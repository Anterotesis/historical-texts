<HEAD>LETTER I. FROM HENRY SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>REJOICE with me, dear Edmund, rejoice! for he is gone. Yes! by all the honest powers, who frown on the unsightly union of age and youth, of decrepitude and beauty, he is departed.—Aye! my friend, departed, like a shadow as he seemed to be, to the region of spi∣rits. That hour, for which you have heard me pant so frequently with all the fervency of an impassioned soul, that blessed hour is at length arrived.—Cornelia, the lovely, the tender, the patient, the dutiful Cornelia is delivered from her Aegyptian bondage; Cornelia is a widow: and what a widow! Oh Heavens! a thousand times more able to exercise and to gratify the im∣perial passion of my heart, than all the boasted virgins that Circassia could exhibit. You have heard me to rave on her graces, her virtues, her enchantment; and with true philosophical phlegm, or with a friendly design, perhaps, to divert me from what you considered as a very hopeless attachment, you have told me that my heart is the dupe of my own feverish imagina∣tion. Yes! you argumentative rogue! I per∣fectly remember how you employed against my
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
passion the united powers of logic and of ridicule. I see you at this moment with that singular, va∣riable, and interesting face of yours, in which the rigid frown of Zeno is perpetually mingling with the wanton smile of Epicurus, I see you arranging your tremendous syllogisms, and pre∣paring to tell me once more, that one of your two positions must be true, that either Cornelia was never half so lovely as I have represented her, or if she was once indeed a perfect model of loveliness, that her charms must have withered, like the leaves of an unfortunate rose, barbarously stationed under the deadly shade of a decaying yew tree.</P>
<P>I have not, you find, either forgot, or forgiven the abominable metaphor, by which you tried, like a rough empiric as you are, to cure my heart by disgusting my fancy; a sort of quackery, that is, I must confess, very frequently success∣ful, and practised with marvellous effect, by the women, in their attempts to annihilate the in∣fluence of a rival! But let me tell you, prophane wretch as you are,
<Q>Aurora Springing from Tithonus' bed,</Q>
was never half so fresh, so enchanting, so divine, as my angelical widow.—I call her mine, because I feel, that I shall be frantic, if I cannot make her so. Yet that pious barbarian, your brother Charles, told me the other day, with a sacerdotal assurance, that I had not religion enough to de∣serve, or maintain her; confound his presump∣tion! were he of any family but yours, I should think him the grossest of hypocrites. Because he has married the fair buxom daughter of a pomp∣ous
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
high priest, the rogue assumes all the arro∣gance of the Catholic Church, and thinks he has a right to send to purgatory all who presume to act, or to think, in a style that differs from his own. He teaches us, to be sure, by his example, a most orthodox system of happiness, for he kisses no woman but his wife, reads no book but the Bible, and labours hard to reinforce the militia of Heaven with a new party of cherubims, as his good woman, after making him a present of twins but a few months ago, looks already as if she intended to double that favour. Deuce take the fellow! while I am laughing at him, I am almost ready to envy his felicity, and I ought in∣deed to tell you, that with his insolent rebuke to me, which I have mentioned, he mingled such an air of concern and benevolence, that I felt a strange sort of momentary doubt in my mind, whether I ought to challenge, or to embrace him. As it generally happens in the disagreeable per∣plexity of a mixed and equivocal sentiment, I did nothing: yet had I been hypocritical, or discreet enough to pursue my own interest, in spite of a ruffled spirit, I certainly ought to have embraced him as the dearest friend I have in the world; since I am sufficiently aware, that he will have great influence on the future destination of my enchanting widow. You know, I suppose, that as he was the favourite relation of Mr. Sedley, he makes a most important figure in his will, as his confidential trustee for the young widow, and those two lovely infants, whom she seemed to have made miraculously, without any assistance of her unequal partner. Pious as he is, I really
<PB N="4" REF="6" MS="y"/>
believe your brother will manage their ample pro∣perty with a faithful discharge of his trust. If I thought him indeed inclined to play the Jew, or the priest, (for with me, I confess, they are almost synonymous) I would willingly give him all the wealth of the widow, to secure me the rapid possession of her heart and hand. Yet I have such a rooted detestation of artifice and falsehood, that I could not play the pious hypo∣crite with him for an hour, if I knew it would make me master of the object I adore.—I must however contrive to associate as much as possible with your brother, and the more so as his wife is the bosom friend of my Cornelia. Pray write me word instantly, if your sister Lucy is now residing with you. I hope from the bottom of my soul that she is, as I know that she and your sister Charles never pass a week without writ∣ing to each other. It is from this quarter alone, that I can at present gain a little unsuspected insight into the heart and spirit of my dear Cornelia. I conjure you by our friendship to obtain for me all possible information concerning her plan of life, her thoughts, her feelings, and every minute article relating to her. Observe this request as you wish not only to promote the happiness, but to preserve the existence of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO HENRY SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>I REJOICE with you indeed, my dear Sey∣mour; but I confess it is with a fearful joy.—You know that I am naturally subject to an anxious timidity concerning those I regard; and if my sympathy in your present transport appears too much chastised by apprehension, you will, I hope, impute, what you may at first consider as a deficiency of spirit, to an excess of affection.— In truth, you are not only in the very limited number of my dearest confidential Friends, but you are the very Friend, whose peculiar qualities and situation have filled me, for some time, with the most affectionate solicitude.—I own to you, that I tremble, lest the mischievous power of Chance should conspire with some of your pecu∣liarities, I should rather say with your only de∣fect, to counteract all the noble advantages you possess. What young man ever entered the world with more abundant means to render it a scene of chearfulness and delight! You have an ex∣cellent constitution, with an engaging figure; you have an ample fortune, without a single in∣cumbrance; you have a gay and brilliant ima∣gination; you have a warm, a benevolent heart; but allow the frowning Stoic to add, you have a
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
precipitancy of spirit, which may rapidly convert all these instruments or Happiness into sources of Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery.</P>
<P>But I abuse the privilege you allow me of preaching against your foibles, in giving you a dull unreasonable sermon, when a little timely railler▪ might not only be more pleasant, but more efficacious. Instead therefore of continu∣ing my dictatorial harangue on your imperfec∣tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, let me only advise you not to write an offer of marriage to your widow, while she is adjusting her weeds; nor a challenge to my bro∣ther, in consequence of that insupportable pro∣vocation—his feeling a sincere wish to see you a good Christian.</P>
<P>Though you tell me I love to touch your foi∣bles wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the caustic of sarcasm, I find that I cannot just with any tolerable grace, or ease, on subjects that may press upon my heart with such serious weight.</P>
<P>There is hardly a circumstance in life which could give me more pain, than a quarrel between you and my brother: and when I consider your respective situations, I shudder at the probability of such an event. It would certainly be most impolitic in you to offend him at present; yet you have such an exalted idea of never sacrificing your sentiments to your interest, that my caution to you on this ground might he more likely to produce, than to prevent the mischief, I would guard against. As I have a most cordial affection both for you and my brother, and a much more intimate knowledge of both than you have yet acquired of each other, allow me to inform you,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
that although you differ on one great subject, there are many points of agreement and resem∣blance beween you, that ought to unite us all in a very firm and inviolable friendship. It was your lot, as you approached towards manhood, to be connected with some mercenary priests, both in humble and high station<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, whose ungene∣rous conduct inspired, or rather inflamed you, with a vehement prejudice, not only against their whole order, but against all persons who are very zealously attached to the Religion they profess. Youth and pleasure have not hitherto allowed your reason sufficient time to examine and correct this early, this unfortunate preju∣dice; and accident perhaps has repeatedly con∣spired with the native ardor of your mind to strengthen the honest indignant feelings on which it was founded. My brother Charles, though he has neither the habit, nor the occupa∣tions of a divine, is indeed a man of as religious a mind, as the church can exhibit: but his Re∣ligion, if I may use such a distinction, is rather constitutional, than acquired; it arises more from tenderness of heart, and sensibility of mind, than from extensive study and profound meditati∣on. His piety is the child of Gratitude, not of Fear; and its chief characteristics are chearful∣ness and benevolence: it is his favorite maxim, that Religion not only takes from us the bitter sense of calamity, but gives a finer zest to all the pleasures of life. His doctrine is indeed very for∣cibly recommended by his example; for he is by many degrees the most happy being that I ever knew.—We all talk you know of God, as our
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
general Parent; but few of us, I fear, are able to look up to him with a true filial spirit. Of all the men whom I have had occasion to observe in this point of view, Charles, I must say, is the only person who ever seemed to repose with the happy affectionate confidence of an innocent child on the bosom of his Creator.</P>
<P>You will begin to suspect that I am metamor∣phosed into a Moravian; or at least that I have caught my brother's enthusiasm without his vi∣vacity: but to confess my own weakness, they are equally beyond ray reach. Connected as we are by nature and by affection, I find there is such an unalterable difference in our characters, that I might as well attempt to acquire the exact turn of his features, as the peculiar cast of his mind. When I am in one of my argumentative metaphysical moods, I reason myself into a con∣solatory persuasion that his great superiority over me, both in goodness and gaiety, is principally owing to a mechanical felicity of frame.</P>
<P>But I am rambling very far from the main ob∣ject of my letter, which is to conjure you not to indulge your wit and imagination in any satirical sallies against the church, and her sons, in the presence of my brother. I do not pretend to say he is right in his maxim, that piety is an essential ingredient in a good husband (the Ladies we know are ready enough to grant a dispensation on this article); but of this I am sure, If Charles is once convinced that you are possessed with the spirit of outrageous Irreligion, he will la our hard to preserve your lovely widow from a connexion, which in his idea, must be productive of misery,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
both to her and her children. If I thought you an absolute debauchee, I should be very fearful of giving you such a hint, because I know, in that case, what your answer, or at least what your conduct would be. You would engage the amo∣rous wishes of the widow in a conflict with the pious advice of her guardian, for the pleasure of watching the battle, and discovering which would be triumphant. But though we have both of us had more resemblance to the libertine, than to the anchorite, in our adventures, I am persuaded that you have a true and chaste affection for this divine little widow, and of course you can never feel a wish to fill her tender bosom with painful disquietude and contention, when fortune seems to offer you the tranquil acquisition of her heart and hand. When I thought that your admiration of her charms could only involve you in a hopeless or a dangerous attachment I endeavoured to laugh away your love; but the great change in your Cornelia's situation has turned me from an opponent into an advocate for your passion. I have now only to conjure you, not to throw any stumbling black yourself into the very inviting primrose path, that is just opened before you. I can truly say, to encourage you, that you have as many advantages for the chace of a widow, as a greyhound has for that of a hare; but remember! the greyhound is sometimes apt to overrun his game, and to lose his prey by the very rap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which seemed to ensure it. I foresee and acquiesce in the justice of your retort; that I have the slow foot of a beagle, and frequently suffer the object of my
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
wishes to escape me, by the tardiness of my pur∣suit. Agreed! but pray recollect what a very useful assistant the flow dog often proves to the swift one.</P>
<P>That I am highly anxious for your success, you will clearly perceive by my writing you so long a letter, without touching on my own less delicate amours. Indeed, I should think it almost a profanation of your divine Cornelia, if I pre∣sumed to talk of the wayward Sylvia in the same page. I will only add therefore that having been wickedly tormented by a mistress, I am particu∣larly solicitous to see you religiously happy in a wife, and let me close that friendly wish with a devout Amen!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. FROM CORNELIA SEDLEY TO HARRIOT AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! my most tender and dearest friend, what a bitter misfortune to me is the pro∣voking little accident, which has confined you
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
to your chamber at a time when my heart and soul have such pressing occasions for your society!</P>
<P>Surely I am destined to be for ever ungrateful; for is there not much ingratitude in this com∣plaint, considering the kind and brotherly atten∣tion that I receive from your excellent husband, and the affectionate manner in which you press him to remain at a distance from you so long as his presence here can be any way serviceable to me and my dear little orphans? Your own heart will witness for me, that I do him only simple jus∣tice in saying, that no man in the world could discharge the mournful office, in which he has so graciously engaged, with more delicate propriety, or with more soothing friendship. Indeed, I know not how poor Cornelia could have supported her existence without him; for in the week, pre∣ceding Mr. Sedley's death, a scene passed between us, which annihilated all the little strength of body and mind, with which I had endeavoured to prepare myself for that most aweful expected event. You will conceive the impression it made upon me, when I tell you, that I have sat down four different days with a firm resolution to give you a minute account of it, and that I have been repeatedly prevented by the bursting tears of an∣guish and self-reproach.—Ah! my dear Harriot, had you been a witness of that distressing conver∣sation, you would no more take the part of your self-reproaching Cornelia. No, you would cer∣tainly join with my own heart in telling me, that as I was not happy in being connected with so noble, so elegant, so affectionate a mind as my departed Sedley's, I can never deserve happiness
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
on earth. Good Heaven! how strangely does the capricious human spirit administer to its own disquietude! How silly a wretch have I been, to live six years with such a man, and not love him with true affection, till the very moment in which he seemed to hover in a middle state be∣tween earth and heaven! In truth, he was much more of an angel than a mortal in the heart-piercing conversation I have mentioned, and of which I will now endeavour to give you the most exact narrative in my power.</P>
<P>I should begin by informing you, that his gloo∣my and querulous disposition, which we found, you know, so grievous and oppressive in the early periods of his long disorder, changed on a sud∣den into a kind of seraphic serenity under pain, which excited in all his attendants admiration and reverence. As soon as he found, by a fair trial, that the waters at Bristol had not the slightest effect on that internal uncertain malady, which had so often deceived his physicians, and preyed in so singular a manner on his wasting frame, his mind seemed to pass from a turbulent state of suspense to a tranquil certainty. He was con∣vinced, for the first time, that he was very soon to die; and the conviction, instead of weaken∣ing, appeared to give new energy to his spirits, his faculties, and his affections. Represent to yourself, my dear Harriot, his wasted, yet man∣ly figure, ten times more emaciated than when you last beheld him, and his piercing eyes endu∣ed, as it were, with a supernatural keenness, that seemed to search the soul of every person on whom he turned them! Behold him wrapt in
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
his loose coat of blue velvet, which you sportive∣ly used to call his imperial robe, and reclining on a sopha, in a silent conflict with internal pain. Behold your Cornelia preparing for her morning task of reading to the poor sufferer, after the removal of our breakfast, at which he had endured as usual extreme torture on the first reception of a little food into his sto∣mach. His pangs had subsided, and he had made me a signal to open the volume of Shakspeare which I held in my hand, when, in∣stead of obeying it immediately, I ventured to say, "If you are persuaded that Bristol does not suit your complaint, why do you not move from an inconvenient lodging into one of your own comfortable houses?" He fixed upon me those eyes of inexpressible quickness; and after a moment's pause he replied, "I will tell you, my dear Cornelia, very frankly: I wish to die here, because I wish to leave you no vestiges of a wretch∣ed scene in either of those habitations, where I hope you are soon to lead a life of quiet, and in due time of joy." His expression struck me in a manner which it is impossible for me to de∣scribe: I felt in it a mixture of the tenderest so∣licitude, and of half disguised reproach; it distressed me to such a degree, that I could not utter a syllable; but my face, I believe, was co∣vered with an half-guilty blush; and tears started into my eyes. He observed my confusion with pity, and drew me hastily towards him. While he was affectionately pressing one of my hands, the book slipt from the other, and accidentally fell open. His quick eye darted on the page be∣fore
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
him, and he instantly exclaimed: Here are words that suit my present feelings exactly; it is my wish to deserve this character from you, my dear Cornelia, and to leave it engraven on your heart:
<Q><L>Nothing in his life</L>
<L>Became him, like the leaving it—He died</L>
<L>As one that had been studied in his death.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have indeed no treasons to confess; but I have pardon to implore! Let me now say to you, my dearest Cornelia, what pride and ill humour have hitherto prevented my saying as I ought— let me say, that I most cordially implore your pardon for many, many sensations of pain and depression, with which the peevish and morose spirit of my distemper, for I will not call it mine, has unjustly afflicted you." This tender unex∣pected humiliation of an imperious, though af∣fectionate mind, pierced me to the soul. I sunk to the ground, and bathing his hands with my tears, I replied, very truly, that his malady was an excuse for every thing; but that a crea∣ture whom Heaven blest with constant health, and who failed in the duty of patient and chear∣ful tenderness to the sick—He interrupted me with the kindest emotion, and raising me to his bosom, he exclaimed: "By Heaven, you have never failed—your life, since our marriage, has been a perfect model of virtue, though not of happiness." My tears gushed with a vehemence that I could not disguise, at this unmerited en∣comium I was on the point of confessing to him, what I have so often Lamented to you,
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
my too tender and indulgent Confessor, that al∣though guiltless of any actual offence, I have of∣ten been such a wretch as to murmur in secret at my destiny; though I formed it myself, in a voluntary and chearful compliance with the wishes of a most affectionate father. A dread of giving unnecessary pain to my generous Sedley prevented my relieving my over-burthened heart by so frank an avowal of all its unworthiness. I only inti∣mated, in words which my agitation I believe ren∣dered hardly intelligible, that if Heaven would spare his life to my prayers, I would shew my∣self more thankful for the blessing than I had hitherto been. He now seated me by his side, in a manner that expressed the tenderest solicitude to tranquillize my spirits. "Be calm, he cried, I conjure you, my dear Cornelia; for it is of great importance to the present relief of my mind, and to your future happiness, that I should have a long and unreserved conversation with you." I sat silent, and half petrified with awful expecta∣tion. "I have wished (he continued) for some days to enter on this discourse; and I feel, that I must not let slip the present hour, because it is most probable that I shall not have another, in which I may possess ease, and strength of body sufficient to utter all I would say to you: No! my dear Cornelia, you must not think of my recovery. There is not indeed a shadow of foun∣dation for any hope of that kind—and believe me, I am willing to die—my affection for you, strange as it may sound, has a tendency to fa∣vour a turn of mind so desirable in a state like mine. I have wished very ineffectually to make
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
you happy; your excellent father had the same passionate desire; and as he had also a strong abhorrence for the profligate manners of our young men, and a fond anxiety to guard you from the miseries of conjugal infidelity, he gave you at seventeen to the arms of his particular friend, whose integrity he considered as much more than a compensation for the difference of our age—that difference indeed was not painfully visible at the period of our union, but every suc∣ceeding year rendered it more apparent, and ac∣cident conspired with time and nature to pre∣clude us from that felicity which he had fondly persuaded himself we were destined to enjoy; flattered by the alacrity with which you obeyed the wish of a father whom you idolized, I was vain enough to suppose that you loved me, before I had in truth merited your tenderness, Eager to improve your admirable understanding, I began to play the preceptor too soon and too sedulously. I bestowed that time and care on the cultivation of your mind, which I ought to have devoted to the acquisition of your heart. I did not per∣ceive my error, and its very natural consequence, till I had been visited for some time by the se∣vere internal malady which has long rendered my existence so painful to myself, and so bur∣thensome to all around me.—You, my dearest Cornelia, have been a very diligent and a very kind attendant to a wretched invalid; but your own heart will inform you, that I am not mista∣ken in saying, you have been so much more from the sense of duty, than from the sentiment of love.—Do not, I conjure you, suppose that
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
I mean to cast a shadow of reproach upon you by what I am saying: on the contrary, I consider myself as making a just acknowledgment to the excellence of your conduct; there is assuredly more virtue in discharging very burthensome and painful duties with the strictest fidelity, than in merely acting from the impulse of an ardent af∣fection. Yet when I have observed your lively spirit depressed, and at times even the loveliness of your countenance impaired, by being involv∣ed so early in offices ill-suited to your youth, I have almost thought it a crime in me to labour for the preservation of a life whose continuance could only lengthen your misfortune. He ut∣tered these words with such an enthusiastic mix∣ture of tenderness and despair, that I could re∣main silent no longer.—I know not however what I attempted to utter, for he soon restrained my end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour to take a part in the conversation, by requesting me to hear what he wished to say of our children; a subject, which he had long been unable to touch upon without a very pain∣ful and distressing emotion! After some affec∣tionate remarks on their infantine dispositions, They have, he said, and I hope they will long have, a mother to whom Nature has given every perfection that belongs to the maternal character: but as it is possible that, when they will stand most in need of paternal admonition, they may find only a nominal father, whose parental solici∣tude may be engrossed by more fortunate chil∣dren—As he was uttering his apprehension, I felt a sort of proud anguish, and affectionate indignation, that I was unable to suppress;
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
and I interrupted him with a vehemence of man∣ner so different from my usual behaviour to him, that he gazed at me in silent astonishment, while I exclaimed: I see the full extent and cruelty of your fears. O Sedley! if I have hitherto failed in affection, let me now give you a convincing proof that you are much dearer to me than you imagine. If it will afford any relief to the fond parental anxiety that afflicts you, I will bind myself by any form of adjuration, or engage∣ment, you can prescribe, to live only for your children, and never, whatever offers may tempt me, to marry a second time.—No words, my dear Harriot, can give you a complete idea of the effect which this sudden, unexpected (and you, I know, will call it) romantic testimony of genuine attachment, produced on the dear in∣valid.—Starting up in a wild agitation of delight, and looking indeed like a being just transported from the grave into paradise, he exclaimed: No, thou divinest of women, I am not such a selfish wretch, as to form a wish so inhuman.— Then drawing me forcibly in his emaciated arms to a pier-glass, at some distance from his sopha, "Look there, my angel, he continued, look there! and let the beautiful image in the mirror inform you what a despicable brute I must be, if, sensible as I am that you have never yet expe∣rienced the delicious passion of love, I could suffer you to make such a sacrifice to generosity, as your angelic soul has suggested, No!—But, my Cornelia, I am referring you to a monitor unfaithful to my purpose: however true that re∣flexion may be to the beauties of your person,
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
your native dissidence will render it a weak inter∣preter of my meaning. Turn then to me alone, and believe the voice of a dying man, who tells you, in a state which admits not any species of adulation, that you are at this moment, both in person and in mind, one of the most lovely crea∣tures with which the great Parent of all loveliness has deigned to embellish this world. Why do I tell you this?—for the kindest of purposes, to impress on your own mind a juster estimate of the perfections you possess, that seeing at once their rare value, and the various dangers to which they may expose their possessor, you may render them no more the sources of disquietude, but the instruments of happiness. Not marry again! Oh, Heavens! my dearest Cornelia, it is my ardent prayer that you may; and in such a manner, that your second marriage may af∣ford you the fullest compensation for all the inevi∣table infelicity of the first.</P>
<P>Here his voice failed him, and a fit of his se∣vere agony came on so suddenly, that I was terri∣fied with the idea of his expiring, as he leant, exhausted and speechless, against my bosom. I contrived however to replace him on his sopha, and after some dreadful writhing of his poor tor∣tured frame, he resumed his discourse with an astonishing coherence and composure. In vain I conjured him not to destroy his reviving strength by farther conversation on a subject at once so distressing, and so unnecessary. I am convinced, my dear Cornelia, he replied, that, at this mo∣ment, you believe it unnecessary; but the day perhaps may come, when you will reflect upon
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
it, as a useful caution, with affectionate grati∣tude. Having been an unworthy partner to you in life, I am the more anxious to have a friendly and beneficent influence on your thoughts when I have ceased to live. Do not shrink from my discourse with such an appear∣ance of distress! —I have but little more to say; but that little may be of great importance to you: hear it therefore, I conjure you; and as the subject is indeed too affecting to us both, I will then dismiss it for ever! — You have little experience of the world; you have naturally an open, lively, unsuspecting temper: you are still so young, that your beauty, striking as it is, has not yet perhaps attained its perfection. You are hitherto (forgive me for repeating this impor∣tant truth), you are hitherto a stranger to the passion, which your bosom is naturally formed to feel in the very height of its purity and its power: —a passion, my dear Cornelia, which, even in a heart so virtuous and so gentle as yours, is forcible and imperious to a degree that you can hardly conceive!—No.! by Heaven! so far from wishing to withhold you from a future marriage, had I the powers of an angel, I would exert them to select for you an object that should render you the happiest of wives. I have not such a privi∣lege; but I can at least caution you against the kind of character that would have the greatest tendency to produce the opposite effect.— Vice, my dear Cornelia, is a still greater enemy to happiness, than a lingering distemper.—Heaven forbid that you should ever be the wife of a man whose profligacy might induce you to regret your
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
departed invalid! —You must indeed be egregi∣ously deceived before this could happen; but how common is such deception in the world: How many men have I known extolled by their acquaintance for infinite honesty of heart, and high sentiments of honour, yet practising every device that could be productive of misery to your sex; and caressed by the polite world in propor∣tion as they merited universal detestation! What examples have we of husbands, who married with every possible advantage of rank, fortune, understanding and person united in either party; yet who have wantonly sacrificed every blessing to a rage for licentious pleasure, and have left a lovely woman to ruin her health by dissipation, or to pine in solitude over her declining beauty, and her deserted children! — But is there any kind of caution, which a woman may consider as her safeguard against misery like this —Yes! my dear Cornelia, there is one, a very simple one, which has chiefly induced me to trouble you with this long discourse. —Let this, I conjure you, be the leading maxim of your life, that he can never be a proper partner for a lovely and inno∣cent woman, who has no sense of his obligations to her Creator! —It is my hope, and my ardent prayer, that you may never bestow your inva∣luable self on any man, however engaging his ac∣complishments, and however numerous his good qualities may be, if his mind is avowedly destitute of Religion. Perceiving that his weak frame was exhausted, to the most alarming degree, by the great exertion of talking so long on a subject that pressed with so much weight upon his heart,
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
I seized with great eagerness the opportunity of replying. I assured him, that since the hour of my birth, no words had ever made an impression at once so aweful and so tender on my mind, as those which he had just uttered. I said this with the strictest truth; and indeed, my dear Harri∣ot, I question if the voice of an angel, giving me counsel from Heaven, could have filled my retentive mind with such grateful admiration. Nor can I think it would have deserved to do so; for though a celestial spirit, descending from a state of beatitude to caution an endangered mor∣tal, might dazzle us in the extreme, and excite our reverence and gratitude, yet I hope it is not profane to say, that in the eyes of affection and of reason, there is something still more admira∣ble in a Being, who, after his temper had been ruined by lingering disease, and his body wasted by incessant pain, instead of being oppressed or engrossed by any dread of increasing tortures and impending death, collected and strained all his faculties to bestow the purest advice, that the lips of friendship could utter, on a woman who had little merited such affectionate, such a gene∣rous attention. Oh, Harriot! if I formerly be∣held him with ungrateful indifference, he is now the object of my idolatry. Alas! what tears have I shed, in reflecting that the cause of my not loving him as I ought to have done was my own unworthiness, and the not possessing a spi∣rit so noble as his.—But I am wandering from my promise, which was, to give you a very full and complete narration of our conference.—I told him, that although I sincerely hoped and believed
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
I should not marry again, yet I should treasure up his counsel, as children do a rich and beauti∣ful pocket-piece, not for use, but for frequent contemplation, as an engaging and valuable me∣morial of regard and affection. I was on the point of uttering a very solemn promise on the religious article he mentioned, when his physi∣cian entered the room.—Enough! my dear Cornelia, cried the generous Sedley; and ad∣dressing himself immediately to his medical friend, he said, with an air of calm Christian triumph in his countenance, You find me, Doctor, as your benevolent spirit would wish to find a patient whom no art can restore. You find me with a bosom greatly relieved, by having just said all that I was anxious to say in this world. I thank Heaven, and this divine atten∣dant (here he pointed to the unworthy Cornelia, with a tone and gesture so affecting that it made me fly to hide my face at the window), I am now so perfectly prepared to die, and so weary of these wasting pains, that I should esteem it a favour, if you could announce to me the certain hour of my release.—I now quitted the room, as I found myself unable to suppress my tears, and indeed I had great occasion to give vent to them in privacy. During the greater part of my poor Sedley's discourse to me, my whole frame was agitated with a conflict of opposite sen∣sations: of reverence and regret; admiration of him, and abhorrence of myself. My heart indeed made several efforts to relieve itself by tears; but they were repeatedly checked by the reflection, that it was ungenerous and cruel to
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
indulge them in his presence. With him there∣fore I wept but little; as soon as I had escaped to my own chamber, I began to weep indeed, like a penitent who wished to efface the offences of many years. Reflecting however that I had still a more painful duty to discharge, I prayed most devoutly for strength and spirits to watch over the poor sufferer, with the most tender and incessant attention, through every remaining hour of a life so rapidly hastening to its close. I felt most sensibly on this occasion,
<Q>That but to ask more goodness is to gain;</Q>
for I soon returned to the poor object of my pray∣er, with the powers of my mind amazingly recruited. It is well for me that they were so, as on opening the door of his apartment I was struck with a scene that at first led me to suppose he had expired in my absence: this however was not the case; but the poor exhausted patient had sunk into a little slumber, which his humane physician had requested him to indulge, with a promise to sit watching by his side. His late ex∣ertion had very visibly produced a considerable diminution of his strength, and the physician enjoined me to keep him as quiet as possible. We religiously obeyed this injunction, which was given on the Thursday; and I believe he did not utter ten words on the two following days; but on the fatal Sunday he requested me to join him in a short and fervent prayer, which he had composed and written for the purpose.— I could hardly articulate the words, which he pronounced in a low voice, yet very distinctly,
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
though at that moment the cold sweat of death was standing on his forehead. In taking the paper from him, as he ended his devotion, I kiss∣ed his hand, which was indeed like clay; when, looking at me with inexpressible kindness and anxiety, he said: Remember, my dear Cornelia, remember that the caution I have given you is not only important to yourself, but to our children! —the last word he could only speak in a confused murmur, and thus he expired in a sudden short agony of parental tenderness.—Oh, my dear Harriot! if it is possible that your Cornelia can ever become such a wretch, as to let the just im∣pression of all I have now related to you be effaced from her heart, be you my monitor! remind me —but no, it is not possible: or if it were so, will not the two dear little beings, whom the departed angel has left me, serve me as perpetual re∣membrancers of his divine solicitude and affection for us all?—Alas! how little are they aware of the loss they have sustained! How affecting is the simplicity and ignorance of deep sorrow which infants discover, to those who are labouring under the pressure of recent grief; When I flew to the dear orphans on my return from Bristol, they caught indeed the infection of my tears, which flew afresh at the sight of the little fatherless creatures: but in the few days that have elapsed since my arrival here, they seem to have lost, not only all traces of sorrow, but all memory of the dead. In such a mere infant as Charles this is perfectly natural; but William surely is old enough to shew more feeling and recollection.—But what a wretch am I to blame my poor child, when I ought rather to consider
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
how often I have failed myself in affectionate duty to the departed! I wish my children to be gay and happy, and yet I am such a fool as to be wounded by the sight of the very chearfulness that I wish them to enjoy. Oh, Harriot! my mind is full of nothing but confused and uneasy sensations; it is only your voice, the voice of true sympathy and friendship, that can calm my ruffled spirits, and reconcile me to myself—Your dear Audley is all goodness to me, and you know I think him a man who has hardly his equal in the world; but I believe the most tender and accom∣plished of men have no comprehension of the thousand little depressive and turbulent feelings, that agitate the heart of a woman who is dissatis∣fied with herself. But as Audley knows that no human being has manners more soothing than our beloved Harriot, he has kindly pressed me to relinquish my design of going immediately to Sedley-hall, for the more comfortable plan of re∣turning with him to you.—As he tells me there is the greatest chance that the accident which happened to your foot may confine you for some weeks to a couch, I please myself with the idea that I shall be the partner of your confinement, and assist in your recovery. The feeling Audley insists on our bringing both my little orphans with us; and I am confident they will both be as welcome to my tender and warm-hearted friend as her desolate and affectionate</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. MR. TO MRS. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>MY dearest Harriot has a spirit to consider my thorough occupation in the service of her friend as a pleasing attention to herself. Pray have the goodness to accept this, not only as a sufficient, but as a handsome apology for a brief epistle from him whose heart has always a great deal to say to you.</P>
<P>We have in truth much serious business to get through before we can return to you: I say <HI>we</HI> —because you will find that I have persuaded your too feeling Cornelia, for whom you are so anxious, to seek present shelter for herself and her little ones under your friendly wing. As I know how full of solicitude you are concerning her, after I have recommended to your im∣mediate attention a certain fair creature with a crippled foot, who is the only being in the world that you are too apt to neglect, I must assure you, that although your friend has been much harrassed in mind, and fatigued in body, I can∣not perceive any material diminution either in

her health or beauty. Nor can I find more than a single fault in her whole composition, and that is a great tendency to load her innocent self with iniquitous reproaches.—In another woman I might perhaps be tempted to think this affecta∣tion; but I know it is in your Cornelia, as you have truly told me, an excess of real sensibility. It is most certain, that all her conduct to the poor unhappy man just released, has not only been irreproachable, but highly meritorious; for, to speak freely of his infirmities, his distemper had rendered him peevish to such an excess, that, had Heaven itself furnished him with an attend∣ant, he would have scolded the poor seraph for flapping even coelestial plumes by the side of his couch.—I lamented his calamity, and revered his virtues; but though common humanity teaches us to forgive and pity the plaintive asperi∣ty of disease, I could not, I own, have attended my unfortunate relation with the unwearied pa∣tience of your Cornelia—of all human defects that exist without a bad heart, a querulous dis∣position is to me the most unamiable—in health and in sickness, it is surely inconsistent with rea∣son and religion: it is, in short, my aversion; and if my lovely Harriot herself could acquire a habit of murmuring at the evils of life, instead of supporting them with that gentle and chearful fortitude for which she is famous, I am appre∣hensive that all her other perfections would not render her so inexpressily dear as she now is, to</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. FROM HENRY SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I Have seen—I have talked with—I have touched her, and the fire of that electrical touch is still dancing in my veins, though I am sitting supperless in a dismal inn; where, in∣stead of hastening either to supper or to bed, as the time of night would induce any less amorous or more fortunate mortal to do, I seize the stump of a pen that has served, I suppose, a hundred travellers to write their adventures, to give you a history of mine.—Ah! if your inhuman brother were not as cruel as a priest, I should have en∣joyed the happiness of passing this night under the roof that protects my adored Cornelia;—yet I must say the pious Barbarian behaved very handsomely, all things considered.—Let me how∣ever
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
grow a little more methodical, and tell you these interesting occurrences in their due order.</P>
<P>To avail myself with the best grace imaginable of your kind hint where I might catch a sight of my Cornelia, I ordered post horses before I had perfectly perused your friendly letter, and hasten∣ed to the house of a certain honest dull 'squire, who resides about thirty miles west of your bro∣ther; and who, with many pressing invitations, could never tempt me before to pay him a shoot∣ing visit. Here I did penance for three days: my good host, you know, has a head like his gun-barrel, full of nothing but powder and shot; but had he possessed the wit of Athens, and the urbanity of Rome, I should, I believe, have thought him a woeful companion, while he de∣tained me from that dear object of my idolatry, to whom my spirit had fled before my limbs could reach her. At last the three days, that appeared to me three centuries, expired, and I set forth for your brother's. Heavens! what a variety of inexpressible sensations I felt in passing Sedley-Hall! The sight of the hatchment, the open windows of Cornelia's chamber, and every ob∣ject of the spot, struck in some forcible manner on my heart, and produced altogether a strange agitation, in which hope and fear, melancholy and exultation, were whimsically blended. I felt I know not what satisfaction in contemplating this deserted abode of the lovely mourner, that I wish to make the smiling scene of our future fe∣licity; yet, as I passed the recent grave of poor Sedley, I felt a cold involuntary pang shoot athwart my bosom—Were I inclined to super∣stition,
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
I should say that his spirit smote me as I crossed his tomb, and forbade me to indulge the ambition of my heart: but my love is too warm and vigorous to be repressed by phantoms; were a legion of ghosts to rise in her defence, they should not bar me from my pursuit: indeed such a legion would not be half so formidable as that single watchful dragon—your brother. I believe it was a scurvy dread of encountering his keen eyes in too long a tête-à-tête before dinner, which tempted me to loiter so in the precincts of Sedley-Hall; I requested permission of the old porter there, to avail myself of the private road which leads through a little string of farms by which Sedley and your brother have very lately con∣nected their respective domains. I contrived to reach Charles's gate just as the first bell was sum∣moning the good folks of his household to a pre∣paration for dinner, and as I entered the hall I met him just come in through the garden-door from a long and dirty walk. I felt, I must con∣fess, more like a thief than a friend; but put∣ting the best face I could on my unexpected in∣trusion, I told him I had taken the liberty of stopping to dine with him, in my road from the west.—He gave me a very polite welcome: I thought I discovered in it more of civility than of joy; and this idea did not tend to diminish my embarrassment; but, to my inexpressible re∣lief, in a few minutes he left me alone in his library, while he retired to change his dress. My heart now began to palpitate at the sound of a female foot in the room above. I had not dared to enquire after the widow; and he, perhaps
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
from delicacy, had not named her to me. A ser∣vant luckily entering the library, I seized the opportunity of inquiring if there was any com∣pany in the house, and if Mrs. Audley was suffi∣ciently recovered from her late accident to dine below. The fellow's answer was so exactly what I wished, that I considered him as my good angel, and was ready to worship him for his blessed intell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gence. In crossing the hall, at the sound of the second bell, I caught the first sight of my angelic Cornelia, employed, angel-like, in supporting the uneasy step of her disabled friend. I had the delight of gazing on them for a minute unperceived, as they came slowly down stairs. In my first compliment I could not help remarking the very touching graces of the position in which I surprized them, and I expressed my wonder that the painters had not more frequently seized a subject so delightful as that of one lovely woman engaged in some act of friendly assistance to another. "O, cried your lively sister, I am afraid the painters, like the greater part of your sex, are a set of wicked creatures, who have no faith in female friend∣ship; but you have luckily hit on a most seasona∣ble piece of flattery; for I was saying to my kind friend here this morning, that if we ever fit for our pictures again, it shall be in the cha∣racters of Celia and Rosalind: for my part (she continued with that graceful vivacity which she possesses you know in a singular degree) I think there is more female heroism in confining your∣self to wait on a cripple, than in wandering with an exile through the pleasant forest of Arden." My heart and tongue were both eager to exclaim:
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
"How blest the man who might become the Oli∣ver to your Celia!" But the sudden appearance of your brother annihilated at once my courage and my compliment. Our dinner, I believe, would have passed very heavily, had not your en∣gaging sister gradually contrived to dissipate the general constraint, and to impart a portion of her own ease and chearfulness to the little circle round her. She deserves in truth to be painted in the character of Rosalind, for she can indeed "do strange things," and seems to have <Q>con∣versed with a magician most profound in his art, and yet not damnable.</Q> She read my heart and soul with that quick intuition with which clever women comprehend all the feelings of a man in love, before he can thoroughly de∣cypher them himself. She rallied me on my vi∣sit to the shooting squire, and did it with that sportive delicacy of expression that she neither distressed me nor my tender widow by her rail∣lery; though I saw that she perfectly knew what magnet had drawn me to her table. As I am naturally sanguine, you know I soon felt myself inspirited by the kindness of her reception. I thought her eyes said to me, I read and applaud your passion for Cornelia; it is impossible for her at present to afford you any thing like encourage∣ment; but I, who am her second-self, and know all her thoughts, will do all that I dare to inspire you with hope. This idea gave me new life: at the close of dinner a very whimsical little inci∣dent happpened, which, trivial as it may appear, I must relate to you at full length, because it filled us all with no unpleasant emotion. While
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
the servants were setting the wine on the table, the eldest of the little Sedleys, the most lovely and wonderful child of five years that I ever saw, came running furiously into the room: his beau∣tiful little countenance was illuminated with a brave indignation; I never beheld such an image of an infant hero; and we soon found that he came on a very heroic errand; for, as soon as he could collect breath enough to speak, he made a very spirited appeal to the alarmed Cornelia against the tyranny of Nurse, who was going to inflict a corporal punishment that he thought very unjust on his little brother: I shall never forget the tone and manner of this marvellous boy—"My papa, said the infant hero, told me, that when he was gone to Heaven I should be the protector of little Charles, and nobody shall whip him for such a trifle!" He uttered this with such an enchanting air of infantine magnanimity, that I could not help catching him up in my arms, and exclaiming, "Heaven bless thee, sweet boy, thou wilt be one of the noblest-minded men that God ever created!" I perceived a tear of maternal transport rush to the eye of my Cor∣nelia; she was greatly affected, and was going to quit the room to regulate this petty distur∣bance; but your brother stopt her, by insisting on his prerogative, as Lord paramount of the nursery, and confined her under the guard of his wife, while he and the little Sedley went together to examine and redress the grievance.</P>
<P>I defy you to guess in a twelve-month the high crime and misdemeanour by which the infant-culp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it had excited the anger of his nurse—
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
Apropos of nurse—You, whose idea of beauty is always connected with that of fertility, and who think a woman never so tempting as when she has a child in her arms; you, I say, would have been frantic at the sight of this beautiful nurse; and beautiful indeed you will suppose her to be, when I confess that I could not help staring at her in the presence of my adored Cornelia—it was a stare of admiration, not of licentiousness; and to prove to you that it was so, when I marry the lovely widow I will send you this admirable creature for your housekeeper. You dread, I know, the galling yoke of Hymen, and you can never find a more eligible substitute for a wise; she is completely in your favourite style of beauty—so rich, so luxuriant, so smi∣ling— in short, a land flowing with milk and honey.</P>
<P>But to return to the infant culprit, and his inconceivable offence— Bless the gay little ur∣chin! his crime was nothing more nor less than a kind hint to me to shorten the mourning of his mother, whom Nature fashioned for joy. It seems the lively urchin, who is still in petticoats, has taken a pleasant aversion to black; as he was just equipped to make his appearance in the parlour in a clean white frock and a new broad black sash, the rogue contrived to seize a large pair of scissars, and made several tremendous gashes in the gloomy decoration of his dress, which he could not reconcile to his joyous ima∣gination. This had excited the anger and me∣naces of nurse, and the generous interference of his elder brother, who exulted not a little
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
when Audley returned to us, as he soon did, with the little rebel in his arms, unwhipt, and beginning to smile again, with cheeks like two crimson roses, and with two forgotten tears stand∣ing like dew-drops in the middle of each. My divine Cornelia displayed a great deal of maternal tenderness, but with infinite good sense, and without a grain of affection. She thought herself bound to chide the young delinquent a little for the sake of vindicating the honour and the authority of nurse. Your brother, with much good humour and pleasantry, played the advocate for his little namesake, and made him very happy by a promise to replace his hateful black ribband by a new one of sky colour. As there was no mode in which I could venture to make immediate love to my tender widow, ex∣cept by caressing and trying to ingratiate myself with her children, you will suppose I was very assiduous in that attempt; and I was luckily so successful, that I soon became the prime favourite of both: never did favourite obtain the influence he wished, with less hypocrisy and adulation; I was in truth the idolater I professed myself. O my divine Cornelia, such is the magic of thy charms, they communicate an inexpressible at∣traction to all that belongs to thee! I protest to Heaven, I do not believe it possible for me to contemplate any offspring of my own either with admiration or with love superior to what I felt in gazing on thy children. You know, my dear Edmund, that I have always had a singu∣lar pleasure in the society of such artless little folks; it is one of my favourite amusements to
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
observe the free play of unsophisticated nature, in their looks, their attitudes, their expressions. The heroism of the elder Sedley inchanted me, and I was indebted to the younger urchin for a transport still more delightful. The sturdy rogue did not relish the mild rebuke of his mother, but began to pout like a young Achilles, and turned his face from her with a sulky grandeur. I undertook to negotiate a peace between them, and contrived, as proxy for the little half-penitent rebel, to imprint a kiss of submissive homage on her imperial hand—imperial I may truly call it, as I felt in touching it by this sportive ma∣noeuvre, that every fibre of my frame acknow∣ledged its sovereign sway. I trembled at my own presumption, though in childish sport; and if my divine Cornelia had possessed less simplicity of character, or less understanding, my freedom might have produced a very foolish and very aukward scene; but, with a grace and delicacy of manner that no words can describe, she ac∣cepted my homage as the act of her child, and seemed not a little obliged to me in her heart for having furnished her with an early pretence for admitting the little half-sullen and half-recon∣ciled rebel to her lap.</P>
<P>When the ladies withdrew, which they did not without a kind memento from your sister that I must drink tea with them before I proceed∣ed in my journey, your brother, in a vein of arch hospitality, plied me with some excellent wine; not forgetting the health of his lovely guest: I drank freely, in the hope of imbibing courage enough to open my heart to him on the
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
great object of its ambition; but the sanctified rogue looked at me with so piercing an eye that he disjointed the exordium of an oration that I was studying for this purpose: I believe he com∣prehended my design, and my want of assurance to accomplish it; for just as we were summoned to attend the ladies at their tea table, he sur∣prised me by the following speech: <Q>My young and agreeable traveller, do not think me an inhospitable Barbarian for not asking you to pass the night under my roof. Come, Sey∣mour, I will be very frank with you; I trust you know enough of me to know that I detest every thing like disguise and duplicity. I am perfectly aware of your serious passion for the very beautiful and amiable woman now under my protection; if the vehemence of love does not blind your own excellent judgment, you will perceive on reflection that I could not invite you to remain with us in this early pe∣riod of her widowhood, without failing in the delicate regard that I owe to the character and the feelings of my lovely charge; but give me your hand, and be assured, that so far from being an enemy to your well-placed affection, I only wish to find every possible reason that may enable me in due time to as∣sist and befriend it.</Q> I caught his extended hand in a transport of gratitude, and could not help pressing it to my lips, as the hand of a gracious monarch who had just raised an aspiring and anxious subject to the pinnacle of honour and of joy. Alas! my gratitude, as you tell me all my passions are inclined to be, was much
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
too precipitate. Hear how the Barbarian pro∣ceeded: "I am disposed to regard you, Seymour, as the bosom friend of a brother who is very dear to me; you have many of his best quali∣ties, but you have also (shall I say) his defect, or his misfortune: I see you understand me but too well, by the angry fire which is kindling in your countenance; but dive into your own heart, and ask it fairly, if you have any just cause of anger against a man who is kindly shew∣ing you what he knows to be the only obstacle in your road to happiness." I was abashed, I own, by the tenderness of this reproof; the hasty and indignant speech I had upon my tongue died away without reaching my lips; and I sate like a sinner in silent confusion, while the triumphant preacher thus continued his dis∣course: "You will acquit me of impertinence in hinting thus remotely at this very serious sub∣ject, when you know that I have some material information to give you concerning it. I need not tell you that my relation, poor Sedley, had, with all his infirmities, a strong understand∣ing, a sincere attachment to religion, and a per∣fect sense of the misery which a want of that attachment introduces sooner or later into all the conditions of human life. In leaving a beau∣tiful, young, and rich woman, in a world full of various temptations, he was too wise to ex∣pect or to wish that she should not marry again; but his knowledge and his goodness induced him to express to her a peculiar solicitude that she should never marry an irreligious man: her re∣solution on this point is settled; and though a
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
libertine might laugh at the idea, it has been set∣tled by circumstances of such uncommon solem∣nity, that I question if any human temptations could lead her to renounce or forget it. The vows of a widow, you may tell me, are prover∣bially frail. I have not forgot our common ac∣quaintance, the fair matron of Ephesus; but neither you nor I can look upon Cornelia as a creature of that class. If indeed, it were pos∣sible for her to waver, my own sentiments, and the duty I owe both to the dead and to the living, must oblige me to exert all the influence I possess to confirm her in so just and so important a re∣solution. You are very young, Seymour; and it is your misfortune, as it was your friend Edmund's before you, to be acquainted with a set of lively and too agreeable infidels, who have led you both, I fear, very wide of that rock upon which alone it is possible to build human happiness! You both, I am afraid, consider Religion either as a mask that hypocrites assume for their interest, or, at best, as a grave bauble for old age to play with. I trust the time will come, when you will both entertain a much truer idea of it, when you will both agree with me in thinking, that the very beautiful enco∣mium which Tully bestows on Literature, is still more applicable to Religion, that it is "the friend of every season and situation, the guard and ornament of prosperity, the refuge of af∣fliction." But, I ask your pardon, the ladies expect you; a single glance from the woman you love will have a much better chance of con∣verting you than fifty sermons of mine. I will
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
only say, detach yourself from your profane as∣sociates, make yourself religiously worthy of the divine Cornelia, and I shall have infinite delight in placing her in the arms of a man so accom∣plished. And now, having ventured to do it thus metaphorically, let me literally shew you the way to her, by conducting you up stairs. Without waiting far a reply, which in truth I hardly knew how to make, he led me to the drawing-room. There was certainly much of the friend in his address to me, but there was also a bitter dash of the parson and the dictator that I was unable to swallow: as I followed him up stairs my proud splenetic fancy for a moment subdued even my love. I considered Cornelia her∣self, in a sarcastic point of view, as a new sort of Penelope, who was to make a trial of her lo∣vers, not by a strong bow, but by the number of chapters they could read in the Bible; but the instant I beheld her lovely angelical figure at the tea-table, every particle of my pride and spleen evaporated. I flew, all joy and tender∣ness, to her side; and while her snowy hand was gracefully presenting a dish of tea to me, I was ready to exclaim, from the book I have just mentioned, <Q>Intreat me not to leave thee (or to return from following after thee) for whither thou goest I will go: and where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</Q></P>
<P>But I repressed my rapture, or rather adopted a mode of indulging it, which, instead of being exceptionable, was sure of exciting sympathy and approbation. I talked to Cornelia of her chil∣dren.
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
I dwelt on the engaging presage of a fine manly character, which the little incident after dinner had shewn us in her elder boy. She lis∣tened to me with visible delight. I am convinc∣ed there is no mode of attacking the heart of a truly amiable widow so effectual as that of mak∣ing her own child serve you in the character of Cupid. It has some advantages over the strata∣gem which Venus herself employed in behalf of Aeneas, when she conveyed the fictitious Iulus to the lap of poor Dido, and the urchin, in seeming only to repose on her bosom, set it se∣cretly on fire. As I think myself, without va∣nity, a much honester man than the pious Aene∣as, who, like the religious rascals of every age, played a thousand dirty tricks in the name of Heaven, I trust that my dalliance in its end will be very different from his, and that I shall turn my widow into a happy wife, instead of driving the fair creature to hang herself; a fate that the generous Dido could not surely deserve, even for the extreme folly of having surrendered her charms to a sniveling, canting, treacherous hypocrite, who had the impudence to call him∣self a hero.</P>
<P>But I find, to my infinite surprize, that I have been writing half the night; it is time for me to get to bed, and no longer persecute either you or the poor chamber-maid and waiter; who, having exhausted all the little worn-out love that they have for each other, are yawning and cursing the strange gentleman for writing at such unseasonable hours. The conclusion of my day's adventure may be told in few words: after
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
a very short hour's conversation, which turned chiefly on the education of children, and the force of female friendship, I tore myself from the presence of my divine Cornelia; and the pain that I felt in doing so, made me, I appre∣hend, very aukward and very ungracious, in taking leave of my host. Every circle of the wheels that conveyed me from his house seemed to raise a new reservoir of spleen in my bosom; and before I reached your old acquaintance, mine hostess of the Garter, who, by the way, is half dead with dram-drinking, I had devoted your pious brother to all the devils, for a per∣verse provoking Methodist, who would persuade a blooming widow, full of warm desires, not to admit an honest man to her bed till she had heard him repeat his Catechism. Adieu! I am as sick and as full of spight as a monkey half-starved by a miser who pretends to feed and caress it. I am however willing to persuade myself, that the greater part of my malady arises from my horror of the few ensuing months in which it will be impossible for me to catch another sight of my dear idol. You may do much towards my cure, if you can fill up this dreadful void in my existence by employing me in your service. I have no relish for the remedy that Ovid and Lucretius (great doctors both!) have prescribed for my disorder—I would rather avoid than go in quest of licentious pleasure. I feel indeed at present that friendship alone can be a tolerable substitute for love. Make my chastity, if you please, the slave of your incontinence, by ap∣pointing me the guardian to some pregnant

<HEAD>LETTER VI. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO HENRY SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>AS you seem sufficiently disposed to condemn the waywardness of your own agitated spi∣rit, and your splenetic injustice to my brother, I will spare you the lecture you deserve on that copious topic. Matters of a more grievous na∣ture demand our attention; you wish me to fur∣nish you with some interesting occupation!
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
Alas! my dear Seymour, I am but too able to comply with your request: I can instantly em∣ploy you, not in my service indeed, but in that of humanity; if you have leisure, as I know you have spirit enough, to embark in a very mournful office, that must cost you a great deal of time, and may involve you in great trouble and expence; but, on the other hand, it will afford you the delight of atchieving the most charitable exploit, and, of course, raise you high in the estimation of your divine Cornelia, But why do I trifle, in suggesting interested mo∣tives, to engage a heart like yours in the succour of a lovely afflicted creature, whom calamity has visited in a strange land; it is a beautiful foreign∣er, quite unknown to you, and bowed to the earth by the severest anguish that I ever saw a female boom endure, whom I wish you (as soon as I can restore her a little more to herself) to con∣vey back to the house of an ill-judging father, which she deserted in a moment of natural anger and ill-starred affection. I will give you the wretched story as briefly as I can: I believe you once saw a young friend of mine, whose name was Peverell; yes, I recollect you saw him, by your having remarked that he was the most perfect model of manly beauty that you ever beheld. Alas! my dear Seymour, tears drop upon my paper while I tell you that his fine form, which was every way inferior to his soul, has been suddenly dashed to pieces, by an accident too hideous for description! You, who know the warmth of my friendship, will conceive what I felt on the first horrible surprise of this intelli∣gence.
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
The unexpected death of a being, so young and so accomplished, must be distressing in any state; but there are peculiar circumstances that render the anguish of this event inexpressibly severe. Peverell loved me as you love me, and made me the confident, or rather the guide and ruler of his most secret concerns: in a very neat but small cottage, that belongs to me, and stands in a most sequestered spot about a mile from my house, he had deposited the concealed treasure of his once warm and gallant heart, the lovely foreigner I have mentioned. She is the child of an old and rich merchant in Genoa, in whose house my lost friend resided a considerable time: the young couple were instructors to each other in their respective languages, and soon conceiv∣ed a vehement and mutual passion. Poor Peve∣rell, whose mind had a strong natural biass to every thing honourable, thought seriously of marriage, and sounded the father. The old man took care to make both parties comprehend, that he would sooner put the girl into a grave, than into the arms of any man who was not a person of rank in his own republic; and she, in the height of her insulted love, very naturally thought, that a father deserved to lose his child for a sentiment so proud and inhuman: she per∣suaded the man she adored, who was indeed as worthy of her idolatry as a human being could be, to decamp suddenly with apparent indigna∣tion, promising to join him in secret at the first sea-port, and embark with him for England. Her character is one of the most singular that I ever met with in her sex: from the steady ar∣dour
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
and energy of her mind, we might suppose her an antient Roman. On her landing here, she declined the immediate offer of a private marriage, from a generous idea that it might ruin the man she idolized, as she knew his depen∣dence on a rich and ambitious uncle; all I wish, she said, at present, is to have the delight of feeling myself indebted to you for innocence and freedom: had I remained with my father, he would have forced me into marriage with a wretch I despise; and misery might have led me, as it leads many others, into all the enormities of guilt. I consider myself as your wife in the eye of Heaven; and I care not for the opinions of earth: I have a pride and delight in conti∣nuing an absolute dependant on your love, be∣cause I know your heart sufficiently to be assured that you never abandon a woman for an excess of tenderness and generosity.</P>
<P>With these romantic sentiments, and with a marvellous and most engaging simplicity of life and manners, the lovely Giuliana had lived al∣most two months under my private inspec∣tion, attended by a little female orphan, whom she treats rather as a younger sister than a ser∣vant, as the girl, whose age is about twelve, is particularly endeared to her, by being the daughter of her deceased nurse, and of an un∣fortunate honest fellow who lost his life in trying to recover some shipwrecked merchandise of her father's. The charms, the character, and the situation, of Giuliana, soon made me love her as a sister or a child; and I urged the poor ill-fated Peverell to try his influence with his uncle
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
Sir Richard, and, without confessing the secret of the lady's presence in England, to obtain his consent to marry the object of his ardent affec∣tion, by describing her, as she really is, the beau∣tiful daughter of an opulent father. I had re∣ceived a letter from my friend, who had left us for this purpose, to tell me, he saw little possibi∣lity of succeeding with his uncle; and I was writing him a long letter of advice, when his faithful valet, a most excellent and kind-heart∣ed fellow, entered my study, more like a spec∣tre than a living man; this good creature, whom I shall love as long as I exist, for his fidelity and feeling, had rode to tell me, as soon as possible, what he could not utter when he stood by my side; he had only voice enough to say, "Oh, Sir—my dear master!"—and sunk in a kind of hysteric fit, from the united effects of sorrow, emptiness, and fatigue. When I had a little re∣stored him, he related to me the horrid calamity occasioned by an unruly horse; and as he de∣scribed the death of my poor friend with all the strong pathos of genuine affliction, our tears flowed apace, when the feeling Robert suddenly exclaimed to me, "Ah, Sir, we have reason to weep for him, for he loved us both; but what will that tender soul poor madam Giuliana do!—O Sir, I can never tell her he is dead! — No; I had rather be dashed to pieces myself than tell her! O Sir, you do not know how she loves him! You may think she was his mistress, per∣haps; and to be sure I thought so once; but it is no such thing; they lived as pure as two angels, to my certain knowledge, Dear lady—nobody
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
knows but myself how virtuously she loved my poor master! and well she might; for to be sure he was the handsomest and the kindest man in the world. Alas! poor lady—left all alone in a strange country! But as long as I live she shall never want a servant; and I am sure, Sir, you will be a kind friend to her."——This heart-felt eulogy and lamentation from an honest do∣mestic proved of infinite service to me; for the artless and pathetic manner in which the poor fellow delivered it, drew from me a very plenti∣ful shower of tears, which rendered me much fitter than I should otherwise have been to en∣gage in the mournful duty that he so feelingly recommended to my attention. My first care was to recruit the exhausted frame of the faithful Robert himself: having ordered him into a warm bed, I sate myself on the side of it, to be sure of keeping him quiet, and to meditate on the best plan of preparing poor Giuliana for a calamity which was soon to change her present chearful∣ness into the deepest affliction My meditation was soon disturbed, by the starts of poor Ro∣bert, who no sooner got a little slumber than it was broken by terrific visions of his master's man∣gled body, or of the distressed Giuliana. As the latter seemed to dwell most on his spirit, I hoped to make the good fellow's compassion administer to his own recovery, by telling him (what in∣deed I believed) that nothing could preserve his mistre's from immediate distraction but his sum∣moning up resolution enough to vouch for the truth of every thing that I should find it expedient to say to her, to prevent her obtaining any sudden
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
certainty of the horrible event. The honest fellow seemed to gain new life from this idea, and was very firm in his promises and his inten∣tions. He conjured me to let him rise and at∣tend me immediately to the cottage, lest in his return to Warwickshire he should be too late to attend the funeral of his master, whose poor mangled frame was to be deposited, as soon as possible, in the church where many of his gallant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> repose, and which stands within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Sir Richard's Park. If poor Robert and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been going to execution, we could not, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>eve, have suffered more than we did, in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the residence of Giuliana. It was still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the morning; and my lovely charge, who has a great deal of devotional enthusiasm in her character, was singing to her harp one of the most simple sacred airs of Marcello; this was a cruel incident to me and Robert, for at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e first sound of her pathetic melody half of the strength we had summoned for the occasion de∣serted us. Giuliana saw us from her window, and flew to let us in, with her usual vivacity and delight; but her features changed on the first glimpse that she caught of ours: "What is the matter! —where is my dear Peverell! said the tender Giuliana, with all the wildness of terrified affection. I endeavoured, with all the firmness I could collect, to persuade her that my friend was only confined by a very trouble∣some, but not a very dangerous illness, and that, knowing our solicitude, he had dispatched the faithful Robert to give us a clearer account of him than he was able to write. She then de∣clared
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
herself resolved to fly to him immediately, and attend him through his sickness, at any hazard of her reputation of her life. She ut∣tered this resolution with such an air of fondness and magnanimity, that it overthrew all the promised fortitude of Robert, and the poor fel∣low burst into tears. "O Christ!" exclaimed the quick Giuliana, fixing her keen eyes upon him, "my Peverell is dead! yes, I see clearly he is dead, by that honest fellow's distress." I tried to remove her from Robert, and still to conceal from her the truth; but pushing me gently from her with a majesty of affliction that I could not resist, the said, with the most heart-piercing tone that I ever heard, "Robert, you never told me a falsehood in your life: I charge you, do not deceive me in a point so near my soul as the health of your dear master; answer me! —O GOD! you need not! —I see that he is dead!"—The solemnity of this appeal utter∣ly overwhelmed the poor servant. He burst into a fresh agony of tears, and said to her, "O my dear lady, you are an angel; and though I resolved to tell you a lye for your own sake, I have not power to do it."—He then looked at me, as if dreading my rebuke; but seeing that I also was unable to repress my tears, the poor fellow seemed a little consoled for his pardonable weakness, and withdrawing from us its fast as he could, shut me and the desolate Giuliana into her little parlour, where we sat silent together for many minutes in a lifeless sor∣row that seemed to absorb all the faculties of both.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54"/>I intended, my dear Seymour, to give you a most minute detail of all the conversation that has passed between me and this most interesting mourner; but two things, I find, will oblige me to contract the limits of this history: First, I am pressed for time, as I wish to bring you speedily to my aid; and secondly, the scenes I have already gone through for this unfortunate lovely creature have left so strong and recent an impression upon me, that I find I cannot relate them to you very minutely without suffering in the relation much more than you would wish me to suffer. I will only say, therefore, that I never be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld affliction which appeared to me so much the affliction of the heart as poor Giu∣liana's. Instead of bursting into those vehe∣ment expressions of distress which I expected from the natural vivacity of her character, her grief has been calm and concentrated in her bo∣som; she sheds no tears, and speaks as if there was hardly life enough in the organs of her voice to permit her to articulate. She made but one request to me —it was a very distressing one, yet made in such a manner that I would willingly have encountered any difficulties in the world rather than have barbarously thwarted this fond and natural desire of her heart and soul. You will probably guess that her desire was to fold once more in her arms the dear breathless idol of her affection; and you will think me little less romantic than yourself, when I inform you that I have really taken a long journey, and ac∣tual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stolen at midnight into the residence of the dead, to gratify this angelic mourner.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/>Woe to the marble-hearted philosophers, who insult real sorrow by their pretended consolation, which the bosom of the afflicted is just as able to receive, as the lips of the dead are to open for a cordial! The only way, I believe, to tri∣umph over true grief of heart is, to indulge it in all the vehemence of its fond desire; it was by this method that I have gained an influence over the feeling spirit of the afflicted Giuliana, which I could not otherwise have acquired. But you will want to know some particulars of our secret admission to the tomb. I contrived it thus: I let the faithful Robert return with all the expe∣dition he wished, and supplied him with money to purchase for me the private assistance of the sexton. This man happened to be my old ac∣quaintance, as he had often attended me and my poor departed friend, in our shooting parties, when Sir Richard was abroad, and his young nephew had the command of his domains. The honest fellow lives in a cottage, just without the park pale, by the side of the high road, and picks up some shillings in a year by shewing his church, in which there are a few curious old monuments. Being very desirous to keep our expedition as secret as possible, we managed so as to reach the cottage of the sexton between eleven and twelve at night. The faithful Ro∣bert had not only met us at the Inn we appointed, but, to shew his uncommon solicitude for his afflicted mistress, had contrived, by his intima∣cy with the innkeeper, to act himself as our pos∣til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on. This unexpected and touching proof of delicate attention paid to her sorrow by this
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
feeling domestic, drew from Giuliana the only tear that I observed her to shed in our journey. As we found the sex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n perfectly prepared to at∣tend us, we pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed on foot to cross the park-style, and walked by a triple row of old and venerable trees that lead to the church. The night was particularly clear, and the moon in her fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ter; never in my life had I taken a nightly, walk so affecting. Giuliana leant on my arm; but a sacred horror seemed to have sealed up the lips of both, and we glided into the church as silent as two ghosts returning to their graves: I had stored my pocket with drops and cordials, lest any weakness or panic should oppress the nerves of my dejected and almost lifeless companion; but, to my surprise, she discovered nothing of that chill terror which the time and the scene were so likely to inspire; on the contrary, animation seemed to rekindle in her frame, in proportion as she drew nigh to the dear source of her sorrow. I confess my own heart was chilled within me, when the sexton, who now preceded us with a glass lantern, with which the careful Robert had supplied him, opened the massive and hollow-sounding door of an extensive vault, that holds two regularly mar∣shalled ranks of the dead, in mouldering mag∣nificence; in this vault there are two iron g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e, for a circulation of air, and it happened, as we entered, that the beams of the moon were ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed through one of these on a fresh coffin of sky-coloured velvet and silver ornaments. Giu∣liana sprung from me at the sight of it, and em∣braced the coffin with a passionate vehemence;
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
she soon found that the lid had been left unfasten∣ed for her gratification, and having seized the right hand of my poor departed friend she clapt it wildly on her own heart. A ghastly smile of mingled agony and delight was now visible in her pale face: I began to fear from her looks and gesture that her brain was turned by the im∣pression of the scene; and I repented my indul∣gence, especially when she requested, with the air of settled madness, permission to live in that vault, promising not to destroy her own life, but to receive a daily supply of bread and water from the poor sexton. I never endured a moment to distressing: I was obliged to speak to her in a tone of authority, and indeed of reproach, very foreign to my heart. "Have you forgot, said I, that Peverell was my friend as well as yours, and that his spirit now enjoins me to guide and protect you? is it not ungrateful to us both, to reward me thus for indulging the request of your affliction?" She fell on her knees at this rebuke, and kissed my hand; then joining it to the cold hand of her dead lover, she kissed them both together, and thus took a most affecting oath of implicit obedience to me. I hastened to use the power I had gained by leading her out of the vault, but was soon distressed by a new petition to return to it, for the sake of taking a look of hair from the corse; but I insisted on giving this commission to the faithful Robert, who had attended us. I hurried my tender charge, as fast as possible, into the open air. I must reserve all the particulars of our return till I have the comfort of seeing you, which I
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
trust will be very soon. Let me add, however, that I am now very far from repenting of this mournful expedition: I take, indeed, an honest pride in the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I have acted; as I am con∣vinced that nothing could have so well prepared my disconsolate companion for regulating her fu∣ture conduct as I wish her to do; she has still in her countenance and manners the deep traces of intense affliction; but I can perceive that her grief is gradually melting into a tender and di∣vine melancholy: as long as Peverell lived, I kept his secret so faithfully, that Giuliana was unknown even to my sister Lucy, who was under my roof at the time of the fair stranger's arrival at her cottage. I had many reasons for this reserve; but the death of my friend and the affliction of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s lovely mourner having removed them all, I have borrowed the assistance of my sister in consoling Giuliana; they have contract∣ed a great regard for each other, and I had thoughts of going abroad myself with my sister that we might both enjoy the delight of restoring this ill-fated, but amiable fugitive, to the house of her father: some very important private con∣cerns of our family will render this project im∣practicable, and I know not the man on earth to whom I would willingly resign this delicate office except yourself. Perhaps it would interfere too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith your present very anxious pursuit; at all events I intreat you to hasten to me, and let me at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st have the satisfaction of consulting you in person on a business of infinite moment to the afflicted heart of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. FROM MISS AUDLEY TO MRS. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>PRAY quit the apprehensions which you good souls have conceived, concerning the morals and the discretion of our dear brother Edmund▪ Believe me, the fine story of his being entangled with an Italian mistress is a fiction of that artful toad-eater in petticoats who related it so circum∣stantially, and who is, you know, in my opi∣nion, the great nuisance of your neighbourhood. Like most of her mischievous stories, it cuts like a sword with a double edge, from being a mix∣ture of falshood and of truth. Yes, you may look as grave as you please upon it, but it is even so: we have had an Italian lady concealed in our cottage; but let me add, that if one of our family had been tempted to sleep with her, it would have been your humble servant Lucy, and not the innocent Edmund: not but my sage and systematic batchelor, as he styles himself, is some∣times a traitor to his own Platonic philosophy; yet, as he comes to me, like a culprit to his con∣fessor, for spiritual admonition, I have hopes of working a very complete reform in his conduct, though none of seeing him a married man. To confess my own self-interested nature very frank∣ly, as we live on such pleasant terms together, and as I think the chance a thousand to one
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
against his being so fortunate in marriage as a certain married brother of mine of your lady∣ship's acquaintance, I have no very earnest desire that Edmund should cease to be a batchelor; yet, if he were really enamoured of this fair Italian, who has frightened you and your good man so dreadfully, as I am absolutely in love with her myself, and have not alas the power of meta∣morphosing myself into a husband, I should most vehemently wish for Edmund's success. After this honest declaration, if you are not dying with an encreased curiosity to know all that I can tell you concerning this bewitching "she of Italy," to borrow a phrase from Shakspeare, you must certainly be something more than mortal</P>
<P>And now am I ready to quarrel with my foolish self for having talked with such an air of flip∣pant, unfeeling levity, of a most admirable crea∣ture, in the utmost grief and anguish, perhaps, that a human bosom can experience; but the truth is, your alarm concerning the philosophical Edmund's being suddenly ruined by a foreign courtezan hit my fancy so ludicrously, that I could not help smiling, though with a heart full of sorrow, for our lovely Giuliana. How to tell you who our lovely Giuliana is I hardly know, except by repeating, that she is the most afflicted and the most interesting creature I ever met with; but, as so brief a description will not, I am sure, content you, I must add, that she is the daughter of a rich merchant in Italy, and was tempted, by the most dangerous and insinuating of all modern tempters, Love, to visit England, with that wonderfully handsome and unfortunate
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
young friend of Edmund's, whose calamitous death you mention so feelingly. Poor Peverell had deceived himself with the hope of being able to make his stately proud uncle receive, and even love Giuliana as his niece. The horrid accident we are all lamenting hurried him out of life, not only before he had made any successful advances in this chimerical project, but before he had taken care, as he certainly ought to have done, to provide for the subsistence of this lovely stran∣ger, in case of such a calamity as it has pleased Heaven to inflict; yet, full as he was of all the sanguine hopes that generous love can inspire, added to the natural high spirits of youth in per∣fect health, we cannot wonder that he forgot to reflect on his mortality. The consequence, how∣ever, of such forgetfulness might have been cruel indeed to the desolate object of his affection, if it had not pleased Heaven to raise a guardian, I might say a new and better father to the distressed Giuliana, in our kind-hearted Edmund. The lovely romantic girl, who perfectly understood her lover's absolute dependence on his uncle, had repeatedly declined a private marriage, from a very generous resolut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, of not becoming the wife of the man she adored while there was a chance that such a step might involve him in rain. She had, indeed, two events to expect: Sir Richard is neither young nor healthy; his consent, or his death, might have settled our beautiful stranger in the station she deserved to fill. There appeared a fair chance, that one or other might soon improve her situation; and, as she had an entire reliance on the truth and gene∣rosity
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
of her lover, she was contented to abide this chance, in what most women would have thought a wretched and humiliating obscurity, though under the protection of Edmund.</P>
<P>I must do my brother the justice to say, he kept the secret of these unfortunate lovers with so much fidelity and address, that I knew nothing of Giuliana, though she had resided many weeks in a neighbouring cottage, till the season of her distress. Edmund, who has indeed behaved to her like a father, then made us known to each other, in the hope, which I have not, I trust, utterly disappointed, that I might assist him in the very difficult task of healing, or rather sooth∣ing, the wounded spirit of this lovely mourner. As you are now acquainted with the singularity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her situation, you may, in some measure, conceive the intense grief occasioned by a loss so unexpected, which rendered her the most desolate of beings.</P>
<P>When she ventured to quit the house of her father, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uling passion is money, she made it a point of honour to leave him her jewels, and to take from him nothing of value, except indeed herself—a treasure that he seems never to have estimated as he ought. As to her departed lover, his heart was much richer than his purse: his allowance from the sparing Sir Richard never equalled his expences; and his love being of too noble a kind to shew itself in costly trifles, he had made his mistress no such presents as might on a sudden exigence be converted into gold. Thus, it my brother had not stood like a good angel by her side, the young, the beautiful, the
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
chaste, and lately opulent Giuliana, might have been reduced, with her little Abigail, a sweet orphan girl of twelve years, either to beg her way home to an enraged father, or to seek sub∣sistence among strangers by some humiliating oc∣cupation. The bare idea of such a lovely crea∣ture falling suddenly into such penury and wretchedness makes my heart shudder whenever it recurs to my mind; but our tender Giuliana never felt her misfortune in this hideous point of view; she felt only the loss of him by the light of whose countenance alone she appeared to exist; and she felt it so intensely, that Edmund assures me it was the passionate desire of her soul to be shut up from the world, and end her exist∣ence in the vault that holds the shattered frame of her ill-fated lover. I will tell you, one day or other, all that our dear Edmund has done to in∣dulge the wildness of her affliction; at present I must only say, that no Don Quixote ever exerted more generous spirit to restore a distressed fair-one to her living Lord, than our brother has done to gratify the intense grief of this true and engaging mourner for the gallant youth she has lost. His success has been equal to his good in∣tention. I never saw gratitude expressed by any human being in a manner so touching as Giuli∣ana's in expressing hers to us both. It is not by saying she is obliged to us, but by shewing, in a thousand undescribable ways, that her gratitude i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by no means inferior to her excessive affliction; by letting us see that she makes her poor broken and bleeding heart submit itself entirely to the guidance of my brother; and that he has gained
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
an influence like that of Heaven over her actions and even her will. I have really had a great, though melancholy delight in contemplating the very singular regard which compassion on his part, and sorrow and gratitude on hers, have produced between them. I never behold any human attachment more affecting; and Edmund, you know, has imparted to me his habit of mo∣ralizing on our passions and affections. My con∣templations, I confess, are very apt to be infected with feminine weakness; and to tell you an honest truth, I could not behold the influence of Edmund and Giuliana on each other without finding an idea of their union perpetually ob∣truding itself on my reluctant mind; yet, as I own the idea was very insuitable to the time and circumstances, I never mentioned it to either, and I will pawn my life that it never occurred either to the one or the other. Edmund is so very anxious to have this tender unhappy fugitive safely restored and reconciled to her father, that we had thoughts of taking a trip to Italy, for the satisfaction of escorting her home. How charm∣ing would this have been, to have united huma∣nity and pleasure so delightfully! But, alas! the provoking legal business, which we now find in such a train as to require our presence in Eng∣land for some months, is an insuperable bar to this captivating project. Edmund, however, has been so fortunate as to find a charitable proxy, to his heart's content. Giuliana and her little attendant are set forth this morning on their re∣turn to Italy, under the guidance and protection of his friend Seymour, who, after passing a few
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
days here, has undertaken, in the most delicate and generous manner, not only to convey the two forlorn foreigners to their own country, but to accomplish a reconcilement between Giuliana and her father, exactly in the way that my bro∣ther had devised.</P>
<P>So you really think that your sweet friend Cornelia has conceived, without knowing it, a real passion for Seymour. I am not at all sur∣prized at it; especially after the diverting anec∣dotes you tell me of the fondness which her chil∣dren have conceived for this engaging mortal. I own, if I were a widow myself, nothing would win me so soon as the perceiving a man beloved by my children, and of course very fond of them. I believe Seymour is perfectly sincere in his pre∣sent extreme passion for the widow; but were I in her case, I should tremble for the issue of the expedition in which he has so gallantly embarked. To travel so far, by land and by sea, with a most beautiful creature, in the most interesting of all possible situations! —Well, I will only say, if he continues steady in his attachment to your Cor∣nelia, he is a Phoenix of a lover, and deserves to be cherished accordingly.</P>
<P>As our dear Edmund is apt, you know, to be very profound in his projects of benevolence, he has a double view in committing Giuliana to the care of his friend. But, to explain this, I must tell you a circumstance in which your good hus∣band will triumph not a little, as it affords a striking confirmation of his favourite maxims, concerning the use and efficacy of devotion in every period of life. Pray desire him, therefore,
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
to take notice, that this piece of information is addressed particularly to himself; and he, I am sure, will not suppose me mistaken, when I tell him, that although Edmund's very tender and parental attention to the desolate Giuliana had great influence in soothing her sorrow, yet, in truth, it is religion alone that has enabled her wounded spirit to surmount the calamity which appeared to crush it. From all the particulars of her story, I am convinced that she felt for the unhappy Peverell as pure and as strong a passion as the female bosom is capable of feeling. The devotional turn of her mind has converted her love into literal und surely happy and pardonable adoration. She considers this dear object, not as hurried out of life to leave her without a guardian, in the thorny and dangerous paths of the world, but as transported to Heaven, to secure for her, and to share with her, everlasting felicity. She thinks herself not only awakened and directed by this angelic guide to save her own soul, but to attempt and accomplish the salvation of her father. She is persuaded, and perhaps with some truth, that both have been deficient in their re∣spective duties, from being equally blinded by two different deceivers, Interest and Love. Your husband would be marvellously delighted by her pathetic eloquence on this devout subject. In∣deed, I hardly think it possible for the most har∣dened Infidel to hear her without tears, and without paying the lovely preacher at least such a compliment as Agrippa paid to Paul. It is on the sweet magic of this heavenly sorrow that our good Edmund h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s built some very friendly hopes
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
in behalf of Seymour. He is willing to be∣lieve that a long attendance on this engaging mourner, this divine enthusiast, may cure that too light though agreeable and generous young man, of the alarming irreligious levity, which is the only blemish in his attractive character. For my own par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I must say, though I think the ob∣servation does not become a spinster, I fear there is more benevolence than probability in Ed∣mund's idea. I am afraid the expedition may rather lead this too lively creature into a profane passion for the beauty before him, than into a religious attachment to an absent fair. I must however do him the justice to say, that he shews the most delicate respect to the grief of Giuliana. But his esteem for her devotion I can guess, by one of his sprightly remarks to me concerning her present views. The rogue said, he did not apprehend that any piety was strong enough to cure a young woman of Love, or an old man of Avarice. I should add, however, that after op∣posing Giuliana's return to the old miser, to use his own words, he became an absolute convert to the reasoning of my brother, and appeared to sympathise with him most cordially in his wish of reconciling the dear lovely devout girl, and her outrageous father.</P>
<P>I am charged, by Seymour, to solicit both you and your Cornelia to honour him with some commissions abroad; and I have promised to convey to him your respective commands. As your friend has so sweet a voice, I think you can∣not do better than desire a complete collection of all the airs sung by our dear Giuliana. My bro∣ther
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
says, she has an infinite variety of songs, unknown in our country, and wonderfully sweet. Besides their intrinsic merit as musical composi∣tions, they will have an additional charm to all of us, in recalling the lovely image of Giuliana to our minds. The attractions of her character are such, that even you and Cornelia, who have never beheld her beauty, will yet have a pleasure in thinking of her, when Edmund and I have had sufficient opportunities to tell you a thousand little interesting anecdotes relating to her short residence in our country.</P>
<P>At present I must add but a few lines to this enormous pacquet, for which I shall hope to be as amply repaid, by a full history of all the new discoveries that you may have made in the heart of Cornelia. Pray send, if you dare, a few ani∣mating words for me to dispatch to the generous guardian of Giuliana on his travels. There is some virtue in this petition, for it may keep him constant to his present chaste passion, to give him some prospect of future success. I am ready to laugh at myself, in perceiving what a lively inte∣rest I, who have renounced love on my own ac∣count, am still ready to take in the loves of my acquaintance. I am, I think, like an unlucky gamester, who, having narrowly escaped the ut∣ter wreck of his fortune, and having solemnly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never to touch a card again, yet loiters round the tables, and has an odd pleasure in peep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng into every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and that he can catch a sight of. Well, Heaven bless all the anxious adven∣tures, say I, in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me of chance, that I have declined for ever. You, my dear Har∣riot,
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
are like a lucky mortal at commerce, who has triumphantly cried, "Content;" perfectly secure that no one can exhibit a richer hand. The contemplative Edmund says, that in every numerous family there should be one maiden aunt, and one batchelor uncle, to buy toys for the children, and to lecture the parents. We are both steady in our purpose to fill these hum∣ble, but useful and quiet departments of life, and to remain, as the great philosopher whom I have just named expresses it, in a wise and armed neutrality, between the joys and afflictions that are continually treading on the heels of each other both in love and wedlock—Adieu.</P>

<P>YOU are a charming good creature, my dear Lucy, to relieve us so soon, and so effec∣tually, from our apprehensions. You have made us laugh at our own moral panic, as I may call it, concerning the continence of Edmund. You have made us weep at the very bitter affliction of your interesting Giuliana; and you have made us laugh again by the pleasantry of your sage re∣flections
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
upon single blessedness. You may talk as you please of your wise intentions; but I hope destiny has more benevolence to man, than to have devoted such a delightful creature as my dear correspondent to a life of celibacy. You have, indeed, had a narrow escape, after much agitation of the heart, from matrimonial misery, with a partner who shewed himself in a fortunate, though painful moment, unworthy of the bless∣ing that in the blindness of our deluded affection we all wished him to possess. You felt, and you supported, the disappointment in a manner that has rendered you inexpressibly dear to all who have the happiness of your friendship; and I trust it will be your lot to receive a richer reward in the love of some happier man, as perfectly de∣serving of you as the wretch I allude to was un∣worthy. Deuce take the artful fellow! I hate to think of him; yet the remembrance of all his base deceptions will often creep over my mind, like a chilling mist with a damp easterly wind. There is certainly much more true heroism in your soul, my dear Lucy, than in mine; though my good man often pays me compliments on my fortitude, I could not have passed through such scenes as you have had to sustain, with half your spirit, or half your good sense. I rejoice to find that you still retain the natural tender gaiety of your heart, and form to yourself an agreeable amusement in contemplating the affections of your acquaintance.</P>
<P>I am most willing to impart to you the intelli∣gence you request; yes, yes, I have made disco∣veries in the bosom of our Cornelia. Do not the
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
philosophers talk of little spots in the moon that they affirm to be burning volcanos! I can per∣ceive, without the aid of any marvellous glasses from that most obliging and polite man of deep science Mr. Herschell, a spot of this flaming na∣ture in that chaste luminary the heart of our lovely widow. Heavens! what a crimson cheek would she have, were she to peep over my shoul∣der, and peruse this saucy sentence! But 'tis even so; love is like murder, not to be conceal∣ed, however obstinately it may be denied. The dear dainty hypocrite is angry with me, when I tell her so; yet I could give you a thousand little unquestionable evidences in support of my charge; but I have only time to tell you one, that struck me yesterday: a gentleman happened to dine with us, who has passed the greater part of his life abroad. Cornelia engaged him in a conversation apart, and I accidentally discovered that Genoa had been a capital subject in their discourse: she had enquired if English travellers had ever been tempted to marry there by the fair natives of that opulent city: when I, jestingly, alluded to this enquiry, which she did not sup∣pose me to know, she blushed in such a violent degree, that as we were alone I could not help seizing her hand, and exclaiming, in a very odd sort of emotion, between a laugh and a cry, "Well, my dear, you shall have him, let him be Jew or Gentile." This led us into much se∣rious conversation, in which, with more frank∣ness than she had ever shewn upon this subject before, she confessed —Here, Lucy, I see you smile, in full and rogueish expectation of perus∣ing
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
the word Love; that, indeed, would have been a confession worth listening to; but not so fast, my dear girl, we are not yet arrived at that stage of the disorder; no, we confessed only, that of all the single men in the world this lively and generous traveller, Mr. Seymour, is the most agreeable in figure, in manners, in conver∣sation; but as to love, no: positively, seriously, and by all the unquestionable asseverations that ever passed the chaste lips of widowhood, we have not the slightest spark of that fiery passion in our frame: Mr. Seymour may pass his whole life in Italy, and we should feel no farther solici∣tude concerning him, than what every amiable mind must feel for the welfare of an accomplish∣ed young man, who engaged so readily in a rare and noble act of humanity. And so, my dear Lucy, so "we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." She means all that she says, for her honest lips have not the power of uttering even an equivocation, if her mind was capable of conspiring with her heart to meditate disguise. She believes herself perfectly from the soft infec∣tion. But if I know any thing of love, or hu∣man nature, she is actually fallen into the ma∣lady of poor D do; and as Virgil and Dryden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of that hapless Queen,

<P>Oh, pray order for us the collection of Giuli∣ana's songs; Love is an admirable music-master.

<P>AFTER a smooth, but rather a slow pas∣sage, we are at length in France! thank Heaven. You want not any description of French people, or French buildings; if you
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
did, I fear the accounts you would gain from me would be very unsatisfactory. I can see and hear nothing but my marvellously interesting fellow-traveller. What a divine creature she is! how admirable in her form and faculties! how ex∣quisite in her sensations! what efforts of heart and soul has it cost her to tear herself from the land that holds her buried lover! I can never forget her looks and gesture as she quitted our coast. The last thing she did on shore was to stoop and pick up a pebble, which she kissed de∣voutly, and then pressed into her bosom: a mil∣lion of words could not have expressed so much as she did by this little gesture. I believe I should have thought it fantastic in another wo∣man; but in Giuliana it appeared simple, grace∣ful and affecting, in the highest degree. What a rich fund of singular and entirely new de∣lights have you afforded me, my dear Edmund, by this commission! Had a prophet told me, two years ago, that I should at this time be tra∣velling with a young beauty, not connected with any living mortal; that I should hear, day after day, the softest language from the most lovely lips; that I should have every opportunity for the most tender familiarities, and yet that I should sit by the side of this fair creature with∣out thinking that she had such a thing as a lip belonging to her, without feeling a single inti∣mation from all the warm and wanton blood in my veins that I had a daughter of Eve within the reach of my embrace; had a prophet, I say, told me this, I should have laughed at him for a lying oracle, and have informed him, that his
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
prediction was not very consistent with general nature, and still less so with my constitution: yet this is truly the case. Giuliana seems to have realized the idea, in a charming song of Par∣nell's, to have been a woman to Peverell alone, and to be an angel to all the rest of mankind. I may, in truth, apply to her the expression of her darling Petrarch, and say, that her eyes seem to purify the air, and to banish every evil thought from her presence. You know I have long been fond of the Italian language; and I thought myself an intelligent admirer of Pe∣trarch, that insipid and wearisome sonneteer in the estimation of ordinary readers, that most exquisite and enchanting of all poets to every refined spirit under the immediate influence of sorrow or of love. But, though a tolerable pro∣ficient in his language, I really never felt the magic of Petrarch till I heard him recited by Gi∣uliana; and for this very high delight I am part∣ly indebted to accident. In drawing out her purse, at Canterbury, to bestow her charity on a venerable old mendicant, Giuliana let fall a most elegant diminutive copy of this celebrated poet: this, as she herself informed me, had been the constant pocket-companion of her dear Pe∣verell: the book, as if in sympathy with its master, had even received a wound from the horrid accident which occasioned his death; and his servant, the faithful Robert, thinking, very justly, that his tender-hearted mistress would prize it as a sacred invaluable relique, had beg∣ged, preserved, and presented it to her. I was highly pleased with this little anecdote; and par∣ticularly
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
happy to catch a subject for conversation that I knew to be in harmony with the feelings of my afflicted companion. I made Petrarch, therefore, the main topic of our discourse; I feigned myself puzzled by some passages, for the pleasure of leading Giuliana to amuse herself by a kind explanation of them. Heavens! if the soul of the poet was conscious of our con∣ference concerning him, what delight must he have received from the eloquent praise of his lovely commentator! When she found I had some relish for her darling author, she began to indulge herself in various quotations, so patheti∣cally apposite to her own condition, and deliver∣ed with such perfect eloquence, that I seemed never to have been acquainted either with true poetry, or true elocution, till that moment. I should fill a volume were I to enumerate and give you a full account of all these. Indeed you have a little specimen; but, without her voice, and with my translation, a most imperfect speci∣men of them, in <HI>her letter</HI> from Dover. I must however tell you one of her quotations, which struck me most forcibly; but let me first men∣tion the occasion that produced it. You know I join with you in detesting that cruel and ab∣surd maxim of endeavouring to console extreme sorrow by leading it from its object; grief is a noble imperious passion, that ought not to be thwarted, but to be flattered and indulged: on these principles, instead of avoiding the name of Peverell, I have frequently introduced it; and as we were within a few miles of Dover, in speaking of the personal attractions of Laura,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
I extolled in the warmest terms that rare portion of masculine grace and comeliness which that gallant young man was universally allowed to possess. I thought I saw in the features of Gi∣uliana that her impassioned heart swelled with a delightful, though melancholy pride, in hearing this honest praise of its idol; and in a moment she exclaimed,
<Q LANG="ita"><L>Discolorato hai morte il piu vel volto</L>
<L>Che mai si vide; e i piu begli occhi spenti</L>
<L>Spirto piu' acceso di virtuti ardenti</L>
<L>Del piu leggiadro, e piu vel nodo hai sciolto.</L>
<L>In un momento ogni mio ven mihai tolto.</L></Q></P>
<Q LANG="eng">[Oh Death, thou hast discoloured the most beautiful countenance, and extinguished the brightest eyes! thou hast loosed from the most graceful of mortal bonds a spirit most animated by every ardent virtue. In a moment thou hast robbed me of all my treasure.]</Q>
<P>Would to heaven I were a poet, that I might give you a juster idea of these enchanting num∣bers! yet, even then, I could not convey to you the inimitable gesture and heart-searching tone of Giuliana; these were so exquisitely pathetic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this occasion, that I was never half so much affected by the deepest tragedy as by her recita∣tion of these few verses. My tears, I believe, would have continued flowing till we entered Dover, had not my affection been called to a little auditor who felt the pathos of this passage still more intensely than I did: you will imme∣diately see this could be no other than the poor
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
faithful Giannina, whom you seated on the stool at our feet. I soon perceived her little rosy face was grown as pale as death itself; and I verily believe the girl would have fainted, or fallen in∣to convulsions, if I had not jumped from the chaise, and carried her in my arms for a few paces in the cool air. Giuliana, who is, you know, all tenderness to this little orphan, soon completed her recovery, by the sweetness of her maternal solicitude for the affectionate sufferer. But let me return to Petrarch: As we are such idolaters of the poet, we have agreed to visit Vaucluse on our journey, and I shall not write to you again till we have paid our devotions there. I conjure you and Lucy to sit down and begin learning Italian together; you know not what delight you have lost, by not being able to converse with our lovely friend in her own sweet languge. Thank Heaven, my Cornelia both speaks and sings it. My Cornelia, do I say? alas! if she is destined not to be so! Do you know, that Giuliana, who has, I fancy, received some hints from Lucy, begins to preach to me, like an angel as she is, on my impetuous character, and the danger of the passions! I am impetuous, I confess, yet not unreasonable in my wishes. Oh Heaven! let me be but as ar∣dently beloved by Cornelia as Peverell still is by Giuliana, and I will ask no more! Adieu. My engaging fellow-traveller intreated me to say every thing that is kind for her. While I have been writing, she and Giannina have been try∣ing to sleep off the unpleasant effects of their
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
sea-sickness. They are now much restored. Once more adieu; and let me repeat my request, and consign you to your Italian Grammar, that you may read the future letters of Giuliana with full pleasure. She will write to you, she says, as long as she exists; and if you do not acquire her language, you may oblige her perhaps, hereafter, to have her thoughts and words man∣gled by some translator still worse than your af∣fectionate, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AS I knew I should find opportunities of send∣ing our kind remembrances to you by your intimate friend, and most punctual correspon∣dent, at Paris, I intended not to write to you again till we had reached Avignon, and visited Vaucluse, the only object in our road that I thought likely to interest the curiosity, and af∣ford any thing like amusement, to my love∣ly grief devoted companion. But we have un∣expectly met with some adventures in our way, that not only drove Petrarch and Vaucluse from her mind, but almost made her forget even Peve∣rell
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
himself. In a word, my dear Edmund (but do not be alarmed, for the danger is all over), I have been at the point of death. I had reason indeed to call Giuliana an angel; for I must have expired, had not this divine creature watched over me with an attention as indefati∣gable and incessant as ever was paid by a fond mother to her sick infant. We have now been eleven days in this commodious and charitable city: I ought, I am sure, to bestow upon it that honourable epithet, as I have received from its generous inhabitants, to whom even my name was unknown, various presents of such articles as they supposed might be of use and comfort to a stranger, whom sickness had overtaken on his travels. My disorder, I confess, has been the natural effect of my own imprudence; for at Moulines I did a very foolish thing: unknown to Giuliana, and trusting too much to a strong constitution, I contracted a villainous cold and fe∣ver, by passing the whole night in the open air, to gratify a nonsensical whim that I will explain to you hereafter. By slighting my complaint at first, I made it miserably serious. On my arri∣val here, I was obliged to keep my bed; and dur∣ing the first seven days Giuliana and her good little silent shadow Giannina were constantly in my chamber day and night. They have now (God bless them!) restored me to such a degree that we are to set forward again to-morrow, and in a mode of travelling that, instead of wearying me with the fatigue of a journey, will rather restore me by the most easy, pleasant, and re∣freshing exercise; for we are to descend the
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
Rhone in a large batteau, in which there is a cabbin; it will take our carriage on board, and we are to stop in this agreeable voyage for the purposes of dining and sleeping at the different towns that embellish the banks of the river: thus, they tell us, we shall be smoothly and gai∣ly wafted to Avignon; and in truth, though my fever is entirely gone, I am not yet fit for any sort of rapid or rough motion. Here is my best physician, nurse, and governess, Giuliana, looking at her submissive and grateful patient with her angelic black eyes, and commanding me to resign my pen; first, because my head is not very fit to guide it any longer; and se∣condly, because she is determined she says to add herself an English postscript to this epistle. She shall not, however, take the paper from me till I have told you, that instead of lamenting, I really bless my illness; because it has in its ter∣mination done more essential service to the wounded spirit of my lovely friend, than my broken health could possibly have rendered her. My recovery seems indeed to have given her new existence. O Benevolence! I was not before insensible to thy beauty or thy power; but I knew not till now thy healing efficacy over a heart, however bruised and torn, that is still able to feel thee in all thy purest excess! Giu∣liana, in saving, and securing to me, that life which was on the point of its departure from this suffering frame, has in great measure dispelled the oppressive cloud which hung so heavy on her celestial mind. Though it is a cordial to me to praise her to you as I ought, she will not allow
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
me to scribble a syllable more. So farewell. Be not at all alarmed for me; and depend on my writing again very soon.</P>

By the assistance of the good GOD, I have made him to live, when I thought he must die! Now, praised be Heaven, all the danger is over! These are joyful English words from the pen of your Giuliana.

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. FROM MISS AUDLEY TO MRS. AUDLEY. [with the preceding inclosed.]</HEAD>
<P>THANK you, my dear Harriot, for the very amusing peep you have given me in∣to to the bosom of our Cornelia. You have, in a
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
most lively manner, presented her whole heart to my eyes; and methinks such a view of a heart in love is like viewing a little lump of cheese through a microscope. I see all the poor Corne∣lia's doubts, fears, hopes, wishes, caprices, ar∣guments, surmises, phantasies, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. all huddled and hurried together in perpetual rotation, like a legion of mites, and forming as it were the very substance of her heart. I fancy all her honest and delicate hypocrisy, though it deceives herself, will never lead you to doubt on the real state of her affection: but if you wish to put the point to still farther proof, I shall enable you to do so, for I enclose what I think an infallible touchstone for that purpose. You have only to read to her the letter from Sey∣mour, which you will find in this; taking care however to omit a parenthesis of comfort just before you come to the words <Q>I have been at the point of death.</Q> If she is in truth so deeply in love with the engaging creature as we have reason to conjecture, you will see her turn as pale as I did in a moment you well remember, when you and I were first informed that a certain plausible deceiver, who had just boasted to us of his prosperous voyage, was utterly undone. I most heartily hope that the issue of your Corne∣lia's love may be more happy than mine—it may be more happy, and yet not so tranquil: for my own part, I now rest on the same maxim of a reasonable poet,
<Q>Aim not at joy, but rest content with ease.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89"/>Let me, however, in disclaiming joy, declare, that I mean only the joys of love: for as to those of friendship, which I am persuaded are infi∣nitely the more valuable, few mortals possess them in more abundance, and none can feel them in a higher degree than I do; particularly when I reflect, my dear Harriot, on all your kindness towards me; and assure you, with a love "passing the Love of MAN," that I am</P>

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> Edmund is well, but not a little anxious concerning the health of his friend. For my part, I am inclined to think this illness is pro∣vidential, and only destined to prevent his being licentiously enamoured of his lovely compa∣nion; of which I confess I had terrible appre∣hensions. What a charming creature she is! I was infinitely more affected by her little post∣script of odd English, than by all Seymour's ac∣count of his malady. Farewell. Pray tell me very soon how my touchstone operates on the tender widow. Methinks I am like an old che∣mist, who, having burnt his fingers, impaired his health, and then destroyed all his books in dudgeon, takes a sort of half-malicious and half-goodnatured pleasure in observing a chemical novice, who carelessly sports with the most sub∣tile corrosive, before he is perfectly and painfully apprized of its extreme power.</P>
<P>I intended you a larger pacquet; but as the contents of this are very interesting, and I have

<HEAD>LETTER XV. MRS. AUDLEY. [in answer to the preceding.]</HEAD>
<P>YOU are a skilful chemist indeed, my dear Lucy—an absolute conjuror; but pray send us no more of your corrosive touchstones, my dear; or when you do, be so kind as to give me, at the same time, a lesson of caution on the use of them.—Turn pale indeed! do you call this turning pale, to be half frightened out of sense and existence? Ah, poor Cornelia! verily thou art infected. But let me recover from my sympathy in her panic, and make a full confession to you, my dear full sister, in this little piece of inquisitorial iniquity, how very wickedly I managed it. Your pacquet travel∣ling by a private hand, found me alone in the morning. Cornelia had left me, to write let∣ters in her own room. Having perused both yours and Seymour's, I was seized with a pas∣sionate desire to make the most of your touch∣stone. I believe, my dear, all women have
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
a little white malice in their minds on such occasions. I instantly sealed the pacquet again very neatly, and told my own maid to bring it to me as just arrived, when she found that Cor∣nelia and I were sat down as usual to work toge∣ther in the favourite little dressing-room. This critical time soon arrived; and while we were discoursing on the travellers, a very frequent to∣pic with us, your kind pacquet was put again into my hand. Before I broke the seal, I ob∣served no small degree of solicitude in the coun∣tenance of my companion. I thought her eyes sparkled with pleasure on the sight of Seymour's hand. She entreated me to read his letter aloud. I obeyed your direction; and left out the pa∣renthesis that speaks of his recovery: and in slowly pronouncing the words <Q>at the point of death,</Q> I fixed a searching eye on the features of my friend; describe them to you I cannot— no language can do justice to their expression; I must therefore content myself with telling you my own varied sensations of the moment. When I caught the first glimpse of her face, as I had my own treacherous trick very strongly in my head, I was on the point of laughing at the appearance of its success; but the pallid hue of affectionate terror, and I may say agony, growing every instant more alarming in the countenance of Cornelia, who sat before me with the open but speechless lips of anxiety and expectation, my heart smote me, and rendered me unable to execute all the cruel design that I had formed against her; which was, to let her remain for some hours in an absolute persuasion
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
of Seymour's being still in great danger: this barbarity I could not support; I read the reviving parenthesis; but without an avowal that I ought to have read it before. She was a little comfort∣ed: but her sufferings were still severe enough to excite my compassion: she perceived that I pitied her, and it both softened and opened her heart towards me; for, on my saying, with an half-smile, "Ah, my dear Cornelia, can you still say, and think, that you do not love Seymour?" she burst into a flood of tears, and hiding her lovely face in my bosom, she said, in a heart-piercing murmur, "I do, my dearest friend, I do love him in my soul: but it is a folly and a crime, my dear Harriot, that you must not encourage, but help me to cure."</P>
<P>You, my dear Lucy, who know what a friend I am to all honest love, will readily guess the part I now took in our conversation. I said eve∣ry thing that the most friendly sympathy could suggest, to soothe and to fortify her over-scrupu∣lous and trembling heart. I said what I really think, that her affection, instead of being ei∣ther foolish or criminal, is the fair offspring, not only of nature, but of propriety and jus∣tice. The very delicate and respectful manner in which Seymour had sought her esteem, dur∣ing the life of the poor old querulous invalid, whom it was impossible for her to love; the trembling awe, and the fond anxiety, with which he ventured to force himself into her presence in this house; and all his behaviour here; furnished me with weighty arguments in his favour; and I pleaded his cause, I believe,
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
with all the warmth of a sister; for I almost feel that I love him with a sisterly affection my∣self. The poor fellow seemed to derive so much comfort from my little civility to him in his short visit here, when my good man and Cornelia were both inclined to look rather blank upon him, that he convinced me of the truth and force of his passion, by the excess of his timidity and embarrassment; for in the first hour or two be seemed as it were to cling to me, to give him courage, as a child does, in first entering a dark room with its nurse. As the rogue does not want either grace or decent confidence in his ge∣neral manners, his extreme sensibility on this occasion inclined me very much to befriend him. I did so when he was here; I have now done so in his absence; and if it should really prove a misfortune to Cornelia to love him, as the dear weeping trembler told me it certainly must, Hea∣ven forgive me for the sin I have incurred in fanning the flame of her bosom! Not that I think Seymour much indebted to the abilities or the zeal of his advocate, for the sway he has gained over this little submissive, though mur∣muring heart, we are talking of. I said indeed a good deal in his praise: but what of that? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad not the most eloquent of all eulogists spoke before me?—had not Love informed her, that in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, in figure, in fortune, and in mutual regard, Seymour and Cornelia are a couple un∣commonly well-paired: they are, indeed, so perfectly matched in these essential points, that it is hardly possible to see them together without wishing them united.—"Aye, but my sweet
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
Harriot, says the trembling conscientious Cor∣nelia, think of that tremendous article, Reli∣gion! Remember the dying advice of my kind and provident Sedley! No, let me die by a malady more painful and more lingering than his, rather than act in opposition to so just, so benevolent, a counsellor." My dear Cornelia, I admire your virtuous spirit—I am charmed with your resolution; but do not disquiet your gentle heart with these imaginary terrors; there may be no such obstacle as you suppose in your way to happiness.—"Nay, my good Harriot, why would you wish to flatter and delude me? Did not you yourself, the other day, in speaking of Seymour, allude to the universal opinion of his being an Infidel? You spoke indeed in jest—a barbarous jest—but you did not know how deeply you wounded this very foolish heart. Now I have laid open to you all its aching fibres, pray, my dear Harriot, drop a little oil upon them; and do not, I conjure you, do not ad∣minister to me any of those dangerous medicines, which, under the pretence of healing a wound, only inflame and render it incurable.—Indeed I must not think of Seymour—no, I never will think of him! I hope he will remain in Italy— I wish he may fall in love with Giuliana—'Tis very likely." Here a deep sigh; which made me exclaim, "Oh, you abominable lovely hy∣pocrite! you have not any such wish in your heart; and if you ever forced yourself to feel it for a moment, and heard of its being accom∣plished, it would still make you half-frantic. Come, come, my dear Cornelia, there is really
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
no occasion for any of these desperate insup∣portable wishes; wish him a good godly hus∣band to yourself, and try to make him so. Who, my dear, could mould the rough arrogant mind of man better than such a gentle angel as your∣self, when inspired by the best motives, both of heaven and earth, true piety and chaste affec∣tion? Do we not read in history, that most of the Gothic sovereigns in Europe were converted to Christianity by their wives? After all, my dear, though we have allowed ourselves to talk freely of Seymour's wanting devotion; yet surely he is not more deficient in that point than the general herd of young men who have been bred to his rank and fortune: they are all so en∣grossed by pleasure or ambition, that few can find time either to think or to hear of GOD. Indeed I believe the generality of men in all sta∣tions are little acquainted with devotional ideas, till towards the middle, or rather the latter stage of their life; when, being settled in a domestic circle, and seeing a new generation rise to suc∣ceed in their departments, they find it high time to reflect on a better world.</P>
<P>You know, my dear Cornelia, it was my sin∣gular good fortune to fall into the arms of a man whose amiable mind imbibed very early a deep sense of religion; but, as he has told me him∣self, he was indebted for this blessing to some remarkable incidents that happened to him in his youth, much more than to any instruction. Religious as he is, no man can be more indul∣gent to those who differ from himself, though his sense of the beneficial influence which reli∣gion
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
has had, and still has on his own happiness, makes him wish most cordiaally to see it more prevalent: his sentiments and discourse on the levity of others are never violent or intrusive. I know he most sincerely admires all the gene∣rous and all the agreeable qualities in Seymour; and I will venture to say, that no event in the world would give him more pleasure than one which he thinks by no means improbable, and which I confess myself inclined to reckon in the class of certainties: I mean, the event of our seeing the engaging Seymour every thing we can wish him; or, to use the devout and gallant language of chivalry, most perfect in his ho∣mage, both to God and his fair-one."</P>
<P>'Twas thus, my dear Lucy, that I ran on, in my affectionate harangue to comfort and enliven the dear troubled Cornelia. I had the satisfaction of seeing her sweet countenance more and more ferene, as I proceeded, till at last her face grow∣ing bright as the face of an angel, she pressed my hand, and exclaimed, in a transport from her fa∣vourite tragedy of Zara:
<Q>Were he but Christian, what could man be more!</Q></P>
<P>She uttered this line with such an air of fond and devout passion, and as she spoke the possibi∣lity, or rather the hope, of being holily united to the only man she has ever loved, gave such a rich and tender glow to her lovely features, that I never saw any woman look so <HI>gloriously beautiful,</HI> to use a strong expression of our admired Lady Wortley, as my dear comforted Cornelia looked in that moment, I believe I remained gazing at
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
her, in mute delight, for a minute, as the plea∣sant traveller I have just mentioned gazed on the fair Fatima at Adrianople: though the Turkish lady, I grant, was a more dazzling figure, from the splendid novelty of her dress, I am persuaded she was not equal in beauty to my incomparable friend; for, in the first place, I can never think that black eyes can equal the delicious tenderness of blue; secondly, the monotony of Turkish love can hardly permit the face of a sultana to express that sweet and rich combination of intel∣ligence, sentiment, and passion, which gave such inexpressible charms to the countenance of Cor∣nelia at the instant I am talking of. But this little digression on beauty, of which you know I am a great idolater, has detained me too much: I must hasten to tell you, that we remained not long on those transporting heights to which our spirits were suddenly carried. Cornelia soon fell from the pinacle of hope, and I gently descended from that of admiration. Our conference took a more sober turn, and closed with a discreet reso∣lution, not to enter into any warm arguments, either for or against the object of our debate; but to leave things as they now are to those two great settlers of human doubts and perplexities, time and chance. In the mean time you will readily believe, that our eagerness to be favoured with all the dispatches you receive from the tra∣vellers, is not in a way to be diminished. Ex∣clusive, indeed, of the interest Cornelia takes in his welfare, I am heartily concerned for Sey∣mour's illness; both on his own account, and that of his interesting charge. Heaven send us
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
an early and good account of them! As to your remark, my dear Lucy, concerning the chaste providential tendency of Seymour's illness, I most heartily hope that you may be in the right; but I confess it strikes me in the opposite point of view, though I would not tell Cornelia so for the world; and perhaps it is merely because I remember a whimsical speech, made by a curi∣ous old gentleman, who used to visit my father very often, and delighted to make us girls laugh by the oddity of his remarks upon love and ma∣trimony, his never-failing subjects of discourse. This said old gentleman once gave the following caution to my mother: "Madam," said he, with an arch and humorous solemnity of face, "permit me to advise you never to employ a young woman to attend a sick man, unless you wish to make a match between them; for I have always observed in these cases, that the first use which a convalescent makes of his reviving strength is, a grateful tender of it to his nurse; and the good girl is so delighted to see a sick man growing well again, that she has no heart to con∣tradict him."</P>
<P>There's a short story for you, as an epilogue to the long one. Heaven grant it may make you smile, without being any bad omen for Cornelia! Mercy on us! if any such things should happen, as the recollection of this nonsensical old proser has put into my head: Deuce take him! for starting up in my memory; but not a word more, for here comes Cornelia, with two maps in her hand, to shew me all the route of the tra∣vellers. Ah, poor stricken deer! Well I must
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
positively close with all our love to you both. Dear girl, send us some good news the first mo∣ment that you have it in your power: and re∣member, that my pacquets to you are as volumi∣nous as an old counsellor's opinion; so pray imitate the lawyers on your part, and be not sparing in reply. Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>From my Batteau on the Rhone.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALIVE! alive, my dear Edmund! Behold me floating down the Rhone, by the side of the lovely and now smiling Giuliana. Do not therefore let your kind apprehension suggest to you, that I may be crossing the Styx with old Charon: my present voyage is a thousand times better; for I was never more disposed in my life to relish the charms of this world. Every thing I see is beautiful, every thing I taste is delicious. If this is the usual effect of a recovery from sick∣ness, I would willingly be sick once a-year. There is one thing, however, that puzzles me to account for: as you are a profound speculator, and as you love to ruminate on the variety and oddity of human sensations, I propose to your
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
sage worship the following query for your solu¦tion: Why was I a good and faithful Platonist a month ago, when I was in the full vigour of health? and why, at this season, when I am lit∣tle more than half restored from a state of debi∣lity, why do I feel a desperate inclination to the philosophy of Epicurus? What strange creatures we are! It seems to me as if all our wit and stupidity, our wisdom and folly, our virtues and vices, depended on a few drops, more or less, of the red, white, and yellow fluids, that are per∣petually changing in these tragi-comical machines that we call human bodies. I am this moment a striking illustration of my theory. I seized a pen, all gaiety, to write you at least the begin∣ning of a gay epistle on board. The motion of the boat as I write has moved my bile, made me half squeamish; and behold my gaiety turned to a dull dissertation on the mechanism of man, of which, like many who have attempted to explain it, I know nothing. But this I know, that when the manly machine is out of tune, nothing can put it to soon into harmony as placing it within the influence of an enchanting female; so allow me to throw down the pen, and take a few turns on the short deck of our vessel with my sweet messmate Giuliana. I will finish this as soon as we land at the village where we mean to dine.</P>
<P>I am now on shore; but tossed at this moment in one of the most disquieting half-tempests of heart and mind that I ever experienced Alas! my dear Edmund, I have played the fool most abominably. I reproach myself, and, what is worse, I feel incessantly that I still more deserve
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
your reproaches. But that you may not, from these imperfect intimations, suppose my offences more flagrant than they have been, I will give you a very full and frank history of the extreme folly by which I have poisoned the pure delight that, in spite of sickness itself, I had enjoyed, till this luckless day, in the faithful discharge of my trust.</P>
<P>After a most pleasant and short day's voyage, the kind considerate Giuliana, thinking me more an invalid than I am, and desirous that I should avoid the evening air on the river, con∣trived for us to take a late dinner at a delightful village, where we are also to pass the night. Our hotel is a new and elegant little structure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilt after an English model with bow windows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommanding one of the most enchanting pros∣pects that the eye can behold. Our landlady has been particularly recommended to Giuliana <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Lyons, and not without reason, for she seems to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssess in very rare and happy proportions the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity of France, and the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tness of Holland. In high delight with this singular and most agreeable <HI>auberge,</HI> I and my lovely companion, after a cheerful dinner in one of its upper apart∣ments, were leaning together on the open bow-window that commands this delicious country, when chance, or the devil, call it which you will, presented a sight to me that in an instant s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t fire to all the reviving wanton blood in my veins; yet it was by no means a sight of licen∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous pleasure, but one that rather favoured of primeval innocence and the golden age. Out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndow commanded a very pretty cottage, with
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
a little vineyard and flower-garden. The happy master of this diminutive kingdom is, it seems, a Scotch Catholic, who, after passing a few years in the French service, settled here with a very beautiful fair-one of this country. Having a passion for gardening, and being still in the prime of life, he draws a most healthy and de∣lightful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubsistence from wine, fruit, and flowers, the prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of his little domain. The business of the vintage is all past for this year; but it seems this honest man has a sensible good-natured custom of rewarding his handsome wife, and sweet children, for their labours in that busy season, by saving for them, as a treat after their toil, a little portion of his most exquisite fruit. We happened to behold him in the instant of collecting and distributing this reserved treasure. Figure to yourself, my dear Edmund, a fine tall military florid fellow, stretching out his manly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rame at the top of a ladder, to reach some hunches of magnificent grapes, at the lofty ex∣tremities of a broken rock, part of which he had fashioned into a garden-wall. Observe towards the feet of the ladder a little golden-headed boy, like a cherubim, who has crept up four or five steps, and is bolding up the hollow of his hat; while his mother, a woman as comely, as luxu∣riant in beauty as Pomona herself, holds one side of the ladder, while two beautiful little girls (both older than the boy) seem to delight them∣selves in thinking that they support the other. Behold the happy father descending with a neat open basket, well filled, in his hand. His chil∣dren form a little circle around him; each re∣ceives
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
a luxuriant bunch of grapes; each smiles with content and transport at the allotted share. Thus far all is well: but the honest man having kissed each of his children, in distributing his presents, upon delivering the residue of the fruit and the basket to their smiling mother, throws his left arm around her, and gives her so hearty a kiss, a kiss so marvellously expressive of connu∣bial happiness, that an old hermit in seeing it must have longed for a wife. No words can tell you the kind of electric fire that it seemed to communicate to all my fibres. Giuliana moved from the window, under the pretence of helping herself to a glass of water. I could not forbear following her; and I exclaimed, "What a cou∣ple of simpletons are you and I, my dear Giuli∣ana! You are solicitous to save the soul of a fa∣ther who may not perhaps thank you for your intention; and I to gain the heart of a widow, who has, perhaps, already bestowed it on a more fortunate suitor. How much wiser would it be in both of us to settle together in this delicious country, and act the sweet scene that we have just beheld in a vineyard of our own!" In utter∣ing the last word, I imprinted an hasty kiss on her lips. I had never made the slightest advance towards touching them before, and her extreme surprize did not allow her either time or presence of mind sufficient to shrink from my caress: but if you wish to know how she looked on the occa∣sion, imagine to yourself, my dear Edmund; an Attic priestess, in the moment of seeing an altar which she had guarded with the devoutest fidelity prophaned by a barbarian. Indignant displea∣sure
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
lightened from her eyes; her whole coun∣tenance expressed the rebuke of an offended angel; and I believe she was on the point of uttering some words of great severity, but she checked herself, and remained silent a few mo∣ments. I fancy my appearance affected her; it must have been very singular; for the flame of wanton desire, which had, I confess, a momen∣tary existence in my bosom, had sunk in the smouldering vapour of vexation and remorse. The agitation of these opposite feelings had given such a tremulous weakness to my unbraced nerves, that I believe Giuliana soon beheld me rather as an object of pity than of terror. I ab∣solutely had not power to speak; and, after a short pause, Giuliana said with a plaintive gen∣tleness of voice and manner, a thousand times more affecting to me than any vehement acrimo∣nious reproof could have been, "This is very wrong and very unexpected in my generous guide! Do not, Seymour, do not so cruelly de∣stroy the sincere satisfaction I felt, in being the instrument, under God, of preserving your life!" Closing this tender reprimand with a look still more expressive of her own wounded feelings, she left the room, and I felt as if I had heard my good genius say, "You are become unworthy of my care, and I abandon you to a legion of in∣fernal tormentors." My heart indeed was full of such visitants: I traversed the room in vain to shake them off, my attempts were equally fruit∣less, whether I tried to reason, or to laugh myself out of my bitter vexation. Pho! nonsense! said Pride, to comfort me. After all, what is your
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
mighty crime? barely touching the lip of a very beautiful woman, with whom you were alone. Aye, but, says Conscience, you know there are certain situations in which a simple kiss may seem an outrage, as cruel as absolute violation▪ it is in these tender points where a delicate heart and mind are concerned,
<Q>That nothing is but thinking makes it so.</Q>
Whatever self-flattery can suggest in my defence, the troubled look of Giuliana, imprinted on my heart, refutes every syllable of my delusive advo∣cate. I find no relief but in the most perfect re∣pentance. When I had brought my mind into a tolerable calm, by penitent resolutions of making all the atonement in my power for having so un∣gratefully offended my divine companion, I sate down to give you this history. I am now jaded with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing. Giuliana is not returned to me; I feel, like a wretch as I am, that I hardly de∣serve to see her more; yet I must enquire where she is.— Death and distraction! I may not see her for these two hours; she is gone, with Gian∣nina and the hostess, Heaven knows whither. I deserve it all, but her absence is more torturing to me than either the looks or language of her displeasure. Some demon has surely had the conduct of this whole day: it was from a per∣verse incident of his contrivance that Giannina happened to have left us alone after dinner; for I have constantly made a point of treating the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more as a relation than a servant to Giuli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na, and of course we have had her perpetually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our presence till this unfortunate afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106"/>I am this instant interrupted by a message from an obliging English traveller, who is just setting off for Lyons, and has kindly offered to take charge of any little packet that I may wish to dispatch. I am much more inclined to commit this epistle to the flames, than to any conveyance whatever; yet, in recollecting that my last may have filled your affectionate heart with painful apprehensions for my life, I think it best to send you the speediest account I can of my reviving health, though I shew you at the same time that I hardly deserve to live. Indeed I shall hardly de∣sire a longer existence than may suffice for me to reconcile Giuliana and her father; for I feel that I have forfeited all claims, if I ever had any, to the love of that irreproachable angelic creature, whose very name my lips are now become un∣worthy to pronounce, Cornelia. How should I presume to call her <HI>my Cornelia,</HI> as I fondly used to do, when I reflect that <HI>she</HI> never faltered in the execution of long, irksome, and painful duties, for which she was often repaid, they say, by que∣rulous ingratitude; and that <HI>I</HI> (Heavens! what a contrast!) that I have villainously failed in one delicate and honourable du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, though I felt the faithful discharge of it not only free from pain, but absolute delight.

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. FROM MISS AUDLEY TO MRS. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE back to yourself, my dear Harriot, the fine title you bestowed on me. 'Tis you who are the real conjurer; you are the true prophetess. O man! man! inconstant abomi∣nable man! in sober truth now I could lamost weep to think that, in reply to your most de∣lightful history of Cornelia, I have a sorry anec∣dote to tell you of her too agreeable infidel, who seems to prove himself as unorthodox in the nice points of love and honour, as he is supposed to be in the essential article of Religion. Alas! how would the tremulous heart of our poor Cor∣nelia palpitate, if she knew what I have learnt this morning! that the wicked rogue has been wantonly kissing his lovely afflicted fellow-travel∣ler.
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
O Heavens! I hear you exclaim; but hush, hush, my dear Harriot; drop not a word, I conjure you, that may suggest such a torment∣ing idea to the tender widow. In truth, all this terrific affair was nothing but the idle frolic of a moment; and the rogue has made himself such a frank confession, and expressed so much sincere contrition for his offence, that we ought perhaps to be rather quieted than alarmed by the incident. Let us act therefore as true Charity does with greater sinners, and conclude that his past wick∣edness will only furnish him with a surer foun∣dation for his future virtue. You and I, my dear Harriot, may rest perhaps on this conclu∣sion; but it would not do for the disquieted Cor∣nelia. I know, by woeful experience, that ideas which act as an opiate on the moderate appre∣hensions of Friendship, may produce nothing but an increase of irritation on the wild and feverish terrors of Love. Pray observe what a wondrous philosopher I grow, in living so much with our dear speculative Edmund. Indeed, he kindly lets me into many mysteries, to which I should be otherwise an utter stranger; and the knowledge of them has no little influence in se∣curing that degree of content which I have hap∣pily recovered. There was a time, you may re∣member, when I wished to be a young man, of a good figure, and an independent fortune; sup∣posing, as I believe many misses suppose, that such a character sports in the world at his plea∣sure, as in a perfect paradise. I have now very different ideas of this being, once so envied; an opulent young man, of strong passions, acute
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
sensibility, and with no well-settled principles, such in short as they most of them are, such a character, I say, now strikes me as resembling the dancers that I have read of in some barbarous nation, who twist, torture, and wound them∣selves a thousand horrible ways, under the name of gaiety and diversion: it is true, indeed, as Rowe, has sweetly told us,
<Q><L>That man, the lawless libertine, may rove</L>
<L>Free and unquestion'd thro' the wilds of love.</L></Q></P>
<P>But what does he generally find in these rov∣ings, so delightful to a young and credulous fancy? what are his adventures in this alluring wild? Why, truly, at one thicket he encounters a tigress; in another he is slung by an adder; or, if he is one of the lucky mortals who meet with a milder destiny in this said variegated wild, still, in stooping to gather a primrose, it is ten to one but he pricks his fingers against an hedge∣hog. But what a simple chattering monkey am I myself, in thus running into a fantastic disser∣tation on libertines, when I only meant to assure you, in a few simple words, that you and your lovely friend may be perfectly easy concerning the health of our interesting travellers! I wish of all things to inclose to you Seymour's letter to Edmund; but the rigid philosopher says, No: adding with a kind of severity, "If Cornelia should accidentally catch a sight of the hand, and petition for a perusal of the letter, the sym∣pathetic Harriot has not fortitude enough to re∣fuse; nor could she, indeed, with any very good grace." You must allow there is some reason, as
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
well as good-nature, in this argument; so if your curiosity, my dear Harriot, teizes you a lit∣tle on this point, as I fear it will, I can only say, as Hamlet does to his dear Horatio,
<Q>O'ermaster it as you may.</Q></P>
<P>I ought, perhaps, to proceed like Hamlet; and bind you, by a solemn form of adjuration: so come, my dear, prepare yourself to take the oath I require; swear to me upon your fan (which is a lady's sword); swear, I say,
<Q><L>Not to make known what you have heard to night,</L>
<L>Nor, by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase;</L>
<L>Nor, by ambiguous giving out, denote,</L>
<L>That you know aught from me.</L></Q></P>
<P>I would not, for the world, be accidentally the instrument to wound your Cornelia; I most cor∣dially wish her happy, though I fear she has but little chance of being so: I know how dangerous it is to love a man for whom our esteem cannot keep pace with our affection. But away with these gloomy presages: Heaven bless her to the utmost of her fond expectation, and preserve me as I am, <Q>In maiden meditation fancy-free!</Q></P>
<P>A curious prayer this on my part, when I am just sallying forth to take captive the noble Gene∣ral who has lately settled in our neighbourhood! We are to dine with him to-day; I dressed very early on purpose (not to captivate him, my dear, but) to scribble to you, without the dread of scribbling, as you know I have sometimes done,
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
without thinking of my dress till the very mo∣ment the carriage was ordered. Among my late philosophical observations I have observed, there is nothing which the lordly creature man dislikes more than to be made to wait for a woman who has no means of repaying him for her delay.</P>
<P>Well, here is the dear lordly Edmund himself just come into my room, to tell me the chariot is at the door; and let me add, there is a new horse to it, which is so like a man, that he can∣not wait with patience, and is at this instant pawing up the new-laid gravel under his feet. Horse and man, be as impatient as ye please, I cannot lay down my pen till I have told my dear Harriot the saucy speech Edmund has just made to me; especially as he delivered it as a kind of maxim for the grand purpose of teaching a spin∣ster how to chuse a husband: "Come, Lucy, said my dear dictator, come, and set your cap at the General: the love of a young man is like a dram; if it does not intoxicate, it inflames and undermines the health; but the love of a man in middle life is like wine; it does not agitate the animal spirits too furiously, but only acts as an excellent stomachick." So you see, my dear Harrriot, if I take the General, it is nothing more than taking a glass of port by the advice of my physician. But, as you know I hate to fol∣low prescriptions, I trust you will see me like a wise invalid, recover all my natural gaiety, by prudently and resolutely abstaining from all cor∣dials whatever. From this scrawl I think you may conclude that I am growing as great a rattle as I used to be.—Mercy, the horse has begun to
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
rear! and if I stay another moment, the philo∣sophic Edmund will begin to swear; so GOD bless you! and believe me ever,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE offended angel has forgiven me. But I am not yet reconciled to myself. My transgression, indeed, admits of palliation—and it might have been infinitely greater. But what a sorry apology is this, my dear Edmund! Was not Adam, as they tell us, banished from Para∣dise for tasting the tree of knowledge; though he touched not the tree of life? I feel like Adam; I feel exiled from a mental Paradise, which I have basely forfeited, and can hope to enter no more: I may indeed describe the divine Giuliana as the Adam of Milton describes Heaven after his offence,
<Q>I saw her placable and mild.</Q>
And I may also say of myself, that I have
<Q><L>many days</L>
<L>Give me of grace, wherein I may repeat,</L>
<L>And one bad act with many deeds well done</L>
<L>May cover.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113"/>But I feel that these days of mine, like those of poor Adam after his fall, must be passed in a state very different from my forfeited felicity. Though Giuliana, who has seen me not only penitent, but half-ill again with chagrin and vexation, has treated me with great indulgence and kindness; yet I too plainly perceive it is not in her own power to recall those pure, those tender, those deliciously flattering sensations of sisterly love to∣wards me, which my folly has dispelled. I have heard those who drink more freely than we do, my dear Edmond, declare, that there is a cer∣tain pitch of pleasure as you approach towards intoxication, which gives you an idea of coelestial delight. I cannot say I have felt this to the ex∣quisite degree they describe in any convivial festivity; but I maintain there is something which answers their description in a certain pe∣riod of perfect friendship, with a modest, beau∣tiful, afflicted woman. In the chaste familiarity and entire confidence of Giuliana, there was an inexpressible charm, which approached nearer to angelic bliss than all the raptures of triumphant love; like a brutal idiot as I was, I have destroy∣ed this charm for ever; since, as I have told you already, it is not in the power of the lovely for∣giving angel herself to restore it. But I will cease to weary you with this fruitless lamentation, and tell you the progress of our journey.</P>
<P>After a most tranquil voyage, in which the three gentlest elements, water, earth, and air, seemed to smile upon us as if they vied with each other in a wish to please us, we arrived last night at Avignon. Our progress down the Rhone,
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
which is by no means so rapid as I expected to find it, would have proved indeed a perfect jaunt of pleasure, if our minds had been in harmony with the scene around us; but this was far from being the case: poor Giuliana was frequently ab∣sorbed in melancholy reveries; and as to myself, being neither sick nor well, nor happy nor wretched, my affections and my imagination, instead of doing what they ought to have done, instead of contributing to the proper and salutary exercise of each other, seemed to have sunk into a stupid and detestable lethargy together. I did not look indeed on this smiling face of nature with such malignant eyes as the devil cast upon Eden, for I had not vivacity enough in my frame to feel the passion of envy; but I stared with heavy, sour, and most uncomfortable apathy, upon a series of animated scenes, from which I had ex∣pected to catch a tender gaiety of heart, and sprightliness of fancy. As we drew near Avig∣non, I could not help observing to Giuliana, that we had both discovered somewhat of ungrateful insensibility to the extreme fineness of our wea∣ther, and prosperity of our voyage. She answer∣ed by a happy quotation of these charming words from Metastasio (which I hope you and your fair fellow student Lucy are by this time able to con∣strue),
<Q LANG="ita"><L>Secondo in guerra, o in pace</L>
<L>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vano il <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ostro cor</L>
<L>Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iano di color</L>
<L>Tutu gli oggetti,</L></Q></P>
<Q LANG="eng"><PB N="113" REF="115"/>[All objects change their colour, in propor∣tion as they find war or peace in our hearts.]</Q>
<P>This quotation applicable to both. I have al∣ready given you too long an account of my own feelings, the poor rickety children of Indisposi∣tion and Folly; two miserable parents! Those of Giuliana had a nobler pedigree; and deserve a more ample history.</P>
<P>The great satisfaction, I may say the transient delight, which her feeling spirit received from my recovery, was soon over-cast by many cloudy thoughts. She has endured much pain, not in∣deed from the recurring force of her former affliction; nor from that disquieting incident of the kiss, which my misty imagination has mag∣nified, perhaps, to a very foolish degree, in all that I have said to you upon it.—The divine Giuliana, has adopted a new and much deeper source of disquietude. Her benevolent and tender mind will interest itself in a point that I have weakly suffered to become the subject of her thoughts, though I did not mean that it should ever fall within her knowledge, or even within her sus∣picion. This sounds a little like the language of an Irishman; but a few words will make the bull, if it is one, intelligible.</P>
<P>You must know then, that during my fever at Lyons I had two days of delirium; in which they tell me I made some very curious remarks concerning the immaculate conception, and di∣verse articles in the birth, parentage, and edu∣cation, of a certain mysterious Personage, whom I should rather have supposed myself likely to mention in the words ascribed to the lively Are∣tine:
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
<HI>"Io no'l conosco"</HI>—I do not know him▪ This passed as delirious raving; so in truth it was: yet had I been in Spain, perhaps the good folks of the Inquisition might have kindly cured my fever by application of their salutary fire.</P>
<P>What escaped from me in my frenzy dwelt on the compassionate mind of Giuliana; at various times she discovered a half-repressed and half-in∣dulged inclination to search into my religious opinions. Though you know there is nothing in the world that I detest so much as hypocrisy, I resolved on this head to play the hypocrite with my lovely companion, on account of her tender afflicted spirits. I was pleased, however, to ob∣serve, that in her own remarks on various con∣vents that we have passed, she shewed herself perfectly purified from the nonsensical bigotry of her country. I find that Peverell had taken pecu∣liar pains to eradicate from her mind all the no∣tions of Catholic superstition; but at the same time he attached her most firmly to his own per∣suasion. With love for his assistant, what tenet might he not have stolen from her mind! what might he not have implanted on her tender heart! In conversing with her on these topics, I was so charmed with the strength and lustre of her na∣tural understanding, that I suffered my own na∣tive sincerity to triumph over my prudence. I talked to her as if I was talking to you; and as she had led me to speak of Hume, Bolingbroke, and Voltaire, expressed my wonder that such a triumvirate, uniting all the powers of reason, eloquence, and wit, had not banished a decaying superstition from every cultivated mind. But all
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
our debates on this subject have ended as I be∣lieve every conference is apt to do between a man and a woman who differ very widely on any in∣teresting theme. Arguments have no efficacy opposed to feelings. The man loses some por∣tion of his esteem for the intellects of the wo∣man; and the woman ceases to revere and to confide in the heart of the man. Do not sup∣pose, however, that, like most theological dis∣putants, we are become bitter enemies: no, never did you hear of two polemics so tender and benevolent to each other. Our disputes have indeed some vivacity, but not a particle of acrimonious malignity. You would have been much affected, had you heard the close of our last; when Giuliana, with that graceful energy of gesture so peculiar to herself, fell on one knee, and exclaimed, "O my dear Peverell, if I have loved, and continue to love thee, with a fidelity of affection agreeable to thy pure spirit, grant me, before I die, to behold this generous, but misguided young man, made as happy as thou wert upon earth in the knowledge of thy GOD!" The pathetic kindness of this little prayer pierced me to the soul. I kissed her hand, bathed it with a tear, and begged that we might drop the sub∣ject for ever.</P>
<P>So ended our conference last night in this an∣tient residence of the popes. Never did one of those keen sanctified sensualists labour to make a convert to their interest or their pleasure (which were the main points of their pursuit, you know, in this city), with a fervency of spirit equal to that of the dear devout Giuliana. And, zealous
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
as she is, I may give her the praise so rarely de∣served by any Religionists in truly saying, that her charity is still superior to her zeal.</P>
<P>Before we retired to our separate pillows, the good creature, supposing the state of my bodily and mental health equally unsound, made me promise to rest a couple of days in this city, be∣fore I suffer myself to be shaken over the rocky roads of Provence. As she withdrew to her chamber she said, "I will engage to amuse you to-morrow; and I shall lead you to make an atonement for some or your past offences at the tomb of Laura, which we shall find, they tell me, within a very short walk from this house." She said this to me in her own soft language, and with a sweetness of manner that no language in the world could perfectly describe; her features in the moment expressed a mixture of melancho∣ly and benevolent, that affected me in a marvel∣lous degree. And I uttered to myself, as I with∣drew from her to my own apartment,
<Q LANG="ita"><L>L'amour n'a rien de si tendre,</L>
<L>Ni l'amitié de si douce.</L></Q></P>
<Q LANG="eng">[Love has nothing so tender: Friendship no∣thing so sweet.]</Q>
<P>My angelic fellow-traveller having dismissed me to my own chamber with a fancy so full of gentle ideas, procured me a dream of happiness in a fortunate visionary marriage with Cornelia— that I am destined perhaps to see only in a dream. On rising this morning, I found the scene very dismally altered: not only the delights of my
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
vision were fled; but the elements, as if angry with us for our insensibility to their smiles, have begun to frown upon us in a manner very unex∣pected: an unseasonable and violent rain has been falling for several hours; and my good governess Giuliana, who is full of fears for me without any for herself, has insisted on my not venturing abroad; and thus given me an oppor∣tunity of scribbling to you a letter enormously long, and as dull as the weather. As to Giuliana, she has deserted me, and is sallied forth, under the protection of Robert and a very ample umbrella. She has promised not to visit the tomb of Laura without me; and I rather suspect, from a word she dropt at her departure, that she is gone to a bookseller's in quest of some favourite religious author, whom she wishes to make her coadjutor in the grand project of my conversion.— Heaven bless her!—I begin to grow restless at her long absence, and often turn an anxious eye from my paper to the street. Oh, there she is; I spy her from the window this instant on her return; and with a face of such joyous animation, that, in∣stead of having picked an old dusty theologian from an obscure shelf, I could almost believe she has conjured the soul of poor Peverell out of Paradise to attend her. What can this mean? But joy is ever welcome; and especially when it approaches in a form of such tenderness and beauty. — Here she is——</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Edmund, and no less dear Lucy, how kind, how considerate, how unlike the con∣duct of common friends, and worthy of your own quick and benevolent spirits, was your for∣tunate
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
idea of dispatching a pacquet so delightful, with a chance of catching us on our road! Your obliging friends, the two lively brothers, who are galloping towards Rome, luckily drove into Avignon, while the faithful Robert was waiting for his mistress at the door of the bookseller I have mentioned. My lord's valet happened to be an old acquaintance of Robert's; and after shaking the honest fellow by the hand, informed him, that his master had letters for me. Robert in∣stantly imparted these glad tidings to Giuliana, who, wishing to have the delight of delivering the pacquet to me herself, desired to have it brought to her where she was. This most welcome, this transporting pacquet, is now in my hands; but before I reply to a line of it, I must exclaim, like some happy being whose name I have forgot: "Heaven, I had a soul to endure pain; now give me one to support delight!" I believe, in∣deed, that the good Giuliana thought me sinking into a new sort of delirium, when she beheld me kissing in an ecstacy that enchanting morsel of paper on which the blessed hand of Lucy assures me, "that, if Cornelia has a par∣tiality for any man on earth, it is unquestionably for me;" and then bids me "deserve her."— Deserve her! O ye powers who preside over love and felicity, what would I not do to deserve her!</P>
<Q><L>By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap</L>
<L>To pluck bright Honour from the pale-fac'd moon.</L></Q>
<P>Aye, verily, my dear Edmund, I would do more for Love than the noble Hotspur could me∣ditate
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
for honour.—But here comes my divine monitor, to moderate my rapture. I have scrib∣bled these few hasty expressions of joy and grati∣tude, while Giuliana has been adjusting her dress for our visit to the church of the Cordeliers. —Your charming and magical letter seems to have given serenity to the sky, as well as to our hearts; 'tis a delicious afternoon, and we are just sallying forth to pay our devotions at the grave of Laura.</P>
<Q><L>To see that buried dust of living fame,</L>
<L>Whose tomb fair Love and fairer Virtue kept.</L></Q>
<P>I shall still add to this voluminous letter before we leave Avignon; but I will not lay down the pen, even for a short pause, without assuring you, that the tender Giuliana takes a most friendly, I may say, lively interest, in those transports of hope which have so kindly awakened in my re-animated frame; and still more does she share with me in the sincere joy that I receive from these utterly unexpected, and therefore more de∣lightful assurances of your welfare, and your re∣gard for the two travellers, who both love you and your sister with all the warmth that friendship and gratitude can inspire.</P>
<P>We are now just preparing for our departure from this remarkable city; whose curiosities have entertained us beyond my expectation: but it is to you, my dear friends, distant as ye are, that we are indebted even for this entertainment; for, had not your enchanting letter put us into tune, I should have continued to stare at the objects that
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
solicited my notice with all the speen of Smel fungus. What curious machines we are!—the human heart appears to me like a clock, good for nothing unless frequently wound up by the hand of affection: you have now converted mine into a fine time-piece of ornamental and lively me∣chanism, in which a multitude of the most chear∣ful little images are at work together, by means of that mighty spring which you have so happily put in motion.</P>
<P>I wish I may reward you by accomplishing every thing you wish with the father of Giuliana.—I think I shall; and ground my hopes on some par∣ticular lines in his character, which I have col∣lected from her, and will tell you hereafter. I must now hastily close these voluminous dispatches; but not without telling you how ardently we wished that you and Lucy could have shared the pensive delight we enjoyed at the tomb of Laura. We were fortunate, however, in our attendant, hav∣ing met with the most polite and intelligent priest that ever fell in my way. He was enchanted with Giuliana, who, inspired by the scene, re∣peated some passages of Petrarch with a grace and pathos of magical, that I expected to see the shade so Laura expressing her satisfaction in these pleasing honours. Giuliana will not allow the sonnet to be genuine which was found in the tomb, and which our books of travels exhibit to you as copied from the hand-writing of Petrarch. —Apropos of poets: the polite Cordelier I have just mentioned, observing our passion for poetry, and hearing that we were to travel acrose Provence, has kindly recommended to my perusal a Latin
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
poetical epistle of the famous Chancellor de l'Hopital, describing the country we are to pass. Giuliana's bookseller has furnished me with a copy of this most respectable poet; I was before only acquainted with his political integrity. If I find his verses equal to the praise with which the friendly Cordelier recommended them to me, you shall hear more of them in my next: I can now only add, that Giuliana and I bestow on you, and the dear compassionate Lucy, our most cordial benedictions.—Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. CORNELIA TO MRS. AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! my very dear, and too penetrating Harriot, how much better do you under∣stand your poor confused Cornelia, than she un∣derstands, herself! How perfectly verified do I now find the words which you spoke to me with such tender raillery in pressing me to remain lon∣ger under your friendly roof: when you told me, than tearing my troubled heart from the comfort of your sympathetic conversation, to fortify it in the solitude of my own dreary mansion, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking a child out of leading-strings, before it had strength to go alone! A child indeed, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>et confidante! a very weak child, I confess!
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
and as unfit, I perceive, to be left alone as any infant of the nursery! Why do they tell us, that "solitude is the nurse of sense." It maybe so perhaps with man—but with woman, I fear, it is only the nurse of folly, and the cherisher of passion. At least, my dear Harriot, I will ho∣nestly confess to you, that it proves so with your weak Cornelia.—What different hopes had I conceived! What a sage heroine did I fancy myself, in accomplishing my painful resolution of quitting the daily converse of that beloved friend, whose too tender indulgence to my dan∣gerous prepossession I conceived to be a delicious poison to my quiet; if not to my integrity! In the delusive pride of good intention, I expected that the scenery here would restore me to peace; as I knew that every object around me would set the poor departed Sedley most forcibly before my eyes. I hoped to grow strong in the contem∣plation of his virtue; and to impress still deeper on my heart the kind religious admonition, which his dying tenderness bestowed on me. I am very far from feeling none of the impressions which I expected this habitation to make upon my mind. In some moments perhaps, I feel such impressions too strongly, like a person whose fits of feverish strength are succeeded by a proportionate weakness. You have entreated me to give you a very full and frank account of all my sensations; and surely you, who have taken such generous pains to tranquillize my bo∣som, have an unquestionable right to enquire into all its emotions. But do not tell me, dear Harriot, that I delight in very iniquitous self-accusation,
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
when I say, that I am sometimes too seraphic, and sometimes infinitely too like the weakest of mortals. When I set my foot in the library of poor Sedley, which is just as he left it, every volume seems to speak to me of its buried master; and the piercing eyes of his por∣trait, over the chimney, search my very soul; banish from me, as long as I behold them, every perilous propensity; and inspite me with a vain wish for the faculty of proving both a mother and a father to the dear boys he has left me.— I want not, indeed, any monitor to quicken the energy of my maternal feelings. My sweet lit∣tle ones engross and amuse the greater part of my day. But there are hours, you know, my dear Harriot, in which our children cease to be our companions. When I have resigned my two lovely boys to their early rest, and read William to sleep, which he generally wheedles me to do, I have still some pensive hours to myself; and those very hours, perhaps, in which a tender heart is most inclined to indulge itself in foolish tenderness. As I am passionately fond, you know, of a contemplative walk at the close of day, I frequently take a late ramble alone to that side of the park from whence I can cast an eye of pious meditation upon the grave of my poor Sedley.—The spot never fails to draw me into a very soothing religious reverie; and at these times, indeed, "I am in Heaven with him." But, alas! my Harriot, in proportion as I ad∣vance in my return to the house, my celestial thoughts fade away, and a living image steals upon my mind—the bewitching figure of the too

agreeable Seymour haunts me with more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ostly importunity. He tells me, with that tender but respectful insinuation which baffles all resistance, in our visionary intercourse, "that, instead of being such a dangerous cha∣racter as my dear dying monitor wished me to avoid, he is exactly the reverse; the very pro∣tector that Sedley wished me to acquire: full of the most disinterested love to me, and of the fondest affection to my promising little or∣phans." —Ah! my dear Harriot, this visionary intruder on my quiet has learned to plead his cause with all your fascinating arguments; but even these must not avail him; for, O my dearest Harriot, excellent creature as you are, in this one point, alas! I feel that Heaven is against you:
<Q>Though rebel Nature holds out half my heart.</Q></P>
<P>What a weak simpleton I am to continue talk∣ing thus incessantly of a man, whom I have pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sed myself not to think of! Why, indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uld I think of him in any light, to awaken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes or fears? There is little chance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing an object of peril to me, since I am se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ured by the very circumstances which poor Eloisa prays for in the anguish of her devout ap∣prehension. There are, Heaven knows, at pre∣sent barriers enough between me and this soul-terrifying Seymour; as I may now perhaps say, with literal truth,
<Q>Alps rise between us, and whole oceans roll.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127"/>Alas! who knows if he may ever repass the mountains and the seas that divide us! He has already, we know, been once at the point of death, in his travels; should he have a relapse on his journey, we shall have little chance in∣deed of ever beholding him again; and this ac∣complished, this enchanting Seymour, whom I sometimes wildly consider as a character of ter∣rific impiety, may lose perhaps his generous life in an act of the truest Christian charity that ever noble youth was engaged in. Ah, my dear Harriot, my foolish eyes are filled with tears. at this idea! yet my reason tells me there is ano∣ther event much more probable, and my folly tells me that the pain I should feel——But as you, my dear confessor, know all the sugges∣tions of my folly, even before I discover them myself, I will add no more on this subject. I have sufficiently complied with your request, and given you, in the preceding pages of my letter, an internal view of my heart, and the various sensations that have shaken it on my return to this place. Let me entreat you to take no ad∣vantage of the weakness I have so honestly ex∣posed to you. But let us faithfully adhere to the agreement we made in our last conference on this perpetual topic; let us abstain from all arguments on both sides of the question, and leave my future destiny to time and chance. To assume a little honest pride, and convince you that your weak Cornelia is not quite so far gone in this desperate malady of the heart as my dear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n pathetic Harriot supposes, I will shew you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I can scribble many pages to you upon other

subjects. Before I dispatch this pacquet by the rustic courier, who, to avoid the long circuit and delay of the post, is to pass regularly every fortnight by the short private road between us, I will endeavour to amuse you with two incidents of a very different nature, that have happened since my return.</P>
<P>The first is a little rural adventure, that af∣fected me very much. As your sister Lucy has often talked of amusing us with a novel of her own composition, pray tell her, that I think her lively genius might raise an admirable little pocket volume from the singular story I am going to tell you. As I have not the talents of our dear Lucy for embellishment, I must content myself with giving you the simple matter of fact.</P>
<P>You know that the humane disposition of poor Sedley made him, not only the friend, but the physician of the poor; and during hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long illness I have been used to act as his deputy in that character. As I was taking an afternoon walk with the children and their maid, near the private door of the park, that open on the little common, I saw a lad running with great violence towards us, and opened the door, to enquire into the cause of his agitation. As soon as he could collect sufficient breath he informed me, that the maid at the farm, which you see from the gate I have mentioned, was fallen into ter∣rible fits, and he was bid to run as fast as he could to the Great House for <HI>Madam's advice.</HI> I was very ready to obey the summons; and sending Nanny home with the children, I order∣ed
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
her to dispatch the grave and experienced Philip after me, with some pungent restoratives. A walk of little more than half a mile brought me to the beautiful poor excruciated patient. I wish I had the talent of description, to give you a perfect image of the scene that now presented itself to my attention. Figure to yourself, my dear Harriot, a fair, florid, robust, luxuriant beauty of nineteen, under the horrid influence of agonies that made her large distorted eyes roll like meteors, and her two even rows of strong white teeth grind each other with convulsive fe∣rocity: but I need not strive to paint for you a most distressing figure, of which you have al∣most a real portrait in your own house, from the pencil of Rubens. In the sublime sketch (which your good husband values so highly) of the Saint preparing to dispossess two Female Demoniacs, you have a very forcible representa∣tion of my unhappy patient at the moment I first beheld her. I should say, however, that she is a thousand times more beautiful than the youngest figure of Rubens, though her form has all that rich, muscular beauty in which he de∣lighted. The humanity of the farmer and his wife had placed the poor creature in their best chamber; but her contorsions were so violent, that four very strong men could hardly hold her down on the bed, and could not prevent her exposing to our view her whole bosom, which seemed to be distended and tortured with inter∣nal fire, though it retained the most snowy whiteness that I ever beheld in a human skin. You will think, her beauty must be great indeed,
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
when I tell you, the idea of it forced itself upon me in spite of all the torment under which I beheld it, and which I felt the most sincere anxiety to relieve. By various applications I had soon the delight of releasing her from these horrible convulsions. I then desired to be left alone with her, and, seating myself on the side of her bed, prepared to administer in soothing conversation a cordial to her heart, from whence I suspected this tremendous malady to have arisen. Ah! my dear Harriot, what a furious distemper is this pestilent Love! How can you be so cruel as to aim at persuading me to re∣sign my bosom to the dominion of such a De∣mon! All the terrific contorsions I have just described to you were in truth the sport of this tyrant. By expressing what I really felt, a great desire to be her friend, I drew from the good simple girl all the secrets of her agitated bosom. A young blacksmith, it seems, who has, I sup∣pose, no resemblance to Vulcan but in his trade, his obtained an absolute sway over the heart of this rustic Venus; and the immediate cause of her tremendous agony was nothing more than this petty circumstance. The barbarous Cyclops, as Lucy would call him, had been at a neigh∣bouring fair the preceding day, and had passed the abode of the damsel without bringing her a knot of remembrance, or calling to say a kind word to her, either as he went or as he returned. The sprightly Lucy, who thinks she has courage enough to whip the malicious little archer Cu∣pid with his own broken arrows, would, I be∣lieve, with her benevolent pleasantry, have ral∣lied
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
my simple patient out of her sufferings; and, by teaching her to laugh at her own fond∣ness, would have her, in a new fit of mirthful shame, hide her fine blushing face under the bedclothes. But I, who am as far as possible from possessing our dear Lucy's invaluable fa∣culty of laughing away pain either from myself or from another, I was obliged to pursue an op∣posite system for the relief of my interesting pa∣tient. Not having either the talent, or the dis∣position, to make her laugh with me, I indulg∣ed all my own weakness, and began, very sym∣pathetically, to weep with her; there was, in truth, such a natural and affecting simplicity in the poor girl's account of the anguish of heart she had endured, and of her ineffectual strug∣gle to suppress it, that I am almost inclined to think the gay Lucy herself would have wept at the recital. My sympathy was not without some good effect; by flattering the honest creature's pride, it seemed to give some energy to her mind, which had sunk under the complicated oppression <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grief, indignation, and despair.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to persuade her, that this cruel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was a mere accident; the young man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ht be engaged in business for his master, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at would not allow him to stop. "Hope the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, my good Jenny, said I; it is not likely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a man, who has given you such expectations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould desert so lovely and modest a girl as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e: I dare say, that by this time next year I shall not only have the pleasure of seeing you married, but I shall see you with a beautiful lit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tant in your arms." As I uttered these
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
chearing words an undescribable half-smile flash∣ed like lightning across the dark clouds of her expressive countenance. It was the momentary triumph of fond imagination over settled sadness of heart.</P>
<P>Being very desirous to prevent a return of her convulsions, and thinking that a visit from her lover would most effectually secure her from a relapse, I offered to send for him immediately: but the good girl, with a becoming pride, peti∣tioned against his being sent for; though I could easily perceive that her Soul panted for a sight of him. As the evening was now come, I pre∣pared to leave her, requesting that she would be as quiet, and endeavour to get as much sleep, as she could in the course of the night: and I promised to visit her soon in the morning. She expressed her obligations to me, with an humble, yet passionate gratitude, that affected me much; and the more, as I discerned an alarming degree of wild inquietude in her features. On my re∣turn home, I amused myself with the project of setting the troubled heart of this fair simple mai∣den at ease for life. I charged the discreet Phi∣lip to set out by day-break, and conduct this be∣loved blacksmith to me by my early breakfast-hour, without letting him know the private bu∣siness for which I wanted him. What a charm∣ing alacrity does any benevolent project give to the spirits! I had not waked any morning, since my return, with such comfortable and chearful sensations, as I felt in rising to prepare for the reception of the rustic stranger. My eager fancy delighted itself with a vision of the great happi∣ness
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
which I thought myself about to confer on two deserving creatures, who, though in an humble rank of life, possessed every thing that could render love a source of happiness to them∣selves, and an object of pleasing contemplation to their friends. I expected to see, in this for∣tunate son of Vulcan, a fine image of manly strength, and engaging simplicity, correspond∣ing to the feminine graces of his fair admirer. I waited his arrival with great impatience, and anticipated in my thoughts the pleasure I should have in seeing the burst of surprize, joy, and gratitude, in the varying features of a young, honest, open, rural countenance. At length the punctual Philip returned: but what was my astonishment, when he led into my apartment an ill-made, ugly, sallow, sour-looking fellow, more fashioned to convulse the heart of beauty with terror, than with love! Half my sympathe∣tic warm wishes for the marriage of poor Jenny, and, I am afraid, half my esteem for the good girl, died away at the first glance I cast on her grim-visaged swain. But when I recovered a little from my surprize, I began to hope that his understanding and his fidelity might make us some amends for the defects of his figure. I talked to him on his good fortune in being so sincerely beloved by a charming good girl, and asked if he had any plan of marrying her very soon. I wish, my dear Harriot, you could have beheld the half-farcical, half-tragic visage of the brute, when he replied in his rough dialect▪ <Q>No, madam, I be'nt such a fool. There be two wenches in our parish that I loves better
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
than she.</Q> I was now seriously mortified, for I lost all hope of accomplishing the little good that I had pleased myself with the prospect of doing: and I began to think the simple Jane had suffered herself to be sadly overcome by a very gross passion, for which the savage animal before me could furnish us with no decent apolo∣gy. But in this idea I did the poor girl much injustice; for a very singular and striking inci∣dent, that I shall relate to you presently, con∣vinced me that her passion had not only all the strength, but I may say all the chastity of ge∣nuine love. I resigned all my hopes, and indeed all my wishes, to form the match I intended! but I was still anxious to restore the health of the girl. I represented to her sullen swain, "that she had been very ill, and that I wished him to walk with me to see her, not for any matri∣monial purpose, but merely to comfort her spi∣rits, by the gentle civility of a friend." These were niceties of behaviour, that the surly Cy∣clops did not well comprehend; and he seemed to be alarmed, as if I had proposed to catch him in a net more subtile than his old master Vulcan is said to have contrived on a different occasion. I thought he would at last refuse to attend me; but while I was putting on my hat, Philip by ar∣gument, or by ale, put his terrors and his per∣versity to flight; and we set forth all together for the house of the damsel. I went first alone into her chamber, and found that she had been afflicted with a return of her fits after my de∣parture in the preceding evening. Her night had been restless; and all her features expressed
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
that she had suffered much, not only from the absence of sleep, but from inquietude of heart. I soon informed her, "that I had been so lucky as to meet with her friend Ned Hewson (for such is the name given by mortals to this grim son of Vulcan); and that, upon hearing she was not well, he had kindly come with me to enquire after her health." A sparkle of fond de∣light and gratitude now flashed from her eyes. She was still in bed; and on my asking her if I should bring Hewson into her chamber, she re∣plied, with a tender tremulous voice, <Q>Yes, if you please, Madam.</Q> I now expected to see the triumph of impassioned nature over mai∣denly, bashful reserve; I imagined that poor Jane would burst into a transport of tears, and clasp her grizly undeserving idol in her arms. Indeed I had some doubts if propriety would per∣mit me to stay, and gratify the curious wish, which I confess I felt very strongly to see the ef∣fect of their meeting. Thinking, however, that my medical character was a complete sancti∣on for me, I ventured to stay; and am very glad I did so, as I beheld a scene very different from my expectations, and one that restored to the good girl all that portion of my esteem which I told you she had lost in the course of my reflex∣ions on her amour. I called Hewson into her room, and as he approached her bed, she held out her hand to meet his with an air of very modest affection; then looking tenderly upon him, she replaced her head on the pillow, and, in the space of a minute, sunk into the pro∣found and sweet sleep of an infant. Nothing
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
could have surprised, nothing could have affected me more; all the language in the world could not so well have expressed to me how completely I had relieved her poor tortured bosom, by the new and singular opiate which I had so luckily brought. The very striking contrast between her present deep delicious repose, and her past wild agonies, and wakeful melancholy, led me into a train of reflection on that formidable pas∣sion, which has so extensive and so instantaneous a power to produce either a tempest or a calm in the human bosom. While I sate a considerable time gazing intensely on the sweet sleeping countenance of poor Jenny, my eyes were filled with tears of pity for her, and perhaps of ap∣prehension for myself. Love seems disposed to be a cruel enemy to us both, and there is in truth very little merit in all my anxious endea∣vours to be a friend to this hapless girl; for, as my favourite Zara says,
<Q><L>I, alas, myself have been a slave;</L>
<L>And when we pity woes which we have felt,</L>
<L>'Tis but a partial virtue.</L></Q></P>
<P>The cases, indeed, of poor Jenny and your Cornelia are not precisely the same; yet, I tear, we are both destined to be wretched, from un∣fortunate and unsubdued affection. But it is high time to quit this weak digression, and pro∣ceed in my story.</P>
<Q><L>Now then, with grief and shame, my Muse</L>
<L>The sequel of her tale pursues.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137"/>I had persuaded the half-humanized Ned Hew∣son to sit down, and wait with me the waking of my fascinated patient. When we had sat about half an hour, we heard a little tumult below stairs, and my companion was called down; as the noise did not break the sound slumber of Jenny, I sat quietly by her, without enquiring into the cause of the disturbance; but the far∣mer's wife soon brought me a surprising history of the tumultuous adventure: and what, think, you, was the source of the noisy contention below? Why, truly, it had proceeded from the marvellous attractions and the licentious gal∣lantry of my late companion, the hideous Ned Hewson: the parish officers had arrived in pur∣suit of him, and carried him off as their prisoner, and for what? No—not, as you suppose, to comfort and restore the credit of one poor preg∣nant weeper——but to make his election of two rival queens in that condition, who, alarmed, I suppose, by their swain's visit to me, and the rumour raised concerning it, had, in the same moment, and before the same magistrate, urged, with great vehemence, their equal claims to this tremendous, Alexander the Blacksmith.</P>
<P>But I am quite sick of this impudent ugly savage; and, as I dare say you will be so too, I will dispatch as briefly as I can the little residue of this long story. As I happened to want a laundry-maid, I prevailed on the farmer's, wife so let me take Jenny immediately in that capa∣city. I knew that a change of place would be the best plan to quiet that anguish of heart which I was convinced the good simple girl
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
would feel on the first hearing of an event, which I therefore wished to communicate to her myself with a preparatory sermon. When I had settled her in my own house, I informed her, that the perfidious Hewson, as a proper punish∣ment for his various infidelity, was just con∣demned to matrimonial bondage with a bustling vixen, who would most probably render his fu∣ture as turbulent as his past life has been licen∣tious.</P>
<Q>Some natural tears she dropt, but wip'd them soon.</Q>
<P>And although her features have still the traces of deep melancholy, I hope to restore her by de∣grees to content and chearfulness: though I know, alas! by experience, that when these blessings are once lost, they are not easily reco∣vered. Thus it is, both in high and low life—Love leads to folly, either bodily or mental; and folly ends in bitter disquietude, if not in lasting wretchedness. But your Cornelia is de∣termined, if possible, to grow wise. Pray en∣courage me in this sage resolution; and tell me, as I try perpetually to tell myself that the mo∣ther of two lovely heroic boys ought rather to think of playing the part of Minerva, than of a sighing Arcadian shepherdess; especially when I see, in the fate of poor Jenny, how a shepher∣dess is rewarded for her sighs. But I am now, in this sage humour, just going to take my even∣ing walk of meditation; adieu, therefore, for to-day, my dearest friend. To-morrow I will devote some early hour to what I have promised
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
you, a history of a different adventure, in which the tragi-comical confusion fell chiefly on your devoted Cornelia. It grows late; so, dearest friend of my bosom, good night!</P>
<P>And now, good morning to you, my dear Harriot; I have just assigned to my dear litle literary William his morning task, which is more a pleasure than a labour to him; and while my sweet Liliputian student is sitting quietly by my side, more compleatly absorbed in study than many sages of larger growth. I have resumed my pen, to tell you how ludicrou'sly, and yet how painfully, I have been put to the blush by my whimsical West-country cousin. Though you have often heard me mention his name, I do not believe that I ever gave you a description of this odd mortal, and his singular manners. If any human crea∣ture was ever born under a laughing planet, he is the man. The very contrast between his name and his figure is a perpetual incitement to laughter. Suppose yourself, my dear Harriot, a very grave and starched matron, seated in due form to receive my relation on his first visit, could you, do you think, preserve the gravity of your countenance on hearing your servant an∣nounce <HI>Mr. Small,</HI> and then beholding a huge gigantic mortal six feet high, and so immode∣rately corpulent, that he would split into a cou∣ple of your common theatrical Sir John Fal∣staffs? Add to this, that the comical creature, with almost as much real wit as Sir John, has
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
quite as much jocularity of gesture as an apt. His animal spirits are by no means inferior to his bulk, and you may suppose therefore that his gaiety, like his figure, borders on the mon∣strous; yet it is hardly possible to be angry with him, let his jests be ever so absurd or insulting. A serious insult he can never intend. Indeed, I believe it is as little in his power to be serious on any occasion, as it is to be diminutive. The very affections that give an air of melancholy to other men, have in this creature a very comic expression. I believe in my conscience, that, if he was reading the funeral service (the most solemn of all language) over a deceased friend that he loved, he would utter it in such a man∣ner, as to make you rather laugh than weep!</P>
<Q>And list the soul upon a jig to Heaven.</Q>
<P>With such an exterior of grotesque enormity, he has one or the most upright, benevolent, and tender hearts in the world; and really performs the actions of a Cato or Aristides with the fan∣tastic and rogueish grimaces of a Scaramouch.</P>
<P>This very strange being, whom I had not seen for three years, entered my dressing-room the other day, while William and I were read∣ing together by ourselves. I wish you could have seen the dear boy's look of astonishment, not so much at the first appearance of our gigantic cousin, as at his curious mode of saluting me, which William appeared to be in some doubt whether he should applaud or resent; indeed, it was not very clear, in the first moment, whe∣ther
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
his salutation was that of a friend or a foe. The giant caught me up in his arms exactly as you would take up a little girl of three years old; and first swinging me round, then gave me a kiss, and said, "I am come, my fair cou∣sin, to visit you for a few hours, just to brush away the cobwebs of solitude and sorrow from this pretty little head of yours." He then paid some fine compliments, between jest and earnest, to my understanding, and expressed his great joy at not finding me <HI>in weeds:</HI> "Your widow in weeds, cried he, is the silliest looking animal in the creation; she is like a young Armadillo— an Armadillo, cousin William, is a pig in ar∣mour, that hides every thing but his nose. Should not you laugh to see such a droll crea∣ture?"—"Can he fight so?" cried William, with eagerness and spirit. "No, my brave cousin, replied the Droll; and there lies the best part of my simile: the pig's armour, instead of proving a real defence, only invites the merry mischievous fellows, that catch sight of it, to try if they cannot drive a pin through it."— At this abominable rate he rattled on for about half an hour; sometimes making me laugh im∣moderately, and sometimes distressing me almost to tears. William, by degrees, became very familiar with him, and really made some very spirited and clever replies to his odd speeches. At last this half pleasing, half-provoking, and very ponderous jester, said to me, "Well, my sweet cousin, you must not think of moping alone in this noble place; it is high time you should have some such pretty little fairy-like
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
fellow as I am, beginning to dance about you like a Jack-o'-Lantern, to enliven the darkness of widowhood. What a pity it is that my dear, nervous, dainty wife did not take her flight to Paradise, as she threatened to do when I saw you last!" I should tell you, my dear Harri∣ot, with all this wild rhodomontade, he is pas∣sionately fond of his wife, who is indeed ner∣vous in the extreme, and perhaps not the less so for his making a perpetual joke of those fine lady-like appearances which her complaint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, more than her natural disposition of mind, have given to her character. The visible languor of her frame is very striking; yet, in spite of that languor, she has contrived to enliven this bois∣terous giant with a very numerous family; and some of its branches, he tells me, are grown a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> riotous and as noisy as himself. But I return from this digression, to the rattling discourse he was addressing to me. "What a charming match, cousin, you and I should have made in that case! Hey, my dear William, he continued, catching up the boy in his arms, should not you like such a dapper little play-fellow as I am, for your new papa?" William, when he reach∣ed the ground again, stared a moment, as if pondering on the question; and then said, with some drollery of manner, "I do not believe we have a bed in our house that is big enough to hold you." "Why, you ungracious rogue, said the giant, putting on a pretended sternness of countenance, who should you like better than me for a papa?" As my evil genius would have it, the little urchin, without being in the least
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
daunted by the feigned austerity of this demand, instantly replied, "Mr. Seymour."—Ah! my dear Harriot, you will easily guess what a coun∣tenance I had at the sound of that name, re∣peated by my arch cousin, with a most significant echo, and a whistle at the end of it, that seem∣ed like the view-halloo, which encreases the joy of the hunter, and the palpitation of poor Puss. I attempted, in an aukward, embarrassed man∣ner, to account for the child's partiality; but my gay vociferous relation soon interrupted me by saying, "Ah! my dear little widow, say no more!—say no more! I see clearly, by this crimson banner (patting my cheek) what a hap∣py conqueror is quartered in the castle of your heart—No! no! not a syllable of protesta∣tion!—Nay! my good little woman, do not look so seriously distressed!—Upon my soul, I am very glad it is so; I was afraid you might have been foolishly taught to think it proper to be solemn, and sober, and sad, for a century; which, in your situation, would be very non∣sensical."—By a deluge of words, half jocular, half tender, and all full of real benevolence, he utterly prevented my giving him a fair ex∣planation of my foolish embarrassment; and he is gone, in the full persuasion that I am passionately in love with Seymour, and determin∣ed to marry him. I am such a simpleton as to have been much flurried, and heartily vexed, by this incident, though I have such perfect confidence both in the honour and discretion of my rattling; cousin, that I am convinced he will not mention the idea he has conceived to any
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
living soul, except perhaps his wife, who is a good woman and no gossip. Still I am vexed; but I have tried to play the philosopher; and I make at least some use of my vexation, by giv∣ing you such a full history of it as may, I hope, contribute to your amusement. Pray tell Lucy, that observing how much her charming long let∣ters delighted you, I grew jealous of her, and determined to beat her by the length of my scrawls, though I cannot rival the brilliancy of her epistles. When I cast my eye on the size of this, it seems to have been written expressly to make you recant one of your favourite maxims, that a letter can never be too long from a person you love. I shall forgive you, therefore, my dearest Harriot, if you think me too prolix; but I shall not forgive you easily, if you do not observe, to my credit, how seldom the name of Seymour is repeated in these multitudinous pages, written, as they are, from a heart that delights to display itself to the invaluable bosom-friend of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX. FROM HENRY SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Antibes.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LET the sea, my dear Edmund, which smiles upon us here with a fair and inviting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, plead my excuse for sending you, once in my life, a very brief epistle. I may well claim the privilege of being laconic, after filling so many pages as I contrived to scribble to you, in the course of our slow but agreeable progress over the fragrant rocks of Provence. In perusing my two last pacquets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These two letter were lost.</P><P><HI>Note by the Editor.</HI></P></NOTE>, how will you, and my gentle lecturer Lucy, stare at each other, with looks of satisfactory surprize, to find me playing the new and solemn characters of critic and antiquarian by the side of my bewitching fellow traveller. But the <HI>felucca</HI> that I have engaged to transport us to Genoa is completely prepared for our re∣ception. This <HI>felucca,</HI> let me tell you, is such a stout, handsome, and commodious little vessel, that the timid Lucy herself would sail in it with∣out a fear. I question, however, if we are able to sail at all, for at present there is hardly a breath of air stirring; but we have a little sturdy
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
swarthy crew, (who look to me so ill-favoured that I could almost suppose them the identical galley. slaves described in Don Quixote) perfectly able and ready to brush the deep with their oars.— Adieu. Let us now embark, as I know we shall, with your ardent good wishes for the prosperity of our voyage. In proportion as the incomparable Giuliana draws nearer and nearer to the residence of her father, her feeling heart pal∣pitates with filial anxiety. I sympathise with her most cordially in these sensations; yet I cherish a comfortable persuasion, that I shall speedily gain a great influence over this curious old marble-hearted merchant. I have endeavoured to pene∣trate all the minutest peculiarities of his character, by the reports of his daughter: one point I am happily sure of, we shall run no hazard of differ∣ing on any religious ideas. This keen Italian, by passing several years of his early life in <HI>our coun∣try,</HI> contracted a most cordial contempt for the superstitions of <HI>his own</HI>; and he hates a priest, I find, as heartily as I do. As the energetic old humourist Johnson says, "I love a <HI>good hater</HI>;" and in my next I hope to send you a lively proof that, to hate the same objects, with reciprocal energy, is no bad introduction to a solid and useful friendship. I should be very prolix on this subject, were it not high time for us to get on board. Giuliana salute you both, as I do, from the bottom of an affectionate and grateful heart: I must add the name of my dear Cornelia, for the mere pleasure of writing it, having no time to speak even of her; and, if I had, what could I
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
say, that your friendship will not say for me?— Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Genoe.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>REJOICE, my dear Edmund, in the success of your ambassador. Again I say rejoice; for I am myself quite intoxicated with joy, while I inform you that your angelic Giuliana is restor∣ed to the root, to the bosom, of her reconciled, her transported father.</P>
<P>To moderate the pride of my present exulta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n, let me remember and declare, that I am not only indebted to your friendship for the honour of my mission, but I owe entirely to your excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the delight of its success. Yes, thou our philosopher, whose knowledge of nature, and whose cool judgment in the conduct of life is so infinitely superior to mine, I must frankly own to you, that if I had been destitute of your direc∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons for the management of this arduous busi∣ness, the native impetuosity of my temper would have utterly defeated all thebenevolent wishes of my heart, and the doors of the angry, the exas∣perated father, would have been closed, perhaps,
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
for ever against the most virtuous and most tender child that ever triumphed over paternal rage and resentment. In truth, I have had some fiery trials to endure; and, I flatter myself, you will applaud me for having sustained them, not only as your confidential friend, but as your affecti∣onate and obedient disciple. I fear I shall give you but a broken irregular narrative of those affecting scenes that I would wish to relate to you very circumstantially; for my nerves, which had not perfectly recovered from the shake they re∣ceived in my late illness, have been so variously convulsed in our recent adventures, that I do not seem to have one steady fibre in my frame; and, in the tumult of my present joy, though it is cer∣tainly a joy of the chastest kind, I am more ready to laugh and cry, by fits, like an hysterical wo∣man, than to sit down and commit to paper a long and methodical relation of those events which I am engaged, both by honour and incli∣nation, to tell you minutely.</P>
<P>Having collected my thoughts a little, and hav∣ing just received on the back of my right hand an inspiring kiss, accompanied by a tear, from Gi∣uliana, who is at this moment in a weeping tran∣sport of gratitude to you and to all of us, I will en∣deavour to accomplish my promise, and give you with the most exact fidelity all the agitating occur∣rences of our arrival and reception. Our voyage was pleasant, though not speedy; for we had so little wind, that we were obliged to make conti∣nual use of our oars. One of our laborious crew being disabled by sudden illness, I ventured to amuse myself by rowing in his place, though the
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
poor fellow resigned his oar very reluctantly, and would, I believe, have pulled to his last gasp if I had not insisted on relieving him, more for my own amusement than for his advantage. He told me truly, that I should find it much harder work than I supposed; but you know my passion for manly exercise of all kinds, and how apt my spirit is to give credit to my body for more strength than it has. The tender Giuliana remonstrated in vain, by kindly reminding me that my health was far from being confirmed. Man is an obsti∣nate animal, and he is never, I believe, more tempted to overstrain his force than when a lovely woman beseeches him to spare it. I sustained, however, the task I had imposed on myself, be∣yond the expectation of my companions; though, to confess the truth, I felt more exhausted than I would own to them. And I should not have re∣lated to you so trifling an incident, had it not produced a very singular and happy consequence at a future period, as you will see in due time; but, as my history is to be conducted with exact order, I have many things to tell you first.</P>
<P>As we had the advantage of very serene wea∣ther, and an early moon, I contrived, for vari∣ous reasons, not to land in Genoa till after the close of day. Our approach to the city, under the soft lustre of a clear and delicious evening, afforded me one of the most singular and en∣chanting views that I ever beheld: I could have paused for some hours, to survey the placid beauty of this semicircular port, and its rich crescent of stately palaces, with gardens on the roof of each, had not the heart of Giuliana presented to me a
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
much more engaging subject of contemplation. I am, you know, a passionate admirer of all pic∣turesque scenery; but it is not, I am persuaded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the power of nature to present any prospect to the eye so perfectly fascinating as the view of a lovely female heart under strong agitation.</P>
<P>Our present moonlight voyage very forcibly brought to my thought your moonlight visit with my companion to the tomb of Peverell. Giuliana was then under the recent impulse of distracted love and outrageous sorrow; yet I question if she could feel more at that time than she felt in the first moments of her return to her native city. Her anxious desire to regain the affection of her father, and to become the minister of his salvation, has given a tenderness and a fervor to her spirits beyond every thing that I ever saw in woman. In our passage from where we landed to the post-house, which is our inn, we had to pass the house of Seignor Pinelli. In crossing the door of her fa∣ther, as she hung upon my arm, I felt a shudder∣ing through her frame that affected me like an electric shock; having passed the door, she re∣vived at every step, like a person who has had the courage to cross an imaginary ghost. I looked back to see how it was with our little Giannina, who followed us close behind; and, affected as I was myself, I could not forbear laughing to ob∣serve the good simple girl, who was at that in∣stant before the door of the old Seignor, fortifying herself by the sign of the cross. Giannina, I be∣lieve, is not more of a Catholic than her mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress; yet so deep does superstition sink into an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fant mind, that in her present terror she had
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
recourse to a ceremony which she had probably determined to relinquish for ever. But I am dwel∣ling too long on petty circumstances. Behold us now safely arrived at our <HI>Osteria.</HI> I shut my fe∣males into a chamber together, to prevent their being discovered; and engaged my civil host in a private conversation, to collect from him all pos∣sible information concerning the old Seignor. He behaved, I find, on the elopement of his daughter, as Italians generally do under the in∣fluence of resentment, with a peculiar vehemence both of language and conduct. As fiery in his indignation as king Lear, he publicly
<Q><L>disclaim'd all his paternal care,</L>
<L>Propinquity and property of blood.</L></Q>
And being anxious to provide himself with heirs more worthy, in his idea, of the opulence he has to bequeath, "he is now (said my intelligent informer) on the point of marrying a young widow. Ah, Seignor, added my shrewd host, when angry old gentlemen endeavour to punish their young daughters for a little natural indiscre∣tion, they are very apt to play the fool them∣selves; and forget that they have not the plea of youth to excuse it." My host concluded with many compliments to my countrymen; and gave me to understand, that if he had himself a fine daughter, he should be proud to give her in mar∣riage to an English Cavalier, without any scru∣ples concerning her body or her soul. As soon as I escaped from my talkative landlord, I hastened to tell Giuliana the matrimonial news of her fa∣ther. She knows the widow perfectly; and said,
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
with great probability, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at if had been actu∣ally married to her he must have been completely wretched for life. But I am come, she added with a fervency or fillal and religious hope—I am come, I trust, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed hour, to save him, not only from eternal, but even from temporal infe∣licity." How sweet and innocent are these illu∣sions of affectionate piety! As far, however, as she projected wedding is concerned, it is proba∣ble there may be no illusion in the ardent hopes of our incomparable Giuliana. But I must not anticipate. Let me observe, if I can, the due order of time in the long and interesting history that I have undertaken to give you, with that mi∣nuteness to which you are so fully entitled, from all your generous attention to the excellent crea∣ture whose adventures and whose feelings you will expect me to describe.</P>
<P>We talked over various plans for gaining ad∣mittance to this offended father. I was half in∣clined to shorten the anxious and agonizing sus∣pense of Giuliana, by trusting entirely to the force of nature, and to the tender effect which the sight of a returning affectionate child, with∣out any preparation, might produce in a paren∣tal bosom. But, on mature reflexion, I chose to adhere very scrupulously to the conduct you had most kindly and very wisely prescribed to us. I went alone to the house of Seignor Pinelli, taking only a short billet of supplication from Giuliana, which she dated from England according to your advice; and I resolved, as you recommended, not to let the angry old man suspect that his daughter was returned to Genoa till I had some∣how
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
contrived to soften his resentment, and to alarm either his affection or his pride with the dread of such evils as might naturally overtake a desolate young woman in a foreign land.</P>
<P>As I had heard of his giving peremptory orders that no Englishman should be suffered to enter his doors, I thought of personating a French travel∣ler; but Giuliana assured me, I might safely trust to the kindness of her father's elderly and chief domestic, Pietro, for admission to a confer∣ence, if not with his master, at least with himself. She was perfectly right; the honest fellow wept like a parent, more than a servant, in perusing a scrap of paper with three lines, addressed to him, by the universally idolized Giuliana; but in shewing the tenderness of his own regard for her, he gave me a still stronger impression of the obsti∣nate anger which had raged without any remission in the fiery spirit of her father. He deplored, that, old and attached to her as he was from her infancy, he was not allowed even the privilege of naming his dear mistress in the presence of her exasperated parent. He spoke openly and warm∣ly of his master's new and unpromising matrimo∣nial prospect; and he expressed a wish, that amounted almost to a resolution, of pursuing the steps of the divine fugitive Giuliana, and dying in her service. He laboured to dissuade me from the attempt that he conceived to be very painful and fruitless, to melt the obdurate heart of Pinelli; but as soon as I acquainted him with the death of Peverell, his ideas were totally changed; his anxiety for the destitute Giuliana amounted to agony, and I believe the honest creature would
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
have introduced me to his master had he been sure of being stabbed the next moment for that act of disobedience. We both trembled, I believe, at the instant of that aweful ceremony; but, as soon as the good Pietro flung open the door of a magnificent library, I advanced with the firmest countenance I could, to salute the majestic and solitary merchant. He had been reading alone. Represent to yourself, my dear Edmund, a very noble figure, arrayed in black; in whose form and features I immediately discovered an engaging, though stern resemblance, to those of the beauti∣ful Giuliana; a figure exhibiting, to my appre∣hension, that simple dignity of character which we have frequently admired together in some quiet portraits of Titian; and had this figure been presented to us on canvass, we should, I think, have guessed it to be a person of eminence in a free republic. But this striking appearance of calm grandeur was the vision of a moment. The Seignor rose at my entrance, darting first a look of surprize upon me, and then of anger towards Pietro, who rapidly withdrew, to elude the order he expected for conducting me unheard from the apartment in which I had intruded.</P>
<P>I accosted the merchant, and stopped him be∣fore he had time to re-open his door. "I am come, Seignor," I exclaimed, "to announce to you the death of a man who has for some time been the object of your just indignation! —a very ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rible accident has put a sudden end to the life of Peverell; allow me to hope, that all your anger and all your unhappiness may be buried in his grave." The merchant stood motionless. His
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
pride seemed to contemplate in the event that I announced to him all his injuries avenged by the interposition of Heaven; but his native dignity restrained him from bursting into any indecent exultation. He surveyed me with a gloomy stern∣ness and features that expressed the unexpected gratification of a dark and imperious passion; but he thought it proper to lay, "The life or death of a distant ruffian are matters of no moment to me: I have only to forget, for my own peace, that such a villain ever existed." "With all my heart," I hastily replied: "let his existence be forgotten: he was no friend of mine. But surely, Seignor, neither you nor I can wish to forget that you have a most lovely daughter, who, though divided from you by the ocean, seems to exist only in your life; and expresses to you, in this letter, her fond filial wishes of being restored for ever to your parental bosom." I here presented to him the letter of Giuliana, which he eagerly seized, for no purpose but that of thrusting it into one of the candles by which he had been reading; and while the paper was blazing in his hand, he said to me, fiercely, "Let this convince you, young stranger, that I have no longer a child; and trouble me no more with vain petitions from a wanton ungrateful fugitive, against whom I have closed and fortified my heart for ever." This speech was uttered with such a stedfast appear∣ance of inflexible severity, that I was half petri∣fied at the sound of it; but rallying my dismayed spirits to the utmost of my power, I pursued my point in the following manner.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156"/>"You will not think it, Seignor, a very dif∣ficult point to free yourself from my intrusion, when I assure you, with the strictest truth, that I have no purpose to answer in my visit to you, but the purpose of pure humanity; that I am led to your house, only by compassion for your angelic unfortunate daughter, and by good will to your∣self." I now perceived that the old man began to listen to me with milder attention. I derived new spirit from that idea. I launched out into a full, perhaps a vain account, of my own station in life. I gave him a circumstantial narrative of the singular, the innocent, the magnanimous conduct, of his child. I spoke of you, my d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar Edmund; and you will believe I spoke of you with all the enthusiasm of friendship. In short, I spoke so long and so eagerly, that I found my strength fail on a sudden, and I was on the point of faint∣ing. The old man was affected; with great gent∣leness he placed me on a sopha, and called for refreshments. As I imputed my sudden languor to what I believe was its real cause, the fatigue I had foolishly drawn on myself by the incident of the oar, Pietro brought in some very fine fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, with cakes and cordial wine; and the honest fel∣low cast upon me such a look of solicitous enquiry, his keen countenance expressed such a mixture of concern for me, and of hope for his mistress, that, half dead as I was, I could hardly help ex∣claiming, "Honest Pietro, we shall triumph at last!" The merchant himself, with that sin∣gular union of dignity and tenderne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in his man∣ner which we have so much admired in his daugh∣ter, exerted himself assiduously for my relief, yet
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
without uttering a syllable that pointed towards a reconciliation with Giuliana. He observed, and I believe very truly, that a reclining posture had saved me from absolute fainting; and he be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged me not to attempt any further discourse till the rich wine, whose restorative influence he boasted, had recruited my exhausted frame. As the giddi∣ness of my head had been relieved by my position, I now felt myself as strong in mind as I was weak in body; and, as you know, my dear Edmund, how I love to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eize every opportunity of acting with a romantic spirit, you will not be surprized at my resolving to try the influence of this spirit on the dignified merchant. While I still reclined, and he st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od before me with a glass in his hand, strongly pressing me to swallow his never-sailing cordial, "Dear Seignor," I exclaimed, "is it possible that you, so charitable to a stranger, can s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut your heart against your own angelic daugh∣ter! It it is possible, let me rather expire, from fatigue and emptiness, in your presence, than owe my life to a being with a heart so unnatural!" In saying this with a trembling voice, I gently put aside the glass that he was presenting to me. The old man was half provoked and half softened by my odd behaviour. "I fear," said he, looking down upon me with a stern and penetrating glance, "you are an ungovernable young man, rashly wandering from your own parents, and losing your senses in a foolish passion for this unworthy girl" On hearing this surmise, I burst into a passionate protestation of my genuine and pure friendship for Giuliana. I avowed, without naming her, my real attachment and hopes of marriage
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
with Cornelia. To convince him of my truth, I offered to relinquish the immediate pretended object of my travels, which I had told him was to escort a sickly sister of mine to a relation we had in Italy; and begged that we might guide him to his daughter in England, and return again all together. The Seignor was greatly touched by the frankness of this proposal, and said, with an air of mild deliberation, "What∣ever your designs may be, you are a very extraor∣dinary and interesting visitor: if I have wronged you by my suspicions, I ask your pardon, and I entreat you no longer to reject the cordial for which you have such visible occasion." As he held one hand towards me with the wine, I seized the other, and kissing it, replied, "I have, in∣deed, my dear Seignor, occasion for your kind∣ness; but would you shew it most effectually for my relief, drink yourself the glass you offer me— drink it to the health and happy return of your child—I will pledge you with my whole soul, and, instead of declining your favours, will then bless you with tears of gratitude for your generous hos∣pitality." My tears, however, would not wait for this appointed moment; they gushed as I spoke, upon the hand of the merchant.</P>
<P>"There is no contending with you," said the half-melted father, and pouring out a second glass for me, he complied with my intreaty, by drink∣ing the first, yet he could not preva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l on his lips to utter the name of Giuliana, or to express even a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh for her return; he only said to me, in a sort of murmur, "May the penitent you plead for deserve so disinterested a friend!" "She
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
deserves the friendship of earth and heaven," said I, starting up in a transport of exultation at hav∣ing succeeded so far, and venting the fulness of my heart in the most fervent vow for the affecti∣onate re-union of a child and parent so worthy of each other, and so unhappily divided. I at last eagerly swallowed the <HI>Lacryma Christi</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A wine so called.</NOTE>, which my courteous host had so repeatedly recommend∣ed as the best of restoratives; my stomach, in∣deed, acknowledged the excellence of his cordial; but my heart and soul felt a still warmer and more delightful effect, from my prospect of bending him to my wishes. He filled my glass again, and, to animate me still farther, drank himself, in a very friendly manner, to my perfect recovery. His generous wine seemed to operate as happily towards opening his own heart, as it did in re∣lieving the languor of my frame: yet, observing how much he laboured to wave all discourse on his daughter; I thought it best for me to gain, if possible, some portion of his esteem, by talking on other topics, before I pressed him again on that point. I had studied the peculiarities of his character, and now endeavoured to turn them to my advantage. How adroit are we made by any passionate and benevolent desire! Of all talents in the world I have the least pretensions to the talent of flattery; yet I contrived to flatter the penetrating merchant very successfully, on his republican dignity, on the spirit of his ancestors, who defended his native city from the tyranny of France, on the native and improved vigour of his mind, in despising, not only the gross supersti∣tions of his country, but every species of supersti∣tion.
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
Here you know, my dear Edmund, I was galloping on my favourite ground: the sub∣ject, and the delightful end that I hoped to gain by introducing it, assisted by the potent wine I had drank, inspired me, I believe, with unusual eloquence; for the old merchant, while I kept clear of his daughter, appeared to sympathise with me in every sentiment. The more I talked to him, the more he seemed to covet my acquaint∣ance; and at last I flattered him into such a vein of good humour, that he insisted on my making his house my home while I stayed in Genoa. This offer was the great object of my ambition; and I thought myself a most capital politician in having obtained it; but, instead of replying to it by a profusion of thanks and scruples, I exclaimed, "No, my good Seignor, I must not trust myself with such an enchanting companion; for you have already made me forget, not only my own infirmities, but those of my poor sister, who is now waiting for me at your post-house; and if I stay any longer, the poor terrified girl will con∣clude that I have been robbed and murdered in your streets." In saying this, I prepared to take my leave for the night. The courteous Pinelli insisted on paying his respects to the lady, and conveying her from an house so unfit for a female invalid, to his own comfortable mansion. His carriage was ordered for this purpose. With some difficulty I prevailed on the polite old man to let me be his ambassador, on an absolute promise of returning to him, with my sister and all our ser∣vants, in the course of the evening. I was now in such an agitation of triumph, and impatience
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
to relieve the suspense of Giuliana, that I could not wait for the carriage; but, desiring that it might follow me, I flew to release my dear anxious prisoner, and bless her with the tidings of my suc∣cess. Her joy was great, but still tempered with apprehension, as I had too frankly told her all that honest Pietro said of her father's implacability. She was afraid that his quick spirit would catch fire on the discovery of deception, and that, in∣stead of giving us a cordial welcome as I presum∣ed, be would spurn us from his door. I was not, in deed, perfectly free from fear myself on this point; but I endeavoured to strengthen the hopes of Giu∣liana. "O, said the divine creature, all I mean is to prepare you with patience to endure calmly any sudden burst of his resentment: as to myself, it is my duty to suffer, and to embrace all the in∣dignities that can be put upon me; and what would I not most chearfully undergo to regain his affections, and to lead him by degrees to a wor∣thier sense of his God!" Such was the devout enthusiasm of this incomparable daughter. She had no fears for herself, but all for me and her fa∣ther, because she thought that in our tempers we are both precipitate, and equally destitute of re∣ligious regulation.</P>
<P>While she was giving me a divine lecture, her father's carriage arrived; her heart fluttered at the sound of it. Having muffled up both her face and Giannina's, with a charge not to discover themselves till they were at the feet of the vene∣rable Seignor, I thrust them hastily into the carri∣age, and we were rapidly driven to his door. Conceive the palpitation of our hearts, my dear
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
Edmund, at this moment. Honest Pietro let us in; and as both the females were effectually dis∣guised, by their English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bits, and the conceal∣ment of their faces, he marched before us with∣out any suspicion tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his dear mistress was so near him, to usher us into a saloon, where the Seig∣nor, with a little collation, was waiting to re∣ceive us. I stepped before the females, and said, "Forgive me, my dear Seignor, for presenting to you, under the name of my sister, the lost, but unsullied jewel of this house!"—Giuliana was now kneeling before him, and, seizing his hand in an agony of tenderness and terror, he stood, for an instant, firm, with an averted countenance. I never endured, in my life, an instant of such pain. But Nature soon declared herself our con∣federate: the old man had not power to persist in his proud indignation, and catching up his lovely suppliant child, he burst into tears, and pressed her to his bosom. I wept as plentifully, and had as little power of speaking; but my heart shouted, <HI>Victoria!</HI> and seizing the little Giannina in my arms, I ran off with her, to reward the good soul of Pietro, who was standing in a trance of awe∣ful amazement on the outer side of the half-open door. The honest old domestic was frantic with joy when I sportively threw the returned little fu∣gitive into his arms. After receiving a million of his rapid benedictions, I ventured to return to a scene still more interesting and more delightful, which I had quitted chiefly from a desire of paying the most delicate respect to the sanctity of paren∣tal emotions.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163"/>As soon as I appeared again in the presence of the relenting father, Giuliana quitted his hand, and advancing towards me with a chaste familia∣rity and tenderness, which you who know her, and you only, can perfectly conceive, she embraced me, and exclaimed, "My guide, my brother! O that our dear Edmund and Lucy were here, to share with us in the sensations of this blessed hour!—but they are present in you;" and em∣bracing me again, she added, "You will tell them how all their divine goodness to me is felt at this moment, not only by their grateful Giu∣liana, but her kind, her dear sympathetic father." She now put my hand into his; and the strongly affected old man attempted to express his obliga∣tion; but his heart was yet too full for words: he could only speak to me by a pressure of the hand; but what language could equal the ex∣pressive force of that pressure! My heart felt it in every fibre; and I declare to you, that I question if a touch of tenderness from the hand of my adored Cornelia herself could have given me more exquisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e delight.—Ah, my dear philosopher, you and I have hitherto been fools in our notions of pleasure; if we wish to experience the keenest and purest of all human delight, let us hasten to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athers. O Pinelli, how exquisite must be thy transport in this event, since the mere sight of it is to delicious to a stranger who has known thee but a day!</P>
<P>I have still a thousand things to tell you, dearest friends, though I may literally say I have been writing to you from

allowing very short pauses for necessary refresh∣ment. The good merchant very wisely put us a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l soon to bed last night: to day, therefore, I have dedicated entirely to the pen; not only from my extreme eagerness to impart to you, at full length, the glad tidings of our success, but from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of leaving my interesting host and his incompa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ble daughter as much as possible to themselves, that they might unburthen their full hearts to each other.</P>
<P>I have not yet had an opportunity of learning from Giuliana the particulars of their private con∣versation; yet I am very anxious to do so, as I have an unpleasant apprehension of this young widow who has entangled the old merchant: as we have so happily restored to him his angelic child, it would grieve my soul to have her future life poisoned by his completion of these unpromis∣ing nuptials.—</P>
<P>"Well, my dear governess, I obey; and will only add a few syllables more to the enormous pacquet." This is my obedient reply to a certain guardian angel, commonly called Giuliana, who has just told me, that I shall write myself dead if I do not desist a little from my labour. The Seignor also says, that my letter must be dispatch∣ed, to save the post; so, exhausted as I am, let me promise you another epistle in a very few days; and conclude with our united benedic∣tions.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. FROM MISS AUDLEY TO MRS. AUDLEY. [sent with the preceding letter from Seymour.]</HEAD>
<P>READ, read, and rejoice, my good Har∣riot! Thanks to the chaste stars! and double thanks to the virtue and kindness of our spirited and excellent young traveller! I am ena∣bled to make the very return I most wished to your friendly and delightful communication, in restoring to you that enchanting picture which our dear frank Cornelia has given you of her own feeling heart. How happy am I to join her interesting pages to pages not less interesting, from a hand that will now, I trust, in due time, be most happily and holily joined to hers.</P>
<P>How will her lovely quick eyes devour the his∣tory I send you! Methinks I see all her doubts, her terrors, her scruples, her resolutions, melt away as she advances in the perusal. Our bene∣volent Edmund is transported with the conduct and success of his young ambassador; and pro∣nounces him fairly entitled to paradise, from his various merits in this arduous trial: the paradise we mean is, the heart of your Cornelia; of which we call you the Saint Peter: we beseech you, therefore, fair saint, to throw open the
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
blessed gate over which you preside, and secure free admission to this meritorious aspirer.</P>
<P>In sober serious truth, my dear Harriot, we entreat you to make the most of the present glo∣rious opportunity, to strengthen the interest of this engaging Seymour; not only in the heart of Cornelia, where Love and Nature, I fancy will sufficiently befriend him, but in the less soft, though amiable mind, of your excellent hus∣band.</P>
<P>Ah, my dear Harriot, I cannot conceal from you the dread that torments me in the midst of our joy. Do not, with the usual weakness of a wife, betray me to my brother; to whose endea∣ring virtues be assured that my heart does full justice, while I tremble for the possible conse∣quence of his inflexible integrity: you will un∣derstand what I mean. Believe me, my dear sister, we have both of us a thousand reasons for the most tender caution on this very delicate point.</P>
<P>Should your husband now oppose the union of Seymour and Cornelia, from any motives of re∣ligious apprehension, farewell, not only to the future happiness of that interesting and deeply enamoured pair; but farewell to that sweet peace and harmonious affection which has long pre∣vailed, so uncommonly, and so delightfully, among the different branches of our house. I can perceive already, that all the boasted philo∣sophy, of our tranquil Edmund will not be suffi∣cient to prevent his pride from resenting any op∣position of the kind I have mentioned against the
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
young friend to whom his heart is now acknow∣ledging its recent and indelible obligation.</P>
<P>A word to the wise, though it comes from an affectionate simpleton, may be of some use; for∣give me, therefore, my dear Harriot, if there is folly, as I suspect there is, in the gloominess of my fears; and continue to love me for the warmth and sincerity of my affection.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. FROM MRS. AUDLEY; [in answer to the preceding.]</HEAD>
<P>FORGIVE you, my dear tender-hearted mo∣nitor! ask not forgiveness when you de∣serve the fondest thanks. I have reproached myself a thousand times for the idle words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dropt in our hasty interview, when I confided to you the charming pacquet of our Cornelia. Your benevolent spirit has, I find by the anxious kindness of your letter this moment received, dwelt very seriously on those idle words. After I ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you farewell, I was apprehensive that you might do so; your good-nature, which is natu∣rally alive and solicitous for your friends, has ac∣quired, from the singular incidents of your life, a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culiar degree of timidity, where the happi∣ness
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
of those you love is concerned. From this, my dear girl, and from my foolish jest, by which I have added to the accidental bent of your ten∣der mind, you have harboured an idea very painful to your own friendly bosom; and allow me to say, a little injurious to a certain <HI>unblame∣able</HI> creature, to whom, among other infinite obligations, I owe the great pleasure I feel in giving and receiving from you the name and affection of a sister.</P>
<P>Now do not say "No;" nor think, my dear Lucy, that I am talking to you with the "usual weakness of a wife," who cannot endure, even a syllable, that does but seem to find fault with her good man.</P>
<P>You charge me not to <HI>betray</HI> you to your bro∣ther, but, my good girl, what room is there for any species of <HI>treachery</HI> between parties who have, in truth, nething to hide, as they have no designs or sensations towards each other but those of reciprocal affection? However, to shew you that I am rather the loyal subject, than the abject slave, of my husband, I shall observe your in∣junction, and not impart to him your letter; though, believe me, all the effect it could have upon him would be (if that effect were possible) to increase his affection for you. Let me now assure you, most solemnly, that in the main ob∣ject o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your apprehension there is nothing to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eared from our dear indulgent Audley. To con∣vince you of my perfect sincerity on this point, I will frankly say to you, that, if my good father stood in the post of my husband, as Cornelia's trustee, I should indeed be terrified for the destiny
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
of the <HI>Lovers!</HI> aye <HI>Lovers!</HI> my dear, I will not mince the matter: Lovers they are, as we well know, in reality, though not yet declared so in form. But though I question if ever nymph and swain were more passionately enamoured, or, in most points, more suited to each other; if my good father, as I was saying, had the guardian∣ship of the lady; the rigorous spirit of his reli∣gion would attempt, I know, and I dare say with success, to annihilate the match. The piety of <HI>my present,</HI> and, I may say to you, my <HI>better Lord</HI> (though I really love my father), is made of much gentler, and more tolerant principles. From my parents I learnt all the practices of de∣votion; but it is from your brother alone, my dear Lucy, that I have learnt, I think, the true essence of religion. What is there that I might not learn from him, except what his tenderness would sometimes wish to teach me, because he thinks, and I fear truly that I shall have occasion for it? Alas, must I ever learn that bitterest of lessons, how to bear his loss!</P>
<P>But I am fallen imperceptibly, into a tender melancholy, ill-suited to the time, and very dif∣ferent from the strain in which I meant to fashion my infant reply to your affectionate letter. Hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly for us both, here are objects just here appear∣ing in my sight to give a livelier turn to my thoughts: I can just discern the graceful figure of Cornelia, on horseback, at this moment ap∣proaching your favourite clump of trees. This will be called, to be sure, a friendly visit to me; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, my dear dainty widow, I am not blind to
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
that solicitude with which you are now wishing to know if I have received a pacquet from Italy.</P>
<P>Well, that little scrupulous half-yielded and half-defended heart shall be speedily thrown into new palpitations. Audley has met her, and is walking home by her side. I must put away my paper for the present, my dear Lucy; but before I close it, you shall have, what I know you ar∣dently wish to have, a full history of the impres∣sion which the long and touching narrative of Seymour may make on those to whom I now pant to impart it. Adieu for to day.</P>
<P>LET me now re-echo to you your own lively words, "Read! read! and rejoice, my dear Lucy!" Trust me, the interest of your young and powerful client is strengthened as much as you can wish in the two aweful courts of Love and Friendship. What would I give that you could have been an ocular witness of the various emotions produced both in Cornelia and your <HI>not inflexible,</HI> brother, by a recital of your en∣chanting dispatches from Genoa! That is a gra∣tification we cannot have; but, as you are a dear good girl, and I am eager to banish all your painful timidity, I will give you, as well as I can, a brief and hast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sketch of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cene.</P>
<P>Suppose our fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t salutation over, and my love∣ly guest seated, with lips that dared not, in the presence of Audley, ask a single a question con∣cerning Sey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r I saw, and hastened to re∣lieve, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude of her heart, by saying to my two companions, "I have a great treat for you both; I have just received a delightful history from Genoa; and as I have barely had time to
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
skim it imperfectly, we will secure ourselves from interruption, and my dear Audley will have the goodness to read it to us aloud." Cornelia gave me a look that seemed to say, "Oh, you barba∣rous creature, why would not you indulge me with it alone!" but joyous curiosity soon tri∣umphed over her momentary displeasure. We prepared to listen with all our ears; and my good man entered with his usual chearfulness on the pleasant task I assigned to him. He read with great spirit the honest exultation at the opening of the letter, and not without remark∣ing the graceful modesty of Seymour. "You will readily suppose, that I watched every instant the features of both my companions; their first ex∣pression was that of simple, unmixed joy, in the perfect success of this charitable embassy. As the history proceeded, new and various emotions arose and shewed themselves very visibly in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es that I watched. I must not attempt to give you a very minute account of these, as they would render my letter more voluminous than Seymour's; but there were two or three striking incidents, in the course of this reading, that I must describe to you. When Audley came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passage, <Q>It is not, I am persuaded, in the power of nature to present any prospect to the eye so perfectly fascinating as the view of a lovely female heart under strong agitation,</Q> he fixed his arch eyes on our lovely guest, who, sensible of his meaning, turned instantly, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale with terror, my dear, but <HI>crimson, deep crim∣son,</HI> with conscious love. AudIey gave me a significant glance; and, to relieve our dear dis∣trest
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
friend, began to read on, without farther pause. The description of the little Giannina passing the old merchant's door made us all smile; but when my dear devout husband read the fol∣lowing exclamation, <Q>How sweet and innocent are the illusions of affectionate piety!</Q> he ex∣claimed, with an expression of countenance be∣tween a frown and a smile, "Ah, Seymour, we must somehow convince you, that true piety is so far from being full of illusions as you suppose it, that it is the only thing which can separate illusion from human joy." He added, with an air of cordial friendship, "if we can but teach you this simple truth, we shall very easily make you one of the happiest, as you are certainly one of the most amiable men in the world." Another full blush, and a half sigh, here escaped from Cornelia. Audley read on, very generously, without casting his eyes towards her. When he came to Seymour's sudden languor, and affect∣ing discourse to the old merchant before he would accept his cordial, Cornelia and I burst into tears that we tried in vain to check. Your brother, who is, you know, by nature used to the melting mood, soon completed the weeping party: he read and wept, and wept and read, till at last, seizing the transported Cornelia by the hand, he exclaimed, "By heaven, my dear widow, it is impossible not to love this bewitch∣ing Seymour! The rogue has melted me into a woman, and made me in love with him myself."</P>
<P>There, my dear Lucy, there's a charming specific for your fits of timidity. Now have I a great mind to throw down my pen, and leave
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
to dwell on those comfortable words; yet I will not be so cruel to you as to suppress one cir∣cumstance, which, as my dear Audley said to me when we were alone, displayed to him at once the native modesty of Cornelia, and her rooted passion for Seymour: when my husband read the words, "my adored Cornelia," she did not, as I maliciously expected, start suddenly or blush at the sound of her own name so tenderly introduced. In truth, she did not believe those words existed in the letter. Pray admire this diffidence in our lovely friend As Audley had rallied her a little on her supposed affection, she concluded, in the simplicity of her heart, that he had sportively inserted this passage as a conti∣nuation of his ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llery; and she laughed at him, in her turn, for supposing her so credulous. On his protesting his veracity, and placing before her eye the identical words, "my adored Cornelia," written in fair and large characters, her tears fell instantaneously on the paper: I could not restrain myself from giving a voice to them, and ex∣claiming, in the words of the scarcely less sim∣ple, and certainly not more enamoured Mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anda,
<Q><L>I am a fool</L>
<L>To weep at what I am glad of.</L></Q></P>
<P>As soon as I had pronounced my wicked quo∣tation, I was ready to bite my tongue off, for my poor friend was bitterly distressed, and cast upon me an eye of heart-wounding reproach; but your brother, who is, you know, the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exterous of beings in relieving the embarrassed,
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
soon put us into perfect good-humour with our∣selves and each other.</P>
<P>In short, we are now all harmony and hope; take your full share of this joy, my good girl; and trust me, if you continue to send us <HI>such dispatches</HI> from your interesting client, you will have little reason to tremble for the final issue of his cause. I wish I was sure of seeing you mar∣ried as well on the day that unites him to Cor∣nelia. Do not insult these my good wishes, dear Lucy, with a toss of supercilious virginity; but, if you pretend to doubt of their wisdom, pray give me full credit for their kindness.—Accept our united love, and believe me ever,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>WITH all your extensive speculation, my dear Philosopher, on human characters, you have never seen such a creature, I am per∣suaded, as Giuliana: and let me add, that al∣though you have studied this beautiful <HI>unique</HI> in scenes of solitude and of sorrow, where you might imagine that all the finer mental folds
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
would unveil themselves to your observation, you are still unacquainted with half her perfections. I have heard many a woman called an angel—I have seen and heard many look angelically, and talk angelically—but I never beheld the absolute angel in female conduct till I saw Giuliana re∣pairing all the various evil which past events have produced in the house and bosom of her fa∣ther. How sublimely beautiful does a human creature appear, who, in the bloom of youth, and with every personal attraction, instead of being actuated by any selfish or perilous thought or passion, has no design, no idea, no sensation, but what originates and centers in the good of those friends whose peace and happiness she seems commissioned to superintend, without any por∣tion of their natural infirmities! In truth, Giu∣liana now appears to me so much the angel, that I should almost call it profaneness in any man to think of making her even a wife. She is—I do not mean to speak with any foolish jocularity, but in serious verity—she is too spiritual for such a department: all the warm and half-wanton <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood; all the little amiable caprices which form, you know, the attractive essence of female cha∣racter in a young modest woman; all these, that must have existed in the frame of Giuliana, seem to be refined into soul, into mere intellectual be∣nevolence. The fact, I am persuaded, is that all her faculties, and sensations are absorbed in her sublime and eternal passion for Peverell; it is the ambition of her heart and spirit to be unit∣ed to that dear idol in paradise; and her tempe∣rate enthusiasm persuades her, that she will most
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
effectually accomplish this great object, by mi∣nistering to the temporal and to the coelestial interest of her father: whether she will succeed or not, in raising the old merchant to Heaven, I shall not presume to determine; but I may safely assert, that she has rescued him from that earthly Tartarus, an ill-assorted marriage. I have now passed eight very interesting and rapid days in their house; it is utterly beyond my power to describe to you the exquisite address, delicacy, and spirit, with which she has carried many im∣portant points in this period: I must content myself with giving you the result of her influ∣ence. In the first place, she has acquired, and exercised wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and becoming gentleness, that ascendancy and dominion over the impetu∣ous old man, which a pure spirit has over a per∣verse one; she has di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entangled him, in the most graceful manner, from his matrimonial perplexity; not by any abrupt opposition to the projected m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch, but by teaching him to marry, as our militia-men fight, by a substitute. It for∣tunately happened, that a young distant relation of Seignor P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nelli was more enamoured than himself of this captivating and formidable widow. Giuliana, with inexpressible dexterity, persuaded her embarrassed father to become an advocate for the stronger and more seasonable passion of his young kinsman; and to toss a little of his own superflous gold into the scale of his rival, which he wished to preponderate against himself. By this singular alliance, between Plutus and Cupid, the arduous affair has been happily settled, in a manner to accommodate all parties. I have still
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
to relate to you another delightful instance of Giuliana's conciliating address and disinterested magnanimity. She has negotiated and conclud∣ed a peace between some discordant branches of her father's family. She has even introduced into his house, as his adopted son, a very pro∣posing and accomplished young man, the child of his sister, who, having married to disoblige the high-spirited Pinelli, had experienced his re∣sentment in such a degree, that he not only lived for many years without any intercourse with her con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, but ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnantly rejected her over∣tures of reconciliation on the death of her hus∣band, an event that happened while Giuliana was in England. Such have been the domestic employments of our divine friend since her re∣turn; you will easily conceive how I worship her, and without any breach of my very different de∣votion to my no less adored, and still more at∣tractive, Cornelia, who, even in these busy days, when I have been honourable employed as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nfidant of age and youth, of the father and his child, has not unfrequently been a subject of our animated conversation. Giuliana, in the midst of arduous and intricate business, has the happy talent of attending, not only to her pre∣sent, but even to her most distant friends. You and Lucy will receive, with this letter, several very pleasing proofs of her grateful remembrance. But you, as I have just told her, will join with me in reproving the sumptuous liberality of her gratitude. We have had a vehement contest in a point of delicacy and honour, in which she has subdued me completely both in words and
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
actions. In truth, she invaded me on my weak side, and therefore obtained a more rapid and decisive victory. What think you she has insist∣ed on doing? Would you believe that she has, in a great measure, taken from me the dear office of supplying the musical wants of my Cor∣nelia? She will only allow me to send, on my own account, two favourite airs; while she usurps the prerogative of dispatching, as a pre∣sent from herself to the lovely stranger, an ex∣quisite selection of vocal music. I argued very furiously against the glaring impropriety, and I added the barbarity, of such a proceeding. But my more eloquent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntagonist soon convinced my love, of not my reason, that the terms of re∣proach, which I applied to her design, were in truth only applicable to the opposition I made to it.</P>
<P>What a sublime creature she is!—how impe∣rious in her humility!—She has written a letter to Cornelia. I would almost give one of my hands for a perusal of it; and yet (here is bar∣barity to which even her eloquence cannot re∣concile me!) yet I am not permitted to read, or hear, a syllable of her epistle! — And I also must write to Cornelia—write to her for the first time. O delicious, dreadful task! how shall I accom∣plish it to my own satisfaction! to my own, I am persuaded, it will hardly be possible. I shall think, at every word I write, that I have said too little, or too much. How capricious are the human faculties! Now could I more easily scrib∣ble a volume to thee, Edmund, critical as thou art, on the most crabbed f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t thou could<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
propose to me, than write ten easy elegant lines on a happy occasion to my candid Cornelia. It must, however, be done, and speedily too; so farewell, my dear Edmund. Tell Lucy I hope to bring her home a husband that she cannot ob∣ject to, the new-adopted brother of Giuliana, the young Seignor Morone. I have not time to send her a portrait of him at present: but I shall have sufficient opportunities to draw it; for he is to have a little establishment at Rome during the winter; and as I think it most eligible for me not to return to England till the spring, we are to keep house together, and to be honoured with a visit from the incomparable Giuliana and her <HI>regenerated</HI> father. O that you could escort Cor∣nelia for me to some Roman temple of Connu∣bial Juno! But all in due time. Once more farewell.</P>

<P>I FIND that to take an interest in your amuse∣ments it is not necessary to have had the happiness of seeing you. I am almost ashamed to tell you, that a person who never enjoyed

that happiness has robbed me in a great degree of the honour and the delight that I proposed to myself in executing your musical commission. The lady Giuliana, to whose very singular his∣tory and character you are no stranger, has so forcibly pleaded for the gratification of sending you such a collection of music as she thinks may be most agreeable to you, that I have been forced to suspend, but not to relinquish, my invaluable privilege of acting as your servant; as a little memorial of my duty, I take the liberty of add∣ing to her judicious selection two favourite airs, peculiarly expressive of maternal tenderness. And happy indeed shall I think myself when I have the opportunity of hearing them from a certain voice, which has the power of giving new delicacy and grace to the purest and most graceful sentiments of nature! The language and music of this country are justly famous for speaking to the heart. I feel that they do so. Yet allow me to say, I am so true an English∣man, that, highly entertained as I have been at Genoa in hearing several of the Italian songs now travelling to you, I shall be much more delighted in hearing them from English lips.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO HENRY SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are indeed, my dear Seymour, the very prince of ambassadors. No words can sufficiently express to you how much we re∣joice in the success of your negotiation, and how much we are enchanted by the admirable dexte∣rity and spirit with which you have accomplished the great object of your wishes; nor let me fail to praise and thank you as I ought, for the feli∣city and kindness of your description, which transports us to Genoa, and makes us absolutely your companions in every interesting scene. We cannot satiate ourselves with repeated peru∣sals
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
of your delightful narrative; and though we have twice read it regularly through together, Lucy and I are almost ready to quarrel for the separate sheets that each is eager to devour alone.</P>
<P>Tell the noble Seignor and our divine Giuli∣ana, that, separated as we are by the ocean, we see, we hear, we embrace you all every day; and take a full share in those scenes of heart-felt delight, which have arisen so happily, my dear Seymour, from the admirable exertion of your talents and virtues. I see how ardently the grateful, the angelic Giuliana will wish you to be rewarded: I desire therefore that you will tell her, in a whisper, a piece of private intelligence, that I am sure will add very considerably to her present satisfaction —tell her, we have already a reward for you equal to her generous estimate of your merits; yes, you happy and meritorious favourite of the fair, you will allow that I have not exaggerated the value of this reward when I bestowed it upon you <HI>in a word,</HI> and assure you, from indisputable authority, that your adored Cornelia <HI>doats</HI> upon her adorer. Nay, doubt it a little if you please; so much the better; lest the excess of your joy, conspir∣ing with the native impetuosity of your spirit, should render you absolutely frantic; yet it is an honest truth that my gratitude in the present hour could not withhold from you, though I con∣fess my discretion, or, as you will call it, my timidity, suggested to me some reasons against indulging you completely with so important a secret.</P>
<P>I now behold you ready to ask me a thousand questions in a moment. Patience, dear ardent
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
inamorato, you shall know all; you shall be told, that the feeling, the frank, the generous Cor∣nelia, has owned a passion for you to the friend of her bosom, the compassionate Harriot; from whom the precious secret travelled, through your very zealous advocate Lucy, to me. To shew you how completely I command this pleasant channel of intelligence, I shall let you know that I have seen, and that I admire, your letter to Cornelia. You have ingeniously contrived to make violent love to her without saying a sylla∣ble on the subject. Indeed I greatly approve your caution and delicacy: I did not observe a word that Prudence herself in the weeds of a widow, could possibly carp at. Your unaffected Cornelia sent a copy of your letter to her confi∣dante, with an honest confession of the delight she received from it: yet the dear dainty creature is resolved not to marry: no; you are too wicked, magnanimous and engaging as you are; and all other men are out of the question.</P>
<P>But seriously, my dearest Seymour, you must be very guarded in your behaviour; her heart and soul are your own, if you will but avail yourself with prudence of the victory you have gained.</P>
<P>As I send you such intelligence as will, I know, occasion a wild ferment in your veins, let me cool them with a little icy admonition: First, I advise, nay, conjure you, to remain, as we wisely settled for you, the whole winter in Italy. Secondly, be cautious, I beseech you, in your conduct there. Beware of all the wild frolicks to which your runaway spirits are so apt
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
to betray you. Do not poison your blood by any gallant compliance with the wishes of an Italian princess; and pray, when you are at Rome, let not your flaming abhorrence of superstition ex∣cite you to kick the whole College of Cardinals out of the imperial city, or to sacrifice the poor Pope himself to the manes of your favourite Brutus.</P>
<P>It is hardly fair in me, recently and inexpres∣sibly indebted as I am to your ardent virtues, thus to rally you for that impetuosity of spirit whose excesses I apprehend; but you will read my love in my fears, and my fears in my raillery.</P>
<P>I have yet a million of things to say; but I write at present in extreme haste, to seize an un∣expected opportunity of sending this to you by a private conveyance. Perhaps my second letter may reach you before the first, which had nearly happened in the arrival of your two enchanting packets from Genoa, as they came to me within a few hours of each other. I would not begin writing to you in return, till I could tell you how graciously your delicate <HI>love-letter</HI> in <HI>dumb shew</HI> had been received by your dainty idol; be∣cause I knew that a letter which failed to tell you this must be of little or no value to so passionate a lover. Seriously, my dearest friend, you may hope and believe every thing you can wish in that quarter. Her heart, as I have said, is ab∣solutely yours. My brother (as well as Lucy and Harriot) is warmly your friend. How can such a hero fail, supported by such confederates? In short, you have not an enemy to encounter. For Heaven's sake do not make one of yourself;
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
as that, I am persuaded, would be the only one we could not overcome. Still harping, you find, even in the midst of exultation, on the string of timidity. But how can I be perfectly free from apprehension, when I know your indiscretion on a certain article is almost as great as my anxiety for your happiness? Laugh, however, as much as you please at my timidity, if you will but cautiously adhere to the advice of</P>

<P>HERE I am, dear brother, as safely lodg∣ed in the noble and pleasant mansion of our Cornelia, as the prosperous Seymour is effec∣tually lodged in her heart. There he is, believe me; and so perfectly has he made it his home, his house, his castle, that you cannot tap at the door without seeing him at the window. As
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
often as I have had opportunities to speak in private to my lovely hostess, the fascinating tra∣veller has started up as the never-failing subject of our conversation; and more than once, after the good, tender, scrupulous creature, has de∣sired, half-smiling and half-sighing, that we might talk of him no more, she has undesign∣edly introduced him herself. Ah, Love, Love, what havoc dost thou make in the memory, sen∣ses, judgment, and all the bodily particles, that form the composition of that poor weak creature called a woman! But, dear Mr. Philosopher, do not grow too proud in your solitude while you read this reflexion; for you know, by woeful experience, the case is not much better with you imperious lords of the creation. How often has your own magisterial reason, when guarded and graced by an orderly train of arguments and resolutions, like a set of important constables at∣tending the Lord Mayor; how often, I say, has this masculine reason of yours, with all its re∣tinue, been reduced to disappear, like a poor skulking magist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate in the tumults and conflagra∣tion of the metropolis! Yes, my dear lecturer in philosophy, this said love, whether licentious or chaste, is a terrible disturber of our peaceable faculties; and as I, by paying a heavy fine, am released, I hope, from all future chance of wearing his burthensome, tho' honourable chain, I find an agreeable exercise and amusement in trying to lighten the yoke of this tyrant for my friends of either sex. You have taught me to cherish the belief that I have done you great service, both by tender consolation and ludi∣crous
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
reproof; I wish I may succeed as well in Cornelia's case, which is directly opposite to yours. You destroyed the peace of your life by having <HI>no scruples,</HI> and she is a little disposed to produce the same effect by indulging <HI>too many:</HI> alas! if the rich, the wise, and the good, find it so very difficult to make themselves easy, how dismally restless must be the lives of the poor, the weak, and the wicked! See what a mora∣lizing creature you have made of a mere rattle, by your habits of contemplation. I have fallen, you find, already into grave reflexions, instead of giving you a lively description of this charm∣ing scenery, and the pleasant day that introduc∣ed me here; but you shall have it all, as I am bound in gratitude to send you as long a letter as the dear solitary bachelor can wish to receive.</P>
<P>First, let me tell you, as you have not been here for some years, that this charming spot is a thousand times more beautiful than it was when we paid a visit together to our poor departed relation. Both the house and grounds, which used to exhibit somewhat of his austerity and gloom, appear to have caught the lively and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>der graces of Cornelia: the old fashioned-square courts, and the never-ending series of stone-steps, that made the whole garden one over-grown stair-case, are all vanished; and, instead of them, you see nothing but Nature embellished with true Arcadian simplicity. In short, the place itself appears to me as a beau∣tiful widow, who has just got rid of an old bur∣thensome husband, called <HI>Formality</HI>; and is at
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
once enlivened and softened by a new lover, called <HI>Taste.</HI></P>
<P>What a wicked and abominable simile is this! Heaven grant the ghost of my old cousin may not torment me for it! but it struck my fancy so forcibly, that I could not help throwing it into my letter, to make you smile in your solitude.</P>
<P>But to return to my own history: my brother and Harriot escorted me hither on Thursday, by their new private road, which really saves a cir∣cuit of about 17 miles; and, notwithstanding all that Harriot has repeatedly said in its praise, it surprized and delig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted me beyond my expec∣tation. In the first place, the road itself is con∣trived with a most happy attention to picturesque beauty; and, secondly, it exhibits a succession of the sweetest cottages that I ever beheld; half of these, you know, were built by Sedley, and half by my brother. And these two charitable landlords seem to have had an amicable conten∣tion which should produce the most pleasing and perfect specimens of rustic comfort, content, and chearfulness. Every tenant of a cottage has a certain number of these private gates allotted to his care, with some territorial rights and privileges, for the maintenance of his fa∣mily: the most deserving characters in humble life were selected for these stations; they all prosper, and all together compose a succession of scenes that pleased me even to tears; but you know I am an odd creature, and often weep where other folk would smile, and often laugh where they would be sad.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189"/>Harriot, who is, you know, such a rare good wife as to delight more in a tribute paid to the benevolence of her husband, than in any com∣pliments to her own beauty or understanding, was gratified in the extreme, by the cordial admiration I expressed for this enchanting road, which I begged leave to christen by the name of <HI>Jacob's Ladder,</HI> as it seems to lead ultimately to Heaven, and its steps are covered with little cherubims. My dear conductors having safely lodged me in this mansion, which is, perhaps, as like Heaven in the pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y and beneficence of its inhabitants as any human habitation can be, returned home again after dinner. The day was a pleasant one in all points, except in their speedy return. Our party at dinner was exactly to my fancy; neither too large nor too small; but most happily formed for agreeable conver∣sation; it consisted only of ourselves and two gentlemen, whom Seymour himself would think entitled to that name, in spite of his antipathy to their coats:
<Q>Their coats they were good, but alas, they were black.</Q>
For our two gentlemen were the minister of the parish and a very pleasing visiter of his:
<Q>An Oxford sage, extremely read in Greek;</Q>
but as polite and gentle in his manners as if he had never heard a crabbed word in his life.</P>
<P>Cornelia has, I think, first-rate talents for conversation; and she exerted them to our ge∣neral
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
delight, not by engrossing a large portion of the discouse, but by her skill in bringing every voice to its proper share in the concert. It sel∣dom answers to repeat conversation, however sprightly and amusing; yet I must tell you one remark that dropt from William, and made a forcible impression on my mind. The mild Mr. C. who often acts as almoner to the charitable Cornellia, was pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing her some just and delicate compliments on her success in relieving some piteous objects of her bounty; and among them a poor woman, the wife of an honest la∣bourer, who had, like her husband, been long remarkable for industry, chearfulness, and good-nature. But being betrayed by indisposition into dram-d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nking, she grew by degrees so splenetic and malignant as to acquire in the neighbour∣hood the appellation of the <HI>Crazy Woman.</HI> In speaking of this unfortunate sufferer, my brother said, "I believe madness has often this origin: as benevolence and sobriety may be said to con∣stitute, in great measure, the perfection of a rational being every deviation from either may be considered as an approach to insanity."</P>
<P>Whether this observation is philosophically and medically true or not, I shall leave you, my dear solitary philosopher, to consider; but it struck me forcibly in the moment I heard it, and has since been a subject of my meditations; you, my dear speculatist, are so severe as to think that no animals in the creation are so malevo∣lent to their own species as woman to woman. Now, if your bitter idea has any foundation, we may at least set this malevolence in a pitiable,
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
though in a very humiliating point of view, by ascribing it, with my brother William, to a want of vigour and soundness in the intellects of our sex. For my part I am determined to profit by the remark. I have resolved, henceforth, to say and to do all the good-natured things that I can to all woman-kind, for the sake of vindi∣cating the health and dignity of the female un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>I shall begin my new system of benevolence with our lovely widow, by what my dear sarcas∣tic Edmund will call a rare instance of female friendship: I mean, by persuading her to make herself happy. In serious truth, you may de∣pend on my being as warm an advocate for your friend as you can wish me to be; but how little does he want a new advocate, when Love and Music are at this moment stamping his image still deeper on the soft little heart, sufficiently prepared to receive and retain it! Cornelia is delighted with the songs he has sent, and seems never so happy as when she is singing them. Her powerful notes have just ascended to the chamber where I am writing; and, after so long a scrawl, I am sure you will allow me to throw down my pen abruptly, that I may hasten to catch more distinctly the sweet warbling of this amorous nightingale.</P>
<P>Will she continue to sing so delightfully if we put her, as we so eagerly wish to do, in a cage? That is uncertain; but this I know, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she is not put in the cage I allude to, she will cer∣tainly sing, if she sings at all, with a thorn at her breast.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. EDMUND AUDLEY TO SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>WELL, my dear inamorato, one of your passionate prayers is compleatly accom∣plished. Never was my poor friend Peverell, living or dead, more vehemently idolized by the ardent G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uliana than you are by the timid, the tender, the melting, Cornelia! 'Tis so, by all the powers of Love, if I know any thing of woman's heart, which I have studied in truth with sufficient application more years than you have. Your good friend the penetrating and zealous Lucy has furnished me with a hundred proofs, which you would have patience, I sup∣pose, to peruse, if they were set forth in a fo∣lio volume, notwithstanding your dislike to a book of that size; but as I presume you will give me credit without calling for such a mass of evidence, I shall only mention, at present, one test of her affection for you, that I am apprehensive you will think a little unpalatable,
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
and I would willingly assist you to relish and di∣gest it: She has resolved not to employ her own dear dainty fingers in writing any sort of an∣swer to your ingenious love-letter. Here I see you stare and frown, and protest that it is im∣possible! that she must write to you! that com∣mon politeness requires it! with a thousand other protestations full of surprize, disappoint∣ment, anger, spleen, and love. Alas, my dear friend, I fear this rotation of turbulent senti∣ments is a necessary tax, that all mortals must pay for their amorous delights, however licen∣tious or legitimate, however gross or refined. I have just paid the galling tax myself; and feel it so heavy, that I am almost on the point of relinquishing for ever what I can only hold by a tenure so tormenting; a certain female, whose capricious love for me is a secret to all the world but you, has seized me, since your departure, beyond all description. How often has she led me to repeat those truly poetic and truly philosophical lines of Rowe, on the sex.</P>
<Q>Each motion of their heart rises to fury; and Love in their weak bosoms is a rage as terrible as hate, and as destructive.</Q>
<P>You will say, perhaps, of your more gentle widow,
<Q><L>She disclaims</L>
<L>Strife, and her wrangling train of equal elements.</L>
<L>Without one jarring atom was she form'd,</L>
<L>And gentleness and joy make up her being.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="194"/>It may be so, my good friend; I confess she is of as soft and delicate a mould as I ever ob∣served in a female: but she is a woman; and as such she will infallibly try the patience of her lover, especially as she has one who can hardly reckon patience among the constitutional cha∣racteristics of his temper.</P>
<P>But to return to the point whence I have sadly digressed, her resolution not to write to you, and the reason why you should contemplate that resolution with more pleasure than chagrin: had she not loved you, most assuredly you would have had a letter from her; for I think, as I know you do, that she ought <HI>in courtesy</HI> to write; so she ought <HI>in discretion</HI>; but the most sensible and accomplished women perpetually over-shoot their mark on this ground. Whenever they conceive a vehement affection, they never fail to betray themselves at an early period of it, by an excess of reserve. Cornelia, however, thinks she has a full excuse for not writing to you, in the opportunity she has of conveying her thanks to you, by her correspondence with the dear, though unseen, Giuliana. I own I would give something for a view of their singular and mys∣terious correspondence; but even Lucy, who is treated with great confidence by your ingenuous though timid widow, is not permitted to see a line, and can only discover that Giuliana has spoke of you with that friendly enthusiasm which your signal services have deserved. Pray tell that divine woman, if she is really a woman, and not a being of a higher class, that I adore her more than ever, as I am sure you must, for this
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
bold, yet delicate method, of expressing her gratitude to you. I consider their correspon∣dence as a striking omen in your favour; but what omens can a lover want to inspire him with courage, who has visible possession of the heart to which he aspires?</P>
<P>I will only say, therefore, be confident, be cautious, and be happy.</P>
<P>I know your active spirit will fret now, because you have no commissions from your Dulcinea, or I should rather say your Dido, to employ you; but I will take pity on you, so far as to tell you an article she wants, though I question if you can find it where you are; she has a fancy for a beautiful and spirited, yet gentle white steed, with a full mane and tail; in short, such a pal∣frey as Dido might have been proud to mount when she rode by the side of the Trojan Prince.</P>
<P>Now do not quit the hospitable roof of the no∣ble Seignor Pinelli; do not give up your pro∣jected residence at Rome, to plunge into those wilds of Arabia where the most beautiful horses are to be found, and where a horse, as travellers tell us, is brought to practise the most spirited and the most gentle of human virtues, by being cherished as a friend, and caressed as a child.</P>
<P>I know your affectionate impetuosity is strong enough to lead you round the globe, to gratify even a whim of the woman you adore; and I really should not be surprized to receive a letter from you dated Hejaz<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Famous for horses of the most noble breed.</NOTE>. Remember, however, that the sarcastic monitor, who has said so much
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
to you against any precipitate addresses, has al∣lowed you to commence your siege in due form on the first appearance of that grand season for all amorous and warlike operations, the spring; so do not wander too far; but, wherever you may rove, rest assured, that the interest of your heart will not be neglected in this country, and that you have a vigilant, zealous and faithful agent in</P>

<P>P. S. I hope Giuliana has received a long let∣ter from me, with the best return I could make for her splendid present. I should have said a great deal against the costliness of her kind re∣membrance, had not affection induced me to sa∣crifice my own pride to the indulgence of her imperial gratitude. She knows me well enough to be assured, that the strongest proof I can pos∣sibly give of my entire regard is, to accept, without murmuring, a gift of great value. She is, indeed, as I have told her, the only mortal existing who could exert such a despotic domi∣nion over the most intractable of my feelings, and make me chearfully play the part of an Asiatic slave, bending under the weight, and yet smiling at the splendor, of unexpected and unmerited munificence.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>NO, my dear Edmund, I write to you, not from Arabia, but from Rome. Here is your impetuous friend; but, alas, his impetuo∣sity, like that of Rome, is no more. In truth, I am as much reduced in spirit, and as crest-fallen, as this poor old draggled-tail Queen of cities herself. I am as much mortified and as splene∣tic as one of her paralytic, yet ambitious, car∣dinals, who has just lost his animating prospect of the papal throne. Notwithstanding all the kind ingenuity of your friendship to soften my chagrin, I am wretched, under the uncivil and barbarous resolution of Cornelia not to answer my letter! Shall I frankly confess to you, how violently I was at first affected by her unexpected silence? it inflamed my pride almost to frenzy; and half-palsied my love. Had the divine Giu∣liana been accessible as a wife, I should, I be∣lieve, in the instant have united my destiny to hers; but I did not wound our exquisitely feel∣ing and open-hearted friend by any such propo∣sal; and this angelic creature has joined her efforts to yours, in trying to persude me, that I ought to consider an insult as a proof of affec∣tion. Alas, my dear monitors, how fallacious
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
are your arguments! do women hesitate to write, when their passions are awakened? No, no; to scribble when they really love, is the first delight of their souls; it is their passion, even in infancy; and their little fingers itch to scrawl a billet-doux before they can well hold a pen. No; it is plain enough, her heart turns from me with abhorrence; and for this I am indebted, I suppose, to some of her pious friends: but they, and she herself, shall feel, if I live, that I am not to be insulted with impunity; they may make me, if they please, an object of their ha∣tred; but never of their contempt.</P>
<P>That you, my dear sober friend, may not think me too precipitate in my indignation, I must tell you, Giuliana has had a second letter from Cornelia; and would not shew me a line of it, though I begged for the indulgence as if my very being depended on a perusal of that tor∣menting paper. The friendly angel has vainly tried both to argue and to laugh away my resent∣ment; promising, that, if I behave well, she will treat me with a whole paragraph from the next epistle: but I will not allow even her charitable virtue and her enchanting spirit to jest away my very just indigna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion; and to act as a proxy for Cornelia, in making a fool of my heart.</P>
<P>How fully have I experienced, since I entered this city, the truth of Metastasio's maxim, that objects change their appearance according to the tranquility or the tempest in our hearts. When I paid my first visit to Rome, a very few years ago, with what ardour did I ascend to the capitol! my pulse seemed to beat with Roman energy as
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
I surveyed the monuments of Roman magnifi∣cence; and my soul caught fire in the recollec∣tion of those heroes whose virtues illuminated the scene around me: it is not so now; these ruins and palaces, this strange mixture of debility and splendor, only feeds my spleen and increases my melancholy; yet I am pleased to wander alone among shattered columns and broken arches, and find somewhat of soothing sympathy between grandeur in desolation and love in despair.</P>
<P>I am just returned from sauntering, and lean∣ing, a gloomy reverie, against one of the three pillars that remain of the temple which that cold-blooded coward Augustus built to Jupiter Tonans, on his narrow escape from a deadly flash of lightning; and so stormy were my thoughts in this station, that I almost wished to meet such a stroke of heavenly fire as the dastardly tyrant was so thankful for escaping.</P>
<P>Pray is it a proof of man's sociability, or of his selfishness, that when our own prospects are blasted, we lose our lively interest in those of others: the poor young Seignor Morone, with whom I am quartered here in an excellent house, is, like other objects around me, not a little overshadowed by the present gloom of my spirit I once talked, you know, of bringing him to England, as a husband for Lucy; but pray tell her, with my kindest good wishes, I have relinquished the project, and she must pro∣vide for herself. Morone is indeed a good and sensible young man; but he is as unfit to relish the wit and sprightliness of your sister, as I am
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
to enjoy, in my present humour, the various delights of Italy.</P>
<P>Our dear friends of Genoa will be with us in about three weeks; and then, I hope, you will receive a more chearful pacquet from this mor∣tified traveller, whose spleen, I fear, you will now think immoderate; but whatever excesses it may rise to, be assured, my dear Edmund, it can never overwhelm that affection with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. EDMUND AUDLEY TO SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>YOU want, indeed, my dear Seymour, a Mentor in your travels, to guard you against yourself—believe me, you have no other enemy; and think me not too severe if I add, you cannot have a worse. I am seriously angry with you for being so barbarously unjust to the tender Cornelia, and so blind to your own ad∣vantages. I am almost angry enough to punish you with cruelty nearly equal to your own; and to withhold from you a piece of news that may prove a sovereign remedy for your spleen. But, if I did, I believe your partizan Lucy would
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
think that I deserved, like an ungrateful and inhuman tyrant, to he cut off by a dose of do∣mestic poison. So, in pure self-defence, I must inform you, that your lovely opulent widow has been furiously attacked by a most formidable as∣sailant; and has defended herself with infinite spirit, skill, and success. In plain English, that I may not torture your flery imagination, let me tell you, her insinuating and splendid neigh∣bour, the Peer, has exerted all his abilities to se∣cure the possession of her hand; but with so lit∣tle effect, that he has now abandoned the enter∣prize in absolute despair. There is a triumph for you, that you little deserved in your late fit of querulous ill-humour!</P>
<P>Now do not let your exultation be as unrea∣sonable as your spleen; for she does not reserve herself for <HI>you</HI>; no, you wicked humorist, en∣gaging and all accomplished as you are, you are not good enough, she says, for a husband; and as to all the other men in the world (mercy on us!) there is not any one that is merely tole∣rable: so, for her part (alas, the poor hapless creature!) she is devoted to eternal widow∣hood.</P>
<P>Aye, you happy rogue, how will you make all these petty isicles, that are so apt to hang on the retired and solitary heart of a truly delicate woman, melt at your approach in the spring! Indulge not, I beseech you, any splenetic hu∣mour; but dedicate all your feeling spirit to Hope and Love. If your active and imperious fancy can torture itself in your situation, what would it do in mine connected, as I am, with a
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
wayward bewitching creature, whom I can nei∣ther make happy nor relinquish, and who has the art of tormenting both herself and me, by an affection on which she might build, if she pos∣sessed a more steady understanding, the happi∣ness of both? Yet, perversely circumstanced as I am, by the aid of a little optimistical philoso∣phy, I make myself tolerably contented. I think every mortal should form for himself a sort or mental spying-gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, looking, through the magnifying end at all the good in his destiny, and through the diminishing end at all the evil: but the greater part of mankind do exactly the reverse; and hence arises more than half the misery of human life. Hence the loud com∣plaints, in every age of the world, against the general condition of our existence. Hence the innumerable invectives against woman, the source of our most exquisite delights. I have just had our friend Merlon with me, for a few days, who is a thousand times more subject to spleen than you are; and, as he was also out of humour with his fair-one, he entertained me by inveighing against Love, with all the acrimony of a Cynic: "I think, said he, with that sour vehemence which you can so well represent to yourself—I think Sir Isaac Newton was not only the wisest, but the happiest man that ever passed through the world; because he kept his mind always amused by science, and never allowed his heart to be tormented by a woman." I en∣countered our moody friend as a champion for the sex; and I replied, "Notwithstanding my respect and my passion for science, I can never
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
suppose that the joys arising from intellectual pur∣suits are superior to those that belong to the af∣fections. Do you imagine that Newton, in his sublimest discoveries, felt a transport equal to that of a lover, who, having doubted the fidelity of a woman he adores, finds her faithful and af∣fectionate in the highest degree? Do you think that any author, in publishing a most consum∣mate and celebrated production, can rejoice with an exultation so delicious as that of a fa∣ther, in happily completing the education of a son? No, my friend, as Nature chose to make a warm heart her prime minister for the manage∣ment of her most important concerns, she justly allotted to that minister the richest fund of de∣light."</P>
<P>You, I am sure, my dear Seymour, would have taken my side of the question; and who could have defended it so well, even in the field of friendship, without entering on that of love? who could more properly decide on the joys aris∣ing from our affections and our faculties, than a person to whom Nature has given so much warmth in the first, and so much quickness in the Later? Your adventures at Genoa would, in my opinion, determine the point; for assur∣edly no man of the keenest intellect could feel such exquisite pleasure in a supposed or real dis∣covery of the longitude, as you felt in that happy scene which you so forcibly described to us.</P>
<P>Let the morose and the splenetic say what they please against human life, it is surely a field more productive of enjoyments than of suffer∣ings, if cultivated by one who is careful to che∣rish
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
the fruits and flowers, and eradicate the brambles and the weeds. It would be a Paradise indeed if we could all make, and constantly use, such a mental spying-glass as I have mentioned; yet, had I a patent for making such, I should hardly bestow one upon you; for in truth, you have only to see things exactly as they are, to be convinced that your lot is singularly fortunate; and I trust, the unaided optics of nature are suf∣ficient to make you clearly perceive the recesses of my heart, and all the warmth and sincerity of</P>

and diffusing peace and delight over every troubled spirit around her. She has fulfilled her promise, and indulged me, though in truth I hardly deserved it, with such a paragraph from the pen of my adored Cornelia, that all my proud suspicions, and surly inquietude of soul, are banished, I trust, for ever. Yes, my dear adept in the abstruse science of woman, your judgment in my favour is confirmed; I am con∣vinced that the heart of this delicate widow is, as you have kindly told me, my own; for though she is too modest to make such a confession to Giuliana, yet every word in which she speaks of me is at once a graceful proof of her delicacy, and a most enchanting indication of her love. I feel this so strongly, that my angelic governess finds it expedient to admonish me not to let my ex∣pectations of happiness run too high. I believe, indeed, that I may now appear as much intoxi∣cated with hope as I was lately exasperated by despair. Ah, my dear philosopher, what a rest∣less scene of different tumults does the human bo∣som exhibit! yet who would wish to live in per∣fect exemption from the tender tumultuous pas∣sion? You and Lucy, perhaps, in the profun∣dity of your philosophical meditations. But, if so, allow me to declare, that I am not of your sect; for my part, I embrace the doctrine of that charming female saint of Spain, the warm-heart∣ed Teresa, who gave an incomparable definition of the Devil, in declaring him incapable of love. But seriously, my dear speculatist, it is this passion alone which can render human life to my feelings a scene that I would wish to prolong. I esteem
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
the joys of friendship very highly, yet I confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s they are insufficient to maintain that harmony in my frame which is essential to its welfare. My feelings perhaps are singular and romantic in a great degree. I pretend not to say they are just what they ought to be; but I tell you very truly what they are. When I fancy myself not beloved, my whole frame appears to me as a heavy, auk∣ward, and useless statue of black marble; but as soon as the rising beams of affection play upon it, the dark mass begins to be animated, like the famous statue of Memnon at the rise of the sun; every fibre seems to vibrate with harmony and joy. Such, my dear Edmund, are my own sensations in the present moment; yet I have certainly a striking example before me in our dear Giuliana, that it is possible for a being of exquisite sensibi∣lity to be contented (I may almost say happy) not only without possessing the enjoyments of love, but in the absolute per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asion of having relinquish∣ed them for ever: yet it is not so; for Love is still predominant in this lovely creature: her heart is with Peverell in Heaven; and all her very tender and very successful attention to her delight∣ed father is only a method adopted by her love to ensure her re-union with the prime idol of her soul. She is happier, perhaps, in this idea, than she could have been with the living lord of her heart. There is a delicious and sublime tranquil∣lity in a passion for the dead, that can perhaps belong to no other affection; at least this idea strikes me, when I contemplate the present sera∣phic serenity of Giuliana. Do not think, how∣ever, that I am desirous of consigning my lovely
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
Cornelia to the grave, for the sake of loving her with a more intense and more tranquil ardour. Enthusiast as I am, my extravagances are not so gloomy; and I shall content myself with the hope of soon presenting to your contemplation two ob∣jects which I have heard your acute worship re∣present as the greatest rarities in the world; I mean, love unabated by fruition, and friendship unimpaired by marriage.</P>
<P>I have just made a pleasant compact with Giu∣liana and her farther, who is metamorphosed by his divine daughter into one of the most gentle, generous, and engaging characters, that I ever met with: you know I have a particular venera∣tion for those rare old men who preserve, with elegance of manners, a warmth and tenderness of heart in the latter stages of life. Pinelli has now all these endearing qualities; for his two predo∣minant failings, a love of money, and a passion for importance, are perfectly cured, by his con∣viction that opulence and rank are of little value to that angelic child of his, for whose sake he was once so solicitous to increase his consequence and his wealth. Giuliana has made him amiable and happy, by annihilating his avarice and ambition. His feelings are naturally strong; he had no child but Giuliana; he loved her intensely; and that love, the main spring of his life, after being pain∣fully counteracted by indignation and resentment, has at length recovered its force and freedom, and enlarged the circle of its activity. His past anger has given new energy to his present affec∣tion. He not only loves his daughter better than he ever did; but he seems to love me almost as
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
much as if I were really her brother, for hav∣ing been, under Heaven and you, the fortu∣nate instrument of her restoration to his parental arms. He flatters me on my talents, such as they are; he rallies me on my foibles, and, in short, treats me exactly as a son very dear to him: but, in giving you this sketch of his regenerated character, I have forgot to tell you our com∣pact.</P>
<P>It is briefly this: if I marry Cornelia (oh, that abominable <HI>if!</HI> it chills my blood; let me there∣fore say, <HI>when</HI> I marry Cornelia, our friends of Genoa are bound to visit me in England, on the aniversary of my wedding, provided I can assure them, on my honour, that, in the course of the first half year, I have not experienced a single splenetic hour: if, on the contrary, I am reduced to confess,

To ensure the exact observance of this treaty, you, my dear Edmund, are ap∣pointed its guarantee. But do not hastily con∣clude that I shall certainly incur the penalty of this amicable bond; no, I feel, by the magic influence which a few syllables from the pen of my Cornelia have already had on my bosom—I feel, that a single embrace of that dear tender be∣ing will banish every particle of spleen from m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> frame for ever; and you will see the happiest o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I Now write to you, my dear Edmund, not from Arabia, but from a spot which your sar∣castic penetration could not foresee a chance of my visiting: behold me on the banks of the Tagus! aye, verily, in Lisbon! And now I hear you exclaim, "What, in the name of Heaven, could carry this strange eccentric fellow to Portugal!" Peace; you will be satisfied when I answer, Charity and Love. The first has in∣duced me to assist a poor, a miserable, wandering, yet more than half-dead English invalid; whom I met in Italy, attended only by two helpless wo∣men. The second suggested to me, that, as the spring is approaching, I could not do better than move to a scene from whence I may be conveyed by an easy voyage to that dear object who is soon, I trust, to settle the tranquillity and happiness of my future days. At Rome I chanced to catch a sight of my poor old valetudinarian acquaintance Sir Charles Dawney, reduced, I think, to the
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
most deplorable sort of weakness that can fall on the mind and body of a feeble half-spirited mortal, and literally dying of a rage to live. His two good though ungraceful sisters, who will soon be repaid by his ample fortune for a long and wretched attendance on this selfish skeleton, have led him about, from place to place, just according to the whimsical dictates of his own querulous, mutable, sickly mind; which, instead of teaching him to expect and await the stroke of death like a man, makes him crawl about like a whining child, and foolishly seek, by the most uncomfortable pere∣grination through various countries, that health which no climate can possibly restore to him. For my own part, I confess his despicable and selfish avidity for life, burthensome as it is to himself and his relations, has annihilated my pity for his personal sufferings; and had I been one of his sisters I should, I believe, have been more eager to send him across the Styx, than to convey him to the banks of the Tagus: but these good wo∣men have an inexhaustible fund of affectionate compassion; they have charmed me by their in∣defatigable humanity; and when the eldest in∣formed me of her wish, that she hardly knew how to accomplish, of indulging her emaciated brother in his anxious fancy to pass the month of March at Lisbon, I, like a true knight-errant as you know I am, immediately offered my services to escort them hither. A dismal piece of work I have had of it; but here we are; and I have been rewarded for my trouble, not by seeing the sick man revive, or expire, for he is neither bet∣ter nor worse, but by meeting accidentally with
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
the very thing I wished to find for my Cornelia, a palfrey, whose beauties surpass every thing that I ever beheld in the shape of a horse; it is perfectly milk-white, with a mane and tail so full and bril∣liant that you might almost take them for threads of silver. I have only one thing to fear, that this exquisite animal may be rather too spirited for so gentle a rider as Cornelia; yet they assure me it has carried a lady, and the master of it swore to me it was the property of a Portuguese Dutchess lately deceased. This I take for a mere jockey's story. I have bought the horse, however, at a very high price, and moreover two very fine use∣ful horses for myself and your old friend Robert, who is appointed for life my master of the horse. I have ordered a small vessel from Falmouth, to transport me and my cavalry to that port. I mean to proceed immediately to my divine Cornelia, with my four-footed offering; and, from Sedley-hall, I shall cross the country with all possible ra∣pidity to you, and I hope to be the messenger of my own triumph.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII. CORNELIA TO LUCY AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>WE are apprehensive, my good tender-hearted girl, that you will be frightened out of your wits by the hasty letter dispatched to you in the alarm of yesterday, as I confess I was by the summons which brought me to the bed∣side of our dear Harriot, from whence I now write to you, not, I thank Heaven, to increase, but to relieve you from your terror.</P>
<P>She is sorely bruised, indeed, by the accident, and there is reason to apprehend an event which may deprive me of the opportunity I expected, of bestowing my fine Roman name, as you call it, on a little Miss Audley; but our invaluable friend has escaped miraculously, considering the horrid circumstances of her overturn. Poor Sally, who concluded her mistress absolutely kill∣ed at the first sight of her, desires me to say, she was hardly in her senses when she sent off her letter to you: and as to the honest postilion, his sufferings, I believe, are the worst of all; I do not mean in body, though he has his full share of bruises, but in mind; the good creature ab∣solutely puts himself to the torture, for having been the innocent cause of mischief to "the best lady in the world," as he justly calls her.
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
Harriot commissioned me, just now, to go and console him; and if you had been with me, we should have wept and laughed for an hour, at the odd unaccountable and tragi-comic expressions that poor Daniel made use of to discover how far he was likely to be the means of diminishing the expected family of his master. But I must not ramble from the main design of my letter, which is, to conjure you, in the name of Harriot and in my own, not to think of flying hither at a time that we know it would be so very inconve∣nient to you, especially as you have so very faithful and sympathetic a substitute in me, to take all possible care of your sister. She has determined, with her usual magnanimity, not to send Audley any circumstantial account of this mischance, lest his kind anxiety should hurry him back from Ireland before the business that carried him thither can be brought to a con∣clusion.</P>
<P>I have this moment had a private conference with our medical favourite Mr. Brensil. He is, you know, one of the most sensible soothing creatures in the world; and he assures me there is nothing to fear for the life of our dear patient, even if things take the worst turn they can; but, alas! she may have some sharp sufferings to undergo, and be some time confined. At pre∣sent, though she is full of pain, she has all her usual spirits, and even her pleasantry; as you will find, by her first exclamation to-day, when I entered her chamber in a new-fashioned morn∣ing dress of white dimity, "So, my dear attend∣ant, she cried, this, I suppose, is <HI>à Genoese</HI>; and

Ah, Lucy! still harp∣ing on Genoa, you see—but I will positively throw down this abominable pen, lest it force me to say more than I intend of that bewitching city, which produces such admirable creatures a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Giuliana; for as to any other person that Genoa may contain—you may think what you please, my dear, but I can assure you—no; you will only laugh at my protestations; so I will assure you nothing, but that I am, my dear Lucy,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Sedley Hall.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YES, from Sedley-Hall, my dear Edmund, from a chamber adjoining to that of my adored Cornelia, I write to inform you of my arrival: 'tis well I do not write, as an honest Irishman promised to do, to tell you of my death; for your knight-errant has had a narrow escape of closing his adventures like a true hero of romance, and literally pouring forth his life∣blood before the gates of his fair-one. Behold me now in a state sufficiently romantic, just car∣ried into her castle, in a very bloody condition, with a ball lodged in my shoulder.—I scrawl this billet to you in some haste, more pain, and still more delight, for I am charmed with the incident that has thrown me into my present state, though I must not yet attempt to give you any history of it; I only lament that the blood I have lost was not shed in the defence of my dear widow herself, instead of an humbler beauty in her train; but more of this as soon as I can write with more ease. As I cannot spare Robert, I send this off by an express, lest that rapid rogue Rumour, who runs and magnifies every thing, should get the start of my epistle, and distress
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
you with a report that your friend is shot dead.— Be not in the least alarmed, I beseech you, my dear Edmund; my life is perfectly secure; my wound is this moment dressed by a very sensible pleasing fellow, who has not plagued me with a single hard word in the whole operation. He is <HI>one of us,</HI> an honest enthusiast; and he is so taken with the satisfaction I expressed in my ex∣ploit, in spite of the blood it has cost me, that we are become excellent friends in a short ac∣quaintance of half an hour. He is at this mo∣ment standing by me, to see that I fulfil my promise to him, of writing only a few lines; for my animal spirits are in an odd sort of fluctua∣tion, between energy and weakness; and he in∣sists, with the cordial warmth of a friend, that I remain perfectly idle and quiet for several hours; so I bid you farewell, to fall into a delicious waking dream of my dear widow's return; for she is unluckily from home, attending your sister Harriot on a confounded miscarriage; but the dear tender creature will, I doubt not, return to-morrow, to visit the wounded champion of her castle, and repay a thousand fold all the bo∣dily anguish of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>IT is morning; I have slept little, but I can sleep no more; and as I can contrive to scribble to you as I recline in bed, without much increasing the pain of my wound, I shall begin to write, let my honest surgeon say what he pleases; I am sure his good sense will allow that, to render essential service to the body, we ought first to make the mind easy; and mine will not be so, till I have given you the history which I have promised; and which you, I know, will expect with the most affectionate impatience: so, fillets and bandages, by your leave.</P>
<P>I had a quick and pleasant passage, from Lis∣bon to Falmouth; landed my foreign steeds in excellent order, and, by a brisk march, arrived about five o'clock yesterday in fight of my lovely widow's park-pale; the faithful Robert, leading
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
the white palfrey, was a few miles behind me. My intention was to find quarters for the night at the little inn on the extremity of the heath, and to present both myself and the palfrey to my fair idol the next morning. I was meditating how to manage my introduction in the most de∣cent and graceful manner, when just as I ar∣rived at the first little private door leading from the park to the common, and nearest the house, a scene presented itself to me that I shall never forget as long as I exist: the first object I saw was the youngest of the little Sedleys, standing still, and roaring in an agony of infantine dis∣tress; just beyond him his brother, the little heroic William, trying, with all his might, to disengage a large stone from the earth; for what purpose, do you think? why, truly, to serve the noble little hero as offensive arms against an elderly but gigantic ruffian, who at that moment had got his beautiful nurse in his grasp, and was forcibly carrying her to a chaise that stood ready. You will suppose that I instantly joined the con∣flict, on the side of my most gallant little friend and confederate William, who had actually drawn blood from the stout and barbarous fellow that had seized his nurse, by throwing a sharp and heavy stone at his legs. I made my attack on the opposite quarter, and catching hold of his collar insisted on his releasing the woman. Being one of the most athletic men I ever saw, and frantic with various passions, he griped her fast in his left arm, and threw me from him with his right. He then asserted no very clear title to the beauty in question; swore the jilt, as
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
he called her, had promised to marry him, and added another oath to announce a resolution of shooting any man who molested him in securing her person. In the mean time, the poor terrified female denied his assertions, called him some harsh names, which served to let me know my antagonist (he is a man of no trifling note, I assure you); and, with the most piercing sup∣plication, implored me to persevere in her rescue. The g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l does not want strength of body or mind; she struggled hard to escape; a general scuffle ensued, in which I was lucky enough to set her free, and to receive a large bullet through my breast into my shoulder.</P>
<P>What passed immediately after this I cannot very well tell you, as the force of the ball laid me flat on the field of battle; but nurse, who, as she honestly confesses, was not half so anxious for my life as she was to save her virgi∣nity for a man she loves; nurse, I say, informs me that the moment she felt herself out of the clutches of the lascivious old monster (you see by her expression women have no mercy on the amorous frenzy of an aged lover), she ran, without slopping till she got within the little door of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk, which, as the key was fortunately left on the insi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, she was able to lock in an instant, and thus narrowly escaped her impetuous and frantic pursuer. Not thinking herself even then in perfect security, and seeing the game-keeper at a distance, whom the sound of the pistol had brought toward the scene of out adventure, the poor frighted girl continued running till she placed herself under the protection of his gun:
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
with this guardian she had the humanity to re∣turn to my relief, or rather, I believe, in quest of the poor deserted children: how they support∣ed their terrors, Heaven only knows; the first thing that I can recollect is the rattle of a post-chaise in my ears, and the dear little William creeping up upon me, rubbing my face, and cry∣ing out, "Seymour, Seymour, you an't dead! pray tell me, you an't dead!" I wish to Heaven I could give you a perfect idea of the wonderful spirit and affectionate endearing gestures of this brave little urchin: he will hardly quit me a mo∣ment; and the dear boy even petitioned to sleep in my chamber, for fear, he said, I should want his assistance in the night. O, my adored Cor∣nelia, how lovely art thou, not only in thyself, but in thy offspring! Exquisite beings that ye are, when shall I have the transcendant hap∣piness of saying you are all my own?</P>
<P>But to proceed in my history. When nurse arrived again at the gate, with her new and well-armed champion, the enemy was not only flying, but out of sight. Being foiled in his fu∣rious love, and dreading the chance, we sup∣pose, of being stopped for an assassin, he had jumped into his post chaise, and driven off with the utmost rapidity. The rescued fair, thus ef∣fectually delivered from her fears, now exerted the most lively compassion, and gratitude towards me. It was no easy matter to convey me to the house; for, besides my wound, which bled in a manner that terrified my two assistants, I had somehow got a sprain, which rendered me unable to walk. As ill luck would have it, the coach∣man
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
and groom were out with their horses. What was to be done? Fortunately for me, the keeper recollected a little low garden-chair, in which his poor deceased master used to be drawn, by a servant, to his favourite spots in the park: in this I was soon seated; and the honest fellow, with my zealous friend William, who insisted on having his little hand in the business, drew me to the house. Faint and full of pain as I was, I could not help smiling at the figure I made in this triumphal car, followed by the beau∣tiful and truly grateful damsel that I had rescued, who, carrying the youngest boy in her arms, walk∣ed close behind me, with the most touching soli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tude for the ease and safety of her deliverer. I question it Alexander or Caesar ever enjoyed a triumphant procession so cordially as I did; my vanity suggested to me, that this incident would render me the hero and the idol of this mansion. In truth, all the domestics of it seem as eager to do me honour and service as vanity itself can desire; a few hours will, I hope, convince me, that their divine mistress is as sensibly affected as they are by my adventure, and as eager to satisfy the ambition of my love.</P>
<P>But I have not yet told you all the events of last night. As soon as the men and horses came in the rogues had been gallanting their sweet∣hearts to a distant fair), one was dispatched for the nearest surgeon, and another sent to inform his mistress that she had a wounded knight in her castle. The last messenger fortunately met the surgeon, whom I described to you last night, a few miles from this house. He is a most agree∣able
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
fellow, and, I believe, at this moment under this roof; for, being high in favour with Cornelia, and a continual agent to her extensive charity, he often sleeps here, I find, for the convenience of visiting the various poor patients of the neighbourhood whom she consigns to his care. It was his intention to do so last night, he said, before he heard of my accident. He is a very penetrating as well as a pleasant fellow, and has somehow or other picked up an idea that the lovely widow has honoured me with her affec∣tion. I intend to secure him very firmly in my interest; and, as I am situated at present, I may find him a very useful ally. He is a fine stout warm-hearted son of Aesculapius and Lucina, with a prolific little wife and multitudinous brood of children at home. But neither household cares, nor the wounds and maladies he has to cure, seem to rob him of his peaceful morning slumber; for, though he promised to visit me early, I have nor yet heard him stiring.</P>
<P>You will begin to grow angry with me, for keeping you so long ignorant of the formidable ravisher, who was so near carrying off the luxu∣riant beauty that I once promised to send you, like a rich gift of ancient heroic times. Poor Edmund, your chance is gone! she is destined, I hope, to an humbler, yet, a your modesty will certainly confess, to a more meritorious lover, who has endured the most oppressive tyranny for her sake. But her history, if I can bring it to the conclusion that I have now set my heart on accomplishing, to make this lovely persecuted creature as happy as she ought to be, will form
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
a delicious little romance, and you shall have it entire. I cannot however begin it at present; for here comes my sweet boy, my brave little Wil∣liam, my earliest visiter, to enquire after his wounded friend. I have indeed scribbled till I am weary; so adieu for some hours.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SEYMOUR in Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>SHE is arrived! she has been in my cham∣ber! she has been in my arms! I have folded her to my heart with all the impassioned pressure of Love, Hope, Supplication, Gratitude, and Rapture. Heavens, what a moment! I thought I was literally on the point of expiring with de∣light! Never did I touch in my life such a pair of lips! to ravishingly sweet! so transcendently voluptuous! Venus was a simpleton when she distilled her nectar upon them, for she must have made them ten times sweeter than her own. I could rave about them for hours. Giuliana, in∣deed, has a lovely mouth; but her lips, compar∣ed to my Cornelia's, are like a stony pear com∣pared to a melting peach. Had only ten drops of blood been lest in my shattered frame, they must, I think, have boiled in my veins at the unequivocal symptoms of this lovely creature's affection. Oh, Edmund, I never saw such ex∣pression before in the "female face divine." No language can describe the enchanting mix∣ture of tenderness and of terror that her sweet impassioned features exhibited while I pressed her
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
to my bosom. But tenderness was the predomi∣nant sensation: her very heart and soul seemed to dissolve in a chaste angelic exstacy, while I protested, with literal truth, that it is my ardent wish to die of my present wound in her service, if my life is not destined to be the source of her lasting happiness. The tear of gratitude and of sympathy swelled in her sweet eyes, and she suffered me to take such a kiss as would have overpaid the anguish of a hundred wounds: such a kiss! — You must not however prophanely suppose, that the dear divine creature has been any ways deficient either in discretion or in de∣licacy; verily I think her conduct has been a model of both. But I tell the story vilely, and, from an eagerness to acquaint you with my fe∣licity, I have jumped into the middle of my transports, without relating any of the little in∣cidents that conducted me to them.</P>
<P>I will now endeavour to grow a little more sober in my narrative. Let me begin by inform∣ing you, that my lovely hostess arrived here about noon; and, after a gentle message, entered my chamber (for the wounds that I have receiv∣ed both from Mars and Cupid conspire to keep me in bed). Brensil, my surgeon, was her gen∣tleman usher, and the dear brave little William her page. I would give any sum for an exact sketch of her angelic countenance, in the mo∣ment when her eye was first fixed on my poor pallid figure. No painter, I believe, could do full justice to so consummate a model of compas∣sion, tenderness, and beauty. After a brief dia∣logue of concern and gratitude on her part, and
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
common gallantry on mine, I gave a significant glance to my sensible surgeon, whom I had seen before in the morning; and he obligingly quitted my room, with a promise of a speedy return. In a few minutes I contrived to remove my little friend William on a trifling commission, and forcibly detained the lovely mother, who would have retreated with her son. I told her what perhaps was very true, that my life absolutely de∣pended on her indulging me in a few moments of private conversation; I had observed how deeply she was touched with pity at the first sight of me; and as pity, we know, is a friend to love, I resolved to make the most of this very favourable first impression.</P>
<P>The moment we were alone I burst into the most explicit avowal of my passion. The dear blushing creature would have stopt me, by repre∣senting such a subject as peculiarly unfit for the time; and conjured me to consult the re-esta∣blishment of my health, by banishing all ideas that could agitate my mind. I need not tell you my romantic reply to this friendly argument; my incomparable Cornelia, who had been cover∣ed with a crimson confusion at the first declara∣tion of my love, now began to display, not only great presence, but great dignity of mind; and she addressed me in the following manner, with a composure and gentle firmness of spirit that struck me with new and aweful admiration: "Do not distress me, my very generous friend, by saying things to which I cannot possibly listen without a very painful degree of self-reproach. As you have just laid me under the greatest obli∣gation,
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
let your generosity abstain from every thing that can look like taking an advantage or my gratitude: believe me, I am anxious in the highest degree for the preservation of your valua∣ble life, which you hazarded so nobly in the deliverance of a lovely woman, who, though her condition is humble, has a mind of a superior cast, and is endeared to me more as a friend than a domestic. Her history is singularly in∣teresting: you have preserved her from the basest of injuries; and her gratitude is so ardent, that, if she knew your present address to me, we should perhaps see her on her knees before me, to wrest from me a promise which you say is essential to your recovery. Solicitous as I am for your safe∣ty, and attached as I am to the grateful Caroline, it is possible that your joint entreaties might drive me to utter the words you require; but reflect a moment, my gallant friend, what would your sensations be if you saw me embarrassed and made wretched by having hastily uttered a compassionate promise, which my whole soul was deliberately desirous of retracting." Here I ex∣claimed, "Oh, my divine Cornelia, you shall promise nothing; you shall be free as air: yet love me; for Heaven's sake, love me; or do not barbarously endeavour to prolong my existence!" In saying this, I kissed her hand with the most tender vehemence, and, instead of withdrawing it from my passionate pressure, she thus conti∣nued her discourse: "Let not my great aversion to every thing that looks like prudery induce you, my good Seymour, to misinterpret my in∣tentions: I should despise myself, if I attempted
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
to conceal from you that I am highly flattered by your partiality; and that my heart is full of gratitude and esteem towards you. It is, I think, incumbent on every woman or real delicacy to avoid all appearances of coquettish duplicity, and fluctuating inclinations, with those who have any claim to her regard. For my own part, it is my wish to treat you with all the tender frank∣ness of a sister; but, in return for the openness with which I reveal to you the resolutions of my heart, I must expect you to acquiesce in my sincere desire. Wound me not, I conjure you, with farther solicitation, when I have told you, as I do with the most perfect truth, that I have seriously determined, for the sake of my children, never to think of marrying again."</P>
<P>You will readily suppose that I combated this idea with every argument that Reason, Nature, and Love, could suggest. In closing these vari∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious pleas I said, in a vehement peroration, "that if I obeyed her desire, and silently ac∣quiesced in such a resolution, I should certainly deserve, and probably undergo, the bitterest of all punishments, the punishment of seeing her torn from me for ever by a holder, more intel∣ligent, and triumphant rival." I then painted so forcibly the frantic agonies that I should en∣dure from such a spectacle, that I not only af∣fected the dear tender creature, but absolutely threw my own frame into a convulsion of horror. She was touched and alarmed to a great degree: "For Heaven's sake, tranquillize your spirits, my dear Seymour!" cried the compassionate angel: think how cruel it would be to me, when
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
I am so very anxious for your recovery, to de∣stroy yourself by the mere phantoms of your own impetuous imagination: I know it is very galling to a high spirit like yours, to meet even a shadow of ingratitude where it has conferred the greatest obligation; but indeed you shall never find me ungrateful; and, to convince you that I am not so, I will now propose something to you that may, I hope, restore you to quiet and to health. Will you promise me to calm your agitated spi∣rit, and to drop this subject entirely till you are well, if I assure you on my word of honour, that you shall never see me united to any other man?" "Oh, my angelic Cornelia, I exclaim∣ed, such an assurance, in this moment, would place my tortured spirit in paradise." "Then I give it you most solemnly," the dear angel re∣plied, extending her lovely hand towards me, upon the conditions I have named."</P>
<P>Imagine to yourself, my dear Edmund, my inexpressible transport in this touching, this deli∣cate proof of her affection. I threw around her the only arm I can use, and, pressing her to my heart, sealed our convention by that ecstatic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which I mentioned in the outset of my letter, that kiss upon where sweetness I could yet write a folio, but of which the most eloquent of writers would be utterly unable to give you an adequate description.</P>
<P>When I had dwelt on her lips with the de∣lightful avidity of a bee just settled on the richest of flowers, I released her from an embrace which, from various reasons, began to grow alarming; and, to shew her with what punctili∣ous
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
honour I would adhere to the terms of her charitable treaty, I began to talk on different, yet still interesting topics. First, the health of my good unfortunate friend your sister Harriot, which I have the pleasure to tell you is very nearly re-established. Secondly, the very curi∣ous adventures of my rescued virgin, the luxu∣riant, the grateful, the interesting Caroline. I long to tell you her story; but I must still reserve it for a future letter. I will not, however, close this without telling you a delightful touch of her gratitude to me, which I have this moment learnt from Brensil. The intelligent creature, suspecting that I was half frantic with impatience for an opportunity to make love to Cornelia, very ingeniously contrived, not only to prevent the child's returning to me, but to engage Bren∣sil also in some professional business, that allowed me a much longer period for private conversation than I could have secured without her assistance. My sagacious surgeon, who has a most rapid eye in reading characters and motives of conduct, saw through the grateful girl's design, and made her very honestly confess it. He is a great fa∣vourite, I find, with all the women, and I fancy an admirable proficient in female cases. It is a rule with him, he tells me, to consider the heart as the prime fountain of health and sickness, in more senses than one; and he is very shy of giv∣ing medicine to his patients till he has somehow or other gained an insight into the state of their affections. If my dear widow should call for his medical assistance, I believe the rogue would be almost ready to pound me in his mortar, and
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
dispatch me to her in the shape of a bolus; so convinced is he that I am the only specific for any complaints to which her lovely frame can at present be subject. Having told you his system, I leave you to guess if I did not follow the pre∣cept of my Bible, and honour my physician with the honour due unto him. Pray observe, how religious I am growing; but I must say, good∣night; for I can write no longer. Yet I have not told you, that my divine Cornelia indulged her children and me in a request we made, and graciously took part of a little repast with them in my chamber: after which she departed im∣mediately, to resume the care of your sister; but, in departing, she gave me such a deliciously tender <HI>adieu,</HI> that I could wish to do nothing but dream of it till I see her again. In that hope, I bid you once more, and for the last time, good-night.</P>
<P>I cannot throw down my pen, without en∣treating you to dismiss all the friendly anxiety that I know you and Lucy will feel concerning my wound. I am anxious lest it should be heal∣ed too soon, and oblige me to quit this mansion of bliss for too long an interval, before I can make the lovely mistress of it my own. Surely she cannot persist in the terrific resolution she mentioned. Ah, my blood curdles at the bare supposition. Pray, my dear Edmund, meditate on every expedient that you think likely to make her mine, and to accelerate an event so essential <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he well-being of</P>

<P>I AM so painfully surprized, by the kind ac∣count or your horrible adventure, that I hard∣ly know what to do or to say. Had your messen∣ger not found me confined by indisposition, I had infallibly hurried to you immediately; for I know your gallant spirit makes too light of every dan∣ger, and I am wretchedly apprehensive that your wound may be much more serious than you re∣present it. In the name of Love and Friendship, I conjure you not to trifle with a life so valuable. Consider, you are on the point of obtaining the fondest wish of your heart, and have before you as fair a prospect of your happiness as the world can exhibit. Do not, I entreat you, sacrifice all to any unseasonable contempt of danger; if your surgeon is in any degree alarmed by your case, I

conjure you to send instantly to London for the best advice. I know that, if you are not already more than half dead, you will laugh abominably at my apprehensions; I allow you to do so; but the perpetual monitor must remind you, that your disdain of fear, which stands high among your numerous virtues, sometimes passes the line, and shews itself in the petty groupe of your foibles. Remember Pope's Lord Peterborough, the bravest man of his time, used to say, "Shew me real danger, and I will shew you real fear."</P>
<P>However, if you are really safe (and Heaven grant you may be so!)

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. MRS. AUDLEY TO LUCY.</HEAD>
<P>BLESS us all, my dear Lucy, what a hurly-burly of casualties, sickness, and sorrow, we have had among us! But, thank Heaven, our prospect is growing bright again in every quarter. —To begin with myself: You will, I know, re∣joice to hear that I am once more on my legs; nor will it afflict you to be informed, that I am going to make a charitable use of the liberty I have just regained, and to attend our dear widow in her second visit to the brave wounded knight in her castle. There's spirit and enterprize for you, my dear romantic girl! there's a bleeding lover ready made by fortune for your pen to celebrate, just as your own fancy would make one, according to the true pattern of good old ro∣mance. If you are disposed to exercise your ge∣nius in painting impassioned scenes from the life, you must quit the pensive philosophical batchelor, and take your abode with us; for ours, you find, is the region of adventure. Well, 'tis a great blessing that we can now laugh at the wounds of our young champion, which threw us all at first into a terrible consternation. Edmund and you, I suppose, have had a full history from himself of all that befell him. He may have described to you the delightful visit of his lady hostess. Ah,
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
my dear Lucy, what a visit was that for the ac∣complishment of our wishes! The whole business is done, my dear. You may begin to work the bridal shoes you talked of presenting to her. Would you believe it? The dear scrupulous creature was alone with him for an hour in his chamber! "Dreadful indiscretion!" she exclaim∣ed in confessing it. "Mercy upon us, cried I, 'tis well this tremendous hero had one arm disabled." But her gentle frank heart was so open in its con∣fessions, she came back to me with an agitated bo∣som, so full of pity, gratitude, and of love, that I could not bear to rally her long. Besides, I was, I confess, very impatient to know, as you will be if you do not know it already, what matrimonial advances our hero had made in so favourable an interview; and what concessions he had obtained from our lovely scrupulous friend: no trifling one, I can assure you; she has promised him ne∣ver to marry another man. The lover has who in∣duced his mistress to give up for him all the rest of his sex, must be a weak pleader indeed if he does not proceed a little farther in his argument, and at last prevail on the fair-one to make him a present or herself.</P>
<P>You and I, my dear Lucy, may now, I think, set our hearts at rest on this match; it is a favou∣rite point with both of us, and a point that For∣tune seems as eager to accomphlish as we are. I expect my dear Audley at home again in a few days, I need not tell you with what affectionate impatience. My father, who had heard of my late accident, is coming with him. It gives me particular delight, that I shall present your fa∣vourite Seymour to them both with such an accu∣mulation

of honour on his head. He has not only endeared himself to us women by his courage in this adventure; but he is just now very gene∣rously exerting his interest to redress all the wrongs of poor Caroline's persecuted lover. Could you have thought that the old Admiral would have shewn himself such a frantic brute? What horrid imperious creatures men are apt to be! Because this rough veteran has shed his blood very freely, they say, in the service of his country, he thought himself entitled to make as free as he pleased with the chastity of her daughters; but his outrage to Caroline is rendered doubly detestable by his base oppression of his young fa∣voured rival, who, however inferior to him in rank, is certainly, from what I have learned of his sufferings, more truly brave than himself. If Seymour can accomplish his generous project of uniting this very handsome and cruelly injured couple, he may, I think, command the service of all honest lovers throughout the world. As to poor Caroline, who is, yon know, a sweet grateful creature, she, I find, perfectly worships him already. So, if Cornelia should affect to be inexorably cruel, which is not, I think, very pro∣bable, she must be driven into wedlock by a gene∣ral persecution from her own sex; in which I know the voice of the dear zealous Lucy will be as loud as that of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>AS I think an interesting love-story no bad me∣dicine, my dear Edmund, to inspirit the imgination of a sick philosopher, and as I have nothing new to tell you in the progress of my own passion; I devote this paper to the promised ac∣count of my humble, yet lovely ward, the very grateful Caroline. I heartily wish you could have the high pleasure that I have had, I mean, the pleasure of hearing this little story most admirably told by the eloquent lips of thankful simplicity. But, as I have laid you under an injunction not to hasten to the house where Caroline is to be heard, I shall exercise as well as can, for your amusement, the agreeable office of her historian; if I may trust my own feelings in listening to her narrative, the adventures of few beauties are more worthy of being recorded.</P>
<P>I hardly know where to begin my history; be∣cause I imagine that your lively intelligent sister, who never lets an interesting tender story escape her, must have heard from Cornelia, and proba∣bly communicated to you, many particulars re∣lating to this captivating girl; yet as that may not be the case, I shall briefly tell you the first
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
incidents of her singular life. Caroline Southcote is the daughter of an honest and jovial farmer, who, living with more hospitality than dis∣cretion, left a widow, embarrassed in circum∣stances, and over-burthened with a numerous fa∣mily. It happened that the squire of their parish had a brother settled abroad, as a consul in Spain, who, marrying a Spanish lady, requested his brother to send him over a young English girl, to attend on his wife. The lot fell on Caroline, whole merit and situation out-weighed her want of age and experience: she was a mere child when she was sent into this foreign service, but a very few years converted her into such a wo∣man as might inflame to madness the warm blood of a Spanish Cavalier. She escaped, however, the gallantry of Spain, to be more roughly, and I hope in time more tenderly, handled by a Bri∣tish tar; for the two objects of her abhorrence and her idolatry are sailors. Just as she reached the delightful age of nineteen, in the full bloom of beauty by its nature luxuriant, and rendered still so perhaps, by the climate in which it expand∣ed; at this critical season of her life, the master of Caroline was obliged by ill health to revisit his native country. His amiable Spanish wife em∣barked with him, attended by the lovely girl, whom, as the good lady had produced no children, she ever treated more as her child than her servant. They sailed from Gibraltar in an English man of war, commanded by an Admiral, whose name is well known to you, as he has often signalized his courage in the public service. This warrior, though he is, like Othello, declined into the vale
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
of years, retains, like the Moor, all his keen ap∣petite for beauty; and, I may add, for revenge. He was deeply enamoured at the first sight of Ca∣roline; and never, I must say, was a composition moulded by nature more likely to set a veteran on fire. The Admiral exerted all the advantages of his situation, in trying to gratify his desire; but he found that the lovely girl was impregnable; and having never perhaps met with a repulse be∣fore either in Love or War, he began to specu∣late on the latent cause of this unusual and un∣pleasant event. The searching eye of authority and suspicion soon discovered the source of this mortifying failure: the tender and open heart of the tempting damsel was pre-occupied by a young∣er assailant; she had entered the vessel with a bo∣som well prepared by nature for all the ardour and firmne's of genuine and honourable love; and chance recommended to her favour a fine young fellow, who has proved himself, I think, com∣pletely worthy of her passionate attachment; but, unfortunately for all parties, this favoured youth is peculiarly dependent on his old and ungenerous rival. He is a brave lad, of humble birth, but with the advantage of having received a tolerable, though cheap, education in one of the northern counties; his friends had placed him under the patronage of the Admiral, who had freely pro∣mised, and had sincerely intended, to make his fortune. He had only rated him as a common sailor in his ship, but constantly employed him as his secretary; an office he executed with great in∣telligence, and in which he had not lost oppor∣tunities of signalizing his courage. By his sense,
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
spirit, and affectionate alacrity, he had made himself the prime favourite of the Admiral. In a post so exposed to envy and ill-will, the engaging manners of Edward Monson still rendered him universally beloved; so far was he from being deemed unworthy of the high favour he possessed, that many persons thought him entitled to supe∣rior rank, and supposed, but erroneously, from his having the graceful air of a gentleman and an officer, that he was the natural son of his patron, In the eyes of the tender and discerning Caroline, he seemed worthy of the highest distinction; and she soon give him, what he probably thought su∣perior to all naval honours, the full possession of her virgin heart. The most exquisite enjoyments are generally loaded with immoderate taxes, and Destiny mingled for poor Monson a cup of honey and gall. As soon as the mortified old Admiral discovered the amorous triumph of his secretary, all his splenetic soul was possessed by the demons of jealousy, hatred, and revenge: he was con∣verted at once from a generous patron, into a merciless tyrant, and implacable persecutor. His station gave him every advantage against his de∣fenceless young rival that a base passion could wish, and he exerted these advantages with a mean ferocity disgraceful to human nature. Un∣der frivolous or false pretences, he condemned the once-favoured Monson, now the object of his abhorrence and his envy, to corporal punishment and rigorous confinement. The tender Caroline, in reaching her native land, where she had fondly promised herself the full enjoyment of liberty and love, was reduced to the misery of leaving the
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
man she adored secluded from her sight, and suf∣fering that ruthless oppression which his attach∣ment to her had occasioned.</P>
<P>I never was more affected in my life than by the touching description which the charming girl gave me of her extreme agony in quitting the ship where her lover was imprisoned. She was obliged to fellow the fortunes of her sick master and her foreign mistress; they both died within a twelve-month from the time of their reaching England; and a providential series of incidents threw the desolate Caroline into the service, or I should ra∣ther say under the protection, of my tender-hearted Cornelia. The cruel and furious old Admiral has had, in the mean time, the infernal gratification of persecuting, his helpless rival dur∣ing a long and distant cruize, from which he is lately returned. Poor Monson still continues his slave and his captive: but I have already taken some measures to restore the brave lad to freedom; and I hope soon to enliven you with an account of their success. I can only add to this letter a few more particulars that relate to this interesting girl. Upon my asking her, if her persecuted lover did not contrive to write to her after she landed; "O yes," she replied with an impassioned simpli∣city, "nothing but his precious letters could have kept me alive; and he has a faithful friend in a young lieutenant of his ship, who was so good as to send me his letters by every possible opportuni∣ty." "May I, my good Caroline," said I in re∣turn, "may I without impertinence ask to see one love-letter from this brave injured lad, whom you have taught me to esteem? and will you have the
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
goodness to shew me the very letter (I will ask only for one) which you perused with most plea∣sure?" "Dear Sir," replied the grateful Caro∣line, "after all you have done and suffered to save me from that barbarous old ruffian, I should be a thankless wretch indeed to refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you such a request." At there words she slipt her finger and thumb within the folds of a thick muslin hand∣kerchief, and pulled from her bosom a neat little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of blue sattin, which was suspended from her neck, by a very narrow ribband of the same colour. "Here," said she with a deep sigh, "here is one letter of my poor Edward, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I think it my duty to wear upon my heart both by day and night; that I may retain the fuller sense of all his suffer∣ings for me, and constantly pray to GOD to bless me with the opportunity of making him all the amends that fidelity and affection can make. You may read this, Sir, she continued; but I should tell you, the old barbarian only kept him in close confinement while my master and mistress were on board his ship; but, after we landed, he was wicked enough to have him inhumanly whipt be∣fore the mast. You will see how bravely he bore it," she added, dropping a tear as she entrusted the letter on my hand.</P>
<P>I received with eagerness this highly valued epistle, which had been unfolded so often that it was almost in pieces. Poor Edward is, in my opinion, much more of a true hero than his base commander.</P>
<P>The brave fellow's letter pleased me so much, that I could not help perusing it several times; and I will try if I cannot give you from memory
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
a literal copy of it. I believe it runs exactly thus:</P>

<P>I Had rather you should hear from my own hand than from any other quarter, that I have just endured the basest outrage that man can undergo from the old jealous and revengeful tyrant. How would your soft heart have shrunk within your bosom, in hearing the lashes that have mangled the body of your beloved Edward! I thank the brute, however, for ab∣staining from this iniquity while you were on board; for now my sufferings are nothing in comparison of what I should have then felt for you. I have smarted indeed, and my flesh still trembles with pain; but my heart triumphs in the cause of my punishment; for, in truth, I am guilty of no crime but my love to you; and this is more increased than subdued by what I endure. I almost pity the vain fury of the old mortified inquisitor, for not perceiving that every lash which he inflicts on my body carries with it a delight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul assurance to my soul, that he is detested, and that I am beloved, by the loveliest woman in the world. Oh, my ge∣nerous, my adored Caroline, I am convinced that the wrongs I suffer will increase your attach∣ment to me, and I therefore esteem them as an invaluable blessing.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Sedley-hall.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>JOY! Joy! my dear Lucy! let me pour into your sympathetic bosom some portion of that overflowing joy in which every creature of
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
this seems to be almost overwhelmed. How fre∣quently and fervently do I wish you were with us, that you might completely share the tender jubilee that now reigns in this mansion, where every wall seems to re-echo the triumphant sounds.</P>
<Q>None but the brave deserve the fair!</Q>
<P>Let not your quick imagination, however, conclude from this burthen of our song, that your friend Seymour is married to Cornelia. The sprightly words of Dryden are certainly applicable to them; but at present they are ap∣plied more directly to a happy pair of inferior station, in whose transports you will take an interest as lively as I do, and the more so as their happiness is the noble work of Seymour▪ How you would have wept with delight, my good tender-hearted girl, had you seen what we have seen!</P>
<P>But I will give you a brief history of the last delightful three days. On Tuesday I was made happy by the return of my dear Audley, accompanied by my father, both in high health and spirits: my joy at the sight of them was in∣creased not a little by the affectionate encomiums which they both bestowed on my conduct during the absence of my lord. As he, you know, is always peculiarly alert in the service of his friends, he resolved to set out the next morning on a visit to the wounded Seymour; and, after a little gentle raillery on our tender widow, he settled it for us all to remove to her mansion,
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
and thus assist her, with due decorum, in pay∣ing those attentions to the champion of her castle, which she certainly wishes to pay. I thought I discovered that the dear dainty creature was half-pleased and half-embarrassed by the first sound of this project; but she ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded to it very cor∣dially. We all arrived here yesterday about noon, and had the comfort of finding our wound∣ed hero just in that state which renders him pe∣culiarly interesting, without giving us any alarm for his life. As he was not permitted to dine with us, our little party, at the request of my good Audley, paid him the compliment of drink∣ing tea with him in his own apartment. What a zest does a little mixture of pity give both to love and to friendship! I confess, for my own part, that I never thought this agreeable fellow half so engaging as in his present pall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d condi∣tion; and as to our poor C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnelia, she had such inexpressible tenderness in her countenance, while she listened to the various history which our hero gave us of his adventures, that I con∣ceive the sof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> widow of Carthage to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een an absolute sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to her. In serious truth, my dear girl, we were all charmed with our evening; and Seymour related the late interesting occur∣rences, in which he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had so important a part, with such spirit, grace, and even modesty, that we could all, I believe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve listened to him with pleasure during the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le course of the night, had not som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> countenance, and at last in his voice, given us a signal to retire.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="247"/>You will guess how happy I was in this even∣ing, when I tell you that my father, whom I was, you know, particularly anxious to prepos∣sess in his favour, declared, after we had quitted his room, that Seymour exceeded all that I had said in his praise, and is the most captivating young man that he ever beheld You, my dear Lucy, are not inclined to contradict this en∣comium; but, if you were so, you would still, I believe, subscribe to it, after hearing the ac∣count that I have yet to give you of this morn∣ing, the period of our highest delight and exul∣tation.</P>
<P>As my father had not seen the late improve∣ments in this charming spot, he and Audley breakfasted very early together, and immediately after it sallied forth for a long ride. Cornelia, under the guard of your humble servant and her eldest son, ventured to place her breakfast-table in the apartment of the wounded knight, who had petitioned most eagerly for this indulgence. In a few minutes after the tea-things were sent out, and while Seymour was ingeniously holding us his captives, as it were, by a fascinating de∣scription of some incidents at Genoa, and the filial virtues of Giuliana, we were surprised by the hasty entrance of Caroline. She appeared with a wild April face, full of smiles and tears; and, instead of apologizing for her intrusion, exclaimed, "Here he is, Sir, and cannot rest without the liberty of blessing our noble delive∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>!" As she uttered these words, a fine mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al young figure advanced, and throwing himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstantly on one knee, by the side of the bed at
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
whose feet Cornelia and I were standing, he seized and kissed the hand of Seymour; but, in attempting to speak, burst into tears, "My brave Monson, cried Seymour with a joyful quickness, you are of all men living the man I most wished to see; but do I see you perfectly free? have you got your discharge?" The stranger could not reply; but continued to kneel, and press the hand he held in an agony of gratitude. "Rise, rise, my good friend," said Seymour, who began to be much affected; "you over rate my little services." "Good heaven! cried the lover of Caroline, starting up, is it possible for any human being to owe more to another than I owe to you? No, Sir, my whole life, devoted to your service, could not thank you sufficiently! To you alone I am in∣debted for my liberty, and a blessing far dearer than liberty itself: I am indebted to you for the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervation of this lovely, this faithful, this uns<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ducible woman." At these words he folded Carol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne to his heart, who, instead of being rendered bashful by our presence, returned his embrace with all the tender dignity of innocence in paradise. Surely there is no sight more touch∣ing and pathetic than the meeting of two such meritorious beings, long separated by persecu∣tion, and suddenly elevated to supreme felicity in being restored to each other. The scene melted us all into silent tears; and Seymour wept as plentifully as your humble servant, or even the more tender-hearted Cornelia herself; but he made the first effort to subdue his emotion, and said with a pleasant vivacity to Monson,
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
"Well, my good friend, since the old Admiral has behaved handsomely at last, we will forgive him for all the pain he has made us undergo: he is a gallant fellow; and it is no little proof of his heroism, let me tell you, that he has spirit enough to send such a fine lad as you are to the beautiful girl whom he would willingly give his whole fortune to possess. But what said he to my letter?" "O, I ask your pardon, said the happy bewildered Monson, here is his answer." He now delivered an epistle to Sey∣mour, which Cornelia and I confessed a most ardent curiosity to peruse; but our hero, who had, I suppose, some private reasons for not gratifying our visible wishes on this point, soon gave us a much higher gratification, by shewing us what his princely spirit had for some time pro∣jected, to complete the happiness of this inte∣resting couple. Desiring Cornelia to give him his pocket-book, which had been laid on the mantle-piece, he said, as he opened it, "My dear Monson, though your grateful spirit thinks itself highly obliged to me, yet in fact, if my zeal to serve you stopt here, I may have done you, perhaps, more harm than good; for, by ob∣taining your discharge, I have certainly taken you from a noble profession, and left you with∣out the means of subsistence: it is a duty that I owe both to you and to our country, whom I have robbed of a gallant sailor, to provide for you in some other line, and render you a useful and happy member of society. I am perfectly acquainted with your circumstances, and your resolution to marry the truly deserving Caroline
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
as soon as fortune enables you to do so. Passion and prudence conspire, for once, to second your wishes. I think, in point of discretion, you cannot marry too soon; not so much to secure your bride, whose fidelity neither fraud nor force can subdue, but to prevent this odd furious old man, whose peace and honour we would both with to consult, from relapsing into his amorous frenzy. Let me advise you, therefore, as a friend, to marry immediately; and, that my advice may not appear more an insult than a kindness, you must allow me to furnish you with this immediate provision, till we can find an opportunity of settling you in some eligible employment."</P>
<P>After this friendly and delicate address to pre∣pare the young stranger for what might oppress him, Seymour gave him a paper: and what think you, my dear Lucy, it contained? You will hardly guess, though you, I believe, were the first, my dear girl, who distinguished our hero by the title of <HI>the princely Seymour.</HI> Not to put your curiosity on the rack, I will instantly tell you, it was a draft for a thousand pounds. I shall never forget the face of Monson in the moment he perceived its value. Astonishment, gratitude, pain, and even indignation, were all visible in his features. "No, Sir, exclaim∣ed the high-spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted youth, though I adore you for your generosity, I must not receive it. I will appeal to these excellent ladies, if I should not render myself utterly unworthy of those invalu∣able benefits you have already conferred upon me, if I accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed such an immense pecuniary
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
obligation from any man, without the shadow of deserving it." At these words he held the pa∣per towards me. You will guess that I caught it with no little eagerness; and he added, with a sup∣plicating and distressed countenance, "Teach me, dear madam, how I ought to behave towards so noble, so disinterested a friend." "You are quite mistaken, my good Monson," cried Seymour, "I am so far from being a disinte∣rested friend to you, that in this business I am the most interested being imaginable. I will convince you, in a moment, that you will con∣fer a much higher obligation upon me by ac∣cepting this sum, that I can upon you in bestow∣ing it. I wish you well indeed on your own ac∣count; but I most honestly confess to you, that I have another, and a much stronger motive, for supplying you with this immediate provision: it is to gratify this lady, whose kind heart is deeply interested in the settlement of Caroline; and, by yielding to me an opportunity of plea∣sing her, you will confer an obligation upon me beyond the extent of my whole fortune; and my fortune, in truth, is such, that I shall not feel the slightest inconvenience in parting with a sum, which, by being applied to your imme∣diate use, may make us all happy." While Seymour was saying this, he pointed to Cornelia, whom Monson had hardly observed before; but he now locked in her face with an arch, yet mo∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, smile. That lovely face was covered with one of the deepest blushes that I ever beheld. On perceiving this, I said to Caroline, who had
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
stood weeping and smiling alternately at my side, "Come, my good girl, take and discipline your charming lover in private, I must play the school-mistress here." The happy damsel and her gal∣lant sailor instantly withdrew. A tender and delicate contest then arose between the wounded knight and the more deeply wounded widow, concerning the share each should take in pro∣viding for this lovely couple, who are at all events to be speedily married.—I, who am, you know, an admirable oeconomist in saving the money of my friends, have, I think, settled the business very ingeniously, without any great ex∣pence on either side. My proposal is, to marry them immediately (for I am ever, you know, a staunch friend to Hymen), and let them act directly as governor and governess to the chil∣dren of this house and of ours: this plan will succeed if it has the deliberate sanction of my husband, with whom I am to talk it over at our leisure; at present we are all too much exhila∣rated, by the joyous arrival of Monson, to de∣bate any point very seriously.</P>
<P>Cornelia, who is at my elbow, and who, by the way, looks more beautiful to day than she ever d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in her life, will not allow me to scribble a moment longer.

<HEAD>LETTER XL. FROM Mr. AUDLEY, TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with peculiar delight, my dear Edmund, that I send you such intelligence of your friend as I know will be most welcome to your affec∣tionate heart, and operate as the most animating of cordials on your reviving health.</P>
<P>The brave, the generous, the engaging Sey∣mour, is, in truth, as great a favourite with us all as you can wish him to be. He is admired by one sex, and idolized by the other. As to my lovely ward, of all the modest enamoured wo∣men that I have happened to meet with, she is by many degrees the most deeply impassioned. I never saw the emotions of genuine love so com∣pletely visible in a reserved and delicate charac∣ter. I have studied her minutely in the few d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s we have been here; and there has hardly passed an hour in which her attempts to stifle or conceal her passion have not rendered it more imperious and more apparent. The distant pro∣phecy of my dear Harriot is on the point of being fully accomplished. Chance and Nature seem to have conspired in producing every in∣cident and every feeling most likely to promote a match that is ardently wished, I know, not only by the parties themselves, but by many of their friends. I have formerly expressed to you, with my usual frankness, all my fears and scru∣ples
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
on this very delicate business; it will, I am sure, make you happy to hear from my own hand, that these scruples are vanquished by the beneficent virtues of your friend. You well know my private wishes concerning both your∣self and him; and what cordial satisfaction it would give me, to see two men, whose general conduct is so consonant to the purest Religion, more seriously attached to that only solid foun∣dation both of virtue and of happiness. I do not despair of one day possessing this satisfaction. In the mean time, I must content myself with saying of you both, in my own mind, what Pope, I think, said openly of Garth, that "if there are good Christians in the world, without knowing themselves to be so, you and Seymour are such."</P>
<P>Let me request you, for two reasons, my dear Edmund, to come speedily to us. First, to es∣tablish your own recovery, by a seasonable change of air. And, secondly, to take charge of your young friend, who cannot, I think, in decen∣cy, remain here much longer; and had better be stationed with you till the period arrives when a marriage so universally desired may properly take place How a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dently you, Lucy, and Harriot (not to speak of the dear dainty widow hers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f), are panting for that period, I am fully app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ized; and, believe me, I am disposed to say, with as much cordial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y as of any of you,

I have only to add, that Seymour sends you both his kindest good wishes, with the two letters en∣closed. He has been so obliging as to favour me with a perusal of the two; and, different as they are, they have both entertained me exceed∣ingly. Adieu.

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. SEYMOUR TO THE ADMIRAL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE wound I have lately received from you, which is in no danger of proving mortal, might justify me, perhaps, in addres∣sing you with the language of hostility and defi∣ance.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="256"/>But, notwithstanding what has passed between us, I am ambitious of courting your friendship; to which I have an hereditary claim. You may have learnt from rumour, that the young man you shot in a late hasty scuffle is the son of a person whom, though long deceased, you pro∣bably remember with regard, as the intimate friend of your youth. Allow me, Sir, in right of my father, to speak to you the genuine lan∣guage of friendship; to express a sincere esteem for your public character, and a lively interest in your glory; to solicit your reciprocal regard; to give you information, and let me presume to say advice, of infinite importance to your tran∣quility and your honour.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, he incensed against me for my late conduct; but your anger will cease, I trust, in recollecting that you, in my place, would have acted exactly as I did. I know how difficult it is for a high spirit to relish the idea of retreating, either in war or in love; but per∣mit me to remind you, that a retreat in both may be sometimes more honourable than a vic∣tory. In the point to which I allude, this max∣im is strictly true. You may do infinite credit to yourself, by relinquishing all thoughts of the girl whom you were so resolved to possess. Be∣lieve me, Sir, her heart is invariably fixed on the humble, yet gallant lad, whose fortune and liberty are in your power. I doubt not but, when you are convinced of this truth, however mort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fying it may be to your passion, your spirit will suggest to you how a brave man ought to be∣have towards a successful, yet dependant rival.
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
Let me add, that, in the name of my father, and as the highest favour you can shew to the son of a man once so dear to you, I most fervently and respectfully request from you the immediate discharge of Edward Monson.</P>
<P>My connections in life are such that I could soon obtain, from the highest naval authority, what I would much rather receive from your indulgence.</P>
<P>The son of your spirited old friend may be permitted to add, as a proof of his legitimacy, that, if his just and courteous petitions are re∣jected, he wants not either resolution or perseve∣rance to carry those points by force, which ho∣nour and justice have excited him to pursue.</P>
<P>I shall close this friendly letter by the best of good wishes, that, as you have gained many laurels by conquering our public enemy, you may now enrich them with a nobler palm, by subduing yourself. This, as all the great mora∣lists assure us, is the most honourable of victo∣ries; and that it may be soon added to those which have already reflected a lustre on your name, is the ardent wish of, Sir,</P>

<P>I SEND off a servant express to stop our dear Edmund, if he is not already on his way to this house, so lately the scene of hope and exultation, and now of despondency and wretch∣edness, of wretchedness produced from the most idle piece of folly that ever was heard of. Alas! my dear Lucy, all our high-raised hopes are, I fear, overthrown for ever. Seymour himself has ruined all, in a fit of intoxication, or ra∣ther of frenzy. Surely wine was an invention of the devil, to render man an image of himself. My father takes the part I apprehended he would on the slightest opportunity of this kind. My dear Audley is labouring with his usual goodness to repair the mischief that intemperance has pro∣duced; but I am afraid it is irreparable. Poor Cornelia is more dead than alive; but, as the man and horse are waiting, I will dispatch this immediately; and send you particulars by the post. I am anxious that you and my brother should now remain at home, as I am persuaded your friend will not continue here under his pre∣sent disgrace, but will sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to you for consolation and counsel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! my dear Lucy, I feel so dispirited, exasperated, and bewildered, so intoxica∣ted in short with rage against intoxication, that I can hardly collect soberness of spirit sufficient to give you the sad circumstantial history that I have promised. How very grievous is it to have seen the most delightful of human prospects so foolishly and miserably blasted in a moment! Ah! my dear girl, what inconsiderate wretches are these captivating men! I am almost inclined to think you perfectly right, in having renounc∣ed them entirely. It is no wonder that the com∣plaints of human infelicity are so frequent. How many, many virtues, are required, to form
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
that rare, and lovely spectacle, happiness! and how able is a single vice to produce in an instant that common and deplorable sight, extensive misery! You will not be surprised that I am sunk into this moralizing fit, since, as poor Calista says on a very different occasion,
<Q>Here's room for meditation e'en to madness.</Q></P>
<P>Our present trouble is the more bitter, because the prelude to it was a scene of the purest plea∣sure that I ever experienced. I must begin by telling you, that yesterday happened to be the birth-day of the eldest Sedley. Seymour, who is passionately fond of this charming boy, re∣quested that the day might be celebrated with pe∣culiar festivity; and that, to render it a double jubilee, it might be fixed for the wedding-day of Monson and Caroline; my father, who ex∣ults in all festivity that carries a religious sanction along with it, not only joined in the request, but desired to have the pleasure of uniting this lovely couple: you will believe this business was readily adjusted without a dissentient, or even a hesitating voice; for Caroline, though truly modest, has not a grain of prudery in her com∣position. Seymour, who was recovered enough to attend the ceremony, which was performed in the chapel here, acted as father to the bride, with his usual elegance of manners; and visibly felt emotions, not inferior to those of a real parent on the occasion. Here I wished not a little for you, my dear Lucy; for, as you think a wedding where youth and beauty are united,
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
with genuine affection, a very touching drama, you must have shed many delicious tears had you been with us: there was no creature present but ourselves, and five servants of the family: my father read t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e service with peculiar energy and feeling, and the whole scene was conducted with such devout decency, and universal delight, that for my part I wept, I believe, from one end of it to the other: how poor Cornelia was affected I really cannot tell you, for she very ingeniously contrived to conceal her face the whole time; but she did not escape from the chapel without a visible crimson blush, which the tender Caroline very innocently occasioned. The gentlemen, as usual, paid their compliment to the bride; but, as soon as Seymour had touched her lip, this charming girl, who is perfectly the child of nature, dropt on her knee, and, kissing his hand, aid to him, with all the enthusiasm of simplicity and gratitude, "May Heaven, Sir, soon make you as happy as you have now made your two grateful dependents! I should deserve to lose the husband you have given me, if I de∣parted from the altar without uttering this pray∣er of my heart." Most of the party smiled at the native innocence and thankful en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgy of her devotion. Seymour raised and kissed her again in a rapture of reciprocal gratitude, while poor Cornelia was covered, not with one blush, but a succession of blushes; which I leave you, my dear Lucy, to interpret as you please. You, I know, will interpret them as a sort of silent counterpart to the audible prayer of Caroline. Why, good Heaven, was the prayer of so pure
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
and fervent a spirit to be rejected? Why was the well-deserved happiness of this excellent cou∣ple to be poisoned so cruelly just in its comple∣tion?—Poisoned it certainly is; for these good graceful creatures are too warmly attached to their benefactor, to enjoy even their union, now they find he is unhappy. He has indeed made himself completely so for the present, and perhaps for the rest of his days.</P>
<P>I am called from my paper to attend my hus∣band and our afflicted hostess. Adieu for some hours; I will resume my narration the first mo∣ment that I am at liberty.</P>
<P>I return to you, my dear Lucy, with a spirit both saddened and comfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by what I have been witness to since I quitted my pen You will join with me, I am sure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n loving my dear indul∣gent Audley still better, if possible, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an ever, when I tell you what pains he is taking to coun∣teract the horrid incidents of yesterday which I am still to relate to you. Before I enter upon them I must acquaint you that my husband has just p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Seymour into our chaise, to convey him in his present humiliated, yet still too fiery state of spirits, to a scene of solitude and friendship. They are to pass two days alone together at our house, and return to us on the third; this is a benevolent project of my husband's, from which he has great expectations; I am to remain here with my father, and to keep him, if possible, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt of silent neutrality, that we may all meet again without any discord; passing (to use my dear Audley's parliamentary phrase) an act of indemnity and oblivion. I most heartily wish
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
indeed that we could all swallow a cup of Lethe, and entirely forget the evening of yesterday. As soon as I have fulfilled my promise of impart∣ing to you in this pacquet the circumstances that have rendered it so detestable, I shall strive with all my spirit to banish them, not only from my own remembrance, but from that of our poor Cornelia, on whose tender bosom they have made the most deep and cruel impression; an impres∣sion which, if it is, as my father asserted, the provident work of Heaven, I must not expect, and I should not wish, to erase. But there is, as you and I have often agreed, a severity in his doctrine, to which I cannot immediately sub∣scribe. I was at first, indeed, most bitterly pro∣voked against Seymour: he ought to have been more on his guard at such a time and in such a place; yet such are the particulars of the case, that he seems to me much more entitled to com∣passion than to censure, and cannot help think∣ing it a barbarous fatality that made him wretch∣ed just at the season when the beneficent exer∣tion of his many virtues had given him the fair∣est title to happiness. It was the most trifling circumstance imaginable that produced all the mischief. You know, my father is no enemy to moderate festivity; or, as your brother said of him, he has a true priestly relish for an or∣thodox bottle. As our ill fortune would have it, he chanced, two days before our humble wed∣ding, to commend before Seymour some very rich and rare wine; its name I forget; it is not <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kay.</HI> Seymour recollected that he had a little store of it in his cellar, which a foreign am∣bassador
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
had presented to his father; and he in∣stantly resolved to produce a hamper of it at the wedding-dinner, and to honour the birth-day of the dear little Sedley. We all exclaimed against it as an impossibility; it could not arrive in time; no matter, it must be attempted: you know the foible of our hero; his ardent spirit pursues even a sportive whim of his fancy, as if it was a point on which the safety of an em∣pire depended. His favourite servant was sent off, and commanded to return with a hamper in a post-chaise by the time appointed. The fellow travelled day and night; but you know the great distance of Seymour's country-seat from this house. The expected wine did not arrive for the capital toasts after dinner; yet in the universal joy of the day it was hardly regretted. The evening came, and we were all sober and happy, though the gentlemen seemed a little elated by what they had drank. Cornelia, how∣ever, had drawn them from their bottles to her tea-table, to which, at my particular desire, the bride and bridegroom were admitted, for I was solicitous to save the modest Caroline from that jocular and coarse festivity which I knew would prevail in the lower part of the house: as it was, my father put her once out of countenance be∣fore us; it is strange that old men are always on these occasions more gross than young ones. Here, I must do him the justice to say, our fa∣vourite Seymour appeared to great advantage. His conversation, though very lively, was deli∣cate in the extreme; and thus far, indeed, it was a day of delight. It was now late in the
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
evening; but, just as the tea-table was removed, and preparation was making for a quiet game of cards, the fatal hamper arrived. Seymour in∣stantly exclaimed, Come, Doctor, you shall drink the health of the day in your favourite wine. Come, Monson, it would be barbarous to pin a bridegroom to a card-table, especially as it is high time for the ladies to begin undressing the bride. We will leave them to that ceremo∣ny, and drink to the general joy of the whole hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e below." With this festive exclamation he carried off my father to his wine, leading also young Sedley in his hand. He promised Cornelia, however, that he would only suffer the child to have a glass of the new wine, and restore him instantly to her care; a promise which he performed very faithfully, and in per∣son imprinting a kiss on the fair hand of the parent, in placing the charming but tired and sleepy boy on her bosom.</P>
<P>Would to Heaven he had taken as good care of himself! My heart felt a melancholy pre∣sage in the very moment when he seized my fa∣ther by the arm, and I gave my husband a cau∣tion to watch over them b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th; which he would certainly have done, had not a most unseasonable accident called him from the party. The happy Monson, who is as temperate as he is brave, could not be tempted beyond a second glass; after which, in spite of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir raillery, he stole away to the arms of his expecting Caroline. In a few minutes after he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t the company, my dear Audley was most unluckily intreated by the old Butler to terminate a foolish quarrel between
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
one of our servants and one of Cornelia's. This idle fray detained him much longer than he was aware, and on his return to the parlour he found Seymour and my father both flushed with wine, and both still more heated by argument, with the large Family Bible lying open between them; my father venting his indignation with great vehemence against the prophaneness of Seymour; and Seymour playing numerous and unutterable tricks of impious buffoonery. In vain did my dear Audley endeavour to put them into good humour with each other, and get them quietly to bed. Finding this impracticable, he con∣ceived a desperate project, of which you will hardly think him capable, but for which you will give him the more credit. This was, to make the two disputants completely drunk, that they might entirely forget what they had uttered against each other, and lose every trace of their religious dissention. He says, he thought him∣self supremely politic in this scheme, and was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tered with a momentary gleam of success; but Seymour, by an unfortunate allusion to the marriage in Cana, rekindled the furious zeal of my father, who, after uttering the bitterest re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ike to the young intoxicated infidel, quitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e room in a tempest of pious indignation. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mour, whose volatile spirits were now raised to the most frantic merriment, wanted first to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ain and then to follow him. This, however, my husband prevented, and by great exertions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his wild companion from exposing himself t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the servants. Alas! my dear Lucy, what a strange night of mingled joy and horror was
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
this! the different scenes of it are so deeply im∣pressed on my mind, that I think they can ne∣ver depart from my memory as long as I exist; and they will frequently appear as actually pas∣sing before me. But you are impatient for the sequel. Well; after a little pause, and a few deep sighs, I will proceed.</P>
<P>Cornelia and I had just attended the lovely bride to her chamber. We had received her last maidenly adieu! and left the charming agi∣tated gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in a sweet disorder of tremors, tender∣ness, and tears. From her room we had retired to that of Cornelia, where in two little beds on each side her own, and under one canopy, her beautiful boys lay, like two little angels, asleep. Our lovely friend, whose tender nerves had been much affected in taking leave of Caroline, seat∣ed herself at the feet of her bed, and looked, as I was saucy enough to tell her, like a more hap∣less heroine described by Rowe,
<Q>Warm, tender, full of wishes.</Q>
While I was rallying the gentle creature on her passion for Seymour, and the great chance he would have of success if he could press her to an immediate marriage at that moment; while the dear candid soul more than half confessed that I was right in reading the emotions of her heart; the door suddenly opened upon us, and in rushed my father, to warn the mistress of the mans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against harbouring such an impious wretched as Seymour under her roof</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="269"/>Think, my dear Lucy, what I endured at this moment; and paint to yourself the sweet countenance of our Cornelia, changing at once from the soft expression of tenderness, love, and hope, to the troubled looks of surprize, remorse, and despair. I endeavoured to hurry my father from her chamber; but he was not in a mood to be either wheedled or controuled. He was certainly a little inflamed by wine; yet his fa∣culties were rather quickened than impaired; and though he spoke with great austerity against the favourite object of our wishes, I must confess that I never heard him so eloquent in my life▪ He told Cornelia that, after the horrid blasphe∣mies to which he had been witness below, he should think himself deficient in his duty to earth and heaven, if he failed to caution her against the peril in which he saw her involved. He then represented the dangers of marrying a young man of strong passions, without a par∣ticle of religion, with such vehemence of lan∣guage, and force of imagery, that for my part I felt a cold horror strike through me, and poor Cornelia was thrown into sobs and tears.</P>
<P>When he perceived her weeping, he grew in∣finitely gentler in his manner, and, folding her hand within his, said, with a parental emotion, "I pity you from my soul: I see to what ex∣cess you love this alluring, this pernicious in∣fidel. And how could you do otherwise than love him? He is the most seducing of mortals▪ a man in who might easily tempt half your sex to make themselves the greatest of wretches! But con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, my dear lady, what dignity and firm∣ness
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
of character we have a right to expect from you. I will not argue the matter as a point of reason and judgment; but consult the best feel∣ings of sensibility; look at these little monitors (pointing to her children) and ask your own bosom if any partiality, any passion, however founded on the most dazzling of human attrac∣tions, can justify you to your own heart, if you give to these innocents for their example, their guide, their father, an absolute monster of im∣piety." The feeling mother was almost suffo∣cated by her tears on this pointed address to her maternal character. Perceiving that she had no power to speak, and wishing (to own the truth) that she should not find an opportunity, lest she should utter some precipitate resolution, for which we might all be sorry in a cooler moment; I ventured to argue with my father, at the im∣minent hazard of enraging him still more, in behalf of the dear abominable delinquent. I said, it was cruel to let a few words, however impious, uttered by an intoxicated man, cancel the merit of actions, not only splendid in point of generosity and courage, but distinguish∣ed by the true spirit of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ristian charity. In short, I was told in the defence of poor Sey∣mour, and did ample and affectionate justice to those virtues by which he has raised himself so high in our esteem. My father heard me with a degree of temper and patience that I did not expect. He did not once interrupt me; but He said, as soon as I pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed; "My dear Harriot, I do not blame you for looking with a fond and enthus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c admiration on the noble and cap∣tivating
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
accomplishments of this dangerous Sey∣mour; but, trust me, to marry a young man possessing all these attractions, and hiding under them a deep mass of impiety, is exactly like building a delightful palace in the tempting neighbourhood of Vesuvio. For a while you may be charmed with your situation; the air is delicious, the prospect enchanting; but a sudden and unexpected burst of the latent fire converts the gay residence of delusive security into a scene of the most terrific devastation, Believe me, there is nothing in the human cha∣racter, on which it is safe to build, but the solid rock of Religion." Encouraged by the mild∣ness with which my father had listened to me before, I attempted to moderate in some degree the austerity and intolerance of this maxim. By this attempt I unluckily rekindled his indigna∣tion; and he said to me in a very severe tone, "Harriot, you are the last person in the world who ought to appear as an advocate for Irreligion; have the gratitude and the decency to recollect, that all the rare happiness of your own life arises from my having given you a man of genuine piety for your husband." Then turning to Cornelia, he said, "Madam, you know how ardently I love my child: yet, I protest to you before God, I would rather have seen her sink into the grave in all the bloom of her youth and beauty, than I would have bestowed her on such a character as I am now endeavouring to caution you against." He added a short, but impassioned prayer, that his caution might
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
prove effectual; and then, giving us both his benediction, retired for the night.</P>
<P>As soon as we were alone, our lovely friend fell upon my neck, and wept most bitterly. She could not yet speak, but grasped my hand with the vehemence of a poor creature in agonies of pain. There was at this time a conflict in her heart and soul, more excruciating, perhaps, than any malad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of the body. She traversed her chamber with an agitated step; paused, look∣ed at her children, wept, and walked again. I tried to sooth her by making light of what had passed; by repre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enting it as a foolish dispute over a bottle, that would be utterly forgot the next day; but the lovely angel rebuked me with a look of displeasure, and exclaimed, "No, my dear Harriot, you must not any longer flat∣ter and confirm me in this criminal attachment. I do not vainly strive to hide from you with what excess of passion I love Seymour at this mo∣ment. Yes, I love him with that frenzy, that, if only the Perdition of my own soul was hazard∣ed by our union, perhaps I could not reject him; but for these dearer souls"—Here she cast her eyes again upon the sweet sleeping boys; her voice was suspended; but falling on her knee, at the feet of her own bed, so that she had an equal view of the two children, and raising to Heaven, perhaps, the most beaut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful and impassioned countenance that ever looked up to its Creator, she said, with a trembling voice, "By the Al∣mighty God who gave me the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e blessed infants, and by the dear saint whose dying injunction com∣mended them to my duty, I swear that no tempta∣tions
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
shall induce me to make the impious Sey∣mour their second father. I will never marry again." The last words she pronounced in a firmer and even a triumphant accent, for they were the dictates of duty and passion united. To sacrifice the man she doated on to Heaven was a resolve, which, though her mind was firm in its purpose, her lips could hardly utter; but to re∣nounce all the sex in honor of this dear victim, was a fond idea in which her heart exulted; it was granting, under the mask and yet with the sanction of duty, a secondary triumph to Love</P>
<P>Ah! my dear Lucy, do you not shudder at the thought of what our poor lovely friend must have to endure, either in keeping, or in violating this precipitate vow? For my part, I have the auda∣city, and I know, my good girl, you will sup∣port me in it, still to profess myself an advocate for this abominable offender. I cannot bear the idea of his being utterly renounced; and I main∣tain that not only Love and Friendship, but Re∣ligion itself ought to induce us all not to irritate and abandon, but to soothe him, and labour for his conversion. If we succeed, and from the gentle, firm, and persuasive spirit of my dear Audley, I have great hopes of success, the hasty vow of our dear righteous widow becomes void of course; we shall still be happy, and our happiness will be truly coelestial. I endeavoured to calm our dear Cornelia, by talking to her in this strain as soon as she had finished her adjuration; and, troubled as her spirit was, it did not turn with abhorrence from this kind of consolation. See, my dear Lucy, how well it is for a tender scrupulous sweet
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
soul, like our Cornelia, to have such kind con∣siderate commentators at her elbow as you and I are, when she is in the rash humour of vowing a vow! While I was administering to her the com∣fort which she found in seeing that her hasty pro∣mise to Heaven was conditional, I heard a gentle tap at her door. Behold my husband; "For Heaven's sake, said I, what have you done with Seymour? has not this fatal wine made him fran∣tic?" "Be not alarmed, returned my good man, looking keenly on the anxious eager coun∣tenance of Cornelia. He has, indeed, been a little disguised, by a slight excess in drinking: but this is not surprizing after his recent low regi∣men, and on such a day as this; his intemper∣ance only proves the affectionate warmth of his heart; it is now time for us all to retire, as I have put him very peaceably to bed." "Excellent, cried I, in a transport of joy, and now we may all sleep in peace." In saying this, I gave a sig∣nificant pressure to the hand of Cornelia, and we both wished her good night. And here, Lucy, I must take leave of you also with the same good wish. I can positively write no longer at present, but will resume my pen early to-morrow; so once more good night.</P>
<P>Not withstanding my presage that we should all sleep in peace, few mortals in health pass a night so sleepless on their pillow as we d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Corn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lia confessed to me the next day, that she had hardly closed her eyes; and as to Audley and my<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf, we were kept awake, find by talking over all the
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
wild vagaries and extravagancies of Seymour in his cups; and, secondly, by meditating on the best possible method of reconciling him and my father, and drawing good out of evil. I have al∣ready told you the project, my dear girl, which your incomparable brother has devised for this purpose. He rose early, awakened the poor un∣conscious culprit into a sense of his trespass in the preceding evening; and conveyed him from hence without his seeing either of the two persons who had most reason to he offended with his con∣duct. To both, however, he sent, at my husband's entreaty, and by his voice, a very humble and suppliant embassy; and particularly to my father, whom he requested to forget every syllable, if any such were uttered, in his intoxication, that could appear in any degree offensive or dis∣respectful to his character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Divine. To his gentle hostess he made the most tender apology; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, he felt himself unworthy to enjoy the de∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ht of seeing her the next day; but, as he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing to punish himself for his transgression by an immediate and self imposed banishment from her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ence, he trusted he should find her, on his return, more ready to pardon him than he was to forgive himself. You will easily guess how the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e messages were received by the two parties t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om they were addressed, as you know both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well. The tender widow said, that no apology <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> necessary to her: the rigid Divine declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> none was sufficient for him. I have had, in∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, a terrible task to keep the zeal o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my father wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in tolerable bounds: but after a long private scene of argument, intreaty, and tears, on my

part, I have prevailed on him to promise me that he will say nothing more to Cornelia on the sub∣ject at present. I have even brought him to ac∣quiesce in my opinion that the state of Seymour's affection, co-operating with the eloquence of my husband, may probably produce a very salu∣tary effect on the creed of this enchanting unbe∣liever.

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>YOU, who are so familiar with the past fol∣lies of my life, you, my dear Edmund, will not be surprized to hear that I have again played the fool more detestably than ever. I have made myself a wretch; I have disgraced myself in the eyes of my adored Cornelia. I am no longer under her roof. I have committed—but why should I particularize my execrable offences to you, when you have probably learnt (by means of the women who write about every thing) more circumstances of my misconduct than I know myself.</P>
<P>In foolish desire to ingratiate myself with that odious high priest Dr. Ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, who loves his bot∣tle pontifically, I drank with him, on a double festival that we have celebrated here, on the birth∣day of the brave little Sedley, and the marriage of my sweet Caroline, till the Doctor lost his temper, and I my senses. All I can remember of the evening is, that we sputtered much pious and pro∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ane nonsense in the face of each other. No∣thing could be so absurd; nothing so ill-timed; n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing so injurious to my love, as this execrable contention. I loath the sight of wine, and ab∣hor myself for my folly. Yet I have found an apologist and a comforter, where I little expected, and less perhaps deserved to find him; 'tis with peculiar satisfaction that I add—<HI>in your Brother.</HI>
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
He has kindly hurried me from a scene where I have exposed and disgraced myself so egregiously, to his own tranquil mansion; with a thoughtful good-nature that proved him really your brother. He suggested to me, that my best mode of apolo∣gizing for what I most bitterly repent, would be to withdraw for a few days, leaving only a conci∣liatory message for the persons who have the greatest right to be offended by my gross indeco∣rum. He observed, that by thus giving the in∣sulted Divine sufficient time to grow cool, I might probably induce him to forget our dispute; and by shewing Cornelia that I punish myself for my transg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession towards her by tearing myself from her presence, I should incline her to receive me with indulgence on my re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn. By the force of these friendly reasons, your brother drew me to his house; we have now been under his roof the better part of two days alone, and during that time his incessant attention and kind behaviour to me have been such, that I cannot more strongly express my sense of it to you, than by telling you the words I addressed to him a few minutes ago, on our closing a private conference of some hours. They were the word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a to Paul, "Almost thou p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are to be a Christian!"</P>

<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
has ever considered as a mixture of the unintelli∣gible and the ridiculous. I reverence, indeed, his ardent philanthropy, and I admire his happi∣ness, which is, as I freely allowed him, superior to what you and I have ever enjoyed, or may ever attain; but this, which he ascribes to his Religion, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the kind work of Nature; it is owing to the constitutional equipoise of his passions, and the peculiar felicity of his temper. He is a man whom superstition cannot spoil; and this, as I told him, is a grand panegyric; for the very best kind of superstition is apt to vitiate whatever it touches. I am not sure that even the pure, the tender, the generous bosom of my Cornelia her∣self can resist its influence.</P>
<P>At the instigation of that rigid and angry priest whom I have foolishly made my enemy, she may perhaps reject me for ever— reject the very man to whom she is, in truth, attached by affection, by gratitude, and every honest emotion of her frame. My soul is in tumult at this idea! I am conscious that I have deserved to experience some little portion of her anger. I want no Gospel to tell me, that intoxication is a beastly failing. I am ready to purchase her forgiveness, by re∣nouncing intemperance for ever; but I have too much noble pride to purchase even her person, though it is the only jewel in the world to my ap∣prehension, by making myself either a fool or a hypocrite. We return to morrow. How she will receive me I know not: but if she treats me with a coldness and disdain which I am sure are foreign to her nature, I feel it may drive me to distraction. Good heavens! to lose such a lovely

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI. FROM MR. AUDLEY TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I TRUST that my last letter convinced you, my dear Edmund, how sincerely my heart is disposed to promote the wishes of your engaging friend. His very failings have increased my at∣tachment to him, as they shew me, that, with a spirit peculiarly benevolent and generous to others, he is a most dangerous enemy to himself. My dear Harriot, who really feels for him all the so∣licitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a sister, has given you, I conclude, a very melancholy detail of the foolish and provok∣ing incidents they have produced a most uncom∣fortable change of scene in the house of Cornelia. I brought Seymour to pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few days with me in privacy, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der my own roof, for two reasons: first, I was very desirous to prevent the renewal, and, if possible, to annihilate the memory, of a furious theological dispute, which arose between him and Dr. Ayton, in a luckless night of intem∣perate
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
festivity. Secondly, I cherished a hope, that in the quiet of this sequestered scene, and in many successive hours of unreserved and friendly conversation, I might be fortunate enough to re∣move from the mind of this interesting young man the only obstacle to his happiness; I mean, that infidelity which seems to have fastened on his spirit, more from the power of accident than from any natural disposition in his character to produce or maintain it. It is with the most cordial concern I perceive, that my powers of ar∣gument and persuasion are too weak to accomplish in your friend, my dear Edmund, as in you, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppy conversion which I most ardently wish to behold in you both. I have searched as deeply as I could the springs of incredulity in each of you; and I find that these springs are very different; but, ala! they are equally powerful against my wish in your behalf. Rousseau, I think, has said, that the faith of most men is regulated upon earth by their temporal interest. This, however, is by no means the case with an English gentleman of independent fortune, whose creed has little connexion with his temporal prosperity, that many parents in this rank of like, while they teach worldly maxims to their children, think it unnecessary to burthen them with religious ideas. Thus young men are left to pick up such a religion as Time and Chance may happen to afford them. Their faith, of course, will greatly depend on their early connexions in life, and still more on their particular humours and passions. I think, my dear Edmund, that this remark is very strongly exemplified in you and your friend

Seymour: in you, as I have often told you, infi∣delity is the offspring of a vitiated imagination: in Seymour, it is the child of an imperious passion, and, I fear, the firmest of passion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, pride. It pleased Heaven to give you, with a strong under∣standing, a much greater propensity to ridicule and sarca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m than is commonly united to a heart so tender as yours; the applause very justly given to your early wit and humour augmented this dangerous pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pensity; thus your mind was allur∣ed into the habit of considering even the most serious objects in a lud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crous point of view; your first associates in the world were unfortu∣nately men who trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Christianity with deris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on; you were amused in laughing with them, and pleased to increase their merriment by your supe∣rior vivacity. But as the fire of youth abated, your natural good sense, my dear Edmund, soon taug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t you, on these articles, a great degree of caution and reserve; you ceased to ridicule Re∣ligion; but though prudence and good nature conspired to make you desist from a practice which you could not pursue without creating to yourself many enemies, you could not correct the internal mischief which the habit, too long in∣dulged, had impressed upon your mind. You could, indeed, cease to ridicule Religion; but you could not cease to think Religion ridiculous. The bias given to your youthful fancy was too powerful for your reason, even in its maturity, to counteract; and how many men have we seen unable, in advanced life, to embrace the com∣forts of genuine piety, from no other cause but the having been idly tempted to laugh at them in their youth! It is difficult in
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
the highest degree to bring the human spirit to contemplate with reverence what it has once been accustomed to treat with derision; and as to yourself, my dear Edmund, I am convinced, as I have often said to you, by my own ineffec∣tual but affectionate endeavours to change the cast of your mind, that nothing but some great and unexpected calamity or sickness; nothing, in short, but some striking event, that may con∣vulse, as it were, like an earthquake, your whole bodily and intellectual frame, can take from your warped imagination that unfortunate bent which I have so frequently lamented. With your friend Seymour I had flattered myself on a prospect of better success: as his mind has not been so much under the fascination of ridicule, I hoped to find it more open to Reason. I was willing to think that even his passions might act as my confede∣rates; and that Love, which has settled, as you sportively said, the creed of many princes, might help me to make a happy convert of him; but Love, I find, in its warmest excess, is a passion much weaker than Pride; at least it proves so in your friend. He doats upon Cornelia; but, with a firmness of proud incredulity which I both la∣ment and admire, he will not purchase even the idol of his heart by what he considers a sacrifice of his own dignity as a man; nay, so tenacious is he of imaginary honour in this point, that if my long and repeated conferences had really convert∣ed him, he says he should be almost tempted to suppress his belief at this juncture, lest his friends should suppose that Love had made him an hypo∣crite in Religion: so vehement is his detestation to every shadow of duplicity and falshood.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="284"/>It is impossible not to love a character so open, so ingenuous, so ardent, and so firm, however deluded he may be: it is equally impossible (at least for a man who t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nks seriously of Religion), not to wish him possessed of only thing which can render his enchanting qualities no longer dan∣gerous to himself. You, my dear brother, have both experience and discretion, I might even say timidity, in the conduct of life, to protect you against the perils of your own foibles and passions; but it is not so with our friend: undi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guised in all he thinks, and precipitate in all he does, he is peculiarly exposed to the malice of fortune; and the more I reflect on his present situation, the more I am alarmed for what is to come.</P>
<P>As to myself, he has reduced me to a most un∣comfortable dilemma: I cannot take an active part in opposing his wishes, without wounding, not only my friendship for you, but those sentiments of regard with which he has inspired me for himself. Nor can I be very earnest and decisive in promot∣ing his hopes of marrying Cornelia, consistently with my conscience. I have the sincerest good wishes to them both; I clearly perceive they are so deeply enamoured of each other, that they must be wretched asunder; yet, if they are united, there is a prospect of equal, and perhaps of superior wretchedness, from their unhappy difference▪ the great article of Religion: an ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cle which the dying injunction of poor Sedley h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s rendered so pecul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arly imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtant to Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elia, that I question induce if Seymour, with the united powers of Love and Friendship, with his own attractions, and my recommendation (if I
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
dared to recommend him) could triumph, with∣out a change in his creed, over the scrupulous piety of my lovely ward. I am almost convinced that she would perish in those wasting maladies which are apt to arise from vehement disappoint∣ed affection, much rather than gratify her heart by a violation of her duty; yet a woman, a tender, young, and impassioned woman, is, we all know, a frail creature; and perhaps I ought to take the most determinate steps to secure the gentle being, bequeathed to my care, from a trial so perilous and severe.</P>
<P>I am truly bewildered by the various vexations, perplexities, and dangers on every side. I feel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owever, that my mind has gained some little re∣lief in thus copiously unburthening itself to you. I am sure you will be ready to co-operate with me in what I most wish at present, which is, to keep Seymour as quiet as possible; any precipi∣tate importunity in his addresses just now would be very cruel to Cornelia, and must, I think, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulvous to himself. He appears not a little affect∣ed by the sincerity of my zeal for his happiness, and he promises to be guided in a great measure, as to his present conduct, by me; but I perceive the im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etuosity of his spirit, and am perfectly aware that it will be very difficult to keep him from acting according to the sudden and acciden∣tal impulse of his imperious passion. As you are the only person in the world possessing long and confirmed influence over this impetuous youth, pray let your letters to him be persuasive lessons of tranquillity and patience. By gaming time, we may do much for his good. I should tell you,
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
he has made one generous and important con∣cession; he has promised, that, if he marries Cornelia, all her children shall be educated as devoutly as she and I may think proper. He will never interfere with the religion of his own wife or her family. He even thinks they may be much the happier for being good Christians; yet, so in∣consistent are men, they will take no pains to eradicate from their own minds those early habits and prejudices which have hardened them against a faith, whose beneficial influence on the happi∣ness of its true professors they candidly acknow∣ledge.</P>
<P>But, lest you should think I am giving you a sermon without end, my dear Edmund, I will only add, that we return to-morrow to Sedley-hall; and that I propose on the following day to remove the whole party to my house; for which I have an excellent plea, in the visit I expect from my dear Harriot's lively niece, Louisa Mountmaurice, who is coming to pass a month with us, and coming as she says in a saucy note that I found from her here, with a resolution to rob the lovely widow of her wounded knight, and make a conquest of the gallant Seymour for herself.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII. FROM SEYMOUR TO EDMUND AUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD me, dear Edmund, restored to Sedley-hall; and my good genius himself seemed to hail my return, in the shape of a ser∣vant, who informed me, as your brother and I alighted at the door, that Dr. Ayton is gone to London. I could not help exclaiming, in the words of Madeth,
<Q>Being gone, I am myself again.</Q>
In sober truth, I greatly dreaded a second meet∣ing with this stiff piece of orthodox austerity. I neither chose to play the servile penitent, or the hypocrite, with him; nor to let him play the insolent school-master and tyrannical bigot with me. I thank my stars, that the tidings of a tottering more have hurried him to the metro∣poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that he may watch it as the witch does the drop on the corner of the moon, and "catch it ere it fall to the ground."</P>
<P>My dear indulgent Cornelia has received me with that graceful gentleness which is so peculiar to herself; and she made so kind a reply to my repeated apology for my late transgression, that, as I told her, I felt the various pains that I have suffered from my folly delightfully repaid in the sweetness of her pardon. There is indeed a de∣licacy
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
in the manners of Cornelia, which I never found in those of any other woman, and which is the result of her genuine, unaffected, and temperate sensibility. The whole sex may, I think, be comprehended in two classes, the live∣ly and the serious; the first often overwhelm us by their vivacity, and the second by their gloom. But Cornelia is a perfect model of the true hap∣py medium. Her gaiety is as mild and benig∣nant as the smile of an angel; and her melan∣choly, instead of diffusing sadness, inspires only tenderness and love. Such she has appeared to me on the many, many reflections which I have made in various humours on this incomparable woman: yet I must add with sorrow, that al∣though her first reception of me was enchant∣ingly gracious, and perfectly like herself, in some moments since my return I have thought I perceived a new character creeping like a mist over her mind. Her native ease has now and then changed into a cold and stately politeness, that struck like a falling isicle on my bosom, and seemed both to lacerate and to petr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy my heart. I could not help whispering to her, though there was company in the room, "If you treat me with an air of proud indifference, you will very soon make a madman of me for life." I believe she was both vexed and pleased by this intimation; it had certainly a happy influence on her b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>iour and my feelings; for she never spoke to me afterwards but with such a softness of voice that the tones of it sunk into my soul. Oh, Edmund, this dear delicious woman must
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
be mine, or my life will not be worth preserv∣ing!</P>
<P>What has passed in our short absence I have not yet learned; as I have only had a few en∣couraging looks from my very good friend Mrs. Audley, and a brief exhortation from her not to be precipitate, but resign myself to Hope and Heaven. She is an indulgent kind creature; and she has been, I understand, very warm in my defence, at the hazard of incurring her righ∣teous father's displeasure. Yet, much as she is my friend, I cannot depend on her imparting to me explicitly all that I want to know. But I have one sure channel of intelligence. As soon as I can get my grateful Caroline alone, I am confident that her gratitude will induce her to reveal to me all the secrets of the female cabinet, to which I know she is admitted. It is fortunate for me, that she and her happy Monson are to return with us and the ladies to your brother's. He has kindly insisted on carrying us all to his own hospitable mansion to-morrow, where he expects to find a niece of Mrs. Audley's from Ireland, a lovely girl, they say, and wonderfully like Cornelia in form and shape of her features, but not so in the expression of her countenance, since vivacity is the characteristic of one, and tenderness of the other. Mrs. Audley has been jesting with me, concerning the beauties of her niece, and a design, which she sportively ascribes to her, of making a conquest of me. By Hea∣ven, I thought that Cornelia, who overheard part of our discourse without our intending it, turned pale at the sound! O Venus ! if this soft
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
creature should really love me well enough to grow seriously jealous of a young Irish hoyden! if she does, I defy the devil himself, and a legion of his love-thwarting priests, to keep us asunder. But I must bid you very hastily adieu. Indeed I should not have written till we are all comfortably settled for a few weeks at Audley Grove, had I not thought you would be parti∣cularly anxious for an account of my reception from the dear offended hostess of this mansion. I was eager also to inform you of the seasonable departure of the odious high-priest, and the prospect, or rather the glimpse I have, of new and exquisite delight, under the friendly roof of your brother. Among all the joys of an enrap∣tured heart there can be none superior to that of raising a sweet impassioned woman, whose fond imagination has plunged her in the torments of jealous terror, to the paradise of tranquil and confident affection. Farewell; and fail not to wish that the joy which I anticipate in my fancy, may soon be actually possessed by</P>

The bewitching offender is returned, and received, and forgiven; whether my good man has brought him back to us exactly what we wish, I cannot inform you, as we have had no time for private conversation, and I write in great haste, to tell you we are all preparing to decamp. My niece Louisa is by this time at Audley Grove; and our whole party is to ad∣journ to our house, for the better reception of this charming sprightly girl, who has at length obtained the permission of her father to pass a few months with us.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. FROM EDMUND AUDLEY TO SEYMOUR.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letters, my dear Seymour, have acted as med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cine upon my spirits in the course of an illness into which I have relapsed, and from which I am once more recovered. Sometimes indeed the medicine was too strong for the patient; and at one period my anxiety for you, and my terrors of Dr. Ayton, considerably increased the nervous fever, which has proved such an obstinate enemy to my health and comfort. But the high-priest's most season∣able departure, and the very cordial regard which I am now doubly assured my brother has conceived for you, inspire me with salutary and enlivening hopes. I clearly perceive that the capricious Goddess Good-fortune is hastening to embrace you, and complete your happiness. Do not, I conjure you, in your impetuous eagerness to meet her, beat the fair Divinity backwards, and overset all her intended bounty.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="294"/>You find me, as usual, still ready to load you with cautionary counsel; and in truth, my dearest friend, I never knew any period in your event∣ful life, where I saw greater reason, or felt a more anvi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us desire, to throw a gentle curb over the native precipitancy of your spirit. Indeed, in proportion as you have advanced in that path which is to lead, I trust, to happiness, I have felt more and more solicitous, lest one hasty false step should prevent your reacting the object of your ambition. You are now happily advanced so far, that if you will but trust patiently to Time, he will complete your wishes; and believe me, however nonsens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cally it may sound to you both in expression and sentiment, to stand still is your surest was to get forward. You have gained the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eart of the woman you love; you have gained the friendship of the man whose situati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and allow me to say, whose virtues give him a fair ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to influence her conduct, but, justly regard as you are by both, they are both very full of certain apprehensions concer∣ning you; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by any rash and passionate attempts to accelerate the event for which you are so eager, you increase and exasperate these appre∣hensions, the cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quence must be universal wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to us all; but if, on the other hand, you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with the generous forbearance that I am now a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dently recommending to you, their fears will gradually evap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate; you will appear to them the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sinterested, affect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onate, and generous being which you really are; your success must be inevitable, since you have no rivals to appre∣hend;
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
and, in thus securing your own happi∣ness, you will make us all happy.</P>
<P>I could wish that my good brother had been successful in his very zealous endeavours for your conversion. Since it is otherwise, allow me to suggest to your reflection how far it may be con∣sistent, I will not say with prudence, for I know you despise that cold-blooded quality; but with love, honour, and generosity, to assume an ap∣pearance of that creed which your mistress and your friend have so affectionately wished to im∣press upon your mind. It is needless, I trust, to assure you, that I have an abhorrence as vehe∣ment as your own for all the arts of a sordid and selfish hypocrisy. But when dissimulation is practised for no purpose but to ensure the tran∣quility and happiness of those we love, it ought surely to lose the name and character of baseness, and to be ranked among the noblest of virtues; it is then that we may speak of falshood in the spi∣rited language of Tasso, and justly say,
<Q><L>Magnarima mersogna! or quando è il ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o</L>
<L>Si belle, che si possa a te preporte!</L></Q>
<Q>Magnanimous falshood! when is truth so beautiful as to merit the preference to thee!</Q></P>
<P>I quote an Italian poet, to shew you that I have not utterly neglected your injunction con∣cerning that language; though I reproach myself for not having learned it, as I ought to have done, in the happier days of Giuliana.</P>
<P>Were I in your situation, I should find a mar∣vellous delight in cherishing such an affectionate illusion in the mind of my mistress. I should
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
exult in persuading her that she had made me every thing she wished; how charming must it be, to gratify the fond pride of her soul in mak∣ing her believe that by the tenderness which ministered to your earthly pleasure she was literal∣ly leading you to Heaven! How exquisite must the soft features of your Cornelia appear, when animated with the mingled fire of triumphant piety and gratified affection! Trust me, my dear Seymour, those happy rogues (whether hypo∣crites or not) have had the keenest enjoyment of women, who have had the art to mix Devo∣tion with Love. I cannot say I have great hopes of your regarding my suggestions to you on this subject; for I know yon have such a romantic attachment to truth, that you would rather make yourself miserable for life, by adhering to it, than condescend t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be usefully and even ge∣nerously deceitful. What a pity it is that the most obstinate votaries are those of imaginary virtue!</P>
<P>I can easily conceive how you would exult in raising a little jealous apprehension in the soft bosom of Cornelia; but have a care, my good friend; do not, by attempting to waken jealousy in one tender heart, inadvertently throw an amorous flame into another. You are too dan∣gerous a fellow to trifle with an artless and glow∣ing girl of eighteen. Though Louisa Mount∣maurice, from the peculiar sprightliness of her character, might be more able to defend her heart against your insinuating attractions than the making Cornelia; yet pray remember that this niece of your good friend Harriot is com∣posed,
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
like the rest of her sex, of combustible atoms; and do not suffer your Cupid to shake his torch too near her. As to the advantages you seem to expect from making Cornelia jea∣lous, I have many doubts on that article: doubt, you know, is the characteristic of my mind, and decision of yours. I think much evil might arise from it, and a consequence directly opposite to what your quick fancy has suggested. But I will not pester you with all the thorny conjectures on a contingency that will hardly happen. I must, however, inform you what your very zealous friend Lucy says on your idea; she entreats you, whatever degree of pleasure or influence you may expect to derive from it, ne∣ver to pursue so barbarous an expedient. She says, what I am convinced is strictly true, that your fair-one's heart is already as entirely yours as Love can make it; and why should you cruel∣ly fill it with agonies that cannot encrease its affection? Lucy goes so far as to affirm, that your tender widow has not strength of mind or body sufficient to support the pangs of the most e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teruc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ating passion; and if you make her really jealous in the present perplexed state of her spi∣rits, you must inevitably destroy either her life or her senses. Though I do not quite subscribe to this fearful idea of my sister's, I cannot help joining her in conjuring you to be cautious. Be assured, my dearest friend, that if you will be but temperate and patient, if you will only al∣low sufficient time for that Love which is certain∣ly the predominant passion of her soul, to subdue and expel the terror that yet adheres to it, you
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
will soon make her your wife upon the terms that are most agreeable to your own manly spirit. I am apprised of the generous proposals which you have made to my brother concerning the educa∣tion of her children; and, trust me, both your queen and her honest privy-counsellor will (if you do not perplex them with your precipitancy) acquiesce in this desirable union, on the ground you propose. But their acquiescence must be the work of deliberation and of time. I will now release you from this tedious lecture; but let me once more repeat our entreaty, for I speak both in Lucy's name and my own, that you will not make yourself wretched by too great an eager∣ness to be happy. Pardon the prolixity of your timid, affectionate preceptor; and believe me</P>
