<SPEAKER>Constance.</SPEAKER>
<P>LISETTE, Lisette, who do you think I have just seen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your old guardian I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think I should look thus pleasant if it was <HI>he</HI> I meant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who then, our jailor who keeps the keys?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>What poor Jeffrey, ha, ha, ha!—how you talk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I guess who you mean, the young Marquis De Lancy, and he has passed so frequently under your window within these few days, that I am amazed your guardian, with all his suspicions, has not observed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has walked by above ten times within this hour, and every time with his eyes fixed up to the lattice of my window, and I had no heart to remove from it, for every time he saluted me with the most respectful bow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was his valet with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I saw another person in deep con∣versation with him, a strange looking man, who appeared like one of the faculty, for his dress very much resembled that of my guardian's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who wou'd it be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what most surprised me, he had a let∣ter in his hand, which he respectfully held up to me; but I could not reach it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know who it is—La Fluer, valet to the Marquis, disguised as a doctor, and I have no doubt but under that disguise he will find means to intro∣duce himself to your old guardian, and perhaps be brought into the very house, and if I can assist his scheme I will; for is it not a shame the doctor should dare here in Paris to forbid both you and your ser∣vant to stir from home; lock us up, and treat us as women are treated in Spain.</P>
<STAGE>(with anger)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind, Lisette, don't put yourself in a passion, for we can learn to plot and deceive, and treat him as men are treated in Spain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Madam, and to prove I am not less inclined than yourself to Spanish manners, I am as much in love as you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not with the Marquis?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think I don't know better where it is my duty to love? I am in love with his man—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I knew the contents of that letter he held out to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you are beloved—admired, I can tell every word in it—I know every sentence as well as if I had read it—and now, madam, it is my ad∣vice, you sit down and answer it directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I have read it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, give your answer at the time you receive his letter—consider how convenient it will
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
be to give the one, while you take the other—we are so watched you know, that we ought to let no opportunity pass, for fear we should never get ano∣ther, and therefore when he finds means to send his letter, you must take the same to return yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my guardian should even know I had written to a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll write for you—and should there be any discovery the letter will be in my hand writing, not yours—we must lose no time—the Doctor is abroad at present, and it must be both written and delivered before his return.</P>
<STAGE>(She sits at the table, and begins to write.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my dear Lisette—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't put me out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are you saying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(writing)</STAGE>
<P>What you are thinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't know my thoughts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do—And here they are in this letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me look at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No don't examine your thoughts, I beg you won't <STAGE>(solds the letter and rises)</STAGE> besides, you have no time to read it, I must run to the garden gate and deliver it immediately—the worst difficulty is, ha∣ving for near an hour to supplicate this poor simple decrepit'd fool of the old Doctor's to open me the garden gate for a moment.</P>
<STAGE>(Jeffrey calls.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Doctor has lately appointed Jeffrey his apothecary—he is busy preparing of medicines and will be angry at being disturb'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter—it may save the life of some of his Master's patients.</P>
<STAGE><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<HI>Enter</HI> JEFFREY, <HI>a bandage on his left Eye and one on his right Leg.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>You made me overthrow the whole decoction</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great Apothecary!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>And alone worthy the physician under whom you have received instructions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry I overthrew the decoction, for it was for my use—my leg is in pain still, and I am not yet satisfied the dog was not mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you I am sure he was not, and had you suffer'd him to live it would have prov'd so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>My master order'd me to kill him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merely to make you believe he was mad, and to shew his skill by pretending to preserve you from the Infection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, don't speak against my master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who was it undertook to cure your eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>He, and thank heaven, Lisette, I shall not suffer any more from that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then do you wear a bandage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>To hide the place where it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it thus the Doctor cured you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was so kind to put my left eye out, in order to save the right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well still you are more fortunate than the God of Love, for he has no eyes at all—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I shallhave two very soon, for my mas∣ter has promis'd me to buy me one at the great ma∣nufactory, which will be much handsomer than either of my other—a very handsomer glass one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if the Doctor will remake you thus
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
piece by piece, in time my dear Jeffrey, you may become a very pretty man—but you know Jeffrey, I love you even as you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love me—that's a good joke—Lisette, I am afraid you want something of me, you speak to me so plesantly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Want something of you—how cou'd such an idea enter your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because when you don't want something of me, you huff me, and cuff me,—from morning to night, eh, eh! you look no more as you do now, why if I was dying, I durst hardly speak to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well henceforward you shall have no reason to complain. But do you know Jeffrey, I have a little-favour to ask of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! I thought so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Jeffrey, we will make you any recompence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you want, if I can do it without offending my master I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you don't tell him, he'll never know it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell him every thing—he pays me my wages for telling—and I must not take them with∣out earning them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>If money is of such value to you, here take my purse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>No it is not money I want, it is something else</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I won't tell him of that I protest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, Jeffrey what is your favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just one salute of Mrs. Lisette.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, if that's all, after you have oblig'd us, you shall have twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I had rather have one now, than the twenty you promise after.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me what it is?</P>

<P>To give us the key of the garden gate.</P>

<P>Why not?</P>

<P>For several reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place I have not got the key—my master took it with him when he went out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know you tell a falschood, he has not got it—is this your bargain and your gratitude—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay if you are angry at that give me the kiss again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ugly, foolish, yet artful and cunning wretch, leave the room, you make love to me indeed? Why I always hated you, laugh'd at you, and despised you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jef.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know that—did not I tell you when you spoke so kindly to me you wanted something, how then could you expect me to oblige you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I shall ever detest the sight of you.</P>

<P>My dear Lisette, If our two lovers, the Marquis and his Servant, prove no more fortunate in their schemes, than we have been in ours, I fear, I must according to his desire, marry the Doctor—and you Jeffrey.</P>

<P>What an indignity—I can't put up with it—I can't bear it—I'm ready to choak with passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir what is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am disgraced, ruined and undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what has caused it Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A conspiracy of the blackest kind—man's weakness is arrived to its highest summit; and there is nothing wanting but merit, to draw upon us the most cruel persecution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I understand—the faculty have been conspiring against you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have refused to grant me a diploma—forbid me to practice as a physician, and all because I don't know a parcel of insignificant words; but exercise my profession according to the rules of <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>nature;</HI> Is it not natural to die, then if a dozen or two of my patients have died under my hands, is not that natural?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very natural indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But thank heaven, in spite of the scandalous
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
reports of my enemies I have this morning nine visits to make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir, a young ward has sent for you to attend his guardian—three nephews have sent for you to attend their uncles, very rich men—and five husbands have sent for you in great haste to attend their wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not that a sign they think what I can do—is it not a sign they have the highest opinion of my skill, and the faculty shall see I will rise supe∣rior to their machinations—I have enter'd upon a project, that I believe will teaze them—I have made overtures to one of their profest enemies, a man whom they have crushed, and who is the chief of a sect just sprung up, of which perhaps, you never heard, for simply by the power of Magnetism they can cure any ill, or inspire any passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—and every effect is produced upon the frame, merely by the power of the Magnet, which is held in the hand of the physican, as a wand of a conjuror is held in his, and it produces wonders in physic equally surprising.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will you become of this new sect.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
You know Doctor, their is an universal fluid which spreads throughout all nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fluid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Fluer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a fluid—which is—a—fluid—and you know, Doctor that this fluid—generally called a fluid, is the most subtile of all that is the most subtle—Do you understand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Fluer.</SPEAKER>
<P>It ascends on high, <STAGE>(looking down)</STAGE> and descends on low, <STAGE>(looking up)</STAGE> penetrates all sub∣stances, from the hardest metal, to the softest bosom—you understand me I precieve?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Fluer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give you a simile then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be much oblig'd to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Fluer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This fluid is like a river—You know what a river is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Fluer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This fluid is like a river, that—that—runs—that—goes—that—gently glides—so—so—so—while there is nothing to stop it.—But if it en∣counters a mound or any other impediment—boo—boo—boo—it bursts forth—it overflows the coun∣try round—throws down villages, hamlets, houses, trees, cows and lambs; but remove obstacles which obstruct its course, and it begins again, softly and sweetly to flow—thus—thus—thus—the fields are again adorned, and every thing goes on, as well as it can go on.—Thus it is with the <HI>Animal</HI> Fluid, which fluid obeys the command of my art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprising art! but what are the means you employ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>La Fluer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merely gestures—or a simple touch—</P>

<P>Astonishing! give me some proof of your art directly, do satisfy my curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Fluer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will,—and by holding this wand, in which is a Magnet, in a particular position, I will so direct the fluid, that it shall immediately give you the most exeruciating rheumatism which will last you a couple of hours — I will then change it to the gout—then to strong convulsions—and after into a raging fever, &amp; in this manner shall your curiosity become satisfied</P>

<P>Nay, Doctor, reflect upon the arts you made use of, to keep my Constance yours, even in spite of her inclination, then do not comdemn the artifice I employed to obtain her, with her own consent. A reward like this urged me to encounter every ha∣zard and every danger. For believe me doctor there is no Magnetism, like the powerful Magnetism of Love.</P>
