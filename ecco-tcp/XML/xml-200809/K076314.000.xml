<STAGE>A Myrtle-Grove with a Fountain belonging to <HI>Anaxander's</HI> Palace.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Amalintha</HI> and <HI>Phila.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>WHY had not I a barb'rous <HI>Spartan</HI> Soul,</L>
<L>Unapt for Love, and harsh, as our rude Customs!</L>
<L>Or why, ye cruel Fates! did you deny</L>
<L>My Birth to be among the neighb'ring Swains,</L>
<L>Where, on the flow'ry Banks of smooth <HI>Panisus</HI></L>
<L>I might have fat, and heard the gentle Vows</L>
<L>Of some protesting Shepherd, uncontroul'd!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phila.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas on those fatal Plains, I well re∣member,</L>
<L>That first your Eyes encounter'd with <HI>Aristor</HI>'s.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, in a Chace we met, when Truce allow'd it,</L>
<L>Where the young Prince, whom I too much had mark'd</L>
<L>Thro' all the graceful Toils of that blest Day,</L>
<L>Redeem'd my Life, with Hazard of his own,</L>
<L>From the chaf'd Boar, that now had almost seiz'd me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phila.</SPEAKER>
<L>When I arriv'd the first of all your Train,</L>
<L>I heard you thank him for the gen'rous Rescue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>I did; yes <HI>Phila,</HI> with my Heart I thank'd him,</L>
<L>And paid it down a Ransom for my Life:</L>
<L><PB N="334" REF="341"/>
Since when, how often in this Place we've met,</L>
<L>And with what Pleasure, thou alone can'st tell,</L>
<L>The only Friend, and witness of our Passion.</L>
<L>But, prithee go, and keep off all Intruders,</L>
<STAGE>[Exit <HI>Phila.</HI></STAGE>
<L>Whilst with my Sorrows now I tread this Grove,</L>
<L>Which shou'd not thrive, when all our Hopes are blasted.</L>
<STAGE>[She walks into the Grove.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>From the other Door, the <HI>Fox</HI> runs over the Stage, follow'd soon after by <HI>Aristomenes,</HI> his Hands foul with Earth.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>Farewell my wild Companion, and my Leader! <STAGE>[Pointing to the <HI>Fox.</HI></STAGE></L>
<L>Henceforth thy figure, in my Ensigns borne,</L>
<L>Shall tell the World (if e'er I 'scape these Walls)</L>
<L>That 'twas thy Conduct drew me from my Bondage.</L>
<L>How fair this Grove appears to my loath'd Dun∣geon!</L>
<STAGE>[He sees the Fountain.</STAGE>
<L>Oh! welcome to my Sight, thou gentle Spring!</L>
<L>Ne'er did'st thou cool a Thirst, that rag'd like mine:</L>
<L>I bow my Knees upon thy mossy Brim,</L>
<STAGE>[He kneels and lays his Mouth to the Stream.</STAGE>
<L>And, as they drank, ere Art had worsted Nature,</L>
<L>Draw thy refreshing Stream to my scorch'd Entrails.</L>
<STAGE>[Drinks agen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></STAGE>
<L>Again, O Nectar, most delicious!</L>
<L>This favour more, and then I quit thy Borders.</L>

</SP>
<STAGE>Re-enter <HI>Amalintha.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! 'tis all dismal, now that Love is absent,</L>
<L>Faded the Flow'rs, and with'ring ev'ry Branch:</L>
<L><PB N="335" REF="342"/>
Whilst thro' the Leaves the sad, and sighing Winds,</L>
<L>Methinks, all say, the Hours of Bliss are past;</L>
<L>And here, we ne'er shall meet each other more.</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>Aristom.</HI> comes towards her.</STAGE>
<L>Ha! what Intruder do my Eyes behold?</L>
<L>A Stranger, and invade my private Walks,</L>
<L>The Doors too all secur'd! Tell how you came.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>As comes the Mole, by painful work∣ing upwards,</L>
<L>Will the sweet Air beat on my clammy Brows.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>There's something mystical in what you utter;</L>
<L>Which (tho' offended with your Presence here)</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wou'd be glad farther to have Unriddl'd.</L>

<L>This be my Guard; and now you may proceed,</L>
<L>And, if you dare, discover who you are.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'd not deny my Name, to 'scape that Dungeon, <STAGE>[Pointing behind the Scenes.</STAGE></L>

<STAGE>[She looks about.</STAGE>
<L><PB N="336" REF="343"/>
Nay, look not round; for if you fear you wrong me,</L>
<L>I wou'd not injure you, to gain my Safety.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nor wou'd I fail to help you to secure it,</L>
<L>For all that <HI>Lacedemon</HI> holds most Precious.</L>
<L>I gaz'd about, lest any were in sight,</L>
<L>That might prevent my dear Design to save you.</L>
<L>Support me, as I walk, like one that serv'd me,</L>
<L>And when they have unlock'd that Postern-door,</L>
<L>I'll give you some Command before the Guard,</L>
<L>Which to perform they shall admit your Passage.</L>
<L>Or this must force it, if your evil Stars</L>
<STAGE>[Gives him her Dagger.</STAGE>
<L>Have plac'd such there, as know and wou'd detain you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>As long as Life, I'll proudly wear this Favour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! haste, my Lord, lose not this precious moment.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, stay; and ere I take one step tow'rds Freedom,</L>
<L>Let me be told, to whose blest Aid I owe it;</L>
<L>And how I may discharge so vast a Debt:</L>
<L>Tho' I, and all that's dear to me shou'd perish,</L>
<L>I wou'd not stir, 'till satisfy'd in this.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Know then, my Lord—</L>
<L>Tho' whilst I speak, I tremble for your Danger,</L>
<L>That to declare my Name, might work my Ruin:</L>
<L>But since such Gratitude crowns your great Virtues,</L>
<L>I have a Blessing to implore from you,</L>
<L>When the full Time shall ripen and reveal it;</L>
<L>Harder, I fear, to grant, and much more dear</L>
<L><PB N="337" REF="344"/>
Than what I now assist you to preserve.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>By Liberty, which none like me can value,</L>
<L>By new-recovered Light, and what it shews me,</L>
<L>Your brighter Form, with yet a fairer Mind,</L>
<L>By all the ties of Honour, here I swear;</L>
<L>Be that untouch'd, and your Request is granted.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of you, my Lord, and of the list'ning Gods</L>
<L>I ask no more—but, that you haste to 'scape:</L>
<L>Without that Camp the open Champain lies.</L>
<L>May Fortune, which the hardest Part has done,</L>
<L>Crown her great Work, and lead you safely on!</L>
<STAGE>[Exit <HI>Aristom,</HI> leading her.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Phila</HI> weeping.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phila.</SPEAKER>
<L>What shall I say, or how reveal this to her?</L>
<L>Is't not enough, ye Gods, we bear our own,</L>
<L>That thus you suffer the vain trifler <HI>Love</HI></L>
<L>To bring the Griefs of others too upon us!</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Amalintha</HI> returns.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! <HI>Phila,</HI> I such Tydings have to tell thee,</L>
<L>But thou hast chill'd them in a Moments space</L>
<L>With that cold dew that trickles from thine Eyes.</L>
<L>Is not <HI>Aristor</HI> safe?—</L>
<L>Thou say'st he is not, in that weeping silence:</L>
<L>But lives he yet? if this thou do'st not answer,</L>
<L>My Death shall free thee from all farther Questions.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="338" REF="345"/>
<SPEAKER>Phila.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet he do's live:</L>
<L>But oh! that some free Tongue, that lov'd you less,</L>
<L>Cou'd tell how little time that Life must last</L>
<L>To you so precious, and I fear so fatal!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Go on; and if thou kill'st me with the Story,</L>
<L>Believe thou'st crown'd the Kindness of thy Life,</L>
<L>By giving endless Rest to her that wants it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phila.</SPEAKER>
<L>I cannot speak— <STAGE>[Weeping.</STAGE></L>

<L>Then one, that can, I instantly must seek for. <STAGE>[Going out.</STAGE></L>

<L>Publick Enquiry pulls his Ruin on her.</L>
<L>Stay, Madam, stay, and since it must be told,</L>
<L>Know that <HI>Aristor,</HI> soon as free to do it,</L>
<L>Again into your Father's presence rush'd,</L>
<L>And makes a new attempt upon his Person,</L>
<L>But miss'd his Blow, was seiz'd, and in Confine∣ment</L>
<L>Now waits but the assembling of the Council,</L>
<L>Throughly to be examin'd, and discover'd.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Amal.</SPEAKER>
<L>Darkness, and Night surround me.</L>
<L>With this Relief to my sad Bed I go,</L>
<STAGE>[Siezes <HI>Phila</HI>'s Dagger.</STAGE>
<L>There wrapt in horrid Shades will lay me down,</L>
<L>And, when thou com'st charg'd with the heavy News,</L>
<L>Beware, no tedious Circumstance deta in,</L>
<L>No fruitless Pray'r, or word of Comfort 'scape thee;</L>
<L>But with a Voice, such as the Dying use,</L>
<L>Bid me expire—</L>
<L>—Then to my Father go,</L>
<L><PB N="339" REF="346"/>
And say, he kill'd his Daughter in his Foe;</L>
<L>Who knowing, she his Temper cou'd not move,</L>

<L>All Patience this wou'd tire—</L>

<L>My Lord, they will not—</L>

<L>Sometimes he weeps, and throws his Helmet from him,</L>
<L>Kneels to his Troops, and wooes them to Compas∣sion,</L>
<L>Which draws a gen'ral sympathizing Show'r,</L>

<L>'Tis strange, my Mind shou'd sink thus with my Fortunes;</L>
<L>Yet he did talk above their humble strain,</L>

<L>From those fair Lips no sooner fell that word,</L>

<L>Live long and happy, Father of <HI>Mes∣senia!</HI></L>

<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now to fair <HI>Amalintha</HI> wou'd I speak</L>
<L>The joyful Tydings of this Day's Atchievements:</L>
<L>Therefore let her be told, we wish her presence.</L>
<STAGE>[Seeing none move.</STAGE>
<L>Ha! what none stir! perhaps <HI>Aristor</HI>'s with her:</L>
<L>Why let him tell it; from a Lover's mouth,</L>
<L>'Twill bear a Sound more welcome and harmo∣nious.</L>
<L>And sure in Love and Battle none exceeds him,</L>
<L>The last you all can witness; you saw him Fight,</L>
<L>Saw the young Warrior with his Beaver up</L>
<L>Dart like the Bolt of <HI>Jove</HI> amongst their Ranks,</L>
<L>And scatter 'em like an Oak's far-shooting Splinters.</L>
<L>Will none confirm it? this is envious Silence.</L>
<STAGE>[Walks up and down.</STAGE>
<L>Thou <HI>Demagetus,</HI> ha! thou'rt all in Tears,</L>
<L>And so are these that make a Wall about thee:</L>
<L>The Cause deliver, Oh! declare it quickly.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L>Enquire it not, my Lord; too soon 'twill find you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>I must prevent it by my hasty Search.</L>
<L>Reveal it you, or you, since all partake it: <STAGE>[To <HI>Alcander,</HI> &amp;c.</STAGE></L>
<L>What silent still!—</L>
<L>If yet ye do not speak, ye do not love me;</L>
<L>I find ye do not, since ye all are Speechless.</L>
<L><HI>Aristor</HI> wou'd have spoke, had he been here.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Aristor</HI>'s here, but Oh! he cannot speak.</L>
<L><PB N="387" REF="396"/>
You have it now, my Lord, and must weep with us.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy Tongue has warn'd my Eyes to seek the Centre:</L>
<STAGE>[Looks down.</STAGE>
<L>For round this Place I dare not let them stray,</L>
<L>Lest they explain, too soon, thy fatal meaning.</L>
<L>Oh! <HI>Anaxander,</HI> had such Trembling seiz'd me,</L>
<L>When at the Army's Head I met thy Fury;</L>
<L>The poorest of thy Troops had cry'd me Coward.</L>
<L>Why so we're all, there's not a Man that is not;</L>
<L>We all dread something, and can shrink with Terror:</L>
<L>Yet he that comes a Conqu'ror from the Field,</L>
<L>Shall find a vain Applause to crown his Valour,</L>
<L>Tho' fainting thus, and sweating cold with Fear.</L>
<STAGE>[Pauses and leans on an Officer.</STAGE>
<L>But didst thou say, <HI>Aristor</HI> cou'd not speak?</L>
<L>Oh! that I live to ask it! not answer to his Fa∣ther!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! never more!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Sun will keep his Pace, and Time revolve,</L>
<L>Rough Winters pass, and Springs come smiling on;</L>
<L>But Thou dost talk of Never, <HI>Demagetus:</HI></L>
<L>Yet ere Despair prevails, retract that Word</L>
<L>Whose cloudy distance bars the reach of Thought,</L>
<L>Nor lets one Ray of Hope e'er dawn beyond it.</L>
<L>Never, Oh never!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L>This Passion must rise higher, ere it falls.</L>
<L>Divide, and let him know the worst. <STAGE>[To the Officers.</STAGE></L>

<PB N="388" REF="397"/>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>Where is my Son? my Grief has pass'd all Bounds,</L>
<L>All dallying Circumstance, and vain Delusion,</L>
<L>And will be told directly where to find him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! then behold him there!</L>
<STAGE>[They divide. He seeing the Bodies stands awhile amaz'd and speechless, drops his Sword, then speaks.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>So look'd the World to <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> and her Mate;</L>
<L>So gloomy, waste, so destitute of Comfort,</L>
<L>When all Mankind besides lay drown'd in Ruin.</L>
<L>Oh! thou wert well inform'd, my evil Genius;</L>
<L>And the complaining Rocks mourn'd not in vain:</L>
<L>For here my Blood, my dearest Blood I pay</L>
<L>For this poor Wreath, and Fame that withers like it;</L>
<STAGE>[Tears the Wreath, and throws himself upon his Son.</STAGE>
<L>The Ground, that bore it, take the slighted Toy,</L>
<L>Whilst thus I throw me on his breathless Body,</L>
<L>And groan away my Life on these pale Lips.</L>
<L>Oh! O', O', O',—</L>
<L>Thus did I clasp him, ere the Battle join'd,</L>
<L>When Fate, which then had Doom'd him, mock'd my Arms,</L>
<L>Nor in their folds wou'd let me feel my Son.</L>
<L>Oh! that his Voice (tho' low as then it seem'd)</L>
<L>Cou'd reach me now!—But the fond Wish is vain,</L>
<L>And all but this too weak to ease my Pain.</L>
<STAGE>[He takes the Sword that lay at <HI>Aristor</HI>'s Feet, and goes to fall upon it, <HI>Demagetus</HI> takes hold of it.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="389" REF="398"/>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! hold, my Lord; nor stab at once your Army.</L>
<STAGE>[All the Officers and Soldiers kneel, <HI>Alcander</HI> speaks.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alcand.</SPEAKER>
<L>We're all your Sons; and if you strike, my Lord,</L>
<L>The <HI>Spartans</HI> may come back, and take our Bodies;</L>
<L>For when yours goes, our Spirits shall attend it.</L>
<STAGE>[They all prepare to fall on their Swords.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wou'd you then have me live, when thus unbowell'd,</L>
<L>Without the Charms of my <HI>Aristor</HI>'s presence,</L>
<L>Without his Arm to second me in Fight,</L>
<L>And in still Peace his Voice to make it perfect?</L>
<STAGE>[He rises in a Passion and comes forward on the Stage.</STAGE>
<L>Yes, I will live, ye Sov'reign Pow'rs, I will:</L>
<L>You've put my Virtue to its utmost Proof;</L>
<L>Yet thus chastis'd, I own superiour Natures,</L>
<L>And all your fixt Decrees this Sword shall fur∣ther,</L>
<L>'Till <HI>Rhodes</HI> is rescu'd, and my Task completed.</L>
<L>Who knows, but that the Way to your <HI>Elysium</HI></L>
<L>Is Fortitude in Ills, and brave Submission;</L>
<L>Since Heroes whom your Oracles distinguish,</L>
<L>Are often here amidst their Greatness wretched?</L>
<L>But yet my Heart! my lov'd, my lost <HI>Aristor!</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let me succeed him in his active Duty,</L>
<L>And join with all the Earth to bring you Comfort.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>Comfort on Earth! Oh! 'tis not to be found.</L>
<L>My <HI>Demagetus,</HI> thou hast far to travel;</L>
<L><PB N="390" REF="399"/>
The Bloom of Youth sits graceful on thy Brow,</L>
<L>And bids thee look for Days of mighty Pleasures,</L>
<L>For prosp'rous Wars, and the soft Smiles of Beauty,</L>
<L>For generous Sons, that may reflect thy Form,</L>
<L>And give thee Hopes, as I had, of their succour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demag.</SPEAKER>
<L>With these indeed my Thoughts have still been flatter'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aristom.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then let me draw this flatt'ring Veil aside,</L>
<L>And bid thee here, here in this Face behold</L>
<L>How biting Cares have done the work of Age,</L>
<L>And in my best of Strength mark'd me a Dotard.</L>
<L>Defeated Armies, slaughter'd Friends are here;</L>
<L>Disgraceful Bonds, and Cities laid in Ashes:</L>
<L>And if thou find'st, that Life will yet endure it,</L>
<L>Since what I here have lost—</L>
<L>So bow'd, so waining shalt thou see this Carcass,</L>
<L>That scarce thou wilt recall what once it was.</L>
<L>Then be instructed Thou, and All that hear me,</L>
<L>Not to expect the compass of soft Wishes,</L>
<L>Or constant Joys, which fly the fond Possessor.</L>
<L><HI>Since</HI> Man, <HI>by swift returns of Good and Ill,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In all the Course of Life's uncertain still;</HI></L>
<L><HI>By Fortune favour'd now, and now opprest,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And not, 'till Death, secure of Fame, or Rest.</HI></L>
