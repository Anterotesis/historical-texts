<HEAD>The LADY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A WORTHY Squire of sober life,</L>
<L>Had a conceited boasting wise;</L>
<L>Of <HI>him</HI> she daily made complaint,</L>
<L><HI>Herself</HI> she thought a very saint.</L>
<L>She lov'd to load mankind with blame,</L>
<L>And on their errors build her fame.</L>
<L>Her favourite subject of dispute</L>
<L>Was Eve and the forbidden fruit.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
"Had I been Eve," she often cried,</L>
<L>"Man had not fall'n nor woman died;</L>
<L>"I still had kept the orders given,</L>
<L>"Nor for an apple lost my heaven;</L>
<L>"To gratify my curious mind,</L>
<L>"I ne'er had ruin'd all mankind;</L>
<L>"Nor from a vain desire to know,</L>
<L>"Entail'd on all my race such woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Squire reply'd, "I fear 'tis true,</L>
<L>"The same ill spirit lives in you:</L>
<L>"Tempted alike, I dare believe,</L>
<L>"You would have disobey'd like Eve."</L>
<L>The lady storm'd and still deny'd</L>
<L>Both curiosity and pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Squire some future day at dinner,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to try this boastful sinner;</L>
<L>He griev'd such vanity possest her,</L>
<L>And thus in serious terms address'd her.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
"Madam, the usual splendid feast,</L>
<L>"With which our wedding day is grac'd,</L>
<L>"With you I must not share to-day,</L>
<L>"For business summons me away.</L>
<L>"Of all the dainties on the table,</L>
<L>"Pray eat as long as you are able;</L>
<L>"Indulge in every costly dish;</L>
<L>"Enjoy, 'tis what I really wish;</L>
<L>"Only observe one prohibition,</L>
<L>"Nor think it a severe condition;</L>
<L>"On one small dish which cover'd stands,</L>
<L>"You must not dare to lay your hands;</L>
<L>"Go—disobey not on your life,</L>
<L>"Or henceforth you're no more my wife."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The treat was serv'd, the Squire was gone,</L>
<L>The murm'ring lady din'd alone:</L>
<L>She saw whate'er could grace a feast,</L>
<L>Or charm the eye, or please the taste.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
But while she rang'd from this to that,</L>
<L>From ven'son haunch to turtle fat;</L>
<L>On one small dish she chanc'd to light,</L>
<L>By a deep cover hid from sight.</L>
<L>"Oh! here it is—yet not for me!</L>
<L>"I must not taste, nay, dare not see.</L>
<L>"Why place it there? or why forbid</L>
<L>"That I so much as lift the lid?</L>
<L>"Prohibited of this to eat,</L>
<L>"I care not for the sumptuous treat.</L>
<L>"I wonder if 'tis fowl or fish,</L>
<L>"To know what's there I merely wish.</L>
<L>"I'll look—O no, I lose for ever,</L>
<L>"If I'm betray'd my husband's favour.</L>
<L>"I own I think it vastly hard,</L>
<L>"Nay, tyranny, to be debarr'd.</L>
<L>"John you may go—the wine's decanted</L>
<L>"I'll ring or call you when you're wanted."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>Now left alone, she waits no longer,</L>
<L>Temptation presses more and stronger.</L>
<L>"I'll peep—the harm can ne'er be much,</L>
<L>"For tho' I peep I will not touch;</L>
<L>"Why I'm forbid to lift this cover</L>
<L>"One glance will tell, and then 'tis over.</L>
<L>"My husband's absent, so is John,</L>
<L>"My peeping never can be known."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Trembling, she yielded to her wish,</L>
<L>And rais'd the cover from the dish:</L>
<L>She starts—for lo! an open pye</L>
<L>From which six living sparrows fly.</L>
<L>She calls, she screams, with wild surprise,</L>
<L>"Haste John and catch these birds," she cries;</L>
<L>John hears not, but to crown her shame,</L>
<L>In at her call, her husband came.</L>
<L>Sternly he frown'd as thus he spoke,</L>
<L>"Thus is your vow'd allegiance broke!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
"Self-ign'rance led you to believe</L>
<L>"You did not share the sin of Eve.</L>
<L>"Like her's, how blest was your condition!</L>
<L>"How small my gentle prohibition!</L>
<L>"Yet you, tho' fed with every dainty,</L>
<L>"Sat pining in the midst of plenty.</L>
<L>"This dish, thus singled from the rest,</L>
<L>"Of your obedience was the test.</L>
<L>"Your mind, unbroke by self denial,</L>
<L>"Cou'd not sustain this slender trial.</L>
<L>"Humility from hence be taught,</L>
<L>"Learn candour to another's fault;</L>
<L>"Go know, like Eve, from this sad dinner,</L>
<L>"You're both a vain and curious sinner."</L>
