<SPEAKER>Don San.</SPEAKER>
<P>HERE's my hand. Is it a bargain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly—we'll have the wedding to∣night. The young couple are so much in love, they will be glad to dispense with ceremony—it really looks as if Heaven had a hand in this match, for if young Felix had not died so commodioussy at Sala∣manca, we could never have been brothers-in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me your honour! is poor Don Felix dead then? he was a merry young gentleman—I'm sorry for it with all my soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, he is dead as King Philip the Second—but did you know Don Felix?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>As well as any hogshead in my cellar—I kept a tavern three years at Salamanca, and he was my constant customer. I knew his sister too, a brave mettled damsel, that made no more of clapping on a pair of breeches, and stradling a horseback, than if she had never been laced in stays, or encumber'd with a petticoat.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never trouble your head about it. I'll set you out such a repast—the first course shall be as substantial as the bridegroom, and the second as de∣licate as the bride—then for wines and a desert. I don't care if you ask all the Benedictines to sit in judgment upon their flavour and freshness.</P>

<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, there's a servant of a strange gentleman, who has a message for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped</SPEAKER>
<P>What does he want with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will not tell his business to any one but your Worship. He has been fooling with me till I am tired of him.</P>

<P>Can you guess what business a stranger can have with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I suppose the old business—some needy spendthrift who has lost his purse at the gaming-table, and wants to try if I am fool enough to take a liking to him, and lend him as much more upon <HI>no</HI> security.</P>

<P>I have the honour to be gentlemen, with the most profound respect, your honour's most faithful, obsequious and obedient humble servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>This fellow begins his speech like the conclusion of a letter.</P>

<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>What business is it of yours? she's my daughter's maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish your honour much joy of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does the fellow mean? To your business friend—Who are you? What do you want with me? Who do you belong to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, softly, Sir—three questions in a breath are too much for a poor man like me to ans∣wer all at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(To Don San.)</STAGE>
<P>I don't know what to make of this fellow—I believe he's none of the wisest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don San.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should rather suspect he was none of the honestest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you married my pretty lass?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would the fellow be at? What's your business, I say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, to answer your questions—in the first place, I am my master's servant. <STAGE>(To the Maid)</STAGE> And my pretty one, as I was going to tell you, if the Don had not interrupted me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who the devil is your master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a strange gentleman, Sir, who has a strong inclination to pay your Worship a visit. <STAGE>(To the Maid.)</STAGE> And now, as to the little affair between us—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is this strange gentleman? What business has he with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, he is the noble Don Felix de Silva, of Salamanca, who waits below to have the supreme felicity of kissing your honour's hand, and has sent me before to make his compliments to you. <STAGE>(To the Maid)</STAGE> Well, my dear have you thought of the proposal? Do you think me shocking?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mind me fellow—what is this you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you are curious to know particulars about me, I am Lazarillo, of Valencia, as honest a little fellow, tho' I say it, that shou'd not say it, as ever rode before a portmanteau. <STAGE>(To the Maid.)</STAGE> What I pride myself for more than my other good quali∣ties,
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>is that I am the adorer, and faithful slave of your divine and insurmountable beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Turn this way, booby—you are either drunk or mad—Why Don Felix of Salamanca, is dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dead! ay dead and buried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don San.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may get another master, honest friend, for poor Don Felix has no occasion for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is strange news—It must be a very sudden, death—perhaps it was only his ghost that hired me, but I never saw any thing so like a living creature; he gave me a rap over the shoulders just now, that I thought felt very natural. If he is really a ghost, he won't dare to pretend he's alive, and tell a lie before so much good company.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you think of this rascal? Is he a knave or a fool?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don San.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my thinking, he's compounded of both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my poor thinking, he's crazy.</P>
</SP>

</SP>

<P>Truly gentlemen, this is but indifferent treatment for a stranger, to tell a poor servant like me that his master was dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he is, I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I say that he is not only alive, but in good health, sound as a biscuit, and sprightly as a bottle of champagne—and at this moment is ready to come in and give you proof positive by your own eye sight.</P>

<P>Signior Don Pedro, after the many polite letters I have received from you, I could little expect such extraordinary treatment to be kept half an hour cooling my heels among Muleteers and Lacquies.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I humbly ask your pardon. But may I take the liberty to crave your name or title?</P>

<P>Ha, what's this—why this is Donna Clara, the sister of Felix—let's see what will be the end of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm struk dumb with amazement—Sir, I rejoice to see you safe and sound—which indeed is a little extraordinary, considering we had heard you was dead and buried. <STAGE>(<HI>Aside to</HI> Don San.)</STAGE> I wish with all my heart he was under ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was reported I know, that I was dead, but in fact I only received a flesh wound in a quar∣rel —a fainting fit succeeded the loss of blood, and gave occasion to the report of my death—but the moment I recovered strength enough to travel, I mounted my horse, and set out to pay my respects, and keep my engagement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really don't know what to say to it— you have the appearance of a gentleman, but I have had such assurances that Don Felix was dead, that unless I have some strong proofs to the contrary— you'll pardon me, Sir,— I mean no harm— but truly in a matter of this consequence a little caution, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you're perfectly right—but here are proofs—here are no less than four letters—this is from the Governor of the Bank—you know the hand and seal, I suppose.</P>

<P>Sir, will you permit me to congratulate you upon your recovery, and your ar∣rival in Grenada.</P>

<P>Ha! confusion! my old host of Sa∣lamanca—he'll certainly know and will discover me. I think I recollect you, friend.</P>

<P>I believe you may, your honour—my face is no stranger at Salamanca—Joseph Borachio is as well known as the high road to Madrid.</P>

<P>Never fear, Madam—there's something so engaging in your countenance, and so persuasive in your manner, that I would as soon pull down my sign as discover you. <STAGE>(Aside to Clara.)</STAGE> <STAGE>Aloud.</STAGE> I am for want of a better, the master of the Eagle hard-by; and will be bold to say that for good treatment, soft beds, wholesome food and old wine, Joseph Bo∣rachio will not give the wall to any publican in Grenada.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir, if you still doubt—here's my old acquaintance Joseph Borachio, he knows me; I suppose you'll take his word, tho' you seem a little suspicious of mine.</P>

<P>Young gentleman, pray come with me —here has been a small mistake.—Your supposed death—but I'll explain every thing to you within— depend upon it I shall fulfil my engagements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hark'e, Sir—I suppose you are a cava∣lier of honour, and don't imagine that the affections of a young Lady are thrown into the bargain when the old folks are pleased to strike up a contract— you'll ask Donna Leonora's consent, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that. People of fashion never embarrass themselves with such vulgar ideas. Law∣yers do all that's necessary on such occasions—if the conveyances are right, affection and that old stuff, follow of course you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don San.</SPEAKER>
<P>This fellow ought to have been a Sove∣reign Prince by his notions of matrimony, he'll take the wife, let who will chuse the woman; as Kings are obliged to wed for the good of their subjects, this libertine takes a helpmate for the benefit of his creditors. I suppose he'd marry a Mermaid if there was a good Fishing Bank entail'd upon her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have not been so unsuccessful in gal∣lantry, as to apprehend that the Lady will object to me.</P>

<P>Sir, I perceive you have a very favourable opinion of yourself, but it would be more to the purpose if you could persuade the Lady to have the same partiality. But, Sir, a word in your ear. You and I must talk of this matter in another place; you understand me.</P>

<P>Hold a moment—for Heaven's sake no harshness. Leave your daughter to me a little time, and my attention may perhaps bring her to reason. But in the interim, Sir, as I have occasion for some ready cash, and my letters of credit are upon you, I must trouble you for 200 pistoles.</P>

<P>Well, I know not how this will end for other folks, but it has had a very promising beginning for me already—a hundred pistoles for keeping a secret, which I could not get a Maravedi for discovering.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My master desired me to wait for him in the street, but I see no sign of him—'tis twelve by the clock, but by my guts at least four. There is no watch, clock or pendulum in the city, that points to the dining hour with more certainty than the ma∣chinery of my bowels: I feel a craving that must be satisfied. Odzooks! what a delicate flavour of roast, boil'd and bak'd, issues from these purlieus! The very smell is enough to create an appetite. Ay, that way lies the kitchen—I know it by the attraction of the odour. I'll down—but hold, not a sous by For∣tune—my purse is as empty as my belly.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Octavio, <HI>a drunken Porter following with a Portmanteau.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come along, you drunken rascal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Porter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a step further without payment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why scoundrel! would you have your hire before you earn it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Porter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that I would—as I'd like to make sure of my straw before I was to sleep on it—pay me di∣rectly, or here I stick as fast as a mule up to the girths in the mire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Carry in the portmanteau—there's the door, carry in the portmanteau—'tis not three yards, you sot you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Porter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sot in your teeth—pay me.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Throws down the portmanteau.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's this! egad I may get something by it—it has an omen of dinner—I smell beef in it. <STAGE>(<HI>Goes up to the Porter.</HI>)</STAGE> Why you drunken, staggering,
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>sputtering beast of burden, with two legs and no conscience, how dare you prate so saucily to a gen∣tleman! Reel off, or I'll teach you manners.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Re-enter</HI> Lazarillo.</STAGE>
<P>Come hither friend—do you know me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir. I only know that you are a gen∣tleman—that is, I don't know you are a gentleman, but I have a strong suspicion of it. You look for all the world as if you would not let a man who wanted his dinner, and had an excellent stomach, go with∣out it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you acquainted with the tavern?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I am very well acquainted with it. The cellars are full of old wine, the larder full of butcher's meat and poultry—would make a man's mouth water but to look at them. Sir, does your honour smell nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Smell!—No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord bless me, Sir! why there are such steams from savoury pies, such a fumette from plump partridges and roasting-pigs, that I think I can distin∣guish them as easily as I know a rose from a pink, or jonquiel from a colly flower.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will I eat when I'm hungry? Will I sleep when I'm weary? Can your honour doubt it? com∣mand me, Sir, from one extremity of the kingdom to the other—give me but as much as will keep cold air out of my stomach, and I can never tire in your service. Then as for wages, to be sure my last master was a very princely sort of a gentleman—he gave me, Sir—</P>

<SPEAKER>Lazarillo, <HI>alone.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>By your honour's leave, I waited for you till my very bowels began to yearn;—such a craving came upon me, that had pikes, pistols and pettera∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes opposed my passage, I cou'd not avoid entering the house in hopes of—</P>

<P>Then you are a happy man. I had a res∣pect for the roundness of your belly, and the illu∣mination of your nose the first glimpse I had of you, but now my respect is encreased to adoration. If you leave money for masses for your soul, take my advice, get the Fathers instead of praying you out of Purga∣tory into Paradise, to pray you back into your own kitchen.

<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>This evening! why your honour has had no time to refresh yourself. Our roads of late are none of the safest after sunset. Why, Sir, not above a week ago, a calash of mine with a young cavalier and his new married bride, were attacked on the high-road by six of the most desperate banditti that ever cried <HI>stand</HI> to a traveller.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too true, Sir, two of my best mules were shot dead at the first discharge of their carbines; they wounded the gentleman, stunn'd my drivers, and rifled the poor young lady in a terrible manner. In truth, your honour had better not think of venturing 'till morning, when you have the day fairly before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, hang it! such fellows seldom attack single traveller, besides if your horses are good, I think I could out-gallop them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll answer for the horses, better never came out of Andalusia—they have straw up to their wi∣thers, and barley they may bury their ears in—poor dumb beasts, I take as much care of them, and love them as well as if they were my fellow Christians.</P>

<P>Here Sir, here are three of them; but they are not all for your honour. I'll tell you, Sir, how I came by them: As I was going to the post, I met an old fellow servant who happen'd to be in a great hurry upon another errand, and he desired me to ask for his master's letters, and keep them for him; one of them belongs to him, but which I don't know, for to tell you the truth, Sir, my parents found I had such fine natural parts, they would not throw away money in having me taught any thing, so reading was left out among some other little accomplish∣ments in my education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see them. I'll take my own and give you back what belongs to your friend's master. <STAGE>(<HI>Takes

<P>Gentleman, forsooth!</P>

<P>Very well Sir, then let me know your orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master Borachio, learn to respect a man of science. I liv'd two years with a Canon of the Estremadura—the greatest eater in all Portugal; a church-man who did not eat to live, but lived to eat—he thought of nothing else, dreamt of nothing else: I have rode ten miles in a morning to get him a partridge that fed upon green corn, and a black lobster with the pea in it. What do you think he discharged me for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good faith, I know not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>For putting six pullets eggs into a venison pasty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I had robb'd a Church and committed sacriledge, he cou'd not have been more outrageous. He call'd it blasphemy, a crying sin against the first elements of cookery. I see him this moment before me—his huge paunch blown up like a feather bed, his gouty legs resting on two down pillows, his eyes
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>sparkling, his mouth watering, the napkin tucked under his rosy gills, and the whole pie devour'd in imagination before he had tasted a morsel of it: but when it was uncovered, when he saw the eggs—Ass! Blockhead! Villain! (cried he) Eggs in a brown pie! Eggs in a brown pie! out of my sight, and let me never see thee more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there no way to appease him?</P>
</SP>

<P>I knew it was in vain, so did not attempt it—but come Master Borachio, let us have your idea of a dinner.</P>
</SP>

<P>An English plum pudding! That's a dish I am a stranger to. How do you make it?</P>
</SP>

<P>It soulds like a recipe to an apothecary. I'll try it. The English are a good sort of a rich, proud, melancholy, generous, unreasonable sea-faring sort of people; fight too like their own mastiffs, and bear taxes as an Elephant does palanquins and rice bags, but I'm not very fond of their cookery.

<P>It will never do. Mind, I don't find fault with the things, the things are good enough, very good, but half the merit of a service consists in the manner in which you put it on the table. Pig and ham at the same side! Why you might as well put a Hebrew Jew into the same stall at Church with the Grand Inquisitor.

<P>Really, young gentleman, nothing cou'd be more apropos than your arrival. A day's delay longer had lost you your mistress, and a good portion into the bargain. Have you seen any thing of Ferdi∣nand your rival since?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and was upon the point of a most desperate combat, but your daughter stepp'd in and he ran to her for protection: but I frightened him soundly.</P>

<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>

<P>It must be some very great, some extraor∣dinary provocation makes me draw, but when once my sword is out I'm never tired of fighting: 'tis as natural to me as the cloaths on my back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt it, I don't doubt it. I was the same myself when I was young; but what with a little gout and rheumatism in my arms, and better than three score years over my head, my appetite for the duello is somewhat abated, so do you hear, Felix, when your hand's in, if you wou'd frighten Sancho a little for me it wou'd not be amiss. He left me when I saw him last with a menace, and ever since I think I have him before my eyes flourishing a long toledo.</P>
</SP>

<P>Leave him to me, I can manage him as easi∣ly as his son; I wou'd as soon fight two as one of them.</P>
</SP>

<P>Don Sancho besides was bred a soldier. Commerce and money dealing have been my business. To take a man in his own trade is a great disadvan∣tage. I might as soon think of working miracles with St. Jago, or killing a man secundumartem with Doc∣tor Fillgrave, the first physician in Granada.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>To think at my time of life of fighting myself out of the world with cold iron, when fur and flannel, can hardly keep me warm in it, wou'd be a very absurd piece of precipitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then do you consider how difficult it is to bring an old man up to my years. As to your young people they die, and are born every hour; few of them come to maturity, and no great matter—but a hale, healthy, stout old man as I am, is invaluable. Your young puny, tender shrubs are not miss'd from a plantation, but if the old tree falls, think what a length of time it requires to replace him: my eyes run over when I reflect upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder, there's something very melan∣choly in the idea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>That all the care I took of myself shou'd be thrown away—never exposing myself to the night air; never fatiguing myself beyond a gentle perspi∣ration, so careful of my diet, so regular in my hours, so chaste in my amours, and after all this, in the evening of my days to have a long spado run through my guts, and look like a blue-breech'd fly with a corking pin sticking in it!</P>

<P>The same, the very same, except that as you lov'd me when my brother lived, and I had little, I can now reward your disinterested passion with my hand, my heart, and an estate large enough to gratify all our wishes, and to relieve the necessities of all who may want our assistance.</P>

<P>Very true, Madam; I served you both to the best of my power, but as you were to be man and wife, 'tis not strange you know, that I shou'd not always be able to obey one without offending the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>O very well—a sufficient apology! but Don Pedro's in the next room; I'll step and explain what has happened, and send immediately for Leo∣nora and Ferdinand.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I take the liberty of offering my poor congratulations on this joyful occasion? Will you believe it, Sir, I had a sort of an inkling, a divining, that something of this kind would happen; for I dreamt all last night of cats and dogs and a spread eagle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your dreams I hope go by contraries; and you shall be a witness of our harmony, for I intend to keep you in my service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be bold to say, Sir, you never took a wiser resolution. Mercy on me, Sir, you don't know half I can do to serve you. I was Major Domo to the first Grandee of Arragon, he was call'd Don Guzman Poderoso, y Chilos, y Figureroz, y Palidos, y Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dos, y Dumpos: he was a great man, Sir, and had a great many names.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>He lost his only daughter, a most beauti∣ful young Lady, who broke her heart for the death of her lover, and a favourite Squirrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very susceptible Lady, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lazar.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Sir, very surreptible. A certain Duke, a particular friend of my master's, came to condole with him (for poor Grandee, he was quite uncomfortable) and spying me wiping my eyes in an
<PB REF="46"/>outward room, with a Barcelona handkerchief, as he was taking leave of my master, says he, Don Dumpos, I am sorry for your misfortune, but be of good heart, pray be comforted, if you had lost your wife as well as your daughter, I should hardly know how to pity you, while you possess such a treasure in a servant as the incomparable Lazarillo.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>Meaning me, Sir.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a ready invention.</P>

<STAGE>(To Clara)</STAGE>
<P>Madam, your ingenuity has had already such ample revenge for the rude language I used to you, that I hardly know how to offer an apo∣logy for the effects of my mistaken anger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid if any apology were necessary, I ought to make it, for I was certainly the offender; but all unkindness must give way hereafter to esteem and friendship.</P>
