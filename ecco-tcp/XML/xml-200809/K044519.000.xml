<P>A SERMON, PREACHED AT CHART SUTTON, <HI>KENT,</HI> The THIRD of NOVEMBER, 1782, At the opening of the new Church; (<HI>The late Church being destroyed by Lightning.</HI>)</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THIS Discourse, when drawn up, was not inten∣ded for publication; the Author never flattering himself with the most distant idea that any thing he could write was deserving of the public notice. His compliance with the wishes of some worthy friends in the Parish to publish it was, that it might serve as an instrument for conveying the names of those worthy benefactors, who have contributed so liberally and cheafully towards rebuilding the church, and, at the same time, to obviate the objections generally made to briefs, by a view of the net-produce of so large a sum received by this.</P>
<P>Besides expressing, by this public information, the sense of gratitude the Parish is under to such eminent friends, the Author is also inclinable to hope, that the prospect of such uncommon generosity may be an inducement to others, on such occasions, "to go and do likewise," and may afford some encouragement and direction to sufferers labouring under similar calamities.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020020050000030"/>This Discourse, published with these motives, will serve likewise, as a small testimony of the regard the Author entertains for his parishioners; whom he begs to accept of his warmest wishes for their temporal and spiritual welfare, and to admit his situation as an apology for not visiting them oftner, subject as he is to those prior and stronger obligations he feels himself under to the kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean and Chapter of Rochester.</NOTE> friends who conferred on him the living; whose favors it shall ever be his study and pleasure to acknowledge with the sincerest gra∣titude.—</P>
<P>The late church was destroyed by lightning the 23d of April, 1779 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. London Magazine for June, 1779.</NOTE>. The present church was re∣built by contract, on a plan and estimate drawn up by Mr. Henry Holland junior, architect, and is sup∣posed to be the neatest and most commodious church of its size in the diocese.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cxxii, Verse 1.</BIBL>
<Q>—I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the House of the Lord.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is generally agreed that this Psalm, to which these words are an introduction, was composed for the use of the People of Israel at their three public and so∣lemn festivals, namely, of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles; when they were strictly obliged by their law to come from all parts of Judea, and to appear before the Lord at Jerusalem. At which times they were particularly commanded to offer, together with their sacrifices, their united tribute of praise and adoration to God in his temple built and set apart for his more immediate service.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="020020050000050"/>WE can hardly entertain any idea of religion without the appropriation of particular places for the more so∣lemn exercises of it; where societies of men assemble together to present "with one heart and one voice" their joint sacrifice of homage, reverence, and affectionate acknowledgments to one common parent: which na∣turally, at the same time, serve to unite such bodies of men, already allied to one another by the same na∣ture, in the close and intimate ties of religion and be∣nevolence.</P>
<P>AMONG the Jews, as their religion was taught them from Heaven, so we observe, a particular place of worship was built, by God's express command and direction, at Jerusalem; where all their tribes were indispensibly bound to attend at some peculiar seasons and solemnities, such as those I have before mentioned: and other subordinate places were erected in the country nearer and more convenient for their frequent atten∣dance
<PB N="3" REF="020020050000060"/>
at other times. And, in time, to such lengths did the Jews carry their veneration for such religious houses, that the respect, which was at first enjoined to be shewn them by the Supreme Being for the best and wisest purposes, (as we are most sure all his command∣ments are) degenerated at last into the grossest super∣stition. They thought that the attention which they paid to the House of God dispensed with all other obli∣gations however natural and sacred, and that no im∣piety was so great, as the profanation or even the dis∣respectful mention of their Temple at Jerusalem.</P>
<P>THIS was carrying things too far. Yet, that such places should "be had in honour," we may gather from numberless passages in Holy Scripture, and particu∣larly from our Saviour's behaviour to the buyers and sellers in the Temple; where, tho' at all other times he was most eminent for the gentleness and meekness of his deportment, yet on this occasion he is observed
<PB N="4" REF="020020050000070"/>
to have shewn the greatest resentment towards the pro∣faners of that holy place, and to have accompanied his divine exertions with this reproof, "It is written, my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves." <HI>Mark</HI> xi. 16. 17. And so strict a veneration did he himself pay and insisted that others should pay to it, that St. Mark observes, that he would not suffer that "any man should" even "carry any vessel through the Temple."</P>
<P>AND agreeably to this divine pattern, the Apostles and first Disciples of our Lord retained and cherished in their minds great respect and veneration for such religious edifices, and particularly for the Temple at Jerusalem; where they are said, in the Acts of Apostles, "to have continued daily with one accord," <HI>Acts</HI> ii.46. even after our Saviour's ascension and the descent of the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit; and they al∣ways chose to repair, for religious worship, to houses
<PB N="5" REF="020020050000080"/>
already dedicated to God's Service; of which there were great numbers at that time in Judea and in other neighbouring countries: and never omitted, if possible, to assemble insuch places, principally, "where prayers were wont to be made." <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 13. But when "persecution arose on account of the word," and the Jews "thought that they did God service," not only "in putting them out of their synagogues," but also "in killing them," it is no wonder that we find them assembling "apart by themselves for fear of the Jews," and that, as their religious tenets were become in some measure different, they found it necessary, that their places of divine worship should be distinct also.— Notwithstanding this; we observe, that as soon as they found any rest from these persecutions, the primitive Christians, conforming to the example of their Divine Master and his Apostles, did not indiscriminately use every place which presented itself for religious pur∣poses, but that there were particular structures soon set
<PB N="6" REF="020020050000090"/>
apart by them, where they resorted on all solemn occa∣sions, and where they were especially exhorted to "con∣tinue stedfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellow∣ship, in breaking of bread and in prayer." <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 42. And in proportion as these intervals of rest from the malice of their enemies increased, their attention to the erection of such sacred edifices is observed to have in∣creased also. Wherever Christianity was propagated, Churches were built, and the zeal of the early Chris∣tians was not more discernible in the purity of their lives and manners, than in their generous contribu∣tions towards such undertakings.</P>
<P>BUT here we are obliged, with sorrow, to consess, that soon after the secure establishment of Christianity, an undue and superstitious veneration prevailed for such places, and such notions were annexed to them, as neither Scripture warranted, or the genuine usages of primitive Christianity authorized; which Christians
<PB N="7" REF="020020050000100"/>
at last carried so far, that they, like the Jews in the degenerate and declining period of their state, thought that every virtue was comprised in an intemperate zeal for the externals of religion, in ceremonies and in loud professions of honour for the Church; which was at length rendered a refuge for, and the means of absolv∣ing the most enormous criminals.—Herein we can∣not sufficiently admire the wisdom and moderation of the Church of England, which has steered between the two dangerous extremes of superstition on the one hand, and a fond spirit of innovation on the other. Guided by reason, by scripture, and the uncorrupted practices of early Christianity, she has retained and strongly recommends a high regard for houses erected to the honour of God, and has given directions to those whom she has appointed <HI>Overseers over the Church of God,</HI> to set apart by prayer and decent ceremonies, these venerable Temples: And in compliance with the advice of St. Paul, "that all things should be done de∣cently
<PB N="8" REF="020020050000110"/>
and in order" 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. 40. among her mem∣bers, she hath taken great care to provide such conve∣niences for <HI>the assembling together of the People of God,</HI> and such helps and assistances to religion and medita∣tion for them when assembled, as well by the accom∣modation of decent religious houses, of ceremonies and a composed form of prayer, as have procured her ser∣vice and polity from her warmest advocates the title of, "The Beauty of Holiness," and from all sober and well-informed Christians both at home and abroad, the just tribute of honour and respect.</P>
<P>THUS have I mentioned such observations as natu∣rally occurred to me at this time, and are, I hope, ap∣plicable to the present occasion. But still I must desire you to understand, that these accommodations, how∣ever pleasing and venerable in themselves, are only in∣struments, conducive indeed to the purposes of religion, but which will still prove ineffectual without sincere
<PB N="9" REF="020020050000120"/>
sentiments of religion and virtue in the heart, in order to make the offering here presented, pleasing to God and profitable to ourselves; to have it in our power to address each his neighbour in the words of the text, with chearfulness and delight, "let us go to the house of the Lord;" there must be a warm, active principle of devotion in our souls; "the sacrifice that is holy and acceptable to the Lord is our reasonable service," the service of the mind; for the "God," whom we worship, "is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship him." <HI>John</HI> iv. 24.</P>
<P>INDEED in such situations we have every inducement to excite such dispositions in us. We are here assem∣bled in the more immediate presence of Almighty God, who has graciously promised, that "where two or three are gathered together in his name, he will be in the midst of them." <HI>Mathew</HI> xviii. 20. We have here a
<PB N="10" REF="020020050000130"/>
minister properly prepared and commissioned to inform our understandings and to assist our meditations. We have here a number of our fellow christians met toge∣ther for the same religious purposes; we see around us our neighbours, friends, relations and families; such as are allied to us by the tender ties of nature, friend∣ship and kindred, supplicating the Supreme Author of their existence, in the humblest posture of adoration, for mercies spiritual and temporal; acknowledging the unspeakable obligations they are under to him for their creation, preservation and numberless instances of his loving kindness to them; and particularly for that amazing demonstration of his compassion to mankind in the redemption of the world by his son Jesus Christ. Whereby truths of the utmost importance for us to know are communicated to us; every good christian has his reasonable doubts cleared up; the terms of his salvation ascertained; and, at length, what the wisest of the heathen world sought before in vain and of which
<PB N="11" REF="020020050000140"/>
the Jews had but imperfect notions, "life and immor∣tality are brought to" clear "light" by the gospel.— I say, these and such like sentiments must naturally arise in minds before-hand prepared for such holy ex∣ercises; but, at the same time, we may be well assured that they are dispositions which cannot be expected from minds corrupted and enslaved by vice, and stran∣gers to the love of virtue and religion. To such God in his word saith, "what hast thou to do to declare my statutes; or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth? Who hath required this at thine hand to tread my courts, seeing thou hatest instruction and hast cast my words behind thee?" <HI>Psalm</HI> 1. 16. It is the pious and virtuous breast only that can declare, "Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honour dwelleth!" <HI>Psalm</HI> xxvi. 8. and can with truth say, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="020020050000150"/>IT is recorded in the book of Ezra, that certain old men, who had been eye-witnesses of the grandeur of Solomon's Temple, which was destroyed by the Chaldeans, after their return from captivity, when they silently observed how widely inferior their new Temple was to their former one, could not refrain from tears at the camparison. <HI>Ezra</HI> xi. 12. We have no occa∣sion, I believe, to be uneasy by any such reflections; yea, rather, we have abundant reason to be thankful that we are enabled so soon, after our late calamity, joyfully to meet again in our own sanctuary; which, if not superior to our former one, yet has every conveniency and even ornament, which can be required in a house set apart for religious purposes. Without excuse must we also be, if, on the present oc∣casion, we do not feel warm sentiments of gratitude towards those friends, who so generously pitied our distress, relieved our necessities and so "far loved" us, as to have had so large share in "building us a Syna∣gogue."
<PB N="13" REF="020020050000160"/>
But still most inexcusable shall we be, if we do not improve these advantages to the noblest purposes of religion, and make them the means of improvement to ourselves and others: If we do not embrace every opportunity of attending on divine worship in God's House, compel those, who are more immediately under our care, to attend there likewise, and to exhibit a deportment suitable to the solemnity of the place. And not only while there, but we must in all places, and in the general course of our lives, shew an example of sobriety, decency, moderation, industry, justice, hu∣manity and piety; which will be the most effectual way to enforce our admonitions and to make those around us most strongly attached to virtue.</P>
<P>In order to lay a sure foundation for such a beha∣viour in the rising generation; (the want of which is, every where, most sorely lamented,) you must, in a particular manner, be careful to habituate your children
<PB N="14" REF="020020050000170"/>
betimes to virtuous and religious ways; "to reverence God's sanctuary, and to train them up in the way that they should go, that when they are old they may not depart from it:" which will be the most effectual means of making them a comfort to yourselves and worthy members of society; and, beyond all doubt, will be a more certain method of success and happiness to them, than if you had it in your power to bestow on them fortunes, supposing you have left them destitute of those other most essential qualifications. The day which God intended should be more particularly devo∣ted to such purposes, is the sabbath day, emphatically called, by the Apostle, the Lord's day. Some part of which, at least, ought not only to be employed in a regular attendance on public worship, but also in the instruction of your families at home, according to your respective abilities and opportunities. This is a duty, one would imagine, that required no great persuasion to put in practice. Our children are, in a manner, ourselves.
<PB N="15" REF="020020050000180"/>
The attainment also of knowledge is most pleasing to the mind. To impart, therefore, <NOTE PLACE="foot">It must give great pleasure to every humane christian, to find a charity-school set on foot in the parish of CHART, for the instruction of poor children in reading, which is the key of all knowledge, and the practice of such manual arts as may be subservient to their future support in life. This has hitherto been maintained by the application of a small portion of the poor's cess and by private contributions; but particularly by the generous patro∣nage and support of a lady [Mrs. B—e] whose hand and heart are ever open and ready to every good work.</NOTE> religious know∣ledge to those who are so peculiarly our own, and the want of which must cause the greatest distress, must needs afford us most sensible satisfaction; and we shall receive still greater pleasure from this labour of love, when we recollect, that by thus employing these sacred seasons of rest from our worldly engagements, we are obeying the express commands of God by his Prophet Isaiah, who has promised, on the performance of these religious offices on his holy day, success to our honest undertakings and prosperity to our country; "if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
<PB N="16" REF="020020050000190"/>
pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own plea∣sure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." Isaiah lviii. 13. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus have I, my brethren, with great plainness of speech, but with the greatest sincerity and affection, endeavoured to impress you with truths of the greatest importance to your present and future welfare; which, if suffered to have the desired effects on your minds, will "make you wise unto salvation;" will render, du∣ring your journey through a trouble some world, the unavoidable strokes of adversity, whenever they befal you, more tolerable, and the smiles of prosperity less dangerous; will be a means of bringing down the
<PB N="17" REF="020020050000200"/>
blessings of divine providence on yourselves and fami∣lies; and will unavoidably, as far as your influence can be supposed to operate, contribute your small share to the welfare of your country.</P>
<P>I shall conclude my discourse with the admirable ex∣hortation of St. Paul to the Philippians. "Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, what∣soever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think" meditate "on" and practise "these things." <HI>Phil.</HI> iv. 8.</P>
