<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A GREAT part of the Poetical Works of Mr. Shen∣stone, particularly his Elegies and Pastorals, are (as he himself expresses it) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The exact transcripts of the situation of his own mind,"</Q> and abound in fre∣quent allusions to his own place, the beautiful scene of his retirement from the world. Exclusively, there∣fore, of our natural curiosity to be acquainted with the history of an author whose Works we peruse with plea∣sure, some short account of Mr. Shenstone's personal character, and situation in life, may not only be agree∣able, but absolutely necessary, to the reader, as it is impossible he should enter into the true spirit of his writings if he is entirely ignorant of those circum∣stances of his life, which sometimes so greatly influen∣ced his reflections.</P>
<P>I could wish, however, that this task had been al∣lotted to some person capable of performing it in that masterly manner which the subject so well deserves. To confess the truth, it was chiefly to prevent his Re∣mains from falling into the hands of any one still less qualified to do him justice, that I have unwillingly ventured to undertake the publication of them myself.</P>
<P>Mr. Shenstone was the eldest son of a plain unedu∣cated gentleman in Shropshire, who farmed his own estate. The father, sensible of his son's extraordinary capacity, resolved to give him a learned education,
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
and sent him a commoner to Pembroke College in Oxford, designing him for the church; but though he had the most awful notions of the wisdom, power, and goodness, of God, he never could be persuaded to enter into orders. In his private opinions he adhered to no particular sect, and hated all religious disputes. But whatever were his own sentiments, he always shewed great tenderness to those who differed from him. Tenderness, indeed, in every sense of the word, was his peculiar characteristic; his friends, his do∣mestics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind. Indeed this virtue in him was often carried to such excess, that it some∣times bordered upon weakness; yet if he was con∣vinced that any of those ranked amongst the number of his friends had treated him ungenerously, he was not easily reconciled. He used a maxim, however, on such occasions, which is worthy of being observed and imitated; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will be a re∣vengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my nature, to be half a friend."</Q> He was in his temper quite unsuspicious, but if suspicion was once awakened in him, it was not laid asleep again without difficulty.</P>
<P>He was no economist; the generosity of his temper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the use of money: he exceeded, therefore, the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he died was consi∣derably incumbered. But when one recollects the perfect
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
paradise he had raised around him, the hospita∣lity with which he lived, his great indulgence to his servants, his charities to the indigent, and all done with an estate not more than three hundred pounds a-year, one should rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than to blame his want of economy. He left, however, more than sufficient to pay all his debts, and by his will appropriated his whole estate for that purpose.</P>
<P>It was perhaps from some considerations on the narrowness of his fortune that he forbore to marry, for he was no enemy to wedlock, had a high opinion of many among the fair sex, was fond of their society, and no stranger to the tenderest impressions. One, which he received in his youth, was with difficulty surmounted. The lady was the subject of that sweet pastoral, in four parts, which has been so universally admired; and which, one would have thought, must have subdued the loftiest heart, and softened the most obdurate.</P>
<P>His person, as to height, was above the middle sta∣ture, but largely and rather inelegantly formed: his face seemed plain till you conversed with him, and then it grew very pleasing. In his dress he was negli∣gent even to a fault, though, when young, at the uni∣versity, he was accounted a beau. He wore his own hair, which was quite gray very early, in a particular manner; not from any affectation of singularity, but from a maxim he had laid down, that without too
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
slavish a regard to fashion, every one should dress in a manner most suitable to his own person and figure. In short, his faults were only little blemishes, thrown in by Nature, as it were on purpose, to prevent him from rising too much above that level of imperfection allotted to humanity.</P>
<P>His character, as a writer, will be distinguished by simplicity with elegance, and genius with correctness. He had a sublimity equal to the highest attempts; yet, from the indolence of his temper, he chose rather to amuse himself in culling flowers at the foot of the mount, than to take the trouble of climbing the more arduous steeps of Parnassus: but whenever he was disposed to rise, his steps, though natural, were noble, and always well supported. In the tenderness of Ele∣giac poetry he hath not been excelled; in the simpli∣city of Pastoral, one may venture to say he had very few equals. Of great sensibility himself, he never failed to engage the hearts of his readers; and amidst the nicest attention to the harmony of his numbers, he always took care to express, with propriety, the sen∣timents of an elegant mind. In all his writings his greatest difficulty was to please himself. I remember a passage in one of his Letters, where, speaking of his Love Songs, he says,—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Some were written on oc∣casions a good deal imaginary, others not so; and the reason there are so many is, that I wanted to write one good song, and could never please my∣self."</Q> It was this diffidence which occasioned him
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
to throw aside many of his pieces before he had be∣stowed upon them his last touches. I have suppressed several on this account; and if, among those which I have selected, there should be discovered some little want of his finishing polish, I hope it will be attri∣buted to this cause, and, of course, be excused: yet I flatter myself there will always appear something well worthy of having been preserved: and though I was afraid of inserting what might injure the character of my friend, yet, as the sketches of a great master are always valuable, I was unwilling the public should lose any thing material of so accomplished a writer. In this dilemma it will easily be conceived that the task I had to perform would become somewhat dif∣ficult; how I have acquitted myself the public must judge. Nothing, however, except what he had al∣ready published, has been admitted without the advice of his most judicious friends; nothing altered with∣out their particular concurrence. It is impossible to please every one; but 'tis hoped that no reader will be so unreasonable as to imagine that the Author wrote solely for his amusement: his talents were various; and though it may perhaps be allowed that his ex∣cellence chiefly appeared in subjects of tenderness and simplicity, yet he frequently condescended to trifle with those of humour and drollery: these, indeed he himself in some measure degraded, by the title which he gave them of Levities; but had they been en∣tirely rejected, the public would have been deprived
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
of some <HI>jeux d'esprits,</HI> excellent in their kind, and Mr. Shenstone's character as a writer would have been but imperfectly exhibited.</P>
<P>But the talents of Mr. Shenstone were not confined merely to poetry; his character, as a man of clear judgment and deep penetration, will best appear from his Prose Works; it is there we must search for the acuteness of his understanding, and his profound knowledge of the human heart. It is to be lamented, indeed, that some things here are unfinished, and can be regarded only as fragments: many are left as single thoughts, but which, like the sparks of diamonds, shew the richness of the mine to which they belong; or, like the foot of a Hercules, discover the uncom∣mon strength and extraordinary dimensions of that hero. I have no apprehension of incurring blame from any one for preserving these valuable Remains; they will discover to every reader the Author's sentiments on several important subjects; and there can be very few to whom they will not impart many thoughts which they would never perhaps have been able to draw from the source of their own reflections.</P>
<P>But I believe little need be said to recommend the writings of this gentleman to public attention. His character is already sufficiently established; and if he be not injured by the inability of his editor, there is no doubt but he will ever maintain an eminent sta∣tion among the best of our English writers.</P>

<HEAD>A PREFATORY ESSAY ON ELEGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is observable that discourses prefixed to poetry are contrived very frequently to inculcate such tenets as may exhibit the performance to the greatest advan∣tage: the fabric is very commonly raised in the first place, and the measures by which we are to judge of its merit are afterwards adjusted.</P>
<P>There have been few rules given us by the critics concerning the structure of Elegiac poetry; and far be it from the author of the following trifles to dignify his own opinions with that denomination: he would only intimate the great variety of subjects, and the different styles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This essay was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> in which the writers of Elegy have hitherto indulged themselves, and endeavour to shield the following ones by the latitude of their example.</P>
<P>If we consider the etymology of the word<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ε-λεγειν, ε-particulam dolendi.</NOTE>, the epithet which Horace gives it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q>Miserabiles elegos.
<BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, or the confession which Ovid makes concerning it<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><Q>Heu nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen erit.
<BIBL>Ovid. <HI>de Morte Tibulli.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>, I think we may conclude thus much however, that Elegy, in its true and genuine acceptation, includes a tender and que∣rulous idea; that it looks upon this as its peculiar characteristic, and so long as this is thoroughly su∣stained, admits of a variety of subjects, which by its
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
manner of treating them it renders its own: it throws its melancholystole over pretty differentobjects, which, like the dresses at a funeral procession, gives them all a kind of solemn and uniform appearance.</P>
<P>It is probable that Elegies were written, at first, upon the death of intimate friends and near relations; celebrated beauties, or favourite mistresses: beneficent governors and illustrious men: one may add, per∣haps, of all those who are placed by Virgil in the lau∣rel grove of his Elysium, (<HI>Vide</HI> Hurd's Dissertation on Horace's Epistle)
<Q>Quique sui memores alios secere merendo.</Q>
After these subjects were sufficiently exhausted, and the severity of fate displayed in the most affecting instances, the poets sought occasion to vary their com∣plaints, and the next tender species of sorrow that presented itself was the grief of absent or neglected lovers; and this indulgence might be indeed allowed them, but with this they were not contented: they had obtained a small corner in the province of love, and they took advantage from thence, to overrun the whole territory: they sung its spoils, triumphs, ovations, and rejoicings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Dicite Io Paean, et Io bis dicite Paean.
<BIBL>Ovid.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, as well as the captivity and exequies that attended it: they gave the name of Elegy to their pleasantries as well as lamentations, till at last, through their abundant fondness for the myrtle, they forgot that the cypress was their peculiar garland.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
In this it is probable they deviated from the origi∣nal design of Elegy, and it should seem that any kind of subjects, treated in such a manner as to diffuse a pleasing melancholy, might far better deserve the name than the facetious mirth and libertine festivity of the successful votaries of Love.</P>
<P>But, not to dwell too long upon an opinion which may seem, perhaps, introduced to favour the follow∣ing performance, it may not be improper to examine into the use and end of Elegy. The most important end of all poetry is to encourage virtue. Epic and tragedy chiefly recommend the public virtues; Elegy is of a species which illustrates and endears the private. There is a truly virtuous pleasure connected with many pensive contemplations, which it is the province and excellency of Elegy to enforce: this, by presenting suitable ideas, has discovered sweets in melancholy which we could not find in mirth, and has led us, with success, to the dusty urn, when we could draw no pleasure from the sparkling bowl. As Pastoral con∣veys an idea of simplicity and innocence, it is in par∣ticular the task and merit of Elegy to shew the inno∣cence and simplicity of rural life to advantage; and that in a way distinct from Pastoral, as much as the plain but judicious landlord may be imagined to sur∣pass his tenant both in dignity and understanding. It should also tend to elevate the more tranquil virtues of humility, disinterestedness, simplicity, and innocence:
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
but then there is a degree of elegance and re∣finement no way inconsistent with these rural virtues, and that raises Elegy above that <HI>merum rus,</HI> that un∣polished rusticity, which has given our Pastoral writers their highest reputation.</P>
<P>Wealth and splendor will never want their proper weight; the danger is lest they should too much pre∣ponderate: a kind of poetry, therefore, which throws its chief influence into the otherscale, that magnifies the sweets of liberty and independence, that endears the honest delights of love and friendship, that celebrates the glory of a good name after death, that ridicules the futile arrogance of birth, that recommends the innocent amusement of letters, and insensibly prepares the mind for that humanity it inculcates; such a kind of poetry may chance to please, and if it please, should seem to be of service.</P>
<P>As to the style of Elegy, it may be well enough determined from what has gone before: it should imi∣tate the voice and language of grief, or, if a metaphor of dress be more agreeable, it should be simple and dif∣fuse, and flowing as a mourner's veil. A versification, therefore, is desirable, which, by indulging a free and unconstrained expression, may admit of that simplicity which Elegy requires.</P>
<P>Heroic metre, with alternate rhyme, seems well e∣nough adapted to this species of poetry; and, however exceptionable upon other occasions, its inconveniencies
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
appear to lose their weight in shorter Elegies, and its advantages seem to acquire an additional importance. The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a collection of Elegies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N.B.</HI> This preface was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> not long since published, the product of a gentleman of the most exact taste, and whose untimely death merits all the tears that Elegy can shed.</P>
<P>It is not impossible that some may think this metre too lax and prosaic; others, that even a more disso∣lute variety of numbers may have superior advan∣tages: and in favour of these last might be produced the example of Milton in his Lycidas, together with one or two recent and beautiful imitations of his versi∣fication in that monody. But this kind of argument, I am apt to think, must prove too much, since the writers I have in view seem capable enough of recom∣mending any metre they shall chuse; though it must be owned also, that the choice they make of any is at the same time the strongest presumption in its favour.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be no great difficulty to compro∣mise the dispute. There is no one kind of metre that is distinguished by rhymes but is liable to some objec∣tion or other. Heroic verse, where every second line is terminated by a rhyme, (with which the judgment requires that the sense should in some measure also terminate) is apt to render the expression either scanty or constrained; and this is sometimes obser∣vable
<PB N="xvi" REF="16"/>
in the writings of a poet lately deceased, though I believe no one ever threw so much sense together, with so much ease, into a couplet, as Mr Pope: but as an air of constraint too often accompanies this metre, it seems by no means proper for a writer of Elegy.</P>
<P>The previous rhyme in Milton's Lycidas is very frequently placed at such a distance from the follow∣ing, that it is often dropt by the memory (much better employed in attending to the sentiment) be∣fore it be brought to join its partner; and this seems to be the greatest objection to that kind of versifica∣tion: but then the peculiar ease and variety it admits of are, no doubt, sufficient to overbalance the objec∣tion, and to give it the preference to any other, in an Elegy of length.</P>
<P>The chief exception, to which stanza of all kinds is liable, is, that it breaks the sense too regularly when it is continued through a long poem; and this may be, perhaps, the fault of Mr. Waller's excellent panegyric. But if this fault be less discernible in smaller compositions, as I suppose it is, I flatter my∣self that the advantages I have before mentioned, re∣sulting from alternate rhyme, (with which stanza is, I think, connected) may at least, in shorter Elegies, be allowed to outweigh its imperfections.</P>
<P>I shall say but little of the different kinds of Elegy. The melancholy of a lover is different, no doubt, from what we feel on other mixed occasions. The mind in
<PB N="xvii" REF="17"/>
which love and grief at once predominate is softened to an excess. Love-elegy, therefore, is more negli∣gent of order and design, and, being addressed chiefly to the ladies, requires little more than tenderness and perspicuity. Elegies that are formed upon promiscu∣ous incidents, and addressed to the world in general, inculcate some sort of moral, and admit a different degree of reasoning, thought, and order.</P>
<P>The Author of the following Elegies entered on his subjects occasionally, as particular incidents in life suggested, or dispositions of mind recommended them to his choice. If he describes a rural landscape, or unfolds the train of sentiments it inspired, he fairly drew his picture from the spot, and felt very sen∣sibly the affection he communicates: if he speaks of his humble shed, his flocks and his fleeces, he does not counterfeit the scene, who having (whether thro' choice or necessity is not material) retired betimes to country solitudes, and sought his happiness in rural employments, has a right to consider himself as a real shepherd. The flocks, the meadows, and the grottos, are his own, and the embellishment of his farm his sole amusement. As the sentiments, therefore, were inspired by Nature, and that in the earlier part of his life, he hopes they will retain a natural appearance, diffusing at least some part of that amusement which, he freely acknowledges, he received from the compo∣sition of them.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="18"/>
There will appear, perhaps, a real inconsistency in the moral tenour of the several Elegies, and the sub∣sequent ones may sometimes seem a recantation of the preceding. The reader will scarcely impute this to oversight, but will allow that men's opinions, as well as tempers, vary; that neither public nor pri∣vate, active nor speculative, life, are unexceptionably happy, and, consequently, that any change of opinion concerning them may afford an additional beauty to poetry, as it gives us a more striking representation of life.</P>
<P>If the Author has hazarded, throughout, the use of English or modern allusions, he hopes it will not be imputed to an entire ignorance, or to the least dis∣esteem of the ancient learning. He has kept the an∣cient plan and method in his eye, though he builds his edifice with the materials of his own nation. In other words, through a fondness for his native coun∣try, he has made use of the flowers it produced, tho', in order to exhibit them to the greater advantage, he has endeavoured to weave his garland by the best mo∣del he could find; with what success, beyond his own amusement, must be left to judges less partial to him than either his acquaintance or his friends.—If any of those should be so candid as to approve the varie∣ty of subjects he has chosen, and the tenderness of sentiment he has endeavoured to impress, he begs the metre also may not be too suddenly condemned. The
<PB N="xix" REF="19"/>
public ear, habituated of late to a quicker measure, may perhaps consider this as heavy and languid; but an objection of that kind may gradually lose its force, if this measure should be allowed to suit the nature of Elegy.</P>
<P>If it should happen to be considered as an objection, with others, that there is too much of a moral cast dissused through the whole, it is replied, that he en∣deavoured to animate the poetry so far as not to ren∣der this objection too obvious, or to risk excluding the fashionable reader; at the same time never devia∣ting from a fixed principle, that poetry without mora∣lity is but the blossom of a fruit-tree. Poetry is, in∣deed, like that species of plants which may bear at once both fruits and blossoms, and the tree is by no means in perfection without the former, however it may be embellished by the flowers which surround it.</P>

The seat of the late William Shenstone, Esq.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY R. DODSLEY.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Leasowes is situate in the parish of Hales Owen, a small market-town in the county of Salop, but sur∣rounded by other counties, and thirty miles from Shrewsbury, as it is near ten to the borders of Shrop∣shire. Though a paternal estate, it was never distin∣guished for any peculiar beauties till the time of its late owner. It was reserved for a person of his in∣genuity both to discover and improve them, which he has done so effectually, that it is now considered as amongst the principal of those delightful scenes which persons of taste, in the present age, are desi∣rous to see. Far from violating its natural beauties, Mr. Shenstone's only study was to give them their full effect; and although the form in which things now
<PB N="xxii" REF="22"/>
appear be indeed the consequence of much thought and labour, yet the hand of Art is no way visible ei∣ther in the shape of ground, the disposition of trees, or (which are here so numerous and striking) the ro∣mantic fall of his cascades.</P>
<P>But I will now proceed to a more particular de∣scription. About half a mile short of Hales Owen, in your way from Birmingham to Bewdley, you quit the great road, and turn into a green lane on the left hand, where, descending in a winding manner to the bottom of a deep valley finely shaded, the first ob∣ject that occurs is a kind of ruinated wall, and a small gate, within an arch, inscribed, <Q REND="inline">"The Priory Gate."</Q> Here, it seems, the company should proper∣ly begin their walk, but generally chuse to go up with their horses or equipage to the house, from whence returning, they descend back into the val∣ley. Passing through a small gate at the bottom of the fine swelling lawn that surrounds the house, you enter upon a winding path, with a piece of water on your right. The path and water, overshadowed with trees that grow upon the slopes of this narrow dingle, render the scene at once cool, gloomy, solemn, and sequestered, and form so striking a contrast to the lively scene you have just left, that you seem all on a sudden landed in a subterraneous kind of region. Winding forward down the valley, you pass beside a small root-house, where, on a tablet, are these lines:<Q><PB N="xxiil" REF="23"/><LG>
<L>" Here in cool grot and mossy cell,</L>
<L>" We rural Fays and Faeries dwell;</L>
<L>" Tho' rarely seen by mortal eye,</L>

<L>" We frisk it near these crystal streams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Her beams, reflected from the wave,</L>
<L>" Afford the light our revels crave;</L>
<L>" The turf, with daisies broider'd o'er,</L>
<L>" Exceeds, we wot, the Parian floor;</L>
<L>" Nor yet for artful strains we call,</L>
<L>" But listen to the water's fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Would you then taste our tranquil scene,</L>

<L>" Who dares our hallow'd haunts profane!"</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>These sentiments correspond as well as possible with the ideas we form of the abode of Fairies, and, appearing deep in this romantic valley, serve to keep alive such enthusiastic images while this sort of scene continues.</P>
<P>You now pass through The Priory Gate before mentioned, and are admitted into a part of the val∣ley somewhat different from the former, tall trees, high irregular ground, and rugged scars. The right presents you with, perhaps, the most natural, if not the most striking, of the many cascades here found;
<PB N="xxiv" REF="24"/>
the left with a sloping grove of oaks; and the centre with a pretty circular landscape appearing through the trees, of which Hales Owen steeple, and other objects at a distance, form an interesting part. The seat beneath the ruinated wall has these lines of Vir∣gil inscribed, suiting well with the general tenour of Mr. Shenstone's late situation:<Q><L>— " Lucis habitamus opacis,</L>
<L>" Riparumque toros et prata recentia rivis</L>
<L>" Incolimus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>—We dwell in shady groves,</L>
<L>And seek the groves with cooling streams refresh'd,</L>
<L>And trace the verdant banks.</L></Q></P></NOTE>"</L></Q></P>
<P>You now proceed a few paces down the valley to another bench, where you have this cascade in front, which, together with the internal arch and other appendages, make a pretty irregular picture. I must observe, once for all, that a number of these protem∣pore benches (two stumps with a transverse board) seem chiefly intended as hints to spectators, lest in passing cursorily through the farm they might suffer any of that immense variety the place furnishes to escape their notice. The stream attending us, with its agreeable murmurs, as we descend along this pleasing valley, we come next to a small seat, where we have a sloping grove upon the right, and on the left a striking vista to the steeple of Hales Owen,
<PB N="xxv" REF="25"/>
which is here seen in a new light. We now descend farther down this shady and sequestered valley, ac∣companied on the right by the same brawling rivulet running over pebbles, till it empties itself into a fine piece of water at the bottom. The path here wind∣ing to the left conforms to the water before men∣tioned, running round the foot of a small hill, and accompanying this semicircular lake into another winding valley, somewhat more open, and not less pleasing, than the former: however, before we enter this, it will be proper to mention a seat about the centre of this water-scene, where the ends of it are lost in the two vallies on each side, and in front it is invisibly connected with another piece of water, of about twenty acres, open to Mr. Shenstone, but not his property. This last was a performance of the monks, and part of a prodigious chain of fish-ponds that belonged to Hales Abbey. The back ground of this scene is very beautiful, and exhibits a picture of villages and varied ground finely held up to the eye.</P>
<P>I speak of all this as already finished, but through some misfortune in the mound that pounds up the water it is not completed.</P>
<P>We now leave The Priory upon the left, which is not meant for an object here, and wind along into the other valley: and here I cannot but take notice of the judgment which formed this piece of water; for although it be not very large, yet, as it is formed
<PB N="xxvi" REF="26"/>
by the concurrence of three vallies, in which two of the ends are hid, and in the third it seems to join with the large extent of water below, it is, to all ap∣pearance, unbounded. I must confess I never saw a more natural bed for water, or any kind of lake that pleased me better; but it may be right to mention, that this water, in its full extent, has a yet more im∣portant effect from Mr. Shenstone's house, where it is seen to a great advantage. We now, by a pleasing serpentine walk, enter a narrow glade in the valley, the slopes on each side finely covered with oaks and beeches, on the left of which is a common bench, which affords a retiring place secluded from every eye, and a short respite, during which the eye reposes on a fine amphitheatre of wood and thicket.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a seat beneath a prodigiously fine canopy of spreading oak, on the back of which is this inscription:
<Q><L>" Huc ades, O Meliboee! caper tibi salvus et hoedi;</L>
<L>" Et si quid cessare potes, requiesce sub umbra<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>Hither, O Meliboeus! bend thy way;</L>
<L>Thy herds, thy goats, secure from harm, repose;</L>
<L>If happy leisure serve a while to stay,</L>
<L>Here rest thy limbs beneath these shady boughs.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q>
The picture before it is that of a beautiful home∣scene; a small lawn of well-varied ground, encom∣passed with hills and well-grown oaks, and embel∣lished with a cast of the piping Faunus, amid trees
<PB N="xxvii" REF="27"/>
and shrubs on a slope upon the left, and on the right, and nearer the eye, with an urn thus inscribed:
<Q>" Ingenio et amicitiae <LB/>" Gvlielmi Somerville."</Q>
And on the opposite side,
<Q>" G. S. posvit, <LB/>" Debita spargens lacrima favillam <LB/>" Vatis amici<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>TRANSLATION. <Q>To the genius and friendship <LB/>of <LB/>WILLIAM SOMERVILLE, <LB/>By W. S. <L>Sprinkling the ashes of a friendly bard</L><L>With tributary tears.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</Q> The scene is inclosed on all sides by trees; in the middle only there is an opening, where the lawn is continued, and winds out of sight.</P>
<P>Here entering a gate, you are led through a thic∣ket of many sorts of willows, into a large root-house, inscribed to the Right Honourable the Earl of Stam∣ford. It seems that worthy peer was present at the first opening of the cascade, which is the principal object from the root-house, where the eye is present∣ed with a fairy vision, consisting of an irregular and romantic fall of water, very unusual, one hundred and fifty yards in continuity; and a very striking scene it affords. Other cascades may possibly have the advantage of a greater descent and a larger tor∣rent; but a more wild and romantic appearance of water, and at the same time strictly natural, is what
<PB N="xxviii" REF="28"/>
I never saw in any place whatever. This scene, tho' comparatively small, is yet aggrandized with so much art, that we forget the quantity of water which flows through this close and overshaded valley, and are so much transported with the intricacy of scene, and the concealed height from whence it flows, that we, without reflection, add the idea of magnificence to that of beauty. In short, it is not but upon reflec∣tion that we find the stream is not a Niagara, but rather a water-fall in miniature; and that the same artifice, upon a larger scale, were there large trees instead of small ones, and a river instead of a rill, would be capable of forming a scene that would ex∣ceed the utmost of our ideas. But I will not dwell longer upon this inimitable scene; those who would admire it properly must view it, as surely as those that view it must admire it beyond almost any thing they ever saw.</P>
<P>Proceeding on the right-hand path, the next seat affords a scene of what Mr. Shenstone used to call his Forest ground, consisting of wild green slopes peeping through dingle, or irregular groupes of trees, a con∣fused mixture of savage and cultivated ground, held up to the eye, and forming a landscape fit for the pencil of Salvator Rosa.</P>
<P>Winding on beside this lawn, which is over-arch∣ed with spreading trees, the eye catches, at intervals, over an intermediate hill, the spire of Hales church,
<PB N="xxix" REF="29"/>
forming here a perfect obelisk—the urn to Mr. So∣merville, &amp;c.; and now passing through a kind of thicket, we arrive at a natural bower of almost cir∣cular oaks, inscribed in the manner following:<Q><L>" To Mr. DODSLEY.</L>
<L>" Come then, my Friend! thy sylvan taste display;</L>
<L>" Come hear thy Faunus tune his rustic lay:</L>
<L>" Ah! rather come, and in these dells disown</L>
<L>" The care of other strains, and tune thine own."</L></Q></P>
<P>On the bank above it, amid the fore-mentioned shrubs, is a statue of the piping Faun, which not on∣ly embellishes this scene, but is also seen from the court before the house, and from other places: it is surrounded by venerable oaks, and very happily si∣tuated. From this bower also you look down upon the fore-mentioned irregular ground, shut up with trees on all sides, except some few openings to the more pleasing parts of this grotesque and hilly coun∣try. The next little bench affords the first, but not most striking, view of The Priory. It is indeed a small building, but seen as it is beneath trees, and its extre∣mity also hid by the same, it has in some sort the dig∣nity and solemn appearance of a larger edifice.</P>
<P>Passing through a gate, we enter a small open grove, where the first seat we find affords a picturesque view, through trees, of a clump of oaks at a distance, over∣shadowing a little cottage upon a green hill: we thence immediately enter a perfect dome or circular temple of magnificent beeches, in the centre of which it was
<PB N="xxx" REF="30"/>
intended to place an antique altar, or a statue of Pan. The path serpentizing through this open grove, leads us by an easy ascent to a small bench with this motto,<Q><L>— " Me gelidum nemus</L>
<L>" Nympharumque leves cum satyris chori</L>
<L>" Secernant populo<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION.<Q>

<L>—May the cool grove,</L>
<L>And gay assembled nymphs with sylvans mix'd,</L>
<L>Conceal me from the world!</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L><BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q> which alludes to the retired situation of the grove. There is also seen, through an opening to the left, a pleasing landscape of a distant hill, with a whited farm-house upon the summit; and to the right hand a beautiful round slope, crowned with a clump of large firs, with a pyramidal seat on its centre, to which, after no long walk, the path conduct us.</P>
<P>But we first come to another view of The Priory, more advantageous, and at a better distance, to which the eye is led down a green slope, through a scenery of tall oaks, in a most agreeable manner, the grove we have just passed on one side, and a hill of trees and thicket on the other, conducting the eye to a narrow opening through which it appears.</P>
<P>We now ascend to a small bench, where the cir∣cumjacent country begins to open; in particular a glass-house appears between two large clumps of trees, at about the distance of four miles; the glass-houses in this country not ill resembling a distant pyramid.
<PB N="xxxi" REF="31"/>
Ascending to the next seat, which is in the Gothic form, the scene grows more and more extended; woods and lawns, hills and vallies, thicket and plain, agreeably intermingled. On the back of this seat is the following inscription, which the Author told me that he chose to fix here, to supply what he thought some want of life in this part of the farm, and to keep up the spectator's attention till he came to scale the hill beyond.</P>
<P>INSCRIPTION.<Q><LG>
<L>' Shepherd, wouldst thou here obtain</L>

<L>' Joy that suits the rural sphere?</L>

<LG>
<PB N="xxxii" REF="32"/>
<L>" Think not she, whose empty pride</L>

<L>" Seek no more—the rest is vain;</L>
<L>" Pleasure ending soon in pain;</L>
<L>" Anguish lightly gilded o'er:</L>
<L>" Close thy wish, and seek no more."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>And now, passing through a wicket, the path winds up the back part of a circular green hill, discovering little of the country till you enter a clump of stately firs upon the summit. Over-arched by these firs is an octagonal seat, the back of which is so contrived as to form a table or pedestal for a bowl or goblet, thus inscribed—
<Q>" To all friends round The Wrekin!"</Q>
This facetious inscription, being an old Shropshire health, is a commemoration of his country friends,
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="33"/>
from which this part of Shropshire is divided: add to this that The Wrekin, that large and venerable hill, appears full in front, at the distance of about thirty miles.</P>
<P>The scene is a very fine one, divided by the firs in∣to several compartments, each answering to the octa∣gonal seat in the centre; to each of which is allotted a competent number of striking objects to make a complete picture. A long serpentine stream washes the foot of this hill, and is lost behind trees at one end, and a bridge thrown over at the other. Over this the eye is carried from very romantic home∣scenes to very beautiful ones at a distance. It is im∣possible to give an idea of that immense variety, that fine configuration of parts, which engage our atten∣tion from this place. In one of the compartments you have a simple scene of a cottage, and a road winding behind a farm-house half covered with trees, upon the top of some wild sloping ground; and in an∣other a view of the town, appearing from hence as upon the shelving banks of a large piece of water in the flat. Suffice it to say, that the hill and vale, plain and woodland, villages and single houses, blue distant mountains that skirt the horizon, and green hills ro∣mantically jumbled, that form the intermediate ground, make this spot more than commonly stri∣king—nor is there to be seen an acre of level ground through the large extent to which the eye is carried.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="34"/>
Hence the path winds on betwixt two small benches, each of which exhibits a pleasing landscape, which can∣not escape the eye of a connoisseur.</P>
<P>Here we wind through a small thicket, and soon enter a cavity in the hill, filled with trees, in the centre of which is a seat, from whence is discovered, gleaming across the trees, a considerable length of the serpentine stream before mentioned, running un∣der a slight rustic bridge to the right: hence we ascend in a kind of Gothic alcove, looking down a slope, sided with large oaks and tall beeches, which toge∣ther over-arch the scene. On the back of this build∣ing is found the following</P>
<P>INSCRIPTION.<Q><LG>
<L>" O you that bathe in courtlye blysse,</L>
<L>" Or toyle in Fortune's giddy spheare,</L>
<L>" Do not too rashlye deeme amysse</L>
<L>" Of him that bydes contented here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Nor yet disdeigne the russet stoale</L>
<L>" Which o'er each carelesse lymbe he flyngs;</L>
<L>" Nor yet deryde the beechen bowle</L>
<L>" In whyche he quaffs the lympid springs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Forgive him, if at eve or dawne,</L>
<L>" Devoide of worldlye cark, he stray,</L>
<L>" Or all beside some flowerye lawne</L>
<L>" He waste his inoffensive daye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" So may he pardonne fraud and strife,</L>
<L>" If such in courtlye haunt he see;</L>
<L>" For faults there beene in busye life</L>
<L>" From whyche these peaceful glennes are free."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Below this alcove is a large sloping lawn, finely bounded, crossed by the serpentine water before mentioned,
<PB N="xxxv" REF="35"/>
and interspersed with single, or clumps of oaks at agreeable distances. Further on the scene is finely varied, the hills rising and falling towards the opposite concavities, by the side of a long winding vale, with the most graceful confusion. A∣mong other scenes that form this landscape, a fine hanging wood, backed and contrasted with a wild heath, intersected with cross roads, is a very consi∣derable object. Near adjoining to this is a seat, from whence the water is seen to advantage in many dif∣ferent stages of its progress; or where (as a poetical friend once observed) the proprietor has taken the Naiad by the hand, and led her an irregular dance into the valley.</P>
<P>Proceeding hence through a wicket, we enter up∣on another lawn, beyond which is a new theatre of wild shaggy precipices, hanging coppice ground, and smooth round hills between, being not only differ∣ent, but even of an opposite character, to the ground from which we passed. Walking along the head of this lawn, we come to a seat under a spreading beech, with this</P>
<P>INSCRIPTION.<Q><L>" Hoc erat in votis: modus agri non ita magnus,</L>
<L>" Hortus ubi, et tecto vicinus jugis aquae fons,</L>
<L>" Et paulum sylvae super his foret. Auctius atque</L>
<L>" Dii melius fecere."—</L></Q></P>
<P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>This was my wish—an humble spot of ground,</L>
<L>A garden well-dispos'd, and fenc'd around,</L>
<L>A bubbling fountain, to my dwelling nigh,</L>
<L>With crystal treasures stor'd, and never dry,</L>
<L>The whole defended by a modest wood.—</L>
<L>This was my wish—my wish the gods allow'd,</L>
<L>And ev'n beyond that wish indulgently bestow'd.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xxxvi" REF="36"/>
In the centre of the hanging lawn before you is discovered the house, half hid with trees and bushes: a little hanging wood, and a piece of winding wa∣ter, issues through a noble clump of large oaks and spreading beeches. At the distance of about ten or twelve miles Lord Stamford's grounds appear, and beyond these the Clee hills in Shropshire. The scene here consists of admirably-varied ground, and is, I think, a very fine one. Hence passing still along the top of the lawn, we cross another gate, and behind the fence being to descend into the valley. About half way down is a small bench, which throws the eye upon a near scene of hanging woods and shaggy wild declivities, intermixed with smooth green slopes and scenes of cultivation.</P>
<P>We now return again into the great lawn at bot∣tom, and soon come to a seat, which gives a nearer view of the water before mentioned, between the trunks of high overshadowing oaks and beeches, be∣yond which the winding line of trees is continued down the valley to the right. To the left, at a di∣stance, the top of Clent hill appears, and the house upon a swell, amidst trees and bushes. In the centre, the eye is carried by a sideling view down a length of <PB N="xxxvii" REF="37"/>
lawn, till it rests upon the town and spire of Hales, with some picturesque and beautiful ground rising behind it.</P>
<P>Somewhat out of the path, and in the centre of a noble clump of stately beeches, is a seat inscribed to Mr. Spence, in these words:<Q>IOSEPHO SPENCE, <LB/>eximio nostro Critoni; <LB/>cvi dicari vellet <LB/>Mvsarvm omnivm et Gratiarvm chorvs, <LB/>dicat amicitia. <LB/>1758<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>Dedicated by friendship <LB/>to JOSEPH SPENCE, <LB/>our most excellent Crito, <LB/>whom <LB/>the unanimous consent <LB/>of every Muse and Grace <LB/>made choice of <LB/>to be so distinguished.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>We now, through a small gate, enter what is called The Lover's Walk, and proceed immediately to a seat where the water is seen very advantageously at full length; which, though not large, is so agreeably shap∣ed, and has its bounds so well concealed, that the beholder may receive less pleasure from many lakes of greater extent. The margin on one side is fringed with alders, the other is overhung with most stately oaks and beeches, and the middle beyond the wa∣ter presents the Hales Owen scene, with a group of houses on the slope behind, and the horizon well
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="38"/>
fringed with the wood. Now winding a few paces round the margin of the water, we come to another small bench, which presents the former scene some∣what varied, with the addition of a whited village a∣mong trees upon a hill. Proceeding on, we enter the pleasing gloom of this agreeable walk, and come to a bench beneath a spreading beech that overhangs both walk and water, which has been called The Assigna∣tion Seat, and has this inscription on the back of it:<Q><L>" Nerine Galatea! thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae,</L>
<L>" Candidior cygnis, hedera formosior alba!</L>
<L>" Cum primum pasti repetent praesepia tauri,</L>
<L>" Si qua tui Corydonis habet te cura, venito<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>O Galatea! Nereus' lovely child,</L>
<L>Sweeter than Hybla thyme, more undefil'd</L>
<L>Than down of swan, or ivy's purest white,</L>
<L>When the full oxen, warn'd by fading light,</L>
<L>Home to the stall their sober footsteps bend,</L>
<L>If Damon's dear, to Damon's call attend.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q> Here the path begins gradually to ascend beneath a depth of shade, by the side of which is a small bub∣bling rill, either forming little peninsulas, rolling over pebbles, or falling down small cascades, all under cover, and taught to murmur very agreeably. This very soft and pensive scene, very properly styled The Lover's Walk, is terminated with an ornamented urn, inscribed to Miss Dolman, a beautiful and ami∣able relation of Mr. Shenstone's, who died of the small-pox, about twenty-one years of age, in the fol∣lowing words on one side:<Q><PB N="xxxix" REF="39"/>
Peramabili suae consobrinae <LB/>M. D.</Q> On the other side:<Q>Ah! Maria! <LB/>pvellarvm elegantissima! <LB/>ah Flore venvstatis abrepta, <LB/>vale! <LB/>hev qvanto minvs est <LB/>cvm reliqvis versari, <LB/>qvant tvi <LB/>meminisse<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION.
<Q>—Sacred to the memory <LB/>of <LB/>a most amiable kinswoman. <LB/>Ah! Maria! <LB/>most elegant of nymphs! <LB/>snatched from us <LB/>in thy bloom of beauty, <LB/>ah! farewell!</Q></P>
<P><Q>How much inferior <LB/>is the living conversation <LB/>of others <LB/>to the bare remembrance <LB/>of thee!</Q></P></NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P>The ascent from hence winds somewhat more steep∣ly to another seat, where the eye is thrown over a rough scene of broken and furzy ground, upon a piece of water in the flat, whose extremities are hid behind trees and shrubs, amongst which the house appears, and makes upon the whole no unpleasing picture. The path still winds under cover up the hill, the steep declivity of which is somewhat eased by the serpen∣tine sweep of it, till we come to a small bench, with this line from Pope's Eloisa:<Q><PB N="xl" REF="40"/>
<L>" Divine oblivion of low-thoughted Care!"</L></Q> The opening before it presents a solitary scene of trees, thickets, and precipice, and terminates upon a green hill, with a clump of firs on the top of it.</P>
<P>We now find the great use as well as beauty of the serpentine path in climbing up this wood, the first seat of which, alluding to the rural scene before it, has the following lines from Virgil:<Q><L>— " Hic latis otia fundis</L>
<L>" Speluncae, vivique lacus, hic frigida Tempe,</L>
<L>" Mugitusque boum, mollesque sub arbore somni<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>Here tranquil leisures in the ample field,</L>
<L>Here caves and living lakes their pleasures yield;</L>
<L>Here vales invite where sports the cooling breeze,</L>
<L>And peaceful sleep beneath embow'ring trees,</L>
<L>While lowing herds surround.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q> Here the eye looking down a slope beneath the spread∣ing arms of oak and beech trees, passes first over some rough furzy ground, then over water to the large swelling lawn, in the centre of which the house is dis∣covered among trees and thickets: this forms the fore ground. Beyond this appears a swell of waste furzy land, diversified with a cottage, and a road that winds behind a farm-house and a fine clump of trees. The back scene of all is a semicircular range of hills, diversified with woods, scenes of cultivation, and in∣closures, to about four or five miles' distance.</P>
<P>Still winding up into the wood, we come to a slight seat, opening through the trees to a bridge of five
<PB N="xli" REF="41"/>
piers, crossing a large piece of water at about half a mile's distance. The next seat looks down from a considerable height, along the side of a steep preci∣pice, upon irregular and pleasing ground. And now we turn upon a sudden into a long straight-lined walk in the wood, arched over with tall trees, and termi∣nating with a small rustic building. Though the walk, as I said, be straight-lined, yet the base rises and falls so agreeably, as leaves no room to censure its forma∣lity. About the middle of this avenue, which runs the whole length of this hanging wood, we arrive unexpectedly at a lofty Gothic seat, whence we look down a slope, more considerable than that before mentioned, through the wood on each side. This view is indeed a fine one, the eye first travelling down over well-variegated ground into the valley, where is a large piece of water, whose sloping banks give all the appearance of a noble river. The ground from hence rises gradually to the top of Clent hill, at three or four miles' distance, and the landscape is enriched with a view of Hales Owen, the late Lord Dudley's house, and a large wood of Lord Lyttleton's. It is impossible to give an adequate description of this view, the beauty of it depending upon the great va∣riety of objects and beautiful shape of ground, and all at such a distance as to admit of being seen distinctly.</P>
<P>Hence we proceed to the rustic building before mentioned, a slight and unexpensive edifice, formed
<PB N="xlii" REF="42"/>
of rough unhewn stone, commonly called here The Temple of Pan, having a trophy of the Tibia and Syrinx, and this inscription over the entrance:
<Q><L>" Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures</L>
<L>" Edocuit; Pan curat oves, oviumque magistros<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>Pan, god of shepherds, first inspir'd our swains</L>
<L>Their pipes to frame, and tune their rural strains;</L>
<L>Pan from impending harm the fold defends,</L>
<L>And Pan the master of the fold befriends.</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q>
Hence mounting once more to the right, through this dark umbrageous walk, we enter at once upon a lightsome high natural terrace, whence the eye is thrown over all the scenes we have seen before, to∣gether with many fine additional ones, and all be∣held from a declivity that approaches as near a pre∣cipice as is agreeable. In the middle is a seat with this inscription:
<Q>Divini gloria rvris<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION.<Q>

O glory of the sylvan scene divine!</Q></P></NOTE>!</Q>
To give a better idea of this, by far the most magni∣ficent scene here, it were, perhaps, best to divide it into two distinct parts—the noble concave in the front, and the rich valley towards the right.—In re∣gard to the former, if a boon companion could en∣large his idea of a punch-bowl, ornamented within with all the romantic scenery the Chinese ever yet devised, it would, perhaps, afford him the highest idea he could possibly conceive of earthly happiness:
<PB N="xliii" REF="43"/>
he would certainly wish to swim in it. Suffice it to say, that the horizon, or brim, is as finely varied as the cavity. It would be idle here to mention the Clee hills, the Wrekin, the Welsh mountains, or Caer Ca∣radoc, at a prodigious distance; which, though they finish the scene agreeably, should not be mentioned at the Leasowes, the beauty of which turns chiefly upon distinguishable scenes. The valley upon the right is equally enriched, and the opposite side thereof well fringed with woods, and the high hills on one side this long winding vale rolling agreeably into the hol∣lows on the other. But these are a kind of objects which, though really noble in the survey, will not strike a reader in description as they would a specta∣tor upon the spot.</P>
<P>Hence returning back into the wood, and crossing Pan's Temple, we go directly down the slope into another part of Mr. Shenstone's grounds, the path leading down through very pleasing home-scenes of well-shaped ground, exhibiting a most perfect concave and convex, till we come at a seat under a noble beech, presenting a rich variety of fore-ground, and at, perhaps, half a mile's distance, the Gothic alcove on a hill well covered with wood, a pretty cottage un∣der trees in the more distant part of the concave, and a farm-house upon the right, all picturesque objects.</P>
<P>The next and the subsequent seat afford pretty much the same scenes a little enlarged, with the addition
<PB N="xliv" REF="44"/>
of that remarkable clump of trees called Frankly Beeches, adjoining to the old family-seat of the Lyt∣tletons, and from whence the present Lord Lyttle∣ton derives his title.</P>
<P>We come now to a handsome Gothic screen, backed with a clump of firs, which throws the eye in front full upon a cascade in the valley, issuing from beneath a dark shade of poplars. The house appears in the centre of a large swelling lawn, bushed with trees and thicket. The pleasing variety of easy swells and hol∣lows, bounded by scenes less smooth and cultivated, affords the most delightful picture of domestic retire∣ment and tranquillity.</P>
<P>We now descend to a seat inclosed with handsome pales, and backed with firs, inscribed to Lord Lyt∣tleton. It presents a beautiful view up a valley con∣tracted gradually, and ending in a group of most magnificent oaks and beeches. The right-hand side is enlivened with two striking cascades, and a wind∣ing stream seen at intervals between tufts of trees and woodland. To the left appears the hanging wood already mentioned, with the Gothic screen on the slope in the centre.</P>
<P>Winding still downwards, we come to a small seat, where one of the offices of the house, and a view of a cottage on very high ground, is seen over the tops of the trees of the grove in the adjacent valley, giving an agreeable instance of the abrupt inequality of
<PB N="xlv" REF="45"/>
ground in this romantic well-variegated country. The next seat shews another face of the same valley, the water gliding calmly along betwixt two seeming groves without any cascade, as a contrast to the former one, where it was broken by cascades: the scene very sig∣nificantly alluded to by the motto,
<Q><L>" Rura mihi, et rigul placeant in vallibus amnes,</L>
<L>" Flumina amem, silvasque inglorius<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>Woods, vales, and running streams, my mind enchant;</L>
<L>The woods and streams inglorious let me haunt.</L></Q></P></NOTE>!"</L></Q></P>
<P>We descend now to a beautiful gloomy scene, call∣ed Virgil's Grove, where, on the entrance, we pass by a small obelisk on the right hand, with this in∣scription:
<Q>P. Virgilio Maroni <LB/>Lapis iste cvm lvco sacer esto<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>To <LB/>P. Virgilius Maro, <LB/>This obelisk <LB/>and grove <LB/>is consecrated<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note.</HI>—It was customary with the Romans to give a praenomen, or first name, in the manner of our Christian names; accordingly Virgil had that of Publius. He derived the addition of Maro from his father, who was so called.</NOTE>.</Q></P></NOTE></Q>
Before this is a slight bench, where some of the same objects are seen again, but in a different point of light. It is not very easy either to paint or describe this delightful grove: however, as the former has been more than once attempted, I will hope to apologize for an imperfect description, by the difficulty found
<PB N="xlvi" REF="46"/>
by those who have aimed to sketch it with their pen∣cil. Be it, therefore, first observed, that the whole scene is opaque and gloomy, consisting of a small deep valley or dingle, the sides of which are inclosed with irregular tufts of hazel and other underwood, and the whole overshadowed with lofty trees rising out of the bottom of the dingle, through which a copious stream makes its way through mossy banks, enamelled with primroses, and variety of wild wood flowers. The first seat we approach is thus inscribed:<Q>Celeberrimo Poetae <LB/>IACOBO THOMSON, <LB/>Prope fontes illi non fastiditos <LB/>G. S. <LB/>Sedem hanc ornavit<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>To the much celebrated Poet JAMES THOMSON, This seat was placed near his favourite springs by W. S.</Q></P></NOTE>.<L>" Quae tibi, quae tali reddam pro carmine dona?</L>
<L>" Nam neque me tantum venientis sibilus austri,</L>
<L>" Nec percussa juvant fluctu tam littora, nec quae</L>
<L>" Saxosas inter decurrunt fl umina valles<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>How shall I thank thy Muse, so form'd to please?</L>
<L>For not the whisp'rings of the southern breeze,</L>
<L>Nor banks still-beaten by the breaking wave,</L>
<L>Nor limpid rills that pebbly vallies lave,</L>
<L>Yield such delight.—</L></Q></P></NOTE>."</L></Q>

This seat is placed upon a steep bank on the edge of the valley, from which the eye is here drawn down
<PB N="xlvii" REF="47"/>
into the flat below, by the light that glimmers in front, and by the sound of various cascades, by which the winding stream is agreeably broken. Opposite to this seat the ground rises again in an easy concave to a kind of dripping fountain, where a small rill trickles down a rude nich of rock-work, through fern, liver∣wort, and acquatic weeds, the green area in the mid∣dle, through which the stream winds, being as well shaped as can be imagined. After falling down these cascades, it winds under a bridge of one arch, and then empties itself into a small lake which catches it a little below. This terminates the scene upon the right; and after these objects have for some time a∣mused the spectator, his eye rambles to the left, where one of the most beautiful cascades imaginable is seen, by way of incident, through a kind of vista or glade, falling down a precipice overarched with trees, and strikes us with surprise. It is impossible to express the pleasure which one feels on this occasion; for though surprise alone is not excellence, it may serve to quicken the effect of what is beautiful. I believe none ever beheld this grove without a thorough sense of satisfaction; and were one to chuse any particular spot of this perfectly Arcadian farm, it should, per∣haps, be this; although it so well contrasts both with the terrace and with some other scenes, that one can∣not wish them ever to be divided. We now proceed to a seat at the bottom of a large root on the side of a slope, with this inscription:</P>
<P><PB N="xlviii" REF="48"/>INSCRIPTION.<Q><LG>
<L>' O let me haunt this peaceful shade,</L>
<L>' Nor let Ambition e'er invade</L>
<L>' The tenants of this leafy bower,</L>
<L>' That shun her paths, and slight her power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' Hither the peaceful halcyon flies</L>
<L>' From social meads and open skies,</L>
<L>' Pleas'd by this rill her course to steer,</L>
<L>' And hide her sapphire plumage here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' The trout, bedropp'd with crimson stains,</L>
<L>' Forsakes the river's proud domains,</L>
<L>' Forsakes the sun's unwelcome gleam,</L>
<L>' To lurk within this humble stream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>' And sure I hear the Naiad say,</L>
<L>" Flow, flow, my Stream! this devious way;</L>
<L>" Tho' lovely soft thy murmurs are,</L>
<L>" Thy waters lovely, cool, and fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Flow, gentle Stream! nor let the vain</L>
<L>" Thy small unsully'd stores disdain;</L>
<L>" Nor let the pensive sage repine,</L>
<L>" Whose latent course resembles thine."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The view from it is a calm tranquil scene of water, gliding through sloping ground, with a sketch through the trees of the small pond below.</P>
<P>The scene in this place is that of water stealing a∣long through a rude sequestered vale, the ground on each side covered with weeds and field flowers, as that before is kept close shaven. Farther on we lose all sight of water, and only hear the noise, without ha∣ving the appearance; a kind of effect which the Chi∣nese are fond of producing in what they call their Scenes of enchantment. We now turn, all on a sudden, upon the high cascade which we admired before in
<PB N="xlix" REF="49"/>
vista. The scene around is quite a grotto of native stone running up it, roots of trees overhanging it, and the whole shaded over head. However, we first ap∣proach, upon the left, a chalybeat spring, with an iron bowl chained to it, and this inscription upon a stone:
<Q>Fons Ferrvginevs <LB/>Divae qvae secessv isto frvi concedit<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>To the Goddess <LB/>who bestowed the enjoyment <LB/>of these retreats, <LB/>This chalybeat spring <LB/>is consecrated.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q>
Then turning to the right, we find a stone seat, ma∣king part of the aforesaid cave, with this well-applied inscription:
<Q><L>Intus aqvae dulces, vivoqve sedilia saxo;</L>
<L>Nympharvm domvs<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>IMITATION.<Q>

<L>Within are wholesome springs, and marble seats</L>
<L>Carv'd in the living rock, of Nymphs the bless'd retreats.</L></Q></P></NOTE>.</L></Q>
which I have often heard Mr. Shenstone term the definition of a grotto. We now wind up a shady path on the left hand, and crossing the head of this cas∣cade, pass beside the river that supplies it in our way up to the house. One seat first occurs under a shady oak as we ascend the hill; soon after we enter the shrubbery, which half surrounds the house, where we find two seats, thus inscribed to two of his most par∣ticular friends. The first thus:<Q><PB N="l" REF="50"/>
Amicitiae et meritis <LB/>RICHARDI GRAVES<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>To the <LB/>friendship and merits <LB/>of <LB/>RICHARD GRAVES.</Q></P></NOTE>:
<LB/>Ipsae te, Tityre! pinvs, <LB/>Ipsi te fontes, ipsa haec arbvsta, vocabant<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>Thee, Tityrus! the pines <LB/>The crystal springs, the very groves, invok'd.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q> and a little further the other, with the following in∣scription:
<Q>Amicitiae et meritis <LB/>RICHARDI JAGO<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q>To the <LB/>friendship and merits <LB/>of <LB/>RICHARD JAGO.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q>
From this last is an opening down the valley over a large sliding lawn, well edged with oaks, to a piece of water crossed by a considerable bridge in the flat—the steeple of Hales, a village amid trees, making on the whole a very pleasing picture. Thus winding through flowering shrubs, beside a menageric for doves, we are conducted to the stables. But let it not be forgot, that on the entrance into this shrub∣bery the first object that strikes us is a Venus de Me∣dicis, beside a bason of gold-fish, encompassed round with shrubs, and illustrated with the following in∣scription;<Q><PB N="li" REF="51"/><LG>
<HEAD>—"Semi-reducta Venus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>EXPLANATION. <Q REND="inline">Venus half-retired.</Q></P></NOTE>."</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>" To Venus, Venus here retir'd,</L>

<L>" The bold, the pert, the gay;</L>
</LG>

<L>" Why don't ye play?—the girl's afraid—</L>
<L N="5">" Play something—any thing—but play—</L>
<L>" 'Tis but to pass the time away—</L>
<L>" Phoo—how she stands—biting her nails—</L>

" That card will do—'blood never doubt it,</L>
<L>" Its not worth while to think about it."</L>

<LG>
<L>Sal thought, and thought, and miss'd her aim,</L>
<L>And Ned, ne'er studying, won the game.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="15">Methinks, old Friend! 'tis wondrous true</L>
<L>That verse is but a game at loo:</L>
<L>While many a bard, that shews so clearly</L>
<L>He writes for his amusement merely,</L>
<L>Is known to study, fret, and toil,</L>
<L N="20">And play for nothing all the while,</L>
<L>Or praise at most, for wreaths of yore</L>
<L>Ne'er signify'd a farthing more,</L>
<L>Till having vainly toil'd to gain it,</L>
<L>He sees your flying pen obtain it.</L>
</LG>

<L>You now none other flame require</L>
<L N="30">Than a good blazing parlour fire;</L>
<L>Write verses—to defy the scorners</L>
<L>In shit-houses and chimney-corners.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sal found her deep-laid schemes were vain—</L>
<L>The cards are cut—come, deal again—</L>
<L N="35">No good comes on it when one lingers—</L>
<L>I'll play the cards come next my fingers—</L>
<L>Fortune could never let Ned loo her,</L>

<L>Well, now who wins?—why, still the same—</L>
<L N="40">For Sal has lost another game.</L>

<L>" I've done, (she mutter'd;) I was saying,</L>
<L>" It did not argufy my playing.</L>
<L>" Some folks will win, they cannot chuse,</L>

<L>" I won it of a baby then—</L>
<L>" Give me an ace of trumps, and see!</L>
<L N="50">" Our Ned will beat me with a three!</L>
<L>" 'Tis all by luck that things are carry'd—</L>
<L>" He'll suffer for it when he's marry'd."</L>

<L>Thus Sal, with tears in either eye,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="55">Thus I, long envying your success,</L>

<L>Snatch from the hedge a sprig of bay,</L>
<L>Accept this verse, howe'er it flows,</L>
<L>From one that is your friend in prose.</L>

<LG>
<L N="65">What is this wreath, so green, so fair!</L>
<L>Which many wish, and few must wear?</L>
<L><PB N="167" REF="167"/>
Which some men's indolence can gain,</L>

<L>For what must Sal or poet sue,</L>

<L>For luck in verse, for luck at loo?</L>

<L>As Lucian tells us, in his fashion,</L>
<L N="80">How souls put off each earthly passion,</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="174"/>
Ere on Elysium's flow'ry strand</L>
<L>Old Charon suffer'd 'em to land;</L>
<L>So, ere we meet a court's caresses,</L>
<L>No doubt our souls must change their dresses;</L>
<L N="85">And souls there be who, bound that way,</L>
<L>Attire themselves ten times a-day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If then 'tis rank which all men covet,</L>
<L>And saints alike and sinners love it;</L>
<L>If place, for which our courtiers throng</L>
<L N="90">So thick, that few can get along,</L>
<L>For which such servile toils are seen,</L>
<L>Who's happier than a king?—a queen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Howe'er men aim at elevation,</L>
<L>'Tis properly a female passion:</L>
<L N="95">Women and beaus, beyond all measure,</L>
<L>Are charm'd with rank's ecstatic pleasure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sir, if your drift I rightly scan,</L>
<L>You'd hint a beau were not a man:</L>
<L>Say women then are fond of places;</L>
<L N="100">I wave all disputable cases.</L>
<L>A man, perhaps, would something linger,</L>
<L>Were his lov'd rank to cost—a finger;</L>
<L>Or were an ear or toe the price on't,</L>
<L>He might delib'rate once or twice on't,</L>
<L N="105">Perhaps ask Gataker's advice on't;</L>
<L>And many, as their frame grows old,</L>
<L>Would hardly purchase it with gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="175" REF="175"/>
<L>But women wish Precedence ever;</L>
<L>'Tis their whole life's supreme endeavour;</L>
<L N="110">It fires their youth with jealous rage,</L>
<L>And strongly animates their age:</L>
<L>Perhaps they would not sell outright,</L>
<L>Or maim a limb—that was in sight;</L>
<L>Yet on worse terms they sometimes chuse it,</L>
<L N="115">Nor ev'n in punishments refuse it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Preeminence in pain! you cry,</L>
<L>All fierce and pregnant with reply:</L>

<L>He rose one morn at break of day,</L>

When, lo! a brace of girls appears,</L>

<L N="5">To guard his flocks, to fence his flowers,</L>

<L>Tho' school'd from Fortune's paths to fly,</L>

<L>O how sudden the jessamine strove</L>
<L>With the lilac to render it gay!</L>
<L>Already it calls for my love</L>
<L>To prune the wild branches away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="25">From the plains, from the woodlands, and groves,</L>
<L>What strains of wild melody flow!</L>
<L>How the nightingales warble their loves</L>
<L>From thickets of roses that blow!</L>
<L>And when her bright form shall appear,</L>
<L N="30">Each bird shall harmoniously join</L>
<L>In a concert so soft and so clear,</L>
<L>As—she may not be fond to resign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I have found out a gift for my fair;</L>
<L>I have found where the wood-pigeons breed;</L>
<L N="35">But let me that plunder forbear,</L>
<L>She will say 'twas a barbarous deed:</L>
<L>For he ne'er could be true, she averr'd,</L>
<L>Who could rob a poor bird of its young;</L>
<L>And I lov'd her the more when I heard</L>
<L N="40">Such tenderness fall from her tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="193" REF="193"/>
<L>I have heard her with sweetness unfold</L>
<L>How that pity was due to—a dove;</L>
<L>That it ever attended the bold,</L>
<L>And she call'd it the sister of Love.</L>
<L N="45">But her words such a pleasure convey,</L>
<L>So much I her accents adore,</L>
<L>Let her speak, and whatever she say,</L>
<L>Methinks I should love her the more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can a bosom so gentle remain</L>
<L N="50">Unmov'd when her Corydon sighs!</L>
<L>Will a nymph that is fond of the plain,</L>
<L>These plains and this valley despise?</L>
<L>Dear regions of silence and shade!</L>
<L>Soft scenes of contentment and ease!</L>
<L N="55">Where I could have pleasingly stray'd,</L>
<L>If aught in her absence could please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But where does my Phyllida stray?</L>
<L>And where are her grots and her bow'rs?</L>
<L>Are the groves and the vallies as gay,</L>
<L N="60">And the shepherds as gentle, as ours?</L>
<L>The groves may perhaps be as fair,</L>
<L>And the face of the vallies as fine,</L>
<L>The swains may in manners compare,</L>
<L N="64">But their love is not equal to mine.</L>

<HEAD>III. SOLICITUDE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHY will you my passion reprove?</L>
<L>Why term it a folly to grieve?</L>
<L>Ere I shew you the charms of my love,</L>
<L>She is fairer than you can believe.</L>
<L N="5">With her mien she enamours the brave,</L>
<L>With her wit she engages the free,</L>
<L>With her modesty pleases the grave;</L>
<L>She is ev'ry way pleasing to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O you that have been of her train,</L>
<L N="10">Come and join in my amorous lays!</L>
<L>I could lay down my life for the swain</L>
<L>That will sing but a song in her praise.</L>
<L>When he sings, may the nymphs of the town</L>
<L>Come trooping, and listen the while;</L>
<L N="15">Nay, on him let not Phyllida frown,</L>
<L>—But I cannot allow her to smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For when Paridel tries in the dance</L>
<L>Any favour with Phyllis to find,</L>
<L>O how with one trivial glance</L>
<L N="20">Might she ruin the peace of my mind!</L>
<L>In ringlets he dresses his hair,</L>
<L>And his crook is bestudded around;</L>
<L>And his pipe—oh! may Phyllis beware</L>
<L>Of a magic there is in the sound!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="195" REF="195"/>
<L N="25">'Tis his with mock passion to glow;</L>
<L>'Tis his in smooth tales to unfold</L>
<L>" How her face is as bright as the snow,</L>
<L>" And her bosom, be sure, is as cold:</L>
<L>" How the nightingales labour the strain,</L>
<L N="30">" With the notes of his charmer to vie;</L>
<L>" How they vary their accents in vain,</L>
<L>" Repine at her triumphs, and die."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To the grove or the garden he strays,</L>
<L>And pillages every sweet,</L>
<L N="35">Then suiting the wreath to his lays,</L>
<L>He throws it at Phyllis's feet.</L>
<L>" O Phyllis!" he whispers, "more fair,</L>
<L>" More sweet, than the jessamine's flow'r!</L>
<L>" What are pinks in a morn to compare?</L>
<L N="40">" What is eglantine after a show'r?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Then the lily no longer is white,</L>
<L>" Then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom,</L>
<L>" Then the violets die with despight,</L>
<L>" And the woodbines give up their perfume."</L>
<L N="45">Thus glide the soft numbers along,</L>
<L>And he fancies no shepherd his peer;</L>
<L>—Yet I never should envy the song,</L>
<L>Were not Phyllis to lend it an ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="196" REF="196"/>
<L>Let his crook be with hyacinths bound,</L>
<L N="50">So Phyllis the trophy despise;</L>
<L>Let his forehead with laurels be crown'd,</L>
<L>So they shine not in Phyllis's eyes.</L>
<L>The language that flows from the heart</L>
<L>Is a stranger to Paridel's tongue;</L>
<L>—Yet may she beware of his art,</L>
<L N="56">Or sure I must envy the song.</L>
</LG>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV. DISAPPOINTMENT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE Shepherds! give ear to my lay,</L>
<L>And take no more heed of my sheep;</L>
<L>They have nothing to do but to stray,</L>
<L>I have nothing to do but to weep.</L>
<L N="5">Yet do not my folly reprove;</L>
<L>She was fair—and my passion begun;</L>
<L>She smil'd—and I could not but love;</L>
<L>She is faithless—and I am undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps I was void of all thought;</L>
<L N="10">Perhaps it was plain to foresee</L>
<L>That a nymph so complete would be sought</L>
<L>By a swain more engaging than me.</L>
<L>Ah! love ev'ry hope can inspire,</L>
<L>It banishes wisdom the while,</L>
<L N="15">And the lip of the nymph we admire</L>
<L>Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="197" REF="197"/>
<L>She is faithless, and I am undone;</L>
<L>Ye that witness the woes I endure,</L>
<L>Let reason instruct you to shun</L>
<L N="20">What it cannot instruct you to cure.</L>
<L>Beware how you loiter in vain</L>
<L>Amid nymphs of an higher degree;</L>
<L>It is not for me to explain</L>
<L>How fair and how fickle they be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="25">Alas! from the day that we met</L>
<L>What hope of an end to my woes?</L>
<L>When I cannot endure to forget</L>
<L>The glance that undid my repose.</L>
<L>Yet time may diminish the pain:</L>
<L N="30">The flow'r, and the shrub, and the tree,</L>
<L>Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain,</L>
<L>In time may have comfort for me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sweets of a dew-sprinkled rose,</L>
<L>The sound of a murmuring stream,</L>
<L N="35">The peace which from solitude flows,</L>
<L>Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme.</L>
<L>High transports are shewn to the sight,</L>
<L>But we are not to find them our own;</L>
<L>Fate never bestow'd such delight</L>
<L N="40">As I with my Phyllis had known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="198" REF="198"/>
<L>O ye Woods! spread your branches apace,</L>
<L>To your deepest recesses I fly,</L>
<L>I would hide with the beasts of the chase,</L>
<L>I would vanish from every eye.</L>
<L N="45">Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove</L>
<L>With the same sad complaint it begun;</L>
<L>How she smil'd, and I could not but love!</L>
<L N="48">Was faithless, and I am undone!</L>
