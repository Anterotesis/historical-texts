<HEAD>THE NUN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WITH each Perfection dawning on her Mind,</L>
<L>All Beauty's Treasure opening on her Cheek,</L>
<L>Each flatt'ring Hope subdued, each Wish resign'd,</L>
<L>Does gay <HI>Ophelia</HI> this lone Mansion seek?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, gentle Maid, what prompts Thee to forsake</L>
<L>The Paths, thy Birth and Fortune strew with Flow'rs?</L>
<L>Thro' Nature's kind endearing Ties to break,</L>
<L>And waste in cloyster'd Walls thy pensive Hours?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let sober Thought restrain thine erring Zeal,</L>
<L>That guides thy Footsteps to the Vestal Gate,</L>
<L>Lest thy soft Heart (this Friendship bids reveal)</L>
<L>Like mine unblest shou'd mourn like mine too late.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<L>Does some angelic lonely-whisp'ring Voice,</L>
<L>Some sacred Impulse, or some Dream divine,</L>
<L>Approve the Dictates of thy early Choice?—</L>
<L>Approach with Confidence the aweful Shrine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There kneeling at yon Altar's marble Base</L>
<L>(While Tears of Rapture from thine Eye-lid steal.</L>
<L>And smiling Heav'n illumes thy Soul with Grace)</L>
<L>Pronounce the Vow, Thou never can'st repeal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if misled by false-entitled Friends,</L>
<L>Who say—"That Peace with all her comely Train,</L>
<L>"From starry Regions to this Clime descends.</L>
<L>"Smooths ev'ry Frown, and softens ev'ry Pain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"That Vestals tread Contentment's flow'ry Lawn,</L>
<L>"Approv'd of Innocence, by Health carest:</L>
<L>"That rob'd in Colours bright, by Fancy drawn,</L>
<L>"Celestial Hope sits smiling at their Breast."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<L>Suspect their Syren Song and artful Style,</L>
<L>Their pleasing Sounds some treach'rous Thought conceal:</L>
<L>Full oft does Pride with sainted Voice beguile.</L>
<L>And sordid Int'rest wear the Mask of Zeal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Tyrant-Abbess here perchance may reign,</L>
<L>Who, fond of Pow'r, affects th' Imperial Nod,</L>
<L>Looks down disdainful on her Female Train,</L>
<L>And rules the Cloyster with an Iron Rod.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reflection sickens at the Life-long Tie,</L>
<L>Back-glancing Mem'ry acts her busy Part,</L>
<L>Its Charms the World unfolds to Fancy's Eye,</L>
<L>And sheds Allurement on the wishful Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! Discord enters at the sacred Porch,</L>
<L>Rage in her Frown, and Terror on her Crest:</L>
<L>Ev'n at the hallow'd Lamps she lights her Torch,</L>
<L>And holds it flaming to each Virgin Breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<L>But since the Legends of Monastic Bliss</L>
<L>By Fraud are fabled, and by Youth believ'd,</L>
<L>Unbought Experience learn from my Distress,</L>
<L>Oh! mark my Lot, and be no more deceiv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Three Lustres scarce with hasty Wing were fled,</L>
<L>When I was torn from ev'ry weeping Friend,</L>
<L>A thoughtless Victim to the Temple led,</L>
<L>And (blush ye Parents) by a Father's Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet then what solemn Scenes deceiv'd my Choice?</L>
<L>The pealing Organ's animating Sound,</L>
<L>The choral Virgins' captivating Voice,</L>
<L>The blazing Altar, and the Priests around:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Train of Youths array'd in purest white,</L>
<L>Who scatter'd Myrtles as I pass'd along:</L>
<L>The thousand Lamps that pour'd a Flood of Light,</L>
<L>The Kiss of Peace from all the Vestal Throng:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>The Golden Censers toss'd with graceful Hand,</L>
<L>Whose fragrant Breath <HI>Arabian</HI> Odor shed:</L>
<L>Of meek-ey'd Novices the circling Band,</L>
<L>With blooming Chaplets wove around their Head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>—My willing Soul was caught in Rapture's Flame,</L>
<L>While sacred Ardor glow'd in ev'ry Vein:</L>
<L>Methought applauding Angels sung my Name,</L>
<L>And Heav'n's unsullied Glories gilt the Fane.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This temporary Transport soon expir'd,</L>
<L>My drooping Heart confess'd a dreadful Void:</L>
<L>E'er since, alas! abandon'd, uninspir'd,</L>
<L>I tread this Dome to Misery allied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No wakening Joy informs my sullen Breast,</L>
<L>Thro' opening Skies no radiant Seraph smiles,</L>
<L>No Saint descends to sooth my Soul to Rest,</L>
<L>No Dream of Bliss the dreary Night beguiles.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<L>Here hagard Discontent still haunts my View;</L>
<L>The sombre Genius reigns in ev'ry Place:</L>
<L>Arrays each Virtue in the darkest Hue,</L>
<L>Chills ev'ry Pray'r, and cancels ev'ry Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I meet her ever in the chearless Cell,</L>
<L>The gloomy Grotto and unsocial Wood:</L>
<L>I hear her ever in the Midnight Bell,</L>
<L>The hollow Gale, and hoarse-resounding Flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This caus'd a Mother's tender Tears to flow,</L>
<L>(The sad Remembrance Time shall ne'er erase)</L>
<L>When having seal'd th' irrevocable Vow</L>
<L>I hasten'd to receive her last Embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full-well she then presag'd my wretched Fate,</L>
<L>Th' unhappy Moments of each future Day:</L>
<L>When lock'd within this Terror-shedding Grate,</L>
<L>My joy-deserted Soul wou'd pine away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<L>Yet ne'er did her maternal Voice unfold</L>
<L>This cloyster'd Scene in all its Horror drest:</L>
<L>Nor did she then my trembling Steps withhold</L>
<L>When here I enter'd a reluctant Guest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! could she view her only Child betray'd,</L>
<L>And let Submission o'er her Love prevail?</L>
<L>Th' unfeeling Priest why did she not upbraid?</L>
<L>Forbid the Vow, and rend the hov'ring Veil?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! she might not—Her relentless Lord</L>
<L>Had seal'd her Lips, and chid her streaming Tear,</L>
<L>So Anguish in her Breast conceal'd its Hoard,</L>
<L>And all the Mother sunk in dumb Despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Thou who own'st a Father's sacred Name,</L>
<L>What Act impell'd thee to this ruthless Deed?</L>
<L>What Crime had forfeited my filial Claim?</L>
<L>And giv'n (oh blasting Thought!) thy Heart to bleed?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="10" MS="y"/>
<L>If then thine injur'd Child deserve thy Care,</L>
<L>Oh haste and bear her from this lonesome Gloom!</L>
<L>In vain—no Words can sooth his rigid Ear:</L>
<L>And <HI>Gallia</HI>'s Laws have riveted my Doom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye cloister'd Fair—ye censure-breathing Saints,</L>
<L>Suppress your Taunts, and learn at length to spare,</L>
<L>Tho' mid these holy Walls I vent my Plaints,</L>
<L>And give to Sorrow what is due to Pray'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I fled not to this Mansion's deep Recess,</L>
<L>To veil the Blushes of a guilty Shame,</L>
<L>The Tenor of an ill-spent Life redress,</L>
<L>And snatch from Infamy a sinking Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet let me to my Fate submissive bow:</L>
<L>From fatal Symptoms if I right conceive,</L>
<L>This Stream <HI>Ophelia</HI> has not to flow,</L>
<L>This Voice to murmur, and this Breast to heave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<L>Ah! when extended on th' untimely Bier</L>
<L>To yonder Vault this Form shall be convey'd,</L>
<L>Thoul't not refuse to shed one grateful Tear,</L>
<L>And breathe the <HI>Requiem</HI> to my fleeting Shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With pious Footstep join the sable Train,</L>
<L>As thro' the lengthening Isle they take their Way:</L>
<L>A glimmering Taper let thy Hand sustain,</L>
<L>Thy soothing Voice attune the funeral Lay:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold the Minister who lately gave</L>
<L>The sacred Veil, in Garb of mournful Hue,</L>
<L>(More friendly Office) bending o'er my Grave,</L>
<L>And sprinkling my Remains with hallow'd Dew:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As o'er the Corse he strews the rattling Dust,</L>
<L>The sternest Heart will raise Compassion's Sigh:</L>
<L>Ev'n then no longer to his Child unjust.</L>
<L>The Tears may trickle from <HI>a Father's</HI> Eye.</L>
