<HEAD>JOHN the SHOPKEEPER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS told you in a former lay,</L>
<L>How on a luckless evil day</L>
<L>The Trader John, a landsman brave,</L>
<L>Left the dry ground to try the wave.</L>
<L>But here the poet must rehearse,</L>
<L>In soft, and sweet, and tender verse,</L>
<L>How gentle Johnny had a wife,</L>
<L>The joy and solace of his life,</L>
<L>The sharer of his griefs and cares,</L>
<L>Privy to all his great affairs;</L>
<L>One who when ty'd in wedlock's noose</L>
<L>Had prov'd a helpmate sit for use;</L>
<L>One whom he married—not for whim—</L>
<L>But who could keep his house in trim;</L>
<L>No high-slown miss, or Belle, or Beauty,</L>
<L>A simple Girl that knew her duty;</L>
<L>Had well obey'd her Father, Mother,</L>
<L>And counsell'd well her younger Brother;</L>
<L>Healthy when young, and rather stout:</L>
<L>Moral?—nay more, she was devout:</L>
<L>And now a Christian quite at heart,</L>
<L>She carefully fulfils her part,</L>
<L>Well skill'd alike her house to guide,</L>
<L>And serve the shop at Johnny's side.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
See now she works to help the trade,</L>
<L>And now instructs her under maid;</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>But 'tis her chief and special care,</L>
<L>Her Husband's daily toil to spare;</L>
<L>When sick, or weary and opprest,</L>
<L>To ease the troubles of his breast,</L>
<L>To soothe his sorrows, calm his fears,</L>
<L>And help him thro' this vale of tears;</L>
<L>Remind him where his treasure lies,</L>
<L>And point to realms above the skies,</L>
<L>Where, when this shifting scene is o'er,</L>
<L>The faithful meet to part no more.</L>
<L>Now twenty summers or above</L>
<L>Have glided by and prov'd her love:</L>
<L>And though they may have marr'd her face,</L>
<L>Have ripen'd many a Christian Grace;</L>
<L>Hence it may now be fairly guess'd,</L>
<L>Her latest days shall be her best.</L>
<L>John knows her worth, and now-a-days,</L>
<L>He grows quite eager in her praise;</L>
<L>For ev'ry calling friend is told,</L>
<L>"My Wife is worth her weight in Gold."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To this blest couple there was born,</L>
<L>One Daughter cheerful as the morn;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
A Maiden she of spotless fame,</L>
<L>E'en in her mirth quite clear from blame.</L>
<L>Train'd in Religion's "narrow way,"</L>
<L>Her mind untainted by a Play,</L>
<L>She hates your giddy glitt'ring scenes,</L>
<L>Tho' long since enter'd on her teens;</L>
<L>Sees all things in a proper light,</L>
<L>And vice quite puts her in a fright;</L>
<L>Prompt and obedient from a Child,</L>
<L>Obliging, humble, meek and mild;</L>
<L>Still, before strangers, as a mouse;</L>
<L>Yet vastly useful in the House—</L>
<L>Toils for the shop, tho' seldom seen;</L>
<L>—Ah!—there she sits behind the screen;</L>
<L>There, like some flower both sweet and gay,</L>
<L>She shuns as yet the blaze of day;</L>
<L>(Well does her praise adorn my tale)</L>
<L>A new-blown Lily of the Vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now should perchance some fool draw near,</L>
<L>And get to whisper in her ear,</L>
<L>Of Plays, and Balls, and Fairs, and Races,</L>
<L>Fine mid-night Routs, and public Places,</L>
<L>And wonder how she can endure,</L>
<L>A life so useful and so pure—</L>
<L>Extol her form, her piercing Eyes,</L>
<L>And tell a hundred flatt'ring lies;</L>
<L>—While the sweet praise he thinks she sips,</L>
<L>The tortur'd Maiden bites her lips;</L>
<L>Thinks his fine flatt'ry mere pretence,</L>
<L>And longs to tell him to talk sense;</L>
<L>Yet dreads to take the dunce in hand,</L>
<L>Lest he should still not understand.</L>
<L>But should he let his <HI>vice</HI> peep out,</L>
<L>The meek-ey'd Girl can then turn stout;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
For once ('tis said) in terms direct,</L>
<L>A spruce and saucy spark she check'd;</L>
<L>(She grew so solemn in her speeches</L>
<L>The Bucks give out that "Nancy preaches")</L>
<L>And once put on the sweetest air,</L>
<L>And begg'd a Carman not to swear.</L>
<L>Thus while she spends her peaceful days,</L>
<L>Her parents' care she well repays;</L>
<L>Honors her father, loves her mother,</L>
<L>She'll prove methinks just such another;</L>
<L>And tho' scarce seen, except at church,</L>
<L>The men won't leave her in the lurch;</L>
<L>Some honest Christian man she'll strike,</L>
<L>No Buck or Blood—for like loves like.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next in my song, of equal fame,</L>
<L>Comes a good honest antient dame;</L>
<L>John's mother—with no fault but one—</L>
<L>I mean—she doated on her son;</L>
<L>For when her own dear spouse was gone,</L>
<L>Her whole affections fell to John;</L>
<L>'Twas then, the widow's age so great,</L>
<L>Her prospects small, her income strait,</L>
<L>That Johnny weighed the matter well,</L>
<L>And took her to his home to dwell:</L>
<L>No cost or trouble did he grudge,</L>
<L>For John had rightly learn'd to judge</L>
<L>That people, once of little fame,</L>
<L>But now of high and mighty name,</L>
<L>Oft owe the glory of their station,</L>
<L>To the mere help of Education.</L>
<L>Quoth he—"Were all men good and true,</L>
<L>"Their wealth, methinks, might half be due,</L>
<L>"To some good dame who now is found</L>
<L>"Quite thrust upon the mere back ground:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
"Besides (he added half in tears)</L>
<L>"A child is always in arrears,</L>
<L>"In debt, alas! o'er head and ears,"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh with what joy, what thanks and praise</L>
<L>To the Great Length'ner of her days,</L>
<L>What feelings not to be outdone,</L>
<L>Tow'rds her dear John, her only son,</L>
<L>Did the good parent take her station,</L>
<L>And kindly own the obligation!</L>
<L>And now his tenderness she pays,</L>
<L>By helping in a thousand ways.</L>
<L>Deck'd in her best she comes in view,</L>
<L>And serves the shop from twelve to two;</L>
<L>Knows not each price perhaps quite pat,</L>
<L>Yet keeps the croud in civil chat,</L>
<L>Till John himself comes up to sell</L>
<L>A yard of lutestring, or an ell:</L>
<L>Next to the Cook her aid she brings,</L>
<L>And does a hundred little things:</L>
<L>Loves her own self to lay the cloth,</L>
<L>To dress the sallad, skim the broth;</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>At shelling peas is quick and nimble,</L>
<L>Tho' now grown tardy with her thimble;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
And always puts you quite at ease,</L>
<L>Walks out, and leaves you if you please,</L>
<L>Plain as she seems, has much good sense.</L>
<L>And hence she never takes offence;</L>
<L>And all agree, for all are lenient,</L>
<L>The good old Lady's quite convenient.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet let me add, if things go wrong,</L>
<L>Madam soon shews her fears are strong;</L>
<L>And then she gives a certain spice</L>
<L>Of plain and downright good advice;</L>
<L>Talks in a most convincing tone</L>
<L>"Of what <HI>she's</HI> seen and what <HI>she's</HI> known;"</L>
<L>And in a way that vastly wins,</L>
<L>Will warn you of her own past sins:</L>
<L>Tranquil at eve, in elbow chair.</L>
<L>Tells what her former follies were;</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>Recounts her dangers, nice escapes,</L>
<L>Sad sufferings once, and aukward scrapes;</L>
<L>And while she paints her varied life,</L>
<L>Adds wisdom e'en to Johnny's wife;</L>
<L>John, warn'd of her each matter weighs,</L>
<L>And Nancy trembles and obeys.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<L>Thus some old seaman, once so brave,</L>
<L>And buffeted by wind and wave;</L>
<L>Of the rude seas too long the sport,</L>
<L>Enters at length some peaceful port;</L>
<L>Rejoices now no more to roam,</L>
<L>Yet acts as Pilot nearer home.</L>
