<HEAD>HONORIA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'YE hallow'd bells, whose voices thro' the air</L>
<L>'The awful summons of affliction bear:</L>
<L>'Ye slowly-waving banners of the dead,</L>
<L>'That o'er yon altar your dark horrours spread:</L>
<L>'Ye curtain'd lamps, whose mitigated ray</L>
<L>'Casts round the fane, a pale, reluctant day:</L>
<L>'Ye walls, ye shrines, by melancholy drest,</L>
<L>'Well do ye suit the fashion of my breast!</L>
<L>'Have I not lost what language can't unfold,</L>
<L>'The form of valour cast in beauty's mould!</L>
<L>'Th' intrepid youth the path of battle tried,</L>
<L>'And foremost in the hour of peril died.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>'Nor was I present to bewail his fate,</L>
<L>'With pity's lenient voice to soothe his state,</L>
<L>'To watch his looks, to read while death stood by,</L>
<L>'The last expression of his parting eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'But other duties, other cares impend,</L>
<L>'Cares that beyond the mournful grave extend:</L>
<L>'Now, now I view conven'd the pious train,</L>
<L>'Whose bosom sorrows at another's pain,</L>
<L>'While recollection pleasingly severe</L>
<L>'Wakes for the awful dead the silent tear,</L>
<L>And pictures (as to each her sway extends)</L>
<L>'The sacred forms of lovers, parents, friends.</L>
<L>'Now Charity a fiery seraph stands</L>
<L>'Beside yon altar with uplifted hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Yet, can this high solemnity of grief</L>
<L>'Yield to the youth I love the wish'd relief?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>'These rites of death—Ah! what can they avail?</L>
<L>'Honorius died beyond the hallow'd pale:</L>
<L>'Plung'd in the gulph of fear—distressful state!</L>
<L>'My anxious mind dares not enquire his fate:</L>
<L>'Yet why despond? cou'd one slight errour roll</L>
<L>'A flood of poison o'er the healthful soul?</L>
<L>'Had not thy virtues full sufficing pow'r</L>
<L>'To clear thee in the dread recording hour?</L>
<L>'Did they before the judge abash'd remain?</L>
<L>'Did they, weak advocates, all plead in vain?</L>
<L>'By love, by piety, by reason taught,</L>
<L>'My soul revolts at the blaspheming thought:</L>
<L>'Sure in the breast to pure religion true,</L>
<L>'Where virtue's templed, God is templed too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Then while th' august procession moves along,</L>
<L>'Midst swelling organs, and the pomp of song;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>'While the dread chaunt, still true to Nature's laws,</L>
<L>'Is deepen'd by the terrour-breathing pause;</L>
<L>'While 'midst encircling clouds of incense lost</L>
<L>'The trembling priest upholds the <HI>sacred host</HI>;</L>
<L>'Amid these scenes shall I forget my suit?</L>
<L>'Amid these scenes shall I alone be mute?</L>
<L>'Nor to the footsteps of the throne above</L>
<L>'Breathe the warm requiem to the youth I love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Now silence reigns along the gloomy fane,</L>
<L>'And wraps in dread repose the pausing strain:</L>
<L>'When next it bursts my humble voice I'll join,</L>
<L>'Disclose my trembling wish at mercy's shrine,</L>
<L>'Unveil my anguish to the throne above,</L>
<L>'And sigh the requiem to the youth I love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'—Does fancy mock me with a false delight,</L>
<L>'Or does some hallow'd vision cheer my sight?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>'Methinks, emerging from the gloom below,</L>
<L>'Th' immortal spirits leave the house of woe!</L>
<L>'Inshrin'd in glory's beams they reach the sky,</L>
<L>'While choral songs of triumph burst from high!</L>
<L>'See, at the voice of my accorded pray'r,</L>
<L>'The radiant youth ascend the fields of air!</L>
<L>'Behold!—He mounts unutterably bright,</L>
<L>'Cloath'd in the sun-robe of unfading light!</L>
<L>'Applauding seraphs hail him on his way,</L>
<L>'And lead him to the gates of everlasting day.'</L>

<HEAD>THE SOLDIER's FAREWELL ON THE EVE OF A BATTLE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NIGHT, expecting the dread morrow</L>
<L>Hover'd o'er the martial train,</L>
<L>Beauteous Alice, led by sorrow.</L>
<L>Hurried to the silent plain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Give the watch-word, the guard utter'd</L>
<L>'Loudly from his destin'd place;</L>
<L>'Lo! 'tis I, fair Alice mutter'd,</L>
<L>'Hast'ning to his fond embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<L>'Ever beauteous, faithful ever,</L>
<L>'Quick the gallant youth rejoin'd,</L>
<L>'Cruel death can only sever</L>
<L>'Hearts in love's strong links entwin'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Soon shall we be torn asunder,</L>
<L>'Therefore welcome art thou come;</L>
<L>'Till morn wakes the battle's thunder</L>
<L>'Rest thee on that broken drum:'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She sat down, in mind reviewing</L>
<L>Ills the morning might behold,</L>
<L>Tears still other tears pursuing,</L>
<L>Down her cheek in silence roll'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thoughts to other thoughts succeeding</L>
<L>O'er her mind incessant flow;</L>
<L>She, like meekness inly-bleeding,</L>
<L>Broods in stillness o'er her woe:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L>'Wherefore, Alice, dost thou ponder</L>
<L>'Evils that are fancy's brood;</L>
<L>'Sure our parting might be fonder</L>
<L>'Than beseems this silent mood?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Yet continue still to ponder</L>
<L>'Things thy voice wants pow'r to say,</L>
<L>'Thy dumb grief to me seems fonder,</L>
<L>'Than words deck'd in bright array.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She replied (her tears still gushing)</L>
<L>'What avails it to be brave?</L>
<L>'Thou, amidst the battle rushing,</L>
<L>'Here perchance may meet a grave:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Shou'd'st thou perish in the action,</L>
<L>'Where's the peace to soothe my care?</L>
<L>'All my life wou'd be distraction,</L>
<L>'Madness, wailing, and despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<L>'Still thou wert of gentlest carriage,</L>
<L>'Still affectionately true,</L>
<L>'And a lover still in marriage,</L>
<L>'And a friend and parent too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Cheer thee, cheer thee, best of women,</L>
<L>'Trust to the great Pow'r above;</L>
<L>'When I rush amidst the foemen,</L>
<L>'Heav'n may think on her I love:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Saving is the miser's pleasure,</L>
<L>'Spending is the soldier's thrift,</L>
<L>'Take this guinea, all my treasure,</L>
<L>'Take it as a parting gift.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Here end we this mournful meeting,</L>
<L>'Catch from my lips this fond sigh;</L>
<L>'If this be our last, last greeting,</L>
<L>'Know, that I was born to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<L>'See! the day-spring gilds the streamers</L>
<L>'Waving o'er the martial train;</L>
<L>'Now the hoarse drum wakes the dreamers,</L>
<L>'Ne'er perchance to dream again:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Hark, I hear the trumpet's clangor</L>
<L>'Bid the British youth excell;</L>
<L>'Now, now glows the battle's anger,</L>
<L>'Lovely Alice, fare thee well.'</L>

<HEAD>TO THE MEMORY OF A YOUNG LADY.</HEAD>
<L>ENDOW'D with all that Fortune cou'd bestow;</L>
<L>With brilliancy of wit and beauty's glow,</L>
<L>Francisca, rising to her fifteenth year,</L>
<L>Stood mid the virgin train without a peer:</L>
<L>Her conscious bosom throbb'd to virtue warm,</L>
<L>While diffidence still heighten'd ev'ry charm:</L>
<L>But Heav'n's decree forbad this beauty's queen</L>
<L>To act her part thro' beauty's short-liv'd scene:</L>
<L>A gradual illness on her figure prey'd,</L>
<L>And slowly, slowly sunk the fading maid:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="14"/>Torn from each wish to which her youth aspir'd,</L>
<L>Unfearing—uncomplaining—she expir'd:</L>
<L>Thus some faint lily to its mother-ground</L>
<L>In silence falls—while spring is blooming round.</L>

<HEAD>INSCRIPTION INTENDED FOR AN OLD THATCHED CHURCH.</HEAD>
<L>FAR from the splendour of a costly fane,</L>
<L>My low roof canopies the humble train:</L>
<L>Deep in my vaults divorc'd from human woes,</L>
<L>The life-worn, weary villagers repose:</L>
<L>When at my altar kneels the hamlet fair,</L>
<L>And to her God unveils her bosom'd care!</L>
<L>Or does the herdsman bend with grief distrest,</L>
<L>Kind comfort steals upon their lighten'd breast:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="16"/>Here too Religion weaves with viewless hand,</L>
<L>For spotless village hearts, the nuptial band,</L>
<L>And twines with many a charm the holy braid</L>
<L>That joins the lab'rer and the nut-brown maid.</L>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH of TWO FAVOURITE BIRDS.</HEAD>
<L>INVOLV'D in flame and suffocating breath</L>
<L>A hapless bird was doom'd to sudden death;</L>
<L>The female, touch'd at his uncommon fate,</L>
<L>Survey'd the form of her disfigur'd mate;</L>
<L>With drooping head, and shiv'ring wings she stood</L>
<L>In all the agony of widowhood!</L>
<L>At length, to grief's severest pow'r a prey,</L>
<L>She dropt—and sigh'd her little soul away.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="18"/>Ye wedded birds, tho' rigid be your doom,</L>
<L>Yet Anna <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Miss Ann Beauclerk.</NOTE> watches at your early tomb;</L>
<L>For you her flowing pity bursts restraint,</L>
<L>Your dirge is utter'd in her soft complaint,</L>
<L>Your elegy, without the poet's art,</L>
<L>Is writ by sorrow on the purest heart.</L>

<HEAD>THE OAK.</HEAD>
<L>MARK well yon tree, that shades the neighb'ring plain,</L>
<L>And looks the ancestor of this domain!</L>
<L>Beneath the slowly-waving branches hoar,</L>
<L>(Meet temple for a vow) this morn I swore,</L>
<L>To rear solicitous bright Friendship's flow'r,</L>
<L>And fence it from bleak Time's destructive pow'r:</L>
<L>To guard with holy care the tender frame,</L>
<L>And on the fragrant leaves inscribe his name,</L>
<L>Whose presence gilds with smiles this mild retreat,</L>
<L>Within whose breast the virtues love to meet:</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="20"/>Who woos coy science to frequent his scene,</L>
<L>And bids good nature gambol o'er the green:</L>
<L>I spoke the word—The solemn branches bow'd,</L>
<L>As conscious of the sacred deed I vow'd.</L>

<HEAD>SENSIBILITY.</HEAD>
<L>CELESTIAL spring! to Nature's favourites giv'n,</L>
<L>Fed by the dews that bathe the flow'rs of heav'n:</L>
<L>From the pure crystal of thy fountain flow</L>
<L>The tears that trickle o'er another's woe;</L>
<L>The silent drop that calms our own distress;</L>
<L>The gush of rapture at a friend's success;</L>
<L>Thine the soft show'rs down beauty's breast that steal</L>
<L>To soothe the heart-wounds they can never heal:</L>
<L>Thine too the tears of ecstasy that roll,</L>
<L>When genius whispers to the list'ning soul;</L>
<L>And thine the hallow'd flood that drowns the eye,</L>
<L>When warm Religion lifts the thought on high.</L>

<HEAD>MAY the 9th, 1779, MISS BOYLE's BIRTH DAY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OH, shade of Hanb'ry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir Charles Hanbury Williams.</NOTE>, from thy seat bestow</L>
<L>One transient aspect on this scene below:</L>
<L>This youngest flow'ret of thy bow'r survey,</L>
<L>Who meekly rears her head to welcome May,</L>
<L>And looks the lily of the primros'd dale,</L>
<L>Just breaking thro' its green o'ermantling veil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold the Mother <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Honourable Mrs. Walsingham.</NOTE> prompt (with skill refin'd)</L>
<L>To watch the dawning of a Daughter's mind:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="23"/>With those clear rays which her bright noon adorn,</L>
<L>She streaks and beautifies her pupil's morn:</L>
<L>Foe to th' enamel'd rules of Stanhope's art,</L>
<L>With Nature's sentiments she feeds the heart;</L>
<L>Whose strong ascendant in due time display'd</L>
<L>Shall as a buckler shield the tender maid,</L>
<L>When call'd to enter on her fate's career,</L>
<L>Thro' life's uncertain voyage she shall steer.</L>
<L>Methinks I now behold that future day,</L>
<L>When the light galley shall the fair convey:</L>
<L>I see this artless Cleopatra glide,</L>
<L>Hope at her helm, and Virtue at her side,</L>
<L>Firm (as her Father to repel the foe)</L>
<L>To meet when Heav'n ordains th' assailing woe.</L>
<L>Ah! new adventurer on the sea of life,</L>
<L>May'st thou ne'er meet the waves' insulting strife;</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="24"/>Ne'er may thy bark amidst the whirlwind's roar</L>
<L>Dash its young bosom on the bulging shore:</L>
<L>May halcyon stillness brood along the deep,</L>
<L>And treach'rous Syrens in some cavern sleep:</L>
<L>Allur'd by smiling skies, may playful gales</L>
<L>Toy round thy mast, and flutter in the sails.</L>
<L>Enough—To merriment the hours devote,</L>
<L>Each accent tune to laughing pleasure's note.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For thee the darling of these humble lays,</L>
<L>Whose early merit wakes the voice of praise,</L>
<L>From the bright date of this recorded day</L>
<L>Thou shalt be styled the Little Queen of May.</L>
