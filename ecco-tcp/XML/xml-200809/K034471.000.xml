<L>TELL me, ye Gods, ye arbiters of wit,</L>
<L>Who rule the heavens, or who lead the pit, <HI>addressing the gallery and pit,</HI></L>
<L>Whence comes it, in an age refin'd by taste</L>
<L>By science polish'd, and by judgement chaste,</L>
<L>We see the Muse, in dignity sublime,</L>
<L>Led on by prologue, ape-ing <HI>pantomime;</HI></L>
<L>Whose sportive fancy, and whose comic skill,</L>
<L>All must applaud—where <HI>Roscius</HI> guides the quill;</L>
<L>Yet when <HI>Melpomene</HI> in grief appears,</L>
<L>Her suff'ring virtue bath'd in sorrow's tears,</L>
<L>From Tyrant laws, or jealous love oppress'd,</L>
<L>Swelling with silence in her tortur'd breast.</L>
<L>How can the heart her genial impulse shew,</L>
<L>Feel as she feels, or weep another's woe;</L>
<L>When gay <HI>Thalia</HI> has so late possess'd</L>
<L>The laughing transports of the human breast?</L>
<L>Let each her province keep, let jocund mirth</L>
<L>To Epilogue alone give happy birth;</L>
<L>Ease the struck soul from ev'ry anxious fcar,</L>
<L>And wipe from beauty's check the silent tear.</L>

<L>Twice <HI>Metastasio</HI>'s wings have borne our Bayes,</L>

<L>Fir'd with success, he dares this awful night,</L>
<L>Cheer'd by your smiles to take a bolder flight;</L>
<L>Nor longer stoop beneath a foreign shade,</L>
<L>Like Dian shining from a borrow'd aid;</L>
<L>But comes impregnate with <HI>Icarian</HI> pride,</L>
<L>To stretch his pinnions, and forsake his guide;</L>
<L>Yet doubtful flies, lest vapours damp his force,</L>
<L>And one black cloud should stop his airy course,</L>
<L>To awful heights his proud ambition soars,</L>
<L>And the dread regions of applause explores;</L>

<L>JUDGES of Genius! from whose hands a bard</L>
<L>This night awaits the laurel of reward!</L>
<L>To you, the Tragic Muse, in <HI>Britain</HI>'s name,</L>
<L>Comes to announce the merits of his claim.</L>
<L>'Tis I have led him timorous to this field,</L>
<L>And bade him dare his country's guantlet wield;</L>
<L>Bade him aspire to vault her fiery breed,</L>
<L>Nor humbly stoop to mount the manag'd steed.</L>
<L>Long had I seen his patient merit toil,</L>
<L>In culling chaplets from a foreign soil;</L>
<L>Whilst, here, transplanted by his skilful hand,</L>
<L>Italia's honours bloom'd in <HI>Albion</HI>'s land.</L>
<L>Long had I mark'd, as such exotic boughs</L>
<L>Content he wove to veil his modest brows,</L>
<L>A spirit that in paths untrod before</L>
<L>Might snatch the nobler foliage of this shore.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the hopes, that I had now descry'd</L>
<L>A future son, from whom the buskin's pride</L>
<L>To this my favourite Isle, again might rise;</L>
<L>I touch'd his ear, and pointed out the prize.</L>
<L>"Wither my honours in this clime (I said)</L>
<L>"Buds here no bounteous leaf to deck thy head?</L>
<L>"Are these once fosiering skies so over-cast,</L>
<L>"That Genius dares not brave th' inclement blast?</L>
<L>"Come, let me lead thee, where my sons of yore</L>
<L>"In Fancy's fields amass'd their laureate store;</L>

"With active powers, aloft, bestrode the clouds</L>
<L>"Inspir'd by kind acclaims of shouting crowds.</L>

<L>"And saw a new creation wait his nod.</L>
<L>"Behold where Terror, with eccentric stride,</L>
<L>"Bursts, like a torrent from the mountain's side!</L>
<L>"Behold where gentle pity heaves the sigh,</L>
<L>"Sluicing the fruitful conduit of the eye!</L>
<L>"See love at whose approach, the airy Wiles</L>
<L>"Of Mirth and Freedom, or the jocund Smiles</L>
<L>"Of sweet content, dispers'd in wild affright,</L>
<L>"Mount on their silken wings and take their flight.</L>
<L>"See Jealousy his hideous form uprear,</L>
<L>"Tine the quick brand, and shake the vengeful spear:</L>
<L>"While, close behind, fell Anguish aud Disdain</L>
<L>"Stalk sullen by; and swell his gloomy train.</L>
<L>"Mark where Despair points to some distant ground;</L>
<L>"On blasted yews, where Night-birds shrick around,</L>
<L>"Where yawning Tombs add horror to the night,</L>
<L>"And Meteors flash their momentary light.</L>
<L>"Here mark thyself, what various objects rise,</L>
<L>"Nor trust the medium of another's eyes.'</L>

<L>I spoke—and Genius strait began to spread</L>
<L>His ready Plumage, and my voice obey'd,</L>
<L>Adventurous, thence he dares this night aspire</L>
<L>To stamp the vivid scene with native fire.</L>
<L>'Tis yours, ye Britons, then, with kind applause,</L>
<L>To fan the flame I kindled in your cause:</L>
<L>Nor be it said, when on your mercy thrown,</L>
<L>You foster every spark, but what's your own.</L>
<L>From your dread sentence, crown'd with laurels won,</L>
<L>I ardently expect to greet a Son:</L>

<L>AGENOR, still Bithynia must retain</L>
<L>The sword unsheath'd, and still remov'd afar,</L>
<L>Shall Peace, in vain desir'd, mock every hope,</L>
<L>Of dear domestic happiness—the leagues</L>
<L>Of factious princes, whose associate force</L>
<L>Has vex'd this bleeding land, now yield indeed</L>
<L>To Lycomedes' arms, or rather shrink</L>
<L>Before the genius of your noble friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Arsetes, bred in distant realms, and long</L>
<L>A wanderer o'er the face of earth, must hail</L>
<L>The hour that led his steps to tread your soil,</L>
<L>And gave him Teramenes for his friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tera.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tho' now the rage of civil strife is past,</L>
<L>Full well thou know'st, to-morrow's sun declin'd,</L>
<L>His next returning beam lights up the day</L>
<L>That ends the truce with Pontus, and demands</L>
<L>Our strongest force to meet a mightier foe,</L>
<L>In Artabasus.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Five returning suns</L>
<L>Have chang'd your vernal groves, since as the breath</L>
<L>Of Fame declares, your armies met and fought</L>
<L>On Hippias' banks, what time your martial powers</L>
<L>(Forgive me, if report mislead my tongue,)</L>
<L>Bow'd to a foreign standard.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tera.</SPEAKER>
<L>Lycomedes,</L>
<L>Whose thirst of glory in his vigorous life</L>
<L>Compell'd the neighbouring states to bend beneath</L>
<L>Bithynia's yoke; when creeping time had clogg'd</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
The vital springs, and kept his age from scenes,</L>
<L>Of active valour, by his generals still</L>
<L>Maintain'd the field, and thro' the nations spread</L>
<L>His martial terrors, till that fatal day,</L>
<L>When Hippias, down his current, dy'd with blood,</L>
<L>The frequent corse and glittering ensign bore:</L>
<L>Then, midst the slaughter, fell a sacrifice</L>
<L>To iron war, our king's lamented son;</L>
<L>A youth, the early darling of his sire,</L>
<L>The soldier's hope, and nursling of the field.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oft have I heard Polemon's name, whose brave</L>
<L>Unpractis'd arm encounter'd Artabasus,</L>
<L>And from his sword receiv'd a glorious death.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tera.</SPEAKER>
<L>But tho' the time's necessity compell'd</L>
<L>Bithynia to the truce, still, still the thought</L>
<L>Of his Polemon rankled in the bosom</L>
<L>Of our afflicted monarch, still the hope,</L>
<L>Tho' distant hope of vengeance, glow'd within,</L>
<L>And fed eternal hatred in his soul.</L>
<L>While now to Pontus' bounds, his army spreads</L>
<L>Its conquering legions, he forgoes the state</L>
<L>Of Nicomedias' palace, to reside</L>
<L>Amidst this city, whose opposing bulwarks</L>
<L>Rise on the kingdom's edge, and dare the foe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Fame speaks your rival great, and gives the praise</L>
<L>Of might and wisdom to the king of Pontus;</L>
<L>And more, 'tis said, his son, amidst the files</L>
<L>Of Rome's immortal legions, distant far</L>
<L>From Pontus, learns the rugged trade of war,</L>
<L>And gathers laurels in his blooming age,</L>
<L>That veterans view with envy: his return</L>
<L>Gives earnest of new triumphs.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tera.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let him come;</L>
<L>Would yet Arsetes aid Bithynia's cause</L>
<L>His sword with brave Orontes join'd, whose hand</L>
<L>Must sway the scepter of Bithynia's realm,</L>
<L>Might fix th' unsteady wing of victory</L>
<L>To Lycomedes' bands.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Orontes' valour</L>
<L>Your sovereign deems to merit Cleonice,</L>
<L>Whose piety forsakes the pomp of courts,</L>
<L>The splendid ease of female life, to attend</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
A father's steps, amidst the clang of war.</L>
<L>But for Arsetes, thou rememberest well</L>
<L>When first he join'd to thine his social arms,</L>

<L>To abide your welcome guest, and now the tenth</L>
<L>Wanes in her silver orb.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tera.</SPEAKER>
<L>What says Agenor?</L>
<L>My mind, tho' loth, recalls each circumstance.</L>
<L>But still I hop'd Arsetes might be won</L>
<L>To breathe our friendly air, still mix'd among</L>
<L>Bithynia's warlike sons, now hovering o'er</L>
<L>The verge of hostile Pontus, when the time</L>
<L>And place concurr'd to pour with sudden inroad</L>
<L>The storm of conquest on our hated foe,</L>
<L>To avenge a form, a worth so like his own—</L>
<L>—But see, he comes—</L>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ARSETES.</STAGE>
<L>Belov'd Arsetes, welcome!</L>
<L>Youth, at thy presence, buds with bloom renew'd,</L>
<L>Such as I was, when, on Arabia's sands,</L>
<L>I crush'd the wandering robbers of the desert.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arse.</SPEAKER>
<L>My lord, too partial friendship ever finds</L>
<L>New praise for your Arsetes; if I claim</L>
<L>Of merit aught, here Heaven receive my thanks,</L>
<L>That bade me wield the sword for Lycomedes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tera.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet Arsetes now methinks forgets</L>
<L>To prize our country's honours; while the bond</L>
<L>Of friendship holds no more his changing heart;</L>
<L>That heart, which once I press'd with transport here,</L>
<L>Which seem'd with mutual transport to receive</L>
<L>The love I proffer'd, when my bosom glow'd</L>
<L>With warmth of gratitude to him, whose arm</L>
<L>Snatch'd Teramenes from impending death,</L>
<L>As fierce Lysippus aim'd the threatening blade</L>
<L>At my defenceless head, when you rush'd in,</L>
<L>(Till then unknown) and sav'd me from the foe.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ars.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas sure some happy star, that led my steps</L>
<L>At that blest moment—if I sav'd the life</L>
<L>Of Teramenes, I preserv'd indeed</L>
<L>A faithful counsellor for Lycomedes,</L>
<L>An army's chief, but for myself a friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>And wilt thou, my Arsetes, now forsake</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
The bands, that late pursued the glorious task</L>
<L>Of conquest, taught by thee—now when the great,</L>
<L>Th' important moment comes, on which depends</L>
<L>Our monarch's fame, our vengeance—led by thee</L>
<L>And brave Orontes, we have stemm'd the tide</L>
<L>Of inbred tumult: every rebel head</L>
<L>Now lies subdued, and flush'd with great success,</L>
<L>Our soldiers now demand, with loud acclaim,</L>

<L>At length subsiding thro' your troubled state,</L>
<L>I must (forgive me, chief, forgive me, friend,)</L>

<L>Of him, whom once he fondly deem'd by fortune,</L>
<L>From all mankind selected for his friend.</L>

<L>Go on—</L>
<L>'Tis honest chiding—Shall a kingdom's heir,</L>

<L>Of thousands look for happiness, on whom</L>

<L>O! no—Agenor—thou hast fir'd my soul;</L>
<L>My father!—yes, I will embrace the knees</L>

<L>Yet never, Cleonice, shall this breast</L>

</SP>
<SP>

<L>And yet, my prince; the indulgent hand of fate,</L>

<L>May find a way to clear the gloomy prospect:</L>
<L>Discord perhaps may once again extinguish</L>
<L>Her hated torch that fires the rival nations,</L>
<L>And Cleonice be the bond of peace:</L>

<L>Alien from friends and home: tho' Artabasus</L>
<L>Sent you beneath my father's guardian care,</L>

<L>When fate (for sure 'twas more than common fortune)</L>
<L>Prompted my steps to tread Bithynia's realm,</L>

<L>Enough, my friends; enough—this life demands</L>

<L>Our first device against the feign'd Arsetes—</L>

The dazzling meteor that misled thy youth,</L>
<L>And even seduc'd thy age: the monarch fir'd</L>
<L>With false ambition for a conqueror's name,</L>
<L>Is but the lash of Jove to scourge mankind.</L>
<L>For thee, my son, by Lycomedes rais'd</L>
<L>To guide, with early hand, the reins of empire,</L>
<L>Remember what the duty of a king</L>
<L>Exacts, while each domestic bliss shall crown</L>
<L>Thy private hours, to watch thy people's weal,</L>
<L>And share, like Heaven, thy happiness with all.</L>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>OUR author, all submission, sends me here,</L>
<L>To make excuses for your simple cheer;</L>
<L>And I, that have no interest in his scenes,</L>
<L>Must bear the train of tragic kings and queens.</L>
<L>Shall I support the weakness of his Muse?—</L>
<L>Egad—if so—I'll fit him with abuse—</L>
<L>I'll soon dissect his fine-spun work, and show</L>
<L>That all his plot has more of farce than woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For, after all, the creature's much deceiv'd,</L>
<L>If e'er he thinks his tale can be believ'd.</L>
<L>So tame and so inanimate his maid is—</L>
<L>How very different from our modern ladies!—</L>
<L>What, could a blooming lass with ripen'd charms,</L>
<L>Be held so long from her admirer's arms?—</L>
<L>If such were truths in prudish Heathen climes,</L>
<L>Examples vary in our later times—</L>
<L>Then for theatric play—how poor! how cold!</L>
<L>A heroine's language should be nobly bold,</L>
<L>Outstrip the decency of vulgar life,</L>
<L>Mouth at the Heavens, and set the Gods at strife.—</L>
<L>Time was indeed, an antiquated bard</L>
<L>Paid to that beldame, Nature, some regard,</L>
<L>And drew his females with such simple features,</L>
<L>That all, who saw, believ'd them human creatures.</L>
<L>Plain <HI>Desdemona</HI> bore no trace of art,</L>
<L>And <HI>Portia</HI> play'd a wife's domestic part;</L>
<L>While <HI>Constance</HI> shew'd, but what before we knew,</L>
<L>And only griev'd, as real mothers do.—</L>
<L>Shall this stale poet give the Drama law,</L>
<L>Who poorly copied only what he saw?</L>
<L>Nay, stole from life, in every clime and age,</L>
<L>The characters that fill his boasted page?—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="55"/>
<L>Well! as I live, 'tis he!<HI>—(looking out)—</HI>O, axe you come?</L>
<L>Does all go well?—poor devil!—seal his doom.</L>
<L>This live-long night he watches every eye,</L>
<L>Talks, like his heroes, in soliloquy—</L>
<L>Then starts aside—"What! something goes amiss?—</L>
<L>"Sure 'tis the distant murmur of a hiss!"—</L>
<L>Alas! kind soul!—I pity his condition,</L>
<L>And will in his behalf this House petition:—</L>
<L>To you, good folks above, for ever ready</L>
<L>To serve a friend, all English hearts and steady!</L>
<L>To you, ye men of candour, sense, and wit,</L>
<L>Who fill the circle of this awful pit;</L>
<L>To you, ye ladies, ever prone to spare</L>
<L>The bard, who love and beauty makes his care;</L>
<L>I here commend him—take him to your favour,</L>
<L>And I'll be surety for his good behaviour.</L>
