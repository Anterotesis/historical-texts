<HEAD>The FOX-CHACE. A Favourite Hunting Song, <HI>Sung at the grand Hunts of England.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> SOUTHERLY wind and a cloudy sky,</L>
<L>Proclaims a Hunting Morning,</L>
<L>Before the sun rises, we nimbly fly,</L>
<L>Dull sleep, and a downy-bed scorning,</L>
<L>To Horse my Boys, to Horse away;</L>
<L>The Chace admits of no delay,</L>
<L>On Horseback we're got, together we'll trot,</L>
<L>On Horseback we're got, together we trot,</L>
<L>Leave of your chat see the cover appear;</L>
<L>The Hound that strikes first cheer him without fear,</L>
<L>Drag on him! Ah wind him my steady good hounds</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How compleatly the Cover and Furz they draw,</L>
<L>Who talks of Barry or Meynell,</L>
<L>Young La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her he flourishes now thro' the shaw;</L>
<L>And Saucebox roars out in his kennel,</L>
<L>Away we fly as quick as thought,</L>
<L>The new sown ground, soon makes them fault,</L>
<L>Cast round the sheeps train, cast round ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> round,</L>
<L>Try back the deep lane, try back try back,</L>
<L>Hark I hear some hounds challenge in yonder spring sedge,</L>

<L>Hark forward, hark forward, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> don't make a noise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A stormy sky overcharged with rain,</L>
<L>Both Hounds and Hunstman opposes,</L>
<L>In vain on your mettle you try boys in vain,</L>
<L>But down ye must to your noses,</L>
<L>Each moment now the sky grows worse,</L>
<L>Enough to make a Parson curse,</L>
<L>Pick through the plow'd grounds, pick through, pick through,</L>
<L>Well hunted good Hounds well hunted, well hunted,</L>
<L>If we can but get on, we shall soon make him quake</L>
<L>Hark I hear some hounds challenge in the midst of the brake,</L>
<L>Talio, Talio there across the green plain,</L>
<L>Talio, Talio, Boys have at him again.</L>

<L>Thus we ride whip and spur for a two hours Chace,</L>
<L>Our Horses go panting and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obbbing,</L>
<L>Young Madcap and Riot begin now race,</L>
<L>Ride on Sir and give him some mobbing,</L>
<L>But hold alass you'll spoil our sport,</L>
<L>For thro' the Hounds you'll head him short,</L>
<L>Clap round him dear Jack, clap round, clap round,</L>
