<SPEAKER>3d <HI>La.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, here you are musing and plotting mis∣chief against me, because the Sultan loves me; well, the woman who possesses his heart, is sure to have every woman in the Seraglio against her: but there was a time when you was kind to me.</P>

<P>Yes my dear Sophie, when you was in dis∣tress: and I assure you, that if ever that time should come again, we will be as kind again, and love you as well as ever.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d <HI>La.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You think so—however our sex are seldom kind to the woman that is so prosperous, their pity is

<P>I am afraid it is a great ravenous bird, co∣ming to devour us, is it a fowl? Perhaps it is the cha∣riot of some of the gods of the Gentoos.</P>

<P>Oh, no it cannot be a bird, it has no wings—perhaps this is our Prophet Mahomet coming to earth again, and this is his chariot—It is—they are gods, I see their heads. <STAGE>(Balloon descends)</STAGE> Let us not be afraid if they bear the shape of men (as gods they say mostly do) let us face them.</P>

<P>Christian ground you fool! why we're in Lim∣bo—it must be Limbo, or Greenland. Doctor what say you, it is Greenland, is it not?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why man Greenland is cold, quite reverse of this climate; this is either east, west or south, but which I cannot tell. I am sure it is not north, by the heat, other conclusions I draw from other causes; I know we are a thousand miles from our native land, from the swiftness of our machines motion, and the
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>length of time we have been in it; another conclusion is, that not knowing the paths we have come, we know not where we are—I know only that we are in a close walk of trees with houses at a distance; we may be amongst people, who pay no regard to genius, science, or inven∣tion, but may put us all to death, taking us for three witches that ride in the air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Lord! put us all to death!—is all our fine ride in the air come to this—Oh, Lord! O Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay Fan, and how the people clapp'd and huz∣za'd, when they saw us mount in the air!—They little thought they should not see us again, Gad that was the reason may be that they seem'd so glad—for my part I was so pleas'd with my journey, I was almost out of my wits for joy; I did not think that we should have no more than a couple of hours ride. I thought we should have been picked up in Essex, Darby, or Kent, or Middlesex or thereabouts, but the devil a bit! the Doc∣tor with all his magic could not stop it when it was set a-going.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
