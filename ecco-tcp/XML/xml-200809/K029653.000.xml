<HEAD>THE ACTOR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ACTING, dear <HI>Bonnell,</HI> it's Perfection draws</L>
<L>From no Observance of mechanic Laws.</L>
<L>No settled Maxims of a fav'rite Stage,</L>
<L>No Rules deliver'd down from Age to Age,</L>
<L>Let Players nicely mark them as they will,</L>
<L>Can e'er entail hereditary Skill.</L>
<L>If 'mongst the humble Hearers of the Pit,</L>
<L>At some lov'd Play the old Man chance to sit,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>Am I pleas'd more because 'twas acted so</L>
<L>By <HI>Booth</HI> and <HI>Cibber</HI> thirty Years ago?</L>
<L>The Mind recalls an Object held more dear,</L>
<L>And hates the Copy that it comes so near.</L>
<L>Why lov'd we <HI>Wilks's</HI> Air, <HI>Booth's</HI> nervous Tone?</L>
<L>In them 'twas natural, 'twas all their own.</L>
<L>A <HI>Garrick's</HI> Genius must our Wonder raise,</L>
<L>But gives his Mimic no reflected Praise.</L>
<L>Thrice happy Genius, whose unrival'd Name</L>
<L>Shall live for ever in the Voice of Fame!</L>
<L>'Tis thine to lead with more than magic Skill,</L>
<L>The Train of captive Passions at thy Will;</L>
<L>To bid the bursting Tear spontaneous flow</L>
<L>In the sweet Sense of sympathetic Woe.</L>
<L>Through ev'ry Vein I feel a Chilness creep,</L>
<L>When Horrors such as thine <HI>have murder'd Sleep.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>And at the old Man's Look and frantic Stare</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Lear</HI> alarms me, for I see him there.</L>
<L>Nor yet confin'd to tragic Walks alone</L>
<L>The comic Muse too claims thee for her own.</L>
<L>With each delightful Requisite to please,</L>
<L>Taste, Spirit, Judgment, Elegance, and Ease,</L>
<L>Familiar Nature forms thy only Rule,</L>
<L>From <HI>Ranger's</HI> Rake to <HI>Drugger's</HI> vacant Fool.</L>
<L>With Powers so pliant, and so various blest,</L>
<L>That what we see the last, we like the best.</L>
<L>Not idly pleas'd at Judgment's dear Expence</L>
<L>But burst ourageous with the laugh of Sense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PERFECTION'S Top with weary Toil and Pain</L>
<L>'Tis Genius only that can hope to gain.</L>
<L>The Play'r's Profession (tho' I hate the Phrase,</L>
<L>'Tis so <HI>mechanic</HI> in these modern Days)</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>Lies not in Trick, or Attitude, or Start,</L>
<L>Nature's true Knowledge is his only Art.</L>
<L>The strong-felt Passion bolts into the Face,</L>
<L>The Mind untouch'd, what is it but Grimace?</L>
<L>To this one Standard make your just Appeal</L>
<L>Here lies the golden Secret; learn to FEEL.</L>
<L>Or Fool or Monarch, happy or distrest,</L>
<L>No Actor pleases that is not <HI>possess'd.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ONCE on the Stage in <HI>Rome's</HI> declining Days,</L>
<L>When Christians were the Subject of their Plays,</L>
<L>Ere Persecution dropp'd her iron Rod,</L>
<L>And Mortals wag'd an impious War with God,</L>
<L>An Actor flourish'd of no vulgar Fame,</L>
<L>Nature's Disciple, and <HI>Genest</HI> his Name.</L>
<L>A noble Object for his Skill he chose,</L>
<L>A Martyr dying midst insulting Foes.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>Resign'd with Patience to Religion's Laws,</L>
<L>Yet braving Monarchs in his <HI>Saviour's</HI> Cause.</L>
<L>Fill'd with th' Idea of the sacred Part,</L>
<L>He felt a Zeal beyond the reach of Art,</L>
<L>While Look and Voice, and Gesture all exprest</L>
<L>A kindred Ardour in the Player's Breast,</L>
<L>Till as the Flame thro' all his Bosom ran,</L>
<L>He lost the Actor and commenc'd the Man:</L>
<L>Profest the Faith, his pagan Gods denied,</L>
<L>And what he acted then, he after died.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Player's Province they but vainly try,</L>
<L>Who want these pow'rs <HI>Deportment, Voice,</HI> and <HI>Eye.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Critic Sight 'tis only <HI>Grace</HI> can please</L>
<L>No Figure charms us if it has not <HI>Ease.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>There are who think the Stature all in all,</L>
<L>Nor like the Hero if he is not tall.</L>
<L>The feeling Sense all other Wants supplies,</L>
<L>I rate no Actor's Merit from his Size.</L>
<L>Superior Hight requires superior Grace,</L>
<L>And what's a Giant with a vacant Face?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEATRIC Monarchs in their tragic Gait</L>
<L>Affect to mark the solemn Pace of State.</L>
<L>One Foot put forward in Position strong,</L>
<L>The other like its Vassal dragg'd along.</L>
<L>So grave each Motion, so exact and slow,</L>
<L>Like wooden Monarchs at a Puppet-Show.</L>
<L>The Mien delights us that has native Grace</L>
<L>But Affectation ill supplies its Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<L>UNSKILFUL Actors, like your mimic Apes,</L>
<L>Will writhe their Bodies in a thousand Shapes;</L>
<L>However foreign from the Poet's Art,</L>
<L>No tragic Hero but admires a Start.</L>
<L>What though unfeeling of the nervous Line,</L>
<L>Who but allows his <HI>Attitude</HI> is fine?</L>
<L>While a whole Minute equipoiz'd he stands,</L>
<L>Till Praise dismiss him with her echoing Hands.</L>
<L>Resolv'd, though Nature hate the tedious Pause,</L>
<L>By Perseverance to extort Applause.</L>
<L>When <HI>Romeo</HI> sorrowing at his <HI>Juliet's</HI> Doom,</L>
<L>With eager Madness bursts the canvass Tomb,</L>
<L>The sudden Whirl, stretch'd Leg, and lifted Staff,</L>
<L>Which please the Vulgar, make the Critic laugh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<L>TO point the Passion's Force, and mark it well,</L>
<L>The proper Action Nature's Self will tell.</L>
<L>No pleasing Pow'rs Distortions e'er express,</L>
<L>And nicer Judgment always loaths Excess.</L>
<L>In Sock or Buskin who o'erleaps the Bounds,</L>
<L>Disgusts our Reason, and the Taste confounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OF all the Evils which the Stage molest</L>
<L>I hate your Fool who overacts his Jest.</L>
<L>Who murders what the Poet finely writ,</L>
<L>And like a Bungler haggles all his Wit,</L>
<L>With Shrug, and Grin, and Gesture out of Place,</L>
<L>And writes a foolish Comment with his Face.</L>
<L>Old <HI>Johnson</HI> once, tho' <HI>Cibber's</HI> perter Vein,</L>
<L>But meanly groupes him with a num'rous Train,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>With steady Face, and sober hum'rous Mien,</L>
<L>Fill'd the strong Outlines of the comic Scene.</L>
<L>What was writ down, with decent Utterance spoke,</L>
<L>Betray'd no Symptom of the conscious Joke;</L>
<L>The very Man in Look, in Voice, in Air,</L>
<L>And though upon the Stage, he seem'd no Play'r.</L>
<L>The Word and Action should conjointly suit,</L>
<L>But acting Words is labour too minute.</L>
<L>Grimace will ever lead the Judgment wrong,</L>
<L>While sober Humour marks th' Impression strong.</L>
<L>Her proper Traits the fixt Attention hit,</L>
<L>And bring me closer to the Poet's Wit;</L>
<L>With her delighted o'er each Scene I go,</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd, and not asham'd of being so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TIS not enough the <HI>Voice</HI> be sound and clear,</L>
<L>'Tis Modulation that must charm the Ear.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>When desperate Heroines grieve with tedious Moan,</L>
<L>And whine their Sorrows in a see-saw Tone;</L>
<L>The same soft Sounds of unimpassioned Woes</L>
<L>Can only make the yawning Hearers doze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Voice all Modes of Passion can express,</L>
<L>That marks the proper Word with proper Stress.</L>
<L>But none emphatic can that Actor call,</L>
<L>Who lays an equal Emphasis on <HI>all.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOME o'er the Tongue the labour'd Measures roll</L>
<L>Slow and delib'rate as the parting Toll,</L>
<L>Point ev'ry Stop, mark ev'ry Pause so strong,</L>
<L>Their Words, like Stage-Processions stalk along.</L>
<L>All Affectation but creates Disgust,</L>
<L>And e'en in speaking <HI>We</HI> may seem <HI>too</HI> just.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>Nor proper, <HI>Thornton,</HI> can those Sounds appear,</L>
<L>Which bring not Numbers to thy nicer Ear;</L>
<L>For them in vain the pleasing Measure flows</L>
<L>Whose Recitation runs it all to Prose;</L>
<L>Repeating what the Poet sets not down,</L>
<L>The Verb disjointing from its friendly Noun.</L>
<L>While Pause, and Break, and Repetition join</L>
<L>To make a Discord in each tuneful Line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOME placid Natures fill th' allotted Scene</L>
<L>With lifeless Drone, insipid and serene;</L>
<L>While others thunder ev'ry Couplet o'er,</L>
<L>And almost crack your Ears with Rant and Roar.</L>
<L>In so much Noise but little Sense is found,</L>
<L>As empty Barrels make the greatest Sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<L>MORE Nature oft and finer Strokes are shown,</L>
<L>In the low Whisper than tempestuous Tone.</L>
<L>And <HI>Hamlet's</HI> hollow Voice and fixt Amaze,</L>
<L>More powerful Terror to the Mind conveys,</L>
<L>Than he, who swol'n with big impetuous Rage,</L>
<L>Bullies the bulky Phantom off the Stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Modes of Grief are not included all</L>
<L>In the white Handkerchief and mournful Drawl;</L>
<L>A single Look more marks th' internal Woe,</L>
<L>Than all the Windings of the lengthen'd Oh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>UP to the <HI>Face</HI> the quick Sensation flies,</L>
<L>And darts its meaning from the speaking Eyes;</L>
<L>Love, Transport, Madness, Anger, Scorn, Despair,</L>
<L>And all the Passions, all the Soul is there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<L>IN vain <HI>Ophelia</HI> gives her Flowrets round,</L>
<L>And with her Straws fantastic strews the Ground;</L>
<L>In vain now sings, now heaves the desp'rate Sigh,</L>
<L>If Phrenzy sit not in the troubled Eye.</L>
<L>In <HI>Cibber's</HI> Look commanding Sorrows speak,</L>
<L>And call the Tear fast trick'ling down my Cheek.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE who in Earnest studies o'er his Part</L>
<L>Will find true Nature cling about his Heart.</L>
<L>All from their Eyes impulsive Thought reveal,</L>
<L>And none can want Expression, who can feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THERE is a Fault which stirs the Critic's Rage,</L>
<L>A Want of due Attention on the Stage.</L>
<L>There have been Actors, and admir'd ones too,</L>
<L>Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>In their own Speech who whine, or roar away,</L>
<L>Yet unconcern'd at what the rest may say.</L>
<L>Whose Eyes and Thoughts on diff'rent Objects roam</L>
<L>Until the Prompter's Voice recall them home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DIVEST yourself of Hearers if you can,</L>
<L>And strive to speak, and be the very Man.</L>
<L>Why should the well-bred Actor wish to know</L>
<L>Who sits above To-night, or who below.</L>
<L>So mid th' harmonious Tones of Grief or Rage,</L>
<L>Italian Squallers oft disgrace the Stage.</L>
<L>When with a simp'ring Leer, and Bow profound,</L>
<L>The squeaking <HI>Cyrus</HI> greets the Boxes round;</L>
<L>Or proud <HI>Mandane</HI> of imperial Race,</L>
<L>Familiar drops a Curtsie to her Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<L>TO suit the Dress demands the Actor's Art,</L>
<L>Yet there are those who over-dress the Part.</L>
<L>To some prescriptive Right gives settled Things,</L>
<L>Black Wigs to Murd'rers, feather'd Hats to Kings.</L>
<L>But <HI>Michel Cassio</HI> might be drunk enough,</L>
<L>Tho' all his Features were not grim'd with Snuff.</L>
<L>Why shou'd <HI>Pol Peachum</HI> shine in sattin Cloaths?</L>
<L>Why ev'ry Devil dance in scarlet Hose?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT in Stage-Customs what offends me most</L>
<L>Is the Slip-door, and slowly-rising Ghost.</L>
<L>Tell me, nor count the Question too severe,</L>
<L>Why need the dismal powder'd Forms appear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN chilling Horrors shake th' affrighted King,</L>
<L>And Guilt torments him with her Scorpion Sting;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>When keenest Feelings at his Bosom pull,</L>
<L>And Fancy tells him that the Seat is full,</L>
<L>Why need the Ghost usurp the Monarch's Place,</L>
<L>To frighten Children with his mealy Face?</L>
<L>The King alone should form the Phantom there,</L>
<L>And talk and tremble at the vacant Chair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF <HI>Belvidera</HI> her lov'd Loss deplore,</L>
<L>Why for twin Spectres bursts the yawning Floor?</L>
<L>When with disorder'd Starts, and horrid Cries,</L>
<L>She paints the murder'd Forms before her Eyes,</L>
<L>And still pursues them with a frantic Stare:</L>
<L>'Tis pregnant Madness brings the Visions there.</L>
<L>More instant Horror would enforce the Scene,</L>
<L>If all her Shuddrings were at Shapes unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
<L>POET and Actor thus with blended Skill,</L>
<L>Mould all our Passions to their instant Will;</L>
<L>'Tis thus, when feeling <HI>Garrick</HI> treads th' Stage,</L>
<L>(The speaking Comment of his <HI>Shakespear's</HI> Page.)</L>
<L>Oft as I drink the Words with greedy Ears,</L>
<L>I shake with Horror, or dissolve with Tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O ne'er may Folly seize the Throne of Taste,</L>
<L>Nor Dulness lay the Realms of Genius waste.</L>
<L>No bouncing Crackers ape the Thundrer's Fire,</L>
<L>No Tumbler float upon the bending Wire.</L>
<L>More natural Uses to the Stage belong,</L>
<L>Than Tumblers, Monsters, Pantomime, or Song.</L>
<L>For other Purpose was that Spot design'd;</L>
<L>To purge the Passions and reform the Mind,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>To give to Nature all the Force of Art,</L>
<L>And while it charms the Ear to mend the Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Thornton,</HI> to Thee I dare with Truth commend,</L>
<L>The decent Stage as Virtue's natural Friend.</L>
<L>Tho' oft debas'd with Scenes profane and loose,</L>
<L>No Reason weighs against it's proper Use.</L>
<L>Tho' the lewd Priest his sacred Function shame,</L>
<L>Religion's perfect Law is still the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall they who trace the Passions from their rise</L>
<L>Shew Scorn her Features, her own Image Vice;</L>
<L>Who teach the Mind it's proper Force to scan,</L>
<L>And hold the faithful Mirrour up to Man,</L>
<L>Shall their Profession e'er provoke Disdain,</L>
<L>Who stand the formost in the moral Train.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>Who lend Reflexion all the Grace of Art,</L>
<L>And strike the Precept home upon the Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET, hapless Artist, tho' thy Skill can raise</L>
<L>The bursting Peal of universal Praise,</L>
<L>Tho' at thy Beck, Applause delighted stands,</L>
<L>And lifts <HI>Briareus</HI>' like her hundred Hands.</L>
<L>Know Fame awards Thee but a partial Breath,</L>
<L>Not all thy Talents brave the Stroke of Death.</L>
<L>Poets to Ages yet unborn appeal,</L>
<L>And latest Times th' eternal Nature feel.</L>
<L>Tho' blended here the Praise of Bard and Play'r,</L>
<L>While more than Half becomes the Actor's Share,</L>
<L>Relentless Death untwists the mingled Fame,</L>
<L>And sinks the Player in the Poet's Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
<L>THE pliant Muscles of the various Face,</L>
<L>The Mein that gave each Sentence Strength and Grace,</L>
<L>The tuneful Voice, the Eye that spoke the Mind,</L>
<L>Are gone, nor leave a single Trace behind.</L>
