<P>ROSINA, A COMIC OPERA, IN TWO ACTS. PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception this little Piece has met with from the Public, demands my warmest acknowledgments: nor can I say too much of the support it has received, both from the music, admirably adapted to the words, and the spirited and judicious performance of the seve∣ral characters, which surpassed my most sanguine wishes.</P>
<P>The decorations, designed and executed in that style of elegant and characteristic simplicity which the subject requir'd, add greatly to the effect of the whole.</P>
<P>The fable of this piece, taken from the book of Ruth; a fable equally simple, moral, and interest∣ing, has already furnished a subject for the beauti∣ful Episode of Palemon and Lavinia in Thomson's Seasons, and a pleasing Opera of Mons. Favart: of both I have availed myself as far as the differ∣ence of my plan would allow; but as we are not, however extraordinary it may appear, so easily sa∣tisfied with mere sentiment as our more sprightly neighbours the French, I found it necessary to di∣versify the story by adding the comic characters of William and Phoebe, which I hop'd might at once relieve, and heighten the sentimental cast of the other personages of the drama.</P>
<P>Some of the songs, and a few short passages of the dialogue, (printed with inverted commas) though judiciously omitted in the representation from the apprehension of making the Opera too long, are here restor'd, as tending to mark the cha∣racters with more precision.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE opens and discovers a rural prospect: on the left side a little hill with trees at the top; a spring of water rushes from the side, and falls into a natural bason below: on the right side a cottage, at the door of which is a bench of stone. At a distance a chain of mountains. The manor-house in view. A field of corn fills up the scene.</STAGE>
<STAGE>In the first act the sky clears by degrees, the morning va∣pour disperses, the sun rises, and at the end of the act is above the horizon: at the beginning of the second he is past the height, and declines till the end of the day. This progressive motion should be made imper∣ceptibly, but its effect should be visible through the two acts.</STAGE>

<STAGE>The day begins to break; a few stars still appear; after the Trio, the sun is seen to rise. The door of the cot∣tage is open, a lamp burning just within. <HI>Dorcas,</HI> seated on the bench, is spinning; <HI>Rosina</HI> and <HI>Phoebe,</HI> just within the door, are measuring a bushel of corn; <HI>William</HI> comes from the top of the stage; they sing the following Trio.</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorc.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, your honor, since the dear child gives me leave to speak, she's of as good a family as any in England. Her mother, sweet lady, was my bountiful old master's daughter, Squire Welford of Lincolnshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What happiness! But go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorc.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was a noble gentleman, and nobody's enemy but his own. His estate was seiz'd for a mort∣gage of not half its value, just after young madam was married, and she ne'er got a penny of her portion. They say, if Rosina had a friend, she might get the estate again by paying the mortgage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her father?</P>
</SP>

<P>Was a brave gentleman too, a colonel: A charming couple they were, and lov'd one another so, it would have done your heart good to see them. His honor went to the Eastern Indies, to better his fortune, and Madam would go wi' him. The ship was lost, and they with all the little means they had, went to the bottom. Young Madam Rosina was their only child; they left her at school; but when this sad news came, the mistress did not care for keeping her, so the dear child has shar'd my poor morsel.</P>

<P>Faith, good woman, you owe nothing at all. I'll tell your honor how it was. My comrades and I were crossing the meadow, going home, when we saw them first; and hearing a woman, cry, I look'd up, and saw them putting her into a skiff against her will. Says I, Paddy, is not that the clever little <HI>crater</HI> that was <HI>glaning</HI> in the field with us this morning? "'Tis so, sure enough," says he. "By St. Patrick," says I, "there's enough of us to <HI>rescute</HI> her." With that we ran for the bare life, waded up to the knees, laid about us bravely with our shillelays, knock'd them out of the skiff, and brought her back safe: and here she comes, my jewel.</P>
