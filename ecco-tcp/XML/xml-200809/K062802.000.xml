<HEAD>THE MAGDALENS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LO! kneeling at yon Rail with pensive Air,</L>
<L>A num'rous Train of suppliant Nymphs I spy:</L>
<L>Their youthful Cheek is pal'd with early Care,</L>
<L>And Sorrow dwells in their dejected Eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark, They attune a solemn plaintive Lay,</L>
<L>Where Grief with Harmony delights to meet:</L>
<L>Not <HI>Philomela</HI> from her lonely Spray</L>
<L>Trills her clear Note, more querulously sweet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>Are These the Fair who wont with conscious Grace</L>
<L>Proud <HI>Ranelagh's</HI> resplendent Round to tread?</L>
<L>Shine in the studied Luxury of Dress?</L>
<L>And vie in Beauty with the high-born Maid?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The smiling Scenes of Pleasure they sorsake,</L>
<L>Obey no more Amusement's idle Call,</L>
<L>Nor mingling with the Sons of Mirth partake</L>
<L>The Treat voluptuous, or the festive Ball.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For sober Weeds they change their bright Attire,</L>
<L>Of the Pearl Bracelet strip the graceful Arm,</L>
<L>Veil the white Breast, that lately heav'd Desire,</L>
<L>And thrill'd with tender exquisite Alarm:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unbraid the cunning Tresses of the Hair,</L>
<L>And each well-fancied Ornament remove,</L>
<L>The glowing Gem, the glitt'ring Solitaireâ€”</L>
<L>The costly spoils of prostituted Love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<L>Yet Beauty lingers on their mournful Brow,</L>
<L>Unwilling to forsake the Tear-dew'd Cheek,</L>
<L>Which scarcely blushing with a languid Glow</L>
<L>Partakes a Softness delicately meek.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more compare then to the stately Flow'r,</L>
<L>Whose painted Foliage wantons in the Gale:</L>
<L>They look the Lily drooping from the Show'r,</L>
<L>Or the pale Vi'let sick'ning in the Vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not the Prude with acrimonious Taunt,</L>
<L>Upbraid the humble Tenants of this Dome,</L>
<L>That Pleasure's rosy Bow'r they us'd to haunt,</L>
<L>And in the Walks of loose-rob'd Dalliance roam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If fond of Empire, and of Conquest vain,</L>
<L>They frequent Vot'ries to their Altars drew,</L>
<L>Yet blaz'd those Altars to the Fair ones' Bane,</L>
<L>The Idol They, and They the Victim too!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>Some in this sacred Mansion may reside,</L>
<L>Who lost their Parents in their Infant Years,</L>
<L>And hapless Orphans! trod without a Guide</L>
<L>The Maze of Life perplext with guileful Snares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some, that encircled by the Great and Rich,</L>
<L>Were won by Wiles, and deep-designing Art,</L>
<L>By splendid Bribes, and sost persuasive Speech,</L>
<L>Of Pow'r to cheat the young unguarded Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some, on whom Beauty breath'd her choicest Bloom,</L>
<L>Whilst adverse Stars all other Gifts remov'd,</L>
<L>Who fled from Mis'ry and a Dungeon's Gloom,</L>
<L>To Scenes their inborn Virtue disapprov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' Their Youth imbib'd an early Stain:</L>
<L>Now gilded by the Rays of new-born Fame,</L>
<L>A second Innocence they here obtain,</L>
<L>And Nun-clad Penance heals their wounded Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<L>So the young Myrtles nipt by treach'rous Cold,</L>
<L>(While still the Summer yields his golden Store,)</L>
<L>In shelt'ring Walls their tender Leaves unfold,</L>
<L>And breathe a sweeter Fragrance than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' white-wing'd Peace protect this calm Abode,</L>
<L>Tho' each tumultuous Passion be suppress'd,</L>
<L>Still Recollection wears a Sting to goad,</L>
<L>Still arrowy Remorse afflicts their Breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tort'ring Hour of Mem'ry this may prove,</L>
<L>Who wrapt in pensive Secrecy forlorn,</L>
<L>Sits musing on the Pledges of her Love,</L>
<L>Expos'd to chilly Want, and grinning Scorn:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Left by their Father in the Time of Need,</L>
<L>Just in th' unfolding Blossom of their Age!</L>
<L>"Was this, Seducer, this the promis'd Meed?"</L>
<L>She cries: Then sinks beneath Affliction's Rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<L>Another mourns her Fall with Grief sincere,</L>
<L>Whom tranquil Reason tells she's shun'd, disdain'd,</L>
<L>Repuls'd as vile by those who held her dear,</L>
<L>Who call'd her once Companion, Sister, Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That recollects the Day, when lost to Shame</L>
<L>She fondly sacrific'd her vestal Charms:</L>
<L>Resign'd the Virgin's for an Harlot's Name,</L>
<L>And left a Parent's for a Spoiler's Arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imagination pencils to her Mind</L>
<L>The Father's Rage, the Mother's softer Woe:</L>
<L>Unhappy Pair! to that Distress consign'd</L>
<L>A Child can give, a Parent only know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dreadful Picture fixes Sorrow's Dart,</L>
<L>Fond filial Passions in her Breast revive:</L>
<L>She feels keen Anguish preying at her Heart,</L>
<L>To Nature's Pangs too sensibly alive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<L>If this, or similar tormenting Thought,</L>
<L>Cling to their Soul, when pensively alone,</L>
<L>For Youth's Offence, for Love's alluring Fault,</L>
<L>Say, do they not sufficiently atone?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O mock not then their penitential Woes,</L>
<L>Thou, who may'st deign to mark this humble Theme,</L>
<L>Nor seek with foul Derision to expose</L>
<L>And give to Infamy their tainted Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor deem me one of Melancholy's Train,</L>
<L>If anxious for the Sorrow-wedded Fair,</L>
<L>(Tho' little skilful of poetic Strain</L>
<L>Whose pleasing Music takes the tuneful Ear)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I steal impatient from the idle Throng,</L>
<L>The roving, gay, Companions of my Age,</L>
<L>To temper with their Praise my artless Song,</L>
<L>And soft-ey'd Pity in their Cause engage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
<L>'Tis Virtue's Task to soothe Affliction's Smart,</L>
<L>To join in Sadness with the Fair distrest:</L>
<L>Wake to another's Pain the tender Heart,</L>
<L>And move to Sympathy the feeling Breast.</L>
