<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Death of <HI>Hector.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Trojans</HI> being safe within the Walls, <HI>Hector</HI> only stays to oppose <HI>Achilles. Priam</HI> is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his Son to re-enter the Town. <HI>Hecuba</HI> joins her Entreaties, but in vain. <HI>Hector</HI> consults within himself what Measures to take; but at the ad∣vance of <HI>Achilles,</HI> his Resolution fails him, and he flies; <HI>A∣chilles</HI> pursues him thrice round the Walls of <HI>Troy.</HI> The Gods debate concerning the Fate of <HI>Hector,</HI> at length <HI>Minerva</HI> descends to the aid of <HI>Achilles.</HI> She deludes <HI>Hector</HI> in the Shape of <HI>Deiphobus,</HI> he stands the Combate, and is slain. <HI>Achilles</HI> drags the dead Body at his Chariot, in the sight of <HI>Priam</HI> and <HI>Hecuba.</HI> Their Lamentations, Tears, and Despair. Their Cries reach the Ears of <HI>Andromache,</HI> who, ignorant of this, was retired into the inner part of the Palace: She mounts up to the Walls, and beholds her dead Husband. She swoons at the Spectacle. Her Excess of Grief, and Lamen∣tation.</P>
<P>The thirtieth Day still continues. The Scene lies under the Walls, and on the Battlements of <HI>Troy.</HI></P>

Him, as he blazing shot across the Field,</L>

<L>Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;</L>
<L><HI>Hector!</HI> my lov'd, my dearest, bravest Son!</L>

Thee, Vultures wild should scatter round the Shore</L>
<L>And bloody Dogs grow fiercer from thy Gore.</L>
<L>How many valiant Sons I late enjoy'd,</L>
<L N="60">Valiant in vain! by thy curst Arm destroy'd:</L>
<L>Or, worse than slaughter'd, sold in distant Isles</L>
<L>To shameful Bondage and unworthy Toils.</L>
<L>Two, while I speak, my Eyes in vain explore,</L>
<L>Two from one Mother sprung, my <HI>Polydore,</HI></L>

<L N="85">The bitter Dregs of Fortune's Cup to drain:</L>
<L>To fill with Scenes of Death his closing Eyes,</L>

<L>My Heroes slain, my Bridal Bed o'erturn'd,</L>

<L>Yet for my Sons I thank ye Gods! 'twas well:</L>

 Who dies in Youth, and Vigor, dies the best,</L>
<L>Struck thro' with Wounds, all honest on the Breast.</L>
<L>But when the Fates, in Fulness of their Rage,</L>
<L>Spurn the hoar Head of unresisting Age,</L>
<L>In Dust the rev'rend Lineaments deform,</L>
<L N="105">And pour to Dogs the Life-blood scarcely warm;</L>
<L>This, this is Misery! the last, the worst,</L>
<L>That Man can feel; Man, fated to be curst!</L>

<LG>
<L>He said, and acting what no Words could say,</L>
<L>Rent from his Head the silver Locks away.</L>
<L N="110">With him the mournful Mother bears a Part;</L>
<L>Yet all their Sorrows turn not <HI>Hector</HI>'s Heart:</L>
<L>The Zone unbrac'd, her Bosom she display'd;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Have mercy on me, O my Son! Revere</L>

<L>If ever thee in these fond Arms I prest,</L>

<L>So they, while down their Cheeks the Torrents roll;</L>
<L>But fix'd remains the Purpose of his Soul:</L>
<L>Resolv'd he stands, and with a fiery Glance</L>
<L>Expects the Hero's terrible Advance.</L>
<L N="130">So roll'd up in his Den, the swelling Snake</L>
<L>Beholds the Traveller approach the Brake;</L>
<L>When fed with noxious Herbs his turgid Veins</L>
<L>Have gather'd half the Poisons of the Plains;</L>
<L>He burns, he stiffens with collected Ire,</L>
<L N="135">And his red Eye-balls glare with living Fire.</L>
<L>Beneath a Turret, on his Shield reclin'd,</L>
<L>He stood, and question'd thus his mighty Mind.</L>

<L>Where lyes my Way? To enter in the Wall?</L>
<L>Honour and Shame th' ungen'rous Thought recall:</L>

<L>What Numbers had been sav'd by <HI>Hector</HI>'s Flight?</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
That wise Advice rejected with Disdain,</L>
<L N="145">I feel my Folly in my People slain.</L>
<L>Methinks my suff'ring Country's Voice I hear,</L>

<L>On my rash Courage charge the Chance of War,</L>
<L>And blame those Virtues which they cannot share.</L>
<L N="150">No—If I e'er return, return I must</L>
<L>Glorious, my Country's Terror laid in Dust:</L>
<L>Or if I perish, let her see me fall</L>
<L>In Field at least, and fighting for her Wall.</L>
<L>And yet suppose these Measures I forego,</L>
<L N="155">Approach unarm'd, and parly with the Foe,</L>
<L>The Warrior-Shield, the Helm, and Lance lay down,</L>
<L>And treat on Terms of Peace to save the Town:</L>

<L N="160">With honourable Justice to restore;</L>
<L>And add half <HI>Ilion</HI>'s yet remaining Store,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Troy</HI> shall, sworn, produce; that injur'd <HI>Greece</HI></L>
<L>May share our Wealth, and leave our Walls in Peace.</L>
<L>But why this Thought? Unarm'd if I should go,</L>
<L N="165">What hope of Mercy from this vengeful Foe?</L>
<L>But Woman-like to fall, and fall without a Blow.</L>

We greet not here, as Man conversing Man</L>
<L>Met at an Oak, or journeying o'er a Plain;</L>
<L>No Season now for calm familiar Talk,</L>
<L N="170">Like Youths and Maidens in an Evening Walk:</L>
<L>War is our Business; but to whom is giv'n</L>
<L>To die or triumph, that, determine Heav'n!</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus pond'ring, like a God the <HI>Greek</HI> drew nigh;</L>
<L>His dreadful Plumage nodded from on high;</L>
<L N="175">The <HI>Pelian</HI> Jav'lin, in his better Hand,</L>

<L N="185">Just when he holds or thinks he holds his Prey,</L>

<L>Now where the Fig-trees spread their Umbrage broad,</L>
<L>(A wider Compass) smoak along the Road.</L>
<L N="195">Next by <HI>Scamander</HI>'s double Source they bound,</L>
<L>Where two fam'd Fountains burst the parted Ground;</L>
<L>This hot thro' scorching Clefts is seen to rise,</L>
<L>With Exhalations steaming to the Skies;</L>
<L>That the green Banks in Summer's Heat o'erflows,</L>
<L N="200">Like Crystal clear, and cold as Winter-Snows.</L>
<L>Each gushing Fount a marble Cistern fills,</L>
<L>Whose polish'd Bed receives the falling Rills;</L>
<L>Where <HI>Trojan</HI> Dames, (e'er yet alarm'd by <HI>Greece,</HI>)</L>
<L>Wash'd their fair Garments in the Days of Peace.</L>
<L N="205">By these they past, one chasing, one in Flight,</L>

<L>Swift was the Course; No vulgar Prize they play,</L>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 140. <HI>The Soliloquy of</HI> Hector.]</Q> There is much Greatness in the Sentiments of this whole Soliloquy. <HI>Hector</HI> prefers Death to an ignominious Life: He knows how to die with Glory, but not how to live with Dishonour. The Reproach of <HI>Polydamas</HI> affects him; the Scandals of the meanest People have an Influence on his Thoughts.</P>

bear that any one should be so bold as to excel, and are ready to pull him down to them, upon the least Miscarriage. This Sentiment is perfectly fine, and agreeable to the way of thinking natural to a great and sensible Mind.</P>
<P>There is a very beautiful Break in the middle of this Speech. <HI>Hector</HI>'s Mind fluctuates every way, he is calling a Council in his own Breast, and consulting what Method to pursue: He doubts if he should not propose Terms of Peace to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and grants him very large Concessions; but of a sudden he checks himself, and leaves the Sentence unfinish'd.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 180. <HI>Struck by some God, he fears, recedes, and flies.</HI>]</Q> I doubt not most Readers are shock'd at the Flight of <HI>Hector:</HI> It is indeed a high Exaltation of <HI>Achilles</HI> (which was the Poets chief Care, as he was his chief Hero) that so brave a Man as <HI>He∣ctor</HI> durst not stand him. While <HI>Achilles</HI> was at a distance he had fortify'd his Heart with noble Resolutions, but at his approach they all vanish, and he flies. This (as exceptionable as some may think it) may yet be allow'd to be a true Portrait of human Nature; for Distance, as it lessens all Objects, so it does our Fears: But where inevitable Danger approaches, the stoutest Hearts will feel some Apprehensions at certain Fate. It was the Saying of one of the bravest Men in this Age, to one who told him he fear'd nothing, <HI>Shew me but a certain Danger, and I shall be as much afraid as any of you.</HI> I don't absolute∣ly pretend to justify this Passage in every point, but only to have thus much granted me, that <HI>Hector</HI> was in this despe∣rate Circumstance.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It will not be found in the whole Iliad, that <HI>Hector</HI> ever thought himself a Match for <HI>Achilles. Homer</HI> (to keep this in our Minds) had just now made <HI>Priam</HI> tell him (as a thing known, for certainly <HI>Priam</HI> would not insult him at that time) that there was no Comparison between his own Strength, and that of his Antagonist.<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> we may observe with <HI>Dacier,</HI> the Degrees by which <HI>Homer</HI> prepares this Incident. In the 18th Book the mere Sight and Voice of <HI>Achilles,</HI> unarm'd, has terrify'd and put the whole <HI>Trojan</HI> Army into Disorder. In the 19th, the very Sound of the coelestial Arms given him by <HI>Vulcan,</HI> has affrighted his own <HI>Myrmidons</HI> as they stand about him. In the 20th, he has been upon the point of killing <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and <HI>Hector</HI> himself was not sav'd from him but by <HI>Apollo</HI>'s in∣terposing. In that and the following Book, he makes an incredible Slaughter of all that oppose him; he overtakes
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
most of those that fly from him, and <HI>Priam</HI> himself opens the Gates of <HI>Troy</HI> to receive the rest.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Hector</HI> stays, not that he hopes to overcome <HI>A∣chilles,</HI> but because Shame and the dread of Reproach forbid him to re-enter the City; a Shame (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) which was a Fault, that betray'd him out of his Life, and ruin'd his Countrey. Nay, <HI>Homer</HI> adds farther, that he only stay'd by the immediate <HI>Will of Heaven,</HI> intoxicated and irresistibly bound down by <HI>Fate.</HI><Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> He had just been reflecting on the Injustice of the War he maintain'd; his Spirits are deprest by Heaven, he expects certain Death, he perceives himself abandon'd by the Gods; (as he directly says in ℣. 300, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Greek,</HI> and 385 of the translation) so that he might say to <HI>Achilles</HI> what <HI>Turnus</HI> does to <HI>Aeneas,</HI><Q><L><HI>Dii</HI> me terrent, &amp; <HI>Jupiter</HI> hostis.</L></Q> This indeed is the strongest Reason that can be offer'd for the Flight of <HI>Hector.</HI> He flies not from <HI>Achilles</HI> as a mor∣tal Hero, but from one whom he sees clad in impenetrable Armour, seconded by <HI>Minerva,</HI> and one who had put to flight the inferior Gods themselves. This is not Cowardice according to the constant Principles of <HI>Homer,</HI> who thought it no part of a Hero's Character to be impious, or to fancy himself independent on the supreme Being.</P>
<P>Indeed it had been a grievous Fault, had our Author suf∣fer'd the Courage of <HI>Hector</HI> entirely to forsake him even in this Extremity: A brave Man's Soul is still capable of rouzing itself, and acting honourably in the last Struggles. Accord∣ingly <HI>Hector,</HI> tho' deliver'd over to his Destiny, abandon'd by the Gods, and certain of Death, yet stops and attacks <HI>Achil∣les;</HI> When he loses his Spear, he draws his Sword: it was impossible he should conquer, it was only in his Power to fall gloriously; this he did, and it was all that Man could do.</P>
<P>If the Reader, after all, cannot bring himself to like this Passage, for his own particular; yet to induce him to suspend
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>
his absolute Censure, he may consider that <HI>Virgil</HI> had an uncommon Esteem for it, as he has testify'd in transferring it almost entirely to the Death of <HI>Turnus;</HI> where there was no necessity of making use of the like Incidents: But doubt∣less he was touch'd with this Episode, as with one of those which interest us most of the whole Iliad, by a Spe∣ctacle at once so terrible, and so deplorable. I must also add the Suffrage of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who was so far from looking upon this Passage as ridiculous or blameable, that he esteem'd it mar∣vellous and admirable. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>wonderful,</HI> says he, ought to have place in Tragedy, but still more in Epic Poetry, which proceeds in this Point even to the Unrea∣sonable: For as in Epic Poems one sees not the Per∣sons acting, so whatever passes the Bounds of Reason is proper to produce the admirable and the marvellous. For example, what <HI>Homer</HI> says of <HI>Hector</HI> pursued by <HI>Achilles,</HI> would appear ridiculous on the Stage; for the Spectators could not forbear laughing to see on one side the <HI>Greeks</HI> standing without any motion, and on the other; <HI>A∣chilles</HI> pursuing <HI>Hector,</HI> and making Signs to the Troops not to dart at him. But all this does not appear when we read the Poem: For what is wonderful is always agreeable, and as a proof of it, we find that they who relate any thing usually add something to the Truth, that it may the bet∣ter please those who hear it.</Q></P>
<P>The same great Critick vindicates this Passage in the Chapter following. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Poet, says he, is inexcusable if he in∣troduces such things as are impossible according to the Rules of Poetry: but this ceases to be a Fault, if by those means he attains to the End he propos'd; for he has then brought about what he intended: For example, if he ren∣ders by it any part of his Poem more astonishing or admi∣rable.

I think both their Characters are admirably sustain'd, and tho' <HI>Achil∣les</HI> be drawn with a great Violence of Features, yet the Picture is undoubtedly like him; and it had been the utmost Absur∣dity to have soften'd one Line upon this Occasion, when the Soul of <HI>Achilles</HI> was all on fire to revenge the Death of his Friend <HI>Patroclus.</HI> I must desire the Reader to carry this Observation in his Memory, and particularly in that place, where <HI>Achilles</HI> says he could eat the very Flesh of <HI>Hector;</HI> (tho' I have a little soften'd it in the Translation) V. 438.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 474. <HI>The Speech of</HI> Achilles.]</Q> We have a very fine Observation of <HI>Eustathius</HI> on this Place, that the Judgment and Address of <HI>Homer</HI> here is extreamly worthy of Remark: He knew, and had often said, that the Gods and Fate had not granted <HI>Achilles</HI> the Glory of taking <HI>Troy:</HI> There was then no rea∣son to make him march against the Town after the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> since all his Efforts must have been ineffectual.

The Manners of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and what he has already done for <HI>Patroclus,</HI> make this very natural. At the same time, this turning off to the tender and pathetick has a fine Effect; the Reader in the very Fury of the Hero's Vengeance, perceives, that <HI>Achilles</HI> is still a Man, and capable of softer Passions.</P>

But what is extremely remarkable, and evidently shews the Injustice of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Cen∣sure is, that many of those very Actions for which he blames him are expressly characterized and marked by <HI>Homer</HI> himself as evil and detestable, by previous Expressions or Cautions.

I will venture to say, there are not in all <HI>Homer</HI> any Lines more worthy of him: The Beauty of this tender and Compassionate Image is such, that it even makes amends for the many cruel ones, with which the Iliad is too much stained.

<L N="440">Thick, where they drive, the dusty Clouds arise,</L>
<L>And the lost Courser in the Whirlwind flies;</L>
<L>Loose on their Shoulders the long Manes reclin'd,</L>
<L>Float in their Speed, and dance upon the Wind:</L>
<L>The smoaking Chariots, rapid as they bound,</L>
<L N="445">Now seem to touch the Sky, and now the Ground.</L>
<L>While hot for Fame, and Conquest all their Care,</L>
<L>(Each o'er his flying Courser hung in Air)</L>
<L>Erect with Ardour, pois'd upon the Rein,</L>
<L>They pant, they stretch, they shout along the Plain.</L>
<L N="450"><PB N="82" REF="82"/>
 Now, (the last Compass fetch'd around the Goal)</L>
<L>At the near Prize each gathers all his Soul,</L>
<L>Each burns with double Hope, with double Pain,</L>
<L>Tears up the Shore, and thunders tow'rd the Main.</L>
<L>First flew <HI>Eumelus</HI> on <HI>Pheretian</HI> Steeds;</L>
<L N="455">With those of <HI>Tros,</HI> bold <HI>Diomed</HI> succeeds:</L>
<L>Close on <HI>Eumelus'</HI> Back they puff the Wind,</L>
<L>And seem just mounting on his Car behind;</L>
<L>Full on his Neck he feels the sultry Breeze,</L>
<L>And hov'ring o'er, their stretching Shadows sees.</L>
<L N="460">Then had he lost, or left a doubtful Prize;</L>
<L>But angry <HI>Phoebus</HI> to <HI>Tydides</HI> flies,</L>
<L>Strikes from his Hand the Scourge, and renders vain</L>
<L>His matchless Horses labour on the Plain.</L>
<L>Rage fills his Eye with Anguish, to survey</L>
<L N="465">Snatch'd from his Hope, the Glories of the Day.</L>
<L>The Fraud celestial <HI>Pallas</HI> sees with Pain,</L>
<L>Springs to her Knight, and gives the Scourge again,</L>
<L>And fills his Steeds with Vigour. At a Stroke,</L>
<L>She breaks his Rivals Chariot from the Yoke;</L>
<L N="470">No more their Way the startled Horses held;</L>
<L>The Car revers'd came rat'ling on the Field;</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="83"/>
Shot headlong from his Seat, beside the Wheel,</L>
<L>Prone on the Dust th' unhappy Master fell;</L>
<L>His batter'd Face and Elbows strike the Ground;</L>
<L N="475">Nose, Mouth and Front, one undistinguish'd Wound:</L>
<L>Grief stops his Voice, a Torrent drowns his Eyes;</L>
<L>Before him far the glad <HI>Tydides</HI> flies;</L>
<L><HI>Minerva</HI>'s Spirit drives his matchless Pace,</L>
<L>And crowns him Victor of the labour'd Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="480">The next, tho' distant, <HI>Menelas</HI> succeeds;</L>
<L>While thus young <HI>Nestor</HI> animates his Steeds.</L>
<L>Now, now, my gen'rous Pair, exert your Force;</L>
<L>Not that we hope to match <HI>Tydides'</HI> Horse,</L>
<L>Since great <HI>Minerva</HI> wings their rapid Way,</L>
<L N="485">And gives their Lord the Honours of the Day.</L>
<L>But reach <HI>Atrides!</HI> Shall his Mare out-go</L>
<L>Your Swiftness? Vanquish'd by a female Foe?</L>
<L>Thro' your neglect if lagging on the Plain</L>
<L>The last ignoble Gift be all we gain;</L>
<L N="490">No more shall <HI>Nestor</HI>'s Hand your Food supply,</L>
<L>The old Man's Fury rises, and ye die.</L>
<L>Haste then; yon' narrow Road before our Sight</L>
<L>Presents th' occasion, could we use it right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
<L>Thus He. The Coursers at their Master's Threat</L>
<L N="495">With quicker Steps the sounding Champain beat.</L>
<L>And now <HI>Antilochus,</HI> with nice survey,</L>
<L>Observes the Compass of the hollow way.</L>
<L>'Twas where by Force of wintry Torrents torn,</L>
<L>Fast by the Road a Precipice was worn:</L>
<L N="500">Here, where but one could pass, to shun the Throng</L>
<L>The <HI>Spartan</HI> Hero's Chariot smoak'd along.</L>
<L>Close up the vent'rous Youth resolves to keep,</L>
<L>Still edging near, and bears him tow'rd the Steep.</L>
<L><HI>Atrides,</HI> trembling casts his Eye below,</L>
<L N="505">And wonders at the Rashness of his Foe.</L>
<L>Hold, stay your Steeds—What Madness thus to ride?</L>
<L>This narrow way? Take larger Field (he cry'd)</L>
<L>Or both mull fall<HI>—Atrides</HI> cry'd in vain;</L>
<L>He flies more fast, and throws up all the Rein.</L>
<L N="510">Far as an able Arm the Disk can send,</L>
<L>When youthful Rivals their full Force extend,</L>
<L>So far <HI>Antilochus!</HI> thy Chariot flew</L>
<L>Before the King: He, cautious, backward drew</L>
<L>His Horse compell'd; foreboding in his Fears</L>
<L N="515">The rattling Ruin of the clashing Cars,</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="85"/>
The flound'ring Coursers rolling on the Plain,</L>
<L>And Conquest lost thro' frantick Haste to gain.</L>
<L>But thus upbraids his Rival as he flies;</L>
<L>Go, furious Youth! ungen'rous and unwise!</L>
<L N="520">Go, but expect not I'll the Prize resign;</L>
<L>Add Perjury to Fraud, and make it thine.—</L>
<L>Then to his Steeds with all his Force he cries;</L>
<L>Be swift, be vig'rous, and regain the Prize!</L>
<L>Your Rivals, destitute of youthful Force,</L>
<L N="525">With fainting Knees shall labour in the Course,</L>
<L>And yield the Glory yours—The Steeds obey;</L>
<L>Already at their Heels they wing their Way,</L>
<L>And seem already to retrieve the Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meantime the <HI>Grecians</HI> in a Ring beheld</L>
<L N="530">The Coursers bounding o'er the dusty Field.</L>
<L>The first who markd them was the <HI>Cretan</HI> King;</L>
<L>High on a rising Ground, above the Ring,</L>
<L>The Monarch sate; from whence with sure survey</L>
<L>He well observ'd the Chief who led the way,</L>
<L N="535">And heard from far his animating Cries,</L>
<L>And saw the foremost Steed with sharpen'd Eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="86"/>
On whose broad Front a Blaze of shining white,</L>
<L>Like the full Moon, stood obvious to the Sight.</L>
<L>He saw; and rising, to the <HI>Greeks</HI> begun.</L>
<L N="540">Are yonder Horse discern'd by me alone?</L>
<L>Or can ye, all, another Chief survey,</L>
<L>And other Steeds, than lately led the Way?</L>
<L>Those, tho' the swiftest, by some God with-held,</L>
<L>Lie sure disabled in the middle Field:</L>
<L N="545">For since the Goal they doubled, round the Plain</L>
<L>I search to find them, but I search in vain.</L>
<L>Perchance the Reins forsook the Driver's Hand,</L>
<L>And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the Strand,</L>
<L>Shot from the Chariot; while his Coursers stray</L>
<L N="550">With frantick Fury from the destin'd Way.</L>
<L>Rise then some other, and inform my Sight,</L>
<L>(For these dim Eyes, perhaps, discern not right)</L>
<L>Yet sure he seems, (to judge by Shape and Air,)</L>
<L>The great <HI>Aetolian</HI> Chief, renown'd in War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="555">Old Man! (<HI>Oïleus</HI> rashly thus replies)</L>
<L>Thy Tongue too hastily confers the Prize.</L>
<L>Of those who view the Course, not sharpest ey'd,</L>
<L>Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="87"/>
<HI>Eumelus'</HI> Steeds high-bounding in the Chace,</L>
<L N="560">Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the Race,</L>
<L>I well discern him, as he shakes the Rein,</L>
<L>And hear his Shouts victorious o'er the Plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he. <HI>Idomeneus</HI> incens'd rejoin'd:</L>
<L>Barb'rous of Words! and arrogant of Mind!</L>
<L N="565">Contentious Prince! of all the <HI>Greeks</HI> beside</L>
<L>The last in Merit, as the first in Pride.</L>
<L>To vile Reproach what Answer can we make?</L>
<L>A Goblet or a Tripod let us stake,</L>
<L>And be the King the Judge. The most unwise</L>
<L N="570">Will learn their Rashness, when they pay the Price.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said: and <HI>Ajax</HI> by mad Passion born,</L>
<L>Stern had reply'd; fierce Scorn inhancing Scorn</L>
<L>To fell extreams. But <HI>Thetis'</HI> god-like Son,</L>
<L>Awful, amidst them rose; and thus begun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="575">Forbear ye Chiefs! reproachful to contend;</L>
<L>Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:</L>
<L>And lo! th'approaching Steeds your Contest end.</L>
<L>No sooner had he spoke, but thund'ring near</L>
<L>Drives, thro' a Stream of Dust, the Charioteer;</L>
<L N="580"><PB N="88" REF="88"/>
 High o'er his Head the circling Lash he wields;</L>
<L>His bounding Horses scarcely touch the Fields:</L>
<L>His Car amidst the dusty Whirlwind roll'd,</L>
<L>Bright with the mingled Blaze of Tin and Gold,</L>
<L>Refulgent thro' the Cloud, no Eye could find</L>
<L N="585">The Track his flying Wheels had left behind:</L>
<L>And the fierce Coursers urg'd their rapid Pace</L>
<L>So swift, it seem'd a Flight, and not a Race.</L>
<L>Now Victor at the Goal <HI>Tydides</HI> stands,</L>
<L>Quits his bright Car, and springs upon the Sands;</L>
<L N="590">From the hot Steeds the sweaty Torrents stream;</L>
<L>The well-ply'd Whip is hung athwart the Beam;</L>
<L>With Joy brave <HI>Sthenelus</HI> receives the Prize,</L>
<L>The Tripod-Vase, and Dame with radiant Eyes:</L>
<L>These to the Ships his Train triumphant leads,</L>
<L N="595">The Chief himself unyokes the panting Steeds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young <HI>Nestor</HI> follows (who by Art, not Force,</L>

<L>Behind, <HI>Atrides</HI> urg'd the Race, or more near</L>
<L>Than to the Courser in his swift Career</L>
<L N="600">The following Car, just touching with his Heel</L>
<L>And brushing with his Tail the whirling Wheel.</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="89"/>
Such, and so narrow now the Space between</L>
<L>The Rivals, late so distant on the Green.</L>
<L>So soon swift <HI>Aethe</HI> her lost Ground regain'd,</L>
<L N="605">One Length, one Moment had the Race obtain'd.</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>Merion</HI> pursu'd, at greater Distance still,</L>

<L>Last came, <HI>Admetus!</HI> thy unhappy Son;</L>
<L>Slow dragg'd the Steeds his batter'd Chariot on:</L>
<L N="610"><HI>Achilles</HI> saw, and pitying thus begun.</L>

<LG>
<L>Behold! the Man whose matchless Art surpast</L>
<L>The Sons of <HI>Greece!</HI> the ablest, yet the last!</L>
<L>Fortune denies, but Justice bids us pay</L>
<L>(Since great <HI>Tydides</HI> bears the first away)</L>
<L N="615">To him the second Honours of the Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Greeks</HI> consent with loud applauding Cries,</L>
<L>And then <HI>Eumelus</HI> had receiv'd the Prize,</L>
<L>But youthful <HI>Nestor,</HI> jealous of his Fame,</L>
<L>Th' Award opposes, and asserts his Claim.</L>
<L N="620">Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign</L>
<L>O <HI>Peleus</HI> Son! the Mare so justly mine.</L>
<L>What if the Gods, the Skilful to confound,</L>
<L>Have thrown the Horse and Horseman to the Ground?</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="90"/>
Perhaps he sought not Heav'n by Sacrifice,</L>
<L N="625">And Vows omitted forfeited the Prize.</L>
<L>If yet (Distinction to thy Friend to show,</L>
<L>And please a Soul, desirous to bestow,)</L>
<L>Some Gift must grace <HI>Eumelus;</HI> view thy Store</L>
<L>Of beauteous Handmaids, Steeds, and shining Ore,</L>
<L N="630">An ample Present let him thence receive,</L>
<L>And <HI>Greece</HI> shall praise thy gen'rous Thirst to give.</L>
<L>But this, my Prize, I never shall forego;</L>
<L>This, who but touches, Warriors! is my Foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus spake the Youth, nor did his Words offend;</L>
<L N="635">Pleas'd with the well-turn'd Flattery of a Friend,</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> smil'd: The Gift propos'd (he cry'd)</L>
<L><HI>Antilochus!</HI> we shall our self provide.</L>
<L>With Plates of Brass the Corselet cover'd o'er,</L>
<L>(The same renown'd <HI>Asteropaeus</HI> wore)</L>
<L N="640">Whose glitt'ring Margins rais'd with Silver shine;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said: <HI>Automedon</HI> at his Command</L>
<L>The Corselet brought, and gave it to his Hand.</L>
<L>Distinguish'd by his Friend, his Bosom glows</L>
<L N="645">With gen'rous Joy: Then <HI>Menelaus</HI> rose;</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="91"/>
The Herald plac'd the Sceptre in his Hands,</L>
<L>And still'd the Clamour of the shouting Bands.</L>
<L>Not without Cause incens'd at <HI>Nestor</HI>'s Son,</L>
<L>And inly grieving, thus the King begun:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="650">The Praise of Wisdom, in thy Youth obtain'd,</L>

<L>Robb'd of my Glory and my just Reward,</L>

<L>So not a Leader shall our Conduct blame,</L>
<L N="655">Or judge me envious of a Rival's Fame.</L>
<L>But shall not we, ourselves, the Truth maintain?</L>
<L>What needs appealing in a Fact so plain?</L>
<L>What <HI>Greek</HI> shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,</L>
<L>And vindicate by Oath th'ill-gotten Prize.</L>
<L N="660">Rise if thou dar'st, before thy Chariot stand,</L>
<L>The driving Scourge high-lifted in thy Hand,</L>
<L>And touch thy Steeds, and swear, thy whole Intent</L>
<L>Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.</L>
<L>Swear by that God whose liquid Arms surround</L>
<L>The Globe, and whose dread Earthquakes heave the Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="666">The prudent Chief with calm Attention heard;</L>
<L>Then mildly thus: Excuse, if Youth have err'd;</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="92"/>
Superior as thou art, forgive th'Offence,</L>
<L>Nor I thy Equal, or in Years, or Sense.</L>
<L N="670">Thou know'st the Errors of unripen'd Age,</L>

<L>Joy swells his Soul, as when the vernal Grain</L>

<L>And laugh and glitter with the Morning Dew:</L>
<L>Such Joy the <HI>Spartan</HI>'s shining Face o'erspread,</L>
<L>And lifted his gay Heart, while thus he said.</L>

<LG>
<L>Still may our Souls, O gen'rous Youth! agree,</L>

<L>Rash Heat perhaps a Moment might controul,</L>

For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,</L>

<L>Suffice thy Father's Merits, and thy own:</L>
<L>Gen'rous alike, for me, the Sire and Son</L>

<L>I yield; that all may know, my Soul can bend,</L>
<L>Nor is my Pride preferr'd before my Friend.</L>

<L>With Joy, the venerable King reply'd.</L>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS, and the following Book, which contain the Description of the Funeral of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and other Matters relating to <HI>Hector,</HI> are undoubtedly superadded to the grand Catastrophe of the Poem; for the Story is compleatly finish'd with the Death of that Hero in the 22<SUP>d</SUP> Book. Many judicious Criticks have been of opinion that <HI>Homer</HI> is blameable for protract∣ing it. <HI>Virgil</HI> closes the whole Scene of Action with the Death of <HI>Turnus,</HI> and leaves the rest to be imagin'd by the Mind of the Reader: He does not draw the Picture at full Length, but delineates it so far, that we cannot fail of ima∣gining the whole Draught. There is however one thing to be said in favour of <HI>Homer</HI> which may perhaps justify him in his Method, that what he undertook was to paint the <HI>An∣ger of</HI> Achilles: And as that Anger does not die with <HI>Hector,</HI> but persecutes his very remains, so the Poet still keeps up to his Subject; nay it seems to require that he should carry down the Relation of that Resentment, which is the Foun∣dation of his Poem, till it is fully satisfy'd: And as this sur∣vives <HI>Hector,</HI> and gives the Poet an Opportunity of still shewing many sad Effects of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Anger, the two fol∣lowing Books may be thought not to be Excrescencies, but essential to the Poem.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="113"/>
<HI>Virgil</HI> had been inexcusable had he trod in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Foot∣steps; for it is evident that the Fall of <HI>Turnus,</HI> by giving <HI>Aeneas</HI> a full Power over <HI>Italy,</HI> answers the whole Design and Intention of the Poem; had he gone farther he had o∣vershot his Mark: And tho' <HI>Homer</HI> proceeds after <HI>Hector</HI>'s Death, yet the Subject is still the Anger of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>We are now past the War and Violence of the <HI>Ilias,</HI> the Scenes of Blood are closed during the rest of the Poem; we may look back with a pleasing kind of Horror upon the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and see what dire Effects it has wrought in the compass of nineteen Days: <HI>Troy</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> are both in Mourning for it, Heaven and Earth, Gods and Men, have suffer'd in the Conflict. The Reader seems landed upon the Shore after a violent Storm; and has Leisure to survey the Consequences of the Tempest, and the Wreck oc∣casion'd by the former Commotions, <HI>Troy</HI> weeping for <HI>He∣ctor,</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> for <HI>Patroclus.</HI> Our Passions have been in an Agitation since the opening of the Poem; wherefore the Poet, like some great Master in Musick, softens his Notes, and melts his Readers into Tenderness and Pity.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 18. <L><HI>Tears bathe their Arms, and tears the Sands bedew,—</HI></L>
<L>—Thetis <HI>aids their Woe—</HI>]</L></Q> It is not easy to give a reason why <HI>Thetis</HI> should be said to excite the Grief of the <HI>Myrmidons,</HI> and of <HI>Achilles;</HI> it had seem'd more natural for the Mother to have compos'd the Sor∣rows of the Son, and restored his troubled Mind to Tran∣quillity.</P>
<P>But such a Procedure would have outrag'd the Character of <HI>Achilles,</HI> who is all along describ'd to be of such a Violence of Temper, that he is not easy to be pacify'd at any time, much less upon so great an Incident as the Death of his Friend <HI>Patroclus.</HI> Perhaps the Poet made use of this Ficti∣on in honour of <HI>Achilles;</HI> he makes every Passion of his Hero considerable, his Sorrow as well as Anger is important, and he cannot grieve but a Goddess attends him, and a whole Army weeps.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114"/>
Some Commentators fancy'd that <HI>Homer</HI> animates the very Sands of the Seas, and the Arms of the <HI>Myrmidons,</HI> and makes them sensible of the Loss of <HI>Patroclus;</HI> the preceding Words seem to strengthen that Opinion, be∣cause the Poet introduces a Goddess to raise the Sorrow of the Army. But <HI>Eustathius</HI> seems not to give into this Conjecture, and I think very judiciously; for what Re∣lation is there between the Sands of the Shores, and the Arms of the <HI>Myrmidons?</HI> It would have been more poetical to have said, the Sands and the Rocks, than the Sands and the Arms; but it is very natural to say, that the Soldiers wept so bitterly, that their Armour and the very Sands were wet with their Tears. I believe this Remark will appear very just by read∣ing the Verse, with a Comma after <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, thus,<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q> Then the Construction will be natural and easy, Period will answer Period in the <HI>Greek,</HI> and the Sense in <HI>English</HI> will be, the Sands were wet, and the Arms were wet, with the Tears of the Mourners.</P>
<P>But however this be, there is a very remarkable Beauty in the run of the Verse in <HI>Homer,</HI> every Word has a melan∣choly Cadence, and the Poet has not only made the Sands and the Arms, but even his very Verse, to lament with <HI>A∣chilles.</HI></P>

An ordinary Poet would have contented himself with saying, he laid his Hand upon the Breast of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> but <HI>Homer</HI> knows how to raise the most trivial Circumstance, and by adding this one Word, he laid his <HI>deadly</HI> Hands, or his <HI>murderous</HI> Hands on <HI>Patroclus</HI> Breast, he fills our Minds with great Ideas, and

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 92. <HI>Forbid to pass th'irremeable Flood.</HI>]</Q> It was the common Opinion of the Ancients, that the Souls of the Departed were not admitted into the Number of the Happy till their Bodies had receiv'd the funeral Rites; they suppos'd those that wanted them wander'd an hundred Years before they were wafted over the infernal River: <HI>Virgil</HI> perhaps had this Passage of <HI>Homer</HI> in his view in the sixth <HI>Aeneis,</HI> at least he coincides with his Sentiments concerning the State of the departed Souls.<Q><L>Haec omnis, quam cernis inops inhumata{que} Turba est:</L>
<L>Nec ripas datur horrendas, nec rauca fluenta</L>

<L>When once we pass, the Soul returns no more.</L></Q></P>
<P>For the fuller understanding of <HI>Homer,</HI> it is necessary to be acquainted with his Notion of the State of the Soul after Death: He follow'd the Philosophy of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> who suppos'd Man to be compounded of three Parts, an intel∣ligent Mind, a Vehicle for that Mind, and a Body; the Mind they call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Vehicle <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Image</HI> or <HI>Soul,</HI> and the gross Body <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The Soul, in which the Mind was lodg'd, was suppos'd exactly to resemble the Body in Shape, Magnitude, and Features; for this being in the Body as the Statue in its Mold, so soon as it goes forth is pro∣perly the Image of that Body in which it was enclos'd: This it was that appear'd to <HI>Achilles,</HI> with the full Resemblance of his Friend <HI>Patroclus.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 108. <HI>May mix our Ashes in one common Grave.</HI>]</Q> There is something very pathetical in this whole Speech of <HI>Patroclus;</HI> he begins it with kind Reproaches, and blames <HI>A∣chilles</HI> with a friendly Tenderness; he recounts to him the in∣separable Affection that had been between them in their Lives, and makes it his last Request, that they may not be parted even in Death, but that their Bones may rest in the same Urn. The Speech itself is of a due Length, it ought not to be very short, because this Apparition is an Incident entirely different from any other in the whole Poem, and consequently the Reader would not have been satisfy'd with a cursory men∣tion of it; neither ought it to be long, because this would have been contrary to the Nature of such Apparitions, whose Stay upon Earth has ever been describ'd as very short, and consequently they cannot be suppos'd to use many Words.</P>
<P>The Circumstance of being buried in the same Urn, is entirely conformable to the Eastern Custom: There are innumerable Instances in the Scriptures of great Personages being buried with their Fathers: So <HI>Joseph</HI> would not suffer his Bones to rest in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> but commands his Brethren to carry them into <HI>Canaan</HI> to the Burying-place of his Father <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>

<P>We have this whole Doctrine very distinctly deliver'd by <HI>Plutarch</HI> in these Words. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Man is a compound Subject; but not of two Parts, as is commonly believed, because the <HI>Understanding</HI> is generally accounted a Part of the <HI>Soul;</HI> whereas indeed it as far exceeds the Soul, as the Soul is diviner than the Body.

Take this Passage out of its poetical Dress, and it will be no more than this: A strong Gale of Wind blew, and so in∣creased the Flame that it soon consum'd the Pile. But <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> introduces the Gods of the Winds in Person: And <HI>Iris,</HI> or the Rainbow, being (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes) a Sign not only
<PB N="124" REF="123"/>
of Showers, but of Winds, he makes them come at her Summons.</P>
<P>Every Circumstance is well adapted: As soon as the Winds see <HI>Iris,</HI> they rise; that is, when the Rainbow appears, the the Wind rises: She refuses to sit, and immediately returns; that is, the Rainbow is never seen long at one time, but soon appears, and soon vanishes: She returns over the Ocean; that is, the Bow is compos'd of Waters, and it would have been an unnatural Fiction to have describ'd her as passing by Land.</P>
<P>The Winds are all together in the Cave of <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> which may imply that they were there as at their general Ren∣dezvous; or that the Nature of all the Winds is the same; or that the Western Wind is in that Countrey the most constant, and consequently it may be said that at such Sea∣sons all the Winds are assembled in one Corner, or rendezvous with <HI>Zephyrus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Iris</HI> will not enter the Cave: It is the Nature of the Rain∣bow to be stretch'd entirely upon the Surface, and therefore this Fiction is agreeable to Reason.</P>
<P>When <HI>Iris</HI> says that the Gods are partaking Hecatombs in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> it is to be remember'd that the Gods are repre∣sented there in the first Book, before the Scenes of War were open'd, and now they are closed, they return thither. <HI>Eustathius—</HI>Thus <HI>Homer</HI> makes the Anger of his Hero so important, that it rouz'd Heaven to Arms, and now when it is almost appeas'd, <HI>Achilles</HI> as it were gives Peace to the Gods.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 320. <HI>The Games for</HI> Patroclus.]</Q> The Conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> in enlarging upon the Games at the Funeral of <HI>Pa∣troclus</HI> is very judicious: There had undoubtedly been such Honours paid to several Heroes during this War, as appears from a Passage in the ninth Book, where <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to en∣hance the Value of the Horses which he offers <HI>Achilles,</HI> says, that any Person would be rich that had Treasures equal to the Value of the Prizes they had won; which Races must have been run during the Seige: for had they been before it, the Horses would now have been too old to be of any Value, this being the tenth Year of the War. But he Poet passes all those Games over in Silence, and reserves them for this Season; not only in honour of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> but also of his Hero <HI>Achilles;</HI> who exhibits Games to a whole Army; great Ge∣nerals are Candidates for the Prizes, and he himself sits the Judge and Arbitrator: Thus in Peace as well as War the Poet maintains the Superiority of the Character of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>But there is another Reason why the Poet deferr'd to relate any Games that were exhibited at any preceding Funerals: The Death of <HI>Patroclus</HI> was the most eminent Period; and consequently the most proper Time for such Games.</P>
<P>'Tis farther observable, that he chuses this peculiar Time with great Judgment. When the Fury of the War rag'd, the Army could not well have found Leisure for the Games, and they might have met with Interruption from the Enemy: But <HI>Hector</HI> being dead, all <HI>Troy</HI> is in Confusion: They are in too great a Consternation to make any Attempts, and therefore the Poet could not possibly have chosen a more happy Opportunity. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<P>It may be added as a farther Justification of <HI>Homer,</HI> that this last Circumstance is very natural: <HI>Achilles</HI> while he com∣mends his Horses remembers how careful <HI>Patroclus</HI> had been of them: His Love for his Friend is so great, that the mi∣nutest Circumstance recalls him to his Mind; and such little Digressions, such Avocations of Thought as these, very na∣turally proceed from the Overflows of Love and Sorrow.</P>

<P><HI>Nestor</HI> says that these <HI>Moliones</HI> overpower'd him by their Number.

Upon the whole, the Description of the Sea-Race I think has the more Poetry and Majesty, that of the Chariots more Nature, and lively Incidents. There is nothing in <HI>Virgil</HI> so picturesque, so animated, or which so much marks the Characters, as the Episodes of <HI>Antilochus</HI> and <HI>Menelaus, Ajax</HI> and <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> with that beautiful Interposition of old <HI>Nestor,</HI> (so naturally introduc'd into an Affair where one so little expects him.) On the other side, in <HI>Virgil</HI> the Descri∣ption itself is much nobler; it has something more osten∣tatiously grand, and seems a Spectacle more worthy the Pre∣sence of Princes and great Persons.</P>
<P>In three other Games we find the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet contend∣ing openly with the <HI>Grecian.</HI> That of the <HI>Caestus</HI> is in great part a verbal Translation: But it must be own'd in favour of <HI>Virgil,</HI> that he has vary'd from <HI>Homer</HI> in the E∣vent of the Combate with admirable Judgment and with an Improvement of the Moral. <HI>Epaeus</HI> and <HI>Dares</HI> are describ'd by both Poets as vain Boasters; but <HI>Virgil</HI> with more poetical Justice punishes <HI>Dares</HI> for his Arrogance, whereas the Pre∣sumption and Pride of <HI>Epaeus</HI> is rewarded by <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>On the contrary, in the Foot-Race, I am of opinion that <HI>Homer</HI> has shewn more Judgment and Morality than <HI>Virgil. Nisus</HI> in the latter is unjust to his Adversary in favour of his Friend <HI>Euryalus;</HI> so that <HI>Euryalus</HI> wins the Race by pal∣pable Fraud, and yet the Poet gives him the first Prize; whereas <HI>Homer</HI> makes <HI>Ulysses</HI> victorious, purely thro' the Mis∣chance of <HI>Ajax,</HI> and his own Piety in invoking <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>
<P>The shooting is also a direct Copy, but with the Addi∣tion of two Circumstances which make a beautiful Gradation. In <HI>Homer</HI> the first Archer cuts the String that held the Bird, and the other shoots him as he is mounting. In <HI>Virgil</HI> the
<PB N="142" REF="141"/>
first only hits the Mast which the Bird was fix'd upon, the second cuts the String, the third shoots him, and the fourth to vaunt the Strength of his Arm directs his Arrow up to Heaven, where it kindles into a Flame, and makes a Pro∣digy. This last is certainly superior to <HI>Homer</HI> in what they call the <HI>Wonderful:</HI> but what is the Intent or Effect of this Prodigy, or whether a Reader is not at least as much sur∣prized at it, as at the most unreasonable Parts in <HI>Homer,</HI> I leave to those Criticks who are more inclin'd to find Faults than I am: Nor shall I observe upon the many literal Imi∣tations in the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet, to object against which were to derogate from the Merit of those fine Passages, which <HI>Virgil</HI> was so very sensible of, that he was resolv'd to take them, at any rate, to himself.</P>
<P>There remain in <HI>Homer</HI> three Games untouch'd by <HI>Virgil;</HI> the Wrestling, the single Combate, and the <HI>Discus.</HI> In <HI>Virgil</HI> there is only the <HI>Lusus Trojae</HI> added, which is purely his own, and must be confest to be inimitable: I don't know whether I may be allow'd to say, it is worth all those three of <HI>Homer?</HI></P>
<P>I could not forgive my self if I omitted to mention in this place the Funeral Games in the sixth <HI>Thebaïd</HI> of <HI>Statius;</HI> it is by much the most beautiful Book of that Poem. It's very remarkable, that he has follow'd <HI>Homer</HI> thro' the whole Course of his Games: There is the Chariot-Race, the Foot-Race, the <HI>Discus,</HI> the <HI>Caestus,</HI> the Wrestling, the single Combate (which is put off in the same manner as in <HI>Homer</HI>) and the Shooting; which last ends (as in <HI>Virgil</HI>) with a Prodigy: Yet in the particular Descriptions of each of these Games this Poet has not borrow'd from either of his Prede∣cessors, and his Poem is so much the worse for it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Redemption of the Body of <HI>Hector.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Gods deliberate about the Redemption of <HI>Hector. Jupiter</HI> sends <HI>Thetis</HI> to <HI>Achilles</HI> to dispose him for the restoring it, and <HI>Iris</HI> to <HI>Priam,</HI> to encourage him to go in Person, and treat for it. The old King, notwith∣standing the Remonstrances of his Queen, makes ready for the Journey, to which he is encourag'd by an Omen from <HI>Jupiter.</HI> He sets forth in his Chariot, with a Waggon loaded with Pre∣sents under the Charge of <HI>Idaeus</HI> the Herald. <HI>Mercury</HI> descends in the Shape of a young Man, and conducts him to the Pavi∣lion of <HI>Achilles.</HI> Their Conversation on the way. <HI>Priam</HI> finds <HI>Achilles</HI> at his Table, casts himself at his Feet, and begs for the Body of his Son; <HI>Achilles,</HI> mov'd with Compassion, grants his Request, detains him one Night in his Tent, and the next Morning sends him home with the Body: The <HI>Trojans</HI> run out to meet him. The Lamentations of <HI>Andromache, He∣cuba,</HI> and <HI>Helen,</HI> with the Solemnities of the Funeral.</P>
<P>The Time of twelve Days is employ'd in this Book, while the Body of <HI>Hector</HI> lies in the Tent of <HI>Achilles.</HI> And as many more are spent in the Truce allow'd for his Interment. The Scene is partly in <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Camp, and partly in <HI>Troy.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 14. <HI>What Seas they measur'd,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> There is something very noble in these Sentiments of <HI>Achilles:</HI> He does not recollect any soft Moments, any Tendernesses that had pass'd between him and <HI>Patroclus,</HI> but he revolves the many Difficulties, the Toils by Land, and the Dangers by Sea, in which they had been Companions: Thus the Poet on all Occasions admirably sustains the Character of <HI>Achilles;</HI> when he play'd upon the Harp in the ninth Book, he sung the Atchievements of Kings; and in this place there is an air of Greatness in his very Sorrows: <HI>Achilles</HI> is as much a Hero when he weeps, as when he fights.</P>
<P>This Passage in <HI>Homer</HI> has not escap'd the Censure of <HI>Plato,</HI> who thought it a Diminution to his Character to be
<PB N="196" REF="194"/>
thus transported with Grief; but the Objection will vanish if we remember that all the Passions of <HI>Achilles</HI> are in the ex∣treme; his Nature is violent, and it would have been an Out∣rage to his general Character to have represented him as mourning moderately for his Friend. <HI>Plato</HI> spoke more like a Philosopher than a Critick when he blamed the Behaviour of <HI>Achilles</HI> as unmanly: These Tears would have ill-become <HI>Plato,</HI> but they are graceful in <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>Besides there is something very instructive in this whole Representation, it shews us the Power of a sincere Friend∣ship, and softens and recommends the Character of <HI>Achil∣les;</HI> the Violence he us'd towards his Enemy is alleviated by the Sincerity he expresses towards his Friend; he is a ter∣rible Enemy, but an amiable Friend.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 36. <HI>But</HI> Neptune <HI>this, and</HI> Pallas <HI>this denies.</HI>]</Q> It is with excellent Art that the Poet carries on this part of his Poem, he shews that he could have contriv'd another way to recover the Body of <HI>Hector,</HI> but as a God is never to
<PB N="197" REF="195"/>
be introduc'd but when human Means fail, he rejects the In∣terposition of <HI>Mercury,</HI> makes use of ordinary Methods, and <HI>Priam</HI> redeems his Son: This gives an Air of Probability to the Relation, at the same time that it advances the Glory of <HI>Achilles;</HI> for the greatest of his Enemies labours to pur∣chase his Favour, the Gods hold a Consultation, and a King becomes his Suppliant. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>Those seven Lines, from <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, have been thought spurious by some of the Ancients: They judg'd it an Indecency that the Goddess of Wisdom and <HI>Achilles</HI> should be equally inexorable; and that it was below the Majesty of the Gods to be said at all to steal. Besides, say they, had <HI>Homer</HI> been acquainted with the Judgment of <HI>Paris,</HI> he would undoubtedly have mention'd it before this time in his Poem, and consequently that Story was of a later Invention: And <HI>Aristarchus</HI> affirms that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is a more modern Word, and never known before the Time of <HI>Hesiod,</HI> who uses it when he speaks of the Daughters of <HI>Praetus;</HI> and adds, that it is appropriated to signify the Incontinence of Women, and cannot be at all apply'd to Men: Therefore others read the last Verse,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q>
These Objections are entirely gather'd from <HI>Eustathius;</HI> to which we may add, that <HI>Macrobius</HI> seems to have been one of those who rejected these Verses, since he affirms that our Author never mentions the Judgment of <HI>Paris.</HI> It may be answer'd, that the Silence of <HI>Homer</HI> in the foregoing part of the Poem, as to the Judgment of <HI>Paris,</HI> is no Argument that he was ignorant of that Story: Perhaps he might think it most proper to unfold the Cause of the Destruction of <HI>Troy</HI> in the Conclusion of the <HI>Ilias;</HI> that the Reader seeing the Wrong done, and the Punishment of that Wrong immedi∣ately following, might acknowledge the Justice of it.</P>
<P>The same Reason will be an answer to the Objection re∣lating to the Anger of <HI>Pallas:</HI> Wisdom cannot be satisfy'd without Justice, and consequently <HI>Pallas</HI> ought not to cease from Resentment, till <HI>Troy</HI> has suffer'd the Deserts of her Crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="196"/>
I cannot think that the Objection about the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is of any Weight; the Date of Words is utterly uncertain, and as no one has been able to determine the Ages of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Hesiod,</HI> so neither can any Person be assured that such Words were not in use in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Days.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 52. <HI>A Lion, not a Man,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> This is a very for∣mal Condemnation of the Morals of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> puts into the Mouth of a God. One may see from this alone that he was far from designing his Hero a virtuous Chara∣cter, yet the Poet artfully introduces <HI>Apollo</HI> in the midst of his Reproaches, intermingling the Hero's Praises with his Blemishes: <HI>Brave tho' he be,</HI> &amp;c. Thus what is the real Merit of <HI>Achilles</HI> is distinguish'd from what is blameable in his Character, and we see <HI>Apollo,</HI> or the God of Wisdom, is no less impartial than just in his Representation of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 114. <HI>And wept her god like Son's approaching Doom.</HI>]</Q> These words are very artfully inserted by the Poet. The Poem could not proceed to the Death of <HI>Achilles</HI> without breaking the Action; and therefore to satisfy the Curiosity of the Reader concerning the Fate of this great Man, he takes care to inform us that his Life draws to a Period, and as it were celebrates his Funeral before his Death.</P>
<P>Such Circumstances as these greatly raise the Character of <HI>Achilles;</HI> he is so truly valiant, that tho' he knows he must fall before <HI>Troy,</HI> yet he does not abstain from the War, but couragiously meets his Death: And here I think it proper to insert an Observation that ought to have been made be∣fore, which is, that <HI>Achilles</HI> did not know that <HI>Hector</HI> was to fall by his Hand; if he had known it, where would have been the mighty Courage in engaging him in a single Com∣bat, in which he was sure to conquer? The contrary
<PB N="199" REF="197"/>
of this is evident from the Words of <HI>Achilles</HI> to <HI>Hector</HI> just before the Combat,

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 141. <HI>Nine Days are past since all the Court above,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> It may be thought that so many Interpositions of the Gods, such Messages from Heaven to Earth, and down to the Seas, are needless Machines; and it may be imagin'd that it is an Offence against Probability that so many Deities should be employ'd to pacify <HI>Achilles:</HI> But I am of Opinion that the Poet conducts this whole Affair with admirable Judgment. The Poem is now almost at the Conclusion, and <HI>Achilles</HI> is to pass from a State of an almost inexorable Resentment to a State of perfect Tranquillity; such a Change could not be brought about by human Means; <HI>Achilles</HI> is too stubborn to obey any thing less than a God: This is evident from his reject∣ing the Persuasion of the whole <HI>Grecian</HI> Army to return to the Battle: So that it appears that this Machinery was ne∣cessary, and consequently a Beauty to the Poem.</P>
<P>It may be farther added, that these several Incidents pro∣ceed from <HI>Jupiter:</HI> It is by his Appointment that so many Gods are employ'd to attend <HI>Achilles.</HI> By these means <HI>Ju∣piter</HI> fulfills the Promise mention'd in the first Book, of ho∣nouring the Son of <HI>Thetis,</HI> and the Poet excellently sustains his Character by representing the inexorable <HI>Achilles</HI> as not parting with the Body of his mortal Enemy, but by the immediate Command of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>If the Poet had conducted these Incidents merely by human Means, or suppos'd <HI>Achilles</HI> to restore the Body of <HI>Hector</HI> en∣tirely out of Compassion, the Draught had been unnatural, because unlike <HI>Achilles:</HI> Such a Violence of Temper was not to be pacify'd by ordinary Methods. Besides, the Poet has
<PB N="200" REF="198"/>
made use of the properest Personages to carry on the Affair; for who could be suppos'd to have so great an Influence upon <HI>Achilles</HI> as his own Mother, who is a Goddess?</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 164. <HI>And thy Heart waste with life-consuming Woe.</HI>]</Q> This Expression in the Original is very particular. Were it to be translated literally it must be render'd, how long wilt thou eat, or prey upon thy own Heart by these Sorrows? And it seems that it was a common way of expressing a deep Sor∣row; and <HI>Pythagoras</HI> uses it in this Sense, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, grieve not excessively, let not sorrow make too great an Impression upon thy Heart. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 168.<HI>—Indulge the am'rous Hour!</HI>]</Q> The Anci∣ents (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) rejected these Verses because of the in∣decent Idea they convey: The Goddess in plain Terms ad∣vises <HI>Achilles</HI> to go to Bed to his Mistress, and tells him a Woman will be a Comfort. The good Bishop is of Opinion, that they ought to be rejected, but the Reason he gives is as extraordinary as that of <HI>Thetis:</HI> Soldiers, says he, have more occasion for something to strengthen themselves with, than for Women: And this is the Reason, continues he, why Wrestlers are forbid all Commerce with that Sex during the whole Time of their Exercise.</P>
<P><HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus</HI> endeavours to justify <HI>Homer</HI> by observing, that this Advice of <HI>Thetis</HI> was not given him to induce him to any Wantonness, but was intended to indulge a nobler Passion, his Desire of Glory: She advises him to go to that Captive who was restor'd to him in a pub∣lick manner, to satisfy his Honour: To that Captive, the Detention of whom had been so great a Punishment to the whole <HI>Grecian</HI> Army: And therefore <HI>Thetis</HI> uses a very pro∣per Motive to comfort her Son, by advising him to gratify at once both his Love and his Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="199"/>
<HI>Plutarch</HI> has likewise labour'd in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Justification; he observes that the Poet has set the Picture of <HI>Achilles</HI> in this place in a very fair and strong point of Light: Tho' <HI>Achilles</HI> had so lately receiv'd his belov'd <HI>Briseïs</HI> from the Hands of <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> tho' he knew that his own Life drew to a sud∣den Period, yet the Hero prevails over the Lover, and he does not haste to indulge his Love: He does not lament <HI>Pa∣troclus</HI> like a common Man by neglecting the Duties of Life, but he abstains from all Pleasures by an Excess of Sorrow, and the Love of his Mistress is lost in that of his Friend.</P>
<P>This Observation excellently justifies <HI>Achilles,</HI> in not in∣dulging himself with the Company of his Mistress: The Hero prevails so much over the Lover, that <HI>Thetis</HI> thinks her self oblig'd to recall <HI>Briseïs</HI> to his Memory. Yet still the Inde∣cency remains. All that can be said in favour of <HI>Thetis</HI> is, that she was Mother to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and consequently might take the greater Freedom with her Son.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> disapproves of both the former Observati∣ons: She has recourse to the Lawfulness of such a Practice between <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Briseïs;</HI> and because such Commerces in those times were reputed honest, therefore she thinks the Ad∣vice was decent: The married Ladies are oblig'd to her for this Observation, and I hope all tender Mothers, when their Sons are afflicted, will advise them to comfort themselves in this manner.</P>
<P>In short, I am of Opinion that this Passage outrages De∣cency; and 'tis a sign of some Weakness to have so much occasion of Justification. Indeed the whole Passage is capa∣ble of a serious Construction, and of such a Sense as a Mo∣ther might express to a Son with Decency: And then it will run thus; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why art thou, my Son, thus afflicted? Why thus re∣sign'd to Sorrow? Can neither Sleep nor Love divert you? Short is thy Date of Life, spend it not all in weeping, but allow some part of it to Love and Pleasure!"</Q> But still the In∣decency lies in the manner of the Expression, which must be allow'd to be almost obscene, (for such is the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>misceri</HI>) all that can be said in Defence of it is, that as we are not competent Judges of what Ideas Words might carry in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Time, so we ought not entirely to condemn
<PB N="202" REF="200"/>
him, because it is possible the Expression might not sound so indecently in ancient as in modern Ears.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 447, <HI>&amp;c. The Speech of</HI> Mercury <HI>to</HI> Priam.]</Q> I shall not trouble the Reader with the Dreams of <HI>Eustathius,</HI> who tells us that this Fiction of <HI>Mercury</HI> is partly true, and partly false: 'Tis true that his Father is old, rich, and has seven Children; for <HI>Jupiter</HI> is King of the whole Universe, was from Eternity, and created both Men and Gods: In like man∣ner, when <HI>Mercury</HI> says he is the seventh Child of his Father, <HI>Eustathius</HI> affirms that he meant that there were six Planets besides <HI>Mercury.</HI> Sure it requires great Pains and Thought to be so learnedly absurd: The Supposition which he makes afterwards is far more natural; <HI>Priam,</HI> says he, might by chance meet with one of the <HI>Myrmidons,</HI> who might conduct him unobserv'd thro' the Camp into the Presence of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and as the Execution of any wise Design is ascrib'd to <HI>Pallas,</HI> so may this clandestine Enterprize be said to be manag'd by the Guidance of <HI>Mercury.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="206"/>
But perhaps this whole Passage may be better explain'd by having recourse to the Pagan Theology: It was an Opinion that obtain'd in those early Days, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> frequently sent some friendly Messengers to protect the Innocent, so that <HI>Homer</HI> might intend to give his Readers a Lecture of Mora∣lity, by telling us that this unhappy King was under the Protection of the Gods.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> carries it farther. <HI>Homer</HI> (says she) instructed by Tradition, knew that God sends his Angels to the Succour of the afflicted. The Scripture is full of Examples of this Truth. The Story of <HI>Tobit</HI> has a won∣derful Relation with this of <HI>Homer: Tobit</HI> sent his Son to <HI>Rages,</HI> a City of <HI>Media,</HI> to receive a considerable Sum; <HI>Tobias</HI> did not know the Way; he found at his Door a young Man cloath'd with a majestick Glory, which attracted Ad∣miration: It was an Angel under the Form of a Man. This Angel being ask'd who he was, answer'd (as <HI>Mercury</HI> does here) by a Fiction: He said that he was of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> that his Name was <HI>Azarias,</HI> and that he was Son of <HI>Ananias.</HI> This Angel conducted <HI>Tobias</HI> in Safety; he gave him Instru∣ctions; and when he was to receive the Recompence which the Father and Son offer'd him, he declar'd that he was the Angel of the Lord, took his Flight towards heaven, and dis∣appear'd. Here is a great Conformity in the Ideas and in the Style; and the Example of our Author so long before <HI>Tobit,</HI> proves, that this Opinion of God's sending his Angels to the Aid of Man was very common, and much spread a∣mongst the Pagans in those former Times. <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>

<P>I am of Opinion that such fixed Tents were not used by the <HI>Grecians</HI> in their common Marches, but only during the time of Sieges, when their long stay in one Place made it necessary to build such Tents as are here describ'd; at o∣ther times they lay like <HI>Diomed</HI> in the tenth Book, in the open Air, their Spears standing upright, to be ready upon any Alarm; and with the Hides of Beasts spread on the Ground instead of a Bed.</P>
<P>It is worthy Observation that <HI>Homer</HI> even upon so trivial an Occasion as the describing the Tent of <HI>Achilles,</HI> takes an Opportunity to shew the superior Strength of his Hero; and tells us that three Men could scarce open the Door of his Pavilion, but <HI>Achilles</HI> could open it alone.</P>

To this end the Poet uses no Preamble, but breaks directly into that Circumstance which is most likely to mollify him, and the two first Words he utters are, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>see thy Father, O</HI> Achilles, <HI>in me!</HI> Nothing could be more happily imagin'd than this Entrance into his Speech; <HI>Achilles</HI> has e∣very where been describ'd as bearing a great Affection to his Father, and by two Words the Poet recalls all the Tender∣ness that Love and Duty can suggest to an affectionate Son.</P>
<P><HI>Priam</HI> tells <HI>Achilles</HI> that <HI>Hector</HI> fell in the Defence of his Country: I am far from thinking that this was inserted acci∣dentally; it could not fail of having a very good Effect up∣on <HI>Achilles,</HI> not only as one brave Man naturally loves ano∣ther, but as it implies that <HI>Hector</HI> had no particular Enmity against <HI>Achilles,</HI> but that tho' he fought against him it was in Defence of his Country.</P>
<P>The Reader will observe that <HI>Priam</HI> repeats the Begin∣ning of his Speech, and recalls his Father to his Memory in the Conclusion of it.

Reason for it.

The Meaning of the Passage I fancy may be this: <HI>Priam</HI> perceiving that his address had mollify'd the Heart of <HI>Achilles,</HI> takes this Opportunity to persuade him to give over the War, and re∣turn home; especially since his Anger was sufficiently satisfy'd by the Fall of <HI>Hector.</HI> Immediately <HI>Achilles</HI> takes fire at this Proposal, and answers, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it not enough that I have de∣termin'd to restore thy Son?

<P>This Opinion may be farther establish'd from what follows in the latter end of this Interview, where <HI>Achilles</HI> asks <HI>Priam</HI> how many Days he would request for the Interment of <HI>Hector?

<P>We have now past thro' the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and seen the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and the terrible Effects of it, at an end: As that only was the Subject of the Poem, and the Nature of Epic Poetry would not permit our Author to proceed to the Event of the War, it may perhaps be acceptable to the common Reader to give a short Account of what happen'd to <HI>Troy</HI> and the chief Actors in this Poem, after the Conclusion of it.</P>
<P>I need not mention that <HI>Troy</HI> was taken soon after the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> by the Stratagem of the wooden Horse, the Par∣ticulars of which are describ'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the second Book of the <HI>Aeneis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Achilles</HI> fell before <HI>Troy,</HI> by the Hand of <HI>Paris,</HI> by the Shot of an Arrow in his Heel, as <HI>Hector</HI> had prophesied at his Death, <HI>Lib.</HI> 22.</P>
<P>The unfortunate <HI>Priam</HI> was kill'd by <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> the Son of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ajax</HI> after the Death of <HI>Achilles</HI> had a Contest with <HI>Ulysses</HI> for the Armour of <HI>Vulcan,</HI> but being defeated in his Aim, he slew himself thro' Indignation.</P>
<P><HI>Helen,</HI> after the Death of <HI>Paris,</HI> married <HI>Deïphobus</HI> his Brother, and at the taking of <HI>Troy</HI> betray'd him, in order
<PB N="220" REF="218"/>
to reconcile herself to <HI>Menelaus</HI> her first Husband, who re∣ceiv'd her again into Favour.</P>
<P><HI>Agamemnon</HI> at his return was barbarously murther'd by <HI>Aegysthus</HI> at the Instigation of <HI>Clytaemnestra</HI> his Wife, who in his Absence had dishonour'd his Bed with <HI>Aegysthus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Diomed</HI> after the Fall of <HI>Troy</HI> was expell'd his own Coun∣trey, and scarce escap'd with Life from his adulterous Wife <HI>Aegiale;</HI> but at last was receiv'd by <HI>Daunus</HI> in <HI>Apulia,</HI> and shar'd his Kingdom: 'Tis uncertain how he died.</P>
<P><HI>Nestor</HI> liv'd in Peace, with his Children, in <HI>Pylos</HI> his na∣tive Countrey.</P>
<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> also after innumerable Troubles by Sea and Land, at last return'd in Safety to <HI>Ithaca,</HI> which is the Subject of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Odysses.</HI></P>

<DIV1 TYPE="endnote">
<P>I must end these Notes by discharging my Duty to two of my Friends, which is the more an indispensable piece of Justice, as the one of them is since dead: The Merit of their Kindness to me will appear infinitely the greater, as the Task they undertook was in its own nature of much more Labour, than either Pleasure or Reputation. The larger part of the Extracts from <HI>Eustathius,</HI> together with several excellent Ob∣servations were sent me by Mr. <HI>Broome:</HI> And the whole Essay upon <HI>Homer</HI> was written upon such Memoirs as I had col∣lected, by the late Dr. <HI>Parnell,</HI> Archdeacon of <HI>Clogher</HI> in <HI>Ireland:</HI> How very much that Gentleman's Friendship pre∣vail'd over his Genius, in detaining a Writer of his Spirit in the Drudgery of removing the Rubbish of past Pedants, will soon appear to the World, when they shall see those beautiful Pieces of Poetry the Publication of which he left to my Charge, almost with his dying Breath.</P>
<P>For what remains, I beg to be excus'd from the Ceremo∣nies of taking leave at the End of my Work; and from em∣barassing myself, or others, with any Defences or Apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to raise a vain Monu∣ment to my self, of the Merits or Difficulties of it (which must be left to the World, to Truth, and to Posterity) let me leave behind me a Memorial of my Friendship, with one of the most valuable Men as well as finest Writers, of my

Age and Countrey: One who has try'd, and knows by his own Experience, how hard an Undertaking it is to do Justice to <HI>Homer:</HI> And one, who (I am sure) sincerely re∣joices with me at the Period of my Labours. To Him there∣fore, having brought this long Work to a Conclusion, I de∣sire to <HI>Dedicate</HI> it; and to have the Honour and Satisfa∣ction of placing together, in this manner, the Names of Mr. <HI>CONGREVE,</HI> and of</P>
