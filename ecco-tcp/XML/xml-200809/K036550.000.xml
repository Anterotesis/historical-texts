<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. WROUGHTON.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>OF all who strive to please the publick car,</L>
<L>Most bold is he who dares attempt it here;</L>
<L>Where four tribunals, a tremendous show,</L>
<L>Plain folk above, and finer folk below,</L>
<L>All sit to try an anxious Author's cause,</L>
<L>Each by its own, and all by different laws.</L>
<L>This beauteous circle, friends to polish'd verse,</L>
<L>Admires soft sentiments in language terse;</L>
<L>While the stern Pit all ornament disdains,</L>
<L>And loves deep pathos, and sublimer strains.</L>
<L>The middle order, free from critick pride,</L>
<L>Take genuine nature for their faithful guide;</L>
<L>At ears and eyes they drink the full delight,</L>
<L>And judge, but as they feel, of wrong and right:</L>
<L>While those above them, honest souls! delight in</L>
<L>Processions, bustle, trumpets, drums, and fighting.</L>
<L>Hard as it is, we think our Play to-night</L>
<L>Has something fit for every appetite.—</L>
<L>For tender souls are tender griefs prepar'd,</L>
<STAGE>To the Boxes.</STAGE>
<L>And scenes of direr woe for breasts more hard;</L>
<STAGE>To the Pit.</STAGE>
<L>By interesting your passions, we must try</L>
<STAGE>To the Middle Gallery.</STAGE>
<L>To bribe the heart while we defraud the eye;</L>
<L>And though no trumpets sound, nor drums will rattle,</L>
<L>You, friends, shall <HI>hear</HI> of a most desperate battle.</L>
<STAGE>To the Upper Gallery.</STAGE>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="7"/>
<L>Thus provident for all, we trust you'll own,</L>
<L>Our poet's zeal may for some faults atone:</L>
<L>In this, at least, he hopes you'll all agree,</L>
<L>To shield him from the critick's treachery;</L>
<L>Who, with sly rules upon your judgement stealing,</L>
<L>Would set your pride against your honest feeling;</L>
<L>Would shame the generous drops that swell your eyes,</L>
<L>And teach you your own virtues to despise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Permit me, ere I go, one short relation,</L>
<L>And just three words by way of application.</L>
<L>A home-spun country 'squire, who took his stand</L>
<L>To see a dex'trous juggler's sleight of hand,</L>
<L>Was thus accosted by an envious wight,</L>
<L>Who sought to hurt the artist from pure spight:</L>
<L>"Sir, for these tricks I'll presently expose them;</L>
<L>"There's nothing in't, I'll show you how he does "them."</L>
<L>How think you the proposal was receiv'd?</L>
<L>"No, (says the 'squire) I pay to be deceiv'd."</L>
<L>Thus Criticks, when poor Authors they condemn,</L>
<L>Mean nothing kind to you, but spleen to them:</L>
<L>Then still mistrust, whate'er he may profess,</L>
<L>The friend who strives to make your pleasure less.</L>

<L>O bitter memory! gone, gone for ever!</L>
<L>The pillar of my house, my only son!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas terrible indeed.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ay, was it not?</L>
<L>And then the manner of it; think on that:</L>
<L>Disease, that robb'd me of two infant sons,</L>
<L>Approaching slow, bade me prepare to lose them;</L>
<L>I saw my lilies drooping; and, accustom'd</L>
<L>To see them dying, bore to see them dead:</L>
<L>But O my Edmund!—Thou remember'st, Fabian,</L>
<L>How blithe he went to seek the forest's sport.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Would I could not remember!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>That curs'd Barb</L>
<L>(My fatal gift) that dash'd him down the cliff,</L>
<L>Seem'd proud or his gay burden.—Breathless, mangled,</L>
<L>They bore him back to me. Fond man! I hoped</L>
<L>This day his happy match with Isabel</L>
<L>Had made our line perpetual; and, this day,</L>
<L>The unfruitful grave receives him. Yes, 'tis fate;</L>
<L>That dreadful denunciation 'gainst my house</L>
<L>No prudence can avert, nor prayers can soften.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Think not on that; some visionary's dream.</L>
<L>What house, what family could e'er know peace,</L>
<L>If each enthusiast's ravings were believ'd,</L>
<L>And frenzy deem'd an insight of the future?</L>
<L>But may I dare to ask, is it of moment</L>
<L>To stir your anger thus, that Isabel</L>
<L>Has left the castle?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of the deepest moment;</L>
<L>My best hope hangs on her; some future time,</L>
<L>I may instruct thee why.—These cares unhinge me.</L>
<L>Just now, a herald from her angry father</L>
<L>Left me this dire election,—to resign</L>
<L>My titles, and this ample signory,</L>
<L>(Worthy a monarch's envy,) or to meet him,</L>
<L>And try my right by arms. But pr'ythee tell,</L>
<L>(Nor let a fear to wound thy master's pride</L>
<L>Restrain thy licens'd speech,) hast thou e'er heard</L>
<L>My father Raymond—cast not down thine eye—</L>
<L>By any indirect or bloody means</L>
<L>Procur'd that instrument, Alphonso's will,</L>
<L>That made him heir to Narbonne?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>My best lord,</L>
<L>At all times would I fain with-hold from you</L>
<L>Intelligence unwelcome, but most now.</L>
<L>At seasons such as this, a friendly tongue</L>
<L>Should utter words like balm; but what you ask—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>—I ask to be inform'd of. Hast thou known me</L>
<L>From childhood up to man, and canst thou fear</L>
<L>I am so weak of soul, like a thin reed,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="12"/>To bend and stagger at each puny blast?</L>
<L>No; when the tempest rages round my head,</L>
<L>I give my branches wider to the air,</L>
<L>And strike my root more deeply.—To thy tale:</L>
<L>Away with palliatives and compliment;—</L>
<L>Speak plainly.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Plainly then, my lord, I have heard</L>
<L>What, for the little breath I have to draw,</L>
<L>I would not, to the black extent of rumour,</L>
<L>Give credit to.—But you command me speak—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy pauses torture me.—Can I hear worse</L>
<L>Than this black scroll contains; this challenge here</L>
<L>From Isabella's father, haughty Godfrey?</L>
<L>In broad and unambiguous words he tells me</L>
<L>My father was a murderer, and forg'd</L>
<L>Alphonso's testament.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>From Palestine</L>
<L>That tale crept hither; where, foul slander says,</L>
<L>The good Alphonso, not, as we believe,</L>
<L>Died of a fever, but a venom'd draught,</L>
<L>Your father, his companion of the cross,</L>
<L>Did with his own hand mingle; his hand too</L>
<L>(Assisted by some cunning practisers)</L>
<L>Model'd that deed, which, barring Godfrey's right,</L>
<L>And other claims from kindred, nam'd Count Raymond</L>
<L>Lord of these fair possessions.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! I have it;</L>
<L>'Tis Godfrey's calumny; he has coin'd this lie;</L>
<L>And his late visit to the holy land,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13"/>No doubt, has furnish'd likelihood of proof,</L>
<L>To give his fiction colour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sure 'tis so.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>He too has forg'd this idle prophecy,</L>
<L>(To shake me with false terrors) this prediction,</L>
<L>Which but to think of used to freeze my veins;</L>
<L>"That no descendant from my father's loins</L>
<L>"Should live to see a grandson, nor heaven's wrath</L>
<L>"Cease to afflict us, till Alphonso's heir</L>
<L>"Succeeded to his just inheritance."</L>
<L>Hence Superstition mines my tottering state,</L>
<L>Loosens my vassals' faith, and turns their tears,</L>
<L>Which else would fall for my calamities,</L>
<L>To gloomy pause, and gaping reverence:</L>
<L>While all my woes, to their perverted sense,</L>
<L>Seem but the marvellous accomplishment</L>
<L>Of revelation, out of nature's course.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Reason must so interpret. Good my lord,</L>
<L>What answer was return'd to Godfrey's challenge?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Defiance.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FABIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Heaven defend you!</L>

<L>Heaven defend me!</L>
<L>I hope it will; and this right arm to boot.</L>
<L>But, hark! I hear a noise.—Perhaps my people</L>

<SPEAKER>COUNT,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>alone.</STAGE>
<L>She eyed me with abhorrence; at the sound</L>
<L>Of love, of marriage, sled indignant from me.</L>
<L>Yet I must win her: should she meet my wish,</L>
<L>Godfrey would prop the right he strives to shake,</L>
<L>Securing thus to his fair daughter's issue</L>
<L>All that now hangs on the sword's doubtful point.</L>
<L>Her beauty too, each soft attractive grace,</L>
<L>I saw with jealous pleasure, even when destin'd</L>
<L>To my son's arms. His death removes one bar;</L>

<L>Damnation!</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Near the cloister,</L>
<L>From whence, by the flat door's descent, a passage</L>
<L>Beneath the ground leads onward to the convent,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="15"/>We heard the echo of a falling weight,</L>
<L>And sought it by the sound.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, and what then?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>The unsettled dust left us no room to doubt</L>
<L>The door had just been rais'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>She has escap'd,</L>
<L>And by confed'racy: to force that bar,</L>
<L>Without more aid, had baffled twice her strength.</L>
<L>Go on.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>We enter'd; with resistance bold,</L>
<L>This peasant push'd us backward from the spot.</L>
<L>My arm was rais'd to smite him, but respect</L>
<L>For something in his aspect check'd the blow.</L>
<L>He, chiding, parlying by turns, gave time</L>
<L>For whosoever had descended there</L>
<L>(The lady doubtless) to elude our search:</L>
<L>The rest himself will tell.</L>

<STAGE>To the Peasant.</STAGE>
<L>Ha! what art thou?</L>

<L>It seems thy prisoner: disengage me first</L>

<L>Unhand him. I should know thee; I have seen</L>
<L>Features like thine. Answer me, wert thou found</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>They saw not that.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>They saw it not! How! could her delicate hands,</L>
<L>Weak, soft, and yielding to the gentlest touch,</L>
<L>Sustain that pond'rous mass? No; those tough arms,</L>
<L>Thy force, assisted; else, thou young dissembler—</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>She had been seiz'd, and by compulsion brought</L>

<L>Thou dost avow it then,</L>

<L>Less than I should be; more than what I seem.</L>

<L>Hence with this saucy ambiguity.</L>
<L>What is thy name, thy country? That mean habit</L>
<L>(Which should teach humbleness) speaks thy condition.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>My name is Theodore, my country France;</L>
<L>My habit little suited to my mind,</L>
<L>Less to my birth; yet sit for my condition.</L>

<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, thou art then some young adventurer,</L>
<L>Some roving knight, a hero in disguise,</L>
<L>Who, scorning forms of vulgar ceremony,</L>
<L>No leave obtain'd, waiting no invitation,</L>
<L>Enters our castles, wanders o'er our halls,</L>
<L>To succour dames distress'd, or pilfer gold.</L>
<L>Where are your train, your pages, and your squires?</L>
<L>Perhaps but poorly lodg'd! I am to blame;</L>
<L>But must excuse my scanted courtesy,</L>
<L>By ignorance of your high character.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>There is a source of reverence for thee here,</L>
<L>Forbids me, though provok'd, retort thy taunts.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>If I endure this more, I shall grow vile</L>
<L>Even to my hinds—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hold, let me stop thy wrath.</L>
<L>I see thy quivering lip, thy firy eye,</L>
<L>Forerun a storm of passion. To prevent thee</L>
<L>From terms too harsh, perhaps, for thee to offer,</L>
<L>Or me to hear (poor as I seem) with honour,</L>
<L>I will cut short thy interrogatories,</L>
<L>And on this theme give thee the full extent</L>
<L>Of all I know, or thou canst wish to learn.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Do it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Without a view to thwart thy purpose</L>
<L>(Be what it might), was I within thy walls.</L>
<L>In a dim passage of the castle-ailes</L>
<L>Musing alone, I heard a hasty tread,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="18"/>And breath drawn short, like one in fear of peril.</L>
<L>A lady enter'd, (fair she seem'd, and young,)</L>
<L>Guiding her timorous footsteps by a lamp:</L>
<L>"The lord, the tyrant of this place (she cried)</L>
<L>"For a detested purpose follows me;</L>
<L>"Aid me▪ good youth:" then, pointing to the ground,</L>
<L>"That door (she added) leads to sanctuary."</L>
<L>I seiz'd an iron hold, and, while I tugg'd</L>
<L>To heave the unwilling weight, I learn'd her title.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>The lady Isabel?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>The same. A gleam,</L>
<L>Shot from their torches who pursued her track,</L>
<L>Prevented more; she hasten'd to the cave,</L>
<L>And vanish'd from my sight.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>And did no awe,</L>
<L>No fear of him she call'd this castle's lord,</L>
<L>Its tyrant, chill thee?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Awe nor fear I know not,</L>
<L>And trust shall never; for I know not guilt.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then thou, it seems, art master here, not I;</L>
<L>Thou canst control my projects, blast my schemes,</L>
<L>And turn to empty air my power in Narbonne.</L>
<L>Nay, should my daughter choose to fly my castle,</L>
<L>Against my bidding, guards and bolts were vain:</L>
<L>This frize-clad champion, gallant Theodore,</L>
<L>Would lend his ready arm, and mock my caution.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy daughter! O, I were indeed too bless'd,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>My daughter would, I hope, disdain thy service.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wherefore am I to blame? What I have done,</L>
<L>Were it to do again, again I'd do it.</L>
<L>And may this arm drop palsied by my side,</L>
<L>When its cold sinews shrink to aid affliction!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEASANT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed. Frown on. Ask thy own heart,—</L>
<L>Did innocence and beauty bend before thee,</L>
<L>Hunted and trembling, would'st thou tamely pause,</L>
<L>Scanning pale counsel from deliberate fear,</L>
<L>And weigh each possibility of danger?</L>
<L>No; the instinctive nobleness of blood</L>
<L>Would start beyond the reach of such cold scruples,</L>
<L>And instant gratify its generous ardour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COUNT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
<L>I must know more of this. His phrase, his look,</L>

<DIV1 TYPE="epilogue">
<P>THE following EPILOGUE, which was spoken on the first two nights of the exhibition of this tragedy, was obligingly written by R. J. GOODENOUGH, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who did not know that an Epilogue had been prepared for it by Mr. Malone, at the Author's request.</P>
<LG>
<L>'TIS an old maxim with dramatick sages,</L>
<L>To draw their tragick lore from distant ages.</L>
<L>The ruder manners, and impetuous vein,</L>
<L>Which no trim rules of <HI>etiquette</HI> restrain;</L>
<L>The gen'rous plainness of th' unpractis'd heart,</L>
<L>Nature's free powers yet unsubdued by art;</L>
<L>The rough simplicity,—the darksome time,—</L>
<L>Improve the <HI>pathos,</HI>—heighten the sublime:</L>
<L>While all the Poet's deepest skill might fail,</L>
<L>If us'd to decorate some modern tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In me you've seen a wife—who, though abhorr'd,</L>
<L>Abandon'd, threaten'd by her tyrant Lord,</L>
<L><PB REF="92"/>Did patient long her firm affection prove,</L>
<L>'Midst the keen tortures of insulted love.</L>
<L>You've seen a maiden—fair, and nobly born,</L>
<L>Attach'd to merit, wretched and forlorn;</L>
<L>And then, her lover, in a mean disguise,</L>
<L>In native worth above all titles rise.</L>
<L>A priest—with zeal and holy ardour fraught,</L>
<L>Practise the lessons which his preaching taught.</L>
<L>—But while at scenes like these your bosoms glow,</L>
<L>You'll recollect, they happen'd—long ago.</L>
<L>In <HI>our</HI> gay times, a wife forsaken, scorn'd,</L>
<L>Had ne'er in doleful guise her fortune mourn'd;</L>
<L>But with frail schemes; in fashionable course,</L>
<L>Had been the <HI>first</HI> to furnish a divorce.</L>
<L>The maiden had her peasant swain despis'd,</L>
<L>And stars, and lace, and liv'ries, more had priz'd.</L>
<L>Nor could, in this, perhaps, her choice be blam'd;</L>
<L>For say, what lover now had other merit claim'd?</L>
<L>As for our priests—in rev'rence let them rest;—</L>
<L>On modern saints—the least that's said, is best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of manners, then, so different in their kind,</L>
<L>The old are rude—the new are too refin'd.</L>
<L>That author well deserves our warmest praise,</L>
<L>Who those examples which we need displays.</L>
<L>Who, 'midst the placid murmurings of <HI>Ton,</HI></L>
<L>Rolls the rough tide of Gothick force along;</L>
<L>And when true worth seems withering at the root,</L>
<L>Turns the rich soil whence towering virtues shoot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ne'er can the Muse be more our nature's friend,</L>
<L>Than when she strives its wide extremes to blend;</L>
<L>Bids simple truth with polish'd fashion join,</L>
<L>And ancient strength with modern grace combine.</L>
