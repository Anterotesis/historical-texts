<P>A TRAGEDY.</P>
<P>As it is acted <HI>By his</HI> MAJESTY's <HI>Servants,</HI> AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, IN <HI>DRURY-LANE.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE following Piece was design'd as a Kind of Mirror to the present Rebellion; and the ima∣gined: Advantage of having it acted before that unnatu∣ral Flame could be extinguish'd, was the Reason why it was so hurry'd in the writing; being begun and finish'd in less Time than is necessary tor the forming the Fable only of a correct Play. It was the six Weeks Labour of an Actor, who, even in that short Space, was often call'd from it by his Profession. The Players, for the Sake of Dispatch, had it to study, Act by Act, just as it was blotted; and the only Revisals it received, from the <HI>Brouillon</HI> to the <HI>Press,</HI> were at the Rehearsals of it. So that we must bespeak the Reader's Indulgence for numberless Incorrections thro' the Whole; but more particularly for the Measure and Diction; the Author having neglected them so much, that he cannot call the Manner, in which it is written, either Prose or Verse, but accidentally both. It is certain, Apologies for bad writing seldom procure Re∣mission from the Rigid; yet the most flagrant Crimes when ingenuously confess'd, and follow'd by Repentance, admit of Extenuation from the Benevolent.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Lines mark'd with Commas were omitted after the first Night's acting, the Play being too long in the Performance.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>MACKLIN.</HI></BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>BReathes there a <HI>Briton</HI> longs for Popish Chains,</L>
<L>While <HI>Smithfield</HI> Fire our <HI>English</HI> Annals Stains;</L>
<L>When <HI>Popish</HI> Rage and Persecution blaz'd</L>
<L>With <HI>British</HI> Blood on Altars <HI>Rome</HI> had raised;</L>
<L>When Matrons saw their Sons in Flames expire,</L>
<L>Their Husbands crackling in religious Fire.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Rome</HI> gave Laws, our Kings and Council sway'd,</L>
<L>While <HI>Albion</HI> mourn'd her Liberties betray'd.</L>
<L>But now she smiles; our Laws are all our own,</L>
<L>Which rule alike the Cottage and the Throne.</L>
<L>No Tools of Power our Properties invade,</L>
<L>No Heads are chopt for Plots the Court hath made.</L>
<L>By such base Arts her Empire <HI>Rome</HI> maintains,</L>
<L>Axes her Arguments, her Logic Chains;</L>
<L>To these a Martyr gallant <HI>Russel</HI> fell,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sidney</HI> bled, whose Crime was writing well.</L>
<L>But under <HI>George</HI> such Practice is unknown,</L>
<L>For free-born Subjects guard and grace his Throne.</L>
<L>A Prince like him our Author shews to Night,</L>
<L>Who fought for Freedom and his regal Right.</L>
<L>The temporary Piece in Haste was writ,</L>
<L>The six Weeks Labour of a puny Wit;</L>
<L>With melting Measure, Critic Rules unfraught,</L>
<L>Artless he writes,—just as rude Nature taught:</L>
<L>No golden Lines, no polish'd Verse hath he,</L>
<L>But all like <HI>British</HI> Courage, rough and free.</L>
<L>For once then—</L>
<L>Judge not by Critic, but by patriot Laws;</L>
<L>Where Genius fails, support your fav'rite Cause.</L>

<SP>
<L>BY <HI>Hal</HI> deliver'd from my marriage Vows,</L>
<L><HI>Catherine</HI> again is free to chuse a Spouse.</L>
<L>The Man, who offers fairest, shall succeed,</L>
<L>If <HI>British</HI> born, or of old <HI>Huntley's</HI> Breed.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Rome</HI>-nursed Husbands I have had enough,</L>
<L>O Ladies, they are all such dastard Stuff,</L>
<L>That I my self, equip'd in Cap and Jerkin,</L>
<L>Am every whit as good a Prince as <HI>Perkin.</HI></L>
<L>'Tis true the Boy was loving, soft and tender,</L>
<L>But in the Main an arrant poor Pretender.</L>
<L>Jesting a-part,—now Ladies, what do you say?</L>
<L>What is your Judgment of this hasty Play?</L>
<L>For your Decision here the Author stands;</L>
<L>Let the poor Rogue have Mercy at your Hands.</L>
<L>In sooth we're much beholden to his Art;</L>
<L>For in a female Form he hath placed a manly Heart;</L>
<L>And if in her bright Character you find</L>
<L>Superior Spirit and a <HI>Roman</HI> Mind,</L>
<L>Know, from the Life her Principles he drew,</L>
<L>And hopes the Piece shall live which copies you.</L>

<L><HI>FRION,</HI> we all were on the Brink of Fate;</L>
<L>A Nobleman who knew him, when a Child,</L>
<L>Avow'd him an Impostor, born at <HI>Tournay</HI>;</L>
<L>The Son of one <HI>John Osbec</HI>;—not the Heir</L>
<L>Of <HI>England's</HI> King—audaciously assumed.</L>
<L>This stagger'd many of the Court, who warmly</L>
<L>Opposed his Audience; I at length stood up,</L>
<L>And in full Council strait produced our Letters</L>
<L>From <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> his Holiness the Pope,</L>
<L>And <HI>Maximilian</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI>;</L>
<L>And as they all recognize his royal Birth,</L>
<L>The Objection vanish'd; and the King resolved,</L>

<L>Most reverend Sir, your Industry and Zeal,</L>

<SPEAKER>Sevez.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Frion,</HI> with religious Joy we will revenge</L>
<L>The irreverent Contempts, lately offer'd</L>
<L>To our holy Church, by unholy <HI>England,</HI></L>
<L>My Functions, secular and religious,</L>
<L>Shall to their utmost, stretch, to fix this <HI>Perkin</HI></L>
<L>On <HI>England's</HI> Throne. <HI>Henry</HI> hath refused</L>
<L>Our King, by my Contrivance, his Daughter</L>
<L><HI>Margaret</HI>; which affront hath sown the Seeds</L>
<L>Of Hate too deep within his youthful Mind</L>
<L>Ever to be weeded out. His Soul's on fire,</L>
<L>And burns with Eagerness to pour Invasion</L>
<L>Into their haughty Land; to loose at once</L>
<L>His unremitting Grudge, on a proud Neighbour,</L>
<L>And a dreaded Rival. But, <HI>Frion,</HI> tho' we</L>
<L>Abound in <HI>Scottish</HI> Blood, ready to be drain'd</L>
<L>Against <HI>England's</HI> Peace, yet Treasure is War's</L>

<L>By Gold and Promises have I firmly fixt.</L>

<L>So far then Probability attends us,</L>

<L>Can he affect the Blush of Innocence?</L>
<Q><L>Hath he the steadfast Eye that looks against</L>

<L>For to a crowded Presence he must speak.</L></Q>
</SP>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Frion.</SPEAKER>
<L>He is not to be taught his Lesson now:</L>
<L>The blended Care of Nature and of Art</L>
<L>Have stamp'd him perfect; a majestic Mein,</L>
<L>A Countenance, where Sweetness and Command</L>
<L>Smile awfully together; a Deportment,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="9"/>Courtly, but not effeminate; a Skill,</L>
<L>That calls him Master of most Languages;</L>
<L>But chiefly <HI>English</HI>; with a soothing Carriage</L>
<L>Which beggars the Persuasion of his Tongue.</L>
<L>His suppos'd Aunt, <HI>Margaret of Burgundy,</HI></L>
<L>Has form'd his Education; she has made him</L>
<L>A living History of <HI>England's</HI> Factions;</L>
<L>The various Interests, Battles, Revolutions,</L>
<L>The Friends, the Enemies of either House,</L>
<L>This of <HI>Plantagenet,</HI> or that of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></L>
<L>He is Master of many Languages;</L>
<L>But chiefly <HI>English</HI>; to ingratiate him</L>
<L>With the People, and stamp him native.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sevez.</SPEAKER>
<L>The King is soft and warm, susceptible of Pity,</L>
<L>Prompt to receive th' Impression of Humanity;</L>
<L>If <HI>Perkin</HI> do but tell his Tale with Skill,</L>
<L>Th' unwary Youth will sympathize in Sorrow</L>
<L>And take and keep what Form his Art bestows.</L>
</SP></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frion.</SPEAKER>
<L>Doubt not his Art, my Lord, he is com∣pleat;</L>
<L>And often has rehears'd his kingly Part</L>
<L>In <HI>France,</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and in <HI>Italy</HI>;</L>
<L>Where admiring Crowds have wonder'd forth his Praise.</L>
<L>And given natural Marks of Majesty;</L>
<L>In Look, Tone, Gesture, Gate, and Voice:</L>
<L>And credulous tale-believing Women,</L>
<L>To whom Appearances are sacred Truths,</L>
<L>Have, at his well-told Tale dissolved in Tears.</L>
<L>Thus, my Lord, like a graceful, well-skill'd Actor,</L>

<L>I have not been used to silken Coverli Is,</L>

<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>And swampy Earth; and my best Lodging oft</L>
<L>Hath been the dryest Turf, the blooming Hether,</L>

<L>Their Songs were not who steep'd deepest in <HI>Italian</HI></L>
<L>Luxury, or deck'd gayest in foreign Frippery,</L>
<L>But who had most Wounds in Battle, or fought</L>
<L>Hardiest in their Country's Cause. This Court</L>
<L>Was not then the Rendezvous of <HI>Italian</HI> Minstrels,</L>

<L>Of <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobility, whose Ancestors</L>

<L>There searching for my dear, my darling, only Son,</L>
<L>I found his well-known, headless Trunk, all gash'd</L>

<STAGE><HI>King</HI> HENRY, STANLEY, YORK.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>MY Lords, no longer let us doubt the Truth.</L>
<L>'Tis certain th' Impostor is in <HI>Scotland</HI>;</L>
<L>Conceal'd and cherish'd by those needy Kerns;</L>
<L>While envious <HI>France</HI> prepares her Armaments</L>
<L>T' invade our Land, and aid the Vagrant's Claim.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stan.</SPEAKER>
<L>I trust, great Sir, that th' Alarm is false;</L>
<L>I cannot think that <HI>Scotland's</HI> King would e'er abet</L>
<L>An Impostor's Claim against your native Right;</L>
<L>Back'd and supported by your Subjects Voice,</L>
<L>Their Hands and Hearts; the best, the surest, Right</L>
<L>To <HI>England's</HI> Crown.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>That Right be ever mine.</L>
<L>My firmest Bulwark, against foreign Threats,</L>
<L>Shall ever be my Subjects Love; secure</L>
<L>In that, <HI>England's</HI> King, and this Sea-girt Isle,</L>
<L>May defy the warring World. But, <HI>Stanley,</HI></L>
<L>Are our Fleets in Readiness to scower</L>
<L>The dastard <HI>French?</HI> to sink and burn their hostile</L>
<L>Transports, should they dare look forth?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stan.</SPEAKER>
<L>They are, my Leige.</L>
<L>Proudly they ride, and plow the angry Main,</L>
<L>As if they rul'd that boist'rous Element,</L>
<L>And gave old Neptune Laws in his own Dominions.</L>
<L>While your faithful Troops,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="27"/>(Th' Remains of <HI>Bosworth's</HI> memorable Field,</L>
<L>Who fought so bravely 'gainst the Tyrant <HI>Richard)</HI></L>
<L>Headed by gallant <HI>Buckingham,</HI> are march'd</L>
<L>With eager Hearts to <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Suffex</HI>; and vow</L>
<L>To shed their warmest Blood 'gainst th' invading Foe,</L>
<L>Who treads a Step on <HI>England's</HI> Ground.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, ay, 'tis like an <HI>English</HI> Soldier's Vow;</L>
<L>It breathes forth Mettle, and native Courage,</L>
<L>Such, as <HI>fifth Harry</HI> felt, at th' deathful Scene</L>
<L>Of bloody <HI>Agincourt</HI>; when Gallic Prisoners</L>
<L>Trebled <HI>English</HI> Conquerors, and their mangled</L>
<L>Dead out-number'd both. Such again shall be</L>
<L>Their Lot;—Imprisonment or Death. Such their</L>
<L>Reward, who wound fair <HI>England's</HI> Peace.</L>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> OXFORD.</STAGE>
<L>Now, Lord <HI>Oxford,</HI> what says my loyal City?</L>
<L>Are the <HI>Londoners</HI> assembled?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ox.</SPEAKER>
<L>They are, my Leige:</L>
<L>Their kindled Chiefs are gather'd in Guild-Hall;</L>
<L>With each a Spirit like the first <HI>Romans,</HI></L>
<L>When rowz'd at midnight by th' inspiring Cry</L>
<L>Of <HI>save your Liberty</HI>!—When first I waked</L>
<L>The Mayor, and told him the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI></L>
<L>Were making a Descent in <HI>Perkin</HI>'s Cause,</L>
<L>Th' abrupt Relation drove the warm Colour</L>
<L>From his manly Cheek; but the rich Stream soon</L>
<L>Rush'd back with treble Force—<HI>English</HI> Courage,</L>
<L>Rage, and fiery Indignation; which now,</L>
<L>Like spreading Flames, catch,—quick—from Man to Man,</L>
<L>And through your loyal City nought is heard</L>
<L>But 'to arms.—Death or Liberty.—and long</L>
<L>'Live the King.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well; I will deserve their kind Af∣fection,</L>
<L>And ever be the Guardian of their Rights.</L>
<L><HI>Dawbney,</HI> take care there be Dispatches sent</L>
<L>This Night, to the Lieutenants of our several Coun∣ties;</L>
<L>Bid them, without Delay, prepare their People;</L>
<L>Distribute Arms, and animate their Zeal;</L>
<L>Our self will lead them on to happy Victory,</L>
<L>Or hard fought Death, in <HI>England</HI>'s glorious cause.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ox.</SPEAKER>
<L>Doubt not, my Liege; your Subjects all united</L>
<L>As now with Hand and Heart they firmly are,</L>
<L>Can never fail of joyful Victory.</L>
<L>The needy, restless <HI>Scots,</HI> so oft chastis'd,</L>
<L>Again shall feel the Vengeance of our Arms,</L>
<L>And ever rue this rash Attempt. As for the</L>
<L><HI>French,</HI> I've often heard my Grandsire say,</L>
<L>That, in <HI>fifth Harry's</HI> Days, the beating them</L>
<L>Was but an <HI>Englishman</HI>'s Recreation:</L>
<L>It shall be so again, my gracious Leige,</L>
<L>We'll drive the gaudy Rogues back to <HI>Paris</HI> Gates;</L>
<L>There, like beaten Curs, let them lick their bruised Wounds,</L>
<L>Mend their broken Limbs; and instead of making</L>
<L>Kings,—let them make Courantos, and follow</L>
<L>Their dancing skipping Avocations.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well said, my valiant <HI>Oxford.</HI> We'll make 'em feel in us</L>
<L>An <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Fifth Harry</HI> joyn'd. Ha! <HI>Stanley,</HI></L>
<L>We once again shall have our Bodies clasp'd</L>
<L>In burnish'd blazing Steel, and together fight</L>
<L>Against audacious Usurpation.</L>

<L>May the Almighty's providential Hand</L>
<L>Direct your Sword, and guard your sacred Life;</L>

<L>Attend your righteous Cause; and bless once more</L>

<SPEAKER>York.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Taunt, my Lord, might have been better timed,</L>

<L>For know, Sir, tho' a Priest, I'm <HI>English</HI> born,</L>

<L>And shed my warmest Blood in its Defence.</L>

<L>Cousin of <HI>York,</HI> none doubts your Loyalty,</L>

<L>My Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI> means you well; and his</L>

<L>Since Majesty itself is sometimes made their Butt.</L>
<L>'Tis true, his Humour's singular and blun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</L>
<L>But his Heart is honest, which makes large amends</L>
<L>For the Tartness of his Wit. Come, come, we</L>
<L>All are Friends, nor have we Time for Jibe,</L>
<L>Or Anger now, but 'gainst our common Foes,</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scot</HI>; there let your Pray'rs, and Jests,</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Hunt. Cath. <HI>and Soldier.</HI></STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Ox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome my Volunteer, how now, what have we here another Pretender!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hunt.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ay, my Lord, a Pretender she is indeed;</L>
<L>But one who ne'er meant ill to <HI>England.</HI></L>
<L>It is my dear <HI>Katherine</HI>; whose Woes outraging</L>
<L>The Cure of Patience, flew to War, and this</L>
<L>Impostor Garment, as to the swiftest</L>
<L>Means of Death. In the Midst of Battle she</L>
<L>Was taken; and now kneels <HI>England's</HI> Pris'ner.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rise, fair <HI>Katherine</HI>; your Woes we oft have pity'd,</L>
<L>But we hope they now are ended. The Joy</L>
<L>Your Deliverance brings to <HI>Huntley's</HI> Heart,</L>
<L><PB N="95" REF="100"/>We share in; and that Joy shall be your Ransom.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hunt.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thanks to your Majesty!—but here is the Man,
<STAGE>takes the Soldier by the Hand.</STAGE></L>
<L>Whose Humanity and Courage add Lustre</L>
<L>To the Soldier,—Dignity to human Nature.</L>
<L>This is her Deliverer; fated by</L>
<L>Providence this Day to stand between my Child</L>
<L>And Death.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Or Memory plays me false,</L>
<L>Or thou art the Man, who this Day sav'd me</L>
<L>From the <HI>Highland</HI> Pole-Ax.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sold.</SPEAKER>
<P>So please your Majesty, I did see you sorely smote in the Battle, and down, and bleeding, that I must confess. And had a common Fellow-Soldier been in that Condition, I would have cover'd him from farther Harm if I could. But, when I saw my King in Danger, I would have lost a thousand Lives, but I would have brought him off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Honest Soul—Lord <HI>Oxford,</HI> let this Soldier</L>
<L>Constantly be near our Person. Let him</L>
<L>Command our Body-Guards,—our Battle-Axes,</L>
<L>As Earnest of what we farther intend him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou dear Deliverer of my Child, let me add my Acknowledgment to thy Worth. Receive this Ring, the bright Inheritance which hath descended thro' the House of <HI>Gordon</HI> for many Generations. Wear the precious Pledge, not as a Reward, but a Mark of endless Gratitude, from a tender Father, and a loving Friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Lord <HI>Huntley,</HI> we now will haste towards <HI>Scotland's</HI> Frontiers,</L>
<L>Where we will celebrate the happy Nuptials</L>
<L>Of royal <HI>James,</HI> and our Daughter <HI>Margaret.</HI></L>
<L>Joy shall revel thro' both our Realms, and every</L>
<L><PB N="96" REF="101"/>Subject's Heart shall abound with Happiness.</L>
<L><HI>York, Oxford, Huntley,</HI> and all my Fellow Soldiers,</L>
<L>Shall be crown'd with Wreaths of smiling Victory;</L>
<L>For they have fought this Day, like true <HI>Britons</HI>;</L>
<L>Such as great <HI>Caesar</HI> had to cope withal;</L>
<L>Whose unpolish'd Courage, not all the Art</L>
<L>And tutor'd Discipline of War—like <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>Cou'd conquer.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, my Liege, let but the Kings of this little Nook, all act their Parts as you do yours, and I'll engage the People will never fail in theirs; let them but give us our constitutional Freedom, and we in Return will give them our Hearts and Purses; and then my Life for it, they never fail of Victory, let who will attack them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord, your Remark is just; <HI>English</HI> Courage</L>
<L>Must be foster'd with <HI>English</HI> Liberty;</L>
<L>And the King's Power supported by the Peoples Hearts.</L>
<L>United thus, let King and Subject stand,</L>
<L>Shields to each other, Guardians of the Land;</L>
<L>Let Faction cease, Commerce and Freedom smile,</L>
<L>The World can't conquer then, this War-Proof Isle.</L>
