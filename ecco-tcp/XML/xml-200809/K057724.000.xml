<STAGE>Doctor Plunder <HI>and</HI> Roscius secundus <HI>discovered.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HAVE founded my piece upon two ideas;—the first, a custom among the Egyptians, who publicly tried the conduct of their great men after death, and then gave judgment on their me∣rit. Secondly, a custom of the Greeks and Ro∣mans, who pronounced orations over the bodies of their deceased heroes, or over their ashes when inurned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Roscius secundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear few in these days would pass the Egyp∣tian ordeal immaculate, or merit the Greek or Ro∣man oration. But I am surprized, Doctor Plunder, that you, who have suffered so severely for tra∣ducing Master Punch, while living, should now become his Panegyrist; particularly as his <HI>execu∣tors</HI> have no <HI>pecuniary</HI> demands upon you. But having shifted off this mortal coil, and be∣come defunct, like Zanga's revenge, I suppose your enmity expired with your foe. You war not with the dust;—a lion preys not upon carcases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master Roscius secundus, you have hit the right nail on the head. I hated Punch while liv∣ing; but now he is dead, I am determined to be one of his most zealous eulogists. Our dislike arose from that mutual antipathy which naturally exists, not only between dramatic authors, but every class of writers, whether coiners, cutters, clippers, or counterfeiters, of literature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Roscius secundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sentiments, Doctor, exactly coincide with mine. His failings all lie buried in the grave, and all his good comes rushing on my soul. Ne∣ver will I again mimic his peculiarities with buf∣foon drollery. But do you not think the plagia∣rism of our piece will meet the disapprobation of the audience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means: I have only stolen from Shake∣speare; and Poets set up a prescriptive right to purloin from him. I am convinced from experi∣ence, that Plagiarism meets as much success as Originality. The addition of a few <HI>songs</HI> to a Tragedy, makes an excellent <HI>Masque</HI>; and airs ju∣diciously introduced into a <HI>Cut Comedy,</HI> answers all the intents, and every end of an <HI>Original Opera.</HI> I know how to secure the approbation of the public by crook, or by <HI>Hooke.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Roscius secundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will say that for you, Doctor, you do not de∣scend to <HI>petty larceny</HI>; your robberies are open and bold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>I plead guilty to your arraignment; and the Prologue which you speak to this night's enter∣tainment, I have taken, partly from old Jack Dry∣den, and partly from Alic Pope. I am like Sir Roger de Coverley's chaplain, who always preach∣ed from printed sermons, when unable to com∣pose himself. In dull moods I make bold with the works of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roscius secundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you not think, Doctor, that the <HI>Monody</HI> is rather too highly elevated in the <HI>hyperbole?</HI> In praising your hero, you have made mere cyphers of every other puppet. Like a poet laureat, you
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
have centered every virtue, merit, and qualifica∣tion, in an individual; which is out-heroding Herod, and an insult upon common-sense and mo∣desty.
<STAGE>[Bell rings.]</STAGE>
But hark! the prompter's bell rings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor Plunder.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adieu! I will retire, and write a few puffs for the newspapers: I have precedent for puffing my Monody in the public prints.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roscius secundus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in your puffs be sure to remember me, as I have not leisure to puff myself. I assure you, Doctor, puffing is often a means of procuring a good engagement; and if you give a critique upon this piece before it is printed, I expect to shine forth in the Critical Review; or, if it be published, to have my person delineated by Ro∣berts, and stuck in the window of Bell's Circu∣lating Library.</P>

<P>Alas, poor PUNCH! I knew him well, Melpo∣mene.
