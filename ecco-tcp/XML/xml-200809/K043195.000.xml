<P>A <HI>PLAY,</HI> IN FIVE ACTS.</P>
<P>AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, HAY-MARKET.</P>
<P>FOUNDED ON THE ROBBERS OF SCHILLER.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN an avowed alteration of THE ROBBERS of SCHILLER, it may surprize and disappoint many admirers of that highly celebrated work to find so much of the original dis∣placed for the introduction of new matter. I therefore feel it necessary to state my mo∣tives for having rather founded a Play on SCHILLER'S than merely adapted THE ROB∣BERS for representation.</P>
<P>Captivated by its beauties, I had no other plan when I first undertook to prepare the work for the Stage, than to make curtail∣ments, and such variations as most Dramas require that are not native productions. When completed agreeably to this design, its performance was prohibited by the li∣censer. I was unable at the time to account for this interdict, having carefully expunged all sentiments that appeared to war against establishments and good order. I am aware of an objection which has been made to CHARLES DE MOOR, the Hero of THE ROB∣BERS, importing that the grandeur of his character renders him more likely to excite
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
imitation than abhorrence; but this objection I have ever considered as unfounded. For surely to exhibit a man whose youthful irre∣gularities are the primary cause of his subse∣quent misery, and who, driven by desperation to a life of infamy, feels the most pungent an∣guish for his crimes, and expects that eternal torments will be his punishment, is so far from violating the purest system of ethics, that I am at a loss to conceive how a more forcible lesson of morality can be inculcated.</P>
<P>On a more dispassionate investigation of the Play, however I found much to justify the licenser's decision. Compunction for villainy seems the peculiar feature of CHARLES: the rest of the Robbers combine brutal insensibility of their enormities with the most heroic attachment to their leader. This junction of sublime virtue with con∣summate depravity, though it may be found in nature, should never be dragged into view:—the heroism dazzles the mind, and renders it blind to the atrocity.</P>
<P>Still unwilling wholly to abandon a fa∣vourite object, I determined on forming a Play, which should retain as much as pos∣sible of the original, with the omission of
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
all that could be deemed objectionable. This point was only to be accomplished by con∣verting the enterprize of the leading charac∣ter and his associates from an infamous into an honourable pursuit. The history of chivalry naturally suggested itself, as abound∣ing with instances of such warlike combina∣tions in the cause of religion and justice. Spain presented the most eligible scene of action, where those associations were so fre∣quent, that many of the most glorious vic∣tories over the Moors were effected solely by bands of Knight-adventurers, and the or∣ders of St. Jago, Calatrava, Alcantara, &amp;c. owe their origin to such laudable confe∣deracies.</P>
<P>By this change in the outline I have been enabled to submit a portion of SCHILLER'S ROBBERS to an English audience. The la∣bour that has attended this alteration must obviously have been considerable, as I was compelled to reconcile contradictions, to produce the same effects from totally oppo∣site causes: in short, in the words of my archetype, to make 'Angels of criminals.'</P>
<P>Some striking passages of the original, which might with consistency have been
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
preserved in this alteration, are omitted, be∣cause already adopted in recent productions. I mention this circumstance solely for my own vindication, that I may not be accused of a tasteless rejection of beauties. There are situations still retained which may remind the audience of what they have seen before: these I conceived to be of too much impor∣tance to the piece, and too forcible in their nature, to incur banishment for no fault but having been deemed worthy of imitation.</P>

<L>THOUGH fam'd CERVANTES, in the happiest vein</L>
<L>Of sportive satire, lash'd the gallant train</L>
<L>Who wander'd o'er the world to seek distress,</L>
<L>To succour Innocence, and Wrongs redress,</L>
<L>Yet those Enthusiasts held to ardent youth</L>
<L>The bright career of honour and of truth.</L>
<L>Hence, with the Sage, whom Virtue must deplore,</L>
<L>Virtue may grieve that CHIVALRY'S no more!</L>
<L>EXALTED SAGE! whose glowing pen so well</L>
<L>The fair desert of Chivalry could tell!</L>
<L>That prop of rank and sex—that gen'rous pride</L>
<L>Which, while it bent, obedience dignify'd—</L>
<L>That rev'rence of the heart that still, we find,</L>
<L>Serv'd with the spirit of a free-born mind—</L>
<L>That high disdain of all ignoble strife,</L>
<L><HI>A State's</HI> cheap guard—<HI>that</HI> 'unbought grace of life,"</L>
<L>'The nurse of manly sentiment'—<HI>the meed,</HI></L>
<L>As well as source, of each heroic deed—</L>
<L>That sensibility, with Honour found,</L>
<L>Which felt <HI>a stain</HI> as the severest <HI>wound;</HI></L>
<L>Which Valour's noble impulse could inspire,</L>
<L>Without the fierce extreme of savage ire;</L>

<L>That, void of grossness, Vice had less of harm!</L>
<L>Such was the wreath departed Genius bore</L>
<L>To deck a bold romantic race of yore;</L>
<L>And all who judge them fairly must confess</L>
<L>That e'en their faults were virtues in excess.—</L>
<L>But 'tis full time to speak about our play—</L>
<L>And hence our author bids me freely say,</L>
<L>That, since the German Stage can so delight,</L>
<L>He brings you something from that Stage to-night.</L>
<L>A work that foreign wits with zeal admire</L>
<L>For genuine pathos, dignity, and fire.</L>
<L>And should, through him, its vigour have declin'd,</L>
<L>At least its morals will be more refin'd;</L>
<L>The Heroes there all legal duties scorn,</L>

<P>BERTRAN, you have obliged me much, and I am not ungrateful.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have proofs of that, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODERIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have more anon, good Bertran. I know your character, and respect it. You are a man who feel an injury, and will resent it. You have not forgotten how much the Count Ladesma wronged you. Was it not enough to refuse you his ward, Eugenia, but he must add contempt to his rejection—scoff at your pre∣tensions—as if your small in heritance attached insamy to your name.</P>

<SPEAKER>BERTRAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I perish if ever I forget it!</P>

<PB REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>RODERIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Ferdinand was the cause of this: he has Eugenia's heart: 'twas for his sake his father rejected you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Curses on them both! I'll be revenged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODERIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Bertran, right. Revenge becomes a man. Be of good cheer. Thou still shalt have Eugenia. Come nearer, Bertran—take this purse: it should be heavier were I the master here. Then should you blaze in splendour, then should you receive Eugenia from my hand!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens, what joy springs from that thought! If Ferdinand were dead—then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODERIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, then we should need no stretch of policy to gain our wishes. Ferdinand dead, I am the absolute heir of my step-father, Count Lades∣ma's wealth and power. That was determined on my mother's union with him. Each by a former marriage having a son, the compact was, that on the failure of more issue, Ferdinand and myself were mutual heirs. A contract well stipulated by my prudent mother; as my in he∣ritance is not a twentieth part of the rich lord∣ships of Ladesma.</P>

<P>From my son Ferdinand?</P>

<P>No, Sir. It appears the hand of your cor∣respondent, Don Veremond.</P>

<P>Consider, Sir, the intelligence you have of late received has been afflicting, very afflicting, to a fond father: I am therefore alarmed for your health's sake—I beg your pardon—but let me entreat you to hear its contents when you may be better able to bear ill tidings.</P>

<P>Roderic!—from you I experience all the ten∣derness the best of sons could shew me—while my own offspring—Ah dear Roderic! you have compassion on my grey head: you wish to spare me; but read the letter—let me know the worst.</P>

<P>I shall ever hold it my first duty to obey you—in this instance, a melancholy duty—but still, let us hope that this brings the glad tidings of amendment. Let us hope it, Sir▪ <STAGE>[Reads.</STAGE></P>
<P>"Your son has filled up the measure of his shame. His dissolute conduct, with the report of which I have hitherto had the melancholy office of wounding your feelings, wears the semblance of purity when compared to his last act of infamy. His Sovereign—so gracious to him—who had loaded him with honours too mighty for his years, even had they been merited by his services—his Sovereign he deserted, and drew his sword on the part of rebellion."</P>

<P>Oh that I could give you comfort!</P>

<P>My comfort lies only in the grave. Yet, for thy kindness, Roderic, let me not be ungrate∣ful. Heaven, that has ordained these tears to flow for the crimes of my son, has sent me a son in thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODERIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh my father! (for father you have have ever been to me) let me wipe those tears away. I would sacrifice my life to prolong thy days. <Q>No tie of nature can be more strong, more sacred, than the bond of duty and affection by which I am devoted to thee.</Q></P>

Now, then, in the shade of my paternal woods, and in the arms of my dear be∣trothed Eugenia, I court the highest gift of Heaven—domestic happiness.</P>

<SPEAKER>GARCIAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Ferdinand, have you no dread of disap∣pointment? Methinks your father's conduct has been strange. He has but ill supplied you with the means to keep the state your rank de∣mands; and had not your own high merits drawn on you the regard and favours of your Sovereign, you could but scantily have borne yourself as the heir of an illustrious house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FERDINAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>That still has filled me with astonishment: since my absence from my father, he seems not only to have lost his former fondness for me, but almost to have forgotten that I am his son. Sup∣plies have been assigned me with a niggard hand, and the few letters I have received in answer to my warm expressions of respect and love, have been filled with sour remonstrances I do not merit▪ and frozen admonitions which I hope I need not.</P>

<P>Unfortunate Ferdinand, your loyalty has ruined you in your father's regard. The emissaries of Don Juan de Lara and Don Ema∣nuel have so completely influenced his feeble mind, that he is inflamed against you with the most unnatural resentment, for the zeal you have testified in the cause of your Sovereign against those powerful rebels. He commands me to tell you that he sends you his malediction, and that you have nothing to expect from him but vengeance. These are his very words. I grieve to add, that what you will deem the bit∣terest revenge is already effected. Eugenia, your beloved betrothed Eugenia, has been forced by him into the arms of one of the rebel adhe∣rents, and borne away by this husband ravisher I know not whither. From my soul I pity you!</P>

<P>Not so, my friend. He is the instrument of your glory. He snatches you from dishonour∣able inactivity, and impels you to the course of heroism.

<P>Guzman, I thank thee. Yes, the wrongs and miseries of Spain shall rouse me from re∣membrance of my own. My poor Eugenia! one tear to thy loss and thy distress, and now I am all my country's. Come, fellow warriors, hasten to take the sacred vows of chivalry; and when its holy badge adorns your bosoms, the Infidels shall prove we wear the ensigns of Re∣ligion's soldiers, not for vain ornament nor empty form; but as the zealous active ministers of Heaven. Be it our glorious duty to redeem our altars from unbelieving impious violators; to release the groaning captive from the gloomy dungeon where he lies, body and mind in

shackles; forced even to suppress the prayer he would offer to his God; and all his torments ag∣gravated by hearing hourly blasphemies against the Being he adores.

Where'er we meet him, he who has wronged the virtuous is our foe: and if he dare to mock religion by the name of Chris∣tian, while his deeds defy its sacred laws, he is worse than Infidel.

<P>I HAVE lost all patience. An old man's existence is an eternity. If one could find a new avenue for death's entrance into the sort of life, by wounding the soul to kill the body, ha! could that be effected? But what horrible emotion would have force at once to break the heart∣strings? Rage? No! That hungry wolf sur∣feits himself and regorges his meal. Grief? That's a worm that lingers in the flesh, and mines his way too slowly! Fear? No: Hope blunts his dart, and will not let him strike his prey! <STAGE>(Musing)</STAGE> I have it—Terror is the word! Reason, religion, hope, all must retreat before this giant fiend—and then—should he even bear the shock, there is more behind. Ye blissful years o'erpast, display your charms to memory's fond retrospect, and poison with your sweets the present hour! Ye scenes of fu∣ture bliss, combine to wound; shew him the joys of paradise before him, and hold the daz∣zling mirror out to hope, but cheat his feeble grasp!

<P>Bertran, we have done much, but still have much to accomplish. The old man's fondness for his son may yet defeat my purposes; and the girl too—Eugenia I mean—pursues him in∣cessantly with her tears and reproaches. He'll soon be sending in quest of him; and if he be found, good night to both of us. Then shall I who would raise you to honour, and load you with riches, be myself a despised beggar.</P>

<P>What splendour!—what lavish waste of riches! Here in his gaudy palace and his groves rivalling e'en his Prophet's paradise; here the luxurious delegated despot, immersed in plea∣sure, and inflamed with pride, mistakes the purpose of his exaltation, and feels as all were for his use, not he for the good of all. The cries of wretchedness against oppression disturb the pleasures of the soft voluptuary, and are forbid to wound his ears. Hence the mighty fearless oppress the weak, and he himself, placed to be guardian of the poor, grasps at their humble pittance to swell his luxury; and tho' his pro∣vince is to check oppression, becomes the worst oppressor.</P>

<P>No, Guzman! Slaves who have burst their bonds, and seized on power, prove the worst of tyrants. And in the preference of

wretchedness, he would be wise who rather chose to be enrolled the slave of the most lordly ruler of the East, than bear the mockery of a freeman's name where slaves are become rulers. No! there alone is happinesss where Law is supreme, not Will. Will uncontrolled, even if prone to goodness, is clogged with Nature's passions and infirmities; Law speaks the dictates of unclouded Reason; and there only Justice dwells, where those who deal the law are sub∣ject to the law.</P>
