<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it is the fate of dramatic works to undergo a much more severe scrutiny than any other of the efforts of the mind; authors, in this predicament, are justifiable in taking every opportunity of speaking in their own behalf, and the egotism should be, and is, by the candid, readily forgiven them. The applauses bestowed upon DUPLICITY, in the Theatre, have equalled my fondest hopes; and self-love itself cannot accuse the auditors of ingratitude, or want of penetration. But though there are scenes happy enough to have given universal satisfaction, there are others that have been called vulgarities, damned stuff, and by other concise and summary epithets, which men accustomed to decide without deigning to reason, have invented and appro∣priated to their own proper use. I do not mean to affirm there is no truth in these re∣marks: I am, perhaps, the person least qua∣lified of any to pronounce, with safety, on the merits or demerits of the work. Fathers, who are the most free from prejudice, cannot see
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>those defects in their offspring, which are obvious to others. In the rapidity of compo∣sition, blemishes are suffered to escape, through a laudable attention to things of greater im∣portance; and, like an ugly face, presently become too familiar to be disgusting. It is, for this reason, dangerous to commit any thing to paper, which the judgment, at the first perception, condemns. A work of any consequence is read and reconsidered so re∣peatedly, that the ideas at last lose both novelty and force, and the writer is disgusted to find those things, which, when first con∣ceived, gave him so much pleasure, become vapid, and assume the appearance of common place. For these reasons, I say, it would be arrogant in me to speak decidedly; I can only alledge what were my original motives for writing as I have done.</P>
<P>The English Comic Drama has long been renowned for humour; and when, about fourteen years ago, the French <HI>Comédie Lar∣moyante,</HI> or, as we call it, Sentimental Comedy, was introduced, the complaint was, that we had lost all the spirit of our old writers, and were dwindled into mere trans∣lators. The town was in this temper when Dr. Goldsinith's Comedy of SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER was produced, in which, humour, alone, seems to be the chief intention of the Author, and which gave a fatal blow to mere sentimental dialogue. The success of this
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>piece rouzed later writers from the soft slum∣bers of the heart, and wit and humour be∣came commodities in great request. The road to fame, though difficult, was obvious; and it would have been unpardonable for a young traveller, at his first out-set, so far to have mistaken, as not to have attempted it. The difficulties and dangers have increased, how∣ever, in a vast proportion. I need only men∣tion the SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL; and every discerning critic will immediately recollect how, and why.</P>
<P>In the Comedy of DUPLICITY, the 'squire and his sister are characters that, in their own nature, cannot admit of delicate strokes; and, if I have erred, it is not, I believe, so much in the colouring, as in the choice of my subject. An Author in his first attempt, is seldom impressed with that awe for the Public which is requisite, but ventures many things, that, perhaps, have their excellencies in reading, but that appear rude, abrupt, or indelicate, when pronounced before a large assembly. Were the humour of Smollet, which never fails to excite laughter in the closet, spoken upon the stage, it would fre∣quently excite universal disgust. Characters of broad humour are become peculiarly ha∣zardous, because they are become far less fre∣quent. A sense of propriety spreads in pro∣portion as people read, and reading is an infallible consequence of riches. This pro∣duced
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>duces delicate sensations in those who have acquired such a strict sense of propriety, and they are offended when they see things repre∣sented on the stage which, they suppose, do not exist in real life; though there are a thousand living characters, a thousand incidents at which, if exhibited, an audience would revolt, merely on the score of improbability.</P>
<P>Whatever the execution may have been, the intention of this Comedy is of a far nobler nature than the mere incitement of risibility: the vice it pretends to correct is become truly enormous; and I would rather have the merit of driving one man from the gaming-table, than of making a whole theatre merry.</P>
<P>I have, likewise, been accused by some of imitation, and want of originality. It is said, I have stolen an incident from one piece, and a character from another, and that it is evi∣dently the play of a player. This last re∣mark, I believe, would never have been made, had I not been known to be a player. The accusations, which have the greatest appear∣ance of truth, are, that LE DISSIPATEUR of Monsieur Destouches, and the Tragedy of THE GAMESTER, have furnished the great outlines of the plot. To these I answer, that, were it so, I would make no scruple of avowing it, because I should not think my∣self degraded by the avowal; but I declare the plot was finished, and almost the comedy,
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>before I ever read LE DISSIPATEUR: and if I have pillaged the GAMESTER, it was from latent ideas, of which I am unconscious; for I have neither read, nor seen the GAMES∣TER for many years. A parallel circumstance to that of Sir Harry losing his sister's fortune, is found, I am told, in the GAMESTER; but this incident was added to DUPLICITY since it was first written, by the advice of a friend, to give a strength to the denoument. But there is a story told in the life of Beau Nash, which, had these critics known, would have immediately pointed out the place whence, they might have sworn, without the least suspicion of perjury, I had stolen my plot; and yet, had they sworn, they would have been perjured, for I never read that story till I had written my Play, and then, I confess, I was amazed at the similarity.</P>
<P>However, I repeat, had I taken my plot from any play or story, I should have made no scruple to confess it, because I think it no disgrace. The first of all poets invented none of his plots; I shall never be the second, and yet I affirm I did invent mine; that is, as far as I myself am conscious. The elegant Bishop Hurd, in his discourse on Poetical Imitation, has the following remark, among many others, which is applicable to the pre∣sent occasion: <Q>The objects of imitation, like the materials of human knowledge, are a common stock which experience
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>furnishes to all men; and it is in the ope∣rations of the mind upon them that the glory of poetry, as of science, consists. Here the genius of the poet hath room to shew itself, and from hence, alone, is the praise of originality to be ascertained.</Q></P>
<P>The Comedy is now committed to the im∣partial judgment of the true critic; and I have only to wish, it may receive as favourable a sentence from him, as it has already expe∣rienced from the voice of an indulgent Public.</P>

<L>RASH was the wight, who first, in hollow'd tree,</L>
<L>Daring, resolv'd to tempt the treach'rous sea!</L>
<L>Hungry the wretch, who, forth from shelly cloister,</L>
<L>First drew and swallowed down—a living oyster!</L>
<L>But far more rash and daring is THAT wight,</L>
<L>Who, in this polish'd age, attempts to write:</L>
<L>Long may his hunger last, who pines for fame,</L>
<L>Who seeks that hard-earn'd morsel, call'd—A NAME!</L>
<L>A morsel clos'd within a scaly guard</L>
<L>Of critic shells, obdurate, rough, and hard!</L>
<L>Well fare the bard, whose fortitude, sedate,</L>
<L>Stands, unappall'd, before impending fate;</L>
<L>When cat-call-pipers, groaners, whistlers, grinners,</L>
<L>Assembled, sit to judge of SCRIBBLING SINNERS!</L>
<L>What mortal mind can keep its terrors under</L>
<L>When gods sit arm'd, with awful—wooden thunder?</L>
<L>What heart, so brave, can check its palpitation,</L>
<L>Before, the grave dispensers of damnation:</L>
<L>Or who, in danger of such mighty evil,</L>
<L>Would not turn Indian, and adore the devil?</L>
<STAGE>[Bows.</STAGE>
<L>Various have been the stratagems and wiles,</L>
<L>Display'd in prologues, to obtain your smiles.</L>
<L>Some make the stage an inn; and hope to bribe,</L>
<L>With curious feast, the turtle-eating tribe:</L>
<L>Make vain attempts, in metaphor, to treat,</L>
<L>But metaphor is unsubstantial meat.</L>
<L>So bold harpooners, if their oars should fail,</L>
<L>Toss out an empty tub, to amuse the whale.</L>
<L>Others more mean, implore, in whining style,</L>
<L>That tender pity may your hearts beguile;</L>
<L>Bespeak applause, by way of deprecation,</L>
<L>And think that fame is charity's donation.</L>
<L>So dastard curs provoke the mastiff's bite,</L>
<L>Then fawn and cringe to shun th' unequal fight.</L>
<L>Our author hopes, by honest means, to gain</L>
<L>Plaudits which merit never ask'd in vain:</L>
<L>Should such biest claim be his, he need not fear,</L>
<L>He knows your candour;—Party dwells not here!</L>
<L>Patient to your decision he'll submit,</L>
<L>Nor wish to bribe the arbiters of wit.</L>

<P>WELL, my dear Melissa, you will be a happy woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt of it. The attention which Mr. Osborne has shewn me, was not that of a man eager to gain the affection of his mis∣tress by humouring her caprices, praising her beauty, and flattering her follies. He is obliging and well-bred, but sincere; yet his disapprobation is delivered with a delicacy that makes it more agreeable than some people's compliments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>If time, instead of mellowing the strokes, should wear away this smooth varnish and dis∣cover a harsh outline, should you not be offended at the severity of his manner, think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, dear Clara, there is no danger; for if there be one man on earth more capable of making a woman happy than another it is Mr. Osborne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be heresy in you, my dear, to hold any other opinion; and I have no doubt but you will continue orthodox after marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—I shall certainly die in that faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your brother, Sir Harry, I believe, is of your religion too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely—The friendship of Mr. Os∣borne and my brother is as sincere as the com∣mencement of it was remarkable—Have you ever heard their story?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never. You know my acquaintance with your family is but just begun; but, I hope, you will not think them words of course when I assure you that, short as it is, I feel myself in∣terested in its happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I am sure you are sincere—I know it by sympathy—Well then, I'll tell you—Harry and Osborne happened to be both abroad at the same time. As my brother was going to Italy, and passing through the mountainous part of Sa∣voy, he came to a hollow way, among the rocks, surrounded by trees and caverns. All on a sud∣den, at a turning in the road, he beheld Osborne, and his servants, attacked by six banditti, and ready to sink under their wounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was Sir Harry alone?</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>alarmed.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had his governor, two servants, and the postillion—My brother instantly leaped from his carriage, snatched up his sword and pistols, andflew to the place of action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declare you terrify me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was not seen by the combatants, and took care to advance so near, before he
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>fired, that he could not fail to do execution—He laid two of the banditti dead; and their com∣panions, who had discharged their fire-arms, and beheld Sir Harry's people running to the attack and levelling their pieces, fled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you for that, my dear—you have given me breath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The intrepidity with which Sir Harry saw Osborne defend himself, and the fortitude he discovered when he was informed, as it was at first believed, that his wounds were mortal, at∣tached my brother so powerfully to him, that he resolved not to leave him in the hands of strangers, but anxiously waited while he was under cure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a noble generosity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was; and Osborne was so sensible of it that, though he was going the other way, he would return with Sir Harry into Italy; and their friendship has continued ever since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it not strange, my dear, that he cannot detach his friend, Sir Harry, from the GAMING-TABLE?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother is insatuated—It is his greatest, almost his only weakness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the report is, that Mr. Osborne takes advantage of this weakness; that, while he publicly satirizes the practice, he privately bene∣fits by his superior address; and, in fact, has half ruined Sir Harry HIMSELF.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesterday—But how came you to quit Bath so suddenly, Gentlemen? I understood you intended to stay another week, and you were gone before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Osborne, Madam, was <HI>horri∣blement ennuyé</HI>—dull as an alderman at church, or a fat lap-dog after dinner—thinking on mar∣riage, Melissa, and other momentous matters; and so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Sir Harry, this is mighty ingenious; but you were, at least, as willing to be gone as myself—The truth, Madam, is, my MODEST friend, here, heard YOU were to set off in a day or two; and, from that moment, was con∣tinually giving hints, and asking me how I, as a lover, could exist so long without a sight of my mistress; and, in short, began, all at once, to talk so sympathetically about absence and ages, that I, who had made the excursion purely to ob∣lige him, was, I acknowledge, exceedingly happy to find I could oblige him by returning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you to this, Sir Harry?—But, I know your politeness—you will confess it all to be true, and begin to say civil things upon the subject, that will only put me to the trouble of blushing and curtsying; so we'll sup∣pose them all if you please—But come, tell me—what's the news of the day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>News! Oh, that's true—Look here, my dear!—I thought I had something to tell you— <STAGE>(<HI>reads a paragraph in a newspaper</HI>)</STAGE>—<Q>We hear, from very good authority, that a hymeneal treaty is concluded between a certain beauti∣ful ward, not a mile from St. James's Square, and her old guardian; and that the lady is expected in town from Bath, every hour, to sign and seal.</Q></P>

<P>What say you to this, Madam?</P>

<P>Say! I protest I don't know what to say!—except that these NEWSMAKERS are a very pleasant, ingenious kind of people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a'n't you angry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Angry! no indeed. I am sure I am very much obliged to them, for thinking of me—I shall be so stared at—I'll go into public con∣tinually, and my guardian shall go with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is there any foundation for this report, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I am sure I can't tell: there may be, for aught I know—I have suspected the mat∣ter a great while, you must know, by my guardian's simpering and squeézing my hand so often—then, he is continually talking about METHUSE∣LAH, and the ANTEDILUVIANS, and making sys∣tems to convince me how much stronger, and longer lived, some men are than others—He read, the other day, in the ANNUAL REGISTER, of a man, at INVERNESS, who lived to the age of one hundred and seventeen; and he has been talk∣ing, ever since, of purchasing a country seat in the HIGHLANDS.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You are very happy in a lover, Ma∣dam.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exceedingly—quite proud of my con∣quest—There is no such great miracle in bring∣ing a young fellow, whose passions are all afloat, to die at ones feet—The thing's so natural that one does it every day—But to thaw the icy blood
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>of a grave old gentleman, to see him simper, sigh, dance minuets, and look ridiculous for one—Oh! there is, positively, no flattery equal to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He will make your winter evenings in the HIGHLANDS quite entertaining, with re∣lating the wild pranks he committed, and the deeds of prowess he was guilty of in his youth—then you will be so delighted with listening to his raptures, and tasting his panada, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes—yes, yes—ha, ha—I—I think I see him now, with his venerable bald head, his shrivelled face, and his little pug nose, that looks as red and as bright as the best Dutch sealing-wax, rising from his chair, by the help of his crutch-headed stick, to breathe forth vows of love and everlasting fidelity—Ha, ha, ha.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's whimsical enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—Oh, now you talk of whimsical, I was accosted by an old gentleman, the night before I left Bath, in the rooms, who was the drollest being, and had the most agreeable kind of whimsicallity about him, I ever met with—I thought he would have made love to me—swore I was an angel, and said a thousand civil things—quite galant.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you remember, Sir Harry, a gawky girl, that stalked round the rooms, and stared pro∣digiously—she that was stuck to the side of a bob∣wig'd country 'squire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh!—what the—the wench with her arms dangling, her chin projecting, and her mouth open—dressed in the—red ribband, taw∣dry stile; and that looked as if she were afraid of being lost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—or as if she durst not trust her∣self alone, out of her own parish, lest somebody should catch her, put her in a sack, and send her for a present to the king of the Cannibals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same—that is the accomplished Miss Turnbull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the easy, well-bred, drawing∣room lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,—well— <STAGE>(<HI>with an affected gravity</HI>)</STAGE>—and I don't doubt but she would make a sort of a—a—a very good wife—Understands the arts of brewing, baking, pick∣ling of pork, curing of hung beef, darning of stockings, and other branches of housewifery, in perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no doubt—Is perfectly skilled too in the science of feeding the pigs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—and will make her own and her husband's linen, and do all the needle-work and quilting at home—believes in ghosts, and has got the wandering Prince of Troy, the Babes in the Wood, and the entertaining dialogue of Death and the Lady, by heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such, and so numerous, are the wife∣like properties of MISS BARBARA TURNBULL.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>TURNBULL, too!—Well, that is such a delightful name, for a country lady—so pastoral!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>The father was one of the greatest graziers in the west of England; and was so in∣tent on getting money, that he bred his children in the most stupid ignorance—He is lately dead, and the son has commenced gentleman and 'squire, by virtue of the father's industry, and a pack of fox-hounds; and though he has scarce knowledge enough of articulate sounds to hold a dialogue with his own geese, yet does he esteem himself a devilish shrewd fellow, and a wit—His conversation is vociferous, and patched up of pro∣verbs, and out-of-the-way sayings, which he strings together without order or connection; and utters, upon all occasions, and in all companies, without respect to time, place, or person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, Sir Harry, I shall have to wish you joy soon, I suppose—but I must be gone—fifty visits to make this morning—time flies
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>—butagreeable company, and all that, you know—Oh, Sir Harry, you mean to attend the spring meetings this year, at Newmarket—I am told you understand the turf—I think of sending a venture of five hundred by somebody—But I shall see you often enough before then—Adieu.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what do you think of this lady, Osborne?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think her a very amiable, accom∣plished lady; and one that, under an assumed levity, observes and understands every thing about her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am entirely of your opinion—If I may judge from an acquaintance of such short date, she is the first woman in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except one, Sir Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You, Osborne, may make excep∣tions, if you please—I am not so captious—She has beauty without vanity, virtue without pru∣dery, fashion without affectation, wit without malice, gaiety without coquetry, humour—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold—stop to breathe—How was it? Vinegar without acid, fire without heat, light without shade, motion without matter, and a likeness without a feature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>"Spite—by the Gods!—proud spite and burning envy."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did you observe her Newmarket hint, Sir Harry; and the concealed significance with which it was delivered?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which being faithfully done into English, bears this interpretation:—"I Clara Forrester, a beautiful, elegant, sensible girl,
<PB N="11" REF="21"/>with a fine fortune, should like to take you, Harry Portland, with youth, spirit, and certain et ceteras, but"—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>"But that I am afraid of indulging a partiality for any man, who is so intolerably ad∣dicted to gaming"—Is not that the conclusion of your speech?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fie! No, no, gaming!—That man has a body without a soul, that never felt an inclination to gaming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so; but that man has the greatest soul, who can best resist that inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw!—;Gaming is the essence of fashion, and one of your strongest recommenda∣tions—Clara is a girl of spirit, and what girl that comes under that description, would ever place her affections on a sneaking, sober, pru∣dent fellow—a mechanical scoundrel, that knows the day of the month, sips tea, keeps a pew in the parish church, writes memorandums, and goes to bed at eleven o'clock—Poh! absurd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Curse me, Osborne, if I know what to make of you—You are a riddle that I cannot expound. You have such an aukward way of praising gaming, that it always has the appear∣ance of satire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Satire! how so? Do you think I'd satirize myself? Who sports more freely than I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why there's the mystery!—You are as eager, to the full, as I am—If I set an hun∣dred on a back hand, you offer a thousand; nay, had I the fortune of a Nabob, and were to stake it all, you would be the first man to cry cover'd, and be damned mad if any one wanted to go a guinea—Not because you have not generosity, but in the true and inveterate spirit of gaming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly—Gaming!—why gaming is the best sal volatile for the spleen—It rouzes the spirits, agitates the blood, quickens the pulse, and puts the whole nervous system in a continual vibration—No man ever yet died of an apoplexy, that loved a box and dice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But they have died as suddenly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! ay, ay, but that's a fashionable disease, an influenza; that's to make your exit with eclat; that's to go out of the world with a good report.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True—true—and indeed, as to a few years, more or less, that is, in reality, a mighty insignificant circumstance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bagatelle!—Let us live while we do live, and die when we can't live any longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's my comfort—that's my com∣fort—Yes—yes—a pistol!—a pistol is a very cer∣tain remedy for the cholic—Nobody but a pi∣tiful scoundrel would go sighing, and whining, and teizing other people with his griefs and com∣plaints.—When a man is weary, what should he do but go to sleep?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure—Life itself is but a dream—'Tis only sleeping a little sounder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! live to be pitied!—Ha, ha—A decayed gentleman! No, no, no—A wi∣thered branch—a firelock without a flint—And yet—heigho!—this Clara—damn it—its provok∣ing—Youth—beauty—affability—she's a bewitch∣ing girl!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A lovely girl!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—enough so to make any man, that might hope to be in her favour, in love with life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Any man, any man—but me—no, no—Undone—undone—undone—</P>

<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but, seriously, since you have such bad success, why don't you renounce play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Tis too late—I have sunk eighty thousand—My resources almost all exhausted, my estates all mortgaged to Jews and scoundrels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>All!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All; except the estate in Kent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if you cannot content your∣self with your present loss, your best way will be to make another vigorous push.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's exactly what I am determined to do; and, unless the devil possesses the dice, I think I may expect, without a miracle, that for∣tune should change hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would think so, indeed—Will you dine then at my house? There will be the Chevalier, the Baron, and the usual set—They have engaged to dine with me—They are spirited fellows, and will play for any sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know—Suspicion is a curst meanness; and yet, I cannot help having my doubts of some among that company—Nay, had you not so often assured me you were perfectly acquainted with them all—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I tell you again and again, so I am—I will be answerable for their conduct, and that's more than I would say for any other set of gamblers upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well—I'll meet you there.</P>

</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit Osborne.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no,—No light heart for me—I am sunk—degraded in my own opinion—Gaming alters our very nature—Osborne used to hate it—he was then an open-hearted, generous
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>fellow—he now appears to have contracted an in∣satiable love for money, and a violent desire to win—he cares not of whom—of me as soon as another—Were I in his situation, and he in mine, I think I should find an aversion to increase his distress—he knows mine, yet has no such aversion—Perhaps he thinks my ruin certain, and that he may as well profit by it as another—I know him to have the most refined and strictest sense of honour—I have lost most of my money to him, and in his company, and therefore have not been duped out of it.—That is some comfort, however.</P>

<P>Lackaday, Sir, yes!—And a very large supply too—He wants 5000<HI>l.</HI> immediately—Lackaday!

<P>What said he?</P>

<P>Lackaday—not much—seemed cha∣grined—said it must have an end, one way or ano∣ther, soon; and demanded, whether I could, or could not, raise the money—Lackaday—I told him, I was no longer master of ways and means; and he said, then he must positively employ another prime minister, for supplies he must have.</P>

<P>Why did you tell him that? Go to him, inform him you have met with a tender-hearted

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Calipash! Thou art sweeter, ten∣derer, more delicate, delightful and delicious, than all the calipash and callipee in the universe—A gem—a jewel—that all the Sophy's, Sultans, Grand Signiors and Great Moguls, of the whole earth, have not riches enough to purchase.</P>

<P>I have no friends—that is, no rela∣tions—no children—have made a great fortune, by care, and labour, and anxiety, and debarring my∣self the pleasures, and comforts of life, in my youth—And why should not I sit down and enjoy it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, and why don't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because men are fools, and laugh they don't know why—I hate ridicule—Nobody loves to be thought ridiculous—The world has got false notions—A man of fifty is called old, and must not be in love, for fear of being pointed at—Whereas some men are older at thirty, than others at threescore.</P>

<P>What's your story about me?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>

<P>But instead of meditating, like a pious Christian, on the four last things, a crotchet takes him in the head, he buys a three-penny fiddle, scrapes a matrimonial jigg, claps a pair of horns upon his head, and curvets thro' the town,

<P>I beg your pardon, dear Osborne—I am to blame—nothing but the severity of my late losses can plead for me—I know you to be a noble-hearted, worthy fellow, and explanations, on such an accusation, are as much beneath you to give, as me to demand—forget my silly warmth, it is my weakness.</P>

<P>With the addition of Miss Turnbull's accomplishments, I most undoubtedly do, Sir.</P>

<P>Perfectly, Sir, and remember it with gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That remains to be proved, friend—Ever since your father's death, if I don't mis∣take, I have been tolerably busy, a little active,

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's a lie, I believe—However, Sir—among the rest of my cares, I was anxious to find a woman worthy of you—Nay, so solicitous was I about adjusting preliminaries, that tho' the gout had laid an embargo upon a parcel of my fingers and toes, I resolved to forego my own ease, and set sail immediately, that I might convoy you sase into the harbour of happiness.</P>

<P>Well, I have only a word or two more to say on the subject—I have been an enthu∣siastic old blockhead, 'tis true, and was fool enough to think all men had eyes; however, if you have not either the complaisance, the wit, or the love, to hit upon some expedient to make your peace with Miss Turnbull, I will never see, never know, never speak to you again. And now, Sir, you will act as your great wisdom shall direct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I am distressed to see you so intent upon this busines; I am exceeding∣ly unhappy, to do the least thing to incur your displeasure—at this moment especially—I have a thousand reasons to be disatisfied with myself, and am grieved to add your anger to the lift—I would do any thing, in my power, to preserve your friendship and affection; but this is too severe a task—I cannot totally forget common sense—I cannot entirely command so delicate a passion, as that of love—A little time will dis∣cover,
<PB N="60" REF="70"/>whether I am ever to think of love or happiness again!—Of this, however, I am cer∣tain—I never can possess either with Miss Turn∣bull—</P>

<P>Why true, as you say, friend Van: but that happens to be a blunder which I never did, nor ever could make. I should as soon take myself for a king, or you for a conjuror. I only mistook this lady to be Miss Turnbull, not Miss Turnbull to be this lady.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My grand object, the thing that, of all others, I have most at heart, is to see my ne∣phew, Sir Harry, happy—As for myself, I feel I am growing old apace, and am almost tired of the farce of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, Sir Hornet? I am sure you play your part excellently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no—I am rolling down hill apace, and as the first steep declivity may preci∣pitate me to the bottom, there are certain affairs I wish to see finished, one of which is the mar∣riage of Sir Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>So the person you asked concerning me, when I went out of the rooms, mistook the ques∣tion, and thought you meant Miss Turnbull?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So it appears, madam—And I was too much enraptured to stay to rectify mistakes—when I negotiated the affair with 'Squire Turnbull, I studiously avoided an interview with his supposed sister, for fear the business should wear a face of precipitate indelicacy.—And I thought if I could once bring you and Sir Harry together, I would leave the contingent possibilities to love, and the superior good qualities and penetration of the par∣ties,
<PB N="68" REF="78"/>which I, rationally enough, concluded could not fail to produce the desired effect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir Hornet, how did it happen that you did not enquire of me myself who I was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, madam, I had been so particular with you, and had spoken so freely on the subjects of love and matrimony, that I was afraid, if I made those kind of enquiries, you would mistake the matter, perhaps, and think I wanted to make love to you in my own proper person. Hey, young Van—</P>

<P>Dear brother, you are not so guilty as you suppose—it was a plot upon you; you were
<PB N="76" REF="86"/>led into it, to shew you what a losing gamester is capable of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hark you, Sir? <STAGE>(to Osborne)</STAGE> All the mortgages and deeds are there, you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>All, Sir—together with whatever mo∣ney else has, at any time, been won of him, since I have been concerned in this transaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All in that box?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>All.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Timid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm a happy old man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear uncle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone—Tol der rol— <STAGE>(Goes up to Osborne, takes his hand, and wipes his own eyes)</STAGE> Will you forgive me, Osborne? Will you? Will you forgive my boy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Takes Osborne's other hand)</STAGE>
<P>Osborne!—I cannot speak—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Osborne, I don't know how to tell you what I think—Esteem—admiration—veneration—are poor expressions to convey my feelings—I have been mistaken and to blame—I trembled for Sir Harry, I rashly condemned you, and wrote a letter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, was that letter your's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How much obliged am I to you, and to you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, I was to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Madam—Nobody was to blame—Angels are actuated by motives like your's, and if they never err, it is because they have com∣merce with angels only.—And now, dear Harry, suffer me to say one word—Let this transaction be a powerful, an everlasting memento to you.—Remember the blood that has been spilt in the moment of passion and distress, in consequence of indulging in this shocking vice—Remember
<PB N="77" REF="87"/>the distracted wife, and widow's curse, the orphans tears, the sting of desperation, and the red and impious hand of suicide; despise the folly that made the practice fashionable; oppose its destruc∣tive course, and for ever shun, for ever abominate, the detestable vice of gaming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Professions of resolution, from me, Osborne, come with an ill grace—I am ashamed of my folly—I despis'd, even while I practised it; but the punishment you have inslicted, has been so judicious, so severely generous, I think I can safely say, there is no probability of a re∣lapse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Harry, turn about—look at this lady—surely you have not forgot Miss Turnbull—have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Miss Turnbull, Sir, I shall never forget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what you have heard the re∣nowned history of my Bath adventure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what say you to—hey my cherub—you told me, you know, you had no aversion to the fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir Hornet, is that the part of a confidante?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, it is—for, as I take it, a confidante is but a kind of a go-between to bring the parties together—And here comes the blooming youth— <STAGE>(<HI>Enter Vandervelt</HI>)</STAGE> here comes Johannes de Temporibus to second the motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>To second what motion, Sir Hor∣net?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sri <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A hymeneal motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't tell—who are the candi∣dates?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="78" REF="88"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Harry Portland and Clara Forester.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, Sir Hornet, not so fast!—That lady is my ward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and may, if she pleases, be your wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay—I—I did not say so, Sir Hornet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I did, young Van—but hark you— <STAGE>(<HI>takes him aside</HI>)</STAGE> Resign all your silly pretensions peaceably, throw your worthies into the fire, and give up the lady to her lover; or you shall be held up, in terrorem, an object of ridicule, to frighten all the dangling, whining, old fools in christendom, who are turned of three∣score.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, speak in a lower key.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>May I be certain of your consent then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes—yes—heigho:—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam—this worthy old Gentleman, your guardian, most humbly im∣plores you would have pity upon Sir Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you say so, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! no—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vandervelt.</SPEAKER>
<P>N—not in those exact words, but something very like it, Turtle—heigho!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Melissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my dear Clara—Let me have the happiness to call you sister—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osborne.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me intercede, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw—here is every body interceding, but him that can intercede most to the purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Harry.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, dearest Clara—My fate is suspended on your lips, and I am so con∣scious of unworthiness, and so much affected by the fear of a severe sentence, that I have not power to plead for mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="79" REF="89"/>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—but you have a partial, tender-hearted judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Hornet.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—"and a wise young judge" too—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well!—I cannot dissemble. A generous heart, a noble mind, are seldom met and seldom merited. When happiness like this presents itself, to reject is not to deserve it.</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by MISS YOUNGE.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>INFORM me, you, at whom he seems to write,</L>
<L>Don't this man's insolence your spleen excite?</L>
<L>Give the beau-monde impertinent advice?</L>
<L>Proscribe VINGT UNE—prohibit box and dice!</L>
<L>Tell YOU of honour, infamy, undoing,</L>
<L>And—impudently preach you out of ruin?</L>
<L>Are cards and dice fit subjects for his fables?—</L>
<STAGE>(<HI>laughs</HI>)</STAGE>
<L>He'd better write a tragedy on E. O. tables?</L>
<L>And why, with so much rudeness and ill-nature,</L>
<L>'Gainst PRIVATE vice urge acrimonious satire,</L>
<L>Since legal lotteries flourish every year,</L>
<L>And peers and pedlars run the mad career</L>
<L>Of public ruin, in its full extent,</L>
<L>And beggars game—BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT!</L>
<L>Nay, once in seven years, in full perfection,</L>
<L>Is play'd a game more desp'rate, call'd, "ELECTION!"</L>
<L>When each grave senator the cause promotes,</L>
<L>And throws the main with—cogg'd and loaded votes;</L>
<L>When honour, conscience, justice, law, religion,</L>
<L>Are ev'ry one, by turns, the plunder'd pigeon!</L>
<L>But wherefore rail at games in any station?</L>
<L>Life is, itself, a game at calculation,</L>
<L>In which Dame Fortune gains but little thanks,</L>
<L>For each man swears HIS prizes are all blanks.</L>
<L>So when your am'rous lover draws for wife,</L>
<L>And wit and beauty link with him for life,</L>
<L>Tho' twice ten thousand vows of love were paid,</L>
<L>To gain the charming!—dear!—angelic maid!—</L>
<L>Tho' constancy and raptures were the theme!—</L>
<L>Let but possession chace the honey'd dream,</L>
<L>His bouncing passion bursts like bonfire squib,</L>
<L>And wit and beauty form—A CROOKED RIB!</L>
<L>The lordly husband takes a different tone,</L>
<L>When once sweet Miss becomes "bone of his bone!"</L>
<L>The tender epithet, the dying leer,</L>
<L>Are chang'd to—"Damme, Madam, can't you hear?"</L>
<L>For these, poor authors, who their pens employ</L>
<L>To write down pleasures which they can't enjoy,</L>
<L>You, against whom they aim their boldest strokes,</L>
<L>Have too much NONCHALANCE to mind their jokes;</L>
<L>You find them soporifics, quite composing,</L>
<L>For all the while they're preaching, you are dozing.</L>
<L>Our bard, who full of antiquated notions,</L>
<L>Intends to cure the world by scenic potions,</L>
<L>Gravely resolves to set the nation right,</L>
<L>If your applause should crown his hopes to night.</L>
