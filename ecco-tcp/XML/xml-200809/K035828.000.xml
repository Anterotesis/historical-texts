<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT. TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following trifle is as fully satisfied of the small claim it has to public atten∣tion, as the best <HI>critical anatomist</HI> in town could make him—but as the country managers procure copies of every piece play'd with success in London, that is not published, he is unwilling to have the number of his faults increased through the blunders and inaccuracies of an ig∣norant
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
short-hand writer. He there∣fore presents his little offspring to the reader as it came into the world; for though a <HI>parent</HI> may find no great beauty in a child, few, I fancy, are so <HI>unnatural</HI> as so stand by and see one knocked o'the head, or get a broken limb, without making some effort to prevent the accident.</P>

<P>SOPHIA, my dear, how do you like this tea?</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, Mr. Skylight, you will never get rid of your vulgar ideras, notwithstanding all the pains I take with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what right have you to give your daugh∣ter a higher name than plain Kate, Bridget, or Susan? Are'nt these, think you, good enough for a tradesman's wife, as she must be? If you don't keep a tighter rein with that girl Bridget, she'll resemble her betters in more respects than her name: ay, and if ever she gets a husband, will put him in the fashion as well as herself, or I'm out in my calculation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear, wasn't she baptiz'd Susannah Sophia Serina?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much against my will. She was call'd, Su∣sannah after her grandmother; and damme, if I, was a bishop, but I'd pluck the blockhead's cas∣sock

over his ears who tack'd the other two heathenish, nonsensical additions to it—But don't sit chatting nonsense all night over that slop— go to the shop, and see the customers ar'nt neglected—I expect a few panes knockt out in the beginning of the evening, and people don't care to let 'em stand all night without mending.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may look after the customers yourself; Sophy and I are engag'd this evening.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, sure, you hav'nt the impudence to leave the house of an illumination night? and the last I expect too, till we have news from the West Indies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SUSANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, indeed, papa, we are engag'd to a coach-party, to drive through all the streets, and see the windows; indeed we are, and can't polsitivey be off, if we would maintain any thing like character.</P>

<SPEAKER>SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and have that haycock upon your head set fire to by squibs and crackers? I tell you what, Mrs. Prate-most, you're in the high road to lose all characters; as for your part, Bridget, damn me! but I believe romances, hard-words and quality airs, have turn'd your head; you encourage your daughter to fly in her father's face.</P>

<P>Come, Sophy, we'll leave him to recover from his tantrums—[<HI>going.</HI>] You see, child, what you have to expect, if you marry a man who has no idera of the foster commotions, and whose heart is more indurate than the glass which he glazes.</P>

<SPEAKER>SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, off they go, to that puppy Quillet, the lawyer's clerk, and Abraham Skylight has seen the last of them 'till to-morrow morning <STAGE>[Sits down in a melancholy posture.]</STAGE> Why did I marry? Was it not as clear as plate-glass, that a prudent glazier cou'd never live in peace with a woman of

her confounded extravagant turbulent spirit? Is there one part of her marriage vow she has not broken? Yes, let me do her justice; her chastity; that I look, upon to be a whole pane yet; and I fancy, while her present head continues upon her shoulders, it is a pane few will think worth smashing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKYLIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that's a fine fellow for our trade; he's a magazine of patriotism; all I am afraid of, is, that as he has so much combustible stuff about him, he'll blow up one of these days, to the great loss of chandlers and glaziers. Did you take a survey of the different streets last night?</P>

<P>Then you did'nt meet my journeymen?</P>

<P>Oh! yes, I might have been reinforced by four chandlers at Northumberland House, but I found 'em so well posted, and doing so much execution, that I thought it a pity to disturb them.</P>
