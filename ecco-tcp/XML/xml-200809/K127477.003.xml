<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE our hero went to Port∣man-square, he called at his former lodgings, to enquire for the servant who had attended him during his residence in town. The man was en∣gaged; but the master of the house in∣formed him "he knew another whom he could recommend in every re∣spect." Sir George agreed to take him, and desired he might follow him to Lord Milbanke's, where ac∣cordingly he arrived that evening; and our hero being much pleased
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
with his appearance, and finding him at once steady, active, and diligent, determined to engage him as a regu∣lar servant. On asking him if he would be willing to leave London, and reside with him in Northumber∣land, the man replied, "he would follow him with pleasure any whi∣ther; but that Northumberland was his native county, and he should most truly rejoice to return to it."</P>
<P>"To what part of it do you be∣long?" said Sir George.</P>
<P>"To Warrington, your honour; farmer Bever, your tenant, is my fa∣ther."</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>"I am very glad I happened to meet with you," said Sir George; "your father is as honest a man as any in the village, and I shall be happy to have one of his family in my service. But how came you to be disengaged?"</P>
<P>"I am afraid, Sir," returned the man, "if I tell you I left my last place in disgrace as it were, you will have a bad opinion of me; but indeed I was not to blame: if you will hear the whole story, I am sure you will think so."</P>
<P>Sir George replied, "Very willing∣ly;" and the servant began:</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>"I lived several years with Mrs. Barclay in her first husband's time; and, when she married Mr. Saxby and went abroad, she chose me out of the family as her attendant."</P>
<P>"Mr. Saxby!" interrupted our hero with surprise and emotion— "Did you live with him?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," said the man, asto∣nished at his vehemence.</P>
<P>"Well then, go on," cried Sir George.</P>
<P>The fellow obeyed; and mention∣ed his meeting with Louisa More∣land,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
her distress, and his contriving with Lucy Clerke to bring her as far as Montreuil, word for word as Louisa had herself related it, and went on thus:</P>
<P>"At Montreuil we were to stay some weeks; and in the mean time I had the pleasure of seeing the young lady set off for England, with two nuns who had been turned out of their convent; and very glad I was. But, as ill-luck would have it, some∣how or other my mistress discovered what we had done; and being, poor lady! a little jealous, though indeed she has some reason for it, could not be persuaded that we did it out of
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
compassion, but fancied Master had some hand in it. She was, therefore, so angry with Lucy and myself, that she said 'she would not keep us a mi∣nute after we got to London, and that we might think ourselves very well off that she did not turn us adrift upon foreign ground.' So we were discharged here, and Mr. and Mrs. Saxby went down to Barclay Manor. To be sure, I was very sorry, as I wanted to see my father and mother when I had been away so long: but I did not like to go down and say I had been turned off, but wished to get me a place here; and if your honour takes me as your ser∣vant, I shall be very proud indeed,
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
and can shew my face at Warrington with the greater pleasure because I've bettered myself by the ex∣change."</P>
<P>Sir George, who knew the truth of all he had asserted, was extremely pleased at having gained an atten∣dant of whose principles he had so high an opinion; at the same time felt gratified by the conviction that he had not been wholly imposed up∣on, since Louisa's story was no fic∣tion, however strangely she had since derogated from her natural charac∣ter. He now told James "he had acted like a humane and benevolent man, and that he should be no loser;"
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
and then enquired where his fellow-servant was.</P>
<P>James replied—"With an aunt in the Borough, waiting till she could get a place." A summons to dinner now put an end to their conversation for the present; and Sir George went down stairs, more than ever perplex∣ed how to reconcile the inconsisten∣cies in Louisa's character. At table he observed Lady Milbanke was un∣commonly dejected; and, when she left the gentlemen over their wine, he expressed his fears that she was ill. "No," replied his Lordship, "not ill, but grieved at the result of an enquiry we made this morning for
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
her niece, whom she expected from France, as we have reason to fear her situation is very forlorn, but can obtain no certain intelligence."</P>
<P>"May I ask the particulars?" said our hero.</P>
<P>Certainly," returned Lord Mil∣banke. "About twelve or fourteen years ago, and just before we were married, Sophia's half brother Mr. Moreland went abroad to reside, en∣raged at the loss of a law-suit, and extremely angry with his sister be∣cause she refused to give her evidence in his favour, though justice for∣bad it; for, in conscience, had she
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
said any thing in court, it would have been against him, as she was tho∣roughly convinced his cause was not a just one. In consequence of this dispute, he kept up no correspondence with her; but we occasionally heard of him from those of our acquaint∣ance who went through —; and learnt that he lived wholly a recluse from the world, and had placed his daughter as a boarder in a convent; and we some time since were inform∣ed of his death, and that she meant to remain in the same situation. Lady Milbanke then, at my particu∣lar request, wrote to offer her an asy∣lum with us; but we have too much reason to fear the letter never reached
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
her, as about that time the convent was destroyed, and all its unfortunate inhabitants turned loose on the wide world. On hearing this, we made a point of enquiring for our young relation among the emigrants who hourly flocked to London, and at last were fortunate enough to meet with some ladies who had belonged to the same convent, and learnt Louisa Moreland had refused to ac∣company them, because she would not leave the Abbess, who was then in a very ill state of health. We then wrote to her again, but received no answer, and continued in the most uneasy state of solicitude. A few days since we were accidentally in
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
company with a Madame St. Val from Montreuil, who informed us that herself and a friend had been ac∣companied to England by a Miss Moreland, who, on their arrival in town, had taken a place in one of the northern stages, with an inten∣tion to go as far as —, where she told them her former nurse re∣sided, who, she was assured, would receive and protect her. On learn∣ing this, we instantly dispatched a servant to —, who returned this morning, and said 'no lady of that name or description had been seen in the village, and that the farmer whom Madame St. Val had men∣tioned was dead as well as his wife.'
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
This is the real cause of Lady Mil∣banke's dejection, as the uncertainty of Louisa's situation, so young and, as we are told, extremely handsome, fills her with a thousand apprehen∣sions for her safety. Various are the temptations she may meet with, and, strangers as we are to her mind and principles, who can tell whether she may have power to resist them!"</P>
<P>Sir George assented to this with a deep sigh, for he too well knew they had not assailed her in vain; con∣scious, from the beginning of the story. Lady Milbanke's niece and his once beloved Louisa were the same. Indeed he had with difficulty
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
concealed his emotions during the recital; but his uncle attributed them wholly to compassion, and loved him the better for the interest he had taken in the unknown Louisa.</P>
<P>At supper the conversation was renewed, and Lady Milbanke ex∣pressed the tenderest concern for her lost niece. Sir George, agitated as he was, did not let fall an expression that could give them an idea he had any knowledge of her—too sensible his information would only add to her uneasiness: and unwilling, if they should meet, to prejudice them in her disfavour, at the same time de∣termined, on his return to the coun∣try,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
to visit Mrs. Edgeworth, and if possible learn from her where Miss Moreland now was, and then give her information where she might gain a certain asylum if her beha∣viour entitled her to protection. He now saw those features in Lady Mil∣banke which he had so much ad∣mired at his first introduction to her, were exactly resembling those of her niece, and that they had both the same beautiful turn of countenance, the same brilliant and expressive eyes.</P>
<P>Several days passed away very pleasantly. Our hero was in a new world, where every thing was de∣lightful,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
and the society superior to any he had ever before enjoyed; as Lord and Lady Milbanke rather sought a pleasant than a general ac∣quaintance—men of wit and bril∣liancy, but not men of the world— women of fashion, but not women of levity—those whose manners had received the highest polish; not that polish which destroys the intrinsic value of the metal, but that which adds to it—where virtue was not thrown aside as an old-fashioned gar∣ment, but only so well adorned as to appear like a new and becoming habit. Politics in these parties were a subject seldom started; and at home Lord Milbanke cautiously
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
avoided it, guessing the sentiments of our hero were like those of his father, and rather wishing he should be con∣verted by a better knowledge of the world, than by the mere force of ar∣guments he felt unwilling to employ lest they should prove unsuccessful; and Sir George concealed his prin∣ciples, from a certainty that they would not meet with his uncle's ap∣probation.</P>
<P>One evening, when Lord Mil∣banke, from a particular engagement, had not seen our hero during the day, he addressed him on their first meeting thus, but with a smile: "Sir George, what are you about
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
in London?—I am afraid, going on in a bad way, since you are obliged to sell or pawn your plate."</P>
<P>"Pawn my plate!" returned he laughing, "That would be a bad story indeed. You must not, my dear Sir, continue to countenance me if this be true; but, jesting apart, what is it you mean?"</P>
<P>"Well then," said his Lordship, "you shall have the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. You must know there is a young man whom I have assisted to the utmost of my power, but I fear with little effect; since the rage of gambling
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
has seized him, and, unless he speedily reforms, must reduce him to poverty. This morning I received a very pe∣nitential letter from him, informing me he was reduced to his last shilling, and had even pawned his watch for immediate support. Infinitely shock∣ed at this (for his father was a brave officer, belonging to the regiment I was once in), I resolved to make one more effort to preserve him, and accord∣ingly called at his lodgings, where I found all he had told me was too true. I gave him sufficient for his present necessity, and then bade him go with me to the pawnbroker's to redeem his watch, that I might not be imposed on. Having completed
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
this business, I accidentally cast my eyes on an immense silver tankard, and discovered the Warrington and Milbanke arms quartered; and this convinced me the cup belonged to your family. I asked the man care∣lessly from whence he had it; and the hesitation in his manner when he re∣plied, assured me it had not been obtained honestly. Tell me, have you lost such a thing?"</P>
<P>Sir George during this speech had been so much agitated, that he thought it prudent to disclose the reason as far as it was in his power, without mentioning Louisa.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22"/>"Frankly then," returned he, "I will tell you all. I have not lost the cup; but it was given by my father, when I was christened, to Mr. Thom∣son, the Vicar of Warrington, since my tutor: from him it has been stolen, and I acknowledge through my means."</P>
<P>"What!" interrupted his Lord∣ship, "did you hire any body to <HI>recover</HI> it?"</P>
<P>"No indeed," cried Sir George laughing; "but, deceived by a tale of distress, I recommended a person to the attention of Mr. Thomson,
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
who repaid his care with the blackest ingratitude, taking an opportunity of carrying off not only that but seve∣ral other things of real value; and I am particularly glad of this intelli∣gence, as I will go to-morrow to the pawnbroker's, and regain all I can."</P>
<P>"And will you not prosecute the villain, if you can find him?" said Lord Milbanke.</P>
<P>"Certainly," replied our hero faintly; "but I am sure I shall not meet with him. Indeed I have been deeply imposed upon; and it was the
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
recollection of this that caused the confusion you witnessed when you began your story."</P>
<P>Lord Milbanke now saw the sub∣ject pained him, though why he could not guess, and instantly turned the conversation.</P>
<P>The next morning our hero went to the pawnbroker's, and, instantly discovering what he was in search of, asked the man how it came in his possession. He replied, "It was left there to be sold with several other things by a young lady whose name he was not at liberty to mention."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>"Let me see them," cried Sir George.</P>
<P>The fellow obeyed, and produced every article of any value that had been taken from Warrington, except the necklace and ear-rings, which he said "he expected home every hour, as they were only let out to a lady to appear in at the play the evening before." Our hero then enquired their price, and found it, though far below their real value, as much beyond what he thought pro∣per to bestow on a worthless woman; and therefore, requesting a pen and ink, wrote the following note:</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>"Sir George Warrington will leave ten guineas with the master of this shop, for the several articles brought from Warrington and its neighbourhood, if the owner will part with them on these terms; if not, he will apply to a justice of the peace, and take legal measures to re∣cover them."</P>
<P>This he gave to the man, desiring it might be immediately delivered to the young lady he spoke of, and then left the house. On returning the next morning, he was informed the things should be all restored on his paying the promised sum.
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
This he complied with; and seeing them properly packed up, for which he bestowed a farther gratuity, call∣ed a hackney-coach, and conveyed them safely to his uncle's house, who sincerely rejoiced in his suc∣cess. A few days after this event, he was obliged to take an abrupt leave of his amiable relations, re∣ceiving a hasty summons from Mr. Davenport, which he knew not how to refuse. But he did not quit London, till he heard from Mr. Thomson that the valuable packet he had sent was arrived at War∣rington, and the different articles it contained restored to their pro∣per
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
owners, nor without promising again to visit Portman-square once more before his return to Northum∣berland.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero had scarcely paid his first compliments at Violet Hill, when he began to relate the various occurrences he had met with in town, so eager was he to vindicate the cha∣racter of Louisa from some of the crimes it was charged with, as well as to defend his own penetration: "for," added he, "all she told me of her previous history must be true, since it has been confirmed by two persons, one of whom at lead is a woman of undoubted veracity, and
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
the other could have no motive for asserting a falsehood."</P>
<P>To his great surprise, whilst relat∣ing these circumstances, he observed Rosetta and Fidelia look at each other in great confusion; and, when he spoke of his intention of visiting Mrs. Edgeworth, Fidelia replied very eagerly:—"That, Sir George, must be deferred—Mrs. Edgeworth is not in the country."</P>
<P>"When she returns, I can take an opportunity of calling on her," re∣plied our hero coldly; and, turning to Miss Wilmot, saw in her coun∣tenance marks of surprise that asto∣nished
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
and perplexed him; but he had no time to enter farther on the subject, as at that moment Mr. Da∣venport entered, and of course the conversation took another turn.</P>
<P>With much art that gentleman hinted to our hero the good effect his remonstrances would probably have on Mr. Annesley, and advised him not to delay his application be∣yond the following day, as the ma∣nufacturers were all ready to attend him. Our hero replied, "he was perfectly at leisure, and would meet them in New Barn Lane, the place of rendezvous, at ten o'clock." Mr. Davenport, delighted at gaining his
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
point, having feared so many days residence with his aristocratic rela∣tion might have occasioned a revo∣lution in his sentiments, now took leave, promising the men should be punctual: and our hero retired, with no other idea than that he should rise to perform a glorious and noble action, in which his own courage and abilities would be called forth for the universal good of mankind; and in this disposition he met the family at breakfast. Myrtilla looked at him with a mixture of grief and pity; but the other young ladies were too much devoted to themselves ever to bestow a thought on him with which
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
their own immediate interest was not connected.</P>
<P>At a quarter before ten his horse was brought him, and, mounting it instantly, he soon reached New Barn Lane, where the men were all as∣sembled before him. They received him with three cheers; and one going before as a guide, the rest followed our hero's horse; and they proceeded for two miles towards Mr. Annesley's in a regular and quiet manner, when, go∣ing through a gate, they perceived at a distance three men guarding another, whose hands were tied in a way that implied his villany. When they
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
met, Sir George's party demanded the cause of his captivity, and were told by one of the constables, "he was a famous poacher who had been con∣victed on Mr. Saville's manor, and was now going to gaol."—"What!" cried the foremost, "suffer a man to go to gaol for taking a hare or a pheasant! No no, we are liberty and equality men, and will rescue him from your tyranny."</P>
<P>At these words, they all attacked his conductors; the poacher was soon released; who joined his friends glad∣ly in tying the two constables to a tree, whilst the other fellow, who
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
had been witness of the fact, and was his accuser, took to his heels and ran off with all possible expedition.</P>
<P>Sir George, though he felt some∣thing ashamed of thus heading a party who were violating the laws of their country, and would not join them in their attack, knew not how to oppose it, because he had always considered the game-laws as too strict; and indeed, since the new opinions he had taken up had per∣mitted his manor to be open to every person, poor as well as rich, he only remonstrated on their cruelty to the constables; for he was ignorant
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
that the man was a hardened villain, and an offender in many other in∣stances.</P>
<P>They replied, "The constables de∣served much more;" and then having listened to the poacher's story, who, like the rest of the world when they are their own biographers, placed his character in the most favourable point of view, began to imagine Mr. Saville was the most unjust and cruel man in the world, and declared "they would go to his house, and give him a lesson before they pro∣ceeded to Mr. Annesley's." Our hero objected to this: but the mul∣titude prevailed; and he merely con∣sented
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
from a hope of being able to see Mr. Saville, who was a stran∣ger to him, and apologize for the conduct of his attendants in releas∣ing the man he had committed to justice. The poacher led the way, and, at the end of five additional miles, they arrived in sight of his house. At the entrance of a field near it, they met two servants; and, on en∣quiring for their master, one said, "He was at home;" but the other de∣nied it. Fancying the last who spoke had not said the truth, the men in∣sisted on seeing him, and declared, "if he did not come out to them, they would enter the house forcibly, and set it on fire." The servants
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
begged for God's sake they would use no violence, for that their lady was lately brought to bed. The ringleader of this party replied with a brutal oath: "They cared not, and would put their threat in execution, if their master did not come out."</P>
<P>The servants then ran towards the house, and said "he should come to them," but entreated they would stay where they were: but this they did not choose to comply with, and moved on till they were within fifty yards of the great door, in spite of Sir George, who, infinitely shocked at their conduct, used entreaties, re∣monstrances, threats, and bribes, in
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
vain. They had all pushed before him; but he followed close, in hopes he might at last persuade them to give up these horrid measures, and retire peaceably. To this effect he harangued them, representing with such force the cruelty of their in∣tended conduct, that five or six join∣ed him, and, going on his side, de∣clared "they would fight with him till the last drop of their blood was shed in his service." The rest, who were more daring fellows, exasperated at this, became only more desperate, and swore, if Mr. Saville did not ap∣pear, the house should be burnt without mercy. They were now close by the railing that parted the
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
small lawn before the door from the paddock, but, in listening and reply∣ing to Sir George, had turned their backs to the gate, and appeared ra∣ther as if defending it from his as∣saults than intending to enter them∣selves.</P>
<P>In the mean time the servants had alarmed the family. Mr. Saville was really absent; but Mrs. Saville's brother, Captain Montague, being informed a party of villains headed by a gentleman were coming to at∣tack the house, in consequence of his brother's having committed a poacher to justice, took down his sword and pistols, and, accompanied
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
by a dragoon soldier his servant, and those of the family, all armed as well as the short time would permit, fallied forth to repel the intruders. Just as they were coming round a back-way, they met a country lad who on the first alarm had been sent out as a spy to reconnoitre, and from him learnt the party was divided, and some of them had taken his mas∣ter's part. This was good news, as the Captain's company was not so strong but they required a reinforce∣ment; and still pursuing their first plan, went out through the stables, and met the other party in the field.</P>
<P>Unfortunately Sir George had been
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
told by Mr. Davenport, as an incite∣ment to his courage, that there were several gentlemen who would gladly join him, did they once know his in∣tentions with respect to the general equality of mankind; and, not hav∣ing observed from whence Captain Montague came, concluded, in the confusion of his spirits, that he was an auxiliary to the opposite party; but his resolution of defending the unfortunate Savilles was not damp∣ed by the increase of his enemies. His countenance glowing with the ardour he felt in the real cause of humanity, his eyes sparkling with honest indignation, he thus addressed the men who were still leaning against
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
the gates, pouring out threats and imprecations:</P>
<P>"I insist on your opposing me no longer; yield to me this moment, or by Heaven you shall all feel the fullest weight of my resentment. Depart quietly, and let me enter the gates; Mr. Saville shall then know—"</P>
<P>Here he was unhappily interrupted by the Captain, who, arriving at that instant, and judging, from his speech as well as his position, he was about to make a forcible entry, struck him a blow with the flat side of his hanger that almost beat him from
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
his horse. The opposite party, equal∣ly misled, supposing the Captain on their side, exclaimed unanimously, "Huzza! we have now an addition, and will conquer."</P>
<P>Sir George, recovering, exclaimed resentfully, "This is not to be borne!" and then asked Captain Mon∣tague, in a determined tone, what he meant by his conduct, and why he thus opposed the cause of virtue and humanity?</P>
<P>Too much enraged to hear reason, and taking all that was said in a wrong sense, he replied furiously: "Whoever you are, you are a scan∣dal
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
to the name of man; and I shall answer no impertinent questions. Be assured, I have good reasons for what I do, and can answer my conduct, both to my judgment and my con∣science: that is more than you can do; but we waste time. I would with pleasure head these honest fellows, but wish to expose the life of no in∣dividual; as for my own I care not, but will gladly lay it down, if Hea∣ven so choose, in the defence of all most dear to me."</P>
<P>"Come on then," cried Sir George warmly. Captain Montague gave him a pistol, and he fired without effect. The other returned the fire,
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
and the ball entering his side, he fell at once to the ground apparently dead.</P>
<P>The humanity of the Captain was now much shocked at the idea of having so suddenly deprived a fel∣low creature of existence, and that too at a moment, as he believed, when he was rashly committing crimes, the extent of which no one could judge. He ordered his man to carry him into the house, and sent instantly for a surgeon. The servant obeyed; and the few adherents of Sir George stood irresolute, dismayed, and alarmed at his fate; whilst the opposite party exultingly cried out,
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
"Now we have this brave gentleman at our head, and the other is done for, we will go and set the house on fire this moment."</P>
<P>"Set the house on fire! What house?" exclaimed the Captain.</P>
<P>"Why, 'squire Saville's, to be sure," cried the ringleader; "that was what we came for, but that there gentleman would not let us; but now he's gone, we will break down the gates, and have at them; so come on, come on, my boys."</P>
<P>"Stay, villains," interrupted Cap∣tain Montague, "and tell me what
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
motive induces you to commit this act of outrage? What redress do you ask? For what injury of my brother's do you seek revenge?"</P>
<P>One of the men who had been con∣vinced by Sir George's arguments now came forward, and, desiring silence, explained the whole affair in a manner tolerably clear; placed the conduct of our hero in a right point of view, and made Captain Mon∣tague understand his own fatal mis∣apprehension. But he had no time to reflect on the unhappy consequences; for the men became outrageous, and he was obliged to exert himself and rally his own party; when they were
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
suddenly relieved by the sight of ano∣ther at a little distance, all of whom he knew would be on his side, as they were led by the footman, who had previously escaped on the first attack, and had raised the inhabi∣tants of a neighbouring village. By the assistance of these, the villains were soon dispersed, and the ring∣leaders seized and committed to jus∣tice. Captain Montague exerted himself vigorously, and with such success, that in a short time the field was cleared, many of the wretches secured, and the rest ran away. Those who had previously repented of their intended outrage went quietly to their own homes, but not till they
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
had learned that Sir George shewed some signs of life, though his reco∣very was yet extremely doubtful.</P>
<P>Captain Montague, when his im∣mediate fears for his sister's family were removed, was agonized with remorse and horror at the reflection of having too probably killed the man who was nobly risquing his own life for their safety and defence. He enquired his name of some of the people; and, learning he was Sir George Warrington, his grief increas∣ed almost to phrensy. He flew into the house, and, meeting the sur∣geon, asked his real opinion. That was little calculated to relieve his

mind: he said "his recovery was so doubtful, he thought his friends ought to be immediately informed of his situation; that the ball had in∣deed happily missed his lungs; but the effusion of blood had been so violent, that, though the wound in itself was not mortal, he could not answer for his recovery."</P>
<P>Distracted at this intelligence, he called for his horse, and, instantly riding over to Violet Hill, related to the family the melancholy events of the day, and the unhappy part he had taken in them, and voluntarily offered to surrender himself to justice. Mr. Wilmot was deeply shocked at
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
the consequences of his young friend's undertaking the cause suggested by Mr. Davenport, which in his heart he had never approved, though he allowed its justice; and resolved im∣mediately to set off for Saville House, from whence it was impossible to re∣move Sir George, and judge himself of his situation. He was accompa∣nied by James Bever, who was ex∣tremely concerned on learning the accident that had befallen his mas∣ter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wilmot said, "It was a great pity so fine a young man should be thus cut off in the prime of life." Rosetta sobbed—Fidelia fainted, or
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
pretended to faint—but Myrtilla felt deeply, secretly, and doubly: a thou∣sand anxieties preyed on her mind, which she dared not reveal; for she had no confidante in her own family, and her favourite friend was at a dis∣tance which precluded all communi∣cation but by letter. Captain Mon∣tague was too anxious for our hero to remain longer at the Hill when he had the ladies a little recovered. Myr∣tilla followed him to the door, where he mounted his horse: she attempted to speak, but could not; and again bursting into tears, a servant appear∣ing at that moment, she returned to the parlour; but, disgusted by her mother's insensibility and her sisters'
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
affectation, retired hastily to her own room, where she indulged without restraint the grief and horror that tor∣mented her mind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN Montague, on his ar∣rival at home, heard that Mr. Wil∣mot was sitting by his wounded friend, who was fallen into a happy slumber that promised relief and amendment. He then went to his sister's chamber, which fortunately was not in the front of the house; and great care having been taken by her immediate attendants, she knew nothing of the confusion and terror they had been in till it was wholly subsided; and then was only told
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
such particulars as it was necessary she should be informed of, to account for the bustle the arrival of the sur∣geon and the accommodating our hero had occasioned. Her brother now related some farther circum∣stances, and hinted a wish, though Miss Wilmot was unknown to her, that she would invite her to the house, alleging that between her and the wounded man, to whom every atten∣tion was due, there subsisted a real friendship; and that consequently her presence would contribute to his comfort, and perhaps hasten his re∣covery. Mrs. Saville the more rea∣dily assented as she meant to go down stairs the following day; and
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
the message was sent by Mr. Wilmot, to whom the same compliment was paid; but he declined it. Captain Montague then re-urged his request, and added, that Mrs. Saville, who was wholly a stranger in that coun∣try, having only been there a few days previous to her confinement, would be happy in that opportunity of cultivating the friendship of a fa∣mily so amiable and so respected as that at Violet Hill.</P>
<P>Here Captain Montague for once acted like a man of the world: for the family at Violet Hill he cared nothing; but for one individual of it he felt all that a lover can feel;
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
how much that is, I leave to be de∣cided by the younger part of my fe∣male readers. In fact, to make a mystery no longer of what there is no real reason for concealing, Cap∣tain Montague was the incognito ad∣mirer of Myrtilla Wilmot: but, a stranger to the rest of her family, he had persuaded his sister to accept the offer made by her husband's eldest brother, on his going abroad for his lady's health, to reside in their house during their absence, that he might form an acquaintance with them, and perhaps influence Mr. Wilmot in his favour. Mr. Edward Saville, in com∣pliance with his wife's request, con∣sented to take up his abode in —
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
shire for some months; but, being detained in town by law business, had been there but a few days when the poacher was committed by his orders. Captain Montague, ob∣taining leave of absence from his re∣giment, had arrived only the night before; therefore had no opportunity of informing Miss Wilmot, though she was previously acquainted with his plan, and had urged her mother with unusual earnestness to wait on Mrs. Saville. But Mrs. Wilmot al∣ways replied, "It was too far—she would not take the trouble of visit∣ing at such a distance;" and Myrtilla could not go without her. Of course the invitation which Mr. Wilmot de∣livered,
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
and which he as well as her mother consented she should accept, filled her heart with a degree of hope and joy; and the more as it had been torn by the knowledge of Sir George Warrington's danger, whom she sin∣cerely esteemed, and her consequent fears for her beloved Montague, whose safety, she concluded, depend∣ed on the life of our hero.</P>
<P>Mrs. Saville was prepared to esteem and love her; and, on her arrival the next morning, she met with the most cordial reception from all the family but our unfortunate hero, who was yet insensible to all that passed. To∣wards evening, however, he revived;
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
and the surgeon gave more hopes of him than he had yet done. A quiet night and the unremitted attention of Captain Montague and Mr. Sa∣ville, with the occasional presence of Myrtilla, all contributed to re∣store him; and in a few days he was pronounced not merely out of dan∣ger, but in a fair way of recovery.</P>
<P>Lord Milbanke, who had been sent for immediately on the accident, now took leave for some time, as he was obliged to attend parliament, but chose not to quit his nephew whilst he remained so extremely ill. Be∣tween Mrs. Saville and Myrtilla a real friendship was soon formed; their
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
minds were similar, their hearts equal∣ly excellent, and their understandings equally cultivated. Mr. Saville, who was a most amiable man, saw this with pleasure, and promised Captain Montague he would himself under∣take to speak for him to Mr. Wilmot, who, he doubted not, would consent to give him his daughter, as he had very good interest in his professional line—an independent, though not a large fortune—and was certain of an addition to it on the death of an old lady his great-aunt, whose jointure was entailed on him. The family all united in their attentions to our hero, who was now able to sit up and enjoy their conversation some
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
part of every day; and, as he conti∣nued to mend, their little circle be∣came extremely cheerful.</P>
<P>Mr. Saville and Captain Mon∣tague discovered, on their farther ac∣quaintance, that Sir George possess∣ed an excellent heart and a superior understanding, and wished to remove those prejudices, which obscured his virtues and made every good qua∣lity subservient to their own purposes. To effect this, they laid in his way those publications they thought most proper for their plan, and observed with pleasure he read them with avidity and apparent conviction. The newspapers of the day were also
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
constantly on his table: and learning from them, and particularly from the famous, or rather infamous, speech of Du Pont, that the gene∣rality of those who betrayed their king denied their God, he was seized with a horror inexpressible, and, with a quickness which distin∣guished all the actions and revolu∣tions of his mind, he rang the bell; and a servant entering, he desired to see Mr. Saville immediately. Mr. Saville, surprised at this hasty sum∣mons, ran up stairs, and, perceiving an unusual degree of emotion in his countenance, enquired what was the matter. Sir George, pointing to the paper, replied: "My good friend, is
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
this true, or is it the trick of party? I know your candour equals your other good qualities, and can depend on your word."</P>
<P>Mr. Saville answered coolly, "It was undoubtedly true, and nothing extraordinary; since those who could act as they had done must expect the scene to close for ever in this world, or they would not risk the terrors of eternity in the next."</P>
<P>Sir George shuddered at this reply, and, asking still farther questions, was still more shocked to think he had adopted the sentiments and approved the conduct of atheists and infidels—
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
of those to whom murder was sport, and sacrilege glory.</P>
<P>Mr. Saville now saw this was a proper time to work on his feelings; and representing in a cool dispas∣sionate manner the actions of the democrates, from the moment of their gaining an ascendancy to that stain∣ed with the blood of their guiltless and unfortunate monarch, he pro∣ceeded to inform him, "that whoever led, even in the most distant way, towards a revolution in this now happy, because innocent, kingdom, would be in a degree answerable for all the ills that might follow. Those, Sir George," continued he, "who
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
raise a spirit of discontent only in one man, know not how far the evil may extend, and that it may cause a ne∣ver-ending calamity. As a proof: had you not been induced by the arguments of Mr. Davenport to in∣fuse rebellious sentiments into the minds of those who followed you to this house, they would have gone on in their old way, quietly and even happily: Mr. Annesley would not have been the object of their anger, and consequently of their vengeance: and, had they not been collected in a body, I should have been safe from their attacks; and but for the inter∣vention of Providence, my brother's activity, and your bravery, what
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
might have been the consequences! My wife, my child, my property, would all have been lost!—And for what?"</P>
<P>Sir George, struck with the force of his arguments, and the last in particular, wrung his hand, and with much emotion requested his pardon.</P>
<P>"You have no pardon, Sir George, to ask of me," returned Mr. Saville: "you defended me bravely and no∣bly when you discovered their vio∣lent intentions: but you were the first cause; and I only wish to con∣vince you of the impropriety of your
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
conduct." He then in a long speech, which it is unnecessary to repeat, as it contained only the best arguments from all those who have so ably ex∣erted their talents for the good of their country, proved to him, beyond a doubt, that a revolution in this kingdom would be its destruction, as it had been that of France; and that without the same plea—since, whatever trivial faults there might be in our Constitution, it was, on the whole, the best calculated to promote the happiness of the people in ge∣neral: that equality was neither to be wished for nor expected, in a country where every man rose by his merits, and that degree of exertion
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
which gave a spirit of emulation, without which, like a stagnant pool, we should grow inactive and corrupt; whereas, in the present state of the kingdom, every man displayed the abilities nature had bestowed on him, to raise him to that station he was conscious his merit deserved."</P>
<P>When he had repeated all that occurred to him on the subject, and placed Mr. Davenport's character and conduct in its proper light, he concluded by saying, "And now, Sir George, are you convinced?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, my best friend," replied our hero, "I am; and I blush at the recollection of my folly, and at the dis∣covering
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
what a dupe I have been made. The few incidents of my journey ought to have opened my eyes; and perhaps they would, had I fallen into the hands of unprejudiced people: but, led astray by the apparently amiable idea of universal justice, charity, benevolence, and religion, I have committed the most flagrant crimes against them all. As an act of jus∣tice, I have opposed the laws of my country; as the champion of the poor, I have taken away their com∣forts, by displaying to their view miseries they were before unacquaint∣ed with; and, in my universal philan∣thropy, have headed a party of vil∣lains, and in my enthusiasm might
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
(had it not pleased Heaven to place before my view the horrors of the action) have destroyed the virtuous and the innocent, whilst I fancied myself taking the part of the bene∣volent and humane. Though strong∣ly attached to the religion of my country in particular, and of course to the Christian religion in general, I have followed, applauded, and admired, those who have renounced it—whose crimes, whose barbarity, proved they had renounced it; though till this day I knew not that they boldly triumphed in their infidelity, and gloried in denying the existence of a power superior to their own. Mr. Davenport's conduct fills me
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
with disgust. I see his meanness, his duplicity, and am thankful to Hea∣ven that I did not fall a victim to it; and, on a retrospection of my own, I have no comfort but in re∣flecting that I meant not to injure Mr. Annesley, only to remonstrate with him on what I then thought his injustice: and that with respect to yourself, from the first moment of the party's determining to come to your house, I opposed them; and, when I found opposition vain, only agreed to attend them, from a hope of convincing you that I had taken no active part in releasing the man you had committed."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74"/>"Say no more on this subject, I beseech you, my dear Sir George," returned Mr. Saville; "I have only spoken for your good, and only wish for your happiness." Our hero thanked him with the utmost since∣rity and the entrance of the ladies; now put an end to the conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>Considering Mr. Saville and Cap∣tain Montague as his best friends, our hero intrusted them with the se∣cret of his unfortunate attachment; nor was Mrs. Saville excluded from his confidence. That lady, who possessed real good sense and much knowledge of the world, was asto∣nished
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
at his relation, for he con∣cealed no circumstance from them.</P>
<P>"I see," said she, "the ar∣dency of your temper requires a check rather than a spur; yet I must say (though I beg you will not suf∣fer yourself to be too much elated by it), that there is a mystery in all this not easily accounted for, and which I would advise you to deve∣lop when your health is restored. Call on Mrs. Edgeworth, enquire of her the precise time when Miss More∣land became an inmate of her fa∣mily, and the particulars of her con∣duct whilst she remained in it Then go to London, and, if you can, trace
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
her through the means of the pawn-broker: see her yourself; trust the evidence of nothing but your own senses; and I have some hopes this apparently strange affair may be cleared up to your satisfaction. There is, Sir George, more consistency in the human character than you perhaps imagine; and it is therefore very improbable that a young woman, so amiable in every respect as Louisa must have been, from her own story, which was confirmed by the testi∣mony of Lady M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lbanke and your servant James Bever, should all on a sudden, without any visible motive, become a disgrace to her sex: it is
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
not natural, trace it in what way you will. Had she designed to make her fortune by attracting your notice, she would have secured the favour of Mr. and Mrs. Thomson as the leading step to yours. Had she been tempted solely by interest, she must surely have succeeded better by re∣lying on your bounty, than by ha∣zarding her life for the sake of a few guineas—for more it could not have been. To confess the truth, it ap∣pears to me, that some person who overheard your conversation took on themselves her name and cha∣racter, and thus imposed on your friends; though, how she could con∣trive
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
it, I own I am at a loss to de∣termine."</P>
<P>Sir George, delighted with this idea, willingly indulged it, and re∣solved to follow her advice the mo∣ment it was in his power. Indeed the animation this hope gave him con∣tributed greatly to his recovery; and, in a fortnight from this time, he was well enough to return to Violet Hill, where he wished to spend a few days, partly for the purpose of paying his intended visit to Mrs. Edgeworth, and partly because he thought it a civility due to a family from whom he had received many instances of friendship, and from Mr. Wilmot
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
in particular during his late confine∣ment.</P>
<P>In the intermediate time, he em∣ployed himself in writing to Lord Milbanke and Mr. Thomson; to both of whom the account of his reformation was extremely welcome. Indeed the former knew not his po∣litical sentiments, till he received the letter in which Mr. Saville gave him a recital of the accident, at the re∣quest of Mr. Wilmot. But of Miss Moreland he said nothing, determined to be fully convinced before he men∣tioned the subject to any but the Sa∣ville family and Myrtilla. The at∣tachment between her and Captain
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
Montague gave him real pleasure; and he gladly undertook to use all his interest with Mr. Wilmot to gain his consent to their union. Mr. Da∣venport quitted the country, on the first intelligence of the rencontre be∣tween our hero and Captain Mon∣tague, and meant not to return till the man he had so much misled, and might have so deeply injured, had left Violet Hill and its neighbour∣hood.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero took a grateful and affectionate leave of his friends at Saville House, whom he promised to revisit on his return from town; and accompanied by his faithful ser∣vant James Bever, who had paid him the strictest and most unwearied at∣tention during his confinement, ar∣rived at Mr. Wilmot's. Rosetta and Fidelia, piqued at not having been invited to Mr. Saville's, and mor∣tified by the coldness of Sir George's replies to their congratulations, be∣gan
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
to resign the hopes they had so long cherished. But each, fearing that in giving up her own cause she might forward that of her sister, formed, mutually but secretly, a plan to destroy the expectations of each other: but in the mean time a vio∣lent quarrel arising, at first, as most quarrels do, from a mere trifle, in the height of rage and resentment, they discovered their scheme; and, their fury increasing from this circum∣stance, they ran down into the par∣lour, where Sir George was sitting with Myrtilla, who had returned the day after him to Violet Hill. Fi∣delia entered first; but passion chok∣ed her utterance, and, stammering
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
out some invectives they could not un∣derstand, she threw herself into a chair, and waited to recover her breath. Rosetta, who was equally enraged, but less furious, soon followed, and, with that marked sneer which even the height of resentment could not suppress, said, "she supposed Fide∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a had been making her honourable confession of the part she had taken in destroying Miss Moreland's hap∣piness and ruining her character."</P>
<P>Rosetta was a perfect adept in every species of irony, except that distinguished by the name of humour, which is only used in pleasantry; for her irony was of the bitterest kind:
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
she had learned from her childhood every method of tormenting with her tongue, and was completely skill∣ed in using
<Q><L>The guarded phrase whose meaning kills; yet told,</L>
<L>The list'ner wonders how you thought it cold.</L></Q>
But at this moment, when her wrath was raised to its highest pitch, her art in some degree forsook her, and, in the pointed sarcasms she threw out against Fidelia, she too frequently ac∣cused herself.</P>
<P>The other was a vixen and a ter∣magant in the fullest sense of the words, though her usual air was all
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
mildness; and in the present instance, instead of seeking to defend herself, she only thought of pouring her rage on Rosetta; who, growing every mo∣ment more calm, as her artifice con∣quered her rage, desired the astonish∣ed and anxious Baronet to hold her sister's hands and stop her mouth, and she would explain what had so much perplexed him. This request he could not possibly comply with; and Fidelia becoming still more fu∣rious, it was with the utmost diffi∣culty he collected the following par∣ticulars from the different expressions they let fall:</P>
<P>That on making their charitable
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
and benevolent visit to Mrs. Edge∣worth to prevent her being any longer imposed upon, they learnt, to their utter dismay, that Louisa had been with her from the time, as near as they could guess, of her parting with Sir George: that, as this cir∣cumstance would have defeated all their views, they said nothing of the period, but only mentioned the events that had passed at Warrington, which they declared Sir George would cor∣roborate: but wishing to prevent their meeting, lest an eclaircissement should ensue, they hinted that Sir George was always affected by the subject, and avoided it as much as possible: they were therefore con∣vinced
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
in their own minds, that, as this was undoubtedly the real Miss Moreland, she who had been at Mr. Thomson's was certainly an impos∣tor. This was the substance of their information; but each accused the other of framing and executing the artifice; alleging, she only consent∣ed from a fear of exposing her sister.</P>
<P>Sir George was too much shocked and concerned to attempt a reply; but, darting on them looks of mingled horror and contempt, he seized Myr∣tilla's hand, exclaiming, "Forgive me, dear Miss Wilmot, for taking this abrupt leave of you; but I can stay no longer here, lest I should fail
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
in the respect due to your family, but not due to —". He stopped an instant in confusion, and then conti∣nued: "I shall see or hear of you at Saville House; in the mean time I will write to your father, apologize for my present conduct, and not for∣get my promise to you." Then has∣tily shaking her hand, he bade her once more farewell, and left the room.</P>
<P>He sent for his servant, and, order∣ing his horse immediately, bade James follow him with his baggage to the Star in the county town; and then rode off instantly, and soon arrived at Mr. Edgeworth's. On enquiring for his la∣dy, he was shewn into a parlour, where
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
he had scarcely time to recover from his agitation before she appeared. After informing her of his name, and apologizing for his intrusion—"Will you, Madam," said he, "allow me to ask you a few questions respecting the Miss Moreland so lately a resi∣dent in your family?"</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly, Sir," replied the lady; "as many as you please; though, believe me, I was sorry to find you and I had both been deceived in her."</P>
<P>"There was some mistake in all that, Madam," cried our hero, "which I wish to rectify."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90"/>"If the explanation," returned Mrs. Edgeworth, "is in her favour, I shall most truly rejoice to hear it; for never was there a more prepossess∣ing young woman than Louisa, and I was sincerely attached to her till I heard, from such undoubted au∣thority, she was so completely un∣worthy."</P>
<P>Our hero's eyes sparkled with pleasure. "Will you, Madam," said he, "only tell me at what time and at what place you first saw her? I will then give you my reasons."</P>
<P>"I was," replied she, "returning from —shire with my two eldest
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
daughters, whither we had accom∣panied their late governess, who was married to a clergyman; and stop∣ping at — to change horses, the woman of the house came out, and entreated, as it was growing late, that I would proceed no farther that night, as there were highwaymen in the neighbourhood. This terrified the children so completely, that for their sakes, though I was not afraid myself, I would not go on, but alighted instantly, and ordering tea, the landlady herself brought it in: and I then enquired what grounds she had for her suspicion. She re∣plied, 'A young lady came to her house a few hours before, who had
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
been stopped, and robbed, she be∣lieved, of all that she was worth in the world, as she was still in fits, and exclaimed continually she had nei∣ther money nor friends; that the post-boy said she was a foreigner; and added, that he was obliged to re∣turn without being paid for the chaise.'</P>
<P>"Struck with horror and compas∣sion at this account, I begged to see the young lady; and she instantly admitted me. As she was now more calm, I learnt that, having lost her father abroad, she came from France to stay with a woman who had taken care of her in her infancy; but that
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
finding her and her husband both dead, she was on the point of dis∣traction, when a gentleman, hearing her distress, had given her a bank∣note, and a letter of recommendation to a friend of his to take care of her till she could form some plan for her future subsistence. These were in∣closed in his pocket book, which, for greater safety, she placed in her trunk, which was in the carriage then waiting for her; consequently had only once read the direction, no trace of which now remained on her mind, which she imagined was owing to her being unaccustomed to Eng∣lish names; and that of her generous benefactor she was ignorant of. That
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
about half way between the place she left and that she was now in, a high∣wayman stopped the carriage: she gave him all that was in her pocket; but, that being only a few shillings, he was not satisfied, but insisted on her opening the trunk, and from thence took the pocket-book and all its contents, leaving her in a state of mind more easily imagined than de∣scribed. She added, she was now to∣tally without friends in this country, or any other; and that she had but one relation in the world—this was a half sister of her father's, whom she had never seen since her infancy; and as her father, from some family quarrel, had kept up no correspondence with
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
her, she knew not where to find her, and was totally ignorant of every circum∣stance relative to her, except that her maiden name was Moreland. She con∣cluded her little narrative, every word of which I gave implicit credit to, with an agonizing burst of tears. Much hurt at her distress, and fearing the con∣sequences of so forlorn a situation to such youth and beauty, I offered her an asylum with me for the present. She joyfully accepted it, and the next morning arrived at home. In a very short time I discovered that she spoke the French and Italian languages with the utmost propriety, and was a perfect mistress of painting, and every kind of fine work. This gave
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
me more satisfaction, as I really be∣gan to have an affection for her, and it was now in my power to secure her a permanent establishment as a go∣verness to my girls. She gladly un∣dertook the task, and I every day found greater reason to be satisfied with her conduct, and their progress in all the branches of education she undertook to teach them; till the visit of the Miss Wilmots obliged me to part with her. They asked me the same questions you have done, and I made them the same replies: they then assured me, that of the first part of her story they knew nothing, but believed it was as false as the rest; since you were the gentleman
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
who had given her the letter and mo∣ney; but that instead of losing it, as she had asserted, she had been at Warrington, where her conduct was so notoriously bad as to render her liable to a prosecution: that she bor∣rowed ornaments of the ladies to whom your letter had recommended her, and had taken them away, to∣gether with plate and money to a considerable amount from the fa∣mily she resided with. On hearing this, I would have questioned her; but Mr. Edgeworth, whose temper is a little warm, insisted on her leaving the house directly, and would not let me see her, lest, as he said, she should farther impose upon me. He went
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
up to her himself, and, without en∣tering into particulars, only said 'she must quit us instantly, and the sooner she went the better, as the gentleman who had seen her at church meant to prosecute her for a robbery, wherever he found her.' Terrified at this, she began to excuse herself: but Mr. Edgeworth refused to listen; and, or∣dering the carriage, he sent her off in less than an hour, and we have heard nothing of her since."</P>
<P>Sir George then, with much emo∣tion, begged to know exactly the day of their meeting; and, learning it, knew it to be that on which he had parted from her at —; con∣sequently
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
her innocence was evident. Clasping his hands together in an agony of grief and remorse, he ex∣claimed, "Just Heaven! what is become of the lovely, the injured Louisa?"</P>
<P>He then explained the whole af∣fair to Mrs. Edgeworth, who lis∣tened with astonishment and plea∣sure, mingled with a proper degree of contempt for Rosetta's and Fide∣lia's baseness; "who," she said, "must be themselves aware that the time did not agree, as they had told her it was many weeks since the af∣fair had happened at Warrington, when they must be conscious it was
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
during that period when Miss More∣land was resident under her roof. It will, however, Sir George," conti∣nued she, "be a lesson to me in fu∣ture to take nothing upon trust, but examine the truth of an accusation before I pretend to decide."</P>
<P>Sir George agreed with her as to the propriety of this; and then, con∣vinced he had no chance of gaining any farther intelligence of his beloved Louisa in this part of the country, determined to set out instantly for London, and trace the wretch who had robbed her and then assumed her name. Yet knowing it was too late to begin his journey that after∣noon,
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
he refused not Mrs. Edge∣worth's invitation to dinner, and was fully repaid, by hearing the sin∣cere testimony both that lady and her children paid to her merits. The little girls expressed their concern for her loss, and declared unanimously, "though she was always melancholy, she was never out of temper;" whilst Mrs. Edgeworth spoke of her talents, her understanding, and principles, in terms of the highest and warmest praise. Mr. Edgeworth was absent on a visit: a circumstance our hero by no means regretted, since he would have found it difficult to be cordial to one, the warmth of whose disposi∣tion had led him into an error that
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
had caused Sir George so much mi∣sery. In the evening he returned to his inn; and writing a few lines to Mr. Wilmot to apologize for leaving his house so abruptly, and a letter to Mr. Thomson, giving him a concise account of the important discovery, went to bed with a mind torn by a thousand contending emotions, deter∣mining, the next morning as soon as it was light, to set out on his return to London.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I relate the events of our hero's journey to town, it will be necessary to give my readers a clear account of all that happened to the unfortunate Louisa from the period of her parting with Sir George; who had not mentioned to her his name, from the desire he then felt of concealing his title from the world. This he chose not to explain to her, and therefore was silent on the sub∣ject; knowing, on her arrival at the vicarage, his plan would be disco∣vered,
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
if he had announced himself only as Mr. Warrington; and had he at once declared himself to be Sir George, the people of the inn could not be ignorant of what he wished to keep secret; simply forgetting the address on his letters from Mr. Thomson would at all events frus∣trate his plan.</P>
<P>All the circumstances Miss More∣land had related to Mrs. Edgeworth were exactly true; but it is not easy to give a just idea of the transport she felt, when that lady offered her an asylum, and she found it possible to be useful to her in the quality of governess: her tranquillity returned,
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
and her happiness increased every hour, as she every hour grew more attached to Mrs. Edgeworth and her amiable daughters. Of Mr. Edge∣worth she saw little but at meals: he was a mere sportsman, rough in his manners, and unfeeling almost to brutality: his behaviour to his wife and family was sufficient to give her a disgust to him, though to her, till the interview preceding their separa∣tion, he had always behaved with as much civility as he was capable of. Nothing interrupted the calm serenity of her life but a wish to know the name and address of her generous benefactor, that she might again express the gratitude she felt,
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
and inform him of the true reason why she had not availed herself of his benevolent offer, fearing, too just∣ly, he might accuse her of having acted with duplicity. Without be∣ing guilty of the weakness of falling in love at first sight, he had made some impression on her heart: she still retained his image in her mind, and, by comparing it with the gentle∣men who visited at Mr. Edgeworth's, it soon acquired an ideal superiority; for of his real character she could only know he was benevolent and humane, and this his conduct to∣wards her had fully proved.</P>
<P>The joy she felt on meeting him
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
at church was mingled with embar∣rassment, from her scarcely know∣ing how to begin her justification; and this gave her an appearance of guilt, the consciousness of which she was far from feeling: but the inso∣lent speech of Fidelia overthrew the little courage she had been struggling to obtain; and, before she could re∣cover, they had both left the church. Apprehension, though she knew not of what—disappointment, and mor∣tification, now completely subdued her; and, as the Miss Edgeworths had declared, when called on for their evidence, they could scarcely keep her from fainting during their ride home; and, arriving there, she reach∣ed
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
her chamber with difficulty. Ca∣roline Edgeworth, who loved her ten∣derly, gave her some drops, and staid with her till summoned to the par∣lour, whither she went with the less reluctance as Miss Moreland was considerably better. But this amend∣ment lasted not long: Mr. Edge∣worth in a few minutes entered her apartment, and, in a voice choked with rage, bade her leave his house, accusing her alternately of theft and imposture. It was in vain she de∣clared her innocence, and begged to know who had vilified her. He re∣plied sullenly, "It was no matter; but that thus far he would tell her— the gentleman she had seen at
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
church would swear before any ma∣gistrate in the kingdom, that she had robbed him of plate, money, and jewels, to a considerable amount; so she had best get off as fast as she could, for he would prosecute her wherever he found her."</P>
<P>"For Heaven's sake!" exclaimed the distracted Louisa, "tell me his name, that I may apply to him in person, and justify myself; for in∣deed, indeed, I am innocent; there is some terrible mistake in all this."</P>
<P>"No no," cried Mr. Edgeworth, "there is no mistake; he saw you himself, and could not say his pray∣ers
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
for thinking about it. As to his name, that's all a fetch—you know it as well as I do—so pack up your things and be off, d'ye hear, within this hour, or the constables will be after you. The carriage shall take you to —, and that's more than you deserve; but you had as good not stay there, I can tell you."</P>
<P>He then left the room, disregard∣ing her tears, and her entreaties that he would listen to her if but for a mo∣ment. The agony she was in for some time prevented her from taking any steps towards her removal; but terror at length overcame every other sensation, and she collected her little
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
wardrobe. Whilst locking her trunk, she heard the carriage drive to the door; and at that moment Caroline, entering the room on tiptoe as if afraid of being overheard, ran up to her, and, embracing her affectionate∣ly, gave her a paper.—"Mamma sends you this," cried she; "she must not come herself, but she wishes you well, and hopes you are inno∣cent; and, if not, that you will never be guilty again. I do not very well know what is the matter; but I am sure I am sorry to part with you."</P>
<P>"God bless you, my dear Caro∣line!" replied Louisa in broken ac∣cents. "Indeed I am guilty of no
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
crime, nor can I guess what I am ac∣cused of."</P>
<P>The footman now entered for her trunks, and Caroline, once more em∣bracing her, left the room sobbing violently; and Louisa, with extreme agitation, followed the servant down stairs, and, entering the carriage, in a short time arrived at the inn; but, fearful of remaining, ordered a post∣chaise, and in the mean time sat down to consider whither she should go, and what method she could take to avoid falling into the hands of her cruel persecutor—for such she now too justly esteemed our hero. On opening the paper given her by Ca∣roline,
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
she found it contained a twenty pound note; and this re∣moving some of her fears, by sup∣plying her with present support, she returned her warmest thanks to Hea∣ven for not abandoning her in this hour of distress, and then mental∣ly acknowledged Mrs. Edgeworth's kindness; and as she had several guineas already in her pocket, ap∣prehensive of a misfortune similar to that she had before experienced, she disposed of the note and three gui∣neas in a way not likely to be dis∣covered, by fastening them within the lining of her beaver hat: and then, believing she stood more in need of countenance and protection than
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
even on her first arrival in England, it occurred to her to go to the farm formerly occupied by her old nurse, and enquire whether she had any re∣lations now living, as their recom∣mendation might be useful to her, and she should probably want no∣thing else. Unlocking her box, she took out a parcel of Mrs. Garland's letters, to identify her if required, and resolved, when once made known to them, to change her name, that she might be concealed from the know∣ledge of our hero. Having settled this, her mind grew easier; and, when the chaise was ready, she or∣dered it to the next stage towards the northern road. But, on her arrival,
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
she grew so extremely ill as to be wholly unable to continue her jour∣ney; the agitation of her mind throw∣ing her into a fever, which lasted her several days: towards the latter end of the week she recovered, and, pur∣suing her first plan, about four o'clock on the Friday afternoon reached the place of her destination, having taken the name of Western, and affixed the same direction on her portmanteau.</P>
<P>She would not stop at the little inn where she had before met our hero: it revived too many painful recollections; but, ordering the man to drive to the end of the street nearest
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
the farm, she alighted, and, bidding him wait, walked through a meadow to the house. In her way she met a labourer, and enquiring the farmer's name, he said it was Johnson: she then asked if he was at home, and was answered in the affirmative. On this she walked on, and, repeating her question, was shewn by a girl into a very decent parlour, where the first object that struck her eyes was a piece of her own needle-work, framed and glazed, hanging over the chim∣ney, which she had sent her nurse when a girl about twelve years old. The recollection drew tears into her eyes, and, when the farmer entered, she could scarcely speak.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117"/>With a rustic bow he enquired her commands, and she replied, by asking if he had had possession of the farm ever since the death of the for∣mer tenant.</P>
<P>"Yes, Madam," answered he.</P>
<P>"Then perhaps you can inform me, whether farmer Garland or his wife left any near relations, and where they at present reside."</P>
<P>"She was my sister, Madam," re∣turned he; "but, excepting myself and a cousin or two, she left no kin∣dred at all."</P>
<P>Louisa now believed she traced a
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
distant resemblance; and, her tears still flowing—"Did you never," said she, "hear her speak of a little girl she suckled, Louisa Moreland?"</P>
<P>"Ay," cried he, "many a time and oft: 'twas she that worked that fine picture yonder, and poor Mary used to grieve so about her in her last illness, because she had heard nothing of her for a long time, and said she was among outlandish people and pa∣pishes; for Mary loved her like her own child."</P>
<P>Miss Moreland, quite subdued by this instance of tenderness, replied in a faltering voice—"I am that
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
Louisa; these letters (taking them from her pocket) will prove to you I am no impostor: that picture, as you say, was worked by my own hand; my name and age are at the back, with the date of the year."</P>
<P>"So it is, indeed," cried the far∣mer in much surprise; "you are young Madam Moreland, to be sure; but what, Miss, did you not know our Mary and her husband were dead?"</P>
<P>"Oh yes," returned she weeping, "I knew it too well; I learnt it some time since; and now you shall hear my business with you. I am in great
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
distress, but it is not for money; of that I have sufficient for my present support: but I have no where to go, no friend in the world; and I am too young, too unprotected, to live by myself. If you have a wife and fa∣mily, let me board with you for a short time, till I can form some plan for my future subsistence: perhaps even in that respect you can assist me, by recommending me to a place where I may gain a decent living. I ask only your protection."</P>
<P>She paused, impatiently expecting his reply: he was silent for some mi∣nutes: at last, "I am very sorry, Miss," said he, "for your misfor∣tunes,
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
and wish I was able to do as you would have me; but, to tell you the truth, the grey mare is the better horse here, and my wife won't ap∣prove of your living with us, and that: besides, we have no gentry here∣about, where you could go to ser∣vice; being as they're all single men, as comes down once or twice a year a-hunting and shooting and the like, with their fine Misses and Madams: but now I think on't, you ben't so friendless as you do believe; for 'twas but last Tuesday night a gentleman's sarvent was enquiring for you; and when I said my sister as nursed you was dead, and that you had never been here, the footman said, 'his
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
master would be so sorry, he did not like to go back with such bad news."</P>
<P>Louisa trembled. "Will that merciless man," exclaimed she, "ne∣ver cease to persecute me! Tell me, my good friend, whose servant it was?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Miss, I never thought to ax, not expecting to see you here; but never fear—he'll come again, I warrant him —for he said his master would never rest till he had found you."</P>
<P>"Good Heaven!" cried she, "what will then become of me! Where shall
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
I go for safety and protection! — for here I must not stay, even if they would permit me."</P>
<P>The good farmer was much moved by her distress, though believing it only arose from his refusing her an asylum. "I'll tell you what I can do, Miss," said he; "you shall bide here for a fortnight; and then I'm a-go∣ing farther down the country a good way to arrest a man that owes me for a matter of fifty head of oxen: now I shall not be far from a cousin of mine and poor Mary's, that lives in a very sober family as housekeeper: now I'll take you to her behind me, if so be as you can ride double; and
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
she is such a good woman, I am sure she will take care of you for Mary's sake."</P>
<P>Louisa joyfully accepted an offer in many respects so eligible, and which would, as she hoped, convey her far from those she had most rea∣son to fear; and was received by Mrs. Johnson with tolerable civility. The farmer himself, at her request, undertook to discharge the chaise and take care of her trunks. She passed the fortnight with more tranquillity than she expected, though not with∣out many fears that the footman farmer Johnson had spoken of would return; and on the appointed day,
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
tying up a few necessaries in a bundle, and equipping herself as properly as she could for her new expedition, she set out behind the farmer, leaving her clothes to be forwarded if her appli∣cation succeeded. Here then for a while let us leave Louisa and return to our hero.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Sir George arose in the morning, it occurred to him that James Bever, being well acquainted with the person of Louisa, might be employed in searching for her dur∣ing his stay in town; and now, for the first time, imparted to him all that had passed, lamented his own credulity, and execrated the baseness of the younger Wilmots, yet cau∣tioned him against mentioning their names. James heard him with grief and astonishment, and, forgetting
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
his master had only seen her for a few hours, wondered he could possibly believe she was guilty of such de∣praved conduct; but he saw how deeply he suffered already, and avoid∣ed saying any thing that might add to his distress.</P>
<P>The first hope of Sir George was to trace her through the means of the postillion who had driven her from the inn he was now at, as Mrs. Edgeworth, to assist his enquiries, had informed him her carriage had conveyed her there; but this hope was vain. The landlord recollected the circumstance instantly, but said "the man had since left his service, and
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
was gone he knew not whither." All that could now be done was to enquire at the next stage every way. This was a work of time: James Bever, however, gladly undertook it, hoping to restore the amiable Louisa; and, promising to write to our hero at Lord Milbanke's if any fortunate event occurred, he set out at the same moment that our hero got into the carriage that was to convey him to London.</P>
<P>He proceeded instantly to Lord Milbanke's, and, fortunately finding them without company, related every occurrence respecting Miss More∣land that had come to his know∣ledge;
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
candidly confessing the part he had acted, at the same time excus∣ing himself by shewing the letter of Mr. Thomson, which, as he knew not of the robbery, was a testimony not to be doubted. The affliction of Lady Milbanke was evident and sin∣cere; and his Lordship, though he had not the same reason, was deeply concerned at the relation, and the dread of what Louisa's sufferings might be in future, forlorn and un∣protected as she was. He promised our hero to join him in every exertion for her restoration, and hoped much from James Bever, who was not only a well-principled diligent fellow, but particularly anxious for the fate of
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
Miss Moreland, from having once been instrumental to her preserva∣tion.</P>
<P>The following morning, the gen∣tlemen set out on the expedition in which, next to regaining Louisa, they were most interested. This was to solve the apparent enigma of the rob∣bery; and for this purpose they went to the pawnbroker's, and, threatening him with a prosecution for receiv∣ing stolen goods if he did not con∣fess from whom he had those articles he formerly resigned to our hero, he instantly complied; and giving them a direction to Kitty Harris in the Seven Dials, they went immediately
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
in search of her. On arriving at the house, they were sent up stairs by a woman in the shop; and, entering a miserable apartment, found the ob∣ject of their enquiry the victim of sickness and poverty, and so situ∣ated as in their humane hearts pre∣cluded all idea of revenge. On their opening the door, she lifted up her languid head, and, in a voice scarcely audible, demanded their business. Our hero was too much shocked to reply; but Lord Milbanke, whose longer acquaintance with the world had rendered these scenes less strange to him, asked "if she was the young woman who at Warrington had taken the name of Moreland?" She looked
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
terrified at this question; which our hero perceiving, told her, in a mild accent, "she had nothing to fear; they only begged she would relate all she knew of the circumstance he al∣luded to." With still greater con∣fusion she promised to comply; but her voice failed through mere weak∣ness, and she then assured him she had not tasted food that day. On hearing this, Lord Milbanke, fearing she would not be able to go through with the story, ran down stairs, and dispatched a boy from the shop to the next tavern for a bottle of wine and a cold chicken. When he returned, she took a little of the latter, and drank a glass of wine, and, appear∣ing
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
much revived, instantly began her narrative; but, as we are better acquainted with some of the facts than she was herself, we beg leave to give it in our own words.</P>
<P>Kitty Harris was the daughter of an inferior tradesman in the Bo∣rough; but the ambition of her fa∣ther and the vanity of her mother inducing them to send her to a more eminent school than she had any right to be educated at, she imbibed higher ideas, and cherished higher hopes, than she had any prospect of gratifying, though in person she was really pretty and rather genteel. Her parents, on her return, saw their
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
error, but knew not how to remedy it. Kitty now wanted finer clothes than they had any means of supply∣ing her with, and languished for amusements she was far removed from. When they wanted her to stand behind the counter, she sullenly refused; and, when they threatened her with punishment, replied, "she would run away from them;" but of this they had no fear, well assured she had no where to run to. But this was not the case long. To obtain finery was now her sole object; and, to en∣able her to purchase it, she made no scruple of robbing her father's till from time to time of such small sums as might not be missed. This led
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
her to still greater crimes, as it en∣abled her to dress, and afford the expence of public places; and a com∣panion was only wanting; for she well knew her father and mother would not let her go alone. With∣out much difficulty she made a friend∣ship with a young woman who lodg∣ed in the same street, whose nominal profession was a mantua-maker. With her she passed most of her time, and with her went to the plays, and such places as her pocket would af∣ford; and at them increased her ac∣quaintance considerably. The gra∣dations of vice are at first scarcely perceptible; but its consequences are dreadful and certain. Kitty Harris
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
soon formed a connection with a young apprentice; and influenced by the example of her companion, the regularity of her father's house be∣came irksome, and she consented to elope with him. He placed her in a small lodging in Oxford-street; and, thus far removed, there was little probability of her parents tracing her; and for some time she lived in comparative affluence. But this soon ended: the young man was recalled to the country by his friends; and taking a French leave of Kitty, she was deeply involved in distress and poverty, ashamed to return to her abandoned home, yet afraid of the horrors of a prison, as the mistress of
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
the house threatened to arrest her for the rent. This, however, she es∣caped; and, meeting with another pro∣tector, who was journeyman in a ca∣pital warehouse, was again lifted to a situation similar to that she had been in before. But whether in poverty or affluence, the native depravity of her principles never suffered her to be inactive; and she was only guilty of petty thefts, because, though her genius led her to higher crimes, for∣tune had not yet given her an oppor∣tunity to exert it.</P>
<P>It happened, as it usually does happen, that her keeper, unable ho∣nestly to support the expence of a
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
mistress and a couple of horses, took the liberty of applying to his master's till; and this being at length suspect∣ed, he was discarded with ignominy. But as no positive proof appeared, he for this time escaped the punish∣ment he merited; and, being deprived of all other means of support, took to the highway, where he gained a precarious livelihood; but, fearing a discovery if he constantly frequented the same places, he set out with two or three more on a country expedi∣tion. They picked up among them a capital sum, and, then dispersing, took different roads to London.</P>
<P>This young man, after riding all
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
night, came in about six in the morn∣ing to the little public-house where our hero met Miss Moreland; and waiting till his horse was rested and he had taken some breakfast, being too far removed from the scene of his depredations even to fear suspicion, he overheard the conversation that passed between them, and witnessed (for the door was a-jar) the gift of the pocket-book, and learnt its contents. A capital prize was now in view, and he determined it should not escape him. He called for his horse, and, waiting to hear which way the car∣riage was ordered, set out soon after, and, purposely riding slow, would not overtake it till he had reached a spot
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
conveniently lonely for his purpose. The robbery was effected without any trouble, for the terrified Louisa yielded it up without remonstrance; and he rode off highly satisfied with his expedition.</P>
<P>On his arrival at London, which was not immediately, as he staid some little time on the road, he flew to Kitty's lodgings, related all his suc∣cess, flung a few guineas into her lap, and, opening the pocket-book, took out the bank-note and secured it; broke the seal of the letter, and, finding it contained nothing of value, threw it on the fire; but the pocket∣book itself, which was very hand∣some,
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
having a gold lock and silver instruments, he also presented to Kitty; and, then rising, said 'he must meet his old friends at the usual place, as he had promised.'</P>
<P>The curiosity of woman never sleeps. When he was gone, she took the letter from the fire, which for∣tunately was almost out, and it had received no injury except a little dust, and began perusing it. When she had finished, the possibility of per∣sonating Miss Moreland occurred to her; and she determined to attempt it, allured by the hopes of gain, as the injunction to Mr. Thomson to supply Louisa with any sums she
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
might require induced her to believe it might be a profitable journey; and the intended absence of Sir George afforded her a sufficient time to com∣plete her plans. On looking at the date, she saw only a few days had elapsed, and resolved instantly to put her scheme in execution, and that without saying a word to any one. The next morning, therefore, leav∣ing a message with her landlady that she was gone into the country for a day or two, she set out in one of the northern coaches, and arrived at Mr. Thomson's in safety, giving him as a reason for not being there accord∣ing to the date of the letter, that
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
she had been detained on the road by illness, which had consumed the lit∣tle pittance bestowed by Sir George.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Thomson gave implicit belief to this account, ex∣erted themselves for her comfort and accommodation, and introduced her to all the friends of Sir George, by whom she was received with particu∣lar civility, though not with particu∣lar satisfaction. Miss Kettering, hav∣ing lost all hopes of the Baronet, at∣tached herself to the pretended Lou∣isa, wishing to form a lasting inti∣macy; since, next to being Lady Warrington herself, to be Lady War∣rington's
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
chosen friend was the step now to be obtained; and this wish actuated many others.</P>
<P>Till I knew the world as well as I do at present, it was sometimes a sub∣ject of wonder to me, considering the envy and jealousy that too often per∣vade the bosoms of the fairer sex, that young ladies, apparently neglect∣ing their own interest, attended sole∣ly to that of their acquaintance: but the mystery was soon developed: to be the friend of the Duchess, Mar∣chioness, or Countess, is a much easier attainment than to be Duchess, Marchioness, or Countess, yourself; and perhaps the kind friend whom
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
you may have assisted may assist you in turn, though in an humbler pursuit.</P>
<P>Kitty now endeavoured to recol∣lect and practise all the refinement she had learned at the boarding-school: but in vain; for she had since imbibed much coarseness of manner, and could not wholly check it, though she did in part; and, as∣suming a great degree of vivacity, concealed from most of the inha∣bitants of Bellingham the natural vulgarity of her language and ad∣dress. But Miss Carruther, edu∣cated in real high life, and having lived so long among really fashion∣able
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
people, was not to be deceived. She thought it strange; but endea∣voured to persuade herself it was in Miss Moreland the effects of a con∣vent education, and the want of knowing English customs; for Kitty, by finding out Miss Carruther's weak side, and accommodating herself to her foibles, was become a peculiar favourite. In conversation she al∣ways addressed her in this way— "Emily, my dear girl, how good you are to a forlorn stranger like me:" and this appellation, "dear girl," was very liberally bestowed by the artful impostor; and it succeeded but too well, as the reader is already in∣formed: therefore to dwell longer on
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
these circumstances would be unne∣cessary.</P>
<P>When Mr. Thomson, in the good∣ness of his heart, mentioned the re∣turn of the Saxbys, whose servants, he suppossed from the contents of Sir George's letter, she would be so hap∣py to see, she was panic-struck by the apprehension of discovery, and determined to leave the country with whatever she could pick up; but before this scheme was put into exe∣cution, she was told Mrs. Saxby had discharged both James and Lucy for the assistance they had afforded her; and this, by renewing her hopes, induced her to alter her plan.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148"/>A few days after this, she met Mr. Saxby accidentally. He had learned she was in the country, and introduced himself by apologizing for the conduct of his wife, and hinted a wish that she had claimed his protection instead of his servants, "as he should have been happy in devoting his future life to her.'</P>
<P>She replied, with extreme cour∣tesy, that "even now his protection would not be unacceptable;" and he was too gallant not to take a hint so fairly given. In short, a few meet∣ings more settled their scheme; and it was agreed he should meet her on the road from Sir William Arling∣ton's,
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
and take her to London. This was effected as has been already described, and they set off together; but their harmony was not of long continuance. Mr. Saxby detected her in an attempt to secure his purse, and discarded her with the ignominy she merited. Kitty then returned to her former lodgings, and, enquir∣ing for her old lover, learned he was apprehended for a burglary which he had committed during her coun∣try excursion, and it was supposed he would be condemned. Distracted at this information, she flew to the prison, and, disposing of all her ill∣gotten treasure to the pawnbroker, who gave her a trifle compared to
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
their real value, promising a far∣ther sum when they were sold, she gave it to her unfortunate lover, to secure, if possible, his safety. In the mean time Sir George visited the pawnbroker, and she was glad to accept the ten guineas, lest her life also should be endangered. But this as well as the rest of the money she could raise was ineffectual: her lover was brought in guilty, and soon after suffered the punishment so justly his due. Kitty then, having disposed even of her wearing apparel to pro∣cure him the few indulgencies he re∣quired, fell into poverty and sick∣ness; for her constitution, weakened by dissipation and her attendance
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
on him, could not resist the attacks of a slow fever, under which she was sinking when Lord Milbanke and our hero paid her this apparently un∣welcome visit.</P>
<P>Except palliating a few circum∣stances and excusing others, she re∣lated the above history with tolerable precision; and Sir George, far from prosecuting his intended revenge, now only thought how he might re∣lieve her. He drew out his purse, and, cautioning her against a relapse into vice (for she prosessed herself a sincere penitent), gave her sufficient for her present exigencies. Lord Milbanke then asked a direction to
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
her parents, and enquired if she would return to them? "They will not re∣ceive me, I fear," replied she, her eyes streaming with tears. "That we will enquire," returned Lord Mil∣banke, greatly affected; "and, if successful, you shall hear from us again tomorrow." She endeavoured to express her thanks: but her voice failed; and, before she could articu∣late, they had left the room.</P>
<P>They went directly to the Borough; and painting the scene they had wit∣nessed in the most pathetic colours to Mr. Harris and his wife, they consented to receive their miserable child; and when resentment for her
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
crimes had subsided, parental ten∣derness overcame them, and they would have gone to her instantly: but this Lord Milbanke would not permit; he said, "in her state of health, such a surprise might be fa∣tal; but he would prepare her to re∣ceive them the following morning." He then gently hinted, that all her errors were originally the effects of an education improper for her sta∣tion in life: to this they assented, and promised to atone for it by every effort in their power, to restore their unhappy child to health, to virtue, and consequently to happiness.</P>
<P>On leaving the Borough, they went
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
once more to the poor girl, and in∣formed her that the next day she might expect her parents, who had promised not only to receive but for∣give her; and then entreated she would cautiously avoid the slightest temptations to vice, and persevere in a strict penitence. In a transport of gratitude she fell on her knees, and, after thanking them for recon∣ciling her to her father and mother, declared, in the most solemn manner, "she would strictly adhere to their ad∣vice," assuring them that "the miser∣able and untimely end of the man with whom she had lived so long had its proper effect on her mind,
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
by proving the folly as well as the danger of unprincipled conduct."</P>
<P>They now left her, and had the following day the satisfaction of hear∣ing she was removed home with less difficulty than from her weak state could have been expected; and our hero, inclosing a bank-note, wrote a few lines to the father, desiring it might be appropriated to procuring her every assistance her melancholy situation required. He thus acquit∣ted his conscience with respect to Kitty Harris, who certainly deserved not so much attention, if the rules of justice were only to be considered;
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
but Sir George Warrington always remembered,
<Q><L>The quality of mercy is not strain'd;</L>
<L>It droppeth like the gentle rain from Heaven,</L>
<L>Upon the place beneath:</L></Q>
And his own bosom proved,
<Q><L>It is twice blest:</L>
<L>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero now meant to devote every hour to the search for Louisa, in which Lord Milbanke intended to assist; but their plan was frustrated by a letter from Mr. Thomson, in∣forming him that his steward was dangerously ill, and wished if pos∣sible to see him before his end, to resign all his accounts into his own hands. This request, though it came very mal à-propos, Sir George resolved instantly to comply with; and, taking a hasty leave of his uncle
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
and aunt, set out the same day: but, on his arrival late in the evening, heard Mr. Wharton was so much re∣covered as to be out of danger; the gout, which had been flying from his head to his stomach, being now set∣tled into a regular fit. He would not, therefore, visit him that night; but the next morning went to his house, which was situated in the park, and, after staying with him a short time, proceeded to Mr. Thomson's, with whom he spent the remainder of the day, conversing on past events, and mutually regretting the impo∣sition that had been practised, since the consequences were so unfortu∣nate. But the good Vicar sincerely
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
rejoiced to see his young friend so much improved in mind and person, and to learn from himself, that his understanding was cleared from those errors which had overclouded it when they parted. Indeed his im∣provement in every respect was too visible to escape notice. An ac∣quaintance with the fashionable world, the society of informed and polished men, of amiable and ele∣gant women, had given a dignity to his own manners and address, and a refinement to his language and con∣versation, that had been only want∣ing to render him a complete gentle∣man; and Mr. Thomson had now the satisfaction of beholding him all
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
he wished. His attachment to the beautiful Miss Moreland had also contributed its share to this altera∣tion in our hero: perhaps, indeed, love alone might have effected it; and Louisa, like Iphigenia, without any foreign aid might have polished this rustic Cymon—"a swain" (for he was not a clown) "who never dreamt of love."</P>
<P>When our hero returned home, about eleven o'clock at night, the conversation of the day had so strong∣ly impressed the image of Louisa on his mind, that, certain he could not rest till his thoughts had taken ano∣ther turn, he dismissed the servant
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
who attended him, saying "he should read for an hour or two," and bade the man go to bed. On opening a book that lay on the table, he found it was not congenial to his present sentiments, and resolved to look for another. No other, however, was in his apartment; and, taking up the candle, he walked slowly and silently along the gallery, at the other end of which was the library, lest he should disturb the family, who he imagined were all quiet. But a faint light flashing across at a distance convinced him he was mistaken. On approaching nearer, he saw it pro∣ceeded from the study-door, which was half open; and, on looking in,
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
saw a tall figure in white, with a light in her hand, at the farther end of the room, taking down a book from one of the higher shelves. He was startled, but not terrified, at this appearance, well convinced it was none of his own family: but what were his emotions when, on her turn∣ing half round, he discovered his long lost, long regretted Louisa! Surprise for a moment totally over∣came him; he disbelieved the evidence of his senses, and almost imagined that the wildness of his fancy had raised an illusive form to cheat him into momentary happiness. But an∣xious for conviction, and forgetting the place, the hour, and the terror
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
he must excite, he threw open the door, and, flying towards her, caught her in his arms, exclaiming—"Have I then found you, most beloved, most adored of women!" He could say no more: a loud scream from Louisa at once convinced him of the folly of his conduct; and she fell senseless at his feet. The alarm brought Mrs. Newel the house∣keeper from her apartment; and, ter∣rified at the appearance of her mas∣ter and the situation of Miss More∣land, she summoned the other ser∣vants, and, calling for drops, endea∣voured to restore her to life; but in vain: her disorder resisted all the efforts of medicine; and our hero
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
walked the apartment in an agony of grief and despair. After repeated applications, she shewed some signs of returning sense, and in the same degree Sir George found his hopes revive.</P>
<P>When tolerably recovered, he gen∣tly approached her; but on his at∣tempting to speak, he was interrupt∣ed by her addressing him with a mix∣ture of apprehension and dignity— "Why, Sir, do you thus persecute a defenceless and unhappy being, who is not conscious of having ever offended you? You have already driven me from one secure asylum, and deprived me of the only friend
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
the whole world afforded me. Do not again force me to seek another refuge; at least tell me what it is you accuse me of—inform me how I have injured you?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Newel's surprise was ex∣treme: she thought the fright had deprived her of reason; but Sir George's answer calmed her terror. He threw himself at Louisa's feet, and besought her to hear him.</P>
<P>"You have," said he, "indeed been cruelly treated, but believe me I was innocent: it was the Miss Wil∣mots who, under the mask of jus∣tice and benevolence, vilified you to
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
Mrs. Edgeworth: but she as well as myself is now undeceived; and if, Miss Moreland, you can condescend to forgive a man who has been un∣designedly the cause of your misfor∣tunes, my future life shall be de∣voted to proving the sincerity of my repentance, and the extent of my gratitude."</P>
<P>Miss Moreland's astonishment was extreme, and her anxiety to under∣stand his meaning was no less: but it was too late for an explanation that night: he promised in the morn∣ing to relate every thing, but en∣treated she would then retire, as he saw her spirits were still too much
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
agitated to bear any farther conver∣sation. She complied with his re∣quest, and, attended by Mrs. Newel, went to her apartment. Sir George also returned to his, but was unable for some time to compose himself.</P>
<P>Let me now account to my rea∣ders for the unexpected appearance of Louisa at Warrington Castle.</P>
<P>During her journey with farmer Johnson, she entreated she might be introduced to his relation by the name of Western; alleging she had very strong reasons for wishing to be unknown; and with this request he complied. On his arrival at War∣rington
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
Castle, where his cousin was housekeeper, he related all he knew of her story—said "she had been suckled by his sister, but had not a friend in all England"—and begged her protection for a time, and that she would, if possible, recommend her to some way of life where she might gain an honest livelihood. This was the sum of the good farmer's speech to Mrs. Newel, whilst the trembling Louisa waited in the park to hear what her recep∣tion would be. Indeed it was every thing she wished: Mrs. Newel came out, and, begging her to walk in, as∣sured her of every attention in her power to bestow; and added, as her
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
master was now absent, and not like∣ly to return for a long time, she was mistress of the Castle and all it con∣tained.</P>
<P>This intelligence was very agree∣able to Miss Moreland, who would not have liked to be the inmate of a large family; and farmer Johnson had the satisfaction of leaving her well, and happily settled with his benevolent relation, who grew every hour more attached to her young guest: but her spirits, so long ha∣rassed by alarm and anxiety, now at once gave way, and she was seized with a violent nervous fever, which obliged her to apply to physical ad∣vice.
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
Mrs. Newel attended her with the utmost kindness; and she was only just recovering when the illness of the steward occasioned the return of Sir George. This circumstance the housekeeper carefully concealed, knowing it would distress her; and as she slept in a chamber looking into the garden, and had yet only left it to go into the study, which it joined, she thought she might keep it a secret for some days at least. Had Louisa been accused of any thing but absolute fraud, she would have told every circumstance to her kind friend; but, as it was, cautiously avoided the subject, as she could only deny, not disprove, the fact; and
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
there was something so degrading even in the suspicion, she could not bear to avow it. Or had Mrs. Newel been of the common character of housekeepers, and given her an ac∣count of the imposition so success∣fully carried on at Mr. Thomson's, the whole mystery would have been at once revealed; but, as this was not the case, they each remained in utter ignorance.</P>
<P>On the evening this important dis∣covery was made, Louisa, finding herself disinclined to sleep, went in∣to the library, from the same motive that brought Sir George. What passed in consequence of their meet∣ing
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
has been already related; but when Louisa retired with Mrs. Newel, the latter, who had heard Sir George address her by the name of Moreland, could no longer conceal her knowledge of the events which so lately occurred at Warrington, and instantly related all that had pass∣ed at the vicarage to the astonished Louisa, who now understood why she had been so unjustly accused, and of what. In return she confessed to Mrs. Newel the whole of her history; and the good woman sympathized in her troubles, and rejoiced they were now at an end.</P>
<P>The next morning, when our hero
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
and Miss Moreland met, an entire explanation ensued; and Sir George informed her that she had a tender and expecting relation, who would afford her the protection she wished for, but he added a slight hint of the hopes he had ventured to indulge, which, he said, "he knew Lord and Lady Milbanke would endeavour to strengthen." When their conversa∣tion was at an end, he flew to the vicarage; but Mr. Thomson and his wife were already acquainted with the happy discovery through the means of a servant, who was impa∣tient to be the first to tell the news, as he called it, of the right Miss Moreland's being come to Warring∣ton
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
at last. Mrs. Thomson now anticipated his wishes, and invited Louisa to stay at their house till she was well enough to attend her aunt. This invitation she readily accepted; and Sir George, conscious she could not remain with propriety under his own roof, was well pleased at her being in a family where he might be a constant as he was always a wel∣come guest, and could avail him∣self of every opportunity to obtain an interest in her affections.</P>
<P>His next step after her removal was to write to Lord Milbanke, Mrs. Edgeworth, and Captain Mon∣tague. The former answered his
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
letter in person. Lady Milbanke had been confined with a slight fever, and could not accompany him; but he was charged not to return with∣out her niece, if she was well enough to bear the journey: and her health being now re-established, she pre∣pared to attend him. Mr. and Mrs. Thomson could not part from her without great reluctance, as from her society they had received as much pleasure, as they had expe∣rienced pain from the visit of their late unprincipled guest. But they were consoled by a well-founded hope, that it would not be very long before she would return in the cha∣racter of Lady Warrington.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176"/>This important discovery soon reached Bellingham; and those fa∣milies in particular who had coun∣tenanced the pretended were now impatient to know the real Miss Moreland: but her late illness and naturally retired disposition pre∣vented the indulgence of their wishes. But Mr. Kettering, purposely making a visit to the good Vicar, was for∣tunate enough to see her; and the report he carried back of her ex∣treme beauty and elegance was by some disbelieved, by others unwil∣lingly credited; but the young la∣dies were singly and unitedly of opinion, that, if she were as hand∣some as possible, Sir George might
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
have had a wife as beautiful and accomplished without going so far from home.</P>

<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AS those events of the life of Sir George Warrington which I have taken upon me to relate are drawing to∣wards a conclusion, I have little more to say on the subject. Louisa ex∣perienced a most affectionate recep∣tion from her aunt, and found in Lord Milbanke's family so happy an asylum, she could not have wish∣ed to change it for another, had not the merit of our hero in due time had its proper effect on a heart which was not an insensible one;
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
and she acknowledged, with a frank∣ness that did her honour, he was the only man for whom she had ever felt the slightest degree of preference, and that her esteem and affection for him were decided and sincere.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this confession, Sir George began every preparation on his side, and Lady Milbanke took care her niece should be in readiness for the happy day that was to unite them. In the midst of this bustle, Lucy Clerke was not forgotten: she was easily traced to her aunt's, and Sir George bestowed on her a boun∣tiful reward for her attention to his beloved Louisa, and engaged her as
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
Lady Warrington's future atten∣dant.</P>
<P>James Bever returned to Portman-square, from his unsuccessful search, just after Lord Milbanke had received the joyful intelligence, and attended him to Warrington. The unfeigned joy with which both James and Lucy met her, on whom they had for∣merly bestowed such an almost unre∣turnable obligation, could only be equalled by the gratitude she ex∣pressed. Indeed this testimony of her merit would have been a suffi∣cient evidence in her favour; but her virtues were now not only conspi∣cuous but acknowledged. She did
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
not in her prosperity forget any of those who in distress had soothed, and in adversity supported her. To Mrs. Edgeworth she wrote a very grateful and affectionate letter, accompanied by a present for the children equally valuable and elegant. To farmer Johnson's family she also sent such things as were at once useful and suitable to their station in life.</P>
<P>The Savilles were at this time in town; and Sir George had great pleasure in introducing them to his esteemed relations, and his beloved Louisa, for whom they had long felt a particular interest. They inform∣ed him Mr. Wilmot had consented
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
without hesitation to bestow his el∣dest daughter on Captain Montague, and that Rosetta and Fidelia met with the universal contempt they me∣rited.</P>
<P>Their society was soon rendered complete by the arrival of Myrtilla, who was in a few weeks to give her hand to the Captain. Miss Wilmot and Louisa were too equally amiable not to esteem each other warmly; and the former expressing a wish to reside in the neighbourhood of War∣rington, Sir George with much plea∣sure informed Montague of a house at that time vacant in his neigh∣bourhood. Mrs. Saxby had so high∣ly
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
resented her husband's conduct with respect to Kitty Harris, that a vio∣lent quarrel ensued, which ended in a separation. He chose to fix in the metropolis, and the lady to live any where but at Barclay Manor, where she had rendered herself an object of contempt and ridicule. Of course it was to be let; and Captain Montague, without hesitation, immediately en∣gaged it.</P>
<P>Kitty Harris lingered a few weeks, and then expired a sincere penitent. Her parents at first lamented her untimely fate, but were at length re∣conciled by the reflection that she was not cut off in haste, but had
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
leisure to repent of her past crimes; and they humbly hoped her penitence would be accepted.</P>
<P>The same day witnessed the union of Captain Montague and Myrtilla Wilmot, of Sir George Warrington and Louisa Moreland; and the sun never rose on four people more de∣serving of every blessing this world can afford. The sincere yet ardent passion of Sir George is well repaid by the real and tender affection of Louisa, who, from having been so long tossed by the tempests of life, is now more deeply and more gratefully sensible of the unclouded prospect around her, and more thankful to
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
that Being, who preserved her in in∣numerable dangers, and has at length bestowed on her as unmixed felicity as in this life we ever dare hope for or expect.</P>
