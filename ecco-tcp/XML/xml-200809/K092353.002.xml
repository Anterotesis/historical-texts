<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. Mr. PRESTON to Miss NANCY BLISSET.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 24, 1742-3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN this Letter I shall give you some Remarks on only one Book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> namely, the Seventh.</P>
<P>Verse 21 and 22, contain a very just Observation on the Temper of a Mob,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
and that too perhaps, in all Countries and all Ages.</P>
<P>Is the Epithet <HI>rude,</HI> which is applied to the <HI>Phoeacians,</HI> Verse 55, entirely re∣concileable to the Character given of them at Verse 12, in the last Book?</P>
<P>From Verse 110 to 175, is a most charming Description of the Palace and Garden of <HI>Alcinous.</HI> Does it not appear to you that <HI>Ovid</HI> has borrowed the De∣scription of the <HI>Palace of the Sun,</HI> in the second Book of his <HI>Metamorphoses,</HI> from this Place?</P>
<P>Verse 224. Here is a Passage very ex∣pressive of that Hospitality you have re∣marked and admired so much.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>From Verse 265 to 275, we have a great Resemblance to the Holy Scrip∣tures. One of the Apostles commands us <Q>to relieve Strangers, in-as-much as such have entertained Angels.</Q> We see it was so with <HI>Lot, Abraham, Ja∣cob,</HI> &amp;c. and further it is said, that <HI>God</HI> conversed with <HI>Moses,</HI> Face to Face, as a Man does with his Friend.</P>
<P>At Verse 295, are the two Lines with which the Critics have found great Fault in the Translation, as being too mean. The Expression, "craving Bowels," is rather beneath Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s usual Style.
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>370.</HI></BIBL> All Night I slept <HI>oblivious</HI> of my Care.</Q>
Methinks <HI>forgetful</HI> of my Care, would, from its Simplicity, have suited the Sub∣ject better.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>I have done with this Book, so shall release you from Criticisms at present, and change to another Subject, in which I would recommend a little of that Hos∣pitality we so admire in the Antients. I desire, nay insist, that you will prepare a little <HI>genial Board</HI> for your Birth-Day, as I shall do. Invite your Mama, your Aunt, and any other Friend you like; and I beg you will not suffer any thing to be abridged, on this Occasion, to save a few Shillings. I know your Turn for Oeconomy, but remit the Strictness of it for once. Besides the Pleasure it brings, it may answer some useful Ends. It will give you an Opportunity to shew your own Address, as Mistress of the Feast, display your Respect to your Pa∣rents in an amiable Light, and, at the
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
same Time, gratify your affectionate Sen∣sations. I am a Friend to little Indul∣gencies of this Kind, when confined within proper Restrictions, and not too often repeated. Thus directed, they come within the Compass of Virtue, other∣wise they extend to Profusion.</P>
<P>Pray do as I desire; so wishing you many happy Birth-Days,</P>

<SALUTE>My Dearest,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope this will be delivered into your Hands to-morrow, being your Birth-Day, when you are with your Friends, or preparing to be with them. I wish you many such Days, and that they may be happy. Give my humble Service to all that are with you when this comes to Hand, or that are to be with you in the Evening.</P>
<P>I went to the Inn myself yesternight, and gave Mrs. <HI>Bew</HI> very peremptory Di∣rections about your Box, so I hope you will receive it safe.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>You are now entering into a new Year of your Life. The best Advice I can give you, is to be thankful to God for the past, and shew your Gratitude by using the coming Year well. As you are going to be chearful with your Friends, I will not detain you long.</P>
<P>You have read of <HI>Pacolet</HI>'s wooden Horse, who, on turning a Pin, flew through the Air with his Rider, and went a great Journey in a few Moments. I could wish for such an Horse to-morrow Night, and after spending four or five Hours with you, to mount and come back here; but as such a Wish is vain, I must even be content to want that Pleasure, and within two or three Weeks make use of a wooden Coach, instead of
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
a wooden Horse, and travel over Land, instead of flying through the Air.</P>
<P>I hope you will spare so much Time to-morrow Evening as to write me, if it is no more than two or three Lines; and in the next Letter after that, I must have the History of this Evening, your Birth-Day, and Sunday. Salute your your Mama, Aunt, and Mrs. M—, with a Kiss for me. Again I wish you a haypy Birth-Day, and many more; and am, my dear Ange,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your most sincere Friend, and Servant, JOHN PRESTON.</SIGNED>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JUST now I received yours of the 29th, and was about to be much surprized that you was so long in answering all the Letters I wrote you last Week. I was
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
suddenly taken ill on your Birth-Day, and though I had engaged myself to pass the Evening at a Gentleman's Chambers in <HI>Baliol College,</HI> yet I could not sup, but after drinking your Health, and two or three sparing Glasses more, I was forced to quit the Company and return home. I kept my Bed two Days, and have not been out since. Though somewhat better now, I still continue ill. Pray write me soon again, and let me know how your Mama does. I shall be sure to acquaint you how I am. I dare not venture to write farther; it is with Pain I have written this.</P>
<P>I have made Remarks on the eighth <HI>Odyssey,</HI> but must defer them till my next.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>My Spirits are low. Your Letters cheer, as well as delight me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVIII.</HEAD>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM not yet quite recovered, and have been out but once, to wit, this Day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Probably Easter Sunday.</NOTE>, to Chapel, it being a high Festival, and the Sacrament administered.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>I am mightily pleased with your Ob∣servations on <HI>Rochefaucault.</HI> I shall make some few Remarks here on the 8th and 9th <HI>Odyssey,</HI> if I can get through them; but I am doubtful of my Abi∣lity, as I yet cannot endure much Ap∣plication.</P>
<P>From the Beginning of the 8th Book, we find the great Duties that were most highly esteemed in antient Times, were Prayer, Praises, Hospitality, and Sacri∣fices, attended with Music.</P>
<P>Though the Resentment of <HI>Ulysses</HI> at Verse 183, is very just, yet surely he car∣ries it too far.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> mentions the Opening of the 9th Book to have given great Joy to the
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Critics, who wished to find Fault with so great an Author. I wonder what provoked them. <HI>Ulysses</HI> only animad∣verts on the happy State of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> which is extremely just, and by no Means inconsistent with Virtue. To me there∣fore all Apologies to soften the Matter are entirely useless.</P>
<P>Verse 46. Quaere, what is meant by the Expression, <HI>a like Reward?</HI></P>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>189.</HI></BIBL> We sate indulging in the genial Rite.</Q>
<P>I am at a Loss to know why the Translator makes use of this Expression here, the <HI>genial Rite.</HI></P>
<P>The Speech of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to <HI>Polypheme,</HI> be∣ginning at Verse 307, is excellent. The last eight Lines are beautifully translated,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
and the Matter of them highly pious and instructive.</P>
<P>Verse 495. I think all this <HI>fort outrée,</HI> notwithstanding all that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has said to make it pass; as well as the whole Story of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Noman.</HI></P>
<P>By all Means let me know how your Mama and Aunt do. Write soon, no Mat∣ter on what Subject. I would hear any thing from you, though ever so trifling. As drowning Men catch at Straws for Relief, so dispirited Folks catch at Tri∣fles for Comfort; not that your Letters can ever be such to me.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I JUST now received yours of the 5th. I am somewhat better, but not en∣tirely recovered.</P>
<P>If you chuse <HI>Milton</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> for the Subject of our ensuing Correspondence, I shall be pleased; but if you like better to write such Thoughts as occur to you on any Author you happen to be reading at the Time of writing, I shall be very well satisfied. It is true there is a noble Fund in <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> but I would not keep you always confined to one
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Kind of Study. The Book of <HI>Job,</HI> the <HI>Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,</HI> the <HI>Wis∣dom of Solomon,</HI> and of <HI>the Son of Sirach,</HI> supply large and rich Funds for Observa∣tions; but take your own way, and please yourself.</P>
<P>I should not have written you till I had read four or five more Books of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> unless you had been impa∣tient; and as the Post is just going out, I shall not add more here, nor even transcribe my Remarks on two Books of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> that are ready; so you will probably get five together.</P>
<P>I may see you about this Day fort∣night, or perhaps sooner. In the mean Time, keep yourself employed. Write
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
about something, no Matter what. The Mind requires Exertion, and it is as liable to be disordered through Inactivity, as the Body.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 10, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is worth Observation, that <HI>Homer</HI> every now and then scatters short moral Reflections as he goes along: for Example, Book x. Verse 29.
<Q>Rare Gift! —but oh! what Gift to Fools avails?</Q>
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
No Wonder indeed he is so pregnant with them, since Virtue is the great End of his Work.</P>
<P>The Interview between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and his Mother, in Hell, Book xi. Verse 190, is exceeding fine.</P>
<P>At Verse 423, we have a new Instance of the Hospitality of the Antients.</P>
<P>Verse 444. In spite of all that is said in Defence of <HI>Homer</HI> here, I cannot help thinking all this Speech very mean, and unworthy of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>The Description of <HI>Hercules,</HI> at Verse 747, is very awful.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/>I am of Opinion, that if you take the whole Account of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s Descent into Hell, and compare it with that of <HI>Aeneas</HI> in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s sixth Aeneid, you will find the former fall infinitely short of the latter; than which nothing, sure, was ever writ∣ten with greater Mastery of Fancy and Judgment. It is worth your while to compare them.</P>
<P>Now we are to leave the <HI>Phoeacians,</HI> and I cannot, for my Heart, think they were so worthless a People, as the Com∣mentators would make them. Are they not kind, hospitable, and beneficent? Do they not understand the Arts of Sail∣ing, Building, Gardening, Commerce, and so forth? All that can be said against them, is, that they lived luxuriously;
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
and is there any Wonder that such a happy People should live so?</P>
<P>The Commentators excuse <HI>Homer</HI> for the strange improbable Stories he makes <HI>Ulysses</HI> tell, because he tells them to an idle, credulous, vain-glorious People. But, in my Opinion, this is no Defence, at all; for as they do not contradict his Narrations, so it is immaterial, as to the Truth of the Stories, who he told them to.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil,</HI> in my Opinion, has not only happily imitated the Story of <HI>Elpenor,</HI> in the twelfth Book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> but has also improved upon it. Herein the Latin seems to have an Advantage over the Greek Poet. <HI>Homer's Elpenor</HI> was a
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
worthless Fellow, yet the Author treats him as a Man of great Importance. <HI>Ulysses</HI> first meets him in Hell, where there is a long Conversation between them, and, un∣deserving as he was, great Care is taken about his Monument; whereas <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Palinurus,</HI> besides being his chief Pilot, was a Man of Integrity and Virtue.</P>
<P>Verse 210. What Reason can be assign∣ed why <HI>Ulysses</HI> did not stop his Ears with Wax as well as the rest? The Song of the Syrens here is admirable, and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has rendered it in Lines exquisitely smooth and melodious.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>268.</HI></BIBL>
<L>———forgetful of the Voice divine,</L>
<L>All dreadful bright, my Limbs in Armour shine.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>Was not this Madness in <HI>Ulysses?</HI> Yet it were Pity, had it not been; since it contains a noble Moral, in shewing us the Folly and Absurdity of disobeying the Commands of Heaven.</P>
<P>The People whom <HI>Homer</HI> devotes to Destruction, Verse 420, you are to ob∣serve, he first prepares for it, by a pro∣fane and illicit Way of performing Sa∣crifice. They are going to perpetrate an impious Deed, and they address themselves to it in a profane Manner. Compare this with the Sacrifices of <HI>Korah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> and with the Of∣ferings of <HI>Nabal</HI> and <HI>Abihu,</HI> who put unhallowed Fire into their Censers. See the Book of <HI>Numbers,</HI> Chap. xvi. &amp;c. The Vengeance which overtook the Com∣panions
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> for destroying, or taking to their own Use, what was consecrated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> seems to be a general Warn∣ing to Mankind, not to convert to pro∣fane Uses what has been once set apart for religious Purposes.</P>
<P>Book xiii. Verse 35. Here is a fine Representation of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and it is much heightened by the Simile. Had you ever been in the Country at the Time of great Labour, you would be much more sen∣sible of the Strength of it; but the Just∣ness speaks for itself.</P>
<P>Verse 270. I cannot but think that the Doubts of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> after he knew the Person who spoke to him was <HI>Pallas,</HI> are unjustifiable and unreasonable.
<Q><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
<BIBL>Ver. <HI>445.</HI></BIBL>
<L>Tho' leagu'd against me hundred He∣roes stand,</L>
<L>Hundreds shall fall, if <HI>Pallas</HI> aid my Hand.</L></Q>
How very like is this Sentiment to what is frequently said in the Holy Scriptures! For Instance, <Q>I will not be afraid for ten Thousands of People, that have set themselves against me round about.</Q> <HI>Psal.</HI> iii. Ver. 6.</P>
<P>At Verse 486, we have one of <HI>Homer</HI>'s short moral Reflections,
<Q><L>Set thy Soul at Rest,</L>
<L>And know, whatever Heav'n ordains, is best.</L></Q></P>
<P>We now come to the fourteenth Book, one of the most beautiful in the whole Work. This was my Favourite when I was a Boy, and has remained so ever
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
since. Nothing can be more simple, na∣tural, and affecting, than this Interview between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Eumoeus.</HI> The whole indeed is such a sweet Scene of the Coun∣try, and contains such a Series of Piety and Goodness, as fills the Mind with inexpressible Delight. What an exqui∣site Picture does the Poet give of <HI>Eumoeus</HI> at the Opening!</P>
<P>Verse 146. How true, even to this Day, is the Observation which <HI>Eumoeus</HI> makes in this Place!</P>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>480.</HI></BIBL>
<L>These, while on sev'ral Tables they dispose,</L>
<L>As Priest himself, the blameless Rustic rose.</L></Q>
<P>It appears that <HI>Homer,</HI> notwithstand∣ing he has a great Respect for the Priest∣hood,
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
thought every Head, or Chief of a Family, was a sort of Priest in his own House, at least in case of Necessity, and this many People contend for, at this Day. Even some very learned and pious Men maintain, that, if a Society of Men were cast on some Place, where they could not have the Ordinances duly administered by a legally-admitted Cler∣gyman, it were then lawful for a Lay∣man to perform the sacred Functions. Something of this Nature is the Permis∣sion which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> gives to Midwives to baptize, in Cases of Ne∣cessity.
<Q><BIBL>Verse <HI>494.</HI></BIBL>
<P>From God's own Hand descend our Joys and Woes.</P></Q>
Here is a Piece of Theology exactly
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
correspondent to what many Christian Divines maintain.</P>
<P>Verse 510. Here follows a strange Con∣trivance to get some Cloaths against the Rigour of the Season, which I cannot think altogether necessary, considering how humane an Host <HI>Eumoeus</HI> is de∣scribed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> seems to differ much in Opi∣nion from <HI>Longinus</HI> about <HI>Homer,</HI> when he wrote the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> I cannot but join with <HI>Longinus,</HI> in thinking <HI>Homer</HI> was on the Decline. Though it is a charm∣ing as well as instructive Composition, yet it seems to me to carry some Marks of old Age. If you have never seen <HI>Lon∣ginus,</HI> I will bring one to Town. You
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
may read it in a short Time. It is a small Treatise, but admirably judicious. Recall what <HI>Pope</HI> says of him in his Essay on Criticism,
<Q><L>Thee, great Longinus, all the Nine inspire,</L>
<L>And fill their Critic with a Poet's Fire;</L>
<L>An ardent Judge, who, zealous in his Trust,</L>
<L>With Warmth gives Sentence, and is always just;</L>
<L>Whose own Example strengthens all his Laws,</L>
<L>And is himself the great Sublime he draws.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Post is just come in, but not a Syllable from you, which makes it less welcome to me. The Duke of <HI>Hamil∣ton</HI> is to come here on <HI>Tuesday,</HI> which will take me off from writing you any more on <HI>Homer,</HI> for some Time; yet
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
let not that hinder your writing, and give me every thing that occurs.</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu, <SALUTE>my dear Life,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>I am yours, J. P.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<SALUTE>Ma très chere petite Ange,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have now finished five Books more of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and my Remarks shall be as short as I can possibly make them.</P>
<P>Book xv. Verse 61. Here we meet another Instance of the great Hospitality of the Antients.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32"/>Verse 75, and some of the ensuing Lines, contain admirable Rules for good Behaviour then, for what it is now, and ever will continue. The last Line I al∣lude to, namely,
<Q>Welcome the coming, speed the parting Guest,</Q>
is liberally just; but then the Manner of putting it in Practice should be as deli∣cate as the Precept itself.</P>
<P>Verse 426. What <HI>Homer</HI> here observes of dedicating a Part of a Winter-Night to Conversation, and particularly to the Re∣collection of past Afflictions, is very na∣tural and just.</P>
<P>Verse 450. <HI>To bend a Bow with tender Skill,</HI> appears to me a very odd Expression.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33"/>Book xvi. Verse 9. What follows here is very natural and beautiful, especially the Dogs playing so familiarly at the Re∣turn of the Prince, whom they knew so well. Observe, their Behaviour was far different when <HI>Ulysses</HI> came.</P>
<P>Verse 144. When <HI>Telemachus</HI> has en∣joined <HI>Eumoeus</HI> to announce his Return to his Mother, how beautifully affecting is the Swain's Reply!
<Q><L>I hear, and I obey,</L>
<L>But old Laertes weeps his Life away,</L>
<L>And deems thee lost; shall I my speed employ</L>
<L>To bless his Age, a Messenger of Joy?</L></Q>
His compassionate Concern for the Grand-father's dejected Situation, joined to the Readiness wherewith he undertakes to carry glad Tidings to <HI>Penelope,</HI> is the
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Result of the most humane and benevo∣lent Mind.
<Q><BIBL>Verse <HI>176.</HI></BIBL>
<L>The Dogs intelligent confess'd the Tread</L>
<L>Of Pow'r divine, and howling, trembling fled.</L></Q>
This Notion prevails among Country Peo∣ple, at least in Scotland, to this Day. They fancy the Dogs are sensible when a good or an evil Spirit comes into a House.</P>
<P>Verse 204. <HI>Ulysses</HI> discovering himself to his Son affords us a very fine and pleasing Scene; yet I think it much in∣ferior to that of <HI>Joseph</HI> making himself known to his Brethren, I confess.
<Q><BIBL>Verse <HI>345.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Argus, the Dog, his antient Master knew.</P></Q>
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
What a Pack of unfeeling Wretches must they be, who cavilled at this In∣cident of the faithful Dog! All that <HI>Pope</HI> says on it does Honour to his own Hu∣manity and Discernment.
<Q><BIBL>Book <HI>xix.</HI> Ver. <HI>536.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Then chaunting mystic Lays.</P></Q>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday I received a Letter from you, of no Date, which I impute to the Hurry you were in when you wrote it. If the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> had not been here, I had seen you before now. He went away on Saturday; I accom∣panied him to <HI>Henley,</HI> about 18 Miles from this City, stayed there all Night, and returned hither on Sunday. My Visit to <HI>Tew,</HI> the Place where his Grace's Aunt resides, was to have been made
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
this Day, but is deferred till my Return from <HI>London</HI>; so I shall see you sooner than I thought, and perhaps may be able to tell you the exact Time, before I seal this Letter.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> has no Occa∣sion for the Degree of Doctor of Laws, but it is an Honour the University pays him. It is customary to confer dif∣ferent Degrees of Honour, to those who study therein. That of <HI>Batchelor of Arts,</HI> may be taken after having resided so long a Time, and undergoing such Examina∣tions as are appointed. In the same Manner, Students may be advanced to the Degree of <HI>Master of Arts.</HI> After∣wards they can be promoted to a <HI>Batche∣lorship</HI> in one of the three great Profes∣sions,
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
Divinity, Law, or Physic; and after that they may be made <HI>Doctors</HI> in those Professions, according to the dif∣ferent Studies they have pursued. But sometimes these Degrees are conferred, without waiting the ordinary Time, or passing the Examinations, <HI>Honoris Gratiâ,</HI> that is to say, to do Honour to the Per∣son who receives them. This was the Case with the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> he hav∣ing been greatly beloved, esteemed, and respected, for his Behaviour, while at this University. I hope I have now sa∣tisfied your Curiosity; but I had almost forgot to tell you that sometimes a Doc∣torship in a fourth Profession is given, namely, in Music; but this is not held, in any wise, equal to the others.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40"/>I have now taken my Place in the Stage-Coach for Friday next, so if it please God, I hope to see you about eight o'Clock at Night, on Saturday, at farthest.</P>

<SALUTE>My dearest Angel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Arrived safe here yesternight, between seven and eight, nothing having hap∣pened worth mentioning, except that I
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
was mortified with a great deal of imper∣tinent Chat in the Coach. We were forced to drive two Miles out of the Way to set down two Boys at their Mo∣ther's Door. One Passenger grumbled much at it. I asked him, whether he would not, in the Parent's Situation, wish for such a Courtesy, at the trifling Inconvenience of a short Delay to the Passengers, and in fine Weather? He received the Reproof in Silence, though he did not seem by his Looks to thank me for it. There are more such unfo∣ciable Persons to be met, who prefer the Indulgence of their own peculiar Hu∣mour, to any essential Gratification or Ser∣vice they can bestow on others. Poor Peo∣ple! they are composed of very indifferent Principles, or have been very ill taught.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42"/>I have found all my Friends here well. No Revolutions or News in our littte Society since I left it.</P>
<P>I shall now finish the <HI>Odyssey</HI>; but as I have several Things to do and settle, and Letters to write, you may perhaps not hear from me again for two or three Days. As soon as I have finished the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> we shall think of something else to furnish out our epistolary Conversation. You know no Post goes from this Place on Saturday, nor arrives here on Mon∣day, so you cannot expect a Letter from from me again till Tuesday at soonest, and it may be later; yet let not that pre∣vent your writing.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43"/>At the Beginning of my Letter, I men∣tioned impertinent Chat. I will give you one Instance. There was one Fel∣low in the Coach, who told us, three Times, a long, dull, and consequently tedious Story, of his having been at the taking of a Highwayman; but that, like a prudent Soldier, he reserved his Fire till he had Occasion for it. When he had told it us once, he took care to re∣peat it as often as any new Passenger came into the Coach, which produced, on the whole, a third Narration. He described the Highwayman's Person and Dress, his Horse, his own Horse, the whole Chace, his personal Intrepidity, the taking, Trial, and Condemnation of the unhappy Rogue, with a Thousand more contingent Circumstances equally
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
important and entertaining. How na∣tural is it to repeat, as well as to aggran∣dize Matters, which we think may re∣dound to our own Credit! The Story still buzzes in my Ears, and haunts me like a Ghost; but if I dwell upon it any longer, I shall become as troublesome as the Relater, so I break off.</P>

the second was sent <HI>tout droit,</HI> which is the Reason why they were both delivered at once. The Story of the poor young Lady makes me melancholy.</P>

<P>ONCE more for the Odyssey. I have got through three Books more, on which I have made but few Obser∣vations.</P>
<P>Book xx. Verse 55. The Complaint of <HI>Minerva,</HI> in this Place, is analogous to that which we find so often made by our Saviour in the Gospel, <HI>O ye of little Faith,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Verse 120. <HI>Ulysses</HI> desiring a Sign to confirm his Faith, in this and the two
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
following Books, is exactly conformable to many Places in Scripture. The Story of <HI>Ahaz,</HI> as well as of others, will suf∣ficiently prove it.</P>
<P>Book xxi. Verse 10. Is it not too much affected to call <HI>Ivory, Elephant?</HI> It is done, however, in other Places as well as in this.</P>
<P>Verse 274. The Suitors impute their Impotence in bending the Bow of <HI>Ulys∣ses,</HI> to their Profanation of a holy Day. Whether it was a fictitious or a real Ex∣cuse, it shews at least that Irreligion was held a very atrocious Crime in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>Verse 427. <HI>Ulysses</HI> turning and examin∣ing the Bow, to prove if it was decayed
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
or worm-eaten, amid the Taunts of the Suitors, and his bending it, compared to a Musician winding up the Strings of his Instrument, is most admirably fine. The Notes here are well worth reading.</P>
<P>Verse 448. This is an exquisite Com∣parison. The Twang of the String, short and sharp, like the shrill Note of a Swal∣low, was equally a Mark of Vigour and Address.</P>
<P>Book xxii. Verse 367. All that follows here, relative to <HI>Phemius</HI> and <HI>Medon,</HI> their Supplication, the Interposition of <HI>Tele∣machus,</HI> and the Motives which induced Ulysses to spare them, excite both our Pity and Admiration. The Idea which <HI>Phemius</HI> gives of Poets and Poetry, is
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
one of the finest that can be conceived, and worthy to be imprinted on every Memory.</P>
<Q><L>For dear to Gods and Men is sacred Song.</L>
<L>Self-taught, I sing; by Heav'n, and Heav'n alone,</L>
<L>The genuine Seeds of Poesy are sown;</L>
<L>And (what the Gods bestow) the lofty Lay</L>
<L>To Gods alone, and God-like Worth we pay.</L>
<L>— — — nor sordid Pay,</L>
<L>Nor servile Flatt'ry stain'd the moral Lay.</L></Q>
<P>Verse 425. Here is a most just and beautiful Comparison. The Situation of the Fishes, so poetically rendered by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> must touch every compassionate Mind;
<Q><L>All naked of their Element, and bare,</L>
<L>The Fishes pant, and gasp in thinner Air.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51"/>I must return to Verse 137, of this Book. Read the Note upon it, and tell me if you don't think the Caution of placing the Bow out of the Reach of the Suitors was needless, when none of them could bend it.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall in this close what I have to say on the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P>Book xxiii. Verse 13. Here are four Lines which are very consonant to what
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
we frequently meet in the holy Writings, particularly in the 19th Chapter <HI>Isaiah;</HI> "Surely the Princes of <HI>Zoan</HI> are Fools, &amp;c."</P>
<P>Verse 81, and some following Lines, contain Sentiments very analogous to many in the Book of <HI>Job.</HI> It is worth your while to compare them with the following Chapters, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, which indeed are worth the most atten∣tive Perusal and Remarks.</P>
<P>Verse 320. This Conversation between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Penelope,</HI> how naturally beau∣tiful! In all Degrees of Life we may hourly trace the same Consequences of a long Absence, whether between Man and Wife, or Friend and Friend. The
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
Episode of <HI>Mercury</HI> conducting the Souls of the Suitors to Hell, at the Opening of the 24th Book, is undoubtedly fine; though after all that can be said in De∣fence of it, to me it appears brought in (to use a common Phrase) by Head and Shoulders. It seems as if the Poet had the Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> so much at Heart, that he thought it not sufficient∣ly compleated, without this finishing Stroke.</P>
<P>Verse 224. <HI>Homer,</HI> you observe, takes every Opportunity to pay Honour to Poets and Poetry. These two Lines,
<Q><L>The Gods, to honour her fair Fame, shall raise</L>
<L>(Their great Reward) a Poet in her Praise,</L></Q>
and the six preceding, are so strong, and at the same Time so charming an Incen∣tive
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
to Virtue, that I cannot but think a Woman, who has a laudable Ambi∣tion and Love of Virtue, must be greatly confirmed by them, in a virtuous and honourable Course of Life.</P>
<P>Verse 249. I cannot endure <HI>Pope</HI>'s bald Expression of <HI>the old Man,</HI> for so he makes Ulyssses stile his Father. In <HI>Homer</HI> it is <HI>the Father,</HI> which has undeniably much more Decorum, Respect, and Af∣fection.</P>
<P>I have nothing further to add to what has been said in the Notes on the Close of this great Work. I shall endeavour to get you <HI>Kennel</HI>'s Translation of <HI>Ho∣race</HI>'s Judgment on the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iad</HI> and Odyssey. All other Translations of that Passage are bad. His only is tolerable.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55"/>I scarce need remark to you that <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> copied much from <HI>Homer,</HI> particu∣larly in the sixth and last Book; but methinks it would be entertaining to compare the Passages of two such great Poets, and two such fine Translators as <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Dryden.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Swift</HI> did not think so ill of Women as he wrote. His Motives were to wean them from such Faults, as he thought them most subject to.

<P>JUST now I have the Pleasure of of yours. You thank me for what does not deserve Thanks. The Picture was drawn to my Hand, and I thought

it a Picture worth your looking at; though I assure you, I had not the least Idea that it resembled you.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JUST now I received yours. Your Observations are very just. The whole Song consists of a Heap of fine
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
smooth Words, put together either with∣out any Meaning at all, or ending in downright Nonsense, after the Manner of many of our modern Love-Songs. I would have you observe too that there are no less than two Similes in so short a Poem, which is very ordi∣nary in our Love-Songs, though very unnatural; and, besides that they have no Relation to the Subject, they are very absurd in themselves.</P>
<P>The other Ballad is a very severe Sa∣tire on the Gentlemen of the Army. The Beauty of it consists in its appear∣ing so very serious, and being so exceed∣ingly ridiculous. I beg you will par∣ticularly observe the two last Stanzas, save one. Here the personated Officer
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
accuses himself both with Cowardice and Ignorance of Letters. Mark how ri∣diculous a Fall he makes in Stanza the third.
<Q>Alas! I never thought a Priest would please your Palate;</Q>
This seems to be grave and serious; ob∣serve what follows;
<Q>Besides, I'll hold a Groat, he'll put you in a Ballad.</Q>
How serious does he appear, when he says,
<Q>It fills my Heart with Woe, &amp;c.</Q>
and afterwards calls a Churchman being by the Ladies preferred to an Officer, "the Growth of Corruption, <HI>&amp;c."</HI> It
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
is, all through, a most admirable Satire, and the Humour is exceedingly well hit off. Then it is calculated for the Tune of <HI>Patie</HI>'s <HI>Mill.</HI> If you heard it sung to that Tune, you would find it set off mightily; it being a sweet com∣plaining Scotch Tune, the Captain's Complaint, if we may so call it, would thereby become still more ridiculous.</P>
<P><HI>Charles Murray</HI> does not succeed to the Title, but a Son of <HI>David Murray,</HI> who was an elder Brother than <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>A Campaign is the Warfare of one Season; and to open the Campaign, im∣plies no more than to begin the military Operations of such or such a Year.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64"/>When I send you a Production writ∣ten with Spirit, Wit, and Judgment, either for or against your Sex, you are to understand the Contents as so many Hints to you, what you are to shun, and what you are to pursue.

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Suppose you have, before this comes to your Hand, formed a Judgment of the three Ladies I sent to wait upon you; I mean <HI>Sylvia, Artimesia,</HI> and <HI>Phryne.</HI> You may learn something from the Con∣versation of the two first; but as for Ma∣dam <HI>Phryne,</HI> I cannot say you can im∣prove by her; and indeed, but that she has a little Wit in her Conversation, I
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
had not sent her to you at all. <HI>Sylvia</HI> is a poor Lady, who struggles between Virtue and Vice, and is really not so bad as she would appear. She has taken up a false Notion of the Means of recom∣mending herself to the Esteem of Man∣kind. She thinks ill-natured Wit, Cen∣sure, and Raking, are the Ingredients for the Composition of a fine Lady, yet her Heart recoils every now and then. How many poor Women have lost them∣selves through this foolish Notion! There is nothing more dangerous for any Per∣son, especially a Woman, than to set up some wrong Quality as the distinguish∣ing Mark of her Character. A Coward perhaps sets up for a Bully, a chearful Woman for a Prude, or a modest, good-natured Girl takes it into her Head to
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
be a Termagant. Now besides being unnatural from quitting their proper Characters, they are all alike full of Af∣fectation, than which nothing is more detestable, except downright Inconti∣nence. <HI>Artimesia</HI> is a Prude, but a mas∣culine Prude; she affects Learning, but neglects Decency, Cleanliness, and Mo∣desty. If I were with you, I think I could name three Persons, with whom the Characters agree very well, though I could not tell you the exact Persons the Poet meant.</P>
<P>I have herewith sent you a fourth Character, which is not so bad as the former; for I think it very natural, as well as excusable, for People, especially Women, to talk of their Children, Family
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
Affairs, and so forth; and still more so in Country Places, where they meet their Neighbours only now and then. Hence I think the Doctor rather too severe, un∣less he barely meant that Women should not carry this sort of Discourse to Ex∣cess.</P>
<P>I have now sent you five or six bad Characters of your Sex, to which you may add whatever you may have read beside. <HI>Congreve</HI> furnishes many; name∣ly, Mrs. <HI>Fondlewife</HI><NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Laetitia</HI> in the <HI>Old Batchelor.</HI></NOTE>, Mrs. <HI>Frail</HI><NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Love for Love.</NOTE>, Mrs. <HI>Foresight</HI><NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Love for Love.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Froth</HI><NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Double Dealer.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Pliant</HI><NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">Double Dealer.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Touchwood</HI><NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">Double Dealer.</NOTE>, Lady <HI>Wishfort</HI><NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot">Way of the World.</NOTE>, Mrs. <HI>Marwood</HI><NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot">Way of the World.</NOTE>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and even his virtuous Characters are worth observing for their Failings; for Example, the Affectation of <HI>Belin∣da</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Old Batchelor.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Millamant</HI><NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Way of the World.</HI></NOTE>, and the Wild∣ness of <HI>Angelica</HI><NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Love for Love.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some Critics have asserted that <HI>Con∣greve</HI> has drawn none but vicious Cha∣racters, but I think they are mistaken. <HI>Cynthia</HI> <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Double Dealer.</HI></NOTE> is an Exception. He has many other beautiful Characters, not faultless indeed. That Writer was too great a Master of Nature, to draw
<Q>Faultless Monsters that the World ne'er saw,</Q>
as the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> calls them. We must not forget <HI>Ben Johnson's</HI> Lady
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
<HI>Wou'd-be</HI><NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Volpone.</HI></NOTE>, and <HI>Otway</HI>'s <HI>Lady Dunce</HI><NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Soldier for the Ladies.</HI></NOTE>. These bad Characters (which weak un∣discerning People have condemned as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mproper for Representation, and thence have endeavoured to decry the Utility of the Drama in general) have all their good Tendencies. There is something to be culled out of every one worth ob∣serving and shunning; and those who say that faulty Characters should not be produced on the Stage, might with an equal Degree of Propriety assert, that there should be no Shade in a Picture.</P>
<P>In my next I will send you some pleas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Characters from the same Author; but in the mean Time (by the way of Music between the Acts) I give you some
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
Extracts from Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Poem on his own Death. You will find in it a great deal of Wit, Humour, good Sense, and true Judgment of Mankind, and the Faults of both Sexes most humourously exposed and ridiculed.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may have read this Poem already, notwithstanding, attend to it once more. Much Good may be derived from it Vice and Folly appear in so many Shapes, that it is worth our while to study as many and as various Cha∣racters of faulty Men and Women, as we can find, in order to warn us against them, in whatsoever Shape they may appear, or attack us. I shall refer a Translation of a Passage of this Tenden∣cy from the noble Historian, <HI>Livy,</HI> to

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I JUST now received yours of yester∣day. I am perfectly of your Opinion about the Verses on the <HI>Dean's Death</HI>; and especially of those four Lines, which are so lively a Representation of what usually happens on such Occasions.</P>
<P>I have one Word more to say about <HI>Artimesia.</HI> It is not a vicious Character, only it includes a Want of Decency, and a total Neglect of all the Duties of Life, for the Affectation of Learning. If I remember right, <HI>Pope</HI> imputes much the same Charge to Mrs. <HI>Haywood</HI> and
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
<HI>Centlivre.</HI> I have said thus much, for the Sake of quoting you four Lines from the admirable <HI>Boileau,</HI> which I think much <HI>a-propos.</HI></P>

<P>I have not much more Time for writ∣ing at present, but on Sunday I will send you many Things to make Amends for what I now defer. I shall not send you the pleasing Characters I mentioned till then; but to recompense your Pa∣tience, I enclose the <HI>Progress of Love,</HI> with which I believe you will be much pleas∣ed. I likewise convey you some Lines

of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> on the Birth-Day of Mrs. <HI>Blunt,</HI> a Lady whom he admires. There you will see another faulty Character drawn in the Lines I have marked; <HI>Phyllis</HI> is another of the same Species; yet these, and those I sent you formerly, are all different from each other.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 12, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here enclose you two Poems; in one of them the estimable and unbecom∣ing Qualifications of your Sex are set in Opposition to each other, by Way of Contrast. How lasting are those of the first Sort, how fleeting those of the lat∣ter! Beauty and all external Advantages are ingeniously compared to Fruit in∣grafted on the Stock of an annual Plant, which indeed makes a luxuriant Shoot, but is soon gone. I presume you know that an annual Plant continues only one Year, such as Fruits, Vegetables, and
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
Corn of all Kinds. Those which last many Years, as large Trees, we call Perennials.</P>
<P>In the other Poem the <HI>Dean</HI> pursues <HI>Epictetus</HI>'s Notion of Things in our own Power, such as Virtue and Truth. He makes small Account of Beauty, Shape, Complexion, and such Qualities as we cannot procure to ourselves; but Honour, Chastity, Decency, Integrity, and all within our own Power to attain, he places in a most estimable Light.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid,</HI> in his <HI>Art of Love,</HI> which I be∣lieve you have by you, or at least have read, finely pursues the same Train of Ideas, both in his two first Books, which he wrote to instruct the Men, and in his
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
third, which he calculated to regulate the Conduct of Women.</P>
<P>There is something exceeding singular in the Humour of both Poems. In <HI>Stella</HI>'s <HI>Birth-Day</HI> he continues the Strain he be∣gan with, in talking of her. He then puts these in Opposition, and, as it were, Foils to her, as if they were really <HI>Signs.</HI> Witness those four most humorous Lines,
<Q><L>Then who can think we'll quit the Place,</L>
<L>When Doll hangs out a newer Face,</L>
<L>Or stop and 'light at Chloe's Head,</L>
<L>With Scraps and Leavings to be fed?</L></Q></P>
<P>I have many more entertaining Pieces for you of the <HI>Dean</HI>'s, such as <HI>Mary the Cookmaid</HI>'s <HI>Letter to Dr. Sheridan,</HI> and two Bal∣lads;
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
the one stiled <HI>Quadrille,</HI> the other <HI>Molly Mog,</HI> which I will send you at some future Time, if you tell me in your next Letter that you have not seen them. I do not think it a Trouble to transcribe a Piece of any Length, provided I am assured you reap either Instruction or Delight from it; but both these united ought to be the Result of Reading. If <HI>you</HI> do not acquire this Advantage, the Fault, I should conceive, must be in my wrong Choice of Materials. You are docile and quick; and with a Person of your Talents, Hints and transient Obser∣vations, delivered in this light easy Mode of a Letter, will go further than all the set formal Rules for teaching, that ever were laid down.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80"/>Till I send you the above, you shall have <HI>Prometheus,</HI> written against <HI>Wood</HI> and his Halfpence. It is very full of Wit. I give it you therefore now by way of Relief, and at some future Time you shall have his favourable Characters of Women.</P>
<P>I think it necessary to premise some Account of the above-mentioned Poem, which possibly you are a Stranger to.</P>
<P>A Man, whose Name was <HI>Wood,</HI> ob∣tained a Patent from King George I. to make Halfpenny Pieces of base Metal, which were to be current in <HI>Ireland.</HI> This Project would have drained that poor Kingdom of all the good Money; but the <HI>Dean,</HI> under the Name of <HI>M. B.
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
Drapier,</HI> wrote such smart Letters and Poems, sometimes serious and sometimes ludicrous, as to raise a Resentment against <HI>Wood,</HI> that abolished his Scheme. The Nation would not receive any of his Coin, and the Coiner was in Danger of being torn in Pieces. From that Time, the <HI>Dean</HI> was looked on as the Deliverer of his Country.</P>
<P>You talk of going to <HI>Richmond</HI> for a few Days. You must stay a Week abroad at least, otherwise it is not worth your while to go. During your Excursion, you should go by Water to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> see that Palace, the famous <HI>Cartoons</HI> of <HI>Ra∣phael,</HI> and the Beauties of King <HI>William</HI>'s Court. Then I would recommend to you to walk through the Park, to view the
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
Cascades, from thence to <HI>Ham-House,</HI> and so return to <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>I give you this Advice, because I wish that every thing you undertake, even a Scheme of Dissipation, should answer some useful End. A Survey of fine Paint∣ing feeds the Mind, by enlarging the Fancy; the Walks and Cascades shew what human Art is capable of; and even a Meadow or common Field are Sources of Learning, Piety, and Admira∣tion, in an attentive and well-directed Mind.</P>

<P>I Have your Letter of the 14th, but where has it been? It was not put into the Post till yesternight, for the Post-Mark bears the 16th Day of the Month, the Letter itself is dated the 7th, and I have only received it this Day. Here is an Interval of nine Days. However, now that it is come at last, I am very well pleased with it. It is written very clean and genteel. It has the Appearance of coming from a <HI>Gentle∣woman.</HI> People are not in general suf∣ficiently aware how much they expose

<P>Your Thoughts and Reflections are entirely just, and prettily expressed, en∣tirely of a Piece with the Neatness of the writing, so that (if I may use the Expres∣sion) I love both the Soul and Body of your Letter.</P>
<P>I here send you <HI>Prometheus,</HI> and Part of a Song, wherein there is a pretty Con∣trast of three young Ladies. In my next Letter I propose sending you three Poems, all written in Favour of the Ladies, to
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
make Amends for the disagreeable Pic∣tures I shewed you before. After these you shall have <HI>Mary the Cook-Maid,</HI> and <HI>Quadrille,</HI> with some Things out of <HI>Ho∣race</HI>; which, although the Translation is not dressed in the best Poetry in the World, will, in Respect to the Sentiment, I dare say, give you much Delight.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Never heard of that Song of <HI>Stella</HI> and <HI>Flavia,</HI> which you say is now so much in Vogue. I wish you would get me a Copy of it. I have at last sent the beau∣tiful Characters I promised, and hope you will like them. I leave you to find out the Beauties in the <HI>Extract,</HI> and <HI>the Lady at Court</HI>; but I must have a Word or two about <HI>Biddy Floyd,</HI> which I dare say you have seen long before now.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87"/>The Humour, it is true, is whimsi∣cal, but exceeding just. You see it is given by way of Receipt, and carried on pretty much in the Stile of common Receipts for making Jellies or Conserves. In the first Place, he gives you the essen∣tial Qualities, and then points out the Faults which are apt to grow up with them, and from which those Qualities ought to be separated. For Example, he says, that
<Q>Candour, Innocence, and Good-nature,</Q>
should be picked clean from
<Q>Demureness, Aukwardness, and Coyness;</Q> the Seasoning or Pickle to those fine Qua∣lities consists of
<Q>Good Breeding, Wit, Air, and decent Pride,</Q>
cleansed from
<Q>Coquetry, Affectation, Pertness, and Vanity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88"/>This you must allow to be very apt and judicious, perfectly in the Stile of common Receipts. For Instance now,</P>
<P>To preserve Apples, you must sepa∣rate the Fruit from
<Q>The Peel, the Stalk, the Core, and Seeds,</Q>
you must then make use of
<Q>The finest Sugar free from all Dross;</Q>
and during the Process, to clear off the Scum as it rises, and so forth.</P>
<P>This is all as instructive as entertain∣ing; and I do think, my dear Nancy, that every young Woman should always carry this <HI>Receipt to make a Beauty</HI> about with her. The Female that is <HI>seasoned,</HI> and <HI>preserved</HI> in this Manner, take my Word for it, will be a <HI>Beauty</HI> in the Eyes
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
of all sensible Men and Women, though <HI>Jove,</HI> in mixing up the Composition, has not, perhaps, employed his finest Clay.</P>
<P>In my next I will send you the <HI>Quid∣nuncs</HI>; it is, in my Opinion, a fine Tale, full of Humour, and carries with it a very useful Moral.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVE you an Inclination for <HI>Molly Mog,</HI> or the <HI>Letter to Mr. John Moore</HI> about Worms? They are both di∣verting.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90"/>You have now read the <HI>Journal of a modern fine Lady.</HI> It sets forth the foolish unprofitable Manner in which many La∣dies pass, or rather waste their Time, in so lively a Strain, that I think you should read it often, and that with great Atten∣tion. Not that I mean to imply any immediate Necessity you have for it; but though you do not stand in need of it by way of Remedy, it might serve to carry about as an Amulet or Charm; a kind of Preservative against the Evils it is calculated to cure.</P>
<P><HI>Livy,</HI> the great <HI>Roman Historian,</HI> says, the Use of History is to teach us what we are to shun, and what we are to imi∣taee. This ought to be the great End of Poetry as well as History. And <HI>Horace,</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
who was one of the most judicious Poets that ever lived in any Age or Country, tells us, this Instruction is to be attained from a Mixture of the <HI>utile</HI> with the <HI>dulce,</HI> that is, of the <HI>useful</HI> with the <HI>pleasant.</HI> Now in all the little Poems I have sent you, I think there is this Mixture; and they likewise answer the End prescribed by <HI>Livy,</HI> they <Q>teach what we are to shun, and what to imitate.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI>'s golden Rule of <HI>utile dulci,</HI> was never more properly applied than when it was made the Motto of a Thea∣tre; since the Stage, under suitable Re∣gulations, is most capable of answering the Intent. The greatest moral Writers can only prescribe Rules for a Rectitude of Conduct and Decorum of Behaviour;
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
the Stage shews you the Beauty and Force of those Rules, when put into Practice. It moreover answers the great Purpose and Use which <HI>Livy</HI> ascribes to History. It shews <Q>what to shun, and what to imitate,</Q> more immediately and ac∣curately than any Historian whatsoever is capable of doing.</P>
<P>I enclose the <HI>Quidnuncs.</HI> I think there is not any thing necessary to subjoin, by way of Note, except to tell you that the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was Regent of <HI>France</HI> in this King's Minority. He was a very great Man, and died when I was in <HI>France,</HI> in the Year 1722.</P>
<P>I should be glad to know exactly when you set out for <HI>Richmond,</HI> because I
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
think I can provide you a very agreeable Companion in the literary Way. It is a Poem called <HI>The Alley.</HI> It describes all inconvenient and disagreeable Circum∣stances, which are met in the pleasant-situated Town and Villages on the Banks of the <HI>Thames.</HI> It would be an Enter∣tainment to you any where, and at any Time; but you will be much more sen∣sible of the Beauties, when you are passing through those Places. I therefore shall not send it, till you tell me that you are about to set forward.</P>
<P>You shall have two or three little di∣verting Poems to-morrow.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you herewith a small Collection of <HI>Epigrammatical</HI> Poems; the Beauty of this Kind of writing consists in a cer∣tain Point, or Turn of Wit. They are rather for your Diversion, than any thing else. This perhaps you may reproach me for, as deviating from the great <HI>utile dulci,</HI> which I so strongly recom∣mended in my last Letter. But, pro∣vided this Rule is generally practised, there is no Harm in a short casual Devia∣tion; as there is not any thing amiss in rising to a Game of Battledore and Shut∣tlecock,
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
after a long sedentary Applica∣tion to Reading or Writing; nay it is ra∣ther right than wrong, in-as-much as it tends to render both Mind and Body, like <HI>Aesop</HI>'s relaxed Bow, <Q>fitter for Use when you want them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>The Happiness of a Parson's Life,</HI> is surely exceeding humorous. It very na∣turally describes those simple and hum∣ble Pleasures, whereof a Country Cler∣gyman's Life consists. Yet these per∣haps afford a more lasting Satisfaction, (though not so exquisite an Enjoyment) than those which are more refined, and what the <HI>French</HI> call more <HI>spirituelles</HI>; at least, they are very innocent Plea∣sures.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96"/>One of the next two Poems I shall send you, is called <HI>the Elephant,</HI> or <HI>Par∣liament-Man,</HI> and the other <HI>Aye and No.</HI> They both satirize, with great Wit and Humour, the Corruption of <HI>Members,</HI> which so shamefully prevails at present. The Parliament, I presume you know, is an Assemblage of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons of a Kingdom, for national Purposes. It de∣rives its Name from the French Verb <HI>parler, to speak.</HI> We have our English Word <HI>Parley,</HI> from the same Root. Per∣haps you could have told me this, and perhaps not, and your Ignorance never∣theless not to be taxed with Blame. It is amazing how much Knowledge is lost for Want of a little common Attention or Observation in our general Intercourse

with the World. Numberless are the Instances I have seen of sensible clever People being put to the Blush, and to a Difficulty, by a simple Question pro∣posed from a Person of inferior Talents, and be infinitely astonished at themselves, that they should have been so long igno∣rant of so plain a Matter.</P>
<P>If I have a Letter from you by this Day's Post, which I look for, I will add a Postscript. Pray see that the enclosed be immediately put into the Penny-Post.</P>

<P>YOUR Letter just now came to my Hand. I find that, which I wrote you this Day Se'nnight, is miscarried. I enclosed <HI>the Cook-Maid's Letter</HI> in it, and, If I am not mistaken, sent it un∣der Mr. K —'s Cover. Perhaps he con∣signed it to the Penny-Post, and it has been mislaid or neglected there.

I mentioned therein that I would send you a Letter of Introduc∣tion
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
to a Family at <HI>Richmond</HI>; and your not noticing this Particular, convinces me that same must be what we have lost.</P>
<P>Now to your Questions—</P>
<P>A <HI>Rap</HI> is a Blow, and likewise a base Coin used in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Whigs</HI> are for destroying the <HI>Church,</HI> or at least, for reducing it. The Tories are for exalting it. <HI>Down with the Church,</HI> and <HI>Up with the Church,</HI> were frequent Expressions with the respective Parties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mill-Dam</HI> is the Place where they keep a Reservoir of Water, to set
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
the Mill going. Observe though this is only for Water-Mills, and the Sound, you know, pretty near that of a vulgar Oath.</P>
<P><HI>Pinking</HI> is making small Holes. This was more in Use, at the Time of the old English Habit, when the Doublets for Men were laced, as Stays are for Women. Captain <HI>Bluff,</HI> in <HI>Congreve,</HI> you know, says, <HI>I'll pink his Soul,</HI> in Allusion to this Fashion.</P>
<P>The Ana-Baptists are not baptized till they come to Years of Discretion, and then they are plunged, not sprinkled. The first Part of the Word is adopted from the Greek, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifies against, or contrary. Thus they are
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
<HI>against</HI> baptizing, till such an Advance of Life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mortuary-Guinea</HI> is the Parson's Due at Burials, for reading the Service, Church-yard Fees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is derived from the Latin Word <HI>Mors,</HI> which means <HI>Death</HI>; thence too we have <HI>mortal.</HI></P>
<P>You shall have all the Poems you write of. In the mean Time, I send <HI>The Ele∣phant,</HI> and <HI>Aye and No</HI>; which I believe will please you much.</P>

<P>I Write to you so often, and you write to me so seldom, that I am afraid you begin to be tired with the Corre∣spondence, but hope my Fears are groundless. I assure you it is not every one I would take so much Pains for. I thought that the Want of Amusements in <HI>London,</HI> at this Season of the Year, would have rendered my frequent Writ∣ing a sort of Diversion to you, and, in some Measure, an Amends for the Loss of others. In order to make this Diver∣sion as agreeable and instructive as I am

able, I have transcribed several Poems, such as I thought would best contribute to both these Purposes.</P>
<P>You have Talents so capable of Cul∣tivation, that to be weary of receiving In∣struction, would argue an Ingratitude to Nature, and I cannot think you liable to it. Perhaps I write too often, per∣haps I burthen you with a Frequency of Subjects; or perhaps a little Lassitude and Inattention comes over you now and then, which, at your Time of Life, are excusable, if not indulged too far. If that be the Case, confess. Such Omis∣sions call, at worst, for the mildest Re∣proof; but, I cannot help saying, they would become many young Folks better than you.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104"/>Convinced that you cannot be pur∣posely negligent, I shall proceed in the old Way. I herewith send <HI>Mary the Cook-Maid's Letter to Dr. Sheridan,</HI> and <HI>The Grove,</HI> translated from <HI>Pastor Fido,</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Roscommon.</HI> This is one of the best Pictures of a happy Life that I have ever seen; true Content and true Love, virtuous and innocent, are here delineated in their native beautiful Co∣lours. I shall send you two or three more Poems which I think equal to the former, when I next write, and then rest awhile, or turn to some other Subject. I will not hurry you at all. I request that you will write only when you have Leisure, and be at Pains to do it in a right Manner. You have gain∣ed great Esteem by so doing, for some
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
Time past; do not now begin to for∣feit it.</P>
<P>If there be any Passages or Expressions in what I send, which require an Eclair∣cissement, let me know so much, and I will explain them to you, as fully as I am able. All I do is meant to contri∣bute to your Delight. Nothing can give me more. Pleasure, than to hear that you are happy. Virtue and Piety are the cer∣tain Road to Happiness. Let me hear you are virtuous, and I am sure you are happy.</P>

<P>Now to your Questions—</P>
<P>A <HI>Congress</HI> is a Meeting of Ambassa∣dors to settle Variances between different States and Kingdoms. <HI>Cambray</HI> is a Town in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where such a Con∣gress was held.

<P><PB N="107" REF="108"/>I think <HI>Stella</HI> and <HI>Flavia</HI> very pretty, but it does not, to me, carry the Air of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Writing.

In order to relish any Piece well, it is necessary to consider thoroughly what

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YEsterday I received your agreeable Letter; but you put no Year of our Lord. I don't like this careless Way, because it is the Means of con∣tracting an ill Habit. Besides, you be∣gin a new Sentence with a small Letter, and place no Point between that and your last, which ought never to be done; for though the smaller Points, such as Commas, and Semicolons, may be omit∣ted, full Points never should.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112"/>When you go to <HI>Richmond,</HI> you will be hurried about in seeing various Places. This was the Reason for my mention∣ing an Interval, and I meant no more by it; but as Franks begin to be scarce, I shall be pleased if you write me once a Week, and tell me every Occurrence worth Observation in your Journeys, and how you are received. Perhaps they may be worthy to be called <HI>The Lady's Travels</HI> (not to <HI>Spain,</HI> but) to <HI>Richmond.</HI> You have not yet said when you are to set out, nor how you are to get my Letters, or transmit yours to me. The Penny-Post does not reach <HI>Richmond,</HI> but there is an Office at <HI>Marsh-Gate,</HI> very near the Town. Your best Way to write to me is, in my Opinion, to keep your old Direction, and add, <HI>by
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
London.</HI> I suppose you will take out your few Franks with you.</P>
<P>I send you with this <HI>The Journal of a modern Lady.</HI> In my next, you shall have the <HI>new Simile of a Woman to a Cloud,</HI> and in the next after that, <HI>the Cloud's Answer</HI>; though there are some Indeli∣cacies I much disapprove. However, you are now very capable of discerning, adopting, and rejecting, as best beseems. I have taken up <HI>The Furniture of a La∣dy's Dressing-Room,</HI> I believe, ten Times, in order to transcribe it for you, and have flung it aside as often; I find, on Examination, it does not please me.</P>
<P>When you come from your Excursion, I will execute a Promise I made some
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
Time since; namely, to send you <HI>Horace</HI>'s Judgment of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey.</HI> How much I regret that so exquisite an Author, as <HI>Horace</HI> was, should not hitherto have been translated with that Spirit and Ener∣gy he deserves! He had a most elegant Pen; yet he too had, now and then, his Grossnesses; but they, like <HI>Shakespeare</HI>'s Puns, were rather the Fault of the Age he lived in, than Deficiency in his own Taste. I will however get you the best Translation I can of the above-named Piece, and some others.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have just now received your Letter, and am very sorry for your ill For∣tune; but as this Day and yesterday have been pretty seasonable, and as the Wea∣ther seems to be settled, I hope it will now make you some little Amends. If
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
not, you must endure with Patience, or return home ungratified.</P>
<P>You will possibly think me a very cold dull Philosopher, to preach up Patience and Forbearance to a Person at your Time of Life. I confess they are hard Les∣sons to learn at any Time, but especially so while the Heart is gay, the Passions warm, and Wishes impetuous. Permit me, however, to make one short Obser∣vation, which may, in some Measure, qualify those impatient irksome Sensa∣tions that arise from Disappointments.</P>
<P>The great Reason why Disappoint∣ments sit more uneasy on young Folks, than on Persons advanced in Life, is, that the former assure themselves of a
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
proposed Enjoyment, beyond the Power of Chance to prevent it. They no more advert to the Possibility of a cross Acci∣dent, than if there were no such Thing in Nature. Now methinks it is easy to remember that there is such a Thing as a Disappointment, as well as a Delight. If you, my dear Nancy, when you pro∣ject a Scheme of Pleasure for yourself, or have one proposed to you, would but make it a Rule to say, <HI>I ought not to set my Heart on this,</HI> it would awaken you to all the Chances against you, and so qualify your Mind as to endure the Dis∣appointment without repining, and even enhance the Enjoyment, if your Wishes are gratified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I sincerely wish this Advice may have the same good Effect on some of my young Readers, as it had on Miss <HI>Blisset.</HI> She adopted it the Mo∣ment it was given to her, as the Basis of her fu∣ture Happiness. It is her never-failing Custom to meet all Disappointments, whether in a trivial or a material Concern, with the most perfect Com∣posure of Mind. She may indeed, with great Pro∣priety, be said to be before-hand with ill Chances; since, on a Scheme of Pleasure being proposed, she immediately adverts to the Prevention, instead of the Acquisition; neither does this give any Flat∣ness to her Enjoyments, for I have heard her say it either increases her Relish or their Value; her Pleasures not being worn out in Anticipation, they come to her with all the Gloss of Surprize and Novelty. She attributes the whole Exertion of this philosophical Virtue, and the Advantages she has reaped from it, to the kind and excellent In∣struction given by her Tutor in this Letter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118"/>I wonder you neglected to take a Book with you. Never travel without one; if you do, you go without your best Com∣panion, in Case of foul Weather or Dis∣appointments.</P>
<P>If the Weather should continue fa∣vourable, which I hope it may, do not,
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
by any Means, omit the Sight of <HI>Hamp∣ton Court, Ham Walks,</HI> and <HI>Kew Gardens.</HI></P>
<P>You neither tell me when you went out, nor whether you received the Let∣ters I sent you, after the Date of your last, with the Extracts from <HI>Cadenus</HI> and <HI>Vanessa,</HI> and <HI>The Journal of the modern Lady</HI>; but I can excuse that, considering your Uneasiness.

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 15th just now. I am glad your Mama has conde∣scended to stay another Week, for, not∣withstanding my philosophic Admoni∣tion, it would grieve me that you should be disappointed of your proposed Plea∣sure. I hope you will let me know how you like the Places you see about <HI>Rich∣mond.</HI> The Country all around is charm∣ing. Be sure not to omit the <HI>Green,</HI> nor indeed any Place. Every Object is Food to a contemplative Mind; and without Observation our Travels are nothing

worth. You may smile perhaps at my Application of the Word <HI>Travel,</HI> to your little Excursion, and think it rather ludi∣crous; but I do not mean it so. At your early Time of Life, and considering the little you have seen of the World, the Phrase is not so improper as, at first, it may appear.</P>
<P>You seem not to relish your Reception at Mr. O—y's; you think it was cold, but it consisted only in <HI>Manner.</HI> A second or third Visit will convince you of this. They are very friendly, sincere People, but have no Ostentation. Such Persons generally improve upon our Acquaintance, whereas those who are full of Professions and external Ceremonies, like great Pro∣misers, too often defraud our Expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122"/>In your Progress to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> I beg you will observe the Village of <HI>Teddington.</HI> It is a Place which I love much.</P>
<P>As soon as I send the Answer to the <HI>Simile</HI> here enclosed, I shall give you my Thoughts on the <HI>Dean</HI>'s Way of treating these Subjects; but this must be after your Return to <HI>London.</HI> Give my humble Service to your Ma∣ma. I wish you both much Pleasure.

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad my last arrived safe, and that you have had the Satisfaction of seeing some Things about <HI>Richmond</HI> worth Observation. I should be pleased if your Mama would let, you stay a lit∣tle longer, as you seem to like it so well; I think too it would be of Service to
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
both your Healths. You may give my Respects, and say I join in the Request that she would grant this Indulgence.</P>
<P>I don't know the Adventures you speak of; but why not buy the Book, if you can∣not borrow or hire it? I would rather you should do so, than have your Curiosity left ungratified; and as I know the pru∣dent Motive that has restrained you from making the Purchase, I beg you will let me be at the Charge of all such Books as you wish should compose your little Library. But you need not be quite so much at a Loss where you are. Mr. O—y has a good Collection of Authors, and if you will ask the Favour, I am sure he will lend you any you desire, or let you come and chuse for yourself. But
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
then you must take great Care of what you have, and regularly return one when you wish for another, otherwise you will find him reluctant. Some Persons would perhaps accuse him herein of being par∣ticular, but it is a Particularity which I have frequently seen; and why should a Compliance with it be deemed hard, since it is no more than is consistent with common good Manners? Lovers of read∣ing very often take up a capricious Fond∣ness for their own Books; and, in Case of an Author being lost, it is not always that a new, and perhaps neater, Edition will make Amends.</P>
<P>I have seen Lord <HI>Cholmondeley</HI>'s fine Room, but it was not finished when I saw it.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="128"/>The <HI>Cloud</HI> was written by Dr. <HI>Sheri∣dan,</HI> I think, but the <HI>Answer</HI> by Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> The latter is, in my Opinion, much the wittiest, so I have sent it en∣closed.</P>
<P>I hope your Stay will be prolonged, for you will not easily forgive yourself, if you do not see <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and the fine Cartoons of the immortal <HI>Ra∣phael.</HI> The Stair-Cafe, and the Beauties of King <HI>William</HI>'s Court, are well worth your Notice, as are the Lodge and Cas∣cade in <HI>Bushy Park. Ham Walks</HI> will also give you great Pleasure, but of ano∣ther Kind. The former will rather raise your Wonder, (I mean the Court and Paintings) the latter inspire with a soft Delight. You will be more at home
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
here, as you are happily possessed of a greater Relish for the humble, than the exalted Scenes of Life. Hence you will feel much Indulgence, I believe, in pass∣ing through my favourite Village, <HI>Ted∣dington.</HI></P>
<P>I have now done with Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> and shall, by way of Foil, send you the <HI>De∣scription of a Lady's Dressing-Room,</HI> which is an Imitation (but far inferior) of the Doctor's Way of Writing; however you may, in some Measure, learn <HI>what to avoid,</HI> by reading it. There are many Things in that Part of <HI>Ovid's Art of Love,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> has translated, worth noticing, in order to a Lady's making herself agreeable, besides the cri∣minal Part. This latter ought to be
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
carefully and judiciously distinguished (and you are very capable of doing it) from the truly-useful and allowable, nay commendable Precepts, which he lays down.</P>
<P>After sending you some few Reflections on <HI>Swift</HI>'s Way of Writing, I will turn to <HI>Horace</HI> next. It is a great Pity that we have never yet had a good Translation of him; but so it is; and indeed he is so difficult to be rightly hit off, that I despair of ever seeing one.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the Pleasure of yours of the 22d instant. No Letters go from this on Saturday, so I could not answer you sooner.</P>
<P>If the Weather prove fair this Week, I suppose you will go to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> where I think you had better stay a Night, that you may see every thing at Leisure. All the Places I wrote you of are in your Way. Let me scheme for you.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132"/>I would go by Water to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> return the next Morning on Foot, (it is a pleasant Walk) through the Park, to <HI>Teddington,</HI> there take Water to <HI>Ham House</HI> and from that walk to <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>Now your Mama and you have got to so pleasant a Spot, methinks I would have you stay some Time. As I said be∣fore, it will improve your Health and Spirits. If you are come abroad with Finances too narrow for this, let me know, and I can give you a Draught on Mr. O—y. He is my Banker; all my Monies go through his Hands, so there is nothing improper or inconve∣nient in it.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="133"/>I am much delighted with your deli∣cate Reasons for declining my Offer of furnishing you with Books; but you are too nice. Any thing in my Power, my dear Nancy, that may contribute either to your Health or Pleasure, I think well bestowed, that is to say, while you are so deserving in every Respect. Per∣haps I might do the same, were your Merit not quite equal to what it is, but not with the same good Will; and I know your Disposition would scorn to be obliged, when you thought you did not deserve the Obligation.</P>
<P>As I told you in my last, Mr. O—y, I am sure, will let you have any Book you desire. If you could find the Life of <HI>Guzman d' Alfarache,</HI> I think it would
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
entertain you. I well remember, when I was young, it entertained me.</P>
<P>I expect to be called to <HI>London</HI> some Time next Month, but am not certain exactly when. You shall know before I set out. Now to what I proposed about Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI></P>
<P>Although <HI>Swift</HI> was a very nice Judge of Mankind, (I mean herein to include both Sexes) and consequently found many Things to censure, and might pos∣sibly, on that Account, have too great a Contempt for the Generality of the World, yet we must not thence con∣clude, that he was either a Man-Hater or a Woman-Hater. He wanted only to correct Vices; and though he launched
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
into personal Satire against many parti∣ticular Men, (who, I believe, deserved it at his Hands) yet I do not remember that he has been guilty of the same against the fair Sex.</P>
<P>In the next Place it may be observed, that he has perhaps painted his Charac∣ters <HI>larger than the Life,</HI> as the Painters phrase it; but this is often necessary, to make the deeper Impression, as Figures larger than the Life must be adopted sometimes in Painting and Statuary, for the very same Purpose, especially when placed at a great Distance. But who∣ever reads his Works attentively, will find that his Characters, though some∣times too strong, are nevertheless per∣fectly natural.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136"/>His Satire or Censure of your Sex has various Sources. It is sometimes drawn from Faults incident to the Sex in gene∣ral; that is to say, Faults, or rather Weaknesses, which Women are more subject to than Men, and which may be said to arise from the Sex itself; for Example, Fear, Whims, and idle Fan∣cies. These, you see, he wishes to era∣dicate from their Minds.</P>
<P>At other Times his Satire arises from Faults, to which your Mode of Edu∣cation exposes you; namely, Affectation, Dissembling, Tittle-Tattle, amusing your∣selves with Trifles of Dress, Colours, Shapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which indeed you are not to be blamed yourselves, but the Persons are, who have had the Care of your Youth.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="137"/>Some Faultinesses which he arraigns, are those that attend certain Times and Places, as Fashions; and I take the <HI>Mo∣dern Lady</HI> to be of this Sort. Others are what this or that particular Woman runs into, which arise out of Affectation or Vanity, and wear, at the same Time, the Semblance of Virtue. Such is the Cha∣racter of <HI>Artimesia.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the Author had some parti∣cular Woman in his View when he drew this Character, <HI>Phryne,</HI> and <HI>Sappho,</HI> &amp;c. so possibly had Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> when he drew <HI>Doris</HI> and <HI>Amoret,</HI> but then they take Care not to expose any one. Of all these, I think <HI>Amoret</HI> the nicest; be∣cause her Faults are hardly distinguish∣able from Virtue, and such as are most
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
likely to impose not only on the World, but even on the Person who has them; and I do say, a Girl of good Sense and a virtuous Disposition, is not in so much Danger of becoming <HI>Phryne</HI> or <HI>Doris,</HI> or even <HI>Artimesia</HI> or <HI>Sappho,</HI> as she is of be∣coming an <HI>Amoret.</HI> The last Stanza of this little Poem, namely,
<Q><L>She likes herself, yet others hates,</L>
<L>For that which in herself she prizes,</L>
<L>And while she laughs at them, forgets▪</L>
<L>She is the Thing which she despises,</L></Q>
is the most judicious and most true Re∣mark I ever read on the Sex, and yet the least noticed. By the bye, it may very often be applied to our Sex as well as yours, and with as much Propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="139"/>Thus you see the <HI>Doctor</HI> has shewn your Sex what they ought to shun, in some Poems, and what they ought to be, in others; namely, in his <HI>Biddy Floyd, a Lady at Court, Stella,</HI> Mrs. <HI>B</HI>——, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear. I shall write you soon some further Thoughts, perhaps to-morrow or next Day; but I am afraid I tire you.</P>

<P>I Have not yet got Time to make a Copy of <HI>The Dressing-Room</HI> for you, but shall do it by the next Post-Day, and then to <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<P>Besides what I mentioned in my last Letter relative to female Faults, there are some which proceed from the Condition of Life. Women, by their Constitu∣tion, by their Frame of Body and Mind, are more formed for Subjection, than Men are. Some People indeed have dis∣puted this, but it has been rather to shew their Wit and Parts, than for any other
<PB N="138" REF="141"/>
Purpose, for the Fact is too evident to be denied. Allowing it to be so, there are then some Temptations which arise from the Condition of the Sex. A Desire of Rule, or perhaps of having their Will, which is as strong in many Women as in Men, naturally incites them to find out some crafty Methods to obtain it. By the Prerogative of our Sex, we go a shorter and more direct Way to work. Some masculine Women do the same, especially when they meet with soft, easy, womanish Men; but, for the most Part, it is otherwise. Women then, I say, who are desirous of Sway, are re∣duced to peculiar Contrivances to obtain it: they must apply to Art and Cunning, to wheedling or teazing, according to the Temper of the Persons they have to
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>
deal with. I do not mean to infer from this, that Women are by Nature more insincere, more cunning, flattering, or more affected than the Men, but that it is only the Condition, whereto the Disadvantage of their Sex reduces them, which is the Source and Origin of such indirect Practices. To confirm this, we may observe that Children, (Boys I mean) wilt do the self same Thing, to obtain what they want from their Parents; so will Servants, or any Inferiors, from their Masters and Superiors. But Women, who have humane and reasonable Hus∣bands, and who are reasonable them∣selves, or are independent, (in either of which Cases the Condition is different from what I before described) are not chargeable with such Subtleties; I say,
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
we do not see them make Use of any of these little, though too often necessary, Arts.</P>
<P>I fear I have tired you. I have dwelt too long on a Subject too grating to a female Ear; I shall therefore only ob∣serve, that some Faults flow from the Sex, (are <HI>generical,</HI> if I may so call them) more arise from Education, but most from their Condition or Station in Life.</P>
<P>I think it is Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> who will not allow that there is such a Thing as mas∣culine and feminine Virtues. What is Virtue in a Man, is so in a Woman, says he. I will not dispute that Opinion, but I believe I may affirm, that there are Virtues, as well as Vices, in general,
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>
more strongly implanted in the one Sex, than in the other; as for Example, Fear, Tenderness, Compassion, &amp;c. in Women, and Intrepidity, Roughness, Hardiness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Men. There are moreover some Faults and Frailties pardonable in the one Sex, which are abominable in the other.</P>
<P>A young Fellow who rambles about, and runs Riot, is easily forgiven; if a young Woman should do so, she is gone at once. As <HI>Rowe</HI> says,
<Q>She sets, like Stars that fall, to rise no more.</Q>
I do not presume to say but that the World is rather unjust to be so indul∣gent on the one Hand, and so severe on the other; but that is no Kind of Alle∣viation
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>
to the young Woman who ex∣poses herself to such Danger.</P>
<P>There are some Instances on the other Hand. If a Woman is frighted at Trifles or Shadows, she is compassionated; a Man so circumstanced, would be ridi∣culed. If Women put on affected Airs, or are over-solicitous about their Dress and Appearance, at worst they are de∣spised perhaps only pitied; but let a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be guilty of such Things, he is detested.</P>
<P>These Hints, my dear, were occa∣sioned by the Poems I sent you. Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may pursue them to a greater Length, and they may serve as useful Warning<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to shew you where your Danger lies an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preserve you from falling into it. To know
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>
where we are most weak, is one Step towards our Security. Every young Per∣son, especially a Female, coming into Life, should nicely observe the Distinction between the Virtues and Vices of both Sexes, and be able to ascertain the respec∣tive Conduct necessary to be pursued.</P>
<P>The Post is just come in, but I have nothing from you. I hope you are well. My next Letter shall be on a quite dif∣ferent Subject.</P>

<P>AT my Return to this Place, my dear Nancy, I received yours of the 13th of July, and yesterday I had another of the 5th instant. I cannot ac∣count for the Letter having been five Days on the Road.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="150"/>Your being taken sick upon your Tour must be both a Disappointment and In∣convenience. I hope however your Dis∣order will not increase. If it should, and you are unable to write, beg your Mama to favour me with a Line, as you may reasonably suppose I shall otherwise be kept in a very uneasy Suspence.</P>
<P>Suffer me here to trouble you with a little Caution, which however I cannot think you stand in Need of. There is an idle Custom, wherein too many of your Sex indulge themselves, which ought to be carefully guarded against; I mean that of complaining for Trifles, and endeavouring to impose a flight In∣disposition for a material Illness. Some
<PB N="148" REF="151"/>
Ladies who follow this Practice, per∣haps would never dream of doing it of their own Accords, but they have seen the Affectation in others, and fancied it became them; thus they are guilty of that through Imitation, which they would never have been through Prin∣ciple. Such Persons draw on themselves one Inconvenience at least, namely, that of not being credited, when they are really ill.</P>
<P>To divert you, I will quote a Pas∣sage out of <HI>Horace,</HI> somewhat similar to this. I own the Translation to be very indifferent, but the Sense is ex∣cellent.</P>
<Q><L>A small Retainer in a great Man's Train,</L>
<L>Who still is asking, and doth still complain,</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="152"/>I want a good Surtout—'tis very cold—</L>
<L>My Trunk is rifled, and I've lost my Gold,</L>
<L>Does like those cheating Punks, who often mourn,</L>
<L>I've lost my little Dog—my Gown is torn—</L>
<L>Until, at last, unheeding the Complaint,</L>
<L>We give no Credit to their real Want.</L>
<L>One that has often been abus'd, grows shy,</L>
<L>He views a Beggar with a heedless Eye,</L>
<L>No Charity bestows, altho' he swears,</L>
<L><HI>By Heav'n,</HI> (and softens ev'ry Oath with Tears)</L>
<L>Believe me, I'm in Want—<HI>and sadly cries,</HI></L>
<L>O cruel! help the poor!—<HI>The Croud replies,</HI></L>
<L>A d'autres, Friend—we know you and your Lies.</L></Q>
<P>I wish there were a good Translation of <HI>Horace,</HI> for your Sake, but it is what I despair of ever seeing: however, I would have you acquainted with him even in such Translation as we have. I will get you the best I can very soon.
<PB N="150" REF="153"/>
He is a Treasure that you would be glad to be possessed of; and though you may relish him but indifferently, as he is given in our Language, yet it is better than not to be acquainted with him at all.</P>
<P>I do not know how long it may be before I see <HI>London.</HI> If you are willing therefore, we will supply the Absence as usual, by Letter, and perhaps to better Advantage than if we were together.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>my dear,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>yours, J. P.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> Since writing the above, I have a Letter from Mr. K—, and one from you, about the Parcel of Snuff you have been so good to send me. I thank you very kindly. Such little Remembrances are endearing, and sometimes more so than material Services; since the latter are generally called out by some occasional Claim of Exigency, whereas the former are the Result of a constant Attention and Inclination to oblige. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> have a pretty Adage, or Proverb, to this Pur∣pose, which means,
<Q>Civility costs little, and gains much.</Q></P>
<P>You ask about the unhappy Acci∣dent, mentioned in the News-Papers. You perceive, by this, that the Disaster
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>
did not befal me. It is true, the poor Servant was drowned, by the Boat oversetting. Mr. L— was got out, without any Damage. I was not in the Boat. I have neither mentioned it in writing, nor talked of it to any one, when I could avoid it. Such Events, I think, are painful to the Hearer as well as the Speaker; for this Reason, I did not hint it to Mr. K—.</P>
<P>A great Concourse of Company is to be at our Races this Week. This Hall will be crouded. The Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI> and his Son, Lord <HI>Boyle,</HI> will lye here; a Brother of Mr. L— from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and many more Gentlemen.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="156"/>Give my hearty Service to your Mama and Aunt; thank them for their kind Concern about me, and write me when you think fitting.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours of the 23d, for which I am much obliged, since it brings me News of your Amendment. It may ap∣pear odd to say, I am now very glad to be informed that you have been <HI>verita∣blement malade</HI>; as I would rather that a
<PB N="154" REF="157"/>
Person, for whom I entertain such a high Esteem, as I do for you, should be lost to Health, than lost to Truth. In such a Case as ours, however, I know the Generality of the World would not call it a Falshood, only an Equivocation; but surely, instead of mending the Matter, this is only making it worse; the Fault is the same, with the Aggravation of Meanness. We see frequent Instances hereof in the common Occurrences of Life, and People are either insensible, or regardless of them. But call the Trans∣gression what by Name you will, still it is such as I thought you incapable of, and am pleased to be confirmed in my Opi∣nion; though by your calling my Quo∣tation from <HI>Horace</HI> a bitter Pill, you cer∣tainly strained it to a Meaning I did not
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
intend you should. I had some Suspi∣cion of this when I wrote it. However, I chose to leave it for you to comment on, and for myself to defend afterwards, which I thus do.</P>
<P>Every Fable has, or may have, a ge∣neral, as well as a particular Applica∣tion. Our Story shews the Danger of People using false Pretences, on various Occasions, and thereby running a Risque of not being believed, when they speak truth. This is the general Moral or Ap∣plication. The particular Moral is spe∣cified in the kept Woman losing her Cre∣dit with her Friend, by pretending eter∣nal Wants and Losses; a Hanger-on with his Retainer; and a Beggar with the Pas∣senger. Now you chose to introduce a
<PB N="156" REF="159"/>
particular Application to your own Ill∣ness, which I thought I had guarded against in my Premisal to the Quotation. It seems you did not think so, and there was no Harm in it; it was but the na∣tural Result of a strong and a nice Feel∣ing; and, were it an Error, I would rea∣dily take it on myself, being, as I am, the Source of it; and again assure you I meant only to amuse, not to reproach you.</P>
<P>I have bought <HI>Horace</HI> for you; but the Translation being very indifferent, many Allusions made to Roman Cus∣toms, and Roman Names of People and Places introduced, I fear it will read very heavily. You would nevertheless find it worth your while to put up with
<PB N="157" REF="160"/>
the former, and be at some extraordinary Pains to make yourself acquainted with the others, for the Sake of the prudent Sayings, Advices, Maxims, and Reflec∣tions, wherewith the Author abounds. In short, you must, for once, be contented with the <HI>utile</HI> without the <HI>dulce,</HI> for the latter is all left behind with the Ori∣ginal. It will somewhat resemble a wholesome Pill, without any Gilding.</P>
<P>There is another Author I want to make you acquainted with, and that is <HI>Longinus on the Sublime.</HI> I will get one for you, and send it with <HI>Horace.</HI> Ob∣serve, my dear, while I am recommend∣ing these to you, I have no Design to induce you to set up for a Critic, or a female Pedant, only to enable you to
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
know the Extent of your own Judg∣ment, and how to correct and regulate it to your Profit and Pleasure. For this Purpose merely it is that I wish to make you acquainted with some of the best Writers of Antiquity, who accu∣rately distinguish between Sense and Non-sense, true and false Wit, Humour and Farce, Sublime and Bombast, a noble Flight and a Rant, a graceful Complaint and an unbecoming Whining.</P>
<P>The melancholy Accident, which you enquire about, happened in the follow∣ing Manner.</P>
<P>We were at a Treat which a new Comer to the Hall gives to the other Students. It
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
was at the celebrated Place, called God-stow where <HI>Fair Rosamond,</HI> the Favourite of Henry II. was buried. A Branch of the Isis runs there, which at <HI>London</HI> is called the <HI>Thames.</HI> There is a Bridge of two Arches; the one was stopped up, in order to catch Fish there, so the whole Stream was thrown into the other. Mr. L— had taken his Servant into his Boat, and was endeavouring to push through the Arch, which he had, at other Times, done without Difficulty; but, on this Occasion, the Impetuosity of the Current suddenly drove the Boat back with great Violence; Mr. L— stumbling against his Servant, they were both thrown for∣cibly on the Edge of the Boat, and oc∣casioned it to be so far overbalanced, as to be filled with Water. Apprehensive
<PB N="160" REF="163"/>
that the Boat would immediately sink, Mr. L— jumped out, and was taken up without the least Harm; but the Servant, staying longer by the Boat, was drove further from the Bank, and being unable to swim, he unfortunately sunk, before the Boat, which took up his Master, could reach him. They once or twice got a Pole under him, but could not save him. I did not see the first Part of the Misfortune, for I was not come out from Dinner, but arrived Time enough to see Mr. L— taken up, and the poor Man lost.</P>
<P>I have gratified your Curiosity, but you need not tell the Story out of your Family. There is something very shocking in the Idea of a poor Creature being snatched
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
thus from Life, in an Instant, and, as <HI>Shakespeare</HI> says,
<Q>With all his Imperfections on his Head,</Q>
and Calamities like these should serve as a Warning to us all, to lead such Lives, as might best enable us to meet such. Deaths, if called on.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have just now received yours of the 26th. Some Mistakes have happened between us about Dates, which we can∣not
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
easily settle, I find, and some Mis∣carriages in the Post, which we cannot repair; therefore I do not hold it worth our while to enter into a Discussion about them. Time ill-employed is worse than Time unemployed, and the last is bad enough in all Conscience.</P>
<P>The entire Occasion of my writing just now is to tell you that I go into the Country, to <HI>Tew,</HI> to-morrow early, and shall not return for two or three Days. When I do, I shall send you <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Longinus.</HI> You are probably thinking of their Arrival now; I therefore hold it necessary to make an Apology for not gra∣tifying the Expectation I have raised. It is, in some Degree, like not paying a Debt which we have voluntarily con∣tracted.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="166"/>You promised to read those Books in the Holy Scriptures, and the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> which I recommended, and to let me have your Thoughts of them. Why do you not so employ yourself now, and write your Thoughts at your Leisure? When you get <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Longinus,</HI> there will be a new Subject of Correspondence. But I do not desire to hurry you. Write, when you find the Spirit of writing upon you, that is, when you find yourself best inclined to it.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JUST now I have the Pleasure of yours. I have been hurried ever since I wrote you last. I am this Even∣ing returned to Town, and must leave it again early to-morrow Morning.</P>
<P>My present Business occasions a second Disappointment in the Books I promised. They cannot come till I return; but, believe me, you should not wait so long for them, if it were in my Power to prevent it. I have known People who made a Point of baulking young Folks
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
of Presents and Enjoyments that had been promised them, from a prudent Design (as they termed it) of inuring them early to Disappointments. I hold it the most dangerous Way of proceed∣ing in the World. Beside that it will never answer the End proposed (for it will be much more likely the Temper should be hurt than improved by it) it is practising Cunning and low Artifice with them; setting them a bad Exam∣ple; for as soon as they are old enough to discover the Means you use, they will be induced to practise the same with you, and endeavour to counteract one Craft by another. Hence they are early se∣duced from the first great Principle of Goodness, Truth, and by Degrees all that is open and ingenuous in the Mind
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
may be quenched, ere they know the Value of it.</P>
<P>If I return on Tuesday, your Books shall be sent on Wednesday; if I do not, you cannot have them till Friday. Wait with Patience till then, and I think you need not wait longer. I be∣lieve <HI>Longinus</HI> will give you great Satis∣faction. Our Correspondence about Books, and Observations on them, has been long interrupted. I care not now how soon it is resumed; but it shall be at your own Choice. I will not hurry you.</P>
<P>I have one Letter more to write about Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Genius, and then I have en∣tirely done with that Subject. I promised,
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
'tis true, to let you have what <HI>Horace</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey,</HI> but as I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o send you the Book itself, that Promise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s superseded.</P>
<P>I wish, for your Sake, that the Trans∣lation were better, or that you under∣stood the Original; I will however assist you as far as I am able, and, in my next Letter, point out some Places, to which I would have you particularly attend.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have now received the Books. <HI>Longinus</HI> is a most admirable Au∣thor, but he will require a deep Atten∣tion in reading. I advise you to observe the Notes as you go along; not leave them till last. When you have made yourself Mistress of them, read the Book through again. This will give you a very competent Knowledge of him, and your Pleasure will be increased in Pro∣portion. A real good Author, you know, like a real good. Man, improves on our
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
Acquaintance. Your own Judgment will suggest to you the most useful and remarkable Places; however, I recom∣mend the 8th, 14th, 17th, 34th, and the two last Chapters. You will give me your Opinion of the whole, in due Time. When you enter upon <HI>Horace,</HI> you must make great Allowance for the Stile, the Measure of his Verse, and yet more for the weak Expression in which the origi∣nal Sense and Meaning is given.</P>
<P>This Minute yours of the 9th. Never delay writing, because Franks are want∣ing. I hold such a Consideration un∣worthy to be put in Balance with a Let∣ter from a Friend. Postage is cheap enough; and your Correspondence is dear to me.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="175"/>I cannot say when I am to be in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> You will have another little Parcel soon, containing some Buckles and other Necessaries, which Mr. K— desired me to procure for him. Please to send them to him, and he will remit the Price; I have advised him what the Amount is. Do me the Favour to accept it, for the Improvement of your little Library. Make such Purchases as Fancy dictates; I will not direct or controul your Choice.</P>
<P>I am concerned for your Mama's Indisposition. I beg to hear about her soon, but desire nothing more from you. I would not be the Means of employ∣ing a Minute of your Time now, which
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
is so essentially necessary to your Care and Attention to her.</P>
<P>I have little Leisure at present; my next shall be longer. When you can return to our usual Custom, why may you not write me in French now and then? The <HI>Archbishop of Cambray's Dia∣logues des Morts,</HI> &amp;c. are excellent; com∣posed of very fine, easy, and familiar French. They deserve to be read often.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the Pleasure of yours of the 13th, and am glad to hear you got the Things safe, and that your good Mama is better. You have one of the greatest Comforts and Blessings of this Life, a good Parent; and indeed you are one of the few young Folks who deserve the Blessing, in-as-much as you are sensible of it, and, by your Conduct towards her, prove you are grateful for it. May it be long continued to you!</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178"/>I hold myself indebted to you for your ready Acceptance of my little Present; it was the most pleasant and grateful Re∣turn you could make me. There is a Delicacy necessary in accepting, as well as conferring a Kindness, which is nicely explained by our <HI>Shakespear.</HI> He makes <HI>Othello</HI> say to <HI>Iago,</HI> (who has sworn to devote himself to his Service)
<Q><L>I greet thy Love</L>
<L>Net with vain Thanks, but with Acceptance boun∣teous.</L></Q>
This Phrase, <HI>bounteous Acceptance,</HI> is libe∣ral beyond defining; it can only be <HI>felt.</HI> What is usually called <HI>Taste,</HI> consists en∣tirely in <HI>Feeling</HI>; and I am not clear that the latter Expression would not be the most proper.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="179"/>I have no Doubt but you will soon get through <HI>Longinus,</HI> and all the Notes. I know your Expedition, therefore wish you to attack him a second Time, be∣fore you transmit me your Opinion. Let me likewise have your Thoughts on <HI>Ho∣race,</HI> the Scriptures, and the Apocrypha, as you go on with them. I shall soon give my additional Letter of Observations on <HI>Swift</HI>'s Mode of writing.</P>
<P>There is a little Publication, called <HI>Dialogues sur l' Eloquence en general, et sur celle de la Chair en particulier, avec une Lettre ecrite à l' Academie Francoise,</HI> by the <HI>Archbishop of Cambray.</HI> It is a most ex∣cellent little Book, and I wish you would endeavour to get it. The Bookseller in <HI>Clare-Court,</HI> I dare say, will find it for
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
you. Read it with the closest Atten∣tion; it deserves you should, for it will assist you in a right Way of thinking and and judging.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> is, or was lately, at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> in <HI>Hampshire.</HI> I hope he will be soon in <HI>London.</HI> But why do you ask?</P>
<P>The Translations you speak of may more properly be called Imitations than Translations; and you will certainly find more Beauty in them, than in <HI>Creech,</HI> though they do not follow the Original so close. I think therefore <HI>Creech</HI> should be your first Object, by way of ground∣ing yourself in the original Meaning of <HI>Horace,</HI> then turn to what you please;
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
in particular, to <HI>Pope</HI>'s Imitations of some of his Epistles and Satires; they will charm you.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Saturday last I sent you a Letter by Dr. <HI>King</HI>'s Servant, which I hope you have received safe.</P>
<P>For these three Months past, I have employed my spare Hours in reading such
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
Authors as have wrote on Poetry; for Example, <HI>Horace, Boileau's and Vida's Art of Poetry, Pope's Essay on Criticism, the Duke of Buckingham's Essay on Poetry, and Lord Roscommon's Essay on translated Verse.</HI> I have also been at the Pains to make Abstracts from them all, and this for two Reasons; first, to make the deeper Impression on my Mind, secondly, to have them to recur to, on Occasion.</P>
<P>As I said once before, I would not have you set up for a Critic; but as Nature has implanted in you a Love and Taste for reading, I could wish you, at this Leisure-Time of your Life, to ac∣quire as right a Judgment as you can of what you read, and be able to converse upon it. But your own Discretion must
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
be your Monitor, not to let these Studies engage your Time and Attention, to the Neglect of such domestic Qualifica∣tions, as your Sex and Situation may hereafter demand.</P>
<P>I have sent you a loose Abstract of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham's Essay,</HI> and, if you desire them, will furnish you with Abstracts of the rest. This may, at first View, appear an useless Trouble to one who has the Originals at Hand, but, in Fact, is not so; it may be of the same Use to you, that it was to me; and you will still have a much stronger Impression of any Rule or Passage, by writing your Remarks to me, or adding what is de∣fective to mine; for, as I did them hasti∣ly,
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
no Doubt, many Things want to be corrected.</P>
<P>Shall I give you a short Character of the Authors I have named?</P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> is always allowed the first Place. Notwithstanding he slides over Things in a short, easy, careless Way, scarce seeming to observe any Order, yet he requires a great deal of Attention. <HI>Roscommon</HI>'s Translation of him is good, though <HI>Oldham</HI>'s loose Manner gives us most Pleasure. This Author has also been translated by <HI>Ben Jonson</HI> and several others.</P>
<P><HI>Vida</HI> stands next. He does not med∣dle with the different Kinds of Poetry,
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
only with Poetry in general, and chiefly applies what he says to the <HI>Epic.</HI> He is more full, regular, and methodical, than any of them. He points out how a Youth of Genius should be trained in the Art of Poetry; and treats of many Things, which none of the others, whom I have named, have touched upon; all in such excellent Verse, and so suited to the Na∣ture of his Subjects, that the Sound is in Reality "an Echo to the Sense." The Original is in Latin. I am not certain whether he has been translated, but will enquire; if he has, I will get him for you; but, at all Events, you must com∣pound for the Loss of his genuine Beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="186"/><HI>Boileau</HI> is very judicious; he takes in all Kinds of Poetry, and borrows a great deal from <HI>Horace,</HI> but is more metho∣dical.</P>
<P><HI>Pope's Essay on Criticism</HI> is a consum∣mate Piece; but it is so concise, that, like <HI>Horace,</HI> he demands close Atten∣tion. He borrows much from the three before-mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Roscommon</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham</HI> are much shorter. They omit many Things which the others mention, but what they have written is finely executed. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> insists most on Dramatic Writing. What he has said, though imperfect, is very judicious, and his Lines are masterly.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187"/>On the whole, I have one Piece of Ad∣vice for you; namely, that you would particularly observe what they have in common with each other. By this Means you will be nearest to the right.</P>
<P>No more, till I hear from you, which I hope will be soon; but pray do not write, when you are in a Hurry.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have, on the other Leaf of this Let∣ter, sent you an Abstract of <HI>Lord Ros∣common's Essay on translated Verse.</HI> If you
<PB N="185" REF="188"/>
will let the Abstract lye by you, while you go through the Work itself, it will assist you to distinguish one Rule from another, and implant them still deeper in your Mind.</P>
<P>This Author will particularly define <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy,</HI> and enable you to form a proper Judgment of them.</P>
<P>I need not observe to you that the first general Qualification necessary in all Kinds of Writing is good Sense. The peculiar Ingredients requisite for Tragedy are Terror and Pity, those for Comedy are Wit and Humour. <HI>Corneille</HI> thought to bring a fourth into Tragedy, namely, Admiration; but it is not by any Means so essential as the former. It will some∣times

have its Effect, and act very agree∣ably on the Mind, but Terror and Pity always have been, and always will be, allowed the main Ingredients.</P>
<P>In like Manner, Wit and Humour are necessary to Comedy. The Prefe∣rence between these is generally given to Humour, and I think very justly. If Humour is that peculiar Mode of think∣ing, and of saying and doing Things, which some Persons possess, and are thereby distinguished from all others, then it must be the chief Ingredient in Comedy. Most People are endued with this Talent in a greater or less Degree; and it is not uncommon to see the Hap∣piness or Unhappiness of Life depend on this peculiar Cast of Mind and of Be∣haviour.
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
<HI>Congreve</HI> has an excellent Letter on Humour in Comedy. Pray read it.</P>
<P>Wit assuredly claims only the second Place. Complaints have been made of too much Wit in some of our Co∣medy-Writers, in <HI>Congreve,</HI> for Instance. If any one merits the Charge, he must be the Man; but I am afraid it is generally rather false Wit, or something mistaken for Wit, which is complained of. There are very few Authors, however, who can be arraigned of this Fault; though I have heard <HI>Terence</HI> and <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the List with <HI>Congreve.</HI></P>
<P>True Wit is hard to be defined. Some call it merely a Propriety of Thoughts and Words; but I think it rather is good
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
Sense well expressed. Others term it an Assemblage of Ideas of very distinct and different Nature, yet capable of being solved into an agreeable and unexpected Likeness. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Comparison of Re∣ligion and Politics to Oil and Vinegar, is an Instance in Point. But I think this ra∣ther a Species, than a Definition of Wit. In my Opinion, Wit consists in an inge∣nious Thought, cloathed in good Phrase, expressed with Liveliness, and creative of Pleasure and Mirth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious and pleasant Friend of mine makes Translation the Test of Wit.

<P>A Comedy with too much Wit in it has been compared to a Suit of Cloaths, so richly embroidered, as to pre∣vent the Ground-Work being seen. I think however it is oftner Tinsel, than Sterling, of which we complain.</P>
<P>It has been objected to <HI>Congreve,</HI> that his very Servants and low Characters are
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
witty. Why should they not be so? Have we not seen such in real Life, especially those who have acquired a little better Sort of Education; <HI>Jeremy</HI> in his <HI>Love for Love</HI> is described to have waited on a Gentleman at <HI>Cambridge</HI>; is there any Wonder such a Servant should be witty; or such as are bred in or near <HI>London,</HI> or in the Neighbourhood of the Court? I do not see why they may not be as witty as their Betters, as they often are.</P>
<P>He is again charged with having writ∣ten bad English. He does so sometimes, but puts it in the Mouth of a low Cha∣racter. He must be a weak Observer indeed, who cannot distinguish between the Character and the Author.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="195"/>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself objects that Congreve's Fools are not Fools;
<Q><L>How seldom do the best succeed!</L>
<L>Tell me if Congreve's Fools are Fools indeed.</L></Q>
In my humble Opinion, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> should have considered that <HI>Congreve</HI> had de∣clared, and justly, against bringing er∣rant Fools on the Stage, that is, such as are created so. Why, for what End bring Persons there, who ought rather to be pitied than exposed? We might as jus∣tifiably reduce deaf or dumb People to Ridicule, as such Fools as these. Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> has an excellent Observation on this Head; he says, the Folly which de∣serves to be exposed, is procured
<Q><L>— — by Expence of Time and Thought,</L>
<L>God never made a Coxcomb worth a Groat,</L></Q>
<PB N="193" REF="196"/>
meaning to imply that Coxcombry must proceed from Vanity, Pride, Affectation, or a wrong Taste,</P>
<P><HI>Congreve</HI> complains that his <HI>Witwou'd,</HI> in the <HI>Way of the World,</HI> was mistaken by the Town for a <HI>True-Wit.</HI> The Er∣ror was wholly theirs. His Judgment was too nice to suffer him to draw gross Fools: his were of a refined Cast, and were Men, who had the Appearance, at least, of something like Men of Sense. Of this Sort are <HI>Tattle, Petulant, Witwou'd,</HI> and <HI>Brisk;</HI> though they are Fools enough at the Bottom; but nevertheless are such to whom we should rather give the Ap∣pellation of Fops or Coxcombs.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197"/>The Objection to <HI>Congreve,</HI> that his Fools are not Fools enough, is not half so bad as if they had been too much so. Surely the Town would not have wished him to have brought either an Ideot or a Lunatick on the Stage. He has indeed brought a Counterfeit-Madman there, and <HI>Ben Johnson</HI> a real Madman, (in his Comedy of <HI>Bartholomew Fair)</HI> but not with an Intent to expose either the one or the other. If we consider the Con∣duct of the Persons I have named, from their first Entrance to the Time they leave the Stage, we shall find them Fools enough in all Conscience. <HI>Petulant</HI> and <HI>Wit∣wou'd,</HI> for Example, can seldom be asun∣der; they speak ill of one another, when apart; they play at Snip Snap, and a rude Sort of bantering one another in Com∣pany,
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>
and even before Strangers. They affect a strange Sort of Cant; there is a kind of Pertness in all they say; their Repartee is lively, but silly and unman∣nerly; they get drunk, and come in that Pickle before their Mistress; they fall into an absurd Fit of wrangling, in which they both speak rank Nonsense; they set up for being very severe upon the Ladies; they give up their Preten∣sions to <HI>Millamant</HI> with as little Reason as they formed them; in a Word, they are a Couple of Coxcombs, approaching towards Wit and Breeding, but in Truth having neither. Instead of good Sense, polite Wit, and genteel Repartee, they have a sort of rude Briskness, and <HI>run the Rig,</HI> as the young Tem∣plars,
<PB N="196" REF="199"/>
and spruce Wits, call this Sort of joking.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 28, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought to have pursued the Sub∣ject of my last Letter two Days ago, but had not Time. I now proceed to enquire what Wit is, and when it may be used with Propriety.</P>
<P>Though I cannot give you a perfect Definition of Wit, (which perhaps is not to be done, the Word being so va∣riously applied) yet I think we may de∣fine in what Shape it generally appears. In the first Place, Wit, in my Opinion,
<PB N="198" REF="201"/>
is good Sense; or, at least, it is founded in good Sense, although there is some∣thing more necessary to constitute it; for Example, Jocoseness, Sprightliness, Ridi∣cule; but above all, Aptness. The Time and Manner of applying it makes great Part of the Merit.</P>
<P>A good Pun passes for Wit, with some Folks, but I fear it is no Way al∣lied to it. A wild Expression carries the same Appearance with others, but if there be not something ingenious in it as well as wild, I doubt it will never de∣serve the Name of Wit.</P>
<P>Wit appears often in a smart Repar∣tee, if made off-Hand; Impromptu's,
<PB N="199" REF="202"/>
as the French call them. These are very entertaining, provided a fair Occasion of∣fers, and the Person, who gives that Oc∣casion, deserves the Smart. The Conver∣sation between <HI>Millamant</HI> and <HI>Marwood,</HI> in <HI>the Way of the World,</HI> is a lively In∣stance hereof. The former retorts on the latter with Abundance of Wit, Humour, and Satire.</P>
<P>I will give you one Instance in a little Story where the Repartee was lively, and severe, and deserved, and immediately took its Rise from what had been said.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Judge Jefferies</HI> was notable at confounding and brow-beating Wit∣nesses, as they call it, especially when
<PB N="200" REF="203"/>
their Testimonies were not agreeable to him. An old reverend Man, with a great Beard, was giving Evidence before him, when <HI>Jefferies,</HI> in Hope to put him out of Countenance, said, <Q>If that Fel∣low's Conscience is as large as his Beard, he may swear what he pleases.</Q> The Witness, taking hold of his Beard, gravely replied, <Q>Nay, my Lord, if you measure Consciences by Beards, your Lordship has none at all.</Q></P>
<P>Thus introduced, Repartee surely me∣rits to be called Wit, and is not only an agreeable, but an useful Talent; but when it is exercised against good-natured, inoffensive People, or such as are in Want or Affliction, it becomes detesta∣ble,
<PB N="201" REF="204"/>
and rather deserves the Name of Cru∣elty. It is indeed as unmanly and cow∣ardly in these Cases, as it would be to assail with Violence one who had not a Weapon to defend himself, or if he had, who possessed neither Strength or Spirits to make Use of it. And yet many such witty Fools are to be found, who chuse to display their Talents on any Subject, rather than lose an Opportunity of shew∣ing them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Young,</HI> in his <HI>Love of Fame,</HI> displays an honest Indignation, at this cruel Use of Wit, with great Energy— <Q><L>Who, for the poor Renown of being smart,</L><L>Would leave a Sting within a Brother's Heart?</L></Q></NOTE>. One Comfort is, that they often feel the ill Effects themselves; for Wit, improperly placed, is as apt to injure the Possessor, as a Gun, by recoiling, to
<PB N="202" REF="205"/>
bruise an injudicious Shooter. Shall I illustrate this by another little Anecdote?</P>
<P>A certain noble Roman was standing for one of their highest Offices; the Con∣sulship, I believe. The Election being popular, the Candidates were obliged to court the Freemen, as is practised in our Country at every Election for a Seat in Parliament. All the Voters were caress∣ed. This Noble was shaking Hands with a poor labouring Man, and per∣ceiving them to be very hard, "Friend," quoth he, with a Sneer, "dost thou walk upon thy Hands?" The Man took the Witticism in Dudgeon, and had Resent∣ment and Interest enough to make the Noble lose his Election.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="206"/>The famous Sir <HI>Thomas Sydenham,</HI> who was an extraordinary great Man in his Way, had so indifferent an Opinion of Wit, that he used to say, "There was almost as great a Difference between Wis∣dom and Wit, as between Something and Nothing." Yet I cannot agree with him. Wit, properly managed and tem∣pered, may be rendered (as I said be∣fore) an agreeable and useful Quality. We should only take Care not to let it get the better of good Sense, good Nature, good Humour, or good Man∣ners.</P>
<P>I am about to send you a Book, which contains the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s and Lord <HI>Roscommon</HI>'s Poems, and the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Reflections on Elo∣quence.
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>

Here∣with you receive a Portion of <HI>Pope</HI>'s Es∣say on Criticism, but I wish you may be able to read it. It was written in a Hur∣ry, and I have not present Leisure to transcribe it afresh.</P>

<P>WIT deals occasionally in various Fi∣gures of Speech, for Example, in Metonymy and Metaphor. As you have now read <HI>Longinus,</HI> I need not ex∣plain those Figures here.</P>
<P>He had Wit, who first called <HI>useless Learning, learned Lumber.</HI> A very learn∣ed Man has been termed a Magazine of Learning; but if that Learning be confused and indigested, they aptly say, his Head is a Lumber-House of Learn∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="209"/>Religious Enthusiasts pretend to, what they call, <HI>inward Light,</HI> as a Warrant to their Belief and Actions; whence <HI>Hudi∣bras</HI> says, with great Wit,
<Q><L>'Tis a dark Lanthorn of the Spirit,</L>
<L>Which none see by, but those that bear it;</L></Q>
intimating that their pretended Light, if it were useful at all, was not so to any but themselves.</P>
<P>But Wit deals most in Similies; that is, in drawing Likenesses between Things of a different Nature; and the more surprizing and unexpected those Like∣nesses are, and by how far the Things compared differ in their Kinds, by so much more is the Wit prized. There is one of this Kind in <HI>Hudibras,</HI> which
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
has been much admired, and often quoted. Speaking of People, who are truly loyal, even in Disgrace and Afflic∣tion, he says,
<Q><L>For Loyalty is still the same,</L>
<L>Whether it win, or lose the Game,</L>
<L>True as the Dial to the Sun,</L>
<L>Altho' it be not shin'd upon.</L></Q>
It is in Similies chiefly that most of our Poets, who deal in Wit, or pretend to it, have run Riot. What a Flood of them do we sometimes meet in Dramatic, and other Writers, introduced and pursued, without Rhyme or Reason! Every thing talked of is "like this," or "like that." Except a Simile be exceedingly well hit off, it had better be unattempted. Me∣tonymy and Metaphor (which are indeed
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
but concealed Similies) are, in my Opi∣nion, an easier and genteeler Conveyance of our Ideas.</P>
<P>There is an admirable Sneer on these Strings of Similies, which some Authors are so fond of, in <HI>Swift</HI>'s Introduction to <HI>The Tale of a Tub.</HI> "Wisdom," says that admirable Writer, <Q>is a Fox, who, after long hunting, will, at last, cost you the Pains to dig out. It is a Cheese, which, by how much the richer, has the thicker, the homelier and the coarser Coat; and whereof, to a judicious Palate, the Meggots are the best. It is a Sack-Posset, wherein the deeper you go, you will find it the sweeter. Wisdom is a Hen, whose Cackling we must value and consider,
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
because it is attended with an Egg. But then, lastly, it is a Nut, which, unless you chuse with Judgment, may cost you a Tooth, and pay you with nothing but a Worm.</Q></P>
<P>Had <HI>Swift</HI> been in earnest in these Similies, he would, at best, have appeared whimsically ridiculous; but, in-as-much as he meant them a Satire on Simile-Mongers in general, he is most unques∣tionably witty; and the whole Air and Turn of the Introduction being facetious, nothing could be better suited to the Character of the Writer.</P>
<P>An Author should therefore well con∣fider, in whose Mouth to put his Simi∣lies. That will do well for one Person,
<PB N="210" REF="213"/>
which will, by no Means, suit another. I suppose <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Comparison of Re∣ligion and Politics to Oil and Vinegar, to be as witty as ever was said on any Occasion; yet because there is something wild in it, he has properly put it into the Mouth of a Madman, at least, a Cha∣racter that appears so.</P>
<P>In the same Comedy, <HI>Jeremy</HI> contrives to beguile <HI>Tattle</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Frail</HI> into a Match with each other, when each was on the Hunt for a Fortune elsewhere. <HI>Ben,</HI> a rough Sailor, compares them hereon to a Couple of Privateers, who were looking out for a Prize, and fell foul of each other. This is admirably hu∣morous and witty in itself, but derives double Beauty and Force from the Sailor's speaking it.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="214"/>I shall conclude this Letter with a Transcript from the famous Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> where he treats of the Difference between Wit and Judgment.</P>
<P>"If in having our Ideas in the Me∣mory, ready at Hand, consists Quickness of Parts, in this of having them uncon∣fused, and being able nicely to distin∣guish one Thing from another, where there is but the least Difference, con∣sists, in a great Measure, the Exactness of Judgment and Clearness of Reason, which is to be observed in one Man, above another. And, perhaps, hence may be given some Reason of that common Ob∣servation, that Men, who have a great deal of Wit and prompt Memories, have not always the clearest Judgment or
<PB N="212" REF="215"/>
deepest Reason. For <HI>Wit</HI> lies most in the <HI>Assemblage of Ideas</HI>; and putting these together with Quickness and Variety, wherein can be found any Resemblance and Congruity, thereby to make up pleasant Pictures and agreeable Visions in the Fancy. <HI>Judgment,</HI> on the con∣trary, lies quite on the other Side, in separating carefully, one from another, Ideas, wherein can be found the least Difference, thereby to avoid being misled by Similitude, and by Affinity to take one Thing for another.</P>
<P>"This is a Way of proceeding quite contrary to Metaphor and Allusion; wherein, for the most Part, lies that Entertainment and Pleasantry of <HI>Wit,</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="216"/>
which strikes so lively on the Fancy, and therefore so acceptable to all People, because its Beauty appears at first Sight, and there is required no Labour of Thought to examine what Truth or Rea∣son there is in it. The Mind, without looking any further, rests satisfied with the Agreeableness of the Picture, and the Gaiety of the Fancy; and it is a kind of Affront to go about to examine it by the severe Rules of Truth and good Rea∣son; whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly con∣formable to them."</P>
<P>I would have you, my dear Nancy, con∣sider attentively this Distinction between Wit and Judgment. It is the best phi∣losophical
<PB N="214" REF="217"/>
Account of them that ever I met; though perhaps this Definition does not reach to Wit in its utmost Extent, at least, in the Sense of the Word, as used at present, and thence comes it so hard to be defined or described. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> himself seems indeed somewhat sensible of this, for he, you perceive, always speaks with a sort of Exception and Doubt, as, <HI>in a great Measure—perhaps —for the most part,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I believe I shall have something more for you on this Subject the next Time I write, and then I shall quit it.</P>
<P>I have bespoke <HI>Vida</HI> for you in English, and all <HI>Pope</HI>'s Epistles in Verse, among which are his Imitations from <HI>Horace.</HI>

<PB N="216" REF="219"/>
of Wit and Humour; I shall only add, that, after all that can be said of them, they can only be considered as the Sea∣soning of Comedy. The great Standard of all is good Sense, with Discernment, Judgment, and a thorough Knowledge of Mankind.</P>
<P>These must appear in the Plot, Con∣struction, and Conduct of a Play; in the Sentiments; in the Manners; in the Characters; and in the Propriety of the Diction: our Vices, our Affections, and Passions; our Humours, Weaknesses, and Follies, as well as their Contraries, ought to be well understood, coloured, and expressed. Then all are to be sea∣soned with Wit and Humour, in an easy and just Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="220"/>As for the Unities of Action, Time, and Place, which the Antients insist upon so strongly, especially that of Action, the best that can be said in their Behalf (in my Opinion) is, that it is better to have them, than be without them; for a Play, if it is not good in itself, will not become so, for the Unities being ever so religi∣ously observed. We have many Plays extant, where they are all kept to the utmost Nicety, and yet the Pieces alto∣gether are not worth a Perusal.</P>
<P>There are also Dramatic Productions, wherein the Rules are wholly set aside, which are the Admiration of every Reader of the most refined Taste. Our inimitable <HI>Shakespeare</HI> stands an Example of this, against all the cold Observers of Accura∣cy, that ever did, or ever will exist.</P>

<PB N="225" REF="228"/>
appears unintelligible, the Poem itself will clear it up. To that I refer you. I have already given my Reasons, why I send Extracts from a Poem, which you have at Hand.</P>
<P>I will be more particular as to those Reasons, that you may be very clear in my Meaning—</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, think that I might have spared myself the Pains of transcribing, and you the Pains of reading these Abstracts. But, in my Opinion, they will be of some, and even of more Use than if you had not the Books. All the Heads are but short Hints and Items, which would be of little Service without the Authors, at
<PB N="226" REF="229"/>
large. The Authors explain and en∣force what is in my little Abridg∣ments, and those very Abridgments impress deeper in your Mind what the Author has said. They reciprocally aid each other. The Abstracts serve yet further to sort the different Heads and Precepts, and to range them in order; so that you may thereby obtain a distinct and well-disposed View of them all at once.</P>
<P>You shall next have an Abstract from <HI>Boileau.</HI> These are all to be read with great Care; and I must warn you that there are several Errors in the Printing, especially in <HI>Pope</HI>'s Epistles, and in the Essays of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and
<PB N="227" REF="230"/>
<HI>Roscommon.</HI> Those you must notice, and correct, as they occur.</P>
<P><HI>Faucheur</HI> is an excellent Book. As I told you formerly, I am not for your setting up for a Critick, but I would have you attain to a just Idea of the Nature and Excellencies of fine Writ∣ting, and to form a right Judgment; towards which it is with great Plea∣sure that I contribute, from time to time, such Assistance as lies within my poor Ability. Write to me on Receipt of the Box.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope you have received your Books safe, and found the Letter which was with them in the Box.</P>
<P>I here send you an Abstract of <HI>Boileau</HI>'s Art of Poetry, as I did of <HI>Vida</HI> there. I have two or three Things to recommend to you in reading these Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="232"/>In the first Place, you should con∣sider the great Rules, on which the Rest depend, and which are laid down by all, or, at least, the major Part of these Critics. These great Rules may be thus comprehended;</P>
<P>Good Sense is the Foundation of all good Writing.</P>
<Q><L>Chuse Subjects fit for your Genius.</L>
<L>Never depart from Nature.</L></Q>
<P>In the next Place, observe such Rules as are in few, or but in one of these Authors. These are more likely to escape your View, and therefore should be more carefully searched for, and attended to.</P>
<PB N="228" REF="233"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="229" REF="234"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<P><PB N="230" REF="235"/>You should not run over these Rules carelessly, and in a cursory Manner, but deliberately, both with Attention and Application.</P>
<P>Sometimes reflect, at Leisure, upon one Rule or Head, sometimes upon another, and endeavour to account to yourself for the Reason of such Rule. If you cannot clearly satisfy yourself, ask some Person, or write to me. It may be no unprofitable, nor unpleasant Diversion to enter on a Disquisition of that Kind.</P>
<P>One Caution, by the Bye. Do not load your Head with all these Rules lumbered together in a confused, indi∣gested Heap, but strive to understand them clearly and minutely by a pa∣tient,
<PB N="231" REF="236"/>
and leisurely Attention, and you will reap the Fruit of them in due Time.</P>
<P>When you cannot see quite through the Reason of any Proposition, and yet are desirous to account for it by your∣self, rather suspend your Search, than re∣main content with a poor imperfect So∣lution of the Difficulty; of all Things, never rest satisfied with Absurdities, which many Persons are too apt to do, some from Oversight, some from, mere Lazi∣ness. Such Errors are attended with a double Disadvantage. In the first In∣stance, no Progress is made, in our Stu∣dies; in the next, the Time is lost, which might have been employed to some Pur∣pose.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237"/>The Books, which I have sent you, have, I believe, many Errata, or Mis-Printings in them; a due Observation of the Advice given above, will not only enable you to discover those, but also to supply the true Meaning of the Author.</P>
<P>Remember that, next to Epic Poetry, Tragedy and Comedy are the great Spe∣cies of Writing. Tragedy indeed is it∣self a Species of the <HI>Epic.</HI> I do not re∣commend them to you merely that you should <HI>read Plays,</HI> (according to the Ac∣ceptation of dissipated People, who pass, or rather waste an idle Hour, over what they neither comprehend nor retain) but as <HI>moral Treatises</HI>; for no dramatic Works, but what have this Tendency,
<PB N="233" REF="238"/>
answer the Ends they were designed for, or are worth your Attention.</P>
<P>I could wish you would improve your∣self in reading; it is a nice Art, and known but to few. You promise, I think, to excel in it. When engaged in a Poem, you would do well to repeat aloud sometimes. It is of Service to the Breath, if not done to Excess, and will be of great Use; for many Errors will be discovered by the Ear, that are come at by no other Means. For the Rules of Pronunciation, <HI>Le Faucheur</HI> is the best Instructor extant among the Mo∣derns.</P>
<P>But all these Rules, however well un∣derstood, will be of small Use, without
<PB N="234" REF="239"/>
knowing the great Models from which these Rules are drawn; you should there∣fore read the best Authors in the different Sorts of Poetry.</P>
<P>The Antients lay down these three Things necessary to perfect us in any Sci∣ence; first,
<Q>Art—that is, Precept or Rule;</Q></P>
<P>Imitation— that is, an Endeavour to study the best Models, and follow their Manner; and,
<Q>Exercitation—namely, Practice.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Vida,</HI> as you may observe, is the most regular of all these Essayists. His first Book is on
<Q><PB N="235" REF="240"/>Invention, or the Provision of Matter;</Q>
the next is</P>
<P>The Disposition, or Well-ordering of that Matter;</P>
<P>the third is</P>
<P>The Beautifying and Adorning of that Matter.</P>
<P>These are the three great Points to be observed not only in Poetry, but in Ora∣tory; and in almost every Art and Sci∣ence, as Painting, Sculpture, Building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 22d, and an∣swered it forthwith, but have kept the Answer by me, having been in hourly Expectation of a Recruit of Franks, and they are but now arrived. You have neglected to notice one or two Circum∣stances, which I enquired about. I wish you would always place the Letter be∣fore you, which you are about to answer, and answer Correspondents as soon as you can after you hear from them. What you thus say while the Feelings are
<PB N="237" REF="242"/>
and lively, though contained in six Lines alone, is worth a whole Vo∣lume, that is damped by the Coldness of Delay.</P>
<P>I never read <HI>Cleveland,</HI> but am told it is an excellent Book, and shews <HI>les Plis et les Replis de Coeur humain</HI> very agreeably and accurately.</P>
<P>I think you should read <HI>Vida</HI> first very carefully; then <HI>Horace</HI>; next to him <HI>Boi∣leau</HI>; then <HI>Pope</HI>'s Criticism, <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and <HI>Roscommon,</HI> progressively. The Arch∣bishop of <HI>Cambray</HI> and <HI>Le-Faucheur,</HI> may come in last.</P>
<P>Such Particulars as are treated by more than one of them, ought to be compared, after you have gone through the Au∣thors.
<PB N="238" REF="243"/>
For Example, I would have you collect and compare all they have said upon Epic Poetry together; upon Ode, Satire, Tragedy, and Comedy; and when you have Leisure, write a sort of Abridg∣ment of them, for your own Use.</P>
<P>You should make yourself a perfect Mistress of the principal Figures of Speech; such as Metaphor, Simile, Al∣legory, Metonymy, Irony, <HI>&amp;c. Con∣greve</HI>'s Letter on Humour is a most ad∣mirable Piece. The Preface, or Intro∣tion to <HI>Joseph Andrews,</HI> about Ridicule, is well worth considering. <HI>Fielding</HI> is an excellent Judge of Nature and Mankind. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Epistle to Sir <HI>Richard Temple,</HI> on Affectation, and another, under the Name of <HI>Cobham,</HI> are equally excellent.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="244"/>I am heartily sorry you do not under∣stand Latin, on many Accounts; among the rest, that you cannot read <HI>Vida</HI> in the Original. Though the Translation must be allowed pretty good, yet there is no coming up to the Beauties of the Author's Lines.</P>
<P>If I mistake not, <HI>Cleveland</HI> is a Ro∣mance; there may, perhaps, be some Truth in it; but I never read nor heard of a natural Son of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s under that Name, which, had the Story been true, must have been known long before now.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 27th in due Course. I have written to you on so many Subjects, that I am almost ex∣hausted; and latterly you have not entered into what I have said sufficiently to give me a Handle for proceeding. It is true, I cannot but admit your Excuse, in Part, to wit, your having so much to do during your Mother's Indisposition. Your At∣tion to her must create you full Employ∣ment, and you are right not to let any Consideration interrupt that pious Care.
<PB N="241" REF="246"/>
I most heartily acquit you from the Use of Pen and Ink, till you are at better Leisure, and will, in the mean Time, endeavour to give you Amusement.</P>
<P>I thought to have said something about Figures in Writing, but you now have <HI>Longinus</HI> and <HI>Vida,</HI> who explain them much better than I can.</P>
<P>In a Letter I wrote you lately, I ob∣served there is a great deal of Satire in true Comedy. I have now to add, that there is a great deal of Irony in Satire. This is a very extensive Figure, and con∣verts itself into many Shapes. Sometimes it is direct, pointed, and sharp; some∣times it appears in the Shape of Praise. It occasionally counterfeits Love, Pity,
<PB N="242" REF="247"/>
Fear, in short, what not? Sometimes it lurks in Metaphor, Allegory, Compari∣son, Fable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> has varied it so many Ways, and all so naturally and pleasantly, that the Study of his Works, especially <HI>The Tale of a Tub,</HI> and the Pieces bound up with it, gives us a bet∣ter Idea of true Irony, in all its Branches, than any Description is capable of af∣fording.</P>
<P><HI>The Tale of a Tub</HI> has represented the Fopperies and Absurdities of the Roman Catholic Tenets more glaringly than the gravest Discourse in the World could have done, and that under a Story taken from common Life. In that Author's other Works, he has exposed an hundred Fol∣lies in so droll a Manner, that they strike
<PB N="243" REF="248"/>
us in that Way beyond the Power of the most solemn Essay or Declamation. How has he exposed all Kinds and Degrees of Vain-Glory and Affectation, by imi∣tating the very Fault he is exposing! In how contemptible and just a Light has he placed the Custom of punning, of talking always proverbially, and all idle Discourse, in his <HI>Polite Conversation!</HI> In short, it is needless to say more than that the whole Art of Ridicule is to be learned from Swift.</P>
<P>The only Addition I have to make to this Subject, is to quote you one Instance of Irony from the Holy Scriptures, which I think as strong and as just as any I ever read. It is in Ridicule of the Priests of <HI>Baal,</HI> who was a false God; an Idol,
<PB N="244" REF="249"/>
and no more. His Priests invoked him to perform a Miracle. <HI>Elijah</HI> mocketh them. The Reasons which he assigns for their God not answering their Interces∣sions, are the severest Piece of Raillery imaginable.</P>
<P>"Cry aloud," says he, <Q>for he is a God; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a Journey; or, peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</Q></P>
<P>All which Charges being so unworthy of a God, the Raillery is conceived, in its full Force, the Moment the Prophet opens his Mouth, and must be under∣stood by the most ordinary Capacity. The whole Chapter is worth your read∣ing.
<PB N="245" REF="250"/>
It is the 18th of the first Book of <HI>Kings.</HI></P>
<P>I do not recollect if I ever mentioned to you the 58th Chapter of <HI>Isaiah.</HI> If I did, you have not noticed it in any of your Letters; if I did not, I now re∣commend it to you. It is admirable, as far as respects the Subject itself; but the Disposition of the Chapter, the Repeti∣tions, the Emphasis and Energy, and the many Figures introduced, make it admirably worth your Notice. The Chap∣ter is still more excellent, in-as-much as it is full of strong Figures, yet appears exceedingly simple and plain. This is the great Beauty of Diction, when the Figures are so naturally brought in, that
<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
we feel their Effect, before we perceive them. They strike unseen.</P>
<P><HI>Dryden</HI> says, <Q>Figures ought to be worked into a Discourse, as if they were Part of the Tissue itself, not em∣bossed upon it.</Q></P>
<P>The Allusion is excellent, and the Ob∣servation just.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours of the third of this Month. You have not yet entered into any of the late Subjects I wrote to you about, but your former Excuse, I presume, still exists, and it is too strong to be op∣posed.</P>
<P>It is not material whether you ever read <HI>Polite Conversation</HI> again or no; the Moral of that Satire is too obvious to re∣quire much Attention, it being designed only to ridicule the insipid Conversation
<PB N="248" REF="253"/>
that passes too ordinarily among the most fashionable People. And can it well be wondered at, when so little Attention is paid to the Education of Children, whether Male or Female, in higher Life? <HI>To qualify them for Company</HI> (such is the fashionable Phrase) is the chief Object of Parents in that Style; that is, to make a Bow, dance a Minuet, and play at Cards. The two first I acknowledge to be agreeable, and even necessary Quali∣fications, provided they are accompanied with something intrinsic. But while so much Care is employed in gracing the Outside, surely some little might be used in cultivating the Mind. Perhaps <HI>Master</HI> is sent to some public Seminary, and <HI>Miss</HI> to a Boarding-School; at both which Places, I am sorry to say, the moral Part
<PB N="249" REF="254"/>
of Education is the last attended to, if it be at all. They are quickly launched into Life (poor Souls!) and possibly to the most important State of Life, Matri∣mony, (as Family-Purposes and Interests lead, or rather, too often mislead) with∣out a single Idea to bless themselves with, or even knowing that there is such a Thing as a <HI>Mind</HI> to inspire and regulate their earthly Composition.</P>
<P>The Reason for calling <HI>The Tale of a Tub</HI> by that Name, is, I think, pretty plain. We call any idle, romantic Story, <HI>A Tale of a Tub,</HI> and if this Story of <HI>Swift</HI>'s were to be taken in a literal Sense, none ever more justly deserved the Name.</P>

Besides the Beauty of his Stile, the Worth, Weight, and Importance of his Subject, besides these I say, the Order, Disposition, and Method of his Poem, is admirable; preferable, in my Opinion, to all the rest.</P>
<P>You should read <HI>Boileau</HI> with great Care, and make the same Use of your Abstracts with them all. Have you yet got a thorough Conception of the prin∣cipal Figures in Rhetoric and Poetry, the chief, I mean, which I pointed out to you? I hope to have an Answer to this Question soon, and your Observa∣tions on those Passages in the Holy Scrip∣tures which I recommended. Your Let∣ters

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the Pleasure of yours of the 10th. You say there are some Fi∣gures, which you do not, in any wise, understand. Add to <HI>Longinus, Vida</HI>'s Discourse on this Point, in his third
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>
Book, and you must acquire a due No∣tion of the principal Figures or Tropes, both in Poetry and Rhetoric. Metaphor is the chief of all; and even the princi∣pal Figures, next to Metaphor, are but Species or Branches of it.</P>
<P>A Metaphor is the Use of a Word in a borrowed Sense. The principal Pro∣perties and Uses of it, are,</P>
<P>First, to express Things for which we have not suitable Words or Phrases;</P>
<P>Secondly, to express them so strongly, as to convey deep and agreeable Im∣pressions;</P>
<P>Thirdly, to give us the Representation and Resemblance of two Things at once.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="260"/>In short, it is like a Picture, where the Resemblance to the Thing painted gives us the chief Pleasure.</P>
<P>Near the Beginning of the third Book of <HI>Vida</HI>'s Art of Poetry, there is this glo∣rious Description of Metaphor:
<Q><L>See how the Poet banishes with Grace</L>
<L>A native Term to give a Stranger Place!</L>
<L>From diff'rent Images, with just Success,</L>
<L>He cloaths his Matter in the borrow'd Dress;</L>
<L>The borrow'd Dress the Things themselves ad∣mire,</L>
<L>And wonder whence they drew the strange At∣tire;</L>
<L>Proud of their ravish'd Spoils, they now disclaim</L>
<L>Their former Colour and their genuine Name,</L>
<L>And, in another Garb more beauteous grown,</L>
<L>Prefer the foreign Habit to their own.</L></Q>
<PB N="254" REF="261"/>
After producing some beautiful Instan∣ces where the Metaphor is thus happily introduced, he proceeds, and illustrates his Sentiment with a Simile, which deserves our highest Admiration;
<Q><L>Pleased with the borrow'd Charms, the Rea∣ders find</L>
<L>A Crowd of diff'rent Images combin'd,</L>
<L>Rise from a single Object to the Mind.</L>
<L>So the pleas'd Trav'ller from a Mountain's Brow</L>
<L>Views the calm Surface of the Seas below,</L>
<L>Tho' wide beneath the floating Ocean lies,</L>
<L>The first immediate Object of his Eyes,</L>
<L>He sees the Forests tremble from within,</L>
<L>And gliding Meadows paint the Deeps with green;</L>
<L>While to his Eyes the fair Delusions pass</L>
<L>In gay Succession thro' the watry Glass.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="262"/>We have no adequate Words in our Language to express the Intenseness of Love, or the Extravagance of any vio∣lent Passions; for which Reason it is very common to make use of Metaphor in our usual Discourse; for Example, we <HI>burn</HI> with Love—we are <HI>inflamed</HI> with Rage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We say of a Man who is of a kind Disposition, that he has a <HI>warm</HI> Heart, of one otherwise disposed, that he has a <HI>cold,</HI> or a <HI>hard</HI> Heart. We <HI>melt</HI> into Tears; we <HI>sink</HI> with Grief; we <HI>swell</HI> with Anger; our Hearts <HI>leap</HI> with <HI>Joy</HI>; we <HI>die</HI> with Fear; and so on. <HI>Virgil,</HI> describing <HI>Dido</HI> concealing her Love, says,
<Q>She <HI>feeds</HI> within her Veins a Flame unseen.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="263"/>In the Holy Scriptures these metapho∣rical Expressions are frequently met. God <HI>hides</HI> his Face, or <HI>shines</HI> upon us, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Hide</HI> thy Face from my Sins, and <HI>blot</HI> out all my Misdeeds.</P>
<P>Let thy Mercy <HI>shine</HI> upon us!</P>
<P>Lift up the <HI>Light</HI> of thy Countenance upon us.</P></Q>
<P>In other Instances, where we use Me∣taphors to express Things with more Strength, and make a deeper Impression, for a <HI>dull</HI> Discourse, we say a <HI>cold, life∣less</HI> Discourse. A Poet, instead of tell∣ing us, the Side-Board <HI>was filled</HI> with Plate, says,
<Q>The Side-Board <HI>groan'd</HI> with Plate.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="264"/>Metaphor is sometimes used to bring the Thing, from which it is borrowed, before our Eyes, that we may enjoy the Beauty of the Similitude. <HI>Cowley</HI> says,
<Q>The beechen Bowl <HI>foams</HI> with a <HI>Flood</HI> of Wine;</Q>
<HI>and</HI> Pope,
<Q>A <HI>Tide</HI> of Trojans <HI>flow,</HI> and fill the Place.</Q>
What a beautiful Resemblance is this! It not only presents us with the Idea of a great Crowd breaking into an Intrench∣ment, but likewise with that of a raging Sea breaking over its Banks; and to add to both, conveys the perfect Resemblance which each bears to the other.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Metaphor of a Meta∣phor is made use of; for Example, we
<PB N="258" REF="265"/>
usually call a <HI>dull</HI> Preacher a <HI>heavy</HI> Preach∣er. <HI>Pope</HI> carries this Word <HI>heavy,</HI> which in itself is a Metaphor, to a Metaphor be∣yond it, where he says, in his new <HI>Dunciad,</HI> — — — leaden Gilbert <HI>preach'd. Heavy</HI> is a metaphorical Expression for <HI>dull,</HI> and <HI>leaden</HI> for <HI>heavy.</HI></P>
<P>I will trouble you no further, till I know whether you chuse I should thus proceed to perfect you in the Knowledge of Figures; if you do, I shall bring you acquainted with the rest of the metapho∣rical Family, their Relations, and De∣scendants.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot conceive how much you have pleased me, in submitting to so unentertaining a Subject for a Letter, rather than be without Instruc∣tion. It is but undergoing a little dis∣agreeable Labour now, to reap the Plea∣sure hereafter; for that you certainly will; and without a thorough Knowledge of the Grounds of Rhetorick, the most elegant Author or Orator can never take a proper Possession of you.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267"/>You ask, in your last, about Polyp∣totes, and Gradations; I shall therefore make them the Subject of this Letter.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Names are <HI>Polyptoton,</HI> and <HI>Climax,</HI> which are both Greek Words. I need not here insert what <HI>Longinus</HI> says of them, but refer you to him. I shall only observe that, beside the Substitution of one Number or Tense for another, (which is the <HI>Polyptoton</HI>) or rather the Licence of so doing, there is often great Beauty in it; especially in the Greek and Latin Languages, and chiefly in the former, owing to the Variety of Terminations in their Verbs and Nouns. The French Lan∣guage too exceeds ours in this parti∣cular,
<PB N="261" REF="268"/>
though it falls very short of the other two.</P>
<P>That you may clearly understand what I mean, take the following Example in French.</P>
<Q>Si vous m'aviez aimé autant que je vous aime, je vous aimerois mieux que Personne; mais vouliez vous que je vous aimasse, quand vous ne m'aimiez pas?</Q>
<P>Do you not here perceive a beautiful Variety in the Persons and Tenses? Take the same in English, and you will dis∣cover a total Want of it.</P>
<Q>If you had loved me as well as I love you, I would have loved you better than any Person; but would you
<PB N="262" REF="269"/>
have had me love you, when you did not at all love me?</Q>
<P>Here you see nothing but <HI>love</HI> and <HI>loved</HI> all along, and this, I presume, explains what I mean.</P>
<P>The Climax is a noble and beau∣tiful Figure, when managed with∣out Affectation. We ascend from one Step to another, building, as it were, something on something laid down be∣fore, till we come to the great Point, at which we aim. I will give you two Instances, one on a ludicrous, the other on a solemn Subject. How excellently is the Tumult and Confusion increased in the Poem of the <HI>Alley,</HI> (which I sent you some Time since) from a Girl's Whim∣pering
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
to a Boy's roaring, Dogs barking, Vixens scolding, and Swine grunting! Again, How beautiful is the Gradation of Distress in <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Pastora!</HI></P>
<Q><L>No more the Nymphs shall with soft Tales delight,</L>
<L>Her Ears—no more with Dances please her sight;</L>
<L>Nor ever more shall Swain make Song of Mirth,</L>
<L>To bless the joyous Day, that gave her Birth:</L>
<L>Lost is that Day, which had from her its Light,</L>
<L>For ever lost with her, in endless Night;</L>
<L>In endless Night, and Arms of Death she lies,</L>
<L>Death in eternal Shades has shut Pastora's Eyes.</L></Q>
<P>This Figure, you may observe by the foregoing Example, is generally accom∣panied by Repetition. I will add one more Instance from the great <HI>Tillotson,</HI> not only to illustrate this Figure, (which indeed it does to an Excellency) but also
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
for the Beauty, Justness, and Utility of the Observation.</P>
<Q>After we have practised good Ac∣tions a while, they become easy; and when they are easy, we begin to take Pleasure in them, and when they please us, we do them frequently; and by Frequency of Acts, a Thing grows into a Habit; and a confirmed Habit is a second Kind of Nature; and so far as any Thing is natural, so far it is necessary, and we can hardly do otherwise; nay we do it many Times, when we do not think of it.</Q>
<P>You will observe that this great Master of Eloquence avoids repeating the same Word too literally, but uses a Sort of Variation, to give a greater Beauty to
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
his Discourse, and to avoid seeming af∣fected, to which Censure an exact Re∣petition would probably have exposed him.</P>
<P>The Omission of Copulatives adds much Grace to a Discourse, on some Occasions, particularly in Haste or Passion; for Instance, <HI>Go—run—fly—be quick,</HI> &amp;c. and on others, great Beauty is derived from their being multiplied. The Quo∣tation, I have already made from the Arch-Bishop, wherein the Word <HI>and</HI> is found no less than six Times, renders it unnecessary to seek further for an Ex∣ample.</P>
<P>I may probably take another Oppor∣tunity to enlarge somewhat further on
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
these two opposite Figures. I hope to see you about Christmas.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxford,</HI> <DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 27, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you now understand a Meta∣phor, I shall say no more on that Head, but consider the Figures, which
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
are near a-kin to it. These are, Meto∣nymy, Synecdoche, Hyperbole, Irony, Simile, Allegory, Fable, and Cata∣chresis.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, let me transcribe a Passage out of <HI>Blackwell</HI>'s new Intro∣duction to the Classics, with a little Ad∣dition. You may get Acquaintance with this odd Family, through his Means, I dare say. He is intimate with them.</P>
<P>There is a general Analogy and Re∣lationship between all Tropes; and in all of them we use a foreign or strange Word, instead of one that is proper. Hence we sometimes say one Thing, and mean another quite different; but this is not always the Cafe. These
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
Tropes, like other Relations in Life, are some nearer, some farther removed.</P>
<P>When we advance one Thing, and then say some other, which has a near Affinity to it, it is a Synecdoche.</P>
<P>When we say one Thing, and mean another mutually depending, it is a Metonymy.</P>
<P>When we say one Thing, and mean the very opposite, it is Irony.</P>
<P>When we say one Thing, and mean another like to it, it is a Metaphor.</P>
<P>A Metaphor long continued is an Allegory.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276"/>An Allegory turned into a Story is called a Fable, and in the Scripture-Language is a Parable.</P>
<P>When a Metaphor is carried into a great Degree of Boldness it is an Hy∣perbole; and when it is far-fetched, or carries some Impropriety in it, 'tis a Catachresis.</P>
<P>The Metaphor is the Source and Foun∣tain of them all; and lies chiefly in Verbs;</P>
<P>Metonymy lies most in Nouns, and this is the best Distinction I can make be∣tween them.</P>
<P>To exemplify the latter, We call a wise Man a <HI>Cato</HI> or a <HI>Solomon;</HI> a strong Man, a <HI>Hercules;</HI> a handsome Youth,
<PB N="270" REF="277"/>
an <HI>Adonis</HI>; a fine Woman, a <HI>Venus,</HI> or an <HI>Angel.</HI></P>
<P>The Instance is preserved too between rational Creatures, and Brutes. A rude Fellow is termed a Bear, a bold Fel∣low, a Lyon. "Go, tell that <HI>Fox,"</HI> &amp;c. says our <HI>Saviour,</HI> speaking of <HI>Herod,</HI> who was a cunning, supple, fawning Prince.</P>
<P>Again, between animate, and inani∣mate Beings; a fine Woman is a <HI>Jewel,</HI> a <HI>Rose,</HI> a <HI>Lilly.</HI> "Our God," says the Prophet, "is a consuming <HI>Fire."</HI> "I am the <HI>Vine,"</HI> declares our Saviour; and even names himself by Appellations of Qualities and Virtues, as well as by those of inanimate Beings—<HI>viz.</HI>—"I am the <HI>Way,"</HI> "the <HI>Truth,"</HI> "the <HI>Life."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278"/>Rivers are often named to imply the Country through which they pass, es∣pecially if they be the chief Rivers; as in a Line of <HI>Prior,</HI>
<Q>Her Warriors <HI>Anna</HI> sends from <HI>Tweed</HI> and <HI>Thames."</HI></Q></P>
<P>To use a Metonymy properly, we should start a new Thought; else it is to no Purpose; for why should we Call any one a <HI>Sir Francis Wronghead,</HI> un∣less we design to paint him under that Character? If <HI>Prior</HI> had meant <HI>Tweed</HI> and <HI>Thames</HI> in a proper Sense, there would have been no Meaning in the Expression at all.</P>
<P>The Figure Synecdoche is defined by a Part being placed for the Whole,
<PB N="272" REF="279"/>
as <HI>"My dear Heart."</HI> The Romans said, <HI>My dear Head! Honest Heart! Honest Breast!</HI> &amp;c. It is again seen, when the Containing is used for the Contained, as, <HI>Drink</HI> this Glass—Eat of this <HI>Dish</HI>—The whole <HI>Theatre</HI> burst into Tears—<HI>Greece</HI> was in Confusion—<HI>Africa</HI> was in Arms—The <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Danube</HI> made their Submissions to <HI>Caesar.</HI> Again, when Plurals are used for Singulars. As if a veteran Actor should say, Your <HI>Quins</HI> and your <HI>Cibbers</HI> were not comparable to the <HI>Bettertons</HI> and <HI>Barrys</HI> of the former Age.</P>
<P>This Figure is used both to extoll and depreciate, as you will easily discern. Great Judgment is required in the Ma∣nagement of this, and indeed of all.
<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
Nothing is more ridiculous than a Fi∣gure ill-placed.</P>
<P>There is a Passage in <HI>Claudian</HI> so ex∣cellent, that I must insert it. You will discover in it, the Metaphor, the Meto∣nymy, the Synecdoche, and the Hyper∣bole. It loses a great Deal of its Beauty, to be sure, when stripped of the Original Language; where it runs thus—</P>
<P>—Maduerunt <HI>Saxone</HI> fuso <HI>Orcades;</HI> incaluit <HI>Pictorum</HI> Sanguine <HI>Thule; Scotorum</HI> Cumulos flevit glacialis <HI>Ierne.</HI> This literally translated, is,
<Q>The <HI>Orkneys</HI> were drenched, the <HI>Saxon</HI> being overthrown; <HI>Thule</HI> grew warm with the Blood of the <HI>Picts,</HI> and the icy River <HI>Ierne</HI> mourned, in Tears, the Heaps of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that were slain.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="281"/>In my next, I shall go through the other Tropes, and shew you the Dif∣ference between what is called a Trope, and what a Figure. In the mean Time I leave it to you to find out where the Beauties of the above-cited Passage of <HI>Claudian</HI> lye.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not heard from you since <HI>Sunday</HI> last, so not having any Thing to an∣swer, I shall resume my Discourse, where I left off.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282"/>I shall not make any Mention of Irony, as you understand it sufficiently; nor need I say much of Hyperbole. It is only an Exaggeration of Things be∣yond the Reality, to make a deeper Im∣pression, or to give us a stronger Idea of what is meant to be conveyed to the Mind. We often run naturally into this, as indeed all Figures have their Source from our Passions and Sensibilities. How common is it to say, <HI>sweeter than Ho∣ney, whiter than Snow,</HI> when, in Truth, we mean no more than to say, <HI>very</HI> sweet, and <HI>very</HI> white.</P>
<P>An Hyperbole, like Irony, appears in the Shape of other Figures, sometimes in Similies, as, <HI>like the Snow for White∣ness;</HI> and there are Degrees in the Hy∣perbole,
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
as in the Simile; for, speaking of any antient Custom, we often say, <HI>as old as the Creation;</HI> and, when we would raise the Comparison higher, we say, <HI>older than the Creation.</HI> This Fi∣gure is noble, when judiciously used, but when improperly, it is harsh, un∣couth, and degenerates into a Catachre∣sis. There are so many noble Hyper¦boles in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and particularly in the Holy Writings, that it is needless to quote them.</P>
<P>A bold Metaphor becomes an Hyper∣bole, a strong extravagant Hyperbole becomes a Catachresis, and even in this there is some Beauty, when introduced with Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284"/>A Metaphor and Hyperbole are some∣times softened by a Comparison; and there is a Manner of expressing that Com∣parison, whereby not only the two first Figures, but even the third itself, is sof∣tened; and this is sometimes necessary to be contrived, to avoid Expressions which otherwise would be too strong.</P>
<P>All these shall be spoken of in their due Places, but I shall confine the Re∣mainder of this Letter solely to the Hy∣perbole.</P>
<P>In the first Place, an Hyperbole may be direct, as
<Q>The Giant's Head o'ertopp'd the Clouds;</Q>
and the Beauty of the Image presented, and Manner of the Description, frequently
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
set off this Figure, and totally conceal the Extravagance of the Fancy. <HI>Virgil</HI> gives us an Example of this in the ninth Book of his <HI>Aeneid,</HI> near the End. He tells us, <HI>Camilla</HI>
<Q><L>Outstripp'd the Winds in Speed upon the Plain,</L>
<L>Flew o'er the Fields, nor hurt the bearded Grain;</L>
<L>She swept the Seas, and as she skimm'd along,</L>
<L>Her flying Feet, unbath'd on Billows hung.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Passage is very beautiful, as <HI>Dry∣den</HI> has rendered it, but it is ten Times more so in the Original. <HI>Virgil</HI> says,</P>
<Q>She could have slown along the up∣permost Tops of a Field of Corn un∣cut, nor have hurt the tender Stalks in her Course; or she could have taken her Way through the Middle of the
<PB N="279" REF="286"/>
Sea, raised high with swelling Billows, nor so much as dipped the Soles of her swift Feet in them.</Q>
<P>This is a literal Translation; but no Description can reach the Beauties of the Original. Observe the pleasing Meta∣phors of <HI>flying</HI> instead of <HI>running fast</HI>; of <HI>hurting</HI> the Grain instead of <HI>treading it down</HI>; and the Word which I have ren∣dered <HI>dipp'd,</HI> is in the Latin <HI>tingeret,</HI> and conveys less than <HI>dipping</HI>; it implies no more than <HI>wetting</HI> or <HI>tincturing.</HI></P>
<P>An Hyperbole, in the next Place, may be indirect, as in a Comparison; thus,
<Q><L>It seems as if the <HI>Cyclades</HI> again</L>
<L>Were rooted up, and justled in the Main,</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="287"/>Or floating Mountains floating Mountains meet,</L>
<L>Such was the first Encounter of the Fleet.</L>
<BIBL>Aeneid, Book viii. near the End.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>When Hyperboles are very strong, the Subject or the Object at the instant, the Hurry, Heat, and Passion, ought not only to deserve, but even to require them.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Letter with one Example from the Holy Scriptures, where the Boldness of the Figure, in my Opinion, exceeds every thing of that Kind, which can any where be found; and surely the Occasion not only requires, but commands it. I think it is the Pro∣phet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> who, speaking of poor Mor∣tals in Comparison with the infinitely great and powerful God, says,</P>
<Q><PB N="281" REF="288"/>We are as Nothing, yea less than Nothing in thy Sight.</Q>
<P>Does not this strike us with a prodi∣gious Idea of the infinite Disproportion between <HI>God</HI> and us?</P>
<P>Though these Figures are easily un∣derstood yet it requires much Nicety and Attention to discover how, when, and where they are to be applied, what Degree of Force or Abatement is to be used in the Application, and how they should be dressed out for the Purpose.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 8, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU observe very truly, that if the Word <HI>as</HI> were taken out from the Passages of the Canticles, which you quoted, they would be still more beau∣tiful; and indeed it is not in the Origi∣nal. You see the <HI>as</HI> is in Italick Cha∣racters, which is constantly used when Words, that were not in the Original, are added to make the Sense more intel∣ligible, or to suit the warm Expressions of the Oriental Language to the Coldness of ours.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="290"/>The Simile, or Comparison, is a Figure easily comprehended, but a skilful Per∣son alone knows how and when to use it. One general and unerring Caution belongs to this, as well as to the other Tropes a-kin to it; namely, that Baseness or Meanness, Impropriety, Loathsomeness, Obscenity, and Prophaneness, are to be avoided. A low and unworthy Comparison should never interfere with a grand Sub∣ject. <HI>Homer</HI> is blamed for this in many In∣stances. I shall mention only one; to wit, where he compares <HI>Ajax</HI> to an <HI>Ass.</HI> I refer you to what <HI>Vida</HI> had advanced in his Disfavour, and <HI>Pope</HI> in his Defence. There is however great Propriety in the Comparison, that lies in the Action or Behaviour of the one and the other, on the Occasions that <HI>Homer</HI> mentions,
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
though not in the Person of <HI>Ajax</HI> and the <HI>Ass</HI>; but even the Introduction of them any how in a Likeness together, or pre∣senting the Idea of one with the other, seems to debase the Thing compared. <HI>Virgil,</HI> says <HI>Vida,</HI> would never have done this, and indeed we find him delicate in his Applications, and ever studiously cautious to avoid low and gross Com∣parisons.</P>
<P>There is a most disgustful Simile in one of <HI>Pope</HI>'s Epistles, about <HI>Westphalia</HI> Hogs; nothing but the Loathsomeness of the Vice he is decrying, and his De∣sign of making it detestable, can ex∣cuse it.</P>
<P>Prophane Comparisons shock People of Virtue, as much as People of Breed∣ing.
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
I will give you one Instance, which I have many Times heard with Pain. When any one has talked or acted in an unintelligible or unaccountable Manner, I have heard a Pretender at Wit exclaim, <Q>Oh! that's like the Peace of <HI>God,</HI> it passeth all Understanding;</Q> alluding prophanely to the Benediction at the End of the Communion-Service. Words and Phrases, which have been sanctified and consecrated in an especial Manner to re∣ligious Purposes, ought not idly to be played with and scoffed at. Some Per∣sons were so warm in the Revolution-Interest, that they called <HI>King William</HI> the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the Nation. It is true there was no actual Harm in this, but another Term might have been found, and with a better Grace, while we have so constant
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
and material an Idea devoted to the Word <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pope</HI> has been blamed by some Persons for calling <HI>Agamemnon, King of Kings</HI>; that Appellation having been so solemnly consecrated to <HI>God,</HI> in the <HI>Revelations,</HI> and elsewhere in the Holy Writings.</P>
<P>We are not to expect a Comparison should hit in every Particular; it is enough if the Thing, to which we allude, agree with the Thing compared in the prin∣cipal Point or Points, that we intend to illustrate.</P>
<P>A short Comparison is easily turned into a Metaphor; but where it runs into a Length of Circumstances, it is impos∣sible
<PB N="287" REF="296"/>
to do it. For Example, when <HI>Vir∣gil,</HI> in the twelfth Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> compares <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Turnus,</HI> in the Heat of the Battle, to two Torrents rushing down a Precipice, and laying every thing waste before them; and again, near the End of the Book, where he likens the same Heroes, <HI>Turnus</HI> flying, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> pursuing, to a Deer and a Hound, the Particulars are so many, and the Illus∣tration so extensively beautiful, that it would not be comprized within the Compass of a Metaphor.</P>
<P>Where the Metaphor would be too hard or obscure, then a Simile is neces∣sary; for Instance, it would have been uncouth in <HI>Homer</HI> to have called <HI>Hector a sudden Night,</HI> or <HI>a snowy Mountain</HI>; in
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
the one Place therefore he says, <Q>he came on the Greeks <HI>like</HI> sudden Night,</Q> which creates a strong Idea of Terror; and in the other, <HI>"like</HI> a snowy Mountain," from his Figure being so conspicuous, and his shining Arms.</P>
<P>Let me here digress a Moment, and raise your Admiration, perhaps, your In∣dignation. Some piddling Criticks, who, forsooth, would have a Comparison hit in every Particular, and look in the wrong Place for the Simile, have found Fault with the last I mentioned. " What," say they, <Q>does a snowy Mountain move?</Q> as if the Essence of the Simile consisted in the Motion. No, surely, the Beauty is only in the awful <HI>Appear∣ance</HI> of a Mountain covered with Snow,
<PB N="289" REF="298"/>
which <HI>Hector</HI> resembled when he moved along, towering in his Stature, and shining in his Arms.</P>
<P>As Comparisons need not be exact in every Particular, so sometimes a Poet of a sublime Genius will run his Descrip∣tion beyond the Comparison, when any singular Quality or Circumstance strikes upon his Fancy, though it has nothing to do with the Comparison itself, or the Matter that introduced it. Whether this is strictly allowable by the nice Rules of Criticism, I shall not determine; but surely it is very natural, and, in my Opinion, highly beautiful. The French call these Comparisons <HI>à longue Queue.</HI> Many of them are to be found in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Milton.</HI> They are not so frequent in
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
<HI>Virgil,</HI> though I shall instance you one from him, because it is but short, and has been the Subject of much Alterca∣tion among the learned. It is in the first Book of the Aeneid, and thus translated by <HI>Dryden,</HI>
<Q><L>So on Eurota's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Line 502. Quails ab Eurotae Ripis, &amp;c.</NOTE> Banks, or Cynthus' Height,</L>
<L>Diana seems and so she charms the Sight,</L>
<L>When in the Dance the graceful Goddess leads</L>
<L>The Choir of Nymphs, and over-tops their Heads;</L>
<L>Known by her Quiver and her lofty Mien,</L>
<L>She walks majestic, and she looks their Queen;</L>
<L>Latona sees her shine above the rest,</L>
<L>And feeds with secret Joy her silent Breast<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rowe,</HI> in his Tragedy of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> describing <HI>Penelope,</HI> has imitated this Passage very closely. <Q><L>Diana thus on Cynthus' shady Top,</L><L>Or by Eurota's Stream, leads to the Chace</L><L>Her Virgin-Train; a thousand lovely Nymphs</L><L>Of Form celestial all, troop by her Side:</L><L>Amidst a thousand Nymphs the Goddess stands con∣fess'd</L><L>In Beauty, Majesty and Port divine,</L><L>Supreme, and eminent.——<HI>Act I.</HI></L></Q></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="300"/><HI>Trapp</HI>'s Translation is more literal and nearer to the Words of <HI>Virgil,</HI> than <HI>Dry∣den's;</HI> well it might, you will say, in-as-much as he was not fettered to Rhyme.</P>
<Q><L>As on Eurota's Banks, or Cynthus' Top,</L>
<L>Diana leads her Train; a thousand Nymphs</L>
<L>Enclose her round, herself her Quiver bears</L>
<L>High on her Shoulder, and with stately Walk</L>
<L>O'ertops them all. A secret Pleasure slides</L>
<L>Along Latona's Breast.—Such Dido was.</L></Q>
<P>The Passage about <HI>Latona</HI> is, in the Ori∣ginal, literally thus,
<Q>Joys beat quite thro' Latona's silent Breast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Line 506. Latonae tacitum pertentant Gaudia Pectus.</NOTE>.</Q>
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
but there is no coming up to <HI>Virgil</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Now what I mean particularly to ob∣serve, is, the Circumstance of <HI>Latona</HI>'s Joy. This has nothing to do with the Comparison itself, and therefore some Critics wish it had been omitted. I am not one of their Number. I think it adds great Beauty to the Passage. Is any thing more lovely than such a Reflection as this? Would it not immediately and almost irresistibly strike a Poet of a noble Fancy? And is it not highly natural that a Parent should be in Transport at the Sight of a Child in such an <HI>Attitude,</HI> if I may so express myself? "The chief among ten thousand," as the Scrip∣ture
<PB N="293" REF="302"/>
terms it, and according to <HI>Otway,</HI> (if I do not err)
<Q>Among ten thousand eminently known?</Q>
Does not the Poet give us also a lovely Instance of Decorum, in describing the Parent modestly attempting to conceal her Transports of Joy, too delicate in her Feelings to exult openly? How ju∣dicious a Writer was <HI>Virgil!</HI></P>
<P>The Fancy and Judgment of a Poet is not more conspicuous in any Particu∣lar, than in a noble and apt Simile ele∣gantly expressed; for which Reason, I could wish you, my dear, to remark such carefully in all your reading, but more especially in these three great Poets, <HI>Ho∣mer, Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="303"/>I may possibly, some Time or other, shew you the vast Excellency of this Comparison (just quoted) in the Original, and how far it exceeds the Translation. I have little more to add at present, than to observe, Comparisons may be varied, heightened, or moderated and tempered, by way of adapting them better to your Purpose; nor need a Poet be confined to <HI>as, so,</HI> or <HI>like</HI>; for you perceive <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> sometimes says, <HI>have you,</HI> or <HI>have you not seen,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>You would think,</HI> &amp;c. When he wishes to soften a strong Comparison, his Phrase is, <HI>you would be tempted to be∣lieve</HI>; when to strengthen one, <HI>you would have sworn,</HI> and so on. I only give you Hints; you can enlarge on them in your own Mind; not that I mean to induce you to turn Poet; but to understand the
<PB N="295" REF="304"/>
preliminary Rules by which Things ought to be done, is the Method of tasting them, when done, and the most certain Means of distinguishing the Beau∣ties and Merits of one Author from another.</P>
<P>I fear I have sufficiently tired you, but it is worth your while to understand this Topic well. I shall be concise in my Definition of Allegory, Fable, and Catachresis, and then I have done with Tropes.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 18, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall now explain Allegory and Fa∣ble, and then give you Time to breathe awhile, for I fear I grow tire∣some to you; but it is your Good which I intend by my long Letters; and Pre∣cepts, delivered in this Mode of Dis∣course between Friends, often make a deeper Impression, than what are to be found in Books, although they may be better explained there. Besides, there are several Things only cursorily explained by <HI>Longinus,</HI> and even by <HI>Cicero</HI> and
<PB N="297" REF="306"/>
<HI>Quintilian,</HI> who have enlarged much more on these Heads. There are more∣over, in the Course of what I write, several little Observations of my own, which if they do you but little Service, will do you as little Harm.</P>
<P>Allegory is said to be a String of Me∣taphors; but I think this Description de∣fective; for unless that Series of Meta∣phors depends on some one particular Point, it is either a faulty Allegory, or, rather, no Allegory at all. To explain what I mean, I will quote a Passage from <HI>Shakespeare's Hamlet.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Whether 'tis nobler in the Mind to suffer</L>
<L>The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,</L>
<L>Or to take Arms against a Sea of Troubles,</L>
<L>And, by opposing, end them.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="298" REF="307"/>This has been much censured as a faulty Allegory, because the Writer flies from one Allusion to another, from <HI>Slings</HI> to <HI>taking up of Arms</HI>—against what?— <HI>a Sea</HI>—and then <HI>opposing a Sea,</HI> &amp;c. Now if <HI>Shakespeare</HI> meant this for an Allegory, it is doubtless very faulty; but I verily believe that was not his Meaning. I am of Opinion that he only took the first strong Metaphor which came into his Head, to express himself forcibly and pathetically, and then another, and ano∣ther, as the Subject rose upon them, but had no idea of making them connected with, or dependent on each other. I will not venture to affirm I am right, but I am certain that one of the most judicious and correct Authors that ever wrote Comedy, does the self-same Thing;
<PB N="299" REF="308"/>
I mean <HI>Terence.</HI> He makes one of his Characters say,</P>
<Q>I am <HI>walled</HI> about with so many and so great Difficulties, that I cannot <HI>swim</HI> out.</Q>
<P>This, you see, is liable to the very same Exception with the former, the Metaphor not being continued in the same Kind; but I believe neither Author had even the most distant Notion of an Al∣legory.</P>
<P>In the Passion of <HI>Biblis,</HI> in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Metamorphorsis,</HI> you have a perfect Alle∣gory drawn from <HI>Sea-faring.</HI>
<Q><L>I should have watch'd d whence the black Storm might rise,</L>

<L><PB N="300" REF="309"/>Now on the rolling Billows I am tost,</L>
<L>And with extended Sails on the blind Shelves am lost.</L></Q>
Here you see the Images are perfect and uniform. I will quote another from <HI>Prior's Henry</HI> and <HI>Emma,</HI> which is very beautiful;
<Q><L>Did I but purpose to embark with thee</L>
<L>On the smooth Surface of a Summer's Sea;</L>
<L>While gentle Zephyrs play with prosp'rous Gales,</L>
<L>And Fortune's Favour fills the swelling Sails,</L>
<L>But would forsake the Ship and make for Shore,</L>
<L>When the Winds whistle, and the Tempests roar?</L></Q></P>
<P>Here also you find the Allegory finely pursued throughout; yet not so scru∣pulously, as not to depart a little from it in the fourth Line,
<Q><PB N="301" REF="310"/>And Fortune's <HI>Favour</HI> fills, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>May I here be permitted to say that one of <HI>Gay</HI>'s Songs, in his <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> contains as perfect an Allegory as can any where be found? The most minute Scrutiny can scarce mark a Deficiency.</P><Q><L>I'm like a <HI>Skiff</HI> on the <HI>Ocean tost,</HI></L><L>Now <HI>high,</HI> now <HI>low,</HI> with each <HI>Billow</HI> borne,</L><L>With her <HI>Rudder</HI> broke, and her <HI>Anchor</HI> lost,</L><L>Deserted and all forlorn.</L></Q><P>But the poetical Beauties of the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> are too generally overlooked, either through an Attention to the Musical Part, or that the Piece it∣self is considered as merely ludicrous, rather than a Composition of exquisite Satire, Poetry, Wit, and Humour.</P></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>From Allegory there is an easy Tran∣sition to little proverbial Sayings, and to Fables, which are but Allegories worked up into a Story. Our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Parables are of this Kind, exactly in Character, and obvious to every Understanding.
<PB N="302" REF="311"/>
<HI>Aesop,</HI> it is true, takes the Liberty to make Birds and Beasts speak, but, bar∣ring that, he always adheres to Charac∣ter. There ought to be a Moral couched in all Fables, or to no Purpose are they spoke or written.</P>
<P>Comparisons, proverbial Speeches, Pa∣rables and Fables, may be easily convert∣ed, the one into the other.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Moral is expressed, sometimes understood. By some Writers it is set in Front, as by <HI>Fontaine</HI>; by some, at the End, as by <HI>Aesop</HI>; and oc∣casionally it is placed in the Middle of the Work.</P>
<P>Those moral Sentences which we find so frequently interspersed in <HI>Homer, Vir∣gil,
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
Milton,</HI> &amp;c. before, in the Middle, or at the Close of some interesting Nar∣ration, are entirely in the Nature of Mo∣rals to a Fable.</P>
<P>I shall throw a little Illustration on these Points, particularly relative to pro∣verbial Sentences and Phrases, and then release my dear Scholar.</P>
<P>We have a Proverb in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<Q>Cocks are free of Horse-Corn;</Q>
meaning to imply that People are liberal or profuse of what belongs to another.</P>
<P>Again, we have,
<Q>Use a Cat to the Churn, and she will call i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Custom;</Q>
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
signifying, if you accustom your Servants, or other Folks, to make frequent Use of what is yours, they will think, at last, that they have acquired a Right to it.</P>
<P>How easily now may these be changed into a Comparison! for Instance, <Q>As a Cat that has been allowed,</Q> &amp;c.—<Q>As a Cock, that sits in a Manger,</Q> &amp;c. —or into a Fable, as, <Q>A Widow had a favourite Cat, whom she indulged</Q> and so on. These simple Examples clearly shew how closely the Figures are allied.</P>
<P>A Fable or Story may be either true or false, it matters not which, so that a Moral accompanies it, and flows natu∣rally from it.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="314"/>Here follows a Quotation from Spen∣ser, where a Fable, Comparison, and Moral, are finely wrought up together.</P>
<Q><L>As when a weary Traveller, that strays</L>
<L>By muddy Shore of broad sev'n-mouthed Nile,</L>
<L>Unweeting of the per'lous wand'ring Ways,</L>
<L>Doth meet a cruel, crafty Crocodile,</L>
<L>Which, in false Grief hiding his harmful Guile,</L>
<L>Doth weep full sore, and sheddeth tender Tears,</L>
<L>The foolish Man, that pities, all this while,</L>
<L>His mournful Plight, is swallow'd anawares,</L>
<L>Forgetful of his own, who minds another's Cares.</L></Q>
<P>In the foregoing Part of this Letter, I observed that <HI>Aesop,</HI> though he makes his feigned Persons, that is, his Birds and Beasts, converse and reason, yet he always preserves Character. One Mi∣nute's Patience more, while I illustrate this. His first Fable affords me the Means.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="315"/><Q>A Dog, with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth, looking into a Pool of Water, imagines he there sees another Dog, with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth; he snatches at that, and thereby loses his own.</Q></P>
<P>This is all very natural to a Dog, and a plain Moral is to be deduced; namely; that we give up Certainty for Hope, when we greedily grasp at having too much.</P>
<P>The Reverse of this Rule of preserving Character is <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Fable of the <HI>Hind</HI> and <HI>Panther.</HI> He has wholly departed from it. His Hind and Panther set forth at first in Kind, I allow; but in the Sequel, he makes them reason and
<PB N="307" REF="316"/>
dispute about Fathers and Councils, the Church, and the <HI>Pope,</HI> School-Divinity, Infallibility, and the Lord knows what. He then introduces a whole Flock of Birds, and characterizes them all as Men. The <HI>Buzzard</HI> was the famous Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> who was Bishop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dryden</HI> has been justly censured for this Inconsistency; for say the Critics, in Support of their Accusation, <Q>Sup∣pose a Colonel of Horse had thrown up his Regiment in foolish Hope of getting a higher Command, and was disappointed,</Q> Aesop's Fable might aptly be applied to him; but it would be absurd to say, <Q>The Dog seeing another Dog in the Water, with a Piece of Meat in his Mouth, dropped
<PB N="308" REF="317"/>
the Piece in his own Mouth, and snatched at the other, and so lost his <HI>Regiment of Horse.</HI></Q> This were to confound the Allusion with the Story alluded to, the Moral with the Fable.</P>
<P>I question whether I need trouble you with the Catachresis or no; however I will be brief.</P>
<P>Catachresis is the Abuse or over-strain∣ing a Figure. One Species of it is, when, through the Want of proper, we use im∣proper Terms; for Example, a <HI>Glass-Inkhorn,</HI> or a <HI>Silver Smoothing-Iron.</HI> Par∣ricide is properly the Murderer of one's Father, but in Default of better Powers of Expression, we apply the Name to one who has murdered, either his Mo∣ther,
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
Brother or Sister. <HI>Longinus</HI> cen∣sures some Writer for calling a Hillock a <HI>Wart. Quintilian</HI> has given many Instances of this, and even from <HI>Virgil</HI>; some of them very beautiful; but when the Image is beautiful, I think it can not with Propriety be called a Catachresis. <HI>Blackwell</HI> pronounces the following Pas∣sage from <HI>Milton</HI> to be such;
<Q><L>Down thither prone in Flight</L>
<L>He speeds, and thro' the vast aetherial Sky</L>
<L>Sails between Worlds and Worlds.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is when he describes the De∣scent from Heaven of the Arch-Angel, <HI>Raphael.</HI> I am not of his Opinion; the Idea is supremely sublime, but not overstrained.</P>
<P><HI>Statius,</HI> describing a general Silence and Quiet, says,
<Q><PB N="310" REF="319"/>
<L>The weary Mountains nodded their Heads;</L>
<L>And the Seas rested or slept, leaning against the Shore.</L></Q></P>
<P>I forgot to mention the 29th Ode of <HI>Horace,</HI> in his 3d Book; it is finely imitated by <HI>Dryden</HI>; there he begins with Fortune as a Goddess, then allego∣rizes her into a Bird, and lastly runs into another long Allegory of sailing in a Storm.</P>
<P>The next Time I write, I shall shew the Difference between Tropes and Fi∣gures, and then, in Compassion to your wondrous Patience, quit the Subject.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONE Thing I advanced was, that in <HI>Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. the Moral is often placed in the Middle of the Story. Such Insertions are called Sentences, or short moral Reflections.</P>
<P>When <HI>Turnus</HI> kills <HI>Pallas,</HI> in the tenth Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and is exulting in the Victory he has obtained, the Poet, in the very Heart of his Story, breaks forth into this Reflection.</P>
<Q><L>Dark to Futurity, and blind to Fate,</L>
<L>Are mortal Minds, indocile to observe</L>
<L>Due Measure, when elated with Success."</L>
<BIBL>Dr. Trapp.</BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="312" REF="321"/>In the Beginning of the twelfth Book of the <HI>Iliad, Homer</HI> tells us in one Line, "The Grecian Wall was built without Sacrifices to the Gods;" in the next Line, he says, "Without the good Will of the Gods;" and immediately thereon adds,
<Q><L>Without the Gods how short a Period stands,</L>
<L>The proudest Monument of mortal Hands!</L></Q>
The Meaning here is exactly the same with that In Psalm cxxvii. I.</P>
<Q>Except the Lord build the House, they but labour in vain who build it.</Q>
<P>Where, by the Way, you may remark the strong and figurative Turn of the Eastern Language; we should, probably, phrase it, "Without <HI>God's Assistance,"</HI> but they more emphatically call it <HI>"God's own Doing."</HI></P>
<P>There
<PB N="313" REF="322"/>is a short, but noble, Reflection in the Story of <HI>Calisto</HI> in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Metamorphoses. <HI>Calisto,</HI> before she was dishonoured by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> was always at the Side of <HI>Diana,</HI> but, after that disgraceful Event, she de∣clined the Freedom, and lagged behind her; whereon the Poet exclaims,
<Q><L>How in the Look does conscious Guilt appear?</L>
<L>Slowly she mov'd, and loiter'd in the Rear,</L>
<L>Nor lightly tripp'd, nor by the Goddess ran,</L>
<L>As once she us'd, the Foremost of the Train;</L>
<L>Her Looks were flush'd, &amp;c.</L>
<BIBL>Addison.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Having illustrated this Point, as far I think necessary, I am tempted, from the foregoing Quotation, to make a short Digression. A most excellent Lesson, my dear Nanoy, may fairly be deduced from the Story of <HI>Calisto</HI>; no doubt, the Author meant it.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="323"/>Thus then it stands. An artful, prac∣ticed, general Lover (such was <HI>Jove</HI>'s Character) can assume any, and every Appearance to effect his Purpose; the more contradictory to what he really is, the better his Fraud is concealed. <HI>Jove</HI> assumes the Appearance even of <HI>Diana,</HI> by which the Poet means, that the Lover may wear the Mask of the most delicate Chastity, till he finds an Opportunity to throw it off, and resume the <HI>Jove.</HI> How this is to be guarded against, is also nicely insinuated by <HI>Ovid.</HI> He seems to say, <Q>Never suffer yourself to listen to the specious Discourses of that Lover, who wishes to separate you from the Virgin Throng, in whose Company you are safe, or from your Protectress, the real <HI>Diana,</HI> and lead you to private
<PB N="315" REF="324"/>
Walks and secret Groves,</Q> as the Author phrases it. The poor <HI>Calisto,</HI> you see, meant no Ill, but she had thrown herself <HI>out of Protection.</HI> The more plausible and spe∣cious a Lover appears, the more dan∣gerous he really is. Every virtuous Wo∣man shudders at a professed Libertine; but you remember the Moral to the <HI>Cha∣peron rouge,</HI> my dear Nancy, which you translated at seven Years old,
<Q><L>Helas! qui ne sçait que ces Loups doucere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x</L>
<L>De tous les Loups sont les plus dangereux!</L></Q>
and there is really but one Test to be made of this <HI>human Wolf</HI>; namely, will he suffer his Address to be made known to your tried and natural Friends, your Parents, or Guardians? If he declines this, and wishes it to be kept se∣cret,
<PB N="316" REF="325"/>
then take Heed, <Q>The Wolf, the Wolf's at Hand.</Q></P>
<P>I now proceed to give you, as far as I am able, the Difference between Tropes and Figures.</P>
<P>In the first Place, you are to know that both are occasionally called Figures; and <HI>Quintilian</HI> himself confesses, that the Distinction is very often hard to be ascer∣tained; for some figurative Expressions may belong either to Synecdoche, which is a Trope, or Polyptote, Which is a Figure. The best Distinction then, that I can draw, is this; Trope is a Turn∣ing of the proper Sense of the Word into a borrowed, or improper Sense. For Example, <HI>I swell with Rage, or Pride.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="326"/>A <HI>Figure</HI> is an extraordinary Expres∣sion; it consists in the Point, Arrange∣ment, Repetition, or Disposition of Words in a Manner not common.</P>
<P><HI>Trope</HI> comes from a Greek Word, which signifies a Turning or Changing, and is only applied where the <HI>Sense</HI> is turned. When the Turn is in the <HI>Words,</HI> we call it <HI>Figure</HI>; though the Word <HI>Trope</HI> would be as proper to imply <HI>Figure,</HI> but Custom has made it thus; and that is sufficient for our Purpose.</P>
<P>The Tropes are principally what we have been discoursing about, and are chiefly Metaphor, Metonymy, Synec∣doche, Irony, Hyperbole, Allegory, Comparison, Sentences or short Morals,
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
Fable or Parable, and Catachresis. These are most necessary to be studied.</P>

<P>I Have the Pleasure of yours of the 28th, and heartily congratulate you on your Mama being somewhat better. Do not remit your Attention to her, to oblige me. Till she is further advanced in her Recovery, I desire only a Line to tell me how you both go on, and whether your young Friend has been successful in her Application. The Want of a Situa∣tion and Protection, at such an early Time of Life, naturally claims our Com∣passion and Assistance; but I am still

<P>I Received yours, and thank you for it. I do not expect or desire more than such a short Intelligence, while your Mama continues so ill. You are right not to neglect her in any Point; you owe her more than ever you can repay.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="333"/>I have been reviewing some of your Letters to-day, and am thence induced to advance a Trifle on this Kind of Cor∣respondence, and the Style necessary for it. Persevere, my dear, in that simple Manner of writing, which you seem to inherit from Nature. Epistolary Corre∣spondence should be as easy as Conver∣sation. Do not suffer an Intimacy with sublime Authors to tempt you out of this plain, humble Manner of expressing yourself. You are an Exception to a very general Rule. It is too much the Custom of young Folks, when once they have dipped into Books, to endeavour at high-flown Language in their Writing. Nothing is so absurd; allowing they ex∣press themselves ever so properly, the Expressions are misplaced. They have

no Business in a Letter, where every thing should be plain, easy, and concise.</P>
<P>Figure, above all Things, should be avoided in these familiar Discourses. I have known a Novice in Reading and Writing missed by a Simile, so as not to know the Point he first advanced, and another so envelope himself in a Meta∣phor, as not to be able to find the Way out.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since my last, I have read the chief of <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Plays; some of them are indeed but <HI>petites Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>This Week I design to examine <HI>Le Medecin malgré lui, Amphitryon, Le Mi∣santrope,</HI> and <HI>L'Avare.</HI> I propose to
<PB N="330" REF="339"/>
read the two last with great Care, as they are reputed two of his finest Plays. <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes</HI> is my great Favourite, and, for a petite Piece, <HI>Les precieuse Ri∣dicules.</HI> I like the <HI>Femmes Sçavantes</HI> migh∣tily.</P>
<P><HI>Le Malade Imaginaire,</HI> was <HI>Moliere</HI>'s last Play, and thought by some Critics to be the best he ever wrote. I think, at least, there is more Instruction and Diversion mingled together in this, than in many of his Pieces. The <HI>Misantrope,</HI> perhaps, is the most masterly, but it does not create so much Mirth as some others, and the Characters and Sentiments re∣quire great Attention.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="340"/>I will now set down the Plays which I have read, and which you are not ac∣quainted with. <HI>George Dandin, Tartuffe, Monsieur Pourceaugnac, Le Bourgeois Gen∣tilhomme, Les Fourberies de Scapin, Les Femmes Sçavanies, Le Malade Imaginaire.</HI> You will find the first, third, fourth, and fifth, very entertaining, <HI>fort enjouées,</HI> as the French say. The second, sixth, and seventh, are very instructing, and will likewise give you great Pleasure, espe∣cially the two last.</P>
<P><HI>Moliere</HI>'s four great Plays, in my Opi∣nion, are <HI>Le Misantrope, L'Avare, Le Malade Imaginaire,</HI> and <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes.</HI> I think the Character of <HI>Agnes,</HI> in <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes,</HI> and that of <HI>Alceste,</HI> in the <HI>Misantrope,</HI> the two finest he ever drew.
<PB N="332" REF="341"/>
The next in Degree is <HI>Arnolphe</HI> in <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes.</HI> The two Brothers, <HI>Ariste</HI> and <HI>Sganarelle,</HI> in <HI>L'Ecole des Maris, Madame Pernelle</HI> in <HI>Tartuffe,</HI> the two <HI>precieuses Ridicules, Sosie</HI> in <HI>Amphitryon, Harpagon</HI> and the <HI>Commissaire</HI> in <HI>L'Avare,</HI> are all finely drawn; not but there are many others well executed, but these strike me most, and must have cost him great Pains to paint, as their Excellence con∣sists not only in their being truly just and natural, but they are withal nicely and highly finished.</P>
<P>Some of his Pieces are of the Opera-Kind, especially <HI>L'Isle D'Amour,</HI> and <HI>Princesse d'Elide, Psyche,</HI> and <HI>Melicerte,</HI> which last is a pastoral heroic Comedy.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="342"/>These which you have read are the best, excepting only <HI>Le Malade Imaginaire.</HI> The <HI>Bourgeois Gentilhomme,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,</HI> will divert you much; <HI>George Dandin, Les Fourberies de Scapin,</HI> and <HI>La Contesse D'Escarbagnas,</HI> will like∣wise give you some Pleasure. All which I have now gone through I did read for∣merly, except the <HI>Contesse D'Escarbagnas.</HI> She is a silly, vain, affected Woman of Quality, who had been once in her Life at <HI>Paris,</HI> for about two Months, which runs mightily in her Head. She has some Resemblance of Lady <HI>Plyant,</HI> but, in my Opinion, is not so well drawn.</P>

<P>There is a Poem of <HI>Moliere</HI> in Com∣mendation of <HI>Mignard</HI>'s Painting in a
<PB N="335" REF="344"/>
Church at <HI>Paris.</HI> It is called <HI>La Gloire du Dome du Val de Grace,</HI> but this I have not yet read.</P>
<P>This Week I have gone through <HI>L'Etourdi, Don Juan, Le Depit amoureux, Les Amans Magnifiques,</HI> and <HI>L'Ombre de Moliere. L'Etourdi</HI> is the first Play he wrote. The chief Entertainment of this Piece consists in the Address and Contri∣vance of the Servant being perpetually overturned by the Blunders of his Master. Though the latter promises again and again not to meddle in the Schemes of the former, yet his Vanity and Self-Suf∣ficiency still prompt him to interfere anew, and ruin the whole. We see, in the Ser∣vant, that a Pride to have his Plots suc∣ceed induces him to be constant to his
<PB N="336" REF="345"/>
Master, rather than his Love and Fidelity; and, at the last, the Scheme succeeds more by good Luck, than any other Cir∣cumstance. All this is very judiciously hit off by the Author; but to make the Servant talk to his Master in the most sarcastical Strain, and ever and anon call him Beast and Fool, is beyond all Bounds of Propriety and Decorum.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> is dreadfully destroyed by Thunder and Lightning, and the Earth swallows him, which Fate is, in a Man∣ner, foretold to him by an Apparition. Nothing can end more tragically, yet <HI>Moliere</HI> calls it a Comedy. <HI>Juan</HI>'s Cha∣racter is horridly fine, and consistent throughout; <HI>bien soutenû,</HI> as the French express it. He is brave, fierce, exces∣sively
<PB N="337" REF="346"/>
passionate, not devoid of Sense or Wit, but a most abandoned Wretch. The Moral of the Play is good, and there are some very diverting Scenes; particularly one with a Merchant, who comes to dun <HI>Juan</HI> for Money; whence Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> I surmise, took the Hint of the Scene, to the same Effect, between <HI>Valentine</HI> and <HI>Trapland.</HI></P>
<P>The Sentiments and Dialogue of the <HI>Depit amoureux</HI> are good; the Character of Women given by <HI>Gros-renè</HI> to his Master, is very entertaining; and though there is no Excess of Wit or Humour in the Piece, yet it is the best-conducted Plot in all <HI>Moliere.</HI> The Manner whereby he winds all his Personages out of their Difficulties engages the Attention won∣derfully,
<PB N="338" REF="347"/>
and conveys a Pleasure rather from the Result of the whole, than from Particulars. I would therefore, my Dear, have you read it with great At∣tention.</P>
<P>There is no great Matter in the <HI>Amans Magnifiques,</HI> yet it is entertaining; but the Interlude after the second Act, a sort of little pastoral Drama, is, I think, one of the finest Things I ever saw, in that Way. It is simple, natural, and perfectly suited to the pastoral Character. The Song of <HI>Tircis,</HI> which is called the first Scene, and that of <HI>Caliste,</HI> which is the third, are tender and natural beyond Ex∣pression, and the rest entirely accord with them.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="348"/><HI>Le Malade Imaginaire</HI> is admirably fine; but herein <HI>Moliere</HI> has been much blamed for attacking Physic as an Art. In his other Plays, say they, he attacks Quackery, and the Abuse of that Art; but here he attacks Physic itself, and re∣presents the very Science as an Imposi∣tion on Mankind. I am afraid there is something of this too true, in the Conversation between the Miser and his Brother.</P>
<P><HI>L'Ombre du Moliere</HI> is a <HI>petite Piece.</HI> It was written by one <HI>Brecourt,</HI> who was an Actor under <HI>Moliere.</HI> The Plan is this—The Ghosts of many of those Per∣sonages, whom <HI>Moliere</HI> had turned into Ridicule, come to <HI>Pluto,</HI> in the other World, to complain of him. The whole
<PB N="340" REF="349"/>
is pretty well executed, in particular the Character of the <HI>Doctor</HI>; but I cannot, by any Means, perceive a Reason for introducing the Ghost of <HI>Nicolle</HI> in the <HI>Bourgeois Gentilhomme.</HI></P>

<P>I Have now read <HI>Moliere's Plaisirs de L'Isle Enchantée,</HI> with the <HI>Princesse d'Elide,</HI> which is a Part of it. It costs a World of Pains to read it through, and it is of that Species, which gives more
<PB N="341" REF="350"/>
Pleasure by being considered all together, than in its particular Parts. There is something remarkably fine and natural in the Character and Behaviour of the <HI>Prince d'Hague,</HI> and the <HI>Princesse d'Elide,</HI> and proves the Author well understood Hu∣mankind. But I shall not enter into it minutely, that I may not forestall your Pleasure. It will cost you some Pains in reading, but is worth them all, only to consider those two Characters tho∣roughly. They are not only perfectly well drawn, but withal very instructive. I think the Character of <HI>Moron</HI> rather unnatural. It is both in Verse and Prose, and there is something in each, not to be found in the other, which de∣serves well to be read; it will therefore cost you a double Application. If you
<PB N="342" REF="351"/>
will mark down Phrases and Words, which are new to you, you will find the Advantage of it. When you have ex∣amined these very carefully, we will dis∣course on the particular Beauties.</P>
<P>Since I left <HI>Moliere,</HI> I have applied myself again to <HI>Horace.</HI> I have gone through all his Satires, Epistles, Art of Poetry, the two first Books of his Odes, and half of the third. It is much to be lamented, that this inimitable Author is not well translated. I do not know where there are more excellent Instructions for the Conduct of human Life. At present, I shall only recommend to your Perusal the second and eighteenth Epistles in the first Book, and the tenth Satire, in the second Book. Howbeit in any Trans∣lation,
<PB N="343" REF="352"/>
they must fall infinitely short of the poetical Beauty of the Original, yet the good Sense contained in them will shine through any Disguise.</P>

<P>YOU desire my Opinion of <HI>Moliere.</HI> One general Complaint is, that he mixes too much Farce with his Plays. I own, I think so too. <HI>Boileau</HI> has no∣ticed <HI>Geronte</HI> in the Sack in the <HI>Four∣beries of Scapin.</HI> The <HI>Bourgeois Gentil∣homme</HI> ends in a mere Farce and a most extravagant one too. The Dispute be∣tween
<PB N="344" REF="353"/>
the two Servants about letting in their Master, is quite a Farce; so is <HI>Toinette</HI>'s acting the Part of the <HI>Doctor</HI> in the <HI>Malade Imaginaire</HI>; nor can I per∣ceive why it is introduced. There are many more Instances of this Kind in his Plays. Those who defend him say he was compelled to this by the Humour of the Time; that he had to please the Town, as well as the <HI>Sçavants,</HI> the Peo∣ple of Taste and the Court; and that the Success of his Pieces depended on the first Set of Hearers, as well as the others. In Truth, I think this no bad Defence, and, it must be allowed, that these Scenes would, in a Farce, be very en∣tertaining.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="354"/>Some say his Language is not perfectly pure. I will not pretend to decide in that, but the different Characters he brings in ought to be considered; for Example, in the <HI>Bourgeois Gentilhomme,</HI> when he introduces a <HI>Gasconne,</HI> and a <HI>Pi∣carde,</HI> should he not make them speak the <HI>Patois</HI> of their respective Countries? Moreover as many of his Plays are not only in Verse, but in Rhyme, this might be a Constraint, and oblige him often to use uncouth and obsolete Words.</P>
<P>The greatest Objection to <HI>Moliere</HI> is still behind; and that is, that there is sometimes a sort of Deficiency, in the <HI>Denouement</HI> of his Plot. This Objection was made by the great <HI>Monsieur Le Clerc;</HI>
<PB N="346" REF="355"/>
and I think this is not only true respect∣ing the unravelling of the Story, but, in several of his Plays, I think his Plot is not conducted with all the Address in the World, and that it is even too loosely put together. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Plots are admirably conducted, and if they have any Fault, it is, that they are so closely woven, that, unless we consider them very narrowly, the Contexture will escape us; but then they add great Beauty and Grace to the Piece, when unfolded and brought in View. This is par∣ticularly evinced in his <HI>Way of the World,</HI> where every thing is judiciously linked to∣gether, and each Incident arises naturally out of the other. In my next, I shall send my Thoughts on <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Beauties, which greatly exceed his Faults.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favoured with yours of the 18th instant, and shall answer the latter Part of it first.</P>
<P>Those People, whose Description you have noted, are the antient <HI>Belgians,</HI> and their Neighbourhood, which contains
<PB N="348" REF="357"/>
<HI>Holland, Flanders,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> the Archbishoprick of <HI>Triers, Liege, Juliers, Cleve,</HI> and <HI>Berg.</HI> You will understand such Descriptions better, if you will apply to a Map of <HI>Europe.</HI> Beside that it is useful to point out the Situation of Places, it will make your reading more pleasant. By these Means you will see how our Armies abroad lie, what Way they march, what Towns are besieged and taken. When we hear News, or read History, and have no Knowledge of the Situation of Towns, Countries, Rivers, Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we receive little Pleasure, and less Instruction, from what we hear and read.</P>
<P>It is reported that Elephants never lie down to sleep, on Account of the Stiffness
<PB N="349" REF="358"/>
of their Joints, which makes them un∣able to rise; therefore, when they are inclined to sleep, they lean against a Tree. The Indians, in order to catch them, saw the Tree half asunder, or more, which giving Way, the Beast falls. This, perhaps, is fabulous, for they have much better Methods to catch them; but the Story may serve well enough to build a Simile upon.</P>
<P>I think the Simile of Night exceeding fine, but defective; you should consider, it is not Night only, but Silence also that he is describing. <HI>Virgil</HI> takes in the Winds and Waves, the silent March of the Stars;
<Q><L>The Winds no longer whisper thro' the Woods,</L>
<L>Nor murm'ring Tides disturb the gentle Floods,</L>
<L><PB N="350" REF="359"/>The Stars in silent Order march'd around,</L>
<L>And Peace, with downy Wings, was brooding on the Ground.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is Part of the Description only, and infinitely short of the Original; it is in the fourth Book of the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> The last of these Lines contains, in the Ori∣ginal, but four Words, and literally translated, signifies, "When every Field held its Tongue." What <HI>Dryden</HI> calls
<Q>To haunt the Woods, or swim the weedy Pool,</Q>
is in <HI>Virgil,</HI> <Q>which inhabit the Coun∣try, that is rough with Shrubs and Bushes, and the wide-extended liquid Lakes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="360"/><HI>Virgil</HI> gives us none but beautiful Ideas. Why does <HI>Tasso</HI> present us with <HI>the Serpent's Hiss, and Dragon's Cry?</HI> I own they are natural, but they are also frightful, and, as <HI>Shakespeare</HI> says, they <HI>make Night hideous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> makes every thing to be at Rest, but <HI>Dido.</HI> It was for her Sake the Description was brought in; and the Excess of her Passion and Distress is vastly heightened by the beautiful Pic∣ture of every thing being at Rest, ex∣cept herself.</P>
<P><HI>Tasso</HI> makes all at Rest, but the Music of the Spheres. This is injudicious. What has the Music of the Spheres to do here? It is an old, idle Fancy; be∣sides,
<PB N="352" REF="361"/>
as <HI>Hudibras</HI> says, We hear it not; why then was it excepted? or how can a Noise, which is not heard, lull the World to Rest? I give you this as a Specimen of the superior Judgment of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and the Beauty that arises therefrom; notwithstanding I allow, that <HI>Tasso</HI>'s Description, with these Abate∣ments, has its Merit. If you would read <HI>Bossu</HI> carefully, especially his Con∣trast of <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Statius,</HI> you would see how natural and judicious the former is, and how much the latter falls short of him.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU ask my Advice in many Points, wherein I think you are able per∣fectly to direct yourself. Your Conduct, in general, is very satisfactory to me, and I believe, to your Mama; however, to the best of my Ability, I will comply with your Request, and it will be no Burthen to have two or three spare Rules by you.</P>
<P>In one Part of your Letter, you desire a Plan to live by. I never could live
<PB N="354" REF="363"/>
by a Plan myself, consequently am unfit to lay down one to you; and I love my own Liberty too well, to abridge that of other People.</P>
<P>I believe one very general Error in young Folks is a too great Readiness to make Acquaintance. This ought to be most warily guarded against. Much of our Happiness, Reputation, end Welfare, depends upon the Choice of Intimates.</P>
<P>A proper Division of Time is another very material Point. I am as much a Friend to innocent Recreations, as to Bu∣siness. The only Nicety is to steer be∣tween too close an Application to the latter, and an Excess in the former. Your little Neighbour, Miss D—, will
<PB N="355" REF="364"/>
live to repent her ill Custom of sitting up late at Night, and loitering a-bed in the Morning. Few Things are more pre∣judicial to Business, Reputation and Health. A thousand Inconveniencies are entailed, which are not dreamed of at first. She might break herself of it easily now, and may find it very hard some Years hence. I once loved it as well as she does, yet I got over it, and now rise every Day between six and seven.</P>
<P>A proper Division of Time preserves us from being hurried at one Time, and made languid and weary at another; it gives a <HI>Gout</HI> to Diversion, and makes Bu∣siness sit light and easy.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="365"/>A proper Choice of Companions, at your early Time of Life chiefly, is of the utmost Consequence. There is great Truth in the old Proverb, <Q>A Man is esteemed according to the Company he keeps;</Q> for such as our Company is, such, in great Measure, shall we our∣selves be. We fall insensibly, and al∣most unavoidably, into the Manners, Air, Sentiments, and Turn of those Persons, with whom we converse much, especially in our early Years, so that young People cannot be too much on their Guard in this Particular. Our Reputation is also affected by the Company we keep. Is there any thing oftner heard than this, and when nothing else perhaps can be alledged, <Q>Ay, such a young Man, or such a Girl, is very good, but too
<PB N="357" REF="366"/>
much in such or such-a-one's Com∣pany?</Q> Our Associates therefore should be as good and as wise as may be found, at least, in our own Opi∣nion, and the higher Credit and Re∣putation they are in, the better still for us.</P>
<P>I am far from dictating or prescribing rigidly. I would not have a Person tied down to a formal Method, to move like a Puppet upon Wires. I am very sensible that Diversion and Com∣pany are almost as necessary as Meat, Drink, or Sleep; but I dare say you will agree with me that there are cer∣tain Measures, Proportions, and Distri∣butions, in all Sorts of Recreation, as
<PB N="358" REF="367"/>
well as Business, which we ought seldom to exceed.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I begin to have but few Franks, I must put two or three Letters into one.</P>
<P>I am ready to answer your Questions about dividing your Time aright, and
<PB N="359" REF="368"/>
to give you the best Directions I can on that Point. It is of the greatest Moment to Happiness. Your desiring Information on this Head pleases me much, though, as I said before, I think you do not stand in need of it; however, I will express myself as if you did, that I may give my Meaning more clear, and to the Purpose.</P>
<P>I cannot enter minutely into Particu∣lars; those must occur to yourself, as Circumstances, Times, and Occasions fall out; I shall only observe some general Things, and explain and illustrate them to you in the best Manner I can.</P>
<P>First then, in order to employ Time well, to lay it out to Purpose, and in
<PB N="360" REF="369"/>
due Proportions, it must be supposed that you have Time in your Possession. The Question then is, how to purchase a sufficient Quantum, or Measure of Time. This is not so hard for you, now, at least, as for many People, whose Time belongs to others, not to them∣selves; who perhaps are Masters or Mis∣tresses of Families, who have Ware-Houses, or Shops to look after, or some other Charge, that requires great Por∣tions of their Time. Be that as it may, a certain Stock of Time is necessary for Business, for Improvement, and for all the necessary Functions of Life; Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, and even Recreation and Diversion; for these are necessary too; but always in Order to qualify us
<PB N="361" REF="370"/>
for some better and more important Purposes; and are to be used as Means to attain some End we aim at, and not as the Things themselves.</P>
<P>How then are we to purchase this <HI>Stock of Time?</HI> Without this by us, our Time, however judiciously distri∣buted, will not answer. For Example, if I have but a Crown to go to Market with, and must necessarily have Things to the Value of a Guinea, let me lay out my Money ever so prudently, it will not serve my Purpose. Herein is evinced the vast Necessity of purchasing as great a Fund of Time, as we can.</P>
<P>To this Purpose I know no one parti∣cular Thing so conducive, as rising early.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="371"/>We then have the whole Day before us, can dress in Time, breakfast in Time, go abroad or stay at Home, as Affairs demand; if the former, we are sure of meeting People at the ordinary Hours of Meals, Business, or Diversion; beside, the Mind is more fresh, active, and strong to apply to Study, or any other Employment that requires us.</P>
<P><Q>An Hour in the Morning is worth three in the Afternoon,</Q> is a common Proverb, and I never knew a truer. The Light, Heat, and Air of the Day is much more healthy and chearful than the cold dark Damps, and Inconveniency of the Night. The brute Creation teaches us this. The dumb Creatures retire early to Rest, and get up betimes, to busy
<PB N="363" REF="372"/>
themselves in Quest of Food, or in bring∣ing forth, or bringing up their Young, or in providing for the Winter. Nature instructs them that the Light and Warmth of the Sun makes that the Time of Busi∣ness; but if we will sit up in the Dead, and Damps, and Darkness of the Night, exposed to the Vapours of that unwhole∣some Season, we must lie late, and there∣by lose a great Part of the proper Time for Business or Study; we must breakfast when others dine, dine when others sup, and sup when they sleep; so that our Time is, as I may say, quite disjointed, and can never hit or square with the Times of Business, Meals, or Visits of other People. By these Irregularities, every Thing goes to Disorder and Confu∣sion; and beside the Loss of so much
<PB N="364" REF="373"/>
Time, (and that the proper Time) the Indolence and Inactivity, that late-sitting-up and late lying-a-bed creates, renders us quite unfit and unapt for making Use of the Residue of Time left for Action.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> has painted this so just and strong in one of the Poems, which I co∣pied out for you, that I need not expa∣tiate further on it.</P>
<P>Would not a Merchant be laughed at for a Fool or Madman, who should loiter away his Time till the Exchange were shut, a Minister till the Time of Divine Service were past, a Lawyer till the Courts were up, or a Physician till the Patient were past Recovery, or dead? It is just as ridiculous and foolish in us, to mis-time,
<PB N="365" REF="374"/>
time the common Affairs, and Busi∣ness of Life. <HI>Solomon,</HI> I think, says, <Q>The slothful Man ploweth in Har∣vest;</Q> meaning that he mis-times his Affairs, and neglects to sow his Grain, till others are going to reap theirs.</P>
<P>Another Means of purchasing Time, is, when we foresee a Crowd of Things coming on us together, and that we shall be hurried, to steal some Time before hand, if we can, to do some Part of it, or block it, as we say, and prepare it so that it may become more easy and light.</P>
<P>I have a great Number of Affairs to do to-morrow; I foresaw them yester∣day. I therefore chose to let Mr. <HI>L</HI>— make a Visit then. I seized the Time,
<PB N="366" REF="375"/>
I had yesterday Afternoon to myself. I have wrote several Letters, which are not to go till to-morrow; have put my Papers in Order, and made a Beginning, in having dispatched all preparatory Work. I only mention this, to illustrate to you what I mean.</P>
<P>I shall give you the Respite of a Day or two, before I pursue this Matter. What I have to say further will be easily discussed.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very well pleased with your judi∣cious Remarks on <HI>Tasso.</HI> I knew you did not prefer <HI>Tasso</HI>'s Description of Night to that of <HI>Virgil,</HI> though I thought pro∣per to observe the Difference of the Choice of Circumstances therein in those two Poets.</P>
<P>I wrote to you in my last about the Purchasing of Time, and shall here add the following Observation; leaving what I have to say farther on the Distribution of Time to another Occasion. A parti∣cular
<PB N="368" REF="377"/>
Piece of Business will prevent me for a While.</P>
<P>What signifies getting Time enough, without being able to use it? If we are lazy, indolent, or indisposed, it will be much the same as if we had it not. It will be like earning a good Meal, with∣out a Stomach to digest it, or an Appe∣tite to eat it; so that if we have ever so much Time, and have not Application, or if we are what the French call <HI>dissipé,</HI> it can be of very little Advantage to us.</P>
<P>In order then to fit us for the right Employment of Time, our Mind ought to be cool and serene, our Thoughts clear, our Spirits in Vigour, but undis∣turbed, and not in a Flurry. The Means
<PB N="369" REF="378"/>
to attain this Disposition is to endeavour to be in good Health of Body. There is a strange Sympathy and Connection be∣tween the Body and Mind; the one is seldom well, when the other is out of Order. I am not going to prescribe to you as a Doctor; not being skilled in that Profession; but certainly Regula∣rity and Moderation, in Eating, Drink∣ing, Sleep, Exercises, Study, Business, and Diversions, are the best Means of preserving Health, and consequently of attaining an Easiness and Calm of Mind, joined with Clearness and Strength of Thought.</P>
<P>But there are some other Things, that incapacitate us for Study or Business, which arise from the Mind itself. All
<PB N="370" REF="379"/>
immoderate Passions, such as Grief, An∣ger, too earnest Desires, an inordinate Pursuit of Pleasure, or Trifles, and set∣ting a too high Value on them, all these dissipate our Minds, unnerve and weaken them; and at last sink them, leaving no∣thing but the Dregs of Thought behind.</P>
<P>Another Consideration should make us still more careful to avoid whatever impairs or destroys our Health of Body, or the Faculties of our Mind. The Body and Mind do not only act upon, and affect one another mutually, but they re-act again and again upon each other; like a Ball tossed to and fro, forward and backward, in a Tennis-Court; Grief, Rage, Envy, or any other violent Pas∣sions, do not only disturb and distract
<PB N="371" REF="380"/>
the Mind, but they affect the Health; when the Health is affected, these Pas∣sions become more violent, and less supportable; these Passions, when be∣come more violent, give a new Wound to the Health, which adds fresh Force, or, at least, more Malignity, to the Passions, and so on reciprocally; and if <HI>God,</HI> out of his infinite Goodness, had not given us such Constitutions, as some∣times to get the better of all this, <HI>we do not know how,</HI> this Action and Re-action would certainly destroy us; indeed, it very often does.</P>
<P>I shall refer the Remainder to my next, and am,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have written you my Thoughts, in the best Manner I can, about pur∣chasing Time, and how that Time may not be useless, by our being in an unfit Disposition to use it. The Question now is, how that Time ought to be distribut∣ed, laid out, or bestowed.</P>
<P>There are two or three general Rules I would have you observe.</P>
<P>First, reckon with yourself, how much Time such or such a Thing may take,
<PB N="373" REF="382"/>
then how much such another Thing, and so on, and divide and distribute your Time accordingly.</P>
<P>But then in the next, or rather in the first Place, you ought to make a sort of Calculation or Reckoning of how many Things you have to do; as for Exam∣ple, to-day, or to-morrow, and forecast in your Mind, in what Order you will do them.</P>
<P>Then consider what Time is most pro∣per for the one, and what for the other; what in the Morning, what in the After∣noon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By all Means, consider what is most necessary, what is most valuable, what
<PB N="374" REF="383"/>
deserves most Time. Common Sense, and the universal Consent of the World, allow that these are to be most minded; so that if you have Time, the greatest Portion of that, as well as of Care, Pains, Application, and Study, are to be laid out on Things that deserve it best, or that we are most interested in, or what must be necessarily done; and if, in Spite of all our Endeavours, we have not Time enough, and are hurried, we ought al∣ways to prefer what is most necessary and most valuable.</P>
<P>Some People, when hurried either unavoidably, or through their own Fault, will leave nothing undone, but do a little of every thing, and so slubber their Af∣fairs, that nothing is done to the Pur∣pose;
<PB N="375" REF="384"/>
whereas it would have been much better in that Hurry, to have left the less necessary Things absolutely untouched, till another Occasion.</P>
<P>The Purchase of Time will put us out of the Necessity of being hurried; being in good Health and Spirits will double Time, and keep us from being languid; forecasting the Particulars will keep us from an Uncertainty and Irreso∣lution of what we are to do.</P>
<P>The due Distribution of Time, and chusing the most proper Seasons, is neces∣sary to doing Things well and effec∣tually.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="385"/>The Preference of Things, or Studies, that are most necessary, valuable, or profitable, will always make our Bu∣siness and Study most advantageous to us.</P>
<P>To this I shall add, that in Things indifferent, we ought to consult our Bent and Humour; if it is not inclined to what is trifling, or worse, to what our Genius is fittest for. We shall assuredly learn much more, and more to the Pur∣pose, when we apply to what we have a Turn for, than to what is <HI>against the Grain.</HI></P>
<P>I only hint these Points to you, with∣out expatiating on them, which indeed I have not Time for at present, nor do
<PB N="377" REF="386"/>
I think it needful. Your own good Sense will see into the Truth of them, and reflect and enlarge upon them.</P>
<P>I own, such is human Frailty, that we cannot, at all Times, come up to the strict Observance of them, even with all our Endeavours; but we should surely strive to do it, in the Main, and as forcibly as we are able.</P>
<P>I own too, that Sickness, Indisposi∣tion, unforeseen Accidents, Visits, Avo∣cations, and Interruptions of many Sorts, and even Business itself, will break in on these Rules; but they ought not surely to be wholly neglected, because they cannot be precisely kept.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="387"/>These Rules are general, and will al∣ways hold true, at least, in my humble Opinion; and if they always hold true, we should always endeavour to keep to them, with those Allowances above. I do not think I need trouble you with any more of this Kind, nor in∣deed do I immediately recollect any; but there are some particular Things, which, in a long Course of Time, I have observed; these are a sort of <HI>Knacks,</HI> if I may call them so, of studying, or doing Business in an useful Way. Every Man, I suppose, has some of those peculiar to himself, and there may be many which I never heard of; but such as have been observed by me I shall make the Subject of my next Letter; and I am confident, from Experience,
<PB N="379" REF="388"/>
that they cannot fail of being very ser∣viceable to any Person, who pleases to practise them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 7, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 4th of this Month, with which I am very well pleased.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="389"/>I would fain give you a true Idea of the Importance of the few Rules or Directions which I offered you in my late Letters.</P>
<P>Consider then that our Time is li∣mited; we have but a certain Portion of Time to live, and even That of the longest Liver is but very short. How great a Part of it is taken up in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Dressing, Company, Avocations, Interruptions, and many other Functions of Life, that are ne∣cessary and indispensable, or, at least, unavoidable! Add to these, Indisposi∣tion, Sickness, the Decays of old Age, and the Cares of Life, which grow upon us daily.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="390"/>But if we were to live ever so long, pray consider that our Understandings and Memories are limited, and are very short and imperfect; even those Persons, whose Memories are strongest and most tena∣cious, can retain but very few Things, in Comparison with what they see, hear, read, and observe. Many Things slide out of our Memories, some sooner, others later, and many make no Impres∣sion at all.</P>
<P>In like Manner, our Understandings are limited; some can comprehend more, others less; but the highest Pitch, that human Understanding can fly to, is but very low. There are moreover Thou∣sands of Things, that, if we should rack our Understandings ever so much, we
<PB N="382" REF="391"/>
can never attain to the Knowledge and Comprehension of; they lye without the Sphere and Province of our Con∣ception, or, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> expresses it, <HI>beyond the Length of our Tether.</HI></P>
<P>Philosophers say, there are certain Cells in the Brain, some of which are the Seats of our Reason or Understand∣ings, and others of our Memory. Some are more capacious than others; others not so capacious, but hold, what they receive better; however there is but a limited Number, and, when full, they can hold no more; or, at least, new Ideas, when they take Place, justle out the old ones.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="392"/>If Time were to endure for ever, or very long, we need not be so solicitous of husbanding it well; or, short as it is, if our Understandings and Memories were infinite, or, at least, of a vast Compass, we could do a great deal in a small Space. But as the wise Author of our Being has disposed Things otherwise, ought we not to obey the Limitation he has prescribed us?</P>
<P>To divide and distribute our Time aright, should we not endeavour to be in a Disposition of Mind and Body, to be able to take Time, when Time is, and to chuse fit and proper Periods for acting, and when we are disposed and capable to use Time?</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="393"/>Ought we not to prefer what is pro∣per, useful, worthy and necessary, to that which is less so? much more to Trifles, (unless for Diversion or Recreation) and, most of all, to what is bad, hurtful, or vicious?</P>
<P>If you, or I, or any one else, waste Time in reading useless Books, or in some impertinent Thing or frivolous Employ, the idle Ideas we lay up jus∣tle, or keep out, as many good and wholesome ones; if they slide away, and leave Room for better, which is the best that can befall us in such a Case, we have, at least, lost so much Time; but if they fix on our Memory and Un∣derstanding, then indeed our State is doubly miserable. I still except neces∣sary
<PB N="385" REF="394"/>
Recreations, and the particular Trades or Business, wherein we are brought up, and by which we must get a Lively∣hood; many whereof are in themselves trifling enough, but then they are ne∣cessary, as being the Means of Sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>Now if the proper Times and parti∣cular Seasons of Application, and when we are fit and capable to apply, are to be watched and taken, how much more is the Time of Life, in general, which is fittest for us, and to which we are best suited, to be well and diligently ap∣plied? I mean, the Time of our Youth, when the Journey of Life is before us, when we have most Leisure, before we are engaged in the Cares and Concerns
<PB N="386" REF="395"/>
of the World we are to struggle through; when our Minds are most pliable, and when we receive the deepest and most lasting Impressions; when we have a certain Facility both of taking up Things, and retaining them—On all Accounts, therefore, Youth is the most proper Sea∣son to lay in a Fund for carrying us through the World with Comfort, and Joy, and Innocence, and Credit. How many Wretches do we see of both Sexes, who, for Want of this Precaution and Provision, lead miserable and disgraceful Lives, and come to an untimely and shameful End!</P>
<P>There is one Thing in regard to the Narrowness of our Understanding, which give me Leave to mention to you.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="396"/>Some Things are hard, and require much Attention to be comprehended aright. If these Things are necessary, or worth our While, the Difficulty ought not to frighten us; but if they are other∣wise, we should not break our Heads about them. Some have a Genius for one Thing, some for another; and it is wonderful to observe how ready and able some People are to learn some Things, and how hard it is to make them comprehend others, which one would think much easier.</P>
<P><HI>Pope</HI> has treated this with great Jus∣tice, somewhere in his Works; I think it is in the fourth Book of his <HI>Dunciad.</HI> He laughs at the Practice of our Schools and Colleges, where they set every Boy
<PB N="388" REF="397"/>
to the making of Verses, without con∣sidering whether he has Talents for it or no.</P>
<P>I have been often told that the Jesuits abroad take a quite different Method with their Pupils. They carefully study the Temper and Turn of Mind, and when they have discovered that, they then set them to that which their Genius is most suited to.</P>
<P>But some Things lie quite out of the Reach of our Understanding. All the natural Philosophers, that have been or are now in the World, have not hitherto been able to account for Thousands of Things, that present themselves to us every Day; why, for Example, the Grass
<PB N="389" REF="398"/>
is green, the Rose red, the Lily white, the Cowslip yellow, the Violet blue, the Tulip variegated or party-coloured; why a certain Sort of Tree always bears an Apple, another a Pear, a third a Plumb, and so forth, with Millions of other Things. We have but few Faculties, and fewer Senses, which are the Inlets of all Knowledge. All the Descriptions and Definitions that can be made, will never give a Man, who was born blind, the least Idea or Notion of a Colour, or one born deaf, any Notion of Sound. Things being thus, how idle is it in People to puzzle themselves with Ob∣jects that lie without the Sphere of their Knowledge or Comprehension! And if it be so in these lesser Matters, how rash is it, with regard to the high and tre∣mendous
<PB N="390" REF="399"/>
Mysteries of our Religion, in presuming Men to endeavour to explain them to others, who cannot comprehend them themselves!</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> Father to the present Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> did more Hurt to Re∣ligion, (at least in my Opinion) though undesignedly, by endeavouring to explain the <HI>Trinity,</HI> than if he had wrote a Trea∣tise against it.</P>
<P>Others presumptuously and prophanely contemn and deride, desperately reject and renounce our Holy Religion, and the sacred Treasures of the Scripture, because, forsooth, they cannot compre∣hend every thing taught there; as if
<PB N="391" REF="400"/>
nothing could be true, but what they could account for; although they see ten thousand Things every Day, that are obvious to their Senses, and yet not one of them can be accounted for by the Wit of all Mankind put to∣gether.</P>
<P>Such Scoffers as these would per∣haps term what I am saying <HI>Cant</HI>; they have many low Arts and Expressions, to support each other in such vain Tenets, as are not to be justified by Reason. God forbid they should ever affect the sober and meek! Better is it for us to be submissive, teachable, and humble-minded, than to sail along with a Tide of Fools, whose greatest
<PB N="392" REF="401"/>
Comfort must be, the Hope of being <HI>Nothing</HI> at last.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 11, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Resume my Discourse on the Employ∣ment of Time.</P>
<P>Besides the few general Rules, which every Body should observe as much as
<PB N="393" REF="402"/>
their Health and Disposition of Mind and Business will allow them, there are some particular Things, which, if observed, will, in my Opinion, tend much to our bestowing Time to Purpose.</P>
<P>But there is one of these general Rules, which I must again recommend, as a certain Knack or Nostrum to make Time pass easily and profitably, and that is what I called <HI>forecasting</HI> what we have to do, or what we design to read or study; for Instance, in the Evening what we are to do next Day, or in the Morning, what we are to do all Day, or for two or three Days to come.</P>
<P>There are many excellent Effects fol∣low on this Method;</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="403"/>First, we find hereby when we shall have a void Space of Time; we can therefore fill it up with some∣thing that would oppress us afterwards; or we can beforehand, if we have no Business that will hurry us after, contrive something to do or read, or some Di∣version that would encroach too much on Business at another Time, or contrive our Visits so as not to encroach on Bu∣siness at all.</P>
<P>It would also give us a View of all we had to do, at once, so that we should not only proportion our Time aright, but even chuse the fittest Time for every Branch of our Business and Diversion.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="404"/>We should moreover not be at a Loss or Doubt, what to do first, or whether to do such a Thing or not. I have often felt, that, when I was surprised with an idle Space of Time, for Want of having forcasted what I was to do, I continued in Doubt and Irresolution, and in a saun∣tering Disposition, and as much to seek, as when I happened to be surprised with a Hurry of Business, not knowing where or how to begin. This is the Reason that so many People are longer in be∣ginning and falling to Action, than others are in compleating it. Many People have I seen come to a Friend's House, in order to spend an Afternoon, but presently, perhaps, they remembered they had something to do, then away they would go; then, perhaps, change
<PB N="396" REF="405"/>
their Minds and come back again, I have seen People go in and out of a Cof∣fee-House, three or four Times in half an Hour; or go, perhaps, along half a Street, then turn short, and go another Way, or turn back. All this comes from not forecasting what they have to do, and not having resolved to do what they have suddenly taken into their Heads.</P>
<P>No Doubt, you have seen all this as well as I, and I do not say that I have not been guilty of it as well as others.</P>
<P>I have been in Company where I have seen People that were for the Park; then for Vaux-Hall, and not the Park; then for neither, but for the Play-House; then
<PB N="397" REF="406"/>
not for that, but for the Tavern; yet, at last, went to none of them. My God! how uneasy are these People to them∣selves, and often to others! All proceeds, I say, from not forecasting Things be∣forehand, and Want of Resolution to exe∣cute what they intend. In short, the good Effects of Forecast are so visible, and the bad Effects of the Want of it so obvious, that I need not longer dwell upon it.</P>
<P>I must refer the rest to my next.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I wrote you last, I have been much in the Country, and besides there has been such a Hurry in this Town, with Horse-Races, Balls, Con∣certs, and a World of Company, that I had not Time to write as I de∣signed.</P>
<P>I have three Letters of yours unan∣swered, all on the same Subject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tasso's Jerusalem delivered.</NOTE>, and am very well pleased with them.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="408"/>What they call the <HI>Fortunate Islands</HI> is certainly fabulous, as the Gardens of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> the Grotto of <HI>Circe</HI> and <HI>Calypso,</HI> and the <HI>Hesperian</HI> Gardens. Whether any of the Antients found the Way to the <HI>Azores</HI> Islands, or our <HI>Bermudas</HI> Islands, which, it is said, bid fair to an∣swer the poetical Descriptions, is more than we know, or whether they took their Hints from some dark Account of Paradise. <HI>Homer</HI> wrote (his <HI>Odyssey</HI>) near three thousand Years ago, <HI>Tasso,</HI> I believe, not above three Hundred. I cannot conceive why he differs from <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI> in his Account of <HI>Ulysses.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO resume my Discourse on Time— The last Rule, I think, that I wished to be observed, to stop weari∣some
<PB N="401" REF="410"/>
Gaps in Time, was either to pre∣pare something that we know is before our Hand, or resume something that we had not Time to finish. This is an ex∣cellent Method of keeping ourselves from Indolence and Idleness, and forwarding our Business, Study, or Knowledge; and nothing so much contributes to make this easy and practicable, as fore-laying every thing we have to do. When we look before us, we shall see what Time we are like to be disengaged, and then we can provide for the right Use of that Time.</P>
<P>Another Point I would recommend, is as follows. When we have not any thing to prepare beforehand, nor any thing to do that was obliged to be left
<PB N="402" REF="411"/>
undone, suppose we were to think of some By-Study, or useful Matter to em∣ploy ourselves in, that should touch us but on such Occasions.</P>
<P>For Example, Nancy, what if you, in such a Case, should get the Use of some News-Papers, particularly the Ge∣neral or London Evening Post, read them over, and even the Advertisements? You would there find many Things, of which you have, as yet, perhaps, no Idea. As all <HI>Europe</HI> is now in Motion, you would hereby have a Conception of what is doing, and what you cannot miss to hear talked of; and if you would lay out a Trifle on a Map of <HI>Europe</HI> in general, and of the particular Countries likewise, and consult your Maps for every Thing
<PB N="403" REF="412"/>
you read about, it would be a very fine, and no unprofitable, Amusement; for by this Means, and, as it were, by Way of Diversion, you would come to un∣derstand Geography, and comprehend what is now so much in the Mouths of all the World. This would give you the Pleasure of understanding what you hear and read, of forming, with some Exactness, an Idea of the Countries and Actions you read of, which none can do, who know not the Situations of Places, where the Scene of Action lies. Such Persons as know not, for Exam∣ple, where <HI>France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Prussia,</HI> &amp;c. are, whether they lie East, West, North, or South, or how they lie in respect to each other, or whe∣ther they are near or far off, what Plea∣sure
<PB N="404" REF="413"/>
can they have in <HI>Prince Charles's</HI> passing and re-passing the <HI>Rhine,</HI> or what Notion can they have of his Marches, and the Marches of his Enemies? Why really, scarce any.</P>
<P>I would not, however, have you be either a great Geographer, or News-Monger; but this would not only be pleasant Amusement in idle Hours, but would enable you to have right Notions and Ideas of Things that are often talked of. Now this, or some such Employ, I would have you set apart only for the Hours you find yourself languid in; but, by no means, let it encroach on the Times of Business, and when you are more necessarily, and more impor∣tantly engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="414"/>There is another Thing, in which Time that lies heavy on our Hands might be still more usefully employed, and that is, in doing some Handy-Work. I have many Times regretted that I ne∣ver learned to do, or make, some useful Thing or other, to fill up these tedious Intervals. I have known Gentlemen learn to Draw, or Play on some Instru∣ment, or Work at some useful Art, especially <HI>Turning,</HI> which is easily learn∣ed; and I have seen a Lady lately sit five or six Hours at making Nets, Flow∣ering or Embroidering. Such Employ∣ments as these often turn out advantage∣ous Concerns to those who are not ca∣pable of high Pursuits, and are happy Relaxations to those who are.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 21, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote you three Days ago; what I have more to say will not take up much Time, but I shall spin it out to two Letters.</P>
<P>One Thing earnestly to be recom∣mended, as the Means of making either Study or Business useful and effectual, is to improve the Times and Circum∣stances, that favour them. There are certain Seasons and Occasions, by, and
<PB N="407" REF="416"/>
in, which we can profit more than others. I do not only mean what I wrote formerly about the proper Times of the Day for this or that, and the Times when we find ourselves in the best Disposition, or when the best Op∣portunities offer, (tho' these are to be greatly noticed) yet I now mean some∣thing more.</P>
<P>There are Accidents or Circumstances, that contribute much to make deep Impressions on the Mind and Memory. For Example, when we hear any Thing that is <HI>new</HI> to us; this excites the Cu∣riosity, and is a proper Time to inform ourselves about it. When a Thing is strange or surprising, or when it comes newly in Vogue, or when we hear
<PB N="408" REF="417"/>
many People talk about a Book, or other Matter, or commend, or discom∣mend it, or when we hear different Characters of some Circumstance or Au∣thor, or when People contest and dis∣pute about any Thing, then the Mind is excited; and such Opportunities of Improvement are never to be neglected, unless the Subject is of no Concern; but even in that Case, People will remem∣ber, or be curious to know Things in such Circumstances.</P>
<P>Not only Things that are new, un∣common, or extraordinary, make deep Impressions, but what we learn, hear, read, or do, at such Times, make deep Impressions too. There is a certain Con∣nection of Ideas that I cannot account
<PB N="409" REF="418"/>
for, by which they are drawn along, as by a Chain of different Links. You have heard People say, <Q>I remember such a Circumstance very well, be∣cause such a Thing happened at that Time, or I was in such a Place.</Q> If we change our usual Place of Resi∣dence, or our customary Way of Life, we shall, for some little While, remem∣ber better what happened, or what we read, heard, or saw, in that Interval, than what occurs ordinarily; and I have often observed, when I have come to a Place or Company, from which I had been some Time absent, my former Thoughts have then come back into my Mind, tho' perhaps I had never once reflected on them, from the Time
<PB N="410" REF="419"/>
I had been before in that Place or Com∣pany.</P>
<P>It is for this Reason, that those who teach <HI>the Art of Memory,</HI> lay down this Rule; namely, that <HI>when we have many Things to remember, we should join the Idea of some very known Place, Person, or Circumstance, to the Thing, we would remember</HI>; and we even see People, who never studied Rules, very commonly use this Method. How often have we heard People say, <Q>This, that, or the other Circumstance, will make me remem∣ber her such a Particular, or such, or such a Thing recalls it to my Mind.</Q></P>

<P>THE next Thing, I would recom∣mend, is to conquer that Indolence, which some People are, either constitu∣tionally or habitually, encumbered with. I know this is a very hard Lesson, and what I could never absolutely be Master of myself. What is accompanied with Difficulties, or what is not to our Taste, we bring ourselves to do with great Re∣luctance; and we satisfy ourselves with any Sort of Excuse, to put it off and delay it, from Time to Time. I have often experienced this in myself; but if
<PB N="412" REF="421"/>
the Thing we thus fly from, is either necessary or proper, we ought, by all Means, to compel ourselves to do it, and even offer Violence to our Tempers, to overcome this Indolence. The best Method I know for this, is to take the first Opportunity when we are in a pro∣per Disposition, and <HI>to make a Beginning.</HI> Thus all the Poets and Philosophers advise. <HI>Ovid</HI> says, "He, who has made a good Beginning, has half-ended his Business."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Dimidium, Qui bene caepit, habet."</NOTE> <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Perseus</HI> say the same; <HI>Incipe,</HI> that is, <HI>Begin,</HI> is their constant Rule. I will not give you the Translation of a noble Passage from <HI>Ho∣race,</HI> it is so wretchedly rendered, but
<PB N="413" REF="422"/>
one of our Poets says, much to the same Purpose,
<Q><L>Begin —</L>
<L>Defer not till to-morrow to be wise,</L>
<L>To-morrow's Sun to thee may never rise.</L></Q>
There is indeed nothing like making once a Beginning in earnest, for, by lit∣tle and little, we are reconciled to the Subject and Task. Then Difficulties be∣gin to vanish, at least, they grow smooth∣er and easier by Degrees, especially if we set our Hearts to conquer them; and so, what was once our Aversion, be∣comes, at last, easy, and often a Plea∣sure to us.</P>
<P>The next Point to be observed, is to conquer our Curiosity. When we find
<PB N="414" REF="423"/>
our Hearts set upon some Reading, Bu∣siness, or Diversion, that is improper, we should endeavour to master that Pas∣sion, and make it submit to our Advan∣tage; otherwise, every new Thing that surprises us, or that we are fond of, will make us break off, and turn away from the Pursuit of what is useful to us.</P>
<P>But in either Case, that is, when our Indolence, Aversion, or Curiosity, is so strong that we cannot conquer it at once, we ought to do it by Degrees. We may be in so unfit a Disposition, that our Struggling can do us no Good, at one Time; then, perhaps, we had better give Way, for that Instant, resolving not to yield it up, but get the better by Degrees. I have been seized with such
<PB N="415" REF="424"/>
a strong Curiosity, that if I had not in∣dulged it for that Time, all other Appli∣cations had been useless; for Example, on Receipt of some extraordinary News, or Letters long expected, and often on Receipt of Letters from you, that, tho' I had compelled myself not to read them, (which I could have done) yet I could not have done any Thing else to Pur∣pose, 'till I had perused them, so much have they ran in my Head.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE last Point I would recommend in Study or Business, is what we call <HI>Method.</HI> The chief Rule herein, where the Nature of the Study requires it, is to get a general Idea of our Sub∣ject-Matter, in all its different Parts. When we have seen through it, we should range those Parts in some Order, and fix them in our Mind. Thus seen through, the Affair will become much easier. Were we even but learning
<PB N="417" REF="426"/>
some new Game at Cards, it may be reasonably imagined that this Method will make us comprehend it much bet∣ter, and more easily.</P>
<P>Our next Care is to be Master of the chief Difficulties, which will still ob∣struct our Knowledge, and hang a dead Weight upon us, in the Course of our Studies, if not absolutely mastered. For Instance, in the French Language, those who will not be at the Pains to get the two Auxiliary Verbs <HI>Avoir</HI> and <HI>Etre</HI> perfectly at first, will find a heavy Clog lie upon them, through the whole Study of that Tongue, which will cost them ten Times the Pains, that would be ne∣cessary to learn them perfectly at first.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="427"/>You know yourself that there are some Rules of Practice, which make Things easy; and without which, we may puz∣zle our whole Life over, without coming to our Purpose, or, at best, spend a long Time, and bestow vast Labour in resol∣ving them. By common Arithmetick we may blacken many Sheets of Paper, and bestow many Hours, nay, even Days, to resolve a Question, which by Decimals or Algebra may be resolved in a few Minutes. But to illustrate this by an Instance familiar to yourself, how many Tricks at Cards have you shewed me, that I could never find out or ac∣count for, unless you had pointed out the Method?</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon,</HI> <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 2, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU say there is Part of a former Letter, which you do not clearly comprehend; and I can perceive that you think I have given contradictory
<PB N="420" REF="429"/>
Rules, though you do not so express your∣self. I proceed to explain it.</P>
<P>There is a great Difference between conquering or subduing our Passions, and extinguishing them. It is certainly our Duty to be Masters of our Passions and Appetites, but not to extinguish them, for they were given us by the wise Author of our Nature for excellent Purposes. Without them, we should never be at Pains to do any good or great Action; and therefore when they are subservient to our Reason, they bear the Mind up against Fatigue, Indolence, and In-appli∣cation; but they make sad Work, when they reign and tyrannize over us. What <HI>Horace</HI> has said of Anger, may be said of every Passion and Appetite. I must
<PB N="421" REF="430"/>
give it you in the disadvantageous Trans∣lation of <HI>Creech.</HI>
<Q><L>Anger it a short Frenzy; curb thy Soul,</L>
<L>And check thy Rage, which must be rul'd, or rule;</L>
<L>Use all thy Art, with all thy Force restrain,</L>
<L>And take the strongest Bit, and firmest Rein.</L></Q>
It is certain, that if we do not get the Mastery of our Passions, they will be our Masters—<HI>They must be ruled, or rule.</HI> Now to apply this to the Difficulty you propose.</P>
<P>It is most certainly a proper Oppor∣tunity to learn a Thing, when our Cu∣riosity is excited by some Accident. Then the Application will be vigorous, the
<PB N="422" REF="431"/>
Impressions deep, and will continue long. Yet, notwithstanding this, <HI>Reason,</HI> which is the <HI>Image of God</HI> in our Minds, and which distinguishes us from all the lower Creation, <HI>Reason,</HI> I say, should preside and controul.</P>
<P>If the Thing our Curiosity is employed about, is worth our While, we may then give the Reins to our Curiosity; otherwise, let us call in Reason to our Aid; let her keep her Seat, and do her Office. We must then <HI>take our strongest Bit, and firmest Rein.</HI> This is a Meta∣phor, you see, taken from riding. The Rider is our Reason, the Horse, the Passions; which we must sometimes give the Reins to, sometimes check, some∣times spur and switch, but, at all Times,
<PB N="423" REF="432"/>
direct and manage. You perceive all this agrees with what was first said, namely, that the Passions are to be go∣verned, moderated, and subdued, but not extinguished, any more than a Horse, instead of being broke and trained, ought to be knocked on the Head, or all the Blood in the Body let out to cure a Fever, or the Head to be cut off, to cure a Vertigo.</P>
<P>Again, there is a great Difference be∣tween some strong and sudden Gusts and Fits of Passion, Curiosity, for Instance, and an habitual Dominion of the Pas∣sions over us. The best and wisest of Men may be now and then surprized, as the best Rider may be thrown, when
<PB N="424" REF="433"/>
he is not on his Guard, especially; now I say, in such a Case, for Example, if a strong Fit of Curiosity possesses us, which we cannot conquer, as in the Particulars I mentioned to you, it is bet∣ter to yield a little for the Time, than to struggle in vain; yet, by no Means, to let it run into a Habit, but resume the Reins, as soon as possible. Just so, there are sometimes Fits of Indolence, Indisposition, Weariness, and Listlessness, if I may call it so, which seize us, and must be yielded Way to, for a short Time; but, if encouraged, are considera∣bly more dangerous than the other; and for this good Reason, that all active Pas∣sions, such as Curiosity, decrease in Time, and wear out, or grow weaker by their
<PB N="425" REF="434"/>
own Activity, as Things in Motion tend to Rest, at last; but Indolence, the more it is humoured, the more it grows, as Things at Rest never tend to Motion again of themselves, but must be put into Motion by a new Force; and if they are heavy Bodies, the longer they lie on the Earth, the deeper they sink into if. This common and daily Expe∣rience shews us.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall now give you the famous Mons. <HI>Des-Cartes</HI> four Rules of Me∣thod.</P>
<P>Rule I. <Q>To admit nothing for Truth, but what you hare fully examined, and found to be so true, as that you have no Reason to doubt it; and to conclude nothing absolutely, but what you see clearly to follow from what you have so considered.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="436"/>This Rule is of excellent Use, to find out the Truth in Things of Difficulty, or to attain to the Knowledge of what requires Application. But I must warn you, that there are many Things, where this is not necessary, as in Things <HI>qui sautent aux Yeux,</HI> as the French say, Things clear and obvious in themselves, or Things that commonly occur in Life, or are generally known and practised; and in Things that do not concern you whether they be true or false, and in many trifling Matters. For Want of this Precaution, I have heard of some Ad∣mirers of <HI>Des-Cartes,</HI> who have run into unaccountable Follies, and have given themselves great Disquiet, in applying his Rules on every Occasion, and have
<PB N="428" REF="437"/>
thereby made their Lives a Burthen to selves.</P>
<P>Rule II. <Q>That all the Difficulties you are to examine, be divided into such and so many Parts as are necessary, in order to attain the Knowledge of what you pursue.</Q></P>
<P>I shall say nothing on this Rule; I think the Usefulness of it is very plain.</P>
<P>Rule III. <Q>To dispose all the Parti∣culars you are to consider, in the most natural Order.</Q></P>
<P>That is, you are to consider the more simple and plain Things, before the more compounded and perplexed; those
<PB N="429" REF="438"/>
that are necessary to be first understood, before those that arise out of them. For Example, in Arithmetic, which you un∣derstand a little.</P>
<P>A Numeration-Table stands first; then we learn to add Numbers to Num∣bers; the next Thing that naturally fol∣lows, is to take Numbers from Num∣bers, which is most easily learned, after we have learned to add Numbers. This is called Substraction. After this, Mul∣tiplication becomes familiar and easy; then follows Division, which requires both Addition, Subtraction, and Multi∣plication in the Operation.</P>
<P>In <HI>Euclid</HI>'s famous Principles of the Mathematics, called his <HI>Elements,</HI> he pro∣ceeds
<PB N="430" REF="439"/>
in this admirable Method. His first Proposition is necessary to the un∣derstanding the second, the second to the third, the third to the fourth, and so on. This I think sufficient to explain what I mean.</P>
<P>This Rule, however, only holds good in Things that have a Relation or Con∣nection, and Dependence on one ano∣ther. As for Example, in learning <HI>French,</HI> as I said before, we shall be continually at a Loss, if we do not make ourselves Masters of the auxiliary Verbs, <HI>avoir</HI> and <HI>étre,</HI> because they run into every Verb. Yet I think the surest Way to get the <HI>French</HI> is to begin, after these two Verbs, with the other Verbs regular and irregular, though they are much
<PB N="431" REF="440"/>
harder than Nouns, Pronouns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Reason is, there is no such necessary Connection between these and Verbs, that they must be learned first, in order to gain the other; and as we remember best what we learn first in the Study of Languages, I am firmly of Opi∣nion, that Verbs ought to be first at∣tained.</P>
<P>Rule IV. <Q>To be sure to omit no∣thing necessary to be taken into the Consideration of the Question you are in Search of, or the Attainment of what you want to know.</Q></P>
<P>How many People have laboured in vain to come to the Ground of a Difficulty, or even attain the Understanding of an
<PB N="432" REF="441"/>
Art or Trade perfectly, by not observing this Rule; and perhaps omitting one ne∣cessary Thing, which made all the rest defective!</P>
<P>Some People have thought a fifth Rule necessary, and indeed I am one of them.</P>
<P>Rule V. <Q>To separate every thing from the Question, that is not per∣tinent to the Resolution of the Dif∣ficulty.</Q></P>
<P>I have often thought this Rule as ne∣cessary as any of the others. When we take any foreign Matter into the State of a Question, or Study of a Point, it embarrasses and perplexes us, and carries
<PB N="433" REF="442"/>
us away on a wrong Scent. You cannot fail to have observed this in People, whose Passions, Prejudices, Inattention, Igno∣rance, or Mistakes, lead them away from the Point in Question, and make them wander quite from the true State of it.</P>
<P>The learned have stated two Kinds of Reasoning in the Mind, Discourse, or Method, as they call it. My next shall be on that Subject, but I shall be very short, and then I have done.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 14, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE two Methods I mentioned, my dear Nancy, are termed by the Learned, the Analytic Method, and the Synthetic Method. These are two Greek Words. The first signifies no more, in plain English, than to resolve, or sepa∣rate, and take into Pieces; the latter, to compound or lay together; and in all Things that we would learn or know, one or other of these must be followed; for we must either separate the Subject into different Parts, and consider those distinctly, or we must put them toge∣ther,
<PB N="435" REF="444"/>
and consider them jointly, and see what will be the Result.</P>
<P>But these two Methods are not indif∣ferent to every Sort of Subject. The Nature of some requires to be considered analytically, others synthetically, and to come at the Knowledge of some Things, both must be used.</P>
<P>In Grammar, that is, the learning of a Language, the analytical Method is used to understand to read, write, or speak a Language; we consider the dif∣ferent Parts of Speech, as Nouns, Pro∣nouns, Verbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In Nouns we con∣sider the Substantives and Adjectives; we divide them into declinable and indecli∣nable; we divide the Declensions, con∣sider
<PB N="436" REF="445"/>
the different Cases, Numbers, Gen∣ders, and so forth. In Pronouns we consider the first, second, and third Per∣son, the demonstrative, relative, and pos∣sessive. Verbs we divide into regular and irregular; then into active, passive, neu∣ter, and reciprocal; then we consider them in their different Moods, Tenses, Persons, and Numbers. This is suffi∣cient to make you apprehend the Use∣fulness of this Method, called analytical.</P>
<P>In Logic, that is, the Art of Reason∣ing, we proceed in another Manner. Here we begin with simple Perception, or what is called a single Idea. Then we proceed to Judgment, that is, con∣sidering two Ideas together, and com∣paring them and finding the Relation or
<PB N="437" REF="446"/>
Want of Relation between them. For Example, when we consider the Ideas of Fire and Heat together, we pronounce "that Fire is hot." When we consider and compare the Ideas we have of God and Death, or Sin, we find a Want of Relation, or an Incompatibility between them; hence we pronounce, <Q>God is not subject to Death, or to Sin.</Q></P>
<P>When we have thus formed a Judg∣ment, we can go further, and carry on our Reasoning in a Chain; as thus— <Q>If God cannot sin, he must necessa∣rily be good; if he cannot die, he must be eternal.</Q> This is called Dis∣course; which Word does not properly signify <HI>talking</HI> as we use it, but reason∣ing, and laying Things together, or
<PB N="438" REF="447"/>
separating them, and so finding out In∣ferences.</P>
<P>We then proceed to <HI>Method</HI>; which is, ordering and disposing our Thoughts, so as best to attain the Knowledge of what we want to find out, by either or both of the afore-mentioned Ways; and all the Art of Logic depends on these four Operations on the Mind, to wit, Perception, Judgment, Discourse, and Method.</P>
<P>Thus in Geometry, a <HI>Point</HI> is first considered; next to that a <HI>Line,</HI> which is a Continuation of Points; this gives us the Idea of Length; the next is the Idea of Breadth; from these two we have the Idea of <HI>Surface</HI>; and when to
<PB N="439" REF="448"/>
Length and Breadth we take in Depth, we get the Idea of a <HI>Solid.</HI> From these Ideas arise all our Notions of Squares, Curves, Triangles, Cubes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with all their Proportions and Relations.</P>
<P>You have now, I doubt not, a just Notion of what is called analytical, what synthetical, and of the Usefulness of their different Operations.</P>
<P>I said that in some Studies both Me∣thods may be necessary; and they may be so, either in some different Parts of a long or intricate Question, or even sometimes to the right understanding of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="449"/>To give the best Idea hereof that I can, take this familiar Illustration.</P>
<P>Suppose you wanted to know the Ma∣chinery and Movements of a Watch, it would be necessary to take the whole Movement in Pieces before you, to ex∣plain the Use of every Part, to make you observe the Shape, Form, and Figure of each, to shew you how it is fitted for such or such an Use, or Purpose, and how its Structure contributes to this Use. This is the <HI>Analytical</HI> Method. But to make you understand it perfectly, would it not, think you, be proper to put it together again before you, and to shew you thereby how each Part corresponded with and related to another, and how, from that Construction and Composition, the
<PB N="441" REF="450"/>
Motions arise, and were continued, and conducted to the End, for which a Watch was designed? This is the <HI>Syn∣thetical</HI> Method.</P>
<P>In such an Operation as this, we have Occasion to consider every thing duly, and so to admit nothing to be true, that is to say, fit for the Pur∣pose it is said to be designed for, un∣less it evidently appears so. Here then is a Distribution of the Subject into as many Parts as are necessary; the simple Parts are first considered, then the Connection with others, then these Parts as compounded, and lastly the whole Frame, Composition, or System. Now if all these are duly considered, a nice Discerner will find out what is
<PB N="442" REF="451"/>
wanting, and, by that Means, will omit nothing that is necessary to the Perfec∣tion of the Machine; and if there is any thing amiss, or superfluous, he will be sensible, that it is to be altered, or re∣moved. Herein then are the whole five Rules of Method, mentioned in my for∣mer Letter, comprized.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Greme</HI> (the best Watch-Maker, perhaps, that ever was in the World) had not seen many Watches both taken asunder and put together, and had not considered every Part nicely by itself, and the whole when united, he would never have been able to remove some Things, and to add or alter others, as he has often done, to amazing Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="452"/>I shall add no more on this Sub∣ject, only recommend a Treatise of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s, called <HI>The Conduct of the Un∣derstanding.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 30, 1744.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very well pleased with your Ob∣servations on <HI>Tasso</HI>; they are both in∣genious and just, and no Critic needs be ashamed of them.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="453"/>Since I wrote you last, our Professor of Poetry had a public Speech. It was on the Figure <HI>Prosopopea.</HI> This is, in plain English, <HI>imagining</HI> a Person, and directing our Discourse to him. He divided it into two Kinds, either ap∣plying to a Person absent, or to an ina∣nimate Thing, as if it were a living Person.</P>
<P>This Division is well understood and very common. Thousands of Instances, of both Kinds, are to be found in <HI>Ho∣mer, Virgil, Ovid, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. Of the first Sort there is an Instance near the Beginning of the first Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> where <HI>Aeneas</HI> invokes <HI>Tydides,</HI> as if he were present; but it is much stronger expressed in the Original, than
<PB N="445" REF="454"/>
in the Translation. A noble Instance of the second Sort is in the fourth Book of <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> where <HI>Satan</HI> addresses himself to the <HI>Sun</HI>; and in another Place, where <HI>Eve</HI> talks to the Flowers, Trees, and Brooks, from which she is about to be banished.</P>
<P>But our Professor's chief Design was to shew that there were more strong, more grand, and more emphatical Fi∣gures, of this Kind, in the <HI>Holy Scrip∣tures,</HI> than in all the Poets put toge∣ther. For Instance, <Q>Hear, O Heaven, and give Ear, O Earth.</Q> <HI>Jeremiah</HI> addresses himself to the Sword of the <HI>Lord,</HI> "which," he says, <Q>thirsteth for Blood;</Q> and to his Arrows, which he calls "the Children of his Quiver." He
<PB N="446" REF="455"/>
quoted many more, all very strong and emphatical, and shewed us some of the finest <HI>Prosopopea's</HI> mixed with the strongest and most expressive Metaphors, and other Figures. But he insisted chiefly on a Passage in the Song of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Si∣rak,</HI> where they do not make a <HI>Prosopo∣pea</HI> to the Mother of <HI>Sisera,</HI> but imagine her talking to her Ladies, and thence so impatient as to answer herself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Mother of <HI>Sisera</HI> looked out at a Window, and cried through the Lattice, <Q>Why is his Cha∣riot so long in coming? Why tarry the Wheels of his Chariot?</Q></P><P>Her wise Ladies answered her—Yea, she returned Answer to herself.</P><P><Q>Have they not sped? Have they not divided the Prey, to every Man a Damsel or two? To <HI>Sisera</HI> a Prey of divers Colours, a Prey of divers Colours of Needle-Work, of divers Colours of Needle-Work on both Sides, meet for the Necks of them that take the Spoil?</Q> <HI>Chap.</HI> v. Ver. 28, 29, 30.</P></NOTE>. He
<PB N="447" REF="456"/>
observed the Impatience of a Mother for the Return of her Son, her looking out at the Lattice, her asking her Ladies, her returning Answer to herself, and then the Particulars that ran most in her Head, not Conquest nor Glory, but captive Damsels, and fine gorgeous Raiment; with an Imagination so warm and full, that she describes them as minutely as if she had seen them. This, he said, was na∣tural to the Sex, quoted a similar Pas∣sage in <HI>Virgil,</HI> where <HI>Camilla</HI> is so blinded with the Armour of <HI>Arunces,</HI> that it oc∣casions her to lose her Life. He then made an unfavourable Reflection, name∣ly, how much the female Sex is taken up with Toys, and gaudy Trifles; a Reflection, which, I flatter myself, will
<PB N="448" REF="457"/>
never, with any Justice, be applied to you.</P>
