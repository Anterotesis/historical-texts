<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. BARRY.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first the children of the Muse began</L>
<L>To try their magic on the mind of man,</L>
<L>Astonish'd mortals saw, with wond'ring eyes,</L>
<L>The fair creation of the bard arise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence is deriv'd the Poet's lofty name,</L>
<L>For Poet and Creator mean the same;</L>
<L>He, from his fancy, where the seeds of things</L>
<L>As in a chaos lie, to order brings</L>
<L>Worlds of his own and builds the lofty rhyme</L>
<L>Whose polish'd strength defies the rage of time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such were the bards, whom we too call divine,</L>
<L>Homer the father of the godlike line,</L>
<L>The Mantuan bard, whom all mankind admire</L>
<L>For sweet expression and for vestal fire.</L>
<L>Shakespear and Milton, both in England born,</L>
<L>Whose glorious names the Queen of Isles adorn,</L>
<L>Who, proudly sitting on her azure throne,</L>
<L>In arts and empire will no equal own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far our Author as a Prologue writ,</L>
<L>And would have been, I think, a-writing yet,</L>
<L>Enamour'd of his theme.—But I drew near,</L>
<L>And whisper'd that of him you wish'd to hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas difficult he said—in such a case</L>
<L>He could have wish'd another in his place;</L>
<L>To tell, with what alternate hopes and fears,</L>
<L>An anxious Author on the Stage appears;</L>
<L>For, like the nightingale, he hath addrest</L>
<L>Himself to sing—a thorn at his fond breast.</L>
<L>If, like the native warbler of the grove,</L>
<L>His plaintive notes are full of tender love;</L>
<L>Your hand may pull the thorn that caus'd his pain</L>
<L>And give him spirit for a nobler strain.</L>

<L>My faithful Euran!</L>
<L>Those dastards left their master in the storm</L>

<L>Not one moment's peace</L>

<L>In secret anguish pines her life away!</L>
<L>My son, afflicted, shuns his father's sight,</L>
<L>And, in the woods and forests, wastes his days,</L>
<L>A lonely hunter. To complete my woes,</L>
<L>Our new ally keeps not his promis'd time;</L>

<L>Doubt not, O king!</L>
<L>Doubt not the faith of Durstan, nor the love</L>
<L>He bears his queen.—Soon shall you see his sails</L>
<L>Rise on the distant wave, white as the fowls</L>
<L>That chase the flying shoals.—When he arrives,</L>
<L>Let not indulgence grant the least delay,</L>

<L>When she has left the place, where every tree</L>
<L>And rock and haunted stream recal the memory</L>

<L>Rather the mist</L>
<L>Will thicken into darkness. Euran, my heart</L>
<L>Misgives and chides itself. Sprung as I am</L>
<L>From ancient Albion, in her evil days</L>
<L>I left her shatter'd side. By passion sway'd</L>
<L>And rage at perjur'd Ronan, I forsook</L>
<L>The stock of which I came, and join'd myself</L>
<L>By strict alliance to her mortal foe;</L>

<L>The all-admired daughter of the Isles!</L>

<L>A rover of the main his vessel moor'd;</L>
<L>He told me he had seen on Norway's coast</L>
<L>A fleet immense: far off, it seem'd a wood,</L>

<L>From their eternal mountains had come down,</L>

<L>Leave me to judge</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONNAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>I need not tell Rivine why I shunn'd her,</L>
<L>Since Durstan was her husband; I have fled</L>
<L>The human race, distracted in my mind,</L>
<L>With grief and shame and anger: oft my soul</L>
<L>Resolv'd revenge on Ronan. By-and-by</L>
<L>Something would whisper that we were deceiv'd;</L>
<L>That noble Ronan never could be base.</L>
<L>Perplex'd with thoughts like these, I rang'd the woods,</L>
<L>And heeded not the game my dogs pursu'd.</L>
<L>The storm of yesterday surpriz'd me, stray'd</L>
<L>Beyond my usual bounds; nor could I find,</L>
<L>Amidst the darkness of the driving blast,</L>
<L>A path to guide aright my doubtful steps.—</L>
<L>As night came on, more furious grew the storm.</L>
<L>The thunder bellow'd and the lightning glanc'd</L>
<L>Along the dreary heath: before, behind</L>
<L>And on each side, the sudden torrents roar'd.</L>
<L>I wander'd on and frequently I thought,</L>
<L>The world without was like my troubled mind.</L>
<L>At last, far in the east, whence the wind blew,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heard the howling of a shepherd's dog;</L>
<L>With lighter steps, I turn'd me to the sound</L>
<L>And heard it oft repeated. As I hop'd,</L>
<L>It led me to a hut—I entered there;</L>
<L>And, by the embers of a fire of turf,</L>
<L>I saw a ghastly man stretch'd on a bed</L>

<L>Your charitable cares, he said, are vain;</L>

<L>The noble Ronan, in the hall of kings,</L>
<L>Who sought alliance with so brave a chief,</L>
<L>Fondly display'd—his passion for Rivine.</L>
<L>With gems of thine he deck'd his conq'ring arms,</L>

<SPEAKER>EURAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>I HAVE been sleeping on a hollow bank,</L>
<L>Above a flood unfathom'd.—O! those slaves!</L>
<L>Who gave assurance of the death of Valma,</L>
<L>And boasted each that his good sword dispatch'd him.</L>
<L>The blame as yet on Durstan only falls.</L>
<L>Would I had never join'd my hand to his,</L>
<L>Nor touch'd the proffer'd gold!—Oft have I heard,</L>
<L>And now at last believe, 'tis safer far</L>
<L>To deal deceitfully with crasty men,</L>
<L>Than practise art on unexperienc'd youth,</L>
<L>Whose passions sally out beyond conjecture,</L>
<L>And, by extravagance, confound the wise.</L>
<L>The passions of this prince are like the wind:</L>
<L>The Pictish name is odious to the tribes,</L>
<L>Whose hearts still sway to Albion's kindred race.</L>
<L>If Connan calls to arms, enrag'd they rise,</L>
<L>Like billows when the furious tempest blows.—</L>
<L>The kings have met: how shall I warn the Pict</L>
<L>Without alarming Kathul?—Here they come.</L>

<L>Soon must I quit again this friendly shore;</L>
<L>For I am doom'd to pass my life in arms.—</L>

<L>Congallus, threatens to invade my kingdoms.</L>
<L>This on the seas I learn'd.</L>

<SPEAKER>DURSTAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not in the hearing of these gallant chiefs,</L>

<L>Thou can'st no more deceive me. The long train</L>

<L>Has been detected. Miserable Valma</L>
<L>Liv'd only to reveal it.—Now thou com'st,</L>
<L>With this proud trophy of thy work complete.</L>
<L>O! thou sole relique of the first of men!</L>
<L>Signal of death! memorial of the brave!</L>
<L>Companion of my woes, perhaps the end!</L>
<L>Why didst thou thirst, O! Durstan for his blood?</L>
<L>Hadst thou not wrong'd him, was not that enough</L>
<L>But thou didst wisely, to consult thy safety,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DURSTAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>As in our way to thee we crost those seas,</L>
<L>Whose rage scarce summer tames, a tempest rose,</L>
<L>A dreadful one, as ever swept the main.</L>
<L>All night we labour'd in the jaws of death.</L>
<L>But, when the morning dawn'd, the tempest ceas'd;</L>
<L>Red, on the troubled deep, the sun arose,</L>
<L>And shew'd a dismal object to our eyes;</L>
<L>Fast, on a ridge of rocks, a wreck appear'd,</L>
<L>Which seem'd the ruin of a noble vessel;</L>
<L>Near as our safety would permit we sail'd,</L>
<L>And view'd the fate, which might have been our own.—</L>
<L>The ship was broken, by the heavy seas</L>

<L>No, not one,</L>
<L>Low are the rocks; their ragged tops are seen,</L>

<L>But in a storm their place is known afar,</L>

<L>It was. About to leave</L>

<L>By which they might be known, that sword we spied,</L>
<L>Caught in the cordage of a mast it hung</L>
<L>And glitter'd through the water.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIVINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis enough!</L>
<L>If at my feet his breathless body lay,</L>
<L>I could not be more certain of his fate.</L>
<L>In those wild waves the chief of warriors died;</L>
<L>To me he hasten'd through the seas and storms;</L>
<L>Unknowing of his wrongs for me he died.</L>

<L>I hold the sword of Ronan. Who he was,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="23"/>And of what high renown, is not unknown;</L>
<L>For thro' the kingdoms of the North his name</L>
<L>Flew on the wings of Fame.—His love to me</L>
<L>And mine to him, for I avow my love,</L>
<L>My sire approv'd.—To him I was betroth'd,</L>
<L>But in his absence, Durstan did seduce,</L>
<L>A faithless servant to betray his master.</L>
<L>He fram'd a message from the noble Ronan,</L>
<L>Rejecting me, and setting free my faith;</L>
<L>Then urg'd a fond exasperated maid,</L>
<L>And with the help of her deceived father,</L>
<L>Precipitated her disorder'd mind,</L>
<L>To yield a rash consent.—That was my crime,</L>
<L>Which I deny not; nor refuse to bear</L>
<L>My punishment, which, like my crime, is great.</L>
<L>Despair consumes me! wither'd like the leaf</L>

<SPEAKER>ORELLAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>My story's old,</L>
<L>Thy sorrow recent: but to hear my woes</L>
<L>Will teach thee patience. Such as thou art now,</L>
<L>Or as thou wast, e'er grief had made thee wan,</L>
<L>Namora was. Like thine, her beauty charm'd</L>
<L>Contending princes; but the generous maid</L>
<L>Preferr'd to princes fond Orellan's love.</L>
<L>Daily we met in woods, in groves, in glades,</L>
<L>Remote and secret. One unhappy time,</L>
<L>Returning from the chace, I sought the grove.</L>
<L>Ent'ring, I saw Namora; her white arms</L>
<L>Embrac'd a youth; her lips were join'd to his.</L>
<L>My bow was in my hand; I bent it soon,</L>
<L>And pierc'd them with one arrow. Ere I reach'd</L>
<L>The spot on which they fell, Namora's eyes</L>
<L>Were clos'd for ever. The expiring youth</L>
<L>Was her brave brother, to his native shore</L>
<L>That day return'd. His sister's steps he trac'd,</L>
<L>To perish in her arms. I kneel'd me down,</L>
<L>And begg'd the warrior, if he yet had strength,</L>
<L>To give me death. He heard me not, he died,</L>
<L>And left me living.—This bleak cave I chose,</L>
<L>My everlasting mansion. In those days</L>
<L>The hollow shore resounded with my cries.</L>
<L>Often the hunter hasten'd from the hill,</L>
<L>And oft the mariner steer'd from the deep,</L>
<L>And wonder'd at me. Time, that rage subdued</L>
<L>To milder grief. My tears incessant flow'd</L>
<L>Like waters from the rock. Here have I mourn'd</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="33"/>An age of man compleat. Alike to me</L>
<L>Summer and winter, autumn an the spring,</L>

<L>Thus would I wish</L>
<L>To waste my days, a spectacle of woe!</L>
<L>Without or change or interval. I feel</L>
<L>Within myself a source and spring of sorrow,</L>
<L>That ne'er will cease to flow, 'till death shall stop it.</L>
<L>Surely the spirits of the dead delight</L>
<L>To be remember'd, and lamented, father.</L>

<L>Daughter, they do—my own experience tells.—</L>
<L>Once every year, that day Namora died,</L>
<L>A wondrous vision comes. In the still air</L>
<L>(For not a breath then stirs the silent bay)</L>
<L>Are heard the saddest, yet the sweetest sounds,</L>
<L>That ever touch'd the ear or heart of man,</L>
<L>The melody of woe.—Then from the skies</L>
<L>Descend the shadows of the murder'd pair,</L>
<L>Pale as the colours of the lunar bow.</L>
<L>Hov'ring before the cavern's mouth they spread</L>
<L>Their arms; they fix on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their pitying eyes,</L>

<SPEAKER>CONNAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>MY friend is dead. But friendship never dies.</L>
<L>Remember, Sir, how Ronan fought for me.</L>
<L>The youth were met in the sequester'd vale,</L>
<L>And held a feast of joy. The bards arose,</L>
<L>And sung heroic deeds atchiev'd of old.</L>
<L>Rous'd with the song the chiefs began to boast</L>
<L>Their own exploits in arms. Above the rest</L>
<L>Proud Armor vaunted, trusting in his strength;</L>
<L>Truth he regarded not; he told how once,</L>
<L>In Ardven's vale he met the blue-ey'd maid,</L>
<L>Old Alpine's daughter; Connan was her guard,</L>
<L>Who shun'd the combat, and resign'd the maid.</L>
<L>Silent and pale my sad companions heard;</L>
<L>But from the banquet generous Ronan rose,</L>
<L>And dar'd the giant to maintain his words,</L>
<L>By combat on the plain. Furious they met,</L>
<L>Like two strong bulls contending for the herd;</L>
<L>They fought from mid-day 'till the setting sun</L>
<L>Gilded the vale; then Ronan's arm prevail'd,</L>
<L>And Armor bit the ground. Fast by the lake,</L>
<L>Mark'd with a stone, is seen his lengthen'd grave;</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="48"/>Eternal monument of Ronan's faith</L>
<L>And of his glory; but of shame to me,</L>
<L>If e'er my soul forgets the hero's love.</L>

<SPEAKER>KATHUL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! who comes yonder rushing from the wood,</L>

<SPEAKER>KATHUL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oft have I heard the voice of mournful ghosts,</L>
<L>Borne on the wings of the careering winds,</L>

<L>I trust 'twill prosper in thy stedfast hand.</L>

<L>Nor in rash mood forsake thine antient friends.</L>
<L>Oh! friend of Ronan! be the peoples friend.</L>
<L>Still let thy open gate receive the stranger,</L>
<L>Who from the hill or from the ship descends,</L>
<L>So shall thy name like grateful odour spread</L>
<L>From thy own dwelling to far distant lands.</L>

<L>With fair Rivine, in the house of death.</L>
<L>If right my soul forebodes they shall not lie</L>
<L>In dark oblivion; on their buried woes</L>
<L>The light refulgent of the song shall rise</L>
<L>And brighten the sad tale to future times.</L>
<L>The brave, the fair shall give the pleasing tear</L>

<L><HI>I know not what to do, or what to say.</HI></L>
<L>Our bard, a strange unfashionable creature,</L>

<L>Will have no Epilogue!—I told the brute—</L>
<L>If Sir, these trifles don't <HI>your</HI> genius suit;</L>
<L>We have a working Prologue-smith, within,</L>
