<P>ARABERT, a young ecclesiastic, retired to the convent of <HI>La Trappe,</HI> in obedience to a vow he had taken during a fit of illness: LEONORA, with whom he had lived in the strictest intimacy, followed her lover, and by the means of a disguise, obtained admission into the monastery, where a few days after she assisted at her lover's funeral.</P>

<HEAD>THE FUNERAL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAIR LEONORA, by affliction led,</L>
<L>Sought the dread dome where sleep the hallow'd dead:</L>
<L>The solemn edifice was wrapt around,</L>
<L>In midnight darkness, and in peace profound:</L>
<L>A solitary lamp, with languid light, <MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Serv'd not to chase, but to disclose the night:</L>
<L>Serv'd to disclose (of all her grief the source,)</L>
<L>The tomb that gap'd for ARABERTUS' corse:</L>
<L>To this, she sent the deep, the frequent sigh,</L>
<L>And spoke—the tear just gath'ring in her eye. <MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>'Doom'd to receive all that my soul holds dear,</L>
<L>'Give him that rest his heart refus'd him here:</L>
<L>'Oh screen him from the pain the tender know,</L>
<L>'The train of sorrows that from passion flow;</L>
<L>'And to his envied new-born state adjoin, <MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>'(Or all is vain) an ignorance of mine.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thus she mourn'd, an aged priest drew near,</L>
<L>(Whose pure life glided as the riv'let clear,)</L>
<L>The virtuous ANSELM.—Tho' in cloisters bred,</L>
<L>Still bright-ey'd Wisdom to his cell he led: <MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>From paths of sophistry he lov'd to stray,</L>
<L>To tread the walk where Nature led the way.</L>
<L>The prior's rank he long had held approv'd,</L>
<L>Esteem'd, rever'd, and as a parent lov'd:</L>
<L>Unskilful in the jargon of the schools, <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>He knew humanity's diviner rules:</L>
<L>To others gentle, to himself severe,</L>
<L>On sorrow's wound he dropt the healing tear.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>In all the negligence of grief he found,</L>
<L>The fair extended on the naked ground. <MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Touch'd at her woe the sacred father said,</L>
<L>'Well may'st thou droop if happiness be fled:</L>
<L>'Sure, if at holy ARABERT'S decease,</L>
<L>'Impetuous sorrows rush upon thy peace,</L>
<L>'Some much-lov'd friend in him you must deplore, <MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>'Or, dearer still, a brother is no more:</L>
<L>'Yet, as thro' life our weary steps we bend,</L>
<L>'Let us not sink when beating storms descend:</L>
<L>'Still let Religion hold unrival'd sway,</L>
<L>'And Patience walk companion of our way. <MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>'Ah, lose not sight of that delightful shore,</L>
<L>'Whose blissful bow'rs shall friends to friends restore:</L>
<L>'Tho' here misfortune comes to blast our will,</L>
<L>'The Heav'ns are just, and God a Father still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Blest be the voice, the rising mourner said, <MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>'That bids Affliction raise her drooping head:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>'That bids me hope (beyond ev'n Death's domain,)</L>
<L>'These eyes shall banquet on my love again.</L>
<L>'Ah, start not ANSELM—for to truth allied,</L>
<L>'Impiety now throws her mask aside: <MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>'No holy monk by contemplation led,</L>
<L>'To these sequestered mansions of the dead;</L>
<L>'No youth devoted to Religion's pow'r,</L>
<L>'Implores thy pity at this awful hour.—</L>
<L>'The guilty secret—I'll at length unfold— <MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>'In me—(forgive) a woman you behold.</L>
<L>'Ah fly me not, let mercy now prevail,</L>
<L>'And deign to mark my sad disastrous tale.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Known to misfortune from my tender years,</L>
<L>'My parent's ashes drank my early tears: <MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>'A barb'rous uncle to each vice allied,</L>
<L>'The office of a parent ill supplied:</L>
<L>'Of my entire inheritance possess'd,</L>
<L>'By lucre prompted, and by fortune blest,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>'He pass'd the ocean never to return, <MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>'And left me weeping o'er my parents' urn:</L>
<L>'Then ARABERT the gen'rous stranger came,</L>
<L>'To sooth my sorrows, and relieve my shame:</L>
<L>'Beneath his tender care, my woes decreas'd,</L>
<L>'More than Religion's, he was Pity's priest: <MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>'To reach his bounty my affection strove,</L>
<L>'Till gratitude was heighten'd into love:</L>
<L>'Nor he at length refus'd the lover's part,</L>
<L>'The pity that adorn'd, betray'd his heart.</L>
<L>'How ardently he wish'd the nuptial rite, <MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>'In holy wedlock, might our hands unite:</L>
<L>'But stern Religion at our vows exclaim'd,</L>
<L>'And tore the bands that Love and Nature fram'd:</L>
<L>'For then devoted to her hallow'd shrine,</L>
<L>'His country's laws forbad him to be mine. <MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>'Tho' from my mind each flatt'ring thought retir'd,</L>
<L>'And in my bosom, hope and peace expir'd;</L>
<L>'Yet on their ruins, love triumphant rose:</L>
<L>'Enough—shame o'er the rest a mantle throws:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>'At length Remorse effaced the guilty scene, <MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>'And to his breast apply'd her dagger keen;</L>
<L>'Restrain'd in full career the erring youth,</L>
<L>'And led him back to Innocence and Truth:</L>
<L>' 'Twas then he fled from Pleasure's rosy bow'rs,</L>
<L>'To woo Religion in these gloomy tow'rs: <MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>'Yet are he fled, my bliss he fondly plann'd,</L>
<L>'And scatter'd riches with a lavish hand:</L>
<L>'Ah, what to me avail'd the golden store?</L>
<L>'The giver gone, the gift cou'd charm no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'While in the gloom his tedious absence cast, <MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>'My former life in fancy I repass'd,</L>
<L>'Repentance gain'd admission to my breast,</L>
<L>'Nor did it enter an unwelcome guest:</L>
<L>'For ne'er to Pleasure I dismiss'd the rein</L>
<L>'Free and unconscious of reflection's pain; <MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>'If hapless LEONORA lov'd too well,</L>
<L>'Content, fair Virtue's friend, with Virtue fell:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>'But not my stubborn soul cou'd pray'r subdue,</L>
<L>'Ev'n grafted on remorse my passion grew;</L>
<L>'Too fatal passion—by its impulse led, <MILESTONE N="101"/></L>
<L>'In man's attire to this retreat I fled:</L>
<L>'Yet then, ev'n then to bashful fear allied,</L>
<L>'Still o'er my love did modesty preside.</L>
<L>'In those sweet moments that precede the night,</L>
<L>'When peaceful Nature wears a soften'd light, <MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>'I met the youth within the solemn grove,</L>
<L>'(His frequent walk) absorb'd in heav'nly love:</L>
<L>'I strove to speak, but words refus'd to flow,</L>
<L>'And, fix'd, I stood a monument of woe:</L>
<L>'While God and he employ the trembling scene, <MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>' 'Twere sacrilege, I thought, to rush between:</L>
<L>'Still from that hour my wishes I restrain'd,</L>
<L>'And in my breast th' unwilling secret chain'd:</L>
<L>'Unknown to him, yet half-content I grew,</L>
<L>'So that his form might daily charm my view: <MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>'Think how misguided by your guileless heart,</L>
<L>'You took for virtue, what in me was art,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>'And highly honor'd with applauding strain,</L>
<L>'The zeal that join'd Religion's sober strain,</L>
<L>'Unknowing that the call thou did'st approve, <MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>'And all my virtue, all my zeal was love:</L>
<L>'But new Affiction, with relentless hand,</L>
<L>'O'erthrew the project that my heart had plann'd:</L>
<L>'Amid the horrors of the lonesome night,</L>
<L>'A ghastly spectre rush'd upon my sight, <MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>'And pour'd these accents on my trembling ear,'</L>
<L><HI>Think not impiety shall triumph here</HI>:</L>
<L><HI>Thy hopes are blasted—Death's tremendous bell</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall sound, ere many hours, thy lover's knell:</HI></L>
<L>'I started from my couch, with fright impress'd, <MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L>'And anxious doubts were busy in my breast:</L>
<L>'By love then prompted—yet by love dismay'd,</L>
<L>'The peopled choir I tremblingly survey'd;</L>
<L>'Still mid th' innumerous monastic train,</L>
<L>'These eyes solicited his form in vain: <MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>'Nor in the field or pensive grove retir'd,</L>
<L>'Could I discover whom my heart requir'd:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>'Then sure (I cried) at this unhappy hour <MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
<L>'Does anguish o'er his cell diffuse its pow'r:</L>
<L>'Shall LEONORA not relieve his pain,</L>
<L>'And with these arms his drooping head fustain?</L>
<L>'Say, at the couch, when death is stalking round,</L>
<L>'Shall not the spouse of his fond heart be found! <MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
<L>'Ah no—th' affection that subdues me still,</L>
<L>'At that dread moment check'd my ardent will,</L>
<L>'Lest rushing on his sight I should control</L>
<L>'The holy thoughts that hover'd o'er his soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'This low'ring morn disclos'd the fatal truth: <MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>'Oh early lost—oh lov'd—oh hapless youth—</L>
<L>'Fix'd to the column of the hallow'd porch—</L>
<L>' 'Twas scarcely light—some fury lent her torch—</L>
<L>'I read—</L>
<L><HI>The pious</HI> ARABERT'<HI>s no more,</HI> <MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L><HI>The peace the dead require, for him implore:</HI></L>
<L>'Let peace, let joy, (I said) his spirit join,</L>
<L>'Nor joy, nor peace must e'er encircle mine:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>'Lamented youth! too tenderly allied,</L>
<L>'In vain you fled me, and in vain you died, <MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>'Still to your image, which this breast inurns,</L>
<L>'My constant heart a lamp perpetual burns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'But thou, to whom as friend he did impart</L>
<L>'Each latent wish, and foible of the heart;</L>
<L>'For well I know, where Sorrow drops her tear, <MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>'Or Misery complains, thou still art near;</L>
<L>'Ah say, by love did my idea drest,</L>
<L>'Come to his mind thus welcome, thus carest?</L>
<L>'Or on his soul come rushing undesir'd</L>
<L>'The fatal fair, by female arts inspir'd, <MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>'Who dimm'd the lustre of his radiant name,</L>
<L>'And from his temples tore the flow'r of fame:</L>
<L>'Who thro' the labyrinth of Pleasure's bow'r</L>
<L>'Allur'd (for beauty such as mine had pow'r)</L>
<L>'Ev'n to the dang'rous fteep—and cast him down <MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>'From high repute to grov'ling disrenown:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>'Wretch that I am, to my distressful state</L>
<L>'There wanted not th' addition of his hate:</L>
<L>'For him I plung'd my artless youth in shame,</L>
<L>'Unlock'd reserve, and sacrificed my fame: <MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>'Still, still I fear (unable to confide,)</L>
<L>'Before my ARABERT, the lover died:</L>
<L>'This thought (to thee I'll own) suspends my grief,</L>
<L>'While cold indifference c mes to my relief:</L>
<L>'Say virtuous ANSELM, if this thought be vain, <MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>'And give, Oh give me all my grief again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To her replied the pity-breathing seer,</L>
<L>'Mark well my words, and lose thy idle fear:</L>
<L>'When on the couch of Death, the victim lay,</L>
<L>'Not in that moment was his friend away: <MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>'As at his side I took my mournful stand,</L>
<L>'With feeble grasp he seiz'd my offer'd hand,</L>
<L>'And thus began.—"The fatal dart is sped,</L>
<L>"Soon, soon shall ARABERT encrease the dead:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>" 'Tis well—for what can added life bestow, <MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>"But days returning still with added woe:</L>
<L>"Say, have I not secluded from my sight,</L>
<L>"The lovely object of my past delight?</L>
<L>"Ah, had I too dethron'd her from my mind,</L>
<L>"When here the holy brotherhood I join'd, <MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>"Remorse wou'd not, encreafing my disease,</L>
<L>"Prey on my soul, and rob it of its ease:</L>
<L>"And yet I strove unequal to the part,</L>
<L>"Weak to perform the sacrifice of heart:</L>
<L>"And now, ev'n now, too feeble to control, <MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>"I feel her clinging to my parting soul:"</L>
<L>"He spoke—(my sympathetic bosom bled,)</L>
<L>"And to the realms of Death his spirit fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fair rejoin'd: 'Misled by foul distrust,</L>
<L>'To him, whose heart was mine, am I unjust? <MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>'Ah, ARABERT, th' unwilling fault forgive,</L>
<L>'Dead to th'alluring world, in thee I live:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>'My thoughts, my deep regret, my sorrows own,</L>

<L>'At all the vengeance bursting from above, <MILESTONE N="215"/></L>
<L>'Alarm'd, I weep, I shudder, yet I love:'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thus she spoke, the death-bell smote her ear,</L>
<L>While to the porch the fun'ral train drew near:</L>
<L>Ah, LEONORE in that tremendous hour,</L>
<L>Did'st thou not feel all Heav'n's avenging pow'r, <MILESTONE N="220"/></L>
<L>When moving thro' the isle, the choral band,</L>
<L>And vested priests, with torches in their hand,</L>

<L>Thy lover sleeping on th' untimely bier?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Collecting now at length her scatter'd force, <MILESTONE N="225"/></L>
<L>With trembling footsteps she approach'd the corse,</L>
<L>And while she check'd the conflict in her breast,</L>
<L>The wide-encircling throng she thus address'd:</L>
<L>'Well may ye mark me with astonish'd eyes,</L>

<L>'Yet still shou'd Pity in your breast abide, <MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>'And Pity sure to Virtue is allied:</L>
<L>'To my distress benign attention lend,</L>
<L>'Your acts of rigor for a while suspend,</L>
<L>'Till o'er this bier ('tis Nature's kind relief,)</L>

<LG>
<L>'Thou who didst place us in this vale of tears,</L>
<L>'Where sorrow blasts the plant that pleasure rears:</L>
<L>'If, as the tenets of our creed require, <MILESTONE N="245"/></L>

<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>'Ah not o'er ARABERT thy vengeance spread!</L>
<L>'On me, on me t y darts of anger shed! <MILESTONE N="250"/></L>
<L>'For I allur'd him far from Virtue's way,</L>
<L>'And led his youthful innocence astray:</L>
<L>'Ah not in punishment our fate conjoin,</L>
<L>'He shar'd the rapture, but the guilt was mine.'</L>

<LG>
<L>With trembling hand she now the veil withdrew, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis usual to bury the monks of La Trappe in their monastic 01 habit extended on a plank.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="255"/></L>
<L>When lo the well-known features struck her view:</L>
<L>Absorpt in grief she cast a fond survey—</L>
<L>At length her thoughts in murmurs broke away:</L>
<L>'That eye—which shed on mine voluptuous light,</L>
<L>'Alas how sunk in everlasting night? <MILESTONE N="260"/></L>
<L>'See from those lips the living colour fled,</L>

<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>'On that cold lip sure LEONORE may dwell,</L>
<L>'And, free from guilt, imprint the long farewell:'</L>

<L>Three times the mourner kiss'd th' unconscious dead. <MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now holy ANSELM urg'd her to restrain</L>
<L>Her boundless grief in rev'rence of the fane:</L>
<L>She answer'd, starting from the sable bier,</L>
<L>'Can I forget that ARABERT was dear!</L>
<L>'Can I, cold monitor, from hence remove, <MILESTONE N="275"/></L>

<L>'All unsolicited he gave me wealth,</L>
<L>'He gave me solace, and he gave me health;</L>
<L>'And, dearer than the bliss those gifts impart,</L>

<L>'Can sorrow sleep, and gratitude be dumb?</L>
<L>'But I submit—and bend thus meekly low,</L>
