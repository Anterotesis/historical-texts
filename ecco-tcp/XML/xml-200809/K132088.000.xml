<HEAD>THE RIOT; OR, HALF A LOAF IS BETTER THAN NO BREAD. IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN JACK ANVIL AND TOM HOD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Tune of <HI>"A Cobler there was," &amp;c.</HI></OPENER>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>COME, neighbours, no longer be patient and quiet</L>
<L>Come let us go kick up a bit of a riot;</L>
<L>I am hungry, my lads, but I've little to eat,</L>
<L>So we'll pull down the mills, and seize all the meat:</L>
<L>I'll give you good sport, boys, as ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saw,</L>
<L>So a fig for the Justice, a fig for the law.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<LG>
<L>Then his pitchfork Tom seiz'd—hold a moment says Jack,</L>
<L>I'll shew thee thy blunder, brave boy, in a crack.</L>
<L>And if I don't prove we had better be still,</L>
<L>I'll assist thee straitway to pull down every mill;</L>
<L>I'll shew thee how passion thy reason does cheat,</L>
<L>Or I'll join thee in plunder for bread and for meat.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What a whimsey to think thus our bellies to fill,</L>
<L>For we stop all the grinding by breaking the mill?</L>
<L>What a whimsey to think we shall get more to eat</L>
<L>By abusing the butchers who get us the meat!</L>
<L>What a whimsey to think we shall mend our spare diet</L>
<L>By breeding disturbance, by murder and riot!</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Because I am dry, 'twould be foolish, I think</L>
<L>To pull out my tap and to spill all my drink;</L>
<L>Because I am hungry and want to be fed.</L>
<L>That is sure no wise reason for wasting my bread;</L>
<L>And just such wise reasons for mending their diet</L>
<L>Are us'd by those blockheads who rush into riot.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I would not take comfort from others distresses,</L>
<L>But still I would mark how God our land blesses;</L>
<L>For tho' in Old England the times are but sad,</L>
<L>Abroad I am told they are ten times as bad;</L>
<L>In the land of the Pope there is scarce any grain,</L>
<L>And 'tis still worse, they say, both in Holland and Spain.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let us look to the harvest our wants to beguile,</L>
<L>See the lands with rich crops how they every where smile!</L>
<L>Mean time to assist us, by each Western breeze,</L>
<L>Some corn is brought daily across the salt seas,</L>
<L>We'll drink little tea, no whisky at all,</L>
<L>But patiently wait, and the prices will fall.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, if we're not quiet, then let us not wonder</L>
<L>If things grow much worse by our riot and plunder;</L>
<L>And let us remember, whenever we meet,</L>
<L>The more ale we drink, boys, the less we shall eat.</L>
<L>On those days spent in riot, <HI>no</HI> bread you brought home,</L>
<L>Had you spent them in labour you must have had <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A dinner of herbs, says the wise man, with quiet</L>
<L>Is better than beef amid discord and riot.</L>
<L>If the thing can't be help'd, I'm a foe to all strife,</L>
<L>And pray for a peace every night of my life;</L>
<L>But in matters of state not an inch will I budge,</L>
<L>Because I conceive I'm no very good judge.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But tho' poor, I can work, my brave boys, with the best,</L>
<L>Let the King and the Parliament manage the rest;</L>
<L>I lament both the War and the Taxes together,</L>
<L>Tho' I verily think they don't alter the weather.</L>
<L>The King, as I take it with very good reason,</L>
<L>May prevent a bad law, but can't help a bad season.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Parliament-men, altho' great is their power,</L>
<L>Yet they cannot contrive us a bit of a shower;</L>
<L>And I never yet heard, tho' our Rulers are wise;</L>
<L>That they know very well how to manage the skies;</L>
<L>For the best of them all, as they found to their cost,</L>
<L>Were not able to hinder last Winter's hard frost.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Besides, I must share in the wants of the times,</L>
<L>Because I have had my full share in it's crimes;</L>
<L>And I'm apt to believe the distress which is sent,</L>
<L>Is to punish and cure us of all discontent.</L>
<L>—But harvest is coming—Potatoes will come!</L>
<L>Our prospect clears up; Ye complainers be dumb!</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tho' I've no money, and tho' I've no lands,</L>
<L>I've a head on my shoulders, and a pair of good hands;</L>
<L>So I'll work the whole day, and on Sundays I'll seek</L>
<L>At church how to bear all the wants of the week.</L>
<L>The Gentlefolks too will afford us supplies;</L>
<L>They'll subscribe—and they'll give up their puddings and pies.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then before I'm induced to take part in a Riot,</L>
<L>I'll ask this short question—What shall I get by it?</L>
<L>So I'll e'en wait a little till cheaper the bread,</L>
<L>For a mittimus hangs o'er each Rieters head;</L>
<L>And when of two evils I'm ask'd which is best,</L>
<L>I'd rather be hungry than be hang'd, I protest.</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth Tom, thou art right: If I rise, I'm a Turk,</L>
<L>So he threw down his pitchfork, and went to his work.</L>
