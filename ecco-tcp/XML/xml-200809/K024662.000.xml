<P>IN endeavouring to display the good and bad effects occasioned by Enthu∣siasm, I might have drawn many signal instances from that inexhaustible mine, the Greek and Roman story; but it appeared to me more eligible to work upon materials hewn from the modern quarry only: the subject, thus treated, I conceived would come more home to the feelings of the reader. With regard to the execution, that rests entirely on the judgment of the

<L>Weed from the feeling heart the rising sigh,</L>

<L>Amid this scene th' accusing Angel rose,</L>
<L>On his stern brow bold indignation glows;</L>
<L>Some troubling vision, with disaster fraught,</L>

<L>Th' Enthusiast, hast'ning thro' the regal porch,</L>
<L>Waves in the eye of day a raging torch:</L>

<L>So the fond mother-bird, alarm'd, distrest,</L>

<L>And bears away the music of the shades.</L>

<L>SEE to the dome (thro' many an age rever'd)</L>
<L>The star-illumin'd dome which science rear'd,</L>

<L>Alluring apologues address'd to youth,</L>
<L>Pure maxims moulded in the breast of truth,</L>
<L>Which from the holy lips of sages breath'd,</L>
<L>Rich moral legacies to man bequeath'd:</L>

<L>Ah, now they yield, they fall with deaf'ning sound,</L>
<L>And in tumultuous havoc spread around!</L>
<L>At length, descending like a low-hung cloud,</L>
<L>Oblivion o'er the waste expands her shroud,</L>
<L>Beneath whose dark'ning canopy is cast</L>
<L>The fond remembrance of transactions past:</L>
<L>Of youthful warriors, who, by glory led,</L>

<L>To ratify the terrible command:</L>
<L>O hapless, lost, exterminated race,</L>
<L>What can atone this unprovok'd disgrace?</L>
<L>Ye venerable men with silver hair,</L>

<L>Ye meet the thunders of the rushing storms,</L>

<L>'While here I languish on affliction's bed,</L>

<L>And whisper comfort to the soul of grief?</L>

<L>'What dire conception has thy bosom fram'd?</L>
<L>O death-importing scenery! sight abhorr'd!</L>
<L>Whence this attire, this ignominious cord?</L>
<L>Impell'd by frenzy whither dost thou tend?</L>
<L>Relent, relent, thine impious steps suspend!'—</L>
<L>With a calm fortitude the chieftain said,</L>
<L>'The path that climbs to honor's height I tread:</L>
<L>These joyful loud acclaims that rend the air</L>
<L>Wouldst thou convert to howlings of despair?</L>
<L>Ev'n love commands—with eager step I go</L>
<L>To shield JOANNA from impending woe.'</L>
<L>'What peace,' she answers, 'can I thence derive?</L>
<L>The lover murder'd, say can joy survive?</L>
<L>While famine, sickness, terrors I endur'd,</L>
<L>Was this the future bliss that hope assur'd?</L>
<L>To length'ning care, to sorrow still allied,</L>
<L>Behold JOANNA stands Misfortune's bride:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="25"/>What time her flush'd expectancies drew near,</L>
<L>She meets her bridegroom on the hopeless bier.</L>
<L>Had Mercy, heav'n-descending Mercy stole</L>
<L>Her gentle radiance o'er the conq'ror's soul,</L>
<L>This day, escap'd from wide affliction's wreck,</L>
<L>This day might I, reclining on thy neck,</L>
<L>Have utter'd EDWARD's praise—that thought is flown,</L>
<L>And each fond project of my heart o'erthrown.</L>
<L>When from thy wound I drew the British dart,</L>
<L>And with these lips embalm'd th' envenom'd part,</L>
<L>Would that the poison like a subtile flame</L>
<L>Had scorch'd my entrails, and dissolv'd my frame!'</L>
<L>She ceas'd—her eye emits a weaker glance,</L>
<L>While her dim reason fades into a trance:</L>
<L>The youth, as if indignant of delay,</L>
<L>Drops her pale hand, and turns abrupt away:</L>
<L>Then to the partners of his fate he cried,</L>
<L>'Ye willing victims, to my soul allied,</L>
<L>Forgive, if passion's all-subduing pow'r</L>
<L>Dare to profane this high important hour;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="26"/>Now, free of weakness, clear of love's controul,</L>
<L>I lead the way that runs to virtue's goal.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ARRIV'D at EDWARD's tent, the dauntless youth</L>
<L>Resum'd—'Invested in this garb uncouth,</L>
<L>If, at thy bidding, thus we meet thine eye,</L>
<L>For grace (the coward's hope) we heave no sigh:</L>
<L>Since acts of slaughter are thy soul's best food,</L>
<L>O gorge thy rav'ning appetite of blood!'—</L>
<L>Now with the glowing youths, of equal mind,</L>
<L>In one resolve, one hope, one peril join'd,</L>
<L>He stands, unaw'd by death, sublimely great,</L>
<L>True to his cause, rejoicing in his fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT other scenes of high illustrious fame</L>
<L>Burst on my soul, impatient of their claim:</L>
<L>Behold! th' Enthusiast, freedom to regain,</L>
<L>Leads her stern Barons o'er the sacred plain;</L>
<L>'Tis glory's chase! how eagerly they speed</L>
<L>O'er the fam'd ransom-ground of RUNNYMEDE!</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="27"/>To the proud Monarch daring they complain—</L>
<L>'Say, hast thou not polluted ALBION's fane,</L>
<L>And plunder'd thence, with sacrilegious stealth,</L>
<L>The brightest gem, our pride, our better wealth.</L>
<L>Fair Freedom's heav'nly form? Of her bereft,</L>
<L>Life is a burden, not an envied gift.</L>
<L>The bending seer, with sorrow's weight opprest.</L>
<L>Who beats in his despair his wither'd breast,</L>
<L>Shall sooner from his tortur'd mind efface</L>
<L>The wretch who plung'd his daughter in disgrace,</L>
<L>Who in his sight compell'd her to his arms,</L>
<L>And rudely ravish'd her untasted charms,</L>
<L>Than we forgive thy violating pow'r,</L>
<L>That wrested Freedom from her native bow'r:</L>
<L>Licentious Monarch, thy approaching hand</L>
<L>Profanes the ark, and desecrates the land!'</L>
<L>They spoke—each battle-axe, now rear'd on high,</L>
<L>(Catching the splendor of th' unclouded sky)</L>
<L>Cast on th' illumin'd field a sudden light,</L>
<L>Whose rapid flash o'erpower'd the monarch's sight:</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="28"/>Upbraiding thoughts his wav'ring mind assail'd,</L>
<L>And fear, the tyrant's curse, his aspect pal'd:</L>
<L>At length he seals, with mean, reluctant soul,</L>
<L>(To BRITAIN ever dear) th' immortal scroll.</L>
<L>Hail, welcome instance of submitting pow'r,</L>
<L>Hail, holy Freedom's sacramental hour,</L>
<L>In which that offspring of indulgent Heav'n</L>
<L>Was with dread pomp to ENGLAND's sons regiv'n.</L>
<L>Now thro' disclosing skies th' angelic train</L>
<L>Pour on th' enraptur'd ear the choral strain,</L>
<L>'Be cheerful praise, be salutations paid,</L>
<L>'And hymns symphonious, to the godlike Maid,</L>
<L>'Whose energy resists the tyrant's plan:</L>
<L>'Joy be to Saints, and liberty to Man!'—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FROM Time's dark gulph, revolving back to light,</L>
<L>What new-born image rushes on my sight?</L>
<L>The bold COLUMBUS dedicates his sail</L>
<L>To the wild breathing of a stranger gale:</L>
<L>Th' Enthusiast bids his dauntless soul explore</L>
<L>Realms unreveal'd, and seas unplough'd before:</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="29"/>The hour now ripening in the womb of time,</L>
<L>Th' inspir'd adventurer reach'd the point sublime,</L>
<L>The long-obscuring veil for him was furl'd.</L>
<L>And on his vision burst another world!</L>
<L>Ecstatic Wonder heard the proud event,</L>
<L>And o'er the ocean the glad tidings sent:</L>
<L>Then Industry, as by electric stroke,</L>
<L>From her enduring sleep instinctive broke:</L>
<L>With brightest omens of her future reign,</L>
<L>This better VENUS rising from the main,</L>
<L>Saw from all harbours, rushing with the tide,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd vessels at her beck'ning glide:</L>
<L>Did it not seem as if the sever'd earth,</L>
<L>Like two fair sisters parted from their birth,</L>
<L>Acknowledging at length their kindred race,</L>
<L>Felt the warm transport of a first embrace?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW the same age a different scene presents,</L>
<L>And the bold vision labours with events:</L>
<L>Methinks I see, extending wide around,</L>
<L>A tow'ring wood with crowding leaves imbrown'd;</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="30"/>Beneath whose vast display of deadly shade</L>
<L>Her listless length lethargic EUROPE laid:</L>
<L>There Superstition her deep plan design'd</L>
<L>Against the awful sanctuary of the mind:</L>
<L>There the wan sorceress, haggard fiend of hell,</L>
<L>Midst her dim orgies mutter'd the dread spell.</L>
<L>The sun abhors to pour his radiant flood</L>
<L>O'er the dumb horror of the slumb'ring wood;</L>
<L>Yet thro' the gloom of sacerdotal night</L>
<L>One peerless star reveals a cheerful light:</L>
<L>Ah! why in mystic strains eclipse his name?</L>
<L>Demand, O LUTHER, thine unbounded fame:</L>
<L>Advance, advance, thou elder son of Truth,</L>
<L>Sublime, all-daring, restless, ardent youth!</L>
<L>I now behold th' enthusiastic Maid</L>
<L>Rushing impetuous to her fav'rite's aid:</L>
<L>She reaches to his lips a cup of fire,</L>
<L>Whose living drops the leaping pulse inspire,</L>
<L>O'er each thrill'd artery entracing roll,</L>
<L>And sublimate the high-aspiring soul.</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="31"/>Revealing now his mission from the skies,</L>
<L>He utters to the torpid world—'Arise!'</L>
<L>The sullen forest, wrapt in tenfold night,</L>
<L>Swift thro' a thousand vistas drinks the light:</L>
<L>Th' imprison'd tenants burst the mental tomb,</L>
<L>While from their eyes recedes the massive gloom:</L>
<L>The flaky clouds admit an orient ray,</L>
<L>And laughing morn unlocks the gates of day.</L>
<L>Prompt Apprehension sends her view around,</L>
<L>While her bold thoughts o'erleap their former bound,</L>
<L>And Joy proclaims throughout th' applauding earth.</L>
<L>The hallow'd festival of Reason's birth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW the couch'd mind reveals its spotless eye,</L>
<L>Weak to sustain the splendor of the sky,</L>
<L>Till strength'ning at th' irradiating gleam,</L>
<L>It meets unblenching Truth's refulgent beam:</L>
<L>So when the keenly-glitt'ring darts of light</L>
<L>Pierce the loose film that dims the eaglet's sight,</L>
<L>First with an ignorant and coy survey</L>
<L>The dazzled bird admires the stranger day,</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="32"/>Then glancing on the sun with tow'ring gaze,</L>
<L>Kindles his vision at the noon-tide blaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW Science hears a voice unknown before—</L>
<L>'Haste, pilot, pilot quit the drowsy shore;</L>
<L>The fav'ring winds thy destin'd hour proclaim,</L>
<L>Display thy sails, and launch into thy fame.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MEEK Toleration, heav'n-descending maid,</L>
<L>A vernal rainbow glitt'ring o'er her head,</L>
<L>Smooths the rough path destructive feet have trac'd,</L>
<L>Adorns and peoples Persecution's waste:</L>
<L>She, like the FLORA of the Pagan reign,</L>
<L>Sprinkles with roses the enamell'd plain,</L>
<L>Bids ev'ry flow'r of ev'ry clime arise,</L>
<L>And freely breathe its incense to the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SEE Superstition, madd'ning at th' alarm,</L>
<L>Extend in thunder cloath'd her threat'ning arm,</L>
<L>But with'ring at the heart she rues the hour</L>
<L>That harshly severs her diminish'd pow'r:</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="33"/>Thus as the serpent, sleeping on the plain,</L>
<L>Feels the rude pressure of the loaded wain,</L>
<L>With apt revenge, and indignation stung,</L>
<L>She rears her crest, and darts her fiery tongue,</L>
<L>But impotent of rage, her trailing wound</L>
<L>She languishingly sweeps along the ground."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE clos'd the Seraph his illustrious theme,</L>
<L>Which on his audience flash'd conviction's beam.</L>
<L>—And now th' Enthusiast, with her hand high-rear'd,</L>
<L>Express'd a look demanding to be heard:</L>
<L>The circling Hierarchy, with one acclaim,</L>
<L>Urge her to vindicate her injur'd fame;</L>
<L>She, to their judgment fearlessly consign'd,</L>
<L>Thus pour'd th' effusion of her glowing mind:—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"BOLD on a tow'ring rock, with soul elate,</L>
<L>I saw BRITANNIA sit in regal state,</L>
<L>Around the globe she threw her vast survey,</L>
<L>And mark'd the realms devoted to her sway:</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="34"/>Her western clime, her oriental reign,</L>
<L>Her glory's theatre th' unbounded main:</L>
<L>I thus address'd her—'Hail, immortal dame,</L>
<L>Who high-exalted crowd'st the seat of fame,</L>
<L>Suspend the thoughts of thine imperial state.</L>
<L>And listen to th' event that heaves with fate:—</L>
<L>A prosp'rous mother (so did Heav'n ordain)</L>
<L>Bless'd and ennobled by a numerous train,</L>
<L>Beheld (a stranger to affection's tie)</L>
<L>Her youngest born with a disclaiming eye,</L>
<L>And, breaking loose from ev'ry moral band,</L>
<L>Stretch'd o'er th' innocuous babe an iron hand,</L>
<L>And hard'ning in her wrath, the helpless child</L>
<L>Was from her presence and her thought exil'd:</L>
<L>This little outcast lately I survey'd,</L>
<L>As mid the flow'rets of the wild he play'd</L>
<L>Artless and gay, himself the wilder flow'r,</L>
<L>Bare to the with'ring heat and quenching show'r.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BRITANNIA quick return'd with loud acclaim,</L>
<L>'O piteous infant, O inhuman dame!</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="35"/>Where, where does she abide, that I may dart</L>
<L>The shaft of death into her wolfish heart?'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS then I added with indignant air—</L>
<L>'Dismiss thy threats, thy warm resentment spare,</L>
<L>Or droop thyself beneath a flood of shame,</L>
<L>Thine, thine the child, and thou th' inhuman dame.'</L>
<L>I said—and throwing back my flowing vest,</L>
<L>Disclos'd the infant clinging at my breast:</L>
<L>'Behold,' I cried, ' this flow'ret of the wild,</L>
<L>This orphan nursling, this rejected child,</L>
<L>Mark how around his brow of virtue's mold,</L>
<L>The signs of greatness dare ev'n now unfold;</L>
<L>How on the vigorous eye the morning ray</L>
<L>Preludes the splendor of meridian day:</L>
<L>Marvellous infant, doom'd to act my plan,</L>
<L>AMERICANUS, hasten into man!</L>
<L>O doom'd to act what Heaven's dread thought devis'd,</L>
<L>Thou at the font of Energy baptis'd,</L>
<L>Whose rigid waves thy conscious soul encreas'd,</L>
<L>Myself at once the sponsor and the priest——'"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<L>'ENOUGH,' th' abruptly-rising Quire exclaim,</L>
<L>'Aspire, Enthusiast, to thy wonted fame;</L>
<L>Thy virtues, claims, and eminence we own,</L>
<L>Resume thy dignities, ascend thy throne:</L>
<L>Still to frail man thy daring strength impart,</L>
<L>Still flame th' incentive seraph of his heart;</L>
<L>And when the scenes of earth shall fade away,</L>
<L>And man shall need no more thy active ray,</L>
<L>Then, sacred object of our praiseful theme,</L>
<L>Bright emanation of th' eternal beam,</L>
<L>Thou shalt regain thy native, dread abode,</L>
<L>And glow for ever in the breast of GOD.'</L>
