<P>LOVE'S FRAILTIES: A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS, AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT-GARDEN.</P>

<P>THOSE passages that are printed in <HI>Italics</HI> (not in∣cluding the French) were omitted on the first repre∣sentation, one excepted, page 66, of which the words that then gave offence are distinguished by capitals. They are thus pointed out that the reader, who in the heat of political zeal has not quite lost his understanding, may examine what there is in them injurious to truth, or the good of mankind, and find it, if he can. In different times and under different feelings, it will appear astonish∣ing that any one of these passages were suppressed, from any apprehension of political resentment: but such was the fact. That the one unwarily retained should excite the anger which was testified is still more astonishing. A sentence so true as to have been repeated in a thousand different modes: for all strong moral truths are subject to such repetition. A sentence that, under a variety of forms and phraseology, is proverbial in all nations. It ought however to be remembered, that the persons offended, though violent, were few. Their intention doubtless was good: the same cannot be affirmed of their intellect.</P>
<P>Those who are acquainted with German literature, and who have read the drama entitled, <HI>Der Deutsche Hausvater,</HI> by the Baron von Gemmingen, will immediately perceive that the author has availed himself of various incidents and thoughts in that piece; though his fable, characters, and denouement are exceedingly different. Others, who wish to satisfy their curiosity but who cannot read Ger∣man, may find a French translation of that piece in vo∣lume VI. of a work entitled <HI>Nouveau Theatre Allemand,</HI> by M. M. Friedel and de Bonneville.</P>

<P>THE reasons which have occasioned the alteration of price in the present comedy ought to be stated to the public. The previous knowledge of men and manners, and the extraordinary efforts of study, time, and talents, which are necessary to produce a play that has but a chance of being sanctioned by the town, are sufficiently obvious. The labourer is worthy of his hire. In the be∣ginning of the present century, the price of an octavo play was eighteen pence. Since that period, the price of pa∣per has been doubled; the expence of printing is advanced in nearly the same ratio; and advertising, which now amounts to a considerable sum, was then a burthen un∣known. It has long been the complaint of the trade that the purchase of the copy-right, added to the above costs, occasioned plays to be a dangerous speculation. The new tax on paper, in addition to all these, has made it impossi∣ble, at the former price, to reward authors, and afford the bookseller a reasonable hope of profit. These consi∣derations have induced an advance of price, at which it is presumed no just reasoner will take offence.</P>

<L>AS some poor wand'rer, who with eager flight</L>
<L>Is homeward hurried by the approach of night,</L>
<L>Comes to the deep abyss, o'er which is thrown</L>
<L>Trunk of old oak or wedge of unhewn stone,</L>
<L>Tremendous bridge! which he must venture o'er,</L>
<L>Braving the horrid gulph and cataract roar,</L>

<L>The first false step is death! Yet cross he must,</L>
<L>Safely on t'other side looks shivering back,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>I WILL not hear you, Louisa. In love yourself with a man destitute of rank and fortune, ought you to school me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man of family, brother, though not of rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pennyless: a lieutenant in a marching regiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But possessed of honour, worth, and virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who has more honour worth and vir∣tue than my Paulina?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>A painter's daughter, Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>A divinity! Her beauty angelic, her mind godlike!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus we lovers rave. The world con∣tains but one!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is there another Paulina? Encum∣bered by the absurdities of folly, disguised by the
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
ridiculous trappings of fashion, where shall the sin∣cere, the simple, the affectionate heart be found? I enter the tumultuous assemblies of the idle and all is vanity, all affectation, all incoherency. This hubbub of incongruous and despicable passions but maddens my mind: and, by the contrast, irra∣diates the abode of peace and Paulina.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Charles, you forget our depen∣dent situation; our family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our fools and tyrants. An elder brother, whose rank wealth and power, instead of afford∣ing us protection, have been made the passports of folly and vice; and an uncle, whose benevolence is self love; who has given us shelter only to make us slaves; at once a cynic and a sensualist; severe to others, indulgent to himself; arbitrary in prin∣ciple, libidinous in practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, too true! Sir Gregory pardons nobody's faults but his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not suffer his sister to languish and die in penury in a foreign land? And what was her crime? Marriage, with a man of a noble mind; but who had the misfortune to be poor and un∣protected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis that makes me shudder! <Q>The very same fate is impending over our heads.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Let it fall; at least on me. Injus∣tice to myself shall not make me unjust to others.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Ay, but there's the question. Your poor painter's daughter may, considering the indigence in which she has been bred, be the phoenix you think her; but can you Charles honestly aver she is the equal of Lady Fan∣court?</Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has conceived a partiality for you; Sir Gregory has discovered it, and is determined on the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my sake, think again.</P>

<P>At your request, I have already been tor∣turing Paulina and myself: I have not seen her for a week; an excruciating eternal week. <Q>But I will be guilty of this cruel injustice no longer.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Remember your own principles, Charles, remember truth. We must not with the avarice of egotism live for self, but for so∣ciety. You have duties to mankind, for the fulfilling of which you ought not to be disabled by the indulgence of passion.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>I own it; and the doubts of what these duties are, haunt and perturb my mind incessant∣ly, render me undecided, cause me every hour to form a thousand contradictory plans, and, instead of making me active and firm, murder resolution and torment me into restless sus∣pence.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Lady L.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Opinion is the slave of error, the

world is the slave of opinion, and we are the slaves of the world.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seym.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis your situation, Louisa, that rivets my shackles, which else I would break, and brave the world's injustice and an uncle's tyranny. But I know your affection for Mr. Compton, I am sen∣sible of his worth, and I cannot dare not abandon you to the wretchedness I foresee, should I dis∣obey Sir Gregory.</P>

the interim, met my man, lodged a bullet in his body, sent an attested account of the affair to the papers, took post for Dover, and enjoyed a hearty supper, my bottle of Burgundy, a French <HI>chanson d'amour,</HI> and a sound sleep, the next night at Calais.</Q></P>

<P>True. The lord to whom I sent a pair of pictures has appointed to see me. I must go. Yet why? I shall gain no admittance. Not at home, is the everlasting answer. The insolent por∣ter will scarcely open the gate wide enough for my hand to enter. But I am poor, and must wait, and come again, and again, and take affronts patiently. So it is. The lord within, sits in state, reveling, banqueting, and tantalizing the palled appetite; while the wretch without, repulsed, insulted, and refused his due, is perhaps perishing with hunger!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think the men of former ages were guilty of as great vices as those of the present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Craig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Keep your mouth▪ shut—Greater: but they did not make a system of vice; they were hurried into it by their passions. Theirs were the crimes of men. There is a disgraceful a contempti∣ble meanness in the vices, as well as the persons of
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
the present puny race; and neither their passions nor their bodies have sufficient prowess to make them commit acts, that can entitle them to re∣spect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Rises with animation)</STAGE> If they fight a duel, it is not in the heat of anger, and desire of revenge; but it is done with as much ceremony and civility as if they were going to walk a minuet, or sip a dish of tea: ay and as little danger, too; for, as they manage the matter, there is ten times more terror in a crabtree cudgel than in lead and steel.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why as to the merit, or virtue, of fight∣ing duels, either in the old mode or the new, I believe we had better not talk of that.</P>

<P>The vestiges of ancient independence are wearing away. It makes my very heart ache to see the poor remains of towers, that once defied the fury of tyrants, and the war of elements, lye mouldering in ruins.</P>

<SPEAKER>Craig.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we erect a building, now, it is in such a light, frippery, unsubstantial style, that a pistol bullet would demolish it. A castle of cobwebs, spun in July, and brushed away in November.</P>

<P>Sir, you are a man of sense.</P>
