<P>Now my other trades are took up by motives of conveni∣ence, for being an apothecary, I sometimes keep my customer longer in the village than they otherwise might wish to stay—you know if they die, then I am a carpenter; and so finish my own job but if they shoud happen to recover, then I am a taylor, and make their cloaths-can't walk abroad you known without being fashionable</P>

<P>No—no—it won't hurt him, I take care never to hurt my nervous customers, they are the best customers I have to my back, tho' they are always ailing, they never die, so I don't get much out of them in the carpentering line, but as long as I hammer something out of them, I don't care how it is; do you know they wrote a song of me in these parts, they call me the wonderful barber, or Jack of all trades?
