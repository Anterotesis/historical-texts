<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. GARRICK.</BYLINE>
<L>WHEN Philip's son led forth his warlike band,</L>
<L>To die, or conquer, in a distant land;</L>
<L>To fan the fire, a martial muse he chose;</L>
<L>From Homer's song a new Achilles rose!</L>
<L>When generous Athens her prime trophies won,</L>
<L>Vanquisb'd Darius, and Darius' son,</L>
<L>The stage breath'd war—the soldiers bosom burn'd,</L>
<L>And fiercer to the field each chief return'd:</L>
<L>Now, when the world resounds with loud alarms,</L>
<L>When victory sits plan'd on Britain's arms,</L>
<L>Be war our theme: the hero's glorious toil,</L>
<L>And virtue springing from the iron soil!</L>
<L>Our scenes present a siege in story known;</L>
<L>Where magnanimity, and valour shone:</L>
<L>If nature guides us, if the hand of truth</L>
<L>Draws the just portrait of a Roman youth,</L>
<L>Who, with the best and noblest passions sir'd,</L>
<L>In the same moment, conquer'd and expir'd;</L>
<L>Perhaps your bearts may own the pictur'd woe,</L>
<L>And from a fonder source your sorrows flow:</L>
<L>Whilst warm remembrance aids the poet's strain,</L>
<L>And England weeps for English heroes slain.</L>

<L>But thou dost not consider</L>
<L>Th' importance of this war. We fight not now,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
As oft since Freedom fell our fathers fought,</L>
<L>When Latian chiefs contended who should reign,</L>
<L>With half the senate listed on each side;</L>
<L>The victor still was Roman, and rever'd</L>
<L>The gods and temples of immortal Rome.</L>
<L>But o'er yon mighty host, that girds our walls,</L>
<L>Fierce MAXIMIN commands: whether of Thrace,</L>
<L>Or wild Dalmatia, so obscure his birth,</L>
<L>Himself scarce knows; but sure Barbarian born.</L>
<L>This savage soldier, nurs'd in blood and war,</L>
<L>Whom military frenzy hath set up</L>
<L>To trample on mankind, abhors a Roman;</L>
<L>And marks for death the noble and the brave.</L>
<L>His yoke, at last, th' indignant senate scorns,</L>
<L>The slumb'ring Genius of our country wakes,</L>
<L>And rouses slothful Italy to arms.</L>
<L>The furious tyrant from the frontier hastes,</L>
<L>Like a wild beast gall'd by the hunter's spear,</L>
<L>And, breathing vengeance, rushes upon Rome:</L>
<L>Here first oppos'd, tenfold his fury burns;</L>
<L>Here, in the pass of fate, our father stands,</L>
<L>Defies and stops the monster in his rage,</L>
<L>Till Rome's last legions come to give him battle.</L>
<L>Now, when a soldier's life is of such moment,</L>
<L>When destiny hangs on a single day,</L>
<L>To fight for glory, TITUS, were a crime.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, PAULUS, no! it is not fame alone</L>
<L>That TITUS seeks to purchase from the foe;</L>
<L>Tho' such a crime the gods and men would pardon.</L>
<L>I know the peril that o'er Rome impends,</L>
<L>And know the hated cause of all our ills,</L>
<L>That army, only brave against their country,</L>
<L>I mean to smite them, and their giant leader,</L>
<L>Whom nature for a gladiator form'd,</L>
<L>To be the sport, and not the lord, of Rome.</L>
<L>The blow once struck, our foe must raise the siege,</L>
<L>Or waste his veterans in vain attacks,</L>
<L>And give to GORDIANUS easy conquest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Were this a frontier city far from Rome,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
And yon huge host compos'd of foes remote,</L>
<L>German, or Parthian; I would say to thee,</L>
<L>Lead on, my brother! Shield to shield we'd go,</L>
<L>And fire yon turret, or together perish.</L>
<L>But now when conquest by delay is gain'd,</L>
<L>When Aquileia guards the walls of Rome,</L>
<L>Dread of the great event has so possess'd me,</L>
<L>That, like the Persian soldier, I could stay</L>
<L>My arm uplifted, patient to the call</L>
<L>Of cautious Duty.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>And renouncing fame?</L>
<L>Oh! PAULUS! you have gain'd long since the prize</L>
<L>That I contend for. Every martial palm</L>
<L>Thy sword hath won. When I, like thee, am great</L>
<L>In deeds of arms, like thee I may be wary.</L>
<L>Now to my brother I lay bare my breast:</L>
<L>This famous siege approaches to its end;</L>
<L>Whatever end the ruling gods ordain,</L>
<L>Yet no distinguish'd action graces me.</L>
<L>I've done my duty. That I reckon nothing;</L>
<L>The meanest soldier has not shrunk from duty;</L>
<L>Son of AEMILIUS, and thy brother, PAULUS!</L>
<L>I must do more, and by the gods I will!</L>
<L>Here I have found a path that leads to glory;</L>
<L>Do not oppose me, else—we're friends no more.—</L>

<L>How points the enemy? This quiet night,</L>
<L>In preparation past, portends a storm.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PAULUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>On that attack which threats the eastern gate</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
The enemy hath labour'd all night long,</L>
<L>Repairing what the river's rage had ruin'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AEMILIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>It was a friendly flood. The river god</L>
<L>With all his waters guards his native walls;</L>
<L>On that strong quarter they can ne'er prevail.</L>
<L>The north I fear, where yon stupendous tower</L>
<L>Our works commands.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>It shall not long command,</L>
<L>Let but the consul grant me my desire.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AEMILIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What would my son?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their tower is weakly guarded.</L>
<L>At break of day, a soldier from yon camp</L>
<L>Fled to my post; hollow and gaunt he was;</L>
<L>His shrivell'd limbs scarce bore his sounding arms.</L>
<L>Like him, he said, with toil and famine worn,</L>
<L>Were half the tyrant's host. For MAXIMIN,</L>
<L>Mad with delay, and fiercer from repulse,</L>
<L>Reviles his soldiers, drives them to the trench</L>
<L>With whips and sharp reproach. This day, o'ercome</L>
<L>By strong necessity, he breathes a while,</L>
<L>And sends his legions forth, to gather in</L>
<L>Whatever this exhausted region yields.</L>
<L>I saw the busy foragers in troops</L>
<L>March, and disperse themselves on every side,</L>
<L>Like playful children on a summer day,</L>
<L>Secure and careless; for no martial band</L>
<L>Of late hath sallied from our guarded gates.</L>
<L>This is the time. Permit me, O my father!</L>
<L>Now to attack their ill defended lines,</L>
<L>And fire that mighty tower in which they trust.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AEMILIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well hast thou spoke, my son! thy zeal I love,</L>
<L>Nor must thy skill and judgment pass unprais'd.</L>
<L>Be thus attentive still, and trust me, TITUS,</L>
<L>In future sieges, and in other wars,</L>
<L>Swift execution shall thy purpose honour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ne'er shall I see another siege like this,</L>
<L>Ne'er draw my sword in such a glorious cause.</L>
<L>Alas! my lord! check not my spring of thought,</L>
<L>Nor nip the only bud it yet has borne.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AEMILIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Riper occasions will thy valour claim.</L>
<L>Danger comes on; Typhaeus-like it comes,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! judge not of the counsel by the weight</L>
<L>Of him that gives it. Would to heaven, my lord!</L>
<L>That I could now divest me of that youth</L>
<L>Which mars my credit. Chearfully I'd step</L>
<L>Far into age, to gain but for a day</L>

<SPEAKER>GARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>It has been busy. The presumptuous foe</L>
<L>In loose disorder'd squadrons rang'd the fields.</L>
<L>I watch'd the time; and sudden as the blast</L>
<L>That rises in the desart, out we rush'd</L>
<L>And swept them from the plain. Safe in our speed</L>
<L>We urg'd the chace far as the rising ground,</L>
<L>And unmolested view'd the camp below.</L>
<L>This worthy of your notice I observ'd,</L>
<L>Their wond'rous tower, the work of many a day,</L>
<L>Stands now protected by a feeble guard.</L>

<L>Let me go forth: be this my first exploit,</L>

<SPEAKER>CORNELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis strange to tell; but as I slumb'ring lay,</L>
<L>About that hour when glad Aurora springs,</L>
<L>To chace the lagging shades, methought I was</L>
<L>In Rome, and full of peace the city seem'd.</L>
<L>My mind oblivious too had lost it's care.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Serene I step'd along the lofty hall,</L>
<L>Imbellish'd with the statues of our fathers,</L>
<L>When suddenly an universal groan</L>
<L>Issued at once from every marble breast.</L>
<L>Aghast I gaz'd around! when slowly down</L>
<L>From their high pedestals I saw descend</L>
<L>The murder'd GRACCHI. Hand in hand, the brothers</L>
<L>Stalk'd towards me. As they approach'd more near,</L>
<L>They were no more the GRACCHI, but my sons</L>
<L>PAULUS and TITUS. At that dreadful change</L>
<L>I shriek'd and wak'd. But never from my mind</L>
<L>The spectacle shall part. Their rueful eyes!</L>
<L>Their cheeks of stone! the look of death and woe!</L>
<L>So strange a vision ne'er from fancy rose.</L>
<L>The rest, my lord! this holy Priest can tell.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AEMILIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why this is nothing but a common dream;</L>
<L>For often when the waking mind is charg'd</L>
<L>With apprehension of uncertain ills,</L>
<L>Imagination, in the hour of rest,</L>
<L>Presenteth wild fantastic combinations,</L>
<L>That have a shade and tincture of the past:</L>

<L>That joins the vain assemblage to futurity.</L>

<SPEAKER>PRIEST.</SPEAKER>
<L>Men reason thus, my lord! who think their reason</L>
<L>Can grasp and measure all; presumptuous thought!</L>
<L>Sounds more than human have been often heard,</L>
<L>And shapes celestial seen, by mortal man;</L>
<L>But yet most frequent in the silent night</L>
<L>Are warnings given by strange portentuous dreams.</L>
<L>The history of mighty Rome abounds</L>
<L>In awful instances. The old republic</L>
<L>By them has oft been sway'd; and oft preferv'd.</L>

<L>No further can I see into the cloud,</L>

<L>With sound of trumpet thro' the camp proclaim'd,</L>
<L>That he will give the city to be sack'd,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>OUR Author, as I'm told, is not to seek</L>
<L>In antient Lore; in Latin, nor in Greek.</L>
<L>I therefore did advise him, as a friend,</L>
<L>To make his learning serve some useful end:</L>
<L>And let me know, what rules he had observ'd,</L>
<L>What unities of time and place preserv'd.</L>
<L>He answer'd, Poetry is not an art;</L>
<L>'Tis nature only frames the poet's heart:</L>
<L>Still as he thinks, the scene he feels along,</L>
<L>And from his bosom bursts the raptur'd song.</L>
<L>This is the sacred oracle, the shrine</L>
<L>The bard consults, and here, the tuneful Nine.</L>
<L>With the same fire, the hearer's soul must glow,</L>
<L>Else vain to him, the tale of tragick woe.</L>
<L>There is a temper, which is all and all:</L>
<L>That sounds responsive to the poet's call.</L>
<L>Like Memnon's harp, which pour'd harmonious lays,</L>
<L>Whene'er its strings were touch'd by Phoebus' rays.</L>
<L>This temper of the soul is sweet and wild;</L>
<L>It sobs, or smiles, as sudden as a child;</L>
<L>To woes imagin'd tears unfeigned gives,</L>
<L>And in the poet's world of fancy lives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whilst thus he spoke, a bell was heard to ring;</L>
<L>He stop'd, and started like a guilty thing;</L>
<L>Ere the dread curtain rose, in haste withdrew,</L>
<L>And at a distance wails his doom from you.</L>
