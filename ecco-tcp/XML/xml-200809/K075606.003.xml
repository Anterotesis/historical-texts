<HEAD>THE EAGLE AND THE ROBIN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The political moral of this little apologue is too evident to need any other comment, than barely mentioning that the lady was Queen Anne; desiring the reader to recollect the change which she made in her ministry in 1709, the year in which this poem was written; and referring to Dr. King's "Rufinus, or the Favourite," in the English Poets, vol. XX. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 367 N.</NOTE>, An APOLOGUE; translated from the Original of AESOP, written Two Thousand Years since, and now rendered in familiar Verse by <HI>H.

<P>GOOD precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity. And here I present my good reader with one, delivered by the first founder of mythology, Aesop himself. Maximus Planudes takes notice of it, as a very excellent part of his production; and Phae∣drus, Camerarius, and others, seem to agree, that his Eagle, and five others not yet translated, are equal to

any of his that are handed down to us. Though Mr. Ogleby and Sir Roger L'Estrange had the unhappiness to be unacquainted with them, yet I had the good for∣tune to discover them by the removal of my old library, which has made me amends for the trouble of getting to where I now teach. They were written, or dictated at least, by Aesop, in the fifty-fourth Olympiad: and though I designed them chiefly for the use of my school (this being translated by a youth designed for a Greek professor), yet no man is so wise as not to need instruc∣tion, aye, and by the way of fable too; since the Holy Scriptures themselves, the best instructors, teach us by way of parable, symbol, image, and figure; and David was more moved with Nathan's "Thou art the man," than all the most rigid lectures in the world would have done. Whoever will be at the trouble of comparing this version with the original, let them begin at the tenth line, and they will find it metaphrastically done, <HI>verbum verbo,</HI> as the best way of justice to the author. Those that are meer adorers of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> will not be angry that it is in this sort of metre, for which I gave leave, the lad having a turn to this sort of measure, which is pleasant and agreeable, though not lofty. For my own part, I concur with my master Aristotle, that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> are very far from being unnecessary or unplea∣sant.

<HEAD>THE EAGLE AND THE ROBIN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. KING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To the works of this excellent Humourist, which were first collected in 1776, I prefixed some Memoirs of his Life; which have since been so elegantly epitomized, that it would be superfluous to enlarge on this article. Some extracts from his last biographer shall therefore supply the place: <Q REND="inline">"William King was born in London in 1663, the son of Ezekiel King, a gentleman. He was allied to the family of Clarendon. From Westminster-school, where he was a scholar on the foundation under the care of Dr. Busby, he was at eighteen elected to Christ-church, in 1681. In 1688, he was made master of arts; and, engaging in the study of the Civil Law, became doctor in 1692, and was admitted advocate at Doc∣tors Commons.—Though he was a regular advocate in the courts of civil and canon law, he did not love his profession, nor indeed any kind of business which interrupted his volup∣tuary dreams, or forced him to rouse from that indulgence in which only he could find delight. His reputation as a civi∣lian was yet maintained by his judgements in the courts of Delegates, and raised very high by the address and know∣ledge which he discovered in 1700, when he defended the earl of Anglesea against his lady, afterwards dutchess of Buckinghamshire, who sued for a divorce, and obtained it. The expence of his pleasures, and neglect of business, had now lessened his revenues; and he was willing to accept of a settlement in Ireland, where, about 1702, he was made judge of the admiralty, commissioner of the prizes, keeper of the records in Birmingham's tower, and vicar-general to Dr. Marsh the primate. But it is vain to put wealth within the reach of him who will not stretch out his hand to take it. King soon found a friend, as idle and thoughtless as himself, in Upton, one of the judges, who had a pleasant house called Mountown, near Dublin, to which King frequently retired; delighting to neglect his interest, forget his cares, and desert his duty. Here he wrote "Mully of Mountown," a poem, by which, though fanciful readers in the pride of sagacity have given it a political interpretation, was meant originally no more than it expressed, as it was dictated only by the au∣thor's delight in the quiet of Mountown. In 1708, when lord Wharton was sent to govern Ireland, King returned to London, with his poverty, his idleness, and his wit. In 1711, competence, if not plenty, was again put into his power. He was, without the trouble of attendance, or the mortification of a request, made gazetteer. He was now again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laced in a profitable employment, and again threw the be∣nefit away. An Act of Insolvency made his business at that time particularly troublesome; and he would not wait till hurry should be at an end, but impatiently resigned it, and returned to his wonted indigence and amusements. One of his amusements at Lambeth, where he resided, was to mor∣tify Dr. Tennison, the archbishop, by a publick festivity, on the surrender of Dunkirk to Hill; an event with which Ten∣nison's political bigotry did not suffer him to be delighted. King was resolved to counteract his sullenness, and at the ex∣pence of a few barrels of ale filled the neighbourhood with honest merriment. In the autumn of 1712 his health de∣clined; he grew weaker by degrees, and died on Christmas-day. Though his life had not been without irregularity, his principles were pure and orthodox, and his death was pious. After this relation, it will be naturally supposed that his poems were rather the amusements of idleness than efforts of study; that he endeavoured rather to divert than astonish; that his thoughts seldom aspired to sublimity; and that, if his verse was easy and his images familiar, he attained what he desired. His purpose is to be merry; though perhaps, to enjoy his mirth, it may be sometimes necessary to think well of his opinions."</Q> I need not repeat that this is quoted from Dr. Johnson.</P>

<LG>
<L>A LADY liv'd in former days,</L>
<L>That well deserv'd the utmost praise;</L>
<L>For greatness, birth, and justice fam'd,</L>
<L>And every virtue could be nam'd;</L>
<L>Which made her course of life so even,</L>
<L>That she's a Saint (if dead) in Heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<L>This Lady had a little seat</L>
<L>Just like a palace, 'twas so neat,</L>
<L>From aught (but goodness) her retreat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One morning, in her giving way,</L>
<L>As was her custom every day,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>To cheer the poor, the sick, and cold,</L>
<L>Or with apparel, food, or gold,</L>
<L>There came a gazing stranger by,</L>
<L>On whom, she quickly cast an eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The man admiring, made a stand;</L>
<L>He had a bird upon his hand:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>" What's that, says she, that hangs its head,</L>
<L>Sinking and faint? 'Tis almost dead."</L>
<L>" Madam, a Red-breast that I found,</L>
<L>By this wet season almost drown'd."</L>
<L>" Oh! bring him in, and keep him warm;</L>
<L>Robins do never any harm."</L>
<L>They soon obey'd, and chopt him meat,</L>
<L>Gave him whatever he would eat;</L>
<L>The Lady care herself did take,</L>
<L>And made a nest for Robin's sake:</L>
<L>But he perkt up into her chair,</L>
<L>In which he plenteously did fare,</L>
<L>Assuming quite another air.</L>
<L>The neighbours thought, when this they spy'd,</L>
<L>The world well mended on his side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With well-tun'd throat he whistled long,</L>
<L>And every body lik'd his song.</L>
<L>" At last, said they, this little thing</L>
<L>Will kill itself, so long to sing;</L>
<L>We 'll closet him among the rest</L>
<L>Of those my Lady loves the best."</L>
<L>They little thought, that saw him come,</L>
<L>That Robins were so quarrelsome:</L>
<L>The door they open'd, in he pops,</L>
<L>And to the highest perch he hops;</L>
<L>The party-colour'd birds he chose,</L>
<L>The Gold-finches, and such as those;</L>
<L>With them he'd peck, and bill, and feed,</L>
<L>And very well (at times) agreed:</L>
<L>Canary-birds were his delight,</L>
<L>With them he'd <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> all night;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>But the brown Linnets went to pot,</L>
<L>He kill'd them all upon the spot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The servants were employ'd each day,</L>
<L>Instead of work, to part some fray,</L>
<L>And wish'd the aukward fellow curst</L>
<L>That brought him to my Lady first.</L>
<L>At last they all resolv'd upon 't,</L>
<L>Some way to tell my Lady on 't.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meanwhile he 'd had a noble swing,</L>
<L>And rul'd just like the Gallic king;</L>
<L>Having kill'd or wounded all,</L>
<L>Unless the Eagle in the hall;</L>
<L>With whom he durst but only jar,</L>
<L>He being the very soul of war,</L>
<L>But hated him for his desert,</L>
<L>And bore him malice at his heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Eagle was my Lady's pride,</L>
<L>The guardian safety of her side:</L>
<L>He often brought home foreign prey,</L>
<L>Which humbly at her feet he lay.</L>
<L>For colour, pinions, and stature,</L>
<L>The fairest workmanship of nature;</L>
<L>'Twould do one good to see him move,</L>
<L>So full of grandeur, grace, and love:</L>
<L>He was indeed a bird for Jove.</L>
<L>He soar'd aloft in Brucum's field,</L>
<L>And thousand Kites and Vultures kill'd;</L>
<L>Which made him dear to all that flew,</L>
<L>Unless to Robin and his crew.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<L>One day poor Bob, puff'd up with pride,</L>
<L>Thinking the combat to abide,</L>
<L>A goose-quill on for weapon ty'd,</L>
<L>Knowing by use, that, now and then,</L>
<L>A sword less hurt does than a pen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As for example—What at home</L>
<L>You 've well contriv'd to do at Rome,</L>
<L>A pen blows up—before you come.</L>
<L>You are suppos'd to undermine</L>
<L>The foe—in some immense design.</L>
<L>A pen can bite you with a line;</L>
<L>There's forty ways to give a sign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well—all on fire away he stalk'd,</L>
<L>Till come to—where the Eagle walk'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bob did not shill-I shall-I go,</L>
<L>Nor said one word of friend or foe;</L>
<L>But flirting at him made a blow,</L>
<L>As game-cocks with their gauntlets do.</L>
<L>At which the Eagle gracefully</L>
<L>Cast a disdaining, sparkling eye;</L>
<L>As who should say—What 's this, a flie?</L>
<L>But no revenge at all did take,</L>
<L>He spar'd him for their Lady's sake,</L>
<L>Who ponder'd these things in her mind,</L>
<L>And took the conduct of the Eagle kind.</L>
<L>Upon reflection now—to shew</L>
<L>What harm the least of things may do,</L>
<L>Mad Robin, with his cursed flirt,</L>
<L>One of the Eagle's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, amongst the Greeks, signifies <Q REND="inline">"Honour as tender as the eye."</Q> KING.</NOTE> eyes had hurt;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>Inflam'd it, made it red and sore:</L>
<L>But the affront inslam'd it more.</L>
<L>Oh, how the family did tear!</L>
<L>To fire the house, could scarce forbear:</L>
<L>With scorn, not pain, the Eagle fir'd,</L>
<L>Murmur'd disdain, and so retir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Robin, to offer some relief,</L>
<L>In words like these would heal their grief:</L>
<L>" Should th' Eagle die (which Heaven forbid!)</L>
<L>We ought some other to provide.</L>
<L>I do not say that any now</L>
<L>Are fit, but in a year or two:</L>
<L>And should this mighty warrior fall,</L>
<L>They should not want a General."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As men have long observ'd, that one</L>
<L>Misfortune seldom comes alone;</L>
<L>Just in the moment this was done,</L>
<L>Ten thousand foes in sight were come;</L>
<L>Vultures, and Kites, and birds of prey,</L>
<L>In flocks so thick—they darken'd day.</L>
<L>A long-concerted force and strong,</L>
<L>Vermin of all kinds made the throng;</L>
<L>Foxes were in the faction join'd,</L>
<L>Who waited their approach to ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By every hand, from common fame,</L>
<L>The frightful face of danger came.</L>
<L>One cries, "What help now—who can tell?</L>
<L>I'm glad the Eagle 's here, and well!"</L>
<L>Another, out of breath with fear,</L>
<L>Says, "Thousands more near sea appear;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>They'll swop our Chicken from the door;</L>
<L>We never were so set before:</L>
<L>We're glad the Eagle will forget,</L>
<L>And the invaders kill or beat."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reserv'd and great, his noble mind,</L>
<L>Above all petty things inclin'd,</L>
<L>Abhorr'd the thoughts of any thing.</L>
<L>But what his Lady's peace could bring:</L>
<L>Who bless'd him first, and bade him do</L>
<L>As he was wont, and beat the foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Burning and restless as the sun,</L>
<L>Until this willing work was done;</L>
<L>He whets his talons, stretch'd his wings,</L>
<L>His lightning darts, and terror flings;</L>
<L>Towers with a flight into the sky,</L>
<L>These million monsters to descry,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to conquer, or to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The party, that so far was come,</L>
<L>Thought not the Eagle was at home:</L>
<L>To fame and danger us'd in field,</L>
<L>They knew he'd quickly make them yield:</L>
<L>But, on assurance he was near,</L>
<L>Incumber'd, faint, and dead with fear,</L>
<L>They made with hurry towards the lakes;</L>
<L>And he his pinions o'er them shakes.</L>
<L>They had not (with such horror fill'd)</L>
<L>The courage to let one be kill'd:</L>
<L>They fled, and left no foe behind,</L>
<L>Unless it were the fleeting wind:</L>
<L>Only—a man by water took</L>
<L>Two fine young Merlins and a Rook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<L>The family had now repose:</L>
<L>But with the sun the Eagle rose;</L>
<L>Th' imperial bird pursued the foe,</L>
<L>More toil than rest inur'd to know.</L>
<L>He wing'd his way to Latian land,</L>
<L>Where first was hatch'd this murdering band;</L>
<L>He darted death where-e'er he came,</L>
<L>Some of them dying at his name.</L>
<L>Their mighty foe—a fatal pledge,</L>
<L>Their bowels tore through every hedge:</L>
<L>They flutter, shriek, and caw, and hiss;</L>
<L>Their strength decays, and fears increase:</L>
<L>But most the chevaliers the Geese.</L>
<L>So many slaughter'd fowl there was,</L>
<L>Their carcases block'd-up the ways;</L>
<L>The rest he drove, half spent, pell-mell,</L>
<L>Quite to the walls of Pontifell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Robin at home, though mad to hear</L>
<L>He should so conquer every where,</L>
<L>Expostulated thus with fear:</L>
<L>" Ungrateful I, that so have stirr'd</L>
<L>Against this generous, noble bird,</L>
<L>Wast thou not first by him preferr'd?</L>
<L>Let's leave him in his gall to burn,</L>
<L>And back to Pontifell return."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There some to chimney-tops aspire,</L>
<L>To turrets some that could fly higher;</L>
<L>Some 'bove a hundred miles were gone,</L>
<L>To roost them at Byzantium.</L>
<L>Alas! in vain was their pretence,</L>
<L>He broke through all their strong defence:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>Down went their fences, wires, and all;</L>
<L>Perches and birds together fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>None hop'd his power to withstand,</L>
<L>But gave the nest to his command;</L>
<L>They told him of ten thousand more,</L>
<L>In flocks along the Ganges' shore,</L>
<L>Safe in their furrows, free from trouble,</L>
<L>Like Partridges among the stubble.</L>
<L>He spreads himself, and cuts the air,</L>
<L>And steady flight soon brought him there.</L>
<L>Lord, how deceiv'd and vex'd he was!</L>
<L>To find they were but meer Jackdaws.</L>
<L>A hundred thousand all in light,</L>
<L>They all could chatter, not one fight.</L>
<L>" I'll deal by them as is their due:</L>
<L>" Shough! cry'd the Eagle; off they flew."</L>
<L>His flashing eyes their hearts confounds,</L>
<L>Though by their flight secure from wounds,</L>
<L>Which was a signal, fatal baulk</L>
<L>To a late swift Italian Hawk.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Eagle would no rest afford,</L>
<L>Till he had sent my Lady word;</L>
<L>Who when she heard the dear surprize,</L>
<L>Wonder and joy stood in her eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" My faithful Eagle, hast thou then</L>
<L>My moral foes destroy'd again?</L>
<L>Return, return, and on me wait;</L>
<L>Be thou the guardian of my gate;</L>
<L>Thee and thy friends are worth my care,</L>

<HEAD><PB N="20" REF="23"/>BIBLIOTHECA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the interests of Virtue and Religion are best se∣cured by the severest reason and argument, yet I hope a less solemn recommendation of them to the world- may not be esteemed a prejudice to either. How oft has a stubborn folly been successfully arraigned by a candid and easy rebuke, which had long maintained itself against a more powerful, though a less familiar, conviction! If we can smile away the follies of an adversary, sport with his vanities, and laugh him into a sense of his errors; why should we forfeit that exquisite pleasure of complacency and good-humour, which a malicious conflict with a rival would most certainly deprive us of? If we miscarry in an attempt of this nature, our defeat would be the less dishonourable, because we seemed only to play and trifle with the mistakes of an author; but should we, under the mask of a little raillery, wit, and good-humour, obtain our end, it would double our satisfaction, as well as the glory of our conquest. Two important debates of the utmost consequence in religion (Eachard's Contempt of the Clergy, and Philautus and Timothy) have with won∣derful applause lately appeared in the world; the beauties of their author's stile, the purity of their diction, the elegant turn of thought, and above all a torrent of severe but good-natured wit, drew a thousand readers to peruse an hypothesis they little imagined ever to espouse; but they were insensibly deluded into good principles, and betrayed into a conviction of those very truths they came on purpose to deride and ridicule. Where they expected to gratify a fancy only, they found a more real advantage in the reformation of their judgement, and, from admirers of the author's wit and beauties, became at last proselytes to their opinions. If in two or three instances I have transgressed my own rules, the Fool or the Knave must be imagined very notorious; and that those tender and merciful lashes that were judged sufficient for little offenders would hardly have reached the vanities of the one, or the villainies of the other. And if I am thought to have injured any person in his character, or to have said as much as I am able, I must beg leave to assure the world, that it was owing to abundance of humanity and good-nature I did not say a great deal more; and would rather advise them to sit easy and quiet under the innocent rebukes of a satire, than provoke others to prepare that correction, which their ignorance, their impudence, or both, have so justly deserved.

In January 1715, when, according to the order of succession at that time observed, he was the next to be chosen into a fellowship, he resigned his demiship, and left the college, being determined against taking the oaths to the new government.

He was born Jan. 25, 1640; and at an early age travelled with Dr. Killigrew, afterwards master of the Savoy, who gave him a just and true relish of poetry, and all the refinements of wit and sense. He joined the party which opposed the arbitrary proceedings of Charles the Second, and was very active in all the measures which were adopted against that monarch and his successor James the Second.

<HEAD>SONG ON A LADY INDISPOSED.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. BEVIL HIGGONS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An account of this poet has been already printed in vol. I. p. 128; to which the following anecdote may be added. <Q REND="inline">"King Charles II. sold Dunkirk to Louis XIV. and gave him English oak enough to build the very fleet that after∣wards attacked and defeated one of ours in Bantry Bay on the coast of Ireland. This puts me in mind of the foresight of a gentleman, who had been some time envoy from the king to the princes and states of Italy, and who, in his return home, made the coast of France his road; in order to be as useful to his country as possible, and to his sovereign too, as he thought. In his audience of the king, he told his majesty, that the French were hard at work, building men of war in several of their ports, and that such a hasty increase of the naval power of France could not but threaten England's so∣vereignty of the seas, and consequently portend destruction to her trade. The gentleman was in the right, for our trade and the sovereignty of the seas are dependent on each other; they must live or die together. But what a recompense do you think he met with for his fidelity? really such a one as I would hardly have believed, had I been told it by any person but his own son, the late Mr. Bevil Higgons, whose works, both in prose and verse, have made him known to all the men of letters in Britain, and whose attachment to the fa∣mily of Stuart, even to his dying day, puts his veracity in this point out of dispute. The recompence was a severe re∣primand from the king, as the fore-runner to the laying him aside, for talking of things which his majesty told him it was not his business to meddle with."</Q> I forget from which of the political writers between 1730 and 1740 this anecdote was transcribed; most probably The Craftsman.

<HEAD>THE APPARITION, BY ABEL EVANS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Abel Evans, the author of this and the following poems, though a man of genius, the friend of the first poets of the times, and applauded by them, is now hardly known. He is generally styled Dr. Evans the Epigrammist, and was one of the Oxford wits enumerated in the following distich (wretchedly imitated in the "Additions to Pope," vol. I. p. 163.):
<Q><L>" Alma novem genuit celebres Rhedycina poetas;</L>

He is likewise mentioned in the Dunciad, B. II. ver. 116. in company with Dr. Young and Dean Swift, as one of the authors whose works had been claimed by James More Smith. Dr. Evans was of St. John the Baptist's College, Oxford; and took the degree of M.A. March 23, 1699; that of B.D. April 26, 1705; and D.D. May 16, 1711. He was bursar to his college; vicar of St. Gyles's, Oxford; and appears to have been intimate with Mr. Pope, to whom there are two letters by him in print, in one of which the initial letter W. (intended for his Christian name) is by mistake put instead of that by which he used to sign himself. R.</NOTE>, D.D. OCCASIONED BY THE PUBLICATION OF TINDAL'S RIGHTS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.</HEAD>

"Plantarum Historia universalis Oxoniensis, seu Herbarum Distributio nova,"
and was to have added a third volume on trees, but died in 1679. The first volume of that work was compiled by Dr. Robert Morrison, a native of Aberdeen, who, quit∣ting Scotland in the troubles, studied at Paris, took a degree in physic at Angers, directed the royal gardens at Blois till the death of the duke of Orleans; at the Restoration he was appointed overseer of the king's gardens, fellow of the College of Physicians, and in 1669 professor of Botany in the University of Oxford, where he read lectures till he set about publishing the "Universal Knowledge of Simples."

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gloriae Dei optimi Maximi, Honori Caroli I. Regis, in usum Academiae &amp; Reipublicae, Hen∣ricus Comes Danby, anno 1632."</Q>
The Earl also settled an annual revenue for the maintenance of the Garden, and for supplying it with plants and herbs, with which it is well stocked. Dr. Sherrard, who was Consul at Smyrna, brought from thence a fine collection of exotics, built a library here, furnished it with botanical books, and augmented the pro∣fessorship. The noble founder of the garden was created by king James I. baron Danvers of Dantsey; and by king Charles I. earl of Danby, and made a knight of the Bath. Dying unmarried, Jan. 20, 1643, the title became extinct; but was revived, in 1674, in the family of the duke of Leeds. N.</NOTE> planted, Bobart till'd.</L>

"The Ramble, an Anti-heroick Poem, together with some Terrestrial Hymns and Carnal Ejaculations, by Alexander Radcliffe, of Grays Inn, Esq. 1682,"
8vo; inscribed to James Lord Annesley. He had published in 1680
"Ovid Travestie, a Burlesque upon Ovid's Epistles;"
with a satirical introduction occasioned by the "Preface to a late-Book, called The Wits paraphrased." Mr. Tonson printed a third edition of this Travestie in 1696. The Dedication "To Robert Fairbeard, of Grays Inn, Esq." is no bad specimen of the author's humour. <Q REND="inline">"Having com∣mitted these Epistles to the Press, I was horribly put to it for a Patron. I thought of some great Lord, or some angelic Lady; but then again considered I should never be able to adorn my Dedication with benign beams, corruscant rays, and the Devil and all of influence. At last I heard my good friend Mr. Fairbeard was come to town—nay then—all's well enough. To you therefore I offer this English Ovid, to whom you may not be unaptly compared in several parcels of your life and conversation, only with this exception, that you have nothing of his Tristibus. 'Tis you who burlesque all the fop∣pery and conceited gravity of the age. I remember you once told a grave and affected Advocate, 'that he burlesqued God's image, for God had made him after his own likeness, but he made himself look like an ass.' Upon the whole matter I am very well satisfied in my choice of you for a judge; if you speak well of the book, 'tis all I desire, and the bookseller will have reason to rejoice: though by your approbation you may draw upon yourself a grand inconvenience; for perhaps you may too often have songs, sonnets, madrigals, and an innumerable army of stanzas obtruded upon you by, Sir, Your humble servant, ALEX.

<HEAD>PART OF VIRGIL'S FIRST GEORGICK,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>TRANSLATED BY HENRY SACHEVERELL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The history of this man affords a very striking example of the folly and madness of party, which could exalt an ob∣scure individual, possessed of but moderate talents, to an height of popularity that the present times behold with wonder and astonishment. He was the son of Joshua Sa∣cheverell of Marlborough clerk (who died minister of St. Peter's Church in Marlborough, leaving a numerous family in very low circumstances). Henry was put to school at Marlborough, at the charge of Mr. Edward Hearst, an apo∣thecary, who, being his godfather, adopted him as his son, Hearst's widow put him afterwards to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became demy in 1687, at the age of 15. Young Sacheverell soon distinguished himself by a regular ob∣servation of the duties of the house, by his compositions, good-manners, and genteel behaviour; qualifications which recommended him to that society, of which he was fellow, and, as public tutor, had the care of the education of most of the young gentlemen of quality and fortune that were ad∣mitted of the college. In this station he bred a great many persons eminent for their learning and abilities; and among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> others was tutor to Mr. Holdsworth, whose "Muscipula" and "Dissertations on Virgil" have been so deservedly esteem∣ed. He was contemporaty and chamber-fellow with Mr. Addison, and one of his chief intimates till the time of his famous trial. Mr. Addison's
"Account of the greatest English Poets,"
dated April 3, 1694, in a Farewell-poem to the Muses on his intending to enter into holy orders, was inscribed "to Mr. Henry Sacheverell," his <HI>then</HI> dearest friend and colleague. Much has been said by Sacheverell's enemies of his ingratitude to his relations, and of his turbulent beha∣viour at Oxford; but these appear to have been groundless ca∣lumnies, circulated only by the spirit of party. In his younger years he wrote some excellent Latin poems: besides several in the second and third volumes of the "Musae Anglicanae," ascribed to his pupils, there is a good one of some length in the second volume, under his own name (transcribed from the Oxford Collection, on Q. Mary's death, 1695). He took the degree of M.A. May 16, 1696; B.D, Feb. 4, 1707; D.D. July 1, 1708. His first preferment was Cannock, in the county of Stafford. He was appointed preacher of St. Saviour's, Southwark, in 1705; and while in this station preached his famous sermons (at Derby, Aug. 15, 1709; and at St. Paul's, Nov. 5, in the same year); and in one of them was supposed to point at lord Godolphin. under the name of <HI>Volpone.</HI> It has been suggested, that to this circumstance, as much as to the doctrines contained in his sermons, he was indebted for his prosecution, and eventually for his prefer∣ment. Being impeached by the house of commons, his trial began Feb. 27, 1709-10; and continued until the 23d of March: when he was sentenced to a suspension from preach∣ing for three years, and his two sermons ordered to be burnt. This ridiculous prosecution overthrew the ministry, and laid the foundation of his fortune. To Sir Simon Harcourt, who was counsel for him, he presented a silver bason gilt, with an ele∣gant inscription. He very soon after was collated to a living near Shrewsbury; and, in the same month that his suspension ended, had the valuable rectory of St. Andrew Holborn given him by the Queen. At that time his reputation was so high, that he was enabled to sell the first sermon, preached after his sentence expired, for the sum of 100l.; and upwards of 40,000 copies, it is said, were soon fold. We find by Swift's Journal to Stella, Jan. 22, 1711-12, that he had also interest enough with the ministry to provide very amply for one of his bro∣thers; yet, as the Dean had said before, Aug. 24, 1711, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they hated, and affected to despise him."</Q> In 1716, he prefixed a dedication to "Fifteen Discourses, occasionally de∣livered before the University of Oxford, by W. Adams, M.A. late student of Christ Church, and rector of Staunton upon Wye, in Oxfordshire." After this publication, we hear little of him, except by quarrels with his parishioners, al∣though he was much suspected to be concerned in Atterbury's plot. A considerable estate at Callow in Derbyshire was left to him by his kinsman Geo. Sacheverell, esq. He died June 5, 1724; and, by his will, bequeathed to Bishop Atterbury, then in exile, who was supposed to have penned his defence for him, the sum of 500l. By a letter to him from his uncle, 1711, it appears, that he had a brother named Thomas, and a sister Susannah. — The dutchess of Marlborough describes him as
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an ignorant impudent incendiary; a man who was the scorn even of those who made use of him as a tool."</Q>
Account, &amp;c. p. 247. — And Bp. Burnet says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He was a bold insolent man, with a very small measure of religion, virtue, learning, or good sense; but he resolved to force himself into popularity and preferment, by the most petulant railings at Dissenters and Low-church men, in several sermons and libels, wrote without either chaste∣ness of style, or liveliness of expression."</Q>

<BYLINE>BY JOHN EARL OF ROCHESTER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The poems of this witty but profligate nobleman were very judiciously pruned by Dr. Johnson before their ad∣mission into the tenth volume of the English Poets. The Song here preserved, however, is sufficiently exempt from the censure too many of this writer's poems have deserved. In the "Supplement to Swift," I have had occasion to observe, from Mr. Granger, that Rochester had natural modesty. The fact is, he wrote but little of the ribaldry which passes under his name; but, having obtained the character of a lewd writer, every thing in that strain was fathered upon him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In all his works,"</Q> Dr. Johnson says,

<HEAD>ON THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. PARNELL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Parnell, D.D. descended from an antient fa∣mily of Congleton in Cheshire, was born in Dublin, in the year 1679; and was admitted a member of Dublin College at the early age of thirteen. He took his degree of M.A. July 9, 1700; and in the same year was ordained a deacon by Dr. William King, then bishop of Derry, having a dis∣pensation from the primate, as being under twenty-three years of age. He was admitted into priests orders about three years after, by Dr. King, then archbishop of Dublin; and was collated by Dr. St. George Ashe, bishop of Clogher, to the archdeaconry of Clogher, Feb. 9, 1705. About that time also he married Miss Anne Minchin, a young lady of great merit and beauty, by whom he had two sons, who died young, and a daughter, living in 1770. Swift, in his Journal to Stella, August 24, 1712, say,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am heartily for poor Mrs. Parnell's death: she seemed ro be an excel∣lent good-natured young woman, and I believe the poor lad is much afflicted: they appeared to live perfectly well to∣gether."</Q>
This event is supposed to have made an indelible impression on his spirits. He was warmly recommended by the Dean to archbishop King: who gave him a prebend in 1713, and the vicarage of Finglas (worth about 400 l. a year) May 31, 1716. His gratitude is beautifully expressed in a poem on the Dean's birth-day, 1713. He died at Chester, in July 1718, on his way to Ireland; and was buried in Trinity church in that town, without any monu∣ment to mark the place of his interment. As he left no male issue, his estate devolved to his only nephew, Sir Sir John Parnell, baronet, whose father was younger brother to the archdeacon, and one of the justices of the king's bench in Ireland. The character of Dr. Parnell is admirably pour∣trayed by Dr. Goldsmith, in the Life prefixed to a volume of his Poems, originally published by Mr. Pope, in 1721. A posthumous volume was printed at Dublin in 1758. And both these volumes united, with several additional poems which I had formerly collected, are printed in the forty-fourth volume of the "English Poets." N.</NOTE>. <DATE>1715.</DATE></BYLINE>

<L>ART thou alive? It cannot be,</L>
<L>There 's so much rottenness in thee,</L>
<L>Corruption only is in death;</L>

<L>Think not you live because you speak,</L>

<L>From thee such noisome stenches come,</L>

<L>Thy body is a corpse that goes,</L>

<L>A pestilence, that walks by day,</L>

<L>But I will to my Chloris run,</L>

<L>There will I healing nectar sip,</L>
<L>And, to be sav'd, approach her lip,</L>
<L>Though, if I touch the matchless dame,</L>
<L>I 'm sure to burn with inward flame.</L>
<L>Thus, when I would one danger shun,</L>
<L>I 'm straight upon another thrown:</L>
<L>I seek a cure, one sore to ease,</L>
<L>Yet in that cure 's a new disease</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="219"/>But Love, though fatal, still can bless,</L>
<L>And greater dangers hide the less;</L>
<L>I 'll go where passion bids me fly,</L>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF POETRY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This and the preceding Poems by Dr. Parnell (as has been already said of Dr. Yalden) were omitted in the for∣mer collection only because they could not then be met with. I cannot but take this opportunity of correcting a mistake (which I was led into by Dr. Birch) in the note on the English Poets, vol. XLIV. p. 263. What is there said on the Poem on Queen Anne's Peace more probably belongs to this Essay. The peace was not signed till March 30, 1713. By Swift's Journal to Stella, Dec. 22, 25, 1712, Jan. 6. 17, 31, and Feb. 19, 1712-13, it appears that this poem received several corrections in consequence of hints from Dr. Swift, who introduced Parnell both to Oxford and Bolingbroke.

<HEAD>TO HENRY LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. PARNELL<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Allegory is in itself so retired a way of Writing, that it was thought proper to say something beforehand con∣cerning this Piece, which is entirely framed upon it. The design, therefore, is to shew the several Styles which have been made use of by those who have endeavoured to write in verse. The scheme, by which it is carried on, supposes an old Gre∣cian Poet couching his observations or instructions within an Allegory; which Allegory is wrought out upon the single word Flight, as in the figurative way it signifies a thought above the common level: here Wit is made to be Pegasus, and the Poet his Rider, who flies by several countries where he must not touch, by which are meant so many vicious Styles, and arrives at last at the Sublime. This way of Writing is not only very engaging to the fancy whenever it is well performed; but it has been thought also one of the first that the Poets made use of. Hence arose many of those stories concerning the Heathen Gods, which at first were in∣vented to insinuate Truth and Morality more pleasingly, and which afterwards made Poetry itself more solemn, when they happened to be received into the Heathen Divinity. And indeed there seems to be no likelier way by which a Poetical Genius may yet appear as an Original, than that he should proceed with a full compass of thought and knowledge, ei∣ther to design his plan, or to beautify the parts of it, in an allegorical manner. We are much beholden to Antiquity
for those excellent compositions by which Writers at present form their minds; but it is not so much required of us to ad∣here merely to their fables, as to observe their manner. For, if we preclude our own invention, Poetry will consist only in expression, or simile, or the application of old stories; and the utmost character to which a Genius can arrive will depend on imitation, or a borrowing from others, which we must agree together not to call stealing, because we take only from the Ancients. There have been Poets amongst ourselves, such as Spenser and Milton, who have successfully ventured further. These instances may let us see that Invention is not bounded by what has been done before: they may open our imaginations, and be one method of preserving us from Writing without schemes. As for what relates any further particularly to this Poem, the Reader will observe, that its aim is Instruction. Perhaps a representation of several mis∣takes and difficulties, which happen to many who write Poe∣try, may deter some from attempting what they have not been made for: and perhaps the description of several beau∣ties belonging to it may afford hints towards forming a Genius for delighting and improving mankind. If either of these happen, the Poem is useful; and upon that account its faults may be more easily excused. PARNELL.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>To burst asunder with a speechless sound;</L>
<L>And then with tumult and surprize they roll,</L>
<L>And shew the case important in the soul.</L>

<L>That what remains behind is more than guess'd.</L>

<L>Methinks a thousand Graces more I see,</L>
<L>And I could dwell—but when would thought be free?</L>
<L>Engaging Method ranges all the band,</L>

<L>Yet Art acknowledges their labours just.</L>
<L>From hence they look, from this exalted show,</L>

<L>That very word made Ellis start,</L>
<L>And all his blood ran to his heart;</L>
<L>He shook, and quak'd in every part</L>
<L>with anger:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="248" REF="251"/>
<L>He look'd as if nought might assuage</L>

<L>" A Cuckow's nest!" quoth he, and so</L>
<L>He humm'd, and held his head full low,</L>

<L>verpress him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, quoth he, "My mother said,</L>

<L>(God bless him!)</L>

<L>With that the Captain took a dish</L>
<L>That stood brim-full of butter'd fish,</L>
<L>As good as any heart could wish</L>
<L>to supper:</L>

<LG>
<L>For he took hold of any thing;</L>
<L>And first he caught the Poul of Ling,</L>

<L>about him:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="251" REF="254"/>
<L>Out of his hand it flew apace,</L>

<LG>
<L>And as the Lawyer thought to rise,</L>
<L>The salt was thrown into his eyes,</L>

<L>defeated.</L>

<L>All things near hand Nick Ballat threw;</L>

<L>the Parson:</L>

<LG>
<L>The sauce his coat did all bewet,</L>
<L>The Priest began to fume and fret,</L>
<L>The seat was butter'd which he set</L>
<L>his * * * * on:</L>

<LG>
<L>He knew not what to do or say,</L>
<L>It was in vain to preach or pray,</L>

<L>good people!"</L>

<LG>
<L>He might as well go strive to teach</L>
<L>Divinty beyond his reach;</L>
<L>Or, when the bells ring out, go preach</L>
<L>i' th' steeple.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this mischance, the silly man</L>
<L>Out of the room would fain have ran,</L>

<L>Ill luck had he; for, after that,</L>
<L>One threw the Parsnips full of fat,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Out of the place he soon repairs,</L>
<L>And ran half headlong down the stairs,</L>
<L>And made complaint to Master Aires,</L>
<L>with crying.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then up ran he to know the matter,</L>
<L>And found how they the things did scatter;</L>
<L>Here a Trencher, there a Platter,</L>
<L>were lying.</L>

<LG>
<L>I dare not say he stunk for woe,</L>

<L>Nor could you blame him if he did,</L>

<L>bepelt him.</L>

<L>He thrust himself into the throng,</L>
<L>And us'd the virtue of his tongue;</L>

<L>so many?</L>

<LG>
<L>The Candles were all shuffled out,</L>

<L>Now in the dark was all the coil;</L>
<L>Some were bloody in the broil,</L>

<L>The sight would make a man afeard:</L>

<L>Under the Boar Lluellin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Will Lluellin, a prisoner there, some time the keeper. R. S.</NOTE> lay,</L>
<L>Being sore affrighted with the fray,</L>
<L>And as the weapons flew that way,</L>
<L>he eat them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bread stuck in the windows all,</L>
<L>Like bullets in a castle-wall</L>

<L>And then the knave away did steal</L>
<L>Of food that fell no little deal,</L>
<L>And in his house at many a meal</L>
<L>he spent it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Captain ran the rest among,</L>
<L>As eager to revenge the wrong</L>
<L>Done by the Pot which Ellis flung</L>
<L>so stoutly:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And angry Ellis sought about</L>
<L>To find the furious Captain out;</L>
<L>At length they met, and then they fought</L>
<L>devoutly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, being met, they never lin,</L>
<L>Till with their loud robustious din</L>
<L>The room and all that was therein</L>
<L>did rumble.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Instead of weapons made of steel,</L>
<L>The Captain took a salted Eel,</L>
<L>And at each blow made Ellis reel</L>
<L>and tumble.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ellis a Pippin-pie had got,</L>
<L>A sorer weapon than the pot;</L>
<L>For, lo, the apples being hot</L>
<L>did scald him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Captain laid about him still,</L>
<L>As if he would poor Ellis kill,</L>
<L>And with his Eel with a good will</L>
<L>he maul'd him.</L>

<L>At length, quoth he, "Ellis, thou art</L>
<L>A fellow of courageous heart,</L>
<L>Yield now, and I will take thy part</L>

<LG>
<L>Quoth Ellis, "Much I scorn to hear</L>
<L>Thy words of threat, being free from fear;"</L>
<L>With which he hardly could forbear</L>
<L>from laughter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Together then afresh they fly,</L>
<L>The Eel against the Pippin-pie:</L>
<L>But Blany stood there purposely</L>
<L>to watch them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The weapons wherewithal they fought</L>
<L>Were those for which he chiefly sought,</L>
<L>And with an eager stomach thought</L>
<L>to catch them;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But 'scap'd not now so well away</L>
<L>As at the Veal and Mutton fray;</L>
<L>He thought to have with such a prey</L>

<L>But all his hope did turn aside,</L>
<L>He look'd for that which luck deny'd,</L>

<L>Woe was the case he now was in,</L>

<LG>
<L>There stood he in a frightful case:</L>

<L>His hands to feel for Lockwood's guts;</L>
<L>Which came not forth so sweet as nuts,</L>

<LG>
<L>He cries for water. In the mean,</L>
<L>One calls up Madge the Kitchin-quean;</L>
<L>To take and make the baby clean,</L>
<L>and clout it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fast by the nose she took the squall,</L>
<L>And led him softly through the hall,</L>
<L>Lest the perfume through knees should fall</L>

<L>She turn'd his hose beneath the knee,</L>

<L>Either in Bedlam or in Hell,</L>

<L>" By Jove I love thee," Ellis cry'd:</L>

<L>" Thou art, quoth he, a man well try'd:</L>

<L>And then he kneel'd upon the ground,</L>
<L>" Drink 't off, quoth Ellis, for this round</L>

<LG>
<L>May any quarrel 'twixt us twain</L>
<L>Arise, or this renew again,</L>

<L>for ever!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Amen," cry'd the Captain, so did all;</L>

<L>And thus the famous Counter-brawl</L>
<L>was ended.</L>

<L>But hunger now did vex them more</L>
<L>Than all their anger did before;</L>
<L>They search'd i' th' room how far their store</L>
<L>extended.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They want the meat which Blany stole;</L>
<L>One finds a Herring in a hole</L>
<L>With dirt and dust black as a coal,</L>
<L>and trodden</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All under feet. The next in post</L>
<L>Snaps up and feeds on what was lost,</L>
<L>And looks not whether it were roast,</L>
<L>or sodden.</L>
</LG>

<L>A piece of Ling in dirty case,</L>
<L>And Mustard in his fellow's face.</L>
<L>Another</L>

<LG>
<L>Espies, and finds a loaf of bread,</L>
<L>A dish of butter all bespread,</L>
<L>And stuck upon another's head</L>
<L>i' th' pother.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus what they found contented some:</L>
<L>At length the Keeper brings a broom,</L>
<L>Meaning therewith to cleanse the room</L>
<L>with sweeping;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But under table on the ground</L>

<L>He pull'd him out so swift by th' heels,</L>
<L>As if his bum had run on wheels,</L>
<L>And found his pocket stuff'd with Eels:</L>
<L>his ********</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Did plenty of provision bring,</L>
<L>Somewhat it held of every thing,</L>
<L>Smelts, Flounders, Rochets, and of Ling</L>
<L>a broad piece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this discovery each man round</L>
<L>Took equal share of what was found,</L>
<L>Which afterwards they freely drown'd</L>
<L>in good drink.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For of good beer there was good store,</L>
<L>Till all were glad to give it o'er;</L>
<L>For each man had enough and more,</L>
<L>that would drink.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when they thus had drunk and fed,</L>
<L>As if no quarrel had been bred,</L>
<L>They all shook hands, and all to bed</L>
<L>did shuffle.</L>

<P>This Bacchanalian night-prize of the Counter-Scuffle being thus finished, hath ever since frighted both prisoners and gaolers from coming into any room, for fear of a second up∣roar. So that the Counter, for want of sweet garnishing, and cleanly looking to, is grown so nasly that no man (by his good-will) will thrust his nose in at any of the grates: nay,
<PB N="262" REF="265"/>
will rather go a mile about than come near it; though, to keep it sweet, a great deal of mace is stuck upon every ser∣jeant, as if he were a capon in white broth. Upon this sloven∣liness it is woefully haunted with Rats: not such Rats as run up and down in Brew-houses, sucking the new wort of strong beer so long, and in such abundance, that half the city is compelled to drink beer as small as water; nor those Rats which are not mealy-mouth'd in Bake-houses, where they gnaw so many batches of bread, that a penny loaf wants sometimes three or four ounces in weight: and then the honest Baker is blam'd, and curs'd, and (perhaps) innocently set in the pillory. Neither are they those Rats which greaze their throats in Fallow-chandlers shops, where they nibble so much upon candles, that not one pound in an hundred is ever full weight. No, these are no Rats with four legs, but only two; and though they have nests in a thousand places of London, yet for the most part they run but into two Rat∣traps, that is to say, the Counters of Wood-street and the Poultry, and for that cause are called Counter-rats:</P>

CONTAINING A TRUE HISTORY; AND SHEWING THE FOLLY, FOPPERY, LUXURY, LAZINESS, PRIDE, AM∣BITION, AND CONTENTION OF THE ROMISH CLERGY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN CROWNE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A dramatic writer, whose performances both in comedy and tragedy were acted with applause, though comedy seems to have been more peculiarly his talent. Seventeen of his plays are enumerated by Jacob. He was bred under his father, an independent minister in Nova Scotia. Being a man of some genius, and impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country, he resolved upon coming to England, to try if he could not make his fortune by his wits. When he first arrived here, his necessities were ex∣tremely urgent: and he was obliged to become a gentleman-usher to an old Independent lady. But he soon grew as weary of that precise office, as he was of the discipline of Nova Scotia. He set himself therefore to writing; and presently made himself so known to the court and town, that he was no∣minated by Charles II. to write "The Masque of Calypso." This nomination was procured him by the earl of Rochester: it must not however be ascribed entirely to his merit, but to some little spite in this lord, who designed by that pre∣ference to mortify Mr. Dryden. Upon the breaking-out of the two parties, after the pretended discovery of the Popish plot, the favour Crowne was in at court induced him to embrace the Tory party; about which time he wrote a comedy called "The City Politicks," in order to satirize and expose the Whigs. This comedy was by many intrigues of the party-men hindered from appearing upon the stage, till the king himself laid his absolute commands on the lord cham∣berlain to have it acted immediately. About the latter end of this reign, Crowne, tired out with writing, and desirous to shelter himself from the resentment of many enemies he had made by his "City Politicks," ventured to address the king himself, for an establishment in some office that might be a security to him for life. The king answered,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he should be provided for;"</Q>
but added,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he would first see another comedy."</Q>
Mr. Crowne endeavoured to excuse himself, by telling the king, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he plotted slowly and aukwardly."</Q>
His majesty replied, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he would help him to a plot;"</Q>
and so put into his hand the Spanish comedy, called "Non pued esser," out of which Mr. Crowne took the comedy of "Sir Courtly Nice" The play was just ready to appear to the world; and Mr. Crowne extremely delighted to think that he was going to be made happy the remaining part of his life, by the performance of the king's promise. But, upon the last day of the rehearsal, he met Underhill the player coming from the house as he was going to it; upon which, reprimanding him for neglecting so considerable a part as he had in the comedy, and upon the last day too;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord, Sir, says Underhill, we are all un∣done."
— "How! says Crowne, is the playhouse on fire?"
"The whole nation, replies the player, will quickly be so, for the king is dead."</Q>
The king's death ruined Crowne, who had now nothing but his wits to live on for the re∣maining part of his life. It is not certain when he died, but it is supposed to be somewhere about the year 1703. See Dennis's Letters, 1721, vol. I. p. 48. and the Biographical Dictionary, 8vo. Mr. Crowne was author of two other poems, called "Pandion and Amphiginia," and "Daeneids." N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TO JOHN EARL OF MULGRAVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE long been ashamed to see so many of my writings march into the world, and yet, not one of them honoured by your lordship's patronage. It is an easy matter for a troop to force themselves on ladies and
<PB N="281" REF="284"/>
neutral gentlemen, or nobility, who will not arm; but they must be men of some merit and gallantry, who compel regard from a General. Your lordship is as much above us in our own ways, as you are in other respects; and I give this manifest proof of it: your fortune, and, most men believe, your inclination, fixes you on the top of ease and pleasure; therefore you would never have written one line, if it had cost you any pains: yet have you performed masteries, which we, who
<PB N="282" REF="285"/>
make poetry the whole business of our lives, could never equal. In your Essay on Poetry there appears to me a commanding genius standing on a rise, over-looking the age you live in, seeing all the writers in it marching below you, and too often disorderly; and you give us those orders which plainly shew, Poetry attends on you, you may do what you please with it; but we, compared with your lordship, are but poor drudges to it, that have oftener the will than the power to do well. Your lordship has not only a perfect understanding of what is fit to pass in the world, but you are of a severe temper, which will not give your pass to any false sense; the absence therefore of your name from my writings seems a silent charge against me of want of merit. To remove that reproach, I take this occasion to tell the world, your lordship has approved of some of my writings; and I have longed to make my brags of it, but have been hindered either by the unkindness of for∣tune, which has given me some blow, and made me unfit to appear before you, or by the kindness of some generous persons, by which my writings have been in a manner mortgaged. Though the law of the land does not reckon favour freely bestowed among debts, the law of gratitude does; whenever a man is obliged, a judgement is entered against him. In the late reign, when your lordship graced the Lord Chamberlain's office, you were pleased to shew me those regards which made me vain: and I was very desirous to make it known to the world, but the cloudiness of those times got I think into my head, I did not write so well as I
<PB N="283" REF="286"/>
have done formerly. Now I venture before your lord∣ship, because I bring an acquaintance of yours, I am sure you value, Mr. Boileau; and a piece of his all men of sense have esteemed, because it exposes to con∣tempt men who are the antipodes to good sense; priests who advance nonsense above reason, make trifles of the most solemn matters, and solemn things of trifles, are idle in the great affairs of their calling, and busy in impertinence. By the few we have had amongst us of such kind of Churchmen, we may guess the misery of the people who live in the Roman Church, where there are scarce any other; where the whole mass of priest∣hood is a heap of proud flesh, and all the strength and nutriment of a nation goes to feed ecclesiastical cor∣ruption; thanks be to God, we are in a condition to make sport with them; if ever they come amongst us, they will spoil the jest. And, past dispute, it is very fit to render men contemptible who endeavour to make Re∣ligion so. We have had too many in our Church who have busied themselves, and embroiled others about things which the French have had the understanding to know were only fit for a droll. But now we have greater affairs on our hand. We have not time to con∣tend for modes in Religion, when the Being of the Pro∣testant Religion, and indeed the English Nation, lies at stake. In a calm at sea, men may have leisure to wrangle at Chess; but, if a storm arises, the quarrel is at an end, and the bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns, that bred it, are left to shift for themselves. I am well assured the Lutrin pleases your lordship, but I may doubt of
<PB N="284" REF="287"/>
my management of it; for I treat it as an English pri∣vateer would do a French prize, great part of it I sling away, and I dash, brew, and disguise, the rest as I think good. I shall not value how the world censures me, if I have the good-fortune to be approved of by your lordship, and thought worthy of the title of, my Lord,</P>
<P>Your lordship's most humble and obliged servant,</P>

<L>I SING of Angels—not the heavenly Choir,</L>
<L>Whom Peace and Truth, and Harmony inspire.</L>
<L>Hoarse brazen trumpet-like is my rough voice,</L>
<L>Jarring Church-Angels, therefore, are my choice.</L>
<L>In mighty Paris two great spirits reign'd,</L>
<L>Where one with ease could not be well contain'd.</L>
<L>They strove, and from them dreadful thunders broke,</L>
<L>Which made great Notre-Dame both shake and smoke:</L>
<L>And, ere the almost falling Church could fix,</L>
<L>Strange janglings made, among Church-candlesticks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all the Priests that wealthy Dome supply'd</L>
<L>With laziness, with luxury, and pride,</L>
<L>None deeper sunk, or firmlier remain'd</L>
<L>In peace and fat, than he who o'er it reign'd,</L>
<L>The Dean; a solid Priest in flesh and bone;</L>
<L>He like a sleepy Roller trundled on</L>
<L>Along all times; and gather'd as he roll'd</L>
<L>A heavy heap of fat and clammy mold.</L>
<L><PB N="285" REF="288"/>He never knew when changes went or came,</L>
<L>All Times, Faiths, Oaths, appear'd to him the same.</L>
<L>He had no palate but for Meats and Wine,</L>
<L>In those he was a learn'd profound Divine;</L>
<L>And to those studies kept so close and hard,</L>
<L>To his Cathedral he paid small regard.</L>
<L>Mean-while a haughty, melancholy, sour,</L>
<L>Old busy snarling Chanter steep'd in power:</L>
<L>Chief of the Chanters there he was by right;</L>
<L>But, not contented with that noble height,</L>
<L>Usurp'd the Dean's supremacy, and, more,</L>
<L>Took high prerogatives unknown before,</L>
<L>As scorning power only at second-hand;</L>
<L>And he was terrible in his command;</L>
<L>He made the Singers shake more than in song,</L>
<L>This fierce Usurper rul'd in quiet long,</L>
<L>Obey'd, fear'd, honour'd, Church-affairs went on</L>
<L>In a profound still current, cross'd by none.</L>
<L>At length the Dean from his long slumbers woke,</L>
<L>Burst through his cloud, and Church repose he broke.</L>
<L>He saw his reverence and state were gone,</L>
<L>And gallantly resolv'd to seize his own;</L>
<L>Nay his prelatic legal pomp advance</L>
<L>On the intruding Chanter's arrogance.</L>
<L>The great soul'd Chanter having proudly reign'd,</L>
<L>Submission scorn'd, and usurp'd state maintain'd.</L>
<L>By his devotion to pomp, power, and pride,</L>
<L>He won the zealous Canons to his side;</L>
<L>Who, skill'd in causes of that mighty weight,</L>
<L>Lent him their aid by many a loud debate:</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="289"/>So, of old, Pagan Prelates madly strove</L>
<L>The Moon's eclipse by noises to remove:</L>
<L>Pagans beat dishes, pans, and platters hard,</L>
<L>Our Priests no chattering in quotations spar'd.</L>
<L>What Devil, envious of Church repose,</L>
<L>These fire-balls into holy bosoms throws,</L>
<L>And turns the Church to a disorder'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out?</L>
<L>How can such fury enter souls devout?</L>
<L>Stand off, Atheistic Wits, and Scoffers vain,</L>
<L>Do not my grave and solemn song prophane:</L>
<L>Great Notre-Dame, the high and stately scene</L>
<L>Of our ensuing story, long had been</L>
<L>Adorn'd and blest with many a deep Divine,</L>
<L>Not deep in arts, but in down-beds and wine.</L>
<L>Their great devotion doubly they exprest;</L>
<L>In Church by pomp, at home by heavenly rest.</L>
<L>It grac'd their Master's service, to maintain</L>
<L>In ease themselves his favorite Gentlemen.</L>
<L>On their soft beds the morn they dos'd away,</L>
<L>And left the Choir the drudgery to pray;</L>
<L>And to rich lofty cushions to supply</L>
<L>Ther rooms in Church, and raise God's honour high</L>
<L>God was well serv'd, though Priests were never there:</L>
<L>Bright Residentiaries the cushions were.</L>
<L>The holy men eat, drank, and slept with zeal,</L>
<L>All for Heaven's honour, and the Church's weal:</L>
<L>Kept from themselves all sacrilegious toil;</L>
<L>True to their fat they were, as Rhemes to oil,</L>
<L>To anoint Gallic Kings an Angel brought</L>
<L>Much unctuous fat God sent his holy lot,</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="290"/>Our pious Canons, which to keep from waste</L>
<L>Careful they were, not to preach, pray, or fast;</L>
<L>Or only fast to give themselves a whet,</L>
<L>So when they charg'd, the rout was dreadful great.</L>
<L>Sometimes soul-lulling Sermons from them stream'd;</L>
<L>But ah! so gently, when they preach'd they seem'd</L>
<L>Like Halcyons brooding o'er a slumbering wave,</L>
<L>To the Cathedral peaceful calms they gave.</L>
<L>No croaking Preacher spoil'd, with tedious din,</L>
<L>Good Sunday dinners, or sweet weekly Sin.</L>
<L>No noise was there but of harmonious sound,</L>
<L>Division there only in song was found.</L>
<L>When horrid Discord rear'd her snaky head,</L>
<L>To see who entertain'd a calm so dead,</L>
<L>So loath'd by her. Her Empire she survey'd,</L>
<L>And found her will by millions was obey'd.</L>
<L>Gladly she saw in each well-govern'd state</L>
<L>The law with formal pomp support debate;</L>
<L>But Churches highly pleas'd her ear and eye,</L>
<L>She saw all Churches set her honour high.</L>
<L>Yet our Cathedral, only in Music loud,</L>
<L>Lodg'd Peace in scorn of Discord and her crowd.</L>
<L>Discord in rage perch'd on the lofty dome,</L>
<L>And from her mouth she rain'd a poisonous foam,</L>
<L>Which crack'd the glass; martyr'd th' Apostles there;</L>
<L>Then with a sigh, which made trees shed their hair,</L>
<L>Foul'd the Church-plate, that all its splendors died,</L>
<L>Like men in damps; she vented thus her pride:</L>
<L>" How dar'st thou, proud Cathedral, friendship shew</L>
<L>To Peace, (said she) my known and vanquish'd foe,</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="291"/>Which round the world I 've spurn'd? Where has she rest?</L>
<L>In one fair Realm she'as scarce one single breast.</L>

<L>Whig, Tory, Williamite, and Jacobite,</L>
<L>Who have by turns the better of the fray;</L>
<L>As French or Irish get or lose the day;</L>
<L>Or, as the hands of their good Moses rise,</L>
<L>Well to reward, or sharply to chastise.</L>
<L>I 've made myself a barricado strong</L>
<L>Of stiff Non-swearers, a most stubborn throng,</L>

<L>Most true to Discord; he wag'd endless war</L>
<L>With Peace, in presses, pulpits, at the bar,</L>
<L>All bars of civil and of canon laws,</L>
<L>To law he went, with or without a cause.</L>
<L>With suits at law all his tithe-corn he ground,</L>

<L>When his thin flock by winter winds were flea'd,</L>

<L><PB N="292" REF="295"/>" What fury's this, said he, has seiz'd your mind,</L>
<L>And hurries you to Church before you've din'd?</L>
<L>Oft have you left the work of saving fouls,</L>
<L>To sport some hours at tables, chess, or bowls,</L>
<L>But for the Church ne'er dinner left till now;</L>
<L>The dresser-board is ready for the blow.</L>
<L>Your cook now foams, and so does your pot-táge,</L>
<L>With your judicious palate to engage.</L>
<L>And if your roast-meats you compel to stay,</L>
<L>Sir, they will weep their gravy all away.</L>
<L>Your haut-gousts, now most vigorous and strong,</L>
<L>Will sicken if in cold they tarry long,</L>
<L>And never be reviv'd by second heat:</L>
<L>Sir, if you go, you'll murder all your meat.</L>
<L>It is not Lent; say 'twere, it seems a waste</L>
<L>Of holiness in holy men to fast.</L>
<L>Your tongues and pens support Church rites and laws,</L>
<L>What need y' engage your bowels in the cause?</L>
<L>Sure 'twas the Church's motherly intent,</L>
<L>Lent should keep Prelates, and not Prelates Lent.</L>
<L>Religiously support your high degree,</L>
<L>Do not by toil debase your dignity."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This said, he wisely cover'd all the cloth</L>
<L>With crowds of dishes, and a flood of broth.</L>
<L>Much on the pious Dean this vision wrought;</L>
<L>His cloth a while St. Peter's sheet he thought;</L>
<L>A treat let down from Heaven in a dream,</L>
<L>Till his pleas'd nostrils felt th' inviting steam.</L>
<L>Then fiercely he apply'd himself to eat,</L>
<L>And found it more than visionary meat.</L>
<L><PB N="293" REF="296"/>Fast o'er the tongue he turn'd his morsels all;</L>
<L>Like morning-collects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a festival;</L>
<L>Himself he almost choak'd, but not his wroth,</L>
<L>He champ'd his words and meat confusedly both.</L>
<L>He skipt from dish to dish, he knew not why,</L>
<L>No order minded, nor sweet decency.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Steward thought his Master's end was near,</L>
<L>He knew not creatures which he lov'd so dear;</L>
<L>And in great sorrow was about to run</L>
<L>To summon friends; but Fame that work had done.</L>
<L>They scattering came like troops of daunted cranes,</L>
<L>When the proud pigmy a recruit obtains.</L>
<L>The visit rais'd the Prelate from despair,</L>
<L>Chac'd from his visage the late furious air.</L>
<L>So pleas'd he was with the respect they shew'd,</L>
<L>That he vouchsaf'd to rise, nay more, he bow'd:</L>
<L>Commanded the Westphalia-ham again,</L>
<L>Fill'd wine himself to honour the good men,</L>
<L>Drank first and largely; the example pleas'd,</L>
<L>And strait a flaggon of its load was eas'd.</L>
<L>He kindly mov'd them then to take a part</L>
<L>Of what remain'd, and of a fair desert;</L>
<L>The table clear, out burst his inward pain;</L>
<L>" Dear friends, said he, by whose support I reign,</L>
<L>Myself your charitable work I own,</L>
<L>Which the proud Chanter thinks to tumble down;</L>
<L>At least, by interposing in my rights,</L>
<L>To make me useless, and blind up my lights.</L>
<L>To him do all Church-officers repair;</L>
<L>At his command the Sexton rings to prayer.</L>
<L><PB N="294" REF="297"/>Chapters are held at his usurping call;</L>
<L>What need of Deans, if Chanters can do all?"</L>
<L>But then tears stopt the current of his talk:</L>
<L>His loving Steward empower'd his tongue to walk</L>
<L>With chearful wine, when Bovrude, bending low</L>
<L>With heavy age, with trembling steps and slow,</L>
<L>Enter'd the room. The Church had us'd his pains</L>
<L>In four successive Deans voluptuous reigns.</L>
<L>None in Church-customs was so skill'd as he;</L>
<L>He was a living true Church-history.</L>
<L>His knowledge rais'd him from a Sexton poor,</L>
<L>To the high trust of all Church-garniture.</L>
<L>Great office! Robes are often half the Dean:</L>
<L>This rules those Robes, ordains them to be clean.</L>
<L>One in this office half a Dean ordains,</L>
<L>O'er half a Dean as Dean he proudly reigns.</L>
<L>He has in part an arch-prelatic power;</L>
<L>He 's of one college parcel-visitour.</L>
<L>At first approach, the Reverend Sage espies</L>
<L>The Dean's demolish'd pride and groveling eyes.</L>
<L>Guessing the cause, he smiling tow'rds him mov'd,</L>
<L>And, father-like, his childish grief reprov'd.</L>
<L>" For shame, said he, let the poor Chanter weep,</L>
<L>Your rights and empire study you to keep.</L>
<L>Hark to the counsel Heaven does now inspire;</L>
<L>Where the proud Chanter over-looks the Choir</L>
<L>With frowning arrogance, some ages past,</L>
<L>The Church was shaded with an engine vast,</L>
<L>Desk, throne, or pulpit, call it what you please:</L>
<L>At once it serv'd devotion, pomp, and ease.</L>
<L><PB N="295" REF="298"/>There, thron'd in glory, I have known a Dean,</L>
<L>In vestments rich, on velvet cushions lean.</L>
<L>Prayer-books, embost with gold, before him shone,</L>
<L>Which drew all eyes upon them but his own.</L>
<L>A worm stol'n from a grave the Chanter seem'd,</L>

<L>Shew a Church-spirit, the whole Church confound,</L>

<L>Your dazzling right divine dart at your foe;</L>
<L>Then to the Church in all Church-splendor go;</L>

<L>Then, to out-brave him, disperse blessings round.</L>
<L><PB N="296" REF="299"/>To blast his pride, and shew yourself supreme,</L>
<L>Bless all the Congregation, nay, bless him."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The counsel seem'd to admiration wise;</L>
<L>The Dean in ravishments, with lifted eyes,</L>
<L>Heaven's inspiration most devoutly blest;</L>
<L>But strait a new reflection struck his breast.</L>
<L>" I now have in the Choir a seat, said he.</L>
<L>Cloath'd with rich cushions, crown'd with canopy</L>
<L>On what pretence can I erect this throne?"</L>
<L>Boyrude reply'd, "A most religious one:</L>
<L>Sermons to hear!" Th' assembly trembled all</L>
<L>With horror at the sound fanatical.</L>
<L>The Prelate, hotly fir'd, profanely swore;</L>
<L>And almost call'd for an Inquisitor.</L>
<L>" Dar'st thou, said he, name sermons in my ear?</L>
<L>I 'll be no Dean, ere buy the place so dear.</L>
<L>I 'll rather combat with wild beasts, like Paul,</L>
<L>Or, like Isaiah, be saw'd once for all,</L>
<L>Than weakly be with torturing sermons saw'd,</L>
<L>Postpone my meals, and be with fasting gnaw'd;</L>
<L>Nay more, myself into the toil they 'll fetch,</L>
<L>And I myself shall be oblig'd to preach."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Make potent Prelates preach! the Sage replies,</L>
<L>Pray, by what rule' you are not tongues, but eyes.</L>
<L>Our eyes guide all our limbs, yet keep their ease;</L>
<L>Labour becomes not highest dignities.</L>
<L>Sectaries, like Jews, with wanderings are perplext,</L>

<L>Into a loud applause th' assembly broke,</L>
<L>And thought man never with more wisdom spoke.</L>
<L>All start, of fame to have the greatest share;</L>
<L>But the wise Dean reduc'd them as they were.</L>
<L>" All things in Church by order must be done,</L>

<L>None shall approach this work, but those whom Fate</L>

<LG>
<L>Thirty selected names are writ with haste,</L>
<L>And in the bottom of a bonnet cast.</L>
<L>Fairly to draw the billets, they employ</L>
<L>Rosy-cheek'd Will, that pretty Singing-boy;</L>
<L>His head new poll'd, his face and linen clean,</L>
<L>Though no Saint's-day, for much he pleas'd the Dean.</L>
<L>The Prelate all partiality disclaims;</L>
<L>Having thrice blest, as often shakes the names.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="298" REF="301"/>
<L>Will draws, and Trole is the first name that comes:</L>
<L>Birds promis'd good, which freely peck'd their crumbs;</L>
<L>Sure no ill augury could now be read,</L>
<L>This red-beak'd bird from liquor never fled.</L>
<L>A pleasing murmur in the throng was rais'd,</L>
<L>And Fortune's choice by every one was prais'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Will to his office does again repair,</L>
<L>And draws a name, most fatal to the fair,</L>
<L>Of a young Singing-man, whose charms ('tis said)</L>
<L>Had been the death of many a Chamber-maid.</L>
<L>Nay, his keen mounting darts reach'd lofty game,</L>
<L>Threatened high ranks with loss of life or fame.</L>
<L>Whatever beauty ogled him was lost,</L>
<L>And soon became a strumpet, or a ghost.</L>
<L>Yet to the dangerous snare they ventur'd all:</L>
<L>His silver pipe was a true lady-call,</L>
<L>Which both Church-pews and Play-house boxes cram'd,</L>
<L>Entic'd the Fair both to be sav'd and damn'd.</L>
<L>But, oh! that lady gain'd the height of bliss,</L>
<L>Whom he in private taught to sing and kiss.</L>
<L>Long the soft sex did for the youth contend;</L>
<L>Some took their eyes, some money, for their friend.</L>
<L>Some had him all, and some had modest shares,</L>

<L>Shook thy dry corpse, when thy name rose in sight!</L>

<L>NOW Night was in the middle of her reign:</L>
<L>Great was her pomp, and spacious was her train.</L>
<L>From her large throne of jet, she saw the proud</L>
<L>High towers of Paris scorn an humble cloud.</L>
<L>Ravens, and all the prophets of the air,</L>
<L>Nightly to dormitories near repair:</L>
<L>Amongst the rest, for twenty winters foul,</L>
<L>In a dark cave, a Sibyl, call'd an Owl,</L>
<L>Secur'd herself from Day's oppressing light;</L>
<L>And fled abroad, to prophesy at Night.</L>
<L>Of great disasters she has early sense,</L>
<L>Is an impartial true intelligence.</L>
<L>All sects believe her, though she joins with none;</L>
<L>The Schismatick flies all communion.</L>
<L><PB N="300" REF="303"/>Night for her healing touch Nature enthrones,</L>
<L>She often cures both crazy minds and bones.</L>
<L>Kings fall'n with care below e'en common men,</L>
<L>She re-anoints, and makes them kings again.</L>
<L>Day wears, but Night repairs, nay makes mankind,</L>
<L>The only labour to her reign assign'd,</L>
<L>Therefore this Ethiop with Day divides</L>
<L>The rule of time; half through her empire slides.</L>
<L>Angry to see her reign profan'd with toil,</L>
<L>She posted to suppress the noisy broil,</L>
<L>And the bold authors; for the great affair,</L>
<L>She chose this Owl her premier minister,</L>
<L>And call'd her out; her black queen's voice she knew,</L>
<L>To her retinue joyfully she flew.</L>
<L>Both swiftly through th' august Cathedral past,</L>
<L>And found the prison of the engine vast.</L>
<L>It lay neglected in a desert room;</L>
<L>Night plac'd her bird deep in its dusty womb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Trole and Minnum, two great chiefs elect,</L>
<L>Left the Dean's vault, and the slow Verger check'd.</L>
<L>He was as vigorous as they in mind,</L>
<L>But age and gout detain'd him far behind.</L>
<L>Besides, th' old tortoise carried on his back</L>
<L>Of necessary tools a boisterous pack,</L>
<L>As hammer, chissels, mallet, saw, and nails,</L>
<L>Under whose weight his wasted vigour fails.</L>
<L>The warriors force through Night's affrightful shade;</L>
<L>Then valiantly the high proud dome invade.</L>
<L>First they ascend to the magnific porch,</L>
<L>Which stor'd the valued learning of the Church.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="301" REF="304"/>
<L>The Verger stopp'd the troop, whilst, with the dint</L>
<L>Of steel, he cut the veins of stubborn flint,</L>
<L>And forc'd from thence a spark; the infant bright</L>
<L>As soon as born begot another light,</L>
<L>Which proves to them a kind of midnight sun,</L>
<L>By whose direction boldly they go on.</L>
<L>Th' unfolding gates upon the troop let loose</L>
<L>Detested shades, like floods through opening sluice.</L>
<L>Like a bold caravan the stream they stem,</L>
<L>The horrors and the solitude contemn,</L>
<L>So on in wilds where never was a road,</L>
<L>And reach at length the pulpit's dark abode.</L>
<L>Their wonders on the fall'n machine they feast,</L>
<L>Like birds upon the carcass of a beast.</L>
<L>" How now? said Minnum, come we here to gaze?"</L>
<L>And then, ambitious to engross the praise,</L>
<L>With a stiff threatening arm, and bending back,</L>
<L>He singly made a desperate attack.</L>
<L>Ere half his force the engine had receiv'd,</L>
<L>(Astonishing! and scarce to be believ'd)</L>
<L>A horrid voice out of the pulpit flew,</L>
<L>Th' old Verger from his back his burthen threw;</L>
<L>The fire from Trole's flaming visage stray'd,</L>
<L>Only in his nose, as in a socket, play'd.</L>
<L>Pale Minnum like a lily hung his head,</L>
<L>With his lost mistress wish'd himself in bed:</L>
<L>But, fearing shame, he put false courage on,</L>
<L>Seem'd bolder now more danger might be won.</L>
<L>The frightful dangerous engine shook once more,</L>
<L>With greater resolution than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="302" REF="305"/>
<L>The angry Owl, once more depriv'd of ease,</L>
<L>Rushes abroad with greater menaces,</L>
<L>Scattering a storm of wind and dust about,</L>
<L>Which put their candle and their courage out.</L>
<L>Their trembling knees could not their bodies bear;</L>
<L>Their nerves were weaker than their staring hair.</L>
<L>In wild confusion they slunk all away,</L>
<L>Like truants by their whipster catch'd at play.</L>
<L>Discord rag'd at their foil, and, in despight</L>
<L>Of their base fear, will force them to the fight.</L>
<L>In Boyrude's wither'd figure she appears,</L>

<L>Wrinkled, but malice half the cyphers made,</L>
<L>And claim to half his wasted visage laid.</L>
<L>Her bending trunk she with a staff supports,</L>
<L>And hastes to find her warriors' dark resorts.</L>
<L>With broken voice, and hoarse with frequent brawl,</L>
<L>She cries, "Where are you fled, ye cowards all?</L>
<L>Think you, because your odious heads ye hide,</L>
<L>Your infamy more odious is not spy'd?</L>
<L>Come out, and shew the reason of your fear."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stung with reproof, with boldness they appear,</L>
<L>Proud of th' encounter, and prepar'd to boast,</L>
<L>For all of them believ'd the Owl a Ghost.</L>
<L>Minnum was fix'd in the opinion strong;</L>
<L>His charms had kill'd a Sempstress fair and young,</L>
<L>Her heart was crush'd between his voice and face,</L>
<L>The kingdom had not such a dangerous place.</L>
<L>His voice had fix'd her in the fatal snare:</L>
<L>She often came to gaze on him at prayer,</L>
<L><PB N="303" REF="306"/>And, when his eye was from the book releas'd,</L>
<L>He glances shot which pierc'd her tender breast.</L>
<L>At length, alas! she perish'd in the fray,</L>

<L>What shape could more exactly fit her soul,</L>

<L>With these conceits they swelling came, and cram'd;</L>
<L>Minnum for th' Owl a doleful speech had fram'd.</L>
<L>He said, "We saw a Ghost or Goblin foul!"</L>
<L>Reply'd the Goddess, "Goblin! a poor Owl</L>
<L>Drives you from glory by base childish fears,</L>

<L>The sour old man could ne'er with mirth agree,</L>
<L>But now abhorr'd his ill-tim'd raillery:</L>
<L>Forbad him speaking, and from bed he flings.</L>
<L>Gerot, to calm him, his rich habit brings:</L>
<L>Which very little could his mind sustain,</L>
<L>For, if his Desk be hid, all those were vain.</L>
<L>But yet their offer'd grace he will not slight;</L>
<L>He rush'd into his gown, and surplice white.</L>
<L>But, above all, he will not leave behind,</L>
<L>His spacious scarlet hood, with tabby lin'd:</L>
<L>His haughty heart would break, if he should lack</L>
<L>That proof of learning, to adorn his back.</L>
<L>With his best bonnet then he grac'd his brow,</L>
<L>Sole mark of learning his white head could shew,</L>
<L>His purple gloves he never fail'd to wear,</L>
<L>When he would honour much himself and prayer.</L>
<L>And, marching now in battle to engage,</L>
<L>Omitted no illustrious equipage.</L>
<L>Then much beyond the weakness of his years</L>
<L>Push'd on, and earliest in the Choir appears.</L>
<L>But, oh! what spite and fury fir'd his blood,</L>
<L>When on his Bench he saw the Pulpit stood!</L>
<L><PB N="307" REF="310"/>" Oh, Gerot see, said he, the Dragon see,</L>
<L>Which broke my sleep, and now will swallow me.</L>
<L>Oh, faithful Dream! thou too much truth hast shown;</L>
<L>The Dean is an ingenious tyrant grown;</L>
<L>By this machine, does wittily contrive</L>
<L>To send me to infernal shades alive.</L>
<L>Nothing but God will ever see me here;</L>
<L>Dark shadows will expunge my character.</L>
<L>Ere such a horrible affront I'll bear,</L>
<L>I'll quit my office, and the Church forswear;</L>
<L>I'll give my vain superfluous Chantings o'er,</L>
<L>And tire the ears of God and Man no more.</L>
<L>I'll never toil that Deans may glory win,</L>
<L>Nor see that Choir where I shall ne'er be seen.</L>
<L>'Tis time enough to go to shades when dead,</L>
<L>I'll now have light." Then his old arms he spread</L>
<L>With fury strong; and shook the wondrous frame,</L>
<L>When th' Organist and the Clock-mender came,</L>
<L>His faithful friends. The vision struck them wan,</L>
<L>With trembling hands they held th' old venturous man;</L>
<L>Said they, "The work's too weighty for us all;</L>
<L>By a full Chapter let the Monster fall,</L>
<L>In open day; 'twill your great party shew,</L>
<L>Strengthen yourself, and terrify the foe.</L>
<L>" Right," said the Chanter; "go, by noise or force.</L>
<L>The sleeping Canons from their beds divorce."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Champions trembled, when beyond their thought</L>
<L>Their counsel on themselves such danger brought.</L>
<L>" Oh! moderate your anger, Sir! said they.</L>
<L>Awaken rich fat Canons before day?</L>
<L><PB N="308" REF="311"/>Men doubly buried both in flesh and down!</L>
<L>Th' attempt is rare, the deed was never known.</L>
<L>Starv'd Monks a larum in their bosoms keep,</L>
<L>Hunger, a watchful enemy to Sleep.</L>
<L>Their thin-worn wheels are soon in motion set:</L>
<L>But who can stir a Canon mir'd in fat?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Deceitful cowards, th' old testy man reply'd,</L>
<L>You fain your terror of the Dean would hide:</L>
<L>A hundred times I've seen you croüching stand</L>
<L>With servile necks, beneath his blessing hand.</L>
<L>The work, good Gerot, shall by us be done,</L>
<L>Our friends for once shall shame the loitering sun."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cunning old Gerot knew the Canons well,</L>
<L>Spar'd his worn lungs, rung the great master-bell;</L>
<L>Which, like the heavy Dean, but serv'd for state,</L>
<L>And almost broke the Church with needless weight.</L>
<L>Th' unchrist'ned bell, with sacrilegious roar,</L>
<L>From his strong camp the God of slumbers tore;</L>
<L>Broke open all the holy Canons eyes,</L>
<L>And made the Devil of noise and tumult rise.</L>
<L>Some believ'd thunder broke into the room,</L>
<L>Others half fear'd it was the day of doom.</L>
<L>Some Priests, less scar'd, thought 'twas a dying knell;</L>
<L>Some keenly hungry hop'd 'twas Pancake-bell.</L>
<L>The sound with different sense fill'd every head,</L>
<L>Like a dark text, wondrous confusion bred.</L>
<L>So when, to batter down a hundred walls,</L>
<L>The thund'ring Lewis leaves the fair Versailles</L>
<L>To the young Spring, not valuing her delights,</L>
<L>And with spread banners all the world affrights;</L>
<L><PB N="309" REF="312"/>Danow to th' Euxine hastes his march to shun,</L>
<L>Swift Rhine in great commotion hurries-on,</L>
<L>Brussels for bursting bombs looks every hour,</L>
<L>And Sodom-like to feel a fiery shower.</L>
<L>Rich skirted Tagus creeps far under ground,</L>
<L>And hides much treasure there in vaults profound.</L>
<L>Amphibious Holland plunges deep in waves,</L>
<L>Buries itself alive in watery graves.</L>
<L>So under blankets the priests duck'd their heads,</L>
<L>Sought a warm easy burial in their beds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vexatious Gerot knew their temper well:</L>
<L>With potent words he seconded the bell.</L>
<L>" Ho, breakfast waits!" the cunning Verger cries.</L>
<L>At that angelic summons, all arise:</L>
<L>In expectations of divine delights,</L>
<L>All look their cloaths, but none their appetites,</L>
<L>For they were ready, ere their gowns were on:</L>
<L>Headlong undrest to the great hall they run:</L>
<L>But, 'stead of breakfast, met a mournful tale,</L>
<L>Told by the Chanter with great fury pale;</L>
<L>Who, as a pestilence were in his breath,</L>
<L>Struck mighty hunger with a sudden death.</L>
<L>Everard a painful abstinence abhorr'd,</L>
<L>And bad the Verger cover strait the board.</L>
<L>To that once savoury motion no man spoke,</L>
<L>At length learn'd Allen the deep silence broke.</L>
<L>He only, of all the Priests our Church obey'd,</L>
<L>Had not his Latin smother'd and o'erlaid.</L>
<L>Others by wealth to dulness did advance,</L>
<L>And with the Church's coin brought ignorance.</L>
<L><PB N="310" REF="313"/>But he had wander'd from that practis'd rule,</L>
<L>And was as learn'd as when he came from school.</L>
<L>His Roman tongue there gave him mighty power,</L>
<L>There he was almost Roman Emperor.</L>
<L>None in his presence durst lay claim to parts,</L>
<L>For, if they did, his Latin stabb'd their hearts.</L>
<L>This tyrant yet was their defence and grace:</L>
<L>Latin was such a terror to the place,</L>
<L>All other Canons fled at first alarms</L>
<L>Of men approaching with such dreadful arms.</L>
<L>But noble Allen scorn'd his head to hide,</L>
<L>And sturdy shocks of Latin durst abide.</L>
<L>Most learnedly equipp'd, th' accomplish'd man,</L>
<L>Having first cough'd, his wise harangue began:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Some Huguenots, our curst eternal foes,</L>
<L>Planted this here, to batter our repose.</L>
<L>In some Church History they 've read, I fear,</L>
<L>Canons once preach'd, and Deans sat here to hear.</L>
<L>I range in volumes, not to poach for art,</L>
<L>But to meet Latin which delights my heart.</L>
<L>Let us all study with what speed we may,</L>
<L>And shew ourselves as deeply learn'd as they.</L>
<L>About this Pulpit then let 's quickly found</L>
<L>All learned men in these great things profound."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' unlook'd-for counsel all th' assembly scar'd,</L>
<L>But made an earthquake in fat Everard;</L>
<L>Who shaking with astonishment and rage,</L>
<L>" How I, said he, turn school-boy in my age!</L>
<L>Do thou look pale, and wither o'er a book,</L>
<L>I ne'er so much as on the Bible look.</L>
<L><PB N="311" REF="314"/>I only study when our rents are due,</L>
<L>When leases fall, and tenants should renew.</L>
<L>Books I abhor; they fill the Church with Schisms;</L>
<L>Much mischief we have had from Syllogisms.</L>
<L>If to Religion you would converts make,</L>
<L>Burn Books and Men, say I, and use a stake.</L>
<L>I will not vex my head: my arm alone</L>
<L>Shall, without Latin, throw this Pulpit down.</L>
<L>I care not what Heretic Rascals say:</L>
<L>What troubles me, I 'll throw out of my way.</L>
<L>So let's prepare for the renown'd design,</L>
<L>And, when accomplish'd, plentifully dine."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No sooner the word Dinner pass'd their ears,</L>
<L>Than up their stomachs rose, down fell their fears,</L>
<L>But then the Chanter, none more bold and great,</L>
<L>Exclaim'd, "This Tub too long has made us sweat.</L>
<L>Do Deans fear dust? must they be cas'd like clocks?</L>
<L>Would they like sentries awe us from a box?</L>
<L>In our Church-pillar is some rottenness spread:</L>
<L>To hide himself, he would be wainscoted.</L>
<L>My vengeance on this soppery I'll throw;</L>
<L>And an hour's fasting on the work bestow.</L>
<L>This done, at once we 'll break our fast, and dine,</L>
<L>And two fair meals with both their portions join."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By this inspir'd, the haughty Champions go</L>
<L>With an audacious zeal to charge the foe.</L>
<L>The walls vain aid to the poor Engine lent,</L>
<L>The nails in vain their iron fingers bent;</L>
<L>The Champions vanquish'd all resistance round,</L>
<L>The batter'd Engine fell with many a wound.</L>
<L><PB N="312" REF="315"/>Antichrist never had such dreadful blows</L>
<L>From mighty Priests who were his bitter foes:</L>
<L>For, as this Pulpit was, he 's wondrous high,</L>
<L>A great Usurper of Church-vanity.</L>
<L>Therefore have many rail'd at him aloud;</L>
<L>He will let no man but himself be proud.</L>
<L>Now the Dean's State, of late so high and great,</L>
<L>Once more is in a sea of darkness set!</L>
