<L>SWEET are yon Hills, that crown this fertile Vale!</L>
<L>Ye genial Springs! PIERIAN Waters, hail!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, Woods and Lawns! Yes—oft I'll tread</L>
<L>Yon' Pine-clad Mountain's Side,</L>
<L>Oft trace the gay enamel'd Mead,</L>
<L>Where AVON rolls his Pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sure, next to fair CASTALIA's Streams</L>
<L>And PINDUS' flow'ry Path,</L>

<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>The Muses haunt these hallow'd Groves</L>
<L>And here their Vigils keep,</L>
<L>Here teach fond Swains their hapless Loves</L>
<L>In gentle Strains to weep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Water sprung like Flow'rs from Dew</L>
<L>What Troops of Bards appear!</L>
<L>The God of Verse, and Physic too,</L>
<L>Inspires them twice a Year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take then, my Friend, the sprightly Rhyme,</L>
<L>While you inglorious waste your Prime,</L>
<L>At Home in cruel Durance pent,</L>
<L>On dull domestic Cares intent,</L>
<L>Forbid, by Parent's harsh Decree,</L>
<L>To share the Joys of <HI>Bath</HI> with me.</L>
<L>Ill-judging Parent! blind to Merit,</L>
<L>Thus to confine a Nymph of Spirit!</L>
<L>With all thy Talents doom'd to fade</L>
<L>And wither in th' unconscious Shade!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>I vow, my Dear, it moves my Spleen,</L>
<L>Such frequent Instances I've seen</L>
<L>Of Fathers, cruel and unkind,</L>
<L>To all paternal Duty blind.</L>
<L>What Wretches do we meet with often,</L>
<L>Whose Hearts no Tenderness can soften!</L>
<L>Sure all good Authors should expose</L>
<L>Such Parents, both in Verse and Prose,</L>
<L>And Nymphs inspire with Resolution,</L>
<L>Ne'er to submit to Persecution.</L>
<L>This wholesome Satyr much enhances</L>
<L>The Merit of our best Romances;</L>
<L>And modern Plays, that I could mention,</L>
<L>With Judgment fraught, and rare Invention</L>
<L>Are wrote with much the same Intention;</L>
<L>But, thank my Stars! that worthy Pair</L>
<L>Who undertook a Guardian's Care,</L>
<L>My Spirit never have confin'd:</L>
<L>(An Instance of their gen'rous Mind)</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>For Lady B—N—R—D, my Aunt,</L>
<L>Herself propos'd this charming Jaunt,</L>
<L>All from Redundancy of Care</L>
<L>For SIM, her fav'rite Son and Heir:</L>
<L>To him the joyous Hours I owe</L>
<L>That <HI>Bath</HI>'s enchanting Scenes bestow;</L>
<L>Thanks to her Book of choice Receipts,</L>
<L>That pamper'd Him with sav'ry Meats;</L>
<L>Nor less that Day deserves a Blessing</L>
<L>She cramm'd his Sister to Excess in:</L>
<L>For now she sends both Son and Daughter</L>
<L>For Crudities to drink the Water.</L>
<L>And here they are, all Bile and Spleen,</L>
<L>The strangest Fish that e'er were seen;</L>
<L>With TABBY RUNT, their Maid, poor Creature,</L>
<L>The queerest Animal in Nature:</L>
<L>I'm certain none of HOGARTH's Sketches</L>
<L>E'er form'd a Set of stranger Wretches.</L>
<L>I own, my Dear, it hurts my Pride,</L>
<L>To see them blund'ring by my Side;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>My Spirits flag, my Life and Fire</L>
<L>Is mortify'd <HI>au Desespoir,</HI></L>
<L>When SIM, unfashionable Ninny,</L>
<L>In Public calls me <HI>Cousin Jenny;</HI></L>
<L>And yet, to give the Wight his Due,</L>
<L>He has some Share of Humour too,</L>
<L>A comic Vein of pedant Learning</L>
<L>His Conversation you'll discern in,</L>
<L>The oddest Compound you can see</L>
<L>Of Shrewdness and Simplicity,</L>
<L>With nat'ral Strokes of aukward Wit,</L>
<L>That oft, like Parthian Arrows hit,</L>
<L>For when He seems to dread the Foe</L>
<L>He always strikes the hardest Blow;</L>
<L>And when you'd think He means to flatter,</L>
<L>His Panegyrics turn to Satire:</L>
<L>But then no Creature you can find</L>
<L>Knows half so little of Mankind,</L>
<L>Seems always blund'ring in the dark,</L>
<L>And always making some Remark;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>Remarks, that so provoke one's Laughter,</L>
<L>One can't imagine what he's after:</L>
<L>And sure you'll thank me for exciting</L>
<L>In SIM a wondrous Itch for Writing;</L>
<L>With all his serious Grimace</L>
<L>To give Descriptions of the Place.</L>
<L>No Doubt his Mother will produce</L>
<L>His Poetry for gen'ral Use,</L>
<L>And if his Bluntness does not fright you,</L>
<L>His Observations must delight you;</L>
<L>For truly the good Creature's Mind</L>
<L>Is honest, generous, and kind:</L>
<L>If unprovok'd, will ne'er displease ye,</L>
<L>Or ever make one Soul uneasy.—</L>
<L>I'll try to make his Sister PRUE</L>
<L>Take a small Trip to <HI>Pindus</HI> too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And me the Nine shall all inspire</L>
<L>To tune for Thee the warbling Lyre;</L>
<L>For Thee, the Muse shall ev'ry Day</L>
<L>Speed, by the Post, her rapid Way.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>For Thee, my Friend, I'll oft explore</L>
<L>Deep Treasures of Romantic Lore,</L>
<L>Nor wonder, if I Gods create,</L>
<L>As all good Bards have done of late;</L>
<L>'Twill make my Verse run smooth and even,</L>
<L>To call new Deities from Heaven:</L>
<L>Come then, thou Goddess I adore,</L>

<LG>
<L>WE all are a wonderful Distance from Home!</L>
<L>Two Hundred and Sixty long Miles are we come!</L>
<L>And sure you'll rejoice, my dear Mother, to hear</L>
<L>We are safely arriv'd at the Sign of the Bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis a plaguy long Way!—but I ne'er can repine,</L>
<L>As my Stomach is weak, and my Spirits decline:</L>
<L>For the People say here,—be whatever your Case,</L>
<L>You are sure to get well, if you come to this Place.—</L>
<L>Miss JENNY made Fun, as she always is wont,</L>
<L>Of PRUDENCE my Sister, and TABITHA RUNT,</L>
<L>And every Moment she heard me complain,</L>
<L>Declar'd I was vapour'd, and laugh'd at my Pain.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>What, tho' at <HI>Devizes</HI> I fed pretty hearty,</L>
<L>And made a good Meal, like the rest of the Party,</L>
<L>When I came here to <HI>Bath,</HI> not a Bit could I eat,</L>
<L>Though the Man at the Bear had provided a Treat,</L>
<L>And so I went quite out of Spirits to Bed,</L>
<L>With Wind in my Stomach, and Noise in my Head.</L>
<L>As we all came for Health, (as a Body may say)</L>
<L>I sent for the Doctor the very next Day,</L>
<L>And the Doctor was pleas'd, tho' so short was the Warning,</L>
<L>To come to our Lodgings betimes in the Morning▪</L>
<L>He look'd very thoughtful and grave, to be sure,</L>
<L>And I said to myself,—There's no Hopes of a Cure!</L>
<L>But I thought I should faint when I saw him, dear Mother,</L>
<L>Feel my Pulse with one Hand, with a Watch in the other,</L>
<L>No Token of Death that is heard in the Night</L>
<L>Could ever have put me so much in a Fright,</L>
<L>Thinks I—'tis all over—my Sentence is past!</L>
<L>And now He is counting how long I may last.—</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>Then He look'd at—and His Face grew so long,</L>
<L>I'm sure He thought something within me was wrong.—</L>
<L>He determin'd our Cases at length (G-d preserve us)</L>
<L>I'm Bilious, I find, and the Women are Nervous;</L>
<L>Their Systems relax'd, and all turn'd topsy-turvy,</L>
<L>With Hypochondriacs, Obstructions, and Scurvy:</L>
<L>And these are Distempers He must know the whole on,</L>
<L>For He talk'd of the Peritoneum and Colon,</L>
<L>Of Phleghmatic Humours oppressing the Women</L>
<L>From soeculent Matter that swells the Abdomen;</L>
<L>But the Noise I have heard in my Bowels like Thunder</L>
<L>Is a Flatus, I find, in my left Hypochonder.</L>
<L>So Plenty of Med'cines each Day does He send</L>
<L><HI>Post singulas liquidas Sedes sumend'</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ad Crepitus Vesper: &amp; Man: promovend'</HI></L>
<L>In English to say, we must swallow a Potion</L>
<L>For driving out Wind after every Motion;</L>
<L>The same to continue for Three Weeks at least,</L>
<L>Before we may venture the Waters to taste.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>Five Times have I purg'd,—yet I'm sorry to tell ye</L>
<L>I find the same Gnawing and Wind in my Belly;</L>
<L>But, without any Doubt, I shall find myself stronger,</L>
<L>When I've took the same Physic a Week or two longer.</L>
<L>He gives little TABBY a great many Doses,</L>
<L>For he says the poor Creature has got the Chlorosis,</L>
<L>Or a ravenous Pica, so brought on the Vapours</L>
<L>By swallowing Stuff she has read in the Papers,</L>
<L>And often I've marvel'd she spent so much Money</L>
<L>In Water-Dock Essence, and Balsam of Honey;</L>
<L>Such Tinctures, Elixirs, such Pills have I seen,</L>
<L>I never could wonder her Face was so green.</L>
<L>Yet He thinks He can very soon set Her to right</L>
<L>With <HI>Testic: Equin:</HI> that she takes ev'ry Night;</L>
<L>And when to her Spirits and Strength He has brought her,</L>
<L>He thinks she may venture to bathe in the <HI>Water.</HI>—</L>
<L>But PRUDENCE is forc'd ev'ry Day to ride out,</L>
<L>For he says she wants thoroughly jumbling about.</L>
<L>Now it happens in this very House is a Lodger,</L>
<L>Whose Name's NICODEMUS, but some call him ROGER:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>And ROGER's so good as my Sister to bump</L>
<L>On a Pillion, as soon as she comes from the Pump;</L>
<L>He's a pious good Man, and an excellent Scholar,</L>
<L>And I think it is certain no Harm can befall Her,</L>
<L>For ROGER is constantly saying his Pray'rs,</L>
<L>And singing of spiritual Hymns on the Stairs.</L>
<L>But my Cousin Miss JENNY's as fresh as a Rose,</L>
<L>And the Captain attends Her wherever she goes:</L>
<L>The Captain's a <HI>worthy good Sort of a Man,</HI></L>
<L>For He calls in upon us whenever He can,</L>
<L>And often a Dinner or Supper He takes here,</L>
<L>And JENNY and He talk of MILTON and SHAKESPEAR,</L>
<L>For the Life of me now I can't think of his Name,</L>
<L>But we all got acquainted as soon as we came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Don't wonder, dear Mother, in Verse I have writ,</L>
<L>For JENNY declares I've a good pretty Wit;</L>
<L>She says that she frequently sends a few Verses</L>
<L>To Friends and Acquaintance, and often rehearses:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16"/>Declares 'tis the Fashion, and all the World knows</L>
<L>There's nothing so filthy, so vulgar as Prose.</L>
<L>And I hope, as I write without any Connection,</L>
<L>I shall make a great Figure in DODSLEY's Collection;</L>
<L>At least, when he chooses his Book to encrease,</L>
<L>I may take a small Flight, as a <HI>fugitive Piece.—</HI></L>
<L>But now, my dear Mother, I'm quite at a Stand,</L>

<L>DEAR Mother, my Time has been wretchedly spent</L>
<L>With a Gripe or a Hickup wherever I went,</L>
<L>My Stomach all swell'd, till I thought it would burst,</L>
<L>Sure never poor Mortal with Wind was so curst!</L>
<L>If ever I ate a good Supper at Night,</L>
<L>I dream'd of the Devil, and wak'd in a Fright:</L>
<L>And so as I grew ev'ry Day worse and worse,</L>
<L>The Doctor advis'd me to send for a Nurse;</L>
<L>And the Nurse was so willing my Health to restore,</L>
<L>She beg'd me to send for a few Doctors more;</L>
<L>For when any difficult Work's to be done,</L>
<L>Many Heads can dispatch it much sooner than one;</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="25"/>And I find there are Doctors enough at this Place,</L>
<L>If you want to consult in a dangerous Case.</L>
<L>So they all met together, and thus began talking:</L>
<L>"Good Doctor, I'm your's—'tis a fine Day for walking—</L>
<L>"Sad News in the Papers—G-d knows who's to blame—</L>
<L>"The Colonies seem to be all in a Flame—</L>
<L>"This Stamp-Act, no doubt, might be good for the Crown—</L>
<L>"But I sear 'tis a Pill that will never go down—</L>
<L>"What can <HI>Portugal</HI> mean?—is <HI>She</HI> going to stir up</L>
<L>"Convulsions and Heats in the Bowels of <HI>Europe?</HI></L>
<L>"'Twill be fatal if <HI>England</HI> relapses again</L>
<L>"From the ill Blood and Humours of <HI>Bourbon</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI>"—</L>
<L>Says I, my good Doctors, I can't understand</L>
<L>Why the Deuce ye take so many Patients in Hand,</L>
<L>Ye've a great deal of Practice, as far as I find;</L>
<L>But since ye're come hither, do pray be so kind</L>
<L>To write me down something that's good for the Wind.</L>
<L>No Doubt ye are all of ye great Politicians,</L>
<L>But at present <HI>my Bowels</HI> have need of Physicians:</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="26"/>Consider my Case in the Light it deserves,</L>
<L>And pity the State of my Stomach and Nerves.—</L>
<L>But a tight little Doctor began a Dispute</L>
<L>About Administrations, NEW—LE and B—E,</L>
<L>Talk'd much of Oeconomy, much of Prosuseness.—</L>
<L>Says another— "This Case, which at first was a Looseness,</L>
<L>"Is become a Tenesmus, and all we can do</L>
<L>"Is to give him a gentle Cathartic or two;</L>
<L>"First get off the Phlegm that adheres to the <HI>Plicae,</HI></L>
<L>"Then throw in a Med'cine that's pretty and spicy,—</L>
<L>"A Peppermint Draught,—or a—Come, let's be gone,</L>
<L>"We've another bad Case to consider at One."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So thus they brush'd off, each his Cane at his Nose,</L>
<L>When JENNY came in, who had heard all their Prose:</L>
<L>I'll teach them, says she, at their next Consultation,</L>
<L>To come and take Fees for the Good of the Nation.</L>
<L>I could not conceive what the Devil she mean't,</L>
<L>But she seiz'd all the Stuff that the Doctor had sent,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="27"/>And out of the Window she flung it down souse,</L>
<L>As the first Politician went out of the House.</L>
<L>Decoctions and Syrups around him all flew,</L>
<L>The Pill, Bolus, Julep, and Apozem too;</L>
<L>His Wig had the Luck a Cathartic to meet,</L>
<L>And squash went the Gallipot under his Feet.</L>
<L>She said 'twas a Shame I should swallow such Stuff</L>
<L>When my Bowels were weak, and the Physic so rough;</L>
<L>Declar'd she was shock'd that so many should come</L>
<L>To be Doctor'd to Death, such a Distance from Home,</L>
<L>At a Place where they tell you that Water alone</L>
<L>Can cure all Distempers that ever were known.</L>
<L>But what is the pleasantest Part of the Story,</L>
<L>She has order'd for Dinner a Piper and Dory;</L>
<L>For to-Day Captain CORMORANT's coming to dine,</L>
<L>That worthy Acquaintance of JENNY's and mine.</L>
<L>'Tis a Shame to the Army, that Men of such Spirit</L>
<L>Should never obtain the Reward of their Merit,</L>
<L>For the Captain's as gallant a Man, I'll be sworn,</L>
<L>And as honest a Fellow as ever was born;</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="28"/>After so many Hardships and Dangers incurr'd,</L>
<L>He Himself thinks He ought to be better preferr'd;</L>
<L>And ROGER, or what is his Name, NICODEMUS,</L>
<L>Appears full as kind, and as much to esteem us;</L>
<L>Our PRUDENCE declares he's an excellent Preacher,</L>
<L>And by Night and by Day is so good as to teach her;</L>
<L>His Doctrine so sound with such Spirit he gives,</L>
<L>She ne'er can forget it as long as she lives.</L>
<L>I told you before that He's often so kind</L>
<L>As to go out a riding with PRUDENCE behind,</L>
<L>So frequently dines here without any pressing,</L>
<L>And now to the Fish he is giving his Blessing;</L>
<L>And as that is the Case, tho' I've taken a Griper,</L>
<L>I'll venture to peck at the Dory and Piper.</L>
<L>And now, my dear Mother, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</L>

<HEAD>Mr. S— B—N—R—D, to Lady B—N—R—D, at — Hall, North. <HI>LETTER V.</HI> Salutations of <HI>BATH,</HI> and an Adventure of Mr. <HI>B—N—R—D</HI>'s in Consequence thereof.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NO City, dear Mother, this City excels</L>
<L>For charming sweet Sounds both of Fiddles and Bells;</L>
<L>I thought, like a Fool, that they only would ring</L>
<L>For a Wedding, or Judge, or the Birth of a King;</L>
<L>But I found 'twas for <HI>Me</HI> that the good-natur'd People</L>
<L>Rung so hard that I thought they would pull down the Steeple,</L>
<L>So I took out my Purse, as I hate to be shabby,</L>
<L>And paid all the Men when they came from the Abbey;</L>
<L>Yet some think it strange they should make such a Riot</L>
<L>In a Place where sick Folk would be glad to be quiet,</L>
<L>But I hear 'tis the Business of this Corporation</L>
<L>To welcome in all the <HI>Great</HI> Men of the Nation,</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="30"/>For you know there is nothing diverts or employs</L>
<L>The Minds of <HI>Great</HI> People like making a Noise:</L>
<L>So with Bells they contrive all as much as they can</L>
<L>To tell the Arrival of any such Man.</L>
<L>If a Broker, or Statesman, a Gamester, or Peer,</L>
<L>A nat'raliz'd Jew or a Bishop comes here;</L>
<L>Or <HI>an eminent Trader in Cheese</HI> should retire</L>
<L>Just to think of the Bus'ness the State may require,</L>
<L>With Horns and with Trumpets, with Fiddles and Drums,</L>
<L>They'll strive to divert him as soon as he comes.</L>
<L>'Tis amazing they find such a Number of Ways</L>
<L>Of employing his Thoughts all the Time that he stays;</L>
<L>If by chance the <HI>Great</HI> Man at his Lodging alone is,</L>
<L>He may view from his Window the Colliers Ponies</L>
<L>On both the Parades, where they tumble and kick,</L>
<L>To the great Entertainment of those that are sick:</L>
<L>What a Number of Turnspits and Builders he'll find</L>
<L>For relaxing his Cares, and unbending his Mind,</L>
<L>While Notes of sweet Music contend with the Cries</L>
<L>Of <HI>fine potted Laver, fresh Oysters,</HI> and <HI>Pies!</HI></L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="31"/>And Music's a Thing I shall truly revere,</L>
<L>Since the City-Musicians so tickled my Ear;</L>
<L>For when we arriv'd here at <HI>Bath</HI> t'other Day,</L>
<L>They came to our Lodgings on Purpose to play:</L>
<L>And I thought it was right, as the Music was come,</L>
<L>To foot it a little in TABITHA's Room,</L>
<L>For Practice makes perfect, as often I've read,</L>
<L>And to Heels is of Service as well as the Head;</L>
<L>But the Lodgers were shock'd such a Noise we should make,</L>
<L>And the Ladies declar'd that we kept them awake;</L>
<L>Lord RINGBONE, who lay in the Parlour below,</L>
<L>On Account of the Gout he had got in his Toe,</L>
<L>Began on a sudden to curse and to swear,</L>
<L>I protest, my dear Mother, 'twas shocking to hear</L>
<L>The Oaths of that reprobate gouty old Peer:</L>
<L>"All the Devils in Hell sure at once have concurr'd</L>
<L>"To make such a Noise here as never was heard,</L>
<L>"Some blundering Blockhead, while I am in Bed,</L>
<L>"Treads as hard as a Coach-Horse just over my Head;</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="32"/>"I cannot conceive what a Plague he's about,</L>
<L>"Are the Fidlers come hither to make all this Rout</L>
<L>"With their d-mn'd squeaking Catgut that's worse than the Gout?</L>
<L>"If the Aldermen bad 'em come hither, I swear</L>
<L>"I wish they were broiling in Hell with the May'r;</L>
<L>"May Flames be my Portion if ever I give</L>
<L>"Those Rascals one Farthing as long as I live."—</L>
<L>So while they were playing their musical Airs,</L>
<L>And I was just dancing the Hay round the Chairs,</L>
<L>He roar'd to his Frenchman to kick them down Stairs.</L>
<L>The Frenchman came forth with his outlandish Lingo,</L>
<L>Just the same as a Monkey, and made all the Men go:</L>
<L>I could not make out what he said, not a Word,</L>
<L>And his Lordship declar'd I was very absurd.</L>
<L>Says I, "Master RINGBONE, I've nothing to fear,</L>
<L>Tho' you be a Lord, and your Man a Mounseer,</L>
<L>For the May'r and the Aldermen bad them come here:</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="33"/>'—As absurd as I am,</L>
<L>'I don't care a Damn</L>
<L>'For you, nor your <HI>Valee de Sham:</HI></L>
<L>'For a Lord, do you see,</L>
<L>'Is nothing to me,</L>
<L>'Any more than a Flea;</L>
<L>'And your Frenchman so eager,</L>
<L>'With all his Soup Meagre,</L>
<L>'Is no more than a Mouse,</L>
<L>'Or a Bug, or a Louse,</L>
<L>'And I'll do as I please while I stay in the House;</L>
<L>'For the B—N—R—D Family all can afford</L>
<L>'To part with their Money as free as a Lord.—'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So I thank'd the Musicians, and gave them a Guinea,</L>
<L>Tho' the Ladies and Gentlemen call'd me a Ninny;</L>
<L>And I'll give them another the next Time they play,</L>
<L>For Men of good Fortune encourage, they say,</L>
<L>All Arts and all Sciences too in their Way;</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="34"/>And the Men were so kind as to hallow and bawl</L>
<L>"G-d bless you, Sir, thank you, good Fortune befall</L>
<L>Yourself, and the B—N—R—D Family all.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Excuse any more,—for I very well know</L>
<L>Both my Subject and Verse—<HI>is exceedingly low;</HI></L>
<L>But if any great Critic finds Fault with my Letter,</L>
<L>He has nothing to do but to send you a better.</L>

<HEAD>Mr. S— B—N—R—D, to Lady B—N—R—D, at — Hall, North. <HI>LETTER VI.</HI> IN WHICH Mr. <HI>B—N—R—D</HI> gives a Description of the <HI>BATHING.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THIS Morning, dear Mother, as soon as 'twas light,</L>
<L>I was wak'd by a Noise that astonish'd me quite,</L>
<L>For in TABITHA's Chamber I heard such a Clatter,</L>
<L>I could not conceive what the Deuce was the Matter:</L>
<L>And, would you believe it? I went up and found her</L>
<L>In a Blanket, with two lusty Fellows around her,</L>
<L>Who both seem'd a going to carry her off in</L>
<L>A little black Box just the Size of a Coffin:</L>
<L>Pray tell me, says I, what ye're doing of there?</L>
<L>"Why, Master, 'tis hard to be bilk'd of our Fare,</L>
<L>"And so we were thrusting her into a Chair:</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="36"/>"We don't see no Reason for using us so,</L>
<L>"For she bad us come hither, and now she won't go;</L>
<L>"We're earn'd all the Fare, for we both came and knock'd her</L>
<L>"Up, as soon as 'twas light, by Advice of the Doctor;</L>
<L>"And this is a Job that we often go a'ter</L>
<L>"For Ladies that choose to go into the Water."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'But pray,' says I, 'TABITHA, what is your Drift</L>
<L>'To be cover'd in Flannel instead of a Shift?</L>
<L>''Tis all by the Doctor's Advice, I suppose,</L>
<L>'That Nothing is left to be seen but your Nose:</L>
<L>'I think if you really intend to go in,</L>
<L>''Twould do you more good if you stript to the Skin,</L>
<L>'And if you've a Mind for a Frolick, i'fa'th</L>
<L>'I'll just step and see you jump into the Bath.'</L>
<L>So they hoisted her down just as safe and as well</L>
<L>And as snug as a Hod'mandod rides in his Shell:</L>
<L>I fain would have gone to see TABITHA dip,</L>
<L>But they turn'd at a Corner and gave me the Slip,</L>
<L>Yet in searching about I had better Success,</L>
<L>For I got to a Place where the Ladies undress;</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="37"/>Thinks I to myself, they are after some Fun,</L>
<L>And I'll see what they're doing as sure as a Gun:</L>
<L>So I peep'd at the Door, and I saw a great Mat</L>
<L>That cover'd a Table, and got under that,</L>
<L>And laid myself down there, as snug and as still</L>
<L>(As a Body may say) like a Thief in a Mill:</L>
<L>And of all the fine Sights I have seen, my dear Mother,</L>
<L>I never expect to behold such another:</L>
<L>How the Ladies did giggle and set up their Clacks,</L>
<L>All the while an old Woman was rubbing their Backs!</L>
<L>Oh 'twas pretty to see them all put on their Flannels,</L>
<L>And then take the Water like so many Spaniels,</L>
<L>And tho' all the while it grew hotter and hotter,</L>
<L>They swam, just as if they were hunting an Otter;</L>
<L>'Twas a glorious Sight to behold the Fair Sex</L>
<L>All wading with Gentlemen up to their Necks,</L>
<L>And view them so prettily tumble and sprawl</L>
<L>In a great smoaking Kettle as big as our Hall:</L>
<L>And To-Day many Persons of Rank and Condition</L>
<L>Were boil'd by Command of an able Physician,</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="38"/>Dean SPAVIN, Dean MANGEY, and Doctor DR'SQUIRT,</L>
<L>Were all sent from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to rub off their Dirt;</L>
<L>Judge SCRUB, and the worthy old Counsellor PEST</L>
<L>Join'd Issue at once, and went in with the rest:</L>
<L>And this they all said was exceedingly good</L>
<L>For strength'ning the Spirits, and mending the Blood.</L>
<L>It pleas'd me to see how they all were inclin'd</L>
<L>To lengthen their Lives for the Good of Mankind;</L>
<L>For I ne'er would believe that a Bishop or Judge</L>
<L>Can fancy old SATAN may owe him a Grudge,</L>
<L>Tho' some think the Lawyer may choose to <HI>Demur,</HI></L>
<L>And the Priest till another Occasion <HI>Defer,</HI></L>
<L>And both to be better prepar'd for herea'ter,</L>
<L>Take a Smack of the Brimstone contain'd in the Water.</L>
<L>But, what is surprising, no Mortal e'er view'd</L>
<L>Any one of the Physical Gentlemen stew'd;</L>
<L><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide OLD BATH GUIDE.</NOTE> Since the Day that King BLADUD first found out the Bogs;</L>
<L>And thought them so good for himself and his Hogs,</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="39"/>Not one of the Faculty ever has try'd</L>
<L>These excellent Waters to cure his own Hide:</L>
<L>Tho' many a skilful and learned Physician,</L>
<L>With Candour, good Sense, and profound Erudition,</L>
<L>Obliges the World with the Fruits of his Brain</L>
<L>Their Nature and hidden Effects to explain:</L>
<L>Thus CHIRON advis'd Madam THETIS to take</L>
<L>And dip her poor Child in the <HI>Stygian</HI> Lake,</L>
<L>But the worthy old Doctor was not such an Elf</L>
<L>As ever to venture his Carcase himself:</L>
<L>So JASON's good Wife us'd to set on a Pot,</L>
<L>And put in at once all the Patients she got,</L>
<L>But thought it sufficient to give her Direction,</L>
<L>Without being coddled to mend her Complexion:</L>
<L>And I never have heard that she wrote any Treatise</L>
<L>To tell what the Virtue of Water and Heat is.</L>
<L>You cannot conceive what a Number of Ladies</L>
<L>Were wash'd in the Water the same as our Maid is:</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="40"/>Old <HI>Baron</HI> VANTEAZER, a Man of great Wealth,</L>
<L>Brought his Lady the <HI>Baroness</HI> here for her Health;</L>
<L>The <HI>Baroness</HI> bathes, and she says that her Case</L>
<L>Has been hit to a Hair, and is mending apace:</L>
<L>And this is a Point all the Learned agree on,</L>
<L>The <HI>Baron</HI> has met with the Fate of ACTEON;</L>
<L>Who while he peep'd into the Bath had the Luck</L>
<L>To find himself suddenly chang'd to a Buck.</L>
<L>Miss SCRATCHIT went in, and the <HI>Countess</HI> of SCALES,</L>
<L>Both Ladies of very great Fashion in <HI>Wales;</HI></L>
<L>Then all on a sudden two Persons of Worth,</L>
<L>My Lady PANDORA MAC'SCURVEY came forth,</L>
<L>With General SULPHUR arriv'd from the North.</L>
<L>So TABBY, you see, had the Honour of Washing</L>
<L>With Folk of Distinction and very high Fashion,</L>
<L>But in Spite of good Company, poor little Soul,</L>
<L>She shook both her Ears like a Mouse in a Bowl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ods Bobs! how delighted I was unawares</L>
<L>With the Fiddles I heard in the Room above Stairs,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="41"/>For Music is wholesome the Doctors all think</L>
<L>For Ladies that bathe, and for Ladies that drink;</L>
<L>And that's the Opinion of ROBIN our Driver,</L>
<L>Who whistles his Nags while they stand at the River:</L>
<L>They say it is right that for every Glass</L>
<L>A Tune you should take, that the Water may pass;</L>
<L>So while little TABBY was washing her Rump,</L>
<L>The Ladies kept drinking it out of a Pump.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I've a deal more to say, but am loth to intrude</L>
<L>On your Time, my dear Mother, so now I'll conclude.</L>

<HEAD>Mr. S— B—N—R—D, to Lady B—N—R—I at — Hall, North. <HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> Mr. <HI>B—N—R—D</HI> goes to the <HI>Rooms.</HI>—His Opinion of <HI>Gaming.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM the earliest Ages, dear Mother, till now,</L>
<L>All Statesmen and great Politicians allow</L>
<L>That nothing advances the Good of a Nation,</L>
<L>Like giving all Money a free Circulation:</L>
<L>This Question from Members of Parliament draws</L>
<L>Many Speeches that meet universal Applause;</L>
<L>And if ever, dear Mother, I live to be one,</L>
<L>I'll speak on this Subject as sure as a Gun:</L>
<L>For <HI>Bath</HI> will I speak, and I'll make an Oration</L>
<L>Shall obtain me the Freedom of this Corporation;</L>
<L>I have no Kind of Doubt but the Speaker will beg</L>
<L>All the Members to <HI>Hear</HI> when I set out my Leg.</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="48"/>"Circulation of Cash—Circulation decay'd—</L>
<L>"Is at once the Destruction and Ruin of Trade;—</L>
<L>"Circulation—I say—Circulation it is,</L>
<L>"Gives Life to Commercial Countries like this:</L>
<L>What Thanks to the City of <HI>Bath</HI> then are due</L>
<L>From all who this Patriot Maxim pursue,</L>
<L>For in no Place whatever that National Good</L>
<L>Is practis'd so well, and so well understood!</L>
<L>What infinite Merit and Praise does she claim in</L>
<L>Her Ways and her Means for promoting of <HI>Gaming;</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Gaming,</HI> no doubt, is of infinite use</L>
<L>That same Circulation of Cash to produce;</L>
<L>What true public-spirited People are here</L>
<L>Who for that very Purpose come every Year!</L>
<L>All Eminent Men who no Trade ever knew</L>
<L>But <HI>Gaming,</HI> the only good Trade, to pursue;</L>
<L>All other Professions are subject to fail,</L>
<L>But <HI>Gaming</HI>'s a Bus'ness will ever prevail;</L>
<L>Besides 'tis the only good Way to commence</L>
<L>An Acquaintance with all Men of Spirit and Sense;</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="49"/>We may grub on without it thro' Life, I suppose,</L>
<L>But then 'tis with People—<HI>that Nobody knows.</HI></L>
<L>We ne'er can expect to be rich, wise, or great,</L>
<L>Or look'd upon fit for Employments of State:</L>
<L>'Tis your Men of fine Heads, and of nice Calculations</L>
<L>That afford so much Service to Administrations,</L>
<L>Who by frequent Experience know how to devize</L>
<L>The speediest Methods of raising Supplies.</L>
<L>'Tis such Men as these, Men of Honour and Worth,</L>
<L>That challenge Respect from all Persons of Birth,</L>
<L>And is it not right they should all be carest</L>
<L>When they're all so polite and so very well drest;</L>
<L>When they circulate freely the Money they've won,</L>
<L>And wear a lac'd Coat, tho' their Fathers wore none?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Trade is encourag'd as much, if not more,</L>
<L>By the tender soft Sex I shall ever adore;</L>
<L>But their Husbands those Brutes have been known to complain,</L>
<L>And swear they will never set Foot here again.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
<L>Ye Wretches ingrate! to find Fault with your Wives,</L>
<L>The Comfort, the Solace, and Joy of your Lives!</L>
<L>Don't SOLOMON speak of such Women with Rapture</L>
<L>In Verse his Eleventh and thirty-first Chapter?</L>
<L>He says, "If you find out a virtuous Wife,</L>
<L>"She will do a Man good all the Days of her Life;</L>
<L>"She deals like a Merchant, she sitteth up late."</L>
<L>And you'll find it is written in Verse Twenty-Eight,</L>
<L>"Her Husband is sure to be known at the Gate:</L>
<L>"He never hath Need or Occasion for Spoil</L>
<L>"When his Wife is much better employ'd all the while;</L>
<L>"She seeketh fine Wool and fine Linen she buys,</L>
<L>"And is clothed in Purple and Scarlet likewise.—"</L>
<L>Now pray don't your Wives do the very same thing,</L>
<L>And follow th' Advice of this worthy old King?</L>
<L>Do they spare for Expences themselves in adorning?</L>
<L>Don't they go about buying fine Things all the Morning?</L>
<L>And at Cards all the Night take the Trouble to play,</L>
<L>To get back the Money they spent in the Day?</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="51"/>And sure there's no Sort of Occasion to shew,</L>
<L>Ye are known at the Gate, or wherever ye go.</L>
<L>Pray are not your Ladies at <HI>Bath</HI> better plac'd</L>
<L>Than the Wife of a King who herself so disgrac'd,</L>
<L>And at <HI>Ithaca</HI> liv'd in <HI>such very bad Taste?</HI></L>
<L>Poor Soul! while her husband thought proper to leave her,</L>
<L>She slav'd all the Day like a Spitalfields Weaver,</L>
<L>And then, like a Fool, when her Web was half spun,</L>
<L>Pull'd to-pieces at Night all the Work she had done:</L>
<L>But these to their Husbands more Profit can yield,</L>
<L>And are much like a Lilly that grows in the Field;</L>
<L>They toil not indeed, nor indeed do they spin,</L>
<L>Yet they never are idle when once they begin,</L>
<L>But are very intent on encreasing their Store,</L>
<L>And always keep shuffling and cutting for more:</L>
<L>Industrious Creatures! that make it a Rule</L>
<L>To secure half the Fish while they <HI>manage</HI> the Pool:</L>
<L>So they win to be sure; yet I very much wonder</L>
<L>Why they put so much Money the Candlestick under,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="52"/>For up comes a Man on a sudden, Slapdash,</L>
<L>Snuffs the Candles, and carries away all the Cash:</L>
<L>And as Nobody troubles their Heads any more,</L>
<L>I'm in very great Hopes that it goes to the Poor.—</L>
<L>Methinks I should like to excel in a Trade,</L>
<L>By which such a Number their Fortunes have made.</L>
<L>I've heard of a wise philosophical Jew</L>
<L>That shuffles the Cards in a Manner that's new,</L>
<L>One JONAS, I think:—And cou'd wish for the future</L>
<L>To have that illustrious Sage for my Tutor;</L>
<L>And the Captain, whose Kindness I ne'er can forget,</L>
<L>Will teach me a Game that he calls Lansquenet;</L>
<L>So I soon shall acquaint you what Money I've won;</L>
<L>In the mean Time I rest, Your most dutiful Son,</L>

<L>TO humbler Strains, ye Nine, descend,</L>

<L>Not Odes with rapid Eagle flight,</L>
<L>That soar above all human Sight;</L>
<L>Not Fancy's fair and fertile Field,</L>

<L>The Captain!—Now you'll say my Dear,</L>
<L>Methinks I long his Name to hear,—</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="56"/>Why then—but don't you tell my Aunt</L>
<L>The Captain's Name is—CORMORANT:</L>

<L>Lo! where all the jocund Throng</L>
<L>From the Pump-Room hastes along,</L>
<L>To the Breakfast all invited</L>
<L>By Sir TOBY, lately knighted.</L>
<L>See with Joy my ROMEO comes;</L>
<L>He conducts me to the Rooms;</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="57"/>There he whispers, not unseen,</L>
<L>Tender Tales behind the Screen;</L>
<L>While his Eyes are fix'd on mine,</L>
<L>See each Nymph with Envy pine,</L>
<L>And with Looks of forc'd Disdain</L>
<L>Smile Contempt, but sigh in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O the charming Parties made!</L>
<L>Some to walk the South Parade,</L>
<L>Some to LINCOMB's shady Groves,</L>
<L>Or to SIMPSON's proud Alcoves;</L>
<L>Some for Chapel trip away,</L>
<L>Then take Places for the Play:</L>
<L>Or we walk about in Pattins,</L>
<L>Buying Gauzes, cheap'ning Sattins,</L>
<L>Or to PAINTER's we repair,</L>

<L>If at TOYSHOP I step in,</L>

<L>And the Music oft instructing;</L>
<L>See him tap the Time to shew,</L>

<LG>
<L>SO lively, so gay, my dear Mother, I'm grown,</L>
<L>I long to do something to make myself known;</L>
<L>For Persons of <HI>Taste</HI> and true <HI>Spirit,</HI> I find,</L>
<L>Are fond of attracting the Eyes of Mankind:</L>
<L>What Numbers one sees, who for that very Reason</L>
<L>Come to make such a Figure at <HI>Bath</HI> ev'ry Season!</L>
<L>'Tis This that provokes Mrs. SHENKIN AP-LEEK</L>
<L>To dine at the Ord'nary twice in a Week,</L>
<L>Tho' at Home she might eat a good Dinner in Comfort,</L>
<L>Nor pay such a cursed extravagant Sum for't:</L>

<L>Mrs. SHENKIN AP-LEEK had acquir'd a <HI>Bon Ton;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="63"/>Ne'er shewn how in <HI>Taste</HI> the AP-LEEKS can excel</L>
<L>The Dutchess of TRUFFLES, and Lady MORELL;</L>
<L>Had ne'er been ador'd by Sir PYE MACARONI,</L>
<L>And Count VERMICELLI, his intimate Crony;</L>
<L>Both Men of such <HI>Taste,</HI> their Opinions are taken</L>

<L>Which spends the most Money for splendid Apparel?</L>
<L>Why <HI>Spirit</HI>—to shew they have much better Sense</L>
<L>Than their Fathers, who rais'd it by Shillings and Pence.</L>
<L>What sends PETER TEWKSBURY every Night</L>
<L>To the Play with such infinite Joy and Delight?</L>
<L>Why PETER's a Critic, with true Attic Salt,</L>
<L>Can damn the Performers, can hiss, and find fault,</L>
<L>And tell when we ought to express Approbation,</L>
<L>By thumping, and clapping, and Vociferation;</L>
<L>So he gains our Attention, and all must admire</L>
<L>Young TEWKSBURY's Judgment, his <HI>Spirit</HI> and Fire.</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="64"/>But JACK DILETTANTE despises the Play'rs,</L>
<L>To Concerts and musical Parties repairs,</L>
<L>With Benefit-Tickets his Pockets he fills,</L>
<L>Like a Mountebank Doctor distributes his Bills;</L>
<L>And thus his Importance and Interest shews,</L>
<L>By conserring his Favours wherever He goes:</L>
<L>He's extremely polite both to me and my Couzen,</L>
<L>For he often desires us to take off a Dozen:</L>
<L>He has Taste, without doubt, and a delicate Ear,</L>
<L>No vile Oratorios ever could bear;</L>
<L>But talks of the Op'ras and his Signiora,</L>
<L>Cries <HI>Bravo, Benissimo, Bravo, Encora!</HI></L>
<L>And oft is so kind as to thrust in a Note</L>
<L>While old Lady CUCKOW is straining her Throat,</L>
<L>Or little Miss WREN, who's an excellent Singer,</L>
<L>Then he points to the Notes, with a Ring on his Finger,</L>
<L>And shews Her the Crotchet, the Quaver, and Bar,</L>
<L>All the Time that she warbles, and plays the <HI>Guitar:</HI></L>

<L>Thank Heaven of late, my dear Mother, my Face is</L>
<L>Not a little regarded at all public Places;</L>
<L>For I ride in a Chair with my Hands in a Muff,</L>
<L>And have bought a Silk Coat and embroidered the Cuff;</L>
<L>But the Weather was cold, and the Coat it was thin,</L>
<L>So the Taylor advis'd me to line it with Skin:</L>
<L>But what with my <HI>Nivernois'</HI> Hat can compare,</L>
<L>Bag-Wig, and lac'd Ruffles, and black Solitair?</L>
<L>And what can a Man of true Fashion denote,</L>

<L>My Stockings of Silk, are just come from the Hosier,</L>
<L>For To-night I'm to dance with the charming Miss TOZIER:</L>
<L>So I'd have them to know when I go to the Ball,</L>
<L>I shall shew as much <HI>Taste</HI> as the best of them all:</L>
<L>For a Man of great Fashion was heard to declare</L>
<L>He never beheld so engaging an Air,</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="66"/>And swears all the World must my Judgment confess,</L>
<L>My <HI>Solidity, Sense, Understanding</HI> in Dress,</L>
<L>My Manners so form'd, and my Wig so well curl'd,</L>
<L>I look like a Man <HI>of the very first World:</HI></L>
<L>But my Person and Figure you'll best understand</L>

<LG>
<L>WHAT Joy at the Ball, what Delight have I found,</L>
<L>By all the bright Circle encompass'd around!</L>
<L>Each Moment with Transport my Bosom felt warm,</L>
<L>For what, my dear Mother, like Beauty can charm?</L>
<L>The Remembrance alone, while their Praise I rehearse,</L>
<L>Gives Life to my Numbers, and Strength to my Verse:</L>
<L>Then allow for the Rapture the Muses inspire,</L>
<L>Such Themes call aloud for Poetical Fire.</L>
<L>I've read how the Goddesses meet all above,</L>
<L>And throng the immortal Assemblies of JOVE,</L>
<L>When join'd with the Graces fair VENUS appears,</L>
<L>Ambrosial sweet Odours perfume all the Spheres;</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="68"/>But the Goddess of Love, and the Graces and all,</L>
<L>Must yield to the Beauties I've seen at the Ball;</L>
<L>For JOVE never felt such a Joy at his Heart,</L>
<L>Such a Heat as these charming sweet Creatures impart.</L>
<L>In short—there is something in very fine Women,</L>
<L>When they meet all together — that's quite overcoming.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then say, O ye Nymphs that inhabit the Shades</L>
<L>Of <HI>Pindus'</HI> sweet Banks, <HI>Heliconian</HI> Maids,</L>
<L>Celestial Muses, ye Powers divine,</L>
<L>O say, for your Memory's better than mine,</L>
<L>What Troops of fair Virgins assembled around,</L>
<L>What Squadrons of Heroes for Dancing renown'd,</L>
<L>Were rouz'd by the Fiddle's harmonious Sound;</L>
<L>What Goddess shall first be the Theme of my Song,</L>
<L>Whose Name the clear AVON may murmur along,</L>
<L>And Echo repeat all the Vallies among!</L>
<L>Lady TETTATON's Sister, Miss FUBBY FATARMIN,</L>
<L>Was the first that presented her Person so charming,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="69"/>Than whom more engaging, more beautiful none,</L>
<L>A Goddess herself among Goddesses shone,</L>
<L>Excepting the lovely Miss TOWZER alone.</L>
<L>'Tis she that has long been the Toast of the Town,</L>
<L>Tho' all the World knows her Complexion is brown:</L>
<L>If some People think that her Mouth be too wide,</L>
<L>Miss TOWZER has numberless Beauties beside;</L>
<L>A Countenance noble, with sweet pouting Lips,</L>
<L>And a delicate Shape, from her Waist to her Hips;</L>
<L>Besides a prodigious rough black Head of Hair</L>
<L>That is frizzled and curl'd o'er her Neck that is bare;</L>
<L>I've seen the sweet Creature but once, I confess,</L>
<L>But her Air, and her Manner, and pleasing Address,</L>
<L>All made me feel something I ne'er can express.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lo! on a sudden what Multitudes pour</L>
<L>From <HI>Cambrian</HI> Mountains, from <HI>Indian</HI> Shore;</L>
<L>Bright Maidens, bright Widows, and fortunate Swains,</L>
<L>Who cultivate LIFFY's sweet Borders and Plains,</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="70"/>And they who their Flocks in fair ALBION seed,</L>
<L>Rich Flocks and rich Herds, (so the Gods have decreed)</L>
<L>Since they quitted the pleasanter Banks of the <HI>Tweed.</HI></L>
<L>Yet here no Confusion, no Tumult is known,</L>
<L>Fair Order and Beauty establish their Throne;</L>
<L>For Order and Beauty, and just Regulation,</L>
<L>Support all the Works of this ample Creation.</L>
<L>For This, in Compassion to Mortals below,</L>
<L>The Gods, their peculiar Favour to shew,</L>
<L>Sent HERMES to <HI>Bath</HI> in the Shape of a BEAU:</L>
<L>That Grandson of ATLAS came down from above</L>
<L>To bless all the Regions of Pleasure and Love;</L>

<L>She says that her Son will his Fortune advance,</L>
<L>By learning so early to fiddle and dance;</L>
<L>So she brings him to <HI>Bath,</HI> which I think is quite right,</L>
<L>For they do nothing else here from Morning till Night:</L>
<L>And this is a Lesson all Parents should know,</L>
<L>To train up a Child in the Way he should go;</L>
<L>For as SOLOMON says, you may safely uphold,</L>
<L>He ne'er will depart from the same when he's old.</L>
<L>No doubt she's a Woman of fine Understanding,</L>
<L>Her Air and her Presence there's something so grand in;</L>
<L>So wise and discreet; and to give Her her Due,</L>
<L>Dear Mother, she's just such a Woman as you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who is that Bombazine Lady so gay,</L>
<L>So profuse of her Beauties, in sable Array?</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="76"/>How she rests on her Heel, how she turns out her Toe,</L>
<L>How she pulls down her Stays, with her Head up to shew</L>
<L>Her Lilly-white Bosom that rivals the Snow!</L>
<L>'Tis the Widow QUICKLACKIT, whose Husband, last Week,</L>

<L>Six Days did she weep, and all Comfort refuse:</L>
<L>But STEPHEN, no Sorrow, no Tears can recall!—</L>
<L>So she hallows the Seventh, and comes to the Ball.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Music, sweet Music, has Charms to controul,</L>

<L>WHAT base and unjust Accusations we find</L>
<L>Arise from the Malice and Spleen of Mankind!</L>
<L>One would hope, my dear Mother, that Scandal would spare</L>
<L>The tender, the helpless, and delicate Fair;</L>
<L>But alas! the sweet Creatures all find it the Case,</L>
<L>That <HI>Bath</HI> is a very censorious Place.</L>
<L>Would you think that a Person I met since I came,</L>
<L>(I hope you'll excuse my concealing his Name)</L>
<L>A splenetic ill-natur'd Fellow, before</L>
<L>A Room full of very good Company, swore,</L>

<L>Their Hair and their Faces were none of their own;</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="79"/>And thus without Wit, or the least Provocation,</L>

<L>"Her Head has he robb'd with as little Remorse</L>
<L>"As a Fox-Hunter crops both his Dogs and his Horse:</L>
<L>"A Wretch that, so far from repenting his Theft,</L>
<L>"Makes a Boast of tormenting the little that's left:</L>
<L>"And first at her Porcupine Head he begins</L>
<L>"To fumble and poke with his Irons and Pins,</L>
<L>"Then fires all his Crackers with horrid Grimace,</L>

<L>One Thing tho' I wonder at much, I confess, is</L>

<L>WHAT Blessings attend, my dear Mother, all those</L>
<L>Who to Crowds of Admirers their Persons expose!</L>
<L>Do the Gods such a noble Ambition inspire;</L>
<L>Or Gods do we make of each ardent Desire?</L>
<L>O generous Passion! 'tis yours to afford</L>
<L>The splendid Assembly, the plentiful Board;</L>
<L>To thee do I owe such a Breakfast this Morn,</L>
<L>As I nee'r saw before, since the Hour I was born:</L>
<L>'Twas You made my Lord RAGGAMUFFENN come here,</L>
<L>Who they say has been lately created a Peer;</L>
<L>And To-day with extreme Complaisance and Respect ask'd</L>
<L>All the People at <HI>Bath</HI> to a general Breakfast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="89" REF="86"/>
<L>You've heard of my Lady BUNBUTTER, no doubt,</L>
<L>How she loves an <HI>Assembly, Fandango,</HI> or <HI>Rout;</HI></L>
<L>No Lady in <HI>London</HI> is half so expert</L>
<L>At a snug private Party, her Friends to divert;</L>
<L>But they say, that of late, she's grown sick of the Town,</L>
<L>And often to <HI>Bath</HI> condescends to come down:</L>
<L>Her Ladyship's favourite House is the <HI>Bear;</HI></L>
<L>Her Chariot, and Servants, and Horses are there:</L>
<L>My Lady declares that <HI>Retiring</HI> is good;</L>
<L>As all, with a separate Maintenance, should;</L>
<L>For when you have put out the conjugal Fire,</L>
<L>'Tis Time for all sensible Folk to retire;</L>
<L>If HYMEN no longer his Fingers will scorch,</L>
<L>Little CUPID for others can whip in his Torch,</L>
<L>So pert is he grown; since the Custom began,</L>
<L>To be married and parted as quick as you can.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now my Lord had the Honour of coming down Post,</L>
<L>To pay his Respects to so famous a Toast;</L>
<L>In Hopes He her Ladyship's Favour might win,</L>
<L>By playing the Part of a Host at an Inn.</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="87"/>I'm sure He's a Person of great Resolution,</L>
<L>Tho' delicate Nerves, and a weak Constitution;</L>
<L>For he carried us all to a Place cross the River,</L>
<L>And vow'd that the Rooms were too hot for his Liver:</L>
<L>He said it would greatly our Pleasure promote,</L>
<L>If we all for <HI>Spring-Gardens</HI> set out in a Boat:</L>
<L>I never as yet could his Reason explain,</L>
<L>Why we all sallied sorth in the Wind and the Rain?</L>
<L>For sure such Confusion was never yet known;</L>
<L>Here a Cap and a Hat, there a Cardinal blown:</L>
<L>While his Lordship, embroider'd, and powder'd all o'er,</L>
<L>Was bowing, and handing the Ladies ashore:</L>
<L>How the Misses did huddle and scuddle, and run;</L>
<L>One would think to be wet must be very good Fun;</L>
<L>For by waggling their Tails, they all seem'd to take Pains</L>
<L>To moisten their Pinions like Ducks when it rains;</L>
<L>And 'twas pretty to see how, like Birds of a Feather,</L>
<L>The People of Quality flock'd all together;</L>
<L>All pressing, addressing, caressing, and fond,</L>
<L>Just the same as those Animals are in a Pond:</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="88"/>You've read all their Names in the News, I suppose,</L>
<L>But, for fear you have not, take the List as it goes:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There was Lady GREASEWRISTER,</L>
<L>And Madam VAN-TWISTER,</L>
<L>Her Ladyship's Sister.</L>
<L>Lord CRAM, and Lord VULTUR,</L>
<L>Sir BRANDISH O' CULTER,</L>
<L>With Marshal CAROUZER,</L>
<L>And old Lady MOWZER,</L>
<L>And the great <HI>Hanoverian</HI> Baron PANSMOWZER,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Besides many others; who all in the Rain went,</L>
<L>On purpose to honour this grand Entertainment:</L>
<L>The Company made a most brilliant Appearance,</L>
<L>And ate Bread and Butter with great Perseverance;</L>
<L>All the Chocolate too, that my Lord set before 'em,</L>
<L>The Ladies dispatch'd with the utmost Decorum.</L>
<L>Soft musical Numbers were heard all around,</L>
<L>The Horns and the Clarions echoing sound:</L>
<L>Sweet were the Strains, as od'rous Gales that blow</L>
<L>O'er fragrant Banks, where Pinks and Roses grow.</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="89"/>The Peer was quite ravish'd, while close to his Side</L>
<L>Sat Lady BUNBUTTER, in beautiful Pride!</L>
<L>Oft turning his Eyes, he with Rapture survey'd</L>
<L>All the powerful Charms she so nobly display'd.</L>
<L>As when at the Feast of the great ALEXANDER</L>
<L>TIMOTHEUS, the musical Son of THERSANDER,</L>

<L>Was for shaking the Spheres,</L>
<L>Such Goods all the Gods did provide Him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Grew bolder and bolder,</L>
<L>And cock'd up his Shoulder,</L>
<L>Like the Son of great JUPITER AMMON,</L>
<L>Till at length quite opprest,</L>

<L>All the Speeches my Lord made to Lady BUNBUTTER!</L>
<L>So polite all the Time, that he ne'er touch'd a Bit,</L>

<L>For they tell me that Men of <HI>true Taste,</HI> when they treat,</L>
<L>Must talk a great deal, but they never should eat;</L>
<L>And if that be the Fashion, I never will give</L>
<L>Any grand Entertainment as long as I live:</L>
<L>For I'm of Opinion, 'tis proper to chear</L>
<L>The Stomach and Bowels, as well as the Ear.</L>
<L>Nor me did the charming Concerto of ABEL</L>
<L>Regale like the Breakfast I saw on the Table;</L>
<L>I freely will own I the Muffins preferr'd</L>
<L>To all the genteel Conversation I heard;</L>
<L>E'en tho' I'd the Honour of sitting between</L>
<L>My Lady STUFF-DAMASK, and PEGGY MOREEN,</L>
<L>Who both flew to <HI>Bath</HI> in the <HI>London</HI> Machine.</L>
<L><PB N="94" REF="91"/>Cries PEGGY, "This Place is enchantingly pretty;</L>
<L>"We never can see such a Thing in the City:</L>
<L>"You may spend all your Life-Time in <HI>Cateaton</HI> Street,</L>
<L>"And never so civil a Gentleman meet;</L>
<L>"You may talk what you please; you may search <HI>London</HI> thro';</L>
<L>"You may go to <HI>Carlisle</HI>'s, and to <HI>Almanac</HI>'s too;</L>
<L>"And I'll give you my Head if you find such a Host,</L>
<L>"For Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, Butter, and Toast:</L>
<L>"How He welcomes at once all the World and his Wife,</L>
<L>"And how civil to Folk he ne'er saw in his Life.—"</L>
<L>"These Horns, cries my Lady, so tickle one's Ear,</L>
<L>"Lard! what would I give that Sir SIMON was here!</L>
<L>"To the next Public Breakfast Sir SIMON shall go,</L>
<L>"For I find here are Folks one may venture to know:</L>
<L>"Sir SIMON would gladly his Lordship attend,</L>
<L>"And my Lord would be pleas'd with so chearful a Friend."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when we had wasted more Bread at a Breakfast</L>
<L>Than the poor of our Parish have ate for this Week past,</L>
<L><PB N="95" REF="92"/>I saw, all at once, a prodigious great Throng,</L>
<L>Come bustling, and rustling, and jostling along:</L>
<L>For his Lordship was pleas'd that the Company now</L>
<L>To my Lady BUNBUTTER should curt'sey and bow;</L>
<L>And my Lady was pleas'd too, and seem'd vastly proud,</L>
<L>At once to receive all the Thanks of a Crowd:</L>
<L>And when, like <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> we all had ador'd</L>
<L>This beautiful Image, set up by my Lord,</L>
<L>Some few insignificant Folk went away,</L>
<L>Just to follow th'Employments and Calls of the Day;</L>
<L>But those who knew better their Time how to spend,</L>
<L>The Fiddling and Dancing all chose to attend.</L>
<L>Miss CLUNCH and Sir TOBY perform'd a <HI>Cotillon,</HI></L>
<L>Much the same as our SUSAN and BOB the Postilion;</L>
<L>All the while her Mamma was expressing her Joy,</L>
<L>That her Daughter the Morning so well could employ.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>What a dreadful Disaster attended the Peer:</L>

<L>I must fill you full of Love.</L>

<L>Just with ROGER's Head of Hair on,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>First I thought it was the Night-Mare</L>
<L>Lay so heavy on my Breast;</L>

<HEAD>Mr. S— B—N—R—D, to Lady B—N—R—D, at — Hall, North. <HI>LETTER XV. Serious REFLECTIONS</HI> of Mr. <HI>B—R—D.</HI>—His <HI>BILL of EXPENCES.</HI>—A <HI>Farewell</HI> to <HI>BATH.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ALAS, my dear Mother, our Evil and Good</L>
<L>By few is distinguish'd, by few understood:</L>
<L>How oft are we doom'd to repent at the End,</L>
<L>The Events that our pleasantest Prospects attend;</L>
<L>As SOLON declar'd, in the last Scene alone,</L>
<L>All the Joys of our Life, all our Sorrows are known.</L>
<L>When first I came hither for Vapours and Wind,</L>
<L>To cure all Distempers, and study Mankind;</L>
<L>How little I dream'd of the Tempest behind.</L>
<L>I never once thought what a furious Blast,</L>
<L>What Storms of Distress would o'erwhelm me at last.</L>
<L>How wretched am I! what a fine Declamation</L>
<L>Might be made on the Subject of my Situation!</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="98"/>I'm a Fable!— an Instance!— and serve to dispense</L>
<L>An Example to all Men of Spirit and Sense:</L>
<L>To all Men of Fashion, and all Men of Wealth,</L>
<L>Who come to this place to recover their Health:</L>
<L>For my Means are so small, and my Bills are so large,</L>
<L>I ne'er can come home till you send a Discharge.</L>
<L>Let the Muse speak the Cause, if a Muse yet remain,</L>
<L>To supply me with Rhimes, and express all my Pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Paid Bells, and Musicians,</L>
<L>Drugs, Nurse, and Physicians,</L>
<L>Balls, Raffles, Subscriptions, and Chairs;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wigs, Gowns, Skins and Trimming,</L>
<L>Good Books for the Women,</L>
<L>Plays, Concerts, Tea, Negus, and Prayers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Paid the following Schemes,</L>
<L>Of all who it seems</L>
<L>Make Charity Business their Care:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Gamester decay'd,</L>
<L>And a prudish old Maid,</L>
<L>By Gaiety brought to Despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><PB N="102" REF="99"/>A Fidler of Note,</L>
<L>Who, for Lace on his Coat,</L>
<L>To his Taylor was much in Arrears;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An Author of Merit,</L>
<L>Who wrote with such Spirit,</L>
<L>The Pillory took off his Ears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Sum, my dear Mother, far heavier yet,</L>
<L>Captain CORMORANT won, when I learn'd Lansquenet;</L>
<L>Two Hundred I paid him, and Five am in Debt.</L>
<L>For the Five, I had nothing to do but to <HI>write,</HI></L>
<L>For the Captain was very well bred, and polite,</L>
<L>And took, as he saw my Expences were great,</L>
<L>My Bond, to be paid on the <HI>Clodpole</HI> Estate;</L>
<L>And asks nothing more while the Money is lent,</L>
<L>Than Interest paid him at Twenty per Cent.</L>
<L>But I'm shock'd to relate what Distresses befall</L>
<L>Miss JENNY, my Sister and TABBY and all:</L>
<L>Miss JENNY, poor Thing, from this <HI>Bath</HI> Expedition,</L>
<L>Was in Hopes very soon to have chang'd her Condition;</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="100"/>But Rumour has brought certain Things to her Ear,</L>
<L>Which I ne'er will believe, yet am sorry to hear;</L>
<L>"That the Captain, her Lover, her dear ROMEÔ,</L>
<L>Was Banish'd the Army a great while ago.</L>
<L>That his Friends and his Foes He alike can betray,</L>
<L>And picks up a scandalous Living by Play:"</L>
<L>But if e'er I could think that the Captain had cheated,</L>
<L>Or my dear Cousin JENNY unworthily treated,</L>
<L>By all that is sacred I swear, for his Pains</L>
<L>I'd cudgel him first, and then blow out his Brains.</L>
<L>For the Man I abhor like the Devil, dear Mother,</L>
<L>Who one Thing conceals, and professes another.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O how shall we know the right Way to pursue!—</L>
<L>Do the Ills of Mankind from Religion accrue!—</L>
<L>Religion, design'd to relieve all our Care,</L>
<L>Has brought my poor Sister to Grief and Despair:</L>
<L>Now she talks of Damnation, and screws up her face;</L>
<L>Then prates about ROGER, and spiritual Grace:</L>
<L>Her senses, alas! seem at once gone astray—</L>
<L>No Pen can describe it, no Letter convey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the <HI>Man without Sin,</HI> that <HI>Moravian</HI> Rabbi,</L>
<L>Has perfectly cur'd the <HI>Chlorosis</HI> of TABBY;</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="101"/>And, if right I can judge, from her Shape and her Face,</L>
<L>She soon may produce him an Infant of Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now they say that all People, in our Situation,</L>
<L>Are very fine subjects for Regeneration:</L>
<L>But I think, my dear Mother, the best we can do,</L>
<L>Is to pack up our All, and return back to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Farewell then, ye Streams,</L>
<L>Ye poetical Themes!</L>
<L>Sweet Fountains for curing the Spleen!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'm griev'd to the Heart,</L>
<L>Without Cash to depart,</L>
<L>And quit this adorable Scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where Gaming and Grace</L>
<L>Each other embrace,</L>
<L>Dissipation and Piety meet:—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May all, who've a Notion</L>
<L>Of Cards or Devotion,</L>
<L>Make <HI>Bath</HI> their delightful Retreat.</L>
