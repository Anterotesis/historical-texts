<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Hold it an indispensible Duty to mention some Circumstances, which gave Birth to the follow∣ing Scenes, wherein I shall not only indulge my Pride, but, perhaps, in some Degree, palliate the Boldness, and (as it may be thought by many) Presumption of my Understanding.</P>
<P>The Fable and Conduct of this Tragedy were projected as long ago as the Year 1761, by <HI>the late</HI> Mr. <HI>Shenstone,</HI> at his sweet Retirement, the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire.</HI> Herein consists my Pride, that I enjoyed a happy (but too short) Intimacy with that amiable and accomplished Man.</P>
<P>In the Summer of that same Year, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Shenstone</HI>'s Letter, No. 105, to Mr. <HI>Graves, Sept.</HI> 14, 1761.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Shen∣stone</HI> had been present at the Performance of a hasty Alteration of Mr. <HI>Hawkins'</HI>s Tragedy of <HI>Henry and Rosamond,</HI> which I produced at the Theatre at <HI>Birmingham,</HI> for the temporary Use of a particular Friend. Undigested and imperfect as it was, that excellent Judge said, there was a Pathos in the Story, which, notwithstanding the Defects of the Drama,
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
made the Representation very pleasing; and he signified his Wonder that such an affecting and <HI>popular Tale</HI> should not have found its Way to the Stage. Hence arose many Conversations on the Subject, all which terminated in his advising me <HI>to make the Story my own.</HI> The known Kind∣ness of his Heart, perhaps, gave me Credit for greater Abilities, than I really possessed. He con∣tinued to encourage me with a Warmth which flatters me in the Pecollection; and, after I had left <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> obliged me with several Let∣ters to the same Purpose, which I still preserve as <HI>valuable Relicts.</HI></P>
<P>In one of those Letters he suggested the Cha∣racter of the <HI>Abbot;</HI> in Order, as he said, to add a little more Business to a Story, which otherwise might be too barren to furnish Matter for five Acts. It may easily be supposed I forthwith adopted his Idea, and carefully treasured in my Mind every Sentiment he let fall on this, as well as other Subjects; and I can say, with great Truth, that among the many Conversations I en∣joyed with that excellent Man, I never knew one from which I did not derive considerable In∣struction, as well as Delight.</P>
<P>The unexpected Loss of this most estimable Friend <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died <HI>Feb.</HI> 11, 1763.</NOTE> (which will ever be lamented by all who knew him) dispirited me from the Undertaking,
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
and I laid aside my Plan, together with all his Letters, till the Beginning of last Year. The Scheme itself, it is true, had often, in the Inter∣val, occurred to my Remembrance, but a Doubt of my Ability to execute it, even in a <HI>passable</HI> Manner, deterred me from the Attempt.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Hartley</HI>'s Arrival at <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Thea∣tre, and the warm Solicitations of a Friend, in∣duced me once more to resume the Design. The happy <HI>Suitability</HI> (if I may be allowed the Phrase) of her Figure, to the Description of <HI>Ro∣samond</HI> (as may be found in Dr. <HI>Percy</HI>'s amusing and instructive Collection of old Ballads, Vol. ii. Page 137) viz.
<Q><L>Her crisped Lockes, like Threads of Golde,</L>
<L>Appear'd to each Man's Sight;</L>
<L>Her sparkling Eyes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</L></Q>
assisted by the Softness and Gentleness of her Demeanour, encouraged me, at length, to make the Attempt; and the unniverfal Aprobation given by the Public to her Appearance, Manner and Performance, on the first Representation of this Play, happily convinced me I was not singular in my Opinion.</P>
<P>In the general Execution of the Piece I have paid a particular Attention to the <HI>old Ballad,</HI> and endeavoured at a Simplicity of Style, both which Mr. <HI>Shenstone</HI> earnestly recommended. I am not conscious of any further Helps, except having
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
adopted the Idea (not the Matter) of an Interview between the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Clifford</HI> in the Monastery, from Mr. <HI>Hawkins.</HI></P>
<P>I had originally made <HI>Clifford</HI> die of a broken Heart, under the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction of the Death of <HI>King Lear,</HI> as originally drawn by that great Master of human Nature. <HI>Shakespeare;</HI> but the general Opi∣nion of the Public, and the Persuasions of my Friends, induced me to vary my Design in the Representation.</P>
<P>I have little further to add, but my Intreaties that the Reader will be pleased to judge with Le∣nity, what was undertaken with Diffidence.</P>
<P>Advised, assisted, and encouraged as I was ori∣ginally, to this Undertaking, by the Possessor of such eminent Abilities, and such Benignity of Disposition, I seek no <HI>living</HI> Patron, but pride myself in having this Opportunity to dedicate my humble Production,</P>
<P>With the warmest Affection and Gratitude,</P>

<LG>
<L>LONG Time oppress'd with painful Doubts and Fears,</L>
<L>At length the dread decisive Hour appears,</L>
<L>The awful Trial comes! and here I stand,</L>
<L>T' abide the Verdict of my native Land.</L>
<L>Will not the Judge himself for Favour plead,</L>
<L>When the poor trembling Culprit owns the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</L>
<L>When in false Arts he scorns to seck Support,</L>
<L>But throws him on the Mercy of the Court?</L>

<L>Such is my State, whom will Ambition draws</L>
<L>To stand the Judgment of dramatic Laws;</L>
<L>Bold the Attempt, (and, much I fear, in vain),</L>
<L>That I, the humblest in the Muses' Train,</L>
<L>Should dare produce; in this nice-judging Age,</L>
<L>My own weak Efforts on the dang'rous Stage!</L>

<L><HI>Had I the slightest Touch of plaintive</HI> Rowe,</L>

<L><HI>Your Plaudit undismay'd I might implore,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And</HI> Rosamond <HI>might plead, like hapless</HI> Shore:</L>

<L>But as it is, your Kindness be my Friend,</L>
<L>For that alone I sue—to that I bend.</L>
<L>If by an artless Tale, in artless Strain,</L>
<L>A mild and patient Hearing I obtain,</L>
<L>And my poor Labours o'er, behold ye part</L>

<P>This curious edition is beautifully printed on fine demy pa∣per, in five volumes, price only Fifteen Shillings sewed; and also on superfine royal paper, large enough to admit of mar∣ginal notes, at One Guinea per set, sewed.</P>
<P>It contains twenty-four of the author's most esteemed plays, each of which is ornamented with a beautiful frontispiece, and regulated, by permission of the Managers, agreeable to the pre∣sent mode of performance at the Theatres Royal in London, by Mr. Hopkins, prompter, at Drury-lane, and Mr. Younger, prompter, at Covent-garden; with notes critical and illustra∣tive, respecting the text, and the requisites necessary to do each material character justice on the stage, By the AUTHORS of the DRAMATIC CENSOR.</P>
<P>The Introduction contains an essay on Oratory, which may serve as improving lessons to professors of the pulpit and the bar, as well as of the stage.—The less esteemed plays of Shakespeare will be published early this season, in order to complete this immortal author's works, in the same elegant and convenient manner; those, therefore, who wish to possess the first impressions of the future, as well as the present plates, are desired to forward their address as soon as possible to the publishers.</P>

<HEAD>CRITIQUE on Part of the PLATES in BELL's Edition of SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>Excellent engraving is a beauty of itself, and will always to the generality of people appear an ornament, independent of the design, or other qualities, of a good print. The French seem to have understood this better than any other nation.</P>
<P>In imitation of the magnificent editions of the Louvre, they have bedecked their ordinary books with cuts, signets, meda∣lions, head and tail pieces; in the execution of which lies all their merit. Neatness and propriety strike at once a superfi∣cial eye, and therefore aiding their language with <HI>the bagatelles</HI> I have mentioned, the Parifians are thought to have sold more books than any three cities in Europe.</P>
<P>An edition of Shakespeare's acting plays being lately adver∣tised, I had the curiosity to glance at the proposals, but coming to that part of the advertisement, where five volumes, with <HI>elegant plates,</HI> are offered for fifteen shillings, I pitied Shake∣speare, and thought no more of the work. They are now pu∣blished, and afford a happy instance of what the public are to expect from a bookseller, who has spirit to share his profits with artists of merit. I had often thought of writing some∣thing
<PB REF="90"/>
upon the present subject, and cannot, without injustice, pass this new edition in silence.</P>
<P>With exception of one or two at most, these plates are highly finished, finished with freedom and force, united to the admired neatness of the French <HI>Burin.</HI> I am sorry the designs are not, upon the whole, equal to the execution▪ though many of them merit the highest applause; and since I have criti∣cised the plates of former editions, I shall make equally free with the present, and praise or blame, where, in my opinion, either is deserved.</P>
<P><HI>Othello</HI> gives no idea of the noble Moor. The expression of jealousy is too ambiguous and strong to be marked with suc∣cess in miniature; he looks not like an injured soldier, but an old enraged eunuch of the seraglio. <HI>Iago</HI> is an excellent figure, his action steady, the attitude speaks design, and the eye watches the effect of his villany upon the unhappy husband.</P>
<P><HI>Brutus</HI> and the <HI>Evil Genius</HI> would not make the ghost of a Roman between them; it is a bad print, and no part of it better than another.</P>
<P><HI>Rosalind</HI> and her companion, in the comedy of <HI>As you like it,</HI> is one of the sweetest cuts I remember to have seen; the action is well chosen, the expression just, and the execution delicate as the subject. The softness of the sex shines through the ma∣sculine dress, and finely conveys the idea of the poet. Had the trees in the back ground been executed with a little more care, and the keeping better preserved, this print would have been a master-piece.</P>
<P>Every person must be pleased with <HI>Pistol</HI> in <HI>Harry the fifth:</HI> the design is good, the action natural—the expression strong, and the execution superior to any poetical cut I ever saw in an English publication.</P>
<P><HI>Iachimo</HI> and <HI>Imogen</HI> deserve great approbation; the seene is dumb show, therefore capable of being perfectly represented: accordingly, the <HI>sang-froid</HI> of the Italian, taking an inventory of the lady's beauty, is nicely hit—she sleeps well; her po∣sture is natural, and the execution fleshy and delicate.</P>
<P>The delivery of the letter in <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> must also give universal satisfaction; there is a great deal of character in the king and <HI>Wolsey,</HI> and what is further commendable, they are portraits of these personages. <HI>Wolsey</HI> receives the letter with a courtly smile, in place of that stupefaction visible in the Car∣dinal of Gravelot, before its contents were known.</P>
<P><HI>Falstaff</HI> assuming the conquest of <HI>Percy,</HI> is a pleasant high-finished cut; <HI>Sir John</HI> recalls rather too much the idea of Mr. Shuter in that part, but the youth and gallant figure of the prince is happily struck, and the fallen <HI>Percy</HI> judiciously fore∣shortened. I think he should have retained something of the terrible in death.</P>
<P><PB REF="91"/>
<HI>Doctor Caius, Mrs. Quickly,</HI> and <HI>Simple,</HI> in the <HI>Merry Wives of Windsor,</HI> are truly comic, well conceived, and convey the very spirit of the scene; the execution is equal to the design, and make together a very perfect print.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Grignion</HI> has been very happy in the frontispiece for <HI>Much ado about Nothing—</HI>His etching gives a peculiar spirit to a print, where he is pleased to bestow pains and the arch smile in the face of the prince and <HI>Leonato,</HI> in pretended con∣ference, demands the attention of an actor.</P>
<P>The feelings of old <HI>Lear,</HI> are finely marked; the figure, though small, is dignified; and poor <HI>Tom</HI> almost shivers upon the paper.</P>
<P>I could with pleasure review the others, but have already exceeded the short sketch intended. The subject of prints is fertile and entertaining. I could wish to see it treated by those who have more leisure and abilities than I am master of. Their merits might thence become more generally understood, and the art rendered of solid use and ornament to the works of the learned.</P>
<P>The present publication I consider as a considerable ad∣vance to this improvement, and the public will likely view it in the same light.</P>

<ITEM><P>FENCING FAMILIARIZ'D; or a new treatise on the ART of SWORD-PLAY. Illustrated by elegant engravings, represent∣ing all the different attitudes on which the principles and grace of the art depend; painted from life, and executed in a most elegant and masterly manner. By Mr. OLIVIER, educated at the Royal Academy at Paris, and professor of fencing, in London. Price 7s. bound.</P>
<Q>The author of this work humbly presumes, that he has offered many considerable improvements in the art of fencing; having founded his principles on nature, and confuted many false notions, hitherto adopted by the most eminent masters; he has rendered the play simple, and made it easy and plain, even to those who were before unacquainted with this Art. After bringing his scholar as far as the assault, and having demonstrated to him all the thrusts and various parades, he lays down rules for defence in all sorts of sword-play." The Monthly reviewers, express themselves in the following terms: "For ought we dare say to the contrary, Mr. Olivier's book is a very good book, and may help to teach, as much as books can teach, the noble science of defence; or, as our author terms it, sword-play; and it is made more particularly useful, by the various attitudes and positions, which seem to be here accurately and elegantly delineated.</Q></ITEM>

Price 11. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>This work is elegantly executed from copper plates, on superfine writing demy paper, and may be had of all the booksellers in England, by enquiring for Bell's Library Common-Place Book, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon Mr. Locke's princi∣ples.

Ditto, if bound in parch∣ment, 1l. and so in proportion for any quantity of paper this book may con∣tain, deducting or adding two shillings for every quire that may be increased or decreased, and bound as above.</P>
<Q>Mr. Locke has confined his elucid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion to the advantages arising from reading; in selecting remarkable passages from b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oks: but this is not the only purpose to which the Common-Place Book may be successfully applied. It is not solely for the divine, the lawyer, the poet, philoso∣pher, or historian, that this publication is calculated: but these its uses are experimentally known, and universally admitted. It is for the use and emolument of the man of business, as well as of letters; for men of fashion and fortune, as well as of study; for the traveller, the trader; and in short for all those who would form a system of useful and agreeable knowledge, in a manner peculiar to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emselves, while they are following their accustomed pursuits, either of profit or pleasure.</Q></ITEM>

<Q>These two volumes are supposed to comprehend the whole of the au∣thor's design: he has given a critical investigation of above fifty of the most considerable acting plays; with remarks also on the performers who have appeared in the principal characters of those plays. He seems to be intimately conversant with theatrical affairs, to have formed a just esti∣mate of the merit of the actors; and to have offered many judicious criti∣cisms on the writings of our principal dramatic poets.

<P>The GENTLEMAN's POCKET FARRIER, shewing how to use your horse on a journey; and what remedies are proper for common accidents that may befal him on the road.</P>
<P>This little tract has been in great estimation, for these fifty years past, and has gone through many edition in Ireland. The remedies it prescribes, are simple, and easily obtained, and never fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of cure, where the disorder is curable. And no man who values his horse should presume to travel without it.</P>
<P>ADVERTISEMENT.</P>
<P>It may not be unnecessary to acquaint the reader, that these prescriptions have not been hastily jumbled together, but are experimentally efficacious. A great many books have been written on farrlery, of which Gibson's is undoubtedly the best, but his rules are too tedious for the pocket. Such a book therefore as this, is necessary on a journey, in order to refer to as oc∣casion requires; and it contains as much as is known by any of our common farriers.</P>
<P>As small as this tract may appear, it will be found to inform gentlemen, first, what methods are best to be used, if their horses fall lame. Secondly, what medicines are proper to give him when sick. Thirdly, how to direct the operations, and escape the impositions, of ignorant men. In short, by the help of this treatise, gentlemen will be able to prevent a groom or farrier from injuring their horses, by improper applications, and mistaking one distemper for another.</P>
<P>The receipts are few, naked, and cheap; the poultice but one, and con∣trived on purpose to prevent trouble, and save time and cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges, by pointing out the best remedies at first, such as are easiest to be got, and such as make the speediest cures: and the reader may be assured that they have been expe∣rimentally confirmed, by a practice of thirty years. The book is drawn up in a manner calculated for a gentleman's pocket, supposing him upon a jour∣ney; and no man, who values his horse, should travel without it.</P></ITEM>
