<HEAD>DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Legend having been read to a small Circle of select Friends, one Lady, with great Eager∣ness of Manner, asked the Editor, to whom he intended to dedicate it? He replied, with Truth, that he had not yet determined. "To whom," added she, <Q>can you so properly address it, as to <HI>Him,</HI> whose Image cleaves to us during the Recital; <HI>Him,</HI> to whom we owe a livelier Idea of RICHARD the <HI>Third,</HI> than either Historian or Painter ever gave; <HI>Him,</HI> whose Judge ment and Powers of Execution keep Pace with the fine Imagination of that <HI>Poet,</HI> whom <HI>He delighteth to Honour?</HI></Q> These were nearly her exact Words, and the Editor pleads them in Excuse for the Liberty he now takes of dedicating this Poem, With great Respect and Esteem, TO DAVID GARRICK, Esq.</P>

<HEAD>PREFATORY ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem fell into the Editor's Hands by a peculiar Means, which he is not at present permitted to reveal. He hopes the Singularity of the Story, and the moral Ten∣dency, which so obviously and strongly in∣culcates THE DUTY OF A PATIENT SUBMIS∣SION TO THE DESTINATIONS OF PROVIDENCE, IN ALL VICISSITUDES AND AFFLICTIONS OF LIFE, will justify his giving it to the World. He judged it too curious to be ut∣terly lost; and his Desire to preserve it,
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
induced him to collect, and scatter in Notes throughout the Work, such curious Particulars as (in his Judgment) prove the actual Existence of such a Person as RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and the chief Event of his Life to have been incontestibly certain.</P>

<L>Oft have I labour'd to forget my Birth,</L>

<L>And place my former self before my Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Yet I complain not, tho' I feel anew,</L>
<L>All as I speak, fell Fortune's bitter Spite,</L>

<L>Perchance Contentment had not been my Mate,</L>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>My Course, perchance, had been one dazzling Glare</L>

<L>The quiet Comforts of this humble Sphere,</L>
<L>Rest undisturb'd, and Reason's tranquil Thought.</L>

<L>But whither roam I? O! forgive, my kind,</L>

</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Of those Care-woven, long-protracted Years,</L>
<L>Some sixteen Summers pass'd obscurely on,</L>
<L>A Stranger to the World, its Hopes, and Fears,</L>
<L>My Name, Birth, Fortunes, to myself unknown.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Plac'd in a rural, soft, serene Retreat,</L>
<L>With a deep-learn'd Divine I held Abode,</L>
<L>Who sought, by pious Laws and Conduct meet,</L>
<L>The Way to Immortality and God.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>By him instructed, I attain'd the sweet,</L>
<L>The precious Blessings that from Learning flow,</L>
<L>He fann'd in my young Breast the genial Heat,</L>
<L>That bids th' expanding Mind with Ardor glow.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>He taught me with delighted Eye to trace</L>
<L>The comely Beauties of the <HI>Mantuan</HI> Page,</L>
<L>Enraptur'd mix with <HI>Tully</HI>'s polish'd Grace,</L>
<L>Or catch the Flame of <HI>Homer</HI>'s martial Rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Nor stopt he there, Preceptor excellent,</L>
<L>Nor deem'd that Wisdom lay in Books alone,</L>
<L>But would explain what moral Virtue meant,</L>
<L>And bid us make our Neighbour's Woes our own.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>Heaven's genuine Pity glist'ning in his Eyes,</L>
<L>The Sweets of Charity he would instill,</L>
<L>And teach what Blessedness of Comfort lies</L>
<L>In universal Mercy and Good-will.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>So taught this pious Man, so thought, so did,</L>
<L>Squaring his Actions to his Tenets true;</L>
<L>His Counsel or Relief to none deny'd,</L>
<L>A general Good, like Heav'n's all-chearing Dew!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>Thus guided, thus inform'd, thus Practice-drawn,</L>
<L>In guileless Peace my Spring of Life was spent,</L>
<L>My Leisure-hours I sported o'er the Lawn,</L>
<L>Nor knew what restless Care or Sorrow meant.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>A courteous Stranger, ever and anon,</L>
<L>My kind Instructor's due Reward supply'd;</L>
<L>But still my Name, my Birth, alike unknown,</L>
<L>Wrapt in the Gloom of Secrecy lay hid.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>One Autumn-Morn (the Time I well recall)</L>
<L>That Stranger drew me from my soft Retreat,</L>
<L>And led my Footsteps to a lofty Hall,</L>
<L>Where State and Splendor seem'd to hold their Seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>Thro' a long Range of spacious gilded Rooms</L>
<L>Dubious I pass'd, admiring as I went,</L>
<L>On the rich-woven Labours of the Looms,</L>
<L>The sculptur'd Arch, or painted Roof intent.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>My Guide, at length, withdrew; wrapt in Suspense</L>
<L>And Fear I stood, yet knew not what I fear'd;</L>
<L>When straight to my appall'd, astounded Sense</L>
<L>A Man of noble Port and Mien appear'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>His Form commanded, and his Visage aw'd,</L>
<L>My Spirit sunk as he advanced nigh,</L>
<L>With stately Step along the Floor he trod,</L>
<L>Fix'd on my Face his penetrating Eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>The dancing Plumage o'er his Front wav'd high,</L>
<L>Thick-studded Ribs of Gold adorn'd his Vest,</L>
<L>In splendid Folds his purple Robe did ply,</L>
<L>And royal Emblems glitter'd on his Breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>I sought to bend me, but my Limbs refus'd</L>
<L>Their wonted Office, motionless and chill;</L>
<L>Yet somewhat, as the Figure I perus'd,</L>
<L>A dubious Joy did in my Mind instill.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>While thus I cow'r'd beneath his piercing Eye,</L>
<L>He saw, and strove to mitigate my Fear,</L>
<L>Soft'ning the Frown of harsh Austerity</L>
<L>In his bold Brow, which Nature grafted there.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>With Speeches kind he cheer'd my sinking Heart,</L>
<L>Question'd me much, and stroak'd my drooping Head;</L>
<L>Yet his whole Mind he seem'd not to impart,</L>
<L>His Looks implied more than his Speeches said.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>A broider'd Purse, which weighty seem'd with Gold,</L>
<L>He gave me then, and kindly press'd my Hand;</L>
<L>And thus awhile did stay me in his Hold,</L>
<L>And on my Face did meditating stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="27">
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>XXVII.</HEAD>
<L>His Soul work'd hugely, and his Bosom swell'd,</L>
<L>As though some mighty Thing he yearn'd to say,</L>
<L>But (with indignant Pride the Thought repell'd)</L>
<L>He started, frown'd, and snatch'd himself away.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="28">
<HEAD>XXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>My Guide return'd, and re-conducted me</L>
<L>Tow'rd the Abode of my Preceptor kind;</L>
<L>A Man he seem'd of Carriage mild and free,</L>
<L>To whom I thought I might unload my Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="29">
<HEAD>XXIX.</HEAD>
<L>Without Reserve I told him all that pass'd,</L>
<L>Striving, by mine, his Confidence to gain;</L>
<L>Then my Enquiries frank before him cast,</L>
<L>Hoping some Knowledge of myself t'attain.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="30">
<HEAD>XXX.</HEAD>
<L>I ask'd what wond'rous Cause, yet undiscry'd,</L>
<L>Urg'd him his Time and Zeal for me t'employ;</L>
<L>And why that Man of Dignity and Pride</L>
<L>Had deign'd his Notice to a Stranger-Boy.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="31">
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>XXXI.</HEAD>
<L>Confus'd, yet undispleas'd, my Guide appear'd,</L>
<L>Nought he divulg'd (tho' much he seem'd to know)</L>
<L>Save this, which he with earnest Look aver'd,</L>
<L>"No Obligation, Youth, to me you owe;</L>
</LG>
<LG N="32">
<HEAD>XXXII.</HEAD>
<L>"I do but what my Place and Duty bid,</L>
<L>"With me no Kindred-Drops of Blood you share,</L>
<L>"Yet (hard to tell!) your Birth must still be hid;</L>
<L>"Enquire no farther—Honour bids, forbear."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="33">
<HEAD>XXXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Thus he reprov'd, yet did it with a Look,</L>
<L>As tho' he pitied my Sensations keen;</L>
<L>Patient I bow'd me to his mild Rebuke,</L>
<L>And pledg'd Obedience, with submissive Mien.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="34">
<HEAD>XXXIV.</HEAD>
<L>He left me at my Tutor's soft Abode,</L>
<L>And parting bless'd me by the <HI>holy Cross;</HI></L>
<L>My Heart wax'd sad, as he re-trac'd the Road,</L>
<L>And seem'd to have sustain'd some mighty Loss.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="35">
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
<HEAD>XXXV.</HEAD>
<L>But soon tumultuous Thoughts began give Way,</L>
<L>Lull'd by the Voice of my Preceptor sage;</L>
<L>Unquiet Bosoms he could well allay,</L>
<L>His Looks could soften, and his Words assuage.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="36">
<HEAD>XXXVI.</HEAD>
<L>Unruly Care from him was far remov'd,</L>
<L>Grief's wildest Murmurs at his Breath would cease;</L>
<L>O! in his blameless Life how well he prov'd</L>
<L>The House of Goodness is the House of Peace!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="37">
<HEAD>XXXVII.</HEAD>
<L>Here I again enjoy'd my sweet Repose,</L>
<L>And taught my Heart, with pious Wisdom fill'd,</L>
<L>No more with anxious Throb to seek disclose</L>
<L>What stubborn Fate had doom'd to lie conceal'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="38">
<HEAD>XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>But long these fond Delusions did not last,</L>
<L>Some sterner Pow'r my rising Life controul'd,</L>
<L>My visionary Hopes too swiftly past,</L>
<L>And left my Prospects dreary, dark, and cold.</L>

<L>Thou royal Issue of PLANTAGENET! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not, perhaps, be unacceptable to some of our Readers, if we subjoin the Etymology of this Name, which has been borne by several of our English Kings. GEORGE BUCK, Esq. Compiler of the Life of RICHARD the <HI>Third,</HI> in KENNET's History of <HI>England,</HI> says, it rather should be called, PLANTAGENEST, being derived from the two Words, <HI>Planta Genesta</HI> or <HI>Genista,</HI> that is, the Plant, <HI>Broom.</HI> It was first given to FULKE, Earl of <HI>Anjou,</HI> who lived an hundred Years before the Norman Conquest. He, having been guilty of some enormous Crimes, was en∣joined, by Way of Penance, to go to the Holy Land, and submit to a severe Castigation. He readily acquiesced, dressed himself in lowly Attire, and, as a Mark of Humility, wore a Piece of <HI>Broom</HI> in his Cap, of which Virtue this Plant is a Symbol, in the Hyeroglypick Language; and VIRGIL seems to confirm it, by calling it <HI>humilis Genista, the humble Broom.</HI> This Expiation finished, FULKE, in Remembrance of it, adopted the Title of <HI>Plantagenest,</HI> and lived many Years in Honour and Happiness. His Descendants accordingly inherited the Name, and many successive Nobles of the Line of <HI>Anjou</HI> not only did the same, but even distinguished themselves by wearing a Sprig of <HI>Broom</HI> in their Bonnets.</NOTE></L>

<P>"RICHARD PLANTAGENET was buryed the 22d Daye of <HI>December,</HI> 1550."</P>
<P>This last Piece of Intelligence was transmitted to the Editor by a very sensible and worthy Clergyman now living, who kindly went from <HI>Wye</HI> to <HI>Eastwell,</HI> to collect as many Circumstances as he could, to confirm the Authenticity of this singular Story. To the Transcript of the Register he subjoined as follows:</P>
<Q><P>It is observable that in the old Register there is prefixed to the Name of every Person of <HI>noble Blood</HI> such a Mark as this, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>. At the Name of RICHARD PLANTAGENET there is the same Mark, (and it is the First that is so distinguished) only with this Difference, that there is a Line run across it, thus <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>.</P>
<P>There is still remaining in <HI>Eastwell-Park</HI> the Ruin of a Building, which, they say, was his House; and a Well near it, which, to this Day, is called PLANTAGENET's Well.</P>
<P>There is also a Tomb in the Wall of <HI>Eastwell-Church,</HI> under which he is said to be buried, but it appears to me of much older Date.</P></Q>
<P>The Editor of this Poem holds it incumbent on him to return his most grateful Thanks to the Gentleman who sent him these curious Particulars, for the Trouble he took, and the Politeness of his Letter; the whole of which he should be proud to make publick, together with the Name, could he presume such a Liberty to be warrantable.</P>
<P>The Editor conjectures the Line, which is mentioned to run across the Mark of Nobility, to be what is stiled in Heraldry, <HI>the Bar of Bastardy.</HI></P></NOTE></L>
