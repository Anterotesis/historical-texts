<P>It is nothing for you, Sir—it is a card for my mistress, from Madam Mulroony; her man gave it me as I came in.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, let me see it— "Mrs. Mul∣roony makes her compliments to Mrs. Murrogh O'Dogherty, and likewise to Mr. Murrogh O'Dogherty, and hopes to have the favour of their company on Sunday the 17th instant, to play at cards, sup, and spend the evening, with Lady Kinnegad, Mrs. Cardmark, Miss Brag, Mr. Mushroom, Cornet Basilisk, Sir Anthony All-Night, Major Gamble, and a very jolly party."—Here, John, take it to your mistress—I have nothing to say to it. <STAGE>(<HI>Exit</HI> John)</STAGE>—Well done Mrs. Mulroony—faith, and it well becomes your father's daughter, and your husband's wife, to play at cards upon a Sunday. She is another of the fine ladies of this country, who, like my wife, is sending her soul to the devil, and her husband to a gaol as fast as she can. The booby has scarce a thousand pounds a year in the world, yet he spends above two thousand in equipage, taste, high life, and jolly parties—besides what his fool of a wise loses to that female sharper, my Lady Kinnegad and her jolly party; which, if I may judge by my own wife, is at least a good two thousand more; so that by the rule of sub∣traction, take four thousand pounds a year out of one, and in a very little time nothing will remain but a goal, or an escape in the packet on Connaught Monday.</P>

<P>By my faith, and so am I you. Odzooks give us a kiss, man: I give you my honour I am as glad to see you in Dublin at this juncture, as I should to see a hundred head of fat bullocks upon my own land, all ready for Ballinasloe Fair.</P>

<P>Sir, your humble servant. That is a great compliment from you, brother, I know.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a very true one I assure you.</P>

<P>Well, I see by the news-papers that my sister is returned from her coronation frolie, and in health I suppose, or you would have wrote me word had it been otherwise.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, she is in health indeed, and returned with a vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is the matter?</P>

<P>Ogho! enough is the matter, the devil an inhabitant in Swift's Hospital for Luna∣tics, is in a worse pickle than she is.</P>

<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprise me!—in what respect, pray?</P>

<P>Why, with a distemper that she has brought over with her from England, which will, in a little time, I am afraid, infect the whole nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what may that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is called the Irish Fine Lady's delirium, or the London vertigo; if you were to hear her when the sit is upon her—oh, she is as mad—the devil a thing in this poor country but what gives her the spleen, and the vapours—then such a phrenzy of admiration for every thing in England—and, among the rest of her madness, she has brought over a new language with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by a new language?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why a new kind of a London Eng∣lish, that's no more like our Irish English, than a coxcomb' fine gilded chariot like a Glassmanogue noddy.—Why what name do you think she went by when she was in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what name dare she go by but Dogherty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dogherty!—ogho—upon my honour she startles when she hears the name of Dogherty, and blushes, and is as much ashamed as if a man had spoke bawdy to her.—No, no, my dear, she is no longer the plain, modest, good-natured, domestic, obedient Irish Mrs. O'Dogherty, but the travelled, rampant, high-lis'd, prancing English Mrs. Diggerty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! Mrs. Diggerty! ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ridiculous indeed! to change her name—was there ever such impertinence? But do you know, brother, among the rest of your sister's whims and madnesses, that she is turned a great politician too concerning my name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! a politician I—Why how in the name of wonder and common sense can
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
politics and the name of Dogherty be con∣nected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O it's a wonder indeed!—but strange as it is, they are connected—but very ridiculously as you may imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, prithee, by what means?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, we are to have an election shortly for the county that I live in, which young Lord Turnabout wants to carry for one of his own gang; and as the election in a great measure depends upon my interest, the young fox, knowing the conceit and vanity of my wife, has taken her by her favou∣rite soible, and tickled it up, by telling her that if I direct my interest properly, it would not be difficult to procure me a title. Now, sir, this piece of flattery has stirred up such a rage of quality and title in her giddy head, that I cannot rest night or day for her importunity—in short, she would have me desert my friends, and sell myself, my honour, and my country, as several others have done before me, merely for a title, only that she may take place of a parcel of foolish idle women, and sink the antient name of Dogherty in the upstart title of Lady Thingum, my Lady Fiddle F addle, or some such ridiculous nonsense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, pray pause a little upon this business—my sister's vanity, I grant you, may be ridiculous—but though you despise titles and oftentation, yet, as your interest can certainly make the member, were I in your circumstances, I would have a voice in the senate of my
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
country—go into parliament for the county yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ogh, I have been among them al∣ready, and I know them all very well. What signifies my sitting among hundreds of people with my single opinion all alone. When I was there before I was stigmatized as a singular blockhead, an impracticable fellow, only because I would not consent to sit like an image, and when the master of the puppets pulled the string of my jaw on one side, to say aye, and on t'other side, to say no, and to leap over a stick back∣wards and forwards, just as the faction of party and jobbers, and leaders, and political adventu∣rers directed—ah, brother, brother, I have done with them all—oh, I have done with them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and after all your expence of opposing government right or wrong, and sup∣porting your patriots, will you give them all up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I will—I was patriot mad I own, like a great many other fools in this dis∣tracted country—sir, I was so mad that I hated the very name of a courtier as much as an illite∣rate lay-swaddling methodist does that of a regular clergyman. But I am cured of that folly; for now I find that a courtier is just as honest a man as a patriot—my dear, they are both made of the same stuff; ah, I have at last found out what sort of an animal a patriot is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay!—and pray, brother, what sort of an animal is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he is a sort of a political weathercock, that is blown about by every wind of society, which the foolish people are always
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
looking up at, and staring, and distracting them∣selves with the integrity of its vicissitudes—to-day it is blown by the rough, rattling, tempest of party; next day by the trade-wind of fly, subtle, veering faction; then by the headlong hurricane of the people's hot foggy breath; huzza boys, down with the courtier, up with the patriot, 'till at last the smooth, soft, gentle warm breeze of interest blows upon it, and from that moment it rusts to a point, and never stirs after—so there is your puff patriot for you—ogh, to the devil I pitch them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! I am glad to find, brother, that you are come to that way of thinking at last, and I wish you had had the same notions years ago, it would have saved you many thou∣sands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, and that it would—however experience is an excellent tutor, and as you are a young man, and just coming into the world, mine may be of some service to you; take this judgment from me then, and remember that an honest quiet country gentleman who out of policy and humanity establishes manufactories, or that contrives employment for the idle and the industrious, or that makes but a blade of corn grow where there was none before, is of more use to this poor country than all the cour∣tiers, and patriots, and politicians, and prodigals that are unhanged;—so there let us leave them and return to my wife's business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, I long to have a particular account of her conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, brother, I have many grievances to tell you of, but I have one that's more whim∣sical than all the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you must know, brother, I am going to be a cuckold as fast as I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! that's a comical grievance indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O stay 'till you hear the story, and I'll engage you will say it is as comical a cuckoldom as ever was contrived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to find, sir, it is of so sa∣cetious a nature—pray let me hear this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sit down then, brother, for I have got a little touch of my gout, let us sit down for a moment, and I will let you into the whole affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, sir, for you have really raised my curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(sits.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, brother, there is an English coxcomb in this town just arrived among us, who thinks every woman that sees him is in love with him, and this spark, like another Paris of Troy, has taken it into his head to make a Helen of my wife, and a poor cuckoldy Menelaus of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! Pray who is the spark?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the name of this cuckold∣maker is Mushroom, but from his conceit and impertinence, the women and jokers of this town have dignified him with the title of Count Mushroom. Sir, he is the son of a pawn-broker in London, who having a mind to make a gentleman of his son, sent him to the university
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
of Oxford; where, by mixing in the follies and vices of irregular youth, he got into a most sanguine friendship with young Lord Old-Castle, who you know has a large estate in this country, and of whose ancestors mine have held long and profitable leases, which are now near ex∣piring—in short, sir, this same Count Mushroom and my Lord became the Pylades and Orestes of the age, and so very fond was my Lord of him, that out of sheer friendship to the Count, he got his sister with child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! that was friendly indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, it was what you may call modern friendship, taste, and bun tun; and my Lord being a man of gratitude, in return made him his agent in this country, and sent him over to settle his affairs here. And the Count and I being in treaty to renew the leases with my Lord, and we not being able to agree upon the terms, the coxcomb sends my wife a warm billedoux, in which he very gallantly tells her, that she shall decide the difference between us, and settle the leases at her own price, only upon the trifling condition that he may be permitted now and then to be the occasional lord of her ladyship's matrimonial manor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impudent rascal! And, pray, what says my sister to all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why she does not know a word of the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! pray how came you to be ac∣quainted with his letter then, and his designs upon my sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there is the joke: it was by the help of Katty Farrel, my wife's woman, by whose assistance I carry on a correspondence with the fellow in my wife's name, unknown to her; and by that means I shall not only detect and expose the fellow, but get an excellent bargain of the leases, which are to be signed this very day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, I hope you wont accept of leases upon those terms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I have no time to moralize with you on that point, but depend upon it I will convince you before I sleep of the propriety of my taking the leases: Lord, what signifies it; it is only a good bargain got from a foolish lord by the ingenuity of a knavish agent, which is what happens every day in this country, and in every country indeed.</P>

<P>My dear Diggerty, I kiss your hands. I am come on purpose—I beg ten thousand pardons—I understood you were alone—you are busy I presume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Count, we are not. This gentleman is a relation—my wife's brother—counsellor Hamilton, whom you have so often heard me talk of, and with whom I desire you will be acquainted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I feel a superlative happiness in being known to you, I have long expected and long wished for it with a lover's appetite; there∣fore without waiting for the dull avocation of experience, or the pedantic forms of ceremony, I beg you will honour me with a niche in your esteem, and register me in the select catalogue of your most constant and most ardent friends and admirers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear sir, you are superabundantly obliging—this is such a favour—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no—none, none—give me your hand, Hamilton, you are my friend Dig∣gerty's friend, and that's enough—I'll serve you—say no more—I'll serve you—rely upon me—I live in this town quite en famille—I go about every where, am of no party but those of love,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
pleasure and gallantry—the women like and command me at cards, tea, scandal and dancing—the men, at wit, hazard, jolly parties, a late hour and a bottle—I love ease, hate ceremony, and am at home wherever I go—that's my system, Hamilton—ha, is not that taste, life, philosophy, and summum bonum—ha, my dear, at home wherever I go, an't I, Diggerty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, indeed, to give you your due, Count, you are never bashful in any place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, never, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith, nor none of your family I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! never, never, my dear Diggerty—bashfulness is a mark of ignorance, an uncourtly, vulgar disease—what we men of the world are never infected with—but, my dear Diggerty, I am come on purpose to settle with you; my attorney with the leases is below, for as I know my lord would be loth to lose you as a tenant, and as I am convinced it would be for his interest you should have the lands, why we will even sign and seal at once upon your own terms—for really I think tenants in Ireland want encouragement—they are rack'd too high—they are indeed—it is a shame they should be rack'd so high.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Count, there's many a true word poke in jest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour I am serious—you want encouragement in trade too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you really think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do upon my honour, and I will speak to some people of consequence about it on the other side, as soon as I return.</P>

<P>I will upon my honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O aye, you politicians promise us the devil and all while you are among us, but the moment you get o't'other side, you have devilish bad memories.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to like Ireland, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>O immensely, sir—it is a damn'd fine country, sir — and excellent claret — excellent claret upon my honour! 'tis true indeed it is not such claret as we drink in London—however, upon the whole, it's a pretty, neat, light, soft, silky, palateable wine, and I like it mightily—but your fish in this here country is horrid. There you want taste, Hamilton—that there is an article of the scavoir vivre, in which you are totally ignorant—quite barbarous—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! in what respect, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my dear Hamilton, how can you ask such a question—you, you, now—who have been in London!—why you eat all your fish here too noo—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too noo?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all too noo—why you eat it the very day—nay, sometimes the very hour it comes out of the water—now that there is a total want of taste—quite barbarous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, brother, we eat all our fish in this here country too noo—too noo a great deal. Now, I fancy, Count, we should keep
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
our fish before we dress it, as you keep your venison, till it has got the hot gout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha!—the hot gout—ha, ha, ha!—Oh, I shall expire—my dear Diggerty, I honour your hot gout—but your French is a little en Irlandois—en Provence—haut gout is the word.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, Dublin, after seeing London, looks like Irish-Town or Ring's-End: Oh, every thing I set my eyes on here gives me the ennui, and the countre cure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, every thing here gives her the contre coeur; that is a disease she has brought

over with her from London that we know nothing of here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dig.</SPEAKER>
<P>The streets are so narrow, the houses so dirty, and the people so ridiculous! then the women, Count! ha, ha, ha!—I can't help laughing when I think of them. Well, I am convinced that the women of this here country who have never travelled, have nothing of that—a—a—non-chalance, and that jenny-see-quee that we have in London.</P>

<P>Indeed you may take your oath I don't, my dear.</P>

<P>And so, as I was saying, Count, we had a great storum, and the picket—I shall never forget it—the picket landed us about

twenty miles from Dublin—and so, do you know, I say, Mushroom, that I fancied, being just come from England, that the very dogs here when they barked, had the brogue, ha, ha, ha!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dig.</SPEAKER>
<P>He, he, he! O shocking! don't neem them together—now that is so Irish—but, brother, what would have afforded you the highest entertainment, was the city feast. O that there was imminse.</P>

<P>No, indeed, the court never stirred without her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dig.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the lord mayor made a point of having me there: so I went with her Grace, a friend of mine, and a party of the court, as one of the houshold—but the minute I went in every eye was upon me: Lord, it was veestly pleasant to see how the she grocers, the she mercers, the she dyers, the she hosiers, and the she taylors did stare at me—I was very brilliant that's certain—rather more so than I was at the wedding.</P>

<P>O pray, Mr. Diggerty, be quiet, and don't interrupt me.—Well, but, brother, as I was saying, it was imminsely entertaining to hear the awkward city creatures whisper and give their vardee upon me, in their city manner—Lord, is this the handsome Irish woman?—the famous Irish toast? the celebrated Mrs. Dig∣gerty—ha!—I don't think she is so handsome, says one—hum!—well enough, says another, only I don't like her nose—pray, doesn't she squint? says a third—O yes, she certainly squints, says a fourth—and she is a little crooked—but she is genteel—O yes, yes, the city creatures all allowed I was genteel.</P>

<P>Mr. Diggerty, I will hear no reason; there can be no reason against what I say—you are the strangest man—not be a lord—sir, I insist upon it—there's a necessity for a peerage.</P>

<STAGE>(cries)</STAGE>
Mrs. Diggerty's servants there—Mrs. Diggerty's chair there—Mrs. Diggerty's coach there—it is so mean and beggarly I cannot bear it—the very thought of it makes me ready to burst my stays, and almost throws me into my hysterics.</P>

<P>Pooh, pooh! nobody minds what you say—you are always abusing every body in power—well, sir, you see the English are im∣proving in teest every day, and have their bur∣lettas and their operas, their Cornelys, their Almacks, their macaronies—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my dear, I tell you again and again, that the English can never be precedent to us. They, by their genius and constitution, must always run mad about something or other, either about burlettas, pantomimes, a man in a bottle, a Cock-lane ghost, or something of equal importance. But, my dear, they can afford to run mad after such nonsense; why they owe more money than we are worth; stay 'till we are as rich as they are, and then we may be allowed to run mad after absurdities as well as they.</P>

<P>Why, sir, ever since I returned to this odious country I have been requesting and begging, and praying, that you would send to London only for the set of long-tailed horses, that I told you I admired so—but no, I cannot prevail, though you know my Lady Kilgobbin, my Lady Balruddery, my Lady Castleknock, and, in short, every lady of figure all run upon long tails—nobody but doctors, apothecaries, lawyers, cits, and country squires drive with short tails now—for my part, you know I detest a short tail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Dogh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, I have sent for your brother to town, on purpose to settle all these points between us, and if he thinks it proper that you should have long tails, you may have them as long as my Lady Kilgobbin's, my Lady Balruddery's tails, or any tails in the universe; and as to the title, if it can be had, why we will submit that to him likewise.</P>

<P>What do you mean, sir?</P>

<P>I will tell you, madam—you are not ignorant that your husband took you without a fortune; that he generously gave the little our father left you to your younger sister, with the benevolent addition of two thousand pounds—you know too, that by marriage articles, upon a separation or your husband's death, you are entitled only to a hundred pounds a year; which cautious pittance his prudence wisely insisted on, as a necessary check upon the conduct of giddy, female youth, and thoughtless vanity, when matched with the tempered age of sobriety and discretion—now, madam, I am commissioned to inform you, that the doors are open, and that the stipulated sum will be punctually paid you, as your vicious appetite shall demand; for know, that neither your husband's love, my affection, nor a residence in this house can be enjoyed by you another hour, but on the hard condition of a thorough reformation.</P>

<P>Ogh, that's right, Nancy—O'Dogh∣erty for ever—O'Dogherty!—there's a found for you—why they have not such a name in all England as O'Dogherty—nor as any of our fine sounding Milesian names—what are your Jones and your Stones, your Rice and your Price, your Heads and your Foots, and Hands and your Wills, and Hills and Mills, and Sands, and a parcel of little pimping names that a man would not pick out of the street, compared to the O'Donovans, O'Callaghans, O'Sullivans, O'Brallaghans, O'Shaghnesses, O'Flahertys, O'Gallaghers, and O'Doghertys,

—Ogh, they have courage in the very sound of them, for they come out of the mouth like a storm; and are as old and as stout as the oak at the bottom of the bog of Allen, which was there before the flood—and though they have been dispossessed by upstarts and foreigners, buddoughs and sassanoughs, yet I hope they will flourish in the Island of Saints, while grass grows or water runs.</P>

<P>O dear Mrs. Jolly—</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Bab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I am like an old house newly painted and white-washed, and I stink of rappee. I think a little rappee would not be amiss to clear your eyes, and refresh your spirits, and there is some for you.</P>

<P>O dear Lady Bab, this is <HI>(sneezes)</HI> cruel—<HI>(sneezes)</HI> indelicate—<HI>(sneezes)</HI> and intolerable—<HI>(sneezes)</HI> but I beg you will let me out of this consinement.</P>

<P>Indeed I will not, for I intend that other people shall enjoy your situation as well as I—this is Lady High-Life's night—all the world is there—so here, John, take this portmantle

<P>Now, gentlemen and ladies, you may go plunder one another at cards and dice as fast as you can—and, like the Count, make your∣selves objects for a farce.—If every fine lady and coxcomb in this town were turned into a farce, faith we should be the merriest people in all Europe—but ours is over for to-night, and pretty well upon the whole.</P>
</SP>
<P>Indeed, I think 'tis very fairly ended: The coxcomb's punish'd; The fine Irish lady's mended.</P></STAGE>
