<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first our bard advent'rous left the shore,</L>
<L>To tempt the drama's depth, untry'd before;</L>
<L>With beating heart his trembling sail he rear'd,</L>
<L>While critic sands and envious rocks he fear'd.</L>
<L>But your indulgence swell'd the prosp'rous wind,</L>
<L>And sase convey'd him to the port design'd.</L>
<L>The track, yourselves approv'd, he now pursues,</L>
<L>And for a second trip his care renews.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft, in the silent hours of teeming thought,</L>
<L>As flatt'ring prospects in his bosom wrought,</L>
<L>Hope imag'd to his sight your starting tear,</L>
<L>And brought the welcome plaudit to his ear!</L>
<L>But while he now revolves that mutual fame</L>
<L>Should join the poet's and the actor's name,</L>
<L>O! let him here one tender tribute pay,</L>
<L>To early worth, untimely snatch'd away!</L>
<L>To HIM, who once, alas! his scene inspir'd,</L>
<L>Whose softness melted, and whose spirit fir'd!</L>
<L>While to the friend this grateful debt he pays,</L>
<L>Each gen'rous breast will sure confirm the praise;</L>
<L>With you, his honest zeal must stand approv'd,</L>
<L>Which makes this off'ring to the man he lov'd!</L>

<L>The setting sun</L>

<L>Thou know'st long since the oracle requir'd</L>
<L>A virgin's life in annual sacrifice;</L>
<L>And every year, on this returning day,</L>
<L>In solemn rites our weeping Thrace gives up</L>
<L>The melancholy victim.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not yet—and thence</L>
<L>I fear new evils may arise: 'tis whisper'd,</L>
<L>I know not what, of something that portends</L>
<L>Contest and tumult to the state: Mathusius,</L>
<L>The hoary chief, beneath whose fostering care</L>
<L>Our young Timanthes learn'd the trade of war,</L>
<L>Grown old in toils, an alien to the court,</L>
<L>Now lives sequester'd, since the king displeas'd</L>
<L>Recall'd him from command, and in his stead</L>
<L>Left his brave son to guide the Thracian files:</L>
<L>Retir'd he dwells, where on the city's skirts</L>
<L>The sea in tempests breaks; or where, in calms;</L>
<L>Its glassy waves reflect the trembling towers;</L>
<L>With him resides his daughter fair Ismena.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORCANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>The coldness 'twixt Demophoon and Mathusius</L>
<L>Has reach'd the public notice; born to shine</L>
<L>In camps alone, Mathusius has not learnt</L>
<L>The soft address to rise in courts.</L>

<L>'Tis true,</L>

His temper's warmth, which oft, by youth inflam'd,</L>

<L>Is form'd of softer mould; yet both possess</L>
<L>Demophoon's heart; and born of different queens,</L>
<L>He in Timanthes seems to prize the gifts</L>
<L>Of manly fortitude, while in Cherinthus</L>

<SPEAKER>DEMOPHOON.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well—Mathusius' absence on the eve</L>
<L>Of this important day, when he should meet</L>
<L>My conquering son, the pupil of his arms,</L>
<L>Argues a stubbornness and disregard</L>
<L>A sovereign ill can brook: we own his deeds,</L>
<L>His years of service for the state;—but tell</L>
<L>The all-presuming man, that merit, self</L>
<L>O'er-rated, cancels its reward—Adrastus,</L>
<L>Ought hears't thou of Cherinthus?</L>

<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, my liege,</L>
<L>But to the Thracian port, the fav'ring winds</L>

<L>Forgive a subject's freedom, but you seem</L>

<SPEAKER>DEMOPHOON.</SPEAKER>
<L>The time, Adrastus,</L>
<L>Now calls for meditation, and how few</L>

Are a king's hours of peace, whose every day</L>
<L>Teems with some counsel for the public weal.</L>

<L>Yet this auspicious day my king must own</L>

<L>Adds to his father's brow new wreaths of fame,</L>
<L>And to his people gives the palms of peace.</L>
<L>No, sacred sir, the hardy sons of Thrace</L>

<L>Thanks to heaven,</L>

I may, without a blush, confess my deeds:</L>
<L>Yes, we have conquer'd; never view'd the sun</L>
<L>A more extensive slaughter: 'midst the tumult</L>
<L>Of fear and rage, were blended undistinguish'd</L>
<L>The brave, the base, the victor and the vanquish'd.</L>
<L>The day at length was ours; if you demand</L>

<L>In this embrace receive my pledge of love:</L>
<L>Thy father welcomes thee—proceed, my son,</L>
<L>Urge on thy course to honour's furthest goal,</L>

<L>Thou canst not tell</L>
<L>How dear I hold thee—to the toil of arms</L>
<L>Love gives its soft relief, and beauty best</L>
<L>Smooths the rough front of war: tho' now my years</L>
<L>Roll forward, and the summer of my life</L>

<L>Forgot not softer hours of peace and love,</L>
<L>Think'st thou, Ismena, 'midst these shades, that oft</L>

<SPEAKER>TIMANTHES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forgive the fondness of o'erflowing love</L>

<L>The precious pledge of our connubial joys,</L>

<L>Some God, that watches o'er this pledge of love,</L>

<L>Alas! my lord, awhile suppress these warm</L>
<L>Paternal feelings—some few miles remote,</L>
<L>Sequester'd from the city, on the edge</L>
<L>Of the rude forest, Arcas and Ianthe,</L>
<L>A rustic pair, unconscious of their charge,</L>
<L>Rear his young life—Amidst the observing eyes</L>
<L>That watch a prince's deeds, you must beware,</L>
<L>And but with caution see him—Heav'n allows</L>
<L>To us with scanty hand the parent's joys,</L>

<SPEAKER>ISMENA.</SPEAKER>
<L>It is indeed:</L>

<L>'Tis so decreed,—and think not that I fear</L>
<L>To die for Thrace—no, for her country's sake,</L>
<L>Ismena gladly would embrace her doom.</L>
<L>But Phoebus' words demand a virgin's blood;</L>
<L>Shall I, a wife and mother, dare approach</L>
<L>His sacred altar, an unhallow'd victim?</L>
<L>Thus, if I speak or not, I still am guilty,</L>
<L>My silence heav'n offends, my speech the king.</L>

<SPEAKER>TIMANTHES.</SPEAKER>
<L>The king must know the secret of our nuptials:</L>
<L>All, all demands is now—for, O Ismena,</L>
<L>This very hour perhaps Cherinthus brings</L>
<L>A rival to thy love—Cephisa comes;</L>
<L>But now Demophoon urg'd me to receive</L>
<L>The Phrygian princess—but, be witness heav'n!</L>
<L>Not all the cruel policy of courts,</L>

<L>The partial error—Thrace, some future day,</L>

<SPEAKER>CEPHISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>WHAT means this sadness, prince? With silent gaze</L>
<L>You look and sigh, and if with friendly speech</L>
<L>I urge your converse, when you seem prepar'd</L>
<L>To tell me much, your fault'ring tongue is mute.</L>
<L>Where is your wonted chearfulness? the grace</L>
<L>That season'd your discourse? Are you in Thrace</L>
<L>The same Cherinthus that I knew in Phrygia?</L>
<L>Or is it thus, with melancholy looks,</L>
<L>You Thracians to her lord conduct a bride?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHERINTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>If my afflictions bear a sad presage,</L>
<L>On me, fair princess, every evil fall:</L>
<L>My stars can little add to griefs like mine,</L>
<L>Nor breathes a wretch so hopeless as Cherinthus.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CEPHISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And claims Cephisa then so little share</L>
<L>In your esteem! The time has been—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHERINTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forgive</L>
<L>This cold reserve—and yet believe me, fair-one,</L>
<L>There is a something here commands my silence.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>CEPHISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis true, I am a woman, and your secret</L>
<L>Were ill confided to our sex's weakness.</L>
<L>I urge no further—lead me to the palace.</L>

<SPEAKER>CHERINTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet hear—those eyes like light'ning pierce my soul,</L>
<L>And all my firm resolves are lost before them.</L>
<L>O! turn, Cephisa, and with gentler looks</L>
<L>Unbend those brows, while trembling I confess,</L>
<L>'Tis thou hast robb'd me of my peace—I gaze</L>
<L>With rapture on thy matchless charms; I own</L>
<L>My love is fruitless all, that these fond wishes</L>
<L>Would grasp they know not what: I know that death</L>
<L>Alone can end my pains.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CEPHISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What means Cherinthus!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHERINTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I knew too well I should offend—And yet</L>
<L>The faults of love—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CEPHISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forbear—I'll hear no more.—</L>
<L>Is this the brother of Timanthes? This</L>
<L>The prince deputed by the Thracian king?</L>
<L>And is it thus Cherinthus thinks to guard</L>
<L>That faith a brother and a father claim?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHERINTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I own my crime—I know that every tie</L>
<L>Of son and brother should forbid my passion.</L>
<L>Why was I only singled by Demophoon,</L>
<L>To bring thee to Timanthes? Could I view</L>
<L>Thy charms, and yet resist?—I saw and lov'd.</L>
<L>Each day beheld me near thee, while the name</L>
<L>Of kinsman gave a license to my tongue:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="22"/>
Nor did this name alone deceive the world,</L>
<L>I was deceiv'd myself—that love, which made</L>
<L>Me sigh for ever for Cephisa's presence,</L>
<L>Appear'd but duty, and a thousand times</L>
<L>I thought to paint the affections of a brother,</L>
<L>While my too eager speech betray'd my own.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CEPHISA.</SPEAKER>

<L>Alas! 'twas not in vain—Cephisa too</L>
<L>Perceiv'd a something she would fain disown.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHERINTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet sometimes I felt a flattering hope:</L>
<L>Methought I oft observ'd a tender sigh</L>
<L>Steal from thy breast, view'd in thy eyes a softness</L>
<L>That seem'd much more than friendship—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CEPHISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hold, Cherinthus,</L>
<L>Thou dost begin to abuse my easy nature.</L>
<L>It ill befits the daughter of Nicanor,</L>
<L>Affianc'd to Timanthes, heir of Thrace,</L>
<L>To hear with calmness these injurious vows,</L>
<L>At once destructive to her peace and fame.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHERINTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forgive me, princess, and I will obey;</L>
<L>Thou shalt no more reproach my daring love,</L>
<L>Injurious to thy glory—Spite of all</L>
<L>The pangs that rend my heart, conviction's force</L>
<L>Dwells in thy words, and I'll no more offend.</L>
<L>No, I will strive to wear the face of joy,</L>

<L>We have a son, the dear, the only offspring</L>

<L>Nought can extenuate—have I not destroy'd</L>
<L>A father's peace, and stain'd a royal race</L>
<L>With blackest infamy—by horrid love</L>
<L>Impell'd, did I not trample on the laws,</L>
<L>And leap the bound, that seem'd by heaven design'd</L>
<L>To stop the dreadful union—has not rage</L>

<L>Now by the love</L>
<L>You bear Cherinthus, by those awful powers</L>
<L>That view the soul's recess, whose justice marks</L>
<L>The deed of hood-wink'd fate from the black dye</L>
<L>Of voluntary guilt, whose pity still</L>
<L>May sooth thy future life—</L>

<L>My future life!—</L>
<L>Shall I then live to aggravate my crime</L>
<L>To love—for, O! with horror I confess</L>
<L>I cannot shake Ismena from my soul—</L>

<L>Yes, Timanthes,</L>

<L>Thou wert exchang'd an infant for Ismena;</L>
<L>Argea, baffled in her hopes to give</L>
<L>An heir to Thrace, first by Arsene's birth,</L>
<L>And next Ismena's, from Mathusius' wife</L>
<L>Receiv'd, and gave thee to me as her own;</L>
<L>But verging on the brink of life, she left</L>
<L>A paper with Barcene, to produce,</L>
<L>If aught of danger should attend Ismena,</L>
<L>That paper which Mathusius gave thee first,</L>
<L>While in the houshould temple she dispos'd</L>
<L>This second scroll which has reveal'd thy birth.</L>

From your embrace—you spurn'd Ismena too—</L>

<L>Our sufferings past shall be the grateful theme</L>
<L>Of many a future hour—Olinthus oft</L>

<L>Mathusius, yes—thou still hast days of joy:</L>

<L>The innocent usurper: thus we stand</L>
<L>Deliver'd from the annual sacrifice;</L>
<L>Cherinthus shall succeed—in him, Cephisa,</L>

<BYLINE>Written by GEORGE COLMAN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WHAT horrors fill the tragic poet's brain!</L>
<L>Plague, murder, rape, and incest, croud his train;</L>
<L>He pants for miseries, delights in ills,</L>
<L>The blood of fathers, mothers, children, spills;</L>
<L>Stabs, poisons, massacres; and, in his rage,</L>
<L>With daggers, bowls, and carpets, strews the stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our gentler poet, in soft opera bred,</L>
<L>Italian crotchets singing in his head,</L>
<L>Winds to a prosp'rous end the fine-drawn tale,</L>
<L>And roars—but roars like any nightingale.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woman, whate'er she be—maid, widow, wife,</L>
<L>A quiet woman is the charm of life:</L>
<L>And sure Cephisa was a gentle creature,</L>
<L>Fuil of the milk and honey of good-nature.</L>
<L>Imported for a spouse—by spouse refus'd!</L>
<L>Was ever maid so shamefully abus'd?</L>
<L>And yet, alas, poor prince! I could not blame him—</L>
<L>One wife, I'knew, was full enough to tame him.</L>
<L>Ismena, and Timanthes, and Olinthus,</L>
<L>Might all be happy—for I chose Cherinthus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what a barb'rous law was this of Thrace!</L>
<L>How cruel <HI>there</HI> was each young lady's case!</L>
<L>A virgin, plac'd upon the dreadful roll,</L>
<L>A hapless virgin must have stood the poll,</L>
<L>But by Timanthes made a lucky bride,</L>
<L>Ismena prudently <HI>disqualify'd.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ladies, to you alone our author sues;</L>
<L>'Tis yours to cherish, or condemn his muse.</L>
<L>The theatre's a mirror, and each play</L>
<L>Should be a very looking-glass, they say;</L>
<L>His looking-glass reflects no moles or pimples,</L>
<L>But shews you full of graces, smiles, and dimples.</L>
<L>If you approve yourselves, resolve to spare,</L>
<L>And, critics! then attack him, if ye dare.</L>
