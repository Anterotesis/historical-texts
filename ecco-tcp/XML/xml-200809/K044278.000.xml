<P>THE School for Wives.</P>
<P>A COMEDY.</P>
<P>AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>LONDON: PRINTED FOR T. BECKET, IN THE STRAND. 1774.</P>
<P>[PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIX-PENCE.]</P>

<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following performance cannot commit it to the press, without acknow∣ledging the deepest sense of gratitude, for the un∣common marks of approbation with which he has been honoured by the Public.</P>
<P>Tho' he has chosen a title us'd by MOLIERE, he has neither borrowed a single circumstance from that great poet, nor to the best of his recollection from any other writer.—His chief study has been to steer between the extremes of sentimental gloom, and the excesses of uninteresting levity; he has some laugh, yet he hopes he has also some lesson; and fashionable as it has been lately for the wits,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
even with his friend Mr. Garrick at their head, to ridicule the Comic Muse, when a little grave, he must think that she degenerates into farce, where the grand business of instruction is neglected, and consider it as a heresy in criticism, to say that one of the most arduous tasks within the reach of literature, shou'd, when executed; be wholly without utility.</P>
<P>The Author having been presumptuous enough to assert, that he has not purloin'd a single sprig of bays from the brow of any other writer, he may, perhaps, be ask'd, if there are not several plays in the English language, which, before his, produced Generals, Lawyers, Irishmen, Duels, Masque∣rades, and Mistakes? He answers, yes; and con∣fesses moreover, that all the Comedies before his, were compos'd not only of men and women, but that before his, the great business of comedy con∣sisted in making difficulties for the purpose of re∣moving them; in distressing poor young lovers; and in rendering a happy marriage the object of every catastrophe.</P>
<P>Yet tho' the Author of the School for Wives, pleads guilty to all these charges, still, in extenuation of his offence, he begs leave to observe, that having
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
only men and women to introduce upon the stage, he was oblig'd to compose his Dramatis Personae of mere flesh and blood; if, however, he has thrown this flesh and this blood, into <HI>new</HI> situations; if he has given a <HI>new</HI> fable, and plac'd his characters in a point of light hitherto unex∣hibited:—he flat.ters himself that he may call his play, a <HI>new</HI> play, and tho' it did not exist before the creation of the world, like the famous Welch pedigree, that he may have some small pretensions to originality.</P>
<P>Two things besides the general moral incul∣cated thro' his piece, the Author has attempted; the first, to rescue the law, as a profession, from ridicule or obliquy; and the second, to remove the imputation of a barbarous ferocity, which dra∣matic writers, even meaning to compliment the Irish nation, have connected with their Idea of that gallant people:—The law, like every other profession, may have members who occasionally disgrace it; but to the glory of the British name, it is well know that in the worst of times, it has produced numbers whose virtues reflected honour upon human nature; many of the noblest privileges the constitution has to boast of, were derived from the integrity, or the wisdom of lawyers:
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
Yet the stage has hitherto cast an indiscriminate stigma upon the whole body, and laboured to make that profession either odious or contemptible in the theatre, which, if the laws are indeed dear to good Englishmen, can never be too much respected in this kingdom. There is scarcely a play in which a lawyer is introduced, that is not a libel upon the long robe; and so ignorant have many dramatic writers been, that they have made no distinction whatever, between the characters of the first Barri∣sters in Westminster-Hall, and the meanest solicitors at the Old Bailey.</P>
<P>With respect to the gentlemen of Ireland, where even an absolue attempt is manifested, to place them in a favourable point of view, they are drawn with a brutal promptitude to quarrel, which is a dis∣grace to the well known humanity of their coun∣try.—The gentlemen of Ireland have doubtless a quick sense of honour, and, like the gentlemen of England, as well as like the gentlemen of every other high-spirited nation, are perhaps unhappily too rea∣dy to draw the sword, where they conceive themselves injured—But to make them proud of a barbarous propensity to Duelling; to make them actually de∣light in the effusion of blood, is to fasten a very unjust reproach upon their general character, and to ren∣der
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
them universally obnoxious to society. The author of the School for Wives therefore, has given a different picture of Irish manners, though in humble life, and flatters himself that those who are really acquainted with the original, will acknow∣lege it to be at least a tolerable resemblance.</P>
<P>It would be ungrateful in the highest degree to close this preface, without acknowleging the very great obligations which the author has to Mr. Garrick. Every attention, which either as a ma∣nager, or as a man, he could give to the interest of the following play, he has bestowed with the most generous alacrity; but universally admired as he is at present, his intrinsic value will not be known, till his loss is deplored; and the public have great reason to wish, that this may be a very distant event in the annals of the theatre. The Epilogue sufficiently marks the masterly hand from which it originated; so does the comic commencement of the Prologue, and the elegant writer of the graver part, is a character of distinguished eminence in the literary republic.</P>
<P>It has been remarked with great justice, that few new pieces were ever better performed than <HI>The School for Wives.</HI> Mr. King, that highly-deserving
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
favourite of the town, was every thing the author could possibly wish in General Savage. Mr. Red∣dish acquired a very considerable share of merited reputation in Belville. Mr. Moody is unequalled in his Irishmen. Mr. Palmer, from his manner of supporting Leeson, was entitled to a much better part: And Mr. Weston in Torington was admi∣rable. Miss Younge, in Mrs. Belville, extorted applause from the coldest auditor. Her ten∣derness—her force—her pathos, were the true effusions of genius, and proved that she has no superior where the feelings are to be interested. With respect to Mrs. Abington, enough can never be said. The elegance, the vivacity, the critical nicety with which she went through Miss Wal∣singham, is only to be guessed at, by those who are familiar with the performance of that exquisite ac∣tress. Her Epilogue was delivered with an anima∣tion not to be conceived, and manifested the strict propriety, with which she is called the first priestess of the Comic Muse in this country.</P>

<L>That fine-spun spirits from the slightest cause,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>HA! ha! ha! Well, Miss Walsingham, this fury is going; what a noble peal she has rung in Belville's ears!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did she see you, Captain Savage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I took care of that; for tho' she is'n't married to my father, she has ten times the influence of a wife, and might injure me not a little with him, if I didn't support her side of the question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a pleasant conceit of Mr. Bel∣ville, to insinuate the poor woman was disordered in her senses!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you observe how the termagant's violence of temper, supported the probability of the charge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, she became almost frantic in re∣ality, when she found herself treated like a mad∣woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Belville's affected surprise too, was admi∣rable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the hypocritical composure of his countenance, and his counterfeit pity for the poor woman, were intolerable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>While that amiable creature, his wife, im∣plicitly believed every syllable he said—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And felt nothing but pity for the ac∣cuser, instead of paying the least regard to the accu∣sation. But pray, is it really under a pretence of getting the girl upon the stage, that Belville has taken away Mrs. Tempest's neice from the people she boarded with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is: Belville, ever on the look out for fresh objects, met her in those primitive regions of purity, the Green-Boxes; where, discovering that she was passion∣ately desirous of becoming an actress, he improved his acquaintance with her, in the fictitious character of an Irish manager, and she eloped last night, to be, as she imagines, the heroine of a Dublin theatre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, then, as he has kept his real name artfully conceal'd, Mrs. Tempest can at most but suspect him of Miss Leeson's seduction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of no more; and this, only, from the description of the people who saw him in company with her at the play; but, I wish the affair may not have a serious conclusion; for she has a brother, a very spirited young fellow, who is a council in the Temple, and who will certainly call Belville to an account, the moment he hears of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what will become of the poor creature after he has deserted her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know that Belville is generous to pro∣fusion, and has a thousand good qualities to counter-balance this single fault of gallantry, which con∣taminates his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You men! you men!—You are such wretches that there's no having a moment's satisfac∣tion with you! and what's still more provoking, there's no having a moment's satisfaction without you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, don't think us all alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll endeavour to deceive myself; for it is but a poor argument of your sincerity, to be the confidant of another's falsehood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no more of this, my love; no peo∣ple live happier than Belville and his wife; nor is there a man in England, notwithstanding all his levity, who considers his wife with a warmer degree of affection: if you have a friendship therefore, for her, let her continue in an error, so necessary to her repose, and give no hint, whatever, of his gallantries to any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I had no pleasure in obliging you, I have too much regard for Mrs. Belville, not to follow your advice; but you need not enjoin me so strongly on the subject, when you know I can keep a secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are all goodness; and the prudence with which you have conceal'd our private engage∣ments, has eternally oblig'd me; had you trusted the secret even to Mrs. Belville, it wou'dn't have been safe; she wou'd have told her husband, and he is such a rattleskul, that, notwithstanding all his regard for me, he wou'd have mention'd it in some moment of levity, and sent it in a course of circulation to my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The peculiarity of your father's tem∣per, join'd to my want of fortune, made it necessary for me to keep our engagements inviolably secret; there is no merit, therefore, either in my prudence, or in my labouring assiduously to cultivate the good opinion of the General; since both were so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eces∣sary
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
to my own happiness; don't despise me for this acknowledgement now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bewitching softness!—But your goodness, I flatter myself, will be speedily rewarded; you are now such a favourite with him, that he is eternally talking of you; and I really fancy he means to pro∣pose you to me himself: for, last night, in a few mi∣nutes after he had declared you would make the best wife in the world, he seriously ask'd me if I had any aversion to matrimony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that was a very great concession indeed, as he seldom stoops to consult any body's inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it was, I assure you; for, in the army, being used to nothing but command and obedience, he removes the discipline of the parade into his family, and no more expects his orders shou'd be dis∣puted, in matters of a domestic nature, than if they were deliver'd at the head of his regiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Mrs. Tempest, who you say is as much a storm in her nature as her name, is dis∣puting them eternally.</P>

<P>You have had some of our usual daily visi∣tors for money, I suppose?</P>

<P>You may say that; and three or four of them are now hanging about the door, that I wish handsomely hang'd any where else, for bodering us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>No joking, Connolly! my present situation is a very disagreeable one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, and so it is; but who makes it disa∣reeable? your Aunt Tempest would let you have as much money as you please, but you won't condescend to be acquainted with her, though people in this country can be very intimate friends, without seeing one anothers faces for seven years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think me base enough to receive a favour from a woman, who has disgraced her family, and stoops to be a kept mistress? you see, my sister is already ruin'd by a connection with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, a good guinea isn't the worse for coming through a bad hand; if it was, what would become of us lawyers? and by my soul, many a high head in London would, at this minute, be very low, if they hadn't recieved favours even from much worse people than kept mistresses.</P>

<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Others, Connolly, may prostitute their honour, as they please; mine is my chief possession, and I must take particular care of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour, to be sure, is a very fine thing, Sir; but I don't see how it is to be taken care of, without a little money; your honour, to my know∣ledge, has'n't been in your own possession these two
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
years, and the devil a crum can you honestly swear by, till you get it out of the hands of your creditors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have given you a licence to talk, Con∣nolly, because I know you faithful; but I hav'n't given you a liberty to sport with my misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I'd die to serve you, Sir; but of what use is your giving me leave to spake, if you oblige me to hould my tongue? 'tis out of pure love and affection that I put you in mind of your misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Connolly, a few days will, in all pro∣bability, enable me to redeem my honour, and to re∣ward your fidelity; the lovely Emily, you know, has half consented to embrace the first opportunity of flying with me to Scotland, and the paltry trifles I owe, will not be miss'd in her Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Sir, consider you are going to fight a duel this very evening, and if you shou'd be kilt, I fancy you will find it a little difficult, to run away afterwards with the lovely Emily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I fall, there will be an end to my mis∣fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely it will not be quite genteel, to go out of the world without paying your debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But how shall I stay in the world, Connolly, without punishing Belville for ruining my sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, the devil fly away with this honour; an ounce of common sense, is worth a whole ship load of it, if we must prefer a bullet or a halter, to a fine young lady and a great fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll talk no more on the subject at pre∣sent. Take this letter to Mr. Belville; deliver it into his own hand, be sure; and bring me an answer: make haste; for I shall not stir out till you come back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>By my soul, I wish you may be able to stir out then, honey.—O, but that's true!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, Sir, the gentleman I last liv'd clerk

with, died lately and left me a legacy of twenty guineas—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! is Mr. Stanley dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, his friends have behav'd very unkindly if he is not, for they have buried him these six weeks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I received my little legacy this morning, and if you'd be so good as to keep it for me, I'd be much oblig'd to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Connolly, I understand you, but I am already shamefully in your debt: you've had no money from me this age.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, that does not signify; if you are not kilt in this damn'd duel, you'll be able enough to pay me: if you are, I shan't want it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, my poor fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, tho' I am but your clerk, and tho' I think fighting the most foolish thing upon earth, I'm as much a gintleman as yourself, and have as much right to commit a murder in the way of duelling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then? You have no quarrel with Mr. Belville?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall have a damn'd quarrel with him tho' if you are kilt: your death shall be reveng'd, de∣pend upon it, so let that content you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Connolly, I hope I shan't want such a proof of your affection.—How he distresses me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will want a second, I suppose, in this affair: I stood second to my own brother, in the Fif∣teen Acres, and tho' that has made me detest the very thought of duelling ever since; yet if you want a friend, I'll attend you to the field of death with a great deal of satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Connolly, but I think it ex∣tremely wrong in any man who has a quarrel, to ex∣pose
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
his friend to difficulties; we shou'dn't seek for redress, if we are not equal to the task of fighting our own battles; and I choose you particularly, to carry my letter because, you may be supposed ignorant of the contents, and thought to be acting only in the ordinary course of your business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more about it, honey; I will be back with you presently.

<P>How strangely this affair of Mrs. Tem∣pest hangs upon my spirits, tho' I have every reason, from the tenderness, the politeness, and the genero∣sity of Mr. Belville, as well as from the woman's behaviour, to believe the whole charge the result of a disturb'd imagination.—Yet suppose it should be ac∣tually true:—heigho!—well, suppose it shou'd;—I wou'd endeavour—I think I wou'd endeavour to keep my temper:—a frowning face never recovered a heart that was not to be fix'd with a smiling one:—but wo∣men, in general, forget this grand article of the ma∣trimonial

<P>You are a very strange man, Belville; you are for ever tremblingly solicitous about the hap∣piness

of your wife, yet for ever endangering it by your passion for variety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there is certainly a contradiction be∣tween my principles and my practice; but, if ever you marry, you'll be able to reconcile it perfectly. Pos∣session, Savage! O, possession, is a miserable whetter of the appetite in love! and I own myself so sad a fellow, that though I wou'dn't exchange Mrs. Bel∣ville's mind for any woman's upon earth, there is scarcely a woman's person upon earth, which is not to me a stronger object of attraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then perhaps in a little time you'll be weary of Miss Leeson?</P>

<P>To be sure I shall; though to own the truth, I have not yet carried my point conclusively with the little monkey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why how the plague has she escap'd a moment in your hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a mere accident.—She came to the lodg∣ings, which my man Spruce prepar'd for her, rather un∣expectedly last night, so that I happened to be en∣gaged particularly in another quarter—you under∣stand me—and the damn'd aunt found me so much employment all the morning, that I could only send a message by Spruce, promising to call upon her the first moment I had to spare in the course of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so your are previously satisfied that you shall be tired of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tir'd of her?—Why I am at this moment in pursuit of fresh game, against the hour of satiety:—Game that you know to be exquisite! and I fancy I shall bring it down, though it is closely guarded by a deal of that pride, which passes for virtue with the generallity of your mighty good people.</P>

<P>Indeed! and may a body know this wonder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A very happy dog, truly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's a delicious girl, is'n't she, Savage?— but she'll require a little more trouble;—for a fine woman, like a fortified town, to speak in your fa∣ther's language, demands a regular siege; and we must even allow her the honours of war, to magnify the greatness of our own victory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it amazes me how you gay fellows ever have the presumption to attack a woman of principle; Miss Walsingham has no apparent levity of any kind about her.</P>
</SP>

<P>What is the English of these significant looks between Spruce and you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only that Miss Walsingham is left alone, and that I have now an opportunity of entertaining her; you must excuse me, Savage; you must upon my soul; but not a word of this affair to any body; because when I shake her off my hands, there may be fools enough to think of her, upon terms of ho∣nourable matrimony.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, here's a discovery! a precious disco∣very! and while I have been racking my imagina∣tion, and sacrificing my interest, to promote the happiness of this woman, she has been listening to the addresses of another; to the addresses of a mar∣ried man! the husband of her friend, and the imme∣diate friend of her intended husband!—By Belville's own account, however, she has not yet proceeded to any criminal lengths—But why did she keep the affair a secret from me? or why did she continue in his house after a repeated declaration of his unwarrantable attachment?—What's to be done?—If I open my engagement with her to Belville, I am sure he will in∣stantly desist;—but then her honour is left in a state extremely questionable—It shall be still concealed— While it remains unknown, Belville will himself tell me every thing;—and doubt, upon an occasion of this nature, is infinitely more insupportable than the downright falsehood of the woman whom we love.</P>

<P>ZOUNDS! Torrington, give me quarter, when I surrender up my sword: I own that for these twenty years, I have been suffering all the incon∣veniences of marriage, without tasting any one of its comforts, and rejoicing in an imaginary freedom, while I was really grovelling in chains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the dirtiest chains upon earth;—yet you wou'dn't be convinc'd, but laugh'd at all your mar∣ried acquaintance as slaves, when not one of them put up with half so much from the worst wife, as you were oblig'd to crouch under, from a kept mis∣tress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis too true. But, you know, she sacrificed much for me;—you know that she was the widow of a colonel, and refus'd two very advantageous matches on my account.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she was the widow of a judge, and had re∣fused a high chancellor, she was still a devil incar∣nate, and you were of course a madman to live with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't remember her care of me when I have been sick.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I recollect, however, her usage of you in health, and you may easily find a tenderer nurse, when you are bound over by the gout or the rheumatism.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I agree with you that she is a devil incarnate; but I am this day determin'd to part with her for ever.</P>

<P>What, don't I know my own mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not you indeed, when she is in the question; with every body else, your resolution is as unalterable as a determination in the house of peers; but Mrs. Tempest is your fate, and she reverses your decrees with as little difficulty as a fraudulent debtor now-a-days procures his certificate under a commission of bankruptcy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well if, like the Roman Fabius, I conquer by delay, in the end, there will be no great reason to find fault with my generalship. The proposal of parting now comes from herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you darn't make it for the life of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know that this morning we had a smart cannonnading on Belville's account, and she threatens, as I told you before, to quit my house if I don't challenge him for taking away her neice.</P>

<P>That fellow is the very devil among the women, and yet there isn't a man in England fonder of his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poh, if the young minx hadn't surrender'd to him, she would have capitulated to somebody else, and I shall at this time be doubly obliged to him, if he is any ways instrumentall in getting the aunt off my hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why at this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because to shew you how fix'd my resolution is to be a keeper no longer, I mean to marry im∣mediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can't you avoid being press'd to death, like a felon who refuses to plead, without incurring a sentence of perpetual imprisonment?</P>
</SP>

to a perpetual imprisonment in the arms of Miss Walsingham.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have you any reason to think that upon examination in a case of love, she would give a fa∣vourable reply to your interrogatories?</P>
</SP>

<P>The greatest—do you think I'd hazard such an engagement without being perfectly sure of my ground? Notwithstanding my present connection won't suffer me to see a modest woman at my own house—She always treats me with particular attention whenever I visit at Belville's, or meet her any where else—If fifty young fellows are present, she directs all her assiduities to the old soldier, and my son has a thousand times told me that she professes the highest opinion of my understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And truly you give a notable proof of your understanding, in thinking of a woman almost young enough to be your grand-daughter.</P>

<P>Well, if I am blown up by my own mine, I shall be the only sufferer—There's another thing I want to talk of, I am going to marry my son to Miss Moreland.</P>

<P>O, ay, I remember that Moreland had got a good estate to assume the name of Belville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have'nt yet mention'd the matter to my son, but I settled the affair with the girl's mother yesterday, and she only waits to communicate it to Belville, who is her oracle, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are you sure the captain will like her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not so unreasonable as to insist upon his liking her, I shall only insist upon his marrying her.</P>

<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Moreland has thirty thousand pounds— That's a large sum of ammunition money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but a marriage merely on the score of fortune, is only gilding the death-warrant sent down for the execution of a prisoner. However as I know your obstinate attachment to what you once resolve, I shan't pretend to argue with you; where are the papers which you want me to consider?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are in my library—File off with me to the next room and they shall be laid before you— But first I'll order the chariot, for the moment I have your opinion, I purpose to sit down regularly before Miss Walsingham—who waits there?</P>

<P>I beg, Sir, that you will insult me no lon∣ger with solicitations of this nature—Give me proofs of your sincerity indeed! What proofs of sincerity can your situation admit of, if I could be even weak enough to think of you with partiality at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If our affections, Madam, were under the government of our reason, circumstanced as I am, this unhappy bosom wouldn't be torn by passion for Miss Walsingham.—Had I been bless'd with your acquaintance, before I saw Mrs. Belville, my hand as well as my heart, wou'd have been humbly of∣fer'd to your acceptance—fate, however, has or∣dered it otherwise, and it is cruel to reproach me with that situation as a crime, which ought to be pitied as my greatest misfortune.</P>

<P>He's actually forcing tears into his eyes.—However, I'll mortify him severely.

caused.—Only, therefore, say that you commiserate my sufferings—I'll ask no more—and surely that may be said, without any injury to your purity, to snatch even an enemy from distraction—where's my handkerchief?

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll despise me for this weakness.</P>

<P>This weakness—this generosity which will demand my everlasting gratitude.</P>

<P>I am a fool—but there is a kind of fatality in this affair—and I do consent to go off with you.</P>

<P>Fly to any part of the world indeed—you shall fly by yourself then;
<STAGE>(<HI>aside.</HI>)</STAGE>
You are the

most lovely, the most tender creature in the world, and thus again let me thank you: O, Miss Wal∣singham, I cannot express how happy you've made me!—But where's the necessity of our leaving Eng∣land?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought he wouldn't like to go abroad—

That I may possess the pleasure of your company unrival'd.</P>

<P>I must cure her of this taste for travelling—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't answer, Mr. Belville?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I was turning the consequence of your proposal in my thoughts, as going off—going off— you know.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why going off, you know, is going off— And what objections can you have to going off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why going off, will subject you at a cer∣tainty, to the slander of the world; whereas by staying at home, we may not only have numberless oppor∣tunities of meeting, but at the same time prevent suspi∣cion it self, from ever breathing on your reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I didn't dream of your starting any difficulties, Sir.—Just now I was dearer to you than all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you are, by heav'n!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why won't you sacrifice the world then at once to obtain me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, my dearest life, you must know the necessity, which every man of honour is under of keeping up his character?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, here's this fellow swearing to ten thousand lies, and yet talking very gravely about his honour and his character.
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
Why, to be sure in these days, Mr. Belville, the instances of conjugal infidelity are so very scarce, and men of fashion are so remarkable for a tender attachment to their wives, that I don't wonder at your circumspection—But do
<PB N="24" REF="37"/>
you think I can stoop to accept you by halves, or admit of any partnership in your heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>O you must do more than that, if you have any thing to say to me.
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
Surely, Madam, when you know my whole soul unalterably your own, you will permit me to preserve those appearances with the world, which are indispensibly requisite—Mrs. Bel∣ville is a most excellent woman, however it may be my fortune to be devoted to another—Her happiness, besides, constitutes a principal part of my felicity, and if I was publicly to forsake her, I should be hunted as a monster from society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, I suppose, it is by way of pro∣moting Mrs. Belville's repose, Sir, that you make love to other women; and by way of shewing the nicety of your honour, that you attempt the pu∣rity of such as your own roof, peculiarly, intitles to protection. For the honour intended to me—thus low to the ground, I thank you, Mr. Belville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laugh'd at, by all the stings of mortification▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good bye.—Don't let this accident mortify your vanity too much;—but take care, the next time you vow everlasting love, that the object is neither tender enough to sob—sob—at your dis∣tress; nor provoking enough to make a proposal of leaving England.—How greatly a little common sense can lower these fellows of extraordinary impudence?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(alone.)</STAGE>
So then, I am fairly taken in, and she has been only diverting herself with me all this time:— however, lady fair, I may chance to have the laugh in a little time on my side; for if you can sport in this manner about the flame, I think it must in the run lay hold of your wings:—what shall I do in this affair?—she sees the matter in its true light, and there's no good to be expected from thumping of bosoms, or squeezing white handkerchiefs;—no these

won't do with women of sense, and in a short time, they'll be ridiculous to the very babies of a board∣ing-school.</P>

<P>No, then it must be damn'd bad indeed! but prith'ee, hurry to an explanation.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why then, the worst part of the affair is, that she was laughing at me the whole time; and made this proposal of an elopement, with no other view, than to shew me in strong colours to myself, as a very dirty fellow to the best wife in England.</P>

<P>My dear Miss Walsingham, it is rather cruel that you should be left at home by yourself, and yet I am greatly rejoic'd to find you at present with∣out company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't but think myself in the best company, when I have the honour of your conver∣sation, General.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You flatter me too much, Madam; yet I am come to talk to you on a serious affair, Miss Wal∣singham; an affair of importance to me and to your∣self: Have you leisure to favour me with a short au∣dience, if I beat a parley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any thing of importance to you, Sir, is always sufficient to command my leisure.—'Tis as the Captain suspected.
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You tremble, my lovely girl, but don't be alarmed; for though my business is of an important nature, I hope it won't be of a disagreeable one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I am greatly agitated.

<P>Soldiers, Miss Walsingham, are said to be generally favour'd by the kind partiality of the ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ladies are not without gratitude, Sir, to those who devote their lives peculiarly to the service of their country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generously said, Madam: Then give me leave, without any masked battery, to ask, if the heart
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
of an honest soldier is a prize at all worth your ac∣ceptance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, there's no mask∣ed battery in this question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am as fond of a coup de main, Madam, in love, as in war, and hate the tedious method of sap∣ping a town, when there is a possibility of entering sword in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Sir, a woman may as well know her own mind, when she is first summoned by the trumpet of a lover, as when she undergoes all the tire∣some formality of a siege. You see I have caught your own mode of conversing, General.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a very great compliment I consider it, Madam: But now that you have candidly confess'd an acquaintance with your own mind, answer me with that frankness for which every body admires you so much. Have you any objection to change the name of Walsingham?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then frankly, General Savage I say, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten thousand thanks to you for this kind declaration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you won't think it a forward one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd sooner see my son run away in the day of battle;—I'd sooner think Lord Russell was bribed by Lewis the XIVth, and sooner villify the memory of Algernoon Sidney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How unjust it was ever to suppose the General a tyrannical father!
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have told me condescendingly, Miss Walsingham, that you have no objection to change your name, I have but one question more to ask.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray propose it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would the name of Savage be disagreeable to you?—Speak frankly again, my dear girl!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then again I frankly say, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make me too happy; and though I shall readily own, that a proposal of this nature would come with more propriety from my son—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much better pleas'd that you make the proposal yourself, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too good to me.—Torrington thought that I should meet with a repulse.
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you communicated this business to the Captain, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear Madam, I did not think that at all necessary. I have always been attentive to the Captain's happiness, and I propose that he shall be married in a few days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, whether I will or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O you can have no objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must be consulted, however, about the day, General: but nothing in my power shall be wanting to make him happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obliging loveliness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may imagine, that if I was not previously imprest in favour of your proposal, it wou'd not have met my concurrence so readily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you own that I had a previous friend in the garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't blush to acknowledge it, when I consider the accomplishments of the object, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O this is too much, Madam; the principle merit of the object is his passion for Miss Walsing∣ham.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't say that, General, I beg of you, for I don't think there are many women in the king∣dom, who could behold him with indifference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, you flattering, flattering angel!—and yet, by the memory of Marlborough, my lovely girl, it was the idea of a prepossession on your part, which encouraged me to hope for a favourable re∣ception.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must have been very indiscreet, for I labour'd to conceal that prepossession as much as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cou'dn't conceal it from me! you cou'dn't conceal it from me!—The female heart is a field which I am thoroughly acquainted with, and which has more than once been a witness to my vic∣tories, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't at all doubt your success with the ladies, General; but as we now understand one another so perfectly, you will give me leave to retire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>One word, my dear creature, and no more; I shall wait upon you sometime to day, with Mr. Torrington, about the necessary settlements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must do as you please, General, you are invincible in every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if you please, we'll keep every thing a profound secret, 'till the articles are all settled, and the definitive treaty ready for execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be sure, that delicacy will not suffer me to be communicate on the subject, Sir.</P>

<P>WELL, Mrs. Belville, I am ex∣tremely glad you agree with me, in opinion of this young lady's qualifications for the stage. Don't you think she'd play Miss Headstrong admirably in my comedy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, I think she possesses a natural fund of spirit, very much adapted to the character.—'Tis impossible, surely, that this hoy∣den can have a moment's attraction for Mr. Belville?</P>
</SP>

</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> RACH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Osbaldiston is not your real name, perhaps?</P>

<P>I don't say but that I am strongly wounded by his irregularities. Yet if Mr. Belville is unhappily a rover, I wou'd much rather that he should have twenty mistresses than one.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and weary the innocent sun and moon from the firmament, like a despairing princess in a tragedy—No—no—Lady Rachel, 'tis bad enough to be indifferent to the man I love, without studying to excite his aversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> RACH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How glad I am that Miss Walsing∣ham made him so heartily asham'd of himself: Lord, these young men are so full of levity: Give me a husband of Mr. Torrington's age, say I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And give me a husband of Mr. Bel∣ville's, say I, with all his follies: However, Lady Rachel, I am pretty well satisfied that my conduct at Miss Leeson's will have a proper effect upon Mr. Bel∣ville's generosity, and put an entire end to his ga∣lantries for the future.</P>

<P>Why should you, think so of such a man as Mr. Belville?</P>
</SP>

<P>O, Connolly, a man of spirit should learn prudence from his very pride, and consider every unnecessary debt he contracts as a wanton diminution of his character! the moment he makes another his creditor—he makes himself a slave! He runs the ha∣zard of insults, which he never can resent, and of disgraces which are seldom to be mitigated! He in∣curs the danger of being dragg'd, like the vilest fe∣lon to the felon's prison! and, such is the depravity of the world, that guilt is even more likely to meet with advocates, than misfortune!

I don't wonder that he is so much afraid of a prison, for to be sure it is a blessed place to live in; and a blessed law it must be, which coops a man up from every chance of getting money, by way of making him pay his debts—But now let my thick skull consider, if there is any method of preventing this infernal duel. Suppose I have him

bound over to the pace! No, that will never do—it would be a shameful thing for a gintleman to keep the pace! Besides, I must appear in the business, and people may think, from my connexion with him, that he has not honour enough to throw away his life: Suppose I go another way to work, and send an anonymous letter about the affair to Mrs. Belville: They say, though she is a woman of fashion, that no creter upon earth can be fonder of her husband. Surely the good genius of Ireland put this scheme into my head—I'll about it this minute; and if there's only one of them kept from the field, I don't think that the other can be much hurt, when there will be no body to fight with him.

<P>Nay, but General, let me interpose here. If he can maintain any charge against the lady's repuation, 'twould be very hard that he should be disinherited, for a necessary attention to his honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if I don't make the charge good, I submit to be disinherited without murmurring.</P>
</SP>

<P>'Tis false as hell! the lady is infinitely too good for you, in every respect; and I undervalued her worth, when I thought of her for your wife.</P>

<P>I am sure the lady is much oblig'd to your favourable opinion, Sir.</P>

<P>Not in the least, Madam; I only do her common justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I cannot bear that you shou'd be displeas'd a moment, Sir; suffer me therefore to render the con∣versation less equivocable, and a few words will ex∣plain every thing.</P>

<P>I am shock'd at the brutality of the dog; he has no more principle than a suttler, and no more steadiness than a young recruit upon drill. But, you shall have ample satisfaction:—this very day I'll cut him off from a possibility of succeeding to a shilling of my fortune. He shall be as miserable as—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear General, do you think that this wou'd give me any satisfaction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How he became acquainted with my design I know not, but I see plainly, that his mutiny pro∣ceeds from his aversion to my marrying again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To your marrying again, Sir! why shou'd he object to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, for fear I should have other children, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, it was not from that mo∣tive; and, if I can overlook his folly, you may be prevail'd upon to forgive it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>After what you have seen, justice shou'd make you a little more attentive to your own interest, my lovely girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What at the expence of his?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the approaching change of your situation, there may be a family of your own.</P>

<P>Suppose there shou'd, Sir; won't there be a family of his too?</P>
</SP>

<P>I care not what becomes of his family.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray let me think a little about it, General.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis hard, indeed, when I was so desirous of promoting his happiness, that he should throw any thing in the way of mine.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recollect, Sir, his offence was wholly confin'd to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my love, and isn't it throwing an obstacle in the way of my happiness, when he abuses you so grosly for your readiness to marry me?</P>

<P>Why really, Sir, this affair affects me strongly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it is possible, that for your sake, I may not punish him with as much severity as I intended: In about an hour I shall beg leave to beat up your quarters again, with Mr. Torrington; for 'tis neces∣sary I should shew you some proof of my gratitude, since you have been so kindly pleas'd to honour me with a proof of your affection.</P>

<SPEAKER>CAPT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, there is no occasion to be so much alarm'd; Mr. Belville has very properly deter∣min'd not to fight; he told me so himself, and should have been effectually prevented, if I hadn't known his resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no knowing to what extremities he may be provok'd, if he meets Mr. Leeson; I have sent for you, therefore, to beg that you will save him from the possibility, either of exposing himself to any danger, or of doing an injury to his adversary.</P>

<P>Merciful heaven! where is the generosi∣ty, where is the sense, where is the shame of men, to find a pleasure in pursuits, which they cannot re∣member without the deepest horror; which they can∣not follow without the meanest fraud; and which they cannot effect, without consequences the most dreadful? The single word, Pleasure, in a masculine sense, com∣prehends every thing that is cruel; every thing that is base; and every thing that is desperate: Yet men, in other respects, the noblest of their species, make it the principal business of their lives, and do not hesi∣tate to break in upon the peace of the happiest fami∣lies, though their own must be necessarily expos'd to destruction.—O Belville! Belville!—my life! my love!—The greatest triumph which a libertine can ever experience, is too despicable to be envied; 'tis at best nothing but a victory over his own humanity; and if he is a husband, he must be dead indeed, if he is not doubly tortured upon the wheel of recollection.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Mrs. Belville, I am ex∣tremely unhappy to see you so distress'd.</P>
</SP>

<P>Now, I am extremely glad to see her so, for if she wasn't greatly distress'd it wou'd be monstrously unnatural.</P>

<P>O, Matilda!—my husband! my hus∣band! my children! my children!</P>
</SP>

<P>Don't weep, my dear! don't weep! pray be comforted, all may end happily. Lady Rachel, beg of her not to cry so.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> RACH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you are crying yourself, Miss Walsingham; and tho' I think it out of character to encourage her tears, I can't help keeping you company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, why is not some effectual method contriv'd, to prevent this horrible practice of duelling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> RACH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll expose it on the stage, since the law now a-days, kindly leaves the whole cognizance of it to the theatre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet if the laws against it, were as well enforced as the laws against destroying the game, perhaps it would be equally for the benefit of the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No law will ever be effectual till the custom is render'd infamous.—Wives must shriek! —mothers must agonize!—orphans must multiply! unless some blessed hand strips the fascinating glare from honourable murder, and bravely exposes the idol who is worship'd thus in blood. While it is disreputable to obey the laws, we cannot look for reformation:—But if the duellist is once banished from the presence of his sovereign;—if he is for life excluded the confidence of his country;—if a mark of indelible disgrace is stamp'd upon him, the sword of publick justice will be the sole chastiser of wrongs; trifles will not be punish'd with death, and offences really meriting such a punishment, will be reserv'd for the only proper avenger, the common executioner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> RACH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'dn't have express'd myself bet∣ter on the subject, my dear: but till such a hand as you talk of is found, the best will fall into the error of the times.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy I am rather before the time of ap∣pointment; engagements of this kind are the only ones, in which, now-a-days, people pretend, to any punctuality:—a man is allow'd half an hours law to dinner, but a thrust through the body must be given within a second of the clock.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Leeson.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, Sir.—Your name I suppose is Belville?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your supposition is very right, Sir; and I fancy I am not much in the wrong, when I suppose your name to be Leeson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, Sir; I am sorry I shou'd keep you here a moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry, Sir, you shou'd bring me here at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I regret the occasion, be assured, Sir; but 'tis not now a time for talking, we must proceed to action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet talking is all the action I shall pro∣ceed to, depend upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, Sir? Where are your pistols?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where I intend they shall remain till my next journey into the country, very quietly over the chim∣ney in my dressing room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You treat this matter with too much levity, Mr. Belville; take your choice of mine, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd rather take them both, if you please, for then no mischief shall be done with either of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, this trifling is adding insult to injury; and shall be resented accordingly. Didn't you come here to give me satisfaction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, every satisfaction in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take one of these pistols then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Mr. Leeson, your bravery will not at all be lessen'd by the exercise of a little understand∣ing: If nothing less than my life can atone for the injury I have unconsciously done you, fire at me in∣stantly, but don't be offended because I decline to do you an additional wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'death, Sir, do you think I come here with an intention to murder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You come to arm the guilty against the inno∣cent, Sir; and that, in my opinion, is the most atrocious intention of murder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's this?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'e, Mr. Leeson, there's your pistol
<STAGE>(throws it on the ground)</STAGE>
I have already acted very wrongly with respect to your sister, but, Sir, I have some character (though perhaps little enough) to maintain, and I will not do a still worse action, in raising my hand against your life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>This hypocrital cant of cowardice, Sir, is too palpable to disarm my resentment; though I held you to be a man of profligate principles, I neverthe∣less consider'd you as a man of courage; but, if you hesitate a moment longer, by heaven, I'll chastise you on the spot.
<STAGE>(Draws.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must defend my life; though if it did not look like timidity, I would inform you—
<STAGE>(they fight, Leeson is disarmed)</STAGE>
—Mr. Leeson, there is your sword again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strike it through my bosom, Sir;—I don't desire to out-live this instant,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, my dear Sir, that you will long live
<PB N="58" REF="71"/>
happy—as your sister, tho' to my shame I can claim no merit on that account, is recovered unpolluted, by her family; but let me beg that you will now see the folly of decisions by the sword, when success is not fortunately chain'd to the side of justice: Before I leave you, receive my sincerest apologies for the in∣juries I have done you; and, be assured, no occur∣rence will ever give me greater pleasure, than an op∣portunity of serving you, if, after what is past, you shall at any time condescend to use me as a friend.
<STAGE>Ex.</STAGE></P>

<P>Very well—very well—very well.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you have been within hearing, I sup∣pose?</P>

<SP>

<P>You may say that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And isn't this very fine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I can't say much as to the finery of it, Sir, but it is certainly very foolish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so this is my satisfaction after all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and pretty satisfaction it is. When Mr. Belville did you but one injury, he was the greatest vil∣lain in the world; but now that he has done you two, in drawing his sword upon you, I suppose he is a very worthy gentleman</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be foil'd, baffled, disappointed in my revenge!—What tho' my sister is by accident unstain'd, his intentions are as criminal, as if her ruin was actu∣ally perpetrated; there is no possibility of enduring the reflection!—I wish not for the blood of my enemy, but I would at least have the credit of giving him life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arrah, my dear, if you had any regard for the life of your enemy, you shou'dn't put him in the way of death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more of these reflections, my dear Con∣nolly; my own feelings are painful enough. Will you be so good as to take these damn'd pistols, and come with me to the coach?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Troth and that I will; but don't make your∣self
<PB N="59" REF="72"/>
uneasy; consider that you have done every thing which honour required at yous hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know so: You have broke the laws of heaven and earth, as nobly as the first lord in the land, and you have convinc'd the world, that where any body has done your family one injury, you have courage enough to do it another yourself, by hazarding your life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those, Connolly, who would live reputably in any country, must regulate their conduct in many cases by its very prejudices.—Custom, with respect to duelling, is a tyrant, whose despotism no body ven∣tures to attack, tho' every body detests its cruelty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I didn't imagine that a tyrant of any kind would be tolerated in England. But where do you think of going now? For chambers, you know, are at present most delightfully dangerous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall go to Mrs. Crayon's.</P>

<P>Mrs. Crayons will, I dare say, oblige me in this exigency with an apartment for a few days; but come, Connolly, we have no time to lose, tho' if you had any prudence, you would abandon me in my pre∣sent situation.</P>

<P>Now for the rejoinder to this replication.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is unquestionably true, General, and perhaps a good deal more; but in reality my confusion before you on this subject to day, was such, that I scarcely knew what I said; I was dying with distress, and at this moment am very little better;— permit me to retire, General Savage, and only suffer me to add, that tho' I think myself highly flatter'd by your addresses, it is impossible for me ever to receive them. Lord! Lord! I am glad its over in any manner.

<P>That we have found pretty recently; how∣ever, in this land of liberty, none are to be pronounc∣ed guilty, 'till they are positively convicted; I can't therefore find against Miss Walsingham, upon the bare strength of presumptive evidence.</P>

<P>And you were only anxious to shew her in her real character to me, when I was so exceedingly offended with you.</P>

<P>Tho' you both talk this point well, I still see nothing but strong presumption against Miss Walsing∣ham: Mistakes have already happened, mistakes may happen again; and I will not give up a lady's honour, upon an evidence that wou'd not cast a common pick∣pocket at the Old Baily.</P>

<P>O she had no violence of that kind to appre∣hend from her family; therefore, Mr. Leeson, since you seem as necessary for the girl's happiness, as she seems for your's, you shall marry her here in town, with the consent of all her friends, and save yourself the trouble of an expedition to Scotland.</P>

<P>You have given me life and happiness in one day, Mr. Belville! however, it is now time you should see your sister; I know you'll be gentle with her, tho' you have so much reason to condemn her choice, and generously remember that her elopement proceeded from the great improbability there was of a beggar's ever meeting with the approbation of her family.</P>

<P>What's the reason now that I can't skip, and laugh, and rejoice, at this affair? Upon my soul my heart's as full as if I had met with some great misfor∣tune. Well, pleasure in the extreme is certainly a very painful thing: I am really asham'd of these wo∣mans drops, and yet I don't know but that I ought to blush for being asham'd of them, for I am sure no∣body's eye ever looks half so well, as when it is dis∣figured by a tear of humanity.

<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, happiness is once more mine, and the women are all going in tip-top spirits to the masquerade. Now, Mr. Belville, let me have a few words with you; Miss Walsingham, the ripe, the luxurious Miss Walsingham, expects to find you there burning with impatience:—But, my dear friend, after the occurrences of the day, can you be weak enough to plunge into fresh crimes? Can you be base
<PB N="73" REF="86"/>
enough to abuse the goodness of that angel your wife; and wicked enough, not only to destroy the innocence which is shelter'd beneath your own roof, but to ex∣pose your family perhaps again, to the danger of losing a son, a brother, a father, and a husband? The possession of the three Graces is surely too poor a recompence for the folly you must commit, for the shame you must feel, and the consequences you must hazard. Upon my soul if I struggle a little longer, I shall rise in my own opinion, and be less a rascal than I think myself:—Ay, but the object is bewitch∣ing;—the matter will be an eternal secret—and if it is known that I sneak in this pitiful manner from a fine woman, when the whole elysium of her person solicits me:—well, and am I afraid the world should know that I have shrunk from an infamous action?—A thousand blessings on you dear conscience for that one ar∣gument;—I shall be an honest man after all—Suppose, however, that I give her the meeting; that's danger∣ous;—that's dangerous:—and I am so little accustomed to do what is right, that I shall certainly do what is wrong, the moment I am in the way of temptation. Come, Belville, your resolution is not so very slender a dependance, and you owe Miss Walsingham re∣paration for the injury which you have done her prin∣ciples. I'll give her the meeting—I'll take her to the house I intended—I'll—Zounds! what a fool I have been all this time, to look for precarious satisfaction in vice, when there is such exquisite pleasure to be found at a certainty in virtue!

The situation in which I must appear before you, Ma∣dam, is certainly a very humiliating one; but I am persuaded that your generosity will be gratified to hear, that I have bid an everlasting adieu to my pro∣fligacy, and am now only alive to the virtues of Mrs. Belville.—She won't speak—I don't wonder at it, for brazen as I am myself, if I met so mortifying a re∣jection, I should be cursedly out of countenance.</P>

<P>So the covert way is clear'd at last; and you have imagin'd that I was all along negociating for this fellow, when I was gravely soliciting for myself?</P>

<P>O, Mr. Torrington, we are much oblig'd to you; you have been in town ever since last night, and only see us now by accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been very busy, Madam; but you look sadly, very sadly indeed! your old disorder the jaundice, I suppose, has been very troublesome to you?</P>

<P>Sir, you have a very extraordinary mode of complimenting your acquaintance.</P>

<P>Miss Walsingham, Capt. Savage has been telling Mr. Belville and me of a very extraor∣dinary mistake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very strange indeed, mistake on mistake.</P>

<P>A compliment from you now, Mr. Belville, is really worth accepting.</P>

<P>If I thought the affair cou'd be kept a se∣cret, by making the town over to my son, since I am utterly shut out myself—</P>

<P>If I thought that;—why mortified as I must be in giving it up, I think I cou'd resolve upon the manoeuvre, to save myself from universal ridicule: but it can't be;—it can't be; and I only double my own disappointment in rewarding the disobedience of the rascal who has supplanted me. There!—there! they are all talking of it, all laughing at me, and I shall run mad!</P>

<P>Harkee, General Savage, I believe you assert a falsehood; but if you speak the truth, give your son this moment to Miss Walsingham, and let me be fairly rid of my rival.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> RACH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Instructive! why the modern Critics say that the only business of Comedy is to make peo∣ple laugh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is degrading the dignity of letters ex∣ceedingly, as well as lessening the utility of the stage —A good comedy is a capital effort of genius, and should therefore be directed to the noblest purposes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and unless we learn some∣thing while we chuckle, the carpenter who nails a Pantomime together, will be entitled to more applause, than the best comic poet in the kingdom.</P>
