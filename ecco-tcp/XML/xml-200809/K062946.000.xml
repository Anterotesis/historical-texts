<L>YE fair, for whom the hands of Hymen weave</L>
<L>The nuptial wreath to deck your virgin brow,</L>
<L>While pleasing pains the conscious bosom heave,</L>
<L>And on the kindling cheek the blushes glow:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whose spotless soul contains the better dow'r,</L>
<L>Whose life unstain'd full many virtues vouch,</L>
<L>For whom now Venus frames the fragrant bow'r,</L>
<L>And scatters roses o'er th' expecting couch:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<L>To you I sing.—Ah! ere the raptur'd youth</L>
<L>With trembling hand removes the jealous veil,</L>
<L>Where, long regardless of the vows of truth,</L>
<L>Unsocial coyness stamp'd th' ungrateful seal,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Allow the poet round your flowing hair,</L>
<L>Cull'd from an humble vale, a wreath to twine,</L>
<L>To Beauty's altar with the Loves repair,</L>
<L>And wake the lute beside that living shrine:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That sacred shrine! where female virtue glows,</L>
<L>Where ev'n the Graces all their treasures bring,</L>
<L>And where the lily, temper'd with the rose,</L>
<L>Harmonious contrast! breathes an Eden spring:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<L>That shrine! where Nature with presaging aim,</L>
<L>What time her friendly aid Lucina brings,</L>
<L>The snowy nectar pours, delightful stream!</L>
<L>Where flutt'ring Cupids dip their purple wings:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For you who bear at mother's sacred name,</L>
<L>Whose cradled offspring, in lamenting strain,</L>
<L>With artless eloquence asserts his claim,</L>
<L>The boon of nature, but asserts in vain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say why, illustrious daughters of the great,</L>
<L>Lives not the nursling at your tender breast?</L>
<L>By you protected in his frail estate?</L>
<L>By you attended, and by you caress'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<L>To foreign hands, alas! can you resign</L>
<L>The parent's task, the mother's pleasing care?</L>
<L>To foreign hands the smiling babe consign?</L>
<L>While Nature starts, and Hymen sheds a tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When 'mid the polish'd circle ye rejoice,</L>
<L>Or roving join fantastic Pleasure's train,</L>
<L>Unheard perchance the nursling lifts his voice,</L>
<L>His tears unnotic'd, and unsooth'd his pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! what avails the coral crown'd with gold?</L>
<L>In heedless infancy the title vain?</L>
<L>The colours gay the purfled scarfs unfold?</L>
<L>The splendid nurs'ry, and th' attendant train?</L>

<L>Far better hadst thou first beheld the light,</L>
<L>Beneath the rafter of some roof obscure;</L>
<L>There in a mother's eye to read delight,</L>
<L>And in her cradling arm repose secure.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor wonder, shou'd Hygeia, blissful Queen!</L>
<L>Her wonted salutary gifts recall,</L>
<L>While haggard Pain applies his dagger keen,</L>
<L>And o'er the cradle Death unfolds his pall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The flow'ret ravish'd from its native air,</L>
<L>And bid to flourish in a foreign vale,</L>
<L>Does it not oft elude the planter's care,</L>
<L>And breathe its dying odors on the gale?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<L>For you, ye plighted fair, when Hymen crowns</L>
<L>With tender offspring your unshaken love,</L>
<L>Behold them not with rigor's chilling frowns,</L>
<L>Nor from your sight unfeelingly remove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unsway'd by fashion's dull unseemly jest,</L>
<L>Still to the bosom let your infant cling,</L>
<L>There banquet oft, an ever-welcome guest,</L>
<L>Unblam'd inebriate at that healthful spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With fond solicitude each pain assuage,</L>
<L>Explain the look, awake the ready smile;</L>
<L>Unfeign'd attachment so shall you engage,</L>
<L>To crown with gratitude maternal toil:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<L>So shall your daughters in affliction's day,</L>
<L>When o'er your form the gloom of age shall spread,</L>
<L>With lenient converse chase the hours away,</L>
<L>And smooth with duty's hand the widow'd bed:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Approach, compassionate, the voice of grief,</L>
<L>And whisper patience to the closing ear;</L>
<L>From comfort's chalice minister relief,</L>
<L>And in the potion drop a filial tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So shall your sons, when beauty is no more,</L>
<L>When fades the languid lustre in your eye,</L>
<L>When Flatt'ry shuns her dulcet notes to pour,</L>
<L>The want of beauty, and of praise, supply:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<L>Ev'n from the wreath that decks the warrior's brow</L>
<L>Some chosen leaves your peaceful walks shall strew:</L>
<L>And ev'n the flow'rs on classic ground that blow,</L>
<L>Shall all unfold their choicest sweets for you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When to th' embattled host the trumpet blows,</L>
<L>While at the call fair Albion's gallant train</L>
<L>Dare to the field their triple-number'd foes,</L>
<L>And chase them speeding o'er the martial plain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mother kindles at the glorious thought,</L>
<L>And to her son's renown adjoins her name;</L>
<L>For, at the nurt'ring breast, the <HI>hero</HI> caught</L>
<L>The love of virtue, and the love of fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<L>Or in the senate when Britannia's cause</L>
<L>With gen'rous themes inspires the glowing mind,</L>
<L>While list'ning freedom grateful looks applause,</L>
<L>Pale slav'ry drops her chain, and sculks behind:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With conscious joy the tender parent fraught,</L>
<L>Still to her son's renown adjoins her name;</L>
<L>For, at the nurt'ring breast, the <HI>patriot</HI> caught</L>
<L>The love of virtue, and the love of fame.</L>
