<HEAD>THE GOOD MILITIA MAN, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>I WAS a Plough-boy tall Sir;</L>
<L>My name was honest Dan;</L>
<L>But at my country's call, Sir,</L>
<L>I've turn'd Militia Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>So on our little green, Sir,</L>
<L>Away from all the mire,</L>
<L>I daily now am seen, Sir,</L>
<L>To cock, present, and fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>In Regimentals bright, Sir,</L>
<L>Of Scarlet I do shine,</L>
<L>With hair tied up so tight, Sir,</L>
<L>And whiten'd all so fine.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Of Maidens not a few, Sir</L>
<L>Come crouding round the green;</L>
<L>And so do Parents too, Sir;</L>
<L>The Children push between.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>There like a Soldier prime, Sir,</L>
<L>I march both quick and flow;</L>
<L>I stamp my foot in time, Sir,</L>
<L>And then kick up my toe.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Mean while, with sound so grand, Sir,</L>
<L>They beat the Rum—drum—drum;</L>
<L>Till all our valiant Band, Sir,</L>
<L>Do wish the French would come.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>But stop—methinks 'tis wrong, Sir,</L>
<L>To talk this swelling stuff;</L>
<L>For no true Soldier's song, Sir</L>
<L>Should deal in empty puff.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>I'll give you then a spice, Sir</L>
<L>(Oh now you'll like my plan)</L>
<L>Of sound and good advice, Sir</L>
<L>For each Militia Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>First then, be sound at heart, Sir,</L>
<L>Be loyal, says my Song;</L>
<L>And nobly act your part, Sir</L>
<L>To right your Country's wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Yet let no Soldier hold, Sir,</L>
<L>He merely need be stout,</L>
<L>And blunt and brave and bold, Sir,</L>
<L>And mad to fight it out;</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Your Soldier of true stamp, Sir</L>
<L>Is not like brutish Cattle;</L>
<L>And he'll be good in camp, Sir,</L>
<L>As well as good in battle.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>Unlike the looser herd, Sir</L>
<L>Each vice he'll try to crush;</L>
<L>Nor will he speak a word, Sir</L>
<L>To make a Maiden blush.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Nor will he shew his spunk, Sir,</L>
<L>By turning jolly fellow;</L>
<L>He never will be drunk, Sir,</L>
<L>No, no—nor yet be mellow.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>He counts it quite a shame, Sir</L>
<L>To hear a Soldier swear;</L>
<L>'Tis what King George would blame, Sir,</L>
<L>No doubt if he was there.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>Nor does he laugh and grin, Sir.</L>
<L>At these as petty things;</L>
<L>Your swearing is a sin, Sir</L>
<L>Against the King of Kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>For be it understood, Sir</L>
<L>He says with honest Dan,</L>
<L>"The Soldier can't be good, Sir</L>
<L>While wicked is the Man."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>Now should some saucy Tongue, Sir,</L>
<L>Here stop me for a Toast,</L>
<L>I'll give the Man I've sung, Sir,</L>
<L>"The Man that's worth a host."</L>
