<L>WHAT a strange declaration!—it gives me the spleen;</L>
<L>But 'tis what good Sir Nicholas never can mean.</L>

<SPEAKER>Sir NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not mean it, fair lady!—By Jupiter, yes!</L>
<L>And my project, you'll see, will be crown'd with success;</L>
<L>I am joyous myself, and 'tis ever my plan</L>
<L>To give those I love all the joy that I can.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>We own it—but joy is like diet, dear cousin,</L>

<L>Rare dainty distinctions!—But can I believe</L>
<L>That a woman e'er liv'd, since the wedding of Eve,</L>
<L>Whose heart (tho' most coyly her head might be carried)</L>
<L>Did not fervently wish to be speedily married?</L>
<L>Not to wound your nice ears with the name of desires</L>
<L>Which youth renders lovely, and nature inspires,</L>
<L>Your sex, from its weakness demands a defender,</L>
<L>Whom pride and affection make watchful and tender;</L>
<L>And if my fair Coz is no hypocrite grown,</L>
<L>The truth of my maxims you'll honestly own;</L>
<L>While the wars from your arms the brave Colonel detain,</L>
<L>Is the want of a husband the source of no pain?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>There, indeed, you have touch'd me a little too near,</L>
<L>My Soldier, you know, to my soul is most dear,</L>
<L>I own—and my frankness you never will blame,</L>
<L>I'd purchase his presence with ought but his fame.</L>

<SPEAKER>Sir NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well said, thou dear, honest, and warm-hearted wife;</L>
<L>For thy truth may good angels still watch o'er his life!</L>
<L>And while others the rough field of slaughter are treading,</L>
<L>Send him home full of glory, to dance at our wedding!</L>
<L>For a wedding we'll have to enliven us all,</L>
<L>And Hymen's bright altar shall warm the old hall.</L>
<L>For my Niece ere I die 'tis my wish to provide,</L>

<L>In conjugal cares 'tis too soon to embark:</L>
<L>Her bosom untouch'd by Love's dangerous dart,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>The man of her heart!—these nonsensical fancies</L>
<L>You light-headed females pick out of romances.</L>
<L>That I am no tyrant you know very well,</L>
<L>So Cousin don't teach my good Niece to rebel!</L>
<L>I am no greedy guardian, who thinks it his duty</L>
<L>On the altar of Plutus to sacrifice beauty;</L>
<L>Whose venal barbarity, justly abhorr'd,</L>
<L>Ties a lovely young girl to an old crippled lord,</L>
<L>And basely, to gain either rank or estate,</L>
<L>Makes her swear she will love, what she cannot but hate.</L>
<L>From such a protector Heaven guard my dear Niece!</L>
<L>I wish her to wed that her joys may increase;</L>
<L>And the deuce must be in the strange girl who discovers</L>
<L>No man to her mind in such plenty of lovers.</L>
<L>To no very great length will my cruelty run,</L>
<L>If from twenty admirers I bid her chuse one.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>But why, dear Sir Nicholas, why in such haste?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis thus that my projects are ever disgrac'd</L>
<L>With the false names of hurry and precipitation,</L>
<L>Because I abhor silly procrastination;</L>
<L>That thief of delight, who deludes all our senses,</L>
<L>Who cheats us for ever with idle pretences,</L>

<L>From his heart, I assure you—'tis pleasantly said;</L>

<L>The cold stream of Patience ne'er creeps in my veins,</L>
<L>But the wish my heart forms my quick spirit attains.</L>
<L>I'm none of your chill atmospherical wretches,</L>
<L>Whose affections are subject to starts and to catches;</L>
<L>Whose wish, like a weather-cock, veering about,</L>
<L>Now turns towards hope, and now changes to doubt:</L>
<L>No, mine, like the needle without variation,</L>
<L>Only looks to one point, and that point's Consummation.</L>

<L>To shew him the fields he is born to inherit;</L>
<L>Lead him round our rich woods, while my limbs are yet limber,</L>
<L>And tell the young rogue, how I've nurs'd up his timber;</L>
<L>That when the worn thread of my life is untwisted,</L>
<L>He long may remember that I have existed:</L>
<L>And when my old frame in our monument rests,</L>
<L>As he walks by my grave with a few worthy guests,</L>
<L>He thus to some warm-hearted friend may address him,</L>
<L>Here lies my odd, honest, old Uncle—God bless him!</L>

<L>Thank Heaven, dear Cousin, your hale constitution</L>

<L>To make your life happy, whate'er the condition,</L>
<L>Has been, my dear Uncle, my highest ambition;</L>
<L>To fulfil every wish that your fancy can frame,</L>
<L>Still is, as it ought to be, ever my aim:</L>

<L>With terror and pain my weak accents must falter,</L>
<L>Unless my kind stars a new lover should send me,</L>
<L>Unlike all the swains who now deign to attend me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nice wench! do you want the whole world to adore you?</L>
<L>Would you have all the men of the earth rang'd before you?</L>

<L>I will see you wed without any delay:</L>
<L>Your two fittest lovers are coming to-day;</L>
<L>Young Sapphic, whose verses delight all the fair,</L>
<L>And Dicky Decisive, Sir Jacob's next heir:</L>
<L>Both young and both wealthy, both comely and clever,</L>
<L>To gain you, no doubt, each will warmly endeavour;</L>
<L>For they come for a month, by my own invitation,</L>
<L>On purpose to found my dear girl's inclination:</L>

<L>Don't cross me, I say! nor mislead my good Niece!</L>
<L>By Jove, if she thwarts me with any caprice,</L>
<L>Like a certain old justice I'll ring up my maids,</L>
<L>And marry the first of the frank-hearted jades;</L>
<L>For perverse contradiction I never will bear,</L>

</SP>

<L>My designs you shall see, Madam, always prevail:</L>

<L>Declines every offer, to give me vexation,</L>
<L>Like my late jolly neighbour, Sir Timothy Trickum,</L>
<L>Who vindictively married the frail Molly Quickum,</L>
<L>I'll make sure of the matter, and chuse me a wife,</L>
<L>With an heir ready plac'd on the threshold of life:</L>
<L>For, as I have said, tho' a foe to restriction,</L>

<L>My heart has a thorough aversion to both:</L>
<L>Yet to make him unhappy I'm equally loth;</L>

<L>Dear Girl, your warm gratitude gives you new charms:</L>

<L>Nor loosen the bands of affection between you.</L>
<L>He merits your love, and you know he has mine;</L>
<L>Yet we somehow must baffle his hasty design,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I doubt it,</L>
<L>Yet Heaven knows how we shall manage without it;</L>
<L>For when his heart's set on a favorite scheme,</L>
<L>His ardor and haste, as you know, are extreme,</L>
<L>Like a med'cine ill-tim'd opposition is vain,</L>
<L>And inflames the disorder 'twas meant to restrain.</L>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>In his fevers indeed there is no intermission:</L>
<L>And thanks, gentle Coz! to your soft disposition!</L>
<L>So sweet and compliant your temper has been,</L>
<L>You have taught him to think contradiction a sin;</L>
<L>And here all around him confirm that belief,</L>
<L>His vassals all bow to the nod of their chief.</L>
<L>Here shut from the world in this rural dominion,</L>
<L>No mortal opposes his will or opinion;</L>
<L>And thus he is spoil'd—Politicians all say,</L>
<L>Human nature's not fashion'd for absolute sway.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis true, tho' the world, as you say, think him odd,</L>
<L>In this sphere he is held a diminutive god:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>And when I behold how his fortune is spent,</L>
<L>In suppressing vexation, and spreading content;</L>
<L>When I hear all the poor his kind bounty expressing,</L>
<L>And thoroughly know how he merits their blessing,</L>
<L>My feelings with theirs in his eulogy join,</L>
<L>And confess, that his nature is truly divine.</L>
</SP>

<L>Thou excellent Girl! if such fondness and zeal</L>
<L>For a warm-hearted, whimsical Uncle you feel,</L>
<L>With what fine sensations your bosom will glow,</L>
<L>What tender attachment your temper will shew,</L>
<L>When your fortunate lord Love and Hymen invest</L>
<L>With higher dominion o'er that gentle breast!</L>
<L>But tell me, dear Cousin—be honest—declare,</L>
<L>Has no young secret swain form'd an interest there?</L>
<L>I suspect—but don't let my suspicion affright you,</L>
<L>Tho' the good Knight's rare virtues amuse and delight you,</L>
<L>From this gloomy old hall you would wish to get free,</L>
<L>Had not Cupid preserv'd you from feeling <HI>ennui</HI>;</L>

<L>When a Gentleman comes from the East, my good girl,</L>
<L>You all think he is loaded with diamonds and pearl;</L>
<L>You fancy his treasure too great to be told,</L>
<L>And suppose he possesses a mountain of gold.</L>
<L>A few daring blades, by a bold kind of stealth,</L>
<L>Have indeed from the Indies brought home so much wealth,</L>
<L>That with all their keen senses they ne'er could employ it:</L>
<L>And have dy'd from the want of a heart to enjoy it:</L>
<L>But some hundred brave lads, whom gay youth led to enter</L>
<L>That promising region of hope and adventure,</L>
<L>Have toil'd many years in those rich-burning climes,</L>
<L>With small share of their wealth, and with none of their crimes.</L>
<L>Now my Master and I both belong to this tribe;</L>
<L>Not a single Nabob have we kill'd for a bribe;</L>

<L>Well, Heaven will pay him, no doubt, in due season.</L>
<L>But what brings him home?—I would fain know the reason</L>
<L>Why he leaves that rich land in the bloom of his life:</L>
<L>I suppose from the want of a cherry-cheek'd wife?</L>
<L>They say those black wenches are sad nasty creatures,</L>
<L>And tho' they've fine shapes they have horrible features.</L>
<L>Does he want a white sweet-heart? or has he a black?</L>
</SP>

<L>'Tis indeed a white woman that brings us both back:</L>
<L>But alas! 'tis an old one—my Master, it seems,</L>
<L>Has a fond simple mother that's troubled with dreams,</L>
<L>And he, like a tender and soft-hearted youth,</L>
<L>Resigns his fine prospect, and comes home forsooth</L>
<L>Because the old dame has express'd her desires</L>
<L>To see him in England before she expires:</L>

<L>Dear excellent Friend, since I owe to your worth</L>
<L>The safety of what I most value on earth,</L>
<L>With those it loves best my heart yields you a place,</L>
<L>And I clasp your kind hand with a sister's embrace.</L>
<L>To judge of the man whom such service endears</L>
<L>I want not the tardy acquaintance of years,</L>
<L>But in strong tho' guick ties, that no chances can sever,</L>
<L>In an instant he seizes my friendship for ever:</L>
<L>And had I much less obligation to you,</L>
<L>My regard and esteem I should still think your due,</L>
<L>From the picture my Felix has drawn of your mind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>His warm soul to his friends is most partially kind:</L>
<L>But such as I am I most truly am yours;</L>
<L>Your goodness my grateful attachment ensures,</L>
<L>And my heart with proud transport your friendship embraces.</L>
<L>Tho' I ne'er gaz'd before on your personal graces,</L>
<L>I've beguil'd some long weeks of hard wearisome duty</L>
<L>With frequent discourse on your virtues and beauty;</L>
<L>And I own for the Colonel it rais'd my esteem,</L>
<L>To mark with what pleasure he dwelt on the theme.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>You're an excellent creature to sooth a fond Wife,</L>
<L>Who regards her Lord's love hardly less than his life;</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="33"/>But since you've replied with good humour so steady</L>
<L>To the ten thousand questions I've ask'd you already,</L>
<L>I'll spare you to-day, and if 'tis in my power</L>
<L>Mention Felix's name only once in an hour.</L>
<L>That my thoughts to the Indies no longer may roam,</L>
<L>Let me talk to you now about matches at home;</L>
<L>Your counsel may make our perplexity less,</L>
<L>And finish our odd tragi-comic distress.</L>
<L>First tell me, and speak without any disguise,</L>
<L>(Tho' I fancy I read all your thoughts in your eyes)</L>
<L>What d'ye think of my Cousin?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her graces indeed</L>
<L>The glowing description of Felix exceed;</L>
<L>Tho' in praising her, oft he with pleasure has smil'd</L>
<L>Like a father describing his favourite child.</L>
<L>For my part, I think she is lavishly blest</L>
<L>With those beauties by which the pure mind is exprest,</L>
<L>That her heart is with truth and with tenderness warm,</L>
<L>That sweet sensibility shines in her form;</L>
<L>A form, on which no man his eye ever turn'd</L>
<L>Without feeling his breast in her welfare concern'd.</L>
<L>'Tis the lot of such graces, wherever they dwell,</L>
<L>None can see their soft mistress and not wish her well.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>Very gallantly said, and the praise is her due—</L>
<L>But how came her Lovers so well known to you?</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her Lovers! —dear Madam, I hope you're in jest—</L>
<L>Or if by their vows your sweet Friend is addrest,</L>
<L>Heaven grant, for the peace of her delicate mind,</L>
<L>That her hand may be never to either resign'd!</L>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>From my soul I assure you I join in your prayer;</L>
<L>But whence does it spring?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will freely declare,</L>
<L>Tho' they're both men of fortune, fair birth, and good name,</L>
<L>With figures that set some young nymphs in a flame;</L>
<L>Tho' at each, many ladies are ready to catch</L>
<L>At what the world calls, a most excellent match;</L>
<L>Yet, if I have read your fair Cousin aright,</L>
<L>A bosom so tender, a spirit so bright,</L>
<L>Must be wretched with such a companion for life,</L>
<L>As each of these Lovers would prove to his Wife.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>You are right; but their characters where could you know?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I knew them at college a few years ago,</L>
<L>Before, by a whimsical odd sort of fate,</L>
<L>And some family losses, too long to relate,</L>
<L>In Europe my views of prosperity ceas'd,</L>
<L>And chance sent me forth to my friends in the East.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray what sort of youths were these two modish men?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>You now find them both what they seem'd to be then;</L>
<L>Two characters form'd like most young men of fashion,</L>
<L>Whose cold selfish pride is their sovereign passion:</L>
<L>In each, tho' they're men of an opposite turn,</L>
<L>The same heart-freezing vanity still you discern,</L>
<L>To indulge that dear vanity, each still displays</L>
<L>All the force of his mind, tho' in different ways.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="35"/>Thence, in spinning weak verse Sapphic's toil never ends,</L>
<L>And Decisive ne'er stops in deriding his friends;</L>
<L>Each equally fancies no nymph can resist</L>
<L>His lips, which he thinks all the Graces have kist.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>Perfect knowledge of both your just picture has shown!—</L>
<L>The warmth of these Lovers diverts me, I own.</L>
<L>Of conquest each seems to himself very clear,</L>
<L>And feels from his rivals no diffident fear.</L>
<L>'Tis easy to see from their satisfied air,</L>
<L>Each loves his own person much more than the Fair.</L>
<L>But my poor gentle Coz wishes both at a distance;</L>
<L>And I want to contrive, by your friendly assistance,</L>
<L>To relieve her, and quietly send them from hence</L>
<L>Without the Knight's knowledge.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>As neither wants sense,</L>
<L>Can't the Lady pronounce their dismission at once,</L>
<L>Which none can mistake but an impudent dunce?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>This measure seems easy indeed at first view;</L>
<L>But alas! 'tis a measure we dare not pursue.</L>
<L>Our warm-hearted, whimsical, positive Knight,</L>
<L>Allows not to woman this natural right;</L>
<L>And hence my young Friend, in a pitiful case,</L>
<L>Knows not how to reject what she ne'er can embrace;</L>
<L>For nothing her Uncle's resentment would smother,</L>
<L>Should she banish one suitor, and not take the other.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then indeed I am griev'd for the Lady's distress;</L>
<L>But how can I aid her?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis hard, I confess,</L>

<L>WELL, my dear, what d'ye think of our medical friend</L>
<L>Whom the letters of Felix so highly commend?</L>
<L>If my gratitude does not my judgment mislead,</L>
<L>He's the man in the world who with you might succeed:</L>

<L>Are you not half in love?—</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, indeed, at first sight!—</L>
<L>His service to you on my heart is engrav'd,</L>

<L>To win me perhaps he might not find it hard,</L>
<L>So esteem'd as he is by the friends I regard;</L>
<L>But I fancy such thoughts will not enter his brain:</L>

<L>So while in the grove I was coolly projecting</L>
<L>New plans for the temple the Knight is erecting,</L>
<L>Our Poet, addicted to amorous sin,</L>

<L>Your hectic appearance I see with concern,</L>
<L>As I know, with your frame if health takes such a turn,</L>
<L>The least indiscretion your life may destroy.</L>
<L>The slightest excess in diversion and joy;</L>
<L>Even those tender cares, which on life's purest plan</L>
<L>Must belong to the state of a Family Man,</L>
<L>May lead to disease from which art cannot save,</L>

<L>Are you serious, dear Doctor?</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>By such a sad end</L>
<L>I lately have lost a poor good-humour'd friend.</L>
<L>You remember Jack Dangle at College, no doubt;</L>
<L>He was just of your age, and a little more stout;</L>
<L>He, with other young sages, left Westminster Hall</L>
<L>To teach English law to the slaves of Bengal.</L>
<L>But Jack, in his new chamber-practice at least,</L>
<L>Too eagerly follow'd the rules of the East.</L>
<L>A bad cough ensu'd, much like yours in its found—</L>
<STAGE>(Decisive <HI>coughs.)</HI></STAGE>
<L>Good God! I could swear 'twas poor Jack under ground,</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="51"/>'Tis his tone so exactly, sepulchral and hollow!</L>
<L>The system he slighted I hope you will follow.</L>
<L>With pains in his breast he was sharply tormented;</L>
<L>But as he at first to my guidance consented,</L>
<L>Some time my strict regimen kept him alive,</L>
<L>Poor Dangle once more was beginning to thrive;</L>
<L>And had he some months in my plan persever'd,</L>
<L>On the earth at this moment he might have appear'd;</L>
<L>But chance threw a pretty white girl in his way,</L>
<L>And eager for marriage, fond Jack would not stay:</L>
<L>In vain I conjur'd him to wait half a year,</L>
<L>And shew'd him the danger he ran very clear.</L>
<L>He thought the remains of his cough but a trifle,</L>
<L>And being unable his passion to stifle,</L>
<L>He took his fair wife;—but, alas! the vile cough</L>
<L>Encreas'd every day till it carried him off!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DECISIVE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I don't recollect any pain in my breast,</L>

<L>From all that may harrass your body or mind,</L>
<L>To a different climate I wish you'd repair,</L>
<L>And for one Winter breathe a less changeable air.</L>
<L>Spend a Christmas at Naples, and when you return</L>
<L>You may marry without any anxious concern.</L>
<L>But you're now at that critical period of life</L>
<L>When, in such frames as yours, nature feels an odd strife,</L>
<L>And, if quiet does not all her functions befriend,</L>
<L>The short earthly scene on a sudden will end.</L>
<L>On a point so important you'll pardon my freedom.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DECISIVE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your cautions oblige me, I feel that I need 'em,</L>
<L>For in truth I am growing as thin as a rabbit,</L>
<L>And there's something consumptive I know in my habit.</L>
<L>My father died soon after taking a Wife,</L>
<L>And cough'd out his soul when I jump'd into life:</L>
<L>I suppose I am going.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Take courage, my Friend;</L>
<L>On your own prudent conduct your life will depend.</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="53"/>If you take but due care for two years, I'll engage</L>
<L>You will stand a fair chance for a healthy old age.</L>
<L>Nor would I advise you this Girl to refuse,</L>

<L>She will wait till your health has recover'd its vigour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DECISIVE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I can part with the Girl without feeling a chasm</L>
<L>In my heart; that will shake with no amorous spasm;</L>
<L>For, to tell you the truth, my old rich Uncle Cob</L>
<L>Is more eager than I for this marrying job.</L>
<L>By this scheme the old Blade is supremely delighted,</L>
<L>Because two large manors may thus be united:</L>
<L>But when of his park I've extended the bound,</L>
<L>It will do me small good if I sink under ground;</L>
<L>And I'm not such a fool in these projects of pelf,</L>
<L>To humour my friends and endanger myself.</L>

<L><PB N="58" REF="57"/>We have in our neighbourhood three young Divines,</L>

<L>Our Bishop's smart Nephew deserves a sweet Wench,</L>
<L>He himself in due time may be rais'd to the Bench;</L>
<L>With him I should like very well to unite her:</L>
<L>And if he hereafter should rise to the Mitre,</L>
<L>Then perhaps we together might bring to perfection</L>
<L>A much-wanted plan for the Church's correction.</L>

<L>More wonderful things I have known brought about;</L>
<L>And tho' my first plan, as you see, has miscarried,</L>
<L>I'm resolv'd that my Niece shall be speedily married.</L>
<L>I'll unite the good Girl to a Priest, if I'm able;</L>
<L>For the young Olive Branch never fails at his table.</L>
<L>There is one I prefer—but to leave the Girl free,</L>
<L>I allow her to make a fair choice of the Three:</L>
<L>I shall therefore invite the whole groupe to the hall,</L>
<L>And I'll now go and make her write cards to them all.

<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>By a project so simple you'd never suspect it:</L>
<L>I have banish'd both Swains, by declaring a Wife</L>
<L>Would rob one of glory, and t'other of life.</L>
<L>I persuaded the Bard his poetical fame</L>
<L>Could never exist with a conjugal flame:</L>
<L>Hence he grew with your charms so licentiously free,</L>

<L>Can you not for the Nymph a fit Husband discover?</L>
<L>You see how she's prest by her Uncle to wed,</L>
<L>Who ne'er quits a scheme he once takes in his head.—</L>

<L>It pleases you thus a poor pilgrim to rally,</L>
<L>Your good nature I know will forgive me if I</L>
<L>To your pleasantry make a too serious reply.</L>
<L>'Tis my maxim to speak, whatsoe'er be the theme,</L>
<L>With a heart undisguis'd to the friends I esteem:</L>
<L>Had I all India's wealth, 'twould be my inclination</L>
<L>To offer it all to your lovely Relation.</L>
<L>But supposing it possible you could be willing</L>
<L>To unite her with one who is scarce worth a shilling;</L>
<L>Believe me, dear Madam, my pride is too great</L>
<L>To wish her to stoop to my humble estate.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such pride, tho' it rests upon no strong foundation,</L>
<L>Is noble, I own, and deserves admiration.</L>
<L>I call it ill-founded, because, in my mind,</L>
<L>If there's fortune enough for a couple when join'd,</L>
<L>If talents and worth are by each duly shar'd,</L>
<L>If in all other points they are equally pair'd,</L>
<L>And mutual regard mutual merit enhances,</L>
<L>It signifies not which supply'd their finances.</L>

<L>Your pardon—how often when fortune's unequal,</L>
<L>Gay weddings produce a most turbulent sequel?</L>

<L>How many things are there such hopes to restrain?</L>
<L>Suppose your dear Colonel, my most noble Friend,</L>
<L>Whom success to your arms may more speedily send!</L>
<L>Suppose, having clos'd the bright work he has plann'd,</L>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>From these words my dear Friend, which I almost adore,</L>

<L>I have caught a quick hope, which is fraught with delight,</L>
<L>That I soon shall be blest with my Felix's sight:</L>
<L>I begin to suspect he's in England already;</L>
<L>I perceive that you can't keep your countenance steady,</L>

<L>How my poor foolish nerves by surprise are affected;</L>
<L>And lest they should fail me beyond all revival,</L>
<L>Has sent you to prepare for his wish'd-for arrival.</L>

<SPEAKER>Sir NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, my Dear, let 'em say so, and I'll say so too,</L>

<L>He who wants to dispose of a tender young maid,</L>
<L>May take a good hint from the gingerbread trade:</L>
<L>If he has any sense, 'twill be ever his plan</L>

<L>How trifling soever your fortune may be,</L>
<L>From the Colonel's esteem, and the virtues I see,</L>
<L>I think you as noble a match for my Niece,</L>
<L>As I could, had you brought home a new golden fleece:</L>
<L>I have money enough, if you're rich in affection.—</L>
<L>As I always have talk'd of an equal connection,</L>
<L>My neighbours, perhaps, may suppose my sight dim,</L>
<L>Or mock my wise choice as a generous whim:</L>
<L>Let them study with zeal, which I hope may succeed,</L>
<L>Of their horses and dogs to improve the best breed;</L>
<L>A study more noble engrosses my mind,</L>
<L>To preserve the first points in the breed of mankind:</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="66"/>On the heart and the soul, as the first points, I dwell,</L>
