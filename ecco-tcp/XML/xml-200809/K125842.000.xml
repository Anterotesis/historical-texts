<L>QUOTH Richard to Bob, "let things go as they will,</L>
<L>"Of pleasure and fun I will still have my fill;</L>
<L>"In a little gay Joy I see nothing amiss,</L>
<L>"And tho' now and then tipsy, <HI>what harm is in this?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For e'en Solomon says, and I vow he says truth,</L>
<L>"'Rejoice, O young man, in the days of thy youth'—</L>
<L>"I am glad" (answer'd Bob) "you're of Solomon's creed,</L>
<L>"But I beg if you quote him you'll please to proceed;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For God" (as the wise man continues to sing)</L>
<L>"Thy soul into Judgment for all this will bring.</L>
<L>"Thus a man may get plung'd in a woeful abyss,</L>
<L>"By chusing to say, <HI>Pray what harm is in this?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Come, Come" (says gay Richard) "don't grudge me a "Cup;</L>
<L>I'm resolv'd, while I'm able, I'll still keep it up;</L>
<L>"Let old Greybeards deny that in frolic's there's bliss;</L>
<L>"I'll game, love, and drink—<HI>and what harm is in this?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Says Robert, "I grant if you live for to-day,</L>
<L>"You may game, love, and drink, and may frolic away;</L>
<L>"But then, my dear Dick, I again must contend,</L>
<L>"That the wise man has bid us <HI>remember the end."</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Says Richard, "when sickness or peevish old age,</L>
<L>"Shall advance to dismiss me from life's merry stage;</L>
<L>"Repentance just then, Boy, may not be amiss,</L>
<L>"But while young I'll be jolly—<HI>what harm is in this?"</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They parted—and Richard his pastimes begun,</L>
<L>'Twas Richard the Jovial, the soul of all fun;</L>
<L>Each dancing bout, drinking bout, Dick would attend,</L>
<L>And he sung and he swore—<HI>nor once thought of the End.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young Molly he courted, the pride of the plain,</L>
<L>He promis'd her marriage, but promis'd in vain;</L>
<L>She trusted his vows, but she soon was undone,</L>
<L>And when she fell weeping he thought it good fun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus scorn'd by her Richard sad Molly run wild,</L>
<L>And roam'd thro' the woods with her destitute child;</L>
<L>'Till poor Molly and Molly's poor Baby were found</L>
<L>One evening in Richard's own mill pond both drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then his conscience grew troubl'd by night and by day,</L>
<L>But it's clamour he drown'd in more drink and more play;</L>
<L>Still Robert exhorted, and like a true friend,</L>
<L>He warn'd him he pray'd him—<HI>to think on the End.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now disturb'd in his dreams poor Molly each night</L>
<L>With her babe stood before him; how sad was the sight!</L>
<L>O how ghastly she look'd as she bade him attend,</L>
<L>And so awfully told him—<HI>"Remember the End."</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She talk'd of the woes and unquenchable fire</L>
<L>Which await the gay Sinner, the Drunkard, and Liar;</L>
<L>How he ruin'd more maidens she bade him beware,</L>
<L>Then she wept, and she groan'd, and she vanish'd in air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now beggar'd by Gaming, distemper'd by Drink,</L>
<L>Death star'd in his face, yet he dar'd not to think;</L>
<L>Despairing of mercy, despising all truth,</L>
<L>He dy'd of old age in the prime of his youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On his Tombstone good Robert these Verses engraved,</L>
<L>Which he hop'd some gay fellow might read and be sav'd.</L>
