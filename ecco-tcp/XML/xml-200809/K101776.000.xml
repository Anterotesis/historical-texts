<P>POEMS UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.</P>
<P>By Mrs. <HI>LEAPOR</HI> of <HI>Brackley</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LONDON,</HI> Printed: And Sold by <HI>J. Roberts</HI> in <HI>Warwick-Lane.</HI> MDCCXLVIII.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Poems was taken from the World at the time when she first began to meet with Encouragement to print them, and, in Compliance with her dying Re∣quest, they are now published for the Benefit of her Father, who is desirous to make use of this Oppor∣tunity of returning his humble Thanks to the Sub∣scribers for the Favour they have been pleased to shew him.</P>
<P>The short Account which has been given of Mrs. <HI>Leapor,</HI> with the Proposals for a Subscription, it is hop'd, will sufficiently apologize for the Defects that shall be found in this Collection. Had she lived to cor∣rect and finish these first Productions of a young unas∣sisted Genius, certainly they would have been greatly improved, tho', as they now appear in their native Simplicity, they cannot surely but afford an agreeable Entertainment to the Reader, and serve as a con∣vincing Proof of the common Aphorism, <HI>Poeta nascitur, non fit.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Leapor</HI> from a Child delighted in reading, and particularly Poetry, but had few Opportunities of procuring any Books of that kind. The Author
<PB REF="3"/>
she most admired was Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> whom she chiefly endeavoured to imitate; how far she succeeded in this, or any other of her Attempts, must be left to the Judgment of the Publick. And indeed if the Poems will not recommend themselves to the Reader, little Advantage is to be expected from any thing that can be said of them here; but, in Justice to the Memory of the Author, as well as for the Satisfaction of all those who have so chearfully and generously contri∣buted to improve the best Legacy she could bequeath to her Father, we beg leave to inform them, that her Conduct and Behaviour entirely corresponded with those virtuous and pious Sentiments which are con∣spicuous in her Poems. She was courteous and oblig∣ing to all, chearful, good-natured, and contented in the Station of Life in which Providence had placed her. The generous and charitable Spirit that appeared in her was exerted upon all Occasions to the utmost of her Ability, and was such as would have been ornamental in a much higher Sphere, to which in all Probability, if it had pleased God to spare her Life, her own Merit would have raised her.</P>
<P>Some of her Papers, a little time before her Death, were communicated to several Persons of Rank and of distinguished Taste and Judgment, who were pleased to express a great Satisfaction in the View they had of promoting a Subscription for their being printed, and by that means encouraging her to pro∣ceed in a Science so agreeable to herself, and enter∣taining to them; but her Friends are now left to la∣ment her Loss, and that so great a Part of a short and valuable Life was spent in Obscurity.</P>

<HEAD>DORINDA at her Glass.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>ORINDA, once the fairest of the Train,</L>
<L>Toast of the Town, and Triumph of the Plain;</L>
<L>Whose shining Eyes a thousand Hearts alarm'd,</L>
<L>Whose Wit inspired, and whose Follies charm'd:</L>
<L>Who, with Invention, rack'd her careful Breast</L>
<L>To find new Graces to insult the rest,</L>
<L>Now sees her Temples take a swarthy Hue,</L>
<L>And the dark Veins resign their beauteous Blue;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="20"/>
While on her Cheeks the fading Roses die,</L>
<L>And the last Sparkles tremble in her Eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bright Sol had drove the sable Clouds away,</L>
<L>And chear'd the Heavens with a Stream of Day,</L>
<L>The woodland Choir their little Throats prepare,</L>
<L>To chant new Carols to the Morning Air:</L>
<L>In Silence wrap'd, and curtain'd from the Day,</L>
<L>On her sad Pillow lost <HI>Dorinda</HI> lay;</L>
<L>To Mirth a Stranger, and the like to Ease,</L>
<L>No Pleasures charm her, nor no Slumbers please.</L>
<L>For if to close her weary Lids she tries,</L>
<L>Detested Wrinkles swim before her Eyes;</L>
<L>At length the Mourner rais'd her aking Head,</L>
<L>And discontented left her hated Bed.</L>
<L>But sighing shun'd the Relicks of her Pride,</L>
<L>And left the Toilet for the Chimney Side:</L>
<L>Her careless Locks upon her Shoulders lay</L>
<L>Uncurl'd, alas! because they half were Gray;</L>
<L>No magick Baths employ her skilful Hand,</L>
<L>But useless Phials on her Table stand:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="21"/>
She slights her Form, no more by Youth inspir'd,</L>
<L>And loaths that Idol which she once admir'd.</L>
<L>At length all trembling, of herself afraid,</L>
<L>To her lov'd Glass repair'd the weeping Maid,</L>
<L>And with a Sigh address'd the alter'd Shade.</L>
<L>Say, what art thou, that wear'st a gloomy Form,</L>
<L>With low'ring Forehead, like a northern Storm;</L>
<L>Cheeks pale and hollow, as the Face of Woe,</L>
<L>And Lips that with no gay Vermilion glow?</L>
<L>Where is that Form which this false Mirror told</L>

<L>No more the Rose nor Hyacinth were seen,</L>

<L>But the rude Thistle rear'd its hoary Crown,</L>
<L>And the ripe Nettle shew'd an irksom Brown.</L>
<L>In mournful Plight the tarnish'd Groves appear,</L>

<L>' Or if a Gloom my trembling Heart invades,</L>
<L>' Ah! may it vanish with the nightly Shades</L>
<L>' Through the craz'd Walls: O may not Reason fly?</L>
<L>' But if it does then let its Mansion die:</L>

<L>Thus far, O <HI>Mira,</HI> thou mayst ask of Heav'n,</L>
<L>How bless'd the Mortal to whom these are giv'n:</L>
<L>If such thy Lot, let Kings enjoy their Crowns,</L>
<L>Their pageant State and arbitrary Frowns:</L>
<L>Who, tho' encircl'd by their shining Slaves,</L>
<L>Intriguing Friends and well dissembl'd Knaves,</L>
<L>Are only wretched Idols plac'd on high,</L>
<L>To bear the Rage of a tempestuous Sky:</L>
<L>And while the Storms around his Temples blow,</L>
<L>His fawning Servants safely sneer below:</L>
<L>But now the Sun brings on the Noon of Day,</L>
<L>Rise, <HI>Mira,</HI> rise and shun the scorching Ray:</L>

Whom not the sacred Diadem cou'd shield,</L>

<HEAD>ESSAY on FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO <HI>Artemisia.</HI>—'Tis to her we sing,</L>
<L>For her once more we touch the sounding String,</L>
<L>'Tis not to <HI>Cythera</HI>'s Reign nor <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Fires,</L>
<L>But sacred Friendship that our Muse inspires.</L>
<L>A Theme that suits <HI>Aemilia</HI>'s pleasing Tongue:</L>
<L>So to the Fair Ones I devote my Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Wise will seldom credit all they hear,</L>
<L>Tho' saucy Wits shou'd tell them with a Sneer,</L>
<L>That Womens Friendships, like a certain Fly,</L>
<L>Are hatch'd i'th Morning and at Ev'ning die.</L>
<L>'Tis true, our Sex has been from early Time</L>
<L>A constant Topick for Satirick Rhyme:</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="93"/>
Nor without Reason—since we're often found,</L>
<L>Or lost in Passion, or in Pleasures drown'd:</L>
<L>And the fierce Winds that bid the Ocean roll,</L>
<L>Are less inconstant than a Woman's Soul:</L>
<L>Yet some there are who keep the mod'rate Way,</L>
<L>Can think an Hour, and be calm a Day:</L>
<L>Who ne'er were known to start into a Flame,</L>
<L>Turn Pale or tremble at a losing Game.</L>
<L>Run <HI>Chloe</HI>'s Shape or <HI>Delia</HI>'s Features down,</L>
<L>Or change Complexion at <HI>Celinda</HI>'s Gown:</L>
<L>But still serene, compassionate and kind,</L>
<L>Walk through Life's Circuit with an equal Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all Companions I would choose to shun</L>
<L>Such, whose blunt Truths are like a bursting Gun,</L>
<L>Who in a Breath count all your Follies o'er,</L>
<L>And close their Lectures with a mirthful Roar:</L>
<L>But Reason here will prove the safest Guide,</L>
<L>Extremes are dang'rous plac'd on either Side.</L>
<L>A Friend too soft will hardly prove sincere;</L>
<L>The Wit's inconstant, and the Learn'd severe.</L>

<PB N="76" REF="94"/>
<L>Good-Breeding, Wit, and Learning, all conspire</L>
<L>To charm Mankind and make the World admire:</L>

<L>The main Ingredient is an honest Heart:</L>
<L>By this can <HI>Urs'la</HI> all our Souls subdue</L>
<L>Which wanting, this, not <HI>Sylvia</HI>'s Charms, can do.</L>

<L>One Line devoted to <HI>Fidelia</HI>'s Praise,</L>
<L>The lov'd Companion of my early Days:</L>
<L>Whouse harmless Thoughts are sprightly as her Eyes,</L>
<L>By Nature chearful, and by Nature wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To have them last, the social Laws decree;</L>
<L>We choose our Friendships in the same degree:</L>
<L>What mighty Pleasure, if we might presume,</L>
<L>To strut with Freedom in <HI>Arvida</HI>'s Room,</L>
<L>Or share the Table what supreme Delight?</L>
<L>With some proud Dutchess or a scornful Knight,</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="95"/>
To sit with formal and assenting Face?</L>
<L>For who shall dare to contradict her Grace?</L>
</LG>

<L>Our free-born Nature hates to be confin'd,</L>
<L>Where State and Power check the speaking Mind;</L>
<L>Where heavy Pomp and sullen Form withholds</L>
<L>That chearful Ease and Sympathy of Souls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But yet the Soul whate'er its Partner do,</L>
<L>Must lift its Head above the baser Crew.</L>
<L>Celestial Friendship with its nicer Rules,</L>
<L>Frequents not Dunghills nor the Clubs of Fools.</L>
<L>It asks, to make this Union soft and long,</L>
<L>A Mind susceptible, and Judgment strong;</L>
<L>And then a Taste: But let that Taste be giv'n</L>
<L>By mighty Nature and the Stamp of Heav'n:</L>
<L>Possest of these, the justly temper'd Flame</L>
<L>Will glow incessant, and be still the same:</L>
<L>Not mov'd by Sorrow, Sickness, or by Age</L>
<L>To sullen Coldness or distemper'd Rage.</L>
<L>The Soul unstain'd with Envy or with Pride,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with itself and all the World beside,</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="96"/>
Unmov'd can see gilt Chariots whirling by,</L>
<L>Or view the wretched with a melting Eye,</L>
<L>Discern a Failing and forgive it too:</L>
<L>Such, <HI>Artemisia,</HI> we may find in you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be seldom sour, or your Friends will fly</L>
<L>From the hung Forehead and the scornful Eye:</L>
<L>Nor, like <HI>Aurelia,</HI> in the Morning kind,</L>
<L>And soft as Summer or the western Wind:</L>
<L>But round ere night her giddy Passions wheel,</L>
<L>She'll clap the Door against your parting Heel.</L>
<L>An even Temper will be sure to please,</L>
<L>With cool Reflexion and a chearful Ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see <HI>Armida</HI>'s unfrequented Rooms,</L>
<L>How vainly spread with Carpets and Perfumes:</L>
<L>All shun her like the Cocatrice's Beams,</L>
<L>And for no other Reason but her loath'd Extremes.</L>
<L>To-day more holy than a cloister'd Nun,</L>
<L>Almost an Atheist by to-morrow's Sun:</L>
<L>Now speaks to Heaven with a lifted Eye:</L>
<L>Now to her Footman, You're a Rogue, and lye.</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="97"/>
O say, from what strange Principles begin</L>
<L>These odd Compounds of Piety and Sin?</L>
<L>A sickly Fair may some Excuses find,</L>
<L>(What grieves the Body will affect the Mind)</L>
<L>But not the Creatures who have learn'd to screen</L>
<L>Their own Ill-nature in the name of Spleen.</L>
<L>What the black Mists afflict the aking Skull,</L>
<L>The Spirits tremble and the Heart be dull:</L>
<L>Have you from thence a Licence to offend,</L>
<L>Affront a Patron or abuse a Friend?</L>
<L>And ape the Manners of a surly Beast,</L>
<L>Because 'tis cloudy and the Wind's i'th' East?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But all have Failings, not the best are free,</L>
<L>Or in a greater or a less Degree.</L>
<L>What follows then?—Forgive, or unforgiven</L>
<L>Expect no Passage at the Gate of Heav'n.</L>
<L>Kind Nature gave, in Pity to Mankind,</L>
<L>This social Virtue to the human Mind:</L>
<L>This gives our Pleasures a more easy Flow,</L>
<L>And helps to blunt the Edge of smarting Woe:</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="98"/>
The Soul's Relief, with Grief or Cares opprest,</L>
<L>Is to disclose them to a faithful Breast;</L>
<L>And then how lovely in a Friend appear,</L>
<L>The mournful Sigh and sympathizing Tear.</L>
<L>When changing Fortune with propitious Ray,</L>
<L>Gilds the brown Ev'ning or the smiling Day;</L>
<L>The pleas'd Companion shares the welcome Tide,</L>
<L>And wrap'd in Joy the happy Minutes glide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Grave Authors differ—Men of Sense incline</L>
<L>This Way or that—Opinions rarely join:</L>
<L>Their Thoughts will vary. Why? Because they're free,</L>
<L>But most in this and only this agree;</L>
<L>That our chief Task is seldom to offend,</L>
<L>And Life's great Blessing a well-chosen Friend.</L>

<HEAD>The FIELDS of MELANCHOLY and CHEARFULNESS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>STILL were the Groves, and venerable Night</L>
<L>O'er half the Globe had cast her gloomy Veil,</L>
<L>When by a Taper's solitary Gleam</L>
<L>Sat musing <HI>Mira</HI> pensive and alone;</L>
<L>In her sad Breast officious Memory</L>
<L>Reviv'd the Pictures of departed Friends,</L>
<L>Whose pleasing Forms she must behold no more.</L>
<L>Forgotten Woe, that for a time had slept,</L>
<L>Rose into Life, and like a Torrent pour'd</L>
<L>On her faint Soul, which sunk beneath its Rage:</L>
<L>At length soft Slumber kindly interven'd,</L>
<L>And clos'd those Eye-lids that were drench'd in Tears;</L>
<L>But restless Fancy that was waking still,</L>
<L>Led my deluded Spirit on the Wing</L>
<L>To pictur'd Regions and imagin'd Worlds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I seem'd transported to a gloomy Land,</L>
<L>Whose Fields had never known the chearful Sun:</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="164"/>
A heavy Mist hung in the frowning Sky,</L>
<L>No feather'd Warblers chear'd the mourning Groves,</L>
<L>Nor blushing Flow'rs adorn'd the barren Ground:</L>
<L>I gaz'd around the solitary Coast,</L>
<L>When lo a Nymph with solemn Air approach'd,</L>
<L>Whose Dress was careless and her Features grave,</L>
<L>Her Voice was broken and her Hearing dull:</L>
<L>She spoke but seldom, yet at last she told</L>
<L>Me in a Whisper, that her Name was Thought;</L>
<L>And more, she offer'd, with a friendly Air,</L>
<L>To lead me safely through the dreary Gloom:</L>
<L>We walk'd along through rough unpleasing Paths,</L>
<L>O'er Beds of Night-Shade and through Groves of Yew,</L>
<L>Till we arriv'd within a dusky Wood,</L>
<L>Whose spacious Bound was fenc'd with shagged Thorn.</L>
<L>The Trees were baleful Cypress; and a few</L>
<L>Tall Pines that murmur'd to the rushing Wind:</L>
<L>Here dwelt the Natives, (mournful as the Place)</L>
<L>Or sunk in real or imagin'd Woe;</L>
<L>Complaining Sounds were heard on ev'ry Side,</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="165"/>
And each bewail'd the loss of something dear:</L>
<L>Some mourn'd a Child that in its Bloom expir'd,</L>
<L>And some a Brother's or a Parent's Fate:</L>
<L>Lost Wealth and Honours many Tongues deplor'd,</L>
<L>And some were wretched, tho' they knew not why.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as we reach'd the Centre of the Place,</L>
<L>Complaints were heard more piercing than before:</L>
<L>The gathering Fogs grew thicker o'er our Heads,</L>
<L>And a cold Horror thrill'd our wounded Souls,</L>
<L>And thus we travell'd, pensive beyond measure,</L>
<L>Through Paths half cover'd with perplexing Thorns;</L>
<L>At length we found two Rows of aged Firs,</L>
<L>Whose Tops were blasted by unwholsom Winds.</L>
<L>This solitary <HI>Vista</HI> op'ning wide,</L>
<L>Disclos'd the Palace of its mournful Queen:</L>
<L>Before the Gate was plac'd a frightful Guard,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who serv'd as Porters to the gloomy Dome:</L>
<L>Here, stretch'd upon a miserable Couch,</L>
<L>Lay pining Sickness with continual Groans;</L>
<L>And by her Side, (array'd in filthy Weeds)</L>
<L>Sat quaking Poverty with ghastly stare:</L>
<L>His Presence seem'd to aggravate her Pain,</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="166"/>
For when she cast her languid Eyes on him,</L>
<L>She hid her Face and rais'd a fearful Cry.</L>
<L>There Disappointment like a Statue stood,</L>
<L>With Eyes dejected and with Visage pale:</L>
<L>Her heaving Bosom seem'd to swell with Anguish,</L>
<L>And in her Hand she grasp'd a broken Reed:</L>
<L>Here, in the Garb of Piety, we saw</L>
<L>Proud Error frowning with a Look severe:</L>
<L>Doubt at his Elbow bore a Rod of Snakes,</L>
<L>And held a Cup fill'd to the Brim with Tears,</L>
<L>By these we pass'd into the dusky Court,</L>
<L>O'er-run with Hemlock and with gloomy Fern:</L>
<L>Perpetual Night hung o'er the dismal Walls,</L>
<L>And from the Ground unhealthy Vapours rose;</L>

<L>By waking Fancies, and by frightful Dreams</L>
<L>This led us to a subterraneous Cell,</L>

<L>The musing Matron sat upon a Throne</L>
<L>Of mould'ring Earth—her Footstool of the same;</L>

And for her Canopy an aged Yew</L>
<L>Spread o'er her Head its venerable Arms:</L>
<L>Her careless Robe was of a sable Hue,</L>
<L>And on her Shoulders flow'd her slighted Hair:</L>
<L>Her Lips were clos'd with an eternal Silence;</L>
<L>Her Arms were folded and her Head reclin'd;</L>
<L>On either Side her pale Attendants stood,</L>
<L>Two mournful Maids, Dejection and Despair;</L>
<L>The first (attended with continual Faintings)</L>
<L>Seem'd on the Point to close her dying Eyes:</L>
<L>A constant Dew hung on her death-like Brow,</L>
<L>And her cold Bosom half forgot to heave.</L>
<L>Despair (whose Garments by herself were torn)</L>
<L>Was mark'd with Wounds that Time can never heal:</L>
<L>With desp'rate Hand she struck her bleeding Breast,</L>
<L>And wash'd the Ground with never-ceasing Tears;</L>

<L>And in the midst the Effigies of Death.</L>

<L>Shock'd at the Place we hasted to return,</L>

<L>Long time we travell'd through untrodden Paths,</L>

At length the floating Clouds began to part,</L>
<L>And left behind them Streaks of chearful Azure;</L>
<L>Our Path grew smooth and widen'd to the view,</L>
<L>Until it open'd on a spacious Field;</L>
<L>A Field whose Charms no Painter e'er cou'd reach,</L>
<L>Though he shou'd borrow from the Poet's Heav'n;</L>
<L>The Clime was temp'rate and the Air was still,</L>
<L>The sprouting Turf was of a beauteous Green,</L>
<L>Speckled with Flow'rs of a delicious Dye.</L>
<L>Here crystal Lakes were border'd round with Trees,</L>
<L>Where Blossoms flourish'd in eternal Spring;</L>
<L>For here the Groves no blasting Tempests know,</L>
<L>But still are blest with Fruits that ne'er decay:</L>
<L>Perpetual Sun-shine crown'd the gaudy Hills,</L>
<L>And the fair Vallies were with Plenty gay.</L>

<L>A Path there was, trod o'er the spicy Field,</L>
<L>Which led the Wand'rer to a blissful Shade,</L>
<L>Whose Fence was made of balmy Eglantine;</L>
<L>Where the fair Plane o'erlook'd the Myrtle Shrub,</L>

<L><HI>Health,</HI> like a Sylvan Huntress cloath'd in Green,</L>

None guard the Flocks, nor hunt the flying Prey,</L>

<L>Then rag'd the God that wears the silver Bow,</L>
<L>And his broad Eyes with sparkling Fury glow,</L>
<L>Descended <HI>Phoebus</HI> in a burning Ray,</L>

<LG>
<L>OF <HI>Florimelia</HI> and her Charms I sing,</L>
<L>Fair as the Blossoms of the smiling Spring;</L>
<L>Whose lovely Temples wore a Myrtle Wreath,</L>
<L>That serv'd to shade her glowing Cheeks beneath:</L>
<L><PB N="184" REF="202"/>
How wou'd that Brow, which never knew to frown,</L>
<L>Become the Splendor of an awful Crown;</L>
<L>For, by the lustre of her shining Eyes,</L>
<L>You'd take her for an Empress in disguise:</L>
<L>Those graceful Limbs tho' clad in humble Green,</L>
<L>Wou'd suit a Princess, nor disgrace a Queen:</L>
<L>Yet a plain Crook adorn'd her snowy <HI>Hands,</HI></L>
<L>Fair as the Fleeces of her tender <HI>Lambs:</HI></L>
<L>Her Task it was, those tender Lambs to lead,</L>
<L>O'er the tall Mountain on the fertile Mead:</L>
<L>Where the clear Fountains gently murmur by,</L>
<L>And sounding Grottos to her Flute reply:</L>
<L>Her Flute and Song delude the tedious Day,</L>
<L>And her soft Hours calmly glide away.</L>
<L>In Smiles the Fair One view'd the rising Sun,</L>
<L>In Smiles beheld him when his Race was done:</L>
<L>And when his Beams had bid the Fields adieu,</L>
<L>And the damp Meadows shone with pearly Dew;</L>
<L>Pent in their Fold she leaves her wanton Care,</L>
<L>And to her home returns the happy Fair:</L>
<L>'Twas a low Cottage, humble as their Fate,</L>
<L>Where an old Father met her at the Gate:</L>
<L><PB N="185" REF="203"/>
This Hind was call'd <HI>Asophus</HI> of the Plain,</L>
<L>A Name much valu'd by each honest Swain:</L>
<L>On whose grave Brow were seen the Marks of Time,</L>
<L>No more his Cheeks confess'd their healthy Prime:</L>
<L>Dim were his Eyes: Those Eye-balls that had seen</L>
<L>Full fourscore Springs array'd in sprightly Green:</L>
<L>Child of his Age was <HI>Florimel</HI> the Fair;</L>
<L>And she alone his Comfort and his Care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their little House was plac'd beneath a Hill,</L>
<L>Whose Verge was water'd by a streaming Rill:</L>
<L>The Stranger here no gilded Spires saw,</L>
<L>For this low Roof was thatch'd with humble Straw;</L>
<L>Mosaick here nor Fret-work there was none,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Venice</HI> Glass to sparkle in the Sun:</L>
<L>Its only Window was of Osier made,</L>
<L>Full South it look'd and seldom knew the Shade,</L>
<L>Where by the Sun this careful Peasant knew,</L>
<L>How o'er his Head the swift-wing'd Minutes flew;</L>
<L>A little Orchard too was planted nigh,</L>
<L>And the cool River roll'd its Waters by:</L>
<L><PB N="186" REF="204"/>
In whose clear Stream the pendent Willows lave,</L>
<L>And the weak Bullrush trembl'd o'er the Wave:</L>
<L>Within the Banks soft Water-cresses spring,</L>
<L>Where the pleas'd Heron prunes her dabbled Wing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus dwelt <HI>Asophus</HI>—happier far than he</L>
<L>Whose Slaves approach him with a bending Knee;</L>
<L>His willing Eye-lids in soft Slumbers close,</L>
<L>No midnight Revels break his lov'd Repose;</L>
<L>No dark Intrigue for open Vengeance calls,</L>
<L>Nor Envy dwelt within his peaceful Walls:</L>
<L>But his calm Days in one smooth Circle run;</L>
<L>He blest the rising and declining Sun,</L>
<L>A Stranger both to Sickness and to Sin:</L>
<L>'Twas Health without and Happiness within,</L>
<L>While by his Side his <HI>Florimelia</HI> sung,</L>
<L>And his fond Soul upon her Musick hung:</L>
<L>Like him no Parent lov'd his darling Care,</L>
<L>No Child like her so duteous and so fair:</L>
<L>Him with crumb'd Milk both Morn and Eve she fed,</L>
<L>And smooth'd the Pillows for his weary Head:</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="205"/>
With her his Moments gently glide away,</L>
<L>Who dress'd in Smiles the Ev'ning and the Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hear this, ye great Ones, whose unwieldy Store</L>
<L>Is still embitter'd with a Wish for more;</L>
<L>Who strive to climb on Fortune's slipp'ry Hill,</L>
<L>And swallow Ruin in a golden Pill.</L>
<L>But learn from hence that Happiness can dwell,</L>
<L>With a plain Peasant in his humble Cell:</L>
<L>She loves the Village and the harmless Hind,</L>
<L>With a clear Conscience and a chearful Mind;</L>
<L>And the gay Wantons vainly search around,</L>
<L>For Bliss which only is with Virtue found.</L>

<L>BENEATH a Mountain's solitary Shade</L>
<L>Liv'd <HI>Catharina,</HI> then an ancient Maid,</L>
<L>An useful Dame that ev'ry Simple knew,</L>
<L>And from choice Herbs exhal'd a cordial Dew.</L>
<L>Rude was her Dome, and hid from prying Eyes,</L>
<L>By lofty Hills that seem'd to reach the Skies;</L>
<L>Deep in a Rock the winding Cavern run,</L>
<L>A bending Cypress skreen'd it from the Sun:</L>
<L>From its rude Side a Fountain us'd to flow,</L>
<L>That pour'd incessant on the Stones below:</L>
<L><PB N="193" REF="211"/>
This Musick lull'd the pensive Dame to Rest,</L>
<L>And drew soft Slumbers on her aching Breast:</L>
<L>No Sun was there, nor scarce a dawning Gleam,</L>
<L>No twinkling Stars, nor <HI>Cynthia</HI>'s silver Beam.</L>
<L>There naked Elms and sapless Oaks appear'd,</L>
<L>With Age grown rotten, and by Light'ning sear'd;</L>
<L>There perch'd the Raven and the gray-ey'd Owl,</L>
<L>With his wise Visage and his serious Scowl;</L>
<L>No Flow'rets there bedeck the mossy Ground,</L>
<L>But a thick Forest spread its Shade around,</L>
<L>Where the smooth Box and browner Hasel grew,</L>
<L>The solemn Pine-tree and the baleful Yew:</L>
<L>Here no glad Sound was heard nor human Tongue,</L>
<L>Not <HI>Colin</HI>'s Flute nor <HI>Blouzelinda</HI>'s Song:</L>

<L>Secluded both from Envy and from Praise.</L>
<L>Not so her laughing Moments us'd to run,</L>

<L>When to her Flock repair'd the gazing Swains,</L>
<L>Her Flock was then the fairest of the Plains:</L>

And she no less—with Veins of sprightly Blue,</L>

<L>The Loves and Graces round her Features flew.</L>
<L>Her Mind was chearful as the rising Day,</L>
<L>Mature as Summer and as <HI>April</HI> gay;</L>
<L>Yet Fate too soon eclips'd her early Joy,</L>
<L>She fell the Victim of the winged Boy,</L>

<L>'Twas <HI>Celadon,</HI> 'twas he that caus'd her Pain,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then wept the Fair with Grief and Rage oppress'd;</L>
<L>Strange Passions labour'd in her pensive Breast;</L>
<L>She lost her Crook—her Flocks no more were told,</L>
<L>And her Lambs wander'd from their nightly Fold,</L>
<L>Till to these Shades she took her desp'rate Way,</L>

<L>Here the gay Roses on her Cheek expir'd,</L>
<L>And from her Eyes the laughing Loves retir'd:</L>
<L>No flow'ry Wreaths her faded Temples knew,</L>
<L>Her Locks uncomb'd upon her Shoulders flew;</L>
<L>No silken Vestments on her Limbs were roll'd,</L>
<L>A russet Mantle sav'd her from the Cold;</L>
<L>A simple Cordage round her Waste she ty'd,</L>
<L>And a rude Staff her better Hand supply'd.</L>

<L>IN vain, alas! (do lazy Mortals cry)</L>
<L>In vain wou'd Wisdom trace the boundless Sky,</L>
<L>Where doubled Wonders upon Wonders rise,</L>
<L>And Worlds on Worlds confound our dazzl'd Eyes:</L>
<L>Better be still—Let Nature rest, say they,</L>
<L>Than err by Guess and with Opinion stray:</L>
<L>Then tell me, why our Eyes were made to view</L>
<L>Those Orbs that glister in the fluid Blue?</L>

Why in our Sight those shining Wonders roll?</L>
<L>Or why to Man was giv'n a thinking Soul?</L>
<L>May I not ask how moves the radiant Sun?</L>
<L>How the bright Stars their pointed Circuits run?</L>
<L>What warms those Worlds that so remotely shine?</L>
<L>And what can temper <HI>Saturn</HI>'s frozen Clime?</L>
<L>Who that beholds the full-orb'd Moon arise,</L>
<L>That chearful Empress of the nightly Skies;</L>
<L>Who wou'd not ask (cou'd learned Sages tell)</L>
<L>What kind of People on her Surface dwell?</L>
<L>But there we pause—Not <HI>Newton</HI>'s Art can show</L>
<L>A Truth, perhaps, not fit for us to know.</L>

<L>How great the Pow'r, who gave those Worlds to roll;</L>
<L>The Thought strikes inward, and confounds the Soul;</L>
<L>Fall down, O Man—Ah fall before the Rod</L>
<L>Of this Almighty, All-creating God:</L>
<L>But hark—from Heav'n there came a chearing Sound;</L>
<L>Now Man revives, and smile the Worlds around:</L>

<L>When from the Stars we turn our aking Eyes,</L>

<L>Who not surpris'd can trace each just Degree</L>
<L>From the swift Eagle to the peevish Bee;</L>
<L>From the fierce Lion that will yield to none,</L>

<L>How near one Species to the next is join'd,</L>

<L>Less huge the Dolphin to the Sun displays</L>

<HEAD>The RIVAL BROTHERS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>CELIA and I, to share the vernal Gales,</L>
<L>One Ev'ning wander'd o'er the dewy Vales;</L>
<L>Still was the Soul, and ev'ry Sense was pleas'd,</L>
<L>And the cool Heart from Care and Business eas'd:</L>
<L>Arm lock'd in Arm with heedless Steps we rove,</L>
<L>Round the fair Borders of a blooming Grove;</L>
<L>Reclin'd at ease within the secret Shades,</L>
<L>A lovely Bower held two fairer Maids,</L>
<L>Soft <HI>Flavia</HI> one, with Cheeks of rosy Dye,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sylvia</HI> famous for her star-like Eye.</L>
<L><HI>Sylvia,</HI> whose Wit was vers'd in charming Wiles,</L>
<L>Who often varied her Discourse with Smiles:</L>
<L>Love-tales she told, some fictious and some true,</L>
<L>The Subject various and her Stories new;</L>
<L>Of Innocence oppress'd by mightier Wrong,</L>
<L>And many Proofs she drew from sacred Song:</L>
<L>When <HI>Flavia</HI> thus—behold the ling'ring Day</L>

<L>The <HI>Rival Brothers,</HI> let my <HI>Sylvia</HI> tell,</L>
<L>How cross they lov'd, and who untimely fell:</L>

<L>Long time before our Fathers Lives began,</L>
<L>There liv'd an ancient and a worthy Man,</L>

<L>For Wretches knew and bless'd <HI>Clytiphon</HI>'s Name,</L>
<L>Just without Pride, without Reluctance kind;</L>
<L>For inborn Goodness with soft Pity join'd,</L>
<L>To form the Basis of his godlike Mind.</L>
<L>His temp'rate Soul was ne'er disturb'd with Rage,</L>
<L>But graceful bore the rev'rend Weight of Age:</L>
<L>All bounteous Heav'n had to his share consign'd:</L>
<L>A moderate Fortune with a peaceful Mind:</L>
<L>His Dwelling seated on a rising Hill,</L>
<L>Was water'd round with many a crystal Rill:</L>
<L><PB N="203" REF="221"/>
Gardens and Groves the smother'd Buildings screen,</L>
<L>Which look'd the Seat of some retir'd Queen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Cythania</HI> tost of the admiring Land,</L>
<L>The fairest Virgin of the shining Band,</L>
<L>Did to <HI>Clytiphon</HI>'s Honour trust her Charms,</L>
<L>And gave her Beauties to his faithful Arms:</L>
<L>But cruel Death, whose Business is to rend</L>
<L>The pale-ey'd Matron from her weeping Friend,</L>
<L>Had torn <HI>Cythania</HI> from his widow'd Side,</L>
<L>And left her Spouse to wail his constant Bride:</L>
<L>Heav'n spar'd one Child to crown his feeble Age,</L>
<L>To chear his Spirits and his Grief asswage:</L>
<L><HI>Sophinia</HI> precious to her Father's Mind,</L>
<L>To her alone was ev'ry Wish confin'd:</L>
<L>Nor did the Virgin less deserve his Care,</L>
<L>Her guiltless Soul was like her Person fair;</L>
<L>For Heav'n to form this matchless Beauty join'd</L>
<L>Her Mother's Features to her Father's Mind;</L>
<L>Not op'ning Roses nor the bashful Day,</L>
<L>Blush'd half so sweetly as <HI>Sophinia</HI> gay:</L>
<L>Her Eyes were dazzling and her Temples fair,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Feature wore a smiling Air;</L>
<L><PB N="204" REF="222"/>
For Wit and Learning she out-strip'd her Kind,</L>
<L>Nor cou'd her Sex debase her noble Mind;</L>
<L>In search of Knowledge she wou'd spend the Day,</L>
<L>And Judgment walk'd before her guiltless Way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not many Furlongs from those blissful Plains,</L>
<L>Where good <HI>Clytiphon</HI> rul'd the happy Swains,</L>
<L>There liv'd a wealthy and a worthy Peer,</L>
<L>Lov'd by his Friends and to his Country dear;</L>
<L><HI>Laon</HI> the great in Valour justly fam'd,</L>
<L>His Sons <HI>Lycander</HI> and <HI>Polyphon</HI> nam'd,</L>
<L>Both noble Youths and by their Friends admir'd,</L>
<L>And Thirst of Glory both their Hearts inspir'd:</L>
<L><HI>Lycander</HI>'s Form was fairer than his Mind;</L>
<L>His Shape was faultless and his Brow sublime,</L>
<L>His jetty Locks in mazy Ringlets run,</L>
<L>And his bright Eyes were like a Morning Sun:</L>
<L>Rays quick and fierce their subtle Light'nings fling,</L>
<L>His Cheeks were fresher than the dawning Spring;</L>
<L>But then as Tempests o'er the Ocean roll,</L>
<L>Continual Passion tore his boiling Soul;</L>
<L>Disdainful, proud, with an imperious Will,</L>
<L>Headlong he rush'd on unsuspected Ill:</L>
<L><PB N="205" REF="223"/>
Reason in vain oppos'd her sacred Shield,</L>
<L>And Virtue's self must to the Whirlwind yield:</L>
<L><HI>Polyphon</HI>'s Soul was of a gentler Kind,</L>
<L>No rugged Storms cou'd shake his easy Mind,</L>
<L>Still calm and pleasant as the Ev'ning Skies:</L>
<L>When not a Breeze through the still Region flies,</L>
<L>No gloomy Frowns a sullen Heart betray,</L>
<L>His Brow was thoughtless and his Air was gay:</L>
<L>These to <HI>Clytiphon</HI>'s did their Sire attend,</L>
<L>The pleasing Mansion of their Father's Friend,</L>
<L>With Lovers Eyes they both <HI>Sophinia</HI> view,</L>
<L>As with her Years her rising Beauty grew,</L>
<L>With airy Hopes they nurs'd the rival Flame,</L>
<L>And sought with Gifts to win the smiling Dame;</L>
<L>But she too cautious to be soon betray'd,</L>
<L>Their Merit balanc'd, and their Tempers weigh'd:</L>
<L><HI>Lycander</HI>'s Fortune pleas'd the lovely Dame,</L>
<L>His Power, Titles and his rising Fame;</L>
<L>And the gay Maid beheld with early Pride,</L>
<L><HI>Laon</HI>'s bright Heir attending at her Side:</L>
<L>That way wou'd oft her Vanity incline,</L>
<L>But then her Reason fear'd his base Design:</L>
<L><PB N="206" REF="224"/>
Still at her Heart the sullen Doubt remains,</L>
<L>And put a Period to the golden Dreams:</L>
<L><HI>Polyphon</HI>'s Image on her Fancy stole</L>
<L>With thousand Beauties in his taintless Soul;</L>
<L>Clear as his Face and sprightly as his Mien;</L>
<L>Soft as his Voice, and like his Brow serene.</L>
<L><HI>Polyphon</HI> now the wavering Nymph admires,</L>
<L>Nor thinks of Castles, Towns, and shining Spires;</L>
<L>Her changing Thoughts prefer an easy Home,</L>
<L>And dwell with Patience on a younger Son.</L>
<L><HI>Lycander</HI> once her Fav'rite was, but now</L>
<L>He meets Resentment and a frozen Brow:</L>
<L>In vain to move the scornful Nymph he tries,</L>
<L>With sprightly Oaths and well dissembl'd Lies:</L>
<L>His Form no more can please <HI>Sophinia</HI>'s Eyes.</L>
<L>Without Concern he met the Fair's Disdain,</L>
<L>Nor cou'd her Frown disturb the haughty Swain:</L>
<L>Conscious of Merit he pursu'd her still,</L>
<L>And only thought her Tongue bely'd her Will:</L>
<L>For Impudence, to Vice a trusty Squire,</L>
<L>Who bears her Arms and fans her purple Fire,</L>
<L><PB N="207" REF="225"/>
Had taught <HI>Lycander,</HI> that Affairs of Love</L>
<L>Are not regarded in the Realms above;</L>
<L>That Oaths are licens'd to address th' Fair,</L>
<L>And Vows to Virgins but the Sport of Air;</L>

<L>The sly <HI>Sophinia</HI> us'd to leave her Maids,</L>

<L>While the proud Youth who found himself despis'd,</L>

<L>Grew wild with Love and desp'rate with Despair,</L>
<L>And vow'd Destruction to the gentle Pair:</L>
<L><PB N="208" REF="226"/>
No quiet Hour his surly Spirit knows,</L>
<L>Nor Rest by Day-light or at Night Repose:</L>
<L>Cold to his Friends, and if they ask his Care,</L>
<L>He only answers with a fullen Glare.</L>

<LG>
<L>One Ev'ning when the sparkling Sun withdrew,</L>
<L>And thirsty Flowers sip'd the grateful Dew;</L>
<L>When this fair Grove had put on all her Charms,</L>
<L>And Zephyrs play'd amidst her curling Arms;</L>
<L><HI>Sophinia</HI> weary of the sultry Day,</L>
<L>To the cool Forest took her lonely Way,</L>
<L>Attentive only to the Linnets Song,</L>
<L>No ill she thought of, and she fear'd no Wrong:</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Glories of the smiling Year,</L>
<L>For guilty Minds are only taught to fear.</L>
<L>The well-known Path her willing Feet pursue</L>
<L>Through the brown Shade, where in the Centre grew</L>
<L>A Row of Laurels crown'd with lasting Green,</L>
<L>And softer Beech and flow'ring Rose between:</L>
<L>Here in a fatal Hour <HI>Sophinia</HI> came;</L>
<L>For proud <HI>Lycander</HI> watch'd the lovely Dame:</L>
<L>Revenge and Love at once his Bosom fire;</L>
<L>His broad Eyes flash with more than mortal Fire:</L>
<L><PB N="209" REF="227"/>
Then to his Friends the raging Hero flew,</L>
<L>His Friends a thoughtless and a wanton Crew,</L>
<L>Whose slothful Hands were backward, as their Will,</L>
<L>In Virtue's Cause, but resolute in Ill:</L>
<L>To these the Youth disclos'd his rash Design,</L>
<L>His glad Companions in th' Adventure join,</L>
<L>That some well practis'd in the Ruffians Trade</L>
<L>Shou'd bear <HI>Sophinia</HI> from the silent Shade:</L>

<L>Till with rude Voice <HI>Miranthus</HI> thus began:</L>

<L>' Within the Confines of the neigh'bring Wood,</L>
<L>' Whose gloomy Arches seem dispos'd to hide</L>
<L>' Offended Subjects from a Tyrant's Pride.</L>
<L>' And often she has lent her hostile Towers,</L>

' You have what my unready Thought design'd,</L>

<L>' Unskill'd in Love and Beauty's softer Charms:</L>
<L>He ceas'd—Applause was seen in ev'ry Eye,</L>
<L>And Peals of Laughter rent the troubl'd Sky;</L>
<L>Two fav'rite Heroes singl'd from the Crew,</L>
<L>With hostile Feet that sacred Path pursue;</L>
<L>Whose winding Maze betray'd the smiling Bower,</L>
<L>That held <HI>Sophinia</HI> in a baneful Hour:</L>
<L>The heedless Virgin on a Bank they found,</L>
<L>Where the faint Primrose spreads her Odours round,</L>
<L>And nodding Poppies seem'd to kiss the Ground.</L>
<L>With frighted Eyes the trembling fair One sees</L>
<L>Their surly Figures through the parting Trees;</L>
<L>But yet she rose collected in her Fear,</L>
<L>'Twas vain to call and no Assistance near:</L>

You Saints that hover round celestial Springs:</L>
<L>O take and wrap me in your sacred Wings,</L>

<L>But now a Slave whom Beauty ne'er cou'd charm,</L>
<L>Drew nigh and seiz'd her by the ivory Arm:</L>
<L>Through untrod Paths they bore the struggling Maid</L>
<L>To those rude Towers where <HI>Lycander</HI> stay'd,</L>
<L>A dismal Dwelling hid by waving Trees;</L>
<L>So thick they scarce admit the healthy Breeze,</L>
<L>On whose black Walls condensing Vapours hung,</L>
<L>Whose lofty Spires hardly knew the Sun:</L>
<L>His Beams ne'er enter'd here, but in the Room</L>
<L>Perpetual Coldness and eternal Gloom:</L>
<L>Here the pleas'd Youth his charming Prey secures,</L>
<L>And round his Pris'ner shut the plated Doors;</L>
<L>Then left the Virgin to herself, nor stay'd</L>

<L>Like some pale Wretch impatient for his Doom,</L>
<L>His fearful Steps approach'd the hallow'd Room:</L>
<L>For rising Conscience now her Task began,</L>
<L>And guilty Blushes through his Features ran:</L>
<L>Unusual Horrors o'er his Passage hung,</L>
<L>At ev'ry Step the sounding Portals rung:</L>
<L>Before the Door he took a silent Stand,</L>
<L>And the pale Taper trembl'd in his Hand:</L>
<L>A hollow Voice <HI>Lycander</HI> seem'd to call,</L>
<L>And Shadows danc'd along the gloomy Wall:</L>
<L>His haughty Spirit was at this dismay'd,</L>
<L><HI>Lycander</HI> trembl'd, and was once afraid:</L>
<L>Why beats my Heart, my coward Heart, he cries;</L>
<L>And why this Mist before my dazzl'd Eyes?</L>
<L><HI>Sophinia</HI>'s mine, and I will seize my Store,</L>
<L>If thousand Spectres guard the awful Door:</L>
<L>Then rushing in, the lovely Dame he found</L>
<L>In fullen Posture and in Thought profound;</L>
<L>The wonted Roses from her Cheeks were fled,</L>
<L>On her fair Hand reclin'd her beauteous Head:</L>

With Flatt'ry first he tip'd his artful Tongue,</L>

<L>Let not <HI>Sophinia,</HI> with a Smile he cries,</L>
<L>Think we have seiz'd her as a hostile Prize;</L>
<L>The Fault we owe to this unconquer'd Flame,</L>

<L>For thee the East shall yield her spicy Bowers,</L>
<L>And sweeter Baths distil from weeping Flowers;</L>
<L>Then smile my fair One and be timely wise;</L>
<L>The Maid reply'd, and roll'd her scornful Eyes.</L>
<L>Hence, fawning Traitor, why wouldst thou be told,</L>
<L>How much I hate thy Person and thy Gold?</L>

Alone and pensive as I wander'd here,</L>

<L>I know your Brother loves the beauteous Maid;</L>

<L>Their Friends a little, but a martial Train:</L>

Twice twenty Youths their Gen'ral's Voice attend,</L>

<L>Who spite of Reason and their Country's Laws,</L>

<L>Despairing, raging, on the Youth he flew,</L>
<L>While down his Forehead roll'd the sultry Dew:</L>

Blows answer Blows, and round their Temples sing</L>
<L>The glancing Weapons, and the Bucklers ring:</L>
<L>Aloof they fight, or now in Circles wheel'd,</L>
<L>Each thought to conquer; both disdain to yield,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Polyarchus</HI> with a side-way Blow</L>
<L>Transpierc'd the Liver of his heedless Foe:</L>
<L>He drew the Weapon from his tortur'd Side,</L>
<L>The gaping Wound disgorg'd a purple Tide:</L>

<L>Headlong he fell and sob'd away his Soul:</L>
<L>Now Joy transported the victorious Throng,</L>

His tender Arm the deadly Spear arrests,</L>

<L>Loud Shrieks and Clamours rend the frighted Sky:</L>
<L><HI>Polyphon</HI> now with deadly Anguish stung,</L>
<L>His ready Jav'lin at the Victor flung:</L>
<L>The erring Weapon with a whistling Sound</L>
<L>Flew o'er his Head, and plough'd the distant Ground:</L>
<L>Enrag'd to see the bloodless Point descend,</L>

<L>His shining Eyes that did with Fury glow,</L>

Hope not for Conquest, mighty Clown, he cries,</L>

<L><HI>Lycander</HI> saw, but turn'd his Eyes away,</L>
<L>Where in the Dust the mighty Soldier lay;</L>
<L>Then like a Whirlwind rush'd the Youth along,</L>
<L>And sought his Brother in the hostile Throng:</L>

Suspence and Horror held the martial Crew,</L>

<L><HI>Polyphon</HI> cry'd, O stay thy hostile Arm,</L>
<L>The Name of Brother wears a potent Charm:</L>

<L>The mourning Victor bending o'er the slain,</L>

<HEAD>PROSERPINE'S RAGOUT.</HEAD>

<L>But from the Lakes a sulph'rous Mist invades,</L>
<L>And strikes the fainting Empress of the Shades.</L>
<L>The trembling Queen is seiz'd with sickly Yawns,</L>
<L>With griping Colicks and with feverish Qualms.</L>
<L>Back to the Palace was the general Cry,</L>
<L>Before the Lash her sable Coursers fly:</L>
<L>There rests the Dame, and sought her Royal Bed,</L>
<L>Where the soft Pillows rais'd her drooping Head:</L>

<L>Here first he seiz'd as nonsubstantial Foods,</L>
<L>The Courtiers Friendship and the Zeal of Prudes;</L>
<L>The Sighs of Widowers, and blends with those</L>
<L>The Vows of Lovers and the Brains of Beaux;</L>
<L>The Miser's Charity, the Drunkard's Cares;</L>
<L>The Wealth of Poets, and the Tears of Heirs;</L>
<L><HI>Philander</HI>'s Patience, when his Lord denies</L>

<L>From thence Debates and long Harangues to cull,</L>

<HEAD>MIRA to OCTAVIA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAIR One, to you this Monitor I send;</L>
<L><HI>Octavia,</HI> pardon your officious Friend:</L>
<L>You think your Conduct merits only Praise,</L>
<L>But out-law'd Poets censure whom they please:</L>
<L>Thus we begin—your Servant has been told,</L>
<L>That you, (despising Settlements and Gold)</L>
<L>Determine <HI>Florio</HI> witty, young and gay,</L>
<L>To have and hold for ever and for ay;</L>
<L>And view that Person as your mortal Foe,</L>
<L>Who dares object against your charming Beau;</L>
<L>But now to furnish Metre for my Song,</L>
<L>Let us suppose <HI>Octavia</HI> may be wrong:</L>
<L>'Tis true, you're lovely; yet the learn'd aver,</L>
<L>That even Beauties like the rest may err.</L>
<L><PB N="259" REF="277"/>
I know, to shun, you hold it as a Rule,</L>
<L>The arrant Coxcomb and the stupid Fool:</L>
<L>No such is <HI>Florio,</HI> he has Wit—'tis true,</L>
<L>Enough, <HI>Octavia,</HI> to impose on you:</L>
<L>Yet such a Wit you'll, by Experience, find</L>
<L>Worse than a Fool that's complaisant and kind:</L>
<L>It only serves to gild his Vices o'er,</L>
<L>And teach his Malice how to wound the more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I need not tell you, most ingenious Fair,</L>
<L>That hungry Mortals are not fed with Air,</L>
<L>But solid Food: And this voracious Clay</L>
<L>Asks Drink and Victuals more than once a Day:</L>
<L>Now cou'd your <HI>Florio</HI> by his Wit inspire</L>
<L>The chilly Hearth, to blaze with lasting Fire:</L>
<L>Or when his Children round the Table throng,</L>
<L>By an Allusion or a sprightly Song,</L>
<L>Adorn the Board, i'th' twinkling of an Eye,</L>
<L>With a hot Pasty or a Warden Pye,</L>
<L>There might be Reason on <HI>Octavia</HI>'s Side,</L>
<L>And not a Sage cou'd blame the prudent Bride.</L>

<L>Yet (or some Authors often deal in Lies)</L>
<L>Lovers may live on Nuts and Blackberries;</L>

<L>Who in black Forests half a Season stray;</L>
<L>Unless they find Provision on the Trees,</L>
<L>Must sup on Grass and breakfast on the Breeze.</L>
<L>But as you've long been us'd to nicer Fare,</L>
<L>Your Constitution wou'd but hardly bear</L>
<L>Such Food as this: And therefore I advise</L>
<L>That you'd consider (for you're mighty wise)</L>
<L>If sober <HI>Dusterandus</HI> wou'd not make</L>
<L>A better Husband than your darling Rake,</L>
<L>Grave <HI>Dusterandus:</HI> He whose stedfast Mind</L>
<L>Is yet untainted, tho' not much refin'd;</L>
<L>Whose Soul ne'er roves beyond his native Fields;</L>
<L>Nor asks for Joys but what his Pasture yields;</L>
<L>On Life's dull Cares with Patience can attend,</L>
<L>A gentle Master and a constant Friend;</L>
<L>Who in soft Quiet spends the guiltless Days,</L>
<L>His Servants blessing and his Neighbours praise:</L>
<L>Say, would you, in his happy Mansion, reign,</L>
<L>Toast of the Village and the rural Plain?</L>
<L><PB N="261" REF="279"/>
With honest Friends your chearful Days beguile,</L>
<L>While Peace and Plenty on your Table smile:</L>
<L>Or cold and hungry writhe your tired Jaws,</L>
<L>And dine with <HI>Florio</HI> upon Hips and Haws,</L>
<L>In troth I think there's little room to pause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In spite of all romantick Poets sing;</L>
<L>This Gold, my Dearest, is an useful thing:</L>
<L>Not that I'd have you hoard the precious Store,</L>
<L>For not a Wretch is like the Miser poor:</L>
<L>Enjoy your Fortune with a chearful Mind,</L>
<L>And let the Blessing spread amongst the Kind:</L>
<L>But if there's none but <HI>Florio</HI> that will do,</L>
<L>Write Ballads both, and you may thrive—Adieu.</L>
