<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The fourth Battel continued, in which <HI>Neptune</HI> assists the <HI>Greeks:</HI> The Acts of <HI>Idomeneus.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>NEptune,</HI> concern'd for the Loss of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> upon seeing the Fortification forc'd by <HI>Hector,</HI> (who had enter'd the Gate near the Station of the <HI>Ajaxes)</HI> as∣sumes the Shape of <HI>Calchas,</HI> and inspires those Heroes to oppose him: Then in the Form of one of the Generals, encourages the other <HI>Greeks</HI> who had retir'd to their Vessels. The <HI>Ajaxes</HI> form their Troops in a close Phalanx, and put a stop to <HI>Hector</HI> and the <HI>Trojans.</HI> Several Deeds of Valour are perform'd; <HI>Me∣riones</HI> losing his Spear in the Encounter, repairs to seek ano∣ther at the Tent of <HI>Idomeneus.</HI> This occasions a Conversation between those two Warriors, who return together to the Battel. <HI>Idomeneus</HI> signalizes his Courage above the rest; he kills <HI>Othryoneus, Asius,</HI> and <HI>Alcathous. Deiphobus</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> march against him, and at length <HI>Idomeneus</HI> retires. <HI>Mene∣laus</HI> wounds <HI>Helenus,</HI> and kills <HI>Pisander.</HI> The <HI>Trojans</HI> are re∣puls'd in the Left Wing; <HI>Hector</HI> still keeps his Ground against the <HI>Ajaxes,</HI> till being gaul'd by the <HI>Locrian</HI> Slingers and Archers, <HI>Polydamas</HI> advises to call a Council of War: <HI>Hector</HI> approves his Advice, but goes first to rally the <HI>Trojans;</HI> up∣braids <HI>Paris,</HI> rejoins <HI>Polydamas,</HI> meets <HI>Ajax</HI> again, and re∣news the Attack.</P>
<P>The eight and twentieth Day still continues. The Scene is etween the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wall and the Sea-shore.</P>

<L>WHEN now the Thund'rer, on the Sea∣beat Coast,</L>
<L>Had fix'd great <HI>Hector</HI> and his conqu'ring Host;</L>
<L>He left them to the Fates, in bloody Fray,</L>
<L>To toil and struggle thro' the well-fought Day.</L>
<L N="5">Then turn'd to <HI>Thracia</HI> from the Field of Fight</L>
<L>Those Eyes, that shed insufferable Light,</L>
<L>To where the <HI>Mysians</HI> prove their martial Force,</L>
<L>And hardy <HI>Thracians</HI> tame the savage Horse;</L>
<L>And where the far-fam'd <HI>Hippemolgian</HI> strays,</L>
<L N="10">Renown'd for Justice and for length of Days,</L>

<HI>Jove</HI> sees delighted, and avoids the Scene</L>

<L>While his high Law suspends the Pow'rs of Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meantime the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Nep∣tune.</NOTE>Monarch of the watry Main</L>
<L>Observ'd the Thund'rer, nor observ'd in vain.</L>
<L>In <HI>Samothracia,</HI> on a Mountain's Brow,</L>
<L N="20">Whose waving Woods o'erhung the Deeps below,</L>
<L>He sate; and round him cast his azure Eyes,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Ida</HI>'s misty Tops confus'dly rise;</L>
<L>Below, fair <HI>Ilion</HI>'s glitt'ring Spires were seen,</L>
<L>The crowded Ships, and sable Seas between.</L>
<L N="25">There, from the crystal Chambers of the Main</L>
<L>Emerg'd, he sate; and mourn'd his <HI>Argives</HI> slain.</L>
<L>At <HI>Jove</HI> incens'd, with Grief and Fury stung,</L>
<L>Prone down the rocky Steep, he rush'd along;</L>
<L>Fierce as he past, the lofty Mountains nod,</L>
<L N="30">The Forests shake! Earth trembled as he trod,</L>
<L>And felt the Footsteps of th' immortal God.</L>
<L>From Realm to Realm three ample Strides he took,</L>
<L>And, at the fourth, the distant <HI>Aegae</HI> shook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<L>Far in the Bay his shining Palace stands,</L>
<L N="35">Eternal Frame! not rais'd by mortal Hands:</L>
<L>This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd Steeds he reins,</L>
<L>Fleet as the Winds, and deck'd with golden Manes.</L>
<L>Refulgent Arms his mighty Limbs infold,</L>
<L>Immortal Arms, of Adamant and Gold.</L>
<L N="40">He mounts the Car, the golden Scourge applies;</L>
<L>He sits superior, and the Chariot flies.</L>
<L>His whirling Wheels the glassy Surface sweep;</L>
<L>Th' enormous Monsters, rolling o'er the Deep,</L>
<L>Gambol around him, on the watry way;</L>
<L N="45">And heavy Whales in aukward Measures play:</L>
<L>The Sea subsiding spreads a level Plain,</L>
<L>Exults, and owns the Monarch of the Main;</L>
<L>The parting Waves before his Coursers fly;</L>
<L>The wond'ring Waters leave his Axle dry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="50">Deep in the liquid Regions lies a Cave,</L>
<L>Between where <HI>Tenedos</HI> the Surges lave,</L>
<L>And rocky <HI>Imbrus</HI> breaks the rolling Wave:</L>
<L>There the great Ruler of the azure Round</L>
<L>Stop'd his swift Chariot, and his Steeds unbound,</L>
<L N="55"><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
 Fed with ambrosial Herbage from his Hand,</L>
<L>And link'd their Fetlocks with a golden Band,</L>
<L>Infrangible, immortal: There they stay:</L>
<L>The Father of the Floods pursues his way;</L>
<L>Where, like a Tempest, dark'ning Heav'n around,</L>

<L>Th' impatient <HI>Trojans,</HI> in a gloomy Throng,</L>
<L>Embattel'd roll'd, as <HI>Hector</HI> rush'd along.</L>
<L>To the loud Tumult, and the barb'rous Cry,</L>
<L>The Heav'ns re-echo, and the Shores reply;</L>
<L N="65">They vow Destruction to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Name,</L>
<L>And, in their Hopes, the Fleets already flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <HI>Neptune,</HI> rising from the Seas profound,</L>
<L>The God whose Earthquakes rock the solid Ground,</L>
<L>Now wears a mortal Form; like <HI>Calchas</HI> seen,</L>
<L N="70">Such his loud Voice, and such his manly Mien;</L>
<L>His Shouts incessant ev'ry <HI>Greek</HI> inspire,</L>
<L>But most th' <HI>Ajaces,</HI> adding Fire to Fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis yours, O Warriors, all our Hopes to raise;</L>
<L>Oh recollect your ancient Worth and Praise!</L>
<L N="75">'Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;</L>
<L>Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
On other Works tho' <HI>Troy</HI> with Fury fall,</L>
<L>And pour her Armies o'er our batter'd Wall;</L>
<L>There, <HI>Greece</HI> has strength: but this, this Part o'erthrown,</L>
<L N="80">Her Strength were vain; I dread for you alone.</L>
<L>Here <HI>Hector</HI> rages like the Force of Fire,</L>
<L>Vaunts of his Gods, and calls high <HI>Jove</HI> his Sire.</L>
<L>If yet some heav'nly Pow'r your Breast excite,</L>
<L>Breathe in your Hearts, and string your Arms to Fight,</L>
<L N="85"><HI>Greece</HI> yet may live, her threatned Fleet maintain,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then with his Sceptre that the Deep controuls,</L>
<L>He touch'd the Chiefs, and steel'd their manly Souls;</L>
<L>Strength, not their own, the Touch divine imparts,</L>
<L N="90">Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.</L>
<L>Then, as a Falcon from the rocky Height,</L>
<L>Her Quarry seen, impetuous at the Sight,</L>
<L>Forth-springing instant, darts her self from high,</L>
<L>Shoots on the Wing, and skims along the Sky:</L>

<L>The wide Horizon shut him from their View.</L>

<L>Some God, my Friend, some God in human form</L>

<L>Short as he turn'd, I saw the Pow'r appear:</L>

<L>His own bright evidence reveals a God.</L>
<L N="105">Ev'n now some Energy divine I share,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>With equal Ardour (<HI>Telamon</HI> returns)</L>
<L>My Soul is kindled, and my Bosom burns;</L>
<L>New rising Spirits all the Man alarm,</L>

<L>This ready Arm, unthinking, shakes the Dart;</L>
<L>The Blood pours back, and fortifies my Heart:</L>

<L N="115">Full of the God that urg'd their burning Breast</L>

Trembling before th' impending Storm they lie,</L>

<L>Oh lasting Infamy, oh dire Disgrace</L>
<L>To Chiefs of vig'rous Youth, and manly Race!</L>
<L>I trusted in the Gods and you, to see</L>

<P>VERSE 5. ONE might fancy at the first reading of this Passage, that <HI>Homer</HI> here turn'd aside from the main View of his Poem in a vain Ostentation of Learning, to amuse himself with a foreign and unnecessary De∣scription of the Manners and Customs of these Nations. But we shall find, upon better Consideration, that <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s turning aside his Eyes was necessary to the Conduct of the Work, as it gives Opportunity to <HI>Neptune</HI> to assist the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and thereby causes all the Adventures of this Book. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> is too refining on this occasion; when she would have it, that <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s <HI>averting his Eyes</HI> signifies his abandon∣ing the <HI>Trojans;</HI> in the same manner, as the Scripture repre∣sents the Almighty <HI>turning his Face</HI> from those whom he de∣serts. But at this rate <HI>Jupiter</HI> turning his Eyes from the Battel, must desert both the <HI>Trojans</HI> and the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and it is evident from the Context, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> intended nothing less than to let the <HI>Trojans</HI> suffer.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 191. <HI>As from some Mountain's craggy Forehead torn,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> This is one of the noblest Simile's in all <HI>Homer,</HI> and the most justly corresponding in its Circumstances to the thing described. The furious Descent of <HI>Hector</HI> from the Wall represented by a Stone that flies from the top of a Rock, the Hero push'd on by the superior Force of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> as the Stone driven by a Torrent, the Ruins of the Wall falling af∣ter him, all things yielding before him, the Clamour and Tumult around him, all imag'd in the violent bounding and leaping of the Stone, the crackling of the Woods, the Shock, the Noise, the Rapidity, the Irresistibility, and the Augmentation of Force in its Progress. All these Points of Likeness make but the first Part of this admirable Simile. Then the sudden Stop of the Stone when it comes to the Plain, as of <HI>Hector</HI> at the Phalanx of the <HI>Ajaces</HI> (alluding also to the natural Situation of the Ground, <HI>Hector</HI> rushing down the Declivity of the Shore, and being stopp'd on the Level of the Sea.)

The Simile is copied by <HI>Virgil, Aen.</HI> 12.<Q><L>Ac veluti montis saxum de vertice praeceps,</L>

It is but Justice to <HI>Homer</HI> to take notice how infinitely infe∣rior both these Similes are to their Original.

Idomen <HI>of</HI> Crete.]</Q><HI>Idomeneus</HI> appears at large in this Book, whose Character (if I take it right) is such as we see pretty often in common Life: A Person of the first Rank, sufficient enough of his high Birth, growing into Years, con∣scious of his Decline in Strength and active Qualities; and therefore endeavouring to make it up to himself in Dignity, and to preserve the Veneration of others. The true Picture of a stiff old Soldier, not willing to lose any of the Reputation
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
he has acquir'd; yet not inconsiderate in Danger; but by the Sense of his Age, and by his Experience in Battel, become too cautious to engage with any great odds against him: Ve∣ry careful and tender of his Soldiers, whom he had com∣manded so long that they were become old Acquaintance; (so that it was with great Judgment <HI>Homer</HI> chose to intro∣duce him here, in performing a kind Office to one of 'em who was wounded.) Talkative upon Subjects of War, as afraid that others might lose the Memory of what he had done in better Days, of which the long Conversation with <HI>Meriones,</HI> and <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Reproach to him in Iliad 23. ℣. 478. are suffici∣ent Proofs. One may observe some Strokes of Lordliness and State in his Character: That Respect <HI>Agamemnon</HI> seems careful to treat him with, and the particular Distinctions shewn him at Table, are mention'd in a manner that insinu∣ates they were Points upon which this Prince not a little in∣sisted. <HI>Il.</HI> 4. ℣. 257, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The vaunting of his Family in this Book, together with his Sarcasms and contemptuous Railleries on his dead Enemies, savour of the same Turn of Mind. And it seems there was among the Ancients a Tradi∣tion of <HI>Idomeneus</HI> which strengthens this Conjecture of his Pride: For we find in the <HI>Heroicks</HI> of <HI>Philostratus,</HI> that be∣fore he would come to the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, he demanded a Share in the sovereign Command with <HI>Agamemnon</HI> himself.</P>
<P>I must, upon this occasion, make an Observation once for all, which will be applicable to many Passages in <HI>Homer,</HI> and afford a Solution of many Difficulties. It is that our Author drew several of his Characters with an Eye to the Histories then known of famous Persons, or the Traditions that past in those Times. One cannot believe otherwise of a Poet, who appears so nicely exact in observing all the Customs of the Age he described; nor can we imagine the infinite Num∣ber of minute Circumstances relating to particular Persons, which we meet with every where in his Poem, could possibly have been invented purely as Ornaments to it. This Refle∣ction will account for a hundred seeming Oddnesses not only in the <HI>Characters,</HI> but in the <HI>Speeches</HI> of the Iliad: For as no Author is more true than <HI>Homer</HI> to the Character of the Person he introduces speaking, so no one more often suits his
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
Oratory to the Character of the Person spoken to. Many of these Beauties must needs be lost to us, yet this Supposition will give a new Light to several Particulars. For instance, the Speech I have been mentioning of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to <HI>Ido∣meneus</HI> in the 4<HI>th</HI> Book, wherein he puts this Hero in mind of the magnificent Entertainments he had given him, be∣comes in this View much less odd and surprizing. Or who can tell but it had some Allusion to the Manners of the <HI>Cre∣tans</HI> whom he commanded, whose Character was so well known, as to become a Proverb: <HI>The</HI> Cretans, <HI>evil Beasts, and slow Bellies.</HI></P>

However, if we look closely into the Oc∣casion and Drift of this Discourse, the Accusation will I be∣lieve, appear not so well grounded. Two Persons of Distin∣ction, just when the Enemy is put to a stop by the <HI>Ajaces,</HI> meet behind the Army: Having each on important occasions retired out of the Fight, the one to help a wounded Soldier, the other to seek a new Weapon. <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> who is superior in Years as well as Authority, returning to the Battel, is sur∣prized to meet <HI>Meriones</HI> out of it, who was one of his own Officers, (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as <HI>Homer</HI> here calls him) and being jea∣lous of his Soldier's Honour, demands the Cause of his quit∣ting the Fight? <HI>Meriones</HI> having told him it was the want
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
of a Spear, he yet seems unsatisfy'd with the Excuse; adding, that he himself did not approve of that distant manner of fighting with a Spear: <HI>Meriones</HI> being touch'd to the quick with this Reproach, replies, that He of all the <HI>Greeks</HI> had the least reason to suspect his Courage: Whereupon <HI>Idome∣neus</HI> perceiving him highly piqued, assures him he entertains no such hard Thoughts of him, since he had often known his Courage prov'd on such Occasions, where the Danger be∣ing greater, and the Number smaller, it was impossible for a Coward to conceal his natural Infirmity: But now recolle∣cting that a malicious Mind might give a sinister Interpreta∣tion to their Inactivity during this Discourse, he immedi∣ately breaks it off upon that Reflection. As therefore this Conversation has its Rise from a Jealousy in the most ten∣der Point of Honour, I think the Poet cannot justly be blamed for suffering a Discourse so full of warm Sentiments to run on for about forty Verses; which after all cannot be suppos'd to take up more than two or three Minutes from Action.</P>

This gives me an occasion to animadvert upon a false Remark of <HI>Eustathius,</HI> which is inserted in the 30<HI>th</HI> Note on the 11<HI>th</HI> Book, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>Homer,</HI> to shew us nothing is so unseasonable in a Battel as to stay to despoil the slain, feigns that most of the Warriors who do it, are kill'd, wounded, or unsuc∣cessful."</Q> I am astonish'd how so great a Mistake should fall from any Man who had read <HI>Homer,</HI> much more from one who had read him so thoroughly, and even superstiti∣ously, as the old Archbishop of <HI>Thessalonica.</HI> There is scarce a Book in <HI>Homer</HI> that does not abound with Instances to the contrary, where the Conquerors strip their Ene∣mies, and bear off their Spoils in Triumph. It was (as I have already said in the Essay on <HI>Homer</HI>'s Battels) as honou∣rable an Exploit in those Days to carry off the Arms, as it is now to gain a Standard. But it is a strange Consequence, that because our Author sometimes represents a Man unsuc∣cessful in a glorious Attempt, he therefore discommends the Attempt itself; and is as good an Argument against encoun∣tring an Enemy living, as against spoiling him dead. One ought not to confound this with Plundering, between which <HI>Homer</HI> has so well mark'd the Distinction; when he con∣stantly speaks of the Spoils as glorious, but makes <HI>Nestor</HI> in the 6<HI>th</HI> Book, and <HI>Hector</HI> in the 15<HI>th</HI> directly forbid the Pil∣lage, as a Practice that has often prov'd fatal in the midst of a Victory, and sometimes even after it.</P>

<P>VERSE 451.] It will be necessary, for the better under∣standing the Conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> in every Battel he describes, to reflect on the particular kind of Fight, and the Circum∣stances that distinguish each. In this View therefore we ought to remember thro' this whole Book, that the Battel describ'd in it, is a fix'd close Fight, wherein the Armies engage in a gross compact Body, without any of those Skirmishes or Feats of Activity so often mention'd in the foregoing Engagements. We see at the beginning of it the <HI>Grecians</HI> form a Phalanx, ℣. 126. which continues unbroken at the very end, ℣. 806. The chief Weapon made use of is a Spear, being most proper for this manner of Combat; nor do we see any other use of a Chariot, but to carry off the dead or wounded (as in the In∣stance of <HI>Harpalion</HI> and <HI>Deiphobus.</HI>)</P>
<P>From hence we may observe, with what Judgment and Propriety <HI>Homer</HI> introduces <HI>Idomeneus</HI> as the chief in Action on this occasion: For this Hero being declined from his Prime, and somewhat stiff with Years, was only fit for this kind of Engagement, as <HI>Homer</HI> expressly says in the 512th Verse of the present Book.<Q><PB N="74" REF="73"/>

<L><HI>And thus (he cries)—</HI>]</L></Q> It seems (says <HI>Eustathius</HI> on this Place) that the Iliad being an heroick Poem, is of too serious a Nature to admit of Rail∣lery: Yet <HI>Homer</HI> has found the secret of joining two things that are in a manner incompatible. For this Piece of Rail∣lery is so far from raising Laughter, that it becomes a Hero, and is capable to enflame the Courage of all who hear it.

<P>I confess I am of an Opinion very different from this of <HI>Eustathius,</HI> which is also adopted by M. <HI>Dacier.</HI> So severe and bloody an Irony to a dying Person is a fault in Morals, if not in Poetry itself. It should not have place at all, or if it should, is ill placed here. <HI>Idomeneus</HI> is represented a brave Man, nay a Man of a compassionate Nature, in the Circum∣stance he was introduc'd in, of assisting a wounded Soldier. What Provocation could such an one have, to insult so bar∣barously an unfortunate Prince, being neither his Rival nor particular Enemy? True Courage is inseparable from Huma∣nity, and all generous Warriors regret the very Victories they gain, when they reflect what a Price of Blood they cost. I know it may be answer'd, that these were not the Manners of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Time, a Spirit of Violence and Devastation then reigned, even among the chosen People of God, as may be seen from the Actions of <HI>Joshua, &amp;c.</HI> However, if one would forgive the <HI>Cruelty,</HI> one cannot forgive the <HI>Gaiety</HI> on such an occasion. These inhuman Jests the Poet was so far from being oblig'd to make, that he was on the contrary forced to break through the general serious Air of his Poem
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
to introduce them. Would it not raise a Suspicion, that (whatever we see of his superior Genius in other respects) his own Views of Morality were not elevated above the Barbarity of his Age? I think indeed the thing by far the most shock∣ing in this Author, is that Spirit of Cruelty which appears too manifestly in the Iliad.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> was too judicious to imitate <HI>Homer</HI> in these Licences, and is much more reserv'd in his Sarcasms and Insults. There are not above four or five in the whole <HI>Aeneid.</HI> That of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> to <HI>Priam</HI> in the second Book, tho' barbarous in itself, may be accounted for as intended to raise a Character of Horror, and render the Action of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> odious; whereas <HI>Homer</HI> stains his most Favourite Characters with these Barbarities. That of <HI>Ascanius</HI> over <HI>Numanus</HI> in the ninth, was a fair Opportu∣nity where <HI>Virgil</HI> might have indulg'd the Humour of a cruel Raillery, and have been excus'd by the Youth and Gaiety of the Speaker; yet it is no more than a very moderate Answer to the Insolences with which he had just been provok'd by his Enemy, only retorting two of his own Words upon him.

full as well inferr'd from common Sense, the Summer being the natural Season for a Campaign. However he should quote all those Passages at large; and adding to the Article of <HI>Dust</HI> as much as he can find of the <HI>Sweat</HI> of the Heroes, it might fill three Pages very much to his own Satisfaction. It would look well to observe farther, that the Fields are describ'd flowery, <HI>Il.</HI> 2. ℣. 467. that the Branches of a Tamarisk Tree are flourishing, <HI>Il.</HI> 10. ℣. 767. that the Warriors some∣times wash themselves in the Sea, <HI>Il.</HI> 10. ℣. 572. and some∣times refresh themselves by cool Breezes from the Sea, <HI>Il.</HI> 11. ℣. 620. that <HI>Diomed</HI> sleeps out of his Tent on the Ground, <HI>Il.</HI> 10. ℣. 150. that the Flies are very busy about the dead Body of <HI>Patroclus, Il.</HI> 19. ℣. 23. that <HI>Apollo</HI> covers the Bo∣dy of <HI>Hector</HI> with a Cloud to prevent its being scorch'd, <HI>Il.</HI> 23. ℣. 190. All this would prove the very thing which was said at first, that it was Summer. He might next pro∣ceed to enquire, what precise critical Time of Summer? And here the mention of new-made Honey in <HI>Il.</HI> 11. ℣. 630. might be of great Service in the Investigation of this impor∣tant Matter: He would conjecture from hence, that it must be near the end of Summer, Honey being seldom taken till that time; to which having added the Plague which rages in Book 1. and remark'd, that Infections of that kind generally proceed from the extremest Heats, which Heats are not till near the Autumn; the learned Enquirer might hug himself in this Discovery, and conclude with Triumph.</P>
<P>If any one think this too ridiculous to have been ever put in Practice, he may see what <HI>Bossu</HI> has done to determine the precise Season of the <HI>Aeneid, lib.</HI> 3. <HI>ch.</HI> 12. The Memory of that learned Critick fail'd him, when he produc'd as one of the Proofs that it was Autumn, a Passage in the 6<HI>th</HI> Book, where the Fall of the Leaf is only mention'd in a <HI>Simile.</HI> He has also found out a Beauty in <HI>Homer,</HI> which few even of his greatest Admirers can believe he intended; which is, that to the <HI>Violence</HI> and <HI>Fury</HI> of the <HI>Iliad</HI> he artfully adapted the <HI>Heat</HI> of <HI>Summer,</HI> but to the <HI>Odysseis</HI> the <HI>cooler and maturer</HI> Season of <HI>Autumn,</HI> to correspond with the <HI>Sedateness</HI> and <HI>Pru∣dence</HI> of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

Every Circumstance of this Comparison is both beautiful and just; and it is the more to be admir'd, because it is very difficult to find sensible Images proper to represent the Motions of the Mind; wherefore we but rarely meet with such Comparisons even in the best Poets.

This he had only hinted at before; but here taking occasion on the wounded Heroes coming from their Ships, which were at a
<PB N="130" REF="125"/>
distance from the Fight (while others were engag'd in the Defence of those Ships where the Wall was broke down) he tells us, that the Shore of the Bay (comprehended between the <HI>Rhaetean</HI> and <HI>Sigaean</HI> Promontories) was not sufficient to contain the Ships in one Line; which they were therefore obliged to draw up in Ranks, ranged in parallel Lines along the Shore. How many of these Lines there were, the Poet does not determine. M. <HI>Dacier,</HI> without giving any reason for her Opinion, says they were but two; one advanced near the Wall, the other on the Verge of the Sea. But it is more than probable, that there were several intermediate Lines; since the Order in which the Vessels lay is here describ'd by a Metaphor taken from the Steps of a <HI>Scaling-Ladder;</HI> which had been no way proper to give an Image only of two Ranks, but very fit to represent a greater, tho' undetermin'd Num∣ber. That there were more than two Lines, may likewise be inferr'd from what we find in the beginning of the 11<HI>th</HI> Book; where it is said, that the Voice of <HI>Discord,</HI> standing on the Ship of <HI>Ulysses, in the middle of the Fleet,</HI> was heard as far as the Sta∣tions of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Ajax, whose Ships were drawn up in the two Extremities:</HI> Those of <HI>Ajax</HI> were nearest the Wall (as is expresly said in the 68<HI>th</HI> Verse of the 13<HI>th</HI> Book) and those of <HI>Achilles</HI> nearest the Sea, as appears from many Passages scatter'd thro' the Iliad.</P>
<P>It must be suppos'd, that those Ships were drawn highest upon Land, which first approached the Shore; the first Line therefore consisted of those who first disembark'd, which were the Ships of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Protesilaus;</HI> the latter of whom seems mention'd in the Verse above cited of the 13<HI>th</HI> Book, only to give occasion to observe this, for he was slain as he landed first of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> And accordingly we shall see in the 15<HI>th</HI> Book, it is his Ship that is first attack'd by the <HI>Trojans,</HI> as it lay the nearest to them.</P>
<P>We may likewise guess how it happens, that the Ships of <HI>Achilles</HI> were plac'd nearest to the Sea; for in the Answer of <HI>Achilles</HI> to <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the 9<HI>th</HI> Book, ℣. 328. he mentions a Naval Expedition he had made while <HI>Agamemnon</HI> lay safe in the Camp: So that his Ships at their Return did natural∣ly lie next the Sea; which, without this Consideration,

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 179. <HI>The Story of</HI> Jupiter <HI>and</HI> Juno.]</Q> I don't know a bolder Fiction in all Antiquity, than this of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s being deceiv'd and laid asleep, or that has a greater Air of Impiety and Absurdity. 'Tis an Observation of Mons. <HI>de St. Evre∣mond</HI> upon the ancient Poets, which every one will agree to; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it is surprizing enough to find them so scrupulous to preserve Probability, in Actions purely human; and so ready to violate it, in representing the Actions of the Gods. Even those who have spoken more sagely than the rest, of their Nature, could not forbear to speak extravagantly of their Conduct. When they establish their Being and their Attributes, they make them immortal, infinite, almighty, perfectly wise, and perfectly good: But the Moment they represent them acting, there's no Weakness to which they do not make 'em stoop, and no Folly or Wickedness they do not make 'em commit."</Q> The same Author answers this in another Place by remarking, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Truth was not the Inclination of the first Ages: A foolish Lye or a lucky Falshood gave Reputation to Impostors, and Pleasure to the credulous. 'Twas the whole Secret of the great and the wise to govern the simple and ignorant Herd. The vul∣gar, who pay a profound Reverence to mysterious Errors, would have despised plain Truth, and it was thought a piece of Prudence to deceive them. All the Discourses of
<PB N="135" REF="130"/>
the Ancients were fitted to so advantagious a Design. There was nothing to be seen but Fictions, Allegories, and Similitudes, and nothing was to appear as it was in itself."</Q></P>
<P>I must needs, upon the whole, as far as I can judge, give up the Morality of this Fable; but what Colour of Excuse for it <HI>Homer</HI> might have from ancient Tradition, or what mystical or allegorical Sense might attone for the appearing Impiety, is hard to be ascertain'd at this distant Period of Time. That there had been before his Age a Tradition of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s being laid asleep, appears from the Story of <HI>Hercules</HI> at <HI>Coos,</HI> referr'd to by our Author, ℣. 285. There is also a Passage in <HI>Diodorus, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 7. which gives some small Light to this Fiction. Among other Reasons which that Historian lays down to prove that <HI>Homer</HI> travell'd into <HI>Egypt,</HI> he alledges this Passage of the Interview of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno,</HI> which he says was grounded upon an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Festival, <HI>whereon the nuptial Ceremonies of these two Deities were celebrated, at which time both their Tabernacles, adorned with all sorts of Flowers, are carry'd by the Priests to the top of a high Moun∣tain.</HI> Indeed as the greatest Part of the Ceremonies of the ancient Religions consisted in some symbolical Representations of certain Actions of their Gods, or rather deify'd Mortals, so a great part of ancient Poetry consisted in the Description of the Actions exhibited in these Ceremonies. The Loves of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Adonis</HI> are a remarkable Instance of this kind, which, tho' under different Names, were celebrated by annual Representations, as well in <HI>Egypt</HI> as in several Nations of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia:</HI> and to the Images which were carry'd in these Festivals, several ancient Poets were indebted for their most happy Descriptions. If the Truth of this Observation of <HI>Diodorus</HI> be admitted, the present Passage will appear with more Dignity, being grounded on Religion; and the Conduct of the Poet will be more justifiable, if that, which has been generally accounted an indecent wanton Fiction, should prove to be the Representation of a religious Solemnity. Con∣sidering the great Ignorance we are in of many ancient su∣perstitious Ceremonies, there may be probably in <HI>Homer</HI> ma∣ny Incidents entirely of this Nature; wherefore we ought to
<PB N="136" REF="131"/>
be reserv'd in our Censures, lest what we decry as wrong in the Poet, should prove only a Fault in his Religion. And indeed it would be a very unfair way to tax any People, or any Age whatever, with Grossness in general, purely from the gross or absurd Ideas or Practices that are to be found in their Religions.</P>
<P>In the next Place, if we have recourse to Allegory, (which softens and reconciles every thing) it may be imagin'd that by the Congress of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno,</HI> is meant the min∣gling of the <HI>Aether</HI> and the <HI>Air</HI> (which are generally said to be signify'd by these two Deities.) The Ancients believ'd the <HI>Aether</HI> to be Igneous, and that by its kind Influence up∣on the Air it was the Cause of all Vegetation: To which nothing more exactly corresponds, than the Fiction of the Earth putting forth her Flowers immediately upon this Con∣gress. <HI>Virgil</HI> has some Lines in the second <HI>Georgic,</HI> that seem a perfect Explanation of the Fable into this Sense. In describing the Spring, he hints as if something of a vivifying Influence was at that time spread from the upper Heavens in∣to the Air. He calls <HI>Jupiter</HI> expresly <HI>Aether,</HI> and represents him operating upon his Spouse for the Production of all things.<Q><L>Tum pater omnipotens foecundis imbribus aether</L>
<L>Conjugis in gremio laetae descendit, &amp; omnes</L>
<L>Magnus alit, magno commixtus corpore, foetus.</L>
<L>Parturit omnis ager, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But, be all this as it will, it is certain, that whatever may be thought of this Fable in a theological or philosophical View, it is one of the most beautiful Pieces that ever was produc'd by Poetry. Neither does it want its Moral; an ingenious modern Writer (whom I am pleas'd to take any oc∣casion of quoting) has given it us in these Words.</P>

It may possibly offend the Niceness of mo∣dern Ladies; but they who paint so artificially ought to con∣sider that this Practice might, without much greater Difficul∣ty, be reconciled to Cleanliness.

Equipage of a modern Toilette? The Goddess, even when she is setting herself out on the greatest Occasion, has only her own Locks to tie, a white Veil to cast over them, a Mantle to dress her whole Body, her Pendants, and her Sandals.

There are but three ways, where∣by to overcome another, by Violence, by Persuasion, or by Craft: <HI>Jupiter</HI> was invincible by main Force; to think of persuading was as fruitless, after he had pass'd his Nod to <HI>Achilles;</HI> therefore <HI>Juno</HI> was obliged of necessity to turn her Thoughts entirely upon Craft; and by the Force of Plea∣sure it is, that she insnares and manages the God. <HI>Eu∣stathius.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 444. <HI>The Legions march, and</HI> Neptune <HI>leads the way.</HI>]</Q> The chief Advantage the <HI>Greeks</HI> gain by the Sleep of <HI>Jupiter</HI> seems to be this: <HI>Neptune</HI> unwilling to offend <HI>Jupi∣ter,</HI> has hitherto concealed himself in disguised Shapes; so that it does not appear that <HI>Jupiter</HI> knew of his being among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> since he takes no notice of it. This Precaution hinders him from assisting the <HI>Greeks</HI> otherwise than by his Advice. But upon the Intelligence receiv'd of what <HI>Juno</HI> had done, he assumes a Form that manifests his Divinity, in∣spiring Courage into the <HI>Grecian</HI> Chiefs, appearing at the Head of their Army, brandishing a Sword in his Hand, the Sight of which struck such a Terror into the <HI>Trojans</HI> that,
<PB N="153" REF="148"/>
as <HI>Homer</HI> says, none durst approach it. And therefore it is not to be wonder'd, that the <HI>Trojans</HI> who are no longer su∣stain'd by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> immediately give way to the Enemy.</P>

The <HI>Grecian</HI> Legislators punish'd those who cast away their Shields, but not those who lost their Spears or their Swords, as an Intimation, that the Care of preserving and defending our selves is preferable to the wounding our Enemy, espe∣cially in those who are Generals of Armies, or Governors of States."</Q><HI>Eustathius</HI> has observ'd, that the Poet here makes the best Warriors take the largest Shields and longest Spears, that they might be ready prepar'd, with proper Arms, both offensive and defensive, for a new kind of Fight, in which they are soon to be engaged when the Fleet is attack'd. Which indeed seems the most rational Account that can be given for <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Advice in this Exigence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> has committed a great Oversight in this Place; he makes the wounded Princes (who it is plain were unfit for the Battel, and do not engage in the ensuing Fight) put on Arms as well as the others; whereas they do no more in <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> than see their Orders obey'd by the rest as to this Change of Arms.</P>

The Noise and Outcry of this fresh Onset, he endeavours to express by these three sounding Comparisons; as if he thought it necessary to awake the Reader's Attention, which by the preceding De∣scriptions might be lull'd into a Forgetfulness of the Fight.

<P>This Passage cannot be thought justly liable to the Obje∣ctions which have been made against heaping Comparisons one upon another, whereby the principal Object is lost amidst too great a Variety of different Images. In this Case the principal Image is more strongly impress'd on the Mind by a Multiplication of Similes, which are the natural Product of an Imagination labouring to express something very vast: But finding no single Idea sufficient to answer its Conceptions, it endeavours by redoubling the Comparisons to supply this Defect: the different Sounds of Waters, Winds, and Flames being as it were united in one. We have several Instances of this sort even in so castigated and reserv'd a Writer as <HI>Virgil,</HI> who has joined together the Images of this Passage in the 4<HI>th Georgic,</HI> ℣. 261. and apply'd them, beautifully sof∣tened by a kind of Parody, to the buzzing of a Beehive.

<L N="680">The fiery <HI>Spartan</HI> first, with loud Applause,</L>

<L>Is there (he said) in Arms a Youth like you,</L>

<L>Why stand you distant, nor attempt a Deed?</L>
<L N="685">Lift the bold Lance, and make some <HI>Trojan</HI> bleed.</L>

<L>He said, and backward to the Lines retir'd;</L>
<L>Forth rush'd the Youth, with martial Fury fir'd,</L>

<L>And round the black Battalions cast his View.</L>
<L N="690">The Troops of <HI>Troy</HI> recede with sudden Fear,</L>

<L>Advancing <HI>Menalippus</HI> met the Dart</L>
<L>With his bold Breast, and felt it in his Heart:</L>
<L><PB N="193" REF="187"/>
Thund'ring he falls; his falling Arms resound,</L>
<L N="695">And his broad Buckler rings against the Ground.</L>
<L>The Victor leaps upon his prostrate Prize;</L>
<L>Thus on a Roe the well-breath'd Beagle flies,</L>

<L>The distant Hunter sent into his Heart.</L>
<L N="700">Observing <HI>Hector</HI> to the Rescue flew;</L>
<L>Bold as he was, <HI>Antilochus</HI> withdrew:</L>
<L>So when a Savage, ranging o'er the Plain,</L>
<L>Has torn the Shepherd's Dog, or Shepherd Swain;</L>
<L>While conscious of the Deed, he glares around,</L>
<L N="705">And hears the gath'ring Multitude resound,</L>
<L>Timely he flies the yet-untasted Food,</L>
<L>And gains the friendly Shelter of the Wood.</L>
<L>So fears the Youth; all <HI>Troy</HI> with Shouts pursue,</L>
<L>While Stones and Darts in mingled Tempest flew;</L>
<L N="710">But enter'd in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Ranks, he turns</L>
<L>His manly Breast, and with new Fury burns.</L>

<L N="720">Then, nor till then, the Scale of War shall turn,</L>
<L>The <HI>Trojans</HI> fly, and conquer'd <HI>Ilion</HI> burn.</L>

<L>He raises <HI>Hector</HI> to the Work design'd,</L>
<L>Bids him with more than mortal Fury glow,</L>
<L N="725">And drives him, like a Light'ning, on the Foe.</L>
<L>So <HI>Mars,</HI> when human Crimes for Vengeance call,</L>
<L>Shakes his huge Javelin, and whole Armies fall.</L>
<L>Not with more Rage a Conflagration rolls,</L>
<L>Wraps the vast Mountains, and involves the Poles.</L>
<L N="730">He foames with Wrath; beneath his gloomy Brow</L>
<L>Like fiery Meteors his red Eyeballs glow:</L>
<L>The radiant Helmet on his Temples burns,</L>
<L>Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:</L>
<L>For <HI>Jove</HI> his Splendour round the Chief had thrown,</L>

<L>He points his Ardour, and exerts his Might.</L>
<L>The <HI>Grecian</HI> Phalanx moveless as a Tow'r,</L>
<L N="745">On all sides batter'd, yet resists his Pow'r:</L>
<L>So some tall Rock o'erhangs the hoary Main,</L>
<L>By Winds assail'd, by Billows beat in vain,</L>
<L>Unmov'd it hears, above, the Tempest blow,</L>
<L>And sees the watry Mountains break below.</L>
<L N="750">Girt in surrounding Flames, he seems to fall</L>
<L>Like Fire from <HI>Jove,</HI> and bursts upon them all:</L>
<L>Bursts as a Wave, that from the Clouds impends,</L>
<L>And swell'd with Tempests on the Ship descends;</L>
<L>White are the Decks with Foam; the Winds aloud</L>
<L N="755">Howl o'er the Masts, and sing thro' ev'ry Shroud:</L>
<L>Pale, trembling, tir'd, the Sailors freeze with Fears;</L>
<L>And instant Death on ev'ry Wave appears.</L>
<L>So pale the <HI>Greeks</HI> the Eyes of <HI>Hector</HI> meet,</L>

<L><HI>Minerva</HI> seconds what the Sage inspires.</L>
<L>The Mist of Darkness <HI>Jove</HI> around them threw,</L>
<L>She clear'd, restoring all the War to view;</L>

<L>And shew'd the Shores, the Navy, and the Main:</L>
<L><HI>Hector</HI> they saw, and all who fly, or fight,</L>
<L>The Scene wide-opening to the Blaze of Light.</L>
<L>First of the Field, great <HI>Ajax</HI> strikes their Eyes,</L>
<L N="815">His Port majestick, and his ample Size:</L>
<L>A pond'rous Mace, with Studs of Iron crown'd,</L>
<L>Full twenty Cubits long, he swings around.</L>
<L>Nor fights like others, fix'd to certain Stands,</L>
<L>But looks a moving Tow'r above the Bands;</L>
<L N="820">High on the Decks, with vast gigantic Stride,</L>
<L>The godlike Hero stalks from side to side.</L>
<L>So when a Horseman from the watry Mead</L>
<L>(Skill'd in the Manage of the bounding Steed)</L>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 67. Greece <HI>chas'd by</HI> Troy, &amp;c.]</Q> In this Discourse of <HI>Jupiter</HI> the Poet opens his Design, by giving his Readers a Sketch of the principal Events he is to expect. As this Conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> may to many appear no way artful, and since it is a principal Article of the Charge brought against him by some late <HI>French</HI> Criticks, it will not be improper here to look a little into this Dispute. The Case will be best stated by translating the following Passage from Mr. <HI>de la Motte</HI>'s <HI>Reflections sur la Critique.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I could not forbear wishing that <HI>Homer</HI> had an Art, which he seems to have neglected, that of preparing Events without making them known beforehand, so that when they happen one might be surprized agreeably. I could not be quite satisfied to hear <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in the middle of the Iliad, give an exact Abridgment of the Remainder of the Action. Mad. <HI>Dacier</HI> alledges as an Excuse, that this past only between <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno;</HI> as if the Reader was not let into the Secret, and had not as much share in the Confidence.</Q></P>
<P>She adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that as we are capable of a great deal of Plea∣sure at the Representation of a Tragedy which we have seen before, so the Surprizes which I require are no way necessary to our Entertainment. This I think a pure Piece of Sophistry: One may have two sorts of Pleasure at the Representation of a Tragedy; in the first place, that of taking part in an Action of Importance the first time it passes before our Eyes, of being agitated by Fear and Hope for the Persons one is most concern'd about, and in fine, of partaking their Felicity or Misfortune, as they happen to succeed, or be disappointed.
<P>"This therefore is the first Pleasure which the Poet should design to give his Auditors, to transport them by pathetic
<PB N="209" REF="202"/>
Surprizes which excite Terror or Pity. The second Plea∣sure must proceed from a View of that Art which the Au∣thor has shewn in raising the former.</P>
<P>"'Tis true, when we have seen a Piece already, we have no longer that first Pleasure of the Surprize, at least not in all its Vivacity; but there still remains the second, which could never have its turn, had not the Poet labour'd suc∣cessfully to excite the first, it being upon that indispensable Obligation that we judge of his Art.</P>
<P>"The Art therefore consists in telling the Hearer only what is necessary to be told him, and in telling him only as much as is requisite to the Design of pleasing him. And altho' we know this already when we read it a second time, we yet taste the Pleasure of that Order and Conduct which the Art required.</P>
<P>"From hence it follows, that every Poem ought to be contrived for the first Impression it is to make. If it be otherwise, it gives us (instead of two Pleasures which we expected) two sorts of Disgusts; the one, that of being cool and untouch'd when we should be mov'd and trans∣ported; the other, that of perceiving the Defect which caus'd that Disgust.</P>
<P>"This, in one word, is what I have found in the Iliad. I was not interested or touch'd by the Adventures, and I saw it was this cooling Preparation that prevented my being so."</P></Q></P>
<P>It appears clearly that M. <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Defence no way excuses the Poet's Conduct; wherefore I shall add two or three Con∣siderations which may chance to set it in a better Light. It must be own'd that a Surprize artfully managed, which arises from unexpected Revolutions of great Actions, affects the Mind with a peculiar Delight: In this consists the prin∣cipal Pleasure of a Romance and well writ Tragedy. But be∣sides this, there is in the Relation of great Events a different kind of Pleasure which arises from the artful unravelling a Knot of Actions, which we knew before in the gross. This is a Delight peculiar to History and Epic Poetry, which is founded on History. In these kinds of writing, a preceding summary Knowledge of the Events described, does no way
<PB N="210" REF="203"/>
damp our Curiosity, but rather makes it more eager for the Detail. This is evident in a good History, where ge∣nerally the Reader is affected with a greater Delight, in pro∣portion to his preceding Knowledge of the Facts described: The Pleasure in this case is like that of an Architect first viewing some magnificent Building, who was before well ac∣quainted with the Proportions of it. In an Epic Poem the case is of a like Nature; where, as if the historical Fore-know∣ledge were not sufficient, the most judicious Poets never fail to excite their Reader's Curiosity by some small Sketches of their Design; which like the Outlines of a fine Picture, will necessarily raise in us a greater desire to see it in its fi∣nish'd Colouring.</P>
<P>Had our Author been inclined to follow the Method of managing our Passions by Surprizes, he could not well have succeeded by this manner in the Subject he chose to write upon, which being a Story of great Importance, the principal Events of which were well known to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> it was not possible for him to alter the Ground-work of his Piece; and probably he was willing to mark by these Recapitulations how much of his Story was founded on historical Truths, and that what is superadded were the poetical Ornaments.</P>
<P>There is another Consideration worth remembring on this Head, to justify our Author's Conduct. It seems to have been an Opinion in these early times, deeply rooted in most Countries and Religions, that the Actions of Men were not only foreknown, but predestinated by a superior Being. This Sentiment is very frequent in the most ancient Writers both sacred and prophane, and seems a distinguishing Character of the Writings of the greatest Antiquity. <HI>The Word of the Lord was fulfill'd,</HI> is the principal Observation in the History of the Old Testament, and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the declared and most obvious Moral of the Iliad. If this great Moral be fit to be represented in Poetry, what Means so proper to make it evident, as this introducing <HI>Jupiter</HI> foretelling the Events which he had decreed?</P>

<L>Thus while he thought, beside him <HI>Phoebus</HI> stood,</L>

<L N="915">Thus for some slaughter'd Hind, with equal Rage,</L>

<L>While all around, Confusion, Rage, and Fright</L>
<L>Mix the contending Hosts in mortal Fight.</L>
<L>So pent by Hills, the wild Winds roar aloud</L>
<L>In the deep Bosom of some gloomy Wood;</L>
<L N="925">Leaves, Arms, and Trees aloft in Air are blown,</L>

<L>This way and that, the ratt'ling Thicket bends,</L>
<L>And the whole Forest in one Crash descends.</L>
<L>Not with less Noise, with less tumultuous Rage,</L>

<L>Then rash <HI>Patroclus</HI> with new Fury glows,</L>

<L>The weighty Shock his Neck and Shoulders feel;</L>
<L>His Eyes flash Sparkles, his stunn'd Senses reel</L>

<L N="960"><HI>Achilles'</HI> Plume is stain'd with Dust and Gore;</L>

<L><HI>Jove</HI> dooms it now on <HI>Hector</HI>'s Helm to nod;</L>
<L N="965">Not long—For Fate pursues him, and the God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Spear in Shivers falls: His ample Shield</L>
<L>Drops from his Arm: his Baldrick strows the Field:</L>
<L>The Corselet his astonish'd Breast forsakes:</L>
<L>Loose is each Joint; each Nerve with Horror shakes.</L>
<L N="970">Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:</L>
<L>Such is the Force of more than mortal Hands!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A <HI>Dardan</HI> Youth there was, well-known to Fame,</L>

Fam'd for the Manage of the foaming Horse,</L>
<L N="975">Skill'd in the Dart, and matchless in the Course:</L>

<L>Thus, by an Arm divine, and mortal Spear,</L>
<L>Wounded at once, <HI>Patroclus</HI> yields to fear,</L>
<L N="985">Retires for Succour to his social Train,</L>
<L>And flies the Fate, which Heav'n decreed, in vain.</L>
<L>Stern <HI>Hector,</HI> as the bleeding Chief he views,</L>

<L>The Lance arrests him with a mortal Wound;</L>
<L N="990">He falls, Earth thunders, and his Arms resound.</L>
<L>With him all <HI>Greece</HI> was sunk; that Moment all</L>

<L>So scorch'd with Heat along the desart Shore,</L>

Fast by the Spring; they both dispute the Flood,</L>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>WE have at the Entrance of this Book one of the most beautiful Parts of the Iliad. The two different Characters are admirably sustain'd in the Dialogue of the two Heroes, wherein there is not a Period but strongly marks not only their na∣tural Temper, but that particular Disposition of Mind in either, which arises from the present State of Affairs. We see <HI>Pa∣troclus</HI> touch'd with the deepest Compassion for the Misfortune of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> (whom the <HI>Trojans</HI> had forc'd to retreat to their Ships, and which Ships were on the Point of burning) prostrating himself before the Vessel of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and pour∣ing out his Tears at his Feet. <HI>Achilles,</HI> struck with the Grief of his Friend, demands the Cause of it. <HI>Patroclus,</HI> pointing to the Ships, where the Flames already began to rise, tells him he is harder than the Rocks or Sea which lay in prospect before them, if he is not touch'd with so mo∣ving a Spectacle, and can see in cold Blood his Friends pe∣rishing before his Eyes. As nothing can be more natural and affecting than the Speech of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> so nothing is more lively and Picturesque than the Attitude he is here describ'd in.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="274"/>
The <HI>Pathetic</HI> of <HI>Patroclus</HI>'s Speech is finely contrasted by the <HI>Fiertè</HI> of that of <HI>Achilles.</HI> While the former is melting with Sorrow for his Countrymen, the utmost he can hope from the latter, is but to borrow his Armour and Troops; to obtain his personal Assistance he knows is impossible. At the very Instant that <HI>Achilles</HI> is mov'd to ask the Cause of his Friend's Concern, he seems to say that nothing could deserve it but the Death of their Fathers: and in the same Breath speaks of the total Destruction of the <HI>Greeks</HI> as of too slight a Cause for Tears. <HI>Patroclus,</HI> at the opening of this Speech, dares not name <HI>Agamemnon</HI> even for being wounded; and af∣ter he has tried to bend him by all the Arguments that could affect an human Breast, concludes by supposing that some Oracle or supernatual Inspiration is the Cause that with-holds his Arms. What can match the Fierceness of his Answer? Which implies, that not the Oracles of Heaven itself should be regarded, if they stood in Competition with his Resent∣ment: That if he yields, it must be thro' his own mere Mo∣tive: The only reason he has ever to yield, is that Nature itself cannot support Anger eternally: And if he yields now, it is only because he had before determin'd to do so at a cer∣tain time, (<HI>Il.</HI> 9. ℣. 773.) That time was not till the Flames should approach to his own Ships, till the last Article of Dan∣ger, and that not of Danger to <HI>Greece,</HI> but to himself. Thus his very Pity has the sternest Qualifications in the World. After all, what is it he yields to? Only to suffer his Friend to go in his stead, just to save them from present Ruin, but he expressly forbids him to proceed any farther in their As∣sistance, than barely to put out the Fires, and secure his own and his Friend's Return into their Country: And all this concludes with a Wish, that (if it were possible) every <HI>Greek</HI> and every <HI>Trojan</HI> might perish except themselves. Such is that <HI>Wrath</HI> of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that more than Wrath, as the <HI>Greek</HI><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> implies, which <HI>Homer</HI> has painted in so strong a Co∣louring.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 8. <HI>Indulgent to his best belov'd.</HI>]</Q> The Friendship of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Patroclus</HI> is celebrated by all Antiquity: And <HI>Homer,</HI> notwithstanding the Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> was his pro∣fess'd Subject, has found the Secret to discover, thro' that ve∣ry Anger, the softer Parts of his Character. In this View we shall find him generous in his Temper, despising Gain and Booty, and as far as his Honour is not concern'd, fond of his Mistress, and easy to his Friend: Not proud, but when injur'd; and not more revengeful when ill us'd, than grate∣ful and gentle when respectfully treated. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Patroclus</HI> (says <HI>Philostratus,</HI> who probably grounds his Assertion on some an∣cient Tradition) was not so much elder than <HI>Achilles</HI> as to pretend to direct him, but of a tender, modest, and unas∣suming Nature; constant and diligent in his Attendance, and seeming to have no Affections but those of his Friend."</Q> The same Author has a very pretty Passage, where <HI>Ajax</HI> is introduced enquiring of <HI>Achilles,</HI><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Which of all his warlike Actions were the most difficult and dangerous to him? He answers, Those which he undertook for the sake of his Friends. And which (continues <HI>Ajax</HI>) were the most pleasing and easy?

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 285. Dodonaean Jove.]</Q> The frequent mention of <HI>Oracles</HI> in <HI>Homer</HI> and the ancient Authors, may make it not improper to give the Reader a general Account of so consi∣derable a part of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Superstition; which I cannot do better than in the Words of my Friend Mr. <HI>Stanyan,</HI> in his excellent and judicious Abstract of the <HI>Grecian</HI> History.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>Oracles</HI> were rank'd among the noblest and most reli∣gious kinds of Divination; the Design of them being to set∣tle such an immediate way of Converse with their Gods, as to be able by them not only to explain things intricate and obscure, but also to anticipate the Knowledge of future Events; and that with far greater Certainty than they could hope for from Men, who out of Ignorance and Pre∣judice must sometimes either conceal or betray the Truth. So that this became the only safe way of deliberating upon Affairs of any Consequence, either publick or private. Whether to proclaim War, or conclude a Peace, to insti∣tute a new Form of Government, or enact new Laws, all was to be done with the Advice and Approbation of the Oracle, whose Determinations were always held sacred and inviolable. As to the Causes of Oracles, <HI>Jupiter</HI> was look'd upon as the first Cause of this, and all other sorts of Divi∣nation; he had the Book of Fate before him, and out of that reveal'd either more or less, as he pleas'd, to inferior Daemons. But to argue more rationally, this way of Ac∣cess to the Gods has been branded as one of the earliest and grossest Pieces of Priestcraft, that obtain'd in the World. For the Priests, whose Dependance was on the Oracles, when they found the Cheat had got sufficient footing, allow'd no Man to consult the Gods without cost∣ly Sacrifices and rich Presents to themselves: And as few could bear this Expence, it serv'd to raise their Credit among the common People, by keeping them at an awful distance. And to heighten their Esteem with the better and wealthier sort, even they were only admitted upon a
<PB N="299" REF="289"/>
few stated Days: By which the thing appear'd still more mysterious, and for want of this good Management, must quickly have been seen through, and fell to the Ground. But whatever juggling there was as to the religious Part, Ora∣cles had certainly a good Effect as to the Publick; being admirably suited to the Genius of a People, who would join in the most desperate Expedition, and admit of any Change of Government, when they understood by the O∣racle it was the irresistible Will of the Gods. This was the Method <HI>Minos, Lycurgus,</HI> and all the famous Lawgivers took; and indeed they found the People so entirely devo∣ted to this Part of Religion, that it was generally the ea∣siest, and sometimes the only way of winning them into a Compliance. And then they took care to have them deliver'd in such ambiguous Terms, as to admit of diffe∣rent Constructions according to the Exigency of the Times; so that they were generally interpreted to the Ad∣vantage of the State, unless sometimes there happen'd to be Bribery, or Flattery in the Case; as when <HI>Demosthenes</HI> complain'd that the <HI>Pythia</HI> spoke as <HI>Philip</HI> would have her. The most numerous, and of greatest Repute were the Oracles of <HI>Apollo,</HI> who in Subordination to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> was appointed to preside over, and inspire all sorts of Pro∣phets and Diviners. And amongst these, the <HI>Delphian</HI> challeng'd the first Place, not so much in respect of its Anti∣quity, as its Perspicuity and Certainty; insomuch that the Answers of the <HI>Tripos</HI> came to be used proverbially for clear and infallible Truths. Here we must not omit the first <HI>Pythia</HI> or Priestess of this famous Oracle in heroic Verse. They found a secret Charm in Numbers, which made every thing look pompous and weighty. And hence it became the general Practice of Legislators, and Philoso∣phers, to deliver their Laws and Maxims in that Dress: And scarce any thing in those Ages was writ of Excellence or Moment but in Verse. This was the Dawn of Poetry. which soon grew into Repute; and so long as it serv'd to such noble Purposes as Religion and Government, Poets were highly honour'd, and admitted into a Share of the Administration. But by that time it arriv'd to any Perfe∣ction,
<PB N="300" REF="290"/>
they pursu'd more mean and servile Ends; and as they prostituted their Muse, and debased the Subject, they sunk proportionably in their Esteem and Dignity. As to the History of Oracles, we find them mention'd in the ve∣ry Infancy of <HI>Greece;</HI> and it is as uncertain when they were finally extinct, as when they began. For they often lost their prophetick Faculty for some time, and recover'd it again. I know 'tis a common Opinion, that they were universally silenc'd upon our Saviour's Appearance in the World: And if the Devil had been permitted for so ma∣ny Ages to delude Mankind, it might probably have been so. But we are assur'd from History, that several of them continu'd till the Reign of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, and were consulted by him: And therefore I look upon the whole Business as of human Contrivance; an egregious Imposture founded upon Superstition, and carry'd on by Policy and Interest, till the brighter Oracles of the holy Scriptures dispell'd these Mists of Error and Enthusiasm."</Q></P>

Never∣theless I am obliged to say, that <HI>Strabo,</HI> who speaks very much at length of these <HI>Selli</HI> in his 7<HI>th</HI> Book, has not taken this Austerity of Life for an Effect of their Devotion, but for a Remain of the Grossness of their Ancestors; who being Barbarians, and straying from Country to Country, had no Bed but the Earth, and never used a Bath. But it is no way un∣likely that what was in the first <HI>Pelasgians</HI> (who founded this Oracle) only Custom and Use, might be continu'd by these Priests thro' Devotion. How many things do we at this Day see, which were in their Original only ancient Manner, and which are continu'd thro' Zeal and a Spirit of Religion? It is very probable that these Priests by this hard living had a mind to attract the Admiration and Confidence of a People who lov'd Luxury and Delicacy so much. I was willing to search into Antiquity for the Original of these <HI>Selli,</HI> Priests of <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI> but found nothing so ancient as <HI>Homer: Herodotus</HI> writes in his second Book, that the Oracle of <HI>Dodona</HI> was the ancientest in <HI>Greece,</HI> and that it was a long time the only one; but what he adds, that it was founded by an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Woman, who was the Priestess of it, is contradicted by this Passage of <HI>Homer,</HI> who shews, that in the time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War this Temple was serv'd by Men call'd <HI>Selli,</HI> and not by Women. <HI>Strabo</HI> informs us of a curious ancient Tradi∣tion, importing, that this Temple was at first built in <HI>Thes∣saly,</HI>

that from thence it was carry'd into <HI>Dodona,</HI> that seve∣ral Women who had plac'd their Devotion there follow'd it, and that in Process of Time the Priestesses used to be cho∣sen from among the Descendents of those Women. To re∣turn to these <HI>Selli; Sophocles,</HI> who of all the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets is he who has most imitated <HI>Homer,</HI> speaks in like manner of these Priests in one of his Plays, where <HI>Hercules</HI> says to his Son <HI>Hillus;</HI><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will declare to thee a new Oracle, which perfectly agrees with this ancient one; I my self having enter'd into the sacred Wood inhabited by the austere <HI>Selli,</HI> who lie on the Ground, writ this Answer of the Oak, which is consecrated to my Father <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and which ren∣ders his Oracles in all Languages."</Q><HI>Dacier.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 288.] <HI>Homer</HI> in this Verse uses a word which I think singular and remarkable, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> I cannot believe that it was put simply for <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but am persuaded that this Term includes some particular Sense, and shews some Cu∣stom but little known, which I would willingly discover. In the Scholia of <HI>Didymus</HI> there is this Remark: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They call'd those who serv'd in the Temple, and who explain'd the Ora∣cles render'd by the Priests, <HI>Hypothets,</HI> or <HI>Under-Prophets.</HI>"</Q> It is certain that there were in the Temples Servitors, or Sub∣altern Ministers, who for the sake of Gain, undertook to ex∣plain the Oracles which were obscure. This Custom seems very well establish'd in the <HI>Ion</HI> of <HI>Euripides;</HI> where that young Child (after having said that the Priestess is seated on the Tripod, and renders the Oracles which <HI>Apollo</HI> dictates to her) addresses himself to those who serve in the Temple, and bids them go and wash in the <HI>Castalian</HI> Fountain, to come again into the Temple and explain the Oracles to those who should demand the Explication of them. <HI>Homer</HI> therefore means to shew, that these <HI>Selli</HI> were, in the Temple of <HI>Dodona,</HI> those Subaltern Ministers that interpreted the Oracles. But this, after all, does not appear to agree with the present Passage: For, besides that the Custom was not establish'd in <HI>Homer</HI>'s
<PB N="303" REF="293"/>
Time, and that there is no Footstep of it founded in that early Age; these <HI>Selli</HI> (of whom <HI>Homer</HI> speaks) are not here Ministers subordinate to others, they are plainly the chief Priests. The Explication of this word therefore must be else∣where sought, and I shall offer my Conjecture, which I ground upon the very Nature of this Oracle of <HI>Dodona,</HI> which was very different from all the other Oracles: In all other Temples the Priests deliver'd the Oracle which they had receiv'd from their Gods, immediately: But in the Tem∣ple of <HI>Dodona, Jupiter</HI> did not utter his Oracles to his Priests, but to his <HI>Selli;</HI> he render'd them to the Oaks, and the wonderful Oaks render'd them to the Priests, who declared them to those who consulted them: So these Priests were not properly <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Prophets, since they did not re∣ceive those Answers from the Mouth of their God immedi∣ately; but they were <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Under-Prophets, because they receiv'd them from the Mouth of the Oaks, if I may say so. The Oaks, properly speaking, were the Prophets, the first Interpreters of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Oracles; and the <HI>Selli</HI> were <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Under-Prophets, because they pronounc'd what the Oaks had said.

So that the nicest Criticks cannot find any thing to offend their Delicacy, but must be obliged to own the Manners of this Hero perfect.

of a Nature celestial and uncorruptible. But this last Remark is impertinent, since we see in this very Place <HI>Apollo</HI> is employ'd in adorning and embalming the Body of <HI>Sarpedon.</HI></P>

<P>But after all these refin'd Observations, it is probable the Poet intended only to represent the Death of this favourite Son of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and one of his most amiable Characters, in a gentle and agreeable View, without any Circumstances of Dread or Horror; intimating by this Fiction, that he was delivered out of all the Tumults and Miseries of Life by two imaginary Deities, <HI>Sleep</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> who alone can give Mankind Ease and Exemption from their Misfortunes.</P>

I hope, af∣ter so free a Confession, no reasonable Modern will think me touch'd with the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> and others. I am sensible of the Extremes which Mankind run into, in extolling and depreciating Authors: We are not more violent and unreasonable in attacking those who are not yet establish'd into Fame, than in defending those who are, even in every minute Trifle. Fame is a Debt, which when we have kept from People as long as we can, we pay with a prodigi∣ous Interest, which amounts to twice the Value of the Prin∣cipal. Thus 'tis with ancient Works as with ancient Coins, they pass for a vast deal more than they were worth at first; and the very Obscurities and Deformities which Time has thrown upon them, are the sacred Rust, which enhances their Value with all true Lovers of Antiquity.</P>
<P>But as I have own'd what seem my Author's Faults, and subscrib'd to the Opinion of <HI>Horace,</HI> that <HI>Homer</HI> sometimes nods; I think I ought to add that of <HI>Longinus</HI> as to such Negligences. I can no way so well conclude the Notes to this Book as with the Translation of it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It may not be improper to discuss the Question in ge∣neral, which of the two is the more estimable, a faulty Sublime, or a faultless Mediocrity? And consequent∣ly, if of two Works, one has the greater Number of Beauties, and the other attains directly to the Sublime, which of these shall in Equity carry the Prize? I am really persuaded that the true Sublime is incapable of that Purity which we find in Compositions of a lower Strain, and in effect that too much Accuracy sinks the Spirit of an Author; whereas the Case is generally the same with the Favourites of Nature, and those of Fortune, who with the best Oeconomy cannot, in the great Abundance they are blest with, attend to the minuter Articles of their Expence. Writers of a cool Imagination are cautious in their Management, and venture nothing, merely to gain the Character of being correct; but the Sublime is bold and enterprizing, not∣withstanding that on every Advance the Danger encreaseth. Here probably some will say that Men take a malicious Sa∣tisfaction in exposing the Blemishes of an Author; that his
<PB N="319" REF="309"/>
Errors are never forgot, while the most exquisite Beauties leave but very imperfect Traces on the Memory. To ob∣viate this Objection I will solemnly declare, that in my Criticisms on <HI>Homer</HI> and other Authors, who are univer∣sally allow'd to be authentic Standards of the Sublime, tho' I have censur'd their Failings with as much Freedom as any one, yet I have not presum'd to accuse them of vo∣luntary Faults, but have gently remark'd some little Defects and Negligences, which the Mind being intent on nobler Ideas did not condescend to regard. And on these Prin∣ciples I will venture to lay it down for a Maxim, that the Sublime (purely on account of its Grandeur) is preferable to all other kinds of Style, however it may fall into some Inequalities. The Argonauticks of <HI>Apollonius</HI> are faultless in their kind; and <HI>Theocritus</HI> hath shewn the happiest Vein imaginable for Pastorals, excepting those in which he has deviated from the Country: And yet if it were put to your Choice, would you have your Name descend to Posterity with the Reputation of either of those Poets, rather than with that of <HI>Homer?</HI> Nothing can be more correct than the <HI>Erigone</HI> of <HI>Eratosthenes;</HI> but is he therefore a greater Poet than <HI>Archilochus,</HI> in whose Composures Perspicuity and Order are often wanting; the divine Fury of his Genius be∣ing too impatient for Restraint, and superior to Law? Again, do you prefer the Odes of <HI>Bacchilides</HI> to <HI>Pindar</HI>'s, or the Scenes of <HI>Ion</HI> of <HI>Chios</HI> to those of <HI>Sophocles?</HI> Their Writings are allow'd to be correct, polite, and delicate; whereas, on the other Hand, <HI>Pindar</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI> some∣times hurry on with the greatest Impetuosity, and like a devouring Flame seize and set on Fire whatever comes in their way; but on a sudden the Conflagration is extin∣guish'd, and they most miserably flag when no body ex∣pects it. Yet none have so little Discernment as not to pre∣fer the single <HI>Oedipus</HI> of <HI>Sophocles</HI> to all the Tragedies that <HI>Ion</HI> ever brought on the Stage.<P>"In our Decisions therefore on the Characters of these great Men, who have illustrated what is useful and neces∣sary with all the Graces and Elevation of Style; we must impartially confess that, with all their Errors, they have
<PB N="320" REF="310"/>
more Perfections than the Nature of Man can almost be conceiv'd capable of attaining: For 'tis merely human to excell in other kinds of Writing, but the Sublime enno∣bleth our Nature, and makes near Approaches to Di∣vinity: He who commits no Faults, is barely read without Censure; but a Genius truly great excites Admiration. In short, the Magnificence of a single Period in one of these admirable Authors is sufficient to attone for all their De∣fects: Nay farther, if any one should collect from <HI>Homer, Demosthenes, Plato,</HI> and other celebrated Heroes of Anti∣quity, the little Errors that have escap'd them; they would not bear the least Proportion to the infinite Beauties to be met with in every Page of their Writings. 'Tis on this account that Envy, thro' so many Ages, hath never been able to wrest from them the Prize of Eloquence which-their Merits have so justly acquir'd: An Acquisi∣tion which they still are, and will, in all Probability conti∣nue possess'd of,<Q><L>As long as Streams in silver Mazes rove,</L>
