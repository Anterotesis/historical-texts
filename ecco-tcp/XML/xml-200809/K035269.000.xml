<HEAD>DAN and JANE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GOOD Dan and Jane were man and wife,</L>
<L>And liv'd a loving kind of life;</L>
<L>One point, however, they disputed,</L>
<L>And each by turns his mate confuted.</L>
<L>'Twas Faith and Works—this knotty question</L>
<L>They found not easy of digestion.</L>
<L>While Dan for Faith alone contended,</L>
<L>Jane equally Good Works defended.</L>
<L>"They are not Christians sure, but Turks,</L>
<L>"Who build on Faith and scoff at Works."</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Quoth Jane—While eager Dan reply'd,</L>
<L>"By none but heathens Faith's deny'd.</L>
<L>"I'll tell you wife," at length quoth Dan,</L>
<L>"A story of a right good man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"A Patriarch sage, of ancient days,</L>
<L>"A man of Faith, whom all must praise.</L>
<L>"In his own country he possess'd,</L>
<L>"Whate'er can make a wise man blest;</L>
<L>"His was the flock, the field, the spring,</L>
<L>"In short, a little rural king.</L>
<L>"Yet, pleas'd he quits this native land,</L>
<L>"By Faith in the Divine command.</L>
<L>"God bade him go, and he, content,</L>
<L>"Went forth not knowing where he went.</L>
<L>"He trusted in the promise made,</L>
<L>"And, undisputing, strait obeyed.</L>
<L>"The Heavenly word he did not doubt,</L>
<L>"But prov'd his Faith by going out."</L>
<L>Jane answer'd with some little pride—</L>
<L>"I've an example on my side;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
"And tho' my tale be somewhat longer,</L>
<L>"I trust you'll find it vastly stronger.</L>
<L>"I'll tell you, Daniel, of a man,</L>
<L>"The holiest since the world began;</L>
<L>"Who now God's favour is receiving,</L>
<L>"For prompt <HI>obeying,</HI> not <HI>believing.</HI></L>
<L>"One only son this man possest,</L>
<L>"In whom his righteous age was blest;</L>
<L>"And more to mark the grace of Heaven,</L>
<L>"This son by miracle was given.</L>
<L>"And from this child the word Divine</L>
<L>"Had promis'd an illustrious line.</L>
<L>"When lo! at once a voice he hears,</L>
<L>"Which sounds like thunder in his ears,</L>
<L>"God says—Go sacrifice thy son!</L>
<L>"—This moment, Lord, it shall be done.</L>
<L>"He goes, and instantly prepares,</L>
<L>"To slay this child of many prayers.</L>
<L>"Now here you see the grand expedience,</L>
<L>"Of <HI>Works,</HI> of actual sound <HI>Obedience.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
"This was not <HI>Faith,</HI> but <HI>act</HI> and deed,</L>
<L>"The Lord commands—the child shall bleed.</L>
<L>"Thus Abraham <HI>acted,"</HI> Jenny cried;</L>
<L>"Thus Abraham <HI>trusted,"</HI> Dan replied.</L>
<L>"Abraham," quoth Jane, "why that's my man,</L>
<L>"No, Abraham's him I mean," says Dan.</L>
<L>"He stands a monument of <HI>Faith;"</HI>—</L>
<L>"No, 'tis for <HI>Works</HI> the Scripture saith."</L>
<L>"'Tis for his faith that I defend him:"</L>
<L>"'Tis for obedience I commend him."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he—thus she—both warmly feel,</L>
<L>And lose their temper in their zeal;</L>
<L>Too quick each other's choice to blame,</L>
<L>They did not see each meant the same.</L>
<L>"At length, good wife," said honest Dan,</L>
<L>"We're talking of the self same man.</L>
<L>"The works you praise I own indeed,</L>
<L>"Grow from that faith for which I plead;</L>
<L>"And Abraham, whom for faith I quote,</L>
<L>"For works deserves especial note:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
"Tis not enough of faith to <HI>talk,</HI></L>
<L>"A man of God, with God must walk:</L>
<L>"Our doctrines are at last the same,</L>
<L>"They only differ in the name.</L>
<L>"The faith I fight for is the root,</L>
<L>"The works you value are the fruit.</L>
<L>"How shall you know my creed's sincere,</L>
<L>"Unless in works my faith appear?</L>
<L>"How shall I know a tree's alive,</L>
<L>"Unless I see it bear and thrive?</L>
<L>"Your works not growing on my root,</L>
<L>"Wou'd prove they were not genuine fruit.</L>
<L>"If faith produce no works, I see,</L>
<L>"That faith is not a living tree.</L>
<L>"Thus faith and works together grow,</L>
<L>"No separate life they e'er can know:</L>
<L>"They're soul and body, hand and heart,</L>
<L>"What God hath join'd, let no one part.</L>
