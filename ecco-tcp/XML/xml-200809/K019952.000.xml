<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a just image given us by Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> of the situation of an author, where he mentions a POET ambitious of praise, and a CRITIC picking his pocket. It is, indeed, almost im∣possible for any man to distinguish himself in the literary world, without having a gang of these people swarming about him; though he has at the same time this consolation, that all such <HI>petty larceny</HI> attempts are a mark of his fame; and the unpro∣voked abuse of ill-designing persons is, in its own nature, invo∣luntary praise.</P>
<P>The author of the following trifle has had his share of this kind of trouble ever since his name has been heard of: he has boasted, upon a former occasion, of the honour a certain reverend writer did him by his calumny; but, as if that was not suffi∣cient, his name is now adorned with a PARSON CHURCHILL. This last person's hand he has felt in his pocket twice in a very short time: in the <HI>Rosciad</HI> it was but a dip, and away; but as if
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>this astonishing genius, who has lately amazed mankind, had improved in his trade, in his <HI>Apology</HI> he has attempted to make an intire rummage. Whether he has taken any thing out of the present writer's pocket, is a point not very certain; so that the loss, however, cannot be very great.</P>
<P>But it may be asked, Can the Reverend Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> Curate of <HI>St. John's, Westminster,</HI> be considered as Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI>'s lite∣rary pickpocket, when he boldly owns his name, and shews himself to the public?—In answer to this, it should be consi∣dered, that these people have various ways of doing their busi∣ness. Some of them sneak in alleys, and little lurking holes, and, as a gentleman passes by, they make a snatch at his pocket; and should they prove so unfortunate as to give an alarm, and meet with a short turn, "<HI>Pray remember the poor—for the love of</HI>—" Others of them go more daringly to work—<Q>Bob, <HI>do you see that gentleman yonder?—shall I</HI> DO <HI>him?</HI></Q>—<Q><HI>Ay! ay!</HI> cries Bob, <HI>do him by all means.</HI></Q>— <Q><HI>So I will—Link your honour—light your honour across the street—my name is</HI> CHARLEY DUNGHILL—<HI>I ply here every night, your honour</HI>—</Q> Then on he runs, twirling his link almost in your face;—gives you an unlucky splash, and, in your sudden confusion, makes a snap at your handkerchief: his friends admire his dexterity; he is proclaimed abroad for a notable clever fellow; you are told he is a bruiser into the bargain, and handles an OAK-STICK won∣derfully!
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>This will be acknowledged to be the case among the pilferers in our common streets; and among their brethren of the quill the conduct is so similar, that the writer of the subsequent Ode cannot consider the REVEREND CHARLES CHURCHILL in any other light than that of a CRITIC PICKING HIS POCKET; and as he is well informed that Mr. <HI>John Fielding</HI> has attained many points, highly serviceable to society, by <HI>quick notice and sudden pursuit</HI> among the nimble-fingered race, who infest this metropolis, he is in hopes that the same means will operate equally in the literary world. For this purpose, he now thinks proper to celebrate the egregious endowments of this New Adventurer; desiring it may be remembered, that this is the first notice he has given of him: for, notwithstanding the insinuations of Mr. <HI>Churchill</HI> and his friends, be it hereby known, that Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI> never wrote, or caused to be written, directly or indirectly, a single line in the <HI>Critical Review.</HI> In justice, however, to the public, and him∣self, he thinks it now incumbent on him to give the best de∣scription he can of the man who has, at two different times, made an attempt upon him. Should this furious <HI>Drawcansir,</HI> after this, think proper to proceed in his design, Mr. <HI>Murphy,</HI> in consideration of his being <HI>unbeneficed,</HI> and reflecting how hard the present dearness of provisions, and the <HI>late Tax</HI> upon PORTER, must bear upon the Reverend Bard, most heartily gives his consent to be abused by him <HI>"Body, Soul, and Muse,"</HI> as often as thirst or
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>hunger shall prompt his genius: and should he be told hereafter, that the author of unpoetic libels is not hurt in his preferment, but that "to one bishop, <HI>Churchill</HI> seems a wit," he promises him to repine less at his success, though provoked, than Mr. <HI>Churchill</HI> and his little faction seem, unprovoked, to have done at Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI>'s.</P>

<P><HI>P.

Now the rich stream of Nusance, foul and strong,</L>

<L>While you perform'd, thro' all the mire,</L>
<L>The orgies of your sooty quire;</L>
<L>Then sitting on the swampy bank,</L>
<L>With sable ooze your tresses dank,</L>

<L>When at his well-known voice your ev'ry head</L>
<L>Above the filth you rais'd, and at the sight</L>
<L>Of the dear Bard with frantic cries</L>
<L>Of hideous joy the realms of light</L>
<L>You pierc'd, then headlong from the skies</L>
<L>(As <HI>Arethusa</HI> her son sprung from Gods)</L>
<L>You led him flound'ring to your drear abodes.</L>
<L>From hollow cells he heard the adders hiss,</L>
<L>As first he enter'd on this world of p—.</L>
<L>No water there from limpid sources springs,</L>
<L>To chafe his head no nymph the towel brings.</L>
<L>Far other rites your sisterhood employ,</L>
<L>Far other orgies of obscener joy.</L>
<L>With ordure fresh his body one anoints,</L>

<L>Another stradling o'er his head, with grace</L>
<L>Lets fly the briny torrent in his face;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="17"/>
The briny torrent down his temples ran;</L>

<L>Then rowl'd his eyes, and star'd tremendous wit;</L>
<L>Though to mere mortals but a priest b—.</L>
<L>Then bow'd his uncouth form and smil'd,</L>
<L>And with soft prate the hours beguil'd;</L>
<L>With wonder ey'd the secret store</L>
<L>Of Inf'rence sly, and quaint conceit</L>
<L>Like embryos on the swampy floor</L>

<L>Of yellow-tinctur'd ROSCIAD many a load;</L>
<L>Much <HI>Gazetteer,</HI> much <HI>Craftsman</HI> struck his view,</L>
<L>Much of himself, and much of <HI>Shirley</HI> too!</L>
<L>He saw where scandal's streams arise,</L>
<L>And wind their urinary course along</L>
<L>From Grubstreet bards; the fount of lies!</L>
<L>Scanty at first, but swelling strong</L>
<L>From tributary urns;</L>
<L>Joy o'er his visage burns,</L>
<L>As a view around he takes</L>

As <HI>Defamation</HI> pours and stinks along,</L>

<L>Joy fills his soul; joy sheds a mellower grace</L>
<L>O'er the brown horrors of his walnut face;</L>
<L>Of ev'ry stream he quaffs deep drafts immense,</L>
<L>And drinks oblivion of all truth and sense;</L>
<L>Intoxicates his brains, until in fuming rills</L>
<L>At <HI>Flexney</HI>'s door he all again distils.</L>
<L>But ah! ye Naiads, now your reign is o'er,</L>
<L>And now your <HI>Unborn Bard</HI> no more</L>
<L>To your beloved haunts shall go,</L>
<L>And woo his loves impure in grots of mud below;</L>
<L>No more seek inspiration at your shrine,</L>
<L>But all alone, unheard, unknown he'll pine!</L>
<L>Mirth shall no more revisit those dim eyes,</L>
<L>Unless he hear when patient Merit sighs;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="19"/>
But Merit still shall hold her steady flight,</L>
<L>Though Malice all her deadliest shafts should aim;</L>
<L>Though clouds oft interpose shall rise to light,</L>
<L>And soar on wings, which her own hands have form'd, to Fame.</L>
