<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MR. WROUGHTON.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>FAR from the haunts of men, of vice the foe,</L>
<L>The moon-struck child of genius and of woe,</L>
<L>Versed in each magic spell, and dear to fame,</L>
<L>A fair enchantress dwells, Romance her name.</L>
<L>She loathes the sun, or blazing taper's light:</L>
<L>The moon-beam'd landscape and tempestuous night</L>
<L>Alone she loves; and oft, with glimmering lamp,</L>
<L>Near graves new-open'd, or 'midst dungeons damp,</L>
<L>Drear forests, ruin'd aisles, and haunted towers,</L>
<L>Forlorn she roves, and raves away the hours!</L>
<L>Anon, when storms howl loud and lash the deep,</L>
<L>Desperate she climbs the sea-rock's beetling steep;</L>
<L>There wildly strikes her harp's fantastic strings,</L>
<L>Tells to the moon how grief her bosom wrings,</L>
<L>And while her strange song chaunts fictitious ills,</L>
<L>In wounded hearts Oblivion's balm distills.</L>
<L>A youth, who yet has lived enough to know</L>
<L>That life has thorns, and taste the cup of woe,</L>
<L>As late near Conway's time-bowed towers he stray'd,</L>
<L>Invok'd this bright enthusiasts magic aid.</L>
<L>His prayer was heard. With arms and bosom bare,</L>
<L>Eyes flashing fire, loose robes, and streaming hair,</L>
<L>Her heart all anguish, and her soul all flame,</L>
<L>Swift as her thoughts, the lovely maniac came!</L>
<L>High heav'd her breasts, which struggling passions rent,</L>
<L>As prest to give some fear-fraught mystery vent:</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>And oft, with anxious glance and alter'd face,</L>
<L>Trembling with terror, she relaxed her pace,</L>
<L>And stopt! and listened!—Then with hurried tread</L>
<L>Onwards again she rush'd, yet backwards bent her head,</L>
<L>As if from murderous swords or following fiends she fled!</L>
<L>Soon as near Conway's walls her footsteps drew,</L>
<L>She bade the youth their ancient state renew:</L>
<L>Eager he sped the fallen towers to rear:</L>
<L>'Twas done, and fancy bore the fabric here.</L>
<L>Next choosing from great Shakspeare's comic school,</L>
<L>The gossip crone, gross friar, and gibing fool—</L>
<L>These, with a virgin fair and lover brave,</L>
<L>To our young author's care the enchantress gave;</L>
<L>But charged him, ere he bless'd the brave and fair,</L>
<L>To lay th' exulting villain's bosom bare,</L>
<L>And by the torments of his conscience show,</L>
<L>That prosperous vice is but triumphant woe!</L>
<L>The pleasing task, congenial to his soul,</L>
<L>Oft from his own sad thoughts our author stole:</L>
<L>Blest be his labours, if with like success</L>
<L>They soothe their sorrows whom I now address.</L>
<L>Beneath this dome, should some afflicted breast</L>
<L>Mourn slighted talents, or desert opprest,</L>
<L>False friendship, hopeless love, or faith betray'd;</L>
<L>Our author will esteem each toil o'er-paid,</L>
<L>If, while his muse exerts her livelier vein,</L>
<L>Or tells imagined woes in plaintive strain,</L>
<L>Her flights and fancies make one smile appear</L>
<L>On the pale cheek, where trickled late a tear;</L>
<L>Or if <HI>her</HI> fabled sorrows steal one groan,</L>
<L>Which else her hearers would have given their own.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MRS. JORDAN.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>OSMOND by this arrived at Charon's ferry,</L>
<L>My honour saved, and dad alive and merry,</L>
<L>Hither I come the public doom to know,</L>
<L>But come not uncompell'd—the more's my woe!</L>
<L>E'en now, (oh! pity, friends, my hard mishap!)</L>
<L>My shoulder felt a Bow-Street runner's tap,</L>
<L>Who, while I shook with fear in every limb,</L>
<L>Thus spoke, with accent stern and visage grim—</L>
<L>"Mistress!" quoth he, "to me it given in trust is,</L>
<L>"To bring you straight before our larned Justice;</L>
<L>"For, know, 'tis said, to-night, the whole town o'er,</L>
<L>"You've kill'd one Osmond, alias Barrymore."</L>
<L>"The fellow's mad!" 'twas thus amaz'd I spoke;</L>
<L>"Lord! Sir, I murdered Osmond for a joke.</L>
<L>"This dagger, free from blood, will make it certain,</L>
<L>"He died but till the prompter dropped the curtain;</L>
<L>"And now, well pleased to quit this scene of riot,</L>
<L>"The man's gone home to sup in peace and quiet!"</L>
<L>Finding that all I said was said in vain,</L>
<L>And Townshend still his first design maintain,</L>
<L>I thought 'twere best to fly for shelter here,</L>
<L>And beg my generous friends to interfere.</L>
<L>But though the awkward nature of my case</L>
<L>May spread some slight confusion o'er my face,</L>
<L>No terrors awe my bosom, I'll assure ye;</L>
<L>Just is my cause, and English is my jury!</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>Besides, it must appear, on explanation,</L>
<L>How very ticklish was my situation,</L>
<L>And all perforce, his crimes when I relate,</L>
<L>Must own that Osmond well deserved his fate.</L>
<L>He heeded not papa's pathetic pleading;</L>
<L>He stabbed mama—which was extreme ill-breeding;</L>
<L>And at his feet for mercy when <HI>I</HI> sued,</L>
<L>The odious wretch, I vow, was downright rude.</L>
<L>Twice his bold hands my person dared to touch!</L>
<L>Twice in one day!—'Twas really once too much!</L>
<L>And therefore justly filled with virtuous ire,</L>
<L>To save my honour, and protect my fire,</L>
<L>I drew my knife, and in his bosom stuck it;</L>
<L>He fell, you clapped—and then he kicked the bucket!</L>
<L>So perish still the wretch, whose soul can know</L>
<L>Selfish delight, while causing other's woe;</L>
<L>Who blasts that joy, the sweetest God has given,</L>
<L>And makes an hell, where love would make an heaven!</L>
<L>Forbear, thou lawless libertine! nor seek</L>
<L>Forc'd favours on that pale averted cheek:</L>
<L>If thy warm kisses cost bright eyes one tear,</L>
<L>Kisses from loveliest lips are bought too dear—</L>
<L>Unless those lips with thine keep playful measure,</L>
<L>And that sweet tear should be a tear of pleasure!</L>
<L>Now as for Osmond—at that villain's name</L>
<L>I feel reviving wrath my soul inflame!</L>
<L>And shall one short and sudden pang suffice</L>
<L>To clear so base a fault, so gross a vice?</L>
<L>No! To your bar, dear friends, for aid I fly!</L>
<L>Bid Osmond live again, again to die;</L>
<L>Nightly with plaudits loud his breath recall,</L>
<L>Nightly beneath my dagger see him fall,</L>
<L>Give him a thousand lives!—and let <HI>me</HI> take them all.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Father PHILIP <HI>and</HI> MOTLEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>NEVER tell me!—I repeat it, you are a fellow of a very scandalous course of life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I repeat it, I'm a perfect image of the purest virtue, compared to whom, for sobriety and continence, Cato was a drunkard, and Lucretia little better than she should be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! hardened in impudence!—Can you deny being a pilferer, a lyar, a glutton—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I?—Heaven be thanked, I've courage enough to deny any thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doesn't all the world cry out upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly my transcendant merit has procured me some enemies, and, in common with many other great men, my virtue at present labours under something of a cloud. But understand me right, Father: Though I don't assent to the sum-total
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
of your accusations, possibly I may acknow∣ledge some of the items; the best actions frequently appear culpable, merely because their motives are unexplained. Therefore produce your charges, let me justify my conduct, and I doubt not I shall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immacu∣late and pure as a new sheet of foolscap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To begin then with your pilfering— Did you, or did you not, break open the pantry-door, and steal out the great goose-pye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begging your pardon, Father, that was no fault of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whose then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cook's undoubtedly; for if he hadn't locked the pantry-door, 'tis an hundred to one I shouldn't have taken the trouble to break it open.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nonsense! Nonsense!—I tell you, you've been guilty of stealing, which is a monstrous crime! And what did you steal? Had you taken any thing else I might have forgiven you: but to lay irreverent hands upon the goose-pye!—As I'm a Christian, the identical goose-pye which I in∣tended for my own supper!—But this is not my only objection to your conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What principally offends me is, that you pervert the minds of the maids, and keep kiss∣ing and smuggling all the pretty girls you meet. Oh! fye! fye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I kiss and smuggle them? St. Francis forbid! Lord love you, Father, 'tis they who kiss and smuggle me. I protest I do what I can to preserve my modesty; and I wish that Archbishop Dunstan had heard the lecture upon chastity which I read last night to the dairy-maid in the dark!
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking signify? The eloquence of my lips is coun∣teracted by the lustre of my eyes; and really the little devils are so tender, and so troublesome, that I'm half angry with nature for having made me so very bewitching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nonsense! Nonsense!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was but yesterday that Cicely and Luce went to fifty-cuffs, quarrelling which looked neatest—my red leg, or my yellow one. Then they are so fond and so coaxing! They hang about one so lovingly! And one says, "Kind Mr. Mot∣ley!" and t' other, "Sweet Mr. Motley!"—Ah! Father Philip! Father Philip! How is a poor little bit of flesh and blood, like me, to resist such temp∣tation?—Put yourself in my place: Suppose that a sweet smiling rogue, just sixteen, with rosy cheeks, sparkling eyes, pouting lips, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! fye! fye! fye!—To hear such licentious discourse brings the tears into my eyes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you, Father; for I see the wa∣ter is running over at your mouth. However, this shews you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shews me that you are a reprobate, and that my advice is thrown away upon you: In future I shall keep those counsels to myself, which I offered you from motives of pure Christian cha∣rity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charity, my good Father, should always begin at home: Now, instead of giving yourself so much trouble to mend me, what if you thought a little of correcting yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I?—I have nothing to correct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The odour of my sanctity perfumes the whole kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has a powerful smell about it, I own, not unlike carrion; you may wind it a mile off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>All malice!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not exactly: I could mention some little points which might be altered in you still better than in myself; such as intemperance, gluttony—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gluttony?—Oh! abominable false∣hood!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plain matter of fact!—Why will any man pretend to say that you came honestly by that enormous belly, that tremendous tomb of fish, flesh, and fowl? I protest I'm grateful to Heaven that among the unclean Beasts who accompanied Noah, there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks: they must infallibly have created a fa∣mine, and then the world would never have been re-peopled.—Next, for incontinence, you must al∣low yourself that you are unequalled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I? I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, you.—May I ask what was your business in the beech-grove the other evening, when I caught you with buxom Margery the mil∣ler's pretty wife? Was it quite necessary to lay your heads together so close?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly necessary: I was whispering in her ear wholsome advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed? Faith then she took your advice as kindly as it was given, and exactly in the same way too: you gave it with your lips, and she took it with hers!—Well done, Father Philip!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Son, Son, you give your tongue too great a licence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Father, be not angry: Fools, you know, are privileged persons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they are very useless ones; and in short, Master Motley, to be plain with you, of
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
all fools I think you the worst; and for fools of all kinds I've an insuperable aversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really? Then you have one good qua∣lity at least, and I cannot but admire such a total want of self-love! <STAGE>An horn sounds.</STAGE> But hark! 'tis the dinner-horn. Away to table, Father—Depend upon't, the servants will rather eat part of their din∣ner unblessed, than stay till your stomach comes like Jonas's whale, and swallows up the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, fool, I am going: but first let me explain to you, that my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite. No, son, no: Little sustenance do I take; but St. Cuth∣bert's blessing is upon me, and that little prospers with me most marvellously. Verily, the Saint has given me rather too plentiful an increase, and my legs are scarce able to support the weight of his bounties. <STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Alone.</STAGE> He looks like an over grown turtle, waddling upon its hind fins!—Yet at bot∣tom 'tis a good fellow enough, warm-hearted, be∣nevolent, friendly, and sincere; but no more in∣tended by nature to be a monk, than I to be a maid of honour to the queen of Sheba. <STAGE>Going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> PERCY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be mistaken: in spite of his dress, his features are too well known to me! Hist! Gilbert! Gilbert!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gilbert? Oh Lord, that's I!—Who calls?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you forgotten me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, sir, that would be no easy mat∣ter; I never forgot in my life what I never knew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have ten years altered me so much, that you cannot—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey!— Can it be— Pardon, my dear master, pardon!—In truth, you may well forgive my having forgotten <HI>your</HI> name, for at first I didn't very well remember my own. However, to prevent further mistakes, I must inform you, that he who in your father's service was Gilbert the knave, is Motley the fool in the service of Earl Osmond.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of Earl Osmond? This is fortunate. Gilbert, you may be of use to me; and if the at∣tachment which as a boy you professed for me still exists—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does with ardour unabated, for I'm not so unjust as to attribute to you my expulsion from Alnwic Castle: in fact I deserved it, for I cannot deny but that at twenty I was as good-for-nothing a knave as ever existed; consequently old Earl Percy dismissed me from his service, but I know that it was sorely against your inclination. You were then scarce fourteen, and I had been your companion and play-fellow from your child∣hood. I remember well your grief at parting with me, and that you slipped into my hand the purse which contained the whole of your little treasure. That act of kindness struck to my heart: I swore at the moment to love you through life, and it ever I forget my oath, damn me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My honest Gilbert!—And what made you assume this habit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my Lord! what could I do?—In spite of my knavery and tricks I was constantly upon the point of starving, and having once con∣tracted an idle habit of eating, I never could bring myself to leave it off. After living five years by my wits, want drove me almost out of them: I knew not what course to take, when I heard that
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
Earl Osmond's jester had fled the country. I ex∣erted my knavery for the last time in stealing the fugitive's cast coat, was accepted in his place by the Earl, and now gain an honest livelihood by persuading my neighbours that I'm a greater fool than themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your change is for the better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infinitely; indeed your fool is univer∣sally preferred to your knave—and for this reason; your fool is cheated, your knave cheats: Now every-body had rather cheat, than be cheated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some truth in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, sir, may I ask, what brings you to Wales?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A woman, whom I adore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I guessed that the business was about a petticoat. And this woman is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The orphan ward of a villager, with∣out friends, without family, without fortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great points in her favour, I must con∣fess. And which of these excellent qualities won your heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I had better reasons for bestow∣ing it on her. No, Gilbert; I loved her for a per∣son beautiful without art, and graceful without affectation—for an heart tender without weakness, and noble without pride. I saw her at once be∣loved and reverenced by her village companions: they looked on her as a being of a superior order; and I felt, that she who gave such dignity to the cottage-maid, must needs add new lustre to the coronet of the Percies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>From which I am to understand that you mean to marry this rustic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I mean otherwise, I should blush for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet surely the baseness of her origin—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can to me be no objection: in giving her my hand I raise her to my station, not debase myself to hers; nor ever, while gazing on the beauty of a rose, did I think it less fair because planted by a peasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo!—And what says your good grumbling father to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! he has long slept in the grave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he's quiet at last! Well, God grant him that peace in heaven, which he suffered, nobody to enjoy on earth!—But, his death having left you master of your actions, what obstacle now prevents your marriage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear.—Fearful lest my rank should influence this lovely girl's affections, and induce her to bestow her hand on the noble, while she refused her heart to the man, I assumed a pea∣sant's habit, and presented myself as Edwy the low-born and the poor. In this character I gained her heart, and resolved to hail, as Countess of Northumberland, the betrothed of Edwy the low-born and the poor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant the pretty soul wasn't dis∣pleased with the discovery!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That discovery is still unmade. Judge how great must have been my disappointment, when, on entering her guardian's cottage with this design, he informed me, that the unknown, who sixteen years before had confided her to his care, had reclaimed her on that very morning, and con∣veyed her no one knew whither.</P>

<P>True; and being your wife, if a stranger then had conveyed her no one knew whither, you might have thought yourself mightily obliged to him.</P>

<P>However, in spite of his precautions, I have traced the stranger's course, and find him to be Kenric, a dependent upon Earl Osmond.</P>
</SP>

<P>Surely 'tis not Lady Angela, who—</P>

<P>The very same! Speak, my good fel∣low! do you know her?</P>
</SP>

<P>Not by your description; for here she's understood to be the daughter of Sir Malcolm Mowbray, my master's deceased friend. And what is your present intention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To demand her of the Earl in mar∣riage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh!—that will never do:—for in the first place you'll not be able to get a sight of him. I've now lived with him five long years, and, till Angela's arrival, never witnessed a guest in the Castle.—Oh! 'tis the most melancholy mansion! And as to its master, he's the very antidote to mirth: He always walks with his arms folded, his brows bent, his eyes louring on you with a gloomy scowl: He never smiles; and to laugh in his presence would be high treason. He looks at no one—speaks to no one. None dare ap∣proach him, except Kenric and his four blacks— all others are ordered to avoid him; and when∣ever he quits his room, ding! dong! goes a great bell, and away run the servants like so many scared rabbits.</P>

know there's an ugly story respecting the last owners of this Castle—Osmond's brother, his wife, and infant child, were murdered by banditti, as it was said: unluckily the only servant who escaped the slaughter, deposed, that he recognised among the assassins a black still in the service of Earl Os∣mond. The truth of this assertion was never known, for the servant was found dead in his bed the next morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heavens!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since that time no sound of joy has been heard in Conway Castle. Osmond instantly be∣came gloomy and ferocious; he now never utters a sound except a sigh, has broken every tye of society, and keeps his gates barred unceasingly against the stranger.</P>

<P>My search has been fruitless. In vain have I paced the river's banks, and pierced the grove's deepest recesses. Nor glen nor thicket have I passed unexplored, yet found no stranger to whom Kenric's description could apply.</P>

by such wealth and power, dangerous would be her claim to these domains should her birth be discovered. Of this our Lord is aware; nor did he sooner hear that Northumberland loved her, than he hastened to remove her from Allan's care. At first I doubt his purpose was a foul one: her resemblance to her mother induced him to change it. He now is resolved to make her his bride, and restore to her those rights of which himself deprived her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAIB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think you the Lady perceives that our Master loves her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know she does not. Absorbed in her own passion for Percy, on Osmond's she bestows no thought, and, while roving through these pompous halls and chambers, sighs for the Che∣viot Hills, and Allan's humble cottage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAIB.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as she still believes Percy to be a low-born swain, when Osmond lays his coronet at her feet, will she reject his rank and splen∣dour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she loves well, she will. Saib, I too have loved! I have known how painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung; how inca∣pable was all else to supply her loss! I have ex∣changed want for plenty, fatigue for rest, a wretch∣ed hut for a splendid palace. But am I happier? Oh! no! Still do I regret my native land, and the partners of my poverty.

it, insults have made it hard! I have been drag∣ged from my native land, from a wife who was every thing to me, to whom I was every thing! Twenty years have elapsed since these Christians tore me away: they trampled upon my heart, mocked my despair, and, when in frantic terms I raved of Samba, laughed, and wondered how a negro's soul could feel! In that moment when the last point of Africa faded from my view, when as I stood on the vessel's deck I felt that all I loved was to me lost for ever, in that bitter mo∣ment did I banish humanity from my breast. I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair, I gave to the sea the precious token, and, while the high waves swift bore it from me, vowed aloud endless hatred to mankind. I have kept my oath, I <HI>will</HI> keep it!</P>

<P>Saib, the Earl's ingratitude cuts me to the heart! Attached to him from his infancy, I have long been his friend, long fancied him mine. The illusion is now over.

<P>Why, then, they to say, that the cham∣ber in which you sleep is haunted. You may have observed two folding-doors, which are ever kept locked: they lead to the Oratory, in which the Lady Evelina passed most of her time, while my Lord was engaged in the Scottish wars. She would fit there, good soul! hour after hour, playing on the lute, and singing airs so sweet, so sad, that many a time and oft have I wept to hear her. Ah! when I kissed her hand at the Castle-gate, little did I sus∣pect that her fate would have been so wretched!</P>

<P>And what was her fate?</P>

<P>A sad one, Lady! Impatient to embrace her Lord, after a year's absence, the Countess set out to meet him on his return from Scotland, ac∣companied by a few domestics and her infant-daughter, then scarce a twelvemonth old. But, as she returned with her husband, robbers surprised the party scarce a mile from the Castle; and since that time no news has been received of the Earl, of the Countess, the servants, or the child.</P>

<P>Speak lower, Lady! It was said so, I own: but for my own part I never believed it.

Nay, 'tis certain that he proposed to her before marriage, and would have made her his wife, only that she liked his brother better. Well she might indeed, for Earl Reginald was a sweeter gentleman by half.</P>

<P>And now be good enough to explain what purpose this masquerade is to answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly. You are to know, that since the late Earl's death the Castle is thought to be haunted: the servants are fully persuaded that his ghost wanders every night through the long galle∣ries, and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy mansion. He is supposed to be drest in compleat armour; and that which you wear at present was formerly his. Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a confe∣rence with Lady Angela; even now I heard her summoned to attend him in the Armoury. Placed upon this pedestal you may listen to their discourse unobserved, and thus form a proper judgment both of your mistress and her guardian. As soon as it grows dark I will conduct you to Angela's apart∣ments: the obscurity will then shelter you from discovery; and even should you be observed, you will pass for Earl Reginald's spectre.</P>

<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Heaven forbid! Not a word of it. Had I minded all the strange things related of this Castle, I should have died of fright in the first half-hour. Why, they say that Earl Hubert rides every night round the Castle on a white horse; that the ghost of Lady Bertha haunts the west pinnacle of the Chapel-Tower; and that Lord Hildebrand, who was condemned for treason some sixty years ago, may be seen in the Great Hall, regularly at midnight, playing at foot-ball with his own head! Above all, they say that the spirit of the late Countess sits nightly in her Oratory, and sings her baby to sleep! However, if it be so— <STAGE>A bell sounds thrice, loud and solemn</STAGE>—Hark! 'tis the Earl!—Quick to your post!— <STAGE>Percy <HI>ascends the pedestal</HI></STAGE>—Farewell! I must get out of his way; but as soon as he quits this chamber I'll re∣join you.</P>

<P>I will not sacrifice my happiness to hers! For sixteen long years have I thirsted; and now when the cup of joy again stands full before me, shall I dash it from my lip? No, Angela, you ask of me too much.

to my soul, save Angela's, save only Angela's! Doting upon one whom death has long clasped in his arms; tortured by desires which I never hoped to satisfy, many a mournful year has my heart known no throb but of anguish, no guest but remorse at committing a fruitless crime. Hope, that stranger, once more revisits my bosom: the fiend, who led me through passion's mazes to the heights of guilt, owns that a crime so great well merits a reward. He bids the monument's jaws unclose: Evelina revives in her daughter, and soon shall the fires which consume me be quenched in Angela's arms. What though her heart be Percy's? What though she prefer a basilisk's kiss to mine? Be∣cause my short-lived joy may cause her eternal sor∣row, shall I reject those pleasures sought so long, desired so earnestly? That will I not, by Heaven! Mine she is, and mine she shall be, though Regi∣nald's bleeding ghost flit before me, and thunder in my ear—"Hold! Hold!"—Peace, stormy heart! She comes!</P>

hear those scenes where I passed the blessed period of infancy; I still thirst for those simple pleasures which habit has made to me most dear. The birds which my own hands reared, and the flowers which my own hands planted; the banks on which I rest∣ed when fatigued, the wild tangled wood which supplied me with strawberries, and the village church where I prayed to be virtuous, while I yet knew of vice and virtue but the name, all have ac∣quired rights to my memory and my love!</P>

At morn when I left my bed, light were my spirits, and gay as the zephyrs of summer; and when at night my head again pressed my pillow, I whispered to myself, "Happy has been to-day, and to-mor∣row will be as happy!"

Edwy has my plighted faith: He received it on the last evening which I passed in Northumberland, as we sat on a low bench before old Allan's cottage. It was an heavenly night, sweet and tranquil as the loves of angels: A gentle breeze whispered among the honeysuckles which bloomed above us, and the full moon tinged with her silver light the distant towers of Alnwic. It was then that for the first time I gave him my hand, and I swore that I never would give it but to him! It was then that for the first time he pressed his lips to mine, and I swore that my lips should never be pressed by another!</P>

Without minding me any more than if I had been a dog or a cat—she pushed me on one side; and before I could recover my balance, somebody else, who came bouncing by me, gave me t'other thump—and there I lay sprawling upon the floor.

<P>Ah! She was more to me! She was my all, Edric, my all!—How could I bear my home when it no longer was the home of Angela? How could I rest in my cottage at night when her sweet lips had not kissed me—and murmured, "Father, sleep well!"—She is so good! so gen∣tle!—I was sick once, sick almost to death! An∣gela was then my nurse and comforter: She watched me when I slept, and cheered me when I woke: She rejoiced when I grew better; and when I grew worse, no medicine gave me ease like the tears of pity which fell on my burning cheeks from the eyes of my darling!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDRIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tears of pity indeed! A little rhubarb would have done you more good by half.—But our people stay a long time: Perhaps Motley has been discovered and seized; if so, he will lose his life, the Earl his freedom, Angela her lover, and,

<P>She is well, my old friend, and I have spoken to her—though but for a moment.

<P>Die with pleasure, you silly old man! you shall do nothing so ridiculous: You shall live a great many years; and, instead of lying down in your grave, we'll tuck you up warm with your old wife in the best down-bed of Alnwic Castle.—But now let us talk of our affairs, which, if I mistake not, are in the high road to success.</P>

<P>Listen.—"I have recognised you in spite of your disguise, and seize the opportunity to advise your exerting yourself solely to obtain Earl Percy's liberty.

When, bewildered by hatred of Reginald, and grief for Evelina's loss, my dagger was placed on the throat of their infant, your hand arrested the blow—Judge then how grateful I must feel when I behold in Angela her mother's living counterpart—behold her such as when, shielding with her body her fallen husband, Evelina received that dagger in her breast which I aimed at the heart of Reginald!—Worthy Kenric, how can I repay your services!</P>

<P>These you may easily.—But what, Earl Osmond, what can repay me for the sacrifice of my innocence?—I was virtuous till you bade me be guilty—my hands were pure till you taught me to stain them with blood—you painted in strong colours the shame of servitude—you promised free∣dom, riches, independence—you vanquished the

While I still believed him the peasant Edwy, often, in his hearing, have I dwelt upon Northumberland's praise, and chid him that he spoke of our Lord so coldly! Ah! little did I think that the man then seated beside me was he whom I envied for his power of doing good, whom I loved for exerting that power so largely!—Judge then, Earl Osmond, on my arrival here how strongly I must have felt the contrast!—What peasant names you his benefactor? What beggar has been com∣forted by your bounty? what sick man preserved by your care?—Your breast is unmoved by woe, your ear is deaf to complaint, your doors are barred against the poor and wretched.

<P>Father, on the word of a virgin, I saw him this very evening in Lady Angela's bed!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Lady Angela's?—On my con∣science, the devil has an excellent taste! But, Alice!—Alice!—how dare you trot about the house at this time of night, propagating such abo∣minable falsehoods?—One comfort is, that nobody will believe you. Lady Angela's virtue is too well known, and I'm persuaded she woudn't suf∣fer the devil to put a single claw into her bed for the universe!</P>

<P>Oh!—Was she not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure: But you shall hear how it happened. We were in the Cedar-room toge∣ther; and while we were talking of this and that, Lady Angela suddenly gave a great scream. I looked round, and what should I see but a tall figure all in white extended upon the bed! At the same time I heard a voice, which I knew to be the Countess Evelina's, pronounce in an hol∣low tone — "Alice! — Alice! — Alice!"—three times. You may be certain that I was frightened enough. I instantly took to my heels; and just as I got without side of the door, I heard a loud clap of thunder, and the whole chamber shook as if tumbling into a thousand pieces!</P>

<P>Ods my life, Father, how can you tell any thing about it? Sure I should know best; for I was there, and you were not. I repeat it—I heard the voice as plain as I hear yours: Do yon think I've no ears?</P>

<SPEAKER>F. PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! far from it: I think you've un∣commonly good ones; for you not only hear what has been said, but what has not. Hark!—the clock strikes twelve:—'Tis late, and I'm sleepy, so shall bid you farewell for the present. As to this wonderful story of yours, Alice, I don't be∣lieve one word of it: I'll be sworn that the voice was no more like your Lady's than like mine; and that the devil was no more in the bed than I was. Therefore, take my advice, set your heart at
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
rest, and go quietly to your chamber, as I am now going to mine.—Good-night.</P>

<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good-night?—Surely you'll not have the heart to leave me in this terrible situation!— Suppose Satan should appear to me when I'm alone! —Sinner that I am, I should certainly die of the fright!—Good Father, you are a priest, and an holy man; your habit frightens the evil spirits, and they dare not come near you:—Oh! if you will but suffer me to pass the night in your com∣pany—</P>

<P>Was it for this that you still flattered my person, and declared that nothing became a man more than a big belly? — Was it for this that you strove to win my heart through the medium of my stomach; that you used to come languishing every day with some liquorish dish; and, while you squeezed my left-hand tenderly, placed a sack-posset in the right?—Heavens! how deep-laid were your plans of seduction!—But mark me, tempter: In vain has the soup been salted, the

<P>Your folly well deserved such a reward. Knowing the Earl's hasty nature, you should have shunned him till the first storm of passion was past, and circumstances had again made your ministry needful.

<P>Not for his virtues, but for his vices, Saib: Can there for me be a greater cause to love him? Am I not branded with scorn? Am I not marked out for dishonour? Was I not free, and am I not a slave? Was I not once beloved, and am I not now despised? What man, did I tender my service, would accept the negro's friend∣ship? What woman, did I talk of affection, would not turn from the negro with disgust? Yet, in my own dear land, my friendship was courted, my love was returned. I had parents, children, wife! — Bitter thought—in one moment all were lost to me! Can I remember this, and not hate these white men? Can I think how cruelly they have wronged me, and not rejoice when I see them suffer?—Attached to Osmond, say you? Saib, I hate him! Yet viewing him as an avenging Fiend sent hither to torment his fellows, it glads me that he fills his office so well! Oh!

The latter sprang solely from his elder brother, whose birth-right he coveted, whose superiority he envied. Yet his aversion burst not forth, till Evelina Neville, re∣jecting his hand, bestowed hers with her heart on Reginald.—Then did Osmond's passion over-leap all bounds. He resolved to assassinate his brother

when returning from the Scottish wars, carry off the Lady, and make himself master of her person by force.—This scheme he imparted to me: he flattered, threatened, promised, and I yielded to his seduction!</P>

With this intention he sought your retreat; but when in you he beheld Evelina's living image, he changed his bloody purpose. He caused me to reclaim you from Allan, and resolved, by making you his wife, to give himself a lawful claim to these possessions.</P>

<P>The monster! Now then I know, when

<P>IN truth, my Lord, you venture too near the Castle. Should you fall into Osmond's power a second time, your next jump may be into a better world.</P>

<P>With all my heart, but permit me to fear for myself. We are now within bow-shot of the Castle. The archers may think proper to amuse us with a proof of their skill; and were I to feel an arrow quivering in my gizzard, pro∣bably I should be much more surprised than
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
pleased. Good my Lord, let us back to the fisherman's hut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your advice may be wise, Gilbert, but I cannot follow it. Angela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s escape may be dis∣covered—she may be pursued, and in need of my assistance. Then counsel not my retiring; my fears of losing Angela are too strong, the flame which burns in my bosom too ardent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure no flame burning in your bosom can give you so much pain as an arrow would give me sticking in mine; and as to your fears of losing the Lady, I'd bet mine of losing my life against any fears in Christendom!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Gilbert? Have you not pro∣mised to stand by me to the last? Did you not say you could die in my service with pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.—But, Lord! if a man was always taken at his word, the world would soon be turned upside down. When a polite gentleman begs you to consider his house as your own, and assures you that all he has is at your disposal, he'd be in a terrible scrape if you began knocking down his walls, or requested the loan of his wife or daugh∣ters!—No, no, Sir!—When I said that I should die in your service with pleasure, I intended to live in it many long years; since, to tell you the truth, from a child I had always a particular dislike to dying, and I think that with every hour the pre∣judice grows stronger.—Good my Lord, let us be gone. Ere long I doubt not—</P>

<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! The flame in your bosom keeps you warm; and in a cold night love wraps one up better than a blanket <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sancho makes nearly the same observation upon sleep.</NOTE>. But that not being my situation, the present object of my de∣sires is a blazing wood-fire, and Venus would look to me less lovely than a smoking sack-posset!—Oh! when I was in love, I managed matters much bet∣ter: I always paid my addresses by the fire-side, and contrived to urge my soft suit just at dinner-time. Then how I filled my fair-one's ears with fine speeches, while she filled my trencher with roast-beef!—Then what figures and tropes came out of my mouth, and what dainties and tid-bits went in!—'Twould have done your heart good to hear me talk, and see me eat—and you'd have found it no easy matter to decide, whether I had most wit or appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who was the object of this vora∣cious passion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOTL.</SPEAKER>
<P>A person well calculated to charm both my heart and my stomach: It was a Lady of great merit, who did your Father the honour to superintend his culinary concerns. I was scarce fifteen, when she kindled a flame in my heart, while lighting the kitchen fire, and from that moment I thought on nothing but her. My mornings were passed in composing poems on her beauty, my evenings in reciting them in her ear; for Nature had equally denied the fair creature and myself the faculty of reading and writing.</P>

<P>You were successful, I hope?</P>

<P>Why, at length, my Lord, a Pin∣daric Ode upon her grace in frying pancakes melted her heart. She consented to be mine— when, oh! cruel Fortune! taking one night a drop too much—poor dear creature! she ne∣ver got the better of it!—I wept her loss, and composed an Elegy upon it, which has been thought, by many persons of great judgment, not totally destitute of taste and sublimity.

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>MANY erroneous assertions have been made respecting this Drama; some, that the language was originally extremely licentious; others, that the sentiments were violently demo∣cratic; and others again, that if Mr. Sheridan had not advised me to content myself with a single Spectre, I meant to have exhibited a whole regiment of Ghosts. To disprove these re∣ports I have deviated from the usual mode of publishing Plays, as performed, and have printed mine almost verbatim, as originally written. Whether it merited the above accusations, the reader has now had an opportunity of judging for himself. I must just mention that the last line of the Piece is altered, and that in the Second Scene of the Fifth Act, <HI>The Friar</HI> was made to stick in the door-way, whereas he now makes his exit without difficulty.</P>
<P>Other charges, however, have been brought against me on better grounds, and I must request the reader's patience while I say a few words respecting them. To originality of cha∣racter I make no pretence. Persecuted heroines and con∣science-stung villains certainly have made their courtesies and bows to a British audience long before the appearance of <HI>"The Castle Spectre;"</HI> the <HI>Friar</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> are copies, but very faint ones, from <HI>Juliet's Nurse,</HI> and Sheridan's <HI>Father Paul,</HI> and <HI>Percy</HI> is a mighty pretty-behaved young gentleman with nearly no character at all. I shall not so readily give up my claim to novelty, when I mention my misanthropic <HI>Negro:</HI> He has been compared to <HI>Zanga;</HI> but Young's Hero differs widely from what I meant in <HI>Hassan. Zanga</HI>'s hatred is con∣fined to one object; to destroy the happiness of that object is
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
his sole aim, and his vengeance is no sooner accomplished, than he repents its gratification. <HI>Hassan</HI> is a man of violent passions, and warm feelings, whose bosom is filled with the milk of human kindness, but that milk is soured by despair; whose nature was susceptible of the tenderest affections, but who feels that all the chains of his affections are broken for ever. He has lost every thing, even hope; he has no single object against which he can direct his vengeance, and he di∣rects it at large against mankind. He hates all the world, hates even himself; for he feels that in that world there is no one that loves him.</P>
<Q><L>Lorsque l'on peut souffrir, sure que ses douleurs</L>
<L>D'aucun mortel ne font jamais couler les pleurs,</L>
<L>On se desinteresse à la fin de soi-même;</L>
<L>On cesse de s'aimer, si quelqu'un ne nous aime!</L></Q>
<P>But though Hassan's heart is changed by disappointment and misfortune, that heart once was feeling and kind; nor could he hate with such inveteracy, if he had not loved with extreme affection. In my opinion this character is not <HI>Zanga's;</HI> but this I must leave to the public decision. I may, however, boldly, and without vanity, assert, that <HI>Motley</HI> is quite new to the Stage. In other plays the Fool has always been a sharp knave, quick in repartee, and full of whim, fancy, and entertainment; whereas <HI>my</HI> Fool (but I own I did not mean to make him so) is a dull, flat, good sort of plain matter of fact fellow, as in the course of the per∣formance Mr. Bannister discovered to his great sorrow.</P>
<P>That <HI>Osmond</HI> is attended by <HI>negroes</HI> is an anachronism, I allow; but from the great applause which Mr. Dowton con∣stantly received in <HI>Hassan</HI> (a character which he played ex∣tremely well), I am inclined to think that the audience was not greatly offended at the impropriety. For my own part, I by no means repent the introduction of my <HI>Africans:</HI> I

thought it would give a pleasing variety to the characters and dresses, if I made my servants black; and could I have pro∣duced the same effect by making my heroine blue, blue I should have made her.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Friar</HI>'s defence, when he most ungallantly leaves <HI>An∣gela</HI> in the cavern to shift for herself, I can only plead the ne∣cessity of the case. Stay where he was he could not; go he must at any rate: I trundled him off in the best way that I could; and, for the sake of the public, I heartily wish that way had been better. With regard to his not meeting <HI>Osmond</HI> in his flight, a little imagination will soon conquer that diffi∣culty: It may be supposed, that as he lost his way in coming, he lost it again in going; or, that he concealed himself till <HI>the Earl</HI> had passed him; or, that he tumbled down and broke his neck; or, that he....did any thing else you like better. I leave this matter entirely to the reader's fancy.</P>
<P>Against my <HI>Spectre</HI> many objections have been urged: one of them I think rather curious. She ought not to appear, because the belief in Ghosts no longer exists! In my opinion, this is the very reason why she <HI>may</HI> be produced without dan∣ger; for there is now no fear of increasing the influence of su∣perstition, or strengthening the prejudices of the weak-minded. I confess I cannot see any reason why Apparitions may not be as well permitted to stalk in a tragedy, as Fairies be suffered to fly in a pantomime, or Heathen Gods and Goddesses to cut capers in a grand ballet; and I should rather imagine that <HI>Oberon</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> now find as little credit to the full as the <HI>Cock-lane Ghost,</HI> or the Spectre of <HI>Mrs. Veal.</HI></P>
<P>Never was any poor soul so ill-used as <HI>Evelina</HI>'s, previous to her presenting herself before the audience. The Friends to whom I read my Drama, the Managers to whom I presented it, the Actors who were to perform in it—all combined to per∣secute my <HI>Spectre,</HI> and requested me to confine my Ghost to

the Green-Room. Aware that without her my catastrophe would closely resemble that of the <HI>Grecian Daughter,</HI> I per∣sisted in retaining her. The event justified my obstinacy: <HI>The Spectre</HI> was as well treated before the curtain as she had been ill-used behind it; and as she continues to make her ap∣pearance nightly with increased applause, I think myself un∣der great obligations both to her and her representative.</P>
<P>But though I am conscious that it is very imperfect, I shall not so far offend my own feelings, or insult the judgment of the public, which has given it a very favourable reception, as to say that I think my Play very bad. Had such been my opinion, instead of producing it on the stage, or committing it to the press, I should have put it behind the fire, or, throwing it into the <HI>Thames,</HI> made a present of it to the British <HI>Scombri.</HI> Still its success on the stage (great enough to content even an author) does not prevent my being very doubtful as to its reception in the closet, when divested of its beautiful music, splendid scenery, and, above all, of the acting, excellent throughout. Without detracting from the merits of the other performers (to all of whom I think myself much in∣debted for their respective exertions), I must here be per∣mitted to return particular thanks to Mrs. Jordan, whose manner of sustaining her character exceeded my most san∣guine hopes, and in whose hands my heroine acquired an im∣portance for which she was entirely indebted to the talents of the actress.</P>
