<L>To thee, kind Nymph, as to offended Heav'n,</L>
<L>I own my Faults, and sue to be forgiv'n;</L>

<L>Think not a rigid Judge your Faults arraigns,</L>
<L>My tender Bosom feels for all your Pains;</L>
<L>In those sad Hours, when to the secret Grove</L>
<L>I told my Pangs of inauspicious Love,</L>
<L>My only Pray'r was once again to see</L>
<L>The lovely Author of my Misery!</L>
<L>Again to clasp him to my beating Breast,</L>
<L>The Gods have heard my Vows, and <HI>Laura</HI>'s blest.</L>
