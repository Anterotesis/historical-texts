<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was first call'd to the Office of Historiographer to <HI>John Bull,</HI> he ex∣press'd himself to this purpose: <HI>Sir</HI> Humphry, <HI>I know you are a plain Dealer; it is for that Reason I have chosen you for this important Trust; speak the Truth, and spare not.</HI> That I might fulfil those his honourable In∣tentions, I obtain'd Leave to <HI>repair</HI> to, and at∣tend him in his most secret Retirements; and I put the Journals of all Transactions into a strong Box, to be open'd at a fitting Occasion, after the manner of the Historiographers of some Eastern Monarchs: This I thought was the safest way; tho' I declare I was never afraid to be <HI>chop'd</HI> by my Master for telling of Truth. It is from those Journals that my Memoirs are compil'd: There∣fore let not Posterity, a thousand Years hence, look for Truth in the voluminous Annals of Pedants, who are entirely ignorant of the secret Springs of great Actions; if they do, let me tell them, they will be <HI>Nebus'd.</HI> With incredible Pains have I endeavour'd to copy the several Beauties of the an∣cient
<PB REF="3"/>
and modern Historians; the impartial Tem∣per of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the Gravity, Austerity, and strict Morals of <HI>Thucidides,</HI> the extensive Know∣ledge of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> the Sublimity and Grandeur of <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> and to avoid the careless Stile of <HI>Polybius:</HI> I have borrow'd considerable Orna∣ments from <HI>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</HI> and <HI>Dio∣dorus Siculus:</HI> The <HI>specious Gilding</HI> of <HI>Taci∣tus</HI> I endeavour'd to shun. <HI>Mariana, Davila,</HI> and <HI>Fra. Paulo,</HI> are those amongst the Moderns whom I thought most worthy of Imitation; but I cannot be so disingenuous, as not to own the infi∣nite Obligations I have to the <HI>Pilgrim's Progress</HI> of <HI>John Bunyan,</HI> and the <HI>Tenter Belly</HI> of the Reverend <HI>Joseph Hall.</HI> From such Encourage∣ment and Helps, it is easy to guess to what a de∣gree of Perfection I might have brought this great Work, had it not been nip'd in the Bud by some illiterate People in both Houses of Parliament, who envying the great Figure I was to make in future Ages, under Pretence of raising Money for the War, have padlock'd all those very Pens that were to celebrato the Actions of their Heroes, by silencing at once the whole Ʋniversity of <HI>Grub∣street.</HI> I am perswaded, that nothing but the Prospect of an approaching Peace could have en∣courag'd them to make so bold a step. But suffer me, in the Name of the rest of the Matriculates of that famous Ʋniversity, to ask them some plain Questions: Do they think that Peace will bring along with it the Golden Age? Will there be ne∣ver a Dying-Speech of a Traitor? Are <HI>Cethegus</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
and <HI>Cataline</HI> turn'd so tame, that there will be no opportunity to cry about the Streets, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dan∣gerous Plot?</HI> Will Peace bring such Plenty, that no Gentleman will have occasion to go upon the Highway, or break into a House? I am sorry that the World should be so much impos'd upon by the Dreams of a <HI>False Prophet,</HI> as to imagine the <HI>Millennium</HI> is at hand. O <HI>Grubstreet!</HI> thou fruitful Nursery of tow'ring Genius's! how do I lament thy Downfall? Thy Ruin could never be meditated by any who means well to <HI>English</HI> Li∣berty: No modern <HI>Lycaeum</HI> will ever equal thy Glory, whether in soft Pasiorals, thou sung the Flames of pamper'd Apprentices and coy Cook-Maids, or mournful Ditties of departing Lovers; or if to <HI>Maeonian</HI> Sirains thou rais'd thy Voice, to record the Stratageies, the arduous Exploits, and the nocturnal Scalade of needy Heroes, the Terror of your peaceful Citizen, describing the powerful <HI>Betty,</HI> or the artful <HI>Picklock,</HI> or the secret Caverns and Grotto's of <HI>Vulcan</HI> sweat∣ing at his Forge, and slamping the Queens Image on viler Metals, which he retails for Beef, and Pots of Ale; or if thou wert content in simple Narrative to relate the cruel Acts of implacable Revenge, or the Complaints of ravish'd Virgins, blushing to tell their Adventure before the listen∣ing Crowd of City Damsels, whilst in thy faith∣ful History thou intermingles the gravest Coun∣sels and the purest Morals: Nor less acute and piercing wert thou in thy Search and pompous De∣scription of the Works of Nature, whether in pro∣per
<PB REF="5"/>
and emphatick Terms thou didst paint the blazing Comets fiery Tale, the stupendous Force of dreadful Thunder and Earthquakes, and the unrelenting Inundations. Sometimes, with <HI>Ma∣chiavelian</HI> Sagacity, thou unravellest the Intrigues of State, and the traiterous Conspiracies of Rebels giving wise Counsel to Monarchs. How didst thou move our Terror and our Pity with thy passionate Scenes, between <HI>Jack-catch</HI> and the He∣roes of the <HI>Old-Baily!</HI> How didst thou describe their intrepid March up <HI>Holborn-Hill!</HI> Nor didst thou shine less in thy theological Capacity, when thou gavest ghostly Counsel to dying Felons, and recorded the guilty Pangs of Sabbath-breakers! How will the noble Arts of <HI>John Overton'</HI>s Pain∣ting and Sculpture now languish! where rich In∣vention, proper Expression, correct Design, divine Altitudes, and artful Contrast, heighten'd with the Beauties of <HI>Clar-Obscur,</HI> embellish'd thy cele∣brated Pieces to the Delight and Astonishment of the judicious Multitude! Adieu persuasive Elo∣quence! the quaint Metaphor, the poinant Irony, the proper Epithet, and the lively Simile, are fled to <HI>Burleigh on the Hill:</HI> Instead of these, we shall have <HI>I know not what — <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Bp. of <HI>St. Asap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Preface.</NOTE> The Illiterate will tell the rest with Pleasure!</HI> I hope the Reader will excuse the Digression, due by way of Condolance to my worthy Brethren of <HI>Grub∣street,</HI> for the approaching Barbarity that is like∣ly to overspread all its Regions, by this oppressive and exorbitant Tax, It has been my good For∣tune
<PB REF="6"/>
to receive my Education there; and so long as I preserv'd some Figure and Rank amongst the Learned of that Society, I scorn'd to take my Degree either at <HI>Utrecht</HI> or <HI>Leyden,</HI> though I was offer'd it <HI>gratis</HI> by the Professors there.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Sequel of the History of the Meeting at the <HI>Salutation.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHere, I think, I left <HI>John Bull,</HI> sit∣ting between <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> and <HI>Lewis Baboon,</HI> with his Arms <HI>a-kimbo,</HI> in great Concern to keep <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Nic.</HI> asun∣der. As watchful as he was, <HI>Nic.</HI> found the Means, now and then, to stear a Whisper, and, by a cleanly Conveyance under the Ta∣ble, to slip a short Note into <HI>Lewis</HI>'s hand,
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
which <HI>Lewis</HI> as slyly put into <HI>John</HI>'s Pocket, with a Pinch or a Jog, to warn him what he was about. <HI>John</HI> had the Curiosity to retire into a Corner, to peruse these <HI>Billet deux</HI> of <HI>Nic</HI>'s; wherein he found, that <HI>Nic,</HI> had used great Freedoms, both with his Interest and Reputation. One contained these words, <HI>Dear</HI> Lewis, <HI>Thou seest clearly that this Block∣head can never bring his Matters to bear: Let thee and me talk to night by our selves at the</HI> Rose, <HI>and I'll give thee Satisfaction.</HI> Another was thus express'd; <HI>Friend</HI> Lewis, <HI>Has thy Sense quite forsaken thee, to make</HI> Bull <HI>such Of∣fers? Hold fast, part with nothing, and I will give thee a better Bargain, I'll warrant thee.</HI></P>
<P>In some of his Billets, he told <HI>Lewis</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>John Bull</HI> was under his Guardianship; that the best part of his Servants were at his Command; that he could have <HI>John</HI> gagg'd and bound whenever he pleased, by the People of his own Family."</Q> In all these Epistles, Blockhead, Dunce, Ass, Cox∣comb, were the best Epithets he gave poor <HI>John:</HI> In others he threatned, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that He, Esquire <HI>South,</HI> and the rest of the Trades∣men, would lay <HI>Lewis</HI> down upon his Back, beat out his Teeth, if he did not retire immediately, and break up the Meeting.</Q></P>
<P>I fancy I need not tell my Reader, that <HI>John</HI> often chang'd Colour as he read, and that his Fingers itch'd to give <HI>Nic.</HI> a good Slap on the Chops, but he wisely moderated
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
his cholerick Temper: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I sav'd this Fellow (quoth he) from the Gallows when he ran away from his last Master, because I thought he was harshly treated; but the Rogue was no fooner safe under my Protection, than he began to lie, pilfer, and steal, like the Devil: When I first set him up in a warm House, he had hardly put up his Sign, when he began to debauch my best Cu∣stomers from me: Then it was his con∣stant Practice to rob my Fish-ponds, not only to feed his Family, but to trade with the Fishmongers: I conniv'd at the Fellow till he began to tell me, that they were his as much as mine: In my Manour of <HI>Eastcheap,</HI> because it lay at some distance from my constant Inspection, he broke down my Fences, robb'd my Orchards, and beat my Servants. When I us'd to repri∣mand him for his Tricks, he would talk saucily, lye, and brazen it out, as if he had done nothing amiss. Will nothing cure thee of thy Pranks <HI>Nic.</HI> (quoth I?) I shall be forced, some time or another, to chastise thee: The Rogue got up his Cane and threatned me, and was well thwack'd for his Pains: But I think his Behaviour at this time worst of all; after I have al∣most drowned my self, to keep his Head above Water, he would leave me sticking in the Mud, trusting to his Goodness to help me out. After I have beggar'd my
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
self with his troublesome Law-Suit, with a Pox to him, he takes it in mighty Dud∣geon because I have brought him here to end Matters amicably, and because I won't let him make me over, by Deed and Inden∣ture, as his lawful Cully; which, to my certain Knowledge, he has attempted se∣veral times. But, after all, canst thou ga∣ther Grapes from Thorns? <HI>Nic.</HI> does not pretend to be a Gentleman, he is a Trades∣man, a self-seeking Wretch, but how ca∣mest thou to bear all this, <HI>John?</HI> The Rea∣son is plain; Thou conferrest the Benefits, and he receives them; the first produces Love, and the last Ingratitude: Ah! <HI>Nic. Nic.</HI> thou art a damn'd Dog, that's cer∣tain; thou knowest too well, that I will take care of thee, else thou would'st not use me thus: I won't give thee up, it is true; but as true as it is, thou shalt not sell me, according to thy laudable Custom.</Q>While <HI>John</HI> was deep in this Soliloquy, <HI>Nic.</HI> broke out into the following Protesta∣tion.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I believe every body here present will allow me to be a very just and disinte∣rested Person. My Friend <HI>John Bull</HI> here is very angry with me, forsooth, because I won't agree to his foolish Bargains. Now I declare to all Mankind, I should be ready
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
to sacrifice my own Concerns to his Quiet; but the care of his Interest, and that of the honest Tradesmen that are embark'd with us, keeps me from entring into this Com∣position. What shall become of those poor Creatures? The Thoughts of their impen∣ding Ruin disturbs my Night's Rest, there∣fore I desire they may speak for themselves. If they are willing to give up this Affair, I shan't make two words of it.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>John Bull</HI> begg'd him to lay aside that immoderate Concern for him; and withal, put him in mind, that the Interest of those Tradesmen had not sat quite so heavy upon him some Years ago, on a like Occasion. <HI>Nic.</HI> answer'd little to that, but immediately pull'd out a Boatswain's Whistle; upon the first Whiff, the Tradesmen came jumping into the Room, and began to surround <HI>Lewis</HI> like so many yelping Curs about a great Boar, or, to use a modester Simile, like Duns at a great Lord's Leve the Morning he goes into the Country; one pull'd him by the Sleeve, ano∣ther by the Skirt, a third hallow'd in his Ear; they began to ask him for all that had been taken from their Forefathers by Stealth, Fraud, Force, or lawful Purchase; some ask'd for Manours, others for Acres, that lay con∣venient for them; that he would pull down his Fences, level his Ditches; all agreed in one common Demand, that he should be
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
purg'd, sweated, vomited, and starv'd, till be came to a sizeable Bulk, like that of his Neighbours; one modestly ask'd him Leave to call him Brother; <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> demanded two Things, to be his Porter and his Fishmonger, to keep the Keys of his Gates, and furnish his Kitchen; <HI>John</HI>'s Sister <HI>Peg</HI> only desir'd that he would let his Servants sing Psalms a Sun∣days; some descended even to the asking of old Cloaths, Shoes, and Boots, broken Bottles, Tobacco-pipes, and Ends of Candles.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Bull</HI> (quoth <HI>Lewis</HI>) you seem to be a Man of some Breeding; for God's sake use your Interest with these Messicurs, that they wou'd speak but one at once; for if one had a hundred pair of Hands, and as many Tongues, he cannot satisfy them all at this rate. <HI>John</HI> begg'd they might proceed with some Method; then they stop'd all of a sud∣den, and would not say a word. If this be your Play (quoth <HI>John</HI>) that we may not be like a Quaker's dumb Meeting, let us begin some Diversion; what d'ye think of Rouly-Pouly, or a Country-Dance? What if we should have a Match at Football! I am sure we shall never end Matters at this rate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>John Bull</HI> and <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> settled their Accompts.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>DƲring this general Cessation of Talk, what if You and I <HI>Nic.</HI> should en∣quire how Money-matters stand between us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic. Frog.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, I love exact Dealing; and let <HI>Hocus</HI> Audit; he knows how the Money was disburs'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not much for that at present; we'll settle it between Ourselves: Fair and Square <HI>Nic.</HI> keeps Friends together. There have been laid out in this Law-Suit, at one time 36000 Pounds and 40000 Crowns: In some Cases I, in others you, bear the greatest proportion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right: I pay three Fifths of the greatest Number, and you pay two Thirds of the lesser Number: I think this is Fair and Square as you call it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two Thirds of 36000 Pounds are 24000 Pounds for your Share, and there remains 12000 for mine. Again, Of the 40000 Crowns I pay 24000, which is three Fifths, and you pay only 16000, which is two Fifths; 24000 Crowns make 6000 Pounds, and 16000 Crowns make 4000 Pounds: 12000 and 6000 make 18000: 24000 and 4000 makes 28000. So there are 18000 Pounds to my Share of the Expences, and 28000 to yours.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15"/>
After <HI>Nic.</HI> had bambouzled <HI>John</HI> a while about the 18000 and the 28000, <HI>John</HI> call'd for Counters; but what with Slight of Hand, and taking from his own Score and, adding to <HI>John</HI>'s, <HI>Nic.</HI> brought the Balance always on his own side.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, good Friend <HI>Nic.</HI> though I am not quite so nimble in the Fingers, I understand Cyphering as well as you: I will produce you my Accompts one by one, fairly writ out of my own Books: And here I be∣gin with the first. You must excuse me if I don't pronounce the Law Terms right.</P>

<P>As for your <HI>Venire facias,</HI> I have paid you for one already; in the other, I be∣lieve you will be Nonsuited: I'll take care of my Nephew my self. Your <HI>Coach-hire</HI> and Family Charges are most unreasonable Dedu∣ctions;
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
at that rate, I can bring in any Man in the World my Debtor. But who the Devil are those two <HI>Majors</HI> that consume all my Money? I find they always run away with the Ballance in all Accompts.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic. Frog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two very honest Gentlemen, I assure you, that have done me some Service.</P>
<P>To tell you plainly <HI>Major Ab.</HI> denotes thy greater Ability, and <HI>Major Will</HI> thy greater Willingness to carry on this Law-suit. It was but reasonable thou shouldst pay both for thy <HI>Power</HI> and thy <HI>Positiveness.</HI></P>

<P>Why all this Higgling with thy Friend about such a paltry Sum? Does this become the Generosity of the Noble and Rich <HI>John Bull?</HI> I wonder thou art not asham'd. Oh <HI>Hocus! Hocus!</HI> where art thou, it used to go another-guess manner in thy time, when a poor Man has almost undone himself for thy sake, thou art for fleecing him and fleecing him; is that thy Conscience <HI>John?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pleasant indeed; it is well known thou retains thy Lawyers by the Year, so a fresh Law-suit adds but little to thy Ex∣pence, they are thy Customers, I hardly ever sell them a Farthings worth of any thing; nay, thou hast set up an Eating-house, where the whole Tribe of them spend all they can rap or run; if it were well reckon'd, I believe
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
thou gets more of my Money than thou spends of thy own. However, if thou wilt needs plead Poverty, own at least that thy Ac∣compts are false.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nic. Frog.</SPEAKER>
<P>No marry won't I, I refer my self to these honest Gentlemen, let them judge between us; let Esquire <HI>South</HI> speak his Mind, whither my Accounts are not right, and whi∣ther we ought not to go on with our Law-suit.</P>

<P>Consult the Butchers about keep∣ing of <HI>Lent.</HI> I tell you once for all, <HI>John Bull</HI> knows where his Shoe pinches, none of your Esquires shall give him the Law, as long as he wears this trusty Weapon by his side, or has an inch of broad Cloath in his Shop.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic. Frog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there it is, you will be both Judge and Party; I am sorry thou disco∣verest so much of thy head-strong Humour before these strange Gentlemen, I have often told you that it would prove thy Ruin some time or another.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>John</HI> saw clearly he should have nothing but wrangling, and that he should have as little Success in settling his Accounts as ending the Composition: Since they will needs over∣load my Shoulders (quoth <HI>John</HI>) I shall throw down the Burden with a squash amongst them, take it up who dares; a Man has a fine time of it, amongst a combination of Sharpers, that Vouch for one anothers Honesty. <HI>John</HI> look to thy self, Old <HI>Lewis</HI> makes reasonable

Offers, when thou hast spent the small Pit∣tance that is left, thou wilt make a glorious Figure when thou art brought to live upon <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> and Esquire <HI>South</HI>'s Generosity and Gratitude, if they use thee thus, when they want thee, what will they do when thou wants them? I say again, <HI>John</HI> look to thy self?</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>John Bull</HI> found all his Family in an Ʋp∣roar at Home.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>NIc. Frog.</HI> who thought of nothing but carrying <HI>John</HI> to the Market, and there disposing of him as his own proper Goods, was mad to find that <HI>John</HI> thought himself now of Age to look afer his own Affairs: He resolv'd to traverse this
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
new Project, and to make him uneasie in his own Family. He had corrupted or de∣suded most of his Servants into the extrava∣gantest Conceits in the World, that their Ma∣ster was run mad, and wore a Dagger in one Pocket, and Poison in the other; that he had told his Wife and Children to <HI>Lewis,</HI> disin∣herited his Heir, and was going to settle his Estate upon a Parish Boy; that if they did not look after their Master, he would do some very mischievous Thing. When <HI>John</HI> came home he found a more surprising Scene than any he had yet met with, and that you will say was somewhat extraordinary.</P>
<P>He call'd his Cook-maid <HI>Betty</HI> to bespeak his Dinner, <HI>Betty</HI> told him, <HI>That she beg'd his Pardon; she could not dress Dinner till she knew what he intended to do with his Will.</HI> Why <HI>Betty,</HI> Forsooth (quoth <HI>John</HI>) thou art not run mad art thou? My Will at present is to have Din∣ner: That may be (quoth <HI>Betty</HI>) but my Con∣science won't allow me to dress it, till I know whither you intend to do righteous Things by your Heir? I am sorry for that <HI>Betty</HI> (quoth <HI>John</HI>) I must find some body else then. Then he call'd <HI>John</HI> the Barber. Before I begin (quoth <HI>John</HI>) I hope your Honour won't be offended, if I ask you whither you intend to after your Will? If you won't give me a po∣sitive Answer, your Beard may grow down to your Middle, for me. I gad and so it shall (quoth <HI>Bull</HI>) for I will never trust my Throat
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
in such a mad Fellows Hands. Where's <HI>Dick</HI> the Butler? Look ye (quoth <HI>Dick</HI>) I am very willing to serve you in my Calling, d'ye see, but there are strange Reports, and plain-deal∣ing is best, d'ye see. I must be satisfied if you intend to leave all to your Nephew, and if <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> is still your Executor, d'ye see; if you will not satisfie me as to these Points, d'ye see, you may drink with the Ducks: And so I will (quoth <HI>John</HI>) rather than keep a But∣ler that loves my Heir better than my self. <HI>Hob</HI> the Shoemaker, and <HI>Pricket</HI> the Taylor told him, they would most willingly serve him in their several Stations, if he would pro∣mise them never to talk with <HI>Lewis Baboon,</HI> and let <HI>Nicolas Frog,</HI> Linnen-draper, manage his Concerns; that they could neither make Shoes nor Cloaths to any that were not in good Correspondence with their worthy Friend <HI>Nicolas.</HI></P>

<P><HI>John</HI> began now to think that they were all enchanted; he enquires about the Age of the Moon, if <HI>Nic</HI> had not given them some intoxicating <HI>Potion,</HI> or if old Mother <HI>Jenisa</HI> was not still alive. No, o'my faith (quoth <HI>Harry</HI>) I believe there is no <HI>Potion</HI> in the Case, but a little <HI>Aurum Potabile.</HI> You will have more of this by and by.

<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since those worthy Persons, who are as much concern'd for your Safety as I am, have employ'd me as their Orator, I desire to know whither you will have it by way of <HI>Syllogism, Enthymem, Dilemma</HI> or <HI>Sorites.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident to all that are ver∣sed in History, that there were two <HI>Sisters</HI> that play'd the Whore, two thousand Years ago: Therefore it plainly follows, that it is not lawful for <HI>John Bull</HI> to have any manner
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
of Entercourse with <HI>Lewis Baboon.</HI> If it is not lawful for <HI>John Bull</HI> to have any manner of Entercourse (Correspondence, if you will, that is much the same thing) then <HI>a Fortiori,</HI> it is much more unlawful for the said <HI>John</HI> to make over his Wife and Children to the said <HI>Lewis;</HI> if his Wife and Children are not to be made over, he is not to wear a Dagger and Ratsbane in his <HI>Pockets;</HI> if he wears a Dagger and Ratsbane, it must be to do Mis∣chief to himself or some body else; if he in∣tends to do Mischief, he ought to be under Guardians, and there is none so fit as my self and some other worthy Persons, who have a Commission for that purpose from <HI>Nic. Frog,</HI> the Executor of his Will and Te∣stament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this is your <HI>Sorites,</HI> you say; with that he snatch'd a good tough Oaken Cudgel, and began to brandish it; then hap∣py was the Man that was first at the Door; crouding to get out, they tumbled down Stairs, and it is credibly reported some of them drop'd very valuable Things in the hurry, which were pick'd up by others of the Family.</P>
</SP>
<P>That any of these Rogues (quoth <HI>John</HI>) should imagine I am not as much concern'd as they about having my Affairs in a settled Condition, or that I would wrong my Heir for I know not what. Well <HI>Nic.</HI> I really can∣not but applaud thy Diligence, I must own

this is really a pretty sort of a Trick, but it shan't do thy Business for all that.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Lewis Baboon</HI> came to visit <HI>John Bull,</HI> and what pass'd between them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Think it is but ingenuous to acquaint the Reader, that this Chapter was not wrote by Sir <HI>Humphry</HI> himself, but by another very able <HI>Pen</HI> of the University of <HI>Grubstreet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> had (by some good Instructions that was given him by Sir <HI>Roger</HI>) got the better of his Cholerick Temper, and wrought himself up to a great steadiness of Mind, to pursue his own Interest through all Impediments that were thrown in the way; he began to leave off some of his old Aquaintance, his roaring and bullying about the Streets; he put on a se∣rious Air, knit his Brows, and for the time had made a very considerable progress in Po∣liticks, considering that he had been kept a stranger to his own Affairs. However, he could not help discovering some remains of his Nature, when he happen'd to meet with a Foot-Ball, or a Match at Cricket; for which Sir <HI>Roger</HI> was sure to take him to task. <HI>John</HI> was walking about his Room with folded Arms, and a most thoughtful Countenance, his Servant brought him Word that one <HI>Lewis</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
<HI>Baboon</HI> below wanted to speak with him. <HI>John</HI> had got an Impression that <HI>Lewis</HI> was so deadly a cunning Man, that he was afraid to venture himself alone with him: At last he took heart of Grace. <HI>Let him come up</HI> (quoth he) <HI>it is but sticking to my Point, and he can never over-reach me.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lewis Baboon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Bull</HI> I will frankly acknowledge, that my Behaviour to my Neighbours has been somewhat uncivil, and I believe you will readily grant me, that I have met with Usage accordingly. I was fond of Back-sword and Cudgel play from my Youth, and I now bear in my Body many a black and blue Gash and Scars, God knows. I had as good a Ware-house, and as fair Possessions as any of my Neighbours, tho' I say it; but a contentious Temper, flattering Servants, and unfortunate Stars, have brought me in∣to Circumstances that are not unknown to you. These my Misfortunes are heighten'd by domestick Calamities, that I need not re∣late. I am a poor old batter'd Fellow, and I would willingly end my Days in Peace: But alas, I see but small hopes of that, for every new Circumstance affords an Argument to my Enemies to pursue their Revenge; for∣merly I was to be bang'd because I was too Strong, and now because I am too Weak to resist, I am to be brought down when too Rich, and oppressed when too Poor. <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> has used me like a <HI>Scoundrel;</HI> You are a
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
Gentleman, and I freely put my self in your Hands, to dispose of me as you think fit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Master <HI>Baboon,</HI> as to your Usage of your Neighbours, you had best not dwell too much upon that Chapter; let it suffice at present that you have been met with, you have been rolling a great Stone up∣hill all your Life, and at last it has come tum∣bling down till it is like to crush you to pieces: Plain-dealing is best. If you have any par∣ticular Mark, Mr. <HI>Baboon,</HI> whereby one may know when you Fib, and when you speak Truth, you had best tell it me, that one may proceed accordingly; but since at present I know of none such, it is better that you should trust me, than that I should trust you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Baboon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know of no particular Mark of Veracity, amongst us Tradesmen, but In∣terest; and it is manifestly mine not to deceive you at this time; you may safely trust me, I can assure you.</P>

<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>

<P>How could Monsieur <HI>Bull</HI> be so grosly abused by downright Nonsense? They that advised you to refuse, must have belie∣ved I intended to give, else why would they not make the Experiment? But I can tell you more of that Matter than perhaps you know at present.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I consider the late ill Usage I have met with from you, I was reflecting what it was that could provoke you to it; but upon a narrow Inspection into my Con∣duct, I can find nothing to reproach my self with, but too partial a Concern for your Interest. You no sooner set this Composition a-foot, but I was ready to comply, and prevented your very Wishes; and the Affair might have been ended be∣fore now, had it not been for the greater Concerns of <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>South,</HI> and the other poor Creatures, embark'd in the same Common Cause, whose Safety touches me to the Quick. You seem'd a little jealous that I bad dealt unfairly with you in Money-mat∣ters,
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
till it appear'd by your own Ac∣counts, that there was something due to me upon the Ballance. Having nothing to answer to so plain a Demonstration, you began to complain as if I had been fami∣liar with your Reputation; when it is well known, not only I, but the meanest Ser∣vant in my Family, talk of you with the utmost Respect. I have always, as far as in me lies, exhorted your Servants and Tenants to be dutiful; not that I any ways meddle in your domestick Affairs, which were very unbecoming for me to do. If some of your Servants express their great Concern for you in a manner that is not so very polite, you ought to impute it to their extraordinary Zeal, which deserves a Reward rather than a Reproof. You can∣not reproach me for want of Success at the <HI>Salutation,</HI> since I am not Master of the Passions and Interests of other Folks. I have beggar'd my self with this Law-Suit, undertaken merely in Complaisance to you; and if you would have had but a little Pa∣tience, I had still greater things in Reserve that I intended to have done for you. I hope what I have said will prevail with you to lay aside your unreasonable Jealousies, and that we may have no more Meetings at the <HI>Salutation,</HI> spending our Time and Money to no Purpose. My Concern for your Welfare and Prosperity, almost makes
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>

<P><HI>John</HI> receiv'd this with a good deal of <HI>Sang froid; Transeat</HI> (quoth <HI>John</HI>) <HI>cum caeteris erroribus:</HI> He was now at his Ease; he saw he could now make a very good Bargain for himself, and a very safe one for other Folks. My Shirt (quoth he) is near me, but my Skin is nearer: Whilst I take care of the Welfare of other Folks, no body can blame me, to apply a little Balsam to my own Sores. It's a pretty thing, after all, for a Man to do his own Business: a Man has such a tender Concern for himself, there's nothing like it. This is somewhat better, I trow, than for <HI>John Bull</HI> to be standing in the Market, like a great Dray-horse, with <HI>Frog</HI>'s Paws upon his Head, <HI>What will ye give me for this Beast? Serviteur</HI> Nic. Frog, <HI>you may kiss my Backside if you please.</HI> Though <HI>John Bull</HI> has not read your <HI>Aristotles, Plato</HI>'s, and <HI>Machiavels,</HI> he can see us far into a Milstone as another: With that <HI>John</HI> began to chuckle and laugh, till he was like to burst his Sides.</P>

<P>You know I am your Tenant; the Difference between my Lease and an Inhe∣ritance is such a Trifle, as I am sure you will not grudge your poor Friend, that will be an Encouragement to go on; besides, it will make <HI>Bull</HI> as mad as the Devil: You and I shall be able to manage him then to some purpose.</P>

<P><HI>John,</HI> all this while, was listening to this comical Dialogue, and laugh'd heartily in his Sleeve, at the Pride and Simplicity of the <HI>Esquire,</HI> and the sly Roguery of his Friend <HI>Nic.</HI> Then of a sudden bolting into the Room, he began to tell them, that he believ'd he had brought <HI>Lewis</HI> to reasonable Terms, if they would please to hear them.</P>
<P>Then they all bawl'd out aloud, <HI>No Com∣position, Long live Esquire</HI> South <HI>and the Law!</HI> As <HI>John</HI> was going to proceed, some roar'd, some stamp'd with their Feet, others stop'd their Ears with their Fingers.</P>
<P>Nay, Gentlemen (quoth <HI>John</HI>) if you will but stop proceeding for a while, you shall judge your selves whether <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Proposals are reasonable.</P>

<P>When <HI>Frog</HI> took Possession of any thing, it was always said to be for <HI>Ʋs,</HI> and why may not <HI>John Bull</HI> be <HI>Ʋs,</HI> as well as <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> was <HI>Ʋs?</HI> I hope <HI>John Bull</HI> is no more con∣fin'd to Singularity than <HI>Nic. Frog;</HI> or take it so, the constant Doctrine that thou hast preach'd up for many Years, was that Thou and I are One; and why must we be sup∣posed Two in this Case, that were always One before? It's impossible that Thou and I can fall out <HI>Nic.</HI> we must trust one another: I have trusted thee with a great many things, prithee trust me with this one Trifle.</P>

<P>That Principle is true in the main; but there is some Speciality in this Case, that makes it highly inconvenient for us both.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The rest of <HI>Nic</HI>'s Fetches to keep <HI>John</HI> out of <HI>Ecclesdoun-</HI>Castle.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN <HI>Nic.</HI> could not diswade <HI>John</HI> by Argument, he try'd to move his Pity, he pretended to be sick and like to dye, that he should leave his Wife and Children in a starving Condition, if <HI>John</HI> did abandon him; that he was hardly able to craul about the Room, far less capable to look after such a troublesome Business as this Law-suit, and therefore begg'd that his good Friend would not leave him. When he saw that <HI>John</HI> was still inexorable, he pull'd out a Case-Knife, with which he used to Sneaker-snee, and threaten'd to cut his own Throat. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thrice he aim'd the Knife to his Wind pipe with a most determin'd threatning Air. What signifies Lise (quoth he) in this languishing Condition, it will be some Pleasure that my Friends will revenge my Death upon this barbarous Man, that has been the Cause of it?</Q> All this while <HI>John</HI> look'd Se∣date and Calm, neither offering in the least to snatch the Knife, nor stop his Blow, trusting to the Tenderness <HI>Nic.</HI> had for his own Per∣son:
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
When he perceiv'd that <HI>John</HI> was im∣moveable in his Purpose, he apply'd himself to <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P>Art thou (quoth he) turn'd Bubble in thy Old Age, from being a Sharper in thy Youth? what occasion hast thou to give up <HI>Eccles∣doun-</HI>Castle to <HI>John Bull?</HI> his Friendship is not worth a Rush, give it me and I'll make it worth the while. If thou dislikest that Propo∣sition, keep it thy self, I'd rather thou should∣est have it than he. If thou hearkens not to my Advice, take what follows; Esquire <HI>South</HI> and I will go on with our Law-suit in spite of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Teeth.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nic. Frog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I tell thee thou art an old doating Fool. With that <HI>Nic</HI> bounc'd up with a Spring equal to that of one of your nim∣blest Tumblers or Rope dancers, falls foul upon <HI>John Bull</HI> to snatch the Cudgel he had in his Hand, that he might Thwack <HI>Lewis</HI> with it. <HI>John</HI> held it fast, so that there was no wrenching it from him. At last <HI>Esquire South</HI> buckl'd to, to assist his Friend <HI>Nic. John</HI> hall'd on one side, and they two on the other; sometimes they were like to pull <HI>John</HI> over; then it went, all of a sudden again, on <HI>John</HI>'s side, so they went see-sawing up and down, from one End of the Room to the
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
other: Down tumbl'd the Tables, Bottles, Glassēs, and Tobacco Pipes: The Wine and the Tobacco were all spilt about the Room, and the little Fellows were almost trod un∣der Foot, 'till more of the Tradesmen joyn∣ing with <HI>Nic.</HI> and the Esquire, <HI>John</HI> was hardly able to pull against them all, yet he never quit hold of his trusty Cudgel; which by the contranitent Force of two so great Powers, broke short in his Hands. <HI>Nic.</HI> seiz'd the longer end, and with it began to Bastinado Old <HI>Lewis,</HI> who had slunk into a Corner, waiting the Event of this Squabble. <HI>Nic</HI> came up to him with an insolent mena∣cing Air, so that the old Fellow was forc'd to skuttle out of the Room, and retire be∣hind a Dung-cart: He call'd to <HI>Nic,</HI> thou insolent Jackanapes, time was when thou durst not have used me so, thou now takest me unprovided, but old and infirm as I am, I shall find a Weapon by and by to chastise thy Impudence.</P>
</SP>
<P>When <HI>John Bull</HI> had recover'd his Breath, he began to parly with <HI>Nic. Friend</HI> Nic, <HI>I am glad to find thee so strong after thy great Com∣plaints; really thy Motions</HI> Nic. <HI>are pretty Vigo∣rous for a consumptive Man.</HI> As for thy world∣ly Affairs <HI>Nic,</HI> if it can do thee any Service, I freely make over to thee this profitable Law-suit; and I desire all these Gentlemen to bear witness to this my Act and Deed, yours be all the Gain, as mine has been the

<P><HI>John Bull</HI> was so over-joy'd that he was going to take Possession of <HI>Ecclesdoun,</HI> that nothing could vex him. <HI>Nic</HI> (quoth he) <HI>I am just a going to leave thee, cast a kind look upon me at parting.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the great Joy that <HI>John</HI> express'd when he got Possession of <HI>Ecclesdoun.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN <HI>John</HI> had got into his Castle, he seem'd like <HI>Ʋlysses</HI> upon his Plank after he had been well sous'd in Salt-water; who (as <HI>Homer</HI> says) was as glad as a Judge go∣ing to sit down to Dinner, after hearing a long Cause upon the Bench. I dare say <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Joy was equal to that of either of the two; he skip'd from Room to Room; ran up Stairs and down Stairs, from the Kitchen to the Garrets, and from the Garrets to the Kitchen; he peep'd into every Crany; some∣times he admired the Beauty of the Archi∣tecture, and the vast Solidity of the Masons Work; at other times he commended the Sy∣metry and Proportion of the Rooms. He walk'd
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
about the Gardens; he Bath'd himself in the Canal, swimming, diving, and beating the li∣quid Element, like a milk-white Swan. The Hall resounded with the sprightly Violin and the martial Hautboy. The Family trip'd it about and Caper'd like <HI>Hail-stones bounding from a Marble Floor:</HI> Wine, Ale and October flew about as plentifully as Kennel-Water; then a Frolick took <HI>John</HI> in the Head to call up some of <HI>Nic Frog</HI>'s Pensioners that had been so mutinous in his Family.</P>
