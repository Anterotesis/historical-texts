<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE high admiration I ever felt for the superior talents you have so eminently displayed in ALMEYDA, could alone have induced me to venture a second drama∣tick production. To that admiration, a more intimate knowledge of you, has added an esteem; which is, I flat∣ter myself, reciprocal. Not all the various charms you dignify the Drama with, can equal those of your sympa∣thizing mind, and unassuming manners.—When thus united, they form a character it would be vanity to praise, tho' virtue to delight in. With true gratitude,</P>
<CLOSER>I remain, <SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT was with no less awe than deference I ventured, in the present day, to bring a Tragedy before the Publick. How great, then, must be my gratitude for the liberal acceptation it has met, and the tears with which it has been honoured. I must have wanted taste and feeling, not to have been animated, by the exquisite talents of Mrs. SIDDONS, into an exertion of such as I possess. That I have been the means of displaying, in a new point of view, her various powers, is a most flattering recompence.</P>
<P>The story of ALMEYDA is wholly a fiction; and the incident which produces the catastrophe the only one not my own.—The deep impression made on me, long since, by a similar <HI>denouement,</HI> in an old play of JAMES SHIR∣LEY's, determined me to apply it.</P>
<P>The Stage requires a compression and brevity, which seldom improves a play to the reader: I have, therefore, printed ALMEYDA at length, marking by inverted commas the parts omitted in representation.</P>

<L>THE Muses long through many a varying age,</L>
<L>With truth and fiction mix'd, have grac'd the stage.</L>
<L>When weeping Constancy devoted stood,</L>
<L>Or patriot Honour seal'd his faith with blood,</L>
<L>They bade the deep-toned lyre responsive flow,</L>
<L>Sublimed the suffering, and diffused the woe;</L>
<L>Applauding Greece the numbers lov'd to hear,</L>
<L>And her stern warriors gave the graceful tear.</L>
<L>At length her venal train Corruption led,</L>
<L>And, with the Virtues link'd, the muses fled</L>
<L>O'er Albion's happy land they paus'd awhile,</L>
<L>And shed the favouring influence of their smile.</L>
<L>Her HENRYS, HOTSPURS, trod the martial scene,</L>
<L>And sir'd to heroes whom they found but men.</L>
<L>Bold SHAKESPEAR pour'd th' invigorating strain,</L>
<L>And ROWE, and sweeter OTWAY, fill'd the train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What if the modern bard no more aspire,</L>
<L>To rival OTWAY's sweetness, SHAKESPEAR's fire;</L>
<L>What if no laurel meed his altar claim,</L>
<L>His censer boast no heav'n-enkindled flame,</L>
<L>Yet if beneath the smould'ring vapour shine</L>
<L>But one faint glimmering of the spark divine,</L>
<L>Ah! gently fan the flame! lest fashion's breath</L>
<L>O'er the pale promise send the blast of death;</L>
<L>Nor let the wreath Thalia only wear,</L>
<L>Her sister muse deserves so well to share.</L>
<L>'Tis her's the generous feeling to impart,</L>
<L>That mends the morals while it fills the heart:</L>
<L>Her's are the energies that best inform,</L>
<L>The sighs that animate, and tears that warm.</L>
<L>Within the magic sunshine of her eye,</L>
<L>Truth, Honour, Loyalty, and Valour lie;</L>

<L>All the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord virtues that our sires approved,</L>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly, and Vice, may oft in smiles appear,</L>
<L>But bashful Virtue veils her in a tear.</L>
<L>The bread, loud laugh, the mirth-inspiring jest,</L>
<L>Humour's wild frolic, and gay fancy's feast,</L>
<L>Like brilliant bubbles sparkle o'er the mind,</L>
<L>But burst, and leave no radiant gleam behind;</L>
<L>While the bright pencil of the tragic muse,</L>
<L>Her sacred rainbow draws o'er chilling dews;</L>
<L>And tho' to air the transient glories run,</L>
<L>They give the promise of a golden sun!</L>

<L>Thus did Almeyda's—yet an infant hostage,</L>
<L>She wak'd to knowledge on a foe's kind bosom.</L>
<L>Her lips first falter'd our Castilian tongue,</L>

<L>In those who fondly train'd her up to honor,</L>
