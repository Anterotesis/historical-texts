<P>TO THE LORD VISCOUNT NEWARK, BARON PIERREPONT, OF HOLME PIERREPONT, IN THE COUNTY OF NOTTINGHAM: L. L. D. <HI>This small Tribute of Respect and Friendship Is offered, and,</HI> With His Lordship's Permission, <HI>Inscribed, By the Translater.</HI></P>

<PB REF="5"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are conversant in the French Drama, will readily perceive that the <HI>Captive of Spilburg</HI> is little else than a translation of <HI>Le Souter∣rain.</HI> In adapting it to the English stage, endeavours have been used to select the most striking and in∣teresting features of the Original. The principal Alteration consists in the Airs, which, when new Mu∣sic is to be composed, it is seldom of any advan∣tage to translate.</P>
<P>Much censure has of late been cast on the neg∣ligence of those who write <HI>words</HI> for Musical Com∣positions. —That some remissness should creep in upon a laborious task, where the utmost diligence
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>can attain little praise, will be no subject of sur∣prize to any one accoustomed to habits of ap∣plication: but that indulgence may fairly be ex∣tended to writers of this description may be infer∣red from the apology made by the great Dryden for himself on this subject. In speaking of the diffi∣culties of our language, in musical composition, he says <Q>it consists too much of monosyllables, and those too most commonly clogg'd with consonants, for which reason, (he adds) I am often forced to coin new words, revive some that are antiquated, and botch others, as if I had not served out my time in Poetry, but was bound 'Prentice to some Doggrel Rhimer, who makes songs to tunes and sings them for a livelihood. 'Tis true I have not been often put to this drudgery; but, <HI>where I have, the words sufficiently shew, that I was then a slave to the composition,</HI> which I will never be again.</Q> In fact the diligent writer of words to be adapted to Music goes to work with fewer materials than any other, with a vocabulary <HI>disfurnished</HI> of at least one third of his language.
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>All close sounds, all words ending in mutes, all in which many consonants are perceptible to the ear; are unfavourable to, and some times incompatible with his purpose. What embarrassment this re∣striction produces, and how greatly it impedes the efforts of a writer, <HI>Experiment</HI> will best ascertain.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for this species of writing, it is likewise liable to censure from the errors of others as well as of the writer. The Music of every suc∣cessful Dramatic Production is immediately pub∣lished, and words are annexed to it, which, from the frequent inaccuracy (in that point) of the Cop∣per Plate Engraver, are <HI>very falsely said to be writ∣ten</HI> by the Author of the Piece. But this the judi∣cious observer will easily discriminate.</P>
<P>The Translator of the present Drama is as fully aware as the most splenetic critic can be, that pro∣ductions of this kind are of no great importance to the retired reader. They are however the food of the Stage; and a really comprehensive and can∣did
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>mind will not estimate their merits merely by the scale of Literature, but will recollect that the Theatre demands action, that the best written plays <HI>may</HI> be the most unfit for representation, and that without this consideration the most accurate judge of books will be a very inadequate censor of dra∣matic writings.</P>

<P>Alehouse or inn—the village affords no better. Drinking is every where the noblest employment of a soldier; for what makes a brave soldier? contempt of danger. And what inspires contempt of danger? Why, drinking.</P>

<P>I do not much value the bravery of a man in his cups.</P>

<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold thy peace, Tachstein, thou art ig∣norant; thou abusest speech, when thou say'st a man is in his cups, forsooth, as tho' the wine swallowed the man, and not the man the wine. Never say a man is in liquor; 'tis a foolish phrase; he is not in the liquor, but the liquor in him. Were some men in the liquor they drink, God help us!—they might be drown'd.</P>
