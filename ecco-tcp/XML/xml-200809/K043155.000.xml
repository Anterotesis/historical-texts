<BYLINE>Written by the AUTHOR,</BYLINE>
<P>And spoken by Mr. WILSON.</P>
<SP>
<L>BEFORE we poll, the town I wish to sound,</L>
<L>And canvass for your votes and int'rest round:</L>
<L>No bribes I bring, to influence your voice,</L>
<L>Our Candidate aims at, being Freedom's choice;</L>
<L>If unsuccessful, he assures this borough,</L>
<L>He'll call no critic scrutiny to-morrow;</L>
<L>The public judgment, he abides with awe,</L>
<L>And owns your right to give the drama law.</L>
<L>Sir Listless Lounge, with well-bred yawn, declares,</L>
<L>He dreads encount'ring your election bears;</L>
<L>What with the toil of canvassing, he vows,</L>
<L>And making speeches when one's in the house,</L>
<L>So much of rights, and liberties they rave,</L>
<L>In these free states a man's a downright slave!</L>
<L>"Oh! keep one borough, says Paddy, to spare,</L>
<L>"To give Captain Moore a bit of a share,</L>
<L>"He bate four ships, joy, before he took one!</L>
<L>"And he and I came from the very same town."</L>
<L>May we, unblam'd, with Humour's lightest wing,</L>
<L>Thus touch the surface of pure Freedom's spring.</L>
<L>To treat of liberty, in our weak lays,</L>
<L>Is placing soil beneath the diamond's blaze.</L>
<L>Oh, may our arms to that bright gem restore</L>
<L>The splendor which it boasted long before!</L>
<L>Nor need we long despair to see that day,</L>
<L>When vengeance shall foul treachery betray,</L>
<L>Since Cornwallis commands, and Tarlton leads the fray.</L>
<L>Then peace once more shall rear her angel head,</L>
<L>Bright as the Phoenix, from her burning bed.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU are a fool, Letty; you don't know what it is to be married to a parliment-man: he can do such things, child! lord, he can do any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, father, some parliment-men of late have proved they can do any thing. But surely, you can never think my booby cousin will cut any figure in the House of Commons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, why not, you satyrical baggage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>He can't say boo! to a goose.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he can nick the time to say aye, or no, he'll do more than a better orator.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to compleat the ridicule, his mother canvasses for him. Sure the spirit of absurdity has de∣scended upon our family, and determined we should be a public laughing-stock. She would have me with her yesterday; and such a tramp as we had! She took me through all the filthy alleys in town; then we were obliged to kiss the children in every house we went into, be they never so dirty, and keep a pocket full of halfpence to slip into her hands; a proof, dear father, of what a bribe can do, when we can purchase nothing but a rattle with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this was mere pastime to what I have gone through on my canvass. I went yesterday to so∣licit the vote and interest of old Smoke Jack, the chimney-sweeper, and found his whole family seated at a banquet of ox-cheek and bacon. I was pressed to eat you may be sure; so down I sat between his two eldest boys, as he called them, so black! that they looked more like two organized bags of soot than hu∣man beings. I sat clear for some time, 'till one of the lads reaching his brother the bread across me, black'd all the side of my coat, which, as ill-luck would have it, happened to be cream-coloured. His father, mad at his ill manners, got up to strike him; when the boy, in striving to escape, threw me and his brother down, and before I got up I was black enough to pass for one of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>And wasn't this sufficient to give you a sur∣feit of canvassing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, getting a dirty coat? no, no, I never mind dirt in serving my country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, sir, how happy were we before you took this notion in your head! I then had hopes my dear Belfield would be mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he takes pains to provoke me; he has set up in opposition to George; has open'd a house, writes ballads, gets drunk, and is rising every day into consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, heavens! if he should be return'd, per∣haps then, sir, you would relent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, don't make me mad! he shan't be returned: George shall carry you and his election together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Letit.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may be returned for the borough of Bribewell, but Belfield has an interest in my heart, which no venal candidate can rob him of.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Letitia.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grumble as much as you please, ma'am, but I am determined your marriage articles, and the writs for the new parliment, shall be returnable toge∣ther. I fancy there are sew who can say as much for themselves as Joe Parmazan. I was bred a cheese∣monger, 'tis true, but what of that? when I have a son in the house, his cloquence will pare off the rind of my obscurity. I hope, like his father, be'll have all the blue mold of patriotism about him. Let me see, how stand my morning expences, (<HI>Pulls the dif∣ferent articles out of his pocket as be names them</HI>) I have above three hundred pounds worth of goods in my pockets, that at a just appraisement would not be va∣lued at twenty shillings; but election wares are ticklish articles, and whilst the fair lasts, keen chapmen will
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>have their prices. Here's a piece of gingerbread that cost me five guineas, that I could have bought for a penny at any baker's in London, but no price is thought too high for real parliment cakes. A child's trumpet too! a pretty play-thing this for a man of my age! It cost me two guineas, and I must wait 'till my grandson is born to blow me a tune upon it. Here's fifty pounds slap in a case of razors. These razors may shave keen, but I think they never will cut so close as the fellow who sold them. Here's a toothpick-case, cost me twenty pounds. If a man was to pay every day in the same proportion for his dinner, he might soon shut up his mouth, and give his teeth a holiday! But oh, monstrous! in this paper I have a hundred hob-nails, for which I paid a hun∣dred pounds down upon the nail; I was nail'd hard in that bargain. Here is some Scotch snuff, and some court sticking-plaister, which cost me very dear; but I don't mind that, as they are articles which will be of great use to the Member when he gets into the house.</P>

<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>My deat Canvass, how do you go on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Can.</SPEAKER>
<P>Swimmingly, swimmingly, sir. I have secured all Corruption-row, Bribewell-alley, and Guz∣zledown-street, to a single elector.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was my sister with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Can.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but she did me more harm than good: she's too old to have any interest with the men, and the elector's wives like to be kissed by the canvasser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, so they do, and if possible I should have undertaken the whole canvass myself; but as I am rather too old now for so much business, my dear boy, don't spare yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Can.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's Full Bottom, the barber, what have you done with him? I understand that he can com∣mand two votes besides his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! he's one of us. 'Twas I set him up; he's only a housekeeper three days. He lived in a dark hole he called a shop, at the sign of <HI>Gentlemen shaved for a penny,</HI> upon a paper lanthorn. The other two votes are his journeymen, fellows who have been all their lives garret-housekeepers; but I have given security for a quarter's rent to qualify them.</P>

<P>Mr. Goose, the taylor, sir, has just rode up to the door, and desires to speak with you.</P>

<P>I have bespoke five suits of clothes of this Goose, and yet the fellow has the impudence to talk of his con∣science, and refusing a bribe.</P>

<HI>Enter</HI> Goose, <HI>booted and spurred.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mr. Goose, I have been just wish∣ing for you. Come, sit down, sit down, and tell us the news.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have rode hard, Mr. Parmazan, to serve you, and as I take no bribes, I hope my horse hire will be paid for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have the best gelding in my stable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't take it; my conscience is buckram to a bribe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear friend, consider that you gave me your vote and interest, before I made this offer. Why, if one friend cannot make another friend a pre∣sent now and then, without incurring the censure of corruption, there's no friendship lest in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a shred. Friendship's like broad-cloth, it wears well in all weathers. But I have had a sad journey of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fright, I believe, was the worst of it; for you must know, that this was the first time I ever mounted any thing but a shop-board.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must want some refreshment—Here, get some wine.—Which do you choose, red or white?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no choice. Good cloth's never of a bad colour.</P>

<P>Then put that pint bottle of the choice Madeira on the table. That bottle, I assure you, is twelve years old.</P>

<P>Mercy on us! it's the littlest thing of its age I ever saw.</P>

<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, George's health to the bottom of your glass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll not leave a remnant behind me. <STAGE>(Drinks.)</STAGE> I made his first suit; who wou'd have thought I was taking measure of a Parliament Man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now let us proceed to business.—You must know, my worthy friend, I intend you for a leading man in my committee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't say so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's something so consequential in your countenance, so manly in your manner, spite of your profession, that you must command great respect in a croud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odzookers, what must I say to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Huzza! as often as possible. Cry no bribery, no corruption, no hired mob; and if our party meetmuch opposition, cry, no Scotchmen, and it will do wonders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, damn the Scotch with all my heart; they are no friends to our trade; I hear as how one half of them wear no breeches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Off to the committee then immediately, and be sure to cry loudly for liberty and property, and the constitution.</P>

<SPEAKER>Goose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend Parmazan, the skirts of the consti∣tution are grown too long. The lappells and buttons are increasing, and they ought to be cut short after a new fashion.</P>

<P>There is a confusion, George, in your ideas, that makes me tremble for your success as a speaker in the House of Commons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure they won't make me speaker of the House the first time I go in? I can speak to be sure, but I must be a little us'd to my company.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Hig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has your oratorical preceptor been here yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>My roar-otorical preceptor, you should call him, for he makes me bawl 'till I am hoarse again. What do you think, mother, he would hav me clap two pebbles in my mouth to make me talk clear. He told me De—De—De, something, a great Gre∣cian parliament man, didn't speak a jot better than me, till he used these pebbles.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, I solicit your support, this day, to be returned one of your representatives; because I consider the confidence of the people to be the highest poslible honour an Englishman can boast. It is reposing the most sacred trust in him; from the moment he receives it, he becomes guarantee to the people for the safety of their dearest rights; and can∣not neglect or betray them without criminality. If he acts the faithful servant, his wages will be pre∣cious; for he will be paid with the love of his coun∣try.
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>Whatever my ability be, it shall be exerted in your service; no private views, of interest or ambi∣tion, should influence the servant of the people; he should drop <HI>self,</HI> and all the meanness of its depen∣dant passions; and feel, think, and act only for the good and prosperity of the commonweal. If chosen, by your free voices, I pledge myself to act upon this broad scale of honour and truth; and though my ta∣lents may want splendor to dazzle in my country's cause, the integrity of my heart shall remain its in∣corruptible champion.</P>
