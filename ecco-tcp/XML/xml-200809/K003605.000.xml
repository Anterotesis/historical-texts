<SP>
<SPEAKER>THE AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>THOUGH oft the heart, when raging passions storm,</L>
<L>To Vice we kneel, and fain would veil her form,</L>
<L>Her native darkness ever mocks disguise,</L>
<L>And crimes look foul, e'en in their author's eyes.</L>
<L>Here the first mark of heav'nly vengeance view;</L>
<L>Vice, false to others, to herself is true!</L>
<L>When the pack'd jury, and the quibbled flaw</L>
<L>Delude the eye, and lame the arm of law;</L>
<L>When Erskine's wit the culprit-client saves,</L>
<L>And fraud unscourged offended justice braves; <MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Still is the wretch in private doom'd to hear</L>
<L>From his own heart a verdict more severe.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
There dwells a judge, whose voice no bribe can pay,</L>
<L>No party silence, and no flattery sway;</L>
<L>The sinner shrinks, before himself arraign'd,</L>
<L>And almost sorrows, that his cause is gain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor does his guilt himself alone disgust;</L>
<L>The world condemns, for here the world is just:</L>
<L>Unpunish'd crimes still shock the public ear,</L>
<L>And crimes unpunish'd doubly foul appear.<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then why, Emilius, thus in furious strain</L>
<L>Of broken faith, and laws corrupt complain?</L>
<L>Less warmth, my testy friend; more justly sound</L>
<L>Your injury's depth, nor call your scratch a wound.</L>
<L>With plenteous store by Fortune's bounty blest,</L>
<L>Of bonds, and stock, and fertile lands possest,</L>
<L>Your loss is trifling, and so trite your case,</L>
<L>Scarce in the public prints 'twill find a place.</L>
<L>While, then, we mark your breast with passion rise,</L>
<L>Your trembling lips, clench'd hands, and flashing eyes,<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>When ask'd the cause, how poor the answer sounds,</L>
<L>"A friend is false! I've lost a thousand pounds."—</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
A friend is false? Does that amaze the eye</L>
<L>Which lately saw its sixtieth year go by?</L>
<L>Has age then bleach'd your raven locks in vain,</L>
<L>Impair'd your limbs, and not matur'd your brain?</L>
<L>Oh! mourn your dross no more: with tears lament</L>
<L>Your mind unfurnish'd, and your time mispent.</L>
<L>Blest is the man, whom philosophic lore</L>
<L>Beyond proud Fortune's reach has taught to soar; <MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Who, when she frowns, her falshood not reviles,</L>
<L>Nor boasts her favour when the harlot smiles.</L>
<L>Nor him less happy count, whose years have bought</L>
<L>Precious experience, and deep-searching thought,</L>
<L>Wisdom to know all bliss is insecure,</L>
<L>Courage to hope, and patience to endure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, loud complainant, does the rolling year</L>
<L>Present one day from fraud or knavery clear,</L>
<L>Whose spotless White no thefts, no murders stain,</L>

<L>In vain you search:—yet still the search pursue,</L>
<L>Examine men, and find of good how few!</L>

So few, alas! that if that guilt to fly</L>
<L>Which daily, hourly, here disgusts the eye,</L>
<L>The just resolv'd to leave the British strand,</L>
<L>And seek some distant less polluted land,</L>
<L>The whole fair troop away with ease might bear</L>
<L>My lord-mayor's barge, and still have room to spare.</L>
<L>Now let the iron age no more be blam'd;</L>
<L>Blest should its memory be, when ours is nam'd,<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>For which no bard can find in nature's page</L>
<L>So base a metal as would mark the age!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet though ourselves still sin, not less we blame</L>
<L>Our neighbour's sin, and, when <HI>he</HI> errs, exclaim</L>
<L>Louder than fishwives scold, or asses bray,</L>
<L>Or Vapid puffs his own dry dull damn'd play!</L>
<L>All-hail, mouth-virtue! at your altar bend</L>
<L>Each canting hypocrite, and perjur'd friend;</L>
<L>Spare Lovegold sees his houshold god in you,</L>
<L>Who cost no sixpence, and who seem Peru!<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>

<L>Boy-witted Elder! must thou still be told,</L>
<L>No sorcerer's spell can witch an heart like gold?</L>

That in each guinea conqu'ring Cupids swarm,</L>
<L>And Venus less than good King George can charm?</L>
<L>Hear you not, how the rude but wiser crowd</L>
<L>Mock your simplicity with laughter loud,</L>
<L>When raving about faith, and virtuous dread,</L>
<L>And lightnings destin'd for each perjur'd head,</L>
<L>You hope the traitor (by your threats dismay'd)</L>
<L><HI>Will</HI> keep the promise, which he <HI>can</HI> evade?<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>If such things were, 'twas sure ere Adam fell,</L>
<L>Or Eve lost Eden for a nonpareil!</L>
<L>But now a debt if some strange man should own,</L>
<L>When neither bond or witness prove the loan,</L>
<L>To mark an act so just, and truth so rare,</L>
<L>His marble form should grace some public square,</L>
<L>And his name blazon'd in the historic page,</L>
<L>Attest that one good man adorn'd our age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For me, whene'er such acts of faith I hear,</L>
<L>Lost in amaze, and trusting scarce mine ear,<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>"Let all," I cry, "to view this wonder run,</L>

<L>Alas! my friend, an awful truth to tell,</L>
<L>There are, who scorn that heaven, and mock that hell.</L>
<L>In vain for these alternate seasons reign,</L>
<L>Spring robes the fields, and Autumn swells the grain;</L>
<L>In vain the moon now gilds the brow of night,</L>
<L>And now the sun pours floods of glorious light:</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
"'Twas chance," they cry, "to those fair orbs gave birth,</L>
<L>"And chance alone with produce bless'd the earth!"<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>Then boldly on the sacred book they lay</L>
<L>Their lips to swear some good man's wealth away,</L>
<L>And while his spoils their ravish'd eyes bewitch,</L>
<L>Laugh at poor rogues, less impious and less rich.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Others, whom timid guilt forbids to climb</L>
<L>Those dreadful heights where Atheists soar sublime,</L>
<L>Own that a Power Supreme exists on high,</L>
<L>But while they own a power, that power defy.</L>
<L>To these the priest inspir'd describes in vain</L>
<L>Each promis'd pleasure, and each threaten'd pain:<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>Heaven's future joys their notice scarce seem worth,</L>
<L>Wealth in <HI>this</HI> world, their present heaven on earth,</L>
<L>Nor fear they to deserve the Eternal's curse,</L>
<L>Hell bad, 'tis true, but want of money worse!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Let wrath divine," thus Gripe in transport cries,</L>
<L>"Curse every limb, and quench my blasted eyes,</L>
<L>"If still harmonious sounds mine ears may drink,</L>

"And still my palsied hands have power to hold,</L>
<L>"Close to my heart, this bag of darling gold!<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>"What! shall I fear, indignant Heaven to see</L>
<L>"Its magazine of plagues exhaust on me?</L>
<L>"What! shall I mourn the bargain made, if wealth</L>
<L>"I buy with loss of fame, and loss of health?</L>
<L>"No, still with glad content my heart shall beat,</L>
<L>"Though tortures rack my hands, my eyes, my feet,</L>
<L>"If hoards of gold my bursting coffers fill,</L>
<L>"Gold, which can soothe each pang, each fear can still,</L>

<L>"Yet why these fears? Celestial wrath, we know,<MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>"Though just, is merciful; though fierce, is slow:</L>
<L>"Perhaps too, when arrives the avenging hour,</L>
<L>"Repentant prayers may calm Heaven's angry power;</L>
<L>"Nor always in the world's vast book we find</L>
<L>"To equal sin an equal doom assigned.</L>

<L>"And while this rogue is doom'd in air to swing,</L>
<L>"That for a peerage kneels to thank the King."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sophist's fears thus calm'd, the legal war</L>
<L>No more he dreads, but dauntless seeks the bar,</L>
<L>Arrives before you, wonders why you stay,</L>
<L>And cries—"Sure conscience makes the wretch delay!"</L>
<L>Caught by his tranquil air and front of brass,</L>
<L>(Oft does for innocence assurance pass)</L>
<L>The judge declares your charge must groundless be,<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>Its malice blames, and sets the prisoner free;</L>
<L>While you with fiercer rage assert your cause,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet now, Emilius, let my prayers assuage</L>
<L>Awhile this flood of grief, this storm of rage,</L>

<HI>Your</HI> lack of temper suits <HI>my</HI> lack of wit,<MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>And boyish griefs with boyish counsels fit.</L>

<L>Some skilful hand should guide the surgeon's knife;</L>
<L>But who to bleed him Farquhar need retain,</L>
<L>When the next barber's boy could breathe the vein?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mark then!—If what you mourn, were some dire ill</L>
<L>No partner suffer'd, and no time could still;</L>
<L>If some strange curse, some plague to nature new,</L>
<L>On <HI>you</HI> had fall'n, and fall'n on none but you,</L>
<L>No word of mine should mock your publish'd pain,<MILESTONE N="220"/></L>
<L>Or strive to bind your wrath in reason's chain.</L>
<L>Who knows the human heart, must also know</L>
<L>How keen the pangs which make your sorrows flow:</L>
<L>Not with those sighs, which heave the nephew's heart,</L>
<L>Who sees his hoarding uncle's life depart;</L>
<L>Not with those tears, which custom bids be shed</L>
<L>By youthful widows for old husbands dead;</L>
<L>Grieve they, who dear departing wealth behold,</L>
<L>And mourn, not loss of friends, but loss of gold.</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
No forc'd affliction bids <HI>their</HI> sorrows rise; <MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L><HI>They</HI> need no onion to provoke their eyes;</L>
<L>No!—Lost that idol most adored and dear,</L>
<L>Heart-felt despair, wild rage, and grief sincere</L>
<L>Burst in each bitter sigh, gush in each scalding tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet sure, my friend, 'tis wrong, unusual rage</L>
<L>To feel at crimes so usual in this age,</L>
<L>Unless your lot by fate you hoped design'd</L>
<L>Free from all crosses common to mankind.</L>

<L>No pangs are yours past man's, past Heaven's relief,</L>
