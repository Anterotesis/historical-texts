<P>THE DUELLIST, A COMEDY.</P>
<P>AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN.</P>
<P>WRITTEN BY W. KENRICK, LL. D.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extract from the PUBLIC ADVERTISER of Monday, November 22, 1773.</HEAD>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>ON Saturday last, a new comedy, called the Duellist, was performed, for the first time, at Covent-Garden Theatre. Previous to the curtain being drawn up, the following written hand-bill was dispersed about the house.</P>
<Q>Mr. Macklin has been pursued by a malicious party to such a pitch of rancour, that at last they have succeeded so far in their cursed designs, as to get him discharged this Theatre, and thereby have deprived him of the means of a livelihood : There∣fore if the Public have any spirit, they will not suffer the new play to begin till Mr. Colman pro∣mises that Mr. Macklin shall be engaged again.</Q>
<P>This hand-bill found its way into the Green-Room, and had a very visible effect on the per∣formers, as was plainly evident from their confusion. The piece was received with great marks of appro∣bation, and given out again for Monday, which was attended with some hissing, but that was greatly overpowered by the general applause of the audience. The overture to <HI>Thomas and Sally</HI> being attended to with silence, the greatest part of the Author's Friends, quitted the Theatre ; which being taken advantage
<PB REF="4"/>
of by a party in the gallery, a riot ensued ; and the entertainment was not suffered to go on till another play was given out for Monday.</P></Q>
<P>To the above concise relation of the circumstances attending the representation of the following Comedy (as it is given by one of the most respectable of our diurnal historians) the Author of the Duellist makes no exception or addition. He would be wanting, however, in that respect, which he has ever professed and shewn for the public opinion, did he not endea∣vour to obviate some objections that have been made to his Piece, and to account, as well as he is able, for the unprecedented severity of its treatment.</P>
<P>As to the author's pretensions to merit in this spe∣cies of writing, it is not for him to boast, were there cause for boasting. Because, sensible of the necessi∣ty of a dramatic writer's making the theatre the con∣stant scene of his observation, he can without morti∣fication admit that an author, whose study is the stage, bids fairer for success on it than another, who, engaged at a distance in more scientific researches, makes its amusements only his occasional relaxation from severer and more laborious pursuits. Not that he is without reason to be flattered with the applause his performance met with in representation ; though, were it otherwise, he should not have the vanity to copy after a Corneille, who, in the preface to his Pertharite, which was universally condemned, avows boldly, that in spite of censure his play was a good one and well written. He would have confidence
<PB REF="5"/>
enough, however, in imitation of as great a writer of our own country, to declare, with Dryden, that the town "had received with applause, as bad and as uncorrect plays from other men." As a writer by profession, therefore, whose family depends on his industry, he conceives it not only prudential in him to convert his amusements to profit, but that he has a right to expect the theatres should be as open to receive his productions as those of others. It is true, he has not found it so, and is singularly un∣lucky in having his pieces performed with impartial applause, and then partially banished the stage. He is not ashamed to declare he writes plays not from in∣clination but from expediency : the object in his view being not dramatic reputation but theatrical emolu∣ment ; to which, while he writes no worse than others (which can hardly be) though it should not be allowed he writes better, he presumes he is equally entitled.</P>
<P>To account for his disappointment in the present instance will not be difficult. Some just exceptions may be made to the piece itself : the scene between the lawyers in the fourth act appeared too long ; in deference however to the opinion of Mr. Colman, who thought its effect would depend greatly on the action, it was risked, and is here printed at length.</P>
<P>As to the passage objected to, on account of its supposed indelicacy, it is entirely omitted. The author must do Mr. Colman, also the justice to say, that he constantly excepted against it, and had his
<PB REF="6"/>
more cautious judgement been attended to, it would have been omitted in the representation.</P>
<P>Another exception has been made to the whole of the representation, on account of the confusion, I might say distress, of some of the performers. But if the circumstances that caused it be attended to, such performers were so far from being the objects of reprehension for playing ill, that it is a wonder they acquitted themselves so well.</P>
<P>To Mr. Macklin the author has nothing, nor ever will have any thing, farther to say, than that he im∣putes the ill success of this unfortunate comedy whol∣ly to that performer's resentment against the mana∣gers, for having discharged him the theatre ; as it was doubtless their duty to do at the requisition of the the majority of an audience. That ill-success, in∣deed has been imputed to causes, which to admit, would be to cast an injurious reflection on persons, who, the author is well persuaded, by no means de∣serve it.</P>
<P>It has been said that the gentlemen of the law took offence at the liberties taken with their profession and practice, in the characters and dialogue of Wit∣more and Nonplus. They must have too much knowledge and good sense, however, to be seriously offended at what was designed as a mere laugh on the stage, or a satire on what the best of them regret as much as their clients, without having it in their power to remedy it.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>A club of booksellers and a crew of authors are said to have formed a formidable phalanx of opposition. The writer doubts not the good in∣tentions of both ; he has endeavoured to serve the cause of literature too much, to have the good will of those, who are labouring, by every possible means, to ruin it. What injury either party might do him in the theatre, the author knows not ; but the scribblers have shewn so little discretion in the zeal to abuse him from the press, that he gives them hearty thanks for the service they have unde∣signedly done him.</P>
<P>With respect to Individuals it has been mistaken∣ly, or perhaps maliciously, propagated that the piece was calculated to ridicule persons or charac∣ters, for whom the author has either the greatest respect, or to whom he is an entire stranger. They who read Mr. Fielding's Amelia will see from what source the author has drawn some of the principal characters and incidents. As the rest of the piece is original, the candid must also admit that he has made no greater use of that writer than dramatic authors have ever been allowed to do with novel∣ists, from the practice of Shakespear to that of Mr. Colman.</P>
<P>It has been suggested, that Mr. Garrick had pri∣vately planted a party in the house to oppose the performance. This the author cannot believe ; as, having long since declared himself that gentle∣man's open and avowed enemy, he cannot, after
<PB REF="8"/>
what has publickly passed between them, think so meanly even of Mr. Garrick as to suppose he would act otherwise than as an enemy equally open and avowed.</P>
<P>It has even been said that the friends of a certain dramatist, whose name the author forbears to mention, as it is disgusting to the remembrance of his friends, were powerful in the opposition. On this head he will only give a little anecdote, as it was related to him by an auditor, who sat in the Boxes.</P>
<P>"During the tumult in the theatre about the re∣petition of the Duellist, a Lady who asked a thing that had the appearance of a gentleman, what was the reason of it, was answered that "the <HI>Man</HI> (meaning the author) was obnoxious and therefore his piece must be condemned." "Yes, madam," added a gentleman who sat by, "There are a mul∣titude of animals in this town, to whom the <HI>spirit</HI> of a MAN is as <HI>obnoxious</HI> as the <HI>person</HI> of a WOMAN."—May the author of the Duellist be ever obnoxious to such Critics.</P>
<P>Lastly, it has been urged, that the Author had not friends enough in the house to support the piece. If by this is meant that the piece had not merit enough to make itself friends, it is false, as appears from the above-cited relation. While its friends remained in the house, it was applauded by a great majority ; but, when a considerable number of these went away, and their places were supplied by riotous partizans,
<PB REF="9"/>
who could not before get into the house and had not seen it, it is no wonder that both the piece and the author should fatally feel the want of friends.</P>
<P>If this want, on the other hand, be imputed to the Author's neglect of introducing people into the theatre, to influence the judgment of the impartial part of the audience in his favour, he takes a pride in having ever paid in this respect a proper defe∣rence to the Public ; whom he should think he in∣sulted, had he acted otherwise, and made <HI>personal interest</HI> to support his pretensions to <HI>literary merit.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Too proud to beg, too modest to demand,</L>
<L>By merit only would he fall or stand ;</L>
<L>Nor enmity, nor friendship interfering,</L>
<L>He only asks a fair and candid hearing.</L>
<BIBL>Prol. to the Widow'd Wife.</BIBL></Q>
<P>This indeed is cruelly denied him, by the inter∣ruption of his play ; but he hopes will not be so on a future occasion ; the Author having another piece accepted at the same theatre ; the parts of which being already written out, and the whole ready for rehearsal, he doubts not the Manager will give him an early opportunity of repairing the loss, attending his present disappointment : Indeed he still places so much confidence on the justice and generosity of the Public, as to slatter himself he shall not ultimately suffer by trusting, without party or cabal, to the candour and impartiality of his Auditors.</P>

<L>DEAF to the bar, the pulpit, and the throne.</L>
<L>And aw'd, if aw'd, by ridicule alone,</L>
<L>The Daring Duellist, in captious pride,</L>
<L>Hath long his friend, his king, his God defied.</L>
<L>Thrice happy we, if laughter from the stage</L>
<L>Should cure this frantic folly in the age :</L>
<L>Happy the father, sister, mother, wife,</L>
<L>Who prize a son's, a brother's, husband's life,</L>
<L>Should we dethrone the tyrant, whose caprice</L>
<L>So oft endangers and destroys their peace ;</L>
<L>Whose fell despotic sway doth ev'n enslave</L>
<L>The great, the good, the generous and the brave ;</L>
<L>Nay, arrant cowards, forc'd into a fray,</L>
<L>Now fight, because they fear—to run away,</L>
<L>Our modish heroes, it is true, may bluster,</L>
<L>Take heart of grace, and all their spirits muster,</L>
<L>This peaceful reformation to oppose,</L>
<L>And take, <HI>in talk,</HI> our author by the nose.—</L>
<L>But, when the comic muse true humour fires,</L>
<L>And zeal the poignant fatirist inspires</L>
<L>Against absurdity to set his wit,</L>
<L>And folly's mark, altho' in mirth, to hit,</L>
<L><PB REF="11"/>There lies more peril in his pointed words,</L>
<L>Than lies, alack, in twenty of their swords!</L>
<L>Encouraged hence, the poet of to night,</L>
<L>Against these angry boys hath dar'd to write ;</L>
<L>For, by the way, it is on you he reckons,</L>
<L>Nature's own cause espousing, as his seconds.</L>
<L>On this presumption doth he take the field,</L>
<L>Hoping to make the stoutest blusterer yield ;</L>
<L>If silent they, who neither love nor fear him,</L>
<L>Consent to sit, and patiently will hear him,</L>
<L>If they do this, he doubts not to disperse</L>
<L>Their present prejudice for <HI>carte</HI> and <HI>tierce</HI>;</L>
<L>Their pointless swords to parry with his pen,</L>
<L>And pistol-proof, put down these mighty men!</L>

<STAGE>Mr. WITMORE <HI>and</HI> Capt. BOOTHBY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, George, your situation is so critical that I am not lawyer enough to advise you. Sir Solomon, your father-in-law, still so inflexible, say you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As positiveness and parsimony can make him. It is not above two years since I married ; and, notwithstanding every proper submission on my part, the earnest and repeated solicitations of his daughter, and the warmest intercessions of our friends, he still seems inexorable as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's strange! Time generally softens resentments of this kind. But the love of money, and an habitual passion for artificial trifles, extinguish the sparks of natural affection. As I have acquired, however some credit with him, I will try, when he comes to town, how far my influence extends. And yet, Boothby, this may be carrying my friendship for you too far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH,</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know he has a niece, who came over some time since from India to finish her education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am told he has adopted her for his daughter ; and in her favour, it is supposed, will disinherit my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In which case, if I should become her husband—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I! Why not, if the lady will have me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you any serious thoughts of Emilia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really I do think seriously of her sometimes. The month, I spent, during the last vacation at Sir Solomon's country seat, gave me an opportunity of seeing a number of good qualities in her. She is young, it is true ; but that's a fault one may easily put up with in a woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I know little of her.—Sir Solomon and his lady have strictly prohibited her having any intercourse with Mrs. Boothby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>To reconcile you, therefore, to them now, will be at least a disinterested proof of my regard for you, George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will so, and yet no greater than I expect from it. Your generosity of disposition, Witmore—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no compliments between friends.—On what terms are you with your own relation? With Lord Lovemore, and his brother-in-law, General Gantlet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the best, if I may depend on their professions. His Lordship is now exerting his interest to procure me a regi∣ment ; and, as he tells me, with confidence of success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of it—Your promotion may have a good effect on Sir Solomon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time, however, the pay of a Captain of foot, Witmore, is so disproportioned to the way of living in this gay town—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you cannot indulge in the pleasures of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, hardly subsist very creditably, and pay the court that is necessary to preferment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What think you of my laying open your circumstan∣ces to the General? He is my client, and I know you are down for something handsome in his will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I am afraid he'll not be prevailed on to part with any thing while he lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you must comfort yourself then by reflecting that cannot be long. He is so fond of duelling, that some an∣tagonist or other will soon kill him, or he will come to be hanged for killing his antagonist. He narrowly escaped the last time he killed his man, as he calls it, and yet he's as captious and quarrelsome as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is, indeed, unaccountably exceptious. But, here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>General GANTLET.</HI></STAGE>

<P>Well, Barrister, how is it? —What, George Boothby! By the lord, my boy, I am heartily glad to see thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, General. I hope I have the plea∣sure of seeing you well to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never better, my dear boy. —I have just had the superlative satisfaction of chastising a scoundrel.</P>

<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What tilting again, General?</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay don't concern thyself, my dear boy—The rogue was in luck—a simple persoration, the surgeon called it ; he tells me there is no danger.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, General, what was the cause of quarrel? How did your antagonist offend you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! Barrister! He did not offend me. —Give me thy hand, Boothby, I have done thee an injury ; which nothing but the height of friendship in me can excuse, and the most exalted sublimity of it in thee forgive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all this? How can you have so highly injured me, General? Be how it will, I promise you I forgive you with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew thou wast a good-natured lad and would overlook it, or, by the Lord, thou shouldst have taken him our thyself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, General! Have you been taking up a quar∣rel of mine :—It was obliging in you ; —but I could wish—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Sir! it's enough, I understand you, —you are perfectly in the right, I should have been more puncti∣lious. —It was impertinent in me, to be sure. —A friend may be sometimes too officious. —However, Sir, if you are dissatis∣fied, I am at your service. —Call me out—You can fight—I draw my sword for no man who dares not draw his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but understand me, General. If you have taken up any cause of mine, I am so far from resenting it as an injury, that I think myself obliged to you. You know I am as tenacious of the punctilio as yourself ; and would never be so rude as to take up the cause of a stranger : but among friends it is quite another thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, boy. When I commanded in Ireland, my doublet was pinked like the flounces of a fine lady's silk petticoat ; and all in the cause of my friends. The man who would not be run through the body for his friend, ought to be kicked out of the world for a scoundrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>An heroic sentiment, General. —But who was your antagonist? I hope, for your sake, he's really out of danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, the rascal himself, I believe, is hardly worth the care of the surgeon. I should have wiped my conta∣minated
<PB N="5" REF="17"/>
sword and left him to his fate, but that it would have been too great an honour for him to die by the hands of a gen∣tlemen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, General, I am afraid your magnanimity will one day or other betray you into the doing some rascal or other that honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, and what then? Would you insinuate that a gentleman has not a right to do himself justice by put∣ting to death a scoundrel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the laws, General?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the laws of honour, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and by the laws of the land too, if he have a mind to be hanged for it, A man may break all the laws in the statute book, if he be disposed to pay the penalties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir? shall not I annihilate a rascal? Do the laws of England afford protection to scoundrels?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a great number, noble General : and so do the laws of honour too ; by which the scoundrel has as often the advantage of the man of honour as the man of honour of the scoundrel. Let us suppose, General, that your antagonist's skill or agility had been greater than yours; would that have conferred probity on him or reflected infamy on you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Infamy on me, Sir!</P>

them? Do you think me really so blind as not to see your de∣signs on Mrs. Boothby?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Madam, while I contribute to your pleasures I expect you will not controul mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pleasures, as you call them, my Lord, are unexceptionable. I have no amusements but what are common to women of quality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I any but what are common to men of quality. In a word, Lady Lovemore, we have been too long married to impose any longer on the world, and we ought to know the world too well to impose any longer on ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what? my Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In keeping up the appearance of domestic harmony, which no longer subsists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Appearances govern the world, my Lord ; and it is they impose on themselves, who will not enjoy the shadow because they have lost the substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think we once possessed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought we married for love, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought so too : but I believe we were both mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because there has been so little lost between us, and yet there seems to be none left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The want of love, my Lord, should not ba∣nish decency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it should banish jealousy, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then your Lordship thinks me jealous, and yet you imagine there is as little love left on my side as yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The less the better, as there is no satisfying the surmizes of a suspicious woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, you are mistaken. You do it effectually by converting suspicion into certainty. I have learned to support the being an object of private neglect, but I am not quite so meek as to sit down exposed to public con∣tempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may avoid it, madam, by retiring from public notice. Our house in Gloucestershire is ready to re∣ceive you ; and, if you except to the company, I keep, in town, you may keep what company you please in the country. The post-coach shall be ready tomorrow morning, unless Mrs. Boothby makes one of our party to-night.</P>

<P>My Lord, my Lord, I will see my brother Gantlet before I determine to stay or go.</P>

<P>Your brother Gantlet, madam! Do you mean to intimidate me with your family bully? Let that blus∣terer interfere, and I will immure you in the country for life.</P>

<P>The country! And at this time of year! What cruelty? Is it possible your Lordship can be in earnest?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady LOVEMORE <HI>alone.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Barbarous tyrant! He knows, I doat upon living in town, and detest the gloomy solitude of his Gloucestershire dungeon. I will sometime or other be revenged on him for this treatment. My brother's temper indeed is so violent, that, unless things are carried to extremity, his remedy may be worse than the di∣sease. But I will dissemble with this insolent intriguer of mine ; and, if I have art enough, defeat the execution of his designs by counteracting him. —I shall be able to do this the more ef∣fectually by staying in town. —Mrs. Boothby is at present, I believe, a woman of honour, and loves her husband ; whom Lord Lovemore is flattering with favours and feeding with pro∣mises, in order to effect the seduction of his wife!

With what an air of assurance did he in fact confess it. <Q>Look you, Madam, while I contribute to your pleasures, I expect you will not controul mine.</Q> But, if Boothby and his wife are not two errant idiots, I will controul your pleasures, my fine scheming Lord, even while you think I am contributing to them. —Here, Echo!

<P>Why, look you, my Lord, as I know you may plead precedent among a number of our acquaintance, if I thought you would pay any tolerable regard to appearances, I might compound with you. It may be prudent for a neg∣lected wife to seem easy under the indifference of her husband ; but she must be meek and mean-spirited indeed, if she can sub∣mit to be insulted by his mistress.

<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>The family seems doomed, Sir Solomon, to have all its projects frustrated by the perverseness of unduti∣ful children. Your daughter threw herself away on that Captain Boothby, a young fellow not worth a groat, and here is your niece averse truly to marry governor Mammon, a man as rich as a nabob.</P>

<P>It is much, wise, that children should not take after their parents.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! she is too reasonable a woman to insist on it. A wife, Boothby, is a very troublesome mess-mate, on ship-board and in a garrison. But you will have time enough to reconcile her to so short an absence before you embark.</P>

<P>I don't pretend to it, Sir.

<P>With a due reciprocation of civilities, Sir, I must needs say that your actions bespeak it. There is, indeed, a generosity in your behaviour, that hath charmed us all, ex∣cept my niece Emmeline. I cannot think what's come to the girl ; but she's grown quite hypocondriac, as I tell her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thoughtful, perhaps, on her approaching change of condition, Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or perhaps, Governor, she expected a pre∣sent, as well as Sir Solomon and myself. We women are all a little mercenary, you know. And besides she might think it a mark of disrespect that she had none. One cannot tell— these young things, who know but a little of the world, have strange conceptions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be sorry, Madam, that Miss Emme∣line's inexperience should cause her to censure me for want of respect ; but I reserved such testimony of my regard for her, till I should have the honour of presenting it myself. This casket of diamonds—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you brought her a casket of dia∣monds then? Oh she'll brighten up at the diamonds, I'll war∣rant her. I'll send her to you immediately. —But here she is.

<P>There needs no return, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EM.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Governor, if I become your wife, in which case your present is a mere piece of gallantry : and you may almost as well take it out of one hand and put it into the other. You stile yourself my slave : but rather call me your's; for I am certain you think so.</P>

<P>Miss Emmeline!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, be not surprized. I am not now, Go∣vernor, the poor, simple girl, that was prevailed on to enter into a contract with you in India ; of which I have but late∣ly understood the impropriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, there seems to be a great al∣teration, both in your person and sentiments. But as I ad∣mire the one, I presume the other will make no alteration in the nature of our connexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EM.</SPEAKER>
<P>A groundless hope, Governor. To be plain with you, I find that women educated in England, not only be∣stow
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
their persons in marriage ; but that they have minds also, which are interested in the event of that union ; souls, Governor ; of which you Asiatic tyrants will hardly allow us women to boast the possession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Miss Emmeline, you seem to be possessed of a soul indeed, if one may judge by this speci∣men of your spirit. But as the philosophers hold the soul to be of no sex, we Asiatics, as you call us, wisely think the best part of a woman is her person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you would be mean enough to accept the hand of a woman, who had disposed of her heart to another</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look ye, madam, if a woman takes upon her to dispose of what is not her property, but has been made over to another, I don't see why the first owner may not, without the imputation of meanness, reclaim it. But is that really the case Miss Emmeline.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, governor it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have dealt disingenuously by me madam, <STAGE>[putting the casket into his pocket.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Sir? If all you require of a woman be the possession of her person, what matters it on whom she bestows her affections!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I looked on both in you as equally my pro∣perty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there, Sir! —it is just as I said—You look upon me as your property, your purchased slave ; and would doubtless treat me as such, were we married. You would be for taking me back to India, to make up the number of your Zenana, your seraglio of female favorites. But that is not in your power, Sir, were I even married to you, without my own consent. And be assured I shall never willingly leave a country in which the privileges of our sex are so well respected and secured. An English wife Governor—</P>

<P>And did she own it to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes faith she was explicit enough in all con∣science. I cannot complain of her reserve. You must find out some way, therefore, gentlemen to dissolve this same contract.</P>

<P>Impossible, Governor, without fulfilling the condi∣tion of the obligation.</P>

<P>What must I be married to such a shrew against my will?</P>

<P>O, no, Sir, on the payment of a lack of Rupees you may be excused. These are the terms of the contract, as I take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but, as I take it, that forfeiture is too considerable. I'll marry her tho' it be to have the pleasure of divorcing her the next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True Governor if that pleasure might be so soon had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it not? I understood divorces were now become as frequent in England, as in the East.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser. NON.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are pretty frequent indeed, Governor, and when the parties are agreed, are easily brought about. But if either be refractory, they are somewhat dilatory and expensive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Gentlemen, in what time and expence upon an average now, may a man by the laws of England, get rid of a refractory wife.</P>

<P>If Captain Boothby would prevent his wife's ruin and preserve his own honour, he will hinder her going to the masquerade with Lord Lovemore, or when there will most carefully watch the behaviour of his Lordship.</P>
</LETTER>
The hand-writing is a woman's, and resembles that of Lady Lovemore ; but it cannot be hers—she is to accompany my wife, and therefore would hardly dissuade me from letting her go. Besides, she seems not to have the least tincture of jealousy in her disposition—Yet now I reflect ; come this notice from whom it will, it may not be proper to neglect it. Mrs. Boothby's conduct is mysterious. Her resentment last night at Lord Love∣more's was unaffected and natural. And, though the passed off the matter slightly to day, the manner in which she did it was neither easy nor natural—There may be something more in this business than I am aware of. I will take Mrs. Boothby to task roundly for her reserve. I'll make her believe I know more than I do, that she may tell me more than I know. — Here she comes.
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Mrs. BOOTHBY.</HI></STAGE>
Come hither madam. I have something to say to you—but first let me shut the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Something to say to me! and such prepa∣ration, it must be of importance sure, Mr. Boothby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is madam. Tell me, Mrs. Boothby [taking her hastily by the hand] and tell me truly, as you value my fu∣ture quiet and your own happiness, have you dealt fairly by me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, Mr. Boothby, what do you mean? You terrify me to death by this earnestness. Dealt fairly by you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, fairly, Mrs. Boothby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Witness Heaven! that I have done it ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, call not Heaven to witness a falsehood— You have deceived me Mrs. Boothby—You have treacherously concealed from me a secret, which I ought to have known, and which, had I not by other means discovered it, might have proved our ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what falsehood? What deceit? What treachery have I been guilty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You told me to day, that you thought Lord Lovemore meant nothing by the behaviour you resented last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unkind Mr. Boothby! did not you your∣self say every thing to persuade me so? Did you not say that gratitude for the obligations his Lordship sought to confer on us, required the most favourable construction to be put on his actions!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obligations, madam! had he laid obligations on me till he had raised pile to reach the skies, the favour he sought to confer by your means, would have tumbled them all down, and buried them in oblivion. —It is in vain to conceal It any longer. This letter, this letter, madam, has given me damnable intimations of the favours intended us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all my hopes of happiness, both here and hereafter, I declare I have concealed nothing from you, but out of motives of the most sincere fidelity and affec∣tionate tenderness. I knew you to be so jealous of your honour, that I dreaded the fatal consequences of telling you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are not you, madam, equally jealous of my honour, that out of such mistaken tenderness for my personal
<PB N="59" REF="71"/>
safety, you would betray the most invaluable treasure of my soul? I Would you from so weak a motive subject me to be pointed at as the credulous dupe, the easy fool, the wittol of a titled rascal whom I caress as a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, indeed you wrong me, Mr. Boothby. Heaven forbid I should be put to the trial ; but I think I could. sacrifice every thing I hold most dear to the preservation of your honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As far as it is dependent on your fidelity, you may think it safe. The worst even a bad woman can do is to make herself ridiculous, it is on herself only that she can entail infamy. But men of honour, madam, have a degree of it to maintain, superior to that which is in a woman's keeping.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will myself, madam, be the guardian both of my own honour and of yours. I have before told you a woman's best confidant is her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you then promise to command your temper, and not be urged by that of others to violence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then will I positively confide in you ; and should his Lordship make any farther advances, acquaint you with it. And now, my dear, let me know the contents of that letter.</P>

<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read it <STAGE>[gives Mrs. Boothby the letter, and looks at her attentively while she reads it].</STAGE> Well, madam, what think you of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is the contrivance of a very artful and a very jealous woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lady Lovemore!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is her hand—though purposely dis∣guised —I am sure of it. I was before this almost tempted to

think her base enough to countenance the gallantries of her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! with her you are safe, whatever be the designs of his Lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you would have me still go to the masquerade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means; we cannot with any kind of de∣cency break the appointment without breaking at once with Lord Lovemore ; which neither good manners nor prudence will yet justify.</P>

How loose are the principles of men of intrigue! And how often do we attribute, to motives of humanity and generosity, a conduct influenced by the desire of gratifying personal vanity or mere animal appetite. —Lord Lovemore is to sunk in my esteem, that I can place no confidence in his honour. I shall so far take the letter-writer's advice, therefore, as to watch his motions to night very narrowly.
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Mrs. GOODWILL.</HI></STAGE>
Oh! Mrs. Goodwill! if General Gantlet should return I have a little plot upon him, which you must assist me in. Lady Lovemore wishes to be revenged on him for the fright he has just put her in. Now the General was duelling yesterday and wounded his antagonist : the wounds I understand are not dan∣gerous, but it will be easy for us to persuade him that they are mortal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>An excellent device, if it should but terrify him to run away! His honour and dignity would be finely mortified before he discovered the trick that was put on him.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, General, I believe you had better think of a prudent expedition to the continent. You acted the part of a man, it seems, so seriously with your antagonist yesterday, that you should be careful how you play the fool to night. I understand he lies at the point of death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! The surgeon told me he was in no danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but it seems they have called in another of more dangerous practice, and he declares otherwise. So that if the man dies, General, the lawyers, who know nothing about the point of honour, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confound the surgeons and the lawyers too—Die! let him die and be sepulchred on a dunghill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but confider, General, I would have you make off by all means, and get out of the kingdom as fast as you can.</P>

<P>Make off! What like a house-breaker or a high∣wayman! Make off!</P>

<P>Nay, General, don't be angry. —But if you stay, and matters stand as I hear them related, you will run the utmost danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it not derogatory to a man's dignity to fly from danger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If it threatened only from the point of a bayonet or the mouth of a culverin, I grant you, General. But when it appears in the form of a halter and the gallows.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. GOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, gentlemen, I am almost fright∣ened out of my wits. —Here has been two of Sir John Field∣ing's people enquiring after General Gantlet : But as I heard of the ugly affair that happened yesterday, I said his honour was not here—The servant says they are still lurking about the street. Therefore pray take care how you go out, Gene∣ral. —What a thing it would be if your honour's dignity should come to be hanged.</P>

<SPEAKER>G. GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hell and the devil! what shall I do—Not that I value my life, Capt. Boothby, of a button. I have shewn that at the head of a line of battle : but to be throttled with a halter! the indignity of it, Boothby! I shall die with shame under the indignity of it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one word! Have you so kindly invited me home not to speak to me? Will not your tongue confirm my happiness?

<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Loveinore! —Your Lordship has some grace left I see by your confusion. And so my dear Mrs. Boothby has kindly invited you home, and after all won't speak to yeu. —I will lay my commands on her, my Lord, she shall speak to you. —Come forth, Mrs. Boothby ; come forth and speak to Lord Lovemore ; his Lordship is impatient to hear the confirmation of his happiness from those charm∣ing lips. <STAGE>[Going up to door finds it locked.</STAGE>
Ha! locked! —Open the door this instant, madam, or, by

heavens I'll split it into a thousand pieces, Provoke not the rage of an injured husband, left he should be no longer able to restrain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my honour, Mr. Boothby, no injury hath been done you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps less than was intended, my Lord : but I am convinced it was not your fault that an irreparable injury is not done me. I am not so credulous, therefore, as to take your Lordship's word. Your honour, my Lord, is a bad security for your veracity. We must hear what Mrs. Boothby says to it. Come forth, I say, Madam — Mrs. Boothby!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Mrs. BOOTHBY</HI> with, <HI>Mrs. GOODWILL,</HI> from another part of the scene.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who calls me so loudly? —Mr. Boothby! <STAGE>[Lord Lovemore and Capt. Boothby look with surprize at each other.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>So soon undressed, madam! This is masque∣rading indeed! Did not you go into this room just now, in the habit, I saw you dressed in to night at the Haymarket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You forgot, my dear, that there is no other door to that room. Nor did you see me to night dressed in any habit at the Haymarket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! madam! Would you persuade me I did not know you? Did not you, Mrs. Goodwill, say my wife was gone to the masquerade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said, Sir, your Lady bade me tell you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No prevaricating, no shuffling madam! I say, my wife was to night at the masquerde.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. GOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I can answer for Ms. Boothby, Sir, that she has not been out of doors to night. —She has been
<PB N="73" REF="85"/>
conversing for some time with the gentleman and lady, you ecpected ; who are now above stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Witmore and Emilia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ms. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is even so, my dear. Being disap∣pointed of my habit, I sent to acquaint Lady Lovemore of it. who returned me word that an unforeseen accident likewise prevented her Ladyship's going. Indeed my Lord came af∣terwards to apologize for her, and pressed me so hard to ac∣company him, that, in order to get rid of his importunity, I was in a manner obliged to promise I would follow him : so that Mrs. Goodwill told you no untruth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why impose on me by equivocation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I mightoot deprive yoo of an amuse∣ment, my dear, merely because I could not partake of it my∣self, I thought you would return when you did not find me among the masks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I had found you, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the person, I suppose, to whom my habit was sent by mistake. You have no reason, I hope, to be much displeased at your disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you were prudent enough to disappoint his Lordship, I am satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is more than I am. —As Lady Love-more is at home, and Mrs. Boothby has not been abroad all the evening, you will give me leave to see who is in this room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Force open the door, then, my Lord, you con∣ducted hither the Lady who went into it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all this, Mr. Boothby?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall see presently, my dear. As yet I hardly know myself. Some demirp, I supoose, has been

quetting with Lord Lovemore : but his reason for bringing her hither is somewhat particular.</P>

<P>Come, madam, will you be pleased to un∣mask, that I may know to whom I am obliged for so many civilities? <STAGE>[The Lady unmasks.</STAGE>

<P>'Sdeath! —have I been all this while mak∣ing love to my own wife? —What a contemptible figure do I make here!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, my Lord, don't babashed. If you can be but half so gallant at home as I find you can be abroad, you may yet have no reason to repent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, madam, may have reason though to repent of this fine foolery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall never repent, my Lord, of preventing you doing what you yourself would have-much more reason to repent of. —Mrs. Boothby, I hope, will excuse my person∣ating her on this occasion, as well as the artifices I made use of, to procure her habit and detain her at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship need not apologize to me for any thing that is past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what says Lord Lovemore to what has past?</P>

<P>Nothing, Sir. I am neither disposed to ask pardon nor bear reproof. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Well said, Lord Lovemore! Carry it off like yourself. But I must have some talk with you on this bu∣siness; and that immediately too. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>What's this? Sir Solomon! my father in law!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I disclaim you, Sir. —Where is my niece Emmiline? What! would not the robbing me of a daughter content you, but you must likewise seduce my ward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you, my pretty sormal, sugitive daughter, was it not enough that you had ruined yourself, but you must assist in the ruin of your run-away cousin too? —Where is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, where is she! Let her appear this moment, or we'll call in the constables and break open the doors. She was seen to come in here.</P>

<P>How! I thought they said she was already in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! no! Sir! We stopped her, an' please your worship, as she was coming out of a chair to get into a post∣chaise, to set off for France. Had not she seemed shy of being seen, we should not have suspected her. She's very obstropu∣lous for a young lady! she won't let us see her face—so that we are sure it must be she. —Let the lady come in, there.</P>

<P>Hold, madam! my apartments are the young lady's protection.

<P>Hold, madam. Your Ladyship must excuse me, if I prevent you from exposing yourself here.</P>

<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the young lady overtaken then, Sir Solomon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, we have housed her. She's safe enough above stairs, if we can but prevail on this gentleman to part with her. Though he cares not for the authority of fathers or guardians, he may respect perhaps the prerogatives and privileges of a husband!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>A husband, Sir Solomon I Is your niece then the gentleman's wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>She must be, Sir, if I'm disposed to marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Perhaps not, Sir, if she is not so already : but here she comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Mr. WITMORE</HI> and <HI>EMILIA.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another metamorphosis! So, madam, you thought your shallow cunning could outwit your uncle's and my profound sagacity, did you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>[to Wit.] How, Mr. Witmore! Is it you that are my rival?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The young lady, Governor, hath preferred me to be her guardian ; and no violence must be offered her incli∣nations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor shall there, Barrister, on my account, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have this afternoon, Sir Solomon, been in∣formed by a relation, whom I advised of my arrival, that this young Barrister is my nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! the Governor your uncle! and you so undutiful at not to know any thing about him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>His ignorance of me is excuseable, Sir Solo∣mon : It is long since I corresponded with the family. —He may possibly have heard of me, but there have been so many Mammons of late years imported from India, that, had the name implied affinity, he might have expected a cargo of cousins by every fleet. But know me now, young gentleman, for your uncle <STAGE>[embracing him.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what is to become of our niece!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, give her to my kinsman, Madam. I really think the young lady hath provided better for herself than her friends had provided for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you resign her to him, Governor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM,</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look ye, Sir Solomon, I did not chuse to forfeit my lack of Rupees; but as the money will not now go out of the family, I can refign the lady without reluctance. So that, if you consent to their marriage, the young folks shall not be disappointed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what say you to the proposal, my lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say! Sir Solomon! What is there to be said? Governor Mammon having a right to claim Emilia for himself, he has <HI>a fortiori,</HI> as the Logicians say, a right to dispose of her to his Nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Barrister, with the Governor's leave, I don't say take her ; but, as you have got, you may keep her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir Solomon. —But to you, Sir, <STAGE>[Speaking to Governor Mammon.]</STAGE> I know not how to make my acknowledgements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. MAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we are better acquainted, Nephew, you may learn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="79" REF="91"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay—and, as you have got so good an Uncle and a wife into the bargain, Barrister, you ought to be satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not quite, Sir. You will give me leave to hope you will extend your goodness also to my friend Boothby and your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I hope for so great a blessing as your pardon, madam? <STAGE>[To Lady Bauble.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady BAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Solomon!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir SOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if it rests with me—there—there, take both our blessings between you. It is all I can spru at present, tho'; take that with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope otherwise, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, Boothby ; when favour once comes, fortune will soon follow.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter General <HI>GANTLET</HI> in his own cloathes.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>By heavens, this is not to be put up with. Bedizen'd like a strumpet, dogg'd by thief-takers, dragged along like a street-walker! —Capt. Boothby, I must have satisfaction for all this ; I understand it was a plot of yours and my lady sister's, to expose me. As to her, she is a woman, and I'll have nothing more to do with petticoats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, General, I ask your pardon with all my heart. But I acted in concert with Lady Lovemore merely to set this savage custom of duelling, you are so ab∣surdly fond of, in a ridiculous light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, I feel myself ridiculous enough in all conscience. But my dignity, Boothby!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, General! Doth dignity consist in the brutal custom of cutting throats, like cannibals, in cold
<PB N="80" REF="92"/>
blood ? Did the heroes of antiquity want dignity? Yet did Caesar ever send a challenge to Cato, or Cato to Caesar?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. GAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Caesar and Cato, Boothby, were clever fellows, in their day, no doubt. Yes, your Caesars and Catos must have been fine fellows in there time. But sword and pistol were not then in vogue, and the fight∣ing one's friends was not come in fashion. You may call me absurd, if you will ; but how is a man of honour at present to support his consequence without having recourse to the Duel ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>By having recourse to his good-nature, my dear General : Believe me, there is often more fortitude in forgiv∣ing an injury than in revenging it ; and always more dignity in despising insults than in resenting them.</P>

<BYLINE>Writen by the AUTHOR,</BYLINE>
<P>And spoken by Miss BARSANTI.</P>
<SP>
<L>WELL, men of valour! how do ye like our play?</L>
<L>Nothing against it, sure, the Ladies say! —</L>
<L>To own they're pleas'd the critics ever loth,</L>
<L>May cry "A Duellist with scarce an oath!</L>
<L>"'Tis like his hat, that was without a feather. —</L>
<L>"Duels and dammes, always go together."</L>
<L>Old sinners, loving the licentious joke,</L>
<L>May think there wants too here and there a stroke ;</L>
<L>Round oaths and double meanings, strew'd between,</L>
<L>With them the virtues of the comic scene.</L>
<L>And yet the Town in general is so nice,</L>
<L>It holds these virtues as a kind of vice.</L>
<L>From the teeth outwards chaste, their hands before 'em,</L>
<L>Like reps, ev'n demireps are all decorum.</L>
<L>Though gross their thoughts, so delicate their hearing,</L>
<L>They think the very stage should fine for swearing.</L>
<L>Our author, therefore, scrupled to employ</L>
<L>Your vulgar <HI>damme Sir,</HI> and <HI>damme boy</HI>;</L>
<L>Nay, when by chance a naughty joke came pat in,</L>
<L>He wrapt it up, you know, in lawyer's Latin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to a passage in the play, which the Author, in deference to the delicacy of certain Ladies, who understand Latin, has omitted.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>So much refin'd the scene since former days,</L>
<L>When Congreve, Vanbrugh, Wycherly wrote plays,</L>
<L><PB REF="94" MS="y"/>"The stage so loosely did Astrea tread,</L>
<L>"She fairly put all characters to bed ;</L>
<L>Tho' now no bard would venture to deposit</L>
<L>A Macaroni in a lady's closet ;</L>
<L>Lest the srail fair one he be thought to ruin,</L>
<L>While moon and stars alone—see what they're doing.</L>
<L>In the old plays, gallants take no denial,</L>
<L>But put the struggling actress to the trial.</L>
<L>B1ess me! I shudder ev'n now to think</L>
<L>How near ev'n I may stand on dangers brink.</L>
<L>In modern plays, more safe the female station ;</L>
<L>Secure as sad our solemn situation!</L>
<L>No rakish, forward spark dares now be rude :</L>
<L>The Comic Muse herself grown quite a prude!</L>
<L>No wonder then, if, in so pure an age,</L>
<L>No <HI>Congreves</HI> write for as demure a stage.</L>
