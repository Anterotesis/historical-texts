<HEAD>THE BRICKLAYER'S POEM, TO THE Countess of CHESTERFIELD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>WHAT means this dismal Sound, that March so slow,</L>
<L>This solemn Sadness, and this Pomp of Woe?</L>
<L>Why hangs that Horror on the Soldier's Mien?</L>
<L>Why droop the Multitude? What means the Scene?</L>
<L>Behold! two Victims, pale and trembling, led,</L>
<L>Already number'd with the mould'ring dead;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="025090030000030"/>What ghastly Terrors on each Brow we trace!</L>
<L>See Death imprinted on each dying Face!</L>
<L>Frail Nature bends beneath the pond'rous Woe,</L>
<L>And prone to Death would fain prevent the Blow:</L>
<L>Yet Love of Life asserts its eager Claim,</L>
<L>But Hope, alas! affords no flatt'ring Gleam.</L>
<L>Lo! the pale King in horrid Pomp appears!</L>
<L>What cruel Eye could then refrain from Tears?</L>
<L>What Heart relentless, then, forbear to melt?</L>
<L>Who saw their Sorrows, but like Sorrows felt?</L>
<L>How sad the Conflict! how severe the Strife</L>
<L>Of Wretches, clinging to the Verge of Life!</L>
<L>When angry Justice claim'd her destin'd Prey;</L>
<L>And frown'd, vindictive, on the kind Delay:</L>
<L>(Thy saving Mercy, in that Moment flew,</L>
<L>The darling Attribute of Heav'n and You):</L>
<L>To soft Compassion won thy willing Lord,</L>
<L>His Justice temp'ring sheath'd th' uplifted Sword.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="025090030000040"/>And in that fearful, that tremendous Hour,</L>
<L>Snatch'd the pale Victims from th' offended Pow'r.</L>
<L>As when by adverse Stars or Chance misled,</L>
<L>Entic'd by Lucre, or pursu'd by Dread,</L>
<L>A Wretch from some high Rock's stupendous Brow,</L>
<L>Hangs o'er the Waves, and dreadful Depths below.</L>
<L>The slender Bough he grasps, his only Stay,</L>
<L>Yields to his Weight, and more and more gives way;</L>
<L>Of Hope abandon'd, as the Branch he tears,</L>
<L>He views th' Abyss, and, as he views, despairs,</L>
<L>'Till some unhop'd for Hand prevents his Doom,</L>
<L>Lifts him to Life, and lengthen'd Years to come:</L>
<L>Redeem'd from Fate, nor yet restor'd to Life,</L>
<L>They wond'ring pause, and feel a doubtful Strife;</L>
<L>If still on Earth they breathe with human Race,</L>
<L>Or mix with Shades in Death's obscure Embrace;</L>
<L>'Till dawning Hope the dubious Horror clears,</L>
<L>Confirms their Safety, and dispels their Fears:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="025090030000050"/>Loud Shouts of Triumph waft Thy Name on high,</L>
<L>And STANHOPE'S Goodness fills the vaulted Sky.</L>
<L>Oh! hadst Thou Pow'r afflicted Realms to spare,</L>
<L>And rescue <HI>Europe</HI> from the Waste of War,</L>
<L>Fell Rage and Discord at thy Nod should cease,</L>
<L>And all Mankind enjoy the Sweets of Peace.</L>
<L>Then human Blood should deluge Earth no more,</L>
<L>But Leagues of Commerce stretch from Shore to Shore.</L>
<L>You like the Dove the friendly Branch would bring,</L>
<L>And blooming Olives in each climate spring;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/> golden Age the guilty Globe shou'd see,</L>
<L>And <HI>Scotia</HI> faithful as <HI>Hibernia</HI> be.</L>
<L>No Feuds intestine in <HI>her</HI> Bosom jar,</L>
<L>No Breath rebellious wakes the Trump of War.</L>
<L>Her martial Tribe a loyal Fervour feels,</L>
<L>And Virtue's Strength each manly Bosom steels.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="025090030000060"/>For Truth and Freedom firmly they unite,</L>
<L>And stand resolv'd to tempt the hardy Fight.</L>
<L>Thy STANHOPE'S Presence shall each Breast inspire,</L>
<L>And GEORGE's Glory set their Souls on Fire</L>
