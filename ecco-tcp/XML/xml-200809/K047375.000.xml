<P>Here comes Signor Lopez, head man to the Chief Inquisitor of the province, Don Miguel de Lara. Stand back, stand back, and pay your humble obedience to him. <STAGE>(They fall back, and bow to <HI>Lopez</HI> as he enters.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Save you, save you. <STAGE>(They bow again.)</STAGE> Ah, that will do; that is quite enough, good peo∣ple.
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
It is really a tormenting thing to be a man of such consequence. I don't wonder now, that the Eastern monarchs suffer themselves to be seen so seldom; for, in good truth, the homage that attends greatness is very troublesome to men of indolent habits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to see your Honour look so well to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you—thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope that your Honour likes these parts, and that you be not displeased with the folk here∣about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as to these parts, honest Diego, they are pleasant enough. Valencia is a pretty province; but for the neighbourhood, my good fellow, that, you must suppose, is most diabolical to a man like me, used not only to the society of Madrid, but who have lived in London and Paris. You may well conceive how wretched is my condition, if you consider that, with all my ta∣lents and information, I am sometimes forced, for want of better company, to come and sit a whole hour with such a bumpkin as you. It is hard, is n't it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry we entertain you so badly; but we do our best, and always feel your company a vast honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I consider, and therefore put up with all deficiencies. I am reasonable, and know how to make allowances. Pray have you seen the two strangers to-day, that have been in the neigh∣bourhood the last fortnight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Signor Lopez.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whimsical gentlemen! They make free—seem to feel themselves quite at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>What countrymen are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>What countrymen? Oh, Diego, your
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
ignorance of men and manners!—Can any country but one, produce men mad enough to play such wild tricks in his Most Catholic Majesty's sober dominions, and in full sight of the habitation of an Inquisitor? No, no, Diego; Englishmen are the only people who never consider change of place, but are just the same harum-scarum mad∣caps in all parts of the world as they are at home: quite as ready to make an uproar in the court of the Great Mogul, as to break a lamp within the liberties of Westminster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not understand that these strangers were both from the same country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did not understand!—My dear Diego, you should only listen, and let other peo∣ple understand for you! Mark me—You are of the kingdom of Valencia, I of Castille—yet we are both Spaniards.—So one of these strangers is of England, the other of Ireland; which though dif∣ferent islands, yet the natives of both own one country—one king—and (this in your ear, Diego) will, with one heart, defend their country and king against all the rest of the world.—Here come two miserable-looking Hidalgos—fellows, that live in dirt and poverty, from the fear of de∣basing their noble descent, by honestly earning a whole coat and a good meal.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Two Hidalgos enter with great stateliness, and the appearance of extreme poverty.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Save you, save you. <STAGE>(They return no answer, but look at him with great contempt, and exeunt.)</STAGE> These are precious vermin: the most wretched paupers, with the pride of princes.—How soon must the nation go to ruin where it is reckoned dishonour∣able to be industrious! They have a different me∣thod
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
of considering matters in the country I was just talking of. Instead of seeing, as we do here, nobility made ridiculous by its entailing on future generations laziness and poverty, in England you will find some of its most stately branches raised from the stock of honest industry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is coming yonder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey!—Oh! it is one of the strangers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>He seems hurt or sick—his servants are wheeling him along in a chair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is only one of his mad whims. He fancies himself in a consumption, and went to Lisbon for the recovery of his health—there he fell in love, and is now searching through Spain for his mistress, whose relations suddenly conveyed her from Portugal. Disappointment has increased his nervous fancies, and with stamina to last a cen∣tury he believes that he sha'n't exist a month. This is the one from Ireland—he is called Sir Sturdy O'Tremor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Signor Lopez, time presses—I must look to my work.</P>
</SP>

<P>That is right.—Farewell, honest Diego.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gently, gently, you scoundrels!—Oh, the Devil fetch you, you have not a spark of com∣passion for your poor dying master. There! stop, stop; let me rest a morsel.—Oh, it is all over with me!—Even this little bit of a motion is too great a fatigue for my worn-out frame. Come hither,
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Pat.—Now, Pat,—on your conscience tell me, don't I look like a corpse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my faith, your Honour, it must be a corpse that died of a scarlet fever then—for your gills look as rosy as Father O'Flanagan's, when he has tossed off the fourth bottle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Starting up in a rage, and seizing him.)</STAGE> You unfeeling brute! to make a joke of your mas∣ter's infirmities.—I'll shake you to atoms, you dog! <STAGE>(He shakes him, and then sits down again.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pat.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Saint Patrick you have a pretty tight grip for a corpse. <STAGE>(Walking away angrily.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be an Irishman in a consumption, Heaven keep me from the clutches of one in full health and strength!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE><HI>(Seeing</HI> Lopez.)</STAGE> There is a stranger; he can have no interest in deceiving me.—Step this way, my good fellow; I suppose you can read in my looks, that I am not a man long for this world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> I have just gained a practical hint for my behaviour; so I know how to humour you.—Why, Sir, I am sorry to say I can't flatter you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are an honest fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not but I am perfectly aware that some persons might mistake that ruddy complexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a mere flush—a melancholy symp∣tom—a hectic glow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is just what I supposed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as for my figure, did you ever see such a poor miserable spectre?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Lord!—Oh Lord! <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>—As you say, Sir—your figure—but you know, Sir, on that point I am unable to speak accurately, not having seen you otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then it will surprise you to be told that I was once—a stout, able▪bodied man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Sir, I am very much in∣clined to believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed; and instead of this little bit of a pipe, I once had a voice like thun∣der.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can readily imagine; for, to say the truth, it still conveys no faint idea of that sound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes—I am all faint, all feeble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Without.)</STAGE> You lazy beggars! I will put a little motion into you; I'll make you active against your wills. <STAGE>(He enters, fighting with the two Hidalgos.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Starting up.)</STAGE> Two to one—fair play, you spalpeins! <STAGE>(He rushes on one of them, trips him up, and seizes his sword at the same time that <HI>Dash∣ington</HI> disarms the other.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a poor feeble dying man!—If I stay, I shall certainly laugh in his face; so I will take myself hence while I am safe. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To the fallen Hidalgo.)</STAGE> Away, Sir!—follow your companion; and learn, that to afford assistance to females in distress is an action that, instead of being beneath a gentleman, a prince may be proud of. <STAGE>[Exit second Hidalgo.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>What occasioned this encounter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>But first let me seat myself, or I shall sink to the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! While a man can sink others to the earth with such ease, he is not in much danger of sinking there himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear Dashington! you don't know my complaints.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and, what is still better, you don't know them yourself.—But to my story. I saw, at a distance, moving along at the solemn
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
stately pace accordant with Spanish dignity, an old lumbering vehicle, that looked as if it had been a present from the city of London of one of their cast-off lord-mayor's coaches. The coach∣man was very comfortably enjoying his <HI>siesta</HI> on the box. Well, on it paced for some time, as orderly and slowly as if it had been in a proces∣sion; when, unluckily, a bed of clover on the road-side tempting the steeds to deviate from the beaten track, down went the carriage into an ugly kind of a hollow: I heard the screams of wo∣men, and flew to their assistance. Those fellows were passing, whose aid I required to raise the carriage. The beggarly rascals, considering such employment a degradation, insolently refused. I however effected my purpose, without their help, and fortune throwing them again in my way, I was determined to pay them what I thought they deserved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh the vagabonds! I wish I had been with you—not that, in my feeble state, I could have rendered any service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I think you could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no—it is all over with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, quite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a pity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>No power on earth could enable me to rise from this chair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, yes, and I think you might even be brought to take a little walk with me, only for a mile or so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mile or so! Not there paces, if it were to gain me the wealth of both Indies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so; I know you are not covet∣ous; but beauty, angelic beauty, might allure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I am in a pretty state for beauty to have any effect on me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then your case is hopeless, indeed. I am heartily sorry for it, and I'll tell Jaquelina!</P>
</SP>

<P>Eh! what did you say of Jaquelina? <STAGE>(Turning towards <HI>Dashington</HI> very actively.)</STAGE></P>

<P>I said I should tell Jaquelina.</P>

<P>Ah! you mean if you should happen to see that dear creature after I am dead.</P>

<P>I only mean that you must die in a devil of a hurry, for I am to see Jaquelina in a few hours.</P>

<P>What do you mean by another time? <STAGE>(Walking after him impatiently.)</STAGE></P>

<P>My dear friend, you'll fatigue yourself to death. You know you could not walk three paces for the wealth of both Indies.</P>

<P>I'd walk <HI>to</HI> both Indies to see Jaque∣lina. Where is she, my dear friend?</P>

<P>Feeble! I am as stout as a lion.</P>

<P>I knew I should work a miracle. Now learn that Jaquelina, who was so suddenly re∣moved from your sight at Lisbon, was in the very

carriage which overturned this morning. I had her in my arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>And let me take you in my arms, my dear friend! for you have raised me from the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>But calm your ecstasy: she is confined by bolts and bars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a convent—and, what is worse, she fears that she is soon to take the veil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll set fire first to every convent in Spain, in defiance of the Inquisition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you may obtain her by less violent means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Stur.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, how, my dear friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you shall know with all expedition. The ladies who were in the carriage with her were so terrified at the accident, that they were a long time before they recovered their senses: so, while they obligingly continued fainting, we had op∣portunity to lay plans for her escape.</P>

<STAGE>A Wood, with a Cottage.</STAGE>
<STAGE>LOPEZ <HI>enters.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Surely my master, Don Miguel de Lara, is the last man in the world that I should have suspected of accepting a post in the Holy Office. He used to be the most friendly, good-humoured old fellow in all Spain: what then could induce him to become an Inquisitor? He is mightily altered, and yet, somehow, the change is only superficial. He frowns at every body, and hardly speaks a kind word; but I have reason to think his heart is as humane as ever. He has sent me to seek out a melancholy being who, as he understands, chooses to live in this lonely place. A man can't be void of tenderness who courts the society of the unfortunate.—This must be the person I am sent to—I'll observe him a little, before I accost him.</P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>ALPHONSO,</HI> from the Cottage.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now to my painful task, of seeking commerce with that hated being man, to pur∣chase means of eking out a life of wretchedness. Were I not forced by nature's wants to the de∣tested intercourse, I might be sheltered in this friendly solitude from the sight my eyes abhor, and my heart sickens at—a human face. <STAGE><HI>(Lopez</HI> comes forward.)</STAGE>—Ha! What! hunted to my very den! No beast of prey is chased by man with such unwearied ardour as he pursues his fellow.</P>
</SP>

<P>My master sent me, Sir. Good Hea∣vens! I surely know that face. My Lord Al∣phonso!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my hated name! Have I then fled to this secluded spot, seeking to shun the sight of man; but most of all to hide me from their view who knew me in my days of happiness; and must I still meet eyes that in this wretched being trace Alphonso?—But to your errand: your master sent you; who is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chief of the Inquisition of Valencia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! is that tribunal grown impolitic in cruelty, to seek a wretch like me to wreak its vengeance on? Those who delight in human misery should single out the happy, and force the groan of anguish from the heart that ne'er knew aught but rapture: I am so pre-eminent in wretch∣edness, that I can look with tranquil eye on all the horrors of the infernal court—misnamed the Holy! Can its gloomy caverns terrify the man who loaths the sight of day? can eternal silence be a punish∣ment to him to whom all converse with mankind is hateful? or can the flames which fold around the victim of its wrath, equal the fire which burns within my bosom? No, no; the flames which kin∣dle at the stake, possess the mercy too to counteract the vengeance that employs them, and soon con∣sign the sufferer to eternal peace; while here, here in this tortured heart, a fire more painful rages, and yet will not destroy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mourn the cause of your distress, my Lord, whatever it be; but I was sent to you to bear the greetings of my master, and express his wish for your society:—knowing you only by re∣port, as one who seemed of noble bearing, and unhappy; but when he shall find it is the Count Alphonso—</P>

<P>Ay, marriage was my shame! my tor∣ment!

A few weeks absence lost me this treasure; and to a stran∣ger, the acquaintance of a day, she gave her heart:

<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk not thus idly. The world!—she was the world to me, and now she is lost, the link is snapped that bound me to creation: the various passions which possess the human heart, and point to different objects, were in mine directed all to her. Did I court honours? 'twas to lavish them on Angelina; did wealth seem worth possessing? 't was that Angelina might command whatever wealth could purchase; did I seek the circles of the gay? it was that she might not know a pause from pleasure; for all to me was irksome that com∣pelled one thought or look to be withdrawn from her—Leave me; and by the regard which you profess, report me to your master, not as Alphonso, but as a wretched, nameless being, to whom man can do no kindness but in shunning him, as he shuns all mankind. <STAGE>[Exeunt▪</STAGE></P>

<P>A hard kind of a service this of mine, to be watch▪dog to a convent; and spite of all my care, I am afraid, at last, I shall lose some of my lambkins.

Here comes a reverend father! This is

the only set of men I a'n't afraid of. Not because I think that holiness alway lies under a hood; but be∣cause these father confessors being trusted with the sins of their female acquaintance, why it is fair to imagine, that if they are ever disposed to sin them∣selves, they need not go out of their own neigh∣bourhood to indulge their inclinations.</P>

<P>You did, did you? Then let me tell you, that if you come to me for justice, you shall see her in open daylight; for though she is blind her∣self, she is not ashamed of being viewed by the whole world; and those who pretend that she likes darkness best, are desirous to palm off some base counterfeit in her place: so let the witnesses stand forward, and bring in the accused.</P>

<P>Who am I? My friend, you seem to have changed places with me: that may be a very proper question from the judge to the prisoner, but I never heard of its being put by the prisoner to the judge. So be so kind as to tell me who are you?</P>

<P>There, you see the gentleman did not go on his own account, but merely to assist a friend. Well, so you and your friend, between you, have contrived to carry away a few young ladies from the convent?</P>

<P>Very true; but you know an ill name goes a great way with prejudiced people; and let a man be as valiant as Caesar, and as fine a gentle∣man too, only call him robber instead of con∣queror, and all his good qualities go for nothing.</P>

smooth smiling face; but by one with a pair of frowning brows, and fierce mustachios.—The wea∣pon that wounded me, was not a sparkling eye, but a damned long sharp toledo; and instead of being prevented from observing my appointment, by the act of breathing out my soul from my lips, it was hurrying very fast out of my body, from a hole that a friend of yours did me the kindness to drill through me.</P>

<P>To my shame, I own, by my indiscretion. You remember at our last meeting, you kindly fixed the day on which you would explain to me all the particulars of your situation, and fly with me from Spain.</P>

<P>Business in the mean time called me some miles from Madrid.—I however posted with a lo∣ver's speed to observe the appointment—a violent storm, which though I was disposed to brave, not all my efforts could persuade my steed to encoun∣ter, obliged me to seek shelter at an inn. There I found a <HI>certain</HI> gentleman, likewise weather-bound. Observing my anxiety to proceed on my journey, he inquired the cause.—I foolishly revealed it—on which he furiously called me villain, bestowed some hearty curses on you, Ma'am,—so to tilting we went—and as it happened, he left me, to all ap∣pearance, not likely to be any man's rival in future.</P>

<P>O Lord, O Lord! I have brought my adventures to a pretty catastrophe. Oh, what a cursed blockhead have I been, to play such pranks in a country where there is this odious, horrible Inquisition!—A pretty figure I make, with their cursed jacket of flames and devils!—
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
But I wish that were the worst part of the business. If they would let me out alive, and with whole bones, I would be contented to do penance in this pretty vestment, up St. James's Street and Bond Street, for the rest of my life. Nay, that would be no punishment, for I dare swear, as soon as this queer coat was seen there, it would be thought ugly enough to come into fashion. All my fine women, too, in compliment to me, would dress <HI>à l' Inquisition;</HI> and for a whole season, at least, nothing would be voted stylish that was not of the devil and bonfire pattern.—But here am I lodged in this black hole, and my only <HI>promenade</HI> will be to a bundle of faggots, where I and my jacket will be turned into cinders and tin∣der.

whose dear remembrance her faithful bosom che∣rishes, while he may have abandoned her, and heape such anguish on that heart, as falsehood hath lodged here. Let me behold the face of her whose sorrows I conceive akin to mine. Immortal powers! Has madness mastered my poor tortured brain, and do my eyes act as the vassals of distem∣pered fancy? or has just Heaven, thus by a mi∣racle, directed the guilty Angelina to her wronged husband, to enforce the vengeance due to her crime? <STAGE>(Pauses.)</STAGE> All surrounding objects are reflected to my sense with truth's distinctness.—Can I err only here? No, no! 'Tis she, and sent, that death, death by his hand she hath wronged, may expiate her perfidy. Why does my heart shrink from an act of justice? How misery dis∣arms resentment! Yes, yes; 'tis that unnerves me. Did I behold her in the hall of splendour, decked in the robes of gaiety, her eyes sparkling with bliss, then should I rush eager for vengeance, and exult to lay triumphant guilt in ruin. But here I view a wretched creature whom Heaven's hand hath humbled. Is that pale cheek, where sufferance is marked with care's sure traces—is that a stimulant to vengeance? Poor ill-fated girl! Thy heart has played thee treacherously—it wanted firmness to prevent thy falsehood, and yet has not been slack to upbraid thee with it.

No—the cursed tongue that lured you to dishonour, that tongue pronounced the infernal truth, and—be∣came dumb for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then justly did a villain perish; for if ever the tongue of mortal could truly charge me with an act, however trivial, or one word or look, that spoke my heart wandering from thee, may Heaven withhold from me its mercy, and let the fiercest pangs that dying sinners tremble at, be my eternal lot! Oh, my Alphonso, spurn not, as faithless, her whose dearest, only joy, has been thy love; her who, if all the world combined to load thee with its hate, would still cling to thee with in∣creasing fondness; and who, if miseries pressed on thy brain too great for reason to support, would tend thee in the cell of madness, and even there derive more ecstasy from one kind look given in the transient intervals of sense, than all the un∣ruffled
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
pleasures that the world without thee can afford!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Oh, how finely does woman's glowing fancy picture the charms of con∣stancy, while her warm bosom mocks the ideal bliss, and burns for each new lover! Angelin—Woman—Woman, I say—No arts, no well-ima∣gined fiction of pure faith—no tears—no, not the genuine drops of true repentance, which atone some crimes, can a crime undo. Truth has pro∣claimed thy perfidy—my ears, which heard the horrid tale, are shut to denial and to palliation.—My heart is chilled—heart said I? No, no, that I long since gave you—you despised the worthless gift, and threw it from you; but it has ne'er re∣turned to warm this bosom—No, all here is cold as death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cruel Alphonso! Turn your remembrance to our past affection. Think on the days—the years we have lived together—Could love like mine be feigned? Oh, were our dear children here, they would surely waken some tenderness for their poor mother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Angelina! <STAGE>(Endeavouring to suppress his tears.)</STAGE> Shame on this weakness! but think not, though my eyes betray a sympathy with misery, that my soul can sympathize with guilt, or that the sacred compact of affection plighted to purity, shall remain firm to falsehood. To chain the living to the dead, is not to nature more repugnant, than to link honour with pollution.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sister's; and to my shame I own, from apprehension that she would disapprove my con∣duct, it was without her knowledge I received you.</P>

<P><STAGE><HI>(To</HI> Angelina.)</STAGE> My dear Ma'am, I beg you a million of pardons; and, my dear Sir, not∣withstanding you made a lunge clean through me, I confess you have great reason to be offended: but you see it was all a mistake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alph.</SPEAKER>
<P>But whence could this mistake arise? Leonora would never, surely, in her sister's name, receive the visits of a lover!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dash.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; she admitted my visits under no name at all, and obliged me too to promise not to make inquiries. Her commands I punctually obeyed; but at our last interview, as I was quitting the house, I heard a passer-by exclaim, "There lives the beauteous Angelina d'Esparza!"
