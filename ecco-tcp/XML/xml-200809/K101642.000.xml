<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY WILLIAM THOMAS FITZGERALD, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AND SPOKEN BY MR. MURRAY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>TO please the town is not a task severe,</L>
<L>Wit will command a smile, distress a tear!</L>
<L>And he, whose moral picture plainly shews</L>
<L>The tree of vice can bear no fruit but woes!</L>
<L>That, tho' successful long in fashion's reign,</L>
<L>The villain's wages are disgrace and pain;</L>
<L>But that the good, by bounty wisely given,</L>
<L>Can make this vale of tears resemble heav'n!</L>
<L>With new-born comfort hush the widow's sigh,</L>
<L>And wipe the tear from pallid mis'ry's eye!</L>
<L>The Bard, who thus employs his useful pen,</L>
<L>Imprints his drama on the hearts of men;</L>
<L>Commands respect from age, applause from youth,</L>
<L>And makes the stage assist the CAUSE OF TRUTH.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, has an author many an anxious fear,</L>
<L>As his probationary night draws near:</L>
<L>When to his friends the manuscript is read,</L>
<L>Each social critic nods the approving head;</L>
<L>Most yield him flatt'ry—some with jaundic'd eye</L>
<L>Glance at a fault, and at a beauty sigh.</L>
<L>But these are few—true genius still delights</L>
<L>To gaze with rapture at the Muse's slights!</L>
<L>And scorns to triumph at a brother's fall,</L>
<L>When Fame's wide dome is large enough for <HI>all!</HI></L>
<L>Tho' none shall mount where Shakspeare sits sublime▪</L>
<L>The drama's monarch to the end of time!</L>
<L>Within that fane they each a wreath may wear,</L>
<L>Which nature's darling offspring hallow'd there—</L>
<L>And seated at the base of Shakspeare's throne,</L>
<L>Feel some small portion of his fire their own!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, if they knew their int'rest, wits wou'd be</L>
<L>By friendship bound in one great family;</L>
<L>And, if deserving, all might reap the bays</L>
<L>From the rich harvest of the Public praise.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY JEMIMA.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Very pleasant, sociable companion, indeed, Mr. Visorly! can you pore over newspapers at no other time? You compliment me most highly in letting me see that, while you are in my company, you need other entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, I beg your pardon. One is anxious, you know, for the good of one's country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are anxious, Mr. Visorly, for any thing that is to shew disrespect to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord how you talk—I shew disrespect to you! <STAGE>(still reading.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>There! are you not still inattentive to me and my remonstrances? Ah! I might have known what I had to expect. This is the conse∣quence of losing sight of what was due to my birth and rank, and marrying a commoner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lady Jemima, why shou'd you urge that so often? I am sensible of the honor, and of my own unworthiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still you pay no attention to what I
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
am complaining of. Any thing, I find, is prefer∣able to my conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never spoke a truer word in her life <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> My dear, I shall have done in a moment—I am among the deaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to the Lord you were.</P>

<SP>

<P>You would provoke the patience of a saint. <STAGE><HI>[OLD VISORLY</HI> starts up, he has been still reading.]</STAGE> What is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tol lol de rol! <STAGE>(singing and capering.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The man is mad.</P>

<P>Frenzy, my dear! only the frenzy that arises from good news.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't you give utterance to your good news without such absurdity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I will, my dear, <STAGE>(reads)</STAGE> "On Thursday, the 14th of last March, died at an advanced age, at Calcutta in Bengal"—Tol lol de rol!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, mad, mad!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>"John Cleveland, Esq.—his immense wealth devolves on his only son, who is shortly expected in England." There is a fortune for our dear son, Leonard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean for our Leonard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Cleveland, the son and heir of the deceased, is my first cousin—I'm his nearest of kin—The old fellow, who is dead, was such a capricious sort of animal, that he might have left every shilling of it away from his own son; but now it is come into his possession, it is in the fair road to our family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, indeed, is welcome news;—and here comes our dear Leonard to partake it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<HI>Enter</HI> LEONARD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear boy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear son!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morning—How do you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is news!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my boy, we have news for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Mr. Visorly—I'll tell it him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll save you the trouble—Old Cleveland is dead at Calcutta—his son inherits all his for∣tune—And the good news is, that their <HI>bulses</HI> and <HI>lacks</HI> may eventually come to our family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, my boy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Leonard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not give five guineas for the chance of inheritance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I know a little more of the cir∣cumstances than you do. Mr. Cleveland has a daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poh, poh! some—some—you under∣stand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Visorly, I am shocked at your indelicate allusions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish they were well grounded; but 'tis a melancholy fact, that the daughter is legitimate, and her mother, Cleveland's wife, is living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear me, dear me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the most positive information.—Cleveland's own acknowledgement. He has written to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—Stating that as we were the nearest, and only male relations he had, to us he has taken the liberty of consigning his remittances—with directions how he wishes them to be invested. Understanding that your residence in London was only casual, and also thinking the trouble of business more suited to my time of life, he thought it better to address his letter to me. In it, he ex∣plains all the particulars of his marriage; and recommends his wife and daughter to our at∣tention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>How—are they not with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. His daughter we may hourly ex∣pect—Not being able to settle his affairs immedi∣ately on the death of his father, he sent her before him, unwilling to detain her from her mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, is the mother in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes;—and has been for several years. His marriage was without the consent of his father, and, for some time, unknown to him—Enraged when he discovered it, he insisted on a separation,—to avoid ruin, which would have been the con∣sequence of his father's resentment, he was forced to comply. The child was suffered to remain with him—The wife was doom'd to return to England, where, for these fifteen years she has lived in retirement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what is to be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are recommended, it seems, to our attention; but, really, I don't well see how I can reconcile to myself, taking notice of, and introducing to my acquaintances, people, one doesn't know who—and that have been living one doesn't know where,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you talk of? Are they not the
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
wife and daughter of a nabob? Your high-bred friends will worship you for the introduction. Think what will be the magnificence of their house, the splendour of their equipage, the bril∣liancy of their entertainments. Such suppers as theirs will be the fashionable world would scram∣ble for a seat at, even if they were given by a personage from a hotter place than Bengal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leonard says very truly. We shall get credit by shewing such gold pheasants to our friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly: for all will be charmed with the splendour of their plumage—even those who are so little fashionable as not to attempt plucking the feathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we must prepare to shew them all possible civility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, pray let us; for I have something in view that will pay us for our trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hope of making the young lady a part of our family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an excellent thought! Ah, Leo∣nard, Leonard, you are a cunning rogue!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>You amaze me, child, that you don't extend your views—My son, the grandson of the earl of Castlegreat, ought to aspire to the proudest heiresses of the noblest peers—not stoop to a thing of mushroom growth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, mother, <HI>this</HI> mushroom is the growth of a golden soil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, son, pursue your own inclina∣tions; my affection for you will always make me yield to your wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then this glorious fortune may be mine. Invite them to your house. The mother having
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
long experienced a constrained seclusion from so∣ciety, will, doubtless, be gratified with attentions from a woman of your rank—the daughter is young—I don't despair of success with her; and the preference the father has shewn, in the trust con∣signed to me, makes me hope every thing from him. So, all seems fair for my success; and half a million at least is the prize. Think of that—think of that.</P>

<P>Don't she? Why, then, Lady Jemima is a lady just after my own heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir—you come concerning Mr. Cleveland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oakw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, Sir; yes. You must know, Sir, that I am an old fellow that remember Mrs. Cleveland (Heaven bless her!) when she was not the height of my knee. Often and often is the time that I have danced her o'top of it. Well, that is neither here nor there. When her father
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
died—Ah! I shall never forget it—he has not left a better man behind him—there was not a dry eye in the village except the undertaker's, and folks do say he cried a bit. Well, her father, good soul! had met with so many losses and crosses, that there was little enough left for his daughter to live like a lady on; so she was persuaded by her friends to take a voyage to India with a cousin of her's, who had married, and was going to settle there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Cleveland has acquainted me with the rest. There he married her, and from thence, by the severity of his father, he was forced to send her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oakw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, poor dear! home she came again, miserable enough, to be sure. Well, mayhap, all for the best; now she will be as happy as the day is long. But for this many a year she has led but a lonesome sort of a life; for you may think my dame and I, though we love her like a child of our own, can't have been company good enough for her: but she was as kind to us, and made as much of us, as though we had been the best people in the land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Jem.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall soon, I hope, have the pleasure of receiving her in this house. She must not think of seeing any other habitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, certainly not. She must make this her abode.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Vis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, to be sure; to be sure.</P>

<SPEAKER>Oakw.</SPEAKER>
<Q REND="margQuotes">Why, do you know, now, this is the very thing that came into my head, and that I told her of—Says I, as sure as I am a sinner, if those relations of Mr. Cleveland's have the least bit of kind-heartedness about them, they'll never let you live in any house but their own.</Q>
</SP>

What, though it has been the means of effecting the ruin of a few thoughtless profligates? There vices were incurable, and they would have been as completely beggared by the skilful operations of others if all my thoughts had been engaged in the exercise of devotion, and my guineas appropriated to charitable donations—Nay, to preserve my estimation with the world, I have raised from the earth those whom others, less mindful of opinion, would have left groveling in misery.—Psha! when I scrutinize my conduct with an eye half inclined to condemnation, I find matter for praise instead of censure. Dupes will be dupes—Knaves will make their prey of them—and lucky is the dupe that becomes the prey of a knave with some conscience, and a great regard for a good reputation. Whom have we here?</P>

<P>I request you will save yourself that trou∣ble: my conscience is a charge of which I choose to have the sole guardianship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is my duty to inquire whether thou hast treated that precious charge like unto a faith∣ful guardian—Whether thou hast not stained with guilt, that which was consigned to thy care spot∣less and pure; and which now goads thee with complainings for thy iniquity. Therefore, I say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall say no more in this house. Out with you directly <STAGE>(offering to push him out).</STAGE></P>

<P>Oh, Leonard, Leonard, is this the way you treat an old friend, after so long an absence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>An old friend!—What do you mean? Who are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And so, my reverend appearance has con∣cealed from your recognition your friend, and brother in iniquity, Jeremy Sharpset!</P>

<P>Sharpset!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is the meaning of this trans∣formation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The restlessness of my disposition, and inclination for any pursuit in preference to laudable exertion, and honest industry.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I confess it—You were very ser∣viceable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I was. I did the roguery, and you received the profits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come—You were not ill paid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no—I don't complain. How is poor Drooply?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still the creature of my bounty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that is kind of you—A generous weakness in your character—You swindled him out of two thousand a year, and are good enough to allow him a hundred. Ah, you are a model of philanthropy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, a truce with your sarcasm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, bless your honest tender heart! He is as grateful to you as ever, I conclude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he esteems me his friend and pre∣server.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor fellow! "He was wont to set the table in a roar, now quite chop-fallen." I declare I never think of him but with a heart-ache.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well—but what have you been do∣ing since we parted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>All sorts of things I ought not to do. To confess the truth, the reason I quitted you, was, I was tired of the work you chalked out for me—You wanted to push me a little farther in roguery than I liked. I am but a petty larceny villain—That ruin of poor Drooply, in which I was the chief engine for you—that hit me hard. I am foolish enough to have qualms. I know you despise me for it; but we all have our weaknesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; but what became of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you. I had unluckily, once in my life, dined at a Lord Mayor's feast.—I shall never forget it. Talk of Earls and Dukes en∣tertaining!—Psha! a rivulet to the ocean. Ever after I panted for City honours—So, all my <HI>honest</HI> earnings I was determined to deposit in trade. An opportunity soon offered—I was to become a sleeping partner in a great house. I paid down my cash to the last guinea—A docket was struck against the firm the very next week, so the poor sleeping partner had nothing but the open air for his slumbers; and, instead of being in the road to claim a seat at a Guildhall dinner, I had scarcely enough to purchase one in Porridge Island.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, all your hopes of a gold chain va∣nished?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and I was in a very likely way to be adorned with an iron one;—but I was resolved to take myself out of the reach of temptation and danger, by leaving London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what capacity did you travel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still I had a taste for partnership. I en∣gaged with a very respectable Gentleman to divide with him the attention and profits of—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>A collection of wild beasts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess you were not a sleeping partner here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; my companions were rather hostile to repose. Not much liking such uncivilized so∣ciety, and being a little apprehensive that my fellow-travellers might one time or other make a supper of me, I soon cut this connection; and instead of exhibiting the merits of others, I got a taste for displaying my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I joined a party of strolling players.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you must be shocked at my de∣scending so damn'd low as to turn actor. But I did not disgrace myself long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>How happened that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The audience would not let me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came out in Richard the Third. I thought it devilish fine; but the good folks in the front thought otherwise. I ranted—they hooted—However, I out-roared them, and pushed on till I got into Bosworth Field—"A horse, a horse! my kingdom for a horse!" When a drunken, Fox∣hunting squire (I shall never lose the sound of his damn'd voice) bawled out of the boxes, that I should have the best horse in his stable, if I would ride away directly, and never come back again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The actor's warn'd me it would not do. I thought it envy in them, and have some reason to think they sent in a party to hiss me. However, by way of comfort, they told me, though I should never act tragedy, they thought I should succeed in low comedy—Low comedy! only think of their impudence! Is this a face for low comedy? No, no, damn it! I could not stoop to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, your next resource?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, then I got a call, and mounted the habiliments in which you see me; this was lucra∣tive; but my conscience would not suffer me any longer to drain from the pockets of the poor, the earnings of their industry: nay, what is worse, em∣bitter their innocent minds with groundless terrors, and inspire them with prejudice against their fel∣low-creatures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then you deign at last to return to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; for I had rather cheat the rich, than delude the poor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I'll endeavour to find you employment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I don't doubt, as long as there is a pigeon to be plucked, and as I am disposed to be a rook at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I have at present honester objects in view, to attain which I may need your assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'm glad of that; for, upon my soul, I am tired of being a rogue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I reach the point of my present aim, I may, myself, relinquish that character. I shall then have wealth enough to gratify even <HI>my</HI> ambition. I am no further a knave than as it forwards my grand pursuit, the attainment of wealth. And who would not use any means to gain that, which covers vice with the garb of respect, and without which virtue meets but pity or derision.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes; but don't wrong my understanding—Only from necessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>You might triumph now, if you were dis∣posed to indulge spleen; for the man who was the chief gainer by your losses at play, is now as low in the world as yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am so completely without gratifica∣tion, I have not even the comfort a malicious dis∣position would afford me. It is far from a relief to me, to see another unfortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mutually distressed; yet, how differently you bear your misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is easily accounted for. I have a thousand resources—Drooply has none. Born to no other inheritance, I have learned to turn to ac∣count
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
what I inherit from nature; so that, tho' my acquisitions have been squandered, I am still in possession of my original patrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, you lucky dog! you have an estate in every corner of your brain, and a pretty income at the end of every finger. Now, the whole pro∣duce of my skull would not get me change for sixpence: and as for my hands, curse them! they are fit for nothing but to dangle by my sides, or stuff out my coat-pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I am afraid they will never fill your pockets with any thing but themselves.</P>

<P>Yes, a Turk: they are the only wise peo∣ple on earth: they teach all their great men some honest employment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do they? I know some great men I wish they would give a lesson to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh if we had that good mussulman custom among us, how many a rich man would be of more use to society when his estate was gone, than while he possessed it! as a good cobler is a more valuable character than a rich man who does not employ his wealth properly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you are turning moralist!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; the loss of wealth seldom lessens a man's morality. While I am creeping about, such a piece of moving lumber, what respect I feel for every reputable tinker that comes in my way. This very morning how I did envy a merry rogue of a shoeblack! With what glee he put the polish of an artist on the boot he was blacking: how merrily he brushed and sung, and how conceitedly and happily he looked at his work when he had done it! Oh, you jolly dog, thought I, what a happy man had been spoiled, if you had been born
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
to two thousand a year! you would never have enjoyed the luxury of polishing a shoe, or the in∣dependent exultation of existing by your own industry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must endeavour to dispel your melan∣choly. You are a martyr to <HI>ennui.</HI> I must find you employment.</P>

<P>You must do something beside—find me capacity.</P>

<P>That you don't want. Your talents have been only slumbering.</P>

<P>If they don't wake at that call, you may take your oath their slumber is everlasting. But tho' I am master of this poor tenement, I really am so ignorant of the state of the <HI>upper story,</HI> as not to know whether the inhabitants have perished by neglect, or are only dozing from want of em∣ployment; but this I do know, there is a lively fellow in the <HI>first floor</HI> <STAGE>(pointing to his heart)</STAGE> who would dance with joy to do you the slightest ser∣vice, and lose every drop of blood to prove his friendship and gratitude. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<P>Well, my dear brother, I am so glad we are to have our house full of company—Oh, that is delightful! How I do love a racketting, noisy scene! In a morning the fashionable bustle of Bond∣street, the musical thunder of a footman's rap—the dealing out tickets to the whole <HI>ton</HI>-world—and then at night, driving to twenty different assem∣blies—seeing the whole world in the course of an evening—Oh, dear, dear, what a charming age to live in! we see more of life in one day, than our ancestors did in their whole existence.</P>

<P>Yes; but I doubt whether we are the happier for it.</P>

<P>Well, I'm not Cynic enough to attempt to reason people out of their notions of happiness; for as it exists in imagination, the idea is the

reality. But, my dear Caroline, I have told you my wish to be thought well of by this young East Indian. From living in the same house, and being nearly of an age, you will most likely contract a friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and her taking my brother for her lover, will be the best security for that friendship; for then, we can't be rivals—and nothing is so apt to make young ladies disagree, as being both of the same mind.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oakw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gratitude to me! That is a great mis∣take of yours, and it behoves me to set you right. Mrs. Cleveland's father saved me once from ruin—me and my family from beggary; and I think he must have but a bad notion of the value of a kind∣ness done him, who, if he could live long enough, would not strive to repay it down to the fiftieth generation.</P>

<P>Why to be sure a mighty matter to be proud of, gentlemen, being known to an old stupid country bumpkin. Surely you be jeering a body—but if you be, I can't find in my heart to be angry; for as long as you are so good and so kind to the dear creatures I love, you may flout and jeer at me as much as you please.</P>

<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now the game is started, I must set my whole pack full cry for the chace. Here comes my prime agent in knavery, Sharpset. Having used him so essentially in the plunder of Drooply, and that business completed, I could have dis∣pensed with his return; for no intercourse is so grating as that which subsists with a confederate in villainy. However, to keep him in my power, I have still contrived to keep him in my debt; so that I need not fear him, and he has talents to render him still useful to me.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SHARPSET.</STAGE>
<P>I am glad to find you return'd to the laity. I would rather see knavery wear any garb than that of religion.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reason for which, is, that then only you are afraid of its being an overmatch for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so; but that I have not ceased to respect, tho' I have dared to violate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday! I believe you congratulate me on laying down the trade of preaching, because you mean to take it up. But it tells well for morality, that even some knaves can admire the cause, which honest men are risking their lives to defend. But, a truce to this style, for it sits awkwardly upon us. Your visitors, I find, are arrived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and the girl is beautiful as an angel.</P>

<P>Did not you tell me she was heiress to half a million?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! your servant—but I assure you her intrinsic worth—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can be nothing to her <HI>sterling</HI> worth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinced I feel something like love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure you do. I should adore a twentieth part of the sum, if it were in the pocket of the ugliest old harridan that ever was ducked for a witch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to hold beauty very cheap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no—I only value money very highly.</P>

<P>But when they are combined—</P>

<P>That is always possible—Whoever has the money, need not be long without the beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>In one object I hope to possess the ulti∣matum of my wishes in both. It must now be my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are to have all around her impressed with esteem for me—my eulogium wafted to her on every breath, cannot fail of infusing a favourable pre∣possession. Be you mindful, that on all occasions your report of me may swell the gale of appro∣bation. I need not tell you that your interest will be no sufferer by your panegyric.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I assure you I am so good natur'd a fellow, that, make it equally profitable to me, and I would rather speak in a man's praise than against him—So much am I unlike the greater part of my acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The chief personage I wish to enlist in my favour, is an old rustic, much devoted to the family, and ranking high in the mother's esteem. His name is Oakworth.</P>

<P>So, I am to throw myself in the way of this old rustic, Oakworth—You little guess, my very worthy friend, what you are directing—To throw myself in the way of no less interesting a personage to me than my identical dad—my own natural father. It is now a long while since I saw the good old boy:—I was but fourteen, I think, when it entered my mad head to scamper away from him—A project well worthy of so experi∣enced an age. That frolic has thrown me into many a situation which would be whimsical to re∣late—Yes, and many a situation it would not be prudent to relate. I long to have a glimpse of the old buck. I wonder whether he would know me—Whom have we got here? Oh! this is one of the Asiatic importations.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my little disciple of Brama! If the hallowed waves of the Ganges had any share in infusing this gratitude, I wish its stream lay near enough to be resorted to as a fashionable bathing place. This little sun-burnt favourite may do Leonard service—I'll try to retain her in his cause.

<P>No, no—Yes—one, mayhap—one may be alive—one ungracious boy—No, no; it be hardly possible, though there is a chance, a little chance—I have always kept a watch on the Old Bailey Sessions Papers, and the County Assize lists—and to be sure I never found his name down in them; but there is little certainty or comfort in that—for you know, my poor wicked boy may have been hanged, or sent to Botany Bay under some other name.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oakw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! sir, it grieves my heart to think it—but he had such little sharping tricks about him when he was but a child, that I were forced to lash, and lash, every day of my life. I dare say, if he be alive, he have got my well-meant marks on his back to this day.</P>
</SP>

<P>Really! It aches at the recollection. <STAGE>(aside).</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oakw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—you must suppose I had his well doing at heart—and so I never spared him. I did hope, by good advice, and good example, and a good horsewhip, all together, to have made an honest man of him—But the rogue scampered away when he was but a younker, and so got loose into the wide wicked world, with a bad disposition, and necessity to whet it. You must needs think as I do, about what is become of him.</P>

<P>I really think, sir, you judge too severely of your son, Je—What is your son's name, sir?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed I had rather.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have the most unaccountable domestic propensity. Has novelty no pleasure for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, 'tis novelty makes me domestic; a dear novelty, the novelty of a mother. Now I have gained her sweet society, should I resign it for frivolous amusements I can command at all times?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you are a dear, good girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where are you going this evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I cannot tell without referring to my engagement list; but as near as I can guess, to about a dozen assemblies, the opera, a concert, and a masqued ball.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Caroline, you'll be fatigued to death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no. I am never weary with pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you often make these laborious exertions for your amusement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, all through the season—And I don't think that half long enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, to be equal to such efforts, a woman of fashion must be endued with more strength than any creature in the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure. Your elephant is nothing to
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
her; for groveling instinct restrains him from ex∣ceeding the paltry limits of mere corporeal ex∣ertion; but the elevated spirits, and glowing ima∣gination of a woman of fashion make her a being all essence—She is like the wind, light, fleet, and invincible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is she not sometimes like the wind in my native country, which now breathes all gentle∣ness, yet, in a few hours will whirl a whole fortune to destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, I am afraid there have been in∣stances of the tornado kind. I really don't know whether many men may not be better pleased with your quiet stay-at-home notions, than with more dash and spirit; but perhaps you never yet ex∣amined your inclinations with an eye to how a husband would approve them. Ah, Julia, you blush, my dear; I believe this scrutiny has not been unattended to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you talk!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. I <HI>talk,</HI> and you <HI>think;</HI> but both on the same subject. My dear girl, have I yet claim enough on your confidence to ask, if the being I allude to has stolen into your dreams, and been admitted into your waking reveries in the form of a beautiful accomplished youth, whose exact like∣ness you have never yet realized, or have you already assigned him "A local habitation and a name?"</P>
</SP>

<P>And in what quarter of the globe does he exist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, where shou'd he? I have not been

long enough in this country to have found him here. I must have met him before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(aside).</STAGE> So, my poor brother, your chance is gone. What is his name?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>And you expect him here, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, in the same vessel with my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>And does he know your partiality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I know his for me; and my father approves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you happy girl! Now, the man I love neither knows my partiality for him; nor do I know whether he cares at all for me—And if we did know that we cared for each other, I am sure my father would let us care on till both our hearts broke, before he would give his consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the poor dear fellow has lost all his fortune; but luckily my father's consent is not essential, as I have a fortune independent of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are not in a very hopeless state?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, I am: for my lover (my love I should say) lost all self-importance with his for∣tune; and I very much fear I shall never be able to make him comprehend that a young woman with a good estate is ready to let him be master of it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told some friend?</P>
</SP>

out, and in a moment throng'd. In one, least crowded, was your father; he called to me, and earnestly conjured me to come into it—As I was going to comply, I saw a poor old man kneeling to heaven to save him from the fate his feeble age denied him to contend against. The boat could safely hold but one—I placed him in it, seized on a friendly coop, and with it trusted to the waves.</P>

<P>My generous Henry! But my father—</P>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sea was very boisterous, and often washed over me; yet, at intervals I snatched a short view, and still saw his boat riding in safety.

<P>Nay, droop not, Julia—This vessel was a sloop of war sailing for the Downs. Before I recovered, it was under weigh, I was therefore forced to remain in it till it gain'd its station.—Landed at Deal, I could of course hear no tidings of your father, whose boat, no doubt, safely reached the nearest shore. His not being yet arrived, argues nothing against his safety.</P>

<P>This girl, now the rightful inheritor of her father's immense fortune, must be mine.</P>

<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>

<P>To bear her away. Once in my posses∣sion, all may go smoothly: at her age, nay, at any age, a transfer of affection is no uncommon incident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the difficulty—See how she is sur∣rounded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Difficulty! every difficulty yields to the enterprising. Her lover is gone, like a true hero of romance, to conjure up the dead. 'Tis easy to get the rest out of the way—First, I'll remove the main obstacle, her rustic protector.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remove him! how do you mean, remove him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>We must lack invention, indeed, not to effect that—By an hundred stratagems we can keep him out of the way long enough to answer my purpose.</P>

<P>You astonish me. Well, well, this may turn to account. Then you may have influence to bring him over to my interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, nor all the world would be able to influence him to a dishonest action—Beside, friend Leonard, to let you into a secret, I neither like your scheme, nor wish to forward it. After a long absence, I have had the happiness to meet my father, and when I behold in him what a glow of youth an honest heart infuses into an aged face, I am determined to abandon my roguery, and try to make the rosy honours of honesty, hereditary.</P>

<P>You mean, then, to defeat my purposes?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Leonard, your own reflections will render that needless. Could you have fairly gained the girl's affections, I should have rejoiced at your success, and thought the society of an amiable woman the likeliest school for forming an honest man; but force—to use force against a lovely, helpless female, none but a devil could in∣spire the thought, and none but devils could be found to execute it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! one might judge by your energy that you were a new-made proselyte. Apostates are always the maddest enthusiasts—But, fool! do you think I am to be preached out of my inten∣tions?</P>

<P>And do you think I am to be bullied out of mine?</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, sir, take your course, but be cautious that you do not thwart me—Dare not to breathe a word of my designs, unless your devotion to your new tenets is warm enough to make you welcome a prison in their defence.

<P>If law can give the remedy, redress is certain; in this country the way to justice is not through blind mazes and crooked paths—No, 'tis a public road, open to all, obvious to all.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clev. to Leonard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we need your presence here no longer. My property I find is vested as I ap∣pointed. Now, sir, depart, loaded not with my reproaches, not with my malediction; for the whole world's contempt, and the heaviest curses of the injured would add but a feather's weight to the mountain of remorse which conscious guilt will heap upon thy wretched bosom. When I reflect on the severity of suffering conscience can inflict, I could almost forget my injuries, and pity thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>To palliate my guilt I do not seek—yet, in justice, let me declare, the erroneous judgment of the world made me a villian. I beheld the eye of observance and respect ever directed to the wealthy; were he fool or knave, no matter.
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
While all that is truly amiable or great in genius or in virtue, when linked with poverty, was heed∣ed with the stare of disavowal, or the scowl of contempt. To be a golden idol for the world's worship was my aim. I have lost my fortune, character, and happiness in the attempt, and now must meet in penury mankind's abhorrence, and feel too, I deserve it. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ. AND SPOKEN BY MRS. POPE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WELL, tho' our Bard has try'd his utmost art</L>
<L>To shew how riches will pollute the heart,</L>
<L>No doubt his labour has been all in vain,</L>
<L>And poverty will ne'er one convert gain.</L>
<L>How could the man attempt a task so bold!</L>
<L>But what, forsooth, can authors know of gold?</L>
<L>An ore that rarely darts on them a beam,</L>
<L>Unless, perchance, in hope's delusive dream;</L>
<L>Hope, that misleads them thro' life's weary way,</L>
<L>And scarcely leaves at last the barren bay.</L>
<L>What, wean the human heart from love of pelf!</L>
<L>A toil, too hard for Hercules himself!</L>
<L>Nay, that great hero, as we learn in story,</L>
<L>Strove for a little gain, as well as glory,</L>
<L>Else why attack the dreadful scaly brute,</L>
<L>If not to grasp the rich Hesperian fruit?</L>
<L>Hence, av'rice is a passion not so odd,</L>
<L>Since, as we find, it urg'd a demi-god.</L>
<L>'Twas also said of yore the female tribe,</L>
<L>Are frail as men when tempted by a bribe,</L>
<L>And mighty Jove, with all his boasted pow'r</L>
<L>Was forc'd to woo amid a golden show'r.</L>
<L>Oh! wond'rous charm of all-persuasive gold,</L>
<L>That fires the timid, and subdues the bold.</L>
<L>Gold, that can give the upstart blockhead fame,</L>
<L>And make a fawning world his wit proclaim;</L>
<L><PB REF="92"/>
That lends deformity resistless grace,</L>
<L>O'erthrows the mighty, and exalts the base;</L>
<L>Great substitute for learning, genius, worth,</L>
<L>Despotic sovereign of adoring earth!</L>
<L>But let me check the rash injurious thought,</L>
<L>For, in this court, no verdict can be bought.</L>
<L>Here merit safely may assert her plea,</L>
<L>While candour regulates the mild decree;</L>
<L>And by that candour one who oft has try'd</L>
<L>Its gen'rous force, his fate must now abide,</L>
<L>In hopes one error more will pardon find,</L>
<L>Since to his others you've so long been kind.</L>

<P>To the concurrent testimonies of all the periodical publications of taste and literature already adduced, we shall only add, from the European Magazine, that the writer of their Review, after delaying his account of the Work, in order to ascertain its authenticity, in the number for November last, says: "On the most indisputable testimony, and the highest authority, the writer has it now in his power to declare that these volumes, under the modest and limited title of The Life of the late Empress of Russia, comprise a faithful and impartial History of the Political Transactions and Publick Affairs of the Nor∣thern Courts of Europe during the Reign of Catharine II.; together with a regular narration of the progressive aggrandisement, civilization, and general improvement, of the Russian Empire, from the time of Peter the Great to that of the Death of the late Empress in 1796."</P>
<P N="2">2. ANECDOTES of LORD CHATHAM's LIFE. The Sixth Edition. In Three Volumes, 8vo. Price 18s. Boards.</P>
<Q>The author has made a valuable collection of Anecdotes, especially of the late and most conspicuous part of Lord Chatham's Life; and of other matters connected with it. He says he is not conscious of having advanced one falsehood: we give credit to his declacation, having found no cause to doubt it.
<BIBL>Monthly Review, May <HI>1792.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>A greater number of curious and interesting Anecdotes, concerning public affairs, have not appeared since the days of Sir William Temple, than are to be met with in this work.</P>
