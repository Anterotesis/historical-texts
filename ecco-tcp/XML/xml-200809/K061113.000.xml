<P>Yes, that was it; he got a huge deal of money from our high gentry here in England; but to save it all, and bring it away with him, he starved himself, and gave me nothing to eat: I'll be dom'd but he did, for his sallads made me pick dandelion, and water cresses out of the ditches; then he made maccoroni which be's just like our hard dumplings cut into long tobacco stoppers; then he made om∣lets, and when he used to boil eggs wanted me to sup the broth, a dom'd Italian son of a sausage, wanted to fatten me with egg broth, so I left him— oh, I left him.</P>
