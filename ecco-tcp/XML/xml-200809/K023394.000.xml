<L>"LEAVE, Hermit, leave these wilds forlorn;</L>
<L>Cast off this garb of woe;</L>
<L>With earliest gleam of opening morn</L>
<L>Thy guests prepare to go:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With earliest gleam of opening morn,</L>
<L>We'll spread the parting sail,</L>
<L>Far hence o'er rolling surges born,</L>
<L>Our native land to hail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>For, though in sore distress we came,</L>
<L>To beg relief from thee,</L>
<L>Yet not unknown to goodly fame,</L>
<L>We plough the dang'rous sea;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath yon cliff's impending side,</L>
<L>Within a secret bay,</L>
<L>Our vessel proudly stems the tide,</L>
<L>Our streamers lightly play:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, Hermit kind, with us return;</L>
<L>For this thy shelt'ring care,</L>
<L>Thy former dwelling let us learn,</L>
<L>We'll place thee safely there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"THIS lonely strand I'll ne'er forsake,</L>

<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<L>Here, till in death my limbs are cold,</L>
<L>A sacred vow I'll keep,</L>
<L>Full oft, o'er yonder swelling mould,</L>
<L>To pray, to fast, and weep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, though my vow forbid return,</L>
<L>My native land to hail,</L>
<L>Would you my former dwelling learn,</L>
<L>I'll not refuse the tale:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A tale of grief and blushing shame</L>
<L>My lips must then disclose,</L>
<L>Yet so shall mem'ry keep my name,</L>
<L>And pity mourn my woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A sire of noble birth I own,</L>
<L>On Rosay's fertile plain:</L>
<L>No care his tranquil life had known,</L>
<L>Unvex'd by grief or pain;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Till Heav'n, alas! my sins ordain'd</L>
<L>To wake his virtuous rage,</L>
<L>And shame, unfelt before, distain'd</L>
<L>The silver'd cheek of age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With him in social union bound</L>
<L>Earl Hubert long had been;</L>
<L>Their youth the palm of friendship crown'd,</L>
<L>And age beheld it green.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Now straight prepare your horsemen all,"</L>
<L>Said the Earl, "to go with me;</L>
<L>"I have a feast in bow'r and hall,</L>
<L>"Where you must shortly be."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Set forth, set forth," my sire replied,</L>
<L>"Set forth without delay;</L>
<L>"However fleetly you shall ride,</L>
<L>"We'll pass you on the way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<L>With me I'll bring my son along,</L>
<L>"To grace your bow'r and hall,</L>
<L>"And if he fail in dance or song,</L>
<L>"On me the blame shall fall."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The minstrels play'd; the hall was bright,</L>
<L>The bow'r was fair to see;</L>
<L>And there came many a noble knight,</L>
<L>And maid of high degree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But 'midst those maidens all so fair,</L>
<L>More fair than all was one;</L>
<L>In peerless boast of beauty rare</L>
<L>The gentle Emma shone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of humble birth, she early mourn'd</L>
<L>A parent's shorten'd date;</L>
<L>But heav'n to joy her grief had turn'd,</L>
<L>And giv'n a kinder fate:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<L>The partner of Earl Hubert's breast</L>
<L>The helpless babe survey'd,</L>
<L>And pity soft in tears confest,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>In rip'ning charms the nursling grew,</L>
<L>And youth its lustre shed;</L>
<L>Less fair the rose's blushing hue,</L>
<L>When first its leaves are spread:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her eyes were as the diamond bright,</L>
<L>But shone with temper'd ray,</L>
<L>Like northern meteors, that by night</L>
<L>O'er heav'n's pale azure play.</L>

<HEAD>CANTO II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN youth beats high in ev'ry vein,</L>
<L>And passion fires the mind,</L>
<L>What can the wand'ring thought restrain,</L>
<L>The lawless spirit bind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too strong by reason to be sway'd,</L>
<L>Desire my torment grew,</L>
<L>For fair as Dian was the maid,</L>
<L>But chaste as Dian too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How shall your virtuous ears endure,</L>
<L>My guilty tongue repeat,</L>
<L>What arts I us'd, her love to lure,</L>
<L>And watchful honor cheat!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<L>Too well I strove; the maiden lov'd;</L>
<L>Her devious steps I led;</L>
<L>To duty lost, we secret rov'd,</L>
<L>And banish'd virtue fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ill-omen'd deed! the hope how vain,</L>
<L>Each social tie foregone,</L>
<L>That constancy should yet remain,</L>
<L>And faith, intent on one!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who first pollutes the tender mind,</L>
<L>And leads from truth astray,</L>
<L>Ne'er let him hope again to find</L>
<L>The gem he casts away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fatal change, thus subtly wrought,</L>
<L>I justly learnt to rue;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the freedom I had taught,</L>
<L>To other loves she flew:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<L>Five lonely months my anxious fears</L>
<L>Her flight in vain explor'd;</L>
<L>And oft my fondly-falling tears</L>
<L>Her fancied death deplor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, Vanity, that <HI>Man</HI> beguiles,</L>
<L>Who boasts the stronger mind!</L>
<L>In <HI>Woman</HI>'s charms and native wiles,</L>
<L>Defeat still doom'd to find!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If haply here some list'ning guest</L>
<L>Have known like pains to prove,</L>
<L>Let his consenting heart attest</L>
<L>How stoops our sex to Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Before my gate, in winter's cold,</L>
<L>A trembling mourner stood;</L>
<L>A tale of piteous want she told,</L>
<L>And, plaintive, begg'd for food:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<L>Beneath that garb of friendless woe</L>
<L>My Emma stood confest;</L>
<L>I clasp'd, ere words had pow'r to flow,</L>
<L>The wand'rer to my breast:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I strove to chide, but faintly blam'd;</L>
<L>Then met her ardent kiss;</L>
<L>Desire again my soul inflam'd,</L>
<L>And hope renew'd my bliss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fond, pleasing dream! too quickly o'er!</L>
<L>The false one fled again:</L>
<L>Amaz'd I griev'd, but vow'd no more</L>
<L>To prize a heart so vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our angry vows Love turns to jest;</L>
<L>While yet her loss I mourn'd,</L>
<L>Again repentance touch'd her breast,</L>
<L>Again the fair return'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<L>And, while I view'd those fatal charms,</L>
<L>Upon my neck she hung;</L>
<L>To earth I shook her from my arms,</L>
<L>Around my knees she clung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Forgive the wretch," she suppliant cried,</L>
<L>"The wretch thy flatt'ries made! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verbis capta Puella tuis. Ov.Ep.</NOTE></L>
<L>"By Pleasure's voice, Ah, faithless guide!</L>

<L>"Let me my sins atone!</L>
<L>"This let repentant anguish win,</L>
<L>"To live with thee alone!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus o'er a bosom fondly soft</L>
<L>She triumph'd unrestrain'd;</L>
<L>Oft from my arms she fled, and oft</L>
<L>Those shelt'ring arms regain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<L>So flitting on the summer's breeze,</L>
<L>Delighted far to roam,</L>
<L>The swallow, born o'er smiling seas,</L>
<L>Awhile forgets her home:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But scar'd at sight of wintry gloom,</L>
<L>When chilling blasts arise,</L>
<L>With trembling wing and ruffled plume,</L>
<L>Returns to friendlier skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the destin'd hour was near,</L>
<L>That rose to fix our fate;</L>
<L>For still on folly's wild career</L>
<L>Chastising sorrows wait.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once when, by lengthen'd absence tried,</L>
<L>Love pour'd the weary tear,</L>
<L>And hope her wonted aid denied</L>
<L>My fruitless search to cheer,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<L>It chanc'd, at morn I bent my way</L>
<L>From Harfleur's lonely tow'rs,</L>
<L>To where its tides in Havre's bay</L>
<L>The western ocean pours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There as I wander'd, lost in thought,</L>
<L>Faint notes of female cry <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>Hom. Od.</NOTE></L>
<L>My ear with frequent wonder caught,</L>
<L>And drew my curious eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far off, advancing where I stood,</L>
<L>A convict group I spied;</L>
<L>Behind, the fiends of pow'r pursued,</L>
<L>Each ling'ring step to chide:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By force compell'd, the guilty band</L>
<L>Reluctant sought the shore,</L>
<L>Whence doom'd to leave a forfeit land,</L>
<L>And to return no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<L>Pitying, I mark'd their hopeless lot,</L>
<L>And heard their clanking chains;</L>
<L>Their errors in their griefs forgot,</L>
<L>Their vices in their pains;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor thought, while flow'd the ready tear</L>
<L>For sorrows not my own,</L>
<L>My doom to share those griefs how near,</L>
<L>And mingle groan with groan!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when dire phantoms of the night</L>
<L>Sleep's soft infoldment break,</L>
<L>Up leaps the wretch in wild affright,</L>
<L>And doubts if yet he wake;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So rous'd, at once, with startling dread,</L>
<L>Amid the guilty train</L>
<L>I saw my Emma captive led,</L>
<L>And partner of their pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<L>The distant sight perhaps deceiv'd,</L>
<L>With eager step I flew—</L>
<L>Too soon I came—nor yet believ'd</L>
<L>The horrid vision true. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nec tantum scelus esse putabam. Ov. Ep.</NOTE></L>

<L>To heav'n her eyes intent were cast,</L>
<L>And pour'd a chrystal flood;</L>
<L>The flinty pavement, as she pass'd,</L>
<L>Was mark'd with streaks of blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I stood distracted and appall'd;</L>
<L>Then faintly breath'd her name;</L>
<L>Each wand'ring sense my voice recall'd,</L>
<L>And shook her feeble frame:</L>
</LG>

<L>Her feeble frame no more sustains;</L>
<L>Her eyes flash wildly round;</L>

<L>With silent joy each breath I heard,</L>

<L>To bless the wholesome rest:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hope charm'd awhile my troubled thought,</L>

<L>"Hold! hold! they drag him hence away!</L>

<L>Then forth my doubtful course I took,</L>
