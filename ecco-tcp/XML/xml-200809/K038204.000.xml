<LG>
<L>LADIES and Gentlemen, <HI>I'll tell you what!</HI></L>
<L>Yet not, like antient Prologue, tell the Plot;</L>
<L>But, like a modern Prologue, try each way</L>
<L>To win your Favour tow'rds the coming Play.</L>
<L>Our Author, is a Woman—that's a Charm</L>
<L>Of Power to guard herself and Play from harm.</L>
<L>The Muses, Ladies Regent of the Pen,</L>
<L>Grant Women Skill, and Force, to write like Men.</L>
<L>Yet they, like the AEolian Maid of old,</L>
<L>Their Sex's Character will ever hold:</L>
<L>Not with bold Quill too roughly strike the Lyre,</L>
<L>But with the <HI>Feather</HI> raise a soft Desire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Poetess has gain'd sublimest heights:</L>
<L>Not Sapho's Self has soar'd to nobler Flights;</L>
<L>For she, bright Spirit, the first British Fair,</L>
<L>Climb'd unappall'd, the unsubstantial Air;</L>
<L>And here, beneath the Changes of the Moon,</L>
<L>Wond'ring you saw her launch a grand Balloon; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the Farce of the "Mogul Tale, or Descent of the Balloon," produced the Year before by the Authosess.</NOTE></L>
<L>While she with steady Course, and Flight not dull,</L>
<L>Paid a short Visit to the Great Mogul.</L>
<L>Shrink not, Nabobs! Our Poetess to-night</L>
<L>Wakes not the Genius of Sir Matthew Mite.</L>
<L>Beyond our Hemisphere she will not roam,</L>
<L>Keeps in the Line, and touches nearer Home;</L>
<L>Nay will not, as before, howe'er you scorn her,</L>
<L>Reach e'en the Turnpike-gate at Hyde Park Corner.</L>
<L>But hold—I say too much—I quite forgot—</L>
<L>And so I'll tell you—No—SHE'LL <HI>tell you what.</HI></L>

<SP>
<LG>
<L>MALE Criticks applaud to the Skies the Male Scribblers—</L>
<L>When a Woman attempts, they turn Carpers and Nib∣blers;</L>
<L>But a true Patriot Female, there's nothing so vexes.</L>
<L>As this haughty Pre-eminence claim'd'twixt the Sexes.</L>
<L>The free Spirit revolts at each hard Proposition,</L>
<L>And meets the whole System with loud Opposition.</L>
<L>Men, 'tis true, in their Noddles huge Treasures may hoard,</L>
<L>But the <HI>Heart</HI> of a Woman with Passions is stor'd.</L>
<L>With Passions not copied from Latin or Greek,</L>
<L>Which the Language of Nature in plain English speak.</L>
<L>Girls who grieve, or rejoice, from true Feeling, as I do,</L>
<L>Never dream of Calypso, or Helen, or Dido.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To the End of our Life, from the Hour we begin it,</L>
<L>Woman's Fate all depends on the Critical Minute.</L>
<L>A Minute unknown to the dull Pedant Tribe,</L>
<L>And which never feeling, they never describe.</L>
<L>'Tis no Work of Science, or Sparkle of Wit,</L>
<L>But a Point which mere Nature must teach us to hit;</L>
<L>And which, in the Changes and Turns of my Story,</L>
<L>A weak Woman's Pen has to-night laid before ye.</L>
<L>And say, ye grave Prudes! Gay Coquettes too, ah say,</L>
<L>What a Critical Minute was mine in the Play!</L>
<L>Here Poverty, Famine, and Shame, and Reproach;</L>
<L>There Plenty and Ease, and a Lord and a Coach.</L>
<L>But perhaps our Bard held Mrs. Euston too mean,</L>
<L>And conceiv'd her Disgrace wou'd but lower the Scene;</L>
<L>Let us then, better pleas'd to acquit than convict her,</L>
<L>On the Ground of High Life, sketch the very same Pic∣ture!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imagine some Fair, plung'd in modish Distress,</L>
<L>Her Wants not less than mine, nor her Agony less.</L>
<L>At Hazard, suppose, an unfortunate Cast,</L>
<L>Has swept her last Guinea, nay, more than her last.</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>Her Diamonds all mortgag'd, her Equipage sold,</L>
<L>Her Husband undone, genteel Friends looking cold;</L>
<L>At her Feet his sweet Person, Lord Foppington throws,</L>
<L>The most handsome of Nobles, the richest of Beaux!</L>
<L>At once too his Love and his Bounty dispenses,</L>
<L>Sooths with Thousands her Grief, lulls with Flatt'ry her Senses.</L>
<L>Alas, what a Minute! Ah! What can be done?</L>
<L>All Means must be tried, and our Drama shews one.</L>
<L>Let Papa in that Minute, that so frowns upon her,</L>
<L>Redeem the vile Debts that encumber her Honour!</L>
<L>Let Papa in that Minute that teems with undoing,</L>
<L>Step in like my Father, and marr a Lord's wooing!</L>
<L>Let her know, as I've known, all the Horror that's in it,</L>
<L>And feel the true Force of the Critical Minute!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus wishes our Bard, as she bids me declare;</L>
<L>And such is my Wish, by my <HI>Honour</HI> I swear.</L>

<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT, my dear Uncle, why in such a passion?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help it—I am out of all patience!—Did not I leave you one of the happiest men in the world?—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and so you find me, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis false—you are not happy—you can't be happy— 'tis false—and you shan't be happy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are resolved to make me otherwise, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am not resolved—'tis yourself that is resolved—Did not I leave you one of the happiest of men?—married to one of the most beautiful women in the world?—Did not I give you my blessing and a large fortune, and did I not stay and see you father of a fine boy?—Then only just stept over to visit my estate in St. Kitts, and, now I'm come back, here I find you married to another woman—and your first wife still <HI>living</HI>—and, egad, she is married to another man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Uncle, I should certainly have asked your opinion and my Uncle An∣thony's on the subject, but your absence put it out of my power, and it was universally believed the ship in which you sailed was lost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you'll hear what my brother will say to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I trust, Sir, when I have ex∣plained every thing, you will not only think me worthy of your pardon but even of being plead∣ed for to my Uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed—Nay, were it in my power to do you any good, I wou'd not—I shan't forgive you myself—much less ask him—But you are right in fixing on me for a mediator; my brother pays much regard to me truly—I have been of infinite service, to be sure, in reconciling him to his own poor boy. Nay, did he not even (for my brother Anthony would always be mas∣ter, although he was the youngest) when I went to him to persuade him to forgive poor Charles,
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>his son, did he not even (instead of my gaining him over and getting something for the poor boy) did he not even draw me into a promise never to do any thing for him myself?—My bro∣ther does what he pleases with me—but nobody else shall—No, what I want in resolution, to him, I'll make up in obstinacy, to other peo∣ple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you will but hear the just pleas I have to offer—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will hear no pleas—What do you think my brother will say? Why you inconsi∣derate boy! He had designed you for his heir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be as sorry, Sir, to excite his displeasure as I am at incurring yours; yet, give me leave to add, I should derive very little enjoyment from the possession of a fortune which his son, my poor cousin, (but for a single act of imprudence) had a right to expect. And be assured, Sir, that if this seeming indiscretion of mine, when compared with that of his son's, shou'd be regarded so unfavorably as to make <HI>his</HI> offence appear lighter to my Uncle, and move him to forgiveness—I will contentedly support the burthen of his resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now that's well spoken—You silly young rogue, I am not angry with you for getting rid of your wife—(for that I dare say is what every sensible man in the world wou'd do, if he cou'd) I am only angry with you for getting another—Cou'd not you know when you were well off, you blockhead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Uncle, as you are a bachelor, and can only speak of wives from the∣ory, suppose we drop the subject?—Is my Uncle Anthony come to his house? He knows no∣thing of the alteration that has taken place in my family, you tell me.—Shou'd I wait on him, or do you think he will favor me with a visit first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now what a deal of cere∣mony!—'Tis a fine thing to <HI>look</HI> like a man of consequence. My brother Anthony has had more privilege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from his looks than I ever had from being eldest son—even you, whom I love so well, and have given half my fortune to (and 'tis not long you know that you have expected a six pence from Anthony) yet you never meet <HI>him</HI> without a low bow. "How do you do Sir?—I hope you are well, Uncle!—I am glad to see you!"—And you stumble over <HI>me,</HI> with "So Uncle, how is it? how is it Uncle"—And when you in∣vite us both, "Uncle Anthony, I hope I shall have the <HI>honor</HI> of your company"—While you give me a nod, "Uncle, I shall see you."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, with every other person 'tis the same thing—If we are stuffed into a coach, with a little chattering pert Miss, "Oh dear, Mr. Anthony Euston, you must not ride back∣wards, here is room for <HI>you</HI> on this seat—and <HI>Mr. Euston,</HI> I know, will like one seat as well as ano∣ther"—ad then am I put with my back to the horses, though my head is whirling all the time
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>like one of the coach wheels. Then if any thing be lost, or wanted, when no servant is by, "Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> Euston must not stir for the world—but <HI>Mr. Euston,</HI> they know, will be so kind as to go for it."—And this is all because I am good na∣tured. Egad! if this is my reward, no wonder there are so few in the world of my temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Sir, no jesting—Does my Uncle intend to call on me or not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I dare say he <HI>did</HI> intend it; and, if he does not hear of what you have been doing, before he gets to your house, he will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my dear Uncle, will you step home, and give orders that none of the servants mention any thing to him this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now!—" <HI>I</HI> step home and give orders!" There 'tis, again!—Wou'd you ask my brother to "step home, and give orders?" No, I fancy not!—But I—poor I—will be so good as to do it you think—But for once I won't—Besides, Anthony never asks questions of servants. We enquired of our house-keeper, indeed, how you did, last night; she told us both you and your Lady were well, and so we thought all safe. Anthony will ask no more questions, therefore you may have the pleasure of explaining matters to him yourself, as you have to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd be sorry if any imper∣fect account shou'd reach him; for, so sincere is my respect for him, I wou'd not even suffer for
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>a moment in his esteem. I will be with him in half an hour, but I am afraid—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he'll not be out, nor have had any company in that time—for my brother is no sailor, and he'll be too fond of the exchange of a bed for a hammock to be stirring so soon. However, I think I <HI>will</HI> step home and give a caution to the servants that they don't mention your divorce to him.—As for my∣self, I'll keep out of his way—I'll not go near him—for I will say this for my brother, although it was never in my power to persuade him to for∣give an injury or an indiscretion in my life, yet I never said to him, "Brother Anthony <HI>don't</HI> forgive a thing," that he did not take my ad∣vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Uncle, walk into the parlor before you go—Let me introduce you to Lady Euston—Do step in and take your choco∣late with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, by the time I have ta∣ken a turn in the Park, and eaten a mouthful of dinner, you'll, perhaps, have a new Lady Euston to introduce me to, and I may drink tea with <HI>her.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Uncle, whether you stay or go, I must bid you a good morning, for I am obliged to attend a friend, who has a lawsuit depending, and I fear I shall be waited for—my presence won't be required long, and I'll be with my Uncle Anthony within half an hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, <STAGE>[Going]</STAGE> but you had better take an hour—Let me advise you to take an hour. Anthony is devilish sharp—he is not to be imposed upon. Take an hour, or an hour and half, before you see him—Anthony is a deep man, he is not to be deceived—for, I dare say, in his time, he has been as idle as yourself—and I <HI>will</HI> go on your errand.</P>

<P>O yes, my Lady, I have known of it these three months; but, as they kept out of town till within this fortnight, and your Lady∣ship has been abroad most of that time, I thought I would not tell your Ladyship till we returned to London, when your Ladyship was sure to hear of it. Why they live but just by, madam; and my master, I know, has been several times in company where they have been visiting.</P>

<P>Ay, she was your master's intended.</P>

<P>O yes, my Lady, I know that.</P>

<P>Insignificant girl—I tri∣umphed, when I snatched him from her, and now I suppose she thinks to triumph equally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, madam—But, if I was you, I wou'd let her see I cared nothing about him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you imagine I do care? No, indeed, Bloom; my exchange is for the better, I am certain; and <STAGE>[sighing]</STAGE> entirely to my satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I think so, madam: you cer∣tainly have changed for the better—and, bless me, I think, of all the husbands I ever saw, my present master is sure the fondest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for that—no one cou'd be fonder than Sir George, at first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, my Lady, but Major Cyprus is not so flighty as Sir George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so slighty— <STAGE>(<HI>sighs.</HI>)</STAGE> I have been envy'd Sir George's gaiety a thou∣sand times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Lady, when your Lady∣ship married first, I suppose; but you know, in a few months, Sir George altered so much, and seemed so miserable, I protest every single rap that came at the door made my blood run cold, for I took it for the report of a pistol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not have feared him, Bloom—he is too fond of the pleasures of
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>this life. Dear pleasures which he wanted to retrench me in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>More shame for him, madam.—Now my present master is a soldier; and, what is more, I dare say will soon be call'd on to go abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I beg your Ladyship's pardon—I thought perhaps your Ladyship wished to see the Major show himself a courageous gen∣tleman in the field; and that that was the rea∣son of your presering him to Sir George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I prefer! Did not my brother, from Sir George's humiliating suspi∣cions and cruel treatment of me, compel us to a divorce; and then, as a defence for my weak∣ness, forced me into the arms of the Major; being, I suppose, convinced that nothing less than a soldier, should undertake the guard of a Lady's honor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, madam—and I heard the Major say, this morning, as your Ladyship left the room, that "your Ladyship's honor would reqnire the guard of a file of mus∣keteers."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ungenerous man—even worse to me than Sir George—for poor Sir George, from my indiscreet partiality to this ingrate, had some pretence for his unkind ap∣prehensions; but Mr. Cyprus, who knows what
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>proofs of affection I have given him, even in preference to the man I had sworn to love—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I fancy, that is what frightens my master; for I believe he is a little fearful lest your Ladyship shou'd chance to be forsworn again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insolent supposition—He knows the delicacy of my sentiments—my honor to Sir George—knows that, although his un∣wearied artifices conquered my too susceptible heart, and hurried me to indiscretions, I merit∣ed not that severe contumely I have en∣dured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless my soul!—Well now I assure you, you surprize me!—And so, my Lady, there was nothing at all in it, when Sir George found my master in the closet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Lady, nothing—I hope I did not distress your Ladyship by the mention of Sir George's second marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, indeed, I always thought, as your Ladyship wou'd not live with him yourself, your Ladyship did not wish to prevent them that wou'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't mention that in∣significant woman!</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so Sir George has been married these three months to another, and intirely forgot me—To be so soon forgotten!—I shall never now forget him, I am certain. He has behaved like a man of resolution and spirit in casting me from his heart, and I feel the irreparable loss. Why were we divorced? I shou'd have disliked him still had be been my husband; and yet how tender, how patient to my failings to what Mr. Cyprus is—His cruel and unjust suspicions of me are not to be borne.—How provokingly did he treat me last night—I was too tame—but the next time he insults me, with his jealousy, I will endeavor to augment rather than pacify it—I'll try a reverse of conduct—Though, indeed, I <HI>am</HI> tolerably provoking in all our wrangles:—yes, thank heaven, I can say as cool spiteful things as any woman in the world.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Major, this is the first visit I have made since I set my foot in London.—Nay, and faith, no great compliment to you, neither; for, as I parted with my fellow passengers at Portsmouth, I don't know that I have a friend or acquaintance in the whole town but yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy in your want of friends, Colonel, if it gives you occasion to con∣sider me as one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for that, I don't want friends neither, I believe; only they are not here, at present. I have plenty of friends on the other side the Atlantic.—Zounds, I think it wou'd be hard for a man, who has been so long in the army, and borne a post like mine in it, not to have a <HI>regiment</HI> of friends, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is a great consolation to you, no doubt, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greatest in the world, Major. But what!—you have changed your house since I was last in England—this is not the same, I think, tho' near the same spot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—I have changed my house—and, what is more, changed my state too, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you are not married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS</SPEAKER>
<P>What surprises you?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I am not sur∣prised at your marrying, only at your appearing so easy about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not, Colonel? A valuable woman—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true—very true—and so I wish you joy with all my heart. <STAGE>(<HI>Shaking hands</HI>).</STAGE> But, who is the Lady, pray? Do I know her, or any of her family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you know Sir George Euston?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was his Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A widow!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—she was no widow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you say she was Sir George Euston's wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true—but Sir George is still living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the devil, is the man living, and you married to his wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a divorce, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A divorce!—Whu!—Now I understand you.—Why that's <HI>mariage en militaire.</HI>—You might well appear so easy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fy, Colonel—I assure you Lady Harriet Cyprus and I are a most happy cou∣ple—and my having snatched her from "a dull doating husband" gives superior pleasure and triumph to our bliss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The husband is much obliged to you both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, poor fellow, that is the worst—In spite of the congratulations I receive from my friends, and my natural desire of fame, and propensity to conquest, I do feel, and can∣not help it, a most deep sorrow and compassion for the thorns I have planted in his bosom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, I suppose, he used his Lady very ill, before he provoked her to the divorce, and certainly prefer'd some other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, by no means!—He doated on her, even to the day of their separation, notwithstanding it was he who sued for the di∣vorce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He</HI> who sued for the di∣vorce—Oh! that was it! I understood you, that you had planted <HI>thorns</HI>—but you said <HI>horns</HI> I sup∣pose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS. (<HI>Smiles</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I wish you much joy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ironically, Colonel? De∣pend upon it, I am the envy of all the men in town—Lady Harriet Cyprus is a perfect beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad she is perfect in some respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! <STAGE>(<HI>With some inquietude</HI>)</STAGE> ridiculous, Colonel—Divorces happen now every day—and the favoured lover is the most admired and envy'd of mortals, while the poor husband becomes an object of general pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, the husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and <HI>you</HI> are the husband now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! the forsaken husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You pity him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, if he is a tender hearted man, I suppose, he pities you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha—Let me describe a scene to you, where poor Sir George's situation must affect the most obdurate heart. Lady Har∣riet Euston (now Lady Harriet Cyprus) was, when I first became acquainted with her, a very loving wife: (we are friends, Colonel, and I will venture to recount a few anecdotes to you) a very loving wife indeed; and but for my insinu∣ations—artful insinuations I may call them—had continued her conjugal regard—she had been
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>to this hour an example to wives, if I had not tempted her to stray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, you!—or some∣body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS. (<HI>Disturbed</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me out, Co∣lonel—she was long an example to wives—she was I assure you.—But to describe to you Sir George's pitiable situation, and what was chiefly the cause of the divorce—One even∣ing we had prolonged the <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> rather beyond the usual time; when, unexpected∣ly, Sir George and a party of beaux and belles were rushing up stairs,—"Dear Ma∣jor," cried my wife—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wife?—Sir George's you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYRPUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir George's <HI>then</HI>—but my wife <HI>now.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, and I most sincerely give you joy!</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>Ironically.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, you put me out—"Dear Major," cried my wife: or Sir George's! if you will have it so—"What will become of us," (for Sir George had given us some little proofs of his jealousy) "what will become of us!" exclaimed the then Lady Harriet Euston—"Put me into your thimble; into the eye of your needle, madam," said I—Instead of which, cramm'd I was into that closet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That closet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>That very identical closet, which you see there—for Sir George never loved the
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>house after, and so settled it on her Ladyship—Screwed up in that closet, I believe I remained ten minuets; when old Lady Downfall, who was of the party, called for drops, the door was opened,— and out dropt your humble servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, it was enough to make you wish yourself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it was Sir George's place to wish. Every beau in the room was round me in a moment; and, in a whisper, "Give you joy Major"—"The happiest man in the world"—"An Alexander"—"A conqueror every where."—Even old Sir Samson Shrivel, shook his head and wished to be in my place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds I would have thrust him into the closet, and kept him there for a month. But what did the husband say all this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is what I was going to tell you—What did he say? Why, he said nothing. You may depend upon it, he heard and saw all the half stifled laughs, and was wise enough to know to whom they were directed—so poor fel∣low he turned pale—bit his lips—looked at her Ladyship—looked at me—looked at his sword—and then cried, "Heigh ho!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigh ho!—And what the deuce did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAJOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you think I said? Egad I <HI>was</HI> a little confused.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confused!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you know I said—Faith it was an odd speech, and has been laughed at since in a thousand sashionable circles—the con∣clusion of it has been particularly marked. Dear Sir George, said I—He was standing where you may be (here, a little more this way) and I just where I am at present—"Dear Sir George," said I (half stifling a laugh, for by my soul I could not help it, though I pitied the poor devil too) Dear Sir George, said I, "I'll tell you what"—you will find <HI>nobody</HI> to blame in this affair—I protest my being in that closet was entirely ow∣ing to "I'll tell you what"—In short to an—an <HI>undescribable something</HI>—There I made a full stop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>"An undescribable something."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true upon my soul; those were the very words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Owing to an, "Unde∣scribable something," and "I'll tell you what," that I got into this closet: and so I suppose the next day Sir George left both his wife and the closet, and you have ever since held possession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>After some other explana∣tions, and regular proceedings, I became the happy husband he was never formed to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope you keep the key of the closet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will have your joke, Colo∣nel—Sir George, out of despair, is just married
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>again—and Lady Harriet's affection for me is such—yet faith I must confess, to you, too Colonel, that noth with standing I am so very happy in my marriage—my wife so very beautiful and so af∣fectionate—yet I am a sad wicked fellow; I have not forgot my old ways—no, I am going to∣morrow evening to meet a Lady of untarnished reputation—a married lady—Faith 'tis wrong—I know it is—but I cannot withstand the temp∣tation—no, I cannot forget my old ways.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>Yawning.</HI>)</STAGE>

<P>And do you suppose her Ladyship can forget <HI>her</HI> old ways either?</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>Yawning.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, Colonel—but you are so fond of a joke—egad I have a great mind to make you laugh most heartily at the business I have now on my hands—you wou'd say it was the most impudent thing of me—I'll tell you another time, on puporse to make you laugh; no other design whatever. <STAGE>(<HI>A bell rings</HI>)</STAGE> That is her Ladyship's bell—come I will introduce you to her directly; and, I flatter myself, you will ad∣mire my choice.</P>

<P>Madam, you make me hap∣pier than I can express.—But how cou'd the mistake happen?—They told me my nephew lived here—Indeed, I named no names at the door, but only ask'd the man if his master was within; and your name being Euston, madam, I suppose, first cased the mistake.</P>

<P>What already? And, for Heaven sake, of whom?</P>

<P>Nay, I assure you he has no cause—Nor is he jealous of one, alone—he is so of every body—and will be so of you—therefore, I tell you, that you may be on your guard.—I am constantly with his Lady and him, and, be∣cause the poor woman once shut him up in her closet, he now suspects a lover concealed in every part of the house—and I have known him, when the mad fit has been upon him, search for a supposed rival even in her drawers and band∣boxes.</P>

<P>Pray Sir, do you live in the house?</P>

<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And during that time—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have seen such things! Enough to terrify me from marrying—for wives are some∣times so provoking, I am sure I cou'd not keep my temper—Now, here is Lady Harriet Cy∣prus—you cannot think how provoking she is

<P>Why you wou'd not beat her, would you? or lock her up?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—but perhaps I might kick her lap dog, or do some outrage to her dress.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wou'd make an admirable soldier, Sir Harry.</P>

<P>Give me your hand, Sir Harry.—I like you much—and could I see you master of a firelock, or a wife—</P>

<P>You have!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he never was jealous of <HI>me.</HI> Zounds it piques me sometimes.—The ladies are fond of me, and yet the gentlemen are not jea∣lous of me—But, indeed, my amours have all been managed so secretly that none of them have ever yet come to light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who has been to blame there, Sir Harry?</P>

<P>Yes, Sir—for, while I give you joy on your marriage, give me leave to say that, mine is all damped by the loss of him—and my grief is doubly poignant; because, till this moment, I was not only unacquainted with Lady Harriet's second marriage, but, till this moment, I did not even know Sir George was dead!</P>

<P>Why, my brother messmate, you are just like me—I had forgot that a man in England might marry his neigh∣bour's wife, and his neighbour living in the next street.—And 'tis not the wives of their neighbours, only, these generous gentlement assail, but more especially the wives of their <HI>friends.</HI></P>

<P>Dear Sir, let me assure you that, however Lady Harriet's conduct may meet censure from the unfeeling prude, the woman of sensibility and taste must applaud her spirit,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did her Ladyship then sue for the divorce?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>

<P>Is Sir George married again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, he is married—He has won the lady—and he has won her for∣tune—but for her affection—there, I believe, we must excuse Sir George—that is a stake now playing for by many noblemen of fashion.</P>
</SP>

<P>I suspect Sir George is the dupe of a fashionable gallantry.—I know his virtues—and am sorry to find a man of merit so betrayed.</P>

<P>Dear Sir, think on Lady Harriet, your relation.</P>
</SP>

<P>Thank heaven, all ties be∣tween Lady Harriet and me were dissolved when she was divorced from Sir George—and so they should, Sir, had she been my own daughter, and Sir George, with the principles I know he pos∣sesses, an utter stranger to me.</P>

<P>For heaven's sake, who is this man? I took him to be Lady Harriet's un∣cle! Explain to me who the brute is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He came passenger from the West-Indies in the same ship with me, and that was the first of our acquaintance.—As he was no more reserved than I, we soon became intimate; and I learnt from him that his fortune (a pretty good one) was designed for a nephew, whom I now recollect (tho' the deuce take me if I thought of it before) to be this very Sir George Euston—and a son, an only child, by that wife he speaks so tenderly of, he disin∣herits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the very savage I heard Lady Harriet say the other day was drown'd.—What, has his son been guilty of the criminality of a divorce?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—his guilt is in being married—married to some poor girl—without friends or fortune.—Thank heaven I have neither child nor wife to offend me; but, if I had, I don't know which I wou'd make the most obe∣dient.</P>
</SP>

<P>O yes—I have been in a closet before now—and under a bed too—but then I was never pull'd out by a <HI>husband</HI>; and, on a discovery, I cou'd always describe the something that brought me there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>By heaven, you are so taken with that joke, I cannot reserve that which I be∣fore hinted at from you any longer—Rat me if I have not an appointment for to-morrow even∣ing with Euston's <HI>other</HI> wife!—Is it not the most impudent thing of me—</P>

<P>The poor fellow thinks her as chaste as Diana; and so she is at present, as far as I know.—I was happy in her favor a few years ago—but, marriage not being then convenient, my passion was postponed—On her becoming Euston's wife, I renewed my addresses, and she has kindly allotted to-morrow evening for our first tête-à-tête.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Euston.</SPEAKER>
<P>BLESS my soul!—Bless my soul! Why, what did my brother Anthony say?—Was not he in a dreadful passion?—Only think of <HI>his</HI> being made such a fool of!—It would not have signified had it been <HI>me.</HI> It had been a good joke if the mistake had happened to me; then you wou'd have had something to have laughed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, let us think no more about it—my Uncle has listened to reason, and approves my conduct in every circumstance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, 'tis very well, George—'tis all very well—but I know, had you been his son, he wou'd not have forgiven you—he loved that boy so well he wou'd never forgive him the smallest fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very cruel proof of his af∣fection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, notwithstanding—you know it is—Poor Charles!—George you must do something for him—You know your Uncle won't—and I am tied from it by a solemn
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>promise. Many a letter and petition came from his wife to my brother and me, before we went abroad, but all in vain; for I had but just then given Anthony my word, and wou'd not equivocate, by causing the poor boy or his fa∣mily to be relieved, in any shape, through my means; and therefore I forebore to mention their distress to you—However, now, though I have not forgot my promise, I will not be so <HI>particular</HI> about it—and, when the deviation from my word disturbs my conscience, I'll hush it to rest with having relieved a destitute family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, Sir—I under∣stand you—and to find out my cousin and his family shall immediately be my care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON. (<HI>Shaking hands with Sir George.</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, George—Poor Charles is a Lieu∣tenant in the East Indies.—His wife must be the first object of your bounty—Just before I left England she wrote me a letter from a village near York—where he left her, with two chil∣dren, and she styles them, in her letter, "the offspring of want and wretchedness." I was a hard hearted fellow not to listen to her com∣plaint—but, I think, since I have been at sea, I have been more compassionate—I never knew, before, what it was to be cold or hungry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you tell me the name of the village, Sir, where I am to seek her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr, EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Write to her at the post-office, Selby—If she should have left the place, they may still know where to send her letters. I
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>wish some friend, that had not made a promise, would speak to my brother Anthony about them at present; perhaps, going to sea has changed his heart too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I touched on that subject when I was with him this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you?—Did you?—And what did he say?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Asked if I meant to make him forbid me his sight—and, on my apologising, commanded me never to mention my poor cou∣sin in his hearing again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that is what I must ne∣ver do—Well, so much the better—for now, George, neither you nor I can tell tales one of another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, Sir—Had my Uncle Anthony an estate to bestow on each of his family, he could not exact more obedience to his will than he does at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, George. But what keeps him so long away?—I expected he wou'd have been with your Lady before this time, acknowledging her for his niece: tho' they have had one meeting it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Uncle cannot be intro∣duced to Lady Euston till to-morrow, Sir. Lord Layton, for whom he settled some business when he was abroad, called on him just as I came away, and, as his Lordship is going to Italy in a
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>day or two, he entreated my Uncle to accom∣pany him immediately to his country house (about ten miles from town) in order to look over some papers he has there.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here comes your Lady, so I'll leave you.</P>

<P>Dear Mr. Euston, I hope I do not frighten you away—Sir George will be offended with me if I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam—I am sure no man cou'd be offended at being left in such charming company.</P>
</SP>

<P>My Uncle is grown a man of gallantry!</P>

<P>Yes, I inspire all the men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Euston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I insire all the men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'd I only inspire you with reason to listen to my arguments—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis in vain.—The Major shall now feel my resentment—Did he imagine, because I was indifferent to the conduct of an <HI>undesserving</HI> woman, that I am not to be roused at such an in∣jury as this?—An attempt on the principles of a woman of virtue!—'Tis done on purpose to try me, and by Heaven he shall find—That wretch too Sir Harry!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, pray have pity on poor Sir Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam.—I only defer my resentment till I have had some conversation with my Uncle Anthony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, my dear Sir George, suffer me to revenge my own cause this once—and ever after—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I positively must!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir George, in a year or two, I may, perhaps, have no objection to your sighting a duel—but only three months mar∣ried—I do wish to keep you a little longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, Lady Euston, death had never half the terrors I have beheld it with since I called you mine—but that life you have endeared to me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wou'd throw away im∣mediately in my service—No, no, Sir George, a fond wife will never suffer her husband to re∣venge her wrongs at so great a risk. Besides, the exertion of a little <HI>thought</HI> and <HI>fancy</HI> will more powerfully vindicate innocence, than that brilliant piece of steel, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly I am—Now, sup∣pose a gentleman makes love to me—I divulge the affront to you, you call my insulter to an ac∣count—<HI>Your</HI> ball misses; he fires into the air; and, to the same of having dared to wound your
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>honor, he gains that of presenting you with your life.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, why must these circum∣stances take place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, we will suppose he kills you; how do you like that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE. (<HI>Smiling</HI>)</SPEAKER>
<P>Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, we will suppose, you kill him—Even how do you like <HI>that?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I confess that, if a se∣vere punishment could be thought of, for such insolence—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is as severe a pun∣nishment to men of gallantry (as they call them∣selves) as sword or pistol; laugh at them—that is a ball which cannot miss; and yet kills only their vanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see—we have been now only three months married; and, in that short time, I have had no less than five or six men of fashion to turn into ridicule.—The first who ventured to declare his passion was Lord William Bloomly—his rank, joined to his un∣common beauty, had insured him success; and, wherever I went, I was certain to hear his dis∣tress whispered in my ear—at every opportunity he fell even upon his knees; and, as a tender earnest of my pity for him, begged, with all the eloquence of love, for "a single lock of my
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>hair, which he wou'd value more than any other woman's person; the wealth of worlds; or (he is a great patriot you know) even the welfare of his country."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am out of patience!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will be more so—For I promised him this single lock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did not!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I did—and added, with a blush, that I must insist on a few hairs from one of his eye-brows in return—which he absolutely refused;—and, on my urging it, was obliged to confess, "he valued that little brown arch more than the lock he had been begging for; con∣sequently, more than any woman's person; the wealth of worlds; or even the welfare of his country."—I immediately circulated this anec∣dote, and exhibited the gentleman, both as a gallant and a patriot; and now his Lordship's eye-brow, which was once the admiration, is be∣come the ridicule of every drawing-room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship then wou'd not menace your lover?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not—"You are the most beautiful woman I ever saw," said Lord <HI>Bandy</HI>; "and your Lordship is positively the most lovely of mankind"—"What eyes," cried he; "what hair," cried I; "what lips," con∣tinued he; "what teeth," added I; "what a hand and arm," said he; "and what a <HI>leg</HI> and <HI>foot,</HI>" said I—"Your Ladyship is jesting," was
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>his Lordship's last reply; and he has never since even paid me one compliment. Prudes censure my conduct—I am too free—while their favo∣rite, Lady Strenuous, in another corner of the ball-room, cries to <HI>her</HI> admirer—"Desist, my Lord, or my dear Sir Charles shall know that you dare thus to wound my ears with your li∣centious passion—if you ever presume to breath in again, I will acquaint him with it—depend upon it I will. <STAGE>(<HI>Sighs and languishes</HI>)</STAGE> Oh! you have destroyed my peace of mind for ever."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are too many such ladies, but no such wou'd I hazard my life for—that I have proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, upon my word, Sir George, even the virtuous wife, who wou'd not have some regard to her husband's <HI>life,</HI> as well as his <HI>honour,</HI> if I were a gentleman, I should not feel myself under many obligations to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wou'd protect both?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the guilty not escape—Now (with your consent) what must be the con∣fusion, shame, and disappointment, of my two masked lovers to-morrow evening—the brutal audacity of one, and isignificance of the other; both beneath <HI>your</HI> resentment, yet deserving ob∣jects of mine. And, indeed, Sir George, it is my fixed opinion that, the man who wou'd en∣deavour to wrong a virtuous wife shou'd be held too despicable for the resentment of the husband, and only worthy the debasement inflicted by our sex. I have already sent a letter to Sir Harry
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>with the appointment at the masquerade, and the Major has my promise of a meeting at the same time—Come, come, Sir George, it is the first petition I ever presented; do not refuse me!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me till the morning to consider of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart—and in the mean time reflect on this—that, in regard to your terrible sex, whether as licentious lovers or valiant champions—women, of <HI>real honour,</HI> are not in danger from the one; and, therefore, like me, ought to forego the assistance of the other.</P>

<P>My good friend, I was just going to bed—but I am glad of your company, though I did not expect it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, my errand at this time was merely to ask a favour of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Command it, and you will make me proud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Colonel, with Lord Layton to-day (at whose house I dined)
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>a circumstance happened on which account I expect his Lordship will call on me to-morrow for a fashionable satisfaction; and though, de∣pend upon it, I wish for no such rash means of ending a dispute, yet, if his Lordship <HI>shou'd</HI> call upon me, 'tis fit I be prepared with a second; and I thank you for the friendly assurance you have now given me of your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are as welcome to it—I was going to say, as my king—but, zounds, if I shou'd be killed in a pitiful quarrel at home, I shou'd blush even in my grave—for, when I die, I hope to have my knell rung by the groans of a score or two of our country's treacherous foes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The service I shall put you to, Colonel, will not prevent that hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what, for Hea∣ven's sake, has brought you into a quarrel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cause of our quarrel was—you will call it a very trivial one, I dare say—a woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my old friend, you have not been quarrelling about a woman—Oh, if I shou'd be kill'd for a woman, I shou'd cut a noble figure, indeed!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, Colonel, hear me—and, as you may question my prudence, let me tell you the whole adventure.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, I did not mean to question your prudence, nor to speak
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>against the women either. I like them as well as you do—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I have a respect for their sex, which unites me to them as their father, their friend, and admirer.—And I beg you will give me your sentiments upon the cha∣racter of one whose behaviour, this day, has surprised me beyond measure—I will describe it to you, and you will then tell me whether you believe me imposed upon, or whether you think she really clims that extraordinary atten∣tion I have, some how, been compelled to give her.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Layton and I had no sooner plac'd ourselves in his Lordship's coach than he exclaim'd, he had just seen the most beautiful girl his eyes ever beheld, to whom he had given a look of solicitation, and that she was returning her answer by making up to the coach—He begged a thousand pardons, but, with my permission, (as he ex∣pected no other company at his country house) he wou'd take her down to dine with us.—I, knowing his Lordship well, (and the girl being now arrived at the coach door) reluctantly as∣sented, and she was immediately handed in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, he shou'd have taken a companion for you too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't interrupt me.—
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>When she had been seated about a minute, I cast my eyes upon her.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath, I shou'd not have staid half so long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was struck with her beau∣ty—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And wished his Lordship out of the way, I suppose.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—no.—There was a senfibility in her countenance that amazed me—blushes on her cheeks—tears in her eyes—When his Lordship spoke to her, she answer'd him with a forced smile, and a tremor on her voice.—She avoided all conversation; and, when we alighted, I handed her out of the coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I thought how it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>

<P>If you interrupt me, Sir, you shall hear no more.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, had you seen her coun∣tenance, so expressive of anguish! —The hope with which she lifted up her eyes to me, for deliverance!—The horror painted in her face, when I left the room! Heard her piercing cries, that called me back to her protection? The despair and earnest supplication that hung upon her tongue, while she entreated him to view her, not as an object of <HI>love,</HI> but <HI>charity</HI>!—The grief! the pathetic tenoerness with which she declared herself, "a virtuous though forsaken wife!—A poor, indigent, forlorn mother; pe∣rishing, with her children,— for whose sake she had been tempted by the first lure that offered (prompted by more than common grief) to add the sense of guilt to all her other miseries!"—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She hung upon me; and, in spite of his menaces, I led her to my coach, (which was then come for me) and brought her safe away.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope she got safe home too.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly so—As her tears interrupted her, whenever she attempted to tell me where she lived, or explain any cir∣cumstance of her life to me, I asked no ques∣tions, but took her to my own house—desired my house-keeper to show her an apartment, and treat her with attention—and, promising to see and speak with her in the morning, left her to the repose which she must greatly want.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now you think his Lordship will send <HI>you</HI> to repose, for all this.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know I am an object of suspicion—but you are deceived in me—indeed you are.—Guilt never <HI>harboured</HI> in my heart.—Maternal tenderness, for two helpless infants, hurried me in a moment to do I know not what, rather than lose them.—A deed! the horror of which (al∣tho' by the mercy of eternal Providence I have escaped its direst consequences) must ever cover me with blushes; and, shou'd indulgent heaven reserve me for a meeting with my husband, must, with remorse, damp every joy the fond, fond, interview would give!</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, I have a husband, <HI>I think,</HI> who loves me.—Once I am sure the did.—<HI>My</HI> heart has never stray'd from <HI>him,</HI> since our fatal union.—What must that poor heart suffer, torn with remorse for the rash step my mad despair sggested to preserve my children?—Oh! in my

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reasons have satisfied me—I do not ask your name.—Tell me but the <HI>circumstances</HI> that dróve you to the state from whence I released you—Be so far explicit, and I will ask no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly.—When first my husband saw me, I was friendless.—Com∣passion caused his love for me—Gratitude mine for him.—Forlorn and destitute, no kind relation, no tender benefactor taught my heart affection.—Unused to all the little offices of kindness, could they but endear the object who bestowed them?—Sense of obligation, never before excited, pressed on my thoughts, and soon was changed to love.—He scorned to violate the heart that was his own, and we were married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find no room for accusa∣tion here.—Go on—go on, Madam.—What has alienated your husband from you, and left you thus destitute at present?—If you can re∣solve me that—if you still have acted with equal propriety, I am your friend—I have no censure for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will condemn my husband—even I must own <HI>he</HI> was to blame. Born of wealthy parents, the heir to large possessions, and I to none, when he married, all were given up, and he changed his state for mine.—We had no friend but in each other—yet happy was that state to
<PB N="66" REF="74"/><HI>me,</HI> till poverty surprised us; and the fond hope (which once he cherished) of paternal forgive∣ness, vanished from my husband.—Then all our days were bitter as they had before been happy—tears were my only food, and sighs were his—even <HI>reproach</HI> I have endured from him, for making him the friendless wretch he call'd him∣slef.—Yet—yet, at our parting, oh! then he cancell'd all—for when the regiment, in which he served, was ordered from the kingdom, he hung upon me, clasped his poor children, begg'd our forgiveness for the thousand outrages distress at our misfortunes had caused him to commit—swore that affection for us was the source of his impatience—prayed heaven to bless <HI>us,</HI> what∣ever might be his fate—nay, prayed that death might speedily be his doom, so that it turned his father's heart to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you never ap∣ply'd to his father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but all in vain; and two months since, hearing my husband was made prisoner, (and destitute of every relief and eve∣ry hope while he remained so) I left my children and came to London, resolved, in <HI>person,</HI> to supplicate his father's bounty; when I learnt (dire news) his father, visiting an estate abroad, was lost, and we left to despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say?</P>
</SP>

<P>To give him this letter, Bloom, from Lady Euston to the Major, which you so luckily found, and to have the extreme pleasure of informing him that I am not the only object deserving his resentment—but that even his wife of a few months—she whom the world says he doats upon, and who has driven me from his remembrance, is indiscreet as I have

<P>I have been waiting for you all day—What meant the few words in your letter?—Why is my meeting with his Lordship deferred?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am just come from Lord Layton—a friend of his Lordship's, know∣ing I was acquainted with you, call'd and took me there—and, to tell you the truth, I think this business between you and his Lordship might be amicably and honorably settled—However, if you don't fight with <HI>him,</HI> you must fight with a mad headed fellow I have left below—so which do you choose?</P>

<P>Nay, you will have a worse chance than you wou'd have had with his Lordship; for this man is a soldier, one who has been fighting for these four or five years past—besides, he's desperate—half mad; and has sworn, he'll either kill or be kill'd by you, <HI>in∣stantly.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what's his business? What is his quarrel with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Layton is the innocent cause of it—he told the young man, who came to his Lordship's (somewhat sooner than I did) in search of the Lady whom you took away, that the Lady had confessed herself poor—and even perishing for subsistence—and that, consequently, she was willing to resign herself to the most liberal—which you proving, in spite of his Lordship's generosity, you carried off the prize—and, egad, I owned it was what I had suspected, notwithstanding your grave coun∣tenance last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You told him you thought so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
<SPEAKER>Colonel DOWNRIGHT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—for I wished to turn the whole matter into a joke with his Lordship—I did not think, at the time, that the young fellow wou'd have been so violent—for till this was explained he was as patient as a lamb; and only inquired, with <HI>trembling</HI> and <HI>sighs,</HI> for the Lady—but, when he heard what I said, egad, he laid hold of me, and swore, till I brought him to my friend, the "unpitying, vile purchaser of innocence," (meaning you) he wou'd not quit me—So here he has followed me through the streets—and, on condition that he wou'd be patient while I came and announced him to you, I have promised him you shall give him satis∣faction.</P>

<P>What? Do <HI>you</HI> weep?—Now that affects me more than any thing that has been said or done yet.—I don't like to see a woman cry, but I can't bear to see a man—a man's tears flow from so deep a source—they always appear to have come a long journey, and therefore I notice them as strangers, that have gone through fatigue, and trouble, on their way—While a woman's tears I consider as mere neighbours, that can call upon you when they like, and generally drop in on all occasions.</P>

<P>How strange does it seem to me to find myself once more in this house, es∣pecially when I consider who resides here—Who?

<P>Come, come, Mr. Anthony Euston, confess you were not brought hither to

<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Major Cyprus!—My brother Anthony knew no more of the appointment at the masquerade than the child unborn.—But, bless you, my niece and we meant you no ill by it; we only meant to have a joke at your and Sir Harry's expence—that was all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Lady Euston, you have cause to reproach him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear he will rather reproach me for this abrupt intrusion—but my appre∣hensions for his safety (hearing no tidings from his uncle's) have alone impell'd me to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HABRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had your Ladyship not written this letter to the amiable Sir Harry Harmless, (which I unfortunately supposed in∣tended for Major Cyprus) your Ladyship's alarm∣ing "apprehensions" might have been spared, as I sent for Sir George but to shew him this letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that letter was only a joke—a scheme to mortify the Major and Sir Harry.</P>

<P>It was so—I own it.—And the confusion the scheme has occasioned, Sir George, needs all your forgiveness.</P>

<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sincerely pardon it—and hope the whole company will do me the justice to believe that my sole motive, for entering this house, was a compliance with, what I then thought, the dying request of that Lady.—And I now believe that her Ladyship's sole motive for wishing to see me was merely to shew me the etter of which she speaks—a copy of which, not without my knowledge, but against my opinion, was written by Lady euston to Major Cy∣prus, appointing a fictitious interview, in return for his having dared to offend her with the pro∣fession of a licentious passion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major CYPRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir George, I am perfectly satisfied with this explantation.—But, after what has happened, the world may despise me for be∣ing so, and therefore, Lady Harriet, from this moment we separate—And we had been wifer, as well as happier, if we had never met.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly separate—Your unkind treatment—and my own constant in∣quietude—have long since taught a woman of the world too feelingly to acknowledge, "No lasting friendship is form'd on vice."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Preach this, my dear Lady, to all your fair countrywomen—enforce your words by your future conduct, and they shall draw a veil over the frailty of your past life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Mr.Anthony, cou'd I but retrieve my innocence, my honour, for ever lost!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, do not despair.—You can still possess <HI>one</HI> inestimable good—that in∣born
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>virtue which <HI>never perishes</HI>—which never leaves us but to return.—For, when you think it extinguished, feel but due remorse and it rises again in the soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, brother Antho∣ny—comfort her—it is your duty.—And we are all <HI>relations,</HI> you know—the whole company are related to one another.—Though it is in an odd kind of a jumbled way—I wish some learned gentleman, of the law, would tell us <HI>what</HI> rela∣tions we all are—and what relation the child of a first husband is to his mother's second husband, while his own father is living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. ANTHONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, you think too deeply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. EUSTON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, brother Anthony!—And, for fear the gentlemen of the long robe shou'd not be able to find out the present company's <HI>affinity,</HI> let us apply to the <HI>kindred ties</HI> of each others passions, weaknesses, and imperfec∣tions; and, thereupon, agree to part, this evening, not only <HI>near relations</HI> but <HI>good friends.</HI></P>
