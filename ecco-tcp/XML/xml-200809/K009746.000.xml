<P>IT would be unjust to send the following Pieces into the World, without acknowledging the high Respect I have for Mr. M'PHERSON's great Abilities; since he has a very particular Right to share in the Reputation these Poems may chance to acquire; the Versification being made from his elegant and spirited Prose Translation of <HI>Ossian</HI>'s inimitable Performances. That we have them preserved from being swallowed up in the Gulph of Ob∣livion, is owing to his fine Discernment, and incomparable Industry.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE EARL of POMFRET.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am seldom inclined to think much of my own little Abilities, I cannot help feeling some Vanity, when their Essays are crown'd with the Approba∣tion of so great a Master in the Belles Lettres, as your Lord∣ship. To be able to engage the Attention, or acquire the Patronage of the Earl of POMFRET, implies Merit: Since to the many Virtues which reflect Honour upon elevated Rank, he adds deep Penetration, strong Judgment, well digested Learning, and a Taste truly elegant.</P>
<P>I should think myself, My Lord, ungrateful if I omitted this Opportunity of assuring you, I shall always retain a deep Sense of the very particular Favours you have been pleased to confer upon me. Among the happiest Hours of my Life, those must stand foremost, in which I have had the Honour of being admitted to your Lordship's Conversation, from which I never arose without considerable Improve∣ment; an Increase of which it shall be my utmost Ambi∣tion to deserve.</P>
<P>It was the good Fortune of the following Pieces to please you in Manuscript, they therefore intreat to be in∣troduced to the public Light under the Sanction of your Lordship's Protection; an Honour which, among many other Obligations, shall be always acknowledg'd, with due Respect, by, My Lord,</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FINGAL, King of <HI>Morven,</HI> returning Home vic∣torious from the Expedition in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which is ce∣lebrated in the Epic Poem bearing his Name, made a Feast, to which all his Chiefs, <HI>Ma-ronnan</HI> and <HI>Aldo</HI> ex∣cepted, were invited. The Neglect seems to have been accidental; however they resented it so strongly as to aban∣don their native Country, and enter into the Service of <HI>Erragon,</HI> King of <HI>Sora,</HI> a Name given to some Part of <HI>Scandinavia.</HI> Here <HI>Lorma,</HI> the beautiful Wife of <HI>Erragon,</HI> seeing <HI>Aldo</HI> by chance, his Reputation as a Warrior being very high, fell in Love with him. He return'd her Pas∣sion, and they fled into <HI>Morven. Erragon</HI> pursuing them, invaded that Kingdon with a powerful Force, and slew <HI>Aldo</HI> in single Combat, but was himself slain by <HI>Gaul,</HI> the Son of <HI>Morni,</HI> and his Army defeated. This is the Sub∣ject of the ensuing Poem, which is beautiful, sentimental, and interesting. It was deliver'd by <HI>Ossian,</HI> after becom∣ing blind, to a <HI>Culdee,</HI> or Christian Hermit, who led a recluse Life near him, and whose Sacred Hymns he ima∣gined were composed in Honour of his deceased Chiefs, or Addresses to the Spirits in the Air.</P>

<LG>
<L>SON of the distant Land, within whose Cell,</L>
<L>Calm Peace and Heavenly Contemplation dwell,</L>
<L>What Notes of warbling Melody are these,</L>
<L>That pierce <HI>thy</HI> Grove and sigh upon the Breeze?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="5">Tho' loud th' impetuous Torrent in mine Ear,</L>
<L>The Voice of Songs, a tuneful Voice I hear.</L>
<L>Perhaps you call your Country's Chiefs to mind;</L>
<L>Or praise the Spirits in the posting Wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Son of the Rock, cast o'er the Plain thine Eyes;</L>
<L N="10">Among the Heath thou see'st green Tombs arise,</L>
<L>The rank Grass whistles round, and rising Stones,</L>
<L>Mark the sad Spot where lie the Heroe's Bones.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, lonely Dweller of the Rock, can'st see;</L>
<L>But ah! that Blessing is not left to me;</L>
<L N="15">In vain these Eyes roll round in search of Light,</L>
<L>For <HI>Ossian</HI>'s Eyes are quench'd in endless Night.</L>
<L>Down pours the Mountain Stream from yonder Source,</L>
<L>And round the green Hill forms its winding Course;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Tufted with Moss, four Stones their Tops uprear,</L>
<L N="20">Above the wither'd Grass; two Trees are near,</L>
<L>Their heavy Branches bent beneath the Storm;</L>
<L>Here sleeps, dread <HI>Erragon,</HI> thy mould'ring Form!</L>
<L>Thee, <HI>Erragon,</HI> this narrow House contains!</L>
<L>No more thy Shell resounds thro' <HI>Sora</HI>'s Plains;</L>
<L N="25">No more wilt thou the Sword in Battle wield;</L>
<L>Dark in thy Hall, and useless hangs thy Shield;</L>
<L>Scarce is thy Blood upon our Mountains dry,</L>
<L>Sovereign of Ships—and low the Valiant lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lov'st thou the Song, Son of the secret Cell;</L>
<L N="30">Attend, while <HI>Lora</HI>'s bloody Fight I tell;</L>
<L>Tho' long forgotten on the spacious Plain,</L>
<L>And scarce the Marks of ruthless War remain;</L>
<L>So when hoarse Thunders bellow thro' the Sky,</L>
<L>A thousand Spirits from the Caves reply,</L>
<L N="35">Blue Lightnings round the Hills of <HI>Morven</HI> play,</L>
<L>Gleaming pale Horrors on the doubtful Day;</L>
<L>Gradual the Storm subsides, the Horizon clears,</L>
<L>A settled Calm the faded Landscape cheers,</L>
<L>The golden Sun revives the drooping Isle,</L>
<L N="40">The rough Rocks glitter and the Mountains smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From <HI>Ullin</HI>'s rolling Waves we steer'd our Way,</L>
<L>Our Ships now enter'd <HI>Cona</HI>'s spacious Bay;</L>
<L>Loose hung our Sails; we spurn'd the foaming Flood,</L>
<L>And heard the Tempest howl thro' <HI>Morven</HI>'s Wood.</L>
<L N="45">The King's Horn sounds,—at once the startled Deer,</L>
<L>Rous'd from their Coverts, fled the Danger near.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Thick pour'd our Arrows, and the festal Board</L>
<L>Was soon with Choice of smoaking Viands stor'd;</L>
<L>Blith on the Rocks we revel'd in Delight,</L>
<L N="30"><HI>Swaran,</HI> our mortal Foe, had fallen in Fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two Heroes at the Feast had been forgot,</L>
<L>Their bosoms burn'd with Rage and blackening Thought;</L>
<L>In secret round they glanc'd their kindled Eyes,</L>
<L>Their Indignation spoke in bursting Sighs.</L>
<L N="55">Close they conferr'd, they threw their Spears to Earth;</L>
<L>Obscuring, like two murky Clouds, our Mirth.</L>
<L>So on the settled Sea blue Mists arise.</L>
<L>In vapory Volumes darkening to the Skies;</L>
<L>They glitter in the Sun; but Seamen fear</L>
<L N="60">The Lustre short, and rising Tempests near.</L>
<L>" Loose my white Sails, we'll catch the Western Breeze."</L>
<L><HI>Maronnan</HI> spoke, "We'll plough the Northern Seas,</L>
<L>" We fought his Battles,—<HI>Aldo</HI> yet forgot</L>
<L>" At <HI>Fingal</HI>'s Feast.—Since such our injur'd Lot</L>
<L N="65">" To Foreign Lands, we'll bear our martial Might,</L>
<L>" And strengthen <HI>Erragon</HI> in dubious Fight;</L>
<L>" His Post is Terror, and his Eyes are Flame,</L>
<L>" War points his Spear, and Death attends his Name,</L>
<L>" His ecchoing Battles shall our Swords renown,</L>
<L N="70">" And with immortal Wreaths of Glory crown."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Snatching their Swords and Shields, they quickly sought,</L>
<L><HI>Lumar</HI>'s wish'd Bay, and to the Shore were brought,</L>
<L>Just as returning from the Chace was seen,</L>
<L>The chief of bounding Steeds, of haughty Mein.</L>
<L N="75"><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Gloom wrapp'd his Face, he murm'ring as he went,</L>
<L>A smother'd Song, seem'd lost in dark Intent.</L>
<L>Gladly the Strangers at his Feasts he saw,</L>
<L>And to his Foes their glittering Arms gave Law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Brave <HI>Aldo</HI> once returning from the Fight,</L>
<L N="80">Was seen by <HI>Lorma, Erragon</HI>'s Delight,</L>
<L>His beauteous Wife,—and then in luckless Hour,</L>
<L>She first acknowledg'd Love's imperious Power.</L>
<L><HI>Aldo</HI> she saw, but like an Evening Sun,</L>
<L>Glancing an upward Beam, his Race now run;</L>
<L N="85">Her Head she lean'd on her right Arm reclin'd;</L>
<L>Her dark-brown Locks loose floated in the Wind;</L>
<L>Still as she look'd, high heav'd her Breasts of Snow,</L>
<L>Quick throbb'd her Heart, and Tears unbidden flow;</L>
<L>The pearly Drop her new-born Passion spoke,</L>
<L N="90">And in the Air in Sighs her Sorrows broke.</L>
<L>Three Days she pin'd; dissembled Joy her Grief</L>
<L>Conceal'd; the Fourth came wing'd with kind Relief,</L>
<L>The Hero clasp'd her in his vigorous Arms,</L>
<L>And o'er the briny Flood convey'd her Charms,</L>
<L N="95">To <HI>Cona</HI>'s Bay, to <HI>Fingal</HI>'s lofty Tower;</L>
<L>There safe from <HI>Erragon</HI>'s vindictive Power.</L>
<L>When lo! in Wrath, <HI>the King of Morven</HI> rose,</L>
<L>And said, "Shall I defend thee from thy Foes?</L>
<L>" What! shall <HI>Fingal</HI> a Ravisher befriend?</L>
<L N="100">" Proud-hearted <HI>Aldo,</HI> how can I defend?</L>
<L>" Who will my People in their Halls receive?</L>
<L>" The Feast of Strangers who hereafter give?</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9"/>
" Hence, Youth of feeble Hand, avoid the Brave!</L>
<L>" Thy Guilt conceal in some deserted Cave,</L>
<L N="105">" While we prepare with <HI>Sora</HI>'s King to fight,</L>
<L>" Who threatens like black Tempests in the Night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Spirit of noble <HI>Trenmor,</HI> say shall Peace</L>
<L>" Ne'er bless my Age? Shall <HI>Fingal</HI> never cease</L>
<L>" From War's Alarms? but born amid the Fight</L>
<L N="110">" Must Blood his Progress mark to endless Night?</L>
<L>" Yet never were the Weak by me distrest,</L>
<L>" Never my Sword the unequal Combat prest.</L>
<L>" Oh! <HI>Morven,</HI> yes, thy raging Storms I know,</L>
<L>" In Time my stately Towers shall overthrow,</L>
<L N="115">" When of my Children all in Battle slain,</L>
<L>" Nought but their Tombs shall on the Heath remain;</L>
<L>" When none survive the noble Youths to mourn,</L>
<L>" When none in <HI>Selma</HI>'s mouldering Shades sojourn;</L>
<L>" Feeble in Arms, perhaps, a Race may come,</L>
<L N="120">" Who scarce will know where rises <HI>Fingal</HI>'s Tomb;</L>
<L>" Yet in the Song shall flourish his Renown;</L>
<L>" In Song to future Times transmitted down."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As round the turbid Spirits of the Night,</L>
<L>Are summon'd to convene on <HI>Morven</HI>'s Height,</L>
<L N="125">The gath'ring Tempests in vindictive Hour,</L>
<L>Which he prepares on foreign Realms to pour.</L>
<L>Round <HI>Erragon,</HI> now landed on the Coast,</L>
<L>Embodied close so roll'd his martial Host,</L>
<L>While to the <HI>King of Shields</HI> his Bard he sent,</L>
<L N="130">Charging him thus to utter his Intent:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10"/>
" Tell him the Fight of Thousands we demand;</L>
<L>" Or else Possession of his hilly Land."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sovereign sitting in his Hall was found,</L>
<L>The grave Companions of his Youth around;</L>
<L N="135">For the young <HI>Heroes,</HI> Thunderbolts of War,</L>
<L>Were at the Chace, or in the Desart far.</L>
<L>The Sages told what other Times had seen,</L>
<L>And what their Deeds in earlier Days had been:</L>
<L>When <HI>Narthmor,</HI> King of streamy <HI>Lora</HI> came,</L>
<L N="140">Strong, tho' in Years, and of illustrious Name.</L>
<L>" This is no Time," began the Chief, "to hear</L>
<L>" The Song of other Days, the Foe so near;</L>
<L>" Fierce <HI>Erragon</HI> advances on the Strand,</L>
<L>" And lifts ten thousand Swords against the Land;</L>
<L N="145">" Among his Chiefs he stalks with gloomy Pace,</L>
<L>" Like the dark Moon when Meteors shroud her Face."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Come Daughter of my Love," then said <HI>Fingal,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>Bosmina</HI> come from thy sequester'd Hall.</L>
<L>" The rough War threatens; be it thine to save</L>
<L N="150">" The Land from Blood, the Soldier from the Grave.</L>

<L>" The Wealth of <HI>Aldo</HI> at his Feet we lay;</L>
<L N="155">" Take thou the Stranger's Steeds,—they are not slow,</L>
<L>" <HI>Narthmor,</HI> and with the Maid of <HI>Morven</HI> go.</L>
<L>" <HI>Bosmina</HI> haste, our Youths are distant far,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<L>To <HI>Sora</HI>'s gazing Bands <HI>Bosmina</HI> bright</L>
<L N="160">Shone forth, as on a Cloud a Beam of Light;</L>
<L>Her left Hand with a sparkling Shell was grac'd,</L>
<L>A Golden Arrow in her Right was plac'd.</L>
<L>As when the Solar Rays a Passage find,</L>
<L>Thro' envious Clouds, rent by the rising Wind,</L>
<L N="165">The Vale rejoices in the genial Heat,</L>
<L>Smiling the King advanced the Maid to meet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, mildly blushing, she began to speak,</L>

<L N="185">" Ten Shells with Gems inlaid, which ours we call,</L>

<LG>
<L>" Soft Voice of <HI>Cona,</HI>" <HI>Sora</HI>'s King reply'd,</L>
<L>" Tell him he does in vain the Feast provide,</L>
<L>" Unless he bow to my superior Sway,</L>
<L N="200">" And at my Feet his Spoils submissive lay;</L>
<L>" The Shields of other Times let him resign,</L>

<L N="215">Now <HI>Selma</HI>'s towering Walls <HI>Bosmina</HI> sought,</L>

<L>His Father's Shield.—Darkness o'er <HI>Selma</HI> spread,</L>
