<P>THE MAN OF TEN THOUSAND A COMEDY.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of Major Rampart was intend∣ed to represent one of those persons who imagine they have uttered volumes, without having said a word: whose eager looks inform us how important they suppose their own conceptions to be; but, being too mighty for utterance, language sinks under them, and they expect the assent and ap∣plause of their companions to their Humphs? Hays? and expletives. These expletives, as used by the Major, are omitted in representation; be∣cause they offended. They are here restored, and left to the consideration of the reader. It may be necessary to add, they should not be pronoun∣ced in an articulate and emphatical manner; but with a half-muttering rapidity: accompanied by equally rapid glances, looking round for, and de∣manding, admiration.</P>

<P>I chanced to affirm at Laudohn's Levee (I served the Emperor at that time) to affirm that Frederic the Great commanded the right wing, in person, at the battle of Prague. Mein Herr, said Von Dondertronc, very respectfully taking off his hat (I give you his manner and phrase) Mein Herr, you am a committa mistake a. Carnage and gun∣powder, General, said I, interrupting him, do you mean to tell me that I am mistaken? Von Dondertronc was as daring as he was polite.

<P>I must be going. Good morning. But it is very true: rank will carry it against riches.

<P>To be sure. What does a hero, like you, mind the loss of a few thousands? Your half∣souled fellows, on such an occasion, will take opium over night, and a pistol the next morning: but you brush such trifles from your mind, as your footman does powder from your coat.</P>

<P>This dear friend of yours is in full spirits.</P>

<P>I never knew him otherwise. A very magpie; always hopping and chattering. 'Tis a quality I like in him.</P>
</SP>

<P>Is there any other quality for which you like him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; his frank honest satire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>To torment is his study.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he is a master of the art: a proof of his genius.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>He spares neither friend nor foe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he did, I should despise him. What
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
the heart thinks let the tongue utter. Knaves and cowards only fear its freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has made tolerably free with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. I am fair game; and he is a fair sportsman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not too much of that. He advises me to break with you; and offers to dignify me with a coronet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! There is merit even in his impudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are you not offended with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you esteem me so little?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie! I esteem you so much. Your under∣standing is of too high an order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>To marry him, when I may have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frank, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. I despise hypocrisy. Why not as freely speak good of myself, when I think it, as of another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or ill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; or ill. I have faults as many as you please: but I have something that will hide them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not too confident. A single cloud will conceal the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a mistake. A few acres I grant may be overcast; but his rays, at the same instant, shine refulgent on the remaining world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Less poetry, and more prudence, might perhaps be as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in your eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem very certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I am of my own heart, which beats in unison with yours; or I never could have admired,
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
never could have loved you as I do. I confess your coldness this morning a little surprises me; and might alarm, were I less acquainted with the justice and the dignity of your mind. My last night's follies offend; and with reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are indefensible; they are degrading; and yet, comparatively, they are trifles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>The loss of wealth only strips vanity of her plumes: but the loss of principle covers us with contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>To preserve our good temper, when the profligate and the absurd surround us, is as worthy of the sage as the man of the world: but to smile approbation, to ape their hypocrisy, and be the high priest of their nocturnal orgies, is to be ambi∣tious of infamy; and to renounce the love and the society of the good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>A dreadful sentence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>But inevitable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am now in haste; but, in the course of the evening, I will call, listen to reproof, kiss the rod, and adore the chastiser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may happen not to be at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll venture that. Good morrow. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oli.</SPEAKER>
<P>This self confidence is insulting! Con∣scious as he is of a dissipated spirit, male coquetry, and depravity of manners, can he so familiarly talk of the unison of our hearts? When he is present, he fascinates! I have but one resource: I will avoid him! Former affection shall not subject me to future wretchedness.

Your vast domains loaded with vegetation, incredible to tell, were torn up and whirled like chaff to the clouds; leaving be∣hind mephitic lakes, whose stench infects the air!

<P>Bugbears for children!

<P>Rather by our own endeavours. Equal to every change the man of fortitude remains un∣moved, when, most depressed, feebler spirits sink; or, most exalted, flutter. In prosperity he exults not: he shrinks not from adversity. He doubts if there be adversity; except to the impotent and un∣wise. Souls are distinguished by their qualities; and the day of assault is, to him, the fortunate day in which he proves his rank.</P>

<L>TO whining prone, to sighs and sobs and tears,</L>
<L>How much is man the creature of his fears!</L>
<L>Hence grief and lamentation long have been</L>
<L>The serious subject of the comic scene.</L>
<L>Nor knew the hero of the doleful tale</L>
<L>To meet mischance: he knew but to bewail!</L>
<L>Each wind of heaven some swift destruction brought.</L>
<L>The willing slave of every brain-sick thought,</L>
<L>He hunts for woe! For plagues capitulates!</L>
<L>And those he cannot find he soon creates.</L>
<L>The thousand joys he has are all despised:</L>
<L>The toy he cannot get alone is prized:</L>
<L>Give him but wealth, poor churl, he frets and frowns!</L>
<L>Take it away, poor wretch, he hangs or drowns!</L>
<L>Pursued by phantoms, through life's troubled day,</L>
<L>Coward and fool go with him all the way.</L>

<L>In conscious rectitude confirmed, and bold,</L>
<L>To-night appears a man of different mould:</L>
<L>Who meets misfortune; fate defies; and braves</L>
<L>The rolling thunder; and the surging waves:</L>
<L>Rides safe among the rocks, though tempest-tost,</L>
<L>Where many a tall-built bark lies wrecked and lost.</L>
<L>Poetically rides: but—Thought of fear!</L>
<L>Should one more hurricane o'ertake him, here,</L>
<L>Should bursting yells and howls, from yonder skies,</L>
<L>Bid the wild billows of damnation rise,</L>

Courage and skill in vain the storm oppose,</L>
<L>He founders in the gulph, and down he goes!</L>

<L>But should you take the helm, and kindly please</L>

<L>Who cultivates the arts by which he's grac'd,</L>
<L>Sports his half-boots; buttons his half-great coat;</L>

<L>With bludgeon arm'd, to knock down those that laugh,</L>
