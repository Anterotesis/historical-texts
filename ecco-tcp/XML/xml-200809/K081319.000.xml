<HEAD>ACT THE FIRST. SCENE I. — Chambers in the Temple.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Tom Careless <HI>and</HI> Mr. Cycle.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>WHATE'ER the success of your journey may be,</L>
<L>My dear rural sage, you are welcome to me:</L>
<L>Your benevolent projects I hope you'll complete,</L>
<L>By this trip from your snug scientific retreat.</L>
<L>In return for amusement you've given me there,</L>
<L>By your fine apparatus, and lectures on air,</L>
<L>I'll shew you the town; and the town is a science.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>On my tutor, dear Tom, I've a perfect reliance,</L>
<L>For I know in that study what vigils you've kept.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis the only one, truly, where I'm an adept;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>For as to the law, that's the science of thorns,</L>
<L>And tho' its black robe my lean figure adorns,</L>
<L>Perhaps twice a year, for my father's good pleasure,</L>
<L>I've renounc'd, I confess, both its toil and its treasure.</L>
<L>From my sapient Lord Coke this advantage I gain;</L>
<L>He led me to find out a flaw in my brain,</L>
<L>That title! on which, as wise parents have done,</L>
<L>My father laid claim to the seals for his son.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such language, dear Tom, is in truth but a brogue,</L>
<L>That betrays the young heir as an indolent rogue.</L>
<L>'Tis the cant of ye all—ye want talents to drudge.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! think me, my friend, wise enough for a judge,</L>
<L>I still must rejoice I have nothing to do,</L>
<L>As my heart now inclines me to wait upon you.</L>
<L>I wish I could raise you the cash you require,</L>
<L>But you know I depend on a close-handed sire,</L>
<L>Who promises largely, and often has said</L>
<L>He will make me a Croesus whenever I wed;</L>
<L>But to drive me, I think, to the conjugal state,</L>
<L>Keeps the purse of the batchelor woefully strait;</L>
<L>And guineas at present are scarce, to my sorrow.</L>
<L>How much are you now come to London to borrow?</L>
<L>Two thousand, d'ye say?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! two thousand at least,</L>
<L>And perhaps rather more, as my plan is increas'd.</L>
<L>I wish for no profit, but public esteem;</L>
<L>And much good to the world must arise from my scheme.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! I wish you may prosper, but, as I'm a sinner,</L>
<L>I as soon should expect a roast Phoenix for dinner,</L>
<L>As in times like the present such loans from a friend,</L>
<L>When Opulence has not a stiver to lend.</L>
<L>You philosophers look with contempt upon cash;</L>
<L>But the fools of this town are so fond of the trash,</L>
<L>That as you're a chemist, both skilful and bold,</L>
<L>You had best try to make a few odd lumps of gold;</L>
<L>And this newly-found art you may try with less cost,</L>
<L>Since to borrow with ease seems an art that is lost.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Careless, you're welcome to rally my hopes;</L>
<L>So attack them with all your rhetorical tropes!</L>
<L>The man is ill-wrapt in philosophy's cloak,</L>
<L>Whose bosom is ruffled, dear Tom, by a joke.</L>
<L>I know money's scarce; yet I will not despond:</L>
<L>I've two friends who'll supply what I want, on my bond.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! <HI>two</HI> such good friends; so rich, open, and free!</L>
<L>Dear Cycle, I pray introduce them to me;</L>
<L>For not one of that cast my long list can produce:</L>
<L>Why! man, such a friend is the golden-egg'd goose;</L>
<L>You may hunt for the bird e'en as long as you're able,</L>
<L>But at last you will find it is only a fable.</L>
<L>I wanted but one hundred pounds, t'other day,</L>
<L>And ask'd fifty friends, that chance threw in my way,</L>
<L>But they all shook their heads, with a negative nod,</L>
<L>So I dunn'd my old father, in spite of the rod.</L>
<L>But pray do I know the good creatures you mean?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye! both.—They're two friends, whom for years I've not seen;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>But in juvenile days I held each as my brother,</L>
<L>And I trust that we all are still dear to each other.</L>
<L>You're acquainted with Beril—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well! there, I confess;</L>
<L>Your wishes have some little chance of success.</L>
<L>If there's one in the world, who, regardless of pelf,</L>
<L>Would relieve a friend's wants, tho' he straiten'd himself;</L>
<L>You have now nam'd the man. Yet perhaps he can't lend:</L>
<L>I know he has suffer'd by aiding a friend;</L>
<L>And I fancy he has but a slender estate.</L>
<L>'Tis true, he don't play, tho' carest by the great;</L>
<L>Yet in statues and books he's expensive 'tis, said—</L>
<L>I have seen him bid high for a porphyry head.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis hard, fortune still should torment him with crosses;</L>
<L>I sooth'd him to bear the severest of losses:</L>
<L>I was with him, when blasted in youth's blooming charm▪</L>
<L>His lovely Sophia was torn from his arms.</L>
<L>You knew not, I think, that unfortunate fair,</L>
<L>The victim of cruelty, love, and despair.</L>
<L>She was bound to our friend by a mutual affection,</L>
<L>But her rich sordid parents oppos'd the connection.</L>
<L>The canker of sorrow incessantly prey'd</L>
<L>On the perishing bloom of the delicate maid:</L>
<L>Her duty, her suff'rings, made nature relent,</L>
<L>And wrung from her father a tardy consent;</L>
<L>But death render'd vain the late sanction he gave,</L>
<L>And his child's bridal bed was the pitiless grave.</L>
<L>Many years have now soften'd the lover's wild grief:</L>
<L>Perhaps some new beauty now yields him relief.</L>
<L>He's still single, I think?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! in learning and art</L>
<L>He has sought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart;</L>
<L>Hence a pleasing mild elegance runs thro' his life;</L>
<L>And had I a sister I'd wish her his wife.—</L>
<L>But now for your second friend!—What is his name?</L>
<L>For acquaintance with him too I'll certainly claim.</L>
<L>You say that I know him: come! tell me who is it!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes! indeed, it is one whom you frequently visit.</L>
<L>And here you must own, that my hopes are well founded,</L>
<L>Since in kindness and wealth he has ever abounded;</L>
<L>And a legacy lately—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You don't mean Bijou,</L>
<L>That collector of knick-knacks?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, Tom, I do.</L>
<L>I've a title to ask any favor from him:</L>
<L>He has some little vanity, some little whim,</L>
<L>Yet still he's a friendly, benevolent man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You may rap at his door—but get in if you can!</L>
<L>Your friend, when you saw him, was jocund and free,</L>
<L>His heart full of bounty, his spirit of glee;</L>
<L>His vanities too had so mirthful a cast,</L>
<L>That Friendship herself even wish'd them to last.</L>
<L>But Marriage, that changer of mind and of feature,</L>
<L>Has made poor Bijou quite a different creature.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am told that his wife, with a pocket well laden,</L>
<L>Was a little, fat, ancient, and well-behav'd maiden;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>Who, having a similar taste for virtù,</L>
<L>Put her cabinet under the care of Bijou.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, indeed! in an odd fit of amorous hunger,</L>
<L>He married an old curiosity-monger,</L>
<L>Who is ready to faint, if a visitor knocks</L>
<L>While she's brushing the dust from her raree-shew box.</L>
<L>Her maid t'other day threw her into a swoon,</L>
<L>By cracking the eye of a great stuff'd baboon;</L>
<L>For instead of young children, whose troublesome noise</L>
<L>Might disturb their sedate, <HI>virtuosical</HI> joys,</L>
<L>She fills their fine house with new monsters or mummies.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of your story, dear Tom, I perceive what the sum is.</L>
<L>You don't like the lady:—she may not please you,</L>
<L>And yet be an excellent wife for Bijou.</L>
<L>I am told she has really much merit and taste.</L>
<L>In her morals they say she's remarkably chaste;</L>
<L>So with lectures, perhaps, she has wounded your ear,</L>
<L>And you rakes of the Temple may think her severe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, faith! with the lady I stand very well,</L>
<L>I bought her esteem with an old empty shell.</L>
<L>I own she has piety, morals, and sense:</L>
<L>To chastity no one will doubt her pretence.</L>
<L>But tho' with these virtues I freely invest her,</L>
<L>My heart, I confess, is inclin'd to detest her.</L>
<L>She has ruin'd her husband—at least so I think;</L>
<L>To a dwarf she has made his benevolence shrink,</L>
<L>And puff'd up his vanity into a giant.</L>
<L>To all her strange whims he's so servilely pliant,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>He'd obey her caprice, whatsoe'er it might hint,</L>
<L>And deny himself bread to buy her an odd flint.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, Tom, that's a proof of his fond tender heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>To me it proves nought but her ladyship's art:</L>
<L>And so you yourself would explain the whole riddle,</L>
<L>If you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle,</L>
<L>As a more wretched brush never blotted poor paper,</L>
<L>And ne'er squeak'd a Cremona beneath a worse scraper.</L>
<L>Tho' pamper'd with flattery thus by his wife,</L>
<L>Our friend has quite lost all his humor and life;</L>
<L>And whenever I look on his cold chearless face,</L>
<L>As he stands by the side of his wife's fossil-case,</L>
<L>I think her a perfect Medusa, I own,</L>
<L>Who has turn'd her poor husband himself into stone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>You loungers, dear Tom, in your idle disputes,</L>
<L>Love to ridicule all life's amusing pursuits:</L>
<L>But they all have their use; and the lady who joys</L>
<L>In collecting an odd set of whimsical toys,</L>
<L>Is herself a rare gem, that my judgment regards,</L>
<L>More than all the fair votaries of scandal and cards.</L>
<L>I know I shall like her, in spite of your stricture,</L>
<L>And I'm going to see how you've fail'd in her picture.</L>
<L>My old friend's good-will I shall put to the trial,</L>
<L>And solicit his aid without fear of denial.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Come along!—I will see if your welcome is hearty;</L>
<L>Indeed I may serve you by joining the party,</L>
<L>And I'm eager to know (for my portrait is true)</L>
<L>What you think of the change she has wrought in Bijou.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>To a knowledge of nature I ne'er will pretend,</L>
<L>If, when you have seen, in the house of our friend,</L>
<L>All the natural rarities rang'd in a glass,</L>
<L>You don't rank his heart in the petrified class.

<STAGE>with a Brush.</STAGE>
<L>Lackaday! would I once were well out of this house,</L>
<L>Where I tremble to move, full as much as a mouse!</L>
<L>And Nanny's afraid to come into this room;</L>
<L>Indeed the poor creature can scarce hold a broom,</L>
<L>For my mistress, she says, has done nothing but bait her,</L>
<L>Since she brush'd off the tail of the new alligator.</L>
<L>I've a great mind to lay up my brush on the shelf,</L>
<L>And leave madam to dust all her monsters herself,</L>
<L>Would my master would make her, for these stocks and stones,</L>
<L>A young little plaything of good flesh and bones!</L>
<L>But, alas! these old ladies who can't raise a baby,</L>
<L>Are as full of nonsensical maggots as may be.</L>
<L>And our house is so cramm'd with this whimsical jumble,</L>
<L>That if you touch one thing, another will tumble,</L>
<L>Madam says, I misplace whatsoever I clean,</L>
<L>But I'll venture to wipe off the dust from this screen.</L>
<STAGE>Throws it down▪</STAGE>
<L>A plague take the things! they do nothing but fall.</L>
<L>Lud! my fingers have run thro' the cover and all.</L>
<STAGE>Taking up the Screen, and uncovering it.</STAGE>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>'Tis my master's new drawing—how madam will thunder—</L>
<L>This fine naked beauty I've torn quite asunder:</L>

<L>What's the matter, my dear?—What new plague from your maids?</L>
<L>You for ever are vext by these pestilent jades:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="12"/>If bred in this town, you object to their morals;</L>
<L>If rusties, they break all your glasses or corals.</L>
<L>Let 'em come whence they will, they bring trouble and strife,</L>
<L>And your quarrels have made me half sick of my life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Don't say so!—You know, my dear Mr. Bijou,</L>
<L>I take no young maids, out of fondness to you;</L>
<L>And these middle-ag'd creatures are all so unhandy,</L>
<L>They make me as fretful as old Mr. Shandy.</L>
<L>But, my dear, if you see me sometimes in a flame,</L>
<L>I think you won't say that my temper's to blame:</L>
<L>'Twas my love for the works of your delicate hand,</L>
<L>Which produc'd an emotion I could not command.</L>
<L>If I rated old Joan in a great agitation,</L>
<L>I am sure you will own I had much provocation,</L>
<L>When you see this sad cause of the bustle between us:</L>
<L>She has utterly ruin'd your very best Venus,</L>
<L>This new lovely drawing! the joy of all eyes!</L>
<L>I vow I could cry.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>What sweet softness!—she cries!—</L>
<L>These feelings, indeed, prove the true connoisseur:</L>
<L>This ill treatment of Art her fine sense can't endure.</L>
<L>Henceforth, of my works let them say what they will,</L>
<L>No painter can boast such a test of his skill.—</L>
<L>Come, chear up, my dear Cognoscente! come! come!</L>
<L>I can mend it again with a brush-full of gum.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>D'ye think you can mend it?—and won't it look brown,</L>
<L>If you don't hide the skin with the skirt of a gown?</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="13"/>'Twould be pity to cloak up a body so fine,</L>
<L>Especially since you have drawn it from mine.</L>
<L>And you know I caught cold, when I stript to the waist,</L>
<L>To fit for the figure, in true attic taste:</L>
<L>But I did it from fondness, that you might not roam,</L>
<L>And wickedly hunt after models from home.</L>
<L>To be sure I love art—but all artists, they say,</L>
<L>By their studies of nature are tempted to stray;</L>
<L>And I own that your genius gives me great alarms.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dear, tender creature! pray trust your own charms!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Affectionate terrors will rise in my head.</L>
<L>I was jealous, I own, t'other day, of the dead.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>What fond sensibility! exquisite feeling!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hope I was wrong, but strange fancies will steal in,</L>
<L>When fondness has open'd the heart to suspicion.</L>
<L>You're so dear to the females of every condition:</L>
<L>But, I hope, Lady Fancybird was not so vicious;</L>
<L>There was nothing, indeed, in her air meretricous;</L>
<L>Yet a jealous pang seiz'd me, I own, when I found</L>
<L>That by will she bequeath'd to you three thousand pound.</L>
<L>'Tis true, that a legacy's very commodious;</L>
<L>Yet the money appears to me utterly odious,</L>
<L>When I think it was possibly meant as the price</L>
<L>Of endearments, to which she had art to entice,</L>
<L>And not in return for the pictures you drew,</L>
<L>Of her parrot, her bull-finch, and old cockatoo.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Lord! my dear, if such phantoms your quiet consume,</L>
<L>You will make the old lady jump out of her tomb.</L>
<L>'Tis true, that I flatter'd her favourite passion,</L>
<L>As I love to be well with old ladies of fashion:</L>
<L>But pray don't suppose, I was e'er so absurd</L>
<L>As to stroke her pale cheek for the pole of her bird.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! you humorous man, you've such infinite wit,</L>
<L>You can turn to a jest whatsoe'er you think fit!—</L>
<L>But my heart on this point can be never at ease,</L>
<L>Unless you'll allow me to spend, as I please,</L>
<L>Half the money, of which you're so oddly possest;</L>
<L>Aud then I shall think it an honest bequest.</L>
<L>Besides, there's an auction at Lady Toy-Truckle's,</L>

<L>'Tis five years since his notes in this town have been heard.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mr. Cycle! my worthy, old friend! how d'ye do? —</L>
<L>Give me leave to present to you Mrs. Bijou!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm asham'd to be found in this garb.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! my dear,</L>
<L>From a man of true science you've nothing to fear;</L>
<L>He'll freely allow, for he's candid and just,</L>
<L>Philosophical ladies must dabble in dust.—</L>
<L>Mr. Cycle, my wife is a curious collector:</L>
<L>In natural knowledge I hope you'll direct her;</L>
<L>You are master of all, from the earth to the stars,</L>
<L>And may aid her in ranging her fossils and spars.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>She shall freely command all the little I know.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>You're extremely obliging, dear Sir, to say so</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="16"/>But I cannot attend you in this dusty vest.</L>
<L>I'll soon slip it off.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You shan't stir, I protest.</L>
<L>To talk of your dress, my dear Ma'am, is a joke,</L>
<L>To a sage, who exists but in chemical smoke.</L>
<L>Your robe is indeed like the robe of Saint Bruno,</L>
<L>Yet still by your air we might take you for Juno;</L>
<L>While the tail of your peacock, that type of command,</L>
<L>With such dignity waves in your awful white hand.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>You're a young saucy creature!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>These idle rogues, Madam,</L>
<L>More like sons of the Serpent, than children of Adam,</L>
<L>Are apt to esteem it a dull occupation,</L>
<L>To study the wonders of this fair creation:</L>
<L>And hence they all rally, with humour ill-plac'd,</L>
<L>Those who seek for amusement in science and taste.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well said! Mr. Cycle—I'm glad that Virtù</L>
<L>Has found both a friend and a champion in you.</L>
<L>Come and peep at my wife's philosophical treasure!</L>
<L>I hope you'll survey it again, at your leisure.—</L>
<L>My dear, d'ye allow me to shew your museum?—</L>
<L>I'm exact in all matters of <HI>tuum</HI> and <HI>meum.</HI></L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tell me, Tom, if you can,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="17"/>Is not this Mr. Cycle a man of great worth,</L>
<L>Who wrote a most excellent book on the Earth.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis the author himself; and I know not what college</L>
<L>Can shew his superior in virtue and knowledge.</L>
<L>He's a man of few words, with a heart and a mind</L>
<L>Ever busied in schemes for the good of mankind;</L>
<L>And he now visits London, in hopes to procure</L>
<L>Some support in a plan for relieving the poor.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>The poor!—of their name I'm alarm'd at the mention:</L>
<L>Mr. Cycle, indeed, may have no ill intention,</L>
<L>But I fear he'll involve my good husband in trouble—</L>
<L>These projects of charity end in a bubble.</L>
<L>The poor are ungrateful, disorderly wretches,</L>
<L>Who can shift for themselves by their tricks and their fetches;</L>
<L>They deserve not a learned philosopher's thought.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your pardon!—He'll think, if he thinks as he ought,</L>
<L>That Philosophy, drawing from Heaven her birth,</L>
<L>Is the science of soft'ning the evils on earth.</L>
<L>By your fears you have done our friend infinite wrong,</L>
<L>For tho' his heart's tender, his judgment is strong:</L>
<L>To the projects of Folly he never can stoop—</L>
<L>Philanthropy's friend is not Phantasy's dupe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, Careless! you talk in a language quite new:</L>
<L>Who could dream of a charity-sermon from you?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! a cobler can preach, when his spirit's inflam'd.</L>
<L>Mine is apt to blaze forth, if I hear a friend blam'd;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="18"/>And indeed I can't stifle my heart's ebullitions,</L>
<L>When such good folks as you harbour vile suppositions.</L>
<L>But I'm sure you'll forgive all the warmth I have shewn,</L>
<L>When the worth of our friend is to you better known.</L>
<L>If you're angry, I know that your anger will cease,</L>
<L>When you hear on what terms I can purchase my peace.</L>
<L>A shell I can bring you—my interest such is—</L>
<L>Very like what you lately gave up to the Duchess.</L>
<L>Perhaps I may give it you—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>You're a good soul—</L>
<L>As large as her Grace's, and perfectly whole?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, I think 'tis as large, and in colour as high.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Are you sure of its shape?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Do you question my eye?</L>
<L>I'll convince you I'm right; let us instantly look</L>
<L>At the fine colour'd plates in your great Danish book.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>

<L>This scheme, my good friend, does you honor indeed.</L>
<L>In a business so noble I hope you'll proceed;</L>
<L>And may you accomplish your utmost desires,</L>
<L>In raising the sum which your project requires!—</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="19"/>Pray look at this new little drawing of mine!</L>
<L>Don't you think it an elegant pretty design?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Very lively indeed!—But, my friend, you forget</L>
<L>What I've said on the point of incurring this debt.</L>
<L>Do not fly from the subject!—I hate all evasion:</L>
<L>I must say for your aid I have serious occasion.</L>
<L>You know what I've ask'd, and in asking I deem</L>
<L>That I give you a proof of my cordial esteem.</L>
<L>In a poor-house myself I would rather work hard,</L>
<L>Than apply thus to one whom I did not regard.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mr. Cycle, I know you're a man without guile,</L>
<L>And you think in a noble and singular style;</L>
<L>But if asking for cash is of love a sure test,</L>
<L>With affectionate friends all the wealthy are blest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have done, as I see that you wish to evade</L>
<L>A request, that I thought I with justice had made;</L>
<L>As you know, when of fortune you felt a reverse,</L>
<L>You had once the command of my prosperous purse;</L>
<L>And since you of opulence now are possest,</L>
<L>More enrich'd too of late by a friendly bequest,</L>
<L>I suppos'd, without trouble—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Cycle, 'tis true:</L>
<L>You shall have it; but mum! towards Mrs. Bijou!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! I now understand all the cause of demur;</L>
<L>And if that is the case, I have done, my dear Sir.</L>
<L>At the hazard of discord the sum you shan't lend;</L>
<L>In family strife I'll not plunge my old friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Do not think me a slave!—there's no danger of strife.</L>
<L>But you'll find, if you e'er try the conjugal life,</L>
<L>It is best not to waken the frowns of a wife.</L>
<L>Besides, there is surely no reason why you</L>
<L>Should talk on such business to Mrs. Bijou.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>There is certainly none—you shall do as you please.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>One thousand, my friend, I can spare you with ease;</L>
<L>'Tis the sum I shall go to receive very soon;</L>
<L>If you'll call here again, you shall have it by noon.</L>
<L>And to tell you the truth, I would have you make haste,</L>
<L>Lest my wife should demand it for matters of taste.</L>
<L>When an auction is near, she is apt to be rash,</L>
<L>In laying her hand upon all my loose cash;</L>

<L>As the key's in the case, he perhaps might unlock it,</L>

<L>How I long in thy features to mark the effect</L>

<L>There is only this statue, that's now in our sight,</L>

<L>Tom and Harriot have long had flirtations together,</L>

<L>Unless he bids fair to become a chief justice;</L>

<L>You forget, my dear Sir, how you often complain</L>

<L>My dearest, you'll not let the picture depart,</L>
<L>When you see it has taken such hold on my heart!—</L>
<L>I really can't rest, till a Titian we've got,</L>
<L>That <HI>we</HI> may have something Lord Seewell has <HI>not.</HI></L>
<L>And as we expect him, you know, here to-night,</L>
<L>I would shew him this piece with triumphant delight.</L>

<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay! Bijou! I am clear</L>
<L>You have now all I want in your pocket.—Come! come!</L>
<L>I know you went out to receive a large sum;</L>

<L>I'll take just enough, and restore you the rest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I can't suffer this freedom, my dear, I protest;</L>
<L>For the notes are not mine, they belong to a friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>To a friend!—O! I guess, Sir, to whom you would lend.</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="43"/>Your sly-looking guest, Mr. Cycle's the man;</L>
<L>I know he was here on a borrowing plan.</L>
<L>Throw your thousand away on a charity bubble!</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay! my dear, be not vex'd!—you have misunderstood:</L>
<L>The sum will be safe, and the interest good.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what is the pitiful profit you'll raise,</L>
<L>Compar'd to the transport with which we should gaze</L>
<L>On the picture my fondness would have you possess,</L>
<L>For reasons the purest that wife can profess?</L>
<L>Unkind as you are!—I have reasons above</L>
<L>Even profit and pleasure—the reasons of love.</L>
<L>'Tis my aim, by this modest production of art,</L>
<L>To strengthen your virtue and chasten your heart.</L>
<L>If you daily survey an example so bright,</L>
<L>This model of continence ever in sight,</L>
<L>No naughty young women will tempt you to wander,</L>
<L>But your truth and your love will grow firmer and fonder.</L>

<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>But if for a poor and a foolish projector,</L>
<L>You can thwart a fond wife, and afflict and neglect her—</L>
<L>Go! go! I shall weep, while abroad you may roam,</L>
<L>That your charity has no beginning at home.</L>

<L>Such virtuous endearments what heart could resist?</L>

<L>And what shall I say for the failure?—In sooth,</L>
<L>I think 'twill be fairest to tell him the truth:</L>
<L>And, sage as he is, he perhaps too has felt</L>
<L>That Gold, at the breath of a woman, will melt.—</L>

<L>Mr. Cycle, you're come, and I'm really confus'd;</L>

<L>In notes I had got you the thousand complete,</L>
<L>They were all in this pocket—</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>The thieves of the street</L>
<L>Have not pick'd it, I hope, in the bustle of strife?</L>
</SP>

<L>It was pick'd, I confess, by the hand of my wife;</L>

<L>I am happy the sum is so justly bestow'd.</L>

<L>Dear Bijou! let me save you at once from that pain;</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="45"/>And assure you, with truth, that I now really come</L>

<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I protest, I am glad you have found such a friend;</L>

<L>Your worthy friend Beril to-night we shall see;</L>
<L>And Seewell, in gusto the first of our Earls,</L>
<L>Will be here with his daughters, two delicate girls!</L>
<L>To prove, my good friend, your forgiveness is hearty,</L>

<L>Well!—I am griev'd, I must say,</L>

<L>My wife is preparing to shew her fine sights,</L>

<STAGE>Lord Seewell <HI>and</HI> Lady Harriot.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>DEAR Papa, don't betray me!—Her delicate mind</L>
<L>Would be wounded, I know, and would think me unkind;</L>
<L>So far from allowing, what now I impart,</L>
<L>She herself little knows the true state of her heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Believe me, my dear, I with pleasure survey</L>
<L>The sisterly fondness you warmly display.</L>
<L>But you, who for others so sensibly feel,</L>
<L>May here be the dupe of affectionate zeal;</L>
<L>And I hope you're mistaken.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dear Sir, observe!</L>
<L>You may trace her attachment in every nerve:</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="47"/>If I name Mr. Beril in some idle tale,</L>
<L>Poor Fanny will blush, and as often turn pale.</L>
<L>In his absence still more and more pensive she grows,</L>
<L>Yet thinks not from whence her uneasiness flows.</L>
<L>And when he returns, tho' her pleasure is meek,</L>
<L>Yet the glow of content may be seen on her cheek;</L>
<L>And her heart, as if fully consol'd by his sight,</L>
<L>Appears to repose in a tranquil delight.</L>
<L>Dear Papa, you'll perceive, if you'll open your eyes,</L>
<L>That from none but herself she her love can disguise.</L>
<L>One other exception perhaps we may find,</L>
<L>As I think Mr. Beril is equally blind,</L>
<L>And robb'd, like herself, of the talent of seeing,</L>
<L>By that diffident love, which denies it own being.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hope this attachment, which neither has shewn,</L>
<L>Exists, my good girl, in your fancy alone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why so, my dear Sir?—Should it prove, as you fear,</L>
<L>I hope, dear Papa, that you won't be severe.</L>
<L>Consider the delicate frame of my sister!</L>
<L>But I know you've a heart that can never resist her,</L>
<L>If you once clearly see she has fixt her affection,</L>
<L>Tho' she own not her wishes for such a connection;</L>
<L>As you know that her nature's so modest and meek,</L>
<L>She would die from concealment before she would speak.</L>
<L>I have strength to encounter the crosses of life,</L>
<L>And to make my part good, as a daughter or wife:</L>
<L>But our gentle sweet Frances is ill-form'd to bear</L>
<L>The undeserv'd load of vexation and care;</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="48"/>And therefore should wed, unregardful of pelf,</L>
<L>A husband as tender and mild as herself.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your reasoning, I think, is not perfectly just.</L>
<L>In the kindness of Beril perhaps I might trust;</L>
<L>But the motive you urge for this union, my dear,</L>
<L>Is what, I confess, would awaken my fear.</L>
<L>As you say, your mild sister should never be harrass'd</L>
<L>By those various ills with which life is embarrass'd,</L>
<L>I should guard her from all the vexations that wait</L>
<L>On a liberal mind with a narrow estate:</L>
<L>And if Beril had thoughts of becoming my son,</L>
<L>Had I <HI>not</HI> more objections, yet this must be one.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll remove it, my Lord, for indeed this is all:</L>
<L>As you think they'll be pinch'd by an income too small,</L>
<L>You shall add to their fortune, and large it will be,</L>
<L>Two thirds of the portion you've destin'd for me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Harriot! I'm charm'd with thy soul, I confess;</L>
<L>Thou'rt a generous girl—to a noble excess.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>To that name, dear Papa, I've no title, indeed,</L>
<L>As I only give up what I never can need.</L>
<L>In your house all my wants will, I know, be supply'd;</L>
<L>And if I should leave it, as Careless's bride,</L>
<L>The liberal heir of so large an estate</L>
<L>Will not grieve that my fortune has sunk in its weight.</L>
<L>Or should my swain frown at the change in my purse,</L>
<L>He may e'en take old Themis for better for worse;</L>
<L>For tho', I confess, he has won my regard,</L>
<L>Yet the knot of my love is not twisted so hard,</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="49"/>But 'twill slip in a moment, if ever I see</L>
<L>That he's rather more fond of my purse than of me,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis a pity, the friendly illusions of youth</L>
<L>Cannot instantly turn into substance and truth.</L>
<L>Your affectionate fancy, my dear, is delighted</L>
<L>With the dream of beholding two persons united,</L>
<L>Whom you fondly suppose only form'd for each other.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>I should like Mr. Beril, I own, for my brother,</L>
<L>Because I'm convinc'd, that no mortal on earth,</L>
<L>In manners, in temper, in taste, and in worth,</L>
<L>Is form'd so exactly to suit such a wife.</L>
<L>On their lasting attachment I'd venture my life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your warm heart, my good girl, your young judgment deceives,</L>
<L>And what the first wishes the second believes.</L>
<L>Dear Harriot, to <HI>this</HI> fancied match there may be</L>
<L>Many bars, which your eyes are unable to see:</L>
<L>A mistress conceal'd with a young little fry—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Should an angel declare it, the fact I'd deny;</L>
<L>For had Beril been loaded with such a connection,</L>
<L>In his eyes I had never perceiv'd his affection.</L>
<L>But I'll presently solve any doubts of this kind,</L>
<L>As I'm soon to be told the true state of his mind;</L>
<L>For Careless has promis'd—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>O fie! my dear, fie!</L>
<L>Your intemperate zeal has now risen too high.</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="50"/>I am really concern'd at your great indiscretion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay! but hear me, my Lord!—I have dropt no expression,</L>
<L>No! not one single hint, that could truly discover</L>

<L>No!—with terrors too lively your bosom is fill'd.</L>
<L>My dear, how you tremble!—But I was to blame,</L>
<L>To raise this alarm in your delicate frame.</L>
<L>He is well; but some crosses of fortune, I fear,</L>
<L>Make him fell what he justly consider'd so dear.</L>
<L>You will see by this letter.—

<L>The excess of her fear from affection must flow!</L>

<L>How painful to him must the exigence be,</L>
<L>Which extorts from his hand the agreement I see!</L>
<L>How cruel! for him to relinquish a treasure,</L>
<L>Whence his elegant spirit deriv'd so much pleasure!</L>
<L>But I trust, dear Papa, that your generous mind</L>
<L>Will not now press the bargain he once has declin'd;</L>

<L>Will not catch at the gem he still ought to possess.</L>

<L>That you may not suffer from follies like these,</L>
<L>I have just now consign'd to the care of trustees</L>

<L>O, my dear, such a blow!</L>
<L>I really had swoon'd, if vexation and wrath</L>
<L>Had not quicken'd my spirits, to scold at the Goth.</L>
<L>That awkward old Joan!—an unmannerly minx!</L>
<L>Has knock'd off the nipple, my dear, from a Sphinx;</L>
<L>And now on our chimney it cannot be plac'd,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dear, the exchange is most lucky and right,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I protest he has got the true turn of your nose;</L>
<L>Not the aquiline curve, but a little Socratic:</L>
<L>And his eye flashes fire, that is chastly ecstatic.—</L>
<L>There's a rap at our door! and I hope my Lord's come.</L>
<L>If vexation and envy do not strike him dumb,</L>
<L>I think he'll harangue, like a critic of Greece,</L>
<L>On the exquisite charms of this beautiful piece!</L>
<L>I long to behold how he's touch'd by the sight:</L>
<L>But I know that his envy will sink his delight.</L>
<L>The moment he sees it, he'll think his luck cruel,</L>
<L>In missing so precious a cabinet jewel.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Mr. Beril <HI>and</HI> Mr. Cycle.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Cycle, I take this exceedingly kind;</L>
<L>And I hope you've not left your Cremona behind.</L>
<L>In your presence to-night I most truly rejoice,</L>
<L>And shall call for the aid of your hand and your voice,</L>
<L>(As my wife gives a snug little concert below)</L>
<L>When you've seen what her upper apartments can shew.</L>

<SPEAKER>MR. CYCLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>You may freely command me, my friend, as you please.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>You're a judge, Mr. Beril, of treasures like these;</L>
<L>And I'm eager to shew you a Titian, that's new</L>
<L>Since we last had the joy of a visit from you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BERIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>The story is told, Ma'am, with striking expression.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Don't you envy my husband this brilliant possession?</L>
<L>I thought you'd burst forth into rapturous praise;</L>
<L>But with no keen delight on this picture you gaze!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BERIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>To confess, Ma'am, the truth, I'm a whimsical being,</L>
<L>And a subject like this I've no pleasure in seeing.</L>
<L>On <HI>your</HI> lovely sex 'tis a satire most bitter,</L>
<L>That ill-nature may laugh at, and levity titter:</L>
<L>But I'm griev'd, when an artist has lavish'd his care</L>
<L>On a story that seems a disgrace to the Fair.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our sex's chief lustre, I own, it obscures:</L>
<L>But think what a lesson it offers to yours!</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lady Harriot, Lady Frances, Lord Seewell, <HI>and</HI> Mr. Careless.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dear Lord, I this instant was wishing for you.</L>
<L>Your voice is decisive in points of Virtù;</L>
<L>And you're come in the moment to end an odd strife,</L>
<L>In a matter of taste about Potiphar's wife.—</L>
<L>Should her story be painted?—We want your decision;</L>
<L>And here is the picture that caus'd our division.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! my poor old acquaintance!—But how, dear Bijou,</L>
<L>How the deuce could this picture find favor with you?</L>
<L>I hope that rogue Varnish has play'd you no trick.—</L>
<L>You have paid no great price—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am cut to the quick!</L>
<L>Sure, my Lord, you ne'er look'd on this picture before?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Madam! 'tis one that I turn'd out of door;</L>
<L>And, as I may aid you to 'scape from a fraud,</L>
<L>I'll proceed to inform you, I bought it abroad,</L>
<L>To relieve the distress of an indigent youth,</L>
<L>Who copied old Masters with spirit and truth;</L>
<L>And when it came home, as I valu'd it not,</L>
<L>My steward, by chance, this gay furniture got.</L>
<L>To a new house of his it has lately been carried;</L>
<L>And as your friend Varnish his daughter has married,</L>
<L>I suppose the sly rogue by this picture has try'd,</L>
<L>To increase the small fortune he gain'd with his bride.</L>
<L>Search the garment of Joseph! you'll find on its hem,</L>
<L>And within a dark fold, the two letters T. M.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye! there is the mark! —we are cheated, we're plunder'd.</L>
<L>That infamous villain, to ask me eight hundred!—</L>
<L>But the law shall restore it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>See! Mrs. Bijou,</L>
<L>See the fruits of my hasty indulgence to you!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Chear up, my old friend!—'Tis my wish, that this night</L>
<L>May be witness to nothing but peace and delight.</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="58"/>I'll engage to make Varnish your money restore;</L>
<L>And perhaps this adventure may save you much more.</L>
<L>All we old connoisseurs, if the truth we would own,</L>
<L>Have, at times, been outwitted with canvas or stone:</L>
<L>But here's one, whose example our tribe now invites</L>
<L>To correct our mistakes, and improve our delights.</L>
<L>Here's Beril, tho' blest with a treasure most rare,</L>
<L>That with few works of art will admit of compare,</L>
<L>Gives up the proud joys, that on such wealth attend,</L>
<L>For the nobler delight of assisting a friend!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BERIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord! you amaze me; how could you divine?—</L>
<L>O, Careless! your zeal has betray'd my design.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>You have fixt on the traitor, yet are not aware,</L>
<L>That you're almost involv'd in a dangerous snare:</L>
<L>But I'll shew you this traitor's accomplice, my friend,</L>
<L>And tell you what mischief these plotters intend.</L>
<L>You must know, Tom and Harriot in concert pursue</L>
<L>Their dark machinations 'gainst Frances and you:</L>
<L>They have sworn you've a tender esteem for each other,</L>
<L>Which you both have in modesty labour'd to smother.</L>
<L>If their charge can be prov'd, I your freedom restrain,</L>
<L>And sentence you both to the conjugal chain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BERIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, my Lord! that I love Lady Frances, is true;</L>
<L>Yet I could not avow it to her, or to you:</L>
<L>But to force my confession, such means you employ,</L>
<L>I almost may call them the torture of joy.</L>
<L>I'm o'erwhelm'd with surprize, with delight, and with dread,</L>
<L>Lest I falsely have heard the kind things you have said.</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="59"/>Speak! my dear Lady Frances, my anguish relieve!</L>
<L>Does this tumult of hope my wild fancy deceive?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY FRANCES.</SPEAKER>
<L>I so long have my father's indulgence confest,</L>
<L>That against his decrees I shall never protest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BERIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, how shall I thank thee, dear pride of my life!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>By cherishing still in the mind of your wife,</L>
<L>Such generous feelings as <HI>you</HI> have display'd.—</L>
<L>From my hand, my dear Beril, receive the kind maid!</L>
<L>Your statue is not more indebted to art,</L>
<L>Than she is to nature for moulding her heart.</L>
<L>They both shall be yours; both the statue and bride!</L>
<L>And the wants of your friend shall no less be supply'd.—</L>
<L>Being free from one modish and wealth—wasting vice,</L>
<L>From those pests of our order, the turf and the dice,</L>
<L>I enjoy, my dear children, the fortunate power,</L>
<L>Of securing your bliss by an affluent dower.</L>
<L>Your quiet shall ne'er by your income be hurt,</L>
<L>Which shall equal your wish, tho' below your desert.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BERIL.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of your kindness, my Lord, I so feel the excess,</L>
<L>That my voice cannot speak what my heart would express.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am charm'd, my dear Lord, by your choice of a son.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD SEEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know, my old friend, you'll approve what I've done.</L>
<L>You and I, dear Bijou, wanting proper correction,</L>
<L>Have on vanity lavished the dues of affection.</L>
<L>We have both squander'd cash on too many a whim;</L>
<L>But in taste let us take a new lesson from him!</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="60"/>And rate our improvements in real Virtù,</L>
<L>By the generous acts he may teach us to do;</L>
<L>To remember this truth is the connoisseur's duty;</L>
<L>"A benevolent deed is the essence of beauty."</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. BIJOU.</SPEAKER>
<L>I confess, I too oft have been vanity's fool;</L>
<L>But shall hope to grow wise, my good Lord, in your school,</L>
<L>And, as mirth should be coupled with wisdom, I'll go</L>
<L>And see if the fiddles are ready below.

<L>I confess, I am charm'd with his spirit and heart.</L>

<L>For sealing, dear Tom, you may fix your own day,</L>

<L>May we all think this day the best day of our life!</L>
<L>It will prove so, I'm sure, both to me and my wife.</L>
