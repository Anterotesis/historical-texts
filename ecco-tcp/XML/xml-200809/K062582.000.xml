<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Character OF THE Old <HI>BATCHELOR.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See,</HI> The TATLER, N<SUP>o</SUP> 9.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>IN the Character which gives Name to this Play, there is excellently re∣presented the Reluctance of a battered Debaucheé to come into the Trammels of Order and Decency: He neither languishes, nor burns, but frets for Love. The Gentlemen of more regular Behaviour, are drawn with much Spirit and Wit; and the <HI>Drama</HI> introduced by the Dialogue of the first Scene, with uncommon, yet natural Conversation. The Part of <HI>Fondlewife</HI> is a lively Image of the unseasonable Fondness of Age and Impotence.</P>

<HEAD>Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>'s CHARACTER OF THE Mourning Bride.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See,</HI> His <HI>Preface</HI> to <HI>Prince</HI> ARTHUR, Fol. 1697.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Poem</HI> has received, and in my Opinion, very justly, uni∣versal Applause; being look'd on as the most perfect <HI>Tragedy</HI> that has been wrote in this Age. The <HI>Fable,</HI> as far as I can judge at first Sight, is a very artful and masterly Contrivance; the <HI>Characters</HI> are well chosen and well
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
delineated; that of ZARA is admi∣rable. The <HI>Passions</HI> are well touch'd, and skilfully wrought up. The <HI>Diction,</HI> proper, clear, beautiful, noble, and di∣versified agreeably to the Variety of the Subject. <HI>Vice,</HI> as it ought to be, is punish'd; and <HI>oppressed-Innocence</HI> at last rewarded. <HI>Nature</HI> appears very hap∣pily imitated (excepting one or two doubtful Instances) thro' the whole Piece; in which there are no immodest Images or Expressions; no wild un∣natural Rants, but (some Exceptions being allowed) all Things are chaste, just, and decent.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tragedy,</HI> as I said before, has mightily obtained, and that without the unnatural and foolish Mixture of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Buffoonery;</HI> without so much as a <HI>Song,</HI> or a <HI>Dance,</HI> to make it
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
more agreeable. By this it appears, that as a sufficient Genius can recom∣mend itself, and furnish out abundant Matter of Pleasure and Admiration, without the paultry Helps above named; so likewise, that the Taste of the Nation is not so far deprav'd, but that a regular and chaste Play will not only be forgiven, but highly ap∣plauded.</P>

<P>CONGREVE of all the Mo∣derns, seems to me, to have the rightest Turn for <HI>Comedy.</HI> In all his Plays there is a great deal of <HI>lively</HI> and <HI>uncommon Humour,</HI> and such as yet, for the most Part, is a <HI>Picture</HI> of <HI>true Life.</HI> Besides, he hath raised the Vein of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> and made the STAGE, which had been too much prostituted to the Mob, <HI>edifying</HI> to Persons of the
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
first Condition. And as his <HI>Fable</HI> is <HI>Diverting,</HI> so is it wrought accord∣ing to the <HI>strictest Rules.</HI></P>
<P>The following EPISTLE, <HI>Of right∣ly improving the present Time,</HI> written to Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> is here printed from a Ma∣nuscript of the Author, with which I was obliged by a Person of the first Rank: The Public having been notoriously abused, by a very erroneous Copy, sur∣reptitiously obtained, by one LEWIS in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> and vended under the Cover of A.

<L>SINCEREST Critic of my Prose, or Rhime,</L>
<L>Tell how thy pleasing STOWE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Name of his Lordship's SEAT in <HI>Buckinghamshire.</HI></NOTE> employs thy Time.</L>
<L>Say, COBHAM, what amuses thy Retreat?</L>
<L>Or Stratagems of War, or Schemes of State?</L>
<L>Dost thou recal to Mind with Joy, or Grief,</L>
<L>Great <HI>MARLBRO</HI>'s Actions? That immortal <HI>Chief,</HI></L>
<L>Whose slightest Trophy rais'd in each Campaign,</L>
<L>More than suffic'd to signalize a Reign?</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Does thy Remembrance rising warm thy Heart,</L>
<L>With Glory past, where Thou thy self hadst Part,</L>
<L>Or dost thou grieve indignant, now to see,</L>
<L>The fruitless End of all thy Victory?</L>
<L>To see th' Audacious Foe, so late subdu'd,</L>
<L>Dispute those Terms for which so long they su'd,</L>
<L>As if BRITANNIA now were sunk so low,</L>
<L>To beg that PEACE she wonted to bestow,</L>
<L>Be far that Guilt! be never known that Shame!</L>
<L>That ENGLAND shou'd retract her <HI>rightful Claim,</HI></L>
<L>Or ceasing to be dreaded and ador'd,</L>
<L>Stain with her Pen the Lustre of her Sword.</L>
<L>Or dost thou give the Winds a-far to blow,</L>
<L>Each vexing-Thought, and Heart-devouring Woe,</L>
<L>And fix thy Mind alone on rural Scenes,</L>
<L>To turn the level'd Lawns to liquid Plains,</L>
<L>To raise the creeping Rills from humble Beds,</L>
<L>And force the latent Springs to lift their Heads,</L>
<L>On watry Columns, Capitals to rear,</L>
<L>That mix their flowing Curls with upper Air.</L>
<L>Or dost Thou, weary grown, these Works neglect,</L>
<L>No Temples, Statues, Obelisks erect,</L>
<L>But catch the morning Breeze from fragrant Meads,</L>
<L>Or shun the Noon-tide Ray in wholsom Shades,</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Or slowly walk, along the mazy Wood,</L>
<L>To meditate on all that's wise and good,</L>
<L>For Nature bountiful, in Thee has join'd,</L>
<L>A Person pleasing with a worthy Mind,</L>
<L>Not given the Form alone, but Means, and Art,</L>
<L>To draw the Eye, or to allure the Heart.</L>
<L>Poor were the Praise in Fortune to excel,</L>
<L>Yet want the Way to use that Fortune well.</L>
<L>While thus adorn'd, while thus with Virtue crown'd,</L>
<L>At Home, in Peace; Abroad, in Arms renown'd;</L>
<L>Graceful in Form, and winning in Address,</L>
<L>While well you think, what aptly you express,</L>
<L>With Health, with Honour, with a fair Estate,</L>
<L>A Table free, and elegantly neat.</L>
<L>What can be added more to mortal Bliss?</L>
<L>What can he want that stands possest of This?</L>
<L>What can the fondest wishing Mother more,</L>
<L>Of Heaven attentive for her Son implore?</L>
<L>And yet a <HI>Happiness</HI> remains <HI>unknown,</HI></L>
<L>Or to <HI>Philosophy</HI> reveal'd <HI>alone;</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Precept,</HI> which unpractis'd renders vain,</L>
<L>Thy flowing Hopes, and Pleasure turns to Pain.</L>
<L>Shou'd Hope, and Fear thy Heart alternate tear,</L>
<L>Or Love, or Hate, or Rage, or anxious Care,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Whatever Passions may thy Mind infest,</L>
<L>(Where is that Mind which Passions ne'er molest?)</L>
<L>Amidst the Pangs of such intestine Strife,</L>
<L>Still <HI>think the</HI> PRESENT DAY, <HI>the</HI> LAST <HI>of</HI> LIFE;</L>
<L>Defer not till to <HI>Morrow</HI> to be <HI>Wise,</HI></L>
<L>To <HI>Morrow's</HI> SUN, to <HI>Thee</HI> may never <HI>rise.</HI></L>
<L>Or shou'd to <HI>Morrow</HI> chance to cheer thy <HI>Sight,</HI></L>
<L>With her enliv'ning and unlookt-for <HI>Light,</HI></L>
<L>How grateful will appear her <HI>dawning Rays!</HI></L>
<L>As Favours <HI>unexpected</HI> doubly <HI>please.</HI></L>
<L>Who thus can think, and who such Thoughts pursues,</L>
<L>Content may keep his Life, or calmly lose;</L>
<L>All Proofs of this Thou may'st thy self receive,</L>
<L>When Leisure from Affairs will give thee Leave.</L>
<L>Come, see thy Friend, retir'd without Regret,</L>
<L>Forgetting Care, or striving to forget;</L>
<L>In easy Contemplation soothing Time</L>
<L>With Morals much, and now and then with Rhime,</L>
<L>Not so robust in Body, as in Mind,</L>
<L>And always undejected, tho' declin'd;</L>
<L>Not wond'ring at the World's new wicked Ways,</L>
<L>Compar'd with those of our Fore-fathers Days,</L>

For Virtue now is neither more or less,</L>

At <HI>first,</HI> they begin pretty courtly, at least in their Expressions, as, <HI>Madam, by your leave,</HI> or so; which the LADIES are so good as <HI>seldom to deny.</HI> Afterwards, it is shameful to describe the <HI>Tricks</HI> that are play'd by this <HI>lewd Pack.</HI> By <HI>an established</HI>

<HI>Rule,</HI> each <HI>Lady</HI> has the Choice of her <HI>Gallant</HI> in her <HI>Turn,</HI> and some have been known so unreasonable, af∣ter they have had <HI>Three,</HI> to call for a <HI>Fourth.</HI> Your Deponent has seen a <HI>Lady</HI> on her <HI>Back,</HI> a <HI>Man</HI> o'Top of <HI>her,</HI> and a <HI>Lady</HI> o'Top of <HI>him;</HI> and he avers, it has been known, that a <HI>Court Valet</HI> has <HI>stript them all.</HI> Sometimes they are thrown on their <HI>Backs,</HI> sometimes on their <HI>Bellies</HI> now higgledy piggledy, and anon, they are <HI>all</HI> o'Top of <HI>one another;</HI> and if <HI>any one</HI> is call'd upon, they are oblig'd <HI>to show</HI> ALL. Of the same Nature is their Discourse, your Deponent has often over-heard them talking of their <HI>A—es,</HI> with the same Familiarity as their <HI>Faces; I have a Black</HI> one, says one, and named the <HI>Thing</HI> directly; <HI>mine is better than yours,</HI> says the other,

and Names her <HI>Thing; must I be laught at,</HI> says a Third, <HI>because I have a red one.</HI> There is <HI>one monstrous Thing</HI> that your Deponent is almost ashamed to mention; after <HI>Six,</HI> a <HI>Lady</HI> has asked <HI>if they could do no more;</HI> nay, a certain <HI>Lady</HI> has been known to play all the <HI>Tricks over</HI> by <HI>her self.</HI> Your Deponent likewise avers, that he has full Proof, after the LADIES have been tired with their GALLANTS, they have called for <HI>fresh ones:</HI> In short the aforesaid LADIES, have not only, <HI>spent their Pin-Money, but their Husband's Estates,</HI> upon <HI>Hercules, Cupid, Pit,</HI> and the <HI>Gardiner,</HI> and when they want more Money, they commonly <HI>Pawn</HI> their <HI>Jewels,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
