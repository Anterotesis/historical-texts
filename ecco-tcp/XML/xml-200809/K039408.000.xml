<P>How is she now, Nanny, any better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Something, but very low spirited still, I verily believe it is as you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I would take my book oath of it.—I cannot be deceived in that point, Nanny—ay, ay; her business is done; she is certainly breeding, depend upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so the house-keeper thinks too.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay, I know the father! the very man that ruined her!</P>

<P>As sure as you are alive, Nanny, or I am greatly deceived, and yet I can't be deceived neither—Was not that the cook that came gallopping so hard over the common just now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same. How very hard he gallopped. He has been but three quarters of an hour, he says, coming from Hyde Park corner.</P>

<P>And, what time will the family be down?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has orders to have dinner ready by Five; there are to be Lawyers, and a great deal of company.—He fancies there is to be a private wedding here to night, between our young Master Charles, and Lord Lumbercourt's daughter—the Scotch Lady:—who, he says, is just come from Bath on purpose to be married to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, Lady Rodolpha, as they call her, nay, like enough: for I know it has been talked of a good while; well, go tell Miss Constantia that I will be with her immediately.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall, Mrs. Betty.

Well, John, ever a letter for me?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mrs. Betty, but here's one for Miss Constantia.</P>

<P>Give it me—hum—my Lady's hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And here is one which the postman says is for my young master, but it is a strange direction
<STAGE>(reads)</STAGE>
To Charles Egerton, Esq.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! yes—yes—that is for Master Charles, John, for he has drop! his fathers name of Mac Syco∣phant, and has taken up that of Egerton.—The Par∣liament has ordered it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Parliament! pry'thee why so, Mrs. Betty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, John, that my Lady, his mother, was an Egerton by her father; she stole a match with our old master, for which all her fa∣mily, on both sides, have hated Sir Pertinax, and the whole crew of the Mac Sycophants ever since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except Master Charles, Mrs. Betty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! they doat upon him, for tho' he be a Mac Sycophant, he's the pride of all my Lady's fa∣mily.—And so, John, my Lady's uncle, Sir Stanley Egerton, dying an old batchelor, and, as I said before, mortally hating our old master, and the whole crew of the Mac Sycophants, lest his whole estate to Master Charles, who was his God-son; but on condition tho', that he shou'd drop his fathers name of Mac Sycophant, and take up that of Egerton, and that is the reason, John, why the Parliament has made him change his name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad that Master Charles has got the estate however, for he is a sweet tempered gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>As ever lived, but come, John, as I know you love Miss Constantia, and are fond of an oppor∣tunity of speaking to her, I will make you happy, you shall carry her letter to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I, Mrs. Betty? I am very much ob∣liged to you, where is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the housekeeper's room, settling the de∣sert.—Give me Mr. Egerton's letter, I will lay it on the table in his dressing room, I see it's from his bro∣ther, Mr. Sandy; so, now go and deliver your letter to your sweetheart, John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I will, Mrs Betty, and I am much obliged to you for the savour of letting me carry it to her; for tho' she should never have me, yet I shall always love her, and wish to be near her, she is so sweet a creature—Your servant, Mrs. Betty, I will kiss the letter for her sake—sweet, sweet, dear Miss Constantia!—O! if I was but kissing her hand, Betty, now, instead of this letter, how happy shou'd I be—Your servant, Mrs. Betty.
<STAGE>Exit John.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, John—ha! ha! ha! poor fel∣low, he perfectly doats on her, and daily follows her
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
about with nosegays and fruit, and the first of every thing in the season; ay, and my young Master Charles too, he is in as bad a way as the gardiner—in short, every body loves her, and that is one reason why I hate her:—for my part, I wonder what the deuce the men see in her—a creature that was taken in for charity—I am sure she is not so handsome—I wish she was out of the family once, if she was, I might then stand a chance of being my Lady's favourite myself; ay, and perhaps of getting one of my young Masters for a sweetheart—or at least, the Chaplain—But as to him, there would be no such great catch, if I should get him—I will try for him however; and my first step shall be, to let the Doctor know all I have discovered about Constantia's intrigues with her spark at Hadley—Yes, that will do, for the Doctor loves to talk with me, and always smiles and jokes with me
<STAGE>(<HI>laughs</HI>)</STAGE>
he, he,—he loves to hear me talk too, and I verily believe he, he, he, that he has a sneaking kindness for me! besides, this story will make him have a good opinion of my honesty, and that I am sure will be one step to∣wards it.—O bless me! here he comes, and my young Master with him—I'll watch an opportunity to speak to him, as soon as he is alone, for I will blow her up, I am resolved, as great a favourite, and as cunning as she is.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Egerton (<HI>in great warmth and emotion</HI>) Sidney <HI>following, as in earnest conversation.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, dear Charles, but why are you so impe∣tuous? Why do you break from me so abruptly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done, Sir—You have refused—I have nothing more to say upon the subject—I am satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>Spoke with a glow of tender friendship.</HI>)</STAGE>
Come, come, correct this warmth; it is the only weak in∣gredient in your nature; and you ought to watch it carefully; if I am wrong, I will submit without re∣serve; but consider the nature of your request, and how it would affect me. From your earliest Youth
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
your Father has honoured me with the care of your Education, and the general conduct of your mind; and however singular and morose his behaviour may be towards others, to me he has ever been respectful and liberal. I am now under his roof too—and because I will not abet an unwarrantable passion, by an abuse of my sacred character, in marrying you beneath your rank, and in direct opposition to your Father's hopes and happiness—you blame—you angrily break from me, and call me unkind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>With kindness and conviction.</HI>)</STAGE>
Dear Sidney, for my warmth I stand condemned; but for my mar∣riage with Constantia, I think I can justify it upon every principle of filial duty, honour and worldly pru∣dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only make that appear, Charles, and you know you may command me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible how unworthy it appears in a Son to descant on the unamiable passions of a Father; but as we are alone, and friends, I cannot help ob∣serving, in my own defence, that when a Father will not allow the use of reason to any of his Family—when his pursuit of greatness makes him a slave abroad—only to be a tyrant at home—when his narrow partiality to Scotland, on every trivial occasion, pro∣vokes him to enmity even with his Wife and Children, only because they dare give a national preference where they think it is most justly due—and when merely to gratify his own ambition, he would marry his Son into a family he detests.
<STAGE>(<HI>With great warmth.</HI>)</STAGE>
Sure, Sidney, a Son thus circumstanced (from the dignity of human nature, and the feelings of a loving heart) has a right, not only to protest against the blindness of the Parent, but to pursue those measures, that virtue and happiness point out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>The violent temper of Sir Pertinax, I own, cannot on many occasions be defended—but still your intended alliance with Lord Lumbercourt.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! contemptible! A trifling, quaint, haughty, voluptuous! servile tool!—the mere lackey of party and corruption; who for the prostitution of near
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
thirty years, and the ruin of a noble fortune, has had the despicable satisfaction, and the infamous honour, of being kicked up, and kicked down, kicked in, and kicked out—just as the insolence, compassion, or con∣veniency of leaders predominated; and now, being forsaken by all parties, his whole political consequence amounts to, the power of franking a letter, and the right honourable priviledge of not paying a Tradesman's bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, dear Charles, you are not to wed my Lord, but his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is as disagreeable for a companion, as her Father is for a friend or an ally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! What, her Scotch accent, I suppose, offends you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—upon my honour—not in the least, I think it entertaining in her, but were it otherwise, in decency—and, indeed, in national affection (being a Scotchman myself) I can have no objection to her on that account—besides, she is my near relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I understand—but how comes Lady Rodol∣pha, who, I find, was born in England, to be bred in Scotland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the dotage of an old, formal, obsti∣nate, stiff, rich, Scotch Grandmother; who, upon a promise of leaving this Grandchild all her fortune, which is very considerable, wou'd have the Girl sent to her to Scotland, when she was but a year old; and there has she been bred up ever since, with this old Lady, in all the vanity, and unlimitted indulgence, that fondness and admiration could bestow on a spoiled Child, a fancied Beauty! and a pretended Wit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! you are too severe on her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think so, Sidney; for she seems a being expressly fashioned by nature, to figure in these days of levity and dissipation! her spirits are inex∣haustible! her parts strong and lively! with a sagacity that discerns, and a talent not unhappy in painting the weak side of whatever comes before her.—But what raises her merit to the highest pitch, in the laughing world is, her boundless vanity, in the exertion of those
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
talents, which often renders herself much more ridi∣culous, than the most whimsical of the characters she exposes.—And is this a woman fit to make my happi∣ness? This the partner that Sidney would recommend to me for life? To you, who best know me, I ap∣peal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Charles, it is a delicate point—unfit for me to determine—besides your Father has set his mind upon the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>Impatiently.</HI>)</STAGE>
All that I know—but still I ask, and insist upon your candid judgment, is she the kind of Woman that you think cou'd possibly contribute to my happiness?—I beg you will give me an explicit answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>The subject is disagreeable—But since I must speak—I do not think she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you do not; and I am sure you ne∣ver will advise the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never did—I never will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>With a start of joy.</HI>)</STAGE>
You make me happy—which, I assure you, I never could be with your judg∣ment against me on this point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Charles, give me leave to observe, that Lady Rodolpha, with all her ridiculous laughing vanity, has a goodness of heart, and a kind of viva∣city, that not only entertains, but upon seeing her two or three times, improves upon you, and when her tor∣rent of spirits abates, and she condescends to converse gravely, you will really like her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, aye, she is sprightly, good-humoured, and tho' whimsical, and often too high in her colouring of characters, and in the trifling business of the idle world, yet, I think she has principles and a good heart; but in a partner for life, Sidney, (you know your own precept—your own judgment) affection, capricious in its nature, must have something even in the external manners—nay, in the very mode, not only of beauty, but virtue itself, which both heart and judgment must approve, or our happiness in that delicate point cannot be lasting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that mode that amiable essential, I never can meet with but in Constantia.—You sigh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I only wish that Constantia had a fortune equal to yours; but pray, Charles, suppose I had been so indiscreet as to have agreed to marry you to Con∣stantia, would she have consented, think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I cannot say positively; but I sup∣pose so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you never speak to her, upon that subject then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>In general terms only; never directly asked her consent in form; but I will this very moment, for I have no asylum from my Father's arbitrary design, but my Constantia's arms—Pray do not stir from hence—I will return instantly; I know she will submit to your advice, and I am sure you will persuade her to my wish, as my life, my peace, my earthly happiness depend upon my Constantia.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Charles! He little dreams that I love Constantia—but to what degree I knew not myself, till he importuned me to join their hands.—Yes, I love, but must not be a rival—for he is dear to me as fraternal friendship—my benefactor, my friend, and that name is sacred It is our better self, and ought to be preferred.—For the man who gratifies his pas∣sions at the expence of his friend's happiness, wants but a head to contrive, for he has a heart capable of the blackest vice.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Betty, <HI>raming up to him.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon, Sir, for my intrusion; I hope, Sir, I do not disturb you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, Mrs Betty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly hope you will excuse me, Sir,—but I wanted to break my mind to your honour about a scruple—that lies upon my conscience—and, indeed, I shou'd not have presumed to trouble you, Sir, but that I know you are my young Master's friend—and, indeed, a friend to the whole family—

very low.)</HI></STAGE>
for to give you your due, Sir, you are as good a preacher as ever went into a pulpit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Do you think so, Mrs. Betty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay in truth do I—and as good a Gentleman too as ever came into a family, and one that never gives a servant a hard word; nor that does any one an ill turn, neither behind one's back, nor before one's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—why you are a mightty well spoken woman, Mrs. Betty, and I am extremely be∣holden to you for your good character of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, it is no more than what you de∣serve; and what all the servants say of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to them, Mrs. Betty—But pray, what are your commands with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I will tell you, Sir,—to be sure, I am but a servant, as a body may say, and every tub should stand upon its own bottom; but
<STAGE>(she holds him familiarly, looks about cautiously, and speaks in a low familiar tone of great secrecy.)</STAGE>
my young Master is now in the China room, in close conference with Miss Con∣stantia—I know what they are about—but that is no business of mine—and therefore I made bold to listen a little; because you know, Sir, one would be sure, be∣fore one took away any body's good name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Mrs. Betty—very true, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! heavens forbid that I should take away any young woman's good name, unless I had good reason for it:—But, Sir, if I am in this place alive—as I listened with my ear close to the door—I heard my young Master ask Miss Constantia—the plain mar∣riage question; upon which, I started and trembled—nay, my very conscience stirred within me so, that I, I, I cou'd not help peeping thro' the key-hole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—And so your conscience made you peep thro' the key-hole, Mrs. Betty?—Ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>It did indeed, Sir, and then I saw my young Master down upon his knees; and what do you think he was doing?—Lord bless us!—kissing her hand, as if he would eat it; and protesting and assuring her, he knew that you, Sir, would consent to the match—and
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
then, O! my good Sir, the tears ran down her cheeks as fast—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Crying tenderly.)</STAGE>
They did indeed, Sir; I wou'd not tell your reverence a lie for the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it, Mrs. Betty, I believe it; and what did Constantia say to all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Sneering severely, and shaking her head.)</STAGE>
O! she is fly enough—she looks as if butter would not melt in her mouth, but all is not gold that glistens—smooth water you know runs deepest,
<STAGE>(speaks this with sorrow)</STAGE>
I am sorry my young Master makes himself such a fool, very sorry, indeed; but um—ha—take my word for it, <HI>he</HI> is not the man,
<STAGE>(sneeringly)</STAGE>
for tho' she looks as modest as a maid at a christening.
<STAGE>(besi∣tating)</STAGE>
Yet, a—when sweet-hearts meet in the dusk of the evening—and stay together a whole hour in a dark grove—and—a—embrace—and kiss—and weep at parting—why then you know, Sir—it is easy to guess all the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, did Constantia meet any body in this manner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Starting with surprise.)</STAGE>
O, Heavens! I beg, Sir, you will not misapprehend me! for I assure you I do not believe they did any harm—that is—not in the grove—at least not when I was there—and she may be honestly married for aught I know.—O lud! Sir, I would not say an ill thing of Miss Constantia for all the world—for to besure she is a good creature—'tis true my Lady took her in for charity—and, indeed, has bred her up to the music, and figures—ay, and to reading all the books about Homer—and Paradise—and Gods and Devils—and every thing in the world—as if she had been a Duchess;—but some people are born with luck in their mouths—and then, as the saying is, you may throw them into the sea—
<STAGE>(deports herself most affectedly.)</STAGE>
—but if I had had dancing masters, and music, and French monsieurs to teach <HI>me,</HI>
<STAGE>(smiles, coquets, and puts on important airs of affectation.)</STAGE>
I be∣lieve I might read the globes, and the maps, and have danced, and have been as clever as other folks.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—No doubt of it, Mrs Betty, no doubt in the least.—But, Mrs. Betty, you mentioned something of a dark walk—about kissing—a sweet∣heart—and Constantia.</P>

<P>O lud!

<P>What can this ridiculous creature mean—by her dark walk—her private spark—her kissing—and all her slanderous insinuations against Constantia, whose con∣duct is as unblameable as innocence itself? I see envy is as malignant in a paltry waiting wench, as in the vainest or most ambitious Lady of the Court.

<P>I will not see them—What is to be done? Inform his Father of his intended marriage.—No; that must not be—for the overbearing temper, and ambitious policy of Sir Pertinax, would exceed all bounds of moderation. He has banished one Son already, only for daring to differ from his judgment concerning the merits of Scotch and English historians.—But this young Man must not marry Constantia—wou'd his Mo∣ther were here:—she, I suppose, knows nothing of his indiscretion, but she shall the moment she comes hither—I know it will offend him—no matter, it is our duty to offend, when the offence saves the Man we love from a precipitate action, which the world must con∣demn, and his own heart, perhaps, upon reflection, for ever repent.—Yes, I must discharge the duty of my function, and a friend, tho' I am sure to lose the Man whom I intend to serve.

<P>O! Sir, experience but too severely proves, that such unequal matches as ours, never produce aught but contempt and anger in parents, censure from the world, and a long train of sorrow and repentance in the wretched parties, which is but too often entailed upon their hapless issue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, I have not, Sir—I am a dependant on my Lady—a poor, forsaken, helpless orphan, your benevolent mother found me; took me to her bosom, and there supplied my parental loss, with every tender care indulgent dalliance, and with all the sweet persua∣sion that maternal fondness, religious precepts, polished manners, and hourly example cou'd administer. She fostered me,
<STAGE>(weeps)</STAGE>
and shall I now turn viper, and, with black ingratitude, sting the tender heart that thus has cherished me? Shall I seduce her house's heir, and kill her peace?—No; tho' I loved to the mad extreme of female fondness—tho' every worldly bliss, that woman's vanity, or man's ambition cou'd desire, fol∣lowed the indulgence of my love; and all the contempt and misery of this life, the denial of that indulgence, I would discharge my duty to my benefactress, my earthly guardian, my more than parent.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, ever since your mother's uncle (Sir Stanly Egerton) left you this three thousand pounds a year, and that you have, in compliance with his will, taken up the name of Egerton, they think you are growing proud, that you have estranged yourself fra the Mac Sycophants—have associated with your mo∣ther's family—with the opposeetion, and with those who do not wish weel to Scotland—besides, Sir, in a conversation the other day after dinner, at your cousin Campbell M'Kenzie's, before a whole table full of your ayn relations, did you not publicly wish a total extin∣guishment

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dootless, Sir, ye are a blockhead—Nae, Sir, I'll tell you how I raised it, Sir—I raised it by boowing—by boowing, Sir.—I never i' my life could stand straight i' the presence of a great man; but was aw ways booing, and booing, and booing—ass—ass—if it were by instinct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean by instinct, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I mean by instinct, why, Sir, I mean by—by—by the instinct of interest, Sir, which is the universal instinct of mankind, Sir; it is wonder∣ful to think what a cordial, what an amicable, nay,
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
what an infaleeble influence, booing has upon the pride and vanity of human nature—Chairles, answer me sincerely, hai ye a mind till be convinced of the force of my doctrine, by example and demonstration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, as the greatest favour I can confer upon you, I will gi ye a short sketch of the stages of my bowing, ass an excitement, and a land∣mark for ye till bow by, and ass an infaleeable nostrum for a man of the world, till thrive in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall be proud to profit by your ex∣perience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vary weel, Sir—sit ye down then
<STAGE>(both sit)</STAGE>
and now, Sir, you must recall till your thoughts, that your Grandfather was a man whose penurious in∣come of Captain's half-pay, was the sum total of his for∣tune; and, Sir, aw my proveesion fra him, was a medium of Latin, an expartness at areethmatic, and a short system of worldly counsel, the chief ingredients of whach were, a persevering industry—a reegid oeconomy—a smooth tongue—a pliabeelity of temper—and a con∣stant attention till make every great man well pleased we himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very prudent conduct, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore, Sir, I lay it before ye.—Now, Sir, wi these materials, I set out a rough, rawboned strippling fra the North, till try my fortune we them here i' the sooth—and my first step intull the world, was a beggarly clerkship in Sawney Gordon's coonting∣house, here in the city of London, whach you'll say afforded but a barren sort of a prospect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was not a very fertile one, indeed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reverse—the reverse—weel, Sir, seeing my sel in this unprofitable seetuation, I reflacted deeply. I cast aboot my thoughts, and concluded that a matrimonial adventure, prudently conducted, would be the readiest gate I could gang for the better∣ing of my condition, and accordingly I set aboot it, now, Sir, in this pursuit—beauty—beauty—ah I beauty often struck mine een, and played aboot my heart—and fluttered, and beat, and knocked—and
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
knocked—but the deel an entrance I ever let it get—for I observed, that beauty is generally a prood, vain, saucy, expensive sort of a commodity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very justly observed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And therefore I left it to the prodigals and coxcombs, that could afford till pay for it, and its stead, Sir, mark—I luock'd oot for an antient, well jointered, superanuated Dowager—a consumptive, toothless, ptisical, wealthy widow—or a shreeveled, cadaverous, neglected piece of deformity, i' the shape of an eezard, or an appersiand—or in short, any thing—any thing that had the siller—the siller—for that was the North star of my affection; do you take me, Sir—was nai that right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>O doubtless, doubtless, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, where do ye think I ganged to luock for this woman we the siller? Nai till court—nai till play-houses, nor assemblies—nai, Sir, I ganged till the kirk—till the anabaptist, eendependant, bra∣dleonian, muckletonian meetings—till the morning and evening service of churches and chapples of ease—and till the midnight, melting, conciliating love-feasts of the methodists—and there, at last, Sir, I fell upon an old, rich, sower, slighted, antiquated, musty maiden. She was as tall as a grenadier, and so thin that she luocked ha! ha! ha! she luocked—just like a skeleton in a surgeons's glass-case—Now, Sir, this meeserable object, was releegiously angry wi herself, and aw the world—and had nai comfort but in a super∣natural, vicious, and enthusiastic delirums; ha! ha! ha! Sir, she was mad—ass mad as a bedlamite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not impossible, Sir—there are numbers of poor creatures in the same condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>O numbers, numbers—now, Sir, this cracked creature used to pray, and sing, and sigh, and groan, and weep, and wail, and gnash her teeth constantly, morning and evening, at the Tabernacle, in Moor-fields, and as soon as I found she had the siller, aha!—in gude truth, I plumpt me doon upon my knees, close by her, cheek by jole, and praid, and sighed, and groaned, and gnashed my teeth, as ve∣hemently
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
ass she could do for the life of her—ay, and turned up the whites of mine een, till the strings awmost crackt again—Weel, Sir, I watched her motions—handed her till her chair—waited on her home—got most releegiously intimate we her—in a week married her—in a fortnight buried her—in a month touched the siller—and we a deep suit of mourning, a melancholy port, a sorrowful veesage, and a joyful heart, I began the world again—and this, Sir, was the first effectual boow I ever made, till the vanity of human nature.—Now, Sir, d'ye understand this doctrine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly well, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, boot was it not right? Was it not ingenious, and weel hit off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Extremely well, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>My next boow, Sir, was till your ain meether, whom I ran away wi fra the boarding school—by the interest of whose family, I got a good smart place in the Treasury—and, Sir, my vary next step was in till Parliament—the whach I entered we as ar∣dent, and ass determined an ambeetion ass ever agitated the heart o' Ceaser himself!—and then, Sir, I changed my character entirely.—Sir, I bowed, and watched, and harkened, and lurked for intilligence, and ran aboot backwards and forwards, and attended, and dangled upon the then great Mon, till I got intill the very boowels of his confeedence; and then, Sir, I wriggled, and wriggled, and wrought, and wriggled till I wriggled myself among the vary thick o' them, till I got my snack of the cloathing, the foraging, the contracts, the lottery teeckets, and aw the poleetical bonusses—till at length, Sir I became a much weal∣thier Mon, than one half o' the golden calves I had been so long a boowing to—
<STAGE>(he rises, Egerton rises too.)</STAGE>
And was not that boowing to some purpose, Sir?—Ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was indeed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you convinced of the gude ef∣fects, and of the uteelity of boowing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thoroughly, Sir, thoroughly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is infaleeble—but, Chairles, ah! while I was thus boowing, and wriggling, and making
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
a princely fortune—ah! I met many heart sores, and disappointments, frai the want of leeterature, ailo∣quence, and other popular abeelities Sir, guin I could hai both spoken i' the house, I shou'd hai done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he deed in half the time—boot the eenstant I opened my mouth there, they aw fell a laughing at me—aw whach deefeeciencies.

Sir, all my extravagant leveety and redeeculous be∣haviour in your presence, noow, and ever since your faither prevailed on mine to consent till this match, has been a premeditated scheme, to provoke your gravity and gude sense intill a cordial disgust and posi∣tive refusal.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you have contrived, and acted your scheme most happily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Rodol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then since Cupid has thus luockeely dis∣posed of ye till your Constantia, and me till my swain, we hai naithing till think of noow, Sir, but to contrive hoow to reduce the inordinate passions of oor parents intill a temper of prudence and humanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly I consent to your proposal; but with your leave, Madam, if I may presume so far, pray who is your lover?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Rodol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why in that too I shall surprise you per∣haps mere than ever—In the first place, he is a beggar, and in disgrace wi an unforgiving Faither—and in the next place. Sir, he is
<STAGE>(<HI>curtseys</HI>)</STAGE>
your ain Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Is it possible?</P>
</SP>

<P>A most amorous truth, Sir; that is ass far ass a woman can answer for her ain heart; so you

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, give me leave to congratulate my∣self upon your affection—you could not have placed it on a worthier object, and whatever is to our chance in this lottery of our parents, be assured, that my for∣tune shall be devoted to your happiness and his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Rodol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous indeed; Cousin, but not awhit nobler, I assure you, than your brother Sandy believes of you; and be assured, Sir, that we shall remember it, while the heart feels, or memory retains a sense of gratitude.—But noow, Sir, let me ask one question—pray how is your Mother affected in this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>She knows of my passion, and will, I am sure, be a friend to the common cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Rodol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that's lucky; our first step then must be to take her advice in our conduct, so as to keep our faithers in the dark, till we can bit off some measure, that wee'll wind them aboot till oor ain purpose, and the common interest of our ain passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very right, Madam, for should my father suspect my brother's affection for your Ladyship, or mine for Constantia, there is no guessing what would be the consequence; his whole happiness depends upon this bargain with my Lord, for it gives him the posses∣sion of three boroughs, and those, Madam, are much dearer to him, than the happiness of his children; I am sorry to say it, but to gratify his political rage, he would sacrifice every social tie that is dear to friend or family.

<P>He is very positive, indeed, Sir Pertinax, and no doubt, was intemperate and rude—But, Sir Pertinax, I would not break off the match notwith∣standing; for certainly, even without the boroughs, it is a very advantageous bargain to you, and your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But zoons, Plausible, do you think I will gee up the nomineetion till three boroughs?

<P>Why, yes, in the first sketch of the agree∣ment, I believe I did consent, but at that time, mon, my Lords affairs did not appear to be half so desperate, ass I now find they turn oot—Sir, he must be acqueese in whatever I demand—For I hai gotten him into sic an hobble, that he canno exeest without me.</P>

<P>Why Serjeant Eitherside, I have some rea∣son to think that my Lord is tied down by some means or other to bring the Serjeant in the very first vacancy for one of those boroughs—now that I believe is the

<P>He looks something like one, Sir—a sort of a Gentleman—he seems to be a kind of a Gentleman, but he seems to be in a kind of a passion, for when I asked his name, he answered hastily—'tis no matter friend—go tell your Master, there's a Gentleman here that must speak to him directly.</P>

<P>You seem to be a soldier, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was, Sir, and have the soldier's certificate to prove my service, rags and scars—in my heart for ten long years, in India's parching clime, I bore my country's cause, and in the noblest dangers sustained it with my sword; at length ungrateful peace has laid me down, where welcome war first took me up—in po∣verty, and the dread of cruel creditors—paternal af∣fection brought me to my native land, in quest of an only child—I found her, as I thought, amiable as pa∣rental fondness could desire—but lust and foul seduc∣tion, have snatched her from me—and hither am I come, fraught with a father's anger, and a soldier's honour, to seek the seducer, and glut revenge.</P>

<P>I am that man, Sir, but pray what is your evidence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>These bills, and these gorgeous jewels, not to be had in her menial state, but at the price of chas∣tity—not an hour since she sent them, impudently sent them, by a servant of this house—Contagious infamy started from their touch!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, perhaps you may be mistaken concern∣ing the terms on which she received them—do you but clear her conduct with Melville, and I will instantly satisfy your fears concerning the jewels and her virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you give me new life—you are my bet∣ter angel—I believe—I believe in your words—your looks—know then, I am that Melville.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hoow, Sir—ye that Melville?—that was at Farmer Hodges's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same, Sir—It was he brought my Con∣stantia to my arms—lodged and secreted me—once my lowly tenant, now my only friend; the fear of inexor∣able creditors made me change my name from Harring∣ton to Melville—till I cou'd see and consult some, who once called themselves my friends.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, suspend your fears and anger but for a few minutes, I will keep my word with you religiously,

The clearing up this wanche's vartue is damn'd unlooky!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, Sir, but it is an observation among soldiers, that there are some men who never meet with any thing in the service but blows and ill fortune—I was one of those, even to a proverb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Pert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! 'tis a pity, Sir, a great pity noow, that ye did nai get a Mogul, or some sic an animal in∣till your clutches.—Ah!

<P>Nay, nay, my Lord, ass I had nai reason till have the least affection till my cousin Egerton, and ass my intended marriage wi him was intirely an act of obedience till my grandmaither, provided my cousin Sandy will be ass agreeable till her Ladyship, ass my cousin Chairles here wou'd hai been—I hai nai the least objection till the change—ay, ay, upon honor, yean brother is ass gude till Rodolpha ass another.</P>

<P>These precarious turns of fortune, Sir, will press upon the heart, for notwithstanding my Constan∣tia's happiness, and mine in hers, I own, I cannot help feeling some regret, that my misfortunes should be the cause of any disagreement between a father and the man, to whom I am under the most endearing obligations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Egert.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have no share in this disagreement—for had not you been born, from my father's nature, some other cause of his resentment must have hap∣pen'd,—but for a time, Sir, at least, and I hope for life, afflictions, and angry vicissitudes have taken their leave of us all. If affluence can procure content and ease, they are within our reach—my fortune is ample, and shall be dedicated to the happiness of this domestic circle.</P>
