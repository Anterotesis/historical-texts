<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON HOMER's Battels.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS it may be necessary in this Place at the Opening of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Battels, to premise some Obser∣vations upon them in general. I shall first endeavour to shew the <HI>Conduct</HI> of the Poet herein, and next collect some <HI>Antiquities,</HI> that tend to a more distinct under∣standing of those Descriptions which make so large a Part of the Poem.</P>
<P>One may very well apply to <HI>Homer</HI> himself what he says of his Heroes at the end of the fourth Book, that whosoever should be guided thro' their Battels by <HI>Minerva,</HI> and pointed to every Scene of them, would see nothing through the whole but Subjects of Surprize and Applause. When the Reader re∣flects that no less than the Compass of twelve Books is taken up in these, he will have Reason to wonder by what Methods our Author could prevent Descriptions of such a length from being tedious. It is not enough to say, that tho' the Subject itself be the same, the Actions are always different; That we have now distinct Combates, now promiscuous Fights, now single Duels, now general Engagements: Or that the Scenes are perpetually vary'd; we are now in the Fields, now at the Fortification of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> now at the Ships, now at the Gates
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
of <HI>Troy,</HI> now at the River <HI>Scamander:</HI> But we must look far∣ther into the Art of the Poet to find the Reasons of this asto∣nishing Variety.</P>
<P>We may first observe that <HI>Diversity</HI> in the <HI>Deaths</HI> of his <HI>Warriors,</HI> which he has supply'd by the vastest Fertility of Invention that ever was. These he distinguishes several ways: Sometimes by the <HI>Characters</HI> of the Men, their <HI>Age, Office, Profession, Nation, Family,</HI> &amp;c. One is a blooming <HI>Youth,</HI> whose Father dissuaded him from the War; one is a <HI>Priest</HI> whose Piety could not save him; one is a <HI>Sportsman</HI> whom <HI>Diana</HI> taught in vain; one is the <HI>Native</HI> of a far-distant <HI>Coun∣try</HI> who is never to return; one is descended from a Noble <HI>Line</HI> which ends in his Death; one is made remarkable by his <HI>Boasting;</HI> another by his <HI>Beseeching;</HI> and another who is distinguish'd no way else is mark'd by his <HI>Habit</HI> and the Sin∣gularity of his Armor.</P>
<P>Sometimes he varies these Deaths by the several <HI>Postures</HI> in which his Heroes are represented either fighting or falling. Some of these are so exceedingly <HI>exact,</HI> that one may guess from the very Position of the Combatant, whereabouts the Wound will light: Others so very <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>uncommon,</HI> that they could only be the Effect of an Imagination which had search'd thro' all the Ideas of Nature. Such is that Pi∣cture of <HI>Mydon</HI> in the fifth Book, whose Arm being numb'd by a blow on the Elbow, drops the Reins that trail on the Ground; and then being suddenly struck on the Temples falls headlong from the Chariot in a soft and deep Place; where he sinks up to the Shoulders in the Sands, and continues a while fix'd by the Weight of his Armor, with his Legs quivering in the Air, 'till he is trampled down by his Horses.</P>
<P>Another Cause of this Variety is the Difference of the <HI>Wounds</HI> that are given in the Ilaid: They are by no means like the Wounds described by most other Poets, which are commonly made in the self-same obvious Places: The Heart and Head serve for all those in general who under∣stand no Anatomy, and sometimes for Variety they kill Men by Wounds that are no where mortal but in their Poems. As the whole human Body is the Subject of these, so no∣thing is more necessary to him who would describe them
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
well, than a thorough Knowledge of its Structure; even tho' the Poet is not professedly to write of them as an Anatomist; in the same manner as an exact Skill in Anatomy is necessary to those Painters that would excel in drawing the Naked, tho' they are not to make every Muscle as visible as in a Book of Chirurgery. It appears from so many Passages in <HI>Homer</HI> that he was perfectly Master of this Science, that it would be need∣less to cite any in particular. One may only observe, that if we thoroughly examine all the Wounds he has described, tho' so infinite in Number, and so many ways diversify'd, we shall hardly find one which will contradict this Observation.</P>
<P>I must just add a Remark, that the various Periphrases and Circumlocutions by which <HI>Homer</HI> expresses the single Act of <HI>Dying,</HI> have supply'd <HI>Virgil</HI> and the succeeding Poets with all their manners of phrasing it. Indeed he repeats the same Verse on that Occasion more often than they—<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But tho' it must be owned he had more frequent Occasions for a Line of this Kind than any Poet, as no other has describ'd half so many Deaths, yet one cannot ascribe this to any Sterility of Expres∣sion, but to the Genius of his Times, that delighted in those reiterated Verses. We find Repetitions of the same sort affe∣cted by the sacred Writers, such as <HI>He was gathered to his People; He slept with his Fathers,</HI> and the like. And upon the whole they have a certain antiquated Harmony not unlike the Burthen of a Song, which the Ear is willing to suffer, and as it were rests upon.</P>
<P>As the perpetual Horror of Combates, and a Succession of Images of Death, could not but keep the Imagination very much on the stretch; <HI>Homer</HI> has been careful to contrive such Reliefs and Pauses as might divert the Mind to some other Scene, without losing Sight of his prin∣cipal Object. His <HI>Comparisons</HI> are the more frequent on this Account; for a <HI>Comparison</HI> serves this End the most effectually of any thing, as it is at once correspondent to, and differing from the Subject. Those Criticks who fancy that the Use of Comparisons distracts the Attention, and draws it from the first Image which should most employ it (as that we lose the Idea of the Battel itself, while we are led by a Si∣mile
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
to that of a Deluge or a Storm:) Those, I say, may as well imagine we lose the Thought of the Sun, when we see his Reflection in the Water; where he appears more distinct∣ly, and is contemplated more at ease than if we gaz'd direct∣ly at his Beams. For 'tis with the Eye of the Imagination as with our corporeal Eye, it must sometimes be taken off from the Object in order to see in the better. The same Criticks that are displeased to have their Fancy distracted (as they call it) are yet so inconsistent with themselves as to object to <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> that his Similes are too much alike, and are too often derived from the same Animal. But is it not more reasona∣ble (according to their own Notion) to compare the same Man always to the same Animal, than to see him sometimes a Sun, sometimes a Tree, and sometimes a River? Tho' <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> speaks of the same Creature, he so diversifies the Cir∣cumstances and Accidents of the Comparisons, that they al∣ways appear quite different. And to say Truth, it is not so much the Animal or the Thing, as the Action or Posture of them, that employs our Imagination: Two different Animals in the same Action are more like to each other, than one and the same Animal is to himself, in two different Actions. And those who in reading <HI>Homer</HI> are shock'd that 'tis always a <HI>Lion,</HI> may as well be angry that 'tis always a <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>What may seem more exceptionable is his inserting the same Comparisons in the same Words at length upon different Occa∣sions, by which Management he makes one single Image afford many Ornaments to several Parts of the Poem. But may not one say <HI>Homer</HI> is in this like a skilful Improver, who pla∣ces a beautiful Statue in a well-disposed Garden so as to answer several Vistas, and by that Artifice one single Figure seems multiply'd into as many Objects as there are Openings from whence it may be viewed?</P>
<P>What farther relieves and softens these Descriptions of Bat∣tels, is the Poet's wonderful Art of introducing many pathetick Circumstances about the Deaths of the Heroes, which raise a different Movement in the Mind from what those Images na∣turally inspire, I mean Compassion and Pity; when he causes us to look back upon the lost Riches, Possessions, and Hopes of those who die: When he transports us to their Native
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Countries and Paternal Seats, to see the Griefs of their aged Fathers, the Despair and Tears of their Widows, or the aban∣don'd Condition of their Orphans. Thus when <HI>Protesilaus</HI> falls, we are made to reflect on the lofty Palaces he left half finish'd; when the Sons of <HI>Phenops</HI> are killed, we behold the mortifying Distress of their wealthy Father, who saw his E∣state divided before his Eyes, and taken in Trust for Strangers. When <HI>Axylus</HI> dies, we are taught to compassionate the hard Fate of that generous and hospitable Man, whose House was the House of all Men, and who deserv'd that glorious Elogy of, <HI>The Friend of Human-kind.</HI></P>
<P>It is worth taking Notice too, what Use <HI>Homer</HI> every where makes of each little Accident or Circumstance that can natu∣rally happen in a Battel, thereby to cast a Variety over his Action; as well as of every Turn of Mind or Emotion a He∣ro can possibly feel, such as Resentment, Revenge, Concern, Confusion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The former of these makes his Work re∣semble a large History-Piece, where even the less important Figures and Actions have yet some convenient Place or Cor∣ner to be shewn in; and the latter gives it all the Advanta∣ges of Tragedy in those various Turns of Passion that animate the Speeches of his Heroes, and render his whole Poem the most <HI>Dramatick</HI> of any Epick whatsoever.</P>
<P>It must also be observ'd that the constant <HI>Machines</HI> of the <HI>Gods</HI> conduce very greatly to vary these long Battels, by a continual Change of the Scene from Earth to Heaven. <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> perceiv'd them too necessary for this Purpose to abstain from the Use of them, even after <HI>Jupiter</HI> had enjoin'd the Deities not to Act on either side. It is remarkable how many Methods he has found to draw them into every Book; where if they dare not assist the Warriors, at least they are very helpful to the Poet.</P>
<P>But there is nothing that more contributes to the Variety, Surprize, and <HI>Eclat</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Battels, or is more perfectly admirable in itself, than that artful Manner of taking Mea∣sure, or (as one may say) <HI>Gaging</HI> his Heroes by each other, and thereby elevating the Character of one Person by the Opposition of it to that of some other whom he is made to excell. So that he many times describes one only to image
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
another, and raises one only to raise another. I cannot bet∣ter exemplify this Remark, than by giving an Instance in the Character of <HI>Diomed</HI> that lies before me. Let us observe by what a Scale of Oppositions he elevates this Hero, in the fifth Book, first to excell all human Valour, and after to rival the Gods themselves. He distinguishes him first from the <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> Captains in general, each of whom he represents con∣quering a single <HI>Trojan,</HI> while <HI>Diomed</HI> constantly encounters two at once; and while they are engag'd each in his distinct Post, he only is drawn fighting in every quarter, and slaugh∣tering on every side. Next he opposes him to <HI>Pandarus,</HI> next to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and then to <HI>Hector.</HI> So of the Gods he shews him first against <HI>Venus,</HI> then <HI>Apollo,</HI> then <HI>Mars,</HI> and lastly in the eighth Book against <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself in the midst of his Thunders. The same Conduct is observable more or less in regard to every Personage of his Work.</P>
<P>This Subordination of the Heroes is one of the Causes that make each of his Battels rise above the other in Greatness, Terror, and Importance, to the end of the Poem. If <HI>Dio∣med</HI> has perform'd all these Wonders in the first Combates, it is but to raise <HI>Hector,</HI> at whose Appearance he begins to fear. If in the next Battels <HI>Hector</HI> triumphs not only over <HI>Diomed,</HI> but over <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Patroclus,</HI> sets fire to the Fleet, wins the Armor of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and singly eclipses all the Heroes; in the midst of all this Glory, <HI>Achilles</HI> appears, <HI>Hector</HI> flies, and is slain.</P>
<P>The Manner in which his Gods are made to act, no less advances the Gradation we are speaking of. In the first Bat∣tels they are seen only in short and separate Excursions: <HI>Ve∣nus</HI> assists <HI>Paris, Minerva Diomed,</HI> or <HI>Mars Hector.</HI> In the next a clear Stage is left for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> to display his Omnipo∣tence and turn the Fate of Armies alone. In the last, all the Powers of Heaven are let down and banded into regular Parties, Gods encountring Gods, <HI>Jove</HI> encouraging them with his Thunders, <HI>Neptune</HI> raising his Tempests, Heaven flaming, Earth trembling, and <HI>Pluto</HI> himself starting from the Throne of Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
I AM now to take Notice of some Customs of Antiquity, relating to the Arms and Art Military of those Times, which are proper to be known in order to form a right Notion of our Author's Descriptions of War.</P>
<P>That <HI>Homer</HI> copied the Manners and Customs of the Age he writ of, rather than of that he lived in, has been obser∣ved in some Instances. As that he no where represents <HI>Ca∣valry</HI> or <HI>Trumpets</HI> to have been used in the <HI>Trojan</HI> Wars, tho' they apparently were in his own Time. It is not therefore im∣possible but there may be found in his Works some Deficiencies in the Art of War, which are not to be imputed to his Ig∣norance, but to his Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Horses</HI> had not been brought into <HI>Greece</HI> long before the Siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> They were originally Eastern Animals, and if we find at that very Period so great a Number of them reckon'd up in the Wars of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> it is the less a won∣der considering they came from <HI>Asia.</HI> The Practice of riding them was so little known in <HI>Greece</HI> a few Years before, that they look'd upon the <HI>Centaurs</HI> who first used it, as Monsters compounded of Men and Horses. <HI>Nestor</HI> in the first <HI>Iliad</HI> says he had seen these <HI>Centaurs</HI> in his Youth, and <HI>Polypaetes</HI> in the second is said to have been born on the Day that his Father expelled them from <HI>Pelion</HI> to the Desarts of <HI>Aethica.</HI> They had no other Use of Horses than to draw their Chari∣ots in Battel, so that whenever <HI>Homer</HI> speaks of <HI>fighting from an Horse, taming an Horse,</HI> or the like, it is constantly to be understood of fighting from a Chariot, or taming Horses to that Service. This (as we have said) was a piece of Deco∣rum in the Poet; for in his own Time they were arrived to such a Perfection in Horsemanship, that in the fifteenth <HI>Iliad</HI> ℣. 680. we have a <HI>Simile</HI> taken from an extraordinary Feat of Activity, where one Man manages four Horses at once, and leaps from the Back of one to another at full Speed.</P>
<P>If we consider in what high Esteem among Warriors these noble Animals must have been at their first coming into <HI>Greece,</HI> we shall the less wonder at the frequent Occasions <HI>Homer</HI> has taken to describe and celebrate them. It is not so strange to find them set almost upon a level with Men, at
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
the time when a <HI>Horse</HI> in the Prizes was of equal Value with a <HI>Captive.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chariots</HI> were in all Probability very low. For we fre∣quently find in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> that a Person who stands erect on a Chariot is killed (and sometimes by a Stroke on the Head) by a Foot-Soldier with a Sword. This may farther appear from the Ease and Readiness with which they alight or mount on every Occasion, to facilitate which, the Chariots were made open behind. That the Wheels were but small, may be guest from a Custom they had of taking them off and setting them on, as they were laid by, or made use of. <HI>Hebe</HI> in the fifth Book puts on the Wheels of <HI>Juno</HI>'s Chariot when she calls for it in haste. And it seems to be with Allusion to the same Practice that it is said in <HI>Exodus</HI> Ch. 14. <HI>The Lord took off their Chariot Wheels, so that they drove them heavily.</HI> The Sides were also low; for whoever is killed in his Chariot throughout the Poem, constantly falls to the Ground as having nothing to support him. That the whole Machine was very small and light, is evident from a Passage in the tenth <HI>Iliad,</HI> where <HI>Diomed</HI> having taken a Chariot, debates whether he shall draw it out of the way, or carry it on his Shoulders to a Place of Safety. All these Particulars agree with the Representations of the Chariots on the most ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Coins; where the Tops of them reach not so high as the Backs of the Horses, the Wheels are yet lower, and the Heroes who stand in them are seen from the Knee upwards. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Collection of <HI>Goltzius, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>This may serve to shew those Criticks are under a Mistake, who blame <HI>Homer</HI> for making his Warriors some∣times retire behind their Chariots, as if it were a Piece of Cowardice: which was as little disgraceful then, as it is now to alight from one's Horse in a Battel on any necessary Emergency.</P>
<P>There were generally two Persons in each Chariot, one of whom was wholly employ'd in guiding the Horses. They used indifferently two, three, or four Horses: From hence it happens, that sometimes when a Horse is killed, the Hero continues the Fight with the two or more that remain; and
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
at other times a Warrior retreats upon the Loss of one; not that he has less Courage than the other, but that he has fewer Horses.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Swords</HI> were all broad cutting Swords, for we find they never stab but with their Spears. The <HI>Spears</HI> were used two ways, either to push with, or to cast from them, like the missive Javelins. It seems surprizing that a Man should throw a Dart or Spear with such Force as to pierce thro' both sides of the Armor and the Body (as is often described in <HI>Homer.</HI>) For if the Strength of the Men was Gigantick, the Armor must have been strong in Proportion. Some Solution might be given for this, if we imagin'd the Armor was ge∣nerally Brass, and the Weapons pointed with Iron; and if we could fancy that <HI>Homer</HI> call'd the Spears and Swords <HI>Brazen</HI> in the same manner that he calls the Reins of a Bridle <HI>Ivo∣ry,</HI> only from the Ornaments about them. But there are Passages where the Point of the Spear is expressly said to be of Brass, as in the Description of that of <HI>Hector</HI> in <HI>Iliad</HI> 6. ℣. 320. <HI>Pausanias</HI> in <HI>Laconicis</HI> takes it for granted, that the Arms, as well offensive as defensive, were Brass. He says the Spear of <HI>Achilles</HI> was kept in his Time in the Temple of <HI>Mi∣nerva,</HI> the Top and Point of which were of Brass; and the Sword of <HI>Meriones,</HI> in that of <HI>Aesculapius</HI> among the <HI>Nicome∣dians,</HI> was entirely of the same Metal. But be it as it will, there are Examples even at this Day of such a prodigious Force in casting Darts, as almost exceeds Credibility. The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> will pierce thro' thick Planks with Darts of harden'd Wood; which can only be attributed to their being bred (as the Ancients were) to that Exercise, and to the Strength and Agility acquir'd by a constant Practice of it.</P>
<P>We may ascribe to the same Cause their Power of casting <HI>Stones</HI> of a vast Weight, which appears a common Practice in these Battels. Those are in a great Error, who imagine this to be only a fictitious Embellishment of the Poet, which was one of the Exercises of War among the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Orientals.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mos est in Urbibus Palestinae, &amp; usque hodie per omnem Judaeam vetus consuetudo ser∣vatur, ut in viculis, oppidis, &amp; castellis rotundi ponantur lapides gravissimi ponderis, ad quos juvenes exercere se solent, &amp; eos pro varietate virium sublevare, alii ad genua, alii ad umbilicum, alii ad humeros, ad caput, non nulli super verticem, rectis junctisque manibus, magnitudinem virium demonstrantes, pondus attollunt.</NOTE>St. <HI>Jerome</HI> tells us, it was an old Custom in
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<HI>Palestine,</HI> and in Use in his own Time, to have round Stones of a great Weight kept in the Castles and Villages for the Youth to try their Strength with. And the Custom is yet ex∣tant in some Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where Stones for the same Purpose are laid at the Gates of great Houses, which they call <HI>Putting-Stones.</HI></P>
<P>Another Consideration which will account for many things that may seem uncouth in <HI>Homer,</HI> is the Reflection that be∣fore the Use of <HI>Fire-Arms</HI> there was infinitely more Scope for personal Valor than in the modern Battels. Now whensoe∣ver the personal Strength of the Combatants happen'd to be unequal, the declining a single Combate could not be so dis∣honourable as it is in this Age, when the Arms we make use of put all Men on a level. For a Soldier of far inferior Strength may manage a Rapier or Fire-Arms so expertly as to be an Overmatch to his Adversary. This may appear a sufficient Excuse for what in the modern Construction might seem Cow∣ardice in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Heroes, when they avoid engaging with o∣thers whose bodily Strength exceeds their own. The Maxims of Valor in all Times were founded upon Reason, and the Cowardice ought rather in this Case to be imputed to him who braves his Inferior. There was also more <HI>Leisure</HI> in their Battels before the Knowledge of Fire-Arms; and this in a good Degree accounts for those Harangues his Heroes make to each other in the Time of Combate.</P>
<P>There was another Practice frequently used by these ancient Warriors, which was to spoil an Enemy of his Arms after they had slain him; and this Custom we see them frequently pursuing with such Eagerness as if they look'd on their Victory not complete 'till this Point was gain'd. Some modern Criticks have accused them of Avarice on ac∣count of this Practice, which might probably arise from the great Value and Scarceness of Armor in that early Time and Infancy of War. It afterwards became a Point of Honour like gaining a Standard from the Enemy. <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>David</HI> speak of the Pleasure of obtaining many Spoils. They preserv'd them as Monuments of Victory, and even Religion at last be∣came interested herein, when those Spoils were consecrated in the Temples of the Tutelar Deities of the Conqueror.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
The Reader may easily see I set down these Heads just as they occur to my Memory, and only as Hints to farther Observa∣tions; which any one who is conversant in <HI>Homer</HI> can not fail to make, if he will but think a little in the same Track.</P>
<P>It is no Part of my Design to enquire what Progress had been made in the Art of War at this early Period: The bare Perusal of the Iliad will best inform us of it. But what I think tends more immediately to the better Comprehension of these Descriptions, is to give a short View of the Scene of War, the Situation of <HI>Troy,</HI> and those Places which <HI>Homer</HI> mentions, with the proper Field of each Battel: Putting to∣gether for this Purpose those Passages in my Author that give any Light to this Matter.</P>
<P>The ancient City of <HI>Troy</HI> stood at a greater Distance from the Sea than those Ruins which have since been shewn for it. This may be gather'd from Iliad 5. ℣. (of the Original) 791. where it is said that the <HI>Trojans</HI> never durst sally out of the <HI>Walls</HI> of their Town 'till the Retirement of <HI>Achilles,</HI> but af∣terwards combated the <HI>Grecians</HI> at their very Ships, <HI>far from the City.</HI> For had <HI>Troy</HI> stood (as <HI>Strabo</HI> observes) so nigh the <HI>Sea-shore,</HI> it had been Madness in the <HI>Greeks</HI> not to have built any Fortification before their Fleet till the tenth Year of the Siege, when the Enemy was so near them: And on the o∣ther hand, it had been Cowardice in the <HI>Trojans</HI> not to have attempted any thing all that time, against an Army that lay unfortify'd and unintrench'd. Besides the intermediate Space had been too small to afford a Field for so many various Ad∣ventures and Actions of War. The Places about <HI>Troy</HI> parti∣cularly mentioned by <HI>Homer</HI> lie in this Order.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Scaean Gate:</HI> This open'd to the Field of Battel, and was that thro' which the <HI>Trojans</HI> made their Excursions. Close to this stood the <HI>Beech-Tree</HI> sacred to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> generally mentions with it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Hill</HI> of <HI>wild Fig-trees.</HI> It join'd to the Walls of <HI>Troy</HI> on one side, and extended to the High-way on the o∣ther. The first appears from what <HI>Andromache</HI> says in Iliad 6. ℣. 432. that <HI>the Walls were in danger of being scaled from this Hill;</HI> and the last from Il. 22. ℣. 145. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
3. The <HI>two Springs</HI> of <HI>Scamander.</HI> These were a little higher on the same High-way. (<HI>Ibid.</HI>)</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Callicolone,</HI> the Name of a pleasant Hill, that lay near the River <HI>Simois,</HI> on the other side of the Town. <HI>Il.</HI> 20. ℣. 53.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Bateia,</HI> or the Sepulchre of <HI>Myrinne,</HI> stood a little be∣fore the City in the Plain. <HI>Il.</HI> 2. ℣. 318. <HI>of the Catal.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The <HI>Monument</HI> of <HI>Ilus:</HI> Near the middle of the Plain. <HI>Il.</HI> 11. ℣. 166.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The Tomb of <HI>Aesyetes,</HI> commanded the Prospect of the Fleet, and that Part of the Sea-coast. <HI>Il.</HI> 2. ℣. 301. <HI>of the Catalogue.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>IT seems, by the 465<HI>th</HI> Verse of the second Iliad, that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army was drawn up under the several Leaders by the Banks of <HI>Scamander</HI> on that side toward the Ships: In the mean time that of <HI>Troy</HI> and the Auxiliaries was rang'd in Order at <HI>Myrinne</HI>'s Sepulchre. <HI>Ibid.</HI> ℣. 320 <HI>of the Catal.</HI> The Place of the <HI>First Battel</HI> where <HI>Diomed</HI> performs his Exploits, was near the joining of <HI>Simois</HI> and <HI>Scamander;</HI> for <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Pallas</HI> coming to him, alight at the Confluence of those Ri∣vers. <HI>Il.</HI> 5. ℣. 776. and that the <HI>Greeks</HI> had not yet past the Stream, but fought on that side next the Fleet, appears from ℣. 791 of the same Book, where <HI>Juno</HI> says <HI>the</HI> Trojans <HI>now brave them at their very Ships.</HI> But in the beginning of the sixth Book, the Place of Battel is specify'd to be between the Rivers of <HI>Simois</HI> and <HI>Scamander;</HI> so that the <HI>Greeks</HI> (tho' <HI>Homer</HI> does not particularize when, or in what manner) had then cross'd the Stream toward <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>The Engagement in the eighth Book is evidently close to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Fortification on the Shore. That Night <HI>Hector</HI> lay at <HI>Ilus</HI>'s Tomb in the Field, as <HI>Dolon</HI> tells us <HI>Lib.</HI> 10. ℣. 415. And in the eleventh Book the Battel is chiefly about <HI>Ilus</HI>'s Tomb.</P>
<P>In the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, about the Fortifi∣cation of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and in the fifteenth at the <HI>Ships.</HI></P>
<P>In the sixteenth, the <HI>Trojans</HI> being repulsed by <HI>Patroclus,</HI> they engage between the Fleet, the River, and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wall: See ℣. 396. <HI>Patroclus</HI> still advancing they fight at the Gates of <HI>Troy</HI> ℣. 700. In the seventeenth the Fight about the
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Body of <HI>Patroclus</HI> is under the <HI>Trojan</HI> Wall ℣. 403. His Body being carried off, <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> pursue the <HI>Greeks</HI> to the Fortification ℣. 760. And in the eighteenth, upon <HI>Achilles</HI>'s appearing, they retire and encamp without the Fortification.</P>
<P>In the twentieth, the Fight is still on that side next the Sea; for the <HI>Trojans</HI> being pursued by <HI>Achilles,</HI> pass over the <HI>Scamander</HI> as they run toward <HI>Troy:</HI> See the beginning of Book 21. The following Battels are either in the River itself, or between that and the City, under whose Walls <HI>Hector</HI> is kill'd in the twenty second Book, which puts an end to the Battels of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>

<P><HI>DIOMED,</HI> assisted by <HI>Pallas,</HI> performs Wonders in this Day's Battel. <HI>Pandarus</HI> wounds him with an Arrow, but the Goddess cures him, enables him to discern Gods from Mortals, and prohibits him from contending with any of the former, excepting <HI>Venus. Aeneas</HI> joins <HI>Pandarus</HI> to oppose him, <HI>Pandarus</HI> is killed, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> in great danger but for the Assistance of <HI>Venus;</HI> who, as she is removing her Son from the Fight, is wounded on the Hand by <HI>Diomed. Apollo</HI> seconds her in his Rescue, and at length carries off <HI>Aeneas</HI> to <HI>Troy,</HI> where he is heal'd in the Temple of <HI>Pergamus. Mars</HI> rallies the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and assists <HI>Hector</HI> to make a Stand. In the mean time <HI>Aeneas</HI> is restor'd to the Field, and they overthrow several of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> among the rest <HI>Tlepolemus</HI> is slain by <HI>Sarpedon. Juno</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> descend to resist <HI>Mars;</HI> the latter incites <HI>Dio∣med</HI> to go against that God; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to Heaven.</P>

<L>Know, 'tis not honest in my Soul to fear,</L>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 1. <HI>BUT</HI> Pallas <HI>now,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> As in every just History Picture there is one principal Figure, to which all the rest refer and are subservient; so in each Battel of the Iliad there is one principal Person, that may properly be call'd the Hero of that Day or Action. This Conduct preserves the Unity of the Piece, and keeps the Imagination from being distra∣cted and confused with a wild Number of independent Figures, which have no Subordination to each other. To make this pro∣bable, <HI>Homer</HI> supposes these extraordinary Measures of Courage to be the immediate Gift of the Gods; who bestow them some∣times upon one, and sometimes upon another, as they think fit to make them the Instruments of their Designs; an Opi∣nion conformable to true Theology. Whoever reflects upon this, will not blame our Author for representing the same Heroes brave at one time, and dispirited at another; just as the Gods assist, or abandon them on different Occasions.</P>

<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
sooner retired, but <HI>Homer</HI> raises his other <HI>Greeks</HI> to supply his Absence; like Stars that shine each in his due Revolution, till the principal Hero rises again, and eclipses all others. As <HI>Diomed</HI> is the first in this Office, he seems to have more of the Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> than any besides. He has naturally an Excess of Boldness and too much Fury in his Temper, for∣ward and intrepid like the other, and running after Gods or Men promiscuously as they offer themselves. But what differences his Character is, that he is soon reclaim'd by Advice, hears those that are more experienced, and in a word, obeys <HI>Minerva</HI> in all things. He is assisted by the Patroness of Wisdom and Arms, as he is eminent both for Prudence and Valor. That which characterizes his Prudence is a quick Sagacity and Presence of Mind in all Emergencies, and an undisturb'd Readiness in the very Article of Danger. And what is particular in his Valor is agreeable to these Qualities; his Actions being al∣ways performed with remarkable Dexterity, Activity, and Dispatch. As the gentle and manageable Turn of his Mind seems drawn with an Opposition to the boisterous Temper of <HI>Achilles,</HI> so his bodily Excellencies seem design'd as in Con∣traste to those of <HI>Ajax,</HI> who appears with great Strength, but heavy and unwieldy. As he is forward to act in the Field, so is he ready to speak in the Council: But 'tis observable that his Counsels still incline to War, and are byass'd rather on the side of Bravery than Caution. Thus he advises to reject the Proposals of the <HI>Trojans</HI> in the seventh Book, and not to accept of <HI>Helen</HI> her self, tho' <HI>Paris</HI> should offer her. In the ninth, he opposes <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Proposition to return to <HI>Greece,</HI> in so strong a manner, as to declare he will stay and continue the Siege himself, if the General should de∣part. And thus he hears without Concern <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Re∣fusal of a Reconciliation, and doubts not to be able to carry on the War without him. As for his private Character, he appears a gallant Lover of Hospitality in his Behaviour to <HI>Glaucus</HI> in the sixth Book; a Lover of Wisdom in his Assist∣ance of <HI>Nestor</HI> in the eighth, and his Choice of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to ac∣company him in the tenth; upon the whole, an open sin∣cere Friend, and a generous Enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72"/>
The wonderful Actions he performs in this Battel, seem to be the Effect of a noble Resentment at the Reproach he had receiv'd from <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in the foregoing Book, to which these Deeds are the Answer. He becomes immediately the second Hero of <HI>Greece,</HI> and dreaded equally with <HI>Achilles</HI> by the <HI>Trojans.</HI> At the first Sight of him his Enemies make a Question, Whether he is a Man or a God? <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Pandarus</HI> go against him, whose Approach terrifies <HI>Sthenelus,</HI> and the Apprehension of so great a Warrior marvellously exalts the Intrepidity of <HI>Diomed. Aeneas</HI> himself is not sav'd but by the interposing of a Deity: He pursues and wounds that Deity, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> again escapes only by the Help of a stronger Power, <HI>Apollo.</HI> He attempts <HI>Apollo</HI> too, retreats not till the God threatens him in his own Voice, and even then retreats but a few Steps. When he sees <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> himself in open Arms against him, he had not retir'd tho' he was wounded, but in Obedience to <HI>Minerva,</HI> and then retires with his Face toward them. But as soon as she permits him to engage with that God, he conquers, and sends him groaning to Heaven. What Invention and what Conduct appears in this whole Episode? What Boldness in raising a Character to such a Pitch, and what Judgment in raising it by such De∣grees? While the most daring Flights of Poetry are employ'd to move our Admiration, and at the same time the justest and closest Allegory, to reconcile those Flights to moral Truth and Probability? It may be farther remark'd, that the high Degree to which <HI>Homer</HI> elevates this Character, en∣ters into the principal Design of his whole Poem; which is to shew, that the greatest Personal Qualities and Forces are of no Effect when Union is wanting among the chief Rulers, and that nothing can avail till they are reconciled so as to act in Concert.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 5. <HI>High on his Helm Celestial Light'nings play.</HI>]</Q> This beautiful Passage gave occasion to <HI>Zoilus</HI> for an insipid Piece of Raillery, who ask'd how it happen'd that the Hero escap'd burning by these Fires that continually broke from
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
his Armor? <HI>Eustathius</HI> answers, that there are several Exam∣ples in History, of Fires being seen to break forth from hu∣man Bodies as Presages of Greatness and Glory. Among the rest, <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the Life of <HI>Alexander</HI> describes his Helmet much in this manner. This is enough to warrant the Ficti∣on, and were there no such Example, the same Author says very well that the Imagination of a Poet is not to be confi∣ned to strict Physical Truths. But all Objections may easily be removed, if we consider it as done by <HI>Minerva,</HI> who had determined this Day to raise <HI>Diomed</HI> above all the Heroes, and caused this Apparition to render him formidable. The Power of a God makes it not only allowable but highly no∣ble, and greatly imagined by <HI>Homer;</HI> as well as correspon∣dent to a Miracle in holy Scripture, where <HI>Moses</HI> is described with a Glory shining on his Face at his Descent from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> a Parallel which <HI>Spondanus</HI> has taken notice of.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> was too sensible of the Beauty of this Passage not to imitate it, and it must be owned he has surpassed his Original.<Q><L>Ardet apex capiti, cristisque ac vertice flamma</L>
<L>Funditur, &amp; vastos umbo vomit aureus ignes.</L>
<L>Non secus ac liquida si quando nocte Cometae</L>
<L>Sanguinei lugubre rubent: aut Sirius ardor,</L>
<L>Ille sitim morbosque ferens mortalibus aegris,</L>
<L>Nascitur, &amp; laevo contristat lumine caelum.</L></Q> In <HI>Homer</HI>'s Comparison there is no other Circumstance allu∣ded to but that of a remarkable Brightness: Whereas <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Comparison, beside this, seems to foretel the immense Slaughter his Hero was to make, by comparing him first to a Comet, which is vulgarly imagin'd a Prognostick, if not the real Cause of much Misery to Mankind; and again to the Dog-star, which appearing with the greatest Brightness in the latter end of Summer, is suppos'd the Occasion of all the Distempers of that sickly Season. And methinks the Ob∣jection of <HI>Macrobius</HI> to this Place is not just, who thinks the Simile unseasonably apply'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> because he was yet on his Ship, and had not begun the Battel. One may answer, that this miraculous Appearance could never be
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
more proper than at the first Sight of the Hero, to strike Terror into the Enemy, and to prognosticate his approach∣ing Victory.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 27. Idaeus <HI>fled, Left the rich Chariot.</HI>]</Q> It is finely said by M. <HI>Dacier,</HI> that <HI>Homer</HI> appears perhaps greater by the Criticisms that have been past upon him, than by the Praises which have been given him. <HI>Zoilus</HI> had a Cavil at this Place; he thought it ridiculous in <HI>Idaeus</HI> to descend from his Chariot to fly, which he might have done faster by the help of his Horses. Three things are said in answer to this; first, that <HI>Idaeus</HI> knowing the Passion which <HI>Diomed</HI> had for Horses, might hope the Pleasure of seizing these would re∣tard him from pursuing him. Next, that <HI>Homer</HI> might de∣sign to represent in this Action of <HI>Idaeus</HI> the common Effect of Fear, which disturbs the Understanding to such a degree, as to make Men abandon the surest means to save themselves. And then, that <HI>Idaeus</HI> might have some Advantage of <HI>Diomed</HI> in Swiftness, which he had reason to confide in. But I fancy one may add another Solution which will better account for this Passage. <HI>Homer</HI>'s word is <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which I believe would be better translated <HI>non perseveravit,</HI> than <HI>non sustinuit defen∣dere fratrem interfectum:</HI> and then the Sense will be clear, that <HI>Idaeus</HI> made an Effort to save his Brother's Body, which proving impracticable, he was obliged to fly with the utmost Precipitation. One may add, that his alighting from his Chariot was not that he could run faster on foot, but that he could sooner escape by mixing with the Crowd of com∣mon Soldiers. There is a Particular exactly of the same Na∣ture in the Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> Ch. 4. ℣. 15. where <HI>Sisera</HI> a∣lights to fly in the same manner.</P>

bitter Reproaches; but these will appear very properly applied to this warlike Deity. For Persons of this mar∣tial Character, who scorning Equity and Reason, carry all things by Force, are better pleas'd to be celebrated for their Power than their Virtue. Statues are rais'd to the Conquerors, that is, the Destroyers of Nations, who are com∣plemented for excelling in the Arts of Ruine. <HI>Demetrius</HI> the Son of <HI>Antigonus</HI> was celebrated by his Flatterers with the Ti∣tle of <HI>Poliorcetes,</HI> a Term equivalent to one here made use of.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 46. <HI>The God of Arms and martial Maid retreat.</HI>]</Q> The Retreat of <HI>Mars</HI> from the <HI>Trojans</HI> intimates that Cou∣rage forsook them: It may be said then, that <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Ab∣sence from the <HI>Greeks</HI> will signify that Wisdom deserted them also. It is true she does desert them, but it is at a time when there was more occasion for gallant Actions than for wise Counsels. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 48. <HI>The</HI> Greeks <HI>the</HI> Trojan <HI>Race pursue.</HI>]</Q> <HI>Homer</HI> always appears very zealous for the Honour of <HI>Greece,</HI> which alone might be a Proof of his being of that Country, against the Opinion of those who would have him of other Nations.</P>
<P>It is observable thro' the whole Ilaid, that he endeavours every where to represent the <HI>Greeks</HI> as superior to the <HI>Tro∣jans</HI> in Valor and the Art of War. In the beginning of the third Book he describes the <HI>Trojans</HI> rushing on to the Battel in a barbarous and confus'd manner, with loud Shouts and Cries, while the <HI>Greeks</HI> advance in the most profound Silence and exact Order. And in the latter Part of the fourth Book, where the two Armies march to the Engagement, the <HI>Greeks</HI> are animated by <HI>Pallas,</HI> while <HI>Mars</HI> instigates the <HI>Tro∣jans,</HI> the Poet attributing by this plain Allegory to the for∣mer a well-conducted Valor, to the latter rash Strength and brutal Force: So that the Abilities of each Nation are di∣stinguish'd by the Characters of the Deities who assist them.
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>
But in this Place, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, the Poet being wil∣ling to shew how much the <HI>Greeks</HI> excell'd their Enemies when they engag'd only with their proper Force, and when each side was alike destitute of divine Assistance, takes occa∣sion to remove the Gods out of the Battel, and then each <HI>Grecian</HI> Chief gives signal Instances of Valor superior to the <HI>Trojans.</HI></P>
<P>A modern Critick observes that this constant Superiority of the <HI>Greeks</HI> in the Art of War, Valor, and Number, is contradictory to the main Design of the Poem, which is to make the Return of <HI>Achilles</HI> appear necessary for the Preser∣vation of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> but this Contradiction vanishes when we reflect that the Affront given <HI>Achilles</HI> was the occasion of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s interposing in favour of the <HI>Trojans.</HI> Wherefore the Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> was not pernicious to the <HI>Greeks</HI> purely because it kept him inactive, but because it occasion'd <HI>Jupiter</HI> to afflict them in such a manner, as made it necessary to appease <HI>Achilles</HI> in order to render <HI>Jupiter</HI> propitious.</P>

<L><HI>Whose gen'rous Spouse</HI> Theano <HI>heav'nly Fair,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nurs'd the young Stranger with a Mother's Care.</HI></L></Q><HI>Homer</HI> in this remarkable Passage commends the fair <HI>Theano</HI> for breeding up a Bastard of her Husband's with the same Tenderness as her own Children. This Lady was a Wo∣man of the first Quality, and (as it appears in the sixth Iliad) the high Priestess of <HI>Minerva:</HI> So that one cannot imagine the Education of this Child was imposed upon her by the Au∣thority or Power of <HI>Antenor; Homer</HI> himself takes care to remove any such derogatory Notion, by particularizing the Motive of this unusual Piece of Humanity to have been to please her Husband, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Nor ought we to lessen this Commendation by thinking the Wives of those Times in general were more complaisant than those of our own. The Stories of <HI>Phoenix, Clytemnestra, Medea,</HI> and ma∣ny others, are plain Instances how highly the keeping of Mi∣stresses was resented by the married Ladies. But there was indeed a difference between the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Asiaticks</HI> as to their Notions of Marriage: For it is certain the latter al∣lowed Plurality of Wives; <HI>Priam</HI> had many lawful ones, and some of them Princesses who brought great Dowries. <HI>Theano</HI> was an <HI>Asiatick,</HI> and that is the most we can grant; for the Son she nurs'd so carefully was apparently not by a Wife, but by a Mistress; and her Passions were naturally the same with those of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Women. As to the Degree of Regard then shewn to the Bastards, they were carefully enough educated, tho' not (like this of <HI>Ante∣nor</HI>) as the lawful Issue, nor admitted to an equal share of Inheritance. <HI>Megapenthes</HI> and <HI>Nicostratus</HI> were excluded from the Inheritance of <HI>Sparta,</HI> because they were born of Bond-Women,
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
as <HI>Pausanias</HI> says. But <HI>Neoptolemus,</HI> a natural Son of <HI>Achilles</HI> by <HI>Deidamia,</HI> succeeded in his Father's Kingdom, per∣haps with respect to his Mother's Quality who was a Princess. Upon the whole, however that Matter stood, <HI>Homer</HI> was very favourable to Bastards, and has paid them more Complements than one in his Works. If I am not mistaken <HI>Ulysses</HI> reckons himself one in the <HI>Odysseis.

And certainly Gods of human Shape cannot justly be esteemed or described otherwise, than as a celestial Race, superior only to mortal Men by greater Abili∣ties, and a more extensive Degree of Wisdom and Strength, subject however to the necessary Inconveniencies consequent to corporeal Beings. <HI>Cicero</HI> in his Book <HI>de Nat.

<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
as Examples to such: On this Supposition, he blames him for proposing immoderate Laughter as a thing de∣cent in great Men. I forgot to take notice in its proper Place, that the Epither <HI>inextinguishable</HI> is not to be taken li∣terally for dissolute or ceasless Mirth, but was only a Phrase of that time to signify Chearfulness and seasonable Gayety; in the same manner as we may now say, <HI>to die with Laughter,</HI> without being understood to be in danger of dying with it.

This is the Language of Poetry, which prefers a marvellous Fiction to a plain and simple Truth, the Recital whereof would be cold and unaffecting. Thus <HI>Minerva</HI>'s guiding a Javelin, signifies only that it was thrown with Art and Dexterity; <HI>Mars</HI> taking upon him the Shape of <HI>Acamas,</HI> that the Cou∣rage of <HI>Acamas</HI> incited him to do so, and in like manner of the rest. The present Passage is copied by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the tenth <HI>Aeneid,</HI> where the Spectre of <HI>Aeneas</HI> is raised by <HI>Juno</HI> or the <HI>Air,</HI> as it is here by <HI>Apollo</HI> or the <HI>Sun;</HI> both equally proper to be employ'd in forming an Apparition.

It happens frequently in very calm Weather, that the Atmosphere is charg'd with thick Vapors, whose Gravity is such, that they neither rise nor fall, but remain poiz'd in the Air at a certain Height, where they continue frequently for several Days together. In a plain Country this occasions no other visible Appearance, but of an uniform clouded Sky; but in a Hilly Region these Vapors are to be seen covering the Tops and stretch'd along the Sides of the Mountains, the clouded Parts above being terminated and distinguish'd from the clear Parts below by a strait Line running parallel to the Horizon, as far as the Mountains extend. The whole Compass of Nature cannot afford a nobler and more exact Representa∣tion of a numerous Army, drawn up in Line of Battel, and expecting the Charge. The long-extended even front, the
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
Closeness of the Ranks; the Firmness, Order, and Silence of the whole, are all drawn with great Resemblance in this one Comparison. The Poet adds, that this Appearance is while <HI>Boreas</HI> and the other boisterous Winds which disperse and break the Clouds, are laid asleep. This is as exact as it is Poetical; for when the Winds arise, this regular Order is soon dissolv'd.

some of the Commentators, who thought <HI>Homer</HI> design'd it as a Reproof of an undistinguish'd Generosity. It is evident∣ly a Panegyrick on that Virtue, and not improbably on the Memory of some excellent, but unfortunate Man in that Coun∣try, whom the Poet honours with the noble Title of <HI>A Friend to Mankind.</HI> It is indeed a severe Reproof of the Ingratitude of Men, and a kind of Satyr on human Race, while he repre∣sents this Lover of his Species miserably perishing without Assistance from any of those Numbers he had obliged. This Death is very moving, and the Circumstance of a faithful Servant's dying by his side, well imagined, and natural to such a Character. His manner of keeping House near a fre∣quented Highway, and relieving all Travellers, is agreeable to that ancient Hospitality which we now only read of. There is Abundance of this Spirit every where in the <HI>Odysseis.</HI> The Patriarchs in the Old Testament sit at their Gates to see those who pass by, and entreat them to enter into their Houses: This cordial manner of Invitation is particularly described in the 18<HI>th</HI> and 19<HI>th</HI> Chapters of <HI>Genesis.</HI> The <HI>Eastern</HI> Nati∣ons seem to have had a peculiar Disposition to these Exercises of Humanity, which continues in a great measure to this Day. It is yet a Piece of Charity frequent with the <HI>Turks,</HI> to erect <HI>Caravanserahs,</HI> or Inns for the Reception of Travellers. Since I am upon this Head, I must mention one or two extraordi∣nary Examples of ancient Hospitality. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> writes of <HI>Gallias</HI> of <HI>Agrigentum,</HI> that having built severall Inns for the Relief of Strangers, he appointed Persons at the Gates to invite all who travell'd to make use of them; and that this Example was followed by many others who were inclined af∣ter the ancient manner to live in a human and beneficent Correspondence with Mankind. That this <HI>Gallias</HI> entertain'd and cloathed at one time no less than five hundred Horse∣men; and that there were in his Cellars three hundred Ves∣sels, each of which contain'd an hundred Hogsheads of Wine. The same Author tells us of another <HI>Agrigentine,</HI> that at the Marriage of his Daughter feasted all the People of his City, who at that time were above twenty thousand.</P>
<P><HI>Herodotus</HI> in his seventh Book has a Story of this kind, which is prodigious, being of a private Man so immensely

rich as to entertain <HI>Xerxes</HI> and his whole Army. I shall transcribe the Passage as I find it translated to my Hands.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"<HI>Pythius</HI> the Son of <HI>Atys,</HI> a <HI>Lydian,</HI> then residing in <HI>Celaene,</HI> entertain'd the King and all his Army with great Magnificence, and offer'd him his Treasures towards the Expence of the War: which Liberality <HI>Xerxes</HI> communi∣cating to the <HI>Persians</HI> about him, and asking who this <HI>Pythius</HI> was, and what Riches he might have to enable him to make such an Offer? Receiv'd this Answer; <HI>Py∣thius,</HI> said they, is the Person who presented your Father <HI>Darius</HI> with a Plane-Tree and Vine of Gold: and after you, is the richest Man we know in the World. <HI>Xerxes</HI> surpriz'd with these last Words, ask'd him to what Sum his Treasures might amount. I shall conceal nothing from you, said <HI>Pythius;</HI> nor pretend to be ignorant of my own Wealth; but being perfectly inform'd of the State of my Accompts, shall tell you the Truth with Sincerity. When I heard you was ready to begin the March towards the <HI>Grecian</HI> Sea, I resolv'd to present you with a Sum of Mo∣ney towards the Charge of the War; and to that end having taken an Account of my Riches, I found by Com∣putation that I had two thousand Talents of Silver, and three Millions nine hundred ninety three thousand Pieces of Gold, bearing the Stamp of <HI>Darius.</HI> These Treasures I freely give you, because I shall be sufficiently furnish'd with whatever is necessary to Life by the Labour of my Servants and Husbandmen.</P><P>"<HI>Xerxes</HI> heard these Words with Pleasure, and in answer to <HI>Pythius,</HI> said; My <HI>Lydian</HI> Host, since I parted from <HI>Susa</HI> I have not found a Man besides your self, who has offer'd to entertain my Army, or voluntarily to contribute his Treasures to promote the present Expedition. You a∣lone have treated my Army magnificently, and readily of∣fer'd me immense Riches: Therefore, in Return of your Kindness, I make you my Host; and that you may be Master of the intire Sum of four Millions in Gold, I will give you seven thousand <HI>Darian</HI> Pieces out of my own Treasure.

if you know how to continue always in the same good Disposition, you shall never have reason to repent of your Affection to me, either now or in future time.</P></Q></P>
<P>The Sum here offer'd by <HI>Pythius</HI> amounts by <HI>Brerewood</HI>'s Computation to three Millions three hundred seventy five thou∣sand Pounds Sterling, according to the lesser Valuation of Ta∣lents.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 107. <HI>Thou</HI> Hector <HI>to the Town.</HI>]</Q> It has been a mo∣dern Objection to <HI>Homer</HI>'s Conduct, that <HI>Hector</HI> upon whom the whole Fate of the Day depended, is made to retire from the Battel, only to carry a Message to <HI>Troy</HI> concerning a Sacrifice, which might have been done as well by any o∣ther. They think it absurd in <HI>Helenus</HI> to advise this, and in <HI>Hector</HI> to comply with it. What occasion'd this false Criti∣cism was that they imagin'd it to be a Piece of <HI>Advice,</HI> and not a <HI>Command. Helenus</HI> was a Priest and Augur of the highest Rank, he enjoins it as a Point of Religion, and <HI>Hector</HI> obeys him as one inspired from Heaven. The <HI>Trojan</HI> Army was in the utmost Distress, occasion'd by the prodigious Slaughter made by <HI>Diomed:</HI> There was therefore more Reason and Ne∣cessity to propitiate <HI>Minerva</HI> who assisted that Hero; which <HI>He∣lenus</HI> might know, tho' <HI>Hector</HI> would have chosen to have stay'd and trusted to the Arm of Flesh. Here is nothing but what may agree with each of their Characters. <HI>Hector</HI> goes as he was obliged in Religion, but not before he has animated the Troops, re-established the Combate, repulsed the <HI>Greeks</HI> to some distance, received a Promise from <HI>Helenus</HI> that they would make a stand at the Gates, and given one himself to the Army that he would soon return to the Fight: All which <HI>Homer</HI> has been careful to specify, to save the Honour and preserve the Character of this Hero. As to <HI>Helenus</HI> his
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
Part, he saw the Straits his Countrymen were reduced to, he knew his Authority as a Priest, and design'd to revive the Courage of the Troops by a Promise of divine Assistance. Nothing adds more Courage to the Minds of Men than Su∣perstition, and perhaps it was the only Expedient then left; much like a modern Practice in the Army, to enjoin a <HI>Fast</HI> when they wanted Provision. <HI>Helenus</HI> could no way have made his Promise more credible, than by sending a∣way <HI>Hector;</HI> which look'd like an Assurance that nothing could prejudice them during his Absence on such a religious Account. No Leader of less Authority than <HI>Hector</HI> could so properly have enjoin'd this solemn Act of Religion; and lastly, no other whose Valour was less known than his, could have left the Army in this Juncture without a Taint upon his Honour. <HI>Homer</HI> makes this Piety succeed; <HI>Paris</HI> is brought back to the Fight, the <HI>Trojans</HI> afterwards prevail, and <HI>Jupi∣ter</HI> appears openly in their favour, <HI>l.</HI> 8. Tho' after all, I can∣not dissemble my Opinion, that the Poet's chief Intention in this, was to introduce that fine Episode of the Parting of <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Andromache.</HI> This Change of the Scene to <HI>Troy</HI> furnishes him with a great Number of Beauties. <HI>By this means</HI> (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) <HI>his Poem is for a time divested of the Fierceness and Violence of Battels, and being as it were wash'd from Slaughter and Blood, becomes calm and smiling by the Beauty of these various Episodes.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 147. <HI>The Interview of</HI> Glaucus <HI>and</HI> Diomed.]</Q> No Passage in our Author has been the Subject of more severe and groundless Criticisms than this, where these two Heroes enter into a long Conversation (as they will have it) in the Heat of a Battel. Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Answer in Defence of <HI>Homer</HI> is so full, that I cannot do better than to translate it from his Remarks on the 26<HI>th</HI> Chapter of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Poetic.</HI> There can be nothing more unjust than the Criticisms past upon things that are the Effect of Custom. It was usual in ancient Times for Soldiers to talk together be∣fore they encounter'd. <HI>Homer</HI> is full of Examples of this sort, and he very well deserves we should be so just as to believe, he had never done it so often, but that it was agreeable to the Manners of his Age. But this is not only a thing of Custom, but founded in Reason itself. The Ties of Hospitality in those Times were held more sacred than those of Blood; and it is on that Account <HI>Diomed</HI> gives so long an Audience to <HI>Glaucus,</HI> whom he acknowledges to be his Guest, with whom it was not lawful to engage in Com∣bate. <HI>Homer</HI> makes an admirable Use of this Conjuncture, to introduce an entertaining History after so many Battels as he has been describing, and to unbend the Mind of his Rea∣der by a Recital of so much Variety as the Story of the Family of <HI>Sisyphus.</HI> It may be farther observ'd, with what
<PB N="159" REF="159"/>
Address and Management he places this long Conversation; it is not during the Heat of an obstinate Battel, which had been too unseasonable to be excused by any Custom what∣ever; but he brings it in after he has made <HI>Hector</HI> re∣tire into <HI>Troy,</HI> when the Absence of so powerful an Enemy had given <HI>Diomed</HI> that Leisure which he could not have had otherwise. One need only read the judicious Remark of <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI> upon this Place. <HI>The Poet</HI> (says he) <HI>after having caus'd</HI> Hector <HI>to go out of the Fight, interrupts the Violence of Wars, and gives some Relaxation to the Reader, in causing him to pass from the Confusion and Disorder of the Action to the Tranquillity and Security of an Historical Narration. For by means of the happy Episode of</HI> Glaucus, <HI>he casts a thousand pleasing Wonders into his Poem; as Fables, that include beau∣tiful Allegories, Histories, Genealogies, Sentences, ancient Cu∣stoms, and several other Graces that tend to the diversifying of his Work, and which by breaking (as one may say) the Mono∣tomy of it, agreeably instruct the Reader.</HI> Let us observe, in how fine a manner <HI>Homer</HI> has hereby praised both <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Hector.</HI> For he makes us know, that as long as <HI>Hector</HI> is in the Field, the <HI>Greeks</HI> have not the least Leisure to take breath; and that as soon as he quits it, all the <HI>Trojans,</HI> how∣ever they had regain'd all their Advantages, were not able to employ <HI>Diomed</HI> so far as to prevent his entertaining him∣self with <HI>Glaucus</HI> without any danger to his Party. Some may think after all, that tho' we may justify <HI>Homer,</HI> we cannot excuse the Manners of his Time; it not being natu∣ral for Men with Swords in their Hands to dialogue together in cold Blood just before they engage. But not to alledge, that these very Manners yet remain in those Countries, which have not been corrupted by the Commerce of other Nati∣ons, (which is a great Sign of their being natural) what Rea∣son can be offer'd that it is more natural to fall on at first Sight with Rage and Fierceness, than to speak to an E∣nemy before the Encounter? Thus far Monsieur <HI>Dacier,</HI> and St. <HI>Evremont</HI> asks humourously, if it might not be as pro∣per in that Country for Men to harangue before they fought, as it is in <HI>England</HI> to make Speeches before they are hanged.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160"/>
That <HI>Homer</HI> is not in general apt to make unseasonable Harangues (as these Censurers would represent) may appear from that remarkable Care he has shewn in many Places to avoid them: As when in the fifth Book <HI>Aeneas</HI> being cured on a sudden in the middle of the Fight, is seen with Sur∣prize by his Soldiers; he specifies with particular Caution, that they <HI>asked him no Questions how he became cured,</HI> in a time of so much Business and Action. Again, when there is a Necessity in the same Book that <HI>Minerva</HI> should have a Con∣ference with <HI>Diomed,</HI> in order to engage him against <HI>Mars</HI> (after her Prohibition to him to fight with the Gods) <HI>Homer</HI> chuses a time for that Speech, just when the Hero is retir'd behind his Chariot to take Breath, which was the only Mo∣ment that could be spared during the Hurry of that whole Engagement. One might produce many Instances of the same kind.</P>
<P>The Discourse of <HI>Glaucus</HI> to <HI>Diomed</HI> is severely censured, not only on Account of the Circumstance of Time and Place, but likewise on the Score of the Subject, which is taxed as improper, and foreign to the End and Design of the Poem. But the Criticks who have made this Objection, seem neither to comprehend the Design of the Poet in general, nor the particular Aim of this Discourse. Many Passages in the best ancient Poets appear unaffecting at present, which probably gave the greatest Delight to their first Readers, because they were nearly interested in what was there related. It is very plain that <HI>Homer</HI> designed this Poem as a Monument to the Honour of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who, tho' consisting of several inde∣pendent Societies, were yet very national in Point of Glory, being strongly affected with every thing that seem'd to ad∣vance the Honour of their common Country, and resentful of any Indignity offer'd to it. This Disposition was the Ground of that grand Alliance which is the Subject of this Poem. To Men so fond of their Country's Glory, what could be more agreeable than to read a History fill'd with Wonders of a noble Family transplanted from <HI>Greece</HI> into <HI>Asia?</HI> They might here learn with Pleasure that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Virtues did not degenerate by removing into distant Climes: but especial∣ly they must be affected with uncommon Delight to find that

<HI>Sarpedon</HI> and <HI>Glaucus,</HI> the bravest of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Auxiliaries, were originally <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 524. <HI>The fierce</HI> Achilles, &amp;c.]</Q> Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> in the Pre∣face to the third Volume of <HI>Miscellany Poems</HI> has past a Judgment upon Part of this Speech which is altogether unworthy of him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Andromache</HI> (says he) in the midst of her Concernment and Fright for <HI>Hector,</HI> runs off her Biass, to tell him a Story

of her Pedigree, and of the lamentable Death of her Fa∣ther, her Mother, and her seven Brothers. The Devil was in <HI>Hector,</HI> if he knew not all this Matter, as well as she who told it him; for she had been his Bedfellow for many Years together: and if he knew it, then it must be confess'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> in this long Digression, has rather given us his own Character, than that of the fair Lady whom he paints. His dear Friends the Commentators, who never fail him at a Pinch, will needs excuse him, by making the present Sorrow of <HI>Andromache,</HI> to occasion the Remembrance of all the past: But others think that she had enough to do with that Grief which now oppress'd her, without running for Assistance to her Family."</Q> But may not it be answer'd, that nothing was more natural in <HI>Andromache,</HI> than to recollect her past Calamities in order to represent her present Distress to <HI>Hector</HI> in a stronger Light, and shew her utter Desertion if he should perish. What could more effectually work upon a generous and tender Mind like that of <HI>Hector?</HI> What could therefore be more proper to each of their Characters? If <HI>Hector</HI> be induced to refrain from the Field, it proceeds from Compassion to <HI>Andromache:</HI> If <HI>Andromache</HI> endeavour to persuade him, it proceeds from her Fear for the Life of <HI>Hector. Homer</HI> had yet a farther View in this Recapitulation; it tends to raise his chief Hero <HI>Achil∣les,</HI> and acquaints us with those great Atchievements of his which preceded the Opening of the Poem. Since there was a Necessity that this Hero should be absent from the Action during a great Part of the Iliad, the Poet has shewn his Art in nothing more, than the Methods he takes from time to time to keep up our great Idea of him, and to awaken our Expectation of what he is to perform in the Progress of the Work. His greatest Enemies cannot upbraid or complain of him, but at the same time they confess his Glory and de∣scribe his Victories. When <HI>Apollo</HI> encourages the <HI>Trojans</HI> to fight, it is by telling them <HI>Achilles</HI> fights no more. When <HI>Juno</HI> animates the <HI>Greeks,</HI> it is by putting them in mind that they have to do with Enemies who durst not appear out of their Walls while <HI>Achilles</HI> engaged. When <HI>Andromache</HI> trem∣bles for <HI>Hector,</HI> it is with Remembrance of the resistless Force
<PB N="177" REF="177"/>
of <HI>Achilles.</HI> And when <HI>Agamemnon</HI> would bribe him to a Re∣conciliation, it is partly with those very Treasures and Spoils which had been won by <HI>Achilles</HI> himself.</P>

All these are but small Circumstances, but so artfully chosen, that every Reader immediately feels the force of them, and represents the whole in the utmost Liveliness to his Imagina∣tion. This alone might be a Confutation of that false Cri∣ticism some have fallen into, who affirm that a Poet ought only to collect the great and noble Particulars in his Paint∣ings. But it is in the Images of Things as in the Characters of Persons; where a small Action, or even a small Circum∣stance of an Action, lets us more into the Knowledge and Comprehension of them, than the material and principal Parts themselves. As we find this in a History, so we do in a Picture, where sometimes a small Motion or Turning of a Finger will express the Character and Action of the Figure more than all the other Parts of the Design. <HI>Longinus</HI> in∣deed blames an Author's insisting too much on trivial Cir∣cumstances; but in the same Place extols <HI>Homer</HI> as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Poet who best knew how to make use of important and beautiful Circumstances, and to avoid the mean and superfluous ones."</Q> There is a vast difference betwixt a <HI>small</HI> Circumstance and a <HI>trivial</HI> one, and the smallest become important if they are well chosen, and not confused.</P>

But perhaps this Remark is too refined, since <HI>Homer</HI> plainly gives <HI>Paris</HI> a Character of Bravery in what immediately precedes and follows this Verse.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 23. <HI>When now</HI> Minerva, &amp;c.]</Q> This Machine of the two Deities meeting to part the Armies is very noble. <HI>Eustathius</HI> tells us it is an allegorical <HI>Minerva</HI> and <HI>Apollo: Minerva</HI> represents the prudent Valour of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> who stood for the <HI>Trojans,</HI> the Power of Destiny: So that the Meaning of the Allegory may be, that the Valour and Wisdom of the <HI>Greeks</HI> had now conquer'd <HI>Troy,</HI> had not Destiny withstood. <HI>Minerva</HI> therefore complies with <HI>Apollo,</HI> an Intimation that Wisdom can never oppose Fate. But if you take them in the literal Sense as a real God and Goddess, it may be ask'd what Necessity there was for the Introduction of two such Deities? To this <HI>Eustathius</HI> answers, that the last Book was the only one in which both Armies were destitute of the Aid of the Gods: In Consequence of which there is no gallant Action atchiev'd, nothing extraordinary done, e∣specially after the Retreat of <HI>Hector;</HI> but here the Gods are again introduced to usher in a new Scene of great Actions. The same Author offers this other Solution: <HI>Hector</HI> finding the <HI>Trojan</HI> Army overpower'd, considers how to stop the Fu∣ry of rhe present Battel; this he thinks may best be done by the Proposal of a single Combate: Thus <HI>Minerva</HI> by a very easy and natural Fiction may signify that Wisdom or Courage (she being the Goddess of both) which suggests the Necessity of diverting the War; and <HI>Apollo,</HI> that seasonable Stratagem by which he effected it.</P>

Or else being an <HI>Augur,</HI> he might learn it from the Flight of those Birds, into which the Deities are here feigned to transform themselves, (perhaps for that Reason, as it would be a very Poetical manner of expressing it.) The Fiction of these Divinities sitting on the Beech-Tree in the Shape of <HI>Vulturs,</HI> is imitated by <HI>Milton</HI> in the fourth Book of <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> where <HI>Satan</HI> leaping over the Boundaries of <HI>Eden</HI> sits in the Form of a Cormorant up∣on the Tree of Life.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 57. <HI>For not this Day shall end thy glorious Date.</HI>]</Q> <HI>Eustathius</HI> justly observes that <HI>Homer</HI> here takes from the Great∣ness of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Intrepidity, by making him foreknow that he should not fall in this Combate; whereas <HI>Ajax</HI> encounters him without any such Encouragement. It may perhaps be difficult to give a Reason for this Management of the Poet, unless we ascribe it to that commendable Prejudice, and ho∣nourable Partiality he bears his Countrymen, which makes him give a Superiority of Courage to the Heroes of his own Nation.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 60. <HI>Then with his Spear restrain'd the Youth of</HI> Troy, <HI>Held by the midst athwart.—</HI>]</Q> The Remark of <HI>Eustathius</HI> here is observable: He tells us that the Warriors of those Times (having no Trumpets, and because the Voice of the loudest Herald would be drown'd in the Noise of a Battel) address'd themselves to the Eyes, and that grasping the middle of the Spear denoted a Request that the Fight might a while be suspended; the holding the Spear in that Position not being the Posture of a Warrior; and thus <HI>Agamemnon</HI> understands it without any farther Explication. But however it be, we have a lively Pi∣cture of a General who stretches his Spear across, and presses back the most advanced Soldiers of his Army.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 71. <HI>As when a gen'ral Darkness,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> The thick Ranks of the Troops composing themselves, in order to sit and hear what <HI>Hector</HI> was about to propose, are compared to the Waves of the Sea that are just stirr'd by the <HI>West</HI> Wind; the Simile partly consisting in the Darkness and Stillness. This is plainly different from those Images of the Sea, given us on other Occasions, where the Armies in their Engagement and Confusion are compared to the Waves in their Agitation and Tumult: And that the contrary is the Drift of this Si∣mile appears particularly from <HI>Homer</HI>'s using the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>sedebant,</HI> twice in the Application of it. All the other Ver∣sions seem to be mistaken here: What caused the Difficulty was the Expression <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which may signify the <HI>West</HI> Wind <HI>blowing on a sudden,</HI> as well as <HI>first rising.</HI> But the Design of <HI>Homer</HI> was to convey an Image both of the gentle Motion that arose over the Field from the Helmets and Spears before their Armies were quite settled; and of the Repose and Awe which ensued, when <HI>Hector</HI> began to speak.</P>

<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 79. <HI>Hear all ye</HI> Trojan, <HI>all ye</HI> Grecian <HI>Bands.</HI>]</Q> The Appearance of <HI>Hector,</HI> his formal Challenge, and the Affright of the <HI>Greeks</HI> upon it, have a near Resemblance to the Description of the Challenge of <HI>Goliah</HI> in the first Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> Ch. 17. <Q REND="inline"><HI>And he stood and cried to the Armies of</HI> Israel<HI>—Chuse you a Man for you, and let him come down to me.

<P>There is a fine Air of Gallantry and Bravery in this Chal∣lenge of <HI>Hector.</HI> If he seems to speak too vainly, we should consider him under the Character of a Challenger, whose Bu∣siness it is to defy the Enemy. Yet at the same time we
<PB N="221" REF="218"/>
find a decent Modesty in his manner of expressing the Con∣ditions of the Combate: He says simply, <HI>If my Enemy kills me;</HI> but of himself, <HI>If</HI> Apollo <HI>grant me Victory.</HI> It was an Imagination equally agreeable to a Man of Ge∣nerosity and a Lover of Glory, to mention the Monument to be erected over his vanquish'd Enemy; tho' we see he considers it not so much an Honour paid to the Conquer'd as a Trophie to the Conqueror. It was natural too to dwell most upon the Thought that pleas'd him best, for he takes no notice of any Monument that should be raised over him∣self if he should fall unfortunately. He no sooner allows him∣self to expatiate, but the Prospect of Glory carries him away thus far beyond his first Intention, which was only to allow the Enemy liberty to inter their Champion with Decency.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 96. <HI>On</HI> Phoebus' <HI>Temple I'll his Arms bestow.</HI>]</Q> It was the Manner of the Ancients to dedicate Trophies of this kind to the Temples of the Gods.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 98.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 105. <HI>All</HI> Greece <HI>astonish'd heard.</HI>]</Q> It seems natural to enquire, why the <HI>Greeks,</HI> before they accepted <HI>Hector</HI>'s Challenge, did not demand Reparation for the former Trea∣chery of <HI>Pandarus,</HI> and insist upon delivering up the Author of it; which had been the shortest way for the <HI>Trojans</HI> to have wip'd off that Stain: It was very reasonable for the <HI>Greeks</HI> to reply to this Challenge, that they could not ven∣ture a second single Combate for fear of such another insidi∣ous Attempt upon their Champion. And indeed I wonder that <HI>Nestor</HI> did not think of this Excuse for his Countrymen, when they were so backward to engage. One may make some sort of answer to this, if we consider the Clearness of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Character, and his Words at the beginning of the foregoing Speech, where he first complains of the Revival of the War as a Misfortune common to them both (which is at once very artful and decent) and lays the blame of it upon <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Tho', by the way, his charging the <HI>Trojans</HI> Breach of Faith upon the Deity looks a little like the reasoning of some modern Saints in the Doctrine of absolute Reprobation, making God the Author of Sin, and may serve for some In∣stance of the Antiquity of that false Tenet.</P>

<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 131. <HI>Ev'n fierce</HI> Achilles <HI>learn'd his Force to fear.</HI>]</Q> The Poet every where takes occasion to set the brotherly Love of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> toward <HI>Menelaus</HI> in the most agreeable Light: When <HI>Menelaus</HI> is wounded, <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is more concern'd than He; and here dissuades him from a Dan∣ger, which he offers immediately after to undertake him∣self. He makes use of <HI>Hector</HI>'s superior Courage to bring him to a Compliance; and tells him that even <HI>Achilles</HI> dares not engage with <HI>Hector.</HI> This (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) is not true, but only the Affection for his Brother thus breaks out into a kind Extravagance. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> likewise consults the Honour of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> for it will be no Disgrace to him to decline encountering a Man whom <HI>Achilles</HI> himself is a∣fraid of.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 135. <HI>The mightiest Warrior,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> It cannot with Certainty be concluded from the Words of <HI>Homer,</HI> who is the Person to whom <HI>Agamemnon</HI> applies the last Lines of this Speech; the Interpreters leave it as undetermin'd in their Translations as it is in the Original. Some would have it understood of <HI>Hector,</HI> that the <HI>Greeks</HI> would send such an Antagonist against him, from whose Hands <HI>Hector</HI> might be glad to escape. But this Interpretation seems contrary to the plain Design of <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Discourse, which only aims to deter his Brother from so rash an Undertaking as engaging with <HI>Hector.</HI> So that instead of dropping any Expression which might depreciate the Power or Courage of this Hero, he endeavours rather to represent him as the most formida∣ble of Men, and dreadful even to <HI>Achilles.</HI> This Passage therefore will be most consistent with <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Design, if it be consider'd as an Argument offer'd to <HI>Menelaus,</HI> at once
<PB N="224" REF="221"/>
to dissuade him from the Engagement, and to comfort him under the Appearance of so great a Disgrace as refusing the Challenge; by telling him that any Warrior, how bold and intrepid soever, might be content to sit still and rejoice that he is not expos'd to so hazardous an Engagement.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 145. <HI>The Speech of</HI> Nestor.]</Q> This Speech, if we consider the Occasion of it, could be made by no Person but <HI>Nestor.</HI> No young Warrior could with Decency exhort others to undertake a Combate which himself declin'd. Nothing could be more in his Character than to represent to the <HI>Greeks</HI> how much they would suffer in the Opinion of another old Man like himself. In naming <HI>Peleus</HI> he sets before their Eyes the Expectations of all their Fathers, and the Shame that must afflict them in their old Age if their Sons behaved themselves unworthily. The Account he gives of the Con∣versations he had formerly held with that King, and his Jea∣lousy for the Glory of <HI>Greece,</HI> is a very natural Picture of the warm Dialogues of two old Warriors upon the Commence∣ment of a new War. Upon the whole, <HI>Nestor</HI> never more displays his Oratory than in this Place: You see him rising with a Sigh, expressing a pathetick Sorrow, and wishing again for his Youth that he might wipe away this Disgrace from his Country. The Humour of Story-telling, so natural to old Men, is almost always mark'd by <HI>Homer</HI> in the Speeches of <HI>Nestor.</HI> The Apprehension that their Age makes them con∣temptible, puts them upon repeating the brave Deeds of their

Youth. <HI>Plutarch</HI> justifies the Praises <HI>Nestor</HI> here gives him∣self, and the Vaunts of his Valour, which on this Occasion were only Exhortations to those he address'd them to: By these he restores Courage to the <HI>Greeks</HI> who were astonish'd at the bold Challenge of <HI>Hector,</HI> and causes nine of the Prin∣ces to rise and accept it. If any Man had a right to com∣mend himself, it was this venerable Prince, who in relating his own Actions did no more than propose Examples of Vir∣tue to the Young. <HI>Virgil,</HI> without any such softening Qua∣lification, makes his Hero say of himself,<Q><L>Sum pius Aeneas, fama super aethera notus.</L></Q> And comfort a dying Warrior with these Words,<Q><L>Aeneae magni dextra cadis.—</L></Q> The same Author also imitates the Wish of <HI>Nestor</HI> for a Re∣turn of his Youth, where <HI>Evander</HI> cries out,<Q><L>O mihi praeteritos referat si Jupiter annos!</L>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 226. <HI>Warriors! I claim the Lot.</HI>]</Q> This is the first Speech of <HI>Ajax</HI> in the Iliad. He is no Orator, but always expresses himself in short, generally bragging, or threatning, and very positive. The Appellation of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>Bul∣wark of the</HI> Greeks, which <HI>Homer</HI> almost constantly gives him, is extremely proper to the Bulk, Strength, and Immobility of this heavy Hero, who on all Occasions is made to stand to the Business, and support the Brunt. These Qualificati∣ons are given him, that he may last out, when the rest of the chief Heroes are wounded. This makes him of excellent Use in Iliad 13, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He there puts a Stop to the whole Force of the Enemy, and a long time prevents the firing of the Ships. It is particularly observable that he is never as∣sisted by any Deity as the others are. Yet one would think <HI>Mars</HI> had been no improper Patron for him, there being some Resemblance in the boisterous Character of that God and this Hero. However it be, this Consideration may part∣ly account for a Particular which else might very well raise a Question: Why <HI>Ajax,</HI> who is in this Book superior in Strength to <HI>Hector,</HI> should afterward in the Iliad shun to meet him, and appear his Inferior? We see the Gods make this diffe∣rence: <HI>Hector</HI> is not only assisted by them in his own Per∣son, but his Men second him, whereas those of <HI>Ajax</HI> are di∣spirited by Heaven: To which one may add another which is a natural Reason, <HI>Hector</HI> in this Book expresly tells <HI>Ajax</HI> he will now make use of no Skill or Art in Fighting with him.

therefore serve to raise the Glory of his principal Hero, since they become necessary as soon as he withdraws his Aid. She might have added, that <HI>Achilles</HI> himself says all this, and makes <HI>Homer</HI>'s Apology in the ninth Book, ℣. 349. The same Author, speaking of this Fortification, seems to doubt whether the Use of intrenching Camps was known in the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, and is rather inclined to think <HI>Homer</HI> borrowed it from what was practised in his own Time. But I believe if we consider the Caution with which he has been observed, in some Instances already given, to preserve the Manners of the Age he writes of, in Contradistinction to what was practised in his own; we may reasonably conclude the Art of Fortification was in use even so long before him, and in the Degree of Perfection that he here describes it. If it was not, and if <HI>Homer</HI> was fond of describing an Improve∣ment in this Art made in his own Days, nothing could be better contrived than his feigning <HI>Nestor</HI> to be the Author of it, whose Wisdom and Experience in War render'd it probable that he might carry his Projects farther than the rest of his Contemporaries. We have here a Fortification as perfect as any in the modern Times.

He takes care at the first mention of it to fix in us a great Idea of this Work, by making the Gods immediately concern'd about it. We see <HI>Neptune</HI> jealous lest the Glory of his own Work, the Walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> should be effaced by it; and <HI>Jupiter</HI> comfor∣ting him with a Prophecy that it shall be totally destroy'd in a short time. <HI>Homer</HI> was sensible that as this was a Building

Therefore (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> observes) he has found this way to elude the Censure of an improbable Fiction: The Word of <HI>Jove</HI> was fulfilled, the Hands of the Gods, the Force of the Rivers, and the Waves of the Sea demolish'd it. In the twelfth Book he digresses from the Subject of his Po∣em to describe the Execution of this Prophecy.

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HOMER,</HI> like most of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> is thought to have travell'd into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and brought from the Priests there not only their Learning, but their manner of conveying it in Fables and Hiero∣glyphicks. This is necessary to be consider'd by those who would thoroughly penetrate into the Beauty and De∣sign of many Parts of this Author. For whoever reflects that this was the Mode of Learning in those Times, will make no doubt but there are several Mysteries both of Natural and Moral Philosophy involv'd in his Ficti∣ons, which otherwise in the literal Meaning appear too tri∣vial or irrational; and it is but just, when these are not plain or immediately intelligible, to imagine that something of this kind may be hid under them. Nevertheless, as <HI>Homer</HI> tra∣vell'd not with a direct View of writing Philosophy or Theo∣logy, so he might often use these Hieroglyphical Fables and Traditions as Embellishments of his Poetry only, without taking the Pains to open their mystical Meaning to his Rea∣ders, and perhaps without diving very deeply into it himself.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 25. <HI>Let down our golden everlasting Chain.</HI>]</Q> The various Opinions of the Ancients concerning this Passage are
<PB N="282" REF="276"/>
collected by <HI>Eustathius. Jupiter</HI> says, <HI>If he holds this Chain of Gold, the Force of all the Gods is unable to draw him down, but</HI> that <HI>he can draw up them, the Seas, and the Earth, and cause the whole Universe to hang unactive.</HI> Some think that <HI>Jupiter</HI> signifies the <HI>Aether,</HI> the golden Chain the <HI>Sun:</HI> If the <HI>Aether</HI> did not temper the Rays of the Sun as they pass thro' it, his Beams would not only drink up and exhale the Ocean in Vapours, but also exhale the Moisture from the Veins of the Earth, which is the Cement that holds it toge∣ther; by which means the whole Creation would become un∣active, and all its Powers be suspended.</P>
<P>Others affirm, that by this golden Chain may be meant the Days of the World's Duration, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which are as it were painted by the Lustre of the Sun, and follow one another in a successive Chain till they arrive at their final Pe∣riod: While <HI>Jupiter</HI> or the <HI>Aether</HI> (which the Ancients call'd the Soul of all Things) still remains unchanged.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Theaetetus</HI> says that by this golden Chain is meant the Sun, whose Rays enliven all Nature and cement the Parts of the Universe.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stoicks</HI> will have it that by <HI>Jupiter</HI> is implied Desti∣ny, which over-rules every thing both upon, and above the Earth.</P>
<P>Others (delighted with their own Conceits) imagine that <HI>Homer</HI> intended to represent the Excellence of Monarchy; that the Sceptre ought to be sway'd by one Hand, and that all the Wheels of Government should be put in Motion by one Person.</P>
<P>But I fancy a much better Interpretation may be found for this, if we allow (as there is great Reason to believe) that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> understood the true System of the World, and that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> first learn'd it from them. They held that the Planets were kept in their Orbits by Gravitation upon the Sun, which was therefore called <HI>Jovis carcer;</HI> and sometimes by the Sun (as <HI>Macrobius</HI> informs us) is meant <HI>Jupiter</HI> him∣self: We see too that the most prevailing Opinion of Anti∣quity fixes it to the <HI>Sun;</HI> so that I think it will be no strained Interpretation to say, that by the Inability of the Gods to pull <HI>Jupiter</HI> out of his Place with this <HI>Catena,</HI> may be un∣derstood

<L>Parcarumque dies &amp; vis inimica propinquat.</L></Q> So that there was less reason for weighing his Fate with that of <HI>Aeneas</HI> after that Declaration. <HI>Scaliger</HI> trifles miserably when he says <HI>Juno</HI> might have learn'd this from the Fates, tho' <HI>Jupiter</HI> did not know it, before he consulted them by weighing the Scales.

<PB N="289" REF="283"/>
to the Nature of the Sovereign Being, as representing him variable or inconstant in his Rewards and Punishments. It may be answer'd, that as God makes use of some People to chastise others, and none are totally void of Crimes, he often decrees to punish those very Persons for lesser Sins, whom he makes his Instruments to punish others for greater: so pur∣ging them from their own Iniquities before they become wor∣thy to be Chastisers of other Men's. This is the Case of the <HI>Greeks</HI> here, whom <HI>Jupiter</HI> permits to suffer many ways, tho' he had destin'd them to revenge the Rape of <HI>Helen</HI> upon <HI>Troy.</HI> There is a History in the Bible just of this Nature. In the 20<HI>th</HI> Chapter of <HI>Judges,</HI> the <HI>Israelites</HI> are commanded to make War against the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> to punish a Rape on the Wife of a <HI>Levite</HI> committed in the City of <HI>Gibeah:</HI> When they have laid Siege to the Place, the <HI>Benjamites</HI> sal∣ly upon them with so much Vigour, that a great Number of the Besiegers are destroy'd; they are astonish'd at these De∣feats, as having undertaken the Siege in Obedience to the Command of God: But they are still order'd to persist, till at length they burn the City, and almost extinguish the Race of <HI>Benjamin.</HI> There are many Instances in Scripture, where Heaven is represented to change its Decrees according to the Repentance or Relapses of Men: <HI>Hezechias</HI> is order'd to pre∣pare for Death, and afterwards fifteen Years are added to his Life: It is foretold to <HI>Achab</HI> that he shall perish miserably, and then upon his Humiliation God defers the Punishment till the Reign of his Successor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess, that in comparing Passages of the sacred Books with our Author one ought to use a great deal of Cau∣tion and Respect. If there are some Places in Scripture that in Compliance to human Understanding represent the Deity as acting by Motives like those of Men; there are infinitely more that shew him as he is, all Perfection, Justice, and Be∣neficence; whereas in <HI>Homer</HI> the general Tenor of the Po∣em represents <HI>Jupiter</HI> as a Being subject to Passion, Inequa∣lity, and Imperfection.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 406. <HI>As the bold Hound that gives the Lion chace.</HI>]</Q> This Simile is the justest imaginable; and gives the most lively Picture of the manner in which the <HI>Grecians</HI> fled, and <HI>Hector</HI> pursued them, still slaughtering the hindmost. <HI>Gra∣tius</HI> and <HI>Oppian</HI> have given us particular Descriptions of those sort of Dogs, of prodigious Strength and Size, which were employ'd to hunt and tear down wild Beasts. To one of these fierce Animals he compares <HI>Hector,</HI> and one cannot but observe his Care not to disgrace his <HI>Grecian</HI> Countrymen by an unworthy Comparison: Tho' he is obliged to represent them flying, he makes them fly like Lions, and as they fly, turn frequently back upon their Pursuer; so that it is hard to say if they, or he, be in the greater Danger. On the contra∣ry, when any of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Heroes pursue the <HI>Trojans,</HI> it is He that is the Lion, and the Flyers are but Sheep or trem∣bling Deer.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 438. <HI>The stubborn God, inflexible and hard.</HI>]</Q> It must be owned that this Speech of <HI>Minerva</HI> against <HI>Jupiter,</HI> shocks the Allegory more than perhaps any in the Poem. Unless the Deities may sometimes be thought to mean no more than Beings that presided over those Parts of Nature, or those Passions and Faculties of the Mind. Thus as <HI>Venus</HI> suggests unlawful as well as lawful Desires, so <HI>Minerva</HI> may be described as the Goddess not only of Wisdom but of Craft, that is, both of true and false Wisdom. So the Moral of <HI>Minerva</HI>'s speaking rashly of <HI>Jupiter</HI> may be, that the wisest of finite Beings is liable to Passion and Indiscretion, as the Commentators have already observ'd.</P>

<P>Her Behaviour in this Place is very natural to a Person un∣der a Disappointment: She had set her Heart upon preferring the <HI>Greeks,</HI> but failing in that Point, she assumes an Air of Indifference, and says, whether they live or die, she is uncon∣cern'd.</P>

<P><HI>Juno</HI> here repeats the same Words which had been us'd by
<PB N="303" REF="297"/>
<HI>Minerva</HI> to <HI>Jupiter</HI> near the beginning of this Book. What is there utter'd by Wisdom herself, and approv'd by him, is here spoken by a Goddess who (as <HI>Homer</HI> tells us at this very time) imprudently manifested her Passion, and whom <HI>Jupiter</HI> answers with Anger. To deal fairly, I cannot de∣fend this in my Author, any more than some other of his Repetitions; as when <HI>Ajax</HI> in the fifteenth Iliad, ℣. 561. uses the same Speech word for word to encourage the <HI>Greeks,</HI> which <HI>Agamemnon</HI> had made in the fifth, ℣. 529. I think it equally an Extreme, to vindicate all the Repetitions of <HI>Homer,</HI> and to excuse none. However <HI>Eustathius</HI> very ingeniously excuses this, by saying that the same Speeches become entirely dif∣ferent by the different manner of introducing them. <HI>Mi∣nerva</HI> address'd herself to <HI>Jupiter</HI> with Words full of Respect, but <HI>Juno</HI> with Terms of Resentment. This, says he, shews the Effect of opening our Speeches with Art: It prejudices the Audience in our favour, and makes us speak to Friends: whereas the Auditor naturally denies that Favour, which the Orator does not seem to ask; so that what he delivers, tho' it has equal Merit, labours under this Disadvantage, that his Judges are his Enemies.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 702. <HI>A thousand Piles.</HI>]</Q> <HI>Homer</HI> in his Catalogue of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Ships, tho' he does not recount expresly the Number of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> has given some Hints from whence the Sum of their Army may be collected. But in the same Book where he gives an Account of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Army, and relates the Names of the Leaders and Nations of the Auxili∣aries, he says nothing by which we may infer the Number of the Army of the besieged. To supply therefore that Omis∣sion, he has taken occasion by this Piece of Poetical Arith∣metick, to inform his Reader, that the <HI>Trojan</HI> Army amounted to fifty thousand. That the Assistant Nations are to be inclu∣ded herein, appears from what <HI>Dolon</HI> says in <HI>l.</HI> 10. that the Auxiliaries were encamped that Night with the <HI>Trojans.</HI></P>
<P>This Passage gives me occasion to animadvert upon a Mistake of a modern Writer, and another of my own. The <HI>Abbè Terasson</HI> in a late Treatise against <HI>Homer,</HI> is under a grievous Error, in saying that all the Forces of <HI>Troy</HI> and the Auxiliaries cannot be reasonably suppos'd from <HI>Homer</HI> to be above ten thousand Men. He had entirely overlook'd this Place, which says there were a thousand Fires, and fifty Men at each of them.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 706. <HI>The Coursers o'er their Heaps of Corn.</HI>]</Q> I durst not take the same Liberty with M. <HI>Dacier,</HI> who has omitted this Circumstance, and does not mention the Horses at all. In the following Line, the last of the Book, <HI>Homer</HI> has gi∣ven to the <HI>Morning</HI> the Epithet <HI>fair-haired,</HI> or <HI>bright-throned,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. I have already taken notice in the Preface of the Method of translating the Epithets of <HI>Homer,</HI> and must add here, that it is often only the Uncertainty the Mo∣derns lie under, of the true genuine Signification of an
<PB N="306" REF="300"/>
ancient word, which causes the many various Constructions of it. So that it is probable the Author's own Words, at the time he used them, never meant half so many things as we translate them into. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> generally observes one Practice as to these throughout her Version: She ren∣ders almost every such Epithet in <HI>Greek</HI> by two or three in <HI>French,</HI> from a fear of losing the least part of its Signifi∣cance. This perhaps may be excusable in Prose; tho' at best it makes the whole much more verbose and tedious, and is rather like writing a Dictionary than rendring an Author: But in Verse, every Reader knows such a Redoubling of Epi∣thets would not be tolerable. A Poet has therefore only to chuse that, which most agrees with the Tenor and main In∣tent of the particular Passage, or with the Genius of Poetry itself.</P>
<P>It is plain that too scrupulous an Adherence to many of these, gives the Translation an exotic, pedantic, and whimsical Air, which it is not to be imagined the Original ever had. To call a Hero the <HI>great Artificer of Flight,</HI> the <HI>swift of Foot,</HI> or the <HI>Horse-tamer,</HI> these give us Ideas of little Pecu∣liarities, when in the Author's Time they were Epithets used only in general to signify Alacrity, Agility, and Vigor. A common Reader would imagine from these servile Versions, that <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> were Foot-Racers, and <HI>Hector</HI> a Horse-Courser, rather than that any of them were Heroes. A Man shall be call'd a faithful Translator for rendring <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in <HI>English, swift-footed;</HI> but laugh'd at if he should translate our <HI>English</HI> word <HI>dext'rous</HI> into any other Language, <HI>right-handed.</HI></P>
