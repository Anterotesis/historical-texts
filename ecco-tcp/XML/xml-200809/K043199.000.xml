<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE unrelenting opposition which the productions of the author of the present comedy have experienced for several years is well known, to those who pay attention to our public amuse∣ments. It is not for him to pronounce how far this opposition has been merited by inability. Since the appearance of The Road to Ruin, his comedy of The Deserted Daughter only has escaped; and that, as he imagines, because it was not known on the night of its first performance by whom it was written. Love's Frailties, The Man of Ten Thousand, and Knave or Not? have sustained increasing marks of hostility: so that the efforts made to afford rational amusement to the public, emolument to the author, and improvement to morals, have been ren∣dered feeble and almost ineffectual. In the last instance, one mistake appears to have pervaded the majority of the spectators. It was imagined that the author himself was as unqualified a libeller of mankind as Monrose: in which character the writer's individual sentiments were supposed to have been incorporated. Those who have read his other works surely cannot attribute to him any such indiscriminate misanthropy. The accusation that has most generally been made against him is that he thinks men capable of gradations of virtue, which others affirm they can never attain. Persons, who have made the human mind their study, have discovered that guilty men exert the whole force of their facul∣ties to justify their own course of action to themselves. To this principle the writer was strictly attentive, in pourtraying the character of Monrose. His design was to draw a man of genius, misled by his passions, reasoning on his actions, systematizing them, condemning them in principle, but justifying them in practice, and heating his imagination by contemplating the crimes of others; that he might still maintain that respect for himself of which the strongest minds, even in the last stages of vice, are so tenacious. How far that spirit of faction, commo∣tion, and anarchy, of which the author has long been and is still so vehemently accused, is to be traced in the present co∣medy may now be seen. Sincerely desirous of giving no of∣fence, the passages which were most disapproved, or to speak more accurately reprobated, on the first night, have since been omitted in representation: but they are printed between in∣verted
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
commas; that the cool judgment may decide whether the author could have been so insane as actually to intend to en∣flame the spectators, and increase a spirit of enmity between men of different sentiments: whom, could he reconcile, he would ac∣count it the most beneficial and heart consoling action of his life. The seventh scene in the fourth act is likewise omitted, in the performance: because, instead of giving pleasure, it appeared tedious. It is inserted here rather to preserve a necessary con∣nection between the scenes, than to appeal from the judgment and the feelings of a whole audience.</P>
<P>Before the comedy appeared, all parties were anxious that no sentence or word should be spoken, which could be liable to misrepresentation. Some few passages, therefore, are commit∣ted to the press, which never were spoken on the Stage: par∣ticularly the concluding part of the last speech in the second act, where Monrose enquires into his qualifications for being a lord. A few years ago, this would have been common-place satire: and it is a subject of no little regret that, at present, lo∣cal and temporary applications are so liable to be made where none are intended.</P>
<P>Truth requires it should be mentioned that, in the original sketch of this comedy, some hints were taken from IL RAG∣GIRATORE, LA SERVA AMOROSA, and IL PADRE DI FAMI∣GLIA, by GOLDONI: but of these, though he has not lately examined them, the author is persuaded so few traces remain that they are scarcely discoverable. They are mentioned, be∣cause he considers the least concealment of such a kind as de∣rogatory to that veracity which it is the peculiar duty of moral writers to inculcate.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AMONG the various ways by wit devis'd,</L>
<L>To paint our faults and follies, undisguis'd,</L>
<L>Through every age is found of most avail</L>
<L>The well drawn character, and well told tale.</L>
<L>Hence has the Stage become the last resort</L>
<L>Of injured Innocence: her proper court.</L>
<L>"The guilty wretch," whom power and gold can screen,</L>
<L>"Struck to the soul," will sicken at the scene.</L>
<L>Vice that, with front erect and brazen eye,</L>
<L>In broad day pomp will pass unblushing by,</L>
<L>Should he be seen but "sitting at a play,"</L>
<L>How will his secret sins that conscious eye betray!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pert Folly too, caprice in every freak,</L>
<L>Displays her feather'd head, and painted cheek;</L>
<L>While, "louder far than Wisdom in the street,"</L>
<L>She cries—"Lo! Here am I! Come, worship at my feet!"</L>
<L>The thoughtless crowd, thus summon'd to adore her,</L>
<L>Hear, stare, obey, and prostrate fall before her.</L>
<L>Yet let her be in all her frippery caught,</L>
<L>Just as she shews herself, and hither brought,</L>
<L>The moment here she's seen the witless elves</L>
<L>Laugh at their goddess, and despise—themselves.</L>
<L>Fantastic changeling! Catch her? Ay! But how?</L>
<L>Th' attempt is bending great Ulysses' bow!</L>
<L>And yet again we come, with random darts;</L>
<L>Now aiming at your heads, now at your hearts:</L>
<L>But all in mirth, and with no ill intent;</L>
<L>At Vice and Folly our few shafts are sent:</L>
<L>We shoot but o'er the house, or in the dark;</L>
<L>Hoping that you'll be pleas'd, whene'er we hit the mark.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY M. G. LEWIS, ESQ. M. P. AUTHOR OF THE MONK, THE CASTLE SPECTRE, &amp;C.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>I AM angry!—Quite angry!—The whole of this night</L>
<L>I've been ready to burst with vexation and spite;</L>
<L>And now am come hither in haste, to disclose</L>
<L>Why grief swells my bosom, and reddens my nose!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In hopes a new road to your favour to find,</L>
<L>The mask of Thalia I lately resigned;</L>
<L>And, undaunted by prejudice, fashion, or scandal,</L>
<L>Melpomene's dagger I ventured to handle.</L>
<L>My heroic exertions, the truth to confess,</L>
<L>By the Public's indulgence were crowned with success;</L>
<L>For, when with distraction my bosom was seized,</L>
<L>I'm sure, you all seemed to be mightily pleased;</L>
<L>When my poniard I drew, you applauded the action;</L>
<L>And, whenever I murdered, showed great satisfaction.</L>
<L>Then is it not hard, that our Author to-night</L>
<L>Should have dragged me at once from my tragical height▪</L>
<L>My Bristol-stone dagger away has he ta'en;</L>
<L>He has cut off four yards of my white satin train,</L>
<L>And presumptuously begs, for the rest of the season,</L>
<L>That I'd try to amuse you with nature and reason!</L>
<L>This prayer, I protested, I never could grant;</L>
<L>I had ranted and raved, and would still rave and rant;</L>
<L>And I told him, this part, which for me he had planned,</L>
<L>Was not half enough furious, terrific, or grand.</L>
<L>I see not one Ghost through the whole of the part;</L>
<L>Cannot once find a place for a Tragedy start:</L>
<L>My bosom I beat not; my locks must not rend;</L>
<L>Nor murder one man from beginning to end!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My displeasure and anger resolved to display,</L>
<L>I called at the door of our Author, one day;</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
Was admitted—sat down—cleared my voice—furled my fan—</L>
<L>Put my critical face on, and gravely began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Says I—"Mr. Thingummy, plainly to speak,</L>
<L>"Your hold on the public opinion is weak;</L>
<L>"For your canvas presents neither Daemons nor Witches▪</L>
<L>"And your Villains appear in coat, waistcoat, and breeches!</L>
<L>"Now let me advise you your subject to change,</L>
<L>"For something that's showy, terrific, and strange.</L>
<L>"That his Play must succeed, may the Bard safely boast,</L>
<L>"Who opens the piece with a Song by a Ghost;</L>
<L>"But in popular plaudits unbounded he revels,</L>
<L>"If he follows the Song with a Dance by two Devils.</L>
<L>"Observe too, you'll greatly increase the effect,</L>
<L>"If your colours with caution and taste you select:</L>
<L>"Thus, to make on the feelings a serious attack,</L>
<L>"Let your Spectres be white, and your Servants be black;</L>
<L>"And, to finish the whole with a striking new Scene,</L>
<L>"Let a Pompadour Prince wed a Coquelicot Queen.</L>
<L>"Give us Lightning and Thunder, Flames, Daggers and Rage;</L>
<L>"With events that ne'er happened, except on the Stage:</L>
<L>"When your Spectre departs, through a trap-door ingulph her,</L>
<L>"Burn under her nose too some brimstone and sulphur;</L>
<L>"Let Magicians and Monsters be poured on our view;</L>
<L>"And stick on your Villains a beard of pale blue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the Romance of Blue-Beard.</NOTE>!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My remonstrance was vain—He asserts, you can be</L>
<L>Well-pleased, when good-sense, mirth, and nature you see,</L>
<L>Though his Play should not leave you half dead with affright:</L>
<L>And I heartily pray, that the man may be right.</L>
<L>As for me (though I'm sorry, my part won't permit</L>
<L>Me to squall at a Spectre, and frighten the Pit),</L>
<L>I hope you'll allow this performance has merit,</L>
<L>And though without Ghost, think 'tis not without spirit;</L>
<L>Which Spirit on Monday, escaping from Styx,</L>
<L>Will appear in this place—at a quarter past six.</L>

<P>Not by becoming a wicked cheat! No, Harry, that's not the way.</P>

<P>You mistake: that is the only way. "'Tis the common calling! For gowns, gold chains, and white wands are its rewards." From high to low 'tis all bargain and sale. And what is bargain and sale? Why to display the good side, and conceal the bad: that is, to cheat and lie!</P>

<P>Oh Harry, Harry! Is all the learning fa∣ther bestowed on thee come to this? He said, when thee run away, how it would be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have travelled, know the world, and mean to profit by my knowledge. Fools and knaves are the two grand classes: for the honest men are too insignificant, and too few, to form a class. Poverty and disgrace are got by keeping them company; and he that would thrive must shun them, as he would the plague.</P>

<P>Surely, Harry, thee canno' be in down∣right earnest?</P>

<P>Such is the world: and shall I, like a driveller, make myself its football? No; it shall be mine! And I will spurn▪ it before me with the contempt it deserves! While I despise and laugh at its prejudices, I will profit by them.</P>

<P>Look thee, Harry, I canno' tell why thee beest so bitter angry wi' the world. I can truly vouch I have met wi' many good folk, and few bad. And as to go for to say that thee beest a lord, I'll do no such thing!</P>

Here beest thee a kind of a school-master, to young Mr. Jonas: which be a dessunt modest call∣ing enough; but not fit for a lord!

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear sweet Miss,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am tired of being snubbed and snapped and crossed and contradicted by my fa∣ther: for, though not so old, I am as tall as he. I don't like my mother a bit better; so I suppose you like your father and mother as little as I do mine: wherefore I have a proposal to make. I hate slavery; so if you'll take heart we'll be mar∣ried, that we may both be free. The thought came into my head last night when you and I and the Count were at tea; so I had a mind to have told you just when I gave your knee two or three nudges, which did but make me think of it ten times the more: which is all at present.</P>

<P>Why ay! Success, fortune, and Aurelia shall be mine! As for fame, give me but wealth, and that will come unasked. And yet my cursed querulous conscience takes part with my sister, and upbraids me for being an impostor. Absurd! Who are not impostors? Is any man the thing he seems? And, if feign we must, is it not better to feign something that the world respects, than something that it despises? The son of a curate, I have dashed into life, met variety of adventures, visited the Continent, and assumed the airs of a foreign Count. I have certainly disgraced myself; but the world does not think so. Who would shew his naked face when a mask is so pleasant, so profitable, and so easily put on? My father gave me education, Nature gave me desires, and I have
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
given myself a title. Why not? "If I am not a lord, it seems I ought to have been. I find no difficulty in being as extravagant as a lord, as proud as a lord, as idle as a lord, and as impudent as a lord. I could game like a lord, be duped like a lord, run in debt like a lord, and never pay, as naturally as if I had been born a lord. Let lords look to it, then, and reform. Let them be as superior to the poor in virtue as they are in power, and I will blush for being an impostor."</P>

<P>Zounds, Madam, do you know that I am a Baronet of seven thousand a year; and that I am but man? That I have raging desires, irri∣tating sensations, headlong passions, and the means of gratifying them? Do you know all that?</P>

<P>Well, well; any thing you wish. Should you ask me to marry, you are such a bewitching sorceress, curse me if I should not instantly com∣ply. I am sure I should, so don't tempt me. Nor don't let my title, nor my seven thousand a year, tempt you. Sit at a proper distance, and turn your eyes t'other way, or, in spite of sixty-five, I shall be fascinated. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
