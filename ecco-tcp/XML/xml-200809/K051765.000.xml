<L>THIS Author sure must be a low Dog</L>
<L>to pick out Me to speak his Prolog'</L>
<L>an Irishman! the silly Elf</L>
<L>had better come and prate himself</L>
<L>But since the foolish Rapparee</L>
<L>will Verse impose on such as Me</L>
<L>I'll tell some Things that late befell</L>
<L>and let the Poet go to Hell</L>
<L>I've been involv'd in peaceful Wars</L>
<L>mongst Regiments of marching Tars;</L>
<L>Sea Fights on Land we've all been losing,</L>
<L>(These Rhymes are of my own exposing)</L>
<L>and to the shame of our brave Fleet</L>
<L>we Victories have got complete</L>
<L>tho' we have stupidly been beat:</L>
<L>But by my shoul our fine Commanders</L>
<L>were Geeses Husbands, two great Ganders!</L>
<L>Our Ship was man'd hy Women all</L>
<L>from the large Boys down to the small:</L>
<L>Then pray observe the pretty Fun</L>
<L>We'd ne'er a Pistol but one Gun:</L>
<L>and one old Halbert for a Sword</L>
<L>with a Steel Cutlass made of board</L>
<L>Those are the necessary Arms</L>
<L>that fill'd the Spaniards with alarms</L>
<L>One Frenchman I saw lying dead,</L>
<L>to end him I shot off his Head;</L>
<L>and yet, dear Sirs, that very day</L>
<L>I saw the Rascal run away.</L>
<L>Pray don't of what I say now prattle—</L>
<L>I murder'd Six Men in fair Battle!</L>
<L>If I can be a Commadore</L>
<L>I'll shew that Three and Two make four:</L>
<L>I'll make a Captain of my Mother,</L>
<L>She shall Command as well's another;</L>
<L>for true as our good Ship's a swimming</L>
<L>We'd sev'ral Officers old Women</L>
<L>I never to my Hammock creep</L>
<L>but I am wak'd before I sleep</L>
<L>but hold! while I thus prate away</L>
<L>They can't go forward with the Play!</L>
<L>good Night, sweet Honies, fen I next appear</L>
<L>you'll see an honest Fortune-Hunter here.</L>
