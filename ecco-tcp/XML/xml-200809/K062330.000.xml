<HEAD>THE DESERTER.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>Conceal'd beneath illustrious deeds,</L>
<L>A simple tale I rear:</L>
<L>A tale that soft-ey'd Pity reads,</L>
<L>And honors with a tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>The Spaniard left the hostile plain,</L>
<L>To seek his native land,</L>
<L>Beneath the sails that swept the main,</L>
<L>CABEYSA join'd the band:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Who as he met his country's foes,</L>
<L>Within the field of Fame,</L>
<L>Above his rank obscure arose</L>
<L>And grac'd his humble name:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Yet not the early wreath of Fame</L>
<L>With haughtiness was twin'd:</L>
<L>Nor pride nor fickleness could claim</L>
<L>The empire of his mind:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>The lowly hut, beneath whose roof</L>
<L>He sigh'd a sad adieu,</L>
<L>Received him (time and distance-proof)</L>
<L>To love and MARY true:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>This hamlet-fair, by Fortune scorn'd,</L>
<L>Seem'd Nature's fav'rite child,</L>
<L>With hand profuse by her adorn'd</L>
<L>—The flow'ret of the wild!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Her neat but homely garment press'd</L>
<L>The pure, the feeling heart,</L>
<L>Oft sought in vain behind the vest</L>
<L>Of decorated art:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>"If sharing all thy cares (she said)</L>
<L>"Has paled my beauty's rose,</L>
<L>"Ah know! for thee the heart that bled,</L>
<L>"With all its passion glows:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>"Blest moment to my wish that gives</L>
<L>"The long long absent youth!</L>
<L>"He lives—th'endear'd CABEYSA lives,</L>
<L>"And love confirms the truth.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>"When thy brave comrades fell around,</L>
<L>"What pow'r's benignant care,</L>
<L>"Secur'd thee from the fatal wound?</L>
<L>"And MARY from despair?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>"Oft in the troubling dream of night</L>
<L>"I saw the rushing spear,</L>
<L>"Nor did the morn's awak'ning light</L>
<L>"Dispel the ling'ring fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>"Thy tender fears (the youth replied)</L>
<L>"Ah give them to the air!</L>
<L>"To happiness we're now allied,</L>
<L>"And pleasure be our care:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Let us pursue the joy begun,</L>
<L>"Nor lose by dull delay:</L>
<L>"Say, MARY, shall to-morrow's sun</L>
<L>"Illume our nuptial day?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>With look declin'd she blush'd consent—</L>
<L>Reserve that takes alarm,</L>
<L>And Love and Joy their influence lent</L>
<L>To raise meek Beauty's charm.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>The guests, to hail the wedded pair,</L>
<L>Beneath their roof repair'd,</L>
<L>With them the little feast to share</L>
<L>Their scanty purse prepar'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' no delicious wines were pour'd,</L>
<L>Mirth took his destin'd place,</L>
<L>The hand-maid Neatness spread the board,</L>
<L>And sage Content said grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>Scarce thro' one hasty week had Love</L>
<L>His grateful blessings shed,</L>
<L>When bliss (as flies the frighted dove)</L>
<L>Their humble mansion fled:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>'Twas at BELLONA'S voice it flew,</L>
<L>That call'd to war's alarms;</L>
<L>Bad the youth rise to valor true,</L>
<L>And break from MARY'S arms:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>But she still strained him to her heart,</L>
<L>To lengthen the adieu:</L>
<L>"Ah what, (she said) shou'dst thou depart,</L>
<L>"Shall I and sorrow do?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>"Say, valiant youth, when thou'rt away</L>
<L>"Who'll raise my drooping head?</L>
<L>"How shall I chace the fears that say</L>
<L>"Thy lov'd CABEYSA'S dead?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>"With thine my fate I now involve,</L>
<L>"Intent thy course to steer,</L>
<L>"No words shall shake my firm resolve,</L>
<L>"Not ev'n that trickling tear:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>"Fram'd for each scene of soft delight,</L>
<L>"(He said) thy gentle form,</L>
<L>"As shrinks the lily at the blight,</L>
<L>"Will droop beneath the storm:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Blest in thy presence! ev'ry pain</L>
<L>"(She added) brings its charm,</L>
<L>"And love, tho' falls the beating rain,</L>
<L>"Will keep this bosom warm.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>Her zeal (the supplement of strength)</L>
<L>Upheld her many a day,</L>
<L>But Nature's pow'rs subdued at length,</L>
<L>On Sickness' couch she lay:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>Three painful days unseen she lay</L>
<L>Of him she held so dear:</L>
<L>"Ah does he thus my love repay?</L>
<L>She said—and dropt a tear:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>"CABEYSA, at a league's remove,</L>
<L>"Dwells on the tent-spread hill:</L>
<L>"Ah wherefore did he vow true love,</L>
<L>"And not that vow fulfil?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="27">
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>XXVII.</HEAD>
<L>Yet not deficiency of truth</L>
<L>Forbad to yield relief,</L>
<L>Stern pow'r with-held the tender youth,</L>
<L>And duty to his chief:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="28">
<HEAD>XXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>Who wisely-counsel'd drew a line,</L>
<L>To check the hand of Stealth,</L>
<L>That ravag'd wide th' encircling vine,</L>
<L>The humble peasant's wealth:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="29">
<HEAD>XXIX.</HEAD>
<L>To pass the line, it was ordain'd,</L>
<L>Whoever shou'd presume,</L>
<L>Shou'd a Deserter be arraign'd,</L>
<L>And meet the coward's doom:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="30">
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>XXX.</HEAD>
<L>This law by equity approv'd,</L>
<L>And to the peasant dear,</L>
<L>Soon to the brave CABEYSA prov'd</L>
<L>Destructively severe:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="31">
<HEAD>XXXI.</HEAD>
<L>Now MARY'S image haunts his soul,</L>
<L>In Woe's dark tints array'd,</L>
<L>While to his breast compassion stole,</L>
<L>And all her claims display'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="32">
<HEAD>XXXII.</HEAD>
<L>"For me her native home, (he said)</L>
<L>"For me each weeping friend,</L>
<L>"For me a father's arms she fled—</L>
<L>"And shall not love attend?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="33">
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>XXXIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Say, for a chosen lover's sake,</L>
<L>"What more cou'd woman do?</L>
<L>"And now that health and peace forsake,</L>
<L>"Shall I forsake her too?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="34">
<HEAD>XXXIV.</HEAD>
<L>"Now stretch'd upon the naked ground,</L>
<L>"Oppress'd with pain and fear</L>
<L>"She casts a languid eye around,</L>
<L>"Nor sees CABEYSA near:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="35">
<HEAD>XXXV.</HEAD>
<L>"Now, now she weeps at my delay,</L>
<L>"And shall neglect be mine?</L>
<L>"Submit, ye fears, to Pity's sway!</L>
<L>He spoke—and cross'd the line.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="36">
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>XXXVI.</HEAD>
<L>Soon at his sight the fair resum'd</L>
<L>Each captivating grace:</L>
<L>On her pale cheek the rose rebloom'd,</L>
<L>And smiles illum'd her face.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="37">
<HEAD>XXXVII.</HEAD>
<L>Yet to that cheek return'd in vain</L>
<L>Bright Health's vermilion dye,</L>
<L>For bitter tears that cheek shall stain,</L>
<L>And dim her brilliant eye:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="38">
<HEAD>XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>The youth returning thro' the gloom</L>
<L>At midnight's secret hour,</L>
<L>Was seiz'd—and to dishonour's tomb</L>
<L>Doom'd by the martial pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="39">
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>XXXIX.</HEAD>
<L>To meet his fate at wake of day</L>
<L>(Love's victim) he was led,</L>
<L>No weakness did his cheek betray,</L>
<L>While to the chief he said:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="40">
<HEAD>XL.</HEAD>
<L>"If in the battle death I've dar'd,</L>
<L>"In all its horror drest,</L>
<L>"Think not this scene, by thee prepar'd,</L>
<L>"Sheds terror on my breast:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="41">
<HEAD>XLI.</HEAD>
<L>"Yet, at MARIA'S hapless fate,</L>
<L>"My fortitude impairs,</L>
<L>"Unmann'd I sink beneath the weight</L>
<L>"Of her oppressive cares:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="42">
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>XLII.</HEAD>
<L>"Ah! when her grief-torn heart shall bleed,</L>
<L>"Some little solace grant,</L>
<L>"Oh guard her in the hour of need</L>
<L>"From the rude hand of want:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="43">
<HEAD>XLIII.</HEAD>
<L>Now, kneeling on the fatal spot,</L>
<L>He twin'd the dark'ning band:</L>
<L>The twelve, who drew th'unwelcome lot,</L>
<L>Reluctant took their stand:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="44">
<HEAD>XLIV.</HEAD>
<L>And now the murm'ring throng grew dumb,</L>
<L>'Twas silence all—save where,</L>
<L>At intervals, the mournful drum</L>
<L>Struck horror on the ear:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="45">
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
<HEAD>XLV.</HEAD>
<L>Now, with their death-fraught tubes uprear'd,</L>
<L>The destin'd twelve were seen—</L>
<L>And now the explosion dire was heard</L>
<L>That clos'd CABEYSA'S scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="46">
<HEAD>XLVI.</HEAD>
<L>Another scene remain'd behind</L>
<L>For MARY to supply—</L>
<L>She comes! mark how her tortur'd mind</L>
<L>Speaks thro' th'expressive eye:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="47">
<HEAD>XLVII.</HEAD>
<L>"Forbear—will ye in blood (she said)</L>
<L>"Your cruel hands imbrue?</L>
<L>"On me, on me your vengeance shed,</L>
<L>"To me alone 'tis due:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="48">
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>XLVIII.</HEAD>
<L>"Relent—and to these arms again</L>
<L>"The valiant youth restore.</L>
<L>"I rave—already on the plain</L>
<L>"He welters in his gore.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="49">
<HEAD>XLIX.</HEAD>
<L>Advancing now, she pierc'd the crowd,</L>
<L>And reach'd the fatal place,</L>
<L>Where, listing from the corse the shroud,</L>
<L>No semblance cou'd she trace.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="50">
<HEAD>L.</HEAD>
<L>"Is this—oh blasting view! (she cried)</L>
<L>"The youth who lov'd too well!</L>
<L>"His love for me the law defied,</L>
<L>"And for that love he fell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="51">
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>LI.</HEAD>
<L>"When will the grave this form receive?</L>
<L>"The grave to which he's fled?</L>
<L>"There, only there I'll cease to grieve.</L>
<L>She spoke—And join'd the dead.</L>
