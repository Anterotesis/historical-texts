<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE immortal Author of Hudibras af∣firms, the hardest task in the world is to write a play; it is, therefore, no wonder that writers of plays are prone to regard their la∣bours with fondness, even to partiality; or that they should perceive with regret the light esteem in which a part of the literary world have lately affected to hold them. Works of rudi∣ment, of disquisition, nay, even, of mere compilation, are often treated by criticism with a respect which a comedy, or tragedy, where wit, invention, genius, and all the highest faculties of the mind have, or ought to have, been employed, seldom meets. The theatre, however it may be debased by the nightly intrusion of unhappy and improper persons, has a most powerful and good in∣fluence on morals, which increases with in∣dustry, and as the means of gaining admission among the lower class increase. Much time is there spent to the best, the noblest, of pur∣poses; the body's fatigues are forgotten, the mind is beguiled of its cares, the sad heart is made merry, fictitious sorrow obliterates real, and the soul, imbibing virtuous and heroic principles, is roused and impelled to actions that honour not only individuals but nations, and give a dignity to human nature. Those who can doubt this are to be pitied. And it is piteous, most piteous, that, not only the learned, but, the political world should treat the stage with neglect; nay, with contempt:
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
that they do not combine, and employ the high powers they possess to the encouragement and perfection of an art which, being, in its own nature, so delightful, so fascinating, is capable of contributing, so infinitely, to the happiness, as well as to the pleasure, of man∣kind.</P>
<P>These ideas have long, and often, occurred to my mind, where they have acted with in∣creasing force. If I have written a comedy which, perfectly moral in its tendency, and counteracting a fashionable vice that is in danger of becoming a vulgar one, has charms sufficient to attract spectators, I am of opinion I have done my country an essential service. That some who read this may call me vain or presumptuous is, to me, totally indifferent. The theatre is a subject of such consequence to virtue, happiness, and man, that I cannot forbear speaking of it with a sense of feeling which, I fear, I cannot impart.</P>
<P>I must now undertake a task of a very dif∣ferent and painful nature; the cause of my undertaking it shall be given, when I have told my story.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1785, I wrote the Opera of the Choleric Fathers, and the Comedy of Seduction. They were both put into the hands of Mr. Harris, on certain conditions; the substance of which was that, if, after read∣ing, he should approve the pieces, they were both to be played, during the ensuing season, the first in November, and the latter in January,
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
or the beginning of February, 1786. They were read by Mr. Harris, and both accepted, on these conditions; and so precise, so per∣fectly explained, were they that they were re∣duced to writing. However, certain objec∣tions arising, on the part of Mr. Harris, con∣cerning benefit nights (not the time of perform∣ing the pieces, for that remained determined) I, myself, tore the written agreement; saying, I thought it improbable men, who meant ho∣nestly and honourably, should differ in trifles; and that each other's word was sufficient.</P>
<P>When Mr. Harris had read Seduction, though he objected to parts, he was, yet, so well pleased with the whole, that he said, with evident, and peculiar, satisfaction, I had given the theatre a comedy which, he thought, would do it no harm.</P>
<P>Having made his objections, alterations were agreed on, and the comedy taken back. Further to prove how fully the word of Mr. Harris was engaged, how perfectly he under∣stood himself pledged to abide by his agree∣ment, while the Opera of the Choleric Fathers was preparing for representation, Mr. Harris sent to me, to make a new proposal, which, according to him, would highly benefit the theatre. This was that, instead of January, I should suffer the comedy to be brought out before Christmas, because he had a new panto∣mime (Omai) that would, in all probability, be greatly beneficial to the theatre, after Christmas, and that his season would then
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
be filled up, and, probably, exceedingly pro∣ductive. That my interest might not suffer by this arrangement, he promised, in com∣pensation, to suffer the new pantomime to be played for my third benefit, and, if the comedy ran a certain number of nights, for my fourth. When he made this proposition I desired time to consider, and consult my friends; and, at last, from a sincere wish to oblige Mr. Harris, and serve the theatre, acquiesced. This pro∣ject, however, was deranged; not by me, or Mr. Harris; but by an event highly vexatious to both, and which I shall not relate now; perhaps never.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the play had received some alterations, and the insertion of a cha∣racter so atrocious, yet so frequent, in this town, as to make, in the opinion of Mr. Harris, the representation of it dangerous. Accordingly, this was to be expunged, still further alterations were undertaken, and the comedy, a third time, delivered, as it is at pre∣sent played, about the beginning of December, 1785. It will be necessary to remark that, before this, the Choleric Fathers had been performed, and did not take that run which Mr. Harris expected, and I had hoped; and that, knowing the changeable disposition of Mr. Harris, I cautioned him against suffering this mediocrity of success to influence, and prejudice, his mind against the comedy. He assured me it should not.</P>
<P>I must likewise state that, so self-denying
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
was I, and desirous of promoting the welfare of the theatre, when Mr. Harris informed me, by Mr. Lewis, he had no further hopes from the Opera, which had then been played seven nights, and that he would allow me the eighth instead of the ninth night, but adding he doubted whether I should clear expences; I, though there was no probability of loss, and, certainly, some of gain, gave up my third night to the theatre; telling Mr. Lewis I would not deprive Mr. Harris of a night, un∣der such circumstances.</P>
<P>The Comedy remained with Mr. Harris, who, I was told, was gone out of town, till the beginning of January, without my re∣ceiving any information of its being preparing for rehearsal. I began to be alarmed; and, unable to obtain an interview, or even dis∣cover where Mr. Harris was, I wrote a letter to him, expressive of these alarms. I need not describe what my feelings were, a few days after, on receiving the comedy back, with a letter from Mr. Harris, in which these feelings were indeed little respected, inform∣ing me it could not succeed. The manner of sending it back was, almost, as extraordinary as the act. It was brought, loosely tied up with packthread, in a bit of dirty brown pa∣per, unsealed, by the servant of Mr. O'Keefe. I mean not to insinuate any possible disad∣vantage to the character of Mr. O'Keefe: far to the contrary. I have often heard him ho∣nourably mentioned. Neither can I say how
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
it came into his hands, or that he knew what it was; but this is no palliation of Mr. Harris's conduct. I returned no answer; it would have been exceedingly wrong to have trusted the irritated mind at such a moment.</P>
<P>I will now give my reasons for relating this transaction to the world. To pretend I did not feel all the indignation which conduct like this must kindle, would be to assume an apathy contrary to nature; and, even, to virtue. This, however, has worn off: I act coolly, at pre∣sent, and from a sense of duty, not revenge. As far as relates to myself, I would wish the affair might never more be remembered; but, if men in similar situations might act thus <HI>always</HI> with impunity, as they <HI>too often</HI> do, what means could the weak and unprotected find of obtaining redress; what security in their dealings with a man, who, regardless of probity, and yielding to the caprice of opi∣nion, the dictates of pride, or the narrow motives of self-interest, does not scruple to break his word, so pledged, and engagements thus formal?</P>
<P>This narrative will scarcely be more dis∣agreeable to Mr. Harris to read than it has been to me to write: it is not my own cause I plead, for that was gained in the success of my Comedy; but the cause of the weak against the strong; the cause of hereafter genius against hereafter injustice; the cause of the man, who, endowed with gifts of which Nature herself is proud, but deprived of every
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
benefit of Fortune, shall devote his days and nights to study, and suffer every abstinence with resignation, and, even with delight, cheered by the sweet hope of being some time known for what he is. There is a momentary intoxication, a delirium of soul, in this hope, which not the daily privation of pleasures, the disappointments of years, the labours of a life, nor injustice itself can counterbalance. It is this godlike sensation which has given the mind an impetus, and made it produce works so various, and so vast, that, glancing at their amplitude and sublimity, it stands confounded at its own powers!</P>
<P>That I may avoid all appearance of min∣gling flattery with an appeal to justice, I shall forbear describing the conduct of the Proprie∣tors of Drury-Lane; except saying, they have behaved to me like Gentlemen, and men of honour.</P>
<P>My heart will not, however, suffer me to be equally reserved, and silent, concerning Mr. King. The moment he was convinced the producing of this Comedy would proba∣bly serve, not injure, the Theatre, his zeal and activity, in my cause, were indefatigable: how very essentially his powers, as an actor, have contributed to its success is too public for me (had I a wish so selfish) to conceal. But this is not the first debt of gratitude from me to Mr. King; his friendship, or his philanthropy, while I was struggling into notice, and com∣bating with adverse fortune, did me a gene∣rous
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
kindness which never can, nor ever ought to be forgotten.</P>
<P>The Town have beheld, with delight and surprise, the increasing excellence of Miss Farren; and, thinking she had attained per∣fection, have been astonished, when they saw her next, at their own mistake. In the pre∣sent instance, her exertions, and even the very manner of them, have been as pleasing to me, as they were beneficial to the Comedy. I can only add, she has excelled herself; and, though that thought be old, it never was more properly applied.</P>
<P>Having mentioned these, it were injustice to the rest of the performers not to thank them; both for the display of talents, the merits of which are well known, and the ardour, I may say the anxiety, they testified for my success. Yes, I most sincerely thank them all; and only forbear to name them, individually, because I cannot find expressions, various and warm enough, to convey my thoughts, without making true and well deserved praise assume the form of laboured panegyric.</P>

<P>A wonderful change in a short time!—Lady Morden, young, handsome, and full of spirits, was, not a month ago, reserved in her conduct, fond of her husband, contented with home, and, indeed, a miraculous kind of ex∣ception among wives of quality. Whereas, now, she has suddenly turned fantastical in dress, capricious in temper, free of speech, and, what we half-bred folks should call, light of carriage. She games with the women, coquettes with the men, and seems, in every respect, ambitious to become—a woman of fashion. As for my Lord—why—he is a man of fashion.</P>

<P>Nay, good doctor, you really wrong me; 'tis not the advice, but the physic, I hate—At least, I hate the form under which it is administered—But, pray, tell me; when last you saw Lady Morden, did you perceive any symptoms of that degeneracy, in her Lady∣ship, you, now, complain so loudly of?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Burland.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Just as you left town, her Lady∣ship's melancholy seemed increasing—wandering over the house, like a perturbed spirit, as the play says, mournfully clanking her chains, and frightening the gentle smiles and pleasures from her, she seemed to way-lay me, and, with moving look, and melting eye, intreat compas∣sion; till, egad, I, really, at last, began to pity her.</P>
</SP>

<P>You did!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes—But, suddenly forsaking the—<HI>penseroso,</HI> she broke in upon me, one morn∣ing, and, with an air of levity and good hu∣mour, and a small tincture of reproach, then, and there, read me a very pretty, wifelike, re∣monstrance.</P>

<P>And what was the subject of her discourse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, chapter the first was a recapitulation of my agreeable follies, and her own perverse virtues.—She was no partaker in my pleasures—I had forgot every endearment—She was left to dine, sup, and sleep, by herself—I dined, supped, and slept, nobody knew where.—She more recluse than the abbess of a convent:
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
I more uncertain than the price of stocks, or the place of prime minister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Burland.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[with earnest concern]</STAGE> And what did you say to this?</P>

<P>You did not attempt to deny the charge, then?</P>
</SP>

<P>What should I deny? 'Twas every syllable true; and every syllable in my praise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><STAGE>[sighs]</STAGE> Humph!—Then you do not think, the sweets of affection ought, sometimes, to alleviate the bitterness of neglect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sweets! pshaw! they are too cloying to the stomach, and ought to be taken sparingly.—I am fond of sweet music, but too much of it sets me to sleep.—Besides, a wife, like a barrel organ, can only play one set of tunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Burland.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[sighs]</STAGE> Well, Sir, but the conclusion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very unexpected one, I as∣sure you—I misunderstood this for a declara∣tion of war; and, with a smile, was very oblig∣ingly about to intreat her Ladyship would hatch her melancholy into mischief her own way: when, turning short upon me, she curtsied, seemed abashed, began to apologize, applaud my conduct, ridicule the silliness of her own, and promised to become as fashionable a Lady as I, or any Lord in Christendom, could wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Burland.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your increase of happiness is, then, prodigious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hem!—a—unspeakable.—Lady Morden, I own, was, certainly, a kind of—
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
Demi-Angel, tho' my wife—but, then, her—her goodness seemed to throw one at such a distance—so much in the back ground that there was only one figure noticed in the picture!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Burland.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis well, Sir, you are so per∣fectly satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, General, I will own, I have often felt a kind of inclination, a sort of wish, as it were, to become very prudent, and wise, and—and all that—but, really, one has so much to do that one does not know where to be∣gin.—Besides, you very good kind of people, you—upon my honour, you are, in many re∣spects, the most queer, precise, particular, species of beings, and have such strange notions!—In∣stead of taking one's pleasure, and doing just what one likes best, which, you know, is so na∣tural, one must live for the good of one's country, love one's wife and children, pay tradesmen, look over accounts, reward merit, and a thousand other of the—the most ridiculous whims—and what nobody, absolutely, nobody does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen. <HI>Burland.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Intolerable profligacy!—I have listened to you, my Lord, with grief, vexation, astonishment, and pity!—Your mind is degraded; and the more dangerously so because you believe your worst vices to be your greatest merits! You have had honour, happiness, and pleasure, of the most perfect kind, within your power; and you have rejected them, to clasp their shadows! To merit pity by misconduct is humiliating; but, by misconduct to incur contempt is, to a manly spi∣rit, insupportable; and the latter will, I fear, be suddenly your Lordship's fate. Did not the re∣membrance of your noble father affect me, I should look upon your approaching punishment
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
with apathy; because you wilfully have plunged to perdition: but, for your Lady, if I cannot retrieve, if I cannot save her, I shall mourn in∣deed!</P>

<P>In praise of virtue.

<HEAD>SCENE IV. <STAGE>SIR FREDERIC, LADY MORDEN.</STAGE></HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Frederic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This fellow would outwit a whole conclave of Cardinals!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Frederic! here I am, you see; punctual to my promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Frederic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[with vast insinuation, seeming sin∣cerity, and humble rapture, all through the scene.]</STAGE> Oh, Madam, how can I repay this bounty!—this condescension!—Never!—My life were a poor sacrifice, to such sweetness and such charms!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Frederic, this is a trying, a decisive moment! I am going to be either the most happy or the most wretched of women! You tell me, it is your wish, your resolution, to be no longer that general lover, that man of the world, you have, hitherto, been thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Frederic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say not, dear Lady, it is either my wish or resolution! Heaven can testify, I have not the power to be any thing, but what it shall please you to make me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have owned to you that, the levity I have lately affected is not natural to me▪ that my heart sighs for an acquaintance, a mate▪ that, like itself, is subject to all the sweet emo∣tions of sensibility!—Yes, it was the first wish of my soul to find this correspondent heart! A heart beating with the same ardour, vibrating to the same sensations, panting for the same pleasures, shrinking from the same pangs; pliant, yet firm; gentle, yet aspiring; passionate, yet pure!—Such I once thought Lord Morden's—Should I, a second time, be deceived!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Frederic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am poor in proofs of sincerity! I have none to offer!—My former errors are present punishments! To deny or even palliate them would imply intentional deceit; and this is a moment in which I would wish for men and gods to be witnesses of my truth!—I have had, I own, most libertine opinions of your gentle sex; but these I, now, solemnly renounce!—Had I, before, met with a Lady Morden, I should, be∣fore, have made this renunciation!—But, per∣haps, the women it has been my misfortune to know deserved, in part, the light esteem in which I held them.—Never, till now, did I find one who could mutually inspire such passion and re∣spect! Such agitated, burning, hopes! Such excruciating fears, or thoughts so sanctified, as those I, this moment, feel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, Sir Frederic, I cannot help observing your conversation, in society, seems still tinged with the impurity of your for∣mer libertine principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Frederic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I own, Lady Morden, with con∣fusion own, I have not hitherto had the courage, or, perhaps, I have wanted strength to stem the torrent: but, aided by you, I feel, I dare pro∣mise any thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Morden.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, Sir Frederic, the mind finds some difficulty in rooting out fears, planted in it by reiterated accusations. The stories the world tells of you are dreadful! And, yet, there is such heartfelt conviction attends your present words that, to me, it is impossible to listen and retain a doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Frederic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This generous confidence trans∣ports me, fills me with gratitude, and inspires
