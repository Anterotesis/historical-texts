<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE aversion a woman ought to feel at the necessity of engaging even in a literary contest has induced me to endure a variety of imputations; yet, to publish a piece, and leave all unanswered, might at once give a sanction to the past, and encou∣rage future slanders:—let this plead my excuse for introducing myself to those who have so generously received a comedy I would wish more worthy their patronage.</P>
<P>Charged early in life with the care of a family, I accompanied my father eight years ago into the rules of a prison, where the perjury of an enemy, and the injustice of a judge for a time confined him. To amuse some of my melancholy leisure, I there (from a fondness for Marmontel's beautiful tale of Lauretta) first conceived the design of introducing into the Drama a female heart, capable of frailty, yet shuddering at vice, and perhaps sufficiently punished in her own feelings. A lover, whose error was likewise in his heart, not head; and even for him I contrived a chastisement in the agony of losing her: nor did I imagine, in adopting a religious te∣net, I could ever be accused of offending morality. Subsequent characters and incidents arose in the manner they now appear, except that the governor had then no place in it. It is now seven years since the piece was brought thus forward; soon after which a friend lent me a translation of Monsieur Diderot's Pere de Famille.—This fine performance gave me infinite pleasure under all the disadvan∣tages of a translation; and the chance-similitude
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
which now and then occurred between that and mine rather flattered than grieved me, since, con∣scious of my own originality, and imagining even my worst enemy, if he charged me with a plagiarism, would at least allow, while the subject was new to our stage, my only crime was in denying it.—I re∣turned the translated play, and mine lay dormant several years. Sentiment was now exploded, and I therefore sought to diversify it with humour. The character of the austere Commander in Monsieur Diderot's play had particularly pleased me; and not being mistress of the French language, I sought in vain for a translation, on purpose to interweave him into mine. Not able to meet with any, I created the character of Governor Harcourt, whose chief likeness to the French uncle is in name) and heightened the piece with every event relative to him: but an unbounded partiality I must ever retain for music made me finish it as a three act opera.</P>
<P>In the interim my father had been engaged as a capital Actor by Mr. Harris. Life opened gradu∣ally upon me, and dissipated the illusions of ima∣gination. I learnt that merit merely is a very in∣sufficient recommendation to managers in general; and as I had neither a prostituted pen or person to offer Mr. Harris, I gave up, without a trial, all thoughts of the Drama, and sought an humble home in Bath, resolving to bury in my own heart its little talent, and be a poor any thing rather than a poor author. Some valuable friends, I had long possessed there, insisted I should be wanting to myself in consigning this piece voluntarily to oblivion, and offered me a recommendation to Mr. Harris, with a promise of concealing my name, unless it was accept∣ed. I could desire nothing more: and under these circumstances it was put into that gentleman's
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
hands above a twelvemonth ago. The praises he gave it induced my friend to own my name, and from that moment (let his conscience tell him why) it sunk in Mr. Harris's favour. He said he had frequently refused a play of Mr. Macklin's taken from le Pere de Famille, and could not accept an∣other on the same subject; insisted, that the serious part of mine was all Diderot's; advised me to cut it entirely out, and convert the humorous part into an after-piece, which be would bring out in the course of the season.—Reasons very remote from the Stage could alone induce me to listen a moment to his proposal, and those brought me a hundred miles to converse with him on the subject; when he pro∣duced me the copy sent him, so worn out and dirty, that I had reason to conclude he had lent it to every one he knew, at least.—I was enough mistress of myself to listen with complaisance to the most super∣cilious and unmeaning criticisms, and agreed to mu∣tilate it according to his ideas. The Actors were now named. I had every reason to imagine it a settled thing; and returning to Bath, sent the reduced copy at the appointed time, viz. early in September. A month elapsed without my even knowing he had re∣ceived it; when, with the continued ill-manners of addressing me by a third person, (for he never wrote a single line in answer to several letters) I was shewn a paragraph from Mr. Harris by the friend already mentioned, importing, that I "had sent him <HI>four</HI> acts instead of <HI>two,</HI> and must still take away half; adding, that he advised me by all means to re∣tain my own, disregarding Diderot's."—I did retain my own; for, as the manuscript was luckily returned for another alteration, I thought it time to consider what was due to myself, and that the character of mildness and complacency would be rather dearly
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
bought if I gave up all merit for it; I therefore wrote him a civil letter, and finally withdrew it.</P>
<P>I shall not expatiate on this treatment. I was perhaps in some degree blameable, for believing that man would set any value on my time or my money, who knew not the value of his own; nay, I may be in reality obliged to him in one sense, since his ac∣ceptance of my Comedy would inevitably have con∣signed to oblivion those parts of it honored with the most lavish applause.</P>
<P>What pleasure do I feel in retracting the general aspersion cast upon managers, when I speak of Mr. Colman—Obliged to get the piece represented if possible, lest the subject should be borrowed (an evil too common of late) I enclosed it with an anonymous letter to that Gentleman, briefly relating these par∣ticulars, and it was left at his house early in the year by an unknown person. At the expiration of a fort∣night the manuscript or his answer was demanded, and the latter by this means rendered both impartial and decisive. Mr. Colman thought the general name of Author entitled to the compliment of his own hand-writing; and, by a flattering opinion, and immediate acceptance of my piece, encouraged me to avow myself. By his advice I cut out the songs, and lengthened it into five acts. Nor did his kindness end there. He gave me the benefit of his judgment and experience, both in heightening and abbreviating the business, with every attention in casting and getting it up; generously uniting to the name of Manager that of Friend Mr. Colman has brought into no∣tice a woman who will ever with pride and plea∣sure acknowledge the obligation.</P>

<P>Why, methinks, you are grown mighty grand, or you would have come to the still-room to ask; will you chuse any chocolate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vane.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't you see I am dead?—absolutely dead; and, if you was to touch me, I should shake to meer dust, like an Egyptian mummy. Because it was not provoking enough to lounge away a whole summer in the country, here am I driven up to town, as if the devil was at my heels in the shape of our hopeful heir; who has neither suffered my Lord nor me to rest one moment, thro' his confounded impa∣tience to see his uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>War.</SPEAKER>
<P>Umph,—he'll have enough of the old gen∣tleman presently. He is the very moral of my poor dear lady, his sister, who never was at peace herself, nor suffer'd any one else to be so. Such a house as we have had ever since he came!—why he is more full of importance and airs than a bailiff in possession; and hectors over Miss Mortimer, 'till she almost keeps her chamber to avoid him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vane.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hates Miss Mortimer!—why, here 'll be the devil to pay about her, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>War.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hate her? ay, that he does. He look'd, as if he could have kill'd her, the moment she came down to see him; and got into his chamber presently after, where he sends for me.—"Who is this young wo∣man, Mrs. What's your name?" says he. Why, sir, says I, she is the orphan of a Colonel Mortimer, whose intimacy with my Lord, says I—"Pho, pho, says he, all that I know, woman; what does she do in this house?" says he; his face wrinkling all over,
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
like cream when it's skimming. Why, sir, says I, her father unluckily died, just before the Duke his brother, and so could not leave her one shilling of all that fine fortune; so my Lord intends to marry her to Mr. Woodville, says I.—"He does? cries he; heav'n be prais'd I'm come in time to mar that dainty project, however. You may go, woman, and tell Miss, I don't want any thing more to-night."—So up goes I to Miss Mortimer, and tells her all this. Lord! how glad she was, to find he intended to break the match, tho' she can't guess what he means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vane.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul, I think, it is full as hard to guess what she means. What the devil, will not my Lord's title, fortune, and only son, be a great catch for a girl without a friend or a shilling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>War.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but I could tell you a little story, would explain all.—You must know,

<P>You are welcome to England, brother! I am sorry your native air pays you so ill a compliment after sixteen years absence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Faith, my Lord, and so am I too, I pro∣mise you: I put up with these things tolerably well in the Indies; I did not go there to be happy; but,
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
after all my labours, to find I have just got the money when it is out of my power to enjoy it, is a cursed stroke:—like a fine ship of war, I am only come home to be dismasted and converted into an hospital. However, I am glad <HI>you</HI> hold it better: I don't think you look'd as well when we parted. My sister, poor Susan! she is gone too:—well, we can never live a day the longer for thinking on't. Where's Frank? is he still the image of his mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just as you left him, but that the inno∣cence of the boy is dignified by the knowledge of the man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will hardly remember his old uncle!—I did love the rogue, that's the truth on't; and never look'd at my money-bags but I thought of him. However, you have provided him a wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; you saw her on your arrival, I suppose, for I left her in town to attend a sick aunt. Poor Mortimer!—he died one month before the Duke his brother, and missed a fine title and estate. You know how I loved the honest fellow, and cannot won∣der I took home his orphan'd daughter, as a match for Woodville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, brother! you are too generous; it is your foible, and artful people know how to con∣vert it to their own advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, if a foible, the noblest incident to humanity. Sophia has birth, merit, accomplish∣ments; and wants nothing but money to qualify her for any rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can she have a worse want on earth? Birth, merit, accomplishments, are the very things that ren∣der money more essential: if she had been brought up in a decent plain way indeed,—but she has the airs of a peeress already; and, if any philosopher doubts of the perpetual motion, I would advise him to watch the knocker of your house. Then you have, out of your precise decorums, removed your son, to make way for this flirt of fashion; and what is the conse∣quence of rendering him thus early his own master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you run on thus, only to divert your∣self, with all my heart; but, if you would throw a real imputation on Miss Mortimer's conduct, she is entitled to my serious defence. I never saw any good arise from secluding young people; and authorise Woodville and Sophia to live with that innocent ele∣gance, which renders ev'ry rank easy, and prevents pleasure from seducing the heart, or ignorance the senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I am amazed at you! was there ever yet a woman who didn't mean to pass for a god∣dess? Do they not gain upon us continually, 'till nothing of our prerogative remains but the name? We are wise fellows truly, if we do not keep down this humour of theirs as long as possible, by breeding them in retirement. Every tinsel fop will find address enough to convince wife she is an angel; and the husband must be lucky, as well as sensible, who re∣conciles her to treatment so inferior to her deserts. Woodville will agree with me, I dare say; for the character suits with his intended; and, 'faith, he will
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
make but a modish husband, or he could not endure to see her flying about, like the queen-bee with the whole hive at her heels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too captious, brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you too placid, brother! if, like me, you had been toiling a third of your days to compass a favourite design, and found it disappointed at the moment you thought it complete, what would even your serene Lordship say and do?—here have I pro∣mised myself a son in yours,—an heir in yours;—instead of which,—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>His marriage with Miss Mortimer will not make him unworthy either title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mention her name to me, I beg, my Lord!—I hate all mode-mongers of either sex: the wife, I would have given him, has beauty without knowing it, innocence without knowing it, because she knows nothing else, and to surprize you further forty thousand pounds without knowing it—nay, to bring all your surprizes together, is my daughter without knowing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your daughter? why have you married since my sister's death? your daughter by <HI>her,</HI> you lost before you went abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I shall find her again I believe—I know you will call this one of my odd whims as usual, but we all have some, witness this dainty pro∣ject of yours; and so I will tell you the truth in spite of that project.—from the very birth of this girl, I saw her mother would spoil her, and, had she liv'd, proposed kidnapping Miss in her infancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kidnap your own daughter!—why bro∣ther I need only prove this to obtain a commission of lunacy, and shut you up for life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, tho' my wife was your Lordship's sister, I will venture to tell you she was plaguy fan∣tastical, and contriv'd to torment me as much with her <HI>virtues,</HI> as others by their <HI>vices</HI>—such a fuss about her <HI>delicacy,</HI> her <HI>sensibility,</HI> and her <HI>refinement,</HI> that I could neither look nor speak, without offending one or the other; and execrated the inventor of the jargon ev'ry hour in the four and twenty: a jargon, I re∣solved my girl should never learn; and heav'n no sooner took her mother, heaven be praised for all things, than I dispatch'd her draggle-tailed French governess; made a bonfire of ev'ry book on educa∣tion; whip'd Miss into a post-chaise (under a pre∣tence of placing her in a nunnery) instead of which, I journey'd into Wales and left her under the care of a poor curate's wife, whose name was up as the best housewife in the whole country; then return'd, with a solemn history of her death in the small-pox.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, this is indeed astonishing! an ad∣mirable tutoress truly for my niece!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but there's a better jest than that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—Is that possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you think I contrived to <HI>make</HI> them obey my instructions?—I saw they suspected I was some rich humorist, and was afraid they would, after all, make a little bit of a gentlewoman of her, for which reason, except the first year in advance, they never had a single shilling of my money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is almost incredible! and so you left your only child to the charity of strangers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, not so bad as that neither.—You remember my honest servant, Hardy? after the poor fellow's leg was shot off in my tent, I promis'd him a maintenance; so entrusting him with the secret, order'd him to live in the neighbourhood, have an eye on the girl, and claim her if ill-used:—fine accounts I had from him, 'faith! the old parson and his wife, having no children, and not finding any one own her, gave out she was <HI>theirs,</HI> and doated on her; in short, she is the little wonder of the country; tall as the palm-tree! with cheeks, that might shame the draw∣ing-room; and eyes, will dim the diamonds I have brought over to adorn them.—This confounded gout has kept me in continual alarm, or else she should have spoke for herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then does not Hardy bring her up to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why for two very sufficient reasons:—in the first place, that identical parson paid him the last compliment, that is, buried him, a twelvemonth ago; and in the second, they would hardly entrust her to any man but him who deliver'd her to them.—Here was a girl, my Lord, to support your title, of which I dare swear you are as fond as ever: she would have brought you a race of true Britons; instead of which, from the painted dolls and unjointed Macaronies of these days, we shall produce our own enemies, and have a race of Frenchmen born in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank your <HI>intention,</HI> brother; but am far from wishing the chief accomplishments of Wood∣ville's Lady should be the making <HI>cream cheeses, goats whey,</HI> and <HI>alder wine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell your Lordship, women were never better than when those <HI>were</HI> their chief accom∣plishments.—But I may be ridiculous my own way, without being singular.—<HI>Harcourt</HI> shall have my girl, and my money too.—Cream cheeses, quotha? no, no, making cream <HI>faces</HI> is an accomplishment which the belles of these days oftener excel in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I would not advise you to publish this opinion, Governor!</P>

<P>Well, well, man! you are young enough to trust to time, and he does wonders.—Don't go now and ruin yourself with your uncle;—I have found him out already, and advertise you, none of your formal obsequious bows and respectful assents will do with him; having been cheated in former times of half his fortune by a parasite, he mistrusts ev'ry one, and always mistakes politeness for servility.

<P>No, Woodville! that was, when innocent, as far above my hopes, as it is now beyond my wishes.—I love you too sincerely to reap any advan∣tage from so generous an error; yet you at once flatter and wound my heart, in allowing me worthy such a distinction: but love cannot subsist without esteem; and how should I possess yours when I have lost even my own?</P>

As a proof of my sincerity, I will own I doubted your right to that mark, of his esteem, and made this trial in con∣sequence. Pleas'd to find you worthy of his rank, I feel shock'd at reminding you, you ought not to share it. But, madam, if you truly love him, you cannot wish that, to be just to you, he should be unjust to those who have a prior right over him.—This shall positively be my last effort.

<P>A motive like your's, sir, will excuse any thing. How little my happiness, honour, or interest, <HI>ever</HI> weighed against his, need not be repeated. Far be it from me <HI>now</HI> to disgrace him; he is apprized of my invincible objections to a match which will never

<P>You may laugh, madam, but I am serious; and a fine girl she is: and to shew you I have not read Chesterfield in vain, I have robb'd my dearest friend of her; in plain English, Woodville has a mistress he doats on so madly, as even to intend mar∣rying her.—Imagining her, like most of her stamp, only an artful and interested creature, I paid her a visit as a stranger, with an offer which must have un∣veil'd her heart, had it been base:—but I found her, on the contrary, a truly noble-minded girl, and far above her present situation; which she earnestly wishes to quit.—In short, my dear, I thought it prudent to part them; and, in your name, offered her an asy∣lum.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is that cruel argument perpetuates error in so many of your frail sex: be the first to rise above it. That you are in Lord Glenmore's house, will be your justification, both to the world and himself: for, what but the design of serving him and his son can actuate you? In my eyes, my dear Sophia, virtue never looks so lovely as when she stretches out her hand to the fallen.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not to learn, that friendship and love have been mere masks to fraud and folly in the great world; no one would blame me, were I to suffer Woodville to ruin himself, as the shortest way of fixing my own fortune, and obtaining my Lord's ap∣probation of your choice. But, I know not how it happened, that, when a mere boy, I took it into my head, truth was as much to the purpose as lying; and, as I never got into more scrapes than others, why I still pursue my system, and prefer honour to art.

<P>Brother! do not judge 'till you know her! and give me leave to tell you, these prejudices of your temper will render you very ridiculous.</P>

<P>I shall never have patience. My head is just now full of something too important, to examine which of us is most in the wrong. I am fixed on removing this ambitious minx of my son's for ever out his reach immediately. Will you oblige me with the company of your servants?

<P>For years did she increase in goodness as in beauty; the charm of ev'ry young heart, and the sole comfort of those old ones, to whom heav'n and man seem'd to have consign'd her for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; I had a little bird told me all this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grey.</SPEAKER>
<P>About a twelvemonth ago, during a little absence of mine, a young man of fashion introduced himself into my house; and, my wife being void of suspicion, and the dear girl uninstructed in the ways of this bad world,—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="56"/>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dog betray'd her?—and is this your care, you old—and that ignoramus, your wife—zounds! I am in such a fury!—I want to know no more of her infamous conduct.—Od! I am strangely tempted to have you strangled this moment, as a just reward for your negligence; and so bury the secret with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is as effectually buried already, Sir.—I love the dear unhappy girl too well, ever to tell her heav'n gave her to such a father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes;—you are better suited to the—I hope she pays for this severely!—you make her stand in a white sheet, to be pointed at by the whole village ev'ry Sunday, to be sure?</P>

<P>Alas, Sir, she put it out of my power even to forgive her.—</P>

<P>Forgive her! forgive her truly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grey.</SPEAKER>
<P>By flying immediately from her only friend.—infirm and poor, I struggled with the joint-evils till now; when, having collected enough to support me, I walk'd up in search of her:—it was only yes∣terday I discover'd her in a splendid coach, which I traced to her house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>A <HI>house,</HI> I shall run mad entirely—a <HI>coach?</HI>—why dare the little brazen-face pretend to elegance, when I took such pains to quench ev'ry spark of gen∣tility in her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grey.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the nighbourhood I discover'd the name of her seducer; and, in seeking him, met with you.—Moderate your passion, Sir,—reflect! when age is frail, what can we expect in youth?—shall man desert humanity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="57"/>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so, so; now I am to be tortur'd with your preaching.—I renounce the unworthy little slut.—I have no friend,—no daughter,—no any thing;—od! I would sooner build an hospital for ideots, like Swift, and endow it with all my fortune, than bestow it on one who thus perverts reason:—hark ye, Sir,—forget the way to this house I—forget you ever saw my face!—would I had never seen your's!—for, if you dare to send her whining to me, I'll torment you with ev'ry plague, power, wealth, law, or even lawyers can set in motion—by heav'n, I abjure the audacious little wretch for ever! and will sooner return to India and bury my gold with those from whom it was taken, than bestow a single shilling on her, when she loses her <HI>coach</HI> and her <HI>house.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grey.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Contemptuously)</STAGE>
And I will sooner want a a shilling, than suffer her to waste her youth in a state which will render her age an unsupportable burden. Fear not, Sir, ever seeing <HI>her</HI> or <HI>me</HI> again; for the bosom which rear'd will joyfully receive her, nor further embitter her remaining days with the know∣ledge she was born the equal of her undoer; and de∣priv'd herself of all those blessings heav'n only <HI>hid,</HI> never denied her.

of fashion, the papers will get hold of it, and I shall be paragraphed into purgatory.—Fools can turn wits on these occasions; and "a certain Governor and his daughter," will set the grinners in motion from Piccadilly to Aldgate.—This insolent old fellow too!—I need not wonder where she got courage!—not but I like his spirit,—od!

<P>Astonishment and pleasure leave me hardly power to say, that a disobedience to you, sir, would only double my fault: nor to worship that Heav'n, which has led me through such a trial to such a re∣ward!—take all I have left myself to give you, Woodville, in my hand—
<STAGE>(Woodville <HI>kisses first her hand, and then herself</HI>)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Grey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, let me die, my darling child! since I have seen thee, once more, innocent and happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, kiss me, my Cecilia!—kiss me!—od, Miss Mortimer shall kiss me too, for loving my poor girl here!—kiss me, all of you, old and young!—men, women and children!—od, I am so overjoy'd, I dread the consequences.—D'ye hear, there?—fetch me a surgeon and a bottle of wine!—I must both empty and fill my veins on this occasion—zooks, I could find in my heart to frisk it merrily in defiance of the gout, and take that cursed vixen be∣low, whoever she is, for my partner!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks all seem rewarded, but my poor Sophia here? and her protection of Cecilia deserves the highest recompence: but whenever, my dear, you can present me the husband of your choice, I will present him with a fortune fit for my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Protect Cecilia! od! she is a good girl, and a charming girl, and I honour the very tip of her feathers now!—if she could but fancy our Charles,
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
I'd throw in something pretty on his side, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Mor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frankness is the fashion.—What would you say, Sir, and you, my Lord, if I <HI>had</HI> fan∣cied your Charles so much, as to make him mine already?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! more discov'ries! how's this, boy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so, Sir, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Glen.</SPEAKER>
<P>It completes my satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Od, brother! who'd have thought you in the right all the while—we'll never separate again, by the Lord Harry! but knock down our Welch friend's old house; and raise him one on the ruins, large enough to contain the whole family of us, where he shall reign sole sov'reign over all our future little Woodvilles and Cecilias.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oppressed with wonder, pleasure, gratitude, I must endeavour to forgive <HI>myself,</HI> when heav'n thus graciously proves its forgiveness, in allying me to ev'ry human being my heart distinguishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Cecilia, you may believe <HI>him,</HI> who never gave you a bad lesson, that you are now most truly entitled to esteem; since it requires a far greater exertion to stop your course down the hill of vice, than to toil slowly up toward virtue.</P>
