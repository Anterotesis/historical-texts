<HEAD>ELEGY, TO THE MEMORY OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM, late EARL of BATH.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>SAY, when the wise, the dignify'd, and high</L>
<L>Submit to fate's inexorable doom,</L>
<L>Shall no kind anguish swell the friendly eye,</L>
<L>Nor drop one pious off'ring on the tomb?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Ere this some vot'ry of poetic fame</L>
<L>'Twas thought, o BATH! had kindled into fire,</L>
<L>And wreath'd a deathless chaplet for thy name</L>
<L>Around the muse's consecrated lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Yet this dead silence which the muse displays</L>
<L>From friendship's self may possibly arise;</L>
<L>Since all, though bound to wonder and to praise,</L>
<L>Are bound alike to pity and despise.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>O that DEATH's dread and everlasting pause,</L>
<L>In black oblivion might enwrap thy name,</L>
<L>So that the loss of honour and applause</L>
<L>Could wash away thy baseness and thy shame!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>But truth, alas! will rush beyond the grave,</L>
<L>And drag the mightiest to the face of morn,</L>
<L>Dwell on each act that indicates the slave,</L>
<L>And hang it up to never-ending scorn.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis then, no bawd of overbearing times,</L>
<L>Howe'er entrench'd in ermine, or in pow'r,</L>
<L>Can strain her honest dictates into crimes,</L>
<L>Nor legal ruffian haul her to the tow'r;</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis then, no dastard verdict she can hear,</L>
<L>On some tame jury villainously stole,</L>
<L>Nor dread a sentence fasten'd on their fear,</L>
<L>Repugnant wholly to their sense and soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Had the white angel of the strictly just,</L>
<L>At one nice period, PULTNEY, interpos'd,</L>
<L>And kindly snatch'd thee headlong into dust,</L>
<L>How bright a race of glory hadst thou clos'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Then, at thy mention, the big drop would start,</L>
<L>And teach each nobler sentiment to burn;</L>
<L>All BRITAIN then had screw'd thee to her heart,</L>
<L>And pour'd immortal sorrows on thy urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>The nameless magic on thy voice which hung</L>
<L>Had then swell'd up our most exalted rhymes,</L>
<L>And the rich thunders of thy wondrous tongue</L>
<L>Roll'd on impetuous to the latest times.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Turn back, o memory! if thou canst, nor gaze</L>
<L>Where poor ambition's paltry-minded breath</L>
<L>Could blast the harvest of so bright a praise,</L>
<L>And chill each rip'ning dignity to death.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>Throw some Olympus, fancy, on the thought,</L>
<L>Nor let the bursting sentiment disclose,</L>
<L>That patriot PULTNEY ever could be bought</L>
<L>To screen the deadliest of his country's foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>That he, the godlike guardian of the state,</L>
<L>Who still pursu'd where'er the villain fled,</L>
<L>Could basely stoop and snatch him from his fate</L>
<L>When hung with honest horrors o'er his head.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>And stoop—for what?—Perdition catch the sound,</L>
<L>And blast it instant, with the worst despair!</L>
<L>A word which truth, in ev'ry age, has found</L>
<L>Compos'd as much of infamy as air.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>Search the long list of nobles on record,</L>
<L>Since empire first or dignity began,</L>
<L>And mark how few were honour'd with MY LORD,</L>
<L>Who grac'd the humbler epithet of MAN.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>In nature's earlier and exalted state</L>
<L>On sure foundations all distinction stood;</L>
<L>Whoe'er had worth, of consequence, was great,</L>
<L>And he was self-ennobl'd, that was — GOOD.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>No star then glitter'd on the breast of shame,</L>
<L>No sordid knave was purpled o'er with strings;</L>
<L>'Twas worth that mark'd a subject with a name,</L>
<L>And not the wild capriciousness of kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>But, when some spoiler, rushing into light,</L>
<L>The bolts of pow'r tyrannically hurl'd,</L>
<L>And claim'd from heav'n hereditary right</L>
<L>To scourge the groaning nations of the world!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>When future kings, in one oppressive line,</L>
<L>On ev'ry human institute had trod;</L>
<L>Nay, talk'd of rights prescriptively divine,</L>
<L>To burst the dreadest mandates of their God:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>Then the mad licence of unbounded rule,</L>
<L>A <HI>brand</HI> of title to it's minions gave,</L>
<L>Stamp'd the <HI>disgrace</HI> of honour on the fool,</L>
<L>The public robber, and the perjur'd slave.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>The blushless villain bore it, from the hour</L>
<L>He vilely sold his country and his trust:</L>
<L>The hackney'd strumpet had it for her dower,</L>
<L>And reek'd a Duchess from the bed of lust.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>Yet, for this breath of dignify'd disgrace,</L>
<L>Did PULTNEY meanly pandar to a throne;</L>
<L>Nay, though it stunk upon a WALPOLE's race,</L>
<L>Before it rankly fester'd on his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Here see, ye meteors of a wondring state!</L>
<L>Nor throw the moral sentiment aside,</L>
<L>How low, ambition can reduce the great,</L>
<L>And how the wisest are debas'd by pride!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>O did a puff of title-giving wind</L>
<L>Point out to man a more exalted goal,</L>
<L>Enlarge the smallest faculty of mind,</L>
<L>Or raise the simplest excellence of soul:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>Did the loud herald's widely-swelling strain,</L>
<L>The pompous coat, or coronetted crest,</L>
<L>Talk down the mad'ning anguish of a pain,</L>
<L>Or hush a rising sorrow in the breast:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>Could this ennobling quality of kings</L>
<L>Eternal rounds of happiness bestow;</L>
<L>Pluck out from guilt it's never-dying stings,</L>
<L>And purge the midnight murderer to snow:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="27">
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>XXVII.</HEAD>
<L>Then, e'en the basest, possibly, might rise,</L>
<L>The boast and wonder of applauding times;</L>
<L>And heav'n, which saw the greatness of the prize,</L>
<L>Look down, perhaps, in mercy on his crimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="28">
<HEAD>XXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>But when we see, in pond'ring on the great,</L>
<L>The bloating glories of a monarch's breath</L>
<L>Can sooth no adverse circumstance of fate,</L>
<L>Nor kindly steal a manacle on death,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="29">
<HEAD>XXIX.</HEAD>
<L>When the long scene of tinsel has been clos'd,</L>
<L>Which through unnumber'd ancestries has ran;</L>
<L>And left the mightiest of the high expos'd</L>
<L>To all the various miseries of man:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="30">
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>XXX.</HEAD>
<L>When we behold him languidly oppress'd,</L>
<L>On death's pale couch, all ghastly and declin'd;</L>
<L>Or dragg'd before the godhead of his breast,</L>
<L>And damn'd to all the hells within his mind:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="31">
<HEAD>XXXI.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis then th'intrinsic emptiness of fame,</L>
<L>In all it's pomp of nothingness, shall rise;</L>
<L>Teach wisdom's cheek to redden at a name,</L>
<L>And virtue's brow to furrow and despise.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="32">
<HEAD>XXXII.</HEAD>
<L>Titles! — what are ye, on your noblest strings,</L>
<L>Howe'er the weak, or worthless, may revere?</L>
<L>Alas! the proudest epithet of kings</L>
<L>Ne'er struck, like BARNARD, on a British ear!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="33">
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>XXXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Where inbred honour happily is given,</L>
<L>In vain the stream of dignity is shed;</L>
<L>And sure 'tis treason at the bar of heaven</L>
<L>To pour a glory on a rascal's head.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="34">
<HEAD>XXXIV.</HEAD>
<L>See, low in earth, where PULTNEY's title lies,</L>
<L>That glittering gewgaw of a prince's nod:</L>
<L>While BARNARD holds a patent from the skies,</L>
<L>And soars a deathless nobleman with God!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="35">
<HEAD>XXXV.</HEAD>
<L>Here thrones, enwrap'd in silence and amaze,</L>
<L>Shall shrink to look so wonderfully high;</L>
<L>And fame herself be furnish'd with a gaze</L>
<L>To crack the straining fibres of her eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="36">
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>XXXVI.</HEAD>
<L>Hear, ye mad factions of the present race,</L>
<L>Who wildly rage with discord's dang'rous brand,</L>
<L>And call a shameless enmity for place</L>
<L>A gen'rous struggle for your native land!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="37">
<HEAD>XXXVII.</HEAD>
<L>But chiefly hear, ye celebrated few,</L>
<L>Who <HI>nobly</HI> sicken at a country's groan,</L>
<L>And, acting <HI>always</HI> from the whitest view,</L>
<L>Have fought from honest principle alone!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="38">
<HEAD>XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>Is there, who, glowing with a godlike pride,</L>
<L>For BARNARD's crown would emulously start,</L>
<L>And spurn the farce of dignity aside</L>
<L>To raise an empire on a nation's heart?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="39">
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>XXXIX.</HEAD>
<L>Let star-ey'd justice ever be his rule,</L>
<L>Which all of <HI>self</HI> indignantly disowns;</L>
<L>And scorns as much to be a party's tool</L>
<L>As crouch the servile sycophant of thrones.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="40">
<HEAD>XL.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis not a blind ungovernable rage</L>
<L>At every act which ministers avow,</L>
<L>That justly marks the saviour of an age,</L>
<L>Or binds a laurel round the patriot brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="41">
<HEAD>XLI.</HEAD>
<L>The keenest scourge that ever smote these climes,</L>
<L>At some nice crisis for their welfare stood:</L>
<L>And oft the mere necessity of times</L>
<L>Has scar'd the ruthless tyrant into good —</L>
</LG>
<LG N="42">
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>XLII.</HEAD>
<L>Though hapless AFRIC at her fires exclaims</L>
<L>While mid-day suns their blazing circuit hold;</L>
<L>Yet the same orb that lights her into flames</L>
<L>Matures the latent mineral to gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="43">
<HEAD>XLIII.</HEAD>
<L>The parching natives of the baleful shore</L>
<L>At eve's glad summons dart themselves away,</L>
<L>And grasp, transported, at the dazzling ore,</L>
<L>Though ripen'd solely by the burning day:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="44">
<HEAD>XLIV.</HEAD>
<L>Just so the patriot, of an honest zeal,</L>
<L>Swift as the light'ning vehemently wings,</L>
<L>And grasps each measure for the public weal,</L>
<L>Without once thinking from what source it springs.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="45">
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
<HEAD>XLV.</HEAD>
<L>But why of patriots idly do I rave? —</L>
<L>My inmost soul the modern herd disdains,</L>
<L>Where every boaster has his turn of slave</L>
<L>And vilely bawds to shackle us in chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="46">
<HEAD>XLVI.</HEAD>
<L>Loud as the leaders of our patriot band</L>
<L>The public shout of liberty may claim,</L>
<L>Yet base proscription blackens every hand</L>
<L>And stabs a kingdom, to preserve the GAME.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="47">
<HEAD>XLVII.</HEAD>
<L>What boots the casual vehemence of soul,</L>
<L>That swells the freeborn whirlwind to the skies,</L>
<L>Rings against GEN'RAL WARRANTS at the pole,</L>
<L>And chills the stars with curses at EXCISE:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="48">
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>XLVIII.</HEAD>
<L>If, while the cause of liberty they plead</L>
<L>Our very patriots infamously fall,</L>
<L>And stoop themselves to consecrate a deed</L>
<L>Which drags the widest ruin on us all?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="49">
<HEAD>XLIX.</HEAD>
<L>What are the new-born suff'rings of the hour</L>
<L>If justice takes the balance in her hand,</L>
<L>To what the mean barbarity of pow'r</L>
<L>In brutal GAME-ACTS scatters round the land?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="50">
<HEAD>L.</HEAD>
<L>Strip'd of his rights, the farmer seeks the shade,</L>
<L>Where silence kindly waits upon despair;</L>
<L>And mourns his sacred liberties betray'd,</L>
<L>That pamper'd wealth may trifle with a hare.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="51">
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>LI.</HEAD>
<L>To grief and rage alternately he yields,</L>
<L>Nor sheds one grateful smile upon the morn;</L>
<L>A gen'ral ravage wastes his little fields,</L>
<L>And speaks some purse-proud ruffian of the horn.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="52">
<HEAD>LII.</HEAD>
<L>Perhaps, a bleeding monument he stands,</L>
<L>To strike his neighb'ring villagers with awe;</L>
<L>And smarts, all scourg'd by LEGISLATIVE hands,</L>
<L>Who greatly club to ROB him of the LAW —</L>
</LG>
<LG N="53">
<HEAD>LIII.</HEAD>
<L>But at our MINORS let him not exclaim,</L>
<L>Nor turn to heav'n his melancholy eyes:</L>
<L>A patriot, sure, may murder for the GAME</L>
<L>Who damns a GEN'RAL WARRANT and EXCISE!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="54">
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
<HEAD>LIV.</HEAD>
<L>Weep not, ye RUSSIAN vassals! at your state,</L>
<L>Nor think your lot is singularly hard;</L>
<L>Though mark'd, through some severity of fate,</L>
<L>A kind of pack-horse to your casual lord:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="55">
<HEAD>LV.</HEAD>
<L>What, though beneath the everlasting breeze,</L>
<L>With scarce a pittance of the meanest bread,</L>
<L>Through life's long round you miserably freeze,</L>
<L>And none e'er find a shelter, but the dead:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="56">
<HEAD>LVI.</HEAD>
<L>Yet fate, in all it's bitterness, was kind,</L>
<L>And shew'd some marks of tenderness and care;</L>
<L>Bestow'd a bless'd unthinkingness of mind,</L>
<L>And gave a happy promptitude to bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="57">
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>LVII.</HEAD>
<L>You can sit naked in the beating rain,</L>
<L>E'en while the north wind violently roars;</L>
<L>And seem regardless while the bellowing main</L>
<L>In horror dashes round your dreary shores:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="58">
<HEAD>LVIII.</HEAD>
<L>You, at a nod, can prostitute a wife,</L>
<L>Nor doubt the killing mandate to be just;</L>
<L>Can calmly kneel, and sacrifice a life,</L>
<L>To lick the foot that tramples you in dust. —</L>
</LG>
<LG N="59">
<HEAD>LIX.</HEAD>
<L>But BRITONS, form'd of very diff'rent mould,</L>
<L>At ev'ry touch intuitively smart;</L>
<L>And, greatly just, as generously bold,</L>
<L>The smallest dagger pierces to the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="60">
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
<HEAD>LX.</HEAD>
<L>How then must BRITONS murmur at their fate,</L>
<L>If candid sense decides upon the cause;</L>
<L>When ev'n the mere AMUSEMENTS of the great</L>
<L>Can stab the VITAL ESSENCE of our LAWS?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="61">
<HEAD>LXI.</HEAD>
<L>When ev'n the hand of LEGISLATIVE rule,</L>
<L>Which once stood guardian at distress's door,</L>
<L>Extends the pow'r of ev'ry WEALTHY fool,</L>
<L>And nobly makes it GUILTY to be POOR?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="62">
<HEAD>LXII.</HEAD>
<L>O for some curse, executive as dread!</L>
<L>Hot, hissing instant, from the starry throne,</L>
<L>To strike the villain's execrable head,</L>
<L>That first destroy'd our TITLE to our OWN!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="63">
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>LXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Will no kind thunder pity the distress'd,</L>
<L>And, big with judgment, mercifully roll,</L>
<L>To crush his <HI>more</HI> than PROSTITUTED breast;</L>
<L>To blast — his actual SODOMY of soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="64">
<HEAD>LXIV.</HEAD>
<L>Ye patriot names! — But, why should I persist —</L>
<L>'Tis vain with pride or av'rice to contend —</L>
<L>Besides, few BARNARDS beam upon the list,</L>
<L>And, all too like, may PULTNEY in the end.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="65">
<HEAD>LXV.</HEAD>
<L>O PULTNEY! — But comparison is pain,</L>
<L>Where BARNARD's name we mention as divine,</L>
<L>And fancy only aggravates the stain</L>
<L>Which BATH has thrown eternally on thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="66">
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>LXVI.</HEAD>
<L>The praise of worlds, in echo to the spheres,</L>
<L>The patriot's brightest and his best reward;</L>
<L>And all that once could ravish on our ears</L>
<L>Is now absorb'd in infamy and LORD.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="67">
<HEAD>LXVII.</HEAD>
<L>Yet let us teach the ages still unborn</L>
<L>With some indulgence kindly to decide,</L>
<L>And think that fate has cast thee out to scorn</L>
<L>To lash each swelling arrogance of pride:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="68">
<HEAD>LXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>Let us suppose thee graciously design'd</L>
<L>To give one moral lesson to the ball;</L>
<L>And teach the proudest of the human kind</L>
<L>How soon the wisest and the mightiest fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="69">
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
<HEAD>LXIX.</HEAD>
<L>Then on the wing of widely spreading fame</L>
<L>Some tender mark of pity may be thrown;</L>
<L>And those who blush the deepest at thy name,</L>
<L>Turn back, dismay'd, and tremble for their own.</L>
