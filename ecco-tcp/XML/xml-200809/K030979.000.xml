<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BEFORE this court our Authoress you'll allow,</L>
<L>Must feel—a simile shall tell you how—</L>
<L>And doing what good squires wou'd do of course,</L>
<L>Compare we thus our Lady to a horse.</L>
<L>Suppose some pony then, of make and blood,</L>
<L>In jockey phrase, a little bit but good;</L>
<L>Who, beating all competitors in pace,</L>
<L>Had won the whip of many a country race;</L>
<L>Urg'd by its master, or the love of gain,</L>
<L>Should this our poney seek Newmarket's plain.</L>
<L>How soon might all its little honours fade,</L>
<L>Sunk on "The Flats," or sticking in "Choak-jade."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fancy Newmarket then the scene you see,</L>
<L>You are "the knowing ones" the pony she—</L>
<L>Has she not then well-founded cause to dread—</L>
<L>Speak, would ye bet the odds upon her head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, simile apart, the fact is this,</L>
<L>The day has been she has not done amiss;</L>
<L>But praise has made her tim'rous more than vain,</L>
<L>And late success augments the present pain.</L>
<L>A woman—there's indulgence in the name—</L>
<L>A widow too—that gives a stronger claim.</L>
<L>If she should fall, she falls as women do,</L>
<L>"Like stars," successful she may rise anew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Ladies, sure, will not their aid withdraw,</L>
<L>Whose smile is triumph, and whose looks are law.</L>
<L>The Beaux—if wits there are among such men—</L>
<L>May gladly claim acquaintance with her pen.</L>
<L>Some Bard, perhaps, who thrives by opposition,</L>
<L>Might form a kind of scribbling coalition.</L>
<L>Her aid, in odes, probationary cite,</L>
<L>—Those odes, which Poets-laureat never write;</L>
<L>Whose soft court small-talk flows in numbers bland▪</L>
<L>And greatly sports at question and command—</L>
<L>Here law, with open hand and ready mouth,</L>
<L>There Scotch, that never reach'd beyond the South.</L>
<L>Great Indian names, that mock articulation,</L>
<L>And Irish wit, of English fabrication.</L>
<L>If Wit and Beauty then for us write,</L>
<L>Who will deny their powerful aid to-night.—</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Will you, gay Gods, refuse your broad-brim'd smile,</L>
<L>From painted skies, and stars of patent oil;</L>
<L>Or you, who boast below a snugger birth,</L>
<L>Ye midway Deities 'twixt heaven and earth—</L>
<L>I see you're kind—our thanks are due for that;</L>
<L>I find you've not forgot—"I'll tell you what."</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Miss ANGLE <HI>and</HI> FISH <HI>discovered.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE's somebody at the door, Fish—'tis Lady Mary Magpie—let her in—even her ridiculous vanity is more supportable than the reflection on my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Mary, ma'am. <STAGE>(Opens the door.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lady MARY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good-morrow, dear Lady Mary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, sit still—and, Mrs. Fish, do you stay.—I have brought something to shew your mistress, and you may see it too, if she will give you leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.—Fish, you may stay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There! <STAGE>(Opening a shawl.)</STAGE> What do you think of that?—A present from Mr. Walmsley—a shawl, worth at a moderate va∣luation, no less than a hundred and fifty guineas.—He gave it me this minute—it came over but last night from India—has been on the seas seven months—was in that terrible storm of October last.—Little did I think, when I heard of those dreadful wrecks, and the many souls that perished, that I had a shawl at sea: if I had, I should have suffered a martyrdom!—Now is not it pretty?—Beautiful?—He assures me, his correspondent writes him word, "There is but one more such in all India."—And I'm to wear it the first time on my wedding-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very beautiful indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't you well, my dear?—You don't seem to understand it's value.—What do you say to it, Mrs. Fish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh madam!—I like it of all things!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say you do.—But come, my dear Miss Angle, what's the matter with you? Since you first came to town, you are the most altered creature I ever saw!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship does not think my mistress has lost any of her beauty, I hope?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for that, Mrs. Fish, I dare say your Lady has made observation enough to know, that beauty is of little weight here;—
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
of no signification at all!—Beauty in London is so cheap, and consequently so common to the men of fashion, (who are prodigiously fond of novelty) that they absolutely begin to fall in love with the ugly women, by way of change.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And does your Ladyship think old women will ever come into fashion?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are in fashion—they have been in fashion some time.—Girls, and young women, have made themselves so cheap, they are quite out.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so.— <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as the vulgar lay hold of any thing, the people of ton leave it off.—Such is the case with young women.—The vulgar have laid hold of them, and they are quite out.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear me!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But come, my dear Angle, pluck up your spirits, against you know when—you are to be one of my bridemaids you know—Oh how I long to be away from lodgings, and in a house of my own—Mr. Walmsley says, he shall invite you to stay a day or two with us.—He likes you (stranger as you are to us both) very much I assure you.—He is a great admirer of virtue, in us females; and, notwithstanding his little oddities, would do any thing for a wo∣man of character; and your refusing that vile Lord's odious addresses (which I inform'd him of) has interested him for you exceedingly.
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
Well, heaven bless you—I can't stay—he'll be quite impatient. <STAGE>(Going)</STAGE> I may tell him you like the shawl I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beautiful, beyond measure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you, Mrs. Fish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming, ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I tell you there was but one more such in all India? <STAGE>(Coming back.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only think of it's being in that storm! <STAGE>(Exit.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I had been in the storm, and had fallen it's victim!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Fish, that woman's non∣sense, at which you laugh'd, was graced with sentiments of the strictest truth!—Young women are no longer thought of here.—How rashly did I give credit to our foolish country people!—They told me, that, "Tho' only admired by them, in London I shou'd be adored—that beau∣ty here was rare—that virtue"—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, madam, and that is rare, every body knows!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it valued?—No.—As soon as I gave Lord Lighthead proofs of my pos∣sessing it, what was the consequence?—I have neither seen nor heard of him since.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very odd!—For my part I thought him so much in love!—And sometimes I thought you looked a little.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I felt a warmth—a some∣thing like tenderness for him, I own; but that it was the effect of love I will not pretend to say—It was perhaps the effect of hope—Pride too, had a great share in the agitation of my heart—and gratitude might have confirm'd the whole sensation love.—But, in the moment gratitude shou'd have been inspired, resentment, indignation, took possession—and I am now left solely to shame and disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!—it's very odd that a man should give himself so much trouble to come here after you, so many times as he did, and then all of a sudden never to come near you for a whole month.—I should not mind losing him, neither, if some duke or other great man would come instead of him; or even that strange young man we met on the road, as we came to town, and that was so kind to us when our chaise broke down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honest creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, as sure as ever I was in love in my life, that young man and his servant were both as deep in love—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>With me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: the master with you, and the man with me.—But we, I thought, were coming to town to make our fortune, and so I was above
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
making it on the road.—For notwithstanding that young man looked so countrified, and had hardly a word to say for himself, he's worth thousands!—And poor Humphry, his servant, persuaded me to give him our direction; that his master and he might come after us to London—And yet, to see the fickleness of man! we have heard nor seen nothing of them.—But, dear ma∣dam, his Lordship runs most in my head—Per∣haps he is sick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—he visits the drawing∣room, constantly; as we read in the papers.—I wonder what he wou'd say if he was accidentally to meet me?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>He'd fall in love with you as much as ever.—Suppose, madam, you was to write to him?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, I know a few lines from you wou'd cheer his heart, and he would be as dying for you as ever!—Oh! when I have giv∣en him a letter from you, how he has jumped for joy! how he has kiss'd it! and how he has kiss'd me!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'd I write to him with any appearance of prudence—for instance; upon any business—I shou'd have no objection: it wou'd at least remind him of me, and bring matters to a decision.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then do, madam, contrive to write to him about some business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What business can I pretend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam! if you had a handsome piece of silk for a gown, or a diamond pin, or something of that kind, you might return it him back again.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Return it him again! What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, madam, you might send it him back—as if you had received the present from a person unknown: and concluding that it <HI>must</HI> come from his Lordship, you had thought proper to return it—and so you might send him, with it, a fine long virtuous letter, that "you wou'd not re∣ceive a present from a king, that had evil de∣signs upon you," and so on—and so on—and so on.—This, I am sure would make him ten times fonder of you than ever—for he would think some rival had been sending you the present in that anonymous manner, which had made you think it was him—and I know he wou'd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest there is something in that scheme which pleases me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do it, madam—do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can I?—I have no∣thing of value—nothing that I cou'd suppose he wou'd send for a present, and which I could think of consequence enough to return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's your watch, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An old fashion'd thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! I have thought of something! The finest thing!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Mary Magpie's shawl—You known ma'am, 'tis the finest thing in the world—There is but one more such in all the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the shawl is not mine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No ma'am—but I dare say I know where her ladyship has laid it, and I can get it.</P>
<STAGE>(Going to the door.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, do you think I'd steal it—It cou'd do it no harm to be a few hours at his Lordship's—He'd send it back directly: you may depend upon that—And then such a fine thing?—It would make him think that some great man indeed had taken a fancy to you—and he'd be so afraid of losing you.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!—I protest—if I thought—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can get it, ma'am, with all the ease in the world—I dare say. <STAGE>(Runs out.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will become of me?—Where will my folly end?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> FISH.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—yes—ma'am, I can get it—her Ladyship has spread it on the bed in the blue chamber, and is gone out for the whole even∣ing;
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
and will sleep at her cousin's, Lady Beach's—her maid told me so in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose his Lordship should not return it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laud ma'am! do you think his Lord∣ship will keep it, when he'll know he did not send it you?—His Lordship is not a thief, I sup∣pose—You'll have it back, ma'am, I'll answer for it in an hour or two, and himself with it.—The person shan't leave it ma'am, if his Lord∣ship is not at home; and then you'll be sure to have it in an hour or two—I'll go steal it—I'll go steal it. <STAGE>(Going.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Steal it!—</P>

<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take it, ma'am—not steal it. <STAGE>(Exit.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>This scheme will at least renew our acquaintance—and that is all I want—for if, on the renewal, he appears cold, I will leave Lon∣don instantly—if, on the contrary, he is as much in love as ever—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>FISH</HI> with the Shawl.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FISH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have got it—I have got it—here it is.—Now, madam, come into your bed cham∣ber and write a very affecting letter, while I do it up, and send for a porter.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest I am frighten'd—tho' we take it but to return again.</P>

<P>Dear madam, I hear Mr. Walmsley's voice—my Lord's uncle, madam!—they are coming here—what shall we do, ma∣dam?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGHTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What vices, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you are a fellow that falls in love with every face you see; and yet admire your own more than any one of them.—You are a man whose purse is open to every gambler and courtezan, and is never shut, but to objects of real distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGHTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how are you informed of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear it!—told of it by every body!—Do you think any thing but conviction would have forced me to the rash step I have taken?—Wou'd any thing but a certainty that you were unworthy to be my heir, have forced
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
me to the desperate resolution of marrying, notwithstanding my natural aversion to opposi∣tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGHTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, when you marry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hope! Pshaw!—I know well enough what marriage is—'Tis a poesy of thorns—nobody knows where to lay hold of it—'Tis a stormy sea, where nothing is to be expected but squalls, tempests and shipwrecks!—One cries, "Help"—another, "Lord have mercy upon us"—a third, "'Tis all over with us"—and souse they all go into the ocean of calamity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGHTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, for heaven's sake, Sir, if this is your opinion, decline your intention of marrying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't—'tis too late—my word is pass'd—Your indiscretions put me in a pas∣sion, and I took a rash step!—a step I never intended to take.—I offered a lady to marry her, in the heat of anger, and she took me at my word, before I had time to grow cool and re∣cant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGHTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How unfortunate!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not aware she would be so sudden!—but I was in such a violent passion;—all against you for your follies—I was de∣vilish hot! I don't remember that I was ever in such a heat in my life! I strutted—and fretted—and walk'd—and talk'd—all in anger against
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
you; which she took for love to her, and so was overcome in less than ten minutes.</P>

<P>Why, then, I should have broken every bone in your skin!—But as it was—I vented my rage—in kissing the lady; and won her heart without farther trouble.—It's impossi∣ble I could have won her so soon, but by my being in that violent rage; for she's a particular, prudent, discreet, reserv'd, middle-aged wo∣man; and nothing but my great violence cou'd have had that effect upon her.</P>

<P>I own, Sir, I have been very unfortunate as to Appearances—Appearances, and those alone, have been the ruin of my re∣putation;—accidents so strange, that no human wisdom cou'd prevent or avoid them—I have been found, for instance, with a female, whom I never had the smallest familiarity with, in the most suspicious situations; and only by mere accident.—</P>

<P>Yes, upon my word, Sir, that was an accident—entirely an accident—My servant had just lost me a favorite spaniel, and, had the rascal been in the way, I shou'd have broken every bone in his skin; but, hap∣pening to meet with this poor girl, I vented my rage on her.</P>

<P>I am at a loss how to accuse this man, tho' I am sure either he or his master is guilty. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Mr. Humphry, I am very sorry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Honour!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, I am very sorry—very sorry, indeed—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Madam, never be sorry about it.—For my part, I should hardly have found it out, if I had not been told of it.—Besides, nobody has any thing to do with it, but yourself;—and if they had, you are such a good companion <STAGE>(Looking at his money)</STAGE> nobody can be angry with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?—No cross-purposes—but answer me directly.—Do you know any thing of my shawl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your what, Ma'am?—Your shawl? Ha, ha, ha, ha!—Oh! you'll have a fine head∣ach for this to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY,</SPEAKER>
<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not be so ill as you'll be for five guineas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fellow is laughing at me!—Fish, call a constable; I'll have him taken up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take me up!—Lord, Ma'am, do you lie down—only for half an hour—only just for half an hour—you can't think how refresh'd you'll be.—It will clear all this away; <STAGE>(Point∣ing to his head)</STAGE> and you'll be quite another wo∣man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I know a nap is of vast consequence to me, at these times—especially when my liquor makes me ill-tempered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The man's mad—I'll have him secured directly.—Call a constable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, your Honour, let me per∣suade you to take a bason of camomile tea.—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Miss ANGLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Angle, come hither.—Did you ever hear such an insult?—Fish—Fish—Call all the people of the house.—Who's there? Come and secure this robber.—My an∣ger is rouz'd, and I'll be reveng'd.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How like my wife!</P>

<P>Dear Madam—</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CLOWNLY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Clownly, I rejoice to see you!—Lady Mary has had some altercation with your servant, but I believe he has not been to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUMPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>How her poor head will ach for this! <STAGE>(Exit. taking off <HI>Fish.)</HI></STAGE></P>

<P><STAGE>(To Lady Mary.)</STAGE> Dear Ma∣dam, have the goodness—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> WALMSLEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done the job.—The thief is taken—and who do you think it is?—The very person in the world!—By Jupiter! I
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
wou'd not have lost the pleasure of taking her up for fifty times the value of the thing.—I caught her just as she was going into Covent Garden theatre, with the goods upon her.—So with the help of one of the playhouse constables, I handed her (in spite of her squalling) into a coach, and have brought her here that she may be properly exposed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY and Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can this mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Speaking loud.)</STAGE> Desire the con∣stable to bring up the woman in custody.—Sir, <STAGE>(To Clownly.)</STAGE> whoever you are, I beg your par∣don—you are not a thief, that I know of—if you are, that's best known to yourself.—I'm a little busy, Sir, at present—you'll excuse me!—Con∣stable, bring up the prisoner!—Why don't you come?—Surely there never was such an accident!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CONSTABLE <HI>with</HI> Lady LOVEALL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There!—You see the goods are upon her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insupportable!—Have not I affirmed, that it was presented to me by Lord Lighthead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am tortured! <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not to be borne?—Sir, you know 'tis mine.—This is only a scheme, on purpose to distress me, in revenge for what I discovered this morning!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, you were vastly pleased at that.—And now 'tis only evening, and I have discovered something that pleases me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well—go on.—But I have sent my servant to Lord Lighthead, to in∣form him of this affair, and I am certain the moment he has found him, his Lordship will come and clear me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There wants no clearing!—Every thing is clear enough!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lord LIGHTHEAD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGHTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Uncle!—Dear Lady Loveall! What's the matter?—Just as I was stepping into my coach, a summons came to me, to attend you upon life and death.—What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No,—no death in the case.—I believe nothing more than hard labour on the Thames.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGHTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, altho' you are my Un∣cle, this insult to a Lady with whom I have the honour to be acquainted, is not to be suf∣fered.—I presented the Lady with that shawl.—It was sent to me by this Lady, <STAGE>(Pointing to Miss Angle)</STAGE> and a few hours after she sent it, her servant received five guineas for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true.—I confess it.—Guilt and shame overpower me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To Miss Angle.)</STAGE> Why the de∣vil
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
did you confess? Nobody would have seen it in your face!—Besides, you have robb'd me of the pleasure of conducting her Ladyship to a prison; and damn me, if I ever met with so great a disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conduct me, Sir—I am ready to attend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has destroyed my peace—and I shall see her go to prison without a sigh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I would not, without losing my life.—Madam, I'll satisfy you for whatever loss you may have sustained by this Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can't satisfy me.—I've lost Mr. Walmsley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now ask her, what she demands for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall take nothing less than the gentleman himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—I like her for that—she does not undervalue me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss ANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Clownly, while you ima∣gine you are giving your protection to a thief only—you are protecting a more despicable cha∣racter.—Had poverty seduced me to the crime of which I am accused, less wou'd have been my remorse, less ought to have been the censure in∣curred—But vanity—folly—a mistaken con∣fidence in that gentleman's honour, and my own attractions, prompted me to avail myself of a contemptible scheme, in order to regain his ac∣quaintance,
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
which (admitting what he profess'd to me real) he himself wou'd have rejoiced at.—But the event has proved and discovered both our hearts—nor can I reproach him with the cru∣elty of his, while I experience the most poig∣nant reproofs of an inward monitor for the guilty folly of my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LOVEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so this was only a scheme for the Lady to procure a husband.—Here, Lady Mary, is your beloved shawl.—Take it, and take care—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, do you take care of that, and I'll take care of myself.—Yet, I don't know, perhaps I may have her; but if I may judge by appearance—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord LIGTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>On that witness, who in com∣pany has not, throughout the adventures of this day, appeared culpable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WALMSLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.—Even I myself at one time made no very innocent figure.—These adventures shall then be a warning to us, never to judge with severity, while the parties have only appearances against them.</P>
