<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem does not pass any judgment upon the Pictures that are now exhibited in the Gallery; but attempts to point out new subjects for future exhibitions: And, in the delineation of new subjects, attention is paid to the principle laid down by our great Painter, (in his notes to the translation of Fres∣noy by Mr. MASON) <Q>That palpable situation is preferable to curious sentiment, as the Pain∣ter speaks to the eye.</Q></P>
<P>The encouragement that is now so liberally extended to Painting, will soon decide the ques∣tion,
<PB REF="7"/>Whether or no our Painters are adequate to the task they are called upon to perform. MACK∣LIN'S exhibition is also a splendid and arduous undertaking: It is another Lyceum, in which riyal Artists may contend for fame and emolu∣ment.</P>

<L>As mus'd the Prophet near mild CHEBAR'S stream <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">EZEKIEL, Chap. 8th.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>And pray'd his God to dart th' enlight'ning gleam,</L>
<L>Abrupt-descending from his airy height,</L>
<L>A form angelic rush'd upon his sight!</L>
<L>With smiling lip he cheer'd the hallow'd Sire,</L>
<L>And bad his soul to Heav'n's best gift aspire:</L>
<L>Then, with strong hand, he grasp'd his silver hair,</L>
<L>And swift convey'd him thro' the yielding air,</L>
<L>Along th' unwinged region of the sky,</L>
<L>The dread, mysterious, deep abyss on high.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="9"/>There Inspiration her bright cloud withdrew,</L>
<L>And pour'd her visions on his daring view:</L>
<L>Then on his rapture-kindled eye arose</L>
<L>Those forms of splendor, those terrific shows,</L>
<L>With which he peopled his celestial dream,</L>
<L>And swell'd his proud magnificence of theme.</L>
<L>To ENGLAND's Leading Bard thus Genius came,</L>
<L>Envelop'd in a robe of holy flame,</L>
<L>And bore him, with a whirlwind's rapid force,</L>
<L>Beyond the solar road, and starry course;</L>
<L>From which far tow'ring and tremendous height</L>
<L>(While now he hovers with suspended flight)</L>
<L>The Poet view'd, as on a spacious plain,</L>
<L>Of human passions the long shadowy train:</L>
<L>As flings the noon-sun his clear beams from high,</L>
<L>On the dim tribes he darts his radiant eye.</L>
<L>'Twas then the favor'd Bard receiv'd the lore,</L>

<L>That revelation to his instinct giv'n,</L>
<L>That ray from GOD, the energy of Heav'n.</L>

<L>To his illumin'd sight was then consign'd</L>
<L>The deep recesses of the Human Mind;</L>

<L>And the dark passage to the Tyrant's heart;</L>
<L>Th' umbrageous winding of the thorny road,</L>
<L>That leads to quick-ey'd Jealousy's abode;</L>
<L>The gath'ring storms that o'er Resentment roll;</L>
<L>The swelling waves that toss the fearful soul;</L>
<L>The calm that breathes around the Infant's rest,</L>
<L>The rugged cavern of the Murd'rer's breast;</L>
<L>The dread materials by the Furies brought,</L>
<L>With which are forg'd Despair's tempestuous thought;</L>

<L>See where the chisel, with victorious strife,</L>
<L>Has urg'd the torpid matter into life!</L>
<L>Lo! the bold Roman to our view consign'd,</L>
<L>His air reflective of his haughty mind;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="28"/>Spite of the foldings of a mean disguise,</L>
<L>His frame majestic strikes th' admiring eyes:</L>
<L>So the tall vessel, shatter'd by the storm,</L>
<L>Retains her native dignity of form:</L>
<L>Behold him, at the hour of conscious pride,</L>
<L>And prompting worth, to confidence allied,</L>
<L>What time he utters, with commanding air,</L>
<L>"My name breathes terror on a Volscian ear!"</L>
<L>This high, heroic task, by Genius plann'd,</L>
<L>Avows th' impression of a female hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Basso-Relievo by the Honourable ANN DAMER.—CORIOLANUS, Act 4th, Scene 5th.</NOTE>:</L>
<L>Illustrious DAMER! tho' thy splendid name</L>
<L>Decks, like a star, the pinnacle of fame,</L>
<L>Yet only they who mark, with aspect near,</L>
<L>The humbler orb of thy domestic sphere,</L>
<L>Can tell (from all the rougher parts refin'd)</L>
<L>How Learning sits enamell'd on thy mind;</L>
<L>How still, thro' various life's eventful scene,</L>
<L>Thy friendship wears th' unfading robe of green!—</L>

<L>NOR shall each task unfold the solemn scene</L>
<L>Hung with the drap'ry of the Tragic Queen:</L>
<L>With airy step THALIA shall advance,</L>
<L>And dart around her grief-expelling glance,</L>
<L>Group the fantastic forms of Humour's court,</L>
<L>And bid the Pleasures o'er the landscape sport.</L>
<L>Where'er our Bard displays his magic pow'rs,</L>
<L>Where'er he treads, arise spontaneous flow'rs,</L>
<L>Which o'er the pallet brighter tints shall throw,</L>
<L>While the live pencil drinks a richer glow.</L>
<L>See where the Birds forsake the realms of air <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Poems.—"The Passionate Pilgrim", at the end.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>And to yon melancholy spot repair;</L>
<L>Where press the bier those images of love,</L>
<L>The radiant Phenix and the faithful Dove:</L>
<L>Just o'er the summit of the funeral pyre,</L>
<L>Wak'd by the gale, ascends the sacred fire.</L>
<L>There Philomela swells her little throat,</L>
<L>To grace the requiem with her saddest note:</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="30"/>There too the pitying Red-breast shall be seen,</L>
<L>And in his bill a leaf of purest green:</L>
<L>The Swallow shall his circling sport forego,</L>
<L>And join this meek society of woe:</L>
<L>The joyous Sky-lark, by compassion won,</L>
<L>Shall check his wonted anthem to the sun,</L>
<L>And, swift-descending from his radiant height,</L>
<L>Devote his music to the hallow'd rite.</L>
<L>E'en birds shall here be seen of ampler form,</L>
<L>Who slowly sail, and dare the gath'ring storm:</L>
<L>The Vulture here shall come, at Sorrow's call,</L>
<L>And the dark Raven spread his hov'ring pall:</L>
<L>The Bird of JOVE shall from his heav'n descend,</L>
<L>And with this train his awful presence blend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye who, with finer sympathies imprest,</L>
<L>Avow th' immaculate and seeling breast,</L>
<L>O white-stol'd Virgins! in long order move,</L>
<L>True to the ritual of the cypress grove;</L>
<L>And, while your souls with chaste affection burn,</L>
<L>With garlands deck the emblematic urn.</L>

<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
<L>Ah! now the zeal that warms my throbbing heart</L>
<L>For all who honor the Poetic art,</L>
<L>Ferments my bosom to this strong desire,</L>
<L>That He who led the Bard's theatric quire,</L>
<L>Whom England mourns—recording still his name,</L>
<L>Who grappled to his own his SHAKSPEARE's fame,</L>
<L>That He, by Sculptor imag'd, here may stand,</L>
<L>In act to speak what his great Idol plann'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus have we travers'd the extensive plain,</L>
<L>Mark'd where the mine contains the swelling vein;</L>
<L>Mark'd where the chosen trees their branches shoot,</L>
<L>And pluck'd the leaves that veil the Golden Fruit!</L>
