<P>SUCH THINGS ARE; A PLAY, IN FIVE ACTS. AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN. BY MRS. INCHBALD.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE travels of an Englishman through∣out Europe, and even in some parts of Asia, to soften the sorrows of the Prisoner, excited in the mind of the Author the subject of the following pages, which, formed into a dramatic story, have produced from the Theatre a profit far exeeeding the usual pecuniary advantages arising from a success∣ful Comedy.</P>
<P>The uncertainty in what part of the East the hero of the present piece was (at the time it was written) dispensing his benevo∣lence, caused the Writer, after many re∣searches and objections, to fix the scene on the island of Sumatra, where the English settlement, the system of government, and every description of the manners of the peo∣ple, reconcile the incidents of the Play to the strictest degree of probability.</P>

<L>HOW say you, critic Gods <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galleries.</NOTE> and you below <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pit.</NOTE></L>
<L>Are you all friends?—or here—and there—a foe?</L>
<L>Come to protect your <HI>literary</HI> trade,</L>
<L>Which Mrs. <HI>Scribble</HI> dares <HI>again</HI> invade—</L>
<L>But know you not—<HI>in all</HI> the fair ones do,</L>
<L>'Tis not to please themselves alone—but you.</L>
<L>Then who so churlish, or so cynic grown,</L>
<L>Would wish to change a <HI>simper</HI> for a <HI>frown?</HI></L>
<L>Or who so jealous of their own <HI>dear</HI> quill,</L>
<L>Would point the paragraph her fame to kill?</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et such there are, in this all-scribbling town,</L>
<L>And men of letters too—of some renown,</L>
<L>Who sicken at all merit but their own.</L>
<L>But sure 'twere more for Wit's—for Honour's sake,</L>
<L>To make the Drama's <HI>race—the give and take.</HI></L>

<L>My hint I see's approv'd—so pray begin it,</L>
<L>And praise us—<HI>roundly</HI> for the <HI>good things</HI> in it,</L>
<L>Nor let severity our faults expose,</L>
<L>When godlike Homer's self was known to doze.</L>
<L>But of the piece—Methinks I hear you hint,</L>
<L>Some dozen lines or more should give the tint—</L>
<L>"Tell how <HI>Sir John</HI> with <HI>Lady Betty's</HI> maid</L>
<L>"Is caught intriguing at a masquerade;</L>
<L>"Which Lady Betty, in a jealous fit,</L>
<L>"Resents by flirting with <HI>Sir Ben</HI>—the cit.</L>
<L>"Whose <HI>three</HI>-feet spouse, to modish follies bent,</L>
<L>"Mistakes a <HI>six</HI>-feet Valet—for a Gent.</L>

<PB REF="4"/>
<L>"Whilst Miss, repugnant to her Guardian's plan,</L>
<L>"Elopes in Breeches with her fav'rite man."</L>
<L>Such are the <HI>hints</HI> we read in <HI>Roscius'</HI> days,</L>
<L>By way of Prologue ushered in <HI>their</HI> plays.</L>
<L>But <HI>we,</HI> like Ministers and cautious spies,</L>
<L>In <HI>secret measures</HI> think—the merit lies.</L>
<L>Yet shall the Muse thus far unveil the plot—</L>
<L>This play was <HI>tragi-comically</HI> got,</L>
<L>Those sympathetic sorrows to impart</L>
<L>Which harmonize the feelings of the heart;</L>
<L>And may at least this humble merit boast,</L>
<L>A structure founded on fair <HI>Fancy's</HI> coast.</L>
<L>With you it rests that judgement to proclaim,</L>
<L>Which <HI>in the world</HI> must raise or sink it's fame.</L>
<L>Yet ere her judges sign their last report,</L>
<L>'Tis you [<HI>to the boxes</HI>] must recommend her to the Court;</L>
<L>Whose smiles, like <HI>Cynthia,</HI> in a winter's night,</L>
<L>Will cheer our wand'rer with a gleam of light.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> Luke, <HI>followed by Lady</HI> Tremor.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>I TELL you, Madam, you are two and thirty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Tremor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Sir, you are mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, did not you come over from England exactly sixteen years ago?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not we been married the tenth of next April sixteen years?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so long.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you not come over the year of the great Eclipse? answer me that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't remember it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I do—and shall remember it as long as I live—the first time I saw you, was in the garden of the Dutch Envoy; you were looking through a glass at the sun—I immediately began to make love to you, and the whole affair was
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>settled while the eclipse lasted—just one hour eleven minutes, and three seconds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is all this to my age?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I know you were at that time near seventeen—and without one qualification except your youth—and not being a Mullatto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Luke, Sir Luke, this is not to be borne—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes—I forgot—you had two letters of recommendation, from two great fa∣milies in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Letters of recommendation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; your character—that, you know, is all the fortune we poor Englishmen, situ∣ated in India, expect with a wife who crosses the sea at the hazard of her life, to make us happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what but our characters would you have us bring? Do you suppose any lady ever came to India, who brought along with her, friends, or fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear—and what is worse—she seldom leaves them behind, either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, Sir Luke—but if I delivered to you a good character—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear you did—and if you were to ask me for it again, I can't say I could give it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>How uncivil! how unlike are your manners to the manners of my Lord Flint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—you are never so happy as when you have an opportunity of expressing your ad∣miration of him—a disagreeable, nay, a very dangerous man—one is never sure of one's self in his presence—he carries every thing he hears to the ministers of our suspicious Sultan—and I feel my head shake whenever I am in his company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>How different does his Lordship appear to me—to me he is all <HI>politesse.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Politesse!</HI> how shou'd you under∣derstand what is real <HI>politesse?</HI> You know your education was very much confined.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if it <HI>was</HI> confined——I beg, Sir Luke, you will one time or other cease these re∣flections—you know they are what I can't bear! <STAGE>[walks about in a passion.]</STAGE> pray, does not his Lord∣ship continually assure me, I might be taken for a Countess, were it not for a certain little groveling toss I have caught with my head—and a certain little confined hitch in my walk? both which I learnt of <HI>you</HI>—learnt by looking so much at <HI>you.</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now if you don't take care, by looking so much at his Lordship, you may catch some of his defects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know of very few he has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know of many—besides those he assumes.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Assumes!!——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; do you suppose he is as forget∣ful as he pretends to be? no, no—but because he is a favourite with the Sultan, and all our great men at court, he thinks it genteel or convenient to have no memory—and yet I'll answer for it, he has one of the best in the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe your charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, though he forgets his ap∣pointments with his tradesmen, did you ever hear of his forgetting to go to court when a place was to be disposed of? Did he ever make a blunder, and send a bribe to a man out of power? Did he ever forget to kneel before the Prince of this Island—or to look in his highness's presence like the sta∣tue of Patient-resignation in humble expectation?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, Sir Luke——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sent from his own country in his very infancy, and brought up in the different
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>courts of petty, arbitrary Princes here in Asia; he is the slave of every great man, and the tyrant of every poor one.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Petty Princes!"—'tis well his high∣ness our Sultan does not hear you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis well he does not—don't you repeat what I say—but you know how all this fine country is harrassed and laid waste by a set of Princes, Sultans, as they style themselves, and I know not what—who are for ever calling out to each other "that's mine," and "that's mine;"—and "you have no business here"—and "you have no business there"—and "<HI>I</HI> have business every where;" <STAGE>[Strutting]</STAGE> then "give <HI>me</HI> this,"—and "give <HI>me</HI> that;" and "take this, and take that."</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[makes signs of fighting.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very elegant description truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you know 'tis all matter of fact—and Lord Flint, brought up from his youth amongst these people, has not one <HI>trait</HI> of an Eng∣lishman about him—he has imbibed all this coun∣try's cruelty, and I dare say wou'd mind no more seeing me hung up by my thumbs—or made to dance upon a red-hot gridiron——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is one of the tortures I never heard of!—O! I shou'd like to see that of all things!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—by keeping this man's com∣pany, you'll soon be as cruel as he is—he will teach you every vice—a consequential—grave—dull—and yet with that degree of levity, that dares to pay his addresses to a woman, even before her husband's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you say, this minute, his Lord∣ship had not a <HI>trait</HI> of his own country about him?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well—as you say, that last <HI>is</HI> a <HI>trait</HI> of his own country.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="13"/>these five years past, and the dress of us English gentlemen is so much altered fince that time—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady. [to Twineall.]</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, his Lordship has made a mistake in the word "ridiculous," which I am sure he did not mean to say—but he is apt to make use of one word for another—his Lordship has been so long out of England, that he may be said in some measure to have forgotten his native language.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[His Lordship all this time appears consequen∣tially absent.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have perfectly explained, Ma∣dam—indeed I ought to have been convinced,
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>without your explanation, that if his Lordship made use of the word <HI>ridiculous</HI> (even intention∣ally) that the word had now changed its former sense, and was become a mode to express satisfac∣tion—or his Lordship wou'd not have made use of it in the very forcible manner he did, to a per∣fect stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Mr. Twineall, have you new modes, new fashions for <HI>words</HI> too in England, as well as for dresses?—and are you equally ex∣travagant in their adoption?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard, Sir Luke, but that the fashion of words varied, as well as the fashion of every thing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is most extraordinary—we have now a fashion in England, of speaking without any words at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, how is that?</P>
</SP>

<P>Ay, do, Mr. Twineall, teach my wife, and I shall be very much obliged to you—it will be a great accomplishment. Even you, my Lord, ought to be attentive to this fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, for instance, when a gen∣tleman is asked a question which is either trouble∣some or improper to answer, you don't say you <HI>won't</HI> answer it, even though you speak to an infe∣rior——but you say——"really it appears to me e-e-e-e-e— <STAGE>[mutters and shrugs]</STAGE>—that is—mo-mo-mo-mo-mo— <STAGE>[mutters]</STAGE>—if you see the thing—for my part——te-te-te-te——and that's all I can tell about it at <HI>persent.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have told nothing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mayn't one guess what you mean?</P>

<P>O, yes—perfectly at liberty to guess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll be shot if I <HI>could</HI> guess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>And again—when an impertinent pedant
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>asks you a question that you know nothing about, and it may not be convenient to say so—you answer <HI>boldly,</HI> "why really, Sir, my opinion <HI>is,</HI> that the Greek poet—he-he-he-he— <STAGE>[mutters]</STAGE>—we-we-we-we—you see—if his idea was—and if the Latin translator—mis-mis-mis-mis— <STAGE>[shrugs]</STAGE>——that I shou'd think—in my humble opinion—but the Doctor <HI>may</HI> know better than I."——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Doctor must know very little else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or in case of a duel, where one does not care to say who was right, or who was wrong—you answer—"<HI>This,</HI> Sir, is the state of the mat∣ter—Mr. F—came first—te-te-te-te—on that—be-be-be-be—if the other—in short— <STAGE>[whispers]</STAGE>—whis-whis-whis-whis"—</P>

<P>What?</P>

<P>There, now you have it—there 'tis—but don't say a word about it—or, if you do—don't say it come from me."—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you have not told a word of the story!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that your auditor must not say to you—that's not the fashion—he never tells you that——he may say—"You have not made yourself <HI>perfectly</HI> clear;"—or he may say—" He must have the matter <HI>more particularly</HI> pointed out somewhere else;"—but that is all the auditor can say with good breeding.</P>

<P>Why, one does not like to speak much about the country one lives in—but, Mr. Haswell, you have been visiting our encampments; <HI>you</HI> may tell us what is going on there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Haswell, is it true that the Sultan cut off the head of one of his wives the other day because she said "I won't?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, my dear, be silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, that the Sultan had you instead of me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with my head off, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear; in that state, I shou'd have no objection to you myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady. [Aside to Sir Luke.]</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, I'll frighten you ten times more.—But, Mr. Haswell, I am told there are many persons suspected of disaffec∣tion to the present Sultan, who have been lately, by his orders, arrested, and sold to slavery, not∣withstanding there was no proof against them pro∣duced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proof!——in a State such as this, the charge is quite sufficient.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Luke. [In apparent agonies, wishing to turn

<P>Well, my Lord, and how does your Lordship find yourself this afternoon?—this morning, I mean—Bless my soul! why I begin to be as forgetful as your Lordship.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look at him, and tremble for <HI>yours</HI>—and so, Mr. Haswell, all this is true?—and some people, of consequence too, I am told, dragged from their homes, and sent to slavery merely on suspicion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, less do I pity those, than some, whom prisons and dungeons crammed before, are yet prepared to receive.</P>

<P>Mr. Haswell, such is the Sultan's plea∣sure.</P>

<P>Will your Lordship take a turn in the garden? it looks from this door very pleasant;—does not it?</P>

<P>But pray, Mr. Haswell, has not the Sul∣tan sent for you to attend at his palace this morn∣ing?</P>

<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>There! I heard he had, but Sir Luke said not.—I am told he thinks himself under the greatest obligations to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>The report has flattered me—but if his highness <HI>shou'd</HI> think himself under obligations, I can readily point a way, by which he may acquit himself of them.</P>

<P>MY dear friend, after so long a separa∣tion, how gland I am to meet you!—but how de∣vilish unlucky that you shou'd, on the very day of my arrival, be going to set sail for another part of the world! yet before you go, I must beg a fa∣vour of you—you know Sir Luke and his family perfectly well, I dare say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so—I have been in his house near six years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very person on earth I wanted!—Sir Luke has power here, I suppose?—a word from him might do a man some service perhaps?</P>
<STAGE>[significantly.</STAGE>

<P>Why, yes; I don't know a man that has more influence at a certain place.</P>
</SP>

<P>And her Ladyship seems a very clever gentlewoman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Very.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have a notion they think <HI>me</HI> very clever.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear friend, you must help me to make them think better of me still—and when
<PB N="16" REF="21"/><HI>my</HI> fortune is made, I'll make <HI>yours</HI>—for when I once become acquainted with people's dispositions, their little weaknesses, foibles and faults, I can wind, twist, twine, and get into the corner of every one's heart, and lie so snug, they can't know I'm there, till they want to pull me out, and find 'tis impossible.</P>

<P>Is not it? and now, my dear friend, do you inform me of the secret dispositions, and propensities of every one in this family, and of all their connections.—What Lady values herself upon one qualification, and what Lady upon ano∣ther?—What Gentleman will like to be told of his accomplishments? or his daughter's?—or of his horses? or of his dogs?—now, my dear Ned, ac∣quaint me with all this—and within a fortnight I will become the most necessary rascal——not a creature shall know how to exist without me.</P>

<P>Why such a man as you ought to have made your fortune in England.</P>

<P>Thank you, my dear friend—thank you. <STAGE>[Writes]</STAGE> Was he ever in the army?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes—besieged a capital fortress, a few years ago—and now, the very name of a bat∣tle or a great general tickles his vanity, and he takes all the praises you can lavish upon the sub∣ject as compliments to himself.</P>

<P>And though she is so nicely scrupulous as never to mention the word genealogy, yet I have seen her agitation so great, when the advan∣tages of high birth have been extoll'd, she could scarcely withhold her sentiments of triumph; which in order to disguise, she has assumed a dis∣dain for all "vain titles—empty sounds—and idle pomp."</P>

<P>She has, I know, in her possession—but I dare say she wou'd not show it you, nay, on the contrary, would even <HI>affect</HI> to be highly of∣fended, if you were to mention it—and yet it certainly would flatter her, to know you were ac∣quainted with her having it.</P>

<P>Sure:—he blinds Sir Luke, (who by the bye is no great politician) but I know his Lord∣ship—and if he thought he was sure of his ground—(and he thinks he <HI>shall</HI> be sure of it soon)—then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll insinuate myself and join his party—but, in the mean time, preserve good terms with Sir Luke, in case any thing shou'd fall in my way there.—Who is Mr. Haswell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>He pretends to be a man of principle and sentiment—flatter him on that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The easieft thing in the world—no peo∣ple like flattery better than such as he.—They will bear even to hear their <HI>vices</HI> praised.—I will myself undertake to praise the vices of a man of sentiment till he shall think them so many virtues.—You have mentioned no Ladies, but the Lady of the house yet.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no other Lady, except a pretty girl who came over from England, about two years ago, for a husband, and not succeeding in another

<P>Let me alone, to please her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—I believe you are skilled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the art of flattery, no one more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>But damn it—it is not a liberal art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a great science, notwithstanding—and studied, at present, by all the connoisseurs.—Zounds! I have staid a long time—I can't attend to any more characters at present—Sir Luke and his Lady will think me inattentive, if I don't join them—Shall I see you again?—if not—I wish you a pleasant voyage—I'll make the most of what you have told me—you'll hear I'm a great man—God bless you!—good bye!—you'll hear I'm a great man.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, if I am not mistaken, I shall hear you are turned out of the house before to-morrow morning. O, Twineall! exactly the <HI>reverse</HI> of every character have you now before you—the greatest misfortune in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife of Sir Luke has been, flying from his army in the midst of an en∣gagement, and a most humiliating degradation in consequence, which makes him so feelingly alive on the subject of a battle, that nothing but his want of courage can secure my friend Twineall's life for venturing to name the subject—then Lord Flint, firmly <HI>attached</HI> to the <HI>interest</HI> of the Sultan, will be all on fire, when he hears of open disaf∣fection—but most of all her Ladyship! whose fa∣ther was a grocer, and uncle, a noted advertising "Periwig-maker on a new construction." She will run mad to hear of births, titles, and long pedigrees.—Poor Twineall! little dost thou think what is prepared for thee.—There is Mr. Haswell too—but to him have I sent you to be reclaimed—to him,—who, free from faults, or even foibles,
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>of his own, has yet more potently the blessing given, of tenderness for ours.</P>

<P>WHY, then Aurelia, (though I never men∣tion'd it to my Lady Tremor) my friend wrote me word, he had reason to suppose your affections were improperly fixed upon a young gentleman in that neighbourhood; and this was his reason for wishing you to leave that place to come hither—and this continual dejection convinces me my friend was not mistaken—answer me—can you say he was?</P>

<P>No, indeed, I did not—but I thought Sir Luke had frequently charged me with the want of patience; and that moment, the very thing in the world I cou'd have wished, happened—on purpose to give me an opportunity to prove his accusation false.</P>

<P>That day, in particular, we did not—for I remember you had been no less than three hours at your toilet.</P>

<P>Sir Luke, is there a doubt of the Em∣peror's birth and title? he is the real Sultan, de∣pend upon it—it surprises me to hear you talk with the smallest uncertainty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir Luke, I wonder at it too, <STAGE>[<HI>Aside to Lord</HI> Flint.]</STAGE> and yet, damn me, my Lord, if I have not my doubts.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I,</HI> my Lord? far be it from me! I was only saying what other people said; for my part <HI>I</HI> never harboured a doubt of the kind.— <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> My head begins to nod, only for that word—pray Heaven, I may die with it on!—I shou'd not like to lose my head—nor shou'd I like to die by a bullet—nor by a small sword—and a cannon ball wou'd be as disagreeable, as any thing, I know—it is very odd—but I never yet could make up my mind, in what manner I shou'd. like to go out of the world.</P>

<P>Your temerity astonishes me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own, my Lord, I feel somewhat aukward in saying it to your Lordship—but my own heart—my own conscience—my own senti∣ments—they <HI>are</HI> my own—and they are dear to
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>me.—And so it is—the Sultan does not appear to be <STAGE>[With significance.]</STAGE> that great man some peo∣ple think him.</P>

<P>Sir, you astonish me—pray what is your name? I have forgotten it.</P>

<P>Twineall, my Lord—the honourable Henry Twineall—your Lordship does me great honour to ask—arrived this morning from England, as your Lordship may remember—in the ship Mercury, my Lord—and all the officers on board speaking with the highest admiration and warm∣est terms of your Lordship's official character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, Mr. Twineall, I am very sorry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so am I, my Lord, that your senti∣ments and mine shou'd so far disagree, as I <HI>know</HI> they do.—I am not unacquainted with your firm adherence to the Emperor—but I am unused to disguise my thoughts—I cou'd not, if I wou'd—I have no little views—no sinister motives—no plots—no intrigues—no schemes of preferment,—and I verily believe that if a large scymitar was now directed at my head—or a large pension di∣rected to my pocket—(in the first case at least) I shou'd speak my mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord. [Aside.]</SPEAKER>
<P>A dangerous young man this! and I may make something of the discovery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi. [Aside.]</SPEAKER>
<P>It tickles him to the soul, I find.—My Lord, now I begin to be warm on the sub∣ject, I feel myself quite agitated—and, from the intelligence which I have heard, even when I was in England,—there is every reason to suppose——exm—exm—exm——</P>

<P>I <HI>do</HI> pardon your thoughts, with all my heart—but your words, young man, must be answer'd for <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Lady Tremor, good morning.</P>

<P>Shall we have your Lordship's company towards the evening? Mr. Haswell will be here; if your Lordship has no objection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know Mr. Haswell will be here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he has just called, in his way to the Palace, and said so—and he has been telling us some very interesting stories too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of his moring visits, I suppose—I heard Meanright say he saw him very busy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Luke and I dine out, my Lord; but we shall return early in the evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be here, without fail.—Sir Luke, aword with you if you please— <STAGE>[They come forward.]</STAGE> Mr. Twineall has taken some very improper li∣berties with the Sultan's name, and I must insist on making him answer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you are extremely welcome <STAGE>[Trembling.]</STAGE> to do whatever your Lordship pleases with any one belonging to me, or to my house—but I hope your Lordship will pay some regard to the master of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! great regard to the master—and to the mistress also.—But for that gentleman—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do <HI>what</HI> your Lordship pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will—and I will make him—</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Lordship does not forget it.</P>

<P>I don't, in the least, doubt it, my Lord—I never did doubt it.</P>

<P>I don't, in the least, doubt it, my Lord—I never did doubt it.</P>

<P>You may depend upon seeing me here in the evening—and then you shall find I have not threatened more than I mean to perform—good morning!</P>

<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has to do with <HI>every thing,</HI> Madam—even with beauty—and I wish I may suffer death, if a woman, with all the mental and personal ac∣complishments of the finest creature in Europe, wou'd to me be of that value, <STAGE>[Snapping his finger.]</STAGE> if lowly born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I sincerely wish every man who visits me was of the same opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, Mr. Twineall! persons of mean birth ought not to be despised for what it was not in their power to prevent—and if it is a misfor∣tune, you shou'd consider them only as objects of pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>My dear—Lady Tremor— <STAGE>[Taking her aside.]</STAGE> let him alone—let him go on—there is something preparing for him he little expects—so let the poor man say and do what he pleases, for the present—it won't last long—for he has offended
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>my Lord Flint, and, I dare say his Lordship will be able, upon some account or another, to get him imprisoned for life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Imprisoned! Why not take off his head at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, my dear—I am sure I have no objection—and I dare say my Lord will have it done, to oblige you.—Egad, I must make friends with her to keep mine safe.</P>

<P>You are grown extremely polite.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, my dear, his Lordship has taught me how to be polite.—Mr. Twineall, Lady Tre∣mor and I are going to prepare for our visit, and I will send a servant to shew you to your apart∣ment, in order to dress, for you will favour us with your company, I hope?</P>

<P>If I have not settled my business in this family, I am mistaken—they seem to have but one mind about me.—Devilish clever fellow, egad!—I am the man to send into the world—such a vo∣latile, good-looking scoundrel too! No one sus∣pects me——to be sure I am under some few obli∣gations to my friend for letting me into the dif∣ferent characters of the family—and yet I don't know whether I am obliged to him or not—for if he had not made me acquainted with them—I shou'd soon have had the skill to find them out myshelf.—No; I will not think myshelf under any

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haswell.</SPEAKER>
<P>RATHER remain in this loathsome prison!—refuse the blessing offered you!—the blessing your pleased fancy formed so precious you durst not even trust its reality!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pris.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—while my pleased <HI>fancy</HI> only saw the prospect, I own it was delightful; but now rea∣son beholds it within my reach, the view is changed—and what, in the gay dream of fond de∣lirium, seemed a blessing, in my waking hours of sad reflection would prove the most severe of pu∣nishments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain—what is the cause that makes you think thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pris.</SPEAKER>
<P>A cause that has alone for fourteen years made me resigned to a fate like this.—When you first mentioned my release from this drear place, my wild ideas included, with the light, all that had ever made the light a blessing—'twas not the <HI>sun</HI> I saw in my mad transport, but a lost husband filled my roving fancy—'twas his idea that gave the colours of the world their beauty, and made me fondly hope to grasp its sweets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>A husband!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pris.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the world that I was wont to enjoy
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>with him—to see again without him—every well∣known object would wound my mind with dear re∣membrances for ever lost, and make my freedom torture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>But yet—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! on my knees a thousand times I have thanked Heaven that <HI>he</HI> partook not of this dire abode—that he shared not with me my hard usage!—a greater blessing I possess'd from that, than all his loved society cou'd have given—but in a happy world, where smiling nature pours her boundless gifts!—oh! there his loss wou'd be un∣sufferable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you lament him dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pris.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—or, like me, a prisoner—else he wou'd have sought me out—have sought his Ara∣bella!— <STAGE>[Haswell <HI>starts.</HI>]</STAGE>—Why do you start?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you a Christian?—an European?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>The name made me suppose it.—I am shocked that—the Christian's sufferings— <STAGE>[Try∣ing to conceal his surprise.]</STAGE>—but were you made a prisoner in the <HI>present</HI> Sultan's reign?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, or I had been set free on his ascent to the throne; for he gave pardon to all the ene∣mies of the slain monarch: but I was taken in a vessel, where I was hurried in the heat of the battle with a party of the late Emperor's friends—and all the prisoners were by the officers of the present Sultan sent to slavery, or confined, as I have been, in hopes of ransom from their friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did never intelligence or inquiry reach you from your husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I once was informed of a large reward for the discovery of a female Christian, and, with
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>boundless hopes, asked an interview with the mes∣senger; but found, on inquiry, <HI>I</HI> could not an∣swer his description, as he <HI>secretly</HI> informed me it was the Sultan who made the search for one <HI>he himself</HI> had known and dearly loved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Heaven!— <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>—You then con∣clude your husband dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do;—or, like me, by some mischance, taken with the other party, and having no friend to plead his cause before the Emperor, whom he served—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI>'ll plead it—should I ever chance to find him—but, ere we can hope for other kindness, you must appear before the Sultan—thank him for the favour which you now decline, and tell the cause why you cannot accept it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! almost worn out with sorrow—an object of affliction as I am—in pity, excuse me—present my thanks—my humble gratitude—but pardon my attendance.</P>

<P>Nay, you must go—it is necessary—I will accompany you to him.—Retire a moment; but when I send, be ready.</P>

<P>Believe me, Emperor, I forgive all who have ever wronged me—all who have ever caused my sufferings.—Pardon <HI>you!</HI>—Alas!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Arabella! through the amazing changes of my fate, (which I will soon disclose) think not but I have searched for <HI>thee</HI> with uncea∣sing care; but the blessing to behold you once again was left for my kind monitor alone to be∣stow.——Oh, Haswell! had I, like you, made others' miseries my concern, like you sought out the wretched, how many days of sorrow had I spared myself as well as others—for I long since had found my Arabella.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Heaven! that weighest our sufferings with our joys, and as our lives decline seest in the balance thy blessings far more ponderous than thy judgements—be witness, I complain no more of what I have endured, but find an ample recom∣pence this moment.</P>

<P>I told you, Sir, how you might be happy.</P>

<P>Come, my beloved wife!—come to my palace—there, equally, my dearest blessing, as when the cottage gave its fewer joys—and in him <STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> Haswell.]</STAGE> we not only find our present happi∣ness, but dwell securely on our future hopes—for here, I vow, before he leaves our shores, I will adopt every measure he shall point out—and that period of my life whereon he shall lay his censure,

<P>I hope you take it as such—I am sure I mean it as such.—It kills me to leave <HI>you</HI>—it breaks my heart;—and I once flattered myself such a charitable, good, feeling, humane heart as you possess—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! Hold!—This, Mr. Twineall, is the vice which has driven you to the fatal precipice whereon you are—and in death will you not relin∣quish it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>What vice, Sir, do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flattery!—a vice that renders you not only despicable, but odious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how has flattery been the cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your English friend, before he left the island, told me what information you had asked from him, and that he had given you the direct <HI>opposite</HI> of every person's character, as a just pu∣nishment for your mean premeditation and de∣signs.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never imagined that amiable friend had sense enough to impose upon any body!</P>

<P>No, Madam, it is on—and I am very happy to be able to tell you so.—</P>

<P>Dear Heaven!—I expected to have seen it off!—but no matter—as it is on—I am come that it may be kept on—and have brought my Lord Flint, and Sir Luke, as witnesses.</P>

<P>Tell it to me, Sir—I will report it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Mr. Haswell, as Ghosts sometimes walk—and as one's conscience is some∣times troublesome—I think Mr. Twineall has done nothing to merit death, and the charge which his Lordship sent in against him, we begin to think too severe—but, if there was any false statement—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the fault of my not charging my
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>memory—any error I have been guilty of, must be laid to the fault of my total want of memory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you hope from this confes∣fion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>To remit the prisoner's punishment of death to something less, if the Sultan will please to annul the sentence</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—and grant ten or twelve years im∣prisonment—or the Gallies for fourteen years—or—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, something in that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Has.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame—for shame—Gentlement!—the extreme rigour you shew in punishing a dis∣sension from your opinion, or a satire upon your folly, proves to conviction, what reward you had bestowed upon the <HI>skilful</HI> flatterer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Twi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen and Ladies, pray why wou'd you wish me requited with such extreme severity, merely for my humble endeavours to make my∣self agreeable?—Lady Tremor, upon my ho∣nour I was credibly informed, your ancestors were Kings of Scotland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!—you might as well say that you heard Sir Luke had distinguished himself at the battle of—</P>

<P>And, I <HI>did</HI> hear so</P>

<P>And he <HI>did</HI> distinguish himself; for he was the only one that ran away.</P>
</SP>

<P>Cou'd it happen?</P>

<P>Yes, Sir, it did happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>And go <HI>you,</HI> Mr. Twineall, into a field of battle, and I think it is very likely to hap∣pen again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Mr. Haswell has obtained your par∣don, Sir, it is all very well—but let me advise you to keep your sentiments on politics to your∣self,
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>for the future—as you value that pretty head of yours.</P>

<P>I thank you, Sir—I do value it.</P>

<P>Aurelia, in this letter to me, has explained your story with so much com∣passion, that, for her sake, I must pity it too.—With freedom to your father, and youself, the Sultan restores his forfeited lands—and might I plead, Sir Luke, for your interest with Aureila's friends, this young man's filial love, shou'd be repaid by conjugal affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luke.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for that, Mr. Haswell, you have so much interest at court, that your taking the young man under you protection—besides, as Aurelia was sent hither merely to get a husband—I don't see—</P>

<P>Pray Mr. Haswell, will you suffer all these encomiums?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He <HI>must</HI> suffer them—there are virtues, which praise cannot taint—such are Mr. Haswell's—for they are the offspring of a mind, superior even to the love of fame—neither can they, through malice, suffer by applause, since they are too sacred to incite envy, and must conciliate the respect, the love, and the admiration of all.</P>

<BYLINE>Written by MILES-PETER ANDREWS, Esq.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>SINCE all are sprung, they say, from Mother Earth,</L>
<L>Why stamp a merit or disgrace on birth?</L>
<L>Yet so it is, however we disguise it,</L>
<L>All boast their origin, or else despise it.</L>
<L>This pride or shame haunts ev'ry living soul</L>
<L>From Hyde-park Corner, down to Limehouse Hole:</L>
<L>Peers, taylors, poets, statesmen, undertakers,</L>
<L>Knights, squires, man-milliners, and peruke-makers.</L>
<L><HI>Sir Hugh Glengluthglin,</HI> from the land of goats,</L>
<L>Tho' out at elbows, shews you all his coats;</L>
<L>And rightful heir to <HI>twenty pounds</HI> per annum,</L>
<L>Boasts the rich blood that warm'd his great great gran∣nam;</L>
<L>While wealthy Simon Soapsuds; just be-knighted,</L>
<L>Struck with the sword of state, is grown dim sighted,</L>
<L>Forgets the neighbouring chins he used to lather,</L>
<L>And scarecely knows he ever had a father.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Author, then, correct in every line,</L>
<L>From nature's characters hath pictur'd mine;</L>
<L>For many a lofty fair, who, friz'd and curl'd,</L>
<L>With crest of horse hair, tow'ring thro' the world,</L>
<L>To powder, paste, and pins, ungrateful grown,</L>
<L>Thinks the full periwig is all her own;</L>
<L>Proud of her conquering ringlets, onward goes,</L>
<L>Nor thanks the barber, from whose hands she rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus doth false pride fantastic minds mislead,</L>
<L>And make our weaker sex seem weak indeed:</L>
<L>Suppose, to prove this truth, in mirthful strain,</L>
<L>We bring the <HI>Dripping family</HI> again.—</L>
<L>Papa, a tallow chandler by descent,</L>
<L>Had read "how <HI>larning</HI> is most excellent:"</L>
<L>So Miss, returned from boarding school at Bow,</L>
<L>Waits to be finished by Mama and Co.—</L>
<L><PB REF="83"/>
"<HI>See, spouse, how spruce our Nan is grown, and tall</HI>;</L>
<L>"<HI>I'll lay, she cuts a dash at Lord Mayor's ball.</HI>"—</L>
<L>In bolts the maid—" <HI>Ma'am! Miss's master's come;</HI>"—</L>
<L>Away fly Ma' and Miss to dancing room—</L>
<L>"<HI>Walk in Mounseer; come,</HI> Nan, <HI>draw up like me.</HI>"—</L>
<L>"<HI>Ma fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! Madame, Miss like you as two pea.</HI>"—</L>
<L>Mounseer takes out his kit; the scene begins;</L>
<L>Miss trusses up; my lady Mother grins;—</L>
<L>"<HI>Ma'amselle, me teach a you de step to tread;</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>First turn you toe, den turn you littel bead;</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>One, two, dree, sinka, risa, balance; bon,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Now entrechat, and new de cotillon.</HI></L>
<STAGE>[Singing and dancing about,</STAGE>
<L>"<HI>Pardieu, Ma'amselle be one enchanting girl</HI>;</L>
<L>"<HI>Me no surprise to see her ved an Earl.</HI>"—</L>
<L>"<HI>With all my heart, says Miss; Mounseer, I'm ready</HI>;</L>
<L>"<HI>I dream'd last night, Ma, I should be a Lady.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus do the <HI>Drippings,</HI> all important grown,</L>
<L>Expect to shine with lustre not their own;</L>
<L>New airs are got, fresh graces, and fresh washes,</L>
<L>New caps, new gauze, new feathers, and new sashes;</L>
<L>Till just complete for conquest at Guildhall.</L>
<L>Down comes an order to suspend the ball.</L>
<L>Miss Shrieks, Ma' scolds, Pa' seems to have lost his tether;</L>
<L>Caps, custards, coronets—all sink together—</L>
<L>Papa resumes his jacket, dips away,</L>
<L>And Miss lives single, till next Lord Mayor's day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If such the <HI>sorrow,</HI> and if such the strife,</L>
<L>That break the comforts of domestic life,</L>
<L>Look to the hero, who this night appears,</L>
<L>Whose boundless excellence the World reveres;</L>
<L>Who, friend to nature, by no blood confin'd,</L>
<L>Is the glad relative of all mankind.</L>
