<P>As certain Dramatic Writers postpone the Publica∣tion of their Pieces, intimidated by every mean mercenary Momus of the day, called a Critic, the Printer, for the present, thus presumes to present the Public with corrected Copies of such Plays, as, having passed the Theatrical Odeal, have so long been confined to the bare Representation.</P>
<P>Nor does he, by this accommodation, mean to injure the Authors, but rather would prepare the way for their approach to the Temple of Fame. For their en∣couragement, He assures such Candidates, that the howling sons of Cerberus are easily soothed by a <HI>sop,</HI> and that the music of <HI>money</HI> will readily lull the most watchful descendant of <HI>Argus.</HI></P>
<P>Several of the Printer's Co-temporaries having forced into the world depraved and mutilated Copies of the Unpublished Plays, he has fallen upon an ex∣pedient of procuring them as Correct as they stand on the Prompter's Book, and represented at the Royal Theatres. With regard to the following <HI>Opera,</HI> he only observes, that others with him have "run in the race to entertain the Public, but he alone has obtained the PRIZE."</P>

<P>Why, who?</P>
</SP>

<P>Who but I—Monsieur Frican∣deau, the French cook, was my old acquain∣tance;
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>so, under pretence of recommending him some very nice sauce for the Mayor that I bought him, I whipt in a little saccha∣rum saturni, and gave the whole family the co∣lic. If you recollect, by making a very slight encrease of their disorder at the beginning you kept 'em under your care for nine weeks.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, yes; that was a snug job, I must own.</P>

<P>That's true, Label—I must go once more as an apothecary—poh! But never more will I look on a gallipot—you shall never more know me to have

<P>Why surely nothing can be handsomer than Mr. Heartwell's behaviour in writing thus to you,</P>

<P>Now my dear papa! I have hit on a scheme which you must assist me to put in practice; after which, if you desire it, I am willing to marry Mr. Lenitive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAD.</SPEAKER>
<P>A scheme! nonsense! what scheme is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Only to inform Mr. Heartwell and Mr. Lenitive, that you have disinherited me, and settled your fortune on my cousin Clara; then suffer me to pass for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we may make trial of 'em both, and find which is the most disinterested; and see who's in the right, you or I,</P>

<SP>

<P>What, and if Heartwell makes love to the suppos'd cousin—</P>

<P>Very well</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAD.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you don't consider, that Clara has been so long in France, she has more than half forgot the use of her native tongue; how then will you pass for her without being dis∣covered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more easy; 'tis only dres∣sing myself out like an Opera dancer, tossing

<SPEAKER>CAD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark'e, Caroline, you may imitate your cousin's affectation, and toss your head about as much as you please; but as long as I have a leg to stand on, I promise ye none of my family shall ever imitate the French.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, don't misconceive me; I mean to disguise myself, only by an exposition of their folly; for, however I may copy their ridicule by this scheme I have in my head, my heart is of true English growth, I assure ye.</P>

<P>Lenitive, Sir—Luke Lenitive, Esq. at your service: but apothecary no more.</P>

<P>Sir, I've left my business! but pray, Captain, have you any right to prescribe to me? I've got Ten thousand pound in my pocket, that's more than every gentleman of the army can boast,</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark'e, Mr. Whippersnapper, if

<P>Egad, then I'll chuse a sufficient long one.</P>
</SP>
