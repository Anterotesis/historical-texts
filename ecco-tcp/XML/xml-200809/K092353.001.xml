<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I AM well aware that some of the ear∣liest Letters to be met in this Collec∣tion will, at first Glance, appear too trivial for Publication; and that Persons, who limit their Perusal to them, will be apt to pronounce unfavourably of the whole. I therefore think it necessary to assign my Reasons for including them, and, at the same Time, give a short Ac∣count of the Work in general.</P>
<P>These Letters are truly, what they are announced in the Title-page, <HI>Genuine.</HI> The Lady, to whom they were written, entrusted me with the Publication. On my first Perusal of them, I thought they contained Matter much too good to be lost. The moral Lessons, wherewith they abound, being chiefly calculated for younger Minds, I took the Liberty in my Proposals to recommend the Work as a
<PB N="xvi" REF="14"/>
proper Companion to the Time of Edu∣cation in both Sexes. Those Letters, which contain Critiques on many celebrated Writers, appeared to me not unworthy the Notice of Men of Reading and Eru∣dition. I revised and transcribed those on <HI>Homer,</HI> in particular, with the Original, and <HI>Pope</HI>'s Translation at my hand, and can, at least, venture to affirm there is a great Deal of <HI>New</HI> in Mr. <HI>Preston</HI>'s Re∣marks. I declare, with great Truth, that I have his Reputation at Heart, more than my own Emolument, and therefore hope, for his Sake, my weak Judgment may not be called in Question.</P>
<P>My Motive for retaining those initiatory Letters, which seem less consequential, were partly in hope that they might have the same good Effect on other Pupils, which they had on his. It may be object∣ed that they contain Rules which are to be found in every French Grammar. Grant∣ed. But, to use a Maxim of our Writer's, may not a Precept or two, scattered in this light, epistolary Manner, have more Force than all the formal Documents that ever were penned? What has been, may be. I am a Witness that his Pupil,
<PB N="xvii" REF="15"/>
profited excellently by this Mode of Instruction; I therefore think the Inser∣tion of them cannot be wholly use∣less; beside that it gives an Opportunity of admiring that kind and easy Pliancy with which a Man of Learning and Ge∣nius descended to the Level of a puerile Comprehension.</P>
<P>I lament that it has not been in my Power to obtain a Sight of the young Lady's Letters. We have her Tutor's Word for her being possessed of good Sense and a Quickness of Apprehension. Her Remarks therefore could not but be en∣tertaining, if not instructive; in-as-much as they came pure and genuine from the Heart, unsophisticated with casuistical Reasonings or Pedantry of Expression. He frequently mentions the Pleasure her Letters afford him; unfortunately they are all wanting: she had the Affliction to lose her Friend and Instructor, when he was many Miles distant from her, and all Attempts to recover his Papers proved fruitless.</P>
<P>To account for the endearing Terms in which the Tutor sometimes addresses his Pupil, be it known he was her <HI>God-Father</HI>;
<PB N="xviii" REF="16"/>
and his unremitted Attention to the Im∣provement of her Mind demonstrates how conscientiously he regarded that impor∣tant Office he undertook at her Baptism, which is too often, by the Generality of Mankind, as iniquitously neglected, as it inconsiderately assumed.</P>
<P>For the Gratification of such Readers, as wish to be more nearly acquainted with Mr. <HI>Preston,</HI> I have prevailed on the Lady, to sketch his Character, which I hereunto subjoin.</P>
<P>I have little more to say. I mean to give an useful Work to the Publick. Should I fail in my Judgment, my Inten∣tion, at least, is good; and however weak my Abilities may be, I have this com∣fortable Reflection, that they are dedicated to a <HI>moral Purpose</HI>; to which Important End I wish that all my little Labours should conduce, as most suitable to my Inclination, and most consistent with my Profession.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER To the EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>YOU ask me for a Character of my rever'd Mr. <HI>P.</HI> You tell me I must hasten, for that the Publication is in great forwardness. Alas, what a Task have you given me! already have I suffered extreme Pain on a Re-perusal of his Let∣ters, which, since his Death, I have never dared to look into, till you encouraged me, by saying they might be of the same Service to others, which they had once been to me. Flattered by this Opinion, I ventured to read them again; all my Affection, all my Gratitude, all my Respect awakens; but all embittered by the Recollection of my Loss; he lives and dies to me again, on this Review of what I owe to him. I am now less equal to the Task you require of me, than I was, when I first delivered the Papers to your Hands. I then deferred writing
<PB N="xx" REF="18"/>
what you wished, through a Consciousness of Incapacity, and a Shame at delivering my Sentiments intentionally to the Press. That Consciousness, that Shame, is now absorbed in my Fears for the sacred Re∣putation of my beloved Teacher; what will an idle, a dissipated Public say of these valuable Letters? Should they be treated with Scorn, or even Disrespect, I shall never forgive myself. Is it not pos∣sible that Persons, without a Tythe of his Understanding, his Education, or his Virtue, will set themselves up for Con∣demners of his Sense, his Literature, and his Morals? Have not I trespassed on the Duty I for ever owe his Memory in run∣ning such a Risque? My Motive must be my Apology; and if the Departed know any thing of the Actions of Survivors, he will know I mean but to pursue his own Plan, of doing as extensive Good as my Power will let me. To that Public, who will shortly receive them, I can only say, the favoured Individual, to whom they were addressed, owes all the little Merit, you, and her other partial Friends have ever ascribed to her (under Heaven) to the Lessons she received from the Au∣thor of these Letters; naturally petulant
<PB N="xxi" REF="19"/>
capricious, obstinate, he knew, with happy Art, how to turn even her Failings to Account; and skillfully used even the <HI>Curvings</HI> of her Temper as Instruments to the Improvement of her Mind. The Letters truly are, what you have an∣nounced them, Genuine; the Writer was a Gentleman of an antient and honourable Family, once of affluent Fortunes; the Name, you have adopted in lieu of his own, indicates the Misfortune of his Life. He was accounted a Man of the first Sense among Men of Sense; his Educa∣tion was compleat, his Literature deep, yet polished; his Taste nice, yet not <HI>cavillous</HI>; (if I may use the Word) his Wit was as sound as his Judgment, and as sweet as his Man∣ners; his Humour was infinite, and harmless as it was pleasant. This was his Character from Men of Standard Judgment; for it is not to be supposed that <HI>I,</HI> at any Time, could be capable of un∣derstanding this Part of it, much less at Sixteen, at which Age I had the Unhappi∣ness to lose him; but what I have repeat∣ed is no more than I have heard of∣ten asserted by Persons of established Re∣putation for Skill in what they spoke of; But his Heart—to describe that, is <HI>properly</HI>
<PB N="xxii" REF="20"/>
my Province. Yet how shall I be equal to it? Pious as a primitive Christian, Chearful in the same Degree he was pious; Benevo∣lent, in the most extensive Sense of the Word; Beneficent, as far as a limited Power would let him; Mild in his Cen∣sures, Strict in his Actions, Charitable in Thought, Word, and Deed; Merciful even to an Infect; Kind not only in In∣tention and Act, but his very Address was Kindness pourtrayed; yet was he, to use his own Words, speaking of Mrs. K. <Q>very resentful, if he conceived himself slighted.</Q> A strong Trait of his Charac∣ter was the Pliancy, with which he yielded to his fallen Fortunes, and the <HI>un</HI>-yielding Spirit with which he supported an Indepen∣dence, in despight of them. If it would not appear too fanciful I should say he united in his Temper the poetical Descrip∣tions of the Ivy and the Oak. The Misfortune hinted at (owing to Educa∣tion and the Principles of his Family early imbibed) in the youthful Part of his Life, depriving him of the Means of providing for a Family equal to their Birth and his Spirit, kept him a single Man; my Father and himself, (involved
<PB N="xxiii" REF="21"/>
in the same Cause, and the same Conse∣quences) were the most intimate Friends; he prevailed on Mr. P. to take Charge of me as a God-Child, an Office he held so sacred, that he never took it on him but for me; and, from that Time, he looked on me as his own, and, I'm sure, felt all the Affection of a Father for me; nor did I ever feel the Loss of one (my own dy∣ing while I was an Infant) till I lost him.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to fulfil your Request; and be assured that neither my Affection or my Gratitude have impelled me to flatter the Character of a Man, whose Worth exceeds the Power of Words. That the precious Deposit, I have com∣mitted to your Care, may meet with such a Reception as the Gentleness of your own Heart and the Goodness of your Intention induces you to think it will, is at present the most fervent Wish</P>

<P>I Have sent you the Original of your two Translations. There are Dif∣ferences between them, that I don't think much of; but pray observe the Nicety
<PB N="7" REF="29"/>
of the French in using the Pronouns <HI>du, de-la, de, en,</HI> and so forth. Observe too that you use the singular for the plural, and sometimes the plural for the singu∣lar. You will fall eternally into this Error, unless you will fix the Conjuga∣tions of Verbs in your Head. Pray ex∣amine the Translation by the Original, Word by Word, and study the Reasons of their Difference; by this Means, you shall become more a Mistress of the French in six Weeks, than you have been in all all your Time hitherto. The Leisure the Country affords, and the little Avocation, you have there, afford an excellent Op∣portunity for this.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="30"/>Why do you say I set you long Tasks? I do not. I bid you take Time, and don't fatigue yourself. Perform them à deux, ou trois reprises, ou a combien vous le voulez; mais ayez garde de les faire tous jours soigneusement.</P>
<P>I design to translate, for your Use, the History of <HI>Nonchalante, Babellarde,</HI> and <HI>Finette</HI>; not only for the sake of the French, but for your Conduct in Life.

<P>I have sent you, on the other Side of this Sheet, your Translation of the last Task I set you, with the Original op∣posite to it.

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last was by Thursday's Post. I received yours Yesterday, in which you excuse the Faults of your Trans∣lations, by pleading, that they are not committed through Carelessness; but surely you don't look into your Grammar, else you would spell more correctly, and observe the Differences of the Numbers and Tenses better.</P>
<P>Your Letters and Translations give me great Pleasure, there is something so much of the French Turn in them.</P>
<P>They are only the most common Things which you oversee. You spell
<PB N="16" REF="38"/>
English as well as a Man of Learning does, and much better than the most Part of your Sex. I would have you as per∣fect at spelling French. I don't expect that your Translations should be equal to the Original. How can that be, when the Translation that I send you, and which you are to render again into the Original, is so widely different from the Original itself? But then I would have you ob∣serve the Difference nicely, as it would make a lasting Impression on your Mind. I would have you make some Paper up in different Folds; then write your own Phrase on one Side, and the French Ori∣ginal on the other, if the Difference is worth noticing; for instance, in this Manner:</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="39"/>You say, Le soin de sa fa∣mille lui chagrina le plus.</P>
<P>The Original, Ce que l'inquietoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> le plus, c'etoit le soin de sa famille.</P>
<P>Yours is not bad French, but then the other is better. If you'll take this Me∣thod, it will infix the most proper and elegant Expression deep in your Mind.</P>
<P>I shall detain you no longer, having many Letters to write. I have enclosed another Paper than I used to send you, though it bears the same Name, because it is more diverting than the former. I shall set you no Task to-day, for I would not chuse to oppress you. I am just going to your Mama's, that, if she thinks fit, she may add a Postscript.</P>

<P>I Received yours of the 4th instant. I am charmed with the Translation. It is the best you have done, and much bet∣ter than I expected. It is impossible
<PB N="19" REF="41"/>
that it can be so good French, as that of so great a Master as <HI>Mons. Perrault</HI>; but, by setting them in Opposition, you see the Difference; and if you will mind it, and keep the Copies, that you may have re∣course to them on occasion, I do not know a better Way to attain to the Purity of the French Language.</P>
<P>In your Letter you say, "La Conside∣ration de cela que vous <HI>faire</HI> pardonner, &amp;c." instead of "que vous <HI>fait</HI> pardon∣ner," and so on, in many Instances, using the Infinitive for the Imperfect of the Indicative Mood. "Ma Tante vous <HI>faire</HI> les Compliments," for vous <HI>fait.</HI>" These Mistakes are so obvious, that nothing but Carelessness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She has endeavoured to exculpate herself from the Charge of Carelessness, yet here she is again arraigned for it. Probably she was unconscious of it. She did not mean to be inattentive, and was only hurried on by early Warmth, and wished, if possible, to attain the Essence of Learning, with∣out the necessary Forms that lead to it. Such In∣stances are not uncommon.</NOTE> can make you fall into
<PB N="20" REF="42"/>
them. Vous ne devez pas vous pleindre de peu de Capacité, parceque vous l'avez belle et bonne; et vous en etes bien rede∣vable à Dieu.</P>
<P>You should carefully remark the prin∣cipal Differences between the French and English Manner of Speech. This is what we call different <HI>Dialects.</HI> It is im∣possible to enumerate them, they are so many; but the greatest arise out of these Particles <HI>ou, en, du, des, de,</HI> &amp;c. When we would say, A thing is generally re∣ported, we use this indefinite Expression, "It is said," or. "They say." The
<PB N="21" REF="43"/>
French say, "On dit." We say "At that time." They say, "Du temps." We say, <HI>"In Europe."</HI> They say, "Of <HI>Europe."</HI> We say, "I have got a Fever." They say, "A Fever has taken me." Then the Use of <HI>à</HI> or <HI>de</HI> before the Infini∣tive is very hard to be distinguished with∣out great Care; as you will see by com∣paring the last Translation with the Ori∣ginal. In like Manner, the Difference is difficult between <HI>en</HI> and <HI>dans</HI>; when the Adverb <HI>ne</HI> is to be used, and when not. We say, "He is richer than you think, &amp;c." The French say, "He is richer than you don't think." Then we have an auxiliary Verb, which they want, and which adds great Force and Energy to our Expression on some Occasions; and that is the Verb <HI>do.</HI> When we aver a
<PB N="22" REF="44"/>
Thing with Vehemence, we say, "I <HI>do</HI> say so—I <HI>do</HI> think so." This is much stronger than to utter simply, "I say so—I think so." You may observe the Force of this auxiliary <HI>do</HI> in many other Expres∣sions.</P>

<P>ON the other Side you have your Translation, and on the next, the Original. Pray mark the Difference;
<PB N="23" REF="45"/>
for though yours is much better than I expected, yet you'll find in the other a shorter Way of Expression. My Trans∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, which was impossible to be made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iterally from the French, has occasioned a greater Difference between yours and the original French, than would have been otherwise. Besides, though you sometimes use Words different from the Author, that is nothing; your Words have the same Meaning.</P>
<P>You'll observe, you sometimes mistake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Gender. I shall only notice two In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tances. <HI>You</HI> say, "Rien de si <HI>indolente</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u'etoit <HI>Nonchalante."</HI> The <HI>Author</HI> says, Rien de fi indolent; your Mistake is, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink <HI>indolent</HI> agrees with <HI>Nonchalante,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd therefore you put it in the Feminine
<PB N="24" REF="46"/>
Gender; but it agrees with <HI>rien</HI> and so should have been in the Masculine.</P>
<P>The next thing is, you say, "Le même Longeur du Temps." This is a stiff Ex∣pression, besides it is an Anglicism. <HI>We</HI> say, "The same Length of Time;" but the <HI>French</HI> say, "Assez long Temps." Moreover this Expression is so natural and usual, that I wonder you endea∣voured to find out another.</P>
<P>I have no more Faults to find, only in the Spelling; but the Translation is so well in the main, that I will send you some little Present for it.</P>

<P>I HAVE the Pleasure of yours of the 20th and shewed it to your Mama, who was writing to you in the mean Time, but I suppose her Letter don't reach you till this Night.</P>
<P>You certainly do not remark the Dif∣ferences between the Original and your Translation, or you would not fall so often into Faults which are so obvious. You frequently mix Substantives and Ad∣jectives of different Genders together, and Nouns and Verbs of different Num∣bers. I have reproved you twice for that word <HI>mis,</HI> which you use both in
<PB N="29" REF="51"/>
the singular and plural Number, and yet you have it twice in the last Transla∣tion.</P>
<P>I remarked to you formerly, that you used the perfect Time, when the im∣perfect was more proper; and if you had but compared the Original with your own Translation, you would have found it, as I said. You are to observe, as I told you before, when you speak of a particular Thing done some time ago, you should use the perfect: but when you speak of a Thing usually done, the imperfect. For Example:</P>
<P>"Elle mettoit l'Ordre dans la Maison du Roi." That is, she <HI>used</HI> to do it. But when it is only a peculiar Action done <HI>once</HI> or at a <HI>certain</HI> Time,</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="52"/>"Elle mit l'Ordre," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Observe also, that they do not use the Word <HI>avec</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> in so extensive a Sense, as we do <HI>with</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> What we translate into <HI>with</HI> is sometimes à, sometimes <HI>de</HI> in French.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the true Idiom of a Language is generally the last Point which is learned, and requires a greater Degree of Comprehension than is necessary for un∣derstanding a plain grammatical Rule, I hope this Passage will not be deemed too trifling to have been retained. It is possible that a young Mind might receive a deeper Impression from meeting a Rule thus in the Course of a Letter, than in the formal Mode of Instruction.</NOTE> Remark too they say, <HI>La Cadette de ces deux,</HI> we say, "The youngest of the three." The Sense is the same, though the Expression is somewhat different; for <HI>Cadette</HI> signi∣fies properly, one that is younger. <HI>Le Cadet,</HI> for Example, is <HI>the younger Brother,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="53"/>
whereas <HI>Cadette</HI> in this Place, implies <HI>the Sister, who was younger than the other two.</HI></P>
<P>When they talk of any Thing that we learn they use <HI>scavoir,</HI> instead of <HI>pouvoir,</HI> as you may see in the Original, and it is worth your Observarion.</P>
<P>I cannot say but the Translation has the <HI>true Spirit</HI> of French in it; for this reason, it vexes me to see you fail in the commonest Things. I shall not trouble you with a new Exercise till Saturday, that you may consider what I have re∣marked in this and my fomer Letters, with Care and Diligence.</P>

<P>YOU still continue to use the singular Verb for the plural. Is not this Negligence in the highest Degree? These little Faults apart, the Translation is ad∣mirable, by far the best you ever made, and you improve in every one. I grant it is your Application to write fine French, that makes you neglect common Things; but then it looks ugly to see such good French defective in the very first Princi∣ples, that a Beginner would be ashamed of. I do not think <HI>il causoit,</HI> for <HI>il faisoit,</HI> good French. Pray observe the Arange∣ment of the Original, and compare it with your Translation. You say, <HI>il fit

l'Infidelité de cet Homme de retomber</HI>—They say, <HI>il fit retomber l'Infidelité,</HI> &amp;c.

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Letter yesternight, and am charmed with it. It is written with Sense and Spirit, and in an easy fa∣miliar
<PB N="48" REF="70"/>
Stile, as all Letters should be writ∣ten. The Writing too is good, the Lines strait, and the Paper kept free from Blurs or Blots. These Particulars give me Pleasure. Pray persevere in this Care and Attention. Good Habits are full as easy to be attained and preserved as bad ones. The only Point is to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t out in a right Way at first, and enter upon it with Determination.</P>
<P>I would have you, by all Means, pur∣chase the <HI>Archbishop of Cambray's Dia∣logues des Morts,</HI> with the Fables and Lives of the antient Philosophers: they are all bound up together in one Volume. It is an excellent Book; and though one would think that you, a young Girl, should have little to do with the Lives
<PB N="49" REF="71"/>
of old Philosophers, yet you cannot fail of finding many Things, which will be of vast Advantage to you, if you duly observe them. You will perceive that even the greatest Men were subject to gross Failings and Follies; but the main Points to claim your Observation, are those wise Rules and Maxims that were established among them, some by one, some by ano∣ther, and the salutary Observations they made of Men and Things. These, if you consider them, will be of great Service to you in the Conduct of Life.</P>
<P>I would have you, my Dear, to read often the Proverbs of <HI>Solomon,</HI> the <HI>Eccle∣siastes, Ecclesiasticus,</HI> and the <HI>Wisdom of the Son of Sirach.</HI> There are few Books, which I know, fit to be compared
<PB N="50" REF="72"/>
with them for Instructions to make us wise and happy.</P>
<P>I would likewise recommend to you the 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th Satires of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> and the 2d of <HI>Persius</HI>; and that you would think well and often on them.</P>
<P>Preserve still that Goodness and Sweet∣ness of Temper, of which you are so much Mistress; and that Modesty, Hu∣mility, and Freedom from Affectation, Pride, and Vanity, which, without Flatte∣ry, are so remarkable in you. Persevere unceasingly in Affection and Obedience to your Mother, in Kindness and Compas∣sion to your Fellow-Creatures, and, above all, in the Fear and Love of God; there
<PB N="51" REF="73"/>
will be then no Danger but that you will find People who will love and esteem you, nay, very probably, even pique themselves on serving you, and be proud to be thought your Friends and Bene∣factors.</P>
<P>Let me hear from you often, my Dear: write freely. Let me always know what you are about, and what happens to you. I long to hear that you are gone into the Country, lest you should not be in Time to see Mrs. F—before she leaves it. She is a most deserving Woman, and I could wish to make you acquainted with her. An Intimacy with a Person of real Merit, is one great Blessing of Life: they who live longest perceive this most. Inform me when you set out,

and I will send you a Letter of Intro∣duction.</P>
<P>There is a little Book, called the <HI>Duke of Rochefoucault</HI>'s Maxims, full of excel∣lent Observations on the World and hu∣man Life. I would have you procure this little Treatise, either in French or English, as you can best meet with it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxford,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 17, 1742.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have your agreeable Letter of the 14th instant, and would have answer∣ed it before, but that I have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gaged lately in a little Business, which has prevented my writing to you so often as I intended.</P>
<P>You want to have long Letters from me; I want the same Thing from you. I wish you had been particular about your Visit to Mr. and Mrs. F—, and that you had let me know the Subject your Conversation turned upon. You don't tell me if Mr. W—has sent the <HI>Arch∣bishop
<PB N="56" REF="78"/>
of Cambray</HI>'s Book, nor what you think of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s Maxims; but as you are deeply engaged in <HI>Homer,</HI> I can easily excuse that.</P>
<P>There are infinite Beauties in <HI>Homer</HI>; and though all Translations must, in some Respects, fall short of so great an Original, yet I think Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> pre∣serves the Life and Soul, and Fire of it, in a great Degree. There is not such a vast Warmth and Ardour in <HI>Virgil,</HI> but then there is such a Beauty, and, I may say, Loveliness in him, as passes all De∣scription; nor is it possible for the Heart of a Reader, who is ignorant of this Ori∣ginal, to form any Manner of Idea of it. When you read <HI>Pope</HI>'s Translation, you read something like <HI>Homer</HI> himself; but
<PB N="57" REF="79"/>
when you read <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Translation of <HI>Virgil,</HI> you can scarce have any Notion or Image of his genuine Excellencies. No Painter ever gave more fine and lively Expression to a Picture, or with more Exactness and Judgment, than <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> gives to his Descriptions. Nay, if you saw the Thing itself represented be∣fore you, it would scarcely make a deeper Impression. Yet I do not hereby presume to aver that <HI>Dryden</HI> was a Poet inferior to <HI>Pope,</HI> but he was old, and not à <HI>son Aise,</HI> when he translated <HI>Virgil.</HI> A bet-Excuse however may be brought for him; namely, that neither our Lan∣guage, nor (to my Belief) any other Language in the World, can come up to the Beauty, Elegance and Energy of the matchless Original.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="80"/>Though no one can read <HI>Homer,</HI> who has any (though ever so little) Elevation of Fancy, without being charmed with him, yet if we are let into his great Design, the Structure and Contrivance of his Fable, the Plot, Conduct, and Execution of the Whole, with what the Criticks call the Characters, the Sentiments, Dic∣tion, Figures, Descriptions, &amp;c. I say, when these Things are duly known, we shall have a much greater Pleasure in read∣ing him, than otherwise we can possi∣bly attain.</P>
<P>If you will read <HI>Pope</HI>'s Introduction to the <HI>Iliad,</HI> with Care, it will prove of great Use to you. You should also make yourself acquainted with his Notes; but in order to have a just Conception of this
<PB N="59" REF="81"/>
Stile of Writing. it is necessary to pay great Attention to <HI>Bossu</HI>'s Treatise of Epick Poetry. It is commended as the most judicious Essay on that Subject, that ever was written; and though it be of little Use to us, till we are somewhat acquainted with Epick Poetry, yet, once dipped into that excellent Way of Writing, it is of infinite Service to give us a true Taste for it. We should experience the Advantage of it, in a high Degree, through the <HI>Iliad,</HI> the <HI>Odys∣sey,</HI> the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and <HI>Paradise Lost.</HI> Many other Epick Poems are written, which perhaps may as well be let alone as read. I except some prose Performances, such as <HI>Telemaque. Tasso</HI>'s <HI>Jerusalem de∣livered</HI> has been recommended to me
<PB N="60" REF="82"/>
well worth reading: it was originally written in Italian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am apt to think Mr. <HI>Preston</HI> was not singular in having lived many Years ignorant of this beautiful Production. Within the small Circle of my Acquaintance, I have been amazed, on quoting <HI>Tasso's Jerusalem,</HI> to find several Persons of exquisite Taste, and Lovers of reading, utter Strangers to the very Name. It is surely an ad∣mirable Poem, and should be universally known.</NOTE>. There is, however, I am told, an old Translation of it into English, by <HI>Edward Fairfax,</HI> which I am going to read forthwith. A Friend, on whose Taste and Judgment I can de∣pend, assures me it is an admirable Work, abounding with exquisite Poetry, and all the Spirit of an Original. <HI>Statius,</HI> who certainly had a great poetic Genius, wrote an Heroic Poem in Latin, called the <HI>Thebaid</HI>; but it falls so infinitely short of <HI>Virgil</HI> in some Particulars, and
<PB N="61" REF="83"/>
perhaps in <HI>all</HI> (except in his Fire, of which <HI>Statius</HI> had a large Portion) that his Poem and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s are often opposed to each other in <HI>Bossu,</HI> by way of contrast; so that you may there see close and nice Examples of Judiciousness and Injudici∣ousness, Beauties and Defects. It might be of great Advantage to you, to have <HI>Statius</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> before you, when you read <HI>Bossu,</HI> that you might immediately consult the Originals, when any remark∣able Quotation is made. There is some Part of the <HI>Thebaid</HI> translated by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> but I do not know if the whole is rendered into English by any Hand. Now if you are inclined to read <HI>Bossu,</HI> I will send it to you.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="84"/>There are some noble Beauties in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> which I have, with great Ac∣curacy, observed. Perhaps the chief of them may have been noticed by other People; however as they are <HI>my own,</HI> and not borrowed from, though they may resemble, others, I flatter myself they may not be unwelcome to you.</P>
<P>To begin with <HI>Homer.</HI> We are to consider in the first Place, what was his Design or End in writing an He∣roick Poem, abstracted entirely from the Tendency of the Work.</P>
<P>The End this Poet proposed to himself, perhaps, was to procure Praise, perhaps, Profit. The latter has been too often the Case of Poets, and if the Tradition be
<PB N="63" REF="85"/>
true, that <HI>Homer</HI> was blind and poor, it might have been the same with him. <HI>Horace</HI> ingenuously confesses of himself,
<Q><L>Paupertas impulit audax</L>
<L>Ut Versus facerem—<HI>to wit,</HI></L>
<L>Poverty, which is impudent, compelled me</L>
<L>to write Verses.</L></Q>
Yet when we consider the Sublimity, and almost Divinity of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Writings, we are surely tempted to think that he was not poor; if he was, how much is he to be admired and revered, who scorned to stoop to low disgraceful Subjects, by which, however, he might possibly have obtained an easier and more plentiful Subsistence, than by producing such a laborious, sublime and useful Work!</P>
<P>It is probable that the <HI>Aeneid</HI> was wrote with a Design to compliment <HI>Augustus
<PB N="64" REF="86"/>
Caesar,</HI> and procure his Favour. Allow∣ing this, I cannot but think that <HI>Virgil</HI> pleased himself, at the same Time, with the Beauty and Loveliness of the Charac∣ters and Descriptions he gave us; and in the Reflection of having endeavoured to make Mankind better, by representing the Excellence of Virtue, and Detestabi∣lity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe this is a Word of Mr. <HI>Preston</HI>'s own Coining, but the Strength and Application of it appeared to me to carry the Apology with them. It cannot be objectionable, I presume, to any but a Caviller. A liberal Judge scorns, on every flight Occasion, ta make a cold Appeal to a Dic∣tionary. Not but, in my humble Opinion, the Word, though not to be found, is very justifiable in grammatical Propriety. We have <HI>Placability,</HI> us well as <HI>placable,</HI> and why not <HI>Detestability,</HI> as well as <HI>detestable?</HI> And are not such Liberties (so long as they do not contradict Reason and Proba∣bility) not only allowable, but Praise-worthy, in-as-much as they contribute to enlarge and en∣rich our Language?</NOTE> of Vice, in their distinct Colours.</P>
<P>You perceive hereby that we are to distinguish between the End an Author
<PB N="65" REF="87"/>
proposes to himself by his Work, and that which he proposes to the World. The general Design and Tendency may be equally to amuse and improve Mankind; the particular Tendency, to inculcate some useful Truth in the Minds of those Per∣sons, for whom the Work was chiefly written.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> founds, his Subject on the Actions and Sufferings of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> from the De∣struction of <HI>Troy,</HI> till he settled, a new Empire in <HI>Italy</HI>; and the Lesson, to be deduced from it, seems to be, the great Efficacy of a due Mixture of active and
<PB N="66" REF="88"/>
passive Virtues. His <HI>Aeneas</HI> is wise, just, pious, valiant, good-natured, patient, and firm to his Purpose. These Virtues carry him, at last, through all his Diffi∣culties; but his Patience and Piety, seem most important to him. This is nicely judicious in the Author, to make the Hero owe his Happiness to his unre∣pining Endurance of Hardships, his im∣plicit Submission to the Will of Heaven, and his pious Affection for his Father, his Son, his Friends, and his People; hence he is beloved of them all; and we find, notwithstanding his long Sufferings, he was the peculiar Care of Heaven.</P>
<P>Man is not a faultless Being. <HI>Virgil</HI> therefore did not chuse to draw his Hero out of Nature. He has described him with the Imperfections of a human Be∣ing.
<PB N="67" REF="89"/>
He is very culpable in his Behavi∣our to <HI>Dido.</HI> This is his great Fault; but you see, the Author has judiciously attributed that to him, which the greatest of Men are liable to, and the best of Men sometimes fall into. <HI>Aeneas</HI> how∣ever acted not half so bad a Part by <HI>Dido,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> did with respect to <HI>Bathsheba</HI> and <HI>Uriah</HI>; and yet you see, it cost <HI>Aeneas</HI> very dear, and it was not without great Grief and Anguish of Heart, that he ex∣tricated himself at last. Supposing the Story to be true, a Man of so much Goodness of Disposition as <HI>Aeneas,</HI> must have had many bitter Reflections, during the whole Course of his Life, for his Be∣haviour at <HI>Carthage,</HI> and the fatal Event which attended it.</P>
<P><HI>Dido</HI> stands a great Example to all Ages of the Danger and Ruin a Woman
<PB N="68" REF="90"/>
of Virtue exposes herself to, who ven∣tures to give way, though ever so slightly, to the first Advances towards illicit Love. To your Sex she should be a perpe∣tual Warning. It is worth your while to set the Picture before you. We will forget the <HI>Queen,</HI> and consider her as more Woman. We find her struggle with her Inclination, at first, and even swear against giving way to her Passion; yet she listened with Pleasure to every thing <HI>Aeneas</HI> said. By Degrees she is overcome. She then throws off all Re∣serve and Shame; neglects her Affairs, gadds about with him from Place to Place, throwing aside all the Decorum of her Sex and Situation; rides and hunts with him. At length, poor Wo∣man! she finds he is going to forsake her.
<PB N="69" REF="91"/>
She storms and threatens, weeps, and in∣treats by Fits; now sends a resentful, now a submissive Message. He answers all with Respect, and Good-manners, but at he same Time, with Coldness and Indif∣ference. This Treatment fills her with Agony unspeakable. Rest and Sleep are utter Strangers to her. At length, he de∣parts from <HI>Carthage</HI>; then she becomes distracted, exposes herself to the whole City, execrates herself for not having de∣stroyed him, his Son and herself; she then sinks again into Complaints and Lamentations, till she is lost in Despair, and resolves to sacrifice her Life. Posses∣sed with this horrid Determination, she becomes outrageous, and flies through her Apartments with the Looks and Fury
<PB N="70" REF="92"/>
of a Fiend, devoting him and his Po∣sterity to endless Torments. The Pre∣sents he had made her then meet her Eyes; she dissolves into Tears at the Sight, and moans, in painful Recollection, over the happy Hours she had passed with him. Unable longer to endure the Va∣riety of Torments that surround her, she slays herself with a Sword, which had belonged to the Author of them, and in the Agonies of Death throws her∣self on the rich Apparel he had left be∣hind him. Be it not forgot that, in this Act of Despair, she placed the Picture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that in some capital Paint∣ings of the Death of <HI>Dido,</HI> this very natural and striking Circumstance of the Picture is omitted by the Artists.</NOTE> of her Lover on the funeral Pile.

<P>THE Beauties, and various Incidents in the Fourth Book of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> engaged me so closely, as to make me

postpone what I should before have ob∣served, namely the Tendency of this most noble Poem. I now come to it.</P>
<P>Near the Beginning of the first Book, <HI>Virgil</HI> makes this Reflection, "So great a Task was it to found the Roman Em∣pire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Tantae Molis erat Romanam condere Gentem;</Q> <P>So it runs in the Original, and in <HI>Dryden</HI>;</P> <Q><L>Such Time, such Toil requir'd the Roman Name,</L><L>Such Length of Labour for so vast a Frame.</L></Q></NOTE>."

Piety and Gratitude towards the Gods; those Gods, who had fought for them, who had led them through so many Dangers and Difficulties, and, after such severe Encounters with other Nations, and even with some of the Deities themselves who were Enemies to the <HI>Trojans,</HI> had, at last, set∣tled them in that fine Country of <HI>Italy,</HI> and from small Beginnings had enabled them to grow up to such a Height as per∣haps the World had never seen before, nor ever shall again.</P>
<P>If this was <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Design (and surely it is very probable) how agreeable is it to what we find in holy Writ! <HI>Jacob</HI> says,</P>
<Q><PB N="75" REF="97"/>I have passed over this Brook with my Staff, and now I am become two Bands.</Q>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> tells the Israelites, that they were the fewest of all People, and God had made them a mighty and a strong Nation. This is in order to excite in them Gratitude and Piety. <HI>David,</HI> in a hundred Places, mentions the Assistance of God, whereby, from a low and de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>picable Estate, he was become great and mighty.</P>
<Q><P>I am poor and needy, but the Lord careth for me.</P>
<P>He teacheth my Hands to fight.</P>
<P>A Bow of Brass is broken by my Arms.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="98"/>By my God I shall leap over a Wall.</P>
<P>He subdueth the People under me.</P></Q>
<P><Q>As the Lord liveth, who hath re∣deemed my Soul out of all Adversity.</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Virgil,</HI> when he wrote his <HI>Aeneid,</HI> seems to have been possessed of the same Sentiments as those of <HI>David, Moses</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> It appears manifestly so by the Spirit, which runs through his whole Work.</P>
<P>We find him every where in love with Piety, Prudence, Patience, Constancy of Mind, Modesty, Humanity, Candour and in short with all that is praise-worthy. He has beside a Passion for the Belles-Let∣tres,
<PB N="77" REF="99"/>
and Arts and Sciences, in general; and by his Maxims, recommends a sober, industrious Life and Contentment with a little, rather than we should prostitute our∣selves, and our Principles for Gain; so that this noble Work is not only a fine Poem, but moreover a compleat System of Morality.</P>
<P>Not only the Virtues above-mention∣ed are recommended, and placed in a favourable Light, throughout the whole Work, but their contrary Vices are branded with Infamy and Detestation, al∣ways hurtful, if not fatal to the Persons, possessed of them. The Author makes Virtue and Piety carry People through all Difficulties; that is, in most Instances, but he has peculiar Exceptions. He knew too much of the World and of Nature,
<PB N="78" REF="100"/>
to make it always so. This would have been contradictory to Experience, and even his own Maxims; for he frequently gives us plain Intimations, that it often pleases Providence to do, and bring about Things, which we cannot account for. You may remember, for Instance, that at the Burning of <HI>Troy, Aeneas</HI> lost his wife, <HI>Creusa,</HI> in the Confusion. He re∣turned, and went again through all his Dangers, in quest of her. At last, she <HI>appears</HI> to him, and desires him to em∣ploy no more Sollicitude about her, for he was never to see her again. She adds, that such Things do not happen but by the Will and Ordination of Heaven; in∣timating that it was the great Mother of the Gods, who had detained her in those Parts, purposely that she might not
<PB N="79" REF="101"/>
be enslaved by the Greeks. Lastly, she recommends, with great Earnestness, their Son <HI>Ascanius</HI> to his Care, the com∣mon Pledge of their Love. Now, to ask why a virtuous affectionate Cou∣ple should be so dreadfully separated, and why <HI>Creusa</HI> should perish in <HI>Troy,</HI> who had not deserved it by any Crime, were to ask a presumptuous and an impious Ques∣tion, allowing the Story to be true. It was undoubtedly to answer some great and better Purpose, intentionally con∣cealed from our weak Judgments; and this is the Lesson, which <HI>Virgil</HI> means to give us. <HI>Creusa</HI>'s tender Concern for her Child is most affectingly natural, and the Reality has been verified in the Deathbed Farewel of many worthy Wives.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="102"/>Will you permit me to digress one Moment, to mark to you a Beauty of this Kind in our great dramatic Bard, our <HI>Shakespeare?</HI> In the third Act of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> when the <HI>Ghost</HI> appears to the Prince and his Mother in the Closet, "to whet his almost-blunted Purpose," he sudden∣ly breaks from that, to a tender Con∣cern and Compassion for the Queen's Si∣tuation,
<Q><L>But see, Amazement on thy Mother sits,</L>
<L>O step between her, and her fighting Soul;</L>
<L>Conceit in weakest Bodies strongest works.</L>
<L>Speak to her, Hamlet.</L></Q>
This Solicitude for the Sufferings of one, who in Life was dear, surviving the Grave, is most inexpressibly beautiful.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="103"/>To return to <HI>Virgil:</HI> don't you think, Nancy, that if he had lived since Popery came into the World, the Roman Ca∣tholics would have said that the Mother of the Gods detaining <HI>Creusa,</HI> meant that the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> had taken her into her especial Service?</P>
<P>Whenever this Author makes virtuous Persons suffer, it is necessary that you should observe, he makes them guilty of some Fault, which naturally brings on their Distresses; and it is to such Fault yon must attribute them, abstractedly from their good Qualities. I shall give you a short Instance or two.</P>
<P>The hopeful, the beautiful, the vir∣tuous <HI>Pallas,</HI> was killed untimely, in
<PB N="82" REF="104"/>
the very Bloom of his Youth; so was the charming young <HI>Euryalus,</HI> the only Joy of his Mother, as the other was the only Hope of his Father, <HI>Lausus</HI> met also the same Destiny, the worthy Son of an unworthy Father.</P>
<P>Now while you pity them, consider they were all three too rash. The Heat of Youth carried them beyond the Bounds of Prudence: they all loved their Pa∣rents, and were beloved by them with great Tenderness; but that Heat and Impetuosity rendered them disobedient. <HI>Pallas</HI>'s Eagerness made him <HI>break his Promise</HI> to his Father. The Case was much the same with <HI>Lausus</HI>; after he had saved his Father's Life, his Eagerness prevented his attending him, though of∣ten and often sent for. <HI>Euryalus</HI> under∣took
<PB N="83" REF="105"/>
an Exploit above his Years, and that without taking Leave of an affec∣tionate Mother. Much is to be learn∣ed from these Examples; for though <HI>Virgil</HI> does not expressly say, they suf∣fered on these Accounts, yet he plainly insinuates it. Again, the impious Fa∣ther of <HI>Lausus</HI> is forced to confess that his Wickedness was the original Cause of his Son's Loss, and owns it to be a just Judgment on him.</P>
<P>By these Examples <HI>Virgil</HI> teaches us how dangerous it is to fail in a Point of Duty to Parents, albeit through the mere Frailty of our Nature, and nei∣ther out of Contempt nor Stubbornness of Temper.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 23, 1742.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE infinite Beauties of <HI>Virgil</HI> have carried me so much farther than I in∣tended, that, if I can prevail upon myself, I shall contract what I have to say further on this Subject into a narrow Compass; though there are so many Charms in this glorious Poem, that I scarce know how to quit it.</P>
<P>To point out all the Excellencies of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> it would be necessary to repeat the whole Poem. I will therefore only touch on some of those Passages
<PB N="85" REF="107"/>
which please me most, and are, what I judge, the chief Beauties.</P>
<P>In the first Book, we may remark his meeting with his Mother under the Fi∣gure of a Huntress, his going to <HI>Carthage,</HI> the Reception which the Queen gave him, and her becoming enamoured of him; and the Artifice which <HI>Venus</HI> used for that Purpose.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Sinon,</HI> in the second Book, the Return of <HI>Aeneas</HI> to seek his Wife, his Interview and Conversation with her Spirit, and the affectionate Care and Anxiety he testified for his Father, his Son and whole Family, are very affecting.</P>
<P>How striking are his Adventures and Distresses through the whole third Book,
<PB N="86" REF="108"/>
but particularly his Encounter with <HI>He∣lenus</HI> and <HI>Andromache!</HI> How natural was all that happened on that Event! The Story of <HI>Achaemenides,</HI> the <HI>Cyclopes,</HI> and the Description of <HI>Aetna!</HI></P>
<P>In the fourth Book, the whole Process of the Loves of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Dido,</HI> with their fatal Consequences, are beyond all Parallel, all Power of Imitation.</P>
<P>In the fifth, the funeral Games are in∣troduced in Honour of <HI>Anchises,</HI> particu∣larly the Mock-fight of the Children, called Ludus Trojanus. These are fol∣lowed by the burning of the Ships and Behaviour of the Matrons.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="109"/>The whole sixth Book is inexpressi∣bly fine; his meeting with <HI>Dido,</HI> and their mutual Behaviour thereon; his encountering <HI>Deiphobus</HI> and his Father, and having the Ghosts of his Posterity shewn him, are all most awefully af∣fecting. <HI>Shakespeare</HI> seems to have imi∣tated this last Circumstance in his <HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>How well does he describe the Joys of Heaven and Hell, and what Sort of Inhabitants are to be found in each Place! The chief in Heaven are those, who have suffered Wounds and Death for their Country; Priests who have lived a holy Life, becoming their Profession; and Bards who have written and sung in pious Strains, not unworthy of the
<PB N="88" REF="110"/>
Gods; intimating, that those who pros∣titute such sublime Talents to mean and vitious Purposes, deserve nor the Care of Heaven. Next in Degree to these are Persons who have employed their Life in Arts and Inventions, for the Be∣nefit of Mankind, and such as have dis∣tinguished themselves by doing good.</P>
<P>In the other State, he allots the greatest Share of Misery to those, who, when alive, hated their Brethren. Herein the Writer agrees exactly with what our <HI>Saviour</HI> said to <HI>Peter</HI> about forgiving his Brother, and what is likewise inculcat∣ed in many other Parts of Scripture. St. <HI>John</HI> says,</P>
<Q><PB N="89" REF="111"/>He that sayeth he loveth God, and hateth his Brother, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</Q>
<P>We next behold those who have re∣jected their Parents, defrauded their De∣pendants, and deceived such as confided in them; after which come those who have sate brooding over their Gold, and refused to share it with the needy; those who have sold their Country for mercenary Ends, have wrested the Laws, and destroyed the Constitution; and those who have dared to be guilty of Adul∣tery or Incest. To what noble Purposes, my dear Nancy, does this visionary Scene conduce! How admirably has <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Fancy and Morality gone Hand in Hand!</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="112"/>Do you not admire that charming De∣scription, in the seventh Book, of the different Nations who came as Allies to the War, which was impending? Their Behaviour, Habits, Arms, Customs, how infinitely entertaining! and particularly, the charming Picture of <HI>Camilla,</HI> the fe∣male Warrior, and her Troop of Ladies.</P>
<P>The great Events in the ensuing Part of the Work are, <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Visit to <HI>Evan∣der,</HI> the Conversation and Consequences, the simple Way of Life pursued by that old Prince, the Story of <HI>Cacus,</HI> and that of <HI>Nisus</HI> and <HI>Euryalus,</HI> the Praises of <HI>Her∣cules,</HI> the Speeches of <HI>Turnus</HI> and <HI>Dran∣ces,</HI> and the Deaths of <HI>Pallas, Camilla,</HI> and <HI>Lausus.</HI> What noble Fire and Spi∣rit does he display, when he describes the
<PB N="91" REF="113"/>
Conflict between <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Turnus!</HI> and how sublime are the Sentiments of the latter, when he discovers that he had been pursuing a Spectre, instead of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and again, when he is about to expire. These, my dear Nancy, are such great and beautiful Passages, as ap∣pear to rise in your Estimation, the more you consider, and the oftner you pe∣ruse them.</P>
<P>It is worth your while also to observe how humane a Man, and how fine a Gen∣tleman, <HI>Virgil</HI> appears throughout his whole Work. With what Pleasure does he dwell on Instances of Piety, pater∣nal Love, filial Duty, conjugal Affec∣tion, Humanity, Hospitality, and every social Virtue! With what apparent De∣light
<PB N="92" REF="114"/>
does he speak of a lovely Child, or a promising Youth! We see Instances of this in his <HI>Ascanius, Astyanax, Eurya∣lus, Pallas,</HI> and <HI>Lausus.</HI></P>
<P>He seems to describe, with no less Par∣ticipation of Joy, Examples of fond ten∣der Parents, in <HI>Aeneas, Evander, Creusa Andromache, Amata,</HI> and the Mother of <HI>Euryalus.</HI> He instructs us in the Know∣ledge of human Nature, (wherein he was deeply skilled) by painting the Love and Concern for a worthy Son, in the savage and impious Mind of <HI>Mezentius.</HI> We may hence derive some very important Truths and Lessons. We learn first that Love to our Children is so inherent, that Persons who acknowledge no other Claim, who feel no other Call of Na∣ture,
<PB N="93" REF="115"/>
and who are actually guilty of great Faults, in other Respects, still pre∣serve their Duty and Affection here. We learn beside that Worth and Goodness will always be beloved and admired, and extort some Degree of Approbation, even from the most unfeeling Heart. Had the Son of <HI>Mezentius</HI> been less de∣serving, probably his Father would not have mourned his Loss to such Excess; <HI>Aeneas</HI> not so strongly regretted having killed him; nor would <HI>Virgil</HI> have be∣wailed him in such Terms, as (to use the Expression of <HI>Horace</HI>) "were worth his dying for." He lost his Life through his Excess of Virtue; he was alarmed with Grief and Fear at Sight of his Fa∣ther's Danger, rushed between him and <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and preserved his Parent. By
<PB N="94" REF="116"/>
this we are taught another useful Truth; namely, that no Fault of a Parent can supersede the Duty of a Child. He might have escaped, after he had preserved his Father; but Rashness, so incident to Youth, drove him to venture beyond his Strength. <HI>Aeneas</HI> fore-warned him; he was deaf to this humane Advice, and his Death was the natural Con∣sequence.</P>
<P>How finely natural is the Interview between <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> the Wi∣dow of <HI>Hector</HI> and Mother of <HI>Astyanax!</HI> It is worth your while to place them plainly and exactly before you. She weeps; he stands amazed, and can hard∣ly <HI>hiss</HI> out (such is the literal Meaning of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Expression) a few Words.
<PB N="95" REF="117"/>
When she has Power of Utterance, she expatiates on many Subjects at once; she relates the Story of her Life since the taking of <HI>Troy,</HI> then enquires of his; then questions him about his Son, if he was not a promising Youth, if he did not copy after him and his Uncle <HI>Hec∣tor?</HI> and if he did not take to Heart the Death of his Mother? At parting from <HI>Aeneas,</HI> she takes Leave of <HI>Asca∣nius</HI>; she calls him the very Picture of her poor <HI>Astyanax:</HI> she discovers the same Countenance, Eyes, and Hands, and that, had he happily survived, he would have been of the same Growth. This is the very Strength and Beauty of Nature, whose Workings and Effects are the same in all Degrees of Life. Our Stations may be different, but our Feel∣ings are alike.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="118"/><HI>Virgil</HI> not only dwells upon the Duty of Children to their Parents, but even to their Nurses, to those who have had the Care of their Infancy. He recommends this, and exalts the Character of his Hero, at the same Time. That Part of the Coast of <HI>Italy,</HI> where the Nurse of <HI>Aeneas</HI> was buried, was called after her Name, and the pious Hero bestowed on her an honourable Funeral.</P>
<P>How pleasing is the Description of <HI>Anna</HI>'s Nurse (whom <HI>Dido</HI> treated with the same Tenderness as she would her own, who was deceased) with an Intent and busy Air labouring to execute the Queen's Orders; <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Expression is "Studio anili;" that is, with that Cau∣tion
<PB N="97" REF="119"/>
and Concern, so peculiar to her Age and Office.</P>
<P>Our Author appears also as partially fond of his old Men, who are good and pious; his <HI>Priam, Anchises, Evander,</HI> and <HI>Butes. Priam</HI> is the first Man to encourage <HI>Sinon,</HI> and <HI>Anchises</HI> is the same to <HI>Achaemenides.</HI> You see the Care and Attention which the Tutor of <HI>Ascanius</HI> shews his Pupil. Thus <HI>Virgil</HI> paints Mankind in every Stage and Station of Life, and in all with equal Propriety: his Judgment never fails him.</P>
<P>I had forgot to recommend two very fine Passages; the Meeting between <HI>Alecto</HI> and <HI>Turnus,</HI> and the Story of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Shield, made by <HI>Vulcan.</HI> Had I
<PB N="98" REF="120"/>
nothing to divert me from this my fa∣vourite Employ of instructing you, my Observations should be more copious and distinct; but still I hope they are what will be of some Use. If I have not tired you, I will employ another Let∣ter on this same Subject, so difficult do I find it to leave this admirable Writer; ever desiring you to retain in your Mind, that it is not in Order to make you a Critic, only to enable you to read these two incomparable Poems, the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Aeneid,</HI> with Pleasure and Profit.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Angel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 23d instant; it gave me more Pleasure than I can express. Your Sentiments of particular Passages in <HI>Homer,</HI> so far as you have read, are just and fine, and I desire you will give me your Thoughts on all the Remainder, as you proceed. <HI>Homer</HI> cer∣tainly strikes us more than <HI>Virgil,</HI> at first. He surpasses almost all Writers in Loftiness, in Strength, in Fire, and in a boundless Fancy. But more of this at Length, when we come to have him before us, and make him our
<PB N="100" REF="122"/>
mutual Topic; though, in Truth, you have prevented a good deal of what I should have had to say on him, and will continue so to do, as you go on. I will now conclude my Observations on the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and that in as few Words as possible.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> makes his Hero not only do hu∣mane Offices to his Friends, his Rela∣tions, and to his Nurse, but even to his Servants. His Care of the Funerals of <HI>Misenus</HI> his Trumpeter, and <HI>Palinurus</HI> his Pilot, are Instances of this.</P>
<P>When he describes a funeral Pomp, a Sacrifice, the Admission of an Ambas∣sador, the Consecration of a Trophy, the Celebration of a Festival, the Solem∣nities
<PB N="101" REF="123"/>
at declaring War, or concluding Peace, or any Ceremonial whatsoever, it is not only most beautifully delivered, but we may be assured, he lets us, at the same time, into the exact Manners and Customs of the <HI>Romans,</HI> on all such Occasions, so that Delight and Instruction go Hand in Hand.</P>
<P>Not only every word in <HI>Virgil</HI> is a Jewel, but they are all so put together, that every Sentence may be said to repre∣sent a String of Jewels set to the best Ad∣vantage, and the whole <HI>Aeneid</HI> is so com∣pact, one Part so connected with another, that they tend to illustrate each other in the most striking Colours, and follow in such natural Order and Process, as renders
<PB N="102" REF="124"/>
the whole Work beautiful, and places it in the most becoming Point of Sight.</P>
<P>It is observable that <HI>Virgil</HI> never uses an idle Word. Although there are some things, the Purpose whereof we do not perceive, at a first reading, yet on nearer observation, before, or by the Time we reach the End of the Poem, we plainly discover it. I'll give you an Instance of this fine Address in <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>He makes his Hero not only the greatest Character in his Work, but also the most beautiful and virtuous. This is the Reverse of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Proceeding, who seems to make <HI>Hector</HI>'s Character the most lovely of his Heroes; (and perhaps both Poets were in the Right, as I shall here∣after
<PB N="103" REF="125"/>
endeavour to make appear, when we come to compare Notes on the Greek) <HI>Virgil</HI> describes <HI>Turnus</HI> fierce and haughty; when he kills <HI>Pallas,</HI> he does it with Pleasure; he insults over him, and dispatches a cruel Message to his Father. He indeed sends back the Body (for this Author seems resolved not to make <HI>Turnus</HI> so savage as <HI>Achilles</HI>) but spoils him of his Armour, and puts it on himself, together with the gorgeous Belt, which <HI>Pallas</HI> wore. Now we should be apt to suppose, at this parti∣cular Crisis, that there was nothing more implied herein, than that it was customary for great Warriors to wear the Arms of Adversaries, whom they had subdued. But we find afterwards
<PB N="104" REF="126"/>
that <HI>Virgil</HI> had a particular Use to make of this Belt, which he had so especially mentioned. <HI>Turnus</HI> puts it on, and wears it in Triumph; whereon the Poet makes a useful Reflection, and, at the same time, gives us a Hint of what will fol∣low. "The Mind of Man," says he, <Q>elated with Prosperity, is incapable of behaving with Moderation, and blind to Futurity. The Time will come when <HI>Turnus</HI> will sorely regret that ever he assaulted <HI>Pallas.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I will break off here, lest my Letter should be too long, and give you one more on this Subject.</P>
<P>The Lines, you have quoted,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"As when the Moon, refulgent Lamp of Night," &amp;c. l. 687 to l. 698.</NOTE> are in my Opinion the most beautiful in the
<PB N="105" REF="127"/>
whole <HI>Iliad.</HI> If you remember, one Night as we were coming through the Park, after I had repeated to you <HI>Milton</HI>'s Description of a fine Evening, I endea∣voured to give you those, but could not recollect them all.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Letter of the 27th came safe to my Hand on the 29th. I really cannot tell you particularly when I shall be in Town; but believe it will be some Time this Month. My comings depends on the Receipt of some Letters from <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="128"/>As you intend to read the <HI>Aeneid</HI> again, there are many things, that I shall pass over, because I would not forestall the Pleasure you are to have, if you read it with due Attention, I shall only finish the Remark I began about <HI>Pallas</HI>'s Belt.</P>
<P>When <HI>Aeneas</HI> vanquishes <HI>Turnus,</HI> at the latter Part of the Poem, <HI>Turnus</HI> sues for his Life. Now it was not pro∣per to grant it; and the Nicety was, how to make <HI>Aeneas,</HI> who was so famous for Humanity, and a merciful Disposition, not comply with the Request, and yet preserve his own Character. Behold this very Belt is made use of, which natu∣rally and critically meets his Eye at the very Instant when his Anger begins to relent and his Heart to melt. He imme∣diately fires, with fresh Resentment, on
<PB N="107" REF="129"/>
recollection of the cruel Insults which <HI>Turnus</HI> was guilty of, when he flew <HI>Pal∣las.</HI> Hence a noble Indignation, Resent∣ment, and even Compassion for the Fate of <HI>Pallas</HI> occasions the Death of <HI>Turnus</HI>; and thus the Poet, by a beautiful Stroke of Fancy, makes that great Event the Re∣sult of Friendship and Pity, which otherwise had been an Act of Cruelty. We learn also, from the Instance before us, this fine Lesson, "That what People are most proud and vain of, is often the Occasion of their Ruin." There is a noble Reflection to this Purpose at the End of the tenth Satire of Juvenal. All that I have further to say about the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> is, to point out to you some charming Comparisons, and then I have done with it. This I shall do in my next
<PB N="108" REF="130"/>
Letter, which I propose writing on Sun∣day.</P>
<P>I would have you, my dear, look in∣to the Lives of the ancient Philosophers; and particularly regard their Observations made on Life; they will be of great Use to you.</P>
<P>You do not tell me what you think of the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucault's</HI> Maxims, and Observations.</P>
<P>I am now going through Ovid's Meta∣morphoses anew, and the more I read, the more I am charmed with it. I won∣der you do not proceed in that Work. No Man surely had ever so easy, so natu∣ral, so charming a Manner of telling a Story. You love Novels. <HI>Ovid</HI> has an

When <HI>Aeneas,</HI> after the Arrow was drawn out with which he was wounded, is returning to the Place of Battle, with the whole Corps de Reserve, while Clouds of Dust arise, and the Earth trembles with the Beating of the Horses Feet, his Ene∣mies, struck with Terror, are nobly com∣pared to Husbandmen, who see a black Storm coming across the Sea, that threa∣tens universal Ruin, destroys the Trees, and lays waste the Fruits of the Earth.

The Poet makes it still more terrible by one peculiar Circumstance, which is a <HI>whisk∣ing</HI> Wind, a certain Fore-runner of such a dreadful Storm, as he there describes.</P>
<P><HI>Aeneas</HI> pursuing <HI>Turnus,</HI> and not being able to overtake him, is aptly likened to a Hound pursuing a Deer; and this is so lively a Representation to one who has seen such a Chace, as nothing can sur∣pass. ☞ Again <HI>Turnus,</HI> in his Engagement with <HI>Aeneas,</HI> when confounded with Fear and the bad Omens he had met with, and persuaded the Gods were against him, fights indeed, but in such a Manner, as one imagines one does in a Dream. How forcibly picturesque! But read it. That exceeds all Description.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="135"/>There is, however, a Comparison in <HI>Milton,</HI> which is far beyond all I ever read in <HI>Virgil, Homer,</HI> or any where. That is, the Comparison of <HI>Michael</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> to two black Clouds, that fill up the dif∣ferent Parts of the Sky, big with Thun∣der, Lightening and Tempest, and at last discharge their whole Artillery at each other.</P>
<P>The last Observation I shall make on <HI>Virgil,</HI> is, that he has been a great Lover of what is called the Belles Lettres. We can perceive that be admired Painting himself, by what he relates of <HI>Aeneas</HI> admiring the Paintings in <HI>Dido</HI>'s Palace before he broke through the Cloud, and by his charming Description of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Shield. You will find too he loved Statuary
<PB N="114" REF="136"/>
Musick, and Architecture; and you may discern the same of <HI>Ovid,</HI> in a hundred Places. We see two Instances of his Skill in the Contest between <HI>Pallas</HI> and <HI>Arachne,</HI> and beside, how nicely he un∣derstood the Art of weaving Arras. I am reading him over, just now. He has so many beautiful Stories, that I wonder you do not take more Delight in him, than you appear to do. You love Novels; and I never read any so beautiful as his, <HI>Pyramus</HI> and <HI>Thisbe; Medea</HI> and <HI>Jason; Scylla</HI> and <HI>Minos; Cephalus</HI> and <HI>Procris; Ceyx</HI> and <HI>Alcyone; Perseus</HI> and <HI>Andromeda</HI>; the Fable of <HI>Niobe; Pallas</HI> and <HI>Arachne</HI>; the <HI>Muses</HI> and the <HI>Pierides; Meleager</HI> and <HI>Atalanta,</HI> and a Hundred more, are Stories the most exquisitely told that are any where to be found, and are withal per∣fect
<PB N="115" REF="137"/>
Images of Nature. You may like∣wise discern through all how the Poet is delighted with whatever is good and virtuous, worthy and laudable; and, on the other Hand, how he detests all kind Vice of and Wickedness, nay even every Degree of Rudeness and Ill-manners.</P>
<P>It is clear to me that <HI>Ovid</HI> was not only one of the greatest Wits, and one of the best of Men, but one of the best-natured, best-humoured, and best-bred Gentlemen in the World. He wrote indeed with a Sort of Carelessness, and his unhappy Banishment hindered him to correct his admirable Poem, the <HI>Meta∣morphoses</HI>; which has ever since continued the great Fund, whence Sculptors, Pain∣ters, and Writers of Operas, and some
<PB N="116" REF="138"/>

<P>I HAVE the Pleasure of yours of the 21st instant; and am exceedingly pleased to find you have executed all my Commissions with so much Address and Prudence.</P>
<P>You need not fear being troublesome to the Lady, your new Acquaintance, if you go at proper Times. Observe the Disposition the Family is in, and whe∣ther Business, or any other Cause, may not make your Visit unseasonable; which you'll easily discover; and in that case, let your Stay be short. Take care too

always to leave a due Distance of Time between your Visits. What I wrote you once before, I will write again, though it becomes almost unnecessary now. Never give yourself Airs, nor shew Af∣fectation, nor endeavour to <HI>shine</HI> as it is called. Talk modestly, within the Com∣pass of your Understanding, and if you don't court Praise, Praise will court you.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon <HI>Homer,</HI> let me observe, that you have omitted to men∣tion the Figure <HI>Hector</HI> makes at the End of the Twelfth Book; where he breaks through the Grecian Entrenchments, <HI>like sudden Night, and with Eyes burning like Fire,</HI> as the Poet expresses it.

<P>I am sorry to tell you that I cannot see you so soon as I expected. It will not suit my Affairs to leave this Place for ten Days yet; but be sure to write me often in that Time; that is, as often as your other Business will allow, and let <HI>Homer</HI> be the Subject of your Letters. I will write you as frequently as I can, and be∣gin upon the same Subject.</P>
<P>I have just now entered upon <HI>Pope</HI>'s Preface and Essay, to see whether some of the Particulars I have remarked are not in his Observations. <HI>Homer</HI> will fur∣nish us Matter enough to write about. I would rather have you send short Let∣ters,

<P>I shall go to-morrow to a Gentleman's House, about twelve miles from this, where I shall stay three Days, and thence set out for London.</P>
<P>My intended Visit is not the Call of Business, but mere Matter of Ceremony, which you know I am not over fond of; yet I think it a kind of Duty to comply with it.

<SALUTE>My dear Life,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WENT to Bed Yesternight, that is to say, this Morning, about two. I was wakened about Five, and in the Coach near half an Hour after Seven. We got to Uxbridge before Twelve, where we took Breakfast; but I had wisely drank
<PB N="131" REF="153"/>
three Dishes of Coffee, and eaten a but∣tered Toast before-hand.</P>
<P>We arrived here before Five. We dined; and now after finishing the en∣closed Letter, I write you this, desiring you not to neglect the Enclosure. My Health is not clever, but I hope to sleep well to-night, and then I shall be right again. To Children, and Persons advan∣ced in Life, Sleep is a Medicine for many Ills; and surely the pleasantest of all Me∣dicines. Did you ever read <HI>Shakespeare</HI>'s Tragedy of <HI>Macbeth?</HI> if not get it, and send me your Opinion of it. I will transcribe his Passage on Sleep, which, for the luxuriant Variety of sweet and no¦ble Images, is scarce to be equalled.</P>
<Q><PB N="132" REF="154"/>
<L>The innocent Sleep,</L>
<L>Sleep that knits up the ravell'd Sleeve of Care,</L>
<L>The Death of each day's Life, sore Labour's Bath,</L>
<L>Balm of hurt Minds, great Nature's second Course,</L>
<L>Chief Nourisher in Life's Feast.</L></Q>
<P>What a Group of beautiful Images are here! Nor has the great Bard assembled them merely to indulge his fine Fancy; no, they are of a Piece with the great Action of the Scene, and answer an im∣portant moral End; for by how much he endears to us the inestimable Blessing of Sleep, by so much he aggravates the atro∣cious Crime of Murder, from the Com∣mission whereof <HI>Macbeth</HI> is but just re∣turned. Observe too the first Epithet which he gives to Sleep, <HI>innocent</HI>; it is very copious. It not only implies that Sleep is innocent in itself, that while we
<PB N="133" REF="155"/>
sleep, we are free from Guilt, but that Sleep most naturally dwells with inno∣cent and undisturbed Minds.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but I shall dream of you to-night for I have been dreaming of you all Day. I shall write you again on Sunday, and include a small Missive to Mr. K—, which you will deliver when you think fit. Give my humble Service to your Mama and Aunt, and believe me to be most truly</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should begin this Letter with <HI>Homer,</HI> and proceed in Form and Order, but I have so many Letters to write this Day,
<PB N="139" REF="161"/>
that I dare not venture on it. I shall only mark out two or three Passages in the Fourth Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which I have just now read, and which I think pecu∣liarly fine.</P>
<P>The first is at Line 492:
<Q><L>As when the fleecy Flocks un-number'd stand</L>
<L>In wealthy Folds, and wait the Milker's Hand,</L>
<L>The hollow Vales incessant Bleating fills,</L>
<L>The Lambs reply from all the neighb'ring Hills.</L></Q></P>
<P>The second is at Line 516:
<Q><L>As Torrents roll, increas'd by num'rous Rills,</L>
<L>With Rage impetuous down their echoing Hills,</L>
<L>Rush to the Vales, and, pour'd along the Plain,</L>
<L>Roar thro' a thousand Channels to the Main;</L>
<L>The distant Shepherd trembling hears the Sound,</L>
<L>So mix both Hosts, and so their Cries rebound.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="162"/>These are two fine Comparisons, and at the same Time, are noble Descriptions. I the rather quote them to you, because you might possibly pass them over, with∣out regarding them so much, as you never saw the Originals, of which these De∣scriptions are a Picture; but if you had seen them, as I have often done (being born and bred up all my younger Days in a very mountainous Country) you would own that nothing can be more natural or beautiful.</P>
<P>To understand the first Comparison rightly, it is necessary to know that when the Lambs arrive at a certain Age, they are weaned, and put in a separate Flock by themselves. The Ewes are put in Folds to be milked. That reci∣procal
<PB N="141" REF="163"/>
Desire which the Ewes and Lambs have to be together, makes them bleat incessantly, and, when within hearing, they regularly answer each other; those Sounds the Hills-echo back, and fill the whole Valleys, or Glens (as we call them in <HI>Scotland)</HI> with a very agreeable Noise, even Musick is scarcely more agreeable; at least, to me.</P>
<P>How exceedingly fine is the Description of Discord, Line 503,
<Q>Small at her Birth and rising every Hour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is very judiciously placed where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Grecians and Trojans, who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>early reconciled, dissent again. The Colouring suits the Nature of Discord, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trife, admirably; which often arises
<PB N="142" REF="164"/>
from very small Beginnings, perhaps from a meer Trifle; and to what a monstrous Height does it sometimes grow! It re∣minds me of what Solomon says,
<Q>The Beginning of Strife is like the letting in of Water;</Q>
for if we will make but a small Passage for Water to enter at, it will itself enlarge it sufficiently. We have this expressive Proverb in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<Q>The Mother of Mischief is no greater than a Midge's Wing,</Q>
that is, a Gnat's Wing—intimating how small a Circumstance, how worthless and inconsiderable, may occasion much Con∣tention and great Mischief.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="165"/>The Moral, on the whole is, <HI>Avoid Strife as much as possible,</HI> and, as the Apostle says excellently,
<Q>Seek Peace with all Men.</Q></P>

The Effects of Patience and long Suffering are well-advised Actions, terminating in the Ac∣complishment of our Wishes and leading to Happiness. <HI>Horace,</HI> who knew Man∣kind as well, perhaps, as any Man, who lived before or since his Time, (except some few whom we meet in the Holy Writings) says, that "He who violent∣ly hastens his Revenge, renders the very End he would attain, ineffectual." The <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey</HI> are two great Examples of the Truth of this. In the former we see the Rage and Resentment of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon</HI> frustrate the very Design, for which they came to <HI>Troy;</HI> to wit, the Destruction of the Town. What Miseries did they not occasion? What loss of gallant Men? And <HI>Achilles,</HI> who
<PB N="146" REF="168"/>
even got the better in the Contest between him and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> paid dear for it in the Loss of his beloved <HI>Patroclus.</HI> What though he had the Satifaction, or rather Triumph, of killing <HI>Hector,</HI> (a much wor∣thier Man than himself) yet that did not remove his Grief and Misery; for, after that, we still find him in the Agonies of Sorrow; so true is it, that even when our blind and mad Desires are granted, we find ourselves as far from Happiness as we were before. Again, what did the Satisfaction of killing <HI>Hector</HI> cost him? In the first Place, we see he was forced to forego the savage Pleasure, he took in abusing the Body of that illu∣strious Chief; in spite of his Teeth, as we say, <HI>Jove</HI> compelled him to forego it. He was even obliged to do honour to the
<PB N="147" REF="169"/>
Corpse. Furthermore we find his own Fate was attached to that of <HI>Hector. Hector</HI> told him, at his Death, <Q>the Gods would not let his Death pass unreven∣ged.</Q> <HI>Apollo</HI> accordingly met <HI>Achilles</HI> at the <HI>Scean</HI> Gate, and revenged it home; and, to his utter Disgrace, made him fall at last by a far less worthy Hand than that of <HI>Hector.</HI></P>
<P>I shall take Notice of this Particular more at length, in some following Let∣ter. All I shall add at present, is, that it is true we have not such Thunder and Lightning, so great an Eclat, such bold Characters, such Force, such Grandeur and Majesty in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> as in the <HI>Iliad;</HI> yet the <HI>Arch-bishop of Cambray</HI> observes, that the Antients, (at least the best Judges and Criticks of Antiquity) do not give

the <HI>Iliad</HI> the Preference. I shall not re∣peat what he says on that Head, but re∣fer you to his own Words; they are in the <HI>Dialogues des Morts.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YEsterday's Post brought me yours of the 9th, in which your Hurry makes you leave out some Words, and misplace others; this I wish you to guard against. It is a Neglect unworthy of you.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="171"/>Before you proceed in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> I must beg you to read <HI>Bossu,</HI> at least some Chap∣ters in the Beginning of his admirable Treatise. They will give you a proper Idea of the Nature and Plan of this, and every other Heroick Poem. There is also a short Discourse on Epick Poetry prefixed to the last English Translation of <HI>Telemaque,</HI> which is well worth your Attention; though I cannot agree with the Writer in preferring <HI>Telemaque</HI> to <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>I do not recommend these Books, in order to make you a nice Critick, but to enable you to read such Works as the <HI>Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid, Paradise Lost</HI> and <HI>Tele∣machus,</HI> with greater Pleasure and Profit. You may add to the List, <HI>Tosso</HI>'s <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="172"/>
which I have just finished (a fine Poem indeed, and admirably translated) and <HI>Ramsay</HI>'s <HI>Travels of Cyrus,</HI> about which we will talk when I come to Town.</P>
<P>There are several other Works, some of which you have, that will be of great Service towards forming a true Idea of those noble Authors, and likewise of all other kinds of Poetry; such as <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry, Roscommon on Translated Verse, Horace, Vida,</HI> and the <HI>Duke of Buck∣kingham</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry, Rapin</HI>'s and <HI>Da∣cier</HI>'s <HI>Discourses on Eloquence and Poetry, Dryden</HI>'s and <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Discourses, Pope</HI>'s <HI>Art of Criticism,</HI> the most excellent <HI>Arch∣bishop of Cambray</HI>'s <HI>Discourse on Eloquence,</HI> and the <HI>Spectators on Milton. Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Letter on Humour</HI> is also most excellent and
<PB N="151" REF="173"/>
judicious, so are <HI>Dr. Trapp</HI>'s <HI>Discourses on Virgil.</HI> These Writings will give you a true Notion of Tragedy, Comedy, Satire, Pastoral, Ode, Elegy, and Song, as well as of Epick Poetry; which last indeed, together with Tragedy and Comedy, are the three great Species of Poetry.</P>
<P>I will now suppose that you have formed, or procured, a right Notion of the Nature of an Heroick Poem, and of the Action; that it must be one great, in∣tire, marvelous, but not incredible Piece; of a just Length, instructive and enter∣taining; I will presume likewise that you have a Notion of the Characters, Man∣ners, Sentiment and Diction, and of the ornamental Aid of Figures, Episodes, Descriptions, and Similes or Comparisons,
<PB N="152" REF="174"/>
by which those Characters and Manners are set off to Advantage.</P>
<P>This being all pre-supposed, let us en∣quire what <HI>Homer</HI> proposes to do in his two matchless Poems, and then examine the End and Tendency of that Proposi∣tion.</P>
<P>We will begin with the <HI>Iliad.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says, that the Subject of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the shortest, that ever was undertaken, name∣ly, the Anger of <HI>Achilles.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> if I am not mistaken, says that <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Proposition or Subject, is far preferable to the former. The one is the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> the other is the Establishment of a noble Empire, the noblest, perhaps, that the World ever saw.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="175"/>Now I cannot agree altogether either with <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Dryden;</HI> for, in the first In∣stance, it is not the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> sim∣ply considered, that <HI>Homer</HI> proposes for the Business of his Poem, but the Delays, Disappointments, and Calamities, which attended the Greeks in Consequence of the Anger and Resentment of <HI>Achilles.</HI> This is the Plan which he lays down, and on which he promises to proceed; and the particular Moral, that naturally arises from it, is the most proper and useful that could be offered to his Coun∣trymen. The Grecians were composed of many little States; it was therefore their Interest to be unanimous, and closely united, when engaged in a common Cause. How apt then was his Moral! He wished them to learn that their Safety
<PB N="154" REF="176"/>
consisted in their Union, and that Dis∣cord and Dissension would be their Ruin; this was in the Course of Time, actually verified. <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI> overthrew and enslaved them; and the Means he pursued to bring it about, was first by sowing Dissension among them, and di∣viding one State from the other. So divided, he found them an easy Con∣quest. The same Thing has happened a thousand Times since, not only in sove∣reign States and Kingdoms, but even in private Families. One of our Saviour's Tenets, is, <Q>A Kingdom divided against itself cannot stand;</Q> and this is the grand Moral, which arises out of the particular Subject of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place, if we consider the Tendency of the Poem, I do not see but
<PB N="155" REF="177"/>
it may be deemed of as great Consequence as that of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> though it may not be so speciously agreeable. The Tendency of the one is to shew by what Means, De∣grees, and worthy Qualities, a mighty Empire was founded: The Tendency of the other, to point out the Misconduct, the Vices, and Follies, by which a great Undertaking was almost ruined (and in∣deed had been entirely so, but for an ex∣traordinary Accident) and the whole Force of <HI>Greece</HI> overpowered. This last is surely as useful a Lesson as the first; and strictly justifiable in <HI>Homer,</HI> in-as-much as he proposed to write another Poem, wherein he was to demonstrate the great and good Effects of Virtue; for such is the Purport of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="178"/>I think it is Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> who says that, beside the grand particular Moral, that arises out of an Epick Poem, or that which the Poet had chiefly in view, there are many others, which con∣tingently result from the Fable. This is certainly true; it appears manifestly in <HI>Homer</HI>; and perhaps it was as much his Intention to shew these, as the great Mo∣ral above-mentioned. In my ensuing Letters I will occasionally mark out some of these, and describe what I conjecture to be the greatuniversal Intention of the Author. At present, I fear I haved tired you, so shall trouble you no more for two or three Days.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE some few Remarks to make in this Letter, on the Sixth Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> but they are very few. <HI>Pope</HI> has given us so many fine Observations, that little is left for any other Pen. You have also contributed to lessen what I might have had to say, by sending some of your own, which I am much pleased with.</P>
<P>The Speech, which <HI>Hector</HI> makes to his Mother, is admirable;
<Q><L>Far hence be Bacchus' Gifts! (the Chief rejoin'd)</L>
<L>Inflaming Wine, pernicious to Mankind,</L>
<L>Unnerves the Limbs, and dulls the noble Mind.</L>

<L>To the pure Skies these horrid Hands to raise,</L>
<L>Or offer Heav'n's great Sire polluted Praise.</L></Q></P>
<P>The four last Lines are peculiarly beau∣tiful, and conform to that Place of Holy Scripture, where <HI>David,</HI> being "A Man of Blood," was not allowed by <HI>God</HI> to build him a Temple.</P>
<P>All that passes between <HI>Hector</HI> and his Wife is beautiful beyond Comparison, especially his last Reply;
<Q><L><HI>Andromache,</HI> my Soul's far better Part,</L>
<L>Why with untimely Sorrows heaves thy Heart?</L>
<L>No hostile Hand can antedate my Doom,</L>
<L>Till Fate condemns me to the silent Tomb.</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="181"/>Flx'd is the Term to all the Race of Earth,</L>

<L>Where Heroes war, the foremost Place I claim,</L>
<L>The first in Danger, as the first in Fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>Throughout the whole Work, <HI>Hector</HI>'s Piety towards God, his conjugal and paternal Affection, his Love to his Coun∣try, his filial Duty, and his Resignation to the Will of Providence, are placed in a most glorious Light.</P>
<P>The following Comparison in the Seventh Book,
<Q><PB N="160" REF="182"/>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxford,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 16, 1742.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY yesterday's Post, I received yours of the 14th, but cannot much com∣mend the Writing. I do not desire you to write me, when you are in so very great a Hurry; rather put it off, till you have more Leisure.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble you with a long Letter of Particulars at present, but give you my Opinion of the <HI>Iliad</HI> in general.</P>
<P>Beside the great Moral thereof, there are many other Things which the Con∣duct of the Poem was meant to set forth.
<PB N="163" REF="185"/>
We are shewn the ill Effects of unlaw∣ful Love, vain Glory, Pride, Injustice, Breach of Faith, Dissimulation, Cowar∣dice, Covetousness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Instance, in <HI>Paris, Agamemnon, Asius, Pandarus, Do∣lon,</HI> and many others. Hence as the <HI>particular</HI> Intent of this wonderful Poem, is to shew the fatal Consequences of Dis∣sension and Anger among Princes, so the main and general Design seems cal∣culated to point out the bad Effects of ungoverned Passions and Appetites in all Mankind; to set forth, that our giving way to them leads into Sin, that one Sin leads into another, and the whole into Misery and Punishment.</P>
<P>The great Moral arising from it, is, (to give it you in the Greek)
<Q><PB N="164" REF="186"/><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
that is to say, "So the Counsel of the Gods was perfected, or fulfilled." This is the very Beginning of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has translated it,
<Q>Such was the sov'reign Will, and such the Deom of <HI>Jove.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But <HI>Homer</HI> is much shorter, more sim∣ple, and sublime; for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> does not only signify <HI>Will,</HI> but <HI>Counsel,</HI> and <HI>wise Deter∣mination</HI>; hereby teaching us that Misery is the Consequence of ill-governed Pas∣sions; and according to the stated Nature of Things, it must be so. How agree∣able is this to the Spirit of the sacred Scriptures, where it is said,</P>
<Q><PB N="165" REF="187"/>The Counsel of the Lord endureth for ever, but the Counsel of the wicked shall be brought to nought.</Q>
<P>I was very well pleased the other Day when I found the above Sentence called, in <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notes, the <HI>grand Moral</HI> of the Poem; for, in Truth, though I had al∣ways thought so, I did not know that any one had said it.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote to you yesterday, and having now a leisure Afternoon, I shall con∣tinue the same Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="188"/><HI>Homer</HI> shews us there is a necessary natural Connection between giving way to our inordinate Appetites and Affec∣tions, and transgressing our Duty to God and Man; and thence a consequential Tendency to Misery and Punishment. It is in this Sense that one of the minor Prophets fays, "Is there Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?" teaching us thereby that no Mischief or Evil befalls an impious City or People, but what happens by the wise Counsel and Will of God.</P>
<P>There are two Ways, whereby the great Author of the <HI>Iliad</HI> shews us the Connection between Misery and Sin, and between Sin and inordinate Affections. The one is, the natural Connection we
<PB N="167" REF="189"/>
have before observed; the other, the immediate Vengeance of God proceed∣ing from his Displeasure. Of these we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> without Number, both in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Holy Writings: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gues of <HI>Aegypt</HI> are such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Paral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el, that one would almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Homer</HI> had copied from <HI>Moses.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Madame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acier</HI> have observed, that the Gradation of Punishments re∣lated by <HI>Moses,</HI> is imitated by the other; and in both, the long Suffering and Goodness of God is remarkable. In the <HI>Iliad,</HI> first the Dogs, then the Fowls of the Air, then the Cattle, lastly, the Peo∣ple themselves were smitten with the Darts of <HI>Apollo.</HI> In the Scripture, the Lice, the Locusts, the Flies, &amp;c. pre∣ceded the cutting off the first-born. But
<PB N="168" REF="190"/>
I need not say more on this Head, only refer to the Passages; and indeed many other Poets, as well as <HI>Homer,</HI> abound with Examples of this Kind.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be pointed out, my dear, is, how admirably the Greek Poet has made inordinate Affections be∣get Offences to God, and Injuries to Man; and how naturally and clearly he has made Miseries and Punishments arise out of the former. But I will not de∣tain you longer now, than to with you Health and Happiness; and that you may improve these Things, not less to your Advantage, than to your Pleasure.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote you on Friday the 17th, and thought I might possibly hear from you on Sunday, but perhaps my Letter did not come Time enough to your Hand.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has observed, that, through the <HI>Iliad, Homer</HI> has, in a Manner, made every thing done by Divine Providence. Some Deity always assists the Hero who gets the better, except <HI>Ajax</HI> alone. When <HI>Hector</HI> breaks through the Grecian Wall, and sets fire to their Ships, <HI>Jupiter</HI> as∣sists him. When he is killed, <HI>Jupiter</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="192"/>
has abandoned him, and <HI>Pallas</HI> assists <HI>Achilles.</HI> In a Word, in all Encoun∣ters, and in all Actions, where any Point is to be gained by Valour, Cou∣rage, or Wisdom, the supreme Power assists; in Defeat and Disappointment, that Power deserts them. How con∣formable still to the holy Writings, where God is said, "To put Wisdom into the Heart, to strengthen it;" and on the contrary, "To make blind, and to harden the Heart."</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has often said, that such and such an Event came about by Chance, by the Vicissitude of Fortune, and by the Instability of human Affairs. Perhaps he meant the same with <HI>Homer,</HI> (since he has often mentioned the Fates, or Decrees
<PB N="171" REF="193"/>
of the Gods in very express Terms) though his Meaning is not so clearly pointed; but <HI>Homer</HI> is peculiarly strict in his Expressions, for he always makes the Will or Counsel of the Supreme to be the Disposer of every thing; by which we may learn what worthy Sentiments he had of the true God, and that all Things must be regulated by his wise Counsel, howsoever they may appear mere Chance to <HI>us,</HI> who, by reason of our human Blindness and Weakness, can neither foresee nor avoid Thousands of Events, that fall out every Day and every Hour.</P>
<P>This, perhaps, you will reckon a Digression, and it is so; but it opens

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOMER's Intention, as I have ob∣served before, is to shew us that inordinate Affections lead to Sin, and Sin to Misery. He gives us a hundred
<PB N="173" REF="195"/>
Instances to prove this, but the chief is, <HI>The Wrath of Achilles</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great Design and Tendency of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is repeatedly set forth and illustrated by Mr. <HI>Pres∣ton</HI>; yet I cannot presume it was through Inadver∣tency to what he had once said; it was certainly his Intention so to do, in order to make a strong and lasting Impression on his Pupil's Mind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Beside the Instances themselves, the beautiful Order and natural Connec∣tion, in which he disposes them, fully illustrate his Proposition; and, from the whole Tenor of his Story, this Conclu∣sion naturally arises, that the Counsel and wise Disposition of God is fulfilled in every thing. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has shewed this in his Notes on many particular Passages throughout the <HI>Iliad</HI>; but if we take a short View of the Fable or Story,
<PB N="174" REF="196"/>
we shall then see it in the clearest Light.</P>
<P>Though the Author begins with the <HI>Wrath of Achilles,</HI> yet, in the Course of his Works, he takes care to shew us the Source of <HI>all</HI> the Miseries which he has painted in his most admirable Poem.</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> was a Youth of royal Blood, beautiful and amorous; he sung and played; he seduced from her Husband the most beautiful Woman in the World, perhaps as amorous as himself. Her Husband, who had hospitably enter∣tained him, resents this Usage : he asks the Assistance of his Friends, and the neigh∣bouring States. They sail to <HI>Troy,</HI> de∣stroy
<PB N="175" REF="197"/>
the Country, and, at last, sit down before the Town. The Daughter to the Priest of <HI>Apollo</HI> was made a Captive. Her Father goes to redeem her. <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> refuses his most just Suit, threatens and ill-treats him. The Priest complains to his God, who sends Plagues first upon the Grecian Cattle, then upon the People. The Causes hereof are en∣quired; the Prophet is afraid of the King, but being assured of Protection from <HI>Achilles,</HI> proclaims aloud the Cause of the Displeasure of Heaven. <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> insults him. Hereupon a Con∣test ensues between <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achil∣les,</HI> wherein they ill-treat each other. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> threatens to take <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Captive, <HI>Briseis,</HI> from him, and actually does it; on which <HI>Achilles</HI> refuses to
<PB N="176" REF="198"/>
fight for the <HI>Grecians.</HI> The <HI>Trojans</HI> ob∣tain many Advantages by this Refusal. A Duel is proposed by <HI>Paris,</HI> and ac∣cepted on the Terms proposed. <HI>Mene∣laus</HI> is treacherously wounded. The <HI>Trojans</HI> refuse to restore <HI>Helen,</HI> or stand to the Terms agreed on; and though <HI>Priam</HI> was certainly of the same Opinion with <HI>Antenor,</HI> that she ought to be given up, yet, through Indulgence to his Son, he subscribes to a Breach of the Agreement. Hereupon Battle on Battle ensues. Both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Trojans</HI> are miserably destroy∣ed; and consequently many Proofs are given of Courage, Wisdom, Piety, Con∣stancy, Patience, Friendship, and Com∣passion, as also of Cowardice, Rashness, Brutality, Vanity, Cruelty, and almost of all Virtues and Vices. The several
<PB N="177" REF="199"/>
Incidents are managed with great Ad∣dress. Honourable Embassies are sent to <HI>Achilles</HI> to return to the Service of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> He is inexorable till <HI>Hector</HI> kills his Friend. This gets the better of his Resolutions; he returns to the Fight, from a Principle of Revenge, and kills <HI>Hector.</HI></P>

so naturally and orderly depending on ano∣ther, that each Part serves to strengthen and illustrate the other; and the whole leads to a Demonstration of the Author's first Proposition, to wit, that the Wrath of <HI>Achilles</HI> occasioned many and grievous Miseries to the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Hence we are taught, that Strife and Dissention, as I have observed before, are the certain Ruin of any common Cause, State, Kingdom, or Family; that inordinate Affections lead to Vice; that Vice increases in its Course, insomuch that one Sin, if I may be allowed the Expression, begets ano∣ther; and consequently, such Persons as give way to their Passions and Lusts, be∣come gradually degenerate, fall from bad to worse, till they are irrecoverably plun∣ged in Guilt and Unhappiness.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="201"/><HI>Homer</HI> shews us also, that the Wrath of God hangs over the Head of the wicked, whether a Nation, King, or private Person. God sends his Judg∣ments upon them, withdraws his Assis∣tance, fights against them, sends judi∣cial Blindness and Hardness of Heart upon them, and assists their Enemies to overthrow them; who, in executing the secret Will of Heaven, are them∣selves, sometimes, guilty of the same Crimes he made them the Instruments to punish, and are, in their Turn, chas∣tized.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, he shews how much good Men, engaged in a righ∣teous Cause, are favoured by Heaven. The Way to obtain this Favour he points
<PB N="180" REF="202"/>
out to be by supplicating, and serving God, and the Return to be made by Thankfulness and Praise.</P>
<P>In my next I shall illustrate all this from the Summary of the Poet's Fable.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxford,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 29, 1742.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Letter written on Christ∣mas-Day, and wrote to you the Day after that Date, but I had sealed mine before yours came to hand, so did not chuse to open it.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="203"/>I told you in my last except one, that <HI>Homer</HI>'s Purpose in his <HI>Iliad</HI> is to shew us that inordinate, ungoverned, unrestrained Passions and Appetites are the Means of leading us into Sin, and consequently in∣to Misery; and that the Order and Con∣nection of the Story helps to set this Po∣sition in the strongest Light. I gave you likewise a short Sketch or Argument of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> Now let me comment a little on it, and we shall thereby not only see <HI>Homer</HI>'s great and accurate Judgment, but discover some very valuable Truths, on which if we will well observe, and im∣prove, happy will it be for him or her who does it.</P>
<P>The Source of all this Mischief, the Destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and of the whole
<PB N="182" REF="204"/>
royal Race of that Kingdom, of infinite Woes and Miseries to their Allies, as well as to the Grecians, was <HI>an unlawful Amour.</HI> The Cause which <HI>Homer</HI> assigns, to wit, <HI>The Wrath of Achilles against Aga∣memnon,</HI> is but an intervening, not the original Cause. <HI>The Seduction of Helen,</HI> and Breach of Hospitality, in carrying her off during her Husband's Absence, that Husband who had entertained the Seducer kindly, who was a Person too of such Distinction, no less than a King, these, I say, were the original Source of all those Woes and Devastations.</P>
<P>Here we cannot but admire the Judg∣ment of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the Excellency of his Fable.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="205"/><HI>Paris</HI> was a King's Son, <HI>Helen</HI> a Queen, two of the handsomest Persons in the known World. <HI>Homer</HI> would teach us herein that handsome Men and Women are subject to much greater Inconvenien∣cies of this kind, than others. Such a Man has great Advantages over the fair Sex, and such Women are more liable to Flattery, and the Danger of having their Morals spoiled by false Suggestions of in∣triguing Men; who never fail, when they meet with a Woman of Virtue, to endea∣vour to reason her out of it, before they can hope for Success. Not half so much Pains is ordinarily taken on Women who are but homely; and we see daily that more fine Women are ruined, than others.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> chose for his Purpose two Per∣sons of such exalted Condition, so highly
<PB N="184" REF="206"/>
bred, alike possessed of some Virtues, and yet made the Crime very black for the following Reasons:</P>
<P>Had they been Persons of mean De∣gree, or abandoned Principles, they would not have made so deep an Impression on our Minds; nor should we have had that Care or Concern, at least, not that Pity for them, which, in the present Case, we feel every now and then, to return upon us.</P>
<P>If <HI>Paris</HI> had been a downright Ruffian, and <HI>Helen</HI> a low dissolute Wretch, they could not have been of any Use to the Poet then, or to us now. What can be learned from two People quite sunk in Debauchery? But these, though bad enough, had yet great Remorses; at least
<PB N="185" REF="207"/>
<HI>Helen</HI>; and <HI>Paris</HI> was not a Ruffian, though he was a Seducer. Now where some good Qualities are mixed with bad, where Virtue and Sin struggle together, and sometimes Honour, sometimes natu∣ral Frailty, gets the better, the Poet can shew Human-kind as it is, and place it in a very instructive Light; otherwise, he cannot.</P>
<P>It was absolutely necessary to make the Crime very provoking, and the Person injured of a very distinguished Character, else the Poet could not, with any due Probability, have brought all <HI>Greece</HI> to∣gether in Arms, to revenge the Injury. Had <HI>Helen</HI> been a Person of mean De∣gree, Kings and Princes would not have leagued together to resent her Husband's
<PB N="186" REF="208"/>
Wrongs; had the Injury been slight, it could not have borne a Quarrel; nor could <HI>Homer</HI> have vindicated his Greeks, whom he is so fond of, nor the Gods themselves, had he built his beautiful Poem on a slight Event. Again, if <HI>Paris</HI> had been of low Extraction, whom could the Greeks fight against? Not <HI>Troy</HI>—for the whole State and their Allies could not have engaged in the Defence of one who was less then a King's Son. In the one Case, <HI>Homer</HI> could not have had his Greeks to fight, in the other, he could nor have had the Trojans to fight against. On the whole, therefore, I hope you will agree with me, that the Bard was most judicious in chusing two Persons of great Distinction, of great Beauty, and guilty of a great Crime, to be the Originals,
<PB N="187" REF="209"/>
whereon to found his excellent moral Poem.</P>

<P>It would be very agreeable to me that you write of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> Your last Let∣ter on <HI>Homer</HI> was of the 14th of <HI>Decem∣ber</HI>; so that Correspondence has been

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PUrsuant to my Promise of yester∣day, I sit down to give you only a short Letter. I now return to <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>I would have you read over my for∣mer Observations on this Subject, when you peruse this Letter. In the tenth Year of the War between the two Na∣tions, we have seen the <HI>Greeks</HI> sit down
<PB N="190" REF="212"/>
before <HI>Troy. Homer</HI>'s Poem begins here, and the Circumstance wherewith he opens it, is the Dissention which happens be∣tween <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achilles.</HI> This fa∣tal Difference had almost ruined the <HI>Greeks.</HI> It arose, you remember, from <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Refusal to accept Ransom for the Priest of <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Daughter, only because he loved her better than his own Wife. He affronts the Priest, abuses and threatens the Augur <HI>Calchas,</HI> calling him a false Interpreter of the Will of Heaven. Hereupon a Quarrel arises be∣tween the King and <HI>Achilles.</HI> They insult and defy each other, till, in the End, <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> takes from him his Captive Briseis.</P>
<P>What we have to remark on this Event is well worth Notice: we see <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="213"/>
fall into the very Crime which he came to revenge. How highly na∣tural! There is nothing more common in ordinary Life, than to stumble into the same Faults and Errors, for which we condemn others. How blind and par∣tial are we to ourselves! How quick-sighted to those around us! Both Men and Women are equally culpable in this Respect. You remember <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Amoret,</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxford,</HI> <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 27, 1742-3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOSE human Frailties I was upon in my last, Partiality to ourselves and Uncharitableness to our Neigh∣bour, are the Causes of more than half the Mischief that happens in the World. Hence it was, that our <HI>Saviour</HI> perpe∣tually preached the Non-Resentment and Forgiveness of Offences. Nothing can so much contribute to the Peace of Man∣kind. To return to <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>We see this inordinate Affection in <HI>Agamemnon</HI> betrayed him into Passion, Rudeness, and Injustice; and these
<PB N="193" REF="215"/>
brought on Misery. What Insults did he not undergo? What stinging Re∣proaches did he not endure? To what Grief, Shame, and Repentance, was he not exposed? In what Calamities did he not involve his Army? How was he constrained to court and sue to <HI>Achilles?</HI> And how were his Supplications reject∣ed, and his Proffers scorned? Here is a natural Connection between his Crime, and the sad Effects of it.</P>
<P>Observe likewise, his Crime was not only punished in its own Consequences, but by the absolute Interposition of Hea∣ven. The Plague is sent upon the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and Burials are heaped on Bu∣rials. This is exactly conformable to what our holy Religion teaches; name∣ly, that one Sin naturally draws on ano∣ther,
<PB N="194" REF="216"/>
and that the End and Wages of Sin, are Death or Misery. Beside this inherent Punishment, God sometimes sends immediate Vengeance. Being es∣sentially merciful, he begins with milder Judgments; but upon Obstinacy and Impenitence he pours forth the Fullness of his Wrath. In <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notes, you see the Conformity of the Procedure in this Plague, to that inflicted on <HI>Pharaoh.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> fell into a Crime of the same Nature with that of <HI>Paris,</HI> but not near so heinous in Degree: the Punishments therefore were only proportionable, <HI>Troy</HI> was ut∣terly destroyed, for the atrocious Crime of that People, and their obstinate Con∣tinuance in it. The <HI>Greeks</HI> suffered se∣verely,
<PB N="195" REF="217"/>
but were not destroyed; for-as-much as their Crime, or Perseverance therein, was not so flagrant.</P>
<P>We gather also from this excellent Poem, that People are oft involved in the Vices and Punishments of their Princes. A wicked King is not only a Plague in himself to his Subjects, but, in his Sins, he calls down Judgments upon them. This is confirmed in the Scriptures, as well as in <HI>Homer.</HI> For in∣stance, in the 2d Book of <HI>Kings,</HI> Chap. xxiv. we read,</P>
<Q><P>Surely at the Commandment of the <HI>Lord</HI> came this upon <HI>Judah,</HI> to remove them out of his Sight, for the Sins of <HI>Manasseh,</HI> according to all that he did.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="218"/>And also for the innocent Blood that he shed, (for he filled <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with innocent Blood) which the <HI>Lord</HI> would not pardon.</P></Q>
<P>The holy Writings teach us that Chil∣dren are punished for the Faults of their Parents. <HI>Homer</HI> shews us the same.</P>
<P>We often see Children unaccountably (as far as Appearance goes) involved in the Faults of their Parents, and suffering on their Account; it appears strange, at first, but on due Reflection, we must al∣low there is nothing more natural, in the common Course of Things, than that the Sins of a Parent should fall heavy on a Child. There is such a Connec∣tion between them, the one is so much a
<PB N="197" REF="219"/>
Part of the other, that this Consequence can hardly be avoided; at least, in many Instances.</P>
<P>The Scriptures teach us, that <HI>God</HI> makes one People the Instrument of his Ven∣geance on another, and again contrary-wise. <Q><HI>Ephraim</HI> shall destroy <HI>Manasseh,</HI> and <HI>Manasseh Ephraim</HI>;</Q> and it is said to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI></P>
<Q>You shall be a Scourge and a Plague to the Heathen that are about you, and they shall be a Scourge to you.</Q>
<P>Nothing can be more natural or more just, with respect to two guilty Nations. <HI>Homer</HI> enforces the same; the <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> are both guilty, but not
<PB N="198" REF="220"/>
equally; they are both punished, but not equally; only in Proportion to the Size and Aggravation of their Crimes, and they were made reciprocally the Means of each other's Punishment. Through the whole Bible, particularly in the Prophets, and more especially in <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> this Doctrine is strongly inculcated.</P>
<P>How amazingly great then is <HI>Homer!</HI> We find a Heathen, through the Strength and Justness of his own Conceptions and Sentiments, agree almost in every Point with "the Word of God." And by the Tenor of the whole, his <HI>grande Morale</HI> is fully evinced; namely,</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>

<P>I'LL let <HI>Homer</HI> stand still a while, and give you a short Description of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>On the Road from <HI>London,</HI> we come first within Sight of the City, at about two Miles Distance, on the Top of a pretty high Hill, called <HI>Shoot-over-Hill.</HI> Here we have a View of the River, with
<PB N="200" REF="222"/>
the plain Country embanking it, and on either Hand a Range of Hills. The Ri∣ver below <HI>Oxford</HI> is called the <HI>Thames,</HI> but at <HI>Oxford</HI> there are two Rivers, that on the West is called the <HI>Isis,</HI> that on East the <HI>Cherwell.</HI> The one comes from the North, the other, to wit, <HI>Isis,</HI> from the North West. They meet at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which stands in the Point between them, on a little rising Ground, surrounded with Rivers and Meadows on the East, West, and South, and with fine Corn Fields on the North. Beyond those Meadows and Rivers are two Tracts of pretty high Hills, covered with Pasture, Corn, and Woods intermixed. When you come within View of the Town from <HI>Shoot-over-Hill,</HI> it strikes you very agreeably with a great Number of public Build∣ings,
<PB N="201" REF="223"/>
such as Churches, Colleges, Schools, the Theatre, Printing-House, Dr. <HI>Rat∣cliffe</HI>'s Library, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Just as you enter <HI>Oxford</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> you cross the <HI>Cherwell</HI> by a Bridge, thence ascend gradually to the Middle of the Town; then you descend as gradually, till you come to the <HI>Isis,</HI> over which you pass by several Bridges. The many Ca∣nals, into which these two Rivers have been cut, have been the Occasion of so many Bridges about <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Their private Buildings are but ordi∣nary; but the great Number of public Buildings, the Squares, Avenues of Trees, the Gardens, Groves, fine Walks, and beautiful Country around, make it a
<PB N="202" REF="224"/>
most delightful Place in Summer. The Streets, for the chief Part, are clean and dry.</P>
<P>This Description, though but faint, is enough to give you a Sort of Taste of the Beauties of <HI>Oxford.</HI> If you wish to be more particularly informed, let me know, and I will do the best I can to satisfy you. I subjoin a Sort of Sketch or Plan of <HI>Oxford</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drawn very correctly, though with his Pen only; a strong Instance of his assiduous Kindness, and probably more valuable to his Pupil, than the most accurate and beautiful Engraving.</NOTE>, as well as I am able to give it. I should have told you that the two Rivers are very unlike each other; the <HI>Cherwell</HI> is deep, flow and muddy, with many Turnings and Wind∣ings, the Banks overgrown, consequently
<PB N="203" REF="225"/>
the Water not easily to be come at in many Places. The <HI>Isis</HI> has a strait Course, runs pretty swift, the Water clear, the Bottom gravelly and firm, and the Banks smooth, clean, and disengaged from Woods or Shrubs.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 1st of this Month on the Day thereafter, and in Return will endeavour to gratify your Curiosity respecting this City.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="226"/>The <HI>University</HI> here is one of the most famous in the World: it is a Place for Education in all the liberal Sciences. For this Purpose, there are no less than seventy Colleges, and five or six Halls, where Instructors in these respective Branches reside; namely, for Divinity, Logic, Physic, Anatomy, Astronomy, Law, Rhetoric, and Languages. Each of these Colleges is a Building by itself, and many of them are very stately. Each is likewise a separate Society by itself, governed by its own Laws and Customs, under its own particular Charter; and the whole, incorporated into one great Body, is called the <HI>University.</HI> Hence they derive great Privileges. The City of <HI>Oxford</HI> is subject to them: they send Members to Parliament; and every Col∣lege
<PB N="205" REF="227"/>
has a particular Founder, as a King, Queen, or other distinguished Personage.</P>
<P>Those who have built and first settled Endowments on Colleges, are called the Founders; those who have left Sums of Money, Lands, or Books, since their Foundation, are stiled Benefactors.</P>
<P>The Halls were originally Buildings belonging to some particular Colleges, though separated from them, and were erected for the Conveniency of lodging Students, when the Colleges were too much crowded; or for the Reception of the Sons of great Men, who did not like to be confined to strict College-Hours. But now Things are altered.
<PB N="206" REF="228"/>
Some of the Halls have been turned into Colleges, and others are wholly inde∣pendent of them.</P>
<P>You desire, perhaps, to know the Dif∣ference between these Buildings.</P>
<P>A College is a Body corporate within themselves, who have a Charter of their own, and can buy and sell, take and en∣joy by Gift or Legacy, in their own Name. The Charter is a Grant from the King.</P>
<P>A Hall has one Head or Chief, in the same Manner as a College, and, like that, is also a Part of the University. It has its own Rules, Orders, and Govern∣ment, but no Charter, consequently is
<PB N="207" REF="229"/>
not a Body Corporate within itself. The Society possess no Lands nor Rents, nor can they take and enjoy, like a College, in their own Name. When any thing is given or bequeathed for their Use, they cannot hold it themselves, but must lodge it in the University for their Use.</P>
<P>There are many good Schools in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> but not an University. The Reason is plain. <HI>London</HI> is a Place of great Hurry and Business, full of Temptations and Avocations. <HI>Oxford</HI> is a retired Place, surrounded with Gardens, Woods, Groves, Hills, Meadows, and Rivers.
<Q>These Scenes the Muses haunt, and Phoebus loves.</Q>
at least so the Poets tell us.</P>

<P>I TOOK Notice to you formerly, that not alone the fine Moral, and the great and important Subject of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem was to be admired, but also his judicious Manner of conducting it, and the Beauty of the whole Contexture of his Fable or Story; whence it is not only pleasant as well as profitable, but from being pleasant, it makes a deeper Impression on our Memories, and we re∣collect it with continual Satisfaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Writer seems admirably to have adopted this agreeable Precept in his own Practice. He catches hold of every Opportunity to throw in that Simplicity and Playfulness, which make Instruction most engaging. A Tribute of this Kind is paid to the Memory of Mr. <HI>Savage,</HI> in an elegant Latin Inscription, in the Cloister of <HI>Westminster Abbey.</HI> The Monument is said to be erected by the Scholar of that Foundation. From this In∣scription I have taken my Motto for this Work, the Turn of it being so immediately adapted to our Tu∣tor's Disposition.

<P><PB N="210" REF="232"/><HI>Homer</HI> has made use of wonderful Stra∣tagems for this Purpose. The Enume∣ration of the Ships, the Names of the Commanders, the geographical Descrip∣tion of the several Countries they came from; the characteristic Distinction of the Leaders; the nice Plot contrived to give us an Idea even of the Make and Shape of their Persons, in bringing <HI>Helen</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="233"/>
to describe them to old <HI>Priam</HI>; the en∣gaging of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Menelaus</HI> first, then of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Hector,</HI> in single Battle; the manifest Advantage he gives to <HI>Me∣nelaus,</HI> and a sort of Advantage to <HI>Ajax,</HI> though not great; the <HI>Trojans</HI> breaking
<PB N="212" REF="234"/>
the Truce, wounding <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and re∣fusing to restore <HI>Helen</HI>—All these serve to vindicate the Greeks, and ascribe Blame to the Trojans.</P>
<P>Observe that, though several of the Grecian Heroes have, now and then, the Advantage over <HI>Hector,</HI> yet he, in his Turn, has the Advantage over every one of them. This is, that the Poet may give the greater Honour to <HI>Achilles,</HI> who is the only Man designed at last to con∣quer <HI>Hector</HI>; and not even then without the Assistance of a Deity, nor till Heaven had abandoned <HI>Hector.</HI> We see too that <HI>Hector,</HI> though the best Man among all the Heroes, either Greek or Trojan, and the Man whom <HI>Jupiter</HI> loves for his Piety and other Virtues, was yet involved
<PB N="213" REF="235"/>
in the common Calamity. He fought, 'tis true, from Love to his Country and Family, but he fought on the wrong Side. How agreeable this to the holy Scripture! There we find national Sins draw down Judgments on such particu∣lar Persons as are, no Matter by what Means, involved therein.</P>
<P>The Case of good old <HI>Priam</HI> seems to be the same with that of good old <HI>Eli.</HI> Though <HI>Priam</HI> approved not of his Son <HI>Paris</HI>'s Crime, yet he was indulgent to him, and did not compel him to do Jus∣tice. Herein his Default was parallel to that of <HI>Eli,</HI> of whom the Lord says to <HI>Samuel,</HI></P>
<Q>I will judge his House for ever, for the Iniquity which he knoweth; be∣cause
<PB N="214" REF="236"/>
his Sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. <BIBL><HI>Sam.</HI> B. I. C. i. Ver. 13.</BIBL></Q>

<P>In Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notes you will read the several Instances of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Judg∣ment in the whole Conduct of his Story, so I need not repeat them. I shall men∣tion only two.</P>
<P>You know it is a Proof of great Judg∣ment in a Poet, to suit every Circum∣stance with Propriety, and to make his Personages act in Character. There is an Instance of the former, when <HI>Homer,</HI> to relieve us from the Fury of a Battle,
<PB N="215" REF="237"/>
brings in his Heroes in a sort of Parley, as that between <HI>Glaucus</HI> and <HI>Diomede,</HI> to which I refer you. Another Instance is in his fit Disposal of Time, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has observed, in that busy Night, which preceded <HI>Hector</HI>'s breaking in upon the Grecian Intrenchments.</P>
<P>To illustrate his Persons acting up to Character, consider the Care and Con∣cern <HI>Nestor</HI> is in, when the Embassy is sent to <HI>Achilles.</HI> You know the Embas∣sadors were <HI>Ulysses, Phoenix,</HI> and <HI>Ajax.</HI> Observe their different Characters, their different Modes of Behaviour; the dif∣ferent Impressions their Speeches made on <HI>Achilles,</HI> and the different Treatment he gave them. Again, observe the dif∣ferent Demeanour of the Grecian He∣roes
<PB N="216" REF="238"/>
on that melancholy Night, when (as the Poet expresses it)
<Q><L><HI>Hector</HI>'s Approach in ev'ry Wind they hear,</L>
<L>And <HI>Hector</HI>'s Fury ev'ry Moment fear.</L></Q></P>
<P>All this is worthy to be remarked with the utmost Care. It is admirably fine, and proves to what a great De∣gree <HI>Homer</HI> has kept up to what the Critics call MORES, the MANNERS.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, my dearest, yours, J. P.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>By way of Postscript to my Let∣ter of this Day, I shall add a few Lines.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="239"/>You see, through the whole <HI>Iliad,</HI> that the Gods always refused the Pray∣ers and Supplications of wicked Men, especially those who continued in their wicked Courses. I need not quote Ex¦amples. We see the same verified in many Passages of the Scripture, and it is confirmed by no less an Author than <HI>Our Saviour.</HI></P>
<Q>Not every one that faith unto me, Lord, Lord, but he that doeth the Will of my Father that is in Hea∣ven.</Q>
<P>The great Moral of the <HI>Iliad</HI> was con∣firmed by the sad Experience of After∣times; and one would almost think that <HI>Homer</HI> had foreseen for <HI>Philip</HI> of
<PB N="218" REF="240"/>
<HI>Macedon,</HI> as well as the Kings of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI> The Romans, after taking Advantage of the Dissensions that arose among the Greeks, or of those they sow∣ed among them, themselves fell a Prey to other Nations at last; and this will certainly happen to be the Case of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> one Time or other, unless they continue to be more wise and virtuous than any States ever were, united in the same Manner as they <HI>are.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my dear, I should be glad you would let me know what you next wish to converse about in this Manner. As I read <HI>Homer</HI> through, I shall hint to you such particular Beauties as I occasionally meet.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="241"/>You do not tell me whether or no you have the little Essay on Epic Poetry before your <HI>Telemaque.</HI> Be sure to write me what you like best in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> as you read it; but don't confine your∣self to that, and read it only when you please. To relish what we read, and profit by it, we should sit down to it with an Inclination.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 10, 1742-3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DARE say you are beginning to be weary of <HI>Homer,</HI> as well as you love him, and of the many Observations we have made, therefore we will drop him after this and my next Letter—at least for some Time, and find another Subject for our epistolary Conversation.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, please to observe that when <HI>Achilles</HI> was reconciled to <HI>Aga∣memnon,</HI> it was not either that his Anger was abated, or that the Love of his Country or his Countrymen got the bet∣ter
<PB N="221" REF="243"/>
of it, but another Piece of Resent∣ment and Desire of Revenge got the bet∣ter of the former, as it was incompati∣ble with the other. And this new Re∣sentment of his was still more furious than the first, and much more unrea∣sonable; for certainly <HI>Hector</HI> was in the right to kill <HI>Patroclus</HI>; and though <HI>Achil∣les</HI> might lament the Death of his Friend, yet there was no Reason for his exer∣cising such a brutal Passion against a fair Enemy.</P>
<P>You will find this very agreeable to the Accounts we have in the Holy Scrip∣tures of the Dispensations of God, who makes every thing, even the Sins and Follies of People, contribute to advance and bring about the Completion of his
<PB N="222" REF="244"/>
sacred Purposes and Will. It still serves too to illustrate his <HI>grande Morale,</HI> which he never loses Sight of,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q></P>
<P>The Jews, when they cried out against our Saviour, <HI>Crucify him, crucify him,</HI> little dreamed that they were forwarding the Salvation of Mankind; nor had <HI>Ju∣das</HI> any such Design when he betrayed him; neither did the High Priest know the grand Import of his own Words, when he said, <Q>It was expedient for one Man to die for the People.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Providence punished the Greeks by the Fierceness of <HI>Achilles</HI>; and by that very Fierceness saved them, when re∣conciled to them. Many are the In∣stances
<PB N="223" REF="245"/>
of this Kind in the sacred Writ∣ings. <HI>David</HI> says,</P>
<Q>The Wrath of Man shall turn to thy Praise, and the Residue thereof thou shalt restrain.</Q>
<P>Another Thing very well worth ob∣serving, and which is still a great Proof and Illustration of the Truth of the above Moral, is this: <HI>Homer</HI> never brings any great Event to bear, any fortunate Act to be performed, or noble Virtue exer∣cised, without the Assistance of a divine Power. When his Heroes fail, it is be∣cause the <HI>Gods</HI> have forsaken them. Do they succeed? It is because the <HI>Gods</HI> are with them. Do they act prudently? The <HI>Gods</HI> inspire them. Do they act foolishly?
<PB N="224" REF="246"/>
The <HI>Gods</HI> blind them. But then it is as observable, that this is the Result of their own Conduct and Principles. There is a Something in their Minds which renders them either dear or de∣testable to the Deities. This is agree∣able to the whole Tenour of the Old Testament, as you may read in an hun∣dred Instances of the Kings of <HI>Israel, Juda, Syria,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lastly, you see the Means of ac∣quiring the Favour of the Supreme was, next to a virtuous Life, bespeaking him by Prayer. This is the Practice of all <HI>Homer</HI>'s great Men; and the Success of their Undertakings was always accom∣panied with Sacrifices of Praise and Thanksgiving. This was understood to
<PB N="225" REF="247"/>
be an indispensable Return of Duty and Gratitude to the Gods. When <HI>Hector</HI> escapes safe from <HI>Diomede,</HI> the latter cries out,
<Q><L>Once more thank <HI>Phoebus</HI> for thy forfeit Breath,</L>
<L>Well by <HI>Apollo</HI> are thy Pray'rs repaid.</L></Q>
And <HI>Jupiter</HI> says, in more Places than one, when speaking in <HI>Hector</HI>'s Favour, <Q>That he had offered many Sacrifices to the Deities.</Q></P>
<P>Thus as these Heroes imputed the Escape of their Enemies to some God, so when they expressed their Hopes of getting the better of them, they are fre∣quently accustomed to say, <Q>If such or such a God assist me.</Q> Herein they conformed to the Phrase in Scripture; <Q>They did not put their Trust in their
<PB N="226" REF="248"/>
own Swords or Bows.</Q> <HI>Virgil</HI> has given us an Instance of an Hero, 'tis true, who did put his Trust in his own Strength. I mean <HI>Mezentius.</HI> <Q>My own right Hand (says he) is my God, and the Dart I am going to throw.</Q> But <HI>Virgil</HI> took Care beforehand to re∣present him a most impious Wretch, and a Tyrant, and makes his End suitable to his bad Character.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, fearing I have suffici∣ently tired you, I will add no more, but that I am</P>

<P>THIS subsequent Letter may more properly be stiled a Postscript to to the foregoing; wherein I forgot to observe to you, that when the Purpose of Heaven was fulfilled by the Resent∣ment of <HI>Achilles</HI> against <HI>Hector,</HI> the for∣mer was checked in his Career before the half of his Resentment was satisfied. He had doomed the Body of <HI>Hector</HI> to be without Burial and funeral Honours; to be left a Prey to Dogs and Vultures; but <HI>Jove</HI> and the other Gods would not permit that. <HI>Hector</HI> was dear to them on Account of his Piety. <HI>Jove</HI> would
<PB N="228" REF="250"/>
have him buried honourably, and <HI>Achil∣les</HI> was obliged to let go his Hold. Herein the Residue of his Wrath was restrained, Heaven having no further Use for it; and herein also is verified another Passage in Scripture,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 12, 1742-3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SAID, in a former Letter, that I had done with <HI>Homer,</HI> but I find I have not.</P>
<P>In order to make his Morals, or the Application of his Doctrine, relish bet∣ter, he has beautifully diversified his Story. He has introduced many Episodes that are very delightful: for Example, that which <HI>Glaucus</HI> tells to <HI>Diomede,</HI> that which <HI>Phoenix</HI> tells to <HI>Achilles,</HI> that which <HI>Nestor</HI> relates, and many others. Ob∣serve too, they are always told in a
<PB N="230" REF="252"/>
proper Place, and always recommend some Virtue, or arraign some Vice.</P>
<P>Many of his Episodes and other Sto∣ries have also the same Tendency with the great Design; that is to say, to shew the ill Effects of Division, Resentment, and obstinate Revenge, particularly that of <HI>Phoenix</HI> to <HI>Achilles</HI>; or to shew us that inordinate Lusts, Affections, or Ap∣petites, lead to Sin and Misery; or to il∣lustrate the <HI>grande Morale,</HI> <Q>That God's Will must be accomplished, and his Counsel must stand.</Q> And by conti∣nually mixing these Stories in his Work, he calls up our Attention to the great Purpose of it.</P>
<P>Besides this great Purpose, he gives us occasional Precepts; Instances of what
<PB N="231" REF="253"/>
is fit, decent, prudent, and of their Con∣traries. He sets before our Eyes many beautiful and useful Things in Nature, as of the Heavens, the Earth, rural Labours, Winter, Summer, Harvest, Rocks, Mountains, Rivers, Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as likewise of artificial Things, name∣ly, of War, Peace, Commerce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But I refer you to what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has said hereon.</P>
<P>The last Thing that I shall desire you to observe, is this. Though the main Design of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is to shew us that Mi∣sery flows from Sin, and Sin from un∣bridled Appetites, yet he therein pre∣sents us with many Instances of Happi∣ness and Success flowing from doing our Duty; and contrary-wise in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="254"/>
though the main Tendency of that Poem be to shew that Happiness slows from a Discharge of our Duty to God and Man, (which is the Consequence of subduing our Passions) yet he mixes, in the Course of his Story, frequent Instances of Mi∣sery arising out of Sin.</P>
<P>To conclude—I fancy to myself that I see <HI>Homer,</HI> like a most renowned old Philosopher, or one of the ancient Pro∣phets, preaching to his Countrymen in this Manner—"Learn, O my Country∣men, that all Unhappiness proceeds from Sin, and Sin proceeds from inordinate Affections. Learn that all Happiness proceeds from Virtue, and Virtue from hearkening to the Dictates of Reason; that in the one Case God will assist you,
<PB N="233" REF="255"/>
in the other, desert you. To obtain his Assistance, you must depend on him; you must ascribe all to him that you do well; you must apply to him by ser∣vent Prayer; and not that alone, but you must leave Vice and embrace Virtue, otherwise God will not hearken to you, though you make many Prayers; and when he blesses and assists you, you must render him the Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving."</P>
<P>"To confirm the first of these my Doc∣trines, I will tell you a Story of the Wrath of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and the Quarrel that happened between him and <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> supreme Leader of the Grecians, at the Siege of Troy; which, besides confirm∣ing my first Doctrine, will plainly prove
<PB N="234" REF="256"/>
that Divisions and Dissensions among People united in a common Cause and Interest, though they may consist of many little independent States and Sovereign∣ties, must probably be the Ruin of them all. This may be the Case of Greece; and you may be swallowed up by some great Prince or other, if Divisions be raised and encouraged among you."</P>
<P>"To prove my second Doctrine, to wit, that bridling your Passions, acting with Patience, Prudence, and Piety, and con∣sequently having God to favour you, will lead you to Success through the greatest Difficulties, I will tell you a Story of the Travels of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> And from both you may derive this important Truth; name∣ly, that every thing whatsoever is or∣dered,
<PB N="235" REF="257"/>
disposed, governed, conducted, and established, by the all-wise, all-pow∣erful, and immutably-certain Will of God, and must be brought to the Period that he has set and determined."</P>
<P>If you have <HI>Creech's Horace</HI> at Hand, read the second Epistle of his first Book of Epistles. It is inscribed to <HI>Lollius.</HI> You will see there in what View he con∣siders these two Poems.</P>

<P><PB N="236" REF="260"/>By the Earnestness wherewith you de∣sire me still to continue my Remarks, it should seem as if you conceived there were no other Author fit to be the Sub∣ject of our epistolary Correspondence. There are many more. Some you have ever at Hand. If you would now and then read the Proverbs of <HI>Solomon, Ec∣clesiastes,</HI> the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and of <HI>Jesus</HI> the Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> with the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Dialogues, Fables, and Lives of the Philosophers, they could not miss to furnish you with Abundance of Reflections, equally proper for Writ∣ing and Conversation; and this they would do without its being necessary that you should comment on every Pas∣sage you read there, or write down every Reflection that presents itself; only such
<PB N="237" REF="261"/>
as most strongly and naturally affect you.</P>
<P>I am pleased with your Observations on many of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Beauties. I have gone through the Author, as I have ex∣amined them. These added to those of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> who has been so copiously excellent, leave very little for me to say; but I will oblige you wherever I can. Nothing has occurred to me till now, with the 9th Book open before me. It would be endless to point out every Pas∣sage I think excellent; I shall only confine myself to such as I fancy will admit some particular Remark or Illustration.</P>
<P>The Complaint against <HI>Jove,</HI> at Line 25, is what Mankind in general is too
<PB N="238" REF="262"/>
guilty of. We lay to the Charge of God what is our own Fault. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> seems to have been exactly in this Predica∣ment, when he says, "Why art thou to me as a Lyar? <HI>&amp;c."</HI></P>
<P>At Verse 47, <HI>Diomede</HI> says to <HI>Aga∣memnon,</HI>
<Q><L>Thou first, and thou alone, in Fields of Fight,</L>
<L>Durst brand my Courage, and defame my Might.</L></Q></P>
<P>He recollects the Reproach cast on him in a former Book, though at that Time he made no Reply to it. Hence we learn <HI>to take Care what we say</HI>; for though we may fancy an Expression for∣got, it may return, and be of bad Conse∣quence, when we least expect it.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="263"/>Verse 225, <HI>Nestor</HI> says,
<Q><L>Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands,</L>
<L>Pray in deep Silence and with purest Hands.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is agreeable to what our Saviour recommends, "When thou prayest, en∣ter into thy Closet, <HI>&amp;c."</HI> and <HI>David</HI> says, "I will wash my Hands in Innocency, and so will I compass thine Altars, O Lord."</P>
<P>In the Beginning of Book the tenth, observe with how much Propriety <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> is employed, then <HI>Menelaus, Dio∣mede, Nestor,</HI> and <HI>Ulysses.</HI> The Wisdom of <HI>Diomede</HI> in chusing <HI>Ulysses</HI> for his Companion, together with the whole Transaction of that Night, point out
<PB N="240" REF="264"/>
the great Use of taking Advice and As∣sistance in an arduous Enterprize.</P>

<P>NEptune's Progress to assist the Greeks, in Book the Thirteenth, is admirably described; and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has shewn us the Affinity between that and a Passage in the sixty-eighth Psalm, but there are many other Places in the holy Writings wherewith it may be compared. It would be endless to enu∣merate them: they will occur to you in your Perusal of that sacred Volume, which is absurdly given as a Task-Book

Be it observed that, by his excellent Instructions, she had then read other Authors, and was more than capable of digesting what he proposed, namely, the <HI>Proverbs, Ecclesiasticus,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>If I may be excused for saying it, I think there are some few Faults in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Translation and Notes in these two Books. In Book xiii. Verse 890,
<Q>His troops unpractis'd in the Fights of Stand,</Q>
is surely a strange Expression.</P>

<Q>Ill-fated Paris, Slave to Womankind, &amp;c.</Q>
is not accompanied with his usual Judg∣ment. <HI>Hector</HI> indeed is bold and impa∣tient—so far he may resemble <HI>Achilles,</HI> but he is neither violent nor unjust. Though he was impetuous, yet we see, through the whole Book, that he was manageable. <HI>Achilles</HI> never was; and had not <HI>Hector</HI> Cause, during the Course of the War, to be highly offended at <HI>Paris?</HI></P>
<P>Book xiv. Verse 290,

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now re-perused the 15th and 16th Books of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> Your own Observations on these are remarkably good; therefore I have very little to say.</P>
<P>In Verse 86. Book xv. the Swiftness of a God Compared to that of the Thought of Man, is inimitably beautiful. Mr.
<PB N="244" REF="268"/>
<HI>Pope</HI> has justly remarked it, but a much inferior Genius could not have over∣looked it.</P>
<P>In Verse 428, we find <HI>Nestor</HI> placing the Confidence of his Prayer in his Piety towards the Gods, which confirms one of <HI>Homer</HI>'s great moral Rules, and which I have touched upon in a former Letter.</P>
<P>Book xvi. Verse 9. This Simile is ex∣tremely striking. Literally rendered from the Greek it would run thus,</P>
<P><Q>No Child that runs after its Mother, and holds her fast by the Robe, and hinders her from proceeding, and looks up in her Face, weeping to make her take it in her Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
<PB N="245" REF="269"/>
You cannot imagine how beautiful it is in the Original.</P>
<P>In Verse 40. <HI>Homer</HI> now makes the same Implication in the Person of <HI>Pa∣troclus,</HI> that he did formerly in the Per∣son of <HI>Phoenix</HI>; namely, the Obstinacy of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and the ill Consequences thereof. This is an Epitome of the whole Scope of the Poem, which, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> remarks, <HI>Homer</HI> every now and then introduces, to fix our Attention to his great Design.</P>
<P>In my preceding Letter I endeavoured to distinguish the Disposition of <HI>Hector</HI> from that of <HI>Achilles.</HI> In Verse 122. we have a strong Instance of the savage Tem∣per of the latter. How unlike the pious <HI>Hector!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="270"/>Verse 837. This Description of <HI>Pa∣troclus,</HI> besides being admirably beauti∣ful, conveys an excellent Moral.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I wrote you last, which was on Friday, I have perused two Books more of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> accompanied with your Observations.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="271"/>The Conflict at Verse 418. Book xvii. about the Body of <HI>Patroclus</HI> is wonder∣fully fine. How naturally is it compared to Fires, that rise and sink by Turns! <HI>Homer</HI> seems fond of the Image him∣self, for he repeats it in Book xviii. In∣deed the whole Struggle, from the Time <HI>Patroclus</HI> was killed, till <HI>Achilles</HI> appear∣ed, is most admirably described.</P>
<P>Book xviii. Verse 7.</P>
<Q><L>Pensive he sate; for all that Fate design'd</L>
<L>Rose in sad Prospect to his boding Mind.</L></Q>
<P>This Picture of <HI>Achilles</HI> is most affect∣ingly fine. But here I will presume to say we may prove Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to have been wrong in his Remark on a former Book, where he avers, "It was Jealousy of his
<PB N="248" REF="272"/>
Honour, that made <HI>Achilles</HI> lay his Com∣mands on <HI>Patroclus</HI> not to fight with <HI>Hector.</HI>" We see here that he im∣mediately imagines him to have been slain; whence it appears more probable, that his warning him to shun <HI>Hector</HI>'s Force, was from Apprehension of the Con∣sequences, not Jealousy of the Motive.</P>
<P>Verse 547. Here are four admirable Lines. The Description of the Shield is admirable throughout. What Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself has said about it, and what he has quoted from others, will, in great Mea∣sure, give you a true Taste of Sculpture and Painting, and deserves to be read often.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now gone through another Book of <HI>Homer,</HI> and made the follow∣ing Remarks.</P>
<P>Book xix. Verse 57. <HI>Achilles</HI> confirms the Observation I formerly made; name∣ly, that it was not the Love of his Country, but a new Resentment, that incited him; and though he preaches here against Resentment and obstinate Fury, yet it is obstinate Fury which here possesses him, and actually makes him preach against it.</P>

<P>AT the Beginning of Book the Twen∣ty-first, the Description of the Flood endeavouring to drown <HI>Achilles</HI> is the Produce of a vast Imagination. The Comparison at Verse 14, is admira∣ble, as is also the Conflagration, and the Effect it had on the Fishes.</P>
<P>But, with Submission, I think all the Scuffle between <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI> Verse 558, very ridiculous.</P>
<P>Verfe 608. This Comparison, and the Note upon it, proves, what I have often
<PB N="253" REF="277"/>
observed, a Conformity between <HI>Homer</HI> and our Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>Book xxii. Verse 221. A further Con∣firmation how dear are pious Men to God.</P>
<P>Verse 278. Read the Notes here. Me∣thinks Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Eustathius</HI> overacts the Defence of <HI>Homer</HI> in this Place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Note here entirely belongs to <HI>Eusta∣thius; Pope</HI> is not actually, only negatively, involv∣ed in it, merely by not having contradicted what was asserted by the other.</NOTE>. They explain the supernatural Assistances which <HI>Achilles</HI> receives, into Allegory; yet af∣firm the like, when shewn to <HI>Hector,</HI> to be real, merely to favour, or rather to ag∣grandize the Valour of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="278"/>Verse 628. Here is surely one of the most beautiful Passages in the whole <HI>Iliad</HI>; and what <HI>Andromache</HI> observes and complains of, we find verified to this Day. It ever has, and will be so.</P>
<P>The Lamentations of <HI>Priam, Hecuba,</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> in this Book, and those of <HI>Hecuba, Helen,</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> in the last, are all different; they arise from dif∣ferent Motives, and each Person utters what immediately belongs to his or her Character and Circumstances; a further Proof how judiciously <HI>Homer</HI> has pre∣served the <HI>Manners</HI> throughout his Poem. It is again evinced in Book xxiii. Verse 41. The Behaviour of <HI>Achilles</HI> in this Place how very consistent! The Appear∣ance of the Ghost of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and all that passes, is extremely fine.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="279"/>In the Detail of Prizes given to the Racers, at the funeral Games, observe the following Lines;
<Q><L>A Woman for the first, in Beauty's Bloom,</L>
<L>Skill'd in the Needle and the lab'ring Loom.</L></Q></P>
<P>Do they not imply, with many other Passages in this Poem, that Women, how beautiful soever, are not prized, without some useful and laudable Qua∣lification?</P>
<P>Verse 369. Here we have a beautiful Picture of an old Man instructing his Son how to win the Prize; and we also discern with what an extensive Genius <HI>Homer</HI> was blessed; for the Rules that <HI>Nes∣tor</HI> gave, being universally useful, are as much in Force now as they were then.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="280"/>The Observation on Line 817, by Madame <HI>Dacier,</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI>'s subjoined Sneer, are, in my Opinion, equally non-sensical.</P>
<P>The Note on Verse 973, beginning at these Words, <Q>But also his Design might be to compliment the Greeks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> is by no Means just, and even contradicts what the Author has often said of <HI>Ajax.</HI></P>
<P>To return to the very first Note on this Book, I cannot concur with Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Opinion in Defence of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Conduct, in carrying on his Work for two Books after the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> He urges that <HI>Homer</HI>'s Undertaking was to de∣scribe the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and as that
<PB N="257" REF="281"/>
Anger did not die with <HI>Hector,</HI> but per∣secuted even his Remains, so the Poet still keeps up to his Subject. But Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> with Deference I speak it, is mistaken; it is not simply the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that is <HI>Homer</HI>'s Subject, but that particular Anger and Resentment which was so destructive to <HI>Greece,</HI> and took Birth from his Dissension with <HI>Aga∣memnon.</HI> This Subject, after the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> is entirely exhausted, and the Revenge then pursued is of a different Nature from the <HI>Wrath</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> un∣dertook to sing; for instead of being destructive, it then becomes advantageous to the Greeks.</P>
<P>In my next I shall give you my Opi∣nion of the Reasons which induced the
<PB N="258" REF="282"/>
Author to protract his Work beyond the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> I thought to have done it here, and so have finished this Sub∣ject of our Letters, but the Assizes are now held in this City. Some Gentle∣men from London engage my Time, and an Acount I have just received of the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Death unnerves my Spirits.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now read the <HI>Iliad</HI> to an End, and have but few Remarks to make on the two last Books.</P>
<P>Book xxiii. Verse 41.</P>
<Q><L>The huge Ox bellowing falls; with feebler Cries</L>
<L>Expires the Goat; the Sheep in Silence dies.</L></Q>
<P>These two Lines are a just Picture of the Nature of the respective Animals. How characteristically affecting is the last to a tender Mind!</P>
<P>Ver. 120. Here are eight fine Lines, and they shew us what was the Creed at that
<PB N="260" REF="284"/>
Time. The last, I think, much exceeds the Original.</P>
<P>These two Notes escaped me when I wrote last, as many other Things do; and indeed Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Excellence in Criticism has left very little in the Power of any succeeding Commentator. I sel∣dom repeat to you what he has said, unless I think it so remarkable as to de∣serve your peculiar Attention.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the twenty-fourth Book, and shall consequently very soon put an End to this Subject, which has entertained us so long.</P>
<P>Verse 5. This Description of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Lamentation is admirable, though the
<PB N="261" REF="285"/>
Lines 17 and 18, are not, in my Judg∣ment, so full and so expressive as in the Original, which is as follows, if literally rendered:</P>
<Q>Sometimes he lay on his Side, some∣times he turned quickly on his Back, then he lay prone on his Face, and then he stood strait up on his Feet.</Q>
<P>Verse 291. This is an exceeding na∣tural Picture of a Person, particularly one in Years, overwhelmed with Grief. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note is most judicious, and well worthy Attention. There is no∣thing more common than for a Parent, in the first Transports of Affliction, to prefer a Child that is dead, to all who remain alive.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="286"/>I have done now with particular Re∣marks; and though we have dwelt on this Subject so long, I yet feel a Desire to communicate my general Sentiments, I mean my Opinion of <HI>Homer</HI>'s continu∣ing his Poem beyond the Reconciliation of <HI>Achilles</HI> with <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> Perhaps I may not express myself so well as to be understood, or my Arguments may ap∣pear too subtle; not solid enough. Be that as it may, I shall expect an impar∣tial Account of your Sense of them, and what your Sentiments really and unre∣servedly are on the same Point.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 6, 1742-3,</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN these my general Sentiments on our great Bard, I must be very frank, and the rather to induce you to be so in your Answer. I profess myself of a dif∣ferent Opinion from Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> concern∣ing the Reasons which induced <HI>Homer</HI> to carry on his Work beyond the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> I am apt to think the true Reason was, that the Poet had many more beautiful Things to say, which he was unwilling should be lost; and truly I am glad they were not. But then the Question is, whether he has done
<PB N="264" REF="288"/>
judiciously in protracting the Work, ra∣ther than to close it with the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> as <HI>Virgil</HI> has finished the <HI>Aeneid</HI> with that of <HI>Turnus.</HI></P>
<P>To form a right Judgment hereon, we should consider the Subjects of the respective Poems; that is, what those two great Poets proposed by them.</P>
<P>The Subject of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is the At∣chievements as well as Sufferings of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> till he brought about a Settle∣ment in a new Kingdom, for himself, his Family, and the People in <HI>Italy.</HI> To the Accomplishment of all this there was no Obstruction but the Rivalship of <HI>Turnus</HI>; consequently, on his Death, all
<PB N="265" REF="289"/>
is compleated. There was no need to carry the Work further; though one <HI>Masshoeus</HI> has added a thirteenth Book, wherein <HI>Aeneas</HI> is married to <HI>Lavinia.</HI> But this is superfluous. The great Obsta∣cle being removed, the Poet leaves us to imagine all the rest. What he had pro∣posed was entirely fulfilled; to wit, all the Sufferings his Hero had to undergo with Seas and Winds, with Men and Gods, and all the cross Accidents he had to wrestle with, and bravely subdue by his Patience or Exploits. But it is not so in the <HI>Iliad.</HI> The Poet there pro∣poses to sing the fatal <HI>Consequences</HI> of the Resentment of <HI>Achilles.</HI> It was therefore very justifiable in him to carry on his Work beyond the Time that Resent∣ment lasted. If it ought to have ended
<PB N="266" REF="290"/>
with that, there was no Need to make him kill <HI>Hector</HI>; for that Event fell with∣out the Period of his Resentment to <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> which is the Ground-work of his Poem. But the Poet certainly designed to shew not only the sad Disasters that befel the <HI>Greeks</HI> through the Re∣sentment of <HI>Achilles,</HI> but to give still a stronger Impression of the bad Effects of Dissension among Chiefs, as well as other Persons, whose Interests are united. He paints the great Change of the Grecian Affairs for the better, on his Reconcilia∣tion with the Leader of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Ships are saved, <HI>Hector</HI> is killed, the Tro∣jans are repulsed, and driven within their Town. What follows, namely, the dragging the Coarse of <HI>Hector</HI> round <HI>Troy,</HI> the Grief and Behaviour of <HI>Achilles</HI> on
<PB N="267" REF="291"/>
the Loss of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> the Institution of the <HI>Games</HI> at his Funeral, all this is in order to compleat the Character of his Hero; to shew us his Virtues as well as his Vices. He makes him an extra∣ordinary Person both Ways; and yet of vast, nay of absolute Importance to the successful Issue of the War. He has probably given him this mixed Charac∣ter, as a Lesson how Princes and Rulers ought to manage Persons of great Impor∣tance, who have strong Qualities, both good and bad; so that they may turn the former to their Advantage, and, by a cautionary Prudence, divert any bad Ef∣fects from the latter.</P>
<P>To point out the Importance of <HI>Achil∣les</HI> still stronger, it was necessary to set
<PB N="268" REF="292"/>
forth that of <HI>Hector.</HI> Though this is done throughout the whole Work, while <HI>Hector</HI> lived, it is not sufficient. The Poet does not stop there. The Circum∣stances of his Death, the Lamentations of his Father, Mother, Wife, Sister, <HI>He∣len,</HI> and the whole People, the Beha∣viour of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and indeed <HI>Achil∣les</HI>'s own Speech, after he had killed him, render him still more important, than all that had been said or described of him before.</P>
<P>Add hereunto the Approbation in which he was held by <HI>Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury,</HI> and almost all the Gods; their Resent∣ment at <HI>Achilles</HI> on his Account; their compelling the Body to be delivered up to honourable Burial, and <HI>Achilles</HI> himself lifting it on the Bier.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="293"/>I am apt to think that Piety, which <HI>Homer</HI> has all along recommended, was the great Lesson he proposed to incul∣cate, by this last Book. The Praises of <HI>Hector</HI> for his Piety occur so thick, and the Concern of the Gods for his Death is so strongly painted, that one would be tempted to believe <HI>Hector</HI> was as much his Hero as <HI>Achilles,</HI> only of another Kind; and though the Poet condemns the Cause he was concerned in, and makes him suffer for it, yet he seems to be more in Love with him, than with his professed Hero. He does ample Justice to his Virtues, and seems to make him, much rather than <HI>Achilles,</HI> a Pattern for Imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="294"/>Remember you are to send me your free Opinion on all I have said. I don't desire you to write very long Letters. Write two or three short ones at dif∣ferent Times, and then put them all under one Cover.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Oxon.</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 17, 1742-3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Nancy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Favour of the 14th, but have not yet laid in Provision for a Letter on the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> I have at last
<PB N="271" REF="295"/>
read the two Plays you desired me, <HI>Sir Fopling Flutter</HI> and <HI>Sir Courtly Nice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Man of Mode,</HI> or <HI>Sir Fopling Flut∣ter,</HI> was first written. The Author was a high-bred Gentleman; his Characters are well drawn; the Dialogue is easy, natural, and genteel; there is a great deal of Wit and good Sense in the Con∣versation among the principal Characters, especially between <HI>Dorimant</HI> and <HI>Loveit,</HI> and between the same Gentleman and <HI>Harriet. Old Bellair</HI> is very entertaining; he is good-natured, pleasant, open, and sincere: in a Word, he is a downright Country Gentleman, of the best Sort.</P>
<P>If I mistake not, the <HI>Spectator,</HI> long ago, censured this Play, as being built
<PB N="272" REF="296"/>
on a wrong Foundation; for, says he, "the End of it is to promote Vice." <HI>Dorimant,</HI> his fine Gentleman, is a Wit, well bred, of excellent Sense, and ex∣tremely engaging, but totally devoid of Faith and Honour. <HI>Harriet,</HI> the fine Lady, is perpetually despising her Mother. The Scene of the Orange-Woman and drunken Shoemaker is too gross, and ought not to have been brought into such polite Company. A Lady of good Qua∣lity, and a fine young Heiress, lodging in an Orange-Woman's House, is, I think, wrong judged; and <HI>Dorimant</HI> af∣firming his Intention of marrying <HI>Harriet</HI> was to repair his Fortune, is, in my Opinion, out of Character; unless that, as a Rake, he thought Shame to own that he was really in Love; but,
<PB N="273" REF="297"/>
surely, even that is driving the Rake too far for <HI>Dorimant.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spectator,</HI> after having remarked some Passages in this Comedy, adds, <Q>This whole celebrated Piece is a per∣fect Contradiction to good Manners, good Sense, and common Honesty. Nothing but being lost to a Sense of Innocence and Virtue can make any one see it, without observing more frequent Occasion to move Sorrow and Indignation, than Mirth and Laughter.</Q> He had great Reason indeed for what he said. The Sufferance of such immoral Pieces perverts the true Intent of the Stage, which was meant to be a Place of instructive Amuse∣ment, not empty Dissipation. That Mr.
<PB N="274" REF="298"/>
<HI>Addison</HI> considered it in this Light, is evident, from the two Pieces he gave to the Theatre, <HI>Cato,</HI> and the <HI>Drummer.</HI> The Growth of licentious Pieces is principally, if not altogether, to be ascribed to the vitiated Taste of an Audience. The vulgar Expression, <Q>If there were no Receivers, there would be no Knaves,</Q> may be here not un∣aptly alluded to: <Q>If there were no En∣couragers of immoral Pieces, none such would be represented.</Q> It can∣not be doubted but the Regulator of a Theatre would rather desire to see it a Seat of Decorum, than of Licentiousness, or that an Actor would be better pleased to utter Sentiments of Truth and Virtue, than those of Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="299"/>The other Play, <HI>Sir Courtly Nice,</HI> seems to be an Imitation of <HI>The Man of Mode,</HI> though a faint one. Notwithstanding there are some good Things in the for∣mer, yet the Characters are not by far so genteel, nor is there so much Wit or good Sense in the Dialogue, as in the latter. <HI>Farewel</HI> is a sort of <HI>Dorimant,</HI> only not vicious. <HI>The Aunt</HI> is a Copy of <HI>Lady Woodvill,</HI> and <HI>Leonora</HI> of <HI>Harriet.</HI> The Contrast between <HI>Hothead</HI> and <HI>Testi∣mony</HI> is diverting, but I cannot think they are naturally brought in. <HI>Sir Courtly Nice</HI> is well drawn, but not so delightful a Fop as <HI>Sir Fopling</HI>; nor do I think his Foppery savours so much of the "Gen∣tleman." I do not know what to make of <HI>Lord Belguard.</HI> I think him in the main a silly Fellow, though perhaps
<PB N="276" REF="300"/>
with some Smattering of good Sense and Breeding. <HI>Hothead</HI>'s Behaviour to him is quite <HI>outrée, Crack</HI>'s Character appears overdone, and the unravelling of the Plot not entirely natural. <HI>Surly</HI> altogether is too gross, though some Part of what he he says is entertaining enough. There are certainly many worse Plays. The Pur∣pose and Tendency of this Piece being rather good than otherwise, gives it, in my Opinion, one material Ascendancy over <HI>The Man of Mode.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps what I have said may engage you to read them over again, and then I shall be glad to have your Opinion of them.</P>

<P>IN the first Book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> we find the Misfortunes that befel the Companions of <HI>Ulysses</HI> sprung from the very Cause, whence those in the <HI>Iliad</HI> arose, namely, an Offence to the Gods: they had committed an Affront to <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have read over the third and fourth Books of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P>The Advice which <HI>Mentor,</HI> or rather <HI>Pallas</HI> in his Shape, gives to <HI>Telemachus,</HI> at the Opening of the third Book, is most admirably prudent and just.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="309"/>Verse 62 and 63, are very poetical and instructive, to all Degrees of Life.</P>
<P>Verse 282. Notwithstanding what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says here about the Force of Destiny, I think no other Defence can be made for <HI>Telemachus,</HI> than his Youth, and that Impatience which naturally arises from a long Endurance of Afflictions. The An∣swer of <HI>Pallas,</HI> which is most admirable, certainly points it out.</P>
<P>Verse 333. What a charming Instance have we here of the Power of good Ad∣vice, when delivered in a pleasing amiable Way! Poetry and Music, united with divine or moral Precepts, conspire to keep the Mind from giving way to Temptation.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="310"/>Verse 429. Besides that this is a very judicious Observation in the Poet, for the Reasons which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> assigns in his Note, it includes an excellent moral Pre∣cept to Mankind.</P>
<P>Verse 496 to 515. What an admirable Picture is given us of <HI>Nestor</HI> and his Fa∣mily!</P>
<P>Book iv. Verse 437. I cannot but think it somewhat indecent in <HI>Telemachus</HI> to stile his Father <HI>the Man</HI>; but perhaps this is the Fault of the Translator. I have not the Original by me at present to determine it.</P>
<P>The Stanza at Line 475, is an In∣stance of what I have often remarked
<PB N="287" REF="311"/>
to be one great Point through the whole Work; and at Verse 635, we see it again.</P>
<P>Book v. I agree with you that no∣thing can be more beautiful than the Grotto of <HI>Calypso,</HI> and the Environs; but Verse 177, I think, is a little ob∣scure; the frequent Repetition of the Word <HI>HE,</HI> without a Distinction, seems to make it so. It runs,
<Q>Go then he may; he must, if HE ordain;</Q>
would it not have been better thus,
<Q>Go then he may; he must, if JOVE ordain;</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps you will say I am cavilling at Words, but I <HI>feel</HI> the Objection strongly. I think too that calling <HI>Ulysses the Man,</HI> Verse 186, is not so well;
<PB N="288" REF="312"/>
would not <HI>the Prince,</HI> or <HI>the Chief,</HI> have done better?
<Q><BIBL>Ver. <HI>294.</HI></BIBL>
Ulysses rob'd him in the Cloack and Vest,</Q>
appears to me not particular enough.
There is something too inconsequential
for the Hero.</P>
<P>Verse. 311. Notwithstanding all that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has said in Defence of <HI>Ulysses</HI> being able to compleat his Boat in four Days Time, from the Description of it, I think it is hardly probable.</P>
<P>The Critics have been very severe on these Words, "the well-fought Wall," Verse 395.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="313"/>You see, my Observations on this Book are rather employed in finding Faults, than discovering Excellencies; and I really think Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has made more Escapes herein, than in any I have read yet.</P>
<P>The Note upon Verse 454. is very fine, and merits particular Notice.</P>
<P>Book VI. is charming throughout. It gives us a delightful Picture of the Good-nature, Hospitality, paternal Af∣fection, and Simplicity of the Manners of the Antients. Verse 247 and 248, perfectly agree wich the holy Psalmist, where He says, "Whoso giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord." Pray re∣turn to Verse 100. and read the Note
<PB N="290" REF="314"/>
on that Line, and the subsequent Note, and consider them carefully. The Man∣ner of <HI>washing</HI> observed in the Former, is usual, at this Day, in many Places of Scotland, especially when they wash what they call great Linen, as Sheets, Table-Cloths, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I thought, my Dear, I should have been able to get through a Book or Two more; for I find what is in the Notes, and what you have observed will cut my Work very short; but your Letter is just come to Hand, which I have read with vast Pleasure; only I think you go too fast through <HI>Rochefa∣cault.</HI> I hope to have another from you soon on that Subject.</P>

<HEAD>The following BOOKS are this Day published for JOHN BELL, near <HI>Exeter Exchange</HI> in the Strand; of which the Literary Reviewers have given the Characters affixed.</HEAD>
<P>1. <HI>Four Volumes</HI> Quarto, <HI>Price</HI> 3l. 13s. 6d. ANECDOTES of PAINTING, From the earliest Accounts of PAINTING in Eng∣land; with the Catalogue of Engravers who have been born and resided in England. By the Hon. Mr. HORACE WALPOLE.</P>
<P>2. A new and neat Edition of The HISTORY of Sir WILLIAM HARRINGTON. Written some Years since, and revised, corrected, and improved, by the late Mr. SAMUEL RICHARDSON, Author of Pamela, Clarissa, Sir Charles Grandison, &amp;c. In Four Volumes. Price 12s.</P>
<P>These interesting Volumes had been published scarce∣ly one Year, during which Period, besides a very ex∣tensive Sale at home, four large Impressions were cir∣culated through Scotland, Ireland, France, and Ger∣many. It has been generally allowed not unworthy a Situation in all Libraries, as a Supplement to Ri∣chardson's excellent Writings; and the Encourage∣ment it has met plainly demonstrates the Approba∣tion wherewith it has been read.</P>
<P>To this new Edition an explanatory Index is added by the Editor, who takes this Means of returning his sincere Thanks to the Public, for the indulgent Re∣ception the Work has been favoured with, and assures them every Care shall be taken within his Ability, to render it still more deserving of their Attention.</P>
<P><PB REF="317"/>3. <HI>Price</HI> 5s. 3d. <HI>in Boards.</HI> FREE THOUGHTS ON SEDUCTION, ADULTERY, and DIVORCE; With Reflections on the Gallantry of Princecs, parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ularly those of the Blood-royal of England.</P>
<Q>In this performance, there are many pertinent and acute Observations. It is intended to repress the licentiousness of the Times; and the correc∣tion it applies t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the low Vices of one of the highest Personages in the Kingdom, discovers the independent Spirit of the Author. The Animad∣versions, which our Civilian makes on the Charge of a certain Judge to the Jury, in the Cause be∣tween Lord Grosvenor and the Duke of Cumber∣land, have likewise the merit of being free and spirited; and we are sorry to observe, that they seem to rest on too solid a Foundation. <BIBL>MONTHLY REVIEW.</BIBL></Q>
<P>4. <HI>Price</HI> 2s. REMARKS on the ENGLISH LANGUAGE; Being a Detection of many improper Expressions used in Conversation, and of many others to be found in Authors. By R. BAKER.</P>
<Q>Mr. Baker, the Author of these Remarks, has pointed out a great Number of improper Expres∣sions, which we frequently hear in Conversation, or meet with in Books; and has subjoined many useful Observations. <BIBL>CRITICAL REVIEW.</BIBL></Q>
<P><PB REF="318"/>5. <HI>Price</HI> 1s. THE GENTLEMAN's POCKET FARRIER, Shewing how to use your Horse on a Journey. And what Remedies are proper for common Accidents that may befal him on the Road.</P>
<P>This little Tract has been in great Estimation for these Fifty Years past▪ and has gone thro' many Edi∣tions in Ireland. The Remedies it prescribes are simple, and easily obtained, and never fail of a Cure, where the Disorder is curable; and no Man who va∣lues his Horse, should presume to travel without it.</P>
<P>ADVERTISEMENT.</P>
<P>It may not be unnecessary to acquaint the Reader, that these Prescriptions have not been hastily jumbled together, but are experimentally efficacious. A great many Books have been written on Farriery, of which <HI>Gibson</HI>'s is undoubtedly the best, but his Rules are too tedious for the Pocket. Such a Book therefore as this, is necessary on a journey, in order to refer to, as Occasion requires, and it contains as much as is known by any of our common Farriers.</P>
<P>As small as this Tract may appear, it will be found to inform Gentlemen, First, What Methods are best to be used, if their Horses fall lame. Secondly, What Medicines are proper to give them when sick. Third∣ly, How to direct the Operations, and escape the Im∣positions of ignorant Men. In short, by the Help of this Treatise, Gentlemen will be able to prevent a Groom or Farrier from injuring their Horses, by im∣proper Applications, and mistaking one Distemper for another.</P>
<P>The Receipts are few, naked and cheap: the Poul∣tice but one, and contrived on purpose to prevent
<PB REF="319"/>
Trouble, and save Time and Charges, by pointing out the best Remedies at first, such as are easiest to be got, and such as make the speediest Cures; and the Reader may be assured they have been experimental∣ly confirmed by a Practice of thirty Years. The Book is drawn up in a Manner calculated for a Gen∣tleman's Pocket, supposing him upon a Journey; and no Man, who values his Horse should travel without it.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Price</HI> 1s. TEN MINUTES ADVICE TO EVERY GENTLEMAN going to purchase a HORSE Out of a Dealer, Jockey, or Groom's Stable.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Two Volumes. Price</HI> 12s. The TREASURY: OR, Repository of Politics and Literature, For 1770.</P>

<P>Illustrated by elegant Engravings, representing all the different <HI>Attitudes,</HI> on which the <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> of the <HI>Art</HI> depend; painted from Life, and ex∣ecuted in a most elegant and masterly Manner.</P>
<P>By Mr. OLIVIER, Educated at the Royal Academy at Paris, and Pro∣fessor of Fencing, in St. Dunstan's Court, Fleet-Street.</P>
<Q>The Author of this Work humbly presumes, that he has offered many considerable Improve∣ments in the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Fencing,</HI> having founded his Principles on Nature, and confuted many false Notions hitherto adopted by the most eminent Masters; he has rendered the Play simple, and made it easy and plain, even to those who were be∣fore unacquainted with the Art. After bringing his Scholar as far as the Assault, and having de∣monstrated to him all the Thrusts and various Pa∣rades, he lays down Rules for Defence in all Sorts of <HI>Sword-Play.</HI></Q>
<P>The Monthly Reviewers for December last, ex∣press themselves in the following Terms: <Q>For aught we dare say to the contrary, Mr. <HI>Olivier</HI>'s Book is a very good Book, and may help to teach, as much as Books can teach, the noble <HI>Science of Defence,</HI> or as our Author terms it <HI>Sword Play</HI>; and it is made more particularly useful by the va∣rious Attitudes and Positions, which seem to be here accurately and elegantly delineated.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="323"/>13. <HI>Price</HI> 1l. 5s. BELL's COMMON PLACE BOOK. Formed generally upon the Principles recommended and practised by Mr. LOCKE.</P>
<P>This Work is elegantly executed from Copper Plates on Superfine Writing Demy Paper, and may be had of all the Booksellers in England, by enqui∣ring for Bell's Library Common-Place Book, formed upon Mr. Locke's Principles.</P>
<P>This Book is generally bound in Vellum, con∣taining 5 Quires of the very best Demy Paper pro∣perly prepared, for 1l. 5s.</P>
<P>Ditto if bound in Parchment, 1l. and so in pro∣portion for any Quantity of Paper the Book may con∣tain, deducting or adding two Shillings for every Quire that may be increased or decreased, and bound as above.</P>
<Q>Mr. Locke hath confined his elucidation to the advantages arising from reading; in selecting re∣markable passages from Books; but this is not the only Purpose to which the Common-Place Book may be successfully applied. It is not solely for the <HI>Divine,</HI> the <HI>Lawye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the <HI>Poet, Philoso∣pher,</HI> or <HI>Historian,</HI> that this Publication is calcula∣ted: by these its uses are experimentally known and universally admitted. It is for the use and emolument of the <HI>Man of Business</HI> as well as of <HI>Let∣ters</HI>; for <HI>Men of Fashion</HI> and <HI>Fortune</HI> as well as of <HI>Study</HI>; for the <HI>Traveller,</HI> the <HI>Trader,</HI> and in short for all those who would form a System of useful and agreeable Knowledge, in a manner peculiar to themselves, while they are following their ac∣customed Pursuits, either of Profit or Pleasure</Q>
<P><PB REF="324"/>14. <HI>Four Volumes, Price</HI> 12s. The PHOENIX, Or, the HISTORY of POLYARCHUS and ARGENIS. Translated from the Latin, by a Lady.</P>
<Q>The Public is here presented with a new Tran∣slation of that fine old Romance BARCLAY's AR∣GENIS. The Original has been well known to the Learned these 150 Years; and for the Accomoda∣tion of the mere English Readers, two Versions of it, in our Language, were given in the Course of the last Century; but the Style of these is grown too obsolete for the present Age.</Q>
<Q>The Editor as she chuses to style herself, rather than Translator, has prefixed to the Work, a very judicious Account of the Author's Design, and of the Merit of his Performance: which is, as she well observes, A Romance, an Allegory, and a System of Politics, Considered as an Investigation of the various forms of Government, and of the most proper remedies for the political Distempers of a State, it will certainly be thought a Work of great Merit, if we make due allowance for the time in which it was written. But if regarded only as a Work of moral Entertainment, it will be allowed to stand in the foremost Rank of the old Romances, sacred to Chivalry and Virtue. In Brief, to use the Words of the ingenious Edi∣tor,—Barclay's Argenis affords such Variety of Entertainment, that every kind of Reader may find in it something suitable to his own Taste and Disposition: the Statesman, the Philosopher, the Soldier, the Lover, the Citizen, the Friend of
<PB REF="325"/>
Mankind, each may gratify his favourite Propen∣sity; while the Reader who comes for Amuse∣ment only, will not go away disappointed. <BIBL>MONTHLY REVIEW.</BIBL></Q>

<P>By RICHARD WESTON, Esq.</P>
<Q><P>Botany is indeed a Study of such general Im∣portance to Mankind, that it would be no easy Task to draw a Lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that could limit the Bounds of its Utility. The very sensible author of the Per∣formance now before us hath enumerated some Par∣ticulars of this kind; but to specify <HI>all</HI> would be a vain Attempt. What he has observed, however, in his Introduction is just and pertinent.</P>
<P>An universal Catalogue of vegetable Produc∣tions is a Work of so extensive a Nature, that, to render it useful, it ought to be executed with as much Brevity as possible; and a proper Attention to this Circumstance is a principal Qualification of that before us, which appears to contain a larger Variety of the various Species of Plants and Shrubs than other Performances of the kind. The Au∣thor has restricted himself to the most characteri∣stic Descriptions of each Vegetable, without swel∣ling his Work with a multiplicity of synonymous Names. The English ones, however, are annex∣ed to the Description of every Species, which is another considerable Circumstance in favour of this Work.</P> <BIBL>CRITICAL REVIEW.</BIBL></Q>

<Q>The Original of this Treatise has already been translated into a several Foreign Languages, it is here accurately rendered into English, and has de∣servedly met with Approbation. It contains an in∣genious theoretical Account of the Principles of Agriculture deduced from a rational Philosophy; a Subject of Enquiry which may be considered as of the same Importance to an accomplished Far∣mer, as the Knowledge of the Animal Oecono∣my is to a skilful Physician. For though it is chiefly by practical Observations that both are to cultivate their Art, yet a competent Acquaintance with the abstract Elements of Science may prove the means of suggesting useful Expedients, and often facilitate the Road to Practice. <BIBL>MONTLY REVIEW.</BIBL></Q>

<P>Expressly designed to remove that general Complaint of not effectually instructing Youth, while at School, in what may be of Importance in their future Sta∣tions, and enlarging their narrow Conceptions and scanty Views of Nature. The Various Subjects are so digested and expressed, as to assist the Master, and to ground, forward, and encourage the Scholar, and to make him of immediate Use when he is put to the Test.</P>

As these Opinions will be ranged under each other, Gentlemen will thus be better able to judge of the Merit of any Piece, than by a sight of a few ill-chosen Extracts, selected by one prejudiced or incom∣petent Reviewer. Besides, as the Authors of this Work do not intend to confine themselves to a cer∣tain Number of Pages, no Publication of the preced∣ing Month will be omitted; an Advantage the Pu∣blic has not hitherto experienced, as Books have not been reviewed till some Months after they have been out.</P>
<P>To render this Work further Useful as well to the Trade as to every Man of Reading, Eight Pages of Letter-Press will be regularly added, by way of Ap∣pendix, that may be Bound up separately; giving a short Account of every Volume that has hitherto been published, the various Editions through which it has gone, the Improvements that have been made, the Sizes of those Editions, the Prices, the Authors Names, as far as they are known, the Years in which they were published, and the Names of the Publishers, and whether they are in Print or out of Print; a Work whose universal Utility must be self-evident.

<Q>This is a very useful Publication, particularly at the present Period, when the Nature of our Constitution is so much the Subject of Animad∣version. The Author, together with the Origi∣nal Charter, has given an English Translation for the Benefit of his unlearned Readers, and a cir∣cumstantial Account of the manner in which this sacred Palladium of English Liberty was originally obtained from King John. He compleats the Whole, with an Essay on Parliaments from their Origin in England, and their half-yearly Exi∣stence, to their Septennial Duration, and displays no less an extensive Fund of Knowledge, than a laudable Exactness in the course of his Relation.</Q>
