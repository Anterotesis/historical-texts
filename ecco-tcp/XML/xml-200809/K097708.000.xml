<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Declare I hardly know how to say what justice to myself obliges me to say.—The public hears daily of so many unlucky Poets, who become publishers from the same fate that ranges me in their class, that I am apprehensive the truth, when told, will not serve me as an apology, but the effect of constraint be reputed the wish of presumption.</P>
<P>The course of my studies first gave me a taste for Poetry, and the sweetness of the art inspired me with an inclination to improve it.—The few who saw my verses
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>
said they liked them, and would some∣times ask for a copy of what they had seen.—The first pleasure I know is to please; and indeed I thought complying with their requests an easy return for the obligation of their praise.—They had co∣pies, and in their high opinion of me gave copies to others, who soon circulated some of my pieces, as particular favours to particular friends, through half a do∣zen editions, of which three or four were generally very incorrect.</P>
<P>To prevent this evil from spreading, I have here collected in one small book those verses of which I have ever given
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>
copies, as far as remembrance and pos∣session have permitted me.</P>
<P>All parents have a partiality to their own child—so every Writer has a par∣tiality to the productions of his own brain, that would rather they were seen in a perfect than an imperfect situation— and when a man's writings must unavoid∣ably be delivered into the hands of the public, a decent respect for his own cha∣racter, and good manners to his fellow∣creatures will oblige him to endeavour, as much as possiible, that they may not ex∣cite a contempt for himself, nor be en∣tirely useless and disgusting to his readers.</P>

<L>Drop roses to crown the new May.</L>
<L>Each many-plum'd songster that lives in yon grove</L>
<L>Gives voice to his green-kirtled spray,</L>
<L>And when he pours forth, the soft tale of his love,</L>
<L>Concludes with a sonnet to May.</L>
<L>The brooks that sweet vi'lets and thyme flow among</L>

<HEAD>SALLY OF THE MEAD.</HEAD>
<L>ONE morn when nymphs and swains were gay</L>
<L>And danc'd upon the green,</L>

<L>My <HI>Sally</HI> did each nymph surpass</L>

<L>And I the happiest swain—</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="15"/>To please her was my sole employ,</L>
<L>To her I tun'd my reed,</L>
<L>And, morn and eve, my only joy</L>
<L>Was <HI>Sally</HI> of the Mead.</L>
<L>While yet the morn was clad in grey</L>
<L>I rose to court her love,</L>
<L>Thro' flow'ry fields I took my way</L>
<L>And then her garland wove—</L>
<L>Tho' Rose and Lily both were there</L>
<L>To deck her charming head,</L>
<L>That was less sweet, and this less fair</L>
<L>Than <HI>Sally</HI> of the Mead.</L>
<L>Now she no more shall glad my eyes,</L>
<L>No more my song inspire,</L>
<L>From me the faithless fair one flies</L>
<L>To bless the richer 'Squire—</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="16"/>Yet may her heart know nought but joy,</L>

<L>Lest she might see the <HI>Grecian</HI> Heroes die—</L>
<L>In vain—<HI>Patroclus</HI> rises to her fight,</L>
<L>Dress'd in the reddest horrors of the fight:</L>
<L>Link'd with his friend the great <HI>Achilles</HI> rose,</L>
<L>The tow'r of <HI>Greece,</HI> and terror of her foes:</L>
<L>Stern <HI>Ajax</HI> frown'd upon the gory field,</L>
<L>Longing in death to grasp <HI>Pelides</HI>' shield—</L>
<L>Vainly she strives to put them from her mind,</L>
<L>Her guilt hears groans in ev'ry whisp'ring wind;</L>
<L>See plated <HI>Mars,</HI> high on his crimson car</L>
<L>Laugh 'midst the spreading tumult of the war;</L>
<L>Now sees the <HI>Greeks</HI> and now the <HI>Trojans</HI> fly,</L>
<L>And hears one death-fraught thunder rend the sky.—</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="34"/>She heard—and struck with horror at the scene.</L>
<L>On earth's cold bosom sunk the hapless Queen.</L>
<L>In duteous haste her virgin's round her press,</L>
<L>Heave sigh for sigh, and grieve for her distress;</L>
<L>Anxious each balm to sooth her woes they seek,</L>
<L>And bid its native roses tinge her cheek.</L>
<L>Fruitless their care—In tears they raise her head,</L>
<L>Where Lilies wept their sister Roses dead.</L>
<L>Hark!—the kind streamlet from the neighb'ring trees</L>
<L>In gentle murmurs chides the noisy breeze—</L>
<L>The noisy breeze the sweet reproof obey'd,</L>
<L>Beheld the Fair, and dy'd along the glade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold her, thou, whose passions long to rove</L>
<L>Careless of honour and connubial love,</L>
<L>And learn that, though enamour'd of her charms</L>
<L>Her doating Lord had ta'en her to his arms</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="35"/>Again, restor'd her to his bed and throne,</L>
<L>And to the world acknowledg'd her his own—</L>
<L>Yet not his pardon, nor his throne combin'd</L>
<L>Cou'd ease the pangs that agoniz'd her mind.</L>

<L>WHAT time the weak-ey'd Owl, on twilight wing</L>
<L>Slow borne, her vesper scream'd to Eve; and rouz'd</L>
<L>The lazy wing of Bat</L>
<L>With Beetle's sullen hum,</L>
<L>Friendship, and she, the maid of pensive mien,</L>
<L>Pale Melancholy point my sorrowing steps</L>
<L>To meditate the dead</L>
<L>And give my Friend a tear.</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="39"/>Here let me panse—and pay that tear I owe:</L>
<L>Silent it trickles down my cheek, and drops</L>
<L>Upon the recent sod</L>
<L>That lightly clasps his heart.</L>
<L>But ah! how vain—Nor flatt'ry's pow'r, nor wealth's,</L>
<L>Nor friendship's tear, nor widow'd ANNA'S VOICE,</L>
<L>Sweet as the harps of Heav'n,</L>
<L>Can move the tyrant Death.</L>
<L>Hence ye impure!—for hark—around his grave</L>
<L>The Sisters chaste, the Sisters whom he lov'd,</L>
<L>In nine-fold cadence</L>
<L>Chaunt immortal harmony.</L>
<L>'Tis done—'tis done —The well-earn'd laurel spreads</L>
<L>Its verdant foliage o'er his honour'd clay:</L>

<HEAD>THE CIRCASSIAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Miss—.</HEAD>
<L>JOVE <HI>lately took it in his head</HI></L>
<L>To give the Gods a masquerade,</L>
<L>And sent his footman <HI>Hermes</HI> out</L>
<L>With Cards to ask them to the rout.</L>
<L><HI>Iris,</HI> a milliner of taste,</L>
<L>Hand-bills sent forth thro' Heav'n in haste,</L>
<L>To tell the Goddesses she'd laid in</L>
<L>Fresh goods against the masquerading.</L>
<L>The Ladies all were in a pother,</L>
<L>And hoping each to outvie t'other</L>
<L>Bade her make up their silks and laces—</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> employ'd the Sister Graces:</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="42"/>Who all agreed Love's Queen should dress</L>
<L>As a CIRCASSIAN Shepherdess—</L>
<L>The Graces always fancy well—</L>
<L>Quick to their work the Sisters fell,</L>
<L>Finish'd it in a day or two,</L>
<L>Try'd it on <HI>Venus,</HI> and withdrew......</L>
<L>Who beg'd them first with earnest pray'r</L>
<L>To come next day and dress her hair:</L>
<L>Then in her kirtle tripp'd about,</L>
<L>And soon with this or that fell out;</L>
<L>Till, vex'd to death, young <HI>Cupid</HI> cries</L>
<L>"You Ladies are such oddities!—</L>
<L>"I'm sure, Mama, you quite mistake it,</L>
<L>"It fits as neat as hands can make it,</L>
<L>"There's not a single thread amiss"—</L>
<L>She smil'd—and gave the Boy a kiss;</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="43"/>When bolder grown, by <HI>Slyx</HI> he swore</L>
<L>"She ne'er look'd half so well before."—</L>
<L>To bed she went—thought all was right—</L>
<L>But cou'd n't sleep a wink that night.</L>
<L>Next ev'ning came the Graces three,</L>
<L>And <HI>Venus</HI> had 'em in to tea,</L>
<L>(In great-ones nothing shews so well</L>
<L>As 'haviour kind and affable.)</L>
<L>Well—after pitying the Moon</L>
<L>For tripping with <HI>Endymion;</HI></L>
<L>And calling royal <HI>Juno</HI> scold,</L>
<L>And twenty harmless tales o'ertold—</L>
<L>Says <HI>Venus</HI> looking at her watch,</L>
<L>"Ladies, egad we must dispatch,</L>
<L>"For see—it's almost nine o'clock—</L>
<L>"Euphrosyne, <HI>come smooth this lock</HI>—</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="44"/>"Pasithea <HI>reach my dressing gown,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Thalia</HI> take my toupée down,</L>
<L>"And let its ringlets kiss my head</L>

<L>"In smiles I woke to life divine—</L>
<L>"And here and there a rose entwine</L>
<L>"Adown that braid"—Says Miss," I doubt it</L>
<L>"Won't look so well as 'twould without it,</L>
<L>"These threads of gold"—"I will have one,</L>
<L>"Miss Grace, you know it's quite the Ton."</L>
<L>(So it is possible we see</L>
<L>That Ton and Grace may disagree)</L>
<L>Her locks ethereal now were drest......</L>
<L>"Come, bring me my Circassian vest."</L>
<L>"Where is it, Ma'am?—"I'th' middle drawer"—</L>
<L>Pusithea went—her Sisters saw her</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="45"/>Turn pale—she cries, "we're all undone"—</L>
<L>"How so?"—"Lord, Ma'am, the dress is gone."—</L>
<L>The Graces sobbings can't be painted......</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Venus</HI> only sigh'd—and fainted.</L>
<L>"Here, reach the Hartshorn Drops," says one—</L>
<L>"Fresh water," t'other—t'other "run</L>
<L>"For <HI>Esculapius"</HI>—"Greater need</L>
<L>"Of Doctor <HI>Phaebus"</HI>—"He dont bleed,</L>
<L>"Alas!" cries one—"and in this case</L>
<L>"She should be bled"—Ay"—"Cut her lace."—</L>
<L>Nothing was done of all they said,</L>
<L>For each commanded, none obey'd.—</L>
<L>Here <HI>Cupid</HI> with his play-mate came.</L>
<L>Soft <HI>Ganymede,</HI> to see the Dame.</L>
<L>For <HI>Venus,</HI> knowing not a chair</L>
<L>That night in Heav'n wou'd be to spare,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="46"/>Nor coach for love or coin be had,</L>
<L>Very politely told the Lad</L>
<L>That he should be her 'Squire, and ride</L>
<L>That night with <HI>Cupid</HI> at her side</L>
<L>In her own chariot, drawn by Doves,</L>
<L>And lackied by a thousand Loves—</L>
<L>Ent'ring her room, the Fair they found</L>
<L>Rising recover'd from the ground.</L>
<L>Arch <HI>Cupid,</HI> looking earnest at her,</L>
<L>Climb'd on her knee, and "what's the matter,</L>
<L>"Mama?" says he—"My pretty Boy,</L>
<L>"My dress, my pride, my only joy</L>
<L>"Is gone, is gone."—"Mama, what dress?"—</L>
