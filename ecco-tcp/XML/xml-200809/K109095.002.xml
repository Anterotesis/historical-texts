<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EFORE Christianity appear∣ed in the World, there reign∣ed in <HI>Bohemia</HI> a King, named <HI>Pandosto,</HI> who was married to a Princess of exquisite Beauty and consummate Virtue, cal∣led <HI>Bellaria.</HI> The Harmony that subsisted between this royal Couple gave the greatest Satisfaction to all their Subjects, whose Hap∣piness was greatly increased by the Felicity of their Sovereigns.</P>
<P>At the End of the first Year of their Mar∣riage <HI>Bellaria</HI> was delivered of a Son, who was named <HI>Garrinter.</HI> The <HI>Bohemians</HI> upon
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
this Occasion made great Rejoicings over all the Kingdom. And the King, as well to express his own Satisfaction at this happy In∣cident, as to comply with the Desires of the People, appointed Justs and Tournaments in Honour of the young Prince; to which not only many foreign Noblemen resorted, but also several neighbouring Kings and Princes came to exercise their Valour and Judgment at these martial Entertainments.</P>
<P>The Sports lasted twenty Days, during which Time the King made a general Feast for all his Subjects; and the Kings and Prin∣ces, who had been royally entertained, re∣turned home to their respective Countries, full of Admiration of the great Magnificence of <HI>Pandosto.</HI></P>
<P>The Smiles of Fortune are seldom sincere or lasting; the fickle Goddess, weary of be∣stowing Favours upon <HI>Pandosto,</HI> while he was wholly taken up in the Enjoyment of them, prepared a sad reverse of Fate for him and the lovely <HI>Bellaria. Pandosto,</HI> from his earliest Youth, had contracted and maintained a strict Friendship and Correspondence with <HI>Egistus,</HI> the young King of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince being desirous of shewing that neither Time nor Distance of Place could weaken the Force of his Affection for <HI>Pan∣dosto,</HI> resolved to visit him in his own Domi∣nions, to congratulate him upon his Marriage and the Birth of a Son. For this Purpose he ordered a small Fleet to be prepared, and with
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
a small but select Number of Attendants ar∣rived in <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> and his Queen, with a numerous Retinue, went to meet <HI>Egistus</HI> at his landing, and carried him to the Palace in the midst of most expensive Shows and magnificent Arches, which had been prepared and erected for his Reception.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto,</HI> whose Heart overflowed with grateful Transport for this Demonstration of Friendship in <HI>Egistus,</HI> intreated his Queen to shew all imaginable Respect and Esteem to a Prince whom he loved so much, and to whom he was so highly obliged.</P>
<P>The sweet <HI>Bellaria,</HI> who had no other Will but that of her Husband, was easily pre∣vailed upon to comply with a Request to which her own Inclinations naturally incited her, for the noble Qualities she observed in <HI>Egistus</HI> had al∣ready produced suitable Effects in a Mind, that being virtuous and sensible to the highest Degree itself, could not chuse but love those Perfections in another.</P>
<P><HI>Bellaria</HI> therefore, as well in Obedience to her Husband's Commands, as in Consequence of the Friendship she had conceived for <HI>Egistus,</HI> gave him every Day a thousand innocent Marks of her Esteem, which that Prince, who admired and loved her Perfections with all the Warmth of a disinterested Friend, did not fail to return with every Instance of Gra∣titude and Respect.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>This mutual Esteem gave rise to an easy Confidence and familiar Intercourse between them; so that <HI>Pandosto</HI> being often engaged with his Ministers in Affairs of State, <HI>Bellaria</HI> and <HI>Egistus</HI> passed away the Time in his Ab∣sence in various Discourses and innocent A∣musements, all which at first was very pleas∣ing to <HI>Pandosto.</HI></P>
<P>But that unhappy Prince, either because he was conscious of the superior Merit of <HI>Egistus,</HI> or through the natural Bent of his Disposition, began to look with suspicious Eyes on a Friend∣ship and Familiarity which he had been so soli∣citous to form: Doubtful and uneasy Thoughts arose in his Mind, he reflected on the irressist∣able Charms of <HI>Bellaria,</HI> and the manly Beauty and noble Qualities of <HI>Egistus,</HI> and thought it impossible that two Persons so formed to please should be insensible to each others Merit.</P>
<P>These Doubts having entered his Mind, he fed his growing Jealousy with continual Ob∣servations on the Looks and Words of his Friend and Wife; and prejudiced as he now was, their innocent Familiarity appeared to him to be a convincing Proof of their guilty Passion; Suspicion was now changed to abso∣lute Certainty; he no longer looked upon <HI>Egistus</HI> as his Friend and Guest, but as the Destroyer of his Honour, and the Violater of his Queen.</P>
<P>A violent Hatred succeeded the tender Af∣fection he once bore to <HI>Egistus;</HI> and those Smiles of Love with which he had always
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
been accustomed to behold the charming <HI>Bellaria,</HI> gave Place to sullen Reserve and gloomy Frowns: Racked with the torment∣ing Remembrance of his fancied Wrongs, the Desire and Hope of Revenge afforded him some Intervals of Ease.</P>
<P>He resolved therefore to poison <HI>Egistus,</HI> and while his Mind was labouring how to execute his cruel Purpose with Security, his Words and Behaviour still wore an Appearance of Friendship and Respect.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> had a Cup-bearer, named <HI>Franion,</HI> whom, because he had always shewn an inviola∣ble Attachment to his Person, he believed it would be easy to persuade to execute his purposed Vengeance on the King of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>To this Man therefore the jealous Mo∣narch communicated his ungenerous Design, and promised him a large Reward, if when the next Time that <HI>Egistus</HI> called for Drink at his Table, he would put Poison in his Cup.</P>
<P><HI>Franion</HI> shuddered with Horror at this in∣human Proposition; and with all the Freedom of a good Man and a faithful Subject he en∣deavoured to dissuade his King from his bar∣barous Purpose. He represented to him that Murder was an unpardonable Offence to the Gods, and abhorred by all Mankind, that such unnatural Crimes not only drew down the Wrath of Heaven upon the Perpetrators of them, but the Revenge of Men. He urged to him the sacred Laws of Hospitality,
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
that <HI>Egistus</HI> was his Guest, his Friend and Ally; that any Cruelty committed upon his Person would brand his Name with perpetual Infamy, and sow the lasting Seeds of Discord and Hatred between the <HI>Sicilians</HI> and <HI>Bohemi∣ans;</HI> and that even his own Subjects would murmur at such an unexampled Piece of Cruelty and Treachery.</P>
<P>These Arguments had no Force with the determined <HI>Pandosto,</HI> who, persisting still in his cruel Resolution, gave <HI>Franion</HI> his Choice either to poison <HI>Egistus,</HI> and be rewarded with Riches and Honours, or to suffer Death for his Disobedience.</P>
<P><HI>Franion,</HI> staggered by these dreadful Threat∣nings on one Hand, and allured by those great Promises on the other, told <HI>Pandosto</HI> that he would obey him, and as soon as a fair Opportunity offered he would poison <HI>Egistus.</HI></P>
<P>The King was very well pleased with this Promise, and resolved as soon as his designed Vengeance on <HI>Egistus</HI> was executed, to sa∣crifice <HI>Bellaria</HI> in the same Manner, to his abused Love and injured Honour.</P>
<P>When the King was departed, <HI>Franion</HI> having no longer that dreadful Object before his Eyes, threatening Death and Torments if he did not murder the innocent Prince, be∣gan to reflect seriously upon the horrid Deed he had engaged to perform: Murder he thought, however secretly and securely committed, might for a Time avoid Danger, but never wholly escape Punishment; that no Balm, no Leni∣tive
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
could heal the Stings of a wounded Con∣science, and the Guilt of innocent Blood would always be accompanied with Remorse and Horror.</P>
<P>He reflected that, though he was a Subject, his King had no Right to his Obedience when his Commands were contrary to the express Will and Pleasure of the Gods, to whom he owed a higher Duty.</P>
<P>He considered, that the peaceful Calm of a contented Mind in an humble Condition was preferable to the restless Turbulence of Dignity and Riches, when purchased with Crimes and stained with Blood, and that honest Poverty was infinitely better than shameful Grandeur.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that he must either die with a clear Mind, or live with a foul and spotted Conscience; his Soul was so perplexed be∣tween these two Extremes that he could take no Rest; at last he determined to discover the Affair to <HI>Egistus,</HI> and for that Purpose he went to his Apartments, and desiring a private Au∣dience of the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> he was admitted to his Presence, and in a few Words laid open the whole Conspiracy against him.</P>
<P>The Brave and Generous are not easily in∣duced to believe those they love are capable of Baseness and Ingratitude. <HI>Egistus</HI> judging of <HI>Pandosto</HI>'s Heart by the Rectitude of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s own, told <HI>Franion</HI> with a severe Countenance, that he would not entertain a Thought to the Prejudice of the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI>'s Honour.</P>
<P><HI>"Pandosto,</HI> continued he, is my Friend and Ally, no Suspicion has ever yet interrupt∣ed
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
our mutual Affection, I did not come here to invade his Territories, to seduce his Sub∣jects from their Allegiance, or to conspire with his Enemies. Since therefore I have given him no Cause to seek my Death, I can∣not believe him guilty of so unjust and trea∣cherous a Design; but rather suspect the In∣formation you have given me to be the Ef∣fect of a Combination among the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> to create a Variance between me and their King."</P>
<P><HI>Franion</HI> replied, "that it was dangerous to dally with the Rage of an incensed and secret Enemy; that if the <HI>Bohemians</HI> had intended any Harm to him they might easily accomplish it without revealing their Conspiracy; that it was unkind therefore in his Majesty to mis∣construe his Zeal for his Preservation into a treacherous Design, for that his Intention was to prevent Treason, not to become a Traitor."</P>
<P>He urged him then to fly with Speed in∣to <HI>Sicily</HI> if he hoped to escape the Danger which threatned him, and begged his Majesty would permit him to go along with him, when if he did not fully prove that <HI>Pandosto</HI> had de∣signed to poison him, he desired that his ima∣gined Treachery might be punished with the most cruel Torments.</P>
<P><HI>Egistus,</HI> weighing the Matter thoroughly in his Mind, gave many Thanks to <HI>Franion,</HI> and promising if he arrived safe in <HI>Sicily</HI> to re∣ward him royally; he desired him to contrive the Method of their Escape.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/><HI>Franion</HI> went immediately to consult with the Admiral of <HI>Egistus</HI>'s Fleet, and it was agreed between them, that it should be put in Readiness to sail as soon as a fair Wind and Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>Franion</HI> amused <HI>Pandosto</HI> with Hopes of soon having his so much de∣sired Revenge accomplished, telling him that he was employed in preparing and compound∣ing so subtle a Poison, that the Moment it was swallowed would procure immediate Death.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> received this News with a malignant Joy, every Hour seeming an Age to his im∣patient Fury till His Revenge was satiated with the Death of those who had offended him.</P>
<P><HI>Egistus</HI> being informed that a favourable Gale had sprung up, conveyed himself and his <HI>Sicilians,</HI> by the Assistance of <HI>Franion,</HI> out of a Postern Gate of the City, with such Secresy and Expedition, that they got on board their Ships without the least Suspicion, and spread∣ing all their Sails to the Wind soon lost Sight of <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Pandosto</HI> was informed that <HI>Egistus</HI> had fled away in the Night, and that <HI>Franion</HI> was gone with him, he let loose all his Rage upon his Queen, whom he accused of conspiring with <HI>Egistus</HI> and the Traitor <HI>Franion,</HI> and commanded she should be led to Prison.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> were all alarmed, and sus∣pected some Treason; and the furious <HI>Pandosto</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
believing the Queen not only guilty of disho∣nouring his Bed, but of projecting the Flight of <HI>Egistus,</HI> sent his Guards with Orders to seize her.</P>
<P>The innocent <HI>Bellaria</HI> not expecting the impending Storm, was playing with her lit∣tle Son <HI>Garrinter,</HI> when the Guards, with much Reluctance, came to execute the King's Demands.</P>
<P>The Queen was at first astonished and turned pale, but recollecting herself, and as∣suming all the noble Pride of conscious Inno∣cence and affronted Virtue, she gave her Hand to the Captain of the Guard, and without murmuring, suffered him to lead her to her Prison, where she spent the Time in patient Sorrow and absolute Resignation.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto,</HI> mad with the Disappointment of his Revenge upon <HI>Egistus,</HI> resolved it should fall doubly heavy on the Head of the injured <HI>Bellaria,</HI> he therefore caused it to be proclaim∣ed throughout all his Dominions, that the Queen had committed Adultery with <HI>Egistus,</HI> and with his Cup-bearer, <HI>Franion,</HI> had conspir∣ed his Death.</P>
<P>Though the Queen's Life had hitherto ap∣peared blameless, yet this confident Proclama∣tion, and the Flight of the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Franion,</HI> raised many Suspicions against her in the Minds of the People, who notwithstand∣ing daily offered up Prayers for her Deli∣verance.</P>
<P>Her Youth, her Beauty, the Sweetness of her Manners, but above all her Misfortunes, excited every one's Compassion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>But the cruel <HI>Pandosto,</HI> in whose rocky Bosom Pity could find no Access, resolved to load the unfortunate <HI>Bellaria</HI> with every Kind of Infamy and Hardship; he would not allow her to be treated in the Prison with the Respect due to the Rank she once held, but caused her to be served and attended with the most cruel Neglect.</P>
<P>The Cruelties he exercised on the Queen did but in Part satisfy his Revenge, he longed to make <HI>Egistus</HI> feel the Weight of his Fury: But this Monarch was so powerful by his Al∣lies, having married the Emperor of <HI>Russia</HI>'s Daughter, that he despaired of ever being able by open Force to accomplish his Re∣venge.</P>
<P>The unhappy Queen being informed of the vile Accusation against her so openly proclaimed, conscious of her own spotless In∣nocence, and the Integrity of <HI>Egistus,</HI> earnest∣ly intreated that she might be brought to a public Trial, confronted with her Accuser, and allowed to answer for herself.</P>
<P>But the King was so inflamed with Rage and Jealousy that he would not receive her Petition; and while the poor Queen was thus languishing under the Weight of her Calami∣ties, and hopeless of Redress, she perceived herself to be quick with Child.</P>
<P>So affecting an Incident in her melancholy Condition drew Complaints from her, which softening the rugged Temper of her Keeper;
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
he caused the King to be immediately inform∣ed of it, not doubting but the News would induce him to set her at Liberty.</P>
<P>The Queen's Pregnancy however produced quite a contrary Effect; for the King no sooner heard of it than starting up in a violent Fury, he swore <HI>Bellaria</HI> and her Bastard should die, even though the Gods themselves should say no.</P>
<P>The Queen, notwithstanding so many cruel Afflictions, was happily delivered of a Daughter; and <HI>Pandosto</HI> immediately declar∣ed his Resolution to have both the Mother and Child burnt.</P>
<P>The Noblemen of his Court used all the Arguments their Reason and Humanity could furnish them with, to prevail upon him to change his barbarous Purpose, but all they could do was to prevent the Murder of the Child.</P>
<P>The Queen's Doom he told them was ir∣revocably fixed, but though at the earnest So∣licitations of his Nobles, he promised the Child should not be put to Death, yet the Resolution he took concerning it was little less cruel, since by it he only meant to protract its Faté.</P>
<P>He sent a Person to the Prison with Orders to take the Infant from its wretched Mother, and putting it into a Boat and launching it into the Sea, leave it to the Mercy of the Wind and Waves.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>The Guards who assisted at this barbarous Deed, moved by the sweet Countenance of the innocent Babe, could not help accusing the King of great Cruelty; nevertheless Fear of his Resentment obliged them to execute his Commands.</P>
<P>They put the Child into a Boat, covering it with Boughs to preserve it from the Incle∣mency of the Weather, and set it into the Ocean, when immediately so great a Storm arose, that it was with much Difficulty they got to shore again.</P>
<P>This horrid Deed accomplished, the King assembled his Nobles and Counsellors, and <HI>Bellaria</HI> was brought into Court, where she heard the Charge against her read.</P>
<P>The Queen, who saw nothing but her Death would satisfy the incensed King, con∣fiding in her own Innocence, assumed all the Courage her unhappy Condition required, and with a noble Haughtiness demanded to have Law and Justice; "for Mercy, said she, I do not expect; let my Accusers therefore appear in Court, and give their Evidences be∣fore my Face."</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> replied, "that the Witnesses were of such Credit that their Words alone were sufficient; that for her, indeed it was her Part to deny such a monstrous Crime, and forswear herself, seeing that she had overcome all Sense of Shame and Remorse in committing it; ne∣vertheless,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
added he, you shall die, and die a most cruel and ignominious Death."</P>
<P>The Queen, not terrified by these Threats, replied without any Emotion, "that to pro∣ceed to Punishment without Proof, was Ri∣gour, not Law."</P>
<P>The Nobles approved of what she said, and required that her Accusers should be sworn and openly examined; and if the Queen's Guilt was fully proved, his Majesty might condemn her to suffer the Punishment ordain∣ed by the Law for such Offences.</P>
<P>The King answered, "that in this Case he could and would dispense with the Law, and that the Nobles should take his Word for suf∣ficient Evidence, otherwise he would make the proudest of them repent it.</P>
<P>This Threat struck them all dumb, but <HI>Bellaria,</HI> who despaired of Life, and dreaded Infamy more than Death, said, "if his Will must be the Law, the Jury's Verdict will be useless: Then falling on her Knees, she conjured the King by the Love he bore to the young Prince <HI>Garrinter</HI> his Son, that he would grant her one Request, which was to send six of his Nobles, in whom he placed the greatest Confidence, to the Island of <HI>Delphos,</HI> and there consult the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> con∣cerning the Crimes she was accused of."</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> could not refuse so reasonable a Request, and having named six Embassadors to be dispatched with all Speed to <HI>Delphos,</HI> he
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
committed the Queen to close Imprisonment till their Return.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors performed their Voyage in three Weeks, and as soon as they landed at <HI>Delphos,</HI> they went to the Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and with great Devotion offered Sacrifices to the God, and Gifts to his Priests, according to Custom, and then humbly besought an Answer to their Demands.</P>
<P>They had not kneeled long at the Altar, when <HI>Apollo</HI> with a loud Vice said, <HI>"Bohemi∣ans,</HI> what you find behind the Altar take and depart;" they obeyed the Oracle, and found a Scroll of Parchment, which the Priest com∣manded them not to open but in the Presence of the King.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors assured him of their ex∣act Obedience to his Injunctions, and their Devotions being finished they left the Tem∣ple, and sailed with a fair Wind for <HI>Bohemia,</HI> where they soon arrived, and hastened to Court.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> received them very graciously, and they after giving him an Account of their Voyage, presented the divine Scroll to him, intreating him at the same Time, since the Queen's Life or Death, her Innocence or Guilt, was contained in that sacred Writing, that he would summon the Nobility to meet in the Judgment Hall, and before them and the accused Queen cause the Oracle to be read.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>The King approved of their Advice, and on the Day appointed the King and the No∣bles being all assembled in the Court, the Queen was brought to the Bar, and thus spoke.</P>
<P>"How I have led my Life before <HI>Egistus</HI> came into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> I appeal, <HI>Pandosto,</HI> to thy Conscience, and to the immortal Gods; they only know whether I am guilty of the Crimes whereof I am accused; for me, I here protest my Innocence, and for the Truth of what I say, I refer myself to the divine Oracle.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Bellaria</HI> being silent, the King com∣manded one of his Nobles to open the Scroll, which he did, and read aloud the following Words, which were written in Letters of Gold.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The ORACLE.</HEAD>
<P>"Suspicion is no Proof; Jealousy is a par∣tial Judge; <HI>Bellaria</HI> is chaste, <HI>Egistus</HI> blame∣less, <HI>Franion</HI> a true Subject; <HI>Pandosto</HI> trea∣cherous; his Babe innocent, and the King shall die without an Heir, if that which is lost be not found."</P>
<P>After the Oracle was read the Court re∣sounded with joyful Acclamations; the Queen's Innocence thus manifested, filled every Heart with Transport.</P>
<P>The King beginning now to be ashamed of his rash Jealousy and unjust Suspicions, not
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
daring to approach the wronged <HI>Bellaria,</HI> desir∣ed his Nobles to implore her to forgive the In∣juries he had offered her; and stung with Re∣morse and Horror at his past Actions, he pub∣lickly confessed his Design against the Life of <HI>Egistus.</HI></P>
<P>While he was thus laying open his own Treachery, a Messenger came hastily into the Court, and informed the King that the Prince <HI>Garrinter</HI> was dead.</P>
<P><HI>Bellaria,</HI> whose Soul had been overwhelm∣ed with Joy by the divine Oracle, which had declared her Innocence, was seized with such an Excess of Sorrow at these dreadful Tidings, that her tender Heart, not able to support the Force of these contrary Extreams, burst with the mighty Weight, and sinking down she expired in a Moment.</P>
<P>The King became senseless at this dreadful Sight, and being carried to the Palace, not∣withstanding all the Endeavours of the Physici∣ans he lay speechless three Days.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> were in the utmost Despair, nothing but Mourning and Complaints were to be seen and heard; the Death of the Queen and Prince, and the extream Danger the King was in, filled the whole City with Grief and Consternation; at length he recovered his Senses and his Speech, and this News in some Measure revived the drooping <HI>Bohemians.</HI></P>
<P>But the King's Despair was so violent that he attempted to murder himself, and was with
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Difficulty prevented by his Nobles, who used all the Arguments they could think of to calm his Mind and perswade him to bear his Mis∣fortunes patiently.</P>
<P>Their dutiful Cares at last succeeded, the King grew more patient and resigned, and gave Orders for the Interment of his Queen and Son, which was performed in the most solemn and splendid Manner.</P>
<P>Once in every Day he went to <HI>Bellaria</HI>'s Tomb, and with Tears of Penitence and Sorrow lamented her unhappy Fate, and his own Misfortunes.</P>
<P>Here we must leave this distressed Prince for a while, to relate what befell the Royal In∣fant whom we left floating on the Ocean.</P>
<P>The Boat in which it was laid being tost for two Days with the Wind and Sea, and every Moment ready to perish in the Waves; it pleased the Gods to direct it at last to the Coast of <HI>Sicily,</HI> where it was drove on Shore.</P>
<P>It fortunately happened that a Shepherd who had missed one of his Sheep, not finding it in any of the Covers hard by, came to the Sea-side in Hopes it was there browsing on the Sea-Ivy, and hearing the Voice of a Child, which he at first mistook for the Bleating of a Sheep, went to the Sands and saw a Boat driven on Ground; he immediately waded to∣wards it, and discovered a most beautiful Babe lying at the Bottom, wrapt in a Scarlet
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Mantle embroidered with Gold, and a Chain of rich Jewels about its Neck.</P>
<P>The Shepherd, astonished at this Adventure, beholding the Beauty of the Infant, and the Riches that were about it, began to think it was some little Divinity, and was going to adore it; when the weak Cries of the Child, who seemed to be just perishing with Cold and Hunger, persuaded him it was a meer Mortal.</P>
<P>Compassion took the Place of Reverence; he approached the Child, took it into his Arms, and supposing by the extraordinary Magnificence of its Dress that it was of noble Birth, he resolved to carry it to the King.</P>
<P>As he was wrapping the Mantle close about it to preserve it better from the Cold, a Bag of Money fell from it at his Feet; which he take∣ing up, was so captivated with the Sight, that changing his Design he determined to breed up the Infant himself, and apply the Money to his own Use; then returned a bye Way to his Cottage lest any one should per∣ceive what he carried in his Arms.</P>
<P>As soon as he entered the Door the Child began to cry; which alarming his Wife, who supposed he was bringing home a Bastard to nurse, she rated him very severely for his In∣fidelity.</P>
<P>The Shepherd begged her to be pacified, and told her if she would be secret and cauti∣ous their Fortunes were made for ever; then
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
putting the Child in her Arms he produced the Gold and Jewels he found with it, which so pleased the poor Woman that she resolved to nurse the Child carefully, and make their Neighbours believe it was their own.</P>
<P>The Gold and Jewels they concealed, and the Shepherd returned to the Care of his Flocks, while his Wife employed herself in nursing the Foundling, to whom they gave the Name of <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>
<P>In a few Years after the Shepherd purchas∣ed a good Farm, and from tending the Flocks of other People became Master of a consi∣derable one himself.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fawnia</HI> arrived at the Age of ten Years, <HI>Porrus</HI> and <HI>Mopsa,</HI> for so her supposed Father and Mother were called, committed the Care of their Flocks; to her, and the young Shepherdess, whose Beauty at those early Years was the Astonishment and Admiration of all that beheld her, applied herself with the ut∣most Diligence to her pastoral Employment, so that every Thing prospered under her Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> now purchased Land, which he de∣signed to leave <HI>Fawnia</HI> at his Death; and she growing to fifteen Years old, many of the rich Farmer's Sons made their Addresses to her.</P>
<P>The fair Shepherdess was not the only Ad∣miration and Wonder of the Country, her Wit and Judgment was equal to her Beauty, and
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
those uncommon Charms of Mind and Per∣son made her even be talked of at Court.</P>
<P>She who believed herself to be the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Porrus,</HI> was not elated with the Praises that were bestowed on her, but with a sweet Humility conformed to the Lowliness of her Condition, and tended her Flocks with the utmost Diligence and Care.</P>
<P>Though she was not vain of the Graces of her Person, yet her rural Habit was always exactly neat, her lovely Hair was bound up with a graceful Negligence, and she took Care to choose the freshest and most becoming Flowers to compose the Garland which shaded her charming Face from the Sun.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sicily</HI> had only one Son, named <HI>Dorastus,</HI> a beautiful and accomplish∣ed Youth, of whom the <HI>Sicilians</HI> had great Hopes.</P>
<P>The King, desirous of seeing him married before he died, sent an Ambassador to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> to demand the Princess <HI>Euphania</HI> his Daughter, and the Heir to his Dominions, in Marriage for the Prince of <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> agreeing to the Proposal, <HI>Egistus</HI> acquainted his Son with the Treaty he had entered into; he enlarged on the Beauty and Virtues of the Princess <HI>Euphania,</HI> on the Advantages of an Alliance with the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and concluded with praising the Gods for the happy Success of his Negociation.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/><HI>Dorastus</HI> heard all this with such apparent Indifference that the King was amazed, and asked him if he had any Objection to the Match?</P>
<P>The Prince answered coldly, "That his Heart was yet a Stranger to Love, that all Women were indifferent to him, and that Marriage was an Engagement he had no In∣clination to enter into."</P>
<P>The King, extremely offended with this Reply, threatened him with the severest Effects of his Displeasure if he did not endeavour to conform to his Will; and finding the Prince continued in a sullen Silence, and would give him no Satisfaction, he quitted him in great Displeasure.</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus</HI> was sensibly afflicted at his Fa∣ther's Anger, and ardently wished he could conquer that Repugnance he felt in his Soul to Marriage, that he might not offend him by an absolute Refusal; but the more he struggled to overcome that Dislike which forced him to seem disobedient to his Father, the deeper he found it rooted in his Breast.</P>
<P>A short Time after this Discourse had pas∣sed between the King and the Prince, there happened to be a Meeting of all the Shep∣herds Daughters in <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> was chosen Queen for the Day, and drest in her best Cloaths presided over their rural Sports; the Day being past in such innocent Diversions as Shepherdesses, when
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Evening approached they separated, and <HI>Fawnia</HI> desiring a neighbouring Sheperdess to go with her to see if her Flock was folded, <HI>Dorastus,</HI> who was returning from Hawk∣ing, met the two Virgins as they were going home, and struck with Admiration at the Beauty of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> he stopt and asked her se∣veral trifling Questions, in order to have an Opportunity of gazing on her.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> aswered him with so much sprightly Wit and so graceful an Air, that the Prince already half vanquished by the Charms of her Person, was wholly subdued by those of her Mind. Love, offended at the former Obsti∣nacy of this young Rebel, resolved now to make him feel the utmost Effects of his Power, and with the keenest Arrow in his Quiver, pierced that once insensible Heart.</P>
<P>The Prince sighed with Pain and Pleasure; he could not remove his Eyes from the lovely Face of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> which was all overspread with a rosy Blush; he saw her Confusion, and ashamed of his own Weakness he resolved to force himself away, and clapping Spurs to his Horse he hastily bid the Shepherdesses farewel, and rode home to the Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia,</HI> who had surveyed the Prince with a curious Eye, began as soon as he was gone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o praise him to her Companion; she admired his Youth, his Beauty, his sweet Affability: The pleasing Theme transported her beyond her usual Moderation, her Thoughts were
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
full of the Prince's Perfections, she could not find Words sufficient to express her Admira∣tion; she perceived at length, and blushed at, her Indiscretion, and remained silent and com∣posed during the rest of their Walk.</P>
<P>She took Leave of her Companion at the Door of her Cottage, and retired to Bed full of a pleasing Anxiety for which her inexperi∣enced Innocence could not yet find a Name.</P>
<P>The Prince, whose Mind was still more restless and uneasy than <HI>Fawnia</HI>'s, because he better understood the nature of his Distemper, passed the Night in various and tormenting Thoughts: Fain would he have banished the sweet Image of <HI>Fawnia</HI> from his Remem∣brance, but Love had engraved it too deeply in his Heart, and finding his Endeavours to for∣get her fruitless, he sought to excuse and justify his Passion, by reflecting on the inevitable Charms of her that caused it.</P>
<P>"Oh, cruel! oh, injurious Fortune! cried he, transported with the bright Idea, to hide such Perfection in a Cottage, and lavish Crowns and Scepters often on Deformity."</P>
<P>"Oh! <HI>Fawnia,</HI> was that inchanting Form made only to grace the Fields? were these bright Eyes ordained to shine in humble Vales, and only bless rude Swains with their Love darting Beams? was that sprightly Wit and those native Graces of thy Mind given thee to be for ever clouded in a Cottage?"</P>
<P>"Ah! no, it cannot be, the Gods are just and equal in their Dispensations, and though they did not make you born a Princess, they did more, and made you deserving to be one;
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
I am their Instrument to raise you to the Rank for which Nature designed you, and which no other can so worthily fill.</P>
<P>The amorous Prince paused at these Words, then suddenly giving Way to new Reflexions, "How would it please my Father, cried he, to know that my Heart is capable of Love? oh! divine Law, feared by all Men, because honoured by the Gods themselves."</P>
<P>"But alas! <HI>Dorastus,</HI> added he, breathing a deep and dreadful Sigh, who is it that is the Object of thy Passion? a rural Maid, the Daughter of a simple Shepherd. Does this Match suit with the Dignity of thy Birth? thou who art the Son of a King, and Heir to a powerful Kingdom. Ah! let me rather die than poorly submit to such a shameful Weak∣ness; for 'tis better to perish nobly than to live with Contempt."</P>
<P>The wavering Prince, resting a while upon this thought, endeavoured to collect his whole Force of Reason to support a Resolution which seemed worthy of himself; but Love, who laughed at all his vain Attempts to elude his Power, again imprest the lovely Image of <HI>Fawnia</HI> upon his Fancy.</P>
<P>"Oh! Beauty, said the sighing Prince, how absolute is thy Empire over the Heart! sweet and imperious Tyrant thou shalt be obeyed, I yield to thy irresistable Force; yes <HI>Fawnia,</HI> lovely and adorable <HI>Fawnia,</HI> thou shalt be mine, thy humble Birth shall be no Obstacle to my Desires."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>"The Gods themselves have not disdained to love; <HI>Jupiter</HI> was enamoured of <HI>Danaë,</HI> and the bright <HI>Apollo</HI> woed the inexorable <HI>Daphne;</HI> these were mortal Beauties, and they were Deities; why then, though a Prince, may not I love a Shepherdess? but their Pas∣sions were dishonourable, mine is pure and chaste, 'tis true, and herein I surpass the Gods: Be still then, oh my Soul, for 'tis decreed <HI>Fawnia,</HI> the adorable <HI>Fawnia</HI> shall be mine."</P>
<P>The Prince having thus taken his Resolu∣tion, his Mind grew easy and composed, but it was far otherwise with the charming Shep∣herdess, strange and unusual Dreams perplex∣ed her roving Fancy the whole Night.</P>
<P>That homely Couch, which before had only supplied calm and unrufled Slumbers, and chearful Dreams of pleasant Labour and in∣nocent Amusements past, now gave Birth to anxious Wishes, delusive Hopes, and uneasy Repinings.</P>
<P>She awaked, but not as usual refreshed with her Repose; her renewed Spirits sparkling in her chearful Eyes, and eager to begin the rural Labours of the Day, but heavy, languishing, and full of uneasy Perturbations, she rose be∣fore her wonted Hour, and thinking to banish the various Thoughts which tormented her by industrious Toils; she drove her Flocks to the Field, shifted the Folds, and doubled her Morning's Work; at last fatigued and breathless she sat down at the Foot of a Tree, and thus began to accuse the Folly and Pre∣sumption of her new Passion.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>"Unfortunate <HI>Fawnia!</HI> said she softly sigh∣ing, thy Shepherdess's Hook expresses thy mean Condition, and thy Desires shew thy aspiring Mind: Ah! simple Maid, Thoughts above Fortune bring Contempt, 'tis for the Eagle only to gaze on the Sun, art thou not a poor Shepherdess? the Daughter of a Country Swain? be content then to stand securely in the Vale, and do not by endeavouring to climb the Hills hazard the Danger of a Fall: But oh! Love is a powerful Lord and will be obeyed. I love <HI>Dorastus,</HI> ah! the more wretch∣ed I, the less Cause I have to hope: Will Eagles catch at Flies? or Cedars stoop to Brambles? <HI>Dorastus</HI> is a Prince, and knows what his Sta∣tion requires of him, I am the poor Daugh∣ter of a Shepherd, and forget my humble Con∣dition."</P>
<P>"Cease then to love unhappy <HI>Fawnia,</HI> or if thou canst not do that, conceal at least thy wrong placed Passion, for it is better to die with Grief than live with Shame; but oh, Gods! why did you give me a Soul capable of the most exalted Passion? and yet place me in a Condition which makes that Passion Pre∣sumption?"</P>
<P>The lovely Shepherdess having thus given Vent to her uneasy Thoughts, rose up and be∣gan to walk round her Flock, gathering up he straggling Sheep to prevent them from go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng among the Corn, and while she was thus employed, endeavoured to conquer her too much raised Desires, by contemplating her
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
mean Estate, and the apparent Impossibility of ever accomplishing her Wishes.</P>
<P>Mean Time <HI>Dorastus,</HI> consumed away with impatient Desire, his former Pleasures now grew tasteless to his Sense, Company was tedious, Music only soothed his sweet Disorder, and added Fewel to his Fires.</P>
<P>Weary at length of the intolerable Restraint his Pride had forced him to lay upon his Wishes, he resolved to satisfy his longing Eyes with another Sight of the sweet, but dangerous <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>
<P>For this Purpose he stole secretly out of the Palace, and without any Attendants took his Way to the Fields where he had first seen the beauteous Shepherdess <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>
<P>There he walked some Time without meet∣ing with the Object his passionate Eyes were every where in Search of. Enraged at his Dis∣appointment, a thousand Times he curst both Love and Fortune, and just as he was resign∣ing himself to the most bitter Despair for his ill Success in this first Attempt, a casual Glance discovered <HI>Fawnia</HI> to him, sitting on the Side of a Hill, selecting the most beau∣tiful Flowers out of a large Heap, which in sweet Confusion were scattered about her to make a fresh Garland for her Head.</P>
<P>The passionate Prince stood at a little Dis∣tance for some Moments, contemplating her with an Excess of Wonder and Delight, when <HI>Fawnia</HI> happening to look up, she met
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
his ardent Gaze, and this sudden and unexpected Sight gave her so much Emotion, that her fair Face was in an Instant dyed with a rosy Blush.</P>
<P>She rose however from her Seat and curt'sied to the Prince, but with such native Ele∣gance and Grace, that <HI>Dorastus,</HI> who could not conceive how a Country Maid bred up in the Fields and Woods could have so much Politeness in her Manner, was lost in Asto∣nishment and Admiration.</P>
<P>"Fair Virgin, said he approaching her, either your Poverty is great, or the Life of a Shepher∣dess is very sweet, that you can take such De∣light in rural Labours, is it because you are so like a Nymph that you resolve to imitate the Nymphs, and waste your Days in Woods and Lawns? Tell me, sweet Maid, what Plea∣sures are there in a Country Life to balance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Fatigue?"</P>
<P>"Sir, said <HI>Fawnia,</HI> with an inchanting Bashfulness, to be contented is to be rich, that Condition is most to be coveted in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is most Tranquility; as we Shepherdesses are not born to Honour, and little beholden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Beauty, so Fame or Fortune is beneath our Care; we are not solicitous for any Thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Necessaries of Life; we think our Rayment fine, if it preserves us sufficiently from the cold, and our Food dainty if it suf∣fices Appetite; our greatest Enemy is the Wolf, and our Chief Care is to keep our Flocks in Security; we spend the Day in rural
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
Songs, and delight more in talking of Pan and Country Sports, than <HI>Venus</HI> and her trifling Toys; our Toil is to shift our Folds, but the attending our Flocks is only an agree∣able Amusement; our Wealth consists in not desiring more than we possess; our Honour in not aiming to be higher than we are; Envy looks not so low as a Shepherd; Shepherds do not raise their Thoughts to Ambition, we are rich because we are content with our Poverty, and proud only in knowing we have no Cause to be proud."</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus</HI> was charmed with this sprightly Answer: Oh! thought he, if this fair Crea∣ture's Birth was equal to her Wit and Beauty, she would be a Wife for the greatest Prince in the World.</P>
<P>"I perceive, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> said the Prince, ad∣dressing himself to her again, that 'tis owing to your not being acquainted with the Enjoy∣ments of a Court, that you are so contented with a Country Life; I commend your Wit and Prudence, but I pity your Poverty and low Condition. Will you forsake your Fa∣ther's Cottage, and attend on a Lady a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Court?"</P>
<P>"'Tis dangerous, Sir, answered <HI>Fawnia</HI> to tempt Fortune; she is a fickle Goddess and often raises poor Mortals only to throw them down again: I was born to toil for the Court, and not live in it, and am entirely sa∣tisfied with my present Condition."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33"/>"Ah! <HI>Fawnia,</HI> said <HI>Dorastus,</HI> with a Sigh he could not suppress, I guess the Cause of your Fondness for a rural Life, you love a Country Shepherd."</P>
<P>"Sir, replied <HI>Fawnia,</HI> smiling, pardon me if I tell you, you have not guessed right: Shep∣herds! alas, they cannot love they are so sim∣ple, and Maids must not if they are no older than I am."</P>
<P>"In my Opinion, pretty one, said the Prince, Maids ought to love because they are young, Cupid is a Child, and the Goddess of Love is painted young?"</P>
<P>"Age may indeed be painted with false Colours, said <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and Youth may have Actions too forward but what Art too little conceals in one, Ignorance reveals in the other."</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus,</HI> who thought this Conversation the most pleasing of any he ever had, would have perhaps drawn it out to a conside∣rable Length, but perceiving some of his At∣tendants approaching, he was willing to know a little more of her Heart before he parted from her.</P>
<P>"Perhaps, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> said he, taking her Hand, I love thee; if so you must needs yield me your Heart, for I am a Prince you know, and may command you."</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34"/>"I acknowledge your Power, Sir, said <HI>Fawnia,</HI> in all just and reasonable Things, but with Submission, I must say my Heart is only at my own Disposal; constrained Love is Force, and Force you have no Right to use over me: and believe me, it is not a vain Beast I make, when I tell you that poor as I am I set so great a Value upon my Chastity, that I would rather die than be the Mistress of the greatest King upon Earth, and my Birth is so mean and groveling that I am not fit to be a Farmer's Wife."</P>
<P>The lovely Shepherdess ended these Words with a Sigh, which escaped her unawares.</P>
<P>The Prince, after a little Pause, replied, "It seems then, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> that you cannot love <HI>Dorastus."</HI></P>
<P>"Yes, said <HI>Fawnia</HI> precipitately, when <HI>Dorastus</HI> becomes a Shepherd."</P>
<P>The Prince's Attendants being now come near, he hastily went to meet them, leaving <HI>Fawnia</HI> alone and pensive, her Imagination filled with a thousand new Ideas.</P>
<P>She seated herself again at the Foot of the Hill, revolving in her Mind all the Prince had said to her, and this second View of him, to∣gether with the Affability of his Behaviour, and some flattering Hopes she began to enter∣tain, entirely compleated the Conquest of her Heart.</P>
<P>For some Moments she resigned herself up to the most soothing Reflexions, but when the Lowness of her Condition rushed upon her
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
Thoughts, and broke the sweet Delusion she was so fond of, then she began to blame the Extravagance of her Wishes, and tried to re∣collect her scattered Reason.</P>
<P>"Ah! <HI>Fawnia,</HI> whispered she, why dost thou gaze at the Sun and grasp at Wind? Stars are to be beheld at a Distance, not aimed to be touched with the Hand; Hopes are to be measured by Fortune, not impelled by Desire, and Falls come by climbing high, not by sit∣ting low. But what then? added she after a little Pause, must all fall who endeavour to rise because some do? no, Happiness comes by Chance, and Fortune winds those Threads which the Destinies spin. Alas! what strange Perplexity am I in, favoured by a Prince, yet obliged through Prudence to reject that Fa∣vour, Denial in my Words, and Desire at the bottom of my Heart; I love <HI>Dorastus,</HI> yet I seem displeased with his Courtship. Ah! 'tis our Sex's Fault to fly from those we eagerly wish to meet. But take Heed, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> said she sighing, for if the Prince is repulsed by thy Shyness, thou wilt severely repent; for un∣less he loves thou must die. Ah! die then, simple Maid, for <HI>Dorastus</HI> only jests with thee, <HI>Dorastus</HI> cannot stoop to love a Shep∣herdess; sit down then in thy Sorrow, and pine in secret. Ah me! how am I changed? I was wont to pass away my Days in chearful Songs, now I waste them in Sighs and Com∣plaints."</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36"/>While <HI>Fawnia</HI> was thus giving Vent to the tender Anxieties of her Soul, the Approach of Night put her in Mind that it was Time to put her Sheep in the Fold, which having done with a heavy Heart, she hastened to her poor Cottage.</P>
<P>While Love made this Havock in the inno∣cent Breast of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> he raged with such Violence in the Heart of the passionate Prince, in which the Pride of royal Birth maintained an unequal Conflict, that sinking under the Force of those contrary Passions, he became a Prey to Melancholy and Despair; he loathed his Food, Sleep fled from his Eyes, he grew pale and wan, and fell into a languishing Dis∣ease.</P>
<P>The King, amazed at the Alteration in his Son, and trembling for his Life, ordered the Attendance of the ablest Physicians in his Kingdom; but their Art was all in vain.</P>
<P>The Prince himself grew apprehensive of the Danger he was in, he found he could not live without <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and thought it great Folly to die for what it was in his Power to obtain; Honour long opposed the Gratificati∣on of his Desires, but Love, resistless Love, at Length prevailed.</P>
<P>The Prince, wholly abandoning himself to the Power of this sweet Tyrant, procured a Shepherd's Habit and a Crook, and making them to be conveyed to a secret Place, he
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
went privately out of the Palace, and attiring himself in those rural Weeds, took his Way to the Place where his charming Shepherdess fed her Flocks.</P>
<P>As he went along some uneasy Reflexions arose in his Mind when he surveyed his homely Dress.</P>
<P>"Ah! <HI>Dorastus,</HI> said he to himself, what a strange Alteration is here, a Prince transform∣ed to a Peasant! does this wild Folly suit with the Dignity of thy Birth? but indeed thy Habit suits well with thy groveling Thoughts; this is thy proper Dress, thou wert always dis∣guised before. Oh! Gods, for what Crime am I assigned this Penance? Oh! Love, what a fond Ideot hast thou made of me?"</P>
<P>"Yet why should I blush at this Disguise? have not the heavenly Deities descended to Earth, and changed their glorious Forms for Love? Love made <HI>Jupiter</HI> a Bull, <HI>Neptune</HI> a Ram, and <HI>Apollo,</HI> like myself, a Shepherd. If they who were Gods submitted to that all-compelling Power, shall I, who am a Mortal, dare to rebel against it."</P>
<P>While the Prince was thus justifying the strange Effects of his Passion by those great Examples, he spied <HI>Fawnia</HI> at a Distance, running after one of her Sheep which had strayed from the rest: The Sight of that lovely Face supprest in a Moment all other Emoti∣ons but those of Love and Joy.</P>
<P>He flew towards her, and she, who did not know him in that Disguise, but thought
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
it was some genteel young Shepherd coming to meet her, secretly wished it had been her Lot to have placed her Affections upon such a one, whom with Reason she might have loved, and hoped to have obtained.</P>
<P>The Prince's nearer Approach convinced her of her Mistake, she sighed and blushed with Pleasure and Surprize, and stopping curt'sied to him with her usual Gracefulness.</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus</HI> taking her Hand, prest it with passionate Tenderness to his Heart, and then fixing an ardent Kiss upon it, begged her to sit down and listen to him a few Moments.</P>
<P>The lovely Shepherdess, trembling with the mixed Emotions which Love, Hope, and Fear excited in her Soul, sat down with him un∣der the Shade of a spreading Oak, and the Prince, after gazing on her for some Time with a fixed Attention, thus spoke.</P>
<P>"You wonder <HI>Fawnia,</HI> no Doubt, at my strange Apparel, but if you knew my Thoughts you'd wonder more, the one indeed disgraces my outward Shape, but the others disturb my Mind."</P>
<P>"I love you, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> for how can I do otherways? formed as you are to inspire all who see you, with that Passion. You promised to love me when I became a Shepherd, be∣hold your Prince transformed to a Country Swain. Now then I claim the Performance of your Promise since I have fulfilled your Desire."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39"/>"'Tis true, my Lord, said <HI>Fawnia,</HI> you are changed in Appearance, but 'tis in Appear∣ance only; painted Eagles are not Eagles, and Zuexis' Grapes, as I have read, were only Paint∣ed Grapes; rich Ornaments do not make Prin∣ces, nor rural Weeds a Swain; Shepherds are not called so because they wear pastoral Attire, and have a Crook and Scrip, but because they at∣tend their Flocks, and take Care of their rural Affairs; this Apparel therefore has not made a Shepherd of a Prince, but makes a Prince appear like a Shepherd."</P>
<P>"Had I been born a Shepherd, replied <HI>Dorastus,</HI> I should have loved you willingly, and being a Prince I am constrained to love you, do not then with an unseasonable Coy∣ness reject a Passion which you only could have inspired, now is your Time to love and be beloved, while that sweet Bloom glows in your charming Face, and every Feature smiles with the Gaiety of Youth. Have you not observed the Fate of these beautiful Flowers with which you so often adorn your lovely Hair, they bud, they bloom, they wither and are neglected; such is your Beauty <HI>Fawnia;</HI> in Youth it is praised, admired, and coveted, in Age forgotten and despised, yield then to virtuous Love, for notwithstanding the Inequality of our Conditions, I mean to make you my Wife."</P>
<P><HI>"Fawnia,</HI> transported with Surprize and Joy at this unhoped for Declaration, no lon∣ger
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
kept up her forced Indifference, but be∣holding the Prince with a languishing Sweet∣ness, her Face being all o'erspread with Blushes, "Ah! my Lord, said she, I am ashamed to discover the Thoughts which have long filled my Mind: Ought I, Beggar as I am, to own my Desires have reached at a Prince? Oh! <HI>Dorastus!</HI> I dare not say I love you, because you are the Son of a great King, and I am a poor Shepherdess, but the Gods know how I have honoured <HI>Dorastus!</HI> receive then my humble, my dutiful Affection, and look on me as your Handmaid, ever ready to obey your Will in all Things which are not prejudicial to my Honour.</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus,</HI> overjoyed at this sweet and mo∣dest Confession of her Love for him, em∣braced her with a passionate Tenderness, cal∣ling all the Gods to witness the Vows he made her of everlasting Love and Fidelity, and now the Lovers began to consult upon the Measures they should take to be united for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus,</HI> who knew his Father would be excessively enraged at such a Match, told <HI>Fawnia</HI> there could be no Safety for them in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and that therefore he would provide a sufficient Quantity of Money and Jewels to support them till some favourable Change hap∣pened in their Affairs, and with the Treasure fly into <HI>Italy</HI> and there solemnize their Nuptials.</P>
<P>This Proposal was agreed to with great Joy by <HI>Fawnia,</HI> who trembled at the Thoughts of the King's discovering their Love, believing
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
that nothing less than Death would be inflicted on her for her Presumption: She therefore urged the Prince to make the necessary Pre∣parations for their Flight with the utmost Speed, lest Fortune should cruelly prevent their Intentions.</P>
<P>The Prince, whose eager Passion prompted him no less than her Fears to hasten their De∣parture, assured her all should be ready in a few Days, and now the approaching Night warn∣ing them to depart, he took Leave of <HI>Fawnia</HI> with a tender Embrace, and repairing to the Place where he had left his Cloaths, threw off his Shepherd's Frock and returned to the Pa∣lace.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> was so transported with the unex∣pected Tide of good Fortune which had come rushing on her, that for some Time she could hardly persuade herself that all was not a Dream; but when the Tumult of her Joy was a little allayed, and calmer Reflexions succeed∣ing, convinced her of the Reality of her Hap∣piness, she thanked the Gods devoutly for their amazing Bounty to her, and beseeched them to continue their Favour and Protection to her and her beloved Prince.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Dorastus</HI> lost no Oppor∣tunity of seeing his lovely Shepherdess; she drove her Flocks to the Fields every Day, and continued to watch them as usual, not from any Delight she now took in her pastoral Em∣ployment, but in the dear Hope of seeing her beloved Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/><HI>Dorastus,</HI> notwithstanding he always came to meet his <HI>Fawnia</HI> in the Habit of a Shep∣herd, was at last discovered by some that knew him to be the Prince; so that his frequent Visits to <HI>Fawnia</HI> making much Noise among the Country People, some of <HI>Porrus</HI>'s Neigh∣bours, out of good Will to the old Shepherd, advised him to keep his Daughter at home, and keep a strict Eye over her, lest by going so often to the Field she should bring him home a young Son at last, for that the young Prince came often to her, and would certainly, if he had not yet, delude her and make her his Con∣cubine.</P>
<P>This News greatly surprized and alarmed the good old Man, who, after thanking his Neighbours for their kind Informations, hasten∣ed home to his Wife, and calling her aside, and wringing his Hands, the Tears fast falling down his aged Cheeks, "O Wife! said he, I fear, I fear our Daughter <HI>Fawnia</HI> has com∣mitted Sin, and that she will buy Repentance at a dear Rate: I have sad News to tell you: My Neighbours tell me that the young Prince <HI>Dorastus</HI> looks upon <HI>Fawnia</HI> with a wistful Eye, and if that is the Case I would not give a Wisp of Straw for her Honesty at the Year's End.</P>
<P>"I tell thee, Wife, that Beauty is a great Snare to entrap young Men, and fair Words and fine Promises are great Enemies to a Maiden's Honesty; the Poor may entreat and be refused, but Princes, if Entreaties won't

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, may command, and then who can resist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem?</P>
<P>"But it is a hard Case though, said the old Man, sobbing, where the Lust of a Prince is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Law, and that he should bind poor Folks to that which he himself freely breaks."</P>
<P>"Take heed what you say, said the good Wife, with a sagacious Look; speak no more than you should, lest you hear what you would not; do what you can, but no more than you may; great Streams may be stopped by Art, but not by Force; take Care of yourself, lest by en∣deavouring to save <HI>Fawnia</HI>'s Honesty you lose your own Head: It is dangerous, the Proverb says, to play with edged Tools, and bad to sport with Princes; remember the Wolf had his Skin stripped over his Ears for looking in∣to the Lion's Den."</P>
<P>"You speak like a Fool, said <HI>Porrus,</HI> who could not relish his Wife's sage Council, if the King should hear that <HI>Dorastus</HI> loves our Daughter, his Fury would be such that we might lose our Goods, if not our Lives. A Thought has just now entered my Head, by which I will prevent the King's being offend∣ed with us, and perhaps it may not dis∣please the Prince: I will carry the Chain and Jewels I found with <HI>Fawnia</HI> to the King, and confess that she is not my Daughter, and tell him the whole Story of my finding her; the King may perhaps take her under his own Care, and then whatever happens we shall be blameless."</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44"/>The good Wife was well enough pleased with this Proposal, and it was resolved between them to take the first Opportunity of speaking to the King.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Dorastus</HI> had com∣municated his Design of leaving <HI>Sicily</HI> to a faithful Domestic, who had attended his Person from his Childhood, named <HI>Capnio.</HI> This Man at first endeavoured to dissuade him from so rash and dangerous an Enterprize, but finding the Prince determined to depart, he ceased to trouble him with any more fruit∣less Expostulations, and prepared to assist him in the Prosecution of a Design, which, though he did not approve, he saw it was impossible to prevent, unless by betraying his Master to the King, a Piece of Treachery he could not bring himself to commit, being bound as well by his own Inclinations, as a sacred Oath the Prince had made him take to the contrary.</P>
<P>He therefore with great Secrecy and Expe∣dition provided a Vessel to transport them to <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Prince having furnished himself with a great Quantity of Money and Jewels, gave Orders to <HI>Capnio</HI> to get some rich Apparel for <HI>Fawnia;</HI> the Baggage was all safely con∣veyed on board, and the Master of the Ship perceiving the Wind likely to be favourable in a few Hours, he gave <HI>Capnio</HI> Notice that they must come on board early the next Morning.</P>
<P><HI>Capnio</HI> having informed the Prince of this, he sent him to <HI>Fawnia</HI> desiring her to be in the Fields by break of Day, where he would meet her and carry her to the Port.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45"/>She slept but little that Night: Love, Fear and anxious Expectation kept her waking. At the first Dawn of Light she rose, and unfold∣ing her Sheep, drove them to the Fields, giv∣ing many a longing look for her beloved Prince; at last he appeared on Horseback, she ran eagerly to meet him, and he dismounting, after printing a hasty Kiss upon her trembling Lips, took her up behind him, and galloped as fast as possible to the Haven where the Ship lay.</P>
<P>The Sailors perceiving him at a Distance rowed to Shore with their Boat, and taking in the Lovers, carried them safe on board, where we must leave them to see what happened at Land.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> having heard that the King intend∣ed to take the Air that Morning, put on his Holiday Cloaths, and taking the Chain and Jewels he found with <HI>Fawnia</HI> concealed in his Bosom, he took his Way to the Palace, in∣tending to watch the King's coming out, at the Gate.</P>
<P>Fortune, determining to favour the Lovers a little longer, flung <HI>Capnio,</HI> who was hasting to the Port with a Casket, in the old Man's Way.</P>
<P><HI>Capnio</HI> seeing him taking the Road to the Palace, and knowing him to be the Father of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> asked him where he was going so early?</P>
<P><HI>Porrus,</HI> who knew him to be a Courtier, replied, that Prince <HI>Dorastus</HI> had dealt very hardly with him; I have but one Daughter,
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
said the good Man, who, to say the Truth, has some share of Beauty, I have Reason to apprehend the Prince has seduced her, and I am going to complain to his Majesty of this Injury.</P>
<P><HI>Capnio</HI> immediately foreseeing all the fatal Consequences that might attend the old Man's Complaint at that critical Time resolved to prevent it, and therefore began to wheedle him by blaming the Prince for so unworthy a Design, and added, because he was a poor Man and had no Friends to stand by him, himself would assist him in all he could, but, said he, you will lose your Labour if you go to the Palace; for the King designs to take the Air to day on board a Ship that lies in the Harbour, and is already set out; therefore if you will be ruled by me, as I am going to give them Notice of his Majesty's coming that they may be prepared to receive him, I will take you with me, and place you so conveniently, that you shall have all the Liberty you can de∣sire to make your Complaint.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> thanked his new Friend with great Submission for his proffered Kindness, and went with him to the Port, still complaining of the Prince, but concealed the Chain and Jewels, and mentioned nothing concerning <HI>Fawnia</HI>'s being a Foundling.</P>
<P>The Sailors seeing <HI>Capnio,</HI> sent a Boat for him, but now <HI>Porrus</HI>'s Heart failed, he be∣gan to suspect some Design upon him, and when <HI>Capnio</HI> asked him to go into the Boat he refused, under Pretence of being afraid of the
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
Sea; <HI>Capnio</HI> pressed him, but to no Purpose; whereupon, as there was no Time to be lost, he ordered the Mariners who came in the Boat to carry him in by Force.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> now saw he was betrayed, but think∣ing it would be fruitless to cry out or exclaim against his false Friend, he civilly entreated him and the Sailors to be kind to him, and pity his Condition, who was but a poor Man and lived by his Labour, and should be undone if he was absent long from his Flocks.</P>
<P>But they were as deaf to his Entreaties as the Winds and Waves to the Prayers of sink∣ing Mariners, and laughed to see him so much afraid; having reached their Ship they obliged him to go on board, where the first Objects he cast his Eyes on, were the Prince and <HI>Fawnia.</HI></P>
<P>She being drest in rich Apparel, he scarce knew her at first, so much was her native Beau∣ty heightened by the Magnificence of her Cloaths, in which she appeared with such a graceful Ease, that it seemed as if she had ne∣ver been accustomed to any other.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> stood gazing on her at a Distance, greatly astonished at what he saw, and won∣dering where it would end; and the Prince and <HI>Fawnia</HI> who were equally surprized to see him there, eagerly asked <HI>Capnio</HI> for what Pur∣pose he was come?</P>
<P><HI>Capnio</HI> informed them that he met him as he was going to complain to the King of the Injury he suspected the Prince had offered him in the Person of his Daughter, and that he had prevented his Design by Artifice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd brought him forcibly to the Ship, adding
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
that it was absolutely necessary they should take him with them to <HI>Italy,</HI> otherwise their Dis∣covery would be inevitable.</P>
<P>The Prince approved this Advice, but <HI>Fawnia,</HI> who loved and respected the old Shep∣herd as her Father, heard this Resolution with great Concern.</P>
<P><HI>Porrus</HI> understanding that he should be car∣ried from his Wife, his Country, and Friends, into a strange Land, burst into Tears and Complaints, and falling on his Knees, earnest∣ly entreated <HI>Dorastus</HI> to pardon his rash Folly, and permit him to return home, assuring him he would be as secret as the Grave: But the Prince could not be prevailed upon by all his Protestations to hazard the Danger of a Dis∣covery, and though <HI>Fawnia</HI> herself with Tears conjured him to grant her Father's Request, he continued obstinate in his Refusal, assuring her their Ruin was inevitable if he complied: <HI>Fawnia</HI> then applied herself to comfort the old Man as well as she could, and the Ship with a fair Gale pursued her Voyage.</P>
<P>While this passed at Sea, <HI>Egistus,</HI> who in∣tended to hunt that Morning the Prince de∣parted, sent to desire his Son's Company in that Diversion, hoping it would help to re∣move the Melancholy which had of late hung upon him.</P>
<P>The Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber re∣turned Answer, that the Prince went that Morning very early to walk as he supposed in the Grove as was his daily Custom; whereupon
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he King sent some of his Attendants to look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Prince in that Place, but they coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack without him, the King attended by his No∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les, went to the Chace, and after spending the Day, in hunting returned to the Palace; sur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rized at not finding his Son yet come home, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ordered strict Search to be made for him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is not appearing that Night filled him with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>housand uneasy Apprehensions, and the next Day Messengers were dispatched all over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdom to seek for him.</P>
<P>The unhappy King at length supposing he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad fallen a Prey to the wild Beasts in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orest, ordered several Parties of Horse to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our the Country round, and if possible bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m some Intelligence of his Fate.</P>
<P>Some of these Men meeting a Fisherman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear the Sea-side mending his Nets, they en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ired if he had seen or heard any thing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Prince, and he very ingenuously told them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at a few Days ago he had seen the Prince, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith <HI>Fawnia</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Porrus,</HI> the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hepherd himself, and <HI>Capnio,</HI> all go on board <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ship which instantly put off to Sea.</P>
<P>This News was immediately carried to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, who, full of Surprize and Grief, or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered the Wife of <HI>Porrus</HI> to be brought before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, and examined her himself concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Flight of her Husband and Daughter with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Son.</P>
<P>The old Woman told the King that her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eighbours had informed her Husband the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rince was too familiar with his Daughter, he apprehending
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
something worse would follow, and hearing his Majesty intended to hunt a few Days ago, he rose early in the Morning with an Intention to complain to his Majesty of the Injury he feared the Prince intended to do <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and added, with Tears, that she had never seen her Hus∣band since.</P>
<P><HI>Egistus</HI> perceiving the unfeigned Simplicity with which she told her Tale, dismissed her; but reflected so deeply upon the dishonourable Action his Son had committed, that he fell in∣to a Fever, and continued so weak and ill that his Physicians had no Hopes of his Recovery.</P>
<P>But <HI>Dorastus,</HI> who regarded neither Fa∣ther, Country nor Crown, now he was in Possession of his beloved <HI>Fawnia,</HI> never trou∣bled himself about the Grief his strange Flight would occasion the King and all the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> but resigned himself wholly up to the Contem∣plation of his present Happiness, which he would not have quitted for all the Empires in the World.</P>
<P>The Winds for some Time seemed to fa∣vour their Flight, and they steered their Course to <HI>Italy</HI> without any Interruption; but one Morning the Sky began to be over-cast with Clouds, the Winds grew high, the Sea swelled, and at last a Storm ensued, which raged during three Days with such unceasing Fury that the Ship was so much damaged the Sailors expect∣ed every Moment it would sink.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51"/>Poor <HI>Fawnia</HI> was almost dying with her Fears, but the Sight of <HI>Dorastus,</HI> who never left her a Moment, yielded her some Comfort amidst the Horrors of approaching Death: On the fourth Morning the Storm abated, and the Sailors discovered Land, which they soon knew to be the Coast of <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P>Their confused Shouts of Joy gave <HI>Dorastus</HI> to understand they were in Sight of some Har∣bour, and with Tears of Joy and Tenderness he congratulated <HI>Fawnia</HI> on their Safety.</P>
<P>But when he was told it was the Coast of <HI>Bohemia</HI> upon which they were driven, re∣membering the Enmity there was between the King of that Country and his Father, whom he had sought to poison, he was greatly per∣plexed, not knowing what to do; or whether it was better to trust to the Fury of the Winds and Waves than the Treachery and Cruelty of the inhuman <HI>Pandosto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Capnio,</HI> who saw it was impossible to ex∣pect any Safety at Sea, advised the Prince to conceal his Name and Country and take up his Residence in some small Village till they could procure a Ship to carry them to <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dorastus</HI> approved this Scheme, and ordered <HI>Capnio</HI> to bid the Ship's Crew give out that his Name was <HI>Meleagrus,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Tra∣palonia,</HI> and assure them in his Name of a large Reward for their Secrecy.</P>
<P>This done they went on Shore, and hired Lodgings at a Farm House in a Village, a Mile distant from the chief City of <HI>Bohemia</HI>; as soon as they were recovered from the Fatigues
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
they had endured at Sea during the Storm, <HI>Dorastus,</HI> impatient to be united to his be∣loved <HI>Fawnia,</HI> gave <HI>Capnio</HI> Orders to make Preparations for their Marriage.</P>
<P>But in the mean time the Fame of <HI>Fawnia</HI>'s Beauty was spread through all the Village, and from thence reached the City, and at last the Court; nothing was talked of but the lovely Stranger, whose wonderful Beauty was the Subject of general Admiration.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto,</HI> though at that Time above sixty Years old, was fired with the Reports he con∣tinually heard of this young Miracle, and was resolved to see her; and being informed they affected great Privacy, and lodged in a very mean House, he determined to have them seized on Suspicion of their being Spies, and brought before him in order to be examined by himself.</P>
<P>Accordingly he sent a small Party of his Guards to apprehend them, who coming to the House where they lodged, informed them that they must come before the King.</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus,</HI> not in the least daunted by this Message, took <HI>Fawnia</HI> by the Hand, and leaving <HI>Porrus</HI> to take Care of the <HI>Treasure,</HI> followed the Guards together with <HI>Capnio.</HI></P>
<P>Being introduced to the King, they paid their Obeisance to him with a respectful Con∣fidence that might have persuaded him of their Innocence had he really suspected them to have come into his Country with any bad Intention.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>But the King, at the first Glance of <HI>Faw∣nia,</HI> was so astonished at her wonderful Beauty, that, forgetting what he had to do for seve∣ral Minutes, he stood motionless like a Statue, not able to remove his Eyes from that en∣chanting Object; recovering himself at last, he turned to <HI>Dorastus,</HI> and asked him sternly who he was, of what Country, and with what Intent he had landed in <HI>Bohemia?</HI> "Sir, said <HI>Dorastus,</HI> with a Countenance unchanged, and a resolute Tone of Voice, my Name is <HI>Me∣leagrus,</HI> a Knight, born and bred up in <HI>Tra∣palonia;</HI> this young Woman, whom I intend to make my Wife, is a Native of <HI>Italy,</HI> from whence I brought her; the Reason I have so small a Train, is, that her Friends being unwilling to consent to her Marriage, I took her away privately with an Intent to carry her to <HI>Trapalonia;</HI> as we were sailing a vio∣lent Storm arose which drove us upon this Coast, and I propose to stay no longer here than till our Ship is refitted, and put into a Condition to pursue her Voyage."</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto,</HI> either not satisfied, or pretending not to be satisfied, with this Account, rose from his Seat in a Rage; <HI>"Meleagrus,</HI> said he, I am not to be imposed upon by this un∣likely Tale; this Lady appears to be of a much higher Quality than you represent her, and by the graceful Loveliness of her Person, fitter to be the Wife of a great Prince, than a simple Knight, as you declare yourself to be."</P>
<P>"You have stolen away this young Lady from her unhappy Parents, like a false Traitor,
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
and as you have made them miserable by your Theft, will, no doubt, shortly make her so too; therefore, till I can be thoroughly in∣formed of her Birth, and till you have pro∣duced a Certificate from <HI>Trapalonia</HI> to con∣firm the Account you have given of yourself, I will detain ye all in <HI>Bohemia."</HI></P>
<P>The noble Mind of <HI>Dorastus</HI> could but ill brook the base Suspicions and injurious Lan∣guage of <HI>Pandosto,</HI> and almost forgetting the Character he assumed he looked on him with a Frown of Anger and Disdain, and with a haughty Accent thus replied:</P>
<P>"It is unworthy the Honour and Dignity of a Prince to reproach any Man with having committed scandalous Crimes without any Proof of his Guilt, or even Suspicion to form a Belief on; inoffensive Strangers ought to be treated with Kindness and Benevolence, not with Distrust and Cruelty, which is contrary to the Laws of Nations, and the Customs of all civilized People; but the Gods will severely revenge the Cause of those, who, through In∣ability to right themselves, are obliged to put up with Wrongs and Injuries."</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> was so enraged at this bold and re∣solute Language, that he immediately ordered his Guards to carry the audacious Stranger to Prison, and likewise ordered all the Ship's Crew to be put in a close Dungeon. For <HI>Fawnia</HI> he ordered an Apartment in the Pa∣lace to be prepared, and recommended her to the Care of some of the Court Ladies.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/><HI>Dorastus</HI> heard the Order for his Confine∣ment with a contemptuous Silence, and fol∣lowed the Guards without deigning to cast a Look on the enraged King, and only by a passionate Glance at <HI>Fawnia,</HI> expressed the Anguish of his Soul at being thus torn from her.</P>
<P>She, with streaming Eyes, saw him depart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd retiring to the Apartment allotted for her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esigned herself up to the deepest Despair, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinued wholly insensible of all the Conso∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations that were offered her.</P>
<P>Mean Time <HI>Pandosto</HI> in whose old Bosom Love had again kindled a Flame, lost no Op∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortunity of seeing the beauteous Stranger, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t first, he fancied he was only giving Way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleasing Amusement when he sought the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight and Conversation of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon perceived that she was become necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Happiness.</P>
<P>His restless Anxiety when he was absent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om her, his disordered Wishes when with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, the Perturbations of his Mind when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought of <HI>Meleagrus,</HI> convinced him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is unknown Virgin had conquered his Heart; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e blushed at his own Weakness; he reflected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his advanced Age; his exalted Rank; on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Youth, Beauty, and mean Condition; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d sought for Reasons against his yielding to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Force of his misplaced Passions, Reasons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found many, but Love was stronger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n them all.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56"/>In vain he represented to himself that <HI>Fawnia</HI> loved the unknown Knight, and that a Heart already prepossessed with a young and amiable Object, was not likely to yield to his Sollicitations; his Passion seemed to gather Strength from the Obstacles which op∣posed it, and he resolved, if Persuasions failed, to make Use of all his Power, to compel <HI>Fawnia</HI> to his Desires.</P>
<P>For this Purpose he sent a Messenger to her one Day when he was walking in a Park be∣hind his Palace, to tell her he wanted to speak to her.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> went to him unwillingly, and as she approached, the King taking her Hand walked with her a few Steps, then stopping suddenly, he looked earnestly at her a Mo∣ment, and thus spoke.</P>

<P>The King, though greatly surprized and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rplexed with this resolute Answer of <HI>Faw∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a,</HI> yet would not give over his Solicitati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; when he found he could not prevail up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her to yield to his Desires by Promises of

<P>But <HI>Fawnia</HI> replied, "that she would not purchase his Liberty, ardently as she loved him, with the Loss of her Honour," and <HI>Pandosto</HI> seeing her so fixed in her Resolution not to forsake <HI>Meleagrus,</HI> would press her no further at that Time, and left her to her∣self.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia,</HI> as soon as she was alone, began with Sighs and Tears to bewail this new Mis∣fortune which had befallen her, anticipating by her Fears the Distresses her Refusal of the King's Offers might bring upon <HI>Dorastus</HI> and herself.</P>
<P>"Oh! unfortunate <HI>Fawnia,</HI> said she, how well has thy Presumption, in daring to love a Prince, been punished by the Calami∣ties thou endurest at present, and those greater ones which thou hast Reason to expect. Ah! fond and inconsiderate Maid, hadst thou been contented with the humble Condition of a Shepherdess, in which thou wert born, thou hadst escaped these Evils; but thy rash Folly has not only undone thyself, but ruined him whose Happiness is and ought to be dearer to thee than thy own!"</P>
<P>"Oh! <HI>Dorastus, Dorastus,</HI> thou who wert born a Prince, art now a Prisoner for my Sake; those Hands which were formed for Scepters are loaded with shameful Irons for
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
me, unworthy me, what Miseries has thy fa∣tal Passion for the wretched <HI>Fawnia</HI> brought upon thee? too lovely and too generous Prince, thou hadst been still great and happy but for me. Oh! that by my Death I could free thee from thy unworthy Bonds, but alas! thy Freedom can only be procured by the Sa∣crifice of my Honour, and that Sacrifice thou wouldst never consent to; no, my dear Prince, 'tis only by my Fidelity to thee that I can re∣quite thy wonderous Love, and here I swear by the immortal Gods, no Temptations, no Threats, not even of Death itself, shall ever make me forsake thee."</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia</HI> having thus given Vent to the se∣cret Sorrows of her Soul, retired to her A∣partment in the Palace, and past the melan∣choly Hours in bewailing the Confinement of her beloved Prince, and offering up Prayers to the Gods for his Deliverance.</P>
<P>Mean Time <HI>Dorastus</HI> in a close Prison, loaded with Irons like a common Criminal, and now a thousand bitter Reflexions rose in his Mind; Rage and Shame at the unworthy Treatment he received, made him sometimes regret his ill placed Passion, which had brought him into so wretched a Condition.</P>
<P>But this Thought seldom dwelt long upon his Mind, and he was more ready to accuse the Gods of Cruelty and Injustice for divide∣ing him from <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and subjecting him to such Miseries, than to repent the Folly that had caused them.</P>
<P>Oh! wretched <HI>Dorastus,</HI> would he cry, when assaulted by a vainly supprest Remorse,
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
oughtest thou in Reason to repine at thy Fate? are not worse Punishments, if possible, than what thou now endurest due to thy Unwor∣thiness and Folly? couldst thou expect to be favoured by Heaven, thou who didst forget the Duties of thy Station, and hast disgraced thy Rank and Dignity? the Wrath of Heaven is levelled at the Wretch who disobeys his Father, and oppresses his old Age with Shame and Sorrow, thou hast done this <HI>Dorastus,</HI> and mayst with Reason expect the severest Punishments will be inflicted on thee; behold me then ye Gods ready to suffer all your Ven∣geance, and willing to expiate my Offence by Death: But on me, on me only let loose all your Fury, spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the lovely, the innocent <HI>Fawnia,</HI> shield and defend her helpless Youth from the inhuman Tyranny of <HI>Pandosto,</HI> and if my Death can procure her Safety, hasten it ye heavenly Powers, and let my Punish∣ment attone for all."</P>
<P>While the two Lovers thus groaned under the cruel Tyranny of <HI>Pandosto,</HI> his Passion for <HI>Fawnia</HI> gave him no less Disquiet; her Denials instead of abating increased his unlawful De∣sires; his Discontent appeared in every Look and Action, so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Courtiers, who saw him al∣ways disturbed and uneasy, wondered from whence the sudden Alteration proceeded.</P>
<P>Though the resolute Behaviour of <HI>Fawnia</HI> in the last Interview he had with her gave him no Reason to hope for any Change in her Sen∣timents, yet being impatient to see her again and assail her Virtue with new Sollicitations,
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
he ordered her to be brought privately into his Apartment.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia,</HI> with great Reluctance, suffered herself to be conducted to his Presence, and the King, as soon as he saw her, ordered all his Attendants to withdraw, and with a sooth∣ing Look and Voice thus spoke to her.</P>
<P>"Well, charming <HI>Fawnia,</HI> have you consi∣dered upon the Purport of my last Conversa∣tion with you, when we walked together in the Park? are you become less obstinate, and more wise? Will you prefer the Love of a King to the Affection of a miserable Knight? I persuade myself you are not so insensible to the Charms of Ambition as not to think it better to be the Favourite of a King, than the Wife of a poor Subject."</P>
<P>"My Lord, replied <HI>Fawnia,</HI> I am sensible that I am in your Power, and have indeed severely felt the arbitrary Exertion of it; is it just, is it reasonable, my Lord, to inflict upon innocent Persons such Punishments as are only due to guilty ones? What Crime has <HI>Meleagrus</HI> committed against you that he must be loaded with Chains and confined in a horrible Prison? And what Right have you over my Person, that you detain me here in your Palace, and force me to listen to your infamous Proposals? <HI>Meleagrus</HI> has never attempted to seduce your Subjects from their Allegiance to you; why then do you attempt to allure me from the Fi∣delity I owe to him? but know, unjust Prince, though Fortune has put my Person in your
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
Power, my Mind can never be subdued, but disdains alike your Promises and Threats, I have vowed to keep myself for my beloved <HI>Meleagrus,</HI> and nothing but Death shall pre∣vent my keeping that <HI>Vow."</HI></P>
<P>"Is it possible then, said <HI>Pandosto,</HI> that you can persist in refusing the Love of a King, for the Sake of that wretched Man? foolish and ungrateful Girl, you say you are in my Power, yet I forbear to use it to your Preju∣dice, and what I might compel by Force, am contented only to sue for, by Prayers; yield then and reward my ardent Passion with your Love, <HI>Meleagrus</HI> shall be set at Liberty, your Countrymen discharged, and all that your utmost Wishes can suggest, shall be fulfilled by a King who burns in Love for you."</P>
<P>"Why do you talk of Love? replied <HI>Fawnia,</HI> with a beautiful Disdain, you who are a Stranger to that godlike Passion, alas! 'tis Profanation to call the Inclination you have for me by the Name of Love, such Love as yours, my Lord, is worse than Death to a modest Virgin, and to avoid it I will freely sacrifice my Life. Well may you threaten me with your Power, you who are capable of making so ill an Use of it, but know, lasci∣vious Prince, that all your Power is insuffi∣cient to force me to a Crime the Gods ab∣hor, and since I dare die to preserve my Ho∣nour, your impious Attempt will gain you nothing but eternal Infamy."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63"/><HI>Pandosto,</HI> enraged at her unalterable Love for <HI>Meleagrus,</HI> and fixed Resolution to refuse his Offer, ordered her, with Eyes sparkling with Fury, to quit his Presence, swearing at the same Time that unless she disposed herself soon to yield to his Desires, he would force her to comply, whatever might be the Conse∣quences.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia,</HI> not in the least terrified at his Menaces, quitted his Apartment and retired to her own, arming her Soul with Fortitude to escape his threatened Force by Death, if Heaven afforded her not some other Means of Relief.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the King of <HI>Sicily</HI> was informed by some <HI>Bohemian</HI> Merchants, who had discovered <HI>Meleagrus</HI> to be <HI>Dorastus,</HI> that his Son was in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and confined in Prison by the King.</P>
<P><HI>Egistus,</HI> though extremely offended with his Son for his Disobedience and Desertion of him, yet could not hear of the shameful Treatment he received from <HI>Pandosto</HI> without feeling great Affliction; and reflecting that <HI>Bellaria</HI> and himself had been cleared by the Oracles of <HI>Apollo</HI> of the Crime the King sus∣pected them guilty of, he did not doubt but <HI>Pandosto</HI> would send back his fugitive Son, at the Request of his Ambassadors.</P>
<P>He therefore ordered a small Fleet, well manned to be prepared, and giving a Com∣mission to some of his principal Nobles to de∣mand
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
the Prince of <HI>Pandosto,</HI> they embarked and set sail for <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> received the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Ambassadors with great Respect, which filled them with Hopes of returning to their Master with Suc∣cess, and soon after their Arrival related to them the Adventure of the <HI>Trapalonian</HI> Knight, who he said had come into his Do∣minions in a very suspicious Manner, bring∣ing with him a young Lady, named <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and no Attendants but a Shepherd, and an old Man.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors immediately perceived this <HI>Trapalonian</HI> Knight was no other than their Prince <HI>Dorastus,</HI> but they dissembled the Matter for the present till the King granted them a public Audience, and then in the Name of their Sovereign they demanded the Prince of <HI>Sicily</HI> of him, who was in his Dominions under the Name of <HI>Meleagrus.</HI></P>
<P>They then proceeded to acquaint his <HI>Bohe∣mian</HI> Majesty that the Prince of <HI>Sicily</HI> had contrary to the Will of the King his Father, quitted the Kingdom, and carried with him a young Maid, named <HI>Fawnia,</HI> the Daughter of an old Shepherd, called <HI>Porrus,</HI> and that <HI>Capnio,</HI> one of the Prince's Attendants, had accompanied him in his Flight.</P>
<P>They concluded with telling the King that it was the Request of their Sovereign <HI>Egistus,</HI> that Prince <HI>Dorastus</HI> should be freed from his Confinement and sent home with them, and
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
that <HI>Capnio, Porrus,</HI> and his Daughter, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> should be put to Death.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> heard this Embassy with great A∣stonishment, and willing to reconcile himself to <HI>Egistus,</HI> and to shew how much he desired to renew their long interrupted Friendship, he resolved punctually to execute his Will, and to sacrifice <HI>Fawnia</HI> both to his Policy and his injured Love.</P>
<P>He therefore sent Orders immediately for the Release of <HI>Dorastus,</HI> who was greatly sur∣prized at this unexpected Favour, but he was still more so, when being conducted into the King's Presence, he saw several Noblemen be∣longing to his Father's Court, who, as soon as he appeared, approached, and paid their Duties to him with the utmost Respect.</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto</HI> rising from his Chair of State em∣braced him with many Expressions of Tender-and Respect, mingling Apologies for what had passed, while his Birth and Quality were un∣known, then seating him on his right Hand, he declared to him the Purport of the Embassy, he had received from the King, his Father.</P>
<P><HI>Dorastus,</HI> in great Confusion to find the Cause of his Flight was thus publickly known, held down his Head to hide the Blushes which overspread his Face, but when the King went on to relate the Punishment that he was required to inflict upon <HI>Fawnia</HI> and that other Partners of his Flight, he was not able to conceal the strong Emotions of his
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
Soul, but in the most passionate Terms he ex∣claimed against the Cruelty and Injustice of his Father, and earnestly conjured <HI>Pandosto</HI> not to execute so inhuman a Sentence.</P>
<P>The King, without being moved by his In∣treaties, ordered <HI>Fawnia, Capnio,</HI> and <HI>Porrus</HI> to be brought before him, and giving Way to the Fury of his Resentment against <HI>Fawnia,</HI> whose noble Resistance had changed the For∣mer Love he bore her into Hatred, he accost∣ed the trembling Maid with these reproachful Words.</P>
<P>"Mean and contemptible Wretch, said he, how durst thou raise thy dazled Eyes to Honour, and in thy base born Soul nourish the Flames of Ambition. Was it for thee, thou Beggar, to entertain Hopes of marrying a Prince? and practise Arts to induce the Son of a great King to forsake his Country to gratify thy insolent Desires? but know, thou dangerous Syren, Death shall be the Reward of thy daring Ambition; and thou old doat∣ing Fool, said he, to the pale trembling <HI>Porrus,</HI> whose insolent Folly has prompted thy Daugh∣ter to this rash Undertaking, thy Life shall pay for thy Presumption."</P>
<P>"But for thee, <HI>Capnio,</HI> added the enraged King, Death is too easy a Punishment, thy Treason and Falshood merits something worse, I therefore condemn thee to have thy Eyes put out, and till thou diest grind continually in a Mill, like a blind Horse."</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67"/><HI>Dorastus,</HI> whom the Sentence that was past on <HI>Fawnia,</HI> had thrown into a silent Agony of Grief, Rage, and Despair, perceiving they were about to lead her away, rose up to speak in her Defence, but overcome with the Vio∣lence of these different Emotions, he sunk down again in his Chair, without any Appear∣ance of Life.</P>
<P>By the timely Assistance of the King's Physicians he recovered, his Senses, and at their Instances, he was removed from the Sight of <HI>Fawnia,</HI> who, as soon as he was taken out of the Room, spoke in this Manner.</P>
<P>"If my Death will be the Means of pro∣curing Peace and Happiness for Prince <HI>Doras∣tus,</HI> who is my betrothed Lord, and whose sacred Vows, the Gods have heard, and regis∣tered in Heaven, and which no Power on Earth can dissolve, I am then content to die, but my innocent and tender Passion for him, I shall carry to my Grave; my last Breath shall be spent in begging Blessings for him, in im∣ploring the Gods to shed their choicest Gifts upon him, that when he succeeds to the Throne of his Father, he may rule his Sub∣jects with Prudence, Equity, and Moderati∣on, for Wisdom and Mercy are divine Attri∣butes, and a Monarch's true Safety and Hap∣piness consists in the Love, and not the Fear of his People. Behold me then, O King, prepared to suffer all the Rigour of your Sen∣tence. But oh! my Father, what has he done, that his gray and venerable Hairs must
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
by Violence be brought to the Grave, alas! he is absolutely innocent of the Engagement, between the Prince and me; he neither coun∣sel'd my Flight, nor consented to accompany me in it, but was brought forcibly on board the Ship, and compelled to be the Partner of our Voyage; must he then die for an invo∣luntary Crime? Oh unjust and cruel Destiny! —But who art thou, King <HI>Pandosto?</HI> who judgest thus the Subjects of another King, who not having committed any Thing worthy of Punishment, since they came into thy Terri∣tories, hast nevertheless passed Sentence of Death upon them? But something within me says thou hast a Power to judge <HI>Fawnia</HI>; be it so then; and welcome Death, which will bring me to those Regions of Bliss, where eternal Justice, Mercy and Compassion reigns.</P>
<P>The old Shepherd, moved with the af∣fectionate Entreaties of <HI>Fawnia</HI> in his Favour, and perceiving there was no more Hope of Life, resolved, before he died, to discover that she was not his Daughter, and, after entreat∣ing a few Moments Audience, spoke thus:</P>
<P>"King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and ye noble Ambas∣sadors of <HI>Sicily,</HI> seeing that I am, though inno∣cent, condemned to die, I am willing to dis∣burthen my Conscience of a Secret I have too long concealed: I will tell ye as much as I know, and no more than is true: <HI>Fawnia,</HI> who has been disdained as a vile Beggar, is not my Daughter; I found her, and thus it hap∣pened: Being a poor Shepherd in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and living by keeping other Mens Flocks, upon a
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
certain Day, one of my Sheep straying down to the Sea-side, I went to look for it, and saw a little Boat driven upon the Sands, wherein I found a Babe, about six Days old, wrapt in a scarlet Mantle, with a Chain about its Neck: Compassion moved me to take Care of the Child, and being covetous of the Treasure I had found with it, I carried it home to my Wife, who nursed it as her own, and when it grew up set it to keep Sheep; this Lady, <HI>Faw∣nia,</HI> is the Child whom I found, and here is the Chain and the Jewels that were about her; who she is, and of what Parentage, I know not, but I solemnly declare she is not mine."</P>
<P><HI>Pandosto,</HI> who had with Difficulty re∣strained his Emotions while <HI>Porrus</HI> war speak∣ing, as soon as he was silent, impatiently de∣manded to know the Season of the Year when he found this Babe, the Boat in which it was laid, and several other Circumstances; and ful∣ly satisfied with his Answers, he suddenly sprung from his Seat, and in a Rapture of pa∣ternal Affection, he catched <HI>Fawnia</HI> in his Arms, bathing her tender Face, which he pressed close to his own, with Tears of Sur∣prize and Joy, and crying in broken Accents, "Oh, <HI>Fawnia!</HI> my long lost Daughter! I am thy Father, <HI>Fawnia."</HI></P>
<P>These Exclamations and sudden Passion filled all that were present with Amazement, especially <HI>Fawnia,</HI> who stood motionless with Surprize, her lovely Face expressing at once the Extremes of Joy, Hope, Fear and Won∣der.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/><HI>Pandosto,</HI> as soon as the first Violence of his Transports was abated, sent for <HI>Dor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stus,</HI> who was by this Time perfectly restored to his Senses, and holding <HI>Fawnia</HI> by the Hand, he declared, that she was his Daughter, of whom his Wife <HI>Bellaria,</HI> had been delivered while she lay under the false Suspicion of Adultery, and was therefore by his Orders ex∣posed in an open Boat to the Fury of the Waves: He then ordered <HI>Porrus,</HI> to tell the Prince where he had found her, and his Re∣lation finished, he again embraced her, and publicly acknowledged her for his Daughter.</P>
<P><HI>Fawnia,</HI> now assured of the Reality of her Happiness, indulged her Joy at this unex∣pected good Fortune; Dorastus was transport∣ed out of himself, and the <HI>Sicilians</HI> no longer repined at their Prince's Choice, but rejoiced in the Expectation that the Enmity which had so long subsisted between <HI>Egistus</HI> and <HI>Pandosto,</HI> would now be changed into a firm Friend∣ship and perpetual Peace between the King∣doms of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P>The News was soon spread through <HI>Pan∣dosto</HI>'s Dominions; the Streets rung with Ex∣clamations of Joy for the King's having found his Daughter, and that there was now a law∣ful Heir to the Crown of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> nothing but magnificent Shews were every where to be seen, and the most extravagant Demonstra∣tions of Joy.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71"/>The King conferred the Honour of Knight∣hood on old <HI>Porrus,</HI> who had been so long the reputed Father of <HI>Fawnia;</HI> and causing a no∣ble Fleet to be put in readiness to sail, he em∣barked with <HI>Dorastus, Fawnia,</HI> and the <HI>Si∣cilian</HI> Ambassadors, with a numerous Retinue, and soon arrived at <HI>Sicily,</HI> where he was kind∣ly received by <HI>Egistus,</HI> who was perfectly sa∣tisfied with his Son's Fortune.</P>
<P>The nuptial Ceremonies between the Prince and Princess were performed with great Mag∣nificence; and soon after, <HI>Pandosto</HI> giving way to a thousand gloomy Reflexions, which the Consideration of his unjust Jealousy of <HI>Bellaria,</HI> his designed Cruelty to <HI>Egistus,</HI> but above all his unnatural Passion for his Daughter, had inspired, a deep Melancholy seized his Spirits, which turning to a Phrenzy, he one Night, took Advantage of the Absence of his Attend∣ants, and stabbed himself with a Dagger.</P>
<P>His Death was much lamented by <HI>Dorastus, Fawnia</HI> and the good <HI>Egistus;</HI> his Body being embalmed, the young King and Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> took Leave of the King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> their Father, and carried the Corpse of the deceased Monarch with them to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> where the funeral Obsequies were performed with great Splendor; and they ascended the Throne, to the universal Joy of the whole Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the Use <HI>Shakespear</HI> has made of the foregoing Novel in his Play called The <HI>Winter's Tale.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Fable of the <HI>WINTER's TALE.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>POLIXENES,</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Leontes,</HI> King of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> having been bred together in their Youth, and maintained a strict Friendship and Correspondence with each other after they succeeded to the Thrones of their Fathers; <HI>Polixenes</HI> desirous of seeing again his beloved Companion, pays him a Visit in his own Dominions, where, after staying a con∣siderable Time, he proposes to take Leave and return to his own Kingdom; but <HI>Leontes,</HI> un∣willing to part with him, presses him to a lon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Stay; <HI>Polixenes</HI> refuses; whereupon <HI>Leon∣tes</HI> desires his Queen <HI>Hermione</HI> to solicit him; she obeys; and <HI>Polixenes,</HI> at her Request, con∣sents to remain a little longer in <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leontes</HI> takes Occasion, from the Earnest∣ness of his Wife's Entreaties and the easy Compliance of <HI>Polixenes,</HI> to suspect them both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Adultery; and growing furious with Jea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousy, he endeavours to persuade <HI>Camillo,</HI> one
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
of his Courtiers, whom he had made Cup-Bearer to <HI>Polixenes,</HI> to poison him.</P>
<P><HI>Camillo</HI> promises to perform his Orders, but secretly discovers them to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> who, thus warned, makes his Escape by Night, accompanied by his Preserver, <HI>Camillo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leontes,</HI> enraged at their Flight, and sup∣posing that his Queen was privy to it, pub∣licly accuses her of Adultery with <HI>Polixenes,</HI> and of conspiring with <HI>Camillo</HI> to take away his Life.</P>
<P><HI>Hermione</HI> is sent to Prison, where she is deli∣vered of a Daughter: <HI>Paulina,</HI> an old Lady, Friend to the Queen, carries the Child to <HI>Leontes,</HI> who swears it is a Bastard, and threat∣ens to have both it and the Mother burnt; be∣ing with Difficulty dissuaded from this cruel Resolution, he orders <HI>Antigonous,</HI> the Hus∣band of <HI>Paulina,</HI> to carry the Child to some desert Place, quite out of his Dominions, and there leave it.</P>
<P><HI>Antigonous</HI> being instructed in a Dream how to dispose of it, carries it into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and leaves it in a Wood, but as he is returning to his Vessel, he is devoured by a wild Bear, and the Ship is wrecked.</P>
<P><HI>Leontes</HI> having sent Messengers to <HI>Delpho</HI> to consult the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> concerning hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Queen's Infidelity; as soon as they return, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Queen is brought to her Trial, and her Ac∣cusation

being read, which she courageously denies, and refers to the Oracle, it is broke open and read aloud, and pronounces her In-her Inocence.</P>
<P>The King declares the Oracle is false, and orders the Court to proceed in the Tryal, when a Messenger brings him an Account of the sudden Death of the Prince his Son, the Queen falls into a Swoon at this News, and is carried out.</P>
<P><HI>Leontes,</HI> believing the Death of his Son to be a Punishment for his Profanation in deny∣ing the Truth of the Oracle, repents his un∣just Accusation of <HI>Hermione,</HI> asks Pardon of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and resolves to make his Queen Amends, for the Injuries he had offered her.</P>
<P>While he is making these penitent Reso∣lutions, <HI>Paulina</HI> enters, and informs him the Queen is dead. <HI>Leontes,</HI> in great Affliction, vows to visit her Tomb once in every Day while he lives, and weep ever it.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the little <HI>Perdita,</HI> his Daughter, is found by a <HI>Bohemian</HI> Shepherd, who breeds it up as his own Child: Prince <HI>Florizel,</HI> the Son of <HI>Polixenes,</HI> falls in love with <HI>Perdita,</HI> and resolves to marry her. The King, his Father, discovers his Intention, and threatens <HI>Perdita</HI> with Death if she ever again presumes to receive his Son's Addresses; <HI>Camillo,</HI> who ardently desired to visit his own Country, <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and his old Master <HI>Leontes,</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
persuades Prince <HI>Florizel,</HI> since he was deter∣mined not to quit <HI>Perdita,</HI> to steal her away and carry her to <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and feign an Embassy from his Father to <HI>Leontes,</HI> which would se∣cure him a kind Reception.</P>
<P><HI>Florizel</HI> goes on board a Ship with <HI>Perdita,</HI> and sails to <HI>Sicilia,</HI> where he is received with great Friendship by <HI>Leontes,</HI> but immediately after King <HI>Polixenes</HI> himself arrives, having been persuaded by <HI>Camillo</HI> to follow his Son, and prevent his Marriage with <HI>Perdita.</HI></P>
<P>The supposed Father of <HI>Perdita</HI> having been decoyed on board the Prince's Vessel, as he was going to the King to discover how he came by <HI>Perdita,</HI> and to show him the Tokens he found with her; she is by his Means discovered to be the Daughter of <HI>Leontes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paulina,</HI> overjoyed at this happy Discovery, invites the two Kings, with the Prince and Princess, to her House to see a Statue of <HI>Her∣mione,</HI> which she says is just finished, they follow her, and she shews them <HI>Hermione</HI> her∣self, who they supposed dead, standing upon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pedestal; after they have gazed on her some Time, still thinking it was a Statue of the de∣ceased Queen, <HI>Paulina</HI> orders the Music to play, and bids the Statue descend, which it does, and is discovered to be the living <HI>Hermione.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leontes</HI> receives her again with Transport Prince <HI>Florizel</HI> is married to his beloved <HI>Perdita</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
and the good old <HI>Paulina</HI> is rewarded with a∣nother Husband, in the Room of her lost <HI>Antigonous.</HI></P>
<P>It has been mentioned as a great Praise to <HI>Shakespear</HI> that the old paltry Story of <HI>Dorastus</HI> and <HI>Fawnia</HI> served him for a Winter's Tale, but if we compare the Conduct of the Inci∣dents in the Play with the paltry Story on which it is founded, we shall find the Original much less absurd and ridiculous.</P>
<P>If <HI>Shakespear</HI> had even improved the Story, and cleared it of great Part of its Inconsisten∣cies, yet he would still have been accountable for what remained, for why indeed did he chuse a Subject so faulty for the Story of a Play; his Claim to Praise would have been but very small, by making what was bad bet∣ter, since he was free in the Choice of his Subject; but certainly he can have no Preten∣sions to it at all by changing bad to worse; that he has done so will be easily proved by ex∣amining some of the principal Incidents, as they are differently managed by the Novelist and the Poet.</P>
<P>The King's Jealousy is the Foundation of all the Adventures that followed, but extra∣vagant as its Consequences are in both, yet the Rise and Progress of this terrible Passion is better accounted for in the Novel than the Play: In the first we are told that <HI>Pandosto,</HI> charmed with the friendly Visit <HI>Egistus</HI> paid him in his Dominions, desired the Queen to
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
treat her royal Guest with, the Respect and Esteem that was due to his Merit and the Friendship he had for him; the Queen, like an obedient Wife, complies with her Hus∣band's Directions, and perhaps over-acts her Part. The King begins to think he has been too officious; the innocent Familiarity be∣tween his Wife and Friend creates Suspicions, which meeting with a Mind prepared by a natural Distrustfulness to receive them, pro∣duces those Sparks of Jealousy which his in∣terested Observations on all their Looks, Words, and Actions, afterwards blew into a Flame.</P>
<P>This Account of the King's Jealousy does not absolutely clash with Probability. But let us see how <HI>Shakespear</HI> manages it in the Play; the two Kings make their first Ap∣pearance in the second Scene in high Friend∣ship and Confidence; <HI>Polixenes</HI> reminding his Friend of the Length of his Visit, tells him he is now resolved to be gone.</P>
<P><HI>Leontes,</HI> not able to part with him, presses him earnestly to stay longer, <HI>Polixenes</HI> urges the Necessity of his speedy Departure, and truly, as he observes, nine Months is a great while for a good King to be out of his own Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>Leontes,</HI> after many fruitless Intreaties, re∣proaches his Queen for not endeavouring to detain <HI>Polixenes,</HI> she, in obedience to his Com∣mands, presses him to gratify her Lord by a
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
little longer Stay; <HI>Polixenes</HI> complies at her Request, and certainly he must be a very ill bred Monarch had he done otherwise.</P>
<P>All this Conversation passes in the Presence of <HI>Leontes,</HI> who from hence takes Occasion to be jealous, and passes in an Instant from the greatest Confidence, Security, and Friend∣ship imaginable, to the last Extremity of Jea∣lousy and Rage. What wonderful Contriv∣ance is here? The Legerdemain, who shews you a Tree that buds Blossoms and bears ripe Fruit in the Space of five Minutes, does not put so great a Cheat on the Senses, as <HI>Shakes∣pear</HI> does on the Understanding; for this Jealousy of one Minute's Growth we see take Root before our Eyes, and so far from there being the smallest Progression in the several Actions of budding, blossoming, and bear∣ing ripe Fruit, that we have the first and the last at one and the same Instant.</P>
<P>The extravagant Effects of the King's Rage and Jealousy are carried far enough in all Conscience in the Novel, and <HI>Shakespear</HI> is not a Whit more moderate; only he has altered a Circumstance which entirely destroys the lit∣tle Probability the Novelist had preserved in the Relation.</P>
<P>In the Story, the King being in his own Mind firmly persuaded of the Queen's Guilt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rders her to be imprisoned, and the Daughter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at she was delivered of in Prison to be burnt; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Intreaties of his Courtiers he reverses
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
the Sentence past on the Child, and com∣mands it to be exposed in a Boat, but declares that his Queen shall die.</P>
<P>She insists upon being confronted with her Accusers, whereupon she is brought to a Tryal; but finding she was likely to meet with no Jus∣tice in a Court over-ruled by the Power of her Husband, she on her Knees protests her In∣nocence, and intreats the King to consult the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> concerning the Crimes of which she was accused. This so reasonable a Request being made in open Court, the King could not refuse it, and therefore sends Am∣bassadors to <HI>Delphos;</HI> who return with the An∣swer of the God; which being read, declares her Innocence, and the King is satisfied.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> makes the King in the Heighth of his Frenzy of Jealousy send himself to the Oracle of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and in the mean Time com∣mit the most barbarous Cruelties on his Queen and Child. How inconsistent is this! why does he consult the Oracle if he is resolved to proceed to Extremities before the Answer ar∣rives? The Request comes very naturally from the Queen in the Novel, and the King's Compliance with it is very well accounted for, but in the Play nothing can be more absurd than that the King should be reasonable enough to consult voluntarily the Gods concerning the Infidelity of his Wife; and while the An∣swer was expected, and her Guilt yet doubt∣ful, punish her with as much Rigour as if the Oracle had declared her an Adultress. Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
again the paltry Story has the Advantage of the Play. Let us go on to examine a few more of the Incidents.</P>
<P>In the Novel, the Persons who perform the hateful Office of exposing the Infant Princess are some of the King's Guards.</P>
<P>In the Play, it is a Nobleman of high Rank, who had Courage enough to reprove the King for his violent and unjust Jealousy, yet basely submits to take an Oath to perform his Commands, though he had Reason to think they would not be very mild, and still more basely keeps that Oath, though it enjoins him to carry the innocent Babe to a Desert, and there leave it to the Mercy of the wild Beasts.</P>
<P>In the Novel, the Accidents that happen to the exposed Infant are governed by Chance; the Boat into which it was put being left in the midst of the Ocean, is driven by the Winds to the Coast of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and being spied by a Shepherd is drawn to Land.</P>
<P>In the Play, <HI>Antigonous,</HI> who is bound by Oath to leave the Child in some desert Place quite out of its Father's Dominions, is warn∣ed in a Dream by its unhappy Mother to call the Infant <HI>Perdita,</HI> and carry it to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and there leave it.</P>
<P><HI>Antigonous</HI> obeys, and this done, it is abso∣lutely necessary he should never return to <HI>Sicily,</HI> otherwise it may be discovered where the Princess is left, and all the future Adven∣tures would fall to the Ground, therefore a Bear rushes out of the Woods and devours
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
him; the good-natured Bear, as it should seem, resolved not to spoil the Story, passes by the little Princess, who is to make so great a Fi∣gure hereafter, and a convenient Storm arising, splits the Ship in which she was brought thither, so that all the Sailors perishing, though they were near enough the Shore to have sav∣ed themselves, no one is left to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry back any Account of the Affair to <HI>Sicily,</HI> and thereby prevent the Adventures which are to follow.</P>
<P>All this is very wonderful: <HI>Shakespear</HI> mul∣tiplies Miracle upon Miracle to bring about the same Events in the Play, which Chance, with much more Propriety, performs in the Novel.</P>
<P>The Loves of the young Prince of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and the royal Shepherdess are carried on much in the same Manner by the Poet as the No∣velist; <HI>Shakespear</HI> has even borrowed some of the Thoughts from the latter in this Speech of <HI>Florizel</HI> to <HI>Perdita.</HI></P>
<Q><L>The Gods themselves,</L>
<L>Humbling their Deities to Love, have taken</L>
<L>The Shapes of Beasts upon them. <HI>Jupiter</HI></L>
<L>Became a Bull, and bellow'd the Green. <HI>Neptune</HI></L>
<L>A Ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd God,</L>
<L>Golden <HI>Apollo,</HI> a poor humble Swain,</L>
<L>As I seem now. Their Transformations</L>
<L>Were never for a Piece of Beauty rarer,</L>
<L>Nor in a Way so chaste. Since my Desires</L>
<L>Run not before my Honour, nor my Lusts</L>
<L>Burn hotter than my Faith.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="81" REF="82"/><HI>Dorastus</HI> speaks almost the same Words in the Novel, "The Gods themselves have not disdained to love: <HI>Jupiter</HI> was enamoured of <HI>Danaë,</HI> and the bright <HI>Apollo</HI> woo'd the inex∣orable <HI>Daphne;</HI> these were mortal Beauties, and they were Deities; why then, though a Prince, may not I love a Shepherdess, but their Passions were dishonourable, mine is pure and chaste, 'tis true, and herein I surpass the Gods; be still then, O my Soul, for 'tis decreed, <HI>Fawnia,</HI> the adorable <HI>Fawnia,</HI> shall be mine."</P>
<P>The Escape of the two Lovers is very dif∣ferently managed in the Novel and Play; in the first, the Prince being pressed by his Fa∣ther to marry, resolves to leave <HI>Sicily</HI> with <HI>Fawnia,</HI> and fly into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he intend∣ed to live concealed till his Father's Death, or that he could reconcile him to his Marriage with the beautiful Shepherdess; having pro∣cured a Ship, and a sufficient Quantity of Money and Jewels, he meets <HI>Fawnia</HI> early in the Morning and carries her to the Port, they embark, and steer their Course for <HI>Italy,</HI> but are driven by contrary Winds to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> where they are obliged to land.</P>
<P>In the Play, <HI>Florizel</HI> disguised in the Habit of a Shepherd for the Sake of <HI>Perdita,</HI> as∣sists at a Sheepshearing Feast. The King, his Father, being informed of his Son's Resort to the House of a Shepherd, goes there dis∣guised with his Confidant, <HI>Camillo,</HI> and comes
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
very opportunely to hear the Prince, his Son declare his Passion for the Fair Shepherdess pub∣licly, and his Intentions of marrying her; nay he carries his Indiscretion so far as to join Hands with her before all the Country People who are present; can any Thing be more absurd?</P>
<P>The King, sufficiently informed of his Son's Designs, discovers himself, and forbids the Bans: this is indeed a terrible Stroke; one would be puzzled to think how the Lovers will escape; for is it not natural to suppose that the enraged King will keep his Son in a strict Con∣finement to prevent this unequal Match; but it happens quite otherwise; for the King, after some severe Menaces, goes back to his Palace, and leaves his Son at Liberty to run away with the Country Girl, which he accordingly does.</P>
<P>The Part <HI>Camillo</HI> acts in this Affair is not more consistent; he longs to see again his old Master <HI>Leontes</HI> and his native Country <HI>Si∣cilia,</HI> which he had quitted to preserve <HI>Po∣lixenes,</HI> and because this Monarch loved him so well that he could not bear his Absence, and gently denied him Permission to go, <HI>Camillo</HI> betrays the Confidence he reposed in him, con∣sents to the Prince's Flight, and advises him to take Refuge in <HI>Sicilia,</HI> in Hopes that <HI>Polixenes,</HI> to whom he intended to discover where the Prince was gone, would follow him, and thus he might again return to his own Country.</P>
<P>This double Treachery and self-interested Views are very inconsistent with the Character
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
of so honest a Man as <HI>Camillo</HI> is represented to be; besides the Contrivance is absolutely ridi∣culous; for what Reason had the Prince to sup∣pose that <HI>Leontes,</HI> who passionately desired to be reconciled to the King his Father, whom he had so greatly injured, would offend him anew by protecting his Son, who had fled from him in order to marry a poor Shepherdess, for he could not expect the Story, however he disguised it, would be long concealed from him; and why should <HI>Camillo</HI> suppose that <HI>Polixenes,</HI> when he was informed of his Son's Flight, would quit his Dominions to follow him, and put his Person again in the Power of a King who had once designed to murder him: was it not more likely that he would send Ambassa∣dors to demand the Prince of <HI>Leontes,</HI> who would then have an Opportunity of shewing if his Penitence was sincere by sending him back again; but <HI>Shakespear</HI> has fallen into all these Absurdities in order to bring the chief Characters in his Play together at <HI>Sicilia,</HI> tho' for some of them there was not the least Oc∣casion.</P>
<P>The several Incidents that lead to the Dis∣covery of <HI>Fawnia</HI> are conducted with some Shadow of Probability in the Novel, but are much the worse for <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Alterations.</P>
<P>In the Novel <HI>Capnio,</HI> the Prince's Confi∣dant, as he is hastening after him to the Port, meets the Father of <HI>Fawnia</HI> going to Court,
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
and suspecting his Design, he artfully persuades him to follow him, and, partly by Stratagem, and partly by Force, carries him on board the Vessel in which the Prince and <HI>Fawnia</HI> were embarked; the old Man had taken with him when he left his House the Chain and Jewels he found with <HI>Fawnia</HI> in order to shew them to the King and relate the Manner in which he found her; but being prevented in this De∣sign by <HI>Capnio,</HI> who obliged him to be the Com∣panion of their Flight, he very prudently con∣tinues to conceal from <HI>Fawnia</HI> the Circum∣stance of her Birth; and, to secure to himself a respectful Treatment from the Prince and her, suffers her still to believe him her Father; but when at <HI>Bohemia</HI> the King of <HI>Sicilia</HI>'s Am∣bassadors discover who they are, and the old Shepherd and <HI>Fawnia</HI> are by the King of <HI>Bo∣hemia</HI> ordered to be put to Death for deluding the Prince of <HI>Sicily,</HI> he then declares that <HI>Faw∣nia</HI> is not his Daughter, and produces the Chain and Jewels he found with her as Proofs that her Birth was not mean; the King at the Sight of these Tokens knows and acknow∣ledges his Daughter.</P>
<P>Thus these Circumstances are altered by <HI>Shakespear.</HI>—The Prince having changed Cloaths with a cheating Pedlar, escapes with his Mistress to the Ship; the Pedlar imme∣diately over-hears a Conversation between the reputed Father of <HI>Perdita</HI> and his Son, in which it is resolved that he shall carry the Jewels to the King and declare how he found <HI>Perdita;</HI> the Pedlar supposing it would be an
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
Advantage to the Prince to know this, decoys the old Shepherd and his Son aboard; now one would imagine that all must come out; but see what strange Accidents conspire to hinder it.</P>
<P>The Pedlar, though he over-heard the old Shepherd say that <HI>Perdita</HI> was a Foundling and not his Daughter, neglects to tell the Prince this important Circumstance, though it was with that very Design he came and forced the two Clowns along with him.</P>
<P><HI>Perdita,</HI> though her Father and Brother are in the same Vessel with her, never sees or speaks to them: the old Shepherd and his Son make no Attempts to speak to her; and the Prince has so little Consideration for the Fa∣ther and Brother of his Beloved that he takes no Notice of them; how wonderful is all this! the most unlikely Things imaginable fall out to postpone the Discovery of <HI>Perdita</HI> till their Arrival at <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>The Novel makes the Wife of the jealous King die through Affliction for the Loss of her Son; <HI>Shakespear</HI> seems to have preserved her alive for the sake of her representing her own Statue in the last Scene; a mean and absurd Contrivance; for how can it be imagined that <HI>Hermione,</HI> a virtuous and affectionate Wife, would conceal herself during sixteen Years in a solitary House, though she was sensible that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er repentant Husband was all that Time con∣suming
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
away with Grief and Remorse for her Death; and what Reason could she have for chusing to live in such a miserable Confinement, when she might have been happy in the Pos∣session of her Husband's Affection and have shared his Throne: how ridiculous also in a great Queen, on so interresting an Occasion, to submit to such Buffoonery as standing on a Pedestal, motionless, her Eyes fixed, and at last to be conjured down by this magical Com∣mand of <HI>Paulina.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Music, awake her; strike;</L>
<L>'Tis Time, descend; be Stone no more; ap∣proach;</L>
<L>Strike all that look upon with Marvel; Come</L>
<L>I'll fill your Grave; up stir; nay, come away;</L>
<L>Bequeath to Death your Numbness, for from him</L>
<L>Dear Life redeems you.</L></Q>
<P>After this solemn Incantation, her Majesty comes down from the Pedestal and embraces her Husband, and her new found Daughter, for whose Sake she declares she had preserved her Life.</P>
<P>To bring about this Scene, ridiculous as it is, <HI>Shakespear</HI> has been guilty of many Ab∣surdities, which would be too tedious to men∣tion, and which are too glaring to escape the Observation of the most careless Reader.</P>
<P>The Novel has nothing in it half so low and improbable as this Contrivance of the
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
Statue; and indeed wherever <HI>Shakespear</HI> has altered or invented, his <HI>Winter</HI>'s <HI>Tale</HI> is great∣ly inferior to the old paltry Story that furnish∣ed him with the Subject of it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer,</HI> in his Edition of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> has this Note at the Beginning of the <HI>Winter Tale.</HI></P>
<P>This Country, here called <HI>Bithynia,</HI> hath in all former Editions been printed <HI>Bohemia,</HI> an inland Kingdom, situated nearly in the Center of <HI>Europe</HI>; whereas many of the great Incidents of the Play turn upon its be∣ing a maritime Country, of which <HI>Polixenes</HI> was the King. This is a Blunder and an Ab∣surdity, of which <HI>Shakespear</HI> in Justice ought not to be thought capable, and as he hath turned quite anew the Story contained in the old paltry Book of <HI>Dorastus</HI> and <HI>Fawnia,</HI> changing most of the main Circumstances, and all the Names of the Persons; it is pro∣bable he removed this Impropriety, and plac∣ed the Scene in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> which the Ignorance and Negligence of the first Transcribers, or Printers, might corrupt and bring back again to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by a less Variation in the Letters than they have been guilty of in numberless other Places of this Work.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear,</HI> in his Two Gentlemen of <HI>Verona,</HI> makes <HI>Protheus</HI> travel from <HI>Verona</HI> to <HI>Milan</HI> by Sea. Yet both those Cities are in∣land, and both more than eighty Miles distant from the Sea. Unless this Blunder can be also charged upon the Transcribers, or Printers, 'tis reasonable to suppose that <HI>Shakespear,</HI> who was guilty of the one, might be so of the other.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>I Begin, Gentlemen, with telling you that I wish you all as well as myself; here is a Comedy of <HI>Plautus</HI> which I bring you, and intreat you will give it a favourable At∣tention; listen now to the Subject of the Play, and be silent, I shall endeavour to comprise it in as few Words as possible.</P>
<P>'Tis customary with Poets in their Come∣dies to make one believe that all passes at <HI>Athens,</HI> to the End that the Subject may ap∣pear entirely <HI>Grecian,</HI> and may be more esteemed by the Spectators; as for me I shall not pretend to say that what we are going to represent here to Day happened in any other Place than where it really did.</P>
<P>The Subject of this Piece is truly <HI>Grecian,</HI> yet notwithstanding that it is not <HI>Attick,</HI> but <HI>Sicilian,</HI> and what I have hitherto said is only the Introduction to it.</P>
<P>In explaining the Argument to you I shall not amuse myself with shewing you Patterns only, but present you with the whole Piece, for it is my Intention to be very full in the Exposition of this Intrigue.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="92"/>There was formerly at <HI>Syracuse</HI> a good plain simple Man, a Merchant by Profession, his Wife was delivered of two Sons at one Birth, who so perfectly resembled each other, that the Nurse who suckled them, and the Mother who bore them were not able to distinguish the one from the other. This I was told by a Person who saw them; for my own Part I ne∣ver did see them, and I tell you so that you may not be deceived.</P>
<P>When these two Children arrived to the Age of seven Years, their Father took one of them with him on board a Vessel which he had loaded with Merchandize, and carried him to <HI>Tarentum,</HI> whither he went to trade, leav∣ing the other at home with his Mother.</P>
<P>It happened that when they arrived at <HI>Ta∣rentum</HI> they were celebrating Games, which, as it is usual with public Spectacles, drew to∣gether great Numbers of People.</P>
<P>The little Boy straying from his Father was taken up by a Merchant of <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> who carried him into his own Country; the Fa∣ther's Affliction for the Loss of his Son was so great that it deprived him of his Senses, and a few Days after of his Life.</P>
<P>This News being carried to <HI>Syracuse,</HI> the Grandfather of the two Children understand∣ing that one of them was taken away at <HI>Ta∣rentum,</HI> and that the Father was dead, changed the Name of his Grandson who remained with him, and gave him that of his Brother that was lost, whom he had loved extremely and was desirous of preserving the Remembrance
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
of; he called him therefore <HI>Menaechmus,</HI> a Name that was common to himself as well as to the Twins.</P>
<P>This Circumstance I remember very well, having heard it proclaimed by the public Criers; and that you may avoid Mistakes, I inform you beforehand, that these twin Bro∣thers have both the same Name.</P>
<P>But I must now return to <HI>Epidamnum:</HI> Is there any one among you who has Occasion for any Thing from that Country? If there be, he needs only to speak, and command me freely; however, he must understand, that it will be necessary to give me Money to enable me to perform his Commission; for to give me no Money would be a very great Folly, and to give me Money a still greater; I return then to the Place from whence I came; ne∣vertheless, I do not budge from this Spot.</P>
<P>This Merchant of <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> of whom I have spoken so much, and who took away one of the twin Brothers, had no Chil∣dren, but in every Thing else he was very rich; he adopted therefore the stolen Child; bred him up as his own Son; married him to a Woman with a large Fortune; and made a Will by which he left him his whole Estate: One Day, when he went into the Country, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t rained violently, and being obliged to pass a very rapid River, not far from the City, the Force of the Stream carried away this Ra∣visher
<PB N="94" REF="94"/>
of Children, and hurried him to the Fu∣ries in Spite of his Teeth.</P>
<P>Behold now the young Man established a <HI>Epidamnum</HI> in Possession of a great Fortune; his Brother brought up at <HI>Syracuse,</HI> is this Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arrived at <HI>Epidamnum</HI> with his Servant it Search of this other Brother; for this Rea∣son the City of <HI>Epidamnum</HI> will be the Scene of this Comedy; when we play another the Scene also shall be changed; for you know the Subjects are not always the same; some∣times we play a Merchant of Slaves, some∣times a young Debauchee, sometimes a poor Man, a Beggar, a King, a Parasite, or a Fortune-teller.</P>

Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Masters who load their fugitive Slaves with Chains, are in my Opinion guilty of great Folly; for a poor Wretch who sees a new Evil added to those he suffered before is but the more incited to commit new Rogueries, and to avoid Punishment by Flight; these Peo∣ple never fail of extricating themselves out of Difficulties: Sometimes they force open the
<PB N="96" REF="96"/>
Lock with a File; sometimes they break the Hinges of the Door with a Stone; all the Pre∣cautions one takes with them are useless; the best Way to prevent a Servant from flying, is to attach them to one's self by good Nourish∣ment; tye these Sort of Animals to a good Rack and give them Plenty of Provender, and take my Word for it they will not run away whatever Fault they have committed; they may be easily guarded if you make use of these Chains to retain them; the Ligaments of the Jaws are so pliant, that the more they are stretched the closer they may be drawn.</P>
<P>For a Proof of this I am going to the House of <HI>Menaechmus</HI> to get myself tyed in this Manner, and voluntary submit to a Sentence which has been long ago passed upon me; <HI>Menaechmus</HI> is a Man who not only feeds People well, but even gives them a new Birth and new Life; he is the first Man in the World for perform∣ing wonderful Cures; he is blest with a noble Appetite himself; you would say that each of his Repasts is a Feast; so well he knows how to furnish a Table; there is nothing to be seen on all Sides but Pyramids of Dishes, so that if one wants any Thing from the other End of the Table, one is obliged to raise one's self quite up from the Bed to reach it.</P>
<P>I have been many Days absent from him, dur∣ing which Time I have remained shut up at home with my dear little Family, for I cannot eat or drink any Thing that does not cost me very dear, therefore I am sometimes obliged to fast for Want of Money: I am now going to visit

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>IN my Opinion, my dear <HI>Messenion,</HI> these Sea-fearing Men know no greater Pleasure in the World than when after a long Voyage, they first discover Land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MESSENION.</SPEAKER>
<P>With Submission, Sir, I think the Pleasure is still more sensibly felt by those who after a te∣dious Absence from their own Country behold again the well known Port, and are ready to touch the Shore: But tell me, I beseech you, Sir, what are we come to do here at <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> are you resolved to imitate the Sea, and go round all the Islands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are come hither in Search of a Brother, a Twin Brother, whom I look upon as one half of myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="113" REF="113"/>
<SPEAKER>MESSENION.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you imagine will be the Issue of this Search, 'tis now six Years since we have wandered on the Sea in a vain Expectation of finding him; we have sailed round all <HI>Istria, Spain,</HI> the Country of the <HI>Massilia</HI> and <HI>Illyria,</HI> we have overrun all the <HI>Adriatic</HI> Sea, <HI>bar∣barous Greece,</HI> and all the Coasts of <HI>Italy</HI> that are washed by the Ocean? Had we been seeking for a Needle in a Bundle of Hay we should have found it by this Time, provided it was not invisible. In vain do we hope to find a dead Man amongst the Living, for if he were still in Being, shou'd we not have met with some one e'er now who cou'd have given some Intelligence of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am determin'd never to give over my Search till I have found my Brother, or met with some Person, who having known him, can certainly inform me that he is dead. This pining Anxiety will then be at an End, and I will return to <HI>Syracuse;</HI> but till I have that Satisfaction, while Life animates this Body I will not cease to wander about the World, and seek him every where; too sensibly do I feel the Force of fraternal Affection to quit easily the Hope of seeing my Brother again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MESSENION.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, you desire what can never possibly happen; in good Faith we wou'd do much better to return home, unless you design to write a History of the whole Earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="114" REF="114"/>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more of these satyrical Speeches, good Sir, but beware of drawing my Anger upon thee, and do not imagine thou can'st oblige me by thy Importunities to follow thy imper∣tinent Councils.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MESSENION.</SPEAKER>
<P>How well, Sir, do you remind me that I am a Slave, you have said a great deal in very few Words, nothing cou'd be more clearly exprest, nevertheless it cannot prevent me from telling you my Thoughts.</P>
<P>Vouchsafe, Sir, to favour me with a Mo∣ment's Attention. When I examine our Purse, when I count the Pieces that are in it, by my Faith, Sir, I find we have not suffici∣ent to maintain us much longer; 'tis light, very light by <HI>Hercules!</HI> Therefore if you do not make Haste home 'tis probable you may soon see it empty, and instead of finding your Brother, you will yourself fall into the Jaws of Necessity and Misery. For you must know, Sir, the People of <HI>Epidamnum</HI> practise but little the Virtue of Hospitality; they are a voluptuous Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple, and immoderately addicted to Drink∣ing. This City is full of Slanderers and Flat∣terers, Men without Justice and Probity; there are here also a great Number of Courte∣zans, who, as 'tis said, are the most alluring, and most dangerous of all that ever practised the Trade.

<P>DURING these thirty Years, which I have lived, I have never been guilty of so wicked, so unhappy an Action as this Day; my cruel Destiny led me into an Assembly, where, while I lost my Time in gaping and staring about me, <HI>Menaechmus</HI> escaped me. Ah! without Doubt he is gone to the House of his Mistress, and was not willing that I shou'd accompany him, and be a Witness of his Pleasures: May the Gods pour down their fiercest Wrath upon him who first introduced Assemblies, and thereby hindered People who have important Affairs upon their Hands from pursuing their Business. Assemblies ought only to be composed of indolent and idle Per∣sons, such ought to be summoned to appear, and when they don't obey, be punished by large Fines. A great many of the Inhabitants of this City eat always alone, and in private. Ci∣tizens, wholly useless to their Country, who
<PB N="136" REF="136"/>
have never performed the least Service to the Commonwealth, mean sordid Wretches, that invite no Person to their Table, and are never invited to others. Such as these ought regu∣larly to assist at Assemblies and public Meet∣ings.</P>
<P>If this excellent Order, this useful Custom had been observed, I shou'd not to Day have had the Misfortune of losing so plentiful and delicious a Repast, for I am as well assured that <HI>Menaechmus</HI> had once a Design to treat me this Day, as I am among the Number of the Liv∣ing. However I will go to him as late as it is, I have always Hopes of finding some Remains of the Feast; this Thought alone consoles me, and raises my depress'd Spirits; but is not that <HI>Menaechmus</HI> himself that I see? he is com∣ing out with a Crown of Flowers on his Head, ah! miserable that I am, the Feast is finish'd, they are risen from Table, by all the Furies!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a Custom here that is no less foolish than troublesome, and yet the wisest and best of us continue to observe it exactly, we are extremely desirous of having a great Number of Dependants, and of being perpetually soli∣cited
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
by Clients, but never give ourselves the Trouble to enquire whether they are good or bad; we never concern ourselves about their Probity, their Integrity, or the Merit of their Cause; all we desire to know is if they are rich. If the Client is poor, though his Behaviour be ever so unexceptionable, yet he passes for a Man who has very bad Principles; if he be rich, however wicked and base his Life and Manners, yet we extol him for a Man of great Virtue; there are some who regard nei∣ther Law or Equity, who are continually per∣secuting their Patrons, who deny to have re∣ceived what has been given them, and who having acquired large Fortunes by Usury and swearing falsely, delight in continually involv∣ing themselves and others in Lawsuits; when they have determined on a Day to have their Causes pleaded, they acquaint their Advocates or Patrons with it, and whatever Crimes they have committed, they must defend them whether the Cause be pleaded before the Peo∣ple, before the Pretor, or before the Judge.</P>
<P>A Client of this Sort has been the Cause of all my Mortification to Day; he disappointed me in all my Designs, and robb'd me of those Hours I had resolved to dedicate to Pleasure, I have pleaded for him before the Ediles, and after a great deal of wicked Disputation I of∣fered the adverse Party Conditions equally cruel and unjust, and mindful of my Disap∣pointment, went no farther in my Pleading than what was just necessary to form an En∣gagement
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
upon<NOTE N="§" PLACE="marg">The Pleaders on both Sides were obliged to lay down a certain Sum of Money, which each Party looked upon as the Reward of Victory, this Money was called a Fine, be∣cause it was the design'd Punishment of a Law-suit unjust∣ly undertaken.</NOTE>. Well what did my Client? Why he gave Security. I protest I never saw a Man so clearly, so manifestly convicted; the Crimes he was accused of were proved upon him by three Witnesses. May all the Gods punish him for the voluptuous Hours he has made me lose this Day! and may Heaven chas∣tise me also for my Folly, in going to the As∣sembly and depriving myself of a delicious Day.</P>
<P>I ordered a good Repast to be prepared, and I know my Mistress waits for me with great Impatience, I could not help this Delay, I left the Assembly as soon as possible, I do not doubt but <HI>Erotia</HI> will be extremely offended, but she will be appeased by reflecting on the fine Robe I stole from my Wife to present to her.</P>

<P>Then you know that I have not given away the Robe, I have only lent it for a little Time, upon Condition that when the Person

<P>By the Temple of <HI>Pollux</HI> I am in no Dan∣ger of such an Accident happening to me, for I have nothing to lose. May the Gods confound the Husband and Wife, both I say, what can I do now? I must even go to the public Square, and see if I can fasten upon any body who will give me a Meal, for I have nothing more to expect from this ingrateful Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So my better Half imagines she has mortifi∣ed me extremely by banishing me from home, Fool! as if I had not another Place to go to, where I shall pass my Time more agreeably than with a scolding Wife. If my Wife is offended I have the Consolation to think that my <HI>Erotia</HI> will receive me with open Arms; she will not banish me from her, no, she will welcome me with Transport—I will go to her immediately, and intreat her to give me back this cursed Robe which has occasioned so much Noise, and I will buy her a better. Hollo, who is there, what neither Porter nor Portress? open the Door, I say, and tell your Mistress I am here.</P>

<STAGE>The Old Man, Father-in-law of MENAECH∣MUS of <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> the Wife of the same, and MENAECHMUS SOSICLES.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am going to my Daughter's House as fast as my great Age will permit me, but well I know this Walk will be very difficult, for every Step is slower than the former, I sink under the Weight of Years, and drag a heavy Body, which my Limbs are hardly able to support; my Strength is almost gone, I carry my Years on my Back like bad Merchandize, for this wicked old Age, whenever it comes, brings with it a great many Followers, a Croud of Inconveniencies and natural Defects; in short, old Age is subject to so many Miseries that if I undertook to recount them I shou'd die before the Detail was ended. But besides the Pain of being old, which is not small, I am assaulted by a new Affliction that touches me sensibly; my Daughter has sent for me in a violent Hurry, she intreats that I will come immediately; what can be the occasion of this Message? what Accident has happened? my Imagination represents a thousand different Things to me, all equally tormenting.</P>
<P>But what I am most surprised at is, that my Daughter has sent only a general Message, which gives me no Light into the Affair. Ah! she wou'd have done better to have spared
<PB N="171" REF="171"/>
me this Anxiety by informing me exactly what the Business is. Mean Time I conjecture, I divine, and I am much deceived if I am not right, some new Family Storm, some domes∣tic Hurricane has occasioned this Message. Women who bring large Portions to their Husbands expect to make them wear the Yoke; these Women I say are generally very bad, and if the poor Husband endeavours but ever so little to maintain his Right of Superiority, the House will be always full of Noise; the Husbands indeed often abuse their Power, and then 'tis they who are in the wrong. To ren∣der the conjugal State happy, 'tis necessary that the Authority of the Husband ought to be exerted with Prudence; and the Submissi∣on of the Wife be bounded by Reason; by <HI>Pollux!</HI> it certainly is not for any trivial Mat∣ter that my Drughter has sent for me, 'tis something of Consequence, but whatever it is I shall know presently. Ha! do I not see this Couple before the Door of their House; the Husband has a discontented Air, his Un∣easiness is painted in his Countenance, how well have I guess'd! they are quarrelling, ah! I am seldom deceived. I must begin my In∣terposition by first speaking to the Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you, my Daughter? am I wel∣come? what good News have you for me? but you look sad, what is the Cause? why
<PB N="172" REF="172"/>
does your Husband look so angrily on you? you have certainly had a Battle between you, at least with your Tongues; tell me truly, Daughter, which of you two is most in Fault? and merits most the paternal Censure? tell me in few Words all I ought to be acquainted with, either as Judge or Mediator.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must first assure you, my dear Father, that I am guilty of no Fault; you may rely abso∣lutely upon this Testimony of my Innocence, though given by myself, but at the same Time, Father, I declare to you that it is impossible for me to live any longer here, I therefore conjure you to separate me from this Man, and take me home to you again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's this I hear! have you Reasons sufficient to induce you to make me this De∣mand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am slighted, I am despised, and am oblig∣ed to bear the most cruel, the most shocking Indignities.</P>

<P>Who is it that treats you so unworthily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That Man there, who promised you to love me and make me happpy, him who bears
<PB N="173" REF="173"/>
the Name of Husband to me, and oh! more wretched me, whose Wife I too certainly am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often have I warned you, my Daugh∣ter, to exert all your Prudence in avoiding Quarrels, that neither your Husband or you might have any Occasion to make me Com∣plaints.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can I obey you in this? my Fa∣ther, you suppose the Thing possible, but I swear to you solemnly it is not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Is it to me you address yourself?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, if you will have the Goodness to hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! how many Times have I recom∣mended it to you, Daughter, to conform to the Will of your Husband, you ought never to observe where he goes, or what he does, or endeavour to pry into his Diversions, or In∣trigues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he is in Love with a professed Courte∣zan, who lives in our Neighbourhood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="174" REF="174"/>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he so! faith I like him the better for it, and to reward you for your Diligence in dis∣covering this Intrigue, I will do my best to forward it, and engage your Spouse in new Gallantries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>But alas, Sir! his Debaucheries are not confined to Women alone, he drinks there to Excess, and buries himself in Voluptuousness in this infamous Brothel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it to you where he drinks? how far will you carry your Insolence? why do you not forbid him to go abroad, or to invite any Person to his Table? Do you expect that Husbands will relinquish their Authority, and take Pleasure in serving their Wives, and be∣coming Slaves to their unreasonable Wills; you might with equal Justice expect your Husband to sit amongst your Maids and spin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, Father! you did not come I find to be my Patron; my Message has procured a good Advocate for my Husband? you are here indeed at my Request, but you plead only against me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Husband is faulty, I declare myself against him, and I shall condemn him more
<PB N="175" REF="175"/>
severely than I have done you, from his Ad∣vocate I shall become his Accuser; but since I find that he supplies you with every Thing you want, and maintains you in Elegance and Splendor, in my Opinion, a Woman of Sense ought to be contented with these Proofs of Affection, and endeavour to merit them by Sweetness and Complacency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Father! I have only told you the slightest of his Faults—Wou'd you think it— This kind Husband opens my Cabinets, takes away my Cloaths, my Gold, my Jewels, to enrich and adorn his Whore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! if he does so he does very ill, but on the other Side, if this should be a Falshood, a Calumny, you are guilty of a most enor∣mous Crime, in thus aspersing the Innocence of your Spouse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can give you an immediate Proof of the Truth of what I say; at this Instant he has a Robe and Bracelet of mine about him; he had given them to his Mistress, but finding I had discovered his Baseness, he brought back his Booty apparently through Shame and Ne∣cessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will know from himself the bottom of this Affair, I will accost him, and give him Au∣dience
<PB N="176" REF="176"/>
in his Turn as a good and impartial Judge is obliged to do. Your Servant, Son-in-law, I wou'd fain know the Occasion of your Uneasiness, you seem to be angry with your Wife? what is the Subject of your Dispute, pray tell me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Man, whoever you are, I take <HI>Jupiter</HI> and all the Gods to witness—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon what Account? why do you thus invoke the Inhabitants of Heaven?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MENAECHMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I swear by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and all his Court, that I have not offered the least Injury whatever to this Woman here. She accuses me of no less than robbing her of a Robe, and this suppos'd Crime is so strongly impressed on her Imagina∣tion, that she is ready to swear I am guilty of it. But I beseech you, Sir, take Notice of what I am going to say, if ever I was within the House of this Lady, I wish I may become the most miserable of all Mortals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say, <HI>Menaechmus!</HI> are you mad? can any Thing be more extravagant than such a Wish? You swear you have never been within her House, and yet 'tis there that you dwell, surely this is a very wild and ridiculous Sally.</P>

<P>So they are gone, my Father-in-law and the Physician, and I am at last delivered from their Hands. Great <HI>Jupiter!</HI> what Adven∣ture is to follow those which have happened to me this Day? They declare publickly here that I am mad; it passes for certain, so there is the Reputation and Honour of my poor Brain dead and buried. But how can this be, for I am very sure that since my first Entrance into Life I have never been seiz'd with any
<PB N="193" REF="193"/>
Symptoms of this Distemper. Is this black Suspicion owing to Malice or Mistake? 'Tis strange! 'tis unaccountable! surely I am not mad. I neither insult, quarrel with, or strike any Persons that come in my way; my Mind is calm, my Thoughts are reasonable; my Behaviour is not different from other Peo∣ple; when I speak to them they reply, when they speak to me I answer them again, and with as much Judgment as ever I did before. 'Tis not I then that am mad, but those who reproach me with Madness have their own Brains cracked; People that labour under such Disorders, suspect others to be what they are themselves.</P>
<P>But this is not all that afflicts me, for how shall I dispose of myself at present? to which Side shall I turn? I dare not attempt to get into my own House, for my Lamb of a Wife will refuse me Entrance, and from my Mis∣tress nothing is to be expected; her Door is shut against me, no one will venture to in∣troduce me, we are upon such bad Terms with each other.—I have no other Resource but to wait here for the Approach of Night, my Wife perhaps may be then seiz'd with Compassion, and will permit me to take Part of her Bed.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE VIII.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MESSENION.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Merit of a good Slave consists in tak∣ing great Care of his Master's Substance, in laying it out wisely, in being attentive to his
<PB N="194" REF="194"/>
Interests; in short, a good Slave shou'd in his Master's Absence manage his Money in the same Manner as if he was present, or rather with more Circumspection.</P>
<P>A wise Domestic will always consider his Shoulders more than his Mouth, he will think it more necessary to provide for the Ease of his Legs than for the filling his Belly, and have the Reward he expects from his Master continually before his Eyes. But what is the Reward that a wicked idle Slave has Reason to hope for? in what Coin is he paid? why, with heavy Stripes, Fetters, grinding in Mills, cruel Fatigues, ravenous Hunger, and perishing Cold; these are the natural Con∣sequences of Disobedience and Guilt.</P>
<P>As for me, I am a declared Enemy to all these Things; there is not one of them con∣venient, not one that suits my Taste, or does not put me into a horrible Fear; 'tis for this Reason that I am firmly resolved to be good for something, and always prefer good Service to bad. I am not moved by harsh Language, or Reproaches, however unde∣served; for after all they are only Words, and Words strike nothing but the Air, but as for Blows, your humble Servant; I am not for them, I hate them mortally, the Impression they make, is a little too strong.</P>
<P>I must confess, also, that I eat much more willingly what the Labours of others supply me with, than my own; Bread made with Flower of my Grinding wou'd taste very bit∣ter,
<PB N="195" REF="195"/>
but it goes down very pleasantly, when done by the Fatigue of my Comrades. There∣fore I am always ready to obey my Master's Commands, I execute his Orders punctually, I serve him with Diligence and Alacrity, and I find myself in a very happy Situation, with these my servile Maxims.</P>
<P>Those Slaves, who because of their good Behaviour have nothing to fear, and yet are naturally timid, those Slaves, I say, are ge∣nerally most useful to their Masters; on the contrary, those who are bold, determined, and arrogant, are the greatest Tremblers in the World, when by their Faults they have drawn the Indignation of their Masters upon them.</P>
<P>Thanks to the Gods, I have no Reason to be afraid, my Master will in a little Time re∣ward me for my faithful Service; in the mean Time this is my governing Principle, to do always what is most for the Ease of my Back.</P>
<P>After having secured my Master's Servants and Baggage in the Inn, as he commanded me, I came back to wait his Orders, 'tis fit I knock at the Door, that he might be informed that I am here. Oh! that I may be so hap∣py as to see him come out safe and sound from this damn'd House; but I fear I am come too late, and that it will be after Death the Phy∣sician.</P>

<P>By <HI>Hercules,</HI> my Friend, I do not in the least doubt but that your Congratulation is

<P>What am I to think of all this? what wonderful Accidents have happened to me this Day! Some will not acknowledge me, but impudently maintain that I am what I am not, and from thence take Occasion to shut me out of my House; others pretend, not∣withstanding all my Assurances to the con∣trary, that I am their Master. The Man who has just left me, wou'd engage himself
<PB N="202" REF="202"/>
to all the Furies in Hell, that he is my Slave, and therefore I must give him Freedom; the Madman has promised me a Purse full of Money, if he keeps his Word I shall very chearfully take Leave of him, I will throw the Reins over his Neck, and suffer him to go where he pleases; for to be plain, I shall be afraid that when he is restor'd to his Senses he will remember the Money he has given me, and demand it back again, perhaps with Interest too: My Father-in-law and the Phy∣sician treat me like a Madman; from whence can it proceed? I am wrapt in Wonder at it. —Let me consider; am I awake, or is all this a Vision?—No, 'tis but too certain; what then shall I do? after so many Storms I be∣lieve I cannot do better than to go to this Courtezan, and by Prayers and Flatteries pre∣vail upon her to give me back the Robe; if I should have the Good-luck to succeed with this Woman, who like all the rest of her Trade is true to her own Interest, I will car∣ry it home immediately, and do not doubt but with such a Passport I shall gain Admit∣tance, and restore Peace again to my Fa∣mily.</P>

<P>Is it possible, Sir, that you can speak so contrary to your own Knowledge? certainly you mean to divert yourself, for you can∣not have forget the Service I did you just now. Did I not deliver you from four great Mastiffs, who were carrying you away by Force? You stormed, you cried aloud for Succour, and called both Gods and Men to witness the horrible Violence that you suf∣fered; in vain you struggled to free yourself from their Arms, I was destin'd to be your Deliverer; finding you in this Danger I ran, I flew to your Assistance, I fell furiously up∣on your Ravishers, and by a Shower of dread∣ful Blows I forced them to fly; thus I again made you Master of yourself, and restored you to Liberty. This Action, which shew'd my ardent Zeal for your Safety, moved your Heart; you thought, and with Reason, that you cou'd not reward so important a Service with less than Liberty, therefore you made me free.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the Use <HI>Shakespear</HI> has made of the <HI>Menaechmus</HI> of <HI>Plautus,</HI> in his <HI>Comedy of Errors.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>SHAKESPEAR</HI>'s <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> has been generally allowed to be founded on the <HI>Menaechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus.</HI> Mr. <HI>Langbain,</HI> in his Account of the Dramatic Poets, says that if it be not a just Translation of it, it is at least a Paraphrase, and in his Opinion far be∣yond a Translation, called <HI>Manaechmus,</HI> Print∣ed at <HI>London,</HI> 1593.</P>
<P>From this Translation of <HI>Plautus</HI>'s <HI>Me∣naechmi, Shakespear</HI> certainly borrowed his <HI>Comedy of Errors;</HI> but not being able to pro∣cure a Copy of it, and being wholly unac∣quainted with the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, I have turn∣ed Monsieur <HI>Gueudiville</HI>'s <HI>French</HI> Translation of the <HI>Menaechmi</HI> into <HI>English,</HI> which al∣though, as I am informed, it be not very li∣teral as to the Dialogue, yet the Plot, the In∣cidents, and Characters, being exactly the same with the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet's, it will serve to shew how much of the Plot <HI>Shakespear</HI> has borrowed in his <HI>Comedy of Errors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="219"/>That we may be the better able to trace him in his Imitations, it will be neces∣sary to examine the <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> Scene by Scene, and take the Story a little higher than the Commencement of the Action of the Play.</P>
<P>The Cities of <HI>Syracuse</HI> and <HI>Ephesus</HI> being at War with each other, a Law was made in both, by which it was provided, that if any <HI>Ephesian</HI> Merchant was seen to traffic in <HI>Syracuse,</HI> or any <HI>Syracusan</HI> Merchant in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> his Goods should be confiscated, and himself condemn∣ed to Death.</P>
<P>An old Merchant of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> named <HI>Aegeon,</HI> landing at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> is apprehended upon this Law.</P>
<P>Here the Action of the Play begins, as <HI>Aegeon</HI> is leading to Prison, the Duke of <HI>Ephesus</HI> meeting him, demands the Cause of his hav∣ing left his native Country, and coming to <HI>Ephesus; Aegeon</HI> thereupon gives a long Ac∣count of himself and his Family, which, in order to understand well the following Inci∣dents, I will transcribe.</P>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>Syracusa</HI> was I born, and wed</L>
<L>Unto a Woman, happy but for me,</L>
<L>And by me too, had not our Hap been bad:</L>
<L>With her I liv'd in Joy, our Wealth in∣creas'd,</L>

<PB N="221" REF="220"/>
<L>And he great Store of Goods at random leaving,</L>
<L>Drew me from kind Embracements of my Spouse;</L>
<L>From whom my Absence was not six Months old,</L>
<L>Before herself (almost at fainting under</L>
<L>The pleasing Punishment that Women bear)</L>
<L>Had made Provision for her following me,</L>
<L>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There she had not been long but she be∣came,</L>
<L>A joyful Mother of two goodly Sons;</L>
<L>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</L>
<L>As could not be distinguish'd but by Names.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That very Hour, and in the self-same Inn,</L>
<L>A poor mean Woman was deliver'd</L>
<L>Of such a Burthen, Male-Twins both alike:</L>
<L>Those (for their Parents were exceeding poor)</L>
<L>I bought, and brought up to attend my Sons.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Wife, not meanly proud of two such Boys,</L>
<L>Made daily Motions for our home Return:</L>
<L>Unwilling I agreed, alas! too soon!</L>
<L>We came aboard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A League from <HI>Epidamnum</HI> had we sail'd,</L>

<L>And this it was (for other Means were none)</L>
<L>The Sailors sought for Safety by our Boat,</L>
<L>And left the Ship then sinking-ripe to us;</L>
<L>My Wife, more careful for the elder born,</L>
<L>Had fasten'd him unto a small spare Mast,</L>
<L>Such as Sea-faring Men provide for Storms;</L>
<L>To him one of the other Twins was bound,</L>

<P><PB N="225" REF="224"/>Here ends the first Scene; the Appearance of <HI>Aegeon</HI> is of no other Use than to tell the Spectators several Circumstances antecedent to the Action of the Play, which it is necessary they should be acquainted with; this <HI>Plautus</HI> does in his Prologue.</P>
<P>The Story, though borrowed from <HI>Plautus,</HI> is yet very different; the Circumstance of two Brothers being so extremely like each other, that it was impossible to distinguish them, is highly improbable in the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> however doubles the Miracle, and presents us with two Pair of Twins in∣stead of one, with the same wonderful Re∣semblance.</P>
<P><HI>Plautus</HI> accounts very naturally for the Bro∣thers having both the same Name; the Grand∣father upon the Loss of the eldest, whom he loved best, to preserve the Remembrance of him, gives his Name to the youngest.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear,</HI> without assigning any Reason for it, makes the Twin Sons of <HI>Aegeon</HI> be both called <HI>Anthipholis,</HI> and the Twin Brothers, their Slaves, both <HI>Dromio.</HI></P>
<P>The Separation of the Husband and Wife, and their Children, from whence all the di∣verting Mistakes in the <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> arise, is brought about without the least Re∣gard to Probability.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="225"/><HI>Aegeon</HI> sails from <HI>Syracuse</HI> to <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> to settle his Affairs there, which were left in Confusion by the Death of his Factor, and his Wife, though near the Time of her Ly∣ing-in, follows him, for no Reason indeed but to be delivered at an Inn, where a poor Wo∣man, who like her, having born two Male Twins, she may buy them for Slaves to her own Sons; and that returning to <HI>Syracuse</HI> they may be shipwrecked, and separated from each other.</P>
<P>When the Storm arises the Merchant and his Wife, who, as it shou'd seem, have a View to the diverting Perplexities which are to fol∣low, fasten one <HI>Antipholis,</HI> and one <HI>Dromio</HI> together, so when the Ship splits they are very conveniently separated. Had they, like other fond Parents, been more sollicitous for the Preservation of their own Offspring than their little Slaves, and used their joint Endeavours for that Purpose only, the Father and Mother, and their Twin Sons, might have been all taken up together by the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Vessel, but thus equally dividing their Affection between their Children and their Slaves, and that ex∣cellent Contrivance of fastening a Twin of each Sort together, occasioned their falling into different Hands, and gave to each <HI>Anti∣pholis</HI> his <HI>Dromio,</HI> for the future Business of the Play.</P>
<P>The Mother and the elder <HI>Antipholis</HI> be∣ing separated, he and his little Slave <HI>Dromio</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="226"/>
are carried to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> where in Process of Time he is married to a rich Lady, and set∣tles there: Here the younger <HI>Antipholis</HI> comes to seek for his Brother, and his Father after∣wards for him; the old Man is immediately seized, and condemned to die, as has been mentioned, but the Duke respites him for the Space of one Day, in order to try if he can raise the Sum of one Thousand Marks to buy his Life.</P>
<P>In the second Scene <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> makes his Appearance with the Merchant of the City, who informing him of what had happened to the <HI>Syracusan</HI> Merchant, advises him to give out that he came from <HI>Epidam∣num.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> sends his Man, <HI>Dromio,</HI> with a Thousand Marks to lay up safe at his Inn, and being left to himself, de∣clares the Cause of his wandering about the World to be the Hopes of finding his Mother and Brother, whose Loss he deplores. While he is standing in the Street, <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> comes up to him, and taking him for his Master, tells him his Dinner is ready, and that his Wife waits for him.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis,</HI> deceived by the Resemblance, supposes this <HI>Dromio</HI> to be his Slave, reproves him for his ill timed Jests, and asks him where he had left his Money? <HI>Dromio</HI> talks of Six∣pence he had given him two or three Days ago.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="227"/><HI>Antipholis</HI> asks for his Thousand Marks? <HI>Dromio</HI> tells him of his Dinner, his House, his Wife, and presses him to come home. <HI>Antipholis</HI> at last, in a Fury, strikes him, <HI>Dro∣mio</HI> runs off, and <HI>Antipholis,</HI> full of Uneasi∣ness about his Money, returns to his Inn to look after it.</P>
<P>In the second Act the Scene is the House of <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> his Wife complains to her Sister of her Husband's long Stay, and wonders the Slave she sent for him is not re∣turned. <HI>Dromio</HI> then enters, and humorously repeats what had past between his supposed Master and him, declaring that he believes him to be mad, the Wife frets, and orders him to go back again and fetch him.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Scene changes again to the Street,</L>
<L><HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> enters, and informs the</L>
<L>Audience that his Money is safe, and adds,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"By Computation, and mine Host's Report</L>
<L>"I cou'd not speak with <HI>Dromio</HI> since at first</L>
<L>"I sent him from the Mart."</L>
</LG>
<P>Yet notwithstanding this Reflexion, the Moment his own Slave, <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> appears, he reproaches him with his having denied receiving his Gold, and with talking to him about his Wife, and a Dinner; and though the poor Fellow assures him that he never spoke such Words to him, and had not
<PB N="229" REF="228"/>
seen him since he sent him to the Inn till now, yet <HI>Antipholis</HI> falls into a Rage, and beats him.</P>
<P>A Dialogue of Puns and Quibbles ensues between the Master and Man, which is in∣terrupted by the Entrance of <HI>Adriana,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and her Sister.</P>
<P><HI>Adriana,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this <HI>Antipholis,</HI> and this <HI>Dromio,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> band and his Slave, re∣proaches him with his Neglect of her, and intreats him to come home to dinner.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis</HI> protests he does not know her, and that he is but just arrived at <HI>Ephesus</HI>; the Sister chides him, and tells him his Wife had sent for him home to Dinner by <HI>Dromio. Dromio</HI> is surprised, and denies it. <HI>Antipholis</HI>▪ who had had that Message delivered to him by the other <HI>Dromio,</HI> storms at the Slave for lying, the Fellow assures him he had never seen her. <HI>Antipholis</HI> asks how she could be acquainted with their Names if he had not seen her be∣fore, and informed her of them. <HI>Adriana</HI>; vexed at this Jesting, as she thinks it, intreats <HI>Antipholis</HI> to go home with her, and charges <HI>Dromio</HI> to keep the Gate for that Day, and let no one in to interrupt them.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis,</HI> though amazed to the last De∣gree at all this, resolves at last to</P>
<Q><PB N="230" REF="229"/>
<L>Say as they say, and persevere so,</L>
<L>"And in this Mist at all Adventures go.</L></Q>
<P>In the third Act, the Scene is the Street be∣fore the House of <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus. An∣tipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and his Slave <HI>Dromio,</HI> with a Merchant and a Goldsmith, whom <HI>An∣tipholis</HI> has invited to dine at his House enter.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis,</HI> fearing lest his Wife should be angry at his long Stay, desires the Jeweller to excuse it, by saying that he lingered at his House seeing the making of her Bracelet, and chides his Man for having dared to tell him he met him on the Mart, and charged him with a Thousand Marks in Gold, and with having denied his Wife and House. He then knocks at his Door, but is refused Entrance.</P>
<P><HI>Adriana,</HI> who supposes her Husband is dining with her above, is surprised at the Fel∣low below, who calls her Wife, and insists upon Admittance, and renews her Orders to <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> to keep the Door shut.</P>
<P>A smart Dialogue follows between the two <HI>Dromio</HI>'s, the one within Doors and the other without; the Husband and his Guests not be∣ing suffered to enter, he resolves to go and dine with a Courtezan at the <HI>Porcupine,</HI> and desires the Jeweller to bring the Gold Chain thither to him, that as he says, he may, to spight his Wife, bestow it upon the Courte∣zan, and accordingly they all go off.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="230"/>In the next Scene <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> makes Love to <HI>Luciana,</HI> Sister to <HI>Adriana,</HI> she upbraids him with his Falshood to his Wife; he swears he is not married to her Sister, and that he cannot be happy without her. <HI>Luciana</HI> threatens to acquaint his Wife with his Trea∣chery, and leaves him.</P>
<P>His Slave, <HI>Dromio,</HI> then enters, and <HI>Anti∣pholis,</HI> from the strange Accidents that had happened both to himself and his Slave, be∣lieving the Place inhabited by Witches, re∣solves to be gone immediately, and orders <HI>Dromio</HI> to go to the Harbour, and bring him Intelligence if any Bark was to sail that Night, telling him he will walk in the Mart till his Return.</P>
<P><HI>Dromio</HI> goes away to perform his Commis∣sion; and the same Moment the Jeweller, <HI>Angelo,</HI> enters with the Chain, and gives it to <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> whom he takes for the other.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis</HI> denies that he had ever ordered such a Chain to be made, but the Jeweller in∣sisting that he had, and telling him that he will call in the Evening at his House for the Money: <HI>Antipholis</HI> offers to pay him immedi∣ately, lest, as he says, he should never see the Chain or Money more, which the Jeweller refusing, and leaving him, <HI>Antipholis</HI> goes to the Mart to wait for <HI>Dromio,</HI> which ends the third Act.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="231"/>In the fourth Act a Merchant, to whom the Goldsmith, <HI>Angelo,</HI> owes a Sum of Mo∣ney, demands instant Payment, or threatens to arrest him by an Officer, whom he has with him. <HI>Angelo</HI> tells him <HI>Antipholis</HI> owed him just as much Money as he was indebted to him for a Gold Chain, which he had deli∣vered to him a Moment ago, and desired him to go with him to his House to receive the Money for it.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and his Slave, <HI>Dromio,</HI> enter, as from the House of the Courtezan, where they had dined. <HI>Antipholis</HI> orders <HI>Dromio</HI> to go and buy a Rope's-end, that he may chastise his Wife, he says, for locking him out of Doors, and that in the mean Time he will go to the Goldsmith; but seeing him, he reproaches him with not bringing the Chain as he had promised.</P>
<P><HI>Angelo</HI> desires him to pay the Money for the Chain to the Merchant there present, to whom he owes as much. <HI>Antipholis</HI> replies, that he has not so much Money about him, but bids the Jeweller take the Gentleman and Chain to his House, and his Wife would pay for it. <HI>Angelo</HI> says he gave him the Chain, and presses him to pay for it. <HI>Antipholis</HI> denies it. The Merchant, weary of this Altercation, ar∣rests the Jeweller, and he arrests <HI>Antipholis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> then enters, and taking <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> for his Master, tells him that a Ship is ready to sail, and that he had
<PB N="233" REF="232"/>
carried their Baggage on board as he com∣manded him. <HI>Antipholis</HI> calls him a Madman, and asks him for the Rope's-end, which he had sent him to buy: <HI>Dromio</HI> tells him he sent him to the Bay to see if any Bark was ready to sail, not for a Rope.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis,</HI> in a Passion, threatens him with future Punishment, and then orders him to go to <HI>Adriana,</HI> tell her he was arrested in the Street, and give her the Key of his Desk, and bid her send the Purse of Ducats that was in it to him. <HI>Dromio</HI> remembers that <HI>Adriana</HI> is the Lady with whom they had dined, and accordingly he goes thither, tells her what had happened, and she dispatches him away with the Gold.</P>
<P>The Scene then changes to the Street, <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> enters alone, and a Mo∣ment after <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> meets him, and gives him the Purse. <HI>Antipholis,</HI> full of Won∣der, questions his Man about it, and he talk∣ing enigmatically of Arrests and Durance, <HI>An∣tipholis</HI> thinks him distracted, and prays ear∣nestly to be delivered out of that City.</P>
<P>The Courtezan then enters, and seeing the Gold Chain about <HI>Antipholis</HI>'s Neck, whom she takes for <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> who had dined with her, she requires him to per∣form his Promise, and give her the Chain in∣stead of the Diamond Ring he had taken from her. <HI>Antipholis</HI> flies from her, and <HI>Dromio</HI> follows.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="233"/>The Courtezan, from this strange Behavi∣our, concluding him mad, resolves to go to his House, and tell <HI>Adriana</HI> that he had forci∣bly taken her Ring from her, hoping to re∣cover it again by this Means. She goes out, and <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> enters with the Jaylor, whom he had desired to accompany him to his own House for Money to release him. As they are going thither <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> returns with the Rope he had been sent to buy; his Master asks him for the Mo∣ney he went to fetch from <HI>Adriana. Dromio</HI> protests he had been sent not for Money, but for a Rope's-end. <HI>Antipholis,</HI> violently en∣raged, beats him, and whilst he is thus em∣ployed, his Wife, whom the Courtezan had alarmed with an Account of his being mad, enters with one <HI>Pinch,</HI> a Conjurer, whom she employed to cure her Husband of his Frenzy.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis</HI> growing furious at this Treat∣ment, his Wife calls for People to bind him, the Jaylor opposes it, he being his Prisoner, but upon <HI>Adriana</HI>'s promising to pay him, he suffers <HI>Antipholis</HI> to be carried off: And as <HI>Adriana</HI> is going out with the rest, <HI>Anti∣pholis</HI> and <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> enters with their Swords drawn, and they supposing him to be the <HI>Antipholis</HI> who they had just before sent away bound, crying out for Help, and <HI>Anti∣pholis</HI> and <HI>Dromio</HI> again set out for the Port.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="234"/>In the fifth Act the Scene is a Street before a Priory, the Jeweller, and Merchant who arrested him appear, and while they are dis∣coursing about <HI>Antipholis</HI>'s denying that he re∣ceived the Chain, <HI>Antipholis</HI> and <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> enter. <HI>Angelo,</HI> seeing him with the Chain about his Neck, reproaches him with having denied the Receipt of it, and refusing to pay for it. <HI>Antipholis</HI> protests he neither denied the one or the other; the Merchant hereupon taxes him with Fashood, <HI>Antipholis</HI> draws his Sword, and as the Merchant and he are fighting, <HI>Adriana</HI> enters, cries out that he is mad, and orders some People she had brought with her to bind both him and <HI>Dromio,</HI> and carry them home. <HI>Antipholis</HI> and <HI>Dromio</HI> to avoid this, take Shelter in the Monastery, and immediately the Lady Abbess appears, and demands the Cause of the others throng∣ing thither.</P>
<P><HI>Adriana</HI> tells her that her Husband, who ran into her House, is mad, and that she wants to have him fetched from thence, and carried home. The Abbess, after cunningly questioning her concerning her Behaviour to her Husband, and taking Advantage of her Answers, to prove that she had occasioned his Disorders, declares that she will not let him depart, but undertake the Cure herself.</P>
<P>The Duke that Moment, who is attend∣ing the Execution of old <HI>Aegeon,</HI> enters, and <HI>Adriana,</HI> throwing herself at his Feet, de∣mands
<PB N="236" REF="235"/>
Justice against the Abbess, whom she accuses of keeping her Husband from her, and recounts all the mad Actions he had been guilty of that Day. The Duke sends to bid the Lady Abbess come out and answer to this Accusation, and in the mean Time a Servant of <HI>Adriana</HI>'s enters, and tells her that his Master and <HI>Dromio,</HI> who had been left bound at home, had broken loose, and committed the most terrible Outrages on the Doctor and Servants at home, <HI>Adriana,</HI> who had seen him, as she thought, go into the Priory a few Minutes before, insists upon it that this Re∣port is false, when immediately <HI>Antipholis</HI> and <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> enter.</P>
<P><HI>Antipholis</HI> complains to the Duke of his Wife's having locked him out of Doors; she declares that he had dined with her that Day; <HI>Antipholis</HI> goes on to relate all that had hap∣pened to him. The Jeweller, the Merchant, the Courtezan, his Wife, and her Sister, hav∣ing been all deceived by the Resemblance of the two <HI>Antipholis</HI>'s, charge the one they are speaking to with all that had passed between them and the other; his occasions a great deal of Confusion and Perplexity. Old <HI>Aegeon,</HI> on seeing <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and taking him for his Son <HI>Antipholis,</HI> whom he had parted from seven Years before in the Port of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> tells the Duke that he has now found a Friend who will pay his Fine, and save his Life, and accordingly goes up to him, and naming him, asks him if he does not know his Father.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="236"/><HI>Antipholis</HI> protests he never saw him before; the old Man reminds him that it is seven Years since they parted at <HI>Syracuse,</HI> and deplores his own Misery in having been so soon for∣gotten by his own Son. <HI>Antipholis</HI> tells him he never saw his Father in his Life, nor was ever in <HI>Syracuse,</HI> which the Duke confirmed.</P>
<P>In the midst of this new Perplexity the Abbess enters with <HI>Antipholis</HI> and <HI>Dromio</HI> of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> all stand amazed at the exact Like∣ness of the two Gentlemen, and their Slaves; the Abbess spying <HI>Aegeon,</HI> owns herself to be <HI>Emilia,</HI> his Wife, the Mother of those two <HI>Antipholis</HI>'s and informs him that she and the elder <HI>Antipholis,</HI> with the Twin <HI>Dromio,</HI> were taken out of the Sea by Men of <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> but that some Fishermen of <HI>Corinth</HI> took away her Son and <HI>Dromio,</HI> and left her with the <HI>Epidamniens,</HI> that what became of them af∣terwards she never knew, but that herself ar∣rived to the Fortune of being Abbess of that Priory.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Antipholis</HI>'s being now discover∣ed, all the Mistakes which arose from their Resemblance are cleared up, <HI>Aegeon</HI> has his Life given him by the Duke, and they all go into the Priory to discourse more at large up∣on their several Fortunes.</P>
<P>The Unity of Time is exactly observed in the <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI>; the Incidents of this
<PB N="238" REF="237"/>
Play take up the Space of one Day like those of the <HI>Menaechmi;</HI> but the Action which in the last is single, and the most simple that can pos∣sibly be, is by <HI>Shakespear</HI> multiplied into se∣veral, some of which are far from being either probable or necessary. He has taken all the Characters in the <HI>Menaechmi,</HI> except <HI>Peniculus</HI> the Parasite, and the old Man, Father-in-law to <HI>Menaechmus</HI> of <HI>Epidamnum,</HI> and has added several others; every one of the Incidents he has likewise made Use of, but varied and ad∣ded Circumstances so freely, that his Play seems to be rather an Imitation, than, as <HI>Lang∣bain</HI> calls it, a Translation or Paraphrase of the <HI>Menaechmi.</HI></P>
<P>The Addition of the two <HI>Dromio</HI>'s increases the Business of the Play, but renders the Ob∣ject still more improbable, which is suffici∣ently so in the <HI>Menaechmi,</HI> where but half the Degree of Credulity is necessary to make it be relished.</P>
<P>The Mistakes which arise from the Resem∣blance of the Twins, are conducted with much less Art by <HI>Shakespear</HI> than <HI>Plautus.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet all appears the Effects of Chance, in <HI>Shakespear</HI> of Design; the Per∣sons in his Drama are hardly ever introduced with Propriety; they appear on the Stage, and go off again, evidently for no other Pur∣pose than to give Occasion for the Blunders which ensue.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="238"/>Thus <HI>Antipholis</HI> of <HI>Syracuse</HI> being resolved to leave <HI>Ephesus,</HI> sends <HI>Dromio</HI> to the Port to see if any Vessel is ready to sail, and bids him come to him to the Mart, where he will wait his Return, accordingly they separate, and it may now be reasonably supposed that <HI>Anti∣pholis</HI> is gone thither, but instead of that we find him a Scene or two afterwards standing in the same Place, where he is met either by the Wife, the Friends, or the Servants of the other <HI>Antipholis;</HI> and after having with great Difficulty disengaged himself from a∣bundance of perplexing Adventures, again he declares he is going to the Mart, and goes off for that Purpose, and again he is found in the same Place to give Rise to new ones.</P>
<P>In this Manner the whole Business of the <HI>Comedy of Errors</HI> is conducted. Those Errors do not as in the Play, which <HI>Shakespear</HI> bor∣rowed from, arise out of a natural and pro∣bable Succession of Incidents, but every Thing is put out of its Course to introduce them, and each Error is produced by an Absurdity.</P>

<HEAD>The Story of <HI>Amleth,</HI> translated from the <HI>Danish</HI> History of <HI>Saxo-Gram∣maticus.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Reign of <HI>Roderic, Hor∣wendil</HI> and <HI>Fengo,</HI> Sons of <HI>Gerwendil,</HI> had the Garrison of <HI>Jutland</HI> committed to them by the King. <HI>Horwendil</HI> was the bravest Pirate on the Sea, and for the Fame of his Exploits envied by <HI>Coller,</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who sailed in pursuit of his Rival; they met, they fought, and the King was slain.</P>
<P>The Encounter of these Heroes, with the extraordinary Manner of their Meeting each other alone in the Recesses of a Wood, with other Circumstances as improbable as any in Romance, are related in the true Stile of such Writings, by <HI>Saxo-Grammaticus,</HI> in the third Book of his <HI>Danish</HI> History.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="240"/>After the Death of <HI>Coller,</HI> and his Sister <HI>Selam, Horwendil,</HI> having for three Years given the greatest Proofs of Valour, destines his rich Spoils and choice Prey for <HI>Roderic,</HI> that he might rise in his Friendship. Grown fa∣miliar, he obtains his Daughter, <HI>Geruth,</HI> in Marriage, and by her had a Son, <HI>Amleth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fengo,</HI> fired with Envy at his Brother's Happiness, is resolved, by Treachery, to ruin him. So that Virtue is not always secure a∣gainst the Designs of such as are the nearest to, and the most intimate with us. For when an Opportunity offered to commit Fratricide, he with bloody Hand satiates the dire Lust of his Heart, poisoned with Envy; and enjoying the Wife of his murdered Brother, adds foul Incest to his Fratricide. He who submits to one Offence too readily offends again, for one Crime is often the Provocation to another.</P>
<P>He contrived this Villany with such Art and Impudence as to frame an Excuse for his Guilt from counterfeit Benevolence, and give to Fratricide the Colour of Love. <HI>Geruth</HI> was of so mild a Disposition as never to give the least Offence, and yet he said she had incurred the severest Hatred of her Husband, and that he had killed his Brother for her sake, and to save her, thinking it ungenerous so gentle a Lady, and without Gall, should endure the extream Moroseness of that Man.</P>
<P>His Success was equal to his Wishes, for Princes may be deceived, and made to believe
<PB N="243" REF="241"/>
Untruths in Courts where Buffoonery is some∣times favoured, and malicious Detraction ho∣noured. <HI>Fengo</HI> hesitated not with murderous Hands to embrace a Brother's Wife, and with equal Villany commits a double Impiety.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth</HI> sees this, but that he might not raise Suspicions in his Uncle by an over prudent Care for his own Safety, puts on the Guise of Folly, and feigns himself distracted, and by this Sort of Device he not only covers his Design, but saves himself. He lazily stretch∣ed himself out every Day before his Mother's Hearth, rolling on the Ground, and covering himself with Filth; his Face discoloured and besmeared with Gore and Nastiness, presented the ridiculous Extravagance of a Natural. Whatever he said was like the Ravings of a Madman; whatever Action he performed sa∣voured of extream Ignorance. In short, you would not say he was a Man, but a ridiculous Monster, produced by Fortune in a Frenzy.</P>
<P>Sometimes sitting by the Fire, and raking the Embers with his Hand, he would make wooden Hooks, and harden them in the Fire, and fasten the Ends within one another, that they might hold more firmly together; and when asked what he was about, would say he made sharp Spikes to revenge his Father.</P>
<P>He was not a little laughed at for this An∣swer. The Vanity of such a ridiculous Per∣formance was treated with Contempt by all,
<PB N="244" REF="242"/>
though it afterwards was of Use to him in the Prosecution of his Design.</P>
<P>This Ingenuity gave to those of better Judg∣ment the first Suspicion of his Subtilty. The latent Ability of the Workman for greater Matters was seen by his Skill in lesser ones. Nor could it be thought that his Senses were impaired, who by the Work of his Hands discovered such ingenious Artifice. Besides, he preserved his Heap of Brands that he had burnt at the Points to make them hard with the greatest Care.</P>
<P>There were those, who asserting that he was of uncommon Strength and Quickness of Parts, that he hid his good Sense under the Pretence of Folly, and covered the deep De∣sign of his Mind with crafty Invention, and that his Advice could not be more readily dis∣covered than by introducing to him at any Time in his Recesses a beautiful Woman, who might call forth his Mind to the Allure∣ments of Love.</P>
<P>So prone is Nature to the Passion of Love, that no Artifice can disguise it, and it is too violent to be interrupted by Policy. And therefore, if his Ignorance were counterfeit he would, when Occasion offered, yield Obe∣dience to the Power of Love.</P>
<P>Certain Companions therefore are employ∣ed, who should engage him to ride to distant
<PB N="245" REF="243"/>
Parts of the Forest, and try him with that Temptation.</P>
<P>Amongst them there happened to be a Youth, who had the same Nurse with <HI>Amleth,</HI> and still preserved in his Heart the Regard that naturally arises in those who are brought up together.</P>
<P>He preferring the Remembrance of former Fellowship to the present Charge, attends up∣on <HI>Amleth,</HI> with the rest of his appointed Comrades, with a Purpose to inform rather than betray him; which he could not doubt would happen at last if he discovered the least Sign of a sound Mind, and especially if he should openly indulge the Passion of Love.</P>
<P>Which was no Secret to <HI>Amleth</HI> himself; for when commanded to get on Horseback he purposely seats himself so as to turn his Back to the Horse's Head, and face his Tail, to which he began to apply the Bridle, as if he was by that Part to govern the Speed of his Horse. By means of this Contrivance he baffles the Design of his Uncle, and defeats his Arts. It was very ridiculous to see the Horse go forward without the usual Check of the Reins, the Rider directing only the Tail.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth</HI> in the Way met with a Wolf a∣mongst the Trees; his Companions saying they had met with a young Horse, he replied there were few such in <HI>Fengo</HI>'s Troops; by
<PB N="246" REF="244"/>
this modest and witty Prevarication he rallied the Riches of his Uncle.</P>
<P>When they added that he had made a sensi∣ble Answer; he affirmed that he intended that he might so to do, not in any Degree seem to favour a Falshood. For desiring to be thought incapable of lying, he blended Craft and Truth together that he might not seem entirely to de∣viate from Veracity in whatever he said, nor discover the Richness of his Parts by too much Exactness.</P>
<P>Passing along the Shore, when his Compa∣nions found the Rudder of a ship-wrecked Vessel, they said they had found a Knife of prodigious Size: It is therefore fit, says he, to cut up a large Ham, meaning the Sea in∣deed, to which the Size of the Rudder did well agree. Passing also by the sandy Clifts, and being directed to look upon the Beach, as if it were Corn, he said the same was ground by the foaming Billows of the Sea. This Answer being commended by his Attendant, be assured them it was discreetly said by him.</P>
<P>Being left by them on Purpose, that he might with greater Freedom indulge his Lust, in a private Place he meets a Girl, sent by his Uncle, as if it were by Chance, and would have lain with her, had not the Foster-bro∣ther warned him of the Snare by a secret kind of Information.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="245"/>For he, considering how he might best dis∣charge the Office of an unknown Monitor to his Friend, and prevent the Danger of his wanton Appetite, fixed a Straw he found on the Ground in the Tail of a Buzze, or Bee, flying by, and drove him towards the Place where he knew <HI>Amleth</HI> was. By this Act he conferred the greatest Benefit on the unguard∣ed Youth.</P>
<P>Nor was this Notice more cunningly con∣veyed than readily understood; for <HI>Amleth</HI> see∣ing the Fly, and the Straw that he carried in his Tail, and having carefully considered it to be a tacit Admonition to beware of Frauds: Alarmed therefore with the Suspicion of inju∣rious Designs against him, that he might more securely indulge his Wishes, he catch∣ing the Girl in his Arms, carries her a consi∣derable Distance into a Marsh, and unfre∣quented, and after Enjoyment earnestly in∣treats her not to declare it to any one.</P>
<P>With equal Concern therefore is Silence urged and obtained. For their being brought up together under the same Guardians from their Infancy, produced the greatest Famili∣arity between her and <HI>Amleth.</HI></P>
<P>Upon his Return home, being asked by every one whether he had gratified his Lust, he owned he had lain with the Girl. Being asked again in what Place he had done it, or what Pillow he had used, answered, The Hoof
<PB N="248" REF="246"/>
of an Animal that carries a Burthen, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Oestrus or Oestrum has a double Signification, either a Gad-bee as above, or a Coxcomb, as in this Place.</NOTE> the Comb of a Cock, and under an arched Roof. He had put all these Particulars, when under Trial, that he might avoid the telling a Lie. This Account excited much Laughter in those about him, although, for the Jest sake, he did not diminish any Thing of the Truth.</P>
<P>The Girl also being questioned (kept her Word with him) and declared he had done no∣thing. Credit is given her, and the rather, as it appeared that his Guards knew nothing of the matter. Then he who had marked the Buzze for a Token, to shew that the Safety of <HI>Amleth</HI> was owing to his Conceit, said that he was lately the only one who took Care of him, and that the young Man's An∣swer was to the Purpose.</P>
<P>Nor was the Merit of the Token forgot: he related how he saw the little Carrier of the Straw with hasty Flight passing near him, and that the Straw was stuck in the hinder Parts of his Body. As this Relation excited greater Laughter in the rest, the Friend of <HI>Amleth</HI> was no less delighted with his Pru∣dence.</P>
<P>All of them being defeated, and unable to gain Admittance into the Secrets of this young Man's Stratagems; one of the Friends of <HI>Fengo,</HI> more presumptuous than politic, deni∣ed
<PB N="249" REF="247"/>
that this unextricable Scheme of Subtilty could be unravelled by common Artifice; for he was too obstinate to be moved by Trials of little Moment: An ordinary manner of Trial would not reach such Variety of Craft. But he had discovered by superior Sagacity a more subtle Manner of trying him, not improper for Execution, but most effectual for the Dis∣covery of the Thing proposed.</P>
<P>The Scheme was this, "That <HI>Fengo</HI> should under the Pretence of Business of great Con∣sequence withdraw himself, and <HI>Amleth</HI> be shut up with his Mother alone in her Apartment, Care being taken to have a Man, who un∣known to either of them, should be placed in some secret Part of the Room unseen, to hear attentively whatever passed in Conversa∣tion between them. For if the Son was really in his Senses he would have no Difficul∣ty in speaking freely to a Mother's Ear, nor mistrust the Fidelity of her that bore him. And that he might not seem more forward to advise than ready to execute, he desired him∣self to be the Spy.</P>
<P><HI>Fengo</HI> approved the Scheme, and sets out with the Pretence of taking a long Journey.</P>
<P>Mean while the Projector having privately stole to the Chamber where <HI>Amleth</HI> and his Mother were, lay hid under the Matt of the Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="248"/>But <HI>Amleth</HI> was not the Dupe of this Trea∣chery. For suspecting that he might be over∣heard by some officious Listener, he has at first Recourse to his accustomed Folly, and imitates the crowing of a Cock, and flapping his Arms as if they were Wings, he jumps up and down upon the Bed to try if any Thing lay hid there. And when he found a Mass under his Feet he examined the Place with his Sword, and stabs the Man who was under∣neath, and dragging him forth put him to Death. Cutting the Body in Pieces, he boils them, and pours them out through the Sewer to be devoured by the Hogs.</P>
<P>And thus was the miserable Body rendered undistinguishable from the Dung of the Stye.</P>
<P>Having escaped this Snare, he returns to his Mother's Apartment, and when she with great Lamentation and Tears began to bemoan the want of Understanding in her Son now present, "Why; O! worst of Women, says he, dost thou endeavour to disguise the foulest Crime under a false Species of Wailing? Thou, who sporting with the Wantonness of a Strum∣pet, and yielding to the vile and impious Condition of your second Marriage, embrace in your incestuous Bosom the Murderer of your Husband, and fawn upon, and please with lewdest Transport the very Man who put to death the Father of your Offspring; so Mares are coupled with Horses that subdued their Foremates. It is for Beasts alone to be
<PB N="251" REF="249"/>
dragged to any, and to every Male. By this Example it appears that you have lost all Memory of your former Husband. It is not without Reason that I bear the Resemblance of a Fool; for I cannot doubt that he who could destroy a Brother would with like Cruelty rage against his other Kindred. It is safer to wear the Garb of Folly than of Sense, and I must borrow a Safeguard from the lowest Species of Madness. Yet the Care of revenging my Father is ever present to my Mind, but I wait for Times and Seasons. The same Place suits not with every Scene or Purpose against a dark and cruel Mind, much Thought is re∣quisite. But for you to lament my Madness is vain, when you ought rather to deplore your own Infamy; you should therefore not lament another's but your own Failing, for the rest be on your Guard and keep the strictest Silence. By such Reproach did he endeavour to recall his Heart-rent Mother to the Practice of for∣mer Habits of Virtue, and to teach her to prefer the former Flames of chaster Love to the present criminal Transports."</P>
<P><HI>Fengo</HI> returns, and of every one, and every where enquires for his injudicious Spy; but he is no more to be found, nor does any one re∣member to have seen him. <HI>Amleth,</HI> in jest, is asked whether he could discover any Tracts of him; and replies, "that he went in at the Sewer, fell to the Bostom, was kept down by the Mud, and devoured by the Hogs, who thronged to the Draught." Which Declara∣tion,
<PB N="252" REF="250"/>
though true, seeming idle and foolish, was treated as ridiculous.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fengo</HI> no longer doubted of the Sub∣tilty of his Son-in-law, he resolved to destroy him, but was afraid to execute his Purpose on account of his Grandfather, <HI>Roderic,</HI> and the Displeasure of his own Wife. To cover his Guilt by the Service of another, he purposes to have him destroyed by means of the King of <HI>Britain.</HI> Thus desirous of con∣cealing his Cruelty, he chuses rather to pol∣lute his Friend than to be thought infamous himself.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth,</HI> departing in secret, directs his Mother to furnish the Hall with Hangings well knotted together, and at the Expiration of a Year to report him dead, and celebrate his funeral Obsequies, and at that very time he promises to return.</P>
<P>He is attended by two of <HI>Fengo</HI>'s Officers, bearing Letters inscribed on Wood (for that was once a famous Manner of Writing) by which it was given in Charge to the King of <HI>Britain</HI> to destroy the young Man that was sent to him.</P>
<P>Whilst these Officers slept, <HI>Amleth</HI> examin∣ing their Baggage discovers these Tablets; having read them, he rubs out what was writ∣ten therein, and inserting other Characters, changes the Tenor of the Mandate from his own Destruction to the Death of his At∣tendants.
<PB N="253" REF="251"/>
Nor satisfied with this Alteration, whereby he saves his own Life and exposes that of his Guards, he adds, as the earnest Entreaty of <HI>Fengo,</HI> that the King of <HI>Britain</HI> would be∣stow his Daughter in Marriage upon that Youth he had sent him, who was most wise and prudent.</P>
<P>When they came to <HI>Britain</HI> the Envoys waited on the King, and presented the In∣strument for their own Destruction, though they thought it threatned not them but their Companion.</P>
<P>The King, taking no Notice to them of the Instructions delivered him, entertains them with great Magnificence and Hospitality, when <HI>Amleth,</HI> despising the Splendor of the royal Tables as if they contained but common Food, abstains in a surprising Manner from the richest Exhibition of Dainties, both in Meats and Drinks.</P>
<P>All admired that a Youth of foreign Ex∣tract should nauseate the choicest Dainties of the royal Board and most excellent Luxury, as if it were coarse and homely Fare.</P>
<P>The Banquet ended, the King dismissed his Friends that they might retire to Rest, but took Care, by one sent privately and hid in their Apartments, to be informed of the Con∣versation of his Guests. When <HI>Amleth</HI> be∣ing asked by his Comrades why he abstained from the Entertainment of Yesterday as from
<PB N="254" REF="252"/>
Poison? "replied that the Bread was sprinkled with the Contagion of Blood, that the Wine tasted of the Sword, that the animal Food savoured of the Corpse of a dead Man, and was as offensive as the Smell of a Sepulchre."</P>
<P>He added "that the King had mean Eyes, that the Queen in three Instances resembled a Servant;" railing not only at the Feast but at the Authors of it.</P>
<P>His Companions, upbraiding him with his former want of Understanding, began to abuse him for having found Fault with approv∣ed good Things, blamed what was proper, and slandered with indecent Language a great King, and a Queen of refined Manners, and treated with Disgrace and Indignity those who really deserved Applause.</P>
<P>Which Circumstances being related to the King by his Officer, he declared the Wisdom or Madness of him who had related such Things of more than mortal Growth in so few Words to shew such Extent of Know∣ledge. He sent for the Steward, and enquir∣ed of him where he had the Bread, and when he was told that it was made by the Baker to the Houshold, he asked again where the Corn grew, and if there was any Sign of human Slaughter in that Place?</P>
<P>He answered "that there was a Field not far off covered with the Bones of Men long since slain, yet manifestly exhibiting the Remains
<PB N="255" REF="253"/>
of ancient Slaughter, which he, with Expec∣tation of greater Plenty, as the richer Soil had sown with Spring Corn, and therefore he did not know whether the Bread might not have contracted a disagreeable Taste."</P>
<P>When the King heard this, believing <HI>Amleth</HI> had spoken Truth, he took Care to know whence the Bacon came.</P>
<P>The Man owned that the Swine, straying from his Care, had fed upon the Carcase of a Thief, and so perhaps the Meat might taste something like Corruption.</P>
<P>When the King found that his Opinion was true, demanded in this Instaece likewise with what Liquor he had mixed the Drink? as he knew it to be made of Corn and Water; the Situation of the Spring being shewn him he set about digging, and found many Swords eaten with Rust, from whence he supposed the Water had contracted that Smell.</P>
<P>Others said the Drink was found fault with because in the Draught he had met with Bees that had been bred in the Belly of a dead Man, and tasted of Comb. By which the King, seeing there was sufficient Reason to complain of the Taste of these Things, finding that he himself was reproached on account of his Eyes, and knowing that this must allude to Baseness of Birth, taking his Mother aside, de∣manded of her who was his Father, she de∣claring she knew no other than the King, by
<PB N="256" REF="254"/>
threatning her with Death unless she confessed; he discovered himself to be the Son of a Servant.</P>
<P>Thus by the extorted Confession he came to understand that his Origin, which had been reflected on, was at least ambiguous. He is confounded with Shame at this Discovery of his Condition, but no less charmed with the young Man's Wisdom; and asked him why he had reproachfully slurred the Queen as one of servile Manners? But whilst he laments that the gentle Disposition of his Wife was attack∣ed by the Discourse of his Guest in the Night, he learns that her Mother was a waiting Wo∣man; and whereas he said she exhibited three Defects of a servile Nature, they are these. One, "that she dressed her Head in the same Manner as Servants do, another, that she tucked up her Gown in walking, the third was, that she picked her Teeth with a Skewer, and eat the Pickings of them. He took No∣tice that her Mother was reduced to Servitude by becoming a Captive, so that she was not less servile in her Birth than her Manners."</P>
<P>Such Sagacity being reverenced by the King, as if it were divine, he gave him his Daughter in Marriage, and received his Affir∣mation of any Thing as if it bore the Testi∣mony of Heaven. But as for his Compani∣ons, that he might perform the Behest of his Friends, he hanged them up the next Day, which, though an Advantage, <HI>Amleth</HI> seemed to resent as an Injury, feigning a Distress of Mind, and received Money by way of Com∣position
<PB N="257" REF="255"/>
from the King; which he afterwards took Care secretly to melt down and pour in∣to hollow Staves.</P>
<P>Having stay'd with him a Year, he obtains Leave to depart, and returns home again, taking nothing out of the Magazine of royal Treasure but the hollow Staves, in which he had poured the Gold. When he arrived at <HI>Jutland,</HI> he resumed his old Behaviour, chang∣ing his late Elegance for the ridiculous Man∣ner he had before employed. And when he entered the Hall, covered with Nastiness, where the Funeral Rites were celebrated, he threw every body into great Amazement, be∣cause a false Report had been spread of his Death. At length their Astonishment was turned into Laughter, and the Guests rallied each other upon the Presence of him alive, to whom they had performed Honours as dead.</P>
<P>When questioned concerning his Compani∣ons, he said, shewing the Staves he held, "Here is both the one and the other;" which was said with equal Wit and Truth, for though it ap∣peared an unmeaning Speech to most who heard it, yet swerved not from his customary regard to Truth, shewing the Compensation instead of the Men that were executed.</P>
<P>Then mixing with the Waiters, that he might heighten the Mirth of the Table, he supplied them with Liquor with more than or∣dinary Diligence, and that his flowing Habit might not obstruct his moving up and down,
<PB N="258" REF="256"/>
he girt it round him with his Belt, and often with Design, drawing his Sword, he cut his Fingers with the Point; Care therefore was taken by those about him to fasten his Sword in the Scabbard with a Nail.</P>
<P>That he might the more securely effect his Purpose he charged the Nobility with Excess of Liquor, till all were overcame with Drink∣ing, and, unable to walk, were obliged to take up their Rest in the Hall, and sleep where they had been feasting. And when he observed them in a Condition fit for his Designs, be∣lieving the Execution of it was in his Power, he puts the Brands he had formerly prepared into his Bosom, and then re-entering the Hall where the Nobles lay stretched on the Ground, oppressed with Sleep and Surfeit, he let fall the Curtain his Mother had wove, by cut∣ting the Lines that held it round the sides of the Room, which he drew over them, and fastened with the Hooks in so artful a Manner, that not one of them, though he strove with never so much Strength, could possibly get up.</P>
<P>After this he sets fire to the Room, which spreading far and wide, soon set the whole House in a Blaze, destroyed the Palace, and burnt all, both those that continued asleep, and those who laboured to rise but in vain. Thence hasting to <HI>Fengo</HI>'s Apartment, who had been before conducted thither by his Attendants, he took his Sword that hung
<PB N="259" REF="257"/>
by his Bed, and put his own in its room; then rousing his Uncle, he told him that his Nobles were destroyed by Fire, that <HI>Amleth</HI> was there, and furnished with the Hooks he had formerly made, and was now present with him eager to inflict the Venge∣ance due for his Father's Death.</P>
<P>On hearing this, <HI>Fengo</HI> jumps from his Bed, and was murdered, while disappointed of his own he vainly endeavours to draw <HI>Amleth</HI>'s Sword. O! brave Man! and worthy everlast∣ing Renown, who, furnishing himself wisely with counterfeit Folly, covered more than human Wisdom under the Guise of a Na∣tural, not only secured his own Safety by that Artifice, but obtained the Means of compleatly revenging his Father, and having so done, it is left for every one to judge which was greater, his Bravery or Wisdom.</P>

<P><HI>Amleth</HI> returns home again with both his Wives; where he finds <HI>Viglet,</HI> the Successor of <HI>Roderic,</HI> who was dead. This new So∣vereign had stript his Mother of her royal Treasures, and denied the Right of her Son to <HI>Jutland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amleth</HI> at last is forced to engage him in un∣equal War, and is slain. And the fair <HI>Her∣mutruda,</HI> who had taken the Camp, and de∣termined to share his Fate, willingly yielded herself to the Conqueror's Arms. <HI>Viglet</HI> died in Years, and was succeeded by <HI>Wermund.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the Use <HI>Shakespear</HI> has made of the foregoing Story in his Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Fable of the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>CLAUDIUS,</HI> the reigning King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> having secretly murdered his Bro∣ther, in order to possess himself of his Throne afterwards, married his Widow; the Ghost of the deceased King appears to some Cen∣tinels, who were posted on the Platform before the Palace; these Soldiers tell <HI>Marcellus,</HI> their Officer, what they had seen, and he ac∣quainting <HI>Horatio,</HI> the Friend of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> Son to the deceased King, with it; these two Gen∣tlemen watch one Night on the Platform, with an Intention to speak to the Apparition if it should appear. The Ghost at the accustomed Hour appears. <HI>Horatio</HI> solemnly conjures it to speak, and unfold the Cause of its Appearance, but the Ghost continues silent and stalks away.</P>
<P><HI>Horatio</HI> thereupon resolves to tell <HI>Hamlet</HI> what had happened; the Prince, full of Grief
<PB N="262" REF="260"/>
for his Father's Death, displeased at his Mo∣ther's incestuous Marriage, and discontented with the Behaviour of his Uncle, immediately concludes from this Account of his Father's Spirit appearing that all was not well, and de∣clares to his two Friends that he will watch with them that Night on the Platform, and speak to the Spirit.</P>
<P>Accordingly at Midnight he meets them at the appointed Place, and the Ghost soon after appearing, <HI>Hamlet</HI> in a most earnest and af∣fecting Manner conjures it to speak, and ac∣quaint him with the Cause of its appearing. The Ghost beckens him to follow it; his Companions, apprehending some Danger might happen to his Person, endeavour to re∣tain him, hut in vain, <HI>Hamlet</HI> breaks from them and follows the Ghost, who bringing him to a remote Place declares that he is the Spirit of his Father, that he was poisoned in his Garden by his Brother, who lusted for his Wife and Crown; he then charges him to re∣venge his Murder, and vanishes.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> vows to fulfil his Commands, and to conceal the Grief and Indignation which prey upon his Heart, and his vowed Purpose of Revenge, counterfeits Madness; which alarm∣ing the guilty King, and troubling his Mother, they send for two of his School-fellows to a∣muse him, and engage him in Diversions to abate the Force of his Melancholy.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="261"/><HI>Polonius,</HI> an old Lord, very faithful to the King's Interests, and whose Daughter, <HI>Ophelia, Hamlet</HI> is in Love with; from her Report of a frantic Visit he made her, con∣cludes he is mad for her; she having, accord∣ing to his Orders, returned his Letters and Presents, and refused to hear his Professions as usual. <HI>Pollonius,</HI> having as he thought dis∣covered the Cause of <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Madness, ac∣quaints the King and Queen with his Suspici∣ons: <HI>Ophelia</HI> is designedly thrown in his way, while the King and <HI>Polonius</HI> conceal them∣seves to hear their Discourse.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet,</HI> after uttering a great many sensible Extravagancies, leaves <HI>Ophelia</HI> firmly con∣vinced of his Madness, which she affection∣ately deplores; but the King, who had heard all his Discourse, being persuaded that Love was not the Cause of his Melancholy, and that there might be Danger in it, resolves to send him to <HI>England</HI> to demand the Tribute, the Payment of the Tribute which had been long neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Polonius,</HI> to whom he communicates this Scheme, approves of it, but advises that the Queen should first send for him, and in a pri∣vate Conversation intreat him to discover the Cause of his Uneasiness.</P>
<P>The King consents, mean Time <HI>Hamlet</HI> having engaged some Players to represent a Piece something like the Murder of his Father,
<PB N="264" REF="262"/>
invites the King and Queen to the Play; and he doubting that the Spirit that appeared to him might be a lying Spirit, resoves to make the Play the Test of the King's Conscience; he therefore desires his Friend, <HI>Horatio,</HI> to join with him in carefully observing the King's Countenance during the Representation of one particular Scene, which resembles the Circumstance of his Father's Death, adding,
<Q><L>——If his occult Guilt</L>
<L>Do not itself unkennel in one Speech,</L>
<L>It it a damned Ghost that we have seen.</L></Q></P>
<P>Accordingly the King is so much struck with that Scene that he rises abruptly and goes out, by which <HI>Hamlet</HI> is convinced that the Ghost had told him nothing but Truth. The Queen then sends for <HI>Hamlet</HI> with an Intention to question him concerning his late Behaviour, and <HI>Polonius,</HI> with her Consent, conceals himself behind the Arras to hear their Discourse.</P>
<P>The Queen being frighted at her Son's rude Treatment of her, cries out for Help, <HI>Po∣lonius</HI> behind the Arras echoes her, and <HI>Hamlet,</HI> supposing it was the King who had concealed himself there, kills him.</P>
<P>After a severe Lecture to his Mother, he charges her not to discover that his Madness is feigned, declares that he suspects some Treason in the Embassy he is sent on to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="263"/>
yet resolves to go, and madly takes Leave of the King and her for that Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Ophelia,</HI> at the News of her Father's being murdered by <HI>Hamlet,</HI> grows distracted; her Brother, <HI>Laertes,</HI> fired by Rage and Grief, raises a Mutiny to revenge his Father. The King declares that he is innocent of his Fa∣ther's Death, informs him of the Manner of it, and joins with him in conspiring the Mur∣der of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hamlet,</HI> suspecting the Letters his two Schoolfellows carried to <HI>England</HI> contained some dangerous Instructions concerning him∣self, steals them, and upon examining them finds therein an earnest Request from his Uncle to the King of <HI>England,</HI> to put him to Death on his Arrival at his Court.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> suppresses this Letter, and writes another in the Name of his Uncle to the same King, in which he desires him to put the Bearers of that Letter to Death; this Packet he lays in the Place from whence he had taken the other.</P>
<P>The next Day they are attacked by a Py∣rate, they fight, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> boarding it alone, is taken Prisoner, and his two Companions continue their Voyage to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> prevails upon the Pirates to land him in <HI>Denmark</HI>; the King hearing of his Re∣turn, urges <HI>Laertes,</HI> who breathes nothing but
<PB N="266" REF="264"/>
Revenge against him, to kill him treacherous∣ly as they are fencing with Foils, to which he will engage him, by pretending to lay a Wa∣ger on his superior Skill at that Exercise.</P>
<P><HI>Laertes</HI> consents, and adds that he will anoint the Point of his Sword with a strong Poison, that if he draws Blood he may be sure to kill him.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the distracted <HI>Ophelia</HI> is accidentally drowned; the King, the Queen, and her Brother attend her Funeral: As soon as she is laid in the Earth, <HI>Laertes,</HI> in a Tran∣sport of Grief, leaps into her Grave. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> understanding that it is <HI>Ophelia</HI> whom they had buried, wildly asserting his Claim as a Lover to superior Sorrow, leaps into the Grave like∣wise, where <HI>Laertes,</HI> quite overcome with Rage and Grief, furiously fastens on him; they are with Difficulty parted by the King's Command, and some time after the King, as if nothing had happened, sends a Message to <HI>Hamlet,</HI> requesting him to fence with <HI>Laertes</HI> for a considerable Wager; <HI>Hamlet</HI> obeys, they meet in a Hall, the King and Queen be∣ing present.</P>
<P>The King, to make sure Work, after drinking <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Health, poisons the Wine, and offers the Cup to <HI>Hamlet</HI>; he refuses it, and the Queen, not knowing that the Wine is poisoned, drinks, though the King endea∣vours to prevent her. <HI>Laertes</HI> wounds <HI>Ham∣let</HI> with the poisoned Rapier, in the Scuffle
<PB N="267" REF="265"/>
they change Weapons, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> wounds <HI>Laertes,</HI> they both bleed; the Queen is seiz∣ed with the Agonies of Death, she tells her Son that the Wine is poisoned, and expires.</P>
<P><HI>Laertes,</HI> full of Remorse for the Treachery he had been guilty of, confesses the whole Contrivance, and the Part the King had in it. <HI>Hamlet</HI> stabs the King with the poisoned Sword that had wounded both him and <HI>Laertes,</HI> and upon the King's calling for Help obliges him to drink of the Wine he had poisoned.</P>
<P>The King dies, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> and <HI>Laertes</HI> exchanging Forgiveness with each other, both expire. <HI>Hamlet</HI> with his last Breath com∣manding his Friend, <HI>Horatio,</HI> who would have killed himself, to live and do Justice to his Fame, by declaring his Story to the World.</P>
<P>The Translation of the Story of <HI>Amleth</HI> from the <HI>Danish</HI> History of <HI>Saxo-Grammati∣cus,</HI> I was favoured with by a Friend; the Story itself is full of ridiculous Fancies, wild and improbable Circumstances, and as it is con∣ducted, has more the Appearance of a Ro∣mance than an Historical Fact.</P>
<P>That <HI>Shakespear</HI> founded his <HI>Tragedy of Hamlet</HI> upon it is very plain, but is it uncer∣tain whether he saw a literal Translation of it, or met with the Incidents drest up like a Novel, and perhaps with those Alterations which he has adopted in his Play. All the principal Circumstances are the same in the
<PB N="268" REF="266"/>
Play as the History. In both a Prince mur∣ders his Brother, usurps his Dignity, and marries his Widow: The Son of the mur∣dered Prince resolves to revenge his Father; for that Purpose he feigns himself mad, and at last accomplishes his Design; several of the lesser Circumstances are also as exactly co∣pied, and others have afforded Hints for new ones.</P>
<P><HI>Amleth</HI> has a private Interview with his Mother, and kills the Spy who had been ap∣pointed to overhear their Conversation. <HI>Hamlet</HI> likewise visits the Queen in her Apartment, and kills <HI>Polonius,</HI> who had concealed himself behind the Hangings.</P>
<P>When the Spies are removed the Discourse of the two Princes is much the same; they reproach their Mothers with their incestuous Marriage, sharply reprove them for their Crimes declare their Madness to be feigned, and enjoin them to Secresy.</P>
<P>The Embassy to <HI>England</HI> is designed after the History. <HI>Shakespear</HI> indeed makes <HI>Hamlet,</HI> after two Days Absence, be set on shore a∣gain at <HI>Denmark;</HI> and <HI>Amleth</HI> in the History arrives in <HI>England,</HI> has his Companions hang∣ed, and marries the King's Daughter before he comes back. But <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Plan re∣quired the immediate Return of <HI>Hamlet;</HI> however the Contrivance of changing the Let∣ters are the same, and of punishing the trea∣cherous Bearers of them. <HI>Shakespear</HI> makes
<PB N="269" REF="267"/>
those Bearers the Schoolfellows, and profest Friends of <HI>Hamlet;</HI> a Circumstance which heightens their Baseness, and justifies the Ar∣tifice he uses to procure their Punishment.</P>
<P>The Design of entrapping <HI>Amleth</HI> by means of a Girl, has not been wholly neglected by <HI>Shakespear,</HI> though he manages this Incident much more decently. <HI>Ophelia,</HI> with whom he is in Love, is ordered to throw herself in his way, and the King and his Confident listen to their Conversation. 'Tis very easy to see he took the Hint of this Stratagem from the Story, though it is very differently conduct∣ed, for <HI>Ophelia</HI> is not a loose Wanton as in the History, but a Woman of Honour, with whom he is in love. The accidental killing of her Father, and her Distraction, which was caused by it, is all his own Invention, and would have made a very affecting Episode if the Lady had been more modest in her Frenzy, and the Lover more uniformly af∣flicted for her Death; for at his first hearing it he expresses only a slight Emotion; pre∣sently he jumps into her Grave, fiercely de∣mands to be buried with her, fights with her Brother for professing to love her, then grows calm, and never thinks of her any more.</P>
<P>The Ghost is wholly the Invention of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> as is likewise the King's concert∣ed Scheme with <HI>Laertes,</HI> to kill <HI>Hamlet</HI> trea∣cherously as they fenced, or if he failed to poison the Wine. The King is killed by <HI>Hamlet</HI> both in the History and the Play, but
<PB N="270" REF="268"/>
in the Play he is stabb'd in the midst of his Friends, Guards, and Attendants; in the History as he is rising in Confusion from his Bed, and unable to draw his Sword to defend himself.</P>
<P>Here the Historian, romantic as his Relati∣on seems, has the Advantage of the Poet in Probability. After <HI>Amleth</HI> has secured his Uncle's Attendants, taken away his Sword from him, and placed his own, which was fastened to the Scabbard, in its stead; it was not difficult for him to kill him disarmed, and without any Assistance.</P>
<P>But <HI>Shakespear</HI> makes <HI>Hamlet</HI> execute his Vengeance on the King in a public Hall, crouded with his Attendants and Guards, and surrounded by his Friends; none of these of∣fer to assist him, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> has leisure enough after he has stabbed him to make him drink some of the Wine he had poisoned, lest his Sword had not compleated the Work.</P>
<P>The Queen's Death, by drinking ignorantly of the poisoned Wine is a beautiful Stroke of the Poet's. The History shews her unfortu∣nate, but <HI>Shakespear</HI> makes the same Man who seduced her to Wickedness be her invo∣luntary Murderer, and at once the Cause and Punisher of her Guilt.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> has with Reason been censured for the Catastrophe of this Tragedy. The brave, the injured <HI>Hamlet</HI> falls with the Mur∣derers
<PB N="271" REF="269"/>
he punishes; one Fate overwhelms a∣like the innocent and the guilty. In the History we find he did not live long after the severe Revenge he took for his Father's Mur∣der, but was unfortunately killed in Battle. <HI>Shakespear</HI> would not so far deviate from the History as to leave him happy and in Peace, though he has hastened his Death as well as changed the Manner of it. He is killed by the treacherous Contrivance of the King, and <HI>Laertes</HI> is the Instrument of that Treachery, which is afterwards turned upon himself.</P>
<P>As <HI>Laertes</HI> is a subordinate Character in the Play, it seems to be a Fault in <HI>Shakespear</HI> to shew him with a Similitude of Manners, under the same Circumstances, and acting up∣on the same Principles as <HI>Hamlet,</HI> his Hero. <HI>Laertes</HI> is brave and generous; his Father is murdered basely as he is informed; Duty and Honour incite him to revenge his Death, and he does so.</P>
<P>This Sameness of Character, and Parity of Circumstances with the Hero, lessens his Importance, and almost divides our Attention and Concern between them; an Effect which <HI>Shakespear</HI> certainly did not intend to produce, nor can it be lessened by the Consideration of the treacherous Measures <HI>Laertes</HI> was prevail∣ed upon to enter into against <HI>Hamlet,</HI> who had murdered his Father. In this he does not differ much from <HI>Hamlet,</HI> who did not attempt by open Force to revenge his Father's Mur∣der
<PB N="272" REF="270"/>
on his Uncle, but designed to accomplish it by Subtilty and Craft.</P>
<P>The same Equality is preserved in their Deaths, and in their Actions throughout the Play. <HI>Laertes</HI> wounds <HI>Hamlet</HI> with the poi∣soned Weapon, in the Scuffle they change Rapiers, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> wounds <HI>Laertes,</HI> and they exchange Forgiveness with each other be∣fore they die.</P>
<P>Thus has <HI>Shakespear,</HI> undesignedly, no doubt given us two Heroes instead of one in this Play; the only Difference between them is that one of them is a Prince, the other a No∣bleman, and but for this slight Distinction the Play might have been as well called the <HI>Tra∣gedy of Laertes</HI> as <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>
<P>It ought to be observed that <HI>Shakespear</HI> has not been led into this Error by the History; the Character of <HI>Laertes,</HI> and all the Circum∣stances relating to him is his own, which he has introduced by making the Spy, who is killed, Father of <HI>Laertes.</HI></P>
<P>The Madness of <HI>Hamlet</HI> seems to be less essential to the Play than the History; in the latter it affords him the Means of executing a Contrivance, which, absurd as it is, secures the Accomplishment of his Revenge; but in the Play it is of no other Use than to enliven the Dialogue, unless its Usefulness may be de∣duced from its bringing on such Accidents as it was assumed to prevent; for <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Mad∣ness
<PB N="273" REF="271"/>
alarms the King's Suspicion, and that produces the treacherous Embassy to <HI>England,</HI> which failing, the Contrivance of the poison∣ed Rapier followed, and that does the Busi∣ness.</P>
<P>But since the King's conscious Guilt and Terror might reasonably have created a Distrust of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and that Distrust, and a Desire of Security induced him to seek his Death, what need had <HI>Shakespear</HI> to make his Heroe's Sense and Discretion appear doubtful, by shewing him feigning a Madness, destructive to his Safety, and which he himself knows to be so, and yet persists in.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> has indeed followed the History in making <HI>Hamlet</HI> feign himself mad; but that Madness being of no Consequence to the prin∣cipal Design of the Play, as it is in the His∣tory, or if of Consequence it hurts the Repu∣tation of his Hero, 'tis certainly a Fault; for at least he only produces the same Events by a Blunder, which might have happened without it.</P>
<P>The Violation of poetical Justice is not the only Fault that arises from the Death of <HI>Hamlet;</HI> the revenging his Father's Murder is the sole End of all his Designs, and the great Business of the Play, and the noble and fixed Resolution of <HI>Hamlet</HI> to accomplish it, makes up the most shining Part of his Character; yet this great End is delayed till after <HI>Hamlet</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="272"/>
is mortally wounded: He stabs the King im∣mediately upon the Information of his Trea∣chery to himself! thus his Revenge becomes interested, and he seems to punish his Uncle rather for his own Death, than the Murder of the King, his Father.</P>
