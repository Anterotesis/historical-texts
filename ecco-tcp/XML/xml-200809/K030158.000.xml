<L>To PUFF, or not to Puff—that is the Question—</L>
<L>Puff by all means, say I, it helps digestion.</L>
<L>To prove my maxim true, pray read the Papers—</L>
<L>From <HI>Quacks of State,</HI> to those who cure the Vapours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You'll find them, one and all, puff high their skill,</L>
<L>Tho' nine in ten, are oft'ner found to kill.—</L>
<L>Yet Puff's the word, which gives at least a name,</L>
<L>And oftener gains the <HI>undeserving</HI> Fame:</L>
<L>Or wherefore read we of <HI>Lord Fanny</HI>'s Taste,</L>
<L>Of <HI>me</HI>—an Actor—<HI>wonderfully chaste</HI>!</L>
<L>And yet so squeamish is our Lady elf,</L>

<L>To stop, with <HI>Puff direct,</HI> the Critic Pack,</L>
<L>Who yelp, and foaming, bark from morn to night,</L>
<L>And when run hard—turn tail—then snap and bite;</L>
<L>Putting the timid Hare-like-Bard to flight.</L>
<L>To such, the best and only Puff to hit,</L>
<L>Is that which honest CANDOUR must admit,</L>
<L>A Female Scribbler is an harmless Wit;</L>
<L>And who so harmless as our present Bard,</L>
<L>Claiming no greater or distinct reward,</L>
<L>Than what from free Translation is her due,</L>
<L>Which here in fullest trust she leaves to you:</L>
<L>With this remark—Who own their Debts with pride,</L>
<L>Are well entitled to the Credit Side.</L>
<L>And as for those with whom she makes so free</L>
<L>They'll ne'er complain of English Liberty;</L>
<L>But glory to behold their Tinsel shine,</L>
<L>Through the rich Bullion of the English Line.</L>

<L>Fear then avaunt! Trust to a BRITISH JURY—</L>
<L>With them, an honest Verdict I'll ensure you:</L>

<P>COME, come, is not every thing ready? Is not the ball-room prepared yet? It is past ten o'Clock.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have only to fix up the new chande∣delier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll have no new chandelier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>My master said the last ball he gave, the company were in the dark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if you blind them with too much light, they will be in the dark still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>The musicians, sir, wish for some wine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blunty.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, before the ball begins? No, tell them if they are tipsy at the end of if, it will be quite soon enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are always so cross, Mr. Blunty, when my master is going to have company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not I a right to be cross? For while the whole house is in good humour, if there was not one person cross enough to take a little care, every thing would be wasted and ruined through extreme good temper. <STAGE>A man crosses the stage.</STAGE> Here, you —Mister—Pray are you the person who was sent with the chandelier?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shopman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then please to take it back again—We don't want it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shopman.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is your objection to it, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will cost too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shopman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bluntly, all the trades people are more frightened at you than at your master.—Sir George, Heaven bless him! never cares how much a thing costs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, because he never cares whether he pays for it or not—but if he did, depend upon it he would be very particular. Tradesmen all wish to be paid for their ware, don't they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shopman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why will they force so many unne∣cessary things, and make so many extravagant charges as to put all power of payment out of the question?</P>

<P>How do you do, Mrs. Evans?<STAGE>Suddenly.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>What makes you sigh, Mr. Bluntly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What makes you smile?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>To see all the grand preparations for the ball this evening. I anticipate the joy my lady will take here, and I smile for <HI>her.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I sigh for my master.—I foresee all the bills that will be brought in, for this evening's expence, and I anticipate the sorrow it will one day be to <HI>him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider, Mr. Bluntly, your master has my lady's fortune to take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I consider he has your lady to take along with it; and I prophecy one will sick by him some time after the other is gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame.—My lady, I have no doubt, will soon cure Sir George of his extravagance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will then be by taking away the means. —Why, Lady Caroline is as extravagant as himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken.—She never gives routs, masquerades, balls, or entertainments of any kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she constantly goes to them whenever she is invited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I call but a slight imprudence—She has no wasteful indiscretions like Sir George. For instance, she never makes a lavish present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but she <HI>takes</HI> a lavish present, as rea∣dily as if she did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>And surely you cannot call that impru∣dence</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I call it something worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, although she loves gaming to dis∣traction, and plays deep, yet she never loses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but she always wins—and <HI>that</HI> I call something worse.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>A loud rapping at the street door.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's the company. Will you permit me, Mr. Bluntly, to stand in one corner, and have a peep at them?</P>

<P>If you please. <STAGE>Rapping again.</STAGE> What spirit there is in that, Rat, tat, tat, tat.—And what life, frolic, and joy, the whole house is going to ex∣perience except myself. As for me, I am ready to cry at the thoughts of it all. <STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came, my lady, to see the preparations making on <HI>your</HI> account—for it is upon your account alone, that Sir George gives this grand <HI>fê<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I do flatter myself it is.—But where is he? What is it o'clock?—It was impossible to stay at the stupid opera.—How do I look? I once did intend to wear those set of diamonds Sir George presented me with the other morning—but then, I reflected again, that if—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my lady, what a charming thing to have such a lover—Sir George prevents every wish— he must make the best of husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet my father wishes to break off the marriage—he talks of his prodigality—and, cer∣tainly, Sir George lives above his income.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, Madam, so does every body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Caroline</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir George ought undoubtedly to change his conduct, and not be thus continually giving balls and entertainments—and inviting to his table ac∣quaintance, that not only come to devour his dinners and suppers, but him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Evans</SPEAKER>
<P>And there are people malicious enough to call your ladyship one of his devourers too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a treaty of marriage is so nearly concluded between us, I think, Mrs Evans, I am at liberty to visit Sir George, or to receive his presents, without having my character, or my delicacy called in question. <STAGE>A loud rapping</STAGE> The company are coming: is it not strange he is not here to receive them. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> EVANS.</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lucre.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, though I have no money of my own, yet you know I can always raise friends—and by heaven! my dear Sir George, I often wish to see you reduced to my circumstances, merely to prove how much I could, and <HI>would,</HI> do to serve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sincerely thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lucre.</SPEAKER>
<P>And one can better ask a favour for one's friend than for one's-self, you know: for when one wants to borrow money on one's own account, there are so many little delicacies to get the better of—such as I felt just now.—I was as pale as death, I dare say, when I asked you for this money—did not you perceive I was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say I did.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lucre.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you must have observed I hesitated, and looked very foolish.</P>

<P>Oh, my dear brother! I cannot ex∣press half the uneasiness I feel when you part from me, though but for the shortest space.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why?</P>

<P>What do you mean?</P>

<P>Nay, do not be angry; but every time you go out into this tempting town, where superflu∣ous riches continually meet the eye of the poor, I tremble lest you should forfeit your honesty for that, which Heaven decreed should not belong to you.</P>

<P>Your master, Mr. Bluntly, is a very good man—a very generous man—and I hope at least he has found me a very lucky one; for good luck is all the recommendation which I, in my humble station, aspire to—and since I have been Sir George's attorney, I have gained him no less than two law-suits.</P>

<P>Is that the situation of your lodgers at present?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what am I to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no time to be lost. Consider, that Mr. Manly, the lawyer, whom your father em∣ployed, is a man who pretends to a great deal of mo∣rality; and it was he who, when your father found himself dying, alarmed his conscience, and persuaded him to make this Will in favour of a second person. Now, I think that you and I both together, ought to have a meeting with this conscientious lawyer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I should imagine, Mr. Blackman, that if he is really a conscientious man, you and he will not be upon good terms.</P>

<P>Oh! people of our avocation differ in respect to conscience. Puzzle, confound, and abuse each other, and yet are upon good terms.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
find proofs? Suppose I have them already by me? —But upon this occasion, you must not only rely implicitly on what I say, but it is necessary you should say the same yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you advance no falsehood, I cannot have any objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Falsehood!—falsehood—I appre∣hend, Sir George, you do not consider, that there is a particular construction put upon words and phrases in the practice of the law, which the rest of the world, out of that study, are not clearly acquainted with. For instance, <HI>falsehood</HI> with <HI>us,</HI> is not <HI>exactly</HI> what it is with other people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! Is truth, immutable truth, to be corrupted and confounded by men of the law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not speaking of truth—that, we have nothing to do with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, must not say so, however, sir.— And in this crisis of my sufferings, it is the only com∣fort, the only consolatory reflection left me, that truth and I, will never separate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stick to your truth—but confide in me as usual.—You will go with me, then, to Mr. Manly, your father's lawyer, and corroborate all that I shall say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, but what you intend to say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't do that. In the practice of the law, we never know what we intend to say—and
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
therefore our blunders, when we make them, are in some measure excusable—and if I should chance to make a blunder or two, I mean any trivial mistake, when we come before this lawyer, you must promise not to interfere, or in any shape contradict me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mere lapse of memory, I have no∣thing to do with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>And my memory grows very bad; therefore you must not disconcert me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, let us begone—I am ready to go with you this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must first go home, and prepare a few writings.</P>

<P>My dear Blackman, I beg your pardon for what I am going to say; but as you behave thus friendly on this unfortunate occasion, I must confess to you—that till now I always hated you—I could not bear the sight of you.—For I thought you (I wish I may die if I did not) one of the greatest rogues in the world. I fancied you only waited on, and ad∣vised my master to make your market of him.— But now your attention to him in his distress, when

all his friends have forsaken him, is so kind—Heaven bless you—Heaven bless you—I'll go buy a black coat.</P>

<P>I have something more to say to you.— When you have put on this coat, you must meet your master and meat Mr Manley's, the lawyer; and when we are all there, you must mind and say, exactly what I say.</P>

<P>And will you not venture to say yes, and no, to what I shall advance?</P>

<P>Why—I think I may venture to say yes to your no, and no to your yes, with a safe conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you do not instantly follow me and do all that I shall propose, your master is ruined.— Would you see him dragged to prison?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I would sooner go myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then why do you stand talking about a safe conscience. Half my clients would have been ruined if I had shewn my zeal as you do. Conscience indeed! Why, this is a matter of law, to serve your master in his necessity.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>She, my sister! Her pretended father my uncle too! <STAGE>Aside</STAGE> Blackman, you would have plunged me into an anguish I never knew before; you would have plunged me into shame.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you <HI>have</HI> me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw.—Mr. Manly, notwithstanding you are these people's voucher, this appears but a scheme.—These persons are but adventurers, and may possibly have about them forgeries, such as an honest man, like myself, would shudder at.</P>

<P><STAGE>Going to the door.</STAGE> Who's there? <STAGE>Enter Servant.</STAGE> Shew that—that Mr. Blackman, out of my house instantly; and take care you never admit him again.</P>

<P>Sir George, will you suffer this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and a great deal more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bluntly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'ee Blackman.—If you don't fall down upon your knees, and beg my pardon at the street door, for the trick you have put upon me, in assuring me my master's sister was really dead, and that I could do her no injury, by doing him a service —if you don't beg my pardon for this, I'll give you such an assault and battery as you never had to do with in your life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blackman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beat me—do, beat me—I'll thank you for beating me—I'd be beat every hour of the day, to recover damages. <STAGE><HI>Exit with</HI> BLUNTLY.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sister—with the sincerest joy I call you by that name—and while I thus embrace you, offer you a heart, that beats with all the pure and tender affection, which our kindred to each other claims—In you <STAGE>embracing his uncle</STAGE> I behold my
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
father; and experience an awful fear, mingled with my regard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Continue still that regard, and even that fear—these filial sentiments may prove important; and they shall ever be repaid with my paternal watch∣ings, friendship, and love.</P>

<P>My brother—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been unworthy of you—I will be so no more, but imitate your excellence. Yet when I reflect—</P>

<STAGE>LADY CAROLINE <HI>comes softly from the inner apartment, and attends to the discourse.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother, do not imagine—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave me, leave me to all the agonies of my misconduct — Where is my fortune? Now <HI>all</HI> irrecoverably gone—My last, my only resource is now to be paid to another—I have lost every thing.</P>
</SP>

<P><STAGE>Coming forward.</STAGE> No, Sir George, <HI>nothing</HI>—since I possess all that was yours.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Caroline.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold a friend in your necessities —a mistress whom your misfortunes cannot drive away —but who, experiencing much of your unkindness, still loves you; and knowing your every folly, will still submit to honour, and obey you.</P>
<P>I received your lavish presents, but to hoard them for you—made myself mistress of your fortune, but to return it to you—and with it, all my own.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can this be real? Can I be raised in one moment, from the depths of misery to unbounded happiness?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>A young man, who says he is Mr. Will∣ford's son, is called to enquire for him.</P>

<P>Shew him in.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>SIR GEORGE <HI>and</HI> LADY CAROLINE <HI>retire to the back part of the stage.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> HENRY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Henry, and take leave of your sister for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, sir?—What do you mean? To be parted from her, would be the utmost rigour of fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>The affection with which you speak, young gentleman, seems to convey something beyond mere brotherly love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I some years since revealed to him she was <HI>not</HI> his sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he, some years since, implied it to me. Yet, in such doubtful terms, I knew not which of us had the sorrow not to be your child.—I now find it is myself—and I aver it to be a sorrow, for which, all the fortune I am going to possess will not repay me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my dearest sister, indulge the hope you may yet be his daughter. This young
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
man's merit deserves a reward, and in <HI>time</HI> he may learn to love you by a still nearer tie than that, you have so long known to exist between you; nay, even by a nearer tie than that of brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in doubt or what I hear—Eleanor, since our short separation, there cannot surely have been any important discovery—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not surprised—great discoveries, which we labour in vain for years to make, are frequently brought about in one lucky moment, without any la∣bour at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—for till this day arose, I had passed every hour since my birth, without making one discovery to my advantage—while this short, but pro∣pitious morning, has discovered to me—how to be in future happy.</P>

<L>"LONG before the beginng of this Play,"</L>
<L>I heard some DEEP ones in the Green Room, say,</L>
<L>They had their fears and doubts—whilst some did quake—</L>
<L>And others wish'd it bed-time for her sake.</L>
<L>Do you, our best Physicians, ever kind,</L>
<L>Prescribe our true Cephalic for the Mind,</L>
<L>Of these our Neighbours, and <HI>kind Friends</HI>—behind,</L>
<L>And with it, give a cordial of the best,</L>
<L>To one, with deepest Gratitude imprest.</L>
<L>For some there are—I have them in my eye—</L>
<L>Will sicken and turn pale with jealousy,</L>
<L>Whene'er we scribbling Women wield the Pen,</L>
<L>Or dare invade the Rights of scribbling Men;</L>
<L>And fir'd with zeal, in dread array appear—</L>
<L>With Tenets from the <HI>learned</HI> Hemisphere;</L>
<L>Thence cry <HI>(kind Souls)</HI> "Invention is the only Art,</L>
<L>"And mere Translation but a second Part;</L>
<L>"Besides—<HI>we Men of Taste</HI>—can ne'er withstand</L>
<L>"E'en Nature's GARRICK thus at second Hand!</L>
<L>"Then why do Comic Writers live on Theft,</L>
<L>"When such Ragouts and Dainties still are le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t?</L>
<L>"Not richer were, in CONGREVE's day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> BEHN,</L>
<L>"For now, the Males are Females—Women, Men—</L>
<L>"Nay some so <HI>manly,</HI> and so orthodox,</L>
<L>"Will drive you four in Hand—or h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld the Box;</L>
<L>"And if perchance the fatal Die is thrown,</L>
<L>"Will storm and swear, like any Lord in Town."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But might I whisper in this Censor's ear,</L>
<L>I'd prove his observations too severe—</L>
<L><PB REF="68"/>And urge—"Translation to hit off with skill,</L>
<L>"Is not the province of each common Quill;</L>
<L>"But by improving what was writ before,</L>
<L>"Tho' Genius may be less, our Judgment's more;</L>
<L>"And whilst we paint with energy from Life,</L>
<L>"The gallant Husband, or <HI>more gallant Wife,</HI></L>
<L>"With Tints from living Portraits from the Spot,</L>
<L>"It matters not by whom related—or begot;</L>
<L>"And thus, much surer shall we reach the Heart,</L>
<L>"Than all the <HI>lifeless</HI> pomp of <HI>boasted</HI> Art."</L>
<L>As such, deny her not—at least the merit</L>
<L>Of giving <HI>Gallic Froth</HI>—true BRITISH SPIRIT.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And as for you, ye Fair, how blooms the Cheek,</L>
<L>How sweet the Temper which those eyes bespeak?</L>
<L>No Midnight Oil has e'er destroy'd a Grace,</L>
<L>Or Gaming's Horrors found with you a place;</L>
<L>But Cupid lent you all those winning Arts,</L>
<L>Which at a glance—can warm the coldest Hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Check then with me these Censors as unjust,</L>
<L>Who form their judgments—<HI>as they live</HI>—on Trust.</L>
<L>Nor ever credit what they dare to say,</L>
<L>Unless with you they join, and like our Play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Use for a signal then—your Magic Fan,</L>
<L>And all the House will follow to a Man;</L>
<L>Or should there be a disaffected few—</L>
<L><HI>A Counter Revolution</HI>—rests with you.</L>
