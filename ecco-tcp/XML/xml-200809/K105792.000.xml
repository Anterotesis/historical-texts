<P>THE SCHOOL for ARROGANCE: A <HI>COMEDY.</HI></P>
<P>AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN.</P>
<P>BY THOMAS HOLCROFT.</P>
<P>THE SECOND EDITION.</P>
<P><HI>LONDON:</HI> PRINTED FOR G. G. J. AND J. ROBINSON, PATERNOSTER-ROW.</P>
<P>M. DCC. XCI.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Comedy of <HI>Le Glorieux,</HI> by M. Nericault Destouches, is the basis on which <HI>The School for Arrogance</HI> has been formed. From that I have taken the plan, several of the characters, and some of the scenes. Difference of arrangement, addi∣tional incidents, and what I deem to be es∣sential changes of character, have all been introduced. The Count has but little re∣semblance to the original: Lucy and Mac Dermot none. Lady Peckham is a new character, and was first suggested by a friend; who, conceiving highly of the contrast which exists in life, between the pride of rank and the pride of riches, industriously sought to stimulate and rouse my imagination.</P>
<P>The subject of the piece is greatly inte∣resting to morals, and highly worthy of the Theatre. Conscious of the great effects a perfect Comedy might have produced, I re∣gret the imperfections of the present. Some good it will do: I regret that it cannot do more. Persuaded as I am of the moral
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
dignity of the stage, I cherish an enthusiastic wish to see the dramatic art surpass even all its former sublime efforts. Among the pleasures of the imagination, how frequently has its place been the first! Happy indeed should I be, could my success add the smallest impulse to the exertions of Genius: ineffa∣bly happy, would but this noble art once more boldly assert its rank; and render it∣self, not only the general love and delight of mankind, but the veneration of the wise.</P>
<P>It is with peculiar pleasure that I here ac∣knowledge how much I am indebted to the conduct of Mr. Marshal; who, in conse∣quence of the prejudices which it was ima∣gined Mr. Harris laboured under, respecting me, acted, for a time, in my behalf, as the author of the piece. Though anxiously zealous for its success, he still continued impartially attentive to the interests of all parties; and sacrificed his own feelings to promote what he conceived to be a public good.</P>
<P>The tribute of justice is also due to Mr. Harris. This tribute I am happy to have an opportunity to pay. And, that I may
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
now be consistent, as I always have been, in my private and public language to Mr. Harris, I will here insert a copy of a letter which I wrote to him, when the comedy had been twice performed.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE patiently waited the proper moment in which to write to you. That moment I hope is now come. I should be guilty of injustice, were I any longer to delay expressing my sense of the pro∣priety with which you have acted, rela∣tively to The School for Arrogance, after you had every reason to suppose it mine. Such conduct, Sir, is highly honourable; and is not only productive of the best ef∣fects, but must secure the best and most permanent applause. That you had con∣ceived disadvantageous ideas of me I knew; though I have no doubt but I shall ulti∣mately convince you that, even supposing me to be mistaken, my motives have been laudable ***** <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A single phrase, which relates entirely to myself, is here omitted.</NOTE>. With me you were
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
irritated; but you had the justice to forget the man, and promote the interests of the piece. This I hold it my duty to say to the world at large.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I am, Sir, Your obliged humble servant,</SALUTE>

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To THOMAS HARRIS, Esq.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mr. Harris kindly expressed the satisfac∣tion which his own private feelings received, from this letter; nor can there be a doubt but that the propriety of his conduct, under such circumstances, will be as agreeable to himself, and as pleasing to the public, as it has been to me.</P>

<P>ONCE again, Mr. Mac Dermot, have done with this nonsense.</P>

<P>Arrah, and why so scoffish? Sure now a little bit of making love—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! Do me the favour to answer my questions. The Count, your master, is in love with Miss Lucy Peckham?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, and you may say that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he really well born?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! As for that, honey, let him alone. The noblest blood of France, aye, and what is better, of Ireland too, trickles to his finger's ends. The Villars and the O'Connol∣lies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he wishes to marry into the family of the Peckhams?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The divle a bit, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is viry willing to marry the young Lady, but not her family. His pride and his passion have had many a tough battle about that, d'ye see. Only think! A direct descindant of the former kings of Ireland, and collateral cousin to a prisent peer of France, to besmear and besmoulder his dignity by rubbing it against porter butts, vinegar casks, and beer barrels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Lucy is indeed a lovely girl, animated to excess, and sometimes apparently giddy and flighty: but she has an excellent understanding, and a noble heart; and these are superior to birth, which is indeed a thing of mere accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, and that it is—I, a simple Irishman, as I am—why now, I would have been born a duke, had they been civil enough to have asked my consint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Count fell in love with her at the convent, to which she was sent to improve her French.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where I think you first met with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—she saw me friendless, and conceived a generous and disinterested affection
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
for me.—He has followed her to England; has taken apartments in our neighbourhood, and lives in splendour—yet is not rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Um, um.—No—But then he is a Colonel in the Irish brigade; and, beside his pay, has sacrit supplies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, and I don't believe he knows that himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's strange!—His pride is ex∣cessive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>To spake the truth, that now is his failing.—An if it was not for that, oh! he would be the jewel of a master!—He trates his infariors with contimpt, keeps his distance with his aquals, and values the rubbishing dust of his great grandfathers above diamonds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>His character is in perfect contrast to that of his humble rival, Sir Samuel Sheepy; who, even when he addresses a footman, is all bows and affability; whose chief discourse is, Yes, if you please, and, No, thank you; and who, in the company of his mistress, stammers, blun∣ders, and blushes, like a great boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you till me? He the ri∣val of the Count my master! That old—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bachelor, and only fifty; rich, of a good family, and a great favourite with Lady Peckham, by never having the courage to contradict her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mac D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there now! You talk of the Count's pride! Here is this city lady as proud as ten counts! Her own coach horses, ready harnessed, don't carry their heads higher! And then she is as insolent, and as vulgar, and—Hem!</P>

<P>This sudden return, Sir, is kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have bethought me. The mo∣ment is critical, and what I have to communi∣cate of importance. Are we secure?</P>

<P>No. But I have written to him anonymously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why anonymously?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To rouse his feelings, wound his vanity, and excite his anger. His slumbering faculties must be awakened.—Is he kind to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Yet I believe him to be gene∣rous, benevolent, and noble of heart; though his habitual haughtiness gives him the appear∣ance of qualities the very reverse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Worthy, kind girl!—You were born for the consolation of a too unfortunate father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again you remind me that I have a father. Why am I not allowed to see him? Why am I not suffered to fly into his arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He dreads lest his wretched and pitiable condition should make you meet him with coldness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! How little does he know my heart! Yet speak; tell me, what monster was the cause of his misery?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The monster Pride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pride!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your mother's pride, which first squandered his wealth, and next endangered his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you alarm me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A despicable dispute for preceden∣cy was the occasion of a duel, in which your father killed his antagonist, whose enraged fa∣mily, by suborning witnesses, caused him to be convicted of murder, obliged him to fly the kingdom, and with your mother wander under a borrowed name, a fugitive in distant coun∣tries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens!—But why leave me ig∣norant of my birth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That, being unfortunate, you might be humble: that you might not grieve after happiness which you seemed destined
<PB N="24" REF="34"/>
not to enjoy. 'Twas the precaution of a fond father, desirous to alleviate, if not succour your distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! How I burn to see him!—Is he not in danger? Is his life secure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He himself can scarcely say. His enemies have discovered him, are hot in pursuit, and fertile in stratagems and snares. They know that justice is now busied in his behalf; but justice is slow, and revenge is restless.—Their activity, I hear, is redoubled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Guard, I conjure you, guard my fa∣ther's safety! Let me fly to seek him! Conduct me to his feet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He wished you first to be informed of his true situation; lest, knowing him to be noble, you should expect to see him in all the pomp of affluence, instead of meeting a poor, dejected, forlorn old man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>His fears are unjust; injurious to every feeling of filial affection and duty! The little I have I will freely partake with him. My clothes, the diamond which my supposed mother left me, whatever I possess shall instantly be sold for his relief: my life shall be devoted to soften his sorrows. Oh that I could prove myself wor∣thy to be his daughter! Oh that I could pour out my soul to secure his felicity!</P>

<P>The sister of the Count! I!—Ah! Nature, thy instincts are fabulous: for, were they not, his heart would have beaten as warmly toward me, as mine has done for him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will make him blush at his ar∣rogance. You shall witness his confusion; which shall be public, that it may be effectual.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you have me avoid explana∣tion with him?</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, for the present.—I mean to see him. Our meeting will be warm; but he shall feel the authority of a father.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are a stranger to him, I fear lest—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no. He knows me, but knows not all his obligations to me.—I have secretly supplied him with money, and gained him pro∣motion; which he has vainly attributed to his personal merits. But I must be gone. My bur∣thened heart is eased! Once more, dear child of my affections, be prudent. I have much to ap∣prehend; but, should the present moment prove benign, my future days will all be peace!</P>

<P>You are above the poor, the pitiful idea, that wealth confers any claims?</P>

person for whom you think my heart is any way interested! Your passions are all subservient to love!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam; subservient is the very word! They are all subservient to love!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You never recollect the dignity of your descent, nor accuse mine of meanness! You have too much understanding to plume your thoughts with turgid arrogance; or to pre∣sume on the imaginary merit of an accident, which none but ignorance, prejudice, and folly, are so besotted as to attribute to themselves!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mankind have agreed, Madam, to honour the descendants of the wise and the brave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have so—But you have too much native merit to arrogate to yourself the worth of others! You are no jay, decked in the pea∣cock's feathers! You are not idiot enough to imagine that a skin of parchment, on which is emblazoned the arms and acts of one wise man, with a long list of succeeding fools, is any ho∣nour to you! Responsible to mankind for the use or the abuse of such talents as you feel yourself endowed with, you think only of how you may deserve greatly; and disdain to be that secondary thing, that insignificant cypher, which is worthless except from situation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Count.</SPEAKER>
<P>The feelings of injured honour, Ma∣dam, perhaps may be too irritable. They shrink from insult, and spurn at contamination! Yet honour is the source of a thousand virtues! The parent of ten thousand glorious deeds! Ho∣nour is generous, sincere, and magnanimous! The protector of innocence, the assertor of right, the
<PB N="48" REF="62"/>
avenger of wrong! Yes! Honour is the patron of arts, the promoter of science, the bulwark of government, the defender of kings, and the sa∣viour of nations!—Indulge me then in cherishing a sentiment so noble!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indulge?—Applaud, you mean! Ho∣nour with you never degenerates into ostenta∣tion! Is never presumptuous! Is no boaster! Is eager to earn, but scorns to extort pre-eminence! Your honour is not that abject inflated phantom which usurps contested claims, exacts submission which it does not merit, offends, irritates, and incites disgust, nay tarnishes even virtue itself! You do not, under the word Honour, seek a miserable cobweb covering for exorbitant pride!</P>

<P>Chequered are the scenes of life. Pleasure and pain, joy and grief, austerity and laughter, intermingling, weave a motley web. Our prejudices are our punishments: they cling about us, warp our actions, distort our manners, render us the food of satire, the mockery of fools, and torture us, as wailing ur∣chins are tormented to make sport for boys. Error and folly impede the progress of perfec∣tion.
<PB N="100" REF="122"/>
Truth alone can make men wise and happy. Myself the sacrifice of falsehood and mistake, feebly have I striven to stem the tor∣rent▪ and here my task, and here I hope my troubles end.</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>THE curtain dropt, of course the author sends</L>
<L>Me to salute our gen'rous noble friends!</L>
<L>To me you listen, he politely says,</L>
<L>Whene'er I prattle, with a wish to praise.</L>
<L>For kindness so unceasing may you be</L>
<L>As happy, ev'ry soul, as your applause makes me!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But to my text—The theme to-night is Pride:</L>
<L>Much have we said—and much more have implied.</L>
<L>Our boldest strokes are feeble, nor can shew</L>
<L>The child of Pride with half his genuine glow;</L>
<L>Of Pride, which can such various forms assume;</L>
<L>Now rise an emperor, now sink a groom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mounted aloft, the wonder of his age,</L>
<L>With hackney coachmen furious war to wage;</L>
<L>Six swandown waistcoats swathe him into shape;</L>
<L>His legs all buckskin, and his coat all cape;</L>
<L>With manners, looks, and language such you'd swear</L>
<L>His tutor had been Piccadilly's Bear;</L>
<L>When most contemptible most hoping praise,</L>
<L>And only envious of the groom he pays;</L>
<L>Four dappled greys in front, behind three men;</L>
<L>Down Pall-Mall dashing, to da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up again;</L>
<L>Then only in his height and pomp of pride,</L>
<L>When Girl or Gambler's seated by his side;</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="124"/>
Driving by day, dicing by night, his passion;</L>
<L>Such is the modern man of high-flown fashion!</L>
<L>Such are the scions sprung from Runny-Mead!</L>
<L>The richest soil, that bears the rankest weed!</L>
<L>Potatoe like, the sprouts are worthless found;</L>
<L>And all that's good of them is under ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of Pride one single sketch in crayons more.</L>
<L>Behold her torch! Hark! Thunder shakes the door!</L>
<L>The carriage stops; the footmen make a lane;</L>
<L>The feathers stoop, and enter Lady Jane:</L>
<L>Perfect in how d'ye do, drop, bob, and bow.</L>
<L>(Curtseys, my friends, are out of fashion now)— <STAGE>[To the Galleries]</STAGE></L>
<L>First to his Grace; next to the next of birth:</L>
<L>She none forgets—save genius, wit, and worth;</L>
<L>Whom if she mark, 'tis with a modish stare,</L>
<L>To ask who knows them? or, How came they there?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now at the bank, in antichamber kept,</L>
<L>Where Pharaoh's host twelve tedious hours had slept,</L>
<L>She seats herself, like palpitating lover,</L>
<L>Eager the last night's losses to recover.</L>
<L>No sense of virtue, dignity, or shame:</L>
<L>Her greatest pride her knowledge of the game.</L>
<L>That pride most piqued, most mortified, to see</L>
<L>A Nabob's wife stake larger sums than she!</L>
<L>And now three anxious hours have slipt away:</L>
<L>Three hundreds have been lost, in piddling play.</L>
<L>No luck for her! Aloud fresh cards she calls:</L>
<L>Her passions rising as her pocket falls.</L>
<L>She punts: again she loses; and again!</L>
<L>Oaths quiver on her lip! She names the ten.</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="125"/>
Stung to the soul, a desp'rate sett she makes;</L>
<L>Till even the winning banker deals and quakes.</L>
<L>Ghastly she pants, with horror in her eye,</L>
<L>To be the first the fatal card to spy.</L>
<L>The fatal card is turn'd, and ends the reign</L>
<L>Of Fashion, Folly, Pride, and Lady Jane!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here too we end; oblig'd ourselves to own</L>
<L>Our pride is great—when we can please the town.</L>
