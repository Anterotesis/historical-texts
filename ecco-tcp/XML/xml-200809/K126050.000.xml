The Day of Judgment, Or, The GRAND RECKONING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>CHRISTIANS! profit by the warning,</L>
<L>Which the word of GOD supplies!</L>
<L>Think upon that awful morning,</L>
<L>When the quick and dead shall rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! each country, every nation,</L>
<L>All the globe we now behold,</L>
<L>(Wrapt in dreadful conflagration)</L>
<L>Smoke and fire at once enfold!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the works of art so curious,</L>
<L>Lofty cities, temples, towers!</L>
<L>See the raging flame so furious,</L>
<L>All the mighty mass devours!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You who doat on earthly treasures,</L>
<L>What dismay will seize your frame,</L>
<L>When the sum of all your pleasures,</L>
<L>Crackles in the general flame!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! the multitudes surrounding,</L>
<L>Whom the grave no more can keep?</L>
<L>Hark! the awful trumpet sounding!</L>
<L>Death has broke his leaden sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All that in the tomb now slumber,</L>
<L>How at once they burst their chain!</L>
<L>See they rise, how vast their number?</L>
<L>All that liv'd shall live again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great and small together meeting,</L>
<L>Lo! the sea gives up her dead!</L>
<L>Then the sea itself retreating,</L>
<L>Lo! the heavens and earth are fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the LORD of life descending,</L>
<L>Hear the dread ARCHANGEL'S voice;</L>
<L>See the dead on CHRIST attending;</L>
<L>How the saints of GOD rejoice!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Myriads at that voice shall gather,</L>
<L>"Take the kingdom long prepar'd;</L>
<L>"Come ye blessed of my FATHER,</L>
<L>"Share my crown, my cross you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>har'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O how different that dread sentence,</L>
<L>Which confirms the <HI>sinner</HI>'s doom▪</L>
<L>"You who died without repentance,</L>
<L>"Come to judgment, sinners come."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! to these what wild despairing,</L>
<L>What astonishment of heart,</L>
<L>Agony past human bearing,</L>
<L>Will that dreadful call impart!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You who now profanely cherish,</L>
<L>Unbelief and impious pride;</L>
<L>Unbelievers! see and perish,</L>
<L>CHRIST for you in vain has dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You who to the world dissemble,</L>
<L>While you practise deeds of night,</L>
<L>Hypocrites! behold and tremble,</L>
<L>All these deeds are brought to light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, who each conviction stifling,</L>
<L>Waste your time, that sacred store,</L>
<L>Hear the Angel, cease your trifling,</L>
<L>"Time," he cries, "shall be no more."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lost in ease, or drown'd in pleasure,</L>
<L>"We've no time to think," you cry,</L>
<L>But howe'er you waste the treasure,</L>
<L>You must all find time to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, who now this warning slighting,</L>
<L>Think that day not worth your care▪</L>
<L>I who now these lines am writing;</L>
<L>You and I must both appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O that you, these lines perusing,</L>
<L>May be wak'd to swift repentance;</L>
<L>O that I, no moment losing,</L>
<L>May prepare to meet my sentence!</L>
