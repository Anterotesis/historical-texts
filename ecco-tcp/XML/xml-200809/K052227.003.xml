<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Embassy to <HI>Achilles.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>AGamemnon</HI> after the last Day's Defeat, proposes to the <HI>Greeks</HI> to quit the Siege, and return to their Country. <HI>Diomed</HI> opposes this, and <HI>Nestor</HI> seconds him, praising his Wisdom and Resolution. He orders the Guard to be strengthen'd, and a Council summon'd to deliberate what Mea∣sures were to be follow'd in this Emergency. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> pursues this Advice, and <HI>Nestor</HI> farther prevails upon him to send Ambassadors to <HI>Achilles,</HI> in order to move him to a Recon∣ciliation. <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Ajax</HI> are made choice of, who are ac∣companied by old <HI>Phoenix.</HI> They make, each of them, very moving and pressing Speeches, but are rejected with Roughness by <HI>Achilles,</HI> who notwithstanding retains <HI>Phoenix</HI> in his Tent. The Ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the Camp, and the Troops betake themselves to sleep.</P>
<P>This Book, and the next following, take up the Space of one <HI>Night,</HI> which is the twenty seventh from the beginning of the Poem. The <HI>Scene</HI> lies on the Sea-shore, the Station of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Ships.</P>

<L>Sate on each Face, and sadden'd ev'ry heart.</L>
<L N="5">As from its cloudy Dungeon issuing forth,</L>

<L>Heaps Waves on Waves, and bids th' <HI>Aegean</HI> roar;</L>
<L>This way and that, the boiling Deeps are tost;</L>
<L N="10">Such various Passions urg'd the troubled Host.</L>
<L>Great <HI>Agamemnon</HI> griev'd above the rest;</L>
<L>Superior Sorrows swell'd his Royal Breast;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>Himself his Orders to the Heralds bears,</L>
<L>To bid to Council all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Peers,</L>
<L N="15">But bid in Whispers: These surround their Chief,</L>
<L>In solemn Sadness, and majestic Grief.</L>
<L>The King amidst the mournful Circle rose;</L>
<L>Down his wan Cheek a briny Torrent flows;</L>
<L>So silent Fountains, from a Rock's tall Head,</L>
<L N="20">In sable Streams soft-trickling Waters shed.</L>
<L>With more than vulgar Grief he stood opprest;</L>
<L>Words, mixt with Sighs, thus bursting from his Breast.</L>

<L N="25">Of partial <HI>Jove</HI> too justly we complain,</L>
<L>And heav'nly Oracles believ'd in vain;</L>
<L>A safe Return was promis'd to our toils,</L>
<L>With Conquest honour'd, and enrich'd with Spoils:</L>
<L>Now shameful flight alone can save the Host;</L>
<L N="30">Our Wealth, our People, and our Glory lost.</L>
<L>So <HI>Jove</HI> decrees, Almighty Lord of all!</L>
<L><HI>Jove,</HI> at whose Nod whole Empires rise or fall,</L>
<L>Who shakes the feeble Props of human Trust,</L>

Haste then, for ever quit these fatal Fields,</L>
<L>Haste to the Joys our native Country yields;</L>

<L>He said; deep Silence held the <HI>Grecian</HI> Band,</L>
<L N="40">Silent, unmov'd, in dire Dismay they stand,</L>
<L>A pensive Scene! 'till <HI>Tydeus'</HI> warlike Son</L>
<L>Roll'd on the King his Eyes, and thus begun.</L>

<LG>
<L>When Kings advise us to renounce our Fame,</L>
<L>First let him speak, who first has suffer'd Shame.</L>
<L N="45">If I oppose thee, Prince! thy Wrath with-hold,</L>
<L>The Laws of Council bid my Tongue be bold.</L>
<L>Thou first, and thou alone, in Fields of Fight,</L>
<L>Durst brand my courage, and defame my might;</L>
<L>Nor from a Friend th' unkind Reproach appear'd,</L>
<L N="50">The <HI>Greeks</HI> stood witness, all our Army heard.</L>
<L>The Gods, O Chief! from whom our honours spring,</L>
<L>The Gods have made thee but by halves a King;</L>
<L>They gave thee Scepters, and a wide Command,</L>
<L>They gave Dominion o'er the Seas and Land,</L>
<L N="55">The noblest Pow'r that might the World controul</L>
<L>They gave thee not—a brave and virtuous Soul.</L>

Is this a Gen'ral's Voice, that would suggest</L>
<L>Fears like his own to ev'ry <HI>Grecian</HI> Breast?</L>
<L>Confiding in our want of Worth, he stands,</L>
<L N="60">And if we fly, 'tis what our King commands.</L>
<L>Go thou inglorious! from th' embattel'd Plain;</L>
<L>Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the Main,</L>
<L>A nobler Care the <HI>Grecians</HI> shall employ,</L>
<L>To combate, conquer, and extirpate <HI>Troy.</HI></L>
<L N="65">Here <HI>Greece</HI> shall stay; or if all <HI>Greece</HI> retire,</L>

<L>Such Strength of Body, with such Force of Mind;</L>
<L N="75">In Conduct, as in Courage, you excell,</L>

Kings thou canst blame; a bold, but prudent Youth;</L>

<L>Then let me add what yet remains behind,</L>
<L>A Thought unfinish'd in that gen'rous Mind;</L>
<L N="85">Age bids me speak; nor shall th'Advice I bring</L>
<L>Distast the People, or offend the King.</L>

<LG>
<L>Curs'd is the Man, and void of Law and Right,</L>
<L>Unworthy Property, unworthy Light,</L>

<L N="90">That Wretch, that Monster, who delights in War:</L>
<L>Whose Lust is Murder, and whose horrid Joy,</L>
<L>To tear his Country, and his Kind destroy!</L>
<L>This Night, refresh and fortify thy Train;</L>
<L>Between the Trench and Wall, let Guards remain:</L>
<L N="95">Be that the Duty of the young and bold;</L>
<L>But thou, O King, to Council call the old:</L>
<L>Great is thy Sway, and weighty are thy Cares;</L>
<L>Thy high Commands must spirit all our Wars.</L>
<L>With <HI>Thracian</HI> Wines recruit thy honour'd Guests,</L>
<L N="100">For happy Counsels flow from sober Feasts.</L>

Wise, weighty Counsels aid a State distrest,</L>

<L>This dreadful Interval determines all;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus spoke the hoary Sage: the rest obey;</L>
<L N="110">Swift thro' the Gates the Guards direct their way.</L>
<L>His Son was first to pass the lofty Mound,</L>
<L>The gen'rous <HI>Thrasymed,</HI> in Arms renown'd:</L>

<L>Assembled States, and Lords of Earth obey,</L>

<L>O King! the Counsels of my Age attend;</L>

<L>Thee, Prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,</L>
<L>Pronounce with Judgment, with Regard give ear,</L>

<L>And ratify the best, for publick Good.</L>
<L>Nor, tho' a meaner give Advice, repine,</L>

<L>A Prince's Faults, and I with Reason own.</L>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE Ninth Book.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB N="45" REF="45"/>OBSERVATIONS ON THE NINTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>WE have here a new Scene of Action opened; the Poet has hitherto given us an Account of what happened by Day only: the two following Books relate the Adventures of the Night.</P>
<P>It may be thought that <HI>Homer</HI> has crowded a great many Actions into a very short Time. In the ninth Book a Coun∣cil is conven'd, an Embassy sent, a considerable Time passes in the Speeches and Replies of the Embassadors and <HI>Achilles:</HI> In the tenth Book a second Council is call'd, after this a De∣bate is held, <HI>Dolon</HI> is intercepted, <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> enter into the Enemy's Camp, kill <HI>Rhesus,</HI> and bring away his Hor∣ses: And all this done in the narrow Compass of one Night.</P>
<P>It must therefore be remember'd that the ninth Book takes up the first Part of the Night only; that after the first Council was dissolv'd, there pass'd some time before the second was summon'd, as appears by the Leaders being awa∣kened by <HI>Menelaus.</HI> So that it was almost Morning before <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> set out upon their Design, which is very evident from the Words of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> Book. 10. ℣. 251.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q> <PB N="46" REF="46"/>So that altho' a great many Incidents are introduc'd, yet eve∣ry thing might easily have been perform'd in the allotted Time.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 7. <HI>From</HI> Thracia<HI>'s Shore.</HI>]</Q> <HI>Homer</HI> has been sup∣pos'd by <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> and others, to have been guilty of an Error, in saying that <HI>Zephyrus</HI> or the West Wind blows from <HI>Thrace,</HI> whereas in Truth it blows toward it. But the Poet speaks so either because it is fabled to be the Rendezvous of all the Winds; or with respect to the particular Situation of <HI>Troy</HI> and the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea. Either of these Replies are sufficient to solve that Objection.</P>
<P>The particular Parts of this Comparison agree admirably with the Design of <HI>Homer,</HI> to express the Distraction of the <HI>Greeks:</HI> the two Winds representing the different Opinions of the Armies, one Part of which were inclin'd to return, the other to stay. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 15. <HI>But bid in Silence.</HI>]</Q> The Reason why <HI>Agamem∣non</HI> commands his Heralds to summon the Leaders in Silence, is for fear the Enemy should discover their Consternation, by reason of their Nearness, or perceive what their Designs were in this Extremity. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 23. Agamemnon<HI>'s Speech.</HI>]</Q> The Criticks are divided in their Opinion whether this Speech, which is word for word the same with that he makes in <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. be only a Feint to try the Army, as it is there, or the real Sentiments of the Ge∣neral. <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus</HI> explains it as the former, with whom Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> concurs; she thinks they must be both counterfeit, because they are both the same, and believes <HI>Homer</HI> would have varied them, had the Design been diffe∣rent. She takes no notice that <HI>Eustathius</HI> is of the contrary
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
Opinion; as is also Monsieur <HI>de la Motte,</HI> who argues as if he had read him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Agamemnon</HI> (says he) in the second Iliad thought himself assured of Victory from the Dream which <HI>Jupiter</HI> had sent to him, and in that Confidence was desirous to bring the <HI>Greeks</HI> to a Battel: But in the ninth Book his Circumstances are changed, he is in the utmost Distress and Despair upon his Defeat, and therefore his Proposal to raise the Siege is in all Probability sincere. If <HI>Homer</HI> had intended we should think otherwise, he would have told us so, as he did on the former Occasion; and some of the Officers would have suspected a Feint the ra∣ther, because they had been impos'd upon by the same Speech before. But none of them suspect him at all. <HI>Dio∣med</HI> thinks him so much in earnest as to reproach his Cow∣ardice, <HI>Nestor</HI> applauds <HI>Diomed</HI>'s Liberty, and <HI>Agamemnon</HI> makes not the least Defence for himself.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Dacier</HI> answers, that <HI>Homer</HI> had no Occasion to tell us this was counterfeit, because the Officers could not but remember it to have been so before; and as for the Answers of <HI>Diomed</HI> and <HI>Nestor,</HI> they only carry on the same Feint, as <HI>Dionysius</HI> has prov'd, whose Reasons may be seen in the following Note.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to decide upon this Point; but which way soever it be, I think <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Design was equally answer'd by repeating the same Speech: So that the Repeti∣tion at least is not to be blamed in <HI>Homer.</HI> What obliged <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to that Feint in the second Book was the Hatred he had incurred in the Army by being the Cause of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Departure; this made it but a necessary Precaution in him to try, before he came to a Battel, whether the <HI>Greeks</HI> were dispos'd to it? And it was equally necessary, in case the E∣vent should prove unsuccessful, to free himself from the Odi∣um of being the occasion of it. Therefore when they were now actually defeated, to repeat the same Words, was the readiest way to put them in mind that he had propos'd the same Advice to them before the Battel; and to make it ap∣pear unjust that their ill Fortune should be charged upon him. See the 5<HI>th</HI> and 8<HI>th</HI> Notes on the second Iliad.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 43. <HI>The Speech of</HI> Diomed.]</Q> I shall here translate the Criticism of <HI>Dionysius</HI> on this Passage. He asks, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What can be the Drift of <HI>Diomed,</HI> when he insults <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in his Griefs and Distresses? For what <HI>Diomed</HI> here says seems not only very ill tim'd, but inconsistent with his own Opinion, and with the Respect he had shewn in the be∣ginning of this very Speech.<Q><L>If I upbraid thee, Prince, thy Wrath with-hold,</L>
<L>The Laws of Council bid my Tongue be bold.</L></Q>This is the Introduction of a Man in Temper, who is willing to soften and Excuse the Liberty of what is to fol∣low, and what Necessity only obliges him to utter. But he subjoins a Resentment of the Reproach the King had formerly thrown upon him, and tells him that <HI>Jupiter</HI> had given him Power and Dominion without Courage and Vir∣tue. These are things which agree but ill together, that <HI>Diomed</HI> should upbraid <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in his Adversity with past Injuries, after he had endur'd his Reproaches with so much Moderation, and had reproved <HI>Sthenelus</HI> so warm∣ly for the contrary Practice in the fourth Book. If any one answer, that <HI>Diomed</HI> was warranted in this Freedom by the Bravery of his warlike Behaviour since that Re∣proach, he supposes this Hero very ignorant how to de∣mean himself in Prosperity. The Truth is, this whole Accusation of <HI>Diomed</HI>'s is only a Feint to serve the De∣signs of <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> For being desirous to persuade the <HI>Greeks</HI> against their Departure, he effects that Design by this counterfeited Anger, and License of Speech: And seeming to resent, that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> should be capable of imagining the Army would return to <HI>Greece,</HI> he artificially makes use of these Reproaches to cover his Argument. This is farther confirm'd by what follows, when he bids <HI>Agamemnon</HI> return, if he pleases, and affirms that the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI> will stay without him. Nay he carries the Matter so
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
far, as to boast, that if all the rest should depart, himself and <HI>Sthenelus</HI> alone would continue the War, which would be extremely childish and absurd in any other View than this.</Q></P>

He praises <HI>Diomed</HI> for what he has said, but does it not without de∣claring, that he had not spoken fully to the Purpose, and fallen short in some Points, which he ascribes to his Youth, and promises to supply them. Then after a long Pream∣ble, when he has turn'd himself several ways, as if he was sporting in a new and uncommon Vein of Oratory, he con∣cludes by ordering the Watch to their Stations, and advi∣sing <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to invite the Elders of the Army to a Supper, there, out of many Counsels, to chuse the best. All this at first Sight appears absurd: But we must know that <HI>Nestor</HI> too speaks in Figure. <HI>Diomed</HI> seems to quarrel with <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> purely to gratify him; but <HI>Ne∣stor</HI> praises his Liberty of Speech, as it were to vindicate a real Quarrel with the King. The End of all this is only to move <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to supplicate <HI>Achilles;</HI> and to that End he so much commends the young Man's Freedom. In proposing to call a Council only of the eldest, he con∣sults the Dignity of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> that he might not be expos'd to make this Condescension before the younger Officers. And he concludes by an artful Inference of the absolute Necessity of applying to <HI>Achilles</HI> from the present Posture of their Affairs.<Q><L>See what a Blaze from hostile Tents aspires,</L>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 586. <HI>Despair and Grief distract,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> I have ta∣ken the Liberty to replace here four Verses which <HI>Aristarchus</HI> had cut out, because of the Horror which the Idea gave him of a Son who is going to kill his Father; but perhaps <HI>Ari∣starchus</HI>'s Niceness was too great. These Verses seem to me necessary, and have a very good Effect; for <HI>Phoenix</HI>'s Aim is to shew <HI>Achilles,</HI> that unless we overcome our Wrath, we are expos'd to commit the greatest Crimes: He was going to kill his own Father. <HI>Achilles</HI> in the same manner is going to let his Father <HI>Phoenix</HI> and all the <HI>Greeks</HI> perish, if he does not appease his Wrath. <HI>Plutarch</HI> relates these four Verses in his Treatise of reading the Poets; and adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Aristarchus</HI> frightned at this horrible Crime, cut out these Verses; but they do very well in this Place, and on this Occasion, <HI>Phoenix</HI> intending to shew <HI>Achilles</HI> what Wrath is, and to what abominable Excesses it hurries Men who do not obey Reason, and who refuse to follow the Counsels of those that advise them.</Q> These sort of Curtailings from <HI>Homer,</HI> often contrary to all Reason, gave room to <HI>Lucian</HI> to feign that being in the fortunate Islands, he ask'd <HI>Homer</HI> a great many Questions.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 625. Pray'rs <HI>are</HI> Jove<HI>'s Daughters.</HI>]</Q> Nothing can be more beautiful, noble, or religious, than this divine Alle∣gory. We have here Goddesses of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Creation, he sets before us their Pictures in lively Colours, and gives these fancy'd Beings all the Features that resemble Mankind who offer Injuries, or have Recourse to Prayers.</P>
<P>Prayers are said to be the Daughters of <HI>Jove,</HI> because it is he who teaches Man to pray. They are lame, because the Posture of a Suppliant is with his Knee on the Ground. They are wrinkled, because those that pray have a Countenance of Dejection and Sorrow. Their Eyes are turn'd aside, because thro' an awful Regard to Heaven they dare not lift them thi∣ther. They follow <HI>Ate</HI> or <HI>Injury,</HI> because nothing but Prayers can attone for the Wrongs that are offer'd by the injurious. <HI>Ate</HI> is said to be strong and swift of Foot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because inju∣rious Men are swift to do Mischief. This is the Explanation of <HI>Eustathius,</HI> with whom <HI>Dacier</HI> agrees, but when she allows the Circumstance of Lameness to intimate the Custom of
<PB N="76" REF="76"/>
kneeling in Prayer, she forgets that this contradicts her own Assertion in one of the Remarks on Iliad 7. where she affirms that no such Custom was used by the <HI>Greeks.</HI> And indeed the contrary seems inferred in several Places of <HI>Homer,</HI> par∣ticularly where <HI>Achilles</HI> says in the 608<HI>th</HI> Verse of the eleventh Book, <HI>The</HI> Greeks <HI>shall stand round his Knees supplicating to him.</HI> The Phrases in that Language that signify praying, are deriv'd from the Knee, only as it was usual to lay hold on the Knee of the Person to whom they supplicated.</P>
<P>A modern Author imagines <HI>Ate</HI> to signify <HI>divine Justice,</HI> a Notion in which he is single, and repugnant to all the My∣thologists. Besides, the whole Context in this Place, and the very Application of the Allegory to the present Case of <HI>Achilles,</HI> whom he exhorts to be moved by Prayers notwith∣standing the Injustice done him by <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> makes the con∣trary evident.</P>

is every where of a Piece: He begins to yield, and not to have done so, would not have spoke him a Man; to have made him perfectly inexorable had shewn him a Monster.

Thus <HI>Oedipus</HI> often speaks in <HI>So∣phocles;</HI> and holy Scripture furnishes us with great Examples of Enthusiastick Speeches, which have a double Sense.

Lo faithful <HI>Nestor</HI> thy Command obeys;</L>
<L>The Care is next our other Chiefs to raise:</L>
<L><HI>Ulysses, Diomed</HI> we chiefly need;</L>

<L N="125">Some other be dispatch'd, of nimbler Feet,</L>

<L>To rouse the <HI>Spartan</HI> I my self decree;</L>
<L>Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,</L>

<L>For strong <HI>Necessity</HI> our Toils demands,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>To whom the King: With Rev'rence we allow</L>
<L>Thy just Rebukes, yet learn to spare them now.</L>
<L>My gen'rous Brother is of gentle kind,</L>
<L>He seems remiss, but bears a valiant Mind;</L>
<L N="140">Thro' too much Def'rence to our Sov'reign Sway,</L>
<L>Content to follow when we lead the way.</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="91"/>
But now our Ills industrious to prevent,</L>
<L>Long e'er the rest, he rose, and sought my Tent.</L>
<L>The Chiefs you nam'd, already, at his Call,</L>
<L N="145">Prepare to meet us near the Navy-wall;</L>
<L>Assembling there, between the Trench and Gates,</L>
<L>Near the Night-Guards, our chosen Council waits.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then none (said <HI>Nestor</HI>) shall his Rule withstand,</L>
<L>For great Examples justify Command.</L>
</LG>

<L N="150">With that, the venerable Warrior rose;</L>
<L>The shining Greaves his manly Legs inclose;</L>
<L>His purple Mantle golden Buckles join'd,</L>
<L>Warm with the softest Wool, and doubly lin'd.</L>
<L>Then rushing from his Tent, he snatch'd in hast</L>
<L N="155">His steely Lance, that lighten'd as he past.</L>
<L>The Camp he travers'd thro' the sleeping Crowd,</L>
<L>Stopp'd at <HI>Ulysses'</HI> Tent, and call'd aloud.</L>
<L><HI>Ulysses,</HI> sudden as the Voice was sent,</L>
<L>Awakes, starts up, and issues from his Tent.</L>
<L N="160">What new Distress, what sudden Cause of Fright</L>
<L>Thus leads you wandring in the silent Night?</L>
<L>O prudent Chief! (the <HI>Pylian</HI> Sage reply'd)</L>

Whatever means of Safety can be sought,</L>

<LG>
<L>He heard, return'd, and took his painted Shield:</L>
<L>Then join'd the Chiefs, and follow'd thro' the Field.</L>
<L N="170">Without his Tent, bold <HI>Diomed</HI> they found,</L>
<L>All sheath'd in Arms; his brave Companions round:</L>
<L>Each sunk in Sleep, extended on the Field,</L>
<L>His Head reclining on his bossy Shield.</L>
<L>A Wood of Spears stood by, that fixt upright,</L>
<L N="175">Shot from their flashing Points a quiv'ring Light.</L>
<L>A Bull's black Hide compos'd the Hero's Bed;</L>
<L>A splendid Carpet roll'd beneath his Head.</L>

<L>But now the last Despair surrounds our Host;</L>
<L N="195">No Hour must pass, no Moment must be lost;</L>
<L>Each single <HI>Greek,</HI> in this conclusive Strife,</L>

<L N="200">Succeed to these my Cares, and rouze the rest;</L>

<LG>
<L>This said, the Hero o'er his Shoulders slung</L>

<L>And now the Chiefs approach the nightly Guard;</L>
<L>A wakeful Squadron, each in Arms prepar'd:</L>
<L>Th' unweary'd Watch their list'ning Leaders keep,</L>
<L N="210">And couching close, repell invading Sleep.</L>
<L>So faithful Dogs their fleecy Charge maintain,</L>
<L>With Toil protected from the prowling Train;</L>
<L>When the gaunt Lioness, with Hunger bold,</L>
<L>Springs from the Mountains tow'rd the guarded Fold:</L>
<L N="215">Thro'breaking Woods her rust'ling Course they hear;</L>
<L>Loud, and more loud, the Clamours strike their Ear</L>
<L>Of Hounds and Men; they start, they gaze around;</L>
<L>Watch ev'ry Side, and turn to ev'ry Sound.</L>
<L>Thus watch'd the <HI>Grecians,</HI> cautious of Surprize,</L>
<L N="220">Each Voice, each Motion, drew their Ears and Eyes;</L>
<L>Each Step of passing Feet increas'd th'Affright;</L>
<L>And hostile <HI>Troy</HI> was ever full in Sight.</L>
<L><HI>Nestor</HI> with Joy the wakeful Band survey'd,</L>

<L N="225">'Tis well, my Sons, your nightly Cares employ,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is there (he said) a Chief so greatly brave,</L>
<L>His Life to hazard, and his Country save?</L>
<L>Lives there a Man, who singly dares to go</L>

<L N="245">Or favour'd by the Night, approach so near,</L>
<L>Their Speech, their Counsels, and Designs to hear?</L>
<L>If to besiege our Navies they prepare,</L>

<L>This could he learn, and to our Peers recite,</L>

What Fame were his thro' all succeeding Days,</L>
<L>While <HI>Phoebus</HI> shines, or Men have tongues to praise?</L>
<L>What Gifts his grateful Country would bestow?</L>
<L>What must not <HI>Greece</HI> to her Deliv'rer owe?</L>
<L N="255">A sable Ewe each Leader should provide,</L>
<L>With each a sable Lambkin by her side;</L>
<L>At ev'ry Rite his Share should be increas'd,</L>
<L>And his the foremost Honours of the Feast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fear held them mute: Alone, untaught to fear,</L>
<L N="260"><HI>Tydides</HI> spoke—The Man you seek, is here.</L>
<L>Thro' yon' black Camps to bend my dang'rous way,</L>
<L>Some God within commands, and I obey.</L>
<L>But let some other chosen Warrior join,</L>
<L>To raise my Hopes, and second my Design.</L>
<L N="265">By mutual Confidence, and mutual Aid,</L>
<L>Great Deeds are done, and great Discov'ries made;</L>
<L>The Wise new Prudence from the Wise acquire,</L>
<L>And one brave Hero fans another's Fire.</L>

<LG>
<L>Contending Leaders at the Word arose;</L>
<L N="270">Each gen'rous Breast with Emulation glows:</L>

<L>Bold <HI>Merion</HI> strove, and <HI>Nestor</HI>'s valiant Heir;</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="97"/>
The <HI>Spartan</HI> wish'd the second Place to gain,</L>

<L>Just be thy Choice, without Affection made,</L>

<L>Then thus (the Godlike <HI>Diomed</HI> rejoin'd)</L>
<L>My Choice declares the Impulse of my Mind.</L>
<L>How can I doubt, while great <HI>Ulysses</HI> stands</L>
<L N="285">To lend his Counsels, and assist our Hands?</L>
<L>A Chief, whose Safety is <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Care;</L>
<L>So fam'd, so dreadful, in the Works of War?</L>
<L>Blest in his Conduct, I no Aid require,</L>

<L N="290">It fits thee not, before these Chiefs of Fame,</L>

But let us haste—Night rolls the Hours away,</L>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 27. <HI>He rose, and first he cast his Mantle round.</HI>]</Q> I fancy it will be entertaining to the Reader to observe how well the Poet at all times suits the Descriptions to the Cir∣cumstances of the Persons: We must remember that this Book continues the Actions of one Night; the whole Army is now asleep, and the Poet takes this Opportunity to give us a Description of several of his Heroes suitable to their proper Characters. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> who is every where describ'd as anxious for the Good of his People, is kept awake by a fatherly Care for their Preservation. <HI>Menelaus,</HI> for whose sake the <HI>Greeks</HI> had suffer'd so greatly, shares all their Mis∣fortunes, and is restless while they are in danger. <HI>Nestor,</HI> a provident, wise old Man, sacrifices his Rest even in the Ex∣tremity of Age, to his Love for his Country. <HI>Ulysses,</HI> a Per∣son next to <HI>Nestor</HI> in Wisdom, is ready at the first Summons; he finds it hard, while the <HI>Greeks</HI> suffer, to compose him∣self to Sleep, but is easily awak'd to march to its Defence: But <HI>Diomed,</HI> who is every where describ'd as a daring War∣rior, sleeps unconcern'd at the Nearness of the Enemy, and is not awaked without some Violence: He is said to be asleep, but he sleeps like a Soldier in compleat Arms.</P>
<P>I could not pass over one Circumstance in this Place in Relation to <HI>Nestor.</HI> It is a Pleasure to see what Care the Poet takes of his favourite Councellor: He describes him ly∣ing
<PB N="122" REF="120"/>
in a soft Bed, wraps him up in a warm Cloak, to preserve his Age from the Coldness of the Night; but <HI>Diomed,</HI> a gallant young Hero, sleeps upon the Ground in open Air; and indeed every Warrior is dress'd in Arms peculiar to that Season: The Hide of a Lion or Leopard is what they all put on, being not to engage an Enemy, but to meet their Friends in Council. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 43. <HI>Sends he some Spy?</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> <HI>Menelaus</HI> in this Place starts a Design which is afterwards proposed by <HI>Nestor</HI> in Council; the Poet knew that the Project would come with greater Weight from the Age of the one, than from the Youth of the other: and that the Valiant would be ready to execute a Design, which so venerable a Counsellor had form'd. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 57. <HI>Such wondrous Deeds as</HI> Hector<HI>'s Hand,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> We hear <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in this Place launching into the Praises of a gallant Enemy; but if any one think that he raises the Actions of <HI>Hector</HI> too high, and sets him above <HI>Achilles</HI> him∣self, this Objection will vanish if he considers that he com∣mends him as the bravest of mere Men, but still he is not equal to <HI>Achilles</HI> who was descended from a Goddess. <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> undoubtedly had <HI>Achilles</HI> in his Thoughts when he says,
<Q><L>Sprung from no God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
But his Anger will not let him even name the Man whom he thus obliquely praises.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> proceeds to observe, that the Poet ascribes the gallant Exploits of <HI>Hector</HI> to his Piety; and had he not been favour'd by <HI>Jove,</HI> he had not been thus victorious.</P>
<P>He also remarks that there is a double Tautology in this Speech of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> as <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and
<PB N="123" REF="121"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. This proceeds from the Wonder which the King endeavours to express at the Greatness of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Actions: He labours to make his Words answer the great Idea he had conceiv'd of them, and while his Mind dwells upon the same Object, he falls into the same manner of expressing it. This is very natural to a Person in his Circumstances, whose Thoughts are as it were pent up, and struggle for an Utterance.</P>

He seems to be under some Apprehension lest he should have remitted the Watch. And it may also be gather'd from this Passage, that in those Times the Use of the Watch-word was unknown; because <HI>Nestor</HI> is oblig'd to crowd several Questions together, before he can learn whether <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> be a Friend or an Enemy. The Shortness of the Questions agrees admirably with the Occasion upon which they were made; it being necessary that <HI>Nestor</HI> should be im∣mediately inform'd who he was who pass'd along the Camp: If a Spy, that he might stand upon his Guard; if a Friend, that he might not cause an Alarm to be given to the Army, by multiplying Questions. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<HI>Didymus,</HI> that <HI>Homer</HI> meant the Space which Mules by their Swiftness gain upon Oxen that plow in the same Field. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>Grecians</HI> (says she) did not plow in the manner now in use.

When they em∣ployed two Plows in a Field, they measured the Space they could Plow in a Day, and set their Plows at the two ends of that Space, and those Plows proceeded toward each o∣ther. This intermediate Space was constantly fix'd, but less in Proportion for two Plows of Oxen than for two of Mules; because Oxen are slower and toil more in a Field that has not been yet turn'd up, whereas Mules are natu∣rally swifter, and make greater speed in a Ground that has already had the first Plowing.

<P>I cannot conclude the Notes to this Book without obser∣ving, that what seems the principal Beauty of it, and what distinguishes it among all the others, is the Liveliness of its Paintings: The Reader sees the most natural Night-Scene in the World; he is led step by step with the Adventurers, and made the Companion of all their Expectations, and Uncertain∣ties. We see the very Colour of the Sky, know the Time to a Minute, are impatient while the Heroes are arming, our Imagination steals out after them, becomes privy to all their Doubts, and even to the secret Wishes of their Hearts sent up to <HI>Minerva.</HI> We are alarmed at the Approach of <HI>Dolon,</HI> hear his very Footsteps, assist the two Chiefs in pursuing him, and stop just with the Spear that arrests him. We are per∣fectly acquainted with the Situation of all the Forces, with the Figure in which they lie, with the Disposition of <HI>Rhesus</HI> and the <HI>Thracians,</HI> with the Posture of his Chariot and Horses. The marshy Spot of Ground where <HI>Dolon</HI> is killed, the Ta∣marisk, or aquatic Plants upon which they hang his Spoils, and the Reeds that are heap'd together to mark the Place, are Circumstances the most Picturesque imaginable. And tho' it must be owned, that the human Figures in this Piece are excellent, and disposed in the properest Actions; I cannot but confess my Opinion, that the chief Beauty of it is in the Prospect, a finer than which was never drawn by any Pencil.</P>

<HEAD><PB N="191" REF="188"/>OBSERVATIONS ON THE ELEVENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Homer</HI>'s Invention is in nothing more wonderful than in the great Variety of Characters with which his Poems are diversify'd, so his Judgment appears in nothing more exact, than in that Propriety with which each Character is maintain'd. But this Exactness must be collected by a diligent Attention to his Conduct thro' the whole: and when the Particulars of each Character are laid together, we shall find them all proceeding from the same Temper and Disposition of the Person. If this Observation be neglected, the Poet's Conduct will lose much of its true Beauty and Harmony.</P>
<P>I fancy it will not be unpleasant to the Reader, to consider the Picture of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> drawn by so masterly an Hand as that of <HI>Homer</HI> in its full length, after having seen him in several Views and Lights since the beginning of the Poem.</P>
<P>He is a Master of Policy and Stratagem, and maintains a good Understanding with his Council; which was but necessary considering how many different and independent Nations and Interests he had to manage: He seems fully conscious of his own superior Authority, and always knows the time when to exert it: He is personally very valiant, but not without some Mixture of Fierceness: Highly resentful of the Injuries done
<PB N="192" REF="189"/>
his Family, even more than <HI>Menelaus</HI> himself: Warm both in his Passions and Affections, particularly in the Love he bears his Brother. In short, he is (as <HI>Homer</HI> himself in ano∣ther Place describes him) both a good King, and a great Warrior.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q> It is very observable how this Hero rises in the Eye and E∣steem of the Reader as the Poem advances: It opens with many Circumstances very much to the Disadvantage of his Character; he insults the Priest of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and outrages <HI>Achilles:</HI> but in the second Book he grows sensible of the Ef∣fects of his Rashness, and takes the Fault entirely upon him∣self: In the fourth he shews himself a skilful Commander, by exhorting, reproving and performing all the Offices of a good General: In the eighth he is deeply touch'd by the Sufferings of his Army, and makes all the Peoples Calamities his own: In the ninth he endeavours to reconcile himself to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and condescends to be the Petitioner, because it is for the publick Good: In the tenth, finding those Endea∣vours ineffectual, his Concern keeps him the whole Night awake, in contriving all possible Methods to assist them: And now in the eleventh as it were resolving himself to supply the want of <HI>Achilles,</HI> he grows prodigiously in his Valour, and performs Wonders in his single Person.</P>
<P>Thus we see <HI>Agamemnon</HI> continually winning upon our E∣steem, as we grow acquainted with him; so that he seems to be like that Goddess the Poet describes, who was low at the first, but rising by degrees, at last reaches the very Heavens.</P>

<P>By the Goddess <HI>Eris</HI> is meant that Ardour and Impatience for the Battel which now inspir'd the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army: They who just before were almost in Despair, now burn for the Fight, and breath nothing but War. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

But to deliver my Opinion, I believe it was the Nearness of the Enemy that obliged <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to change the Disposition of the Battel: He would break their Battalions with his Infantry, and com∣plete their Defeat by his Cavalry, which should fall upon the Flyers. <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>

Nothing is more common in History than Showers of Blood, and Philosophy gives us the Reason of them: The two Battels which had been fought on the Plains of <HI>Troy,</HI> had so drench'd them with Blood, that a great Quantity of it might be ex∣hal'd in Vapours and carry'd into the Air, and being there condens'd, fall down again in Dews and Drops of the same Colour. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

By this means they rais'd an Emulati∣on between both Parties, which should finish their Share first. If we consider this Custom, we shall find it a very happy Com∣parison to the two Armies advancing against each other, to∣gether with an exact Resemblance in every Circumstance the Poet intended to illustrate.</P>

<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 119. <HI>What time in some sequester'd Vale The weary Woodman,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> One may gather from hence, that in <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>'s Time they did not measure the Day by Hours, but by the Progression of the Sun; and distinguish'd the Parts of it by the most noted Employments; as in the 12 of the <HI>Odysseis,</HI> ℣. 439. from the rising of the Judges, and here from the dining of the Labourer.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be entertaining to the Reader to see a ge∣neral Account of the Mensuration of Time among the Anci∣ents, which I shall take from <HI>Spondanus.</HI> At the beginning of the World it is certain there was no Distinction of Time but by the Light and Darkness, and the whole Day was included in the general Terms of the Evening and the Morning. <HI>Mun∣ster</HI> makes a pretty Observation upon this Custom: Our long∣liv'd Forefathers (says he) had not so much occasion to be exact Observers how the Day pass'd, as their frailer Sons, whose Shortness of Life makes it necessary to distinguish every Part of Time, and suffer none of it to slip away without their Ob∣servation.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="193"/>
It is not improbable but that the <HI>Chaldaeans,</HI> many Ages after the Flood, were the first who divided the Day into Hours; they being the first who applied themselves with any Success to Astrology. The most ancient Sun-dial we read of is that of <HI>Achaz,</HI> mention'd in the second Book of Kings, Ch. 20. about the Time of the building of <HI>Rome:</HI> But as these were of no use on clouded Days and in the Night; there was another Invention of measuring the Parts of Time by Water; but that not being sufficiently exact, they laid it a∣side for another by Sand.</P>
<P>'Tis certain the Use of Dials was earlier among the <HI>Greeks</HI> than the <HI>Romans;</HI> 'twas above three hundred Years after the building of <HI>Rome</HI> before they knew any thing of them: But yet they had divided the Day and Night into twenty four Hours, as appears from <HI>Varro</HI> and <HI>Macrobius,</HI> tho' they did not count the Hours as we do, numerically, but from Midnight to Mid∣night, and distinguish'd them by particular Names, as by the Cock crowing, the Dawn, the Midday, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The first Sun-dial we read of among the <HI>Romans</HI> which divided the Day into Hours, is mention'd by <HI>Pliny, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 20. fixt upon the Temple of <HI>Quirinus</HI> by <HI>L. Papyrius</HI> the Censor, about the 12<HI>th</HI> Year of the Wars with <HI>Pyrrhus.</HI> But the first that was of any Use to the Publick was set up near the <HI>Rostra</HI> in the <HI>Forum</HI> by <HI>Valerius Messala</HI> the Consul, after the taking of <HI>Catana</HI> in <HI>Sicily;</HI> from whence it was brought thirty Years after the first had been set up by <HI>Papyrius;</HI> but this was still an imper∣fect one, the Lines of it not exactly corresponding with the several Hours. Yet they made use of it many Years, till <HI>Q. Marcius Philippus</HI> placed another by it greatly improved: but these had still one common Defect of being useless in the Night, and when the Skies were overcast. All these In∣ventions being thus ineffectual, <HI>Scipio Nasica</HI> some Years af∣terwards measur'd the Day and Night into Hours from the dropping of Water.</P>
<P>Yet near this time, it may be gather'd that Sun-dials were very frequent in <HI>Rome,</HI> from a Fragment preserv'd by <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI> and ascrib'd to <HI>Plautus:</HI> The Lines are so beau∣tiful, that I cannot deny the Reader the Satisfaction of seeing them. They are supposed to be spoken by an hungry Para∣site,

other. For in that, after so solemn an Invocation, we might reasonably have expected Wonders from the Hero: whereas in Reality he kills but one Man before he himself is wounded; and what he does afterwards seems to proceed from a frantic Valour, arising from the Smart of the Wound: We do not find by the Text that he kills one Man, but over∣throws several in his Fury, and then retreats: So that one would imagine he invoked the Muses only to describe his Retreat.</P>
<P>But upon a nearer view, we shall find that <HI>Homer</HI> shews a commendable Partiality to his own Countryman and Hero <HI>Agamemnon:</HI> He seems to detract from the Greatness of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Actions, by ascribing them to <HI>Jupiter;</HI> whereas <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> conquers by the Dint of Bravery: And that this is a just Observation, will appear by what follows.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 637. <HI>A wise Physician.</HI>]</Q> The Poet passes a very signal Commendation upon Physicians: The Army had seen several of the bravest of their Heroes wounded, yet were not so much dispirited for them all, as they were at the single Danger of <HI>Machaon:</HI> But the Person whom he calls a Phy∣sician, seems rather to be a Surgeon. The cutting out of Arrows, and applying Anodynes being the Province of the latter: However (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> says) we must conclude that <HI>Machaon</HI> was both a Physician and Surgeon, and that those two Professions were practised by one Person.</P>
<P>It is reasonable to think from the Frequency of their Wars, that the Profession in those Days was chiefly Chirurgical: <HI>Celsus</HI> says expressly that the <HI>Diaetetic</HI> was long after invented; but that <HI>Botany</HI> was in great Esteem and Practice, appears from the Stories of <HI>Medea, Circe,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>This whole Passage is inimitably just and beautiful, we see <HI>Ajax</HI> drawn in the most bold and strong Colours, and in a manner alive in the Description.

He compares him first to the Lion for his Undauntedness in Fighting, and then to the Ass for his stubborn Slowness in retreating; tho' in the latter Comparison there are many other Points of Like∣ness that enliven the Image: The Havock he makes in the Field is represented by the tearing and trampling down the Harvests; and we see the Bulk, Strength, and Obstinacy of the Hero, when the <HI>Trojans</HI> in respect to him are compared but to Troops of Boys that impotently endeavour to drive him away.</P>

This alone is Conviction to me that they are all of a later Date: For else he would not have fail'd to have vindica∣ted his favourite Poet in a Passage that had been applauded many hundreds of Years, and stood the Test of Ages.</P>
<P>But Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> has done it very well in his Remarks upon <HI>Aristotle.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the time of <HI>Homer</HI> (says that Author) an Ass was not in such Circumstances of Contempt as in ours: The Name of that Animal was not then converted into a Term of Reproach, but it was a Beast upon which Kings and Princes might be seen with Dignity.

It is answer'd by Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> that what <HI>Homer</HI> here images is not the Gluttony; but the Pati∣ence, the Obstinacy, and Strength of the Ass (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> had before observ'd.) To judge rightly of Comparisons, we are not to examine if the Subject from whence they are de∣riv'd be great or little, noble or familiar; but we are prin∣cipally to consider if the Image produc'd be clear and lively, if the Poet has the Skill to dignify it by poetical Words, and if it perfectly paints the thing it is intended to represent. A Company of Boys whipping a Top is very far from a great and noble Subject, yet <HI>Virgil</HI> has not scrupled to draw from it a Similitude which admirably expresses a Princess in the Vi∣olence of her Passion.<Q><L>Ceu quondam torto volitans sub verbere turbo,</L>

The Reason where∣of is, that all the World are not capable to judge of the Justness and Force of a Thought; but there's scarce a∣ny Man who cannot, especially in a living Language, per∣ceive the least Meanness of Words. Nevertheless very few Writers are free from this Vice: <HI>Longinus</HI> accuses <HI>Herodo∣tus,</HI> the most polite of all the <HI>Greek</HI> Historians, of this Defect; and <HI>Livy, Salust,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have not escaped the same Censure.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 779. <HI>Yet heav'd with ease by him.</HI>]</Q> There has e∣ver been a great Dispute about this Passage; nor is it appa∣rent for what Reason the Poet should tell us that <HI>Nestor</HI> even in his old Age could more easily lift this Bowl than any other Man. This has drawn a great deal of Raillery upon the old Man, as if he had learnt to lift it by frequent Use, an Insi∣nuation that <HI>Nestor</HI> was no Enemy to Wine. Others with more Justice to his Character have put another Construction upon the Words, which solves the Improbability very natu∣rally. According to this Opinion the word which is usually supposed to signify <HI>another Man,</HI> is render'd <HI>another old Man,</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="212"/>
meaning <HI>Machaon,</HI> whose Wound made him incapable to lift it. This would have taken away the Difficulty without any Violence to the Construction.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 782. <HI>Pours a large Potion.</HI>]</Q> The Potion which <HI>Hecamede</HI> here prepares for <HI>Machaon,</HI> has been thought a very extraordinary one in the Case of a wounded Person, and by some Criticks held in the same Degree of Repute with the <HI>Balsam of Fierabras</HI> in <HI>Don Quizot.</HI> But it is rightly observed by the Commentators, that <HI>Machaon</HI> was not so dangerously hurt, as to be obliged to a different Re∣gimen from what he might use at another time. <HI>Homer</HI> had just told us that he stay'd on the Sea-side to refresh him∣self, and he now enters into a long Conversation with <HI>Nestor;</HI> neither of which would have been done by a Man in any great Pain or Danger: His Loss of Blood and Spirits might make him not so much in fear of a Feaver, as in want of a Cordial; and accordingly this Potion is rather alimentary than medicinal. If it had been directly improper in this Case, I cannot help fancying that <HI>Homer</HI> would not have fail'd to tell us of <HI>Machaon</HI>'s rejecting it. Yet after all, some Answer may be made even to the grand Objection, that Wine was too inflammatory for a wounded Man. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> allows Wine in acute Cases, and even without Water in Cases of In∣digestion. He says indeed in his Book of ancient Medicine, that the Ancients were ignorant both of the good and bad Qualities of Wine: and yet the Potion here prescrib'd will not be allow'd by Physicians to be an Instance that they were so; for Wine might be proper for <HI>Machaon</HI> not only as a Cordial, but as an <HI>Opiate. Asclepiades,</HI> a Physician who flourish'd at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Time of <HI>Pompey,</HI> prescribed Wine in Feavers, and even in Phrenzies to cause Sleep. <HI>Caelius Au∣relianus, lib.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 14.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 801. <HI>Can then the Sons of</HI> Greece, &amp;c.]</Q> It is cu∣stomary with those who translate or comment on an Author, to use him as they do their Mistress; they can see no Faults, or rather convert his very Faults into Beauties; but I cannot be so partial to <HI>Homer,</HI> as to imagine that this Speech of <HI>Nestor</HI>'s is not greatly blameable for being too long: He crouds Incident upon Incident, and when he speaks of him∣self, he expatiates upon his own great Actions, very natu∣rally indeed to old Age, but unseasonably in the present Jun∣cture. When he comes to speak of his killing the Son of <HI>Augeas,</HI> he is so pleas'd with himself, that he forgets the Distress of the Army, and cannot leave his favourite Subject till he has given us the Pedigree of his Relations, his Wife's Name, her Excellence, the Command he bore, and the Fury with which he assaulted him. These and many other Circumstances, as they have no visible Allusion to the Design of the Speech, seem to be unfortunately introduc'd. In short, I think they are not so valuable upon any other Account, as because they preserve a Piece of ancient History, which had otherwise been lost.</P>
<P>What tends yet farther to make this Story seem absurd, is what <HI>Patroclus</HI> said at the beginning of the Speech, that he <HI>had not leisure even to sit down;</HI> so that <HI>Nestor</HI> detains him in the Tent standing, during the whole Narration.</P>
<P>They that are of the contrary Opinion observe, that there is a great deal of Art in some Branches of the Discourse; that when <HI>Nestor</HI> tells <HI>Patroclus</HI> how he had himself disobey'd his Father's Commands for the sake of his Country, he says it to make <HI>Achilles</HI> reflect that he disobeys his Father by the contrary Behaviour: That what he did himself was to retaliate a small Injury, but <HI>Achilles</HI> by fighting may save the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army. He mentions the Wound of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> at the very beginning, with an Intent to give <HI>Achilles</HI> a little Re∣venge, and that he may know how much his greatest Enemy has suffer'd by his Absence. There are many other Argu∣ments brought in the Defence of particular Parts; and it
<PB N="217" REF="214"/>
may not be from the Purpose to observe, that <HI>Nestor</HI> might designedly protract the Speech, that <HI>Patroclus</HI> might himself behold the Distress of the Army: Thus every Moment he detain'd him, enforced his Arguments, by the growing Mis∣fortunes of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Whether this was the Intention or not, it must be allowed that the Stay of <HI>Patroclus</HI> was very happy for the <HI>Greeks;</HI> for by this means he met <HI>Eurypylus</HI> wounded, who confirm'd him into a Certainty that their Af∣fairs were desperate, without <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Aid.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Nestor</HI>'s second Story, it is much easier to be de∣fended; it tends directly to the Matter in hand, and is told in such a manner as to affect both <HI>Patroclus</HI> and <HI>Achilles;</HI> the Circumstances are well adapted to the Person to whom they are spoken, and by repeating their Father's Instructi∣ons, he as it were brings them in, seconding his Admo∣nitions.</P>

<P>IT may be proper here to take a general View of the Con∣duct of the Iliad: The whole Design turns upon the Wrath of <HI>Achilles:</HI> that Wrath is not to be appeas'd but by the Calamities of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who are taught by their frequent Defeats the Importance of this Hero: For in Epic, as in Tragic Poetry, there ought to be some evident and necessary Incident at the winding up of the Catastrophe, and that should be founded upon some visible Distress. This Conduct has an admirable Effect, not only as it gives an Air of Probability to the Relation, by allowing Leisure to the Wrath of <HI>Achilles</HI> to cool and die away by degrees, (who is every where describ'd as a Person of a stubborn Resentment, and consequently ought not to be easily reconcil'd) but also as it highly contributes to the Honour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which was to be fully satisfy'd, before he could relent.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 15. <HI>Then</HI> Neptune <HI>and</HI> Apollo, &amp;c.]</Q> This whole Episode of the Destruction of the Wall is spoken as a kind of Prophecy, where <HI>Homer</HI> in a poetical Enthusiasm re∣lates what was to happen in future Ages. It has been con∣jectur'd from hence that our Author flourish'd not long after the <HI>Trojan</HI> War; for had he lived at a greater Distance, there had been no occasion to have Recourse to such extraor∣dinary means to destroy a Wall, which would have been lost and worn away by Time alone. <HI>Homer</HI> (says <HI>Aristotle</HI>) fore∣saw the Question might be ask'd, how it came to pass that no Ruins remain'd of so great a Work? and therefore con∣trived to give his Fiction the nearest Resemblance to Truth. Inundations and Earthquakes are sufficient to abolish the strongest Works of Man, so as not to leave the least Re∣mains where they stood. But we are told this in a manner wonderfully noble and poetical: We see <HI>Apollo</HI> turning the Course of the Rivers against the Wall, <HI>Jupiter</HI> opening the Cataracts of Heaven, and <HI>Neptune</HI> rending the Foundations with his Trident: That is, the Sun exhales the Vapours, which descend in Rain from the Air or <HI>Aether,</HI> this Rain causes an Inundation, and that Inundation overturns the Wall. Thus the Poetry of <HI>Homer,</HI> like Magick, first raises a stupendous Object, and then immediately causes it to vanish.</P>
<P>What farther strengthens the Opinion, that <HI>Homer</HI> was particularly careful to avoid the Objection which those of his own Age might raise against the Probability of this Fiction, is, that the Verses which contain this Account of the De∣struction of the Wall seem to be added and interpolated af∣ter the first writing of the Iliad, by <HI>Homer</HI> himself. I believe the Reader will incline to my Opinion, if he considers the manner in which they are introduced, both here, and in the seventh Book, where first this Wall is mention'd. There, describing how it was made, he ends with this Line,<Q><PB N="255" REF="250"/><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q> After which is inserted the Debate of the Gods concerning the Method of its Destruction, at the Conclusion whereof immediately follows a Verse that seems exactly to connect with the former,<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q> In like manner in the present Book, after the fourth Verse,<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q> That which is now the thirty sixth, seems originally to have follow'd.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q> And all the Lines between (which break the Course of the Narration, and are introduced in a manner not usual in <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>) seem to have been added for the Reason above-said. I do not insist much upon this Observation, but I doubt not several will agree to it upon a Review of the Passages.</P>

<P>The Poet here breaks the Thread of his Narration, and stops to give us the Names of the Leaders of every Bat∣talion: By this Conduct he prepares us for an Action en∣tirely new, and different from any other in the Poem. <HI>Eu∣stathius.</HI></P>

He therefore softens every Expression, and endeavours to flat∣ter <HI>Hector</HI> into an Assent; and tho' he is assured he gives a true Interpretation of the Prodigy, he seems to be diffident; but that his personated Distrust may not prejudice the Inter∣pretation, he concludes with a plain Declaration of his Opi∣nion, and tells him that what he delivers is not Conjecture, but Science, and appeals for the Truth of it to the Augurs of the Army. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

It may seem at the first View that <HI>Hector</HI> uses <HI>Polydamas</HI> with too much Severity in the Conclusion of his Speech: But he will be sufficiently justify'd, if we consider that the Inter∣pretation of the Omen given by <HI>Polydamas</HI> might have dis∣courag'd the Army; and this makes it necessary for him to decry the Prediction, and insinuate that the Advice pro∣ceeded not from his Skill but his Cowardice. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
