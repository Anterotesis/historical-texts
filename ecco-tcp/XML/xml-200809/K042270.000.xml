<P>THE PERPLEXITIES: A COMEDY.</P>
<P>As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN <HI>COVENT-GARDEN.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor of this Comedy thinks it his duty to declare that, in point of fable, he is entirely indebted to an old play, wrote by <HI>Sir Samuel Tuke,</HI> called the <HI>Adven∣tures of Five Hours;</HI> of which piece <HI>Echard,</HI> in the preface to his translation of <HI>Terence,</HI> after noticing some particular excellencies, gives this general character; viz.</P>
<Q>This is one of the pleasantest stories, that ever appeared upon our stage, and has as much variety of plots and intrigues, without any thing being precipitated, im∣proper, or unnatural, as to the main action.</Q>
<P>This encomium, and the request of a par∣ticular friend, induced an attempt to restore so excellent a story to the stage. Finding, on examination of the original, the language to consist entirely of measure and rhyme, a style by no means suited to the use of come∣dy, it appeared indispensably necessary to <HI>new-write</HI> it. This arduous task was not undertaken without much fear and diffidence. If the piece, as it now stands, should be for∣tunate enough to meet the least favour, the editor will, with the utmost readiness, charge such success to his having, in <HI>general,</HI> adhered closely to the <HI>Original,</HI> pursued the
<PB REF="3"/>
same disposition of scenery, and preserved as many of the sentiments as could be intro∣duced, without clogging, or interrupting the action. What <HI>particular</HI> alterations he has presumed to make, are, with great deference, submitted to the Candour of the Public.</P>
<P>Since the copy was delivered to the press, some few passages have been shortened in representation, which are easily distinguish∣able by the attentive reader.</P>
<P>⁂ This Comedy having been treated with very distinguished marks of candour and encouragement, in the representation, the Editor thinks it his duty to return his most grateful thanks to the Public.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Mr. BEARD enters hastily.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>I Speak a Prologue!—What strange whim, I wonder,</L>
<L>Could lead the author into such a blunder?—</L>
<L>I ask'd the man as much—but he (poor devil!)</L>
<L>Fancied a Manager might make you civil.</L>
<L><HI>"Garrick</HI> (says he) can with a Prologue tame</L>
<L>"The Critic's rage—Why can't you do the same?"</L>
<L>Because (quoth I) the case is diff'rent quite;</L>
<L><HI>Garrick,</HI> you know, can Prologues speak, and write;</L>
<L>If like that <HI>Roscius</HI> I could write, and speech it,</L>
<L>I might command applause, and not beseech it.</L>
<L>But, sure, for one who, all his live-long days,</L>
<L>Has dealt in Crotchets, Minims, and Sol-fa's,</L>
<L>A Singer, to stand forth in Wit's defence,</L>
<L>And plead 'gainst Sound the solemn cause of Sense;</L>
<L>Persuade an audience that a play has merit,</L>
<L>Without a single Air to give it spirit;</L>
<L>'Tis so much out of character—so wrong—</L>
<L>No Prologue, sir, for me,—unless in Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fame (quoth I) you poets reap,</L>
<L>And all your gains, are owing,</L>
<L>To sounds that even measure keep,</L>
<L>And stanzas smoothly flowing:</L>
<L>But me the lyre wou'd better suit</L>
<L>Than verses of Apollo;</L>
<L>The fiddle, hautboy, horn, or flute,</L>
<L>I'm always us'd to follow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Sir (says he) you'll mar</L>
<L>"My verse and meaning too"—</L>
<L>Sir, must I turn fool,</L>
<L>To humour such as you?</L>
<L>I'll sing it if you please—</L>
<L>"Sing! cries he, in huff,</L>
<L>"Of you and your Sol-fa's</L>
<L>"The town has had enough"—</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
Oh! then I bounc'd and swore—</L>
<L>Was I much to blame?</L>
<L>Had you been in my place,</L>
<L>Why you'd have done the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If for old-fashion'd tunes he's not too nice,</L>
<L>I'd give him fifty of 'em in a trice,</L>
<L>With words more fitted to his purpose here,</L>
<L>Than all the rhimes he'd jingle in a year.</L>
<L>He challeng'd me to shew a single sample</L>
<L>Of what I bragg'd—I did—as for example!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The scene is prepar'd, the Critics are met,</L>
<L>The judges all rang'd—a terrible shew!</L>
<L>E're tryal begins the Prologue's a debt,</L>
<L>A debt on demand—so take what we owe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And this is the way, Mr. Author,</L>
<L>To trick a plain muse up with art,</L>
<L>In modish Fal-lal's you must cloathe her,</L>
<L>And warm a cold Critic's hard heart.</L>
<L>With a Fal-lal-lal, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wherefore I thus entreat, with due submission,</L>
<L>Between the bard and me you'd make decision.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The whole now on your arbitration we rest,</L>
<L>And Prologues henceforward shall surely be drest,</L>
<L>In what mode soever your taste shall like best,</L>
<L>Which none of us dare deny.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For, howe'er cruel critics and witlings may sneer,</L>
<L>That at times I, alas! somewhat <HI>dunny</HI> appear,</L>
<L>If to you, my best friends, I e'er <HI>turn my deaf ear,</HI></L>
<L>May you your indulgence deny!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, for his sake and mine, (for we're both in a fright)</L>
<L>Till a treat of more goût shall your palates delight,</L>
<L>Let a poor humble Comedy please you to-night;</L>
<L>Which surely you will not deny.</L>

<HEAD>ACT I. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, <HI>Don</HI> HENRIQUEZ, <HI>and Don</HI> JUAN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRIQUEZ.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO more, cousin, I beseech you; all your rhetoric will not persuade me to leave so important a care, as the honour of our family, to the caprice of a giddy girl. It was a charge committed absolutely to me, by our pa∣rents, on their death-bed, and I alone must be answerable for any blemish on that honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt, Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> but that this your extreme haste takes it's rise from pru∣dence; but may not even our virtues be sometimes overstrain'd, and have their dangerous effects?
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
'Tis from this fear, that I have often presum'd to interpose, and must repeat it; wou'd it not be better to let your sister see, and make herself acquainted with the disposition of, the man with whom she is to pass her life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is, in other words, to give her more opportunity for devices, and to try whether she cannot frustrate my designs—no, no,—an agreeable young girl shou'd never be left to her own direction;—tricks, plots, and contrivances are so innate in them, they will couzen themselves rather than their imaginations shou'd want em∣ployment; I have seen too many instances of their vanity, giddiness, ingratitude; well—well!—I have, within this hour, receiv'd intelligence from the Marquis <HI>d'Olivera,</HI> thro' whose generous inter∣vention my designs are, at last, come to maturity, that the person, to whom she has been so long contracted, Don <HI>Antonio de Mendoza—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he the man? The very name removes half my objections. Why has it been so long concealed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I wou'd not give my sister's enter∣prising genius either time, or means, to counter∣act my purposes—but now, the prospect of a speedy conclusion of the whole affair renders that secrecy no longer necessary; this evening he will arrive from <HI>Flanders;</HI> and so well convinc'd am I of the propriety of my conduct, I will not sleep, till they are married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding his undoubted merit, I cannot yet be reconcil'd to that unreasonable cus∣tom of contracting persons, who never saw each other; compelling them to be of the same opinion, in the most important concern of life, before you know whether they cou'd agree about the most insignificant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd only compel her to her good, and think I am the best judge what measures to pursue.—Opinions indeed!—If you, Don <HI>Juan,</HI> delay the disposal of your sister in marriage, till she is able to determine what her opinion is, or (to express myself conformably to your easy tem∣per) till she has fix'd her affections, she may give you a brother-in-law very ill suited to your choice, and judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange! that your understanding, edu∣cation, and travels, shou'd not have allay'd that severe opinion of women; by strangers imputed to us as a national fault, and indeed with too much justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Persons, who cannot comprehend the mo∣tives, which actuate such as are wiser than them∣selves, ever make strange interpretations of their conduct. I am determin'd no longer to endure the daily, the hourly anxieties, and fears, which a solicitude for <HI>Honoria</HI>'s conduct has given me; this night they end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have had the like charge of a sister, you know, these thirteen years, and cannot recol∣lect a pain mine ever gave to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>The comparison don't hold; their dispo∣sitions are different; yet, I wish, Don <HI>Juan,</HI> you may not suffer for your easiness of temper; you give the reins too much into your sister's hands; the thoughtlessness of youth, and passions un∣controul'd, may lead her far astray; 'tis too much to be fear'd; I have strong reasons, have nicely weigh'd her conduct—you may repent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you allude to; but the transactions of that fatal night are far from alarm∣ing me about <HI>Felicia</HI>'s conduct; 'tis true, Don <HI>Pedro</HI> was kill'd under my balcony; you throw the deed on <HI>Florio,</HI> and his flight seems to justify the ac∣cusation; yet, what reproach does this cast on
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
her? For when I offer'd, in consequence of your assertion, that he had dishonourable designs on her, to interfere with you in his behalf, to stop the prosecution, and give her hand to him, if her happiness consisted therein, she utterly declin'd it; assuring me she had no one motive to wish for such an event, but many to avoid it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too blind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you too suspicious; why shou'd she deceive me? Have I not ever assur'd her I wou'd consult her inclination?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there's the curse, that ties my tongue.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I therefore cannot, will not doubt her. Her heart is generous and honest; on such dispo∣sitions, indulgence weighs more than severity; and cou'd you be induc'd to alter your conduct towards <HI>Honoria—</HI>but I ask pardon; your own judgment must be your director; short as my ab∣sence has been, events may have occur'd, which may render me now an incompetent adviser.—Your sister is mistress of many virtues; and fame speaks loudly of <HI>Antonio,</HI> as a man, a scholar, and a soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>On those considerations, let our argument die. I am determin'd. Will you accompany me to our friend and kinsman the corregidor? I wou'd require him to be a witness, and partaker of our ceremonies to-night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will but conduct my sister to her cousin <HI>Honoria,</HI> to whom she has devoted this evening, and attend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I expect you in the Piazza?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man, with a heart at ease like his, may well preach such doctrine; but I carry a load of inquietude in mine.—My sister married, one
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
weighty care is remov'd, but a far heavier re∣mains.—Ungrateful, blind <HI>Felicia!—</HI>what suffer∣ings am I doom'd to undergo, yet know not how to utter or relieve them! to love, adore, doubt, fear, suspect, despair, yet still persist to love! I blush at my own weakness—to apply, and be re∣fus'd, were a perpetual thorn to me! and that, from her blind prepossession to another, and <HI>Juan</HI>'s passive acquiescence to her choice, is almost cer∣tain! rivall'd too in her affections by a man, who, but a short time before, had ask'd my sister of me; my pride, my honour is insulted; revenge is my only remedy; in that I will persist, and experience its utmost efficacy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd <HI>Felicia</HI> were come! her kind and chearful temper might give me some relief—Yet how can I expect it? This tyrant brother! can I call him less! to compel me to marry a man I never saw, while the chosen of my heart is forc'd to avoid me—is rejected. My brother's hatred cou'd scarce entail on me a greater misery than his care—Yet what can I do? His power over me is unlimited—no alternative left, but what is de∣sperate; yet something must be done; I cannot thus tamely subscribe to my own unhappiness.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JUAN <HI>introducing</HI> FELICIA.</STAGE>

<P>With pleasure I escort my sister to so dear and amiable a friend—methinks 'tis pity even a wall shou'd make the houses two, of neigh∣bours so entirely one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the houses are more entirely one, than you imagine, my dear brother; thanks to our private door.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have ever thought the slightest separa∣tion, inconsistent with our friendship—You oblige me with a most welcome favour in uniting us now; 'tis a degree of charity, and I thank you. Am I to be honour'd with your company too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd with great pleasure stay, but an en∣gagement with your brother calls me; and the least trespass on his punctilious temper, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I call my cousin mine for the night?</P>

<P>Her own inclination is her ruler. Your most obedient.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a brother for you—upon my word if he were not so related, I shou'd be apt to mis∣take him for a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>And give him encouragement perhaps?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, if my heart were free, and I cou'd be convinc'd that same politeness would not abate on marriage; a little of that, you know, goes a great way in a husband—But am I never to see my sweet friend smile again?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd willingly put off my grief, to avoid disturbing your gaiety, but am not able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me put off my gaiety, that I may not interrupt your grief; there is often ease in the indulgence of it, and I am too giddy for you. Tell me, my dear <HI>Honoria,</HI> how can I metamor∣phose myself so as to suit your feelings? I wou'd be, or do, any thing that might give you pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>You never fail to do that.—Your every look, and word, has affection in it; and that agreeable manner of setting them off, makes what wou'd be stil'd levity in others, a virtue in you, as it's only spring is from a desire to entertain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel</SPEAKER>
<P>Deliver'd with singular judgment, and po∣literess: your's to the very ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Engaging playfulness! how can so tender, so susceptible a heart as yours be so much at ease, in it's present doubtful, and anxious situation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true—and it is sometimes other∣wise; but as I have not to charge fortune, or friends, with any actual affliction, I bear accidental ills as well as I am able, and endeavour to keep sorrow at arm's length. My hopes, I think, grow faster than my fears, and I trust to the great mid∣wife, Time, to bring forth the fruits of 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>And may they answer your deserts! I have almost lost a part of my grief, in my amazement at the adventures you were relating to me last night, when my lordly brother interrupted us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, absence is a pretty whet to affection, now and then; he is ten times worse than ever; there's no getting a moment now; his love, and jealousy, together keep him in a perpetual fidget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd not sleep, for thinking of your story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, is it not a fine one? since the days of don <HI>Quixotte,</HI> to this present seven o'clock in the evening, sure never was a better subject for ro∣mance—Let me see, I'll enumerate the particulars: Travels—Surprizes—Wars—Drums—Trumpets,—taken prisoner—attack'd by a ruffian—sav'd by a heroic self-defence!—Swooning!—Recovery!—and such a recovery! in the arms of a hand∣some young fellow! O lud! cousin!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who had kill'd the attempter of your honour too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no—you forget—I had the credit of the victory over him—As soon as he began to use violence, I seiz'd his dagger, and menac'd his destruction, (ay and meant it too) when a sudden alarm, and fear for his own safety, reliev'd me from the monster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came you depriv'd of your bro∣ther's assistance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was coming to that, when Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> interrupted us—in defending himself, and me, (which he did, a long time, with great galantry, ere we were taken prisoners) he receiv'd some slight wounds, and was lodg'd in an upper apartment of the house.—I was taken to a pavilion in the garden, which, I presume, the wretch, who assaulted me, thought most fit for his wicked purposes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your attachments to your relation, the Count <HI>D'Oniate,</HI> and the concern your brother had in his embassy to the emperor, threaten'd surely a longer absence. What occasion'd your return?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother was suddenly recall'd to his regiment, by royal command; and the necessity for using dispatch in our return to <HI>Sevil,</HI> induc'd him to take the nearest road—too near the enemies quarters—and thence we were made prisoners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, I have sensibly partaken every fear, and distress, during your relation, and la∣ment the necessity, that involv'd you in such per∣plexities, tho' it restor'd so much of my happiness to me—And you dearly love the noble soldier, who offered to revenge your injuries, or die beside you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most entirely.—I always speak truth, you know: if a sudden passion, a first-sight love, is justifiable in any one, it is surely so in me; I sup∣pose gratitude may have some share; but then such a person, such looks, such words—however, I am mistaken, if I did not leave him as much cause to remember the adventure, as he did me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then did he leave you so abruptly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What cou'd the poor soul do? the trumpets summon'd him, his men call'd loudly for their commander; there was, to be sure, a notable
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
combat between love and honour, but honour got the better, and I honour him for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what was this gallant hero's name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not; I had neither means, nor time, to enquire: the moment my brother had recover'd some few hours strength, we were oblig'd to set off—But enough of my affairs; how stand my sweet friend's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worse, and worse, <HI>Felicia,—</HI>so near a crisis, that my brother is determin'd on my mar∣rying this night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother hinted as much, as we came here; but I cou'd scarce believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis too true<HI>—Henriquez</HI> has just receiv'd advice, that the person, to whom I am contracted, will arrive this evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How absurd, and cruel! and poor <HI>Florio—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now doubly banish'd; first from my bro∣ther's positive forbiddance of his addresses, and visits, on account of this unhappy contract; and then, from the ill-fated death of Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> whom, in self-defence, you know, he kill'd: if he is found, my brother's evidence must condemn him to the law, and his resentment seeks all occasions to compass the most severe gratifications.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rash, inconsiderate, unfeeling man! Was not his savage love of me the cause, which drives him hourly to some mad extreme? Then that un∣lucky similitude of dress, which led him to believe <HI>Florio</HI> was entertaining me, that fatal evening, in our balcony! nay, allowing his suspicions had been grounded in truth, cou'd nothing appease him, but assassinating <HI>Florio,</HI> and hazarding his friend Don <HI>Pedro</HI> in so bafe a cause? Can he suppose such desperate, such terrifying proofs of passion, (which while his pride will not suffer him to own, he weakly fancies is unseen) wou'd not disgust my heart?</P>

<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>However he has disdain'd to trust a wo∣man, I wonder his friendship with your brother has not induc'd him to ask your hand of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh my dear! two most weighty reasons are against it; first his pride, lest he shou'd be refus'd; secondly, my brother's strong dislike of forc'd marriages, to which he is no stranger; tho', between you and me, my dear, my brother is as well convinc'd of his passion, as we are; and proceed∣ed so far, as to apply to me thereon; but finding my aversion, my horror at the very mention of it, according to his accustom'd tenderness, he has never since re-assum'd the topic; but has <HI>Henriquez</HI> at last graciously been pleas'd to tell you your in∣tended husband's name?</P>

<P>If my brother is set down to write, I think I may say an hour is securely mine; for his ex∣travagant suspicion makes him distrust the sense of his own words, and he'll weigh a subscription to a scruple, lest he shou'd degrade his dignity by his style; therefore I'll to <HI>Florio,</HI> let him know the straits to which I am driven, and that all hopes are over, unless he can devise some prompt ex∣pedient to relieve us.</P>

<P>There's no saying what may be the conse∣quence of the mistake, but it was a lucky thing for me, I'm sure; for I shou'd not have known how to speak for myself.</P>

<P>Madam, do we go? What do you re∣solve?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well; but where do you design your interview?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the remotest part of the garden, which fronts my apartment, you know; where I have often met him, since your absence depriv'd us of the

advantages of your friendly assistance, and the pri∣vate door to your portion of Don <HI>Juan</HI>'s house; <HI>Rosa</HI> has a key to the back-door of our garden.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how cou'd she get that? Not by fair means, I'm sure.<HI>—Henriquez</HI> us'd to be as tenaci∣ous of his keys, as of his long-spun pedigree; and even open'd a door himself with as much cau∣tious fear, as if he apprehended a piece of his ancestry shou'd make it's escape at it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>He justly wou'd deserve it, tho' nothing but the last distress, I think, shou'd urge me to such measures, as the world might censure: yet, were not my affections so strongly pre-engag'd, to a delicate feeling, surely it is no trifling wound, to be oblig'd to give a worthy man a hand, without a heart.</P>

<P>Come, come, hope well—and do not tor∣ment your mind any further;—let us retire to your chamber, and, while we wait <HI>Rosa</HI>'s return, I'll try to raise your spirits, with your favourite song.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SANCHO.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT a confounded pace we have come! but you are always the same, sir. You proceed in the attack of a mistress, with as much vigour, and activity, as you storm a garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dispatch is the soul of every undertaking: I hate all that savours of coldness, and delay. In a pursuit, so insipidly carried on, the spirits relax, and, tho' you gain your ends, you scarce relish the success.—What do you smile at, <HI>Sancho?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>You expect the truth, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I do. I cannot brook falshood, even in the veriest trifles; lest the mind be insen∣sibly led on to practise it in material affairs, and thereby entail on itself such a reproach, as most disgraces manhood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, sir, I smiled at the oddity of your amours. First, to fall in love with one you hardly ever saw; and then, make such haste to marry one, you never saw. We poor mortals have another method.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reflections, like those of the world in general, are too hasty and superficial; not know∣ing my motives, you wonder at my conduct. How many faultless characters, thro' too severe, and premature conclusions, have had a shade drawn over them, which time, and reason, have, at last, wholly removed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I ask pardon, if I have offended,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot easily offend. You have gain'd on my temper, and won an indulgence, which your courage and fidelity well deserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, sir, you are earlier, than you ex∣pected, by an hour almost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then suppose, sir, you return to the post∣house, and lay aside these unnecessary implements for walking; then, if you please, you may relieve your legs a little more; I can stay in the house, to be ready, when <HI>Ernesto</HI> comes, according to your orders.</P>

<P>Come, <HI>Guzman,</HI> now we may venture to quit our dens, take a little fresh air, and begin chace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chace! now the sun is set. Of what, sir? Owls, or bats? Call you this making love?—'Tis much more like making war—marching all night in arms, as if we were going to beat up the enemies quarters, on a forlorn hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would not you venture as much for <HI>Rosa?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, in good faith, sir, I shall venture enough, if I marry her; I'll run no hazards be∣fore hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's from your fear, not your prudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you may call it what you please, but I dare boldly say, there lives not a more valiant man in the world, than myself, while danger keeps at distance; but when faucily it presses on me,
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
then, I confess, I have a certain tenderness for life, which checks my ardour, and inclines my prudence to make a timely retreat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>How civil your stile is to yourself!—and how prettily you soften that harsh word, cowar∣dice!—but, I think, I have seen your valour pleas'd to run away, when danger has not been so very pressing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may not have appear'd so, sir, to com∣mon eyes; but I have such a piercing sight, that I can discover perils at a greater distance than any man in <HI>Spain.—</HI>Other people (poor souls!) not be∣ing blessed with such perspicuity, do not descry dangers, time enough to shun 'em, and then their struggling is by the injudicious world called cou∣rage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man truly valiant will always remain so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man wisely valiant will avoid all the danger he can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have more light, than heat, I'll allow, <HI>Guzman.</HI> But your humour, and honesty, make amends for your want of courage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have courage enough for the profession my parents design'd me for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was: that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lawyer. I could have put on rare an∣ger in my client's sight, and, when he was gone, have hugged the advocate of the opposite party; and, if I don't mistake, sir, those gentry sell their breath, much dearer than you gentlemen soldiers sell your blood; 'tis true, you get honour—a fine light food, for delicate appetites!—yet I have known some captains of plain stomachs fast upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The knave's right—but how I trifle time! What's this to my embarrassments in love?—How shall I contrive to hear from my <HI>Honoria?—</HI>Shall I venture to my old haunts?—I dare not—To what purpose should I, unless she were pre-advised of
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
it? This last unhappy accident! left to solitude, and thought—and that loaded with the disagree∣able reflection of having shed another's blood!—which (tho' it chanced in self-defence) my reason, and education, will not let me easily digest.—Yet, <HI>Honoria!</HI> she must be mine; and I will leave no peril unencounter'd, to obtain her.—If, after all, I fail—if I must lose her, at least, I will deserve her.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ANTONIO, <HI>and</HI> SANCHO.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am tired with waiting.</P>

<P>He cannot be long now, sir, surely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll take another minute's turn—go you back to the inn, and wait me there— <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> San.]</STAGE> I scarce can tell the name of any place, I see. 'Tis so long, since I was in this city, I have lost all my measures of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do my eyes cheat me, or is that my com∣rade, when I first bore arms? My friend <HI>Antonio?</HI> If it be he, as sure it must, I cannot dread to know him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Florio!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>My honour'd friend!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were too long in recollecting me—Your friendship cannot cool?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never—but your presence here, so unex∣pected, made me disbelieve my sight.—When came you to town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I just now arrived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice to see you; but should have thought it more likely to hear of you at court, pursuing the recompence due to your deserts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>An employment I am neither fond, nor capable of. I cannot sue, even for my right. 'Tis my-ambition to merit, but not solicit reward. The dignity of honour suffers in it. If praise, and advancement, do not follow our services, we
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
must learn to pay ourselves, by a noble contempt of worldly favours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>A severe rule indeed, which virtue pre∣scribes to herself!—to be so backward in claiming a reward, she is so eager to deserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. She is more hurt in being reduced to beg reward, than she can be in the want of it—Besides, a true subject hazards his life in the service of his king and country, for the advancement of their honour and interest solely; he, who does it with a view to his own, deserves neither praise, nor reward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same great, and generous spirit, as ever. I honour the day, which introduced me to the knowledge of so much worth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What merit I have, I can but faintly call my own—I inherit it from a father, whose example of courage, and integrity, it had been scandalous in a son not to have imitated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is my house, at present, <HI>Antonio—</HI>Will you honour it, by calling it your's? Tho' you must excuse many deficiencies in your enter∣tainment. I am but in an ill condition, at pre∣sent, to receive the honour of such a guest; hav∣ing, by an unhappy accident, been obliged, lately, to change my usual place of residence, and keep myself concealed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Concealed!—but that is for a future hour, and more suitable place.—I must however decline your kind offer a while, being forced to remain hereabouts, lest I should miss the return of one, whom I sent to my brother-in-law's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me—Have you a brother-in-law in <HI>Seville?</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me—I cannot—if there be any merit in my behaviour, my own breath would fully it—if not, the report is not fit for a friend's ear.—But if you chuse to fill up the time, I'll give you an adventure of mine, which, I fancy, will repay your attention.</P>

<P>You will oblige me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your preface awakes my curiosity—to the story, I beseech you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the evening, following that glorious day, whereon the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> gain'd such dis∣tinguish'd reputation, I was dispatch'd with some horse, to cover the <HI>Limbourg</HI> frontiers, which were too much exposed to the enemy's inroads.—We were scarce arrived, when I receiv'd intelligence, that a party of them (about 200 cavalry) were newly lodged in a village, three leagues off. We instantly sounded to horse, and, not to trouble you with particulars, so great was our expedition, that, by day-break, their quarters were on fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>You experienced the utility of your own maxim, that diligence in execution is the mistress of success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our foes made but faint resistance—some were slain,—some fled to give alarm to their re∣serves in quarters remote.—The tumult nigh over. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a lofty structure, supposing it

was their leader's quarter—with intention to pre∣serve him from the soldier's rage, and his build∣ing from the fire—but what was my surprize, when, entering a pavilion in the garden, I beheld a woman of a matchless form stretched on the marble floor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your heart suffered then, I am sure—Pity and bravery always dwell together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I felt, what I cannot describe—tho', at first, I believ'd her dead, yet her appearance inspir'd me with such awe, and reverence, that I could not, without trembling, venture to approach her.—I knelt, and raised her in my arms, when strait a sigh stole from her. I knew it not for a sound of grief, while it was a sign of life. At last, she open'd her lovely eyes, and beam'd such looks (spite of her sad situation) as I had ne'er expe∣rienced. Awhile I was held mute with wonder, and delight, when a poniard fell from her fair hand—as if she only wanted arms asleep, and waking trusted to her eyes.—My sensations en∣creased each moment;—when I recover'd power to speak, I said—I know not what—It was all extasy, yet it had its rise in sincerity.—She endea∣vour'd to reply, but could not—yet she looked such sweet surprize—such gratitude—tho' mixed with fear—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am all impatience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I renewed my ardent professions—offer'd my life for the recovery of her's—I labour'd to know her story—The crimson in her cheeks seemed reviving, and her speech returning, when a sud∣den loud blast of trumpets, and outcry of my men, alarmed me. They were charged with squadrons of fresh horse, whom the fugitives had called from neigbouring villages. I longed to stay with her—I panted to be with them—my powers, for a time, were suspended—but awaking
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
to that sense of honour, from which no claim should alienate a soldier, I tore myself away. The situation of my mind added to my usual heat—I was desperate in fight, and sustained so many wounds, that I swooned with loss of blood, while my soldiers compleated the victory, and brought me off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel for you in all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>My outward wounds were slight, and quickly healed; but those within, deep, and still so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly bleeding. My heart, and happiness seem'd utterly to have forsaken me. My enquiries after her were vain, and I returned to my post in the army, loaded with the despair of ever seeing her again, from whom my aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions can never stray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, indeed, given me cause for concern, as well as wonder.—So engaged, how comes this strange marriage? From what induce∣ments? Your mind is above the general tempta∣tions of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>From duty, gratitude, and justice—Long before this event, I was contracted to the lady, whom I now come to marry, by the Marquis <HI>D'Oliverc,</HI> whose patronage and friendship, from my infancy, would render my disobedience to a re∣commendation of his highly improper.—Besides, when he first proposed this match, my heart was wholly disengaged—now there is no retracting.</P>

<P>Ay, then my disgrace is certain, 'tis pub∣lick, and perpetual infamy is my portion.—This the reward for all my cares!—my incessant tor∣ments!—daily cautions!—hourly admonitions! A man had better have to rule beasts of prey, than women—they have not half their designs—their cruelty—ingratitude! She hath buried my heart in sorrow, and engraven dishonour on the tomb of her ancestors.—She stole away!—her accomplices escaped!—and no means of revenge to be found!

<P>I soon discover'd some, whom I suspected to be the villains; but unable singly to attack 'em, I kept a little distance, to observe which way they took, when one of their party, who was be∣hind the rest, confirm'd me in my suspicions; mistaking me for one of his own crew, he bade me come on, saying his master was but just before—</P>

<P>You have given me new life; let me but enjoy my revenge, and, tho' the next moment were my last, I cou'd die contented. Call all my servants—I will besiege that impious dwelling; I'll reduce that theatre of my disgrace to ashes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again in these mad fits! for shame, con∣sult your reason; how wild and impracticable were the attempt, to assail a house at this time of night in a well govern'd city! it would only expose your person and fortune to the rigour of the law, pub∣lish your dishonour, and frustrate your revenge for ever.</P>

<P>Be but rul'd by me, I'll shew you the surest and nearest way to gain it; I'll instantly to the corregidor's, for the aid of his authority, to secure them for the present, and to-morrow give 'em up to the law.</P>

<P>Away—away—Conceive you I will wait such slow decisions? Submit a personal injury to the tame formal law? Oh! no; my honour chal∣lenges redress from my own arm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour consists in reason, and in justice, not in frantick violence—that only is your idol. I pray be calm—reflect—all my design is but to conceal the shame, till we have the villains in our power; which cannot be brought about, by any means, so sure, as by demanding justice against the assaulters of your house and person; trust to my conduct; I'll be speedier than you can think, and bring you satisfaction instantly.</P>

<P>The danger in that is not half so terrify∣ing, as being found here;—admit there were no cause to fear the sad effects of cruelty, and re∣venge, yet being seen in your house would be in∣terpreted into all that calumny could invent.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! my <HI>Florio,</HI> the unhappy are always in the wrong, and slander, once propagated, never dies. Why did I leave my brother's house? Why engage your love and tenderness in an adventure, that may prove your ruin?</P>

<P>As much aversion as I have, madam, to throwing myself in harm's way, yet I am really so concern'd at the mistake I have made, that I almost wish I had endur'd a few blows, rather than have brought such a distress upon you—</P>

<P>But what disaster brings you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>A terrible one, madam,—you're found out, and pursued—Don <HI>Juan,</HI> by the help of the moon, and a mistake of some of your party, trac'd you to this house, and, in my hearing, informed your

<P>I am the obliged, madam. <HI>Guzman,</HI> go seek your master, and tell him the danger not al∣lowing us to wait, I will convey his mistress to a nunnery. <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Guz.]</STAGE> Within religious walls she must be secure.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! On recollection, they will not open the monastery gates, at this hour, without a strict enquiry, and that would equally betray us.—I have it—the happiest thought! I will convey you, madam, to my brother-in-law's. His quality and honour will be a sanction to you, and my wife will with pleasure pay the offices due to your vir∣tue, and distress. The liberty, I take herein, I am confident they will approve and thank me for. <HI>Sancho,</HI> stay here, represent all this to <HI>Florio,</HI> and

conduct him with the utmost caution and secresy to my apartment; happily I have the key<HI>—Ernesto</HI> sits up for me, so I shan't want it; and, for <HI>Florio</HI>'s better security, tell him, 'tis my counsel that he comes in a chair.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>His behaviour, and motives, then are well explain'd—The man, to whom I was engag'd, has been a witness to my concealment, my shame—my passion for another—and he has used this means

<P>How could I in such darkness, such fear, such confusion? beside, he brought me in the back way, thro' his own quarter, and had the lights put out, before he introduc'd me—Well, I am pre∣par'd to suffer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in such haste, my dear girl—while there is life there is hope—I'll struggle to the last moment—Don't you remember the mistake <HI>Anto∣nio</HI>'s servant made this afternoon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Antonio'</HI> has done the same, in your absence; and, on your account, I did not disabuse him. He has renew'd his vows of love with equal ardour, as when he first saw me, and seem'd transported to discover his destin'd wife in the woman whom he rescued. There hangs your hope, and mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vain suggestion! What hope can we have, while this cruel contract remains such a bar to our general happiness?—Besides, he has seen my bro∣ther by this time—the whole is out—and ruin cer∣tain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so very certain, as you apprehend. <HI>Antonio</HI>'s friendship to <HI>Florio,</HI> which induc'd him to-protect you, may yet—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friendship! dear <HI>Felicia,</HI> will that remain unshaken?—will that stand up against these strange

events?—against the affront done to his honour? Oh! no—He is not what he was,—his mind, his principles are changed, and I am made the victim to his wrath—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lovely girl!—excuse my warmth—but I must repeat my assertions—If we have yet a chance for happiness, 'tis founded in his steadiness and truth—The more I contemplate it, the more do my spirits and hopes revive.

<P>Your sister, and this lady, Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> both can witness I never had a thought to injure your happiness, or honour.

<P>My shame! my eternal shame! what shall I say? you see me overwhelm'd with confusion; if I have acted in a manner unbecoming my name, and honour, attribute it to love—(I seek not longer to conceal it,) a hurt, a desperate, jealous love for that ungrateful creature.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cousin, I will now own, I have perceiv'd it long; and in justice to our friendship, and alli∣ance, have even address'd my sister on the subject; but found such insurmountable objections to your but
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
violence of temper, that, in consideration of what your pride might suffer, I conceal'd my knowledge of your passion, even from yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cou'd a man of Don <HI>Henriquez'</HI> sense, and penetration, suppose his tyrannic treatment of so amiable a sister, such everlasting doubts, suspici∣ons, jealousies, restrictions, and severities, must not disgust rather than win a woman's heart? Cou'd you but have subdued those passions, perhaps, ere I had seen that gentleman, I might have been in∣duc'd to think of you in such a light, as your per∣son, and natural endowments deserv'd; if a dis∣appointment herein be painful, to your self alone you are indebted for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forbear, I pray you; shew not the happi∣ness I might have reached, nor add the weight of your reproaches, to my self-condemnation; my punishment is sufficient without it;—I have justly railed; when such a heart as mine concedes, the pangs it suffers are not trivial.</P>

<P>Yet to convince you that my sorrow is not selfish; as I have been the source of general uneasiness, I will endeavour to make a general amends, let my own heart suffer what it may: first madam, may you enjoy more happiness, if possible, than I have wish'd to partake with you; and, sir, to you, unask'd I thus resign this contract, which love and justice both forbid me now to claim,</P>

<L>Where e'er we go, what e'er we do, or say,</L>
<L>Make it your rule—to give us our own way;</L>
<L>Neither attempt to lead us, nor restrain,</L>
<L>But let us have the length of all the rein;</L>
<L>In shoppings, auctions, jauntings, or Quadrille,</L>
<L>Leave us to spend, and lose what e'er we will;</L>
<L>Let all our fav'rite foibles take their course,</L>
<L>(For every breather has some hobby-horse)</L>
<L><PB REF="86"/>
With whatsoever whims or freaks you meet,</L>
<L>Still let your words and looks alike be sweet—</L>
<L>Lord! when thus left to our own tempers free,</L>
<L>The sweetest creatures in the world are we!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence this important Maxim is defin'd,</L>
<L>Ye <HI>wise ones,</HI> keep it ever in your mind—</L>
<L>We women never frown, if never teaz'd,</L>
<L>And, always humour'd,—we are always pleas'd.</L>
