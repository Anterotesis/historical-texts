<L N="70">Two female forms, of more than mortal mien:</L>

<L>Such the chaste image of the martial maid,</L>
<L N="80">In artless folds of virgin white array'd.</L>

<L>She prov'd th' engaging chastity of dress;</L>
<L>And while she chose in native charms to shine,</L>

The gaudy topaz lent its gay supplies,</L>
