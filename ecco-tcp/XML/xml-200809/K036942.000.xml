<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. SPARKS.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>IN antient times, when <HI>Britain</HI>'s trade was arms,</L>
<L>And the lov'd musick of her youth, alarms.</L>
<L>A god-like race sustain'd fair <HI>England</HI>'s fame:</L>
<L>Who has not heard of gallant <HI>PIERCY</HI>'s name?</L>
<L>Ay, and of <HI>DOUGLAS?</HI> Such illustrious foes</L>
<L>In rival <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> never rose!</L>
<L>From age to age bright shone the <HI>British</HI> fire,</L>
<L>And every hero was a hero's sire.</L>
<L>When powerful fate decreed one warrior's doom,</L>
<L>Up sprung the Phoenix from his parent's tomb.</L>
<L>But whilst these generous rivals fought and fell,</L>
<L>These generous rivals lov'd each other well:</L>
<L>Tho' many a bloody field was lost and won,</L>
<L>Nothing in hate, in honour all was done.</L>
<L>When <HI>PIERCY</HI> wrong'd defy'd his prince or peers,</L>
<L>Fast came the <HI>DOUGLAS,</HI> with his <HI>Scottish</HI> spears;</L>
<L>And, when proud <HI>DOUGLAS</HI> made his King his foe,</L>
<L>For <HI>DOUGLAS, PIERCY</HI> bent his <HI>English</HI> bow.</L>
<L>Expell'd their native homes by adverse fate,</L>
<L>They knock'd alternate at each other's gate:</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>Then blaz'd the castle, at the midnight hour,</L>
<L>For him whose arms had shook its firmest tower.</L>
<L>This night a <HI>DOUGLAS</HI> your protection claims;</L>
<L>A wife! a mother! pity's softest names:</L>
<L>The story of her woes indulgent hear,</L>
<L>And grant your suppliant all she begs, a tear.</L>
<L>In confidence she begs; and hopes to find</L>
<L>Each <HI>English</HI> breast, like noble <HI>PIERCY</HI>'s kind.</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>The court of a castle, surrounded with woods.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lady RANDOLPH.</STAGE>
<L>YE woods and wilds, whose melancholy gloom</L>
<L>Accords with my soul's sadness, and draws forth</L>
<L>The voice of sorrow from my bursting heart,</L>
<L>Farewel a while: I will not leave you long;</L>
<L>For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells,</L>
<L>Who from the chiding stream, or groaning oak,</L>
<L>Still hears, and answers to MATILDA's moan.</L>
<L>O DOUGLAS! DOUGLAS! If departed ghosts</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>Are e'er permitted to review this world,</L>
<L>Within the circle of that wood thou art,</L>
<L>And with the passion of immortals hear'st</L>
<L>My lamentation: hear'st thy wretched wife</L>
<L>Weep for her husband slain, her infant lost.</L>
<L>My brother's timeless death I seem to mourn;</L>
<L>Who perish'd with thee on this fatal day.</L>
<L>To thee I lift my voice; to thee address</L>
<L>The plaint which mortal ear has never heard.</L>
<L>O disregard me not; though I am call'd</L>
<L>Another's now, my heart is wholly thine.</L>
<L>Incapable of change, affection lies</L>
<L>Buried, my DOUGLAS, in thy bloody grave.</L>
<L>But RANDOLPH comes, whom fate has made my Lord,</L>
<L>To chide my anguish, and defraud the dead.</L>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lord RANDOLPH.</STAGE>
<L>Again these weeds of woe! say, do'st thou well</L>
<L>To feed a passion which consumes thy life?</L>
<L>The living claim some duty; vainly thou</L>
<L>Bestow'st thy cares upon the silent dead.</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Silent, alas! is he for whom I mourn:</L>
<L>Childless, without memorial of his name,</L>
<L>He only now in my remembrance lives.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Time, that wears out the trace of deepest anguish,</L>
<L>Has past o'er thee in vain. Wou'd thou wer't not</L>
<L>Compos'd of grief and tenderness alone!</L>
<L>Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir MALCOLM:</L>
<L>Strong was his rage, eternal his resentment:</L>
<L>For when thy brother fell, he smil'd to hear</L>
<L>That DOUGLAS' son in the same field was slain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! rake not up the ashes of my fathers:</L>
<L>Implacable resentment was their crime,</L>
<L>And grievous has the expiation been.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="8"/>Contending with the DOUGLAS, gallant lives</L>
<L>Of either house were lost; my ancestors</L>
<L>Compell'd, at last, to leave their ancient seat</L>
<L>On Tiviot's pleasant banks; and now, of them</L>
<L>No heir is left. Had they not been so stern,</L>
<L>I had not been the last of all my race.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy grief wrests to its purposes my words.</L>
<L>I never ask'd of thee that ardent love,</L>
<L>Which in the breasts of fancy's children burns.</L>
<L>Decent affection, and complacent kindness</L>
<L>Were all I wish'd for; but I wish'd in vain.</L>
<L>Hence with the less regret my eyes behold</L>
<L>The storm of war that gathers o'er this land:</L>
<L>If I should perish by the Danish sword,</L>
<L>MATILDA would not shed one tear the more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou do'st not think so: woeful as I am</L>
<L>I love thy merit, and esteem thy virtues.</L>
<L>But whither goest thou now?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Straight to the camp,</L>
<L>Where every warrior on the tip-toe stands</L>
<L>Of expectation, and impatient asks</L>
<L>Each who arrives, if he is come to tell</L>
<L>The Danes are landed.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, may adverse winds,</L>
<L>Far from the coast of Scotland, drive their fleet!</L>
<L>And every soldier of both hosts return</L>
<L>In peace and safety to his pleasant home!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou speak'st a woman's, hear a warrior's wish:</L>
<L>Right from their native land, the stormy north,</L>
<L>May the wind blow, till every keel is fix'd</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="9"/>Immoveable in Caledonia's strand!</L>
<L>Then shall our foes repent their bold invasion,</L>
<L>And roving armies shun the fatal shore.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>War I detest: but war with foreign foes,</L>
<L>Whose manners, language, and whose looks are strange,</L>
<L>Is not so horrid, nor to me so hateful,</L>
<L>As that which with our neighbours oft we wage.</L>
<L>A river here, there an ideal line</L>
<L>By fancy drawn, divides the sister kingdoms.</L>
<L>On each side dwells a people similar,</L>
<L>As twins are to each other, valiant both,</L>
<L>Both for their valour famous thro' the world.</L>
<L>Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,</L>
<L>And, if they must have war, wage distant war,</L>
<L>But with each other fight in cruel conflict.</L>
<L>Gallant in strife, and noble in their ire,</L>
<L>The battle is their pastime. They go forth</L>
<L>Gay in the morning, as to summer sport:</L>
<L>When ev'ning comes, the glory of the morn,</L>
<L>The youthful warrior, is a clod of clay.</L>
<L>Thus fall the prime of either hapless land;</L>
<L>And such the fruit of Scotch and English wars.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll hear no more: this melody would make</L>
<L>A soldier drop his sword, and doff his arms,</L>
<L>Sit down and weep the conquests he has made;</L>
<L>Yea, (like a monk), sing rest and peace in heav'n</L>
<L>To souls of warriours in his battles slain.</L>
<L>Lady, farewel: I leave thee not alone;</L>
<L>Yonder comes one whose love makes duty light.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ANNA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forgive the rashness of your ANNA's love:</L>
<L>Urg'd by affection, I have thus presum'd</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="10"/>To interrupt your solitary thoughts;</L>
<L>And warn you of the hours that you neglect,</L>
<L>And lose in sadness.</L>

<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>So to lose my hours</L>
<L>Is all the use I wish to make of time.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>To blame thee, lady, suits not with my state:</L>
<L>But sure I am, since death first prey'd on man,</L>

<L>What had your sorrows been if you had lost,</L>

<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh!</L>

<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Have I distrest you with officious love,</L>
<L>And ill-tim'd mention of your brother's fate?</L>
<L>Forgive me, lady: humble tho' I am,</L>
<L>The mind I bear partakes not of my fortune:</L>
<L>So fervently I love you, that to dry</L>
<L>These piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.</L>

<L>No, thou shalt not be silent.</L>
<L>I'll trust thy faithful love, and thou shalt be</L>

<L>And in some cavern of the ocean lyes</L>
<L>My child and his.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! lady, most rever'd!</L>
<L>The tale wrapt up in your amazing words</L>
<L>Deign to unfold.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! an ancient feud,</L>
<L>Hereditary evil, was the source</L>
<L>Of my misfortunes. Ruling fate decreed,</L>
<L>That my brave brother should in battle save</L>
<L>The life of DOUGLAS' son, our house's foe:</L>
<L>The youthful warriours vow'd eternal friendship.</L>
<L>To see the vaunted sister of his friend</L>
<L>Impatient, DOUGLAS to Balarmo came,</L>
<L>Under a borrow'd name.—My heart he gain'd;</L>
<L>Nor did I long refuse the hand he begg'd:</L>
<L>My brother's presence authoriz'd our marriage.</L>
<L>Three weeks, three little weeks, with wings of down,</L>
<L>Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd lord was call'd</L>
<L>To fight his father's battles; and with him,</L>
<L>In spite of all my tears, did MALCOLM go.</L>
<L>Scarce were they gone, when my stern sire was told</L>
<L>That the false stranger was lord DOUGLAS' son.</L>
<L>Frantic with rage, the baron drew his sword</L>
<L>And question'd me. Alone, forsaken, faint,</L>
<L>Kneeling beneath his sword, fault'ring I took</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="12"/>An oath equivocal, that I ne'er would</L>
<L>Wed one of DOUGLAS name. Sincerity</L>
<L>Thou first of virtues, let no mortal leave</L>
<L>Thy onward path! altho' the earth should gape,</L>
<L>And from the gulf of hell destruction cry</L>
<L>To take dissimulation's winding way.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! how few of woman's fearful kind</L>
<L>Durst own a truth so hardy!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>The first truth</L>
<L>Is easiest to avow. This moral learn,</L>
<L>This precious moral, from my tragic tale.—</L>
<L>In a few days the dreadful tidings came</L>
<L>That DOUGLAS and my brother both were slain.</L>
<L>My lord! my life! my husband!—mighty God!</L>
<L>What had I done to merit such affliction?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dearest lady! Many a tale of tears</L>
<L>I've listen'd to; but never did I hear</L>
<L>A tale so sad as this.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>In the first days</L>
<L>Of my distracting grief, I found myself—</L>
<L>As women wish to be who love their lords.</L>
<L>But who durst tell my father? The good priest</L>
<L>Who join'd our hands, my brother's antient tutour,</L>
<L>With his lov'd MALCOLM, in the battle fell:</L>
<L>They two alone were privy to the marriage.</L>
<L>On silence and concealment I resolv'd,</L>
<L>Till time should make my father's fortune mine.</L>
<L>That very night on which my son was born,</L>
<L>My nurse, the only confident I had,</L>
<L>Set out with him to reach her sister's house:</L>
<L>But nurse, nor infant, have I ever seen,</L>
<L>Or heard of, ANNA, since that fatal hour.</L>
<L>My murder'd child!—had thy fond mother fear'd</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="13"/>The loss of thee, she had loud fame defy'd,</L>
<L>Despis'd her father's rage, her father's grief,</L>
<L>And wander'd with thee thro' the scorning world.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not seen, nor heard of! then perhaps he lives.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>No. It was dark December: wind and rain</L>
<L>Had beat all night. Across the Carron lay</L>
<L>The destin'd road; and in it's swelling flood</L>
<L>My faithful servant perish'd with my child.</L>
<L>O hapless son! of a most hapless sire!—</L>
<L>But they are both at rest; and I alone</L>
<L>Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,</L>
<L>Like a guilt-troubl'd ghost, my painful rounds:</L>
<L>Nor has despiteful fate permitted me</L>
<L>The comfort of a solitary sorrow.</L>
<L>Tho' dead to love, I was compell'd to wed</L>
<L>RANDOLPH, who snatch'd me from a villain's arms;</L>
<L>And RANDOLPH now possesses the domains,</L>
<L>That by Sir MALCOLM's death on me devolv'd;</L>
<L>Domains, that should to DOUGLAS' son have giv'n</L>
<L>A baron's title, and a baron's power.</L>
<L>Such were my foothing thoughts, while I bewail'd</L>
<L>The slaughter'd father of a son unborn.</L>
<L>And when that son came, like a ray from heav'n,</L>
<L>Which shines and disappears; alas! my child!</L>
<L>How long did thy fond mother grasp the hope</L>
<L>Of having thee, she knew not how, restor'd.</L>
<L>Year after year hath worn her hope away;</L>
<L>But left still undiminish'd her desire.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The hand, that spins th' uneven thread of life,</L>
<L>May smooth the length that's yet to come of your's.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not in this world: I have consider'd well</L>
<L>Its various evils, and on whom they fall.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="14"/>Alas! how oft does goodness wound itself?</L>
<L>And sweet affection prove the spring of woe</L>
<L>O! had I died when my lov'd husband fell!</L>
<L>Had some good angel op'd to me the book</L>
<L>Of providence, and let me read my life,</L>
<L>My heart had broke, when I beheld the sum</L>
<L>Of ills, which one by one I have endur'd.</L>
</SP>

<L>That God, whose ministers good angels are,</L>

<L>I will avoid him. An ungracious person</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why speaks my lady thus of RANDOLPH's heir?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Because he's not the heir of RANDOLPH's virtues.</L>
<L>Subtle and shrewd, he offers to mankind</L>
<L>An artificial image of himself:</L>
<L>And he with ease can vary to the taste</L>
<L>Of different men, it's features. Self-denied,</L>
<L>And master of his appetites he seems:</L>
<L>But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,</L>
<L>Watches to seize unseen the wish'd-for prey.</L>
<L>Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill,</L>
<L>As in GLENALVON's unrelenting mind.</L>
<L>Yet is he brave and politic in war,</L>
<L>And stands aloft in these unruly times.</L>
<L>Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter;</L>
<L>Stay and detain him till I reach the castle.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>That it fares well, thanks to this gallant youth,</L>
<L>Whose valour sav'd me from a wretched death!</L>
<L>As down the winding dale I walk'd alone,</L>
<L>At the cross way four armed men attack'd me:</L>
<L>Rovers, I judge, from the licentious camp,</L>
<L>Who would have quickly laid Lord RANDOLPH low,</L>
<L>Had not this brave and generous stranger come,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>Like my good angel in the hour of fate,</L>
<L>And, mocking danger, made my foes his own.</L>
<L>They turn'd upon him: but his active arm</L>
<L>Struck to the ground, from whence they rose no more,</L>
<L>The fiercest two; the others fled amain,</L>
<L>And left him master of the bloody field.</L>
<L>Speak, Lady RANDOLPH: upon Beauty's tongue</L>
<L>Dwell accents pleasing to the brave and bold.</L>
<L>Speak, noble dame, and thank him for thy lord.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>My lord, I cannot speak what now I feel.</L>
<L>My heart o'erflows with gratitude to heav'n,</L>
<L>And to this noble youth, who all unknown</L>
<L>To you and yours, deliberated not,</L>
<L>Nor paus'd at peril, but humanely brave</L>
<L>Fought on your side, against such fearful odds.</L>
<L>Have you yet learn'd of him whom we should thank?</L>
<L>Whom call the saviour of Lord RANDOLPH's life?</L>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>STRANGER.</SPEAKER>
<L>A low born man, of parentage obscure,</L>
<L>Who nought can boast but his desire to be</L>
<L>A soldier, and to gain a name in arms.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whoe'er thou art, thy spirit is ennobled</L>
<L>By the great King of Kings! thou art ordain'd</L>
<L>And stampt a hero by the sovereign hand</L>
<L>Of nature! blush not, flower of modesty</L>
<L>As well as valour, to declare thy birth.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STRANGER.</SPEAKER>
<L>My name is NORVAL: on the Grampian hills</L>
<L>My father feeds his flocks; a frugal swain,</L>
<L>Whose constant cares were to encrease his store,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="19"/>And keep his only son, myself, at home.</L>
<L>For I had heard of battles, and I long'd</L>
<L>To follow to the field some warlike lord;</L>
<L>And heaven soon granted what my sire denied.</L>
<L>This moon which rose last night, round as my shield,</L>
<L>Had not yet fill'd her horns, when, by her light,</L>
<L>A band of fierce barbarians, from the hills,</L>
<L>Rush'd like a torrent down upon the vale,</L>
<L>Sweeping our flocks and herds. The shepherds fled</L>
<L>For safety, and for succour. I alone,</L>
<L>With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,</L>
<L>Hover'd about the enemy, and mark'd</L>
<L>The road he took, then hasted to my friends;</L>
<L>Whom, with a troop of fifty chosen men,</L>
<L>I met advancing. The pursuit I led,</L>
<L>Till we o'ertook the spoil-encumber'd foe.</L>
<L>We fought and conquer'd. E're a sword was drawn,</L>
<L>An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,</L>
<L>Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.</L>
<L>Returning home in triumph, I disdain'd</L>
<L>The shepherd's slothful life; and having heard</L>
<L>That our good king had summon'd his bold peers</L>
<L>To lead their warriours to the Carron side,</L>
<L>I left my father's house, and took with me</L>
<L>A chosen servant to conduct my steps:—</L>
<L>Yon trembling coward who forsook his master.</L>
<L>Journeying with this intent, I past these towers.</L>
<L>And, heaven-directed, came this day to do</L>
<L>The happy deed that gilds my humble name.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>He is as wise as brave. Was ever tale</L>
<L>With such a gallant modesty rehears'd?</L>
<L>My brave deliverer! thou shalt enter now</L>
<L>A nobler list, and in a monarch's sight</L>
<L>Contend with princes for the prize of fame.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="20"/>I will present thee to our Scottish king,</L>
<L>Whose valiant spirit ever valour lov'd.</L>
<L>Ha! my MATILDA! wherefore starts that tear?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I cannot say: for various affections,</L>
<L>And strangely mingled, in my bosom swell;</L>
<L>Yet each of them may well command a tear.</L>
<L>I joy that thou art safe; and admire</L>
<L>Him and his fortunes who hath wrought thy safety.</L>
<L>Obscure and friendless, he the army sought,</L>
<L>Bent upon peril, in the range of death</L>
<L>Resolv'd to hunt for fame, and with his sword</L>
<L>To gain distinction which his birth denied.</L>
<L>In this attempt unknown he might have perish'd,</L>
<L>And gain'd, with all his valour, but oblivion.</L>
<L>Now grac'd by thee, his virtue serves no more</L>
<L>Beneath despair. The soldier now of hope</L>
<L>He stands conspicuous; fame and great renown</L>
<L>Are brought within the compass of his sword.</L>
<L>On this my mind reflected, whilst you spoke,</L>
<L>And bless'd the wonder-working Lord of heaven.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts!</L>
<L>My deeds shall follow where thou point'st the way.</L>
<L>Next to myself, and equal to GLENALVON,</L>
<L>In honour and command shall NORVAL be.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NORVAL.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know not how to thank you. Rude I am,</L>
<L>In speech and manners: never till this hour</L>
<L>Stood I in such a presence: yet, my lord,</L>
<L>There's something in my breast which makes me bold</L>
<L>To say, that NORVAL ne'er will shame thy favour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will be sworn thou wilt not. Thou shalt be</L>

<L>Impatient, doubtless, of their lord's delay.</L>
<L>Go with me, NORVAL, and thine eyes shall see</L>

<L>His parting words have struck a fatal truth.</L>
<L>O DOUGLAS! DOUGLAS! tender was the time</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="22"/>When we two parted, ne'er to meet again!</L>
<L>How many years of anguish and despair</L>
<L>Has heav'n annex'd to those swift passing hours</L>

<L>Wretch that I am! Alas! why am I so?</L>
<L>At every happy parent I repine!</L>
<L>How blest the mother of yon gallant NORVAL!</L>
<L>She for a living husband bore her pains,</L>

<L>She nurs'd her smiling infant on her breast;</L>
<L>Tended the child, and rear'd the pleasing boy:</L>
<L>She, with affection's triumph, saw the youth</L>
<L>In grace and comeliness surpass his peers:</L>

<L>Alas! alas! why will you thus resume</L>

<L>Delighted say'st thou? Oh! even there mine eye</L>

<L>Whom love transports beyond strict virtue's bounds,</L>
<L>If he is brought by love to misery,</L>
<L>In fortune ruin'd, as in mind forlorn,</L>
<L>Unpitied cannot be. Pity's the alms</L>

<L>A little hovel by the river's side</L>
<L>Receiv'd us: there hard labour, and the skill</L>
<L>In fishing, which was formerly my sport,</L>
<L>Supported life. Whilst thus we poorly liv'd,</L>
<L>One stormy night, as I remember well,</L>
<L>The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof:</L>
<L>Red came the river down, and loud and oft</L>
<L>The angry spirit of the water shrick'd.</L>
<L>At the dead hour of night was heard the cry</L>
<L>Of one in jeopardy. I rose, and ran</L>
<L>To where the circling eddy of a pool</L>
<L>Beneath the ford, us'd oft to bring within</L>
<L>My reach whatever floating thing the stream</L>
<L>Had caught. The voice was ceas'd; the person lost:</L>
<L>But looking sad and earnest on the waters,</L>
<L>By the moon's light I saw, whirl'd round and round,</L>
<L>A basket: soon I drew it to the bank,</L>

<L>Beyond all question. If impairing time</L>

<L>Beneath a mountain's brow, the most remote</L>

<L>A hermit liv'd; a melancholy man,</L>
<L>Who was the wonder of our wand'ring swains.</L>
<L>Austere and lonely, cruel to himself,</L>
<L>Did they report him; the cold earth his bed,</L>
<L>Water his drink, his food the shepherd's alms.</L>
<L>I went to see him, and my heart was touch'd</L>
<L>With reverence and pity. Mild he spake,</L>
<L>And, entring on discourse, such stories told</L>
<L>As made me oft revisit his sad cell.</L>
<L>For he had been a soldier in his youth;</L>
<L>And fought in famous battles, when the peers</L>
<L>Of Europe, by the bold GODFREDO led,</L>
<L>Against th' usurping Infidel display'd</L>
<L>The cross of Christ, and won the Holy Land.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with my admiration, and the fire</L>

<L>His years away, and act his young encounters:</L>
<L>Then, having shew'd his wounds, he'd sit him down,</L>
<L>And all the live-long day discourse of war.</L>

<L>Already is the idle gaping croud,</L>
<L>The spiteful vulgar, come to gaze on RANDOLPH.</L>
<L>Begone.</L>

<SPEAKER>NORVAL.</SPEAKER>
<L>I fear thee not. I will not go.</L>
<L>Here I'll remain. I'm an accomplice, Lord,</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="73"/>With thee in murder. Yes, my sins did help</L>
<L>To crush down to the ground this lovely plant.</L>
<L>O noblest youth that ever yet was born!</L>
<L>Sweetest and best, gentlest and bravest spirit,</L>
<L>That ever bless'd the world! Wretch that I am,</L>
<L>Who saw that noble spirit swell and rise</L>
<L>Above the narrow limits that confin'd it!</L>
<L>Yet never was by all thy virtues won</L>
<L>To do thee justice, and reveal the secret,</L>
<L>Which timely known, had rais'd thee far above</L>
<L>The villain's snare. Oh! I am punish'd now!</L>
<L>These are the hairs that should have strew'd the ground,</L>
<L>And not the locks of DOUGLAS.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Tears his hair, and throws himself upon the ground.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know thee now: thy boldness I forgive:</L>
<L>My crest is fallen. For thee I will appoint</L>
<L>A place of rest, if grief will let thee rest.</L>
<L>I will reward, altho' I cannot punish.</L>
<L>Curst, curst GLENALVON, he escap'd too well,</L>
<L>Tho' slain and baffled by the hand he hated.</L>
<L>Foaming with rage and fury to the last,</L>
<L>Cursing his conqueror, the felon dy'd.</L>

<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord, my Lord!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Speak: I can hear of horror.</L>

<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Horror indeed!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>MATILDA?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is no more:</L>
<L>She ran, she flew like light'ning up the hill,</L>
<L>Nor halted till the precipice she gain'd,</L>
<L>Beneath whose low'ring top the river falls</L>
<L>Ingulph'd in rifted rocks: thither she came,</L>
<L>As fearless as the eagle lights upon it,</L>
<L>And headlong down. —</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas I! alas! 'twas I</L>
<L>That fill'd her breast with fury; drove her down</L>
<L>The precipice of death! Wretch that I am!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>O had you seen her last despairing look!</L>
<L>Upon the brink she stood, and cast her eyes</L>
<L>Down on the deep: then lifting up her head</L>
<L>And her white hands to heaven, seeming to say,</L>
<L>Why am I forc'd to this? She plung'd herself</L>
<L>Into the empty air.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will not vent,</L>
<L>In vain complaints, the passion of my soul.</L>
<L>Peace in this world I never can enjoy.</L>
<L>These wounds the gratitude of RANDOLPH gave.</L>
<L>They speak aloud, and with the voice of fate</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="75"/>Denounce my doom. I am resolv'd. I'll go</L>
<L>Straight to the battle, where the man that makes</L>
<L>Me turn aside must threaten worse than death.</L>
<L>Thou, faithful to thy mistress, take this ring,</L>
<L>Full warrant of my power. Let every rite</L>
<L>With cost and pomp upon their funerals wait:</L>
<L>For RANDOLPH hopes he never shall return.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. BARRY.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>AN Epilogue I ask'd; but not one word</L>
<L>Our bard will write. He vows 'tis most absurd</L>
<L>With comick wit to contradict the strain</L>
<L>Of tragedy, and make your sorrows vain.</L>
<L>Sadly he says, that pity is the best,</L>
<L>And noblest passion of the human breast:</L>
<L>For when its sacred streams the heart o'er-flow,</L>
<L>In gushes pleasure with the tide of woe;</L>
<L>And when its waves retire, like those of <HI>Nile,</HI></L>
<L>They leave behind them such a golden soil,</L>
<L>That there the virtues without culture grow,</L>
<L>There the sweet blossoms of affection blow.</L>
<L>These were his words; void of delusive art</L>
<L>I felt them; for he spoke them from his heart.</L>
<L>Nor will I now attempt, with witty folly,</L>
<L>To chace away celestial melancholy.</L>
