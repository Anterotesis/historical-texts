<HEAD>THE PLUM-CAKES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A FARMER who some wealth possest,</L>
<L>With three fine boys was also blest;</L>
<L>The lads were healthy, stout, and young,</L>
<L>And neither wanted sense nor tongue.</L>
<L>Tom, Will, and Jack, like other boys,</L>
<L>Lov'd tops and marbles, sport and toys.</L>
<L>The father scouted that false plan,</L>
<L>That money only makes the man,</L>
<L>But, to the best of his discerning,</L>
<L>Was bent on giving them good learning:</L>
<L>He was a man of observation,</L>
<L>No scholar, yet had penetration;</L>
<L>So with due care, a school he sought,</L>
<L>Where his young sons might well be taught.</L>
<L>Quoth he, "I know not which rehearses</L>
<L>"Most properly his themes or verses,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
"Yet I can do a father's part,</L>
<L>"And school the temper, mind, and heart;</L>
<L>"The natural bent of each I'll know,</L>
<L>"And trifles best that bent may show."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas just before the closing year,</L>
<L>When Christmas holidays were near,</L>
<L>The farmer call'd to see his boys,</L>
<L>And ask'd how each his time employs.</L>
<L>Quoth Will, "there's father, boys without,</L>
<L>"He's brought us something good no doubt."</L>
<L>The father sees their merry faces,</L>
<L>With joy beholds them, and embraces.</L>
<L>"Come boys, of home you'll have your fill,"</L>
<L>"Yes, Christmas now is near," says Will,</L>
<L>"'Tis just twelve days—these notches see,</L>
<L>"My notches with the days agree.</L>
<L>"Well," said the sire, "again I'll come,</L>
<L>"And gladly fetch my brave boys home.</L>
<L>"You two the dappled mare shall ride,</L>
<L>"Jack mount the poney by his side;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
"Mean time, my lads, I've brought you here,</L>
<L>"No small provision of good cheer."</L>
<L>Then from his pockets strait he takes,</L>
<L>A vast profusion of plum-cakes;</L>
<L>He counts them out, a plenteous store,</L>
<L>No boy shall have or less or more;</L>
<L>Twelve cakes he gives to each dear son,</L>
<L>When each expected only one;</L>
<L>And then, with many a kind expression,</L>
<L>He leaves them to their own discretion,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to mark the use each made</L>
<L>Of what he to their hands convey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The twelve days past he comes once more,</L>
<L>And brings the horses to the door;</L>
<L>The boys with rapture see appear,</L>
<L>The poney and the dappled mare;</L>
<L>Each moment now an hour they count,</L>
<L>And slash their whips and long to mount.</L>
<L>As with the boys his ride he takes,</L>
<L>He asks the history of the cakes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<L>Says Will, "dear father, life is short,</L>
<L>"So I resolved to make quick sport;</L>
<L>"The cakes were all so nice and sweet,</L>
<L>"I thought I'd have one jolly treat,</L>
<L>"Why should I balk, said I, my taste?</L>
<L>"I'll make at once a hearty feast.</L>
<L>"So, snugly by myself I fed,</L>
<L>"When every boy was gone to-bed;</L>
<L>"I gorg' them all, both paste and plum,</L>
<L>"And did not waste a single crumb;</L>
<L>"Indeed they made me, to my sorrow,</L>
<L>"As sick as death upon the morrow;</L>
<L>"This made me mourn my rich repast,</L>
<L>"And wish I had not fed so fast."</L>
<L>Quoth Jack, "I was not such a dunce,</L>
<L>"To eat my quantum up at once;</L>
<L>"And tho' the boys all long'd to clutch 'em,</L>
<L>"I would not let a creature touch 'em;</L>
<L>"Nor tho' the whole were in my power,</L>
<L>"Would I myself one cake devour;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
"Thanks to the use of keys and locks,</L>
<L>"They're all now snug within my box:</L>
<L>"The mischief is, by hoarding long,</L>
<L>"They're grown so mouldy and so strong,</L>
<L>"I find they won't be fit to eat,</L>
<L>"And I have lost my father's treat."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Well Tom," the anxious parent cries,</L>
<L>"How did you manage?" Tom replies,</L>
<L>"I shun'd each wide extreme to take,</L>
<L>"To glut my maw, or hoard my cake;</L>
<L>"I thought each day its wants wou'd have,</L>
<L>"And appetite again might crave;</L>
<L>"Twelve school-days still my notches counted,</L>
<L>"To twelve my father's cakes amounted;</L>
<L>"So every day I took out one,</L>
<L>"But never ate my cake alone;</L>
<L>"With every needy boy I shar'd,</L>
<L>"And more than half I always spar'd.</L>
<L>"One ev'ry day 'twixt self and friend,</L>
<L>"Has brought my dozen to an end;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
"My last remaining cake to-day,</L>
<L>"I wou'd not touch but gave away;</L>
<L>"A boy was sick, and scarce cou'd eat,</L>
<L>"To him it prov'd a welcome treat;</L>
<L>"Jack called me spendthrift, not to save,</L>
<L>"Will dubb'd me fool because I gave;</L>
<L>"But when our last day came I smil'd,</L>
<L>"For Will's were gone, and Jack's were spoil'd;</L>
<L>"Not hoarding much nor eating fast,</L>
<L>"I serv'd a needy friend at last."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These tales the father's thoughts employ;</L>
<L>"By these," said he, "I know each boy:</L>
<L>"Yet Jack, who hoarded what he had,</L>
<L>"The world will call a frugal lad;</L>
<L>"And selfish gormandising Will,</L>
<L>"Will meet with friends and favours still;</L>
<L>"While moderate Tom so wise and cool,</L>
<L>"The mad and vain will deem a fool;</L>
<L>"But I, his sober plan approve,</L>
<L>"And Tom has gain'd his father's love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<L>So when our day of life is past,</L>
<L>And all are fairly judg'd at last;</L>
<L>The miser and the sensual find,</L>
<L>How each misus'd the gifts assign'd;</L>
<L>While he who wisely spends and gives,</L>
<L>To the true ends of living, lives,</L>
<L>'Tis self denying moderation,</L>
<L>Gains the GREAT FATHER'S approbation.</L>
