<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, terrible as the idea is, I believe I shall prefer a convent to your brother, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you will not, my dear.—My brother has chiefly resided in his native province, has been several times in Spain, and is lately come to Paris, the intrigues of which have been most tremen∣dously described to him—His head is whimsical, but his heart is good.</P>

<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have almost as much reason to fear his jealous caprices as I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>More—The excellence of your principles, and propriety of your conduct when married will soon cure him of suspicion; but I am in instantaneous danger; he insists on my immediate marriage with that ridiculous Spanish doctor, Don Decrepito.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you are in love with this Englishman, the generous Sidney.</P>

<P>With my consent, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DU-CHESNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you had kindly granted, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You rely, perhaps, on the commands of my family; but those would be ineffectual, I assure you, Sir, if I did not persuade myself your pre∣sent humour would be of short duration.</P>

<SPEAKER>DU-CHESNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was generous enough, Madam, to rely on yourself.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not rely on me too, brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DU-CHESNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have my reasons.—Every man in Paris is by profession a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is really a charming place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DU-CHESNE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shall be my care, however, that none of them shall enter this house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be your care, I'm afraid, to make your∣self their jest. Virtue, Sir, is a better security than prisons.</P>

<P>I will have both securities.</P>

<P>Lord, Madam, you have such convincing reasons. <STAGE>(Exit.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you wish to know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I should not wonder if my enamoured Englishman, and his crafty valet, La-fourbe, were themselves to personate this Smith and Mason; I will watch for them through the window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, indeed! How can they gain intelligence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see the mercenary temper of Parisian servants, and know their unconquerable pro∣pensity to tattle and intrigue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and your brother knows it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sidney has planted his emissaries, by whose aid he gains intelligence, not only from my maid Marinette, whenever she can find op∣portunity, but from this Picard, and his fellow∣servant, Antoine, of every thing that passes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I may aid you more effectually, you must instruct me how I may become acquainted with your lover.</P>

<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will find some means of sending him to you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you had better not; I shall perhaps prefer him to this jealous brother of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not fear you, girl—I flatter myself, he sincerely loves me. Besides, he is an English∣man, and piques himself on his fidelity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURETTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he has not been long at Paris. However rich in money, and sincerity, your prodigal Englishmen may come to this city, they gene∣rally return bankrupts in both. <STAGE>(Exit.)</STAGE></P>

<P>I wish you were delighted with your future husband.</P>

<SPEAKER>ROSALIE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my dear Doctor Decrepito!—Oh! the charming Adonis—His nine hairs on each side his bald pate, so bepowdered; his sallow face, grisly beard, and bristly eyebrows, are all so bewitching! So gallant too in his dress! Dis∣daining flannels, and shivering in summer silks.—Such easy elegance of carriage, his gait so up∣right,

his manners so polished, and his language so eloquent. Oh! the delightful creature!</P>
