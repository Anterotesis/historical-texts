<P>PERMIT me to assure YOUR GRACE of the deep sense I retain of Your great Goodness and Condescension in the Protection which You have been pleased to extend to my first Effort in the Drama.</P>
<P>Were I to listen to those suggestions that natu∣rally arise in the mind of a Writer, on the first dawnings of success, the favourable reception which this Tragedy has met with from the Public would lead me to hope that it might not be found wholly unworthy of YOUR GRACE'S Patronage: but when I reflect how many circumstances con∣tribute to please on the Stage, where every Thought
<PB REF="4"/>or Expression is enforced with the graces of action and utterance, I cannot but be anxious lest the Reader should withhold that approbation in the closet which the Spectator testified in the representation.</P>
<P>It is with the utmost Deference I submit the following Scenes to YOUR GRACE'S Perusal; and am,</P>

<L>NEW to the stage, before this dread array,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to offer here his virgin play,</L>
<L>Our tim'rous Author, diffident of praise,</L>
<L>Grafts his first laurels on another's bays;</L>
<L>Takes from another's breast the gen'rous fire,</L>
<L>And fits to English strains a foreign lyre:</L>
<L>Aspires to please by unsuspected means,</L>
<L>Importing passion from Italian scenes;</L>
<L>Where heroes combate to soft music's note;</L>
<L>And tyrants warble thro' an eunuch's throat:</L>
<L>To symphony despairing lovers sigh;</L>
<L>And struggling traitors by the gamut die!</L>
<L>Yet here a living bard, whose fame out-runs</L>
<L>The foremost of the tunesul Drama's sons,</L>
<L>Can ev'n in song his magic pow'r dispense,</L>
<L>At once uniting harmony and sense.</L>
<L>From him our poet now essays to write,</L>
<L>And plans from him the story of to-night;</L>
<L>A well-known tale—who has not heard the name:</L>
<L>Of CYRUS, and the rising Median fame?</L>
<L>Each puling school-boy can discuss the theme;</L>
<L>The suff'ring grandson, and the monarch's dream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! should his genius catch th' inspiring thought,</L>
<L>And nobly copy what was nobly wrought;</L>
<L>Or where the master's hand but sketch'd the line,</L>
<L>With happy warmth fill up the bold design;</L>
<L>Then ev'ry figure, with full force imprest,</L>
<L>May wake the feelings of th' impassion'd breast;</L>
<L>While each bright eye, amidst this circle, pays</L>
<L>The tribute of involuntary praise.</L>

<L>Here shall I meet again my long lost Cyrus:</L>

<SPEAKER>CYRUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of this, Mithranes,</L>
<L>Thou need'st not speak; oft have I heard it told,</L>
<L>How, from his dream, the magic had denounc'd,</L>
<L>That of Mandane should a child be born,</L>
<L>That must one day deprive him of his throne;</L>
<L>And well I know at Cyrus' luckless birth,</L>
<L>The rigid charge was given to Harpagus,</L>
<L>To end his life, and ease a monarch's fears,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MITHRANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>From thence begins a tale thou ne'er hast heard:</L>
<L>The cruel sentence Harpagus receiv'd,</L>
<L>His heart refus'd to obey; to me he brought thee,</L>
<L>Wrapp'd in a regal mantle.</L>

<L>Not so—be patient—</L>
<L>My consort then (mark well the providence</L>
<L>That watch'd thy preservation) had brought forth</L>
<L>A lifeless child; thy harmless innocence</L>
<L>Excited pity; on thy tender cheek</L>
<L>Stood the big tear, as if thy heart already</L>

<L>My Barce wept, and with a mother's fondness,</L>

<L>As my own son I bred thee in these shades,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CYRUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of Astyages?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MITHRANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>When he believ'd</L>
<L>His dire command compleated, nature's voice</L>
<L>At length awaken'd in his breast remorse.</L>
<L>Full fifteen years did Harpagus remain</L>
<L>Without disclosing aught; then seem'd the tale</L>
<L>Ripe for discovery: yet he first would prove</L>
<L>The current's depth before he left the shore.</L>
<L>Five years have now elaps'd, since thro' the realm</L>
<L>The tidings spread, that Cyrus being found</L>
<L>An infant in the forest, was preserv'd</L>
<L>And liv'd among the Scythians: such report</L>
<L>Perhaps the impostor rais'd, or from the rumour</L>

<SPEAKER>MITHRANES.</SPEAKER>

<L>With joy receive the news, I safely may</L>
<L>Reveal the kingdom's heir; or should his fears</L>
<L>Once more return, and prompt some new design</L>
<L>Against the prince, the baffled aim will light</L>
<L>Upon the impostor's head.</L>

<SPEAKER>CYRUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>But since the king</L>
<L>Confesses now such tenderness for Cyrus;</L>
<L>At length recalls him from a life of exile,</L>
<L>To clasp him to his bosom, wakens all</L>
<L>The soft endearments in a mother's soul,</L>

<L>Wherefore should unavailing caution still</L>
<L>Withhold the secret from him?</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Harpagus</L>
<L>Relies not firmly on the royal goodness:</L>
<L>For when he own'd, that with compassion mov'd,</L>
<L>He had not slain the infant, but expos'd him</L>
<L>Amidst the woods, Astyages to punish</L>
<L>His disobedience, doom'd to cruel death</L>
<L>His only son; and though the king now seems</L>
<L>To mourn his grandson's fate, and wears the semblance</L>
<L>Of deep remorse, yet sure but ill agrees</L>

<L>Ev'n 'midst these rude uncultivated wilds,</L>

<L>I stop'd him short—perhaps it may be true,</L>
<L>That your old nature differs from your new.</L>
<L>From various causes equal sorrows flow,</L>
<L>All realms and times have some peculiar woe:</L>
<L>With us what griefs from ills domestic rise,</L>
<L>When now a beau—and now a monkey dies!</L>
<L>In this our iron age, still harder lot,</L>
<L>A masquerade, no ticket to be got—</L>
<L>Your obsolete distress may now be told—</L>
<L>Let's see—there's ravishing—that's very old.</L>
<L>There's love that scorn'd a title and estate—</L>
<L>These woes of love are vastly ou? of date!</L>
<L>Then there's your martyr to his country's weal—</L>
<L>What strange distress these ancients us'd to seel!</L>
<L>The love of country now indeed runs high;</L>
<L>They prove its value most, who dearest buy;</L>
<L>Think what our patriots pay in sterling gold,</L>
<L>A single borough for seven years to hold.</L>
<L>Tho' here in <HI>statu quo</HI> I still remain,</L>
<L>I've oft been married, ravish'd, erown'd and slain!</L>
<L>None of all these have been my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to-night,</L>
<L>So us'd to fancy'd angu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>light;</L>
<L>Yet let me hope you felt the part I bore,</L>
<L>Give me your plaudit—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can wish no more.</L>
