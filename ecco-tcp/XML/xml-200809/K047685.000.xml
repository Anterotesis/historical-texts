<L>On time's swift wing the dreadful hour is come!</L>

<L>In sackcloth follow—Hark! the dirge of death. <STAGE>Solemn music</STAGE>.</L>
<L>It ceases—and now awful silence reigns</L>
<L>O'er all the prostrate crowd. The victims now,</L>
<L>(Alas! their sands are few) look round aghast;</L>
<L>And now their eyes are veil'd to gaze no more:</L>
<L>They lift their trembling hands, and give the sign!</L>
