<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE subject of this poem is founded on a cir∣cumstance that happened during the late war.— A young lady, not meeting with the concurrence of her relations in favour of an officer for whom she expressed her regard, was prevailed upon, by his solicitations, to consent to a clandestine mar∣riage; which took place on the day he sat out to join his regiment abroad, where he was unfortu∣nately killed in an engagement.</P>

<HEAD>AMABELLA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HARMODIUS breath'd the rural air, nor found</L>
<L>His ruddy health with length of years decrease:</L>
<L>By duty prompted, AMABELLA crown'd,</L>
<L>His silver forehead with the wreath of peace:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BY partial nature fram'd in beauty's mould,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with ev'ry grace, unspoil'd by art,</L>
<L>To friendship's circle still did she unfold,</L>
<L>The lovelier beauties of a feeling heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<L>ENDEAR'D to all she met, each welcome day,</L>
<L>By fortune's hand, with various blessings fraught:</L>
<L>When, lo! her gayety's accustom'd ray</L>
<L>Was quench'd, untimely, with the gloom of thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT fix'd the bosom-thorn, affliction knows,</L>
<L>Where peace sat brooding as the gentle dove:</L>
<L>What blasted on her cheek the summer rose,</L>
<L>Or slow disease, or unsuccessful love,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>REMAIN'D unknown.—'Twas by the many guess'd,</L>
<L>That love to her soft vows had prov'd unkind:</L>
<L>Beyond the pow'r of her weak frame oppress'd,</L>
<L>Insanity o'erthrew her lovely mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<L>AT length recov'ring, yet to grief devote,</L>
<L>To solitude she gave th' unsocial day;</L>
<L>Like a pale vot'ry from the world remote,</L>
<L>Uncheer'd, unvisited of pleasure's ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OFT did HARMODIUS (at her state dismay'd)</L>
<L>Solicit from his child her secret pain:</L>
<L>Her vague reply still from his question stray'd,</L>
<L>And each repeated effort prov'd in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To speed the moments of the loit'ring hour,</L>
<L>And by their plaintive strains perchance allur'd,</L>
<L>Within a spacious myrtle-woven bow'r,</L>
<L>Two turtle doves the pensive fair secur'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<L>"YE little captives, wou'd she often say,</L>
<L>"Tho' here secluded from the fields of air,</L>
<L>"Thro' yonder vernal grove forbid to stray,</L>
<L>"And join the kindred train that wanton there;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"'GAINST you the gunner never lifts his arm,</L>
<L>"Nor o'er this mansion does the falcon sail;</L>
<L>"You live unconscious of the storm's alarm,</L>
<L>"The rain impetuous, and the beating hail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"NOR here, by kind compassion unimpress'd,</L>
<L>"The school-boy ever rears his impious hand,</L>
<L>"To fill with agony the feather'd breast,</L>
<L>"And raze the little domes that love had plan'd."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<L>THEIR harmless joys disease too soon effac'd:</L>
<L>One fatal morn, her Turturella's mate</L>
<L>She found, with flagging wing subdued, oppress'd,</L>
<L>And just sinking at the blow of fate:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILE down her cheek compassion's show'r distill'd,</L>
<L>She gently rais'd it to her anxious breast;</L>
<L>But death's cold blast life's crimson current chill'd,</L>
<L>And thus the fair her breathless bird address'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"ILL-FATED turtle, round whose peaceful bow'r,</L>
<L>"The jocund loves so lately wont to play:</L>
<L>"How sunk, alas! in youth's exulting hour,</L>
<L>"To fell disease, to death th' untimely prey:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<L>"How silent is the voice, which, void of art,</L>
<L>"Along the tender day was heard to coo!</L>
<L>"How still, how frozen is the constant heart,</L>
<L>"Which to its dear companion beat so true!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"THAT dear companion, that now widow'd dove,</L>
<L>"To screen from every harm, be mine the care;</L>
<L>"And, while she mourns her ne'er reviving love,</L>
<L>"Her grief to me the mourner will endear:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"LIKE thee, a widow too, condemn'd to mourn:</L>
<L>"No more to me does life unfold its charms,</L>
<L>"Death, death forbids him ever to return!"</L>
<L>She said—and sunk into th' attendant's arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
<L>HER swift relapsing to her former state,</L>
<L>With boding fears, approach'd the serving train:</L>
<L>This scene's dread period tremblingly they wait,</L>
<L>Nor were their boding fears indulg'd in vain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AWAKNING from her trance, around she threw,</L>
<L>Distressful fair, her much disorder d deyes;</L>
<L>And wild'ring said—"repeat that kind adieu:</L>
<L>"Ah no! from love to war, to death he flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"DID ye not hear the clash of hostile spears?</L>
<L>"Ah! mark ye not that breast-plate stain'd with gore?</L>
<L>"What groan was that which pearc'd these fearful ears?</L>
<L>He falls, he falls—my warrior is no more:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
<L>"NOR was, Oh heav'n! his AMABELLA near,</L>
<L>"To sooth his Pain and echo sigh to sigh,</L>
<L>"Drop on the gaping wound a balmy tear,</L>
<L>"Kiss his cold lip, and close his fading eye."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OF her distress th' alarm'd HARMODIUS taught,</L>
<L>With trembling steps approach'd th' unconscious fair:</L>
<L>"Give me, he cried, with grief paternal fraught,</L>
<L>"Give me, Oh AMABEL'! to sooth thy care:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"SAY what affliction has thy soul impress d?</L>
<L>"Reveal what storm thy bosom'd calmness breaks?</L>

<L>"AH what avails the praise the brave obtain!</L>

<L>"HER roving thought no trace of reason bears:</L>
