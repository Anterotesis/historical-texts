<HEAD>Advertisement.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to inform the Reader, that the most Part of the following Pieces were wrote without any Design of their ever appearing in Print; the Author's Consciousness of the Disadvantage he lay un∣der, hindering him from aspiring to the Rank of a Poet: But the generous Encou∣ragement he met with from some Persons of Distinction, to whom he had the Honour of being made known, determined him to offer his Productions to the Publick. It will be needless, perhaps, to declare, that he has had no Assistance from Learning. He takes this Opportunity of returning Thanks to all his Subscribers, and generous Benefactors, de∣claring his Ambition to extend no farther, than that of producing something not alto∣gether unworthy their Countenance and Favour.</P>

<L>The Subject only can support the Voice.</L>
<L>Illustrious Guest! whose happy Wisdom's known</L>

<L><PB N="2" REF="30"/>
Whose Tongue inspir'd an unresolving State,</L>

<L>Fir'd with the Glories of thy splendid Name,</L>
<L>Thro' various Climates still pursu'd by Fame,</L>
<L>To thee a Muse, untaught in <HI>Latian</HI> Lays,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Grecian</HI> Stile, her Voice obscure would raise;</L>
<L>Wrapt in the Theme sublime, would proudly soar,</L>
<L>And sound thy Welcome to her native Shore.</L>
<L>Thee even Factions with one Voice require,</L>
<L>And Heav'n and <HI>George</HI> indulge the strong Desire.</L>
<L>See bending Crowds with willing Hearts obey,</L>
<L>And grateful own the delegated Sway.</L>
<L>Tho' ne'er great <HI>Brunswick</HI> to <HI>Hibernia</HI> rise,</L>
<L>But shines afar, and gladens other Skies;</L>
<L>His godlike Pow'r beneficent we view,</L>
<L>Effulgent, and reflected all from you.</L>
<L>Lo, thus the Silver Substitute of Day,</L>
<L>Supplies his Absence with a borrow'd Ray;</L>
<L>O'er the gay Globe with gentle Beam presides;</L>
<L>Chears the wild Waste, and rules the teeming Tides;</L>

Whose heaving Bosom swells the publick Store</L>

<L>Salute the Dawnings of the gladsome Spring;</L>
<L>Their pouring Throats employ from Spray to Spray,</L>
<L>To greet the Sun, and bless the genial Day.</L>
<L>Each raptur'd Muse shall now resume her Lyre,</L>
<L>Swell the full Chords, and sweep the sounding Wyre:</L>

<L>Tho' <HI>Congreve, Steel, Roscommon,</HI> are no more;</L>

<L>Nor you, great Sir, on these weak Numbers frown,</L>
<L>Which mourn a <HI>Swift,</HI> and sing thy just Renown:</L>
<L>Such Strains, alas! as my unletter'd Hand,</L>
<L>Trembling would reach thee on the crowded Strand:</L>
<L>But thronging Thousands intercept my Way,</L>
<L>And deaf'ning Io's drown my feeble Lay.</L>
<L>Yet, if a Moment from the Toils of State,</L>
<L>And all the Burthen of a Kingdom's Weight,</L>
<L>Some little Leisure to the Muse you lend,</L>
<L>(Each leisure Moment is the Muse's Friend)</L>

<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the Countess of <HI>CHFS∣TERFIELD,</HI> occasioned by her procuring a Pardon for two Soldiers condemned for Desertion.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHat means this dismal Sound, that March so slow,</L>
<L>This solemn Sadness, and this Pomp of Woe?</L>
<L>Behold two Victims pale and trembling led,</L>
<L>Already number'd with th' unheeded Dead!</L>
<L>What ghastly Terrors on each Brow we trace!</L>
<L>See Death imprinted on each dying Face!</L>
<L>Yet Love of Life asserts its eager Claim,</L>
<L>But Hope, alas! affords no flatt'ring Gleam.</L>
<L>Lo! the pale King in horrid Pomp appears:</L>
<L>What cruel Eye could then refrain from Tears?</L>
<L>What Heart relentless then forbear to melt?</L>
<L>Who saw their Sorrows, but like Sorrows felt?</L>
<L>How sad the Conflict, how severe the Strife</L>
<L>Of Wretches clinging to the Verge of Life!</L>
<L>When angry Justice claim'd her promis'd Prey,</L>
<L>And frown'd vindictive on the kind Delay;</L>

Thy saving Mercy in that Moment flew,</L>
<L>(The darling Attribute of Heav'n and You)</L>
<L>To soft Compassion won thy willing Lord,</L>
<L>His Justice temp'ring sheath'd th' uplifted Sword;</L>
<L>And, in that dismal, that tremendous Hour,</L>
<L>Snatch'd the pale Victims from th' offended Pow'r.</L>

<L>He views th' Abyss, and as he views, despairs;</L>
<L>'Till some unhop'd-for Hand prevents his Doom,</L>
<L>Lifts him to Life, and lengthen'd Years to come:</L>
<L>Redeem'd from Fate, nor yet restor'd to Life,</L>

<L>A Youth whom Folly long had led aside,</L>
<L>Was bless'd with Reason, but o'er-run with Pride:</L>
<L>His Mind with Judgment and with Sense was fraught;</L>
<L>Piercing his Wit, sagacious was his Thought;</L>
<L>By Nature fitted to discern aright,</L>
<L>Whilst Science sharpen'd and improv'd his Sight:</L>

<L>He walk'd the Path which led him wide astray:</L>
<L>An ill Example his strong Passion sways,</L>
<L>The foul Infection on his Morals preys:</L>
<L>Religion mock'd he daily hears and sees,</L>
<L>Endures it first, then likes it by Degrees;</L>
<L>Till with the potent Poison all o'erspread,</L>
<L>His Conscience slumbers, and his Fears are fled.</L>
<L>Now plung'd in Vice, he feels no Pang within,</L>
<L>But sports with Death, and basks secure in Sin:</L>

With horrid Blasphemies is nightly pleas'd:</L>
<L>A dying Saviour, and a God appeas'd,</L>

<L>When Wit runs wanton in the mad Mis-rule:</L>
<L>Religion fled, had left no feeble Trace;</L>
<L>Nor in his Heart remain'd one Mark of Grace.</L>
<L>Perverse, forlorn, O Death, he's wholly thine,</L>
<L>A rip'ning Victim to the Wrath Divine;</L>
<L>The angry Bolt in Heaven's right Hand grows red,</L>
<L>And aims Destruction at his guilty Head,</L>
<L>When gracious Providence with Smile serene,</L>
<L>Bade melting Mercy gently step between.</L>
<L>Some Angel guides him with celestial Care,</L>

<L>Now Hope and Fear are in his Heart at Strife,</L>

<L>Virtue and Truth resume their native Place,</L>
<L>And Vice and Error now resign to Grace;</L>
<L>Convinc'd, subdu'd, the yielding Convert stands,</L>

<L>Not <HI>Indian</HI> Treasures yield so bright a Crown;</L>
<L>Not conquer'd Worlds can claim such true Renown.</L>

<L>At distance far he faintly views,</L>
<L>Then inward sighs, and blames the Muse:</L>
