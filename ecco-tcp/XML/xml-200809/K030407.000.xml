<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE success of a Dramatic piece on the Stage, depends, says Voltaire, upon accidental circumstan∣ces, but the day of publication decides its fate.</P>
<P>Persuaded of the truth of this remark, the Author of the Tragedy of Alfred would have submitted his performance, to the final judgment of the Reader, without preface or apology, if he had not been ad∣vised, and indeed urged, to make a reply to some hostile criticisms, which appear to have been founded upon prejudice and opinion, rather than reason and argument.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that the character of Al∣fred, in the Tragedy, does not agree with the cha∣racter of Alfred in History: "That the Hero, the Legislator, is degraded to a Lover, who enters the Danish camp, from a private, not a public, mo∣tive, and acts the part of an impostor."</P>
<P>In Tragedy, if the subject be Historical, an au∣thor is not permitted to introduce events, contrary
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
to the great established facts of History; for in∣stance, in the Tragedy of Alfred, the Hero must not be killed, nor driven out of England by the Danes; but preserving those ancient foundations, as the piers of his bridge, the Author may bend his arches, and finish the fabrick, according to his taste and fancy, for the poet is at liberty, and it is the es∣sence of his art, to invent such intermediate circum∣stances, and incidents, as he thinks will produce the most affecting situations. In this department, the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing, but pro∣bability and consistence of character, the barriers of dramatic truth. Let us apply this principle to the point in dispute.</P>
<P>Alfred was a young man, when he fought the battle of Ethendune. The victory, which gave him possession of the kingdom, must have been gained before he begun to model the state, Is it im∣probable to suppose, that a young hero was in love? Is it inconsistent to represent the person, who was a Legislator when advanced in years, as a lover in his youth! Does it degrade the character of a hero to suppose, that he was in love with the princess whom he afterwards married? Is it not rather in∣jurious to his heroism to conclude, that he chose a consort whom he did not love? If this reasoning is just, there will be no difficulty in vindicating the subsequent conduct of the hero. The dramatic and the real Alfred, are both involved in the charge of imposture; both entered the Danish camp in dis∣guise; the previous events, as narrated in the tra∣gedy, are nearly the same with those mentioned in history. Alfred, for almost two years, had wan∣dered thro' England, concealing himself under feign∣ed names and characters. He lived in the midst of his enemies, by being supposed to be dead. Emerg∣ing from this obscurity, he appears in the tragedy, and is informed of the alarming ambiguous situation of Ethelswida; his usual stratagems present them∣selves, one would think, naturally to his mind, ex∣tremely
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
agitated, and prone both by temper and habit, to the most daring and romantic enterprizes. He resolves to enter the Danish camp, to learn the fate of Ethelswida, and observe the strength and or∣der of the enemy's army, before he ventures a deci∣sive engagement.</P>
<P>The continued artifice is inevitable. The con∣duct of Alfred, in the camp of Hinguar; the man∣ner in which he deceives the Dane, is extremely similar to the conduct of Orestes in the Electra of Sophocles, which no critic hitherto has blamed. Orestes enters the palace of Aegisthus, as the mes∣senger of his own death, carrying an urn, which contains (he says) the ashes of Orestes, whose un∣timely fate he most circumstantially relates. The Grecian hero practises the deceit with an intention to kill the persons whom he deceives. The English hero deceives Hinguar only to gain access to Ethels∣wida, without meaning to hurt the person of his enemy. To praise Sophocles, and blame the author of Alfred, for the same conduct, seems a direct contradiction, which can only be accounted for, in one way; an imaginary idea has been formed of the character of Alfred as an old mortified, ascetic sage, of spirit too sublime and aetherial to descend to hu∣man passions or human actions. But the real as well as the dramatic Alfred was a young hero, a bard, a winner of battles, brave and magnanimous, but compelled by the pressure of those desperate times, in which he lived, to practise a thousand arts to exist by simulation and dissimulation. Whoever recollects and weighs these circumstances, will it is presumed readily pardon the artifice of Alfred, in the Tragedy, and acknowledge that the <HI>feigned</HI> in∣cidents of the piece are altogether consistent with the true. If not, the author must be contented to la∣bour under the imputation of an erroneous judgment, for he meant nothing less than to degrade the cha∣racter of Alfred; on the contrary, finding in the
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
records of a remote and barbarous age, a hero of great renown, but from the defect of his historians, involved in clouds and darkness:
<Q>Qui caput inter nubila condit.</Q>
he was tempted to seize his name, and display his character in new situations, connected with the old and well known events of his life and fortune. The play is printed as it was performed. An alter∣ation has been made, in one scene, and sent to the Theatre, which, if the Tragedy should be resumed or revived, may perhaps contribute to heighten its effect.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>To furnish a new Prologue for each Play,</L>
<L>To dress the self-same dish, a different way;</L>
<L>Exhausts the poet's art. And every year,</L>
<L>Palates grow nicer, rarities more dear.</L>
<L>The cabinet, who in the green room sit,</L>
<L>The secret junto of the realm of wit;</L>
<L>In these hard times, resolved their stock to spare,</L>
<L>And crib the Prologue from the bill of fare.</L>
<L><HI>Alfred</HI> on English ground <HI>alone</HI> may stand,</L>
<L>The darling hero of his native land:</L>
<L><HI>No, no,</HI> our Poet cry'd<HI>—this is no time,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor is it prudent now to save your rhime;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Fir'd with my subject I have rashly dar'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And you in Prologue should protect your bard:</HI></L>
<L><HI>When my adventurous muse, indulg'd before,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Now vent'ring further, needs indulgence more;</HI></L>
<L><HI>She dares to trace the workings of a mind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The greatest and the best of human kind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Adjust its movements to dramatic plan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And blend the god-like hero with the man.</HI></L>
<L>The greater <HI>Alfred's</HI> fame, our bard risks more;</L>
<L>Such weight the flying courser never bore.</L>
<L><HI>Alfred!</HI> whose life such strange events adorn,</L>
<L>That history beholds romance with scorn;</L>
<L>Him to present, here in his native land,</L>
<L>Where still his genius, and his laws command,</L>
<L>Is an attempt like his, who rashly tried,</L>
<L>The burning chariot of the sun to guide!</L>
<L>Yet this attempt from admiration rose,</L>
<L>Nor should <HI>he</HI> find in <HI>Alfred</HI>'s kingdom foes:</L>
<L>He, who by temper led, not love of fame,</L>
<L>Is the fond echo of your hero's name.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY Mr. GARRICK.</BYLINE>
<L>OUR bards of late, so tragic in their calling,</L>
<L>Have scarce preserv'd one <HI>heroine</HI> from falling:</L>
<L>Whether the dame be widow, maid, or wife,</L>
<L>She seldom from <HI>their</HI> hands escapes with life:</L>
<L>If this green cloth could speak, would it not tell,</L>
<L>Upon its well-worn nap how oft I fell?</L>
<L>To death in various forms deliver'd up,</L>
<L>Steel kills me one night, and the next the <HI>Cup:</HI></L>
<L>The tragic process is as short, as certain;</L>
<L>With <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She makes the motion of stabbing.</NOTE> <HI>THIS,—</HI>or <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">And here of drinking po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on.</NOTE> <HI>THIS,</HI> I drop—then drops the curtain!</L>
<L>No saint can lead a better life than I,</L>
<L>For half is spent in study'ng how to die.</L>
<L>The learn'd dispute, how Tragedies should end;</L>
<L><HI>O happily</HI> say some—Some <HI>death</HI> defend:</L>
<L><HI>Mild</HI> criticks wish good fortune to the good;</L>
<L>While others <HI>hot-brain'd,</HI> roar for blood! blood! blood!—</L>
<L>The fair, tho' nervous, tragic to the soul,</L>
<L>Delights in daggers, and the poison'd bowl:</L>
<L><HI>"I would not give a black-pin for a Play,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Unless in tenderness I melt away:</HI></L>
<L><HI>"From pangs, and death no lovers would I save,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"They should be wretched, and despairand rave;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And ne'er together lie—but in the grave!"</HI></L>
<L>The brave <HI>rough soldier,</HI> a <HI>soft</HI> heart discovers;</L>
<L>He swears and weeps at once, when dead the lovers:</L>
<L>As down his cheeks run trickling nature's tide,</L>
<L><HI>"Damn it—I wish those young ones had not dy'd:"</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="8"/>
Tho' from his eyes the drop of pity falls,</L>
<L>He fights like <HI>Caesar,</HI> when his country calls:</L>
<L>In spite of critic laws, our bard takes part,</L>
<L>And joins in concert with the soldier's heart:</L>
<L>O let <HI>your</HI> feelings with his party side,</L>
<L>For once forgive me that I have not dy'd;</L>
<L>Too hard that fate, which kills a <HI>virgin bride.</HI></L>

<L>Who can unfold the cause? Why, at this hour,</L>
<L>When, big with England's fate, each moment rolls,</L>
<L>Does Alfred hide himself, in clouds and dark∣ness?</L>

<L>He spread them not.</L>
<L>From his uncertain fate, those rumours rose.</L>

<L>On Alfred's wedding day.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>It was believed,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEVONSHIRE.</SPEAKER>
<L>When faithless Hinguar, with his host, ad∣vanc'd,</L>
<L>The King, distracted for his lovely bride,</L>
<L>Sent off a hundred knights, by Surrey led,</L>
<L>To guard the Princess to a place of safety:</L>
<L>Then, furious, fac'd the Dane;—with odds op∣prest.</L>
<L>Around their King, his faithful nobles fell,</L>
<L>Alfred, by favour of the night, escap'd,</L>
<L>And wander'd long, obscure, from place to place.</L>
<L>Thro' woods and forests, like some beast of prey,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="12"/>
By cruel hunters chac'd. Much he endur'd;</L>
<L>And much his people suffer'd. English virtue,</L>
<L>Like England's oak, grew firmer from the storm.</L>
<L>Often the peasant his last morsel brought</L>
<L>To the dark wood or cave, where Alfred lay;</L>
<L>If questioned by the Dane, denied the deed;</L>
<L>And died, undaunted, to preserve his prince.</L>

<SPEAKER>OFFICER.</SPEAKER>
<L>The story▪ thrills my blood; by heaven and earth—</L>
<L>Where did he rest at last?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEVONSHIRE.</SPEAKER>
<L>He never rested;</L>
<L>Even when he had a place of refuge found;</L>
<L>Where the deep winding streams, Parret and Thone</L>
<L>Their waters mix, a little island lies,</L>
<L>With alders overgrown. No name it had,</L>
<L>Tho' now the name of Athelney it bears.</L>
<L>Marshes and pools, by inundation form'd,</L>
<L>Perplex the dire approach. There Alfred fix'd</L>
<L>His dreary habitation. Two brave knights</L>
<L>At first were all his train. Day after day</L>
<L>The numbers grew; and many a gallant knight,</L>
<L>Found out the wild asylum of his Lord.</L>
<L>From thence, with inroads fierce, they gall'd the Dane.</L>
<L>Dark as the spirits of the night they came,</L>
<L>And vanish'd at the dawn: In that retreat,</L>
<L>The sun, thro' every sign, o'er Alfred roll'd.</L>

<L>We reach'd a lonely mansion, in a dale,</L>

The Danes surpriz'd us in a narrow vale.</L>
<L>Against their fierce attack, our little band,</L>

<L>More and more narrow still the circle grew,</L>

<L>To die in battle is a warrior's death.</L>

<L>Hinguar has fought. From sea to sea, his sword,</L>

<L>The wolf and eagle followed to the feast,</L>

<L>No. Ethelswida fell</L>

<L>Her death delights me. Saxon, I rejoice</L>

<L>Compar'd with thine. To the Valkyrian maids</L>
<L>I go, to Odin and the hall of joy.</L>
<L>Thou of thy love bereft, shalt waste thy days,</L>
<L>In lamentation, like the wretch who pines</L>
