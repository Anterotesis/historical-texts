<P>HE'S MUCH TO BLAME, A COMEDY: IN FIVE ACTS.</P>
<P>AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN.</P>

<P>THE author of HE'S MUCH TO BLAME is in some small degree indebted to Le Complaisant, a comedy attributed to Monsieur De Ferriol Pont-de-Veyle, and to the tragedy of Clavigo by Goethe.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>PROLOGUES, in these sagacious days, must not</L>
<L>Repeat the story; and betray the plot:</L>
<L>For deep laid plots we sometimes have, no doubt:</L>
<L>'Tis pity you can't always find them out:</L>
<L>The secret must be kept; and not be told:</L>
<L>In this, at least, we beat the bards of old:</L>
<L>We can't endure our meaning you should guess,</L>
<L>And here again we boast complete success:</L>
<L>Cautious lest you the mystery should discover,</L>
<L>We keep you in the dark—till all is over.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since these important points we must not name,</L>
<L>The title let's discuss: He's much▪to blame!</L>
<L>To blame? Ay, surely; very much! But who.</L>
<L>The author. Well, that's nothing very new.</L>
<L>And what does blame induce? Why punishment.</L>
<L>Rashly we sin and leisurely repent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lured by that tempting bait a nine nights' bonus,</L>
<L>These scribbling sinners multiply upon us!</L>
<L>Then prologues write; to whine, cajole, and tickle:</L>
<L>Begging you'll burn the rod you've laid in pickle.</L>
<L>Shielding himself by these and such like arts,</L>
<L>He hopes to hurl with surer aim his darts.</L>
<L>But strike and cry, when we receive a blow,</L>
<L>Is arrant cowardice! I told him so.</L>
<L>He's mad, who would the field of battle tread;</L>
<L>Unless he hoped to have a broken head.</L>
<L>There's honor in such scars—he'll win and wear it▪</L>
<L>Then give him honor plenty! Never spare it.</L>
<L>But, should it be your pleasure not to quarrel,</L>
<L>He'll very kindly bear his load of laurel.</L>

<P>Would <HI>my</HI> injuries were all! But there are other and still deeper stabs. It is not yet ten months since I returned from India: my heart how light, my eve how cheerful, and my hand prompt at any commendable act. I could then be moved to joy, and sorrow, and every sympathising passion. Smiles and mock courtesy passed current on me, the word of man and woman was taken on trust, and I lived in the sunshine of an open unsuspect∣ing soul. But I am now otherwise taught. I am changed. My better part is brutalized; and the wrongs that lie rankling here have stripped me of human affections, and made me almost savage.</P>

a perfect calm. <STAGE>(Rises with important wisdom in his looks)</STAGE> Such were the maxims of Pyrrho, and his disciples; those renowned sages of antiquity! Well! And such too have been my maxims, practically. All my life have I been wavering, uncertain, and indeterminate! A sagacious sceptic without knowing it; and as it were by instinct! It was but lately I discovered what a wise man I am! And yet it seems to me as if I were scarcely half wise enough, for I am told that I am to doubt of every thing which I find rather difficult. For ex∣ample: that my wife Lady Vibrate is an extra∣vagant rackety rantipole woman of fashion, can I doubt that? No. That she squanders my money, disturbs my peace, and contradicts for contra∣diction's sake, can I doubt that? No. Then have I not a daughter to marry, a law suit to begin, and a thousand perplexing affairs so that I do not know which way to turn? Why all this appears true to me: but the sceptics teach that appearances deceive, and that nothing is certain. I may be Lord Vibrate, or I may be the Grand Turk. These doctrines are prodigiously deep. <STAGE>(Considers)</STAGE> But I must think of something else just now.

</SP>

<P>Impossible! Doubts here, doubts there, doubts every where. No rational man can be decided, on any point whatever. My doubts are my continual plagues: my whole life is con∣sumed by them,</P>

<P>It appears, my lord, you have conquered them on one subject.</P>

<P>Ay indeed! I wish to heaven I had! What subject is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have affianced your daughter to Sir George Versatile.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph!—Yes; and no. I have; and I have not. I cannot determine. Sir George is a prudent man, his estate is large, and the Ver∣satiles are an ancient race. But your family is ancient, you are prudent, and the wealth left by your uncle is at least equal. What can I say? What can I do? I don't know which to take nor which to refuse. I am everlastingly in these diffi∣culties. I am harassed night and day by them: they are the night mare, they sit upon my bosom, oppress me, suffocate me. I cannot act. I can∣not move.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, my lord, may be an apology to your∣self, but the consequence to me is misery. Your daughter lived in my heart: with her I had pro∣mised
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
myself ages of happiness; and had cherished a passion, impatient perhaps, but, ardent and pure as her own thoughts. This passion your conduct authorized. My fortune, my life, my soul, were devoted to her. Mine was no light or wanton dalliance; nor did I expect a light and wanton conduct from the noble family of which your lordship is the head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, Mr. Delaval? I told you I was undecided; and so I am still. My lady, you know, was never much your friend. Sir George is her favourite.</P>

<P>And is Lady Jane equally changeable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know. She is <HI>my</HI> daughter; and, judging by myself, I should suppose she is perplexed, and doubtful. She never, I believe, declared in your favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not expressly, my lord. She referred me to time and you. 'Tis true I flattered myself her affections were wholly mine. Should she pre∣fer Sir George, or any other man, be my feelings what they will, I then am silenced. My heart could not be satisfied with cold compliance. Oh no! 'Tis of a different stamp. I am told she is not at home. I hope however she will not have the cruelty to deny me a last interview: till when I take my leave. Only suffer me to remark that, had you discovered in me any secret vice, any de∣fects dangerous to the happiness of the woman I adore, you then were justified in your present con∣duct.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY J.</SPEAKER>
<P>His character is too pliant. If others are merry, so is he: if they are sad, he is the same. Their joys and sorrows play upon his countenance: but, though they may slightly graze, they do not penetrate his heart. Even while he relieves, he scarcely feels them.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! Upon my honor, you are a whimsical young lady! Afraid of marrying

</SP>

<P>Then you think me a fool for being wretched at my wife's thoughtlessness, caprice, and impertinence?</P>

<P>Why you know my master last night made enquiries how to find the chambers of Counsellor Demur: so, when he went out this morning, I observed your directions and followed him.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>About six years ago, a certain youth came up from college; poor, and unprotected. He was a scholar, pleasing in manner, warm and ge∣nerous of temper, of a respectable family, and seemed to possess the germ of every virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me on: my praises will not be te∣dious. Chance made him known to a man who desired to cherish his good qualities; and the purse, the experience, and the power of his bene∣factor, such as they were, he profited by to the utmost. Received as a son, he soon became dear to the family: but most dear to the daughter of his friend; whose tender age and glowing affections made her apt to admire the virtues she heard her father so ardently praise, and encourage. You are uneasy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be pleased to continue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The assiduities of the youth to gain her
<PB N="83" REF="83"/>
heart were unabating; and his pretensions, poor and unknown as he then was, were not rejected. The noble nature of his friend scorned to make his poverty his crime. Why do you bite your lip? Was it not generous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Firmly)</STAGE> Was it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly! Nothing could—equal the—generosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The health of his benefactor was declining fast; and the only thing required of the youth was that he should qualify himself for the cares of life, by some profession. He therefore entered a student in the Temple; and the means were fur∣nished by his protector, till the end was obtained. Was not this friendship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The lady, almost a child when first he knew her, increased in grace and beauty faster than in years. Sweetness and smiles played upon her countenance. She was the delight of her friends, the admiration of the world, and the coveted of every eye. Lovers of fortune and fashion con∣tended for her hand: but she had bestowed her heart—had bestowed it on a—Sit still, sir; I shall soon have done. I am coming to the point. Five years elapsed; during which the youth re∣ceived every kindness friendship could afford, and every proof chaste affection had to give. These he returned with promises and protestations that seemed too vast for his heart. I would say for his tongue—Are you unwell, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on with your tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>His benefactor, feeling the hand of death steal on, was anxious to see the two persons dearest
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
to his heart happy before he expired; and the marriage was determined on, the day fixed, and the friends of the family invited. The intended bridegroom appeared half frantic with his ap∣proaching bliss. Now, sir, mark his proceeding. In this short interval, by sudden and unexpected deaths, he becomes the heir to a title and large estate. Well! Does he not fly to the arms of his languishing friend? Does he not pour his new treasures and his transports into the lap of love? Coward and monster!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Both starting up)</STAGE> Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Viler than words can paint! Having robbed a family of honor, a friend of peace, and an angel of every human solace, he fled, like a thief, and concealed himself from immediate con∣tempt and vengeance in a foreign country. But contempt and vengeance have at length overtaken him: they beset him: they face him at this instant. The friend he wronged is dead: but the son of that friend lives, and I am he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis as I thought!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are—I will not defile my lips by telling you what you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own that what I have done—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forbear to interrupt me, sir. You have nothing to plead, and much to hear. First say, did my sister, by any improper conduct, levity of behaviour, or fault or vice whatever, give you just cause to abandon her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>None! None! Her purity is only ex∣ceeded by her love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then how, barbarian, how had you the heart to disgrace the family and endanger the life of a woman whose sanctified affection would have
<PB N="85" REF="85"/>
embraced you in poverty, pestilence, or death; and who, had she possessed empires, would have bestowed them with an imperial affection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you ask, Have I committed er∣rors? call them crimes if you will, Yes. If you demand, Will I justify them? No. If you re∣quire me to atone for them, here is my heart: you have wrongs to revenge, strike; and, if you can, inflict a pang greater than any it yet has known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Justice is not to be disarmed by being braved. To the question. It can be no part of your intention, and certainly not of mine, that you should marry my sister. Something very dif∣ferent must be done.</P>

<P>What? Name it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must give me an acknowledgment, written and signed by yourself, that you have basely and most dishonorably injured, insulted and betrayed Maria Delaval: and this paper, imme∣diately as I leave your house, I shall publish in every possible way; till my sister shall be so ap∣peased, and honor so satiated, that vengeance itself shall cry, Hold!</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Written by me! Published! No. I will sign no such paper.</P>

<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I supposed; and the alternative fol∣lows. Here I am: nor will I quit you, go where you will, till you shall consent to retire with me to some place from which one of us must never re∣turn. Should I be the victor, flight, banishment from my native country, and the bitterest recollec∣tions of the villanies of man, must be the fate of me and my sister. If I fall, you then may tri∣umph and she languish and die unrevenged. This,

<P>What can I answer? The paper you shall not have. My life you are welcome to: take it.</P>

<P>Can you in the spirit even of an enemy ask it? Do you not already despise me enough? Think for a moment: am I the only man that ever erred? Is it so wonderful that a giddy youth, whose habitual failing was compliance, by sudden accident elevated to the pinnacle of fortune, sur∣rounded by proud and selfish relations of whose approbation I was vain, is it so strange that I should be overpowered by their dictates, and yield to their intreaties? Your friendship or my death is now the only alternative. Suppose the latter: will it honor you among men? At the man of blood the heart of man revolts! Will it endear you to

<P>Who is coming?</P>

<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Delaval, Lady Jane, Miss Delaval, and Sir George. There has been sad work! But it is all over, and they are now so happy! Here they are!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>SCENE THE LAST. <HI>Enter Mr.</HI> DELAVAL <HI>lead∣ing</HI> LADY JANE, <HI>and</HI> SIR GEORGE <HI>with</HI> MARIA, <HI>followed by</HI> LUCY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Delaval, I have great obligations to you. Thompson has been telling me of your disinterested equity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The obligation, my lord, was mine. Your lordship well knows that the first of obligations is to be just.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; but the estate you are so willing to resign will still, I hope, be yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dubious as all things are, that is a sub∣ject on which I protest I do not believe I shall ever have any doubts. What say you, Lady Jane? <STAGE>(Irony)</STAGE> But now I have my doubts again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY J.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Eagerly)</STAGE> What doubts, my lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt whether you understand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would your lordship teach me to dis∣semble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD V.</SPEAKER>
<P>Um—I doubt whether that would be much for your good.</P>

<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope Lady Vibrate will not oppose our union?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY V.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mr. Delaval. Your last generous action has charmed me; and Sir George—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has declined in your good opinion. But you cannot think so ill of me as I do of myself; and, if ever again I should recover my own self respect, I shall be indebted for it to this best of men, and to this most incomparable and affection∣ate of women!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>My present joys are inexpressible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which my impetuous indignation threa∣tened▪ for ever to destroy. <STAGE>(Comes forward)</STAGE> How dangerous are extremes! Sometimes we doubt, and indecision is our bane: at others, hurried away by the sudden impulse of passion, our course is marked with misery. One man is too com∣pliant: another too intractable. Yet happiness is the aim of all. Since then all are so liable to be misled, let gentle forbearance, indulgent thoughts, and a mild forgiving spirit, be ever held as the sacred duties of man to man.</P>

<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MR. QUICK, AND MRS. MATTOCKS.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>(As Mr Pope concludes and is preparing to low to the audience, Mr Quick with some importance comes forward.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Q.</SPEAKER>
<L>HOLD, Mr. Pope! Please to give place to me:</L>
<L>'Tis my part to conclude the comedy.</L>
<L>Hem! Hem! <STAGE>(Begins a grave and stately how.)</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<L><STAGE>(Eagerly advancing.)</STAGE> Yours, Mr. Quick? I beg you'll hold your tongue!</L>
<L>All Epilogues of right to me belong.</L>
<L>You tease the audience, sir; and put me out.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Q.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tease? Humph! Permit me, madam, there to doubt.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your part is over, now; your <HI>doubts</HI> are ended.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Q.</SPEAKER>
<L>Would that they were! <STAGE>(To the audience.)</STAGE> Say, friends, are you offended?</L>
<L>Or are you pleas'd? Which way do you incline?</L>
<L>The author has his doubts; and I have mine;</L>
<L>Pronounce our doom: relieve us from our pain!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<L><STAGE>(Laughs.)</STAGE> Look at those dismal features and refrain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Q.</SPEAKER>
<L>Should it be fatal, hear, oh hear, our pleadings!</L>
<L>Grant an arrest of judgment: stay proceedings:</L>
<L>I move the court—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<L>You move? Stand back! I'll wait no longer.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Q.</SPEAKER>
<L>What do you laugh at?</L>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<L>The hypocrite! Well, well, I'm glad he's gone:</L>
<L>For now the <HI>pleadings</HI> will be all my own.</L>
<L>The author hopes I'll advocate his play.</L>
<L>Heaven help the man! What would he have me say?</L>
<STAGE>(Recollecting.)</STAGE>
<L>Something about the anxious months he spent,</L>
<STAGE>(Pompously.)</STAGE>
<L>His garret traversing his brain intent</L>
<L>On this, and that, and t'other; action, plot,</L>
<L>Wit, humour, passion; and the lord knows what!</L>
<L>And tell how difficult it was to write</L>
<L>The charming nonsense you have heard to-night!—</L>
<L>Poor fool! When he suppos'd his work complete,</L>
<L>He thought he had achiev'd a mighty feat!</L>
<L>Nay he protests that earth and heaven he'd move,</L>
<L>Could he but pen what you might well approve.</L>
<L>The man speaks fair; is tolerably civil:</L>
<L>Then, since an author's only a poor devil,</L>
<L>Doom him to what will give us all delight:</L>
<L>Make him repeat his follies every night.</L>
