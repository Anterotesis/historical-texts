<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem was written in the course of the last summer. Why it was not offered to the Stage, it is unnecessary to mention. If it could in any degree answer the purpose, for which it was originally de∣signed, it would not be, as perhaps now is the case, a mere trifle offered to the Public. The Author is conscious that his powers are neither equal to the subject, nor to the zeal with which he undertook it. Removed though he is from the political world, he could not, in his private retreat, be altogether inattentive to the various events, which in the last seven years have changed the face of Europe, and, under the savage conduct of a Nation of professed Atheists, counteracted the order of Providence in the formation of
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>Civil Society. <HI>Nihil est illi Principi Deo, qui omnem hunc Mundum regit, quod quidem in terris fiat acceptius, quam Concilia Coetus que hominum jure Sociati, quoe</HI> CIVITATES <HI>appellantur</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Somn. Scip. S. iii.</NOTE>. He saw the Monarchy of France overturned by the fury of a Demo∣cratic Faction, who have since reduced their whole Nation to a state of Slavery not to be paralelled in the Records of History. FIVE MEN called the DIRECTORY, have silenced the Legislature of their country; they trans∣ported Seventy of the Members to perish on a foreign shore, and from that time have not suffered their NATIONAL ASSEMBLY to enter into a Debate, or to pass a single Law.</P>
<P>The Usurpers at first covered their ambition with the mask of Patriots struggling for Li∣berty; and, as soon as they found themselves possessed of Power, they destroyed LIBERTY ITSELF. With men of their stamp the prac∣tice has been uniformly the same from the days of Tacitus to the present hour. <HI>Ut Im∣perium evertant,</HI> LIBERTATEM praeferunt; sr Everterint, LIBERTATEM IPSAM aggredi∣untur <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Annal. Lib. xvi. S. 22.</NOTE></P>

When the Revolution began in France, the People of England did not look much deeper than the surface; the love of innova∣tion was for some time thought to be zeal for civil liberty; and by great politicians and eminent orators it was called The FABRIC OF HUMAN WISDOM. That doctrine was spread far and wide, and honest men were deceived by appearances. In the mean time a JACO∣BIN PARTY was formed in various parts of England by CONSTITUTIONAL CLUBS and CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES. Republicans in their hearts they pretended to act with ar∣dour for the Constitution. They talked of the RIGHTS OF MAN, of REFORM OF PAR∣LIAMENT, and UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE, while in secret they wished for nothing so much as to see the horrors of French Anarchy intro∣duced into this kingdom. They knew that in a thunder-storm the dregs of the barrel rise to the top. They had read in the fable, that when the oak and the cedar were felled to the ground, the bramble reigned over the forest. Having nothing to lose, they hoped in a convulsion of the state, that they should find their private advantage. The same views and principles in every age and coun∣try
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>have been the motives of all pernicious citizens. The English JACOBINS, as well as the FRENCH, may find their picture drawn by the masterly pencil of Tacitus. <HI>Falso</HI> LIBERTATIS <HI>nomen obtendi ab üs, qui</HI> PRIVA∣TIM DEGENERES, <HI>in publicum</HI> EXITIOSI, <HI>nihil spei nisi per discordias habeant</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ann. Lib. xi. S. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>While our home-bred Factions were em∣ployed at <HI>Sheffield, Norwich, Manchester, London,</HI> and other places, in laying the seed∣plots of Rebellion, this country was on a sudden involved in a just, a necessary, an UNAVOIDABLE War. Unavoidable it must be called, since the REGICIDES thought fit to be the AGGRESSORS. This point has been warmly controverted, and much ink has been lavished on the subject. The present writer does not mean to enter the lists with any person whatever: he only claims a right to think for himself, and, with all possible brevity, to exhibit the light in which things appeared to him.</P>
<P>It has been said that Great Britain pro∣voked the war by the recall of her Ambassador. But that event took place after the 10th of
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>August, 1792, when the King of France was suspended from all the functions of his office, and sent, with the Royal Family, a prisoner to the Temple. The credentials of the Ambas∣sador were then no longer valid. With whom was he to transact business? Was it to be matter of indifference, whether he negotiated with the King, to whom he was sent, or with the BRISSOTS, the MARATS, the ROBE∣SPIERES, and the rest of that Pandaemonium? Would such a conduct have been suited to the honour of the British Nation? It would have been nothing short of a decided part in the internal affairs of France. Had LORD GOWER remained at Paris, he would have been in a precarious situation. He had seen the massacre of the 10th of August: Was he to wait for that of the 2d of September, when no less than three thousand men, women, and children, were most barbarously murdered? The French have lately shewn that they can trample on the rights of ambassadors: They confined the ambassador of Portugal in a prison, and might have behaved with equal insolence to LORD GOWER. In such a junc∣ture, his Majesty thought it became his dig∣nity to send letters of recall, declaring, at the
<PB N="x" REF="7"/>same time, that he would not interfere in the internal government of that kingdom. If the French, who are now <HI>affiliating,</HI> that is en∣slaving GENEVA, will enquire for the works of BURLAMAQUI, they will find that the re∣call of an ambassador, or a refusal to receive one, may proceed from various causes, with∣out being deemed a sufficient provocation of war. It should seem that the French them∣selves were of that opinion, since it appears, that M. LE BRUN, at that time Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his answer to the com∣munication made to him by LORD GOWER, expressed his wish, <HI>that a full reciprocity of justice and good-will might subsist between the two countries.</HI></P>
<P>With what sincerity the Republican Anar∣chists acted on that occasion, may be inferred from their Decree of the 19th November, 1792, by which they promised fraternity and support to the People of every country, who wished to overturn their Government. It is almost superfluous to add, that in answer to <HI>Frost</HI> and <HI>Joel Barlow,</HI> the President of the Convention hoped the day was not far distant, <HI>when he should send congratulations to a similar National Convention in England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="8"/>
It is well known, that an inundation of French Jacobins, whom their <HI>o'ercloy'd coun∣try vomited forth</HI> to propagate their detestable principles, infested every part of London: In such a period the ALIEN BILL was a wife and necessary measure: and it may now well be a question, whether it ought not to be declared perpetual. Whenever a Peace shall be con∣cluded, a banditti of Frenchmen, under the pretext of trade and commerce, will be sent over to wage a war of principles against the Government.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year 1792, the demagogues of Paris were resolved on two grand objects, namely, the murder of their King, and a war with Great Britain. The former was executed on the 21st of January 1793; on the 24th of the same month M. Chauvelin received orders to depart. Though it was well known, that long before that time he had renounced his King, who had sent him hither, and sworn fidelity to his new masters; and though his machinations in this country were well known, he was, notwithstanding, suffered to remain as long as Lewis XVI. was permitted to live. His
<PB N="xii" REF="9"/>credentials expired with his martyred Sove∣reign. His character of ambassador was ter∣minated by the fatal murder of his most Christian Majesty. To have received him with new credentials from the regicides, would have been incompatible with the moral dignity of the British Nation.</P>
<P>The rulers of Paris, having destroyed their, King, proceeded to their long-projected war against Great Britain. In their debate on that subject, on the 1st of February 1793, it was asserted by one of their orators, <HI>That the watchful conduct of the British Ministers, their fears, and jealousies afforded proofs</HI> of the <HI>progress of the opinions and principles of the French Revolution</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See Debrett's Collection of Addresses from English Clubs, published in the year 1793.</NOTE> Is not that avowal from the mouth of an enemy, a full justification of the ALIEN BILL? It was further asserted by <HI>Brissot,</HI> that the British Ministers, for the sake of the trade and commerce of England, ob∣served a STRICT NEUTRALITY. If corrobo∣rating proof of this pacific disposition were ne∣cessary, we have the authority of the MARQUIS DE BOUILLE. That great Officer, known and
<PB N="xiii" REF="10"/>respected throughout Europe, informs us, that he attended the King of Prussia and the Emperor Leopold at Pilnitz, on the 22d of August, 1791, when these two powers formed a Treaty of Alliance; and in the month of September following, he was received in the Cabinet at Vienna, and there the Emperor told him, that he had been waiting for an∣swers from the Courts of <HI>Russia, Spain, Eng∣land,</HI> and the principal Sovereigns of Italy, and had at length received them, and was <HI>assured of the assistance and co-operation of all those powers,</HI> EXCEPT ENGLAND, which had expressed its determination to OBSERVE A STRICT NEUTRALITY <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See the Marquis de Bouille's Memoirs of the French Revolution, page 422.</NOTE></P>
<P>What, in the mean time, was the real dis∣position of the French towards Great Bri∣tain? Mr. HARPER, one of the Representa∣tives in the American Congress, has laid open the intrigues, the stratagems, and over-bear∣ing insolence of the French, from the very beginning of the Revolution. He tells us in express terms, that their grand object was to destroy the trade of Great Britain. <Q><HI>And
<PB N="xiv" REF="11"/>this was to be effected by setting fire to the four corners of Europe, and exciting the People in every quarter to insurrection against their Go∣vernment. A project so atrocious in its end, and so abominable in its means, has never been conceived before. And while all this was going on, the Convention, in order to hood∣wink England, was making to her the most solemn assurances of pacific intentions. It even carried its dissimulation to the almost incredi∣ble length of requesting the mediation of Eng∣land to bring about a Peace with Prussia and the Emperor. In the mean time, their in∣structions to</HI> GENET, <HI>(their Envoy to Ame∣rica) shewed, that it was their manifest ob∣ject to draw the United States into a war with Great Britain. Those instructions were dated January 3d, 1793. Supplementary instruc∣tions were delivered by the same person, Ja∣nuary 17th, 1793. Louis XVI. was guillo∣tined January 21st, 1793; Chauvelin was ordered to quit England, January 24th, 1793, and war was declared against England on the 1st of February following. If the dismissal of Chauvelin was the occasion of the war, as France alledged, why those instructions on the 3d of January so long before the dismissal?
<PB N="xv" REF="12"/>The Leaders of Opposition in England have long persisted in the error of regarding only the</HI> DECLARATIONS <HI>of France, and wholly over∣looking her</HI> ACTIONS <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See Harper's Pamphlet, Page 94, 95.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>If the war was at first unavoidable, it is now just and necessary, as appears from the behaviour of the Directory to LORD MAL∣MESBURY. That Nobleman, invested with the character of Plenipotentiary, offered in the very outset of the negotiation at <HI>Lisle,</HI> the terms of Peace drawn up in the form of a Treaty, which the enemy, had they been in earnest, might have embraced with little or no delay; but, contrary to all precedent, they recalled at the end of near three months, the Plenipotentiaries, who possessed the thread of the whole negotiation, and sent two new Agents to <HI>Lisle,</HI> with a settled design, in the most abrupt manner, to end all further Treaty. Those new Agents by a note, dated the 16th of September, desired to know whe∣ther Lord Malmesbury had powers to give up to France and her Allies, all places con∣quered by Great Britain. They were told by his Lordship, that a decisive answer in the
<PB N="xvi" REF="13"/>negative had been given on the 24th of July preceding. This was of no weight. A Peer of Great Britain, and a Plenipotentiary Am∣bassador, was ordered in the most insolent manner to go and return, that is to fetch and carry for an insolent Directory, who have emerged from obscurity, to be the ty∣rants of their country. This demand of a general restitution is the more extravagant, because after the three great and glorious vic∣tories, unparalleled in the British Annals, by LORD HOWE over the French, by LORD ST. VINCENT over the Spaniards, and lastly, by LORD DUNCAN over the Dutch, it is not in their power to retake any one place that has been conquered from them. Rafts and gun∣boats will not be able to cope with the British Navy.</P>
<P>It has been asked in the House of Com∣mons, <HI>"Are we to persist in the war for the possession of the Cape of</HI> GOOD HOPE, <HI>the Island of</HI> CEYLON, <HI>and Trincomale?"</HI> The following Extract from the Marquis de Bouille's Me∣moirs, will be a sufficient answer to the ques∣tion. "In the summer of 1784," says that great General, <Q>when I was preparing to set out from BERLIN to RUSSIA, I received an
<PB N="xvii" REF="14"/>order from Government to return to Paris. On my arrival there, the Minister ac∣quainted me with a project relative to the East Indies. The object was, to unite the French and Dutch forces in an attack upon the English possessions, to restore to the Princes of the Country the Provinces conquered from them by the English, and to obtain and secure for the two nations Factories and Commercial Establishments, which were to be free to the whole world. The means employed to secure success to this enterprize, were an army of 18,000 men, independent of the garrisons already in that country; twenty millions of livres in specie, and a Naval force able to op∣pose that of the English in the East Indies. TRINCOMALE, in the Island of CEYLON, was the place destined for the rendezvous of the troops, and the repository of the military magazines. One third of the forces, as well as of the sums necessary, and the stores and provisions of every kind were to be furnished by the Dutch, who requested that I should have the command of the expedition. In 1787, the Revolu∣tion broke out in Holland; but was sup∣pressed
<PB N="xviii" REF="15"/>pressed by the entry of a Prussian army under the command of the DUKE OF BRUNSWICK. All the bonds which united FRANCE and HOLLAND were dissolved, the former basely abandoning her Ally, and thus the vast project of the conquest of the Indies vanished into air <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">The Marquis de Bouille's Memoirs, Page 41.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is to be observed, that the above project was in 1784, not more than a year after a General Peace, when nothing had occurred that could give umbrage to France. The same rooted aversion to this country 'still subsists, and is openly avowed by the Direc∣tory: and, after this statement, is TRINCO∣MALE an object of importance to this coun∣try? Shall it be given up to be the rendez∣vous of the enemy's troops, and the reposi∣tory of their magazines? To do it, were to be <HI>felo de se.</HI></P>
<P>Ever since the return of Lord Malmesbury, the Directory have waged a war of Billins∣gate against this country. With scurrility, calumny, and the grossest falsehoods, they have attempted to traduce and vilify a great nation, celebrated throughout Europe for its
<PB N="xix" REF="16"/>humanity no less than its valour. They have declared that the English are a generous people labouring under a bad government, and they are determined to give them on the the Royal Exchange a better constitution. Infatuated men! They had in the begin∣ning of their Revolution the British Consti∣tution as a model to imitate, but they pre∣ferred Anarchy. As Montesquieu expresses it, they had BYZANTIUM before their eyes, and they built CHALCEDON. They have <HI>af∣filiated</HI> HOLLAND, BELGIUM, the States of Italy, and GENEVA, and they have robbed and plundered them all. It now remains for them to destroy the Commerce of Great Britain, and to erect their TRI-COLOURED FLAG on the Royal Exchange. For this pur∣pose they have solicited subscriptions in their own exhausted country, but by that measure they rouzed the spirit of the British Nation. All degrees and ranks of men have conspired with emulation to strengthen the hands of Government, and from the Contributions paid in at the Bank, three things are mani∣fest: First, that the people are united, with one mind, one heart, one hand, against the
<PB N="xx" REF="17"/>attempts of a French banditti: Secondly, that this is an opulent country, ready and willing to strengthen the hands of Govern∣ment: And thirdly, the Voluntary Subscrip∣tions shew, that all ranks and orders of men repose entire confidence in his Majesty's Councils, and his present Ministers. The consequence of this unanimity and firmness, it is hoped, will be the support of the exten∣sive commerce of this country, and the em∣pire of the sea.</P>

<P>The situation, it must be granted, forms an awful period, and requires collected vi∣gour, nothing less than the whole force of the community. And yet, at the same time, we still hear a clamour for RADICAL RE∣FORM. That men of eminence in the state should at length join in such a cry is not a little surprizing. It may, therefore, not be improper to remind them, that on the trial of HARDY at the Old Baily, a letter to him
<PB N="xxi" REF="18"/>from the Society at <HI>Norwich</HI> was produced, containing the following passage: <Q><HI>Whether it is the private design of the several Societies to rip</HI> UP MONARCHY BY THE ROOTS, <HI>and place</HI> DEMOCRACY <HI>in its stead?</HI></Q> What was the answer? <Q><HI>The Committee offer you every assistance in their power, but request that your questions for the future may relate chiefly to</HI> REFORM OF PARLIAMENT.</Q> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Hardy's Trial, by Gurney, Vol. I. Page 223, 225</NOTE> This the Corresponding Society avow as their ostensible object, but conceal their intention with regard to Monarchy. When men of rank and ability allow themselves, after all their efforts, to adopt the same clamour, they run the risk of being thought to follow HARDY'S advice. Whose advice they follow. when their voice is raised against every mea∣sure of Government, it is impossible to say. The suspension of the HABEAS CORPUS ACT is called a violent step, nothing less than a violation of the Constitution, an encroach∣ment on the liberty of the subject, and, in short, a manifest prelude to the reign of terror. The reason assigned for this intem∣perate language is, that no proof of exist∣ing
<PB N="xxii" REF="19"/>plots against the State has been produced in Parliament. But that the Jacobins at <HI>Manchester,</HI> and other places, have been en∣gaged in a conspiracy against this country is evident beyond the possibility of a doubt. And surely, the power of providing for the safety of a whole people is inherent in the frame and spirit of the Constitution. Let us hear what a WHIG of the OLD SCHOOL has said upon the subject. <Q><HI>It is an absur∣dity to imagine that those, who have the au∣thority of making laws, cannot suspend any particular law, when they think it expedient for the public. When, therefore, any law does not conduce to this great end, the very observation of it would endanger the commu∣nity, and that law ought to be laid asleep for a limited time by proper authority. Every government must in its nature be armed with such a power. There cannot be a greater in∣stance of this, than in the old Commonwealth of Rome, who flattered themselves with an opinion, that their government had in it a due temper of the Regal, Noble, and Popular Power, represented by the Consuls, the Sena∣tors, and the Tribunes. Nevertheless, in this government, when the Republic was threatened
<PB N="xxiii" REF="20"/>with danger, they thought fit for the common safety to appoint a Temporary Dictator, in∣vested with the whole power of the Three Branches; who when the danger was over, retired again into the community, and left the government, in its natural situation. The</HI> HABEAS CORPUS ACT <HI>was passed towards the end of</HI> Charles II.; <HI>and since that time has been suspended, twice under the reign of</HI> William and Mary, <HI>once under King</HI> William, <HI>and once in the reign of Queen</HI> Anne; <HI>and again in the year</HI> 1715 <HI>And besides, every unprejudiced man will consider how mildly and equitably this power has been used. The persons confined have been treated with all possible humanity, and abridged of nothing but the liberty of ruining themselves and their families.</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See the Freeholder, No. 17.</NOTE></Q> What Mr. ADDI∣SON has said of the Ministers of GEORGE I. may be applied to the Councils of his pre∣sent Majesty, when the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act</HI> was suspended four years ago. The whole body of the people have equal confidence on the present occasion. But after all, ADDI∣SON, it may be said, was a party writer.
<PB N="xxiv" REF="21"/>MONTESQUIEU was neither WHIG nor TORY. His words are: <Q><HI>Si la puissance legislative se croyoit en danger par quelque Conjuration Secrette contre L'Etat, ou quelque Intelli∣gence avec les Enemis du dehors, Elle pourroit, pour un tems court et limité, per∣mettre à a puisance Exécutrice de faire arrèter les Citoyens suspects, qui ne per∣droient Leur Libertè pour un tems, que pour la conserver pour toujours</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">L'Esprit des Loix, Lib. xi. Cap. vi.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The clamour of a few against the present suspension of the law is not the only mis∣chief of the times. A MONSTER IN POLI∣TICS has lately stalked forth as formidable as that described by LUCRETIUS,</P>
<P><HI>Horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans:</HI></P>
<P>This Phantom is, <Q>The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE;</Q> a FOURTH ESTATE set up in a country, that has been for ages governed by the Legislative Autho∣rity of THREE. If there is such a new order, it is of course paramount to KING, LORDS, and COMMONS, and, by consequence,
<PB N="xxv" REF="22"/>there is an end of our boasted Constitution. But where has this <Q>SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE</Q> ever existed? At ATHENS the people had a share in the go∣vernment, and the citizens of Rome, by their TRIBUNES, assumed and exercised enor∣mous influence; but they had no SOVE∣REIGN MAJESTY. In process of time they both wrought their own ruin. The subjects of Great Britain are much wiser; they dele∣gate their whole authority to their Repre∣sentatives, and beyond that power they claim no authority. If <Q>The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE</Q> ever existed in any part of the known world, it must have been in a pure, unmixed, and persect DEMOCRACY. And where can such a go∣vernment be traced? Polybius says, <Q>Rust is the inbred bane of iron, and worms of wood; and as those substances at last fall a prey to the evils that are congenial to their nature, in the <HI>same manner every</HI> SINGLE KIND OF GOVERNMENT <HI>breeds within itself some certain vice, which soon causes its destruction. Thus,</HI> ROYALTY <HI>de∣generates into Tyranny;</HI> ARISTOCRACY <HI>into Oligarchy; and</HI> DEMOCRACY <HI>into Savage
<PB N="xxvi" REF="23"/>Violence</HI> <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See Polybius, Book vi. Chap, i.</NOTE>.</Q> Such is the natural progress of the simple forms of government. A mixed limited Monarchy has, in its well tempered contexture, the means within itself of checking every mischief: and till a wild Democracy has overturned all whole∣some laws, <Q>The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE</Q> is gigantic nonsense, <Q><HI>full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</HI></Q>.</P>
<P>The REFORM projected by the JACOBINS of this country, would, beyond all doubt, <HI>rip up the Constitution by the roots.</HI> At such a time, the Author of the following Scenes thought, if he could recall the minds of men to the origin and antiquity of the Constitution, under which the people have enjoyed their rights, their property, and their liberty for above five hundred years, his labours might have some tendency to stop the progress of the new philosophy, and check the spirit of innovation. Our form of government, as Motesquieu has truly observed, came to this country from the woods of Germany <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">L'Esprit des Loix, Book</NOTE>. GAUL was reduced to a state of slavery, while Germany displayed a spirit of inde∣pendance.
<PB N="xxvii" REF="24"/>Arminius was the Great Hero of Germany. TACITUS tells us, That <Q>he fought with alternate vicissitudes of fortune: a man of warlike genius; and, beyond all question, the deliverer of Ger∣many. He had not, like the Kings and Generals of a former day, the infancy of Rome to cope with; he had to struggle with a great and flourishing Empire: he attacked the Romans in the meridian of their glory; he stood at bay for a number of years with equivocal success, sometimes victorious, often defeated, but in the issue of the war, STILL UNCONQUERED. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Annal. Lib. II. S. 88.</NOTE></Q> It was from that northern hive that our Saxon ancestors brought with them the same spirit of liberty, and a plan of civil government. They had experienced in their own country the disadvantages of the general suffrage of the people in a mass; they had occasionally tried the more practicable mode of represen∣tation: <HI>Ut missis Legatis in Commune Consulta∣rent, Libertas an Pax Placeret.</HI> They had recourse to the same expedient in England. The WITTENAGEMOT was accordingly esta∣blished,
<PB N="xxviii" REF="25"/>consisting of the King, the Barons, and the Saxon Freemen. The inferior orders of the people were still in bondage, but the remedy was soon applied. Letters of enfran∣chisement were granted not only to individu∣als, but to the inhabitants of towns and cities, who were admitted by their Represen∣tatives to a voice in the Great Council of the Nation. The consequence was, that the kingly power, the privileges of the nobility and clergy, and the rights of the commons were so happily blended, that "I believe," says Montesquieu, <Q>so happy a form of Go∣vernment never presented itself to the mind of man <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">L'Esprit des Loix. Lib. xi. Cap. vi, viii.</NOTE>.</Q> The Great Council of the Nation, called under the ANGLO SAXON GO∣VERNMENT, the WITTENAGEMOT, in process of time took the name of PARLIAMENT, and from that period has been the <HI>Palladium</HI> of British Liberty; a noble fabric, which our internal enemies would fain demolish by what they call a RADICAL REFORM.</P>
<P>It is, however, to be hoped that a venera∣tion for the antiquity of so glorious a Con∣stitution, and a due sense of the blessings,
<PB N="xxix" REF="26"/>which mankind have enjoyed under it, will animate all true Englishmen against their enemies, whether foreign or domestic.</P>
<P>The Author of Arminius has had the pleasure of working under a great master, and in the Notes annexed to the Tragedy, he has cited the passages which he has imitated, because he knows that the sentiments will come with weight and authority from the great writer of political history. That he has not been able to execute up to his own ideas and wishes, he is too conscious; but for a well-meant endeavour no apology can be required.</P>

<L>Are the great springs of war: but well you know</L>
<L>We have in Inguiomer a gallant chief,</L>
<L>Fam'd for his warlike genius; long distinguish'd</L>
<L>By his heroic ardour; ever active</L>

<SPEAKER>EGBERT.</SPEAKER>
<L>In the field</L>
<L>I grant you, Gothmund, his renown is great.</L>
<L>Arminius scarce out-shines him; But, my friend,</L>
<L>Where now that warlike spirit? Tame, inactive,</L>
<L>We dream away the time, and let that castle</L>
<L>Hold us at bay. You know we might ere now</L>
<L>Have storm'd the works.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOTHMUND.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our numbers are too thin:</L>
<L>To conquer by assault our little army</L>
<L>Was ill prepar'd. To spare the lives of men,</L>
<L>Our General chose to form a close blockade,</L>
<L>And hop'd ere this by famine to reduce</L>
<L>A feeble garrison.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EGBERT.</SPEAKER>
<L>So judg'd our Chief;</L>
<L>For that he plann'd his measures, but we know</L>
<L>Th' envenom'd hate, the more than deadly feud,</L>
<L>That, like a pent-up sire, inflames Segestes,</L>
<L>Ere since Arminius wedded to his daughter.</L>
<L>Veleda is a pris'ner in the castle;</L>
<L>By force her father seiz'd her, dragg'd her with him,</L>
<L>And there detains her, obstinately bent,</L>
<L>Never to let her husband see her more.</L>

<SPEAKER>EGBERT.</SPEAKER>
<L>The whole Gallic race</L>
