<L>FORTH from the closet to the improving stage,</L>
<L>We bring the beauties of poor Yorick's page—</L>
<L>In doing so, we but fulfil his plan</L>
<L>To draw in public view the heart of man;</L>
<L>To make the stage a vehicle of wit,</L>
<L>And every varied humour kindly hit;</L>
<L>To raise your sympathy by gentle force,</L>
<L>And reconcile man to his hobby-horse.</L>
<L>Sterne's hobby-horse was sympathy of mind,</L>
<L>And we, in this night's piece, get up behind;</L>
<L>Retain his jokes, keep pity on the trot,</L>
<L>Leave out digressions, and connect by plot;</L>
<L>Bring Toby's goodness and his antique whim,</L>
<L>The Doctor's foible, and the soul of Trim—</L>
<L>In their odd fancies, we our own perceive,</L>
<L>For on some hobby horse all mankind live:</L>
<L>The politician, whose all-conquering pate,</L>
<L>Is fill'd with nothing but affairs of state;</L>
<L>In one short evening, with his pint of beer,</L>
<L>Scudds o'er the acts of many a distant year;</L>
<L>Tells you how Marlbro' fought—how it had been</L>
<L>If heroes now could emulate Eugene.</L>
<L>With broken pipe describes the bloody field,</L>
<L>Retakes the captured, makes the victor yield;</L>
<L>Regains our honour by post-dated schemes,</L>
<L>And credit lost last age in this redeems! —</L>
<L>Yet modern victors have their hobby too,</L>
<L>In bringing ancient valour to our view.</L>
<L>Eager our, foes to humble, fame to gain,</L>
<L>(By way of hobby-horse) they ride the main.</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>Some strive for bucks and bloods themselves to pass:</L>
<L>Poor men! their hobby's neither horse nor ass;</L>
<L>Heedless they gallop on their mongrel beast,</L>
<L>And heedless fall, when they expect it least.</L>
<L>Some on less dang'rous hobbies whip along,</L>
<L>Fickle in taste, in prejudices strong;</L>
<L>Or dress, or books their every thought engage,</L>
<L>And e'en to some good eating is the rage.</L>
<L>See Gobble clear the plate, and by mere force,</L>
<L>Keeps riding on—e'en in the second course.</L>
<L>Each rides apace, nor fears his horse may stumble—</L>
<L>The very best of riders should be humble—</L>
<L>Since to dismount them all our art defies,</L>
<L>Let them ride gently—there the merit lies</L>
<L>Let them not kick to cause the in weaker fall,</L>
<L><HI>The world, God knows, is wide enough for all!</HI></L>
<L>Our fav'rite hobby is to hit your taste,</L>
<L>When you are pleas'd some hours with us to waste</L>
<L>To night our author every merit stakes,</L>
<L>And this gay ring his place of starting makes.</L>
<L>Former success inspires with hopes to win—</L>
<L>Let not the knowing ones be taken in!</L>
<L>Spur our ambition then in this night's course</L>
<L>And Tristram Shandy make your hobby-horse.</L>

<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, you tell me love has made a a progress in both their bosoms; but say, Trim, how does my brother Toby stand the assaults of the widow Wadman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't please your honor, he has capitula∣ted—the Captain has taken in love, as he has taken in every thing else—he has taken it in like a lamb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Widow Wadman, I assure you, Sir, is as far gone as the Captain—poor gentle∣woman! she has taken in love like a lamb too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then must we pursue our scheme—You must continue, Trim, to keep the Captain's flame alive, and you, Susan, must lay fresh fuel upon
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
the widow's fire; this peace, Trim, will break my poor brother's heart, unless we get employ∣ment for his mind, I have philosophiz'd with him in vain—nothing but love can soothe him—Love, Trim—mark Susannah—Love is a passion derived from heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, your honor, and it replenishes the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is my brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't please your honor, he's gone over to the Inn, to visit poor Lieutenant Lefevre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll go to him—Trim, drink suc∣cess to the Captain.
<STAGE>(gives money)</STAGE>
If the widow gets this brother of mine, she gets an invaluable treasure, he has'nt a heart to hurt a fly—Go, says he, one day to an overgrown one, which he had caught as it buzz'd about his nose, and torment∣ed him cruelly, poor devil, I'll not hurt a hair of thy head. Go, said he, lifting up the sash, the world is wide enough for thee and me.—It was a lesson which might serve governors and parents better than a whole volume on the subject of hu∣manity
<STAGE>Exit Shandy.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My master, his honor the captain, and your master his worship, Mr. Shandy, could not be match'd in a day's march, Susan;—good hearts! when the unfortunate claim assistance, they fling down their money with that spirited jerk of an ho∣nest welcome with which generous souls only are able to fling down money;—For each man's sor∣row they have a tear, for each man's need they have a shilling—may heaven ever bless them both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>La! Mr. Trim, I thought as how you gen∣tlemen of the army never pray'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not half an hour, Susan, since I heard Lieutenant Lefevre, a soldier, and a brave
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
soldier pray devoutly; a soldier, Susan, prays as often of his own accord as a parson; and when he's fighting for his king, and for his country, and for his own life, and for his honor too, he has the most reason to pray to heaven, of any man in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Mr. Trim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when a soldier, my dear girl, has been standing twelve hours in the trenches—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great while to stand indeed, Mr. Trim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Up to his knees in cold water, or engag'd in long and dangerous marches, harrass'd in his rear to-day, harrassing others to-morrow;—de∣tach'd here,
<STAGE>(wheeling to right)</STAGE>
countermanded there
<STAGE>(wheeling to the left)</STAGE>
resting this night per∣haps upon his arms—beat up the next in his shirt —benumb'd in his joints, without straw in his tent to kneel on, he must say his prayers how and when he can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it's my opinion when a soldier gets time to pray, he prays as heartily as any parson of them all, though not with so much fuss and hy∣pocrisy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't say that, Susan; heaven only knows who is hypocrite and who is not; at the great and general review of all, and not till then, it will be seen who have deserted from their duty in this world, and who have stood to their posts, and we shall be advanced accordingly
<STAGE>(standing up∣right.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it will never be enquired whether we were flaunting fine ladies, or humble servant maids.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sweet Susan, nor whether we did our duty in a red coat or a black one.—But to business, Susan, the Captain is certainly smitten,
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
what marks of love have you perceived in the widow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why she nightly reads over her marriage-settlement, and every time she reads, cries for her first husband—a strong sign that she's thinking of a second.—But do you know the marks of love, Mr. Trim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know them, I have felt them, Susannah,
<STAGE>(pressing her hand.)</STAGE>
But say, what dost thou think of love thyself, my girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you what it is through the whole alphabet; parson Yorick taught me. You must give me the letter, Mr. Trim, just as you give the word of command—begin with A.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well;—now mind the word—take care.
<STAGE>(as he gives the word he exercises with his stick, and as she answers, she reckons with the fore-finger of her right hand upon her left hand)</STAGE></P>

it is a whole age.</P>

<P>How learnedly the Corporal preaches.</P>

<P>O Obadiah! O Susannah! it would make a good natur'd man's heart bleed, to con∣sider, how many a brave upright fellow hath been laid low since that time—Trust me, Susan, before that time comes again, many a bright eye will be dim.

What is it but corruption?
<STAGE>(<HI>she takes away her hand.</HI>)</STAGE>
—Out of doors I value not death at all, not this—
<STAGE>(<HI>snapping his fingers.</HI>)</STAGE>
—Let him not take me cowardly, what is he? a pull of a trigger, a push of a bayonet. The best way is to stand up to him, the man who flies, is in ten times more danger, than he who marches up to his jaws. I have look'd him an hundred times in his face.— Death is nothing in the field.</P>

<SPEAKER>Oba.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he's woundedly frightful in the house.</P>

<P>For my part, I think it's most natural to meet him in bed.</P>
</SP>

<P>And could I escape him in bed, by creeping into the worst calf-skin that ever was made into a knapsack, I'd do it there—but that is nature.</P>

<P>There's Captain Shandy fears not death, he fears only what every honest man fears—doing a wrong thing. He's as kind an officer as ever stepp'd before a platoon, and would march up to the muzzle of a cannon, tho' there were a light∣ed match at the touch-hole. He'll take care of Lefevre's son—I'd serve him to the day of my death for love.</P>
</SP>

<P>Patriot! ah Susan! no—poor Patriot's sold! Well, I'll e'en borrow the miller's cart-horse, or walk, for better to walk thro' thick and thin all the days of a man's life, than to ride a poor unshod devil, or a devil with a gall'd back, that must feel pain every inch of the road—But I forgot, master's returned from the inn, and would speak with you, Mr. Trim.</P>

<P>And please your honor, I fear I shall want spirits.</P>

<P>Nay, Trim, never be grave—gravity is an errant scoundrel, and of the most dangerous kind too—because a sly one; more honest, well meaning people are bubbled out of their goods and monies by gravity in a twelve-month, than by poc∣ket picking and shop-lifting in seven years.

<P>Then well may the poor Lieutenant remember it—when you waited on the Lieute∣nant, and made him an offer of my services, did
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
you offer him my purse?—Sickness and travel∣ling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was a poor Lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay—Thou should'st have made him an offer of my purse, because if he stood in need, Trim, thou knowest he had been as welcome to it as myself.</P>

thou had'st not orders, and thou did'st very right, Trim, as a soldier, but very ill as a man.

Then when thou offeredst whatever was in my house, thou should'st have offered him my house too.
<STAGE>(<HI>Trim bows.</HI>)</STAGE>

<P>Trim, thou wer't ever a friend to the distressed—And a true friend, for thou hast as∣sisted them behind their backs—I have left, Trim, my Bowling-green brother—I have left him a pension! he always obeyed orders, whether from his officer or from Heaven.</P>

<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had Count Solmes done the same at the battle of Steenkirk, Trim, it would have saved thee from having been run over by the dragoons.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sav'd me! your honor, it would have saved five battalions!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trim's right! perfectly right!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Count Solmes should have sent up the foot, not the horse—We would have fired with them muzzle to muzzle for their lives—</P>

<P>The French, brother; had the advantage of a wood; and give them a moment's time to re∣trench themselves, they are a nation will pop, and pop at you for ever—There is no way but to march cooly up to them, receive their fire, and fall upon them—</P>

<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven! how the battle rages! But is not a man's Hobby-horse the tenderest part about him—and why should I hurt a brother's? I'll send the Widow Wadman to him this in∣stant, she must put an end to this brother's mili∣tary frenzy—O Tristram! Tristram!
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>SCENE, <HI>a</HI> HEDGE <HI>across the Stage, with a Gate.—A Centry Box and Garden Chair on one side, on the other the Ruins of a Fortification— a Draw-Bridge, and several Pioneers Instruments on the Stage.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> TRIM <HI>with a Spade.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so our fortifications are destroyed —Well I'll throw the implements into the bar∣row and roll them off the field.
<STAGE>(<HI>sighs</HI>)</STAGE>
No, I'll do it before his honor rises in the morning —He took pleasure in them and to see them removed might give him pain—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SUSAN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>La, Mr. Trim, what dreadful havoc you have made with your fortifications—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here stood the bastion, and here were the ravelins, and there lay the French—and here was the gate of St. Nicholas, where his ho∣nor received his wound.—Thy crying, Susan, hath made thee look charming—thou look'st like the moist eye of an April morn!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do believe you love me, Trim—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and we'll marry, Susan—We'll marry —The peace will make us all marry!— But here comes the Captain, so get behind the draw-bridge, and I will come to thee presently, and tell thee a story I promised—of the King of Bohemia and his seven castles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll wait, for I would not for the world be taken in confusion by the Captain.
<STAGE>(<HI>goes behind the bridge.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> TOBY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, an't please your honour, that the fortifications are almost destroyed, and the bason is upon a level with the mole—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there is no further occasion for our services—But, Trim, the widow has promised to meet me here immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she know any thing of your ho∣nor's being in love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven help her, no more than the child unborn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! your honor, she does—I know women, and have observed the widow's bush-firing from behind the yew hedge.—Well, I'll stand centinel behind the bridge, and give your honor notice if any one approaches
<STAGE>(goes behind the bridge.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> WIDOW WADMAN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, Captain, I am punctual to my appointment—La! you can't think what I have
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
been meditating on—But what is your opinion, Captain Shandy? Are not the cares and anxiety of the marriage state very great?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can have no inclination for chang∣ing your state;—Indeed I can see no reason for a man's marrying—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SLOP.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, madam, you'll see a very good reason written in the law of Moses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>This intrusion, Dr. Slop,
<STAGE>(he retreats, she follows.)</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stop.</SPEAKER>
<P>She wants you to marry her, Captain Shandy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis false
<STAGE>(<HI>Slop retreats, the Widow fol∣lowing, till they throw down the bridge, and dis∣cover Trim and Susan sitting behind it.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>Mercy defend us!</P>

<P>Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Madam Lucretia, have we caught you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, Trim, that bed-cords would never be sufficient to secure the bridge if attack∣ed by cavalry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a Dutch bridge, your honor, and so there was no depending on it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was shewing it to me, he! he! he!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slop.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in the proof of its excellency and
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
strength some how or other the captain's bridge has been broken down, he! he! he!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was all a misfortune-shewing Susan the spot where his honour got his wound, and going too near the edge of the fosse—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You unfortunately slipped in—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And having Susan under the arm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>He dragged me in after him, he! he! he!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>By means of which, Susan fell back∣wards soss against the bridge, and my foot get∣ting into the curvette, I fell forward full against the bridge too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slop.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, pretty madam, how do you intend to repair your reputation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who dare injure her reputation?—She has a soldier to protect her—he who injures the character of a woman is a villain, and a coward in his heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Slop.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be—but I'll make an incision in her character.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Widow, will you marry me?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SHANDY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I wish to marry the widow with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the widow has not the heart to re∣fuse you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour has carried the place by <HI>coup de main.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Shan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art a true daughter of Eve—Well, Toby, thou wilt never lie diagonally in thy bed
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
again!
<STAGE>(<HI>joins their hands</HI>)</STAGE>
and since peace is now established, I hope every unmarried man and single woman will follow the example of you and the widow, and encrease the strength of the nation by raising supplies for the next war.</P>
