<P>You do indeed—but go, run away with your face as fast you can, and tell your master Don Fernando to wheedle his father into a good humour, and bring him here as quick as possible, for that our old Don is at present disposed to treat with him concerning this said marriage of their children.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jaq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Overtures have been made by Don Velasco in behalf of his son Don Fabricio; but in consideration of my mistress's preference of your master, of his fa∣ther's great wealth, and of the still greater pains I have taken to persuade him in favor of Don Fernando, why—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fab.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall carry the day, hey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Perhaps—You know the grudge these two tetchy old fathers bear one another—they are for ever disputing, fonder of their opinions than they are of their children, and your master has no occasion to be told how necessary caution and expedition will be in this business.</P>
</SP>

<P>My dear delicate little dormouse, your voice is sweeter than the nightingale's, and your words more re∣viving than cherry-brandy. This intelligence will be worth a quarter's wages to me at least; but you are a divine little Angel, that's the truth.</P>

<P>Desperately! I though to have mentioned it the last time I saw you, but some how or other the thing escaped my memory—Indeed, one has so many affairs on hand, one cannot think of every thing; I recollected it before I had got a dozen yards from the door, but then it was too late: so I tied a knot in my handkerchief, as you see, to remind me the next time I met you.</P>

<P>Good morning, good morning, Don Salva∣dor. I have lately made some very curious experiments, by which I find the ponderosity of light, or, to speak more philosophically, the levity of light is extreme! All Spain by no means contains a pound.</P>

<P>Plaything, sir! Plaything, Don Salvador!—<HI REND="margQuotes">Let me advise you as a friend, Don Salvador, when∣ever you speak of philosophy, to do it with more re∣spect, lest you should incur reproof from the learned and the wise—Philosophy, Don Salvador, philosophy is a Being of a superior and divine nature; whose head is among the stars, her feet in the bottomless deep, and whose eye penetrates matter, form, and infinite space, even to darkness and nonentity.</HI>—</P>

<P>YES—yes, yes, I deserve it—the punishment is just—I have lost him for ever, and with him, for ever lost my tranquillity. Will Laura never return?—<HI REND="margQuotes">By what strange infaturation am I governed?—To be con∣scious of one's folly!—of one's extreme absurdity, even at the very moment when it is most predomi∣nant!—to feel it strengthen in proportion as one feels its destructive tendency!—Can this be?—Yes, it is, it is!</HI>— <STAGE>(Rings.)</STAGE><STAGE><HI>Enter a</HI> Footman.</STAGE> It not Laura come back yet?</P>

<P>Lord, madam! I have runn'd myself off my legs.</P>

<P>Have you seen Fabricio?</P>

<P>Tell me instantly what he says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Says, madam?—I never heard a man talk so, and look so, in my life. He complains, and laughs, and sighs, and swears, and prays, and weeps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw any poor gentleman in such a tak∣ing. He calls you an angel, and a coquette, and his de∣light, and his torment, and his dear, and his devil; and vows he shall die if you are not his; and swears he'll never see you more.—He rav'd so, I declare he frighted me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, he does not talk of coming?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>He said, madam, he knew very well, you wanted him to come back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure you did not tell him that I sent you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, madam; you know how strictly you charged me not.—And so he swore, he would rather die a thousand times; and yet, madam, I do believe if he had but thought as how you had sent me, he would have come directly; for he ast me, over and over, whether you sent me, or if you wanted to see him; and I vowed, and purtested, I came of my own head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stupid wretch! why did you do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, lord, madam, did not you bid me?—I did slip out a word or two, and then he was going to come all in a hurry, and then I was oblig'd to swear, and declare, that you knew nothing of the matter; and then he began (to utter such dreadful oaths! I declare I was sca∣rified.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Idiot!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, lord, madam, I did not know what to do; I am sure, I would have told him, with all my heart, what a condition you were in, if I dar'st.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Condition!—Oh, pride, pride!—How mean! how abject!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, madam, he said at last, he should go and take a walk on the Prado; and so, madam, I do believe, that was as much as to say, that, if you wanted him, there you might find him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Wanted him!—This is insup∣portable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And so, madam, if I might advise—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, madam, I am certain—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Isa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue I say—My present torments are not to be endured—yes, I deserve every hu∣miliation that can be inflicted on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, to be sure, she is in a strange twittera∣tion—I know she is in fifty minds now—she does not know whether she should go or stay, or be angry of sorry, or humble, or obstinate, or what—I can't say but I do hope he'll bring her proud stomach down. Such strange fancies and fangles, and airs, and flights, and I will, and I won't—but lord, 'tis the way of all these fine ladies. Because they have not one single thing on earth to cross them, they are always racking their brains to torment
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>themselves—But some folks are fortunate, and some folks are misfortunate.</P>
