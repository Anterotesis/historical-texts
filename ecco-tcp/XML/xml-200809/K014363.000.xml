<HEAD>A PLAIN AND SUCCINCT NARRATIVE OF THE DISTURBANCES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For Notes referred to in the Text, by Letters A B C, &amp;c. see the Appendix.</HEAD>
<P>THE late riots and popular tumults which have happened in the Metropolis and its environs, sufficiently at the instant of their ex∣istence, excited the apprehensions of all ranks of people, to awaken curiosity and make a clear and succinct narrative worthy the acceptance of the public. To render the whole affair as intelligi∣ble as possible, it has been judged necessary to trace the alledged cause of discontent, the Act for the relief of the Papists, to its source. The original motion for the bill, which afterwards passed into a law, was made in the House of Commons by Sir George Savile: the object of it was, to repeal an act of the 10th and 11th of William the Third.
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
The esverity of this act may be gathered from the repealing act, an abstract of which is pre∣fixed, and from the following observations of the members who introduced and supported the bill.</P>
<P>Sir George Savile stated, that one of his principle views in proposing this repeal was, to vindicate the honour and assert the principles of the Pro∣testant religion, to which all persecution was, or ought to be totally averse. That this pure reli∣gion ought not to have had an existence, if per∣secution had been lawful. That it ill became us to practice that with which we reproached others. That he did not meddle with the vast body of that penal code, but selected that act on which he found most of the prosecutions had been formed, and which gave the greatest scope to the base views of interested relations and un∣principled informers. The act had not, it is true, been regularly put in execution, but sometimes it had, and he understood that several Papists lived in great terror, and some under actual contribution. He stated the peaceable beha∣viour of this part of his Majesty's subjects, and mentioned the loyal and excellent address they had lately presented to the throne, in which, they not only expressed their obedience to the Government under which they lived, but their attachment to the constitution. As a guard and security however, he proposed, that a suffi∣cient
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
test <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide abstract of the act, page 4.</NOTE>might be formed, by which they should bind themselves to the support of the Civil Government as by law established.</P>
<P>The motion was seconded by Mr. Dunning, who with great ability entered into a legal discus∣sion of the principles, the objects, and the past operations of the bill, which was moved to be repealed. Some of the severities by him com∣plained of were the following,—for Priests or Je∣suits to teach or officiate in the services of their church, were acts of felony in foreigners, and high treason in the natives of this kingdom. The forfeiture of estates to the next Protestant heir, the power given to a son or other nearest relation, to take possession during the life of the proprietor, and the depriving of Papists from acquiring any legal property by purchase, were, he said, exceedingly oppressive, particularly the last clause, which had a far greater latitude than was understood, for it applied to all legal pro∣perty acquired by other means than that of descent. He declaimed upon the horrid nature of that law, <HI>which deprived a Priest of liberty,</HI> only for officiating in the duties of his religion, and begged to remind the House, that even when the proposed repealing act had passed, the Priests would not be at liberty to exercise their functions, but would still, under the restriction of former laws, be liable to a year's imprison∣ment,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
and the punishment of a heavy sine. He observed, that at the instigation of the most abandoned of mankind, common informers, the magisterial and judicial powers, were of necessity bound to enforce all the shameful penalties of the act. Others of these penalties, held out the most powerful temptations for the commission of acts of depravity, at the very thought of which our nature recoils with horror. They seem calculated to loosen all bands of society, to dissolve all civil, moral, and religious obliga∣tions and duties, to poison the sources of do∣mestic felicity, and to annihilate every prin∣ciple of honour. The encouragement given to children, to lay their hands upon the estates of their parents, and the restitution which debars men from the honest acquisition of property, need, he said, in times like these, of philosophi∣cal liberty, only be mentioned to excite the ut∣most indignation of that House. (A)</P>
<P>The motion was received with universal ap∣probation, and a bill was accordingly brought in and passed without a single negative.</P>
<P>The indulgencies granted by this act to the Papists, such as, not only the free exercise of their religion in licensed chapels, equal to the Presbyterians and all other Dissenters and Sec∣taries, but toleration likewise <HI>to e ect schools</HI> for the education of youth in the Romish tenets,
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
greatly alarmed many people, some on religious, and others on political principles. The re∣sistance made to a similar act in favour of the Catholics in Scotland, (B) contributed to spread the alarm, and bills were dispersed, and adver∣tisements inserted in the news-papers, inviting those who wished well to the cause, to unite un∣der the title of the Protestant Association, and Lord George Gordon, who had been so active at the head of the Malcontents in Scotland was chosen president. Little notice was taken of these societies, and the president, whose eccen∣tric and desultory character (C) and speeches in the House of Commons were frequently the sub∣jects of ridicule, tended rather, both in and out of Parliament, to place those objects, which, as it has proved, well deserved the most serious at∣tention, in a ludicrous than a serious point of view. He has the manners and air of a mo∣dern Puritan; his figure is meagre, his hair strait and his dress plain. The stile of the ad∣vertisements published in the name of the Asso∣ciating Committee, but which were signed only by him, have the appearance of private ad∣dresses to the public, and are such as might ra∣ther have been expected from the famous Wil∣liam Prynne, than from a noble Commoner in this philosophic age. The following is one of these advertisements, which at the same time that it affords a specimen of the spirit and stile, in which these invitations were written, will shew
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
by what means the attention of the people was engaged, and their minds were incited to a con∣sideration of the tendency of the repealing act, and which only became serious in the opinion of the liberal, from the encouragement and pro∣tection it gave the Papists in the <HI>erecting of schools.</HI></P>

<P>THIS is to give notice, That in compliance with a petition addressed to the President, the Committee have resolved that there shall be an∣other general meeting of the Protestants before the London petition is presented to the House of Commons.</P>
<P>The Petition will not be presented this week, but will be kept till towards the close of this session of Parliament, to give time for similar petitions from other parts of England, Wales, and Scotland, to be presented before it.</P>
<P>All the true friends of Great Britain, and of civil and religious liberty, are exhorted to unite in support of the Protestant interest before it is too late; for unanimity and firmness in that glorious cause can alone protect us from the <HI>dangerous confederacy of Popish powers.</HI> If we unite, like one man, for the honour of God, and the liberties of the people, we may yet experi∣ence the blessing of Divine Providence on this

Lord George had frequently spoken in terms which seemed intended to intimidate the House of Commons; and, in order to shew that he was more in earnest, and had more power than they believed, he took every method to incite the public attention. A report was circulated that he had asserted he would not present the Petition, unless he was attended by <HI>forty thousand</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Another account says 20,000.</NOTE>of the Associators at the least. Every one who wished well to the cause, was desired to appear with a blue cockade in his hat. The Associators se∣parated themselves into four grand divisions, as requested in the advertisement; the London, the Westminster, the Southwark, and the Scotch; and flags were provided for each.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on Friday, June the 2d, at ten in the forenoon, an immense concourse assembled at the place appointed, some with serious inten∣tions, some with wicked, and others out of cu∣riosity: and, notwithstanding the intense heat, which was, that day, very remarkable, kept pa∣rading the fields with their flags, singing hymns, marshalling themselves in ranks, and waiting for their leader. About eleven o'clock, Lord George arrived among them, and gave directions in what manner he would have them proceed, and about twelve, (that the whole city might be convinced how serious the people were in their demands) one numerous party was ordered to go round over London Bridge, another over Blackfriars,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
and a third to follow him over Westminster. A huge roll of parchment, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or rather several rolls in one.</NOTE>too, almost as much as a man could carry, containing the names of those who had signed the Petition, was borne be∣fore them. They proceeded with great decorum and decency on their route, and the whole body was assembled, about half past two, before both Houses of Parliament, on which occasion they gave a general shout.</P>
<P>But however peaceable and well disposed some of them might be it was very evident, from the habit and appearance of numbers amongst them, that order and regularity were not long to be ex∣pected from such an assembly; on the contrary, they soon began to exercise the most arbitrary and dictatorial power over both Lords and Com∣mons. They obliged almost all the Members to put blue cockades in their hats, and call out, "No Popery!" Some they compelled to take oaths to vote for the repeal of the obnoxious act▪ and others they insulted in the most indecent and violent manner. They took possession of all the avenues from the outer door to the very door of the House of Commons, which they twice at∣tempted to force open. The like attempt was made at the House of Lords; but by the exer∣tion of the door-keepers, and the care of Sir Francis Molyneux, it did not succeed. The Archbishop of York was one of the first they at∣tacked. As soon as his coach was known com∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
down Parliament-street, he was saluted with hisses, groans, and hootings; and when he got out of his carriage, to avoid greater mischief, was obliged to say (which he did in a pitiable and enfeebled voice) "No Popery, no Popery!" The Lord President of the Council, Lord Bathurst, they pushed about in the rudest man∣ner, and kicked violently on the legs. Lord Mansfield had the glasses of his carriage broken, the pannels beat in, and narrowly escaped with life. The Duke of Northumberland was ex∣ceedingly ill treated, and had his pocket picked of his watch. The Bishop of Litchfield had his gown torn. The wheels of the Bishop of Lincoln's carriage were taken off, and his Lord∣ship might be said to escape personal injury al∣most by miracle. (D)</P>
<P>The Lords Townshend and Hillsborough came together: the latter, who was known by the mob, was most grosly insulted, and had not some of them been partial to Lord Townshend, would, in all probability, have been much more so: as it was, they were both much husseled and pushed about, and sent into the House without their bags, and with their hair hanging loose on their shoulders. The coach of Lord Stormont was broken to pieces, and himself in the hands of the mob for near half an hour, during which time they took the most insolent liberties with him, and pelted him with mud: he was rescued
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
at last by a gentleman who harangued the mob, and prevailed on them to desist. Lords Ash∣burnham and Boston were treated not only with most unwarrantable indignity, but with a mer∣ciless and unmanly severity, particularly Lord Boston, who was so long in their power that it was thought necessary by the Peers to go as a body and endeavour, by their presence, to extri∣cate him, but were prevented by the entrance of his Lordship, out of breath and in great dis∣order, with his coat all powdered and his hair disheveled. The front glass of Lord Trentham's vis â vis was broken, and himself insulted and detained a considerable time. Lord Willough by de Broke, Lord St. John, Lord Dudley, and many others, were personally ill treated; and Wellbore Ellis, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was obliged to take refuge in the Guildhall of Westminster, (whither he was pursued) the windows of which were broke, the doors forced, and Justice Addington, with all the constables, expelled▪ Mr. Ellis escaped at the utmost hazard, and after exceedingly severe and rough treatment.</P>
<P>The behaviour of Lord George Gordon was such as might be expected. He came several times to the top of the gallery stairs, whence he harangued the people, and let them know the bad success their Petition was like to meet with. He told them first, that it was proposed to take it into consideration on Tuesday in a Committee
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
of the House, but that he did not like delays, for the Parliament might be prorogued by that time.</P>
<P>He came once more, and said he saw little rea∣son to hope redress from the decisions of Parlia∣ment—that they should meet again—that they ought not to despair, but to put their trust in Providence.</P>
<P>He came a third time, and said, "Gentlemen, the alarm has gone forth for many miles round the city. You have got a very good Prince, who as soon as he shall hear the alarm has seized such a number of men, will no doubt send down private orders to his Ministers to enforce the prayer of your Petition."</P>
<P>When the mob was raging and roaring in the lobby, General Conway sat himself down by Lord George, and addressed him to the following purpose: "My Lord, I am a military man, and I shall think it my duty to protect the freedom of debate in this House by my sword; you see, my Lord, the Members of this House are this day all in arms. Do not imagine that we will be over∣powered or intimidated by a rude, undisciplined, unprincipled rabble. There is only one entry into the House of Commons, and that is a narrow one. Reflect, that men of honour may defend this pass;—and that certainly many lives will be lost
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
before we will suffer ourselves to be overawed by your adherents. I wish, in one word, my Lord, to know whether it is your intention to bring those men, whose wild uproar now strikes our ears, within the walls of this house?" Soon after General Conway had done speaking with Lord George, Colonel Gordon, a near relation of his Lordship's, went up to him, and accosted him in the following manner: "My Lord George, do you intend to bring your rascally adherents into the House of Commons? If you do,—the first man of them that enters, I will plunge my sword not into his, but into your body."</P>
<P>Lord George, it is said, was very much dis∣mayed by what had fallen from General Conway, and his kinsman, Colonel Gordon, and it was in consequence of what they had threatened, that he came to the top of the gallery stairs, and desired the populace to be quiet, and to trust to the goodness of their cause, and to his Ma∣jesty's clemency and justice.</P>
<P>While his Lordship was making his second speech, one of his relations, General Grant, came behind him, and by a gentle violence en∣deavoured to draw him back into the House, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to him, "O Lord George, Lord George! for God's sake, Lord George! do not lead these poor people into any danger."—His Lordship, however, made the General no answer, but con∣tinued
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
his harangue—"You see, said he, in this effort to persuade me from my duty, before your eyes, an instance of the difficulties I have to encounter with from such wise men of this world as my honourable friend behind my back."</P>
<P>Alderman Sawbridge and others endeavoured to persuade the people to clear the lobby, but to no purpose; and about nine o'clock, different Members conjured them in the most earnest and pathetic manner to disperse, informing them at the same time of their danger, and of the reso∣lution that was taken to send for the Guards. The young gentleman, the Assistant to the Chaplain of the House of Commons, addressed them, but gained nothing except curses, and "You be damned! Lord George Gordon for∣ever!" soon after this, a party of Horse and Foot Guards arrived. Justice Addington was at the head of the Horse, and was received with a volley of hisses; but on his assuring the peo∣ple that his disposition towards them was per∣fectly peaceable, and that he would order the soldiers away, if they would give their honour to disperse, he gained their good will. Accord∣ingly the Cavalry galloped off, and upwards of six hundred of the Petitioners, after giving the Magistrate three cheers, departed from thence.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the day the attention of the House of Commons had been taken up in
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
debates concerning the Mob. When they had obtained some degree of order, Lord George in∣troduced his business with informing them, that he had before him a Petition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Note F.</NOTE>signed by near one hundred and twenty thousand of his Majesty's Protestant subjects, praying "A Repeal of the Act passed the last Session in favour of the Ro∣man Catholics," and moved to have the said Pe∣tition brought up.</P>
<P>Mr. Alderman Bull seconded the motion, and leave was accordingly given.</P>
<P>Having brought up the Petition, his Lordship then moved to have it taken into immediate con∣sideration, and was again seconded by Mr. Al∣derman Bull.</P>
<P>After some debate, the House divided, and there appeared six for the Petition, and one hundred and ninety-two against it. Soon after this the House adjourned, and the mob having dispersed from the avenues of both Houses, the Guards were ordered home.</P>
<P>But though order and tranquility were re-estab∣lished in this part of the town, it was far other∣wise elsewhere. The Mob had paraded off in dif∣ferent divisions from Palace Yard, and (whether instigated by religious phrenzy or designing men, time alone can discover) as a prelude to the hor∣rid
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
devastations which were to follow, went some of them to the Romish Chapel in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and others to that in War∣wick-street, Golden-square, both of which they in a great measure demolished. The military were sent for with the utmost expedition to both places, but could not arrive time enough at either to prevent the mischiefs. Those who had the command of the military were very cautious of proceeding to extremities, much scuffling en∣sued, and some few were slightly wounded with the bayonets. Thirteen of the rioters were taken, and the mob, for that night, dispersed without any farther mischief.</P>
<P>The conclusion of this evening's disturbance may be said, to be only the beginning of those dreadful scenes of desolation which have since ensued; and which when the perpetrators are long sunk into oblivion, shall be recorded as some of the most unparalleled and daring out∣rages history can furnish.</P>
<P>The riots which were so alarming on Friday evening partly subsided on the Saturday, and the peaceable part of the inhabitants imagined it was nothing more than the intemperate fury of a few misguided zealots, assisted by those mis∣creants, who always mingle with the mob, whose trade is plunder, and who are therefore continually active in all scenes where tumult and
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
anarchy prevail. But this was by no means the case, for on Sunday in the afternoon, the rioters assembled in large bodies, and attacked the chapels and dwelling-houses of the Catho∣lics in and about Moorfields. They stript their houses of furniture, and their chapels not only of the ornaments and insignia of religi∣on, but tore up the altars, pulpits, pews, and benches, and made huge fires of them, leaving nothing but the bare walls, and in many places not even them. They publicly avowed their intention to root out Popery, to release those who had been confined in Newgate for their pro∣ceedings at the Sardinian and Warwick street chapels on Friday, to pull down the houses of the justices who committed them, and the persons who gave evidence against them like∣wise.</P>
<P>On Monday the mobs collected again, and be∣came more formidable. They began to put their threats in execution in different quarters of the town. Some paraded with the reliques of havock, which they collected in Moorfields, as far as Lord George Gordon's house, in Wel∣beck-street, and afterwards burnt them in the adjacent fields. Another party went to Virginia∣lane, Wapping, and a third to N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghtingale-lane, Fast Smithfield, where they severally destroyed the Catholic Chapels, and committed other outrages. They seemed to have been marshalled
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
out, and different bodies dispatched on these infernal errands. Mr. Rainsforth, tallow-chand∣ler, of Stanhope-street, Clare-market, and Mr. Maberly of Little Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn∣fields, who had appeared as evidences on the examination of those who had been committed, had each of them their houses, shops, &amp;c. stript, or as they wantonly termed it, gutted, and the contents committed to the flames. Sir George Savile's house in Leicester-fields underwent the same fate, his crime was preparing and bring∣ing the bill into Parliament in favour of the Ca∣tholics. Happily for Sir George he had pru∣dently removed his plate and some of the most valuable of his furniture, and other effects, in a private manner.</P>
<P>This day also, which was held as the Anni∣versary of the King's birth-day, a Proclama∣tion was issued, promising a reward of five hun∣dred pounds, to those who would make disco∣very of the person or persons concerned in de∣molishing and setting fire to the Sardinian and Bavarian Chapels. The persons formerly ap∣prehended, too, were re-examined, and some were discharged, while others were ordered to Newgate, whither they were escorted by a party of the Guards, whom, on their return, the mob had the insolence to pelt. One of the soldiers who had been hurt by a stone, turned and pre∣sented his piece; but the commanding officer
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
humanely ordered him not to fire; and the sol∣diers were obliged to make a hasty retreat.</P>
<P>All ranks of people began to be exceedingly terrified at the lawless proceedings of this day; and numbers put blue cockades in their hats, (al∣though it might now be said to be the ensign of rebellion,) on purpose to avoid personal injury and insult.</P>
<P>We now come to that period of desolation and destruction, when every man began to tremble, not only for the safety of the city, but for the constitution, for the kingdom, for property, li∣berty and life, for every thing that is dear to so∣ciety, or to Englishmen.</P>
<P>On Tuesday all the military in town were or∣dered on duty at the Tower, both Houses of Par∣liament, St. James's, St. George's Fields, &amp;c. during the day. Notwithstanding every precau∣tion, Lord Sandwich was wounded in attempt∣ing to go down to the Parliament House to at∣tend his duty, his carriage demolished, and him∣self rescued by the military with difficulty. The house of Lord North was attacked, and only preserved by the exertion of a party of Light Horse, who rode over, and wounded with their swords, several of the assailants.</P>
<P>About six in the evening one party went to the house of Justice Hyde, near Leicester Fields,
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
which they destroyed in less than an hour; ano∣ther, shortly after, paraded through Long Acre, down Holborn, &amp;c. till they came to Newgate, and publicly declared they would go and release the onfined Rioters. When they arrived at the doors of the prison, they demanded of Mr. Aker∣man the keeper, to have their comrades imme∣diately delivered up to them; and upon his per∣sisting to do his duty, by refusing, they began some to break the windows, some to batter the doors and entrances into the cells, with pick-axes and sledge-hammers, others with ladders to climb the vast walls, while others collected fire∣brands, and whatever combustibles they could find, and flung into his dwelling house. What contributed more than any thing to the spreading of the flames, was the great quantity of house∣hold furniture belonging to Mr. Akerman, which they threw out of the windows, piled up against the doors, and set fire to; the force of which presently communicated to the house, from the house to the chapel, and from thence▪ by the assistance of the Mob, all through the prison. A party of Constables, nearly to the amount of a hundred, came to the assistance of the keeper; these the Mob made a lane for, and suffered to pass till they were entirely encircled, when they attacked them with great fury, broke their staffs, and converted them into brands, which they hurled about wherever the fire, which was spreading very fast, had not caught. It is
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
almost incredible to think that it were possible to destroy a building of such amazing strength and extent, with so much swiftness as they accom∣plished this. As soon as the flames had destroy∣ed Mr. Akerman's house, which was part of Newgate, and were communicated to the wards and cells, all the prisoners, to the amount of three hundred, among whom were four under sentence of death, and ordered for execution on the Thursday following, were released. The acti∣vity of the Mob was in this instance, as well as every other, amazing. They dragged out the pri∣soners, many of them, by the hair of the head, by the legs or arms, or whatever part they could lay hold of: They broke open the doors of the different entrances, as easily as if they had all their lives been acquainted with the intricacies of the place, to let the confined escape. Great numbers were let out at the door that leads to the Session's House; and so well planned were all the ma∣noeuvres of these desperate ruffians, that they had placed centinels at the avenues, to prevent any of the prisoners from being conveyed to other jails. Thus was the strongest and most durable prison in England, that had been newly erected, and was not yet finished, and in the building of which the nation had expended im∣mense sums demolished, the bare walls excepted, which were too thick and strong to yield to the force of sire, in the space of a few hours.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>
Even this was but a moiety of the mischief of this terrible night. Not satiated with the destruction of this great building, a party was sent among the Catholics in Devonshire-street, Red Lion-square; another to the house of Justice Cox in Great Queen-street, which was soon de∣stroyed; a third broke open the doors of the New Prison, Clerkenwell, and turned out all the confined; a fourth destroyed the furniture and effects, writings, &amp;c. of Sir John Fielding; and a fifth desperate and infernal gang went to the elegant house of Lord Mansfield, in Blooms∣bury-square, which they, with the most unre∣lenting fury, set fire to and consumed. The loss here was immense, both to Lord Mansfield as an individual, and to the public. A most valuable collection of pictures, some of the scarcest manuscripts said to be in the possession of any private person in the world, with all his Lordship's notes on great law cases, and the con∣stitution of England, were all sacrificed by mad∣men and villains; and Lord and Lady Mans∣field were with difficulty preserved from their rage, by making their escape through a back door, a few minutes before these miscreants broke in and took possession of the house. The military was sent for, but arrived too late; they were obliged, however, to fire in their own de∣fence, and six men and a woman were killed, and several wounded. Not contented with the havock and destruction they had been guilty of
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
in Bloomsbury, they went from thence to his Lordship's country seat at Caen Wood, which would certainly have shared the same fate, had not they been repelled by a party of Horse which had been sent thither for the preservation of this delightful place. The inhabitants were obliged this night to illuminate their windows.</P>
<P>It is impossible to give any adequate description of the events of Wednesday. Notice was sent round to the public prisons of the King's Bench, Fleet, &amp;c. by the Mob, at what time they would come and burn them down. The same kind of infernal humanity was exercised towards Mr. Lang∣dale, a distiller in Holborn, and several other Ro∣mish individuals. Three boys went through the streets, and in particular down Holborn, in the middle of the day, with iron bars, got from the railing before Lord Mansfield's house, extorting money at every shop huzzaing and shouting, "No Popery!" and though numbers were pas∣sing and repassing, the inhabitants durst not re∣fuse them money; nor durst any body attempt to secure them, to have them punished. Small parties of the like daring nature were formed in other parts, and the whole city was laid under contribution. One man in particular was mounted on horseback, and refused to take any thing but gold. Two men in the broad day, not contented with the former mischief, got in∣to Mr. Mabberly's house in Queen-street, and
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
staid for upwards of an hour knocking down the wainscoting, and every bit of wood work they could, with safety to themselves; and though a great many peaceable well dressed people looked on, no one molested them. In the afternoon all the shops were shut, and bits of blue silk, by way of flags, hung out at most houses, with the words, "No Popery," chalked on the doors and window shutters, by way of deprecating the fury of the insurgents, from which no person thought himself secure.</P>
<P>As soon as the day was drawing towards a close, one of the most awful and dreadful spec∣tacles this country ever beheld was exhibited. The mob had not only declared their resolution of firing the prisons, and some private houses, but had avowed their intention to destroy the Bank, Gray's Inn, Temple, Lincoln's Inn, the Grand Arsenal at Woolwich, and Royal Palaces. A universal stupor had seized the minds of men: They looked at one another, and waited with a resigned consternation for the events which were to follow. Government indeed had exerted it∣self to the utmost, as far as their power, under the direction of the civil magistrate, would ex∣tend. Now, however, it was become necessary to make use of the royal prerogative, and give discretionary powers to the military. Nothing could convey a more awful idea of the mischief which was dreaded, than the strong guard which
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
was placed in the Royal Exchange for the pro∣tection of the Bank, as nothing perhaps could have equalled the national desolation, had the diabolical purposes of the insurgents upon this place succeeded. Besides this, soldiers were distributed at Guildhall, in the Inns of Court, in almost every place tenable as a fortification, and in some private houses; and the cannon was disposed to the best advantage in the Park.</P>
<P>With minds thus predisposed to terror by so many objects of devastation, and in a city which but a few days before enjoyed the most perfect tranquility, let those who were not spectators judge what the inhabitants felt when they be∣held at the same instant the flames ascending and rolling in vast and voluminous clouds from the King's Bench and Fleet Prisons, from New Bridewell, from the Toll gates on Blackfriars Bridge, from houses in every quarter of the town, and particularly from the bottom and middle of Holborn, where the conflagration was horrible beyond description. The houses that were first set on fire at this last mentioned place, both belonged to Mr. Langdale, an emi∣nent distiller, and contained immense quantities of spirituous liquors. It is easy to conceive what fury these would add to the flames; but to form an adequate idea of the distress of the neighbouring inhabitants, or indeed of the in∣habitants in every part of the city, is not so easy.
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Men, women, and children were running up and down with beds, glasses, bundles, or whatever they wished most to preserve. In streets where there were no fires, numbers were remov∣ing their goods and effects at midnight. The tremendous roar of the insatiate and innumera∣ble fiends who were the authors of these horrible scenes, was heard at one instant, and at the next the dreadful report of soldiers muskets, as if firing in platoons, and at various places; in short, every thing which could impress the mind with ideas of universal anarchy, and approaching de∣solation, seemed to be accumulating. Sleep and rest were things not thought of; the streets were swarming with people, and uproar, confu∣sion, and terror reigned in every part.</P>
<P>It is hardly possible to collect, in one point of view, the havock of this night; had half the mischief the Mob had threatened been effected, nothing less than national bankruptcy and de∣struction could have ensued: that they were pre∣vented at those places, on the safety of which the very existence of the empire might be said to depend, was owing not to their want of will but power, and to the exertion of Government. They made two attempts upon the Bank; but were so much intimidated by the strength with which they beheld it guarded, that their attacks were but feebly conducted. They were led on to the first by a brewer's servant on horseback, who
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
had decorated his horse with the chains of New∣gate; but were repulsed at the first fire from the Military, and their second succeeded no better. They made an effort to break into the Pay Office likewise, and met the same fate. Several of them fell in these skirmishes, and many more were wounded, as the importance of these places made it necessary to shew but little lenity.</P>
<P>The Regulars and Militia had poured in so fast, in consequence of the expresses dispatched for that purpose, that the citizens on Thursday began to recover from a consternation in which many of them, especially those whose duty it was to have taken the most active part possible, had been disgracefully stupified. They were, however, so thoroughly alarmed, and so much affected by the depredations they beheld on every side, that the shops were universally shut from Tyburn to Whitechapel, and no business of any kind, except at the Bank, was transacted; and here, the run, instead of being greater than ordi∣nary, was near 80,000l. less, a proof that the arrival of the troops had quieted their fears.</P>
<P>It is impossible to ascertain the number of un∣happy and deluded wretches who lost their lives on the last dreadful night; but it is a consola∣tion that very few innocent people, or people of credit, a Banker's Clerk excepted, were among the killed. The escape of one young lad, though
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
perhaps he might not deserve so good a fate, me∣rits, from its singularity, a place in this Narration. While the Fleet Prison was burning, the Mob had the audacity, notwithstanding the presence of the Military, to cut the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pes from, and toss into the flames, a large engine which had been brought to play upon the contiguous buildings. The soldiers were thereupon ordered to disperse them. Among others, there were four people seated upon the roof of the Market-house, who refused to obey the Military, and who were therefore ordered to fire. The discharge of the muskets came from three directions, in the front, and at each side, so that it seemed impossible for any one to escape, and for a considerable time they all four lay dead, as was supposed. At length, however, one of them was observed to raise his head a little, and instantly clap it down and lay still again; he repeated this manoeuvre two or three times, till at last he ventured to slide down, and ran away with great celerity. He was by far the genteelest in appearance of the four. The three were shot dead at the instant, and two were on one side of him, and one on the other. One of the dead was a chimney-sweeper, about sixteen years old, and had forty guineas in his pockets.</P>
<P>The toll-gates at Black friars appear to have been burnt for the sake of the plunder: there were some lives lost there too, and one man who was
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
shot, ran thirty or forty yards before he dropped, as appears by the blood which may be traced in plashes on the pavement.</P>
<P>But powder and ball do not seem to have been so fatal to them as their own inordinate ap∣petites. Numbers, it is said, and at various places, died with inebriation, especially at the distilleries of the unfortunate Mr. Langdale, from whose vessels the liquor ran down the middle of the street, was taken up by pailfuls, and held to the mouths of the besotted multitude; many of whom killed themselves with drinking non-recti∣fied spirits, and were burnt or buried in the ruins. Eight or nine of these miserable wretches have been found and dragged out. (I) The same scenes of beastly drunkenness happened in many other places; at Mr. Cox's, at Lord Mansfield's, where an ill-looking fellow, about nineteen, that was wounded, and had his hair clotted with blood, was too drunk, at one o'clock the next day, to be made sensible; at Newgate likewise many of them had made so free with the liquor that they could not get away, and were burnt in the cells. In the streets men were lying upon bulks and stalls, and at the doors of empty houses, drunk to a state of insensibility, and to a con∣tempt of danger: boys and women were in the same condition, and many of the latter with in∣fants in their arms.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
There were six and thirty (K) fires all blazing at one time, and all to be seen from one spot, made from the furniture of the inhabitants, and the wrecks of their houses in and about the neigh∣bourhood of Queen-street and little Russel-street, Bloomsbury. A person who stood and beheld this scene with horror, said to the Officer who was there with a party of soldiers, that he thought a deal of the mischief might be prevent∣ed, as the perpetrators appeared chiefly to be boys. This discourse was overheard by another person, a well dressed decent-looking man, who damned the speaker's blood and bade him get home to bed.</P>
<P>But tho' centinels were posted at every avenue, and every shop was shut, tho' the whole city had the appearance of a place that every moment ex∣pected to be stormed, and was so well defended that nothing less than a regular army could have endangered it, yet the inhabitants could by no means persuade themselves they were entirely secure. Not only were their doors all scrawled with chalk, intimating that they were no Papists, and their windows decorated with blue flags or ribbands, but the very Jews, in Houndsditch and Duke's Place, were so terri∣fied that they followed the general example, and, unintentionally, gave an air of ridicule to what they understood in a very serious light, by writing
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
on their shutters, "This house is a true Pro∣testant."</P>
<P>The Military were exceedingly active all the day, and secured great numbers of the disorder∣ly; fifty were taken in the Cells of Newgate attempting to rekindle the fire in those few parts, which on account of the vast extent of the building, had not been totally destroyed. It is remarkable that several of the prisoners who had been released by the mob, had so great an affection for those scenes to which they had been long accustomed, that they could not forbear loitering about the Cells, and coming to view them, and were accordingly retaken. Many others were found sauntering near their old haunts in Cloth Fair, Black Boy Alley, Gravel Lane, &amp;c. by the thieftakers, and re-committed by the magis∣trates. Every hour brought intelligence of the ap∣prehending of some of the insurgents, as all suspi∣cious persons were examined, and all hackney∣coaches, stages, and other vehicles, searched. An attack was this day made upon the Marshal∣sea Prison by the Rioters, but they were repelled.</P>
<P>No sooner were the distressed citizens relieved in part from one fear, than they were invaded by another. They beheld, as before related, the Royal Exchange, the Bank, the Inns of Court, every place in the possession of an arm∣ed force. Their lives and property were the
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
moment before at the mercy of a lawless and unprincipled rabble. Their rights, their liber∣ties, the constitution of England, objects of still greater consequence, dearer even than life and property, were now at the disposal of the Court. In such colours, however, did the unusual objects which every where met their eyes paint things to their imaginations▪ They saw soldiers, without the least ceremony, stop whoever they pleased, and no one durst resist: they were sensible of the necessity and propriety of such measures, yet sighed at that necessity, and trembled for their freedom. Those virtuous citizens, who held their country and their laws superior to every thing, who reflected on and rejoiced at the blessings of liberty, and groaned at the appearance only of despotism, had their terrors greatly increased at a report, which every where prevailed, that Martial Law was proclaimed. The following was the occasion of the report.</P>

<P>Convinced as they were that it was unavoid∣able, there was not a word in the latter part of the above Proclamation that did not carry a wound to the heart of every thinking and virtu∣ous Englishman. Martial Law was not, it is true, immediately and rigorously enforced, they did not hang delinquents in the streets without form or process <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though even this was <HI>reported,</HI> a man was said to be hanging upon a lamp iron in Cheapside▪ on Thursday in the afternoon, and six more, the same account added, were to suffer the following morning at Whitehall.</NOTE>, but they <HI>had</HI> discretionary powers to bayonet or shoot. No abuse of these assumed and delegated powers had been exhibit∣ed; but the possibility of abuse, the being but an hour under the controul of a Military Force, was humiliating, derogatory, and alarming. (L)</P>
<P>While an exact state of the fears of all good patriots is related, it is but justice to give Go∣vernment praise for the proper use they made of the power they were thus obliged to usurp. No part of their conduct reflects greater honour on
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
them than the publication of the following hand-bill, if it were done by their direction, which was generally understood. Numerous copies of them were given away on Thursday, and the whole tenor of it sufficiently justifies what has been asserted, and what most assuredly was severely felt, and seriously thought upon, viz. that the Constitution was endangered.</P>
<P>"Whereas some ill-designing and malicious persons have published, for the purpose of dis∣quieting the minds of his Majesty's faithful sub∣jects▪ That it is intended to try the prisoners, now in custody, by martial law; Notice is given, by authority, that no such purpose or intention has ever been in the contemplation of govern∣ment; but that the said prisoners will be tried by the due course of law, as expeditiously as may be."</P>
<P>This account of the public attention to their rights is necessarily a part of the Narrative; and is, besides, due to those who, in times of tumult and disorder like these spoken of, had fortitude and virtue enough not to be so embarrassed as to forget that which constitutes the greatest bessing upon earth. It affords this instructive lesson likewise: that it is the duty of good citizens, who have a real, and not merely a verbal love for their country and freedom, to think seriously of establishing that kind of police which shall
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
enable them to defend themselves, without the aid of powers which may, sometimes, be turned to their destruction.</P>
<P>Another very proper hand-bill was circulated, and which it is probable was done by the Pro∣testant Association. The following is a copy.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>IT is earnestly requested of all peaceable and well-disposed persons, <HI>(as well Protestants associated as others)</HI> that they will abstain from wearing BLUE COCKADES, as these ensigns are now assumed by a set of miscreants, whose purpose it is to burn this city, and plunder its inhabitants; and who wish, by distributing amongst better-disposed persons, and prevailing on them to wear these marks and distinctions, to screen themselves from the detestation and punishment due to their enormous crimes.</P>
<P>And it is farther recommended to all trades∣men and masters of families, not to employ or retain in their service any persons who distinguish themselves by wearing blue cockades.</P></Q>
<P>It is now time to relate another part of the business, which has claimed the attention of some politicians who pretend to see farther into latent causes than the bulk of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45"/>
The mischief which had been perpetrated, and that which was evidently intended, were of so black an aspect, and involved so entirely the destruction of the empire, that the most dispassionate, and those who were least liable to be perverted by idle conjecture, could not help sometimes think∣ing they saw a wicked head directing the violent and rude hands of the mob. The universal de∣struction of the prisons was a vast project; but such a one as was not altogether improbable to be a favourite scheme with a lawless rabble. History furnishes examples of the like. But no history can parallel the depth of their schemes upon the Bank, the Treasury, and the demolition of the water-works, thereby to prevent the ex∣tinguishing any conflagration they had begun; and that these schemes were not the chimeras of fear, were evident. A strong guard was sent to the New River head, and continued there on constant duty. Exclusive of these, the grand Arsenal at Woolwich, the Mansion House, the Inns of Court, and many other places of the greatest national concern, were devoted, and there was scarce a person on the Thursday but was unanimous in supposing the desolation of the city and country was intended. Another hand∣bill, besides those already inserted, was distribut∣ed, which perhaps might take its rise from the general opinion; but which, however, tended to give that opinion strength. It was as follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="45" REF="46"/>

<DIV1 TYPE="handbill">
<HEAD>NO FRENCH RIOTERS.</HEAD>
<P>This is to give notice, that it now appears, that the horrible Riots which have been com∣mitted in this city have been promoted by French money, and to call upon all honest men to stand forth against Rioters, who under the cloak of Religion, are wantonly destroying our property, and endeavouring to overset our hap∣py constitution. If the French are suffered by these means to prevail, Popery will certainly be introduced, which we have no reason to fear from a British Parliament.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Still farther to confirm these conjectures, the Newspapers of Friday gave accounts of louis∣d'ors being found upon some of the Rioters who had been killed or taken; and what at last en∣tirely gave it credit, was the apprehending, ex∣amination, and commitment of Lord GEORGE GORDON. He was conducted to the Tower on Friday evening, under a remarkably strong guard, said to be far the most numerous that ever escorted a State Prisoner. A large party of infantry was in the front. His Lordship follow∣ed in a coach, in which were two officers. Two soldiers rode behind the coach, which was imme∣diately followed by General Carpenter's regiment of dragoons. After this, came a Colonel's guard of the Foot Guards; and a strong party of Militia marched on each side of the carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>
This transaction rung through London, and so entirely was he deemed the original Author, and promoter of the Riots, that few were found to pity him. A thousand surmises were circu∣lated, such as, `whether religion, avarice, or ambition, was the motive that had prompted him in the action, whether France, (M) or any foreign powers had been abettors; and others of the like nature, equally, at present, vague and indeter∣minate. This much however, ought in justice to Lord George to be observed, that it is appa∣rent from what has hitherto transpired, that he has been actuated rather by a wrong head, than a wicked heart. No better account of the whole affair for the present than the following, which is copied from the public prints, can be procured.</P>
<P>The circumstance that first induced the Mem∣bers of Administration to turn their thoughts towards taking the Noble Patron of the Protes∣tant Rioters into custody, is said to be this—Lord George, in the heat of his too successful enthusiasm, wrote a letter, which he sent for in∣sertion to the conductor of a Morning Publica∣tion, addressed to his religious Associates, wherein he recommended them to nourish the noble spi∣rit that had so laudably taken possession of them, and told them that he did not in the smallest de∣gree doubt that an unlimited compliance with all their requisitions would be the undoubted consequence of their perseverance. He at the
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
same time indeed annexed a kind of exhortation for the preservation of peace and good order; but as this concluding suggestion was too repug∣nant to the general tenour of the epistle, and al∣so far too faintly urged to produce an adequate effect, the Printer very judiciously deemed it the best step he could take for the welfare and quiet of his country, to send the Copy of this Letter to Government, which he accordingly did, in a note addressed to Lord Hillsborough. His Lord∣ship, immediately on the receipt of the Letter, caused a Council to be convened, before whom he produced it. The unanimous opinion they held upon it was, that it was of a very inflam∣matory tendency, and that the Author was un∣doubtedly amenable to the laws, as the Promoter of a traitorous and unconstitutional sedition. As a farther sanction, however, for the measures they intended to adopt towards him▪ an order was immediately issued to the Post Office, en∣joining all letters franked <HI>G. Gordon,</HI> to what∣ever quarter they might be addressed, to be from that time detained, and transmitted to the office of one of the Secretaries of State. In conse∣quence of this mandate, several letters, written by the deluded young Nobleman▪ were stopped, and afterwards laid before the Cabinet. Most of these were directed to Scotland, and were re∣plete with observations equally subversive of order, religion, and liberty. He gave a faith∣ful narrative of the transactions which had taken
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
place in the Metropolis; and instead of accom∣panying the relation with those expressions of horror and disapprobation which must have actuated every good and well-disposed citizen, he seemed rather to exult in the event, as no∣thing pervaded these epistles but rapturous en∣comiums on the "glorious cause," and extrava∣gant panegyrics on the noble spirit displayed by his Brethren in the defence of it. The uniform tendency of all these different letters sufficiently determined the Cabinet as to the propriety, and indeed necessity, of making the Author of them prisoner; and orders were immediately given for that purpose. He was first brought before the Council assembled at St. James's, where he was examined concerning the purport of his va∣rious epistles, and particularly interrogated as to the nature of his own designs and motives in writing them. He disclaimed all intentions of violating the public peace, and expressed the warmest attachment for the love of his country, but at the same time vindicated his adherence to the cause he was concerned in with astonishing ability and resolution. To the question, how∣ever, which was frequently and forcibly put, by different members of the Cabinet, how he could so far forget his dignity, as an immediate de∣scendant of one of the first families of his coun∣try, and also a legislator of England, as to unite with a set of the lowest men in the kingdom, and to be instrumental in producing the shock∣ing
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
disorders and irreparable injuries which had taken place? he only severally replied, "That he had not foreseen those effects in all the de∣grees to which they had extended; that he did not mean them; and was sorry for them." But against this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was urged, "Why did he, in all his letters, convey an implied approbation of these disturbances, if such was his disposition of mind as he there represented?" His Lordship made no good answer to this observation. After he had undergone an examination of upwards of an hour at St. James's, he was taken to the Horse Guards, where Lord Amherst sat in his capacity of Commander in Chief, and proceeded to a farther scrutiny into this dark and diabolical business. Here more testimony appeared; se∣veral persons were brought who swore to certain expressions of a most inflammatory tendency indeed, which had been used by his Lordship on the day when the petition was originally present∣ed to the House of Commons; his haranguing the Mob from the lobby of the House was dwelt upon, and his expressions with respect to Mr. Burke particularly sworn to. His preparations for an immediate departure into Scotland, as soon as ever the possibility of farther mischief was precluded by the interposition of the mili∣tary, was also proved as a collateral corrobora∣tion of the nature of his views; and about eight o'clock his examination finally closed, with a full conviction on the minds of the auditors, that
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
"his Lordship had been principally instrumental in convening the riotous multitude, which had for six several days and nights infested the streets of the metropolis, and that he had been by his speeches, &amp;c. abetting in producing the great and irreparable mischief to his Majesty's loyal and faithful subjects, which had subsequently arisen."—What his Lordship may have to urge in exculpation of this dreadful charge, on the day of trial, has not yet transpired; but it is hoped, for his own sake, and for the sake of the Honourable Family he sprung from, that he will be able to make some defence against an im∣putation of so black and infamous a dye.</P>
<P>On the Thursday, previous to the commit∣ment of Lord George, both Houses of Parlia∣ment had adjourned tothe Monday se'nnight, al∣ledging that most truly constitutional reason, that it was impossible to transact Parliamentary business, while the military power superceded the civil.</P>
<P>It now remains to collect such circumstances, which either escaped notice in the haste with which this account was obliged to be drawn up, or which could not without injuring the narra∣tive, have been inserted in any other place, and which may serve to corroborate what has been before asserted, relative to the audacity and wickedness of the rioters. The account shall
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
then be closed with an abstract or summary of the mischiefs committed, that is, of the principal of them: a detail of the lesser outrages, frauds, and impositions perpetrated at such a time, and in so extensive a place, is impossible to procure, and would be tedious to read, as well as relate.</P>
<P>On Wednesday evening the Rev. B. Allen was robbed in the street, opposite Mr. Langdale's distillery, Holborn-bridge, between eight and nine o'clock by a gang of pick-pockets, some of whom forcibly held him whilst his pockets were picked of a gold French made watch, seals, &amp;c. a purse with two guineas and a half, his keys, and other articles;—his pockets were turned inside out. A person decently dressed held his cane, and returned it very civilly when the affair was over.</P>
<P>Three or four several times during the general conflagration at Mr. Langdale's, &amp;c. a single fellow, with a blue cockade and a bludgeon, demanded money for the gang, threatening those who made the least hesitation, in Bedford▪row, and the adjacent streets; and so terrified were the inhabitants, his demands were complied with. But a stronger proof still of the infatuation of the mob, who concluded they had effected the total subversion of order, was the following. On Saturday, when every place was guarded, and all things peaceably settled in their former channel, a man had the temerity
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
to demand money, in the middle of the day, in Holborn. He, however, was presently secured.</P>

<P>During the first days of the commotion, parties of soldiers were continually dispatched to the aid of the Civil Magistrates, but these seem strangely to have neglected their duty.

<HEAD>ANECDOTES <HI>of the Life of</HI> LORD GEORGE GORDON. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In justice to the author, it is mentioned that these anecdotes are by another person.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>LORD George Gordon is third son to the late Duke of Gordon. He was born in London, about the year 1747 or 1748, and en∣tered at an early age into the navy. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant, and there, owing to some disgust or disappointment, he gave up his commission. His enemies take occasion to say that he retired because Lord Sandwich would not grant a very imprudent request which he made for a ship, on the moment of his having procured a seat in the House; they say that he threatened the First Lord of the Admiralty, to throw himself into the arms of the Opposition if he did not comply with his demand, and on his Lordship's refusal, that he actually did take a decided part against Ministers, and by that means quarrelled with the Duke, his brother. His friends give a very different account of this business. They say, that from his earliest years he expressed a very zealous, if not a violent at∣tachment to the Constitution of this country, and though of an amorous complexion, that he paid his court to her as his darling mistress.—Having while a Midshipman been in America, he had conceived a very particular affection for
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
the inhabitants, and when the ruinous measures were pursuing in Parliament, which terminated in the dismemberment of the empire, he took a decided part against Ministers from conviction, and not from disappointment. Having done this, and thereby had a temporary disagreement with the Duke, his brother, he had no reason to believe that Lord Sandwich would permit him to rise in the way of his profession; and he left a service in which, in the present day of degene∣racy and corruption, men rise by interest, and not by merit.</P>
<P>No man had juster pretensions to independ∣ance, though few perhaps in the House were poorer than Lord George Gordon. He has preserved through life the most guarded and de∣cent oeconomy, and with an income of between 7 and 800l. a year has maintained his integrity firm and inviolate, notwithstanding the attacks which Ministers have from time to time made upon it. One of their practices, his Lord∣ship, with indignant spirit, published in the House; Lord North, he said, had been guilty of an <HI>infamous</HI> attempt to bribe him with a place of a 1000l. a year, to give up his seat in Parlia∣ment. This charge the Minister received with a distorted face; he denied that he had been guilty of an <HI>infamous</HI> attempt, but he never intended to disprove the charge. This story is differently told. It is said that the Duke, his brother, made
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
application to the Minister for his place, and there were several interviews between them on the subject. The place was promised to his Lordship with the condition of his giving up his seat, and on this ground the treaty was broke off.</P>
<P>The part that his Lordship has taken in re∣gard to the Protestant Association is too recent in the minds of men to require recapitulation. He did not take an active part in opposition to the Bill in favour of the Papists, at the time of its passing; because, as his Lordship says, "he had not then become a speaker." We are well assured that his Lordship had no idea of produ∣cing the dreadful consequences that ensued from assembling the Association. He was well con∣vinced, at the same time, that unless the Peti∣tion of the Protestants was strengthened by an Association, there was no reason to apprehend that any regard would be paid to it. The measures which he advised and adopted, were founded on his knowledge of the venality of Parliament; and his worst enemies must ac∣knowledge that he has acted openly and candidly throughout the whole business. He gave the House to understand that 150,000 men had de∣termined to have the Act repealed; nay, he even proceeded so fairly, as to move in his place, that 100,000 stand of arms, firelocks, bayonets, and accoutrements might be transmitted to Scot∣land, to enable them to put themselves in array
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
and accomplish their purpose. The noble Lord has, through life, maintained the character of a facetious companion. He possesses a great fund of wit, and humour, and his temper is withal so sweetened with the quality of good nature, that he has never been known to sacrifice it at the shrine of satire. For the whole of this season no man has been more universally attended to in the House than his Lordship; and he has said some of the severest, and at the same time the wittiest things against both sides of the House, that have been uttered in St. Stephen's since the day of the celebrated Charles Townshend: And should his Lordship fall a sacrifice to his zeal on the present occasion, no man ever received a greater share of public respect, than his Lord∣ship will no doubt meet with.</P>

<P>MR. Thurloe (the present Lord Chancellor) spoke to the Bill. The purport of his speech was, that though he did not mean to oppose it, he would recom∣mend caution. He desired they would consider what principles the act of William and Mary had been formed upon, and thought the repeal of the penalties against Popish Priests <HI>exercising</HI> their function deserved con∣sideration.</P>
<P>The Bishop of Peterborough (in the upper House) ob∣served that the Bill ought to have been introduced at an earlier part of the session, by which means the disposition of the nation towards it might have been known; and that it was not only worthy their Lordships' attention to look into the real security of the Constitution, but to prevent alarms of imaginary danger with which ig∣norance and malice heretofore had kindled, and might again kindle flames which the authority of the law might find it difficult to extinguish.</P>

<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>THAT your Petitioners, sensible of the many blessings which, as Protestants and Britons, they enjoy, cannot but be alarmed at an Act, passed in the 18th year of the reign of his present Majesty, repealing certain penalties and disabilities imposed on the Papists by a sta∣tute enacted in the 11th and 12th years of William III. for further preventing the growth of Popery.</P>
<P>That it is with the deepest concern they petition the House against a law which has lately received the Royal Assent; but as this Act is so suddenly introduced, and so hastily passed, before the sense of the nation at large could be obtained, or any opposition formed against it, they are encouraged to hope that this application will not prove too late for redress.</P>
<P>That, notwithstanding the late Act might be in∣tended to repeal only detached parts of a single statute, your Petitioners conceive that it is an absolute repeal of the most essential clauses in that statute, and will operate, virtually, to render those Acts against the Papists that are yet unrepealed of no effect.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners apprehend that the Papists construe the late indulgence of Parliament to be a to∣leration
<PB REF="67"/>
of Popery, as appears by the Mass Houses and Schools which they are opening throughout the King∣dom; and by their printing Popish books, and publicly exposing them to sale.</P>
<P>That Popish Bishops, Priests, Jesuits, and School∣masters, now openly exercise their functions, whereby the people, especially the rising generation, are in danger of being led into superstition, idolatry, and rebellion.</P>
<P>That Papists can now purchase what lands, tene∣ments, or hereditaments they please, and inherit the same; that they will, thereby, influence our elections in future Parliaments; and that this must tend to the de∣struction of our happy constitution.</P>
<P>That as Papists can now, by legal authority, con∣fess the ecclesiastical, or spiritual jurisdiction of the Pope and See of Rome, which our laws, before the passing of the late Act, have constantly disavowed; your Peti∣tioners are very much alarmed, lest they should be in∣volved in the guilt of perjury, when called to declare upon oath, "That no foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath any jurisdiction or authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, in this realm.</P>
<P>That Popery is in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s nature intolerant, in a Pro∣testant country seditious, and, in this kingdom, disaffect∣ed to the present reigning Family; and, therefore, to encourage it, tends to the subversion of the State, to dethrone the King, and to set aside the succession of the illustrious House of Hanover to the Crown of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>That, as England and Scotland are united, your Petitioners cannot but think it a hardship upon the Peo∣ple of England, to have Popery c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untenanced among them by law, when their brethren in Scotland have been officially assured, that no law shall be made to favour Po∣pery in that country; and your Petitioners presume, that their peaceable deportment, and the constitutional steps they have taken to obtain redress, will m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et with the ap∣probation of this honourable House.</P>

<P>But enquiry has been made, and we are informed that the account was fabricated to serve some purpose: that
<PB REF="70"/>
his Lordship had received no such account, and that an exact statement, like the above, was hardly possible to procure, not to mention that many have died in hospi∣tals, and other places, since the above was published.</P>

<P>A reputable tradesman, in the neighbourhood cited, gave the Author this intelligence. The fires were made smaller and more numerous on account of the narrowness of the streets, which would otherwise have been totally destroyed; but as many, who read the first Edition, ex∣pressed a doubt about the authenticity of the informa∣tion, enquiry was made on the spot, and, it is probable, that the person who related it was deceived in the number.</P>

<P>LORD Mansfield has given the doctrine of Military interference an explanation as unexpected as it is new. He has considered them, not as soldiers, but citizens; amenable to the Civil Magistrate for their conduct; and having a right to act, in all cases of tumult, like pas∣sengers, or other persons. The Public seem, unhappily, to have acquiesced, and taken his Lordship's word for demonstration. The doctrine is specious, and its novel∣ty, joined to his Lordship's reputation, have given it the force of truth: but, if it is constitutional, the dif∣ference between the Government of England and a Mi∣litary one is imperceptible. A soldier, who is merely passing, is in a very different legal situation to a soldier under arms, called forth to act offensively and defensively: it would seem strange to hang that man for murder who only obeyed the word of command. If Lord Mansfield's assertion is true, all the soldier▪ who have been active in suppressing the Riots are liable to be tried for their lives.</P>

<P>IT has been related with great confidence, that an Officer in the service of Congress, who was a prisoner at Charles Town, said, that the Congress had much dif∣ficulty to persuade the Americans to continue the war another year, and that they were at last only prevailed upon, in consequence of being assured that the Cities of London and Westminster would be burnt and destroyed this summer. Lord Mansfield, and others supposed to have the best information, have said many things in Parliament too, by which it appears Government is of opinion that something besides Religion has been the oc∣casion of the Disturbances.</P>

<P>THIS is a newspaper anecdote; but what Mr. Burke pleaded in his Lordship's behalf, in the House of Com∣mons, was far more severe than any thing his enemies have related or invented: that is, supposing his Lord∣ship possessed of delicacy and feeling; which, however, are things by no means positively ascertained. A daily paper gives Mr. Burke's sentiments in the following words.</P>
<P>All men, he said, were not made alike. The Lord-Mayor, he supposed, was of a timid nature, and with∣out natural courage and capacity that sit some men to act a wise and decided part in trying situations. Neither had he made up, he presumed, the disadvantages of his natural infirmity and timidity, by study and culture. As he never dreamt, in his younger days, of filling so important a station as that of Lord-Mayor of the City of London, it was probable he had neglected to acquire those talents that might be requisite, in certain emergencies, to dis∣charge
<PB REF="72"/>
the duties of it: for these reasons, he hoped, they would have mercy on the <HI>poor Lord-Mayor,</HI> in considera∣tion of his natural weakness, and <HI>total want of education.</HI></P>

<HEAD>[THE Author is exceedingly obliged to the Gentleman who has taken the trouble, in so candid a manner, to correct an error into which he had unintentionally fallen. Truth, without prejudice or partiality, has been preserved, as far as it was possible, with the ut∣most assiduity, to procure it amidst that hurry and confusion, and that variety of reports which, at the moment the Pamphlet was written, prevailed. The London Association deserves every acknowledgement, every praise, not only that the Author, but that the Kingdom can bestow. The liberty of printing the following Letter, it is presumed, the Author of it will forgive, if not approve; and the original mistake is left as in the first Edition, that those who have not read that Edition may perceive the whole affair. As the following Letter does the Writer of it great ho∣nour in several respects, his Name and Address should have been inserted, as on the card he inclosed, but that it was not known whether the insertion would have been agreeable to his inclinations.]</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To</HI> WILLIAM VINCENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not 'till this morning, that a publication, un∣der your name, fell into my hand; "A Narrative of the late Riots;' which is penned with a candor and im∣partiality that assure me, you would be desirous to cor∣rect any assertion to the disadvantage of others, into which you have been misled either by ignorant or preju∣diced misinformation.</P>
<P>In the 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d page of your Pamphlet is the following paragraph. <Q>It would be wrong to forget the Armed Associations, who turned out on Thursday, though some have accused them of being very quiet and peace∣able till the danger was all over.</Q></P>
<P>In the foregoing paragraph it is easy to distinguish between two distinct particulars: in the first sentence,
<PB REF="73"/>
you seem to express some favourable sentiments, of your own, towards the behaviour of the Armed Associations; and, in the second, relate only the remarks which others made on their conduct at the late interesting crisis.</P>
<P>As a Volunteer in the London Military Association of Foot, I think it incumbent on me to inform you, that on the <HI>Wednesday</HI> afternoon we made a tender of our services to the Lord Mayor of London. Before the hour of seven, <HI>the same evening,</HI> we were under arms, and con∣tinued so all night, in the same duty with the Regulars; first protecting the Mansion House, then marching to such other parts of the City as were actually attacked. Before four in the morning, we had secured the Rioters in the house of Mr. Donovan, in Broad street▪ and saved the house of his neighbour, Mr. Gorman, from the ruin to which it had been devoted; though not without the painful necessity of committing some execution on those who were not, by repeated intreaties, to be persuaded to desist and disband.</P>
<P>Very little enquiry would fully assure you, that the services of the Armed Associations were vigorously ex∣erted, and unremittedly continued, from the moment the Civil Magistrate could be depended on not to suffer them to stand the defenceless victims of that outrage and abuse, which they had, with indignation, seen the Mili∣tary exposed to in the preceding stages of the late horrid scenes of brutality and confusion.</P>
<P>The Regulars were not permitted to do any actual service till the <HI>Wednesday evening,</HI> and from that very hour, the London Military Associations kept even pace with them, in every endeavour for the preservation of the dearest interests of the community, from the ruin with which they were threatened.</P>
<CLOSER>I am,
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your humble servant, A Volunteer in the London Military Association of Foot.</SIGNED>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I send my name and place of address inclosed, that you may▪ if you please, enquire of my reputation for ve∣racity; as an anonymous contradiction of certain facts, with the assertion of others, could not have a just claim to attention.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>GREAT care has been taken relative to the authen∣ticity of facts. Some have unavoidably been se∣lected from the <HI>public papers,</HI> but such as nobody contra∣dicts, some <HI>the author</HI> can attest, and others were collected from <HI>spectators</HI> of undoubted veracity.</P>
<P>A strong and lasting impression was fixed upon the mind of the Narra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, by being present at many of those scenes of horror he has undertaken to describe: an effort has been made to convey them as they were universally felt, but that is next to impossible.</P>
<P>A person who, in the midst of uproar and distraction, composes a Narrative, and gives it in the form of a small pamphlet, cannot be supposed to write for same; but he may be strongly affected by private and public distress: he may sigh with a weak and sickly mother, driven from her habitation at midnight, with all her little ones, terrified and crying, around her: he may groan for a mad, misguided multitude; tossing the brands of de∣struction on the head of innocence, and exposing them∣selves to present, or to future death: he may weep over the ruins of a city, and at the desolation of its innocent inhabitants.</P>
<P>The subject is worthy the talents of the ablest his∣torian: the dignity and case of one is little expected in this kind of publication.</P>
<P>If the Author has communicated ideas, so as to im∣press a <HI>faint</HI> image of that horror and detestation which every good citizen experienced, who was present at the perpetration of these lawless acts, he has effected more than he hoped. Such hope is now only inspired by the favourable reception the Public gave to the first Edition.</P>
