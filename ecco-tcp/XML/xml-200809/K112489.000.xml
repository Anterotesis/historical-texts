<HEAD>A LETTER FROM Mr. Congreve, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCEREST Critick of my Prose, or Rhime,</L>
<L>Tell how thy pleasing STOWE employs thy Time,</L>
<L>Say, COBHAM, what amuses thy Retreat?</L>
<L>Or Stratagems of War, or Schemes of State?</L>
<L>Dost thou recal to Mind with Joy, or Grief,</L>
<L>Great <HI>MALBRO</HI>'s Actions? That immortal Chief,</L>
<L>Whose slightest Trophy rais'd in each Campaign,</L>
<L>More than suffic'd to signalize a Reign?</L>
<L>Does thy remembrance rising warm thy Heart,</L>
<L>With Glory past, where Thou thy self hadst Part,</L>
<L>Or dost thou grieve indignant, now to see,</L>
<L>The fruitless End of all thy Victory?</L>
<L>To see th' Audacious Foe, so late subdu'd,</L>
<L>Dispute those Terms for which so long they su'd,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
As if BRITANNIA now were sunk so low,</L>
<L>To beg that Peace she wonted to bestow,</L>
<L>Be far that Guilt! be never known that Shame!</L>
<L>That ENGLAND shou'd retract her rightful Claim,</L>
<L>Or ceasing to be dreaded and ador'd,</L>
<L>Stain with her Pen the Lustre of her Sword,</L>
<L>Or dost thou give the Winds a far to blow.</L>
<L>Each vexing Thought, and heart-devouring Woe,</L>
<L>And fix thy Mind alone on rural Scenes,</L>
<L>To turn the level'd Lawns to liquid Plains,</L>
<L>To raise the creeping Rills from humble Beds,</L>
<L>And force the latent Springs to lift their Heads,</L>
<L>On watry Columns, Capitals to rear,</L>
<L>That mix their flowing Curls with upper Air.</L>
<L>Or dost Thou, weary grown, these Works neglect,</L>
<L>No Temples Statues, Obblisques erect,</L>
<L>But catch the morning Breeze from fragrant Meads,</L>
<L>Or shun the noontide Ray in wholsome Shades,</L>
<L>Or slowly walk along the mazy Wood,</L>
<L>To mediate on all that's wise and good,</L>
<L>For Nature bountiful in thee has join'd,</L>
<L>A Person pleasing with a worthy Mind,</L>
<L>Not given the Form alone, but Means, and Art,</L>
<L>To draw the Eye, or to allure the Heart,</L>
<L>Poor were the Praise in Fortune to excel,</L>
<L>Yet want the Way to use that Fortune well.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
While thus adorn'd, while thus with Virtue crown'd,</L>
<L>At Home in Peace, Abroad in Arms renown'd,</L>
<L>Graceful in Form, and winning in Address</L>
<L>While well you think, what aptly you express,</L>
<L>With Health, with Honour, with a fair Estate,</L>
<L>A Table free, and eloquently neat.</L>
<L>What can be added more to mortal Bliss?</L>
<L>What can he want who stands possest of this?</L>
<L>What can the fondest wishing Mother more</L>
<L>Of Heaven attentive for her Son implore?</L>
<L>And yet a Happiness remains unknown,</L>
<L>Or to Philosophy reveal'd alone;</L>
<L>A Precept, which unpractis'd renders vain,</L>
<L>Thy flowing Hopes, and Pleasure turns to Pain.</L>
<L>Shou'd Hope, and Fear thy Heart alternate tear,</L>
<L>Or Love, or Hate, or Rage, or anxious Care,</L>
<L>Whatever Passions may thy Mind infest,</L>
<L>(Where is that Mind which Passions ne'er molest?)</L>
<L>Amidst the Pangs of such intestine Strife,</L>
<L>Still think the present Day, the last of Life;</L>
<L>Defer not till to Morrow to be wise,</L>
<L>To Morrow's Sun to thee may never rise.</L>
<L>Or shou'd to Morrow chance to cheer thy Sight,</L>
<L>With her enliv'ning and unlookt-for Light,</L>
<L>How grateful will appear her dawning Rays!</L>
<L>As Favours unexpected doubly please.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Who thus can think and who such thoughts pursues,</L>
<L>Content may keep his Life, or calmly lose;</L>
<L>All Proofs of this Thou may'st thy self receive,</L>
<L>When Leisure from Affairs will give thee Leave,</L>
<L>Come, see thy Friend, retir'd without Regret,</L>
<L>Forgetting Care, or striving to forget;</L>
<L>In easy Contemplation soothing Time</L>
<L>With Morals much, and now and then with Rhime,</L>
<L>Not so robust in Body, as in Mind,</L>
<L>And always undejected, tho' declin'd;</L>
<L>Not wondering at the World's new wicked Ways,</L>
<L>Compar'd with those of our Fore-fathers Days,</L>
<L>For Virtue now is neither more or less,</L>
<L>And Vice is only varied in the Dress;</L>
<L>Believe it, Men have ever been the same,</L>
<L>And all the Golden Age, is but a Dream.</L>
