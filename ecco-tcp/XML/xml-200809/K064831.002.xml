<P>A Clergyman of the Church of Scotland. He published, in 1761, a burlesque on Fingal, entitled, "Three Beautiful and Important Passages omitted by the Translator of Fingal," in which he mocks the stile of Ossian with a crude species of humour. Mr. Macdonald has also written the Independent a novel, in two duodecimo volumes, and Velina a poetical fragment, published in 1782.</P>

<P>The Author of an History of the Reign of George III. King of Great Britain, in four octavo

volumes, of which the first was published in 1770, and the fourth in 1796. This publication, though certainly not without the merit of utility, cannot, on many accounts, be said to entitle Mr. Macfarlan to first-rate distinction as an Historian. We believe this gentleman formerly attempted a Translation of Ossian's Poems into Latin Hexameters, of which he published the first book of "Temora," by way of specimen, in 1796. Those who are acquainted with the characteristic genius and style of Ossian, as well as with those of the Roman classics, will wonder at such an undertaking. The specimen, produced upon this occasion, was a very indifferent one.</P>

<P>Of Aberdeen. The author of a treatise on "The Theory and Practice of finding the Longi∣tude at Sea or Land," in two thin octavo volumes published in 1793, a valuable work, in which he displays a most extensive and accurate acquaintance with his subject. Mr. Mackay also wrote the arti∣cles, Navigation, Parallax, Pendulum, Projection of the Sphere, Ship-Building, and Naval Tactics, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica; and is about to present the world with a Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Navigation, and another, in three volumes, on the Theory and Practice of Astronomy.</P>

<HEAD>MACKENZIE, HENRY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>A native of Scotland, and a gentleman, whose elegance as a writer have justly entitled him to the name of the Addison of the North. The first cha∣racter which he assumed as an author, was that of a sentimental and pathetic writer, in which he met with considerable success. "The Man of Feeling," a novel, his first publication, made its appearance in 1771, and was very favourably received. In the same year he published, "The Pursuits of Happi∣ness," a poem; and two years afterward, "The Man of the World," a novel, in two duodecimo volumes. The Novel of Julia de Rubignè, in two volumes, duodecimo, is also, we believe, to be at∣tributed to his pen. In the dramatic line of com∣position, he has produced the Prince of Tunis, a tragedy, acted at Edinburgh, in 1773, and, we be∣lieve he altered the Fatal Curiosity of Lillo, as it was represented at the Hay Market Theatre. Mr. Mackenzie edited, in 1793, a quarto volume of "Poems by the late Rev. Dr. Thomas Blacklock, together, with an Essay on the Education of the Blind," to which he prefixed a most interesting and elegant Account of the Author's Life and Writings. He announced, at the same time, the intended pub∣lication of some Sermons and other prose works, by Dr. Blacklock, which, we belive, have not yet
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
appeared. In the year 1779, when a society of li∣terary gentlemen at Edinburgh, came to the reso∣lution of publishing a Periodical Paper, Mr. Mac∣kenzie, then of the Exchequer in that City, was entrusted with the conduct of the work. His nu∣merous Papers in the Mirror, the first production of that Society, have been particularly distinguished for their elegance and neatness. To the Lounger, a periodical paper, afterward published by the same Society, he likewise contributed some very distinguished Essays. Indeed, we are of opinion, that without the attraction of Mr. Mackenzie's per∣formances, neither of these publications would have ranked very highly in the class of Periodical Pa∣pers. But possessed of these, they may boast a saving principle, and a sterling excellence in their conformation, which gives them a durable value and will insure them a lasting estimation among the works of taste.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is a sentence which was passed upon Mr. Macken∣zie, by a reviewer of the day, upon the appearance of his Man of Feeling.</P><P><Q>It is probably a first work; and from the specimen it affords of the talents of its author, we should not be disposed to think that he will ever attain to any great eminence in literature. He may amuse him∣self at the foot of Parnassus; but to ascend the steeps of the moun∣tain must be the task of those, on whom their benignant stars have bestowed the rare gifts of true genius.</Q>!!</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>MACKENZIE, RODERICK, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>An Officer, of a character no less honourable in the literary than in the military world. He pub∣lished, in 1787, Strictures on Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton's History of the Campaigns in North Ame∣rica, in 1780 and 1781. Mr. Mackenzie was person∣ally concerned, as well as Col. Tarleton, in some of the most considerable actions of these campaigns, and he animadverts with the greatest severity upon the Colonel's "History." His publication seems to have been undertaken from a motive of great generosity and friendly zeal, viz. to vindicate the fame of Lord Cornwallis, whose military conduct had suffered certain disrepectful insinuations from Colonel Tarleton, and whose distance from home deprived him of an opportunity of defending him∣self. Mr. Mackenzie has, since that time, pub∣lished a "Sketch of the War with Tippoo Sul∣taun," in two quarto volumes, which were printed at Calcutta, in 1793 and 1794. This work con∣tains much excellent and circumstantial information, related in a strain of impartiality, and in an honest unassuming manner, which cannot fail to gratify every reader.</P>

<HEAD>MACKENZIE, ANNA MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>This lady has produced several Novels, at the Leadenhall-Street Press dedicated to the Goddess of Wisdom. Among them are, "Monmouth," "Danish Massacre," "Mysteries Elucidated," and "the Neapolitan." They are frequently volumi∣nous, and, sometimes, of a species somewhat su∣perior to the generality of the fungous productions of that literary hot-bed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>MACKINTOSH, JAMES, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>This gentleman published, in 1791, <HI>Vindiciae Gallicae,</HI> a Defence of the French Revolution and its English Admirers, against the Accusations of Mr. Burke, which has been almost universally al∣lowed to be one of the best written pamphlets ever produced in our language. We believe Mr. Mack∣intosh is also the author of two octavo volumes of Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, published ano∣nimously in 1782. They consist of a series of fa∣miliar well-written Letters, abounding in Ori∣ental Politics, and are particularly severe upon Go∣vernor Hastings. They gave offence to some of our East indian Nabobs, and were answered in a strain of Welch asperity by Captain Joseph Price,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
who had complained of personal ill-treatment from Mr. Francis, and who now attributed these Travels to an agent employed by him, to traduce the cha∣racter of Governor Hastings.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>MACKNIGHT, REV. JAMES, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>An eminent Clergyman of the Church of Scot∣land, who is celebrated for his learned and useful labours in illustration and defence of the New Tes∣tament. He published, in 1755, his celebrated "Harmony of the four Gospels," in a quarto vo∣lume; and, in 1764, "The Truth of the Gospel History shewed," in a quarto volume. Both of these works have experienced the success to which such laborious and masterly performances are entitled. In 1786, Dr. Macknight published, in quarto, "A new literal Translation, from the original Greek, of the Apostle Paul's first and second Epistles to the Thessalonians," which was intended as a spe∣cimen of a literal Translation of all the Apostolic Epistles, with Commentaries, Notes, and Essays, about which he had for many years been employed. This complete work did not make its appearance till 1795, when it was published, in four volumes, quarto, and added a new laurel to the brow of this, respectable veteran in biblical literature.</P>

<HEAD>MACLAINE, REV. ARCHIBALD, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>A native of Scotland, and late Minister of the English Church at the Hague. He published, so long ago as the year 1752, a single Sermon on the Death of the Prince of Orange. In 1765, his masterly Translation of Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History made its first appearance, in two volumes, quarto. It experienced a most favourable recep∣tion, and was soon reprinted, in six volumes, octavo, which is the form in which all the subsequent edi∣tions have been published. A Supplement to the quarto edition, containing the corrections, additional notes and dissertations which had been added to the octavo edition, was published by Dr. Maclaine, in quarto, in 1768. Few publications, upon their first appearance, have been more generally read than Mr. Soame Jenyns' View of the internal Evidence of Christianity. Upon the occasion of this publication, Dr. Maclaine addressed a Series of Letters to that gentleman, published in a duodecimo volume, in 1777. These Letters were written to serve the best purposes of Christianity, upon a due conside∣ration of the distinguished eminence of Mr. Je∣nyns as a writer, of the singular mixture of piety, wit, error, wisdom, and paradox, exhibited in his publication, and of his defence of Christianity, upon principles which would lead men to enthu∣siasm,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
or to scepticism, according to their different dispositions. His only publications, since this time, have been two Fast Sermons, preached in 1793 and 1797.</P>

<HEAD>MACNALLY, LEONARD, ESQ.</HEAD>

<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
of the Public Ledger, and has, since that time, we believe, been concerned in other Newspapers. In 1782, he wrote a sensible pamphlet, entitled, "The Claims of Ireland;" but he has been chiefly distinguished as a dramatic writer. His first piece, "Retaliation," a farce, was acted at Covent Gar∣den, in 1782, and received with uncommon applause. Tristram Shandy, a piece, in two acts, was favoura∣bly received in the following year; and, in the years 1785 and 1786, he produced, Fashionable Levities, a comedy, and the April Fool, a farce. Mr. Macnal∣ly displayed considerable ability in translating from the French of M. Sedaine, the historical Romance of <HI>Richard Coeur de Lion.</HI> It was brought out at Drury Lane, in 1786, and greatly preferred to a piece of the same name, which had been repre∣sented at the other house.</P>

He has, since that time, written, '"The Harp," a legendary tale, which gave occasion to the Scotch proverb, "I'll never burn my harp for a woman," and which, in the dress he has given it, is a beautiful piece of senti∣mental poetry; "Scotland's Skaith," a most ele∣gant tale in verse; and "The Waes of War," a very beautiful sequel of that tale.</P>

Mr. Macready has, of late, become Play-mender, as well as Actor, and has written, "The Irishman In London," a farce, and the Bank Note, a co∣medy, which were produced in 1793 and 1795, and are both very indifferent performances.</P>

This per∣formance may boast the characteristics of familiarity, perspicuity, and elegance. About the same time, Dr. Madan gained the Seatonian Prize, for a poe∣tical Essay on the Call of the Gentiles. His Lordship

These Discourses, and the elegant prefixed Dissertation on that species of composition, have been highly ad∣mired as polished specimens in their kind, and place the genius and judgement of their author in a most respectable point of view.

He published, in 1794, "Letters to the Peers of Scotland," in an octavo volume, a work too much of an inflammatory cast; and his Lordship was not returned one of the six∣teen Peers of Scotland in the present Parliament. He has also published "Thoughts on Finance," a pamphlet; and several of his Speeches have reach∣ed the press.

<HEAD>MALONE, EDMUND, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>Of Queen Ann Street East. This gentleman, a native of Ireland, is the son of the late Attorney General of that Kingdom, and brother to Lord Sunderlin. He boasts a very high and deserved reputation in the literary world, as an Editor of Shakspeare, and appears to have devoted almost the whole of his time to the study and illustra∣tion of his immortal Author. Mr. Malone has written several Prologues and Epilogues, and published, in 1780, a very valuable Supplement, in two octavo volumes, to the edition of Shak∣speare's Plays, published, in 1778, by Johnson and Stevens. In 1790, he produced his edition of the Plays and Poems of Shakspeare, in ten crown oc∣tavo
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
volumes, which, though inferior in splendour to the elegant edition since published by Mr. Ste∣vens, has obtained its editor most distinguished cre∣dit for his assiduity and critical accumen. Two years after the appearance of this work, Mr. Ma∣lone published a Letter to Dr. Farmer, relative to some distorted facts, in a pamphlet, entitled, "Cur∣sory Criticisms" on his edition of Shakspeare; and in 1796, an octavo volume, entitled, "An En∣quiry into the Authenticity of certain Miscellaneous Papers, &amp;c. attributed to Shakspeare." The latter of these performances had the honour of giving the finishing stroke to the infamous forgery of the Shaksperian MSS. (vide Ireland) and if we extend our indulgence to some extraneous matter, and a certain self-complacent, sarcastic asperity, flowing through the volume, we cannot but pronounce it, a most masterly piece of criticism, and a very learned and entertaining book. By this work Mr. Malone made a pious offering to the Manes of his celebrated author, and gave the public a new proof of his indefatigable diligence and accuracy. Mr. Malone was one of the executors of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and published his works, in two volumes, quarto, in 1797, prefixing an Account of the Life and Writings of the Author.</P>

Nevertheless the subject of our present article gave his first pub∣lication the title of "A Royal Road to Geometry." This useful work appeared, in an octavo volume, in 1775, and was republished, with considerable additions and improvements, in 1793. He has also published "A complete Treatise on Perspective, in Theory and Practice," published in folio, in 1776, and an Essay concerning the Publication of Works on Science and Literature, by subscription. As a writer on subjects of science, Mr. Malton's great∣est fault appears to be his prolixity.</P>

He has resided some years in a German University, and published, in 1793, at the Cambridge press, in three octavo volumes, a Translation into English of the first part of the fourth edition of Michaelis' In∣troduction to the New Testament, a work which he has executed with most distinguished ability, and which exhibits, in our language, a counter∣part of the excellent performance of the German Professor, whose name will be ever uttered with respect, as long as learning is an object of esteem. Mr. Marsh has been, for some time, employed in preparing the remainder of this valuable work for the press. He has also published the Substance of two excellent Discourses, preached before the Uni∣versity of Cambridge, in 1792; the one on the Usefulness and Necessity of Theological Leaning to

those who are designed for Holy Orders, the other on the Authenticity of the five Books of Moses. And in 1795, he printed at Leipzig, an octavo vo∣lume of Letters to the late Mr. Archdeacon Travis, in confirmation of the opinion that a Greek MS. in the public Library at Cambridge, is one of the seven quoted by R. Stephens at 1 John v. 7; a volume, which, notwithstanding the whimsical ap∣pearance of an algebraical theorem, which he has introduced for determining the identity of MSS. and which has drawn a smile from some of his readers, is a new proof of his learning, diligence, and accuracy.</P>

In the year 1752, he had the honour of obtaining, with Dr. Porteus, Bishop of London, the Chancellor's Medals at Cambridge, on their first institution. Baron Ma∣seres' first publication was a Dissertation on the Use of the Negative Sign in Algebra, which was published in quarto, in 1759; and he, soon after∣ward, wrote "Elements of plain Trigonomety, in an octavo volume. In 1775, he published an Ac∣count of the Proceedings of the British, and other Protestant Inhabitants of Quebec, in order to ob∣tain an House of Assembly in that province, an octavo volume; and two years afterward, vol.

Four years after this, he published by order of the Com∣missioners of Longitude, an Account of Mr. John Harrison's Watch. In 1774, were published, by the President and Council of the Royal Society, at the public expence, his Tables for computing the apparent Places of the fixed Stars, and reducing Observations of the Planets, in a folio volume. Two years after this, he produced the first volume (in folio) of his Astronomical Observations, made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich from the year 1765, the continuation of which, to within a few years of the present time, has since ap∣peared.

<HEAD>MATHIAS, THOMAS JAMES, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>Clerk to her Majesty's Treasurer, and a gentle∣man of most distinguished character as an elegant scholar and a worthy man. He was educated at Eton School, took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Cam∣bridge, in 1774, and was, for some time, Fellow of Trinity College. His first publication was a
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
quarto pamphlet, in 1781, consisting of Runic Odes, imitated from the Norse Tongue. Two years af∣terward, he published in a small octavo volume, an Essay on the Evidence External and Internal, relating to the Poems attributed to Thomas Row∣ley. This performance contains a general view of the whole controversy respecting those poems, and is justly entitled to the character of a candid and comprehensive Essay. We believe that Dr. Glynn, of Cambridge, gave Mr. Mathias some assistance in this work. In these latter days Mr. Mathias has amused himself and the public, with several sa∣tirical pieces, which, while the times are peculi∣arly in need of such effusions, do the highest honour to his wit and talents. It is not without some scru∣ples that we speak on this subject, as his publica∣tions of this cast have always been anonymous, and the author has been studiously concealed. Yet when we reflect that in every such instance his ex∣ertions have done him the utmost credit, both as a scholar and as a man, and, that it is our duty to re∣port our information, on these occasions, to the public, we trust we may proceed. To his pen, we have little hesitation in ascribing the three following excellent poetical pamphlets, viz. "The Political Dramatist of the House of Commons, in 1795;" a Pair of Epistles to Dr. Randolph and the Earl of Jersey; and the Imperial Epistle from Kien Long to George III; as also a Letter to the Marquis of Buck∣ingham, chiefly on the Subject of the numerous

Mr. Mansell, Public Orator at Cambridge. Upon this we will only remark that he is a very intimate friend of Mr. Mathias. We also refer the reader to a note in page 205 of our first volume.</NOTE> in four parts, of which the first was published in 1794, remained long unknown. We subjoin this excellent performance to the above list, from a conviction, that, considered in every possible point of view, it cannot but redound most highly to the credit of the writer. The cause of literature has never been supported, in a day of danger and perver∣sion, upon principles more excellent, or with powers better adapted to their object. The author of this Poem may claim the character of a Noble Patriot in Literature, of a man, whose Piety and Orthodoxy, are an Ornament to Human Nature and the Chris∣tian Faith; of a Politician, whose sentiments and example are an Honour to the Government and Ministry under which he lives; of a Scholar, whose attainments are of First-Rate Excellence; and of a Satirist, whose keenest arrow is always directed by the hand of a Gentleman. The few false opi∣nions and false judgements which this poem contains are trifling indeed, when compared with its nume∣rous merits. The various and extensive learning exhibited in the Notes, is conveyed in so lively a manner as to delight almost every reader. More

<HEAD>MAURICE, REV. THOMAS, A.M.</HEAD>
<P>Historiographer we believe to the East India Com∣pany, and a very learned, ingenious, and diligent Scholar. He was educated at University College, Oxford, afterward became Chaplain to the 97th Regi∣ment, and lived for some years at Woodford, in Essex. He published, in 1779, a quarto volume of "Poems and Miscellaneous Pieces," with a free Translation of the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles. Most of these poems had appeared in print before, separately; "Ne∣therby," the oldest of them, was published in 1776. They possess much merit, but did not obtain their author that credit which his latter writings have ac∣quired him. About a year, previously to this vo∣lume, Mr. Maurice had printed a Fast Sermon, which we believe is his only publication in the class of divinity. In 1782, he wrote <HI>Ierne Rediviva,</HI> an
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
ode, inscribed to the Volunteers of Ireland; and, two years afterward, "Westminster Abbey," an elegiac poem, both of which pieces increased his reputation as a poet. In 1789, Mr. Maurice pub∣lished Panthea, a tragedy, from a story in Xeno∣phon, which did not add greatly to his fame; and relinquishing here the line of authorship, which he had hitherto traced, he has since acquired the greatest eminence and distinction, in another track. This is a circumstance which cannot but appear surprising; for what reader, with all his approba∣tion of Mr. Maurice's abilities as an historian, can help yielding the palm to his poetical talents? In the year 1790, he published a Letter addressed to the Directors of the East India Company, contain∣ing proposals for printing a History of the Revolu∣tions of the Empire of Hindostan, from the earliest Ages; and has, since that time, published "Indian Antiquities," in six volumes, octavo (the two first of which appeared in 1793) and the first volume (in quarto) of the History of Hindostan, published in 1795. The former of these works is introductory to and illustrative of the latter. Although it was sanctioned by the approbation of the East India Company and Sir William Jones, it obtained only <HI>a dozen</HI> subscribers in the course of twelve months! At present, however, the merit of the author of these works is well known to the public, and has obtained him a most distinguished reputation. His erudition, diligence, and ingenuity are very remark∣able.
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
His greatest fault is, an imagination too flo∣rid and poetical for his undertaking, and not suffi∣ciently reducible to method and the power of con∣densing. In 1795, Mr. Maurice published, in quar∣to, a beautiful elegiac Poem, sacred to the Memory and Virtues of Sir William Jones, of which it is no mean praise to say, that it is superior to Mr. Hay∣ley's Poem on the same occasion.</P>

<HEAD>MELMOTH, WILLIAM, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>This literary Veteran has been distinguished for more than fifty years, as one of the most elegant scholars and classical writers of his time. Few au∣thors have contributed so much to the improvement of our style, or have exhibited, in their works, such complete models of elegant writing, such specimens of correct choice and perspicuous arrangement of words, and of harmonious construction of periods. Mr. Melmoth is a son of the late eminent Advo∣cate of the same name, who wrote an admirable treatise on the great importance of a Religious Life. He died in 1743, and it is said of him, 'few ever passed a more useful, none a more blameless life.' The first publication of the subject of this article was "The Letters of Sir Thomas Fitzos∣borne, on several Subjects," in an octavo volume. These admired Letters made their first appearance about the year 1742, and have experienced that favourable reception and general circulation, to which their very sterling merit entitles them. Mr. Melrmoth's elegant Translation of Pliny's Epistles made its first appearance, in two octavo volumes, in 1747, about four years before the Translation by the Earl of Orrery, to which it was justly preferred. In 1753, he published, in three octavo volumes, a Tran∣slation of Cicero's Letters to his Friends, with Re∣marks
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
in which the <HI>patriot character</HI> ofth a celebrated Roman is justly questioned; and, in 1773 and 1777, Translations of Cicero's Cato and Laelius, each in an octavo volume, with Remarks. These finished performances have acquired Mr. Melmoth the great∣est reputation possible, as an elegant and accurate scholar. They will probably speak for him while Roman and English eloquence can be united. Yet, when we consider them as specimens of translation, we cannot help thinking, that he is too often led away by the vanity of improving upon his author, that he frequently sacrifices his original to a false refinement and an overspun delicacy of phrase, and lastly, that he has too much of what the Greeks express by the forcible term <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. In the year 1794, after a long repose, Mr. Melmoth was con∣strained to resume his pen, upon the occasion of a very unprovoked attack from Mr. Bryant, in his Treatise on the Truth of the Christian Religion. The grounds of this attack were Mr. Melmoth's remarks in his Translation of Pliny's Letters, re∣specting Trajan's persecution of the Christians in Bythinia, and he wrote a pamphlet in Answer to Mr. Bryant, in which he vindicated himself with great ability, and proved his point. Two years after this, Mr. Melmoth published, "Memoirs of a late eminent Advocate" (his father), in a thin octavo volume; which is a tribute of filial piety, not less elegant than merited.</P>

<P>This gentleman is a native of the Metropolis, and son of a late Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company.

Upon the death of his father he bought a com∣mission in the Horse-guards, and was, for several years, Adjutant and Lieutenant to the first troop, commanded by Lord Lothian. He afterward quit∣ted this service, and travelled, for some years, on the continent. Mr. Merry made a long stay at Florence, and was elected a Member of the fa∣mous Academy Della Crusca. A few years ago, he married the celebrated actress Miss Brunton, who then quitted the stage. During his residence at Florence, Mr. Merry was a principal contributor to the "Florence Miscellany," which was written by a few English of both sexes, who had met by chance at Florence, and was superintended by Mrs. Piozzi. In 1787, he published, in London, "Pau∣lina, or the Russian Daughter," a poetical tale, founded on fact; and in the year following, "Di∣versity,"
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
a poem. He has also published "The Laurel of Liberty," a poem; "Lorenzo," a tragedy, represented at Covent Garden; an Ode for the 14th of July, 1791, which was performed at the Crown and Anchor Tavern; "Fenelon, or the Nuns of Cambray," a serious drama, altered from the French; and "The Pains of Memory," a poem, published in 1796. An Ode on the Recovery of his Majesty, recited by Mrs. Siddons at a Gala given by the Subscribers to Brookes' Club, as well as a comic-opera, entitled, "The Magician no Conjuror," acted four nights in the winter of 1792, are also to be attributed to his pen. On the 29th of June, 1787, Mr. Merry sent a pretty little poem, entitled, the Adieu and Recall to Love, to the World, a newspaper of the day, with the signature Della Crusca. It was answered by a poem, enti∣tled, the Pen, signed Anna Matilda. The corre∣spondence thus begun, was from poetical sym∣pathy kept up, at intervals, for two years. Many new correspondents came forward, but the writers remained long unknown to the public and to one another. Time, at last, discovered Della Crusca and Anna Matilda, to be Mr. Merry and Mrs. Ro∣binson, who had an interview toward the conclusion of the correspondence. In the mean time the po∣etry, some of which is very pretty, attracted a good deal of notice, and was reprinted, in volumes, under the title of "The Poetry of the World." It has now reached a fourth edition, in two duode∣cimo
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
volumes, entitled, "The British Album." Mr. Merry's pieces, in this collection, have the greatest claim to distinction of any. His poem, "Diversity" and "Ambitions Vengeance," a tra∣gic-drama, are to be found in these volumes. In speaking of Mr. Merry's pretensions to same, as a poet, we must observe that he has been loudly de∣cried and stigmatised by an elegant satirist of the present day, (vide William Gifford, Esq.) who has said of one of his pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Laurel of Liberty.</NOTE> that it is distinguished by "Downright nonsense, Downright frigidity, and downright doggerel." We own that his false glitter, his negligence, and his obscurity are frequently highly reprehensible, yet, cannot but allow, that his pretensions to poetical merit are often great and striking, while the spirit of liberty and benevolence which breathes through his writings seems ardent and sincere. His poem, entitled, "The Pains of Memory," has been preferred by many readers, to Mr. Rogers' popular poem "The Pleasures of Memory."</P>

and strength of character, which entitle him to the highest admiration as a citizen of that community. ford, and has bestowed much time and attention on his favourite study of antiquities. His chief work, the History of Greece, is a performance which does him infinite credit. To those who are acquainted with the intricacy of many parts of Grecian His∣tory, with the extreme difficulty of collecting the scattered members of it, of detecting the supposi∣titious and doubtful among what is related by infe∣rior or later authors, and of ascertaining and ar∣ranging the genuine; and lastly, without the assist∣ance of invention, of forming, from parts so broken and dispersed, a harmonizing whole, he will ap∣pear highly to deserve the character of a learned and accurate historian. His History of Greece is not the work of a closet critic, or a monkish phi∣losopher; but owes its existence to a most compre∣hensive mind and correct judgement, happily blend∣ed with extensive knowledge, and an acquaintance with the modes and manners of life. He frequently and his union of characters, soldier, seaman, states∣man, scholar, poet, and philosopher; while his just estimation of <HI>his</HI> invaluable guides Thucydides and Xenophon, increases our admiration of the soldier-philosopher who is our own. Much of the earlier part of this valuable work was written in camps and in quarters during the American war. It was
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
first published by single quarto volumes, of which the first appeared in 1784, two years previous to the History by Dr. Gillies (vide that name). At present three of these volumes are published, and the third edition was printed in octavo, each of the original volumes forming two of these. Ten years previous to the first appearance of this work, Mr. Mitford had published, anonymously, an Essay upon to illustrate that of the English Language; and, in 1791, he wrote a pamphlet, entitled, "Considera∣tions on the Opinion stated by the Lords of the Committee of Council, in a Representation to the King, upon the Corn Laws, that Great Britain is unable to produce Corn sufficient for its own Con∣sumption, &amp;c."</P>
<P>In his most distinguished character, as an au∣thor, we assert without hesitation of Mr. Mitford, that, the industry with which he has collected his materials from ancient sources, and brought toge∣ther from distant quarters, whatever might serve to which he discovers in comparing, the various repre∣sentations given by different authors of the same facts, his perfect originality of thought and expres∣sion, the display of general knowledge which he so agreably and judiciously introduces, his com∣prehension of mind in the arrangement of the whole, his found learning, his strength of judge∣ment, his diligent investigation, all unite in enti∣tling
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
him to the first place among the historians of Greece. It is unfortunate that amid so much per∣fection there should be found a single blemish. Yet, the style of Mr. Mitford can certainly not be said to possess that grace and polish, which would dis∣play to most advantage the many excellencies of his writings. With the generality of readers, the beau∣ties of style are of the highest consideration. Could Mr. Mitford boast this among his other superiori∣ties, few indeed would be the historians who would have greater claims to distinction!</P>

Two years after this, he wrote a View of Society and Manners in Italy, which, as the observations it contains oc∣curred in the same tour, so is it to be considered as

a continuation of the above work, in merit, as well as subject. These volumes have seen several edi∣tions since their first publication. In 1786, Dr. Moore published an octavo volume of "Medical Sketches;" and, three years afterward, his cele∣brated novel, entitled, "Zeluco," in two volumes, octavo. Dr. Moore accompanied the Earl of Lau∣derdale to Paris, in 1792, and was present during the horrid massacre of the 2d of September. Soon after his return to England, he published a Journal dur∣ing his Residence in France, in two volumes, oc∣tavo, which is a most valuable and authentic work; and, in 1795, he produced a View of the Causes and Progress of the French Revolution, in two more octavo volumes. He has, since that time, written Edward, a novel, in two octavo volumes, which, like Zeluco, exhibits various views of hu∣man nature, but its characters are more indige∣nous to our own soil. It is hardly necessary for us to add of so popular a writer as Mr. Moore, that his works discover him to possess great insight into human nature, and that happy union of acute dis∣cernment, with a lively imagination, by which he is enabled to describe its intricacies with the greatest pleasantry.</P>

<HEAD>MORE, HANNAH.</HEAD>
<P>Formerly a School-mistress at Bristol, and a lady justly celebrated for her literary accomplishments. The elegant simplicity of her poems, and the pious and virtuous sentiments which they inculcate, come with peculiar grace from a female pen. Her first publication was a pastoral drama, entitled, "The Search of Happiness," which appeared in 1773. It was written at the age of eighteen for some female friends, who played the respective characters in private parties. Though the plot of this little piece is perfectly inartificial, the poetry which it contains does infinite credit to the powers of such early years, and it experienced a very favourable reception. In the following year, Mrs. More pub∣lished the Inflexible Captive, founded on the story of Regulus, an excellent tragedy considered as a literary composition, and which was acted one night at Bath. Sir Eldred of the Bower, and the Bleeding Rock, two beautiful legendary tales, were published together, in quarto, in 1776. The lat∣ter is in the manner of Ovid, and the pretty fiction at the conclusion had its origin from a rock, near the author's residence in Somersetshire, whence a crimson stream flows, occasioned by the red strata over which the water makes its way from the mountains. Mrs. More has also. written an Ode
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
to Dragon, Mr. Garrick's House-Dog; Essays on various Subjects, principally designed for young La∣dies, an octavo volume; the tragedy of Percy, founded on the Gabrielle de Vergy of M. de Bel∣loy; the Fatal Falsehood, a tragedy; Sacred Dra∣mas, the subjects of which are taken from the Bi∣ble, and Sensibility, a poem; Florio and the Bas Bleu, two poems; Slavery, a poem; and Remarks on the Speech of M. Dupont, made in the Nati∣onal Convention of France, on the Subjects of Re∣ligion and public Education. The profits of the last of these publications were to be given to the French emigrant clergy. Each of these performances bears genuine marks of the sterling abilities and pro∣ficiency of their author. United, they entitle her to high eminence, indeed, among female writers. Mrs. More wrote the preface to Anne Yearsley's (the Bristol Milk-maid) poems, and is supposed to be concerned in several little pieces distributed among the poor, by a society under the active patronage of the worthy Bishop of London.

He published, in 1779, "The Doctrine of Annuities and Assurances on Lives and Survi∣vorships," in an octavo volume, which is a very ingenious performance. About a year after this, he was engaged in a philosophical controversy with Dr. Adair Crawford on the subject of Animal Heat, and wrote a pamphlet, entitled, "An Examina∣tion" of that gentleman's Theory. In 1792, he published a Review of Dr. Price's Writings on the Subject of the Finances of this Kingdom, in an octavo pamphlet, which has been reprinted.

view he was entered at Lincoln's Inn, but has never been called to the bar. His maiden-offering to the stage, was a comic Song in Mr. Reynolds' comedy of Notoriety. He has, since that time, written Columbus, an historical play; the Children in the Wood, a farce; Zorinski; the Way to get Married; and a Cure for the Heart Ache, come∣dies. The first of these pieces was published in 1792. It is a queer compound, and was vehe∣mently accused, upon its first appearance, by Mr. Thelwall, as a shameful plagiarism from an histo∣rical opera, entitled, "The Incas, or the Peruvian Virgin," which he had offered, without success, to Mr. Harris, nine months previously. Zorinski has also been accused as a plagiarism from Brooke's Gustavus Vasa. Mr. Morton's "Cure for the Heart Ache," is, in our opinion, the best of his dramatic pieces. They have, many of them, ex∣perienced considerable favour from the public, and have raised their author to the character of a very successful modern play-writer. As to their <HI>absolute</HI> merit, however, we must observe, that, although they have been approved in an age, in which dra∣matic composition is at a most melancholy ebb; in which our plays wear no longer the stamp of real life, neither does their colouring shew the breathing vivacity of original observation; in which the strongest effort of dramatic satire is, to make an actor who is endowed with particular talents, laugh before his audience at a reigning eccentricity, and
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
not, as formerly, personate the character to which it is peculiar; and in which an eternal repitition of some contemptible vulgarity, is to supply the places of wit and brilliancy: yet, their existence, we must hope, is eminently precarious; for should a tolerable taste ever again favour a British audi∣ence, posterity shall with difficulty credit, that such plays were <HI>heard,</HI> and, with still greater difficulty, that they were applauded.</P>

He has also been honoured with the intimate friendship of Mr. Gar∣rick, Sir Francis Blake Delaval, and Mr. Foote. Mr. Murphy was warmly engaged, at the com∣mencement of the present reign, in the party of the
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
Earl of Bute, and was, upon that account, exposed to the ridicule of Wilkes and Churchill. Early in life he made an attempt upon the stage, and is severely satirised in the Rosciad, particularly for his ill-success in the character of Othello. As an au∣thor, Mr. Murphy made his first appearance in the Gray's-Inn Journal, a periodical paper, begun in 1752, and which was continued for two years. This paper contains many ingenious essays, which are collected, in two octavo volumes, in the edition of his works, and was the origin of Mr. Murphy's acquaint∣ance with Dr. Johnson. For, being at a friend's house in the country, and not disposed to lose plea∣sure for business, he took up a French <HI>Journal Lite∣raire,</HI> and translating something he liked, sent it to his bookseller. Time discovered that he had translated from the French, a Rambler, which had been taken from the English without acknowledgement; and his subsequent apology to Dr. Johnson, gave birth to a lasting friendship. Mr. Murphy's most numer∣ous pieces, however, are in the dramatic line of composition. He began with producing three farces, in 1756, viz. the Apprentice, the Spouter, and the Englishman from Paris. The last of these pieces was only acted one night, and has never reached the press. He has, since that time, written for the stage, the Upholsterer, a farce; the Orphan of China, a tragedy, translated from Voltaire; the Desert Island, a dramatic tale; the Way to Keep Him, and All in the Wrong, comedies; the Old
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
Maid, and the Citizen, farces; No Man's Enemy but his Own, and the School for Guardians, co∣medies: Zenobia, the Grecian Daughter, and Al∣zuma, tragedies, of which the first is translated from Crebillon; News from Parnassus, a prelude; Know your Own Mind, and the Choice, comedies; and Three Weeks after Marriage, a farce. These pieces were printed separately at the time of their first appearance, and have since been collected in the edition of Mr. Murphy's works, in seven oc∣tavo volumes, published in 1786. They have, many of them, considerable pretensions to merit. The most distinguished are, probably, the Grecian Daughter, and Three Weeks after Marriage; which last, had been most capriciously condemned under its first title, viz. "What we must All Come To." In the above-mentioned edition of his works is also to be found the Rival Sisters, a tragedy, which Mr. Murphy never offered to the stage; and some smal∣ler Poems, a few of which had been published se∣parately. Some elegant Translations from the Eng∣lish, into Latin verse, which are given in this edi∣tion do the highest honour to Mr. Murphy's ta∣lents; among them, the translation of Gray's Elegy is eminently beautiful. The first specimen of his skill at biographical writing was a copious and most entertaining Essay on the Life and Genius of Henry Fielding, prefixed to the edition of that author's works, which was published in 1762. About five years afterward, he published in a duodecimo volume,
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
a most excellent Translation of Marmontel's Belisa∣rius. Neither of these productions are to be found in the seven-volume edition of Mr. Murphy's works. His writings since the publication of that edition have been, "Seventeen Hundred and Ninety-one," a poem, in imitation of the thirteenth Satire of Juvenal, of which Johnson, after giving us his noble imitations of the third and tenth Sa∣tires, said he wished <HI>this</HI> Satire also was done; an Essay on the Life and Genius of Dr. Johnson, pub∣lished in an octavo volume, in 1792, and prefixed to Mr. Murphy's edition of Dr. Johnson's Works, in twelve volumes, octavo; and a Translation of the Works of Tacitus, published in 1793, in four quarto volumes.</P>
<P>As the Biographer of Dr. Johnson, we feel little hesitation in giving Mr. Murphy the first place among the many who have aspired to that character. His short Essay is the production of a writer who has duly weighed, and rightly con∣ceived, that judicious uniformity of colouring, which, while it gratifies the reader's curiosity, never fails to hold, in its just light, the object which it represents; and, while we have been disgusted with the im∣pertinent prattle which, by some writers, has been so freely expended upon this virtuous and wise, though partial and austere character, we find, in this Essay, a manliness and propriety of conduct, which can always keep up in our minds an interest in his behalf, without ever forfeiting the dignity of its
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
object. His opinions upon the writings of his au∣thor are highly judicious, and most honourable to his critical talents, and his edition of Dr. John∣son's Works, clearly entitles him to the same place among the Editors of that great character, which we have given him among his biographers. As a Translator of Tacitus, Mr. Murphy will find most favour from those who are most acquainted with the peril of his situation. The celebrated Mr. Gray, in one of his Letters, declares that he found himself, after making an attempt, unequal to the task of giving Tacitus a becoming dress in our language. A better judge than Mr. Gray of such an undertaking, will not easily be found. We are sorry that we can say nothing in praise of Mr. Murphy's laborious work. The freedom of his translation, appears to us, the leading circumstance against his success. But, when we add, that, not∣withstanding every licence of this kind, the English work he has afforded us, is far from an elegant composition; can we say that he has kept any measures with justice, in the execution of his task? The merit, however, of his original writings, will supersede every unfavourable impression of an un∣fortunate attempt, and gain his writings a lasting distinction among the works of taste. It is said that he has been for some time engaged in writing the Life of his friend Foote. Few are so equal to the task of doing justice to the English Aristo∣phanes.</P>

<P>This notorious character was born in 1737, at Thetford in Norfolk. His father was a stay-maker, he was himself brought up to that profession, and exercised it during his youth, at London, Dover, and Sandwich. He afterward turned Exciseman and Grocer, at Lewes in Sussex; and, upon the occasion of an election at Shoreham, in 1771, the poets of Lewes being called upon, by the candi∣date of fairest pretensions, to furnish an election

song, Paine entered the lists, obtained the laurel and was presented with three guineas. This, we believe, was his first public appearance as an au∣thor. in the year following, a design having been formed by the excise officers throughout the king∣dom to apply to Parliament for a consideration of the state of their salaries, he wrote <HI>their case,</HI> in an octavo pamphlet of twenty-one pages, which was republished in London a few years ago. Having been discovered, as a grocer to deal in exciseable articles, and as a grinder of snuff to buy smuggled tobacco, he was dismissed from the excise in 1774, after twelve years service. In the mean time, Paine, by his <HI>Case of the Excisemen,</HI> and by his plausibility of manner, had attracted the notice of the late Mr. George Lewis Scott, commissioner of excise. This gentleman recommended him strongly to the cele∣brated Dr. Benjamin Franklin, as a person who could be serviceable, at that time, in America; and Paine set sail for Pennsylvania, in September, 1774, upon a letter of introduction to Governor Franklin of the Jerseys. It was two years after this, that he attracted great notice by the publication of his pamphlet, entitled, "Common Sense." De∣signed as this production was, to ridicule and expose the absurdity of monarchical Government, it proved highly palatable to the republican taste of the United States. It has been called one of those few literary performances, which have been known to produce a great and sudden effect upon the senti∣ments
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
and conduct of a nation; and, having been published at a very critical period, the commence∣ment of the American war, served more than any thing else to induce the inhabitants of that country to an immediate declaration of independence. At the latter end of the same year (1776) he began to publish, in the Pennsylvania Journal, "The Crisis," a periodical essay, which appeared as often, during the continuance of hostilities, as his idea of the state of affairs required. The congress, at first, managed their European concerns by a committee for secret correspondence, but their demands for European aid becoming more urgent, the Secret Committee was converted into a Committee for Foreign Affairs. Paine, who was now becoming a celebrated character in the United States, was ap∣pointed Secretary to this Committee, but being de∣tected in retailing through the newspapers what he confidentially knew from the foreign correspond∣ence, he was forced to resign that office. Soon after this, he obtained the degree of M. A. from the University of Pennsylvania, was chosen a Member of the American Philosophical Society; and, when the Congress had rejected him as unworthy of trust, the Assembly of Pennsylvania, which had been purged of Quakers by his pen, thought him fit for its Clerk. In 1782, he printed at Philadelphia, a Letter to the Abbé Raynal on the Affairs of North America, in which he undertook to correct and clear up the mis∣takes in the Abbé's Account of the Revolution. A
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
little later in the same year, and at the same place, he also printed, a Letter to the Earl of Shelburne, on his Speech in Parliament, July 10th, 1782, in which the noble Earl had said, that, <Q>When Great Bri∣tain shall acknowledge American Independence, the sun of Britain's glory is set for ever.</Q> Both of these Letters were, shortly afterward, reprinted in London. In the Autumn of 1786, Paine left America, with the intention of going to France, and arrived at Paris early in 1787, having left no great share of popularity behind him. His stay here was short, and he reached London in the Au∣tumn of the same year. Before the conclusion of 1787, he published a pamphlet upon the recent transactions between Great Britain and Holland, entitled, "Prospects on the Rubicon," in which he censured the measures of the English Administra∣tion.</P>
<P>We come now to that period in Paine's History, when his speculations were to shake the fabric of the public mind to its very foundation, and his writings to infuse a poison among a deluded com∣monalty, the effects of which, to a philosopher in the shade, would have been scarcely credible. Being released, in November, 1789, from a sponging∣house, into which a debt, contracted by the pro∣ject of erecting an Iron Bridge, had brought him; he beheld, with delight, the proceedings of that memorable year in France, and hastened to that country. Soon, however, he recrossed the channel,
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
and, in his road to London, encountered Mr. Burke's far-famed pamphlet, which appeared a few days before the celebration of the French Revolu∣tion, November 5th, 1790. A few months la∣bour produced Part I. of the "Rights of Man." It was submitted to the revisal of Mr. Brand Hollis and a democratic Committee; and, after some struggles, between the desires of the author and the wishes of his patrons, was committed by them to the press. In February 1791, it was printed for Johnson, in St. Paul's Church Yard, but his re∣gard for <HI>the credit of his shop,</HI> induced him to de∣cline the sale, and a delay of a month in the pub∣lication thus took place. A few copies were, how∣ever, smuggled into private hands, and, at length, on the 13th of March, 1791, it was published by Jordan, in Fleet Street, with a Dedication to Ge∣neral Washington. The apprehensions of Paine, upon this occasion, seem to have been very great. Always ready to take wing for France, he fluttered with anxiety about the Metropolis. At length, finding that the Ministry, trusting to the good sense of the people, gave itself no concern about him, he took a lodging in Fetter Lane, (where he re∣mained till his final departure) and immediately went to work at Part II. of the "Rights of Man." This was published by Jordan, early in 1792. It is well known that the Jacobin Societies took the utmost pains to distribute cheap editions of this work, over the whole nation, particularly in ma∣nufactories,
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
and among the labouring poor. It is even said, that tobacco, grocery, and sweet-meats for children, were frequently sold in wrappers of its sheets! Many Answers to the two Parts were pro∣duced at the press, and at the anniversary meeting of the Constitutional Society, on the 13th of April, 1792, the Members of these Jacobin Societies were stated to exceed forty thousand persons! Go∣vernment, at length, became alarmed. Prosecu∣tions were commemced, in May, 1792, against Paine, as the author, and Jordan as the publisher of "Rights of Man." The royal proclamation was issued, stating that seditious writings had been industriously dispersed for inciting discontent, and warning all magistrates to be diligent in suppres∣sing tumult and preserving quiet. Both Houses of Parliament declared their abhorrence of writings, which had anarchy for their end, and proclaimed their unalterable resolution to maintain the autho∣rity of the laws. The City of London avowed her loyalty to the King, and her attachment to the constitution. The other corporations followed the example of the metropolis; and the county-meet∣ings joined in the general abhorrence of innovation, and in the universal determination to support the wise system of policy, which had been transmitted by the wisdom of their ancestors. Paine was now employed in writing those Letters for the ARGUS, which were afterward distributed from the pam∣phlet-shops under the title of "Paine's four Letters
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
on Government." Shortly afterward, he produced a pamphlet, consisting of two Letters to Lord On∣slow, and one to Mr. Dundas; and another pam∣phlet, containing, "A Letter to the Addressers on the late Proclamation," the great object of which was, to procure a National Convention in contempt of the Parliament. He was, at the same time, readily adopted as a proper citizen, by a country which had recently plunged into the depths of anarchy; and, when the Jacobin Clubs were about to form a Convention at Paris of turbulent spirits from every quarter of the world, several de∣partments contended for the honour of being re∣presented by the celebrated Thomas Paine. Ca∣lais bore away the <HI>glorious</HI> prize from all her competi∣tors, and she sent citizen Audibert to signify his ap∣pointment, and to solicit his acceptance of it. He required little solicitation; and quitting London on the 13th of September, 1792, was received with open arms on the following day, on the shores of Calais. He was tried by a special jury at Guildhall, and convicted as a malignant libeller; and, soon afterward, his effigy and his books were burned in almost every village in England. His conviction made him an outlaw, and, having joined the Con∣vention at Paris, in a declaration of war against Great Britain, he has, since that time, become a traitor. Amid the changes of Government in France, Paine did not escape notice, and when Robespierre began to gain an ascendancy, he was
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
sent, with Anacharsis Cloots, to the prison at Lux∣emburg. He, however, escaped the Guillotine, and during his confinement, composed his work, entitled, "The Age of Reason," Part I. of which was published in London, in 1794, and Part II. in the year following. This work naturally produced several Answers at the press, among which the "Apology for the Bible," by the Bishop of Lan∣daff, is to be most eminently distinguished. Paine's subsequent writings have been, a Dissertation on the first Principles of Government; "The De∣cline and Fall of the English System of Finance;" a most impudent Letter to General Washington; and "Agrarian Justice opposed to Agrarian Law and to Agrarian Monopoly," all pamphlets.</P>
<P>The abuse which has been so liberally bestowed upon Paine, as a writer, has, perhaps, for the most part, been the result of a zeal whose tendency is to weaken, more than to support, its cause. Let us ra∣ther allow him, the qualified credit of an animated, energetic writer, who displays considerable acute∣ness but whose manner of thinking is rude, wicked and daring, and whose language is vulgar though impressive. Let us rather rejoice, that Englishmen, with their just veneration for civil liberty and the rights of the people, were found so wise and sted∣fast in an hour of danger, as to despise those sorry calculators, that would persuade a country, whose constitution has raised her to be the envy of all the civilized world, to hazard that constitution upon
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
the grossest, clumsiest, and stalest theories. Let us be thankful that the Arch-theorist of the Rights of Man, of those rights which transfer the reins from his passion to his reason, of those rights which dissolve ties, which confound distinctions, which destroy security, could play upon us with his new lights upon human governments, without dazzling our reason, or impairing our eye-sight. Finally let us rejoice, that when this wily and audacious Anarch dared, at last, to attack the sacred volume of our Reli∣gion, there was found, on our bench of Bishops a learned and philosophical Prelate, condescending enough and active enough to oppose them nobly and completely, by his erudition, his clearness, and his strength of argument.</P>

He was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, took his degree of Batchelor of Arts, with great distinction, in 1763, and afterward, became tutor of the above society. His works have experienced that brilliant success to which their very extraordinary value entitles them. The first of them (excepting single Sermons) was his highly celebrated "Prin∣ciples of Moral and Political Philosophy," which
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
was first published in a quarto volume, in 1785, and has since been very frequently reprinted, with cor∣rections and improvements, in two octavo volumes. It is hardly possible to say too much in favour of this treatise. The ripest schoolman may read it with instruction and delight, while it contains amuse∣ment for the most volatile fancy. It has obtained its author one distinction among others, singularly glorious, and, most probably, unparallelled. We mean the circumstance of its chapters, being very frequently subjects for disputation in the Schools of one of our Universities, at the same time with sections of the immortal Principia of Newton, or with chapters of the celebrated Essay of Locke. Thus the distinguished honours which such tran∣scendent characters are proud to receive after death, are conferred on Dr. Paley while alive! The style of this work is admirably adapted to its subject, and is, perhaps, one of the best models for the imitation of youth, which can be found in our language; while the fine reasoning, the pertinency of illustration, the strong integrity of judgement, and the great comprehension of mind which per∣vade it, may be fit objects of its emulation, provided it duly estimate the labour of thought, and application necessary to such acquisitions, and form not, after all, too sanguine hopes of reaching such perfection. Some Remarks upon this work have been written by Mr. Gisborne, for an account of which, we refer the reader to our memoir of
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
that gentleman. Beside this production. Dr. Paley has published several single Sermons, preached on particular occasions and before the University of Cambridge; "Horae Paulinae; or, the Truth of the Scripture History of St. Paul evinced, by a Comparison of the Epistles which bear his Name, with the Acts of the Apostles, and with one ano∣ther," published in an octavo volume, in 1790; and "A View of the Evidences of Christianity," in three volumes, octavo, published in 1794. All these productions are worthy of the celebrated au∣thor of "Principles of Moral and Political Philo∣sophy." The last of them, in particular, has ex∣perienced a most distinguished reception. It bears in every page, the strongest characteristic touches of its able and excellent writer. It is the most com∣plete summary of the evidences of Christianity, that has ever appeared. It is a work most essen∣tial and useful to his fellow-creatures, and must be acceptable in the sight of his God.</P>

<P>Late Fellow and Tutor of Christ's College, Cambridge. This gentleman was a cotemporary at the University with the celebrated mathematician, Mr. Atwood. They both took their degrees of B. A. in 1769, and to Mr. Parkinson was adjudged the superiority in mathematical knowledge. The world, however, from the specimens which each of these gentlemen have given it, as writers on subjects of science, will be disposed to wonder at this decision. Dr. Parkinson published, in 1789, in a quarto volume, a System of Mechanics and Hydrostatics, the substance of his lectures as a pub∣lic tutor. Of this work we do not scruple to de∣clare that it is one of the clumsiest which has ever come from the hands of an able proficient in natural philosophy, who has attempted to facilitate the progress of the Student, by a selection from the works of others▪ It is a disgraceful specimen of

<HEAD>PARR, REV. SAMUEL, L.L.D.</HEAD>
<P>A most elegant and profound Scholar, very highly celebrated for his knowledge of the Greek language. He was originally one of the under∣masters of Harrow School, and in that situation had the honour of sharing in the education, among others, of Mr. Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Upon a vacancy in the headmastership, in 1770, Dr. Parr became a candidate for that office, and his cause was so warmly, espoused by many of the boys of the school, as to occasion very turbulent proceed∣ings. Proving unsuccessful, he retired to a village at a small distance from Harrow, and opened a
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
school, to which he was followed by many of the Harrow scholars. Dr. Parr was afterward ap∣pointed, by the Earl of Dartmouth, to superintend the education of his eldest son, Lord Viscount Lewisham, in consequence of which he resigned his school, and fixed his residence at Colchester, where he was attended by his Lordship, and one or two more pupils. At the expiration of this engage∣ment, he was chosen Master of the Free School at Norwich, which he conducted with great repu∣tation, and has now been settled, for some years, in the neighbourhood of Warwick, in the occupa∣tion of educating private pupils.</P>
<P>Dr. Parr's first publications were, Sermons preached at Norwich during the American war. Of these, two appeared with his name in 1780, and a third, a Fast Sermon, under the name <HI>Phileleuthe∣rus Norfolciensis,</HI> in the year following. The last of these is particularly excellent. In 1786, he pub∣lished a fourth Sermon, preached for the benefit of the Charity Schools in Norwich. It was in the year following this, that he published a new edition, in an octavo volume, of the three Books <HI>De Statu</HI> of Bellendenus, (Master of the Pleas to James I.) and prefixed a most elegant Preface. Few pieces of composition in Latin, have been more admired than this masterly preface. It was reprinted, separately, in the year following its first publication. It con∣sists chiefly of a political retrospect of the internal transactions of Britain, since the year 1783, and
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
presents us an animated panegyric of Lord North, Mr. Burke, and Mr. Fox, with a glowing invective against the methods employed to deprive them of the share they held in the Government of their country. The Latin, as well as the English style of Dr. Parr, is always strong, manly, and beautiful, but, perhaps, it possesses, upon the whole, less of grace and elegance than of energy. In 1789, Dr. Parr published "Tracts by Warburton and a War∣burtonian, not admitted into the Collection of their respective Works," in an octavo volume. Almost every reader will condemn the poignancy of lan∣guage, which is used in the preface to this volume, against the venerable Bishop of Worcester, while he will confess, with pleasure, that the characters of Jortin, Leland, and Warburton are amply and beautifully delineated. In the year 1792, Dr. Parr published an octavo pamphlet, entitled, "A Sequel to the printed Paper <HI>lately</HI> circulated in Warwick∣shire, by the Rev. Charles Curtis, brother of Alder∣man Curtis, a Birmingham Rector, &amp;c." which reached a second edition. This was occasioned by a suspicion, that Mr. Curtis had written certain ano∣nymous Letters, which were sent to the Doctor; that he had uttered certain reflections upon him, in his pulpit discourses; and that he had sent the <HI>printed paper,</HI> which appeared <HI>(auctior et emendatior)</HI> in an evening Newspaper. The same year pro∣duced Dr. Parr's celebrated and excellent Letter from Irenopolis to the Inhabitants of Eleutheropolis,
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
which is a serious address to the dissenters of Birm∣ingham, written, in consequence of a report that they intended a second commemoration of the French Revolution, and was published in a shilling pamphlet. For an account of Dr. Parr's literary association with the late Mr. Homer and Dr. Combe, relative to the publication of an Edition of Horace, we refer the reader to our memoir of the last-mentioned gentleman; where he will also see the occasion which produced Dr. Parr's excellent pamphlet, entitled, "Remarks on the Statement of Dr. Charles Combe, by <HI>an occasional Writer in the British Critic."</HI></P>
<P>It may very reasonably be questioned whether the services which Dr. Parr has done to the world have been adequate to his ability, or his knowledge. Much is to be allowed, however, for that want of leisure and opportunity which every man of letters must feel, whole constant and necessary occupation is the instruction of youth. To the character of a profound scholar, though the printed testimonies he has afforded us may have been slender, none shall dare to dispute his claim; and were our re∣maining possessions of Greek and Latin authors to share the fate of the celebrated Alexandrian Li∣brary, we believe, that this gigantic proficient could afford us, from recollection, a very tolerable idea of Grecian and Roman literature. Of the English style of Dr. Parr it has been said, that it unites the strength of Johnson with the richness of Burke.</P>

<HEAD>PENNANT, THOMAS, ESQ. F.R.S.</HEAD>
<P>Member of many foreign Societies, and a most ingenious and celebrated Naturalist and Antiqua∣rian. He was born at Downing in Flintshire, in 1726, received the earlier part of his education at Wrexham School, was afterward removed to a school at Fulham, then kept by Mr. Croft, and, after being a Member of Queen's and Oriel Col∣leges, Oxford, assumed the law gown. A present or Willoughby's Ornithology, made to him at the age of twelve years, first gave him a taste for the study of Natural History. Of Mr. Pennant's first work, his celebrated British Zoology, the first part made its appearance on the 1st of March, 1763, in Imperial folio. It was carried on at the expence of a Society of ancient Britons (the Cymmrodo∣rions) for the benefit of a Welch charity-school, in London, and was completed in 1766. This work was next published in four volumes, octavo, of which the two first made their appearance in 1768; and it has since been also reprinted in quarto. Mr. Pennant's subsequent publications have been, Indian Zoology, formed from a fine collection of drawings of animals brought over by J. G. Loten, Esq. a former Governor in Ceylon, of which a small part was first published, in folio, in 1769, and which, a few years ago, was published with

Beside these produc∣tions, Mr. Pennant had, at this time written, the

Natural History of the Turkey, and an Account of Earthquakes felt in Flintshire, in the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1781; as also "Miscella∣nies," of which only thirty copies were printed, at the press of George Allan, Esq. of Darlington.</P>
<P>In the year 1790, Mr. Pennant determined to desist from his literary labours, and Signified his in∣tention, in a prefatory paragraph to his Account of London. Two years afterward, however, he published a Letter to a Member of Parliament, on Mail Coaches, and has also written "The Lite∣rary Life of <HI>the late</HI> Thomas Pennant, Esq." pub∣lished in a thin quarto volume, in 1793; and a His∣tory of the Parishes of Whiteford and Holywell, published in a quarto volume, in 1796.

<HEAD>PERFECT, WILLIAM, ESQ. M.D.</HEAD>
<P>A Surgeon of West Malling in Kent, Member of the London Medical Society, and Provincial Grand Master of Masons for the county of Kent. This gentleman was born at Oxford, in 1740, and is son of the Rev. William Perfect, formerly Vicar of East Mailing in Kent. He is celebrated for his skill in the cure of persons afflicted with insanity, and for his activity as a member of the brotherhood of Free and Accepted Masons. Dr. Perfect com∣municated several articles to the Medical Museum; among them are. "An Attempt to improve Medi∣cal Prognostication;" "The Case of a Catalepsy;" and "The Appearances on dissecting a Woman who died of eating too much Cucumber." In 1778, he published "Methods of Cure in some particular Cases of Insanity," an octavo pamphlet; and, in 1781, Vol. I. (in octavo) of "Cases in Midwifery," to which Vol. II. was, soon afterward, added. The last mentioned work was founded on the literary correspondence of the late learned and ingenious Dr. Colin Mackenzie, and contains the only traits of his practice which have, hitherto, been submitted to the public eye. In 1784, Dr. Perfect published an Address to the Public on the Subject of Insanity, notifying that he had opened houses at West Malling for the reception of insane per∣sons;
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
and, three years afterward, he produced an octavo volume of select Cases in the different Spe∣cies of Insanity, Lunacy, or Madness, with the Modes of Practice as adopted in the Treatment of each. Since that time, Dr. Perfect's only produc∣tion, in this class of publications, has been a pam∣phlet, entitled, "A remarkable Case of Madness, with the Diet and Medicines used in the Cure." This remarkable case is a boy at the age of <HI>eleven,</HI> and the cure is an additional proof of the author's skill, in the treatment of confirmed mania.</P>
<P>Dr. Perfect is also a Versifier, as well as a writer on medical subjects. He published, so early as the year 1763, "A Bavin of Bays," in a duodecimo volume; and has also written "The Laurel Wreath," in two duodecimo volumes; an Elegy on the great Storm in 1773, which was a good deal read; the Snowy Day, a pastoral sketch; and "Poetical Effusions," published in 1796.

<HEAD>PINKERTON, JOHN, F.S.A. PERTH.</HEAD>
<P>A native of Scotland. His first publication was an octavo volume, in 1781, which he entitled, <HI>Rimes.</HI> Being of opinion that uniformity of stanza, when protracted to any degree, must ever fatigue, as extinguishing the great source of all pleasure, variety, he here adopted a series of stanzas, in which, as in the Greek strophe, antistrophe, and epode, the two first correspond, and are succeeded by a third of a different measure. But the speci∣men with which Mr. Pinkerton here presented the public, was by no means peculiarly engaging. In the year following he published, "Tales in Verse," in a quarto pamphlet; and also two dithyrambic Odes; which are more distinguished by harshness and affected singularity, than by any species of ex∣cellence. Mr. Pinkerton's next publication was a useful Essay on Medals, which first appeared, ano¦nymously, in a single octavo volume, in 1784, and was enlarged to two volumes in the second edition. The valuable assistance of Dr. Combe and Mr, Southgate, we believe, were afforded the author upon this occasion. In 1786, Mr. Pinkerton pub∣lished, "Ancient Scotish Poems, never before in
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
Print," in two crown-octavo volumes; and, in the year following, a Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths, in an octavo volume. His subsequent publications have been, an Enquiry into the History of Scotland, preceeding the Reign of Malcolm III. in two octavo volumes, published in 1789; the first genuine edition of Barbour's Bruce, with notes and a glossary, in three volumes, duodecimo, published in 1790; Scotish Poems, reprinted from scarce editions, in three octavo volumes, published in 1792; <HI>Iconogra∣phia Scotica</HI>; or, Portraits of illustrious Persons of Scotland, with short Biographical Notices, Part I. II. III. IV; and the History of Scotland from the Accession of the House of Stuart to that of Mary, with Appendixes of original Papers, in two vo∣lumes, quarto, published in 1797. In the last of these works, Mr. Pinkerton has judiciously chosen the period of Scotish History which remained insu∣lated between the accurate investigation of the ear∣lier age, by Sir David Dalrymple, and the elegant History of the later times, by Dr. Robertson. He has produced a work of great merit, and, should it experience the favourable reception to which we think it entitled, it is his design to write, upon the same plan, the History of Scotland from the ear∣liest Accounts to the Accession of the House of Stuart. Upon the whole, our opinion of Mr. Pin∣kerton as a writer is, that, notwithstanding an oc∣casional unpleasant appearance of vanity, pedantry,

causticity, and want of taste, he is possessed of real and extensive knowledge, much good sense, and sufficient originality. We think he is somewhat amenable on the score of Book-making,</P>

<HEAD>PIOZZI, HESTHER LYNCH.</HEAD>
<P>A Lady of considerable notoriety in the literary world. She is the daughter of John Salisbury Esq. formerly of Bach-y-graig, in the county of Flint, and neice to Sir Thomas Salisbury, who rose to con∣siderable eminence as a civilian, in Doctor's Com∣mons. In 1763, she married the late Henry Thrale Esq.; a distinguished Brewer in the borough of Southwark. This excellent man, in the year fol∣lowing his marriage, was introduced, by Mr. Mur∣phy, to the acquaintance of Dr. Samuel Johnson. The intimacy of that celebrated character with this family daily increased, and he soon became an almost constant inmate of their country residence at Streatham. The conduct of Mr. Thrale to Dr. Johnson, was indeed truly praise-worthy. His family contributed, for fifteen years, to the prolong∣ation and comfort of a most valuable life, and when the benevolent master sunk into the grave, the me∣mory of his kindness was acknowledged by the loving object of his regard, with the confession that with him were buried many of his hopes and pleasures, that the face upon which he had looked for the last
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
time, had never been turned upon him but with respect and benignity, that he obtained from him many opportunities of amusement, and turned his thoughts to him as to a refuge from misfortunes. Upon the death of Mr. Thrale, his widow finding it (as she asserts) extremely perplexing and diffi∣cult to live in the same house with the Doctor, took advantage of a lost law-suit to plead inability of purse for remaining longer in London or its vicinity, and retired to Bath, where she knew he would not follow her. She continued, however, to corre∣spond with Dr. Johnson, till near the time (July 1784) of her marriage to her second husband, Sig∣nior Piozzi, a native of Florence, and a music-master of the City of Bath; when a very warm expostulation, on the part of the Doctor, against this step, dissolved their friendship. Soon after her union with Mr. Piozzi, she travelled with him to the place of his birth, and visited several parts of Europe before they returned to England.</P>
<P>During her residence in Florence, in 1785, chance having brought together, at that place, a few English of both sexes, particularly Mr. Merry, Mr. Parsons, and Mr. Greathead, they wrote, in association, "The Florence Miscellany," a collection of pieces in prose and verse, of which a few copies have been printed, but it has not been published. Some specimens of this flighty production appeared in a newspaper of the day, called the World, as well as in several of the magazines: the preface
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
was written by Mrs. Piozzi, to whom, we believe, the conduct of the work had been committed. Se∣veral other fugitive poetical pieces by Mrs. Piozzi, as, the Three Warnings, a tale imitated from La Fontaine; a Translation of Boileau's Epistle to his Gardener, (first printed in Mrs. Williams' Miscel∣lanies); and a Prologue to the Royal Suppliants, have reached the public eye. Among these, the first is to be particularly distinguished as a very masterly production, and it has been strongly sus∣pected that Dr. Johnson either wrote it, or assisted in the composition of it. The former opinion, we think, from the style of the piece, is improbable; but that it has felt his correcting hand, we have little doubt.</P>
<P>The first regular exploit of Mrs. Piozzi in au∣thorship, was made in the year 1786; when she produced her crown-octavo volume of Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson. Two years after this, she pub∣lished a Collection of Letters to and from Dr. Johnson, from 1765, to 1784, in two octavo vo∣lumes. Her "Anecdotes," as coming from the pen of a writer who had long shared the society and friendship of that illustrious character, were perused with great avidity; but time has dissolved the charm. They bring us acquainted, it is true, with the domestic transactions, and introduce us to the private hours of the object held up to our view; yet, what of this, when, as admirers of the learning and moral excellence of their hero, we glow at
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
almost every page with indignation, that his weak∣nesses and his failings should be disclosed to public view? There is, surely, something sacred attached in every well-constituted mind to the memory of a character, which, beside extorting from us a tribute of admiration by its public name, has mingled its so∣cial intercourse with our private lives, has confirmed and instructed us by its example and its precepts, and displayed to us, upon a nearer view, a propor∣tional degree of that excellence which same had con∣ceded as its due. To a mind of this make, the stamp of death would enliven the impressions it had re∣ceived, and, creating a melancholy and awful ve∣neration for the departed object of its regard, for∣get its failings, amid its pious fondness for the pleasing remembrance of its worth. The name of Johnson shall live while Piety, while Virtue, while Learning are regarded: yet Johnson, after the lustre he had reflected on the name of Thrale, after the delight which his counsel and his friendship had, for many years, afforded to the family, aged and infirm, was to be deserted by his only surviving companion and his nurse a year or two before his end; and after death, to have his memory tortured and abused by her detested itch for scribbling. More injury, we will venture to affirm, has been done to the same of Johnson, by this lady and her late biographical helpmate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boswell.</NOTE> than his most avowed
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
enemies have ever been able to effect; and if his character becomes unpopular with some of his suc∣cessors, it is to these gossiping friends he is indebted for the favour.</P>
<P>In 1789, Mrs Piozzi published, "Observations and Reflections made in the Course of a Journey through France, Italy, and Germany," in two oc∣tavo volumes; and, in 1794, "British Synonymy; or, an Attempt at regulating the Choice of Words in familiar Conversation," in two octavo volumes. The former of these works is entertaining, though, in many respect, very reprehensible. To the due execution of the latter, a rare combination of ta∣lents was requisite, among the least of which may be numbered neatness of style, acuteness of per∣ception, and a more than common accuracy of dis∣crimination. This lady, on the contrary, brought to the task a jargon, long since become proverbial for its vulgarity, an incapability of defining a single term in the language, and just so much Latin, from a child's syntax, as sufficed to expose the ignorance she so anxiously labours to conceal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Preface to Baviad.</NOTE></P>
<P>The general character, which we are disposed to afford Mrs. Piozzi, as an author, is, that she is possessed of respectable talents, and of an educa∣tion superior to what commonly falls to the lot of the fair sex; but that her vanity is so conspi∣cuous upon every occasion, as to destroy, in most
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
minds, any favourable impression which her abili∣ties, or her attainments might make. Little in∣deed, do the lessons and example of her austere preceptor appear to have contributed toward mak∣ing her more solid or more judicious!</P>

<HEAD>POLWHELE, REV. RICHARD.</HEAD>
<P>Of Polwhele in Cornwall. A respectable di∣vine, a very pleasing poet, but a less successful historian. He was born in 1760, at his above∣mentioned patrimonial estate, was educated at the neighbouring grammar-school of Truro, became a member of Christ-Church College, Oxford, was admitted a student in civil law, afterward took or∣ders, and was, for ten years, curate of Kenton near Exeter. Before Mr. Polwhele left Truro-school, he wrote and published the Fate of Lew∣ellyn, a legendary tale; the Genius of Karnbre, a poem; the Spirit of Fraser to General Burgoyne, an ode; the Death of Hilda, an American tale; an Ode to Mrs. Macaulay, on her Birth-day; the Castle of Tintadgel, an ode; and the Isle of Pop∣lars, an ode: the two last of which were published among Rack's Essays. It is curious that the versi∣fication of his first production, "The Fate of Lewellyn," is much more melodious than that of his "English Orator," which is nearly the last; but the Tale was written to please the ear only. In 1785, Mr. Polwhele published, anonymously, Book I▪ of "The Art of Eloquence," a didactic poem; and also, "Pictures from Nature, in twelve Son∣nets," each quarto pamphlets. The first of these was reprinted in the following year, under the title
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
of "The English Orator," and three more books were afterward added. In the year 1786, Mr. Polwhele also published a Translation into English verse, with dissertations and notes, of the Idyllia, Epigrams, and Fragments of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus, with the Elegies of Tyrtaeus, in a quarto volume, which was afterward reprinted in two oc∣tavos. It is said of this work that it was com∣pleted in half a year: if so, it does great credit to the talents of the writer, since many of the transla∣tions are extremely happy, and, considered as a whole, it is, perhaps, a formidable rival of the si∣milar production by Mr. Fawkes. In 1789, Mr. Polwhele published, two octavo volumes of well-written Discourses on different Subjects; and has, since that time, produced a quarto volume of "Poems," containing his "English Orator," his "Sonnets," and some other pieces; a single Ser∣mon, preached in 1792, at Kenton; Vol. I. of Historical Views of Devonshire, in octavo; and Vol. II. of the History of Devonshire, in folio. The <HI>former</HI> of the two last-mentioned works is to be completed in five volumes: it is a repository of cu∣rious notices, not interfering with the author's main undertaking: the <HI>latter</HI> of them, which is to be comprehended in three volumes, and the publi∣cation of which was commenced with the second volume, in 1793. Beside these productions, Mr. Polwhele wrote the Biographical Memoirs of Mr. Rack, in Collinson's History of Somerset, and was

<HEAD>POPE, REV. JOHN.</HEAD>
<P>This gentleman was the successor of Mr. Gil∣bert Wakefield, as tutor in Belles-Lettres and Classical Literature, at the New-College, Hackney, and has made himself appear ridiculous enough, by attempting to bring his sprinkling of classical knowledge, in competition with the copious waters of that celebrated and excellent scholar. He pub∣lished, in 1792, a duodecimo volume, entitled, "Observations on the miraculous Conception," &amp;c. with Remarks on Mr. Wakefield's opinion concerning Mat. xxvii. 5; and also an octavo vo∣lume, entitled, "Divine Worship founded in Na∣ture, and supported by Scripture Authority," with Remarks on Mr. Wakefield's arguments against Public Worship, and strictures on some parts of his Silva Critica, and English Version of the New Tes∣tament. Previous to these publications, we believe, he had printed a single Sermon: since their ap∣pearance he has published, two Sermons, in an oc∣tavo pamphlet. The writings of Mr. Pope are, by no means, destitute of ingenuity or liberality;

<HEAD>PORSON, RICHARD, ESQ. M.A.</HEAD>
<P>Greek Professor in the University of Cambridge, and formerly Fellow of Trinity College. This gen∣tleman is well known, not in this country only, for his very extraordinary talents, and as the best Greek scholar we have. He was educated at Eton-school, took his degree of B. A. at Cambridge in 1782, was always most eminently distinguished for his classical knowledge, and succeeded Mr. Cooke in the above Professorship, in the year 1793. Mr. Porson's first regular and avowed publication, was his celebrated volume of Letters to Mr. Archdea∣con Travis, in Answer to his Defence of the three Heavenly Witnesses, i. John v. 7, which made its appearance in 1790. Of this work, the celebrated Mr. Gibbon has said, that it is the most
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
acute and accurate piece of criticism which has ap∣peared since the days of Bentley. The author's strictures are founded in argument, enriched with learning, and enlivened with wit; and his adver∣sary neither deserves, nor finds, any quarter at his hands. The elegant edition of the seven Plays of Aeschylus, without notes, without the scholia, and without the fragments, which was published by Foulis at Glasgow, in 1795, in a folio volume, was clandestinely printed from a text corrected by Mr. Porson. That gentleman had lent his manu∣script corrections and conjectures on the text of Aeschylus, to a friend in Scotland, they fell into the hands of Foulis, and the above-mentioned edition was published without the Professor's leave, or even knowledge. Mr. Porson edited the Edition of Heyne's Virgil, which was printed in London; is at present, publishing new editions of Greek Plays, with short commentaries, by single plays, each in an octavo volume, some of which have already made their appearance; and will shortly (we believe produce a new Edition of Aeschylus complete, with Notes. He has also been, for some time, pre∣paring for the Cambridge press, an Edition of the in∣edited Greek Lexicon of Photius, from the manu∣script in Trinity College Library. A most elegant and masterly copy of this work, which his Hercu∣lean talents and exquisite Greek hand-writing had produced, was, not long ago, consumed by an acci∣dental fire, in a house where it was deposited. He
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
has again, however, assailed the mighty undertaking, and will, probably, soon favour the world with the truly desirable fruit of his industry.</P>
<P>It is needless for us to add our eulogium to the well known merit of Mr. Porson, as a philologist, a very consummate scholar, and a most acute and ac∣curate critic. Many occasional fugitive productions, which have either never reached the press, or, if printed, have appeared anonymously, are addi∣tional testimonies to the just estimation in which he is held by the literary world. We have only to lament that he should live below the measure of abilities so transcendent, in contradiction to na∣ture's design in the talents with which she has so liberally endowed him. What is genius (says an elegant writer) without a regulated life! And, surely the paultry occupation of writing for a party journal,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morning Chronicle.</NOTE> and the unmanly indulgence of every excess and dissipation, are most derogatory to a character of first-rate powers and attainments, yea verily beneath a Greek Professor in one of our Universities.</P>

<HEAD>PORTEUS, RT. REV. BEILBY, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>Lord Bishop of London, Dean of the Chapel Royal, &amp;c. This learned and amiable prelate, after having been Rector of Lambeth, and after holding the Bishoprick of Chester for eleven years, succeeded to the See of London, in the year 1787, on the decease of the venerable Dr. Lowth; and is supposed to have risen to his present high rank through the particular patronage of her Majesty. Dr. Porteus was educated at Christ's College, Cam∣bridge, took his degree of B. A. in 1752, obtaining with Baron Maseres, the Chancellor's Medals at that University on their first institution, was, for some time, Fellow of the above Society, and gained the Seatonian Prize for a poetical Essay on Death, in 1759, which was published according to the will of the founder. His Lordship was also for many years, Chaplain to the late Archbishop Secker, and, in association with Dr. Stinton, published the seven octavo volumes of Sermons by that eminent divine, prefixing a Review of his Grace's Life and Cha∣racter. In the year 1776, Dr. Porteus distinguished himself by his exertions to establish a more solemn observation of the Fast, Good-Friday, and pub∣lished,
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
in that year, a serious, affectionate, and sen∣sible "Exhortation," to that effect. This produced a rude ill-natured attack upon his Lordship, from the late Mr. Robert Robinson, of Chesterton near Cambridge, who published the History and Mystery of Good-Friday, in order to ridicule the observance of it. Having, previously, printed several occa∣sional single Sermons, Dr. Porteus published in 1781 "A Brief Confutation of the Errors of the Church of Rome," extracted from Archbishop Secker's five Sermons against Popery, and designed for ge∣neral distribution. Two years after this, he pro∣duced a volume of Sermons on several subjects, to which he added a second volume, in the year 1794. In both of these volumes, many of the occasional single Sermons, which his Lordship had formerly printed were republished, and they are well known to rank among the most perfect examples of pulpit eloquence in our language. Dr. Porteus has also published, a Letter to the Clergy of the Diocese of Chester concerning Sunday Schools, and a Charge delivered to the Clergy of the Diocese of London, at the primary Visitation, in 1790. His Lord∣ship's poetical talents have been handsomely com∣plimented by Hannah More, in her poem, Sensibi∣lity. His style in prose composition is always clas∣sical and correct, but, perhaps, he is too studious of avoiding the blandishments of ornament and fancy. In his episcopal character, he is a pattern of pro∣priety of conduct.</P>

<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
volume of "Poems," most of the pieces in which had before appeared, separately. It con∣tains many very pretty compositions, particularly a beautiful farewell Hymn to the country, in imita∣tion of Spenser. Three years after this, his Tran∣slation of Aeschylus made its appearance in a quarto volume, and has, ever since, been reprinted with the addition of notes, in two volumes, octavo. Of the excellence of this translation, it is hardly possi∣ble to say too much: many of the parts are so ex∣quisitely beautiful as to leave us in doubt whether any poet, we have ever heard of, could have ac∣complished the task with greater success. In 1781, Mr. Potter published, Vol. I. (in quarto) of his Translation of Euripides, to which Vol. II. was added in the year following; and, in 1788, his Translation of Sophocles was published, in a quarto volume. These last-mentioned versions are, cer∣tainly, upon the whole, inferior to Mr. Potter's first production, yet, they are, each of them ex∣cellent performances, and far superior to those of our former translators, Mr. Wodhull and Dr. Frank∣lin. Beside these laborious works, Mr. Potter pub∣lished, in 1783, "An Enquiry into some Passages in Dr. Johnson's Lives of the Poets," a quarto pamphlet; and, in 1785, a Translation of the Ora∣cle concerning Babylon, and the Song of Exulta∣tion from Isaiah, chap. xiii. and xiv.</P>

Mr. Courtney, soon afterward, published Observations on Young's

Mr. Pratt's next produc∣tions were, "The Triumph of Benevolence," a poem, occasioned by the design of erecting a mo∣nument to Mr. Howard; "Humanity," a poem; and an Ode on his Majesty's Recovery; after which his absence on the Continent afforded his pen a long repose. On his return he made, in 1795, an offering of his Muse to his native country, by an Ode to the Benevolence of England; and another to the pockets of his countrymen, by three octavo volumes of "Gleanings," through Wales, Hol∣land, aad Westphalia. Since that time, Mr. Pratt has written a novel, in five duodecimo volumes, en∣titled, "Family Secrets, Literary and Domestic;" and two three-penny Letters, one to the British Soldiers, the other to the Tars of old England.</P>

<HEAD>PRIESTLEY, REV. JOSEPH, L.L.D. F.R.S.</HEAD>
<P>Fellow of many foreign societies, and a dissent∣ing Clergyman, late of Hackney. This celebrated character was born at Field-head near Bristall, about seven miles from Leeds, in the year 1728-9. His father was a merchant and manufacturer: he received the early part of his education from the Rev. Mr. Scott, a dissenting minister in the neigh∣bourhood, and completed it under Mr. Ashworth, near Daventry in Northamptonshire. Dr. Priestley was educated in the strictest principles of calvinism; about the age of twenty he became an Arian, in which persuasion he continued for fifteen or sixteen years; and, at length, embraced the doctrines of Socinus, to which he was chiefly led by Dr. Lard∣ner's Letters on the Logos. He was, for several years, Tutor in the Languages and Belles-Lettres, at the late dissenting academy of Warrington, whence he returned to his native county, and took upon himself the pastoral office at Mill-Hill Cha∣pel, Leeds. In the year 1773, being appointed Chaplain and Librarian to the Marquis of Lans∣down, then Lord Shelburne, he quitted that situa∣tion, and resided with his Lordship for nearly seven years. A coolness taking place between them,
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
and Dr. Priestley having received an invitation to settle with a society of protestant dissenters at Bir∣mingham, he undertook the pastorship of the new meeting of that town, on the last day of the year 1780. Here he long remained undisturbed, al∣though his pulpit Discourses, his political pam∣phlets, and his private conversation were well known to be highly inimical to the Government of his country, and, especially, to her ecclesiastical constitution. But his declamatory vehemence, and the indecency of his conduct to the neighbouring clergy, caused him to be viewed, by the lower classes in Birmingham, as a turbulent, seditious man: and, in July 1791, a flame, which had, for a long time, been gaining strength under suppres∣sion, broke out with dreadful fury upon his devoted head. A most infamous libel had been circulated, which was, of itself, sufficient to inflame the minds of the populace; and the fabrication of this paper was ignorantly attributed to Dr. Priestley. At∣tached to the Constitution of their country, they re∣solved to inflict the heaviest vengeance upon the man, who dared thus to insult them: and the con∣sequences were dreadful, indeed. For some days, Birmingham was a miserable scene of popular fury. Houses were pillaged, meeting-houses burned, and no bounds could have been put to the fury of the enraged mob, had it not been for the wise, dispassionate conduct of the neighbouring nobility and gentry, who, at length, succeeded in restoring
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
peace to the distracted town. Dr. Priestley suffered severely. His house, his library, with numerous unpublished manuscripts, his laboratory, and valu∣able philosophical apparatus were all destroyed. Part of the mob, inflamed with liquor, and more savage than the rest, had actually conceived the horrid design of taking away his life: but the pre∣vious intelligence he had received enabled him to elude their vengeance, and they contented them∣selves with burning his effigy. Upon his arrival in London, Dr. Priestley published a Letter, couched in haughty terms, by which he seemed to consider himself as persecuted for righteousness' sake: and, soon afterward, he accepted an invitation to suc∣ceed the late Dr. Price, at the New-College, Hackney. His misfortunes had not, however, cured him of his political frenzy, and his conduct being, at length, marked by Government, a polite intimation was given him to quit the country. Upon this, he emigrated to America, and settled at Northumberland-Town, He was, not long ago, a candidate for the office of Chaplain to the House of Assembly at New York, but had a minority of votes in favour of Dr. Green.</P>
<P>Of the numerous literary productions by Dr. Priestley, the first was a Treatise on the Rudi∣ments of English Grammar, which was published in a duodecimo volume, in 1761, and seven years af∣terward, republished with great additions and im∣provements, in an octavo volume. This first work
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
was followed, in 1765, by his useful Charts of Biogra∣phy, and of Universal History, and by an Essay on Liberal Education, in an octavo volume. In 1767, Dr. Priestley published an History of Electricity, in a quarto volume; and a familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity, in a quarto pamphlet; and, in the year following, a Pamphlet on the Lord's Sup∣per; a small Catechism; and an Essay on the first Principles of Government, in an octavo volume. In 1769, was published Vol. I, (in octavo) of the Theological Repository, consisting of original es∣says, hints, queries, &amp;c. calculated to promote re∣ligious knowledge, a periodical miscellany con∣ducted by Dr. Priestley, and continued to six vo∣lumes. Since that time he has written, in the class of theology, a free Address to Protestant Dis∣senters, on the Doctrines of Calvinism; an Ad∣dress to Masters of Families: Considerations on Church Authority; Considerations on Differences of Opinion among Christians; a View of the Prin∣ciples and Conduct of the Protestant; Dissenters; Additions to his Address on the Lord's Supper; Letters to the Author of Remarks on several Publi∣cations relative to the Dissenters; Answer to a second Letter to him on his Address on the Lord's Supper; Institutes of Natural and Revealed Reli∣gion, in two volumes, octavo; a Farewell Sermon at Leeds; an Address to Protestant Dissenters on giving the Lord's Supper to Children; Considera∣tions for the Use of Young Men; a Free Address

The three last of these were first published in America, and reprinted in London. Collections of his larger and smaller Tracts, have been made in octavo and duodecimo volumes. His publications in other classes, since the above date, have been, Additions to his History of Electricity; the Trial of Elwal, a quaker; Directions for impregnating Water with fixed Air; the History and <HI>present</HI> State of Discoveries relating to Vision, Light, and
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>

sundry times, in Philosophical Transactions of learned societies.</P>
<P>As a Controversialist, no man upon record has been more distinguished than Dr. Priestley. He has been engaged with Mr. Venn, a methodist; with Mr. Berington, a Roman catholic clergyman; with Mr. Whitehead, a quaker; with Dr. Price and Mr. Palmer, dissenting ministers, and Mr. Jacob Bryant, on the subjects of Materialism and Philosophical Necessity; with Bishop Newcome, on the duration of our Lord's Ministry; with Mr. Hammon, a pretended atheist; with Bishop Hors∣ley, Mr. Badcock, Mr. Burn, Mr, Hawkins, the Jews, (particularly Mr. Levi) and the followers of Baron Swedenborg; and, lastly, with Mr. Brian Higgins (in particular) on Natural Philosophy, A short, but curious correspondence between Mr. Gibbon and Dr. Priestley, may also be seen in Lord Sheffield's publication of that gentleman's posthu∣mous Works; in which, though the Historian seems well to understand the <HI>direct tendency</HI> of the Doctor's character and opinions, the temper of the divine appears to much greater advantage than that of his antagonist.</P>
<P>Of the abilities of Dr. Priestley, none can he∣sitate to pronounce that they are of first-rate excell∣ence. His philosophical enquiries and publications claim the greatest distinction, and have materially contributed to the advancement of science. As an experimental philosopher, he is, perhaps, the very
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
first of his age. He has also been a most industri∣ous divine; and, had he proved as diligent in pro∣pagating truth, as in disseminating error, in esta∣blishing the gospel in the minds of men, instead of shaking their belief in the doctrines of revelation, perhaps, few characters of the present century would have ranked higher as learned men, or have been held in greater estimation. On the contrary his political and theological writings must be pro∣nounced to be fraught with principles the most de∣structive to the well-being of society. It was a saying of Dr. Johnson that they were calculated to unsettle every thing, but to settle nothing. The undaunted and unremitting constancy with which he has pursued the establishment of his speculative doctrines, has done infinitely more than was to be wished, toward giving popularity to his metaphysi∣cal and theological sentiments: and, if their appre∣hended effect has fortunately been counteracted, it is, probably, owing to their violence rather than to any other cause. The pillars of revelation, (says Mr. Gibbon) are shaken by those men who pre∣serve the name without the substance of reli∣gion, who indulge the licence without the temper of philosophy!</P>

<HEAD>PYE, HENRY JAMES, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>Poet Laureat, and one of the Magistrates of the Police Office, Queen Square, Westminster. This gentleman is descended from an ancient family in Berkshire, which county his ancestors, as well as
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
himself, have frequently represented in Parliament. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, took his degree of M. A. in 1766, and was after∣ward, for some time, in the Berkshire Militia. On the death of Dr. Warton, in 1790, he succeeded that gentleman as Poet Laureat.</P>
<P>We believe Mr. Pye's first literary production was an Ode on the Birth of the Prince of Wales, printed in the Oxford Collection. He afterward, occasionally, published singly and anonymously, se∣veral original Poems; and also excellent Transla∣tions of the six Olympic Odes of Pindar, omitted by Mr. West; and a Translation of the Art of War, a poem, from the French of the King of Prussia, written in 1778, at his leisure hours during the encampment at Coxheath. In 1783, he pub∣lished, with his name, the Progress of Refinement, a poem; and, four years afterward, "Poems on various Subjects," in two octavo volumes, in which all of the pieces, above referred-to, were collected, and a few new ones added. A very elegant English Translation of the Song of Harmodius and Aristo∣geiton, in which the turn of expression of the ori∣ginal has been imitated with extraordinary felicity, is to be found, among other excellent pieces, in this collection. Mr. Pye's subsequent publications have been, a Translation of the Poetic of Aristotle, first published in an octavo volume, in 1788, and after∣ward prefixed to a Commentary on that work, pub∣lished in a quarto volume; Amusement, a poetical
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
essay, published in 1790; the War Elegies of Tyr∣taeus imitated, and addressed to the People of Great Britain, published in 1795; the Siege of Meaux, a tragedy, acted at Covent Garden Theatre; and Leonore, a tale, translated from the German of Burger. He is also speedily about to present the public with a Poem on the Origin and Progress of Navigation, which, as we have understood, is to close with a splendid apostrophe, commemorating our late glorious naval victories.</P>
<P>The poetry of Mr. Pye cannot, perhaps, upon the whole, be said to be of that very superior kind, which has universally exacted from his readers the applause of first-rate excellence. Yet, none can deny that he is always the elegant scholar, the man of taste and fancy, and the writer of polished ver∣sification; while the great interests of virtue and public spirit-have uniformly been countenanced by his pen. His ARISTOTLE, though a performance of considerable merit, has been displaced by the work, so singularly masterly, of Mr. Twining. Among the several translators of the above-men¦tioned German tale, he is certainly the best.</P>

<HEAD>RADOLIFFE, MRS. ANN.</HEAD>
<P>A LADY of great distinction in the literary world as a Novel-writer. We believe her first production in this class was, "The Castles of Athlin and Dun∣bayne," an highland story, published in a duodecimo volume, in 1789. Since that time, she has written, "A Sicilian Romance," in two duodecimo vo∣lumes; the Romance of the Forest, in three duo∣decimo volumes; the Mysteries of Udolpho, in four duodecimo volumes; and the Italian, in three duodecimo volumes. They have all been very ge∣nerally read and admired, especially, the Romance of the Forest, and the Mysteries of Udolpho. Her powers of pleasing, in this line of composition, are very singularly great; and the happy combination of various talents which her pieces display, entitles their author to rank among the first novel-writers of her age; while the beautiful verses interspersed among her tales, must raise her highly in the estima∣tion of every poetical genius.

<HEAD>REEVE, MRS. CLARA.</HEAD>
<P>A literary lady of much ingenuity, resident at Ipswich in Suffolk.

She next wrote the Champion of Virtue, a Gothic story, which was published in 1777; and was republished in the following year, under the title it has ever since retained, viz. "The Old English Baron." Mrs. Reeve has, since that time, written the two Mentors, a modern story; "The Progress of Romance through Times, Countries, and Manners," in a course of interesting and well-writ∣ten evening conversations; The Exile, or Memoirs of the Count de Cronstadt, the principal incidents

<P>Late Professor of Moral Philosophy in the Uni∣versity of Glasgow. He was the most scientific and distinguished of the three <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reid, Beattie, and Oswald.

It was an octavo volume, published in 1764, and entitled, "An Enquiry into the Human Mind, on the Prin∣ciples of Common Sense." The great object of this volume was, to refute certain principles with regard to the human understanding, which had, for a long time, been commonly adopted by philo∣sophers, and, upon which, Bishop Berkeley and Mr. Hume had, at last, erected a system of scep∣ticism. It was received with a degree of favour, seldom shewn to metaphysical disquisitions. In the year 1785, Dr. Reid published, "Essays on the In∣tellectual Powers of Man," in a quarto volume. This treatise is written upon a much more extensive plan than the former, and comprehends an account of all the powers of the human understanding. A few years afterward, in continuation of his general plan, and, in completion of the analysis, which he proposed to make of the human mind, Dr. Reid

<P>A gentleman of very extensive and very accu∣rate knowledge.

This map was first published in 1783, accompanied by a "Memoir," in a quarto volume, consisting of illustrations of Indian Geo∣graphy. Five years afterward the Memoir was re∣published, in a thicker volume, with great im∣provements. Major Rennell has written, since that time, "The Marches of the British Armies in the Peninsula of India, during the Campaigns of 1790 and 1791, illustrated and explained by reference to a Map, compiled from authentic Documents, transmitted by Earl Cornwallis from India," pub∣lished in 1792, in an octavo volume; Memoir of a Map of the Peninsula of India, from the latest au∣thorities, published the year following, in a quarto volume; and Observations on a Current that often prevails to the Westward of Sicily, a quarto pam∣phlet. To the third edition of Major Rennell's first-méntioned Memoir, published in 1793, was added the second supplementary map, containing the new geography of the Peninsula of India, and also the explanatory memoir. It is hardly ne∣cessary for us to add that this gentleman ranks

<HEAD>ROBERTS, WILLIAM, ESQ. A.M. F.A.S.</HEAD>
<P>Of Gray's Inn. A gentleman whose literary attainments are of very singular distinction and ex∣cellence. He is the younger son of the subject of the preceeding article, was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, became a Fellow of that society, and was originally destined to the church, which he afterward relinquished in favour of the law. While at the University, he obtained, about the year 1788, a prize for an Essay on Refinement, which is one of the most masterly and elegant per∣formances we almost ever recollect to have seen. A few copies only of it were printed for the sake of pri∣vate distribution. Mr. Roberts was also, about that time, a frequent contributor to the English Review, which was then certainly the best-conducted literary journal of the day; and, we believe, he also pub∣lished, at the University, an Account of the Ox∣ford Marbles, in a duodecimo volume. On leaving College, he travelled, for a short time, on the con∣tinent; and, soon after his return, commenced the publication of his excellent periodical paper, "The Looker-on." No. I. made its appearance, (in fo∣lio) March 10th, 1792, the first twenty-five num∣bers were published on Tuesdays and Saturdays,
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
then, after an interval of a few months, it was continued on Saturdays only, and the last number was dated, December 21st 1793. Of the few con∣tributors to this work, Mr. Beresford (vide that name) was the chief. The second edition was printed in three duodecimo volumes; and the third, in four, with some additions.</P>
<P>Very few, indeed, are, in our opinion, the in∣stances, which the English language affords, of such finished specimens of essay-writing, as are to be found in the Looker-on. The taste, knowledge, and ingenuity, the sterling wit, the happy raillery, and the elegance of style, with which these papers are conceived and written, must ever characterise them as very first-rate performances of their kind; while we know of no instance, in particular, in which a writer has displayed greater power over the feelings of his readers, than in the beautiful and natural story of EUGENIO. The reigning whims and follies of the age have never, in our opinion, since the days of Addison been combated by the weapons of wit and reason with equal address: and, if the 'ur∣banity of criticism, the elegance of morality, and the playfulness of allusion,' which so remarkably distinguish the SPECTATOR, be any where to be looked for since those days, it must be in the lucu∣brations of Simon Olivebranch. The RAMBLER is assuredly the only periodical paper, which can, by any means, aspire to the rank of these two pro∣ductions; and, let none incautiously detract from
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
the solid merit of that performance. It has been truly called a body of ethics: and, to give it the highest possible praise, it is a work whose profundity and whose composition are worthy of the great logician and lexicographer whom it owns for its author. Yet, the charms with which Addison instructs, have gained him, with most readers, a preference to his great suc∣cessor; and the Looker-on, with a perfect origi∣nality of his own, and with the becoming character of a writer of his own time, is surely the SPEC∣TATOR, rather than the RAMBLER of his day.</P>
<P>It is a singular and a melancholy consideration that this work, although favourably received, has not experienced from the public that extraordinary distinction to which its extraordinary merit certainly entitled it; for let it be read for our amusement, for the improvement of our taste, or for the greater sakes of our religion and our morals, it shall be found to answer all our purposes with superior excel∣lence. Some blame has, perhaps, been justly bestowed upon the author, for an occasional ex∣cess, in the amplification of his subjects, and for an over-wrought nicety of style, too like what may be called a false refinement in writing: yet, these are but as dust in the balance. It is not to these causes, we fear, that we are to look for the evil; but to the tastelessness and insipidity of the larger portion of that shallow age in which the work was written. Melancholy, indeed, is the reflection that the good taste, which we once, undoubtedly,
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
possessed, should, so far, have forsaken us, as to neglect such distinguished merit!</P>
<P>We shall conclude this article by applying to Mr. Roberts the language used by one of Mr. Burke's political adversaries, when speaking of that transcendent writer; alledging as our reason for so doing, that, we know of no LIVING AUTHOR to whom we think them more properly applicable. <Q>He is a writer of the most splendid and une∣qualled powers; the fascination and magic of whose eloquence cannot be withstood. His im∣perial fancy has laid all nature under tribute, and has collected riches from every scene of the cre∣ation, and every walk of art. His images are so select, so rich with colours dipt in Heaven, that whoever can read his works without rapture may have merit as a reasoner, but must resign all pretensions to taste and sensibility.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall's Apology for the Freedom of the Press.</NOTE></P>

In 1795, he published a Translation, from the French, with Notes, of the Adventures of Telema∣chus, in two duodecimo volumes, founded on the Translation of Littlebury and Boyer, but greatly im∣proved.</P>

<HEAD>ROBINSON, MRS. MARY.</HEAD>
<P>The maiden name of this celebrated lady, who is descended from a very respectable family, was Darby. Her father lost his fortune in promoting a scheme for the commercial advantage of this coun∣try, and, afterward, accepted the command of a seventy-four-gun ship, in the service of the late Empress of Russia. Her mother is grand daughter to Catharine Seys, of Boverton Castle in Glamor∣ganshire; whose sister, Ann Seys, a woman cele∣brated for her virtues and accomplishments, married Lord King, then Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. Mrs. Robinson was born in the College Green, Bristol, received the early part of her educa∣tion in that city, and, at the age of fifteen, married her present husband, who was then a student in Lincoln's Inn. Shortly afterward, she thought it proper to exercise her talents on the stage, and came out in Juliet, under the particular patronage of the Dutchess of Devonshire, on the 10th of De∣cember, 1776. For three seasons she continued to perform the parts of Lady Macbeth, Imogen, Ro∣salind, Cordelia, Ophelia, Viola, Palmira, the Irish Widow, Perdita, &amp;c. with great applause; and, having in the latter character, attracted by her ele∣gance and beauty, the notice of a certain distin∣guished FLORIZEL, she quitted the stage at a
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
time when she was rising rapidly in the estimation of the public.</P>
<P>Of the literary productions of Mrs. Robinson, we believe, the first was a small octavo volume of "Poems," published in 1775. Two years after∣ward she wrote "Captivity," a poem, and Celadon and Lydia, a tale, which were printed together, in a quarto pamphlet, dedicated to her patroness, the Dutchess of Devonshire. In 1778, she brought out a farce, entitled, "The Lucky Escape," for her own benefit, at Drury Lane. None of these productions appear to have attracted that notice, by which the later writings of their fair author have been so re∣markably distinguished; and her pen appears to have been unemployed till about the year 1787, when she figured in the newspaper, THE WORLD, under the signature, Anna Matilda. For an ac∣count of the correspondence with Delia Crusca, kept up from poetical sympathy, at intervals, for two years, we refer the reader to our memoir of Mr. Merry; and shall only observe, that we think her poems in the collection, entitled, "The British Album," certainly claim the second place in point of merit. Mrs. Robinson also produced many pieces about this time in THE ORACLE, under the signatures Laura Maria, Julia, Laura, Oberon, &amp;c. In 1790, she published a poem, inscribed to Mr. Merry, under the title, <HI>Ainsi va le Monde</HI>; and, in the year following, produced her elegant octavo vo∣lume of "Poems," which was honoured by a
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
very splendid list of subscribers. The poetical productions with which Mrs. Robinson has fa∣voured the world, since that publication, are, a Monody to the Memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds; Sight, the Cavern of Woe, and Solitude, pub∣lished together, in a quarto pamphlet; Modern Manners, a poem, by Horace Juvenal; a Monody to the Memory of the late Queen of France; and Vol. II. of "Poems," in which some of these pieces are reprinted. In the year 1792, Mrs. Ro∣binson published her first novel, "Vancenza;" and has, since that time, written, "The Widow," "An∣gelina," and "Hubert de Sevrac," novels; and "The Sicilian Lover," a tragedy. Several popular Pamphlets have also been attributed to her pen.</P>
<P>The beauty of Mrs. Robinson's poetry has ob∣tained her the dignified appellation of THE ENG∣LISH SAPPHO. She is sometimes feeble, and some∣times degenerates into a false taste; but the poetic imagery, the feeling and tenderness, the warmth and elegance, and, above all, the delicacy of ex∣pression, which breathe through her poems can seldom fail to lay her reader under a bountiful contribution of applause. As a novel-writer, we think this lady much less successful. Her VAN∣CENZA speedily reached a third edition, because it was the work of Mrs. Robinson; but surely in falls greatly short of many of her countrywomen, this, as well as in her subsequent attempts, she in the talent of pleasing. Her tragedy (The Si∣cilian
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
Lover) is a very favourable specimen, in∣deed, of her talent in that line of composition!</P>

In the Autumn of the year 1797, Pro∣fessor Robison published an octavo volume, entitled, "Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the se∣cret Meetings of Free-masons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies: collected from good Authori∣ties." This volume, has been favourably re∣ceived; and although too hasty a performance for a work of so much consequence, is well enti∣tled both from its subject and by its authenticity, to the serious attention of every reader.

<HEAD>ROSCOE, WILLIAM, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>Of Liverpool. A gentleman who has acquired great and merited renown in the literary world, by the masterly manner in which he has, of late, ex∣hibited to the public, the Life and Labours of Lo∣renzo de' Medici, called the Magnificent. Mr. Roscoe was brought up to the profession of an attorney, but does not, we believe, at present, prac∣tice in that line. The above-mentioned work does the highest credit to his literary talents, and entitles him to rank with the very first writers on European History. The circumstances attending this publi∣cation, are not among the least singular in the annals of literature. The full, distinct, and accurate idea afforded us, with such genius and learning, of the interesting subject treated in these volumes, is the result of discoveries made in the literature of one of the most polite and learned nations of Europe, by a foreigner who had never visited that country! By a gentleman who was not courting literature in academical bowers, but devoting his time to an active and a laborious profession! Mr. Clarke a banker of Liverpool, and son of the late banker of the same name, a gentleman of very extensive
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
information, and the intimate friend of Mr. Roscoe, had paid a visit to Italy, and had fixed his winter residence at Florence. It was through the assiduity of this gentleman, that Mr. Roscoe obtained his large stock of original and interesting information; as well as the beautiful Poems of Lorenzo de' Me∣dici (with copies of which, as well as with beau∣tiful and exact Translations of them, he has enriched his work) the originals of which are deposited in the Laurentian Library, although the former editiors appear not to have had the slightest information re∣specting them! The work made its first appearance in 1795, in two volumes, quarto, under the title, "The Life of Lorenzo de' Medici, called the Mag∣nificent." Such, we have understood, was the au∣thor's diffidence of its success, that the first im∣pression consisted of only two hundred and fifty co∣pies! So small a number disappeared very soon after publication; and, although the work was printed in the expensive style and sold at a propor∣tional price, it has seen three editions, even in times so unpropitious as the present. Nor (as every reader can foretel) has it obtained early po∣pularity, without the prospect of a lasting reputation. It holds the place which it fills in the History of Europe by too lawful a tenure ever to renounce its privileges.</P>
<P>The celebrated and excellent Letter to Mr. Pitt, BY JASPER WILSON, has been improperly attributed to Mr. Roscoe. It is the production of
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
his friend Dr. James Currie of Liverpool; and, we believe, that the largest share he had in that publication was a perusal of the original copy, and some little assistance he may have given in revising the sheets, as they came from the press. Mr. Ros∣coe has been engaged, for some time, we under∣stand, upon a Life of Burns the Scotch poet.</P>

<P>Of Gray's Inn. Late of Trinity College, Cam∣bridge; and, formerly, of Westminster School.

In 1797, Mr. Rough published "Lorenzino di Medici, and other Poems," in a small duodecimo volume, dedicated to Mr. Roscoe, to whom Mr. Rough is wholly unknown, but for whose character, as an author, he thus expresses his great esteem. Notwithstanding Mr. Rough's hopes that his tragedy has some claim to the honours of a legitimate drama, we must beg leave to say of his volume, that the dedication is absurd, the four first acts of the tragedy woefully dull, and the sonnets which follow, pretty, rather than otherwise. He is also the writer of the poe∣try in the Monthly Magazine, signed W. R. GRAY'S-INN.

<P>The author of a very beautiful dramatic poem, which has been much admired, entitled, "The Mine."

This poem was first published (in quarto), in 1785; and has, since that time, been reprinted, with the addition of two Historic Odes, which are not unworthy of Gray, in a duodecimo vo∣lume.

This was followed by two Letters to Mr. Burke, in Defence of Mr. Has∣tings; a Letter to Mr. Fox; a Narrative of Trans∣actions in Bengal; two Replies to Speeches by Mr. Burke; and "The Conduct of his Majesty's late Ministers considered, as it affected the East India Company and Mr. Hastings," (published in 1784). Several of his Speeches in Parliament also, about this time, reached the press; and innume∣rable
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
letters, paragraphs, puffs, and squibs, which appeared in the newspapers, were attributed to him. A very curious bill of the latter, to the amount of several hundred pounds, was published in 1787, by the Editor of the Morning Herald. Could perseverance and confidence have gained a cause, the triumph of the indefatigable Major would have been complete; and, accordingly, they had their weight while the question respecting Mr. Hastings remained in loose and general terms. It has, however, been imputed to Major Scott, that, notwithstanding the temerity of his zeal, he was considerably instrumental in bringing his Principal into the miserable situation, which he was so long constrained to endure.</P>

<P>A lady who has acquired considerable reputa∣tion by her Poetical Talents; and who has also been celebrated for her great excellence in the art of reading. She is the daughter of the late Rev. Thomas Seward, Rector of Eyam in Derbyshire, Prebendary of Salisbury, and Canon Residentiary of Litchfield. From this parent she received the advantage of a good education, discovered early symptoms of the rhyming propensity, and, becom∣ing acquainted with the late Lady Miller of Bath-Easton, was a frequent and, sometimes, a success∣ful candidate for the myrtle wreath of the poetic institution of that villa. Her first regular publica∣tion was a beautiful Elegy on Captain Cook, which,
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>
together with an Ode to the Sun (a Bath-Easton Prize Poem) was published in a quarto pamphlet, in 1780. In the year following, she produced a Monody on her gallant and amiable friend Major Andrè; and, it is said, that Dr. Darwin, speaking of this poem and the one on Captain Cook, used to tell her she was the inventress of Epic Elegy. Miss Seward's subsequent productions have been, a Poem to the Memory of Lady Miller; Louisa, a poetical novel; an Ode on General Elliot's Return from Gibraltar; and "Llangollen Vale, with other Poems," published in a quarto pamphlet, in 1796.</P>
<P>Of these productions, perhaps, the first, in point of popularity, is the poetical novel; while the one held in highest estimation for poetical value, by the fair author herself, is, we are told, the Ode on General Elliot's Return. Miss Seward's perpetual study of uncommon and poetical expression has not unfrequently led her into affectation and obscurity; yet, the general harmony of her numbers, her re∣fined sentiment, her elegant description, and her copious imagery, will always insure her many ad∣mirers. Beside the poems above mentioned, she has contributed many original fugitive Pieces, and some Translations of Odes of Horace to the Gen∣tleman's Magazine; and has announced for speedy publication, a collection (in quarto) to be entitled, "Sonnets and Horatian Odes."</P>

<HEAD>SHERIDAN, RICHARD BRINSLEY, ESQ. M.P.</HEAD>
<P>This celebrated character is of a family which during the greater part of the present century has been eminent for genius and learning. His grand∣father was the intimate friend and favourite of Doctor Swift, the companion of his leisure, the sha∣rer of his confidence, and the imitator of his wit. His father was the corrector of the English accent, and was acknowledged to be the best declaimer in the English Language of his day: he was, for a
<PB N="251" REF="252"/>
considerable time, manager of the Dublin Theatre, and being compelled, by the animosity of party, to quit that situation, acquired same and profit in London as an actor, and as a lecturer. The mo∣ther of Mr. Sheridan could also boast a distinguished literary reputation, obtained by several Plays, No∣vels, and other Pieces of considerable merit.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan was born at Quilea, near Dublin, in the year 1752. At the age of six years, his fa∣ther, then compelled to quit his native country, brought him to England, and placed him at Harrow School, under the care of Dr. Sumner, who was, at that time, the head-master. Here Mr. Sheridan contracted a friendship with Dr. Parr, then one of the under-masters, which has, ever since subsisted, between them. It does not appear that he was ever a member of either of the Universities; but, the law being his destination, was entered of the Middle Temple. At the age of eighteen years, he translated from the Greek, in association with a friend, the Epistles of Aristaenetus, and also, about that time, printed several pieces, which are known only to his intimate friends, and among which, we believe, was an Answer to the celebrated Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers. Residing for some time at Bath, he became acquainted with Miss Elizabeth Linley, daughter of the late Paten∣tee of Drury Lane, of that name. This lady, celebrated no less, in her day, for her mental than for her personal accomplishments, was highly dis∣tinguished,
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>
at that time, as a public singer: and a part of her story, very honourable to herself, rela∣tive to a proposal of marriage, is commemorated by Foote, under the character of Miss Linnet, in his comedy, entitled, "The Maid of Bath." Not long after this affair, Mr. Sheridan made honourable proposals to her, and was engaged, on her account in a duel, with a Captain Matthews, which was very singular for the courage, ferocity, and invete∣rate resentment displayed by the parties. In 1773, his suit was crowned with success; and, though his lady brought him little or no fortune, it has been supposed that his subsequent figure in the world, has been, in some degree owing to this marriage. He was now in his twenty-second or twenty-third year, and even at this early period, discovered that pride and dignity of mind, which, though not always desirable companions in the commerce of life, are mostly characteristic of a ge∣nerous spirit, and a true genius. For, notwith∣standing his narrow circumstances, and the distance at which he was then removed from those brilliant prospects, which he afterward had in view, he would not allow Mrs. Sheridan to engage herself at any place of public entertainment.</P>
<P>Depending on his own talents alone for support, Mr. Sheridan first turned his thoughts to dramatic composition; and, in January, 1775, brought out at Covent Garden Theatre his comedy, THE RIVALS. This piece, as it was originally played,
<PB N="253" REF="254"/>
nearly doubled in length the generality of theatri∣cal performances. It suffered greatly on the first night from the severity of the audience, and with difficulty obtained a second hearing. Several causes conspired to produce this effect, among which, in justice to Mr. Sheridan, must be mentioned the miserable manner in which some of the performers (Mr. Lee in particular) acted their parts. Being, however, new moulded by the author, it was re∣ceived with considerable applause, and has conti∣nued a favourite with the public. This play abounds in character and situation: yet, though it bears indisputable marks of the fertility of the au∣thor's genius, it is, certainly, far from a perfect composition. The character of Mrs. Malaprop, who is distinguished from the ordinary run of illi∣terate pretenders, by the mere circumstance of her pronouncing hard words correctly, but using them in an improper sense, instead of murdering, the words themselves, as is usually the case, is surely ill-conceived and unnatural. The idea of Acres, with his new-fangled oaths, always swear∣ing by objects appropriate to the subject of which he is treating, seems an equal violation of proba∣bility; and there appears to run through the piece an endeavour to give character and originality, which is always built upon affected circumstances, and not upon experience and knowledge of human nature. When Mr. Sheridan published this co∣medy, he acknowldged his youth and inexperience,
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
and adopted the error of dreading imitation, assert∣ing in his preface that, <Q>on subjects on which the mind has been much informed, invention is slow of exerting itself.</Q> Yet, it has always happened in some degree to those writers, who think that the want of information will assist their invention, that they have incurred the very censure they were anxious to avoid, and have exhibited as new what is stale and hackneyed, and what a more in∣timate acquaintance with their subject would have taught them to reject. In this year he also produced, St. Patrick's Day, a farce, which was originally represented for the benefit of Mr. Clinch, who seems to have been favoured with it, in conse∣quence or his representation of the Irishman in the Rivals, in which he greatly excelled Mr. Lee.</P>
<P>In the following year, Mr. Sheridan enriched the English drama, with his celebrated comic opera, THE DUENNA. The success of this piece was beyond all former example. The Beggar's Opera which had all the wits and half the nobi∣lity of England for its supports, ran sixty-three nights in one season; the Duenna, seventy-five. The satire of this piece is beautiful and poignant; the flashes of wit are perpetual and always genuine; while the songs are characterised by that <HI>onction.</HI> that ripeness and mellowness of expression, which is, probably, the grand secret of song-writing. This piece did not reach the press, by the author's consent till the year 1794.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256"/>But, even the merit of the Duenna was thrown into comparative oblivion on the appearance, in the following year, of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL. No dramatic production ever equalled this cele∣brated piece in success. It can receive no honour from additional praise, nor is it likely to be injured by the severest critical examination. Character it is true, is not the fort even of this greatest pro∣duction of our author; yet, the plot is so natural, the mirror held up so true, the incidents follow with such ease and grace, the dialogue is so chaste and lively, the wit so brilliant and stirling, and every thing is so exquisitely finished and so happily conveyed, that our entertainment is unbounded, and we can never enough applaud our mirth. This piece (the policy, as we suppose, of our earliest theatres being on this occasion revived) has never lawfully reached the press, though, some editions of it have been printed in Ireland, from a smug∣gled copy, and sold here.</P>
<P>In 1778, Mr. Sheridan brought out at Drury Lane "The Camp," a dramatic entertainment, intended to compliment the Dutchess of Devonshire, which has never been printed; and, in the follow∣ing year, "The Critic, or a Tragedy Rehearsed," a farce, which <HI>has</HI> reached the press. The Critic is distinguished by that genuine wit, which has so often characterised the productions of its author, and is a piece which has obtained the frequently repeated applauses of the public. Its first act has
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
particular merit, in the character of Sir Fretful Plagiary, which, as is well known, is a satire upon Mr. Richard Cumberland, a gentleman of mild and amiable manners, but, who is probably, in some degree, subject to the weakness here ridiculed, and who had been so ill-advised, or so unfortunate as to give offence to Mr. Sheridan. The two last acts, which consist of a mock tragedy, have as much merit as their subject will allow, under the two-fold disadvantage of being barren in itself, and of having been anticipated by the popular comedy of the Rehearsal. The author of the Rehearsal had the advantage of writing in an aera of false taste, and of having for the topic of his ridicule, the absurdities of so great a genius as Mr. Dryden. The errors of more modern tragedies were too evan∣escent for satire, and Mr. Sheridan, in order to be intelligible, was obliged, sometimes to have re∣course to the best passages of Shakspeare: now it is true that our mirth may be excited by a travesty of Homer or Virgil, but we never can applaud the author. To the pen of Mr. Sheridan are also to be attributed, "A Trip to Scarborough," a co∣medy, as <HI>altered</HI> from Vanburgh's <HI>Relapse</HI>; a Mo∣nody to the Memory of Mr. Garrick, which would have reflected lustre upon an inferior genius, but added nothing to our admiration of Mr. Sheridan; the Prologue to Captain Ayscough's tragedy, Semi∣ramis, which is a beautiful piece of poetry; and several more highly elegant trifles, which are to be
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
found in different collections of fugitive pieces. The public has also, for many years, been flattered with the hopes of receiving from the same source, "The Foresters," a comic opera; and Affectation, a comedy; but, from the length of their delay, we may be led to despair of their appearance.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1776, when Mr, Garrick re∣tired from the stage, that Mr. Sheridan purchased, in association with Mr. Linley his father-in-law, and with Dr. Ford, one moiety of the property of Dru∣ry Lane Theatre; to which they soon afterward added the other moiety. Mr. Sheridan's share of this property is said to have been more than a half; and, for some years, he continued the acting ma∣nager of the theatre. His carelessness and inatten∣tion to the interests of this situation were very con∣spicuous, and the credit of old Drury certainly lost: a sturdy prop in her celebrated Garrick. But, hav∣ing completed every thing with regard to the stage, to which his ambition could aspire, Mr. Sheridan turned the activity of his mind to another object, and was encouraged, by the friendship of Mr. Fox, to offer himself a candidate for representing the town of Stafford in the Parliament, which was summoned to meet October 30th, 1780. The new life into which his success introduced him, exalted his views, and, by engaging his talents in the concerns of his country, has had a fatal effect on his dramatic pursuits.

<P>Mr. Sheridan did not inherit from nature every advantage toward making him a great public speaker. His voice, in particular, was neither strong, harmonious, nor of considerable compass. He had, however, the benefit of a remarkably clear and accurate articulation, and was early initiated in ideas of public speaking by his father. The difficul∣ties under which he laboured were conquered by unwearied perseverance, and by the exercise of his voice on trifling topics and ordinary occasions. This conquest was not completed when he was appointed, in 1782, Under Secretary of State, in the department of Mr. Fox, or when, in the year following, he was promoted to the place of Secre∣tary to the Treasury under the Duke of Portland. In the session of 1785, he made a celebrated Speech upon the fourth of the twenty Irish Propositions; and, in the following year, upon a motion, brought forward by himself, upon the subject of finance: of the former of these Speeches a tolerable report was published, and has been inserted in the Par∣liamentary Register. But Mr. Sheridan rose to his greatest height, as a speaker, in 1787, when he opened the third article of impeachment, in the House of Commons, against Mr. Hastings, upon the subject of the punishment inflicted by him for the rebellion of the Princesses of Oude. This
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
speech was five hours and a half in length, and those who heard it seemed to think that no lan∣guage could do justice to its wit, its sublimity, and its pathos. It is hardly necessary to add that Mr. Sheridan has, for many years, been one of the most distinguished leaders of the opposition. As an elegant scholar, we may safely say he has not a superior in the senate of his country; and, however different the sensations may be, with which his cha∣racter will impress some of those who contemplate him as a genius and as a man, the urbanity of his behaviour in that assembly, and the uniformly clas∣sical elegance and grace of his diction, must command the admiration of all.</P>
<P>Not many years after the loss of his first wife, Mr. Sheridan married, in 1794, Miss Ogle, daughter of the Dean of Winchester. About this time he attempted to dispose of his property in the theatre, but, though he sold a part of it, he still retains the larger share.</P>

He was educated at the High-school, Edinburgh, and at the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford. In the year 1780, he was chosen Member for Caithness, his native county, which he represented in two Parliaments, and was chosen, at the last election, for Petersfield, Hants. Sir John Sinclair is distinguished for his knowledge of Finance, Agriculture, and Statistics. He published, in the year 1782, "Observations on the Scottish Dialect," designed to remove the distinction which

a different dialect had produced between nations united under the same government, and connected by similar customs and laws; also "Lucubrations during a short Recess," an anonymous pamphlet; and "Thoughts on the Naval Strength of the Bri∣tish Empire," a pamphlet. The anonymous pam∣phlet produced several Answers, one, in particular, by Lord Camelford, drawn up with great ability: the Pamphlet on our Naval Strength was also an∣swered from the press. In the following year, Sir John Sinclair wrote a pamphlet, entitled, "Hints addressed to the Public," on the state of our finances, which (in opposition to the Earl of Stair, among other writers) was the first of the publications as∣serting the ample resources of the nation. His subsequent productions have been, "The History of the Public Revenue of the British Empire," a very elaborate and interesting work, in two volumes, quarto, of which the first was published in 1785; "State of Alterations which may be proposed in the Laws for regulating the Election of Members of Parliament for Shires in Scotland," a pamphlet, published in 1787; an Address to the Edinburgh Society for the Improvement of British Wool, of which Sir John was appointed chairman; an Ad∣dress to the Landed Interest, on the Corn Bill, (1791); "Statistical Account of Scotland," drawn up from the communications of the ministers of the different parishes, in twenty volumes, octavo, of which the two first were published in 1792, a work

These poems, characterised by great elegance of feeling and beauty of expression, have been very frequently reprinted, and, with many subsequent additions, are now published in two duodecimo vo∣lumes, under the title, "Elegiac Sonnets and other Poems." In 1787, Mrs. Smith published "The Romance of Real Life," in three duodecimo vo∣lumes, which is a compilation from a voluminous French work, entitled <HI>"Causes celebreè, &amp;c."</HI> and, in the year following, "Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle," a novel.

In the year following, he published Joan of Arc, an epic Poem, in a quarto volume, about four hun∣dred lines of which, at the beginning of the second book, were contributed by his friend Mr. Cole∣ridge. This performance, as originally written in twelve books, was finished in six weeks; and on its improved plan in ten books, was almost entirely recomposed during the time of printing! The poetical powers displayed in this poem are of a

In 1797, Mr. Southey pub∣lished a duodecimo volume of Poems, which has been very generally admired, and abounds in pieces of exquisite beauty.

as an author has been in the Account he has pub∣lished of the Embassy to China. This long ex∣pected work made its appearance in August, 1797; in two volumes, quarto, accompanied by a folio volume of plates, under the title, "An Authentic Account of the Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China." Such was the public curiosity, that, although it was printed in a very expensive style, and the impression consisted of a large number of copies, every one was sub∣scribed for long before the day of publication. An octavo edition of it, in three volumes, has been published since its first appearance. The AC∣COUNT was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary; of Sir Erasmus Gower, Com∣mander of the expedition; and of other gentlemen in the several departments of the Embassy. Though it may be said to contain little additional infor∣mation respecting China, to what was already to be found in the writings of Duhalde, Grosier, and others who have travelled in that country, it must be confessed that Sir George Staunton en∣joyed peculiar advantages for describing with ac∣curacy the physical as well as moral state of the vast empire. So remarkable an instance of the ne∣cessary abilities and opportunities to collect infor∣mation, and of strict authenticity in reporting it, as concurred in the case of the gentlemen who accompanied this embassy, can very rarely

<P>The life of Mr. Percival Stockdale has been marked by various misfortunes, and discouraging circumstances. As a writer he has never been po∣pular, and his miscarriage has been somewhat un∣fortunate. He seems to labour under an extreme irritability of the nervous system, which has never allowed him to endure the rebukes of honest criti∣cism. He is paradoxical, without being ingenious; he is new, without the power of invention; and he possesses the true poetic melancholy without one spark of poetic fire.</P>

<P>This gentleman was Member for New Romney in the last Parliament, and has, we believe, spent part of his life in India. His first publication was "A Tour through Parts of England, Scotland, and Wales," in a series of Letters, which ap∣peared in 1780, in two volumes octavo. Not long after this, he published a Letter to the East India Directors; an Analysis of the Political History of India, in an octavo volume; Thoughts on Martial Law, a pamphlet; and Philosophical Rhapsodies, Fragments of Akbur of Betlis, containing Reflec∣tions on the Laws, Manners, Customs, and Reli∣gions of certain Asiatic, Afric, and European Na∣tions," in three octavo volumes. The last of these works, though said to be written by a native of Assyria, was soon found to be much more deeply tinctured with European than with Oriental Phi∣losophy. In 1794, Mr. Sulivan published "A View of Nature, in Letters to a Traveller among the Alps," in six volumes, octavo; a work whose title at∣tracted a degree of curiosity, which its contents were but ill able to gratify.

<HEAD>SWINBURNE, HENRY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>This celebrated traveller is the youngest son of the late Sir John Swinburne, Bart. of Capheaton in Northumberland, the long-established seat of that ancient Roman Catholic family. He was edu∣cated
<PB N="290" REF="291"/>
at Scorton School in Yorkshire; and, after∣ward, studied at Paris, Bourdeaux, and the Royal Academy at Turin. After this he made the usual tour of Italy, and, in 1774, travelled with his lady on the Continent, for the express purpose of in∣dulging their taste for antiquities and the fine arts. Mr. Swinburne spent six years in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, during which time he formed an intimacy with some of the most celebrated lite∣rati of those countries, and received some signal marks of esteem from the Sovereigns of the courts he visited. On his return to England he retired to his seat at Hamsterly, in the Bishoprick of Dur∣ham, which has been his place of chief residence since that time. The first of Mr. Swinburne's pub∣lications was his quarto volume of Travels through Spain, which appeared in 1779. Four years af∣terward he published Vol. I. (in quarto) of his celebrated Travels in the two Sicilies; to which Vol. II. was added two years afterward. Both of these works have been reprinted in octavo; the first in two, and the last in four volumes. The learning and ingenuity of Mr. Swinburne are too well known to require an additional panegyric from us. The warmth and animation of his descriptions dis∣cover an imagination highly susceptible to every beauty of nature, or of art; and, if he have a fault it is, that he is too apt to relinquish simplicity for profusion of ornament.</P>

<HEAD>THELWALL, JOHN.</HEAD>
<P>This conspicuous character, after a very infe∣rior education, was articled to an attorney; and early in life exhibited that restless, unsatisfied, tur∣bulent disposition, by which he has of late peculi∣arly distinguished himself. Upon the publication
<PB N="302" REF="303"/>
of Paine's "Rights of Man," Mr. Thelwall was one of the first to display a zealous attachment to his principles; and he soon afterward began to deli∣ver a course of Lectures of an inflammatory ten∣dency, at Beaufort Buildings in the Strand. Here, evening after evening, he thundered out philip∣pics against the Constitution of his country, with the vehemence of an impassioned demagogue, to the admiration of the vilest refuse of the metropo∣lis. In the year 1794, these Discourses were in∣terrupted by the hand of Government, and the ora∣tor was conveyed to the Tower to take his trial, together with Hardy, Tooke and some other un∣ruly citizens. During his confinement, Mr. Thel∣wall wrote some Poems, which were published after his release. Having been tried at the Sessions House, Old Bailey, in November, 1794, and ac∣quitted with the other prisoners, his subsequent behaviour has been no less marked by its mis∣chievous tendency, than it was previously to his imprisonment. Under the semblance of illustrating Ancient History, he has continued his political Lectures, and has transferred his pernicious school to different parts of the country. At Yarmouth he was, some time ago, interrupted in a very se∣rious manner in the midst of his oratory, by the abrupt entrance of a body of sailors, who were heated with liquor, and who, actuated by an im∣iprudent zeal, committed several unjustifiable acts
<PB N="303" REF="304"/>
of violence upon the auditory. He also experienced some riotous opposition at Lynn and at Wisbeach.</P>
<P>As an author, Mr. Thelwall made his first ap∣pearance in 1787, when he published Orlando and Almeyda, a legendary tale in the manner of Gold∣smith, and also "Poems on various Subjects," in two duodecimo volumes. The touching simplicity which is characteristic of true poetry, is, in these wretched pieces, supplied by a plain prosaic dic∣tion, which is as remote as possible from it. After this unfortunate attempt, Mr. Thelwall did not seek the press again till the year 1794, when No. I. of his Political Lectures made its appearance. In the following year he published "The Natural and Constitutional Right of Britons to Annual Parlia∣ments, Universal Suffrage, and the Freedom of Po∣pular Association," the Speech which he intended to have delivered on his trial. His subsequent pro∣ductions have been "Sober Reflections on the Se∣ditious and Inflammatory Letter of the Rt. Hon.

In pursuing these enquiries, he made some valuable discoveries in the construction of Chimneys; and was enabled to point out means, which have since been successfully put in practice in this country also, of increasing the heat, and, at the same time, decreasing the quantity of fuel.

<HEAD>TOOKE, JOHN, HORNE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>This celebrated character was formerly, while he bore the sirname of Horne, a member of St. John's College, Cambridge, and afterward a Clergyman of Brentford in Middlesex. He took a very active part in the election canvas of Mr. Wilkes, at the me∣morable period of 1768; and was deeply concerned with Messrs. Glynn, Sawbridge, Oliver, Townsend, Bellas, Vaughan, &amp;c. in the subsequent measures, for the support of Mr. Wilkes' cause, and in the in∣stitution of the Society of the Bill of Rights. An accusation having been brought against Mr. Wilkes, that he strove to engross the whole subscription money of this society to himself, and that he would not permit the other sufferers in the cause of liberty to share in its benefits, Mr. Horne together with many others, deserted his political leader, and a newspaper controversy, soon afterward, broke out between these two gentleman, in which they very liberally accused each other of roguery and swindling, about an <HI>important</HI> affair of a Welch poney, and a packet of foul linen. Mr. Horne also entered the lists with the celebrated JUNIUS, a con∣test
<PB N="314" REF="315"/>
in which the political divine is commonly thought to have come off second-best. While Minister of New Brentford, he published in the year 1796, a single Sermon on the precarious tenure of human friend∣ship; and, in the year following, an Oration which he delivered at a numerous Meeting of the Free∣holders of Middlesex, at Mile-end Assembly Room, March 30th, 1770, to consider of an Address, Re∣monstrance, and Petition to his Majesty. It is probable that the manner in which he had embroiled himself in political dispute, and the conspicuous and improper part which he had acted, were his in∣ducements to the resignation of his gown. Since that time he has made himself a most conspicuous champion of republicanism. In the year 1777, he was tried for a libel, in having charged the King's troops with murdering the American soldiery at Lexington and Bunker's Hill. He subpoenaed Lord George Sackville and, several of the King's Ministers, who did not think it proper to answer his summons; and, having undertaken to plead his own cause, he delivered a speech three hours in length, full of ingenuity, argument, and shrewdness. This speech, printed in the State Trials, is highly creditable to his talents, as a constitutional lawyer.</P>
<P>Mr. Horne was, at this time, preparing himself for the bar; but objections were raised to exclude him from the profession he had chosen, and in se∣veral attempts which he made to address his old audiences of freeholders and others, he was con∣stantly
<PB N="315" REF="316"/>
overborne and silenced. The native energy of his mind enabled him to find a consolation amid these disappointments in the pursuits of literature and having applied himself to the study of Universal Grammar, the first fruit of his labour appeared in a Letter to Mr. John Dunning (Lord Ashburton) published in 1777. This pamphlet, now become very scarce, is the skeleton of his subsequent cele∣brated work on this subject, to be noticed here∣after; and it is said Dr. Johnson thought so well of it, that he told a friend, if he ever printed a new edition of his dictionary, he should adopt many of Mr. Horne's etymologies of the conjunctions. Five years after this he published a Letter to Lord Ash∣burton on Parliamentary Reform, which was re∣printed by Ridgway in 1794. Mr. Horne assumed the sirname of Tooke in the year 1782, in conse∣quence of the will of Andrew Tooke Esq. a gentle∣man who bequeathed him an estate; and in 1786 he published celebrated etymological work, entitled, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Diversions of Purley, in an octavo volume. These WINGED WORDS obtained the above title from Purley near Croydon, at that time the residence of the author, and formerly the seat of President Bradshaw. In this work Mr. Tooke has pointed out, and has himself proceeded far in, a path before untrodden, and evidently leading to improve∣ments, by which the science of grammar may be established on a sure basis. It has been highly ad∣mired, and is conceived by the generality of its rea∣ders
<PB N="316" REF="317"/>
to have totally demolished the system of Mr. James Harris of Salisbury, who had long shared in profusion the compliments of the literari. A con∣tinuation of his grammatical researches has been promised to the world; and we have understood that "The Diversions of Purley," are reprinting in quarto. In the year 1787, Mr. Tooke published an extraordinary Letter in defence of Mrs. Fitzherbert, under the idea of her being the lawful consort of the Prince of Wales; and in the year following "Two pair of Portraits," a pamphlet, exhibiting, in the painter's own style, the late Lords Chatham and Holland, and their sons Messrs Pitt and Fox.</P>
<P>Mr. Tooke distinguished himself some years ago as the strenuous partisan of Lord Hood in the West∣minster Election. In 1792 an action of debt, foun∣ded on the statute 28 Geo III. c. 52, was brought against him by Mr. Fox for the sum of £ 198 2<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> the taxed amount of Mr. Fox's expences, incurred in defending himself against the memorable petition presented by Mr. Tooke to the House of Commons. The verdict of the Jury was, with great deliberation and justice, in favour of the plaintiff, and Mr. Tooke himself published an account of the proceed∣ings. Being a very active Member of the Corre∣sponding Society, he was taken into custody in May 1794, by a warrant from the Secretary of State, on suspicion, of High Treason, and was afterward com∣mitted to the Tower. His trial came on at the Ses∣sions House in the Old Baily, the November follow∣ing
<PB N="317" REF="318"/>
together with those of Hardy, Thelwall, &amp;c. and ended in his acquittal. In 1796 he offered him∣self for the second time as a candidate for representing the City of Westminster in company with Messrs. Fox, and Admiral Sir Alan Gardner. Not having any prospect of success, he amused himself upon the hustings with deriding Sir Alan Gardner before an ignorant unprincipled mob!</P>
<P>However unpopular Mr. Tooke may have made himself with the better part of mankind by the dis∣tinction he has aimed at as a Philosopher of the New Sect, he is certainly entitled to the credit of first-rate abilities. His style is clear and nervous, and the acuteness of his intellect has seldom been equalled. As a Scholar and Philologist his fame will probably live while our language exists; and even as a Politician it has been said for him, that he is one of the few of his day whose conduct has been uniformly consistent with itself.</P>

It was in the year 1791, that Mr. Townsend favoured the pub∣lic with an Account of his Journey through Spain, in 1786, and 1787, in three octavo volumes. This work, upon the whole, does great credit to its author; but had he been less circumstantial on sub∣jects of chemistry and natural history, as well as in describing local peculiarities of the country, he would probably have succeeded better in the im∣portant point of attracting readers. Since the ap∣pearance of this his chief publication, Mr. Towns∣end has set a very praise-worthy example to his reverend brethren, by the proofs he has given the world of his attention to medical subjects.

<P>A Literary Pedlar, whose small-ware is of the vilest quality. The first commodity which he of∣fered to the public was a duodecimo volume, en∣titled, "Chronology," published in 1768, and which was, afterward, amplified into two volumes. Since that time, he has spawned upon the pub∣lic innumerable goods of commercial, historical, theological, political, &amp;c. fabric, which are too contemptible to deserve enumeration. He is the publisher of the worse of the two Clerical Alma∣nacks, and vends Sermons for the use of the pulpit, printed in imitation of hand-writing, the most un∣speakable

<HEAD>TUCKER, REV. JOSIAH, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>Dean of Gloucester. A gentleman chiefly ce∣lebrated for his commercial and political Tracts. In the early part of his life he was Rector of St. Stephen's, Bristol, and Chaplain to the Bishop of that diocese. His first publication was an excellent treatise, entitled, "A brief Essay on the Advan∣tages and Disadvantages which respectively attend France and Great Britain, with regard to trade." Some years afterward, in 1751, he published Part I. of Reflections on the Expediency of a Law for the Naturalization of foreign Protestants; to which Part II. was soon afterward added. Since that time, he has written many more pamphlets in this class, a collection of which has been made, in an octavo volume, under the title, "Tracts on Political and Commercial Subjects." Dr. Tucker also published, in 1781, a Treatise concerning Civil Government, in reply to Mr. Locke, an octavo volume. The boldness and spirit which he displayed, as a politi∣cal writer, at one time, brought the credit of his understanding considerably into question. But his
<PB N="331" REF="332"/>
early argument in favour of a separation from Ame∣rica, and his reasonings to shew that no ma∣terial disadvantage would arise from it, were so far confirmed by experience, and his principles in fa∣vour of free trade so naturally approved themselves to unbiassed minds, that he was not long without a numerous set of admirers.</P>
<P>In the class of Divinity Dr. Tucker's first pub∣lication was an excellent tract, in 1772, entitled, "An Apology" for the Church of England, written in opposition to the petitioning Clergy. This was by far the best pamphlet on the occasion. Soon afterward, he published "Six Sermons," in a duo∣decimo volume; Letters to Dr. Kippis on his Vin∣dication of the Protestant Dissenting Ministers; two Sermons, together with four Tracts on politi∣cal and commercial subjects; an Essay on Reli∣gious Intolerance; a View of the Difficulties of the Trinitarian, Arian, and Socinian Systems; and Seventeen Sermons, in an octavo volume.</P>

<HEAD>WAKEFIELD, GILBERT, B.A.</HEAD>
<P>Of Hackney. A very distinguished Classical Scholar: formerly a clergyman of the Establish∣ment, at present, a dissenting layman. Mr. Wakefield was born at Nottingham, in 1756, his father being then Rector of St. Nicholas, in that
<PB N="348" REF="349"/>
town. He was educated at the Free-school, Not∣tingham; under the Rev. Richard Wooddeson, of Kingston-upon-Thames; and at Jesus College, Cambridge: having, in his earliest infancy, disco∣vered that ardent desire of knowledge, which, from his unceasing application, appears never to have been impaired. At the "University Mr. Wakefield cultivated useful learning with great success; and, on his admission to the degree of B. A. in 1776, received distinguished honours for his mathematical, as well as for his classical at∣tainments. Soon after this he was elected Fellow of Jesus College; and, in 1778, was ordained a deacon. Mr. Wakefield was even then so little satisfied with the requisition of <HI>subscription,</HI> and with the subjects of that subscription themselves, that, as he properly confesses in the MEMOIRS of his own Life, he has since regarded this acquiescence as an action highly disingenuous. While he held his station in the Church, which has now for many years been relinquished, he was successively, for a short time, curate of Stockport in Cheshire, and of St. Peter's and St. Paul's in Liverpool. In the year 1779, he removed to Warrington in Lan∣cashire, to accept the office of Classical Tutor at the dissenting Academy in that town. Here Mr. Wakefield remained until the dissolution of that seminary, in 1783, when he removed to Bramcote near Nottingham, with a view of receiving pupils; and, after a short residence at this place, and at
<PB N="349" REF="350"/>
Richmond, lived for some years at Nottingham, in the same occupation. In 1790, he was chosen Classical Tutor of the New College, Hackney; since which time, that town has been the place of his residence. His connexion with the college ended a year after his acceptance of his office, and his subsequent days have been spent in a diligent prosecution of his studies.</P>
<P>Mr. Wakefield commenced author in the year 1776; when he printed, at the Cambrige press <HI>Poemata Latine partim Scripta partim Reddita,</HI> with a few critical Observations on Horace, in a small quarto volume. Although he has since discovered one <HI>false quantity</HI> in these poems, they do him great credit as a very elegant scholar at an early age. His next publication was a new Translation of St. Paul's first Epistle to the Thessalonians, ac∣companied by such notes as were necessary to justify his variations from the established version. This was published in 1781, and experienced a favourable reception. His numerous subsequent publications followed each other at no very con∣siderable intervals of time, in nearly the following order, viz. an Essay on Inspiration, considered chiefly with respect to the Evangelists; a short Treatise on Baptism; a new Translation of St. Matthew, with Notes, critical, philological, and explanatory, in a quarto volume; Vol. I. (in oc∣tavo) of an Enquiry into the Opinions of the Christian Writers of the three first Centuries con∣cerning
<PB N="350" REF="351"/>
the Person of Jesus Christ, which reaches to the conclusion of the apostolic age, and which was not followed by more volumes for want of encouragement; a Thanksgiving Sermon preached at Richmond, in 1784; the Poems of Mr. Gray, with Notes, in an octavo volume; the Georgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Virgil, with Notes, in an octavo volume; Re∣marks on Dr. Horsley's Ordination Sermon, pub∣lished in 1788; "Four Marks of Antichrist, or a Supplement to the Warburtonian Lecture, an ano∣nymous pamphlet; the Evidences of Christianity, a tract, which has seen two editions; <HI>Silva Critica sive in auctores sacros profanosque Commentarius Philo∣logus,</HI> Part I. published in 1789, a work which was discontinued on the completion of five parts (each an octavo volume), the first three of which were printed at the Cambridge press; an Address to the Inhabitants of Nottingham, relative to the Corpora∣tion and Test Acts, which was reprinted by the Birmingham Dissenters; a new Translation of those Parts only of the New Testament which are wrongly translated in our common Version; Cursory Reflections, relative to the Test Laws; an Address to Dr. Horsley, on occasion of a pamphlet relating to the Liturgy of the Church of England, ascri∣bed to him; a New Translation of the New Tes∣tament, published in 1791, in three octavo vo∣lumes, and since that time reprinted in two vo∣lumes; an Enquiry into the Expediency and Pro∣priety of Public or Social Worship, a pamphlet,
<PB N="351" REF="352"/>
which has seen three editions; Memoirs of the first thirty-six Years of his own Life, in an octavo vo∣lume; Short Strictures on Dr. Priestley's Letters to a Young Man, concerning Mr. Wakefield's Trea∣tise on Public Worship; a General Reply to the Arguments against the Enquiry into Public Wor∣ship; the Spirit of Christianity compared with the Spirit of the Times, a pamphlet, published in 1794; Answers to both Parts of Paine's Age of Reason; Remarks on the General Orders of the Duke of York to his Army, on June 7th, 1794, respecting the Decree of the French Convention to give no quarter to the British and Hanoverians; Vol. I. (in octavo) of the Works of Alexander Pope, Esq. with Notes, the commencement of a design which was afterward relinquished to Dr. War∣ton, and completed by Mr. Wakefield, only so far as by the publication of another octavo volume, consisting of Observations on the remaining Poems of Pope; a very elegant edition of Horace, in two duodecimo volumes; <HI>Tragoediarum Graecarum de'ec∣tus,</HI> in two volumes, octavo; Poetical Translations from the Ancients, in a duodecimo volume; a very beautiful edition of Bion and Moschus, with Notes, in a duodecimo volume; a Reply to Burke's Let∣ter to a Noble Lord; a very elegant edition of the Works of Virgil, in two duodecimo volumes; a new edition of Pope's Illiad and Odyssey, with Notes, critical and illustrative, in eleven volumes, octavo; a Letter to Mr. Bryant, relative to his Dis∣sertation

<P>It was the intention of Mr. Wakefield, had not the sources of academical favour ben dried up, to have carried on his <HI>Silva Critica</HI> through the whole compass of ancient literature; uniting theological and classical learning, and illustrating the scriptures by light borrowed from the philology of Greece and Rome. His Translation of the New Testament is a very valuable performance; his edition of Pope's Illiad and Odyssey, a very complete and elegant publication; and his edition of Lucretius, upon the large paper, the handsomest book we almost ever recollect to have seen. He has also written, beside the pieces already enumerated, a very masterly Essay on the Origin of Alphabetical Characters, which was read to the Literary and Phi∣losophical Society of Manchester at two successive meetings, was the more immediate occasion of his being elected an honorary member of that Society, and has been inserted in the New Annual Register, and in the Scotch Encyclopaedia. It is likewise to be found, with additions and improvements, in the Memoirs of his Life. Mr. Wakefield is also an oc∣casional
<PB N="353" REF="354"/>
contributor to the Monthly and Gentle∣man's Magazines. To the former he, not long ago, sent two Letters particularly remarkable, in which he endeavours to do away a prejudice of considerable strength and standing respecting the elegance of the style of Hume.</P>
<P>In contemplating Mr. Wakefield's General Cha∣racter as an author, the first and highest commenda∣tion is due to his remarkable industry. It is this active principle that has enabled him, with a re∣pectable share of talent, to serve the truest interests of useful letters, with far greater effect than has commonly fallen to the lot of first-rate genius. His knowledge of Greek and Roman authors is ex∣tensive and accurate; and as a critic he possesses a spirit most penetrating and ardent. As an emen∣dator he is frequently ingenious, but, certainly, for the greater part, too bold. His Latin style as he himself acknowledges, savours more of the ex∣pressive energy of Quintilian, than of the magnifi∣cent volubility of Cicero. It is not a little surpri∣sing, and particularly to be lamented for the sake of Mr. Wakefield's credit, that, with such peculiar faculties for the enjoyment of classical studies, he should ever have forsaken that flowery path to share the grovelling walks of writers, infinitely his inferiors; relinquishing the loftiest distinctions of literary character, for a pitiful display of party-spi∣rit, or peculiarity of opinion. Some of his con∣troversial writings, theological as well as political,
<PB N="354" REF="355"/>
are peculiarly indecent for their violence and illi∣berality; and his disposition appears, upon these occasions, to such disadvantage that his unpopula∣rity seems a necessary consequence. His English style is always manly and graceful, and, sometimes, peculiarly elegant and energetic: most readers will, however, object to his superabundant use of classical quotations. His numerous writings have for the greater part experienced an indifferent re∣ception, and some of them, particuliarly the earlier ones, have been severely handled by the critics of their day.</P>

<HEAD>WALCOT, JOHN, ESQ. M.D.</HEAD>
<P>Better known by his assumed name, PETER PINDAR. This comical genius is descended from, a respectable family in Devonshire, was bred to the study of physic, and practised for some time, with success, in the county of Cornwall. He af∣terward followed the fortunes of his friend, the late Sir William Trelawney to Jamaica, and became Physician General to the Island. It is said that during his residence there, he was induced, upon a prospect of important preferment, to assume the clerical function; but, that being disappointed in his views, he resigned that office before his return, to England, and has never since resumed it. On his arrival here he pursued his original profession, for several years, but, at last relinquished it entirely. It is to be recorded to the credit of Dr. Wal∣cot's benevolence as well as discernment, that the art of painting is indebted to him for Mr. Opie. That artist was found by him in the Mines of Corn∣wall, where his genius first discovered itself to the Doctor, and he was encouraged by him to trust for his future fortune to the cultivation of his intel∣lectual capability.</P>
<P>Of his celebrated satirical pieces, the first was a poetical Epistle to the Reviewers, which appeared in the year 1778, and was followed by the first set
<PB N="356" REF="357"/>
of Lyric Odes to the Royal Academicians, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1782. These, and his numerous subsequent pro∣ductions were originally published separately in quarto pamphlets, and were, not long ago, pub∣lished in collection, in four octavo volumes, and likewise in three duodecimo volumes; after several surreptitious collections of them, printed in Ireland. Few, indeed, have been the writings which have suc∣ceeded in commanding so large a share of attention as the detached pieces of Mr. Peter Pindar! Such was the demand for them, that a certain number of the London booksellers agreed to allow him two hundred pounds per annum, for the exclusive privilege of sel∣ling his works! They are characterised by a species of humour, which, though not elegant and tasteful, is not destitute of nature, and is irresistible in its power of exciting laughter. We consider BOZZY AND PIOZZI, THE LOUSIAD, and PINDARIANA as the best among them; but have never contem∣plated the character of this writer without a mix∣ture of surprize and concern, that such talents and attainments as his writings discover him to possess, should never have been applied to better purposes than to a Iudicrous display of his contempt of all decent respect, and to the composition of such trifles, as must inevitably perish with the age in which they were written.</P>

<P>Warden of Winchester College, and brother to the late celebrated poet laureat. A literary veteran of the greatest distinction. We believe the earliest of his publications was an Ode on reading West's Pindar, which appeared in 1749, and has been fol∣lowed by some other short poetical pieces, among which is the Enthusiast, or Lover of Nature. A year or two after the above date, he first published, in four volumes, octavo, the edition of Virgil, com∣monly known by the name of WARTON's AND PITT's VIRGIL; adding to Virgil's original text
<PB N="367" REF="368"/>
and Mr. Pitt's translation of the Aeneid, a new translation of the Eclogues and Georgics with Notes on the whole by himself, and dissertations Es∣says &amp;c. by himself and others. This edition of Virgil has been reprinted in four duodecimo vo∣lumes, as well as in octavo; and bears a very re∣spectable estimation among learned men. With the merit of Mr. Pitt's Version of the Aeneid the world is well acquainted. Of Dr. Warton's Eclo∣gues and Georgics it may be said, that they con∣vey the sense of their originals with greater exact∣ness and perspicuity than any other translation we have; that their vesification is easy and harmonious and their style correct and pure: yet, if read for themselves, they are inferior as pleasing poems to the similar performances of Dryden. About the same time with this publication, appeared also the first volume (in octavo) of Dr. Warton's cele∣brated Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope. It was published anonymously, and the second vo∣lume did not make its appearance till 1782, though part of it was printed nearly twenty years before that time. This work, though not always in harmony with later opinions, is abundantly gratifying on ac∣count of its learning, information, and just taste. In 1797, Dr. Warton committed to the public the labour, as it is said, of sixteen years, in his long looked-for Edition of the Works of Pope, printed in in nine octavo volumes. The expectation which this work had excited in the literary world, was, in
<PB N="368" REF="369"/>
some measure, disappointed on its appearance. It is one of the handsomest books which the modern elegance of typography has produced; but it is deformed by marks of haste, unpardonable in such an undertaking, and the commentary is little more than a selection of the best of Warburton's notes, combined with the corresponding parts of the edi∣tor's before-mentioned ESSAY. Yet, though not so excellent a work of the kind as might be wished for, it is certainly the best edition of Pope we have!</P>

<HEAD>WATSON, RIGHT REV. RICHARD, D.D. F.R.S.</HEAD>
<P>Lord Bishop of Landaff, Archdeacon of Ely, Rector of Carstil in Leicestershire, and Regius Pro∣fessor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge. A prelate distinguished for his various and extensive learning. His Lordship was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, was admitted to the degree of B. A. with distinguished credit, in the year 1759, afterward became Prefessor of Chemistry in the University, and was elected to his present Pro∣fessorship in 1771. During a residence of more than thirty years, he remained the glory of his Uni∣versity; at one time, by the ingenuity of his che∣mical researches; at another, as the pride of her divinity-chair. Of his Lordship's publications, the first was <HI>Institutiones Metallurgicae,</HI> a tract, printed
<PB N="370" REF="371"/>
at Cambridge, in 1768, and intended as a text∣book for that part of his chemical lectures, which explained the properties of metallic substances. He wrote six more chemical tracts during his resi∣dence in the University, the greater part of which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions; and they were all afterward reprinted in the fifth volume of his Chemical Essays. His Lordship next published an Assize Sermon, preached at Cambridge, in 1769: which was followed by two Sermons preached at the same place, in the year 1776, the publica∣tion of which first made him known beyond the precincts of the University; one of them, entitled, "The Principles of the Revolution vindicated," de∣livered on the 29th of May; the other on the An∣niversary of his Majesty's Accession in that year. These discourses, according to the sentiments of their respective readers, were subjects of high commendation on one side, and of severe disappro∣bation on the other. In the same year Dr. Watson also published, "An Apology for Christianity." a duodecimo volume, consisting of a series of letters to Mr. Gibbon; which, of all the answers made to the attacks of that gentleman, was the most libe∣ral, the most elegant, and, perhaps, the most for∣cible. It is seldom, indeed, that controversy has been conducted with so much becoming urbanity, and, at the same time, with so much spirit, as upon this occasion. In 1780, Dr. Watson pub∣lished a Sermon, preached before the University
<PB N="371" REF="372"/>
on the General Fast, Feb. 4th, which was greatly admired; and also a Discourse delivered to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Ely. The year following produced the two first volumes (in duo∣decimo) of those "Chemical Essays" which have been so highly approved, and to which three more volumes were afterward added. They were writ∣ten, not with a view of giving a System of Che∣mistry to the world, but to convey, in a popular manner, a general kind of knowledge to persons not much versed in chemical enquiries.</P>
<P>Having been tutor to the late Duke of Rutland, while His Grace resided at Cambridge, Dr. Watson was appointed, through the interest of the Rut∣land family, under the administration of the Mar∣quis of Lansdown, in 1782, to the Bishopric of Landaff. Immediately upon his promotion, his Lordship published a Letter to the (late) Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, recommending a new dispo∣sition of the church revenues, by which the Bi∣shoprics should be rendered equal to each other in value, and the smaller livings be so far increased in income, by a proportional deduction from the richer endowments, as to render them a decent competency. This letter produced several pam∣phlets at the press, among which was a Letter to the Bishop from Mr. Richard Cumberland (vide that name). Dr. Watson's subsequent publica∣tions have been, beside a few occasionial single Ser∣mons, a valuable Collection of Theological Tracts,
<PB N="372" REF="373"/>
in six large octavo volumes, published in 1785; an octavo volume of Sermons and Tracts, published in 1788, and consisting chiefly of his smaller pieces which had been published separately before that time, as already enumerated; three Charges deli∣vered to the Clergy of the Diocese of Landaff; an Address to young Persons after Confirmation, a pamphlet, which had been annexed to the first of his Charges; Considerations on the Expediency of Revising the Liturgy and Articles of the Church of England, a pamphlet, published in 1790; and "An Apology for the Bible," in answer to Paine's AGE OF REASON, Part II. Among these, his Lord∣ship's Sermon for the Westminster Dispensary, preached in 1785, and published with an excel∣lent Appendix, in 1793; as well as his most season∣able, strong, judicious, and beautiful APOLOGY for the Bible, are peculiarly entitled to commendation.</P>
<P>As a writer, Dr. Watson has united with almost unexampled grace, the knowledge of a scholar with the liberality of a gentleman, the warm piety of a true christian, and the open manliness of a well-intending character. It has been said, perhaps, with truth, that he is not a stranger to the pride of rank, that he is not deaf to the whispers of am∣bition, and that he feels with anguish the mortifi∣cation of disappointment: he has, moreover, ren∣dered himself not a little conspicuous by his oppo∣sition to the measures of administration. Yet, whatever delinquencies his detractors may have
<PB N="373" REF="374"/>
discovered, none can, with truth, deny that his de∣portment, in the course of a long, an active, and a conspicuous life, has been marked by the charac∣teristics of a very superior mind.</P>

In 1772, Mr. Whitaker published "The genuine History of the Britons asserted," an octavo volume, in refutation of Macpherson's INTRODUCTION TO THE HIS∣TORY OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND; and in which he displayed an evident superiority over his adversary. His next publication was a small octavo volume of Sermons upon Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell, which was printed in 1783, and has been generally thought to have added little to his reputation as an author. This was followed in 1787, by his three octavo volumes, entitled, "Mary Queen of Scots vindicated," which closed the controversy respecting that Princess, by a vindi∣cation of her innocence. Although Mr. Whitaker had been preceded on the same side of the ques∣tion, by the researches of Mr. Goodal, the acute∣ness of Mr. Tytler, and, above all, by the genius of Dr. Gilbert Stuart, he found means to discover some new materials for the defence of his heroine. The <HI>matter,</HI> indeed, of this publication is excellent throughout, but the <HI>manner</HI> is often highly repre∣hensible. The subsequent productions of Mr. Whit∣aker have been, a Review of Mr. Gibbon's History, Vols. IV. V. and VI. which had originally ap∣peared in the English Review; "The Origin of Arianism disclosed," a large controversial tract in which there is an uncommon display of learning and judgement; "The Course of Hannibal over the Alps ascertained," a very curious investigation, in
<PB N="378" REF="379"/>
two octavo volumes; and "The real Origin of Go∣vernment," a very singular pamphlet. Mr. Whit∣aker was also a very material contributor to the re∣putation which the English Review could, at one time, boast; and has written some Poems in the Collection published by Gentlemen of Devonshire and Cornwall. His vices as a writer are, a general inequality, and an occasional appearance of exces∣ssive affectation, in his style; too strong a propen∣sity to conjectural reasoning; and, sometimes, too apparent a self-satisfaction in his own performances. For these we are, however, compensated by his many virtues.</P>

<HEAD>WHITE, REV. JOSEPH, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>Archbishop Laud's Professor of Arabic in the University of Oxford, and Fellow of Wadham College. A gentleman of very distinguished ta∣lents and attainments. His first publication was, <HI>De Utilitate Linguae Arabicae in Studiis Theologicis,</HI> an oration delivered in 1775, on his appointment to his Professorship, and published the year following. He next printed a Sermon, recommending a Revi∣sal of the English Translation of the Old Testament, preached before the University in 1778; which was soon afterward followed by an edition of the Sy∣riac Philoxenian Version of the four Gospels, in a quarto volume, with a Latin Translation, by him∣self. In 1780, Dr. White presented the Public with "A Specimen of the Civil and Military Insti∣tutes of Timour, or Tamerlane," a work, written originally by that celebrated conqueror in the Mo∣gul Language, afterward translated into Persian, and rendered from the Persian into English, by the Doctor, from a MS. in the possession of Dr. Wil∣liam Hunter. This quarto pamphlet was followed, three years afterward, by a quarto volume of Insti∣tutes, Political and Military, written originally in the Mogul Language, by the Great Timour, tran∣slated from the Persian by Major Davy, and pub∣lished with the Persian translation, a preface, in∣dexes,
<PB N="380" REF="381"/>
notes, &amp;c. by Dr. White. His celebrated volume of Sermons, preached at the Bampton Lec∣ture made its first appearance in 1784, the year in which they were delivered. These discourses, con∣taining a view of Christianity and Mahometanism in their history, their evidence and their effects, Have obtained the most unbounded applauses of the lite∣rary world for their learning, their strength, and their beauty of composition: in point of eloquence and energy of style, we know of no happier speci∣mens in our language, It afterward appeared that these Sermons owed much of their excellence to the assistance given in their composition, by the late Rev. Mr. Samuel Badcock. Dr. White was openly attacked with a charge to this purpose, by Dr. Gabriel of the Octagon Chapel, Bath; and a literary controversy ensued which produced several pamphlets at the press. Dr. White was, at length, induced to publish a statement of the case, by which it appeared that literary and pecuniary obli∣gations had reciprocally subsisted between Mr. Badcock and himself; and that the Sermons had received additional brilliancy from the masterly pen of Dr. Parr. It is said that Dr. White has been, for some time, engaged in writing a History of Egypt.</P>

The favourable re∣ception which this volume experienced on its first appearance, was, probably, owing to the celebrity of its author's name.

<HEAD>WILLIAMS, DAVID.</HEAD>
<P>A native of Glamorganshire. He was originally a dissenting minister at Exeter and afterward preached for many years to a small congregation at Highgate. Here he changed his principles, and,
<PB N="385" REF="386"/>
being suspected, relinquished the ministerial charge and adopted that of private tuition. While at Highgate, he preached a course of Sermons on Re∣ligious Hypocrisy, which he published in two duo∣decimo volumes. In 1770, he wrote a poignant Letter to Mr. Garrick, on his conduct and talents, as manager and performer; which was followed by polemical dialogues, entitled "The Philosopher." When the Unitarian Clergy met at the Feathers Tavern to petition relief from subscribing the Arti∣cles, the able pen of Mr. Williams was solicited in their service; he accordingly drew up some Essays on Public Worship, Projects of Reformation, &amp;c. which were found to contain sentiments of so DEISTICAL a complexion that he was, at once, for∣saken by the people whom he had designed to serve. These Essays he published, and afterward added to them an Appendix, principally levelled at the Dissenters, upon whose conduct he was pe∣culiarly severe. Mr. Williams now totally forsook the connection of the Dissenters, and became an avowed advocate of deism, as well as of democracy. In 1774, the time of his establishing a private se∣minary at Chelsea, he published a Treatise on Edu∣cation, in a duodecimo volume, which contains some uncommonly acute and judicious remarks on that subject, while it too fully discloses the change in his principles with respect to revealed religion. Two years after this date, Mr. Williams opened a Chapel in Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, on
<PB N="386" REF="387"/>
the universal principles of Natural Religion, a scheme to which he was instigated by Dr. Franklin. Dignified with the appellation, <HI>Priest of Nature,</HI> he officiated here for about four years, and thus finally terminated his existence in a clerical capacity; hav∣ing subsequently employed his talents, which are unquestionably great, chiefly in the composition of political and deistical writings. Beside the works already mentioned, he has published a Sermon, preached at the opening of his Chapel in Margaret Street; a Liturgy for that Chapel; "The Na∣ture and Extent of Intellectual Liberty," a pam∣phlet; a Plan of Association on Constitutional Principles, a pamphlet written at the time of the riots in London; Letters on Political Liberty, oc∣casioned by the county meetings and associations in 1782; Lectures on Religion and Morality, in two volumes, quarto; Lectures on Education, in three volumes, octavo; Lectures on Political Prin∣ciples, in an octavo volume; and a History of Monmouthshire, in a quarto volume. Mr. Wil∣liams is also understood to be the author of "Royal Recollections," a most indecent satire upon his Majesty; "Lessons to a young Prince;" "An Apology for professing the Religion of Na∣ture in the eighteenth Century;" and the Pam∣phlets of Mr. Swainson.

In 1788, Miss Williams published a Poem on the Slave-trade Bill; and, two years afterward, a well written novel, entitled, "Julia." She went to France, for the second time, in the year 1791, and has, since then, resided at Paris. In the year of her departure, she published a Farewell to Eng∣land, a poem; which has been followed by "Let∣ters from France," relative to the Revolution, in two duodecimo volumes; Letters sketching the Politics of France, from May 31st, 1793, to July 28th, 1794, in four duodecimo volumes; and a Translation of Bernardin.

Mr. Young returned to England in the winter of the same year, and attended the Wool Bill then before our Parliament, after which he made a se∣cond tour to France, and finished his travels in 1789.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Young's publications, the first was an octavo volume, entitled, "The Farmer's Letters, &amp;c." which appeared in 1767, and to which a se∣cond volume was, some years afterward, added. His subsequent productions have been, "A six weeks Tour through the Southern Counties of Eng∣land and Wales," in an octavo volume; an Essay

on the Management of Hogs; a six-months Tour through the North of England, in four volumes, octavo; the Farmer's Guide in Hiring and Stock∣ing Farms, in two volumes, octavo; "Rural Oeco∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my," an octavo volume; a Course of Experi∣mental Agriculture, in two volumes, quarto; the Farmer's Tour through the East of England, in four volumes, octavo; "Political Arithmetic," Parts I. and II. pamphlets; a Tour in Ireland, first published in a quarto volume, and afterward reprinted in two volumes, octavo; Annals of Agri∣culture, in ten volumes, octavo; Travels in France, in two volumes, quarto; "The Example of France a Warning to Britain," an excellent and highly seasonable pamphlet, published in 1793, and which was the origin of the establishment of our Yeomanry Cavalry; an Idea of the <HI>present</HI> State of France, a pamphlet, published in 1795; and "The Constitution Safe without Reform,' a pamphlet.</P>
<P>Though the agricultural pursuits of Mr. Young have been highly laudable, his publications in this class have not been flattered with a recep∣tion peculiarly kind, and his judgement on those subjects has been frequently disapproved. In <HI>poli∣tical arithmetic</HI> he has deservedly gained considerable eminence; and his TRAVELS in France, in which his pursuit was not agriculture, but political oeco∣nomy, have been very eagerly read and highly approved.</P>

<HEAD>YOUNG, SIR WILLIAM, BART. M.P. F.R.A.S.</HEAD>
<P>Son of the late Lieutenant-governor of Domi∣nica, and grandson of the late Dr. Brook Taylor. He published, in 1777, "The Spirit of Athens," in an octavo volume; and, in 1786, the same work considerably enlarged, under the title, "The History of Athens Political and Philosophically considered," in a quarto volume. The style of this work is incorrect, complicated, and uncouth, but it is full of imagination, reflexion, and vi∣gour. In 1788, Sir William Young published a pamphlet on Mr. Gilbert's proposed Amendment of the Poor Laws; and he has written, since that time, "The Rights of Englishmen," a pamphlet; and a Letter to Mr. Pitt on the subject of Poor Houses and Work Houses. A Speech on the Slave-trade, deliverd by him in Parliament, in 1791, has also reached the press; and he has edited, and prefixed a Life of the author, to <HI>Con∣templatio Philosophica,</HI> a posthumous work of Dr. Brook Taylor, printed in an octavo volume, but not published.</P>
