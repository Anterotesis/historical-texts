<HEAD>A Brief Survey OF THE <HI REND="blackletterType">Legal Liberties</HI> OF THE <HI>Dissenters,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is no Time now to make Flou∣rishes, and lay down Aphorisms to debate upon: Matters of Fact must speak themselves; and that they may do so, let us bringthem together.</P>
<P>The <HI>Toleration</HI> was granted to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> at the Beginning of the Revolution; he that told us, <HI>It was not a Courtesy, but a Capitula∣tion, the Performance of an Agreement,</HI> not <HI>an Act of meer Tenderness and Charity,</HI> said True, or he said False; for my Part, I never heard him Confuted, or much said to contradict it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
If the <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Dissenters</HI> was a Grant of meer Charity and Mercy, yet it was no other Charity and Mercy than the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> as Christians, were obliged to shew: Persecution for Conscience being contrary to the Principles of the <HI>Christian Religion;</HI> and if they were oblig'd to grant it, they are equally oblig'd to continue it, unless they can alledge, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> have done any Thing to forfeit it, which we challenge all the <HI>Tories</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> to prove.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Dissenters</HI> was a Capitu∣lation, all Capitulations ought to be perform'd; all Agreements ought to be executed; and it is as much their Right to demand the Preser∣ving of it, as it was to demand the Enacting it.</P>
<P>But the Queen, besides all this, has pro∣mis'd to continue it, and to preserve it <HI>Inviol∣ably;</HI> we doubt not Her Majesty meant to do so when She said it, and means so still: But what mean they who would oblige Her, or perswade Her to break Her Word?</P>
<P>We do not say the Parliament offer this; and we doubt not but some People flatter them∣selves, that all these Things are not only Con∣sistent with, but will be Effectual for the <HI>Invi∣olable</HI> Preservation of the <HI>Toleration;</HI> we shall see presently how it will be prov'd.</P>
<P>The Managers of Persecuting Principles have very pretty Ways with them to cover and guild over the most effectual Measures of De∣stroying us, with fair Pretences of Preserving us. Perhaps this Taking away the Schools and Academies of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> is done the better to preserve, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Inviolably.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
We find in the first Section of the last <HI>Occa∣sional Bill,</HI> the Enacting Clauses thus Introdu∣ced, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now for the better Securing the said Church, <HI>so far is Good,</HI> and Quieting the Minds of Her Majesty's <HI>Protestant</HI> and <HI>Dis∣senting</HI> Subjects, and Rendering them Secure in the Exercise of their Religious Worship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Be it Enacted</HI></P>
<P>I do not say, That the Bill following those Words, did abridge the said <HI>Dissenters</HI> of any of their Liberties, in the Exercise of their Re∣ligious Worship: But this I will say, That if the <HI>Dissenters</HI> were so abridg'd by that Act, then joining the Words together, it will follow, <HI>That their said Liberties were so abridg'd, the better to Quiet their Minds, and for the Securing them in the Exercise of their Religious Worship;</HI> perhaps other Laws may be Bless'd with the like Congruity.</P>
<P>Before we go on to Examine what may, or not be deem'd an Attempt upon, and Inconsi∣stent with the <HI>Religious Liberties</HI> of the <HI>Dissen∣ters,</HI> it may be very useful for us to enquire what those <HI>Liberties</HI> really are; to which Pur∣pose, and that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> may know how far those <HI>Liberties</HI> do or do not extend, and when they are or are not Invaded, I believe it very much to the present Purpose to publish the said <HI>Toleration Act</HI> at large, which, altho' it be put at the End of this Tract, the Reader is desir'd to turn to it, and Peruse it before he goes on any farther.</P>
<P>HAVING now Suppos'd, that the Readers of this Tract have Perus'd the Act of <HI>Toleration</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
deliberately, and have thereby a clear Account of what the <HI>Dissenters</HI> Liberties really are, it will be also Necessary to let them see what it is that the present Depending Bill is to Enact against them, and so we shall presently judge about the Word <HI>INVIOLABLY,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is true, and this is the great Pretence of those who promote this Matter, That the keep∣ing of Schools and Academies for the Instruc∣ting and Educating our Children, is not ex∣presly a Part of the <HI>Toleration Bill;</HI> And there∣fore say they, The <HI>Toleration</HI> may be Inviol∣ably <HI>preserv'd, notwithstanding the Passing the present Bill</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Dissenters</HI> will refute this by alledg∣ing, That the Liberty of Teaching and In∣structing our Children, is such an Essential, in the <HI>Meaning</HI> of a <HI>Toleration,</HI> that it needs no more to be express'd therein, than a Liberty of going out of our own Houses, or rising out of our Beds, and putting on our Clothes, in Order to a religious Assembly, need to be ex∣press'd in that Part of the Act which allows Places to be appointed for that Worship.</P>
<P>If any essential Part of the <HI>Toleration</HI> be ta∣ken away, altho' not express'd, how is the <HI>Toleration</HI> then preserv'd <HI>Inviolably?</HI></P>
<P>Farther, the educating of Children is a Part of the religious Duties of a Christian, and a∣mong these of the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> more e∣specially regarded as such: If the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are abridg'd of what is their indispensible Duty, they are persecuted in the most extreme Sense of Persecution; For the Consequence is, they must offend against this Law, because they are
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
bound <HI>to obey GOD rather than Man.</HI> In of∣fending this Law they must incur a Penalty; not being able to pay the Penalty, they must go to Prison, and in Prison they must perish: So that in Consequence of this Law, the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> will suffer <HI>Death</HI> for their Religion, and and yet the <HI>Toleration</HI> be preserved INVIO∣LABLE.</P>
<P>I think the Plainness of this Case is not to be found Fault with, Religion is nothing more or less than a Serving or Worshipping GOD, our Maker and Lawgiver. The Method is prescrib'd by His <HI>Word; Conscience</HI> is to every Man the Judge of his own Duty, and the Man∣ner of Performing is this, Conscience is a So∣vereign Dictator in the Mind of Men, and it must be obey'd; So it is not meet to make Laws to restrain it, human Power having no judicial Right over it.</P>
<P>As then Conscience must be obey'd, in which the Scripture is clear, <HI>Whether it be lawful to obey GOD rather than Man, judge ye?</HI> When Laws are made restraining us to such Things as Conscience forbids to do, or commands not to omit, what must we do?</P>
<P>The Answer is plain, <HI>We must suffer.</HI> True, but then we must say, <HI>That this is</HI> PERSECU∣TION: If then <HI>Persecution</HI> is contrary to the <HI>Principles</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> as we have the Authority of Parliament, in the Preamble to the <HI>first occasional Bill,</HI> to prove; what fol∣lows? But that every <HI>persecuting Act</HI> is an <HI>Un∣christian Act.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the present depending Bill be a Persecuting, and consequently an unchristian still, let others judge; this Deponent faith not.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
It may however be of some Use to enquire into some of the Consequences which the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> may expect from this Law, that those who are to suffer by it, may prepare their Minds for <HI>Martyrdom;</HI> and they who are to pass it, may consider what <HI>Ruin</HI> of <HI>Families,</HI> what <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Conscientious Sufferers,</HI> what <HI>Encrease</HI> of <HI>Igno∣rance,</HI> and consequently of <HI>Error,</HI> they are go∣ing to be the Cause of; and what terrible Havock they are going to make in the <HI>Reforma∣tion,</HI> which has Enemies enough, and Wounds enough already. Perhaps when these Things come to be seriously reflected upon, they may consider.</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Persecution</HI> is thus reviv'd, what must the <HI>Dissenters</HI> do? <HI>Negatively,</HI> I'll tell you what they <HI>cannot do.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. They cannot say their <HI>Toleration</HI> is IN∣VIOLABLY preserv'd: They that think this Bill does not interfere with the <HI>Toleration,</HI> may here compare them together; The one says, <HI>Ease is to be given to tender Consciences;</HI> The o∣ther says, <HI>The tenderest Consciences shall be op∣prest;</HI> one says, <HI>The</HI> Dissenters <HI>shall have Liber∣ty to assemble, and their Children may worship GOD with them:</HI> The other says, <HI>They shall not have School-masters to instruct them how to Worship;</HI> one gives them a Liberty of <HI>professing their Dis∣sent;</HI> The other denies them the Liberty of <HI>being Taught to know why they dissent:</HI> This is the ready Way indeed to make <HI>Dissenting</HI> be a <HI>Faction</HI> in the next Age, as they pretend it is now <HI>not a religious Principle.</HI> Thus the <HI>Tole∣ration</HI> is <HI>preserv'd,</HI> and not <HI>preserv'd</HI> at the same Time. The <HI>Letter</HI> of the <HI>Toleration</HI> is preserv'd
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
in Deed, but the <HI>Substance</HI> and <HI>essential Parts</HI> are destroy'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. They cannot say, they are kindly treated by the Church; and when they look back upon their own Conduct to the Church, they tell them plainly, <HI>they have not deserv'd this Usage at their Hands;</HI> When they rescued the Church from an evident Ruin in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time, mighty Promises of Temper and Tenderness were made them; let us suppose now the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> parting with them at that Time in this Manner, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">"<HI>Yes, yes,</HI> Gentlemen, you promise us fair now, while you are under Apprehen∣sions of the <HI>Popish Party.</HI> Now you call us <HI>Brethren,</HI> and talk well of the <HI>small</HI> Differ∣ences between us; and how Charity ought to bury what is past, and to bind us closser for the Time to come, that you find now you have been mistaken, and that we are as <HI>faithful</HI> to the <HI>Protestant Interest</HI> as your selves; and you will for ever esteem us the <HI>same Christians</HI> as your Selves, allowing us a <HI>Legal</HI> establish'd Liberty, and living in <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> with us; will never more suffer the <HI>indifferent Things</HI> which are in Dispute among us to divide us. But when, by our Assis∣tance, you are establish'd again, you will for∣get all these Things. When a Generation rises up, <HI>That knows not</HI> Joseph, they will call us all <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> and <HI>Recusants</HI> again; Couple us with <HI>Papists,</HI> say we are <HI>Danger∣ous</HI> to the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Enemies</HI> to <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and make new Laws against us, destroy the <HI>Toleration</HI> you now offer us, and <HI>persecute</HI> us as bad as ever.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
When the <HI>Dissenter</HI> says thus to them, Suppose a certain Grave Divine stands up and Quotes the Words of <HI>Hasael</HI> the King of <HI>Assyria, Is thy Servant a Dog, that be should do this thing?</HI> What now would that Grave Divine say, <HI>for the Passage is not a Fable,</HI> if he were to see this Bill passing the House? would he Plead, that <HI>this is not Persecution?</HI></P>
<P>The Question is not only upon the word <HI>Persecution,</HI> tho' that is answer'd plain e∣nough too: But is it <HI>Just?</HI> Is it <HI>Kind?</HI> Is it <HI>Grateful?</HI> Is it <HI>Agreeable</HI> to former Pretences? Is it what was <HI>Solemnly Promised,</HI> when the <HI>Church</HI> stood in need of the Assistance and Sup∣port of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> in the time of their Ex∣tremity? Is this the Performance of So∣lemn Engagement to the <HI>Dissenters?</HI> Is this the <HI>Temper</HI> you promis'd to come to? Is this the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> you resolv'd to live in? Monstrous! Perfidious!</P>
<P N="3">3. They cannot say, they are not <HI>Persecuted;</HI> Persecution is the <HI>Constraining</HI> and <HI>Restraining Conscience</HI> by Force and Punishment. To <HI>Restrain from</HI> what we dare not <HI>Omit,</HI> is as much Persecution, as to <HI>Constrain</HI> to what we dare not <HI>Comply with.</HI> Can any <HI>Christian</HI> Omit Instructing his Children in the <HI>Christian Religi∣on? Dare</HI> any <HI>Dissenter</HI> Educate his Child in that Way which he dares not Conform to himself? Is not that Condemning himself, and Abandoning his Child? Does he not, by that single Act, either declare that he <HI>Dissents</HI> without any Foundation, or that he Values not the <HI>Salvation</HI> of his Child?</P>
<P>Conscientious <HI>Dissenters</HI> have never yet shewn
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
such an Indifferency in the Matter of Con∣formity; if they had, they could not have been suppos'd to Suffer such <HI>Hardships</HI> as they now do, to be expelled any Share either in the <HI>Trust, Honour,</HI> or <HI>Profits</HI> of their Country's Service.</P>
<P N="4">4. They cannot say, that they are at all oblig'd by this, to farther and future Services; and altho' it is true, that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> may not withdraw their Hands from the Necessary Services of their Country, as <HI>English Men,</HI> yet all those Voluntary Services, which, upon all Occasions, they have appear'd Freely and Generously to join in, they must now Restrain, in Order to carry on the more needful Ex∣pence of Educating and Instructing their Chil∣dren Abroad, and keeping Tutors for them in their own Houses, and in Assisting Poor Families to do the same.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Affirmative</HI> Consequences of their <HI>Persecution,</HI> which it is not so proper to Men∣tion, only I take the Freedom to tell these Warm People, that there will not one <HI>Dissen∣ter</HI>'s Child the more be brought up in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> by this <HI>Persecuting Act;</HI> neither will this Lessen, but Encrease the <HI>Schism,</HI> and the Number of <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>En∣gland.</HI> It is true, it will straiten the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> in their Educating their Children, put them to Difficulties and Expence. As to the first, they must Suffer it, as an Effect of <HI>Perse∣cution:</HI> And as to the last, the Money wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch the <HI>Dissenters</HI> now freely▪ Contribute to the <HI>Church,</HI> over and above what the Law demands, <HI>(viz.)</HI> on Subscription to <HI>Charities,</HI> to <HI>Lectu∣rers,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
to <HI>Poor Clergy,</HI> to <HI>Briefs,</HI> &amp;c. Which it would be the greatest Madness in the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI> not to Restrain: These, I say, will Pay all the Difference in the Expence of the Edu∣cation of their Children, and assist them to Educate the Poor that cannot do it them∣selves.</P>
<P>Again, seeing the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> are so Sensible of the Effect of our Schoolmasters Teaching the <HI>Dissenters</HI> Children the <HI>Assem∣blies</HI> Catechism, that they should make a Law that they shall not be Instructed in that man∣ner at School, it is a Warm Admonition to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to Revive the Ancient Family Discipline and Instruction, which was the O∣riginal Method by which the Reformation was begun in this Nation; and by duly Catechi∣sing their own Children and Servants, and giving Catechises to the Poor Families that want them, effectually supply the Deffect; and thus the End of these <HI>Church Christians</HI> (viz.) to lessen <HI>Christian Knowledge,</HI> instead of encreasing it, shall be Defeated, till they think fit to make another Bill to take the <HI>Dis∣scurers</HI> Children away from them, as the <HI>Pa∣pists</HI> did to the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> or as the <HI>Mahometans</HI> do now to the <HI>Armenian</HI> Christians <HI>Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> to make Janizaries.</P>
<P>Besides this, the <HI>Inhumanity</HI> of this Law, which admits of a large Description, and which has many Branches Tending to <HI>Cruelty,</HI> cannot but fill the Minds of our Posterity with Abhorrence of the Church it self, and so make the Breach wider than ever it was before: As all the Sangninary Laws against the Refor∣mation,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
and against the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> could never stop the Progress either of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion at first, or of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion afterwards, so neither will this, but will Confirm, Establish, and Encrease the Bo∣dy of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in this Nation. To con∣clude all,</P>
<P>The Methods which will also be still less to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to evade this Act, will of Course have one of these two Effects; either, which we earnestly wish, it will cause the Church to see the Mistake, and Repeal the Rigorous Law; or, as those who run into many Evils, to Support, and rather than Recant the first, it will oblige them to such other and farther Steps of this Kind, as must revive the severest Perse∣cutions, even to Death and Torture; the Con∣sequences we may reasonably expect will end in Judgment from Heaven, and the Confusion of the Nation.</P>
<P>We cannot but hope that these Things may prevail with our Legislators to consider what is before them, and to examine as well the <HI>Political</HI> as the <HI>Christian</HI> Arguments which may be offer'd to them against this <HI>Bill.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly, how it strikes at the Founda∣tion of Religion, as Christian, and tends to the Destroying the Light and Knowledge of Divine Things in the World, which is the Ho∣nour of the Reformation: Whereas, if the In∣struction of Children in the Knowledge of Re∣ligion is restrain'd, loaded with Difficulties, or limited, it is thereby discouraged, lessen'd and put backward, which is contrary to the Prac∣tice of all the <HI>Protestant Nations</HI> in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Neither is it enough to say, That the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> are the Cause of such Discouragement, for that they may send their Children to Learn the <HI>Church Catechism,</HI> and to <HI>Church Tutors</HI> and <HI>School-masters.</HI> For if the Dissenters can∣not in Conscience Conform, neither can they in Conscience teach their Children to Conform; and if that Principle, <HI>Conscience,</HI> obliges them to keep their Children without any Degree of Learning and Instruction, which they would otherwise have had; the Law that limits their Education to Terms which their Parents can∣not comply with, is the unrighteous Cause of that Defect, and thus Ignorance flows in of Course. It is to be hop'd, the <HI>Church of Eng∣land</HI> will not be thought to plant it self best in the Ignorance of the People. Christian Knowledge is the Fountain of the Reforma∣tion of the Christian Religion. <HI>Popery,</HI> indeed, may be said to be <HI>Founded</HI> in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>propagated</HI> in <HI>Superstition,</HI> which is the Child of Stupidity and Blindness. But <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and the Light of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> were the Nur∣ses and Founders of the Reformation; and Woe be to that Nation, or People, or Body of Men, who pretend to propagate the Christi∣an Religion by Restraining the Knowledge of Religion in the Minds of the Younger Part of the Nation, who it is their Duty by all possi∣ble Means to Instruct.</P>
<P>We find in the Heads of the <HI>Bill</HI> now De∣pending, some Things also more particularly Tending to Persecution than is yet mention'd <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Engaging every one who shall have a License to Teach School, never to be
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
present at a Meeting. This is Restraining the said Teacher, or Schoolmaster from his Liber∣ty of Conscience to preserve his Livelyhood, and making the Salary, or Gain of his Employ∣ment, to be a Snare to his Principles.</P>
<P>What the Fines and Penalties are; how Ri∣gorous the Prosecution; how the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are debarr'd from their Liberty of Appeal to Her Majesty's Superiour Courts of Justice, and left to the Mercy of the <HI>Justices</HI> of the <HI>Peace,</HI> without Appeal; and how to be prosecuted in <HI>Ecclesiastical Courts,</HI> where the Church-Men, who in this Cause are Parties, are made Judg∣es. As these Things are apparent in the <HI>Bill,</HI> so are they the Height of <HI>Persecution,</HI> unprece∣dented; and in their Nature, an Oppression of our Civil Rights as <HI>Englishmen.</HI></P>
<P>To close all. How these Things agree with the <HI>Toleration,</HI> is a Mystery I can by no Means reconcile. Perhaps those who read the <HI>Bills</HI> both together, and see how and where the Clau∣ses join, and where they part, may see less of Persecution than I can; and that all Men may do so, and judge for themselves, therefore are the Copies Published in this Manner.</P>

<P>THAT whereas by an Act of Parlia∣ment in the Thirteenth and Four∣teenth Years of his late Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, intituled, <HI>An Act for the Uniformity of Publick Prayers, and the Admi∣nistration of the Sacrament, and other Rites and Ceremonies; and for Establishing the Form of Making, Ordaining, and Consecrating Bishops, Priests and Deacons in the Church of</HI> England; it is among other Things enacted, that every School-master keeping any Publick or Pri∣vate School, and every Person Instructing and Teaching any Youth or Private Family, as a Tutor or School-master, should sub∣scribe before his or their Respective Bishop, or Arch-bishop, or Ordinary of the Diocess, a Declaration or Acknowledgment, in which among other Things is contained as follows,—<HI>viz </HI><Q>I <HI>A.

<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
<HEAD>QUERIES Humbly Propos'd to My LORDS the BISHOPS, upon Occasion of the BILL now Depending in the HOUSE of PEERS, to prevent (as is pleaded) <HI>The Growth of Schism.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Query</HI> I. HOW <HI>Schism</HI> can be prevented, before 'tis clearly determined what it is? And whether those Men canjustly be charged with it, who are united to the Com∣mon Head of the Christian Church by <HI>Faith,</HI> and to all its Members by an hearty <HI>Love?</HI> And whether Dissenters are not within the <HI>Church,</HI> as it is defin'd by the 19th Article of the <HI>Church of England;</HI> having <HI>the pure Word of God preach'd amongst them, and the Sacraments duly administred according to Christ's Ordinance, in all Things that of Necessity are requisite to the same?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. HOW any National Church, as far as it is favour'd or warranted by the Holy Scrip∣tures, which all Protestants own for their Rule, can be in any Real Danger from such Persons
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
as those describ'd, or from their being left at Liberty to Educate their Children in their own Way?</P>
<P N="3">III. WHETHER it be not a Piece of Wisdom to learn from our Enemies? And when even in the <HI>Romish</HI> Communion, notwithstanding their High Pretensions to <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity,</HI> there is yet a great Diversity admit∣ted amongst their Religious Orders, why should not <HI>Protestants</HI> inlarge and strengthen themselves, by enclosing All they can, in a Way of Forbearance, especially when they hearti∣ly fall in with the same Civil Government?</P>
<P N="4">IV. ARE not the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Prote∣stant Churches (to our great Satisfaction) al∣lowed to Educate their own Children, without Dishonour or Damage to the Church or State? And shall this Privilege be deny'd to Natives, that are Faithful and Peaceable, meerly be∣cause they are Dissenters?</P>
<P N="5">V. WHETHER the treating such as <HI>Schis∣maticks</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. (to look no farther back) was not sensibly found to promote the <HI>Growth of Popery?</HI> And whe∣ther it may not reasonably be expected, that a like Cause should have a like Effect?</P>
<P N="6">VI. WHETHER in the Reign that succeed∣ed, it was not own'd by some Eminent Prelates of the Church, with Archbishop <HI>Sancroft</HI> at their Head, as well as by the Noble Marquess of <HI>Halifax,</HI> in his <HI>Letter to the Dissenters,</HI> (in which so many eminent Persons concurred, and which all at that Time applauded,) that too much Rigour had been us'd towards Persons of the same Religion, for differing in smaller
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
Matters? And whether Promises were not then freely made, of a different Treatment and a better Temper for the Future, from the Pulpit and the Press, and in all Conversation?</P>
<P N="7">VII. WHETHER the Bishops that have been advanc'd to that Honour since the <HI>Revo∣lution,</HI> who have generally been Persons of the greatest Eminence for their Worth and Mo∣deration, have not met with more Respect from the Dissenters, than from many who pre∣tended to be zealous Members of their own Church? And whether it is a suitable Return for Persons of their Lordships Candour, to deal more hardly by us as to our Children, than their Predecessors ever attempted to do by our Fa∣thers, as to their Descendants?</P>
<P N="8">VIII. WHETHER any Thing more tender∣ly affected the Protestants in <HI>France,</HI> than the denying them Liberty to Educate their Chil∣dren in their own Principles? And whether that Method which has all along been repre∣sented as so severe in a <HI>Popish Prince,</HI> can ne∣ver be fit to be countenanced by <HI>Protestant Bi∣shops,</HI> in a <HI>Protestant Country?</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. WHETHER if <HI>Popery</HI> should once more prevail among us, which some who are Orna∣ments to the Bench of Bishops have owned to be no very remote Supposition, it would be a most grating Reflection when the Legislators should demand the Education of the Children of all <HI>Protestants,</HI> to hear them insinuate, That their Lordships had set them the Pattern, by demanding the Education of the Children of <HI>Dissenters?</HI></P>
<P N="10"><PB N="37" REF="36"/>
X. WHETHER it can reasonably be ex∣pected that they should ever have the Courage to endure the Fiery Trial, (which is what, ac∣cording to the foregoing Supposition they may be called to) who, by any Political Considera∣tions, should be kept from sheltring the Inno∣cent? And whether upon Supposition any Members of their own Church should threaten them, if they acted according to the Princi∣ples by which they obtained their Preferments, it would not be more becoming to inform them better, and yield more Comfort to set them an Example of Steadiness, than to harden and embolden them, by yielding to them in a Me∣thod of treating Brethren, that is neither Scrip∣tural nor Rational?</P>
<P N="11">XI. WHETHER it be seemly for Guides of the Church, to pass such a Censure upon the <HI>Assemblie</HI>'s <HI>Catechism,</HI> as if it were not fit to be Taught, when there is nothing to be found in it, but what agrees with the Doctrine, and nothing that is opposite to the Government of their own Church? And how it can be recon∣cil'd with the Honour and Veracity of their Lordships to allow no other Catechism than that, which cannot be answer'd to with Truth by the Children of Dissenters, who had no Godfathers or Godmothers to give them their Names, or promise for them?</P>
<P N="12">XII. WHETHER the <HI>Ecclesiastical Courts</HI> have not from the first Reformation been own'd a great Grievance by the best Prelates and Mem∣bers of the <HI>Church of England?</HI> Whether they have not upon Occasion been freely inveigh'd against, by many who are at present on the
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
Bishops bench? And, Whether there be any such Evidence of their Amendment, as can justify their now concurring to support and in courage them?</P>
<P>AND, Lastly, WHETHER the passing such a Bill into a Law, be not more likely to spread Animosity, increase Uncharitableness, and perpetuate Division, than prevent the Growth of what is call'd <HI>Schism?</HI> And, Whether this be not as evident, as that publickly branding a Body of Men, will inflame the Populace against them; and that Severity on the other Hand tends to exasperate the Sufferers?</P>
<P><HI>My Lords the Bishops are earnestly re∣quested to take these Things into their serious Consideration, by several of the Descendants of those very</HI> Pres∣byterians, <HI>who earnestly ( tho' in∣vain) implor'd the Compassion of their Predecessors in</HI> 1661; <HI>and by many that have join'd with them in waiting for the fulfilling their Pro∣mises in</HI> 1687 <HI>and</HI> 1688: <HI>And who most heartily beg of Almighty GOD, they may never fall into the same Ex∣tremities, or worse, by having our Common Hopes, which depend upon the Protestant Succession in the Illus∣trious House of</HI> HANOVER, <HI>defea∣ted, according to some Mens Desires and Wishes, which we pray may never take Effect.</HI></P>
