<L N="5">Their mingled streams her motley servants shed</L>
<L>On each bold Author's self-devoted head.</L>
<L>On thee, O GIBBON! in whose splendid page</L>
<L>ROME shines majestic 'mid the woes of age,</L>
<L>Mistaken Zeal, wrapt in a priestly pall,</L>
<L N="10">Has from the baser urn pour'd darkest gall:</L>
<L>These stains to Learning would a Bard efface</L>
<L>With tides of glory from the golden vase,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>But that he feels this nobler task require</L>
<L>A spirit glowing with congenial fire—</L>
<L N="15">A VIRGIL only may uncensur'd aim</L>
<L>To sing in equal verse a LIVY's fame:</L>
<L>Yet while Polemics, in fierce league combin'd,</L>
<L>With savage discord vex thy feeling mind;</L>
<L>And with a pure Religion's just defence,</L>
<L N="20">Blend gross detraction and perverted sense;</L>
<L>Thy wounded ear may haply not refuse</L>
<L>The soothing accents of an humbler Muse.</L>
<L>The lovely Science, whose attractive air</L>
<L>Derives new charms from thy devoted care,</L>

<L>Which reigns the idol of the Poet's heart.</L>
<L>Tho' sister Goddesses, thy guardian maid</L>
<L>Shines in the robe of fresher youth array'd,</L>
<L>Like PALLAS recent from the brain of JOVE,</L>
<L N="30">When Strength with Beauty in her features strove;</L>
<L>While elder Poesy, in every clime</L>
<L>The flower of earliest fall, has past her prime:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>The bloom, which her autumnal cheeks supply,</L>
<L>Palls on the Public's philosophic eye.</L>

<L>With humbler hopes, she wishes still to please</L>
<L>By moral elegance, and labour'd ease:</L>
<L>Like other Prudes, leaves Beauty's lost pretence,</L>
<L N="40">And strives to charm by Sentiment and Sense.</L>
<L>Yet deaf to Envy's voice, and Pride's alarms,</L>
<L>She loves the rival, who eclips'd her charms;</L>
<L>Safe in thy favour, she would fondly stray</L>
<L>Round the wide realm, which owns that Sister's sway,</L>

<L>In Egypt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 77 See NOTE V.</NOTE> once a dread tribunal stood;</L>
<L>Offspring of Wisdom! source of Public Good!</L>
<L>Before this Seat, by holy Justice rear'd,</L>
<L N="80">The mighty Dead, in solemn pomp, appear'd;</L>

<L>The hallow'd portals of the tomb were clos'd;</L>
<L>A sculptur'd form of Truth the Judges wore,</L>
<L>A sacred emblem of the charge they bore!</L>
<L N="85">The claims of Virtue their pure voice exprest,</L>
<L>And bade the opening grave receive its honor'd guest.</L>
<L>In such a court, array'd in Judgment's robe,</L>

<L>Age from her lesson forms its wisest aim,</L>
<L N="100">And youthful Emulation springs to Fame.</L>
<L>Yet thus adorn'd with noblest powers, design'd</L>
<L>To charm, correct, and elevate mankind,</L>
<L>From darkest Time her humble Birth she drew,</L>
<L>And slowly into Strength and Beauty grew;</L>
<L N="105">As mighty streams, that roll with gather'd force,</L>
<L>Spring feebly forth from some sequester'd source.</L>

<L>Keen Emulation, wrapt in trance sublime,</L>
<L N="120">Drinks with retentive ear the potent rhyme;</L>
<L>And faithful Memory, from affection strong,</L>
<L>Spreads the rich torrent of her martial song.</L>
<L>Letters at length arise; but envious Night</L>
<L>Conceals their blest Inventor from our sight.</L>
<L N="125">O'er the wide earth his spreading bounty flew,</L>
<L>And swift those precious seeds of Science grew;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>Thence quickly sprung the Annal's artless frame,</L>

<L>But in the center of those vast abodes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 131. See NOTE VII.</NOTE></L>
<L>Whose mighty mass the land of Egypt loads;</L>
<L>Where, in rude triumph over years unknown,</L>
<L>Gigantic Grandeur, from his spiry throne,</L>
<L N="135">Seems to look down disdainful, and deride</L>
<L>The poor, the pigmy toils of modern Pride;</L>
<L>In the close covert of those gloomy cells,</L>
<L>Where early Magic fram'd her venal spells,</L>
<L>Combining priests, from many an ancient tale,</L>
<L N="140">Wove for their hallow'd use Religion's veil;</L>
<L>A wondrous texture! supple, rich, and broad,</L>

<L>This, as her caestus, Superstition wore;</L>

<L>The Sorceress, to spread her empire, drest</L>
<L N="150">History's young form in this illusive vest,</L>
<L>Whose infant voice repeated, as she taught,</L>
<L>The motley fables on her mantle wrought;</L>
<L>Till Attic Freedom brought the Foundling home</L>
<L>From the dark cells of her Egyptian dome;</L>
<L N="155">Drew by degrees th' oppressive veil aside,</L>
<L>And, shewing the fair Nymph in nature's pride,</L>
<L>Taught her to speak, with all the fire of youth,</L>
<L>The words of Wisdom in the tone of Truth;</L>

<L>Inchanting Athens! oft as Learning calls</L>

<L>For while the mind, in study's toilsome hours,</L>

<L>The wealth of Virtue, and the fruits of Sense</L>
<L>These Poisons flow, collective and apart,</L>

<P><HI>Yet one excelling Greek,</HI> &amp;c.] Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the celebrated historian and critic of the Augustan age, who settled in Italy, as he himself informs us, on the close of the civil war. He has addressed a little treatise, containing a critique on the elder historians, to his friend Cnaeus Pompeius, whom the French cri∣tics
<PB N="86" REF="84"/>
suppose to be Pompey the Great; but Reiske, the last editor of Dionysius, has sunk him into a petty Greek grammarian, the client or freedman of that illustrious Roman.</P>
<P>In this treatise of Dionysius, and in one still longer, on the character of Thucydides, there are some excellent historical pre∣cepts, which Mr. Spelman has judiciously thrown together in the preface to his admirable translation of the Roman Antiquities.— He introduces them by the following observation, which may serve perhaps to recommend the subject of the present poem.— "So much has been said, both by the antients and the moderns, in praise of the advantages resulting from the study of History, parti∣cularly by Diodorus Siculus among the former, in the noble pre∣face to his Historical Collections; and by the late Lord Bolingbroke, among the moderns, in his admirable letter on that subject; that I am astonished no treatise has ever yet appeared in any age, or any language, professedly written to prescribe rules for writing History; a work allowed to be of the greatest advantage of all others to mankind, the repository of truth, fraught with lessons both of pub∣lic and private virtue, and enforced by stronger motives than pre∣cepts—by examples. Rules for Poetry and Rhetoric have been writ∣ten by many authors, both antient and modern, as if delight and eloquence were of greater consequence than instruction: however, Rhetoric was a part of History, as treated by the antients; not the principal part indeed, but subservient to the principal; and calcu∣lated to apply the facts exhibited by the narration. I know it may be said, that many antient histories are still preserved, and that these models are sufficient guides for modern Historians, with∣out particular rules: so had the Greeks Poets of all denominations in their hands, and yet Aristotle thought it necessary to prescribe particular rules to his countrymen for applying those examples to every branch of Poetry: I wish he had done the same in History; if he had, it is very probable that his precepts would have rendered
<PB N="87" REF="85"/>
the best of our modern Histories more perfect, and the worst, less abominable.—Since the resurrection of letters, the want of such a guide has been complained of by many authors, and particularly by Rapin, in the preface to his History of England."—Spelman, page 15. But this ingenious and learned writer speaks a little too strongly, in saying no treatise has ever appeared in any age or lan∣guage, containing rules for History. There is one in Latin by the celebrated Vossius, entitled Ars Historica; another by Hubertus Folieta, an elegant Latin writer, of the 16th century, on whom Thuanus bestows the highest commendation; and Mascardi, an Italian critic, patronised by Cardinal Mazarine, has written also dell Arte Historica. The curious reader may find a singular anec∣dote relating to the publication of this work in Bayle, under the article Mascardi. But to return to Dionysius, in comparing He∣rodotus and Thucydides. He censures the latter with a degree of severity unwarranted by truth and reason: indeed this severity ap∣peared so striking to the learned Fabricius, that he seems to consi∣der it as a kind of proof, that the critical works of Dionysius were composed in the hasty fervor of youth. They are however in gene∣ral, to use the words of the same ingenuous author, eximia &amp; lectu digna; and a valuable critic of our own country, who resembles Dionysius in elegance of composition, and perhaps in severity of judgment, has spoken yet more warmly in their favour.—See Warton's Essay on Pope, 3d edit. page 175.</P>

<P><HI>In Egypt once a dread tribunal stood.</HI>] This singular institution, which is alluded to by many of our late authors, is related at large in the First Book of Diodorus Siculus; and as the passage is cu∣rious, the following free translation of it may afford entertainment to the English reader—"Those who prepare to bury a relation, give notice of the day intended for the ceremony to the judges, and to all the friends of the deceased; informing them, that the body will pass over the lake of that district to which the dead be∣longed:
<PB N="89" REF="87"/>
when, on the judges being assembled, to the number of more than forty, and ranging themselves in a semicircle on the farther side of the lake, the vessel is set afloat, which those who superintend the funeral have prepared for this purpose. This vessel is managed by a pilot, called in the Egyptian language Charon; and hence they say, that Orpheus, travelling in old times into Egypt, and seeing this ceremony, formed his fable of the infernal regions, partly from what he saw, and partly from invention. The vessel being launched on the lake, before the coffin which contains the body is put on board, the law permits all, who are so inclined, to produce an accusation against it.—If any one steps forth, and proves that the deceased has led an evil life, the judges pronounce sentence, and the body is precluded from burial; but if the accuser is con∣victed of injustice in his charge, he falls himself under a consi∣derable penalty. When no accuser appears, or when the accuser is proved to be an unfair one, the relations, who are assembled, change their expressions of sorrow into encomiums on the dead: yet they do not, like the Greeks, speak in honour of his family, because they consider all Egyptians as equally well-born; but they set forth the education and manners of his youth, his piety and justice in maturer life, his moderation and every virtue by which he was distinguished; and they supplicate the infernal Deities to receive him as an associate among the blest. The multitude join their acclamations of applause in this celebration of the dead, whom they consider as going to pass an eternity among the just below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Siculi Lib. i. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.</NOTE>."— Such is the description which Diodorus gives of this funereal judicature, to which even the kings of Egypt were subject. The same author asserts, that many sovereigns had been thus judicially deprived of the honours of burial by the indignation of their peo∣ple: and that the terrors of such a fate had a most salutary influence on the virtue of their kings.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="88"/>The Abbe Tertasson has drawn a sublime picture of this sepul∣chral process, and indeed of many Egyptian Mysteries, in his very learned and ingenious romance, The Life of Sethos.</P>

The oldest compositions among the Arabs are in Rythm or rude Verse; and are often cited as proofs of the truth of their subsequent History. The accounts we have of the Peruvian story confirm the same fact; for Garcilasso tells us, that he compiled a part of his Commentaries from the antient songs of the country—Nay all the American tribes, who have any compositions, are found to establish the same truth—Northern Europe contributes its share of testimony: for there too we find the Scythian or Runie songs (many of them historical) to be the oldest compositions among these barbarous nations."</P>

<P><HI>But in the center of those vast abodes,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whose mighty mass the land of Egypt loads.</HI>] This account of the Pyramids I have adopted from the very learned Mr. Bryant, part of whose ingenious observation upon them I shall here present to the reader.</P>
<P>One great purpose in all eminent and expensive-structures is to please the stranger and traveller, and to win their admiration. This
<PB N="91" REF="89"/>
is effected sometimes by a mixture of magnificence and beauty: at other times solely by immensity and grandeur. The latter seems to have been the object in the erecting of those celebrated buildings in Egypt: and they certainly have answered the design. For not only the vastness of their structure; and the area which they occupy, but the ages they have endured, and the very uncertainty of their history, which runs so far back into the depths of antiquity, produce altogether a wonderful veneration; to which buildings more exquisite and embellished are seldom entitled. Many have supposed, that they were designed for places of sepulture: and it has been affirmed by Herodotus, and other ancient writers. But they spoke by guess: and I have shewn by many instances, how usual it was for the Grecians to mistake temples for tombs. If the chief Pyramid, were designed for a place of burial, what occasion was there for a well, and for passages of communication which led to other buildings? Near the Pyramids are apartments of a wonder∣ful fabric, which extend in length one thousand four hundred feet, and about thirty in depth. They have been cut out of the hard rock, and brought to a perpendicular by the artist's chizel; and through dint of labour fashioned as they now appear. They were undoubt∣edly designed for the reception of priests; and consequently were not appendages to a tomb; but to a temple of the Deity . . . . . . The priests of Egypt delighted in obscurity; and they probably came by the subterraneous passages of the building to the dark chambers within; where they performed their lustrations, and other nocturnal rites. Many of the ancient temples in this country were caverns in the rocks, enlarged by art, and cut out into numberless dreary apartments: for no nation upon earth was so addicted to gloom and melancholy as the Egyptians.</P>

<P><HI>The dome expands!—Behold th' Historic Sire!</HI>] Herodotus, to whom Cicero has given the honourable appellation of The Father of History, was born in Halicarnassus, a city of Caria, four years before the invasion of Xerxes, in the year 484 before Christ. The time and place of his death are uncertain; but his countryman Dionysius informs us, that he lived to the beginning of the Pelo∣ponnesian war; and Marcellinus, the Greek author who wrote a life of Thucydides, affirms there was a monument erected to these two great Historians in a burial-place belonging to the family of Miltiades.</P>
<P>There is hardly any author, antient of modern, who has been more warmly commended, or more vehemently censured, than this eminent Historian. But even the severe Dionysius declares, he is one of those enchanting writers, whom you peruse to the last syl∣lable with pleasure, and still wish for more.—Plutarch himself, who has made the most violent attack on his veracity, allows him all
<PB N="93" REF="91"/>
the merit of beautiful composition. From the heavy charges brought against him by the antients, the famous Henry Stephens, and his learned friend Camerarius, have defended their favourite His∣torian with great spirit. But Herodotus has found a more formi∣dable antagonist in a learned and animated writer of our own times, to whom the public have been lately indebted for his having opened to them new mines of Oriental learning.—If the ingenious Mr. Richardson could effectually support his Persian system, the great Father of the Grecian story must sink into a fabulist as low in point of veracity as Geoffrey of Monmouth. It must be owned, that several eminent Writers of our country have treated him as such. Another Orientalist, who, in his elegant Preface to the Life of Nader Shaw, has drawn a spirited and judicious sketch of many ca∣pital Historians, declares, in passing judgment on Herodotus, that "his accounts, of the Persian affairs are at least doubtful, if not fabulous."—Hume, I think, goes still farther, and says, in one of his essays—"The first page of Thucydides is, in my opinion, the commencement of real History." For my own part, I confess my∣self more credulous: the relation, which Herodotus has given of the repulse of Xerxes from Greece, is so delightful to the mind, and so animating to public virtue, that I should be sorry to num∣ber it among the Grecian fables.</P>

<P><HI>But mark the Youth, in dumb delight immers'd.</HI>] Thucydides, the son of Olorus, was born at Athens in the year 471 before Christ, and is said, at the age of 15, to have heard Herodotus recite his History at the Olympic games.—The generous youth was charmed even to tears, and the Historian congratulated Olorus on these marks of genius, which he discovered in his son. —Being invested with a military command, he was banished from Athens at the age of 48, by the injustice of faction, because he had unfortunately failed in the defence of Amphipolis.—He retired into Thrace, and is reported to have married a Thracian lady pos∣sessed of valuable mines in that country.—At the end of 20 years his sentence of banishment was revoked. Some authors affirm that he returned to Athens, and was treacherously killed in that city. But others assert that he died in Thrace, at the advanced age of 80, leaving his History unfinished.</P>

This amiable Philosopher and Historian was born at Athens, and became early a discipline of Socrates, who is said by Strabo to have saved his life in battle. About the 50th year of his age, according to the conjecture of his admirable translator Mr. Spelman, he engaged in the expedition of Cyrus, and accomplished his immortal retreat in the space of 15 months.—The jealousy of the Athenians ba∣nished him from his native city, for engaging in the service of Sparta and Cyrus.—On his return therefore he retired to Scillus, a town of Elis, where he built a temple to Diana, which he men∣tions in his Epistles, and devoted his leisure to philosophy and rural sports.—But commotions arising in that country, he removed to Corinth, where he is supposed to have written his Grecian History, and to have died at the age of ninety, in the year 360 before Christ. By his wife Philesia he had two sons, Diodorus and Gryllus. The latter rendered himself immortal by killing Epa∣minondas in the famous battle of Mantinea, but perished in that exploit, which his father lived to record.</P>

<P><HI>Sententious Sallust leads her lofty train.</HI>] This celebrated Histo∣rian, who from the irregularity of his life, and the beauty of his writings, has been called, not unhappily, the Bolingbroke of Rome, was born at Amiternum, a town of the Sabines.— For the profligacy of his early life he was expelled the se∣nate, but restored by the interest of Julius Caesar, who gave him the command of Numidia, which province he is said to have plun∣dered by the most infamous extortion, purchasing with part of this treasure those rich and extensive possessions on the Quirinal Hill, so celebrated by the name of the Horti Sallustiani.—He died in the 70th year of his age, four years before the battle of Actium, and 35 before the Christian aera. His enmity to Cicero is well known, and perhaps it had some influence on the peculiarity of his diction—personal animosity might make him endeavour to form a style as remote as possible from the redundant language of the im∣mortal Orator, whose turbulent wife, Terentia, he is said to have married after her divorce. This extraordinary woman is reported to have lived to the age of 103, to have married Messala, her third husband, and Vibius Rufus her fourth.—The latter boasted, with the joy of an Antiquarian, that he possessed two of the greatest cu∣riosities in the world, namely Terentia, who had been Cicero's wife, and the chair in which Caesar was killed.—St. JEROM; and DIO CASSIUS, quoted by Middleton in his life of Cicero.—But to re∣turn

This singular anecdote is also related in Bayle, under the article Panormita.—Learning per∣haps never sustained a greater loss, in any single author, than by the destruction of the latter and more interesting part of Livy.— Several eminent moderns have indulged the pleasing expectation that the entire work of this noble Historian might yet be recovered.— It has been said to exist in an Arabic version: and even a compleat copy of the original is supposed to have been extant as late as the year 1631, and to have perished at that time in the plunder of Mag∣deburgh.—That munificent patron of learning, Leo the Xth, ex∣erted the most generous zeal to rescue from oblivion the valuable treasure, which one of his most bigotted predecessors, Gregory the Great, had expelled from every Christian library.—Bayle has pre∣served, under the article Leo, two curious original letters of that Pontiff, concerning his hopes of recovering Livy; which afford most honourable proofs of his liberality in the cause of letters.</P>

<P><HI>Sarcastic Tacitus, abrupt and dark.</HI>] Tacitus was born, according to the conjecture of Lipsius, in the close of the reign of Claudius: passing through various public honours, he rose at length to the consular dignity, under Nerva, in the year of Christ 97. The date of his death is unknown, but he is said to have lived happily to an advanced age with his wife, the amiable daughter of the vir∣tuous Agricola, whose life he has so beautifully written. By this lady he is supposed to have left children; and the emperor Tacitus is conjectured to have been a remote descendant from the Historian, to whose works and memory he paid the highest regard.—It is re∣ported by Sidonius Apollinaris, that Tacitus recommended the province of writing History to Pliny the Younger, and that he did not himself engage in that employment, till his friend had declined it. This is not mentioned, indeed, in any of the beautiful letters still remaining from Pliny to Tacitus; but it is an instance of delicacy not unparallel'd among the Antients, as will appear from the following remark by one of the most elegant and liberal of mo∣dern critics.—"The Roman Poet, who was not more eminent by his genius than amiable in his moral character, affords perhaps the most remarkable instance that any where occurs, of the con∣cessions which a mind strongly impregnated with sentiments of genuine amity, is capable of making. Virgil's superior talents rendered him qualified to excel in all the nobler species of poetical composition: nevertheless, from the most uncommon delicacy of friendship, he sacrificed to his intimacy with Horace, the unrivall'd reputation he might have acquired by indulging his lyric vein; as from the same refined motive he forbore to exercise his dramatic

<P>As to Tacitus, it is clear, I think, from the Letters of Pliny, as well as from his own most pleasing Life of Agricola, that he pos∣sessed all the refined and affectionate feelings of the heart in a very high degree, though the general cast of his historical works might lead us to imagine, that austerity was his chief characteristic.—It would be easy to fill a volume in transcribing the great encomiums, and the violent censures, which have been lavished by modern writers of almost every country on this profound Historian.—The last critic of eminence, who has written against him, in Britain, is, I believe, the learned Author of The Origin and Progress of Lan∣guage; who, in his 3d volume of that work, has made many cu∣rious remarks on the composition of the antient Historians, and is particularly severe on the diction of Tacitus. He represents him as the defective model, from which modern writers have copied, what he is pleased to call, <HI>"the short and priggish cut of style so much in use now."</HI></P>

According to the learned Fabri∣cius,
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>
he was born under Claudius, 50 years after the Christian aera, raised to the consular dignity under Trajan, whose preceptor he is said to have been, and made Procurator of Greece in his old age by the Emperor Adrian—in the 5th year of whose reign he is sup∣posed to have died, at the age of 70. He was married to a most amiable woman of his own native town Chaeronea, whose name was Timoxena, and to whose sense and virtue he has borne the most affectionate testimony in his moral works; of which it may be re∣gretted that we have no elegant translation. Indeed even the Lives of Plutarch, the most popular of all the antient historical compo∣sitions, were chiefly known to the English reader by a motley and miserable version, till a new one, executed with fidelity and spirit, was presented to the public by the Langhornes in 1770.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE OF THE PRINCESS ANNA COMNENA, FROM THE GREEK, Prefixed to her ALEXIAD, or History of her Father the Emperor ALEXIUS.</HEAD>
<P>TIME, which flows irresistibly, ever encroaching, and stealing something from human life, seems to bear away all that is mortal into a gulph darkness; sometimes destroying such things as
<PB N="104" REF="102"/>
deserve not utterly to be forgotten, and sometimes, such as are most noble, and most worthy of remembrance. Now (to use the words of the tragic poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sophocles.</NOTE>)
<Q><L>Discovering things invisible; and now</L>
<L>Sweeping each present object from our sight.</L></Q>
But History forms the strongest barrier against this tide of Time: it withstands, in some measure, the violence of the torrent, and, by collecting and cementing such things as appear worthy of preservation, while they are hurried along the stream, it allows them not to sink into the abyss of oblivion.</P>
<P>On this consideration, I Anna, the daughter of the emperor Alexius, and his consort Irene, born and educated in imperial splendor—not utterly void of literature, and solicitous to distin∣guish myself by that Grecian characteristic—as I have already ap∣plied myself to Rhetoric, and having thoroughly studied the Principles of Aristotle and the Dialogues of Plato, have endea∣voured to adorn my mind with the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Astrology, Geometry, Arithmetic, and Music.</NOTE> four usual branches of educa∣tion (for I think it incumbent on me, even at the risque of ap∣pearing vain, to declare what qualifications for the present task I have received from nature, or gained by application; what Provi∣dence has bestowed upon me, or time and opportunity supplied.) On these accounts, I am desirous of commemorating, in my pre∣sent work, the actions of my father, as they deserve not to be bu∣ried in silence, or to be plunged, as it were, by the tide of Time, into the ocean of Oblivion: both those actions which he per∣formed after he obtained the diadem, and those before that period, while he was himself a subject of other Princes. I engage in this narration, not so much to display any little talent for composition,
<PB N="105" REF="103"/>
as to prevent transactions of such importance from perishing unre∣corded: since even the brightest of human atchievements, if not consigned to memory under the guard of writing, are extinguished, as it were, by the Darkness of Silence.</P>
<P>My father was a man, who knew both how to govern, and to pay to governors a becoming obedience: but in chusing his actions for my subject, I am apprehensive, in the very outset of my work, lest I may be censured as the Panegyrist of my own family for writing of my father; that if I speak of him with admiration, my whole History will be considered as a false an flattering enco∣mium; and if any circumstance, I may have occasion to mention, leads me, as it were by force, to disapprove some part even of his conduct. I am apprehensive, on the other hand, not from the cha∣racter of my father, but from the very nature of things, that some malignant censurers may compare me to Cham, the son of Noah; since there are many, whom envy and malevolence will not suffer to form a fair judgment, and who, to speak in the words of Homer,
<Q>Are keen to censure, where no blame is due.</Q>
For whoever engages in the province of History, is bound to for∣get all sentiments both of favour and aversion; and often to adorn his enemies with the highest commendations, when their actions are entitled to such reward; and often to censure his most intimate friends, when the failings of their life and manners require it.— These are duties equally incumbent on the Historian, which he cannot decline. As to myself, with regard to those who may be affected either by my censure or my praise, I would wish to assure them, that I speak both of them, and their conduct, according to the evidence of their actions themselves, or the report of those who beheld them; for either the fathers, or the grandfathers, of many persons now living were ocular witnesses of what I shall
<PB N="106" REF="104"/>
record. I have been chiefly led to engage in this History of my father by the following circumstance:—It was my fortune to marry Caesar Nicephorus, of the Bryennian family, a man far superior to all his cotemporaries, not only in personal beauty, but in sublimity of understanding, and all the charms of eloquence! for he was equally the admiration of those who saw, and those who heard him. But that my discourse may not wander from its present pur∣pose, let me proceed in my narration!—He was then, among all men, the most distinguished; and when he marched with the emperor John Comnenus, my brother, on his expedition against Antioch, and other places in possession of the Barbarians, still un∣able to abstain from literary pursuits, even in those scenes of labour and fatigue, he wrote various compositions worthy of remembrance and of honour. But he chiefly applied himself to the writing an account of what related to my father Alexius, emperor of the Romans, at the request of the empress; reducing into proper form the transactions of his reign, whenever the times would allow him to devote short intervals of leisure from arms and battle to works of literature, and the labour of composition. In forming this History, he deduced his accounts from an early period, being di∣rected in this point also by the instruction of our royal mistress; beginning from the emperor Diogenes, and descending to the per∣son, whom he had chosen for the Hero of his Drama—for this season first shewed my father to be a youth of expectation. Be∣fore this period he was a mere infant; and of course performed nothing worthy of being recorded: unless even the occurrences of his childhood should be thought a fit subject for History. Such then was the design and scope of Caesar's composition: but he fail'd in the hope he had entertained, of bringing his History to its conclusion: for having brought it to the times of the emperor Nicephorus Botoniates, he there broke off, having no future op∣portunity allowed him of continuing his narration: a circum∣stance,
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>
which has proved a severe loss to Literature, and robbed his readers of delight!—On this account I have undertaken to record the actions of my father, that such atchievements may not escape posterity. What degree of harmony and grace the writings of Caesar possessed, all persons know, who have been fortunate enough to see his compositions. But having executed his work to the pe∣riod I have mentioned, in the midst of hurry and fatigue, and bring∣ing it to us half finished from his expedition, he brought home, alas! at he same time, a disorder that proved mortal, contracted perhaps from the hardships of his passage, or perhaps from that harrassing scene of perpetual action, and possibly indeed from his infinite anxiety on my account; for anxiety was natural to his af∣fectionate heart, and his labours were without intermission. More∣over the change and badness of climates might prepare for him this draught of death. For notwithstanding the dreadful state of his health, he persevered in the campaign against the Syrians and Cili∣cians, till at length he was conveyed out of Syria in a most infirm state, and was brought through Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lydia, and Bithynia, home to the metropolis of the empire, and to his fa∣mily. But his vitals were now affected by his infinite fatigue.— Even in this state of weakness he was desirous of displaying the events of his expedition: but this his disorder rendered him unable to execute, and indeed we enjoined him not to attempt it, lest by the effort of such a narration he should burst open his wound.— But in the recollection of these things, my whole soul is darkened, and my eyes are covered with a flood of tears.—O what a director of the Roman counsels was then torn from us! O what an end was there to all the treasures of clear, of various, and of useful knowledge, which he had collected from observation and expe∣rience, both in regard to foreign affairs, and the internal business of the empire! —O what a form was then destroyed!—Beauty, that seemed not only entitled to dominion, but bearing even the
<PB N="108" REF="106"/>
semblance of divinity!—I indeed have been conversant with every calamity; and have found, even from the imperial cradle, an un∣propitious fortune: some perhaps might esteem that fortune not unpropitious, which seemed to smile upon my birth, in giving me sovereigns for my parents, and nursing me in the imperial purple: but for the other circumstances of my life, alas, what tempests! alas, what perturbations! The melody of Orpheus affected even ina∣nimate nature; and Timotheus, in playing the Orthic song to Alexander, made the Macedon start to arms.</P>
<P>The relation of my miseries would not, indeed, produce such effects; but it would move every auditor to tears; it would force not only beings endued with sensibility, but even inanimate nature to sympathize in my sorrow.—This remembrance of Caesar, and his unexpected death, tears open the deepest wound of my soul: Indeed, I consider all my former misfortunes, if compared to this immeasureable calamity, but as a drop of water to the Atlantic sea: or rather, my earlier afflictions were a kind of prelude to this: they first involved me, as it were, like a smoke preceding this raging fire: they were a kind of heat, that portended a conflagra∣tion, which no words can describe. O thou fire, that blazest without fuel, preying on my heart without destroying its existence; piercing through my very bones, and shrinking up my soul!— But I perceive myself hurried away from my subject: this mention of Caesar, and what I suffer in his loss, has led me into the pro∣lixity of grief: wiping therefore the tear from my eyes, and re∣straining myself from this indulgence of sorrow, I will proceed in order; yet, as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Euripides.</NOTE> tragic Poet says,
<Q>Still adding tear to tear,</Q>
as recollecting misfortune after misfortune: for the entering on the History of such a king, so eminent for his virtues, revives
<PB N="109" REF="107"/>
in my mind all the wonders he performed, which move me to fresh tears: and these I share in common with all the world; for the remembrance of him, and the recital of his reign, supplies to me a new subject of lamentation, and must remind others of the loss they have sustained.</P>
<P>But let me at length begin the History of my father, from the period most proper:—now the most proper period is that, which will give to my narration the clearest, and most historical appearance.—</P>

For the entertainment of the curious reader, I shall transcribe the two mi∣raculous passages alluded to in the poem:—Ante diem belli, castris et arietibus &amp; turmis praeparatis in pratis, scilicet quae sunt inter castrum, quod dicitur Talaburgum, &amp; urbem, juxta fluvium Caranta, infixerunt Christiani quidam hastas suas erectas in terra ante castra, crastina vero die bastas suas corticibus &amp; frondibus de∣coratas invenerunt; hi scilicet qui in bello praesenti accepturi erant martyrii palmam pro Christi fide.—Qui etiam tanto miraculo Dei gavisi, abscissis hastis suis de terra, simul coaduniti primitus in bello perierunt, &amp; multos Saracenos occiderunt, sed tandem Martyrio coronantur. Cap. X.</P>
<P>After the soliloquy of Roland, addressed to his sword, which most readers have seen quoted in Mr. Warton's excellent Obser∣vations on Spenser, the Historian proceeds thus:—Timens ne in manus Saracenorum deveniret, percussit spata lapidem marmoreum trino ictu; a summo usque deorsum lapis dividitur, &amp; gladius biceps illaesus educitur.—Deinde tuba sua coepit altisona tonitruare, si forte aliqui ex Christianis, qui per nemora Saracenorum timore latitabant, ad se venirent. Vel si illi, qui portus jam transierant, forte ad se redirent, suoque funeri adessent, spatamque suam &amp; equum acciperent, et Saracenos persequerentur.

<P><HI>Yet modest Aeginhard, with grateful care.</HI>] The celebrated Secretary and supposed Son-in-law of Charlemain; who is said to have been carried through the snow on the shoulders of the affectionate and ingenious Imma, to prevent his being tracked from her apartment by the Emperor her father: a story which the elegant pen of Addison has copied and embellished from an old German Chro∣nicle, and inserted in the 3d volume of the Spectator.—This happy lover (supposing the story to be true) seems to have possessed a heart not unworthy of so enchanting a mistress, and to have re∣turned her affection with the most faithful attachment; for there is a letter of Aeginhard's still extant, lamenting the death of his wife, which is written in the tenderest strain of connubial afflic∣tion—it does not however express that this lady was the affec∣tionate Princess, and indeed some late critics have proved, that Imma was not the daughter of Charlemain.—But to return to our Historian.—He was a native of Germany, and educated by the mu∣nificence of his imperial master, of which he has left the most grateful testimony in his Preface to the Life of that Monarch— the passage may serve to shew both the amiable mind of the Historian, and the elegance of his style, considering the age in which he wrote:—Suberat &amp; alia non irrationabilis, ut opinor causa, quae vel sola sufficere posset, ut me ad haec soribenda com∣pelleret; nutrimentum videlicet in me impensum, &amp; perpetua, postquam in aula ejus conversari coepi, cum ipso ac liberis ejus amicitia, qua me ita sibi devinxit, debitoremque tam vivo quam

Sed parum prosperè successit labor prae∣posterus, ac serò inchoatus.—Aeginhard, after the loss of his la∣mented wife, is supposed to have passed the remainder of his days in religious retirement, and to have died soon after the year 840.— His Life of Charlemain, his Annals from 741 to 829, and his Let∣ters, are all inserted in the 2d volume of Duchesne's Scriptores Fran∣corum.

<P><HI>With Merlin's spells and Uther's amorous rage.</HI>] The first of the two excellent dissertations prefixed to Mr. Warton's History of English Poetry, gives the most perfect account of this famous old Chronicler and his whimsical performance.—"About the year 1100, Gualter, Archdeacon of Oxford, a learned man, and a dili∣gent collector of Histories, travelling through France, procured in Armorica an antient Chronicle, written in the British or Armo∣rican language, entitled, <HI>Brut-y-Brenhined,</HI> or the History of the Kings of Britain.

Monk, an elegant writer of Latin, and admirably skilled in the British tongue. Geoffrey, at the request and recommendation of Gualter the Archdeacon, translated this British Chronicle into Latin, executing the Translation with a tolerable degree of purity, and great fidelity, yet not without some interpolations.—It was probably finished after the year 1138."—"The simple subject of this Chronicle, divested of its romantic embellishments, is a deduction of the Welsh Princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cadwallader, who reigned in the seventh century." To this extract from Mr. War∣ton, it may be proper to add a concise account of that romantic embellishment, to which I have particularly alluded:—Uther Pen∣dragon, at the festival of his coronation, falls in love with Igerna, the wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall; and being prevented from, pursuing his addresses by the vigilance of the husband, he applies to the magical power of Merlin for the completion of his desire.— This he obtains by being transformed into the person of Gorlois, and thus introducing himself to the deluded Igerna, as Jupiter vi∣sited Alcmena, he gives birth to the celebrated Arthur.—Mansit itaque rex ea nocte cum Igerna &amp; sese desiderata venere refecit. De∣ceperat namque illam falsa species quam assumpserat: deceperat etiam fictitiis sermonibus, quos ornate componebat . . . unde ipsa credula nihil quod poscebatur abnegavit.

History, the most liberal and judicious of all our monastic Histo∣rians. His principal work is a History of our Kings, from the arrival of the Saxons to the 20th year of Henry the First. This was followed by two books of later History, which close with the celebrated escape of the Empress Matilda from the Castle of Ox∣ford, 1142. These works are both addressed to that munificent patron of merit, Robert Earl of Gloucester, natural son of Henry the First, who was perhaps the most exalted and accomplished cha∣racter, that ever flourished in so barbarous an age. The Historian speaks of his noble friend with all the simplicity of truth, and all the warmth of virtuous admiration. He died, according to Pitts, in 1143, three years before his generous patron; and this is probable, from his not pursuing his History, which he intimates a design of resuming.—Yet there is a passage preserved in Tanner, from the Preface to his Comments on Jeremiah, which seems to prove, that he lived to a later period, since he mentions his historical works as the production of his younger days, and speaks of his age as devoted to religious composition. Besides his four books de gestis Pontificum Anglorum, he wrote many works of the same pious turn, which the curious reader may see enumerated in Tanner's Bibliotheca.</P>

<P><HI>A faithful Chronicler in plain Froissart.</HI>] John Froissart, Canon and Treasurer of the collegiate church of Chimay, in Henault, was born at Valenciennes, a city of that province, in 1337, according to the conjecture of that elaborate and ingenious antiquarian Mr. de St. Palaye; who has amply illustrated the Life and Writings of this engaging Historian, in a series of dissertations among the Memoirs of the French Academy, Vol. X. 13, 14.—St. Palaye imagines, from a passage in the MS Poems of Froissart, that his father was a painter of Armories:—and it is certain the Historian discovers a
<PB N="117" REF="117"/>
passion for all the pomp and all the minutiae of heraldry of that martial age; and Froissart, more the priest of gallantry than of re∣ligion, devoted himself entirely to the celebration of love and war. —At the age of 20, he began to write History, at the request <HI>de son eber Seigneur &amp; Maitre Messire</HI> Robert de Namur, Chevalier Seig∣neur de Beaufort.—The anguish of unsuccessful love drove him early into England, and his first voyage seems a kind of emblem of his future life; for he sailed hither in a storm, yet continued writ∣ing a rondeau in spite of the tempest, till he found himself on that coast, ou l'on aime mieux la guerre, que la paix, &amp; ou les estrangers sont très-bien venus, as he said of our country <HI>in his verses,</HI> and happily experienced in his kind reception at court, where Phi∣lippa of Henault, the Queen of Edward the Third, and a Patroness of learning, distinguished the young Historian, her countryman, by the kindest protection; and, finding that love had rendered him unhappy, supplied him with money and with horses, that he might present himself with every advantage before the object of his pas∣sion.—Love soon escorted him to his mistress—but his addresses were again unsuccessful; and, taking a second voyage to England, he became Secretary to his royal patroness Philippa, in 1361, after having presented to her some portion of his History.—He con∣tinued five years in her service, entertaining her majesty <HI>de beaux dictiez &amp; traictez amoureux:</HI> in this period he paid a visit to Scot∣land, and was entertained 15 days by William Earl Douglas.—In 1366, when Edward the Black Prince was preparing for the war in Spain, Froissart was with him in Gascony, and hoped to attend him during the whole course of that important expedition:—but the Prince sent him back to the Queen his mother.—He continued not long in England, as he visited many of the Italian courts in the following year, and during his travels sustained the irreparable loss of that patroness, to whose bounty he had been so much in∣debted.—Philippa died 1369, and Froissart is reported to have
<PB N="118" REF="118"/>
written the life of his amiable protectress; but of this perform∣ance, the researches of St. Palaye could discover no trace.</P>
<P>After this event, he retired to his own country, and obtained the benefice of Lestines, in the diocese of Cambray.—But the cure of souls was an office little suited to the gay and gallant Froissart.— His genius led him still to travel from castle to castle, and from court to court, to use the words of Mr. Warton, who has made occasional mention of our author, in his elegant History of English Poetry.—Froissart now entered into the service of the Duke of Bra∣bant; and, as that Prince was himself a poet, Froissart collected all the compositions of his master, and adding some of his own, formed a kind of romance, which he calls
<Q><L>Un Livre de Meliador</L>
<L>Le Chevalier au soleil d'or,</L></Q>
and of which, in one of his later poems, he gives the following ac∣count:
<Q><L>Dedans ce Romant sont encloses</L>
<L>Toutes les chançons que jadis,</L>
<L>Dont l'ame soit en paradis,</L>
<L>Que fit le bon Duc de Braibant,</L>

<L>Et le livre me fit ja faire,</L>
<L>Par très grant amoureus à faire,</L>
<L>Coment qu'il ne le veist oncques.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Duke died in 1384, before this work was completed; and Froissart soon found a new patron in Guy earl of Blois, on the marriage of whose Son he wrote a Pastoral, entitled Le Temple d'Honneur.—The earl having requested him to resume his History,
<PB N="119" REF="119"/>
he travelled for that purpose to the celebrated court of Gaston earl of Foix, whose high reputation for every knightly virtue attracted to his residence at Orlaix, those martial adventurers, from whose mouth it was the delight of Froissart to collect the materials of his History.—The courteous Gaston gave him the most flattering recep∣tion: he said to him with a smile (&amp; en bon François) "qu'il le connoissoit bien, quoyqu'il ne l'eust jamais veu, mais qu'il avoit bien oui parler de luy, &amp; le retint de son hostel."—It became a fa∣vourite amusement of the Earl, to hear Froissart read his Romance of Meliador after supper.—He attended in the castle every night at 12, when the Earl sate down to table, listened to him with ex∣treme attention, and never dismissed him, till he had made him vuider tout ce qui estoit resté du vin de sa bouche.—Froissart gained much information here, not only from his patron, who was himself very communicative, but from various Knights of Arragon and England, in the retinue of the Duke of Lancaster, who then resided at Bordeaux.—After a long residence in this brilliant court, and after receiving a present from the liberal Gaston, which he mentions in the following verses:
<Q><L>Je pris congé &amp; li bons Contes</L>
<L>Me fit par sa chambre des comptes</L>
<L>Delivrer quatrevins florins</L>
<L>D'Arragon, tous pesans &amp; fins</L>
<L>Et mon livre, qu'il m'ot laissé.</L></Q>
Froissart departed in the train of the Countess of Boulogne, related to the earl of Foix, and just leaving him, to join her new husband the Duke of Berry.—In this expedition our Historian was robbed near Avignon, and laments the unlucky adventure in a very long poem, from which Mr. de St. Palaye has drawn many particulars of his life. The ground-work of this poem (which is not in the list of our Author's poetical pieces, that Mr. Warton has given us from Pasquier) seems to have a strong vein of humour.—It is a
<PB N="120" REF="120"/>
dialogue between the Poet and the single Florin that he has left out of the many which he had either spent, or been obliged to sur∣render to the robbers.—He represents himself as a man of the most expensive turn: in 25 years he had squandered two thousand franks, besides his ecclesiastical revenues. The composition of his works had cost him 700; but he regretted not this sum, as he expected to be amply repaid for it by the praise of posterity.</P>
<P>After having attended all the festivals on the marriage of the Duke of Berry, having traversed many parts of France, and paid a visit to Zeland, he returned to his own country in 1390, to continue his History from the various materials he had collected.—But not satisfied with the relations he had heard of the war in Spain, he went to Middlebourgh in Zeland, in pursuit of a Portugueze Knight, Jean Ferrand Portelet, vaillant homme &amp; sage, &amp; du Conseil du Roy de Portugal. From this accomplished soldier Froissart expected the most perfect information, as an ocular witness of those scenes, which he now wished to record.—The courteous Portelet received our indefatigable Historian with all the kindness which his en∣thusiasm deserved, and in six days, which they passed together, gave him all the intelligence he desired.—Froissart now returned home, and finished the third book of his History.—Many years had past since he had bid adieu to England: taking advantage of the truce then established between France and that country, he paid it ano∣ther visit in 1395, with letters of recommendation to the King and his uncles.—From Dover he proceeded to Canterbury, to pay his devoirs at the shrine of Thomas of Becket, and to the memory of the Black Prince.—Here he happened to find the son of that hero, the young King Richard, whom devotion had also brought to make his offerings to the fashionable Saint, and return thanks to Heaven for his successes in Ireland.—Froissart speaks of this adventure, and his own feelings on the great change of scene that had taken place since his last visit to England, in the following natural and lively terms:—Le Roy . . . vint . . a trez grant arroy, et bien accom∣paigne
<PB N="121" REF="121"/>
de seignneurs, de dames et demoiselles, et me mis entre eulx, &amp; entre elles, et tout me sembla nouvel, ne je ny congnoissoye personne; car le tems estoit bien change en Angleterre depuis le tems de vingt &amp; huyt ans: et en la compagnie du roy n'avoit nuls de ses oncles . . . . si fus du premier ainsi que tout esbahy . . . Tho' Froissart was thus embarrassed in not finding one of his old friends in the retinue of the King, he soon gained a new Patron in Thomas Percy, Master of the Household, who offered to present him and his letters to Richard; but this offer happening on the eve of the King's departure, it proves too late for the ceremony— Le Roy estoit retrait pour aller dormir.—And on the morrow, when the impatient Historian attended early at the Archbishop's palace, where the king slept, his friend Percy advised him to wait a more convenient season for being introduced to Richard.—Froissart ac∣quiesced in this advice, and was consoled for his disappointment by falling into company with an English Knight, who had attended the King in Ireland, and was very willing to gratify the curiosity of the Historian by a relation of his adventure.—This was Wil∣liam de Lisle, who entertained him, as they rode along together, with the marvels of St. Patrick's Cave, in which he assured him he had passed a night, and seen wonderful visions.—Though our ho∣nest Chronicler is commonly accused of a passion for the marvel∣lous, with an excess of credulity, he says very sensibly on this oc∣casion, de cette matiere je ne luy parlay plus avant, et m'en cessay, car voulentiers je luy eusse demande du voyage d'Irlande, et luy eu voulaye parler, et mettre en voye.—It appears plainly from this passage, that our Historian was more anxious to gain information concerning the scenes of real action, than to listen to the extrava∣gant fictions of a popular legend.—But here he was again disap∣pointed.—New companions joined them on the road, and their historical conference was thus interrupted.—These mortifications were soon repaid by the kind reception he met with from the Duke of York, who said to him, when he received the recom∣mendatory
<PB N="122" REF="122"/>
letter from the Earl of Henault, "Maistre Jehan tenez vous toujour deles nous, &amp; nos gens, nous vous ferons tout amour &amp; courtoisie, nous y sommes tenus pour l'amour du tems passé &amp; de notre dame de mere à qui vous futes; nous en avons bien la souvenance."—With these flattering marks of remembrance and favour the Duke presented him to the King, lequel me receut joyeusement et doulcement (continues Froissart) . . et ne dist que je fusse le bien venus et si j'avoye este de l'hostel du Roy son Ayeul &amp; de Madame son Ayeule encores estoys je de l'hostel d'Angleterre. —Some time however elapsed, before he had an opportunity of presenting his romance of Meliador, which he had prepared for the King.—The Duke of York and his other friends at length ob∣tained for him this honour: He gives the following curious and particular account of the ceremony: et voulut veoir le Roy mon livre, que je luy avoye apporte. Si le vit en sa chambre: car tout pourveu je l'avoye, et luy mis sur son lict. Er lors il l'ouvrit et regarda dedans, et luy pleut tres grandement. Et plaire bien luy devoit: car il estoit enlumine, escrit et Historie, &amp; couvert de vermeil veloux a dix cloux d'argent dorez d'or et roses d'or ou meillieu a deux gros fermaulx dorez et richement ouvrez ou meil∣lieu rosiers d'or. Adonc me demanda le Roy de quoy il traictoit: et je luy dis d'amours. De ceste responce fut tout resjouy, et re∣garda dedans le livre en plusieurs lieux, et y lysit, car moult bien parloit et lysoit Françoys, et puis le fist prendre par ung sien Chevalier, qui se nomme Messire Richard Credon, et porter en sa chambre de retrait dont il me fist bonne chere.</P>
<P>After passing three month in this court, Froissart took his leave of the munificent but ill-fated Richard. In the last chapter of his History, where he mentions the unfortunate end of this Monarch, he speaks with an honest and affecting gratitude of the liberal pre∣sent he received from him on his departure from England.—It was a goblet of silver gilt, weighing two marks, and filled with a hun∣dred nobles.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="123"/>On leaving England, he retired to his own country, and is sup∣posed to have ended his days at his benefice of Chimay, but the year of his death is uncertain.—There is an antient tradition in the country, says Mr. de Saint Palaye, that he was buried in the chapel of St. Anne, belonging to his own church.—That ingeni∣ous antiquarian produces an extract from its archives, in which the death of Froissart is recorded, but without naming the year, in the most honourable terms.—His obit bears the date of October, and is followed by 20 Latin verses, from which I select such as appear to me the most worth transcribing.</P>

<P>As I have never met with any satisfactory account of Froissart's life in our language, I have been tempted to swell this Note to an inordinate length; yet it seems to me still necessary to add a few lines more concerning the character both of the Historian and the Poet.—A long series of French Critics, to whom even the judicious Bayle has been tempted to give credit, have severely censured Froissart, as the venal partizan of the English, and they have accused his last Editor, Sauvage, of mutilating his author, because they could find in his edition on proofs of their charge.—The amiable St. Palaye has defended le bon Froissart, as he is called by honest Montaigne,
<PB N="124" REF="124"/>
from this unjust accusation, and done full justice at the same time to the injured reputation of his exact and laborious editor.</P>
<P>It may serve as a kind of memento mori to poetical vanity to reflect, that Froissart is hardly known as a Poet, though his fer∣tile pen produced 30,000 verses, which were once the delight of Princes, and the favourite study of the gallant and the fair.—How far he deserved the oblivion, into which his poetical compositions have fallen, the reader may conceive from the following judgment of his French Critic; with whose ingenious reflection on the im∣perfections attending the early state both of Poetry and Painting, I shall terminate this Note.</P>
<P>On peut dire en général au sujet des Poesies de Froissart, que l'invention pour les sujets lui manquoit antant que l'imagination pour les ornemens; du reste le style qu'il employe, moins abon∣dant que diffus, offre souvent la répétition ennuyeuse des mêmes tours, &amp; des mêmes phrases, pour rendre des idées assez commu∣nes: cependant la simplicité et la liberté de sa versification ne sont pas toûjours dépourvûes de graces, on y rencontre de tems en tems quelques images &amp; plusieurs vers de suite dont l'expression est assez heureuse.</P>
<P>Tel étoit alors l'état de notre Poesie Françoise, et le sort de la Peinture étoit à peu près le meme. Ces deux arts que l'on a taujours comparez ensemble paroissent avoir eu une marche presqu' uniforme dans leur progrès. Les Peintres au sortir de la plus grossiére barbarie, saisissant d'abord en détail tous les petits objets que la nature leur presentoit, s'attachérent aux insectes, aux fleurs, aux oiseaux, les perérent des couleurs les plus vives, les dessiné∣rent avec une exactitude que nous admirons encore dans les vignettes &amp; dans les miniatures des manuscrits; lorsqu'ils vinrent à repré∣senter des figures humaines, ils s'étudiérent bien plus à terminer les contours &amp; à exprimer jusqu' aux cheveux les plus fins, qu'à donner de l'ame aux visages &amp; du mouvement aux corps; et ces figures dont la nature la plus commune fournissoit toujours les
<PB N="125" REF="125"/>
modelles, étoient jettées ensemble au hazard, sans choix, sans or∣donnance, sans aucun goût de composition.</P>
<P>Les Poetes aussi stériles que les Peintres, bornoient toute leur in∣dustrie à scavoir amener des descriptions proportionnées à leur ta∣lens, et ils ne les quittoient qu'après les avoir épuisées; ils ne sça∣vent guéres parler que d'un beau printems, de la verdure des cam∣pagnes, de l'émail des prairies, du ramage de mille especes d'oi∣seaux, de la clarté et de la vivacité d'une belle fontaine ou d'un ruisseau qui murmure; quelquefois cependant ils rendent avec naïveté les amusemens enfantins des amans, leurs ris, leurs jeux, les palpitations ou la joie d'un coeur amoreux; ils n'imaginent rien au delà, incapable d'ailleurs de donner de la suite et de la liaison à leurs idées.</P>

<P><HI>Thy Favour, like the Sun's prolific ray,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brought the keen Scribe of Florence into Day.</HI>] Nicholas Machiavel, the celebrated Florentine, was first patronized by Leo, who caused one of his comedies to be acted with great magnificence at Rome, and engaged him to write a private Treatise de Reformatione Rei∣publicae Florentinae. His famous political Essay, entitled, "The Prince," was published in 1515, and dedicated to the Nephew of that Pontiff. The various judgments that have been passed on this singular performance are a striking proof of the incertitude of hu∣man opinion.—In England it has received applause from the great names of Bacon and Clarendon, who suppose it intended to pro∣mote the interest of liberty and virtue. In Italy, after many years of approbation, it was publicly condemned by Clement the VIIIth, at the instigation of a Jesuit, who had not read the book. In France it has even been supposed instrumental to the horrid
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
massacre of St. Bartholomew, as the favourite study of Catherine of Medicis and her Sons, and as teaching the bloody lessons of ex∣tirpation, which they so fatally put in practice. Yet one of his French Translators has gone so far as to say, that "Machiavel, who passes among all the world for a teacher of Tyranny, detested it more than any man of the age, in which he lived." It must however be owned, that there is a great mixture of good and evil in his political precepts. For the latter many plausible apologies have been made; and it should be remembered to his honour, that his great aim was to promote the welfare of his country, in exciting the House of Medicis to deliver Italy from the invasion of fo∣reigners.</P>
<P>He is said to have been made Historiographer of Florence, as a reward for having suffered the torture on suspicion of conspiring against the government of that city, having supported the severe trial with unfailing resolution. His History of that republic he wrote at the request of Clement the VIIth, as we are informed in his Dedication of it to that Pontiff. The style of this work is much celebrated, and the first Book may be regarded as a model of Historical abridgment.—He died, according to Paul Jovius, in 153O.</P>

In 1512 he was sent Embassador to Ferdinand King of Arragon; and soon after his return deputed by the Republic to meet Leo the Xth at Cortona, and attend him on his public entry into Flo∣rence.—That discerning Pontiff immediately became his Patron, and raised him to the government of Modena and Reggio. He

succeeded to that of Parma, which he defended with great spirit against the French, on the death of Leo.—He rose to the highest honours under Clement the VIIth, having the command of all the ecclesiastical forces, and being Governor of Romagna, and lastly of Bologna, in which city he is said to have received the most flatter∣ing compliments from the Emperor Charles V.—Having gained much reputation, both civil and military, in various scenes of ac∣tive life, he passed his latter days in retirement, at his villa near Florence, where he died soon after completing his History, in the 59th year of his age, 1540. Notwithstanding the high reputation of Guicciardin, his History has been violently attacked, both as to matter and style.—The honest Montaigne inveighs with great warmth against the malignant turn of its author; and his own coun∣tryman Boccalini, in whose whimsical but lively work there are many excellent remarks on History and Historians, supposes a La∣cedaemonian thrown into agonies by a single page of Guicciardin, whom he is condemned to read, for having himself been guilty of using three words instead of two. The poor Spartan cries for mercy, and declares that any tortures are preferable to the prolixity of such a Writer.—This celebrated Historian was also Poet. The three following verses are the beginning of an Epistle, which he entitled Supplicazione d'Italia al Christianissimo Rè Francesco I.</P>

<P><HI>With equal wreaths let Davila be crown'd.</HI>] Henry Catherine Davila was the youngest son of Antonio Davila, Grand Constable of Cy∣prus,
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
who had been obliged to retire into Spain on the taking of that island by the Turks in 1570. From Spain Antonio repaired to the court of France, and settled his son Lewis and two daughters under the patronage of Catherine of Medicis, whose name he after∣wards gave to the young Historian, born 1576, at an antient castle in the territories of Padua, though generally called a native of Cyprus. The little Davila was brought early into France;— at the age of 18 he signalized himself in the military scenes of that country. His last exploit there was at the siege of Amiens, where he fought under Henry IV, and received a wound in the knee, as he relates himself in his History.—After peace was established in France, he withdrew into Italy, and served the Republic of Venice with great reputation till a most unfortunate adventure put an end to his life in 1631.—Passing through Verona with his wife and family, on his way to Crema, which he was appointed to defend, and demanding, according to the usual custom of persons in his sta∣tion, a supply of horses and carriages for his retinue, a brutal Ve∣ronese, called il Turco, entered the room where he and his family were at supper, and being mildly reprimanded for his intrusion by Davila, discharged a pistol at the Historian, and shot him dead on the instant.—His accomplices also killed the Chaplain of Davila, and wounded many of his attendants. But his eldest son Antonio, a noble youth of eighteen, revenged the death of his father by killing his murderer on the spot. All the confederates were se∣cured the next morning, and publicly executed at Verona.—Me∣moire Istoriche, prefixed to the London edition of Davila, 4to, 1755.—It is very remarkable, that Davila passes no censure on the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.—His character of the Queen Mother has that partiality, which it was natural for him to shew to the Patroness of his family; but his general veracity is con∣firmed by the great authority of the first Duke of Epernon, who, (to use the words of Lord Bolingbroke) "had been an actor, and a principal actor too, in many of the scenes that Davila recites."

Girard, Secretary to this Duke, and no contemptible Biographer, relates, that this History came down to the place where the old man resided, in Gascony, a little before his death; that he read it to him; that the Duke confirmed that truth of the narrations in it: and seemed only surprised by what means the author could be so well informed of the most secret councils and measures of those times."—Letters on History.</P>

<P><HI>Sarpi, blest name! from every foible clear.</HI>] Father Paul, the most amiable and exalted character that was ever formed in monastic retirement, was the son of Francesco Sarpi, a merchant of Venice, and born in that city, 1552. He took the religious habit in the monastery of the Servites, 1565. After receiving priest's orders in 1574, he passed four years in Mantua, being appointed to read Lectures on Divinity and Canon Law, by the Bishop of that diocese; and in this early part of his life, he is conjectured to have con∣ceived the first idea of writing his celebrated History, as he formed an intimate friendship, during his residence in Mantua, with Ca∣millo d'Oliva, who had been Secretary to Cardinal Gonzaga at the Council of Trent, and excited the learned Venetian to the arduous task, which he so happily accomplished in a future pe∣riod. He was recalled from Mantua, to read Lectures on Philoso∣phy in his own convent at Venice, which he did with great repu∣tation, during the years 1575, 1576, and 1577.—He went to Rome as Procurator General in 1585. Passing from thence to Naples, he there formed an acquaintance with the famous Baptista Porta, who has left this honourable testimony of his universal knowledge: —Eo doctiorem, subtiliorem, quotquot adhuc videre contigerit, neminem cognovimus; natum ad Encyclopediam, &amp;c. Nor is this an exaggerated compliment, as there is hardly any science which escaped his active mind. His discoveries in Optics and Anatomy would be alone sufficient to immortalize his name, had he not
<PB N="130" REF="130"/>
gained immortality by a still nobler exertion of his mental powers, in defending the liberties of his country against the tyranny of Rome. On the first attack of Pope Paul V. on two laws of Ve∣nice, very wisely framed to correct the abuses of the clergy, Fa∣ther Paul arose as the literary champion of the Republic, and de∣fended its cause with great spirit and temper, in various composi∣tions; though he is said not to be Author of the Treatise ge∣nerally ascribed to him on the occasion, and entitled, <HI>The Rights of Sovereigns,</HI> &amp;c.—His chief performance on the subject was <HI>Con∣siderazioni sopra le Censure di Paolo V.</HI> The Venetians shewed a just admiration of the sublime virtue of a Monk, who defended so nobly the civil rights of his country against the separate interest of the church. In 1606 the Council passed a decree in his favour; which I shall transcribe in this note, because it is not found in the common Lives of Father Paul, and because there is hardly any object more pleasing to the mind, than the contemplation of a free state rewarding one of its most virtuous servants with liberality and esteem.—Continuando il R. P. M. Paolo da Venezia dell ordine de Serviti a prestare alla Signoria Nostra con singolar Valore quell ottimo servigio, ch' è ben conosciuto, potendosi dire, ch' egli fra tutti con le sue scritture piene di profonda dottrina sostenti con va∣lidissimi fondamenti le potentissime e validissime ragioni nostre nella causa, che ha di presente la Repubblica con la corte di Roma, anteponende il servigio e la soddisfazione nostra a qual∣sivoglia suo particolare ed importante rispetto. E perciò cosa giusta e ragionevole, e degna dell ordinaria munificenza di questo Consiglio, il dargli modo, con che possa assicurare la sua Vita da ogni pericolo, che gli potesse soprastare, e sovvenire insieme alli suoi bisogni, bench, egli non ne faccia alcuna istanza, ma piutosto si mostri alieno da qualsivoglia ricognizione, che si abbia intenzione di usargli. Tal è la sua modestia, e cosi grande il desiderio, che ha di far conoscere, che nessuna pretensione di premio, ma la sola divozione sua verso la Repubblica, e lagiustizia della Causa lo muo∣vano

Paolo da Ve∣nezia di Ducati duecento all anno, siano accresciuti altri ducati due∣cento, sicchè in avvenire abbia ducati quattrocento, acciòchè res∣tando consolato per questa spontanea e benigna dimostrazione pub∣blica, con maggior ardore abbia a continuare nel suo buono e divoto servizio, e possa con questo assequamento provvedere maggiormente alia sicurezza della sua Vita.—The generous care of the Republic to reward and preserve so valuable a servant, could not secure him from the base attempts of that enemy, whom his virtue had pro∣voked. In 1607, after Venice had adjusted her disputes with Rome, by the mediation of France, the first attack was made on the life of Father Paul. He was beset near his convent, in the evening, by five assassins, who stabbed him in many places, and left him for dead. He recovered, under the care of the celebrated Acquapen∣dente, appointed to attend him at the public charge; to whom, as he was speaking on the depth of the principal wound, his patient said pleasantly, that the world imputed it stylo Romanae Curiae.— The crime is generally supposed to have proceeded from the Jesuits; but the secret authors of it were never clearly discovered, though the five ruffians were traced by the Venetian Ambassador in Rome, where they are said to have been well received at first, but failing afterwards in their expected reward, to have perished in misery and want. The Senate of Venice paid such attention to Father Paul, as expressed the highest sense of his merit, and the most affectionate solicitude for his safety. They not only doubled his stipend a se∣cond time, but entreated him to chuse a public residence, for the greater security of his person. The munificence and care of the Republic was equalled by the modesty and fortitude of their ser∣vant. He chose not to relinquish his cell; and, though warned of various machinations against his life, he continued to serve his country with unabating zeal; discovering, in his private letters to
<PB N="132" REF="132"/>
his friends, the most heroic calmness of mind, and saying, in answer to their admonitions, that "no man lives well, who is too anxious for the preservation of life."—Yet the apprehensions of his friends had too just a foundation. In 1609 another conspiracy was formed, to murder him in his sleep, by some persons of his own convent—but their treachery was happily discovered.—From this time he lived in more cautious retirement, still devoting himself to the service of the Republic on various occasions, and acquiring new reputation by many compositions. At the length the world was sur∣prized by his History of the Council of Trent, first published at London, 1619; with the fictitious name of Pietro Soave Polano; and dedicated to James the Ist, by Antonio de Dominis, the cele∣brated Archbishop of Spalatto, who speaks of the concealed Author as his intimate friend, who had entrusted him with a manuscript, on which his modesty set a trifling value, but which it seemed pro∣per to bestow upon the world even without his consent.—The mystery concerning the publication of this noble work has never been thoroughly cleared up, and various falsities concerning it have been reported by author of considerable reputation.—It has even been said that James the Ist had some share in the composition of the book—if he had, it was probably in forming the name Pietro Soave Polano, which is an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneziano, and the only part of the book which bears any relation to the style or taste of that Monarch.—Father Paul was soon supposed to be the real Author of the work in question. The Prince of Condé, on a visit to his cloyster, expressly asked him, if he was so—to which he modestly replied, that at Rome it was well known who had written it.—He enjoyed not many years the reputation arising from this masterly production—in 1623 a fever occasioned his death, which was even more exemplary and sublime than his life itself. —He prepared himself for approaching dissolution with the most devout composure, and, as the liberty of his country was the dar∣ling object of his exalted mind, he prayed for its preservation
<PB N="133" REF="133"/>
with his last breath, in the two celebrated words Esto Per∣petua.</P>
<P>There is a singular beauty in the character of Father Paul, which is not only uncommon in his profession, but is rarely found in human nature.—Though he passed a long life in controversy of the most exasperating kind, and was continually attacked in every manner that malignity could suggest, both his writings and his heart appeared perfectly free from a vindictive spirit—devoting all the powers of his mind to the defence of the public cause, he seemed entirely to forget the injuries that were perpetually offered to his own person and reputation.</P>
<P>His constitution was extremely delicate, and his intense applica∣tion exposed him to very frequent and violent disorders: these he greatly remedied by his singular temperance, living chiefly on bread, fruits, and water.—This imperfect account of a character deserving the noblest elogium, is principally extracted from an oc∣tavo volume, entitled, Memoire Anedote spettanti a F. Paolo da Francesco Griselini Veneziano, &amp;c. edit. 2d, 1760. The author of this elaborate work has pointed out several mistakes in the French and English accounts of Father Paul; particularly in the anecdotes related of him by Burnet, in his Life of Bishop Bedell, and by Mr. Brent, the son of his English Translator.—Some of these had indeed been observed before by Writers of our own.—See the General Dictionary under the article Father Paul.—For the length and for the deficiencies of this Note, I am tempted to apo∣logize with a sentence borrowed from the great Historian who is the subject of it:—Chi mi osserverà in alcuni tempi abondare, in altri andar ristretto, si ricordi che non tutti i campi sono di ugnal fertilità, ne tutti li grani meritano d'esser conservati, e di quelli che il mietitore vorrebbe tenerne conto, qualche spica aneo sfugge la presa della mano, o il filo della falce, cosi comportando la con∣ditione d'ogni mietitura che resti anco parte per rispigolare.</P>

<P><HI>The clear Osorius, in his classic phrase.</HI>] Jerom Osorius was born of a noble family at Lisbon, 1506. He was educated at the university of Salamanca, and afterwards studied at Paris and Bologna. On his return to Portugal, he gradually rose to the Bishopric of Sylves, to which he was appointed by Catherine of Austria, Regent of the kingdom in the minority of Sebastian. At the request of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, he wrote his History of King Emanuel, and the expedition of Gama—which his great contemporary Camoens made at the same time the subject of his immortal Lusiad; a poem which has at length appeared with due lustre in our language, be∣ing translated with great spirit and elegance by Mr. Mickle. It is remarkable, that the History of Osorius, and the Epic Poem of Camoens, were published in the same year, 1572: but the fate of these two great Authors was very different; the Poet was suffered to perish in poverty, under the reign of that Henry, who patronized the Historian: yet, allowing for the difference of their professions, I am inclined to think they possessed a similarity of mind. There appear many traces of that high heroic spirit, even in the Priest Osorius, which animated the Soldier Camoens: particularly in the pleasure, with which he seems to describe the martial manners of his countrymen, under the reign of Emanuel.—Illius aetate (says the Historian, in the close of his manly work) inopia in exilium pulsa videbatur: maestitiae locus non erat: querimoniae silebant: omnia choreis &amp; cantibus personabant: ejusmodi ludis aula regia frequenter oblectabatur. Nobiles adolescentes cum virginibus re∣giis in aulâ sine ulla libidinis significatione saltabant, et quamvis honestissimis amoribus indulgerent, virginibus erat insitum, nemi∣nem ad familiaritatem admittere, nisi illum qui aliquid fortiter &amp; animose bellicis in rebus effecisset. Pueris enim nobilibus, qui in aula regia versabantur, non erat licitum pallium virile sumere,

antequam in Africam trajicerent &amp; aliquod inde decus egregium re∣portarent. Et his quidem moribus erat illius temporis nobilitas instituta, ut multi ex illius domo viri omni laude cumulati prodi∣rent.—This is a striking picture of the manners of chivalry, to which Portugal owed much of its glory in that splendid period. There is one particular in the character of Osorius, which, consi∣dering his age and country, deserves the highest encomium; I mean his tolerating spirit. In the first book of his History, he speaks of Emanuel's cruel persecution of the Jews in the following generous and exalted language:—Fuit quidem hoc nec ex lege nec ex religione factum. Quid enim? Tu rebelles animos nullaque ad id suscepta religione constrictos, adigas ad credendum ea, quae summa conten∣tione aspernantur &amp; respuunt? Idque tibi assumas, ut libertatem voluntatis impedias, &amp; vincula mentibus effraenatis injicias? at id neque fiori potest, neque Christi sanctissimum numen approbat. Voluntarium enim sacrificium, non vi et malo coactum ab homini∣bus expetit, neque vim mentibus inferri sed voluntates ad studium verae religionis allici &amp; invitari jubet. . . . . Postremo quis non vi∣det. . . . . . et ita religionem per religionis simulationem undignissi∣me violari?—Osorius is said to have used many arguments to dis∣suade Sebastian from his unfortunate expedition into Africa, and to have felt so deeply the miseries which befell the Portugueze after that fatal event, that his grief was supposed to accelerate his death.— He expired in 1580, happy, says De Thou (who celebrates him as a model of Christian virtue) that he died just before the Spanish army entered Portugal, and thus escaped being a witness to the de∣solation of his country.—His various works were published at Rome in 1592, by his nephew Osorius, in four volumes folio, with a Life of their Author. Among these are two remarkable productions; the first, an admonition to our Queen Elizabeth, ex∣horting her to return into the Church of Rome: the second, an Essay on Glory, written with such classical purity, as to give
<PB N="136" REF="136"/>
birth to a report, that it was not the composition of Osorius, but the lost work of Cicero on that subject.</P>

<P><HI>An equal wreath to Mariana's brow.</HI>] John Mariana was born 1537, at Talavera (a town in the diocese of Toledo) as he himself informs us in his famous Essay <HI>de Rege,</HI> which opens with a beau∣tiful romantic description of a sequestered spot in that neighbour∣hood, where he enjoyed the pleasures of literary retirement with his friend Calderon, a Minister of Toledo; whose death he mentions in the same Essay, commemorating his learning and his virtues in the most pleasing terms of affectionate admiration.—Mariana was admitted into the order of Jesuits at the age of 17. He travelled afterwards into Italy and France, and returning into Spain in 1574, settled at Toledo, and died there in the 87th year of his age, 1624. —Hearing it frequently regretted, in the course of his travels, that there was no General History of his country, he engaged in that great work on his return; and published it in Latin at Toledo, 1592, with a dedication to Philip the IId; where he speaks of his own performance with modesty and manly freedom, and perhaps with as little flattery as ever appeared in any address of that na∣ture, to a Monarch continually fed with the grossest adulation.— This elaborate work he translated into Spanish, but, as he himself declares, with all the freedom of an original author. He published his Version in 1601, with an address to Philip the IIId, in which he laments the decline of Learning in his country, and declares he had himself executed that work from his apprehension of its being mangled by an ignorant Translator. He had closed his His∣tory (which begins with the first peopling of Spain) with the death of Ferdinand, in 1516; but in a subsequent edition, in 1617,
<PB N="137" REF="137"/>
he added to it a short summary of events to the year 1612: but in the year before he first published the Spanish Version of his His∣tory, he addressed also, to the young Monarch Philip the IIId, his famous Essay, which I have mentioned, and which was publicly burnt at Paris, about 20 years after its publication, on the suppo∣sition that it had excited Ravaillac to the murder of Henry the IVth; though it was asserted, with great probability, by the Je∣suits, that the Assassin had never seen the book.—It is true, indeed, that Mariana, in this Essay, occasionally defends Clement the Monk, who stabbed Henry the IIId; and it is very remarkable, that he grounds this defence, not on the bigotted tenets of a Priest, who thinks every thing lawful for the interest of his church, but on those sublime principles of civil liberty, with which an antient Ro∣man would have vindicated the dagger of Brutus. Indeed, this Essay contains some passages on Government, which would not have dishonoured even Cicero himself; but, it must be owned, they are grievously disgraced by the last chapter of the Work, which breathes a furious spirit of ecclesiastical intolerance, and yet closes with these mild and modest expressions: Nostrum de regno et Regis institutione judicium fortasse non omnibus placeat; qui volet se∣quatur, aut suo potius stet, si potioribus argumentis nitatur, de quibus rebus tantopere asseveravi in his libris, eas nunquam veriores quam alienam sententiam affirmabo. Potest enim non solum mihi aliud, aliud aliis videri, sed et mihi ipsi alio tempore. Suam quis∣que sententiam per me sequatur . . . et . . qui nostra leget . . . me∣mor conditionis humanae, si quid erratum est, pio studio rempub∣licam juvandi veniam benignus concedat et facilis.—This is not the only work of Mariana which fell under a public proscription; he was himself persecuted, and suffered a year's imprisonment, for a treatise, which seems to have been dictated by the purest love to his country; it was against the pernicious practice of debasing the public coin, and as it was supposed to reflect on the Duke of Ler∣ma, called the Sejanus of Spain, it exposed the Author, about the
<PB N="138" REF="138"/>
year 1609, to the persecution of that vindictive Minister; from which it does not appear how he escaped.—Indeed the accounts of Mariana's life are very imperfect: Bayle, whom I have chiefly fol∣lowed, mentions a life of him by De Vargas, which he could not procure. I have sought after this Biographer with the same ill success, as I wished to give a more perfect account of this great Author, whose personal History is little known among us, though it is far from being unworthy of attention.</P>

<P><HI>The liberal spirit of Thuanus rose.</HI>] James Augustus De Thou was the youngest son of Christopher De Thou, First President of the Parliament of Paris, and born in that city, 1553. His own Me∣moirs give a pleasing account of the early activity of his mind.— As his health, during his childhood, was so tender and infirm, that his parents rather restrained him from the usual studies of his age, he devoted much of his time to drawing, and copied with a pen the engravings of Albert Durer, before he was ten years old. At that age he was settled in the college of Burgundy; but this plan of his education was soon interrupted by a fever, in which his life was despaired of, and in which the mother of his future friend, the Duke of Montpensier, watched him with an attention singularly happy, after his physicians and his parents had considered him as dead. In a few years after his recovery, he repaired to Or∣leans to study the civil law; from thence he was drawn to Valence in Dauphiny, by the reputation of Cujacius, who was then reading lectures there; on his road he embraced an opportunity of hearing Hotoman, the celebrated author of Franco-Gallia, who was read∣ing lectures also at Bourges.—During his residence at Valence, he contracted a friendship with Joseph Scaliger, which he cultivated through life.—In 1572, his father recalled him to Paris, just be∣fore the massacre of St. Bartholomew.—He mentions in his Me∣moirs
<PB N="139" REF="139"/>
the horrors which he felt in seeing a very small part of that bloody scene!—He resided in the house of his uncle Nicholas De Thou, promoted to the bishopric of Chartres: he was then designed himself for the church; and, beginning to collect his celebrated library, applied himself particularly to the Civil Law, and to Gre∣cian literature.</P>
<P>He travelled into Italy in 1573, with Paul De Foix, going on an embassy to the Pope and the Italian Princes. Of De Foix, he gives the most engaging character, and speaks with great pleasure of the literary entertainment and advantages which he derived from this expedition.—He returned to Paris, and devoted himself again to his studies, in the following year.—On the dissentions in the Court of France, in 1576, he was employed to negotiate with the Mareschal Montmorency, and engage him to interpose his good offices to pre∣vent the civil war; which he for some time effected.—The same year he visited the Low Countries, and on his return was appointed to a public office, on which he entered with that extreme diffidence which is so natural to a delicate mind.</P>
<P>In 1579 he travelled again, with his elder brother, who was sent by his physicians to the baths of Plombieres in Lorrain: from hence he made a short excursion into Germany, and was received there with the jovial hospitality of that country, which he describes in a very lively manner.—But affection soon recalled him to Plom∣bieres, to attend his infirm brother to Paris, who died there in a few months after their return.</P>
<P>In 1580, on the plague's appearing in the capital, our Historian retired into Touraine, and after visiting the principal places in Normandy, returned to Paris in the winter.—In the following year, he was of the number chosen from the Parliament of Paris to administer justice in Guienne, as two ecclesiastics were included in that commission.—In this expedition he embraced every oppor∣tunity of preparing the materials of his History, seeking, as he ever did, the society of all persons eminent for their talents, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="140" REF="140"/>
capable of giving him any useful information. He speaks with great pleasure of a visit which be paid of this time to the celebrated Montaigne, whom he calls a man of a most liberal mind, and to∣tally uninfected with the spirit of party.—After various excursions, he was now returning to Paris, when he received the unexpected news of his father's death, an event which affected him most deeply, as filial affection was one of the striking characteristics of his amia∣ble mind.—He consoled himself under the affliction of having been unable to pay his duty to his dying parent, by erecting a magnifi∣cent monument to his memory, expressive of the high veneration in which he ever held his virtues.—He engaged again in public business, devoting his intervals of leisure to mathematical studies, and to the composition of Latin verse, which seems to have been his favourite amusement. In 1584, he published his Poem, de re Accipitraria, which, though much celebrated by the critics of his age, has fallen, like the subject of which it treats, into universal neglect.—In 1585, he bid adieu to the Court, on finding himself treated with such a degree of coldness, as his ingenuous nature could not submit to; and being eager to advance in his great work, which he had already brought down to the reign of Francis II.— In 1587, having been often pressed to marry by his family, and being absolved from his ecclesiastical engagements for that purpose, he made choice of Marie Barbanson, of an antient and noble fa∣mily; but as her parents were suspected of a secret inclination to the reformed religion, it was thought proper that the lady should undergo a kind of expiation in a private conference with two Ca∣tholic Divines; a circumstance of which the great Historian speaks with an air of triumph in his Memoirs, as a proof of his own in∣violable attachment to the faith of his fathers. In 1588, he lost his affectionate mother; who is described, by her son, as meeting death with the same gentleness and tranquillity of mind, by which her life was distinguished. When the violence of the league had reduced Henry the IIId to abandon Paris, our Historian was sent
<PB N="141" REF="141"/>
into Normandy to confirm the magistrates of that province in their adherence to the King.—He afterwards met Henry at Blois, and while he was receiving from him in private some commissions to execute at Paris, the King pressed his hand, and seemed preparing to impart to him some important secret; but after a long pause dis∣missed him without revealing it.—This secret was afterwards sup∣posed to have been the projected assassination of the Duke of Guise: the supposition is probable, and it is also probable, that if Henry had then revealed his design, the manly virtue and eloquence of De Thou might have led him to relinquish that infamous and fatal measure.—He was, however, so far from suspecting the intended crime of the King, that when he first heard at Paris, that Guise was assassinated, he believed it a false rumour, only spread by that faction, to introduce, what he supposed had really happened, the murder of the King.—In the commotions which the death of Guise produced in Paris, many insults were offered to the family of De Thou: his wife was imprisoned for a day in the Bastile; but ob∣taining her liberty, she escaped from the city in a mean habit, at∣tended by her husband, disguised also in the dress of a soldier. Hav∣ing sent his wife in safety into Picardy, he repaired to the King, who was almost deserted, at Blois; and was greatly instrumental in persuading his master to his coalition with Henry of Navarre.— The King determined to establish a Parliament at Tours, and De Thou was considered as the most proper person to be the President of this assembly; but with his usual modesty he declined this honour, and chose rather to engage with his friend Mr. de Schom∣berg, in an expedition to Germany for the service of the King.— He was at first designed for the embassy to Elizabeth, but at the request of Schomberg declined the appointment, and accompanied his friend.</P>
<P>He first received intelligence of the King's death at Venice, where he had formed an intimacy with the celebrated Arnauld d'Ossat, at that time Secretary to the Cardinal Joyeuse.—In con∣sequence
<PB N="142" REF="142"/>
of their conversation on this event, and the calamities of France, De Thou addressed a Latin Poem to his friend, which he afterwards printed at Tours.</P>
<P>In leaving Italy, he passed a few days at Padua, with his friend Vicenzio Pinelli; from whom he collected many particulars con∣cerning the most eminent Italian and Spanish Authors, whom he determined to celebrate in his History, in the hope, as he honestly confesses, that his liberal attention to foreign merit might entitle his own Works to the favour both of Italy and Spain; but he was disappointed in this fair expectation, and laments the ingratitude which he experienced from both.</P>
<P>On his return to France, he was graciously received by Henry the IVth; and in giving that Prince an account of Italy, suggested to him the idea of a connexion with Mary of Medicis. After the battle of Ivry, he complimented the King in a short Poem, which closes with the following lines:
<Q><L>Auspiciis vulgo peraguntur praelia regum,</L>
<L>Perque duces illis gloria multa venit:</L>
<L>Tu vincis virtute tua, nec militis haec est;</L>
<L>Ista tibi propria laurea parta manu.</L></Q>
As he was travelling, soon afterwards, with his wife and family, which he designed to settle at Tours, his party was intercepted by the enemy, and he was obliged to abandon his wife and her atten∣dants, being prevailed on by their intreaties to secure his own escape by the swiftness of his horse.—He repaired to the King at Gisors, and soon obtained the restitution of his family.—On the death of Amyot, Bishop of Auxerre, well known by his various Translations from the Greek language, the King appointed De Thou his Principal Librarian. In 1592, our Historian was very near failing a victim to the plague, but happily struggled through that dangerous distemper by the assistance of two skilful physicians, who

attended him at Tours.—In 1593, he began the most important part of his History; and under this year he introduces in his Memoirs a long and spirited Poem addressed to Posterity, in which he enters into a justification of himself against the malignant attacks, which the manly and virtuous freedom of his writings had drawn upon him. It concludes with the following animated appeal to the spi∣rit of his father:
<Q><L>Vos O majorum Cineres, teque optime longis</L>
<L>Soliciti genitor defuncte laboribus aevi,</L>
<L>Testor, pro patria nullas regnique salute</L>
<L>Vitavisse vices, vestra virtute meaque</L>
<L>Indignum nil fecisse, et si fata tulissent,</L>
<L>Prodessem ut patriae, patriae succurrere, livor</L>
<L>Absistat, pietate mea meruisse petenti.</L>

<L>Nostraque sub tacitos ibit fama integra manes.</L></Q></P>
<P>In 1594, he succeeded his uncle Augustin as President a Mor∣tier.—In 1596, he lost his valuable and learned friend Pithou, who first solicited him to undertake his History, and had greatly assisted him in the prosecution of that laborious work.—How deeply the affectionate mind of De Thou was wounded by this event, appears from his long letter to Casaubon on the occasion.—In 1597, he be∣gan to be engaged in those negotiations, which happily terminated in the famous edict of Nantes.—It may be proper to observe here, that De Thou was accused of being a Calvinist, in consequence of the part he acted in this business, as well as from the moderate tenor of his History; and it is remarkable, that Sully seems in his Memoirs to countenance the accusation.</P>
<P>In 1601, our Historian suffered a severe domestic affliction in the loss of his wife.—He celebrated her virtues, and his own con∣nubial
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
affection, in a Latin Poem: with this, and a Greek epitaph on the same lady, written by Casaubon, he terminates the Com∣mentary of his own Life, of which the preceding account is an imperfect abridgment.—His first wife leaving him no children, he married, in 1603, Gasparde de la Chastre, an accomplished lady of a noble family; who having brought him three sons and three daughters, died at the age of 39, 1616.—There is a fine letter of Daniel Heinsius, addressed to our author on this occasion, exhorting him to fortitude: but this unexpected domestic calamity, and the miseries which befel his country on the murder of Henry the Great, are said to have wounded his feeling mind so deeply, as to occasion his death, which happened in May 1617.—Under the re∣gency of Mary of Medicis, he had been one of the Directors ge∣neral of the finances, maintaining the same reputation for integrity in that department, which he had ever preserved in his judicial capacity.</P>
<P>The first part of his History appeared in 1604, with a Preface addressed to Henry IV, justly celebrated for its liberal and manly spirit.—But I must observe, that the following compliment to the King—Quicquid de ea statueris jusserisve, pro divinae vocis oraculo mihi erit—was more than even that most amiable of Monarchs de∣served, as he ungratefully deserted the cause of our Historian, in suffering his work to be proscribed by the public censure of Rome in 1609, as De Thou plainly intimates, in the following passage from one of his letters, written 1611:—Publicata prima parte [His∣toriae meae] immane quam commoti sunt plerique, sive invidi, sive factiosi, qui mox proceres quosdam, qui per se in talibus rebus nihil vident, per calumnias artificiose confictas, ut scis, in me concita∣verunt, remque e vestigio Romam detulerunt, et auctore maligne exagitato, facile pervicerunt, ut morosi illi censores omnia mea sinistre▪ interpretarentur, et praejudicio personae opus integrum, cujus ne tertiam quidem partem legerant, praecipitato ordine damnarent. Rex causam meam initio quidem tuebatur, quamdiu
<PB N="145" REF="145"/>
proceres in aula infestos habui. Sed paulatim ipse eorundem astu infractus est; cognitoque Romae per emissarios labare regem, post Ossati et Serafini Cardinalium mihi amicissimorum obitum, et illus∣trissimi Perronii ex urbe discessum, ictus postremo in me directus est, qui facile vitari potuit, si qui circa regem erant, tantae injuriae sensum ad se ac regni dignitatem pertinere vel minima significatione prae se tulissent. Ita in aula omni ope destitutus, facile Romae op∣pressus sum.—De Thou was preparing a new edition of his His∣tory at the time, of his death.—His passion for Latin verse appears never to have forsaken him, as the latest effusion of his pen was a little poem descriptive of his last illness, and an epitaph in which he draws the following just character of himself:
<Q><L>Mihi veritatis cura vitae commodis</L>
<L>Antiquiorque charitatibus fuit,</L>
<L>Nullique facto, voce nulli injurius,</L>
<L>Injurias patienter aliorum tuli.</L>
<L>Tu quisquis es, qualisque, quantusque, O bone,</L>
<L>Si cura veri est ulla, si pietas movet,</L>
<L>A me meisque injuriam, quaeso, abstine.</L></Q></P>
<P>The pious paternal prayer in the last line was very far from being crowned with success. Francis, the eldest son of De Thou, fell a victim to the resentment which Cardinal Richelieu is said to have conceived against him, from a passage in the great Historian, reflecting on the Richelieu family.—He was beheaded at Lyons, 1642, for having been privy to a conspiracy against the Cardinal. —Voltaire, with his usual philanthropy and spirit, inveighs against the iniquity of this execution, in his Melanges, tom. iii.—The cu∣rious reader may find a particular account of this tragical event in the last volume of that noble edition of Thuanus, which was pub∣lished under the auspices of Dr. Mead, and does great honour to

our country.—I shall close this Note by transcribing from it the following spirited epitaph on the unfortunate victim.</P>

<P><HI>Thy Wits, O France! (as ev'n thy Critics own)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Support not History's majestic tone.</HI>] To avoid every appearance of national prejudice, I shall quote on this occasion some passages from a very liberal French Critic, who has passed the same judgment on the Historians of his country. The Marquis d'Argenson, in a me∣moir read before the French Academy, 1755, not only confesses that the French Writers have failed in History, but even ventures to explain the cause of their ill success.</P>
<P>Nous avons, says he, quelques morceaux, ou l'on trouve tout à la fois la fidelité, le gout, et le vrai ton de l'Histoire; mais outre qu'ils sont en petit nombre, et tres-courts, les auteurs, à qui nous en sommes redevables, se sont defié de leurs forces; ils ont craint de manquer d'haleine dans des ouvrages de plus longue étendue.</P>
<P>Pourquoi les anciens ont-ils eu des Thucydides, des Xenophons, des Polybes, &amp; des Tacites? pourquoi ne pouvons nous leur com∣parer que des St. Réals, des Vertots, des Sarrasins? nous ne devons point attribuer cette disette à la decadence de l'Esprit humain. Il

<P N="2">2. Une grande profendeur en morale &amp; en politique.</P>
<P N="3">3. Une imagination sage, &amp; fleurie, qui peigne les actions, qui deduise les causes, &amp; qui presente les reflexions avec clarté &amp; sim∣plicité; quelquefois avec feu, mais toujours avec gout &amp; élé∣gance.</P>
<P N="4">4. Il faut de plus la constance dans le travail, un style égal &amp; soutenu, &amp; une exactitude infatigable, qui ne montre jamais l'im∣patience d'avancer, ni de lassitude pendant le cours d'une longue carrière.</P>

Mais qu'on cherche ces qualités rassemblées, on manquera d'exemples, à citer entre nos Auteurs.—The critic then takes a rapid review of the French Historians, and proceeds to make the following lively remarks on the difficulty of writing History in France, and the vo∣latile character of his countrymen—J'ai dejà prévenu l'une des plus grandes difficultés pour les auteurs; ils devroient etre en meme tems hommes de cabinet &amp; hommes du monde.

<HEAD>NOTE I. VERSE 30.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AND shake th' affrighted world with dire portents.</HI>] There is ae curious treatise of Dr. Warburton's on this subject, which is become very scarce; it is entitled, <Q>A critical and philosophical En∣quiry into the causes of prodigies and miracles, as related by Histo∣rians, with an Essay towards restoring a method and purity in His∣tory.</Q> It contains, like most of the compositions of this dogmatical Writer, a strange mixture of judicious criticism and entertaining absurdity, in a style so extraordinary, that I think the following specimens of it may amuse a reader, who has not happened to meet with this singular book.—Having celebrated Rawleigh and Hyde, as writers of true historic genius, he adds: "almost all the rest of our Histories want Life, Soul, Shape, and Body: a mere hodge∣podge of abortive embryos and rotten carcases, kept in an unna∣tural ferment (which the vulgar mistake for real life) by the rank leven of prodigies and portents. Which can't but afford good
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
diversion to the Critic, while he observes how naturally one of their own fables is here mythologiz'd and explain'd, <HI>of a church-yard carcase, raised and set a strutting by the inflation of some hellish suc∣cubus within."</HI> He then passes a heavy censure on the antiqua∣rian publications of Thomas Hearne; in the close of which he ex∣claims—"Wonder not, reader, at the view of these extravagancies. The Historic Muse, after much vain longing for a vigorous adorer, is now fallen under that indisposition of her sex, so well known by a depraved appetite for trash and cinders."—Having quoted two passages from this singular Critic, in which his metaphorical lan∣guage is exceedingly gross, candour obliges me to transcribe ano∣ther, which is no less remarkable for elegance and beauty of ex∣pression. In describing Sallust, at one time the loud advocate of public spirit, and afterwards sharing in he robberies of Caesar, he expresses this variation of character by the following imagery;— "No sooner did the warm aspect of good fortune shine out again, but all those exalted ideas of virtue and honour, raised like a beau∣tiful kind of frost-work, in the cold season of adversity, dissolved and disappeared.</P>

<P><HI>On Francio now the Gallic page is mute,</HI></P>
<P><HI>And British Story drops the name of Brute.</HI>] The origin of the French nation was ascribed by one of the Monkish Historians to Francio, a son of Priam: Mr. Warton, who mentions this circum∣stance in his Dissertation on the origin of romantic fiction in Europe, supposes that the revival of Virgil's Aeneid, about the sixth or se∣venth century, inspired many nations with this chimerical ides of tracing their descent from the family of Priam. There is a very remarkable proof in the Historian Matthew of Westminster, how fond the English were of considering themselves as the descendants
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
of the Trojan Brutus. In a letter from Edward the First to Pope Boniface, concerning the affairs of Scotland, the King boasts of his Trojan predecessor in the following terms:—Sub temporibus itaque Ely &amp; Samuelis prophetarum, vir quidam strenuus et insignis, Brutus nomie, de genere Trojanorum, post excidium urbis Trojanae cum multis nobilibus Trojanorum applicuit in quandam Insulam tunc Albion vocatam, a gigantibus inhabitatam, quibus sua et suo∣rum seductis potentia et occìsis, eam nomine suo Britanniam soci∣osque suos Britannos appellavit, &amp; aedificavit civitatem quam Tri∣novantum nuncupavit, quae modo Londinum nuncupatur.</P>

<P><HI>And Bacon's self, for mental glory born,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Meets, as her slave, our pity, or our scorn.</HI>] I wish not to dwell invidiously on the failings of this immortal Genius; but it may be useful to remark, that no Historical work, though executed by a man of the highest mental abilities, can obtain a lasting reputation, if it be planned and written with a servility of spirit.—This was evidently the case in Bacon's History of Henry the VIIth: it was the first work he engaged in after his disgrace, and laid as a peace-offering at the feet of his master, the despicable James, who affected to consider his great grandfather, the abject and avaricious Henry, as the model of a King. It was therefore the aim of the unfortu∣nate Historian to flatter this phantasy of the royal pedant, for whom he wrote, and he accordingly formed a colossal statue to represent a pigmy.—It is matter of astonishment that Lord Bolingbroke, who in his political works has written on the vices of this very King, with a force and beauty so superior to the History in question, should speak of it as a work possessing merit sufficient to bear a comparison with the antients: on the contrary, the extreme awk∣wardness
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
of the task, which the Historian imposed upon himself, gave a weakness and embarrassment to his style, which in his nobler works is clear, nervous, and manly. This will particularly ap∣pear from a few lines in his character of Henry.—"This King, to speak of him in terms equal to his deserving, was one of the best sort of wonders, a wonder for wise men. He had parts, both in his virtues and his fortune, not so fit for a common-place as for observation.....His worth may bear a tale of two, that may put upon him somewhat, that may seem divine,"—He then relates a dream of Henry's mother, the Lady Margaret: but the quotations I have made may be sufficient to justify my remark; and, as Dr. Johnson says happily of Milton, "What Englishman can take delight in transcribing passages, which, if they lessen the re∣putation of Bacon, diminish in some degree the honour of our country?"</P>

<P>The Critics are much divided on this passage: I have followed an interpretation very different from that adopted by a learned and judicious author, who has lately entered into a thorough discussion of all the anecdotes relating to this celebrated Conqueror, in a very elaborate and spirited dissertation, entitled, "Examen critique des Historiens d'Alexandre," Paris, 4to, 1775. But there is great probability in his conjecture, that the name of Aristobulus has slipt into the story by some mistake; and that the sycophant so justly reprimanded was Onesicritus, who attended the hero of Ma∣cedon in quality of Historiographer, and is censured by the judi∣cious Strabo as the most fabulous of all the Writers who have engaged in his History.

<P><HI>In Dedications quietly inurn'd,</HI></P>
<P><HI>They take more lying Praise than Ammon spurn'd.</HI>] As History is the composition most frequently addressed to Princes, modern His∣torians have been peculiarly tempted to this kind of adulation.— Indeed Dedications in general are but too commonly a disgrace to letters. Perhaps a concise History of this species of writing, and the fate of some remarkable Dedicators, might have a good influence towards correcting that prostitution of talents, which is so often observed in productions of this nature; and such a work might be very amusing to the lovers of literary anecdote.—The two most un∣fortunate Dedications that occur to my remembrance, were written by Joshua Barnes, and Dr. Pearce, late Bishop of Rochester: The first dedicated his History of Edward the IIId, to James the IId, and unluckily compared that Monarch to the most valiant of his
<PB N="154" REF="154"/>
predecessors, just before his timidity led him to abdicate the throne: the second dedicated his edition of Tully de Oratore to Lord Mac∣clesfield, and as unluckily celebrated his patron as a model of pub∣lic virtue, not many years before he was impeached in parliament, and fined £. 30,000 for the iniquity of his conduct in the office of Chancellor.</P>

<P><HI>Still can Herrera, mourning o'er his urn,</HI></P>
<P><HI>His dying pangs to blissful rapture turn.</HI>] Antonio de Herrera, a Spanish Historian of great reputation, describes the death of Phi∣lip II. in the following terms:—"Y fue cosa de notar, que aviendo dos, o tres horas antes que espirasse, tenido un paraxismo tan violento, que le tuvieron por acabado, cubriendole el rostro con un panno, abrio los ojos con gran espiritu, y tomò el crucifixo de mano de Don Hernando de Toledo, y con gran devocion, y ternura le besò muchas vozes, y a la imagen de nuestra Sennora de Monserrate, que estava en la candela. Pareciò al Arçobispo de Toledo, a los confessores, y a quantos se hallaron presentes, que era impossible, que naturalmente huviesse podido bolver tan presto, y con tan vivo espiritu, sino que devio de tener en aquel punto alguna vision y favor del cielo, y que mas fue rapto que paraxismo: luego bolviô al agonia, y se fue acabando poco a poco, y con pequenno movimiento se le arrancò el alma, domingo a treze de Setiembre a las cinco horas de la mannana, siendo sus ultimas palabras, que moria como Catolico en la Fê y obediencia de la santa Iglesia Romana; y assi acabò este gran Monarca con la misma prudencia con que vivio: por lo qual (meritamente) fe le dio el atributo de prudente.</P>

<P>After speaking so freely on the vices of this Monarch, it is but just to observe, that Philip, who possessed all the sedate cruelty

of the cold-blooded Octavius, resembled him also in one amiable quality, and was so much a friend to letters, that his reign may be considered as the Augustan age of Spanish literature.—His most bloody minister, the merciless Alva, was the Maecenas of that won∣derful and voluminous Poet, Lope de Vega. I cannot help re∣gretting that the two eminent Writers, who have lately delineated the reigns of Charles the Vth, and his Son Philip, so happily in our language, have entered so little into the literary History of those times.</P>

Fusius Calenus haranguing the Ro∣man senate against the great ornament of that assembly, calling Ci∣cero a magician, and accusing him of prostituting his wife, and committing incest with his daughter.
