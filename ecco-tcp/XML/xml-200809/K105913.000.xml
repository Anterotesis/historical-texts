<P>THE NOBLE PEASANT, A COMIC OPERA, IN THREE ACTS; AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN THE HAYMARKET.</P>
<P>BY THOMAS HOLCROFT.</P>
<P>DUBLIN: Printed by J. EXSHAW, for the COMPANY of BOOKSELLERS.</P>
<P>M DCC LXXXIV.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the ease and convenience of the Provincial Theatres, as well as to gra∣tify the Curiosity of the Reader, those Pas∣sages and Songs, which were omitted in the Representation, are put between inverted Commas. Scenes, which often are tedious in the Theatre, amuse in the Closet; and it would, perhaps, be an experiment not much to the advantage of most Theatrical Productions, to restore, on any Stage, Pas∣sages which, without great Experience, it would be difficult to give a reason, why they should not be restored.</P>
<P>The Fable relates to Times so remote, that the task of supporting dialogue, in which Wit is necessary, and yet of not of∣fending the manners of those Times, is no easy one. Glory is often acquired in pro∣portion as impediments are overcome: Far be it, however, from the Author to insi∣nuate in what degree he is intitled to this kind of praise; that Decision rests with the Public, and it cannot be in hands more equitable.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
Ambitious of deriving Fame from a source whence Fame has so often flowed, from Poetry, the Author has paid an attention to the Songs, which he hopes the Lovers of Poetry will approve. Should they really possess Excellence, it is still to be expected it must oftcn remain unnoticed. The Po∣etical Beauties of the Songs in the Duenna are frequently overlooked, but they are not therefore the less beautiful. In some in∣stances Poetry has here been obliged to give place to Situation and other Accidents, and pretends to no Charms.</P>
<P>To Mr. Shield, the Author of the Music, every Praise, every Respect is due! The universal Admiration he has received on this, as well as on various former occasions, must give Pleasure to every ingenuous mind: For who can forbear being happy at the prospe∣rity of a Man, whose Head and whose Heart are equally superior? The NOBLE PEASANT owes much, very much of its success to the Genius of the Musician. The Airs not only possess Sweetness and Originality, but they are learned likewise; and, what is far to be preferred, they have Passion and Enthusiasm: The very Accompaniments are full of these inestimable Qualities. If Friendship be not more than partial, the first Song in the third Act is, in particular, in all its Parts, worthy of the greatest Master Harmony ever in∣spired:
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
and yet, to single out this Song, on∣ly, is doing great injustice to the rest. There is little danger, indeed, in declaring such Opinions, for every one declares the same.</P>
<P>To all those whose Talents have contribut∣ed to the success of this Opera, from the greatest to the least, the Author returns his Thanks. He forbears to recite Names, be∣cause distinctions are difficult; and because he cannot, without an appearance of seeking to flatter, mention them with all the Respect he wishes, should he mention them at all.</P>

<P>Well said, and well sung, my merry hearts. But where's Leonard? Where's the valiant Stripling?—Does he not draw a good bow, Will? What think'st thou, Clym, isn't he a child of valour?</P>

<P>By my faith, he's no Flincher.</P>

<P>It must be a hard crown that the Youngster can't crack.</P>

<P>How furiously the rascal laid about him in the battle.</P>
</SP>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee what, Clym,—mercy forsake me if I would not rather encounter the sheriff and all his men, than be obliged, hand to hand, to fight this Leonard.</P>
</SP></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the Lord, he has an arm like the claws of a Lion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, boy, and he has a Lion's heart too. Did you see in the fight how he brought down that terma∣gant Dane, that man of might, that Alric—he that seemed determined to kill every body himself? How he died, grinding the dust, and cursing his heathen Gods, to be so baffled by a Boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and, as if Leonard car'd little for such a victory, he left another to take the spoil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, prithee, Will, who was that Knight that was so nimble at running away with the slain Alric's arms? I had not seen him before in the battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seen him!—No no—he'll take care nobody shall see him in any danger;—catch him there if you can—'Twas Earl Egbert.</P>

<P>Oh! what the foolish Braggart, that we have played pranks with him and his purse so often?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clym.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hark ye me, boys, tell me, you that can, what was the cause of this fray? for tho' I have been fighting, I hardly know what about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>About?—About a pair of blue eyes, two rosy cheeks, some certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of ivory teeth, with
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
various <HI>items</HI> and &amp; <HI>ceteras,</HI> all summed up in the word Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain, explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus—Anlaff, the Dane, meets, upon a certain day, with Edwitha, the daughter of Earl Wal∣ter and is amazed at her beauty—Well, Sir, finding▪ himself attacked by a terrible disease, called sighing, with dangerous symptoms, he demands me this same Lady fair in marriage, that he may be able to eat his beef as heretofore. Earl Walter, however, did not chuse his daughter should be the Dane's doctor in this case.</P>
</SP>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><SP>
<SPEAKER>Clym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?—Zounds, Clym, hast no religi∣on?—Dost not know that these Red-heads, these Carroty-poles,are Pagans?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn it, I had forgot that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>My freckle-faced gentleman takes this de∣nial in dudgeon; and turning on his heel, vows ven∣geance.—Now neither Earl Walter, nor his son Ha∣rold, are of the cuckow breed; they won't be peck∣ed at—so the issue of this no marriage was the bat∣tle in question.</P>
</SP></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will</SPEAKER>
<P>And Anlaff, instead of gaining a wise, has lost his brother Alric.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and some few more—we left some on their backs, that wont't be in a hurry to get up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, they may call us Outlaws if they please, but I say we are brave fellows; and if not the most honourable, we are at least as merry as our neighbours.</P>

<P>But let me tell you, my Hearts, Harold may thank US for the victory: That Anlaff, and his Red∣heads, and especially that Alric, with his two-handed sword, bestirred themselves so stoutly, that by the Lord, Lads, Harold's men were little better than Run-aways, when we came to the field.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, my boys, there are dangerous complaints gone abroad against us; your fat Monks, and your lean Usurers, have taken exception at us For∣resters, and called us Free-booters—for which reason the King's pardon would be a good thing.</P>

<P>There is no danger; I have a friend there in a corner—Besides I know how to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my part; I will sing them jovial songs, tell them merry tales, and for∣give them all their sins, and I warrant I shall be a fa∣vourite in the family.</P>

<P>Nay, I don't fear thee, for thou art thorough∣ly instructed in the art and mystery of eating, drinking, and wenching, and that is the trade of a Friar.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Adam.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, I intend to go armed, <Q REND="margQuotes">and sling my bugle horn across my shoulder: do you watch round the skirts of the forest, and in case of any ac∣cident, I will wind the signal of good or ill success.</Q>—But let Leonard know the scheme as soon as you see him—he has a true heart, and will never forsake a good cause.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Revenge for a dear brother, basely slain, and reparation for a rude denial to an honourable proposi∣tion.—Briefly, I seek to win Edwitha, whom I vehe∣mently love, and punish Earl Egbert, whom I as dead∣ly hate.</P>

<P>Insolent Lord, I <HI>have</HI> said—thy proclaimed death of Alric.</P>

<P>Then is thy enmity misplaced—For not Earl Egbert, <STAGE>[lifts up his beaver]</STAGE> but I, Leoline, the Bri∣ton, slew thy brother.</P>

<P>In defence of that most chaste and beauteous Lady, I slew him; and again, in her defence, here do I stand in thy defiance, proud Dane; nay further do proclaim my Love for her with a tongue as loud as thine, but with a heart, I hope, less arrogant.—Now, if thou hast a soul worthy of such most matchless Ex∣cellence, let it rouse up every latent faculty, and fill thee with the divine furor of courageous Love.—Behold—look upon that lovely, that inestimable Prize, and be thou equal to a contention so exalted—Come—</P>

<P>Beauteous Edwitha, why I have appeared in a shape and character so ambiguous shall be the questi∣on, I hope, of many a happy hour.—It was indeed to gain your true affection—not as a Prince, who could confer, but as a Suppliant who besought your favour,—and such let me ever continue.</P>

<P>I could not come, my Lord, proud of my birth, and heralding, my titles, to claim a jewel so inestima∣ble, so much above the price of Kings, or Kingdoms.—No, Edwitha, though I love you to distraction, could I not first have won your heart, I never would have asked your hand.—<Q REND="margQuotes">My fixed passion, would have descended with me to the grave, but never should have troubled your repose.</Q></P>

<P>You tell us, my Lord, how much you are in love, but not how you became so.</P>

<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fame of Edwitha's beauties, her virtues, and the rare endowments of her mind, of these I had often heard. At last a Knight, who had met courteous entertainment, from my Lord her father here, described her wit, her gentleness, and charms, with such enraptured words, I could no longer re∣sist the secret wish to behold her, which from the moment when first I heard her praise, I had ever cherished.—That my love has been successful, is the happiness and glory of my life.</P>
