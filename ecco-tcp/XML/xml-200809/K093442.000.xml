<L>Celestial Beam! that brightens all above,</L>
<L>And fills with Demi-gods the Court of <HI>Jove</HI>:</L>
<L>Immortal MERIT! to my Aid descend!</L>
<L>Let Fancy fire, let Truth my Verse attend!</L>
<L>On Truth's eternal Base, thy Trophies raise,</L>
<L>Let Honesty to Heaven exalt thy Praise;</L>
<L>Let Art, let Genius, on that Ground conspire;</L>
<L>Let gen'rous Pride the panting Bosom fire,</L>
<L>To mount to Glory, on the Heights of Fame,</L>
<L>And build, on Truth, an everlasting Name.</L>

<L>Who trace the winding Tracts where Comets roll,</L>
<L>Who poize the Planets, and who grasp the Pole;</L>
<L>On NEWTON's Wings the Solar Walk survey,</L>

<L>On Wisdom's Steps, to Wisdom's Fountain soar,</L>

<L>To Names like these the World must Homage pay,</L>
<L>And Malice at their Feet her Vipers lay;</L>
