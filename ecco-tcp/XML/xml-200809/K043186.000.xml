<SP>
<L>THE title giv'n to our play</L>
<L>Is whimsical and odd, you'll say,</L>
<L>Because announc'd—The Wedding Day.</L>
<L>But know you not, my friends above,</L>
<STAGE>To the Galleries.</STAGE>
<L>'Tis what you one and all approve?</L>
<L>For when you squeeze each other's hand,</L>
<L>And find your wishes at a stand,</L>
<L>You press the Wedding Day, and cry,</L>
<L>Come, let's to church, my dear, and try</L>
<L>Who loves the truest—you or I.</L>
<L>Then as 'tis known a day of bliss,</L>
<L>Pray let it not prove <HI>here</HI> amiss;</L>
<L>For tho' elop'd—I know not how—</L>
<L>From <HI>Next door Neighbours</HI>—just below—</L>
<L>And hither come to make her bow—</L>
<L>Like other trips of gallant love,</L>
<L>Constant <HI>to both</HI> you'll find her prove.</L>
<L>Or who is right, or who is wrong,</L>
<L>With me to state does not belong;</L>
<L>But only to proclaim the banns,</L>
<L>And leave to you th' applauding hands;</L>
<L>Nor hope to find one critic here</L>
<L>Will dare forbid our Wedding Cheer;</L>
<L>But give their usual friendly boon,</L>
<L>And let's enjoy <HI>the honey-moon.</HI></L>
<L>To laugh is all our author means</L>
<L>In what she pourtrays in her scenes,</L>
<L>And aims, in all she dares to write,</L>
<L>To make her Wedding Day—a merry night.</L>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>AT home? To be sure I am—how could you make any doubts about it?
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Ser∣vant.]</STAGE>
Deny me to my old acquaintance, and favourite friend, Tom Contest!</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</STAGE>
<P>My dear Contest, I congratulate us both that your travels are completed, and that you are come to taste, for the remainder of your life, the joys of your own country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether to taste joy or sorrow I am yet in doubt; for I am uncertain in what manner I shall be received by my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not you seen him yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No:—nor dare I till I know in what humour he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a good one, you may depend upon it; for he is very lately married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my utter concern! I heard some time ago indeed, that it was his design to marry again; but as he has never condescended to make me acquainted with it himself, I know nothing far∣ther respecting the marriage than what public report has thrown in my way. Pray can you tell me who my new mother is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am told she is very young, extremely lively, and prodigiously beautiful. I am told too that she has been confined in the country, dressed, and treated like a child, till her present age of eighteen, in order to preserve the appearance of youth in her mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who is her mother? Of what family is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I don't know—and I suppose your fa∣ther did not consider of what family she was, but merely what family she was likely to bring him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have no doubt but he married on pur∣pose
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
to disinherit me, for having written to him, "that I had fixed my affections upon a widow of small fortune, but one who was so perfectly to my wishes, that even his commands could not force me to forsake her."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were you in earnest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I was then: but at present I am more humble. I have implored his pardon for those hasty expressions, and now only presume by sup∣plication to obtain his approbation of my choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is she a foreigner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; an English woman.—We met at Flo∣rence—parted at Venice—and she arrived in London just four days before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when will you introduce me to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you as much a man of gallantry as ever? If you are, you shall first promise me not to make love to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, my dear friend, you know I never make a promise when I think there is the least probability of my breaking it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then positively you shall not see my choice
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
till I am secure of her. But I can tell you what I'll do—I'll introduce you to my young mother-in-law, if you like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, that will do quite as well—nay, I don't know if it won't do better. Come, let us go directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! not till I have obtained my father's leave:—for, after offending him so highly as not to hear from him these six months, I thought it necessary to send a letter to him as soon as I arrived this morning, to beg his permission to wait upon him. And here, I suppose, is his answer.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter a</HI> SERVANT, <HI>and gives a letter to Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant enquired for you, Sir, and left this.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST <HI>breaks open the letter hastily, and reads.</HI>]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>An invitation to go to his house immediately.
<STAGE>He reads the remainder of the letter, and then expressing surprise</STAGE>
—Why my father tells me he was only married this very morning! I heard he was married a week ago!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so did I—and so did half the town. His marriage has even been in the newspapers these three days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, these things are always announced before they take place: and I most sincerely wish it had been delayed still longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not—for I long to have a kiss of the bride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! my Lord: as it is the wedding day, I cannot think of taking you now: it may be improper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, not at all. A wedding day is a public day; and Sir Adam knows upon what familiar terms you and I are. Indeed, my dear friend, my going will be considered but as neigh∣bourly. I can take no denial—I must go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it must be so, come then.
<STAGE>Going, stops.</STAGE>
Notwithstanding the cause I have for rejoicing at this kind invitation from my father, still I feel embarrassed at the thoughts of appearing before him, in the presence of his young wife; for I have no doubt but she'll take a dislike to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> RAKELAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if she should, I have no doubt but she'll take a liking to <HI>me.</HI> So come away, and be in spirits.

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing is so provoking as to be in a situation where one is expected to be merry—it is like being asked in company "to tell a good story, and to be entertaining;" and then you are sure to be duller than ever you were in your life. Now, notwithstanding this is my wedding day, I am in such a blessed humour that I should like to make every person's life in this house a burthen to them. But I won't
<STAGE>Struggling with himself</STAGE>
—No, I won't.—What a continual com∣bat is mine! To feel a perpetual tendency to every vice, and to possess no one laudable qua∣lity, but that of a determination to overcome all my temptations. I am strongly impelled to violent anger, and yet I have the resolution to be a calm, peaceable man—I am inclined to suspicion, yet I conquer it, and <HI>will</HI> place con∣fidence in others—I am disposed to malice, yet I constantly get the better of it—I am addicted to love, yet I—No, hold!—there I must stop—that is a failing which always did get the better of <HI>me.</HI> Behold an instance of it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lady</HI> CONTEST <HI>slowly and pensively, drest like a Bride.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
Now I will be in a good humour, in spite of all my doubts and fears.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you send for me, Sir Adam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear; your guardian is just stept home, to bring his wife to dine with us; and I wished to have a few minutes conversation with you. Sit down.
<STAGE>They sit.</STAGE>
I observed, Lady Contest (and it gave me uneasiness), that at church this morning, while the ceremony was performing, you looked very pale. You have not yet wholly regained your colour: and in∣stead of your usual cheerful countenance and air, I perceive a pensive, dejected—Come, look cheerful.
<STAGE>Very sharply</STAGE>
—Why don't you look cheerful?
<STAGE>Checking himself, and softening his voice</STAGE>
—Consider, every one should be happy upon their wedding day, for it is a day that seldom comes above once in a person's life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But with <HI>you,</HI> Sir Adam, it has come twice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true—it has—and my <HI>first</HI> was a day indeed! I shall never forget it! My wife was as young as you are now—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you were younger than you are now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Starts—then aside</STAGE>
—No, I won't be angry.
<STAGE>To her</STAGE>
—She was beautiful too—nay more, she was good; she possessed every quality.—But this is not a proper topic on the present occasion; and so, my dear, let us change the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir Adam, is it true that your son is come to town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; and I expect him here every moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you invited no other company all day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your guardian and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Ploughman, you know, will be here; and what other company would you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the country we had always fiddles and dancing at every wedding; and I declare I have been merrier at other people's weddings, than I think I am likely to be at my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you loved me, Lady Contest, you would be merry in my company alone. <HI>Do</HI> you love me? My first wife loved me dearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so do I love you dearly—just the same as I would love my father, if he were alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
Now could I lay her at my feet for that sentence. But I won't—I won't.
<STAGE>Struggling with himself</STAGE>
Answer me this—would you change husbands with any one of your acquaint∣ance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>What signifies now my answering such a ques∣tion as that, when I am sure not one of my ac∣quaintance would change with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>What makes you think so?
<STAGE>Violently</STAGE>
—
<STAGE>Softening</STAGE>
—Your equipage will be by far the most splendid of any lady's you will visit. I have made good my promise in respect to your jewels too; and I hope you like them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like them! to be sure!—Oh my dear Sir Adam, they even make me like you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very poor proof of your love, if you can give me no other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I'll give you fifty others.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Aside, and struggling with his passion.</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not all your money, I hope, Sir Adam; for my guardian told me you had a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you marry me for that? What makes you blush? Come, confess to me—for there was always a sincerity in your nature which charmed me beyond your beauty. It was that sincerity, and that alone, which captivated me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am surprised you did not marry your chaplain's widow, good old Mrs. Brown!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
<P>And egad I almost wish I had mar∣ried her. By what I have now said, Lady Contest, I meant to let you know, that in comparison

with virtues, I have no esteem for a youthful or a beautiful face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear! how you and I differ! for I here declare, I do love a beautiful youthful face, bet∣ter than I love any thing in the whole world.</P>

I'll be in a good humour pre∣sently—but not just yet.—Yes—I <HI>will</HI> get the better of it.—I won't use her ill—I have sworn at the altar, not to use her ill, and I will keep my vow.

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> CONTEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a line, nor a word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ADAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is wonderful that she should not send us a proper address! There is no doubt but that every letter we have sent to her since she has been abroad, has miscarried. However, it will be great joy and pride to her, when she hears of your marriage.</P>

<P>Yes—for she always said I was not born to make my fortune.</P>

<P>Don't, don't—I can't bear to hear it repeated. I loved her too sincerely.

<P>MY dear Lady Autumn, Mr. Contest is not of a proper age for a lover, much less for a husband of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Hamford, I believe, old as you pretend to think me now, you thought me young but a few weeks ago at Venice; when, on your first landing there, you imposed upon me your ro∣mantic tale, and prevailed with me to bring you to England.</P>

<P>Hold, Madam, do not conclude too hastily, that, because I have for a few days since my arrival in my native country, deferred my pro∣mise of revealing to you my real name and my connections here, that I am for this reason an impostor.</P>

<P>No; upon recollection, you certainly <HI>have</HI> been living on a savage island for these ten or twelve years, which gives you all these Hottentot ideas in respect to the advanced age of women.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> MILLDEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt—But I cannot give you any parti∣culars of the marriage, nor tell you even the gen∣tleman's name—for I only passed her guardian by accident in his carriage, and I had not an op∣portunity to enquire, nor he to inform me far∣ther, than "that it was a most advantageous union for your daughter, for that her husband is a man of fortune and title."</P>
