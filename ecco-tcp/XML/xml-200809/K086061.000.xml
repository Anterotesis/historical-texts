<P>I. ON THE DEATH OF SAMUEL FOOTE, ESQ.</P>
<P>II. ON AGE.</P>
<P>BY THOMAS HOLCROFT, Of the Theatre Royal, Drury-Lane.</P>

<P>[Price One Shilling.]</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one who amuses himself with writing Works of Imagination, has a View to either Profit or Fame. Though the Author of the fol∣lowing Trifles does not pretend to be above such Mo∣tives, yet he hopes his Anxiety is not powerful enough to render him unhappy one Moment, should he be en∣tirely disappointed. He is sensible how much Success depends upon Circumstances. A Poem must be read before it can be admired; nay more, it must be read with some Share of that Temper and Spirit in which it was written, or it will appear languid. A good Character, or a bad one, given by those Gentlemen
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>who take upon themselves the Office of Public Cen∣sors in literary Matters, will frequently, at least for a Time, determine its Fate. As he is entirely un∣known, he is not in any Dread of a partial Sentence. If these Poems are worthless, let them rest in that Oblivion which is the utmost Happiness Unworthiness can know: if the contrary happens to be the Case, he has no doubt but their Merits will be seen and acknowledged by every one whom Heaven has blest with Taste and Judgment sufficient to form the true Critic.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not any Thing, I believe, which calls forth the melancholy and sympathetic Passions more forcibly than a Sight of those Men who have once been great or famous, and have outlived their For∣tune or Faculties. Who can forbear sighing when he beholds a BELISARIUS? Whose Heart is not wrung when he views a SWIFT in his Dotage?—Reflections of this Kind gave Birth to the following Stanzas. They were written upon an old Man in a Coun∣try-Village, whose Strength, Activity, and rustic Ac∣complishments, were once the frequent Admiration of his Fellow-Swains; and when Age had deprived
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>him of them, and rendered him feeble and decrepid, the Remembrance of his past Exploits was often the Subject of their Exclamations, and the honest Motive of their Pity and Condolence, as well as the frequent Topic of his own Lamentation. The Effect that this Remembrance had upon his Mind cannot, perhaps, be conveyed more feelingly than by informing the Reader that the Sentence which I have chosen for a Motto was common in his Mouth, and generally attended with a Sigh.</P>
