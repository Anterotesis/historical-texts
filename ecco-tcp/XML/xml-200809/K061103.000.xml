<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE REV. MR. NARES.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. FARREN.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>OUR Author, who accuses great and small,</L>
<L>And says so boldly, there are faults in all;</L>
<L>Sends me with dismal voice, and lengthen'd phiz,</L>
<L>Humbly to own one dreadful fault of his:</L>
<L>A fault, in modern Authors not uncommon,</L>
<L>It is,—now don't be angry—He's—<HI>a woman.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can you forgive it? Nay, I'll tell you more,</L>
<L>One who has dar'd to venture here before;</L>
<L>Has seen your smiles, your frowns,—tremendous sight!</L>
<L>O, be not in a frowning mood to-night!</L>
<L>The Play, perhaps, has many things amiss:</L>
<L>Well, let us then reduce the point to this,</L>
<L>Let only those that have no failings, hiss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>The Rights of Women,</HI> says a female pen,</L>
<L>Are, to do every thing as well as Men.</L>
<L>To think, to argue, to decide, to write,</L>
<L>To talk, undoubtedly—perhaps, to fight.</L>
<L>[For Females march to war, like brave Commanders,</L>
<L>Not in old Authors only—but in Flanders.]</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I grant this matter may be strain'd too far,</L>
<L>And Maid 'gainst Man is most uncivil war:</L>
<L>I Grant, as all my City friends will say,</L>
<L>That Men should rule, and Women should obey:</L>
<L>That nothing binds the marriage contract faster,</L>
<L>Than our—a "Zounds, Madam, I'm your Lord and Master."</L>
<L>I grant their nature, and their frailty such,</L>
<L>Women may make too free—and know too much.</L>
<L>But since the Sex at length has been inclin'd</L>
<L>To cultivate that useful part—the mind;—</L>
<L>Since they have learnt to read, to write, to spell;—</L>
<L>Since some of them have wit,—and use it well;—</L>
<L>Let us not force them back with brow severe,</L>
<L>Within the pale of ignorance and fear,</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>Confin'd entirely to domestic arts,</L>
<L>Producing only children, pies, and tarts.</L>
<L>The fav'rite fable of the tuneful Nine,</L>
<L>Implies that female genius <HI>is divine.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, drive not, Critics, with tyrannic rage,</L>
<L>A supplicating Fair-one from the Stage;</L>
<L>The Comic Muse perhaps is growing old,</L>
<L>Her lovers, you well know, are few and cold.</L>
<L>'Tis time then freely to enlarge the plan,</L>
<L>And let all those write Comedies—that can.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> PLACID <HI>and Mr.</HI> SOLUS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU are to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say the same by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet your singularity pleases me; for you are the first elderly bachelor I ever knew, who did not hug himself in the reflection, that he was not in the trammels of wedlock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I am only the first elderly bachelor who has truth and courage enough to confess his dissa∣tisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you really wish you were married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do. I wish still more, that I had been married thirty years ago. Oh! I wish a wife and half-a-score children would now start up around me, and bring along with them all that affection, which we should have had for each other by being ear∣lier acquainted. But as it is, in my present state, there is not a person in the world I care a straw for; and the world is pretty even with me, for I don't believe there is a creature in it who cares a straw for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! You have in your time been a man of gallantry; and, consequently, must have made many attachments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, such as men of gallantry usually make. I have been attached to women who have purloined my fortune, and to men who have partaken of the theft: I have been in as much fear of my mistress as you are of your wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and without having one of those tender, delicate ties of a husband, an excuse for my ap∣prehension.—I have maintained children—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you complain for the want of a family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not say I ever had any children; I said I had <HI>maintained</HI> them; but I never believed they were mine; for I could have no dependence upon the principles of their mother—and never did I
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
take one of those tender infants in my arms, that the forehead of my Valet, the squint-eye of my Apothecary, or the double-chin of my Chaplain, did not stare me in the face, and damp all the fine feelings of the parent, which I had just call∣ed up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But those are accidents which may occur in the marriage state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that case, a man is pitied—in mine, he is only laughed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to heaven I could exchange the pity which my friends bestow on me, for the merriment which your ill fate excites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You want but courage to be envied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does any one doubt my courage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. If a Prince were to offend you, you would challenge him, I have no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my wife offend me, I am obliged to make an apology.—Was not that her voice? I hope she has not overheard our conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she have, she'll be in an ill humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>That she will be, whether she have heard it or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, good-day. I don't like to be driven from my fixed plan of wedlock; and, therefore, I won't be a spectator of your mutual discontent.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Going.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But before you go, Mr. Solus, permit me to remind you of a certain concern, that, I think, would afford you much more delight, than all you can, at this time of life, propose to yourself in marriage. Make happy by your beneficence, a near relation whom the truest affection has drawn into that state, but who is denied the blessing of competency to make the state supportable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean my nephew, Irwin? But do not you acknowledge he has a wife and children? Did not he marry the woman he loved, and has he not, at this moment, a large family, by whom he is beloved? And is he not, therefore, with all his poverty, much happier than I? He has often told me, when I have reproached him with his indiscreet marriage, "that in his wife he possessed kingdoms!" Do you suppose I will give any part of my fortune to a man who enjoys such exten∣sive domains? No:—let him preserve his terri∣tories, and I will keep my little estate for my own use. <STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> SPINSTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cousin, cousin Harmony, I will not forgive you for thus continually speaking in the behalf of every servant whom you find me offended with. Your philanthropy becomes insupportable; and, instead of being a virtue, degenerates into a vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, do not upbraid me for a constitu∣tional fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> SPINSTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; you had it from your infancy. I have heard your mother say you were always foolishly tender-hearted, and never shewed one of those discriminating passions of envy, hatred, or revenge, to which all her other children were liable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: since I can remember, I have felt the most unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures. I even protest to you, dear Madam, that, as I walk along the streets of this large metropolis, so warm is my heart towards every person who passes me, that I long to say, "How do you do?" and
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
"I am glad to see you," to them all. Some men, I should like even to stop and shake hands with;— and some women, I should like even to stop and kiss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> SPINSTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you be so ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, 'tis truth: and I sincerely lament that hu∣man beings should be such strangers to one another as we are. We live in the same street, without knowing one another's necessities; and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church, at cof∣fee-houses, play-houses, and all public places, without ever speaking a single word, or nodding "Good bye!" though 'tis a hundred chances to ten we never see one another again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> SPINSTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, kinsman, all this pretended philanthropy renders you ridiculous. There is not a fraud, a theft, or hardly any vice com∣mitted, that you do not take the criminal's part, shake your head, and cry, "Provisions are so scarce!" And no longer ago than last Lord-mayor's-day, when you were told that Mr. Alder∣man Ravenous was ill with an indigestion, you en∣deavoured to soften the matter, by exclaiming, "Provisions are so scarce!"—But, above all, I condemn that false humanity, which induces you to say many things in conversation which deserve to stigmatize you with the character of deceit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a weakness I confess. But though my honour sometimes reproaches me with it as a fault, my conscience never does: for it is by this very failing that I have frequently made the bitterest
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
enemies friends—Just by saying a few harmless sentences, which, though a species of falsehood and deceit, yet, being soothing and acceptable to the person offended, I have immediately inspired him with lenity and forgiveness; and then, by only re∣peating the self-same sentences to his opponent, I have known hearts cold and closed to each other, warmed and expanded, as every human creature's ought to be.</P>

<P>Why, to tell you the truth, your relation, Miss Spinster, is no great favourite of mine; and I don't like to dine with you, because I don't like her company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, to me, surprising!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, old bachelors and old maids never agree: we are too much alike in our habits: we know our own hearts so well, we are apt to disco∣ver every foible we would wish to forget, in the symptoms displayed by the other. Miss Spinster is peevish, fretful and tiresome, and I am always in a fidget when I am in her company.</P>

<P>I am very much obliged to her, and I certainly <HI>am</HI> mistaken about her temper—Some people, if they look ever so cross, are good-natured in the main; and I dare say she is so. Besides, she never has had a husband to sooth and soften her dispo∣sition; and there should be some allowance made for that.</P>

<P>Oh no, I cannot be guilty of such ill manners, though I talked of it. Besides, poor Mr. Solus does not come so often, and it would be wrong not to shew him all the civility we can. For my part, I have no dislike to the man; and, if taking a bit of dinner with us now and then can oblige either you or him, I should be to blame to make any ob∣jection. Come, let us go into the drawing-room to receive him.</P>

<P>Yes. For I could bear my misfortunes, my

wretched poverty with patience, in a land where our sorrows were shared by those about us; but here, in London, where plenty and ease smile upon every face; where, by birth you claim distinc∣tion, and I by services:—here to be in want,—to be obliged to take another name in shame of our own,—to tremble at the voice of every stranger, for fear he should be a creditor,—to meet each old ac∣quaintance with an averted eye, because we would not feel the pang of being shunned.—To have no reward for all this, even in a comfortable home; but there, to see our children looking up to me for that support I have not in my power to give—Can I,—can I love them and you, and not be mi∣serable?</P>

<P>I met my uncle this morning, and was mean enough to repeat my request to him;—he burst into a fit of laughter, and told me my distresses were the result of my ambition, in marrying the daughter of a nobleman, who himself was too am∣bitious ever to pardon us.</P>

<P>As well as he did at the time I used to watch him from his house, to steal to you.—But I am sorry to acquaint you, that, to guard himself against all re∣turning love for you, he has, I am informed, adopted a young lad, on whom he bestows every mark of that paternal affection, of which you lament the loss.</P>

<P>May the young man deserve his tenderness bet∣ter than I have done—May he never disobey him —May <HI>he</HI> be a comfort, and cherish his benefac∣tor's declining years—And when his youthful pas∣sions teach him to love, may they not, like mine, teach him disobedience!</P>

<P>My dear Mr. Solus, I am glad to see you. I have been dining by myself, and now come into this public room to meet with some good company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir Robert, you are now reduced to the same necessity which I frequently am—I frequently am obliged to dine at taverns and coffee-houses, for want of company at home.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I protest I am never happier than in a house like this, where a man may meet his friend without the inconvenience of form, either as a host or a visitor.</P>

<P>Sir Robert, give me leave to introduce to you Mr. Placid: he has been many years abroad; but I believe he now means to remain in his own country for the rest of his life. This, Mr. Placid, is Sir Robert Ramble.</P>

<P>Sir, I shall be happy in your acquaintance; and I assure you, if you will do me the honour to meet me now and then at this house, you will find every thing very pleasant. I verily believe, that since I lost my wife, which is now about five months ago, I verily believe I have dined here three days out of the seven.</P>
</SP>

<P>Have you lost your wife, Sir? And so lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>with great indifference.</STAGE>
<P>Yes, Sir; about five months ago—Is it not, Mr. Solus? You keep account of such things better than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! ask me no questions about your wife, Sir Robert; if she had been mine, I would have had her to this moment.</P>

<P>What, wrested her from the gripe of death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; only from the gripe of the Scotch lawyers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>More shame for you. Shame! to wish to be divorced from a virtuous wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was that the case? Divorced from a virtuous wife! I never heard of such a circumstance be∣fore. Pray, Sir Robert <STAGE>very anxiously</STAGE>, will you indulge me, by letting me know in what manner you were able to bring about so great an event?</P>

<P>It may appear strange to you, Sir; but my wife and I did not live happy together.</P>

<P>Not at all strange, Sir; I can conceive—I can conceive very well.</P>

<P>Yes; he can conceive that part to a nicety.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then her character could not be unim∣peached.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it was, Sir. You must know, we were married in Scotland, and by the laws there, a wife can divorce her <HI>husband</HI> for breach of fidelity; and so, though my wife's character was unimpeached, mine was not, and she divorced me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this the law in Scotland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. Blessed, blessed country! that will bind young people together before the years of dis∣cretion—and, as soon as they have discretion to re∣pent, will unbind them again!</P>

<P>I wish I had been married in Scotland.</P>

<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon; but every body knows that you have played very deep lately, and have been a great loser, and every body knows—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, every body does not know it, for I contradict the report wherever I go. A man of fashion does not like to be reckoned poor, no more than he likes to be reckoned unhappy. We none of us endeavour to <HI>be</HI> happy, Sir, but merely to be <HI>thought</HI> so; and for my part, I had rather be in a state of misery, and envied for my supposed hap∣piness, than in a state of happiness, and pitied for my supposed misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But consider, these misfortunes which I have just hinted at, are not of any serious nature, only such as a few years oeconomy—</P>

<P>I tell you, Sir, she is hideous. And then she was grown so insufferably peevish.</P>

<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw her out of temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Solus, it is very uncivil of you to praise her before my face. Lady Ramble, at the time I parted with her, had every possible fault both of mind and person, and so I made love to other women in her presence; told her bluntly that I was tired of her; that <Q>I was very sorry to make her uneasy, but that I could not love her any longer.</Q>—And was not that frank and open?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that I had but such a wife as she was!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own I loved her myself when she was young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you call her old?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In years I am certainly older than she; but the difference of sex makes her a great deal older than I am. For instance, Mr. Solus, you have often lamented not being married in your youth; but if you had, what would you have now done with an old wife, a woman of your own age?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loved and cherished her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, in spite of her loss of beauty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>When she had lost her beauty; most likely I should have lost my eye-sight, and have been blind to the wane of her charms.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true: Where did I leave off? Oh! at my ill usage of my Lady Ramble. Yes, I did use her very ill, and yet she loved me. Many a time, when she has said to me, "Sir Robert, I detest your principles, your manners, and even your person," often, at that very instant, I have seen a little sparkle of a wish peep out of the corner of one eye, that has called to me, "Oh! Sir Robert, how I long to make it up with you!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE><HI>to Mr.</HI> Placid.</STAGE>
<P>Do not you wish that your wife had such a little sparkle at the corner of one of her eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<STAGE><HI>to Mr.</HI> Placid.</STAGE>
<P>Sir, do you wish to be divorced?</P>

<P>I have no such prospect. Mrs. Placid is faith∣ful, and I was married in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you have an unconquerable desire to part, a separate maintenance will answer nearly the same end—for if your Lady and you will only lay down the plan of separation, and agree—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But, unfortunately, we never do agree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, Sir; but I find some of my countrymen changed. I fancy them less warm, less friendly than they were; and it is that which, perhaps, has this effect upon me.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>am</HI> in affluence, I am, I am; but not in so much, perhaps, as my hasty, inconsiderate account may have given you reason to believe. I forgot to mention several heavy incumbrances, which you will perceive are great drawbacks on my for∣tune.—As my wife sued for the divorce, I have her fortune to return; I have also two sisters to portion off—a circumstance I totally forgot. But, my good friend, though I am not in circumstances to do what you require, I will do something that shall be better. I'll wait upon your father-in-law, (Lord Norland) and entreat him to forgive his daughter: and I am sure he will if I ask him.</P>

<P>And so it is, now I recollect: for he is no other than the guardian of my late wife, and a request from me, will be received worse than from any other person. — However, Mr. Irwin, depend upon it, that whenever I have an opportunity of serving you, I will. And whenever you shall do me the favour to call upon me, I shall be heartily glad to see you. If I am not at home, you can leave your card, which, you know, is all the same, and depend upon it, I shall be extremely glad to see you or that, at any time. <STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>

makes his fellow-savage welcome; divides with him his homely fare; gives him the best apart∣ment his hut affords, and tries to hush those griefs that are confided in his bosom—While in this ci∣vilized city, among my own countrymen, even among my brother officers in the army, and many of my nearest relations, so very civilized they are, I could not take the liberty to enter under one roof, without a ceremonious invitation, and that they will not give me. I may leave my card at their door, but as for me, or any one of mine, they would not give us a dinner; unless, indeed, it was in such a style, that we might behold with admiration their grandeur, and return still more depressed, to our own poverty.—Can I bear this treatment longer? No, not even for you, my Eleanor. And this <STAGE>takes out a pistol</STAGE> shall now be the only friend to whom I will apply—And yet I want the courage to be a villain.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, if you should see him two or three days hence, when I am set out on a journey I am going, if you will then say a kind word to him for my wife and children, I'll thank you.</P>

<P>I TELL you, Mr. Harmony, that if an indif∣ferent person, one on whom I had never bestowed a favour in my life, were to offend me, it is in my nature never to forgive.

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>The weakest argument you can use. As my child, was not she most bound to obey me? As my child, ought she not to have sacrificed her own happiness to mine?

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have concealed it from all the world; I wished it even unknown to myself. And let me tell you, Sir, (as not by my design, but through my inadvertency, you are become ac∣quainted with this secret) that, if ever you breathe it to a single creature, the boy shall answer for it; for, were he known to be her's, though he were dearer to me than ever <HI>she</HI> was, I would turn him from my house, and cast him from my heart, as I have done her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you;—and in compassion to the child, give you my <HI>solemn promise</HI> never to reveal who he is. I have heard that those unfortunate parents left an infant behind when they went abroad, and that they now lament him as lost. Will you satis∣fy my curiosity, in what manner you sought and found him out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you suppose I searched for him? No;—he was forced upon me. A woman followed me, about eight years ago, in the fields adjoining to
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
my country seat, with a half-starved boy in her hand, and asked my charity for my grand-child: the impression of the word, made me turn round involuntarily; and casting my eyes upon him, I was rejoiced, not to find a feature of his mother's in all his face; and I began to feel something like pity for him. In short, he caught such fast hold by one of my fingers, that I asked him carelessly "if he would go home and live with me?" On which, he answered me so willingly "Yes," I took him at his word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did never your regard for him, plead in his mother's behalf?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am intimate with Sir Robert, my Lord; and though I acknowledge that both you and his lady have cause for complaint, yet Sir Robert has still many virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one. He is the most vile, the most detest∣able of characters. He not only contradicted my will in the whole of his conduct, but he seldom met me that he did not give me some personal affront.</P>
</SP>

<P>It is, however, generally held better to be unci∣vil in a person's presence, than in his absence.</P>

<P>I wish he had sometimes done me the honour to have spoken politely to my face.</P>

<P>That is not Sir Robert's way;—he is no flat∣terer. But then, no sooner has your back been turned, than I have heard him lavish in your praise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own, Mr. Harmony, that I never looked upon Sir Robert as incorrigible. I could always discern a ray of understanding, and a beam of vir∣tue through all his foibles; nor would I have urged the divorce, but that I found his wife's sen∣sibility could not bear his neglect; and even now, notwithstanding her endeavour to conceal it, she pines in secret, and laments her hard fortune. All my hopes of restoring her health rest on one pros∣pect—that of finding a man worthy my recom∣mendation for her second husband, and, by creat∣ing a second passion, expel the first.—Mr. Har∣mony, you and I have been long acquainted—I have known your disposition from your infancy— Now, if such a man as you were to offer—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You flatter me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say I have any particular desire; but if it will oblige either you or her,—for my part, I think the short time we live in this world, we should do all we can to oblige each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should rejoice at such an union myself, and I

think I can answer for her.—You permit me then to make overtures to her in your name?</P>
</SP>

<P>This is rather a serious piece of business— However, I never did make a difficulty when I wished to oblige a friend.—But there is one pro∣viso, my Lord; I must first mention it to Sir Robert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he and I have always been very inti∣mate friends; and to marry his wife, without even telling him of it, will appear very uncivil!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean then to ask his consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not absolutely his consent; but I will insinuate the subject to him, and obtain his approbation in a manner suitable to my own satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will oblige me then if you will see him as early as possible; for it is reported he is going abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will go to him immediately;—and, my Lord, I will do all in my power to oblige you, Sir Ro∣bert and the Lady; <STAGE>aside</STAGE>—but as to obliging my∣self, that was never one of my considerations.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WOOBURN.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, my Lord. Tears from our sex are not always the result of grief; they are fre∣quently no more than little sympathetic tributes which we pay to our fellow-beings, while the mind and the heart are steeled against the weakness which our eyes indicate.</P>

<P>I must first inform you, that Lord Norland has just drawn from me a promise, that I will once more enter into the marriage-state; and without knowing to whom he intends to give me, I will keep my promise—But it is in vain to say, that, though I mean all duty and fidelity to my second husband, I shall not experience moments when my thoughts—will wander on my first.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I will most undoubtedly take this bond to my friend; but will you give me leave to sug∣gest to you, that the person on whom you bestow your hand, may be a little surprised to find, that while he is in possession of you, Sir Robert is in the possession of your fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WOOBURN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not imagine, Sir, that I shall marry any man, without first declaring what I have done—I only wish at present it should be concealed from Lord Norland—When this paper is given, as I have required, it cannot be recalled; and when that is past, I shall divulge my conduct to whom I please; and first of all, to him, who shall offer me his addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he is a man of my feelings, his ad∣dresses will be doubly importunate for this proof of liberality to your former husband. — But are you sure, that in the return of this bond, there is no secret affection, no latent spark of love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> WOOBURN.</SPEAKER>
<P>None. I know my heart; and if there was, I could not ask you, Mr. Harmony (nor any one like you), to be the messenger of an imprudent passion. Sir Robert's vanity, I know, may cause him to judge otherwise; but undeceive him; let him know this is a sacrifice to the golden princi∣ples of duty, and not an offering to the tinselled shrine of love.

<P>What makes you think so?</P>

<P>And where is the woman who marries the man she would choose? You are reversing the order of society; men, only, have the right of choice in marriage.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Robert, what is the matter? Has any thing ruffled you? Why, I never saw you look more out of temper, even while you were married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that I had never married! never known what marriage was! for, even at this moment, I feel its torments in my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often heard of the torments of matri∣mony; but I conceive, that at the worst, they are nothing more than a kind of violent tickling, which will force the tears into your eyes, though at the same time you are bursting your sides with laughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have defined marriage too favourably; there is no laughter in the state: all is melancholy, all gloom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy for the spleen. I have known a Gentleman at a feast receive an affront, disguise his rage, step home, vent it all upon his wife, return to his com∣panions, and be as good company as if nothing had happened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But even the necessary expences of a wife should alarm you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can then retrench some of my own. Oh! my dear Sir, a married man has so many delightful privileges to what a bachelor has!—An old Lady will introduce her daughters to you in a dishabille —"It does not signify, my dears, it's a married man"—One Lady will suffer you to draw on her glove—"Never mind, it's a married man"— Another will permit you to pull on her slipper; a third will even take you into her bed-chamber —"Pshaw, it's <HI>nothing</HI> but a married man."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the weight of your fetters will overbalance all these joys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I cannot say, notwithstanding you are re∣lieved from the bond, that I see much joy or brightness here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not very well at present; I have the head∣ach; and, if ever a wife can be of comfort to her husband, it must be when he is indisposed. A wife, then, binds up your head, mixes your powders, bathes your temples, and hovers about, in a way that is most endearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't speak of it; I long to have one hover about me. But I will—I am determined I will, before I am a week older. Don't speak, don't at∣tempt to persuade me not. Your description has renewed my eagerness—I will be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without pretending not to know who you mean to make your wife, I tell you plainly, it is, Miss Wooburn, it is my late wife.—I know you
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
made overtures to my Lord Norland, and that he has given his consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You tell me a great piece of news—I'll go ask my Lord if it be true; and if he says it is, I shall be very glad to find it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is right, Sir; marry her, marry her;—I give you joy,—that's all.—Ha, ha, ha! I think I should know her temper.—But if you will venture to, marry her, I sincerely wish you happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if we are not, you know we can be di∣vorced.</P>

<P>Not always. Take my advice, and live as you are.</P>

<P>I begin to think he is—but he was not so when I first took him. No, no, if he had, he would not have been thus near me now;—but to turn him away because his countenance is a little changed, I think would not be right.</P>

<P>Did <HI>you</HI> ever see her, my Lord?</P>

<P>I thought you had orders never to enquire about your parents? Have you forgot those orders?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord; but when this gentleman said I was like my mother—it put me in mind of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not remember your mother, do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes I think I do. I think sometimes I remember her kissing me, when she and my father went on board of a ship; and so hard she pressed me—I think I feel it now.</P>
</SP>

<P>Perhaps she was the only Lady that ever saluted you?</P>

subject), what brought you here? You seem to have forgot your errand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I had, upon my word. Speaking of my mother, put it quite out of my head.—But, my Lord, I came to let you know, the robber who stopped you last night is taken.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it.</P>

<P>Ay, wretched man! I suppose with terror.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; it appeared a different passion from fear.</P>

<P>Perhaps, my Lord, it was <HI>your</HI> fear that made you think so.</P>

<P>No, Sir, I was not frightened.</P>

<P>Then why did you give him your money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was surprise caused me to do that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wondered what it was! You said it was not fear, and I was sure it could not be love.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How has he been taken?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>A person came to our steward, and informed against him;—and, Oh! my Lord, his poor wife told the officers who took him, they had met with misfortunes, which she feared had caused a fever in her husband's head; and, indeed, they found him too ill to be removed; and so, she hoped, she said, "that as a man, not in his perfect mind, you would be merciful to him."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be just.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is being merciful, is it not, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not always.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it had been.—It is not <HI>just</HI> to be un∣merciful, is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it must be <HI>just,</HI> to have mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You draw a false conclusion. Great as is the virtue of <HI>mercy, justice</HI> is greater still. <HI>Justice</HI> holds its place among those cardinal virtues which include all the lesser.—Come, Mr. Harmony, will you go home with me? And before I attend to this business, let me persuade you to forget there is such a person in the world as Sir Robert, and suffer me to introduce you to Miss Wooburn, as the man who—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg to be excused—Besides the consideration of Sir Robert, I have another reason why I cannot go with you. The melancholy tale which this young gentleman has been telling, has cast a gloom on my spirits which renders me unfit for the society of a Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I should not be surprised were you to go in search of this culprit and his family, and come to me to intreat me to forego the prosecution; but, before you ask me, I tell you it is in vain—I will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Lord Norland, I have lately been so unsuccess∣ful in my petitions to you, I shall never presume to interpose between your rigour and a weak sufferer more.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The good in all states, even in the very jaws of death, are objects of envy; it is the bad who are the only real sufferers: There, where no internal consolation cheers, who can refuse a little external comfort?—And let me tell you, my Lord, that amidst all your authority, your state, your gran∣deur, I often pity you. <STAGE>Speaking with unaffected compassion.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> ELEANOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I cannot send in. But tell him, Sir, I am the afflicted wife of a man, who for some weeks past has given many fatal proofs of a disordered mind. In one of those fits of phrensy, he held an instru∣ment of death, meant for his own destruction, to the breast of your Lord (who by accident that moment passed), and took from him, what he vainly hoped might preserve his own life, and relieve the wants of his family. But his paroxysm over, he shrunk from what he had done, and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken, into a servant's hands to be returned to its lawful owner. The man, admitted to this confidence, betrayed his trust, and instead of giving up what was so sacredly delivered to him, secreted it; and, to obtain the promised reward, came to this house, but to in∣form against the wretched offender; who now, only resting on your Lord's clemency, can escape the direful fate he has incurred.</P>

<P>This is my father's house! It is only through two rooms and one short passage, and there he is sitting in his study.

<P>I believe he has, Madam; but he has never told me so yet.</P>

<P>I know what your suit is, Madam, because I was with my Lord when Hammond brought in your message; and I was so sorry for you, I came out on purpose to see you—and, without speaking to my Lord, I could do you a great kindness—if I durst.</P>

<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I would not add to your grief for the world.—But then, pray do not speak of what I am going to say.—I heard my Lord's lawyer tell him just now, "that as he said he should not know the person again, who committed the offence about which you came, and as the man who informed against him was gone off, there could be no evidence that he did the action, but from a book, a parti∣cular pocket-book, of my Lord's, which he forgot to deliver to his servant with the notes and money to return, and which was found upon him at your house: and this, Lord Norland will affirm to be his."—Now, if I did not think I was doing wrong, this is the very book— <STAGE>Takes a pocket-book front his pocket</STAGE> I took it from my Lord's table;— but it would be doing wrong, or I am sure I wish you had it. <STAGE>Looking wishfully at her.</STAGE></P>

<P>Nay, I do not know whether you will envy me much when you see my spouse—I cannot say she was exactly my choice. However, she is my wife now; and that is a name so endearing, I think I love her better since the ceremony has been per∣formed.</P>

<P>And pray, when did it take place?</P>

<P>This moment. We are now returning from a friend's house, where we have been joined; and I felt myself so happy, I could not pass Sir Robert's door, without calling to tell him of my good for∣tune.—And, as I see your Lady here, Sir Robert, I guess you are just married too; and so I'll hand my wife out of the carriage, and introduce the two Brides to each other. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Solus.</STAGE></P>

<P>You see, my Lord, what construction Mr. Solus has put on this Lady's visit to me. And by Heaven, if you take her away, it will be said, that she came and offered herself, and that I reject her!</P>

<P>I agree with you, Mr. Solus, that this is a most excellent proof of a person's disposition; and in consideration, Sir Robert, that, throughout all our many disagreements, you have still preserved a re∣spect for my character in my absence, I do at last say to that Lady, she has my consent to trust you again.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARMONY,</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>Holding a letter in his hand.</STAGE>
<P>Amidst those bright prospects of joy which this company are contemplating, I come to announce an event that ought to cloud the splendour of the horizon.—A worthy, but an ill-fated man, whom
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
ye were all acquainted with, has just breathed his last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean the husband of my daughter?</P>

<P>Did Mr. Irwin possess all those titles you have given him, Gentlemen?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still more strange that he should die for want, and not apply to any of you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Die for want in London! Starve in the midst of plenty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but he seized that plenty, where law, where honour, where every social and religious tie forbad the trespass; and in punishment of the guilt, has become his own executioner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then my daughter is wretched, and her boy involved in his father's infamy.</P>
</SP>

<P>The fear of his ghost haunting me, will disturb the joys of my married life.</P>

<P>Mrs. Placid, Mrs. Placid, my complying with your injunctions in respect of Mr. Irwin, will make me miserable for ever.</P>

<P>I wish he had applied to me.</P>

<P>And as I refused him his request. I would give half my estate he had <HI>not</HI> applied to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a man who always spoke so well of you all behind your backs!—I dare say, that, in his dying moments, there was not one of you whom he did not praise for some virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOLUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no—when he was dying he would be more careful of what he said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> NORLAND.</SPEAKER>

great a shock, for me to be capable of any other impression at present.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARMONY</SPEAKER>
<STAGE><HI>Goes hastily to</HI> Solus, <HI>and leads him to</HI> Irwin; <HI>then turns to Mr. and Mrs.</HI> Placid.</STAGE>
<P>And now, that I see you all reconciled, I can say, there are not two enemies in the whole circle of my acquaintance, that I have not within these three days made friends.</P>
</SP>

<P>Very true, Harmony; for we should never have known half how well we all love one another, if you had not told us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARMONY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, my good friends, notwithstanding the merit you may attribute to me, I have one most tremendous fault; and it weighs so heavy on my conscience, I would confess what it is, but that you might hereafter call my veracity in question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Harmony, without a fault, you would not be a proper companion for any of us.</P>
</SP>
