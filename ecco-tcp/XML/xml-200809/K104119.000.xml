<HEAD>THE NUNNERY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>REtirement's Hour proclaims the tolling Bell,</L>
<L>Each sacred Virgin follows its Decree;</L>
<L>With meek Submission seeks her lonely Cell,</L>
<L>And leaves the Grate to Solitude and me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now shows the sinking Sun a fainter glare</L>
<L>And Silence thro' the Convent reigns confest,</L>
<L>Save where some pale-ey'd Novice (wrap'd in Pray'r)</L>
<L>Heaves a deep groan: and smites her guiltless breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>Save where in artless melancholy Strains</L>
<L>Some <HI>Eloisa</HI> whom soft Passion moves,</L>
<L>Absorpt in Sorrow to the Night complains;</L>
<L>For ever bar'd the <HI>Abelard</HI> she loves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within those ancient Walls by Moss o'erspread,</L>
<L>Where the relenting Sinner learns to weep;</L>
<L>Each in her narrow Bed till Mid-night laid,</L>
<L>The gentle Daughters of Devotion sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Stings of Conscience goad their easy Breast,</L>
<L>No unrepented Crimes their Slumbers fright,</L>
<L>No mournful Dreams invade their peaceful Rest,</L>
<L>Nor shrouded Spectres stalk afore their Sight!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' endearing Scenes of Life They all forego</L>
<L>Ev'n Hymen's Torch for Them must never blaze,</L>
<L>The Husband's fond Embrace They ne'er shall know,</L>
<L>Nor view their Image in their Children's' Face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Oft did they steal the flow'ry Robe of <HI>May</HI></L>
<L>To deck the Altar and the Shrines around:</L>
<L>How fervent did They chant the pious Lay,</L>
<L>While the deep Organ swell'd the sacred Sound?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not the gay Coquette with Jest profane,</L>
<L>Mock their veil'd Life and Destiny severe:</L>
<L>Nor worldly Beauty with a Sneer disdain</L>
<L>The humble Duties of the Cloyster'd Fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The glist'ning Eye: The half-seen Breast of Snow,</L>
<L>The coral Lip, the clear vermilion Bloom</L>
<L>Awaits alike th' inexorable Foe,</L>
<L>The Paths of Pleasure lead but to the Tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive, Ye Fair, whom <HI>Britain's</HI> Sons admire,</L>
<L>If This her meanest Bard incur your Blame,</L>
<L>While He devotes not to your Praise the Lyre,</L>
<L>But to the Convent dedicates his Theme.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>Can These partake the sprightly-moving Dance?</L>
<L>Or in the Garb of Luxury appear?</L>
<L>Can These e'er pierce the Lover with a Glance?</L>
<L>Or grace the Tragic Scene with Pity's Tear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps in this drear Mansion are confin'd</L>
<L>Some whose accomplish'd Beauty cou'd impart</L>
<L>The soft Desire to the severest Mind,</L>
<L>And wake to Extacy the throbbing Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But splendid Life in each Allurement drest</L>
<L>Attracts Them not, tho' flush'd with youthful Bloom:</L>
<L>Stern Pennance chills the Ardour of their Breast,</L>
<L>And buries their Ambition in this Gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full many a Riv'let steals its gentle Way</L>
<L>Unheard, untasted, by the thirsty Swain,</L>
<L>Full many a <HI>Philomel</HI> attunes her Lay,</L>
<L>And pours her plaintive Melody in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>Some veil'd <HI>Eliza</HI> (like the clouded Sun)</L>
<L>May here reside inglorious and unknown;</L>
<L>Some, like <HI>Augusta,</HI> might have rear'd a Son</L>
<L>To bless a Nation and adorn a Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Flatt'ry's Lip to drink the Sweets of Praise,</L>
<L>In Wit and Charms with other Belles to vie,</L>
<L>In Circles to attract the partial Gaze</L>
<L>And view Their Beauty in th' Admirer's Eye</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Lot forbids: nor does alone remove</L>
<L>The Thirst of Praise, but e'en their Vices chains,</L>
<L>Forbids thro' Folly's Labyrinth to rove,</L>
<L>And yield to Pleasure the unheeded reins:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To raise mid Hymen's Joys domestic Strife,</L>
<L>Or seek that Converse which They ought to shun,</L>
<L>To break the sacred Ties of married Life</L>
<L>And give to many what they vow'd to one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>Far from the Bustle of the splendid Throng</L>
<L>They tread Obscurity's sequester'd Vale,</L>
<L>Where the white Hours glide silently along</L>
<L>Smooth as the Stream, when sleeps the breezy Gale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet tho' they're sprinkled with ethereal Dew?</L>
<L>With blooming Wreaths by Hands of Seraphs crown'd?</L>
<L>Tho' Heav'n's eternal Splendors burst to View?</L>
<L>And Harps celestial to their Ear resound?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still grateful Mem'ry paints the absent Friend,</L>
<L>Not ev'n the World to their Remembrance dies:</L>
<L>Their Mid-night Orisons to Heav'n ascend</L>
<L>To stop the Bolt descending from the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For who entranc'd, in Visions from above</L>
<L>The Thought of Kindred razes from the Mind?</L>
<L>Feels in the Soul no warm returning Love</L>
<L>For some endear'd Companion left behind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>From Friendship's Breast reluctant they withdrew,</L>
<L>And with a Sigh forsook their native Air:</L>
<L>To their fond Parents when they bad Adieu</L>
<L>Gush'd from their Eye the tender filial Tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Thee, who mindful of th' encloyster'd Fair</L>
<L>Dost in these Lines their artless Tale relate,</L>
<L>If Chance in distant Time's revolving Year</L>
<L>Some kindred Spirit shall enquire thy Fate,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haply some aged Vestal may reply,</L>
<L>"Oft have we seen Him 'ere <HI>Aurora</HI>'s Ray</L>
<L>"Had faintly ting'd with red the op'ning Sky,</L>
<L>"Hasten to Church, and join the Matin Lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"There at the Tomb where <HI>Eloisa</HI> lies,</L>
<L>"He'd read th' Inscription: and her Fate condole,</L>
<L>"Then in his Breast, as Scenes of Grief arise,</L>
<L>"Sigh the kind Requiem to her gentle Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>"Against yon Pillar careless now He'd lean,</L>
<L>"Smiling at what his wayward Fancy moves:</L>
<L>"Now drooping, wan, and pensive, wou'd be seen</L>
<L>"As one abandon'd by the Fair He loves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"One Morn I miss'd Him in the aweful Dome</L>
<L>"Along the Isle, and in the Sacristy:</L>
<L>"Another came, nor yet beside the Tomb,</L>
<L>"Nor at the Font, nor in the Porch was He.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The next we heard, which did our Wonder move,</L>
<L>"He was departed to return no more,</L>
<L>"Yet lest the sudden Change we shou'd reprove,</L>
<L>"These Lines He sent us from <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"What Time in Transport lost the Naïad Throng,</L>
<L>"First catch'd their <HI>Akenside</HI>'s enchanting Lay,</L>
<L>"And raptur'd Fancy listen'd to the Song</L>
<L>"Of laurel'd <HI>Whitehead,</HI> and sweet-plaintive <HI>Gray."</HI></L>

<HEAD>The LETTER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Vestal Fair (Her Name I may'nt unfold)</L>
<L>Has planted in my Breast the pleasing Dart;</L>
<L>Who by relentless Vows, if not controll'd,</L>
<L>Wou'd own, perchance, a Sympathy of Heart:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The growing Passion impotent to quell,</L>
<L>Severe Discretion urg'd me to retreat;</L>
<L>Now at my native rural Home I dwell,</L>
<L>Where Contemplation keeps her lonely Seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seek not to draw me from this still Abode,</L>
<L>Where the kind Muses to my Aid repair,</L>
<L>And when the Thoughts of hapless Love corrode,</L>
<L>Check the deep Sigh, and wipe the trickling Tear.</L>
