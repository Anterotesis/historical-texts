<HEAD>On seeing Miss YOUNGE in the Character of Lady FLIPPANT SAVAGE.</HEAD>
<L>THE two scenic Muses had long kept a distance,</L>
<L>And scorn'd of each other to borrow assistance;</L>
<L>THALIA was pert, and MELPOMENE proud,</L>
<L>And though of admirers they both had a croud;</L>
<L>Not two rival beauties on earth could be seen</L>
<L>More tortur'd with jealousy, envy and spleen:</L>
<L>Till JOVE, to whom all the celestials submit,</L>
<L>In matters of WEIGHT, or in matters of WIT,</L>
<L>Interpos'd his command, saying, henceforth agree,</L>
<L>United in friendship as Sisters should be;</L>
<L>And grant, as a pledge that your union's sincere,</L>
<L>Your mutual pow'rs to some favourite fair;</L>
<L>If one can be found amongst mortals below</L>
<L>Deserving the attributes you can bestow.</L>
<L>The Sisters obey'd; but unfix'd was their choice,</L>
<L>Till MINERVA appearing with soul-moving voice:</L>
<L>While in scales of suspense both their fancies were hung,</L>
<L>Appeal'd to their senses, and pointed to YOUNGE.</L>
<L>To YOUNGE, where the <HI>smile-stealing comic</HI> we find,</L>
<L>With the <HI>soft,</HI> the <HI>sublime,</HI> and the <HI>graceful</HI> combin'd.</L>
<L>To YOUNGE who can each diff'rent passion impart,</L>
<L>Who <HI>pleases</HI> the <HI>judgement,</HI> but <HI>conquers</HI> the <HI>heart,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>guided</HI> by NATURE, is <HI>followed</HI> by ART.</L>

<SP>
<L>IN Shakespeare's days we only play'd the fool,</L>
<L>And men of fashion gave—not took—the rule;</L>
<L>Then Lords were grave, and ladies graver still,</L>
<L>And only <HI>we,</HI> and clowns had wit at will;</L>
<L>His mind rejected former classic lore,</L>
<L>And drew from Nature's never-ending store.</L>
<L>But authors <HI>now</HI>—we often prove the fact,</L>
<L>Must fashion court, to teach us how to act.</L>
<L>Expose the follies which our statutes spare,</L>
<L>And unprotected Virtue make their care.</L>
<L>All nature <HI>now</HI> is <HI>custom;—custom, law</HI>;</L>
<L>And here we bring—not what we think,—but saw.</L>
<L>Tis hard to vary your dramatic mirth,</L>
<L>When every folly gives it likeness birth.</L>
<L>Which though, in life, your laugh they may command,</L>
<L>Will rather pall, than please, at second hand.</L>
<L>'Tis harder still to suit the general mind,</L>
<L>And all our audience in our int'rest bind.</L>
<L>Honest John Bull, vex'd with the cares of life,</L>
<L>With heavy taxes and a scolding wife,</L>
<L>Wishes some hours in hearing us to waste,</L>
<L>And <HI>galloping dreary Dun</HI> is quite his taste.—</L>
<L>Sir Foppling too, his brains with claret addle,</L>
<L>Pronounces <HI>Comedy</HI> to be a <HI>Twaddle</HI>!</L>
<L>His Lordship by the privilege of folly,</L>
<L>Is neither musical nor melancholy;</L>
<L>Thinks every honest bard <HI>a queer old Put,</HI>—</L>
<L>"Damme! there's nothing in a play like <HI>smut!</HI></L>
<L>The politician's all-commanding pate,</L>
<L>Would have us dramatize th' affairs of state:</L>
<L>Make whigs and tories fight, here face to face,</L>
<L>And teach the patriots, <HI>Unity of Place.</HI>—</L>
<L>Some cry for sentiment, and some for wit,</L>
<L>And yet our claim to either won't admit.—</L>
<L>The Critic Bench!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Looking into the Pit.</NOTE> for which there's no appeal,</L>
<L>Since for the town they judge, and act, and feel.</L>
<L>Did you but know what pangs an author shares,</L>
<L>How throbs his heart with anxious doubts and cares!</L>
<L>Let past indulgence your attention keep:</L>
<L>Though we be dull—<HI>Justice</HI> should never <HI>sleep.</HI></L>
<L>And if to-night no merit we can claim,</L>
<L>The want of <HI>power,</HI> not <HI>will,</HI> deserves the blame!</L>

<P>Why, I do; in London there's such a noise—such rattling of carts, waggons, coaches, chariots and vis-a-vis; then at night its so charm∣ing to see the flambeaux flying about from house to house, like blazing stars!—But what have you got there for my lady, Mrs. Muslin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>A few cards of laces.</P>

Heigh ho! I'm all langour and lassitude!—Never knew Bath so dull—Scarce any person of fashion—Nobody one knows—This patch has a pretty effect—And you may go, Grace; and do you hear, Grace, let Miss Constance know I shall be ready to go out in half an hour.</P>

<P>I ask your ladyship's pardon; I saw Sir Buzzard with Colonel Staff, and Mr. Cheaterly in the great parlour.—But I have something to mention to your ladyship—here are the laces—

but it is not about the laces I want to speak—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what?—Heigh ho! hand me the Olympian dew—Muslin, I saw a charming fellow at the play last night, and he saw me—Lady Holden certainly pencils her eye-brows—But the charming fellow, he took up my whole attention from the performance—I flatter myself I engaged his—his eyes were never off me—was dressed in a new Parisian frock.—Hand me the volatile salts, Muslin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lodger, I protest!—pick'd the pinion of a chicken at my humble table, last night, and never ceased talking of your ladyship.</P>

<P>Heav'ns, said he, what an air!—what grace! then run on in praise of your lady∣ship's person and beauty; but when he heard your ladyship was married, poor youth, how piteously he sigh'd.</P>

<P>Good natured charitable soul!—but his name—who is he?—what is he? whence came he?—and who are his relations, Mus∣lin?</P>
</SP>

<P>Cannot answer one of your ladyship's questions, except that his name is Welford; he came to my house yesterday, and talks of leav∣ing Bath to-morrow morning.</P>

Come to demand his winnings;—lost two hun∣dred last night, could think of no card but the knave of hearts I saw at the Theatre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The knave—the king of hearts your ladyship means; and let me tell you a trump—never saw finer eyes; then he has the leg of a soldier, and the hand of a lady—but is he to have the honor of—</P>

<P>Of what?</P>

<P>Perhaps letters from some of my friends in Paris.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a giddy creature am I? but a body must kill time—then the fellow is so elegant,
<STAGE>(rises)</STAGE>
and Sir Buzzard so peevish!—the fatigue and apprehension which body and mind suffer after an unluckly run, are in∣supportable; my nerves are quite out of tune, but Muslin has in some degree elevated my spirits.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="5" REF="11"/><HI>Enter</HI> CHEATERLY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I condole with your ladyship on your hard run last night; the aces conspired against you;—Renounce brag, the cunning of the game lies, not in—judgment of mind, but in com∣mand of muscles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>To which I impute your uninter∣rupted series of good luck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am unfit for brag;—the warmth of my heart, particularly in your ladyship's pre∣sence,
<STAGE>(bows low.)</STAGE>
keeps my features in conti∣nual rebellion,—but no person with a flexible countenance should touch brag, the impene∣trable looks of lady Frigid Midnight, have established her an adept at the game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her nimble fingers give her command of the cards; but she lost temper when I got the black knaves; it was when you stood on my right, and lord Lackacre on my left hand.—"I have got the black knaves," said I, "Lady Frigid"—"I see you have," said she, pointing to you and my lord,—then, as she puckered up her mouth in an affected smile, down fell a few flakes of paint, and her skin appeared under the fractures, like <HI>old</HI> brick work peeping through the <HI>new</HI> invented compo∣sition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her countenance was once tolerable, but a long run of ill luck, has stamp'd that ir∣risible discordancy, of hill and dale, which marks her visage, and prevents the smiles of fortune, joy, or good humour, from unbending her to a laugh, or the smallest semblage of the amiable.
<STAGE>(<HI>Hums a tune.</HI>)</STAGE>
There is a small matter between us, for which I have a very pressing occasion.</P>

I expected this! Ha! ha! ha! I cannot but laugh at your description of Lady Frigid.</P>

<P>For heav'n's sake say no more of her;—but, let me have the money.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have bills to pay—my mercer, milliner, and mantua-maker, are to be with me to-morrow, and people of that class, you know, are rude and importunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose I point out a mode of discharging this debt of honour without dimi∣nishing your ladyship's purse—what say you?</P>

<P>If you have any thing to propose I can honourably receive, speak out.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And wou'd you have me accessary to the ruin of a young creature?</P>

<P>There is no ruin intended;—I have open'd my mind to the lady,—Sir Buzzard is my friend, and I only solicit your interest; I would marry Constance.</P>

<P>No ruin intended! could a greater curse befal a young creature than to marry you!—who are you, Sir?</P>

<P>Who am I, madam! a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't mean to asperse your birth, Sir; but is not your ruling passion play; your principal dependance cards and dice; your most intimate connections jockies, grooms, game∣cocks, and race-horses? I am surprized you could look up to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My fortune and family entitle me to look up to any woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it must be merely to look up; you are, no doubt, one of Fortune's favourites, and her favours follow you;—you have large estates in expectancy, and considerable rents in Bath, Wells, Scarborough, Southampton and Margate; nay, more, you have as many agents as the first landed gentleman in the country.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your connexions, manners and con∣versation

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arts and sciences of play—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I insinuate nothing injurious to your profession; the respect which professors of play receive in preference to all other professors proves it a profession the most l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beral, as well as most profitable.

<P>She will never forgive the insult of preferring another woman to herself;

Your tradesmen's bills, madam, are unpaid, your ladyship's mercer and milliner—and people of that class are so importunate and rude;—I do not solicit you to take an active part in my fa∣vour, only promise not to be an enemy, and the debt of honour is cancelled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say the debt of honour shall be cancelled. Are you aware that Constance has bestowed her favours on young De Courcy, of York.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and that his passion for play was cooled at the last York races, which obliged him to take a trip to France for the recovery of his finances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his losses she imputes to a con∣spiracy between you and those friends of yours, who were the ostensible winners, and to whom you introduced him;—I sear you have no chance.</P>

<P>Chance!—leave me to that;—I have often won with the odds against me; then she is a beggar, but my passion is disinterested.</P>

Her modest blush puts even my impudence out of countenance!—your so∣licitude, madam, to avoid me, so strongly in∣dicates apathy to my addresses, I almost dread the possibility of convincing you I am sincere;—do not turn from me in scorn; I may have some claim upon your gratitude, though no in∣terest in your heart.</P>

<P>I acknowledge my weakness in pursu∣ing the impulse of my passion; reason checks me, but such is the imperious violence of my affection, that even your scorn increases my de∣sires, by making you lovely in the midst of an∣ger, and the blessing I sigh for, appears still more valuable, more worthy pursuit, from the distant prospect you give me of the possession.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, and what adds to the grievance, if a young fellow marries an heiress, he is obliged to settle her fortune on herself, though, per∣haps, her person was a secondary object,—I shall never succeed here, Sir Buzzard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pish, why not succeed; a hundred to one but all she has said is pretence,—you know nothing of women's subtilty; they smile, they frown, they laugh, they weep, they move but to deceive us, and lay a snare in every ar∣ticle of their dress.</P>

<P>Cheaterly, I must look about me; I came down here for the recovery of my health, and am suffering under a precipitate consump∣tion of my purse. Do you think the young clergyman plays fair?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here comes Colonel Staff and old Ordeal yoked together, very naturally, as two asses should be;—I despise them both: the Co∣lonel never served abroad, yet he prates as bold as if he had experienced half a dozen foreign campaigns.</P>

<P>Yes, but hopes to mend his fortune by marrying my sister; I wish him success, that they may mutually torment each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mark Ordeal, he is not a less extraor∣dinary character than the Colonel, the fellow was a foundling, and never knew his parents, but having acquired a fortune by trade, impu∣dently insults his betters, by preaching what he calls generosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, confound his generosity, he is al∣ways setting a bad example with his charities,
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
relieving widows, providing for orphans, and portioning off young maidens; though igno∣rant as a Hottentot, he has got himself rank'd among the literati, and sets up for a philosopher—the fellow has come into life through as many shapes as an Orkney Barnacle, he was first a block, then a worm, and is now a goose.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! I have been accusing Or∣deal of avarice, and he denies the charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, avarice, though too often an at∣tendant on age, is a vice foreign to my nature; no man can accuse me of accumulating money by unjust means, or of hoarding it when in my possession; whereas avarice is a dropsy of the mind—a disease that irritates and increases by the means used to assuage its thirst.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not refused to lend me a mere trifle, and being rich, is not that a proof of ava∣rice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me;—I consider myself an agent, bound to answer for the distribution of that wealth with which heaven has bless'd my indus∣try—the charge of avarice is more applicable to the spendthrift than the prudent, the spendthrift grasps at every man's property; yet no man is ac∣counted avaricious who conforms to the custom of dissipation; though the spendthrift raises his rents, and starves his tenantry—borrows money and ruins his friend, or runs in debt, and makes bankrupts of his tradesmen, if he drives a car∣riage—keeps a train of servants, plays, drinks, and plunges into vice, the world will call him a damn'd generous fellow—I speak my mind—that's my way.</P>

<P>The widow has a considerable share of the <HI>toujours gai</HI> in her composition.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too much to promise constancy; but then you old bachelors have such winning ways—but Colonel, keep a centinel on my sister—time and possession are two dangerous pioneers; the first moulders the cement by degrees; and the other saps the foundation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the widow is so frank, degagé and good natured, she may grant favors from charity and sensibility, which other women would refuse from principle, or the prejudice of education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Mr. Cheaterly has advanced, contains profound gravity of judgment; but my Clary shall have no modern education, I have engaged a master to teach her the Clas∣sics, to manure the soil by cultivating the seeds of virtue;—yes, I will have Clary cultivated; for she is innocence itself: free from the bias of example, she is guided only by the impulse of pure nature.</P>

<P>And no doubt she will bring you an heir in return, and then bury you.</P>

<P>Family, I understand your sneer, I was a foundling it is true, and cannot boast ances∣try; yet I have a heart susceptible of the tender feelings and sweet solicitudes of humanity.

<P>There is another kind,—give me your hand—there is a love known by its effects, it beats on the pulse, trembles on the breath, gives eyes to the thoughts, and thoughts to the eyes.</P>

<P>O la! then I'm sure you are in love, for your eyes speak and laugh,—why did you touch my hand?—indeed—indeed, I'm afraid I have taken it from you—I hope there's no danger in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Love is the child of desire, nurs'd by delight—weaned by inconstancy, consumed by neglect, kill'd by dissembling, and buried by ingratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cruel to kill it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then 'tis the parent of jealousy, the disuniter of friendship, and cause of disobe∣dience; an arbitrary tyrant of the mind, that triumphs over wisdom, tramples upon pru∣dence, and vanquishes even virtue.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you fright me with that description.</P>

<P>Now that is delightful! and to tell you the truth I have heard my guardian speak of it, but I could never feel it in his hand as I did in your's; he says—"love is fire full of cold—honey full of gall—and pleasure full of pain;"—but I see he knows nothing of the matter;—are you really in love?</P>

<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>An amiable, modest creature, Mr. M'Classic—nothing ardent in her disposition, has no more idea of love than an infant, yet a charming fertilizing constitution, but chaste as ice,—"her heart like the salamander—cold, cold, in the midst of flame."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Virtue beams in her een, and animates her countenance; like the finishing touches of the painter, it enlivens the portrait, and in∣creases the beauty of the object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poetically conceiv'd, and prettily pro∣nounc'd;—yes, she shrinks from the touch like the sensitive plant—you have a prolific imagi∣nation, Mr. M'Classic, considering you come from a northern climate

—yet Mr. M'Classic, there is no judging of a woman's chastity, who has never been in the way of temptation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And women are virtuous in proportion to the temptations they withstand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>A just conclusion, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think it would be difficult to find a young inexperienced girl proof against promises, sighs and tears—and who could with∣stand the cunning insinuations of a lover.</P>

<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I think differently; I think I could trust Clara—but she's a nonpareil—yes, cool as a cucumber in a hot bed—yet not prone to vegetation—but M'Classic, I have an expe∣riment to make, and you must assist me.</P>

<P>Sir, there can be no doubt; but you were speaking of an experiment, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have fortified her mind with morals, which will prove a shield to her by day, and a breast-plate by night.—But the experiment—you must be my instrument.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what respect, Sir?</P>

<P>In the morning—I have had a special licence sometime—yes, she loves me—I know she loves me—and soon as we have dined, I will go to Sir Buzzard's, to engage him and his friends to attend the ceremony.

<P>To that name I was born, but an old good natured uncle taking it into his head to visit elizium—in obedience to his will, and in gra∣titude for sixteen hundred pounds a year, I now bear the name and arms of Welford.</P>

<P>You seem an honest fellow, worthy the love of Constance.</P>

<P>What is his honesty to me? I am to inform you, Sir, the father of Constance is dead; I am her natural guardian, and you shall never have my consent to marry her.</P>

<P>To avoid him!—He is a noble fellow, and she must have him;—I will in to Sir Buz∣zard, and argue this case:—He presumes to controul this young lady, his niece, by paren∣tal authority; but I will convince him, the principle of that authority is to make our chil∣dren or wards happy,—not miserable.</P>

amicable girl—I really love her, pity her situa∣tion, and am determined never to see Welford again, but for the purpose of facilitating a marriage between them.—I must also effectuate a breach between my sister and this pusilani∣mous colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That may be easily accomplished—the widow has no small share of vanity.</P>

<P>De Courcy is gone, after a very loud altercation with Cheaterly, which terminated in mutual vows of vengeance; he charges Cheaterly with having imposed on him at play.</P>

<P>There is nothing scandalous in that—play has become a science, fashionable in prac∣tice, and like other <HI>faux pas,</HI> 'tis only blameable in discovery. Pray how has Constance behaved?</P>

<P>Yes, if you tell nothing but the truth.</P>

<P>Then to bestow it on Welford—think of the pleasure of sweet five and twenty smiling upon you from morning 'till night.</P>

<P>In truth, love itself; if the pleasing de∣scription you have given me be true, and I have no reason to doubt your veracity, to live with those we love must be the extent of human happiness;—but then, Mr. Ordeal has told me that your sex often requite the most sincere pas∣sion with cold indifference.</P>

<P>The charge is too true; but my affec∣tion can only cease with life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cla.</SPEAKER>
<P>I owe every thing to Mr. Ordeal's good∣ness, and the very arguments you urged to gain my love, persuade me against being un∣grateful!—obedience is the only return I can make his kindness, and how can I disobey him, when my heart informs me that ingratitude is

one of those heinous sins at which Heaven is most offended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, no quality of the soul is more lovely than gratitude;—but Mr. Ordeal is not actuated by passion,—he offers you his hand from motives of generosity, not love,—all you owe him is friendship, which an union with me could not diminish.</P>
</SP>

<P>I know it is almost time; I believe your inclinations are virtuous, and your irregularities I do not impute to nature;—no, my lady, na∣ture has endowed you with amiable qualities, among which, I think generosity is prevalent—like most of your sex, you have taken up levity through whim, and maintain it through habit, though perhaps your soul struggles to be de∣livered from the trammels;—break them, then, and you will do more than Caesar;—he con∣quered countries,—but the greatest glory human nature can acquire is to conquer ourselves;—I have good news for Constance,—her father is living.</P>

<P>I see into it, this accounts for the warm impetuous passion of Cheaterly; the girl and her fortune were no doubt to be sacrificed, between him and my worthy spouse.

<P>I hope so!—but I believe nothing with∣out proof—that is my way—where there is le∣vity the world will suspect, and when the world has once cause to suspect a woman, her cha∣racter becomes as much the sport of its ma∣lice, as if there was a certainty of her having abandoned it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>In his private chamber, and just sprung from his arms!—Oh, hell and furies! but I will be cool,—we, Sir, will meet hereafter; this intrusion, madam, is, I see, as unseasonable as unexpected; I am sorry to have interrupted you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am unconcerned at your suspicions, Colonel,—you will not be censorious, Miss Constance—my business here was to prevent that imprudent step which you are about to take.</P>

<P>I am sorty, Sir, for the confusion I have caused—having gained my esteem without dif∣ficulty—you have resign'd it with the same ease—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>To the</HI> Widow)</STAGE>
This undeniable proof of your duplicity has reinstated my senses, and I will run the gauntlet no longer—you feel am calm—quite calm,—but I will have revenge;—you, Sir?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir!—it is my duty to clear this lady from suspicion, to which her situation lays her open, and in which I am innocently in∣volved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may have an interest in justifying yourself, Sir, but I request not to be included in your defence; I am going.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your acts and deeds! Yes, I have heard of your acts and deeds from yourself, Colo∣nel—but, be assured, a man without spirit shall never controul the acts and deeds of my for∣tune.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Constance, will you attend to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir,—you need not take the trouble
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>
of speaking to me now, or of enquiring for me hereafter.
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI> Constance.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever man so unfortunate!—to have all my wishes blasted in the moment of ripening!—to lose the object of my love in the instant of recovering her—who waits there? to have an intrigue with a wife, a widow, and a maid, in the course of one day, and be dis∣appointed in all—will nobody answer?

<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>What answer has Doctor Spruce sent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He said, Sir, he would not write,—but remember your ungenerous treatment, and have revenge!—pardon me, Sir, but these were his words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would have revenge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and I saw a letter on his table directed to Sir Buzzard Savage;—there was an
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
attorney with him, and I heard him say the pe∣nalty is treble the money lost.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>How much is he arrested for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upwards of seventy pounds.</P>

<P>Here is a note for a hundred—

<STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<P>A letter to Sir Buzzard!—an attorney with him!—treble the penalty!—this Spruce I fear will turn traitor.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> DOUGLAS.</STAGE>
<P>Captain Douglas, your most obedient,—how long have you been in Bath? I have not seen you for an age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Sir, not since the York meet∣ing, when my friend De Courcy lost his mo∣ney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is too ardent to attempt play,—always off his guard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>And had the misfortune to play with those who kept a constant centinel upon his weakness;—he confided in you, and was de∣ceived;—care, and a plain understanding, may preserve a man's property from the plunder of a common robber,—but honesty has no pro∣tection from the frauds of superior cunning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won nothing from him;—I lost—the truth is, the knowing ones took us in.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you shared the winnings—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you dare—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will dare any thing that is honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friend, Sir, has dared to traduce my character, by the imputation you insinuate. But he and you should know me better, than to suppose any man could affront me with impuni∣ty.
<STAGE>(<HI>lays his hand on his sword.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you have a mind capable of vindicating your conduct, even at the risque of your own life, and the life of him you have in∣jured—men like you, habituated in deceit, be∣come callous to humanity;—destitute of prin∣ciple,—they are not deterred by the compunc∣tions of conscience,—but will insure the profits of their cunning, even at the price of blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My family, Sir—</P>

<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you traitor!—the reverend Mr▪ Spruce has made a full confession.—So I have been your pigeon, but the law shall do me justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheat.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is your scheme, pusillanimous, mean wretch—
<STAGE>(<HI>to Sir Buzzard</HI>)</STAGE>
for you, Sir,
<STAGE>(<HI>to Douglas</HI>)</STAGE>
we shall meet again.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Cheaterly.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes,—at the next assizes;—the fel∣low's mind is sowed with hempseed, and will yet produce a halter.—or if he escapes hanging, I shall see him perishing in a gaol, under as many wants as are in the Daily Advertiser;—have you been pigeon'd, Sir?</P>

<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have,—he has pluck'd some quill feathers from me,—he has pinion'd me!—oh the rascal!—but I shall recover my mortgages, and bonds, with treble penalties!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Distraction!—she is lost!—I have been at your house, my Lady,—at Mr. Ordeal's—at every inn in the town,—but can get no tidings of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is surprising, you, who possess a heart open and liberal, panting with affection for the whole sex, should run distracted for the loss of an individual!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doug.</SPEAKER>
<P>You overlook me, Welford—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Douglas!—my friend!—O, Douglas, I have lost my Constance!—I—</P>

<P>What!—marry me, an orphan without a shilling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk not of wealth,—were the riches of the world in your possession, by Heaven they would not add a grain to the estimation of your worth.</P>
</SP>

<P>Generous and noble!</P>

<SPEAKER>Con.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>to Ord.</HI>)</STAGE>
How, Sir, can I repay your generosity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>The satisfaction which results from aid∣ing virtue in distress, is the only interest a ge∣nerous mind can wish to receive for its ser∣vices;—because it is the only interest such a mind can enjoy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Return to my house;—there you shall be acquainted with a matter which nearly concerns your happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which I never expect to taste!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your happiness is in your own power, commence the practice of virtue, and you will be enamoured of its sweets,—try the experiment, and never fear success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flip.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you to that, Sir Buz∣zard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Buz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say a man can never be too old to mend—I say I have been positive all my life, and I say if you follow the advice of your an∣cient and sapient friend, my endeavours to pro∣cure domestic happiness shall not be wanting—Ordeal, the laugh will be against us both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laugh at me as long as you please, but had I married Clara, the laugh would have been still stronger against me;—the Scot has done right, and the girl has done right,—the mutual inclination of two virtuous souls, cannot but render them more virtuous;—the inhabitants of countries united by nature and policy should take every opportunity of strength∣ening the connexion;—I see you all think as I do!—and here I hope we shall also meet approbation.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE To FASHIONABLE LEVITIES.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>(As spoken by Miss YOUNGE.)</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>OUR growing Levities too clearly show,</L>
<L>That all our troubles from refinement flow.</L>
<L>Two ages since we valu'd plain attire,</L>
<L>Blue-apron'd was the Dame, straight-hair'd the Squire;</L>
<L>They call'd not houshold bus'ness vulgar cares,</L>
<L>Nor deem'd it ungenteel to say their pray'rs:</L>
<L>But arts improv'd, new Levities arose,</L>
<L>And Ladies chang'd the fashion of their clothes;</L>
<L>Hoop'd petticoats in ev'ry town were seen:</L>
<L>The snug rotunda pleas'd the virgin Queen,</L>
<L>And beef for breakfast serv'd her Lady-train;</L>
<L>No wonder that her sailors baffled Spain.</L>
<L>Yet still we've chiefs with love of glory fir'd;</L>
<L>But so had Rome when liberty expired;</L>
<L>"We've statesmen too, who burn with patriots flame,</L>
<L>"But so had Greece, when Greece had lost her fame."</L>
<L>"We've admirals who plow the briny deep,</L>
<L>"Through azure skies and rolling clouds they sweep,</L>
<L>"Invade the Planets in an Air Balloon,</L>
<L>"And fright from her propriety the Moon"—</L>
<L>Bess was a man, when danger call'd her pow'rs,</L>
<L>She was a woman in her private hours—</L>
<L>Few Levities, few luxuries she knew;</L>
<L>No cherries then in February grew:</L>
<L>May-dukes in April on the bough hung green,</L>
<L>And girls wore hanging-sleeves till full eighteen.</L>
<L>Few mothers teach their daughters grace or sense▪</L>
<L>But tell them taste in dress is excellence:</L>
<L>Bid them the Levities of rank assume,</L>
<L>And flaunt with spreading bow, or nodding plume;</L>
<L><PB REF="100"/>Strut in a riding-dress, to shew their shapes;</L>
<L>Or stalk in boots, and coats with tripple capes.</L>
<L>Affecting ease, but impudently free,</L>
<L>The matron leans upon her cicisbee;</L>
<L>While <HI>cara sposa</HI> snugly keeps his wench,</L>
<L>Defies his duns, and revels in the Bench.</L>
<L>"Why, this is vice, not folly?" I agree;</L>
<L>But still this vice proceeds from Levity.</L>
<L>Some souls there are which moral sense sublimes,</L>
<L>A few blest spirits in the worst of times;</L>
<L>One in whom birth and piety are join'd;</L>
<L>Of native worth, and truly royal mind;</L>
<L>Who with benignant hand her blessings pours;</L>
<L>Who knows no Levities, but feels for yours.</L>
