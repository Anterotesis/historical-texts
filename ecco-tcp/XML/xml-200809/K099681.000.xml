<L>TO Science sacred, Muse, exalt thy Lays,</L>
<L>Science of Nature and to Nature's Praise:</L>
<L>Attend ye Virtuous, and rejoice to know</L>
<L>Her mystic Labours, and her Laws below;</L>
<L>Her ways above with curious Eyes explore,</L>
<L>Admire her Treasures, and her God adore.</L>

<L>BEHOLD ye FAIR how radiant Colours glow,</L>
<L>What dyes the Rose, what paints the Heav'nly Bow,</L>
<L>The purpling Shade, the rich refracted Ray,</L>
<L>And all the bright Diversity of Day.</L>
<L>Lo! here the Magne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Magic charms the Sight,</L>
<L>And fills the Soul with Wonder and Delight,</L>
<L>In her coy Nature turns her Face aside,</L>
<L>And mocks th' enquiring Sages learned Pride,</L>
<L>Here less reserv'd she shows her plainer Course</L>
<L>In mutual Contest of Elastic Force,</L>
<L>Saving each vital Frame from crushing Fate,</L>
<L>For inward Act sustains external Weight.</L>
<L>Which holds reciprocal in ballanc'd Strife,</L>
<L>The Shield of Nature, and the Fence of Life:</L>
<L>The ambient Atmosphere embracing all</L>
<L>The wide Circumf'rence of this circling Ball,</L>
<L>The Vehicle of Life to those that breath</L>
<L>On solid Land, or liquid Waves beneath;</L>
<L>The Universe pervading, filling Space,</L>
<L>And like its Maker unconfin'd to Place.</L>

<L>WHAT pleasing Fervours in my Bosom rise,</L>
<L>What fix'd Attention and what deep Surprize,</L>
<L>When quick as Thought th' electric Vigour springs,</L>
<L>Swifter than Light'ning on its rapid Wings,</L>
<L>A Flight so instant to no Space confin'd,</L>
<L>Eludes Ideas, and outstrips the Mind?</L>
<L>Lo! to the Brain the bright Effluvium flies,</L>
<L>Glows in the Heart and flashes from the Eyes:</L>

<L>And proudly warm, enjoy th' extatic Blaze:</L>
<L>See the proud Nymph partake his Flame by Turns,</L>
<L>See! like a Seraph, how she smiles and burns.</L>
<L>Contracted here by wond'rous Art is seen</L>
<L>A boundless System in a small Machine;</L>
<L>Here human Skill to proud Perfection brought,</L>
<L>The mortal Mimic of Omnific Thought,</L>
<L>Th' Almighty's Model to the Mind conveys,</L>
<L>The Universe, and all it's Pow'rs displays:</L>
<L>How wander Planets, how revolves the Year,</L>
<L>The Moon how changes, and how Comets glare.</L>

<L>While waiting Worlds enjoy by Turns his Face,</L>
<L>From his bright Presence drink enliv'ning Rays,</L>
<L>From him their Seasons gain, from him their Days;</L>
<L>See Wisdom here her brightest Beams display,</L>
<L>To fill the Soul with philosophic Day,</L>
<L>The Springs unfolding of mechanic Laws,</L>
<L>Tracing through known Effects th' eternal Cause,</L>
<L>Whose pow'rful <HI>Fiat▪</HI> whose creative Will</L>

<L>Shows wedded Worlds far distant Worlds embrace</L>
<L>With mutual Bands, yet keep their destin'd Space,</L>
<L>Roll endless Measures through th' etherial Plain,</L>
<L>Link'd by the social strong attractive Chain,</L>
<L>Whose latent Springs exert all Nature's Force,</L>
<L>Inwrap the Poles, and point the Stars their Course.</L>

<L>The Sons of Wisdom seek thy Source in vain;</L>
<L>Thyself invisible, yet seen thy Laws,</L>
<L>This goodly Fabrick thy Effect, and GOD thy Cause.</L>

<L>THRICE happy few who wisely here attend</L>
<L>The Voice of Science, and her Cause befriend:</L>
<L>Let others, heedless of their youthful Prime,</L>
<L>Squander on empty Toys their fleeting Time;</L>
<L>'Tis yours with Reason's searching Eye to view</L>
<L>Great Nature's Laws, and trace her winding Clue;</L>
<L>Behold her Book the op'ning Page expand,</L>
<L>Fill'd with the Wonders of her Maker's Hand,</L>
<L>In awful Characters, which clearly shine,</L>
<L>Worthy of Wisdom, and of Pow'r divine.</L>
<L>Peruse GOD's Ways, his perfect Workings trace,</L>
<L>In Nature's Mirrour shines his heavenly Face.</L>

<L>To you, bright Nymphs, where Goodness charms us most,</L>
<L>The Pride of Nature, and Creation's Boast,</L>
<L>To you Philosophy enamour'd flies,</L>
<L>And triumphs in the Plaudit of your Eyes.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="015750200000070"/>When Worth like yours her sapient Throne sustains,</L>
<L>The Queen of Science with true Splendour reigns;</L>
<L>By Beauty aided she extends her Sway,</L>
<L>And, won by you, Mankind glad Homage pay.</L>
