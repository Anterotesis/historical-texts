<L>'TIS strange that authors, who so rarely find</L>
<L>Their pray'rs can move an audience to be kind,</L>
<L>Still send, with piteous tone and look forlorn,</L>
<L>The Prologue forth to deprecate your scorn;</L>
<L>Such doleful heralds, which would fain appear</L>
<L>The timid struggles of a modest fear,</L>
<L>The surly Critic views with jealous spleen,</L>
<L>As the dull presage of the coming scene.</L>
<L>In vain, the dread hostility to calm,</L>
<L>E'en potent Flatt'ry tries her soothing balm;</L>
<L>Pity's a crime his losty soul disdains</L>
<L>And his pride feasts upon the poet's pains,</L>
<L>Yet now no critic rancour need we fear,</L>
<L>For lib'ral candour holds her empire here,</L>
<L>Candour, who scorns for little faults to pry,</L>
<L>But looks on merits with a partial eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sure a bard whose muse so oft has found</L>
<L>The happy pow'r to kindle mirth around,</L>
<L>Though, in her sportive moods, averse to trace,</L>
<L>The rigid forms of <HI>Action, Time,</HI> and <HI>Place,</HI></L>
<L>While gen'rous objects animate her view,</L>
<L>May still her gay luxuriant course pursue;</L>
<L>For, mid her whims, she still has shewn the art,</L>
<L>To press the USEFUL MORAL on the heart;</L>
<L>With just contempt the worthless to discard,</L>
<L>And deal to VIRTUE its deserv'd reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So aim'd the bard <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HORACE.</NOTE> (if haply we may dare,</L>
<L>Our humble scenes with noblest strains compare)</L>
<L>The bard whose favour'd muse could joy afford,</L>
<L>That eas'd the cares of Rome's Imperial Lord,</L>
<L>Who in her satire frolicksome and wild,</L>
<L>Gave vice the deepest wounds when most she smil'd.</L>

<P>His Lordship would make me bumper it last night, roasting such bundles of his fine girls; 'pon my soul I and Torrendel knock'd the bot∣tle about rarely. How his Lordship stared at dinner when I hob nob'd him; says he, my dear Dickins, are you in earnest? 'pon my soul, said I, my dear Torrendel I am, that's poz.

<SPEAKER>Dick. (rising)</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you don't know how to behave as a parlour visitor to me, as a customer, walk into my shop, and wait there till you are serv'd. Here, John, take this person's orders. Weigh tobacco! as you are
<PB N="3" REF="6"/><HI>now</HI> Sir Hans Burgess, I may yet be Sir An∣thony Dickens; I may be knighted for bring∣ing up an address. You made your money by a contract of hats, and an't I making mine by—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your country merchant shop of all sorts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>My banking-house, agencies, receiver∣ships, factorships—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And coal-ships. Now <HI>I</HI> have laid out my money in buying a scope of land, and my grand hobby is to turn it into a fashionable sea∣bathing place. I have such a liberal mind to accommodate the publick, I built first there a beautiful house—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>For yourself. As my Lord says, to serve a man's self, has been long the way of doing things for the public good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I raised as pretty an hotel! and the neat row of lodging-houses!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to give it a name, you must get a few of us people of fashion down to it. Suppose I say to his Lordship, 'pon my soul Torrendel, now you should take a house from my friend, Sir Hans, he's a good, honest, stupid sort of a soul—why then, says my Lord, nay my dear Dickens, you are too severe. Yes, perhaps I may prevail on Torrendel to take one of your new houses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so much good in you, hem! a pity, friend Dickens, my Lord can't admit you for an hour to his table, but it makes you so cursed saucy.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proud! a proof my Lord ca'n't do without me.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are so clever that I will trust you, because I ca'n't do without you.</P>

<P>Very civil, <STAGE>(<HI>bows</HI>)</STAGE> as my Lud says; then says I, oh, dem it my Lud—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Devils in you, and the Lud; I came to consult you. You know I design to bestow my ward Augusta Woodbine, with her whole fortune, on my son George; but I fear the re∣port of her riches will bring all your flashy, high-titled gentry about her, then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! then, indeed, she may be for despising a son of yours. As my Lud was fil∣ling his glass, my jogging his elbow, dem it, Dickens, said he, you are sull of mischief.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Devil's in your twenty years back! how to bring my son's marriage about now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make your ward think that her uncle has made a second will, and that she's not worth two-pence, then she'll be glad to snap at your George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! I expect her to-day from Lon∣don. According to that plan, it will shew too much attention to go myself to meet her—I'll let her down—I'll send any body—will you go, my dear fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Civil again; <STAGE>(bows)</STAGE> its a doubt to me, if you know how to make a bow, Sir Hans, ha, ha, ha! this morning I, making my bow of leave to his Ludship, sliding back, stumbled upon the poor Chaplain's toe; my Lud laughed!
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>Zounds! cries his Reverence, you've killed me! Huzza, says my Lud, then the parson's dead, and has lost his living, ha, ha, ha! Oh, but to meet this Lady I'll send my daughter Fanny. Here she is.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must not take her from her accom∣plishments—I'll go, and in my way drop this parcel at my Lud's, a trivial thing, but was I to send it, it would be, <Q>Eh, now, Dickens, why didn't you come yourself, my dear fel∣low? always happy to see you.</Q> Must call, my Lord may think I'm getring proud, pride is so contemptible.</P>

<P>Sir, by the mouth of a parent she receives admonition from Heaven itself; and when he commits that charge to another, it is indeed sacred. The care of youth is an ardu∣ous, and delicate trust of confidence, and honor; I look upon truth, cleanliness, and frugality, to be the first principles in a lady's education. They preserve to her mind, person, and means, purity, health, and independence of obligation, which thro' the devious paths of her future life, to the unsuspecting female, is often the con∣cealed adder, for the destruction of her in∣nocence.</P>

<P>It is! I wish my Lord hadn't part∣ed with it! the castle and its delightful envi∣rons were the tranquil scenes of my most happy hours! after marriage our first years were pass'd here, and tho' there was title on his side, and great wealth on mine, yet ours was not a match of fashion! neither ambition on my part, or (I think) avarice on his; very young to be sure,
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>but then I was a little philosopher, tho' bred in the full brilliant certainty of every dazzling joy that riches cou'd bestow, yet my sight was proof against the glare of splendor. My Lord was gay, accomplish'd, and the generosity of a youthful mind repell'd all idea of advantage in our union.</P>

<P>Why, sir, but for the charity of Mr. George Burgess we should be worse. He has unpeopled our island tho', and settled them com∣fortably near his father's. Since Lord Torren∣del, our landlord, leaves us to his Frenchman and that Master Dickins, I wish they'd take the house off my hands.</P>

<PB N="92" REF="95"/>my resentment! my deserved, and bitter re∣proach! grief cannot reach a breast so callous as yours! it is only the stings of a wounded pride, and disappointed purpose, that now agitates you; reflect! return an humble gratitude to heaven for having made my unexpected arrival here the means of snatching you from the repetition of a crime the most hostile to society. A selfish, transient gratification, that must banish for ever an unhappy female from the paths of honor! shun'd thro' life by the best part of her own sex! —and even despised by you! the author of her shame! your wrongs to me are nothing, but your meditated shifts, tricks, and plans, which you call gallantries, reflect only a disgrace on the dignity of manhood!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Tor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, your conduct renders you rather an object of pity, than resentment—you have implicitly delivered up your fortune, your character, nay more, my lord, your honor, to be the sport and property of an infamous parasite— your confidential savourite, your French Valet, has counteracted the rectitude of your intentions, by embezzelling the sums he had for purposes dictated by duty and nature. O! why will those who possess the godlike power of doing good, delegate a base, unworthy agent, for the kind purposes of soft humanity.</P>
