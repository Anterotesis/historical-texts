<P>Pretty! say elegant, my dear papa—Show me such another orchestra for a private concert—You have seen Drury-Lane, at an Oratorio.</P>

<P>Not I child.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>

<P>Yes, I have, for I stopp'd upwards of two mi∣nutes the other day, in Lincolns-Inn-fields, listening to the man playing on the little sticks.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Orpheus defend me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like a good song, or a good tune upon the fid∣dle—But at your confounded concerts, as you call them, they set up such a roaring, scraping and piping, that confound me if I can hear one for the noise of the other.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll be inspired with such a Gusto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good song and a bottle that's my Gusto. I am an Englishman, Cecilia. I like an English song, and I'd rather hear the simple nervous strains of an honest Tar, in praise of a Rodney, a Hood, or a Howe, than all the squallini concerts in Italy. O! girl if you was but to hear a song at our Club.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I want to speak to you, upon a more serious subject—I am informed, you have an acquaint∣ance with Mr. Bouquet, a Hop Merchant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hop Merchant Sir! there's not a finer gentleman about Town than Mr. Bouquet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough, I never saw him, but my old friend Vinegar the Wine Merchant, tells me, there is not a greater coxcomb about town, than this Mr. Bou∣quet. His father was a Frenchman I'm told, he's a fop by inheritance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish Mr. Vinegar would mind his own affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he does, so he does child—He has aquired a noble fortune by the importation of Port and Madeira.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Making Port and Madeira, you mean sir, he's an officious, impertinent, busy, meddling, old mischief-maker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's my friend, child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, your child's enemy can never be your friend —Mr. Vinegar, talk of Mr. Bouquet—Mr. Vinegar is a mechanic, but Mr. Bouquet, is a gentleman and scorns to do any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time enough for him to commence gentleman, when he has gathered the plum from the tree of industry —'Tis then a man enjoys the fruits of his labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sir, and by the time this plum is ripe, he with∣out a tooth, will be obliged to mumble like old Vinegar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>She loves him, I see that <STAGE>(<HI>aside.</HI>)</STAGE> Harkee Child, take my word for it, Bouquet will never be worth the kernel of a damason. I am told it is nothing with him but Ranelaughs, Pantheons and Operas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I like him the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cram.</SPEAKER>
<P>To day, I am told, away rattling in his vis-a-vis, like a Venetion Ambassador.—Tomorrow, perch'd up in a high Phaeton, peeping into the people's garret windows—Now in his powdered gown, like a French Barber; and then you see him sliding down the Mall, in a pye bald coat—Buckles from the shew-glass, in Ex∣eter-change, and the face of a waiting maid, under the hat of a Russian trooper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, sir, Mr. Vinegar's outre description is a most monstrous Caricatura. He judges of a gentle∣man, with his narrow ruffles, and twelve gray hairs tied up in a bassa bag.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>You love this Bouquet then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do sir, I frankly own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Child, I like your candour. You shall go with me into the country child, and I warrant there the beautiful revolutions of the seasons, will crase him from your heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! dear papa, never, never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cecilia I tell you this, I love you as a parent ought, and therefore I never will approve of Mr. Bou∣quet's addresses, till he forsakes fashion and foppery, and returns to his hop-yards in kent, and his counting house in St Mary Aix.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed papa, you are extremely cruel to me, my soul is never possessed of the lov'd idea of my sweet Bou∣quet, that you don't sour my temper with old Vinegar; and when I sondly imagine every obstacle to my hap∣piness removed, you throw a hop packet in my way, and cut off my darling hope, with an odious simmery aix.</P>

<P>You know child, I mean it all for—</P>
