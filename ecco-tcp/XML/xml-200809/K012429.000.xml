<L>When glist'ring Spangles deck the Robe of Night,</L>
<L>And all their Kine in Pens avoid the Cold,</L>
<L>The buxom Troops, still eager of Delight,</L>
<L>Round <HI>Damon</HI>'s Eyne a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Linen Cloth.</NOTE> Drapet white infold,</L>
<L>He darkling gropes 'till he some one can hold.</L>
<L>Next <HI>Corin</HI> hides his Head, and must impart</L>
<L>What wanton fair One smote his Hand so bold.</L>
<L>He <HI>Delia</HI> names, nor did from Truth depart;</L>
<L>For well he knew her Touch, who long had fir'd his Heart.</L>

<L>Stay I conjure you by your Hopes of Bliss,</L>
<L>Trust not, my <HI>Daphne,</HI> the rough-biting Air,</L>
<L>Let not rude Winds those Lips of Softness kiss,</L>
<L>Will <HI>Eurus</HI> stern, the Charms of Beauty spare?</L>
<L>No, he will hurt my rosy-featur'd Fair,</L>
<L>If aught so bright dares rugged <HI>Carl</HI> invade,</L>
<L>Too tender thou such rough assaults to bear;</L>
<L>The Mountain Ash may stand tho' strip'd of Shade,</L>
<L>But at the slightest Wound the silken Flow'r will fade.</L>
