<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THIS night with dread unusual we appear,</L>
<L>(For this has been a very damning year)</L>
<L>Establish'd fame perhaps in vain we bring,</L>
<L>Since rigid justice is an awful thing,</L>
<L>Awful and hateful, human but in part,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>All frown, an outside man, without a heart.</L>
<L>Such you may see in every street you pass,</L>
<L>Just as like men, in plaister, stone, or brass.</L>
<L>Our early Prologues in less cautious times,</L>
<L>Rail'd at the audience in permitted rhymes,<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Faults there might be, they own'd, but then wou'd swear,</L>
<L>Of faults or beauties, you no judges were.</L>
<L>As peers, by brother peers alone are tried,</L>
<L>Poets alone, on poets shou'd decide.</L>
<L>With surly Ben this dogma first began,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>So in succession to pert Colley ran.</L>
<L>John Dryden, with a crab stick of harsh wit,</L>
<L>Rejoiced to drub the Hydra of the pit.</L>
<L>Tho' little then was right, and much amiss,</L>
<L>Not one of all the venom'd tongues durst hiss.<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>On the tamed spirit of the cudgel'd town,</L>
<L>Almanzor and mad Maximin went down.</L>
<L>Now, by inversion ten times more polite,</L>
<L>The poet's always wrong, the critic right.</L>
<L>Nay, some have found a more enlighten'd way,<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>And boldly censure who ne'er saw the play.</L>
<L>This mayn't perhaps be justice to the letter,</L>
<L>To see is well, but inspiration's better.</L>
<L>Of old, the vehicles of wit were scarce,</L>
<L>Men judged upon the spot of play or farce.<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>By no concocted spite the piece was torn,</L>
<L>The short lived Virus died where it was born.</L>
<L>No daily column then was gladly seen,</L>
<L>By envy raised, and scribled o'er by spleen.</L>
<L>And sure if pleas'd or griev'd, we little gain,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>By reasoning back the pleasure or the pain.</L>
<L>Still safely we may trust the feeling part,</L>
<L>But never set the head against the heart.</L>
<L>For various causes you frequent the scene,</L>
<L>Some to dispel, but more to indulge the spleen.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Some fly a dun, and some a railing wise,</L>
<L>And lose the real, in fictitious life.</L>
<L>A passive mistress many here pursue,</L>
<L>But most we see have nothing else to do.</L>
<L>Others prefer, the days dull business done,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>To yawn in company than quite alone.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>Good harmless souls! may no rude sounds molest 'em</L>
<L>Nor passions, feign'd or real e'er infest 'em!</L>
<L>In times not long gone by, a noble peer,</L>
<L>(Unlike the sprightly race who now trip here)<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Four previous footmen his high state express,</L>
<L>And gorgeous as a satrap was his dress.</L>
<L>No household fowl on maple perch repos'd,</L>
<L>As innocent of thought, more sweetly dozed.</L>
<L>Warm in his muff, with periwig for cap,<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>Here he indulged one discontinuous nap.</L>
<L>Yates, Woodward, Cibber, Garrick charm'd in vain,</L>
<L>Kind Morpheus held him in his softer chain.</L>
<L>Just as the curtain drop'd, he heard it said,</L>
<L>A well known slentor of the stage was dead.<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>"I'm glad on't (cries my lord) and why do you think?</L>
<L>"He roar'd so loud, I cou'd not sleep one wink."</L>
<L>This night at times may kinder slumbers seize you,</L>
<L>Sleep when we're dull, and wake when we can please you.</L>

<L>THO' he pretends no commerce with the skies,</L>
<L>A perfect stranger to deep mysteries,</L>
<L>Nor is astrologer enough to make</L>
<L>Predictions for a new year's Almanack,</L>
<L>Yet for his play, the poet sees with sorrow,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>And now foretells, what all may see to-morrow.</L>
<L>Tho' here, where genuine sense with candour reigns</L>
<L>Fair approbation crown his tragic strains,</L>
<L>(For oft this favour'd muse has been before you,</L>
<L>Always to thank, but never to implore you)<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>A hundred sterner critics still remain,</L>
<L>To damn his labours, and your taste arraign.</L>
<L>In posts, gazettes, and chronicles they rage,</L>
<L>And failing to adorn, affright the stage.</L>
<L>Turn to the usual column, there you'll see,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>What those sage Delphic oracles decree.</L>
<L>First for the fable; "that's a flimzy tale,</L>
<L>"With unsupported characters, dull, stale,</L>
<L>"Not one generic, or original.</L>
<L>"The situations want dramatic art,<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>"Such feeble patho's ne'er can touch the heart.</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>"Next plainly does the plagiary appear,</L>
<L>"This, <HI>Ha!</HI> is Richard, and that <HI>Oh!</HI> is Lear,</L>
<L>The <HI>Pshaws,</HI> and <HI>Tuts</HI> are Shakspeare, Shakspeare clear.</L>
<L>Yet why this rage to damn? the thief on shore <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Who eyes the labouring bark, when tempests roar,</L>
<L>And prays, that rocks the vessel's ribs may break,</L>
<L>Means his own gain in plundering the wreck.</L>
<L>But tho' a thousand foundering poets split,</L>
<L>None thrive, and some must lose by shipwreck'd wit.<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Who steals your fame, as Shakspeare said of yore,</L>
<L>Enriches not himself but makes you poor.</L>
<L>The Tartar, when his comely foe lies slain,</L>
<L>Hopes with his spoils, his qualities to gain.</L>
<L>Cou'd critics every excellence destroy,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>They nought inherit, but the barbarous joy.</L>
<L>Then of all censors, none are so severe</L>
<L>As those, whose scenes have been exploded here.</L>
<L>Self rais'd to the tribunal seat of letters,</L>
<L>As rogues made justices, they try their betters.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Unlike the Carthage queen, the ills they bore</L>
<L>But indurate their callous bosoms more.</L>
<L>Shou'd some pert teacher, his own worth to enhance</L>
<L>Decry all rival brothers of the dance,</L>
<L>Swear, one was aukward, t'other's manner coarse,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>Another hobbled like a founder'd horse,</L>
<L>Say wou'd you not the envious railer blame,</L>
<L>When once you knew, Coupee himself was lame?</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>Some merry idlers to the pen resort,</L>
<L>And free from malice, write at us in sport,<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Like the poor pelted frogs we cry out thus,</L>
<L>"Alas 'tis play to you, but death to us."</L>
<L>Yet shou'd some genuine critic point a fault,</L>
<L>Our author's not too forward to be taught,</L>
<L>To sage good counsel thankful he'll attend,<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>And think who spares him least, is most his friend.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Annius.</SPEAKER>
<L>None but one,</L>

<L>Soften'd almost to tears the gracious prince</L>

<SPEAKER>Cornelia.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then what remains for me. I vainly hoped</L>

<L>Appears to my weak judgment, let me own,</L>
<L>Like filling of the pail, to kick it down.<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Nor less absurd than if some beauteous queen</L>
<L>With mantle flowing and majestic mein,</L>
<L>More admiration of her charms to gain</L>
<L>Shou'd chuse a Monkey to bear up her train.</L>
<L>Pray tell would Handel's oratorio's please</L>
<L>If clos'd with <HI>Bobbin Joan,</HI> or <HI>Butter'd Peas?</HI></L>
<L>Yet since the tyrant custom bids us try,</L>
<L>To make you laugh, whom we before made cry,</L>
<L>I wish with all my heart our Proteus poet</L>
<L>Had rhym'd me something merry that would do it.<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L><PB REF="92"/>No matter what, of homely Gills, or Jacks,</L>
<L>Or Beaux with spider legs, and lizard backs.</L>
<L>How the bold spirit of the modern dame</L>
<L>Throned in her car, drives the high road to fame,</L>
<L>While more delight the labour can afford,</L>
<L>To rule four coursers, than obey one lord.</L>
<L>Behold, incumbent o'er her ponies backs,</L>
<L>The sounding lash our female Jehu smacks,</L>
<L>Thro' her small fingers plys her skilful reins,</L>
<L>And cheers the nags with hoarse equestrian strains.<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>"Gee Rainbow, Peacock, Button, gee along</L>
<L>Then squares her elbows, and confounds the throng</L>
<L>While her soft bosom too robustly feels,</L>
<L>A man like glory from her kindling wheels.</L>
<L>At these perhaps you have sometimes laugh'd before,</L>
<L>Yet faith I wish you'd laugh at them once more.</L>
<L>I'd do my best to oblige you, as I live,</L>
<L>Then in return for once to oblige me strive.</L>
<L>Nor now to modern France can we resort,</L>
<L>Murder and crimes make melancholy sport.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Once, 'twas a happy land for all conditions,</L>
<L>Now, all is assignats and requisitions</L>
<L>Nor does the war with Holland promise much,</L>
<L>For who e'er brought home fancy from the Dutch?</L>
<L>Pepper and cheese they had, let us not wrong 'em,</L>
<L>But scarce one sprig of bays e'er grew among 'em.</L>
<L><PB REF="93"/>The use of language as most travellers tell</L>
<L>They think, was only given to buy and sell,</L>
<L>And when three weighty words, the price is spoke,</L>
<L>Mynheer sinks down again to mum and smoke.<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>But now 'tis time to drop the mimic art,</L>
<L>And breathe one wish that swells each honest heart.</L>
<L>May Britain's son's with victory by their side</L>
<L>Make Holland shake, and humble Gallia's pride</L>
<L>The God of battle thro' all dangers guard 'em,</L>
<L>And their best meed, a Nation's thanks reward 'em!</L>
