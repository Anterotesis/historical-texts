<L>AROUND th' enduring martyr's hallow'd shrine</L>
<L>Their brightest flowers the holy Muses twine!</L>
<L>With roses blushing from the fields of war,</L>
<L>Their skilful hands adorn the victor's car!</L>
<L>And, for the candid brow of peace, they bring</L>
<L>The modest honours of the early spring!</L>
<L>But for the peace that lifts th' imploring eye,</L>
<L>From whose frail breast escapes the coward's sigh,</L>
<L>No muse applauding one small leaf shall bring</L>
<L>Of all the foliage of the early spring;</L>
<L>But, from her bow'r, shall Ignominy rend</L>
<L>A branch of nightshade for her <HI>gentle</HI> friend!</L>

<L>THESE painful eyes behold an English Peer</L>
<L>(His weak Memorial sicklied o'er with fear,)</L>
<L>In humble attitude a suppliant stand,</L>
<L>To claim the friendship of a murd'rous band!</L>
<L>The plaintive breathings of the snow-wing'd dove</L>
<L>Ill suit the imperial messenger of Jove—</L>
<L>Who should, by long-excited vengeance driv'n,</L>
<L>Bear in his grasp the thunderbolt of heav'n;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH, my lov'd country! time-ennobled realm,</L>
<L>Where jealous honour still has watch'd the helm;</L>
<L>Th' unclouded glory long to Europe known</L>
<L>Which clasps thy loins like a refulgent zone:</L>
<L>Say, will thy hand the hallow'd cestus tear,</L>
<L>And yield thy virtue to the tainting air?</L>
<L>For me—unmark'd by honours, wealth, or fame,</L>
<L>No swelling title blazoning round my name!—</L>
<L>To be a fleeting bubble of thy earth</L>
<L>Inflames my mounting soul with pride of birth!</L>
<L>Oh, sacred parent! still thyself revere;</L>
<L>To honour's call, to virtue's voice, be near:</L>
<L>Blur not the brightness of thy heav'nly cause</L>
<L>With one dim moment's intervening pause.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Better to fall in glory's full career,</L>
<L>Embracing honour on th' untimely bier;</L>
<L>Than weak, subdued, with agonising strife,</L>
<L>Waste (in the socket) the last gleams of life.</L>
<L>Say, if to cloathe with light the laughing skies</L>
<L>The God of Day were doom'd no more to rise,</L>
<L>Were it not better, in the pomp of pow'r,</L>
<L>In the rich ardour of meridian hour,</L>
<L>To rush abrupt from heav'n with downward flight</L>
<L>A flaming chaos to the jaws of night;</L>
<L>Than tinge the ocean with a ling'ring ray,</L>
<L>Expiring in the silence of decay?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET think not France from nature will depart,</L>
<L>And chace the fiend that grapples to her heart;</L>
<L>That the wild tigress will forego her prey,</L>
<L>Couch with the kid, and with the lambkin play;</L>
<L>That the fond child shall stretch his little hand</L>
<L>To lead the lion in a flowr'y band!</L>
<L>These beauteous emblems of the days of old</L>
<L>With this mock concord no resemblance hold:</L>
<L>No heavy drops of mandragora steep</L>
<L>The dragon's eyelids in the dews of sleep!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
The gift extended by a faithless foe</L>
<L>Is the concealment of a lurking woe:</L>
<L>'Tis like the pause that Nature's storm bestows,</L>
<L>An awful calm—the thunder's dread repose!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MY anxious eyes solicit still in vain</L>
<L>Some sign that might my failing hopes sustain;</L>
<L>Some sacred altar, rob'd in spotless white,</L>
<L>Where candour's priest performs the genial rite;</L>
<L>Where long-tried statesmen, fraught with wisdom's lore,</L>
<L>Whose hair the hand of peace hath silver'd o'er,</L>
<L>With learned fathers sway'd by virtue's rule,</L>
<L>Whom peace hath tutor'd in religion's school;</L>
<L>Where, pensive as they walk'd, the holy breeze</L>
<L>Flew through the shady cloister whisp'ring peace.</L>
<L>For these best pledges, other scenes arise—</L>
<L>Th' enchanter's cauldron smites my wond'ring eyes!</L>
<L>Behold a troop of ghastly shapes advance</L>
<L>In frantic mood, and form a horrid dance;</L>
<L>Now bending low, these haggard forms of hell</L>
<L>Breathe the dark pray'r, and mutter the dread spell:</L>
<L>And now into the turbid stream they throw</L>
<L>(With imprecations big with future woe)</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
The galling tears that flow'd from beauty's cheek,</L>
<L>The voice of agony, and terror's shriek,</L>
<L>The blood that trickled from affliction's dart,</L>
<L>The sighs exhaling from a broken heart,</L>
<L>The burst of anguish, murder's piercing cry,</L>
<L>The screams that hurried thro' the midnight sky,</L>
<L>The famish'd infant's deep expiring groan,</L>
<L>The dungeon'd victim's solitary moan,</L>
<L>The clotted hair which desperation tore,</L>
<L>The milk of murder'd mothers streak'd with gore,</L>
<L>The plaint of innocence, the virgin's pray'r</L>
<L>Which the rude ravisher consign'd to air,</L>
<L>The hallow'd edicts by religion plann'd,</L>
<L>And holy wedlock's desecrated band.</L>
<L>Behold the infernal sorcerers unite</L>
<L>To close their incantation's fearful rite,</L>
<L>And leering cast into the vase prosound,</L>
<L>The likeness of two skulls which once were crown'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SAY, for these fiends, if England can descend</L>
<L>To weave the bond that grapples friend to friend,</L>
<L>Flown is the spirit of her living fame;—</L>
