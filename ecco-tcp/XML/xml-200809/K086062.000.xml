<HEAD>CANTO I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ONCE on a time two certain men,</L>
<L>No matter much for where and when;</L>
<L>(Sir Thomas one, plain William t'other,</L>
<L>A second cousin by the mother;</L>
<L>Something between a friend and servant,</L>
<L>Of titles and respects observant;)</L>
<L>Were got in philosophic chat,</L>
<L>Of pro and con, and this and that;</L>
<L>Concerning man, his occupations,</L>
<L>Pursuits and pleasures, plagues and passions:</L>
<L>The first of whom this doctrine vented,</L>
<L>NO MAN WAS EVER YET CONTENTED.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Knight, who held th' affirmative,</L>
<L>If we may babbling Fame believe,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Tho' no great scholar, knew your Greek A,</L>
<L>Alpha, and so forth, to Omega;</L>
<L>Had fables read of beasts and birds,</L>
<L>Some reason spoke, and many words;</L>
<L>Saw cause and consequence combin'd,</L>
<L>And watch'd the emotions of the mind:</L>
<L>Was held, in short, for one of those,</L>
<L>Who know their navel from their nose;</L>
<L>And, tho' he had not read Confucius,</L>
<L>Could feel if pinch'd by old or new shoes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The other, whom we William christen'd,</L>
<L>Spoke much the loudest when he listen'd.</L>
<L>In many cases men of sense</L>
<L>Know silence is good eloquence;</L>
<L>And he who means to keep his patron,</L>
<L>Must unmolested let him chatter on;</L>
<L>Must patient sit, and hear his quoth-ing,</L>
<L>And get prefer'd for saying nothing.</L>
<L>For your dependant, like your pointer,</L>
<L>Should neither tongue nor limb nor joint stir,</L>
<L>But, all attentive, crouch and watch,</L>
<L>Obedient ev'ry signal catch,</L>
<L>'Till you've discharg'd your Wit;—sure token</L>
<L>He then may wag his tail and open.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>William was but a coadjutor,</L>
<L>Sir Thomas was chief prolocutor.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
He, half in earnest, half in jest,</L>
<L>As uppermost ideas prest,</L>
<L>Emotions various could provoke;—</L>
<L>Read how he thought, and what he spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I say, friend William, nay I swear,</L>
<L>The world's not worth a wise man's care;</L>
<L>Not worth, though you hold life a blessing,</L>
<L>Fatigue of dressing and undressing:</L>
<L>Not worth, believe me, honest Will,</L>
<L>The pain of swallowing a pill.</L>
<L>Nay, life is, and I think the figure</L>
<L>Will give my argument some vigor,</L>
<L>A dream of phantasies and lies,</L>
<L>Which no man wakes from till he dies:</L>
<L>Or rather, still to speak profounder,</L>
<L>From which he wakes by sleeping sounder:</L>
<L>A nauseous draught that's never swallow'd,</L>
<L>Or by succeeding potions follow'd,</L>
<L>An everlasting, bitter bolus;</L>
<L>Disguis'd to cheat, or to condole us:</L>
<L>So, William, till you're laid in hearse,</L>
<L>I lie not, tho' I speak in verse,</L>
<L>You'll have some loathsome pois'nous pill,</L>
<L>That shall disgust your palate still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pray, tell me, what's this boasted man,</L>
<L>But some boy's top, or vixen's fan?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
By passion flirted, torn, and hurl'd,</L>
<L>And spun and whipt about the world;</L>
<L>This way and that, now there now here,</L>
<L>Set up and lash'd by Hope and Fear;</L>
<L>For some new gewgaw ever panting,</L>
<L>Enjoying nothing, all things wanting;</L>
<L>Never content with drink and meat,</L>
<L>Sufficient for himself to eat,</L>
<L>But all he can monopolizes,</L>
<L>And picks and culls and gormandizes,</L>
<L>Then wallows in th' exhaustless slough,</L>
<L>Yet ne'er suspects he has enough;</L>
<L>Has something further to desire,</L>
<L>If yeoman now, he'd next be 'Squire;</L>
<L>When 'Squire a Lord, when Lord a King,</L>
<L>When that why he'd be every thing!</L>
<L>Would grasp the globe, and for a socket</L>
<L>Compress and put it in his pocket.</L>
<L>But could he all things thus command,</L>
<L>Chang'd into stone, he'd lifeless stand,</L>
<L>By Vis Inertiae's magic wand.</L>
<L>For only can the Puppet move,</L>
<L>Play'd by the wire of dear self-love;</L>
<L>When It some pleasure would obtain,</L>
<L>Or when 'twould run away from pain.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
They make It caper, simple Fool,</L>
<L>Like elephant at dancing-school;</L>
<L>Pain heats the floor, and flogs like Beadle,</L>
<L>While Madam Pleasure plays the fiddle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shew me the man, or small or great,</L>
<L>With kingdoms, or without estate;</L>
<L>A buyer, seller, loser, winner,</L>
<L>Philosopher, or saint, or sinner,</L>
<L>No matter for his youth or age,</L>
<L>Whether he's simple or he's sage,</L>
<L>Of temp'rate or of torrid region,</L>
<L>Or what his colour or religion;</L>
<L>Shew me the man, throughout the earth,</L>
<L>Who, 'tween his burial and his birth,</L>
<L>Could truly say he did possess</L>
<L>A day of perfect happiness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>William, observe, I mean to prove</L>
<L>Our minds are so dispos'd to rove,</L>
<L>So much is Fancy giv'n to gadding,</L>
<L>For this thing or for that still madding,</L>
<L>Impetuous after some new toy,</L>
<L>She never gives you time t' enjoy</L>
<L>What God and Industry have sent,</L>
<L>But makes your life continual Lent;</L>
<L>So eager is she in pursuit,</L>
<L>She plucks and throws away the fruit;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Or say she should sit still awhile,</L>
<L>For half an hour, or half a mile,</L>
<L>'Tis not her nature to be quiet;</L>
<L>And, so capricious is her diet,</L>
<L>A go-cart child, or woman breeding,</L>
<L>Is not more whimsical in feeding;</L>
<L>Nor can your wheedling, or your flogging,</L>
<L>Keep her consistent in her progging.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth Will, Sir Thomas, how shall I</L>
<L>To such sound arguments reply?</L>
<L>Your oratory is so good,</L>
<L>I think it cannot be withstood;</L>
<L>Yet, something which your Worship said</L>
<L>Started a hint, if 'tis not fled,</L>
<L>Which I'll pursue, under correction,</L>
<L>And not by way of contradiction;</L>
<L>I were an ass to think of that—</L>
<L>Your Worship's words come in so pat,</L>
<L>Your figures fall so very thick,</L>
<L>Like plumbs in pudding, Sir, they stick;</L>
<L>You've such abundant rhetoric</L>
<L>You've learnt by rote all Aristotle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I say then life is like a bottle,</L>
<L>Which, when uncork'd, is full of liquor</L>
<L>That may be emptied slow or quicker,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
In gentle streams, or rude inflations,</L>
<L>Impell'd by soft or boist'rous passions.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This bottle, likewise, may contain</L>
<L>Bad vinegar, or good Champagne;</L>
<L>(That is, to shew the figure fit,</L>
<L>A Misanthrope, or man of wit)</L>
<L>Hungary water, fine and clear,</L>
<L>Or muddy, stale, and flat small-beer;</L>
<L>Your subtile spirits, or your mighty,</L>
<L>Your aqua fortis, aqua vitae;</L>
<L>Your fiery spirits, or your placid,</L>
<L>Your cordial, or corroding acid;</L>
<L>With many more, that I can't think of,</L>
<L>Which men and maids do daily drink of.</L>
<L>Whence I dare undertake to trace</L>
<L>The likeness of all human race—</L>
<L>And, first, there's bawd and brandy face.</L>
<L>Which metaphor more meaning holds</L>
<L>Than the first glance, perhaps, unfolds;</L>
<L>For, I dare say, you'll own, Sir Thomas,</L>
<L>When lust and liquor overcome us,</L>
<L>Tho' sweet to taste as barley-sugar,</L>
<L>When slily ta'en in hugger-mugger,</L>
<L>Alike the brandy and the bawd,</L>
<L>Will man of health and fame defraud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<L>Hold, hold, friend William, said the Knight,</L>
<L>Pull up your horse, and take me right:</L>
<L>Tho' drunkenness and fornication</L>
<L>Are vices, past all disputation,</L>
<L>Which, when indulg'd, deserve recision;</L>
<L>Yet, with Morality's permission,</L>
<L>I sometimes love my thirst to quench,</L>
<L>And, sure, I love a pretty wench!</L>
<L>Better by far that niggard Fate</L>
<L>Should man at once annihilate,</L>
<L>And out of Nature's reg'ment drum us,</L>
<L>Than take that first of pleasures from us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall I, when the kind turtle's willing,</L>
<L>Forego the dear delight of billing?</L>
<L>When on my breast her head reclines,</L>
<L>And while my eager arm entwines</L>
<L>Around her slender yielding waist,</L>
<L>Then, when embracing, and embrac'd;</L>
<L>When I behold, impatient grown,</L>
<L>Her swelling bosom up and down</L>
<L>Impassion'd heave, and pant, and sigh,</L>
<L>Then, when ten thousand transports lie</L>
<L>Within her half-clos'd liquid eye;</L>
<L>Of pleasure then shall I be flam'd?</L>
<L>No, if I am, may I be d—d.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
In such a dear, delightful season,</L>
<L>Shall I ask leave of madam Reason?</L>
<L>A prim, precise, fanatic prude,</L>
<L>That bawls out rape if you are rude;</L>
<L>That cants and whines, and prays and preaches,</L>
<L>And hates both petticoats and breeches;</L>
<L>That, with respect to loco-motions,</L>
<L>Has such affected, queasy notions,</L>
<L>Tho' mother Church should grant commission,</L>
<L>She'd turn her nose up at co-t—n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For my part, I must freely own,</L>
<L>So much have I the flesh and bone</L>
<L>Of father Adam in me cas'd,</L>
<L>When th' apple's offer'd I must taste;</L>
<L>And 'tis, indeed, my firm opinion</L>
<L>You'd do the very same, my minion.</L>
<L>For as for Joseph, whom the Jews</L>
<L>Pretend th' Egyptian did refuse,</L>
<L>I place it to the lies o' th' nation,</L>
<L>Or else an error in translation;</L>
<L>Because, if you will please to look</L>
<L>In Matthew, Chronicles, or Luke,</L>
<L>You'll find, without much pains or pother,</L>
<L>How fast these Jews begat each other:</L>
<L>And howsoe'er 't may be revil'd,</L>
<L>There's but one way to get a child.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
The seventh and tenth of Nehemiah</L>
<L>Will, likewise, prove that man a liar</L>
<L>Who should pretend that th' Israelites</L>
<L>Forbore to celebrate Love's rites;</L>
<L>And Solomon, in all his glory,</L>
<L>Took vast delight in rory tory;</L>
<L>On which he made so sweet a song,</L>
<L>A man might sing it all day long.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again, friend William, know we not,</L>
<L>How sons and daughters were begot</L>
<L>By Isaac, Abraham, and Lot?</L>
<L>And, <HI>cntre nous,</HI> if I may hint</L>
<L>What may be each day read in print,</L>
<L>'Twas sometimes done, to make it snugger,</L>
<L>In your said way of hugger mugger;</L>
<L>For brother, sister, father, daughter,</L>
<L>Would eat a cherry, if chops did water.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It was by this kind of homogeny</L>
<L>King Priam had so vast a progeny;</L>
<L>And have not all succeeding ages</L>
<L>Follow'd th' example of these sages?</L>
<L>In short, the business must be done,</L>
<L>Or how should father come by son?</L>
<L>And, since it can't be done by proxy,</L>
<L>Duke must have Dutchess, or a doxy.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Were these things held in persecution,</L>
<L>'Twould overturn the Constitution;</L>
<L>For how can he be call'd a free man</L>
<L>Who's not allow'd to have a leman?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>William, who found he'ad trod o' th' corns</L>
<L>Of Letchery, drew in his horns;</L>
<L>And, while Sir Thomas gave the rein,</L>
<L>Wholly salacious, half profane,</L>
<L>To this his twittle twattle vein,</L>
<L>Knowing his humour to a hair,</L>
<L>Friend William took a different air▪</L>
<L>And often simper'd at the joke</L>
<L>Ere it was understood, or spoke:</L>
<L>And, for he knew 'twould please the Knight,</L>
<L>At certain places laugh'd outright;</L>
<L>Then, when the orator had spun</L>
<L>His wit, as far as it would run,</L>
<L>Reply'd, in recantation quaint,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I don't pretend, Sir, I'm a saint.</L>
<L>No, if you did, rejoin'd the Knight,</L>
<L>You'd be a scoundrel hypocrite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor are there many people fonder</L>
<L>Than I, said Will, of <HI>double entendre;</HI></L>
<L>Provided it be done quite clean,</L>
<L>And fools can't find out what you mean.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Your Worship has that happy knack;</L>
<L>You're decent, yet retain a smack—</L>
<L>You slily draw some odd allusion,</L>
<L>Yet look as grave as a Carthusian.</L>
<L>And then each hint so clean convey'd is,</L>
<L>You're quite a fav'rite with the ladies:</L>
<L>They always love a merry man,</L>
<L>Who makes them laugh behind their fan.</L>
<L>Those whom your implications hit,</L>
<L>Forgive the sin for sake o' th' wit;</L>
<L>Nor ever dream of rods in pickle,</L>
<L>When metaphors their fancies tickle</L>
<L>Concerning things which all folks dote on,</L>
<L>But yet which can't be spoke, or wrote on,</L>
<L>Except it be the way you wote on.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Will thought proper thus to knuckle,</L>
<L>The Knight, forthwith, began to chuckle;</L>
<L>It put him in a merry mood,</L>
<L>To find his wit was understood:</L>
<L>Then strait, with jocund heart and phrase,</L>
<L>Retorted back friend William's praise.</L>
<L>For, though he wanted not for sense,</L>
<L>He, like his neighbours, could dispense</L>
<L>With all the flattery folks could spare,</L>
<L>And more, indeed, than was his snare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
<L>I've often said, both here and hence,</L>
<L>Cousin, you've more than common sense;</L>
<L>Tho' faith, I cannot chuse but smile,</L>
<L>And well I may, to think that while</L>
<L>After Miss Tickle-tail we ran,</L>
<L>The theme on which we first began</L>
<L>Is so far lost, in this digression</L>
<L>We must snuff hard to scent the question.</L>
<L>Howe'er, I'm glad our evagation,</L>
<L>With these free hints on fecundation,</L>
<L>Are but by way of conversation.</L>
<L>For, were they meant t' appear in print,</L>
<L>Tho' I, instead of flesh, were stint,</L>
<L>I would not feel the goose-quill rod,</L>
<L>No, not for fifty pounds by—.</L>
<L>Which Critic would remorseless thwack,</L>
<L>With iteration, on my back.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True, Will replied; but here you know, Sir,</L>
<L>These slips for little or nothing go, Sir;</L>
<L>The present error's this—your bent</L>
<L>Has overturn'd your argument:</L>
<L>You've prov'd, at least while veins are sappy,</L>
<L>We're very often very happy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thanks for the hint, return'd the Knight—</L>
<L>Instead of wrong, I find I'm right;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
I've no digression made, my friend,</L>
<L>For now most firmly I contend,</L>
<L>It to the argument rejoin'd is,</L>
<L>Because, I find, the case in point is;</L>
<L>And, though my fancy, overheated,</L>
<L>This as a solid blessing treated,</L>
<L>A very little recollection</L>
<L>Will shew us all its imperfection.</L>
<L>Thus—what we call the greatest pleasure,</L>
<L>And value so above all measure,</L>
<L>So small a portion of our time</L>
<L>Employs, when even in our prime,</L>
<L>And makes one look so foolish after,</L>
<L>Fit subject or of scorn or laughter;</L>
<L>'Twould puzzle a Grecian orator</L>
<L>To prove it worthy living for.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or, should you urge, more than in doing,</L>
<L>The pleasure lies in the pursuing,</L>
<L>This, I aver, doth most provoke us,</L>
<L>Because it's all meer hocus pocus.</L>
<L>Delights may twinkle in your eye,</L>
<L>Num'rous as candles in the sky;</L>
<L>(Which, your Astronomers do hold,</L>
<L>Strange as it seems, may all be told)</L>
<L>But people find, whene'er they marry,</L>
<L>Their Hymen's heav'n not half so starry.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Ma'am Venus, ever in mutation,</L>
<L>Gives most light at her elongation;</L>
<L>Our Venus too, without a scoff,</L>
<L>Shines brightest when she's farthest off;</L>
<L>For Bel a wife, and Bel a maid,</L>
<L>Are opposite as light and shade.</L>
<L>Your women, when in hopes of wivery,</L>
<L>Appear as they were carv'd of ivory;</L>
<L>And, though we see they carry noses,</L>
<L>They surely smell to nought but roses;</L>
<L>But, when unloos'd the virgin zone is,</L>
<L>Your alabaster flesh and bone is:</L>
<L>Your maid of snow, some short time a'ter,</L>
<L>Melts into frothy muddy water.</L>
<L>Will, who the Knight's warm temper knew,</L>
<L>Look'd as he thought the satire true;</L>
<L>But heard, like Disputant o'erthrown,</L>
<L>His arguments, and b'liev'd his own.</L>
<L>Suppos'd the cap might fit a slattern,</L>
<L>But was no universal pattern;</L>
<L>For, from most women he survey'd,</L>
<L>Whether a widow, wife, or maid,</L>
<L>He deem'd their wit, and form, and features,</L>
<L>Had made them most bewitching creatures.</L>

<HEAD>CANTO II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>QUOTH William, Sir, the question rests</L>
<L>Concerning human happiness;</L>
<L>The which I think you would deny</L>
<L>That it exists—I don't know why—</L>
<L>Especially when I reflect</L>
<L>On all the riches, and respect,</L>
<L>The parks, the tenements, and manors,</L>
<L>The titles, ancestry, and honours,</L>
<L>With every other worldly blessing,</L>
<L>All which I see you, Sir, possessing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pshaw, William, you're a simple tony,</L>
<L>Because you're poor, you think that money</L>
<L>Will exorcise each human evil,</L>
<L>And send it packing to the Devil;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
That nothing could excite your cares,</L>
<L>But want, or sickness, or grey hairs:</L>
<L>You'll find, friend William, to your cost,</L>
<L>You've reckon'd here without your host.</L>
<L>You little know the freaks and fancies,</L>
<L>The ups and downs, and pranks and prances</L>
<L>Of Miss Imagination's mare,</L>
<L>When frisking forth to take the air:</L>
<L>Not troops of witches, or of fairies,</L>
<L>Sailing to sup on dead man's gizzard,</L>
<L>With Lapland or Norwegian wizard,</L>
<L>On broom-sticks e'er had such vagaries;</L>
<L>Or winc'd and winnied, cut and caper'd,</L>
<L>Half like this Lady, when she's vapor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This, William, as you may divine,</L>
<L>Is no discovery of mine;</L>
<L>'Tis known in every king's dominion,</L>
<L>That happiness is but opinion;</L>
<L>But since the subject has been started,</L>
<L>Somewhat, perhaps, may be imparted,</L>
<L>Tho' we in whifflng squalls do sail,</L>
<L>Of whim, or humour, wit, or tale,</L>
<L>Of satire, argument, or pathos,</L>
<L>Shall steer us clear of quicksand bathos.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>T' exemplify what I assert,</L>
<L>Once more to Fancy we'll revert;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
To Fancy, that capricious Goddess,</L>
<L>Who plays such pranks with human bodies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You've read, no doubt, for who has not?</L>
<L>Who reads not Pope? Or has forgot,</L>
<L>She once suppos'd herself a pot?</L>
<L>(In which a Lady made her tea,</L>
<L>Or slily kept her ratafia)</L>
<L>This arm a kimbo, that stretch'd out,</L>

<L>Lest she, in action of ablution,</L>
<L>Should suffer total dissolution;</L>

<L>Were mortal in that fragile state.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another time, as authors tell ye,</L>
<L>She call'd herself a currant jelly;</L>
<L>And squatted, crouching, quivering, quaking,</L>

<L>When haunch of ven'son chanc'd to meet her,</L>
<L>No hungry Alderman might eat her.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A third strange whimwham, pray Sir note,</L>
<L>She once crept down a cobler's throat,</L>
<L>And there the curst, fantastic vixen</L>
<L>The simple fellow play'd her tricks on;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Swearing, in phrases most unhallow'd,</L>
<L>Poor Crispin had his lapstone swallow'd;</L>
<L>And press'd so hard upon his liver,</L>
<L>And took such oaths, good God forgive her,</L>
<L>And told such lies, all to convince</L>
<L>The brain of our distemper'd prince;</L>
<L>That, had he been or Turk or Jew,</L>
<L>He must have thought the thing were true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another time, as I've heard say,</L>
<L>She swore she was a truss of hay,</L>
<L>And told, in wailings and alasses,</L>
<L>How she was prey'd upon by asses;</L>
<L>Tho' here, some add, this piece of fun,</L>
<L>Was but contriv'd for sake o'th' pun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But I despair to think of half</L>
<L>The tricks she acts to make you laugh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes she mounts into the head</L>
<L>Of some poor wretch, before half mad;</L>
<L>There his weak intellect abuses,</L>
<L>And swears, by G—, she's one o'th' Muses;</L>
<L>And, tho' before he did not know it,</L>
<L>Himself is, out of doubt, a poet.</L>
<L>Then you shall see him stamp and stare,</L>
<L>And look as wise as Moss's mare,</L>
<L>And beat his brow, and curse his fate,</L>
<L>And rub his eyes, and scratch his pate,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="22"/>
And beg and pray his Polyhymnia,</L>
<L>To please to grant a rhyme to chimney;</L>
<L>Then strait unbuttons he his doublet,</L>
<L>To hammer out unmeaning couplet;</L>
<L>About it and about it lingers,</L>
<L>And counts his feet upon his fingers;</L>
<L>But tho' his thoughts run music-ally,</L>
<L>He cannot somehow make 'em tally;</L>
<L>Tho' fifty Loves and Doves are there,</L>
<L>Not any two of them will pair.</L>
<L>He studies, dozes, twirls his thumbs,</L>
<L>And when, at last, the butter comes,</L>
<L>Enraptur'd at the lucky hit,</L>
<L>And all amaz'd at his own wit,</L>
<L>Without the help of toe or tarsus,</L>
<L>He's at the top of Mount Parnassus.</L>
<L>Thus, whilst this most insiduous jade</L>
<L>The simple fellow would persuade</L>
<L>That he's the only man i' th' moon,</L>
<L>And all the world shall know it soon;</L>
<L>That she'll provide him better forage,</L>
<L>And give him plumbs to put in's porridge;</L>
<L>Likewise, or else it shall be curst hard,</L>
<L>Will send him mutton to his mustard;</L>
<L>That woodcock, ortolan, and chicken</L>
<L>Are ready roasted for his picking;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Thus, while he waddles up Fame's ladder,</L>
<L>As empty and as big as bladder,</L>
<L>Inflated and possess'd by legion,</L>
<L>And thinks he soon shall reach the region,</L>
<L>Where he'll p-ss down, while they adore him,</L>
<L>On all that ever went before him,</L>
<L>Instead of finding he's more glorious</L>
<L>Than Bantam King, of fame notorious;</L>
<L>The d—d, insidious, sly suborner</L>
<L>Hath pill'ried him in poet's corner.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes the wicked hussey steals</L>
<L>Into the head, or rather heels,</L>
<L>Of a dull cit, or weak patrician,</L>
<L>And, lo! behold a politician!</L>
<L>See how he runs about the town,</L>

<L>Then wipes his eyes, and eke his nose,</L>

<LG>
<L>NOW let us once again proceed,</L>
<L>With Madam Fancy, and her breed</L>
<L>Of airy visions in the brain:</L>
<L>But this much let me first explain;</L>
<L>I can't perhaps at all times stay</L>
<L>The application to convey,</L>
<L>If with the subject I should wax warm.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take this, then, as a general axiom:</L>
<L>There's not an instance I shall cite,</L>
<L>Of Miss Imagination's flight,</L>
<L>But tends to prove how, more or less,</L>
<L>She cheats us of our happiness.</L>
<L>Remember this, and be aware on't,</L>
<L>For tho' it often seem apparent,</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="32"/>
That she on some delight is feeding,</L>
<L>Or is with joy and pleasure breeding,</L>
<L>She swells, as presently you'll find,</L>
<L>Either with water, or with wind;</L>
<L>Or else, with many a strange contortion,</L>
<L>Brings forth an embrio in abortion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The only comfort she is skill'd in</L>
<L>Is that fine art call'd Castle-building:</L>
<L>Pursuing which, sometimes, she'll rise</L>
<L>Ten thousand leagues above the skies;</L>
<L>And, ere you'd empty Mah'met's pitcher,</L>
<L>Find fifty thousand whims bewitch her;</L>
<L>There will the busy brain-sick fool</L>
<L>Among th' immortals place her stool:</L>
<L>But, on so ticklish a foundation,</L>
<L>The slightest jog of pain, or passion,</L>
<L>Strait tumbles down my anti-mentor,</L>
<L>Ten thousand leagues below the center.</L>

<LG>
<L>Should you demand the reason why</L>
<L>She sinks so low, and soars so high,</L>
<L>Is strong yet feeble, quick yet slow,</L>
<L>I'll tell you, William—when I know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Anon, invited by the weather,</L>
<L>She'll perch upon an ostrich feather;</L>
<L>Whence she'll persuade, with wheedling air,</L>
<L>Some maid to pin it in her hair:</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="33"/>
And there, to pay her thanks and duty,</L>
<L>She sits and forms the line of beauty;</L>
<L>Waves, curtsies, nods, and bows, to please</L>
<L>Each well-dress'd passenger she sees;</L>
<L>Hoping to find that man in dis-tress</L>
<L>Who does not long to kiss her mistress.</L>
<L>And, should the dear bewitching maid</L>
<L>But take her to a Masquerade,</L>
<L>Or jig her tail down at a Court dance,</L>

<L>That you might rival certain beaus—</L>
<L>To prove yourself the drunkard's match,</L>
<L>Have clapt and chorus'd ev'ry catch—</L>

She tells my Lord its very late,</L>
<L>Or, tickling, makes him scratch his pate,</L>
<L>And shake his well-fill'd wig about her;</L>
<L>Then skulks off in a shower of powder.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In graceful shape, you'll sometimes see her,</L>

<L>Sit bragging how she has the art</L>
<L>To deck that unimportant part;</L>
<L>To prove which farther still she goes,</L>

<L>MY similie is at an end;</L>
<L>To Fancy we'll return, my friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes she'll take it in her head,</L>
<L>To sit and muse among the dead;</L>
<L>And then, before your eye could twinkle,</L>
<L>She'll hop to th' charnel-house, and sprinkle</L>
<L>Some favorite friend's unconscious bones,</L>
<L>And hear again his dying groans;</L>
<L>And kiss his lips, and catch his sighs,</L>
<L>And cleanse his brow, and close his eyes;</L>
<L>And wring her hands, and rend her hair,</L>
<L>In all the horrors of despair:</L>
<L>As when she caught his parting breath,</L>
<L>In the last agonies of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
<L>Nor are such griefs to her ideal;</L>
<L>With Fancy every thing is real:</L>
<L>Which gives occasion to your sceptic,</L>
<L>Or, rather, to herself, to deem,</L>
<L>From these emotions epileptic,</L>
<L>That she exists but in a dream.</L>
<L>That soul and body, matter and spirit,</L>
<L>With all which men think they inherit,</L>
<L>To which they give such fond reception,</L>
<L>Is nothing but a meer deception.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I can't, said William, I protest,</L>
<L>Conceive such things, except in jest,</L>
<L>Have ever enter'd mortal head;</L>
<L>Have ever, yet, been sung, or said.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, pray inform me, by what token, Sir,</L>
<L>I shall gain certainty, fair spoken, Sir,</L>
<L>Replied Sir Thomas: or what sign</L>
<L>Shall bring conviction, friend of mine,</L>
<L>That I am now with you debating,</L>
<L>And 'gainst the post exonerating:</L>
<L>Or, though I think I make it shake,</L>
<L>I shall not shortly start and wake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why, Sir, last night, in my first sleep,</L>
<L>I, at my spigot end, did weep;</L>
<L>(Observe, when stomach too replete is,</L>
<L>I'm subject to your diabetes;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="41"/>
Which, though the bed it will besmear,</L>
<L>Is sweeter than your diarrhoea.)</L>
<L>I say, I stood against the wall,</L>
<L>And saw and heard the water fall;</L>
<L>It could not be behind the curtain,</L>
<L>So well convinc'd was I, and certain:</L>
<L>But more to prove it to the million,</L>
<L>I wrangled with my own postillion,</L>
<L>Dar'd the best man that e'er wore head</L>
<L>To prove that I then p—t the bed.</L>
<L>And yet, for all my fending feats,</L>
<L>Molly was forc'd to change the sheets;</L>
<L>At least, so did I after deem,</L>
<L>For so depos'd my waking dream.</L>
<L>But which was right, or which was wrong,</L>
<L>To your Logicians doth belong,</L>
<L>From Mr. Minor and Mr. Major,</L>
<L>By consequent, or else by wager,</L>
<L>These doubts and darkness to dispel;</L>
<L>For I'll be d—d if I can tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again—I dreamt one night before,</L>
<L>As I was standing at my door,</L>
<L>A woman came—a frightful figure—</L>
<L>And of a pistol held the trigger;</L>
<L>Her hands were bloody—she would enter,</L>
<L>And, as I follow'd, to prevent her</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="42"/>
From strangling my beloved Nancy,</L>
<L>She striding forward, to my fancy,</L>
<L>Just then, as I with fear was fainting,</L>
<L>I look'd and found her head was wanting.</L>
<L>And now my courage had forsook me,</L>
<L>Another terror overtook me.</L>
<L>Instead of Nancy's massacre,</L>
<L>I found that I had murder'd her;</L>
<L>For, being headless, it was plain</L>
<L>She had by somebody been slain;</L>
<L>So dreading to be left i' th' lurch,</L>
<L>I made a skip to top o' th' Church,</L>
<L>And on the steeple sat me down,</L>
<L>And laugh'd, and look'd about the town.</L>
<L>Here I was seiz'd a-new with fright;</L>
<L>For, meditating on the height,</L>
<L>And seeing nothing on the wall</L>
<L>That I could catch to save my fall,</L>
<L>I found, by calculation true,</L>
<L>As I look'd down, and took a view,</L>
<L>E'er I could light in streets or lanes,</L>
<L>'Twas odds that I dash'd out my brains.</L>
<L>Now for a moment I forgot</L>
<L>If I had being, or had not;</L>
<L>Then found myself upon my feet,</L>
<L>And walking up a spacious street:</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="43"/>
But, ere I could proceed much further,</L>
<L>Was taken up, and hung for murder;</L>
<L>To Sweeps and Sandmen did exhibit</L>
<L>A body dangling to a gibbet.</L>
<L>And now, I was not only vex'd,</L>
<L>But, somehow, damnably perplex'd,</L>
<L>To think, on finding I was dead,</L>
<L>What I should do to get my bread;</L>
<L>But in the midst of all this thrall,</L>
<L>I jump'd from thence to Surgeon's Hall:</L>
<L>Where I beheld a row of fellows,</L>
<L>That just were taken from the gallows;</L>
<L>Ill-looking, ragged, vile companions,</L>
<L>And strung all round like ropes of onions;</L>
<L>By wires hung pendant, as their wont is,</L>
<L><HI>'Tween</HI> os occipitis et frontis.</L>
<L>And here, instead of being dissected,</L>
<L>I see those operations acted.</L>
<L>My <HI>perinaeum</HI> shrinks to note 'em;</L>
<L>I clap my hand upon my <HI>scrotum,</HI></L>
<L>And view, the while my flesh doth quiver,</L>
<L>Now this man's heart, then that man's liver.</L>
<L>No mortal yet, by day or night,</L>
<L>Ever beheld more shocking sight.</L>
<L>Yet they're alive, nor are they screaming,</L>
<L>But wrangling, singing, and blaspheming,</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="44"/>
From mouths that with most ghastly grin,</L>
<L>Tobacco take, and beg for gin.</L>
<L>And here, amidst this scene of terrors,</L>
<L>I feel insufferable horrors;</L>
<L>I fly, oppress'd with dreadful gloom,</L>
<L>To every corner of the room:</L>
<L>From this man start, and jerk from t'other,</L>
<L>Then bob my back against another</L>
<L>Swifter than ball in Tennis-court,</L>
<L>'Till Nature can no more support,</L>
<L>But shrieks with violent agitation,</L>
<L>And, waking, says—its suffocation:</L>
<L>Or swears some fiend her rest was troubling,</L>
<L>Some Night-mare, Witch, or glum Hobgoblin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One other vision give me leave,</L>
<L>Among my arguments, to weave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I went one night, about eleven,</L>
<L>To bed—or, rather—went to Heaven.</L>
<L>'Twas in the latter end of spring,</L>
<L>My heart was light as Wood-lark's wing;</L>
<L>My health was good, my spirits better,</L>
<L>My mind without a single fetter;</L>
<L>By cares nor crosses was I teaz'd,</L>
<L>Nor spleen, nor passion, on me seiz'd:</L>
<L>I mean to say, I felt, just then,</L>
<L>What happiness is call'd, by men.</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="45"/>
I cannot give sufficient cause,</L>
<L>I only know that so it was;</L>
<L>And that such feelings, as it seems,</L>
<L>Do gen'rate most delightful dreams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I went to bed, then, thus dispos'd,</L>
<L>And, as I guess, not long had doz'd</L>
<L>Before I fell, by some blest chance,</L>
<L>Into a kind of heav'nly trance;</L>
<L>Unconscious I of sleep or bed,</L>
<L>No pillow now supports my head,</L>
<L>Nor bolts, nor bars, nor walls restrain,</L>
<L>Nor heavy limbs my soul detain;</L>
<L>But, gliding on, by swift degrees,</L>
<L>I seem to be where'er I please:</L>
<L>I lightly leap o'er brook, or briar,</L>
<L>And step—as far as I desire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Anon, on lofty hill I stand,</L>
<L>View the green corn, and furrow'd land;</L>
<L>See mountain, valley, wood and mead,</L>
<L>And shepherd stray, and cattle feed;</L>
<L>And distant hills, and waters spy,</L>
<L>That glitter pleasure to the eye;</L>
<L>While the sweet landscape doth unite</L>
<L>Innumerous objects of delight.</L>
<L>Then, quick as thought, they instant take</L>
<L>The form of an extensive lake,</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="46"/>
In amphitheatre capacious,</L>
<L>A flat of waters, bright and spacious,</L>
<L>Which Fancy quickly scatters o'er</L>
<L>With islands, towns, and many a shore,</L>
<L>Where verdure smiles, and men are seen,</L>
<L>And happy Nature plays serene.</L>
<L>Here, while I view the water's gleam,</L>
<L>I find myself amid the stream;</L>
<L>And, as the gentle current glides,</L>
<L>My active thought my body guides</L>
<L>To ship or shore, now there, now here,</L>
<L>Sportive and undisturb'd by fear;</L>
<L>And, as the waters we embrace,</L>
<L>I vagrant roam from place to place:</L>
<L>And, as I lave each happy limb,</L>
<L>And strike, and dart, and lightly skim,</L>
<L>I think, good God! how well I swim!</L>
<L>While thus supine I lie, anon,</L>
<L>I twinkle, and the whole is gone;</L>
<L>The scene is chang'd, no more appear</L>
<L>Or ships, or towns, or islands, near.</L>
<L>No more the chrystal waves are seen,</L>
<L>Two tow'ring mountains I'm between;</L>
<L>Prodigious in their height and size,</L>
<L>Their summits lie beyond the skies;</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="47"/>
Their magnitude new wonder brings,</L>
<L>From which a pleasing grandeur springs;</L>
<L>Such vast immensity before</L>
<L>The face of Nature never wore:</L>
<L>Nor e'er in me, till now did blend,</L>
<L>Such happy pow'rs to comprehend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While down the winding vale I stray,</L>
<L>Upon an ivory pipe I play</L>
<L>A various and delightful lay.</L>
<L>My fingers touch as though they flew,</L>
<L>Each note's so sweet, and yet so new,</L>
<L>I play and listen to the sound,</L>
<L>From rock to rock I lightly bound;</L>
<L>Sweet echos ev'ry cavern fill,</L>
<L>While my agility and skill</L>
<L>A mixture breed of strange surmize,</L>
<L>Of doubt, of pleasure, and surprize!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Encourag'd by the past, I try</L>
<L>If it be possible to fly:</L>
<L>When, strange to think, with utmost ease</L>
<L>I sail adown the pleasant breeze.</L>
<L>Amazement new, and new demur,</L>
<L>Again, and yet again, recur.</L>
<L>Have I my former self forgot?</L>
<L>Or is it me—or is it not?</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="48"/>
Again I try, again I find,</L>
<L>My body lighter than the wind;</L>
<L>Till, wanton grown, with joy and mirth,</L>
<L>I spurn the bosom of the earth;</L>
<L>Into the middle region mount,</L>
<L>And cities, seas, and kingdoms count:</L>
<L>Strait recollect, and now behold,</L>
<L>Whate'er I'ad read, or had been told.</L>
<L>My mind, my sight, my soul, expand;</L>
<L>I view the near and distant land,</L>
<L>Each object see, examine all,</L>
<L>And understand both great and small!</L>
<L>The freedom, too, with which I range</L>
<L>Is more extatic, than 'tis strange.</L>
<L>When, as I high, and higher, fly,</L>
<L>Sudden appear, throughout the sky,</L>
<L>Horses and men in glittering arms,</L>
<L>And nought is heard but war's alarms:</L>
<L>The warm bright sun, in splendant glances,</L>
<L>Plays quivering on their burnish'd lances.</L>
<L>Yet as I view the shining steel,</L>
<L>No sense of danger do I feel;</L>
<L>To win renown I now aspire,</L>
<L>And glow with all the hero's fire;</L>
<L>My arm bears vict'ry, I presage,</L>
<L>But, ere the armies can engage</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="49"/>
I look again, when, lo! the host</L>
<L>Is all in dancing meteors lost!</L>
<L>Still Night appears, and Luna's beams,</L>
<L>And light shoots o'er the sky in gleams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But how shall I find words to tell,</L>
<L>What, William, after this befel?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Conceive me sailing still on high,</L>
<L>That, swifter than the winds, I fly;</L>
<L>That, now, I feel a tempest rise,</L>
<L>In which I'm tost about the skies,</L>
<L>Which are with clouds and gloom o'ercast,</L>
<L>A trumpet blows a solemn blast;</L>
<L>Then, in the murky hemisphere,</L>
<L>Myriads of seraphim appear,</L>
<L>That all the heav'ns illuminate,</L>
<L>And joys, unfelt before, create.</L>
<L>They cry aloud—"THE GENERAL DOOM,</L>
<L>THE DAY OF RESURRECTION'S COME!"</L>
<L>And lo! as down my sight I bend,</L>
<L>Th' inhabitants of earth ascend!</L>
<L>In swarms they rise, from latest time,</L>
<L>From ev'ry nation, ev'ry clime!</L>
<L>The quick and dead of ev'ry coast,</L>
<L>Now, smiling, meet the angelic host!</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="50"/>
All upward, now, their course pursue,</L>
<L>'Till heav'n itself appears in view!</L>
<L>'Till the fam'd music of the spheres,</L>
<L>Salutes our ravish'd wond'ring ears!</L>
<L>But, William, just as I believe,</L>
<L>No pow'r can me of bliss bereave—</L>
<L>Just as th' eternal gates unfold,</L>
<L>And, past conceiving, I behold</L>
<L>The glories I must soon partake—</L>
<L>William—just then—alas—I wake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suddenly, thus, my hopes were gone,</L>
<L>In less time than St. Paul's strikes one!</L>
<L>And all, because, such was my lot,</L>
<L>Before I went to sleep, god-wot,</L>
<L>A certain duty I forgot.</L>
<L>Thus, while I had my heavenly trances,</L>
<L>My Lady had her earthly fancies.</L>
<L>Thus, while I floated in the air,</L>
<L>She, restless, tumbling here and there,</L>
<L>With her sharp elbow spoil'd my mirth,</L>
<L>And cast me down from heav'n to earth.</L>

<L>Oh could I but, my friend, have tarried</L>

<L>YOU, Sir, whose well-provided boat,</L>
<L>Blest Independence keeps afloat,</L>
<L>While she thus condescends to steer,</L>
<L>What tempests have YOU, Sir, to fear?</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="59"/>
She, with expert and jocund crew,</L>
<L>Weathers all winds that ever blew.</L>
<L>Should tow'ring Pride contemptuous think her,</L>
<L>And make her strike, It could not sink her;</L>
<L>Malice may shoot, but cannot shake her;</L>
<L>Lame Poverty can ne'er o'ertake her;</L>
<L>While Labour, Learning, Genius, all</L>
<L>Are ever ready at her call;</L>
<L>Happy, by her, to be employ'd,</L>
<L>Thrice happy if, by her, enjoy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From whence you argue, Cousin Will,</L>
<L>At least, we're easy, when we're still.</L>
<L>That, when kind heav'n has sent us meat,</L>
<L>We've only to sit down and eat.</L>
<L>But, when the passions are in chace,</L>
<L>It, then, may prove a silly race.</L>

<L>Whence, I conjecture, you profess</L>
<L>That apathy is happiness;</L>
<L>That he, whose wishes breed no riot,</L>
<L>Is comfortable, good, and quiet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To such a one I'd grant, at most,</L>
<L>He's just as happy as a post.</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="60"/>
His goodness, likewise, be it said,</L>
<L>Is like a wife's without her head;</L>
<L>Who, tho' her humours never teize you,</L>
<L>Her kisses are not like to please you:</L>
<L>For she, 'tis held, who has no mouth,</L>
<L>Will neither kiss, nor quench her drowth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For this, friend William, I contend,</L>
<L>Better had man his being end,</L>
<L>And die at once, since die he must,</L>
<L>Than, with inanity, to rust.</L>
<L>Better, than thus to mope and doze,</L>

<L>Better, than thus to sit hum drum,</L>

<L>YET sure, said Will, Sir, some of those</L>
<L>Whom Fame, as Nature's wonders, shews;</L>
<L>Who, high in honours, high in birth,</L>
<L>Rever'd for sacred virtue's worth;</L>
<L>Whose deeds, descent, and merits are</L>
<L>Held equally renown'd and rare;</L>
<L>Or those whose fortunes some blest chance</L>
<L>Conspir'd with Genius to advance;</L>
<L>And gave, what Genius deems his due,</L>
<L>A seat among th' immortal few;</L>
<L>Sure those brave spirits, who, when fled,</L>
<L>Were ever call'd the mighty dead;</L>
<L>Whose actions grace the scroll of Fame,</L>
<L>Sure those to happiness had claim.</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="62"/>
And, 'tis an axiom, long in use,</L>
<L>Like causes like effects produce.</L>
</LG>

<L>From whence, friend Will, you would infer,</L>
<L>Some men <HI>are</HI> blest, because some <HI>were.</HI></L>
<L>But this wont pass, my cunning stager,</L>

<LG>
<L>These mighty dead, of whom you puff,</L>
<L>And think you ne'er can brag enough;</L>
<L>Nor your trull Fame (whose cheeks are bloated</L>
<L>Like bladders, on which boys have floated)</L>
<L>Stuft out and cramm'd with lies enormous,</L>
<L>About her slashing, swashing Hectors,</L>
<L>Her grim Mandragons—Plusquamperfectors,</L>
<L>Of suffering man the curst dissectors,</L>

<L>These Anthropophaginian Cyclops,</L>
<L>That tap who never had the Hydrops,</L>
<L>These Caco-daemons, I maintain, Sir,</L>
<L>Of whom both she and you are vain, Sir,</L>
<L>As subject were to flux, or cancer,</L>
<L>As you, or I, or any man, Sir:</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="63"/>
As liable to puke, and be sick,</L>
<L>When they were order'd to take physic;</L>
<L>As much would scratch and writhe and groan,</L>
<L>At itch, gripes, gravel, gout, or stone;</L>
<L>With screw'd-up phiz would grunt and twist—Oh la!</L>
<L>When they were cutting for a fistula;</L>
<L>Would faint as soon if, for a scotomy,</L>
<L>The Doctor should prescribe phlebotomy;</L>
<L>As much would caper, curse, and kick,</L>
<L>When needle under nail did stick;</L>
<L>As much were tortur'd by brain-tumours,</L>
<L>I mean as captious in their humours,</L>
<L>Would fret and fume, and be as fractious,</L>
<L>As drunken chymney-sweeps or blackshoes;</L>
<L>Would break the crockery, spill the grey peas,</L>
<L>And cuff their wives, and whip their babies,</L>
<L>Burn tables, stools, and chairs to cinders,</L>
<L>And toss the house out at the windows;</L>
<L>Would pinch, bite, scratch, snarl, scold or squabble,</L>
<L>Like Billinsgate or Ragfair rabble.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks I hear one of these heroes,</L>
<L>Who little better were than Neros,</L>
<L>Wrangling with Ma'am, and domineering,</L>
<L>Bullying at this, at that thing sneering,</L>
<L>Cry—"D—n your pudding—d—n your beef,</L>

<L><PB N="66" REF="64"/>
"Damme I'd rather munch a dry crust</L>
<L>"Alone, than live with you on pie-crust;</L>
<L>"For neither you, your soup, or sallad,</L>
<L>"Are made at all to please my palate."</L>
<L>If Ma'am replies, he lays the lash on,</L>
<L>And, with his hair erect, with passion,</L>
<L>Out issues he, brimful of ire,</L>
<L>Snorts swords, breathes brimstone, and spits fire,</L>
<L>Snuffs gunpowder, rips up red coats,</L>
<L>Cuts you some fifty thousand throats,</L>
<L>Leaves not a rat, cat, hog, or dog an eye,</L>
<L>But cleaves them as you'd cleave mahogany;</L>
<L>Vineyards and fields devours in malice,</L>
<L>And quaffs hot blood in scull-scoop'd chalice:</L>
<L>Then vaunts his most pernicious pranks,</L>

<LG>
<L>Good Sir, said Will, I ne'er suppos'd</L>
<L>Content, by such folks, was engross'd.</L>
<L>Far other men were in my guess,</L>
<L>Whom every age and people bless;</L>
<L>Who useful arts the nations taught,</L>
<L>Or who for Freedom bravely fought;</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="65"/>
Who, first, with ploughshare, broke the glebe,</L>
<L>Or pass'd the shuttle thro' the web;</L>
<L>He who conducted lovely Truth</L>
<L>And Science to the haunts of Youth,</L>
<L>Aptly their pleasing lore convey'd,</L>
<L>And all their wond'rous gifts display'd.</L>
<L>Of such I spoke—or he whose song</L>
<L>Charm'd and reform'd the listening throng.</L>
<L>Who, as the ringing harp he swung,</L>
<L>Rais'd his sweet voice and rapid tongue</L>
<L>In phrase most fit, and lofty verse,</L>
<L>The deeds of heroes to rehearse!</L>
<L>(Of heroes, who, by Virtue claim'd,</L>
<L>Among th' immortal Gods are nam'd)</L>
<L>Who, as along the numbers roll'd,</L>
<L>The laws of Nature could unfold!</L>
<L>Or with a sad and piteous tale</L>
<L>The man of iron could assail;</L>
<L>Or, when Oppression durst provoke,</L>
<L>In thunder to the passions spoke!</L>
<L>Their headlong rage would strait controul,</L>
<L>"And freeze and harrow up the soul!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How oft, friend Will, reply'd the Knight,</L>
<L>Am I oblig'd to set you right;</L>
<L>Again repeating, and again,</L>
<L>Men ever were, and will be men?</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="66"/>
Why must I tell you, no man, yet,</L>
<L>That Eve and Adam could beget,</L>
<L>(This to your memory pray recall,</L>
<L>Adam and Eve begat us all;</L>
<L>For, in their primary endeavour,</L>
<L>World without end, for ever and ever,</L>
<L>The blacks and whites, and those of copper,</L>
<L>Were ground out of our Granny's hopper.</L>
<L>Such is the orthodoxy dixit,</L>
<L>And d—d be he who contradicts it.)</L>
<L>No man is freed from Fate's mischances,</L>
<L>Except in novels and romances?</L>
<L>The brightest characters have blots;</L>
<L>The sun itself is full of spots:</L>
<L>Which, as I guess, ar'n't very young,</L>
<L>Yet have not been discover'd long.</L>
<L>In fact, our eyes are oft so feeble,</L>
<L>They'd overlook the parish steeple;</L>
<L>And tho' sent forth to search and mind it,</L>
<L>Return and say they could not find it.</L>
<L>You see these folks thro' a dark lantern,</L>
<L>And still, most carefully, your hand turn,</L>
<L>Full on each face to throw the light,</L>
<L>Then wonder how it came so bright.</L>
<L>So once a painter, in supposes,</L>
<L>The radiance drew of grandsire Moses;</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="67"/>
And, when he'd done, so says the story,</L>
<L>Fell down and worshipp'd his own glory:</L>
<L>But (for a Christian cuckolds scorns)</L>
<L>He quite forgot to add the horns.</L>
<L>Tho' Jews, with reverence be it spoken,</L>
<L>Hold horns a magisterial token;</L>
<L>Which is the reason, say the witty,</L>
<L>Why Jews do mostly live i'th' city.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But to our text—I say, once more,</L>
<L>All's not divine that men adore.</L>
<L>Your Germans bow to Jacob Behmen,</L>
<L>Your Greeks, Sir, reverence Philopaemon.</L>
<L>Saint Januarius keeps, at Naple,</L>
<L>A market where he's always staple.</L>
<L>Your Russian is tied down to th' grindstone</L>
<L>Of Nicholases holy mill-stone.</L>
<L>Some love th' eleven hundred virgins;</L>
<L>Your Jews and Turks are circum-surgeons:</L>
<L>And he who dares be het'rodox,</L>
<L>Had better get the plague, or p-x.</L>
<L>For priests in all lands preach and pray,</L>
<L>Not to convince, but get the day,</L>
<L>Or, what is better still, the pay:</L>
<L>And tho' some bid each humble brother,</L>
<L>When smote on one cheek, to turn t'other,</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="68"/>
Oppos'd themselves, they still incline 'em</L>
<L><HI>To</HI> Argumentum Bacculinum:</L>
<L>And he's puff'd down, who their fine flams scorns,</L>
<L>Like Jericho, at blast of rams-horns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Will star'd, and cry'd, Sir, whither verge you?</L>
<L>You're not a foe sure to the Clergy!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That, Will, depends on circumstances,</L>
<L>I'm no man's foe who peace advances;</L>
<L>Who, mild and gentle, strives to win,</L>
<L>Not <HI>to</HI> opinion—but <HI>from</HI> sin:</L>
<L>Who, like the Parson of old Dryden,</L>
<L>Would scorn Oppression's back to ride on:</L>
<L>Who can suppose a Turk may be</L>
<L>Almost as good a man as he,</L>
<L>And that opinions with salvation</L>
<L>Are not allied, in any nation;</L>
<L>That, tho' a man were so absurd</L>
<L>As not to b'lieve a single word</L>
<L>O'th' stuff with which some folks are cram'd,</L>
<L>There yet are hopes he may'nt be damn'd.</L>
<L>Or, let's suppose what's still absurder,</L>
<L>Since supposition is no murder,</L>
<L>One who has faith in all the fictions,</L>
<L>The fables, lies, and contradictions</L>
<L>That e'er were broach'd from Folly's mouth,</L>
<L>Between the North pole and the South;</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="69"/>
Who'd worship MoIock, God of Ammon,</L>
<L>Or dance to Tomtom round Ramraman;</L>
<L>Pay Mumbo-jumbo adoration,</L>
<L>Hold Pawaws in vast veneration;</L>
<L>Believe i'th' navel-string of Brama,</L>
<L>Eat holy dung of Dalay Lama;</L>
<L>Credit the tale of St. Gelasias</L>
<L>As much as Creed of Athanasius;</L>
<L>Resolving to have faith in all,</L>
<L>Lest men him heretic should call;</L>
<L>The Priest who'd hope my love to win,</L>
<L>Must think e'en this no mortal sin:</L>
<L>With points of doctrine must dispense,</L>
<L>From who've too much or little sense,</L>
<L>Provided they to others do</L>
<L>As they wish to be done unto:</L>
<L>Must still preserve that simple plan</L>
<L>Which his meek Master first began;</L>
<L>On human hearts must make invasion</L>
<L>By gentleness, and mild persuasion;</L>
<L>Nor think to cure the mind of maggots</L>
<L>By purging it with fiery faggots:</L>
<L>Nor must pretend, if me he'd please,</L>
<L>To supernat'ral extasies;</L>
<L>But must be as sincere as kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This brings an anecdote to mind,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="70"/>
Concerning an irreverend Friar,</L>
<L>Miracle-monger, therefore liar;</L>
<L>A relic juggler, most rapacious;</L>
<L>Of life luxurious and salacious,</L>
<L>Who watch'd a wooden virgin's shrine,</L>
<L>And was, by fools, suppos'd divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd, one Summer, where he dwelt,</L>
<L>The heavens did not that year melt,</L>
<L>As usual, in refreshing showers,</L>
<L>To chear the thirsty, languid flowers;</L>
<L>Hence, 'twas much fear'd, the gasping earth</L>
<L>Would feel a universal dearth.</L>
<L>Hence, too, did selfish Superstition</L>
<L>To heav'n send many a vague petition;</L>
<L>But, in the midst of this her grief,</L>
<L>Our Friar promis'd her relief;</L>
<L>If to his shrine she'd make procession,</L>
<L>The clouds should, likewise, make emission;</L>
<L>For so, said he, the holy mother</L>
<L>Has told me, your unworthy brother.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well, Sir,—the farce is underta'en,</L>
<L>When lo! it strait begins to rain;</L>
<L>A Miracle! the people cry,</L>
<L>A Miracle! resounds on high.</L>
<L>The gaping crowd run here and there,</L>
<L>And tell of angels made of air;</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="71"/>
Trot home for off'rings not a few,</L>
<L>To pay old scores as well as new;</L>
<L>And, as they bring their glad oblations,</L>
<L>Recount their many obligations;</L>
<L>And how the Virgin did inspire,</L>
<L>With prophecy, her holy Friar;</L>
<L>While he applauds his dext'rous wit,</L>
<L>And laughs to think how fools are bit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You ask how he could here deceive:</L>
<L>I'll tell you, if you'll give me leave.</L>
<L>Not by his faith did he foretell,</L>
<L>His want of faith did just as well.</L>
<L>His lust, and former fornication,</L>
<L>Supplied the place of Revelation.</L>
<L>For nought of Heav'n, or Hell, more true is,</L>
<L>Than that the Friar had a Lues,</L>
<L>Of ten years standing at the least,</L>
<L>Which us'd to twinge the unclean beast;</L>
<L>And taught him, from his pangs, to gather</L>
<L>Prognostics of a change of weather.</L>
<L>Which cheat this reverend, chaste divi e,</L>
<L>Discover'd to his concubine;</L>
<L>And she, being tickled with the joke,</L>
<L>Told it to all with whom she spoke;</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="72"/>
While those who heard, fail'd not to scoff it,</L>
<L>And say the p—x had made a prophet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You seem to wonder where I'll end,</L>
<L>And whither all these windings tend:</L>
<L>I'll tell you, Will, they form a mirror,</L>
<L>That shews men lost in fogs of error.</L>
<L>They tend to prove my first position,</L>
<L>THAT HAPPINESS IS ALL A VISION;</L>
<L>A shadow which men keep in view,</L>
<L>That runs as fast as they pursue,</L>
<L>Stands when they stand, winds when they wind,</L>
<L>Sometimes before, sometimes behind,</L>
<L>At all attempts to catch it mocks,</L>
<L>And ne'er was brought t'an Equinox:</L>
<L>At no one moment would allow</L>
<L>A man to say—<HI>I have thee now.</HI></L>
<L>They tend to shew, that life, at best,</L>
<L>As saith Dan Gay, is but a jest;</L>
<L>A candle, where fresh tumors sprout,</L>
<L>Which, to remove, is oft snuff▪d out</L>
<L>By Law or Honour, Rope or Sword,</L>
<L>As Judge or General gives the word:</L>
<L>And he has sure a lucky snuffing,</L>
<L>Who's cropt from cradle into coffin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>
<L>And should you think these doctrines vain,</L>
<L>Hear, Will, the moral they contain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So short a time are mortals twirl'd</L>
<L>About this transitory world;</L>
<L>(For he who tarries longest in it</L>
<L>Can scarce be said to live a minute)</L>
<L>So little do we truly know,</L>
<L>What shall bring future weal or woe;</L>
<L>Such trifles are the things we prize,</L>
<L>In Truth and sober Reason's eyes;</L>
<L>So futile and incompetent,</L>
<L>To make one blessing permanent;</L>
<L>That he who'd ignominious live,</L>
<L>For any good this world can give;</L>
<L>Would condescend to recollect</L>
<L>The loss of Worth, and Worth's respect;</L>
<L>Or, to obtain some private end,</L>
<L>To guilt, or meanness could descend,</L>
<L>And act, from self-applause exempt,</L>
<L>What sinks him into self-contempt;</L>
<L>Could see how short, how vague, how vain</L>
<L>Are joys, and all that joys contain;</L>
<L>Yet, seeing this, could be betray'd,</L>
<L>Doth Common-sense so much degrade,</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="74"/>
Such ample infamy deserves,</L>
<L>If he with such conviction swerves,</L>
<L>No epithet, by man express'd,</L>
<L>That Wit or Malice can suggest,</L>
<L>Or scurril Rancour e'er devis'd,</L>
