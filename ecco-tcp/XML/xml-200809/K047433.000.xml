<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>To gain the public ear, the man of rhimes</L>
<L>Should always speak the language of the times;</L>
<L>And little else hath been of late in hearing</L>
<L>Than terms and phrases of Electioneering.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our author therefore sends me to assure ye,</L>
<L>Worthy and free electors of Old Drury,</L>
<L>How happy he should prove, if it content you,</L>
<L>That he be one of those who represent you;</L>
<L>The state <HI>Poetic,</HI> laws and legislature,</L>
<L>Like the <HI>Political</HI> in form and nature;</L>
<L>Phoebus, the Nine, and Bards of reputation</L>
<L>King, Peerage, Commons, of the scribbling nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from Parnassus' throne the Prince of Wit,</L>
<L>It seems, hath issued out his royal writ</L>
<L>For a new member.—No offence to give</L>
<L>To a late worthy representative;</L>
<L>Who, ris'n to favour, hath from us retreated,</L>
<L>And 'mongst the Lords of t'other house is seated, —</L>
<L>His service lost, presuming you may need him,</L>
<L>The present candidate would fain succeed him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that he vainly boasts, on this occasion,</L>
<L>He met encouragement from your persuasion;</L>
<L>Or that both friends, who love, and foes, who hate him,</L>
<L>Have been unanimous to nominate him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis for this loyal borough his affection,</L>
<L>And patriot zeal, that make him risk th' election;</L>
<L>To his constituents subject to controul;</L>
<L>With whose good leave, he means to stand the poll;</L>
<L>Trusting secure to their impartial choice:</L>
<L>The town uncanvass'd for a single voice;</L>
<L>Nay, brib'd no brother burgess bard of note,</L>
<L>Nor by corruption gain'd one critick's vote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too proud to beg, too modest to demand,</L>
<L>By merit only would he fall or stand:</L>
<L>Nor enmity nor friendship interfering,</L>
<L>He only asks a fair and candid hearing.</L>
<L>If, after that, you should with scorn reject him,</L>
<L>Or make one honest scruple to elect him,</L>
<L>He'll lay his unadvised scheme aside,</L>
<L>And frankly own himself <HI>NOT QUALIFIED.</HI></L>

<STAGE>Enter <HI>Mineral,</HI> and <HI>Furnival</HI> with a news-paper in his hand.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mineral.</SPEAKER>
<P>IS there any thing in the papers, Barrister?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but medical nostrums, and lists of idle company at these watering places.—One would think the whole kingdom was infected with the plague.</P>
<STAGE>[Giving <HI>Mineral</HI> the news-paper.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>With two at least, credulity, and dissipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>By both which, doctor we thrive, and have therefore no reason to complain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that:mdash;they are useful indeed, to you liberal adventurers, who depend on tre doc∣trine of chances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and to you medical adventurers too. The practice of physick depends as much on the doctrine of chances as that of gaming. Besides, cre∣dulity breeds quacks, as dissipation does gamesters; and both may become too general for us regular practitioners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may so;—but you seem, Barrister, to have thrown up the cards, with regard to public parties at least;—you play a higher game, I suppose, in private; eh!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, cards and dice are but paultry tools in the hands of a real artist. The passions and foibles of mankind are not only more effectual, but more entertaining implements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, —but you can play upon them at the card-table; I have seen you do it, Barrister; I have seen you do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, when you were at the same game, doctor?—Ah! You spiders of the faculty spin your thread as fine as any of the fraternity; woe be to the poor flies that are entangled in your web.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but we physicians do let our patients recover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, sometimes; as we gamesters let novices win, and for the same reason; to hook them only deeper into play. Do you ever cure any body of coming to Bath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, we have some regard to the prosperity of the corporation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to your own doctor.—Every crazy constitution that arrives, becomes to you physicians a good annuity; a copyhold inheritance, of which you are tenants for life. For your own sakes, there∣fore, you must keep the tottering tenements from tumbling. But that's all: if you patch them up to stand wind and weather, from season to season, it is as much as you require. A thorough repair might bring on a writ of ejectment, and undo you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Barrister, you are now too severe; do you think the faculty quite void of the milk of human kindness? Have we no nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>The milk of human kindness, ha! ha! ha! —Yes, yes, you make a fine milch cow of poor na∣ture indeed.—But come let us hear: who are our new comers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, let us see— <STAGE>[Reads the news-paper.]</STAGE>— arrived since our last, the duke and duchess of Dangle-court; the earl and countess of Squander-field; count Splenetic; baron Podagra; lord and lady Dupe; lord Courtly.—O, pray, is not that he, who had such an ill run the last meeting at New-market?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same;—six thousand upon Gimcrack, and four upon Silver-Legs;—faith the turf was a little cruel to him, considering the state of his fi∣nances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I suppose he has now mortgaged his estate, and is come to take his revenge of New-market races, on the rooms at Bath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entre nous, doctor, his estate was dipped before: but let that go no farther. I am under obliga∣tions to his lordship, and have the honour of his confi∣dence.—Have we any more of the right honourables?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, —but commoners, like herrings at Shet∣land in shoals.— <STAGE>[Reads again.]</STAGE> Sir Peregrine Peevish, and lady; Mr. alderman Lombard; Mr. and Mrs. Fretful; the two Miss Drinkwaters, Master and Miss Ricketty; and so on, with Mr. and Mrs; Master and Miss, to the end of the catalogue.—Do you know any of these I have mentioned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the alderman is consigned to me: do you know him?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very well. I was called in when he was last at Bath, and sound him laid up with the gout. We set him upon his legs again with difficulty, in a month. But the boisterous wretch swore our sees were so exorbitant, that he would hobble upon crutches through the ward of Cripplegate all his life∣time,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
sooner than be so fleeced again, by any water-doctors in Christendom.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! well said Mr. Alderman, you must know he is a kind of wit.—He is come down now to stand candidate for a vacant borough here in the West: to which he is gone over, to shew himself to the constituents.—He is recommended to me by our old friend Scrutiny Canvass, of Lincoln's-Inn; who tells me the curmudgeon rolls in wealth, and, though covetous as a miser in any laudable pursuit, is lavish as a prodigal in the prosecution of any absurd project of his own; at present, it seems, he is dis∣posed to empty his coffers to get into parliament; so that if money will effect it, he is in a fair way of be∣coming a limb of the legislative body of Great-Britain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a lame one he is likely to prove; how∣ever, I wish you success with him.—Egad, here he comes.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I expected. He was to meet me here, on his return, to settle the business of the canvass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well;—I shall only just renew my acquaint∣ance, and take leave of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I believe you need not withdraw. I shall affect no secrets; for whenever a man wants to take the advantage of another, his surest mode of de∣ception is the appearance of openness and plain-dealing.</P>
<STAGE>[Mineral <HI>walks to the back of the stage and, puts the news paper in his pocket.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Alderman <HI>Lombard.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Alderman, your humble servant.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! counsellor! your servant.—Well I have—but— <STAGE>[seeing Mineral]</STAGE> you are not alone, I see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only a particular friend of mine, and I find an old acquaintance of yours too, Mr. Alderman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[coming forward]</STAGE>
<P>Mr. Lombard your most obsequious.—I hope I have the satisfaction to see you well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, your servant, doctor, your servant.— Tolerably well, I thank you; my supporters are pretty stout at present, if you can reap any satisfaction from seeing that.—I do from feeling it, I assure you.</P>
<STAGE>[Stamps sturdily on the ground.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I from hearing it, believe me, Mr. Alderman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, doctor, I can't; but no compli∣ments. —I don't come to Bath this time to be made such a fool of as I was the last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>It will be well for you if you are not made a worse, considering how much better hands you have fallen into.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd you think it, Squire Furnival, when I was here two years ago, this worthy physician and his associates had the conscience to take above a hun∣dred guineas of me, only for coaxing the cramp out of my great toe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>A violent paroxysm of the gout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gave it that formidable name indeed, to enhance the merit of your prescriptions; but what did you administer but a dozen or two of in∣nocent slip slops, and as many gallons of insipid warm water?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir! Mr. Lombard's was a bad case, a very bad case indeed! we had frequent consultations of the faculty upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, my case was a bad one sure enough; for, while you and your accomplices had your hand in my purse, and merited the discipline of the horse-pond, you hurried me without mercy to be duck'd and pump'd like a pick-pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are pleased to be sarcastical, Mr. Lom∣bard; but when the sit returns, I shall find you of a
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
different opinion. So, 'till then, your most obsequi∣ous humble servant.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! good day to you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, Mr. Alderman, you were so severe on my friend Mineral. The doctor has more interest in the borough of Gluttonbury, than, you imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>He cures the mayor and aldermen of at least a dozen surfeits in a year. They cannot possibly live without him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odso, I am sorry for that: and yet I am partly glad of it too; as you say he is your friend, you may easily excuse my raillery;—tell him it is my way, —that's an excuse for any thing, you know: or, egad, for the matter of that, if I thought 'twou'd secure him in our interest, I'd be taken with a slight touch of the gout to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not just now, Mr. Alderman, if you please. Electioneering is bustling work, and if we shou'd be hard run, you may have a use for your feet, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha!—well, —I have been to Gluttonbury!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope to good purpose, Mr. Alderman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I am afraid, to very little. You shall judge. As I was quite a stranger in the place, I naturally inquired, you know, for the mayor of the corporation; who received me kindly enough for a stranger, and civilly offered to call a meeting of the principal town's-people the next day. Accordingly I got a speech ready for them at my inn, over night, and met his worship, with Mr. recorder, and the rest, in the town-hall, in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, so far so good: but you shall hear.— I assured them, as usual on these occasions, of my firm attachment to my king and country in general, and of my regard for Gluttonbury in particular.—
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Then I talked to them a good deal about the consti∣tution, and the revolution, and the protestant suc∣cession, and all that;—giving them, now and then, a little liberty and property, trade and prosperity, and so forth: and, egad upon the whole, I thought I acquitted myself with energy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what effect had it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No effect at all, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No effect at all in the world, Sir, I assure you. You may well be surprized, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, its not so very surprizing neither: Oratory, like every thing else, has its day. We have seen some of our greatest speakers talk themselves out of breath, till they talked themselves out of credit. For, after all, words are but wind, you know, Mr. Alderman.—Had you no bank-pape rabout you? a written plea has sometimes a better effect than one delivered viva voce; not all the rhetorical flourishes of Cicero and Demosthenes put together, have half the pathos of the plain hand-writing of three or four petty clerks in Thread-needle-street;—bank-notes, bank-notes, Mr. Lombard, are now a-days, the only prevailing arguments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Mr. Furnival, I begin to think we citizens don't rightly understand these matters.—You gentlemen of the law know how to go about them much better. For my part, I own it is a little out of my way. All I can say therefore is, that if you will undertake the canvass, you shall want no mate∣rials, that I can furnish.—But, —pray, what is my rival candidate? He is a man of war, I find;—does he carry any weight of metal?—Has he the summum bonum about him? ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems he has a good estate, Sir, besides his commission.—He bears a very great character in the neighbourhood. They tell me he is a patriot, a
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
man of public spirit, one whose motto is Dulce e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> decorum—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>—pro patria morum. Ha! Mr. Furnival. Ay, I remember the passage;—I have construed it formerly at Merchant-Taylor's;—tho', by the way, I remember I thought it mighty silly, even in those days. Die for one's country! ha, ha, ha!—That might be patriotism among the ancient Romans; but we modern patriots live upon our country, Mr. Fur∣nival. Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! very well, very well, indeed, Mr. Lombard.—But, as to men of your antagonist's profession, they are bound in honour, you know, to die at the word of command without grumbling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, counsellor, right:—But what—he has a regiment, —he is a colonel, I think!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bloody-minded colonel, I assure you, Mr. Lombard; one who makes it his boast, that he is ready to spill the last drop in his veins, in defence of his constituents. He'll bleed for 'em, Mr. Lom∣bard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bleed for them! Ha, ha, ha! Yes, yes, he must bleed for them, and that pretty freely too, let me tell him, if he intends to stand the poll with me.— But stay, here's company coming: suppose we adjourn to my lodgings, and there settle our plan of business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or to mine, Sir, which are nearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart.</P>

<STAGE>Enter <HI>Narcissa</HI> and <HI>Sophia.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, cousin Sophy! your papa, I find, is arrived at Bath; we shall now see what account you will give of yourself, for having contracted a violent inclination for a man without his knowledge; and that too for a man whom he never saw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I contract a violent inclination for a man, Narcissa! what, I suppose, because Colonel Camply has repeated his visits pretty frequently of late!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, it is too late to retract now. It is to no purpose to play the prude with me, or the co-quet with him any longer. Have not you said an hundred times, that you preferred colonel Camply to all the men in the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must have talked in my sleep then, Nar∣cissa: for I am certain my tongue never so betrayed my heart while I was waking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oho! you confess, then, it wou'd have be∣trayed your heart, if it had talked so. Ah! cousin Sophy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, that's provoking now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! a little slip of that same tongue, my dear. — But, make yourself easy; for waking or sleeping, I believe it is very innocent of betraying your regard for colonel Camply, my in∣formation is founded on better authority, I assure you. Those speaking eyes of yours, Sophy, are apter tell-tales.—What you reckon nothing, it seems, on the significant nods, expressive smiles, and lan∣guishing looks, the colonel and you have been re∣ciprocally exchanging, these three months past.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, go, you are a giddy girl, Narcissa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you a sober, stay'd, prudent, unmar∣ried gentlewoman, just turn'd of twenty! Prithee cast off this formality of countenance, and leave it to the wear of mincing abigails, and maiden aunts, with their other weather-beaten remnants of anti∣quity. I tell you it does not at all become a girl hardly out of her teens, and little older than myself. Believe me, those who affect to be grave when they are young, will be glad to be merry when they are old; excuse me, my dear, but I am a little in spirits this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you have always an astonishing flow of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not, I?—Well, but come? How is it to be? The colonel will break the matter, I sup∣pose, to your father; the bargain will be struck, the
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
match hustled up, cloaths bought, jewels presented, and the day fix'd immediately. I shall be all impa∣tience till it be settled, and we stand up to dance at your wedding. I have not had a country dance, no not this half century, as lady Pedigree says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this business, which you seem to have dispatched so expeditiously, may be longer in settling than you imagine, if, indeed, it be ever settled at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! What's the matter now? Your lover and you are, I am sure, so far agreed, that you need only tell each other your minds; if you have not done it already. He has a fine fortune of his own, and is satisfied with yours, though not a penny be added to your grandfather's legacy. And then your papa, who loves you so tenderly as to see you once a year, and write to you by some of his clerks once a quarter, will hardly plead paternal fondness, to keep you longer on his hands.</P>
</SP>

<P>I don't know how it will be. There is like to be a strange revolution in my father's affairs. I learn he is going to be married himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Himself! well, but I hope he'll be so good as to see you married first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the same time, I suppose, my dear, to save charges; for I hear he has partly made up a match for me with some noble lord.—</P>
<STAGE>[Sighs.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you sigh for that, Sophy? Now for my part, were I in your case, I should think it mighty clever; that is, on a supposition the lord were deserving of the lady. For as you have no violent inclination, you know, for colonel Camply, it is an easy matter to break through a slight one for a private gentleman, in favour of a peer.—O gad, that I had but an independent fortune of thirty thou∣sand pounds, as you have, and that two or three of these lords wou'd pay their court to me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what wou'd you do? Wou'd you have one of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, if I lik'd them well enough. Other∣wise I should be apt to shew myself a daughter of Eve, and repeat the first sin of disobedience, if any father of mine should take upon him to know what I lik'd better than I did myself. But why do I talk?— Poor I! that am dependent, and can expect barely half that sum—</P>

<P>Have yet a viscount for one admirer, and a commoner for another, worth e'er a lord of them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say that.—I have not the vanity to compare Mr. Melmoth, my Sir Frederic that may be, to the flower of the British nobility; tho' I own I would not exchange him for the best of the bunch of baronets.—But yonder comes the colonel, in his usual sorrowful saunter, with his hands in his bosom, and such a penitential countenance! What, in the name of wonder, can be the matter with him now? Had you a quarrel with him last night? Did he win of you at cards, tear the mount of your fan, tread upon the train of your new sack, or make a loud whisper of a secret that has been publicly talked of among your acquaintance for these four months?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, what can that be, Narcissa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the old story, man's constancy and woman's caprice, the subject of half the love songs and halfpenny ballads that has been chanted since Cupid was an arch wag, and his mother an errant jilt. Upon my word, Sophy, you sometimes treat that poor gentleman very ill; and if you don't be∣have more consistently, I will as surely tell him, as it is true, that your cruelty is all affected; that you are as much in love with him, as he is with you; and, in short, that you doat on him to absurdity.— Therefore look to it, Sophy, look to it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call you that an unlucky circumstance? If you have a mind to take any advantage of it, it may, on the contrary, prove a lucky one; for if I know any thing of my father, he will certainly give up to you all his authority over his daughter Sophy, if you will give up to him all your interest in the borough of Gluttonbury.—And, indeed, now I think on't, you are rather too young, colonel, for a senator.— Besides, I should not chuse to have a husband taken up with the business of the nation, when he should be employed in mine.</P>

<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, mama, what harm can there be in the indulgence of a little harmless mirth? Is it possible my chearfulness can give any body offence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fearful, my dear, lest it should offend nobody so much as yourself. When I was of your age, I was just such another wild unthinking thing as you are. Careless of censure, and pre∣sumptuous that while I preserved my innocence, I might laugh at decorum, as mere formality; but the world is come to such a pass, Narcissa, that vir∣tue itself is often of less consequence to the peace and happiness of our lives than the appearance of it. It is not enough to be innocent, unless we seem so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in what do I appear so heinously guilty, madam? In laughing at the rueful dejection of the poor colonel, or in giving encouragement to the addresses of Mr. Melmoth, to whom you have never before made any objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, my dear, I have hitherto made none, because I wou'd not assume too great an influence over you, in making a choice of so much
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
importance to the future happiness of your life. But I shou'd but ill discharge the duty of a mother, Nar∣cissa, if I did not confess, and that without any par∣ticular objection to Mr. Melmoth, that I think you would be much happier with my lord Courtly, who hath made the fairest offers, and of whose regard for you, I am now more than ever convinced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to lord Courtly, Madam, for his good opinion of me; and under other circum∣stances he might possibly have had less reason to com∣plain of my indifference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, I only speak my sen∣timents. I have no objection to your engaging the affections or encouraging the addresses of any de∣serving lover; but I must insist on your indulging yourself less in raillery, at the expence of your friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I shou'd think, Madam, one's friends would be the least apt to take offence, and that the behaviour you complain of might be a good method to put their friendship to the proof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think wrong, Narcissa. I know, by woful experience, the danger of trifling with a heart that loves one. It was this fatal indis∣cretion in me that gave rise to a groundless jealousy in the breast of the fondest of husbands, and de∣prived you of the tender affections of a father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy, Madam, in having that loss so well supplied by yours, that I never felt it; but, my dear mama, why do you so often touch of late on this subject? You know it always makes you melancholy. —If my father were living, indeed!— but that is surely impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I know not of a certainty that he is dead; tho' I own 'tis most probable, as I learned he embarked for India near twelve years ago, and, as I before have told you, I have not once heard of him since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pity, Madam, you did not retain his name! for now, if even living, and anxious for re∣conciliation, his patience might be exhausted in fruit∣less inquiries after you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under the forgotten name of Wild∣man! True, Narcissa; but your rigid uncle, to whose kindness we are nevertheless indebted for our whole fortune, so highly resented your father's injurious usage of me, that he insisted on my renouncing the name, and, if possible, even the memory, of a man who had so cruelly wronged me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I have heard you say, my father was not altogether to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear Narcissa. It is the recol∣lection of the share I had in contributing to that fatal separation that distresses me. It is that which makes me look upon your union with Frederic Mel∣moth, under the most fearful apprehensions, lest a similar disposition to mine, shou'd make you fall into the same errors.—Good heav'n! what wou'd have become of us, if my relations, satisfied of the inno∣cence of my conduct, had not forgiven its absurdity, and continued their protection to me after the depar∣ture of Mr. Wildman!—unhappy Wildman! fond, frantic man!—And yet favoured as I have been ever by them, how have I since lived in the eye of the world!—in a state of solitary, neglected, doubtful widowhood!—I had once a son too, and you a bro∣ther; but whether he be living, or lost to us for ever, with his father, heav'n only knows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear mama, you now carry your surmises too far. You certainly do us wrong to in∣dulge your melancholy, as I my chearfulness.</P>

<P>I cannot help it, Narcissa. In you my hopes are now all centered. Let me not be deprived of the only comfort left me, in the prospect of your happiness.</P>

<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be assured, mama, that if it depend on me, you shall not. I will check the vivacity of my tem∣per, and be more on the reserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, my dear, and in return be assured, that I shall be no farther an advocate for lord Courtly, than his merit will justify. But you must excuse my still indulging a wish, that you had less partiality for young Melmoth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, he is possessed of so much goodness of heart, that I shou'd hope it out of his power to make a bad husband.</P>
</SP>

I should be glad to know how many cent. per-annum your modesty thinks necessary to the support of this fine character. It is not a month since you drew for the last five hundred, and now you are pressed for another.

<P>Excuse me, Sir; your worship seems to misunderstand us here a little. My master by no means intended you should take the trouble to stoop so low; he would not affront you so much, Sir.

</SP>

<P>Then I am not the first messenger of ill-news—you have heard of your father's death, I sup∣pose. But come, though it be an afflicting circum∣stance, you parted from him too early in life to feel much for his personal loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it; and had his fortune died with him, I shou'd have supported the loss of that too, with equanimity: but to receive such a cruel instance of his want of paternal regard, as that of bequeathing the whole of it away from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard nothing of this. — By a letter I re∣ceived from general Melmoth, a relation of your fa∣ther's, just now arrived from India, I learn that Sir John is dead; but nothing more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have learned much more. It seems, the late Sir John Melmoth, no long before his death, was married to a second wife, to whom he left his whole fortune.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but compose yourself. Things may not be so bad as you apprehend.—I expect the general himself hourly in Bath; who, I dare say, when he comes to know your real character, will, if things are thus circumstanced, be your friend. At worst, if you have a mind for the army, I will en∣gage, on my own interest, to set you presently at the head of a company. Then, Narcissa will have a handsome fortune; and I cannot suppose, after mat∣ters have been carried so far between you, that this accident will prove any obstacle to your marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is there, there, my dear colonel, I feel this reverse of fortune the most severely. For, though Narcissa should be too generous to reject me merely from mercenary motives, ought I to have less generosity than she? ought I to take the advantage of her partiality for me, to make a prey of her for∣tune, and permit her to throw herself away on a young fellow without a penny in his pocket, or a profession by which he might have the prospect of getting one? No, colonel, till I am master of a competency, at least equal to hers, I will relinquish my pretensions.—But when that may be, or what may happen in the interval! O colonel—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but no more of this. Why should you distress yourself at the doubtful consequences of perhaps an imaginary evil? I cannot help thinking you are under some mistake: but be it as it will, I will venture to answer for it Narcissa is still yours. Keep only this piece of information a secret from her, 'till it be farther confirmed. When I see you again, we may be able to judge of it, and proceed with more certainty.</P>

<P>Under correction, Sir; would it not be as well if she heard of it from somebody else? Or, if she never was to hear of it at all, I should think it might be better still. Narcissa is undoubtedly a worthy young lady: but I would not have you place too great a confidence on the generosity of the sex.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad, my dear colonel, to find you thus happily situated; and also to hear that Mr. Melmoth has merit enough to engage you so warmly in his favour. A young fellow capable of making such valuable friendships, can never be so bad as he has been represented. I own we had but very sorry accounts of my wild kinsman transmitted us to India.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Frederic, Sir, is young and vola∣tile; but having sense and principle, is in the way of reformation: for he has not only good qualites enough to make himself friends among the men, but to en∣gage the esteem of a young lady of the first distinc∣tion for personal merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am pleased to hear it. An amiable and virtuous monitor of the other sex is certainly the best reformer of ours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am no less pleased, for the sake of both, to find his father hath not left him destitute, as he hath been informed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet if lady Melmoth, his new mo∣ther-in-law, had not set out for England before Sir John's decease, that would probably have been the case; her ladyship having taken advantage of the boy's irregularities to get her husband to make his will intirely in her favour. Being no stranger how∣ever to her art and avarice, I prevailed on him to make a subsequent testament just before his death; by which the lady is more moderately provided for, and the bulk of his fortune more equitably left to his son. I am myself executor to this last will, and shall take a proper opportunity to undeceive the young man, as well as his father's agent; on whom I find
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
the widow hath greatly imposed, by means of the former will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>This will be most agreeable news to my young friend.—I am impatient to communicate it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your leave, colonel, I had rather that were deferred. I could not hope indeed to find a youth of his education and fortune as grave and pru∣dential as a rigid moralist; yet, having received such an indifferent impression of his character, I could wish to put his disposition a little to the proof. His pre∣sent mistake affords a favourable opportunity. I wou'd therefore have him kept a while in the dark, as to his real circumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will not that be cruel, general?—Consider the young gentleman's anxiety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; but he will be so much the happier for it when he comes to be undeceived. — Besides, I have my reasons; and you may depend on it, if he has real merit, the required delay will turn out to his advantage. It may be the means also of trying the disposition of his mistress; whom I should wish to have a disinterested regard for him. —If she loves him in spite of his supposed poverty, her constancy may be rewarded with a better fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, I shall be ruled by you, since you seem so much concerned for his welfare.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am indeed greatly concerned for it, colonel: for though I am but a distant relation to him, he is perhaps the nearest now living to me.— Besides, I am bound to it, in gratitude to his father; to whose friendship I was much indebted for my own success in life. Nay, I am not only obliged to Sir John Melmoth for my fortune, but even for his name; which I long ago assumed, on my departure from Europe.</P>

<P>What brought me hither, my lord! my own carriage, my lord, my own carriage, I assure you, ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, Mr. Lombard never travels in the stages, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never travel in the stages, my lord, except now and then to Hampstead or Camberwell, when my horses are out of order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Alderman, and pray what wind blew your carriage hither, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wind, my lord!—good again faith, very good indeed. It was a wind, my lord;—a whirlwind, my lord, a whirlwind! It took us up at Hyde-park-corner, and set us down here at the town's end.—Jehu, we came, envelop'd with clouds of dirt all the way.</P>

<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you were more tender of your horses, Mr. Lombard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, my lord, my own horses; but these were hacks, my lord, hacks! four legged machines, that are wound up every morning with a few oats and a whisp of hay, and set going along a turnpike∣road, with a boy on their backs all day, till, like a Dutch clock, they run themselves down at night. Why—why—some of our heathen philosophers say, we are not much better ourselves, my lord, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is Mr. Alderman's way, I presume, to be jocular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my lord, I hope no offence. I use no ceremony to be sure. And indeed, as Mr. deputy Purseproud says, a man that has the revenue of a Subah in his pocket, need not stand upon ceremony with any body but the Great Mogul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Mr. Alderman, therefore stand upon no ceremony with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't, my lord, I won't: for though your lordship may be a great man at court, I am a great man in the city: and the courtiers and citizens have always been upon a footing, to carry on a smuggling trade together. It has been the custom time out of mind, to make an exchange between your manners and our money, my lord; and egad you generally have had the better of the bargain too, let me tell you that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friend is quite a wit, Barrister. I did not think the spirit of raillery had been so prevalent within Temple-bar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my lord, there have been strange revo∣lutions of late in the city. The citizens have their wits and men of letters among them now a days, as well as the courtiers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Men of letters! ay, and letters of credit too, my lord; which is more than can be said by most of the literati at your end of the town. Yes,
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
my lord, and we have made great improvements in the arts, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I thought the city was always famous for the arts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the arts of pin-making and the ma∣nufacturing of thimbles, ha! ha! ha! No, my lad, no; these have been long ago trundled down in the broad-wheeled waggons to Birmingham; to make room for architecture, painting, paving, and sculp∣ture</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sculpture! Mr. Alderman! sure the grim savages at St. Dunstan's still stand centinel, to strike the hours on the clock!—Then the giants in Guild∣hall look as tremendous as ever? Gog and Magog are but bad proofs of your improved taste in sculp∣ture, Mr. Alderman. Those monuments of Gothic barbarism, shou'd be demolished before you set up for Virtù.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad that's true. I thank your lordship for the hint: they must come down. But you know my lord, Rome was not built in a day—but when I come to be lord-mayor, or get into parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>How Sir, not in parliament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is indeed a loss to our country, my lord: a man of Mr. Lombard's abilities cou'd not fail of making a shining figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very obliging, Mr. Furnival; but though I am not at present in the house, I hope, with yours and his lordship's assistance, I shan't be long out of it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>With my assistance, Mr. Alderman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, my lord, Mr. Lombard, has offered himself a candidate for the borough of Gluttonbury, in which I know your lordship has great interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are better acquainted with my interest than I am, Barrister.—I hope Mr. Lombard does not mean to solicit my influence.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad like enough: I'll leave you— <STAGE>[aside to <HI>Furnival</HI>]</STAGE>—Why, my lord, to be sure, I have but small pretensions; but, as a man who wou'd exert his utmost abilities in the service of his country, if your lordship shou'd think favourably of me, I shall be ready to fulfil any engagements Mr. Furnival may enter into in my behalf.—And so, my lord, your lordship's most obedient.— <STAGE>[Going, returns.]</STAGE> And, depend on't, my lord, that as soon as ever I come to the chair, or get into the house, I'll attack the giants.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! what a mixture of wit and absurdity! Prithee, Barrister, what do you mean by bringing me acquainted with this heterogeneous ani∣mal? You know I have no interest in his dirty bo∣rough of Gluttonbury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, my lord; but he does not know it: and as I am likely to reap some emolument from him myself, my regard for your lordship suggested a thought may possibly be agreeable to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take care, Furnival, of making my ho∣nour a cloak for your knavery: you have done it too often, even to the wearing it so threadbare, that, if I were not kept in countenance by the example of other persons of rank, I should be really ashamed of myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but the present expedient is an honour∣able one, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the first, then, of your suggesting, pray let us know what it is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will excuse me, my lord, if I am mis∣taken, as I don't mean to be impertinent: but I own I conceived, that either your lordship's constitution or estate might, by this time, have suggested the ex∣pediency of your entering again into the state of ma∣trimony. I took the liberty therefore to give a hint of your having such an intention to Mr. Lombard,
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
who has a marriageable daughter, with whom he seems disposed to give, at least, sixty thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; and so you would have me impose on him, as having influence enough to get him returned member, in order to prevail on him to accept me for a son-in-law! a very honourable ex∣pedient, truly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, my lord; as I dare say we shall be sure of carrying our election?—But I beg pardon if your lordship does not choose—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, Barrister, there are prudential reasons for my repairing my fortune with that of a wife; but so long as Narcissa keeps such hold of my heart, I can't resolve on making my addresses to any other women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought, my lord, that her avowed pre∣ference of a rival had determined you to think no more of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought so too: but I find my passion to be insuperable. At the same time her mother gives me encouragement: so that, till her hand be actually given to another, I cannot think of putting it out of my power to receive it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, my lord, my intention to oblige you is frustrated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Furnival, I stand in present need of your assistance. I want money, ready mo∣ney, to supply the common exigences of public places. My cursed ill luck has made a beggar of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alderman Lombard will furnish you with any sum you require.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid not. He knows better than to lend his money to a losing gamester, without more substantial security than I can easily give him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never sear, my lord: I will so manage him, that he shall be your spaniel, to fetch and carry, and lay down his bank-bills at your feet. Don't your lordship see that Mr. Lombard is a wit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you urge that as a proof of his folly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, my lord—When animals are once out of their element, their very strength degenerates into weakness. A man's forte becomes his foible. Now probity and plain common sense I take to be the proper element of worthy citizens and worshipful common-council-men; if any one of them soars, therefore, after artificial qualifications beyond those, he becomes like a bladder-blown fish, that floats on the surface of the water, till he is snapped up by a sea gull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, he is in good hands; but be sparing of him as you can.—You will let me know how you proceed.</P>

<P>A sudden surprize, Sift.—I thought I saw a gentleman, supposed to have been dead and buried many years ago.</P>

<P>Dead and buried, Ma'am! It must then have been his ghost.—Did I see it, Ma'am? I protest I begin to be surpriz'd too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mild. No, Sift, it was no ghost! the object I saw was certainly living;—his looks are hardly al∣tered; he is almost the same in appearance he was twelve years ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord, Ma'am, men are often so much alike in appearance, that we might be sadly deceived indeed, if we trusted to our eyes.—Besides, Ma'am, if he looks the same as he did twelve years ago, he must either be a ghost, or a sad cheat; for there must be a prodigious difference in him in reality.</P>

<P>Nay, I have not once set eyes on him to-day. Though to say the truth, Mamma, I believe I waited for him half an hour, or so, at lady Pedigree's; for, as I expected he would call there, I did not find myself hastily disposed to come away.</P>

<P>Indeed, indeed, Narcissa, I do require it: and if you have that sense of duty a fond mother could wish you to entertain, you will not think I lay you under any severe restraint.</P>

<P>Doth this new injunction proceed, madam, from the generally supposed want of discretion in me, or from any particular reason you may have to change your good opinion of Mr. Melmoth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps both. You must have heard, that Frederic hath been very wild; he left the uni∣versity at best but abruptly: then he plays deep; and it is very natural to suppose, he may have in∣trigues enough, to make it imprudent for a young woman to place too great a confidence in his profes∣sions of love.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reflect, and be well advised! What need of so much reflection and advice! My mamma hath surely met with something to ruffle her temper this morning. I protest she is quite peevish.—Not set my heart on Mr. Melmoth!—That advice comes now too late. Yet still she seems to allow him as much merit as any young gentleman of the age.— How unreasonable is this! If I am to be married at all, can I expect a better husband than the market affords? and if I am satisfied with my bargain, what is that to my mamma, I wonder! —Oh, here he comes!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think of it! Upon my word; I am full as much at loss what to think of it as you are. Sure the people are all at cross-purposes, or are eat up with the vapours this morning! My mama was here just now, and peevishly chid me forsooth, for being too kind to you: and now you come, in woful sadness

to complain of my cruelty! What, in the name of consistency, am I to do with you both?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't wonder, Narcissa, that your ma∣ma hath changed her thoughts of me. A reverse of fortune is with fathers and mothers a sufficient motive for a reverse of sentiments. But can they, whose vows have been reciprocally exchang'd, whose hearts have been once united; can they, my Narcissa, be ever divided from motives of sordid interest? What tho' my father be dead, and, through dotard fondness has reduced his son to beggary, I have still friends, real friends, able and willing to serve me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she must have heard it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt of it: and that accouuts for her behaviour.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> She may find, however, that people may sometimes be as much too reserved as too open.— <STAGE>[To Frederic.]</STAGE> But can it really be, Sir, as you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too certainly; though I received the news myself from my father's agent but this morning, and came directly to impart it to you.</P>

<P>It was Narcissa, though no human being had known it but myself. Thoughtless and indiscreet as I am, my heart is too faithful to you, and too just to the world, to suffer me to act the part of an impostor, a single moment. Nay, I come now with a design to relinquish my pretensions, 'till the happier circum∣stances
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
of some future day might entitle me to aspire to the heighth from which I am fallen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>To give up your pretensions, Mr. Mel∣moth! and was that so easy a task as to be readily resolved on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>However rashly resolved, you have seen it was not so easy to be executed. For what have I done but solicit for that, which I came to resign?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you would now marry me, notwith∣standing I may have fifteen thousand pounds to my fortune, and you, as you say, not a farthing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Narcissa!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you hesitate, do you?—To he sure there is some little inequality of condition in the case: but to let you see that I am more aspiring, I am ready to venture with you on the same terms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it possible you can be so good as to rate my merit above your fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, don't give me time to weigh one against the other. Money is heavy, and worth is light, you know: if you take me at my word, I shall keep it: but if I am left to cool and ponderate, I won't answer for myself.—Grave faces and good advice may have a strange effect upon me. At present, I say, I'll venture with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous Narcissa! But whether will you venture?</P>

<P>Spirited girl! charming Narcissa! but when?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, this very day, as soon as you please. My mama has dealt disingenuously by me. I will therefore beg leave of duty to stand aside a little, 'till I pay the debt I owe to love and honour. If it be a fault, I shall trust to her forgiveness this one time.— It is a fault one cannot make a practice of, you know.—So, come, let us go in, and concert proper measures for our expedition.</P>

<STAGE>Enter <HI>Syllogism.</HI></STAGE>
<P>So, so, so. I have been playing with a seeming dead coal, that hath been all the while burning my fingers. A plague of these potential cauteries, say I.—Sir John Melmoth, it seems, is really dead; my young master is a beggar, and I may carry his wallet. Sic transit gloria mundi! Had I thought the old baronet really defunct, I should not have been so pleasant with the young one's circumstances. But he is a deserving youth; and though I am horribly dis∣appointed in my own expectations, I declare I am Iess sorry for myself than for him.—What will be∣come of him!—For my own part I am qualified to struggle with the world.—Oh! here comes Sir Frederic—in a mighty good humour too! what the devil, sure his father's not come to life again!</P>
<STAGE>Enter Young <HI>Melmoth.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Syllogism, who hath called since. I have been out.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody, Sir;—I expected to have been able to present your honour with at least a hundred visit∣ing cards, full of compliments of condolance: but I find the world is not so impertinent; it civily chuses to leave people under misfortunes to comfort them∣selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the improved mode of good man∣ners, Syllogism, not to be troublesome. You seem, however, to stand in need of consolation! what's
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
the meaning of this? It is not above an hour or two ago since you braved the storns of fortune with the fortitude of a stoick, and recommended patience to me with the eloquence of a Seneca.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but, like Seneca too, I find I cou'd preach that to others which I cannot practice myself. But surely, Sir, I may conclude, from the pleasantry of your present disposition, that what you heard in the morning cannot be true!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>True! Syllogism. How shou'd it be true, when you know you observed it to be impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but Sir, joking apart, if your father be dead, how do you intend to live, now he has dis∣inherited you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall do the best: to supply my wants by industry. I shall find friends to put me in a way, and am only sorry it will be out of my power to reward your sidelity as it deserves</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, make yourself easy about me; a philosopher is easily provided for. Jacta est alea, Sir. When I have the misfortune to leave your service, I devote myself immediately to that of the muses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, turn poet! then art thou con∣demned to be poor as long as thou livest. Why, the poverty of poets, man, is notorious; it hath been a hackneyed jest for ages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, it hath been hackneyed so long, that it is fairly worn out. When poets had no patrons but the great, the poor devils, sure enough, were obliged to live upon little: but since the publick have taken them under their protection, a bard, like another man, may have two coats to his back, and every thing handsome about him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Syllogism, 'till the lawyers can decide the dispute about literary property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you, Sir, that a freehold on Parnassus does not intitle the possessor to vote for member of parliament; but let a man of genius once merit the
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
favour of the town, and he may levy contributions on it, whenever his affairs require it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Levy contributions! is not that too ar∣bitrary? I thought the convocation of criticks had something to do in the system of literary legislation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, they are the lower house, and have the privilege of deciding in all money-matters. They hold their sessions in the pit, at the representation of every new play, and proceed directly to the consider∣ation of ways and means.—To be sure, Sir, we can∣not raise a shilling without the consent of the house.—But if they approve the bill, they pass it with a plau∣dit, and their generosity is boundless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Syllogism, if you are obliged to go upon the town, I can only wish you success: but perhaps you may be better provided for, yet: in the mean time, you must not leave me abruptly—I shall want your service, for some time at least, I am going a journey of three hundred miles an end; will you go with me, if I should have occasion for you?</P>

<P>Te duce Teucro, to the antipodes, Sir.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither, Camply. I was married many years ago, and was too unhappy in that state, ever to think of entering into it again, even if I knew myself at liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard you had been married, general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, colonel, when I went over to India, I left a wife and infant daughter in England behind me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And are they living?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! heaven knows! I have heard no∣thing of them for years, except from the very man, of whom being absurdly jealous, I thought I had killed.—He came over with our troops some time ago to Bengal, and convinced me by a number of corroborating circumstances, that I had injured both him and my wife; but to my sorrow, he could give me no farther information of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>How fruitless then was that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fruitless as unhappy! for though my heart was something lighter, from knowing he had recovered of the wounds I had given him; yet I shou'd have much easier supported the reflection of having killed an adulterer, than that of having in∣jured, abandoned, and perhaps ultimately destroyed, am innocent wife and daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why destroyed? from this relation it is not impossible they may still be living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare not flatter myself with such a sug∣gestion. Nay, I hardly know whether I ought to wish it true: for if she lives, must she not long since have

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Perhaps in your long absence, thinking you were dead, she may have married again; and thus, by her change of name, have eluded your re∣searches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Melm.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be so, I will be no intruder on her happiness.—I will therefore carry on my future search in person; that, if I should succeed in it, I may be en∣abled to act as circumstances shall determine.

<P>Oh, yes; and he set out from thence, it seems, near a twelve month ago; but which road he took, or whether he is arrived at his journey's end, is at present a little problematical!</P>

<P>Pooh! I would not give a farthing to carry such letters. Sealed! What did you never open a letter without breaking the seal? Did you never take off the impression on wax, nor coax it with a hot to∣bacco pipe?</P>

<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mrs. Sift, they are arts I have not been bred to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, I have done it an hundred times, who was never bred to the arts at all: though I remem∣ber I once lost the best place I ever had in my life, for breaking open a letter, and sealing it up again with my thimble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And deservedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I paid for my peeping that time, it's true; but I should have done it, had I been to die for it. I am astonished to think how any body can have so little curiosity, as not to long to know every thing that other people want to keep from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>

<P>I would as soon put my hand into my master's purse, as pry into his secrets; and think a servant deserves to be hanged as much for the one as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, if it be done with intent to betray them, Mr. Syllogism; but otherwise—and yet, to be sure, one does sometimes do a deal of mischief by getting into secrets by halves; but that is the fault of one's masters and mistresses, you know, in not trusting us with the whole.—You will not pretend to tell me, however, that you have no curiosity to know your master's business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syllog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith I have no curiosity to know more than he thinks proper to intrust me with. I have plague and trouble enough with that; if I knew less, I should live a much easier life: for what between his money-matters and those of his mistress, which you know, Sift, are both ticklish affairs, I have but a very troublesome time on't.</P>
<STAGE>[While Syllogism is speaking, Sift is looking at the letter, and turning it about in her hand.</STAGE>

<P>There must be something very curious, Syl∣logism, in this letter. It is doubled into so many pleats, and folded up as carefully as the Welch-man's guinea—there is certainly something choice in it.</P>

<P>Therefore I am afraid, Narcissa, she has some better reasons for her sudden change of behaviour than you are aware of: at least I shou'd be for com∣ing to a farther explanation with her before I took so irretrievable a step as you are going inconsiderately to do.</P>

<P>Oh! my dear, we shall take a great many steps before we get to Scotland. We shall not be across the Tweed so soon as we might be at the next parish church.

<P>Not unless he refuses to give it you; there is no occasion for't, my dear. But if by a proper re∣gard, you mean that the colonel is in possession of your heart, I warrant your hand will soon follow.

<P>Perhaps not— but I feel an invincible re∣luctance to the making my addresses elsewhere. It is

true; Narcissa herself gives me no encouragement; but her mother is still my friend, and affords me hopes that something may turn out in my favour: I have even just now received a message from her, desir∣ing to see me in the evening, on particular business.— Who knows what may have happened?

<P>Positively, my dear Sophia.—I shall not break my word with Mr. Melmoth, if he keep his with me. We are to have your colonel's chaise wait∣ing for us at the town's end. I shall just go to the rooms with you for form's sake, and see you set in for cards, and then vanish; slip into a chair, and be with my spark in a twinkling: leaving you, my dear, or your colonel, to make the best apology you can for me to my mama.—I have left a short one indeed myself in a letter she will find on her return in the evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you have made me your confident, my dear, I shall not betray you. But I cannot say I ap∣prove of this step. Indeed I really think it unneces∣sary. I am certain your mama might be brought to give her consent to your marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then there is the less harm, my dear, in going to be married without it. If she has no ob∣jections, you know, but what might be removed by solicitation, the solicitation would be merely a matter of form, a piece of childish ceremony.—Besides, my dear Sophy, to answer all your petty scruples about disobedience at once, I am determined on the thing precisely, because I would not be disobe∣dient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; make that out, Narcissa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very plainly.—My mama has not yet positively told me she would not have me marry Mr. Melmoth:—on the contrary, she has hitherto encouraged his addresses: but as I shrewdly suspect she might tell me so in plain terms the next time we converse on the subject, I don't intend to give her an opportunity of laying me under any such injunction. —Because, in that case, you know, it would be

No, no, my pretty flut∣terer, you must not take flight, and leave us yet, neither.—What if I worked by stratagem, and en∣trapped my little lapwing in her own snare!— Her chairmen may possibly be prevailed on to mistake the place of rendezvous.—If I can but decoy her to his lordship's apartments, he may set her at liberty himself, if he chuses it.

<P>By the lady's mother, Sir; who, being early informed of their intention, was by the aid and advice of lord Courtly at the place of rendezvous be∣fore they set off. For my own part, apprehensive that my assistance would be called for, I purposely kept out of the way.</P>

<P>And how takes my kinsman his rival's in∣terposition in this affair? Have you seen him to day?</P>
</SP>

<P>Just now; and horribly mortified at his disappointment, I assure you. He had just dispatch'd a note to lord Courtly.</P>

<P>I don't see how Mr. Melmoth can recede, general; he must call his lordship to account for his last night's misbehaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you may be his second, colonel, and prolong the ceremonials 'till I have had some talk with the young lady's mother. I promised yes∣terday to endeavour to conciliate matters with her re∣lations, had she gone off with my kinsman to Scot∣land;
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
I can do no less than try how far my influence may extend now. If Mrs. Mildmay's objections to young Melmoth be merely founded on his supposed want of fortune, they are readily obviated; and if lord Courtly be as you say, a man of sense and principle, he will give up the point; and no longer endeavour to divide two young people, whose hearts seem form'd for each other. O! here comes Mr. Alderman Lombard.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had a meeting with him last night, to settle the affair of my executorship; when I took an opportunity to mention yours with his daughter, Sophia; as also your electioneering business; in which he does not meet with the encouragement he expected; so that you may not find him so refractory as you imagined.—I have taken some steps towards your reconciliation.</P>

<STAGE>Enter Mrs. <HI>Mildmay</HI> and <HI>Sift.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sift, and can you learn whether the story Mr. Melmoth hath told Narcissa be true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>O lord, Madam, it is exactly as I guess'd yesterday. What Mr. Melmoth told Narcissa, Mr. Syllogism told me; but I knew it was a sib the mo∣ment I heard it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how are you assur'd of it to∣day!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>From colonel Camply's own mouth, madam; who call'd me into the parlour this morning, and be∣gan to catechise me like a school-master. Mrs. Sift, says he, what makes you abroad so early? What, your ladies have sent you out upon the enquiry, I suppose, I know they are curious and inquisitive.—Indeed, Sir, says I, you know no lady in our house half so inquisi∣tive as myself. Well, says he, what's the news then, at home? Why, Sir, says I, we hear that Mr. Mel∣moth's father is dead, and has disinherited him.— Disinherited him! says he, an idle story, Sift, an idle story, there is nothing in it.—So I thought, an please your honour, said I, for I understood Mr. Melmoth was son to the strange gentleman who visited you yesterday. Ay, Sift, says he, while that gentleman lives, Mr. Melmoth's fortunes are in the hands of a father.—Oh, ma'am, I'm positively certain it is as I first suggested.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then so far all is well; but did you learn nothing more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, ma'am; you wanted to know if the gentleman was married or not: but that seems to be a doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A doubt! Did colonel Camply say it was a doubt!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; madam, I did not think that a proper question to put to the colonel. But Mrs. Tiptoe, his honour's house-keeper, with whom I had a little confab afterwards, over-heard the gentleman tell her master yesterday that he was married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then is it a doubt?— <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> Oh no! my fears are true, and I must still be wretched.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it seems, madam, the gentleman has lost his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lost her! How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, ma'am, I know nothing more than that he can't find her; so that at least she is lost to him. He has not seen her, I find, these twelve years past though, by his own account, which is a little extra∣ordinary, he has been looking for her almost from one end of the world to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heavens! my hopes revive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sift.</SPEAKER>
<P>The colonel, advises him, if he don't find her soon, to look out for another: but he is one of your constant swains it seems; and declares, that if his first love cannot be found, she shall certainly be his last.— Whether the gentleman will keep his word or not, is another affair. But this is all I could learn of the matter, madam, as it stands at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied. <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE> Is he then true to one he thought unfaithful? and can he still remem∣ber me with tenderness? <STAGE>[to Sift.]</STAGE> Go, leave me, Sift; I see Narcissa coming.—</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Sift.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Narcissa.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Well, Narcissa, I hope, that, on reflection, you are convinc'd of the danger and impropriety of your be∣haviour. Think, my dear, into what frightful perils your indiscretion had betray'd you. Believe me, child, such unadvis'd proceeding, differs little from wilful disobedience.—</P>
<SP>
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, I shudder at the reflection, and am hardly recover'd from the terrour into which your relation had thrown me.—But, with regard to Mr. Melmoth's affinity, how was it possible for me, to have any suspicion of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>It certainly was not: but, in a matter of so much importance, you should not have acted so precipitately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor should I, mama, had not you been so much on the reserve, and spoken of Mr. Melmoth so disrespectfully yesterday morning.—But, for the fu∣ture, I am all obedience.—How would you have me behave to him now?—as you said so little to him last night, he will undoubtedly make me a visit this morn∣ing. —How am I to resist his solicitations, without giving him my reasons for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot you turn the conversation on another subject? I shall now very soon come to an ex∣planation with your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father! madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Narcissa, that long-lost father, whom you have heard me so often lament, is now in Bath. I saw him yesterday by accident, and to-day in∣tend to procure an interview; which should have been over, before I had imparted this circumstance, had not your last night's adventure anticipated the dis∣covery of Mr. Melmoth's being your brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, is it not strange, madam, that he should say nothing to me of his father's arrival? But, on the contrary, should tell me he was dead, and had disin∣herited him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot divine his reasons for such be∣haviour. But, men in love, Narcissa, are strange creatures. He might do it, possibly, to make a trial of your regard for him.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must have been a scheme sure to mislead me into that dangerous project of elopement, which might have prov'd so fatal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>It might be so; and therefore it would not be amiss, my dear, if you affect to resent it as such; nay, I would have yon do it, were it only to give a preparatory check to his passion, before he knows that you're his sister. It will be improper for me to see him yet, as well in regard to what has pass'd, as to the danger of betraying a mother's affection too soon. I must speak first with your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what a situation then, madam, do you leave your Narcissa? Is it for me to act so hard a part? Can I affect to treat with disregard, the man so late I lov'd? Alas! I find his image wanting here. The. void it left, no brother can supply.—Oh! my poor heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that very reason, Mr. Melmoth, may it not be as well we were prevented?—What! to be tied together for life! never to be parted! Might we not, in time, have been tir'd of one another; and, after that, have been most disagreeable companions?</P>

<P>And you are really glad we were prevented going to Scotland to be married? Surely you dissem∣ble with me?</P>

<P>Not in that, believe me, Sir.—I would not have gone off with you to Scotland, and been married to you, for the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then there is a change indeed.—But, for heaven's sake, why? What can have work'd this astonishing alteration? What have I done, or said, or thought? How am I chang'd, that such a change should have happened in you? Some villain, envious of my happiness, must have unjustly traduc'd, and blacken'd my reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, something has been said of you, it must be confess'd. But it was so far from be∣ing to your disadvantage, that, had I never had any knowledge of you before, it would have induc'd me to love and esteem you as a brother.—But, with re∣gard to your own behaviour to me, Mr. Melmoth, I

<P>Is it possible you can think so? Then must I have been misinform'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will excuse me, Sir; but my mama hath fully convinc'd me, that my intended marriage with Mr. Melmoth, would have been highly improper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Improper!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dreadful!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me, madam.—Dreadful! What new folly hath he committed, then? to what baseness descended, that should make an alliance with him deserving such an epithet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't mistake me, Sir;—I have still the highest esteem for Mr. Melmoth; but my mama—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Objects to his want of fortune; I know it. But if I convince her she is mistaken.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet even then, Sir, notwithstanding the sincere regard I still entertain for Mr. Melmoth, and the great respect which, though a stranger, I feel for yon, I could not be induc'd to listen to the solicitations of either.—No, Sir, I never can marry any man who calls you father.—But I can explain myself no far∣ther. My mama is, by this time, disengag'd, and will herself attend you.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<P>What is all this? Respect for me!—not marry any man who calls me father!—I am not young

</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. <HI>Mildmay.</HI> [Who stands at a distance, and looks at him with tenderness.]</STAGE>
<P>I beg pardon, madam, but— <STAGE>[bowing ceremoniously, and advancing, 'till looking full in her face, he retreats slowly back.]</STAGE> Sure—that face—I—</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Wildman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her voice too!—Gracious powers!—It is —'tis she—it is—it is—my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I am your wife, your once be∣loved wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And still belov'd!—Come to my arms, thou long-lost, injur'd woman.— <STAGE>[they meet and em∣brace.]</STAGE> Oh, my wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And art thou still my husband?—I thought thou hadst forgotten me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgotten thee! Oh, never, never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hast thou forgiven me too?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgiven thee, love!—Why, thou didst never wrong me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I did not; even when you thought me guilty, I was innocent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know thou wast; and 'tis in knowing that, that I've so long been wretched.—Yes, thou wast in∣nocent; but it was I, 'twas I, forgot the father and the husband, and wrong'd both thee and thine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, I was indiscreet, and much to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Idle recrimination! no; you never were to blame—and yet, your name is Mildmay.</P>
<STAGE>[Turning from her.</STAGE>

<P>Nay, turn not from me—I perceive your doubts; but they are vain and groundless; my name's assum'd like thine.—For your embraces

form'd, and yours alone, these have been widow'd arms e'er since you lest me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My faithful wife! Come then again to mine, and dwell for ever there.</P>
<STAGE>[Embracing.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, my love, this meeting's like a vision. You seem as one new risen from the dead.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the re-union of departed souls, favour'd by heav'n to meet again above, with joy unut∣terable.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! let us, then, thank heav'n for such a meeting.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot thank it better than I do. Heav'n knows the heart; and, from the fulness of my pre∣sent joy, sees mine o'erflow with gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Narcissa.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Narcissa, come, and take a father's blessing.</P>
</SP>

<P>Is this my daughter too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! my father.</P>
<STAGE>[Kneeling.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, but need not, bless thee. Heaven hath been so much kinder to thee than thy father.</P>
<STAGE>[Raises her up, and embraces her.</STAGE>

<STAGE>Enter young <HI>Melmoth.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome, my Frederic, to a mother's arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you, then, give your daughter to my wishes? Thus let me thank you for the precious gift. — <STAGE>[Kneeling, and kissing Mrs. Midmay's hand; then rising and turning to Narcissa.]</STAGE>—But will Narcissa ratify the grant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[In a tone of great concern.]</STAGE>
<P>Indeed, brother— I know not what to say.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother! Narcissa!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whence this mistake?— <STAGE>[to Mrs. Mildmay.]</STAGE> We have alas! no son: our Frederic died, poor boy, long since, in India.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild</SPEAKER>
<P>Then have my hopes and fears alike been fruitless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside, in a tone of joy and surprize.]</STAGE>
<P>—Again I feel my swelling heart replete.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! what!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you are not my brother then at last?</P>
<STAGE>[To Young Melmoth.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your brother, Narcissa! No; dear as I might love a sister, I would not be your brother for the world. I see through the whole of your strange behaviour now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[To Mrs. Mildmay.]</STAGE>
<P>—This young gentle∣man, my dear, is son to a distant relation lately dead: to whose fortune he is heir, and to whose last will I am executor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hoity toity! here's a tangled skain un∣ravell'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>—And general Melmoth is Nar∣cissa's father!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter lord <HI>Courtly,</HI> introduc'd by servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Courtly, madam.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Serv.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen your servant. Hap∣pily assembled, I hope.—[turning to Young Melmoth.]— I presume, Mr. Melmoth is, by this time, convinc'd of the impropriety of the angry billet he sent me this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mistake we both lay under, my lord, at once justifies your behaviour and my resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortunately for me, however, that mistake drew a promise from the amiable Narcissa; which, I flatter myself, she is too generous to forget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, my lord, I did promise to give you my hand, if Mr. Melmoth could not accept it: and, if you had come some few minutes ago, I should have been terribly puzzl'd what to say to you. But I can now keep my word, without your reaping any advantage from my promise.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam! Mrs. Mildmay, what have I to hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my lord, my present perplex∣ity of joy and surprize, makes me as incapable of ex∣pressing my obligations, as the event puts it out of my power to requite them. Narcissa is not Mr. Mel∣moth's sister; but, instead of a brother, she hath found a father, and I a husband; to whose guidance and protection we now are subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your leave then, madam, Mr. Mel∣moth shall be yet your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then have I found, instead of lost, a father.</P>
<STAGE>[Bowing to general Melmoth, who advances to embrace him.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mild.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the preference I once gave your lordship—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>It lays me under an obligation, madam, that, in the present circumstances, makes all apology needless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Narc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generously said; is not it, Mr. Melmoth? —Indeed, my lord, I wish you a better wife than I should have made you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I you, madam, all happiness, with a husband that deserves you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall endeavour to merit the compliment, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter alderman <HI>Lombard,</HI> colonel <HI>Camply</HI> and <HI>Sophia.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, gentlemen and ladies. You seem to be mighty well pleas'd here: my daughter Sophy and the colonel have let me a little into some∣thing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Camply! oh, my friend, behold my injur'd, much-wrong'd wife and daughter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, how! the widow Mildmay general Melmoth's wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you're fill'd with wonder! I could indeed, relate a tale most wonderful, but that excess of joy prevents its utterance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, we'll wait, general, 'till you are a little more sorrowful.—In the mean time, I must in∣form you, that I have settled matters with your friend Camply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lomb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, my daughter and the borough go together. There, take her, colonel; and make her just as good a husband as she proves a wife—for my own part, I shall defer my matrimonial project to another opportunity: and, I think, it would not be amiss if his lordship follows my example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I hope I shall always have generosity of temper enough, to rejoice in the happiness of others, though not directly conducive to my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such a disposition, my lord, cannot go long unrewarded. Your lordship will do me honour in permitting me to cultivate a farther acquaintance with it. But, from the events of to-day, we may see how ineffectual are all attempts to separate those whom love hath united, and heaven preserv'd for each other.</P>
