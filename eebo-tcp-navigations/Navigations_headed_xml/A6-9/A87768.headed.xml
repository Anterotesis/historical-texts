<HEAD>The Causes of the Publick Hatred of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish Nation.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The hatred of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> towards the Protestants, and their Religion.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O shun the suspition of fancy∣ing to write <HI>Iliads</HI> after <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI> I will not now make a large Martyrologie, which of it self, were enough to fix a Title to this Chapter; nor will I compile Histories of the <HI>Belgick,</HI> or Low-Country War, especially of that which was waged by the Duke of <HI>Alva;</HI> for those are both sufficiently known, and there is store of them to be had. This I shall only say, and this for their sakes, who think the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will prove milder to them, because they imagine to them∣selves, that they are included in the Paci∣fication
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> of Religion (they who are com∣monly called by the envious name of <HI>Cal∣vinists</HI> being excluded) then to the <HI>Refor∣mats,</HI> as they term them; that they are superlatively mistaken. For whosoever they be that differ in opinion from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whether in matter of Religion, or in order to their long-dream'd of <HI>Mo∣narchy,</HI> are all alike to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The cruelty which the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> exercised upon them of the <HI>Reformed Re∣ligion</HI> in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> is notorious enough; yea, and himself, a little before his end, boasted, <HI>that by his command above eighteen thousand persons passed through the hands of the Executioner, with different sorts of punishments, for Religions sake.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Philip</HI> the second, freely and boldly answered the Emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> his Cousin-German by the Fathers-side (who, having sent his Brother <HI>Charles</HI> in∣to <HI>Spain</HI>) exhorted him to moderation in the business of Religion, <HI>That he had ra∣ther lose all his Provinces, then seem to grant, or favour any thing, which might be prejudicial to the Catholick Religion.</HI> Thuan. lib. 133.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Pacification of <HI>Colein,</HI> 1580. were wont to say, <HI>That
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> the Protestants would be well served, if they were stript of all their goods, and for∣ced to go seek new Countries, like</HI> Jews, Egyptians <HI>and</HI> Nubians, <HI>who wander up and down like Rogues and Vagabonds, with∣out any place of abode.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Citizens of <HI>Aquensis</HI> had been much more mildely dealt with in the year, 1605 had it not been for the importunate flatteries of King <HI>Philips</HI> Embassadors, as <HI>Thuan.</HI> testifyes, <HI>lib.</HI> 133.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> once took the <HI>French</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Florida,</HI> and hanged them all with this title, <HI>This I do not as to</HI> French, <HI>but as to</HI> Lutherans. <HI>Camer. horis subcessivis,</HI> c. 98.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the year 1577. when by the Em∣perors demand, there was a Conference appointed between the Kings Ministers, and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> the said Mini∣sters urged only this, <HI>That the liberty of any other Religion whatsoever might be excluded out of the Low-Countries, and the Catholick only admitted,</HI> which was the cause of dis∣solving the Conference, <HI>re infectâ.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Ought the Count of <HI>Bructerons</HI> ca∣lamity to be silenced, whose Castle the Admiral unjustly, and violently seized up∣on, took his person prisoner, ejected his
<PB N="4" REF="7"/> wife and children, plundred his goods, kil∣led the Countrymen whom he found there, yea, and wickedly murthered the very Count himself, together with his Kinsman, and a Preacher, contrary to his word which he had given them; and this for no other colour, but out of hatred to the Reformed Religion, which he most constantly profest, and from which he would not be removed by any menaces whatsoever. See <HI>Speculum Arragonicum,</HI> as also <HI>Speculum Tragicum.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the year 1590. the 8. of <HI>March,</HI> made a Procla∣mation at <HI>Madrid,</HI> wherein he declared, that after <HI>France</HI> was cleared, he would make War upon all such Provinces as were infected with any Sectarian Conta∣gion. <HI>Ancellus apud Thuan.</HI> lib. 118. <HI>in oratione ad Principes Germaniae,</HI> 1570. where the words of the Proclamation are also recited.</P>
<P N="9">9. If there were no other example to be found of the Spanish hatred against the Gospel and Gospellers, that most cruel Fact of <HI>Alphonso Dias,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> would suffice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ex∣ample of <HI>Dias.</HI></NOTE> who caused his brother <HI>Juan Dias</HI> to be killed by his own Executioner, because he embraced the Doctrine of the
<PB N="5" REF="7"/> Gospel, in the year 1546. and however the Law were prosecuted against the said Fratricide, he yet obtained his Pardon by the intervention of the Emperours Let∣ters.</P>
<P N="10">10. The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by his Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> urged the Senate of <HI>Aquensis,</HI> to banish them of the Reformed Religion out of the City, as <HI>Peter Beck</HI> a Canon of that City confesses, cap. 13. <HI>Comment. sui de urbe Aquensi.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Cardinal <HI>Granvellanus</HI> was often wont to boast, that he would reduce the Catholick Religion in all places, though a hundred thousand men were to be burnt in an hour, and that he would begin with <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Orange.</HI> See <HI>Gaspar Grevinus, in sua Institutione,</HI> p. 192.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> the second, most faithfully advised, and in∣treated the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to treat the <HI>Flemmings</HI> more gently in matter of Re∣ligion, but he could obtain nothing, as himself writes in a certain Letter of his to <HI>Lazarus Swendius,</HI> 1579. the 22. of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> from <HI>Vienna.</HI> This Letter is to be read, <HI>lib.</HI> 16. <HI>Apoph. Baudartii.</HI> See also <HI>Speculum tyrannidis Hispanicae in Belgio per totum.</HI></P>
<P N="13"><PB N="6" REF="8"/>13. And who ever either saw, or heard of a greater fact of barbarous tyrannie, and hatred against Religion, then that which by the instinct of some ill Instru∣ments, the <HI>Archduke</HI> Albert <HI>committed, in a certain Maid called</HI> Anne Vandenho∣ven <HI>at</HI> Brussels, <HI>whom he caused to be set quick in earth, and smothered? Martyro∣logium, Meteranus, Speculum Hisp. Tyran. in Belgio.</HI> p. 91, 93.</P>
<P N="14">14. It may also be a most sufficient te∣stimony of the hatred of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against the <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> (and chiefly the later) that when they have a mind to dishonour any one very much, or call him by any injurious name, they call him, <HI>Vellaco Lutherano,</HI> i. e. <HI>Lutheran Knave;</HI> so that even by this reproach they who are willing, and glad to be stiled <HI>Lu∣therans,</HI> may be sufficiently taught, what they are to hope for from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when the Protestants are supprest (who are as much oppugned by others, as by the Papists) to wit, that they shall be served with the same sawce.</P>
<P N="15">15. When, after the <HI>Smalcaldick</HI> war, and the taking of <HI>John Frederick,</HI> Elector of <HI>Saxony, Wittenberg</HI> was yielded to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> petitioned
<PB N="7" REF="8"/> the said <HI>Charles,</HI> to give them leave to dig up the dead body of <HI>Luther,</HI> and burn it; but the Emperor refused it, saying, <HI>Let him rest; for if he hath done ill, God will revenge it: I am Emperor of the living, and not of the dead.</HI> He further added, <HI>Let him alone, I desire to see him no more; for I saw him enough at</HI> Worms. <HI>Zingrefius</HI> p. 2. Apoph. p. 11.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, presently after the Dyet of <HI>Auxburgh,</HI> ought to have surprized and opprest the Hereticks, &amp; <HI>Lu∣ther</HI> by Art, under some other pretext. See <HI>Thomas Campanella,</HI> a Spanish Fryar, <HI>Dis∣cursu de Monarchia Hisp.</HI> c. 16.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>In the first place it was an extream error, to let Luther go off alive, from the Dyets of</HI> Wormes <HI>and</HI> Auxburgh: And then, it was indeed well done of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth (I say) to keep his word with <HI>Luther,</HI> whilest he was at the Dyet; but afterwards, in his going home, he should have surprized him, and after having al∣ready supprest the Protestant Princes, have utterly extinguisht them. The same <HI>Campanella,</HI> c. 27.</P>
<P N="18">18. That Peace was to be granted for a time, and sometimes the Hereticks (says <HI>Campanella</HI>) were to be flattered with
<PB N="8" REF="9"/> magnificent banquets, <HI>c.</HI> 27. And besides it was an error in <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth (says the same <HI>Campanella</HI>) that he did not sup∣press the Countreys of the Electors of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and of the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>Hassia,</HI> &amp;c. by thrusting out the Inhabitants, and making them slaves, and planting new Colonies therein, and depriving the <HI>Free Cities</HI> of their Privi∣ledges, <HI>c.</HI> 16. These things may also be re∣ferred to the 22. chap. of the hatred of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> towards the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. It is also shewed by the same Au∣thor, <HI>c.</HI> 1. to what end the <HI>Goths, Italians,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> together, ought to conspire against them (<HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Ger∣many</HI>) utterly eradicate their Sects after having subdued them, and place new Co∣lonies in their stead.</P>
<P><HI>Thuanus,</HI> lib. 28 in his History <HI>De Con∣cilio Possiaceno in Gallia,</HI> shews, that the hatred of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against the Refor∣med Religion, is more then <HI>Odium Vati∣nianum.</HI></P>

<P>IT may chance to seem strange to thee Reader, that in the <HI>Catalogue of the</HI> Spanish <HI>Praevarications,</HI> amongst all the Powers and Kingdoms of the world, the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> should also come into the number, yea, and that in the second place, and as it were in the Front. But thou must know, that such is the ambition of this Nation, and the conception of its <HI>Mo∣narchy,</HI> that they cannot forbear <HI>their most Holy Father,</HI> when there is question of their own ends, having no respect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Holiness, nor considering at all, that he uses to stile them, his most <HI>Catholick,</HI> most <HI>Beloved,</HI> and <HI>First begotten sons:</HI> And this is the very cause, why I thought fit to put, and shew the Spanish Praevari∣cations against his Holiness in this second place.</P>
<P>Let my kinde Reader therefore know, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> at the choosing of a new <HI>Pope,</HI> employ all their studies and la∣bours,
<PB N="10" REF="10"/> that either a <HI>Spaniard</HI> by birth, or a Favourer of the Spanish Party, may be elected: This may be shewed by many examples, and first in the year 1591. when after the Death of <HI>Pope Ʋrban</HI> the 7th. there grew a great contention amongst the Cardinals about a Pope; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> desiring, forsooth, one who was a sworn friend to their Party; yea, and they at length prevailed for the Election of <HI>Ni∣cholas Sfondrato,</HI> a most sworn Crony of theirs. <HI>Thuanus.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The same thing hapned in the year 1592. after the death of <HI>Innocent</HI> the 9th. when the Free Election was again hindred by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> through the assistance of <HI>Ludovico Madrucus,</HI> who was of their party; and when <HI>Antonio de Columna,</HI> King <HI>Philips</HI> Embassador, went into the Conclave himself, with resolution, that before the said Conclave were shut, <HI>An∣tonio Sanctio</HI> should be nominated, and created <HI>Pope;</HI> and yet he was stoutly op∣posed by <HI>Francisco Sfortia,</HI> and <HI>Columnio Sfortia,</HI> who threatned and prepared force against force, and added, <HI>that before that should be, blood should be seen run out of the Conclave, down the stairs to St.</HI> Peters <HI>Church.</HI> Many reproaches were thrown
<PB N="11" REF="10"/> upon <HI>Sanctio;</HI> and the Cardinals being di∣vided, grew into a long dispute, till yet at length, by the intervention of some pecu∣niary corruptions from the Spanish Facti∣on, <HI>Hippolito Aldobrandino</HI> was elected Pope. <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 103.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> at present, by their Factions, reign in the Popes Court; and however they make not what Popes they will (because their too much greatness is much suspected) yet do they hinder such as they will not have by their ambitious Courtships, from rising to that dignity: and they of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> are in such a degree of favour at <HI>Rome,</HI> that it is believed by the <HI>Senate</HI> of the <HI>Holy See,</HI> that the conservation of Religion, and the dignity of the said <HI>See,</HI> depends upon them. <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 134. Therefore, after the death of <HI>Clement</HI> the 5th. the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> fearing least Noble Cardinal <HI>Caesar Baronius,</HI> the writer of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Annals,</HI> should be chosen Pope, revoked a complaint, which was begun against him during the life of the said <HI>Clement,</HI> by certain Letters supposed to be written by <HI>Lorenzo Suarez Figuera</HI> Duke of <HI>Feria,</HI> and <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> brought into the Congregation by <HI>Ptolemaeo Gallo</HI> Cardinal
<PB N="12" REF="11"/> of <HI>Coma,</HI> and Dean of the Colledge, and recited by <HI>Don Francisco Mexia Avila,</HI> a Spanish Cardinal, because they were writ∣ten in that language: at the reading where∣of <HI>Baronius,</HI> who was present, was not a little troubled, and taking his grounds (af∣ter his fashion) out of the holy Scripture, suddenly answered,
<Q><L>Et melius est mihi mori, quàm ut eva∣cuetur gloria mea;</L></Q>
<Q><L>It is better for me to die then lose my honour.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now there was a place in the eleventh Book of his <HI>Annals,</HI> where he had writ∣ten, <HI>that the Right, which the Kings of Spain claim to themselves in the Monarchy of</HI> Sicilie, <HI>was grounded upon false and suspected testimonies,</HI> &amp;c. See <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 134. and though <HI>Baronius</HI> excused him∣self, yet afterwards, when his Works were Printed at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> the eleventh Tome was prohibited, and those Copies which were set forth at <HI>Rome,</HI> were also prohibi∣ted in the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Territories.</P>
<P N="4">4. The stupidity of some Catholicks is to be wondred at, who refuse to do no∣thing in favour of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when in the mean while, nothing is more familiar to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> then to make a stalking horse of the very <HI>Pope</HI> himself, as it clear∣ly
<PB N="13" REF="11"/> appears in the Controversie of <HI>Portu∣gal, An.</HI> 1579. when the Pope, by <HI>Phi∣lippo Sega,</HI> his then Embassador with King <HI>Philip,</HI> willing to interpose his Authority, and desiring that the composure of the business between him and <HI>Henry</HI> might be referred to his arbitration; King <HI>Philip,</HI> at first, by the advice of <HI>Juan de Sylva,</HI> made a shew of relishing the <HI>Popes</HI> kind∣ness very well; and till he had transacted with <HI>Henry,</HI> baffled <HI>Sega</HI> with various shifts and protractions, <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 69.</P>
<P N="6">6. But was not <HI>Rome</HI> it self taken, pil∣laged, and vext the Pope, and Clergy for∣ced to yield themselves in the <HI>Capitol,</HI> and then to ransom themselves with a huge summ of money, (<HI>viz.</HI> Four hundred thou∣sand Ducats in gold) besides a certain gra∣tulatory coyn, which was made with this Motto, <HI>In spem prisci honoris? Luckius,</HI> p. 64. And this was the fourteenth seizure of that City. <HI>Erasmus</HI> in his Epist. 26. lib. 22. says, <HI>that Pope</HI> Clement <HI>was most inclemently treated.</HI> The Emperour in∣deed excused himself, that it was done without his knowledge; but it is ordinary with the Spanish Nation, either to deny their wicked actions, or to stuff and palliate them with specious pretences.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="14" REF="12"/>7. That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do not much va∣lue the Pope of <HI>Romes</HI> authority, if by any means they could work their ends other∣wise, it is apparent by that war, which the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> in his Kings name, waged against his Holiness in <HI>Italy,</HI> 1556. of which, <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 17. &amp; 18. where it is related, how the said Duke had a designe to take <HI>Rome</HI> it self.</P>
<P N="8">8: When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had pulled <HI>Pe∣rez</HI> out of the Church wherein he had ta∣ken Sanctuary, the Popes <HI>Nuncio,</HI> for the maintenance of the Priviledges of the Church, urged that the said <HI>Perez</HI> might be restored to the Church from whence he was taken, but could effect nothing. See <HI>In relatione rerum Perezii,</HI> p. 31.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Vice King of <HI>Sicily</HI> or <HI>Naples,</HI> put to death a certain Nobleman of that Kingdom, a Kinsman of the Popes, not∣withstanding the Popes intercession.</P>
<P N="9">9. How the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gulled the Cen∣sure of Pope <HI>Ʋrban</HI> the 8th. against <HI>Poza</HI> the Jesuit, <HI>Alphonso de Vergas</HI> in his relation teaches at large. See also the Appendix to that relation.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Thomas Campanella</HI> a Spanish Do∣minican Fryer, in his <HI>Discourse of the Spa∣nish Monarchy,</HI> cap. 6. says, <HI>We must
<PB N="15" REF="12"/> labour to get a Spanish Pope, or rather one of the house of</HI> Austria.</P>
<P N="11">11. That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> bear not that reverence, and respect which they pretend, to the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> but abuse his Authority for their own Interest, is clear enough out of <HI>Ancellus,</HI> in his Speech which he made to the Princes of the Empire, 1597. <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 118.</P>
<P N="12">12. What stone did the <HI>Spaniards</HI> leave unmoved, in the Election of <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th. to wit, that by the exclusion of him, a more Hispaniolized Pope might be cho∣sen, and chiefly <HI>Sanctorio;</HI> though yet for all that, <HI>Clement</HI> were elected, who after he had absolved <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, King of <HI>France</HI> from his Excommunication, the Spaniards said openly, <HI>That the</HI> Pope <HI>was worse, and more an Heretick, then he whom he had absolved. Perionius</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Thuan.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. When <HI>Leo</HI> was chosen Pope, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> reclaimed much against it, especially Cardinal <HI>de Avila,</HI> who, when Pope <HI>Leo</HI> was nominated, cryed out as loud as he could, <HI>Treason, Treason! I protest, I protest! He is an enemy to the Catholick King!</HI> See <HI>Perionius</HI> in his Epistle to the King. And <HI>Hulsius in Leon.</HI> ii.
<PB N="16" REF="13"/> They had a design to poyson the Pope, nor was it far short of truth, for he lived but 25. days, and the Spanish Arts are known.</P>
<P N="14">14. In like manner did the <HI>Spaniards</HI> behave themselves, at the Election of <HI>Ʋr∣ban</HI> the 8th. which when they were not able to hinder, they set forth a Libel at <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein they asked, <HI>Whether the Pope were a Catholick, or no?</HI> To which <HI>Pasquil</HI> answered, <HI>Peace, peace, He is most Christian;</HI> And at the Popes Arms, they jeered thus,
<Q><L>Mella dabunt Gallis, Hispanis spicula, verum</L>
<L>Spicula si figunt, vita cum melle care∣bunt.</L>
<L>Their Honey <HI>France;</HI> to <HI>Spain</HI> their stings they'l give:</L>
<L>If stings they fix, nor Bees, nor Honey'l live.</L></Q></P>
<P>But another answered,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The Praevarications, and excesses of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> towards the rest of the Ca∣tholicks.</HEAD>
<P>THE rule whereby I have purposed to my self, briefly, and as it were, by <HI>Indexes,</HI> to shew the Praevarications of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> permits me not to recount whole Histories, of their excesses, and Praevarications towards the rest of the Catholicks themselvs for the confirmation of the Argument of this Chapter: it will suffice, slightly, and cursorily to hint such Histories, and Authors, as have written them more at large.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the year 1580. when the war was hot in <HI>Portugal,</HI> besides other extra∣ordinary cruelties committed by the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> against the Catholicks and Clergy, they came to the Church of St. <HI>Roch,</HI> neer the <HI>Almeda</HI> (which is the Jesuits Colledge, and whither many people, out of respect to the Jesuits, and for safety sake, had transported their goods of most
<PB N="18" REF="14"/> value) and thrusting out the <HI>Italians,</HI> un∣der colour of Friendship, and as if they had been sent by their Commanders to guard the Place, partly by force, and partly by theft, they plundered the said goods, and carried them to the Navy, then neer at hand. <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 70. And many of the Clergy, who would not adhere to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their Invasion of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> were killed, and destroyed by them, as is delivered by the Historians who wrote that War.</P>
<P N="3">3. When <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. sent his <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Souldiers against the <HI>Turk,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Antonio de Leva,</HI> the said Souldiers used all kinds of baseness, cove∣teousness, and libidiousness, towards the Catholicks in <HI>Austria,</HI> plundring, and firing of Towns, as if they had been amongst their open enemies.</P>
<P N="4">4. Who can choose but be strucken with extream horror, to read the sacking of the City of <HI>Antwerp</HI> 1576. as it is described by <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 62. when it began to be a vulgar saying amongst the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> to them of the same Religion, (when they begged them to spare them for Re∣ligions sake) <HI>If you have a good faith, that is for your souls; but if you have much
<PB N="19" REF="14"/> money, that is for us, and our Trunks.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The fine Latine Speech, and the form of condemning men, which <HI>Vargas</HI> the Spanish Inquisitor was wont to use, when, being drunk and drowzy, he pro∣nounced the same Sentence upon all such as were accused, unseen, and unheard; viz. <HI>Haeretici franxerunt templa &amp; simu∣lachra, Catholici nihil fecerunt contra, ergo utrique debent patibulari: The Hereticks have broken the Churches, and Images; the Catholicks have done nothing to the contra∣ry; therefore they must both be hanged.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Nor is that usual scoff of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> related by <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 42. to be silenced, <HI>viz. That one Salmons head was more worth then fifty Frogs heads:</HI> for the said Duke fulfilled this verse, <HI>Tros Tyriusque fuat, nullo discrimine habendi: Be they Protestants, or Catholicks, if they be not Hispaniolized,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>away with them.</HI> Hereof the Counts of <HI>Egmond, Horn, Montigni,</HI> and other Noblemen had sad experience; yea, and all the Catholick part of the Low-Countries likewise. Witness so many Towns taken, sackt, and dispeopled. Witness those Towns, which even yet, being loaded with <HI>Spanish</HI> Gar∣risons, are brought almost to the utmost
<PB N="20" REF="15"/> calamity, by various exactions, pressures, and burthens. Witness the Clergy of <HI>Portugal</HI> heretofore; and at present, the Kingdom of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> omitting that of <HI>Arragon, Sicilie</HI> and <HI>Naples.</HI> Witness some Bishops of the Empire, one where∣of, to another great man, brake out into these words: <HI>I see, and foresee, that the</HI> Spaniards <HI>seek nothing more, then that we, and other Bishops, may speedily die, and be∣queath our Bishopricks, and habits to them by Will. But what do we read? Yea, even whilest we are yet living, they are plotting and struggling, to pull them from us, and put them upon themselves.</HI> And further, says he, <HI>It is not enough for them, to have invaded the Electoral Land, but they will needs mount up to our Altars, and place themselves neer the Virgin and her childe. We need not</HI> (says he) <HI>go far; for the Arch∣bishop of</HI> Trevirs, <HI>and the Abbot of</HI> Maxi∣minus <HI>can testifie by experience,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Philip</HI> the second, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in his Pardon which he granted them who had resisted him in <HI>Portugal,</HI> ever ex∣cepted <HI>sacred Persons,</HI> so that he gave leave to all people, either to kill, or se∣verely punish them. For when that War of <HI>Portugal</HI> was ended, it is known, that
<PB N="21" REF="15"/> two thousand Religious men, in the Islands and in <HI>Portugal,</HI> either by the sword, or some other mischief, lost their lives for the said Wars sake. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 75. <HI>anno</HI> 1582.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> the second, son to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, confiscated all the goods of the Archbishop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> and caused him to be poysoned, because he had said (and that constantly indeed) that the said <HI>Charles</HI> last Confession was, that <HI>he confided only in the merit of Christ.</HI> See <HI>Baudartius, lib.</HI> 16. <HI>Apoph.</HI> where also is rehearsed that contemptible Epitaph made upon <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth.</P>
<Q><L>Hic jacet intùs,</L>
<L>Carolus quintus.</L>
<L>Ora pro eo bis vel ter,</L>
<L>Ave Maria &amp; Paternoster.</L></Q>
<P N="15">15. Anno 1576. in that fury, and di∣reption of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> raised by the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> wherein they spared none of what Religion soever, they ran up and down the Markets, and streets, crying out as loud as they could, <HI>Todo, todo, todo; All, all, all; Dineros y no palabras; Moneys and not words.</HI> They brake open gates
<PB N="22" REF="16"/> and windows with their guns, and wea∣pons, crying, <HI>Fuora, fuora, vellacos,</HI> Out Knaves, out; and one of the chief of them, caused these words to be wrought upon his pillow, <HI>Castigador de los Fla∣mengos; The Chastiser of the Flemings.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. At <HI>Mechlin,</HI> they plundred all the Archbishops of that Town, and all the Bishops of <HI>Namurs,</HI> his Church-stuff; the dammage whereof was valued at some millions of gold. See <HI>Speculum Hisp. Tyran. in Belgio,</HI> p. 41.</P>
<P N="17">17. At <HI>Owdenard,</HI> they threw some of the Clergy into the water. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> likewise sufficiently testifyed their cruelty towards the Catho∣licks, when the Admiral of <HI>Arragon</HI> in∣vaded <HI>Westphalia,</HI> the Bishoprick of <HI>Munster</HI> and <HI>Paterborn,</HI> nor spared so much as the Bishoprick of <HI>Colein.</HI> See <HI>Speculum Arragonicum, &amp; Specul. Hisp. tyran. in Belgio,</HI> p. 99, 100, 101, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="19">19. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> did more hurt in the <HI>Indies</HI> by their cruelty, then good by their Religion; yea, they were often cause, that the Religious men were mur∣thered and ill used by the <HI>Indians,</HI> as <HI>Bartholomè de la Casa</HI> teaches in his <HI>spec. Hisp. tyran. in India.</HI> And the same more∣over
<PB N="23" REF="16"/> says, that the Spaniards could not endure, that the said Religious men should be there, and teach, in regard that thereby the <HI>Indians</HI> were not so much their slaves, as being better informed; yea, and they took it ill, that any of them should be converted to the Christian Faith. The same <HI>Barthol.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. The Noblemen of <HI>Catalonia</HI> dis∣cover remarkable examples of the Spanish Praevarications against the Catholicks, and Clergy, in their <HI>Catholick Complaint,</HI> espe∣cially <HI>p.</HI> 4.10, 12. See below, <HI>Cap. de Cata∣loniae regno relata nostra.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. <HI>Nojo Moncata,</HI> who first prophaned the Church in the <HI>Vatican</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> (never violated before, and dedicated from the times of the very <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> to St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> the Saints Guardian of the City,) was a <HI>Spaniard. Jovius in ejus Elogio.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. The Spaniards use Churches for their safe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as Sanctuaries; and yet if others flie thither for refuge, they vio∣lently pull them out and carry them away, without any respect to the Sacred∣ness of the place, or priviledge; whereof the Reader hath an example in <HI>Perez,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon.</HI> And
<PB N="24" REF="17"/> <HI>Anno</HI> 1640. the Vice-King of <HI>Naples</HI> drew a certain Grandee of <HI>Naples</HI> out of the Church, and put him to death.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> The Spanish Inquisition.</HEAD>
<P>THat all mischiefs were brought into the world by this <HI>Pandora,</HI> the more sincere, and more prudent Catholicks themselves cannot deny, how much soever the Fathers of the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> defend it, and how much soever the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> like some Divine <HI>Palladium</HI> (as without which their Religion can hardly stand) adore it. Whereof <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 104. says thus.</P>

<PB N="25" REF="17"/> unheard of torments, thought nothing sharp and bitter enough to torture mens bodies, without sparing either sex or age. <HI>Robertus Abbatius.</HI> The Ci∣tizens of <HI>Lisbone</HI> offered King <HI>Philip</HI> five and twenty hundred M, as the Author of the Book of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> sayes: not that the said Inquisition might be taken away; but that, in the terrible jurisdiction thereof, this tempe∣rament might be kept, That no body might be imprisoned, without first knowing his accusers name, and expres∣sing the heads of his Crime; that so the accused, by the knowledge thereof, might be able to prepare his answer before his condemnation: And in short, that the prisoners might be heard, ac∣cording to custome in other Trials, be∣fore sentence were pronounced against him. But the Inquisitors would not endure to have their terrible power so circumscribed; for it rambles up and down to express its jurisdiction at pleasure, and hath this priviledge in it, to give credit to the testimonies of base and perfidious fellows, of whom no account is had in other causes. By this trick was weakned the liberty of
<PB N="26" REF="18"/> <HI>Lumbardy,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> the <HI>Arragoneses</HI> priviledges broken; the <HI>Lisbonezes</HI> and <HI>Portuguezes</HI> by degrees disarmed. <HI>Author anonymus ad ordines Belgicos An,</HI> 1605. <HI>apud Thuan. lib.</HI> 133.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was the Duke of <HI>Alva's</HI> designe having reduced the Low Countries to a hard servitude, and destroyed the Noblemen, to build a Castle for the <HI>Spanish Inquisition,</HI> or <HI>Tyranny,</HI> from whence he might send Armies, to de∣stroy the <HI>Germans, English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> under colour of establishing Reli∣gion; but the truth is, to impose their Monarchy upon the whole Christian World, which the Spaniards have long had in their thoughts; and for the atchievement whereof, there is nothing so detestable in counsell, nothing so horrible in fact, nor nothing so disho∣nest in issue, but they hold it lawful for them; witness <HI>Mounts</HI> and <HI>Berghs,</HI> seat upon the publick trust, with leave of <HI>Margaret,</HI> Dutches of <HI>Parma,</HI> in∣to <HI>Spain,</HI> and unworthily put to death, so many Noblemen beheaded, and more then 20000 innocent persons butchered by the Hangman. <HI>The States in their answer to the King of Denmark,</HI> 1597. <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 11.9.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="27" REF="18"/>3. The perverse and preposterous form of the Tryals of the Inquisition, against all naturall equity, and lawfull order, is observed in the explication of that jurisdiction, as also the barbarous∣nesse of the torments, wherewith (con∣trary to truth) whatsoever the Depu∣ties should think fit to fancie, they ex∣torted confession from the wretched and innocent prisoners; whereby it hapned, that they said, that it was not invented so much for the maintaining of piety, (for which there was another way shewed by the ancient Discipline of the Church) as for that, by ruining the fortunes of all, freemen might by this means be brought into danger. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 3. where he likewise re∣counts how the <HI>Dominican Inquisitors</HI> being ejected by the <HI>Neapolitans,</HI> there arose tumults about it. <HI>Anno</HI> 1542.</P>
<P N="4">4. How much the Dominican In∣quisitors were also hated by the people at <HI>Rome,</HI> and how odious the Inquisi∣tion grew to the <HI>Romans</HI> after the death of Pope <HI>Paul</HI> 4 <HI>Thuanus</HI> teaches, <HI>lib.</HI> 23. <HI>Anno</HI> 1559.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Charles</HI> 5. <HI>An.</HI> 1550. granted the Inquisitors power to question not only
<PB N="28" REF="19"/> the common people, but the Magistrates also, and make them swear to answer to their Interrogatories, and discover their knowledge; besides, that part of the goods of the accused, was propo∣sed to the Informers for a reward: and so a large gate was opened to calumnies and vexations both against all the sub∣jects of the Low-Countreys, and all such strangers also, as for any respect of business betook themselves thither, whereof the number was very great. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 6. where it is also related, how the people of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> by the intercession of the Emperours sister <HI>Mary,</HI> got this Decree to be mitigated, and the hatefull name of <HI>Inquisition</HI> to be abolished.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="19"/> the second was questioned by the In∣quisition for saying, That the <HI>Flemings were to be more mildly handled,</HI> which saying is reported to have hastened his death; yea, it is held for certain, that the Inquisitors disputed, <HI>Whether the bones of</HI> Charles 5, <HI>were not to be digged up and burned, because he seem'd before his death, to be inclined to the opinion, that man is onely saved by Faith through Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> The Praevarications of the Spaniards against the Empire.</HEAD>
<P>THe Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> 5. though by nature a most mild Prince, and most constant in his word, was like not∣withstanding, by the continual whispe∣rings of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom he had about him, to be carried away to the
<PB N="31" REF="20"/> contrary, as it appears in the cause of <HI>Luther,</HI> in the cause of <HI>Frederick</HI> Ele∣ctor of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and of <HI>Philip</HI> Landgrave of <HI>Hessia.</HI> For what endeavour did they not use to make him deprive <HI>Lu∣ther</HI> of his Pass, and the publick faith, and abandon him to their disposall. But he generously bid them be gone, saying, <HI>Though there were no faith in the world, yet shall it be found in me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The kindlers of that war which he waged against the Protestants, were certainly no other but his Spanish Counsellors.</P>
<P N="3">3. And that the <HI>Landgrave</HI> was not faithfully dealt with, was not so much to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e imputed to the Emperour, as to the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and the Archbishop of <HI>Arra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who interpreted the word of <HI>Captivity</HI> not to be so understood, <HI>as if he were not to be detained at all, but that he was not to be perpetually detained.</HI> And it is also to be ascribed to the bloody counsels of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that <HI>John Frederick</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> fell into ha∣zard of his life, by a sentence already pronounced against him by the Empe∣rour, N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r was it any bodies work but theirs (for they could do all things with
<PB N="32" REF="21"/> <HI>Caesar</HI>) that the Religion and form of Government was changed, in many free Cities of the Empire; and that those captive Princes, for five years together, to the huge dishonour of the <HI>German</HI> Nation, were carried up and down by the Emperour as it were in triumph. These and the like enormities exercised by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> through the whole Empire in <HI>Charles</HI> his time, the Reader may find in <HI>Sleidens Commentaries.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>An.</HI> 1597. <HI>Francisco de Mendoza</HI> very earnestly urged the Emperour in K. <HI>Philips</HI> name, that the Vice-County of <HI>Vezonson,</HI> (which being hereditary in the Family of the <HI>Cabillers,</HI> was trans∣ferred by lawfull succession upon the <HI>Nassaws</HI>) being now devolv'd upon the Empire by the prescription of <HI>Willi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> might be tranfer∣red upon the said <HI>Philip,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Deputy.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The Emperour being desired to constitute a Governour and a Senate in the Territory of <HI>Cleve,</HI> and <HI>Gulick:</HI> he answered, that he must consult thereof with the Princes of the Empire; &amp; for the rest that he would take care that a man very well affected to the <HI>Reformed
<PB N="33" REF="21"/> Religion,</HI> should be sent into those Dut∣chies; but that King <HI>Philip</HI> must have a strict eye over all by his officers, though still with this caution, not to raise suspi∣tion in the breasts of them to whom that succession belonged. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 9. <HI>c.</HI> 118,</P>
<P N="8">8. The same <HI>Mendoza</HI> treated with the inhabitants of <HI>Newburgh, Franck∣furt,</HI> and others, about appointing a Church for the Catholicks. <HI>Ibid. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had long since (in hope) devoured the Dutchy of <HI>Cleve;</HI> which afterwards by their Hispaniolized Councellors, after the decease of the Prince, they in part obtained. <HI>Acta Principum.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. The same <HI>Francisco de Mendoza, anno</HI> 1598. invaded the said Dutchy of <HI>Cleve</HI> and <HI>Gulick,</HI> with 20000 men of various nations, took <HI>Orso,</HI> and other Towns, and made incursions into <HI>West∣phalia,</HI> and the neighbouring places, and seized upon <HI>Alpen,</HI> though it were declared <HI>Neutral.</HI> In the same manner served he the Countess of <HI>Moersen,</HI> who, though she made her complaint to the Archduke <HI>Albert,</HI> got nothing but words for her labour. He likewise at∣tempted
<PB N="34" REF="22"/> the Citie of <HI>Cleve,</HI> which is the Princes seat, and he perfidiously kild and burnt <HI>Wirich,</HI> Count of <HI>Bruchen,</HI> after he had surrendred himself and his Castle to him upon Quarter. He also took other Towns <HI>Buderick, Dinslack, Holt, Rese,</HI> and <HI>Wesal,</HI> he sufficiently opprest and afflicted; the Counties of <HI>Swartzenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Benthemien</HI> he de∣vasted, nor spared he the County of <HI>Altenburgh,</HI> or the Bishoprick of <HI>Pa∣terburn,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="12">12. With no better seasons did they
<PB N="35" REF="22"/> invade the lower <HI>Palatinat,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Simmeren,</HI> and the Bishoprick of <HI>Tre∣virs,</HI> there they committed the former excesses and prevarications in the Em∣pire; and indeed it is but like them, to keep <HI>Frankental</HI> against the express Ar∣ticles, and their promise made to King <HI>James</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to restore it to his daughter the King of <HI>Bohemiah's</HI> Wi∣dow: But they think it a piece of po∣licie to cheat Kings with oathes, as men do children with nut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P N="14">14. At the same time, by the insti∣gation of King <HI>Philips</HI> Embassadour, and <HI>Mendoza,</HI> a sentence was pro∣nounced against the Citizens of <HI>Aquen∣sis. Ibid.</HI></P>

<P N="16">16. <HI>Ancellus</HI> the French Embassadour in his speech to the Princes of <HI>Germany, Anno</HI> 1597. sayes; <HI>In Italy there are few Countries which turn from the Empire un∣der pretext of protection, do not groan un∣der the cruel yoak of the</HI> Spaniards: <HI>Nor is</HI> Germany <HI>to hope better, in which the Town of</HI> Berk <HI>upon the</HI> Rheine, <HI>is already, against all right and equity, held by a forraign Garrison; and the Castle of</HI> Starkenburgh <HI>in</HI> Westphalia <HI>is daily fortified with all expe∣dition.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> The Praevarications of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> against the Kings and Kingdoms of France.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>France</HI> is neerest to the Empire in limits, so is it also neerest to the plots and tricks which are framed a∣gainst it by the Spanish Nation. For, in regard that no kingdom is a greater <HI>Re∣mora</HI> to the Spanish Monarchy then <HI>France:</HI> therfore do the Spaniards bend all their forces and studies, to the con∣quest thereof; insomuch as I could dis∣cover the whole Magazine of their plots, designs, and prevarications a∣gainst it, were I not hindred by other reasons: but amongst many it may suf∣fice for the present to bring some few. I will silence the warres between <HI>Charles</HI> &amp; <HI>Francis,</HI> because they were publick, as also other Martiall differences, and will onely touch upon some clancular at∣tempts, and such as were exercised se∣cretly, and under colour, if not of true friendship, yet certainly with no shew of open hostility.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="41" REF="25"/>1. In the first place, we meet with the League of the <HI>Henotickes,</HI> who affected to be called <HI>Zelots;</HI> in which action, not onely and singly of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but a manifold prevarication might be obser∣ved, of which conspiracy, or <HI>Holy League,</HI> (as they would needs have it styled) the Noble <HI>Historian Thuan</HI> sayes thus, <HI>lib.</HI> 90. Never was there Portent in <HI>France,</HI> to be compared with that pernitious faction, who fancied to be called <HI>Zelots:</HI> for having seduced the hearts of the com∣mon people, the Towns and Cities throughout the whole kingdom revolted from their lawfull King and Magistrate, and letting the <HI>Spaniards</HI> into the king∣dome, laid all <HI>France</HI> open to forraigne &amp; pernitious enemies to the <HI>French</HI> name; insomuch as that a certain learned man, not unpleasantly said, <HI>That though the Prodigie which appeared in</HI> Nero's <HI>time, (when, in the Agro Marruccino, the whole Olivet of</HI> Vectius Mercellus was <HI>carried over the high way, and plowed lands instantly brought in its stead) were very great, yet the French were a greater miracle to us in our dayes, namely to see</HI> Spain <HI>come into</HI> France, <HI>and</HI> Frenchmen <HI>to behold</HI> Spaniards <HI>strut∣ting in the middle of Paris.</HI> Thua.

<P>VVE have staid long enough in a continent, let us now passe the Sea, and see whether the King of <HI>Spain</HI> have shewn himself more faithfull to the <HI>English</HI> then to the <HI>French,</HI> and others. Not a whit. Read what follows, and you will find with me, that <HI>a Wolf is every where a Wolf,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Attempts against</HI> Q Eliza∣beth.</NOTE> and would as well take and devour the markt as un∣markt sheep. And to begin with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it cannot be denied, but that the Spaniard used all possible means to deprive her both of her kingdom and of her life. <HI>Thuan</HI> testifies, <HI>lib.</HI> 44. <HI>Anno</HI> 1569. that <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> by the instigation of the Spaniards, and others, endeavoured to innovate things in <HI>England;</HI> and to that end <HI>Rudolphus Robertus</HI> came into <HI>England,</HI> to solicite the <HI>English</HI> to disloyalty, and promise them great matters from the Pope, and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and he was
<PB N="49" REF="29"/> employed by the Queen, as her chief Minister and Assistant.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Spanish Ministers by their Emissaries the Jesuits, induced the Duke of <HI>Norfolk, Anno</HI> 1572. to undertake dangerous designes against Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> was not doubted of by the wiser sort of those times; yea, and he was brought to lose his head for it. <HI>Hist. Belg.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In the year 1601. the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by the instigation of <HI>Garnet Robert,</HI> a Jesuit, endeavoured to trouble affairs in <HI>England;</HI> but that enterprize being detected, vanisht into smoak. <HI>Mettera∣nus lib.</HI> 27.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the King of <HI>Spain</HI> did direct all his enterprises, that by the Jesuits he might molest the affairs, and innovate Religion in <HI>England,</HI> so many reiterated designes, but most of them being fru∣strated, the writing made against the Je∣suits in <HI>England</HI> 1602. in which among other titles they have this name <HI>that they are the King of Spains Trumpeters.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot forbear to speak of that stu∣pendious Fleet which was sent against <HI>England</HI> and the Queen, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1588.</P>
<P N="5">5. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> trecherously
<PB N="50" REF="30"/> thinking to destroy Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and to possesse himself of the English Nation, provided a mighty Navy, con∣sisting of one hundred and thirty ships, where of Galeasses and Galleons seven∣ty two goodly ships like to floating Towers, in which were Souldiers 19290. Mariners 8350. Gally slaves 2080. great Ordnance 2630. On the twentieth of May they weighed Anchor from the River <HI>Trigas,</HI> but were by tempest so miserably disperst, that it was long ere they met again: But they sent before to the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> that he with his Forces consisting of fifty thousand old Souldiers, should be ready to joyn with them, and with his shipping to conduct them into <HI>England,</HI> and to land his Army at the <HI>Thames</HI> mouth. But God so ordered, that partly by distresse of weather, and partly by the valour of the English, they were driven back with infinite loss and disgrace.</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>Fontano, a</HI> Spaniard, with a vast sum of money (to wit, 50000 Pistols) corrupted Doctor <HI>Lopez,</HI> to poyson Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as the said <HI>Lopez</HI> him∣self; together with <HI>Emanuel Ludovicus Tinotius,</HI> &amp; <HI>Stephanus Errera,</HI> freely con∣fest. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 109.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="51" REF="30"/>7. <HI>Ibarra</HI> attempted the same plot upon the said Queen, by <HI>Edmond</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> Cousin german to him who per∣fidiously betrayed the Fort of <HI>Zutphan</HI> to the enemy: as also by <HI>Richard Willi∣ams,</HI> besides another youth, and other complices, for which he promised them 40000 Pistols.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Anno</HI> 1601. the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were brought into <HI>Ireland</HI> by <HI>Hugh</HI> Earle of <HI>Tiron,</HI> but were but scurvily entertained there. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 125.</P>
<P N="9">9. When, in the year 1603. certain Eng∣glish were taken and executed for a con∣spiracy against the King, <HI>Carolus Ligneus,</HI> Count of <HI>Aremberg,</HI> who was then Em∣bassador there from the Archduke <HI>Al∣bert,</HI> was suspected to have conspired with them, <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 129.</P>
<P N="10">10. The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> not long after the death of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> orde∣red the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> then Governor of the Low Countries, to promise in his name, the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both men and mony, against the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> thereby the more easily to revenge his mothers death. And to that end the said Duke sent <HI>Robert Bruss,</HI> a Scotch Gen∣tleman, into <HI>Scotland,</HI> with a great deal
<PB N="52" REF="31"/> of money. Besides, that the Scotch King was put in hope to marry the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> provided that he embrac'd the Roman Religion, which was proposed by one <HI>William Crich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> who then be∣longed to the Popes <HI>Nuntio,</HI> and had formerly been Rector sometime of the Jesuits Colledge at <HI>Lyons,</HI> and he en∣deavoured to perswade <HI>Bruss,</HI> either by force or fraud to kill <HI>John Metelan,</HI> High Chancelor of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and because <HI>Bruss</HI> abhorred so wicked a fact, <HI>Crich∣ton</HI> accused him to <HI>Fontano,</HI> who clapt him up in prison for fourteen moneths together. See <HI>Hospinian.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. How cunningly some of the Spanish Emissaries endeavoured to perswade <HI>James</HI> (then King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and after∣wards of <HI>England</HI> too) that it was ne∣cessary for him to have a league and friendship with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> saying that it would much advantage him to have the favour of the <HI>Spaniards. Thuan. lib.</HI> 83.</P>
<P N="12">12. The dangerous designes of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by the Jesuits and their Emissa∣ries, to destroy both the Queen and Kingdom of <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1596. is described by <HI>Thuan</HI> and others in the
<PB N="53" REF="31"/> English Complaint to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P N="13">13. Divers outrages and Acts of ho∣stility have been committed by the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> against the subjects of <HI>England</HI> in their Colonies of the West Indies.</P>
<P N="14">14 <HI>Anno</HI> 1605. Certain <HI>English</HI> men being on the North side of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> were enticed a shore by a Priest named Father <HI>John,</HI> on promise of secure tra∣ding, were inhumanly and barbarously murthered by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The Master was tied naked to a tree, and most cru∣elly pinched and stung to death.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>An.</HI> 1608. The <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Plimouth</HI> trading to <HI>Virginia,</HI> was assaulted by the King of <HI>Spains</HI> ships, and notwithstand∣ding the Master produced the Broad Seal of <HI>England,</HI> he with all the men were condemned to the Gallies, where some were with much cruelty, beaten to death.</P>
<P N="16">16. With what tricks and juggles the Match in <HI>Spain,</HI> between the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> and the King of <HI>Spains</HI> daugh∣ter, was treated, prolonged, and at last quite eluded, is sufficiently known to such as were employed in that business. So that <HI>Spaniards</HI> are every where <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> The Praevarications of the Spaniards against the King and Kingdom of Portugall.</HEAD>
<P>WHen <HI>Sebastian</HI> King of <HI>Portugall, Anno</HI> 1578. resolved to undertake that Expedition into <HI>Africa,</HI> (fatall both to him and his Kingdom) <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> seemed, forsooth, at first, to disapprove, and disswade it; but it was observed by the wiser sort, that he was not reall in the business, as promising much, and performing little; yea, and somtimes instantly denying his promises, <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 65.</P>
<P N="2">2. King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> by his Emissa∣ries the Jesuits, deterred <HI>Henry</HI> successor to <HI>Sebastian</HI> aforesaid, as well by mena∣ces as other perswasions, from his purpose of subrogating <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Braganzia</HI> in his place, in respect of his age, howbeit all the Nobility of <HI>Portugall</HI> favoured the said Duke; yea, and he also wrote Letters to the common people of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to debauch them, and gain them to him∣self, which he at length, in his Npehew,
<PB N="55" REF="32"/> <HI>Anno</HI> 1640 atchieved. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 65. <HI>sub finem.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. None have ever more sharply re∣sisted free election for want of Male∣issue, and in a dubious right of successi∣on to the Crown of <HI>Portugall,</HI> then King <HI>Philip</HI> and his adherents, <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 69.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Philip,</HI> by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Castile,</HI> deterred <HI>Henry,</HI> King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> from marriage, that by his dying a Batchelour, he might more easily come to the Crown of <HI>Portugal. Thuan, lib.</HI> 69.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Thuanus</HI> saith, that <HI>Philip</HI> intended to prosecute his right to the Kingdom of <HI>Portugall</HI> by way of Arms, as putting more confidence in his might then in his right, or in the opinions of his Law∣yers.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Philip</HI> made many large promises to King <HI>Henry,</HI> and the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Ossuma</HI> his Embassadour, to make him King; which afterwards were not half performed. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 69.</P>
<P N="7">7. Whilst the suit was still depending, and King <HI>Henry</HI> yet living, King <HI>Philip</HI> armed himself against <HI>Portugal;</HI> which <HI>Henry</HI> perceiving, began to boggle, as being perswaded by <HI>Leo Euric,</HI> a Jesuit, <HI>that he would merit heaven, if he would
<PB N="56" REF="33"/> appoint Philip for his Successour. Thuan. lib.</HI> 69.</P>
<P N="8">8. The matter being come to blowes, <HI>Philip</HI> referred the businesse to the Di∣vines, (the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and the <HI>Franciscans</HI>) to be discust at leasure: A fine way of proceeding, and proving his cause! For they, excluding the Popes authority, be∣cause it was a meer earthly business, &amp;c. gave their votes for <HI>Philip. Thuan. lib.</HI> 69. And howbeit the Pope indeed first by <HI>Sega</HI> his <HI>Nuntio,</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Alexander Riario,</HI> were urgent with <HI>Philip</HI> to desist from war, til the business were composed, yet could he effect no∣thing at all with him. See <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 70. <HI>Anno</HI> 1580. but put off the Conference with various reasons, delayes, and ex∣cuses.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> took <HI>Cascaio</HI> by force; and although before it were done, the besieged put forth a white <HI>Co∣lour,</HI> and desired a Parley, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> notwithstanding in hope of prey, stormed the Town▪ and put <HI>Diego de Meneses,</HI> whom they found there, together with <HI>Enric Perei ra</HI> Governour of the Castle, with some others, to death, <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 70.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="57" REF="33"/>11. <HI>An.</HI> 1581. King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> at his coronation, gave the Nobility of <HI>Portugal</HI> a general pardon for what was past; but the event answered not their expectation: for not onely <HI>Antonio Prior, Francisco Portugallo,</HI> Count of <HI>Vimioso,</HI> and Bishop <HI>Juan Garda,</HI> bro∣ther to the said Count, together with fifty more principal men of the contrary faction, and all religious men, were ex∣cluded from it. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 73.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Philip</HI> readily granted the <HI>Portu∣guezes</HI> all such of their requests as were of almost no moment; but such as were of any concernment, he either flatly denied, or answering them ambiguously in the margine eluded. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 73. In the same manner he also denied the requests of the Nobility.</P>
<P N="13">13. How <HI>Philip</HI> gul'd the demands of such of the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> as had ren∣dred him faithfull service in the acquest of the Crown, <HI>Thuan</HI> teaches, <HI>lib.</HI> 75. saying, <HI>That either the Kingdom of Por∣tugal, in right, belonged to him, and then they were bound in justice to help him get it, or not; and so they were traytors to their own Countrey: but whetherso∣ever it were of both, he owed them nothing,
<PB N="58" REF="34"/> and that it ought to suffice them that he had given them their lives.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. How inexorable and severe <HI>Philip</HI> shewed himself to some sacred persons, who were against him in his acquisition of <HI>Portugal,</HI> see by the Letters above, Chap. 2. for two thou∣sand of them perisht in that war. <HI>Thu∣an. lib.</HI> 72.</P>
<P N="15">15. Immediatly after <HI>Philip</HI> got the Kingdome of <HI>Portugall,</HI> he utterly outed the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> and preferred <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the government thereof; Whereupon <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 78. <HI>Anno</HI> 1583. It troubled the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> that <HI>Fran∣cisco Villefanga,</HI> a <HI>Castilian,</HI> and not a <HI>Portuguez,</HI> was made high Treasurer of <HI>Portugall.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Michael de Vasconcellis,</HI> the Spanish Kings Secretary, shewed himself so proud and insolent in the said Kings Councell at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that he forbore not to strike some prime persons, who came to him upon bu∣sinesse.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> The Praevarications of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against the Low Countreys.</HEAD>
<P>TIme, &amp; the greedy Readers expecta∣tion require me now to return out of forraign parts, into our <HI>Low Coun∣treys,</HI> and shew what things have been cruelly, perfidiously, trecherously, and lecherously, both done &amp; suffered then by the Spaniards, before and, after this war, which hath already been begun, (and with no lesse variety, then heat, and courage of the parties contending) continued since the year 1566. But in regard there is so great a cloud and bulk of them, that one my sooner grasp the sky in ones hand, then relate them either with tongue or pen: Besides, that there be many other Authors extant, of both
<PB N="60" REF="35"/> Religions, who have collected them with as much faith as care, and have in∣serted them in their Histories accord∣ing to the series of years; I will for∣bear to tire my pen with setting them down. There are few who have not seen the History of <HI>Emanuel Metterano,</HI> together with the continuation of <HI>Wil∣liam Baudert,</HI> written in <HI>Low-Dutch;</HI> as also the Relations of <HI>P. Boorn,</HI> of the same War: besides the History of <HI>Eber∣hard Raid;</HI> to be silent of the noble Hi∣storian <HI>Jacobo Augusto Thuano,</HI> the <HI>Li∣vies</HI> of the French Kingdom, by whom both the beginning and successe of the Low-Countrey-war, are written with great elegancy, and integrity; where we may also see what plots were contrived against the Noblemen, and especially a∣gainst them of the house of <HI>Orange,</HI> both Father &amp; Son, how many Towns taken, and miserably plundred, and the Inhabi∣tants more then barbarously treated: how many rebellions raysed by the Spa∣nish Souldiers; and how miserably the subjects and Citizens (especially they of <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Mecklin</HI>) were abused and pillaged: yea, how many thousands died by the Hangmans hands, excluding
<PB N="61" REF="35"/> such as perisht in the warres. To which may also be added the <HI>Martyrology</HI> of <HI>Corvinus,</HI> and the Apologie of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> besides the speech of <HI>Ansellus</HI> to the German Princes, toge∣ther with other Apologetick writings, set forth by the Noblemen of the Low Countreys; likewise <HI>Speculum Hispan. Tyran.</HI> In which book the Reader will find such things as will amaze him, principally <HI>pag.</HI> 35, 36, 37. at <HI>Brussels, Mounts</HI> in <HI>Hennault</HI> upon the <HI>Moze, Lile, Tornay, Roterdam, Mechlin, Zut∣phan, Nard, Harlem, Antwerp,</HI> (the sacking whereof exceeded all the rest, above 8000 Citizens, and Souldiers being massacred in it) besides that they extorted and took from the Inhabitants above forty Tuns of gold, excluding Jewels, and other things of price, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For these, and other causes, I shall not weary my own hands with writing, nor the Readers eyes with reading of these things; but will make a leap over rhe sea into <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>That excellent book of <HI>Thomas Cam∣ponella,</HI> a Spanish Fryer, must not be left out of this Catalogue, wherein be shews above thirty wayes, for the King of
<PB N="62" REF="36"/> <HI>Spain</HI> to subjugate the <HI>Low Countreys:</HI> as first, by sowing the seeds of discord amongst the Inhabitants, Secondly, by throwing them out of their Countrey; to which he adds this advantage, that the King should fly to <HI>Jasons</HI> Arts, and procure some <HI>Medaea,</HI> that is, some promiscuous marriages.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> The Praevarications and Excesses of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against the Kingdom or Principal of Catalonia.</HEAD>
<P>THe States and Noblemen, chiefly the Magistrates of <HI>Barcelona, Anno</HI> 1640. publisht a Book called, <HI>A Catho∣lick Complaint</HI> to King <HI>Philip;</HI> wherein first, they demonstrated their fidelity and constancy in his service, freenesse, zeal, submission, and other deserts to∣wards him, whereby they justly deserved and ought to be more gently, and better used by the Spaniards; for, as they write, chap. 7. whilst the war lasted between him and the King of <HI>France</HI> in the
<PB N="63" REF="36"/> County of <HI>Rossillion, Anno</HI> 1640. they maintained 30000 men for seven mo∣neths together. Gathered and presented him an infinite sum of money at several times, for his necessary uses, without order, insomuch that scarce any Pro∣vince hath deserved more &amp; better. But what thanks received they? Those, which in their Preface, or Epistle to the King, they complain of, to wit, that they had been bitterly treated by his Souldiers, who (as they write c. 4.) had extorted a great deal of money from the Husband∣men; that they had committed various sacrileges in Monasteries, Churches, and other sacred places, plundred Churches, and fired▪ them, broken Fonts, burnt consecrated Hosts, violated the Images of Christ and the Virgin. In the se∣venth chapter they shew how the fa∣vour which they had merited, was be∣stowed upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for that they bad been traduced by them to the King, to have run out of the field; and afterwards they accuse the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of envy and falshood, and purge them∣selves to the King, of the crimes objected against them, saying, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> make other mens merits and honour
<PB N="64" REF="37"/> their own, &amp; by all means extenuate, obli∣terate, and forget the praises of others. They recount the various Arts of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> adding, that since the year 1620, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had done nothing in <HI>Catalonia</HI> but vex, torture, and sup∣press the <HI>Catalonians</HI> in manifold man∣ners, infringed their ancient priviledges and immunities, and took them quite from them, traduced and accused them to the King, sowed differences and dis∣cords betweeen the King and the States of the kingdome, utterly averting his Majesties heart from them, imposed un∣necessary charges upon the King and kingdom, exhausted the Countrey with exactions and expeditions, and brought it even to beggery: Adding moreover, that now they were worse, and more cruelly used by their Associates, and Auxiliaries the Spaniards, then they for∣merly were by their profest and open enemies the <HI>Mores:</HI> that the Count of <HI>Fonteclaro,</HI> squeezed a great sum of mo∣ney out of the Company of Merchants, violated their wives and daughters, kild their husbands, and others, plundered their goods and estates, fired their vil∣lages, many whereof they express by
<PB N="65" REF="37"/> their names, That <HI>Leonardo Mala,</HI> the kings Captain, seized upon the Gates of <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> extorted money from the inhabitants for going in and out; and that adulteries, rapes, murthers, plunders, house-breakings, and firings, were but sport and pleasure to the Spa∣niards. That Baron <HI>Lisaga</HI> took away their goods, and sold them by out-cry, fired their houses, and committed an infinity of other tyrannicall facts and insolencies against the Catalonians. And although they complained of these ex∣cesses to the kings Officers, and Mini∣sters, they had effected nothing but to be sent back with scorn; which irritated the Souldiers to commit still greater outrages. They complain likewise, that the kings Officers were still desirous of warres, and to prolong them; yea, and to sow warres out of warres, thereby to gain time and opportunity to vex and burthen the people, and enrich themselves and theirs; as finding that it was better to be rich Souldiers in war, then poor and contemptible Fel∣lows in peace, <HI>chap.</HI> 8. They often com∣plain that one (and he no rich Coun∣treyman neither) was forced to quarter
<PB N="66" REF="38"/> and maintain above a dozen Souldiers, which was enough to devour them to the very bones: and when there was no more left to give them, that they pluckt them by the Beards, drag'd them about the floor, beat them and crippled them with their swords, abusing them more∣over with most bitter scoffs, saying, <HI>Go now, and sell thy wife and children, and give us meat and drink.</HI> They besieged the Castle of <HI>Antonio de Fulvia</HI> (a man of prime Nobility, and beloved by all for his integrity of life) burnt the gates, pillaged the Countrey peoples goods, brought thither to be secured, and most cruelly massacred the said <HI>Antonio,</HI> with some others, in the very Church, with a sacred Image in his hand, and left him naked on the ground.</P>
<P>Cap. 10. They relate how in a cer∣tain village called <HI>Gava,</HI> the Spaniards proceeded, by killing, ravishing of wives in the presence of their husbands, hanging men by the arms to extort their money from them, &amp; beating of a Priest in the Church, saying, <HI>Though it were the Apostle Paul himself, and had the Sacrament of the Altar in his hands, he should not be better used.</HI> And in another
<PB N="67" REF="38"/> place, they stole all the ornaments out of the Church, ravisht young women, and murthered their parents who came to help them; and all this without punishment; nay, they say, that the Spanish Officers and Ministers severely forbad the Lawyers to undertake the cause or defence of the Catalonians: Their petitions were derided, and the Inhabitants prohibited under pain of death, to complain of the injuries done them; so that the Spaniards do often more cruelly and hainously handle their Friends and Associate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then open Enemies.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia</HI> there is nothing seen or heard, but women bewailing the mur∣therings of their husbands, and husbands the ravishing of their wives, and abusing of their marriage beds: old men com∣plaining of the violating of their daugh∣ters, and the daughters lamenting the losse of their chastity: Orphans howling for the violent death of their parents, &amp; both Citizens and Countrey-men invo∣cating the help of Heaven in these calamities, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Chap. 12. They recount how the Citie of <HI>Perpinian</HI> was vext, besieged,
<PB N="68" REF="39"/> and fifty two Fire-balls thrown into it, and five hundred sixty four houses con∣sumed with fire, and 1115. pillaged; not so much as the very Churches spared, and the Monastery of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> to∣gether with other sacred places plunde∣red by the Spaniards, who took above eight thousand Ducats, in despight of the intercession of the Bishop, and the Religious. The Inhabitants of <HI>Perpinian</HI> disarmed; no body permitted to go out of the Town, and the Townsmen imprisoned. The complaints which were made hereof to the Spani∣ards, were either not accepted, or plainly rejected, or else put off till other times. Many of the prime Citizen were taken and cast in prison with∣out cause, and there retained for some moneths, before they could know why; no justice administred, the rents of the Bishop, and Clergy of <HI>Barcel∣lona</HI> taken away; all Jurisdiction, both Temporal and Spiritual transferred upon the Spaniards, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They also complain of the Spanish Kings ingratitude, concluding there∣by, that they were forced to take arms
<PB N="69" REF="39"/> against their wills, &amp;c. But I will stay here, and remit my Reader to their <HI>Ca∣tholick complaint,</HI> out of which I have taken this.</P>

<P>VVHat I have written elswhere, that the Spaniards endeavour to di∣minish the ancient liberties and immuni∣ties of other Kingdomes and Provinces, thereby to give the inhabitants an oc∣casion to rebell, and themselves a fair pretence to chastise them (as they call it) and to invade, depress and plunder o∣thers, and do all things according to their lust, is testified by the process, and suit of <HI>Antonio Perez,</HI> which I wil briefly relate here.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> the second, resolved for some suspitions, to destroy <HI>Escovedo,</HI> Secre∣tary to <HI>Don Juan de Austria</HI> his brother, and that by some clancular Art not to

After a long impri∣sonment, wherein <HI>Perez</HI> was sometimes proclaimed free, and then instantly clapt up again, and at length also rackt; the Letters, wherein the King had com∣manded him to do this act, were, the greatest part of them, extorted from his wife, by the fraud of her Confessor, or Ghostly Father, and she, together with her children, also taken, and all their goods sold by an out cry; so that poor <HI>Perez</HI> had nothing left him but his life, and even that in imminent dan∣ger too. But he made his escape to <HI>Sa∣ragosa</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="40"/> in <HI>Arragon;</HI> whither the Kings Officers pursuing him, took him out of Sanctuary, and threw him in Jayl, from whence he was freed, and taken again, and delivered to the Kings Governor. The <HI>Saragosians</HI> angry hereat, as a thing against their priviledges, making a con∣course of the people, forced him out of that Inquisition, and kild some of the Kings Officers in the tumult, and so <HI>Perez</HI> being freed, &amp; absolved by a pub∣lick sentence of Justice, evaded. After he had been three years in this misery, sometimes a prisoner, and sometimes a freeman, sometimes condemned, and sometimes absolved, the king by the instigation of the Spaniards, to revenge this injury done them by the <HI>Saragosi∣ans,</HI> sent an Army into <HI>Arragon,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Antonia Vergas,</HI> which that State by vigor of their priviledges, opposed. But the king wrote kind Let∣ters to such of them, as whom, after∣wards by the dissembling of <HI>Vergas,</HI> he chiefly punish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for as soon as <HI>Ver∣gas</HI> was admitted, he first laid hold of them, to whom the king had written so kindly, and afterwards of the rest of the principall Officers of the kingdom; re∣storing
<PB N="72" REF="41"/> them who had formerly been thrown out of their places by the Depu∣ties, as traytors to their Countrey, and subverters of the Lawes. He confisca∣ted the estates of most of them; he also seized upon the Lord chief Justice of <HI>Arragon.</HI> whose name was <HI>Juan de Nuz∣za,</HI> and twenty hours after admitting of no excuse, or defence, caused him to be beheaded, and his estate to be con∣fiscated. The Citizens were deprived of their priviledges; so that that murther of <HI>Escevedo</HI> proved highly damageable to <HI>Perez,</HI> destructive to the kingdome of <HI>Arragon,</HI> reproachfull to the King, dishonorable to the Spaniards, and scan∣dalous to the whole world. <HI>Ex relatione Historiae de Perezzio.</HI></P>
<P>The Catholick Kings Governor in <HI>Arragon,</HI> sent once for the Advocate <HI>Misero Sarces,</HI> who conceiving that the Governour wanted his advice, came speedily to him; and as soon as he came, the Governour caused him to be stran∣gled, without any lawfull proceeding at all. <HI>Ex eadem relatione.</HI></P>

<P>The Spaniards also most injuriously treated the Religious, because out of compassion they had undertaken to pro∣tect and mediate for <HI>Perez;</HI> as seizing upon them, and plundering them, and casting them in prison; insomuch as a certain Canon died of grief. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>

<P>IN the description of the kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> which is in <HI>Thesauro Politico apotelesmate</HI> 62. the Author sayes thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Spaniards have extenua∣ted this Body (i. e. <HI>Naples</HI>) monstrously, and yet they hold it with such suspition,
<PB N="74" REF="42"/> that not content to have duld the heart of it, and broken all its members, they labour still by all means, to hinder it from gathering strength, lest it should afterwards abhor physick, and with great losse of reputation, and disadvan∣tage, extrude the Physitian.</P>
<P N="2">2. King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> after the death of Queen <HI>Joan</HI> (howbeit she by her Will transferred the kingdome of <HI>Naples</HI> upon <HI>Rene,</HI> brother to the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>) took it, and made himself free Lord thereof, pretending that it was reverted to the Church, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Spaniards alwayes take a course to have the Popes favourable to them, in the cause of the kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> and to lessen and depress all such as maintain the report of any other power in the said kingdom.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Spaniards somtimes grant the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Noblemen some Offices, especially in the Court, but publick ad∣ministrations to none, or very seldome, and with great limitations.</P>
<P N="5">5. Whilst the King of <HI>Spain</HI> com∣mitted the government of all things in the kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> to the Spani∣ards, and suffered no complaints to be
<PB N="75" REF="42"/> made of his Ministers, the insolencie and licentiousness of the said Spaniards sweld so big, that abusing the kings design, they tyannically satiated their intollerable pride by the depression of others.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the Vice-kings Officers and Governors have ingrost all the riches of all the Provinces. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. By how much the severer an Offi∣cer professes himfelf in the kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> especially towards the Nobility, in so much the more favour and esteem is he with the Spaniards, by whom he is advanced in Court, and exalted to higher degrees and titles.</P>
<P N="8">8. The aforementioned Author also complains of other burthens imposed and daily to be imposed upon that kingdome; as of an extraordinary Donative, of cer∣tain * <HI>Granos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Granos</HI> (is as I re∣member) about an English penny, or somwhat more in value.</NOTE> which every Fire or Fa∣mily is bound to pay for the quartering of Souldiers, and for salaries to the Vice-kings Train, of seven <HI>Granos</HI> for the guard of the Towers, of five <HI>Granos</HI> for the Field-Sergeants, of nine <HI>Granos</HI> for the reparation of the wayes; of the tax for five foot Souldiers, upon a hundred fires; of yearly pensions, of the new tri∣bute put upon wrought and unwrought

<P N="10">10. He complains that the Vice-king would needs crown a certain fellow cal∣led <HI>Catinario,</HI> who was rich indeed, but not considerable otherwise, in despight of the Order of Knighthood.</P>
<P N="11">11. He complains, that he took the Princes daughter out of a Monastery by force, under pretext to try, whether she had a mind to marry, or no, when the true reason of it was, because he resolved to match her to his own son.</P>
<P N="12">12. He complains that when the States of the kingdom intended to send the Donative of the kingdome to the King by their own men, the Vice-king would needs send it by his men, and forced them to deliver it to him.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="77" REF="43"/>14.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> The Praevarications of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against Italy and the Common-wealths thereof.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be a business of too much length for me, by going through a se∣ries of Histories, to pick out all the pre∣varications of the Spaniards against <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> and the Princes and Republicks thereof, and insert them into this Narration; especially since some of them against the Pope, are already alledged, and other are to be alledged, <HI>Cap. de Praevaricationibus, &amp;c.</HI> And yet in re∣gard that though there be so various
<PB N="78" REF="44"/> Principates, and so various Common-wealths, there is yet scarce any, which complains not of the Spanish dominati∣on and ambition, it seems fit to alledge at least some of them, and omit the rest, to avoid prolixity.</P>
<P N="1">1. What monuments of their ambiti∣on they have exprest towards the Pope and his dominions, is said above. What intention they have towards the Repub∣lick of <HI>Venice,</HI> is very well known to the said common-wealth, though she think fit to dissemble it; and yet she hath not forgotten how craftily they carried themselves in the Confederation, or vvar against the <HI>Turk;</HI> and in the Controver∣sie between <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth and Her. Nor do I think the <HI>Genuezes</HI> have also forgot∣ten what their designs were against them, both in and after the time of <HI>Dory.</HI> How they seized upon the Dutchy of <HI>Milan, Sleiden</HI> shewes. In the Countreys of <HI>Pie∣mont</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> and other territories, they have erected very many monuments of their prevarications, and are daily ere∣cting more. What the <HI>Sienneses</HI> and <HI>Florentines</HI> have suffered by the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> is taught by the Historians both of this and the former Age. I willingly pass
<PB N="79" REF="44"/> by the Dutchys of <HI>Mantua, Montferat, Ferrara, Appulia,</HI> and <HI>Calabria,</HI> nor will I touch the kingdoms of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Si∣cily.</HI> because every body knows by what tricks they got those, &amp; how unworthily the Spanish Ministers treat the Noblemen and subjects thereof, insomuch as that, ac∣cording to Histories and Relations, for never so slight a cause, as sometimes for an inconsiderate word, their lives and for∣tunes are in danger.</P>

<P>THe King of <HI>Sweden</HI> smelling the Catholick Kings designs, howbeit he could hope for nothing from the house of <HI>Orange,</HI> yet he despised all the said Kings great promises, and refused him the use and loan of his great <HI>Vessels,</HI> whereof he

<P N="2">2. Nor was it without some remorse of conscience, that when <HI>Philip</HI> the se∣cond, and his Father were a dying, they desired that the business of the kingdom of <HI>Navarre</HI> might be looked into by Lawyers and learned men; to wit, because they were convinced that they held it un∣justly, by the exclusion of the right heir. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 120.</P>
<P N="3">3. The reason why the Spaniards gape for the possession of <HI>Saluces,</HI> and the Territories adjoyning, is, because they can most conveniently send Souldiers from thence into the <HI>Low-Countreys;</HI> and therefore <HI>Fontano, Anno</HI> 1600. earnestly urged the Popes <HI>Nuntio,</HI> that the King of <HI>France</HI> might yeeld up the County of <HI>Bress.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Anno</HI> 1606. there arose a contro∣versie between Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth, and the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> about certain Privi∣ledges; vvhich when it was almost brought to a friendly composition, by the endeavour of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth of <HI>France,</HI> the Spanish faction, (the chief vvhereof were Cardinall <HI>Pompeio Arri∣govio, Paulo Sfondrato,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinan∣do Pacero</HI> Duke of <HI>Ascalonia</HI>) by the pravalency of King <HI>Philips</HI> Embassador with the Pope, the businesse was not onely frustrated, but also brought to open war, and the Pope excommunica∣ted the <HI>Venetians;</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> forthwith by lettters artificiously pen'd, offered his service to the Pope, &amp; to that end <HI>Fontano</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="46"/> listed Souldiers apace; and yet never∣theless he sent <HI>Francisco de Castro,</HI> as Extraordinary, to <HI>Venice,</HI> with intenti∣on, that if the matter inclined to a peace, (which he having kindled the war at first, began already to suspect) he might praecept the honor of the pa∣cification from the King of <HI>France,</HI> or at least have a great share in it, by his intervention. But the common report in the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> was, that <HI>Philip,</HI> according to the Rule of his Ancestors, was glad to hear of such Disputes a∣mongst other Princes, concerning the Popes Supremacy, as in relation to Civil Government, yea and to have them a∣gitated up and down in <HI>Spain</HI> it self by connivencie, as conceiving them not to belong to him at all, he being very po∣tent, and using to quash the Popes at∣tempts in all his dominions with a word, well knowing that his Holinesse dares not so much as hiss against him; which was sufficiently demonstrated after∣wards in the businesse of <HI>Sicily;</HI> yea, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> boyling with the heat of ambition, convert such wars and fe∣ditions as spring from thence, to their own privat advantage; as lying in
<PB N="84" REF="47"/> ambush in the mean while, to see if any of the weaker Princes be prescribed, that so they have an occasion to invade their Dominions, as it hapned in the seizure of the kingdom of <HI>Navarre,</HI> e∣ven in our parents dayes. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 137.</P>

<P N="8">8.

<P>IF that old saying, <HI>Semper imperare, &amp; superiorem esse aliis, Alwayes to command, and be superior to others,</HI> be innate to any Nation, it is certainly so, more to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> then to any other; since all their actions, cogitations, and consultations tend to that end, and therefore they may most clearly consent and say with <HI>Caesar, Si violandum est jus,
<PB N="88" REF="49"/> regnandi causa violandum. If right must be wrong'd, it must be wrong'd for Powers sake.</HI> For this reason they are not afraid, by publick writings, to admonish and exhort their king; yea, and to shew him the wayes and means how he may arrive to the universall Monarchy, amongst whom <HI>Thomas Campanella</HI> is the Ring-leader. Nor did <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth seem to have laid slight foundations for this Monarchy, when besides those king∣doms which he possest by right of suc∣cession in the West, and elsewere, he was also made Emperour of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> to which were yet added other titles afterwards; and it hath been hi∣therto the onely business of the Spani∣ards, to be alwayes in warres, that so they may be ready upon all occasions to produce that Monarchy of the whole Christian world, which they have long since conceived. For to this end were there so many matches proposed for the <HI>Infanta Isabel,</HI> and the Crown of <HI>France</HI> so impudently as it were put to sale: to this end were the seditions raysed in <HI>Scotland, &amp;c.</HI> The same craft was used in the Bishop of <HI>Strasburghs</HI> cause, and in the Dutchy of <HI>Cleve, Gu∣lick,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="49"/> and the Imperial Citie of <HI>Aquis∣grane. Ordines ad Ernesti Lit. anno</HI> 1594. <HI>apud Thuan. lib.</HI> 109.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Spaniards hold this as a Del∣phick Oracle, and most infallible pro∣phesie, <HI>That the last Monarchy shall be fixt in Spain,</HI> and that for this reason, that in regard it came in order, from the East to the West out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Greece,</HI> and returned for a few years into <HI>Asia</HI> again, under <HI>Alexander</HI> and his succes∣sors, at length out of <HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> therefore it necessarily followes, that it must be establisht in <HI>Spain,</HI> as being the most Westward of all other Countreys. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 133.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Spaniards for the setling of their Monarchy by warres, fraud, and other plots, destroy as many as are able to oppose them; as <HI>Anno</HI> 1584. when <HI>Andino</HI> (according to most mens opini∣ons) was poysoned, whereof he being dead, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was also forthwith killed, by one hired of the Duke of <HI>Parma;</HI> and the Queen of <HI>England</HI> aimd at by the same Arts, at the same time, <HI>lib.</HI> 79.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the kings of <HI>Spain</HI> labour for nothing more, then by subduing all
<PB N="90" REF="50"/> other Kings and Princes, to make them∣selves Monarchs of the whole Christian world, <HI>Ancellus</HI> teaches in his speech to the Princes of <HI>Germany, Anno</HI> 1597. <HI>apud Thuan. lib.</HI> 118.</P>
<P N="8">8. At the election of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1519. one of the Episcopall E∣lectors said, <HI>That the Spaniards having once gotten the Empire, would hardly re∣store it again to its liberty.</HI> Sleidanus.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Spaniards for the better se∣curity of their Monarchy, do not only permit, but allow, and perswade, even incestuous marriages, lest by the division of kingdoms, forsooth, their Monar∣chy should suffer an eclipse. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 107.</P>
<P N="10">10. Moreover, for the greater assu∣rance of their said Monarchy, they la∣bour to destroy the Noblemen of their Provinces; to streighten their privi∣ledges &amp; liberties, to impose new taxes, and to reduce the inhabitants from their old plenty and riches, to poverty and misery. <HI>Ordines Belgici in responsione Schwartzenburgio, Legato Caesario data anno</HI> 1575. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 60.</P>

<P>AS the Spaniards fall short of no na∣tion in the breaking of Promises and Engagements, so do they also excell in the Art, and skill of Hypocrisie and dissimulation, whereof there be many old and modern examples; amongst which, that great one of <HI>Philip</HI> the second
<PB N="102" REF="56"/> may be noted, who when <HI>Anno</HI> 1579, he invaded the kingdom of <HI>Portugall</HI> with his Army, and knew well enough notwithstanding, what sinister reports went up and down of him, not onely in <HI>Portugal,</HI> but even in <HI>Italy</HI> too, finding it fit to indulge Fame a little, by a dissi∣mulation very familiar to him, as if he had repented himself of that enterprise, would needs have the whole businesse examined by the Rule of Conscience: for, on the one side he found himself sollicited by the Pope, and on the other, censured by the opinion of men, as if he had violently invaded anothers kingdom, (having calculated the Title in Law to which the weaker submitted) and consequently opprest the liberty of the kingdom which he ambitionated, &amp; the States therof complaining, that their right was thereby taken from them; and alledging besides, that they were bound by oath not to obey him; for the avoid∣ing of which difficulties without difficul∣ty, he committed the business to the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vines, an Assembly of Divines to be discust at leasure, who forthwith gave him their votes, affirming, <HI>That he ought not to submit the disputation of his right

<P N="1">1. To begin with <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, he most dishonorably removed <HI>Ferdinando Gonzaga,</HI> who had highly deserved of him, from the government of <HI>Milan,</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="57"/> deprived him of all command and dignity, and most ungratefully &amp; unmercifully put him to death: Which fact is not yet so much imputed to the Emperour, as to the envy of the Duke of <HI>Alva.

<P N="10">10.

Cardinall <HI>Perron,</HI> and others agree in this opinion; for in his speech to Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth, concerning the pacifica∣tion vvith the <HI>Venetians,</HI> he argues thus; <HI>That the Spaniards through their in-begot∣ten ambition, would make use of their time, and so it would come to passe, that his Holi∣nesse by the Sectaries on the one side, and the Spaniards on the other (who sell them∣selves for Auxiliaries) would be most un∣happily endangered &amp; vext.</HI> And presently after, <HI>The Spanish succour will be unsafe, and very small besides; for they are for the most part burthensome, and importunate to their friends.

<PB N="113" REF="61"/> chief of the <HI>Henotick</HI> faction, and the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> were encreased by sus∣pitions, as if the said Duke by king <HI>Phi∣lips</HI> order, had undertaken an Expedi∣tion into <HI>France,</HI> that so under shew of friendship and aid, he might take all the authority from <HI>Meduanio,</HI> and put∣ting Garrisons into the places taken, op∣press the French, who aspired to liberty with the hard yoak of slavery. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 99.</P>
<P N="6">6. For the succour which the Spani∣ards gave the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> in the controversie about <HI>Cleve</HI> and <HI>Gulick,</HI> neither the said Duke himself, nor any of his subjects, have any great reason to thank them: for they did not only ex∣haust those Principates, but carried all things according to their pleasure, as if forsooth they had been the lawfull Lords thereof.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Spaniards under shew and pre∣text of succouring their sociates and con∣federates, seek how themselves may be able to surprize and draw Cities to their own power and possession; which had almost hapned to the Citizens of <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>France, Anno</HI> 1594. had they not per∣ceived the fraud, and reconciled them∣selves

Thus was the kingdom of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> (which are o∣therwise carried by election) and thus was the Common-wealth of <HI>Genua</HI> sub∣dued, under the colour of protection.

<P N="1">1. That the Spaniards have this Art in daily practice, the better to advance

<P N="2">2. The marriages with the daughters of <HI>Spain</HI> have scarce succeeded well to any; for either they have been barren, as <HI>Eugenia</HI> was; or the causes of warres, as the Duke of <HI>Savoyes</HI> wife was; or scrues into the secrets of the Princes their husbands, as those of the house of <HI>Austria</HI> are <HI>Anonymus.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>Anno</HI> 1582. when the Spaniards and French fought at the <HI>Tercera</HI> Island, <HI>Santa Cruz</HI> the Spanish Generall, left the German Souldiers to <HI>Hieronymo Ladron,</HI> to punish them as he pleased. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 75.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Ancellus</HI> in his speech to the Prin∣ces of <HI>Germany, Anno</HI> 1597. sayes, <HI>That the King of Spain was not so well affected towards Germany, in regard he plainly neg∣lected the imminent danger of his common countrey from the Turk, and assisted the Emperour and his Countrey-men with so small succours: And moreover, that he sought his own advancement by the over∣throw of the house of Austria.

<P>That the Spaniards shew bread in one hand, and hide a stone in the o∣ther;
<PB N="121" REF="65"/> treat peace, and prepare for war, shall be proved in this Chapter.</P>
<P N="1">1. In that treaty of the Emperour <HI>Maximilian,</HI> the Spaniards basely, and deceitfully guld the Princes, by taking the Towns of <HI>Boure, Leerdam, Schoon∣hof, Owdtwateren, Bommel,</HI> and <HI>Zir∣zea.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Pacification and Union of <HI>Gant,</HI> 1576. was sworn to and approved of by king <HI>Philip,</HI> but not kept.</P>
<P N="3">3. The conference at <HI>Colein</HI> was pre∣tended to be liked of, but in the <HI>Inte∣rim,</HI> the people of <HI>Hennault, Arras,</HI> and <HI>Mastricht,</HI> were sollicited to disloy∣alty.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Conference being begun in <HI>Flanders,</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Deputies were also invited to it; and in the mean while, that formidable Fleet, <HI>anno</HI> 1588. was prepared and sent to surprize <HI>Eng∣land. Thuan. lib.</HI> 119. where the States at large express the fraudulent Arts of the Spaniards.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the Spaniards peace is not to be trusted to, is taught by the Lords of the United Provinces in their answer to the Emperour <HI>Rodolph, Anno</HI> 1591. and there was many stampt by them at that
<PB N="122" REF="66"/> time, with this Emblem, A <HI>Holland</HI> vir∣gin fits sweetly sleeping under a quick-set hedge, with this adscription, <HI>Pax pa∣tet insidiis:</HI> and upon a sudden her ene∣mies break through the hedge, assault and surprize her. Then she sits again under another hedge waking, with a Sword and a Guard by her, with these words, <HI>Tuta salus bello est;</HI> and the breach being stopt, the enemies designes are frustrated. <HI>Luckius in Numismatis.</HI> p. 328.</P>
<P N="6">6. When the Truce was made be∣tween <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> the Spaniards said, <HI>That the King made a step back∣wards, thereby to leap the further forwards upon occasion.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. That the conditions of the truce were not candidly and sincerely kept by the Spaniards, may appear by the States answer to <HI>Peck.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. It is undoubted, that the Spaniards treat peace to no other end, then to collect their forces, and work their de∣signes by any means they can to scrue in∣to the secrets of their adversaries, to corrupt some, and draw them to their party; and to sow the seed of discord amongst others, which hath been tried

<P>THe Kings of Spain have learned to fight as well with silver and golden pikes, as their Souldiers with iron ones; yea, and perhaps they effect ten times more with those then these; and there∣fore they spare no Bribes, how great so∣ever,
<PB N="124" REF="67"/> to the Councellors and Secre∣taries of Kings and Princes, to render them obnoxious to themselves; or to tempt and seduce the Governors of Towns and Castles, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Nicolas Hosta Villaroy's</HI> Secretary, had a yearly pention of MCC crowns to reveal his Masters secrets to the Spa∣niards; who when the business was dis∣covered, endeavouring to save himself by flight, was drowned, and his body proceeded against according to Law. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 132.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Charles Howard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Notting∣ham,</HI> being Embassador in Spain <HI>Anno</HI> 1605. had ptesents made him by that king, which were said to be worth above XXXM pounds, besides the presents sent to his wife, his sons, and son in law; yea, and <HI>Willongs, Norrice,</HI> and others of his train, were also richly presented; &amp; finally, a pension of XIIM pounds (as it is reported) promised the said Em∣bassador. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 133.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Spaniards offered the Coun∣sellors of <HI>Frederick,</HI> Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> a great sum of money at the election of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth; and they asking their foresaid Master; whether they should

<P N="5">5. <HI>Ancellus</HI> in his speech to the Princes of Germany, <HI>Anno</HI> 1597. sayes, <HI>That the King of</HI> Spain <HI>uses all means possible to corrupt the Ministers of Prin∣ces with gifts and bribes; yea, and some∣times also with menaces, and by their means to get their Masters into his pow∣er, and under colour of Protection to cir∣cumvent them, and hurry them up and down at his pleasure.</HI></P>

For how many of the prime Nobi∣lity did the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> destroy, part∣ly by the hand of the Executioner, and partly by the warres? &amp;c. He condem∣ned them promiscuously, both Gentle and Simple, to nasty Jayls, caused many of them to be drag'd to death unheard, and unconvicted; confiscated their E∣states: The Trees through all <HI>Holland</HI> he made frequently serve for Gallows, where men were hanged, and their wives put to Spaniards against their

They rackt children before their parents, and killed them, &amp;c. whereby they got so much money, as by the computation of such as knew it, a∣mounted to forty tuns of gold, that is two millions of Pistols, besides Plate, Jewels, and other things of price. Nor was the dammage of the fire much less, where they also got so much, that a common Souldier would make nothing to play ten pistols a throw at Dice, some made Hilts to their Swords, others to their Daggers; yea, and some whole Corslets and Helmets of beaten Gold, <HI>Thuan lib.</HI> 62.</P>

Others knockt out the brains of small children, and crusht them against the Rocks and stones, sindged and burnt the bodies of some Lords and Princes of the Countries,

In <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> they destroyed above four millions of men in twelve years time, and in the Citie of <HI>Mexico,</HI> they treache∣rously massacred the flower of the No∣bility, and aftervvards many Citizens, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. The same Author also saith, That to vvrite down all the tyrannies of the Spa∣niards exercised in <HI>Guatimala,</HI> would re∣quire a Book of a foot and a half thick. Nor vvere their proceedings otherwise in <HI>Naco,</HI> and the <HI>Honduras,</HI> where in 12
<PB N="135" REF="72"/> years compasse, they destroyed above two millions of men. It was to no pur∣pose at all for the poor <HI>Indians</HI> to oblige the Spaniards; for they became the more cruel by their kindness and simplicity; as torturing them a thousand vvayes to make them confess vvhere their gold vvas, tum∣bling them into deep ditches and pits up∣on stakes pointed vvith iron, to lengthen and encrease their torments, and dragging their children into slavery, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the kingdome of <HI>Guatimala,</HI> in the space of sixteen years, they killed above five millions by various tortures: Nor gave they their prisoners any suste∣nance, but granted them leave to catch, and eat other Indians, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the kingdome of <HI>Excalisco</HI> they burnt eight hundred Villages, and sold the sons of Princes to one another for slaves. <HI>In Jucatano</HI> a Princes son was sold for a Cheese, and a hundred Indians for a horse; they hunted the Indians like wild beasts, and gave them as a see to their Dogs.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Indians</HI> have been so ill used by the Spaniards, that they abhorre the name of a Christian, and had rather dye in vvar, then live in slavery to the Spa∣niards.
<PB N="136" REF="73"/> In the kingdome of <HI>Venecula</HI> they destroyed above five millions of per∣sons, and used the like cruelty in the kingdome of <HI>Florida;</HI> as overloading the people with burthens, and when they fainted, cutting off their heads, and lea∣ving them in the high-wayes. In the Island <HI>de la Plata</HI> they killed above 1503 men at once; yea, and amongst the rest they also basely murthered such as came to serve them.</P>
<P>In the Isle of <HI>Cuba</HI> 7000 infants were starved in three moneths time, the Spani∣niards having so exhausted their mothers with continuall labour and hunger, that their breasts grew dry, and so the poor babes could not be nourished. <HI>Bartholo. de la Casa.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Spain</HI> (says <HI>de la Casa) is in great dan∣ger to be invaded and destroyed by other Na∣tions, for this tyranny.</HI> And again towards the end of his book. <HI>Ʋnless the King</HI> (sayes he) <HI>do better preserve and pro∣vide for the Indians, there is nothing more sure, then that God will most grievously punish, if not quite overthrow Spain.</HI> Thus writes, thinks and foretels a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> And his authority ought to be so much the greater, in regard he

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVIII.</HI> The rapacity, avarice, lust, adultery, and other vices of the Spaniards.</HEAD>
<P>POpe <HI>Julius</HI> the second was wont to call the Spaniards, <HI>Volucres coeli, Birds of Heaven,</HI> alluding to their pride and ambition, to outstrip and soar above all others. But since he was plea∣sed to call them <HI>Birds,</HI> why did he not rather name them <HI>Stymphalidas,</HI> or <HI>Har∣pyes,</HI> since the rapacity, theevishnesse, and greedinesse of that Nation is so well known, by extruding lawful heirs from their kingdoms, and unjustly and vio∣lently invading, seizing, and impove∣rishing them? By contaminating all
<PB N="138" REF="74"/> things, sacred, profane, private, and publick, and hooking them into their clutches? Witnesse the Kingdomes of <HI>Naples, Navarre,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> besides their rapacities and thefts in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> where it is reported by some Historians worthy of credit, that the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> drew yearly fourscore tuns of gold out of the confiscated E∣states, besides the ordinary tributes; in∣somuch as that in six years time, he ex∣torted, 52 millions of gold from those provinces.</P>
<P N="2">2. The exaction of the <HI>tenth penny</HI> upon all vendible commodities, suffici∣ently shewes their greedinesse of gold; for when the States so earnestly besee∣ched the said Duke to forbear that Tax, he answered. <HI>That he would not remit it, though all the Low-Countreys were sunk thereby, and though Heaven and Earth came together.</HI> And this was not the last and least cause why the States took Arms, and renounced their obedience to the Spaniard.</P>
<P>Many other examples there are; as of the plunder of <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Mecklin;</HI> their proceedings in <HI>Portugal</HI> and the <HI>Tercera</HI> Islands; the new Taxes against
<PB N="139" REF="74"/> the priviledges of the kingdoms of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> and the like, which are not necessary to be repeated here, in re∣gard they have been cited before in va∣rious chapters of this book.</P>
<P>But amongst other causes of the pub∣lick hatred of the Spanish Nation, their lusts and promiscuous adulteries are not to be omitted; though yet because they may seem to be excused by some, by the common example of military exorbitan∣ces, and in regard also that there be too many of them to be comprized in this short Discourse, it shall suffice to re∣mit the Reader to these Authors, <HI>Thua∣nus, Metteranus, Everardus à Raid,</HI> and others▪ however, it will not be tedious to recite some few of those which were committed by them in the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Anno</HI> 1598. When <HI>Don Francisco de Mendoza</HI> devasted the Dutchies of <HI>Gu∣lick, Cleve,</HI> and <HI>Mounts,</HI> the Spani∣ards amongst other things, plundered the Monastery of <HI>Schlehenhorst,</HI> stript the Nuns, crowded them together, and ravisht them. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 121.</P>
<P N="2">2. At the same time they bound the Judge of <HI>Dussimont</HI> in a Cellar, and
<PB N="140" REF="75"/> seven Spaniards lay with his wife before his face.</P>
<P N="8">8. In the village of <HI>Giffick</HI> they endea∣voured to ravish a Woman with child, who when she had long resisted them, they thrust a sword into her womb, and kild both her and her fruit.</P>
<P N="4">4. At <HI>Bulcholz</HI> they attempted to force the Burgomasters daughter, and her father coming to help her, they kild him, and then tied her to his dead body and ravisht her. <HI>Ibidem.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The same Author, <HI>lib.</HI> 66. recounts a generous revenge, taken by the daugh∣ter of <HI>John Milet,</HI> a Countrey man, up∣on a Spanish Captain, who had violated her chastity: and instantly after he brings another, how a Lawyers daugh∣ter revenged her self upon a Spaniard, who vitiated her, by stabbing him with his own dagger, and how at his death he left her his heir.</P>
<P N="6">6. How libidinously they carried themseves in the <HI>Indies,</HI> with all sorts of persons; yea, even with Queens them∣selves <HI>Barth. de la Casa</HI> shewes at large, in <HI>Spec. Tyran. Hisp.</HI></P>
<P>The Spaniards are also naturally (in re∣spect of other Nations) great lovers
<PB N="141" REF="75"/> and cryers up of themselves, and con∣temners of others.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thus <HI>Pedro Roycio Mauraeo,</HI> a fa∣mous Spanish Poet, at that time (to wit, 1548) being once with <HI>Langius,</HI> a German, and king <HI>Ferdinands</HI> Embassa∣dor, and hearing his servants waiting at table, speak <HI>Dutch</HI> with a hard and affe∣cted kind of tone and pronunciation, jeeringly said, <HI>The Germans do not speak, but thunder;</HI> and turning towards the Embassador, <HI>I believe</HI> (quoth he) <HI>that God out of his indignation, made use of this Thunder-bolt, when he threw our Fore∣fathers out of Paradise.</HI> To whom <HI>Lan∣gius</HI> answered, And I think it very likely on the other side, that the Serpent used this smooth and flattering Spanish tongue when he cheated <HI>Eve. Mor∣damus in vita Langii.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The presentation of the <HI>Golden Fleece</HI> was studiously and craftily inven∣ted by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to feed mens vanitie. <HI>Illicium.</HI> Thus the Emperour in king <HI>Philips</HI> name, presented <HI>Sigis∣mund Bathorius</HI> with the <HI>Golden Fleece</HI> at <HI>Prague, anno</HI> 1567.</P>
<P N="3">3. So great is the insolency of the Spaniards, that even in extream necessity
<PB N="142" REF="76"/> they cannot shew their want; which the Count of <HI>Mont-major</HI> in <HI>Sicily</HI> found with sad experience, <HI>Anno</HI> 1604. For when he was speaking to the vice-king in the behalf of the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> to mode∣rate the exportation of Corn, thereby to prevent a scarcity, or dearth, which he well foresaw was suddenly like to follow; the said vice-king took him scornfully up, as if he had spoken too sawcily to him, and caused him to be killed by his Guards before his face. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>an.</HI> 1604.</P>
<P>Many other vices of the Spaniards we have already demonstrated in other chapters of this Book, and therefore forbeare to recapitulate them here; however it be not amiss, to reiterate some few examples of their falshood and juggling, in regard that this is the main hinge upon which their most im∣portant designs depend.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the Spanish fashion easily to complain of others, when themselves are onely guilty; as <HI>Don Juan de Au∣stria</HI> did, <HI>Anno</HI> 1577. when by his Em∣bassador he accused the States of <HI>Hol∣land</HI> to the Emperour, the Electors, and the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> that they had
<PB N="143" REF="76"/> not kept the peace, when himself had broken it before. <HI>Thuan lib.</HI> 94.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Barth. de la Casa</HI> against <HI>Sepuluenda</HI> sayes, <HI>That it is not true that the Spani∣ards</HI> (as they write in the <HI>Indies</HI>) con∣verted every year so many thousand men from Gentilism to Christianism: <HI>But this</HI> (sayes he) <HI>is true indeed, that the Spaniards since their coming to the In∣dies, have butchered and sacrificed more Indians for avarice and rapacities sake, then the Indians had done to their Idols in a hundred years together: And that the Spaniards did falsly accuse the poor innocent and simple Indians to the King, of such crimes, as whereof the most wicked in the world could not be guilty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The king of Spain promised <HI>Sala∣din,</HI> Count of <HI>Isenburgh,</HI> at the taking of <HI>Mounts</HI> in <HI>Hennault,</HI> that if he would be ruled by him, he would not only make him Archbishop of <HI>Colein,</HI> but that the Citie of <HI>Colein</HI> her self should settle him as her Lord. But falsly all. <HI>Fruchches∣sius in Literis ad Colonienses apud Thuan. lib.</HI> 179.</P>
<P N="4">4. A certain <HI>Franciscan</HI> Fryar, to pre∣vail with <HI>Ferdinand</HI> king of <HI>Spain</HI> for the expulsion of the Jewes, secretly made a
<PB N="144" REF="77"/> Table of lead, wrote what he thought good therein touching the said expulsion, (with threats, &amp;c. if it were not done) hid it in a sacred place, and caused it three years after to be digged up by a Comerade of his, as if it had been some divine thing, and a Prophesie; but the king observing the fraud, neglected it. <HI>Majolus in Canicularibus</HI> 351.</P>
<P N="5">5. Howbeit envy seem to be a vice of prosperity onely, and proper to the rich, yet are the Spaniards so much possest with it, that it seems to be as it were hereditary to them; as <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 75. sayes of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> That he was most am∣bitious in confidence of his own merits. A Detractor of the vertue of others; and (by the vice of his Countrey) contu∣melious towards other Nations, and im∣perious and severe to such as were just. And by and by, <HI>The envy and hatred of the Duke of</HI> Alva (sayes he) <HI>made</HI> Charles <HI>the fifth deal so ungratefully with</HI> Gonzaga. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIX.</HI> Other Arts and Tricks of the Spaniards to work their Designes.</HEAD>
<P>THe other wayes which the Spani∣ards use for the acquisition of King∣doms, are very many, but chiefly six: 1. <HI>Perswasions to the people, and mercena∣ry sermons, especially of the Jesuits.</HI> Thus was it carried in that <HI>French League,</HI> a∣gainst <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and in the acquest of the king∣dom of <HI>Portugal</HI> by the Jesuits. 2. <HI>Force of Armes.</HI> 3. <HI>Bribes and Corruptions.</HI> 4. <HI>Marriages and Alliances.</HI> 5. <HI>Presen∣tations of the Golden Fleece to various Lords of the Spanish Ʋnion.</HI> 6. <HI>If they suspect any one, to destroy him,</HI> as they did <HI>Egmund, Horn,</HI> and the <HI>Battenburghs, &amp;c.</HI> Or if that cannot be done, to send him by all means out of their Territories, as they intended to do <HI>Mansfeldt,</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Orange,</HI> by making them Generals against the Turk, with large praises of their valor and prudence. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 120.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Spaniards ever have, and still do, take extreamly ill the Confederation
<PB N="146" REF="78"/> of the <HI>Swissers</HI> with the <HI>French;</HI> and therefore when <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1602. desired to renew it, <HI>Fontano</HI> Go∣vernour of <HI>Milan,</HI> moved every stone to hinder it, <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 129.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a very familiar thing with the Spaniards to hinder Leagues and Con∣federacies, thereby to obtain their ends. Thus <HI>Pedro Guzman, Toledo, Fontano,</HI> Vice-king of <HI>Lumbardy, Anno</HI> 1605. to disturb the confederation contracted between the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Swissers,</HI> made severe proclamations at <HI>Milan,</HI> wherby he inconvenienc't the commerce of both, and at an appointed place, (<HI>viz.</HI> a Rock five miles from <HI>Nova-Camo,</HI> having <HI>Clavenna</HI> and the <HI>Veltelin</HI> on each side) built a Castle with five <HI>Forts Royal,</HI> and called it by his own name, to hinder the importation of Corn to the neighbouring parts: yea, and he sowed so many seeds of dissen∣tion amongst the <HI>Swissers,</HI> that it was like to have proved their utter ruine. <HI>Thuan.</HI> 134.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth seeing <HI>Genua</HI> to be a convenient place, as well for other causes, as chiefly for the transportation of Forces out of <HI>Spain</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> and
<PB N="147" REF="78"/> therefore intending to fortifie it, could never bring <HI>Dory,</HI> either by threats or promises, to give way to the building of a Castle in it, that is, to the putting of a yoak upon his Countrey; wherefore he thought fit to take another course to bridle the Citie, which was to borrow the <HI>Genuezes</HI> money (which is upon the matter their whole support) at what rate they pleased; conceiving that there∣by he should quickly (by degrees) draw the wealth of those greedy men to him∣self, and so have the Citie in his debt, that is, the affections of the Citi∣zens at his disposal. Which trick his son <HI>Philip,</HI> in imitation of his fathers example, being involved in the <HI>Low-countrey</HI> war (which was hugely ex∣pensive) used and took occasion to draw vast sums of money of the principall of the Nobility, for which he paid huge interest, and assigned the chief taxes of the Indies and Spain for the paiment thereof. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 61.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Anno</HI> 1577. Some letters of Don <HI>Juan de Austria</HI> to king <HI>Philip,</HI> were intercepted, wherein amongst other things, they advised him to sow discord between the Gentry and Commonalty
<PB N="148" REF="79"/> of the Low-Countries about Religion and liberty of conscience. <HI>lib.</HI> 64.</P>
<P>It was the Maxim of <HI>Escovedo,</HI> and now of the Spaniards in general <HI>to breed and cherish dissention amongst the Princes of the world, that so since they could not check them altogether, they might check them apart.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Spaniards permit no Councels or Assemblies amongst their Noblemen▪ because they hold them very prejudiciall to their affairs, and therefore they flatly prohibited them to the Lords of the kingdom of <HI>Portugal. Thuan. lib.</HI> 78. <HI>Anno</HI> 1583.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another of the Spanish practices is, to take lawfull heirs out of the Do∣minions of their ancestors, as they did <HI>Anno</HI> 1583. when <HI>Augusta, Philips</HI> sister, under colour of visiting a Monastery of Nuns, took away <HI>Julian</HI> of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> Heiress to the Principate of <HI>Avern,</HI> to the high displeasure of the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> who conceived themselves by this exam∣ple, to be hurried into a wretched capti∣vity to the <HI>Castillians. Thuan lib.</HI> 78.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Spaniards in the Duke of <HI>Al∣vas</HI> time, made it their business to pro∣voke the <HI>Low countrey</HI> men to novelty
<PB N="149" REF="79"/> and war, by diminishing and taking a∣way their Priviledges and Immunities; yea, and they openly boasted, that that was the onely thing they aimed at, that so they might have a fairer pretext to rifle the goods and estates of the people, and destroy Cities and Provinces. <HI>Spec. Hisp. Tyran. in Belgio. p.</HI> 35. Thus the aforesaid Duke stript the Citizens of <HI>Ʋtrick</HI> of their priviledges, <HI>Anno</HI> 1571. And thus also did the Spaniards in this age of ours, serve the <HI>Catalonians, &amp;c. Status Barcenonenses, &amp; Catalauni in quer. sua Cath. hinc inde, imprimis, c.</HI> 8.12.29.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Spaniards, if at any time, any Commander or Governor of theirs, commit any remarkable crime, to save themselves, lay hold of some poor, inno∣cent and undeserving Souldier or other, and sacrifice him to the Hangman to sa∣tisfie for their wickedness. One example wherof is related by <HI>Janus Duza Satyra.</HI> 40, <HI>sub finem:</HI> and the like was also done heretofore in the mutiny at <HI>Ʋtrick,</HI> and at the firing of <HI>Duiburgh</HI> in <HI>Cleve.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Thomas Campanella, Disc. de Monar, Hisp. c.</HI> 14. sayes, <HI>Care must be taken that the sons of such Lords and Noblemen as
<PB N="150" REF="80"/> live in Kingdomes distant from</HI> Spain, <HI>and under the Spanish Government, may have Spaniards to their Tutors to Hispaniolize them in habit, manners, and customes; and when they are grown potent they must be humbled, and under pretext of honor, be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣patcht to some Office or employment, farre from their Lordships, where they may spend more then they get; and if the King chance to go on progress, he should do well to lodge at their houses, thereby to put them to ex∣traordinary charges.</HI> And he further saith <HI>chap.</HI> 15. <HI>That as soon as the King hath conquered any Nation, he must take away the immoveable goods of the people, allow them only food and clothing, and make them till the earth, forcing their sons to be either Souldiers or Husbandmen.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Nor must this practice of the Spa∣niards be past over in oblivion, namely, that they use to call Lords and Earles, and such as are richest, and most in pow∣er and favour with the people, in any of their Dominions, to the kings Court, un∣der any pretext whatsoever, as of bear∣ing an Embassie, or commanding an Ar∣my, &amp;c. out of hope whereof they are not wont to appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r without great mag∣nificence and sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endor; and when they
<PB N="151" REF="80"/> have made their appearance, the Spani∣ards pretending sometimes one thing, and sometimes another, delay and de∣tain them, not only one, but many years, till by expectation they have spent, and wasted the greatest part of their estates, and are fain to pawn them to others. And this practice they chiefly observe in the kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXX.</HI> The various Apothegmes and Observations concerning the Spaniards.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain Spaniard called <HI>Ferdinando Soto,</HI> coming into the Isle of <HI>Florida</HI> said, <HI>He was the son of God;</HI> to whom one of the natives answered, <HI>If your God, whose son thou sayst thou art, commands you to invade the Dominions, Provinces, and E∣states of others, and there to kill, slay, snatch, wrest, steal, spoyle, whore, adul∣terate, &amp;c. we tell you plainly, that we cannot believe in such a God.</HI></P>
<P>Another <HI>Indian</HI> speaking with <HI>Hierony∣mo Benzoon,</HI> said, <HI>What kind of people are these Christians? They take away our bread,
<PB N="152" REF="81"/> our hony, our sugar, our cloathes, our wives, our daughters, our silver, our gold, and what ever we hold dear. They will not work, they are cheaters, theeves, robbers, &amp; plunde∣rers; before they go to Mass, they brawle scuffle, and hurt one another.</HI> And when <HI>Benzon</HI> told him they were not all such, he replied, <HI>I never yet saw a good and ho∣nest Spaniard. Joan. Petit. in Chron. Holland. lib.</HI> 6.</P>
<P><HI>Martin Luther</HI> was wont to say, <HI>That as the Spaniards write otherwise then they read, so they think otherwise then they speak.</HI></P>
<P>At the siege of <HI>Frankendal,</HI> a certain Captain fell into the hands of the Spani∣ards, who bidding him yeeld himself, and they would give him quarter: he cryed out aloud, I <HI>will have no quarter of the Spaniard, but quarter in heaven;</HI> and so after he had received many wounds, dyed with his sword in his hand.</P>
<P>The Spaniards having once petitioned <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth to remove all the drun∣ken Germans from his Court, he at length convocated all the Germans, and shewing them the petition of the Spaniards, pre∣tended to go along with them; which the Spaniards perceiving, most earnestly be∣sought him to stay. <HI>Idem. pag.</HI> 94.</P>
<PB N="153" REF="81"/>
<P>A certain Spanish Captain asked a sub∣ject of the <HI>Palatin,</HI> why they so strong∣ly and faithfully adhered to their Prince, since he had been the cause of their being so opprest and exhausted in war by stran∣gers? The other answered, <HI>Why should we not love him, and stick close to him; for we paid not so much to him in a whole year, as to you in a moneth? Znickgref. p.</HI> 1. <HI>Apo∣theg. p.</HI> 336.</P>
<P>A certain Gascon called <HI>Pyrrhinuncu∣le,</HI> coming to his Inne, and having a Duck∣lin oyld and garlickt, set to Table, a Spanish traveller suddenly stept in, and casting his eye upon the Ducklin, <HI>Sir,</HI> (quoth he) <HI>may a friend be welcom to you?</HI> What is your name sir, said the <HI>Gascon?</HI> the Spaniard strutted and answered, Don <HI>Alopanzo Ansimarchides, Hiberoneus A∣lorchides.</HI> Marry out, quoth the <HI>Gascon, Four Spanish Lorsd to one poor little Bird? God forbid: here is but enough for Pyrrhi∣nuncle alone;</HI> for small things become small persons. <HI>Simon Majolus in Canicu∣laribus. p.</HI> 326.</P>
<P>The Spaniards traduced the Germans to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, (and especially the Souldlers) intreating him to make a pro∣clamation, to forbid them drunkenness, To
<PB N="154" REF="82"/> whom he answered, <HI>I should effect as much with them by such a Proclamation, as I should with you, by forbidding you fornica∣cation, adultery, and rapacity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hector Vogelman,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Wir∣tenbergh,</HI> being asked by Duke <HI>Frederick</HI> his Master, what rarities he had seen in Spain, answered, <HI>Mountains of pride, and vallies of tears, and happy is he who believes it without going to see it.</HI></P>
<P>A Spaniard seeing a Fleming at dinner with a boyld Capon without Limmons, cryed out with great vvonder, <HI>What is a Capon without Limmons?</HI> The Fleming answered, <HI>And what are Limmons without a Capon?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spinola,</HI> at the treaty of the Truce be∣tween the King of Spain and the States, shewed Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> some golden Ap∣ples and Citrons, and bragged that they grew twice a year in Spain; but the Prince shewed him a <HI>Holland Cheese,</HI> and said, <HI>This Fruit growes every day with us in Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bartholome de la Casa,</HI> a Spanish Bi∣shop so often cited in this Book, <HI>lib. de Descrip. Tyran. Hispan. in India.</HI> De∣scribes the Spaniards with various Epi∣thets, and Titles, and amongst others he
<PB N="155" REF="82"/> sayes, <HI>That they are hellish Tyrants, plun∣derers of the Empire, that by too much gree∣diness of gold, they sold, and still sell, denyed, and still deny Jesus Christ,; that they are not Christians, but Divels;</HI> Not servants of God, or Ministers of their King, but Traytors, Destroyers, Robbers, and O∣verthrowers of the Lawes and Ordinances of their King, Villains, fell Tygers, de∣vouring Wolves, fierce Lyons, pestilent men, more mischievous then any plague from heaven, voracious Dragons, wild Beasts, Butchers, Hangmen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Book intituled, <HI>Speculum Indiae oc∣cident.</HI> printed at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in Lowe Dutch, sayes thus, <HI>A Spaniard is like the Divel, the more good a man does him, the more will he plague him; but such as value him not, and care not for him, he lets alone.</HI></P>
<P>The Nobility of the Kingdome of <HI>Maguara,</HI> being advised by the Spa∣niards, to render themselves to the obedience of the king of Spain, and embrace the Christian Religion, said amongst themselves, <HI>That they could not perceive, that they should receive a better Religion then they should forsake, in regard</HI> (say they) <HI>that we see no more good nor righteousness in their actions, then in our
<PB N="156" REF="83"/> own; and our faith does us no hurt, as long as our Gods defend our religion, and are favourably inclined thereto. But their reli∣gion brings us much mischief and unsafety, and therefore neither can their Gods be good, nor can the Christians be any where welcom, for that they endeavour to overthrow and extirpate such mercifull Gods, and such a merciful Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth being to depart out of the Low-Countries for Spain, most earnestly commended those Provinces, and the Nobility thereof, for their singular faith and loyalty to∣wards him (for vvhich indeed he extraor∣dinarily loved them) to <HI>Philip</HI> 2. his son, exhorting him to love them, cherish them, and advance them as his most faith∣full subjects, and not to shew too much favour to the Spaniards, (vvhose na∣tures he very well knew, as having had them alwayes about him), nor suffer them to contemn, oppress, or in any wise abuse the said Nobility and subjects. <HI>For</HI> (said he) <HI>I very much suspect the innate haugh∣tiness and pride of the Spaniards, if they get to the helm of the Government, they should convert, pervert, and evert all, and run the ship against the Rocks.</HI> And some

But <HI>Philip</HI> quickly forgot this advice of his Fathers, and trusted chiefly to the perswasions of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and consequently both he, and his Succes∣sors, received such fruit as they desired not from them.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I Have now shewed you enough, and more then enough indeed of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and yet if any body fall short of his satisfaction herewith, I remit him to the various Authors, which I have cited, and alledged in this small Book. But methinks it should suffice the cour∣teous reader as wel as it doth me for the present, to have demonstrated that there
<PB N="158" REF="84"/> is no Nation which hath given more and greater testimonies and prejudices of prevarications and exorbitations both in this and in the other world, then the Spaniards; &amp; therefore have they most deservingly incurred the hatred of all other nations. I will add no more, but onely declare in this writing, that such as (either blinded by the Spaniards gold, or inticed by their briberies) make it no scruple of conscience to serve them to the destruction of their Coun∣trey, Religion, and Liberty, do not only not perform the duty of good Patriots, or true-born men of their said Coun∣trey, but are rather <HI>Sinons,</HI> who lay o∣pen the walls, and gates thereof to the common enemy, and make a bridge for the <HI>Trojan</HI> Horse to come to invade, fire, and destroy our <HI>Ilion,</HI> ah truly <HI>Ilion!</HI> But God avert that evil both from them and us. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
