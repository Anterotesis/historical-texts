<P>BY a Letter from Admiral <HI>Russell,</HI> dated the 24th Instant, when he was at an Anchor before <HI>la Hogue,</HI> we have this Account, That the Admiral, having the day before sent Vice-Admiral <HI>Rooke,</HI> with a Squadron of Ships and Fire-Ships, and all the Boats in the Fleet, to burn the Ships that were there penned up; it succeeded so well, that six were burnt that Night, and six more the next Morning. Of these, six were Three-Deck-Ships, and the other six from Sixty to Seventy Guns, and one Ship of Fifty six Guns was overset, and utterly lost; so that the whole num∣ber in that Bay was destroy'd. The Men in the Boats behaved themselves so bravely, that they took possession of several of the Enemies Ships, and beat the <HI>French</HI> with their own Guns from their Platforms.</P>
<P>The Fleet is now so disposed upon the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> that if there be any more <HI>French</HI> Ships thereabouts, we may hope to have a good Account of them.</P>
