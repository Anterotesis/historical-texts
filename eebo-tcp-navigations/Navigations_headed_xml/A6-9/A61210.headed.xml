<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Treatise would not be so fami∣liar, as to
presume upon so high a Patronage, were not your Grace so imme∣mediately
interessed, and con∣cerned therein. Neither was it without some serious
Reslexion and Debate, that I could resolve to make this Present to your
Grace: For though Dedications are lately grown so Epidemical, that no
Person of Quality, ei∣ther <PB REF="3"/>sooner or later can avoid the
Infection, yet, methought, your Grace was as much above the common
disturbances that attend your Quality, as you are exalted above the common
Level of it. But, my Lord, you are now go∣ing General of an Expedition, in
whose very Name encounter an admirable Policy, and a certain Glory; for the
Service of which was principally intended this en∣suing Description. This
it is which made me conclude I should have done a great Injustice, had I
put this Tract under any other Protection than yours. And in∣deed at whose
Feet can a Sub∣ject of this Nature be so fit∣ly placed as at your Grace's,
You being so experienc'd a Commander, and about to per∣form <PB REF="3"/>such vast important Acti∣ons?</P>
<P>My Lord, it would but ar∣gue me of the meanest Imper∣tinence to
pretend here an Ha∣rangue of those Encomiums you deserve: For he who
acquaints the World whose Son you are, has said enough to those who do
not know you: Your Grace being the best Panegyrick upon your self: The Son
of the Great, the Immortal <HI>Schomberg,</HI> whose stupendious Actions,
and invin∣cible Courage, together with his unspotted Zeal for the most
ra∣tional Religion of the World, at a time when the Thorns of Persecution
forced him from his Estate and Dignities, have ren∣dred him even above the
<HI>Tu∣rennee's,</HI> <PB REF="4"/>the <HI>Montecuculli's,</HI> and the
<HI>Condees,</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Caesars</HI> of our Age.</P>
<P>Go on, my Lord, and prosper; And whilst your glorious Father's
Blood inheres in you, where's the considering Man that questions Victory,
ordares dispute Success.</P>
<P>Methinks, I hear the Men of <HI>Gaul</HI> declare, amazed upon the
Notice of your Landing, He comes, 'tis <HI>Schomberg</HI>'s Son, why do we
defer to yield?</P>
<P>We read in English History of the prodigious Actions of the
Mighty <HI>Talbot,</HI> whose very Name at last was of sufficient force
to defeat whole Armies: The Case being parallel to the great Exploits of your
Renown∣ed <PB REF="4"/>Father, of whom your Grace is a compleat Resemblance,
how can it be, that we should fear a Victory?</P>
<P>The Present that I make bold to send your Grace, is a
Geo∣graphical Description of <HI>France,</HI> considered in its several
Pro∣vinces, the most considerable Cities and Sea Ports, their Distances
one from another, their Longi∣tudes and Latitudes, what they are most
remarkable for, toge∣ther with many other observable things, that
necessarily occur in a Treatise of this Nature.</P>
<P>But lest I prove tedious, I will conclude this Epistle with
assuring you, that not only this Book, but the Author of it are <PB REF="5"/>both Dedicated to your Grace's Service, (with hearty Prayers for the
Success of your Expe∣dition) by him, who in all ima∣ginable Humility,
subscribes him∣self,</P>

<HEAD>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE Geographical Description OF
FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Romans gave the Name of <HI>Gaul</HI> to that extent of Land,
which is between the <HI>Alpes</HI> and the <HI>Pyrenaeans,</HI> the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI>-Sea, the Ocean, and the <HI>Rhine:</HI> At present,
with an exception of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and some other Parts, which
do as it were depend upon the Empire of <HI>Ger∣many;</HI> it is called
<HI>France,</HI> from the Name of the <HI>French,</HI> who made it sub∣ject 
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>to their Power. <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> had finished his
Conquest of it about Forty Eight Years before the Nativity of Je∣sus
Christ; insomuch that when the French had absolutely established
them∣selves therein, it had been near Five A∣ges under the Laws of that
Empire.</P>
<P>Now without reckoning the Coun∣try which the <HI>Gauls</HI> had
subdued be∣yond the <HI>Alps,</HI> from these Mountains, as far as the
little River of <HI>Rubicon,</HI> and which was named <HI>Cisalpine
Gaul,</HI> in re∣spect of the Romans: It was first di∣vided by
<HI>Augustus</HI> into Four Parts, <HI>Narbonoise Gaul,</HI> which they
called <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI> because they had subdued it first, and reduced
it into a Province; <HI>Aqui∣tanick Gaul, Gaul Celtick,</HI> and <HI>Gaul
Bel∣gick.</HI> To these three last, they gave the Name of <HI>Gaul
Cheveliie,</HI> and when <HI>Gaul</HI> was absolutely spoken,
<HI>Celtick</HI> was understood. Then by Succession of time, and under
divers Emperors, it was divided again into Seventeen Pro∣vinces, to wit, Five
<HI>Viennoises,</HI> in which number were computed the First and Second
<HI>Narbonoise;</HI> Three <HI>Aquitains;</HI> Five <HI>Lyonnoises,</HI>
comprehending the <HI>Se∣quanoise;</HI> Four <HI>Belgick,</HI> Two of which
were called <HI>German,</HI> because some People <PB N="3" REF="7"/>of
<HI>Germany</HI> had long since inhabited those parts; and Two
<HI>Belgick,</HI> proper∣ly so called.</P>
<P>Each of these Provinces had its Me∣tropolis; to wit, the Five
<HI>Viennoise, Vi∣enna, Narbonne, Aix, Tarentaise,</HI> and
<HI>Embrun;</HI> the Three <HI>Aquitains, Bourges, Bourdeaux</HI> and
<HI>Eaulse;</HI> the Five <HI>Lyon∣noises, Lyon, Rouën, Tours, Sens,
Besancon;</HI> The Two <HI>German, Mentz</HI> and <HI>Cologne;</HI> the Two
<HI>Belgick, Triers</HI> and <HI>Rheims.</HI></P>
<P>Under these Seventeen Metropoli∣tans, there was above a Hundred
Cities or Towns, Heads of People, in which the Church has since constituted
Epis∣copal Sees. Under these Cities, there was a much greater number of
other Towns, which they called <HI>Oppida.</HI> When the Romans conquered
<HI>Gaul,</HI> there was no less computed than Twelve Hundred with Walls; but
they pulled down the Enclosures of the greatest part, or let them fall to
ruin.</P>
<P>As to the Governments of these Se∣venteen Provinces, Six of them
were Consular, and Eleven under Presidents, commissioned by the
Emperor. <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> the Great, put Counts into the Cities, and
Dukes into some of the Frontier Towns; Judiciary matters <PB N="4" REF="8"/>were performed according to the Ro∣man Law, but some Municipal
Customs it's probable were kept up. They were not much disturbed by the
Soldiery, because the Legions lived with sufficient order, and besides
there was hardly any but in the Adjacent Provinces. Yet as the Country was
agreeable and fertile, and the People extreamly subject, they were imposed
upon by all manner of Ex∣actions, insomuch that their Abundance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> encreased their Misery, and
their Obe∣dience heigthned their Oppression.</P>
<P>In the Year 330, when <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great divided the
Charge of <HI>Prefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣du
Pretoire</HI> into Four, <HI>Gaul</HI> enjoyed one, who had under him Three
Vicars one in <HI>Gaul</HI> it self, one in <HI>Spain,</HI> and one in
<HI>Great Britain.</HI> The First who had this Charge, was the Father of St.
<HI>Ambrose,</HI> bearing the same Name as his Son. This Praefect usually
resided in the City of <HI>Triers,</HI> which for this rea∣son was the
Capital of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> till having been Four times sack'd by the
Barbarians, the Emperor <HI>Honorius</HI> would transfer this Prerogative to
the City of <HI>Arles;</HI> which was at length taken off from <HI>Vienna,</HI>
and made up the Eigh∣teenth Metropolis.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<P>From <HI>Augustus</HI> to <HI>Galien,</HI> the Peace of these
Provinces was disturbed by. Two Revolts that of <HI>Sacrovir</HI> and
<HI>Flo∣rus</HI> in the Twenty Third Year of Je∣sus Christ, and that of
<HI>Civilis, Tutor &amp; Classicus,</HI> which was much more dangerous in
the Year 70. After the Death of the Emperor <HI>Decius,</HI> the Barba∣rians
began to torment them by frequent Incursions. For the First Hundred Years
there were none but French and Ger∣mans that were concerned in them on this
side the <HI>Rhine;</HI> but afterwards the Misfortune was redoubled by the
hor∣rible Devastations of Vandals, Bourguig∣nons, Sueves, Visigoths and
Huns, which did not end but with the ruin of the Empire in the West.</P>
<P>As to the Original of the French, the common opinion is, that they
are na∣tural Germans, and that <HI>France</HI> is the name of a League, which
in their Lan∣guage signified <HI>Free,</HI> or as others say, <HI>Fierce,
Insuperable.</HI> 'Tis certain that the Authors of the Third and Fourth Ages
by the name of <HI>German,</HI> almost always mean the <HI>French.</HI> As
for the time in which they began to appear, it was exactly Two Years after the
great Defeat of the Emperor <HI>Decius</HI> in <HI>Mesia,</HI> 
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>which happened in the Year 254, by the Goths and other People
of <HI>Seythia,</HI> The Goths had begun to make them∣selves known but Twelve
Years before they went out of their own Country, which was <HI>European
Scythia,</HI> between the <HI>Euxin</HI> Sea and the River <HI>Tanais,</HI>) to
ransack the Provinces of the Empire. They were divided into
<HI>Ostrogoths</HI> and <HI>Visigoths;</HI> that is to say, according to,
some Eastern Goths and Western Goths.</P>
<P>After this Defeat, all the Fences of the Roman Empire being
ruinated on that side, there broke out Torrents of all sorts of Barbarians,
who had not been so much as heard of till then. 'Tis for this reason
amongst others, and be∣cause the French had also much of the Behaviors
and Customs of the Scythians, (as to use Darts, to exercise Hawk∣ing,
&amp;c.) that one is apt to conjecture that they are originally Scythians. But
it is not po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible; and it
would be super uous to say of what Place, be∣cause all the Scythians were
Vaga∣bonds, and that in a little time they were found Two and Three Hundred
Leagues distance from the Country, which they inhabited a little before.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<P>The First time then that there is mention made of them, is in
the Year 256, under the Empire of <HI>Gallus</HI> and <HI>Vo∣lusian,</HI>
when they passed the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine</HI> near <HI>Mentz;</HI> and when <HI>Aurelian</HI> who was
yet but Tribune of a Legion, killed Seven Hundred of them in an Encoun∣ter, and
made Three Hundred Pri∣soners, who were sold at the publick Sale.</P>
<P>From this first Irruption, to the time when they conquered or
besought of the Romans the Possession of some Lands in
<HI>Gaul,</HI> to wit, in the Countries of <HI>Cologne, Leige,</HI> and the
Neighbouring parts, there passed near 180 Years, which was in the Year 416.
There was lodged a Party in <HI>Brabant</HI> in the time of <HI>Julian</HI> the
Apostate, towards the Year 358; but it is not known, whe∣ther they were
permitted to establish themselves there.</P>
<P>During these Two Ages they conti∣nued their Incursions with
divers Suc∣cesses, always retiring with their Booty into <HI>Germany.</HI>
They possessed there the most part of those Lands which are
be∣tween the <HI>Mein</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Weser</HI> and the
Ocean; sometimes more, some∣times less extended, according as they 
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>were weak or powerful, and as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were pressed by other Nations, par∣ticularly
by the Germans towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Mein,</HI> and the Saxons towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea.</P>
<P>These last proceeding from a Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣try, which we now call <HI>Holstein,</HI>
seise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon
<HI>Friesland,</HI> and the Marine part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on this side the River <HI>Elbe;</HI> then
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the French
established themselves i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Gaul,</HI> they succeeded in the possession of the
greatest part of those which they had enjoyed beyond the
<HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>The French Nation was divided into several People,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">West-Friesland.</NOTE> Great and<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">North-Holland.</NOTE> Little <HI>Frisons,</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Zeland.</NOTE> <HI>Salians,</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Bishop∣rick of <HI>Munster.</HI></NOTE>

divers others in its Alliance, and others also under its Dominion.</P>
<P>Oftentimes the Romans went to as∣sault them in their Woods and
Marshes, and thought to extirpate them Two or Three times, particularly
<HI>Constantine</HI> the Great; but they repulsed them al∣ways.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<P>They had several Captains or Com∣manders, Kings, Princes, Dukes
or Ge∣nerals, who had no absolute Authority but in War.</P>
<P>Sometimes they served as Stipenda∣ries to the Romans,
sometimes became their Subjects; but as soon as the time was changed, and
that they found an occasion to pillage, they supposed them∣selves no
longer obliged to entertain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Treaties; for which Reason the Au∣thors of those times accuse them of
In∣constancy, Lying, and Perfidiousness: So that we at this time need not
give our selves the trouble of admiring at their Treacherous Practices and
un∣manly Attempts, since they have them from their first Original, and
since they seem to be carried on thereto as it were by Natural Instinct,
deriving their Un∣worthy Qualities from their Predeces∣sors.</P>
<P>The last Day of the Year 406, the Alains and Vandals seducing
along with them the Bourguignons, the Sueves, and several other Barbarous
People, passed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and made an irruption into
<HI>Gaul,</HI> which was the most furious and severe that had been yet
seen.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<P>These Barbarians having ransacked all the First
<HI>Germany,</HI> and the Second <HI>Belgick,</HI> transferr'd themselves
into <HI>A∣quitain:</HI> In the Year 409, some Bands of Vandals and Sueves,
passed from thence into <HI>Spain.</HI> Two Years after, the others being
consternated at the March of <HI>Ataulfe</HI> King of the Visigoths, who
came from <HI>Haly,</HI> took the same Road, and followed them. There
re∣mained notwithstanding some of the Alains in <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and upon
the Banks of the <HI>Loire,</HI> who enjoyed a Succession of Kings for
above Sixty Years toge∣ther, but in the end they underwent the Dominion of the
Visigoths and Bourguignons.</P>
<P>The Vandals and Sueves seized upon <HI>la Galice,</HI> the
Silinges <HI>la Betique,</HI> and the Alains part of <HI>Lusit ania,</HI> and
the Pro∣vince of <HI>Carthagene.</HI> Sixteen Years af∣ter, the Vandals
passed into <HI>Africk,</HI> but in the mean time <HI>Vallia</HI> King of
the Visigoths who fought for the Romans, utterly extirpated the Silinges, and
re∣duced the Alains to that extremity, that being unable to subsist any
longer by themselves, they went and submit∣ted to <HI>Gunderic</HI> King of
the Vandals. The Sueves maintained themselves near <PB N="11" REF="11"/>Two
Ages in Spain; and at length their Kingdom was also extinguished by
<HI>Leu∣vilgild</HI> King of the Visigoths in the Year 588.</P>
<P>All these Barbarians were divided in∣to several Bands or
Parties, who had each their Captain, and made Incur∣sions and Ravages without
intermission. So far they proceeded, that there was seen at the same
time People of the same Nation in Places far remote one from the other, and
in Interests direct∣ly opposite.</P>
<P>In the Year 408 <HI>Stilicon, Honorius</HI>'s Lieutenant, who was
accused for intro∣ducing them, is massacred by the Or∣der of
<HI>Honorius</HI> the Emperor. <HI>Alaric</HI> King of the Visigoths his good
Friend, to revenge his Death, besieged the City of <HI>Rome</HI> Three times,
and the last takes it by Treason, on the Twentieth Day of
<HI>August,</HI> in the Year 410. About the end of the same Year, he died
in <HI>Cala∣bria,</HI> as he was preparing to pass into <HI>Africk.
Ataulfe</HI> his Cousin succeeded him, and espoused <HI>Placidia</HI>
Sister of the Emperor <HI>Honorius,</HI> whom he had taken in
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 412, <HI>Ataulfe</HI> passed into <HI>Gaul
Narbonnoise,</HI> and makes himself <PB N="12" REF="12"/>Master of
<HI>Narbonne.</HI> He remained there but Three Years. The Count
<HI>Constantius</HI> who was since Emperor, and married <HI>Placidia</HI>
his Widow, compel∣led him to go into <HI>Spain,</HI> where he was killed by his
own People in <HI>Barcelone,</HI> towards the Month of <HI>September,</HI> in
the Year 415. They elected <HI>Sigerick</HI> in his Place, and gave him the
same entertainment on the Seventh Day. <HI>Vallia</HI> his Successor was
remanded into <HI>Gaul</HI> by <HI>Constantius,</HI> who gave him the Second
<HI>Aquitain,</HI> with some Cities in the adjacent Provinces; amongst
others, that of <HI>Toulouze,</HI> where he established his Royal Seat in
the Year 419. But he died in few Months after, and <HI>Theo∣dorick</HI>
succeeded him. Under this King, and under <HI>Evaric</HI> or <HI>Eurick,</HI>

<P>During the great Revolt of the Ma∣ritime People, to wit, those

free possession of it: A little after which, <HI>Faramond</HI> began to
reign. We find in the Histo∣rians of those times, that the French had
enjoyed several Kings before him, as <HI>Genebaud</HI> and <HI>Alec,</HI> in
the Year 288, who came to <HI>Treves,</HI> to sue for a Peace of
<HI>Maximilian;</HI> As also <HI>Ascaric</HI> and <HI>Radagaise,</HI> in
the Year 307, whom <HI>Constan∣tine</HI> took Prisoners in War, and
expo∣sed them to Wild Beasts in the <HI>Arena,</HI> for having taken up
Arms, notwith∣standing their Faith given to <HI>Constantius</HI> his

French Gen∣tleman was one Day speaking ad∣vantagiously of the Free, Genteel
Hu∣mour of his Countrymen to an Italian, and said, that there was no Nation
could deny, but that the French were the most tractable and sincere People
in the World; to which the Italian an∣swered, that the thing from which he
pretended to draw all his Advantages, passed with them for a weakness,
and an effect of their imprudence. I don't admire, replied the French-man
coldly, that you make so disadvantagious a Judgment of our best
Qualities, because your Politicks believe, that without be∣ing a Cunning
Knave, one can never make a Gallant Man.</P>
<P>As to the Persons of this People, they are commonly of a Middle

so much exclaimed against by their ri∣gid Ministers, it is thought that
many more of the French Catholicks had been of the Reformed Religion. For so
ex∣treamly are they bent upon this Di∣version, that no interruption
whatsoe∣ver, neither Age, Sickness, nor even Po∣verty shall retain their
Heels when they hear the Musick.</P>
<P>Their Language is very smooth and pleasant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> but rather Elegant than Co∣pious, and therefore
much troubled for want of Words to find out Periphrases; besides, that a
great deal of it is expres∣sed in the Action; the head and Shoulders move
as significantly towards it, as the Lips and Tongue; and he that pretends to
speak it with a good grace, must have somewhat in him of the Buffoon. It
is enriched with variety of Proverbs, which is a great help to the French
