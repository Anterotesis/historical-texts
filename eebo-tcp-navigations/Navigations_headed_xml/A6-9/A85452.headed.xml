<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen <HI>England</HI> began to decline in Religion, like luke-warme <HI>Laodicea,</HI> and instead of purging out Popery, a farther compliance was sought not onely in vaine Idolatrous Ceremonies, but also in prophaning the Sabbath, and by Proclamation throughout their Parish churches, exasperating lewd and prophane persons to celebrate a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b∣bath like the Heathen to <HI>Venus, Baccus</HI> and <HI>Ceres;</HI> in so much that the multitude of irreligious lascivious and pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh affected per∣sons spred the whole land like <HI>Grashoppers,</HI> in this very time Christ the glorious King of his Churches, raises an Army out of our <HI>English</HI> Nation, for freeing his people from their long servitude under usurp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Prelacy; and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause every corner of <HI>England</HI> was filled with the fury of malignant adversaries, Christ creates a New <HI>England</HI> to muster up the first of his Forces in; Whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> condition, little number, and remotenesse of place made

these adversaries triumph, despising this day of small things, but in this hight of their pride the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> brought sudden, and unexpected destruction upon them. Thus have you a touch of the time when this worke began.</P>
<P><HI>Christ Jesus</HI> intending to manifest his Kingly Office toward his Churches more fully then ever yet the Sons of men saw, even to the uniting of <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches in one Faith, begins with our <HI>English</HI> Nation (whose former Reformation being vere imperfect) doth now resolve to cast down their false foun∣dation of Prelacy, even in the hight of their domineering dig∣nity. And therefore in the yeare 1628. he stirres up his servants as the Heralds of a King to make this Proclamation for Volun∣tiers as followeth.</P>
<P>Oh yes! oh yes! oh yes! <HI>All you the people of Christ that are here Oppressed, Imprisoned and scurrilously derided, gather your selves together, your Wifes and little ones, and answer to your seve∣rall Names as you shall be shipped for his service, in the Westere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World, and more especially for planting the united Collonies of new</HI> England; <HI>Where you are to attend the service of the King of Kings, upon the divulging of this Proclamation by his Herralds at Armes.</HI> Many (although otherwise willing for this service) began to object as followeth:</P>
<P>Can it possible be the mind of Christ, (who formerly inabled so many Souldiers of his to keepe their station unto the death here) that now so many brave Souldiers disciplined by Christ him∣selfe the Captaine of our salvation, should turne their backs to the disheartning of their Fellow-Souldiers, and losse of further opportunity in gaining a greater number of Subjects to Christs Kingdome?</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Objection, It was further proclaimed as followeth: What Creature, wilt not know that Christ thy King crusheth with a rod of Iron, the Pompe and Price of man, and must he like man cast and contrive to take his enemies at advan∣tage? No, of purpose hee causeth such instruments to retreate as he hath made strong for himselfe: that so his adversaries glory∣ing in the pride of their power, insulting over the little remnan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remaining, Christ causeth them to be cast downe suddenly for∣ever, and wee find in stories reported, Earths Princes have passio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Yea, such will be the phantasticall madnesse of some (if you take not heed) that silly Women laden with diverse lusts, will be had in higher esteeme with them, then those honoured of Christ, indued with power and authority from him to Preach; Abuse not the free and full liberty Christ hath given you in making choyce of your own Officers, and consent in admitting into his Churches, and casting out such Members as walke disorderly; you are to walke in all humility, lest in injoyment of such freedoms as you for∣merly have not exercised, you exceede the bounds of modesty, and instead of having your moderation knowne to all, your im∣becility, and selfe-exaltation bee discovered by many, in admis∣sion of others into Church society.

Then let none wrest it from you under pretence of liberty of Conscience, men of per∣verse judgements will draw Disciples after them, but let your consciences be pure, and Christs Churches free from all Doctrines that deceive. And all you, who are or shall be shipped for this worke, thinke it not enough that you injoy the truth, but you must hate every false way and know you are called to be faith∣full Souldiers of Christ, not onely to assist in building up his Churches, but also in pulling downe the Kingdome of <HI>Anti-Christ,</HI> then sure you are not set up for tollerating times, nor shall any of you be content with this that you are set at liberty, but take up your Armes, and march manfully on till all opposers of Christs Kingly power be abolished: and as for you who are called to sound forth his silver Trumpets, blow lowd and shrill, to this chiefest treble tune; For the Armies of the great <HI>Jehovah</HI> are at hand.

<P>Feare not the misse of men to fill your Townes, and compleat your companies; for although at first struglings for truths ad∣vance there may but a small number appeare of sound judge∣ment: yet shall you not prefer any to Office, whose zeale is not strong for the truth, for now the minde of <HI>Christ</HI> is to put out the Name of <HI>Ammaleck</HI> from under Heaven (I meane such at have persecuted the Churches and People of <HI>Christ</HI> in their low condition) and assuredly unsound <HI>Saules</HI> will spare such as should not be saved from destruction. Then be strong and of a good courage (all you that are to fight the Lords Battaile) that your Faith faile not at sight of the great Armies of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog:</HI> and as for you, who shall be preferred to highest places in his New <HI>England</HI> Regiments, cause your Captaine and other infe∣rior Officers to be diligent in their severall places, that you may lend helpe to your Countreymen, that ere long be will see a ne∣cessity of contending for the truth, as well as your selves in choyce of Military Officers; Let faithfulnesse to the cause in hand, courage, activity and skill have the prehemency of honours; for although it may seeme a meane thing to be a New <HI>England</HI> Souldier, yet some of you shall have the battering and bearing

As the worthy incouragement of a Souldiers labour, let Militay dis∣cipline be had in high esteeme among you. Gentlemen, Corpo∣ralls and fellow-Souldiers, keepe your weapons in a continuall readinesse, seeing you are called to fight the Battails of your <HI>Lord Christ;</HI> who must raigne till hee hath put all his enemies un∣der his Feet, his glorious Victories over <HI>Antichrist</HI> are at hand, never yet did any Souldier rejoyce in dividing the spoyle after Victory, as all the Souldiers of <HI>Christ</HI> shall, to see his judgement executed upon the great Whore, and withall the Lambs bride prepared for him, who comes Skipping over &amp; trampling down the great Mountaines of the Earth, whose universall Govern∣ment will then appeare glorious, when not onely the <HI>Assyrian, Babilonian, Persian, Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Monarchies shall sub∣ject themselves unto him, but also all other new upstart King∣domes, Dukedomes, or what else can be named, shall fall before him; Not that he shall come personally to Reigne upon Earth (as some vainly imagine) but his powerfull Presence and Glo∣rious brightnesse of his Gospell both to <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> shall not onely spiritually cause the Churches of <HI>Christ</HI> to grow beyond number, but also the whole civill Government of people upon Earth shall become his, so that there shall not be any to move the hand, not dog his tongue against his chosen, <HI>And then shall the time be of breaking Speares into Mattocks, and Swords into Sithes;</HI> and this to remaine to his last comming, which will be personally to overcome the last enemies of his Saints, even death, which hee will doe by the word of his Mouth, audibly spoken the World throughout.</P>
<P>Then all you, who are now, or shall hereafter be shipped for this Voyage, minde the worke of Christ, and not some follow∣ing raigne, titles of honour, others eying the best Grasse-platts and best Situation for Farmes and large Accommodations, crouding our Gods people from sitting down among you.

whereas Rams Hornes could overthrow the high and strong walles of <HI>Jericho,</HI> before his theft committed, after it the little number of the men of <HI>Ai</HI> could put the Host of the living God to flight, see then you stand upon your watch continually in the strength of <HI>Christ,</HI> for assuredly instead of casting downe the enemies of <HI>Christ,</HI> thissin will cast down you utterly, disinable you for striking one stroke in the cause of <HI>Christ;</HI> and whereas he hath purposely pickt ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this People for a patterne of purity and soundnesse of Doctrine, as well as Discipline, that all such may finde a refuge among you, and let not any Merchants, In∣keepers, Taverners and men of Trade in hope of gaine, fling open the gates so wide, as that by letting in all sorts you mar the worke of <HI>Christ</HI> intended: neither shall such labourers as hee hath pickt out to be Pyoneers in this Campe of his, drinke up like Spunges such meanes as hee hath sent to maintaine both Officers, and private Souldiers. Lastly, let not such as fight, set foote on Land to compose Townes for Habitations, take up large accommodations for sale, to inrich themselves with others goods, who are to follow them, but freely as you have received, so give out to others: for so soone as you shall seeke to ingrosse the Lords wast into your hands, he will ease you of your burden by making stay of any farther resort unto you, and then be sure you shall have wast Land enough.</P>
<P>To this Commission was added a strong motive to this work as followeth: Namely, the great enmity betweene that on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truth as it is in <HI>Jesus,</HI> and all other unsound and undeceiveable Doctrines, together with the persons that hold them; insomuch, that they cannot stand in one Common-wealth long together, as sixteene hundred yeares experience will testifie, the which <HI>Moses</HI> layes down as one maine reason, why he might not admit of a toleration to worship God in <HI>Egypt.</HI> And therefore all you that believe the Scripture, which so plainly prophecy the destruction of Antichrist and all Antichristian Doctrines; Pray, pray, pray, pray continually with that valiant worthy <HI>Joshua</HI> that the Sun may stand still in <HI>Gibeon,</HI> and the Moone in the vally of <HI>Aijalon,</HI> for assuredly although some small battailes may be fought against the enemies of <HI>Christ,</HI> yet the great day of their finall overthrow shall not come till the bright Sonne of that one cleare

not breake, being so thin, for attaining those Vessells they brought them much Bever, fraughting them richly away according to their desires, this was the first working providence of <HI>Christ</HI> to stir up our <HI>English</HI> Nation, to plant these parts in hope of a rich Trade for Bever-skins, and this made some of our Countrymen make their abode in these parts, whom this Army of <HI>Christ</HI> at their comming over found as fit helps to further their designe in planting the Churches of <HI>Christ;</HI> Who by a more admirable act of his Providence not long after prepared for his peoples arrivall as followeth.</P>
<P>The Summer after the blazing Starre (whose motion in the Heavens was from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> poynting out to the sons of men the progresse of the glorious Gospell of <HI>Christ,</HI> the glorious King of his Churches) even about the yeare 1618. a little before the removeall of that Church of <HI>Christ</HI> from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>Plimoth</HI> in New <HI>England,</HI> as the ancient <HI>Indians</HI> report, there befell a great mortality among them, the greatest that ever the memory of Fa∣ther to Sonne tooke notice of, chiefly desolating those places, where the <HI>English</HI> afterward planted the Country of <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kanoky, Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssawamg,</HI> it was almost wholy deserted, insomuch that the Neighbour <HI>Indians</HI> did abandon those places for feare of death, fleeing more West &amp; by South, observing the East and by Northern parts were most smitten with this contagion, the <HI>Abarginny▪</HI> men consisting of <HI>Mattachusets, Wippanaps</HI> and <HI>Tarratines</HI> were great∣ly weakned, and more especially the three Kingdomes, or <HI>Sag∣gamore</HI> ships of the <HI>Mattachusets,</HI> who were before this mor∣tality most populous, having under them seven Dukedomes or petty <HI>Saggamores,</HI> and the <HI>Nianticks</HI> and <HI>Narrowganssits,</HI> who before this came were but of little note, yet were they now not much increased by such as fled thither for feare of death, the <HI>Pecods</HI> (who retained the Name of a war-like people, till af∣terwards conquered by the <HI>English)</HI> were also smitten at this time.

But by this meanes <HI>Christ</HI> (whose great and glorious workes the Earth throughout are al∣together for the benefit of his Churches and chosen) not onely made roome for his people to plant; but also tamed the hard and cruell hearts of these barbarous <HI>Indians,</HI> insomuch that halfe a handfull of his people landing not long after in <HI>Plimoth-</HI>Plantation, found little resistance, of whom the Author purposes not to speake particularly, being prevented by the honoured Mr. <HI>Winslow,</HI> who was an eye-witnesse of the worke: onely thus much by the way, they were sent to keepe possession for their Brethren and fellow Souldiers, who arrived eight yeares after them, as in processe of this story will God-willing appeare: and verily herein they quit themselves like men, or rather <HI>Christ</HI> for and by them, maintaining the place notwithstanding the multi∣tude of difficulties they met withall at their first landing, being in doubtfull suspence what intertainment these Barbarians would give them, having with prayer supplicated the Lord in the Name of Christ their King and guide in this their undertaking, they manned out a Boate to discover what store of the Inhabitants were there. Now these men, whose courage exceeded the num∣ber, being guided by the provident hand of the most high, landed in some severall places; and by making fires gave signes of their approach, now the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose dwellings are most neer the water side, appeared with their Bowes bent and Arrowes one the string, let fly their long shifts among this little company, whom they might soon have inclosed, but the Lord otherwise disposed of it, for one Captaine <HI>Miles Standish</HI> having his fowl∣ing-peece in a reddinesse, presented full at them, his shot being directed by the provident Hand of the most high God, strook the stourest <HI>Sachem</HI> among them one the right Arme, it being bent over his shoulder to reach an Arrow forth his Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver, as their manner is to draw them forth in fight, at this stroke they

all fled with great swiftnesse through the Woods and Thickets, then the <HI>English,</HI> who more thirsted after their conversion than destruction, returned to their Bote without receiving any dam∣age, and soon after arrived where they left their Brethren, to whom they declared the good hand of God toward them, with thankfull acknowledgement of this great worke of his in pre∣serving them; Yet did they all remaine full of incumbred thoughts, the <HI>Indians,</HI> of whose multitudes they had now some intelligence, together with experience of spirits, and also knew well without commerce with them they were not like long to subsist.</P>
<P>But hee, whose worke they went about, wrought so rare a Providence for them, which cannot but be admired of all that heare it. Thus it befell as they were discoursing in the Bote they had built for shelter, all of a sudden an <HI>Indian</HI> came in among them, at whose speech they were all agast, he speaking in the <HI>English</HI> Language, <HI>Much welcome Englishmen,</HI> their wonder was the greater, because upon those Costes they supposed no <HI>English</HI> had so much as set foote, and verily Christ had prepared him on purpose to give his people intertainment, the <HI>Indian</HI> having li∣ved in <HI>England</HI> two year or thereabout, after which he returned home, and at this time had wandred into those parts in compa∣ny of other <HI>Indians,</HI> all this, and the condition of the neere adjoy∣ning <HI>Indians,</HI> hee soon discovered unto them, at which they were transported beyond themselves very much, what with joy and the mixture of their former feare and affection intervening with the other, surprised all their senses of a sudden, that long it was ere each party could take its proper place, yea, and beyond all this <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> by the power of his blessed Spirit, did now work upon all their faculties both of Soule and Body, the great im∣pression of his present Providence might not soon be washed off with the following incumbred cares of a Defart Wildernesse; but to contract, they made use of the present opprotunity, and by the instrumentall meanes of this <HI>Indian,</HI> became acquainted and reconciled with most of the Neighbouring <HI>Indians.</HI> And af∣terward planted a Church of Christ there, and set up civill Go∣vernment, calling the Name of the place <HI>Plimoth:</HI> under this jurisdiction there are ten Churches at this very day, this being the

Saints, by calling appearing so in the judgement of Charity, being tryed by the rule of the word, not scandalous in their Lives, for the society of such they sought, and in these beginnings found ve∣ry few, seven being the lest number a Church can be gathered, or conceived by just consequence from the Word of God. Having fasted and prayed with humble acknowledgement of their own unworthinesse to be called of Christ to so worthy a worke, they joyned together in a holy Covenant with the Lord, and one with another promising by the Lords Assistance to walke toge∣ther in Exhorting, Admonishing, and Rebuking one another, and to cleave to the Lord with a full purpose of heart, accord∣ing to the blessed Rules of his Word made known unto them, and further they seeing by light of Scripture the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> a∣scended up on high to give gifts unto men, not onely extraordi∣nary as Apostles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before the Canon of the Scripture was perfected but also ordinary as Pastors and Teachers, and that such are to be fitted with gifts according, for so mighty a worke, as is the Feeding and Ruling the Flock of Christ. Wherefore they Elected and Ordained one Mr. <HI>Higgingson</HI> to be Tracher of this first Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> set up in those parts, a man indued with grace apt to teach, and mighty in the Scriptures, Learned in the Tongues, able to convince gain-sayers, aptly applying the word to his hearers, who departed this life not long after, of whom it may be said.</P>

Have you not here your Tables filled with great variety of Foode, your Coffers filled with Coyne, your Houses beautifully built and filled with all rich Furniture? (or otherwise) have you not such a gainfull Trade as none the like in the Towne where you live? Are you not inriched daily? Are not your Children very well provided for as they come to years? (nay) may you not here as pithily practise the two chiefe Du∣ties of a Christian (if Christ give strength) namely Mortificati∣on and Sanct fication as in any place of the World? What helps can you have there that you must not carry from hence? With bold resolvednesse these stout Souldiers of Christ reply; as Death, the King of terror with all his dreadfull attendance inhu∣mane and barbarous, tortures doubled and trebled by all the in∣fernall furies have appeared but light and momentany to the Souldiers of <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> so also the Pleasure, Profits and Ho∣nours of this World set forth in their most glorious splend or, and magnitude by the alluring Lady of Delight, proffering pleasant embraces, cannot intice with her <HI>Syren</HI> Songs, such Souldiers of Christ, whose aymes are elevated by him, many Millions above that brave Warrier <HI>Vlysses.</HI></P>
<P>Now seeing all can be said will but barely set forth the im∣moveable Resolutions that Christ continued in these men; Passe on and attend with teares, if thou hast any, the following dis∣course, while these Men, Women and Children are taking their last farwell of their Native Country, Kindred, Friends and Ac∣quaintance, while the Ships attend them; Many make choise of some solitary place to eccho out their bowell-breaking affections in bidding their Friends farwell, deare friends (sayes one) as neare as my owne soule doth thy love lodge in my brest, with

Ah! my much ho∣noured friend, hath Christ given thee so great a charge as to be Leader of his People into that far remote, and vast Wildernesse, I, oh, and alas thou must die there and never shall I see thy Face in the flesh againe, wert thou called to so great a taske as to passe the pretious Ocean, and hazard thy person in Battell against thousands of Malignant Enemies there? there were hopes of thy return with triumph, but now after two three, or foure moneths spent with daily expectation of swallowing Waves, and cruell Pirates, you are to be Landed among barbarous <HI>Indians,</HI> famous for nothing but cruelty, where you are like to spend your days in a famishing condition for a long space; Scarce had he utter∣ed this, but presently hee lockes his friend fast in his armes, hold∣ing each other thus for some space of time, they weepe againe, But as <HI>Paul</HI> to his beloved flock: the other replies what doe you weeping and breaking my heart?

<P>Then my deare friend unfold thy hands, for thou and I have much worke to doe, I and all Christian Souldiers the World throughout▪ then hand in hand they leade each other to the San∣dy-banks of the brinish Ocean, when clenching their hands fast, they unloose not til inforced to wipe their watery-eyes, whose constant streames forced a watery-path upon their Cheekes, which to hide from the eyes of others they shun society for a time, but being called by occasion, whose bauld back-part none

here it lies in banke, put out to the greatest advantage that ever any hath beene for many hundred of yeares before, and verily although in casting it up some hundreds may be miscounted (for the Author would not willingly exceede in any respect) but to be sure Christ stands by and beholds every mite that (in the obedience of Faith) is cast into this Treasury: but what doe wee answering men? the money is all Christs, and certainly hee will take it well that (his) have so disposed of it to his advantage; by this meanes hee hath had a great income in <HI>England</HI> of late, Prayers, Teares and Praise, and some Reformation; <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> have met with much of the profit of this Banke, <HI>Virginia, Bermodas</HI> and <HI>Barbados</HI> have had a taste, and <HI>France</HI> may suddenly meete with the like.

At whose courage many of the Seamen wonder, not knowing under whose command these their passen∣gers were, even he who makes all his Souldiers bold as Lions, Yet was he not minded to make triall of his peoples valiantey in fight at this time, for the ships comming up with them proved to be their own Countrymen and friends, at which they greatly rejoyced, seeing the good hand of their God was upon them, and are further strengthened in Faith to rely one Christ, for the future time against all Leakes, Stormes, Rockes, Sands, and all other wants a long Sea-voyage procures, sustaining them with a I meeknesse and patience, yet sensible of the Lords frownes, humbling their soules before him, and also rejoyeing in his de∣liverauces in taking the cup of Salvation, and paying the tribute of thankfulnesse to the most high, whose provident hand was diversly directed toward them, purposely to point out the great hardships they must undergoe in this their Christian warfare, and withall to tell them, although their difficulties were many and moumfull, yet their victories shou'd be much more glorious and joyfull, eminently eyed of the whole World, but now keeping their course so neere as the winds will suffer them, the billowes begin to grow lofty and rageing, and suddenly bringing them into the vale of death, covering them with the formidable flouds, and dashing their bodies from side to side, hurling their unfixed goods from place to place at these unwonted workes.

for present, and now is the time if ever of recounting this service they have, and are about to undertake for Christ; but he, who is very sensible of his peoples infirmities, rebukes the winds, and Seas for their sakes, and then the reverend and godly among them begin to exhort them in the name of the Lord, and from the Lord, being fitted with such words as much incourrages the worke they are going about, many of their horses and other Cattell are cast over-board by the way, to the great disheartning of some, but Christ knew well how for his peoples hearts would be taken off the maine worke with these things. And therefore although he be very tender in providing outward necessaries for his, yet rather than this great worke (he intends) should be hin∣dered, their Tables shall be spred but thinly in this wildernesse for a time. After the Lord had exercised them thus severall ways, he sent Diseases to visit their Ships, that the desart Land they were now drawing near unto might not be deserted by them at first enterance, which sure it would have been by many, had not the Lord prevented by a troublesom passage: At forty dayes end, or thereabout, they cast to sound the Seas depth, and find them sixty fadom, by which they deem the bankes of New sound Land are near, where they being provided with Cod-line and Hooke hale up some store of fish to their no small refreshing, and within some space of time after they approach the Cost of <HI>New England,</HI> where they are againe provided with Mackarell, and that which was their greater rejoycing, they discover Land, at sight thereof they blessed the Lord.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. <HI>Of the admirable Acts of Christs Providence, in delivering this his people in their Voyages by Sea, from many foule dangers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOu have heard of about 198. Ships passing the perillous Ocean, of all which I heare of but one that ever miscarried; yet shall you here see some of the great dangers they were in the Ship, this Author came in a foggy morning, anon by breake of day was ready to be steamed by a Pirate, but being unready for sight they passed by; others by a fog, have been delivered from farther chase of them, so that of this great number never did any Pirate make one shot at them, according to best intelligence. Their deliverance from leakes also hath been no lesse wonder∣full, some so neare sinking, that the loving affection betweene Husband and Wife, hath caused them to fould each other in their Armes, with Resolution to die together, and make the Sea

their Grave, yet not ceasing to call on the Lord, their present helpe in time of need, who is minded to manifest his great care for this his people to all that shall come to hear thereof. And therefore directs to meanes for freeing their ships, being now ready to founder in the depthlesse Ocean. And further, as if these deliverances were too little to expresse the tender care <HI>Christ</HI> hath of his, to free them from all dangers, those that occupy their businesse in the deepe, and see the Wonders of God upon the waters, are taken with great astonishment to behold the extra∣ordinary hand of the most High, in transportation of this people, in that their Ships all of a sudden are brought so neer the ground, and yet strike not their Pilots, missing ofttimes of their skill on those unwandered. Coasts, but their <HI>Jehovah</HI> hee misses not to be an exact Pilot in the most thickest foggs and darkest nights, for thus it befell.</P>
<P>The night newly breaking off her darknesse, and the day-light being clouded with a grosse vapor, as if nights Curtaines re∣mained halfe shut, the Sea-men and Passengers standing on the Decks, suddenly fixed their eyes one a great Boat (as they deemed) and anon after they spied another, and after that an∣other; but musing on the matter, they perceived themselves to be in great danger of many great Rocks, with much terror and affrightment, they turned the Ship about, expecting every mo∣ment to be dasht in pieces against the Rocks. But he whose pro∣vidence brought them in, Piloted them out againe, without any danger, to their great Rejoycing. And assuredly) so extraordi∣narily eminent and admirable to the eyes of many beholders, was the wonderfull workes in magnifying the Rich grace toward this his people in prefering them) that many Masters of Ships left their See imployment for a time, and chose rather to suffer the wante of a Wildernesse with the people of God, than to in∣crease their Estates in a full-fed Land, and verily so taken they were, that they fell down at <HI>Christs</HI> Feet, and were placed by him as living stones, Elect and Pretious in his Churches; also many other Seamen were brought to seeke after <HI>Christ</HI> in his Ordinan∣ces, by which it appeares some great worke, by some far surpas∣sing all this, hath <HI>Christ</HI> ere long to doe, that hee thus fitteth In∣struments. Then all you that occupy shipping prepare for his

service, who will assuredly prove the best owner that ever you went to Sea for.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the condition of those persons passed the Seas, in this long and restlesse Voyage (if rightly considered) will more magnifie the grace of <HI>Christ</HI> in this great Worke. First, such were many of them that never before had made any path through the Waters, no not by boat, neither so much as seene a Ship, others so tenderly brought up that they had little hope of their Lives continuance under such hardships, as so long a Voyage must needs inforce them to indure, others there were, whose Age did rather call for a quiet Couch to rest them on, than a pinching Cabbin in a Reeling Ship, others whose weake natures were so borne downe with Disease, that they could hard∣ly craule up the Ships-side, yet ventured their weake Vessells to this <HI>Westurne</HI> World.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>Of the first leading of these People of Christ, when the Civill Government was Established.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUt to goe on with the Story, the 12 of <HI>July</HI> or thereabout 1630. these Souldiers of <HI>Christ</HI> first set foote one this <HI>Westerne</HI> end of the World; where arriveing in safety, both Men, Women and Children. On the North side of <HI>Charles</HI> River, they landed neare a small Island, called <HI>Noddells</HI> Island, where one Mr. <HI>Samuel Mavereck</HI> then living, a man of a very loving and curteous behaviour, very ready to entertaine strangers, yet an enemy to the Reformation in hand, being strong for the Lordly Prelaticall power one this Island, he had built a small Fort with the helpe of one Mr. <HI>David Tompson,</HI> placing there∣in foure Murtherers to protect him from the <HI>Indians.</HI> About one mile distant upon the River ran a small creeke, taking its Name from Major Gen. <HI>Edward Gibbons,</HI> who dwelt there for some yeares after; One the South side of the River one a point of Land called <HI>Blaxtons</HI> point, planted Mr. <HI>William Blaxton,</HI> of whom we have formerly spoken: to the South East of him, neare an Island called <HI>Tompsons</HI> Island lived some few Planters more, these persons were the first Planters of those parts, having some small Trading with the <HI>Indians</HI> for <HI>Beaver-</HI>Skins, which moved them to make their aboade in those parts, whom these first Troopes of <HI>Christs</HI> Army, found as fit helpes to further their worke. At their arrivall those small number of Christians ga∣thered at <HI>Salem,</HI> greatly rejoycing and the more, because they saw so many that came chiefly for promoting the great Work of <HI>Christ</HI> in hand, the Lady <HI>Arrabella</HI> and some other godly Women aboad at <HI>Salem,</HI> but their Husbands continued at <HI>Charles</HI> Town, both for the settling the civill Government, and gathering another Church of <HI>Christ.</HI> The first Court was holden aboard the <HI>Arrabella</HI> the 23. of <HI>August.</HI> When the much honoured <HI>John Wintrope</HI> Esq. was chosen Governour for the remainder of that yeare, 1630. Also the worthy <HI>Thomus Dudly</HI> Esq. was chosen Deputy Governour, and Mr. <HI>Simon Brodestreet</HI> Secretary, the people after their long Voyage were many of them troubled
<PB N="38" REF="22"/>
with the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> and some of them died: the first station they tooke up was at <HI>Charles</HI> Towne, where they pitched some Tents of Cloath, other built them small Huts, in which they lodged their Wifes and Children. The first beginning of this worke seemed very dolorous; First for the death of that worthy per∣sonage <HI>Izaac Johnson</HI> Esq. whom the Lord had indued with ma∣ny pretious gifts, insomuch that he was had in high esteeme among all the people of God, and as a chiefe Pillar to support this new erected building, He very much rejoyced at his death, that the Lord had been pleased to keepe his eyes open so long, as to see one Church of <HI>Christ</HI> gathered before his death, at whose depar∣ture there was not onely many weeping eyes, but some fainting hearts, fearing the fall of the present worke. For future Remem∣brance of him mind this <HI>Meeter.</HI></P>

<P>The griefe of this people was further increased by the sore sicknesse which befell among them, so that almost in every Fa∣mily Lamentation, Mourning, and woe was heard, and no fresh food to be had to cherish them, it would assuredly have moved the most lockt up affections to Teares no doubt, had they past from one Hut to another, and beheld the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teous case these people were in, and that which added to their present distresse was the want of fresh water, for although the place did afford

plenty, yet for present they could finde but one Spring, and that not to be come at, but when the tide was downe, which caused many to passe over to the South-side of the River, where they afterward erected some other Townes, yet most admirable it was to see with what Christian courage many of these Souldiers of <HI>Christ</HI> carried it amidst all these calamities, and in <HI>October,</HI> the Governour Deputy and Assistants, held their second Court on the South-side of the River; Where they then began to build, holding correspondency with <HI>Charles</HI> Towne, as one and the same.</P>

<P>The much honoured <HI>Thomas Dudly</HI> Esquire was chosen Deputy Governour, and the number of Free-men added was about 83. Those honoured persons who were now in place of Government, having the propagation of the Churches of <HI>Christ,</HI> in their eye laboured by all meanes to make roome for Inhabitants, know∣ing well that where the dead carkass is, thither will the Eagles resort. But herein they were much opposed by certaine persons, whose greedy desire for land much hindered the worke for a time, as indeed all such persons do at this very day, and let such take notice how these were cured of this distemper, some were taken away by death, and then to be sure they had Land enough, others fearing poverty, and famishment, supposing the present scarcity would never be turned into plenty, removed them∣selves away, and so never beheld the great good the Lord hath

Quoth one, my Husband hath tra∣vailed as far as <HI>Plimoth</HI> (which is neere 40 miles,) and hath with great toile brought a little Corne home with him, and before that is spent the Lord will assuredly provide: quoth the other, our last peck of Meaie it now in the Oven at home a baking, and ma∣ny of our godly Neighbours have quite spent all, and wee owe one Loafe of that little wee have; Then spake a third, my husband hath veatured himselfe among the <HI>Indians</HI> for Corne, and can get none, as also our honoured Governour hath distributed his so far, that a day or two more will put an end to his store, and all the rest, and yet methinks our Children are as cheerefull, fat, and lusty with feeding upon those Mussells, Clambanks and other Fish as they were in <HI>England,</HI> with their fill of Bread, which makes mee cheerfull in the Lords providing for us, being further confirmed by the exhoreation of our Pastor to trust the Lord with providing for us; whose is the Earth and the fulnesse there∣of. And as they were incouraging one another in <HI>Christs</HI> carefull providing for them, they lift up their eyes and saw two Ships comming in, and presently this newes came to their Eares, that they were come from <HI>Jacland</HI> full of Victualls, now their poore heares were not so much refreshed in regard of the food they saw they were like to have, as their soules rejoyced in that <HI>Christ</HI> would now manifest himselfe to be the Commissary Ge∣nerall of this his Army, and that hee should honour them so far as to be poore Sutlers for his Camp, they soone up with their Mussells, and hie them home to stay their hungry stomacks.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. <HI>Of the Lords gracious protection of his people, from the barbarous cruelties of the Heathen.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ABout this time the <HI>Indians</HI> that were most conversant s∣mong them, came quaking and complaining of a barbarous and cruell people called the <HI>Tarratines,</HI> who they said would eat such Men as they caught alive, tying them to a Tree, and gnaw∣ing their flesh by peece-meales off their Bones, as also that they were a strong and numerous people, and now comming, which made them flee to the <HI>English,</HI> who were but very few in num∣ber at this time, and could make but little resistance, being much dispersed, yet did they keepe a constant watch, neglecting no meanes <HI>Christ</HI> had put into their hands for their owne safety, in so much that they were exceedingly weaked with continued la∣bour, watching and hard diet, but the Lord graciously upheld them in all, for thus it befell neere the Towne of <HI>Linn,</HI> then cal∣led <HI>Saugust,</HI> in the very dead of the night (being upon their watch, because of the report that went of the <HI>Indians</HI> approach to those parts) one Lieurenant <HI>Walker,</HI> a man indued with faith, and of a couragious spirit, comming to relieve the Centinell be∣ing come up with him, all of a sudden they heard the Sticks crack hard by them, &amp; with all he felt something b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ush hard upon his shoulder, which was an <HI>Indian</HI> arrow shot through his Coat, and the wing of his buffe-Jacket. Upon this hee discharged his Culliver directly toward the place, where they heard the noise, which being deep'y loden brake in pieces, then they returned to the Court of Guard, and raised such small forces as they had; comming to the light they perceived he had an other Arrow shot through his Coat betwixt his Legs. Seeing this great pre∣sertation they stood upon their Guard till Morning, expecting the <HI>Indians</HI> to come upon them every moment, but when day∣light appeared, they soone sent word to other parts, who ga∣thered together, and tooke counsell how to quit themselves of
<PB N="51" REF="28"/>
these <HI>Indians,</HI> whose approach they demed would be sudden, they ugreed to discharge their great Guns, the redoubling eccho rattling in the Rocks caused the <HI>Indians</HI> to betake themselves to slight (being a terrible unwonted sound unto them) or rather he who put such trembling feare in the <HI>Assyrians</HI> Army, struck the like in these cruell <HI>Canniballs.</HI> In the <HI>Autumne</HI> following, the <HI>Indians,</HI> who had all this time held good correspondency with the <HI>English,</HI> began to quarrell with them about their bounds of Land, notwithstanding they purchased all they had of them, but the Lord put an end to this quarrell also, by smiting the <HI>Indians</HI> with a sore D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sease, even the smll Pox; of the which great numbers of them died, yet these servants of <HI>Christ</HI> minding their Masters businesse, were much moved in affection toward them to see them depart this life without the knowledge of God in Christ. And therefore were very frequent among them for all the noysome∣nesse of their Disease, entring their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> and exhorting them in the Name of the Lord. Among others one of the chiefe <HI>Saggamores</HI> of the <HI>Mattachusets,</HI> whom the <HI>English</HI> named <HI>Saggemore John,</HI> gave some good hopes, being alwayes very cour∣teous to them, whom the godly, and much honour'd among the <HI>English,</HI> visiting a little before his death, they instructing him in the knowledge of God.

<P>Accordingly the honoured Mr. <HI>John Winthrop,</HI> and the Reve∣rend Mr. <HI>John Wilson</HI> tooke them home, notwithstanding the in∣fectiousnesse of the Disease their Father died of. The mortality among them was very great, and increased among them daily more and more, insomuch that the poore Creatures being very timorous of death, would faine have fled from it, but could not tell how, unlesse they could have gone from themselves; Re∣lations were little regarded among them at this time, so that many, who were s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en with the Disease died helplesse, un∣lesse they were neare, and known to the <HI>English:</HI> their <HI>Pow∣wowes,</HI> Wizards, and Charmers, <HI>Athamochas</HI> Factors were possest with greatest feare of any.

they entred one of their matted Houses, they beheld a most sad spectacle, death having smitten them all save one poore Infant, which lay on the ground sucking the Breast of its dead Mother, seeking to draw living nourishment from her dead breast. Their dead they left oft-times unburied, wherefore the <HI>English</HI> were forced to dig holes, and drag their stinking corps into them.

This yeare was the first choise of Migistrates by free-men, whose number was now increased, fifty three or thereabout, to declare the manner of their Government is by the Author de∣ferred till the year. 1637. where the Reader may behold Go∣vernment both in Churches and Common-wealth, to be an in∣stitution of the Lord, and much availeable through his blessing for the accomplshment of his promises to his people.</P>
<P>This year these fore-runners of the following Army of Christ, after the sight of many of the admirable Acts of his providence for them, begun to take up steddy resolution through the helpe of him to wade through the Ocean, they were farther like to meete withall, and therefore began to plant the yet untilled Earth, having as yet no other meanes to teare up the bushy lands, but their hands and howes, their bodies being in very ill temper by reason of the Scurvy (a Disease in those dayes very frequent) to undergoe such extremity, but being prick'd on with hungers sharpe gode, they keepe doing according to their weake abili∣ties, and yet produce but little food for a long season, but being perswaded that Christ will rather raine bread from Heaven, then his people should want, being fully perswaded, they were set on the worke at his command. Wherefore they followed on with all hands, and the Lord (who hath the Cattell of thousand Hills, and the Corne of ten thousand Vallies, the whole Earth, and fulnesse of it) did now raise up fresh supplies to be added to these both of men and provision of food, men no lesse valiane in Faith then them, the former amongst whom was the Reverend Mr. <HI>Welds</HI> and Mr. <HI>James,</HI> who was welcomed by the people of Christ at <HI>Charles</HI> Towne, and by them called to the Office of a Pastor, where hee continued for some yeares, and from thence removed to <HI>New haven,</HI> upon some seed of prejudice sowne by the enemies of this worke.

<P>Although the great straites this Wildernesse people were in for want of food, was heard of among the godly people in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> yet would they not decline the worke, but men of Estates sold their possessions, and bought plenty of food for the Voyage, which some of them sent before hand, by which meanes they were provided for, as also the Lord put it into the hearts of such as were Masters, and Undertakers of Ships to store their Vessells so well that they had to spare for this peoples need, and further Christ caused abundance of very good Fish to come to their Nots and Hookes, and as for such as were unprovided with these meanes, they caught them with their hands, and so with F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, wild Onions and other Herbs were sweetly satisfied till other provisions, came in, here must labouring men a little be minded, how ill they recompenced those persons, whose estates helpe them to food before they could reape any from the Earth, that forgetting those courtesies they soon by excessive prises took for their worke, made many File-leaders fall back to the next Ranke, advancing themselves in the meane time. About this time the Church of Christ at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> being a diligent people, early prevented their Brethren in other Churches by calling the Re∣verend Mr. <HI>Welds</HI> to be their Pastor, of whom you may see some∣what farther in the following lines:</P>

<P>This yeare of sad distresses was ended with a terrible cold Winter, with weekly Snowes, and fierce Frosts betweene while congealing <HI>Charles</HI> River, as well from the Towne to Sea ward, as above, insomuch that men might frequently passe from one Island to another upon the Ice.

would never hurt her: at the departure of this holy Man of God, many of his peoples hearts waxed very sad, and having looked long for his returne; Their eyes now began to faile in missing of their expectation, they according to their common course in time of great straites, set and appointed a day wholy to be spent in seeking the pleasing Face of God in Christ, purposing the Lord assisting to afflict their soules, and give him the honour of his All-seeingness, by a downe right acknowledgement of their sinnes, but the Lord, whose Grace is alwayes undeserved, heard them before they cried, and the afternoone before the day ap∣pointed brought him, whom they so much desired, in safety to shore, with divers other faithfull servants of Christ ready armed for the Battell, the day was turned to a day of rejoycing and bles∣sing the Lord, even the mighty God of <HI>Iacob,</HI> the God of Armies is for us a refuge high <HI>Shela.</HI></P>

<P>HEre againe the admirable Providence of the Lord is to be noted, That whereas the Country is naturally subject to drought, even to the withering of their summers Fruits, the Lord was pleased, during these yeares of scarcity, to blesse that small quantity of Land they planted with seasonable showers, and that many times to the great admiration of the Heathen, for thus it befell: the extreame parching heare of the Sun (by reason of a more constant clearnesse of the Aire then usually is in <HI>England)</HI> began to scorch the Herbs and Fruits, which was the chiefest meanes of their livelyhood, they beholding the Hand of the Lord stretched out against them, like tender hearted Children, they fell down on their knees, begging mercy of the Lord, for their Saviours sake, urging this as a chiefe argument, that the malignant adversary would rejoyce in their destruction, and blaspheme the pure Ordinances of CHRIST, trampling down his Kingly Commands with their owne inventions, and in uttering these words, their eyes dropped down many teares,

their affections prevailing so strong, that they could not refraine in the Church-Assembly. Here admire and be strong in the Grace of Christ, all you that hopefully belong unto him, for as they powred out water before the Lord, so at that very instant, the Lord showred down water on their Gardens and Fields, which with great industry they had planted, and now had not the Lord caused it to raine speedily, their hope of food had beene lost: but at this these poore wormes were so exceedingly taken, that the Lord should shew himselfe so neere unto their Prayers, that as the drops from Heaven fell thicker, and faster, so the teares from their eyes by reason of the sudden mixture of joy and sor∣row, and verily they were exceedingly stirred in their affections, being unable to resolve themselves, which mercy was greatest, to have a humble begging heart given them of God, or to have their request so suddenly answered.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> hearing hereof, and seeing the sweet raine that fell, were much taken with Englishmens God, but the Lord seeing his poore peoples hearts were to narrow to beg, his bounties exceeds toward them at this time, as indeed hee ever hitherto hath done for this Wildernesse-People, not onely giving the full of their requests, but beyond all their thoughts, as witnesse his great worke in <HI>England</HI> of late, in which the prayers of Gods people in <HI>New England</HI> have had a great stroke; These people now rising from their knees to receive the rich mercies of Christ, in the refreshed fruits of the Earth; Behold the Sea also bring∣ing in whole Ship-loades of mercies, more being filled with fresh forces, for furthering this wonderfull worke of Christ, and indeed this yeare came in many pretious ones, whom Christ in his grace hath made much use of in these his Churches, and Com∣mon-wealth, insomuch that these people were even almost over-ballanced with the great income of their present possessed mercies, yet they addresse themselves to the Sea shore, where they courteously welcom the famous servant of Christ, grave god∣ly and judicious <HI>Hooker,</HI> and the honoured servant of Christ, M <HI>John Haynes,</HI> as also the Reverend and much desired Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> and the Retoricall, M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Stone,</HI> with divers others of the sincere servants of Christ, comming with their young, and with their old, and with their whole substance, to doe him service in

Thus this poore people having now tast∣ed liberally of the salvation of the Lord every way, they deeme it high time to take up the Cup of thankfulnesse, and pay their vowes to the most high God, by whom they were holpen to this purpose of heart, and accordingly set apart the 16. day of <HI>October</HI> (which they call the eighth Moneth, not out of any pe∣vish humor of singularity, as some are ready to censor them with, but of purpose to prevent the Heathenish and Popish ob∣servation of Dayes, Moneths and Yeares, that they may be for∣gotten among the people of the Lord) this day was solemnly kept by all the seven Churches, rejoycing in the Lord, and ren∣dering thanks for all their benefits.</P>

The people of this Church and Towne have hitherto had the chiefest share in spitituall blessings, the Ministry of the Word, by more then ordinary instruments as in due time and place (God willing) you shall farther heare, yet are they at this day in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thriving condition in outward things, also both Corne and Cattell, N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate and Sheepe, of which they have a good flocke, which the Lord hath caused to thrive much in these latter dayes then formerly.</P>
<P>This Towne was appointed to be the seate of Government, but it continued not long, this yeare a small gleane of Rye was brought to the Court as the first fruits of English graine at which this poore people greatly rejoyced to see the Land would beare it, but now the Lords blessing that way hath exceeded all peoples expectation, cloathing the Earth with plenty of all kinde of graine. Here minde I must the Reader of the admirable acts of Christs Providence toward this people, that although they were in such great straites for foode, that many of them eate their Bread by waight, and had little hopes of the Earths fruit∣fullnesse, yet the Lord Christ was pleased to refresh their spirits with such quickning grace, and lively affections to this Temple-worke, that they did not desert the place; and that which was more remarkable, when they had scarce houses to shelter them∣selves, and no doores to hinder the <HI>Indians</HI> accesse to all they had in them, yet did the Lord so awe their hearts, that although they frequented the <HI>Englishmens</HI> places of aboade, where their whole substance, weake Wives and little ones lay open to their plunder; during their absence being whole dayes at Sabbath. Assemblies, yet had they none of their food or stuffe diminished, neither Children nor Wives hurt in the least measure, although the <HI>Indians</HI> came commonly to them at those times, much hun∣gry belly (as they use to say) and were then in number and strength beyond the <HI>English</HI> by far.</P>
<P>Yet further see the great and noble Acts of Christ toward this his wandering people, feeling againe the scarcity of foode, and being constrained to come to a small pittance daily, the Lord to provide for them, causeth the Deputy of <HI>Ireland</HI> to set forth a great Ship unknowne to this people, and indeed small reason in his own apprehensions why he should so do (but Christ will
<PB N="62" REF="34"/>
have it so.) This Ship ariving, being filled with food, the godly Governors did so order it that each Town sent two men aboard of her, who tooke up their Townes allowance, it being ap∣pointed before hand, what their portion should be, to this end that some might not by all, and others be left destitute of food. In the vernall of the yeare 1634. This people being increased, and having among them many pretious esteemed instruments for furthering this wonderous worke of Christ, they began to thinke of fortifying a small Island about two miles distant from <HI>Boston</HI> to Sea-ward, to which all the Vessells come in usually and passe. To this end the honoured Mr. <HI>John Winthrope</HI> with some 8. or 10. persons of no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, tooke boate and arrived on the said Island in a warme Sun shineday, just at the breaking up of Winter as they deemed, but being they were sulden surprised with a cold North-west storme (which is the sharpest winde in this Country) freezing very vehemently for a day and a night, that they could not get off the Island, but were forced to lodge there, and lie in a heape one upon another (on the ground) to keepe themselves from freezing.</P>
<P>This yeare 1634. the much honoured <HI>Thomas Dudly</HI> Esquire, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1634.</NOTE> was chosen Governor, and Mr. <HI>Roger Ludlow</HI> Deputy Gover∣nor, the Freemen added to this little Common-wealth this year were about two hundred and foure, about this time a sincere servant of <HI>Christ</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> was added to the Chureh of <HI>Christ</HI> at New-towne, as a meet helpe to instruct the People of Christ there, with the above named Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> and as he hath hether∣to bin (through the blessing of God) an able instrument in his hands to further the worke.

<P>NOw my loving Reader, let mee lead thee by the hand to our Native Land, although it was not intended to speake in particulars of any of these peoples departure from thence, purposing a generall relation should serve the turne, yet come with mee and behold the wonderous worke of <HI>Christ</HI> in pre∣serving two of his most valiant Sou'diers, namely Mr. <HI>John Nor∣ton;</HI> and that soule ravishing Minister Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepheard,</HI> who came this yeare to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> to ship themselves for <HI>New England,</HI> where the people of God resorted privately unto them to hear them Preach, during the time of their aboade the Ene∣mies of Christs Kingdome were not wanting to use all meanes possible to intrap them, in which perilous condition they re∣mained about two months, waiting for the Ships readinesse, in which time some persons eagerly hunting for Mr. <HI>Thomas Shep∣heard,</HI> began to plot (for apprehending of him) with a Boy of sixteene or seventeene yeares of Age, who lived in the House where hee Lodged to open the doore for them at a certaine houre in the night; But the Lord Christ, who is the Shepheard of <HI>Israel</HI> kept a most sure watch over his indeared servants, for thus it befell, the sweet words of grace falling from the of lips of this Reverend and godly Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepheard</HI> in the hearing of the Boy (the Lords working withall) hee was perswaded this was an holy man of God, and therefore with many troubled thoughts, began to relate his former practise, although hee had a great some of money promised him, onely to let them in at the houre and time appointed; but the Boy, the more neere the time came, grew more pensive and sad, insomuch that his Master
<PB N="65" REF="35"/>
taking notice thereof began to question him about the cause of his heavinesse, who being unwilling to reveale the matter, held of from confessing a long time, till by urgent and insinuating search of his godly Master, with teares hee tells that on such a night hee had agreed to let in Men to apprehend the godly Preacher. The good Man of the house forthwith gave notice thereof unto them, who with the helpe of some well-affected persons was convay'd away by boate through a back Lane, the men at the time appointed came to the house, where finding not the doore open (when they lifted up the Latch) as they expect∣ed, they thrust their staves under it to lift it from the hookes, but being followed by some persons, whom the good man of the house had appointed for that end: yet were they boulstred out in this their wicked act by those who set them one worke. Not∣withstanding they were greatly ashamed when they mist of their end.</P>
<P>But the Lord Christ intending to make his <HI>New England</HI> Souldiers the very wounder of this Age, brought them into grea∣ter straites, that this <HI>Wonder Working Providence</HI> might the more appeare in their deliverance, for comming a shipboard, and hoiseing saile to accomplish their Voyage, in little time after they were tossed and sore beaten with a contrary winde, to the losse of the Ships upper worke, with which losse and great pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill they were driven back againe, the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> intending to confirme their Faith in shewing them, that although they were brought back, as it were into the mouth of their enemies, yet hee could hide them from the hand of the Hunter, for the space of six moneths longer or thereabout, even till the Spring of the yeare following, at which time (God willing) you shall hear of them againe, in the meane time the Master, and other Sea men made a strange construction of the sore storme they met withall, saying, their Ship was bewitched, and therefore made use of the common Charme ignorant people use, nailing two red hot horse-shoos to their maine mast.

This Towne is scituated on a faire and delightfull River, whose first rise or spring begins about five and twenty Miles farther up in the Countrey, issuing forth a very pleasant pond. But soone after it betakes its course through a most hideous swamp of large extent, even for many Miles, being a great Harbour for Beares: after its comming forth this place, it groweth larger by the in∣come of many small Rivers, and issues forth in the Sea, due East over against the Island of <HI>Sholes,</HI> a great place of fishing for out <HI>English</HI> Nation, the peopling of this Towne is by men of good ranke and quality, many of them having the yearly Revenue of large Lands in <HI>England</HI> before they came to this Wildernesse, but their Estates being imployed for Christ, and left in banke, as you have formerly heard, they are well content till Christ shall be pleased to-restore it againe to them or theirs, which in all reason should be out of the Prelates Lands in <HI>England.</HI> Let all those, whom it concernes (to judge) consider it well, and do Justice herein.</P>
<P>This Towne lies in the <HI>Saggamooreship,</HI> or Earldome of <HI>Ag∣gawam,</HI> now by our <HI>English</HI> Nation called <HI>Essex.</HI> It is a very good Haven Towne, yet a little barr'd up at the Mouth of the River, some Marchants here are, (but <HI>Boston,</HI> being the chiefest place of resort of Shipping, carries away all the Trade) they have very good Land for Husbandry, where Rocks hinder not the course of the Plow: the Lord hath beene pleased to increase them in Corne and Cattell of late; Insomuch that they have many hundred quarters to spare yearly, and feed, at the latter end of Summer, the Towne of <HI>Boston</HI> with good Beefe a their Houses are many of them very faire built with pleasant Gardens and Orchards, consisting of about one hundred and forty Families.

Among all the godly Women that came through the perilous Seas to war their warfare, the wife of this zealous Teacher, Mrs. <HI>Sarah Simmes</HI> shall not be omitted, nor any other, but to avoid tediousnesse the vertuous Woman, in∣dued by Christ with graces fit for a Wildernesse condition, her courage exceeding her stature, with much cheerfulnesse did un∣dergoe all the difficulties of these times of straites, her God through Faith in <HI>Christ</HI> supplying all her wants with great indu∣stry, nurturing up her young Children in the feare of the Lord, their number being ten both Sons and Daughters, a certaine signe of the Lords intent to people this vast Wildernesse: God grant they may be valiant in Faith against Sin, Satan and all the enemies of <HI>Christs</HI> Kingdome, following the example of their Father, and Grandfather, who have both suffered for the same, in remem∣brance of whom these following lines are placed.</P>

<P>After these poore people had welcomed with great joy their newcome Guests, all of a sudden they spy two tall Ships, whose colours shewed them to be some forrein Nation, at which time this little handfull of people began to be much troubled, deem∣ing them to be Rovers, they gathered together such forces as their present condition would afford, very ill fitted as then to rescue an enemy, but their Lord and Master <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> would not suffer any such to come, and instead of enemies brought in friends, even Dutchmen to furnish them with farther necessary Provision.</P>

<P>The many Souldiers and Officers of <HI>Christ</HI> that came over this yeare, moved some wonder in the mindes of those, whom he had beene pleased to give a great measure of discerning, yet here they fell abundantly short, deeming almost an impossibility of improving their Talents in this Wildernesse, the <HI>Indian-</HI>people being uncapable of understanding their Language, the <HI>English▪</HI> congregations that were already set downe, being fully furnish∣ed with Teaching Elders, and that which was most strange they were perswaded they should meet with no enemies to oppose them, as if <HI>Christ</HI> would lead them forth into the Field in vaine. But <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> having the hearts of all Men opened before him, soon shewed them, their worke, and withall made roome for them to set downe, I and many more beside, yea, and beyond expectation made this poore barren Wildernesse be∣come a fruitfull Land unto them that waited on him for the ac∣compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing thereof, feeding them with the flower of Wheat, as in its time and place (God willing) shall be shewed, although it pleased him this yeare to visit them, and try them againe with a great scarcity of Bread, by reason of the multitude that came brought somewhat shorter Provisions then ordinary, which caused them to be in some straites. But their <HI>Lord Christ</HI> gives cut a Word of command to those, who occupy their businesse in the great deepe, to furnish from <HI>Ireland</HI> some Ships laden with food for his people.</P>
<P>Also hee commands the Winds and the Seas to beare up these Ships, and blow them forth on their way, till they arrive among his people in <HI>New England,</HI> whose appetities were now sharpe∣set for Bread.

<P>Yet farther to tell of the hard labours this people found in Planting this Wildernesse, after some dayes spent in search, toy∣ling in the day time as formerly is said; like true <HI>Jacob,</HI> its they rest them one the Rocks where the night takes them, their short repast is some small pittance of Bread, if it hold out, but as for Drinke they have plenty, the Countrey being well watered in all places that yet are found out, their farther hardship is to travell, sometimes they know not whether, bewildred indeed without sight of Sun, their compasse miscarrying in crouding through the Bushes, they sadly search up and down for a known way, the <HI>Indians</HI> paths being not above one foot broad, so that a man may travell many dayes and never find one. But to be sure the directing Providence of Christ hath beene better unto them than many paths, as might here be inserted, did not hast call my Pen away to more waighty matters; yet by the way a touch thus, it befell with a servant maide, who was travelling a∣bout three or foure miles from one Towne to another, loosing her selfe in the Woods, had very diligent search made after her for the space of three dayes, and could not possible be found,
<PB N="83" REF="44"/>
then being given over as quite lost, after three dayes and nights, the Lord was pleased to bring her feeble body to her own home in safety, to the great admiration of all that heard of it. This intricate worke no whit daunted these resolved servants of Christ to goe on with the worke in hand, but lying in the open aire, while the watery Clouds poure down all the night season, and sometimes the driving Snow dissolving on their backs, they keep their wee cloathes warme with a continued fire, till the renew∣ed morning give fresh opportunity of further travell; after they have thus found out a place of aboad, they burrow themselves in the Earth for their first shelter under some Hill-side, casting the Earth aloft upon Timber; they make a smoaky fire against the Earth at the highest side, and thus these poore servants of Christ provide shelter for themselves, their Wives and little ones, keep∣ing off the short showers from their Lodgings, but the long raines penetrate through, to their great disturbance in the night season: yet in these poore <HI>Wigwames</HI> (they sing Psalmes, pray and praise their God) till they can provide them houses, which ordinarily was not wont to be with many till the Earth, by the Lorde bles∣sing, brought forth Bread to feed them, their Wives and little ones, which with sore labours they attaine every one that can lift a hawe to strike it into the Earth, standing stoutly to their labours, and teare up the Rootes and Bushes, which the first yeare beares them a very thin crop, till the soard of the Earth be rotten, and therefore they have been forced to cut their bread very thin for a long season. But the Lord is pleased to provide for them great store of Fish in the spring time, and especially Alewives about the bignesse of a Herring, many thousands of these, they used to put under their <HI>Indian</HI> Corne, which they plant in Hills five foote asunder, and assuredly when the Lord created this Corne, hee had a speciall eye to supply these his peoples wants with it, for ordinarily five or six graines doth produce six hundred.</P>
<P>As for flesh they looked not for any in those times (although now they have plenty) unlesse they could barter with the <HI>Indians</HI> for Venison or Rockoons, whose flesh is not much inferiour un∣to Lambe, the toile of a new Plantation being like the labours of <HI>Hercules</HI> never at an end, yet are none so barbarously bene

(under the <HI>Mattacusets</HI> especially) but with a new Plantation they ordinarily gather into Church-fellowship, so that Pastor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and people suffer the inconveniences together, which is a great meanes to season the sore labours they undergoe, and verily the edge of their appetite was greater to spirituall duties at their first comming in time of wants, than afterward: many in new Plan∣tations have been forced to go barefoot, and bareleg, till these latter dayes, and some in time of Frost and Snow: Yet were they then very healthy more then now they are: in this Wilder∣nesse-worke men of Estates speed no better than others, and some much worse for want of being inured to such hard labour, having laid out their estate upon cattell at five and twenty pound a Cow, when they came to winter them with in-land Hay, and seed upon such wild Fother as was never cut before, they could not hold out the Winter, but ordinarily the first or second yeare after their comming up to a new Plantation, many of their Cat∣tell died, especially if they wanted Salt-marshes: and also those, who supposed they should feed upon Swines flesh were cut short, the Wolves commonly feasting themselves before them, who never leave neither flesh nor bones, if they be not seared away be∣fore they have made an end of their meale, as for those who laid out their Estate upon Sheepe, they speed worst of any at the be∣ginning (although some have sped the best of any now) for untill the Land be often fed with other Cattell Sheepe cannot live; And therefore they never thrived till these latter dayes: Horse had then no better successe, which made many an honest Gentleman travell a foot for a long time, and some have even perished with extreame heate in their travells: as also the want of English graine, Wheate, Barly and Rie proved a sore afflicti∣on to some stomacks, who could not live upon <HI>Indian</HI> Bread and water, yet were they compelled to it till Cattell increased, and the Plowes could but goe: instead of Apples and Peares, they had Pomkins and Squashes of divers kinds, their lonesome con∣dition was very grievous to some, which was much aggravated by continuall feare of the <HI>Indians</HI> approach, whose cruelties were much spoken of, and more especially during the time of the <HI>Peqot</HI> wars.</P>
<P>Thus this poore people populate this howling Desart,

marching manfully on (the Lord assisting) through the greatest difficulties, and sorest labours that ever any with such weak means have done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. <HI>Of the first appearing in the Field, of the enemies of Christs people in point of-Reformation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ANd now to follow our first simile of a Souldier, the Lord Christ having safely landed many a valiant Souldier of his on these Westerne shores, drawes hither also the common enemies to Reformation, both in Doctrine and Discipline; But it was for like end, as the Lord sometime drew <HI>Sisera</HI> the Captaine of <HI>Jabins</HI> army to the River <HI>Kishon</HI> for their destruction, onely herein was a wide difference; there <HI>Sisera</HI> was delivered into the hands of a Woman, and here <HI>Sisera</HI> was a woman; their wea∣pons and warre was carnall, these spirituall; there <HI>Jabin</HI> was but a man, here <HI>Jabin</HI> was the common enemy of mans salvation.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1636. the Angels of the severall Churches of Christ in <HI>N. England</HI> sounding forth their silver Trumpets, heard ever and anon the jarring sound of ratling Drums in their eares, striking up an alarum to the battell, it being a frequent thing publikely to oppose the pure and perfect truths of Christ (deli∣vered by the mouth of his Ministers) and that by way of question as the Pharises, Sadduces and Herodians did Christ. But to bring this disorderly worke of theirs into some order, for assuredly could the Author come up to relate the full of the matter in hand, it would through the mercy of Christ make much for the good of Gods people the World throughout, and helpe to dis∣cover the last (I hope) but most subtile practises of Satan to hin∣der the Restauration of the purity of Christs Ordinances in his Churches in all places; As also used by him and his instruments
<PB N="91" REF="48"/>
to divert the hands of those, to whom it belongs, from pulling downe Antichrist, to which end he stirreth up some of his instru∣ments (well educated in the Masking schoole of Hippocrisy) to take upon them this long Voyage, giving them in charge by all meanes to carry it more close, then his Jesuites had done, and for their paines they should have the honours to be counted such, as were of a sharper fight, and deeper discerning then any others. Satan, knowing right well that at the fall of Antichrist hee must be chained up for a thousand years, strives with all the wicked craft his long experienced maliciousnesse could possibly invent, to uphold the same, having already perswaded many that his Kingdome was wholy ruinated with our English Nation, and so diswaded them a long time from further prosecuting against him. But Antichrists Kingdome, as it plainly appeares by Scrip∣ture, consists chiefly in two parts, his deceaveible Doctrines, and his Kingly power. The first of these being in measure abolished, the latter was still retained by the Prelacy, and some Lording Presbytery in greater or lesser measure, as they could attaine un∣to it.</P>
<P>Now Satan, who is daily walking to and fro compassing the Earth, seeing how these resolved Souldiers of Christ in <HI>New England</HI> with indefatigable paines laboured, not onely the finall ruine of Antichrist, in both, but also the advance of Christs Kingdome, in seting up daily Churches according to his first in∣stitution. Wherefore he sets upon a new way to stop (if it were possible) this worke of Reformation, and seeing no other way will serve, he stirs up instruments to cry down Antichrist as much as the most, I and more too, but by this project they should leade people as much out of the way on the other hand, and in the Doctrinall part of Antichrists Kingdome, fall to more hor∣rid Blasphemies then the Papist (as God willing) you shall heare some of them did, namely the <HI>Gortenist,</HI> who most blasphemously professe themselves to be personally the Christ: and as for the other part of his Kingdome, namely the power or Dominion of the beast, this they should with all violence batter downe also, but it must be none other then to make way for their owne ex∣altation, and pay them their wages in the former page promised them, as also withall to overthow the authority Christ hath or∣dained
<PB N="92" REF="49"/>
to be continued in his Churches, in and under him, and furthermore to lock up the Sword of Civill Government for ever, especially in matters that concerne the foure first Com∣mands of God, a cunning way to save the beasts head whole.</P>
<P>You have now heard of the intention, you shall now see their actions. The <HI>Lord Christ</HI> in his boundlesse mercy give all his people eyes to see, and hearts to believe, that after they have in measure escaped the filthy pollutions of the beast, they may not againe be intangled with these damnabled Doctrines, stealing away their hearts by degrees, under a seeming shew of pulling down Antichrist. The Embassadors of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> having full li∣berty to deliver their masters minde, Preach unto all the Doctrine of Free grace, beseeching them to be reconciled unto God in Christ, and that the revealed will of God is, that all should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and that God hath given his onely begotten Son, <HI>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting Life.</HI> Yet withall mind∣ing them that Faith is the gift of God, and none can come un∣to Christ, but such as the Father drawes, and withall that the whole will not see any need of the Phisicians, but the sick, adding also that none can come to the sight of his sicknesse or dead con∣dition but by the Law of God, unlesse they be quicker sighted then the Apostle; They indevour also to build up others in their holy Faith, that they might come to see the Love of God in Christ, which passeth knowledge, and to this end they shew them the fruits of Faith which worketh by love, and that love will be obedient to all the commands of Christ, who saith, <HI>if you love me keepe my Commandements;</HI> And further that Faith purifies the heart, and that a constant supply must be had from Christ. With these and the like sound and wholsome truths the Mini∣sters of Christ feeds their severall flocks in <HI>New England,</HI> drawing their Doctrines plainly from their Text, and substantially back∣ing them with store of Scripture, and undeniable reason, and then delivering to every Man his portion.</P>
<P>But this good old way would not serve the turne with cer∣taine Sectaries that were hither come, who like cunning Sophi∣sters, seeing the bent of the peoples hearts (after so many mer∣cies received) was to magnifie the rich Grace of God in Christ;
<PB N="93" REF="49"/>
they began to tell the people (yet very privately) that the most, if not all the Ministers among them Preached a Covenant of workes, either course or fine, and with a what doe you say to this. They begin to spread their Errors and Herefies, laying the foundation of them as nere the truth as possible they can, the easier to deceive, but in the prosecution, to be sure they ran far enough from it, but to begin; First, they quarrell with the Doctrine of Faith in Christ, and say, a Soule is justified with∣out it.</P>

<P>ANd verily Satane policy here (as in all places where the Lord Christ is acknowledged) was to keepe men from that one right way, by the which hee applies himselfe to the soule, no marvell then if so many Errours arise, like those fained heads of <HI>Hidra,</HI> as fast as one is cut off two stand up in the roome, and chiefly about the uniting of a soule to Christ by Faith. Their Errors in this point they reported to be the judgement of the Reverend and Judicious Mr. <HI>John Cotten;</HI> But hee having spoken for himselfe in his answer to Mr. <HI>Baily,</HI> I forbeare, onely this by the way, take notice of these subtill Projectors, the Erronist I meane, who perceiving this holy man of God Mr. <HI>Cotten</HI> was, and yet is in great esteeme with the people of God, for the great grace Christ hath bestowed upon him in his deepe discerning the mysteries of godlinesse, as also discerning some little difference b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tweene him, and the other Elders about this point, commene upon it, and in large at their pleasure, and then in daily venting their deceivable Doctrines, like subtill Logicians, bring in this as their strongest argument in the last place.

<PB N="94" REF="50"/>
of it: but that you may understand their way of broaching their abominable errors, it was in dividing those things the Lord hath united in his worke of conversion continued, carrying on a Soule to Heaven in these foure Particulars.</P>
<P>First, in dividing betweene the word and the word, under pre∣tence <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Dividing betweene the Word, and the Word.</NOTE> of a legall Gospell, perswading the people their Ministers were legall Preachers, teaching them little better then Popery, and unfit for Gospell Churches, denying them to be any Mini∣sters of Christ that Preach any preparation worke, by shewing men what the Law requires. Here's nothing sayes one of them, but Preaching out of the Law and the Prophets, truly sayes an∣other of them I have not heard a pure Gospell Sermon from any of them, but sure they were both troubled with the Lethargy, or read not the Gospell themselves, for they may finde the A∣postles, yea, and Christ himselfe Preached good Gospell sure, out of the Law and the Prophets.</P>
<P>Secondly, in separating Christ and his Graces, in manifesting himselfe to be in the Soule, and this they say makes much for the <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Christ and his Graces.</NOTE> magnifying of Free-grace, and indeed they made it so free, that the soule that receives it shall never taste any of it by their con∣sent, but remaine still a dry branch as before; these legall Phari∣ses, sayes one of them, tell us of a thing they call inherent grace, and of a man being made a new creature, but I am sure the best of them goe on in their legall duties and performances still, sor∣rowing for sinne hearing of Sermons, observing duty Morning and Evening, and many such like matters. Tush man sayes an∣other of them, you shall hear more then this, I was discoursing with one of their Scholasticall Preachers Disciples, a professed con∣vert, and yet when he came to pray, he beg'd for forgivenesse of his sins, I asked him why he used that vaine repetition, since hee did believe he was justified by Christ already, and hee made me an answer not worth repeating, but when I told him God could see no sinne in his people, no more then I could see that which was covered close from my eye sight; hee told mee I spake little lesse then blasphemy, so ignorant are these men, and their learned guides also; who perswade them the more they have of the in-dwelling of the Spirit of Christ, the better they shall be inabled to these legall duties. Nay, quoth the other, I can tell you
<PB N="95" REF="50"/>
more then all this, they make it an evidence of their good estate, even their sanctification, and yet these men would make people believe they are against Popery.</P>
<P>By this discourse of theirs, you may see the manner how these Erronious, and Hereticall persons batter off the fruit from the goodly branches of Christs vines &amp; make bare the flourishing trees planted in the house of the Lord, and yet professe themselves to be Scholars of the upper forme, that have learned as far as their Masters can teach them, but let me tell you friends you'l prove but trewants if you fall thus to Robbing of Orchards, and its an offence far beyond petty Larceny to rob Christs Garden, let your pretenees be what they will: can it possible be for the magnifying of Christs Grace that the branches growing upon his root shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d remaine fruitlesse? no assuredly, herein God is glorified that his people bring forth much fruit, yet many of these new Gospel∣lers had another plea, hypocrites have a seeming shew of Saints graces by which they deceive themselves and others; And there∣fore because Felons and Traytors coyne counterfeit Gold, there∣fore true Gold should not passe for current, but the intent of the Author is to prosecute the History, these errours being con∣suted already by the able servants of Christ, whom the Lord in his mercy brought hither for that purpose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI. <HI>Of the two latter dividing Principles under which these Erronists fought.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe third dividing tenent by which these persons prosecuted their errors at this time, was betweene the Word of God, <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. The Word, and the spirit.</NOTE> and the Spirit of God, and here these Sectaries had many prety knacks to delude withall, and especially to please the Femall Sex, they told of rare Revelations of things to come from the spirit (as they say) it was onely devised to weaken the Word of the Lord in the mouth of his Ministers, and withall to put both ignorant and unlettered Men and Women, in a posture of Preaching to a multitude, that they might be praised for their able Tongue. Come along with me sayes one of them, i'le bring

you to a Woman that Preaches batter Gospell then any of your black-coates that have been at the Ninneversity, a Woman of another kinde of spirit, who hath had many Revelations of things to come, and for my part, saith hee, I had rather hear such a one that speakes from the meere motion of the spirit, without any study at all, then any of your learned Scollers, although they may be fuller of Scripture (I) and admit they may speake by the helpe of the spirit, yet the other goes beyond them. G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntle Reader, thinke not these things fained, because I name not the parties, or that here is no witnesse to prove them, should I so do: neither of both is the cause I assure you, but being somewhat acquainted with my own weakenesse, should the Lord withdraw the light of his word, and also I verily believe some of them are truly turned againe to the truth, the which I wish to all, yet by relating the story all men may see what a spirit of giddinesse they were given up to, and some of them to strong delusions, even to most horrid and damnable blasphemies, having itching eares, or rather proud desires to become Teachers of others, when they grosly erred in the first Principles of Religion themselves. There was a man in one of the farthest Townes of the <HI>Mattacu∣sets</HI> Government, where they had no Ministers for the present, he being much desirous to shew himfelfe some body in talking to as many as hee could get to hear him one the Sabbath day, mis∣sing some of his Auditors, he meets with one of them some few dayes after, they passing over the water together, where were you quoth he on the Sabbath day that you were not at the meet∣ing? we had a notable piece of Prophecy, quoth the man that was missing, who was it that Preached? The other replying not: his Wife being in presence, answered; it was my husband, nay wife, quoth he thou shoulds not have told him, teach him to stay at home another time.</P>
<P>By this and divers other such like matters, which might be here inserted, you may see how these Sectaries love the prehe∣minence, and for this end seeke to deprive the Ministers of Christ inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igling as many as they can in the head, that they take to much upon them (just like the rebellious <HI>Korath, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram)</HI> scoffing at their Scholler-like way of Preaching, where∣in the grosse dissimulation of these erronious persons hath ap∣peared

exceedingly, as for instance first of a Woman, even the grand M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is of all the rest, who denied the Resurrection from the dead shee and her consorts mightily rayling against learning, perswading all they could to take heed of being spoyled by it, and in the meane time, shee her selfe would dispute (forsooth) and to shew her skill that way, here is a falacy quoth she in this syliogisme: as also one of the <HI>Gortonists,</HI> as shallow a pated Scholler as my selfe, far from understanding Latine, much lesse any other Language the Scriptures were writ in, yet when hee would hold out some of the best of his false Doctrines, as name∣ly, that there were no other Devills but wicked men, nor no such thing as sin, Quoth he that place in the fourth <HI>Psalme,</HI> where men commonly read, <HI>stand in awe and sin not,</HI> in the originall it is read <HI>stand in awe and misse not.</HI> But to go on, at this time there were many strange Revelations told both of Men and Women, as true some of them said as the Scripture, so that surely had this Sect gone on awhile, they would have made a new Bible, and their chief Mistris when she was shipt for <HI>N. England,</HI> what will you say quoth she, and it hath beene revealed to me that we shall be there in six weekes, and one of the femall <HI>Gortonists</HI> said, she was a Pro∣ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tesse, and it was revealed unto her, that shee must prophecy unto the People in the same words the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> did, as also a lusty big man to defend this tenent held forth to his Pastor before the whole Congregation, that the spirit of Revelation came to him as he was drinking a pipe of Tobacco.</P>
<P>The fourth dividing way to bring in their Heresies, was to <NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Christ, and his Ordinan∣ces.</NOTE> devide betweene Christ and his Ordinances, and here they plaid their game to purpose, even to casting down of all Ordinances as carnall, and that because they were polluted by the Ordinance of man, as some of these Sectaries have said to the Minister of Christ, you have cast off the crosse in Baptisme, but you should do well to cast off Baptisme it selfe; as also for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, for to make use of Bread, or the juce of a silly Grape to represent the Body and Bloud of Christ, they accounted it as bad as Negromancy in the Ministers of Christ to pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>forme it. But seeing there will be occasion to bring in a bed∣roule of these Blasphemies in the yeare (43) and (44) take the lesse here; onely minde that these persons being first bewildred
<PB N="98" REF="52"/>
in the deniall of Infants being Baptized, could neither finde right faith to be Baptized into, nor yet any person rightly constituted to Baptize remaining. Seekers they came to this, but yet here must not be omitted the slights these Erronists had to shoulder out the Officers Christ hath ordained, and set up in his Churches; and verily in this point they sided directly with the Papist and Prelates, although in most of the other they went directly out of the way on the other hand. Ignorance say the Papist is the Mo∣ther of devotion, its better say the Protestant Prelates to have (a blind si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>John)</HI> one that cannot tell how to Preach, provided he will conforme to our Ceremonies, than to have one that will Presch constantly, and not conforme also: these Erronist, shew∣ing themselves to be whelps of the same litter, Cry out against a learned Presbitery, as the onely way to captivate liberty, and herein the transformed Devill came to shew his Hornes for why, his errors would not take where the people were followers of their seeing guids, and if it be well noted, here is the Master-piece of all their knavery, the which comes in after this manner, The Lording Prelacy, Popes, Cardinalls, Bishops, Deanes, &amp;c. Were ordinarily brought up at the University to learning, and have most tyrannically abused it: usurping over the People of Christ, and exercised most inhumane and barbarous cruelty up∣on them; as also the Presbyterian Kirke by these Provinciall Classes, men of learning having robbed the particular Congrega∣tions of their just and lawfull priviledges, which Christ hath pur∣chased for them. Each Congregation of his being invested with full power to Administer all the Ordinances he hath ordained, in and toward their owne Members; and further learned men in some places, feeding the people for their Tith-sake in a Parishi∣oniall way, desire the upholding thereof, lest their fat Benefices should grow leane.</P>
<P>Now the Redemption of the people of Christ out of all these bondages, being full of difficulty to attaine, as is abundantly wit∣nessed in the great hardship Gods people have undergon in this Wildernesse-worke; as also much more by that bloudy war so long continved in our Native Country, and the two adjacent Kingdomes. This makes a very faire bottome for those to build upon, who would have the sluce of authority in the Officers

of Christs Churches plucked up, that so their errors might flow in like a floud; And therefore they impannell a Jury of their own Sectaries to passe upon all such as put a higher esteem upon their Pastors and Teachers (in point of discerning the holy things of God) then upon other men, who returne in their Verdit as finding them guilty of the crime above expressed, either as party, or privy abetters unto them, upon this the Vote goes for ad∣vancing such men as will let them out line enough for such as will worke without wages, and give to every man liberty to exercise a large conscience, provided it be his own, and as for authority they would have none used, as being a thing two opposite to li∣berty. My friend cast off as much of thy owne power as thou canst, and beware of Lording it over Gods Heritage, but I pray thee let Christ alone with his, which he hath given to his Pastors and Teachers in administring the holy things of God, peculiar to their Office, and tremble all you Presbyterians, who to please the people prostrate the authority Christ hath put upon the El∣drs of his Churches as Officers, to the resolute liberty of man: the people may and ought to call them to Office, to the which Christ hath united double honour and authority, and appointed them to be had in high esteeme for their worke-sake, being Embassadors of <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI> This may no man take from them, nor yet they themselves cast off, and yet all this makes nothing for the Papall, Prelaticall, Classicall or Parishionall authority of the Presb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tery, for it holds onely in their ruling well, while they rule for Christ, they must and shall have the power hee hath put <NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure score Errors derived from these four heads, and spread abroad in <HI>N.

Oh yee <HI>New England</HI> Men and Women, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth?

Oh quoth he where am I become, is this the place where these Reverend Preachers are fled, that <HI>Christ</HI> was pleased to make use of to rouse up his rich graces in many a drooping soule; here have I met with some that tell mee, I must take a naked <HI>Christ.</HI> Oh, woe is mee if <HI>Christ</HI> be naked to mee, wherewith shall I be cloathed, but me thinks I most wonder they tell me of casting of all godly sorrow for sin as unbeseeming a Soule, that is united to <HI>Christ</HI> by Faith, and there was a little nimbled tongued Woman among them, who said she could bring me ac∣quainted with one of her own Sex that would shew me a way, if I could attaine it, even Revelations, full of such ravishing joy that I should never have cause to be sorry for sinne, so long as I live, and as for her part shee had attained it already: a company of legall Professors, quoth she lie poring on the Law which <HI>Christ</HI> hath abolished, and when you breake it then you breake your joy, and now no way will serve your turne, but a deepe sorrow. These and divers other expressions intimate unto men, that here I shall finde little increase in the Graces of <HI>Christ,</HI> through the hearing of his word Preached, and other of his blessed Ordinan∣ces.

Fare you well, then hasting thither hee croudeth through the thickest, where having stayed while the glasse was turned up twice, the man was metamorphos∣ed, and was faine to hang down the head often, least his watry eyes should blab abroad the secret conjunction of his affections, his heart crying loud to the Lords ecchoing answer, to his blessed spirit, that caused the Speech of a poore weake pale complecti∣oned man to take such impression in his soule at present, by applying the word so aptly, as if hee had beene his Privy Coun∣seller, cleering Christs worke of grace in the soule from all those false Doctrines, which the erronious party had afrighted him withall, and now he resolves (the Lord willing) to live and die with the Ministers of <HI>New England:</HI> whom hee now saw the Lord had not onely made zealous to stand for the truth of his Discipline, but also of the Doctrine, and not to give ground one inch.</P>

<P>ANd here Christian Reader the Author according to his for∣mer practice, must minde thee of the admirable providence of Christ toward his <HI>New England</HI> Churches, in preserving them from these erronious spirits, that have hitherto in all places dog'd the sincere servants of Christ, when ever they have set up∣on a through Reformation, as stories doe abundantly testify, which thing the reverend <HI>Calvine</HI> and divers others, have decla∣red. But seeing the boasting Prelates in these times are ready to say their Lordly power kept these errours under, its plaine otherwise: for Satan saw while people were under their yoake of humane inventions, they were far enough from exalting the Kingdome of Christ; And therefore he reserved these errours, for his last shifts, and further you shall see in the following story that the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> reserved this honour for those, whose love hee had inlarged to follow him in a dezart wildernesse, even with the sharpe sword of the Word, timely to cut off the heads of this <HI>Hidra;</HI> but yet there are two sorts of persons in our Native Country, whom the Elders and Brethren here do highly honour in Christ, and prefer before themselves, namely the godly Pre∣byterian party, and the Congregationall sincere servants of <HI>Christ,</HI> both which the Author could wish, (that with bowells of compassion, sweet simpathising affection of Brethren knit toge∣ther in that transcendent love of Christ, which couples all his distanced flockes together) they would seriously ponder this History, which through the Authors weakenesse wants much of measure, but nothing of the truth of things, so far as a shallow capacity can reach. Of the first sort named, I could wish the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ruterford,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Bayle,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Rathbone,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Paget,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ball,</HI> &amp;c. would but informe themselves further by the truth of this History, supposing they cannot chuse but in a good mea∣sure be satisfied already with the pacificatory and meeke answers of as many Reverend and godly Elders of ours.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="55"/>
Now that I would they should take notice of is, that the Churches of Christ in <HI>New England,</HI> and their Officers have hi∣therto been so far from imbracing the erronious Doctrines of these times, that through the powers of Christ they have vali∣antly defended the truth, and cut down all deceiveable Doctrine; the like hath not been done for many ages heretofore. Reverend and beloved in Christ, could your eyes but behold the efficacy of loving counsell in the Communion of congregationall Churches, and the reverend respect, honour and love, given to all Teach∣ing Elders, charity commands me to thinke you would never stand for Classicall injunctions any more, neither Diocesan, nor Provinciall authority can possible reach so far as this royall Law of love in communion of Churches: verily its more universall then the Papall power, and assuredly the dayes are at hand, where∣in both <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches shall exercise this old Mo∣dell of Church Government, and send their Church salutations and admonitions from one end of the World unto another, when the Kingdomes of the Earth are become our <HI>Lord Christs;</HI> Then shall the exhortation of one Church to another prevaile more to Reformation, then all the thundering Bulls, excomuni∣cating Lordly censures, and shamefull penalties of all the Lord∣ing Churches in the World, and such shall be, and is the efficacy of this intire love one to another, that the withdrawing of any one Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> according to the Rule of the word from those that walke inordinatly, will be more terrible to the Church or Churches so forsaken, then an Army with Banners: yea, and it may be added, because civill Government is like to turne nurse in more places then one, this royall Law of love shall become the Law of Nations, and none will suffer their subjects to rebell against it; but to our beloved brethren in <HI>England</HI> on the other hand, the Reverend M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> Mr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This seemeth you have apprehended our Churches and civill Government, to be too strict in dealing with persons for their sinfull opinions, I wish the offenders be none of your intelligen∣cers, who to be sure will make the worst of things, I know you are in charity with us; And therefore a few words will satisfie, which I hope you want not from your good friends our Reve∣rend Elders, who could wish you as much happinesse as our selves

Neither doe they exercise civill power to bring all under their obedi∣ence to a uniformity in every poyne of Religion, but to keepe them in the unity of the spirit, and the bond of peace, nor yet have they ever mixed their civill powers with the authority pe∣culiarly given by <HI>Christ</HI> to his Churches and Officers of them, but from time to time have laboured to uphold their priviledges, and only communion one with another.</P>
<P>The chiefe Court or supreame power of this little Common-wealth, consists of a mixt company, part Aristocracy, and part Democracy of Magistrates, that are yearly chosen by the major Vote of the whole body of the Free-men throughout the Country; and Deputies chosen by the severall Townes, they have hitherto had about 12. or 13.

<P>The Lord was pleased to furnish these his people with some able instruments in most of their Townes, that were skill'd in Common-wealth work, out of which they chose their Deputies, whose number was ordinarily between 30. and 40. some of them there will be occasion to speake of among their Military Men, but see here the <HI>Wonder-working Providence of Sions Saviour,</HI> ap∣pears much in gathering together stones to build up the walls of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> (that his <HI>Sion</HI> may be surrounded with Bulworkes and Towres) with a whispering word in the eares of his servants, he crosses the Angles of <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Cornewall</HI> to <HI>Kent,</HI> from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Barwick,</HI> not leaving out <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> Wise men are perswaded to the worke without arguing like <HI>Elisba,</HI> when <HI>Elias</HI> cast his mantle on him, so these men make no stop, but say suffer me onely to sell my inheritance, and I will away for <HI>New England.</HI> And now I could wish our Brethren in <HI>England</HI> would not be angry with us for making such hast.

like Grashoppers, no more could they thresh and cleane up any Wheate for the Lords Garner, but the Prelates would presently be upon their backs, and plow long furrowes there, and you may believe it, if you will (for it is certaine) many, had not this little number gone forth to blow their Trumpets, and breake their Pitchers, making the brightnesse of their Lamps appeare, surely the host of the <HI>Midianites</HI> had never been put to flight, and if still any of our Brethren shall contend with us, wee answer with <HI>Gideon,</HI> the Lord hath delivered into your hands the chiefe Princes of <HI>Midian,</HI> and what were we able to do in comparison of you; yet shall we not cease to follow on the worke of Refor∣mation, although weake and faint, till the Lord be pleased to free his <HI>Israel</HI> from all their enemies; and verily <HI>England</HI> hath not wanted the Prayers of the poore people of <HI>Christ</HI> here.

<P>The Authors end in naming some few is for none other end, but to make good the title of this Book &amp; to incourage all the servants of <HI>Christ</HI> for time to come wholely to rely upon him, when they go about any difficult work, which may tend to the glory of his Name. Who could have told these men, being scattered abroad throughout the Island of Great <HI>Brittaine,</HI> they should meete on a Wildernesse nine hundered Leagues remote, and there keep Court together to study the preservation of <HI>Christs</HI> poore scattered flockes? nay brethren, when you first tooke book in hand to learne your Letters, you would have been very dull pates, but for this worke; assuredly, how you came by large inheritances, some of you, and estates of hundreds, and thousands, your selves best know, but believe it, the Lord intended it for this very work, <HI>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse of it,</HI> then let none of the people of <HI>Christ</HI> mourn that they have spent their wealth in this Wildernesse, if it have holpe on the worke, rather rejoyce that <HI>Christ</HI> hath betrusted thee to be Steward for the King of Kings, &amp;

that in so noble an achievement the worthiest worke that the me∣mory of our selves, and our fore-fathers can reach unto.</P>
<P>And brethren, as for the good parts and gifts the Author hath commended you for, but for the edifying of the body of <HI>Christ,</HI> and assisting his people in this work you had been empty of all good.</P>
<P>And now seeing it is the opinion of many in these dayes of Reformation, that all sorts of Sectaries (that acknowledge a <HI>Christ)</HI> should be tolerated by civill Government, except Papist, and this Government hath hitherto, and is for future time resol∣ved to practice otherwise (the Lord assisting) having met already with more blasphemous Sectaries, then are Papists; wherefore it will not be amisse if our Countrymen be acquainted with the one and twenty yeares experience of this Wildernesse worke, in point of Government. First, it is their judgment, and that from Scripture taught them, that those, who are chose to place of go∣vernment, must be men truly fearing God, wise and learned in the truths of <HI>Christ,</HI> (if so) as hitherto it hath been <HI>New Englands</HI> practice, then surely such will be utterly unfit to tolerate all sorts of Sectaries, as because they have taken up <HI>Joshuas</HI> resolution, to serve the Lord, &amp; a man cannot serve two Masters, much lesse many Masters; Then surely such as would have all sorts of sinfull opi∣nions upheld by the civill government, must be sure to make choise of the most <HI>Atheisticall</HI> persons they can finde to governe, such as are right <HI>Gallios:</HI> for <HI>N.

England</HI> (I meane the better part) be perswaded to set up any other to governe, but such as are zealous for the maintainance of the truths of <HI>Christ;</HI> yet of late there is a buzzing noise, as if it were injury to the Churches for civill power to medle in matters of Religion, but to
<PB N="112" REF="59"/>
be sure there are many that strive for a Toleration, yet the people of <HI>Christ,</HI> who are the naturall Mothers of this Government, re∣solve never to see their living child so divided, looking at such a government to be no better to them, a living child divided in twaine; and therefore desires their loving Countrymen to beare with them in this point, and if any notwithstanding shall force it to be so, we shall shew our natural affection, and leave all to them, chusing rather to dwell on the backside of this Desert (a place as yet unaccessible) knowing assuredly our God will appeare for our deliverance. Yet let them also know the Souldiers of <HI>Christ</HI> in <HI>N E.</HI> are not of such a pusillanimous spirit, but resolve as that valiant <HI>Jeptha</HI> did to keep in possession, the Towns his God had given them, so we are resolved (the Lord willing) to keepe the go∣vernment our God hath given us, and for witnesse hee hath so done, let this History manifest: for we chose not the place for the Land, but for the government, that our <HI>Lord Christ</HI> might raigne over us, both in Churches and Common-wealth, and al∣though the Lord have been pleased by an extraordinary blessing upon his peoples industry to make the place fruitfull (as at this day indeed it is) yet all may know the land in it selfe is very ster∣rill, but the upholding of the truths of <HI>Christ,</HI> is chiefe cause why many have hitherto come: and further if the servants of <HI>Christ</HI> be not much mistaken, the downfall of <HI>Antichrist</HI> is at hand, and then the Kingdome of the Earth shall become the Kingdome of our <HI>Lord Christ</HI> in a more peculiar manner, then now they are, and surely godly civill government shall have a great share in that worke, for they are exhorted to fill her double of the Cup, shee hath given to them; and also know our Magistrates, being con∣scious of ruling for <HI>Christ,</HI> dare not admit of any bastardly brood to be nurst up upon their tender knees, neither will any Christian of a sound judgement vote for any, but such as earnesty con∣tend for the Faith, although the increase of Trade, and traffique may be a great inducement to some.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of the wonderfull deliverance wrought by the Lord Christ, for his poore</HI> New England <HI>Churches, in freing them from the fear of their Malignant adversaries, who forc't, them to this Wildernesse.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ANd now to the third and great distresse, which lay behind them by reason of their back friends, the Lording Bi∣shops, and other Malignant adversaries, being daily exasperated against them, and in especiall at this time by one <HI>Merton,</HI> who named himselfe the Host of <HI>Merrimount,</HI> who wanted not ma∣lice, could he possible have attained meanes to effect it; But the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> prevented both him and his Masters, whom with slattery he sought to please with scurrillous deriding the servants of <HI>Christ,</HI> to bring them into contempt, yet the Lord prevented

all, and delivered this wretched fellow into his peoples hands againe after all this, who dealt as favourably with him as <HI>David</HI> did with <HI>Shimmei.</HI> Besides this, the evill usage that many of the beloved servants of Christ had from the hands of those in office at their departure, declared plainely, that there were some, who would willingly have pursued them to bring them under bon∣dage againe, herein their answer was that they should stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, who was now resolved to fight for them against his and their implacable enemies; although more mighty than they: and indeed all meanes of resistance in the hand of man being so small, that it could not possible bee discerned by any morcall eye; yet will the Lord worke by means and not by miracle; when the Lord called forth <HI>Joshua</HI> to fight with <HI>Amaleck,</HI> his <HI>Moses</HI> must be in the Mount at Prayers; see∣ing this answer deeply concernes the dearly beloved of our <HI>Lord Christ</HI> remaining in <HI>England,</HI> let them listen to the answer.</P>
<P>Also how came it to passe that the Lord put it into your hearts to set upon a Reformation, was it not by prayer attained? You are not excluded, although the Churches of Christ here are for the present in the Mount, and you in the Vally fighting, yet surely they had neede of helpe to hold up their hands, whereas the nerenesse of the danger to you in the enemies overcoming, is a great motive to keepe up yours stedy, yet may you say right∣ly to the Churches of Christ here, as <HI>Mordachy</HI> to <HI>Hester</HI> the Queene, if you hold your peace deliverance shall come another way, and thinke not to escape, because you are in <HI>New England;</HI> Assuredly the Lord is doing great things, and waites for the prayers of his people that he may be gratious unto them, and ve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily the poore Churches of Christ heere cannot but take notice of the great workes the Lord hath done for you of late, which are famous throughout the whole World; And should they not take them as an answer of these weake prayers, they feare they should neglect to magnify his mercy toward you, and them: the noble acts of the Lord Christ, for the freedome of his people from that into lerable Prelaticall bondage, are almost miraculously committed to memory by the able servants of Christ, whom hee hath stirred up for that very end, yet must you not shut out the valiant souldiers of Christ (disciplin'd in this unwonted Wilder∣nesse)
<PB N="104" REF="64"/>
from having share with you in the worke, yet no farther but that Christ may be all in all: who hath caused the <HI>Midianites</HI> to fight against <HI>Midian,</HI> till the true <HI>Israelites</HI> had gathered themselves together, hee it is that hath brought the counsells of the wicked to naught, hee it is that hath discovered the secret plo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tings of the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> even in his Bed-chamber; Hee it is that hath declared himself to be with your mighty men of va∣lour, and assuredly all you valiant Souldiers of Christ, both in one <HI>England</HI> and the other, the Lord hath shewed you as great signes and wonders for the strengthening of your faith, as was the wetting and drying of the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ece to <HI>Gedeon,</HI> onely beware of setting up an <HI>Ephod</HI> in the latter end; Let the Churches of Christ be set up according to his first institution, or you will make double worke, for all may see by what is done already, there is nothing too hard for him, hee will downe with all againe and againe, till his Kingdom alone be exalted, for the which all the <HI>Israel</HI> of God fight, wrastle, pray, and here you may see the servants of Christ fighting at 900 leagues distant.</P>
<P>Oh you proud Bishops, that would have all the World stoope to your Lordly power, the heathen Romans your predecessors, after they had banished <HI>John</HI> to the Isle of <HI>Pathmos,</HI> suffered him quietly to injoy the Revelation of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> there; here is a people that have betaken themselves to a newfound World, di∣stanced from you with the widest Ocean the World affords, and yet you grudge them the purity of Christs Ordinances there. No wonder then, nay wonder all the World at the sudden and unexpected downfall of these domineering Lords, who had Princes to protect them, armes to defend them, and almost three whole Kingdomes at their command; and no enemy of theirs in sight onely, there appeares a little cloud about the bignesse of a mans hand out of the <HI>Westerne</HI> Ocean, I but the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> is in it, out of <HI>Sion</HI> the perfection of beauty hath God shined. Our God shall come, and shall not keepe silence, a Fire shall devour afore him, &amp; mighty tempests shall be moved round about him. Now gather together you King-like Bishops, and make use of all the Kingly power you can, for the cloud is suddenly come up, he rode upon Cherub and did flie. And now let the Children of <HI>Sion</HI> rejoyce in their King, for the Lord hath pleasure in his
<PB N="105" REF="64"/>
people, hee will make the meeke glorious by deliverance; And that the whole Earth may know it is the Lords owne worke, the Arch-prelate and his complices must begin to war with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and that implacably, the Prelates desire a <HI>Parliament</HI> thinking to establish iniquity by a Law, but the iniquity of the <HI>Ammo∣rites</HI> is already full, and all your cunning counsells shall but con∣trive your owne destruction; They remonstrant against all Acts of <HI>Parliament</HI> that passe without their Vote, and by this means wind out themselves for ever voting more, they devise how they may have such persons committed to prison at favour not their proceeding.</P>
<P>But the Lord turned their mischiefe they had conceived upon their own pates, and they themselves were sent to prison by halfe a score at a time; And such was the unsavourynesse of this seem∣ing salt, that it was good for nothing, but to Lord it over others, their tyranny being taken out of their hands, they could not in∣dure to be commanded by any; And therefore unfit for the war which they stirred up, to recover the people againe under their bondage, yet such was the madnesse of some, that they loved their servitude so well as to fight for it; but surely such had never rightly knowne the service of the <HI>Lord Christ,</HI> which is perfect freedome, from all such tyrannous yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, and verily just it is with the Lord to cause such to be servants unto <HI>Shishak,</HI> that they may know the service of the Lord, and the service of the Kingdomes of the Country. But however an Army is raised to defend their Lordly dignity; Let the Saints be joyfull with glo∣ry, let the high Acts of God be in their mouths, and a two edged Sword in their hands, to bind their Kings in chaines, and their Nobles in setters of Iron, the Charets of the Lord are twenty thousand thousands of Angells, the Lord is among them as in <HI>Sinai,</HI> Kings of Armies did flee apace; and now you that have borne such a wicked spirit of malignity against the people of Christ, can your hearts indure, and your hands wax strong in the day that he shall have to doe with you? Oh you proud Pre∣lates that boast so much of your taking the Kings part, miserable partakers are you; in stead of obeying him, you have caused him to obey you, its writ in such great capitall letters that a child may read it: what was the cause of the first raising war against
<PB N="106" REF="65"/>
the <HI>Scots</HI> which occasioned the <HI>Parliament,</HI> when you saw they would not further the war as you would have them, they were soone traytors in your account, and prosecuted against with Ar∣my after army, and was not all this to make the Scots receive your Injunctions, a very fayer bottom to build a bloudy war upon, that the Prelatticall power might Lord it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as they of a long time had done in <HI>England:</HI> it was your <HI>Pithagorian</HI> Phy∣losophy that caused the King to loose his Life, by perswading him his Kingly power lived in your Lordly dignity, as a thing sub∣ordinate unto it, and he so deeply taken with this conceit, that it cost the lives of many thousands more then ever hee, or his Father would doe for saving or recovering the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>latine Coun∣try.</P>
<P>Experience hath taught the savage <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom we live, that they may and doe daily bring Wolves to be came, but they cannot breake them of their ravening nature, and I would your Royalist would learne of them to know, that as your Lord Bishops, Deanes, Prebends, &amp;c. be right whelps of the <HI>Roman</HI> litter, so let them be never so well cam'd, they will retaine their nature still, to Lord it over all kinde of Civill Government; But woe and alasse that ever any of our Countrymen should be so blind, that after they are delivered from so great a bondage by such <HI>Wonder Working Providence of the Lord Christ;</HI> Ever and anon to indeavour to make a Captaine over them, that they may returne againe into <HI>Egypt,</HI> as appeares by the plots which have beene discovered, and broken in pieces by the right hand of the most high, and yet for all this their's such a hankering after some∣what of the Prelaticall greatnesse; by the <HI>English</HI> Clergy, and the <HI>Scottish</HI> Classis, that many of them could afford to raise ar∣other war for it. But brethren I beseech you be more wiser, lest when you are growne hot in your quarrell, the Malignant party come and set you agreed stablish peace in righteousnesse, and let the word be your rule, heare one another with meekenesse, and the Lord will cleare up the whole truth unto you in his due time; And now to declare plainly how far the Lord hath beene pleased to make use of any of his people in these <HI>Westerne</HI> pares, about this Worke, for to say truth they have done nothing in holes and corners, but their workes are obvious to all the World: if
<PB N="107" REF="65"/>
he sufferings of the Saints be pretious in the eyes of Christ, so as to provoke him in displeasure to cut off the occasioners thereof, then thus his poore unworthy people here have had a great stroake in the downfall of their adversaries to the present posses∣sed truths of Christ, for this wildernesse worke, hath not beene carried on without sighthings that have come before him, and Groanes that have entred his eares, and Teares treasured up in his bottles (againe) if the ardent and strong affections of the people of God, for his glorious comming to advance his King∣dome in the splendor, and purity of his Gospell, as co cry with the holy Prophet, <HI>Oh that he would broake the Heavens and come down;</HI> be regarded of the <HI>Lord Christ,</HI> so as to remove with his mighty power the very Mountaines out of the way, and hurle them into the deepe; Then hath these weake wormes instru∣mentally had a share in the great desolation the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> hath wrought. For this History will plainely declare with what zeale and deepe affection, and unresistable resolutions these Pil∣grim people have endeavoured the gathering together his Saints, for the edifying the Body of Christ, that he may raign both Lord and King for ever.</P>
<P>Yet againe, if the prayers of the faithfull people of God availe any thing for the accomplishment of his promises, in the de∣struction of Antichrist, for the subduing of Armies without strik∣ing one stroake; Then assuredly these <HI>Jacobites</HI> have wrestled with the Lord, not onely (with that good King <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oshaphat)</HI> proclaiming one Fast, but many Fasts, they, their Wives and little ones standing before the Lord; Oh our God wile thou not judge them for we have no might, &amp;c. Lastly, if the Lord himselfe have roared from <HI>Sion,</HI> (as in the dayes of the Prophet <HI>Amos)</HI> so from his Churches in <HI>New England,</HI> by a great and terrible Earth quake (which happened much about the time the Lordly Prelates were preparing their injunctions for <HI>Scotland)</HI> taking rise from the West, it made its progresse to the Eastward, cau∣sing the Earth to rise up and downe like the waves of the Sea; having the same effect on the Sea also, causing the Ships that lay in the Harbor to quake, the which, at that very time was said to be a signe from the Lord to his Churches, that he was purposed to shake the Kingdomes of <HI>Europes</HI> Earth, and now by his pro∣vidences
<PB N="108" REF="66"/>
brought to passe, all men may reade as much and more▪ as if he should have said to these his scattered people (yet now againe united in Church Covenant) the Lord is now gathering together his Armies, and that your faith may be strengthened, you shall feele and heare the shakings of the Earth by the might of his power: yea, the Sea also, to shew he will ordaine Armies both by Sea and Land to make <HI>Babilon</HI> desolate; Things thus concurring as an immediate answer of the Lord to his peoples prayers and endeavours, caused some of this little handfull with resolute courage and boldnesse to returne againe to their native Land, that they might (the Lord accepting and assisting them in their endeavours) be helpfull in advancing the Kingdome of Christ, and casting down every strong house of sinne and Satan. It matters not indeed who be the instruments, if with the eye of faith these that go forth to fight the Lords Battailes, can but see and heare the Lord going out before them against their enemies, with a sound in the tops of the Mulbery Trees. Here are assu∣redly evident signes that the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> is gone forth for his peoples deliverance, and now Frogs, Flies, Lice or Dust, shall serve to destroy those will yet hold his people in bondage, not∣withstanding the Lord will honour such as hee hath made strong for himselfe; And therefore hee causeth the worthies in <HI>Davids</HI> time to be recorded, and it is the duty of Gods people to in∣courage one another in the worke of the Lord, then let all whose hearts are upright for the Lord, ponder well his goings in his Sanctuary, that their hands may be strengthened in the work they goe about, onely be strong and of a good courage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of the gratious goodnesse of the Lord Christ, in saving his</HI> New-England <HI>people, from the hand of the barbarous</HI> Indians.</HEAD>
<P>LAstly, for the frontispiece of their present distresse, name∣ly the Indian war, they with much meeknesse and great de∣liberation, wisely contrived how they might best helpe their fel∣low brethren; hereupon they resolved to send a solemne Em∣bassage
<PB N="109" REF="66"/>
to old <HI>Cannonicus,</HI> chiefe Sachem of the narrow Ganset <HI>Indians,</HI> who being then well stricken in yeares had caused his Ne∣phew <HI>Miantinemo</HI> to take the Government upon him, who was a very sterne man, and of a great stature, of a cruell nature, cau∣sing all his Nobility and such as were his attendance to tremble at his speech, the people under his Government were very nume∣rous, besides the <HI>Niantick Indians,</HI> whose Prince was of neare aliance unto him; They were able to set forth, as was then sup∣posed 30000. fighting men, the <HI>English</HI> sought by all meanes to keepe these at least from confederating with the <HI>Pequods,</HI> and understanding by intelligence, that the <HI>Pequots</HI> would send to them for that end, endeavoured to prevent them. Fit and able men being chosen by the <HI>English,</HI> they hast them to <HI>Cannonicus</HI> Court, which was about fourescore miles from <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>The Indian King hearing of their comming, gathered toge∣ther his chiefe Counsellors, and a great number of his Subjects to give them entertainment, resolving as then that the young King should receive their message, yet in his hearing, they arriving, were entertain'd royally, with respect to the Indian manner. Boil'd Chesnuts is their White-bread, which are very sweet, as if they were mixt with Sugar; and because they would be extra∣ordinary in their feasting, they strive for variety after the English manner, boyling Puddings made of beaten corne, putting therein great store of black berryes, somewhat like Currants. They ha∣ving thus nobly feasted them, afterward give them Audience, in a State-house, round, about fifty foot wide, made of long poles stuck in the ground, like your Summer-houses in <HI>England,</HI> and covered round about, and on the top with Mats, save a small place in the middle of the Roofe, to give light, and let out the smoke.</P>
<P>In this place sate their <HI>Sachim,</HI> with very great attendance; the English comming to deliver their Message, to manifest the greater state, the Indian <HI>Sachim</HI> lay along upon the ground, on a Mat, and his Nobility sate on the ground, with their legs doubled up, their knees touching their chin: with much sober gravity they attend the Interpreters speech. It was matter of much wonder∣ment to the English, to see how solidly and wisely these savage people did consider of the weighty undertaking of a War; espe∣cially
<PB N="110" REF="67"/>
old <HI>Canonicus,</HI> who was very discreet in his answers. The young Sachem was indeed of a more lofty spirit, which wrought his ruine, as you may heare, after the decease of the old King. But at this time his answer was, that he did willingly embrace peace with the English, considering right well, that although their number was but small in comparison of his people, and that they were but strangers to the Woods, Swamps, and advantagi∣ous places of this Wildernesse, yet withall he knew the English were advantaged by their weapons of War, and especially their Guns, which were of great terror to his people, and also he had heard they came of a more populous Nation by far than all the Indians were, could they be joyn'd together. Also on the other hand, with mature deliberation, he was well advised of the Pea∣quods cruell disposition and aptnesse to make War, as also their neere neighbourhood to his people, who though they were more numerous, yet were they withall more effeminate, and lesse able to defend themselves from the sudden incursions of the <HI>Peaquods,</HI> should they fall out with them. Hereupon hee demes it most conducing to his owne, and his peoples safety to direct his course in a middle way, holding amity with both. The <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> returne home, having gained the old Kings favour so farre, as rather to favour them then the <HI>Pequods,</HI> who perceiving their Neighbouring <HI>English</HI> had sent forth aid to the <HI>Mattacusets</HI> go∣vernment, thought it high time to seeke the winning all the <HI>In∣dians</HI> they could on their side, and among others they make their addresse to old <HI>Cannonicus,</HI> who, insteed of taking part with them, labours all he can to hush the War in hand, laying before them the sad effects of War; sometimes proving sad and mourn∣full to the very Victors themselves, but alwayes to the vanquish∣ed, and withall tells them what potent enemies they had to con∣tend with, whose very weapons and Armor were matter of ter∣ror, setting their persons a side; as also that English man was no much hoggery yet, and therefore they might soone appease them, by delivering into their hands those persons that had beene the death of any of them, which were much better than that the whole Nation should perish.</P>
<P>For the present the <HI>Pequods</HI> seemed to be inclinable to the old <HI>Sachims</HI> counsell, but being returned home againe among their
<PB N="111" REF="67"/>
rude multitude (the chief place of cowardly boasting) they soon change their minde; yet the old <HI>Sachim</HI> sends the <HI>English</HI> word he had wrought with them, and in very deed, the English had rather make choice of Peace then Warre, provided it may stand with Truth and Righteousnesse: and therefore send forth a band of Souldiers, who arriving in the <HI>Peaquod</HI> Country, ad∣dress themselves to have a Treaty with them about delivering up the murtherers; they making shew of willingness so to doe, bade them abide awhile and they would bring them, and in the mean time they were conversant among the Souldiers, and view∣ing their Armie, pointed to divers places where they could hit them with their Arrowes for all their Corslets. But their grea∣test number lying the while at the other side of a great hill, and anon appearing on the top of the hill, in sight of the English: those Indians that were among the English withdrawing to∣ward them; no sooner were they come to their Companions, but all of a suddaine they gave a great shout, and shewed the English a fair pair of heeles, who seeing it, would not availe any thing to follow them (they being farre swifter of foot than the English) made their returne home againe.</P>
<P>This bootlesse voyage incouraged the Indians very much, who insulted over them at the fort, boasting of this their deluding them, and withall, they blasphemed the Lord, saying, English-mans God was all one Flye, and that English man was all one Sqawe, and themselves all one Moor-hawks. Thus by their horrible pride they fitted themselves for destruction. The En∣glish hearing this report, were now full assured that the Lord would deliver them into their hands to execute his righteous judgement upon these blasphemous murtherers; and therefore raised fresh Souldiers for the warre, to the number of fourscore, or thereabout, out of the severall towns in the <HI>Matachusets,</HI> and although they were but in their beginnings, yet the Lord, who fore-intended their work, provided for all their wants, and in∣deed it was much that they had any bisket to carry with them in these times of scarcity, or any vessels to transport their men and ammunition: yet all was provided by the gracious hand of the most high; and the Souldiers, many of them, not onely armed with outward weapons, and armour of defence, but filled with
<PB N="112" REF="68"/>
a spirit of courage and magnanimity to resist, not onely men, but Devils; for surely he was more then ordinaryly present with this Indian army, as the sequell will shew: as also for their further incouragement, the reverend and zealously affected servant of Christ, Mr. <HI>John Wilson,</HI> went with the army, who had treasu∣red up heaps of the experimentall goodnesse of God towards his people. Having formerly passed through perils by Sea, pe∣rils by Land, perils among false brethren, &amp;c. he followed the warre purposely to sound an alarum before the Lord with his silver trumpet, that his people might be remembred before him: the Souldiers ariving in safety at the towne of <HI>Hartford,</HI> where they were encouraged by the reverend Ministers there, with some such speech as followes.</P>
<Q><HI>Fellow-Souldiers, Country-men, and Companions in this wilder∣nesse-worke, who are gathered together this day by the inevitable providence of the great</HI> Jehovah, <HI>not in a tumultuous manner hurri∣ed on by the floating fancy of every high hot headed braine, whose actions prove abortive, or if any fruit brought forth, it hath beene rape, thefe, and murther, things inconsisting with natures light, then much lesse with a Souldiers valour; but you, my deare hearts, pur∣posely pickt out by the godly grave Fathers of this government, that your prowesse may carry on the work, where there Justice in her righteous course is obstructed, you need not question your authority to execute those whom God, the righteous Judge of all the world, hath condemned for blaspheming his sacred Majesty, and murthering his Servants: every common Souldier among you is now installed a Ma∣gistrate; then shew your selves men of courage: I would not draw low the height of your enemies hatred against you, and so debase your valour. This you may expect, their swelling pride hath laid the foun∣dation of large conceptions against you, and all the people of Christ in this mildernesse, even as wide as</HI> Babels <HI>bottome. But, my brave Souldiers, it hath mounted already to the clouds, and therefore it is ripe for confusion; also their crueltie is famously knowne, yet all true-bred Souldiers reserve this as a common maxime, cruelty and cowardize are unseparable companions; and in briefe, there is no∣thing wanting on your enemies part, that may deprive you of a compleat victory, onely their nimbleness of foot, and the unaccessible swamps and nut-tree woods, forth of which your small numbers may</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="68"/>
<HI>intice, and industry compell them. And now to you I put the que∣stion, who would not fight in such a cause with an agile spirit, and un∣daunted boldnesse? yet if you look for further encouragement, I have it for you; riches and honour are the next to a good cause eyed by every Souldier, to maintain your owne, and spoile your enemies of theirs; although gold and silver be wanting to either of you, yet have you that to maintaine which is farre more precious, the lives, liber∣tyes, and new purchased freedomes, priviledges, and immunities of the indeared servants of our Lord Christ Jesus, and of your second selves, even your affectionated bosome mates, together with the thiefe pledges of your love, the comforting contents of harmlesse pra∣tling and smiling babes: and in a word, all the riches of that good∣nesse and mercy that attends the people of God in the injoyment of Christ, in his Ordinances, even in this life; and as for honour,</HI> Da∣vid <HI>was net to be blamed for enquiring after it, as a due recompence of that true valour the Lord had bestowed on him: aad now the Lord hath prepared this honour for you, oh you couragious Souldiers of his, to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and correction among the people, to binde their Kings in chaines, and Nobles in fetters of Iron, that they may execute upon them the judgements that are writ∣ten! this honour shall be to all his Saints, but some of you may sup∣pose deaths stroke may cut you short of this: let every faithfull Soul∣dier of Christ Jesus know, that the cause why some of his indeared Servants are taken away by death in a just warre (as this assuredly is) it is not because they should fall short of the honours accompanying, such noble designes, but rather because earths honours are two scant for them, and therefore the everlasting Crown must be set upon their heads forthwith, then march on with a cheerfull Christian cou∣rage in the strength of the Lord, and the power of his might, who will forthwith inclose your enemies in your hands, make their multi∣tudes fall under your warlike weapons, and your feet shall soon be set on their proud necks.</HI></Q>
<P>After the Ministers of Christ had, through the grace that was given them, exhorted and encouraged these Souldiers appointed for the work, they being provided with certaine Indian guides, who with the close of the day brought them to a small river, where they could perceive many persons had been dressing of fish; upon the sight thereof, the Indian guides concluded they
<PB N="114" REF="69"/>
were now a feasting it at their fort, which was hard at hand; the English calling a Councill of warre, being directed by the speciallest providence of the most high God, they concluded to storm the fort a little before break of day; at whith time they supposed the Indians being up late in their jolly feasting, would bee in their deepest sleepe; and surely so it was, for they now slept their last: the English keeping themselves as covertly as they could, approached the fort at the time appointed, which was builded of whole Trees set in the ground fast, and standing up an end about twelve foot high, very large, having pitcht their Wigwams within it, the entrance being on two sides, with intricate Meanders to enter. The chiefe Leaders of the English made some little stand before they offered to enter, but yet boldly they rushed on, and found the passages guarded at each place with an Indian Bow-man, ready on the string, they soone let fly, and wounded the for▪ most of the English in the shoulder, yet having dispatch'd the Porters, they found the winding way in without a Guide, where they soone placed themselves round the Wigwams, and according to direction they made their first shot with the muz∣zle of their Muskets downe to the ground, knowing the Indian manner is to lie on the ground to sleep, from which they being in this terrible manner awakened, unlesse is were such as were slaine with the shot.</P>
<P>After this some of the <HI>English</HI> entred the Wigwams, where they received some shot with their Arrowes, yet catching up the fire brands, they began to fire them, and others of the English Soulders with powder, did the same: the day now began to break; the Lord intending to have these murtherers know he wou'd looke out of the cloudy pillar upon them: and now these women and children set up a terrible out-cry; the men were smitten down, and flaine, as they came forth with a great slaughter, the <HI>Sqawes</HI> crying out, oh much winn it English-man, who moved with pitty toward them, saved their lives: and hereupon some young youth cryed, I squaw, I squaw, thinking to finde the like mercy. There were some of these In∣dians, as is reported, whose bodyes were not to be pierced by their sharp rapiers of swords of a long time, which made some
<PB N="115" REF="69"/>
of the Souldiers think the Devil was in them, for there were some <HI>Powwowes</HI> among them, which work strange things, with the help of Satan. But this was very remarkable, one of them being wounded to death, and thrust thorow the neck with a halbert; vet after all, lying groaning upon the ground, he caught the halberts speare in his hand, and wound it quite round. After the English were thus possessed of this first victory, they sent their prisoners to the pinnaces, and prosecute the warre in hand, to the next Battalia of the In∣dians, which lay on a hill about two miles distant, and indeed their stoutest Souldiers were at this place, and not yet come to the fort; the English being weary with their night worke, and wanting such refreshing as the present worke required, began to grow faint, yet having obtained one victory, they were very desirous of another: and further, they knew right-well, till this cursed crew were utterly rooted out, they should never be at peace; therefore they marched on toward them. Now assuredly, had the Indians knowne how much weakned our Souldiers were at present, they might have born them downe with their multitude, they being very strong and agile of body, had they come to handy-gripes; but the Lord (who would have his people know their work was his, and he onely must order their Counsels, and war like work for them) did bring them timely supply from the vessels, and also gave them a second victory, wherein they sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew many more of their e∣nemies, the residue flying into a very thick swamp, being unac∣cessible, by reason of the boggy holes of water, and thick bushes; the English drawing up their company beleagered the swamp, and the Indians in the mean time skulking up and down, and as they saw opportunity they made shot with their Arrowes at the English, and then suddainly they would fall flat along in the wa∣ter to defend themselves from the retalliation of the Souldiers Muskets. This lasted not long, for our English being but a small number, had parted themselves far asunder, but by the providence of the most high God, some of them spyed an Indian with a kettle at his back going more inwardly into the swamp, by which they perceived there was some place of firm land in the midst thereof, which caused them to make way for the passage
<PB N="116" REF="70"/>
of their Souldiers, which brought this warre to a period: For al∣though many got away, yet were they no such considerable num∣ber as ever to raise warre any more; the slaine or wounded of the English were (through the mercy of Christ) but a few: One of them being shot through the body, neere about the breast, re∣garding it not till of a long time after, which caused the bloud to dry and thicken on eitheir end of the arrow so that it could not be drawne forth his body without great difficulty and much paine, yet did he scape his life, and the wound healed. Thus the Lord was pleased to assist his people in this warre, and deliver them out of the Indians hands, who were very lusty proper men of their hands, most of them, as may appear by one passage which I shall here relate: thus it came to passe, As the Souldiers were uppon their march, close by a great thicket, where no eye could penetrate farre, as it often falls out in such wearisom wayes, where neither men nor beast have beaten out a path; some Souldiers lingering behinde their fellowes, two Indians watching their opportunity, much like a hungry hauke, when they sup∣posed the last man was come up, who kept a double double double distance in his march, they sudden and swiftly snatched him up in their tallens, hoising him upon their shoulders, ran into the swamp with him; the Souldier unwilling to be made a Pope by being borne on mens shoulders, strove with them all he could to free himselfe from their hands; but, like a carefull Comman∣der, one Captaine <HI>Davenport,</HI> then Lieutenant of this company, being diligent in his place to bring up the reare, coming up with them, followed with speed into the swamp after him, having a very severe cutlace tyed to his wrist, and being well able to make it bite sore when he set it on, resolving to make it fall foul on the Indians bones, he soone overtook them, but was preven∣ted by the buckler they held up from hitting them, which was the man they had taken: It was matter of much wonder to see with what dexterity they hurled the poore Souldier about, as if they had been handling a <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> shield, so that the nimble Captaine <HI>Davenport</HI> could not, of a long time, fasten one stroke upon them; yet, at last, dying their tawny skin into a crimson co∣lour, they cast downe their prey, and hasted thorow the thic∣kets for their lives. The Souldier thus redeemed, had no such
<PB N="117" REF="70"/>
hard usage, but that he is alive, as I suppose, at this very day: The Lord in mercy toward his poore Churches having thus de∣stroyed these bloudy barbarous Indians, he returnes his people in safety to their vessels, where they take account of their priso∣ners: the <HI>Squawes</HI> and some young youths they brought home with them, and finding the men to be deeply guilty of the crimes they undertooke the warre for, they brought away onely their heads as a token of their victory. By this means the Lord strook a trembling terror into all the Indians round about, even to this very day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of the first Syrod holden in</HI> New England, <HI>whereby the Lord in his mercy did more plainly discover his ancient truths, and con∣fute those cursed errors that ordinarily dogg the refor∣ming Churches of CHRIST.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Lord Christ deeming it most expedient for his people to adde some farther help to assist them in cutting downe those cursed errors (that were the next dangerous difficulty they were to meet with) sends in the Reverend and bright shining light Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> and the cheerfull, grave, and gracious Sol∣dier of his, Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> as also Mr. <HI>Thompson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Browne,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fish,</HI> with divers other of the faithfull servants of Christ, the much honoured Mr. <HI>Eaton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hopkins:</HI> and now the time being come, the Synod sate at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where was present about 25. Reverend and godly Ministers of Christ, besides many other gra∣ciously-eminent servants of his. A Catalogue of the severall Er∣rors scattered about the Countrey was there produced, to the number of 80. and liberty given to any man to dispute <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con,</HI> and none to be charged to be of that opinion he disputed for, un∣lesse he should declare himselfe so to be. The Weapons these Souldiers of Christ warred with, was the Sword of the Spirit, e∣ven the Word of God, together with earnest prayer to the God of all Truth, that he would open his truths unto them. The clea∣ring of the true sense and meaning of any place of Scripture, it was done by Scripture, for they so discerned by the grace of God
<PB N="118" REF="71"/>
that was given them, that the whole Scripture must be attended unto. Foure sorts of persons I could with a good will have paid their passage out, and home againe to <HI>England,</HI> that they might have been present at this Synod, so that they would have repor∣ted the truth of all the passages thereof to their own Colledges at their return. The first is the Prelates, who both in Theorie and Practice might have made their owne Eyes Judges in the case, Whether would prevaile most, (to the suppressing of Error, and advancing of Unity in the true worship of God) either their commanding power backt with the subordinate sword of Prin∣ces, or the Word of God cleered up by the faithfull labour and indefatigable pains of the sincere servants of the Lord Christ, and mightily declared through the demonstration of his blessed Spi∣rit. This well waighed, may (through the Lords blessing) stop the yet running fancie in the brains of many, that their Lordly power is the onely means of suppressing Error.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Godly and Reverend Presbyterian Party, who, had they made their eye-witnesses of this worke, they had assu∣redly saved themselves much labour, which I dare presume they would have spent worthily otherwayes, then in writing so many books to prove the Congregationall or Independant Churches to be the sluce, through which so many flouds of Error flow in: nay, my deare and reverend brethren, might not so much work of yours in writing, and ours in answering, have been a meanes to have stopt the height of this overflowing floud? and through the Lords assisting have setled Peace and Truth in a great mea∣sure throughout the three Nations.</P>
<P>Thirdly, those who with their new stratagems have brought in so much old error; for although they had a party here, yet verily they durst not bring their New Light to the Old Word, for fear it would prove but Old Darknesse, (as indeed they doe.) But here might they have seene the Ministers of Christ (who were so experienced in the Scripture, that some of them could tell you the place, both Chapter and Verse, of most sentences of Scripture could be named unto them) with Scriptures light, cleering up the truths of Christ clouded by any of these Errors and Heresies, as had not been done for many Ages before: and verily this great work of Christ must not be lightly over-past, the Author of this
<PB N="119" REF="71"/>
History passeth not for the shrewd censures of men: nor, can it be any matter of disparagement to the reverend and highly ho∣noured in Christ, remaining in <HI>England,</HI> that their fellow bre∣thren have done so worthily here? it is well knowne to all our English Nation, that the most able-preaching Ministers of Christ were most pursued by the lording Clergy, and those that have spent all their dayes, even from a child, in searching the Scri∣ptures, the Lord Christ preparing them by his blessed spirit for this very work. Besides, their continued practice in studying and preaching the wayes of truth; and lastly, their meeting with the opposition of so many crafty, close couched errors, whose first foundation was laid cheke by joule with the most glorious, heavenly, and blessed truths, to dazle the eyes of the beholders, and strike terrour into the hearts of those should lift up their hands against them, for feare they should misse them, and hit their stroke upon the blessed truth; and also to bring up a slan∣derous and evil report on all the able Orthodox Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of Christ that withstand them, perswading men they withstand the holy, heavenly, and blessed truth, which they have lodged there, which this Synod did with strong &amp; undenyable arguments fetch from Scripture, to overthrow and pluck up by the roots, all those Errors, which you have heard mentioned in the former Book, the which they divided for the more full answering of them. A∣mong all those valiant Champions of the Truth whom you have heard named, to some six, some five, some foure, &amp;c. it had assu∣redly been worth the work to have related the particular man∣ner of putting to the sword every one of them: but besides the length of the discourse, there must have been a more able Pen∣man: but however they were so put to death, that they never have stood up in a living manner among us since, but sometimes like Wizards to peepe and mutter out of ground, fit for such people to resort unto, as will goe from the living to the dead. But blessed be the Lord Christ, who girded his people with strength against this day of battaile, and caused the Heavens to cleere up againe in New-England, after these foggy dayes:</P>
<P>The fourth and last sort of persons, whose presence I could most of all the other three former have desired, was those whose disease lay as chiefly in despising all Physitians, and that upon this

ground for one, because some for filthy lucre sake have nourish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Diseases rather then cured them. Many pamphlets have come from our Countreymen of late, to this purpose, namely, scurril∣lously to deride all kind of Scholarship, Presbytery, and Synods. Experience hath taught Gods people here, that such are troubled with some sinfull opinion of their owne, that they would not have touched; but had they been at this Synod, they must, <HI>per force,</HI> have learned better language, or their speech and their knowledge would fall foule one of the other; here might they have beheld the humility of the most learned of these servants of Christ, condemning the high conceitednesse of their ignorance, and then also the framing of Arguments in a Schollar like way, did (the Lord assisting) cleare up the truths of Christ more to the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nest capacity in one hour, then could be clouded again in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aven yeare by the new notion of any such as boast so much of their unlettered knowledge, diversity of languages, although a correcting hand of God upon the whole world, when they joyned together in that proud Edifice: yet now is it blest of God, to retaine the purity of the Scriptures; if any man should goe about to corrupt them in one language, they should remain pure in another; and assuredly, the Lord intending to have the wayes of the Gospel of Christ to be made more manifest at this time, then formerly, not by tradition of our forefathers, or by mans reason, but by the revealed will of God in the holy Scri∣pture, did accordingly prepare Instruments for this work, earthen vessels, men subject to like infirmities with our selves; sorry men, and carrying about with them a body of sinne and death, men subject to erre: yet these did the Lord Christ cause to be train'd up in Learning, and tutor'd at the Universities, and that very young, some of them, as the revererend Mr. <HI>John Cotten</HI> at 13. yeares of age. The mighty power of God sanctifyed and ordained them for this work, and made them a defenced city, an iron pillar, a wall of brass against all the opposers of his truth; and now coupled them together in this Synod, to draw in Christs yoke, and warre with the weapons he had furnished them withall, and cause the blessed truths of Christ to shine forth in their splendour and glory, farre more after the dispersing of this smoak, which of a long time hath filled the Temple, and hinde∣red
<PB N="121" REF="72"/>
the entring in of those great number of Converts, which shall flow in at the fall of all antichristian Errors; and verily as the Lord Christ had called forth this little handfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to be a model of his glorious work, intended thoughout the whole world, so chiefly in this suppressing of Errours, Sects, and Heresies, by the blessed word of his truth, causing his servants in this Synod, mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ally to agree; and by his gracious providence, break in pieces a contrived plot of some, who, by mis-reports, insinuating jealousies, and crafty carriage of matters to the wrong mark, with a writing of thrice twenty strong, would have drawne away one of the valiant Souldiers of Christ from this worthy worke, who both then, and since, hath been very helpfull to cast downe many a strong fort erected by the Sectaries; but the Lord Christ would not suffer this blow to be given, intending all people (by way of restitution) for their slanderous reports, cast upon his <HI>New England</HI> Churches (as being the inlet to Errours) shall honour them with this victorious co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quest, given them by Christ herein; yet willing they would, their brethren in <HI>England</HI> might win the prize by out-stripping them, more abundantly in length, bredth and height, which the same God is able to per∣forme, that hath been thus abundantly good to us.</P>
<P>About this time the Churches of Christ began to be diligent in their duty, and the civil government in looking after such as were like to disturb the peace of this new erected govern∣ment; some persons being so hot headed for maintaining of these sinfull opinions, that they feared breach of peace, even among the Members of the superiour Court, but the Lord bles∣sing them with agreement to prevent the wofull effects of civill broyles; those in place of government caused certain persons to be disarmed in the severall Townes, as in the Towne of <HI>Boston,</HI> to the number of 58. in the Towne of <HI>Salem</HI> 6. in the Towne of <HI>Newbery</HI> 3. in the Towne of <HI>Roxbury</HI> 5. in the Towne of <HI>Ipswitch</HI> 2. and <HI>Charles</HI> Towne 2. others there were, that through the help of the faithfull servants of Christ, came to see how they had beene m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sled, and by the power of Christ in his Word, returned againe with an acknowledge∣ment of their sinne; but others there were, who remained obstinate, to the disturbing of the civill power, and were bani∣shed,
<PB N="122" REF="73"/>
of whom you shall heare farther hereafter. Some of the Churches of Christ being more indulgent, waited long ere they fell upon the work: and here you must tak notice, that the Sy∣nod, Civil Government, and the Churches of Christ, kept their proper place, each moving in their own sphear, and acting by their own light, or rather by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wit∣nessed by his Word and Spirit, yet not refusing the help of eacg other (as some would willingly have it) some of the Churches prosecuting the Rule of Christ against their hereticall Members, were forced to proceed to excommunication of them, who when they saw whereto it would come, they would have pre∣vented it with lying, but the Lord discovered it; and so they were justly separated from the Churches of Christ for lying: which being done, they fell to their old trade againe.</P>

<P>THe Lord Christ having now in his great mercy taken out of the way these mountains that seemed in the eye of Man to block up his Churches further proceedings, they had now leisure to welcome the living stones that the Lord was pleased to adde unto this building, and with thankfull acknowledgment to give him of his owne for his mercyes multitude, whose was the work in planting, not onely more Churches, but another Colo∣ny also; for the honoured Mr, <HI>Eaton</HI> being accompanied with many worthy persons of note, whom the Lord had furnished with store of substance for this wildernesse-work, although they would willingly have made their abode under the government of the Mattachusets; yet could they finde no place upon the Sea-coasts for their settling: the Lord intending to enlarge his peo∣ples border, caused them, after much search, to take up a place somewhat more southwardly, neare the shalles of <HI>Cape-cod,</HI> where they had very flatt water; yet being entred in, they found: commodious harbour for shipping, and a fit place to erect a

Here did these godly and sincere servants of Christ, according to the rule of the Word, gather into Church Estate, and called to the office of a Pastor the reverend, judicious, and godly Mr, <HI>John Davenport,</HI> of whom the Author is bold to say as fol∣loweth:</P>

<P>This Church and Town soon procur'd some Sisters to take part with her, and among them they erected a godly and peaceable Government, and called their frontier towne <HI>New haven,</HI> of which the Government is denominated, being inhabited by many men eminent in gifts for the populating thereof, and managing of affaires both by Sea and Land; they have had some shipping

This Towne was first founded by some persons that were not so forward to promote the Ordinances of Christ, as many others have been: they desired the reverend Minister of Christ Mr. <HI>Gennors,</HI> to be helpfull in preaching the Word un∣to them; who after some little space of time, not liking the place, repaired to the Eastern English: but the people of this place, after his departure, being gathered into a Church, they called to office the reverend and godly Mr <HI>Newman;</HI> but many of them unwilling to continue in this Towne, as supposing they had found a fitter place for habitation, removed into the next Government, carrying with them their Pastor; by which means, the people that were left behinde, were now destitute, and ha∣ving some godly Christians among them, who much desired the sincere milk of the Word that they might grow thereby: upon diligent use of meanes they found out a young man able gifted for the work, brought up with the reverend and judicious Mr. <HI>Chancie,</HI> called Mr. <HI>Thomas Thatcher.</HI> Yet againe, after some few yeares, for want of sufficient maintenance, with mutuall consent they parted with him, and are forced to borrow help of their Neighbours, wherein all of them to the Author is bold to say as followeth:</P>

The peace of this little Com∣mon-wealth being now in great measure settled, by the Lords mercy, in overthrowing the Indians, and banishing of certaine turbulent spirits. The Churches of Christ were much edified in their holy faith by their indefatigable pains of their Ministers, in their weekly Lectures extraordinary as well as by their Sabboth-Assemblies, and continuall visiting of their people from house to house, endeavouring to heale the hurts these false de∣ceivers had made, with double diligence showring downe the sweet dews of the blessed Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the conver∣ting of many a poor soul. and indeed, now were the glorious days of <HI>New England;</HI> the Churches of Christ increase dayly, and his eminent Embassadours resort unto them from our native Coun∣try, which as then lay under the tyranny of the Monarchall Arch-prelates, which caused the servants of Christ to wander from their home.

<P>THis yeare, the first day of the Fourth Month, about two of the clock in the after-noone, the Lord caus'd a great and terrible Earth quake, which was generall throughout all the English Plantations; the motion of the Earth was such, that it caused divers men (that had never knowne an Earth quake be∣fore) being at worke in the Fields, to cast downe their working-tooles, and run with gastly terrified lookes, to the next com∣pany they could meet withall; it came from the Westerne and uninhabited parts of this Wildernesse, and went the direct course: this brood of Travellers came, the Ministers of Christ many of them could say at that very time (not from any other Revelation, but what the word holds forth) that if the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> were Gods house, then suddenly there would follow great alterations in the Kingdomes of Europe.</P>
<P>This yeare the civill government proceeded to censure the re∣sidue of thofe sinfull erroneous persons, who raised much com∣motion
<PB N="132" REF="78"/>
in this little Common-wealth; who being banished, resorted to a place more Southward, some of them sitting down at a place called Providence, others betooke them to an Island about 16. miles distant from the former, called <HI>Rode</HI> Island, where having Elbow roome enough, none of the Ministers of Christ, nor any other to interrupt their false and deceivable Do∣ctrines, they hamper'd themselves fouly with their owne line, and soone shewed the depthlesse ditches that blinde guides lead into; many among them being much to be pittyed, who were drawne from the truth by the bewitching tongues of some of them being, very ignorant and easily perverted: and al∣though the people were not many in all, yet were they very di∣verse in their opinions, and glad where they could gaine most Disciples to heare them; some were for every day to be a Sab∣bath, and therefore kept not any Sabbath-day at all; others were some for one thing, some for another; and therefore had their severall meetings, making many a goodly piece of Preachment; among whom there were some of the female sexe (who deeming the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to be too strict in not permitting a roome to preach in the publique Congregation) taught, notwithstan∣ding they having their call to this office, from an ardent desire of being famous, especially the grand Mistresse of them all, who ordinarily prated every Sabbath day, till others, who thirsted af∣ter honour in the same way with her selfe, drew away her Au∣ditors, and then she withdrew her self, her husband, and her fa∣mily also, to a more remote place; and assuredly, although the Lord be secret in all the dispensation of his providences, whether in judgement or mercy, yet much may be learn'd from all, as sometimes pointing with the finger to the lesson; as here these persons withdrawing from the Churches of Christ (wherein he walketh, and is to be found in his blessed Ordinances) to a first and second place, where they came to a very sad end; for thus it came to passe in the latter place, The Indians in those parts for∣warned them of making their abode there; yet this could be no warning to them, but still they continued, being amongst a mul∣titude of Indians, boasted they were become all one Indian: and indeed, this woman, who had the chiefe rule of all the roast, be∣ing very bold in her strange Revelations and mis-applications,

tells them, though all nations and people were cut off round a∣bout them, yet should not they; till on a day certaine Indians coming to her house, discoursing with them, they wished to tye up her doggs, for they much bit the man, not mistrusting the Indians guile, did so; the which no sooner done, but they cruelly murthered her, taking one of their daughters away with them, &amp; another of them seeking to escape is caught, as she was getting over a hadge, and they drew her back againe by the haire of the head to the stump of a tree, and there cut off her head with a hatchet; the other that dwelt by them betook them to boat, and fled, to tell this sad newes; the rest of their companions, who were rather hardened in their sinfull way, and blasphemous opinions, than brought to any sight of their damnable Errours, as you shall after hear; yet was not this the first loud speaking hand of God against them; but before this the Lord had poyn∣ted directly to their sinne by a very fearfull Monster, that ano∣ther of these women brought forth, they striving to bury it in oblivion, but the Lord brought it to light, setting forth the view of their monstrous Errors in this prodigious birth. This yeare, although the estates of these pilgrim people were much wasted, yet seeing the benefit that would accrew to the Churches of Christ and Civil Government, by the Lords blessing, upon lear∣ning, they began to erect a Colledge, the Lord by his provident hand giving his approbation to the work, in sending over a faithfull and godly servant of his, the reverend Mr <HI>John Harverd,</HI> who joyning with the people of Christ at <HI>Charles Towne,</HI> sud∣dainly after departed this life, and gave near a thousand pound toward this work; wherefore the Government thought it meet to call it <HI>Harverd</HI> Colledge in remembrance of him.</P>

<P>This yeare the Town and Church of Christ at <HI>Sudbury</HI> began to have the first foundation stones laid, taking up her station in the Inland Country, as her elder Sister Concord had formerly done, lying farther up the same River, being furnished with great plenty of fresh marsh, but it lying very low is much indamma∣ged with land-flouds, insomuch that when the summer proves wet, they lose part of their hay; yet are they so sufficiently pro∣vided, that they take in Cattell of other Townes to winter: these people not neglecting the chief work, for the which they entred this wildernesse, namely, to worship the Lord in the purity of his Ordinances, and according to the rule of his Word, entred into covenant with him, and one with another professedly to walk together in Church-fellowship; and according to the

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. <HI>Of the first promation of learning in</HI> New-England, <HI>and the ex∣traordinary providences that the Lord was pleased to send for furthering of the same.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TOward the latter end of this Summer came over the learned, reverend, and judicious Mr. <HI>Henry Dunster,</HI> be∣fore whose coming the Lord was pleased to provide a Patron for erecting a Colledg, as you have formerly heard, his pro∣vident hand being now no less powerful in pointing out with his unerring finger, a president abundantly fitted this his ser∣vant, and sent him over for to mannage the work; and as in all the other passages of this history, the Wonder-working Providence of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns</HI> Saviour hath appeared, so more especial∣ly in this work, the Fountains of learning being in a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> measure stopped in our Native Country at this time, so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sweet waters of <HI>Shilo's</HI> streams must ordinarily pass into

the Churches through the stinking channel of prelatical pride, beside all the filth that the fountains themselves were daily incumbred withall, insomuch that the Lord turned aside of∣ten from them, and refused the breathings of his blessed Spi∣rit among them, which caused Satan (in these latter daies of his transformation into an Angel of light) to make it a means to perswade people from the use of learning altogether, that so in the next generation they might be destitute of such helps, as the Lord hath been pleased hitherto to make use of, as chief means for the conversion of his people, and building them up in the holy faith, as also for breaking downe the Kingdom of Antichrist; and verily had not the Lord been pleased to furnish <HI>N. E.</HI> with means for the attainment of learning, the work would have been carried on very heavily, and the hearts of godly parents would have vanish'd away with heaviness for their poor children, whom they must have left in a desolare wilderness, destitute of the meanes of grace.</P>
<P>It being a work (in the apprehension of all, whose capaci∣ty could reach to the great sums of money, the edifice of a mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olledg would cost) past the reach of a poor Pilgrim people, who had expended the greatest part of their estates on a long voyage, travelling into Forraign Countryes, being unprofitable to any that have undertaken it, although it were but with their necessary attendance, whereas this people were forced to travel with wifes, children, and servants; be∣sides they considered the troble charge of building in this new populated desart, in regard of al kind of workmanship, know∣ing likewise, that young Students could make but a poor progress in learning, by looking on the bare walls of their chambers, and that <HI>Diogenes</HI> would have the better of them by far, in making use of a Tun to lodg in, not being ignorant also, that many people in this age are out of conceit with learning, and that although they were not among a people who counted ignorance the mother of devotion, yet were the greater part of the people wholly devoted to the Plow, (but to speak uprightly, hunger is sharp, and the head will retain little learning, if the heart be not refreshed

in some competent measure with food, although the gross va∣pors of a glutted stomack are the bane of a bright under∣standing, and brings barrenness to the brain) but how to have both go on together, as yet they know not; amidst all these difficulties, it was thought meet learning should plead for it self, and (as many other men of good rank and quality in this barren desart) plod out a way to live: Hereupon all those who had tasted the sweet wine of Wisdoms drawing, and fed on the dainties of knowledg, began to set their wits a work, and verily as the whole progress of this work had a farther dependency then on the present eyed means, so at this time chiefly the end being firmly fixed on a sure foundation, name∣ly, the glory of God, and good of all his elect people, the world throughout, in vindicating the truths of Christ, and promoting his glorious Kingdom, who is now taking the hea∣then for his inheritance, and the utmost ends of the earth for his possession, means they know there are, many thousands uneyed of mortal man, which every daies Providence brings forth; upon these resolutions, to work they go, and with thankful acknowledgment, readily take up all lawful means as they come to hand, for place they fix their eye upon <HI>New-Town,</HI> which to tell their Posterity whence they came, is now named <HI>Cambridg,</HI> and withal to make the whole world un∣derstand, that spiritual learning was the thing they chiefly desired, to sanctifie the other, and make the whole lump ho∣ly, and that learning being set upon its right object, might not contend for error instead of truth; they chose this place, being then under the Orthodox, and soul-flourishing Ministe∣ry of Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepheard,</HI> of whom it may be said, with∣out any wrong to others, the Lord by his Ministery hath sa∣ved many a hundred soul: The scituation of this Colledg is very pleasant, at the end of a spacious plain, more like a bow∣ling green, then a Wilderness, neer a fair navigable river, envi∣roned with many Neighbouring Towns of note, being so neer, that their houses joyn with her Suburbs, the building thought by some to be too gorgeous for a Wilderness, and yet too mean in others apprehensions for a Colledg, it is at pre∣sent in larging by purchase of the neighbour houses, it hath

<P>About this time the people inhabiting the Town of <HI>Do∣ver,</HI> although they lay out of any of these Colonies men∣tioned, (yet hearing and seeing with what sweet harmony, both in Churches and civil Government, the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> peopled patten was carried on prosperonsly) desired greatly to submit unto the same, by putting themselves under their protection; and for that end they petitioned their General <HI>Cort</HI> to admit of them, and administer Justice as occasion ser∣ved, by the hands of their godly Magistrates, which accord∣ingly was granted, and they have been partakers of the bene∣fit hitherto, having also the benefit of some one Minister to preach unto them, till it pleased God to fit stones by the continual hewing of his word for his Temple-work, and they gather a Church according to the rule of the word, and call∣ed to office of a Pastor one M. <HI>Maude,</HI> both godly, both god∣ly and diligent in the work: This Town is scituate upon <HI>Pus∣cataque</HI> river, lying to the Northeast of <HI>Boston,</HI> which river although it be not nigh so broad as <HI>Merrinaeck</HI> river, yet i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it navigable, being very deep, and her banks in many place fil'd with stately timber, which hath caused one or two Saw Mills to be continued; there they have a good quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Meddow Land, and good ground for <HI>India</HI> corn.

the Winter and Summer proving more moderate, both for heat and cold, unmasking many by this means, it being a frequent thing with some, that after the novelties of a new la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d began to be stale with them, and the sweet nourish∣ment of the soul by the presence of Christ in the preaching of his Word, began to dry up through the hot heady conceit of some new conceived opinion: Then they wanted a warmer country, and every Northwest wind that blew, they crept in∣to some odd chimney-corner or other, to discourse of the di∣versity of Climates in the Southerne parts, but chiefly of a thing very sweet to the pallate of the flesh, called liberty, which they supposed might be very easily attain'd, could they but once come into a place where all men were chosen to the office of a Magistrate, and all were preachers of the Word, and no hearers, then it would be all Summer and no Winter: This consultation was to be put in practise speedily, as all headstrong motions are, but the issue proved very sad, both to these and others also; for thus it befell, when the time of the year was come that a sea-voyage might be under∣taken, they having made sale of a better accommodation then any they could afterward attain unto, prepare for the voyage with their wifes and children, intending to land them in one of the Summer Islands, called the Isle of Providence, and ha∣ving wind and seas favouring them, as they supposed, or to speak more proper, the provident hand of the most high God directing it, they were brought so neer the shore for conve∣nient landing, that they might have heaved a Bisket cake on land; their Pilate wondring he could not see the English co∣lours on the Fort, he began to mistrust the Island was taken, and more especially, because they saw not the people appear upon the shores as they usually did when any Vessel was a coming in, but now and then they saw some people a far off wasting to them to come in, till they were even come to an Anchor, and then by the hoising up and down the heads of those on shore, they were fully confirmed in it, that the Island was taken, as indeed it was by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who as soone as they tackt about to be gone, made shot at them, and being in great fear they made all the fail they could, but before they could get out of shot, the Master of the Vessel was slain, the

main sail shot through, and the Barque also; the people some of them returned back again for <HI>New-England,</HI> being sore a∣bashed at this providence that befel them, that they would never seek to be governed by liberty again to this very day; yet others there are were so strongly bent for the heat of li∣berty, that they indured much pinching penury upon an un∣inhabited Island, til at length meeting some others like-mind∣ed with themselves, they made a voyage to another Island, the chiefest part of their Charter of Freedom was this, That no man upon pain of death should speak against anothers Reli∣gion where they continued, till some of them were famished, and others even forced to feed on Rats, and any other thing they could find to sustain nature, till the provident hand of God brought a Ship to the place, which took them off the I∣sland, and saved their lives: But upon this the Winters dis∣course ceased, and projects for a warmer Country were husht and done.</P>

<P>FOr this year 1642. <HI>Iohn Winthrope</HI> Esquire was chosen Go∣vernour, and <HI>John Endicut</HI> Esquire Deputy Governor: The number of Freemen added were about 1232. This Spring Cowes and Cattle of that kind (having continued at an ex∣cessive price so long as any came over with estates to purchase them) fell of a suddain in one week from 22 l. the Cow, to 6.7. or 8. l. the cow at most, insomuch that it made all men admire how it came to pass, it being the common practise of those that had any store of Cattel, to sell every year a Cow or two, which cloath'd their backs, fil'd their bellies with more varieties then the Country of it self afforded, and put gold and silver in their purses beside. Here the Reader it desired to take notice of the wonderful providence of the most high God toward these his new-planted Churches, such as was never heard of, since that <HI>Iacobs</HI> sons ceased to be a

people, that in ten or twelve years planting, there should be such wonderful alteration, a Nation to be born in a day, a Commonwealth orderly brought forth from a few Fugi∣tives, all the Forraign plantations that are of forty, fifty, or a hundred years standing, cannot really report the like, al∣though they have had the greatest incouragements earth could afford, Kings to countenance them, staple commodities to provoke all manner of Merchants to resort unto them, silver, gold, precious stones, or whatever might incice the eye or ear to incline the motion of man toward them, his remove, rocky, barren, bushy, wild-woody wilderness, a receptacle for Lions, Wolves, Bears, Foxes, Rockoones, Bags, Bevers, Otters, and all kind of wild creatures, a place that never afforded the Natives better then the flesh of a few wild creatures and parch't Indian corn incht out with Chesnuts and bitter Acorns, now through the mercy of Christ becom a second <HI>England</HI> for fertilness in so short a space, that it is indeed the wonder of the world; but bring already forgotten of the very persons that tast of it at present, although some there be that keep in memory his mercies multitude, and declare it to their childrens children.</P>
<P>First to begin with the encrease of food, you have heard in what extream penury these people were in at first, planting for want of food, gold, silver, rayment, or whatsoever was precious in their eyes they parted with (when ships came in) for this their beast that died, some would stick before they were cold, and sell their poor pined flesh for food, at 6.d. <HI>per</HI> pound, Indian Beans at 16.s. <HI>per</HI> bushel, when Ships came in it grieved some Master to see the urging of them by people of good rank and quality to sell bread unto them. But now take notice how the right hand of the most high hath altered all, and men of the meaner rank are urging them to buy bread of them, and now good white and wheaten bread is no dainty, but even ordinary man hath his choice, if gay cloathing, and a liquerish tooth after sack, sugar and plums lick not away his bread too fast, all which are but ordinary among those that were not able to bring their owne persons ever at their first coming; there are not many Towns in the Country, but the poorest person in them hath a house and land of his own,
<PB N="174" REF="90"/>
and bread of his own growing, if not some cattel: beside, flesh is now no rare food, beef, pork, and mutton being frequent in many houses, so that this poor Wilderness hath not onely equalized <HI>England</HI> in food, but goes beyond it in some places for the great plenty of wine and sugar, which is ordinarily spent, apples, pears, and quince tarts instead of their former Pumpkin Pies, Poultry they have plenty, and great rarity, and in their feasts have not forgotten the English fashion of stir∣ing up their appetites with variety of cooking their food; and notwithstanding all this great and almost miraculous work of the Lord, in providing for his people in this barren desart, yet are there here (as in other places) some that use these good creatures of God to excess, and others to hoard up in a wretched and miserable manner, pinch themselves and their children with food, and will not tast of the good crea∣tures God hath given for that end, but cut Church and Com∣monwealth as short also: Let not such think to escape the Lords hand with as little a stroke, as the like do in other pla∣ces.</P>
<P>Secondly, For rayment, our cloth hath not been cut short, as but of late years the traders that way have encreased to such a number, that their shops have continued full all the year long, all one <HI>England;</HI> besides the Lord hath been plea∣sed to encrease sheep extraordinarily of late, hemp and flax here is great plenty, hides here are more for the number of persons then in <HI>England;</HI> and for cloth, here is and would be materials enough to make it; but the Farmers deem it better for their profit to put away their cattel and corn for cloath∣ing, then to set upon making of cloth; if the Merchants trade be not kept on foot, they fear greatly their corne and cattel will lye in their hands; assuredly the plenty of cloath∣ing hath caused much excess of late in those persons, who have clambered with excess in wages for their work, but see∣ing it will be the theam of our next discourse, after the birds are setled, it may be here omitted.</P>
<P>Further, the Lord hath been pleased to turn all the wig∣wams, huts, and hovels the English dwelt in at their first com∣ing, into orderly, fair, and well-built houses, well furnished

many of them, together with Orehards filled with goodly fruit trees, and gardens with variety of flowers: There are supposed to be in the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> Government at this day, neer a thousand acres of land planted for Orchards and Gar∣dens, besides their fields are filled with garden fruit, there be∣ing, as is supposed in this Colony, about fifteen thousand a∣cres in tillage, and of cartel about twelve thousand neat, and about three thousand sheep: Thus hath the Lord in couraged his people with the encrease of the general, although many particulars are outed, hundreds of pounds, and some thou∣sands, yet are there many hundreds of labouring men, who had not enough to bring them over, yet now worth scores, and some hundreds of pounds; to be sure the Lord takes no∣tice of all his talents, and will call to accompt in time: This brief survey of things will be of good use when time serves, in mean time you shall understand,</P>

<P>THere was a Town and Church erected called <HI>Wooburn,</HI> this present year, but because all the action of this wan∣dering people meet with great variety of censures, the Author will in this Town and Church see down the manner how this people have populated their Towns, and gathered their Chur∣ches, that the reverend Mr. <HI>Rathbone</HI> may be better informed, then when he wrote his book concerning the Churches of <HI>N.

<PB N="176" REF="91"/>
take shame to themselves, wherein they have miscar∣ried: But to begin, this Town, as all others had its bounds fixed by the General Court, to the contenese of four miles squa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, (beginning at the end of <HI>Charles Town</HI> bounds) the grant is to seven men or good and honest report, upon con∣dition, that within two year they erect houses for habitation thereon, and so go on to make a Town thereof, upon the Act of Court; these seven men have power to give and grant out lands unto any persons who are willing to take up their dwellings within the said precinct, &amp; to be admitted to al com∣mon priviledges of the said Town, giving them such an am∣ple portion, both of Medow and Upland, as their present and future stock of cattel and hands were like to improve, with eye had to others that might after come to populate the said Town; this they did without any respect of persons, yet such as were exorbitant, and of a turbulent spirit, unfit for a civil society they would reject, till they come to mend their man∣ners, such came not to enjoy any freehold: These seven men ordered and disposed of the streets of the Town, as might be best for improvement of the Land, and yet civil and religious society maintained; to which end those that had land neerest the place for Sabbath assembly, had a lesser quantity at home, and more farther off to improve for corn, of all kinds; they refused not men for their poverty, but according to their a∣bility were helpful to the poorest sort, in building their houses, and distributed to them land accordingly; the poorest had six or seven acres of Medow, and twenty five of Upland, or thereabouts: Thus was this Town populated, to the num∣ber of sixty families, or thereabout, and after this manner are the Towns of <HI>New England</HI> peopled, the scituation of this Town is in the highest part of the yet peopled land, neere upon the head-springs of many considerable rivers, or their branches, as the first rise of <HI>Ipswitch</HI> river, and the rise of <HI>Sha∣shin</HI> river, one of the most considerable branches of <HI>Merri∣meck,</HI> as also the first rise of <HI>Mistick</HI> river and ponds, it is very full of pleasant springs, and great variety of very good water, which the Summers heat causeth to be more cooler, and the Winters cold maketh more warmer; their Medows
<PB N="177" REF="91"/>
are not large, but lye in divers places to particular dwellings, the like doth their Springs; their Land is very fruitful in ma∣ny places, although they have no great quantity of plain land in any one place, yet doth their Rocks and Swamps yeeld ve∣ry good food for cattel; as also they have Mast and Tar for shipping, but the distance of place by land causeth them as yet to be unprofitable, they have great store of iron o're, their meeting-house stands in a small Plain, where four streets meet, the people are very labotious, if not exceeding some of them.</P>
<P>Now to declare how this people proceeded in religious mat∣ters, and so consequently all the Churches of Christ planted in <HI>New-England,</HI> when they came once to hopes of being such a competent number of people, as might be able to maintain a Minister, they then surely seated themselves, and not before, it being as unnatural for a right <HI>N. E.</HI> man to live without an able Ministery, as for a Smith to work his iron without a fire; therefore this people that went about placing down a Town, began the foundation-stone, with earnest seeking of the Lords assistance, by humbling of their souls before him in daies of prayer, and imploring his aid in so weighty a work, then they address themselves to attend counsel of the most Orthodox and ablest Christians, and more especially of such as the Lord had already placed in the Ministery, not rashly running together themselves into a Church, before they had hopes of attaining an Officer to preach the Word, and admi∣nister the Seals unto them, chosing rather to continue in fel∣lowship with some other Church for their Christian watch over them, till the Lord would be pleased to provide: They after some search meet with a young man named Mr. <HI>Thomas Carter,</HI> then belonging to the Church of Christ at <HI>VVater-Town,</HI> a reverend godly man, apt to teach the sound and wholesome truths of Christ; having attained their desires, in hopes of his coming unto them, were they once joyned in Church-estate, he exercising his gifts of preaching and prayer among them in the mean time, and more especially in a day of fasting and prayer. Thus these godly people interest their affections one with the other, both Minister and people: Af∣ter

this they make ready for the work, and the 24. of the 6. moneth 1642. they assemble together in the morning about eight of the clock; After the reverend Mr. <HI>Syms</HI> had conti∣nued in preaching and prayer about the space of four or five houres, the persons that were to joyn in Covenant, openly and professedly before the Congregation, and messengers of divers Neighbour Churches, among whom the reverend El∣der of <HI>Boston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Mr. <HI>VVilson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shepheard</HI> of <HI>Cambridg,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dunster</HI> of <HI>VVater-Town,</HI> Mr. <HI>Knowles</HI> of <HI>Deadham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mr. <HI>E∣liot</HI> of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mather:</HI> As also it is the duty of the Magistrates (in regard of the good and peace of the civil Go∣vernment) to be present, at least some one of them (not on∣ly to prevent the disturbance might follow in the Common∣wealth by any, who under pretence of Church-Covenant, might bring in again those cursed opinions that caused such commotion in this and the other Colony, to the great dam∣mage of the people) but also to countenance the people of God in so pious a work, that under them they may live a qui∣et and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty; for this cause was present the honored Mr. <HI>Increase Nowel,</HI> the persons stood forth, and first confessed what the Lord had done for their poor souls, by the work of his Spirit in the preaching of his Word, and Providences, one by one; (and that all might know their faith in Christ was bottomed upon him, as he is revealed in his Word, and that from their own knowledg) they also declare the same, according to that measure of un∣derstanding the Lord had given them; the Elders, or any o∣ther messengers there present question with them, for the bet∣ter understanding of them in any points they doubt of, which being done, and all satisfied, they in the name of the Churches to which they do belong, hold out the right hand of fellow∣ship unto them, they declaring their Covenant, in words ex∣pressed in writing to this purpose.</P>

Priest, being desired of the Church, continued in prayer un∣to the Lord for his more especial assistance of this his servant in his work, being a charge of such weighty importance, as is the glory of God and salvation of souls, that the very thought would make a man to tremble in the sense of his own inability to the work: The people having provided a dwelling house, built at the charge of the Town in general, welcomed him unto them with joy, that the Lord was pleased to give them such a blessing, that their eyes may see their Teachers: Af∣ter this there were divers added to the Church daily; after this manner the person desirous to joyn with the Church, cometh to the Pastor, and makes him acquainted therewith, declaring how the Lord hath been pleased to work his con∣version, who discerning hopes of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsons faith in Christ, although weak, yet if any appear, he is propounded to the Church in general for their approbation, touching his godly life and conversation, and then by the Pastor and some bre∣thren heard again, who make report to the Church of their charitable approving of the person; but before they come to joyn with the Church, all persons within the Towne have publike notice of it, then publikely he declares the manner of his conversion, and how the Lord hath been pleased by the hearing of his Word preached, and the work of his Spirit in the inward parts of his soul, to bring him out of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tural darkness, which all men are by nature in and under, as also the measure of knowledg the Lord hath been pleased to indue him withal. And because some men cannot speak pub∣likely to edisication through bashfulness, the less is required of such, and women speak not publikely at all, for all that is desired, is to prevent the polluting the blessed Ordinances of Christ by such as walk scandalously, and that men and women do not eat and drink their own condemnation, in not discern∣ing the Lords body. After this manner were many added to this Church of Christ, and those 7. that joyned in Church-fel∣lowship at first, are now encreased to 74. persons, or therabout; of which, according to their own confession, as is supposed, the greater part having been converted by the preaching of the Word in <HI>N.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. <HI>Of the uniting of the four English Colonies in N, E. and the bat∣tel fought between the</HI> Narragansets, <HI>and</HI> Mawhiggins.</HEAD>
<P>THe yeare 1653. the honored <HI>John Winthrop</HI> Esquire was chosen Governor again, and <HI>John Endicut</HI> Esquire Depu∣ty Governour; the free men added were about 87. this year, the four Colonies, the <HI>Mattachusets, Plimoth, Canectico,</HI> and <HI>New-haven,</HI> taking into consideration the many Nations of <HI>Dutch, Zewes,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> that were on either side of them; as also how apt they were to lay claim to lands they never had any right unto, but only a paper possession of their own framing; and further, that the inhumane and barbarous In∣dians would be continually quarrelling and contending, could they see any hopes of prevailing, together with the conte∣stion begun in our Native country, and withal, that although providence had cast them into four several Colonies, yet Re∣ligion had already united them, coming over all for one and the same end. Hereupon by Commissioners sent from the se∣veral colonies, they concluded a firm confederation to assist each other in all just and lawful war, bearing an equal pro∣portion in the charge, according to the number of persons inhabiting each colony; but herein the <HI>Mattachuset</HI> had the worst end of the staff, in bearing as much, or more charge, then all the other three, and yet no greater number of Commissi∣oners to negotiate and judg in transacting of affairs concern∣ing peace and war, then the least of the other, and any one of the other as l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kely to involve them in a chargeable war with the naked Natives, that have neither plunder, nor cash to bear the charge of it, nay hitherto the most hath risen from the lesser colonies, yet are the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> far from desert∣ing them, esteeming them highly, so long as their Govern∣ments maintain the same purity in Religion with themselves, for indeed this is that they have spent their whole travel for, and therefore if <HI>Plimoth,</HI> or any of the other shall draw back herein, the chiefest end of their confederacy would be lost; for should it come to pass (that in venturing their persons

in <HI>Ʋncasses</HI> Court, on a day travelling alone by a thick swamp, <HI>Ʋncas</HI> call'd him out of the swamp, charging him to be true to him, in declaring to the English what he required to him, which was, that he should say he had been hired of <HI>Miantonemo</HI> to kill him, and to make his matter good, quoth the young man, he then cut his arm on the top, and under∣neath with the flint of his Gun, to make men think he had beene shot through with an arrow: This tale made the English more to suspect <HI>Miantonemo</HI> then before; and there∣fore desired to examine the young man alone, which he was very unwilling they should do; but upon further examina∣tion alone, they did verily believe this young man had done the fact, yet for present they let him depart with <HI>Miantone∣mo,</HI> advising him to send him home to <HI>Ʋncas,</HI> but by the way, he instead of returning him home, cut off his head, and forth∣with gathered an army of about a thousand men to fight with <HI>Ʋncas,</HI> who feared not to meet him in the field with half the number; the battel being come within shot one of another, with a great hubbub they let their long shafts fly one at another, and after came to a close with other wea∣pons, till the Narrowgansets multitude being forely distres∣sed by the <HI>Mawhiggins</HI> valour, they began to cry out <HI>Wem-meck,</HI> which is to say, enough: <HI>Ʋncas</HI> like a stout command∣er, with others of his bloud-royal that were about him, sought to perfect his victory, by possessing himself with the person of their Prince, which he effected, by putting his Life-guard to flight, and taking hold on the Sachim himself, carried him vi∣ctoriously away to the Town of <HI>Hartford,</HI> neer the which he kept his residence at this time, and then made the English ac∣quainted there with his noble design, and desired to have the advise of the united colonies what to do with his prisoner; the <HI>Narrowgansets</HI> sought to ransom him home, being much abashed, that so mean a Prince as <HI>Ʋncas</HI> was should scape scotfree with such a victory; but the honered Commission∣ers have had proof of <HI>Miantonemo's</HI> treachery, both toward this Prince that had him in possession, and toward the English in falsisying his promise with them; they advised <HI>Ʋncas</HI> to put him to death, but withall, that he should forbear to exercise

my barbarous cruelty toward him, as their manner is, and by this means the English prevented another war, both with English and Indians, which was very neer joyning in battel. Not many years after, the Indian Sachim upon this advise, caused <HI>Miantonemo</HI> to be led forth, as if he would remove him to a more safer place of custody, and by the way caused him to be executed; the Indians, his kindred and subjects, were much grieved at his death, yet took it quietly at pre∣sent, but the lesser Princes, his Neighbours, rather rejoyced, he having tyrannized over them, and enforced them to sub∣ject to his will, right or wrong.</P>

<PB N="186" REF="96"/>
also to complain of certain wrongs done them by these <HI>Gor∣toxists,</HI> who had thus in croached, and began to build on the Indians land; upon these complaints, the Governor and the honored Mr. <HI>Dudly</HI> issue forth their Warrant, to summon them to appear, they being then about five or six persons, without any means for instructing them in the wayes of God, and without any civil Government to keep them in civility or humanity, which made them to cast off most proudly and disdainfully any giving accompt to man of their actions, no not to the chiefest in authority, but returned back most insolent, scornful, scurrilous speeches. After this, the Government of the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> sent two messengers on purpose to per∣swade them to come and have their cause heard, assuring them like justice in their cause with any other; but <HI>Samuel Gorton</HI> being the ring-leader of the rout, was so full gorged with dreadful and damnable errors, (the which he had newly in∣snared these poor souls with) that soon after the departure of the messenger, he layes aside all civil justice, and instead of returning answer to the matter in hand, he vomits up a whole paper full of beastly stuff, one while scoffing and deriding the ignorance of all beside himself, that think <HI>Abraham, J∣saac,</HI> &amp;c. could be saved by Christ Jesus, who was after born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> another while mocking at the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper, in an opprobrious manner, deriding at the Elements Christ was pleased to institute them in, and calling them Negromancers that administer them at all; and in a word, all the Ordinances of the Gospel abomi∣nable Idolatry he called, and likened them to <HI>Molock,</HI> and the Star of the Idol <HI>Rempham;</HI> his paper was thrust full of such filthiness, that no Christian ear could hear them without indignation against them, and all was done by him in a very scornful and deriding manner, upbraiding all that use them; in the mean time magnifying his own glorious light, that could see himself to be personally Christ, God-Man, and so all others that would believe as he did: This paper he got to be subscribed, with about twelve or thirteen hands, his num∣ber of Disciples being encreased, for assuredly the man had a very glosing tongue, but yet very deceitful, for when he had

gave bountifully for the furthering this Wilderness-work, the which was expended upon great Artillery, his gift being a thousand pound, beside many persons that came over, the Lord was pleased to indow with a large portion of the things of this life, who were not backward liberally to dispose of it, to procure means of defence, ann to that end there was a ca∣stle built on an Island, upon the passage into the <HI>Mattachu-Bay,</HI> wholly built at first by the country in general, but by rea∣son the country affords no Lime, but what is burnt of Oyster-she is, it fell to decay in a few years after, which made many of the Towns that lay out of the defence thereof to desert it, although their safety (under God) was much involved in the constant repair and well-mannaging thereof; hereupon the next six Towns take upon them to rebuild it at their proper cost and charges, the rest of the country upon the finishing there∣of gave them a small matter toward it; upon this there was a Captain ordained, and put in possession thereof by the coun∣try, having a yearly Stipend allowed him for himself and his souldiers, which he is to keep in a constant readiness upon the Island, being about eight acres of ground; the Castle is built on the North-East of the Island, upon a rising hill, very ad∣vantageous to make many shot at such ships as shall offer to enter the Harbor without their good leave and liking, the Commander of it is one Captain <HI>Davenport,</HI> a man approved for his faithfulness, courage and skill, the Master Canoneer is an active Ingineer; also this Castle hath cost about four thou∣sand pounds, yet are not this poor pilgrim people weary of maintaining it in good repair, it is of very good use to awe a∣ny insolent persons, that putting confidence in their ship and sails, shall offer any injury to the people, or contemn the Government, they have certain signals of alarums, which sud∣dainly spread through the whole country; were there but one Town more erected in this Government, which were one and thirty, it would joyn all the Towns in the same neighbourly together, excepting Spring-field. Thus are these people with great diligence provided for these daies of war, hoping the day is at hand wherein the Lord will give Antichrist the don-christ the double of all her doings, and therefore they have
<PB N="195" REF="100"/>
nursed up in their Artillery garden some who have since been used, as instruments to begin the work; but that which gives the greatest hope concerning this particular, is this, that these times afford more souldiers depending on the Lord Christ through faith for deliverance and true valour, then any age since Antichrist began to fall, without which, all these prepa∣rations were but as so many traps and snares to catch a people in, and to the which these Commanders and souldiers are dai∣ly exhorted, and therefore let all people know that desire the downfal of <HI>New-England,</HI> they are not to war against a peo∣ple only exercised in feats of war, but men who are experien∣ced in the deliverances of the Lord from the mouth of the Li∣on, and the paw of the Bear; and now woe be to you, when the same God that directed the stone to the forehead of the Philistine, guides every bullet that is shot at you, it matters not for the whole rabble of Antichrist on your side, the God of Armies is for us a refuge high. <HI>Shela.</HI></P>

yet to declare to all the world, and render an ac∣compt of their faith and profession wherein they walk, it was thought meet, that the churches of Christ should meet toge∣ther in a Synod, by their Elders and Messengers to hold forth the doctrine and discipline of Jesus Christ, according to the rule of the New Testament, with the grounds of Scriptur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from which they hold the same; and further to make trial of them by the said rules and none other: accordingly at the time appointed they assembled together, their disputation was plain and easie to be understood of the meanest capacity, clear∣ing up those points that were most dubious, they having a∣greed on all matters, with a full concurrence of the assembly, did appoint them to be put in print, that they might be the better scanned and tried of every particular person in the se∣veral congregations or churches, many churches approving thereof for the generality, others there be that have not yet fully viewed the same, the books are extant, and shew that the churches of Christ in N.

<P>A His year, after the death of this godly Governour, was chosen to succeed in the place 10. <HI>Endicut</HI> Esq. and <HI>Tho.

<PB N="214" REF="110"/>
and with more warmer affections exhort one another, Come let us go up unto the house of the Lord, and he will teach us his wayes: Also the Lord was pleased to awaken us with an Army of caterpillers, that had he not suddainly rebuked them, they had surely destroyed the husband mans hope, where they fell upon trees, they left them like winter-wasting cold, bare and naked; and although they fell on fields very rarely, yet in some places they made as clear a riddance, as the har∣vest mans hand, and uncovered the gay green Medow ground, but indeed the Lord did by some plats shew us what he could have done with the whole, and in many places cast them into the high wayes, that the Cart-wheels in their passage were painted green with running over the great swarms of them; in some fields they devoured the leaves of their pease, and left the straw with the full crop, so tender was the Lord in his cor∣rection; this minded all these Jacobites of the end of their coming over, but chiefly the husbandman, whose over eager pursuit of the fruits of the earth, made some of them many times run out so far in this Wilderness, even out of the sweet sound of the silver Trumpets blown by the laborious Mini∣sters of Christ, forsaking the assembly of the Lords people, to celebrate their Sabbaths in the chimney-corner, horse, kine, sheep, goats, and swine, being their most indeared compani∣ons to travel with them to the end of their pilgrimage, or o∣therwise to gather together some of their neerest neighbours, and make a preachment one unto another, till they had learn'd so much, that they could away with none other teach∣ing: As also the Lord was pleased to command the wind and Seas to give us a jog on the elbow, by sinking the very chief of our shipping in the deep, and splitting them in shivers a∣gainst the shores; a very goodly Ship called the Seaforce was east away, and many N. E. people put to hard shifts for their lives, and some drowned, as the godly and dearly beloved servant of Christ, Mr. <HI>Tho, Coitmire,</HI> a very able Seaman, and also a good Scholar, one who had spent both his labour and estate for the helping on of this Wilderness-work: as also another ship set forth by the Merchants of New-haven, of which the godly Mr, <HI>Lamberton</HI> went Master, neither ship,

persons, nor goods ever heard of; another ship also built and set forth by the inhabitants of Cambridg, split and cast away neer the same place where the Seaforce was loft; as also ano∣ther Barque mostly set forth by Dorchester men, sank in the Sea, and never heard of the manner how; with divers others which might be here inserted; this seemed the sorer affliction to these N. E people, because many godly men lost their lives, and abundantly the more remarkable, because the Lord was pleased to forbid any such things to befal his people in their passage hither; herein these people read, as in great capital letters, their suddain forgetfulness of the Lords former recei∣ved mercy in his wonderful preservation, bringing over so many scores of ships, and thousands of persons, without mis∣carriage of any, to the wonderment of the whole world that shall hear of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut more especially were the Merchants and traders themselves sensible of the hand of the Lord out a∣gainst them, who were in some of the ships, and had their lixes given them for a prey; as also Vintners, and other men of trade, whose gain is increased by Merchants men, being so taken up with the income of a large profit, that they would willingly have had the Common wealth tolerate divers kinds of sinful opinions to intice men to come and sit down with us, that their purses might be filled with coyn, the civil Go∣vernment with contention, and the Churches of our Lord Christ with errors, the Lord was pleased after all this, to let in the King of Terror among his new-planted Churches.</P>

Thir year was the first noted year wherein any store of people died, the ayt and place being very healthy naturally, made this correction of the Lord seem the greater, for the most that died were chil∣dren, and that of an unwonted disease here, though fre∣quent in other places, the Lord now smiting many families with death in them, although there were not any families wherein more then one died, or very rare if it were other∣wise,
<PB N="216" REF="111"/>
yet were these pilgrim people minded of the suddain forgetfulness of those worthies that died not long before, but more especially the little regard had to provide means to train their children up in the knowledg of learning, and im∣prove such means as the Lord hath appointed to leave their posterity an able Minister; as also to stir them up to prepare for the great work of the Lord Jesus in the overthrow of An∣tichrist, and calling of the Jews, which in all likelyhood is very suddainly to be performed; as also in stirring up all the young ones that remain, to consider for what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Lord hath spared their lives, when he cut off others by death, name∣ly, to prosecute the work that he hath given them to do in the power of his might, with the greater zeal and cou∣rage.</P>

Churches, somewhat more then ordinary in a sore disease, of which many (in comparison of what used to do) and yet not so many as ordinarily use to do in other plantations of this Western world; and whereas the former year young children died most, this year those of grown years died also, and although so small a sickness might not be ta∣ken notice of in other places, yet the rareness of it in so heal∣thy a country as is this, cannot but speak loud in the ears of Gods people, who desire to hear the rod, and who hath ap∣pointed it, and perceive plainly many of them, that the Lord will have us to know, that if his own people tread in the
<PB N="217" REF="111"/>
same steps of riot and excess in the plenty he hath given them, with the men of this world, he will lay the same sicknesses and diseases upon them; and further they perceive, according to the ordinary dispensation of his providences toward them, he hath some further great work to do with his N. E. people, that he is beginning again to a waken, rouze up, and quicken them with the rod of his power: For thus they begin to rea∣son with themselves, when the Lord was pleased to expose them, their wifes, and little ones to the troubles of a tempe∣stuous Sea in so long a voyage, and the wants of a barren Wil∣derness in great penury of food, he brought forth by his mighty power, and stretched-our arm, the glorious fabrick of his New-E. Churches; and therefore now again they look for some further extraordinary great work of his, if he shall once again be pleased to refine them in this furnace of his, and would the Lord Christ would confirm our brethren in England in like faith by our example, yea, and far beyond many de∣grees, as the Wonder-working providence of Sions Saviour toward them hath more abundantly exceeded, and that as this in three seven years is comprised, though very weakly in this little book, there's in one seven year would require vo∣lumes, and as this is wonderful, there is almost miraculous, and wonderful to the whole world, as if the Lord Christ did intend to make his power known more abundantly, then ever the sons of men saw Kings and Kingdoms strengthened, with affinity and consanguinity, the valiant of the world, men skil'd in feats of war, as <HI>Goliah</HI> from a child, fierce and pampered horses, whose necks are covered with strong neighing, and cunning Engeniers, men skilful to destroy with all the terrible engins of war, together with swarms of souldiers flocking together to swallow up the poor remnant of Gods people, all these hath the Lord caused to fall before your eyes, and our ears have heard the noyse of this great fall; and beloved countrymen, and our dear brethren in Christ, step into the closet of your own hearts with us, and see if there will not be some things in this following verse that may suit your con∣dition as well as ours, that having sown in tears, we may reap with joy the glorious harvest of our Lord Christ, which is

hard at hand, for assuredly the Lord is tyed neither to us, nor you, but may, if it please him, cast off both, and raise up new instruments for his following work, but if he be pleased to give us melting hearts for our former miscarriages, and renew us with a more zealous courage and earnest contending for the faith, it is very like he hath more glorious works by far for us yet to do.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Of the endeavours of this people of Christ, to inlarge his King∣dom the world throughout, and first of their preaching Christ to the Indians, among whom they live.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THese brood of Travellers having thus through the good hand of their God upon them, thus setled these Churches, according to the institution of Christ, and not by the will of man; they now endeavour to be assisting to others: The reverend Mr. <HI>Hugh Peters,</HI> and his fellow-helper in Christ Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> steered their course for England, so soon as they heard of the chaining up of those biting beasts, who went under the name of spiritual Lords; what assistance the Gospel of Christ found there by their preach∣ing, is since clearly manifested; for the Lord Christ ha∣ving removed that usurping power of Lordly Prelates, hath now inlarged his Kingdom there, and that not one∣ly by the means of these men, but by divers others, both godly and eminent servants of his, who never saw New-England; and by divers other godly Ministers of Christ, who have since gone from hence, both young Students and others, to the number of twenty, or thereabout, in the whole; besides some who were eminent in the civil Go∣vernment here, both gracious and godly servants of Christ, and some who have been Magistrates here, to the number of five or six, the Lord Christ grant they may all endeavour the advancement of his truths, both in Churches and ci∣vil Government: But before the Author cease to speak of England, he is bold to say, that the Lord Christ will overturn, overturn, overturn, till he hath caused such a Go∣vernment to be set up, as shall become nursing fathers to his new-planted Churches.</P>
<P>The Indian people in these parts at the English first com∣ing, were very barbarous and uncivilized, going for the most part naked, although the country be extreme cold
<PB N="227" REF="115"/>
cold in the winter-season: they are onely clothed with a Deers skin, and a little bit of cloth to cover their privy part. The Wo∣men for the most part are very modest, although they go as naked as the Men: they are generally very laborious at their planting time, and the Men extraordinary idle, making their squawes to carry their Children and the luggage beside; so that many times they travell eight or ten mile with a burden on their backs, more fit∣ter for a horse to carry then a woman. The men follow no kind of labour but hunting, fishing and fowling, in all which they make use of their Bowe and Arrowes to shoot the wilde creatures of the Trees, as Squirrells, gray and black Rockoones: as for Deer, they ordinarily catch them in traps, with a pole bent down, and a Cord at the end, which flyes up and stayes their hasty course. <HI>Bever, Otter,</HI> and <HI>Moose</HI> they catch with Traps also: they are very good marks-men, with their Bowe and Arrows. Their Boyes will ordinarily shoot fish with their Arrowes as they swim in the shallow Rivers, they draw the Arrow halfe way putting the point of it into the water, they let flye and strike the fish through; the like they do to Birds lesser and great: onely the <HI>Geese</HI> and <HI>Turkies</HI> being strong of wing, somtimes flee away with their Arrowes sticking in them; this is all the trade they use, which makes them destitute of many recessaries, both in meat, drink, ap∣parell and houses.</P>
<P>As for any religious observation, they were the most destitute of any people yet heard of, the Divel having them in very great subjection, not using craft to delude them, as he ordinarily doth in most parts of the World: but kept them in a continuall slavish fear of him: onely the <HI>Powawes,</HI> who are more conversant with him, then any other, sometimes recover their sicke folk with charmes, which they use, by the help of the Divell; and this makes them to adore such; one of them was seen as is reported to cure a Squaw that was dangerously sick, by taking a snakes skin and winding it about her arm the which soon became a living snake crawling round about her armes and body; another caused the sick patient for healing, to pass bare footed through many burning coals; those that cannot cure them, they call Squantams powwons: but if the patient live, he is had in great admiration, and then they cry, Much winnit Abbamocho, that is, very good
<PB N="226" REF="116"/>
Divell: for Squantam is a bad Divel, and Abbamocho is their good Divell. It hath been a thing very frequent, before the English came, for the Divell to appear unto them in a bodily shape, some∣times very ugly and terrible, and sometimes like a white boy, and chiefly in the most hideous woods and swamps: they report that sometimes he hath come into their wigwams, and carryed away divers of them alive: and since we came hither, they tell us of a very terrible beast for shape and bigness, that came into a wigwam toward the North-east parts, remote from any English plantations, and took away six men at a time, who were never seen afterward. The English at their first coming did assay and endeavour to bring them to the knowledge of God: and in par∣ticular the reverend, grave, and godly Mr. <HI>John Wilson,</HI> who visited their sick, and instructed others as they were capable to under∣stand him. But yet very little was done that way, till in process of time they by continuall coming to the English, became bet∣ter able to understand them; and now of late yeers the reverend Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> hath been more then ordinary laborious to study their language, instructing them in their own Wigwams, and Ca∣techising their Children. As also the reverend Mr. <HI>Mayhewe,</HI> one who was tutored up in <HI>N. Eng.</HI> and called to office by the Church of Christ, gathered at a small Island called <HI>Martins Vineyard:</HI> this man hath taken good pains with them: but the particulars of our godly Ministers labours, together with the good hand of our God upon their indeavours, being already published, no further need be spoken. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aso Mr.</HI> Wil∣liam Leveriry <HI>Pastor of</HI> Sandwich <HI>Church, is very serious therein, and with good success.</HI></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of the gratious goodness of the Lord Christ, in planting his Gospel in the purety of it, in</HI> Virginia: <HI>and of the first Church gathered there according to the rule of the Gospel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ABout the yeer the Lord was pleased to put it into the heare of some godly people in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to send to <HI>N. E.</HI> for some of the Ministers of Christ, to be helpfull unto them in instructing them in the truth, as it is in Jesus. The godly Mr. <HI>Phi∣lip Bennit</HI> coming hither, made our reverend Elders acquainted with their desires, who were very studious to take all opportu∣nities for inlarging the kingdome of Christ: and upon serious con∣sideration, the reverend Mr. <HI>Knowls</HI> of <HI>Watertowne,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tompson</HI> of <HI>Braintree</HI> were sent unto them, who ariving there in safety, preached openly unto the people for some good space of time, and also from house to house exhorted the people dayly, that with full purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord; the harvest they had was plentifull for the little space of time they were there, till being opposed by the Governour and some other malignant spirits, they were forced to returne to <HI>N. E.</HI> again. It were much to be desired, that all people would take notice of the hand of God against this people, after the rejection of these Ministers of Christ: and indeed it was none other but the thrusting Christ from them; and now attend to the following story, all you Cavaliers and malignant party the world through∣out, take notice of the wonderworking providence of Christ toward his Churches, and punishing hand of his toward the contemners of his Gospel. Behold ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dispisers, and wonder. Oh poor <HI>Virginia▪</HI> dost thou send away the Ministers of Christ with threatning speeches? No sooner is this done, but the barba∣rous, inhumane, insolent, and bloody <HI>Indians</HI> are let loose upon them, who contrive the cutting them off by whole Families, closely carying their wicked counsells till they had effected their desires, their bloody designe taking place for the space of 200 miles
<PB N="226" REF="117"/>
up the River: the manner of the English Plantations there being very scattering quite contrary to <HI>N. E.</HI> people, who for the most part desire society. The manner of the <HI>Indians</HI> proceeding was thus, they divided themselves into severall companies, and beset the English houses a little before break of day, waiting for the first person that should open the doore and come forth, whom they cruelly murdered, beating out their brains, and then forth∣with entred the house and slew all they found within, sometimes fi∣ring the houses, and leaving the living children miserably to be con∣sumed with their dead Parents in the fearfull flames; some peo∣ple fleeing from this barbarous massacre, as they passed by a fired house heard a pitifull out-cry of a poor Child, crying, I burn, I burn: although they could willingly have made haste a∣way, yet the miserable out-cry of this poor babe, caused them to haft to the house, and rescue it forth the flames, that was even al∣most ready to scorch it: this cruell and bloody work of theirs put period to the lives of five or six hundred of these people, who had not long before a plentifull proffer of the mercies of Christ in the glad tidings of peace published by the mouth of his Ministers, who came unto them for that end: but chusing rather the fellowship of their drunken companions, and a Preist of their own profession, who could hardly continue so long sober as till he could read them the reliques of mans invention in a com∣mon prayer book; but assuredly had not the Lord pittied the little number of his people among this crooked generation, they had been consumed at once for this is further remarkable in this massa∣cre, when it came toward the place where Christ had placed his little flock, it was discovered &amp; prevented from further proceeding, and the Lord by this means did so allay their spirits of ma∣lignity toward his people, they gathered in a Church in presence of the very governour himself, and called to office one Mr. <HI>Har∣rison,</HI> who could not long continue among them, by reason of their fresh renewed malignity, who had formerly an evill eye to∣ward them, and could no better refraine from oppressing them, then <HI>Pharoah</HI> after he had rest from the plagues under which he was. After the departure of Mr. <HI>Harrison,</HI> one Mr. <HI>Duren</HI> became an help unto them; but he and his people also were forced to remove many hundred miles up into the country, where they
<PB N="231" REF="117"/>
now remain; but assuredly the Lord hath more scourges in store, for such as force the people to such sufferings: and therefore let this Church of Christ continue in the way of his truth according to the rules of his Gospel, and without doubt the Lord will preserve and continue them, let the adversaries of his Truth be never so potent. As also about this time, the Lord was pleased to gather a people together in the Isle of <HI>Bermoodas,</HI> whose hearts being guided by the rule of the word, they gathered into a Church of Christ according to the rules of the Gospel, being <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Natha∣neel White, <HI>Mr.</HI> Patrick, Copeland, <HI>Mr.</HI> William Gol∣ding.</NOTE> provided with able persons, indued with gifts from the Lord to administer unto them the holy things of God; and after they be∣gan to be opposed, their reverend elder Mr. <HI>Goulding</HI> came in∣to these parts, and from hence he went to <HI>England:</HI> but this lit∣tle flock of Christ not long after being banished from thence, went to one of the Southern Islands, where they endured much hardship; and which the Churches of Christ in these parts understanding, about six or eight of them contributing toward their want, ga∣thered about 800 <HI>l.</HI> to supply their necessity: the which they shipped in a small vessell hired for that end and sent by the hands of two brethren both corne and other necessaries: they arriving in safety by the blessing of God upon their labours, were well welcomed by their brethren, who abundantly blessed the Lord for them, and with godly and gratious expression returned a thankfull acknowledgement of the present good hand of the Lord Christ, in providing for them: so that as this book began with the wonderworking providence of <HI>Sions</HI> Saviour, in pro∣viding so wonderfull gratiously for his Churches the World throughout; so it here endeth with the same; and it were to be desired, that the Churches of Christ in <HI>Europe</HI> would gather up the wonderfull providences of the Lord toward them also, and more especially those in our native Country: for assuredly it would make much for the magnifying of his glorious works in this day of his power: and although the malignant and antichristi∣an party may say, they can shew the like wonders (as <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres</HI> that with-stood <HI>Moses)</HI> yet were the worke of Christ for his poor Churches, within these few yeers, gathered together by some able instrument whom the Lord might be pleased to stir up for that end, and laid open the view of all, they would be
<PB N="230" REF="118"/>
forced to confess, this is the very finger of God, and no doubt but they would be a great strengthening to the faith of those, who are appointed of the Lord for the overthrow of Antichrist (the Lord helping) for assuredly the time of his having mercy upon <HI>Sion</HI> is come.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Of the time of the fall of Antichrist, and the increase of the Gentile Churches, even to the prevoking of the twelve Tribes to submit to the kingdom of Christ.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT hath been the longing expectation of many, to see that nota∣ble and wonderfull worke of the Lord Christ, in casting down that man of sin who hath held the whole world (of those that profess any Christ) under his Lordly power, while the true professors of Christ have hardly had any appearance to the eye of the world; first, take notice the Lord hath an assured se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time for the accomplishment of this work, which is set down in his word, although more darkly to be under stood; wherefore the reverend Ministers of Christ, for these many yeers have studied <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 17.14.</NOTE> and laboured for the finding it out, and that holy man of God Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> among many other, hath diligently searched for the Lords mind herein, and hath declared some sudden blow to be given to this blood-thirsty monster: but the Lord Christ hath unseparably joyned the time, meanes, and manner of this work together, and therefore all men that expect the day, must attend the means: for such hath been and is the absurdity of many, that they make semblance of a very zealous affection to see the glorious work of our Lord Christ herein, and yet themselves uphold, or at least side with those that uphold some part of Anti∣christs kingdome: and therefore the lordly Prelacy may pray for his fall till their lungs are spent, and their throats grow dry. But while they have a seeming shew (and hardly that) to oppose his doctrines, they themselves in the mean time, make use of his power to advance themselves to honour: a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also in these dayes there are divers desperate, blasphemous, and erronious per∣sons,
<PB N="231" REF="118"/>
whose consciences and their own self-will are unseparable companions; these are very hot in their own apprehensions to prosecute the work; but in the mean time, they not only batter down the truths of Christ, and his own Ordinances and Instituti∣ons, but also set up that part of Antichrists kingdom, which hath formerly had a great blow already, even his deceiveable and damnable doctrines: for as one badg of the beast is to be sull of blasphemies, so are they, and these take unto themselves seven spirits worse then the former, making the latter and worse then the beginning, as this story may testifie: and some stories in our native country much more. But to come to the time of Anti∣christs fall, and all that expect it may depend upon the certainty of it: yea it may be boldly said that the time is come, and all may see the dawning of the day: you that long so much for it, come forth and fight: who can expect a victory without a battel? the lordly Prelates that boasted so much of these great atcheive∣ments in this work, are fled into holes and corners: <HI>Familists, Seekers, Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> they are so ill armed, that they think it best sleeping in a whole skin, fearing that if the day of battell once go on, they shall fall among Antichrists Ar∣mies: and therefore cry out like cowards, If you will let me alone, and I will let you alone: but assuredly the Lord Christ hath said, <HI>He that is not with us, is against us:</HI> there is no room in his Army for toleratorists. But some will say▪ We will never believe the day i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come till our eyes behold <HI>Babylon</HI> be∣girt with Souldiers. I pray be not too hasty; hath not the Lord said, <HI>Come out of her my people?</HI> &amp;c. surely there is a little space left for this, and now is the time, seeing the Lord hath set up his standerd of resort: now, <HI>Come forth of her, and he not partakers of her sins:</HI> now is the time, when the Lord hath assembled his Saints together; now the Lord will come and not tar∣ry. As it was necessary that there should be a <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> before the Lord would deliver his people and destroy <HI>Pharaoh</HI> lest they should be wildred indeed in the Wilderness; so now it was needfull, that the Churches of Christ should first obtain their purity, and the civill government its power to defend them, before Antichrist come to his finall ruine: and because you shall be sure the day is come indeed, behold the Lord Christ mar∣shalling
<PB N="230" REF="119"/>
of his invincible Army to the battell: some suppose this onely to be mysticall, and not literall at all: assuredly the spiri∣tuall fight is chiefly to be attended, and the other not neglected, having a neer dependancy one upon the other, especially at this time; the Ministers of Christ who have cast off all lording power over one another, are created field-Officers, whose Office is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Yea every Officer hath his own proper Re∣giment.</NOTE> ex∣travagant in this Army, chiefly to encourage the fighting Souldi∣ers, and to lead them on upon the enemy in the most advanta∣gious places, and bring on fresh supplies in all places of danger, to put the sword of the spirit in their Souldiers hands: but Christ (who is their general) must onely enable them to use it aright: to give every Souldier in charge that they watch over one another, to see that none meddle with the execrable things of Antichrist, and this to be performed in every Regiment throughout the Army: and not one to exercise dominion over the other by way of superiority: for Christ hath appointed a parity in all his Regiments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> let them beware that none go apart with rebellious <HI>Korah.</HI> And further, behold, Kings, Rulers, or Generals of Earths Armies, doth Christ make use of in this day of battell, the which he hath brought into the field already also; who are appointed to defend, uphold, and maintain the whole body of his Armies against the insolent, beastly, and bloody cruelty of their insatiable enemies, and to keep order that none do his fellow-Souldier any wrong, nor that any should raise a mutiny in the hosts. Notwithstanding all this, if any shall say, they will not believe the day is come till they see them ingage battell with Antichrist; Verily, if the Lord be pleased to open your eyes, you may see the beginning of the fight, and what success the Armies of our Lord Christ have hitherto had: the Forlorne hopes of Antichrists Army, were the proud Prelates of <HI>England:</HI> the Forlorne of Christs Armies, were these <HI>N. E.</HI> people who are the subject of this History, which encountring each other for some space of time, ours being overpowered with multitude, were forced to retreat to a place of greater safety, where they waited for a fresh opportunity to ingage with the main battell of Antichrist, so soon as the Lord shall be pleased to give a word of Command. Immediately upon this success, the Lord Christ was pleased to command the right Wing of his Army, to advance against the left Wing of Anti∣christ:
<PB N="233" REF="119"/>
where in his former forlorn hopes of proud Prelates lay: these by our right Wing had their first pay (for that they had done to our forlorne before) being quite overthrown and cut in peices by the valiant of the Lord in our right Wing, who still remain fighting. Thus far of the battell of Antichrist, and the various success; what the issue will be, is assuredly known in the generall already. <HI>Babylon</HI> is fallen, the God of truth hath said it; then who would not be a Souldier on Christs side, where is such a certainty of victory? nay I can tell you a farther word of encou∣ragement, every true-hearted Souldier that falls by the sword in this fight, shall not lye dead long, but stand upon his feet again, and be made partaker of the triumph of this Victory: and none can be overcome, but by turning his back in fight. And for a word of terrour to the enemy, let them know, Christ will never give over the raising of fresh Forces, till they are overthrown root and branch. And now you antient people of <HI>Israel</HI> look out of your Prison grates, let these Armies of the Lord Christ Jesus provoke you to acknowledge he is certainly come, I and speedily he doth come to put life into your dry bones: here is a people not onely praying but fighting for you, that the great block may be removed out of the way, (which hath hindered hitherto) that they with you may enjoy that glorious resurrection-day, the glori∣ous nuptials of the Lamb: when not only the Bridegroom shall ap∣pear to his Churches both of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> (which are his spouse) in a more brighter aray then ever heretofore, but also his Bride shall be clothed by him in the richest garments that ever the Sons of men put on, even the glorious graces of Christ Jesus, in such a glorious splendor to the eyes of man, that they shall see and glo∣rifie the Father of both Bridegroom and Bride.</P>
