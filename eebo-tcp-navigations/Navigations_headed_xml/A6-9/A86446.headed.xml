<HEAD>A Terrible and Bloudy Sea-fight between the English and the Dutch, upon the Coast of Cornwal: with the particulars there∣of; and the number of ships sunk, burnt and taken on both sides; the like dispute hath not been heard of these many yeares.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the fourteenth instant, the Dutch Arma∣do (consisting of fourscore and ten sayl, and twelve Fire-ships) mounted on their Warlike Throne, set forth Precepts to our sons of Thunder, and chased Captain Bane into this Harbour, who brings advertisements to the Ma∣jor and Governour, that the whole Fleet are stand∣ing
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>up towards the Isle of Wight; from whence we hear, that they bare up on the back-side, and sailed directly to Sir George Ayscue, who were riding thirty miles off from Plymouth: And on the six∣teenth instant, De-Witte their Admiral, with the rest of his Men of War, even like a Grove of Ce∣dars, bore up with hoisted and booming sailes to∣wards the South-East Sound, resolving to act the Theatre of War upon that part of Neptune's Regi∣on; in order thereunto, the Vice-Admiral of Zea∣land, with twenty stout ships, and eleven Frigats, drew forth, and prepared themselves for an Assault; which Sir George Ayscue perceiving, gave imme∣diate Orders and Instructions to all his Captains, to ply windward, and to receive their salutation, which was acted with such a revengeful rage, that both parties being inflamed, resolv'd to fight untill the one was tamed; insomuch, that Sir George with the Rainbow, charged them quite through, but not be∣ing able to go to the windward of all, received 40 broad sides, and with great difficulty got off, onely with the loss of three men, and his Bolt-split. In the midst of this dispute, the rest of our ships were not silent; but each man acted with an irresistable cou∣rage and resolution; And from four of the clock, till 8 at night, the fight was extream hot; Then Nights
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>sable Curtains being drawn the dispute ceased, and both fleets lay in a defensive posture against each o∣ther, with all their lights hanging forth. This Con∣flict was maintained with great gallantry and reso∣lution on both sides; and great was the execution; for we have received great loss, the George and Bo∣naventure, being much shatter'd and torn, and for the present unfit for service; divers were rent limb from limb by the Canon-shot; some had their arms shot off; others, their legs; amongst the rest, valiant Captain Pack, (an excellent stout Sea-man) hath his leg shot off; Captain Lisle is wounded in the shoul∣der, and since dead; Capt. Clerk is said to be slain, &amp; divers others. Sir George lost 12 men, besides some wounded; and received 60 shot in her Hull; the Sampson, Elizabeth, and divers others, received great loss, and many a stout Sea-man hath made the Sea his grave; and too too many (for the present) lies languishing of their wounds.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, the Hollander hath little cause to brag, for his loss is exceeding great, many of their ships are rent and torn; the Rear Admiral is sunk, the Captain of Flushing, the Armes of Hol∣land (beware the Body next) and three other gallant ships.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>However, the Dutch-men resolved not to decline engagement; but lay in a defen∣sive posture till Tuesday morning; at which time, they hung forth their bloudy flag of defiance, on the Top-mast head; and gave sundry Vollies from aboard, retaining them as Trophies of Victory; the which, did so exasperate the spirits of the English, that a Councel of War was called, to consult what to do, in further proceedings against the enemy, and it was unanimously resolved by the said Councel to ingage them again: Hereupon preparation was made, and after prayers, and seeking of God, for a blessing upon their enterprise, the Admiral, with 33 Men of War, hoisted sail, and stood up to∣wards them; and about one of the clock in the Afternoon, both Navies engaged, and for the space of seven houres furiously was the fight maintained, and great execution a∣gain
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>done on both sides, especially to the Hollanders; but the night drawing on, the dispute ended: And this morning the ene∣my had given us the slip about six leagues; some of our ships are in pursuit; others are, come into this Harbour, with wounded men.</P>
<P>The five hundred men sent from this Town to Sir George, deported themselves with singular dexterity and courage, and were in the thickest of the Conflict; many of them are slain, and about 60 wounded.</P>
<P>This hath been the bloudiest Conflict that ever hapned between the two Repub∣liques; and consequently, 'tis but a begining of the Chaos of confusion; for it is now too late to dispute the Ground-work, the Ar∣guments of bloud being drawn at large in undeniable Maximes: Yet I doubt not, but the Lord will perfect that Work which he
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>hath thus triumphantly carried on, even for those who desire to praise and magnifie his glorious Name. As for the particulars of the fight, I cannot represent no otherwise, at present, but that we have taken seventeen, sunk five, fired two, and dispersed the rest; but not without great loss, as is before spe∣cified; which is all at present, from</P>
