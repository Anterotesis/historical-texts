<HEAD>THE BLOODY ATTEMPTS Vpon the Kingdom of <HI>IRELAND</HI> in general, and on <HI>DUBLIN</HI> in parti∣cular; and how it first began.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the three and twentieth day of October 1641. the Castle of <HI>Dublin</HI> should have beene surprised, (as at that time it might easily have been) for there was no fear or suspition of Treachery, there being at that time 400. Irish Papists elected out of most parts of Ireland, desperate persons, designed and appointed for that bloudy and desperate attempt, all lodging and sculking in several places of the City and Suburbs, waiting and expecting the time and watch-word, when to give the onset. One of their own Country-men at that time, ab∣horring so foul and detestable a Treason, revealed it to Sir <HI>William Parsons</HI> Knight and Baronet, Ma∣ster of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Sir <HI>Iohn Borlase</HI> Knight, Master of the Ordnance, both Lords Justices of the Kingdom of Ireland. The party who discovered the plot, had been formerly a servant to Sir <HI>Iohn Clotworthy,</HI> but at the time when he revealed their designe, he served one Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahowne</HI> an Irishman, who lodged at
<PB REF="16"/> the signe of the artichoak, vulgarly called S. <HI>Ma∣ries</HI> Abbey in the suburbs of the City of Dublin, The servants name was <HI>Owen Mack-Connel,</HI> who being with his master Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahown,</HI> in a house in Cookstreet, at the lodging of the Lord <HI>Mack-Gueere,</HI> also an Irishman in the City of Dub∣lin. Vpon the two and twentieth of Octob. being the night before: his master did then and there reveal the whole plot unto him in the presence of the Lord <HI>Mack-Gueere,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>This <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> had married an English woman, by whom he had children living in the County of Antrim, in the Province of Vlster, and she was and is a Protestant; assoon as <HI>Owen Mack Connel</HI> had heard and understood the plot, and their damnable intentions, with a sad countenance asked his Master what should become of his wife and poor children, he replyed in these words: <HI>hang her English Kite, we will get thee a better Wife:</HI> But the Company perceiving that his thoughts were troubled at the relation of this horrid Tra∣gedy, now to be acted on the stage of Ireland, that within few houres was to be in a flame of confusi∣on, the word to be given, that, man, woman, and child should have been butchered the next morn∣ing: the poor mans heart failed him at this hellish and barbarous massacre, whereupon these bloody Villains, perceiving by the alteration of his coun∣tenance that he approved not, or rather, like a man
<PB REF="16"/> amazed, startled at such a bloody motion, as to im∣brue his hands of his owne dearest wife and chil∣dren, and that that is more, of his owne Country and Kingdom, they began to bethink themselves what to do with him; they resolved to make him drunk, and thereupon enforced him unnaturally, to drink so much that he could hardly drink more, yet they plyed him close, he desired to be excused, they to give him his load powred it downe his throat, he resisting such unreasonable violence, there steps towards him one <HI>Donal Mack-Gueere,</HI> saying, will you not drink your liquor, see if you dare deny to pledge me? thereupon set a pistol to his brest with two bullets, the pan being primed with powder and brimstone, that so it might not fail to speed, twice it was offered against him, and took no fire, whereupon Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahown</HI> stept in and said, <HI>let him alone, God will not suffer him to be killed, he will be on our side I warrant ye.</HI> They after∣wards led him from the lord <HI>Mack-Gueers</HI> lodging to Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahowns</HI> lodging, but the poor man, faining himself more drunk then he was, and taking the advantage of the time and place, wil∣lingly fell down in a dirty channel, and was so bemired with mud, that none would help him up, but with much adoe he crept out of the kennel, and reeled to the stoop of a door, and sate downe to sleep, he seeming to sleep, the fellow which was left with him to watch with him, departed,
<PB REF="17"/> which this <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> perceiving, assoon as ever his back was turned, with a bold resolution arose up, and went to the Marchants key in Dub∣lin, between eleven and twelve of the clock at night to Sir <HI>William Parsons</HI> house, one of the Lord Justices of Ireland, where knocking at the doore, the Porter knowing him, demanded of him what he would have, he answered he must needs speak with his Lord, the Porter replyed his Lord was in bed, It is no matter answered <HI>Owen Mack-Connel,</HI> I must and will speak with him, for my businesse concerns both King and Kingdom; then the Por∣ter let him in, wondring to see him in such a pic∣kle, still he hastened the porter, until he had called up one of his Lords Gentlemen, who got up spee∣dily, and went into his Lords bed-chamber, where he acquainted his Lord with the earnest desire this <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> had to speak with him concer∣ning a businesse of weighty consequence, but would not reveal it to any but his Honour, where∣upon he was called up &amp; had accesse to my Lord, unto whom he discovered the whole plot, which was to be executed the same morning at 9. of the clock, this being between twelve and one.</P>
<P>At the first the Lord <HI>Parsons</HI> did seem to slight it, but <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> confidently affirmed the thing to be true, and withal told him thus, my lord <HI>I have discharged my duty and my conscience, look you to it; I will go back to my master, because neither he, nor the rest shall suspect me.</HI></P>

<P>Your Lordship shall find my lord <HI>Mack-Gueere</HI> at M. <HI>Cadowgans</HI> house, and Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahowne</HI> at the Artichoak, whither I now goe. This <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> going to his masters lodging, takes dirt in his hands, and besmuts his face, that they might think he had tumbled over and over in the dirt: whose approach into the room (where many were assembled together, drinking; for they in∣tended not to go to bed) was so ridiculous, that the company burst out into such a laughter, the place rung of them round about: and to welcome him home, the company fell to their old course, to make him drink more, but he told them that he must needs go into the yard, so they suffered him but commanded two of his companions to attend him, and bring him up again, but they let him go into the yard by himself: no sooner was he in the yard, but he leaped over the pale, and so escaped.</P>

<HEAD>A true Description of sundry sad and lamen∣table Collections, taken from the monthes of very credible Persons, and out of Letters sent from Ireland to this Citie of London, of the perfidious outrages and barbarous cru∣elties which the Irish Papists have com∣mitted upon the persons of the Protestants, both men, women, and children in that Kingdom, since <HI>Anno Dom. 1641.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Irish nation is a people both proud and envious. The Commonaltie ignorant and illiterate, poor, and lazie: and will rather beg or starve, then work; and therefore fit subject for the Priests and Iesuits to spur on upon such bloudy actions and murtherous designes.</P>
<P>It is too well known that the Irish have mur∣thered of the Protestant party in the provinces of Vlster, Leinster, Connaght, and Munster, of men women, and children, the number of fifty thou∣sand, as it is credibly reported by Englishmen, who have been over all parts of the Kingdom, and do protest upon their oaths, that there are above five thousand families destroyed.</P>
<P>The Irish have most murtherously and trayte∣rously surprised them upon great advantages, and
<PB REF="19"/> without respect of persons, either of age, youth, or infancie, of young men or maids, or of old men or babes, stript all to their skins, naked as ever they were born into the World, so they have gone out of the World, many starved to death for want of food and rayment; the Irish have shewed them no more compassion, nor so much as they do to their dogs.</P>
<P>At <HI>Belturbait</HI> in the County of Cavan, the Po∣pish Rebels demanded the Town, on promise that if they would surrender, they should passe free with bag and baggage: On serious considerations of the inhabitants and the Governour, they were perswaded to yeeld it up, which when they had done; they sent about twenty or thirty to guard them; when they had guarded them seven miles from the Town, they seised on them, robbed all the Protestants, being between five hundred and a thousand persons, men, women, and children: who submitting themselves to their mercy, found no quarter but cruelty: they stript them all naked, and turned them into the open fields in bitter cold weather, not affording them one of their lowzy rags to hide those parts which even nature com∣mands to be covered.</P>
<P>In <HI>London-Derry,</HI> belonging to the Londoners, Sir <HI>Philem Oneal</HI> promised under hand and seal to let the poor Protestants passe with bag and bag∣gage, onely to part with their Town: yet this

<P>One M. <HI>Luttrell</HI> was basely betrayed by an Irish boy that he had bred up in his house: who when he was at dinner, was surprised by threescore o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Irish unmercifull villains, with a company of whores and bastards that followed them which this boy let in at a back door, where pul∣ling him and his wife from the Table, and fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> small children, and one sucking at her breast: stript them naked, and then thrusting them in a violent manner out of dores, threatned to kill them if they went not speedily away.

<P>In the County of Roscommon, there fled in∣to the parish Church eleven score of the English, men, women, and children, where they remain∣ed three daies and nights without any sustenance, till they were almost starved: so that at last they were forced to commit themselves to the cruelty of the Irish, who stript them naked, after drove them through the Towne like so many harmlesse Lambs over a Bridge at the Townes end, having before broke downe one of the middle arches, where a strong water runneth, so that either they must leap in, or come back, their intent being there to murther them, as they did: For the poor wretches being sick, weak and faint for food and sleep, some returned back, whom they killed with∣out mercy, others they thrust into the water, who were drowned: some that could, did swimme towards the shore, and there, inhumane villains, they ran and met them before they could get to land, and knockt them on the head in the wa∣ter.</P>

<P>In the County of <HI>Tyrone</HI> was the cruellest mur∣ther of all the rest, committed by some Souldi∣ers upon the bodies of one M. <HI>Charles Davenant,</HI> his wife, and two young children.

The servant that knew him could speak good Irish, and so escaped, being an eye-witnesse of these passages ensuing. This <HI>Swillyrane</HI> and his rout broke in forcibly into the house, where they found M. <HI>Davenant</HI> with his wife and children, they immediately seised upon him and his wife, and bound them both fast in their chaires, making a great fire, after they stripped the two children, slue them in the sight of their parents, and after rosted them upon spits before their faces, they were compelled (poore souls) to behold that cruelty which they could not help: after they stript his wife, forcing her most uncivilly and unmercifully before his face: and afterward cut her throat: the distressed Gentleman being over pressed with the lamenta∣ble sight of the death of his wife and children, stri∣ved and strugled in his chair where he was bound, hoping they would have kild him, chusing rather to die any death, then to live any longer.

<P>In the County of <HI>Fermannagh,</HI> Mr <HI>Champion</HI> was betrayed by an Irish Villaine (his Tenant) whom he had saved twice before from the gallows: the rogues name was <HI>Patrick Mack-Dermot,</HI> who find∣ing one of his Companions, brings him to Master <HI>Champion</HI>'s house, and tells Mr <HI>Champion</HI> that hee found this thief stealing of his cattle: the Gentle∣man knowing this <HI>Mack-Dermot,</HI> said unto him before one Mr <HI>Iremonger,</HI> I am glad thou art turn'd from a thief to catch a thief; whereupon hee re∣turned him this answer, that Hee was no more thief than himselfe. No sooner had he utter'd these words in the Court, before his house, but there rushes in upon them a great number of rebells, who stabd Mr <HI>Champion</HI> before he could get into his house: but their fury went further, for they wounded him with their Skeins in thirty places after he was dead, and then cut off his head while the rest ran into the house after Mr <HI>Iremonger,</HI> they fell upon him, and ran him thorow: Then the Rebells entered the house, and killed more, his wife's sister and her brother in law; his wife was down on her knees to beg a sheet, to put her hus∣bands dead body in.
