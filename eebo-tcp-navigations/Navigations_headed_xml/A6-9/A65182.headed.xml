<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Relations discovering <HI>some</HI> of
the richest Parts of the World, not yet
planted by the Europeans, and <HI>others</HI> but
little known, worthy the perusal of the Curi∣ous,
can hardly fail of a favourable Reception at this
Juncture; for of all the Blessings of Peace, none
appear more charming or profitable than Navigation
and Commerce, especially to the <HI>English Nation,</HI>
whose Genius is much bent upon Improvements at Sea,
and Plantations abroad, which bring great Riches
into the Kingdom, particularly those in <HI>America,</HI>
where the Spaniards by their ill Conduct have given
Opportunities to some of their Neighbours to put in for
a share of the Wealth and Trade of that vast Tract
of Land.</P>
<P>The frequent Sacking of their Towns and seizing
of their Ships by the <HI>English, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
put <HI>Philip the Third</HI> upon searching out new ways
of transporting the Treasures of <HI>Peru, Chili,</HI> and
<HI>Granada</HI> into <HI>Spain;</HI> to which end (the Coasts about,
and in the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> being as well known as
those in <HI>Europe</HI>) Orders were dispatched from the
Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> to the Governours of <HI>Brazil</HI> and
<HI>Peru</HI> to attempt the Navigation of the great River of
AMAZONS, that if 'twere found practicable,
the <HI>Gold, Silver,</HI> and other Merchandizes of <HI>Pe∣ru</HI>
and the adjacent Countries might be safely and
commodiously sent down to <HI>Para</HI> to be put on board
the Galleons, which would lie less expos'd there, than
at <HI>Cartagena, Porto Belo,</HI> or <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> the
Soundings of the Mouth of that River being un∣known,
and dangerous to Strangers. What Essays
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
were made pursuant to these Instructions, is best seen
by the first Chapters of the ensuing Relation of <HI>F.
Chr. d' Acugna,</HI> to which the Reader is referr'd,
as the true Journal of the only Voyage upon, and
Discovery of that noble River from the Source to the
Mouth: 'twere needless to offer any other Recommen∣dation
of the Work, except some Account of the Author.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nat. Sotvelli Bibliothec. Scriptor. Societ. Jesu. Romae, 1677. Fol.</NOTE> <HI>Christopher d' Acugna</HI> was born at <HI>Burgos</HI> in
<HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 1597. and entred into the Society of
Jesus at 15 Years of Age. After some Years spent
in Study, he went into <HI>America,</HI> and was Rector of
the Jesuits College at <HI>Cuence</HI> under the Jurisdiction
of <HI>Quito,</HI> when <HI>Peter Texeira</HI> the Portuguez Gene∣ral
came thither from <HI>Para</HI> in <HI>Brazil</HI> up the River of
<HI>Amazons.</HI> The Viceroy of <HI>Peru</HI> ordered our Author
to embark with <HI>Texeira</HI> (who return'd by the same
way he came) and to inform himself exactly in his
Voyage of every thing that might enable him to give
a satisfactory Account of the <HI>Amazone</HI> to the K. of
<HI>Spain.</HI> Accordingly they departed from <HI>Quito Jan.</HI>
16. 1639. and arriv'd at <HI>Para Dec.</HI> 12. following.
Thence he went into <HI>Spain,</HI> and presented to the King
his Master an ample Relation of the said River;
which was published at <HI>Madrid</HI> in 1641, and entitu∣led

which occasion'd the Loss of all <HI>Brazil,</HI> and the Colo∣ny

from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were the Cause of this Relation
being suppress'd both in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> lest being
of no use to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the <HI>Portuguez</HI> might make
too great Advantages of it: Thus the Copies of it
became so scarce, that the Editor of the French
Translation says, there was not one single Book any
where to be had, except that the Translator (M. <HI>Gom∣berville</HI>
of the French Academy) made use of, and
perhaps there might be another in the <HI>Vatican Libra∣ry;</HI>
for <HI>Philip the Fourth</HI> had taken all possible care
to get and destroy most of the printed Copies in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
and the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Description de la Riviere &amp; Pais des Amazones per M. Le Comte de Pagan 12<SUP>o</SUP>, <HI>Paris</HI> 1655.</NOTE> In the Year 1655 the <HI>Count de Pagan,</HI> Master
of the Artillery, presented to <HI>Mazarine</HI> Proposals for
conquering and planting this great River; but the
<HI>Cardinal</HI> being involv'd in Domestick Troubles, was
not at leisure to push on the Enterprize, tho it had been
first started by that eminent Minister himself. This
Discourse of <HI>Monsieur de Pagan</HI> is extracted for the
most part out of <HI>Acugna,</HI> and is a sort of Para∣phrase
upon him, full of Digressions, and not com∣parable
to the Original it self, which is more uniform
and authentick, containing abundance of remarkable
Observations, not mentioned by <HI>Pagan</HI> nor any other
Copist whatsoever. The <HI>Cardinal</HI> was once resolv'd
to plant five several Colonies; the first in the <HI>Isle of
the Sun,</HI> to guard the best Entrance into the Mouth
of the <HI>Amazone;</HI> the second on the <HI>Bosphore</HI> or
<HI>Strait,</HI> to keep the Passage; the third on the Points of
the <HI>Rio Negro;</HI> the fourth on the <HI>Zuanes</HI> near the
Golden Mines; the last on the Mouth of the <HI>Marag∣non,</HI>
to watch over the Spanish Frontiers on that side
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
of the <HI>Andes:</HI> This was the Plan of his Design.
The many Difficulties of entring the Mouth, and
getting into the true Channel of this River of <HI>A∣mazons,</HI>
have often discouraged the <HI>Spaniards,
English,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> from attempting to trade in it,
whereas upon Practice and Experience it might prove
as navigable as most of the great Rivers of the World,
whose Mouths are generally encumbred either with
Sands, Flats, Isles, or impetuous Currents, which
after a few Trials become familiar. The way pro∣pounded
to the <HI>Cardinal</HI> was this. First shun the
strong Currents, by passing aside into 2 Degrees of
South Latitude; then steer up agen by the Coast of
<HI>Brazil</HI> at 30 min. South Lat. double the Point of
<HI>Zaparara,</HI> and sail to the South-west; after that
follow the Coast of the Province of <HI>Para,</HI> and pass
the Channel of the <HI>Isle of the Sun</HI> at 1 Deg. 15 Min.
South Lat. and 26 Leagues from the main Sea; last∣ly,
sail Westward, leave the side of <HI>Para,</HI> and keep
the same Latitude to gain the Bank-side of <HI>Curupa,</HI>
and there enter into the best Road of this River at 2
deg. S. Lat. and 30 Leagues beyond <HI>Curupa,</HI> which
is but 1 deg. 30 min. on the same side of the Line.</P>
<P>Since that time the <HI>French</HI> being Masters of the
<HI>Isle of Cayenne</HI> (which they have fortified and cul∣tivated)
to the North of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> have not
(nor any other Nation that we know of) planted any
Countrey on this River, but have contented themselves
with making Journeys into <HI>Guiana,</HI> particularly in
search of the vast Lake of <HI>Parima,</HI> which the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
have long fancied to be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lopez de Gomara, <HI>also</HI> Hakluyt, <HI>and</HI> Purchas <HI>in their Collections concerning</HI> Guiana.</NOTE> the richest Place in
the World, calling it the Kingdom of <HI>Dorado,</HI> whither
all the great Families of <HI>Peru</HI> retir'd, and built the
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>
Golden City of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herrera,</HI> and <HI>John de Laet</HI> speak doubtfully of these places.</NOTE> <HI>Manoa.</HI> What grounds the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
went upon in their Attempts to find out these
Places at a mighty Expence of Blood and Treasure,
will best appear by the following Travels of <HI>M. Grillet</HI>
and <HI>Bechamel,</HI> who went beyond the suppos'd Lon∣gitudes
of these Places, and could not learn the
least Tidings of them from any of the <HI>Indian
Nations,</HI> tho the Circumference of the <HI>Lake</HI> alone
is generally reckon'd to be above 1500 Miles. 'Tis
true, some may object that this doth not wholly de∣stroy
the common <HI>Geography</HI> of that Country, and
give this plausible Argument, that the simple innocent
Indians are grown so extremely sensible of the cruel
Dispositions of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> that they begin now to
conceal industriously every thing from them, and lead
them out of the way, lest they should fix in their Coun∣try
and exercise their Barbarities over them;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barth. de las Casas (obispo de las Chiapas) Hist. dela destrucion de los Indios, Venet. 1630. <HI>Also</HI> Hist. novi orbis per Hier. Benzon. <HI>And the</HI> Comment. Reales delos Yncas, Reyes del Peru. fol.</NOTE> for by

fertile, the Rivers overflowing every Year upon
the Stationary Rains, as the <HI>Amazone</HI> and <HI>Ore∣noque</HI>
in <HI>Guiana,</HI> and as the <HI>Nile</HI> and the <HI>Niger</HI>
in <HI>Africa.</HI> Since then the Spaniards have been possest
of this part of <HI>America,</HI> and no Strangers have
pass'd up this River to <HI>Potosi</HI> to give us any exact
Relation thereof; this of <HI>M. Acarete</HI> is the latest,
and much more copious and particular than that of
<HI>Martin del Barco,</HI> or the Dutch Journal translated
from a Manuscript by <HI>J. de Laet</HI> in his <HI>Hist. Ind.</HI>
besides, what is here related by <HI>Acarete</HI> of the Mines
of <HI>Potosi</HI> is wholly new, and merits our notice.
The way he went seems to be a shorter and a safer
Passage to and from the Mines of <HI>Potosi</HI> than that
usually practis'd by <HI>Arica, Lima, Panama</HI> and <HI>Porto-Belo,</HI>
especially now the <HI>Boucaniers</HI> are so well ac∣quainted

given a pretty good reason why the Spaniards don't
open a Trade that way.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Country in which the River of Ama∣zons
is situated. Of its Reputation, and
of the first Discoveries the Spaniards made
of it.</HEAD>
<P>THE Spaniards were no sooner be∣come
Masters of that Part of
<HI>America,</HI> which is now called
<HI>Peru,</HI> but they extremely desir'd
to make a Discovery of the great River
of <HI>Amazons,</HI> which some Geographers
through a vulgar Error have call'd the
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
River of <HI>Maragnon.</HI> They were induc'd
to attempt this not only by the Account
they had receiv'd of the Fertility of the
Soil, and of the Riches of the People a∣long
that famous River, but also because
they had very good Reasons to believe
that it took its Course from the West to
the East, and that receiving all the Rivers
that descend from the Mountains of <HI>Peru,</HI>
it was a kind of Canal through which
there was a Passage from the Southern to
the Northern Sea. Upon these Conjec∣tures
some Persons undertook to go in
search of this River, but to no purpose.
Others afterward made the like Essay, but
with no better Success. At length in the
Year 1539. <HI>Gonzalles Pizarre</HI> being made
Governor of the Province of <HI>Quito</HI> by the
Marquess <HI>Francis Pizarre</HI> his Brother, who
was Governor of <HI>Peru,</HI> put himself in an
Equipage to go to his Government, and
from thence to pass on to the Conquest of
the Country of <HI>Cannelle.</HI> He got together
two hundred Foot and a hundred Horse,
partly at his own Charge, and partly at
the Expence of some that accompanied him
in this Expedition, which cost
above fifty thousand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Castillan is about 5 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI> English.</NOTE> Castil∣lans
of Gold. Being arriv'd
at <HI>Quito,</HI> he order'd all necessa∣ry
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Provisions to be made for his Journey,
took a great number of Indian Slaves to
carry the Baggage, and set forward at
the end of <HI>December</HI> in the Year 1539,
with four hundred Spaniards and four
thousand Indians. He order'd for the
Subsistence of his Men four thousand
Sheep, Cows, and Swine to be driven
along with 'em; and taking his Course
directly Northward, he enter'd into the
Country of the <HI>Quixos,</HI> where the Con∣quests
of the <HI>Yncas</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> ended. This
Province is forty Leagues in length, and
twenty in breadth; and was inhabited by
a People that never us'd to dwell together
in Towns or Villages like those of <HI>Peru,</HI>
but liv'd in a straggling manner scatter'd
up and down the Country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The way Gonzalles Pizarre took in passing
out of Quito, and the Difficulties he met
with in his Journey.</HEAD>
<P>THE March of our Adventurers was
retarded, not only by the Oppositi∣on
they had from the People of the Coun∣try,
who disputed their Passage, but also
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
by continual Rains and Earthquakes so
violent, that many Houses were over∣turn'd,
and deep Breaches made in the
Earth before 'em, together with such ter∣rible
Storms and Claps of Thunder, that
any one but <HI>Gonzalles Pizarre</HI> would have
abandon'd such an Enterprize as seem'd to
be oppos'd both by Heaven and Earth.
However he with his Men did not give
over their March for all this bad Weather,
but cross'd the Province of the <HI>Quixos,</HI>
till they came to the foot of some high
Mountains all cover'd with Snow, which
make a part of those which the Spaniards
call the <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and which bound the
Province of the <HI>Quixos</HI> on the North.
Tho the Rains still continued they re∣solv'd
to pass over the Mountains, but
were not far advanc'd before the Rain
turn'd into a Snow so thick and cold, that
many of the Indians were kill'd by it. The
Spaniards were likely to have undergone
the same fate, if they had continued their
March as they began: They concluded
that nothing but Expedition could save
'em from the Rigor of the Cold, and
therefore left all the Cattle they had with
them, and lighted themselves of the rest
of their Provisions and Baggage, hoping
they should find enough on t'other side of
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
the Mountains. When they were got

<HI>Zumaque,</HI> which is a hundred Leagues
from <HI>Quito</HI> by the account of good Geo∣graphers;
there they found abundance of
Provisions and Refreshments, and conti∣nued
there two Months to acquaint them∣selves
with the Country, and to see if
they could make any advantage of it.
But this Place not answering the great
hopes they had conceiv'd of their Adven∣ture,
<HI>Pizarre</HI> parted from <HI>Zumaque</HI> with
sixty good Souldiers to discover the Coun∣try
of <HI>Cannelle;</HI> but in pursuing the Course
he had taken towards the North, he
found the way so rough and mountainous,
that he was constrain'd to change his
Road; he therefore turn'd directly to the
East, and after some few days march, en∣ter'd
into that famous Country call'd by
the Inhabitants <HI>Cannelle,</HI> from certain great
Trees, like Olive-Trees, that are call'd so
in that Place.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Countries near the River of Amazons
discover'd by Gonzalles Pizarre.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HErrera</HI> the Spanish Historian says,
<HI>Pizarre</HI> exercis'd the greatest Cru∣elty
imaginable on the Inhabitants of these
Regions, insomuch that he gave Men to
be eaten alive by his Dogs. This en∣gag'd
all the Country to put themselves
in Arms against him, so that he was
oblig'd to encamp himself as in an Ene∣my's
Country: And his Cruelties, toge∣ther
with the Despair he was in of ever
being able to find what he was seeking
after, had like to have put an end to his
Enterprize at once. He was encamp'd
on the Bank of a River, which swell'd
so much in one Night, that if the Senti∣nels,
who perceiv'd the Water was apace
getting ground of 'em, had not warn'd
'em of their Danger, they had been all
drown'd; but at the Alarm they gave 'em
they soon secur'd themselves by making
towards the Cottages of the wild People,
and <HI>Pizarre</HI> resolv'd to return to <HI>Zuma∣que,</HI>
not knowing what other course to
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
take. From thence he proceeded again
with all his Men, and after a March of
four Leagues, he met with a great Vil∣lage
call'd <HI>Ampua,</HI> govern'd by a <HI>Cacique,</HI>
and found a great number of the Inha∣bitants
in a posture of Defence expecting
their Enemy. But there was another and
a greater Obstacle in his way than this
<HI>Cacique</HI> and all his Troops, and that was
a River so wide and deep, that he could
have no thoughts of venturing to swim
over it. He could therefore find no bet∣ter
Expedient than to enter into a Treaty
with the People of the Country, and to
desire the help of their Canoos to cross
this River. The <HI>Cacique</HI> receiv'd this
Proposal with great Civility, offer'd 'em
what they ask'd, and gave 'em as many
of those little Boats as they desir'd, and
<HI>Pizarre</HI> made 'em a return of a great ma∣ny
little Spanish Toys by way of Re∣quital.
This <HI>Cacique</HI> having receiv'd Ad∣vice
of the ill Treatment many of his
Neighbours had receiv'd from the Spa∣niards,
thought of nothing more than
how to get rid of them: And to deliver
himself from the danger of the Compa∣ny
of such bad Guests, endeavour'd to
make 'em believe there were great Riches
to be found among the People that dwelt
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
upon this River some days Journey lower.
<HI>Pizarre</HI> both by his Actions, and by the
Mouth of his Guides, who were his In∣terpreters,
return'd him Thanks for his
Courtesy: but finding no appearance of
those pretended Riches, he return'd to
<HI>Zumaque,</HI> very much dissatisfied with his
Expedition. However, he had too much
Courage to return back to <HI>Quito</HI> just as
he came; he had a mind therefore to at∣tempt
some great Exploit, and by the
Discovery of some other <HI>Peru,</HI> to render
himself as considerable as the Marquess
of <HI>Pizarre</HI> his elder Brother: He open'd
his Mind to <HI>Francis Oreillane,</HI> a Gentleman
of <HI>Truxillo</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> who was come to
join him in the Valley of <HI>Zumaque</HI> with
fifty Troopers well appointed: He very
much encourag'd his Design; and tho the
Rainy Season was not yet past, that did
not hinder him from advancing forward;
he left his little Army at <HI>Zumaque,</HI> and
having taken a hundred effective Soul∣diers,
and some Indians for Guides, and
to carry Provisions, he march'd directly
to the East.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The first News he receiv'd of this famous
River, and of the Riches of the People
that dwell near it.</HEAD>
<P>EIther the Ignorance of his Guides, or
the Hatred they bare him engaged
him in a Country all full of Mountains,
Forests and Torrents, so that he was ne∣cessitated
to make Ways where he found
none, and to open himself a Passage through
the Woods with Hatchets, where none had
ever gone before. At length after many
days March he pierc'd through as far as
the Province of <HI>Coca.</HI> The <HI>Cacique</HI> of
which Province came before him, and of∣fer'd
him all the Accommodations the
Country afforded for his Refreshment.
<HI>Gonzalles</HI> promis'd himself much from this
kind Entertainment, and by the Assistance
of his Guides enter'd into Conversation
with the <HI>Cacique.</HI> He inform'd him that
the Country through which he had pass'd,
which was so full of Mountains, Forests
and Brooks, was the only Passage he could
have taken to come thither; that it was
extremely difficult to get through it, but
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
that if he were willing to embark on the
River he saw before him, or to follow it by
Land, he might assure himself, that along
the Banks of another River much greater
than this, he should find a Country a∣bounding
with all things, whose Inha∣bitants
were cover'd with Plates of Gold.
There was no need of saying any thing
more to <HI>Pizarre</HI> to incite him to any kind
of Enterprize; who presently sent two of
his Guides to <HI>Zumaque</HI> with Orders to his
Officers to come and join him, who march'd
immediately, and surmounting all the Dif∣ficulties
of the way, arriv'd much fatigued
to the Town of <HI>Coca. Pizarre</HI> having
rested 'em some few days, and after∣wards
put them in Battalia before the
<HI>Cacique,</HI> who was much terrified at them;
he amass'd almost all the Provisions of
his whole Province to make a Present of
them to <HI>Pizarre,</HI> that by this Magnifi∣cence
he might civilly acquit himself of
his new Acquaintance, who was more
impatient of his stay than the other; and
the next Morning having filed his Troops
along the River, he took his leave of
the <HI>Cacique,</HI> presenting him with a fine
Sword, and put himself at the head of
his Cavalry, and followed the pleasant
Course of the River. This good way
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
did not last long, but they had Rivulets
to swim over, must go up-hill and down-hill
in uneven ways, and march forty
three days without finding any Provision
for his Troops, or any Fords or Canoos
by which to pass the River.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Discovery which Pizarre made of the
River of Coca, and Oreillane's floating
on this River by Pizarre's order, and so
entering into the River of Amazons.</HEAD>
<P>THis long March having mightily
fatigued our Travellers, they were
stop'd by a very surprizing sight: The
River was press'd by two Rocks, one
on each side its Passage, at no more than
twenty foot distance from one another;
and the Water going through this Strait,
precipitated it self into a Valley, and
made a Leap of two hundred Fathom.
Here it was that <HI>Pizarre</HI> caus'd that fa∣mous
Bridg to be made for his Troops
to pass over, which is so much boasted
of by the Spanish Historians. But find∣ing
the Way not at all better on the
other side, and their Provision growing
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
more and more scarce every day, <HI>Pizarre</HI>
resolv'd to make a Brigantine to carry
by Water all his sick Men, Provisions,
Baggage, and a hundred thousand Livres
in Gold which they had got amongst
'em. This was no small Difficulty, but
Industry and Necessity surmounted it;
and the Vessel being finished, <HI>Pizarre</HI> em∣bark'd
all in it that hindred his March,
and gave the Command of it to <HI>Francis
Oreillane</HI> with fifty Souldiers, giving him
express Order not to part far from him,
but to come every Night to the Camp.
He observ'd this Order exactly, till his
General seeing all his Men were much
pinch'd with Hunger, commanded him
to go and seek some Provisions and Cot∣tages,
where his Men might be refreshed.
<HI>Oreillane</HI> had no sooner receiv'd his Or∣ders,
but he launched out into the mid∣dle
of the River; and the Rapidity of
the Stream carry'd him as fast as he could
wish, for he made above a hundred
Leagues in three days without the use of
either Sails or Oars: The Current of
<HI>Coca</HI> carried him into another River
which was much larger, but nothing
near so swift; he made his Observation of
it one whole day, and seeing that the
farther he went down, the more the Ri∣ver
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
widen'd, he did not doubt but this
was that great River which had been so
often and in vain sought after. The Joy
he conceiv'd at his good Fortune so trans∣ported
him, that it made him quite forget
himself; so that he thought of nothing
but the Enjoyment of this good Suc∣cess;
and trampling upon his Duty, Oath, Fide∣lity
and Gratitude, he had now nothing in
view but how to bring about the Enter∣prize
he was contriving.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Oreillane hoping for an extraordinary Success
from the Discovery of this River; and
being willing to have the sole Glory of it,
leaves his General, and makes himself the
Head of this Enterprize.</HEAD>
<P>TO this end <HI>Oreillane</HI> perswaded his
Companions that the Country whi∣ther
they were arriv'd, was not the same
with that which their General had de∣scribed;
that it had not that great Plenty
the <HI>Cacique</HI> had told him he should find
at the joining of the two Rivers; that
they must certainly float along farther
to find that pleasant and fertile Coun∣try,
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
where they might store themselves
with Provisions; and besides that, they
all saw there was no likelihood of getting
up this River again, which indeed they
came down in three days, but, as he be∣liev'd,
could not make the same way
back again in the space of a whole Year;
that it was much more reasonable to wait
for their Company on this new River,
and that in the mean time it was necessa∣ry
for 'em to go seek Provisions. Thus
concealing his Design, he hoisted up the
Sails, and abandoning himself to the
Wind, to his Fortune, and to his Reso∣lution,
he thought of nothing but of pur∣suing
the course of the River, till he
should discover it quite to the Sea. His
Companions were startled at the manner
of his putting in execution the Design he
had been proposing to 'em, and thought
themselves oblig'd to tell him that he
went beyond the Orders of his General;
and that in the extreme want he was in,
they ought to carry him the little Provi∣sion
they could find; and that he had
given sufficient Evidence that he had some
ill Design, because he had neglected to
leave two Canoos at the Bank of the two
Rivers, as the General had appointed him,
for his Army to pass over in. These Re∣monstrances
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
were made to him chiefly by
a Dominican Frier nam'd <HI>Gaspard de Car∣vajal,</HI>
and by a young Gentleman of
<HI>Badajos</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> call'd <HI>Fernand Sanches
de Vargas.</HI> The Consideration they had
for these two Persons occasion'd a Divi∣sion
of the Company in this little Vessel
into two Parties; and from Words they
were like to have fallen to Blows, but
that <HI>Oreillane</HI> stifling their Gratitude by his
Dissimulation, by fair Protestations and
great Promises appeas'd this Disorder.
By means of the Friends he had in the
Vessel he gain'd most of the Souldiers that
were against him to his side; and seeing
the two Heads of the other Party left
almost alone, he caus'd <HI>Fernand Sanches de
Vargas</HI> to be set ashore, leaving him quite
alone, without Victuals and without
Arms, in a dismal Wilderness, bounded on
one side with high Mountains, and with a
River on the other: He had more Pru∣dence
than to treat the Frier after the
same manner, yet he gave him to under∣stand,
that it was not for him to pene∣trate
any more into the Pretensions of his
Commander, unless he had a mind to be
severely chastis'd: After this he continued
his Voyage; and the next day being wil∣ling
to know if he might depend upon
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
all that were with him for the success
of his Resolutions, he let 'em know that
he aspir'd to a much higher pitch of Dig∣nity
than what he might have obtain'd
in the Service of <HI>Pizarre,</HI> that he ow'd
every thing to himself and his King; and
that his Fortune having as it were led
him by the hand, to the greatest and
most desirable Discovery that was ever
made in the <HI>Indies,</HI> namely, the great
River upon which they were sailing,
which coming out of <HI>Peru,</HI> and running
from West to East, was the finest Channel
in the new World, through which one
might pass from the Northern to the
Southern Sea: that he could not without
betraying them all, and without ravish∣ing
from them the Fruits of their Voy∣age
and Industry, make others share in a
Favour which Heaven had reserv'd for
them alone. That as for himself, his De∣sign
was to go into <HI>Spain,</HI> to beg of his
Catholick Majesty the Government of this
great Country all along this noble Ri∣ver;
he promis'd them they should be all
Governours of Castles and Towns, and
have other Recompences proportionate to
their Valour and Generosity; that they
should only follow him; that they knew
him well; that he was not uncapable of the
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
Post he design'd to ask of the King, and
that it was certainly due to him for
having made a Discovery of the Country.
That as for the Oath he had taken to
<HI>Pizarre,</HI> he disingag'd himself of it; that
he was resolv'd to be commanded by him
no longer; that he renounc'd the Power he
had receiv'd from him, and would have
no other Authority nor Command but
what he ask'd of them, and what they
would give him in naming him chief
Commander, under the King their Master,
in the Discovery of this great River.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Oreillane gives his Name to this River.
The Change of the Name he had given it
by a Fable himself compos'd, to render his
Discovery the more famous.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Harangue was followed with a
general Consent to make him the
Head of this Enterprize. He began to
use his Authority in giving his Name to
this great and famous River, and not con∣tent
to know the course of it, he was de∣sirous
of discovering the Country it wa∣ter'd.
He therefore went ashore to get</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"/>
Provisions, and to acquaint himself with
the Inhabitants: But he found the Peo∣ple
able to defend their Bread, and had se∣veral
Battels with the Natives, who let
him know they were not without Cou∣rage;
nay, they were so stout and reso∣lute
in the defence of their Country, that
the Women mix'd themselves with the
Men in the Battel, and seconded them
with admirable Bravery both in shooting
of Arrows, and in standing their Ground.
'Twas this that gave occasion to <HI>Oreillane,</HI>
that he might render his Discovery more
considerable and glorious, to tell that he
had enter'd into a Country of vast Extent
along this River, which was govern'd by
<HI>Amazons,</HI> a sort of Women who had no
Husbands, who destroy'd all their Male-Children;
and who came arm'd at a cer∣tain
time every Year in a Body to the
Frontiers of their Neighbours, there to
choose themselves Paramours, to prevent
the Extinction of so extraordinary a Nati∣on:
And this was the reason why this Ri∣ver
he had first call'd after his own Name,
was since call'd the River of <HI>Amazons.</HI>
However <HI>Oreillane</HI> pursued his Course
with a great deal of Success, and the more
he advanc'd, the more all things seem'd
to concur to prosper his Infidelity. As he
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>
went farther down, he found other People,
not so warlike and savage as the others:
They receiv'd him with a great deal of
Civility, and admir'd all that he and his
Company did, and all that they had, their
Persons, their Clothes, their Arms, their
Vessel, and every thing else: They look'd
upon 'em as a sort of extraordinary Men,
were willing to enter into an amicable
Treaty with 'em, and gave 'em as much
Provision as they could desire.</P>

set sail. After several days Voyage, he
happily came to the place where this Ri∣ver

with it; and taking good notice of the
Places necessary to be observ'd for his Re∣turn,
he coasted along a Cape, now call'd

Island <HI>La Trinidada,</HI> and sail'd directly thi∣ther,
where he bought a Vessel, in which

His Dispatches were soon given, but the
execution of 'em was very tedious; for
he was above seven Years at the Court of
<HI>Spain</HI> before he could put himself in a
condition to sail. About the end of the
Year 1549, he imbark'd with all his
Men; but was no sooner got to the Lati∣tude

<PB N="21" REF="17"/>
Distemper passing from one of his Vessels

it, and came to the Mouth of it with his
Vessels; but finding he wanted Men, he
order'd 'em all to come aboard his own
Ship, and quitted the two others. But the
number of his Men daily diminishing,
having built two Barks in an Island where
he had made some stay, he only reserv'd
himself one of them, of a pretty large
size, and several times attempted to get
up higher into the River. He was, in fine,
necessitated to yield to his Fortune, which
had forsaken him, and suffer'd him to go
to the place of his Ruin. He was cast on
the Coasts of <HI>Caracas,</HI> and from thence

<P>THE ill Success of <HI>Oreillane</HI>'s Voyage

nam'd <HI>Peter de Orsua,</HI> who had always en∣tertain'd
Thoughts worthy of his great
Courage, turn'd his Designs on this great
River, and believ'd he should be more
fortunate than <HI>Oreillane:</HI> He presented him∣self
to the Vice-Roy, and propos'd his
Design to him; who being well acquainted
with his Merit, commended his Resolu∣tion,
and was perswaded, that if so diffi∣cult
a matter should succeed, it must be

all necessary Orders for him, and caus'd a

who was so much in every one's

His chief trouble was to return his Thanks
to so many of 'em as he could not take
along with him: he made choice of such
amongst 'em as were most fit for his pur∣pose;
and to carry on the famous Conquest
he design'd, he made all necessary Provi∣sions
both of Ammunition and Victuals, to

<P>ONE would have hop'd an Attempt
so wisely laid, and so universally ap∣prov'd,
should have had a happy Issue:
Yet never was any Project more unsuccess∣ful;
for <HI>Orsua</HI> had taken with him one <HI>Don
Fernand de Gusman,</HI> a young Man who was
lately come from <HI>Spain,</HI> and another more
advanc'd in Years, named <HI>Lopez Daguirre</HI>
of <HI>Biscay,</HI> a little ill-favour'd Man, whom
he had made his Ensign. These two
Wretches fell in Love with their General's
Lady, whose Name was <HI>Agnes,</HI> and who
had accompanied her Husband in all his
Travels; and thinking they had a favou∣rable
occasion to satisfy their Lust and Am∣bition
together, engag'd <HI>Orsua</HI>'s Troops to
revolt, and assassinated him. After this
Tragical Fact the Traitors who commit∣ted
it, who to the number of seven or
eight were in a strict Confederacy, elected
<PB N="25" REF="19"/>
<HI>Don Fernand de Gusman</HI> for their King;
whose Mind was vain enough to receive
that Title which became him so little: But
he did not enjoy it long; for those very
Persons that had given him the Quality of
King, gave him his Death's Wound too,
and <HI>Daguirre</HI> succeeded him, who made
himself King, notwithstanding the Re∣monstrances
of others: And naming him∣self
the Rebel and Traitor, he gave all those
he had gain'd to his Party to understand,
that he intended to make himself Master
of <HI>Guiana,</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> and of the new King∣dom
of <HI>Grenada,</HI> and promis'd 'em all the
Riches of those great Kingdoms. His
Reign was so bloody and barbarous, that
the like Tyranny was scarce ever heard of
in the World: Therefore the Spaniards to
this day call him the Tyrant. However
he commanded <HI>Orsua</HI>'s Vessels, and went
down the River <HI>Coca</HI> into the <HI>Amazone,</HI>
hoping to obtain one of those Kingdoms,
and to make a considerable Progress into it.
But having enter'd the <HI>Amazone,</HI> he was
not able to master the Current of it, and
so was constrained to suffer himself to be
carried down to the Mouth of a River a∣bove
a thousand Leagues from the place
where he imbark'd, and was driven in∣to
the great Channel which goes to the
<PB N="26" REF="20"/>

had taken before him. Going out of the
<HI>Amazone,</HI> he came to the Island of St. <HI>Mar∣guerite,</HI>
which is to this day call'd the Ty∣rant's
Port; there he kill'd <HI>Don Irean de
Villa Andrada,</HI> Governour of the Island,
and <HI>Don John Sermiento</HI> his Father. After
their Death, with the Assistance of one
<HI>John Burq,</HI> he made himself Master of
the Island, plunder'd it intirely, and there
committed unheard-of Barbarities. He
kill'd all that oppos'd him, and past from
thence to <HI>Cumana,</HI> where he exercis'd the
same Cruelties: He after that desolated all
those Coasts that bear the Name of <HI>Ca∣racas,</HI>
and all the Provinces along the Ri∣vers
<HI>Venezuella</HI> and <HI>Baccho.</HI> He then came
to St. <HI>Martha,</HI> where he put all to the
Sword, and enter'd the new Kingdom of
<HI>Grenada,</HI> designing to march from thence
through <HI>Quito</HI> into <HI>Peru.</HI> In this King∣dom
he was forc'd to a Battel, in which he
was utterly defeated, and put to flight, but

<P>He had a Daughter by his Wife <HI>Mendo∣za,</HI>

thou shouldst live to suffer the Shame
of becoming a Slave to my Enemies, and
of being call'd the Daughter of a Tyrant

the Hand of thy Father, if thou hast not
Courage enough to die by thy own. She
surpriz'd at this Discourse, desir'd him at
least to give her some time to prepare for
Death, and to beg of God the Pardon of
her Sins: This he granted; but thinking
her too tedious in her Devotion, as she
was praying upon her Knees he shot her
through the Body with a Carbine; but
having not kill'd her out-right, he stuck
his Dagger into her Heart. She falling

<HEAD TYPE="sub">This Discovery by these sad Accidents conti∣nued
thus without any farther Advance∣ment,
from the Year 1560 to 1606, when
two Jesuits ventur'd to go and preach the
Gospel along this River, and were there
martyr'd. Many other Attempts form'd
since by great Persons without Success.</HEAD>
<P>THE unhappy Issue of these two En∣terprizes
abated the Desires of o∣thers
after this Discovery to that degree,
that the last Age past without any farther
knowledg of this great River: But our
Age has been more happy, and we have
seen this great Design perfectly executed
in our days. In 1606, and 1607, two
Fathers of the Jesuits Society mov'd with
the desire of the Conversion of those
barbarous People, went from <HI>Quito,</HI> and
pierc'd as far as the Province of the <HI>Co∣fanes,</HI>
who inhabit those Parts where the
Springs of the River <HI>Coca</HI> rise. Those
good Fathers were willing to begin the
Publication of the Gospel among these
People: But the Hour of their being call'd
to the Knowledg of God was not yet
<PB N="29" REF="21"/>
come; for they found these Men so cruel,
and so uncapable of hearing the Word,
that they kill'd one of these Fathers nam'd
<HI>Raphael Ferrier,</HI> and made the other fly
for his Life.</P>
<P>In the Year 1621. under the Reign of
<HI>Philip</HI> IV. King of <HI>Spain, Vincent Delos
Reyes de Villalobos,</HI> Serjeant-Major, Gover∣nor
and Captain-General of the Country
of the <HI>Quixos,</HI> resolv'd to attempt the
Navigation of the River <HI>Amazone;</HI> but
receiving an Order to quit his Govern∣ment,
he was oblig'd to lay aside the
thoughts of this Adventure. <HI>Alonze Mi∣randa</HI>
form'd the same Design, prepar'd his
Equipage, and took all necessary Precau∣tions
to overcome all the Difficulties of
the Attempt, but had no better success
than the others, for he dy'd without ha∣ving
so much as seen this famous River.
Before either of these two the General
<HI>Joseph de Villamayor Maldonado</HI> Governor
of the <HI>Quixos,</HI> incited by the same Mo∣tives
of the Glory of God, the Grandure
of the King his Master, and the Salvation
of so many Infidels, had consum'd all he

<P>THE Spaniards were not the only

that expressed so earnest a desire to render
themselves Masters of those unknown Na∣tions.
The <HI>Portuguez</HI> were no less eager
in the same Design, and knowing they
were not far distant from the Mouth of the
River, they were willing to believe this
Discovery was reserv'd for them. In the
Year 1626, <HI>Bonito Macul</HI> then Governour

III. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to put to Sea with

Majesty, being call'd away by others more
pressing, which oblig'd him to go into the
King's Service at <HI>Phernambuc.</HI></P>
<P>In 1633, and 1634. the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
being extremely impatient to see that En∣terprize
at last succeed, which had so ma∣ny
<PB N="31" REF="22"/>
times been in vain attempted, sent very
pressing Orders to <HI>Francesco Coello</HI> Gover∣nor

of <HI>Para,</HI> to arm a considerable Force to
attempt an effectual Discovery of this
River: And directed him in his Orders, in
case he had no Officer near him upon
whose Conduct he could depend for the
execution of this Design, to go in Person
himself, because he was resolv'd absolutely
to know whether it were impossible to go
up this River, and to find the Source of
it, and consequently its length. <HI>Carvallo</HI>
could not obey the King his Master, be∣cause
he did not think himself in a Con∣dition
to absent himself from his Govern∣ment,
and to divide his Forces at a time
when he expected to be attacked by the
Dutch, who were unwilling to lose any
opportunity of making their Descents in∣to
<HI>Brazil:</HI> But what he did not think
feasible, without the help of a good num∣ber
of Men and Vessels, was happily ac∣complished
by the good Fortune of two
Lay-Friers of the Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI>
after the following manner.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">That which so many brave Men were not able
to perform, was accomplish'd by two Lay-Friers
of the Order of St. Francis, who
escaped the hands of the Indians.</HEAD>
<P>THE Town of St. <HI>Francis</HI> in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Quito</HI> is one of the finest
in <HI>America;</HI> it is built upon one of those
stupendous Mountains, which the Spa∣niards
call <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and <HI>Tierras,</HI> half a
degree South of the Equinoctial Line; yet
is it of the most agreeable Temperature,
and the most plentiful and healthful Place
in all <HI>Peru,</HI> and is never incommoded by
excessive Heat. In 1635, 1636, and 1637,
Captain <HI>John de Palacios</HI> having under∣taken
to attempt the Discovery of this Ri∣ver,
to that end made a small Provision of
Arms, desiring rather to acquaint himself
with the Country, and to people it, than
to subdue the Inhabitants of those Pro∣vinces
by force of Arms. Several Monks
of the Order of St. <HI>Francis</HI> were desirous
to accompany him to essay the Conversion
of these Barbarians, and promis'd them∣selves
more Success in this Work than the
<PB N="33" REF="23"/>
Jesuits had, who 30 Years before had made
the like Attempt, till they saw one of their
number Father <HI>Raphael Ferrier</HI> martyr'd
by these Infidels, as above related.</P>
<P>These march'd with more Precaution,
and after a long Fatigue arriv'd at the
Province of the long-hair'd Indians: This
Country they found well peopled, but not
being able to make any Establishment here
by reason of the rough Treatment they
met with from the Inhabitants, some of
them gave over the Attempt, and return'd
to <HI>Quito,</HI> but others were more resolute,
and continued with Captain <HI>de Palacios,</HI>
together with some few Souldiers that were
always faithful to him: But these being
almost all destroy'd in several Battels, in
one of which at last the Captain himself
was kill'd, the Monks made their Escape as
well as they could, and the two Lay-Friers
we have spoken of, one of whom was <HI>Do∣minic
de Britto,</HI> and the other <HI>Andrew de
Tolede,</HI> dexterously sav'd themselves from
the hands of the Indians; and having got
to their Bark, with six Souldiers that re∣main'd,
abandon'd themselves to Provi∣dence,
and suffer'd their Bark to be driven
at the Pleasure of the Winds and Streams.</P>
<P>It pleas'd God so to favour their Voy∣age,
that after they had been carried from
<PB N="34" REF="24"/>
Province to Province upon this great Ri∣ver,
they happily landed at <HI>Para,</HI> a City
in <HI>Brazil,</HI> forty Leagues distant from the
Mouth of the <HI>Amazone</HI> Southward. The
<HI>Portuguez</HI> possess it, and have made it a
good Garison, belonging to the Govern∣ment
of <HI>Maragnon.</HI> The two Lay-Friers
and the Souldiers were inquir'd of about
their long and strange Voyage, but they
were all eight of 'em so stupid, that they
had made no particular Remark on any
thing; only they said they had pass'd
through divers Provinces of different Bar∣barians,
who eat the Men which they
take in War. The two <HI>Cordeliers</HI> offer'd
to return to the place from whence they
came, provided they might have a Vessel
and Men granted 'em to conduct 'em,
hoping they should again find the same
Passages of the Rivers by which they came
down, and so get back again as far as
<HI>Quito.</HI> They were brought from <HI>Para</HI> to
the City of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> in <HI>Maragnon, James
Raimond de Norogna</HI> being then Governor
of that Place, who having a Zeal for the
Service of God, as well as that of the
King, was willing to examin these Corde∣lier
Friers more particularly than had been
done at <HI>Para.</HI> He discours'd 'em with so
much Patience and Sweetness, that he
<PB N="35" REF="24"/>
made 'em talk reasonably: They told him
they went from <HI>Peru,</HI> that their Monaste∣ry
was in the City of <HI>Quito;</HI> that they
came out with many of their Brethren to
labour to convert the wild People, but
that the Indians had a greater mind to eat
'em, than to hear 'em preach; that their
Captain being dead, and their Brethren put
to flight, they with six Souldiers had put
themselves into a Bark which miraculously
came ashore at <HI>Para;</HI> and that they were
ready to return to <HI>Peru,</HI> if they could meet
with a convenient Passage. The Gover∣nor
having deliberated on this Report,
believ'd God had offer'd him a fair occasion
to serve his Religion and his Country, and

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Governor of Brazil on the Report of

<P><HI>DOn Pedro de Norogna</HI> resolv'd to

and caus'd it to be publish'd: at this
News many offer'd themselves to serve on
this occasion. The Governor retain'd such
as he thought most proper for his Design;
and that he might have a Man capable of
giving him an exact account of all he should
see during so long a Voyage, he chose
Capt. <HI>Peter de Texeira,</HI> a Man of Courage,
Conduct, and Probity, to command the
Fleet. This Gentleman with a great deal
of Joy receiv'd a Command so sutable to
his Inclinations, for he had been all his Life
seeking occasions of serving his King to
the prejudice of his own private Interest,
and in the peril of his Life: and accord∣ing
to his desire he had the Glory of ac∣complishing
the most difficult, and most
illustrious Enterprize of his time. He
parted from <HI>Para</HI> the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>October</HI> 1637.
with forty seven Canoos of an indifferent
bigness, wherein besides Ammunition and
Victuals he embark'd seventy <HI>Portuguez</HI>
Souldiers, and twelve hundred Indians to
row and to bear Arms, who together with
their Wives and Servants made two thou∣sand
Persons: They enter'd into the mouth
of the River on that side that is nearest to
<HI>Para,</HI> and happily avoided those Rocks that
come just to the surface of the Water, and
stop the Passage of Vessels in many places.
<PB N="37" REF="25"/>
However they were almost a Year without
seeing the end of their Voyage: indeed
having no Guides upon whose Fidelity and
Experience they could depend in steering
their Course; and besides, being some∣times
carried to the South, and sometimes
to the North by the Violence of the
Streams, they did not make the Advance
they would have done if they had been
us'd to navigate the River. Besides, <HI>Tex∣eira</HI>
being obliged to provide for the Sub∣sistence
of all those People he carried with
him, and perceiving his Provisions dimi∣nished
considerably every day, was forc'd
from time to time to send Parties in some
of the Canoos to make Descents some∣times
on Islands, and sometimes on the
Continent, to procure a Supply.</P>

both from the People he carried with him,
and from the length of the way; and the
happy Descent of his advanc'd Squadron in∣to
the Country of the Quixos, belonging to
the Government of Quito.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Travellers were not advanc'd
half way their Voyage, before the
<PB N="38" REF="26"/>
Indians were weary of their Labour, and
quitting their Oars, began to murmur, and
make loud Complaints that they had been
engag'd in so tedious a Voyage. 'Twas in
vain to tell 'em they would soon be at the
end of it: they desir'd <HI>Texeira</HI> to dismiss
'em, and finding he put 'em off from day
to day, many tack'd about and return'd to
<HI>Para.</HI> The General perceiv'd, that on this
occasion he must use Prudence rather than
Force, therefore he did not cause them
that were fled back to be pursu'd, but en∣deavour'd
with all imaginable Mildness to
hinder others from following their Exam∣ple:
To this end he treated the Indians
that remain'd with very kind Words, and
so extremely pleas'd 'em with his Dis∣course,
that those that heard him convey'd
it from one Canoo to another with those
external Demonstrations of Joy and Satis∣faction,
which they use to express in their
Assemblies, so that they unanimously cry'd
from all the Canoos, that they were wil∣ling
<HI>Texeira</HI> should continue his Voyage,
and that they would never leave him. The
General having given 'em his Thanks for
their goodwill, caus'd some Brandy to be
distributed through all the Canoos, assuring
'em they would in a little time arrive at
the Place design'd. And not content in
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>
having spread this Report among 'em, to
fix the Indians the more firmly in their
Resolution, he thought it necessary to do
somewhat that might still make a greater
appearance for their Encouragement. To
this purpose he visited all the Canoos, and
chose out eight of the best of 'em, which
he loaded with Provision, Souldiers and
Rowers. He made Colonel <HI>Benedito Ro∣driguez
d'Olivera,</HI> a Native of <HI>Brazil,</HI> Com∣mander
of this Squadron; and having
communicated his Design to him, sent him
away with a Charge to send him often such
News as might be most agreeable to the
Indians. <HI>Olivera</HI> was no ordinary Man,
he had naturally a quick and piercing Wit;
and having been all his Life brought up
with the Indians, he had so well studied
their Actions and Countenances, that they
could hardly dissemble so well, but he could
with one cast of his Eye discover what was
in their Minds; so that they look'd upon
him as a Man that could divine what o∣thers
thought; and from this Conceit they
had not only a great Veneration for him,
but stood so much in awe of him, that
they yielded him a blind Obedience in what
he commanded 'em. It is not to be questi∣on'd
after this, whether those in the eight
Canoos which he was to command were
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>
very willing to go with him. His Men
were so industrious one while at their Oars,
and another while at their Sails, that they
overcame all the Obstacles that presented,
and safely arriv'd on the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1638,
at the place where the River of <HI>Pagamino</HI>
enters into the <HI>Amazone.</HI> There is a Port
near that place call'd after the Name of the
River, where the Spaniards had fortified
themselves, and had built a Town to keep

longer have met with the Entrance of the
River <HI>Napo,</HI> of which some account shall
be given hereafter; where they would
have met with better Entertainment, and
would have been less expos'd to the Losses
and Inconveniences which they suffer'd in

Colonel <HI>Benedito</HI> dispatch'd a Canoo to his

General, to give him advice of the Success
of his Voyage, and in how little time he
might also arrive at the same place. This
News being spread through the Fleet, in∣spir'd
them with new Vigor, when their
Courage was almost exhausted with the
tedious length of their Toil and Hunger
together. <HI>Texeira</HI> made an Improvement
of this good Success like a prudent Man,
and confirm'd the Assurance that had been
given 'em of their near approach to the
place where they were to land, and fol∣low'd
<HI>Benedito</HI> with great Expedition:
The <HI>Portuguez</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> perform'd
their Duty with great Emulation, and eve∣ry
day that came about they concluded the
next would be the last of their Voyage. In
fine, the Day so much long'd for appear'd;
and the General, to acquit himself of his
Promise, landed all his Men at the mouth
of a River that descends into that of the
<HI>Amazones</HI> through the Province of those
Indians that wear their Hair as long as
that of Women. These People formerly
kept a good Correspondence with the
Spaniards, and consented to their Establish∣ment
in their Country: but having been
forced to take up Arms against Captain
<HI>Palacios</HI> for the ill Treatment they had re∣ceiv'd
from his Souldiers; and having kill'd
<PB N="42" REF="28"/>
the Captain himself in a Battel, they re∣main'd
implacable Enemies to the Spa∣niards.
The Portuguez General who had
never been inform'd of this Rupture, was
desirous to refresh his Troops in this Coun∣try,
finding it to be a very fine, fruit∣ful
and commodious place; he therefore
pitch'd his Camp in the Angle of Land
which was form'd by the two Rivers, and
having well intrench'd it towards the
Plain, he there plac'd his Portuguez and
Indians, and made Captain <HI>Peter Dacosta
Favotta,</HI> and Captain <HI>Peter Bajou</HI> the chief
Commanders over 'em. These two wise
and valiant Officers gave their General the
greatest Proofs imaginable both of their
Conduct and Fidelity. They continued
encamp'd in this place for eleven Months,
in which time they endur'd extraordinary
Inconveniences, for they were often oblig'd
to fight with these long-hair'd Men to ob∣tain
a little Food to live upon; and many
of the Souldiers fell sick, partly by the
bad Disposition of the Air, which could
not be wholsome between two Rivers,
and partly from so tedious a Confinement

<HI>Quito,</HI> they took the way of those high
Mountains on foot, from which that great
River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> derives its Sources,
a River which has nothing in its rise where∣in
it excels other Rivers, but is so very
much augmented in its Course, that the
Mouth of it is eighty four Leagues in
breadth. These Jesuits took all the care
they could, and labour'd with all possible
Accuracy to observe every thing that was
worth a Remark; they took the Latitudes
in every place of the River where they
could do it; they took an account of the
Names of all the Rivers that run into it,
and of all the Nations that inhabit the
Borders of it: They took notice of the
<PB N="49" REF="31"/>
Quality of the Lands, of the Goodness of
the Fruits, of the Temperature of the
Climates, and of every thing that is ser∣viceable
to the Life of Man; they enter'd
into Commerce with the People of the
Country: In a word, they forgot nothing
that they thought might conduce to fur∣nish
them with a perfect Knowledg of
those Provinces, which had never been
entirely discover'd till then. Therefore
they that read this Relation, are desir'd by
one of those Fathers, who undertook to
expose it to the World, not to disbelieve
what he has written, because he can prove
that what he affirms for a Truth, is really
so, by above thirty Spaniards and Portu∣guez
that accompanied him in this Voy∣age;

imagine he makes no Conscience of affirm∣ing
things that are untrue in a matter of
this Weight and Importance.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The general Idea which Father D'Acugna
gives of this River, and the Elogiums he

<P>ON the famous River of <HI>Amazons</HI> is
the richest, most fertile, and best
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>
peopled Country of <HI>Peru;</HI> and without
an <HI>Hyperbole</HI> 'tis the largest and most emi∣nent
River in the World; it passes through
divers Kingdoms of a vast Extent, and
enriches more Provinces than the <HI>Ganges,</HI>
that vast River that waters part of the
<HI>East Indies;</HI> than the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> which af∣ter
it has run through <HI>Persia,</HI> comes across
<HI>Syria</HI> to throw it self into the Sea; or
than the <HI>Nile,</HI> which comes out of the
Mountains of <HI>Cuama,</HI> and passing through
<HI>Africa,</HI> and the most barren Countries
in the World, turns them into fruit∣ful
and delicious Provinces by the over∣flowing
of its Waters. In a word, the
River <HI>Amazone</HI> nourishes an infinitely
greater number of People, and carries its
fresh Water a great way further into the
Sea, than any of those mighty Rivers, al∣tho
these have given their Names to entire
Gulphs, or troubled the Sea with their
Waters to a considerable length. A great
many more Rivers fall into the <HI>Amazone</HI>
than into the <HI>Ganges;</HI> and if the Banks of
the latter are cover'd with gilded Sand,
those of the former are fill'd with a Sand
of pure Gold, and the Waters that always
wash them are continually discovering
Mines of Gold and Silver in the Bowels
of the Earth. In short, the Places it
<PB N="51" REF="32"/>
waters are an Earthly Paradise; and if
Men did but lend their Assistance▪ Na∣ture
in that Country as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,
all the Borders of that great River would
be full of large Gardens perpetually fill'd
with Fruits and Flowers: It sometimes
overflows its Banks, and thereby renders
all the Ground fruitful through which its
Waters pass, and that not only for one, but
for several Years. After all these extraor∣dinary
Improvements, the change of Sea∣sons
is not necessary to the Provinces si∣tuate
near this great River. They find
every thing near 'em, abundance of Fish in
their Waters more than they can wish; a
thousand different kinds of Animals in the
neighbouring Mountains, all sorts of Birds
in such plenty as can hardly be imagined:
The Trees always loaded with Fruit, the
Fields with a plentiful Crop, and the
Bowels of the Earth consisting of preci∣ous
Mines of all sorts of Metals. In
fine, among the vast number of People
that dwell along the Banks of this River,
there are scarce any to be seen but what
are handsome, well made, and very in∣genious
in all things they are concern'd
about.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Source of this River, and the Emula∣tion
of all the Provinces of Peru about it.</HEAD>
<P>TO enter into a particular History of
this River, I shall begin with its
Original: and as there have heretofore been
great Contests between eminent Cities a∣bout
the Birth of divers Hero's of former
Ages; so there is no less Emulation among
the Provinces of <HI>Peru,</HI> which of them
should be the Mother of this great River,
because the true Source of it is unknown
to this day. The City of <HI>Lima,</HI> as mag∣nificent
and as potent as it is, boasts that
she has the Mountains of <HI>Ganneo</HI> and the
<HI>Cavaliers</HI> within her Jurisdiction, and the
Fountain-head of the <HI>Amazone</HI> seventy
Leagues above her: But this is not the
Source of it, but of another River that
runs into the <HI>Amazone.</HI> Others maintain
that the Source of this great River pro∣ceeds
from the Mountains of <HI>Moida</HI> in
the new Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> and is
call'd the River <HI>Caquetta:</HI> but they are
mistaken too, and confound the matter;
for the <HI>Caquetta</HI> and the <HI>Amazone</HI> run se∣parately
above seven hundred Leagues,
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>
and when they come near together, the
<HI>Caquetta</HI> seems to turn its Course, and
running on the side of the <HI>Amazone</HI> at a
considerable distance, thus continues it,
till having at length pierced through
the Province of <HI>Agnos,</HI> it comes to add
its Waters to that vast River. But in
a word, <HI>Peru</HI> in general claims the Ori∣ginal
of this great Work of Nature.</P>
<P>But the truth of this matter is, that the
City of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Quito,</HI>
has the sole Glory of producing this great
Wonder of the World. Eight Leagues
from this City is found the true Source of
this River beyond those vast Mountains
that divide the Jurisdiction of this City
from that of the <HI>Quixos,</HI> at the foot of two
great Rocks, one of which is call'd <HI>Gua∣mana,</HI>
and the other <HI>Pulca,</HI> which stand
at near two Leagues distance one from
another. Between those two Mountains
is a great Lake, and in the midst of this
Lake is another Mountain, which has been
torn up by the very Roots by an Earth∣quake,
and so overturn'd in the Lake,
which is very deep and large: 'Tis from
this Lake that the great River of <HI>Ama∣zons</HI>
proceeds, within twenty Minutes of
the Equinoctial Line, Southern Latitude.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="54" REF="34"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Course of this River, its Length, its
different Breadth and Depth.</HEAD>
<P>THis River runs from West to East,
it continually coasts along the South
side of the Equinoctial Line, and is not
distant from it above two, three, four or
at most five Degrees in the greatest of its
Windings: From its Rise to the Place
where it empties it self into the Sea, it
runs not above 1276 good Spanish Leagues,
tho <HI>Oreillane</HI> makes it 1800. It always
proceeds in a winding Course, and by its
great Turnings, which are like so many
Arms, draws into its Channel a great
number of Rivers as well from the South
as the North side of it. Its breadth is
different; in some places 'tis a League
wide, in others two, three, and more; in
other Places it does not widen it self any
more for a long space, as if it were to a∣mass
all its Waters, and its whole impe∣tuous
Force together, to discharge it self
by a Mouth of eighty four Leagues broad
into the Sea.</P>
<P>The narrowest Place of this River is a
quarter of a League, or a little less, in
<PB N="55" REF="34"/>
two Degrees two thirds of Southern La∣titude.</P>
<P>This Strait by the Providence of God,
is fitly situated for the building of a Cita∣del
to stop the Course of the strongest E∣nemy
that should enter by Sea through
the Mouth of this River; and if an Ene∣my
should come down by a River that
runs into the <HI>Amazon</HI> call'd <HI>Rionegro,</HI> by
building a Fort just where this River en∣ters
into the <HI>Amazone,</HI> this Passage may be
so secured, that any that should attempt
to get through it may be easily hindred.
This Strait is three hundred and seven∣ty
Leagues from the Mouth of the River,
from whence with Canoos and other light
Vessels with Sails and Oars, timely Ad∣vice
might be given in eight days of the
Arrival of any Vessels, that the Fort at
this Strait might put it self in a posture of
Defence, and stop the Enemy's Passage.
The Depth of this River is in some Pla∣ces
so great, that no Bottom is to be found:
from the Mouth of it, to the River <HI>Rio∣negro,</HI>
which is near 600 Leagues, there's
always at least thirty or forty Fathom of
Water in its greatest Channel. From
thence upwards the Depth of it is un∣certain,
sometimes twenty, sometimes
twelve, and sometimes eight Fathom:
<PB N="56" REF="35"/>
But at its Beginning it has Water enough
to carry the largest Vessels: For tho the
Current be very swift; yet every day
without fail there rise certain Eastern
Breezes, that continue three or four Hours
together, and sometimes a whole day;
which hold back the Waters, so as to re∣tain
the Stream in a degree of Motion that
is not violent.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The great number of Islands in this River,
and the means the Inhabitants use for the
Preservation of their Roots at the time of
its Inundations.</HEAD>
<P>THis River is all full of Islands of all
Sizes, and in so great number, that
they are not to be counted, many of them
being very near one to another. There are
some four or five, others ten, and others
20 Leagues in compass. That which is in∣habited
by the <HI>Toupinambi,</HI> of whom we
shall speak hereafter, is above 100 Leagues
about: There are a great many very small
Islands, which the Inhabitants of the
Country use only to sow their Seed in;
but all of these, and the greatest part of
the large ones, are overflowed by the River
<PB N="57" REF="35"/>
every Year; and these regular Inunda∣tions
do so enrich them with the Slime and
Mud it carries along with it, that they
would never become barren, tho they
should be every year sown with <HI>Yu∣ca</HI>
or <HI>Magnioca,</HI> which are a sort of
Roots, which serve the Natives instead
of Bread, and with which the Earth fur∣nishes
them in great abundance.</P>
<P>Tho these frequent Inundations seem to
be attended with great Inconveniences;
yet the Author of Nature has taught these
Barbarians to make a good Improvement
of them. Before these Floods come, they
gather in all their <HI>Yuca,</HI> of which Root
they make a sort of Bread called <HI>Cassave,</HI>
which is ordinarily used in all the Coasts
of <HI>Brazil,</HI> and in many other Places both
of the Continent and Islands of <HI>America.</HI>
They make great Caves in the Ground,
wherein they put these Roots; and having
well stopp'd them up with Earth, leave
'em there as long as the Flood lasts: this is
an infallible way of preserving those Roots
which otherwise would be subject to rot
with the excessive moisture of the Ground.
When the Waters are run off, they open
these Caves, and take out their Roots,
and eat them, without finding them at all
the worse for lying in the Earth. Thus as
<PB N="58" REF="36"/>
Nature has taught the Ant to store up
Food enough to nourish her all the Year,
no wonder she has taught the Indians,
as barbarous as they are, how to preserve
their Provisions, seeing the Divine Provi∣dence
takes a more particular Care of Men
than of Beasts.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Bread and Drink made by the Inhabi∣tants
to these Islands, and other Places that
border on this River; and the various
sorts of Fruits, Roots and Grain they
live upon.</HEAD>
<P>THe Roots of Yuca we have been
speaking of, serve these People for
Bread, which they eat with their other
Food; besides this they make a Drink of it,
which they all generally esteem as the most
delicious and excellent Liquor in the World.
To make the Bread, they squeeze out all
the Juice of the Root, and then beat and
pound it, till 'tis become a kind of Meal,
of which they make great Cakes, and
bake them in an Oven; this they call <HI>Cas∣save,</HI>
which has a very pleasant Taste
when 'tis new, but after one day becomes
very dry, so that it may be kept several
Months; they ordinarily put it on the tops
<PB N="59" REF="36"/>
of their Huts, that it may keep the more
dry. And when they have a mind to make
their Drink, they take these dry Cakes, and
temper them in Water, which they boil
as long as they think sufficient, over a
gentle Fire: This Paste boil'd thus in
Water, makes a Drink so strong by its great
Fermentation, that it fuddles 'em like our
Wine. They use this Drink at all their
Assemblies and Entertainments, as when
they inter their Dead, when they receive
any Guests, when they celebrate their
Feasts, at their Seed-time, and Harvest;
in a word, at all times when they meet,
this Liquor is the Spirit that animates 'em,
and the Charm that holds 'em together.
They make besides this, another sort of
Drink, with a great deal of wild Fruit,
of which they have extraordinary plenty;
this they peel, and put in Water, with
which when it is well mix'd, it soon by
Fermentation acquires such a Savour and
Strength, that it often has a more agree∣able
Relish than Beer, which is so much
in use in many Nations. They keep these
Liquors in great Earthen Vessels, as they
do in <HI>Spain,</HI> or in lesser ones, which they
make of the Trunk of a hollow Tree;
or else in Baskets made of Rushes, which
they cover within and without with a sort
<PB N="60" REF="37"/>
of Pitch, so that they don't leak in the
least. This Bread and Drink are not the
only Provisions they live upon; they have
many other sorts of Food in use amongst
'em, besides Fruit of various kinds, as
Bonanes, Ananas, Gouyaves, Amos, and
a sort of very pleasant Chesnuts, which
at <HI>Peru</HI> they call <HI>Almandras de la Sierra,</HI> that
is Mountain-Almonds; but the Truth is,
they are rather of the Figure of a Chesnut
than of an Almond, because they grow
in Hulls that are bristly, like those of
our Chesnuts: They have Palms of va∣rious
kinds, Coco-Nuts, and Dates that
are very well tasted, tho they are wild,
and many other sorts of Fruit, that are
produced only in hot Countries. They
have likewise divers kinds of Roots, that
are good Food, as Batates, Yuca, Mensa,
which the Portuguez call <HI>Machachora,</HI>
and <HI>Cajas,</HI> which are like our Saligots, and
others, which are good both to rost and
boil, have a pleasant Relish, and are ve∣ry
nourishing.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The great Plenty of Fish in this River, and
which is the best sort of them.</HEAD>
<P>FIsh is so common with 'em, that when
any one offers it to 'em, they prover∣bially
say, E'ne put it in your own Dish.
There is so great a number of 'em in the
River, that without any other Nets than
their Hands, they can take as many as they
please. But the <HI>Pege Buey</HI> is as it were
the King of all the Fish that swim in
the River <HI>Amazone,</HI> from its Source till it
discharges it self into the Sea. 'Tis not
to be imagin'd what a delicious Taste this
Fish has, any one that eats it would think
it to be most excellent Flesh well season'd:
This Fish is as big as a Heifer of a Year
and a half old, it has a Head and Ears just
like those of a Heifer, and the Body of it
is all cover'd with Hair, like the Bristles
of a white Hog; it swims with two little
Arms, and under its Belly it has Teats
with which it suckles its young Ones: The
Skin of it is very thick, and when 'tis
dress'd into Leather it serves to make Tar∣gets
that are Proof against a Musquet Bul∣let.
This Fish feeds upon Grass on the
Bank of the River, like an Ox, from which
it receives so good Nourishment, and is
<PB N="62" REF="38"/>
of so pleasant a Taste, that a Man is more
strengthen'd and better satisfied in eating a
small quantity of it, than in eating twice as
much Mutton: This Fish has not free Re∣spiration
in the Water, and therefore often
thrusts out its Snout to take Breath, and is
by this means discover'd to them that seek
after it. When the Indians get the sight of
it, they follow it with their Oars in little
Canoos; and when it appears above Water
to get Breath, they throw at it their sort of
Harping-Irons made of Shells, with which
they stop its course, and take it: when they
have kill'd it, they cut it into good pieces,
and broil it upon Wooden Grates, which
they call <HI>Boucan;</HI> and being thus dress'd,
'twill keep good above a Month: They
have not the way of salting and drying it
to keep a great while, because they have
no great quantity of Salt, and that which
they use to season their Meat is very rare
with 'em, and is made only of the Ashes
of a sort of Palm-Tree, so that 'tis more
like Salt-Peter than common Salt.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Note.</HI> This <HI>Pege Buey</HI> is very common in all the Rivers along the Coast of the Continent, and is call'd by the English <HI>Manati.</HI> There is a great Vend for 'em in the <HI>Antilles</HI> or <HI>Antego</HI>-Islands, whither the Captains of Merchant-Ships carry 'em, who buy 'em of the Indians that fish for 'em in the Rivers, for Knives and Bills, and make the Sea-men bone 'em and salt 'em, that they may keep till they have opportunity to sell 'em.</NOTE>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Means the Indians use to preserve their
Fish in those Seasons wherein they can nei∣ther
fish nor hunt.</HEAD>
<P>THO the Indians don't know how
to keep their broil'd Fish very long,
yet they sustain no great damage by it,
because Nature has given them Industry
enough to get fresh Meat all their Winter,
which is the time of the Rains, during
which they can neither hunt nor fish. For
this purpose they make choice of some fit
places where the Floods can never come,
and there they dig a kind of a Pond of a
moderate depth, to hold a good quantity
of Water, which they inclose round with
a Palisado of Stakes; they bring Water
into these Ponds, and keep 'em always
full, that they may use 'em as Reservers
for their Winter Provisions. At the sea∣son
when the Tortoises come ashore to
lay their Eggs, the Indians go to lie in
Ambush in the places where they know
they ordinarily come; and when they see
a sufficient number upon the shore, they
go and turn 'em upon their Backs, to hin∣der
'em from retreating; and when they
have thus secur'd 'em, they begin at their
<PB N="64" REF="39"/>
leisure to carry 'em to their Reservers:
for this end, when they are at any consi∣derable
distance from their Huts, they
string all their Tortoises together with
great Cords through holes that they make
on the top of their Shells, and turning 'em
upon their Feet lead 'em to the Water,
where they tie 'em to their Canoos, and so
make 'em follow them home: when they
are got home, they put 'em in their Re∣servers,
and unloose 'em, feeding 'em with
the Leaves and Branches of Trees which
they throw into them, and take 'em out
to spend as they want 'em. One of these
Tortoises is enough to feed a numerous
Family some time; so that 'tis not to be
wonder'd at, that these Indians are never
reduc'd to Scarcity, seeing they make Pro∣vision
of so great a number of Tortoises,
having commonly above a hundred in each
Reserver; so that the proportion they pro∣vide
for each Person in their Families is
enough to maintain several People. These
Tortoises are as large as those Targets
Souldiers formerly us'd to defend them∣selves
withal, and their Flesh is as good as
that of a Heifer. At the time of their
laying, some Females are found with two
or three hundred Eggs in their Belly big∣ger
than those of Pullets, and as good, tho
<PB N="65" REF="39"/>
not of so easy Digestion. At one Season
of the Year they are so fat, that a good
Barrel of Fat may be taken out of 'em,
which is as good as Butter, and being
salted a little, tastes extraordinary well, and
keeps very well too; this will not only
serve to fry Fish, but is likewise as good
for Sauces as the best Butter in the World:
so that these Barbarians have no absolute
need of our Commodities, but make as
good Provision for their Necessities, as the
most civiliz'd Nations in the World can do.
'Tis not amiss further to remark two things
in respect of these Tortoises; one is, that
after they have made a Hole in the Sand
above the Bounds of the highest Tides,
they lay all their Eggs at a time, one after
another, after which they carefully cover
them up with the same Sand they have
digged up to make their Nest, so that 'tis
impossible for any to discover the place of
it. Then they return backwards into the
Water, to prevent the notice of their true
Track, and never come ashore again till
the next Year, leaving their Eggs to be
hatch'd by the Heat of the Sun, which is
always accomplish'd in forty days; after
which the young ones are seen to creep
out of the Sand, being about the bigness
of a Crown, and thus in a train, like Ants,
they make to the Water. The other Re∣mark
<PB N="66" REF="40"/>
is, that the Sea-men bone 'em, and
salt them, and so carry 'em into all the
Colonies of the <HI>Antego</HI> Islands, a Trade
in which many Captains and Merchants
have found their Account.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Prudence these People have been taught
by Necessity, and the Confidence they have
in the abundance of all things which they
enjoy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Indians of this happy River
make this prudent Provision I have
been speaking of, for a Season wherein
they seem to want every thing; but their
Winter being past, their Fears are carried
away with it, and they have plenty of all
things; so that they never take care for the
Morrow: and because they don't think
of wanting any thing the ensuing day,
they make no other Provision for it, than in
feeding themselves well to day, that they
may be the stronger and more ready in
seeking their Food to morrow. They have
all imaginable Dexterity in catching all
sorts of Fish that are in this River, and
have as many ways for it as there is diver∣sity
of Seasons. When the Inundations
diminish, and leave Lakes in the lower
<PB N="67" REF="40"/>
parts of the Lands that have been over∣flow'd,
they have a very pleasant Trick
to take the Fish that are left in those
places: They strike the Water with two
or three flat Sticks, with the noise of
which the Fish are no sooner stunn'd, but
they come up to the top of the Water, as
if they were dead, and suffer themselves to
be taken up with the hand: Not that it is
the Noise that produces this Effect, but
the Quality of the Wood, which makes
the Fish drunk. The <HI>Galibis</HI> who are the
Natives of <HI>Cayen,</HI> and of one part of <HI>Guia∣na,</HI>
make use of it, and call it <HI>Inecou.</HI></P>
<P>But the most common way of fishing
which they use at all times, and on all
occasions, is with an Arrow which they
dart with one hand from a smooth little
Board which they hold in t'other. This
Arrow having pierc'd the Fish, serves in∣stead
of a Cork to shew which way it
moves when it is wounded; they pursue
it in their Canoos, and getting hold of
the end of the Arrow they draw up the
Fish with it: they catch all sorts of Fish
after this manner, neither small nor great
can escape their Weapons. And there are
so many sorts of 'em in this River, and all
of 'em so excellent, that it would be too
tedious a business to give an ample De∣scription
of 'em. There is one amongst
<PB N="68" REF="41"/>
the rest which the Indians call <HI>Paraque,</HI>
which resembles a great Eel, or rather a
small Conger, which has a very strange
Property; for if a Man takes it in his
Hand while 'tis alive, immediately a Cold∣ness
and Shivering seizes him, as if he
were taken with a fit of an Ague; but the
shaking presently ceases upon letting it go
out of his Hand again.</P>

<P>TO prevent the Disgust these wild
People might have of Fish, tho it
were never so good, if they should always
be forc'd to feed upon it, and to satisfy the
Desire they might have of sometimes eat∣ing
Flesh, Nature has render'd the Land
as favourable to 'em as the Water; for
it produces Animals of all kinds, as well
for the Necessity as for the Delight of its
Inhabitants. But among others there is a
Creature call'd <HI>Dautas,</HI> of the bigness of a
Mule, and very like one both in Colour
and Shape, the Flesh of which is as good
as that of a young Bullock, only it has a
<PB N="69" REF="41"/>
more faint and waterish Taste: They have
likewise a sort of Hogs in the Mountains,
that are neither of our domestick, nor of
our wild kind of Swine, but of a particular
Species, which have a sort of Vent upon
their Backs, like a Navel. All the <HI>West
Indies</HI> are stor'd with this kind of Animals:
Their Flesh is very good and wholsome,
and at least may compare with that of the
wild Swine that are taken in some Forests
in <HI>Europe.</HI> Besides these, there is another
sort resembling our Domestick Hogs: they
have also <HI>Renados, Pacas, Cotias, Ignanats,
Agotis,</HI> and other Animals which are pe∣culiar
to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and are as good
as the most delicious sorts we have in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
They have also Partridges, and tame
Poultry like ours, which have been
brought to 'em from <HI>Peru,</HI> and which
from one to another have been spread
throughout the Coasts of the River of
<HI>Amazons.</HI> The many Lakes they have
up and down breed a multitude of Geese,
and other Water-Fowl. 'Tis very re∣markable
how little Pains their Game costs
'em: We often had experience of it in
our Camp. Every Evening when our
Men went ashore, after they had caus'd the
Indians that were of our Party to make
us as many Huts as were necessary to lodg
us (which took up some time); our
<PB N="70" REF="42"/>
Company separated, some went a hunting
in the Mountains with their Dogs, others
went upon the River with their Bows
and Arrows, and in a few hours time we
should see 'em return loaded with more
Fish and Venison than all our Men could

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The agreeable Temperature of the Air in all
this Country; what it is that makes Win∣ter
there, and whether the Heat be great,
it being under the Line. That there is
but one Inconveniency there.</HEAD>
<P>ALL along this River, and in all the
neighbouring Provinces, the Air is
so temperate, and the Seasons of the
Year so regular, that there's no Excess ei∣ther
of Heat or Cold, nor any troublesome
variety of Weather: For tho there is eve∣ry
Year a kind of Winter, yet it does not
proceed from the different Course of the
Planets, or Distance of the Sun, for that
<PB N="71" REF="42"/>
always rises and sets at the same hour.
That which most incommodes 'em is the
frequency of the Inundations, which leave
a great Dampness in the Ground, and by
their overflowing the Plains, hinder 'em
several Months from sowing and gather∣ing
in the Fruits of the Earth. By these
Floods they distinguish the Winter from
the Spring throughout all <HI>Peru:</HI> they call
all that time wherein the Earth produces
no Crop, the Winter; and they call that
Season the Spring, which they employ in
sowing, and gathering in not only their
<HI>Maze,</HI> which is the principal part of their
Harvest, but all the other Product of the
Ground, whether that which grows spon∣taneously,
or by Cultivation. These In∣undations
happen twice a Year all along
the whole Extent of this River.</P>
<P>We have observ'd, that those who dwell
near the Mountains of <HI>Quito,</HI> suffer more
Heat than those that inhabit along this Ri∣ver
towards the Sea; the reason is, be∣cause
there come Breezes from the Coast
of the Northern Sea, that continue two,
three or four hours in a day, and sometimes
more; these Winds extreamly refresh the
Air, and are a great Comfort to those Peo∣ple
that are less remote from the Sea.</P>
<P>However, it must be said that the high∣est
degree of Heat, even in the Moun∣tains
<PB N="72" REF="43"/>
themselves, is no greater than is at
<HI>Panama,</HI> and at <HI>Cartagena:</HI> for however
violent it be in it self, it is every where mo∣derated
by the gentle Winds, which blow
every day, and not only render the Air to∣lerable
and agreeable to the Inhabitants,
but have besides the Property of preserv∣ing
all their Victuals and Stores from cor∣rupting.
I have had the Experience of it
my self in the Wafers we carried with us,
which at the end of five Months and a
half since we parted from <HI>Quito,</HI> were as
good as if they had been newly made.
This made me and my Companion won∣der
the more, because in our Travels in
almost all other Parts of <HI>America,</HI> we ob∣serv'd,
that Bread and other things of the
least Substance corrupted in a little time.</P>
<P>And tho all this long stretch of Land is
so near the Equinoctial Line, yet the Heat
of the Sun is not at all hurtful, nor the
Evening Air neither, tho it be very cool
and moist. I have good reason to testify
this, for during our whole Voyage I have
commonly pass'd whole Nights in the o∣pen
Air, without getting the least Pain in
my Head, or the least Defluxion of Rhume;
and yet in all other Places, the least walk∣ing
abroad in a Moon-shiny Night, has
very much incommoded me. 'Tis true,
at the beginning of our Voyage, almost all
<PB N="73" REF="43"/>
of our Men that came from cold Coun∣tries
had Agues, but were all cur'd by
bleeding three or four times. We neither
felt, nor heard of any such bad Air along
this River, as there is in almost all other
places of <HI>Peru</HI> that have been discover'd,
where People are sometimes in a moment
taken with violent Rhumatisms through∣out
all their Limbs, which could not pro∣ceed
but from a sudden Corruption of the
Humours, and which in some degenerated
to an incurable Palsy, and cost others their
Lives. In a word, were it not for the Heats
which are in most of the inhabited Parts
of <HI>Peru</HI> intolerable, the Country of the
River of <HI>Amazons</HI> might without Exagge∣ration
be term'd an Earthly Paradise.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Beauty of this Country, and the abun∣dance
of Medicinal Simples, Plants and
Trees it yields.</HEAD>
<P>THis sweet Temperature of the Air
causes all the Borders of this River
to be cover'd with a thousand kinds of love∣ly
Trees, the pleasant Verdure of which is
perpetually preserv'd by the moderate Dis∣position
of the Air: a thousand Landskips
were presented to our Eyes still more and
<PB N="74" REF="44"/>
more fine, and more diversified, as if they
emulated one another, and made us confess
that Art had yet a great deal to learn
of Nature, when she discovers her self af∣ter
so excellent and surprizing a manner.
The Ground is very low in most places near
the Banks of the River, but rises gradually
at a distance, with little Hills that adjoin to
curious Plains all cover'd with Flowers,
without so much as a Tree; beyond these
are lovely Vales all cloth'd with Grass
and Herbs, preserv'd continually green by
the refreshing Rivulets that run through
'em.</P>
<P>Beyond all this Extent of Ground are
Hills rising one above another, till they
make those high Mountains which extend
from one end of <HI>Peru</HI> to the other, call'd
<HI>Cordeliers,</HI> because they are rang'd in order,
as if they were plac'd by a Line or Cord.</P>
<P>There are a great many Thickets that
produce all sorts of Simples, which the
Indians know how to use for the Cure of
their Diseases. There grow <HI>Cassia</HI>-Trees,
which bear the best <HI>Cassia</HI> in all the <HI>Indies.</HI>
There is excellent <HI>Sarsaparilla, Gums</HI> and
<HI>Rosins,</HI> that are very good for Wounds
and Bruises; and a prodigious quantity of
Honey, which the Bees on all sides make
in such abundance, that the store of it is
not to be exhausted. This is as good to
<PB N="75" REF="44"/>
eat, as it is for the Composition of various
Medicines: The Bees also make a sort of
black Wax, which is however very good,
and burns as well as that which is white or
yellow. There are a kind of Trees, call'd
by the People of the Country <HI>Audirouas,</HI>
from which there runs an Oil of extraor∣dinary
Virtue for curing Wounds: There
is another Tree call'd <HI>Copayba,</HI> which yields
a Balm surpassing the best that is to be
had in the East. In a word, there grows
a multitude of different kinds of Herbs
and Plants of very great Virtue, besides
those that are not yet known, which would
suffice to make a new <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> and a
second <HI>Pliny:</HI> And it would be a matter
of no small Difficulty to give an account
of all the Properties of so many different
Simples.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Multitude of Trees that grow in this
Countrey, Cedars, and other kinds fit for

<P>THE Trees that grow along this Ri∣ver
are innumerable, and of a sur∣prizing
<PB N="76" REF="45"/>
Tallness and Bulk. I measured a
Cedar that was thirty Hands breadth in
Compass; the Poplars are almost all of
that size, and excellent Timber for build∣ing
either for Sea or Land. Those Trees
which are known in the Country, are for
the most part Cedars, <HI>Coibos, Palohierro,</HI>
and <HI>Palocolorado,</HI> and other such like,
which are no sooner cut down, but they
may be safely used; and the Vessels that
are made of 'em may be launched as soon
as they are finished. There is no need of
any of the Materials of <HI>Europe</HI> for the
building of 'em in those Parts; but only
of <HI>Iron</HI> for the forging of Nails, and o∣ther
pieces of Smiths Work necessary to
the building of great and small Vessels.
All other things are found in this Country
in great Plenty: The Inhabitants make
Cables of the Bark of Trees; they have
Pitch and Tar as good as are to be had in
<HI>Europe;</HI> and they have Oil either to ren∣der
it firm and solid, or to temper its
Hardness; one sort of which they draw
from Fish, and another sort they get from
Trees. They make a sort of Tow, which
they call <HI>Ambira,</HI> so good, that no better
can be used for the caulking of Vessels,
and to make Musket-Match. Their Cot∣ton
abundantly furnishes 'em with Stuff to
make Sails, and this grows the best of all
<PB N="77" REF="45"/>
the small Seeds they sow in their Fields.
And after all, there are so great numbers
of People, that one might have as many
Work-men and Sea-men as one pleas'd for

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Four things which abound on the Banks of
this River, which are capable of inriching
great Kingdoms.</HEAD>
<P>THere are four things along this Ri∣ver,
which being well manag'd,
would be capable of enriching many King∣doms;
the first is <HI>Wood</HI> for building, of
which there is some found of a rare and
particular Colour, like fine Ebony; and
there is so prodigious a quantity of com∣mon
Wood, that is worth transporting,
that how much soever should be carried a∣way,
the Country can never be exhausted.</P>
<P>The second thing is the <HI>Coco-tree,</HI>
which serves for the Composition of Cho∣colat;
with these the Banks of the River
are covered, and throughout our whole
Voyage, our Men cut scarce any thing
else to make Huts of for our Camp. This
Tree is very much esteem'd for its Fruit
<PB N="78" REF="46"/>
throughout all <HI>New Spain,</HI> and in all other
Places where it is known what Chocolat
is. Every Foot of this Tree will produce
eight Silver Rials, all Charges paid. And
it may easily be suppos'd there's no need of
great labour to cultivate these Trees along
this River, seeing Nature, without the
Assistance of Husbandry and Art, makes
'em bring forth Fruit in so great abundance.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>Tobacco,</HI> of which there
is a prodigious quantity along this River,
which is very much esteem'd by all the
Natives; so that if it were raised with
that Care this Plant requires, it would be
the best Tobacco in the World; because in
the Judgment of those that understand it,
there can't be desired a better Soil and Cli∣mat
for this sort of Plant, than what is to
be found on this River.</P>
<P>But that which is the most considerable
of all, and for the sake of which in my
opinion it would be very well worth the
while to make firm and substantial Esta∣blishments
along this River, is <HI>Sugar:</HI> This
is the fourth thing; and the Traffick of
it is more honourable, as well as the Profit
more sure and greater for a Nation than
that of the rest. And now since we
are ingag'd in a War with the Dutch, it
ought to excite an Emulation in us, and
make us endeavour to furnish our selves
<PB N="79" REF="46"/>
with those Commodities our Enemies
bring from <HI>Brazil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note.</HI> At the time when this Voyage was made, the Dutch, who were at War with the Spaniards, had conquer'd and possess'd themselves of almost all <HI>Brazil,</HI> the Dutch West-India Company then having Prince <HI>Maurice de Nassau</HI> for the General of all their Troops both by Sea and Land.</NOTE>; and we ought to e∣stablish
our selves with all Expedition in
this Countrey, and set up Mills and o∣ther
Sugar-Works; which would neither
require very much Time, nor Labour, nor
Charge, which last is that which is most
fear'd now a days. The Ground is as good
for the planting of Sugar-Canes, as any
is in the whole Continent of <HI>Brazil;</HI> and
of this we can give Assurance, as having
seen and known all those Provinces. The
Soil on the Banks of this River is white
and fat, of as good a kind as can be desired
by those that know what belongs to the
Cultivation of these Plants; and it becomes
so fruitful and rich by the Inundations
of the River, which by continuing a few
days improve the Ground, that there is
more reason to fear too great than too little
a Crop. 'Twill be no new thing to make
Sugar-Canes grow in this Country, be∣cause
we found throughout the whole
Length of this great River, such as gave
us sufficient Proof of the great abun∣dance
to which they might be multiplied
<PB N="80" REF="47"/>
whenever any People should apply them∣selves
to cultivate 'em, and to make Su∣gar-Mills,
which might be done with a
little Charge at any time; not only be∣cause
there's all sorts of Wood in great
plenty, as I have already said, but also
because there is the Conveniency of Wa∣ter
for 'em in as great quantity as one can
desire. There is nothing wanting but
<HI>Copper,</HI> which we may supply in sending
it thither from our own Country, and
which we may be sure will turn to a con∣siderable

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Convincing Reasons to shew that many of

needs contain Mines of Gold and Silver.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not speak of the many Mines of
Gold and Silver, which are discover'd
in the conquer'd Countries, nor those
which Time may further discover there;
but I am mightily mistaken in my Judg∣ment,
if many others may not be found in
this Countrey more rich than all those of
<HI>Peru,</HI> tho the famous Mountain of <HI>Potosi</HI>
be comprehended in it: I speak not this
without ground, nor only with a design
to advance the Value of this great River,
but found what I say upon Reason and
Experience; because I have seen a great
deal of Gold among the Indians whom
we met as we went down the River, who
gave us very certain Assurances, that there
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>
were a great number of Gold and Silver
Mines in their Country. This great Ri∣ver
receives all the Waters of the richest
Countries of <HI>America.</HI> On the South-side,
those rich Rivers, some of which have
their Sources round about <HI>Potosi,</HI> others at
the Foot of <HI>Guanico,</HI> which is a Mountain
near the City of <HI>Lima,</HI> flow into it; o∣thers
come down from <HI>Cusco,</HI> others from
<HI>Cuenca,</HI> and from <HI>Gibaros,</HI> which is the
richest Country for Gold of any that has
been yet discovered; so that on this side
all the Rivers, Sources, little Springs and
Rivulets, which run into the Sea for the
space of 600 Leagues, that is from <HI>Potosi</HI>
as far as <HI>Quito,</HI> render Homage to the
River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> and pay it Tributes
of Gold; as all the others likewise do
that descend from the new Kingdom of
<HI>Granada,</HI> which is no less rich in Gold
than all the other Provinces of <HI>Peru.</HI>
And seeing this River is the great Channel
and principal Passage to all the richest Pla∣ces
of <HI>Peru,</HI> one may reasonably be assured,
that it is the Soveraign Mistress of them all:
besides, if that golden Lake hath all the
Gold which the common Report ascribes
to it; if the Amazons inhabit the richest
Mountains in the World, as many that
say they have seen 'em assure us; if the
<HI>Tocantins</HI> abound so much in precious
<PB N="83" REF="48"/>
Stones and Gold, as some of the French,
who have travell'd in their Country, do af∣firm;
if the <HI>Omagnas</HI> with the Reputation
of their vast Wealth, were once capable of
casting all <HI>Peru</HI> into confusion, and of
forcing the Viceroy to send a great Army
under the Conduct of <HI>Pedro de Orsua</HI> to
conquer their Country; all these Places
adjoin to the River of <HI>Amazons:</HI> The
Golden Lake, the <HI>Amazons,</HI> the <HI>Tocan∣tins,</HI>
and the <HI>Omagnas</HI> are upon the Banks
of it, as shall be shewn hereafter; and in
fine, this is the River that seems to be or∣dain'd

(tho <HI>Oreillane,</HI> who first discover'd

places above 400, without approach∣ing
any Country that is peopled by the
Spaniard on any side, there being only va∣rious
Nations of Indians that are yet un∣known,
to be found from this River to
those Places so far distant, it must be
granted that the breadth of this Empire
would contain above 400 Leagues at least
in the narrowest part of it, which with
the 1126 Leagues in length of our Ac∣count

of their Names, and describe the
Situation of their Countries, having seen
part of 'em my self, and receiv'd Informa∣tion
of the rest by those Indians that have
convers'd with 'em; the diversity of their
Language makes the Distinction of those
Nations, which are as large and as well
peopl'd with Inhabitants as any of those
we have seen in our whole Voyage: the
Country is so well peopl'd that their Huts
are near one another, and this not only in
the extent of one and the same Nation,
but throughout; so that the utmost Plan∣tations
of one Nation border so near to
those of another, that they can hear one
another cutting Wood from the last Vil∣lage
of one Nation into divers Plantations
of the other. This near Neighbourhood
does not at all serve to keep 'em in Amity
one with another, but on the contrary,
they are in continual War, and are daily
killing and making Slaves of one another;
this is the ordinary Misfortune of great
multitudes, and if it were not for this,
there would not be Ground enough to con∣tain
'em. They appear valiant and reso∣lute
among themselves, but yet we never
saw any in our whole Voyage who would
stand their ground against our Souldiers;
and none of these Barbarians had so much
Boldness as to put themselves in a posture
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>
of Defence, but only made use of that
shift which those that are cowardly and
faint-hearted have always imbraced, which
is to betake themselves to flight, a thing
very easy to them, because they go upon
the Water in certain little Vessels so ex∣tremely
light, that they make to the shore
as swift as Lightning; and taking these
Boats at their Backs, retire towards some
Lake, of which there are a great many
made by the River, where putting their
Vessels again into the Water, when they
are got in 'em, they defy all their Enemies
let 'em be who they will, because they

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Arms which these People use both Offen∣sive
and Defensive.</HEAD>
<P>ALL their Arms consist in Javelins of
a moderate length, and in Darts
made of very hard Wood, which they
work to so sharp a Point, that they can
easily pierce a Man through with 'em, they
throw 'em with so much dexterity. They
have besides these another sort of Wea∣pon
call'd <HI>Estolicas,</HI> in the using of which
the Souldiers of the great <HI>Irica</HI> King of
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>
<HI>Peru</HI> were very well skill'd; this is a Staff
of about six Foot long, and three Fingers
broad, made as flat as a Board; at the end
of it on one side they fix a Bone made like
a Tooth, to which they fasten an Arrow
of six Foot long, the Point whereof is
likewise headed with a Bone, or with a
very hard piece of Wood, which they cut
in the form of a barb'd Arrow-head; so
that where it hits, it remains fast, and hangs
at its whole length: they take it in their
Right-hand, with which they hold this
Weapon by the lower end, and fixing the
Arrow in the Bone that is in the upper
end of it, they cast it with so much Force
and Exactness, that they never miss doing
Execution within 50 Paces. These Wea∣pons
serve 'em for War, for Hunting, and
especially for Fishing; so that whatever
kind of Fish they can perceive in the Ri∣ver,
they shoot it, let it be never so much
cover'd under Water: and that which is
yet more to be admir'd is, that with these
Weapons they pierce Tortoises, when, af∣ter
they are run into the River to hide
themselves, they thrust their Heads out of
the Water to take breath, as they com∣monly
do from time to time after small
Intervals; they strike 'em with this Arrow
through the Neck, which is the only place
in which they can be wounded, because
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
it is not cover'd with the Shell. For De∣fensive
Weapons they make use of Tar∣gets,
which they make of Canes split in
two, and which they so fitly and closely
join one with another, that tho they are
much lighter, yet they are no less strong
than those others which they make of the
Skin of the Fish <HI>Pegebuey,</HI> of which I have
spoken before. Some of these Nations
make use only of Bows and Arrows, which
are esteem'd among all the others for the
force and swiftness of 'em. There are a∣bundance
of venomous Herbs, with which
some of these Nations make so subtile a

taking away the Life at the same time.</P>

in great Colonies, and all their Commerce

at <HI>Venice,</HI> or at <HI>Mexico,</HI> in little Barks
which they call Canoos; these they make

Wood, to plain it, and to make their

<P>ALL the Tools which they have either
to make their Canoos, to build their
Huts, or to do other necessary Jobs, are
Axes and Hatchets, not such as have been
forg'd by ingenious Smiths, but such as
have been form'd in their Fancies by Ne∣cessity,
which is the Mother of Invention,
and has taught 'em to cut the hardest part
of the Tortoise-shell (which is that under
the Belly of it) into Leaves of about a
hand's-breadth, and not quite so thick as
ones Hand. After having dry'd it in the
Smoak, they whet it upon a Stone, then
fasten it to a wooden Helve, and make use
of this Tool to cut every thing they fancy,
as well as if it were the best Ax that can
be, but with a little more pains. They
make their Hatchets of the same matter,
and the Handle they put to 'em is a <HI>Pege∣beuy</HI>'s
Jaw-bone, which Nature seems to
have purposely fitted to this use. With
these Instruments they finish all their
Works, not only their Canoos, but their
Tables, their Cupboards, their Seats, and
their other Houshold Goods, and that as
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>
compleatly as if they had the best Joiners
Tools that are in use among us. There
are some among these Nations who make
their Axes of Stones, which they grind to
an Edg with main Strength; these are
much stronger than those of Tortoise-shell,
so that they will cut down any great Tree
which they have a mind to fell, with the
less fear of breaking 'em, and with much
more speed. Their Chizzels, Plains and
Wimbles, which we use for the finest
Works of Joinery (in which they work
excellently well) are made of wild Hogs
Teeth, and of the Horns of other Animals,
which they graft in to Wooden Handles,
and make use of 'em as well as we can do

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Religion of these People, and what they
believe concerning their Idols. The Dis∣course
of a Cacique on this Subject.</HEAD>
<P>THE Religion of these barbarous
People is much alike, they all wor∣ship
Idols, which they make with their
own Hands; to one of them they ascribe
the Authority of governing the Waters,
and put a Fish in his Hand in token of his
Power; they chuse others to preside over
their Seed-time, and others to inspire 'em
with Courage in their Battels; they say
these Gods came down from Heaven on
purpose to dwell with them, and to shew
them Kindness. They don't signify their
Adoration of these Idols by any outward
Ceremonies, but on the contray, seem to
have forgotten 'em as soon as they have
made 'em, and putting them in a Case let
'em lie, without taking any notice of 'em
so long as they imagine they have no occa∣sion
for their Help; but when they are
ready to march out to War, they set up the
Idol in which they have plac'd the hopes
of their Victories, at the Prow of their
Canoos: so when they go a fishing, they
take that Idol with 'em to which they at∣tribute
the Government of the Waters;
<PB N="93" REF="53"/>
yet they have not so much Faith in any of
'em, but that they freely acknowledg
that there may possibly be a God who is
greater and more powerful than these. I
made this Judgment upon what pass'd be∣tween
us and one of these Savage People,
who yet shew'd nothing in his Conversa∣tion
that savour'd of a barbarous Educa∣tion:
This Indian had heard some of our
Men speak of the Almighty Power of
God; and considering what he had seen
with his own Eyes, that our Army had
navigated this great River throughout its
whole Course, and after having pass'd
through so many different Warlike Nati∣ons,
was return'd without having receiv'd
the least Damage or Prejudice from any of
'em, he thought this could not be, unless
the Assistance and Power of God had con∣ducted
us: upon this Imagination he came
to meet us, and with a great deal of Con∣cern
and disquiet of Mind signified to us,
that for all the kind Entertainment he had
given us, he desir'd no other Recompence
but that we would leave him one of our
Gods, seeing they were so good and pow∣erful,
that so he might take him and his
Vassals into his Protection, that he might
make 'em live in Peace and Health, and
continually give 'em whatever they stood
in need of for their Preservation. Our Men
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>
did not fail to promise him whatever he
desir'd, and would fain have set up the
Standard of the Cross in his Village for a
certain Mark. This is a Custom the Por∣tuguez
have introduc'd throughout all
places where Idols are worship'd; I know
not whether they do it from a true Princi∣ple
of Zeal, as the Action it self seems to
signify, for there is a great deal of reason
to doubt that they set up the sacred Sign
of the Cross only for a specious Pretext to
make Slaves of the poor Indians, whom
they carry away from their very Houses,
either for their own Service, or to sell 'em
to others; which gave me an extreme Com∣passion
for these People who don't seem
unteachable, and might be more easily
brought to the Knowledg of the true God
by a courteous and gentle Carriage, than
by all the Rigor that can be us'd upon 'em.
What I have said is certainly true, that
when the Portuguez have been kindly re∣ceiv'd
and well treated by these honest and
charitable Indians, they in return to all
their Hospitality only leave 'em the Sign
of the Cross, which they set up in the
most eminent place of their Habitations,
commanding 'em to keep this holy Sign
with so great Care that it may never be
defac'd; and after this when this Cross
happens either to be thrown down by the
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>
Injuries of the Weather, or to be worn
out, or it may be to be maliciously broken
in pieces by some of those Idolatrous In∣dians
who bear no respect to it, the Por∣tuguez
never fail to condemn 'em all as
guilty of the Profanation of the Cross,
and as such, declare both them and all
their Children and Childrens Children
perpetual Slaves. This was the main rea∣son
that ingag'd me to forbid the Portu∣guez
to leave the Cross among these Peo∣ple;
besides, I was not willing that this
<HI>Cacique</HI> that had ask'd us for a God, should
have any occasion to believe that our God
was a piece of Wood, and that this had
the Power and Divinity of him that sav'd
us on the Cross, for fear of confirming him
in Idolatry. I therefore comforted him the
best I could, and told him the God we
worship'd would be always with him, and
advis'd him to pray to him for whatever
he wanted, and to put his Trust intirely
in him, telling him I believ'd he would
one day favour him with the Knowledg of
the true Religion. By this it appears that
this Indian did not believe his Idols were
powerful Gods, seeing he was so ready to
forsake 'em to worship a greater Deity, if
we would have given him one.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Discourses of two other Caciques, which

<P>ANother of these Barbarians gave us
to understand that his Sentiments
were not different from those of the for∣mer
which we have been relating. This
Indian who had more Knowledg, but less
Honesty than the other, knowing that
there was no Divinity, nor any Power in
his Idols, set up himself for the God of all
his Country. We receiv'd Information of
this some Leagues before we arriv'd at the
place where he dwelt, and sent him word
that we were coming to bring him Tidings
of the true God, who was much more
powerful than he could pretend to be, and
entreated him not to retire from his House,
but to wait for our Arrival. He did so,
and we had scarce set our Feet to Land on
the shore of this Country, but he came to
us big with Curiosity to enquire what
News we could tell him of that God, a∣bout
whom we had sent such a Message to
him. I held a long Discourse with him, to
inform him what God was; but because
he would needs see with his own Eyes the
God that I preach'd to him, I was forc'd
to leave him in his own Blindness: He told
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>
me himself was God, and begotten by the
Sun; affirming that his Soul went every
Night into Heaven to give Orders for the
succeeding Day, and to regulate the Go∣vernment
of the Universe; such was the
Insolence and Pride of this Savage Crea∣ture.</P>
<P>Another of 'em shew'd himself much
more reasonable; for when I was enquiring
of him how it came to pass, that seeing his
Companions retir'd into the Mountains at
the approach of our Fleet, he alone with
a few of his Relations durst come near us,
and expose themselves to lie at our Mercy
without fear. He answer'd that he had
consider'd that such Men as had once got
up that River in spight of so many Ene∣mies,
and were return'd in like manner
without receiving any harm, could be no
less than the Lords of this great River, and
would be sure frequently to return to bring
it into Subjection, and to people it with
new Inhabitants; and the case being thus,
he was not willing to live always in fear
and dread in his House, but chose rather
to render himself to 'em in time, and wil∣lingly
to acknowledg them for his Masters
and Friends, whom the others would one
day be constrain'd to receive and serve by
Force.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Veneration they have for their Wizards,
and the Ceremonies of their Funerals.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now resume the Thred of
our History, and return to the Cus∣toms
of our Indians. 'Tis very remark∣able
how much Esteem▪ and Respect all
these Nations bear to those Wizards they
have among 'em, which proceeds not so
much from the Love they have for 'em, as
from the continual Fear they live in of re∣ceiving
some Mischief or other from their
Hands. There is a certain House devo∣ted
to the use of these Sorcerers, in which
they perform their superstitious Exercises,
and converse with the Devil, (a very com∣mon
thing with 'em in this Place) which
serves for no other purpose. They also
keep the dead Bones of these Sorcerers
with as much Veneration as if they were
the Reliques of Saints: when they have
put their Bones altogether, they hang 'em
in the Air in the same Cotton Beds those
Wizards us'd to lie in while alive. These
are their Masters, their Preachers, their
Counsellors, and their Guides: They
have recourse to them in their Doubts to
obtain the Resolution of 'em; and when
<PB N="99" REF="56"/>
they are in the greatest Rage against their
Enemies, they apply themselves to these
Conjurers for poisonous Herbs, by which
they execute their Revenge upon 'em.</P>
<P>For the Burial of their Dead there are
different Ceremonies among 'em; for
some keep 'em in their own Houses, that
by having 'em always before their Eyes,
they may (as they pretend) on all Occasi∣ons
be put in mind of Death: But certain∣ly
if they did it for this intention, one
would think they should keep the Re∣mains
of their Dead in better order than
they do. Others burn their Carcases in
great Pits, and with them all the deceased
Party possess'd when alive: But in short,
they all, one as well as another, celebrate
their Funerals for many Days together,
with continual Mourning and Weeping,
which they only interrupt with Drinking,
and that they do even to the Excess of
Drunkenness.</P>

<P>IT may be said in general, that all these

agreeable Air, and a Complexion much
less tauny than that of the <HI>Brazilians;</HI> they
have a ready Wit, and a great deal of
Dexterity in the Exercise of their Wea∣pons;
their Conversation is sweet and
peaceable, and their Inclinations very a∣greeable.
We had sufficient Opportunity
of knowing this by the Commerce we had
with many of them: For they presently
had such a good Opinion of us, that they
did not make the least difficulty of trust∣ing
their Lives and all they had besides in
our Hands. Some of them continued
with us a considerable time, eating and
drinking with our Men without shewing
the least Suspicion or Apprehension of
Danger: Nay they had the Civility to
give us their Huts to lodg in, while seve∣ral
of their Families crowded themselves
in one or two, that we might have the
Accommodation of the rest. The Indi∣ans
we had with us offer'd 'em a thousand
insolent Affronts, and we could not pos∣sibly
hinder 'em from insulting over 'em;
but they patiently bore all, and without
the least Resentment. All this, together
with the slender Veneration they seem to
have for their Idols, give us great ground
to hope, that if ever the Knowledg of the
true God of Heaven and Earth, and the

<P>WE have hitherto treated in general
of this Noble and Famous River
of <HI>Amazons;</HI> now 'tis but reasonable we
should enter upon the Detail of our Ac∣count,
and speak particularly of its Sources
and Passages: I shall therefore give a Re∣lation
of its Ports, and distinctly observe
all the Rivers that seed it, and maintain its
prodigious Greatness. I shall even ad∣vance
into all the Countries it waters: I
shall make observation of its Depths in
several Parts of it, and of the particular
Inclinations of the many sorts of People
it maintains. I design to omit nothing
that's worthy of notice, because I have
been an Eye-witness of it; and having
been sent by one of the greatest Monarchs
in Christendom, on purpose to make ac∣curate
Observations on every thing upon
this great River, it may be I am more
capable than another to give an account of
<PB N="102" REF="58"/>
what was given me in charge. I shall say
nothing of the principal Mouth of this Ri∣ver
into the Ocean on the side of <HI>Para;</HI> for
it has long since been known by all that sail
into <HI>America;</HI> it is well known that it lies
under the Line at the utmost Confines of
<HI>Brazil:</HI> Nor shall I say any thing of that
Mouth of our River by which the Tyrant
<HI>Lopez Daguyrre</HI> invaded the Island of
<HI>La Trinidada;</HI> because I never saw it, and
those that have been there have told me
there is no direct Entrance into the River
of <HI>Amazons</HI> by the Mouth, it being the
Mouth of another River that has Com∣munication
with the <HI>Amazone</HI> by several
Arms, which from one space to another
extend themselves far from it, and enter
into the Sea with this other River. My
Intention is only to give the Inhabitants
of the conquer'd Countries of <HI>Peru</HI> an ac∣count
of the Passages they have to the
River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> or rather of the Ri∣vers
of each Province that empty them∣selves
into it. I have already said, that as
we came down it we saw its Banks open'd
by many Rivers and Rivulets both on the
South and North sides: Therefore if any
embark on these Rivers, they must neces∣sarily
fall into the <HI>Amazone.</HI> But because
'tis not certainly known from what Provin∣ces
they draw their Original, and upon
<PB N="103" REF="58"/>
what Towns their Sources border; and
because 'tis yet less known in those places
whence they spring, whether they fall in∣to
this great River or no, I shall endea∣vour

particular notice of, and all that know
these Provinces will confirm the Report I
give. Three of 'em pass from the side of
the <HI>Amazone,</HI> and go down toward the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Rivers of Caqueta, Putomayo,
and Aguarcio, which come from the new

<P>THe first Entrance that we discover'd
to fall into this River (which may
be termed a Sea of fresh Water) on that
side that looks towards the new King∣dom
of <HI>Granada,</HI> is through the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Micoa</HI> in the Government of
<HI>Popayan,</HI> following the Current of the
great River <HI>Caqueta,</HI> into which all those
others that descend on the side of <HI>St. Foy,
<PB N="104" REF="59"/>
Bogota, Jimanas,</HI> and <HI>Cagnan,</HI> come to
render Homage as to their Lady and Mis∣triss.
This River is very famous in the
Countrey for the Numbers of Indians
that inhabit the Banks of it. It has a
great many Arms that extend themselves
into very remote Provinces, and return
to join themselves to that Body from which
they separated from a great multitude of
Islands, that are all inhabited by an in∣finite
number of wild People. This Ri∣ver
continually takes its Course parallel
with the <HI>Amazone,</HI> always running along
by it, tho at a considerable distance, and
from one Place to another sending Arms
of Water towards it, big enough to be
taken each of 'em for whole Rivers; at
last gathering it self together at the Lati∣tude
of four degrees, it discharges it self
into our River: and 'tis by that Arm of
it, which is nearest to the Province of the
<HI>Aquas,</HI> that one must directly take ones
Course to go down unto the <HI>Amazone,</HI>
because there are some Arms that tend to∣wards
the North; and they that shall be
so imprudent as to embark on this Arm,
will certainly be expos'd to the same Dan∣ger
that befel Capt. <HI>Fernand Perez de
Quesada,</HI> who having embarked on the
<HI>Caquetta</HI> with 300 Men, and suffered
himself to be carried along the side of <HI>St.
<PB N="105" REF="59"/>
Foy,</HI> arrived in the Province of <HI>Algodonal,</HI>
from whence he was forced to retire with
much more haste than he came, tho he
was so well attended with a good number
of Men.</P>
<P>The second most remarkable Entrance
we find on the North side is by the Town
of <HI>Pasto,</HI> which also depends on the Go∣vernment
of <HI>Popayan.</HI> From this Town
you must cross the neighbouring Moun∣tains
called the <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> which is a diffi∣cult
incommodious Journey, because of the
badness of the Ways, which you must travel
partly on Foot, and the rest on Horse-back.
You'l at length arrive at the River <HI>Puto∣mayo,</HI>
on which you must embark; and
sailing down it, it will bring into the fa∣mous
River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> at the Latitude
of two Degrees and a half, and 330
Leagues below the Port of <HI>Napo.</HI> The
same Way that leads to the River <HI>Puto∣mayo,</HI>
leads in like manner to the River
<HI>Aguarico;</HI> because when you leave the
Mountains, 'tis but turning near <HI>Succombios,</HI>
and near that Town you meet the River
<HI>Aguarico,</HI> otherwise call'd the golden River:
you need only follow the Stream of it to
enter into the <HI>Amazone,</HI> and the Entrance
of it is almost under the Line, where the
Province of the long-hair'd Indians be∣gins
ninety Leagues below the Port
<PB N="106" REF="60"/>

<P>UNder the Line there is another River,

<HI>Quixos,</HI> and is nearest to the City of <HI>Qui∣to,</HI>
beginning at the City of the <HI>Cofanes,</HI>
where it takes the Name of <HI>Coca,</HI> and
from all along hence it amasses together
such great Quantities of Water, that it
may well be said to make the principal of
all those Channels that compose this great
Fresh-water Sea. The Navigation of this
River is very troublesom and difficult, by
reason of the great Sreams of Water that
trouble it all along, till it meets the River
<HI>Napo;</HI> but this last, and the others that
enter into the <HI>Amazone</HI> on the other side
of the Line toward the South, are naviga∣ted
with much more ease. The first of
these is the River <HI>Pagamino,</HI> which is none
of the most commodious and pleasant:
it is three days Journey by Land from the

City of <HI>Avila,</HI> which likewise belongs to

by this River the Portuguez Fleet enter'd,

below the River <HI>Quito,</HI> and the <HI>Napo,</HI>
at a place call'd <HI>La Junta de los Rios,</HI>
twenty five Leagues below the Port
of <HI>Napo.</HI> When the Portuguez returned,
we found a better way to join their Fleet
than that which they lighted on in coming
into this Country: For we went strait
from <HI>Quito</HI> to <HI>Archidoua,</HI> which likewise
belongs to the Government of the <HI>Quixos,</HI>
and is under the Jurisdiction of <HI>Quito;</HI>
from whence by one day's Journey only
(which we travelled on foot, it being in
the Winter, that is in the time of the Rains,
but might be performed on Horse-back at
any other Season) we arrived at the Port
of the River <HI>Napo.</HI> This River is great and
rich, and all the Inhabitants of the neigh∣bouring
Ports under the Government of
<HI>Quito</HI> account it the Depository of their
Treasures; for they every Year gather
from its Shores all the Gold they need to
defray the Expence of their Families.
Besides, this River abounds with Fish, and
the Fields near it are full of Game; the
Soil is very good, and requires but little
Charge to cultivate it: It returns the Hus∣bandman
<PB N="108" REF="61"/>
prodigious quantities of all sorts
of Grain: This is the principal and best
Way that can be taken to go from the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Quito</HI> to the River of <HI>Amazons;</HI>
'tis much more commodious and easy
than all the rest. Yet I have heard on that
side, that near the Town of <HI>Ambatte,</HI>
which is 10 Leagues from <HI>Quito</HI> on the
River <HI>Bamba,</HI> there is another River that
comes to discharge it self into the <HI>Amazone,</HI>
and that there is in it but one fall of Wa∣ter
caus'd by the Currents, that at all ob∣structs

very commodious to bring one into this

those little Canoos the Indians use for their

six Leagues below this Port; and then all
on a sudden becomes calm and smooth,
and so remains till it enters into the River

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Place where General Texeira left his
Fleet of Portuguez.</HEAD>
<P>'TWas in this Province of the long-hair'd
Indians at the Mouth of the
River which bears their Name, and enters
into the <HI>Amazone</HI> 20 Leagues below the River
again, that by the Order of General <HI>Texeira</HI>
forty Portuguez of his Fleet, with 200 of the
Indians they brought with 'em, continued
constantly for the space of eleven Months: At
first they found nothing but good Entertain∣ment
of all sorts from the Inhabitants of the
Country, to whom in return they gave all Ne∣cessaries
they had occasion for; but this did not
continue long. This was too great a Familia∣rity
for Men that knew themselves guilty of
the death of the Spanish Captain; for they
being the Authors of this Fact, knew well e∣nough
that the Blood they had shed cry'd for
Vengeance against 'em, and therefore being un∣der
Apprehensions of being chastis'd for their
Boldness on the least occasion that should of∣fer,
they mutinied, and after they had kill'd
three of our Indians, took up Arms to defend
their Lives and Lands. The Portuguez on
this occasion acted like themselves, and pre∣sently
sought to be reveng'd; for it being
contrary to their Humour to put up Injuries,
<PB N="114" REF="64"/>
or to suffer Indians to take the liberty of act∣ing
with so much Insolence as this, they be∣took
themselves to Arms, and with their
wonted Courage, for which they are so fa∣mous,
flew upon their Enemies, and repuls'd
them with so much Vigor, that with the loss
of a very few Men they killed a considerable
number of Indians, and took above 70 of 'em
Prisoners; some of whom died in the places of
their Confinement, and the rest made their
Escape, so that in a little time there was not
one of them left. These Portuguez did not
get much by their Victory, for they now
found themselves reduc'd to such Extremity,
that they saw they must either perish for
want of Food, or else be oblig'd to go with
their Swords in their hands to fetch Provision
out of the very Mouths of their Enemies.
Accordingly they resolv'd to make Incursions
into the Country, and either by fair means or
soul to get a Supply for their pinching Neces∣sities.
Some of 'em went out to fight, and
others kept the Camp; but both the one and
the other in spite of all their Bravery did not
fail to meet with frequent and violent Insults
from their Enemies, who omitted no fit oc∣casion
to give 'em all sorts of Alarms, and to
do 'em all the Mischief they could, especially
upon the River, where they surpriz'd a great
many of their Vessels, some of which they
pillaged, and brake others of 'em in pieces:
<PB N="115" REF="64"/>
and yet this was not the greatest Damage
they did our Men; for they laid Ambuscades
for our Indians, and cut the Throats of all
that fell into their hands: 'Tis true, for eve∣ry
Man they kill'd, the Portuguez kill'd six of
them; but this Chastisement was nothing
comparable to what the Portuguez used to
make the Indians suffer for such kind of Re∣volts.
These People were call'd by the Spa∣niards
who saw them first, the Hairy Indians,
because throughout this Province the Men as
well as the Women wear their Hair quite
down to their Knees. Their Weapons are
Darts, their Houses are Huts made very neat∣ly
and curiously with the Branches of Palm-Trees:
Their Food is like that of all the o∣ther
Indians upon the <HI>Amazone.</HI> They are
always in War with their Neighbours at
the Head of this Province of the long-hair'd
Savages on the South-side; on the other side of
the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> they have for their
Neighbours the <HI>Avixiras,</HI> the <HI>Yurusnies,</HI> the
<HI>Zaparas,</HI> and the <HI>Yquitos,</HI> who are on one side
enclosed by the River <HI>Curaray,</HI> and on the o∣ther
by the <HI>Amazone,</HI> into which the former
empties it self 4 Leagues below the Province
of the long-hair'd Indians, at near two degrees
Latitude. Eighty Leagues below <HI>Curaray</HI> on
the same South-side, the famous River <HI>Tum∣buragua,</HI>
which, as I said before, descends
from the Province of the <HI>Maynas,</HI> by the
<PB N="116" REF="65"/>
Name of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> enters into the <HI>Amazone;</HI>
and is so impetuous and violent, that it pre∣serves
its Waters entirely together, while it
runs with its ordinary Swiftness several
Leagues forward into the <HI>Amazone</HI> without
mixing with it, which makes it extend above
a League in Breadth at its Mouth: at length
it acknowledges the Superiority of the <HI>Ama∣zone,</HI>
and pays it not only the ordinary Tri∣bute,
which the other Rivers render it, but
another more considerable Advantage be∣sides
of many sorts of Fish, that are not
found in the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> till you
come to the Mouth of this River.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Province of the Aguas, their Manners
and Customs.</HEAD>
<P>SIxty Leagues below the River <HI>Tumbura∣gua</HI>
begins the Province of the <HI>Aguas,</HI>
which is the most fertile and spacious of all
the Provinces we found along this great River
of <HI>Amazons;</HI> the Spaniards vulgarly call it
<HI>Omaguas,</HI> by a corruption of its proper Name,
and to make it answer to the Situation
of their Dwellings; because the Word <HI>Aguas</HI>
in their Language signifies <HI>without,</HI> or <HI>abroad.</HI>
This Province is above 200 Leagues in length,
and is so well peopled, that the Villages are
<PB N="117" REF="65"/>
situate very close one to another; so that al∣most
as soon as you are past one, you discover
another. The Breadth of this Country in
all appearance is but of small extent, it be∣ing
no greater than that of our River; for
the Habitations of these People are in all the
Islands throughout the whole Length of it,
which are in great number, and some of
which are very spacious: and considering
they are all either peopled, or at least culti∣vated
for the Sustenance of the Inhabitants,
one may easily imagine there must needs be
vast numbers of Indians in a Country that
extends 200 Leagues in Length. This Na∣tion
is the most reasonable and best civilized
of all those that dwell along this River. This
Advantage they received from those that
not long since went down amongst 'em from
the Countrey of the <HI>Quixos;</HI> where after
having had Peace with the Spaniards for a
long time, they were at last wearied with
the ill Treatment they received from 'em,
and embarking in their Canoos, suffered them∣selves
to be carried down with the Stream
of the River, till they met with other Indi∣ans
of their Nation, upon whose Strength
and Power they could rely, and accordingly
took up their Residence with 'em. These
last Comers introduc'd among the others
several things they had seen practised by the
Spaniards, and taught 'em how to live after
<PB N="118" REF="66"/>
a more civil and regular manner. They
were all clothed, both Men and Women,
with all the Decency imaginable; their Gar∣ments
are made of Cotton, of which they
gather a prodigious quantity; and they do
not only make Stuffs enough for their own
use, but make a great many to sell to their
Neighbours, who are mightily taken (and
that not without reason) with the Beauty
of those pretty Works with which they
deck their Stuffs: they make some very thin
Clothes, which are not only woven with
Threds of different Colours, but the Paint
of 'em is disposed with so much Art in the
weaving, that the different Threds can't be
distinguished one from another. They are
so submissive and obedient to their principal
Caciques, that these whom they look upon as
their Princes, need speak but a Word to have
whatever they command put in execution.</P>
<P>This whole Nation has been so long accus∣tomed
to make their Heads flat, that as soon
as their Children are born they put them in
a kind of Press; forcing Nature after this
manner with one little Board, which they hold
upon the Forehead, and another much lar∣ger,
which they put behind the Head, and
which serves them for a Cradle; and all
the rest of the Body of the new-born Infant
is as it were inclos'd with this piece of
Wood: they lay the Child upon his Back,
<PB N="119" REF="66"/>
and this Board being bound fast to that
which is upon the Forehead, they make the
Head of the Child almost as slat as ones Hand;
thus there being no room for the Head to
grow, but by spreading it self wide from
one Ear to the other, they are extremely dis∣figured
by this violent Artifice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aguas</HI> have perpetual War with se∣veral
other Nations both on the one and the
other side of the River. On the South side
among other Enemies they have the <HI>Curinas,</HI>
who are so numerous, that they not only ve∣ry
well defend themselves on the side of the
River from innumerable Multitudes of the
<HI>Aguas;</HI> but at the same time likewise sus∣tain
the Efforts and Shocks of other Nations,
that come a great way down the Countrey to
make War with them. On the North side
the <HI>Zoeunas</HI> are Enemies to the <HI>Aguas,</HI> and
are, by the Accounts I have had of them, no less
numerous, nor less stout than the <HI>Curinas;</HI>
which appears in that they maintain a War a∣gainst
a great number of Enemies, that come
down from Places a great way up in the
Country.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Love these People have for the Captives
they take in War, and the Calumny they bie
under in being reported to eat 'em.</HEAD>
<P>THese <HI>Aguas</HI> make Slaves of all the Pri∣soners
they take in War, and use 'em
for all kinds of Service; however they treat
'em with so much Love and Kindness, that
they make 'em eat with themselves; and
there's nothing in the World displeases 'em
more, than to desire 'em to sell 'em, as we
found by experience on several occasions: I
remember once at our Arrival at an Indian
Town, they received us not only with all the
Marks of Peace and Amity, but even with
all the Tokens of extraordinary Joy: They
offer'd us all they had for our Sustenance,
without requiring any thing in return: We
on our parts shewed that Civility to them that
became us; we bought their painted Cotton-Cloth,
which they very willingly parted
with; we desired 'em to sell us some Canoos,
which are better to them than the best and
swiftest Horses, and they presently offer'd
'em to us; but when we began to talk with
'em about their Slaves, and to importune 'em
to sell us some of 'em, this was to them
the most uncivil and inhumane Discourse
that could be: one of them presently gave
<PB N="121" REF="67"/>
us to understand that he would no longer keep
company with us; another shew'd himself
mightily troubled at the matter: On the one
hand they were very diligent to hide 'em
from us, on the other to get some of 'em that
were with us out of our Hands; in a word,
they gave us Signs enough to convince us,
that they had a greater esteem for their Slaves
than for all the rest of their Goods, and that
they had rather part with all they possess'd
besides than part with them. And this be∣ing
the truth of the matter, 'tis a malicious
thing of the Portuguez to report that the rea∣son
why the <HI>Aguas</HI> are unwilling to sell their
Slaves, is because they fatten 'em, and keep
'em to eat at their Feasts: This is a Calumny
they have invented, to palliate the Cruelties
they have exercised upon these poor Wretch∣es.
I may farther add, that at least as far
as concerns the Nation of the <HI>Aguas</HI> I have
found the contrary true by the Testimony of
two Indians that were Natives of <HI>Para,</HI> who
came up with the Portuguez as far as <HI>Quito,</HI>
and ran away when they were arriv'd there;
who falling into the hands of these People,
were made Slaves, and remained with them
eight Months: these assured me they had
been out with them at their Wars, and that
they never saw 'em eat any of their Enemies,
when they had taken 'em, and made Slaves
of 'em: 'twas true indeed (they said) when
<PB N="122" REF="68"/>
they had taken any of their Enemies that had
the Reputation of being Valiant and Great,
they kill'd 'em at their Feasts and Assemblies,
only out of fear of sustaining some consider∣able
Damage by 'em, if they should suffer
'em to live; but that they did not eat these
neither when they had kill'd 'em, but when
they had cut off their Heads, which they
us'd to hang up in their Huts as Trophies,
they roll'd their Bodies into the River.</P>
<P>I don't deny that there are some <HI>Caribees</HI>
in those Parts that eat their Enemies without
any Sentiments of Horror; but this is a
Custom peculiar to them, and is not practi∣sed
among other Indians. And this I de∣sire
may be taken notice of and credited, that
Human Flesh has never been sold in any of
the Publick Shambles of this Nation, as the
Portuguez have reported; who under the
pretence of revenging such kind of Cruel∣ties,
commit those that are incomparably
greater themselves, since they are so inhu∣man
and barbarous, as to make Slaves of
those that were born free and independent.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The great Cold in those parts under the Line in
June, July and August, and the reason of it.</HEAD>
<P>AFter we were got down about 100
Leagues more or less into the Country
of the <HI>Aguas,</HI> and so had pass'd about half
way through this vast Province, we arriv'd at
a Town of this Nation, where we were ob∣liged
to continue three days; we there felt it
so extreme cold, that those of us that were
born and bred in the coldest Province of
<HI>Spain,</HI> were constrain'd to put on more
Clothes. This so sudden change of the Tem∣per
of the Air surpriz'd me, and gave me the
Curiosity to enquire the Cause of it, of the
People of the Country: they told me it was
no unusual thing in their Quarters, that every
Year for three Moons (for thus they count
and mean for three Months) they felt the
same Cold; these three Months are <HI>June,
July</HI> and <HI>August:</HI> but this Answer did not sa∣tisfy
me, who was willing to have a more solid
and perfect knowledg of the reason of this so
piercing Cold. Upon Consideration I found
that the Winds passing through that vast and
mountainous Desert, which is situate a great
way up in the Country on the South-side, all
those three Months, and so bringing along
with them the cold Air occasion'd by the
<PB N="124" REF="69"/>
Snow with which those Desert Mountains
are cover'd, cause these surprizing Effects in
the Neighbouring Countries under the Tor∣rid
Zone. And for this reason I don't questi∣on
but the Situation of this Country is capa∣ble
of making the Ground produce good
Wheat, and all other sorts of Grain and
Fruits, that grow in the Soil of <HI>Quito,</HI> which
is in like manner situated under the Line, or
very near it, and yet is made very fertile and
fit for all sorts of Grain and Fruits, and this
by reason of that fresh Air brought thither
by the Winds that come off from the Moun∣tains
which are cover'd with Snow.</P>

<P>SIxteen Leagues below the place where

we met with the great River <HI>Putomayo,</HI>
which is so famous in the Government of <HI>Po∣payan</HI>
in the new Kingdom of <HI>Granada.</HI> This
is a very great and wide River, because it
receives 30 other very considerable Rivers be∣fore
it falls into the <HI>Amazone.</HI> Those that in∣habit
the places about its Mouth call it <HI>Iza,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="69"/>
it comes down from the Mountains of <HI>Pasto</HI>
in the Kingdom of <HI>Granada:</HI> there's abun∣dance
of Gold found in the Sand and Gravel
of it; and we were assur'd that the Banks of
it were extremely well peopled, so that a
Troop of Spanish Souldiers coming upon this
River, found Enemies enow to constrain 'em
to retire with some loss. The Names of the
Natives that inhabit these Parts are the <HI>Yuri∣nas,</HI>
the <HI>Guaraicas,</HI> the <HI>Parianas,</HI> the <HI>Zyas,</HI>
the <HI>Ahyves,</HI> the <HI>Cuvos;</HI> and those that are

River, as being the Lords and Masters of it,
and are call'd the <HI>Omaguas;</HI> the <HI>Aguas</HI> of the

<P>Fifty Leagues below this Mouth of <HI>Puto∣mayo,</HI>
we found on the other side the Mouth
of another fine large River, which takes its
Rise near <HI>Cusco,</HI> and enters into the <HI>Amazone</HI>
at the Latitude of three degrees and a half;
the Natives call it <HI>Yosau,</HI> and 'tis esteem'd a∣bove

the <HI>Conomamas,</HI> the <HI>Mariavas,</HI> and the

dwell upon this River towards <HI>Peru,</HI> and by
consequence are the nearest Neighbours the

to be very rich in Gold, because they
<PB N="126" REF="70"/>
wear great Plates of Gold hanging at their
Ears and Nostrils: and if I don't mistake,
these Indians are the same with those I have
read of in the History of the Tyrant <HI>Lopez

miss'd his way, and instead of taking the
River <HI>Yotau,</HI> sail'd upon an Arm of another
River which enters into the <HI>Amazone</HI> some
Leagues below the other; so that when he
was fallen down into the <HI>Amazone,</HI> he found
himself so far below these People, whose
Country he went to discover, that he per∣ceiv'd
it impossible to get up to 'em, not only
because of the Impetuosity of the Currents,
against which he was afraid to hazard him∣self,
but likewise because of the Discontent
all his Souldiers express'd at so difficult an
Enterprize. This River <HI>Yotau</HI> abounds with
Fish, and its Banks with all sorts of Venison

not get clear of 'em in half a day. We found
abundance of those Villages without one Soul

to expect from us, was to be all made Slaves:
The greatest part of 'em retir'd as far as the

that they may well be term'd the
greatest Cowards upon the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI>
yet we saw in all their Houses the Marks of
a great deal of good Husbandry and Neat∣ness;
for we found abundance of Provisions
which they had laid up in store, and which
is more, a great deal of Houshold-goods, a∣mongst
which, the Vessels they had made to
eat and drink in, were the neatest and most
commodious of any we had yet seen through
the whole Course of this great River. They
have in the Marshy Places where they dwell,
a sort of Earth very good to make all kinds
of Vessels; of this they make great Pots or
Jars, in which they make their Drink and
knead their Dough, and Pans and Pots to boil
<PB N="130" REF="72"/>
in, and a sort of Ovens in which they bake
their Bread; they likewise make Drinking-Cups
and Basons of it, and very neat Frying-pans:
They make great quantities of all these
Utensils to carry on the Trade they have with
all the neighbouring Nations, who having
occasion for all these pieces of Houshold-stuff
come from all Quarters to procure 'em in this
Country, and carry them away in great Bur∣dens,
giving in exchange for 'em all sorts of

the Portuguez of our Fleet met with in

pieces of Gold there, which these People had

<P>THE Portuguez Fleet, as they came from

So that if the Portuguez pretend to give a

from what they have learn'd of the Indians

Grains of a good alloy; they beat these small
Grains of Gold together till they form those
little Plates which they hang at their Ears
and Noses, as we have said before. The
People of this Country that find this Gold,
trade with it among their Neighbours, who
are call'd the <HI>Mavagus;</HI> as for the other they
are call'd the <HI>Yuma Guaris,</HI> which is as much
as to say, the Metal-gatherers; for <HI>Yuma</HI>
signifies Metal, and <HI>Guaris</HI> those that gather
it up: and under this general Name of <HI>Yuma</HI>
they understand all sorts of Metals, there∣fore
they call'd all the Iron Tools that we
had, as Axes, Hatchets, Bills, and Knives,
by the same Name of <HI>Yuma.</HI> The way of
getting to this place seem'd to me to be very
troublesome and difficult, because of chang∣ing
the Rivers so many times, and of making
so long a Journey across the Country; which
<PB N="133" REF="73"/>
giving me no satisfaction, I could not be at
rest till I had discover'd an Advantage more
easily attainable, of which I shall discourse

<P>THese Savages go all naked both Men

serve 'em for a small Ornament with which
they deck their Ears and Noses; for they put
the Gold they get out of the Mines to no o∣ther
use than that of adorning themselves:
they all generally have their Ears bored for
this end, and they affect to have the Holes
made so vastly wide, that one may almost
thrust ones Fist through the Hole in the tips
of some of their Ears; this is the place at
which they hang their Jewels, and they com∣monly
wear in them a handful of Leaves
made up close together, to keep their Ears
constantly in the same Figure. This passes
among 'em for the greatest piece of Finery
in the World. On the other side of the <HI>Ama∣zone,</HI>
over against this high Country which

all intersected with Rivers (and particu∣larly

<P>TWo and twenty Leagues below this

on this great River: The Houses joined to
one another, and continued so to do above a
League in length: each of these Houses con∣tains
not only one Family, as is customary in
most Cities in <HI>Europe,</HI> but in those that were
least filld there dwelt 4 or 5 entire Families, and
more in the greatest part of 'em. By this may
be conjectur'd what an incredible multitude
of people must needs live in that one Town.
We went to their Houses, and found all there
in profound Peace. They waited for our
coming, without being at all alarm'd by it,
and furnished us with all necessary Provisi∣ons,
which our Fleet began now to want.
We continued five days in this Place, and
stor'd our selves here with a Provision of
above five hundred Measures of Meal of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Meal of <HI>Magnioc</HI> the Author speaks of, is bak'd and eaten instead of Bread or <HI>Cassave,</HI> as well in this Coun∣try he speaks of, as on almost all the Coasts of <HI>Brazil,</HI> where the Captains of Ships store themselves with it, when they are in want of Bisquet. This kind of Meal will not only keep good oftentimes as far as <HI>Portugal,</HI> but will sometimes serve again in other Voyages, when they are over-stock'd with it. It has this Property with it, that 'tis more fit for long Voyages than <HI>Cassave,</HI> because it keeps better. 'Tis true it becomes very in∣sipid at last, and so would the best Bread we make, if kept as long. And 'tis further to-be noted, that this bak'd Meal can't be made into Bread, and that the Indi∣ans bake it in great Earthen Basons over the Fire almost as Confectioners do their Sweat-meats; after which they dry it yet more in the Sun, when 'tis prepar'd for long Voyages. When you are past the River of <HI>Ama∣zons,</HI> the Indians on the other side of the Line know neither how to make it, nor the use of it; they only make <HI>Cassave,</HI> which is Bread made of this same Meal of <HI>Magnioc</HI> before it is bak'd: There is also a particular way of preparing that to make it keep well for long Voyages, but not so well as this bak'd Meal.</NOTE> <HI>Magnioc;</HI> so that we had more than e∣nough

<P>THirty two Leagues below the Mouth

another River on the North-side, call'd <HI>Ba∣surara</HI>
by the Natives: This River extends it
self a great way up in the Country, and
forms several great Lakes, so that the Coun∣try
is divided into divers large Islands, which
are all peopled with an infinite Number of
Inhabitants. These Lands lie very high,
and are never overflow'd by the Inundations,
let them be never so great. This Country
abounds with all sorts of Provision, as <HI>Maze,
Magnioc,</HI> all kinds of Fruit, Venison, Wild-Fowl,

liberal Maintenance; which makes it abound
as much in Men as in all other things. All

this Country are call'd by the general Name
of <HI>Carabuyavas,</HI> and are divided into parti∣cular
Provinces, some of which are call'd
the <HI>Ceraguanas,</HI> &amp;c. All the Indians use
Bows and Arrows; and among some of
them I saw Iron Tools and Weapons, as
<PB N="144" REF="79"/>
Hatchets, Halbards, Bills and Knives. I
asked them, by our Interpreters, from
whence they had those Instruments of Iron:
they answered, that they bought them of
the People of that Country that dwelt near∣est
the Sea on that side, who had their Goods
in exchange for 'em; that they were white
Men like us, and made use of the same Arms,
as Swords and Guns, and had Houses upon
the Sea-Coast; that the only difference be∣tween
them and us was, that they had all
light-colour'd Hair. These Tokens were
sufficient to assure us that these were the
Dutch that were in possession of the Mouth
of the Smooth River, or the River <HI>Philippe,</HI>
some time before. It was in the Year 1638,
that they made a Descent into <HI>Guiana,</HI> which

themselves Masters of the whole Island,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Guiana</HI> is a considerable part of the Continent, and not one of the Islands of the Ocean, as our Author seems to signify in this place; yet it may well enough be said, that he spake more truly than he thought, and that the River <HI>Orenoque,</HI> or <HI>Paria,</HI> parting from the River of <HI>A∣mazons,</HI> to come afterwards to discharge it self into the Sea over against the Island of <HI>La Trinidada,</HI> betwixt the ninth and tenth Degrees of Northern Latitude; it may very well be, I say, that <HI>Guiana</HI> by these means becomes an Island, comprehending all that Extent of Land be∣tween the Mouth of <HI>Orenoque</HI> and that of the <HI>Amazone,</HI> quite to the place where these two great Rivers divide to take their Course asunder, till they fall into the Sea at above 300 Leagues distance one from another.

promised themselves a great Ransom from us
to get this holy Pledg out of their hands,
knowing what Respect and Love the Catho∣licks
have for the precious Body of their Sa∣viour;
but our Men took another Course,
which was, to betake themselves to their
Arms, and compose good Companies of
Souldiers who were resolved to go with the
Courage of Christians to expose their Lives

that they look black again: and of a fit
Place to fortify upon this River, which
would be a means to obtain the Sovereignty
of the Amazone by the way to it from the
North-Cape through the River call'd Rio∣grande.</HEAD>
<P>ON the same North-side, thirty Leagues
or something less from <HI>Basurara,</HI> we
met with the largest Mouth, and the finest
River of any that come to throw themselves
into the <HI>Amazone.</HI> It runs a Course of 1300
Leagues in length; the Mouth of it is a
League and a half wide, which is at the
Latitude of four degrees; and to speak a lit∣tle
pleasantly, one may say, this mighty Ri∣ver
is so haughty, that 'tis offended to meet
with a greater than it self; and as the incom∣parable
<HI>Amazone</HI> stretches out its Arms to re∣ceive
it, this proud River disdains to be so
embrac'd as to lose it self in the other's Wa∣ters,
and therefore keeps separated from it,
and fills up half the Bed of the <HI>Amazone</HI> it
self for above the length of twelve Leagues,
so that the Waters of the one may be easily
distinguished from the other by those that
sail in this Channel. The Portuguez had
<PB N="147" REF="80"/>
some Reason to call this the <HI>Black River,</HI> be∣cause
at its Mouth, and many Leagues above,
its Depth, together with the Clearness of
those Waters which are pour'd into its Chan∣nel
from several great Lakes, make it ap∣pear
black, as if it were dyed, tho when it is
put in a Glass it looks as clear as Crystal. It
takes its Course from West to East at its be∣ginning,
but has such great Windings, that
in a very little space it changes its Course to
different Points; but the Course it runs for
several Leagues before it empties it self into
the <HI>Amazone,</HI> is again from West to East.
The Indians that live upon the Banks of it
call it <HI>Curiguarura;</HI> but the <HI>Toupinambous,</HI>
of whom we shall speak presently, give it
the name of <HI>Ʋrama;,</HI> which signifies [<HI>Black
Water</HI>] in their Language. They also give
another name to the <HI>Amazone,</HI> which it re∣tains
in those Parts, namely, <HI>Pajanaquris,</HI>
which is as much as to say [<HI>the Great River],</HI>
to distinguish it from another, which tho it
be a great River, however is much less than
this, and named <HI>Pajanamira,</HI> which enters
into the <HI>Amazone</HI> on the South-side, a League
below the <HI>Black River.</HI> We were assur'd
that this River was inhabited by a great
number of People of different Nations, the
last of which wear Clothes and Hats like
ours, which sufficiently convinc'd us that
th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se People were not remote from our Ci∣ties
<PB N="148" REF="81"/>
in <HI>Peru.</HI> Those that dwell on the Banks
of the Black River, possess a great deal of
Ground; they are call'd <HI>Canicuaris</HI> and <HI>Curu∣patabas;</HI>
and the last Nation is that of the
<HI>Quaravaquazanas,</HI> that dwell upon one Arm
of the Black River: and 'tis by this Arm,
as we were sufficiently inform'd, that one
may pass into the <HI>Riogrande,</HI> the Mouth of
which goes into the Sea at the North-Cape,
near which River the Dutch have established
themselves.</P>
<P>All these Nations make use of Bows and
Arrows, the most of which they poison with
the Juice of Herbs. All the Lands upon this
Black River are situate very high, the Soil is
very good, and if manur'd, would yield
plenty of all sorts of Fruit (even such as we
have in <HI>Europe</HI>) in some places that lie well
to produce 'em. There are a great many
fine and pleasant Fields all cover'd with ex∣cellent
Pasturage sufficient to nourish an in∣numerable
stock of all sorts of Cattle. There
are likewise abundance of good Trees, the
Timber of which is very good for all sorts of
Carpenters Work, whether for Land or
Water: And besides this great plenty of
Wood, the Country yields very good Stones,
and that in vast Quantities, fit for the noblest
Buildings. The Borders of it are stor'd with
all sorts of Game. Indeed it has but a few
Fish in comparison with the River of <HI>Ama∣zons;</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="81"/>
the reason of which is from the ex∣ceeding
Clearness of the Water: But to
make amends for this Defect, the Lakes
which are in the Country, and pour their
Waters into this River, yield the Inhabi∣tants
more Fish than they need. This River
has at the Mouth of it the best Situation in
the World for the making of a Fort, and
plenty of Stones to build it, which would
be very proper to hinder our Enemies from
coming by this River to enter into the great
Channel of the <HI>Amazone;</HI> not that I think
this to be the best place of all for a Fortifica∣tion
for such a purpose, but rather several
Leagues above this Mouth, in an Arm that
goes to cast it self into the River call'd <HI>Riogrande,</HI>
whose Mouth (as I have already
said) is in the North Sea: there we might
place all our Forces with the greatest Cer∣tainty
of entirely stopping the Passage of our
Enemies into this new World, which they
so passionately desire to discover; and which
they will some time or other attempt, if
they are not prevented by securing this Pas∣sage.
I dare not affirm that this River call'd
the <HI>Riogrande,</HI> into which the Arm of the
Black River enters, is the Smooth River, or
the <HI>Philippe,</HI> for both enter into the Sea to∣ward
the North Cape; but by all the Ob∣servations
I have made, I am very inclin∣able
to believe that it is the River <HI>Philippe,</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="82"/>
because 'tis the first considerable River that
enters into the Sea beyond the Cape. But
this I know for certain, that the <HI>Riogrande</HI> is
not the River <HI>Orenoque,</HI> because the princi∣pal
Mouth of it into the Sea is over against
the Island of <HI>La Trinidada,</HI> which is above a
hundred Leagues below the Place where the
<HI>Philippe</HI> empties it self into the Sea. It was
by this River that the Tyrant <HI>Lopez Daguirre</HI>
pass'd into the North Sea; and seeing he
made this Voyage very well, some body else
may as well succeed in the same Attempt,
and follow the Course which another has
steer'd before him.</P>

they immediately resolv'd to speak
their Minds to their General, and to engage
him one way or other to fall in with their De∣signs.</P>
<P>No sooner had they taken up this Resolu∣tion,
but they addressed themselves to him,
telling him, it was needless for them to re∣present
to him the miserable Condition they
were in, since he knew it as well as them∣selves;
that they had now been for two
Years roving up and down upon these Ri∣vers,
<PB N="152" REF="83"/>
where they were every day in danger
of perishing, either by Hunger or excessive
Labour, or by the Arrows of the Savages;
and therefore begg'd him to compassionate
their Necessity, and not to take it amiss that
they sought some Relief; that they were sure
that only along the Black River they could
get as many of those Slaves which the Indi∣ans
had taken in War, as would turn to a
considerable account to them; and tho they
should bring nothing home from their Voy∣age
but these Slaves, they hop'd they should
not be ill receiv'd by their Friends at <HI>Para,</HI>
but that if they should return home empty-handed,
and should bring no Slaves with
them after they had pass'd through so many
populous Provinces, the Inhabitants of which
durst come to their very Doors to make
Slaves of them, they should be reckon'd the
most cowardly and infamous Wretches in
the World.</P>
<P>The General considering he was but one
against a great many, and perceiving a Mu∣tiny
was already form'd in the Minds of the
Souldiers, thought it not his best way to irri∣tate
them any more, but gave 'em permission
to put this Enterprize in execution, seeing
the Wind favour'd their Entrance into the
Black River, and seem'd to invite 'em to this
Project. The Portuguez were transported
with Joy that they had obtain'd this Leave,
<PB N="153" REF="83"/>
and there was not one amongst 'em but pro∣mis'd
himself at least 300 Slaves for his share.
This Resolution gave me no small Uneasiness,
for I did not well know what were the Ge∣neral's
true Sentiments of this Attempt; but
I soon found both that he had Courage and
a great deal of Generosity, and that he
was a mortal Enemy of such Violences as
the Souldiers were going to commit; for my
part, by the Grace of God, I thought my
self strong enough not to need fear any thing,
and therefore made a firm Resolution with
my self, rather to die a thousand times if it
were possible, than consent to any thing
that would be against the Glory of God, or
against the Service of his Catholick Majesty.
At the same time I went to celebrate the holy
Mass, and after I had done, I retir'd with my
Comrade, that we might consult together
by what means to hinder so barbarous and
diabolical Resolution; and we agreed to make
an open Protestation against their Rashness
and Disobedience.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Order given to the Fleet to set sail, which
was done without noise. And of the River

that inhabit its Banks, from whence
there is a short cut to the Mountain Potosi.</HEAD>
<P>I Communicated our Resolution to the Ge∣neral,
who was very glad to find me of
his Mind, but confess'd nothing could be
more bold than my Protestation. However,
he gave signal Proof of the greatness of his
Courage on this occasion; for he caus'd the
Paper containing my Protestation to be pub∣lish'd
through the Fleet, at the same time
commanding the Sea-men to furl the Sails,
and to put all things in readiness to pass out of
the Black River the next day, and to return
into the <HI>Amazone</HI> to finish our Voyage. This
Order was put in execution, for we went back
the day following; and continuing our Course
40 Leagues lower on the South-side, we found
the great River of <HI>Wood,</HI> which is a Name
the Portuguez gave it when they came from
<HI>Para,</HI> because of the vast quantity of pieces
of Timber this River carried down with it:
But the proper Name of it among the Indians
that dwell near it is <HI>Cayari;</HI> it comes (as I
have said) from the South-side, and, as we
were told, is form'd of two great Rivers,
<PB N="155" REF="84"/>
which meet together some Leagues above the
Mouth of it. And in all probability, seeing
it was by this River that the <HI>Toupinambous</HI>
came down into this Country, one may ven∣ture
to affirm, that there is no shorter and
surer way to come at the Province of <HI>Potosi,</HI>
than by the way of this River. There are
many Nations inhabiting the shores of it;
the first on the side of the Mouth of it are
the <HI>Zurinas,</HI> and the <HI>Cayanas,</HI> and above them
are the <HI>Ʋrarchaus,</HI> the <HI>Anamaris,</HI> the <HI>Guari∣numas,</HI>
the <HI>Curanaris,</HI> the <HI>Pepunacas,</HI> and the
<HI>Abacaris.</HI> From the Mouth of this River as
you go down the <HI>Amazone</HI> you meet with
the <HI>Zapucayas,</HI> and the <HI>Wbaringas,</HI> who are
excellent Workmen in Wood: below them
are the <HI>Guaranaquacos,</HI> the <HI>Maraguas,</HI> the

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Island of the Toupinambous, who
came out of Brazil when it was conquer'd by
the Portuguez, and made themselves Masters
of this Island.</HEAD>
<P>TWenty eight Leagues below the River
<HI>Cayari,</HI> as we continued our Course on
the <HI>Amazone</HI> on the South-side, we arriv'd at
<PB N="156" REF="85"/>
a great Island 60 Leagues in breadth, and
consequently above 200 Leagues in compass.
This whole Island is peopled with the va∣liant
<HI>Toupinambous,</HI> who when <HI>Brazil</HI> was
conquer'd, voluntarily exil'd themselves from
their Country, choosing rather to quit all the
Province of <HI>Fernambuco</HI> than to lose their
Liberty, and to submit themselves to the se∣vere
Government of the Portuguez: They
left above 84 great Villages where they had
planted themselves, and came away so uni∣versally,
that there was not one living Soul
left in all their Houses. They took their
way on the left-hand of those great Moun∣tains
call'd <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> which begin at the
Strait of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and cross through all
Southern <HI>America,</HI> from North to South.
They pass'd all the Rivulets and Rivers that
descend from those Mountains to discharge
themselves into the Ocean. Some of 'em
came as far as <HI>Peru,</HI> and dwelt with the Spa∣niards
towards the Source of the River <HI>Cay∣ari:</HI>
they continued with 'em some time; but
a Spaniard having caus'd one of 'em to be
whipp'd for killing a Cow, they could not
put up this Injury, but resolv'd all to be gone;
and making use of the Advantage of the Ri∣ver,
they all embark'd in their Canoos and
went down it as far as this great Island,
where they now dwell. They speak the ge∣neral
Language of <HI>Brazil,</HI> which extends
<PB N="157" REF="85"/>
through all the Country that the Portuguez
have conquer'd as far as <HI>Maragnon</HI> and <HI>Para:</HI>
They told us, that when their Fathers left
<HI>Brazil,</HI> not knowing how to get Sustenance
all together in the Desarts through which
they were to pass, they were constrain'd du∣ring
a March of above 900 Leagues to sepa∣rate
by reason of their multitude, so that
some went one way, and some another; and
by this means all the Mountains of <HI>Peru</HI> call'd
the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> are peopled with the <HI>Toupi∣nambous.</HI>
This is a very brave and valiant
Nation of Indians, as they made themselves
appear to be to the People whom they found
in this Island, where they are at present esta∣stlish'd.
For in all appearance these <HI>Toupi∣nambous</HI>
were very few in comparison of the
Inhabitants of this Island when they arriv'd
there, yet 'tis certain they so often beat, and
so entirely subdued all those they fought
with, that after they had destroy'd whole
Nations, they forc'd the rest to leave their
Native Country in fear, and to go and plant
themselves in very distant Regions. These
Warlike Savages use Bows and Arrows with
great dexterity, and have so noble a Courage,
and Greatness of Mind, that in these Quali∣ties
they seem not to come behind the most
accomplish'd Nations in <HI>Europe.</HI> But tho al∣most
all of 'em are but the Children or Grand∣children
of those that came from <HI>Brazil</HI> into
<PB N="158" REF="86"/>
this Island, yet it is to be observ'd that they
begin to degenerate from their Ancestors, by
the Alliances they contract with those of
this Country, and by their accustoming them∣selves
to the manner of living us'd by the
original Inhabitants. They all receiv'd us
with Demonstrations of extraordinary Joy;
and let us know, that they thought to re∣solve
in a little time to enter into a Treaty
with us, and to put themselves in the num∣ber
of the Allies and Friends of the People
of <HI>Para.</HI> This Declaration of theirs pleas'd
me very much, and made me hope that no
small Advantages would accrue to our Na∣tion
by it: For if these valiant People once
become of our Party, it must needs be an
easy matter for us to bring all the other
Nations of the River of <HI>Amazons</HI> to reaso∣nable
Terms, since there is none of 'em but
tremble at the very Name of the <HI>Toupi∣nambous.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Ingenuity of the Toupinambous; of
their Language; and the Account we received
of the Salt-Pits in Peru.</HEAD>
<P>THese <HI>Toupinambous</HI> are a very ingenious
and intelligent People; and having
no need of Interpreters to treat with them,
<PB N="159" REF="86"/>
because (as I have said) they speak the ge∣neral
Language of <HI>Brazil,</HI> which many of
our Portuguez, that have been born and bred
there, speak as well as they, we had the
Advantage of a very particular Account of
divers things, which I am going to relate,
and which may be believed on their Report,
because they are a People that have rov'd a∣broad,
and subjected all the neighbouring
Countries to their Power. They told us,
that on the South-side near their Island there
are two Nations among others upon the Con∣tinent
that are very remarkable; one of 'em
are Dwarfs as small as little Children, and
are called <HI>Guayazis,</HI> the other is a Race of
People that come into the World with their
Feet turn'd behind 'em, so that those that
are unacquainted with their monstrous Shape,
and should follow their Track, would run
from 'em instead of overtaking 'em; they
are called <HI>Matayus,</HI> and are tributary to the
<HI>Toupinambous,</HI> whom they are obliged to
furnish with Hatchets made of Stone to fell
great Trees with, when they have a mind to
clear a Piece of Ground; for they frame
these Hatchets very neatly, and 'tis their
whole business to make of 'em. They told
us moreover, that on the other side of the
River, that is Northward, there are seven
Provinces adjoining one to another, which are
very populous; but because they are a Peo∣ple
<PB N="160" REF="87"/>
but of mean Courage and Strength, and
only feed upon Fruits and some small wild
Animals, without ever fighting one with a∣nother
when they are angry, or ever taking
up Arms to defend themselves from other
Nations, they are of no account in the Coun∣try.
They further told us, that themselves
had been a long time at Peace with another
Nation, whose Confines extend to those we
have just spoken of, and had a regular Trade
with 'em for all Commodities, wherewith
either Countrey abounded; and that the
principal thing they had from this People
was Salt, for which they gave 'em other
things in exchange; and that this Salt came
from a Place not far distant from 'em. If this
be true, these Salt-pits would be of great
advantage to the Spaniards, and would serve
'em not only for those parts of the Countrey
that are conquer'd, but also for the more
commodious establishing of Colonies on the
Banks of this great River. But if there
should be nothing in this Story on this side,
it is not to be doubted but Salt is to be found
in great abundance along those Rivers that
come down on the side of <HI>Peru;</HI> because in
the Year 1631, when I was in the City of
<HI>Lima,</HI> two Men went from thence at two
different times to seek some, and came back
with as much as they could carry: they told
us they came to a certain Place, where they
<PB N="161" REF="87"/>
went on one of the Rivers (in all appearance
one of those lesser Rivers that form that great
one, which falls into the <HI>Amazone</HI>) and arrived
at a Mountain all of Salt, of which the Inhabi∣tants
made great advantage, being become ve∣ry
rich by the Traffick they had in exchange
for it from those Indians that came a great
way to buy it; not that it is any strange thing
in <HI>Peru,</HI> and in all the Mountains, to see
Rocks of Salt-stones, the Salt of which is
very good; for no other is made use of in all
that Countrey: 'Tis got out of the Rock
with Iron Instruments in great pieces, each
of which weigh 5 or 6<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Aroba</HI> is a Weight of 25 Pounds, as the <HI>Quintal</HI> is of a 100 Pounds.</NOTE> <HI>Arobas.</HI> This Pro∣vince
of the <HI>Toupinambous</HI> is sixty six Leagues
in length, and ends with a great Town si∣tuated
at the Latitude of 3 Degrees, as is
also the first Town of the Indian <HI>Aguas,</HI> of
which we have spoken before.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Amazons, an Account of their Man∣ners

<P>THese <HI>Toupinambous</HI> likewise confirm'd
the Report which is spread through∣out
this great River of the Renown'd <HI>Ama∣zons,</HI>
from whence it borrows its true Name,
<PB N="162" REF="88"/>
by which it has been known from the very
first Discovery of it to this day, not only by
those who have navigated it, but also by all
Cosmographers who have given any good
account of it. It would be very strange if
the Name of <HI>Amazone</HI> should have been im∣pos'd
on this River without any reasonable
Ground; and that tho it well deserves a
Name that might render it famous, it should
only be known by a fabulous one: This does
not seem at all probable that such a River as
this, that possesses so many Advantages above
all others, should have deriv'd its Glory from
a Title that does not belong to it; like what
we see in some Men, who when they have
not Vertue enough to obtain the Glory they
desire by their own Merit, are so mean spi∣rited
and disingenuous to deck themselves
with the advantageous Qualities of others:
But the Proofs that give assurance that
there is a Province of <HI>Amazons</HI> on the Banks
of this River, are so strong and convincing,
that it would be a renouncing of moral Cer∣tainty
to scruple the giving credit to it. I
don't build upon the solemn Examinations
made by the Authority of the Soveraign Court
of <HI>Quito,</HI> in which many Witnesses have been
heard that have been born in those Parts,
and liv'd there a long time; and of all things
contain'd in their Frontier Countries, one of
the principal which is particularly affirm'd
<PB N="163" REF="88"/>
by 'em is, that one of those Provinces near
our River is peopled with a sort of warlike
Women, who live together, and maintain
their Government alone, without the Com∣pany
of Men; that at a certain Season of
the Year they seek the Society of Men in or∣der
to perpetuate their Race; but at all other
times live together in their Towns, and im∣ploy
themselves in manuring the Ground,
from which with hard Labour they procure
all Necessaries for the Support and Comfort
of Life. Nor will I insist on other Infor∣mations
that have been made in the new
Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> at the Royal Seat of
the City of <HI>Pasto,</HI> where several Indians
were examined, and particularly one Indian
Woman, who affirm'd that she had been in
the very Countrey which these valiant Wo∣men
inhabit, and whose Account was in
every respect conformable to what had been
before asserted in the foregoing Relations:
but I can't conceal what I have heard with
my own Ears, and the Truth of which I
have been enquiring after from my first em∣barking
on the <HI>Amazone;</HI> and I must say I
have been inform'd at all the Indian Towns
where I have been, that there are such Wo∣men
in the Countrey as I have above descri∣bed;
and every one that gave me an ac∣count
of 'em did it by Characters so exactly
agreeing with the rest, that if there be no∣thing
<PB N="164" REF="89"/>
in it, it must needs be said that the
greatest Lie in the World passes throughout
all <HI>America</HI> for one of the most certain Histo∣rical
Truths. However we had the clearest
Information of the Province where these
Women dwell, of their singular Customs,
of the Indians that correspond with them, of
the Ways into their Country, and of those
Indians with whom they converse to prevent
the Extinction of their Race in the last Vil∣lage,
which makes the Frontier Town be∣tween
them and the <HI>Toupinambous.</HI></P>

<P>THirty six Leagues below this utmost

go down our Great River, you meet with
another on the North-side, which comes
from the very Province of the <HI>Amazons,</HI>
and is known among the People of the
Country by the Name of <HI>Cunuris.</HI> This
River bears the Name of those Indians that
dwell nearest to the Mouth of it: Above
these first People higher up the River <HI>Cunu∣ris</HI>
you meet with other Indians call'd <HI>Apotos,</HI>
that speak the general Language of <HI>Brazil;</HI>
higher still you find the <HI>Tagaris,</HI> and lastly
the <HI>Guacaras,</HI> who are the People that have
<PB N="165" REF="89"/>
the Privilege to converse with these valiant
Women, and enjoy their Favours. They
dwell upon huge Mountains, that are pro∣digiously
high, among which there is one
that lifts its Head a great Height above all
the rest, which is so buffeted with Winds,
that it is quite barren, and looks very bare;
the Name of it is <HI>Yacamiaba.</HI> These Wo∣men
(as has been said) are very couragious,
and have always maintain'd themselves alone
without the help and assistance of Men; and
when their Neighbours come into their Coun∣trey
at a time concerted with them, they re∣ceive
'em with their Weapons in their Hands,
which are Bows and Arrows, and which
they exercise as if they were going against
their Enemies; but knowing well that the
others don't come to fight, but are their
Friends, they lay down their Arms, and all
run into the Canoos or other little Vessels of
these Indians, and each <HI>Amazone</HI> takes the
Hammock (a Cotton Bed they hang up to
sleep in) which she finds next at hand; this
she carries home, and hangs up in a Place,
where the Owner of it may know it again
when he comes; after which she receives
him as her Guest, and treats him those few
days they continue together. These In∣dians
afterward return to their own Dwel∣lings,
and never fail to make this Voyage
every Year at the appointed time. The
<PB N="166" REF="90"/>
Girls which they bear are brought up by
their Mothers, and instructed in the use of
Arms, as well as inur'd to Labour, as if they
were ambitious to advance the wonted Va∣lour
of their Predecessors still to a greater
Height. As for the Male-Children, 'tis not
certain what they do with 'em: I saw an
Indian who told me, that when he was a
Child he was with his Father at such an En∣terview,
and assured me, that they gave the
Male Children to their Fathers the next
time they came after their Birth. But the
common Report is, that they kill all their
Males as soon as they are born: and this is
generally suppos'd to be the truest Account.
Time will discover the Truth of this Matter.
'Tis certain they have Treasures in their
Country, enough to enrich the whole World:

<P>FOUR Leagues below this Strait, on the
South-side, is the Mouth of the great
and noble River of the <HI>Tapajotos,</HI> which bor∣rows
its Name from that of the Inhabitants
of the Province which it waters. This Coun∣try

of it is very good, and abounds with all sorts

that dwell near 'em, because they inve∣nom
their Arrows with so subtile a Poison,
that they kill those they wound, there being
no Remedy found powerful enough to resist
their Venom. This was the only Reason
why the Portuguez themselves were so long
their Neighbours without having any Com∣merce
or Alliance with them, tho they were
very desirous of obtaining their Friendship;
but when they would have obliged 'em to
quit their Country, and to come and inhabit
the Places which the Portuguez had con∣quer'd,
the <HI>Tapajotos</HI> would never give their
Consent to it, because nothing in the World
touches 'em more sensibly, than to talk to

'em of leaving their native Country. Not
but that they received our Men very kindly,
and with a great deal of Joy, when they
landed in their Country: We had large Ex∣perience
of their Kindness when we lodged
at one of their great Towns, which con∣tain'd
above 500 Families, where for a whole
day they were continually coming to visit us,
bringing us Hens, Ducks, Fish, Meal, Fruits,
and all other things we wanted, with so
much Freedom and Confidence in us, that
the Women and Children did not care to go
out of our sight: Nay they frankly told us,
that if the Portuguez would let them alone
to enjoy their own Houses, they should come
if they pleas'd, with all their Hearts, to
dwell amongst 'em; and that they would re∣ceive
'em, and serve 'em as their best Friends

<P>ALL the Civilities of the <HI>Tapajotos</HI> were
not sufficient to touch the Minds of
People that mind nothing but Self-interest,
and the Gratification of their covetous Hu∣mour,
such as those that go to conquer these
Countries, proposing nothing to themselves
<PB N="170" REF="93"/>
in so long and difficult an Enterprize, but to
get a great number of Slaves to sell, or truck
for other Goods; who therefore had scarce
Patience to hear the Proposals of these poor
People, much less so much Justice as to treat
'em with Civility and Reason; but having
got a Notion that these People had abundance
of Slaves to wait on 'em, began to treat 'em
as Rebels, to commit great Outrages upon
'em, and to menace 'em with a cruel War.
All things were in this posture when we ar∣rived
at the Fort of the Portuguez call'd
<HI>Destierro,</HI> that is [<HI>the Fort of Banishment</HI>]
where their Troops were coming together to
put in execution this barbarous Design. I
not being able wholly to hinder it, however
endeavour'd by the best Methods I could
take, at least to suspend the execution of it
for a little time, till I could give the Gover∣nour
of <HI>Para</HI> advice of it. He that was to
command in this Expedition was <HI>Benoise Ma∣ziel,</HI>
the Governour of <HI>Para</HI>'s Son, who was
constituted in the Office of Serjeant Major of
the State. He gave me his Word that he
would not advance to put his Enterprize in
execution till he had received fresh Orders
from his Father. But I had scarce left him
before he embark'd as many Souldiers as he
could in a Brigantine arm'd with Pieces of
Canon, and in other less Vessels, with which
he came suddenly upon 'em to surprize 'em.
<PB N="171" REF="93"/>
These poor People immediately accepted
Peace, with a thousand Testimonies of their
good Affection to the Portuguez; and when
they had submitted their Persons to their
pleasure, <HI>Maziel</HI> commanded 'em to bring
him all the poison'd Arrows they had, which
was what they most fear'd: These poor
Wretches presently obey'd, and they were
no sooner disarm'd but the Portuguez made
'em all come together, and inclos'd 'em like
Sheep in a Fold, securing 'em with a strong
Guard; and immediately let loose a great
many Indians of their own Company, whom
they brought with 'em, who for doing of
Mischief are like so many unchain'd Devils;
and these in a very little time sack'd this
whole Town, so that they spoil'd and broke
every thing in it; they seiz'd all the Daugh∣ters
and Wives of these miserable Creatures,
and committed such abominable Violences
before their Eyes, that one of the Company
that gave me an account of this Action, pro∣tested

<P>THE Inhumanity of the Portuguez did
not stop here; for they having no
other design than that of procuring Slaves,
were not satisfied in having the Masters in
possession: therefore they endeavour'd to
affright these poor Indians, whom they kept
under Guard, with terrible Menaces, and
made 'em tremble at the thoughts of the
new Cruelties they said they would exercise
on 'em, if they would not give 'em Slaves;
and on the other hand promis'd them, that if
they would, they should not only have their
full Liberty, but they would consider 'em as
their best Friends; and besides, would give
'em as many Iron Tools and Cotton Clothes
in exchange for 'em, as should fully satisfy
'em. What could these poor Creatures do
more than abandon themselves to the Discre∣tion
of their Enemies? They saw they were
in their hands, depriv'd of their Arms, their
Houses plunder'd, their Wives and Daugh∣ters
ravish'd. They therefore offer'd to pro∣cure
'em a thousand Slaves, and sent some of
<PB N="173" REF="94"/>
their Company to get 'em together; but these
poor Wretches were fled away to secure
themselves while the Town was pillaging;
therefore they could not possibly get above
two hundred: These they deliver'd to the
Portuguez, and promising to procure all the
rest for which they had engag'd, were set at
liberty. In the Condition these poor Crea∣tures
were, they would have given their ve∣ry
Children for Slaves, to come to a Com∣position
with their Enemies, as they have
frequently done. The Portuguez put all these
Slaves in a Vessel, and sent 'em to <HI>Maragnon</HI>
and <HI>Para.</HI> This I assert as a thing I saw
with my own Eyes: This Prey was very
grateful to the <HI>Portuguez;</HI> and their Success
in this Expedition so encouraged 'em, and
excited their Avarice, that they soon made
preparation to go and seek a greater Booty of
this kind in another Province more remote
upon this great River. 'Tis not to be doubted
but they exercis'd still greater Cruelties, be∣cause
in these Expeditions there go very few
that have any Honour or Conscience, who
might be capable of assisting him that com∣mands,
to restrain the Souldiers Barbarities.
These things must needs enrage all the In∣habitants
of this River against the Name of
the Portuguez. And I doubt not that when
an Attempt shall be made to pacify the Com∣motions,
and allay the Hatred these Violences
<PB N="174" REF="95"/>
have caus'd among those People, it will be
found a matter of that great difficulty that
'twill scarce ever be accomplish'd; whereas
in the State we left these People upon the Ri∣ver
when we pass'd by their Countries, no∣thing
could have been more easy than to have
made a General Peace with them. These are
the Conquests of <HI>Brazil</HI> so much talk'd of,
and this is the Traffick the Souldiers live up∣on:
and let me add, this is the true and just
Cause for which God punishes these miserable
Souldiers to that degree, that they are perpe∣tually
in War and Trouble, and have scarce
Bread to eat. And I believe, if it were not
that God in some sort makes use of 'em to ac∣complish
his Designs upon the Indians, and
that they are continually engag'd in War a∣gainst
the Dutch, and have already obtain'd
several Victories over those<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note,</HI> That this Discovery was made at a time when the Portuguez were continually driving the Dutch from one Garison or another in <HI>Brazil,</HI> of which they had possess'd themselves not long before; and the Conquest the Dutch made of this Country was the occasion of the Establish∣ment of the <HI>West-India</HI> Company in <HI>Holland,</HI> as well for the carrying on of Trade in this part of <HI>America</HI> which the Portuguez possess'd, as for the compleating of the Con∣quest of it. But 'tis now above 30 Years since they have had any thing beyond the Line. On this side of the Line they yet possess <HI>Surinam</HI> on the Continent, and the Island of <HI>Corassol,</HI> or <HI>Curazao;</HI> and they have still a great many strong Places on the Western Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and several Factories in divers places on that Coast.</NOTE> Hereticks; if it
were not, I say, for these things, I believe
<PB N="175" REF="95"/>
our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> would have long since
extirpated such cruel and abominable Con∣querors.
But to return to the <HI>Tapajotos,</HI> and
the famous River upon the Banks of which
they dwell; I say, the bottom of this River is
very good, so that a great English Vessel some
Years ago went a considerable way up it,
with a design to make Plantations in this Pro∣vince,
and to settle the Trade of Tobacco
with the People of the Country, to which end
they offer'd 'em very advantagious Terms:
but the <HI>Tapajotos</HI> would accept of none, but
surpriz'd the English unawares, and kill'd
all they could come at after they had seiz'd
their Arms, which they keep to this day.
Thus they made the rest leave the Country
in more haste than they come to it; for
they escap'd in their Vessel, and by set∣ting
Sail with all speed avoided such ano∣ther
Rencounter, which would have de∣stroy'd
'em all.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the River Curupatuba, and the Account

<P>ABout forty Leagues below the Mouth of
the River of the <HI>Tapajotos</HI> we met
with the River <HI>Curupatuba,</HI> which comes
down on the North-side of the <HI>Amazone,</HI>
and gives its Name to the first Indian Town
that is at Peace with the Portuguez, and un∣der
the Protection of their King. This Ri∣ver
is not very big, but very wealthy, if the
Natives are to be believ'd, who assure us,
that at the end of six days Voyage up the
Stream of it, there is a little Rivulet, in the
Sand and Banks of which there is a great
quantity of Gold found below the place
where it washes the foot of an indifferently
large Mountain called <HI>Yuquaratinci.</HI> The
Indians moreover told us, that near this Ri∣ver
there is another place call'd <HI>Picari,</HI> from
whence they have often taken a sort of Me∣tal
harder than Gold, but very white (with∣out
doubt they mean Silver) with which
they were wont formerly to make Hatchets
<PB N="169" REF="96"/>
and Knives; but finding the Tools made of
this Metal were apt to have their Edg turn'd
when any Stress was put to 'em, they did
not make any account of 'em. They further
gave us an account, That near the Strait I
have spoken of, there are two Hills, one of
which by the Signs they gave of it, is in all
probability a Hill of <HI>Azure;</HI> and it seems the
other, which they call <HI>Penagara,</HI> when the
Sun shines, or when the Nights are clear and
bright, glitters and sparkles as if it were full
of rich Diamonds. They assur'd us that
horrible Noises were heard in it from time to
time, which is a certain sign that this Moun∣tain
contains Stones of a great Value in its
Entrails.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the River Ginipape, which has Treasures

Soil for Tobacco, and Sugar-Canes.</HEAD>
<P>THE River <HI>Ginipape</HI> which comes down
on the North-side, and enters into the
<HI>Amazone</HI> 60 Leagues below the Villages of
<HI>Curupatuba,</HI> promises as great Treasures and
as rich Mountains as those of which we have
<PB N="170" REF="97"/>
just now spoken. The Indians assure us of
so much Gold along the Banks of it, that if it
be according to their Relation, this one River
possesses more Riches than are in all <HI>Peru.</HI>
The Lands this River waters are of the Go∣vernment
of <HI>Maragnon,</HI> which is in the hands
of <HI>Benedito Maziel:</HI> And without counting
the great Extent of this Country, which a∣lone
is larger than all <HI>Spain</HI> join'd together,
and that it contains several Mines of which
we have very certain knowledg; I shall only
say that generally the Ground of it is of
the best kind for the Production of all sorts
of Grain and Fruit, and what may turn to the
Account of those that inhabit it, that is to be
found in all the vast Extent of the great Ri∣ver
of <HI>Amazons.</HI> This Country is situate on
the North-side, and comprehends several
great Provinces of Savages. But that which is
yet more considerable is, that in this Country
are those Fields so famous for the Production
of prodigious quantities of <HI>Tucui.</HI> Our Ene∣mies
the Dutch have given a Reputation to
these Lands, and have often found by Ex∣perience,
not only the Goodness and Fertility
of the Soil, but also the vast Profits with
which this alone is capable of inriching its
Inhabitants: Therefore they could never
forget this sweet place, but have made Plan∣tations
there several times, tho to their Da∣mage
<PB N="171" REF="97"/>
and Sorrow, because they have been
always forc'd out of 'em by the Portuguez.
Therefore 'tis worth Consideration▪ that this
Place is very good to make great Plantations
of Tobacco, and that there's no part of all
the Countries that have been discover'd that
is better for the planting of Canes, and for
making of Sugar. This Soil returns all the
Cultivation that is bestow'd upon it with
Usury, and produces all sorts of Provision
in extraordinary plenty: There are very fine
pieces of Pasture-ground, which in their vast
Extent would feed an infinite number of all
sorts of Cattle. Six Leagues above the
place where this River empties it self into
the <HI>Amazone,</HI> the Portuguez had a Fort
which they call'd <HI>Del Dostierro,</HI> that is
[<HI>The Fort of Banishment</HI>] kept only by
thirty Souldiers, and some pieces of Artille∣ry,
which was of more use to keep the
Indians that are reduc'd under the Power of
the Portuguez, in Fear and Subjection, and
to maintain the Authority of the Governor,
than to secure the River and obstruct the
Passage of an Enemy. This Fort has been
since demolish'd by <HI>Benedito Maziel</HI> with the
Consent of the Governor of <HI>Curupa,</HI> which
is thirty Leagues lower down the River:
But it is to be remark'd, that it was situate
in a place of some Consideration, seeing

their Enemies Vessels were oblig'd to pay

in this Country of being very rich,

of which, by refining, he got a quantity of
Gold. 'Tis said he inrich'd himself with

carried away, for fear they should become
his Enemies, when they came to know what
Riches were in their Sands, and so should
take up Arms against him to hinder him from

<P>THE Great Fort of <HI>Para</HI> is built
Thirty Leagues below <HI>Com∣muta,</HI>
it belongs to the <HI>Portugeze,</HI> and
is under the command of a Governor,
who has the oversight of all other Offi∣cers

he has for his Garrison or∣dinarily
Three Companies of Foot, un∣der
the Command of as many Captains,
who are oblig'd to be always ready at
hand for the preservation and defence
of this Fort; but the Officers as well as
the Governor of the Place, are under
the Jurisdiction of the Governor of <HI>Ma∣ragnon,</HI>
and are absolutely to obey his
Orders. The Government of <HI>Maragnon</HI> is
at above 130 Leagues distance from <HI>Pa∣ra</HI>
down along the River, and then up
towards <HI>Brezil,</HI> which occasions great
inconveniencies in the Conduct of Af∣fairs
in relation to the Government of
<HI>Para.</HI> And if we should ever be so hap∣py
<PB N="178" REF="101"/>
as to plant this River with our Peo∣ple,
it will be necessary to make the Go∣vernor

the place where the Fort of <HI>Para</HI> is now

Judgment; but if this Discovery be
further Improv'd and Advanc'd; it will
be an easie matter to change it; and I
don't find any place more proper for
it than the Island <HI>du Soleil</HI> which is
Fourteen Leagues below the Mouth of
the River: This is doubtless the place
to be absolutely fix'd on, not only be∣cause
it affords abundance of Advanta∣ges
for the Accomodation of Life, the
Ground being extraordinarily Fertile,
and capable of maintaining as many Peo∣ple
as one can desire to settle there; but
also for the convenient harbouring of
Vessels: 'Tis a great Harbour shelter'd

Ships may ride with great Safety, and
when they have a mind to Sail, they
need only wait for the full of the Moon,
at which time the Sea is higher than or∣dinary,
and they may pass over all the
Sands, which renders the entrance of

this River difficult; which is none of
the least Conveniencies. This Island is
above Ten Leagues in Compass; there is
very good Water in it, and abundance
of both Sea and River-Fish, there is an

an Occasion of Signalizing himself▪
to the Rich an Improvement of their
Wealth; to Gentlemen Honorable Em∣ployments;
to Noblemen Large Provin∣ces;
and to Kings themselves Empires,

new Conquests, and ought to be most
heartily concern'd in 'em, are such as
with the greatest Affection, seek the Ad∣vancement
of the Glory of God, and are
Zealously bent to design the Salvation of

of Idolatrous and Heathenish <HI>Indians,</HI>
who want the Help and Light the Faith∣ful
Ministers of the Gospel should fur∣nish
them withal, to dispel the shadows
of Sin and Death, with which those
poor Wretches have been so long be∣nighted.
And let none Excuse them∣selves
from an Attempt of this kind:
Here's Work enough to employ every
one of us, and how great a Number soe∣ver

<PB N="182" REF="103"/>
to it, there will still be more wanting for
so great a Harvest. This New Vine-yard
will still want more hands to Cultivate
and Dress it, how able and how fervent
soever they should prove, who shall be
engag'd in this Service, But it is rather
to be wish'd than expected, that we shall
ever see this New World Subjected to

Holy an Enterprize as the Conquest of

for the Maintenance and Subsistence

and others by their care to provide and
convey Clergymen into those Countries:
And all of 'em have reason to esteem it
a great happiness for them that in the Age

<HEAD>A Relation of Mons. Acarete
du Biscay's Voyage up the
River de la Plata, and
from thence by Land to Pe∣ru,
and his Observations in
it.</HEAD>
<P>THE Inclination I always had to
Travelling, made me leave my
Father's House very young, but
I can truly aver, that I was not so much
prompted to it out of pure Curiosity to
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Forreign Countries, as out of hope
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquire Knowledge and improve my
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dgment, which for the future might
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> helpful to me, not only in my private
concerns, but likewise render me more
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>viceable to my King and Country,
which I declare was the chief aim of my
Voyages. I went first into <HI>Spain,</HI> where
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tarried long enough to learn their
language, particularly at <HI>Cadiz.</HI> The
<PB N="2" REF="110"/>
fancy took me to go to the <HI>West-Indies</HI>
possess'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for I often
heard them talk of the Beauty and Fer∣tility
of the Country, and the great
Riches they draw from thence, but then
I was at a loss how to bring it about,
because 'tis very difficult for a Stranger,
to get into those Parts; but there hap∣pen'd
a conjuncture which favour'd my
Design, and gave me an opportunity to
proceed in it, in the manner follow∣ing.</P>
<P>In the Year 1654, <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> at
that time Protector of the Common∣wealth
of <HI>England,</HI> sent Admiral <HI>Blake</HI>
with a Squadron of Men of War to∣wards
the Coasts of <HI>Algarve</HI> and <HI>Anda∣lousia,</HI>
to wait for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gal∣lions
which come yearly from the <HI>Indies.</HI>
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> being advertis'd of it, re∣solv'd
to equip a Fleet with all expedi∣tion
to oppose the <HI>English</HI> and frustrate
their design: To this end they set out
28 Men of War and 6 Fireships, under
the Command of <HI>Don Paul de Contreras,</HI>
whose Vice-Admiral was the <HI>Amirante
Castana,</HI> on board whom was I. The
Two Fleets came up with each other,
near <HI>Cape St. Vincent,</HI> where they staid
many Days; but the <HI>English</HI> perceiving
<PB N="3" REF="110"/>
they were like to make nothing on't, re∣tir'd
towards <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
stood into <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where all the Gallions
safely arriv'd in the beginning of the
Year 1655, except the Vice-Admiral,
which was lost in the Channel of <HI>Bahama</HI>
upon the Coasts of <HI>Florida.</HI> Sometime af∣ter
this, the <HI>English</HI> having declar'd War
against the <HI>Spaniards</HI> more openly, by
taking <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the Navigation to the
<HI>West-Indies</HI> was a long time interrupted,
by their Cruisers hovering about <HI>Cadiz▪</HI>
and <HI>San Lucar,</HI> where they intercepted
some Ships coming from the <HI>Indies</HI> rich∣ly
laden, took one of the biggest, burnt
Two others, and put the rest to flight,
and afterwards went to the <HI>Canaries,</HI>
where they burnt most of the Flota that
were arriv'd there from <HI>New Spain,</HI> and
waited orders from <HI>Madrid,</HI> what course
to take to escape falling into the hands of
the <HI>English.</HI> While these things were do∣ing,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> who sought to make their
advantage of the Troubles that the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
were embroil'd in, sent several
Ships to the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> laden
with Goods and <HI>Negroes,</HI> which they
took in at <HI>Angola</HI> and <HI>Congo:</HI> These
Ships being arriv'd in that River, and
come up to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> the Inhabi∣tants
<PB N="4" REF="111"/>
of the place who had a long time
been depriv'd of the Supplies which
they had us'd to receive by the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Gallions (who were hinder'd by the
<HI>English</HI> from making their constant Voy∣ages)
and were besides in want of <HI>Ne∣groes</HI>
and other things, wrought so far
upon the Governor, that for a Present
which they oblig'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to give
him, and satisfying the Customs due to
the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> they were permitted
to Land and Trade there.</P>
<P>Mean time the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ministers (ap∣prehending
lest the Interruption of the
Commerce, and the scarcity of <HI>European</HI>
Commodities in those Parts, might con∣strain
the Inhabitants to Traffick with
Strangers (which 'tis their Interest to
prevent as much as they can) thought
fit to grant Licences to several of their
private Subjects to Trade to the <HI>Indies</HI> at
their own proper risque. A certain
Cavalier took one of them, and fitted
out a Ship at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where I abode at
that time; I resolv'd to go in her, and
that the more willingly, because I had
formerly had some dealings with him.
He very friendly consented to let me go
under his Name for his Nephew, that I
might conceal my being a Forreigner,
<PB N="5" REF="111"/>
which if known would have stopt my
Voyage, because in <HI>Spain</HI> they allow
none but Native <HI>Spaniards</HI> to go in their
Ships to the <HI>Indies.</HI> We set Sail about
the latter end of <HI>December</HI> 1657, in a
Ship of 450 Tuns, and in 105 Days
reach'd the Mouth of the River <HI>de la
Plata,</HI> where we met a <HI>French</HI> Frigat,
Captain <HI>Foran</HI> Commander, and fought
her some time, we got clear of her, and
continued our Course till we came be∣fore
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> where we found 22
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, and among them 2 <HI>English,</HI>
Laden homewards with Bulls-hides,
Plate, and <HI>Spanish</HI>-wool, which they
had receiv'd in exchange for their Com∣modities;
a few days after 3 <HI>Dutch</HI>
Ships going out of the Road encounter'd
Captain <HI>Foran</HI> and another Frigat, nam'd
the <HI>Mareschale,</HI> Commanded by the Che∣valier
<HI>de Fontenay;</HI> after a tough dis∣pute
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> boarded and took
the <HI>Mareschale,</HI> put all her Men to
the Sword, and the Chevalier among the
rest.</P>
<P>This accident alarum'd those of <HI>Beue∣nos
Ayres,</HI> and made them put themselves
upon their guard, imagining there was a
<HI>French</HI> Squadron come into the River to
make an attempt upon their Country.
<PB N="6" REF="112"/>
Whereupon they resolv'd to send for
aid to Count <HI>Albaeliste,</HI> Viceroy over all
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Acquisitions in <HI>America,</HI> and
Resident at <HI>Lima</HI> in <HI>Peru;</HI> who caus'd
to be Levy'd with much difficulty and
some force but 100 Men, which were
not sent to them till 8 or 9 Months af∣ter,
under the Command of <HI>Don Sebasti∣an
Comacho.</HI></P>
<P>But before I proceed further, 'tis fit I
deliver my Observations concerning the
River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> and the Countries
through which it runs. In those Parts
'tis call'd the <HI>Paraguay,</HI> but more vulgar∣ly
the Great <HI>Parana;</HI> probably, because
the River of <HI>Parana</HI> falls into it above
the Town <HI>de las Corrientes.</HI> 'Its Mouth
(which lies in the 35th. Degree of <HI>Sou∣thern
Latitude,</HI> on that side the <HI>Equinocti∣al
Line</HI>) is between <HI>Cape de Castillos</HI> and
<HI>Cape de Sant Antonio,</HI> about 80 Leagues
distant from each, Tho' it be deep e∣nough
every where, yet the commonest
Road into it, and most us'd by Sailors
is on the North-side, from <HI>Castillos</HI> to
<HI>Montvidio,</HI> which is half-way to <HI>Buenos
Ayres,</HI> and notwithstanding there is a
Channel on the same North-side from
<HI>Montvidio</HI> to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> the shallow∣est
place in which is Three Fathom deep,
<PB N="7" REF="112"/>
yet for more security they cross over a∣gainst
<HI>Monvidio</HI> into the South Channel,
because 'tis broader and has Three Fa∣thom
and a half Water at least where
'tis shallowest; all the bottom is muddy
till within 2 Leagues of <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI>
where lyes a sand Bank, there they take
in Pilots to Steer them to a place call'd
the <HI>Posso</HI> just before the Town, distant
a Cannon shot from Shore, wherein no
Vessels may enter but such as have a Li∣cence
from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> those that
have no such permission are oblig'd to
Anchor a League Lower. The River is
full of Fish, but of them there are hard∣ly
more than Seven or Eight sorts good
to eat, there are abundance of those
Whales call'd <HI>Gibars,</HI> and Sea-dogs who
commonly bring forth their young a∣shore,
and whose Skin is fit for several
uses. I was told that about 5 or 6 Years be∣fore
I came there, the River was almost
dry'd up for some days, no Water be∣ing
left but only in the middle Channel,
and there so little, that they forded it
on Horseback, as one may do most of
the Rivers that fall into that <HI>de la Plata,</HI>
in which there are likewise a great ma∣ny
<HI>Otters,</HI> with whose Skins the Savages
Cloath themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="113"/>
The Country on the North-side of
the River <HI>de la Plata</HI> is of great extent,
Inhabited by none but Savages, call'd
<HI>Charuas;</HI> most of the little Islands that
lie all along the River, and the Shore
sides are cover'd with Woods full of
Wild Boars. From <HI>Cape de Castillos</HI> up
to <HI>Rio Negro,</HI> as well as from the same
<HI>Cape</HI> to <HI>San Paulo</HI> bordering upon <HI>Bra∣sil;</HI>
the Coasts are uninhabited, tho' the
Country, especially along the River
seems to be very good, having little Ri∣vulets
running down from the Hills thro'
the Plains. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> settled first
there, but afterwards remov'd to <HI>Buenos
Ayres,</HI> because 'twas troublesom to cross
over the great <HI>Parana</HI> to go to <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>I went ashore frequently beyond <HI>Rio
Negro,</HI> but never farther than Three
quarters of a League into the Land,
there are but few Savages to be seen, and
they have their Habitations a good way
up in the Country; those I met with
were well made, with long Hair and
very little Beard; they wear nothing but
a great Skin, made of little ones patch'd
together, that hangs down to their heels,
and a piece of Leather under their Feet,
ty'd with Straps about their Ankles. For
Ornament they bind a Fillet of some
<PB N="9" REF="113"/>
Stuff about their Heads, which comes o∣ver
the Fore-head, and keeps the Hair
back behind. The Women have no o∣ther
Garment but these Skins, which
they gird about their Wastes, and co∣ver
their heads with a sort of little Hats
made of Rushes of divers Colours.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rio Negro</HI> to <HI>Las Corrientes</HI> and
the River of <HI>Parana,</HI> the Country is
well stockt with Bulls and Cows, there
are likewise a great many Stags, whose
Skins they sell for right Buff. The Sa∣vages
about <HI>Rio Negro</HI> are the only Peo∣ple
from the Sea thither, that keep Cor∣respondence
with those of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI>
and the <HI>Casiques,</HI> and <HI>Couracas</HI> their Lea∣ders
do Hommage to the Governor of
that Place, from whence they are but
about 20 Leagues distant. One of the
chief <HI>Spanish</HI> Towns on that side is <HI>Las
Siete Corrientes,</HI> Situate near the place
where the Two Rivers <HI>Paraguay</HI> and <HI>Pa∣rana</HI>
meet. Upon the <HI>Parana</HI> stand
Three or Four Villages pretty far from
each other, and thinly Peopled, tho'
the Country be very proper for Vine-yards,
and has enough planted already
to supply the Neighbouring Parts with
Wine. The Inhabitants are under the
Jurisdiction of a Governour resident at
<PB N="10" REF="114"/>
<HI>Assomption,</HI> which is the most important
Place the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have in that Coun∣try,
and stands higher up the River <HI>Pa∣raguay</HI>
on the North-side; 'tis the Metra∣politan
City, a Bishop's Seat, has seve∣ral
very neat Churches and Convents,
and is well crowded with Inhabitants,
because a great many Idle People, and
such as have run out their Fortunes and
can live no longer in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Peru,</HI>
flock thither as to their last refuge. The
Land abounds in Corn, Millet, Sugar,
Tobacco, Honey, Cattle, Oaks fit for
Shipping, Pine-Trees for Masts, and
particularly in that Herb, call'd, the
<HI>Herb of Paraguay,</HI> which they drive a
great Trade in all over the <HI>West-Indies;</HI>
and this obliges the Merchants of <HI>Chili</HI>
and <HI>Peru,</HI> to hold a Correspondence
with those of <HI>Paraguay;</HI> because, with∣out
that Herb (with which they make a
refreshing Liquor with Water and Su∣gar,
to be drank lukewarm) the Inhabi∣tants
of <HI>Peru,</HI> Savages and others, espe∣cially
those that work in the Mines, could
not subsist, for the Soil of the Country
being full of Mineral Veins, the Vapours
that rise out of the Ground suffocate
them, and nothing but that Liquor can
recover them again, which revives and
<PB N="11" REF="114"/>
restores them to their former Vi∣gour.</P>
<P>In this City of <HI>Assomption,</HI> the Native
<HI>Indians,</HI> as well as <HI>Spaniards</HI> are very
courteous and obliging to Strangers.
They indulge themselves in a great deal
of liberty, even with respect to Women,
insomuch that being often necessitated
to Sleep in the open Air (because of the
excessive Heat) they spread their Quilts
in the Streets, and lie there all Night
Men and Women together: Nor is any
Body scandaliz'd at it. Having plenty of
all things good to eat and drink, they
give themselves up to Ease and Idleness,
and don't much trouble themselves with
Trading abroad, nor heaping up Money,
which upon that account is very scarce
among 'em, contenting themselves with
trucking the Commodities of their own
Product, for others more necessary and
useful to them.</P>
<P>Further up in the Country, that is to
say, towards the Head of the River <HI>Ʋru∣gay,</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Paraguay,</HI> are ma∣ny
Settlements of Colonies, transplant∣ed
thither by the <HI>Jesuits Missionaries,</HI>
that prevail'd upon the Savages in those
Parts, who are naturally tractable, to
quit their Woods and Mountains, and
<PB N="12" REF="115"/>
come and dwell together in Villages in
a Civil Community, where they in∣structed
them in the Christian Religion,
taught them Mechanicks, to play upon
Musical Instruments, and several other
Arts covenient to Human Life. <HI>Thus
the Missionaries who came upon a Religi∣ous
Motive, are largely recompenc'd by
the Temporal Advantages which they reap
here.</HI> The report that there were Golden
Mines in this Country, could not be
kept so close, but that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had
some inkling of it, and among others,
<HI>Don Hiacinto de Laris</HI> Governor of <HI>Bue∣nes
Ayres,</HI> who about the Year 1653, had
orders from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to go
and visit these Settlements, and examine
into their Wealth. At first coming he
was well receiv'd, but perceiving that
he began to inspect their Riches, and
search for Gold, The Savages who are
shy of working in the Mines, took up
Arms, and forc'd him and his Followers
Fifty in Number to depart out of their
Country. The Governor who succeeded
him, inform'd himself more particularly
of this matter, and to make the best use
of his Intelligence, inter'd into a strict
Alliance with the <HI>Jesuits</HI> of his own
Government, who hold a Correspon∣dence
<PB N="13" REF="115"/>
with the rest of their Fraternity;
and having got a considerable Sum from
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for leave to Trade at
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> he engag'd the <HI>Jesuits</HI> to
furnish him 100000 Crowns in Gold for
the value in Silver, for lightness of Car∣riage.
But this same Governor being
arrested by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Order,
for permitting the <HI>Dutch</HI> to Trade at
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> his Gold was seiz'd and
confiscated, which upon trial prov'd to
be much finer than that of <HI>Peru,</HI> and by
this and other Circumstances, they dis∣cover'd,
that it came from the Mines
found out by the <HI>Jesuits</HI> in these parts.</P>
<P>On the South-side of the River <HI>de la
Plata,</HI> from <HI>Cape Sant Antonio,</HI> to within
30 Leagues of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> 'tis dange∣rous
Sailing, because of the Banks that
lie in the way; wherefore they always
go on the North-side, as I said before,
till they come up so far, then they cross
over to the South-side which is very safe;
especially when the Wind blows against
the Stream of the River and swells it;
for when a Westerly Wind blows from
Land, the Water falls; however when
the Water is at the lowest, 'tis Three
Fathom and a half deep, both in the
North and South Channels. When we
<PB N="14" REF="116"/>
enter'd into the South-Channel, we came
in sight of those Vast Plains extending to
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and thence as far as the
River <HI>Salladillo,</HI> 60 Leagues short of
<HI>Cordoua,</HI> which are so cover'd with all
sorts of Cattle, that notwithstanding
multitudes of them are daily destroy'd
for their Skins, there's no Sign of their
diminution.</P>
<P>As soon as we arriv'd at the <HI>Cape</HI> of
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> we gave notice of it to
the Governor, who understanding that
we had the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Licence for
coming thither, (without which he
could not have permitted us entrance in∣to
the place, unless he would have broke
his Orders) he sent the Kings Officers
on board to visit our Ship, according to
custom, which done, we landed our
Goods, and laid them up in a Ware∣house
hired for the time of our stay.
They consisted chiefly in Linnen Cloath,
particularly that made at <HI>Rouen,</HI> which
goes off very well in those Parts, as al∣so
in Silks, Ribans, Thread, Needles,
Swords, Horse-shoes, and other Iron-work,
Working-tools of all sorts, Drugs,
Spices, Silk and Wollen-Stockings,
Woollen-Cloath, Serges, and other
Woollen-Stuffs, and generally in every
<PB N="15" REF="116"/>
thing fit for Cloathing: which as we
were inform'd were proper commodities
for those Parts. Now the Custom is,
that as soon as a Licens'd Ship (that is
to say which has the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s
Permission) comes to <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> The
Governor of the Place, or Captain of
the Ship dispatches a Messenger to <HI>Peru,</HI>
with the Letters from <HI>Spain,</HI> if he has
any; or else to acquaint the Merchants
with his Arrival, whereupon some of
them immediately set out to <HI>Buenos Ay∣res,</HI>
or else send Commissions to their
Correspondents, to buy up what Wares
they think convenient. 'Twas my for∣tune
to be sent upon both these Errands,
for among a great many Letters that
we brought with us, was a large pac∣quet
from his Catholick Majesty for
<HI>Peru,</HI> enclos'd in a Leaden Box, as all the
Dispatches from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court to the
<HI>Indies</HI> commonly are; to the end, that if
the Ship that carries them should be in
eminent peril of falling into an Ene∣mies
Hands, they might be flung over
board and sunk. This Pacquet was
entrusted to my care, wherein were
many Letters to the Vice-Roy of <HI>Pe∣ru,</HI>
and other Prime Officers in those
Parts, signifying the Birth of the Prince
<PB N="16" REF="117"/>
of <HI>Spain:</HI> and I carry'd likewise an
Inventory attested by the Kings Officers
at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> of the greatest part of
our Lading, to be shewn to the Mer∣chants
of <HI>Potosi;</HI> they rely'd upon the
conditions of the Goods as specified in
the Inventory, and so bargain'd for what
they lik'd, but their effects did not come
to 'em till Seven or Eight Months af∣ter.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of Buenos Ayres.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I say any thing of my Journy
to <HI>Peru,</HI> I will set down what I ob∣serv'd
remarkable at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> whilst
I tarry'd there. The Air is pretty tem∣perate,
much as 'tis in <HI>Andalousia,</HI> but
not quite so warm, the Rains fall almost
as often in Summer as Winter; and the
Rain in sultry weather usually breeds
divers kinds of Toads, which are very
common in this Country, but are not
venemous. The Town stands upon a
rising Ground on the side of the River
<HI>de la Plata,</HI> a Musquet shot from the
Channel, in an Angle of Land made
<PB N="17" REF="117"/>
by a little Rivulet, call'd <HI>Riochuelo,</HI>
which falls into the River a quarter of
a League from the Town; it contains
400 Houses, has no enclosure, neither
Wall nor Ditch, and nothing to defend
it but a little Fort of Earth surrounded
with a Ditch, which commands the Ri∣ver,
and has Ten Iron Guns, the biggest
of which is a Twelve Pounder; there
the Governor resides who has but 150
Men in Garrison, which are form'd into
Three Companies Commanded by Three
Captains, whom he appoints at will, and
indeed he changes them so often, that
there is hardly a Wealthy Citizen but has
been a Captain; these Companies are not
always full, because the Souldiers are
drawn by the cheapness of Living in
those Parts to desert frequently, not∣withstanding
they endeavour to keep
them in the Service by a large pay, which
is <HI>per diem</HI> Four Reals, worth 1 <HI>s. 6 d.
English,</HI> and a Loaf of 3 <HI>d. ob.</HI> which
is as much as one Man can eat. But the
Governor keeps 1200 tame Horses in a
Plain thereabouts for his ordinary Ser∣vice,
and in case of necessity to mount
the Inhabitants of the Place, and form
a small Body of Cavalry. Besides this
Fort, there is a little Bastion at the
<PB N="18" REF="118"/>
Mouth of the Rivulet wherein they
keep Guard, there are but Two Iron-Guns
mounted upon it, each carrying a
Three Pound Ball; this commands the
place where the Barks come ashore to de∣liver
or take in goods, which are liable
to be visited by the Officers of the Ba∣stion
when they lade and unlade. The
Houses of the Town are built of Earth,
because there is but little Stone in all
those Parts up as far as <HI>Peru;</HI> they are
thatch'd with Canes and Straw, have
no Stories, all the Rooms are of
a Floor, and are very Spacious; they
have great Court-yards, and behind
their Houses large Gardens full of
Orange-trees, Lemon-trees, Fig-trees,
Apple-trees, Pear-trees, and other Fruit-trees,
with store of Herbs, Cabbages,
Onions, Garlick, Lettice, Peas, Beans,
and especially their Melons are excellent,
the Soil being very fat and good; they
live very commodiously, and except
Wine, which is something dear; they
have plenty of all sorts of Victuals, as
Beef, Veal, Mutton, Venison, Hares,
Coneys, Pullets, Ducks, Wild-geese,
Partridges, Pidgeons, Turtles, and all
kind of Wild-fowl; and so cheap, that
one may buy Partridges for a Penny a
<PB N="19" REF="118"/>
piece, and the rest proportionably.
There are likewise abundance of Ostriches
who herd in Flocks like Cattle, and tho'
they are good Meat, yet none but the
Savages eat of them. They make Um∣brellas
of their Feathers, which are very
commodious in the Sun; their Eggs are
good, and every body eats of 'em, tho'
they say they are of hard Digestion. I
saw one thing of these Creatures very
remarkable, and that is, while the Hen
sits upon the Eggs, they have the Instinct
or Foresight to provide for their Young;
so five or six days before they come out
of the Shell, they set an Egg in each of
the four Corners of the place where they
sit, these Eggs they break, and when they
rot, Worms and Maggots breed in 'em
in prodigious numbers, which serve to
nourish the Young Ostriches from the
time they are hatch'd till they are able to
go farther for their sustenance. The
Houses of the better sort of Inhabitants
are adorn'd with Hangings, Pictures,
and other Ornaments and decent Movea∣bles,
and all that are tollerably well to
pass are serv'd in Plate, and have a
great many Servants, <HI>Blacks, Moulatos,
Mestices, Indians, Cabres,</HI> or <HI>Sambos,</HI>
who are all Slaves. The <HI>Negroes</HI> come
<PB N="20" REF="119"/>
from <HI>Guinea;</HI> the <HI>Moulatos</HI> are begotten
by a <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon a <HI>Black;</HI> the <HI>Mesti∣ces</HI>
are born of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> and an <HI>Indian,</HI>
and the <HI>Sambos</HI> of an <HI>Indian</HI> Man and a
<HI>Mestice,</HI> all distinguishable by their Co∣lour
and Hair. They employ these
Slaves in their Houses, or to cultivate
their Grounds, for they have large Farms
stock'd with Grain in abundance, as
Wheat, Barley and Millet, or to look
after their Horses and Mules, who feed
upon nothing but Grass all the Year
round, or to kill Wild-Bulls, or in fine
to do any kind of Service. All the Wealth
of these Inhabitants consists in Cattle,
wich multiply so prodigiously in this
Province, that the Plains are quite co∣ver'd
with 'em, particularly with Bulls,
Cows, Sheep, Horses, Mares, Mules, As∣ses,
Swine, Deer, and others, insomuch
that were it not for a vast number of
Dogs, who devour the Calves and other
young Beasts, they would over-run the
Country, they make so great profit of
the Skins and Hides of these Annimals,
that a single Instance will be sufficient to
shew how far it might be improv'd by
good hands: The 22 <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that
we found at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> were each of
them laden with 13 or 14000 Bull-hides
<PB N="21" REF="119"/>
at least, which amount to above 300000
<HI>Livers,</HI> or 33500 <HI>l. Sterling,</HI> bought by
the <HI>Dutch</HI> at Seven or Eight <HI>Reals</HI> a
piece, that is under an <HI>English</HI> Crown, and
sold again in <HI>Europe</HI> for Twenty-five
Shillings <HI>English</HI> at least. When I express'd
my astonishment at the sight of such
an infinite number of Cattle, they told
me of a Stratagem sometimes made use
of, when they apprehend a descent from
any Enemies, that is matter of greater
wonder, and 'tis this; they drive such
a Herd of Bulls, Cows, Horses and other
Animals to the Shore-side, that 'tis utter∣ly
impossible for any number of Men,
even tho' they should not dread the fu∣ry
of those Wild Creatures, to make
their way through so great a drove of
Beasts. The First Inhabitants of this
place, put every one their mark upon
those they could catch, and turn'd 'em
into their enclosures, but they multiply'd
so fast, that they were forc'd to let 'em
loose, and now they go and kill them
according as they want 'em, or have oc∣casion
to make up a quantity of Hides
for Sale. At present they mark only
those Horses and Mules which they catch
to tame and breed up for Service. Some
Persons make a great Trade of sending
<PB N="22" REF="120"/>
them to <HI>Peru,</HI> where they yield 50 <HI>Pata∣gons,</HI>
or 11 <HI>l. 13 s. 4 d. Sterling</HI> a pair.
Most of the Dealers in Cattle are very
Rich, but of all the Trading People the
most considerable are they that Traf∣fick
in <HI>European</HI> Commodities. Ma∣ny
of whom are reputed worth 2 or
300000 Crowns, or 67000 <HI>l. Sterling.</HI>
So that a Merchant worth no more than
15 or 20000 Crowns is look'd upon as
a mean Retailer; of these last there are
near 200 Families in the Town, that
make 500 Men bearing Arms, besides
their Slaves who are three times that
Number, but are not to be reckon'd of
any Defence, because they are not al∣low'd
to bear Arms: Thus the <HI>Spaniards,
Portuguese,</HI> and their Sons (of whom
those that are born upon the place are
term'd <HI>Criolos,</HI> to distinguish them from
the Natives of <HI>Spain</HI>) and some <HI>Mestices</HI>
are the Militia, which with the Souldiers
in Garrison, compose a Body of above
600 Men, as I computed them in several
Musters, for they draw out on Horse-back
Three times a Year near the Town
on Festival Days. I observ'd there were
many Old Men among them that did not
carry Fire-arms, but only a Sword by
their side, a Lance in hand, and a Buck∣ler
<PB N="23" REF="120"/>
at their shoulder: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> are also most
of them Marry'd and Matters of Fami∣lies,
and consequently have no great
stomach to Fighting. They love their
Ease and Pleasure, and are entirely de∣voted
to <HI>Venus;</HI> I confess they are in
some measure excusable in this point,
for most of their Women are extreamly
pretty, well shaped, and clear skin'd;
and withal so faithful to their Husbands,
that no Temptations can prevail with
them to loosen the Sacred Knot: But
then if their Husbands transgress, they
are often punish'd with Poison or Dag∣ger.
The Women are more in Number
than the Men. Besides <HI>Spaniards,</HI> there are
a few <HI>French, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Genouese,</HI>
but all go for <HI>Spaniards,</HI> otherwise there
would be no dwelling for them there,
especially those that differ in their Reli∣gion
from the <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> because
the Inquisition is settled there.</P>
<P>The Bishop's Revenue amounts to
3000 <HI>Patagons,</HI> or 700 <HI>l. Sterling per
Annum.</HI> His Diocess takes in this Town
and <HI>Santa Fe,</HI> with the Farms belonging
to both; Eight or Ten Priests Officiate
in the Cathedral, which is built of Earth
as well as the Houses. The <HI>Jesuits</HI> have
a College; the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> the <HI>Recol∣lects,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="121"/>
and the <HI>Religious de la Mercy,</HI> have
each a Convent. There is likewise an
Hospital, but there are so few poor Peo∣ple
in these Parts that 'tis of little use.</P>

<HEAD>Monsieur Acarete du Biscay's Jour∣ney
from Buenos Ayres to Peru.</HEAD>
<P>I Left <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and took the Road
to <HI>Cordoua,</HI> leaving <HI>Santa Fe</HI> on my
right hand, of which place take this ac∣count,
'tis a <HI>Spanish</HI> Settlement dependant
upon <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> the Commander is
no more than a Lieutenant, and does no∣thing
but by order from the Governor
of <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> 'Tis a little place con∣taining
25 Houses, without any Walls,
Fortifications, or Garrison, distant 80
Leagues from <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> Northward,
Situate upon the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> large
Vessels might come up to it, were it not
for a great bank that obstructs the pas∣sage
a little above <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> Ne∣vertheless
'tis a very advantageous Post,
because 'tis the only passage from <HI>Peru,
Chili</HI> and <HI>Tucuman</HI> to <HI>Paraguay,</HI> and in a
manner the Magazine of the Commodi∣ties
<PB N="25" REF="121"/>
drawn from thence, particularly that
Herb already spoken of, which they
cannot be without in those Provinces.
The Soil is as good and Fertile here as
at <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI> and the Town having
nothing remarkably different from what
has been observ'd of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> I
leave it, and proceed upon my Jour∣ney.
'Tis counted 140 Leagues from
<HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> to <HI>Cordoua,</HI> and because
some parts of the Road are uninhabited
for a long way together; I furnished
my self at my departure with what I
was inform'd I should stand in need
of; so I set out having a Savage for my
Guide, with Three Horses and Three
Mules, some to carry my Baggage, and
the rest to change upon the way when
that I rid upon was tired.</P>
<P>From <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> to the River <HI>Lu∣can,</HI>
and even as far as the River <HI>Recife,</HI>
30 Leagues, I pass'd by several Habita∣tions
and Farms cultivated by the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI>
but beyond <HI>Recife</HI> to the River
<HI>Salladillo,</HI> I saw none. Let it be obser∣ved
by the way, that these Rivers as well
as all the rest in the Provinces of <HI>Buenos
Ayres, Paraguay</HI> and <HI>Tucuman,</HI> that fall
into the River <HI>de la Plata</HI> are fordable
on Horse-back; but when the Rains or
<PB N="26" REF="122"/>
any other accident swells them, a Tra∣veller
must either swim over, or else get
upon a bundle in the nature of a raft,
which a Savage hawls over to the other
side. I could not Swim, and so was
forc'd to make use of this expedient
twice or thrice when I could not find a
Ford. The way was this, my <HI>Indian</HI>
kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off,
stuffed it with straw, and ty'd it up in
a great bundle with thongs of the same
Hide, upon which I plac'd my self with
my Baggage; he swam over hawling me
after him by a Cord ty'd to the bundle,
and then he repass'd and swam my Horses
and Mules over to me.</P>
<P>All the Country between the River
<HI>Recife</HI> and <HI>Salladillo,</HI> tho' uninhabited,
abounds in Cattle and all sorts of Fruit-trees,
except Walnut and Chesnut-trees;
there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees,
Three or Four Leagues in compass,
that bear excellent Fruit, which they
not only eat raw, but bake them, or dry
them in the Sun, to keep, as we in <HI>France</HI>
do Prunes: They seldom use any other
than the Wood of this Tree for common
firing at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and thereabouts.
The Savages that dwell in these Parts are
distinguish'd into two sorts, those that
<PB N="27" REF="122"/>
voluntarily submit to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
call'd <HI>Panpistas,</HI> the rest <HI>Serranos,</HI> both
cloathed with Skins, but the last set up∣on
the <HI>Panpistas</HI> as their mortal Enemies
wherever they meet with them. All
Fight on Horse-back, either with Lances
pointed with Iron or Bones sharpen'd,
or else with Bows and Arrows, they
wear Bulls-hides fashion'd like a Doublet
without sleeves, to defend their Bodies.
Their Chiefs that command over them
in War and Peace, are call'd <HI>Couracas.</HI>
When they take any one of their Ene∣mies,
alive or dead, they meet all toge∣ther,
and after they have reproach'd him,
that either he or his Relations were the
death of their Kindred or Friends, they
cut and tear him into pieces, which they
roast a little and eat, making a drinking
Bowl of his Scull. They feed mostly
upon flesh either raw or dress'd, and
particularly Colts flesh, which they like
better than Veal. They catch abundance
of Fish likewise in their Rivers. They
have no settled places of aboad, but
ramble up and down, several Families
together, and live in Tents.</P>
<P>I could not inform my self exactly
what Religion they were of, but I was
told that they look'd upon the Sun and
<PB N="28" REF="123"/>
Moon as Deities, and as I travell'd along,
I saw a Savage upon his knees with his
Face to the Sun, who cry'd out and
made strange gestures with his Hands
and Arms. I learn'd from the Savage that
accompany'd me, that he was one of
those they call'd <HI>Papas,</HI> who in the
Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at
Night towards the Moon, to supplicate
those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious
to them, to give them fair Weather, and
Victory over their Foes.</P>
<P>They make no great Ceremony in
their Marriages; but when a Relation
dies, after they have rubb'd his body
with a certain Earth that consumes all but
the Bones, they preserve them, and carry
as many of them as they can convenient∣ly
about with them in a sort of Chests,
and this they do in token of their af∣fection
to their Kindred; indeed they
are not wanting in good Offices to them
during their Lives, nor in their Sickness
and Death.</P>
<P>Along the River <HI>Salladillo,</HI> I took
notice of a great many Parrats, or Pa∣pagays,
as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call them, and
certain Birds, call'd Guacamayos, which
are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice
as big as a Parrat. The River it self is
<PB N="29" REF="123"/>
full of the Fish, call'd <HI>Dorado,</HI> which is
very good to eat. There is also a Crea∣ture
in it, whether 'tis Meat or Poyson
no body knows, it has Four Feet and a
long Tail like a Lizard.</P>
<P>From <HI>Salladillo</HI> quite to <HI>Cordoua,</HI> you
go along a very fine River, that abounds
with Fish, which is neither wide nor
deep, for it may be forded over. On
the Bank of it you meet with little Plan∣tations
every Three or Four Leagues;
which are like Country Houses inhabi∣ted
by <HI>Spaniards, Portuguese,</HI> and the Na∣tives,
who have all the necessary acco∣modations
of Life they can wish, and
are very Civil and Charitable to Stran∣gers;
their principal Wealth is in Hor∣ses
and Mules, in which they Trade with
the Inhabitants of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cordoua</HI> is a Town Situate in a pleasant
and fruitful Plain upon the side of a
River, bigger and broader than that I
have just spoken of: 'Tis compos'd of
about 400 Houses, Built like those of
<HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> It has neither Ditches,
nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He
that Commands it is Governor of all the
Provinces of <HI>Tucuman;</HI> and tho' it be
the place of his ordinary Residence, yet
he is wont now and then, as he sees oc∣casion,
<PB N="30" REF="124"/>
to go and pass some time at <HI>St.
Jago de l' Estro,</HI> at <HI>St. Miguel de Tucuman,</HI>
(which is the Capital City of the Province)
at <HI>Salta</HI> and at <HI>Xuxui.</HI> In each of these
Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has
under him an <HI>Alcalde</HI> and some Officers
for the Administration of Justice. The
Bishop of <HI>Tucuman</HI> likewise usually re∣sides
at <HI>Cordoua,</HI> where the Cathedral
is the only Parish Church of the whole
Town; but there are divers Convents of
Monks, namely of <HI>Dominicans, Recol∣lects,</HI>
and those of the Order <HI>de la Mer∣cy:</HI>
and one of Nunns. The <HI>Jesuits</HI>
have a College there, and their Chappel
is the finest and richest of all.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and
Silver, which they get by the Trade
they have for Mules, with which they
furnish <HI>Peru</HI> and other Parts; which is
so considerable, that they sell about 28
or 30000 of 'em every Year, which they
breed up in their Farms. They usually
keep 'em till they are about Two Years
old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have
about Six <HI>Patagons</HI> a piece for 'em. The
Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry
'em to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> to <HI>Salta</HI> and <HI>Xuxui,</HI>
where they leave 'em for Three Years,
till they are well grown and become
<PB N="31" REF="124"/>
strong, and afterwards bring 'em to <HI>Pe∣ru,</HI>
where they presently have Vent for
'em, because there as well as in the rest
of the Western part of <HI>America,</HI> the
greatest part of their Carriage is upon
Mules. The People of <HI>Cordoua</HI> also
drive a Trade in Cows, which they have
from the Countrey of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and
carry to <HI>Peru,</HI> where without this way
of Subsistance 'tis certain they would
have much ado to live. This kind of
Traffick makes this Town the most con∣siderable
in the Province of <HI>Tucuman,</HI>
as well for its Riches and Commodities,
as for the Number of its Inhabitants,
which are counted to be at least 5 or
600 Families, besides Slaves who are
three times the number. But the gene∣rality
of 'em of all degrees have no other
Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and
are very indifferent Souldiers, the Air
of the Country, and the Plenty they
enjoy, rendring them Lazy and Cow∣ardly.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cordoua</HI> I took the way of St.
<HI>Jago de l' Estro,</HI> which is 90 Leagues
distant from it. In my Journey I from
time to time, that is Seven or Eight
Leagues, met with single Houses of <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who live very so∣litarily;
<PB N="32" REF="125"/>
they are all Situate upon small
Rivulets, some of 'em at the Corners of
Forrests which are frequently to be met
with in that Country, and are almost
all of <HI>Algarobe</HI>-wood, the Fruit of which
serves to make a Drink that is sweet
and sharpish, and heady as Wine; o∣thers
of them in open Fields, which
are not so well stock'd with Cattle,
as those of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> but however
there are enough of 'em, and indeed
more than needs for the subsistance of the
Inhabitants, who also make a Trade of
Mules, and Cotton, and Cocheneil for
dying, which the Country produces.</P>
<P><HI>St. Jago de l' Estro</HI> is a Town of a∣bout
300 Houses, without Ditches or
Walls, Situate in a flat Country, sur∣rounded
with Forrests of <HI>Algarobe;</HI> it
lies on an indifferently large River, Na∣vigable
for Boats, and pretty well stor'd
with Fish. The Air is very hot, and
sultry, which makes the Inhabitants la∣zy
and effemminate. Their Faces are all
very Tawny; they are mightily given
to their Divertisements, and mind Traf∣fick
very little. There are 300 Men that
can bear Arms, taking in as well the Sa∣vages
as Slaves, and they are all ill
Arm'd, and but very mean Souldiers.
<PB N="33" REF="125"/>
The greatest part of the Women are
handsome enough, but have generally a
kind of swelling in the Throat, which
they call <HI>Coto</HI> in the Language of the
Country, and seems to be much the same
with what we call a Wen. The Coun∣try
is sufficiently stor'd with Wild-Fowl,
Venizon, Wheat, Rye, Barley; and
Fruits, as Figgs, Peaches, Apples, Pears,
Plumbs, Heart-Cherries, Grapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
There are abundance of Tigers, that are
very fierce and ravenous; Lions that
are very gentle; and Guanacos that are
as big as Horses, with very long Necks,
little Heads, and very short Tails, in
the Stomachs of these Creatures the
<HI>Bezoar</HI>-stone is found. There are Four
Churches in this Town, namely the Pa∣rish-Church,
that of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> that of
the <HI>Recollect Friers,</HI> and one more.
Here the Inquisitor of the Province of
<HI>Tucuman</HI> has his residence; he is a Secu∣lar
Priest, and has Commissaries or De∣puties
under him, whom he places in
all the other Towns of the Province.</P>
<P>After I had continued Three Days at
<HI>St. Jago,</HI> I went from thence to <HI>Salta,</HI>
which is 100 Leagues from it, and leav∣ing
<HI>St. Miguel</HI> of <HI>Tucuman</HI> on the left
hand, which is a Town under the Juris∣diction
<PB N="34" REF="126"/>
of <HI>St. Jago,</HI> I took the Road of
<HI>Esseco,</HI> finding in my way some little Vil∣lages
of <HI>Spaniards</HI> here and there, and
very few Savages. The Country is flat,
and consists partly of Fruitful Plains,
and partly of Forrests full of Algarobe
and Palm-trees; which bear Dates some∣what
less than those in the East-Coun∣tries,
as well as many other sorts of Trees
and Plants, amongst others, those that
yield Pitch, and those that produce Co∣cheneil
and Cotton. There are divers
small Lakes, about which there are great
quantities of Salt produc'd, which is us'd
by the People of that Country. I stay'd
one day at <HI>Esseco,</HI> to prepare my self
some Provisions to live upon. It's Situ∣ation
is upon a very handsome broad
River, which yet may be foarded on
Horseback. This Town was formerly as
big and as considerable as <HI>Cordona,</HI> but
is now ruin'd, there being not above 30
Families left in it, for the rest deserted
it, because of the great number of Tigers
that infested 'em, devouring their Chil∣dren,
and sometimes Men when they
could surprize 'em, besides an incredible
number of Venemous Flies, that sting
very smartly, with which the Country
is fill'd for four or five Leagues about
<PB N="35" REF="126"/>
the Town; so that there's no going a∣broad
without being mask'd. This
Country is also sufficiently Fruitful in
Wheat, Barley, Vines, and other Fruit-trees;
and would abound in Cattle if the
Tigers did not devour 'em.</P>
<P>From <HI>Esseco</HI> to <HI>Salta</HI> is 15 Leagues:
And this space of Land, would be like
that I have just now spoken of, but that
it is Gravelly in some places. One may
easily discern <HI>Salta</HI> about 2 Leagues be∣fore
one comes at it; because it stands
in the middle of a fine Plain, which
is fertile in Corn, Grapes, and other
sorts of Fruit, Cattle, and other neces∣saries
of Life: Encompass'd in some pla∣ces
with Hills, and some pretty high
Mountains. The Town is upon the
bank of a Little River, over which there
is a Bridge: It may contain about 400
Houses, and 5 or 6 Churches and Con∣vents,
the Structure of which, is like that
of those I have before describ'd. 'Tis
not encompass'd with any Walls, Forti∣fications
or Ditches; but the Wars the
Inhabitants have had with their Neigh∣bours,
have train'd them in Martial Dis∣cipline,
and render'd 'em more careful
to have Arms in a readiness than former∣ly:
They are about 500 Men, who
<PB N="36" REF="127"/>
all bear Arms, besides Slaves, Moulatos,
and Blacks, who are three times as many.
'Tis a place of great resort, because of
the considerable Trade they have, in
Corn, Meal, Cattle, Wine, Salted Meat,
Tallow, and other Commodities where∣with
they Trade with the Inhabitants of
<HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>Twelve Leagues beyond it lies <HI>Xuxui,</HI>
which is the last Town of <HI>Tucuman</HI> on
the side of <HI>Peru.</HI> There are up and down
on the Road a great many Cottages or
Farms, and more than in any other
place, tho' the Country is not so pleasant
nor so fruitful, being almost nothing
else but Hills and Mountains. This
Town of <HI>Xuxui</HI> contains about 300
Houses: 'Tis not very full of People,
because of the continual Wars the Inha∣bitants
of it, as well as those of <HI>Salta,</HI>
have with the Savages of the Valley of
<HI>Calchaqui,</HI> who are continually harasing
of 'em. The Cause that set these Wars
on Foot is as follows; The Governor
of <HI>Tucuman, Don Alonso de Mercado,</HI>
and <HI>de Villa Corta,</HI> having receiv'd Infor∣mation,
that the House of the last <HI>Incas</HI>
or Kings of <HI>Peru,</HI> which was call'd the
White-house, was in this Valley, and
that there was a great deal of Treasure
<PB N="37" REF="127"/>
there, which the Natives kept as a mark
of their Ancient Grandeur, gave advice
of it to his Catholick Majesty, and
begg'd leave to make a Conquest of it,
and subject it to his Government, as it
had far'd with so many other places
which he obtain'd. To accomplish his
design, he thought meet to employ <HI>Don
Pedro Bohoriers</HI> a Moor, and Native of
<HI>Estramadura,</HI> as being a Person who had
been accustom'd to converse with Savage
People, and was capable of carrying on
Intreagues amongst 'em, and so more fit
than another, to make this design suc∣ceed;
but the business had a quite con∣trary
Event. For this <HI>Bohoriers,</HI> when
he was got among the Savages of this
Valley, and had gain'd their Affections,
instead of acquitting himself of his
Commission, endeavor'd to establish him∣self
in Power amongst 'em, in which he
succeeded so well, that by his Craft and
good address, he brought 'em to choose
and acknowledge him for their King;
after which he declar'd himself against
this <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor, and began a War
with him towards the end of 1638, and
several times routed him and his Forces,
which gave occasion to several of the
<HI>Indian</HI> Natives, that were under the Do∣minion
<PB N="38" REF="128"/>
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to throw of their
Yoke, and joyn with the People of
this Valley, who by these additions have
render'd themselves somewhat formida∣ble.
Hither also the Slaves of <HI>Peru,</HI>
particularly those that serve in the Mines,
fly, when they can find an opportunity
to make their escape: And the safe re∣treat
they find here, draws a great num∣ber
of 'em to this place; insomuch that
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not have half Men
enough to work in the Mines, if they
did not get Negros from <HI>Congo, Angola,</HI>
and other places on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI>
by means of divers <HI>Genoese</HI> that go thi∣ther
to fetch 'em, and sell 'em to them
at a price concerted between 'em.</P>
<P>From <HI>Xuxui</HI> to <HI>Potosi</HI> they count
a 100 Leagues, the way is very trou∣blesome,
and there is but this one Road
to go from <HI>Tucuman</HI> to <HI>Peru.</HI> Two
Leagues from <HI>Xuxui</HI> I began to advance
to the Mountains, between which there's
a little and very narrow Valley, that
reaches as far as <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> which is 20
Leagues beyond, and along it there runs
a small River, which one is oblig'd to
pass and repass very often. Before you
are got 4 Leagues in this Road, you
meet with Vulcanos, or Burning Moun∣tains,
<PB N="39" REF="128"/>
full of Sulphurous matter, which
break out in Flames from time to time,
and sometimes burst open and throw
quantities of Earth into the Valley, which
makes the way so dirty when a Rain
comes soon after it, as it almost always
happens, that sometimes you must be
forc'd to stay Five or Six Months, or till
the Summer comes to dry it to make it
passable. These Vulcanos continue for
2 Leagues upon this Road, and in all
this space, there are no Houses either of
<HI>Spaniards</HI> or Savages, but beyond it all
along as far as <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> there are a
great many little Cottages, inhabited on∣ly
by <HI>Indians,</HI> and depending on some
Towns of theirs, which are govern'd by
their Chiefs, whom they call <HI>Couracas,</HI>
who have a Cacique over them, whose
Orders they obey, and whose residence
is at <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> which is a Town of 200
Houses, built of Earth, and standing in
no good Order. The Land about it is none
of the best, however they sow Wheat
there, and a great quantity of Millet,
which the <HI>Indians</HI> ordinarily use. As
for Cattle, they have very few, and
commonly eat Beef dry'd in the Sun,
which is brought them by those that
Trade with 'em; they have also Goats
<PB N="40" REF="129"/>
and Sheep of their own Product.</P>
<P>The most of these Savages are Catho∣licks,
and live according to the Rules
of the Roman Catholick Religion; they
have a Church at <HI>Omagoaca,</HI> which is
supplied with Priests, who go from time
to time to celebrate Mass there: These
Priests dwell at <HI>Socchoa,</HI> which is the
Plantation of <HI>Don Paulo d' Obaudo,</HI> who
is a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but born in this Country,
and is Lord Proprietor of it, which
contains not only all the Valley of <HI>Oma∣goaca,</HI>
but likewise a great space of Land
beyond, and is a Country of about 60
or 80 Leagues in extent, where there are
a great many <HI>Vigognes</HI> of whose Wool this
Lord makes a very considerable Advan∣tage.
He takes these Creatures with a great
deal of ease by means of his Subjects the
<HI>Indians,</HI> who have no other trouble than
that of making a great Inclosure with
Nets about a Foot and a half high, to
which they tie a great many Feathers
that are blown to and fro by the Wind,
after which the Savages hunt these Crea∣tures,
and drive 'em within the Nets, as
they do Wild-Boars in <HI>France</HI> into the
Toils; when this is done, some come
on Horse-back within the compass of
Ground in which they are inclos'd, and
<PB N="41" REF="129"/>
while the poor Beasts dare not go near
the Nets for fear of the Feathers that
play about 'em, they with certain Bowls
fastened to Cords, knock down and
kill as many of 'em as they please.</P>
<P>From <HI>Omagoaca</HI> to <HI>Mayo,</HI> they count
it 30 Leagues, &amp; there's nothing to be
met with along this way, but a very
few Plantations of Savages, because 'tis
so very Cold here in the Winter, that
'tis hard to be endur'd.</P>
<P>The way from <HI>Mayo</HI> to <HI>Toropalca</HI> is
through very pleasant Plains, there are
Two hundred Houses in the Town, in∣habited
by Catholick Savages, only one
<HI>Portuguese</HI> lives there with his Fami∣ly.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Toropalca,</HI> is the Country of
<HI>Chichas</HI> which is very Mountainous, and
is stor'd with divers Mines of Gold and
Silver, and Work-houses where they
prepare the Metal. 'Tis 25 Leagues in
extent as far as <HI>Potosi,</HI> where I arriv'd
after a Journey of Sixty three Days.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of the City of Potosi,
and the Mines there.</HEAD>
<P>I Was no sooner alighted from my
Horse, at a Merchants House to
whom I had been recommended, but I
was conducted by him to the President
of the Provinces of <HI>Los Charcas,</HI> to
whom the Order I carried from the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> was directed, as the Principal
Director of his Catholick Majesty's Af∣fairs
in this Province, in which <HI>Potosi</HI> is
Situate, which is the place of his Ordi∣nary
Residence, altho' the City <HI>de la
Plata</HI> is the Capital. After I had deli∣ver'd
the Order to him, I was brought
to the Corregidor, to deliver that which
belong'd to him, and afterwards to those
other Officers for whom I brought Or∣ders;
they all receiv'd me very well,
particularly the President, who present∣ed
me with a Chain of Gold for the
good News I had brought him.</P>
<P>But before we go any farther 'tis con∣venient
I should give some description
of the City of <HI>Potosi,</HI> as I have done of
<PB N="43" REF="130"/>
others. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it the Impe∣rial
City, but no body could ever tell
me for what reason; 'tis Situate at the
Foot of a Mountain, call'd <HI>Arazassou,</HI>
and divided in the midst by a River,
which comes from a Lake inclos'd with
Walls, which lies about a quarter of a
League above the City, and is a kind of
reserver to hold the Water that is neces∣sary
for the Work-houses of that part
of the City, which is on this side of the
River, over against the Mountain, is
rais'd upon a little Hill, and is the larg∣est
and most inhabited part; for on
that which is on the side of the Moun∣tain,
there's scarce any thing but Engines
and the Houses of those that Work in
'em. The City has neither Walls, Ditch∣es,
nor Forts for its defence, there are
reckon'd to be 4000 Houses well built
of good Stone, with several Floors, af∣ter
the manner of the Buildings in <HI>Spain.</HI>
The Churches are well made, and all
richly adorn'd with Plate, Tapestry,
and other Ornaments, and above all
those of the Monks and Nunns, of
whom there are several Convents of
different Orders, which are very well
furnish'd. This is not the least populous
City of <HI>Peru,</HI> with <HI>Spaniards, Mestices,
<PB N="44" REF="131"/>
Strangers,</HI> and <HI>Natives</HI> (which last the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Indios</HI>) with <HI>Moulatos</HI> and
<HI>Negroes.</HI> They count there are between
3 and 4000 Natural <HI>Spaniards</HI> bear∣ing
Arms, who have the Reputation of
being very stout Men and good Souldi∣ers.
The number of the <HI>Mestices</HI> is not
much less, nor are they less expert at a
Weapon, but the greatest part of 'em,
are Idle, apt to quarrel and Treache∣rous,
therefore they commonly wear
Three or Four Buff-wast-coats one upon
another, which are proof against the
point of a Sword, to secure themselves
from private stabs. The Strangers there
are but few, there are some <HI>Dutch, Irish,</HI>
and <HI>Genoese;</HI> and some <HI>French,</HI> most of
whom are of <HI>St. Malo, Provence</HI> or <HI>Bay∣onne,</HI>
and pass for People of <HI>Navarre</HI>
and <HI>Biscaye.</HI> As for the <HI>Indians</HI> they are
reckon'd to amount to near 10000 be∣sides
the <HI>Moulatos</HI> and the <HI>Blacks:</HI> but
they are not permitted to wear either
Swords or Fire-Arms, no not their Cou∣racas
and Caciques, tho' they may all
aspire to any degree of Knight-hood,
and to Benefices, to which they are of∣ten
rais'd, for their laudable Actions,
and good Services. They are also for∣bidden
to wear the <HI>Spanish</HI> habit, but
<PB N="45" REF="131"/>
are oblig'd to cloath themselves in a dif∣ferent
manner, in a close-coat without
sleeves, which they wear next their Shirts,
to which their Band and lac'd Cuffs are
fasten'd, their Breeches are wide at bot∣tom
after the <HI>French</HI> fashion; their Legs
and Feet naked. The <HI>Blacks</HI> and <HI>Mou∣latos</HI>
being in the Service of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
are habited after the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Mode, and may bear Arms, and all the
<HI>Indian</HI> Slaves after Ten Years service are
set at liberty, and have the same privi∣leges
with the others. The Government
of this City is very exact, by the Care
which is taken by Twenty four Magi∣strates,
who are constantly observing,
that good orders be kept in it; besides
the Corregidor and President of <HI>Los Char∣cas,</HI>
who directs Officers after the man∣ner
of <HI>Spain.</HI> It is to be observ'd, that
excepting these two Principal Officers,
as well at <HI>Potosi</HI> as every where else in
the <HI>Indies,</HI> all the People, whether
Knights, Gentlemen, Officers or others,
are concern'd in Commerce: of which
some of them make so great an advan∣tage,
that in the City of <HI>Potosi,</HI> there
are some reckon'd to be worth, Two,
some Three, and some Four Millions of
Crowns; and a great many worth Two,
<PB N="46" REF="132"/>
Three, or Four hundred thousand
Crowns. The common People to live
much at their ease, but are all proud and
haughty, and always go very fine, either
in Cloth of Gold and Silver, or in Scar∣let,
or Silk trimmed with a great deal
of Gold and Silver-Lace. The Furni∣ture
of their Houses is very Rich, for
they are generally serv'd in Plate. The
Wives both of Gentlemen and Citi∣zens,
are kept very close, to a degree
beyond what they are in <HI>Spain;</HI> they ne∣ver
go abroad, unless it be to go to
Mass, or to make some Visit, or to some
publick Feast; and that but rarely. The
Women here are generally addicted to
excess in taking Coca: This is a Plant
that comes from the side of <HI>Cusco,</HI> which
when it is made up in Rowls and dry'd
they chew, as some do Tobacco; they
are so heated, and sometimes absolutely
fuddled by it, that they have no com∣mand
of themselves at all: 'Tis likewise
often us'd by the Men, and has the same
effects upon them. They are otherwise
very Temperate in eating and drinking,
tho' they have before dwelt in places
well stor'd with all sort of Provisions,
as Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Venizon, raw
and preserv'd Fruits, Corn and Wine,
<PB N="47" REF="132"/>
which are brought hither from other
parts, and some from a great distance,
which makes these Commodities dear, so
that the meaner sort of People; especially
those that have very little before-hand,
would find it hard enough to live there,
if Money were not very plenty, and
easie to be got by them that are willing
to work.</P>
<P>The best and finest Silver in all the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
is that of the Mines of <HI>Potosi,</HI> the prin∣cipal
of which are found in the Mountain
of <HI>Aranzasse,</HI> where besides the prodigious
quantities of Silver that have been taken
out of Veins, in which the Mettal evi∣dently
appear'd, and which are now
exhausted, there is almost as great quan∣tities
of it found in places where they
had not digg'd before; nay from some
of the Earth which they threw aside for∣merly
when they open'd the Mines, and
made Pits, and Cross-ways in the Moun∣tains,
they have taken Silver, and have
found by this, that the Silver has been
form'd since that time, which shews how
proper the Quality of this Ground is
for the production of that Metal: But
indeed this Earth does not yield so much
as the Mines that are found by Veins a∣mong
the Rocks. There are besides
<PB N="48" REF="133"/>
these another sort of Veins of Earth
which they call <HI>Paillaco,</HI> which are as
hard as a Stone, and of the Colour of
Clay, which were slighted heretofore,
and yet as Experience has since taught,
were not so contemptable as was sup∣pos'd;
since Silver is got out of 'em
with so little Charge, that there is no
inconsiderable profit found in the Work.
Besides the Mines of this Mountain, there
are a great many others about the Coun∣try
at a greater distance, that are pretty
good, amongst others those of <HI>Lippes,</HI>
of <HI>Carangas,</HI> and of <HI>Porco;</HI> but those
of <HI>Ouroures</HI> that have been lately disco∣ver'd
are better.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI> does not cause any
of these Mines to be wrought on his
own account, but leaves 'em to those
Persons that make the Discovery of 'em,
who remain Masters of 'em after the Cor∣regidor
has visited 'em, and declar'd
'em Proprietors, on the accustom'd Con∣ditions
and Privileges. The same Cor∣regidor
describes and marks out the su∣perfices
of the Ground, in which they
are allow'd to open the Mine on the out∣side,
which does not for all that, limit
or restrain their work under-ground;
every Man having liberty to follow the
<PB N="49" REF="133"/>
Vein he has found, let the extent and
depth of it reach never so far, tho' it
should cross that which another has dig∣ged
near it. All that the King reserves
for himself, besides the Duties we shall
hereafter speak of, is to give a general
direction by his Officers, for all the
work of the Mines, and to order the
number of Savages to be employ'd in 'em;
to prevent the disorders that would arise,
if every Proprietor of the Mines should
have liberty to set as many of 'em to
work as he pleas'd; which would fre∣quently
give occasion to those that are
most powerful and Rich, to ingross and
have so great a Number of 'em, that few
or none would remain for others to em∣ploy,
to keep their work going forward:
for this would be contrary to the Kings
Interest, which is to make Provision that
that there be a sufficient number of Slaves
for all the Mines that are open'd. For
this end he obliges all the <HI>Couracas</HI> or
Chiefs of the Savages, to furnish every
one a certain number, which they must
always keep compleat, or else are forc'd
to give twice as much Money as would
have been paid in Wages to those that
are wanting, if they had been present.
Those that are destin'd for the Mines of
<PB N="50" REF="134"/>
<HI>Potosi,</HI> don't amount to above Two
thousand and two or three hundred,
these are brought and put into a great
Enclosure which is at the Foot of the
Mountain, where the Corregidor makes
a distribution of 'em to the Conductors
of the Mines, according to the Number
they want, and after Six days constant
Work, the Conductor brings 'em back
the Saturday following to the same place,
where the Corregidor causes a review to
be made of 'em, to make the owners of
the Mines give 'em the Wages that are
appointed 'em, and to see how many
of 'em are dead, that the <HI>Couracas</HI> may
be oblig'd to supply the number that is
Wanting: for there's no Week passes but
some of 'em die, either by divers acci∣dents
that Occur, as the tumbling down of
great quantities of Earth, and falling of
Stones, or by Sickness and other Casual∣ties.
They are sometimes very much in∣commoded
by Winds that are shut up in
the Mines; the coldness of which joyn'd
to that of some parts of the Earth, chills
'em so excessively, that unless they
chew'd <HI>Coca,</HI> which heats and fuddles
'em, it would be intolerable to 'em. An∣other
great hardship which they suffer is,
that in other places, the Sulphurous and
<PB N="51" REF="134"/>
Mineral Vapours are are so great, that it
strangely drys 'em up, so that it hinders
'em from free respiration; and for this
they have no other remedy, than the
Drink which is made with the Herb of
<HI>Paraguay,</HI> of which they prepare a great
quantity to refresh and moisten 'em,
when they come out of the Mines at the
times appointed for eating or sleeping;
this Drink serves 'em also for Physick
to make 'em Vomit, and cast up what∣ever
incommodes their Stomachs. A∣mong
these Savages they ordinarily
choose the best Workmen to break up
the Oar between the Rocks; this they
do with Iron-barrs, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
call <HI>Palancas,</HI> and other Instruments of
Iron; others serve to carry what they
digg in little Baskets to the entrance of
the Mine; others to put it in Sacks, and
load it upon a sort of great Sheep, which
they call <HI>Carneros de la Tierra,</HI> they are
taller than Asses, and commonly carry
Two hundred Pound weight; these serve
to carry it to the Work-houses which are
in the Town along the River, which
comes from the Lake I have spoken of
before. In these Work-houses which are a
Hundred and twenty in Number; the
Oar is refined, of which take the follow∣ing
<PB N="52" REF="135"/>
account. They first beat it well up∣on
Anvils with certain great Hammers,
which a Mill continually keeps at work,
when they are pretty well reduc'd to
Powder, they pass it thro' a fine Sieve,
and spread it upon the Ground about
half a Foot thick in a square place that
is very smooth, prepar'd for the pur∣pose;
then they cast a great deal of
Water upon it, after which they with
a Sieve spread upon it a certain quanti∣ty
of Quick-silver, which is propor∣tion'd
by the Officers of the Mint, and
also a Liquid substance of Iron, which
is prepar'd by Two Millstones, one of
which is fix'd, and the other is continu∣ly
turning, between these they put an
Old Anvil, or some other Massy piece
of Iron, which is worn away and Con∣sum'd
with Water by the turning Mill∣stone,
so that 'tis reduc'd to a certain
Liquid Matter. The Oar being thus pre∣par'd,
they stir it about and mix it, as
Men do when they make Mortar, for a
Fortnight together, every day temper∣ing
it with Water; and after this they
several times put it into a Tub, where∣in
there is a little Mill, which by its mo∣tion
separates from it all the Earth with
the Water, and casts 'em off together,
<PB N="53" REF="135"/>
so that nothing but the Metallick Mat∣ter
remains at the bottom, which is af∣terwards
put into the Fire in Crucibles,
to separate the Quick-silver from it,
which is done by Evaporation, for as
for the Iron substance, that does not
Evaporate, but remains mix'd with the
Silver, which is the reason that there is al∣ways
in Eight Ounces (for example sake)
Three quarters of an Ounce or therea∣bouts
of false Alloy.</P>
<P>The Silver when thus refin'd is car∣ried
to the Mint, where they make an
Essay of it whether it be of the right Al∣loy,
after which it is melted into Barrs
or Ingots, which are weigh'd, and the
fifth part of 'em deducted, which be∣longs
to the King, and are stamp'd with
his mark; the rest appertain to the Mer∣chant,
who in like manner applies his
mark to them; and takes 'em away from
thence when he pleases in Barrs, or else
converts 'em into Reals and other Money.
This fifth part is the only profit the King
has from the Mines, which yet are
esteem'd to amount to several Millions;
But besides this, he draws considerable
Sums by the ordinary Impositions upon
Goods, without reckoning what he rai∣ses
upon Quick-silver, both that which
<PB N="54" REF="136"/>
is taken out of the Mines of <HI>Guancave∣lica,</HI>
which are Situated between <HI>Lima</HI>
and <HI>Cusco;</HI> and that which is brought
from <HI>Spain,</HI> with which Two Vessels
are loaded every Year, because that
which is taken out of these Mines is not
sufficient for all the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>They use divers ways of Carriage, to
Transport all the Silver that is annually
made about <HI>Potosi</HI> for <HI>Spain;</HI> first they
Load it upon Mules, that carry it to <HI>Ari∣ca,</HI>
which is a Port on the South-Sea,
from whence they Transport it in small
Vessels to the Fort of <HI>Lima,</HI> or <HI>Los
Reys,</HI> which is a Fort upon the same
Sea, Two Leagues from <HI>Lima;</HI> here
they Embark it with all that comes from
other parts of <HI>Peru,</HI> in Two great Gal∣lions
that belong to his Catholick Ma∣jesty,
each of which carry 1000 Tuns,
and are Arm'd each with 50 or 60 Pie∣ces
of Canon; these are commonly ac∣companied
with a great many small
Merchant Ships as Richly Loaded, which
have no Guns but a few Petareroes to
give Salutes; and take their Course to∣wards
<HI>Panama,</HI> taking care always to send
a little Pinnace 8 or 10 Leagues before
to make discoveries. They might make
this way in a Fortnights time, having al∣ways
<PB N="55" REF="136"/>
the help of the South-wind which
reigns alone in this Sea; yet they never
make it less than a Months Voyage, be∣cause
by this delay the Commander of
the Gallions makes a great advantage in
furnishing those with Cards that have a
mind to play on Ship-board, during the
Voyage, which amounts to a very con∣siderable
Sum, both because the Tribute
he receives is Ten Patagons for every
Pack of Cards, and because there is a
prodigious quantity of 'em consum'd,
they being continually at play; and
there being scarce any body aboard, but
is concern'd for very considerable Sums.
When the Gallions arrive at <HI>Panama</HI> on
the Continent, they put their Lading a∣shoar,
and wait to hear of those from
<HI>Spain,</HI> who commonly about the same
time, or a little after, arrive at <HI>Porto∣belo,</HI>
which is 18 Leagues from the
North-Sea; in the mean time they carry
thither part of the Gold, Silver, and other
Commodities of this Fleet which are de∣sign'd
for <HI>Europe,</HI> upon Mules by Land,
and part by Water upon the River of
<HI>Chiagre,</HI> in Boats made of an entire piece
of Wood call'd <HI>Piragouas.</HI> A few days
after they are unladen, and after the Gal∣lions
are likewise arriv'd from <HI>Spain;</HI> a
<PB N="56" REF="137"/>
very great Fair is held there, for a Fort∣night
together, in which they Sell and
Barter all sorts of Goods necessary for
each Country; which is perform'd with so
much honesty, that the Sale is made only
by the Inventories, without opening the
Bales, without the least Fraud. The Fair
being ended, they all retire to the pla∣ces
to which they respectively belong.
The Gallions that are to return into
<HI>Spain,</HI> go to <HI>Havana,</HI> in the Island of
<HI>Cuba,</HI> where they wait for the Arrival of
the Flota of <HI>la Vera-Crux</HI> in <HI>New Spain;</HI>
as soon as that has joyn'd 'em, they con∣tinue
their Course together, passing thro'
the Channel of <HI>Bahama</HI> along the Coast
of <HI>Florida,</HI> they touch at the Island of
<HI>Bermudos,</HI> where they commonly meet
with Advice of the State of Affairs in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and with orders to direct them
how to avoid any disasters, and to per∣form
their Voyage in safety. As for
the Gallions of <HI>Peru,</HI> after they have
taken in a new Cargo at <HI>Panama,</HI> they
return to <HI>Lima,</HI> steering divers Courses,
because of the Contrariety of the Wind,
which keeps 'em Two or Three Months
at Sea. Being there, they dispose of
what they have for <HI>Peru:</HI> And the rest
of the Goods is taken off by the Mer∣chants
<PB N="57" REF="137"/>
of <HI>Chili,</HI> who give a great many
Commodities of their Country in ex∣change
for 'em; as Goats-leather, which
in the Language of the Country is call'd
<HI>Cordouan,</HI> Cordage, Hemp, Pitch and
Tar, Oyls, Olives, and Almonds, and
above all a great quantity of Dust of
Gold, which is taken out of the Rivers
of <HI>Capiapo, Coquinbo, Baldivia,</HI> and others
which fall into the South-Sea. And now
we are speaking of the Commodities of
<HI>Chili,</HI> some small matter must be said
concerning this great Province or King∣dom.
At the Mouths of those Rivers,
of which I have just been speaking, there
are good Ports, and Cities, each of which
consist of about 4 or 500 Houses, and
those sufficiently stock'd with People.
The most considerable Cities upon the
Sea-Coast, are <HI>Baldivia, la Conception,
Copiapo</HI> and <HI>Coquinbo. Baldivia</HI> is Forti∣fied,
and has a Garrison in it, usually
compos'd only of Banish'd Men, and
Malefactors of the <HI>Indies;</HI> the Three o∣thers
are Cities of Trade. Farther up
in the Countrey is <HI>St. Jago de Chili,</HI>
which is the Capital of all <HI>Chili,</HI> where
there is likewise a strong Garrison, and
some regular Troops, by reason of the
continual War they have with the Sa∣vages,
<PB N="58" REF="138"/>
call'd <HI>Aoucans.</HI> Beyond it in the
Mountains, lies the little Province of
<HI>Chicuito,</HI> of which the principal Places
are <HI>St. Juan de la Frontera,</HI> and <HI>Mendoca,</HI>
round about these Towns, there grows
a great deal of Corn, and abundance of
Vines, which furnish the Country of
<HI>Chili,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Tucuman</HI> as far
as <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>Three Weeks after my Arrival at <HI>Po∣tosi;</HI>
there were great rejoycings made
for the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Spain,</HI>
which lasted for a Fortnight together,
during which time all Work ceased,
throughout the City, in the Mines, and in
the Adjacent places, and all the People
great and small, whether <HI>Spaniards, For∣reigners,
Indians,</HI> or <HI>Blacks,</HI> minded
nothing else but to do something extra∣ordinary
for the Solemnizing of this
Festival. It began with a Cavalcade,
made by the Corregidor, the Twenty
four Magistrates of the City, the other
Officers, the Principal of the Nobility
and Gentry, and the most eminent Mer∣chants
of the City; all richly Cloth'd.
All the rest of the People, and particu∣larly
the Ladies being at the Windows,
and casting down abundance of per∣fum'd
Waters, and great quantities of
<PB N="59" REF="138"/>
dry Sweet-meats. The following days
they had several Plays, some of which
they call <HI>Juegos de Toros,</HI> others <HI>Juegos
de Cannas,</HI> several sorts of Masquerades,
Comedies, Balls, with Vocal and Instru∣mental
Musick, and other Divertisements,
which were carry'd on one day by the
Gentlemen, another day by the Citizens;
one while by the Gold-smiths, another
while by the Miners; some by the Peo∣ple
of divers Nations, others by the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
and all with great Magnificence,
and a prodigious Expence. The Re∣joycings
of the <HI>Indians</HI> deserve a par∣ticular
remark, for besides that they
were richly cloth'd, and after a different
manner, and that Comical enough; with
their Bows and Arrows; they in one
Night and Morning, in the Chief Pub∣lick
place of the City, prepar'd a Gar∣den
in the form of a Labyrinth, the Plats
of which were adorn'd with Fountains
spouting out Waters, furnished with all
sorts of Trees and Flowers, full of
Birds, and all sorts of Wild-beasts, as
Lions, Tygers and other kinds; in the
midst of which they express'd their Joy
a Thousand different ways, with extra∣ordinary
Ceremonies. The last day
save one surpass'd all the rest, and that
<PB N="60" REF="139"/>
was a Race at the Ring, which was per∣form'd
at the Charge of the City with
very surpizing Machines. First there
appear'd a Ship Tow'd along by Sava∣ges,
of the bulk and burden of a 100
Tuns, with her Guns and Equipage of
Men cloth'd in Curious Habit, her An∣chors,
Ropes, and Sails swelling with
the Wind, which very luckily blew a∣long
the Street through which they
drew her to the great publick place,
where as soon as she arriv'd, she saluted
the Company, by the discharge of all
her Canon; and at the same time a <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Lord, representing an Emperor of
the <HI>East,</HI> coming to Congratulate the
Birth of the Prince, came out of the
Vessel attended with Six Gentlemen, and
a very fine Train of Servants that led
their Horses, which they mounted, and
so went to salute the President of <HI>Los
Charcas,</HI> and while they were making
their Compliment to him, their Horses
kneel'd down, and kept in that Posture,
having been taught this Trick before.
They afterwards went to salute the Cor∣regidor,
and the Judges of the Field,
from whom when they had receiv'd per∣mission
to run at the Ring against the
Defendants, they acquitted themselves
<PB N="61" REF="139"/>
with great Gallantry, and receiv'd very
fine prizes distributed by the hands of
the Ladies. The Race at the Ring be∣ing
finish'd, the Ship and a great many
other small Barks that were brought
thither advanc'd to attack a great
Castle wherein <HI>Cromwel</HI> the Protector,
who was then in War with the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> was feign'd to be shut up; and
after a pretty long Combat of Fire-works;
the fire took hold of the Ship,
the small Barkes, and the Castle and
all was consum'd together. After this
a great many pieces of Gold and Silver
were distributed and thrown among the
People in the Name of his Catholick
Majesty: And there were some particu∣lar
Persons that had the prodigality to
throw away Two or Three Thousand
Crowns a Man among the Mob. The
Day following these Rejoycings were
concluded by a Procession, made from
the great Church to that of the Recol∣lects,
in which the Holy Sacrament was
carry'd, attended with all the Clergy
and Laiety; and because the way from
one of these Churches to the other had
been unpav'd for the Celebration of the
other Rejoycings, they repair'd it for
this Procession with Barrs of Silver,
<PB N="62" REF="140"/>
with which all the way was entirely
cover'd. The Altar where the Host was
to be Lodg'd in the Church of the Re∣collects
was so furnish'd with Figures,
Vessels, and Plates of Gold and Silver,
adorn'd with Pearles, Diamonds, and
other Precious Stones, that scarce ever
could any thing be seen more Rich:
For the Citizens brought thither all the
rarest Jewels they had. The extraordi∣nary
Charge of this whole time of Re∣joycing,
was reckon'd to amount to a∣bove
500000 Crowns.</P>
<P>These Divertisements being ended, the
rest of the time that I continued at <HI>Potosi,</HI>
was employ'd in compleating the Sale
of the Goods, the Inventories of which I
had brought with me, and I oblig'd my
self to cause these Goods to be deliver'd
in a certain time at <HI>Xuxui,</HI> and to pay
all the Charge of Carriage so far. I
took most of my Payment in Silver,
namely in Patagons, Plate, Barrs, and
Pignas, which is Virgin-silver; and the
rest in <HI>Vigogne</HI> Wool, and when I had
quite finish'd the business for which I
was sent to <HI>Potosi;</HI> I left the place to
return to <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> the same way I
came. I loaded all my Bales upon Mules,
which is the ordinary way of Carriage
<PB N="63" REF="140"/>
to pass the Moutains which divide <HI>Peru</HI>
from <HI>Tucuman.</HI> But when I was arriv'd
at <HI>Xuxui,</HI> I thought meet to make use of
Waggons, which is much more Com∣modious,
and thus I continu'd my Tra∣vels;
and after a Journey of 4 Months
happily arriv'd at the River of <HI>Lucan;</HI>
which is 5 Leagues from <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI>
where I met with <HI>Ignatio Maleo,</HI> who
was got thither before me; he came thi∣ther
by the River in a little Boat, which
we resolv'd to make use of, to convey
most of the Silver I had brought with
me, privately to our Ship; we thought
meet to take this Course to avoid the
risque we must have run of being Con∣fiscated,
if we had brought our Vessel by
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> because of the Prohibition
of the Exportation of Gold and Silver,
tho' this order is not always very regu∣larly
observ'd, the Governour sometimes,
suffering it to be carried out privately,
Conniving at it, for some present, or
else not being very strict in taking no∣tice
of it.</P>
<P>I must not omit here to tell the rea∣son
why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not suffer the
Silver of <HI>Peru,</HI> and of other Neighbouring
Provinces to be Transported by the River
of <HI>la Plata,</HI> nor all sorts of Vessels to go
<PB N="64" REF="141"/>
and Trade there without Permission:
It is from this Consideration, that if
they should give way to a free Trade
on that side, where the Country is good
and Plentiful, the Earth Fruitful, The
Air wholesome, and Carriage Commo∣dious;
the Merchants that Trade in <HI>Pe∣ru,
Chili,</HI> and <HI>Tucuman,</HI> would soon
quit the way of the Gallions, and the
Ordinary Passages through the North
and South-Seas, and through the Conti∣nent,
which is difficult and Incommodi∣ous;
and would take the way of <HI>Bue∣nos
Ayres:</HI> And this would infallibly
cause most of the Cities of the Conti∣nent
to be deserted, where the Air is
bad, and the Necessaries and Accomo∣dations
of Life are not to be had in such
plenty.</P>
<P>When we had secur'd our Silver by
the precaution we had us'd, I came to
<HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> with the rest of our Goods;
where I was no sooner Arriv'd, but our
return to <HI>Spain</HI> was resolv'd on. But
least any thing should be found on board
us to give occasion for any Seizure, when
the Kings Officers should make their usu∣al
Visit on our Vessel, before it went out
of the Port; we thought convenient at
first to Embark only those Commodities
<PB N="65" REF="141"/>
that took up the most room, as <HI>Vigogne</HI>
Wool, Leather of several sorts, amongst
others 16000 Bulls-hides, with a great ma∣ny
other Bales and Chests belonging to the
Passengers that were to return with us, and
about 30000 Crowns in Silver, which is
the largest Sum that is permitted to be carri∣ed
away, to supply all necessary charges that
may occur in the Voyage, and to pay off
the Ship. But after this Visit was made,
we made an end of Embarking the Silver
we had hidden, which with the rest of the
Lading might amount to about Three Mil∣lions
of Livers.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> in the Month
of <HI>May</HI> 1659, in company of a <HI>Dutch</HI>
Vessel, Commanded by <HI>Isaac de Brac,</HI> which
was also richly Laden; he engag'd us to
steer our Course with him, because his Ship
leak'd; and this fault increasing in the se∣quel
of the Voyage, we were oblig'd to put
in at the Island of <HI>Fernande de Lorona,</HI> with∣in
3 Degrees and a half of the Line on the
South-side. It prov'd well for us, as well
as for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that we stop'd here. For
having a mind for fear of the worst to take
in a new Provision of Fresh-Water here,
we perceiv'd the greatest part of that we had
taken in at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> was run out, and
of a Hundred Barrels, which we thought we
had remaining of our Store; we had but
<PB N="66" REF="142"/>
Thirty left. Therefore tho' the Water we
found there had a very flat Taste, and had
this ill quality, that it presently cast them
that drank of it into a Looseness, we were
however necessitated to fill our Barrels with
it. And an Accident unhappy enough
befell those of our Men that went to fetch
it from the Rock out of which it sprang,
for having stripp'd themselves almost naked,
to work the more commodiously, the heat
of the Sun scorch'd 'em so vehemently, that
it made their Bodies all over red, and after∣wards
those parts upon which the Sun dart∣ed
its Rays with the greatest violence, were
full of Buboes and Pustules, which were
very troublesome, and made 'em very un∣easie
for a Fortnights Time.</P>
<P>I went ashore to see this Island, which is
about a League and an half in compass, and
uninhabited. One of our Pilots told me
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> possess'd it, while they held
<HI>Fermanbues</HI> in <HI>Brasil,</HI> and that they had a
small Fort there, some small remains of
which were still left, that they sow'd Mil∣let
and Beans there, of which they had a
tolerable Crop, and that they bred up a
great many Fowls, Goats and Hogs. We
saw a great number of Birds, of which some
were good to eat; we continu'd there
Four days, but when we saw the <HI>Dutch</HI>
could not be so soon in a condition to con∣tinue
<PB N="67" REF="142"/>
their Voyage, being oblig'd to put
their Cargo ashore, and to lay their Vessel
upon one side to refit; we set sail, and af∣ter
a Voyage sufficiently troublesome by
the Storms we suffer'd, which sometimes
drove us towards the Coasts of <HI>Florida,</HI> and
sometimes upon others, we at last discover'd
the Coasts of <HI>Spain.</HI> Instead of going to
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> being under apprehensions of meet∣ing
the <HI>English</HI> who were still at War with
the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> we thought convenient to
make to <HI>St. Andero,</HI> where we happily ar∣riv'd
about the middle of <HI>August.</HI> We were
immediatly inform'd that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Galli∣ons
came to Moor at the same Port in their
return from <HI>Mexico,</HI> for the same reason
that brought us thither, and that they set
Sail but Two days before our Arrival. And
because the Officers of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
that had been sent to 'em were still there,
we thought best to treat with them, as well
to save the Fine we had incurr'd, for not re∣turning
to the place from whence we were
sent out, as that we might not be troubled
with a visit from them. And for 4000 Pa∣tagons,
which we presented 'em, we were
excus'd and exempted from any search. We
therefore put our Silver and other Commo∣dities
ashore there, part of which was after∣wards
sent to <HI>Bilboa,</HI> and part to <HI>St. Sebasti∣an,</HI>
where in a little time they were sold
<PB N="68" REF="143"/>
and distributed to several Merchants, who
Transported 'em to divers places to put 'em
off. When we had finished the Sale of all
our Commodities, there was an exact account
stated among those that were concern'd in
the Ship, both of their Charge and Profit of
this Voyage; about the detail of which I
shall not trouble my head. I shall only say,
to give a short account of it in Gross, that
the Charge consisted first in 290000 Crowns
employ'd in buying the Goods with which
our Vessel was Loaded at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and in pay∣ing
the Dues of Exportation from <HI>Spain.
74000 Livers</HI> for the Freight of the Vessel
for 19 Months, at the rate of 3200 <HI>Livers
per</HI> Month, 43000 <HI>Livers</HI> more for the pay
of 76 Seamen great and small for the time,
at the rate of 10 Crowns <HI>per</HI> Month one
with another. 30000 Crowns spent in
Victualling the Ship for that time, as well
for the Ships Crew as for the Passengers,
there being a very good Provision made, be∣cause
in those long Voyages beyond the
Line the Sailers must have good Sustenance,
and the Passengers must have a great many
Sweet-meats, good Liquors, and other Cost∣ly
things. More 2000 Crowns for the
Dues of Entry at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and in Pre∣sents
to the Officers of the Place; and 1000
Crowns in Custom at our going from
thence; more in Expences, Imposts and
<PB N="69" REF="143"/>
Charges in carrying our Goods from <HI>Buenos
Ayres</HI> to <HI>Potosi,</HI> and from <HI>Potosi</HI> to <HI>Buenos
Ayres,</HI> at the rate of 20 Crowns for a Quin∣tal
or 100 weight; more 4000 Crowns to
procure an Exemption from being search'd
and visited at our return to <HI>Spain.</HI> And in
fine some other Expences, as well in Cu∣stoms
of Entry, when we Landed our
Goods in <HI>Spain,</HI> as in some other things not
fore-seen, which did not amount to any
great Sums. These were almost all the
Principal Articles of the Charge, which
being deducted and paid, the Profit was
found to amount to 250 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Compre∣hending
that which was got by the Hides,
which came to 15 <HI>Livers</HI> a piece, that being
the Ordinary Price, tho' they cost but a
Crown at the first hand; and likewise what
was got by the Passengers, of whom we had
above 50 on board us, as well in going as
coming, which was not inconsiderable; for
one Man who had nothing but his Chest
paid 800 Crowns, and the rest paid propor∣tionably
for their Passage and Diet.</P>
<P>We were told at <HI>St. Andero,</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Vessels which we had seen at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI>
were safely arriv'd at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> but that
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassador being inform'd that
they came from the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> and
had brought thence a prodigious Quantity
of Silver and other Commodities, as well
<PB N="70" REF="144"/>
on the account of some <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants, as
for several <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had taken the
opportunity of the return of these Vessels to
come back into <HI>Europe,</HI> and had remitted
their Money from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to <HI>Cadiz</HI> and
<HI>Sevil</HI> by Bills of Exchange, besides the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Goods which they sent thither, had
given advice of it to the Council for the <HI>In∣dies</HI>
at <HI>Madrid,</HI> who judged this Money
and these Effects liable to Confiscation, be∣cause
all <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Prohibited from
Trading upon Forreign Vessels, and from
Transporting Silver to any other place be∣sides
<HI>Spain;</HI> and accordingly had seiz'd and
confiscated the greatest part of 'em, the rest
being saved by the precautions some of the
Merchants took, who were not so much in
haste as the others. The same Embassador
having remonstrated at the same time, what
would be the Consequence of Tolerating
Strangers to continue to trade in the River
of <HI>Plata,</HI> without putting any restraint
upon 'em, the Council had so much regard
to his advice, as to Equip a Vessel with all
speed at <HI>St. Sebastian,</HI> which they Loaded
with Arms and Men, to send to <HI>Buenos
Ayres</HI> with very strict orders, as well to seize
the Person of the Governor for having suf∣fer'd
these <HI>Dutch</HI> Vessels to come and Trade
in the Country, as to take an exact account
of the Acquaintance and Intelligence the
<PB N="71" REF="144"/>
<HI>Dutch</HI> had gotten there, as also to reesta∣blish
things so well there, in fortifying the
Garrisons, and in Arming them better than
they had yet been in time past, that for the
Future they might be in a condition to re∣sist
Forreigners, and to hinder their De∣scent
and Communication in the Country.
Soon after our Arrival, <HI>Ignatio Maleo</HI> the
Captain of our Ship, receiv'd an Order
from the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> to come to <HI>Madrid,</HI>
to inform the Council for the <HI>Indies</HI> of the
Condition in which he found and left
things at <HI>Buenos Ayres:</HI> He was desirous
that I would accompany him thither, which
I did. As soon as we arriv'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> he
gave in the Memories, not only of all he
had observ'd in the River of <HI>Plata,</HI> but
also of the means that might be us'd to hin∣der
Strangers from having the least thoughts
of Trading there, and that first by keeping
Two good Men of War at the Mouth of
the River, to dispute and hinder the Pas∣sage
of such Merchant Ships as should at∣tempt
to go up to <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI> in the
second place by sending every Year Two
Ships Loaded with all things the People of
those parts have occasion for. That being
this way sufficiently supply'd, they might
have no thoughts of favouring the descent
and entrance of Strangers, when they should
come thither. He moreover made a propo∣sal
<PB N="72" REF="145"/>
of changing the usual Way of carrying
Goods, which are sent to <HI>Peru,</HI> and brought
them by the Way of the Gallions; that it
might be settled on the River of <HI>Plata,</HI> from
whence he assur'd 'em, the Carriage of 'em
by Land to <HI>Peru,</HI> would be more conveni∣ently
perform'd, and at a cheaper Rate, as
well as with less Risque, than any other
Way. But of all these Proposals the Coun∣cil
of <HI>Spain</HI> relish'd only that of sending
to <HI>Buenos-Ayres</HI> Two Vessels laden with
Commodities proper for the Country. And
<HI>Maleo</HI> having obtain'd a Grant, and a Com∣mission
for this Purpose, upon the Assu∣rance
of it, we return'd to <HI>Guipuscoa,</HI> to
make Preparation for this Voyage, and to
set our Affairs in order; which we so well
dispatch'd, that in a little time, we had a
Vessel ready to set sail, which <HI>Maleo</HI> order'd
to be bought at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and to be
brought to the Port from whence we were
to go, being partly laden with <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
with other Commodities, taken up at <HI>Bay∣onne,</HI>
St. <HI>Sebastian,</HI> and <HI>Bilboa,</HI> bought in
gross at a Venture, in which Affair I was
employ'd, having undertaken it by <HI>Maleo</HI>'s
Commission.</P>
<P>During these Preparations, and while
we waited for the Dispatch of the Grant,
that had been promis'd him by the Council
of <HI>Spain,</HI> it happen'd that the Baron of <HI>Va∣teville</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="145"/>
being in haste to go into <HI>England,</HI>
in Quality of Ambassador from his Catho∣lick
Majesty; and having Orders to make
use of the first Ship that was ready to Sail,
took <HI>Maleo</HI>'s Vessel; which, yet serv'd on∣ly
to carry his Baggage, the King of Great
<HI>Britain</HI> having sent him a Frigat at the same
time, in which he cross'd the Sea. During
the Stay, which <HI>Maleo</HI> was oblig'd to make
in <HI>England,</HI> he made new Provision for his
Voyage to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and seeing his Grant
was not yet sent him, he thought it expe∣dient
to take a Commission, from the Ba∣ron
of <HI>Vateville,</HI> as Captain-General of the
Province of <HI>Guipuscoa,</HI> in my Name, and
that of <HI>Pascoal Hiriarte,</HI> commanding his
Ship to go in pursuit of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> on
the Coast of <HI>Brezil;</HI> that this might serve
us for a Pretext, to go into the River of
<HI>Plata.</HI> Being fortified with this Order,
we embark'd, and having stopp'd at <HI>Havre
de Grace</HI> to set <HI>N</HI>—ashoar, who thought
good to return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to solicite a
Commission also from the Council of <HI>Spain,</HI>
for the Two Vessels, with which we agreed,
that they should come and joyn us at <HI>Bue∣nos-Ayres;</HI>
we continued our Course, and
after many cross Winds, we arriv'd in the
River of <HI>Plata:.</HI> As we enter'd into it, we
met Two <HI>Dutch</HI> Vessels that came from <HI>Bue∣nos
Ayres;</HI> the Captains of which inform'd
<PB N="74" REF="146"/>
us, that one of 'em could by no means ob∣tain
leave to Trade there; but that the o∣ther
Arriving there before him, in a con∣juncture
when the Government was oblig'd
to send a very important Message in all haste
to his Catholick Majesty, relating to his
Service, was so happy, by the promise he
made of taking the Courrier, who was or∣der'd
for <HI>Spain</HI> on board him, as to find
means of disposing of all his Goods, and
of bringing away a very Rich Cargo, in
which he spake the very Truth; for he had
the prudence before he came to the Port, to
take out his richest Goods, and leave 'em
in an Island below, and only reserv'd those
of the greatest bulk to be expos'd to the
View of the Officers, of which he had made
a false Envois at the price of the Country,
separate from the general one, and had
made the Value of his Cargo to amount to
270000 Crowns. He agreed with the Go∣vernor
to leave these Goods with him, pro∣vided
he would give him for 'em 22000
Hides at a Crown apiece, 12000 pound of
<HI>Vigogne</HI> Wool at 4 <HI>Livers 10 Sous per</HI>
Pound, ane 30000 Crowns in Silver to pay
the Charges of Equipping his Ship; which
was perform'd accordingly. But under the
pretence of his Bargain, and while the Lea∣ther
was Loading in the Vessel, the Cap∣tain
under-hand sold his Richest Commo∣dities,
<PB N="75" REF="146"/>
and for the Value of 'em which a∣mounted
to 100000 Crowns, he got at least
400000. Thus the Captain of the Ship
and the Governor both made a great Ad∣vantage;
but this Governor whose Name
is <HI>Don Alonza de Mercado</HI> and <HI>de Villacorta,</HI>
being a very disinterested Man, and not at
all greedy of Money, declar'd that the Pro∣fit
of this business was for the King his
Master, and gave him advice of it by this
Courrier.</P>
<P>Being separated from these Vessels, we
came to an Anchor before <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI>
but for all the Instances and Offers we could
make one time after another to this Go∣vernor,
we could never obtain his Permis∣sion
to put our Goods ashore, and to expose
'em to Sale to the People of the Place; be∣cause
we had no Licence for it from <HI>Spain.</HI>
He only consented to let us go into the
City from time to time to procure Victuals
for our Men, and such other Necessaries as
we wanted. He treated us with this Rigour
for Eleven Months, after which there hap∣pen'd
an Occasion which oblig'd him to
use us better, and to enter into a sort of an
Accommodation with us. There was ano∣ther
<HI>Spanish</HI> Ship in the Port, the same that
a Year before had brought Troops and
Arms from <HI>Spain,</HI> to reinforce the Garisons
of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and of <HI>Chili,</HI> of which I

have spoken above; which contin'd here
all this time upon her own private business,
but the Captain that Commanded her could
not manage his Affairs with so much secre∣cy,
but it came to the Governor's Ear, that
he design'd in prejudice of the Prohibition
that was made, to carry away a great
quantity of Silver, and indeed he seiz'd on
a Sum of 113000 Crowns that was just rea∣dy
to be carry'd of, of which the Captain
could have no restitution made; and fearing
a greater disapointment, namely that he
should be seiz'd, he set Sail to return into
<HI>Spain,</HI> without waiting for any Letters for
his Catholick Majesty, with which the Go∣uernor
would have intrusted him, together
with the Information he had receiv'd
of the Intelligence the <HI>Dutch</HI> had gotten
in the Country, which he had a mind
to send into <HI>Spain</HI> with all speed, as
well as some Persons whom he had seiz'd,
that were guilty of holding this Correspon∣dence
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> among whom there
was a Captain, nam'd <HI>Alberto Janson,</HI> a
<HI>Dutch</HI>-man. The flight of this <HI>Spanish</HI> Ves∣sel
therefore oblig'd the Governor to alter
his carriage toward us, and to facilitate the
Return of our Vessel, which he thought
good to make use of, for want of another
to carry his Letters and Prisoners into <HI>Spain;</HI>
upon condition we would take upon us
<PB N="77" REF="147"/>
this Charge, he suffer'd us after a tacite
manner to do our business, and to carry off
4000 Hides; but we having great Acquain∣tance
with the Merchants of the Place, ma∣nag'd
our Affairs so well, that under the
Umbrage of this permission, we sold all
our Goods, and brought away a Rich Car∣go,
in Silver, Hides, and other Commodi∣ties,
after which without loosing any time
we took our Course for <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>At our Arrival in the River of <HI>Corunna</HI>
in <HI>Gallicia,</HI> we receiv'd Advice by the Let∣ters
which <HI>N</HI>—sent us to the Ports upon
all the Coasts, that there was an Order from
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to seize us at our return,
because we had been at <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> with∣out
leave. Upon this we resolv'd (after
we had sent the Letters and Prisoners, that
were committed to our Charge to the Go∣vernor
of <HI>Corunna</HI> by the hand of the Ser∣geant
Major of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> who came a∣bout
the Affairs of that Country in our
Vessel) to pass out of that River, and to
go 6 Leagnes from thence into the Road
of <HI>Barias,</HI> where I found a small Vessel, in
which I loaded the greatest part of what I
had on my own account, and that of my
Friends. The Governor of <HI>Corunna</HI> re∣ceiving
advice of it, dispatch'd a Hoy af∣ter
me to stop me, but I us'd that precauti∣on
and diligence, that this Hoy could ne∣ver
<PB N="78" REF="148"/>
come up with me, so that I happily ar∣riv'd
in <HI>France</HI> at the Port of <HI>Socca,</HI> where
I by this means sav'd the fruit of my La∣bours
and long Voyage. The great Ship
which I left in the Road of <HI>Barias</HI> had not
so favourable a Lot, and one may say, was
ship-wrack'd at the very Port; for having
left the Road of <HI>Barias,</HI> to get speedily to
that of <HI>Santonge,</HI> to secure all the Goods
she had on board, except 4000 Hides, of
which her Bill of Lading gave an account,
and having begun to put 600 Hides into a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Vessel that she met there, the bad
Weather constrain'd her to put in at the
Port from whence she first went out, where
she was Confiscated with all her Cargo for
the use of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> under the pre∣tence
before spoken of, that she had not the
Permission of his Catholick Majesty for her
Voyage.</P>
<P>While these things were transacting, the
Sergeant Major of <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> Arriv'd at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> having
Caused the Informations he brought to be
examin'd, which principally insisted upon
the necessity there was of sending new Re∣cruits
of Men and Ammunition, to aug∣ment
the Carisons of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and of
<HI>Chili,</HI> the better to secure the Country a∣gainst
the Enterprizes of Strangers, and al∣so
from the attempt of the Savages of <HI>Chili,</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="148"/>
immediately orderd Three Vessels to be
Equipp'd for this purpose, the Command
of which was given to <HI>N</HI>—. There was
good store of Ammunition Embark'd in
'em, but for Recruits of Souldiers, there
were but 300 Men, of whom the greatest
part were sent into <HI>Chili.</HI> In the same Ves∣sel
there were Lawyers sent, to form a
Court of Common-Justice, which they call
an Audience, at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> where there
were only some Officers for the Decisions of
Petty Matters before, the Greater Causes be∣ing
remitted to the Audience that is Esta∣blished
at <HI>Chaquisaca,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>la
Plata,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Los Charcas,</HI> 500
Leagues from <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>N</HI>—return'd from this Voyage,
he came to <HI>Oyarson</HI> in the Province of <HI>Gui∣puscoa</HI>
his Native Country, from whence
he sent me an account of himself, and we
agreed to have a secret Enterview upon the
Frontiers; accordingly we met, and gave
one another an account of the Affairs in
which we were both concern'd; and by
this account we found there were about
60000 Livers due from him to me, which
he has not yet paid.</P>

<SALUTE>Reverend Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Discovery that I and Father <HI>Be∣chamel,</HI>
have made of divers Savage
Nations on the Continent of <HI>Guiana,</HI> near the
Island of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> obliges me to draw up a
brief Relation of our Voyage, and to present it to
your Reverence, that you may know what Em∣ployment
we may have here, and how many
Missionaries may find a fit Occasion for the Ex∣ercise
of their Zeal. If I had had some Com∣panions
whom I might have left with the <HI>Nou∣ragues</HI>
and the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> I should have pierc'd
much farther into the Country; but the <HI>Nou∣ragues</HI>
who were our Guides, not daring to ad∣vance
farther into the Country of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> to
retain the good will of 'em both, we should have
left a Missionary in each of these Nations, that
the <HI>Acoquas</HI> might have conducted us to their
Friends, who (as far as I can conjecture) reach
quite to the <HI>Equinoctial Line.</HI> We might also
have pass'd to the West of the River <HI>Maroni,</HI>
and have enter'd into an Alliance with the Na∣tions
that extend to the River of <HI>Surinam,</HI>
upon which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have planted (1) a Co∣lony:
<PB REF="151"/>
but since we have confin'd our selves to
those Countries that are from Three Degrees of
Northern Latitude to the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI>
we need not be afraid that the People of any
<HI>European</HI> Nation will trouble us in our Mis∣sions,
because there's no gain to be made by
'em; besides, that we run the risque of being
Massacred by the Natives. 'Tis from your
Reverence that we expect Support and Assist∣ance
so far as you are capable, and shall think
convenient in sending us Missionaries of a Vi∣gorous
Constitution, of great Vertue, and of a
Disposition ready to suffer hardships; because
in these parts there can little or no Accommoda∣tions
be brought to relieve them in case of Sick∣ness;
for the less one carries thither so much
the better; besides that the Ignorance and Bar∣barity
of those People always give a Missionary
just occasion to fear, that they take up mischie∣vous
Resolutions against him at the very first
shadow of dissatisfaction they receive. I ex∣pect
here a good number of Missionaries to dis∣pose
up and down this vast Country; and I
hope your Reverence will not refuse this Re∣quest;
which obliges me particularly to recom∣mend
my self to your good Prayers, who am</P>

<HEAD>A
JOURNAL
OF THE
TRAVELS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reverend Father <HI>Francis Mer∣cier</HI>
having been sent from <HI>France,</HI>
in Quality of Visitor of the Missi∣ons
of our Society, both in the Islands,
and Continent of the Southern <HI>America,</HI> by
the Reverend Father, <HI>John Pinet,</HI> Provin∣cial
of the Jesuits in <HI>France;</HI> with the
Reverend Father <HI>Gerard Brion,</HI> Superior-General
of the said Missions, and Father
<HI>Mace,</HI> and Father <HI>Alarole;</HI> he arriv'd in the
Island of <HI>Cayenne</HI> the <HI>21st</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1673.
and parted thence Ten Days after: Du∣ring
his Stay there, he regulated divers
Affairs, as well Temporal as Spiritual; and
among other Things, finding we had yet
no Knowledge of any other People, but
the <HI>Galibis,</HI> and <HI>Aracarels,</HI> our Neighbours,
who dwell near the Sea, and among whom
<PB N="2" REF="152"/>
the Fathers of our Society employ'd their
Talents, with abundance of Zeal; he re∣solv'd
to attempt a Discovery of those Na∣tions
that lie remote from the Sea. It was
my Happiness to be chosen for so pious a
Work; and I was particularly instructed
by my Orders, to discover the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> a
very populous Nation, according to the
Report, some <HI>Nouragues,</HI> who frequent the
<HI>Galibis,</HI> gave us; withal, telling us, they
were a Warlike People, and us'd to eat
Men. One of these <HI>Nouragues</HI> being ask'd,
Two Months before the Arrival of the Re∣verend
Father-Visitor, <HI>If it were true, that
the</HI> Acoquas <HI>us'd to eat their Enemies,</HI> an∣swer'd,
<HI>That he came from 'em Four Months
ago, and then they had just made an end of
boiling in their Pots, and eating a Nation,
which they had destroy'd.</HI> I desir'd the Re∣verend
Father, <HI>Francis Bechamel,</HI> for my
Comrade, who has a great Deal of Zeal
for these Missions, and has an extraordina∣ry
Faculty of learning strange Languages;
besides that, he already understood the
Tongue of the <HI>Galibis,</HI> which many of the
<HI>Nouragues</HI> also speak; some of whom we
were oblig'd to take for our Guides, to
conduct us to the <HI>Acoquas;</HI> for we yet
know no other Way to come at 'em, but
through the Country of the <HI>Nouragues:</HI> And
Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> took care to provide some
<PB N="3" REF="152"/>
<HI>Galibis,</HI> to conduct us to the <HI>Nouragues,</HI>
who dwell above the Source of the River
(2) <HI>Ʋvia,</HI> and to buy some <HI>Cassave</HI> and
<HI>Paste</HI> of (3) <HI>Ovicou</HI> for his Voyage, which
we counted would be for about Ten Days.</P>
<P>This Father having provided all Neces∣saries;
namely, Three <HI>Galibis,</HI> some <HI>Cassave,</HI>
and <HI>Paste</HI> of <HI>Ovicou,</HI> in hopes of finding
by the good Providence of God, either Fish,
or Venison, with the Assistance of our <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI>
we left the Port of <HI>Cayenne</HI> the <HI>25th</HI>
of <HI>January,</HI> taking our Leave of the Reve∣rend
Father <HI>Brion,</HI> Superior-General, and
Father <HI>Mace,</HI> and Father <HI>Bechet;</HI> but par∣ticularly
of the (4) <HI>Chevalier de Lezy,</HI> our
Governour, who did us the Honour to con∣duct
us together, with the Fathers of our
Society, quite to the <HI>Canoo,</HI> in which we
embark'd in the Afternoon, having our Fi∣sherman
to steer the <HI>Canoo,</HI> and Three <HI>In∣dian
Galibis</HI> to row with our Two Ser∣vants.
All of us were of Opinion, That
our <HI>Canoo</HI> was too small, and indeed it
would have prov'd so, if we had embark∣ed
at the coming up of the Tide, for at that
time the Waves are very rough near the
Shoar; but we avoided this Danger by em∣barking
a little before the Tide came up;
so that we were out of all danger when the
Tide began to drive us into the River,
which gives its Name to this Island; be∣sides,
<PB N="4" REF="153"/>
our <HI>Canoo</HI> being very light, and not
easie to be turn'd, was very fit to get clear
of several little Falls that are in the River
<HI>Ʋvia,</HI> which we were to pass almost quite
through, 'till we came to the Entrance of
a lesser River, that let us into the Country
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> the first Nation that we
were willing to be acquainted with, that
by their Means we might find a Passage to
the <HI>Acoquas.</HI> Our Way was between the
Island of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and the main Land; and
in the Evening we arriv'd at the House of
one <HI>Deslauriers,</HI> that had settled himself
there; we continued with him for a certain
Reason, all the next Day, being the <HI>26th</HI> of
<HI>January.</HI> Since God was pleas'd to protect
and lead us by the Hand, as it were in all
this Voyage; we must confess, that it was
he who inspir'd us with the Resolution to
begin it by the River <HI>Ʋvia;</HI> for we knew
but two Ways of entering into the Coun∣try
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> one by the River <HI>Ʋvia,</HI>
and t'other by the River (5) <HI>Aproague;</HI> this
last is very difficult, because the Falls of the
Water are so great, that the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> and
<HI>Galibis,</HI> that live at the Mouth of this Ri∣ver,
require a very large Reward to per∣form
this Voyage; and indeed, are the
more unwilling to undertake it, because
they are afraid of those <HI>Nouragues,</HI> that eat
Humane Flesh: So, that when any of 'em
<PB N="5" REF="153"/>
go into those Parts, they stay there as little
time as they can: Therefore it is scarce pos∣sible
to go this Way, and if we had gone
it, we should have been altogether unac∣quainted
with those <HI>Indians,</HI> that dwell
on the Coasts of the River <HI>Ʋvia,</HI> and with
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> that dwell above the Source
of it. But without knowing any thing of
this before, we chose to pass into the Coun∣try
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> by the <HI>Ʋvia,</HI> and have
this Way visited that whole Nation.</P>
<P>The <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>January</HI> we left the Sieur
<HI>Deslauriers</HI> somewhat late, and therefore
proceeded but a little way that Day: Our
<HI>Galibis</HI> brought us into a Hut of the (6)
<HI>Maprouanes,</HI> as well to shelter us from a
great Shower of Rain, as to lodge us
(7) there that Night. These <HI>Maprouanes</HI>
are about Thirty in Number, who retir'd
from their Country, near the River of <HI>A∣mazons,</HI>
to avoid the Persecution of the
<HI>Portugese,</HI> and of those <HI>Indians</HI> call'd the
(8) <HI>Arianes,</HI> who have almost extirpated
that Nation: We found nothing there but
<HI>Cassave</HI> and <HI>Ovicou;</HI> and to the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI>
we had nothing but <HI>Cassave,</HI> besides
Two Fishes, and a Couple of Fowls, which
the <HI>Galibis</HI> took, (which serv'd us for Four
small Meals) and a little Piece of Fish we
met with at another <HI>Indian</HI> Cottage.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="154"/>
The <HI>28th</HI> we arriv'd at a Mountain, where
a certain <HI>Galibi,</HI> nam'd <HI>Maure,</HI> dwells;
this is Twelve Leagues from the Mouth of
the <HI>Ʋvia:</HI> And Two Leagues below this
Mountain, the Land upon the River, which
is hitherto very low, and almost always
overflow'd, is a high, fine Country, as far
as the Dwelling of the first <HI>Nouragues.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>29th</HI> we lay in a Wood, and so we
did on the <HI>30th,</HI> having pass'd by a Vil∣lage
of the <HI>Galibi</HI>'s, which contain'd but
very few People, to make the bigger Day's
Journey.</P>
<P>The <HI>31st</HI> we lodg'd in a <HI>Galibi</HI>'s Cot∣tage,
whose Family consisted of about Six
or Seven, but Three or Four of 'em were
absent.</P>
<P>The First of <HI>February</HI> we pass'd the Night
in the Woods, and on the Second we lay
at a <HI>Galibi</HI>'s Cottage again; and this was
the poorest, and most pitiful Hut that ever
I saw among the <HI>Indians</HI> of this Country;
there was in it only one Man, and his Wife
and Children, who had nothing at all that
Day to sup on. One of their Children
was much swell'd, and in a languishing
Condition, with a continual Fever, of
which we thought it could never recover;
therefore Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> baptiz'd it; and
the Consolation this gave us sweeten'd all
our past Hardships.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="154"/>
The Third we went ashoar in the Coun∣try
of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> after having this Day,
and the Day before pass'd Three Falls in
the River <HI>Ʋvia,</HI> and another in the River
of the <HI>Nouragues;</HI> but this was nothing in
comparison of the Falls of Water we were
to pass on the Rivers of <HI>Aproague</HI> and <HI>Ca∣mopi.</HI></P>
<P>And it was now time to land, for our (9)
<HI>Cassave</HI> would have been spent if we had
had but a little farther to go in those great
Desarts, and vast Forests, that are all along
upon this River; upon which there are
no other Cottages but those I have been
speaking of, and those of some <HI>Galibis</HI> and
<HI>Areacarets,</HI> who live towards the Mouth
of it, and are in all about a Hundred or
Sixscore Persons. This River winds very
much, and runs a Course of near Fifty
Leagues.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Galibis</HI> serv'd us in this Voyage with
a great deal of Respect, and gave us Access
to the Chief of these first <HI>Nouragues,</HI> to
whom we presented a Hatchet, to engage
him to enter into an Alliance with us; they
did not remember, that they had seen above
One <HI>French</HI> Man before in their Country;
so that the Women and Girls, who had ne∣ver
travell'd into the Country of the <HI>Gali∣bis,</HI>
were mightily amaz'd at the Sight of
us. If one might judge of the whole Na∣tion
<PB N="8" REF="155"/>
by these People, one might very well
say, the <HI>Nouragues</HI> are a very courteous and
affable People. Some of 'em could speak
the Language of the <HI>Galibis</HI> very well, and
serv'd for our Interpreters. They did all they
could to seek Provision, to treat us well;
but being unsuccessful in their Hunting, we
had only <HI>Cassave,</HI> and a little Meat at one
of our Repasts, but with great Demonstra∣tions
of their Kindness. We bought <HI>Cassave</HI>
of 'em for the Supply of the Men that be∣long
to our <HI>Canoo;</HI> and on the Sixth of
<HI>February,</HI> after the <HI>Galibis</HI> had been treated
with a small Feast after the Fashion of the
Country, they parted from us at about Ten
a Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>We also left this first Cottage of the <HI>Nou∣ragues,</HI>
on the Seventh of <HI>February,</HI> to go
a Journey of Four and Twenty Leagues by
Land, over very rugged Mountains; but
went only half a League from thence to
lodge that Night, being attended with Two
young <HI>Nouragues,</HI> each of about Sixteen
or Seventeen Years of Age, who were to
carry our Baggage; here we were to take
another Man, who had promis'd to carry
our Provision for us, which consisted of
<HI>Cassave,</HI> and <HI>Paste</HI> of <HI>Ovicou:</HI> This Man's
Wife, in this Second Hut, was ill of a Can∣cer
in her Breast, which so tormented her,
and had so exceedingly wasted her, that
<PB N="9" REF="155"/>
seeing her under so terrible a Distemper,
without the Help of any Medicine, we sup∣pos'd
she could not recover, and that in
Probability, she would live morally the
rest of her Days; for these People endure
their Pains and Hardships very patiently, as
we observ'd in all the <HI>Galibis;</HI> therefore we
resolv'd to baptize her: In order to this,
Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> took care to instruct her,
having already made some Improvement
in the Language of this People, and had
likewise the Assistance of one of our young
<HI>Nouragues,</HI> who understood the <HI>Galibis</HI>
Tongue. This poor sick Woman receiv'd
his Instructions very well, and was bapti∣zed,
which was an occasion of great Com∣fort
to us.</P>
<P>The Eighth, having Bread and Paste of
<HI>Ovicou</HI> enough to serve us Four Days, we
set forward with our Three <HI>Nouragues,</HI> to
perform our Journey of Four and Twenty
Leagues, over Mountains all the way, which
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> sometimes perform in a Day
and a half; but ordinarily in Two or
Three Days, when they have Women in
their Company. One of our <HI>French</HI> Men
of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> that came thence on the <HI>27th</HI>
of <HI>January,</HI> follow'd us closely with Seven
<HI>Galibis,</HI> and overtook us where we lodg'd
the Second Night, who gave me a Letter
from the Reverend Father <HI>Brion,</HI> our Su∣perior
<PB N="10" REF="156"/>
written the day he came away,
which gave us no small joy, for it con∣tain'd
a great deal of Good Advice, that
might be serviceable to us in our Expedi∣tion.</P>
<P>This <HI>French</HI>-Man was much fatigu'd with
his Journey, and sent his <HI>Indians</HI> before him
the day following, who in that one day be∣ing
the Tenth of <HI>February,</HI> went as much
ground as we could do in a day and a half,
by reason of the difficulty of the ways. He
having joyn'd himself to our Company, and
comparing our <HI>Nouragues</HI> with his <HI>Galibis,</HI>
found a great alteration, and could not
but admire the Meekness and Patience of
these Three <HI>Indians,</HI> but especially their
Respect. They carry'd our Provisions, yet
they durst not take any without asking, tho'
we had often told 'em that they might take
of 'em when they pleas'd. This day we
passed the River <HI>Aratay,</HI> which throws it
self into the <HI>Aproague.</HI> The <HI>Aratay</HI> is a fine
River, which comes from a Country that
is Situate between the Source of the River
<HI>Ʋvia</HI> and the County of the <HI>Mercious,</HI> which
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> say is a space of Land that
extends about Seven days Journey. We
were forc'd to pass this River <HI>Aratay</HI> which
is pretty wide and deep, and the Stream of
which is somewhat Rapid, in a little <HI>Canoo,</HI>
in much danger of being cast away, as this
<PB N="11" REF="156"/>
<HI>French</HI>-Man that joyn'd us happen'd to be,
when he repass'd it in his return, where he
lost what he carry'd with him; which
was all he had in the World. After this
we lodg'd a third time in the Woods, and
on the Eleventh of <HI>February,</HI> being very
weary we about Noon Arriv'd at the Cot∣tage
of <HI>Imanon</HI> the <HI>Nourague</HI> a Famous
(10) <HI>Piaye</HI> (or Physician) in all that Coun∣try,
where we found the <HI>Galibis</HI> that had
advanc'd before us the preceding day.
These <HI>Galibis</HI> mutinied against this poor
<HI>French</HI>-Man, and probably were the occa∣sion
of hindring the <HI>Nouragues</HI> of that place
from selling any thing to him; so that he
lost his Journey. Nay he was oblig'd to
entreat one of our <HI>Nourague</HI> Guides to car∣ry
part of his Iron Wares, which he
brought to trade with, because these <HI>Galibis</HI>
refus'd to help him. And there was no re∣medy
for it but Patience, since he was 80
Leagues from <HI>Cayenne,</HI> in a Nation that had
no Commerce with the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>We did not part with our Three Guides
without regret; but we could not detain
'em, because they were oblig'd to return for
several good Reasons. The Principal of
'em whose Name was <HI>Paratou,</HI> told us, for
our comfort, that in the place where we
now were, which they call <HI>Caraoribo,</HI> from
the Name of a little River that passes by it,
<PB N="12" REF="157"/>
we should find a great many <HI>Paratous,</HI> he
meant a great many <HI>Nouragues,</HI> as good
humor'd as himself. But we found a great
deal of difference in the Temper of those
Guides we had from <HI>Caraoribo</HI> to the <HI>Aco∣quas,</HI>
and of those we had before.</P>
<P>As soon as these had left us, we enter'd
into a good Correspondence with the Chief
<HI>Camiati</HI> the Father of <HI>Imanon,</HI> by presenting
him with a Hatchet; this is a very Famous
Chief, and the Principal one the <HI>Nouragues</HI>
have, and the next to him in Eminence, is
the Chief of the <HI>Nouragues</HI> of <HI>Ʋvia.</HI> This
<HI>Camiati</HI> the day after our Arrival came to
his Son's Cottage, (for his own is upon the
River <HI>Aproague</HI>) he may be about 60 Years
of Age, and seems to be still very Vigo∣rous:
His Countenace tho' lean has a War∣like
Mien, but withal he has a Savage As∣pect;
his Humour is but very indifferent to∣ward
Strangers, tho' mild enough toward his
own People, to whom according to the Fa∣shion
of the Country, he every day gives
the Good-morrow, and the Good-night,
from the Oldest People to Children of
Fifteen Years of Age. He promis'd us to con∣duct
us quite to the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> when his <HI>Canoo</HI>
was made, to whose Country he pretended
he would go himself, and desir'd but the
space of Ten Days to finish this <HI>Canoo;</HI> now
tho' we knew well enough after what man∣ner
<PB N="13" REF="157"/>
the <HI>Indians</HI> us'd to reckon, who are
often Three Months in doing what they
might perform in the space of Ten Days:
we resolv'd however to continue with him
to have the advantage of being under his
Protection; and to perswade him, if we
should find him make too long a delay, to
borrow another <HI>Canoo,</HI> that was at Five
Days Journy distance from us; and in the
mean time to acquaint our selves with
the Language of the <HI>Nouragues</HI> as much as we
could, which (as we were told) differ'd but
little from that of the <HI>Acoquas</HI> and <HI>Mercious.</HI>
The Language of the <HI>Galibis,</HI> which some of
us understood, and which was very Familiar
to Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> was some help to us on
this Occasion. This <HI>Nouragues</HI> Tongue is
not of an easie and soft Pronunciation like
that of the <HI>Galibis,</HI> but has a great number of
Words that must be pronounc'd with very
rough Aspirations, others of 'em can't be
pronounc'd without shutting the Teeth; at
another time one must speak through the
Nose; and sometimes these Three difficul∣ties
all occur in the same Word.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> immediately began to
apply himself to the study of this Lan∣guage;
and I made so much advantge of
his Labour in which he succeeded to admi∣ration,
that by means of the <HI>Galibis</HI> Lan∣guage
I made a small Discourse of the Cre∣ation
<PB N="14" REF="158"/>
of the World; to make these People
know something of their Creator. <HI>Imanon</HI>
the Master of this Hut was the first that
took delight in hearing this Discourse, and
after him the Chief himself; and Five or
Six others, as they were working would
repeat in that very indiffent <HI>Galibis</HI>
I could speak, these Words; <HI>God made
the Heavens, God made the Earth,</HI> &amp;c. Here
were many Men that had each of 'em Two
Wives, and one of 'em who had Three;
this did not hinder me from telling 'em in
the Account I gave 'em of the Creation of
Mankind; that God made but one Woman
for the First Man, and that he did not al∣low
one Man to have Two Wives. And
tho' all these <HI>Nouragues</HI> perceiv'd we con∣demn'd
their Custom of taking Two or
Three Wives at a time, yet they said not a
word against the Christian Law for not in∣dulging
the same Liberty.</P>
<P>Seeing these People so docile and pliable,
I was willing to try if the Songs of the
Church would please 'em, and accordingly
I sang the <HI>Magnificat</HI> in the first Tune, Fa∣ther
<HI>Bechamel</HI> and our Two Servants joyn∣ing
in with me. This was so grateful
to 'em, that afterwards we ordinarily sang
some Hymns three-times a day to their
great satisfaction. Nay some of 'em learn'd
to answer to the <HI>Litanies</HI> of the Blessed Vir∣gin,
<PB N="15" REF="158"/>
which we sang every Evening. In
the mean while our Chief's <HI>Canoo</HI> went
forward but very (11) slowly, and we
thought we had mnch better endeavour to
prevail with him to borrow another, with
which he comply'd, and sent Two of his
Men for this end Five Days Journey
from his House, to get a convenient one
for us.</P>
<P>It was the Twenty eighth of <HI>February,</HI>
when these Men parted from us, and see∣ing
him the next day which was the First
of <HI>March</HI> dispatch away another Company
of his Men, we thought convenient to
make use of this occasion to engage some of
'em to carry our Baggage, whom Father
<HI>Bechamel</HI> accompany'd, together with one
of our Servants, while I and our other Ser∣vant
remain'd with the Chief, that we
might give him no offence; because we
stood in need of his Protection.</P>
<P>After I had continu'd a Fortnight with
him, making all the Children say their
Prayers Morning and Evening, and repeat∣ing
my little Instrustions to the greatest
part of those I was acquainted with, but
especially to Three Young Men who were
well Marry'd, confirming 'em in the Reso∣lution
they had made never to take a Se∣cond
Wife; of which promise they seem'd
to make no difficulty. I set forward the
<PB N="16" REF="159"/>
Fifteenth of <HI>March,</HI> to seek Father <HI>Bechamel,</HI>
and to wait for the Chief of the Cottage,
who was to go by Water Five days after
with his <HI>Canoo;</HI> I had but Three Leagues to
go by Land, whereas it was near Fifteen by
Water. From that time I found those Peo∣ple
still more teachable, and when the
Captain return'd, among Four and twenty
Persons, there were not above Three, but
signified they took a great deal of pleasure
in my Instructions. During our stay here,
a Serpent came in the Night in the place
where we lay, and bit a Hound, so that he
died in 30 Hours after. This Accident was
Injurious to us, because the Chief, and the
Owner of the Dog attributed it to the Pray∣ers
which we sang; so that I durst not
Sing any more, but contented my self to
make every body in the Cottage say their
Prayers, except three (as I said before)
namely the Chief <HI>Camiati</HI> and Two other
Old Men.</P>
<P>The Ninth of <HI>April,</HI> after I had much
importun'd the Chief, that we might set
forward; he told us, he was not willing to
make this Voyage, and that all his Men
should go to set us in our way, and should
leave us when we went ashore to go by
Land to the Rivers that lead to the <HI>Acoquas,</HI>
whether Four of the Company should at∣tend
us. We understood that their Voy∣age
<PB N="17" REF="159"/>
was determin'd without any regard to
us; however we did not scruple to pay 'em
for it, being willing to make use of this
Opportunity, because it was no easie matter
to meet with another. However I oppos'd
the Design of having so many Men go with
us, because the Two <HI>Canoos</HI> they had were
too small for such a Company: This was
a great difficulty with us, and was not re∣solv'd
till the next day, when we represent∣ed
to the Chief, that we would leave
him our little Chest, that we would take
very few of our (12) things out of it for
our Voyage, that when we return'd I would
continue with him; that if he was not
pleas'd to assist us in our Voyage, I must re∣turn
to <HI>Cayenne,</HI> that then he must never
expect to see any of us again, and would
have no more of our Commodities; this
made him resolve to lessen the number of
his Men.</P>
<P>The Tenth of <HI>March</HI> we parted, being
Sixteen in Number, of which the Chief
would needs be one for Three days, that
he might bring back his <HI>Canoo.</HI> In the E∣vening
we went ashore into the Woods,
and on the Eleventh, after we had pass'd
several Falls of Waters in the way we made
the Two days, we Arriv'd at a Cottage of
the <HI>Nouragues,</HI> Ten Leagues from the for∣mer;
here we were well receiv'd, and went
<PB N="18" REF="160"/>
forward the Third day with a Third <HI>Canoo</HI>
which was very small; it carry'd only Two
Men, a Woman, and a Girl of Ten or
Twelve Years Old. We passed Two Falls
that were difficult enough, and Arriv'd at
a Third, which the <HI>Canoo</HI> could not pass,
which has oblig'd the <HI>Nouragues</HI> to make a
way to draw their <HI>Canoos</HI> by Land almost
half a League, this fall is at Two Degrees, and
Forty Six Minutes of Northern Latitude.
The <HI>Indians</HI> drew only the little <HI>Canoo</HI> by
Land; for the Chief left us and return'd
back with the Two others; and we who
were then Fifteen in Number went to Em∣bark
in a great <HI>Canoo,</HI> that was above the
Water-fall, which the Two Persons that
were sent by <HI>Camiati</HI> had borrow'd; Four
Leagues higher, we found the Mouth of
the River <HI>Tenaporibo:</HI> and went to lie in a
Cottage hard by, which was yet upon the
River <HI>Aproague,</HI> where we found Five <HI>Nou∣rague</HI>
Travellers, who were going to the
Country of the <HI>Mercious;</HI> besides whom
there was a Woman who had a little Girl
of Seven or Eight Months Old that was ve∣ry
ill. <HI>Imanon</HI> (of whom I have spoken)
was now the Chief of our Company; he is
the greatest Physician (that is the greatest
Juggler) of the Country: who tho' he is a
great Hypocrite, and very much for plura∣lity
of Wives; yet did not scruple to ac∣quaint
<PB N="19" REF="160"/>
us, that this Child was very Sick;
when we had examin'd the matter we jud∣ged
it necessary to Baptize her, which Father
<HI>Bechamel</HI> did, at the time when these Tra∣vellers
parted from us. I had before Bap∣tiz'd
a little Girl in the Cottage of this <HI>Ima∣non</HI>
immediately after it was born, because
the Mother of it when she brought it into
the World had left it in the (13) Dirt, from
whence they would not take it up for a
long time, being told of this disorder, and
finding they would put nothing under the
Infant to keep it from the coldness of the
Mud, and of the Night I baptiz'd it.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth we left this Hutt, and
presently enter'd into the River of <HI>Tenapo∣ribo,</HI>
which is very deep and rapid, tho' it
winds much; we were not the First <HI>French</HI>-Men
that had been upon this River; and
we have been inform'd that Three <HI>English</HI>-Men
were kill'd and Eaten there (14) some
Years ago by the <HI>Nouragues:</HI> 'Tis very dif∣ficult
to Navigate this River, meerly be∣cause
of its narrowness, and because the
great Trees upon the Banks of it when they
fall, often extend their Branches to the o∣ther
side, so that one must either pass over
or under these Trees, which is not done
without a great deal of difficulty. We lay
one Night in the Woods, and on the Fif∣teenth
Arriv'd at a Hutt where we conti∣nued
<PB N="20" REF="161"/>
to the Eighteenth, which was the
last Day we were upon this River, and in
the Evening we saw the last Company of
the <HI>Nouragues</HI> on this River, 80 Leagues
from the Mouth of it: This Company
consists of Four Huts, at a little distance
one from another, wherein there are above
Sixscore Persons, of a good natural Disposi∣tion,
and very teachable: There was not
one in the Cottage, where we lodg'd, but
was taught by us, to pray to God every
Day; this Cottage was compos'd of seve∣ral
Men, some of whom were single Per∣sons,
others were married only to one Wife,
with whom they liv'd very well; and there
is great Probability of making good Chri∣stians
of 'em. This Cottage is at Two De∣grees,
Forty Two Minutes of Northern
Latitude, and together with the Neigh∣bouring
ones, and two others at Two
Leagues distance, might give employ to a
good Missionary.</P>
<P>We left this Hut, on the Twenty Se∣venth
of <HI>April,</HI> towards Evening, to go
and seek our Guides, who were not far off,
with whom we advanc'd by Land, and
went only Five Leagues among very diffi∣cult
Mountains.</P>
<P>The Twenty Ninth we travell'd about
Ten Leagues, in a Way a little more plea∣sant,
and lay in the Woods as we had
<PB N="21" REF="161"/>
done the Night before. Our Three Guides
shew'd us Two Rivulets, which they said
were <HI>Tenaporibo</HI> and <HI>Camopi,</HI> that were ve∣ry
rapid; and Five or Six Leagues beyond,
<HI>Tenaporibo</HI> is Forty Foot broad, and full
Twelve in depth: And at Fifteen Leagues
distance, or a little more, the River <HI>Camo∣pi</HI>
is as big as the <HI>Sein</HI> is below <HI>Paris,</HI> from
whence one may conjecture what Compass
it takes in its course.</P>
<P>The Thirtieth we went to lodge upon
the River <HI>Eiski,</HI> from whence Two of our
<HI>Nouragues,</HI> went to the <HI>Nouragues</HI> of the
River <HI>Inipi,</HI> to borrow a <HI>Canoo,</HI> and so to
come again at us, where we lodg'd; for the
River <HI>Eiski</HI> runs into the <HI>Inipi.</HI> This they
did for our Ease, our Journey having been
very hard, considering our Weakness.</P>
<P>The First of <HI>May</HI> they came to us again,
with a pretty handsome <HI>Canoo,</HI> wherein
there were Three <HI>Nouragues,</HI> that never had
seen a <HI>French</HI> Man, or any other <HI>European,</HI>
in their Lives. Their Aspect was very
sweet, and they seem'd to be of a very
tractable Disposition; when they had seen
us they returned Home, and we embarked
in this <HI>Canoo,</HI> a little after Noon, and came
to lodge in the Woods, upon the River
<HI>Inipi,</HI> where our Guides (15) mended the
<HI>Canoo;</HI> and the next Day, being the Second
of <HI>May,</HI> having gone down this River,
<PB N="22" REF="162"/>
which has a very rapid Stream, about Ten
Leagues, we enter'd into the River <HI>Camo∣pi,</HI>
in which we we went Four Leagues
more, and that against the Stream: For <HI>I∣nipi</HI>
loses its Name, and with <HI>Camopi</HI> makes
a great River, which goes and joyns it self
to the River (16) <HI>Yapoque,</HI> Five Days Voy∣age
from thence. <HI>Camopi</HI> is very swift, and
has so many difficult Falls, that 'tis no easie
Matter to number them; we went up this
River the Third and Fourth of <HI>May,</HI> with
a great deal of Difficulty and Danger. The
Fourth of <HI>May</HI> we lay upon a flat Rock,
where we found a Piece of a Min'd Cot∣tage,
the Covering of which our Men
mended with Boughs: That Day we pass'd
through a perilous Place, not only because
of a dangerous Fall of Water; but like∣wise,
because it was commanded by a Cot∣tage
of <HI>Nouragues,</HI> which is the Last of that
Nation, the Master of it is a <HI>Morou,</HI> the
Name of an <HI>Indian</HI> Nation, one of whom
was hang'd at <HI>Cayenne,</HI> above a Year ago,
for killing a <HI>French</HI> Man: We had Reason
to fear, that he would, after the Manner
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> revenge this Man's Death
upon us; but one of our Guides, who
was also a <HI>Morou,</HI> had married his Daugh∣ter,
and we hop'd the Presence of this
young Man, whom we then took to be a
<HI>Nourague,</HI> would divert his ill Humour;
<PB N="23" REF="162"/>
as indeed it happen'd: And after we were
got ashoar upon our flat Rock, which is
in the Country of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> we were
greatly comforted to see our Three Guides
ask for their Supper by the Sign of the
Cross, where no Person had ever done it
before; and that, without having any need
to be put in mind of it. But that which
still increas'd our Joy, was, that the young∣est
of our Guides, who might be about
Seventeen Years of Age, after Supper, of
his own accord, sang in the Tune of the
Church, <HI>Sancta Maria, Ora pro nobis;</HI> ha∣ving
been yet taught no more than that. I
continued the Litanies, and he answer'd
me. Towards Evening our principal Guide
gave a Signal, with a sort of a Pipe, that
may be heard at a great Distance. The next
Day, being the Fifth of <HI>May,</HI> we had a
very rainy Morning, which hinder'd us
from going forward; but notwithstanding
the Rain about Nine a Clock in the Morn∣ing,
we saw three young <HI>Acoquas,</HI> who were
sent to know who we were, we went with
them towards Noon, and about Three a
Clock arriv'd soon after them, at the first
Hut of the <HI>Acoquas;</HI> which is at Two De∣grees,
and Twenty Five Minutes of Nor∣thern
Latitude. They were mightily pleas'd
to see us; for in all appearance, they had
some considerable time before heard of our
<PB N="24" REF="163"/>
Voyage. They so familiarly acquainted
themselves with us, that in Three Days
time, there was not one of them that refus'd
to pray to God; and we every Day put 'em
upon saying their Prayers Morning and
Evening. The Second Day our first Guide
brought us to two other Cottages not far
off; where we were entertain'd with as
much Kindness, as Strangers could desire of
a Savage People: Immediately, those that
liv'd about a Day's Journey more remote
receiv'd the News of our Arrival, and came
to see us. They all admir'd our Hats, our
Cassocks, our Shooes, a Gun; which we
made our first Guide discharge from time
to time, in great Companies of 'em; the
Pictures of our <HI>Breviaries,</HI> our Writing,
and the Songs of the Church, which they
desir'd to hear a great many times in a Day.
They heard our Instructions with Attenti∣on;
and seem'd to have very good Senti∣ments,
and to be much affected, when we
told 'em, that formerly the People of our
Country were ignorant of God, and that
some good People came into our Nation,
who taught us, that there was a God, who
would make us happy for ever in Heaven;
and what we were to do, that we might
go to that blessed Place: That we were
come to do them the same good Office, that
they might go to Heaven as well as we.
<PB N="25" REF="163"/>
That which gives me good Hopes of the
Conversion of this Nation, is, that they
heard those Commands of God with Re∣verence,
which are most opposite to their
ancient Manner of living. And this gives
me occasion to speak more distinctly of
what I have remark'd in these Two Nati∣ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nouragues</HI> and the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> in Mat∣ter
of Religion, are the same with the <HI>Ga∣libis.</HI>
They acknowledge there is a God,
but don't worship him. They say he dwells
in Heaven, without knowing whether he
is a Spirit or no, but rather seem to believe
he has a Body. The <HI>Galibis</HI> call God
(17) <HI>Tamoucicabo;</HI> that is as much as to say,
the Ancient of Heaven. The <HI>Nouragues</HI> and
the <HI>Acoquas</HI> call him <HI>Maire,</HI> and never talk
of him but in fabulous Stories: They have
a great many Superstitions, which are on∣ly
like the idle Tales and Fooleries of Chil∣dren,
in which I never observ'd 'em practise
any Idolatry: But I am very much afraid
their Physicians, by their juggling Tricks,
debauch the Women and Maids; for they
have given me great Reason to think so.</P>
<P>The natural Disposition of the <HI>Nouragues</HI>
and <HI>Acoquas</HI> is mild; but the more remote
from the Sea the <HI>Nouragues</HI> live, the more
tractable you'll find 'em; for the frequent
Concourse they have with the <HI>Indians,</HI> on
<PB N="26" REF="164"/>
the Sea-Coasts, renders 'em more uncontrou∣lable
and difficult to be treated with. 'Tis
certain, the <HI>Acoquas</HI> are quite another sort
of People, than the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Cayenne</HI> ima∣gine
'em to be, who account 'em fierce,
cruel, treacherous and perfidious, to those
they entertain, For if one may judge of
that Nation, by near Two Hundred of 'em,
whom we have seen, they are an honest,
affable, pleasant People, and are very at∣tentive
and ready to receive what is said to
'em. Tis true, they not long since exter∣minated
a small Nation, and eat several of
them; but I attribute this Barbarity to the
ill Custom of the Country, rather than to
the Disposition of the People; and this
seems the more probable, because being in∣form'd
Two or Three Days after our arri∣val,
that there was half a Day's Journey
from us, some of the Flesh of a <HI>Magapa</HI>
(the Name of a People that are their Ene∣mies)
whom they had newly kill'd with
another, while they were watching their
opportunity to surprize one or other of the
<HI>Acoquas</HI> alone; and besides, one of the Peo∣ple
of the Cottage having set before us the
Jaw of a young Man; we told 'em, <HI>This
was not well done, and that God forbids us
to kill an Enemy, when we take him Prisoner,
and to eat him afterwards:</HI> At this they
look'd down very much without giving
<PB N="27" REF="164"/>
one Word of a Reply. Another time, the
Master of one of the Cottages having heard,
that the <HI>Galibis</HI> to hinder us from underta∣king
this Voyage, had threaten'd us, that
we should be roasted by the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> was
fill'd with great Indignation at it, and
could not be pacified till I told him, I took
those <HI>Galibis</HI> for Lyars and Fools: Having
moreover, told 'em, I had been made Pri∣soner
of War by the <HI>English,</HI> and restor'd
to the <HI>French,</HI> without receiving any harm;
and that God would not allow us to kill
those we took in War; they seem'd pretty
well to approve of this Law. And tho'
this barbarous Custom is a Point so much
establish'd and receiv'd in all Times among
the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> and among the <HI>Nouragues</HI> too;
yet it seems, by what I have been relating,
to be no difficult Matter to restrain 'em
from this Savage Practice, of killing and
eating their Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Polygamy</HI> is a Second Obstacle which we
found against the Christian Religion a∣mong
these Two Nations of the <HI>Nouragues,</HI>
and <HI>Acoquas;</HI> for where there's one Man
to be found, that has but one Wife, there
are six, who have each of 'em two or
three. The Hope that may be conceiv'd
for the eradicating of this Vice, is, not
concerning Persons that are already pre-in∣gag'd
in this evil Custom, but only those
<PB N="28" REF="165"/>
that have yet but one Wife, and young
Men that are not yet married, who might
be perswaded to be content with one Wife.
I confess, there's no hope of working upon
the others.</P>
<P>The Way of Living among the People
of these Two Nations, is very agreeable,
and has something more courteous in it,
than that of the <HI>Galibis.</HI> For Instance, A∣mong
the <HI>Galibis,</HI> those that are married,
dine every one apart, and those that are
unmarried eat all together; and all the
Women, Maids and little Children, go to
another side of the Hut to eat. The <HI>Nou∣ragues</HI>
and <HI>Acoquas</HI> do quite otherwise, for
the Husband eats with his Wife, or Wives
and Children with admirable Agreement
and Union. They don't drink (19) much,
but are great eaters; and are always Fishing
or Hunting, in which they spare no Pains,
to get their Living. They are all Lyars,
as well as all other <HI>Indians,</HI> that we know.
And when they perceive their Lyes are dis∣cover'd,
they retire, seeming to be a little
asham'd, but will not fail to frame a Lye
again on the next Occasion. The <HI>Nouragues</HI>
endeavour'd to fright us with a great many
Stories of their own Invention, to make us
alter our Resolution of going to the <HI>Aco∣quas,</HI>
that we might spend all our Stock of
Goods with them; sometimes telling us,
<PB N="29" REF="165"/>
they had seen the Track of some strange
wild Beast; sometimes that the <HI>Caranes,</HI>
their Enemies, were running up and down
their Woods, and that they had observ'd
the Steps of Three of that Nation not far
from their Hut: But when they saw they
could not terrifie us, they did what we
would have 'em. This Vice induces 'em
to promise much, and to perform but little;
which also is occasion'd by the little Judg∣ment
they have, to esteem any thing ac∣cording
to the Value and Importance of
it; for this makes 'em not matter what In∣jury
they do any one, in breaking their
Word; nor how much they dishonour
themselves in so doing. To have a thorough
Conception, how common this is in these
Two Nations (which is also rife among all
the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations we are acquainted with)
one must compare 'em to little Children,
who esteem what they see only by Fancy:
They are also subject to Steal; so that some
times they must be narrowly watch'd, or
else they will be pilfering one thing or
other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nouragues</HI> make about Six or Seven
Hundred Persons, the <HI>Mercious,</HI> who dwell
on the West-side of 'em, are equal to 'em
in Number; the <HI>Acoquas</HI> are South of 'em,
and conceal'd from us the Strength of their
Nation; however, I suppose it may be three
<PB N="30" REF="166"/>
or four times stronger than that of the
<HI>Nouragues;</HI> for having ask'd an old Wo∣man,
how many Cottages there were on
one side, to which we pointed; she told
us, there were Ten; then pointing toward
the Quarter, where their Chief dwelt, she
took a (20) Handful of her Hair, to signifie
to us, the great Number of Cottages there
were on that side. Between the <HI>Acoquas,</HI>
and the <HI>Mercious,</HI> they told us, there was
the Nation of the <HI>Pirios,</HI> which the <HI>Acoquas</HI>
say, are equal to themselves in Strength:
On the East and South-East-side are the
<HI>Pirionaus,</HI> and on the East the <HI>Pirios</HI> and
<HI>Magapas,</HI> and in the midst of all these Na∣tions
the <HI>Morous,</HI> who are very barbarous.
These Nations all speak one and the same
Language, and are understood by the <HI>Ca∣ranes,</HI>
who are the Enemies of the <HI>Nou∣ragues.</HI>
They also say, the <HI>Maranes,</HI> who
are a very great People, understand the
same Tongue: On the South South-West
of the <HI>Acoquas</HI> are the <HI>Aramisas,</HI> whose
Language borders on that of the <HI>Galibis,</HI>
having a great many of the same Words in
it, tho' they are unacquainted with that
Nation. The <HI>Acoquas</HI> say, these <HI>Aramisas</HI>
are a very great Nation. If there be a Lake
of <HI>Parima,</HI> these People can't be Forty
Leagues distant from it on the North-side:
We could get no Account of this Lake.

There was not one <HI>Indian,</HI> who when
we enquir'd of them, whether they did not
know of a vast Place of Water like the Sea,
the Sand of which is <HI>Caracoli</HI> (for so they
call Gold, Silver and Copper) could give
me the least Intelligence of it. These
(21) <HI>Aramisas</HI> are in the same Longitude,
wherein the Maps place the Eastern Part of
the Lake of <HI>Parima.</HI></P>
<P>After we had been with the <HI>Acoquas</HI>
Twelve or Thirteen Days, the Air grew
unwholsome, by an excessive Heat, at a
time when there was very little Wind;
which seldom fails to blow in those Coun∣tries;
and indeed, 'tis that that renders 'em
habitable. Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> was taken with
a Tertian Ague, and the strongest of our
Servants also fell very sick: We therefore
press'd our Guides to return, since they
were not willing to conduct us any farther,
nor suffer the <HI>Acoquas</HI> to go and fetch their
Chief, who dwelt at the Distance of Three
Days Journey, from the Place where we
were, with whom we would have con∣tracted
an Alliance. These Three Guides
became insolent, upon the Supposition, that
it was to honour them that the <HI>Acoquas</HI>
came in such great Numbers; tho' in all
appearance, it was the Curiosity of seeing
us <HI>French</HI> Men that brought 'em together:
They became very troublesome, especially
<PB N="32" REF="167"/>
the <HI>Morou,</HI> who gave sufficient Indications
of his wicked Disposition, perswading the
<HI>Acoquas,</HI> that we ought to leave them
all our Wares; these so unreasonable Pro∣posals
did not much surprize us; but to give
'em good Hopes of our Return, we left an
(22) Iron Tool of Half a Crown Price with
one of 'em, who had but one Wife, upon
Condition, that I should have a great
(23) Hamock when I came again; promi∣sing
I would then give him a Bill and a
Knife, to make up what this wanted of the
Value of it. I made choice of this Man
on purpose to signifie what respect I had
for lawful Marriages; and he understood
me very well, and promis'd me, he would
not take a Second Wife, during the Life
of this he already had, with whom he had
liv'd at least Eight or Nine Years, for
they had a Daughter about Seven Years
old; however, this Project facilitated our
Return.</P>
<P>The <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> we embark'd on the
River <HI>Camopi,</HI> in Two <HI>Canoo</HI>'s; Father <HI>Be∣chamel</HI>
was in the least of 'em, with our
principal <HI>Nourague,</HI> and an <HI>Acoquas,</HI> who
had a Mind to go with us to <HI>Cayenne;</HI> and
I went in the other with our Two Servants,
the <HI>Morou,</HI> and the young <HI>Nourague,</HI> who
not taking care to guide the Vessel right,
let it run so near the Precipice of a great
<PB N="33" REF="167"/>
Fall of Water, that those in the other <HI>Canoo,</HI>
cry'd out, believing we should be lost: But
these Two young Men, with much ado,
brought our <HI>Canoo</HI> under a Rock, that brake
the Violence of the Stream, and getting up
the Rock, with all their Might, drew the
<HI>Canoo</HI> out of this Danger. 'Tis abundant∣ly
more dangerous to go down these Falls,
than to get up 'em; because they chose
those places where the Water runs less vio∣lently
to get the <HI>Canoo</HI> up with main
Strength, whereas in going down 'em they
take the swiftest Part of the Stream, so that
one runs a greater Hazard of one's Life,
than can easily be express'd.</P>
<P>After having pass'd these Dangers, the
Second Day after we embark'd, our young
<HI>Nourague,</HI> that had never run the like Risque
before, said in his own Language, <HI>God is
good, and is not angry with us.</HI> When we
came to the Place, where we were to go
by Land, betwixt the River <HI>Inipi</HI> and <HI>Te∣naporibo,</HI>
our Guides, who were well load∣ed
with Hamocks, and other things, which
they had bought of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> were not
willing to help us, which yet they would
have done, if that <HI>Morou</HI> had not put 'em
out of Humour: They walk'd very fast, as
the <HI>Indians</HI> are wont to do, when they
are loaded, and at last left us at Five
Leagues distance from <HI>Tenaporibo;</HI> but
<PB N="34" REF="168"/>
by the Goodness of God we got thro'
without losing our Way, by following a
Path, in which these <HI>Indians</HI> had thrown
little Boughs, in several places where it
was not easie to discern the Track; to sig∣nifie
which Way they went. When we
came within Three quarters of a League of
the first Cottages, we heard some <HI>Nouragues</HI>
calling to us, who brought us <HI>Cassave</HI> and
<HI>Fish</HI> to eat, and some <HI>Ovicou</HI> to drink.</P>
<P>The First Day of <HI>June</HI> our young <HI>Morou,</HI>
being drunk, treated us very ill, which
made us resolve to return to <HI>Cayenne</HI> in ano∣ther
<HI>Canoo,</HI> and in the Company of other
<HI>Indians,</HI> and the rather because our Di∣stempers
increas'd upon us. I had a vio∣lent
Fever, and a great Cough, and Father
<HI>Bechamel</HI> was very ill, as well as the lusti∣est
of our Servants. And now as we had
need of the special Assistance of Provi∣dence,
to find a Conveniency for our Re∣turn;
so it pleas'd God to manifest to us,
how particular a Care he took of our Pre∣servation,
in furnishing us with what we
needed; not indeed, at the Time we wish'd,
nor after that Manner we thought best, but
in such a Season, and in such a Way, as
was most convenient for us, 'till at length
we arriv'd at <HI>Cayenne.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Day of <HI>June</HI> we made an A∣greement
with the first <HI>Nourague,</HI> who had
<PB N="35" REF="168"/>
done us some Service at <HI>Caraotibo,</HI> Three
Leagues from <HI>Aproague,</HI> who was of a very
good Temper, and was come thither with
two other <HI>Nouragues</HI> of the same Place,
who had a Kindness for us, and were wil∣ling
to return Home as soon as they could.
We determin'd to set forward the next
Day, to prevent our <HI>Morou,</HI> and our other
Guides, who were elsewhere, from opposing
our Design. We were to go three Leagues by
Land, or Seven by Water, to get to this
Man's <HI>Canoo;</HI> but I was so ill, I could not
go by Land, and our Servant was asbad as I,
so that we were forc'd to seek a <HI>Canoo,</HI> to go
by Water, the Providence God provided
us a little One, which we hired, that was
sunk in the Water, but was big enough to
carry Four of us; namely, the <HI>Indian</HI> and
his Wife, our Servant and my self. Father
<HI>Bechamel,</HI> tho' very weak, had the Courage
to undertake the Journey on Foot, with
our other Servant. We were desirous to have
gone forward the next Day, from the Place
where this <HI>Nourague</HI>'s <HI>Canoo</HI> lay; but we
should not have been able to have under∣gone
this Fatigue: It pleas'd God to pro∣vide
for our Welfare, on this occasion, in
permitting the <HI>Indians</HI> to detain us Eleven
Days in this Place, where there were near
Sixty Persons: The Chief of whom, who
had a Son in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Cayenne,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="169"/>
plac'd us in a Cottage by our selves, that
we might not be disturb'd, with the Noise
of a great Merry-meeting they were going
to have, and order'd his Wife to treat us
the best she could: This was partly from
his good Humour, and partly to secure
his Son from receiving any ill Treatment
from the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Cayenne.</HI> God was pleas'd,
during our stay here, to give us an Oppor∣tunity
again, to instruct a Woman that was
almost eaten up with Cancers; so that she
was at length baptiz'd by Father <HI>Bechamel,</HI>
the Day before we left this Place: This Fa∣ther
was so weak, that he could not repeat
his Breviary walking; and yet the next
Day, he was strong enough to walk near
a League from thence to embark. There
now remain'd but one Difficulty to encoun∣ter
with, since we were in the Hands of
Three very honest <HI>Nouragues;</HI> and that was,
how to get away from <HI>Camiati</HI>'s Cottage,
with our little Chest that contain'd all our
Goods; and to find a convenient Passage
to the Mouth of the <HI>Aproague;</HI> for I had
promis'd <HI>Camiati,</HI> to continue with him af∣ter
my return from the <HI>Acoquas;</HI> and those
People are not very easie, when they see
us carry our Commodities out of their Cot∣tages;
so that we had Reason to fear, that
he would detain us with him, at least Two
Months, before he would conduct us to
<PB N="37" REF="169"/>
the <HI>Indians,</HI> that dwell at the mouth of the
<HI>Aproague:</HI> But it pleas'd God to remove all
these Obstructions; for our Three <HI>Noura∣gues</HI>
promis'd to convey us to the Sea, upon
condition that we would give 'em an indif∣ferent
Reward. And as we went by <HI>Cami∣ati</HI>'s
Cottage, we found he was gone a Hunt∣ing,
and those we found in his Cottage
were only his Two Wives, and some Stran∣gers,
who durst not hinder us from taking
our little Chest, and our Three Guides,
tho' they were affraid to displease <HI>Camiati</HI>
their Chief, yet knew not how to refuse to
lead us to a Cottage that was a League low∣er,
where at that time no body dwelt, and
hither they were to go in order to pass by
Land to <HI>Caraotibo</HI> where they dwelt, and to
conduct their Wives thither, and then to
come back again to us; tho' they would
fain have set us ashore at <HI>Camiati</HI>'s House, and
left us there.</P>
<P>When we Arriv'd at the empty Cottage, I
found my self so ill, that I thought I should
have died; but being somewhat recruited a∣gain,
and perceiving the Master of the <HI>Ca∣noo</HI>
had a mind to go and speak with <HI>Cami∣ati,</HI>
and that one of our Servants desir'd to
go with him, to fetch a Hound he had
bought that was run away thither. I gave him
an Iron-tool of half a Crown price to pre∣sent
from me to <HI>Camiati,</HI> that he might or∣der
<PB N="38" REF="170"/>
his Wives to prepare me a Hamock, and
bid him tell him I would pay the rest at my
return, which should be as soon as I had
recover'd my Health: this I did to prevent
his offering any injury to our Servant, and
that he might not oppose us in our design
of going back. The Master of the <HI>Canoo</HI>
told the Story of the Affront the Young
<HI>Morou</HI> gave us, and of the ill Condition of
my Health, so well to <HI>Camiati;</HI> that when
he had receiv'd the Present I sent him, he
would needs accompany me to the Mouth
of the <HI>Aproague,</HI> to the Cottage of the Chief
of the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> whom he had had a mind to
Visit a great while, being his very good
Friend. He came accordingly the next day
with one of his Sons, who was about Thir∣thy
Years of Age, and his Two Wives, and
sent home Two of our Guides, taking their
places, he sent the Woman, and one of our
Servants one League by Land. Our other
Servant continued in the <HI>Canoo</HI> to row, or
to use the Term of the Country to <HI>Pagay,</HI>
with these Three stout <HI>Nouragues;</HI> we also
remain'd in the <HI>Canoo,</HI> by reason of our
Weakness, which would not suffer us to go
this League by Land. They lighted the <HI>Ca∣noo</HI>
thus, that they might the better pass a
fall of the River, that was so rough and
difficult, that the <HI>Indians</HI> could not choose
but turn pale at the extreme danger we
<PB N="39" REF="170"/>
were in. One time amongst others they
toil'd so hard to keep the <HI>Canoo</HI> from being
carry'd down a precipice of Water, that
when they had made shift to get under a
Rock, that breaks the Violence of the Stream,
they were forc'd to rest themselves for half
a quarter of an Hour, because they were so
much spent, that they could scarce fetch
their Breath. I have twice been very near
being cast away in two Ships, but the sight
of this fall of the River was more dreadful
to me, than any thing I ever saw at Sea.</P>
<P>The Nineteenth of <HI>June</HI> we pass'd down
Two of these Falls, at the first they sent the
Women away by Land, and cross'd the Ri∣ver
to know of a <HI>Galibi</HI> that was lately come
thither to make a new Cottage, what course
they had best take to avoid being over-set,
because the Bed of the River declin'd, so that
it gave an extraordinary rapidity to the
Stream; and besides there were a great many
Rocks under water, against which we were
liable to be dash'd, and so cast away. And
observing our Men were in a great perplex∣ity
in their minds about it, notwithstand∣ing
all the directions this Man gave 'em,
we intreated him to conduct us through
this difficult passage, promising him a
Fishing-hook for his pains, which he wil∣lingly
undertook, and happily perform'd.
At the Second which was the last we met
<PB N="40" REF="171"/>
with upon the <HI>Aproague,</HI> we all went ashore
and walk'd along the River-side upon ve∣ry
uneven Rocks, and the <HI>Nouragues</HI> held
the <HI>Canoo</HI> by a Line which they tied behind
it, and so let it go gently down this place,
which is very dangerous at Low-water, for
the Flowing of the Tide covers it, tho'
'tis Twenty Leagues up the River.</P>
<P>After we had pass'd these many difficul∣ties
by the mercy of God; we at last had no
Cassave left, no Meat nor Fish, nor <HI>Ovicou,</HI>
when we were distant a days Voyage and
a half from the Cottage of the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> but
God of his Goodness was pleas'd to make
Provision for our great necessity; for as
we coasted along the River we saw a Dog
barking; upon which the <HI>Nouragues</HI> call'd
out to know if any body were a Hunting,
and presently to their great joy perceiv'd it
was their good Friend, the Chief of the
<HI>Sapayes,</HI> who came to us, and saluted us all
with demonstrations of Friendship. We
did what the <HI>Nouragues</HI> would not venture
to do, that is, to ask him to sell us some
Provision; acquainting him, that neither
we nor the <HI>Nouragues</HI> had any left. When
he understood in what necessity we were,
he sent to fetch his <HI>Canoo,</HI> which was a
large one, and very well stor'd with <HI>Cassave,
Ovicou,</HI> Meat and Fish (24) <HI>Boucaneed;</HI>
which he furnish'd us and the <HI>Nouragues,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="171"/>
and we paid him for it immediately. He
told us his Lodging was a League off,
whither he would come and meet us in the
Evening, and that because his little half-cover'd
Hut had only room enough for
him and his Men, we must make another
for our selves. He came according to his
word toward Night, and the next day he
made Father <HI>Bechamel</HI> and me go into his
<HI>Canoo,</HI> because he thought the <HI>Nouragues
Canoo</HI> was over-loaded.</P>
<P>On the 21st we Arriv'd at the Cottage of
this Chief of the <HI>Sapayes,</HI> where we were
kindly entertain'd. We were no sooner got
thither, but we began to think how we
should get from thence to <HI>Cayenne;</HI> and we
could think of no better way, than to per∣swade
the Chief of the <HI>Sapayes</HI> to conduct
us thither himself, which would have ta∣ken
up Three Weeks time, and would have
been a great charge to us, but the Provi∣dence
of God had made Provision for us,
for the next day we were inform'd that a
Chief of the <HI>Galibis</HI> would come the day
following to take a <HI>Sapaye</HI> with him to go
to <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Maroui,</HI>
from whence he was to fetch his Son, who
had been there with the <HI>Sapayes</HI> for Two
Years, as well as the Son of the Chief of
the <HI>Sapayes.</HI> He was willing to take us in
his <HI>Canoo</HI> for a small matter, and we went to
<PB N="42" REF="172"/>
Lodge at a small Island, which is in the
River at a pretty good distance from the
Sea; here we stay'd the Twenty fourth of
<HI>June.</HI> I observ'd that the Sea came up here
Eight Foot high, and concluded from
thence, because it covers the last Fall of the
River, that it declines but Eight Foot in
the space of Twenty five Leagues from the
Sea. In the Night they heard the Cry of a
Bird, and said to one another in the <HI>Galibis</HI>
Tongue, <HI>Hark how the Devil cries;</HI> I re∣prov'd
'em, telling 'em they were mistaken,
and that the Devil had no Body, but was
a Spirit as our Souls are, which they con∣fess
to be Invisible and Immortal, which
yet they do not say of the Devils, but pre∣tend
that their Physicians or <HI>Piaies</HI> kill 'em
with great Clubs. <HI>The Nouragues</HI> of one
Cottage made the Figure of a Man in the
the way by which they thought the Devil
came to their Cottage in the Night, to
make 'em Sick; that so while he stop'd at
this Fantome and took it to be a <HI>Nourague,</HI>
the <HI>Piaies</HI> that watch'd for him might take
their opportunity, when they saw him, to
knock him on the head. We parted from
this Island to go and lodge at <HI>Co,</HI> from
whence the next day we saw a great many
<HI>Canoos</HI> of the <HI>Galibis</HI> at Sea, which were go∣ing
toward the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> these
the Master of our <HI>Canoo,</HI> and the <HI>Sapaye</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="172"/>
went to visit, drawing their <HI>Canoos</HI> along
over the Mud at Low-water, and found in
one of 'em the Two Young Men they were
going to seek for at <HI>Maroui.</HI> They had
now nothing to do but to carry us to <HI>Ca∣yenne;</HI>
and because the Sea was so rough,
that they could not well bear up against it,
we desir'd 'em to set us ashore at <HI>Mahuti,</HI>
the first place we could land at in the Island
of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> which they compass'd with a
great deal of Labour. As soon as I set my
Foot upon the Sand, I fell down upon my
Knees to thank God for the Protection he
had favour'd us with for a Hundred and
Seventy Leagues, since we came from the
Country of the <HI>Acoquas,</HI> for our whole
Voyage was Two hundred and forty
Leagues. We went to lodge at the House of
Mons. <HI>Fontain,</HI> whose Estate lies in this part
of the Island; and he receiv'd us with
great Joy. The next day being the Twen∣ty
seventh, Father <HI>Bechet</HI> came to fetch us
with Two Horses, and we borrow'd ano∣ther
of (25) Monsieur <HI>Fontaine,</HI> and so
Arriv'd at the Fort of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> where the
Governor was pleas'd to treat us with all
imaginable Friendship. And all the Peo∣ple
came about us, to see us, and to signifie
the geat affection they had to us. In three
Months I hope by the Grace of God to Vi∣sit
the Marshes of the <HI>Aracarets,</HI> the <HI>Pali∣cours,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="173"/>
the <HI>Mayes,</HI> the <HI>Marones,</HI> and the
<HI>Coussades,</HI> whose Habitations stand more
thick and close one to another, than those
I have given an account of in this Relation.
Here's a great Field open'd to the Gospel-Labourers,
into which I am ready to conduct
those that are willing to employ themselves
in it, as well as to discover to 'em a great
many other Nations: Being fully resolv'd
by the Grace of God to expose my Life for
so Glorious a purpose, as the Propagation
of the Gospel, and the Conversion of such
Numbers of People.</P>

on which the <HI>English</HI> Colony depends,
which is pretty Numerous, and was Esta∣blish'd

This Fort was built by the <HI>French</HI> in 1644,
they quitted it in 1646, for the Reasons
that have been reported in divers Relations.</P>

<P><HI>Note (6) P.</HI> 5. This is one of the Nations
that fled into the Country of the <HI>Galibis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note (7) Ibid.</HI> In these Huts or Cottages
the <HI>Indians</HI> hang their Hamocks or Cotton-beds
when the Sun sets, in which they re∣pose
themselves all Night. They ordinarily
rise with the Sun, and then their Wives take
down their Beds and Hamocks, and hang 'em
in the <HI>Carbet,</HI> which is their kind of Hall or
Out-house, the Props of which not only
serve to support the Roof, which is made of
Palm-leaves, but also to hang up all the Beds
of the Men and Boys in the Family, and
those of Strangers, when at any time they
entertain 'em. This <HI>Carbet</HI> is plac'd Ten or
Twelve paces on the upper-side of the Cot∣tage,
in which the Women always leave
their own Beds. At one end of the Cottage
<PB N="47" REF="174"/>
they commonly make <HI>Cassave,</HI> and their Li∣quor
<HI>Ovicou;</HI> this part of it serves for the
Kitchin, and for all the Work that belongs to
the subsistance of the Family. Some of these
Cottages have a Loft above to hang their
Beds in in the Night; and then the lower-part
of the Hut serves for the <HI>Carbet;</HI> where
the Men spend the day (when they are at
home) in making their Bows and Arrows,
and what other conveniencies they want;
for their business is different from that of
the Women in these Parts, as well as in most
other Places. But there's one thing belonging
to the other Sex which the Men have usurp'd,
that deserves to be treated on in a particular
Article, of which I shall only speak a word
or two here by the by. They go to bed, when
their Wives are deliver'd, and receive the
Compliments of their happy delivery as if
they had endur'd the pain, and accordingly
answer their Visitors as the Women do on
the like occasion in other places. This Cu∣stom
is not peculiar to the <HI>Galibis,</HI> but is
us'd in a great many other Nations of <HI>Brasil,</HI>
and in other parts of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis farther to be noted, that their <HI>Carbets</HI>
are the places where they hold their Consul∣tations,
and deliberate on their most weighty
Affairs, which is ordinarily done with great
Solemnity; those that are concern'd and in∣vited,
assembling together from divers pla∣ces
for this purpose.</P>

<HI>Note (8) Ibid.</HI> This Nation dwells near
the mouth of the River of <HI>Amazons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note (9) P.</HI> 7. This is the ordinary Bread of
the Country, made of a sort of Root, which
they scrape, and then press to get the Water
out of it, which is a cold Poison, and will
kill Men, or Beasts if they drink but half a
glass of it; which for all that may be put in
Sauces and Pottage, and gives 'em a better
relish, provided it be but boyl'd tho' never so
little, afterwhich it has no pernicious quality.</P>
<P><HI>Note (10) P. 11. Piaie</HI> is a Name which
the <HI>Galibis</HI> give their Physicians, who besides
the practise of Physick pretend also to Divi∣nation;
but they profess neither, till they
have made divers Experiments, one of which
is so dangerous that it often makes 'em burst.
They stamp the green Leaves of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and
squeeze out the Juice of it, of which they
drink the quantity of a large Glass full; so
that none but those that are of a very ro∣bust
Constitution, who try this practise up∣on
themselves, escape with their Lives. Be∣sides
divers sorts of Plants, Gumms, and
Wood they use to cure diseases and wounds,
they have a way of sucking their Patients in
that part of the Body in which they feel
their pain; and this method is most com∣monly
very successful.</P>
<P><HI>Note (11) P.</HI> 15. The reason why they
employ so much time in making their <HI>Canoos</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="175"/>
is because after they have chosen and fell'd a
Tree, and have with a Hatchet made it hol∣low,
about the breadth of half a Foot, and
about the same depth through the whole
length of it, they hollow the rest of it with
a gentle Fire; and this work, which goes on
very slowly; continues in proportion to the
bulk of the piece of Timber, and to the
length they give their <HI>Canoo.</HI> This way of
making their <HI>Canoos</HI> is very tedious, but tends
much to their duration, so that they scarce
ever rot, because after they are thus made, the
Worm never touches 'em, which is also part∣ly
owing to the hardness of the Wood;
there being scarce any betwixt the Tropicks
but has this quality.</P>

have vent among these Nations are Hatchets,

to use their Children after this manner.</P>

<P><HI>Note (19) P.</HI> 28. 'Tis true, they drink
but little or nothing at their ordinary meals
till they have done eating, and then com∣monly
<PB N="51" REF="176"/>
drink one draught; but when they
assemble together, either for Warlike Enter∣prizes,
or to begin a <HI>Canoo,</HI> or to launch it
when 'tis made, and when they make a
Chief, or admit him into their Council, af∣ter
they have expos'd him to several rude
kind of Trials; they have extraordinary Re∣joycings,
which frequently hold 3 or 4 days,
continuing till they have drank up all their
Liquor; which is what the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Faire
un Vin.</HI> For these occasions they make 3 or 4
different sorts of Drink, some of which be∣come
very strong by fermentation, as that
which they call <HI>Palinot,</HI> which they make
with <HI>Cassave</HI> that is bak'd more than ordina∣ry:
The pieces of which they pile up one
upon another when they are very hot, and
keep 'em thus till they begin to be mouldy,
after which they mix them with <HI>Potatoes,</HI>
which they cut in small pieces as well as the
<HI>Cassave,</HI> and put them in great Earthen Jarrs,
then they pour a proportionate quantity of
Water upon 'em, and so leave all to fer∣ment
and work together till this Liquor is
as strong as they desire; which is after about
5 or 6 days fermentation. They strain it
before they use it, and then 'tis of the Co∣lour
and Consistence of Beer, of a much bet∣ter
tast, but much more heady and intoxi∣cating.
They have besides a great many
sorts of drink, the diversity of which Results
<PB N="52" REF="177"/>
from the different Fruits of which they make
'em. But that which they ordinarily make use
of, is as white as Milk, and of the same con∣sistence.
It is very refreshing and nourish∣ing,
and is compos'd of <HI>Cassave</HI> bak'd after
their ordinary manner, and <HI>Potatoes</HI> boil'd
with it, till they are of the consistence of
Paste, this they put into Baskets lin'd with
the Leaves of <HI>Bonano</HI>-trees, in which it keeps
good for a Month, and then begins to grow
sower, but not quite so soon if it be kept in
a cool place. When they use it they steep
as much as they have present occasion for in
a sufficient quantity of Water, and if they
are at leisure they strain it: But they often
only steep it, and drink it without straining,
and if Sugar or Sugar-cains bruis'd be mix'd
with it, it comes very near the tast, and co∣lour,
and consistence of <HI>Orgeate,</HI> the use of
which the <HI>French</HI> have taken from the <HI>Ita∣lians</HI>
some Years since. This drink is call'd
<HI>Ovacou</HI> upon the Continent; and <HI>Ovicou</HI> in
the Islands. 'Tis believ'd that the reason
why the <HI>Europeans</HI> can never attain to make
it so good as the <HI>Indians</HI> do, is because these
chew the <HI>Potatoes</HI> and <HI>Cassave,</HI> before they
boil 'em together, and understand better
what degree of boyling they require, to give
this Liquor its greatest perfection. But the
seeing this way of its preparation turns ones
stomach more than the reading of it; and
<PB N="53" REF="177"/>
the Wine that washes the dirty Feet of the
Grape-gatherers as they tread the Grapes is
no less nauseous, but the Fermentation
both of the one and the other corrects all
this uncleanliness.</P>

towards the Source of the River <HI>Maroni,</HI>

or Axes, Bills, with Wooden Handles,
others with Iron Handles, in the Socket of
which they may be fix'd or taken off at
Pleasure; and such little Planing-Axes,
as Cooper's Use; this Tool serves the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
in making their <HI>Canoos,</HI> particularly
in hollowing the inside of the Tree, they
design for that use: They also use Plains
to smooth the outside of the <HI>Canoos,</HI> as well
as for other Works.</P>
<P><HI>Note (23) Ibid.</HI> A Hamock is an <HI>Indian</HI>
Bed, made of Cotton; tho' they all hang
'em up by the two ends, when they would
lie in 'em, sometimes upon 2 Trees, at 10
or 12 Foot distance, and sometimes at two
of the Posts that support their Houses, or
their Carbets; yet they differ very much
both in the Stuff and Work. For Instance,
All the Hamocks that are made from the
River of <HI>Amazons</HI> to the <HI>Orenoque,</HI> are of
Cotton, made full, and almost all without
Fringe on the sides; most of 'em colour'd
with <HI>Rocou,</HI> or red Paint, quarter'd in Flou∣rishes
that are made with pretty good Pro∣portion
and exactness; these are most esteem'd
for Use, especially in the Islands, because
they last a great while; and are stronger
than those of <HI>Brazil,</HI> which are so thin, one
may generally see through 'em, and are made
of twin'd Cotton, much finer than those of
<HI>Guiana,</HI> which are also made of twisted
<PB N="55" REF="178"/>
Cotton-thread, but courser. Those of <HI>Brazil</HI>
have all a great Fringe on each side, and have
for the most part very much work about 'em,
the <HI>Brazilian</HI> Women are so ingenious, that
there is scarce two of their Cotton Beds in
a hundred, which are brought from the same
place, that are made just alike: The <HI>Galibis</HI>
paint most of 'em Red, after they are made,
and while they are yet upon the Loom. The
<HI>Brazilian</HI> Women make scarce any but white
Hamocks; and if they mix either Red, or
Blue, or Green, with the White, or all of
'em together (as they do frequently) they
work 'em with Thread ready dyed, and so
the Men don't touch 'em; whereas in <HI>Gui∣ana</HI>
these Beds are painted only by the Men,
the Women leaving this Work to them,
when they have finished the Web: They
weave 'em after the following Manner, as
well in <HI>Brezil</HI> as in <HI>Guiana.</HI> All their Imple∣ments
are two round Sticks, about 8 or 9
Foot long, and 3 or 4 Inches Diameter;
the two Ends of one of these round Sticks
lie a-cross upon two Pieces of Wood, about
8 or 9 Foot from the Ground, more or less,
according to the Length the Work-woman
is order'd, or designs her self to make her
Bed. The other round Stick hangs direct∣ly
under this, and 'tis to these two round
Sticks that the Warp of the Hamock is fa∣sten'd,
after which they have a kind of
<PB N="56" REF="179"/>
Shuttle, which they put through the
Threads, to weave it after the Manner of
our Gloth: But because they put their Shuttle
through Thread by Thread, one above and
the other below; this Work is extreamly
tedious, and has need of no less Patience
than theirs.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Brazil</HI> having much more work
about 'em, require the more Time and In∣dustry
to make 'em; but one sort and ano∣ther
are very much bought in the Islands,
where almost all the <HI>Europeans</HI> make use of
'em; and they are very good to use in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
especially in those Places, where they
have but bad and uncleanly Beds, particular∣ly
<HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> whither one might carry
'em without much trouble, they being very
light; for the biggest of 'em don't weigh
above 5 or 6 Pound, and those of <HI>Brazil</HI> not
above half so much, because they are thin
and fine; with 2 Pegs, or 2 great Nails
they may be hang'd up any where. The <HI>In∣dians</HI>
place the Props of their Houses at a
convenient distance one from another, for
this Purpose: They don't go out far into
the Country without these Beds; and there
are always enough left in their Houses for
Strangers.</P>
<P>This sort of Beds is likewise us'd almost
in all Southern <HI>America,</HI> to carry wounded
or sick People in; those that are put to this
<PB N="57" REF="179"/>
use, have at each end a great Ring, through
which they put a Pole of a sufficient length
for the Bed, and strong enough to bear a
Man's Weight: And thus two <HI>Indians,</HI> one
before and t'other behind, carry the sick
Man, supported in his Hamock, by the Pole
which they bear upon their Shoulders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arouagues,</HI> the <HI>Araotes,</HI> and most of
the other Nations, toward the River <HI>Ore∣noque,</HI>
make their Beds of the Thread of
<HI>Pite,</HI> in Net-work, which they hang up af∣ter
the Manner the other do their Cotton
Hamocks. <HI>Pite</HI> is a kind of Hemp or Flax, but
much longer and whiter, of this they make
their Cords for the Tackling of the Masts
and Sails of their <HI>Canoos,</HI> as for other Oc∣casions;
this <HI>Pite</HI> is also much lighter and
stronger than Hemp, and nothing near so
apt to rot in the Water; they make very
fine Thread of it to mend their Arrows,
and for other such uses. Perhaps the <HI>Aloe
Yuccae foliis, Catal. Plantar. Jamaic.</HI> p. 118.</P>
<P><HI>Note (24) P. 40. Boucanee</HI> that is, dry'd
without being salted, upon a kind of Grate
made of Sticks, plac'd about 3 Foot above
the Fire, they <HI>Boucanee</HI> Meat as well as Fish;
and the Word <HI>Boucaniers</HI> comes from this,
because they usually live upon Meat or
Fish dress'd after this Manner. This Name
was given to the <HI>French</HI> in the Island of
St. <HI>Domingo;</HI> because, before they had
<PB N="58" REF="180"/>
Houses, as they now have in the Western
Part of the Island, they liv'd only upon
Beef thus dress'd; and sold the Hides of
the Bulls and Cows, which they kill'd, to
the Captains of Ships, for Guns, Powder
and Shot, Shirts and Drawers, which was
all their Equipage. They were then Vaga∣bonds
in the Island, and had no Houses,
but now are settled there, and plant a great
deal of Tobacco in spight of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI>
They are under the Command of the Go∣vernour
of <HI>la Tortue,</HI> a small Island that
lies near St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> on the West-side:
And 'tis suppos'd, that the Number of these
<HI>Boucaniers</HI> surpasses that of all the rest of the
<HI>French</HI> in those <HI>American</HI> Islands, call'd the
<HI>Antilles.</HI> These <HI>Boucaniers</HI> have perform'd
such surprizing Exploits against the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
at <HI>Porto-Velo,</HI> at <HI>Panama,</HI> in <HI>New Spain,</HI>
and elsewhere, that what we are told in
the Accounts of the Country concerning
'em are almost incredible, but that a <HI>Spani∣ard</HI>
has lately taken care to immortalize
their Memory; who has in his own Lan∣guage
given us the History of divers Ex∣peditions
of these Adventurers, in a Vo∣lumn
in <HI>4to.</HI> Printed at <HI>Cologne,</HI> in the
Year 1681, with Figures.</P>

<HEAD>A
RELATION
OF
GƲIANA,
AND OF THE
COMMERCE
THAT
May be Settled there.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GƲiana</HI> is a great Country, on the Con∣tinent
of Northern <HI>America,</HI> which
extends in Latitude, from the Equi∣noctial
Line, to the Tenth Degree, on the
side of the Arctique Pole, and in Longi∣tude
from the River of <HI>Amazons</HI> to the <HI>O∣renoque,</HI>
which contains near Four Hun∣dred
Leagues on the Sea-Coasts, with an
immense Stretch into the Countries that
border upon <HI>Brazil,</HI> on the South-side, and
<HI>New Audalousia</HI> on the West.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="181"/>
Our <HI>French</HI> Seamen are wont to call <HI>Gui∣ana</HI>
by the Name, of the <HI>North-Cape,</HI> be∣cause
that is the most remarkable Cape on
that Coast; and those that have Business in
those Parts, commonly put ashoar there, to
get some Knowledge of the Country.</P>
<P>This Cape is between the 2 and 3 De∣grees
of Northern Latitude, and between
the 345 and the 346 Degrees of Longitude.
This Part of the Continent is water'd with
abundance of Rivers, some of which will
carry great Vessels up a considerable Way
beyond the Mouths of 'em; and upon the
Shoars of 'em; an infinite Number of Plan∣tations
might be made, which would turn
to a very considerable Account, as well in
regard of the Traffick that might be made
with the Natives, and the Fishing-Trade
that might be carried on in these Rivers,
and along the Sea-Coast, as of the Pro∣duct
of the Labour and Industry of the
Planters.</P>
<P>The divers Settlements the <HI>French</HI> have
made there at different Times, sufficiently
prove the Possibility of living in good Cor∣respondence
with the <HI>Indians,</HI> provided
they be treated civilly; and with more
Honesty and Sincerity than
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Monsieur <HI>de la Barre</HI> had not yet made a Settlement there, when this Account was writ∣ten.</NOTE> they have done, who have
hitherto had the Conduct of
these kind of Enterprizes,
<PB N="61" REF="181"/>
fall into their Hands. The ill Treatment
the Natives have receiv'd from them, for
which they have sometimes made them∣selves
amends by way of Reprizal, have not
render'd 'em irreconcileable, as we have been
taught by Experience, when we have made
tryal of it on different Occasions.</P>
<P>They are tolerably endued with good
Sense, which they have opportunity to cul∣tivate
and refine by a long Train of Expe∣riences,
with which the many Years they
live, furnish 'em: For they count a Man
dies young, if he don't live above 100 Years.</P>
<P>They have a pretty good Judgment, and
have good rational Thoughts, about things
within the Compass of their Notice, and
within the Reach of the Light of Nature,
with which alone they are furnish'd.</P>
<P>They observe their Words with great Ex∣actness,
and inviolably practise the Maxim,
of not doing to others, what they would
not have others do to them.</P>
<P>They are rather inclin'd to Peace than
War, which yet they engage in, either when
they have some just Quarrel, or when Re∣venge
or Honour prompt 'em to it.</P>
<P>They are sufficiently industrious, and al∣though
they have both Patience and Skill
in Fishing and Hunting, yet they have the
Fore-sight, not to let their Subsistance de∣pend
upon Hazard; and therefore willing∣ly
<PB N="62" REF="182"/>
cultivate their Ground, in proportion
to their Occasions, and the Bigness of their
Families.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Europe</HI> had furnish'd them with
Tools of Iron and Steel for this Purpose,
they made themselves some of hard Stones;
but besides that the Labour of making 'em
was intolerable, the Pains they took in
using of 'em, was also so very great, that
they laid aside the use of 'em, as soon as they
found they could do more Work in a Day
with our Hatchets, Bills and Knives, than
they could do in 6 Months with their Stone
Tools; which now are good for nothing,
but to be kept in the Closets of the Curious,
as so many Proofs of the wonderful Pati∣ence
of those People.</P>
<P>They speak a Tongue, which is not only
understood by all the Nations, which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> on one side, and the <HI>Portugese</HI> on
the other, have oblig'd to retire into <HI>Gui∣ana;</HI>
but is also intelligible to the <HI>Carraibes,</HI>
who are the Natives of the <HI>Antilles,</HI> and
use this Language: Which I have known
by the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Isles of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI>
St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and others where I had occa∣sion
to converse with them. In short, this
Language is spoken for the Space of above
Four Hundred Leagues on the Sea-Coasts,
and in many Places above Sixscore Leagues
up in the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="182"/>
They bring up all sorts of tame Fowl,
which they exchange with us for Toys, as
well as wild Fowl, and other Game, which
is there in great Plenty; as also abundance,
both of Sea, and Fresh-water Fish.</P>
<P>They build us Houses after their Fashion,
which are commodious enough for the
Country; they clear our Ground and car∣ry
our Letters, they serve to load and un∣load
Merchant Ships; and in a Word,
there's scarce any kind of Service but may
be obtain'd of 'em by a courteous Carriage,
and by giving 'em a few Trifles of a small
Value, when they have occasion for 'em.
They undertake even to load Ships entire∣ly
with a kind of Fish, which they catch
in the Rivers with a sort of Harping-Iron;
and this they perform upon such reason∣ble
Terms, that those who follow this
Trade by their Means, always find an ex∣traordinary
Profit in it; because the Vent
of 'em is always speedy and certain in the
Islands, where there is a great Consumption
of 'em made; so that one may say, this sort
of Fish, and the Sea-Tortoise, are the Cod-fish
of the Continent, and the <HI>Antego</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>And 'tis the <HI>Manna,</HI> upon which the
Colonies between the <HI>Tropiques</HI> live, as much
as many of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and some others,
do upon Cod-fish. This Fishing Trade
is practis'd all the Year in most of the Ri∣vers
<PB N="64" REF="183"/>
on this Coast, except the Fishing for
Tortoise, which holds but 3 or 4 Months in
the Year; during which, the Females come
to lay their Eggs in the Sand, beyond the
Marks that are left of the highest Tides, and
that in so great abundance, (especially on
the Shoars that are least frequented) as can
hardly be imagin'd: For 10 Men can turn
as many of 'em in a Night, as 100 can dress
in a Week.</P>
<P>In the Night, which is the only time
they take to lay their Eggs, they wait 'till
they have pass'd the Bounds, which the
highest Tides have mark'd, and then turn
'em upon their Backs, and being once in this
Posture, they can by no means recover them∣selves
upon their Feet to go back into the Sea.</P>
<P>Among the Plants which the <HI>Indians</HI> cul∣tivate
in their Plantations, Cotton is one of
those that principally employs 'em, especi∣ally
the Women who make this their
particular business; and thus find means to
adorn themselves; for they know how to
spin it as fine as can be desir'd. And if the
disorders that have happen'd in the Colo∣nies
upon the Continent, had not hinder'd
the Establishing a Regular Traffick of it,
which might have been easily accomplish'd;
I say, if it had not been for this, all <HI>Europe</HI>
might have been furnish'd with it, in all
manner of ways in which it could have been
<PB N="65" REF="183"/>
imploy'd, without costing the <HI>French</HI> any
more trouble or charge in a manner, than
that of receiving it; because of the natural
and general inclination the <HI>Indians</HI> have
both for Work, and for Finery; esteeming
a grain of Christal to hang about their Neck
or at their Ears, as much as we should do a
Diamond of the same bigness.</P>
<P>Besides, it being well known, that Cot∣ton
is one of those Commodities that are
consum'd the most in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Price
of which is least varied, the Inhabitants of
the Islands would never have left off culti∣vating
it, if there had been Women enough
to spin it, without which it can't be Trans∣ported
but with a great deal of Trouble,
and little Profit.</P>
<P>The Hamocks or Cotton-beds which the
<HI>Indians</HI> sell us for a Bill or Hatchet, are after∣wards
sold in the Islands with considerable
Advantage; every one there having one of
'em, and there are none of them brought from
any other Country than <HI>Guiana,</HI> except from
<HI>Brasil,</HI> and that but rarely, because of the
small Commerce the <HI>French</HI> have there.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Rocou</HI> is a red Die, and valuable
when 'tis natural, such as the <HI>Indians</HI> sell
us, before it has been falsified by For∣reigners,
who carry it into <HI>Europe.</HI> See
<HI>Ʋrucu in Catal. Plant. Jamaic.</HI> P. 150.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="184"/>
There are to be had among 'em likewise
divers sorts of Gumms, Woods, and Roots
proper for Physick, which are good Com∣modities
in <HI>France,</HI> as well as several sorts
of Wood proper for Dying; and for ma∣king
of Cabinets and Inlaid Works, among
which is the Letter-wood, which the <HI>French</HI>
call <HI>Bois de la Chine,</HI> and which grows in no
other place in the World but on this part of
the Continent. The Natives cut it and car∣ry
it in great burthens quite to the Ships so
cheap, that a 1000 weight of it comes to
but a Crown; whereas that quantity was a
long time sold for a 100 Crowns, and ne∣ver
for less than 150 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>Besides those Animals that are fit for
sport; as <HI>Apes</HI> of divers kinds, <HI>Sapajous, Ta∣marins,
Sagovius, Parrots, Arras</HI> and <HI>Tocaus:</HI>
I omit a great many other things, which
this Country produces; and one may say,
this large Compass of Ground has more∣over
this Advantage above the Islands of
<HI>America,</HI> that there is no fear of tiring it;
as we are taught by Experience, the Island
of St. <HI>Christopher,</HI> and others have been in
a little Space of Time, where the Land is
become almost barren, meerly by being o∣ver-burden'd
with continual Crops, because
it can never be suffer'd to rest, by Reason
of the small Portion of Ground that every
Inhabitant possesses; which yet does not
<PB N="67" REF="184"/>
hinder 'em from raising every Year a prodi∣gious
Quantity of Sugar, besides Ginger,
Indigo, Cassia, and other Commodities that
are cultivated and made there.</P>
<P>This Country of <HI>Guiana</HI> is diversified
with Hills, Plains and Meadows; and there
are scarce any Mountains but would turn
to a good Account, if they were manur'd:
The Land is every where so fertile, that one
Man may easily get, with his own Hands,
a Livelihood for Twenty People, the Cul∣tivation
of it is so very easie. The Fruits
of it are excellent, and very plentiful; and
all our sorts of <HI>Corn</HI> grow there all the
Year round, without distinction of Sea∣sons,
and that in a very little time: And
there being no Winter, the Trees are alter∣nately
cover'd with Blossoms and Fruits,
and always with Leaves.</P>
<P>The Air is very good, and the Climate
very Temperate, tho' it be between the
<HI>Tropiques;</HI> for the Heat is continually mi∣tigated
by a fresh East-wind, which blows
all the Year, except in the Night, when
the <HI>Breezes</HI> come from the Land, which
are only felt one or two Leagues toward

of the Ships, that have taken in their
Provision of 'em in this Country. It must
not be omitted, that there are on this Coast
a great many Islands so proper for the Feed∣ing
of Cattle, that provided some necessary
Precautions be observ'd, there is no doubt
but there would in a short time be as great
a Number of 'em produc'd (if a Stock were
carried thither) in proportion, as in the
other Islands, whither Ships go every Day
for Hides; as they do to St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and
elsewhere.</P>

Detail of a Country, where the <HI>French</HI>
have now a Colony, from whence a more
ample Information may be expected.</P>
