<HEAD>TO THE LEARNED Dr. <HI>Martin Lister.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOme ill natured and unthinking Ani∣mals having imbib'd an Opinion that your only Design in publishing your Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> was to flatter the <HI>French</HI> and disparage the <HI>English,</HI> they made, you know, very undecent Reflections upon that Treatise, represented your Worship as a short sighted, prejudiced Observer, and one that had a greater Esteem and Veneration for <HI>Paris</HI> than the famous City of <HI>London:</HI> Which in respect of its healthful and pleasant Situa∣tion, splendid and uniform Buildings, Houses and Shops richly Furnished, wealthy Mer∣chants and Tradesmen, and excellency of its
<PB REF="3"/>Government, is Celebrated as a <HI>Non-Pareil</HI> through the Christian World.</P>
<P>But, Sir, as Ignorance is the Parent of Misunderstanding, so they were unhappily led into this Mistake for want of Brains to comprehend your Method in commending and dispraising. For your Abilities in Hi∣story, like the other parts of your great Learning, lying very deep, and out of the Vulgar Track, it is not discernible to every Pur-blind Eye: Whereas better illuminated Apprehensions easily perceiv'd your Inclina∣tion was to give the Preference for <HI>London</HI> and <HI>English-men;</HI> for when you spake of the <HI>French</HI> City and People, your Elogies were Satyrs, your Panegyricks Lampoons, and you always unluckily brought in something that disparag'd what you seem'd to advance, and clouded all the Glory that was thought you intended them in the publication of your Journey.</P>
<P>'Tis true, you say the <HI>French</HI> Gentry <HI>are ve∣ry Civil and Obliging,</HI> and I believe no less, though you are pleased to say, <HI>They value themselves upon their Courtship, and in making a Leg and Bow better than the rest of Mankind: Building and Dressing mostly for Figure, and that their principal Diversions are only to see and be seen;</HI> and this I think, Sir, your Enemies will allow to be no extraordinary Chara∣cter.</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>You acquaint us, Sir, <HI>That their Houses are richly furnished; for they have generally from five to ten distinct Families under every Roof, that the Inhabitants are wealthy in Pictures,</HI> and have the Curiosity and Ingenuity <HI>to Ruin themselves in that kind of expensive Furniture:</HI> Which would be thought a vanity in others; but this, Doctor, is your peculiar knack in com∣mending their Oeconomy.</P>
<P><HI>The Buildings in</HI> Paris, you say, <HI>are very fine, built with rough Stone, Plaister'd over, and Colour'd to make them look like Brick; but at longest, will not stand above five and twenty Years,</HI> and then they have the pleasure of building new ones, which must needs be a great satisfaction to the Proprietors.</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> in your Opinion, Sir, <HI>is more Popu∣lous than</HI> London, <HI>but it seems 'tis only in ap∣pearance, because the Palaces and Convents have eat up the Peoples Dwellings, and crowded them so excessively together in the Trading parts of the Town, that they seem more numerous than they are; whereas the Artists and Tradesmen in</HI> Lon∣don <HI>and</HI> Westminster <HI>have purchased the No∣blemens Palaces, and converted them into Shops and private Dwellings. The lower Windows in</HI> Paris <HI>are grated with strong Iron Bars before 'em.</HI> But are excelled in that particular also, if you had thought upon't by the two stately Houses over the two <HI>West</HI> Gates of <HI>London.</HI> You say also <HI>That</HI> Paris <HI>is a beautiful and convenient
<PB REF="4"/>City but the Streets are very narrow, extreamly dirty, and the Passengers on foot no way secured from the hurry and danger of Coaches.</HI></P>
<P>Above all, <HI>You say their Gardens are very cu∣rious things,</HI> and well they may be so, for you are pleased to add as a Character of their Gal∣lantry, <HI>That as soon as a</HI> Frenchman <HI>gets any thing by Fortune or Inheritance, he will lay it out upon a Picture, or an Ornament for his Garden: Though many Utensils and Conveniencies of Life are wanting to him which are common in</HI> En∣gland.</P>
<P><HI>Their Food in general,</HI> you say, <HI>Is course Bread and Lettice, but that indifferent Aliment is sup∣ply'd with plenty of Sauce, for you tell us they have abundance of Onions, Leeks, Garlick, Sor∣rel, Shallot, Rocombo's and Mushrooms. Their Hackney-Coaches and Chairs are the most nasty and miserable Voiture [Carriage] that can be, and yet are as dear again as in</HI> London; but that misfortune you say, <HI>is supply'd by a worse,</HI> viz. <HI>The</HI> Vingrette, <HI>which is a Coach with two Wheels, dragg'd by a Man, and push'd be∣hind by a Woman or a Boy, and sometimes by both,</HI> which you truly say <HI>is a wretched business in so magnificent a City.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Their Bishops,</HI> say you, <HI>make the best Figure in the Town in their Equipages and Liveries, but not in respect of their Learning;</HI> for you are pleased to add, <HI>That Learning is not so necessary a Qualification there, as with us in</HI> England.
<PB REF="4"/><HI>Their Churches are numerous, but not big, and very few of them have either Towers or Steeples, though they are the Glory of a Prospect;</HI> but at length, Sir, you are pleased to credit the <HI>French,</HI> and gratifie your Enemies, in saying, <HI>They have more manners and Religion than the</HI> English; for which, some of your Country-men are resolv'd never to forgive you, though I think they justly ought, for the Characters you bestow on their Monks. <HI>Who wear,</HI> say you, <HI>the Rustick Habits of old Times, without Shirts, or other Linnen Orna∣ments of the present Age. That wantonly Perse∣cute themselves to do violence to Christianity. That feed upon sowre Herbs, Fish, and such kind of Trash, and lie worse, always rough and upon Boards; go bare foot in a cold Country; deny themselves the Comforts of this Life, and wear out their days in a slavish and fruitless Devotion.</HI> And this I think may at one for what your Back Friends call an odious Comparison.</P>
<P>Thus far, dear Doctor, I have been your Compurgator, and clear'd you from the su∣spicion of being more a <HI>French-man</HI> than an <HI>English-man,</HI> which might have been prejudi∣cial to your Practice: And now am become an humble Suitor to you, that since a Friend that is gone a long Journey has oblig'd me with a Succinct and Pleasant View of some parts of <HI>France;</HI> and largely Supplies in Words at length, where you mince the Mat∣ter, that you would please to take it into
<PB REF="5"/>your Protection, and give it the Honour of being Bound up as a Supplement with your <HI>Journey to Paris,</HI> and you will much oblige,</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Succinct Description</HI> OF FRANCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE notice of a happy Peace after so tedious a War, tempting our Curi∣osity to take a view of <HI>France,</HI> of which we have had such different Relations; my self, with several other <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣men, embark'd at <HI>Dover</HI> in <HI>May,</HI> the pleasan∣test Month of the Year, with a fair South West Wind, which had it continued in that Point, would soon have wafted us to the <HI>Galick</HI> Shoar; but a little toward Night it veering more about to the West, and the Tide not befriending us, our Passage became tedious and troublesom to such Fresh-water Sailers, and we had leisure to see the swelling Waves, by an inbred Ambition, strive which should be the highest; while our Vessel by
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>a violent agitation of the Wind danc'd a nimble <HI>Galiard</HI> on the Billows; but that which made the generality of the Passengers in a very uneasy condition, and the Deck and Cabins look like so many <HI>Hospitals</HI> fill'd with diseased Persons; made the <HI>Scaly</HI> Inhabitants of that <HI>Watry Kingdom</HI> sport them∣selves on the surface of the Waves, and dance about our Ketch as if she had been a mov∣ing <HI>May-Pole,</HI> and acted their Measures with such a delightful <HI>Decorum,</HI> as if they had been taught to <HI>Caper</HI> by the best of <HI>French</HI> Dancing Masters. The next <HI>Ebb</HI> brought us within sight of the Sea Coast of <HI>Normandy;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Descrip∣tion of</HI> Norman∣dy.</NOTE> a Shoar so evenly composed and levelled, that it looks like the work of <HI>Art,</HI> and not of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>The first Inhabitants of this Country came
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Anno 800.</NOTE> Originally from <HI>Norway,</HI> Soldiers of For∣tune, and so terribly spoil'd the Maritine Coasts of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> that, <HI>A furore Normannorum</HI> was inserted into the <HI>Letany;</HI> but now being Conquer'd by the <HI>French,</HI> and enslaved under that Monar∣chy, they are utterly crest fallen, have lost both their <HI>Courage</HI> and their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and nothing remains among them now of their Progenitors, but a penurious <HI>Pride,</HI> and an ungovernable <HI>Surliness.</HI></P>
<P>The next Tide landed us at <HI>Deipe</HI> in <HI>Nor∣mandy.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Town of</HI> Diepe.</NOTE> A Town seated on an Arm of the Sea, between two Hills, which are a Security to the <HI>Harbour,</HI> and a Strength to the <HI>Town;</HI> but avail'd them little against the <HI>Courage</HI> of the <HI>English,</HI> and the Force of their <HI>Bombs,</HI> whose Injuries they were now Repairing. The
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>number of the Inhabitants were formerly ac∣counted about 30000, whereof 9000 of them were of the <HI>Protestant Religion;</HI> and the Church of <HI>Argues,</HI> a Village about two Miles from <HI>Deipe</HI> was allowed them for the Exercise of their Religion; but since the <HI>Persecution</HI> they are all dispersed, and the want of them greatly Lamented.</P>
<P>Here we were Eye Witnesses of the <HI>Idola∣try</HI> of the <HI>Papists,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popish Ido∣latry.</NOTE> in paying <HI>divine Honour</HI> to things <HI>Inanimate:</HI> We saw the <HI>Hoast</HI> or <HI>Sacrament</HI> carried through the Streets, by a couple of <HI>Priests,</HI> under a <HI>Canopy,</HI> usher'd by two or three <HI>Torches,</HI> and followed by a Com∣pany of <HI>Idle</HI> Boys and old People: Before it, was carried a <HI>Bell</HI> continually <HI>Tinkling,</HI> to warn the People that their <HI>God</HI> was carrying by, and expected their <HI>Reverence,</HI> which was paid by all that met it, by falling on their <HI>Knees,</HI> Raising their <HI>Heads,</HI> and giving it <HI>Honour:</HI> Tho' methinks not with so much Devotion, as I should have done, if I had be∣lieved it, as they do, to be the <HI>Body</HI> of my <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>But I find its the Common practice of this Country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tra∣velling Chariots and Horses.</NOTE> for the <HI>Laity</HI> as well as the <HI>Clergy</HI> to impose upon Mens <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Understandings;</HI> for we designing to Travel towards <HI>Rouen,</HI> and Horses being not to be had for Money, and the <HI>War</HI> between the two Nations, and the Ruins of <HI>Deipe,</HI> were so fresh in their Me∣mories we could not expect them for <HI>Love,</HI> we were forc'd to make use of the common Conveyance, and that was in a <HI>Cart;</HI> but for fear of Offending, forsooth, in spite of our Teeths, tho' we saw it was a <HI>Cart,</HI> we must
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>call it <HI>Une Chariot,</HI> and to please them so we did, tho' we thought it fit for no <HI>Tri∣umph,</HI> but that of a <HI>French-man.</HI> To this <HI>Cart</HI> (Chariot I mean) were fastened three things, that had been <HI>Horses</HI> in their time, but were now skelitoniz'd into Carcases, or Images of Horses, without life or motion. When we were mounted they began to Crawl, for go they could not, however it convinc'd me they had life, tho' I thought it would hold out no longer, than to carry them to the next Pack of Hounds. Thus ac∣commodated <HI>A la mode de France,</HI> we took our leaves of <HI>Deipe,</HI> and wagg'd so slowly towards <HI>Roven,</HI> that we thought our Journey was a perfect Emblem of the motion of the <HI>Ninth Sphere,</HI> which was Forty Nine Thousand Years in finishing; but this was not all our Calami∣ty; the <HI>Rain</HI> fell on us through our <HI>Tilt,</HI> which for the many Holes in it, might more truly have been call'd a <HI>Net.</HI> The <HI>Dirt</HI> broke plenti∣fully upon us, through the <HI>Rails</HI> of our <HI>Chariot,</HI> and the unproportionable pace of it, started al∣most every <HI>Bone</HI> of our Bodies. I wonder how a <HI>French-man,</HI> that commonly carries the <HI>Disease</HI> of his Country about him, durst ad∣venture his crasy Carcass in it. Thus we endu∣red all the infelicities of a Journey, and escaped three several <HI>Deaths,</HI> Drowning, Choaking with Mire, and Breaking of the Wheel; besides the fear of being <HI>Famish'd</HI> before we came to our <HI>Inn,</HI> which was six <HI>French</HI> Miles from us.</P>
<P>Not to mention the <HI>Beggarly</HI> Villages we dragled through,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Town and the Inn at</HI> Tostes.</NOTE> we came at last to <HI>Tostes,</HI> the place destin'd for our Lodging; a Town like the <HI>Worser</HI> sort of our Market Towns in
<PB N="5" REF="7"/><HI>England.</HI> There our <HI>Chariotier</HI> brought us to the <HI>Ruins</HI> of a House, an <HI>Alehouse</HI> I would scarce have thought it, but in complement to the Nation, it must be cald an <HI>Inn;</HI> yes, and an Honourable one too, as <HI>Don Quixots</HI> Host told him. Despair of finding in this <HI>Nasty hole,</HI> either Bedding or Victuals, I was in the Mans mind that chose <HI>Hanging,</HI> rather than Marry a foul Queen that Beg'd him; and was often ready to say, <HI>Drive on Carman.</HI> The truth on't is, I fell out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire.</P>
<P>A Course Fac'd <HI>Tatterdemalion</HI> belonging to the House,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cham∣ber.</NOTE> brought us into a Room as <HI>Dark</HI> and as <HI>Damp</HI> as a <HI>Charnel-House;</HI> only toward the <HI>Orchard</HI> there was a Melancholy kind of a <HI>Hole,</HI> which in Days of <HI>Yore,</HI> had been a <HI>Window,</HI> but now both Frame and Glass were vanish'd: However by the <HI>Light</HI> that came in, I could easily perceive I was not in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the Chamber were three Beds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bedds and Sheets.</NOTE> if it be Lawful to call them so, that were bottom'd with <HI>Straw,</HI> so closely squeez'd together, that the <HI>Wool-Packs,</HI> in the House of <HI>Lords,</HI> in respect of these were <HI>Swans-Down.</HI> On this Straw <HI>Huddle</HI> lay a Medly of <HI>Flocks</HI> and <HI>Feathers,</HI> sewed up in an <HI>English</HI> cast <HI>Hop-Sack▪</HI> so ill ordered, that they stuck up like the <HI>Knobbs</HI> of a Crab-Tree <HI>Cudgel,</HI> and we were obliged to our <HI>Flesh,</HI> that one Nights Lodg∣ing did not wear our <HI>Bones</HI> out. The <HI>Sheets</HI> they brought us, were so <HI>Course,</HI> that in my Conscience, a Sailer would have refused them for a <HI>Hammock,</HI> and I heartily wish'd I could have exchang'd them for an <HI>English Horse-Cloath;</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>the <HI>Coverlid</HI> so course and Bare, that if a Man would have undertaken to have counted the <HI>Threds,</HI> he need not have miss'd <HI>One</HI> of the Number.</P>
<P>The <HI>Table Linnen</HI> was of the same Com∣plexion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Table Linnen.</NOTE> so <HI>Foul</HI> and <HI>Dirty,</HI> that I could not think it had been wash'd above once, since it grew in the Hemp ground, and yet the poor things had as brisk a <HI>French</HI> Air, as if they had been promised for the next whole Year, to escape a <HI>Scouring.</HI> By this Description of an <HI>Inn,</HI> you may guess Sir, at all the rest in <HI>France.</HI> Some are not altogether so wretch∣ed, yet the alteration is almost insensible.</P>
<P>Let us now walk into the <HI>Kitchin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kitch∣ing and Provision for Supper.</NOTE> and see what's for <HI>Supper,</HI> and here, Sir, we found a most terrible <HI>Execution,</HI> committed upon the body of a Pullet. Our <HI>Hostess,</HI> cruel Woman as she was, had cut the Throat of it, and without plucking off the <HI>Feathers,</HI> tore it into pieces, and then took off the <HI>Skin</HI> and <HI>Feathers</HI> together, as we strip <HI>Rabbets</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> clapt it into a <HI>Pan,</HI> and <HI>Fricasized</HI> it into a <HI>Supper.</HI></P>
<P>After which Repast we had a Sight of our <HI>Hostess,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Hostes and her Daughter.</NOTE> and her <HI>Daughter,</HI> at which we blest our Souls, and march off, lest the fulsom in∣terview should have brought up what we had eaten; for such a couple of <HI>dirty Queans</HI> was never seen in <HI>England,</HI> unless in a <HI>Dust Cart,</HI> or among the Gold Finders at Mid∣night. <HI>Horace</HI>'s Salutation, <HI>O mater pulchra filia pulchrior,</HI> was never so seasonable as here. Not to honour them with a fairer Character let this suffice, that their <HI>Persons</HI> kept so per∣fect a Decorum with the <HI>House</HI> and <HI>Furniture,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>that 'tis pitty they should be parted. But this is not the luck of the Women of <HI>Nor∣mandy</HI> only, for through all <HI>France</HI> their <HI>Faces</HI> and their <HI>Linnen</HI> are the best Guards of their <HI>Chastity:</HI> They are all forc'd to be contented with a very little <HI>Beauty,</HI> and she which with us would be slighted as an <HI>Antidote,</HI> or a meer dirty <HI>Doudy,</HI> would pass with them for a <HI>Beautiful Princess;</HI> but more of the Women when we come to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>In their Habits the <HI>Normand</HI> Women dif∣fer from the rest of <HI>France.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Womens Habits in</HI> Norman∣dy.</NOTE> The Attire of their Heads, hangs down their Backs like a Vail, and looks like a Superannuated <HI>Dish-Clout,</HI> turn'd out of Service, or the corner of a <HI>Table Cloath,</HI> that never had been wash'd. Being ready to leave our Quarters in the Mor∣ning, we found our selves in a throng of <HI>Ill Faces,</HI> all Whining out <HI>Pour les Servantes,</HI> and our bounty was like giving a <HI>Dole,</HI> at a Rich Mans Funeral, you could not say when you had done giving, there were so many of them; and herein only was our Advantage, that their Ambition reaches no higher than a <HI>Sou a penny,</HI> and he that gives more over∣bids their <HI>Expectation,</HI> and shall be counted a <HI>Prodigal.</HI></P>
<P>But of all the <HI>Gallantries of France,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Men Servants.</NOTE> com∣mend me to the <HI>Men-Servants</HI> in their <HI>Inns,</HI> the Raggedst regiment that ever Eyes beheld, their cloths full of Patches, or open to their Skins, and by the habits of the <HI>Attendants,</HI> a man would be tempted to think he had been lodg'd in a <HI>Goal.</HI> Bid one of them give you a <HI>Cloth</HI> to wipe your hands, and he will reach you the <HI>Curtain</HI> of the <HI>Bed:</HI> Bid him wipe
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>the <HI>Table,</HI> or your <HI>Bootes,</HI> he has still recourse to the <HI>Curtains,</HI> and they perform all their Offices, with their <HI>Hats</HI> on their <HI>Heads</HI> to which <HI>French Custom</HI> I profess my self an open <HI>Enemy;</HI> for tho' <HI>Jack</HI> speaks French, I can∣not allow <HI>Jack</HI> to be a <HI>Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Now we set out for <HI>Rouen:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rouen <HI>de∣scribed.</HI></NOTE> The whole journey was <HI>six</HI> French Miles, and our <HI>Cart</HI> was Ten hours in dragging us thither: Excellent speed; and would have wore out the patience of the <HI>Mad Duke,</HI> that undertook without. <HI>Staff, Whip,</HI> or <HI>Goad,</HI> to drive two <HI>Snails</HI> from <HI>Milan</HI> to <HI>Mosco.. Roven</HI>is scituate in a plea∣sant Valley on the River <HI>Sein;</HI> the Houses are high, in some places Wood, in others Stone, and some of both, without uniformity or or Beauty. What remains of the Bridge is a fine piece of Work, and the River is about the breadth of the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Fulham.</HI> Be∣tween the Town-Wall, and the River is their <HI>Exchange,</HI> a place paved with smooth Pebble-stones about a hundred yards long, in breadth twenty, and is a fine walk in <HI>Fair-Weather,</HI> and in <HI>Wet,</HI> you must seek another.</P>
<P>In this Town are Thirty two Parish Chur∣ches, besides Abbies, and Religious houses, of which the most beautiful is that of <HI>St. And Ooven,</HI> the Seat and Church of the Arch Bishop is <HI>Nostre Dame,</HI> more gorgeous on the out side, than Beautiful or <HI>Rich</HI> with∣in. Behind the High Altar is the Remains of the <HI>Duke of Bedford's</HI> Tomb, sometimes Regent of <HI>France,</HI> which was Defaced out of pure spight to his memory long since his Death, that made all <HI>France</HI> tremble when he was alive. East ward of this Church is

<P>This brings me to speak of the <HI>French Wo∣men,</HI>

<P>You cannot collect a better Character of a <HI>French-woman,</HI>

<P>There is a great bussle among ancient Au∣thors,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paris <HI>its Names and Scituation.</HI></NOTE> from whence this name <HI>Paris</HI> is deriv'd, which I shall not waste time about, for I find the names of great <HI>Cities</HI> are as obscure as those of their <HI>Founders,</HI> and the Conjectural Deri∣vations of them are sometimes rather <HI>plausible</HI> than <HI>probable,</HI> and sometimes neither. The other name of this City is most <HI>Ancient,</HI> and most proper, as taken from its <HI>Scituation,</HI> and call'd <HI>Lutetia,</HI> from <HI>Lutum,</HI> Dirt, as being seated in an exceeding <HI>clammy, dirty</HI> Soil, but in a very Fruitful Country, and the River <HI>Seine,</HI> by Transporting Merchants Goods in <HI>Boats</HI> from the <HI>Ships,</HI> which lie fifteen Miles distant from the City, does much enrich it.</P>

<P>It is in Compass about <HI>ten Miles,</HI> or scarce so much, <HI>Circular</HI> in its figure, and is a fair and goodly City, yet nothing like the <HI>mira∣cle</HI> that some would make it; for was the <HI>fi∣gure</HI> of <HI>London</HI> altered, and all the Houses cast into a <HI>Ring,</HI> as it is a much <HI>Sweeter,</HI> so it would be a more <HI>Magnificent</HI> and better City than that of <HI>Paris.</HI> It lies Commodiously in a Plain, flat and level, where are no Hills to annoy it, and therefore might be made impregnable.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Govern∣ment of</HI> Paris.</NOTE> or Town of <HI>Paris,</HI> are <HI>Thir∣teen</HI> Parish Churches, <HI>Seven</HI> Gates, and is Govern'd by two <HI>Provosts.</HI> The <HI>Provost de Paris,</HI> and <HI>le Provost des Merchands,</HI> and the place of Judicature is the <HI>Grand Castolet,</HI> and <HI>l' Hostelle de Ville.</HI> The Provost of <HI>Paris</HI> has to his Assistance three <HI>Lieutenants,</HI> the <HI>Criminal,</HI> the <HI>Civil,</HI> and the <HI>Particuleir,</HI> which supplies in the absence of the other; besides other Officers more than a good many. The <HI>Pro∣vost</HI> of the Merchands, whose business is to preserve the Privileges of the Citizens, is assi∣sted by the two <HI>Eschevins,</HI> as Sheriffs, twenty four Counsellors, and a Procurator, like the Common-Council and Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> whose Habits are half Red, and half Sky-Colour'd. This Provost is generally belov'd by the Citizens, as the Conservator of their Liberties, and the others fear'd and hated, as

<P>In this <HI>Ville</HI> is also the Kings Arsenal,

<P>The University of <HI>Paris</HI> is seated on the fur∣thermost Branch of the <HI>Seine,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Uni∣versity.</NOTE> is little inferiour to the <HI>Ville</HI> in bigness, but all its Learning is not able to free it from the <HI>Noisomness</HI> of the other. It has but six Parish Churches, and eight Gates, but many <HI>Religious</HI> Houses. It was Founded by <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> Anno 792. at the perswasion of <HI>Alivine</HI> an <HI>Oxford man,</HI> Scholar of Venerable <HI>Bede,</HI> who brought with him <HI>Rabanus Maurus, John Duns,</HI> Sir∣named <HI>Scotus,</HI> and <HI>Claudus,</HI> who was also cal∣led <HI>Clement,</HI> three of his Con-disciples, who were the first <HI>Readers</HI> there, and to these four does the University of <HI>Paris</HI> owe its Original and first Rudiments of Learning. Nor was this the first time that <HI>England</HI> was the <HI>School∣master</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> for we lent them not only their first <HI>Doctors in Divinity</HI> and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> but from us also did they receive the Myste∣ries
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>of their Religion, when they were <HI>Heathens,</HI> as you may read in <HI>Julius Caesar Com.</HI> 6. which is an unquestionable Authori∣ty, and it had been well for them if they had writ after the same Copy to this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Colleges</HI> they had none,

This good Example invited <HI>French</HI> Kings and Subjects to erect more, till they had increased the number to fifty two Col∣leges, which it still enjoyeth, tho' the odd forty are little serviceable to Learning, for in twelve of them only, is there any publick Reading, either in Divinity or Philosophy. Every College has its <HI>Rector,</HI> but his Mainte∣nance is very scanty, arising only out of Chamber-Rents, like the <HI>Principal</HI> of a Hall in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and the Building of the Colleges are as mean as their Revenues are poor, and indeed all <HI>France</HI> labours under the want of Encouragements to Learning.</P>
<P>The College of <HI>Sorbonne</HI> is the Glory of this University,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Sor∣bonne.</NOTE> built by <HI>Robert de Sorbonne</HI> of the Chamber of <HI>Lewis</HI> IX. None can be ad∣mitted into this College but Divines, nor none under the Degree of Doctors. Their number is about Seventy, their Allowance is a Pint of Wine, (which is almost our Quart) and a Quantity of Bread daily. Meat they have none allow'd them, unless they pay for it. These Doctors confer Degrees, and in their several turns read six times a day, three in the Forenoon, and as many in the Afternoon. Three Doctors with the Parlia∣ment
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>of <HI>Paris,</HI> are the Pillars of the <HI>French</HI> Liberties, and indeed are very jealous of the least Circumstances in which the Privileges of their Nation might be endanger'd, and on all occasions will shew they disapprove what they can't remedy. This University is Governed by a <HI>Rector,</HI> a <HI>Vice-Chancellor,</HI> four <HI>Proctors,</HI> as many <HI>Intranta,</HI> and the <HI>Regent</HI> Masters.</P>

The King having summon'd an As∣sembly of twenty five Bishops to consult a∣bout Church Affairs, they chose the College of <HI>Sorbonne</HI> for their Senate-house, and the Doctor that was to Preach before them be∣ginning his Oration with <HI>Reverendissimi Rector &amp; vos Amplissimi Praesules,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Rouen</HI> interrupted him, and commanded him to invert his Style, which he no sooner obey'd, but the Rector presently rises up with <HI>Impono tibi silentium,</HI> which is an Injunction within the compass of his Power. Upon this, the Preacher being Tongue ty'd, the Contro∣versy grew hot between the <HI>Bishops</HI> and the <HI>Rector,</HI> both Parties eagerly contending for Priority, till a Cardinal, wiser than the rest, desired the Question might be laid aside for that time, and that the <HI>Rector</HI> would permit the <HI>Doctor</HI> to deliver his <HI>Sermon</HI> without a <HI>Prae∣ludium.</HI> To which the <HI>Rector</HI> consented, and the Dispute for that time was ended.</P>

The Fable of the Mountain which was with Child, and brought forth a <HI>Mouse,</HI> is questionless a Fable, and this House, and the Fame it has acquir'd in the World, is the
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral</HI> of it;
for if you carefully examine it in parts, it will appear so disagreeable to it self, and the Rules of Art, that the whole does not merit the Character that is given it. The Draw-Bridges, and the three <HI>Gates,</HI> are unsightly at your entrance. In the <HI>Quadran∣gle</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="22"/>are several Fashions of Buildings of three or four Ages ago, and as <HI>Inartificially</HI> and <HI>Immethodically</HI> joyn'd, as if they had been jumbled together by an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> The South and West parts, the Work of <HI>Francis</HI> I. and his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> are Prince like, and when the rest of the House is cast in the same Mould, it may deserve the Character of a stately Pile of Building. The Inside is worse than the Outside, and so cluster'd with many little Rooms, that it looks more like a <HI>Tavern</HI> than a <HI>King's Palace,</HI> especially when you consi∣der, tho' the Chambers are well built, they are but very indifferently furnish'd.</P>
<P>The first of the two <HI>Galleries</HI> is curiously adorn'd with Pictures of the Kings and Queens of <HI>France,</HI> the Tables all of a just length,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fine Gallery:</NOTE> in∣comparably Painted, and contain a perfect History of the State and Court of <HI>France</HI> in their several Successions; for under each of their Kings Pictures are those of the Lords who had Signaliz'd themselves in Honourable Actions. And under each of the Queens the lively Pourtraitures of the Principal Ladies who had honour'd the Court with their Beau∣ty and Virtue. A witty Invention, and as happily express'd by the Artists.</P>
<P>The <HI>Long Gallery</HI> is about five hundred Yards in length,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The long Gallery.</NOTE> and of breadth and heighth not unproportionable. A Room built rather for <HI>Ostentation</HI> than <HI>Use,</HI> and has more in it of the Majesty than the Grace of its Founder.</P>
<P>The principal Beauty, (if I might judge) of the <HI>Louvre,</HI> is <HI>la Salle des Antiques,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hall of Antiqui∣ties.</NOTE> the Hall of <HI>Antiquities,</HI> a low, plain Room pav'd with Brick. without any Hangings, and yet
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>in my mind, the best furnish'd of all I saw in <HI>France.</HI> It has five of the most Ancient and Venerable Pieces of all the Kingdom; but herein I shall be thought a mean and un∣fashionable Soul by the <HI>Monsieurs,</HI> who are re∣gardless of Antiquity, both in the Monu∣ments, and in the Study of it, and are all for new things, especially Cloths, as oft as they can get them. The five Pieces above nam'd, are the Statue of <HI>Diana,</HI> which was Wor∣shipped in the Renown'd Temple of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> of a large and manly proportion, all naked but her Feet, and what Modesty commands to be cover'd. Another was the Statue of one of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Gods, as black as his People. Next to that grim Deity, was the Effigies of <HI>Mercury,</HI> with a Pipe in his Mouth, and all naked but his Feet. The fourth was the Pourtraiture of <HI>Venus</HI> quite naked, in her hand her little Son <HI>Cupid</HI> sitting on a <HI>Dolphin:</HI> And last of all, <HI>Apollo</HI> in the same naked Po∣sture, except that contrary to the Mode of <HI>France</HI> he had Shooes on, but whether they were made of <HI>Leather</HI> or <HI>Wood,</HI> I am not able to determine. All these are said to be given to the King of <HI>France</HI> by his Holyness of <HI>Rome.</HI> A pleasant exchange for the Pope to give him the Gods of the Heathens, who had given himself to the Idols of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and I believe upon the same Terms the now King of <HI>England</HI> might have all the Relicks and Ruins of Antiquity in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from this Room,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The House of</HI> Bour∣bonne <HI>and the</HI> Tuil∣leries.</NOTE> on the other side of the <HI>Louvre,</HI> is the House of <HI>Bourbon.</HI> On the <HI>Tuilleries.</HI> I have nothing to say, but that they were built by <HI>Catharine</HI> of <HI>Medices, Anno</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>1564. and took name from the <HI>Lime-Kilns</HI> and <HI>Tile-pits</HI> there, before the Foundation of the fine House and Gardens.</P>
<P>The present King of <HI>France</HI> is the Son of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. by the Lady <HI>Anna,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King.</NOTE> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> at whose Marriage, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> un∣willing to fall under the <HI>French</HI> Obedience, which might very well happen, she being the eldest Sister of the King, they inserted a Clause in the seventh Article of Marriage, That neither the said <HI>Infanta,</HI> nor the Chil∣dren born by her to the King, should be capa∣ble of Inheriting any of the Estates of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and in the eighth Article, (be∣ing Marry'd at eleven Years of Age) she is bound to make an Act of Renunciation under her own Hand Writing as soon as she came to be twelve Years old, which was accord∣ingly perform'd. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. now Reigning, was born <HI>Aug.</HI> 26. 1638. succeeded his Fa∣ther in 1643. was Crown'd by the Archbi∣shop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> June 7th 1654. and Marry'd <HI>Maria Theresia,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Philip</HI> IV.

<P>Having wearied our selves with the sight of <HI>Paris,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Madrid.</NOTE> we went to see some of His Majesty's Houses in the Country; and here we passed by. <HI>Madrid,</HI> so call'd from the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Palace at <HI>Madrid,</HI> after the Form of which it is built. The Founder was <HI>Francis</HI> I. A well contriv'd House it seem'd to be, but our Jour∣ney lay beyond it.</P>
<P>A League further is <HI>Rual,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rual.</NOTE> a little Town be∣longing to the <HI>Abby</HI> of St. <HI>Denys,</HI> in which is a pleasant Summer-house, adorn'd with a∣bundance of retir'd Walks, and a curious variety of Water-works; for besides the Forms of divers Glasses, Pillars, and Geo∣metrical Figures, all form'd by the Water, there were Birds of sundry sorts, so Artifi∣cially contriv'd, that they both deceiv'd the Eye by their Motion, and the Ear by their Melody. Somewhat higher, in the midst of a pleasant Garden, are two Fountains of ad∣mirable Workmanship. In the first is the I∣mage of <HI>Cerberus,</HI> the <HI>Boar</HI> of <HI>Calidon,</HI> the <HI>Nemaean Lyon,</HI> and in the Navel of it, <HI>Hercules</HI> killing <HI>Hydra.</HI> In the other only a <HI>Crocodile</HI> full of wild and unruly Tricks, sending from his Throat a Musick not much differing from that of Organs, and had your Eyes been shut, you would have thought your self in a Ca∣thedral Church; for the Melody of the <HI>Cro∣codile</HI> and the <HI>Birds,</HI> exactly counterfeited the Harmony of a well order'd <HI>Quire.</HI> And now we are come into the Grove, a place so sweet∣ly contriv'd, that it would even entice a Man to Melancholy, because in them Melancho∣ly would be delightful. The Trees so inter∣changeably folded, that they were at once a
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>shelter against Wind and Sun, yet not so sul∣lenly closed, but that they afforded the Eye a Prospect over the Vines and the Verdures of the Earth that were imprison'd within them. It seem'd a Grove, an Orchard, and a Vine∣yard, so variously interwoven, as if the Artist had design'd to make one fall in love with Confusion. In the middle of the Wilderness is the House, environ'd with a Moat of Run∣ning-water; the House pretty, and therefore little, built rather for a Banquet than a Feast. It was built and thus enrich'd by M. <HI>de Ponte,</HI> the King's <HI>Taylor,</HI> and was without question, the finest Garment he ever cut out in his life. Dying, he gave it to Mr. <HI>Landerbon,</HI> and the Queen Mother taking a liking to it, bought it, giving in exchange, an Office in the <HI>Trea∣sury</HI> worth 400000 Crowns to be sold.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Rual,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Ger∣main en Lay.</NOTE> is the King's House of St. <HI>Germain en Lay,</HI> where the late King <HI>James</HI> now Resideth, seated on the top of an Hill like <HI>Windsor,</HI> with the Town of St. <HI>Germain</HI> lying about it, and the River <HI>Seine,</HI> like the <HI>Thames,</HI> running below it. This Royal Seat is divided into two parts, the Old and the New, and the whole composes a Ma∣jestical Palace. The <HI>Louvre</HI> so much fam'd, is not to be nam'd the same Day with this, in respect of the Spaciousness of the Rooms, and the Curiosity of the <HI>Paintings,</HI> and other <HI>Ra∣rities.</HI></P>
<P>In a stately large Walk vaulted over head,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Water-Works.</NOTE> are the <HI>Water-works,</HI> and the first thing you encounter, is the Effigies of a Dragon, just against the entrance, which vomits upon all that come nigh him. At the end towards the
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>right hand is the Statue of a <HI>Nymph</HI> sitting before a pair of Organs. Upon loosing one of the Pipes, the Nymph began to singer the Keys, and made excellent Musick. Unto the Division run by her Fingers, her Head kept time, jolting from one Shoulder to the other, like an Old <HI>Fidler</HI> at a Country <HI>Wake.</HI> At the other end toward the left hand we saw a Shop of <HI>Smiths,</HI> another of <HI>Joiners,</HI> and the Backsides full of <HI>Sawyers</HI> and <HI>Masons</HI> all idle; but upon a motion of the Water they all fell to work, and ply'd it lustily. The Birds every where by their singing, saving the <HI>Artificers</HI> the labour of whistling; besides, upon the drawing a Wooden Curtain appear'd two <HI>Tritons</HI> riding on their <HI>Dolphins,</HI> with each of them a Shell in his Hand, which interchange∣ably serv'd for Trumpets. Afterwards follow'd <HI>Neptune</HI> sitting in his Chariot, drawn with four <HI>Tortoises,</HI> grasping his <HI>Tricuspis,</HI> or threefold Scepter in his hand, the Water un∣der them representing all the while the Sea somewhat troubled. Thirty six steps from the Front of the Mansion-House we descended into this Water-house, and by sixty more we descended into a second of the same fashi∣on, but not so long as the other. At the right hand of this, is the whole Story of <HI>Perseus</HI> and <HI>Andromeda,</HI> and the whole acted very lively, the Whale being kill'd, and the Lady loos'd from the Rock; but withal was so cunning∣ly manag'd, and with such mutual change of Fortune between the Combatants, that one that had not known the Fable, would have been sore afraid, that the Knight would have lost the Victory, and the Lady either her
<PB N="41" REF="25"/><HI>Life</HI> or <HI>Honour.</HI> At the other end of the House was shewed us</P>
<P><HI>Orpheus in silvis positus, silvaeque sequentes.</HI> the resemblance of <HI>Orpheus</HI> playing on a <HI>Vio∣lin,</HI> the <HI>Trees</HI> moving, and the <HI>Wild Beasts</HI> Dancing in two <HI>Rings</HI> about him; an Inven∣tion that could not but cost King <HI>Henry</HI> great Summs of money, fince 'tis reported that the breaking of one <HI>Fiddle-String</HI> cost <HI>King Lewis,</HI> his Son, fifteen hundred <HI>Livres.</HI> Another Door opening, we saw divers Representations and Conceits, which would have been more <HI>Graceful,</HI> if they had not had so much of the <HI>Puppet-Play</HI> and <HI>Punchanello</HI> in them. By thir∣ty Steps more we descended into the <HI>Garden,</HI> and by as many more into a <HI>Green,</HI> where was the Statue of a <HI>Horse</HI> in <HI>Brass,</HI> of that <HI>Bigness</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> that he is scarce to be march'd in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side of <HI>Paris</HI> up the River,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Vin∣cent<HI>'s.</HI></NOTE> we saw another of the <HI>King</HI>'s Houses call'd St. <HI>Vin∣cenas,</HI> beautified with a large <HI>Park</HI> well stock'd with <HI>Deer.</HI> In this House died <HI>Philip the Fair, Lewis Hutin,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Fair;</HI> but none so much to be lamented, as that of our Illu∣strious <HI>Henry the Fifth,</HI> cut down in the <HI>flower</HI> of his <HI>Age,</HI> and in the midst of his <HI>Victories.</HI> A Prince truly <HI>Brave, Wise</HI> and <HI>Valiant,</HI> and the <HI>Alexander</HI> of his Time, whose remem∣brance return'd us sorrowful into <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Here we rested a while,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A</HI> French <HI>Servant.</HI></NOTE> and being desirous to entertain a <HI>French Servant,</HI> we had soon our choice of many, but generally such <HI>Grim</HI> and familiar <HI>Scabs,</HI> that <HI>nauseated</HI> an English <HI>Eye;</HI> but at length so many making Addres∣ses to us, for fear the Government should
<PB N="42" REF="26"/>think we were Listing a Regiment, we pitch∣ed upon one that lookt the Modestest of all the Fry, and enquiring into his Qualifications, he told us with a brisk <HI>French</HI> Air, that he was <HI>Un Maistre de Fence, Un Maistre de Dance,</HI> and Squire of the <HI>Toilet,</HI> but seeing by our Countenances we were nei∣ther Fighters, Fops, nor Dancers, he told us in Broken <HI>English,</HI> he could do any thing be∣longing to an accomplish'd <HI>French</HI> Serviteur. He could <HI>Drive de Caroch, or Squire de Lady, Dress de Horse, make de Pottage, or Cook de Fricasy, Ride de Menage Cheval, Mend de Breech, Foot de Stocking, Shave de Beard, or make Clean de Shooe after the best and newest Fashion A le Cour;</HI> and under this Character we took him.</P>
<P>Having now seen the King's Court,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Clergy of</HI> France.</NOTE> of which you may expect a more particular Ac∣count in my next Packet, or when we shall meet in happy <HI>England,</HI> suffer me here then to skip over that and give you a short, but true Account of their Clergy, and of their Church Revenues, which must needs be un∣accountable, since it maintains so great a num∣ber of Idle, Ignorant Mass Mumblers; for not reckoning the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> which shall have a Line by themselves, which are none of the poorest, and daily encrease like <HI>Locusts</HI> and <HI>Caterpillars,</HI> nor any of the Clergy in their New Con∣quests, there are numbred in <HI>France</HI> twelve Archbishopricks, an hundred and four Bi∣shopricks, five hundred and forty Arch-Prio∣ries, one thousand four hundred and fifty Abbies, twelve thousand three hundred and twenty Priories, sixty seven Nunneries, seven hundred Convents of Fryars, two hundred
<PB N="43" REF="26"/>fifty nine Commendams of the Order of <HI>Malta,</HI> and one hundred and thirty thousand Parish Priests, besides Lay Officers and Atten∣dants upon all the several Orders.</P>
<P>To maintain this large Wilderness of Men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Main∣tenance.</NOTE> the Statesmen of <HI>France,</HI> who have propor∣tioned the Country, do allow to the Cler∣gy a fourth part of the whole; for supposing that <HI>France</HI> contains two hundred Millions of Arpins (a measure somewhat larger than our Acre) they have allotted to the Church for its Temporal Revenue forty seven Millions of them. A pretty Competency. To give you a taste for the whole. The Archbishoprick of <HI>Aux</HI> in <HI>Gascoin,</HI> is valued at forty thousand Pound <HI>English communibus Annis.</HI> The Bishop∣rick of <HI>Alby</HI> in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> is reckon'd at fif∣teen thousand Pounds Annually. The Abbot of <HI>Cluniac,</HI> in the Dutchy of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> is valued at fifty thousand Crowns yearly, and the Pa∣rish Priest of <HI>Estiennes,</HI> St. <HI>Steven</HI>'s in <HI>Paris,</HI> re∣ceives Yearly no fewer than 8000 Crowns.</P>
<P>As for the Vulgar Clergy, they have but little Tythe, and less Glebe,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inferi∣or Clergy.</NOTE> most part of that Revenue being appropriated to Abbies and other Religious Houses, and they live only upon the <HI>Baisemens,</HI> the Church Offerings of the People, at Marriages, Christenings, Burials, Dirges, Indulgences, and the like, which is thought to amount to as much as the Temporal Estate of the Church, and would maintain them well, if it were not for the greatness of their number; for generalty every Parish has no fewer than four Priests, which are too many to be Rich, and there is little hopes of their Rising, while they see the best of their Church
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>Preferments given away before their Faces to Boys and Children, which disheartens them in their Studies, and exposes them to De∣bauchery and scandalous Courses.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding their Wings are thus clipt,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mo∣rals.</NOTE> and that Shame and Fear does somewhat Reform them; yet they will often give Na∣ture a Fillip, and allow themselves in some good Fellowship, and to say truth, I think them the best Companions in <HI>France</HI> on a Journey, but not for an Acquaintance. They live very merrily, and keep a better Table than consists with their Vow, and yet far short of their former Affluency when Church Prefer∣ments in <HI>France</HI> were only at the Pope's dispo∣sal, tho' much Ease and very little Study, keeps them still plump, and in good liking. I once Travel'd with three of these mortified Sinners, two <HI>Augustins,</HI> and one <HI>Franciscan,</HI> the merriest Crickets that ever chirped. When we came to a Vein of good Wine, they would cheer up themselves and their Neigh∣bours, with <HI>Vivamus ut bibamus, &amp; bibamus ut vivamus,</HI> and would Toy with the Wenches like young Kitlings, with their Tails or a Feather.</P>
<P>The Common-Priests of <HI>France</HI> are as Dull and Blockish as flitting Beetles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Learning.</NOTE> and for Learn∣ing, can truly say with <HI>Secrates, Hoc tantum Scimus, quod nescimus,</HI> we only know this that we know nothing which their Superiors know, and therefore in the last <HI>Roman Missal,</HI> every Syllable is diversly mark'd, whether the Word must be pronounc'd long or short. When I had lost my self in the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> and wanted <HI>French</HI> to enquire my way to my
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>Lodging, I would apply my self to some of this Reverend Garb; but you might as soon expect Sence from the next Mule, as a word of Latin from any of them; nor is this the Disease of the Vulgar Mass Mumblers only, it has also infected the Right Worshipful of the Clergy.</P>
<P>In <HI>Orleans</HI> I had business with a <HI>Canon</HI> of St. <HI>Croix,</HI> a Dignitary that wore a Lawn Sur∣plice laced with great <HI>Decorum,</HI> and for the comeliness and capacity of his Cap, he might have been a Metropolitan, perceiving me to speak to him in a strange Tongue, (for it was Latin) he very Learnedly ask'd me <HI>Num po∣testis loqui Gallica.</HI> I answering, <HI>No;</HI> he burst out into another Interrogatory, <HI>viz. Quam diu fuistis in Gallice.</HI> To conclude Sir, having read over my Letter with two or three deadly Pangs, and six times rubbing his Tem∣ples, he dismissed me with this comfortable Saying, <HI>Ego negotias vestras curabo;</HI> a strange Beast in a Biggin, and one of the greatest Prodigies of Ignorance, that ever I met with∣all in Mans Apparel.</P>
<P>Now,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our Journey towards</HI> Orleans.</NOTE> being almost choak'd with the noi∣somness of <HI>Paris,</HI> we took our Journey to∣wards <HI>Orleans.</HI> The Day was fair, and not so much as dispos'd to a Cloud, save that a∣bout Noon they began to spread like a Cur∣tain, to defend us from the Injury of the Sun, and the Wind rather sufficient to fan the Air than disturb it. You would have thought it, Sir, a Day meerly fram'd for that great Princess <HI>Nature</HI> to take her pleasure in, and that the Birds which cheerfully gave us their Voices from the neighbouring Bushes,
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>had been the Musick of her Court; in a word, it was a Day solely consecrated to a pleasant Journy, and he that did not put it to that use mis-spent it.</P>
<P>Having cram'd our selves into our Wag∣gon, we took a short farewel of <HI>Paris,</HI> joy∣ful that we liv'd to see the beauty of the Fields again, and to enjoy the happiness of a free and clear Heaven. The Country is like the Isle of <HI>France</HI> towards <HI>Normandy,</HI> only the Corn-fields were more large and even. On our left hand we had a side Glance of the Royal House at <HI>Boys,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Bifectre.</HI></P>
<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Paris</HI> is the Town of <HI>Mont l' Herrie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mont l' Herrie.</NOTE> wherein was nothing obser∣vable but the Carcass of a Castle, and a Plain about it, where was fought that memorable Battle between <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. and <HI>Charles the Har∣dy,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> where each Army run away, leaving the Field empty of Forces, and yet neither of the Princes Victorious. Some scour'd away out of fear to Die, and some out of hope to Live, that it was hard to say, which of the Soldiers made most use of their Heels in the Combat.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Mont l' Herrie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chastres.</NOTE> is the Town of <HI>Chastres,</HI> seated in the fairest An∣gle of <HI>France,</HI> where it confines to <HI>La Beauss,</HI> a Town of an ordinary size, somewhat bigger than for a Market, and too little for a City. It has a Wall and a Ditch, but neither further serviceable than to resist the Enemy at one Gate, while the People run away at the other.</P>
<P>Over a little River which might be easily mistaken for a Ditch,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Estampes.</NOTE> lies the Country <HI>La
<PB N="47" REF="28"/>Beauss,</HI> through which we Travel'd till the same Night we came to <HI>Estampes,</HI> a Town situate in a plentiful Soil, and water'd with a River of the same Name, which affords the best <HI>Crevices.</HI> It seems to have been a Town of some consideration formerly, as we might read in its Ruins. Without the Town is a fine green Meadow, where they use their Re∣creations. At my being there, Sir, the Sport was Dancing, an Exercise the <HI>French</HI> much delight in, and it seems this Natural Inclinati∣on is so rooted in them, that neither Age not the absence of a Fortune can prevail against it. On this Dancing Green were assembled not only Youth and Gentry, but Old Age and Beggary. Old Wives that could scarce set Foot to the Ground without a Crutch in the Street, here taught their Feet to amble, and you would have thought by the cleanly Conveyance and Carriage of their Bodies, they had been troubled with the <HI>Sciatica,</HI> and yet were so eager in the Sport as if their Dan∣cing days would never be over. Some were so Ragged, that a swift <HI>Galiard</HI> would almost have shak'd them into Nakedness. To have attempted staying them at home, or perswad∣ing them to work when they heard the noise of a Fiddle, had been a Task too unweildy for <HI>Hercules.</HI> In this mixture of Age and Con∣dition, we observ'd them in their Pastimes, the Rags being so interwoven with Silks, and wrinkl'd Brows so intermingled with their fresh Beauties, that you would have thought it a Mummery of Fortunes; as for those of both Sexes which were altogether past Acti∣on,
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>they were brought thither in Chairs, and trod the Dancing Measures with their Eyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inn</HI> we lay in was just like those of <HI>Normandy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way of Beg∣ging in an Inn.</NOTE> and all the difference we found was in the Morning; for there we were not troubled with such importunate Begging as in that Country. These had learn'd a more Neat and Compendious way of getting Mo∣ney, and Petition'd, not our Ears, but our Noses, by the Rhetorick of a Nose-gay, and by presenting us with a Tuft of dead Flowers, seem'd rather to Buy than Beg our Bounties. A sweeter and more generous kind of Cra∣ving than used in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and such as im∣ply'd a lucky Contradiction; for what is it else, that a Maid should offer her self to be Deflowr'd without prejudice to her Modesty, and raise a Fortune for her future Husband by the Usury of a Kindness?</P>
<P>Refresh'd with these Favours,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anger∣ville.</NOTE> we took our leaves of <HI>Estampes,</HI> and the Dancing Miscella∣ny, jogging on through many a beautiful Field of Corn till we came to <HI>Angerville,</HI> which was six Leagues distant. Here was nothing memorable, but that the Town had been taken by <HI>Mountacute,</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> as he went this way to the Siege of <HI>Orleans,</HI> The same Fate befel <HI>Touray,</HI> a Place not much beyond it in strength or bigness, only it had more confidence (as Mr. <HI>Savage,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman once said) in the Walls of Bones that were within it, than in the Walls of Stones which were without it.</P>
<P>This Town stands in the midway betwixt <HI>Estampes</HI> and <HI>Orleans,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Enter∣tainment at Dinner.</NOTE> and therefore a fit Stage to Act a Dinner on; and to it we went.
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>By that time we had clear'd our Selves of a great platter of Pottage, there entred upon us three odd kind of Fellows with their Hats on their Heads like cover'd Dishes. As soon as I saw them, I cast one Eye upon my Ri∣ding-Coat, and the other upon my Whinyard, not knowing what use I might have of my Steel to secure my Drapery; but when I had Survey'd their Apparel, I quickly altered that Opinion, and look'd upon them as the Excre∣ments of the next Gaol. Deceiv'd alike in both my Jealousies, on a nearer view I per∣ceiv'd their divertising parcel of Man's Flesh, in good truth, were neither better nor worse than errant <HI>French</HI> Fidlers, which in <HI>England</HI> we should have thought unworthy of a Whip∣ing-Post. Without asking Leave, or paying any Reverence to the Company, they fell a scrap∣ing in as harsh a Tone as the Courting of Cats at Mid-night, and as if that had not been Punishment enough, they abused our Ears with one of their Songs. By that little <HI>French</HI> I had, and the Simpering of a <HI>Fille de Joy</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> that Travelled in our Company, I perceiv'd it was Baudy, and to say the truth, Ranker than could be endur'd by any thing but a <HI>French-man;</HI> but what could I do? I had not <HI>French</HI> enough to call them Rogues handsomly, and the Scoundrels were below a Beating. A Gang of Rascals so infi∣nitely inferior to the Dignity of a Statute, that to Hang them, had been but to cast away a Rope, and disparage the Reputation of the Gallows.</P>
<P>After their smutty Song was ended, one of the Hanging-look'd Company, which after∣ward
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>appear'd to be Master of the Mis-rule, pull'd a Dish out of his Codpiss ,and sets it upon the Table before us, into which, according to the <HI>French</HI> Custom, we must cast in our Bene∣volence. Prescription <HI>Time out of Mind,</HI> has allow'd them a <HI>Sou</HI> for each Man at the Table, more they don't expect, and will take no less; no great Sum I confess, but 'twas richly worth the Musick, which was meerly <HI>French,</HI> Lascivious in Words, and Unskilful in the Playing.</P>
<P>We are now,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> Orleans.</NOTE> Sir, come into the Country of <HI>Orleans,</HI> which, though within the Limits of <HI>La Beauss,</HI> will be thought to be a Pro∣vince of it self. 'Tis a pleasant and plentiful Country of Corn and Vines, and may be call'd the Epitome of <HI>France.</HI> The Town is situate on the Declivity of a Hill, with a Bridge, a Wall, and Turrets capable of ma∣king Resistance to an Enemy. It is very Po∣pulous, the delicacy of the Air, and the com∣modiousness of the River, inviting the Nobi∣lity and Gentry to Cohabit in it, and they ac∣cept it, and are a more Humane and Courte∣ous sort of People than the <HI>Parisians,</HI> or any other in <HI>France</HI> that I have yet conversed with. The Buildings are like themselves, the Streets large and well kept, and give no Offence to the nicest Nostril. It has 26 Churches besides the Cathedral of St. <HI>Cross,</HI> and divers other Religious Houses. The Wine of <HI>Orleans</HI> is the greatest Riches of it self, and the Country about it. And in my Opinion, are the best in the Kingdom, in respect of the Delicacy of the Tast. I have heard of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentle∣man that tasting a Wine in <HI>Italy,</HI> called <HI>La∣chrymae
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>Christi, Christ's Tears,</HI> broke out into this pathetical Ejaculation, <HI>Dii Beni, quare non Christus Lachrymatus esset in nostris Regionibus?</HI> Why did not our Saviour weep in our Coun∣try? This <HI>Dutch-man</HI> and I were for a while of the same mind, and I thought I had a fair Quarrel with Nature for giving us none of this Liquor in <HI>England;</HI> but we were soon reconciled, when I perceiv'd it was offen∣sive to the Brain if not well allay'd with Wa∣ter; for which Reason it is said that the pre∣sent King hath banish'd it from his Cellar, no doubt to the great Grief of his Drinking Courtiers, who may therefore say with <HI>Mar∣tial,</HI>

<Q><L>Quid tantum fecere boni tibi pessima Vina?</L>
<L>Aut quid fecerunt optima Vina mali?</L></Q></P>
<P>This is a great Trading Town,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offices sold.</NOTE> and espe∣cially for Offices, which are here, as well as in the rest of <HI>France,</HI> saleable for great Sums of Money, which they squeeze again out of the Purses and very Blood of the Peasants, saying with our Serjeants of the <HI>Counter,</HI> that being forc'd to buy the Devil, they are allow∣ed to sell him at as hard a Bargain as they can. Twenty Years purchase, is said to be no extraor∣dinary Rate, and I have read that only by the Sale of Offices, one of the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> that shall be nameless, raised in twenty Years, one Hundred and thirty nine Millions of Li∣vres, which is about seven Millions Yearly. Of all ways to get Money the most ungene∣rous and mischievous, for the Sale of Offices necessarily draws after it the Sale of Justice.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="31"/>
<P>As this Town is sweetly seared in respect of the Air,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Palle-Malle <HI>and Recreati∣ons there.</HI></NOTE> so it has the conveniency of ma∣ny fine Walks, the best of which is of the East side of the City, called the <HI>Palle-malle,</HI> from a very Gentleman-like Exercise much used in this Kingdom. In this Walk, which is of a very great length and beauty, in a clear Evening you shall have all the Town appear, the aged People borrowing Legs to carry them, and the younger Arms to guide them. If any young Madamoiselle or Mon∣sieurs walk thither alone, they will quickly find a Companion, tho' perhaps, such with whom they have yet no familiarity. Thus do they measure and remeasure the length of the <HI>Malle,</HI> not minding the shutting in of the Day, till darkness has taken away the sense of Blushing. At all hours of the Night, if it be warm and dry, you may find them thus coup∣led, and if at the Years end there be found more Children in the Town than Fathers, this Walk and the Night are shrewdly suspect∣ed to be Accessaries.</P>
<P>There is another Walk in this Town,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">L'Estappe</NOTE> cal∣led <HI>L' Estappe,</HI> which is principally frequent∣ed by Merchants, to Confer about their Tra∣fick and other Negociations. It reaches to the Cloister of St. <HI>Cross,</HI> the Cathedral Church, of the Building of which I could never yet read or hear any thing but what is Fabulous, and not worth relating. Of the Town there is nothing more remarkable than the great Siege that was laid before it by the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> and was at last Relieved by <HI>Joan de Arc,</HI> Maid of <HI>Vancoleure</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> whom they called <HI>La Puelle,</HI> of whom you have an ac∣count
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>in our own Chronicles. Some Pro∣claim her a Saint, and others regard her but as a Sorceress: For my part, I will not flatter the best Fortune of my Country to the pre∣judice of Truth, nor will I think otherwise of this Female Warriour but as a Noble Captain.</P>
<P>In <HI>Orleans</HI> is also an University,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Uni∣versity of</HI> Orleans.</NOTE> Founded by <HI>Philip de Belle,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> 1312. for the Profession of the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> and was the first of that kind on this side the Mountains. It has four Professors, and the Place in which they Read their Lectures, is call'd <HI>Les Grandes Escoles;</HI> but rather ought to be called an old Barn converted into a School, by the Addi∣tion of five Ranks of Forms, and a Pew in the middle; you never saw any thing so se∣verely mock its name. Their Principal Go∣vernour is the <HI>Rector,</HI> which every three Months descendeth to another; so that once a Year every one of the Professors hath his turn of being <HI>Rector.</HI> They Read each of 'em in their turns, an hour every Morning in the Week, except <HI>Holy-days</HI> and <HI>Thursdays,</HI> their Hearers taking of them their Lectures with their Tables.</P>
<P>They are very Liberal in bestowing their Degrees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conferring Degrees.</NOTE> and deny no Man his Grace that is able to pay his Fees: <HI>Legem ponere</HI> is more powerful with them than <HI>Legem dicere,</HI> and the Blockhead that has but his Gold in his Hand, shall have a sooner Di∣patch than the best Scholar upon Tick in the University.
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>

<Q><L>Ipse licet venias Musis comitatus, Homere,</L>
<L>Si nihil attuleris, ibis, Homere, foras.</L></Q> It is Money that disputes best with them.</P>
<P>The Exercise that is performed before the Degree is taken,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ex∣ercises and Library.</NOTE> is very little and as trivially perform'd. When you have chosen the Law you would defend, they Conduct you into an old ruinous Chamber, which they call their Library; for my part, I thought it the Ware-House of a Second-hand broken Bookseller in <HI>Duck-Lane.</HI> Those few Books which were there, were as old as Printing, and amongst them all a Man could scarcely make up one Cover to resist the Depredations of the Rats. They did not stand Endwise, but lay one upon another, and were joyn'd together with Cob∣webs instead of Strings. He that would e∣ver guess them to have been look'd into since the long Reign of <HI>Ignorance,</HI> would have Condemned his own Charity, for I could not believe that the three last Centuries of Years had ever seen the inside of them, but that the poor Paper had been troubled with the Dis∣ease we call <HI>Noli me tangere.</HI> In this unlucky Room do they hold their Disputations, and after two or three Arguments urg'd, they commend the Sufficiency of the Respondent, and pronounce him worthy of his Degrees. That done, they cause his Authentick Letters to be Sealed, and in them tell the Reader with what Diligence and Pains they have sifted the Candidate: That it is necessary to the Com∣mon-wealth of Learning, that Industry should be Honour'd, and that on this ground
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>they have thought fit: <HI>Post angustias solamen, post vigilias requietem, post dolores gaudia;</HI> for so as I remember runs the Form, to recompence the Labours of <HI>N. N.</HI> with the Degree of <HI>Do∣ctor,</HI> or <HI>Licentiate,</HI> with a great deal more of the like formal Foolery. <HI>Et ad hunc modum fiunt Doctores.</HI></P>
<P>Next in this City of Letters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ger∣man <HI>Col∣lege.</HI></NOTE> as the <HI>French</HI> Writers call <HI>Paris,</HI> is the <HI>German</HI> College, where those of that Country Study, and for Decency, Order, and good Government, ex∣ceed all the rest of the University. A very hearty, good natur'd and loving Nation they are to all Men; but especially to the <HI>English.</HI> Only I could wish, that in their Speeches and Compliments, they would not use the Latin-Tongue, or else learn to speak it truly. Of these Ingredients is the University of <HI>Orleans</HI> compounded, and may pass for a Learned A∣cademy among those that never saw one. It could scarce be called an University, till the <HI>Jesuits</HI> came among them, but rather a School of Law; but they having brought with them those Branches of Learning, which before, were wanting in it, it may better deserve that Appellation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jesuites,</HI> I say, have a College here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Je∣suits <HI>Cal∣lege and Schools.</HI></NOTE> and in it apply themselves with all imaginable Diligence in the Study of good Letters, and make such good Proficients in it, that they exceed all other sorts of Orders in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, as having better Teachers, and more leasure to learn. That time which others spend at their High-Masses, and Canonical Hours, these Men bestow upon their Books, being exempted from these Duties by their
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>Order. They trouble not their Heads with Crotchets in Musick, nor Chanting their Services, but imploy their Brains upon Mat∣ters of State, supporting their Friends and ruining their Enemies.</P>
<P>To this advantage of Leisure,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their me∣thod in Teaching.</NOTE> they add an exact Method in their Teaching, which in∣deed is so excellent, that <HI>Protestants</HI> often∣times send their Sons to their Schools to have them prove Exquisite in the Arts they Teach. To them resort the Children of the Rich as well as the Poor, and that in such great numbers, that wheresoever they settle other Schools be∣come desolate, or frequented only by those of a more heavy and phlegmatick Constitu∣tion. In their Schools are eight <HI>Classes.</HI> The lowest is for <HI>Grammar,</HI> the second for making <HI>Themes,</HI> the third for <HI>Poetry,</HI> the fourth for <HI>Oratory,</HI> the fifth for the <HI>Greek Grammar</HI> and <HI>Com∣positions,</HI> the sixth for <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Rhetorick</HI> in that Language, the seventh for <HI>Logick,</HI> and the eighth and last for <HI>Philosophy.</HI> To each of these Schools or Classes, there is a several Reader or Institutor, who only intends that Art, and the perfection of it, which for that Year he Teacheth. The Year ended, he re∣moves himself and his Scholars with him, in∣to the Class or School next above him, till he has brought them through the whole Stu∣dy of Humanity. In the last Form, which is that of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> he continues two Years, which being expired, his Scholars are made perfect in the Universality of Learning, are Manumitted from their Tutors, and permit∣ted to follow their private Studies, but that
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>which is their greatest Art in Teaching, and fittest for their purpose, is,</P>
<P>That they do not only teach their Scholars an exactness in those parts of Learn∣ing which they handle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their obsti∣nate Hu∣mour.</NOTE> but endeavour to breed in them an obstinacy of Mind, and a sturdy eagerness of Spirit, that may render them hot and fiery Prosecutors of their own Principles, and impatient of Contradiction. This I have observed makes all of their Edu∣cation to affect Victory in all their Contro∣versies of Wit and Knowledge, and manage it with such a Violence, that even in their Grammatical Disputations, little Boys will maintain their Arguments with such a fierce∣ness and impatience, as surmounts their ten∣der Years. And all this pains the <HI>Jesuits</HI> take for nothing. The poor Peasants Son having the same Instructions with that of the Noble∣mans, and this procures the Society, Honour from the Great, and Love from the Poor, for the liberal Education of their Children, and gives them their choice of Wits to supply their Fraternities.</P>
<P>Thus do they promote their own Interest in all their Undertakings, insomuch,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Destructive to all o∣ther Reli∣gions.</NOTE> that Men of Wisdom and Judgment have been of Opinion, that the planting of a College of <HI>Jesuits</HI> in any place of the World, is a sure way to Re-establish the Religion they profess, and in time, to Root out any other. This was the effectual Method proposed by that Society, and their great Patron to the late King <HI>James,</HI> to exterminate <HI>Protestancy,</HI> and was follow'd by planting a Society of <HI>Jesuits</HI> in the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and setting up many private
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>Schools to teach Peoples Children <HI>Gratis:</HI> and you, and I Sir, who love the present <HI>English</HI> Government, have often lamented the great Numbers of that sort of Incendaries that yet remain in our Metropolis, since in the single Parish of St. <HI>Martins in the Fields,</HI> there is more than twenty <HI>Jesuits.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1554.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first Entrance, Banish∣ment, and Return.</NOTE> notwithstanding the great opposition made by the <HI>Sorbonists,</HI> and all other Orders, they first got footing into <HI>France</HI> in the College of <HI>Clermont;</HI> and in the Year 1594. <HI>John Chastel,</HI> a Novitiate of that Order, having wounded King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France,</HI> in the Mouth, they were Banished this Kingdom, and were not admitted again till 1604. and then upon Limitations more strict than ever. Now in this University they have many Houses, besides their Colleges and Monastery, and in short time 'tis believ'd that all <HI>France</HI> will be too little for them. Out of these <HI>Trojan</HI> Horses issue out those Fire brands and Incendiaries which put the Affairs of <HI>Christendom</HI> into Combustion, and there are forged all the Stratagems which threaten Protestant Countries with Desolati∣on; there they are at the Head of all Affairs, Civil and Ecclesiastical, and what you in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> may expect from such Counsels, is no difficulty to determine.</P>
<P>I have now done with <HI>Orleans</HI> and the <HI>Je∣suits,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our Jour∣ney back to</HI> Paris.</NOTE> and am preparing for my Journey to <HI>Paris.</HI> We went back the same way we came, though we were not so Fortunate to enjoy so good Company as we brought hither. Instead of the accepable Society of one of the <HI>French</HI> Nobles, some Gentlemen of <HI>Germany,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>and two Friars of the Order of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> we had the perpetual vexation of four Trades∣men of <HI>Paris,</HI> two <HI>Filles de Joy,</HI> and an old Woman.</P>
<P>The Artizans were so slovenly and greasily Apparel'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Trades∣men and an Appa∣rator.</NOTE> that a modest Apprehension would have thought them raked out of a Scullery. One of them by shewing his Ink-horn, would have made us believe he was a <HI>Notary,</HI> but by the thread of his Discourse, we fond him to be an <HI>Apparator,</HI> so full of Ribbaldry it was, and smelt so rankly of the <HI>French</HI> Bawdy Court; but this we need not wonder at in the Summer, for it is the vanity of every <HI>French∣man</HI> to appear greater than he is. The rest like <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> in <HI>London,</HI> were always babling about who were the fittest Men in the City to be <HI>Eschevins,</HI> Sheriffs for the Year ensuing.</P>
<P>Of the two Wenches one was so extreamly impudent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Gilts.</NOTE> that an immodest Ear would have abhor'd her Discourse, and of such a shameless Deportment, that her Behaviour would have frighted Lust out of the most Debauch'd Man living. Since I first knew Mankind and the World, I never observed so much impudence in general, as I did then in that young nasty <HI>French</HI> Whore, and I hope, I shall never be so miserable as to suffer two Days more the Torment of her Conversation. In a Word, she was a Gilt born to shame all the Fryars she had Traded with. The other Female, for I dare not call them Women, was of the same Profession, but not half so Rampant as her lewd Companion; for in re∣spect of her, a Charitable Stranger would have thought her Honest.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An old Wo∣man.</NOTE> The old Woman
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>was so very old, that 'twas a Question whe∣ther she had ever been young or not. It was well I had read the Scripture, otherwise I might have thought her one of the first pieces of the Creation, that by some mischance had escap'd the Deluge. Her Face was like that of the Sybil <HI>Erythraea</HI> in some old Print before a Ballad, or one of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s two Harlots in a Painted Cloath over the Chimney in a Coun∣try Ale-house, or like one of the Relicks of the first Age after the building of <HI>Babel,</HI> for her Complexion was a more dreadful Confusi∣on than that of Languages. But of this Com∣panion, and the rest of the Coachful, our arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> has at last deliver'd us, a Mercy we can never be sufficiently thankful for.</P>
<P>Having thus Survey'd as much of this Coun∣try as opportunity would afford us,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amiens.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>N.</HI> by whom I send this, having a strong desire to return into <HI>England,</HI> we resolv'd to accom∣pany him to <HI>Calais,</HI> and taking our Journey thither in a Coach of <HI>Amiens,</HI> better accompa∣ny'd than when we came from <HI>Orleans;</HI> for here we had Gentlemen of the best Quality, and in my Opinion, more Ingenious, and better Condition'd than any I had met with in all the Acquainance I had contracted in this Nation, and which appear'd wonderful, we had no vexation with us in the shape of a <HI>French</HI> Woman to torment our Ears with her impertinent Discourse, or punish our Eyes with her Complexion.</P>
<P>Thus Associated,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Loup.</NOTE> we wagg'd on toward St. <HI>Loup,</HI> where that Night we were destin'd to be lodg'd. As we pass'd by Water
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>from <HI>Amiens</HI> to <HI>Abbeville,</HI> in our Boat were two <HI>French-Gentlewomen,</HI> one of which per∣ceiving me to be <HI>English,</HI> ask'd me my Reli∣gion. I answer'd, as I justly might, that I was a <HI>Catholick,</HI> and she, for her better satisfa∣ction, offer'd me the little Cross on the top of her Beads to kiss, which I should have chose to have done rather than her Lips, and did as she desir'd me: Upon which the rest of the Company pronounc'd me, <HI>Un vrai Chri∣stien &amp; ne point un Hugonet, a true Chistian, and not a Hugonet.</HI> But to proceed on our Jour∣ney. The same day we parted from <HI>Paris,</HI> we passed through <HI>Luzarch</HI> and St. <HI>Loup,</HI> and came into <HI>Picardy,</HI> where the first Town of Note for nothing, is <HI>Clermont,</HI> from thence to <HI>Bretaul,</HI> where we were harbour'd, and our Entertainment such as in other Places, as Sluttish as Inconvenient.</P>
<P>The next day about ten,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> Amiens,</NOTE> we had fight of the fair and goodly City of <HI>Amiens</HI> A City very Capacious, and for that reason has been often honour'd with the Persons and Reti∣nues of many great Princes. Suburbs it has none, because a Town of War, nor Terri∣tories, because a Frontier; yet the People are indifferent Rich, have a good Trade, be∣sides the benefit of the Cathedral.</P>
<P>A strong Garrison,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Garri∣son.</NOTE> which in times of Peace maintains five hundred Soldiers, though the Cittadel being seated on a Hill in the lower part of the Town, it seems fitter to command than defend it, or to recover it being taken, than to save it from taking. Those that have seen it, and understand the Art of Fortifica∣tion, say it is Impregnable, nor am I able to
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>contradict it; for besides that it is a skill be∣yond my Profession, we were not allow'd to go within it. A commendable Policy in this Nation, and upbraids the Folly of the <HI>English,</HI> who for dozen of Ale, will shew a Foreigner the <HI>Curtain</HI> of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and let him mea∣sure the Sconces and Bulwarks, and for a Shilling more, he shall see the Provision and Ammunition, and walk the Round too. A <HI>French</HI> Crown fathoms the Walls of <HI>Dover-Castle,</HI> and Sounds the <HI>Peer,</HI> and for a Pint of Wine one may see the <HI>Block house</HI> at <HI>Tilbury</HI> in <HI>Essex;</HI> which is breaking open the Fences and Inclosures of our Nation, and ex∣posing our nakedness to Strangers. Another Circumstance that Ennobles this Town, is, that it is a <HI>Visedamate,</HI> and gives Honour to one of the Nobility, who is called <HI>Visedame</HI> of <HI>Amiens.</HI> In relation to the King, it has a Military Governour, and as a Corporation the chief Governour is a Mayor and Sheriffs, besides those of the Common-Council.</P>
<P>Another thing which adds to the lustre of <HI>Amiens,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Church</HI> Nostre-Dame.</NOTE> is the Church of <HI>Nostre-dame,</HI> a Name by which most of the principal Churches in <HI>France</HI> are known; for they give every where more Honour to our Lady than our Savi∣our, to <HI>Mary</HI> than to <HI>Jesus,</HI> and for one <HI>Pa∣ter-Noster</HI> that the People are enjoyn'n to re∣hearse, there are ten <HI>Ave-Marias,</HI> and to re∣compence one Pilgrimage to <HI>Christ</HI>'s Sepul∣chre at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> you shall hear of two hun∣dred taken to our Lady of <HI>Loretto,</HI> She has four times more Holy Days assign'd her, set Forms of Prayers prescrib'd in the two Books, one called the <HI>Office,</HI> and the other the <HI>Ro∣sary,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>whereas her Son must be contented with the <HI>Orisons</HI> in the Common-Mass-Book. Her Shrines and Images are more glorious and magnificent than those of her Son, and in her Chappels are more Vows paid than be∣fore the Crucifix.</P>
<P>Leaving our Lady, let us take a view of her Church,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Church compared with</HI> West∣minster Abbey.</NOTE> which is questionless one of the most glorious Piles of Building under Heaven. The whole Body is of most curious polish'd Stones, supported by Buttresses of excellent Composure, that add to the beauty as well as strength of the Fabrick. The Quire is fairer than the Body, thick set with dainty Pillars, most of them reaching to the top, in the fa∣shion of an Arch, I am not able to judge whe∣ther this or the Quire of the Chappel of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. at <HI>Westminster,</HI> is the more exqui∣site piece of Architecture, though I am per∣swaded that the most discerning Eye can find but little difference between them, and that difference rather subtile than sound; for if such Perfection may receive the word <HI>more,</HI> it may be said that of <HI>Amiens</HI> is more Majesti∣cal, and that of <HI>Westminster</HI> more Lovely, and yet neither disparage the other.</P>
<P>The Front which presents us with two Towers and three Gates, is incomparable,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Front and Inside.</NOTE> and all the Sacred Stories are so lively Engra∣ved, that you would not think them Carv'd, but Acted, and is infinitely above the ambi∣tion of Imitation. Nor is its Glory (like <HI>Nostre-Dame</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Rouen</HI>) all on the outside, for as soon as you enter in, you would think the Materials were all of Gold, and that the Glory of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple next
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>to the Description in the Holy Text is best read in this Church, of which it seems to be a well drawn Copy. <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s House in Hea∣ven that the <HI>Poets</HI> have built him, was never half so Gorgeous, and that imaginary Palace of <HI>Ovid</HI> is verified in this Mansion.</P>
<Q><L>Hic Locus est, quem si verbis audacia detur,</L>
<L>Haud timeam magni dixisse Palatia Regis.</L></Q>
<P>The Partition between the Body and the Quire is so overlaid with Gold, that the acu∣test would apprehend no other Substance. On the top of it is the Statue of our Lady in the just height and proportion of a Woman, with a Child in her Arms, all either of Gold or ex∣traordinary Gilded. The Glass of all the Windows are most curiously Painted, and the four Rows of Pillars with Tables on the top of them, containing the Pictures of Men of the better Quality of the City and adja∣cent Country, are exquisite pieces of Art and Admiration, and to view the beauty of the whole Structure, you would wish your self all Eye and Contemplation; and the only trouble of an ingenious Man is, to see the whole abused to Idolatrous purposes.</P>
<P>In this great Church are twenty four little Massing-Closets,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massing-Chappels.</NOTE> and in that of St. <HI>Peter</HI> hung an <HI>Indulgence</HI> granted by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> XV. <HI>Anno</HI> 1612. that gave an Exemption from the pains and place of Purgatory, to those who upon the Feast of <HI>All-Souls,</HI> and the <HI>Octaves</HI> of it, would pay their Devotions and Money in that Temple. At first, I thought this Charter a very Impolitick contrivance,
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>for in time it would empty the Popes Treasu∣ry, and at last put an end to Purgatory it self; but I soon perceiv'd my Error, for his Holy∣ness had restrain'd it in his Bull, only to the Natives of that Diocess, and left all the rest of the World in danger of those fansied Fires.</P>
<P>Here I had the Mortification not to see the Head of St. <HI>John the Baptist,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of St.</HI> John Baptist's <HI>Head.</HI></NOTE> which is said to be here entire, but I recover'd upon the remem∣brance, that in my Life-time I had seen it whole in more than an hundred of their Churches, besides pieces of it in double that number, and to believe them all to be true ones, is nothing, Sir, to what I find I must believe before I leave this Country, and I think in the complaisant humor I have taken up here, I shall not differ with them more a∣bout it, than with <HI>Pimper le Pim</HI> at <HI>Epsom,</HI> nor the famous Juglers at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> which de∣ceive my Eyes while they Pick my Pocket.</P>
<P>In a Boat like an <HI>English</HI> Lighter,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pignini, <HI>and the Story of it.</HI></NOTE> we went down the River <HI>Soame</HI> towards <HI>Abbeville,</HI> with thirty other Persons of different Nations, Lan∣guages and Conditions, but all as true Catho∣licks as ever Woman groan'd for; though, many of them, by the more than ordinary Civility they shew'd to us, I perceiv'd were but of the last Edition, whom I pity, but dare not keep them Company, for fear of what may follow, which is here too severe and true to make a Jest of. The first thing, we saw observable, was the Town and Ca∣stle of <HI>Pignini,</HI> a poor beggarly Place, which they make remarkable fora Victory they here obtain'd over the <HI>English,</HI> but in whose Reign, and under whose Conduct they could not
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>tell us; but add, that the <HI>English</HI> were disco∣vered from other Nations confederated with them, and all put to the Sword for mispro∣nouncing the word <HI>Pignini,</HI> which it seems then was no fitter for an <HI>Englishman</HI>'s Mouth than <HI>Shiboleth</HI> for an <HI>Ephraimite</HI>'s, or a <HI>Fiddle</HI> for the Mouth of a <HI>Friar;</HI> but this is all Ro∣mance, and that which has caused it to be mention'd in our and their Histories, was an Interview between our <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and their <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. upon a nine Years Pacification. The next Place which the Water convey'd us to, was the Town and Castle of <HI>Pont d' Armie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pont d' Armie.</NOTE> now scarce visible in its Ruines.</P>
<P>Three Leagues down this River is <HI>Abbeville,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abbeville.</NOTE> conveniently seated on the River <HI>Soame,</HI> which runs through it. 'Tis bigger than <HI>Amiens,</HI> but not so beautiful nor populous; for the Houses are of an old Impression, and there is much waste Ground within it. A Castle it once had, but now that defect is supply'd by Mounts and Bastions large and capacious, which, if well Man'd, need nor yield upon the first Summons. Without the Wall it is diversly strengthned, in some places with deep Ditches full of Water; the others only by a Boggish, Marish, Fenny Level, more dangerous to an Enemy, and serviceable to the Town than all the rest of its Fortifications, and therefore never guarded by the Soldters of the Garrison. They only keep Guard at <HI>Port de Boys,</HI> and <HI>Port St. Valery,</HI> the first looks towards <HI>Hesden,</HI> a Frontier Town of <HI>Artois,</HI> and the other towards the Haven of St. <HI>Valery,</HI> from which Places most danger was fear'd.</P>

<P><HI>July</HI> the last, we took Post-Horses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our Jour∣ney to</HI> Bul∣logn <HI>on Post-Horses</HI></NOTE> or things very like them, for <HI>Bulloign;</HI> as lean and poor were the Steeds, as Envy in the <HI>Poet, Maries in corpora tota</HI> was their Chara∣cter; for you might not only have counted their Ribs, but the Spur-galls had made such Casements through their Skins, that you might have Survey'd their Intrails, and given a better Account of the position of their Guts and Piping Lungs than <HI>Le Grey,</HI> or <HI>Mark∣ham</HI> in their Master-Pieces. A strange kind of Cattle in my Opinion they were, and such as had neither Flesh on their Bones, Skin on their Flesh, nor scarce Hair on their Skins. Sure I am, they were no Kin to <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Horses of the Sun, nor could we say of them, <HI>Flam∣miferis implent hinnitibus auras.</HI> For all the Neighing we could hear from the Proudest of them, was only an old dry Cough, which they brought from the late Campagne in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> which in earnest, was a great comfort to me, for by that noise I perceived there was some Life in them. Upon such Skeletons of Horses, or heaps of Bones did I or my Com∣panions never see our selves before; and yet the Monsieurs that Travel'd with us, thought themselves well Mounted, and cock'd and look'd as great as the little Gentleman that Rides in Triumph before the Bears and Bag-Pipes in <HI>London,</HI> and almost scratched their Behinds as often.</P>
<P>When we expected, however to find some∣thing of the Post in them, having Brib'd them on both sides, they began to move in an <HI>Al∣derman</HI>'s pace, or like Envy in <HI>Ovid.</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>
<Q><L><HI>Surgit humi pigre, passuque incedet inerti.</HI></L></Q> and out of this Melancholy Gravity no per∣swasion could urge them; the dull Jades were grown insensible of the Spur, and to hearten them with Wands would in a short time have distressed the Country for want of Wood. Now was the Cart at <HI>Diepe</HI> thought a speedy Conveyance, and we envy'd the hap∣piness of those that were blessed with a Wag∣gon, though it came with the hazard of the old Wife, and the two smutty Wenches. If good Nature or a Fright in the Journey did ever put any of them into a pace like a Gal∣lop, we were sure to have them Tire in the middle of our Stage, and put us with our own Feet to measure out the rest of our Jour∣ney. Weary of this Trade, I made bold to dismount the Postilion, and ascended the Trunk-Horse, where I sate in such a Magni∣ficent Posture, that the best Carrier in <HI>Paris</HI> would have envy'd my Felicity. Behind me I had a good large Trunk and a Portmantle, before me a bundle of Cloaks, and a parcel of Books. So that if my Stirrups could poize me equally on both fides, I could not fall backwards nor forwards. Thus preferred, I encouraged my fellow Travellers, who cast many an envious Eye upon my happiness, and there was not one of them that might not just∣ly have said of me, <HI>Tu as un Millieur temps que le Pape,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstre∣ville <HI>and its Garri∣son.</HI></NOTE> Thou hast a better time on't than the Pope in all his Grandeur.</P>
<P>On the Right Hand, and almost in the Midway between <HI>Abbeville</HI> and <HI>Bulloign</HI> we
<PB N="69" REF="39"/>left the Town of <HI>Monstreville,</HI> which we had no leisure (than our Horses) to visit. It is conveniently seated either for command or resistance, being built upon the top and de∣clivity of a Hill, well Fortified with Bastions and Ramparts on the outside, and within has a good Garrison of Soldiers. And indeed it concerns the King of <HI>France</HI> to look well to this important Place, being a border Town, within two Miles of <HI>Artois,</HI> and the taking of it would cut off all Intercourse between the Countries of <HI>Bulloign</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> with the rest of <HI>France,</HI> and of the like consideration are the Towns of <HI>Abbeville, Amiens</HI> and St. <HI>Quintin.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to the Country of <HI>Bullin∣nois,</HI> which, though a part of <HI>Picardy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bulloign.</NOTE> dis∣dains to be counted so, and will be esteemed as a Country of it self. It comprehends <HI>Bul∣loin, Escapes, Neuf-Chastel,</HI> and divers little Villages, and consists of Hills and Valleys af∣ter the manner of <HI>England.</HI> Nor is it only a Country of it self, but in a manner a free Coun∣try; for it is held immediately of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who without Question is a very Gra∣cious Land-Lady, for her Tenants enjoy a per∣petual Exemption from many Tributes and Taxations, with which the rest of <HI>France</HI> are miserably afflicted. Amongst others, from that of Salt, by reason whereof, and the goodness of their Pastures they make the best Butter in all the Kingdom, and a Firkin of it is a very acceptable Present at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Bullorgn</HI> is divided into the <HI>Upper</HI> and <HI>lower,</HI> distant from one another a∣bour a hundred Paces. The lower Town is
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>bigger than the Upper, which is called the City, better built, the Streets larger, and the People richer, most of the Merchants inha∣biting here for the conveniency of the Ha∣ven. The Upper Town is environ'd with deep Ditches, a strong Wall, a treble Gate, and two Draw-Bridges; a little Town it is, not above a flights shot over in the widest Place, and has but one Church in it besides <HI>Nostre-Dame,</HI> which is the Cathedral. The Streets not many, and those narrow, except in the Market-place, where the <HI>Corps du Gard</HI> is kept. What the Out-works are, or whe∣ther it hath any, I cannot tell, for though it be a time of Peace, and they very fond of it, their Jealousie would not permit me to walk upon the Wall, either within or without the Town, and I wish that we were not inferior to our Neighbours in the greatness of their Care, since we are equal to the best of them in the goodness of our Country.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the 28th of <HI>August,</HI> Mr. <HI>N.</HI> took Shipping for <HI>England</HI> with a fair Wind, I wish him a good Voyage, and these Papers safe in your Hands, with assurance that while I continue in <HI>France,</HI> you shall have a further Account of what occurs here, to</P>
