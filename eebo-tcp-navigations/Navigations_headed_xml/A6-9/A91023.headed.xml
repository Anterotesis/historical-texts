<HEAD>Prince ROBERTS disguises.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ir, my best of wishes waite on you, J write to you the last weeke concerning the passages of the Kings Army in and about <HI>Readding,</HI> but since they came to <HI>Colebrooke,</HI> they have bin still the same, they are no changelings, they need no pay from the King, for they pay themselves, and what they get with ease, they doe as freely spend, one night among the rest halfe a score of them being merry at my house, and three or foure of our Townesmen with them, thus one of them related of Prince <HI>Robert,</HI> how that af∣ter the skirmish at <HI>Worcester,</HI> some two dayes after he came to an ould womans house, being a widowe within a mile of the City, and askt her what victuals she had in the House, but not in the habit that
<PB REF="3"/> he wore in the field, but like a Country Gentleman, the ould woman tould him she had nothing but Collops and Egges, if he pleased to have any of them, he should be welcome, to be short ready they were made and he fell too roundly, afterwards he cal∣led for some drinke, she told him she had none but small drinke, J am a very pore widow, and have none but my selfe and my son, he asked her where her son was, she told him gone to <HI>Worcester</HI> to heare what newes of the Cavaliers, for she heard say she thanked God for it, that his Exce∣lency had made them fly the City, a com∣pany of rude knaves among them, she was sure of that they had halfe undone the Ci∣ty, if my sonne were come home he would tell you more, he asked her what she did thinke of Prince <HI>Robert,</HI> a pox choake Prince <HI>Robert</HI> said shee, he might have kept him where he was borne, in his owne Country, this kingdome has beene the worse ever since he landed, thers three pie∣ces for that word, for J am of thy mind.</P>
<P>With that he tooke Penne Jnke and
<PB REF="3"/> Paper, and writ a note to the Major of <HI>VVor∣cester,</HI> to this eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, he had given vnto this Widowe three pieces the bearer hereof for to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceale him from their searches which note he did injoine her to give it with her ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hand for she would be re∣warded nobly, What after followed yet we knowe not.</P>
<P>The Generalls army lying one Dunse∣more heath, his powers not being far of he riding as neare the Army as he durst within a narrowe Lane overtooke a fellow driving a horse laden with apples, he ask∣ed what he had there, the fellow told him he had apples and peares which he was carrying to <HI>Dansmore</HI> Heath, to sell them to his Excelencies souldiers, why dost not thou goe to the Kings Army replyed the prince, J heare they are generous sparkes and will pay double, oh said the fellow they are Cavaliers, they have a mad Prince amongst them, J was amonst them but J sould my ware at a very cheape rate, for the Devill penny J could get in the whole Army.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>The Prince asked him what he should give him for his loade, ten shillings said the fellow, hould thy hand said the Prince there is a piece for the, hould thou my Horse and change habit with me, and stay here while J sell thy apples, onely for a merry humour that J have, and at my com∣ming backe Jle give the a piece mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, the fellow was glad and willing, lent him his long Coate and Hat, away went Prince <HI>Robert</HI> thorough all the Army, selling his apples at any rate, viewing their strength, and in what kind they lay, and retourned backe againe, tooke his Horse, gave the fellow another piece, with this charge, to goe to the Army and aske the Commanders how they liked the fruite Prince <HI>Robert</HI> in his owne Person did but this morning sell them.</P>
<P>After the Battell at <HI>Keneton,</HI> Prince <HI>Ro∣bert,</HI> (his Excelencies Army being in and about <HI>Warwicke</HI>) within eight miles of the said City, was forced by reason of the ex∣cesse of raine, to take into a little Alehouse
<PB REF="4"/> out of the way, where he met with a fel∣low that was rideing to <HI>Warwicke,</HI> but stayed there by chance to drinke, to sell Cabbage Nets, to boyle Cabbage in, he bought the fellowes Nets, and gave him what he asked double, borrowed his Coate and told him he would ride upon his Horse some foure miles off, to put a tricke upon some friends of his, and returne at Evening, leaving his owne Nag and his Coate behind, also he left a Crowne in the Hostis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es hand for them to drinke while his returne, when he came to <HI>VVarwicke,</HI> he sould his Nets at divers places, heard the Newes, which side the Battaile went on, discovered many passages in the Town, which having done he returned againe, and tooke his owne Horse, then sent them word by him that he bought the Nets of that he had been with them, and sould them Cabbage Nets, and withall he wish∣ed him to tell them that it should not be long ere he would to requite the r kind∣nesse send them Cabbage.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>Prince <HI>Robert</HI> in the shape of a woman, tooke water at <HI>Brainford,</HI> came up to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> this last weeke, was here a day and a halfe, viewed the Workes, the Forts, the Baricadoes and Ambuscadoes, the strength of all the City and Suburbes, and in the same shape returned unto his Jnne, but he was very discontented, they wondering where the Prince had been, he tould them all he had been to see the City, how and in what manner you have heard related.</P>
