And finding it likely to giue some contentment to the Reader, and necessarie, as well for his better vnderstanding of the Historie, as for his knowledge of the strength and state of those Prouinces, which haue maintained so long and difficult a warre, against so potent a Monarke: I haue spent

<DIV2 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>The Duchie of Gelders.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here is great contradicti∣on of opinions betwixt both ancient and moderne writers touching the first beginning of the <HI>Geldrois,</HI> the which they can hardly reconcile, neither will I vnder-take the charge. <HI>Marlian</HI> saith, that in <HI>Iulius Caesars</HI> time, the con∣trie which is now called <HI>Gelders,</HI> was inhabited by the <HI>Menapiens.</HI> Others hold that it was the aboad of the <HI>Sicambrians,</HI> where-vnto I will yeeld, and that vnder that name the <HI>Cleuois</HI> were compre∣hended: through whose country, as well as through <HI>Gelders</HI> the riuer of <HI>Rhine</HI> doth runne: the which doth cast one of his branches betwixt the Duchies of <HI>Gelders</HI> and <HI>Cleues,</HI> being called <HI>Wahal,</HI> at the diuision of the Iland of <HI>Sgrauen-Weerdt,</HI> where that mighty fort was first built by Collonell <HI>Martin Schenck,</HI> and at this day in great esteeme. For which Iland there hath bin long de∣bate betwixt the Dukes of <HI>Gelders</HI> and <HI>Cleues,</HI> the
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
which is not yet decided, &amp; was begun betwixt the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and <HI>William</HI> duke of <HI>Cleues,</HI> father to this last Duke. The <HI>Battauians</HI> or <HI>Hollanders</HI> did also hold a part of that which is now called <HI>Gelders.</HI> There is no doubt but in <HI>Cae∣sars</HI> time, the <HI>Sicambrians</HI> did inhabit on either∣side of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the countries of <HI>Cleues</HI> and <HI>Geldres:</HI> as <HI>Wezel</HI> on the one side, with <HI>Burich, Cleef</HI> and others of the other side are of the Du∣chy of <HI>Cleues:</HI> And of <HI>Geldres, Nymegen</HI> lies of the one side and <HI>Arnham</HI> on the other, so as we may rightly say that the riuers of <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Wahal</HI> do run through these two Prouinces: for the <HI>Sicam∣brians</HI> hauing often bin defeated by the <HI>Romains, Augustus</HI> (who succeeded <HI>Caesar</HI> as <HI>Strabo, Sucto∣nius</HI> &amp; others do write) to be the better assured of them, and to keepe them in awe, transported a good number of them with other people on this side the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and there planted them. I will not deny that the <HI>Menapians</HI> did not first inhabit all that country which lies along the riuer of <HI>Rhine,</HI> to whom the <HI>Sicambrians</HI> did afterwards suc∣ceed, who enioyed a great continent of ground, on the one side as far as the <HI>Vbiens,</HI> and on the o∣ther vnto the ocean sea. The which <HI>Marlian</HI> con∣firmes by these words. The <HI>Sicambrians</HI> planted wheras the two great riuers of <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Meuse</HI> do meet and ioyne, extend themselues vnto the ocean sea▪ And in another place he saith. The <HI>Si∣cambrians</HI> are people wholy <HI>Germains▪</HI> inhabiting
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
beyond the riuer of <HI>Rhine</HI> nere vnto the <HI>Vbiens</HI> and <HI>Eburones,</HI> which are the people of <HI>Cologne &amp; Liege.</HI> So as wee cannot say that those which at this day are called <HI>Geldrois</HI> had the name of <HI>Si∣cambrians</HI> onely, but that vnder that name were also comprehended, they of <HI>Cleues, Monts, Marck &amp; Iulliers▪</HI> all neighbors to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and on the other side a part of the riuer of <HI>Meuse</HI> which passing by the country of the <HI>Eburones</HI> and the moderne <HI>Geldrois,</HI> comes &amp; ioynes with the riuer of <HI>Wahal</HI> (which is a branche of the <HI>Rhine)</HI> nere vnto <HI>Louestein,</HI> and then retayning the sole name of <HI>Meuse,</HI> washing the townes of <HI>Dor∣drecht, Rotterdam, Schiedam, Vlaerdingen</HI> and the <HI>Brill,</HI> it falls into the <HI>British</HI> sea, and so into the great Ocean. The which <HI>Sydonius Appolinaris,</HI> an excelent Poet in his time doth witnesse by these verses.</P>
<Q><L>Sic Ripa duplicis tumore fracta,</L>
<L><HI>Detonsus</HI> Vahalim <HI>bibat</HI> Sycamber.</L></Q>
<Q><L>So when the double swelling breakes the brinke▪</L>
<L><HI>Wahal</HI> shalbe the shorne <HI>Sicambrians</HI> drinke.</L></Q>
<P>But no man can directly say when or how these <HI>Menapians &amp; Sicambrians</HI> were diuided in these Prouinces thus distinguished, by which distinc∣tion they haue lost their ancient name. This Pro∣uince is at this day called <HI>Geldres,</HI> and the others <HI>Cleues, Iuilliers, Monts, Marck, Lieg,</HI> yea &amp; <HI>Westpha∣lia:</HI> the <HI>Etimology</HI> of which name of <HI>Geldres</HI> seems
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
ridiculous vnto me, as it is set downe in the chro∣nicle of <HI>Holland:</HI> I would rather hold with them which maintaine that the whole countrie hath taken his name of <HI>Gelduba,</HI> a towne in old time seated vpon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> wherof <HI>Tacitus</HI> makes ho∣norable mention, but at this day there remaines no memory thereof: <HI>Munster</HI> holds it for most certaine, that the first Lords of this country (who long after carried no higher title then of Aduocates, then of Earles, and in the end of Dukes) were two brethrē, issued from the French <HI>Wyncard</HI> and <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>old du Pont,</HI> who built a Castell called <HI>Pont-Gelder,</HI> which castle hath long retai∣ned that name of Pont, and is now ioyned to the towne of <HI>Geldre,</HI> which hath giuen the name to the whole Prouince, hauing at this day towards the North the countrie of <HI>Frisland,</HI> to the Nor∣west the <HI>Zuyderzee:</HI> vpon the South the riuer of <HI>Meuse</HI> ioynes vpon it, and diuides it from the Duchie of <HI>Brabant:</HI> to the South-east is the Du∣chie of <HI>Iuilllers.</HI> Towards the East is a part of the riuer of <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the duchie of <HI>Cleues,</HI> the which diuides it into two very vnequall parts: &amp; to the West is <HI>Holland</HI> and the siegneurie of <HI>Vtrecht.</HI></P>
<P>This Prouince is plaine and of a goodly scitu∣ation, hauing few mountaines, but maine heaths, &amp; great store of woods, which are both pleasant and profitable: among the which is that of <HI>Ech∣terwald.</HI> All their soile or ground for tillage is ve∣ry fertile in corne: and the pasture fat for cattle,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
especially that which lies vpon the bankes of the riuer of <HI>Rhine, Wahal, Issel</HI> and <HI>Meuse. Lewis Gui∣chardin</HI> and other writers of our time, confound the Earldome of <HI>Zutphen</HI> with the Duchie of <HI>Geldres,</HI> as we will shew in the particular descrip∣tion, and not confound it with that of <HI>Gelders.</HI></P>
<P>The Duchie of <HI>Gelders</HI> and the Countie of <HI>Zut∣phen,</HI> containe the townes of <HI>Arnhem, Zutphen, Nymegen,</HI> and <HI>Ruremond,</HI> which are the foure chiefe of the whole country, making the foure quarters of these two Prouinces, &amp; are scituated (as we will shew) vpon foure diuerse riuers, and are subiect to foure seuerall Bishops. Then are the townes of <HI>Venlo</HI> vpon the <HI>Meuse: Geldres: Stra∣len: Wachkendonck</HI> and <HI>Erkelens</HI> in the champian country. Then there is <HI>Hatten</HI> vpon the <HI>Issell, Elbruch,</HI> and <HI>Harderwyck</HI> vpon the <HI>Zuyderzee, Wa∣geningen</HI> vpon the <HI>Rhine, Tyel</HI> and <HI>Bomel</HI> vpon the <HI>Wahal.</HI> There are many townes which in anci∣ent time were walled in, but through diuerse ac∣cidents and disasters they are now wholy or in part spoiled, &amp; in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e last warres some haue bin vtterly ruined: yet as touching that little which remaines they doe still enioy their ancient priui∣ledges of townes, as <HI>Keppel, Burch, Ghendt, Baten∣burch, Montfort &amp; Eche</HI> with others, whereof we will make mention comming to their quarter, with the which there are aboue three hundred villages, hauing steeples &amp; the rights of parishes. The Estates of this Duchie consists vpon three
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
chiefe members of the Barons, whom they call <HI>Vry Heren;</HI> of the Nobles whom they call <HI>Red∣derschap,</HI> and of the foure foresaid chiefe townes▪ which Estates so farre as they are fallen from the Princes of <HI>Austria,</HI> hold their Colledge in the towne of <HI>Arnham,</HI> whereas in like manner the Chancerie and the Chamber of accoumpts re∣maines, as well for the Duchie as the county of <HI>Zutphen.</HI> Wherefore although it may displease <HI>Nymegen,</HI> as the last member added to the Duchy of <HI>Gelders,</HI> wee will begin with <HI>Arnham</HI> as the chiefe towne, and describe all the other townes in particular, according to their dignities.</P>

of <HI>Dousbourg, Bronchorst, Zutphen, Deuenter</HI> and <HI>Campen,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>Zuyder</HI> sea. This towne of <HI>Arnham</HI> is the chiefe of the Estate and siegneury of the <HI>Veluwe,</HI> which is one of the foure quarters of the Duchie of <HI>Gelders:</HI> vnder which towne are the townes of <HI>Hattem, Harderwyck, El∣bruch &amp; Wageningen,</HI> all walled; with many villa∣ges▪ burrowes and castels, with their iurisdictions and particular officers, subiect to the iustice of the <HI>Drossart</HI> or Lieutenant generall of that quarter, compassed in by the <HI>Zuyderzee,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the riuer of <HI>Issel,</HI> for which cause fish abounds there, and is very good cheape: besides there is great store of woods, vnder-woods and bushes, full of game for the pleasure of hunting. Neere vnto the said towne of <HI>Arnham,</HI> is an other member of the duchy, called <HI>Velwe Zoom,</HI> the which extends neer vnto <HI>Zutphin</HI> on the one side, and on the other it reacheth neere to <HI>Wageningen:</HI> in all which soile there are nothing but meades, and very pleasant and fertile pastures: which quarter hath a parti∣cular officer, which is the Iudge of <HI>Arnham,</HI> with foure assistants: and as for the <HI>Veluwe</HI> the <HI>Drossart</HI> hath ten assistants or councellors whereas hee keepe his courts of pleas. But touching the spiri∣tualtie, the towne of <HI>Arnham</HI> with the whole iu∣risdiction, before the troubles was subiect to the Bishoprick of <HI>Vtrecht.</HI> In this towne the Dukes of Geldres did in former times make their resi∣dence, and there they were intombed in the great Church before the market place, from

<P>BEfore I vndertake to describe <HI>Batauia</HI> (which is now called <HI>Holland)</HI> in old time the mo∣ther of good horsemen, and the mistresse of martiall discipline, not tributary, but com∣panions and allyes to the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> I thinke it fit in the relating the originall of the nation to make a repetition of that which hath bin collected of their antiquity by anciēt re∣cords, &amp; redeeming them from forgettfulnesse to restore them to their ancient glory and honour. To which effect as I hold it very absurd to abuse the reader with fables and lyes, so will I not al∣together reiect that which hath beene deliuered by our Ancestors. I know that the curious rea∣der affects new things more then ancient, the memory wherof is almost extinct: but I will in∣treat them to giue mee leaue to remember the honour which the <HI>Batauians</HI> haue purchased by armes, registred by al ancient writers, whereof we wil presently make mention.</P>
<P>First of all it is well knowne that the <HI>Batauians</HI> are originally descended from the <HI>Cattes</HI> a peo∣ple of <HI>Germany,</HI> whoe driuen from their na∣tiue soyle by intestine dissentions, hauing past the <HI>Rhyne</HI> sought a new habitation, and ceazing vppon the borders of <HI>Belgia</HI> which were
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>
inhabited, they planted them-selues in the Iland which the <HI>Rhyne</HI> doth enuirō. The which <HI>Tacitus</HI> a Knight and a faithfull <HI>Romaine</HI> writer doth witnesse in his booke which hee hath written of the manners of the <HI>Germains. Omnium</HI> (saith hee) <HI>harum gentium virtute precipui</HI> Bataui, <HI>non multum ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ripa, sed insulam Rheni amnis inco∣lunt,</HI> Cattorū <HI>quondam populus, et seditione domes∣tica in eas sedes transgressus, in quibus pars Romani Imperii fuerūt: manet honos &amp; antiquae societatis in∣signe</HI> &amp;c. That is to say: of al the natiōs (meaning the <HI>Germaines)</HI> the <HI>Batauian</HI> are the most valiant not farre from the bankes, but inhabiting of the Iland of the riuer of <HI>Rhyne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In ancient time a people of the</HI> Cattes, <HI>and by their ciuill dissentions transported into these parts to make a portion of the</HI> Romaine <HI>Empire, they yet inioy the honour thereof.

<P>The <HI>Batauians</HI> whilst they remained beyond the <HI>Rhyne</HI> were a part of the <HI>Cattes,</HI> chased away by Ciuill dissentions, planted them-selues vp∣pon the extremities of the <HI>Gaulish</HI> fronters In an Iland lying among the marishes hauing the Ocean Sea in Front, and the Riuer of <HI>Rhyne</HI> behinde and on either side. By these
<PB N="38" REF="24"/>
words wee are taught that the <HI>Battauians</HI> must fetch their first beginning from the <HI>Catthes;</HI> but it is questionable in what part of <HI>Germany</HI> the <HI>Catthes</HI> did dwell; for <HI>Iohn Stella</HI> who hath written the <HI>Philippi</HI> peregrination, sayth, that they did reside at <HI>Heidelberg, Heilbrunen</HI> and the <HI>Othonian</HI> forest. <HI>Schonerus</HI> the <HI>Mathematician</HI> makes them <HI>Saxons: Marlianus</HI> sends them to the forest of <HI>Hongary, Irenicus</HI> will haue then <HI>Turingians,</HI> all which opinions are full of obscure errors. But <HI>Stella</HI> flying a heigher pitch like vnto <HI>Icarus,</HI> one error drawing on an other, makes the <HI>Visipiens</HI> to be neighbors vnto the <HI>Catthes,</HI> assigning those of <HI>Fancford</HI> and <HI>Conflens,</HI> euen vnto the riuer of <HI>Moselle</HI> whereas it falls into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> Hee affirmes more-ouer that the <HI>Teucteres</HI> neighbors to the <HI>Catthes</HI> now called a part of <HI>Hessen,</HI> remay∣ning along the riuers of <HI>Laue</HI> and <HI>Lippe.</HI> For my part I hold them to be of <HI>Hesse,</HI> with the which many learned writers doe concurre, for <HI>Tacitus</HI> doth make them to bee neighbors to the <HI>Cherusques</HI> (which are the people of <HI>Lune∣bourg)</HI> and to the <HI>Hermodures,</HI> which were they of <HI>Misnia,</HI> beginning their iurisdictions from the forrest <HI>Hircinia:</HI> whereof the riuer <HI>Sala</HI> is a good witnesse for the enioying where∣of the <HI>Catthes</HI> were in continuall quarrell a∣gainst the <HI>Hermodures,</HI> which diuiding the

The which also they of <HI>Catsenelle∣bogen</HI> doe testefie, hauing a <HI>Castle</HI> vpon the banks of theriuer of <HI>Rhine</HI> of that name, shewing the an∣tiquitie of the name of the <HI>Cattes Meliboces:</HI> In the countrie of <HI>Hessen,</HI> wee haue also for re∣liks of this nation two villages of the <HI>Cattes,</HI> the one vpon the sea, called <HI>Catwyck vp Zee,</HI> and the other neere vnto the village of <HI>Rins∣burg</HI> called <HI>Catwycke</HI> vppon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> both of them of the iurisdiction of <HI>Holland;</HI> and <HI>Cat∣tes</HI> a towne of Zeeland, which some seuenty yeares past was drowned, And since, with <HI>Cort∣geen</HI> and the ile of <HI>Northbeueland</HI> (an <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Zeeland)</HI> within this ten yeares recouered from the sea. There are some that affirme that the cause why the <HI>Cattes</HI> remooued from the place of their birth was, for that they lost a battayle a∣gainst the <HI>Hermodures,</HI> being in continuall quar∣rell for their salt, which (as we haue said before) was made of the water of the riuer of <HI>Sala,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>
whereby the <HI>Hermodures</HI> became more puissant; but I hold it a detraction from the <HI>Batauian</HI> ho∣nour for that they by the assistance of the <HI>Romans</HI> hauing obtained a great victory, constrained the <HI>Cattes</HI> to change their place, and to come to inhabit this Iland of the <HI>Rhyne.</HI> For which cause the <HI>Cattes</HI> may with great reason bee said to bee the beginning andfirst Fathers of the <HI>Batauians,</HI> or <HI>Hollanders.</HI> A people renowned for their skill in warre, <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> attributing much to their industry and dexterity in the dis∣posing of an armie, and also in obeying their Commaunders, to take or put of the combat as it should be thought fit; of great courage, firme and hard bodies, wel lymmed, of a fierce and me∣nacing aspect, fearefull for the horrible length of their beardes and hayre, which fashion and countenance hee saith was not lawfull for them to leaue off, or change although they had brought victory from their enemies.</P>
<P>Some say that <HI>Batto</HI> issued from the royall bloud of the <HI>Cattes,</HI> was moued to change his naturall abode to a new one, not for the desire hee had to finde a better or more fertile coun∣try, or in regard of too great a multitude of people (which are the two maine occasions that nations remoue their ancient habitations) but that his step-mother laid diuers ambushes for him, and fearing to bee poysoned (beeing at oddes with her) his father consenting thereto,
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
or at least not opposing it: By reason whereof, what with the splendor of his heroicall vertues, his gratious and amiable carryage, and his con∣dition truly royall, hee drew vnto him a good part of the Nobility, and a great number of the people, who beeing out of hope of better times followed him willingly; and by the coun∣cell of the King of <HI>Tongres</HI> (his good father) hee addrest him-selfe to the confines of <HI>Belgiae</HI> there to inhabit: and hauing past the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> not farre from the riuers of <HI>VVahal</HI> and of <HI>Meuze,</HI> hee happily built the Castle of <HI>Battengbourgh</HI> vppon the riuer of <HI>Meuze,</HI> which hauing past at the parting of the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> where the <HI>VVahal</HI> retyres and takes his course apart, hee inioyed all the whole circuit, euen to the <HI>Ocean</HI> Sea, par∣ting the land amongst the Nobles and common people so that of his name it was called <HI>Battauia,</HI> which signifies nothing else but the heritage of <HI>Batto,</HI> as if one should say <HI>Batous Haue,</HI> for <HI>Haue</HI> in the old Dutch, and yet at this present signifies heritage: So that then this Prouince hath taken his name and that lawfully, from a Prince, the son of a King: al which is witnessed by diuers au∣thors, amongst whom the most worthy of beleefe is <HI>Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> a <HI>Romaine</HI> Knight, a rare writer of the Story of <HI>Augustus,</HI> and Commissary for <HI>Gaule Belgique,</HI> who makes mention of <HI>Claudi∣us Ciuilis</HI> descended from <HI>Batto,</HI> issued from a roy∣al branch of the <HI>Batauians</HI> or <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>

Here you may see that <HI>Plyny,</HI> not without great reason, called this Isle the most noble Isle of <HI>Bat∣to:</HI> The which name of <HI>Batto</HI> hath heretofore spread it selfe very far amongst the <HI>Allemans</HI> and <HI>Dalmatians,</HI> and <HI>Dion</HI> a <HI>Romaine</HI> Historiographer makes mention of two <HI>Battoes;</HI> the first <HI>Batto</HI> duke of <HI>Bruces</HI> (which is a part of <HI>Pannonia,</HI> which I now hold to be the country of <HI>Prussia</HI> confining <HI>Poland &amp; Hungary:)</HI> the other <HI>Batto Desidiate,</HI> who stirred vp the <HI>Dalmatians</HI> (beeing too much exac∣ted vpon by impositions) to take armes against the <HI>Romanes,</HI> to whom hee gaue many affronts.

<P>THere are great diuersities of opinions about the etimologie of the name of it, some there are that would haue it called <HI>Durdrecht</HI> and not <HI>Dordrecht,</HI> saying that this word <HI>Drecht</HI> was

heretofore as much as to say a <HI>Fayre</HI> or a free market, called in lattin <HI>Forum:</HI> Of the which name there are diuers townes after the names of great personages, as <HI>Forum Varronis</HI> not farre from <HI>Milan; Forum Cornelii</HI> in <HI>Emilia,</HI> which is now called <HI>Imola.

<P>This Towne is long in forme of a compasse rich and well peopled, and indeed a very store∣house of all things necessary for mans life: being since the yeare of our Lord, 1421. become an Iland: the <HI>Wahal</HI> the <HI>Meuze,</HI> and the <HI>Sea,</HI> by the breach of a ditch filleth all the gulph (which be∣fore was firme land and ioyning to the Dutchy of <HI>Brabant)</HI> and drowned 72.

<P>THis deluge hapned by the wickednesse of a country-man that enuying the prosperity of his neighbour, assayed to drowne his land that lay neere the Sea, or at least to spoyle it, not thin∣king what would follow: and to accomplish this his cursed resolution, he wrought a hole through the earth and made a gutter, that the water of the Sea might drowne his neighbours land; but the vehemency of it was so great, that of a little streame, the Sea gayning more, it made such a gap, that it was vnpossible to be stopt, and
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
so all the country about <HI>Dordrecht,</HI> as it is yet to bee seene was lost. Notwithstanding since by little and little <HI>Adrian Cornellis vander Mylen</HI> a Bourgue maistet of the said town and his chil∣dren haue recouered, and yet dayly doe reco∣uer a good part of it, by vertue of a grant giuen by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth Emperour to the said Bourguemaister, so that at this day there are fayre feeldes, in firme land, adioyning to the sayd Towne, with the little Castell of <HI>Craesteyne,</HI> belonging to the said <HI>Vander Mylen.</HI></P>
<P>This Towne especially the streete called <HI>Den Langen-dike</HI> hath the most fayre and lofty buildings that are to bee found in all <HI>Holland,</HI> with their store-houses and caues for Wines all vaulted, so that they neuer see neither Sunne or Moone. There is a fayre great Church where there had wont to bee a Colledge of <HI>Chanons.</HI> The history of <HI>Holland</HI> sets downe certaine foolish fables of the foundation of this Church, which I forbeare to repeat for that they are too ridiculous.</P>
<P>A Faucon shotte from that part of the towne towards <HI>Papendrecht;</HI> there are high and eminent reliques of the Castle of <HI>Merwe</HI> neere to the ditch where before the Inundation was, as also of the Village and Barony of <HI>Merwe,</HI> from whence the Lords of <HI>Asperen</HI> and <HI>Langueraeck</HI> haue their Barony, inioying yet

<P>In this drown'd land and in the <HI>Merwe</HI> there are great store of <HI>Salmons</HI> and <HI>Sturge∣ons</HI> taken, besides it abounds in sundry other sort of fishes, the water beeing for foure or fiue leagues sweete.</P>
<P>The priuiledge and right of the staple for all sorts of Marchandise, as Wine, Corne, Wood and other commodities that passe by them comming out of <HI>Germanie, Gelderland, Cleues</HI> and <HI>Iuilliers</HI> belonging to this towne of <HI>Dordrecht.</HI></P>
<P>VVell seeing wee haue made mention of this word <HI>Staple,</HI> it followes necessarily for the true vnderstanding of it, that we say something both for the name and vse of it.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Estaple</HI> is a <HI>French</HI> word, deriued from the lattin word <HI>Stabulum,</HI> so that the word <HI>Staple</HI> is a market or publicke place in a towne ordained for the bestowing of VVine, Corne, VVood and other Marchandise that comes frō other countries; euery Towne hauing their se∣uerall priuiledges, according to the graunt of the
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>
Prince. Not without great greefe and vexation to others both Marchants and Marryners that bring them thether. As for example, The towne of <HI>Arras</HI> is the <HI>Staple</HI> for <HI>Arthois,</HI> and <HI>Valenciennes</HI> for <HI>Henault,</HI> for Wines that are brought out of <HI>France</HI> by land into the <HI>Low-Countries:</HI> So that the Marchants or Carryers are constrained to bring them thether before any other place, and there to bee stayde a certayne time in the <HI>Staple</HI> to see who will buy in the Market, the which beeing done they may carrie them away whether they thinke best.</P>
<P>The towne of <HI>Middlebourgh</HI> in <HI>Zealand</HI> is the <HI>Staple</HI> for Wines that come from <HI>France, Spayne▪ Portugal</HI> and other Countryes brought thether by Sea. But the priuiledges of the town of <HI>Dordrecht</HI> are more strickt and compelling; for they are of fuch force and vertue, that what-souer is brought either by the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> or <HI>Meuze,</HI> be it corne, wine, pitch, cole or any other Marchandise passing by them, they are compelled (vppon paine of forfeyture of all, if they bee taken, not hauing payed their duty) to discharge their boates or barkes in their Hauen, and to paie all rights, customes, impostes and other duties what-soeuer, and also to discharge their Marchaundise in Shippes of the towne or of the Cittizens and free Marryners: or else to make some agreement with them and so
<PB N="42" REF="31"/>
they may passe them in those that belong to the custome or impost. And notwithstanding that the priuiledges are at this present diuers, and vary one from another, according to the nature of the marchandise and condition of the townes to whome such priuileges are graunted, yet they haue euer from the first beginning beene called by the name of <HI>Estaple.</HI> The which (being some∣times in one towne, sometimes in another, either for the scituation or some other occation) cause a great commodity and benifit to the country both in generall and particuler, and a faire reue∣new and large profit to the Prince of the same.</P>
<P>This towne as the first in rancke hath power to coyne both siluer and gold, a priueledge deni∣ed to any other towne of Holland what-so-euer. In this towne the Prince or Earle of Holland is put in possession of this county, taking his oth to the states of the country, and receiuing their ho∣mage and feallty.</P>

the middest of a good land fit both for tillage and for pasture, enuironed with faire country houses, Farmes, little woods and many castles and villages, and to conclude seated reasonable high, and very pleasant. It hath one very great Church with a high steeple supported with great columnes or pillars, and much longer then any other in the Low-countries. There passeth now through it a riuer called Sparre, which falls out of a lake of fresh water into the chanell that runnes towards the townes of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>Leyden,</HI> which is called the sea of <HI>Harlem;</HI> which riuer hath bene drawne with great labour and charge from that of <HI>Tye</HI> by the sluces of <HI>Spa∣rendam,</HI> about halfe a league from thence: before the towne on that side towards <HI>Leyden</HI> there was heretofore a very pleasant wood which during the seege of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was cut downe by the <HI>Allamaines</HI> that were quartred on that side in the village of <HI>Hemsted;</HI> But within a few yeares after the Magistrate of the towne caused it to be replanted, so as in a short time it became as plea∣sant as it was before, seruing the inhabitants of the towne for delightfull walkes for the excersise of their spirits, and keeping many people of the towne from the Tauernes and such other places, in passing their time there. There is there like∣wise made very great store of fine white linnen cloth, much desired and sought for from <HI>Spaine, Italy,</HI> and other countries, and also good wollen

cloth, which for the dye equalls any other coun∣try, and is like-wise transported into forraine regions.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Etymology</HI> or deriuation of the name, I may not rely vpon <HI>Lewis Guichardine,</HI> who hath followed the old Dutch chronicle of <HI>Holland,</HI> but rather follow that learned Phisition and Historiographer of <HI>Horne,</HI> Doctor <HI>Adrianus Iunius,</HI> who affirmes that the <HI>Harlemois</HI> are is∣sued from the bloud of the Kings of Freezland, who first built both the their towne and castle in the yeare of the natiuity of our Sauiour Iesus Christ fiue hundred and sixe. The castle was seated vpon the chanell that runnes towards <HI>Egmont,</HI> not farre from <HI>Heimskirk,</HI> all built of great and large bricke, as yet at this day is to be seene by the ruines and ground worke of the walls. The demolishment whereof some attri∣bute to the tyrany of the Lord of the place, o∣thers to the fury of the people, who sought to extirpe and roote out the Nobility. This castle alone at this time was not demolished, but like a violent thunder they threw downe all to the ground. Seeing wee are speaking of this castle, I thinke it not amisse (although it be set downe in the history of the Netherlands) to re∣late a memorable accident that then hapned, as a strange▪ note of true coniugall loue. And thus it was.</P>

The Lord of the place hauing by his exaction and cruelty made him-selfe odious to all his peo∣ple, and he and his wife being beseeged, and so prest for want of victualls, that he was compel∣led (hauing no other meanes to escape) to enter into treaty for the rendering of the towne. His wife (atrue mirror of piety and loue towards her husband) among other articles for the ren∣dring of the towne, capitulated that shee might haue as much of her most pretious mooueables as she could carry out at one time, the which be∣ing graunted, shee (with the helpe of her cham∣ber-maide) carried her husband lockt in a chest out of the castle, leauing all her rings and iewells behind her: In imitation of the wife of <HI>Guelphe</HI> Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> who in the like necessity prayed the Emperor <HI>Conrad,</HI> that she and her Ladies might carry out that which they held most deare and pretious: the Emperor imagining it was no∣thing but their rings and iewels, shee (and all the Ladies after her example) tooke her hus∣band on her shoulders and her little chil∣de in her armes and so issued forth.

of the said towne of <HI>Harlem</HI> that from father to sonne they haue held, and yet to this day doe hold it, that about a hundreth and seauenty years agoe there dwelt in the sayd Towne in a very fayre house, which is yet to bee seene standing right against the royall Pallace, one <HI>Laurence Ians</HI> surnamed <HI>Sachristain</HI> (which was a good and honourable hereditary office in his family) to whome this place of honour (which some other heretofore haue robd them off) belongs. This man walking forth for his recreation into the Wood of <HI>Harlem</HI> (as it was the custome the of best <HI>Burguers</HI> after dinner &amp; supper) began to cutte in little peeces of wood the letters of his name, printing them on the backe of his hand, which pleasing him hee cutte three or four lines, which he beat with Inke and printed them vpon paper, wherewith beeing much ioyd (as it is said the worekman delights in his worke) he determi∣ned to find out an other kind of inke more fasting and holding, and so with his kinsman <HI>Thomas Pe∣terse,</HI> who left foure sonnes; who al came to the place of <HI>Burguemaisters</HI> (which I speak to that end that I would haue no man thinke that so noble an inuention could haue beginning from low∣spirited and mechanical men) found out an other way to print whole sheetes, but of one side only, which are yet to be seene in the said towne, and besides a booke in <HI>Flemish</HI> called the mirrour of health; which hee did in the instancy of this art,

no inuention being brought to perfection at the first assay) and assaying to print the sheet on the other side, the right side tooke not, and so hee spoyled the impression. Afterwards he changed his letters of wood into lead, and after that into tinne to make them more firme, lesse plyant and more dnrable, the remainder of which Caracters are yet to be seene in the house of the said <HI>Lau∣rence,</HI> since possest and dwelt in by <HI>Gerard Thomas</HI> an honourable old Cittizen, who died within this fifty yeares. This new Art neuer seen before made euery one so inamoured of it; that it yeelded him much profit, and his businesse so in∣creased that he was constrayned to take seruants to help him, but in the choyce of them he was so curious, that hee intertained not any, but hee took an oth of thē not to discouer the art to any body, beeing very desirous to keepe the princi∣pall secrets to him-selfe; yet notwithstanding al his care, one of his seruants called <HI>Iohn</HI> of his owne surname, who hauing learnt to compose, cast the letters, and other things belonging to this Art, spyed his time and oportunity to runne away, the which he did vppon Christmas day at night when euery body was at Euen song, and his maister absent, taking away the Caracters &amp; other thinges belonging to this Art, running a∣way like a Domestique theefe with the goods and honour of his maister to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> from thence to <HI>Cologne,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Mogunce</HI> or

<P><HI>Polidore Virgill</HI> in his treatise of the inuention of things, attributes it to one <HI>Iohn Gutttenbergh</HI> a gentleman of <HI>Germany.</HI> I must needs grant that the art by succession of time was brought to a greater perfection then in <HI>Holland,</HI> but they like infants suckt their milke from <HI>Laurence Ianse</HI> of <HI>Harlem</HI> the first inuentor. Well wee see that it was sufficiently diuulged, for in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred, fourty eight, one <HI>Conrade</HI> (a <HI>German</HI> also) carried this art into <HI>Italy</HI> and so to <HI>Rome.</HI> After him <HI>Nicholas Iohnson</HI> a <HI>French</HI> man inricht it meruelously; but aboue all <HI>Al∣dus Manutius a Roman,</HI> a man well read and very learned in the <HI>Greeke</HI> and latin tounges, brought this art to perfection, by his extreame dilligence &amp; great trauail, neuer shrinking at any charge or trouble but only respecting his honor &amp; the pub∣lique good, so that euery man desired his bookes

<P>The people of this towne of <HI>Harlem</HI> had the honour of the taking of <HI>Pelusium</HI> (now called <HI>Da∣miette</HI> a famous towne in <HI>Aegipt)</HI> which the Christian princes had long time beseeged, among whome was <HI>William</HI> Earle of <HI>Holland:</HI> While the Princes were consulting how they might first get the hauen of the town, wnich was shut vp with 2. great chaines of yron, fastned to two strong Towers from one side to the other, they of <HI>Harlem</HI> caused a hulke or two bee armed from the toppe to the bottome with sawes made of yron a purpose to cut the chaynes, and with a good gale of wind at the returne of the Sea, ranne with full sayles spread against the chaines, which they broke: and notwithstanding all the arrowes and other shotte made at them from the two Towers, past on and got the hauen, making passage for the rest of the Christian ships and so the towne was wonne The honour whereof was giuen to them of <HI>Harlem,</HI> and in memory of their valour their armes (which before was a dry <HI>Tree)</HI> were by the Emperour changed to a <HI>Swoord</HI> com∣passed with sixe stars, to the which the Patriarke of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> added vpon the point a crosse <HI>Patteé,</HI> which are at this day the Armes of the towne of <HI>Harlem.</HI></P>

<P>THe Towne of <HI>Delf</HI> (heretofore renowned) (but now much more) for brewing good beere which they transporte through all <HI>Hol∣land, Zeeland</HI> and other neighbour countries, not much inferior to that of England) holdes the the third ranck and suffrage in the session of the Estates for the Country of <HI>Holland.</HI> This Towne hath his name from his situation, being seated vpon a chanell that comes from the <HI>Hage,</HI> and falls into the Riuer of <HI>Meuze</HI> at <HI>Delfs-Hauen,</HI> which chanel cut in a right line cost a great deal of labour and charge before it was made.</P>
<P>This town was first founded by <HI>Godfrey</HI> called the crooke-backe Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who beeing
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
called in and assisted by the Bishoppe of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> chased out of <HI>Holland</HI> Earle <HI>Robert</HI> the <HI>Fri∣son,</HI> the Lady <HI>Gheertruyd</HI> his wife and hir little son that she had in her first marriage by <HI>Florent</HI> the first of that name and sixth Earle of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>This Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> inioyed the said Earl∣dome aboue foure yeares, during which time he built the towne of <HI>Delf.</HI></P>
<P>But the little sonne of <HI>Geertruyd</HI> being growne somewhat bigger with the helpe of neighbour Princes, both <HI>Germaines</HI> (in regard of his mo∣ther) and others, re-entred with a goodly army into <HI>Holland</HI> to giue him battaile, where he ouer∣threw him, and hauing chased him out recouered al his coūtry: But shortly after one of his seruants as hee was at the priuy run him into the funda∣ment with a Iauelin, of which hee died in the towne of <HI>Maestricht.</HI></P>
<P>This towne of <HI>Delf</HI> was straightly beseeged by Count <HI>Albert</HI> of <HI>Bauaria</HI> (as you may read more amply in the history of the <HI>Netherlands)</HI> so as be∣ing constrained to yeeld, the Earle caused a great part of the wall to bee throwne down. Yet not∣withstanding shortly after they did him great seruice in the warre hee had with the <HI>Frisons</HI> (the other Townes refusing to ayd him) and couragiously released certain <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> soldiers engaged in a Fort beseeged by the <HI>Frisons,</HI> for which duty and valour of theirs, the Earle consented to the re-building
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
of their walles. There befell a pittifull accident to this towne in the month of <HI>Maie</HI> 1536. being set on fire by casualty &amp; the fire so disperst that it was almost burned before there could bee any helpe, yet they wanted not water, for it hath two chanels that passe through the towne.</P>
<P>But the wind being very vehement, so disperst the fire, that there scarce could any thing be sa∣ued; yet like the <HI>Phaenix</HI> renuing out of her ashes, this Towne was built againe more fayre and magnificent then euer before, remedying their error in the first building (which was the cheefe cause of their ruine) by not suffering one house to bee thatcht with straw; but high and state∣ly buildings without, with their inward or∣naments and furnitures so neat and fitting that in the whole <HI>Netherlands</HI> it is not to be parraleld; the streets likewise so cleane and well kept, that notwithstanding the greatest rayne there is no durt to touch the shoo, so as indeed they seem to be alwaies washt.</P>
<P>In this fire there hapned so memorable an ac∣cident, that (happily) the like hath not beene re∣corded in antient or moderne storries: It is most true that <HI>Pliny</HI> and other authors set downe (as a matter of notable and great considerati∣on) that the young <HI>Storkes</HI> when the old ones are growne in yeares and past helping of them∣selues supply that want by feeding them, and when their winges fayle in passing the Sea,
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
the young ones take them on their backes: But that which hapned of the same birds in the towne of <HI>Delph</HI> is of greater consequence and more remarkeable.</P>
<P>This towne is so seated for the feeding and bringing vp of these birdes that it is hard to see any house vppon the which they are not nested to breed in: This fire hapned vppon the third of <HI>Maie</HI> in the yeare aforesaid 1536. at which time the young <HI>Storkes</HI> are growne pretty and big, the old ones perceiuing the fire to approch their nests, attempted to carry them away but could not they were so waighty, which they perceiuing neuer ceased with their winges spread couering them, till they all perished in the flames. <HI>Gaspar Veldius</HI> (an author of reuerent esteeme) in his booke of <HI>Storkes</HI> recountes the same, and also <HI>D.

<P>In this towne was borne that abhominable Monster for heresie and imposture called <HI>Dauid George,</HI> but his right name was <HI>Hans van Burcht</HI> a painter of glasses and the sonne of a painter, one that infected with the poyson of his heresie the towne of <HI>Munster</HI> in <HI>Westphalia;</HI> A man altogether vnlearned, yet of so subtile a memory and vnder∣standing and withall so eloquent, accompanied with a kind of grauity, that hee could perswade his followers to what hee thought good, whereby he not onely made him-selfe chiefe head of a new sect, but caused him-selfe by his desciples and followers to bee adored as GOD him-selfe, perswading them that hee was the true <HI>Mes∣sias.</HI></P>
<P>This Gallant (or rather Diuell) was married and had children, gouerning his familie in outward shew indifferent honestly, but in effect had nei∣her
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>
religion, vertue or any goodnesse whatsoe∣uer: notwithstanding (the people being for the most part light and inconstant, louers of no∣uelties, wicked and contentious, feeding their ambition by the first occasion offered) hee sowed and dispersed his heresie vnder colour of diuers extrauagant lawes throughout the lower <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> being already so far aduanced in this businesse that diuers that followed him as his desciples bound them-selues to the will of this damnable Arch-hereticke: But this impiety beginning to bee discouered and the Magistrate making dilli∣gent pursuit and seuere inquisition after it, as the case required, this monster fled to <HI>Basil</HI> in <HI>Suit∣zerland</HI> with his wife, children, houshold and all other his baggage, where being ariued hee was taken to be a rich Marchant of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> fledde thether for his religion, and to auoyd the fury of the Imperial <HI>Placarts,</HI> where by his friends and confederates hee was welcomed and much made off. When hee went to Church with his wife and children hee was accompanied (like a great Lord) with a troope of followers and seruants, shewing at his first comming great liberallity to the poore, which made him to bee much admyred. Being well prouided of money he bought a fayre house in the towne, and a Cas∣tle called <HI>Benningen</HI> halfe a league out of the towne, dwelling sometimes in the one and some∣time in the other: To augment his loue and
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
reputation with the Cittizens hee matcht some of his children with the principall of the towne endowing them very ritchly, still aduancing and teaching in priuate his most damnable here∣sie, confirming those that were absent by letters and bookes which hee caused to bee printed in his Castle of <HI>Beningen:</HI> Hee dyed in the sayd towne of <HI>Basil</HI> in the yeare of our Lord 1556. for meere greefe that one of his followers was reuolted, fearing that by his meanes hee might be discouered and so punished. Before his death his disciples that thought him to bee God seeing him draw towards death, hee resolutely sayd vn∣to them, bee not amazed, I goe to beginne to shew my power. Christ my predecessor (to shew his power) rose again the third day, and I to shew my greater glory will rise againe at three yeares. O horrible blasphemy! The Magistrate beeing throughly informed of his life and doctrine cau∣sed his processe to be drawn after his death, &amp; by a sentence his body was taken out of the ground, and iustice done as if he had bin aliue; his goods being confiscated, &amp; his books burnt: some of his followers acknowledged &amp; abiured their errors. and imbracing again the reformed religion were with al courtesie and gentlenesse pardoned, and the whole history of it set forth in print, both in lattin and dutch to the view of the world.

<P>THere hath bin much dispute and great diuer∣sity of opinions about the deriuation of this name of <HI>Leyden,</HI> but I will content my selfe that <HI>Ptolemy</HI> called it <HI>Lugdunum Battauorum, &amp; Antoni∣nus</HI> in his Itinerary or guide for waies to <HI>Rome,</HI> cals it <HI>Lugdunum Caput Germanorum,</HI> the head cit∣ty of the <HI>Germaines,</HI> or the first Citty of the <HI>Ro∣maine</HI> Empire, from it beginning his Iourney to <HI>Rome;</HI> concerning the lattin and dutch woord of <HI>Leyden</HI> I will content my selfe with the an∣tient vse, for that many learned lattin Authors haue also called it <HI>Leyda;</HI> bee it as it may, yet this is most certayne that it hath beene here-to-fore a towne of great importance, for the <HI>Ro∣main Praetor</HI> that gouerned that quarter kept al∣waies his residence and garrison in that towne; and the historyes of <HI>Holland</HI> recount that from

<P>To conclude there are in this towne 145 brid∣ges, an hundreth and foure built of free stone, and the rest of wood: It is one of the six chiefe townes of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the fourth in prehemi∣nence and suffrage: It is the cheefe for that quar∣ter of <HI>Rind-Land,</HI> hauing vnder it 49. townes and villages, the most part of which bring their commodities thether (as butter, milke, cheese, lard, foule, fruites and other necessaryes) to bee sold in the Market, abounding in all thinges else that the earth may bring forth, and sufficiently stored with fish, the Sea be∣ing not aboue a league from it and compassed with many fresh waters.

<P>ALthough the Historiographers do dispute much about the name of this town, some say∣ing that it came frō a Lady so called, heretofore inheritrix of it, others from the golden leaues where-with the Steeple of their church was co∣uered
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
to shew their ritches and magnificence: for <HI>Goude</HI> in the dutch tongue signifies gold, yet it seemes to me most probable, that it is deriued frō a certain water called <HI>Goude,</HI> beginning from the sluce of <HI>Goude</HI> neere vnto <HI>Alphen,</HI> where hereto∣fore the <HI>Romains</HI> had their abode, calling it <HI>Castra Albiniana,</HI> running euen to the riuers of <HI>Yssule,</HI> vppon the which at the entry of that water is the said town built. It is a strong town, populous and pleasant, enuironed with goodly feelds &amp; farmes, strong wals and deep ditches, and within beauti∣fully furnished with faire houses, but especially vppon both sides of the hauen and the Market place: Abounding in all sorts of victuals by reasō of their commodious situation, and the continual passing of such infinite number of shippes, where∣by they haue this aduantage, by reason of their ri∣uers and chanels, that they may victual thē-selues and serue the Prouinces of <HI>Holland, Zealand, Bra∣bant</HI> &amp; others, the greatest part of their wealth cōming in by that meanes. The aire by reason it is far from the Sea is more healthsome then any o∣ther part of the Prouince; there runs a chanell of fresh-water through euery streete of the towne, by reason whereof (here-tofore) there hath beene in this towne 305.

commodity from them. It hath a faire and spatious Market place in an Ouall forme, and in the middest thereof a great and magnificent State-house, which the Lady <HI>Iaquelin</HI> Countesse of <HI>Holland</HI> caused to be built, when at the pursuit of <HI>Phillip</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgondy</HI> (being abandoned by almost all the townes of <HI>Holland)</HI> shee was forced to retyre to the Castle of this towne; yet not∣withstanding it seemes this State house was fini∣shed after her death, in the yeare of our Lord 1440. I haue seene at the <HI>Hage</HI> a chaire of wood, vpon the backe whereof their were two <HI>A. A.</HI> in gold, and these words Trou aen din. These two <HI>A.

<P>The freedome and iurisdiction of this Towne at the beginning was no more then the com∣passe of it within the portes and walls, with very little land without, but was afterward in the yeare of our Lord 1484. much amplified by the Emperour <HI>Maximillian</HI> the first, and the Arch-duke <HI>Philip</HI> his sonne▪ with at least a league of land in compasse on both sides the riuer of <HI>Yssell.</HI></P>

<P>ABout the yeare 1316. in the time of Count <HI>William</HI> the third of that name called the good Earle of <HI>Holland, Zeeland, Henault</HI> and <HI>West∣freezeland</HI> this towne tooke his little beginning in this manner: When the towne of <HI>Veronne</HI> neere <HI>Alckmar</HI> was destroyed by the <HI>Frisons,</HI> there was a great sluce in the ditch where at this day
<PB N="90" REF="50"/>
the market place of the sayd towne stands which was called <HI>Roestein</HI> by the which the country peo∣ple entred into the sea with their barkes. It happe∣ned that three brothers cittizens of <HI>Hambourgh</HI> came and went thither with shippes laden with beere, who caused three high houses of stone to be built there for the <HI>Frisons,</HI> for the <HI>Danes</HI> came thi∣ther ordinarily with oxen, kine, horses and other marchandise, passing the sea with their little ships, from the <HI>Cimbrique Chersonesus,</HI> or the country of <HI>Holstein,</HI> so that from time to time by little and little it began to augment in buildings, &amp; first be∣came a village, afterwardes a towne, and at last a good city: one of these three houses remained en∣tire 220. years after, vntill the yeare 1430. The o∣ther two beeing ruined were built againe but not with so great stones as this third.</P>
<P>There is some diuersity of opinion about the e∣tymology of the name of <HI>Horne,</HI> which signifies as well a hunters horne as otherwise, some say it is of the hauen of the towne that turnes in forme of a little horne; others say that this same place was full of bogges, where now the ditches and walls of the towne are, and that there grew there cer∣taine plants in great quantity in forme of a horne, the which beeing cut either aboue or below one might winde as of a cornet.</P>
<P>The streete of the said towne that is called the <HI>New Dam,</HI> where the woodmongers and shooma∣kers dwell, and where the turue boats arriue was
<PB N="91" REF="50"/>
made in the time of the Count <HI>William</HI> when there was not water inough without the Sluce of <HI>Horne,</HI> but that the great shippes of <HI>Denmarke</HI> and <HI>Ham∣bourge</HI> were forced to stay at the sea ditch, and therefore they caused a little long ditch to bee made which they called the <HI>New Dam,</HI> beginning at the great ditch a good distance from the mouth of the sea, from whence they brought their hor∣ses and oxen to the towne. All this is now with∣in the towne; fairely built, and called the <HI>New Damme.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeare of our Lord 1350. Duke <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Bauaria</HI> the sonne of the Emperour <HI>Lodowick</HI> and <HI>Marguerite</HI> Countesse of <HI>Holland</HI> gaue to the Burgeses of <HI>Horne</HI> as large and ample priuiled∣ges as they had giuen to them of <HI>Medenblick</HI> which to this day they enioy. There is a streete in the said towne called <HI>Heer Gerits Landt</HI> so cal∣led of <HI>Gerard</HI> of <HI>Hemskerke</HI> who caused a faire house to bee built in a large garden now full of houses, the which <HI>Gerard</HI> died in the sayd towne in the yeare of our Lord 1398. after hee had ser∣ued Duke <HI>Albert</HI> in his wars against the <HI>Frisons.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of the Lady <HI>Iaqueline</HI> Countesse of <HI>Holland</HI> &amp;c. certaine townes of <HI>West-Freesland</HI> re∣belled against her, and called in <HI>Philippe</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundie</HI> the Sonne of her Aunt, vnwilling to bee gouerned any longer by a woman, where∣vpon grew great warres, the <HI>Kennemers</HI> taking part with their Princesse and making warres

against the <HI>Waterlanders,</HI> and <HI>East Frisons,</HI> the <HI>Hor∣nois</HI> by reason of their ritches and great traffick that they had from North to South, being growne proud.</P>
<P>It happened at this time that a young man of the said towne, the sonne of one of the cheefest mar∣chants called <HI>Ian Lambrechts Cruyf,</HI> being in the towne of <HI>Goude,</HI> where the Countesse <HI>Iaqueline</HI> kept her residence, seeing the said Countesse passe by, said, without thinking any hurt: <HI>It is great pit∣ty and shame to vse so noble a Dame in this sort, as if she were a common woman.</HI></P>
<P>These words were worse taken then they were meant. Where-vpon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hee was committed to pri∣son. <HI>Lambert Cruyff</HI> hearing of his sonnes re∣straint, posted thether with a good summe of money to redeeme him. Hauing treated with the Iudges, and presented this money, they gaue him good words, telling him that his sonne should not dye, but should be onely lead to the place of exe∣cution: Whereas the executioner drawing out his sword, the Countesse should crye out, which should cause the heads-man to staye, and so his sonne should bee freed.</P>
<P>The father was somewhat comforted with this answer, and seeing there was no other meanes, hee recommended the cause vnto God. The sonne being vpon the Scaffold, and the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ecutioner ha∣uing drawne his sword, the Countesse made no shew of crying out, so as this poore young
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>
man was vniustly executed, wherewith the father being much moued, he sayed vnto himselfe, being vnderstood by some other. <HI>Thou shalt not remaine Contesse of Holland neither shalt thou hereafter en∣io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that Country in peace.</HI> And therevpon he retur∣ned with his money to his owne house. Beeing come to <HI>Horne</HI> hee acquainted the Magistrates and the Bourgers with the wrong which the Con∣tesse had done vnto his sonne, in the towne of <HI>Goude,</HI> wherevpon a councell was held of all the chiefe of the towne, who concluded ioyntly neuer more to acknowledge her for their Princesse, and to fortefie themselues against her. The father of this young man that was executed, full of discon∣tent and desire of reuenge, did giue or lend a great sum of money, to beginne the fortification of the towne.</P>
<P>And this beeing in the yeare 1427. they began to compasse in this towne with goodly walls and deepe and large ditches. Doctor <HI>Adrianus Iunius</HI> (a curious sercher out of Antiquities, as appeeres by his history of <HI>Battauia)</HI> was borne in that town, sonne to <HI>Peter de Iouge</HI> a Bourguemaster. This towne abounds with all sorts of victualls, halfe of it all along the sea, is defended with good palissa∣does, and banks, made of a small grasse which they call <HI>Vlyer,</HI> in Latin <HI>Alga,</HI> wherewith most of the bankes in that quarter of <HI>Westfrisland</HI> are armed, for that it settles close together, and doth not rot in a long time, and being rotten it becomes firme

earth. They gather shippes ladings of this grasse in a certaine season of the yeare, in the sea about the Island of <HI>Wyeringhe,</HI> from the which it is nam∣ed, and they keepe great heaps thereof in store, to repaire their bankes at neede when as they are any way decaied. It is strange that is reported of this herbe, that wild swannes at a lowe water pull it out of the botome of the sea, the which floting vpon the water, staies in a certaine place, whereas they goe to gather it. This Island of <HI>Wyeringhe</HI> is not farre from that of <HI>Texel,</HI> nor consequently from <HI>Enchuysen, Medenbilck</HI> nor <HI>Horne,</HI> the which besides all other delights which it yeelds, brings forth aboundance of great Skirrit rootes, as delicate a meate as can bee presented before a King, wherein <HI>Plinie</HI> reports that the Emperor <HI>Tiberius</HI> did so delight, as hee caused them to bee brought out of <HI>Germanie</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

But I cannot but lament, that so many great, no∣ble, riche and mightie families, are now extinct, as well by their intestine warres against the <HI>Frisons,</HI> as against strangers; for which consideration the heyres males fayling, the successions fell to the women, and so came to other families: besides the furie of <HI>Gerard van Velsen</HI> had many companions, all which were put to death, and their neerest kins∣men pursued to the death, euen vnto the ninth de∣gree (a most cruell reuenge) and such as could escape, were forced to become vagabonds in for∣raine countries, such as had hidden themselues vn∣till this furious reuenge was past, were afterwards forced to take borrowed names of other families, and to leaue their owne. To come then to that which remaines, and to those which are past. We will say that the house of <HI>Wassenare</HI> (as wee haue said else-where) was the most ancient of <HI>Holland:</HI> as it appeares by this common prouerbe <HI>Vassenare the most ancient;</HI> Brederode <HI>the most noble</HI> (for that they descend from the first Earles) <HI>and</HI> Egmond <HI>the most rich.</HI> Wee haue scene in this last age, <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Wasenare,</HI> the subduer of the <HI>Frisons,</HI> a braue and valiant Knight, who was slaine in those warres leauing one onely daughter and heire, married to the Earle of <HI>Lingue,</HI> whereby this familie and sur∣name is extinct.</P>
<P>The memorie of the house of <HI>Brederode</HI> may easily be found in the Annales of <HI>Holland,</HI> being come from <HI>Ziphard</HI> the second sonne of <HI>Arnulph</HI>

the third Earle of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> who to a∣uoyd his fathers wrath, retyred into <HI>Freezeland,</HI> and there without his priuity he marryed the Po∣testats daughter of the country, by whome hee had two sonnes, <HI>Thierry</HI> and <HI>Simon:</HI> Being afterwards reconciled to his Father, he had certaine land alot∣ted him for his portion, which was measured by the great rod, the which in the country language is <HI>Brederode,</HI> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om whence they tooke their name.

<P>The beginning of the house of <HI>Egmont</HI> is doubtfull, for the Lordes thereof cannot truly shewe a continuance of their descent for three hundred yeares: yet they say they are issued from
<PB N="139" REF="74"/>
<HI>Radbod</HI> (I know not which) King of the <HI>Frisons,</HI> but I thinke it would bee a tedious thing to finde out this pedigree. Such as contradict it say, that they are descended from a Receiuer of the Abbay of <HI>Egmond,</HI> which Office had beene called <HI>Aduoe,</HI> and vnder this title hauing inrich∣ed them-selues with the goods of this Abbaie, by little and little they attained to great wealth, and thereby to great allyances, which haue aug∣mented their house, as well in possessions, as degrees of honour, so as in the end they marry∣ed a daughter of the famous house of <HI>Arckel,</HI> the which was heire to the Dutchie of <HI>Geldres:</HI> Whereas <HI>Arnold</HI> of <HI>Egmond</HI> the first Duke of that house, had one sonne called <HI>Adolph,</HI> who did much trouble his father, yea hee detained him in prison, vntill that <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Bur∣gongne</HI> sette him free. <HI>Adolph</HI> retyring into <HI>France,</HI> marryed a Lady of the house of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> who hauing one son named <HI>Charles▪</HI> hee was after∣terwards slaine being Generall of the <HI>Ganthois</HI> be∣fore <HI>Tournay:</HI> After whose death the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift vnder coullor of some transport which hee pretended, that Duke <HI>Arnold</HI> had made vnto duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Burgongne</HI> beeing in dislike with his son, hee seazed vppon the whole Duchy: but <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Egmond,</HI> sonne to Prince <HI>Adolph</HI> (for he was neuer Duke) with the helpe of the Princes of the house of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> who stirred vp the <HI>French</HI> King, returning into his Countrie
<PB N="140" REF="75"/>
hee was receiued and acknowledged for Duke in many townes, &amp; the Emperors men chased away. Afterwards (being of a turbulent spirit) hee had great warres, so as in the end hee dyed, about the yeare 1536. without any children, and in him fai∣led the distrect lyne of this house of <HI>Egmond:</HI> The Seignieury of <HI>Egmond</HI> falling to the yonger house who was father to <HI>Iohn</HI> the first Earle of <HI>Egmond,</HI> which <HI>Iohn</HI> had one brother <HI>Maximliā</HI> of <HI>Egmond,</HI> Earle of <HI>Buren,</HI> Lord of <HI>Iselsteine,</HI> whose daughter being issued of a Lady of the house of <HI>Launoy</HI> and the onely heire, marryed with <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> so as the possessions of these two houses of <HI>Buren</HI> and <HI>Launoy</HI> are discended to Prince <HI>Philip</HI> eldest son to the deceased Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as wel by his grandfather, as by his father.</P>
<P>Some do account next among the most ancient and Noble families, that of <HI>Vander Merwue</HI> as des∣cended from <HI>Merouee</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> in honour of whome some beleeue that in that place the riuer of <HI>Wahall</HI> was changed into <HI>Meruwe:</HI> but this Original is farre fetcht: There is yet some remainder of a Tower in the midst of <HI>Meruve,</HI> which in old time was the place where they payed toll, the which is now receiued in <HI>Dordrect,</HI> whereas the Baron of <HI>Meruve,</HI> who is also Lord of <HI>Aspren,</HI> hath one day in the yeare all right of superiority and power to pardon murthers and al other offences. The house of <HI>Arckel</HI> did for a long time command insolently in the Earldome of <HI>Teysterbandt,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Wa∣hal</HI>

and the <HI>Leck,</HI> the which the riuer of <HI>Linge</HI> doth crosse, and passing through <HI>Gorichom</HI> it fals into the <HI>Meruve.</HI> In this County there are many other Townes then <HI>Gorichom</HI> with the Castle; as <HI>Leerdam, Henkelom, Haerstricht, Aspren, Euersteyn, Hagesteyn,</HI> and <HI>Gasprien,</HI> wherof the three last and <HI>Haarstrecht</HI> haue beene burnt and ruined: It seemes that all the neighbour Princes haue conspired against this house for their great pride: For <HI>Frederick</HI> Bishop of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> hauing taken <HI>Gaspren, Hagestein</HI> and <HI>Euer∣steyn,</HI> he ruined them quite. The Lord of <HI>Vianen</HI> wrested <HI>Rhynstein</HI> from him. <HI>Arnold</HI> Duke of <HI>Gel∣dres</HI> tooke <HI>Leerdam</HI> and <HI>Steenvoerd. Albert</HI> Duke <HI>Bauaria</HI> Earle of <HI>Holland</HI> took <HI>Haestrecht</HI> from him and ruined it. Afterwards the said Duke bought of <HI>Iohn</HI> the last Lord of so many townes, and Seigieu∣ries, that of <HI>Gorichom,</HI> with consent of his sonne, and vnder his hand writing, who notwithstanding soone after disavowed the contract, the which hee brake after his fathers death, and found meanes to surprize the said towne. The Countesse <HI>Iaqueline</HI> went thether with an armie, besieged it, and took it by assault, whereas the said young Lord receiued the reward of his disloyalty, for he was slain there: These Lords of <HI>Arckel</HI> were so mighty, as besides the County of <HI>Teysterband</HI> (in the which are the townes aboue mentioned) they had liuing in <HI>Bra∣bant, Lembourg, Bar, Vtrecht, Geldre, Holland</HI> and <HI>Ze∣land,</HI> which possessions made them proud, arro∣gant &amp; hatefull vnto their neighbours, ouer whom
<PB N="142" REF="76"/>
they did insult, vntill they came to the end which we haue spoken of.</P>
<P>The house of <HI>Batenbourg</HI> is without al question one of the most ancient: taking their name from Prince <HI>Batto,</HI> from whome <HI>Battauia</HI> is come whereof there were of great fame for their ver∣tue some fiue hundred yeares since, <HI>Albert, Rodol∣phus</HI> and <HI>Thierry</HI> Lordes of <HI>Battenbourg,</HI> as of late <HI>Thierry, G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sbercht,</HI> and <HI>VVilliam,</HI> who beeing Lieutenant to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> leading an army to victuall <HI>Harlem,</HI> beseeged by the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> was defeated by the Spaniards: This Towne of <HI>Battenbourg</HI> was afterwards burnt, and the Castell held long by the <HI>Spaniardes.</HI> The sayd <HI>Ghisbrecht</HI> had besides <HI>William</HI> three other sons, wherof one was traiterously slayne at <HI>Col∣logne, Ghisbrecht</HI> and <HI>Thierry</HI> beeing taken priso∣ners in the Warre by the Earle of <HI>Arembergh,</HI> hee deliuered them to the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> who caused their heades to bee cutte off at <HI>Brusselles,</HI> with other Gentlemen of their religion: But it was not long before this Earle receiued his due punishment, for before a yeare past hee was slayne in Battaile in the same Countrie where hee falsified his faith to these two young Ba∣rons.</P>
<P>The race of the Lordes of <HI>Harlem</HI> is also very ancient, and noble, who they say tooke their be∣ginning from the Kinges of <HI>Freezeland,</HI> which had built the Castell of <HI>Harlem</HI> according to
<PB N="143" REF="76"/>
their name in the yeare a thousand sixe hundred. The ruines of this Castell are yet to bee seene not farre from <HI>Hemskerke.</HI> It appeares by the Annales of <HI>Holland</HI> that one <HI>Isbrandt</HI> of the house of <HI>Harlem,</HI> did accompany the Ladie <HI>So∣phia</HI> Princesse of <HI>Holland,</HI> and Prince <HI>Otto</HI> her yon∣gest sonne in a Pilgrimage which they made through deuotion vnto <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Some Knights of this house vnfortunate in the warre against the <HI>Frisons,</HI> haue lost their liues there. Of this house was <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Harlem</HI> knight, who conuerted a faire house which he had within the wals of the towne, into a Cloyster of <HI>Carmelites,</HI> in the yeare 1249.</P>
<P>Of which house by changing of the name, they of the house of <HI>Assendelfe</HI> haue obtained the inheritance and the Armes vnto this daie. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Lord of <HI>Assendelfe</HI> was wont to say, that his father hauing built the Castell of <HI>Assenburch,</HI> had repented him a hundred times that hee had not set it vppon the ruines of the Castell of <HI>Har∣lem,</HI> to preserue the honour of antiquitie. This house of <HI>Assendelfe</HI> takes his name from the Vil∣lage which is richer, the which in ancient time (as at appeares by old Charters) was called <HI>As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣maundelfe.</HI></P>

<P>We read that the house of <HI>Heusden</HI> (where there is a towne and Castle) is issued some eight hundred yeares since from the Earles of <HI>Cleues,</HI> hauing car∣ryed the armes as well of <HI>Edmond</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> whose daughter <HI>Baldwin</HI> Lord of <HI>Heusden</HI> stole a∣way and marryed her, who hauing many children by her, would haue his nephewes to carry a wheele of <HI>Geules</HI> in a field <HI>Or.</HI> The reason was that when as the King of <HI>Englands</HI> seruants sent to seeke his daughter, came to the Lord of <HI>Heusdins,</HI> they foūd her spinning at the wheele, with some pretty chil∣dren about her, which brought her into fauour againe. Since the yeare 1290. the Earle of <HI>Cleues</HI> resigned all the interest he had to the Lordships of <HI>Heusden</HI> and <HI>Altena,</HI> to <HI>Floris</HI> the sixt Earle of <HI>Hol∣land</HI> to hold them of him in fee; but this resignati∣on did not hold long; for the Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> came and fell vppon <HI>Heusden,</HI> and became maister of it, but he held it as little, for Count <HI>VVilliam</HI> of <HI>Bauaria)</HI> being a mediator betwixt the duke of <HI>Bra∣bāt</HI> &amp; the Earle of <HI>Flanders)</HI> dealt first for himselfe in such sort, as hee should haue <HI>Heusdē</HI> the which hath bin annexed to this day to the conty of <HI>Hollād.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="146" REF="78"/>
The house of <HI>Polanen</HI> (as wee haue euen now sayd) is issued from that of <HI>Duyuenvoorde,</HI> but it was of small continuance: for <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord of <HI>Po∣lanen</HI> hauing left one onely sonne called also <HI>Iohn,</HI> hee dyed without any heires male, leauing one daughter, the sole heire of <HI>Polanen,</HI> of <HI>Lecce</HI> and of <HI>Breda,</HI> the which shee brought in marriage to <HI>Engelbert</HI> Earle of <HI>Nassau,</HI> who was the first Gouernor of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> for the La∣die <HI>Mary</HI> Dutchesse of Bourgogne, so as the sayd Siegneuries doe at this day belong vnto the children of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassau</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>That of <HI>Naeldwyck</HI> was not of much longer contynuance, whereof wee finde that one <HI>Baldwin</HI> a Knight, Gouernor of the castle of <HI>Windenesse</HI> in <HI>Westfrisland,</HI> a league from <HI>Horne,</HI> carried him∣selfe valiantlie, vntill that for want of victualls and all other necessarie prouision, hee was for∣ced to yeelde vppe the place. Those of that house conuerted their goodly castle of <HI>Wateringhe</HI> into a Monasterie, which was ruined in these last warres.</P>
<P>I will make but one house of those of <HI>Woude</HI> and of <HI>Warmont,</HI> for that the Siegnor of <HI>Woude</HI> tooke more delight at <HI>Warmont,</HI> which stands in a good ayre and in a goodly country, then in the castle of <HI>Woude</HI> which stands in a Moore, so as the castle of <HI>Woude</HI> being neglected it fell to decay, and that of <HI>Warmont</HI> florished.</P>
<P>This house of <HI>Warmont</HI> was wont to beare in a field

<HI>Or</HI> three <HI>Lozenges Geules,</HI> vntill that <HI>Thierry</HI> of <HI>Wassenare,</HI> Vicont of <HI>Leyden,</HI> giuing the possession of certaine Lands in the yeare of our Lord 1359. to <HI>Iames</HI> the foureteenth Lord of <HI>Warmont,</HI> hee suffred him to carrie his owne Armes, which is a band <HI>Or</HI> vpon a field <HI>Azure</HI> betwixt three Croi∣sants <HI>Argent,</HI> which that house carries vnto this daie. But those of that house beeing partakers of the furie of <HI>Gerard van Velsen,</HI> the murtherer of Count <HI>Floris</HI> the fifth, they were for the safe-gard of their liues forced to abandon the countrie.

<P>Those of <HI>Poelgeest</HI> are also of a famous race the which in olde time had a castle of the same name in the quarter of <HI>Oestgeest,</HI> the village whereof was called <HI>Kerkwerve,</HI> the which by changing of the name, is now called <HI>Alcmada,</HI> I know not by what title.

<P>There haue bene in <HI>Holland</HI> many Abbaies, and Monasteries, both of men and women, founded by the Nobilitie of the country, besides Couents of begging Fryars or Bribers, which wee will omit; and treat succinctly of those which were appoin∣ted for Noble persons. First <HI>Thierry</HI> of <HI>Acquitane,</HI> the first Earle of <HI>Holland</HI> founded one all of wood for women: the which his son caused to be built of stone for Monkes, and bee made an Abbaie neere vnto the Village of <HI>Egmond</HI> (whereof the Abbot did afterwards weare a Miter) inricht with great reuenues, which made both the Abbot and his Monkes too idle. And seeing wee are discoursing of this Abbaie, I must by the way deliuer a tricke which this Abbot plaid in the yeare 1565. with the Earle of <HI>Egmond:</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Horne</HI> and the Baron of <HI>Brederode</HI> went with the Earle of <HI>Egmont</HI> to dine in this Abbaie,
<PB N="154" REF="82"/>
where they were very honourablie entertained, when as they shoulde wash, my Lord Abbot (who was but a Monke) tooke these three Noble men by the handes to wash: The Earle of <HI>Egmond</HI> comming to present him-selfe, the Abbot sayd vnto him; No, for you are my Vassall, it becomes you not to wash with your better, yea he offred to put the towell vppon his shoulder, to giue it vnto the other Noblemen, when they had washt, whereat the Earle of <HI>Egmond</HI> was much discon∣tented, and went away cursing the Monke. One of the Abbots seruantes, who was then present, reported it vnto mee for a very truth. VVithout doubt it was a great affront vnto this Earle, who was proude and high minded, valuing him-selfe more then the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was issued from the race of the Emperours, by the Emperor <HI>Adolph</HI> of <HI>Nassau.</HI></P>
<P>There were foure Abbaies for women, into the which not any one might be receiued, that was not Nobly borne, or at the least that had not their Armes quartered. These were <HI>Rhinsburg; Conninxsfieldt, Leuenhorst</HI> and <HI>Losdunen:</HI> this last in the end had little respect of Nobilitie, receiuing as well the children of Marchants as of Gentlemen, for that it was none of the richest: <HI>Rhinsburg</HI> tooke the name of a Castell which was situated vppon the <HI>Rhyne</HI> neere vnto the <HI>Gulph:</HI> It was pleasantly sea∣ted, &amp; a very commodious building. There is this thing memorable, that the Ladie <HI>Elburg</HI> the Ab∣besse,
<PB N="155" REF="82"/>
caused a quarter of a lodging to be built for strangers that shoulde come to see it. Vppon the Front whereof there were two Latin verses, made by Doctor <HI>Adrianus Iunius,</HI> shewing the date of the time.</P>

<P>There is no neede then to make anie further search for the <HI>Etimologie,</HI> but wee will content our selues with it.

<P>Those of <HI>Walchren</HI> and <HI>Schouen</HI> lye most open to the sea on the West part, on which side they be na∣turally defended with these sandie hils which they call Downes; and where there are not any, they haue made good and high bankes, strengthned with thicke turffes and wads of straw, which binde them firmely together, the which they call dikes: True it is that the ordinary charge to repaire and entertaine them, is very great, and the time and toyle they imploy greater. But they obserue a good order, with such proportion, as such as haue the propriety of the land adioyning, beare the charge for the entertaining of these dikes, euery one according to his portion.

Within these twelue yeares they haue augmented their Towne more then halfe round about, wherin they haue done preiudice without any recompence to them that had gardens and possessions in the Suburbs: yet all this great increase serues for no other vse but for houses of pleasure and gardens for Marchants, although there were place to haue built aboue 3000. good houses, for the cōmoditie whereof they might make many chanels to passe frō the one to the other: but God knowes when al this voide place shall bee filled with buildings.</P>
<P>The rampars of these new workes are but of earth, with mightie bulwarks flanking one ano∣ther, where there is alwaies something to repaire.

<P>SO called by the name of the Lord <HI>Wolphart,</HI> as much to say, as the <HI>Dyck</HI> of <HI>Wolphart;</HI> it is the least of all these Islands aboue mentioned, in the which there are but three villages, <HI>Wolfers Dyck, Sabbinghe</HI> and <HI>Hogersdyck,</HI> but there is good pasture for cattel, the Inhabitants being most giuen to fishing.</P>
<P>There are moreouer in <HI>Zeeland</HI> some other small <HI>Islands,</HI> which are daily recouered from the sea, rise∣ing first like bankes of sand, so as seeing them thus rise by little and little and to beare grasse, they send their sheepe ouer to feede there, whereas the she∣pards haue little lodges, and for their cattell they make great barnes or stables, where they lie drie in foule weather, and there the owners prouide them haye before winter.</P>
<P>It seemes also that these Islands of <HI>Zeeland</HI> haue beene recouered from the sea, long before <HI>Charles Martel</HI> Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> father to King <HI>Pepinne</HI> of <HI>France:</HI> wherein the <HI>Danes</HI> laboured much, who in those daies had continual war against the <HI>French</HI> and great <HI>Brittanie:</HI> for they did choose these sand∣hills, as a safe retreat for their Incursions vpon the neighbour countries, which they made their <HI>Ren∣dezvous,</HI> making it the magasin of their spoiles. First they seazed vpon the Isle of <HI>Walchren,</HI> the which they did fortefie as well as they could against the violence of the sea: before which enterprise they made many high mounts of earth as are

yet to be seene, heere and there, which remaine vn∣profitable, some neere vnto townes, applied to the vse of Gardens: vnto which mountes (being any ex∣traordinary tide) they did driue their cattel, and re∣tyred thether them-selues, vntill the waters haue falne, and then they returned to their lodgings. These <HI>Danes</HI> or <HI>Noortmans</HI> hauing thus recouered the country, began to Tille it, especially after the descent of their great Captaine Duke <HI>Rollo:</HI> who was head of the <HI>Norman</HI> Nation in <HI>France:</HI> But in the end the <HI>Danes</HI> being expelled out of great <HI>Brit∣taine,</HI> they were chased also out of these Ilandes: the which in succession of time were peopled and made ciuill: And so after many Accidents, reuolutions &amp; quarrels in these watery parts, in the end they were by force made subiect to the Earles of <HI>Holland,</HI> be∣ing giuen vnto them long before, &amp; made a Coun∣ty by the Emperour <HI>Lewis</HI> the gentle: as the Empe∣ror <HI>Charles</HI> the bald his father had made <HI>Holland</HI> a County and giuen it to <HI>Thierry</HI> the first Lord of these two Earldomes.

which defeat (as histories report) there were fifty thousand <HI>Flemings</HI> slaine, as many drowned, and almost as many prisoners, whom the victors intrea∣ted ignominiously, stripping thē naked: among the prisoners were the two Commaunders, <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Dompierre,</HI> sonnes to the Contesse <HI>Margue∣rite;</HI> with <HI>Thybault</HI> Earle of <HI>Guise, Geffrie</HI> Earle of <HI>Bar,</HI> and aboue 230. Noble men, Knights and men of accoumpt: King <HI>William</HI> being puft vppe with this victory, hauing such prisoners, would not giue eare to any conditions of peace, but such as he pro∣pounded to the Contesse, which shee would not yeeld vnto. But the King beeing slaine two yeares after in <HI>Freezeland,</HI> a peace was made betwixt the Contesse and <HI>Floris</HI> Brother to the deceased King, Vncle and Gardien to his sonne, who was Earle of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> named <HI>Florens</HI> the fift.

After that the <HI>Wiltes</HI> had taken and ruined it, they built a Fort which they call <HI>Wiltenbourg,</HI> the which was taken by <HI>Da∣gobert</HI> sonne to <HI>Clotaire</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who did for∣tifie it more then before, and called it <HI>Traiectum,</HI> for it was a trauers or passage whereas an Impost was paid (which in many places in <HI>France</HI> they call <HI>Le droit de Travers,</HI> the due or right of trauers or passage) for all Marchandise, that was carryed and recarried on either side: and it retaines at this day the name of <HI>Traiectum.</HI> It standes vppon the head of the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> the which past directly there, before that they forced it (in making a Scluse

King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> being vppon the place, he tooke a wonderful delight. And it is most certaine that there were some Noblemen which layed great wagers for the tryal thereof, and found it true. Moreouer in one of the longest daies in Summer, if one parts early in a morning from <HI>V∣trecht,</HI> he may dine at any one of 26. townes, where he please, &amp; return to his own house to supper: the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. in the yeare 1542. caused a castle to bee built neere vnto S. <HI>Catherins</HI> port, to keep the town in awe, when as by the cession of the Bishop of that place, he was put in temporal posses∣sion of the said town &amp; the dependances: the which hee called <HI>Vredenbourg,</HI> that is to say a Castle of peace. The Cittie is great &amp; mighty, wel fortified with ten good Bulwarks flanking one another, with their counterscarps and diches al of Masons work, and the rampars in like manner: some Bulwarks are also of stone, the rest only of earth: there are goodly buildings, furnished with caues &amp; vauted sellers.</P>

There are also goodly churches, among the which there are fiue, that haue chanoins: The first which is the cathedrall church, is called Saint <HI>Martins,</HI> the second Saint <HI>Sauiour</HI> neere vnto it, but now pulled downe: the 3. Saint <HI>Peter</HI> the 4. Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> and the 5. of our Ladies, founded by the Emperor <HI>Frederic Barberossa,</HI> hauing bin enioyned therevnto by the Pope, to expiate the fault which he had committed in ruining the towne and all the churches and mo∣nasteries of <HI>Milan:</HI> But aboue all, the cathedrall church is stately, hauing a faire high goodly tower, transparent: in the which the sayd Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. did celebrate the order of the golden fleece, in the yeare 1546. the old temple was pulled down by the bishop <HI>Adelbold,</HI> for that he held it to bee too little, and did reedefie it in the estate we now see it. This new temple was consecrated in the yeare 1023. in the presence of the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the 2. by 12. bishops.

There were also three of gentlewomen without the town, but these last warres haue beene the cause of their ruine, fearing to leaue lodgings for their enemies, beeing to neere the towne, but the Nunnes enioye their entertainement; and when any Monke or Nunne dies, the Estates of the Prouince put others in their places, to ease the poorer sort of the gen∣trie.

<P>IT appeeres by the ancient Histories, that this towne of <HI>Wyck-ter-Duyrsted,</HI> hath in ancient time beene a great and spatious towne, in the which they write were 32. parish churches. It was before this towne that the <HI>Rhine</HI> was dambde vp, and forced (some 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. yeares since) to leaue his right course and to cast it selfe into the Lecke, as we haue shew∣ed before. But they set not downe the cause why
<PB N="207" REF="108"/>
they cut it off in this place, and made it take the course it now holds. The which happened, for that when as the winde was at the Norwest, and blew hard, the riuer of <HI>Rhine</HI> being driuen backe, and not able to passe out by his gulfe at <HI>Catwyck</HI> into the British sea, was forced to disperce it selfe ouer all the conntries of <HI>Holland, Vtrecht</HI> and the <HI>Betuve,</HI> which is of the Dutchy of <HI>Geldres.</HI> The which hap∣pened often, whereby they sustained great losses, wherfore the Estates of these 3. Prouinces assemb∣ling together, they consulted how they might pre∣uēt it, &amp; in the end resolued to turne the <HI>Rhine</HI> from his right course, which was to the Norwest, and to giue it an other, which shold fall, crokedly into the sea, as it doth at this present: for the effecting wher∣of they dambd it vp, drawing it by little &amp; little in∣to the Lecke which is nere vnto it making high bancks of either side, so as in succession of time it is become a good nauigable riuer, falling into the <HI>Meuse</HI> beneath <HI>Dordrecht,</HI> and so enters into the Ocean sea before <HI>Bryele.</HI> This towne of <HI>Wyck</HI> is verie ancient; Whereon <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> a Knight and <HI>Romaine</HI> Historiographer makes hono∣rable mention, calling it <HI>Batauodurum.</HI> It was ruined by the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> but afterwards built againe: yet nothing so bigge as at the first, notwithstanding it hath alwaies beene, as it is at this present, for the commoditie of the situa∣tion▪, a good and a ritch towne, hauing a verie strong castle, whereas the Princes, Bishoppes of

Three daies after the bishop entred, and caused some of the mutines to bee executed by the sword, yea he made two chanoins to bee put in∣to a sack and cast into the riuer, and he would haue taken a sharper reuenge without the intercession of the Earle of <HI>Hochstraten:</HI> eight daies after he assēb∣led the three Estates in the publick place, by the which he was acknowledged to bee their bishop &amp; Prince, all sollemnly swearing fidelity &amp; obedience vnto him. Afterwards the bishop hauing conferred againe with the said Estates, hee propounded vnto them, how that being in the town of <HI>Schonhouen,</HI> he
<PB N="215" REF="112"/>
had let them vnderstand his resolution to submit the temporalty of his Siegneury to the Emperour, shewing them how necessary it was, for their quiet and publike preseruation, to the end that this Estate being vnder the gard and protection of so mighty a Monarke; it should bee defended and preserued from all enemies which did enuiron it; intreating them to like well of that which he had resolued, and to yeeld vnto it. The matter being diuersly debated after many allegations on either side, in the end (for that they could not auoide it, the Emperors men being already in possession of the town) seeing they had cōmitted an error, and that their oppposition would auaile them nothing, but incense the Empe∣ror &amp; their Prelat, they yeelded vnto it. That is, that the citty of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> with the iurisdiction and lim∣mits of al the townes, villages, borroughes, forts, territory, champian country, mountaines, woods, forests, riuers, pooles, lakes, mills, rents and reue∣nues to conclude all that was of the temporall de∣meins, of the sayd Estate and countrie of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> together with all the right, title and interest, which hee had to the high diocese, that is to say, to the country of <HI>Oueryssel,</HI> and ouer the town of <HI>Groning,</HI> the iurisdiction of the <HI>Groningers</HI> and the <HI>Omelands,</HI> with all their rights, should be vnited and incorpo∣rated to the demeins of the Dukes of <HI>Brabant</HI> and Earles of <HI>Holland.</HI> The which hauing beene a∣greed vpon and concluded, the <HI>Traiectins</HI> were absolued of their othe of fealtie which
<PB N="216" REF="113"/>
they had taken vnto the sayd bishoppe, who freely discharged them, vpon condition that they should take the like othe, and doe homage to the Empe∣rour, and to his lawfull heires issued of his bloud, Dukes of <HI>Brabant</HI> and Earles of <HI>Holland:</HI> The Bi∣shop reseruing nothing for himselfe and his suc∣cessors, but the spirituall iurisdiction and reuenues, and that sumptuos Palace in the towne, ioyning to the cathedrall church, built by <HI>Charles Martel</HI> Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> father to <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who gaue it to <HI>Gregorie</HI> the third Bishop of <HI>Vtrecht.</HI> All things being thus concluded betwixt the Bishoppe <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> and the Emperor; <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Geldres</HI> finding his forces to weake to incoun∣ter so great a Monarke, hee purchased a peace with his Maiesty, the which was concluded the first of October following: And the 21. of Nouember the Earle of <HI>Hochstraten,</HI> as gouernor of <HI>Holland</HI> for the Emperor, was sent by the Ladie <HI>Marguerite</HI> Regent into the sayd towne of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> who tooke a sollemne possession in his Maiesties name (as Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> and Earle of <HI>Holland)</HI> and receiued their othes and homages: the like hee did at <HI>Amersfoort, Wyck-ter-Duyrsted, Renen,</HI> and <HI>Montfort,</HI> (as for the soueraigntie this last towne hauing a particular Lord and Vicont of that place) returning back to <HI>V∣trecht</HI> the chiefe towne of the country; he disposed of the Estate &amp; gouernment. And as al things were well setled vnder the Emperors authority, bishop <HI>Henry</HI> had a desire (for some reasons) to retire into

<HI>Germanie</HI> to his other Bishoppricke of <HI>Wormes</HI> cho∣sing for Bishop &amp; substituting in his place <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Enckwoort</HI> borne at <HI>Boisleduc</HI> Cardinall and Bi∣shop of <HI>Tortone,</HI> as Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> the sixt had beene before hee was Pope, who resigned the said Bishop∣prike vnto him before hee came to the Popedome. This <HI>Enckwoort</HI> was a Courtier at <HI>Rome,</HI> and came not to his Bishoprike of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> (making <HI>Iames Vte∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>engen</HI> his Vicar) vntill he died in the yeare 1533. In the meane time Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the seauenth ha∣uing seene the Contracts and Instruments of the cession and transport made by the Bishop <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bauaria</HI> to the Emperour of the temporaltie of <HI>V∣trecht,</HI> and the appourtenances, hauing had therein the aduice and consent of the Colledge of Cardi∣nals, they did approue and ratifie all, decreeing that this cession and transport should be of force, and take full effect. But for that this Estate and Seig∣nieury is a fee of the Empire, and doth hold of the Imperiall Chamber, the Emperour was forced to demand the Inuestiture of the said Chamber in his owne priuate name, as well for him-selfe as for his successors lawfully descended from him. The which he did easily obtaine. And by this meanes the Cit∣ties, Townes, Territorie and Iurisdiction of the Es∣tate and Seigneiury of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> (which had bene go∣uerned by their proper Princes and Bishops; aboue nine hundred yeare) came vnder the obedience of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and after him to his sonne <HI>Philip</HI> the second King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> Duke of

<HI>Brabant,</HI> Earle of <HI>Holland</HI> &amp;c.

<P>The Estates of which Prouince of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> con∣sist at this day, as in former times, of three mem∣bers; the Clergie of fiue Colledges that haue Cha∣noins, the Nobility, and the townes: Of which Col∣ledges the Deputies are indifferently chosen, to as∣sist daily in their Assemblies, with them of the No∣bility and townes; who haue their Secretaries and other Officers.</P>
<P>This Seigneury of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> hath (as we haue said) a Prouincial Councel, from which at this present there is no appellation, as had bin heretofore to the Imperial Chamber at <HI>Spier,</HI> at such time as it was meerly a member of the Empire: but since that the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. did vnite it to his demaines, excluding the said Imperiall Chamber, hee made it subiect to the great Councel at <HI>Macklyn:</HI> vntil that the Estates of the said country and of <HI>Oueryssel,</HI> ha∣uing within these thirty yeares recouered their li∣bertie, it hath bene discontinued. Notwithstanding in case of remission they may haue their recourse

vnto the Estates of the Prouince; where as the reui∣sion is made by the same Acts: In which Prouincial Councel there is a president, six Councellors, an Attourney general, and a Register. The Chamber of accoumpt, is kept by the colledge of the Estates, wheras the Tresorers as well generall as particular are bound to come and yeeld vp their Accoumpt. The said Seigneury hath also a particular Mynt, as it hath alwaies had; the which is also subiect to the general of the Mynte for the vnited Estates. The gouernment and Religion is generally maintained as in other Prouinces their confederats. There are foure Marshals for the whole Seigneury, euery one of which hauing charge in the quarters that are as∣signed them, where they are to command their Ar∣chers to apprehend all vagabonds and other offen∣ders which they shall meet in the country.

<P>NO man can denie but this <HI>Frison</HI> Nation is very ancient, as it appeares by the ancient greeke and latin writers, as <HI>Strabo, Ptolomey, Plinie,
<PB N="220" REF="115"/>
Tacitus</HI> and others: for it retaines at this day the same seat and the same name, which they gaue them and had before them▪ Seeing that in a manner al o∣ther Nations of <HI>Germany</HI> haue either quit their old abodes, or else haue receiued new names: the which needes no farre fetcht proofes, seeing their neerest neighbours do verifie it. For the names of <HI>Holland, Vtrecht, Ouerissel, Westphalia</HI> and others, were ne∣uer knowne by any of the aboue named Authors: neither was the name of <HI>Geldre</HI> euer in vse (the In∣habitants whereof, and of <HI>Cleues, Iuilliers, Monts, &amp; Berghe</HI> were then called <HI>Sicambres)</HI> but eight hun∣dred seauenty eight yeares after the Natiuitie of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST. That which they now call the country of <HI>Saxony,</HI> was not the abode of the ancient <HI>Saxons,</HI> wherof <HI>Ptolomey</HI> makes men∣tion. So as it is hard for moderne writers to iudge (by reason of the alteratiō of names) if those which be at this present neighbours vnto <HI>Frisland,</HI> bee the same Nations which in ancient time were wont to be, or whether they bee now more remote. But as for the <HI>Frisons</HI> there is no dispute nor doubt, wher∣of to giue more firme and solide reasons both of the name and of the Antiquity, the Reader shal vn∣derstand that the succession of their Princes, the fa∣milies, the foundation of townes, castles and villa∣ges, may in their regard, bee drawne, if not farther, yet with more certainty then any other Nation of <HI>Germany.</HI> The <HI>Danes</HI> although they bee very anci∣ent, and equal touching their beginning with the

<HI>Frisons,</HI> cannot make a true extraction, nor giue a reason of the time, but since their King <HI>Frotho</HI> the third; during whose raigne our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST was borne. The <HI>Franconians</HI> likewise al∣though they bee very old (whatsoeuer they pretend that their freedome was purchased in the seruice of the <HI>Romaine</HI> Emperours) yet are they in doubt of their first beginning, issue and denomination: so as they cannot decipher their true and continned Chronologie, but since <HI>Charlemaignes</HI> time. But the <HI>Frisons</HI> hauing to this day alwaies kept one name and one dwelling, may directly and by a plain computation of times, report their gestes from the beginning vnto the ending: so hauing taken begin∣ning 313. yeares before CHRIST, and since that time foure times made proofe of the change and Estate of their Common weale: they may by a cleer computation of yeares, shew how long they were vnder princes, then vnder dukes▪ after vnder Kings, vnto <HI>Charlemaigne,</HI> and since vnder <HI>Podestates,</HI> vntill their <HI>Anarchia;</HI> how long also vnder the <HI>Factions</HI> vnto the resignation which <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> made vnto the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and how long vnder the house of <HI>Austria</HI> vntil their Emance∣pation and liberty, which they inioy at this present, prouing from the beginning of their Princes the foundation and building of the towne of <HI>Staueren,</HI> which then was the cheefe of al the Realme of <HI>Fris∣land.</HI> By reason of which Antiquity this town hath had a prerogatiue from the Kinges of <HI>Denmarke,</HI>

<P>To describe the questions which are betwixt the ancient and moderne Authors, to find out the truth from what place <HI>Friso</HI> and his two bretheren <HI>Bruno</HI> and <HI>Saxo</HI> are first descended, were in my opinion a tedious and endlesse labour, seeing they can deter∣mine nothing that is certaine, no more then of the Ancestors of these three princes; which some main∣tained to be descended from <HI>Ragau,</HI> sonne to <HI>Sem,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Noe:</HI> But it appeares plainely that they were of the reliques of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Armie, ha∣uing serued <HI>Alexander</HI> the great in his conquest of <HI>Asia</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> who placed them in garrison in the <HI>Emodian</HI> Mountaines. But the <HI>Indiens</HI> after the death of <HI>Alexondar,</HI> beeing perswaded by <HI>Sandroco∣tus</HI> to rebell; <HI>Friso</HI> with his two bretheren and all their friendes imbarked in three hundred ships in the yeare of the creation, 3642. &amp; before the Nati∣uity of <HI>Christ,</HI> three hundred twenty one, &amp; so put to sea, sailing from one country to another, seeking some new dwelling, but they wandred vp and down eight yeares and could not bee receiued: In the end of so many ships (whether that the Seas had swal∣lowed them vp, or spoyled with age, or otherwise lost) there were but fifty foure which arriued at a safe Port, wherof eighteen landed in <HI>Prussia,</HI> twelue

<P>Hauing taken land they presently built a Temple to <HI>Iupiter,</HI> which in their language the called <HI>Stauo▪</HI> and there they built a towne, which of the name of their God they called <HI>Stauora,</HI> which is now the towne of <HI>Staueren</HI> standing vpon the <HI>Frisons</HI> sea, the which they fortified: wherby they defended them∣selues not only against the <HI>Suedens,</HI> but also against the <HI>Danes, Brittons</HI> and others, getting their liuing as well of pyracie at sea, as by tilling of the ground, vntill the people beeing multiplied, and questions growing daily among them by reason of the strait∣nes of their country, which was not sufficient to feed al their cattel: Prince <HI>Friso</HI> fearing that this cō∣tention of the Commons (he being the elder of his brethren) might breed some dislike betwixt them three, propounded a meanes to maintain loue &amp; a∣mity betwixt them; who hauing imparted it vnto the people; this was found the most expedient: That <HI>Bruno</HI> and <HI>Saxo</HI> with their families (leauing this part of <HI>Frisland)</HI> should seeke forth some new habitations neere vnto it, as well for themselues as for their successors: So as beeing neighbours one vnto an other, they might not onely enter∣tain themselues in the Discilpine and Institution of

their Ancestors, but also succor one another with their common forces, against all incursions of their enemies So three hundred years before CHRIST, <HI>Saxo</HI> and <HI>Bruno</HI> parted from <HI>Staueren,</HI> and passing by the <HI>Flye,</HI> they sayled towardes the East, vntill they came to <HI>Haldr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cht,</HI> or <HI>Saxony,</HI> neere vnto the <HI>Germa∣ine</HI> Sea, whereas entring into the gulph of <HI>Albis,</HI> they landed by little and litttle, and hauing chased away the Inhabitants by force, they wonne a great country. <HI>Bruno</HI> (for that hee would not discontent his brother) went towards the West, by the <HI>Visurge</HI> or <HI>Wezer,</HI> where hee founded a Cittie of his owne name called <HI>Brunswick.</HI> (VVhat this word of <HI>Wick</HI> signifies wee haue shewed before) the which al∣though it hath beene often destroyed, built againe and augmented, yet when as the posterity of <HI>Bruno</HI> came once to faile, it hath alwaies retained the ti∣tle of a free towne: So as in the time of <HI>Charlemaign</HI> it was wholy destroyed, but in the yeare eight hun∣dred sixtie one it was re-edified againe by <HI>Bruno</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> sonne to <HI>Ludoph;</HI> wherof I thought good to make mention, for that <HI>Albert Crantz</HI> doth maintaine, that the towne of <HI>Brunswick</HI> was first founded by this <HI>Bruno</HI> sonne to <HI>Ludolph.</HI> Touching the gests of <HI>Bruno</HI> and <HI>Saxo,</HI> and of their successors <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Brunswickains,</HI> wee will leaue them to such as haue written the histories of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Brunswick,</HI> and will onely speake of our <HI>Friso:</HI> who beeing the first Prince of the <HI>Frisons,</HI> after the de∣parture of his Bretheren, retained al <HI>Frisland</HI> for his

<P>These seuen parts of <HI>Frisland</HI> called <HI>Zeelādts,</HI> were diuided &amp; compast in by certaine riuers, wherof be∣twixt <HI>Eldere</HI> and <HI>Flye</HI> were fiue▪ that is, <HI>Lanwer, Eems, Wezer, Elbe,</HI> and <HI>Iadua.</HI> Betwixt the <HI>Flye</HI> and <HI>Eems</HI> there were three of these <HI>Zeelandts,</HI> very wel peop∣led vpō the South side, for that the North part was not habitable by reason of the lakes, moors, &amp; bogs, which were inaccessible, &amp; for want of banks to de∣fend them from the Inondation of the sea. wherfore the places most frequēted were that of <HI>Staueren,</HI> the seauen forests, <HI>Steenwick, Twent, Drent,</HI> a part of the Territory of <HI>Groning, Benthem</HI> and <HI>Oldenburch,</HI> all which lay togither vpon the maine land: All which vntil <HI>Charlemaignes</HI> time was called High <HI>Frisland,</HI> as it may appeare by the writing of some Saints which haue preacht the Word of God there.

her the best Marchandise hee should finde in the East Countries: For that hee brought nothing backe but Wheat, which hee held to bee best; This vaine woman commaunded the Maister, that if hee had laden it on the larboord side, hee should cast it into the Sea on the starboord side▪ which ha∣uing done, God sent a tempest which did so moue the sandes of the sea, as in the same place where the Wheat had beene cast forth, there did rise a barre or banke of sand, which hath euer since spoy∣led the Hauen of the said Towne, which hath de∣priued them quite both of their Nauigation and wealth, so as since the Inhabitants (hauing beene often spoyled) are now growne more modest.</P>

had by her one son, called <HI>Thierry,</HI> who in the 300. yeare of CHRISTS natiuity, which was the 2. of the raign of <HI>Haron</HI> the 5. duke of the old <HI>Frisons</HI> his cousin, led a Collony into that quarter of <HI>West-fris∣land,</HI> with the help of the said <HI>Haron,</HI> and other four of his cousins, the which at that time by reason of the multitude of Ilands, Moores, Lakes, and other stil waters, was not yet inhabited: yet with that aid and the interest he had by his wife, he made this se∣cond part (which at this present is <HI>Waterlandt)</HI> habi∣table and fertil, in the which are <HI>Edam, Monikendam, Purmerends, Woormer, Ryp, Graft</HI> and other good vil∣lages, so as of these two parts ioined togither, with that which he added afterwards on the west part, he made an Estate, and built a Pallace at <HI>Medenblike,</HI> which he made the cheefe town of the whole coun∣try.

two hundred thirty three yeares, fiue and twentie yeares after the death of <HI>Elim,</HI> in the yeare of <HI>Christ</HI> fiue hundred thirty three. <HI>Beroald</HI> after the death of <HI>Richold</HI> his father did inherit the Realme of East <HI>Frisland.</HI> Thus were the two <HI>Frislands</HI> vnited to∣gether; the which <HI>Beroald</HI> inioyed sixtie yeares: whereof he was afterwards depriued, and of his life also, by <HI>Clotaire</HI> the second of that name King of <HI>France,</HI> father to <HI>Dagobert:</HI> Notwithstanding <HI>Adgill</HI> the second succeeded him, and after him <HI>Gombauld,</HI> then <HI>Radbod</HI> the second, whome <HI>Charlemaigne</HI> van∣quished, and freed the <HI>Frisons</HI> from the yoake of Kinges: restoring them to their liberty, to whome hee gaue goodly priuiledges, the which they haue long maintained with the prise of their bloods.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Frisons</HI> were long vnder an Aristo∣craticall Gouernment, sometimes vnder Potes∣tates whom they did chose them-selues, and not able to agree vppon the election by reason of dan∣gerous factions, the Earles of <HI>Holland</HI> hauing in succession of time and long warres, seazed vpon that part which they now call <HI>West-Frisland</HI> and <HI>Waterlandt,</HI> the which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> will haue, (but the Inhabitants of the country cannot indure it) called <HI>Northolland.</HI> On the other side, the dukes of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> the Hans townes of <HI>Breme</HI> and <HI>Ham∣bourg,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Oldenbourg, Schowenbourg</HI> and <HI>Embden</HI> haue vsurped much of East <HI>Frislād,</HI> euen vn∣to the Territory of <HI>Groning:</HI> the which although it be an Estate &amp; territory apart, is cōprehended not∣withstanding
<PB N="233" REF="121"/>
vnder the territory of that which hereafter we will simply call <HI>Frisland,</HI> inclosed be∣twixt the <HI>Flye</HI> and <HI>Ems,</HI> to distinguish it from <HI>East-Frisland</HI> held by the Earles of <HI>Embden,</HI> and <HI>West-Frisland,</HI> anexed to the county of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>That then which we will simply call <HI>Frisland,</HI> and the Inhabitants <HI>Frisons,</HI> as <HI>Tolomcy</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> tearme them, saying that they are <HI>Germaines,</HI> and people from beyond the <HI>Rhine,</HI> whom <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Cauches,</HI> the great and the lesse, are <HI>Aborigines,</HI> or originally come from that place: who aboue all the people of <HI>Germanie</HI> retaine their ancient appellati∣on, keeping in their ancient and first seat, hauing the same language they haue alwaies had. True it is that in the chiefe townes they vse the Dutch∣tongue, but in the champian country they keepe their <HI>Frison</HI> language, which the gentlemen take pleasure to entertaine in regard of the antiquitie. Although I bee well acquainted with the high and low Dutch tongue, yet I must confesse that in this ancient <HI>Frison</HI> language I vnderstand nothing.</P>
<P>Wee haue sayd before that the <HI>Frisons</HI> did for a time entertaine themselues vnder factions, wee must therefore relate succinctly the beginning thereof: which was that in the yeare of our re∣demption. 1390. there did rise two factions in the country of <HI>Frisland,</HI> the one <HI>Vetcoopers,</HI> which sig∣nifies in their vulgar tongue, marchants of grease, that is to say, marchants of fat oxen, which they hold for an honest kinde of marchandise, and of
<PB N="234" REF="122"/>
<HI>Schyeringers,</HI> which are butchers and sellers of tripes, which is a base kinde of trade, which facti∣ons they say came from East and West <HI>Frisland.</HI> The first spring and beginning thereof was; that all these marchants of cattell and the butchers bee∣ing togither at a publick banket according to their custome, there was a guest to choose a Prouost, a Deane or a King amongst them, whose charge should bee to looke that no disorder should bee committed, which might trouble the companie. There was amongst them of either of these two companies, one that exceeded the rest, and both e∣quall in wealth, in respect and loue towards all the guests. Whom both the one and the other partie contended to chose, their Deane, Prouost or King: the one and the other maintayning that this digni∣ty &amp; authority at the table, was most befitting him that had the honestest trade. Wherevpon a questi∣on grew among them, which of those two marchan∣dise was the honestest: the one preferring the mar∣chants of cattell, the other the butchers. Vpon which dispute their braines being het with wine, in the end they fell from words to blowes one against an other, party against party, euery one with his Al∣lies and Kinsmen, meaning to maintaine the one quarrell or the other: so as in the end there was a great fight, in the which many were either hurt or slaine. In reuenge whereof, either party holding it selfe wronged, they began to make factions, and to bandie one against an other: so as this canker eat∣ing
<PB N="235" REF="122"/>
more and more; strangers (who had no interest, nor were any way wronged) ingaged themselues, vpon hope of bootie of the one or the other par∣tie: euerie one wresting what hee could from his Aduersarie, without either lawe or iustice (so confused were things then and full of disorder) but such as they made by the sworde, where as the strongest carried it. The fruits of these facti∣ons were such, as they not onely rained amongst priuate persons, but amongst whole fam lies, vil∣lages, bourrougs and townes, yea among whole Prouinces, so as the whole country was ful of thefts and murthers, and no man was free from their in∣solencies. In like maner about that time <HI>Hollād</HI> was afflicted with the factions of <HI>Hoecks</HI> and <HI>Cabillaux</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Hamesons</HI> and the <HI>Merlus,</HI> wherof we haue made mentiō heretofore: which was, that the one party (as the <HI>Merlus</HI> or <HI>Coddes</HI> bee fishes which prey) did threaten to deuower the other: and they of the <HI>Hamesons</HI> did threaten to take the others by the throat: which to speake truth were quarrels scarce fit for children. And at that time were the factions of <HI>Gelphes &amp; Gibelins</HI> in <HI>Italy:</HI> Of the diuer∣sity of colloured caps in <HI>Flanders,</HI> &amp; of those of the starre in <HI>France,</HI> al which were factions raised from the diuill. This mischiefe proceeded so farre in <HI>Frisland,</HI> as from the lesse it came to the greater, and from Marchants and Bourgers to the Nobility and Clergie: The gentlemen ruining the houses &amp; castles one of an other: and the Abbots and Monks doing al the mischief they could one vnto an other:
<PB N="236" REF="123"/>
So as to appease these factions, and to reconcile the Noblemen, the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the first, sent <HI>Otto van Langen</HI> to perswade them to choose a Po∣testat amongst them, which should gouerne the country according to their preuiledges, vnder the authority of the Empire. But their splene was so great, as euery one seeking to choose one of their faction, the sayd commissioner preuailed nothing, but returned as hee came. So as the Emperour to force them to an accord, tooke occasion to giue the gouernment hereditary of all <HI>Frisland</HI> and <HI>Gro∣ning</HI> to the house of <HI>Saxony,</HI> to hold it in fee of the Empire.</P>
<P>For the attayning whereof, the Dukes of <HI>Saxony</HI> hauing spent a great part of their means with small profit, finding this people so impatient of a strang∣ers yoake, in the end Duke <HI>George</HI> resigned all his interest vnto the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth who enioyed it quietly, as his sonne <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spaine</HI> also did, till within these thirty yeares that they freed themselues by their adiunction vnto the ge∣nerall vnion of the confederate Prouinces of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> Thus much we haue thought good to speake of the beginning and Estate of <HI>Frisland</HI> in generall; Now wee will describe the townes in particular.</P>

<HEAD>LEEWARDEN.</HEAD>
<P>IS at this day (as in old time <HI>Staueren</HI> was wont
<PB N="237" REF="123"/>
to bee) the chiefe towne of <HI>Frisland,</HI> situated al∣most in the center of the countrie, called in anci∣ent time during the Paganisine, <HI>Aula Dei,</HI> and in the vulgar tongue Godts▪hoff▪ that it to say the court of God, in the which was a colledge or schole for the <HI>Druides,</HI> Philosophers and wise men of that time, which were come out of <HI>France</HI> to plant their colleges there. In witnesse whereof, there are yet in this towne two Temples, the one named the ancient court, the other the new, whereof the gentlemen of the country were in former times called <HI>Hovelingen,</HI> that is to say courtiers, for that they were constituted publike defenders of this house of <HI>God</HI> taught by the <HI>Druides.</HI> And in truth this towne hath more gentlemen in it, then a∣ny other in <HI>Frisland.</HI> Of this schoole of the <HI>Druides, Synard</HI> the wise, a diuine and councellor to <HI>Radbod</HI> the last King of the <HI>Frisons</HI> was Rector, whom hee councelled to persecute the Christians; hee censu∣red and caused <HI>Tullies</HI> bookes of the nature of the Gods to bee burnt, condemning them as full of er∣rors and contrarie to the doctrine which they taught, of the false Gods of the gentills. This towne in processe of time hauing taken the name of <HI>Leewarden,</HI> and the country beeing conuerted to the christian Religion, this schoole of the <HI>Druides</HI> was changed into a cloister of Nunnes, by <HI>Vboalt</HI> in the yeare 1233. the which <HI>Dodo</HI> the fourth Ab∣bot of <HI>Fleurencamp,</HI> would haue also called, <HI>Aulam Dei,</HI> for that he would not haue the memory of that
<PB N="238" REF="124"/>
name lost. But in the vulgar tongue it hatth beene called <HI>Nyen-clooster,</HI> that is to say a New cloister. They of <HI>Leewarden</HI> haue alwaies continued (as it appeeres by all ancient and moderne writers) and entertained their schoole in good learning: which hath euer beene the chiefe of all <HI>Frisland.</HI> Vntil that within these 20. yeares, the Estates of the Prouince haue erected an vniuersity in the town of <HI>Franiker,</HI> two leagues from thence; for the entertainement of which schoole, as at this present of the vniuersitie, and of the learned professors which are there, in all faculties, the magistrates of <HI>Leuwarden</HI> haue neuer spared any charge.</P>
<P>In this towne is the court of Parliament for all <HI>Frisland,</HI> which doth determine of all causes both criminall and ciuill: whether all causes come and are to bee decided according to the sincerity of the <HI>Romaine</HI> lawes, the which are obserued there with the like purity as they were made by the Emperor <HI>Iustinian,</HI> and as they are taught in vniuersities, ha∣uing not aboue twenty municipall lawes or cus∣tomes, derogating from the written law. All pro∣ceedings and other publike acts are made in the Dutch tongue, their stile of writing, and the forme of their letters and caracters, as wel printed as writ∣ten, are as pure and neate as in any other courts of <HI>Brabant, Flanders, Holland, Vtrecht,</HI> and other places of the <HI>Netherlands:</HI> So as the naturall <HI>Frisons</HI> as also the <HI>Brabansons, Hollanders, Flemings</HI> and other Dutche, may easilie execute all Offices of Magi∣strates,
<PB N="239" REF="124"/>
Secretaries and Notaries, as well in one countrie as in an other, depending vpon writing, bee it of Iustice, Pollicy, Account, Treasure or o∣therwise.</P>
<P>This town of <HI>Leuwarden</HI> is seated in the quarter of <HI>Ostergoe,</HI> being great and spacious, and contey∣ning in circuit neere halfe a French league; the streetes are faire, large and straight, in the which it is not lawfull to leaue any filthinesse, euery house hauing a boate, into the which they cast it; the which beeing full, they transport it by barkes into the fieldes: the towne beeing so diuided by nauigable chanells (whereon there are manie bridges) to serue as well for the trafficke of mar∣chandise, as for other commodities, so as most houses maie bring their prouisions vppe to their doores, or not farre from them: The which doe also serue greatly for the clensing of the streetes, the raine washing awaie all the filth (if any re∣maines in the streetes) into the chanelles. The ayre is cleere, but some-what brackish by reason of the exhalations of the sea which is nere: which is the cause that it doth not lightly ingender any putrifaction, neither is it often infected, with any contagious disease.</P>
<P>It standes in a verie pleasant countrie, full of goodlie Medowes, euen vnto the towne∣ditches, beeing a pleasant sight on Sundaies and Festiuall dayes, to beholde the Bourgers walking and supping vppon the greene grasse
<PB N="240" REF="125"/>
by troupes. It hath also many pleasant villages round about the towne, which seeme as walkes for the Inhabitants. The situation is (as we haue said) in the midest of <HI>Frisland,</HI> so as on a sommers day they may goe either in wagon, or horse-backe or on foote on which side they please, either to <HI>Ostergoe Westergoe,</HI> or the <HI>Seauen Forests,</HI> out of the country, where they haue good meanes to goe and trans∣port their marchandise by shipping either great or small.</P>
<P>In regard of which commodities and the good∣nesse of the seat, <HI>Albertus</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>George</HI> his son, hauing obtained the hereditary go∣uernment of <HI>Frisland</HI> from <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Empe∣ror, did there settle the Parliament for the whole Prouince, which the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth and his sonne King <HI>Philippe,</HI> haue since allowed and confirmed; moreouer <HI>Friseland</HI> hath good ha∣uens on euery side, by the which they may com∣modiously and speedely bring all sorts of marchan∣dise and commodities vnto the town, which makes it cheape lyuing there.</P>
<P>This towne hath vnder his Griteny, that is to say, Baylewicke or Iurisdiction, which they call <HI>Leewarderadeel</HI> seauenteene good villages depend∣ing thereon: for in all the quarter of <HI>Ostergoe,</HI> whereof this towne is the chiefe, there are ten Gri∣tenies, euery one of which hath his villages de∣pending thereon, some more, some lesse, contey∣ning alltogither one hundred thirty and two vil∣lages
<PB N="241" REF="125"/>
in the sayd ten Gritenies▪ besides the towne of <HI>Dockum</HI> which is the second towne of that quarter of <HI>Ostergoe,</HI> wherof we will presently speak.</P>
<P>In this towne doth commonly reside the col∣ledge of deputies for the Estates of the whole Pro∣uince, consisting of the nobility and townes, which gouerne the whole Estate, as well for matters of policy and warre, as for religion, who with the voi∣ces of the Gritenies, dispose of all Estates and Of∣fices, both of Iustice, treasure and demains, as also of captaines places, and others concerning the war and the Ecclesiasticall Estate.</P>
<P>There is also the minte for money for the whole country, both for gold and siluer according to the order which the deputies for the Estates shall fet downe: the which notwithstanding is subiect to the generalls of the mints of all the vnited Prouinces, when need requires.</P>
<P>The people there are as courteous, humble and affable, yea more then in any other towne of the whole Prouince, or in <HI>Holland &amp; Zeeland,</HI> although the <HI>Frisons</HI> haue beene held to bee some-what rude and inciuill; the which appeeres contrary by the frequentation of learned men of the court of Parli∣ament, &amp; by the exercise of learning: for that there is not a Bourger, if he haue any means, but he sends his children to schoole: The which is seene at this day by many learned men, whom I wil not now flat∣ter, for that they are yet lyuing, as also by those which for their knowledge haue beene of great

authority: Amongst which was <HI>George Ratalder,</HI> councellor to the King in the great councell at <HI>Macklin,</HI> doctor in the lawes, and a good Poet, who in the yeare 1566. was sent by the Dutchesse of <HI>Parma,</HI> Gouernesse of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> in Ambas∣sage to the King of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> for the affaires of the said countries.

<P>A league from this towne is the village of <HI>Zuy∣chem,</HI> famous at this day by the memory of <HI>Viglus Aita Zuychemus,</HI> in his life time President of the councell of Estate for the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> at <HI>Brussels,</HI> whose wife being de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, he was made a Bishop and Prouost of Saint <HI>Bauon</HI> at <HI>Gant:</HI> where hee built a goodly house, where one of his heires liues whom I haue visited within these ten yeares: Hee also erected a free schoole for a certaine number of poore children and a schoolemaster, and beside s it an Hospitall for old men and women of that village, the which are well lodged and entertained accor∣ding to the capacity of the foundation.</P>

I haue not beene in any towne in <HI>Holland,</HI> whereas they liue better cheape in their Innes then here, wherby we may Iudge how the Burgers do, which make their prouisions at the best hand. I haue found there learned men and very courte∣ous, and it is famous for that it is the place where-<HI>Gemma Frisius</HI> was borne, whom in my youth I knew at <HI>Louuain</HI> a great Phisition and Mathemati∣cien, whereof his workes giue sufficient testymony. He died at <HI>Louuain</HI> in the yeare 1555. leauing one son called <HI>Cornelius Gemma Frisius,</HI> of the same pro∣fession that his father was. In this town is carefully kept and with great reuerence, the booke of the ho∣lie <HI>Euangelists,</HI> written by Saint <HI>Boniface</HI> himselfe, who was before called <HI>Winfrid,</HI> hee who after Saint <HI>Willebroard</HI> (otherwise called <HI>Clement)</HI> did greatly augment the faith of IESVS CHRIST in <HI>Frisland,</HI> where afterwards he was made a martir, with 52. of his companiōs, in <HI>Westfrisland:</HI> where they say there are yet some of that race which massacred thē, who from their birth carry a white marke, or rather a tuft of white haire on their heads.

<P>THis is one of the most ancient and renownedst townes in <HI>Frisland,</HI> in the which not farre from the port of <HI>Harlingen,</HI> there is a little castle, in the which <HI>Henry</HI> sonne to Duke <HI>Albert</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> was for a time as it were besieged by the other townes of <HI>Frisland,</HI> which hee tooke so disdainefully., as hee resigned all his interest in the sayd countrie to his Brother <HI>George,</HI> who since sold it to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth. Although that the castles of <HI>Leuwarden</HI> and <HI>Harlingen,</HI> were during the warres ruined, yet this beeing of small impor∣tance stands still; for that it hath no meanes to a∣noy the towne, hauing no passage without it wher∣by they might giue entry vnto the enemy, but doth onely serue for a gentlemans lodging. The towne is seated in the quarter of <HI>Westergoe,</HI> which is the se∣cond part of <HI>Frisland,</HI> in the which besides <HI>Franiker</HI> there are eight townes more, which are, <HI>Harlin∣gen, Bolswaert, Sneck, Ylstt, Worcum, Hindelopen, Sta∣ueren</HI> and <HI>Sloten,</HI> vnder which quarter there are eight <HI>Gritenies</HI> or <HI>Baylewycks,</HI> the which one with an other haue 125. villages depending on them.

<P><PB N="245" REF="127"/>
The Estates of <HI>Frisland</HI> desiring to prouide for the instruction of their youth, haue within these twenty yeares erected an vniuersity in the sayd towne, with great priuileges, the which maks it the more famous, in the which they entertaine many professors in al faculties, with good pensions, which drawes many schollers thether from all parts, euen out of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> whereas the Estates of the country haue a sworne printer.

Two which are of the councell haue care of the works, reparations and entertainement of the fortifica∣tions and gates of the towne, and meddle not with the Iustice, but their charge is also to looke vnto all crimes that are commited, and to deliuer the offenders to the Officer, to bee punished according to the exigence of the fact: which Regents and Administrators receiue their authorite and com∣mission yearely from the Gouernor and councel of the Prouince.

The towne is long and narrow, inlarged and fortified with rampars and bulwarks, but of small importance and ill intertained, as beeing held at this present time not greatly necessarie: The houses in the great streete are resonable faire and well built, the Inhabitants liue by their handy-workes and by the Sea, but not of such nauigation and trafficke as they were wont to haue.</P>

of the country, with turfes and al sorts of prouision, necessary for the towne which suburbes are so for∣tefied as the Inhabitants thinke themselues as safe there as within the towne: it is called <HI>Schuytendiep.</HI> Within these ten yeares the generall Estates (for some ielousie which they had of the sayd towne) as well for feare of intelligences of some Burgers with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as also to take away all occasion for <HI>Enno</HI> Earle of East-<HI>frisland</HI> to attempt against the sayd towne, caused a cittadell to bee built, in the which they entertained an ordinary garrison the which kept the mutins in awe.</P>

Finally the situation of this towne is such, that as they may carrie and transport whatsoeuer they please by water: so may they also doe by land at all seasons of the yeare, by the <HI>Drenth</HI> and other neigh∣bour places to the fronters of <HI>Germany,</HI> which brings great proffit to the towne.</P>

And the chiefe point wherein the <HI>Omme∣lands</HI> haue yeelded vnto the towne, the which they haue enioyed for these many yeares, is touching matters of Iustice, by the which the wise men of the country are gouerned, Inferior Iudges kept in awe, the iurisdiction maintained, the pride of the ritch and mighty restrained, and the Edicts belong∣ing to the common-weale, concerning their autho∣ritie published.

which he had built should be razed, the which the <HI>Geldrois</HI> (to augment his <HI>Signeuries)</HI> would not neg∣lect, sending the Seignior of <HI>Oyen</HI> to take posses∣sion: and thus the towne and state of <HI>Groning</HI> fell into the hands of the <HI>Geldrois</HI> which was the cause of great warres betwixt the two Dukes of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Geldres.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Geldrois</HI> being put in possession of the towne in the yeare, 1518. and of the <HI>Ommelandes,</HI> 1521.

They seeing them-selues thus circumuented, and knowing the dukes intention, grew cold in their affection which they did first beare him, turning it to the house of <HI>Bourgongne,</HI> where-vpon hauing re∣solued with the consent of the <HI>Ommelands</HI> they did write vnto <HI>George Schencke,</HI> Baron of <HI>Tautenburg,</HI> knight of the order of the Golden-fleece, gouernor of <HI>Friseland</HI> for the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the fift accor∣ding to the resignation which the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> had made vnto him, to which effect the sayd Seig∣nor <HI>Schencke</HI> (hauing receiued commission from

the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> Queene of <HI>Hungary,</HI> sister to the Emperor) marched with all the forces hee could thether, where he entred in Iune in the yeare. 1536. and there receiued their oth of fidelity, in the Em∣perors name, as Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> Earle of <HI>Flanders, Holland, Zeeland,</HI> &amp;c. Lord of <HI>Friseland</HI> and <HI>Ouerissel,</HI> but vpon certaine conditions, that the members and state of the Seigneury of <HI>Groning</HI> should hold their priuiledges, right and statutes, as they had receaued them from their ancestors: that the towne should hold their ancient Preture and the foraine: that they should build a pallace in the towne for the Empe∣ror fit for a Prince, but without any fortification: the forts in the country should be razed, &amp; noe new built, if necessity did not require it for the defence of the country and of the towne, out of whose reue∣nues there should be yearely payed vnto the Empe∣ror &amp; to his successors 12000. crownes, vpō which conditiō <HI>Phillip</HI> K▪ of <HI>Spaine</HI> was receiuedin Ianuary. 1550. Among all the priuiledges of the said towne, they haue one very notable, which came from their ancestors, with an inviolable contynuation, which is; That noe King▪ Prince, Estate nor common∣weale, can call any <HI>Bourger</HI> or Cittizen of that towne into iustice, nor cause him to bee cited or adiorned before any court, but onely before the Senat or his ordinary iudge: more-ouer that noe man might appeale from any sentence that were giuen, either in ciuill or cryminall causes, neither from the court of <HI>Hoffmans</HI> or iudiciall chamber,
<PB N="283" REF="146"/>
in that which concernes their iurisdiction, from the which no man of what quality so euer may decline▪ moreouer the towne is Lady and mistrisse of her owne lawes and statutes, the which by a so∣ueraigne power they may make and vndoe, create and abrogate without the authority of any per∣son. The Estates of the <HI>Ommelands</HI> haue also the like authority in their regard. The towne hath had a priuiledge to coyne siluer and copper for these foure hundred years, and gold since the yeare. 1474.</P>
<P>The Magistracy of the towne consists as it hath done time out of mind, of foure Bourgue-maisters and twelue Senators (but of late daies, for before they were wont to haue 16.) which are the head of the common-weale, all hauing equal voices, but not equall in dignity and authority. This Senat takes knowledge of all that concernes the towne: they haue power to choose the <HI>Hoftmans</HI> or Pretors of the country &amp; to send ambassages wher need should require: to conclude, their duty is to prouide both in general &amp; particular for the good of the common weale. Their charge is for two yeares and they are created with such order as euery yeare eight are de∣posed, and other eight subrogated in their places, a∣mong the which I comprehend the Bourguemaister.</P>
<P>After the Senat and <HI>Hoftmans,</HI> there is within the towne a colledge of 24. men, chosen out of the best families, which they cal the sworne councellors for that from yeare to yeare they binde them-selues by oth to the Common-weale of <HI>Groning,</HI> without
<PB N="280" REF="147"/>
whome the Senat cannot resolue of any matters of importance, concerning the whole common-weale as to vndertake a warre, or to giue it ouer; to con∣tract alliances, make lawes or to breake them, build new forts or other publike workes: change their mony; bring the towne in debt or chtage it with rents otherwise: To treat of which things, the senat causeth them to be called, which haue beene depo∣sed, whom they call the old senat: and some-times they call some of the best cittizens of the towne, as the Deans or maister of the cheefe trades, men of great credit among the people. This colledg of foure and twenty sworne men, hath as it were a tri∣umuirat, which speakes for them all, and bind them∣selues by oth vnto the Senat, to procure the townes good, and to make a faithful report of all, the which may properly bee called <HI>Tribunes</HI> of the people.</P>
<P>There are many other offices in the towne, ser∣uing for the entertainment and preseruation there∣of: as Prouosts of the wacth, Maisters of quarters: Heads, Captaine or <HI>Deans</HI> of the sworne compa∣nies, whom the Senat doth choose for life: Maisters of workes, ouerseers of the waights and mesures for bread and beere. To conclude, it seemes there wants nothing for a well gouerned common-weale.</P>
<P>The manner of chosing the Magistrat in that towne is as followeth. One halfe of the councell which are sixeteene and of the twenty foure sworne men are yeerely deposed, whose places are filled by fiue personages well qualified among the twenty
<PB N="285" REF="147"/>
foure Iurats whome the Gouernor of the Prouince doth name, which fiue do choose out of all the towne eight new councellors, to fill vp the places of them that are deposed, which eight newly cho∣sen, with eight old remaining, chose foure Bourgue∣maisters, more-ouer the Gouernor names (besides the twenty foure sworne men) fiue other men who choose twelue among the commons of the towne, to fill vp the place of twelue that were deposed, so the twelue new Iurats with the tw elue of the old remayning, make vp the number of tw enty foure, all which together choose the three Tribunes.</P>
<P>There is also in that towne an ordinarie free schole or rather a colledge, which is very famous by reason of Doctor <HI>Vbbo Emmius,</HI> an excellent Histo∣riographer, who was Rector and go uerned it: of whose writing we haue for the most part made vse, in the description of <HI>Freeseland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ommelands</HI> are diuided into three quarters; the <HI>Feuelingo, Himsing,</HI> and the west quarter, euery one hauing their preuiledges written in diuers Seigneuries, as places of iudgement, which they call <HI>Redgerrechten, Gretenies</HI> or <HI>Baylewiks,</HI> whereof the bourguemasters, and councel of the towne haue some, and the Nobles or proprietaries of the said towne and <HI>Ommelands</HI> haue the rest: in the which the <HI>Redgers, Gryetmans</HI> or Bayliffes take knowledge both of ciuill and criminall causes, and determine of them according vnto equity and iustice, from which sentences in euery iurisdiction &amp; Seigneury,

In other causes not concer∣ning the matters aboue specified, in case of appeale, they go vnto the Lieutenants and Captaines of the towne of <HI>Groning,</HI> as the chiefe, and of the <HI>Omme∣lands,</HI> who in such cases iudge also by decree, (as we haue said) without any appeale, euocation or re∣mission: Being alwaies to bee vnderstood, that the said lieutenant: who is chosen by the Estates of the towne &amp; country, and the 4. Capitoux by the Bur∣guemasters and councell, may not meddle with the superintendency, nor the politik gouernment of the <HI>Ommelands,</HI> but according to the commission, oth and instructions which they haue from the Estates chosen by the towne and county: In the name and behalf of the soueraignty of the whole Estate, and Siegneury, they may administer Iustice, according to the right &amp; ancient customes of the Prouince.

Thus was <HI>Sluse</HI> reduced vnder the Estates com∣mand, much against <HI>Spinolas</HI> minde, who attemp∣ted twise to releeue it, but in vaine. It was yeelded vnto them a month before <HI>Ostend,</HI> which from that time was vnprofitable vnto them and of great charge, seeing they had <HI>Sluse,</HI> so as their gaine was much greater then their losse.

<P>IS a mighty fort on <HI>Flanders</HI> side, right against <HI>Flis∣ingue,</HI> standing toward the <HI>Sas</HI> of <HI>Gant &amp; Bocholdt,</HI> whereas the Archduke, for the importance of the place, did continually entertaine a great garrison both of foote and horse, to stop the incursions of them of <HI>Flissingue &amp; Berghen vp Zoom</HI> in that quar∣ter of the Wast of <HI>Flanders.</HI> And although hee did much rely in his fort, imagining it could not be easi∣ly taken: yet notwithstanding that there were 800. men in the fort, Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> besieged it, battred it, and forced it to come to composition in lesse then eight daies, before he gaue any assault. Since the E∣states haue inlarged it, &amp; it is now like vnto a town; likely in time to be of good trafficke, for that the ha∣uen is able to containe many shippes of 4. or 500. tuns a peece, being well situated vpon the sea, wher∣fore in my opinion the Estates will not suffer it to

<P>THis fort was built at one instant with that of <HI>Lilloo,</HI> beeing opposite vnto it vpon the riuer of <HI>Escault,</HI> so as all ship s that come from the sea to goe to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> must passe betwixt these two forts: But it could not resist the enemies attempts like vnto <HI>Lilloo:</HI> for in the yeare 1584. the Vicont of <HI>Gant</HI> Marquis of <HI>Roubay</HI> besieged it, and tooke it by as∣sault, by a stratageme which he made with a heape of strawe and haie, which he caused to bee burnt on the dicke-side where hee gaue the assault, so as the smoake being driuen with the winde, did so trouble their sights that defended the breach, as they were forced with great furie, the Vicont killing Collonel <HI>Petain,</HI> (who commanded there) with his owne hand, in cold bloud, and causing many Burgers of <HI>Antwerp</HI> to bee hanged: the which was afterwards reuenged vpon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other prisoners which they held in the vnited Prouinces.

<P>IT is a goodly fort, none of the greatest, but at this present like a little towne vpon the fronters of the countie of <HI>Lingen,</HI> which is the high-way to goe out of <HI>Friseland</HI> and <HI>Groning</HI> into the country of <HI>Westphalia,</HI> and by <HI>Cloppenbourg</HI> to <HI>Delmenhorst</HI> and <HI>Breme,</HI> and so to <HI>Hamburg, Lubecke</HI> and other towns of the East country, along the Baltique sea. Is is en∣tertained with a good ordinary garrison, consisting of many halfe companies (at the least when I was there) wherby (in my opinion) the Estates did wisely cutting off many Monopolies and occasions of mu∣tynies, for that there is seldome any accord where there is diuersitie. The countrie about is all moor∣ish or full of turfes, wherewith they doe both fur∣nish the place and the countrie about it.</P>

<P>IS a good village or rather a Borrough, at the end of the <HI>Dullard▪</HI> where as the riuer of <HI>Ems</HI> growes narrowest, by the which they must passe comming from <HI>Embden</HI> by water to goe to <HI>Boerentanghe,</HI> lea∣uing the castle of <HI>Wedde</HI> vpon the right hand: where the Estates haue made a fort to defend the county
<PB N="302" REF="156"/>
of <HI>Lingen:</HI> yet is it not so well fortefied, but it must yeeld to the first enemy if he be Maister of the field.</P>
<P>As for the other forts dispersed here and there∣vpon riuers, fronters and passages, beeing many in number, throughout all the vnited Prouinces, I haue thought it superfluous to describe them here particularly, hauing onely vndertaken the chiefe.</P>
<P>By this description may be seene, that in the said eight vnited Prouinces, which make the Estates of the <HI>Belgike</HI> Common-weale, there are aboue sixe∣score townes▪ great and small, and aboue a hundred castles and forts of all sorts, entertained with ordi∣narie garrisons, besides their troupes of reserue which they put into townes, especiallie in winter, or when they haue neede to refresh their compa∣nies either of foote or horse, where they are well lodged and accommodated.</P>
<P>Touching the shippes of warre which the vnited Estates doe vsually entertaine, as well at sea, as vp∣on the riuers of <HI>Rhine, Meuse, Wahal, Ems</HI> and o∣thers, I cannot set downe the number, the which is great, some-times more, some-times lesse, accord∣ing to the necessitie of their affaires: they haue some-times a hundred and twenty shippes of warre in paie, well armed and appointed with men and munition. Their nauigation and trafficke of mar∣chandise extends to the East, West, North and South. I dare boldly saie, that the Common-weale of <HI>Venice,</HI> which is held so ritch and mighty an E∣state, could not haue continued such intestine wars
<PB REF="156"/>
three years, as they haue done many, and doyet like the ebbing and flowing of the sea, whom all the forces of <HI>Spaine</HI> could neuer vanquish.</P>
<P>Wherefore wee must conclude that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> was ill aduised to intreate them with such rigor, as they haue beene forced to oppose them∣selues and to shake off his yoake. Whereas contra∣ry-wise, the King his sonne now raigning, (for feare of some greater inconuenience) hath with good ad∣uice, declared them free Estates, seeing that his fa∣ther could not with all his forces and treasure, de∣priue them of their liberties and freedomes: of∣fring then peace, without attending the preiudici∣all euent of a warre of a hundred yeares: as the Princes of <HI>Austria</HI> his Predecessors had against the Cantons of <HI>Suisses,</HI> who almost for the like occasi∣ons, did shake off their yoake, neere three hundred yeares since. Let vs praie vnto God, that their vni∣on may continue: the which may restraine the insolency of some of their Neighbours and norrish peace among them. Which God grant.</P>
