<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of
<HI>Dover,</HI> Viscount <HI>Rochford,</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Approach your Lordship with
the same hardiness as they who
satisfie themselves, that the
sincerity of the Giver may attone for
the little value of the gift; having
learnt this presumption from Histo∣ry,
where I find that great Princes
have look'd kindly upon mean obla∣tions,
and thereby rendred the ge∣nerosity
of their acceptance more il∣lustrious,
by the duty and obedience
of the Presenters.</P>
<P>Nor with this trick of moral sto∣ry
would I be thought to wind your
Lordship into the reception of a
trifle, but that I carry a braver de∣sign
in it; that is, on this occasion
<PB REF="3"/>
to make a publick acknowledgment
of the many and great favours (and
of one especially above the rest, the o∣verflow
of your nobleness) which you
have been pleas'd to confer upon your
unworthy servant. For (my Lord)
the sense of them hitherto, bounded
within the narrow knowledge of my
meanness, hath seem'd to me a kind
of guilty concealment, and almost
tantamount to a denyal of them, till
I was able to render this happy and
open declaration to the world, of an
humble and obsequious gratitude for
those favours done me; and so done,
that your generous affability in dis∣spensing
them may for ever condemn
the rough custom of the age, whose
haughty state in doing kindnesses,
does most commonly turn their
bread into stone.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
And though I know, that thanks
alone is no payment sterling; yet
since to the greatest Beings for the
greatest and most lasting benefits we
can scarce make any better return.
I hope it will not seem strange, if I
present your Lordship the memory of
your own goodness to pay your self.
For where the obligation exceeds
possibility of requital, the sawsiness
of attempting to satisfie, is infinitely
worse than the humble acknowledg∣ment
of still owing.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I offer to your view a
piece, that dare not stand the test of
your Judgment, but would humbly
shelter near your goodness, &amp; which
(when your Lordship takes breath
from your other more weighty both
publick and private affairs) may
<PB REF="4"/>
serve to entertain you in the less
serious part of the day; The matter
is least mine, the form &amp; composure
I may own a whole share in; so the
<HI>Bulloin</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> (if the allusion
be not presumptuous) becomes the
Kings coin, after it has receiv'd his
stamp &amp; image. And as after view∣ing
the scatter'd pleasures of a large
and fair Garden, some satisfaction
is receiv'd from the contracted scent
and beauty of a posie; so if I have
here at all justified the compa∣rison,
whatever error may have past
in the choice or ordering of the flow∣ers,
I hope your Lordship will pardon
to</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your Lordships most
humble and most grate∣ful
Servant,
G. H.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>TO THE
Most Accomplish'd
LADY,
Mrs. DOROTHY RIVERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce for Persons of Your Quality
and Merit, it is usual to suffer
Afflictions of this Nature; there
is now a necessity that you un∣dergo
Your Fate, which is so much the
sadder, in that all those Excellencies
which in you shine in their Meridian,
and might command Reverence from
the most Savage World, serve only to
incourage my Rudeness, and with me
to become accessory to your own Per∣secution.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
But it may be (<HI>Madam</HI>) after an
humble Acknowledgment of the guilt,
that Goodness of Yours (which ex∣cepts
no Sinners) may be gain'd to
think the Crime Venial, and that par∣ticular
Condescension which hath here∣tofore
showr'd Obligations upon Your
most humble Servant, may stretch out
Your saving Hand to receive a Present,
that would live onely in and by Your
favour.</P>
<P>'Tis true (<HI>Madam</HI>) that the Worth∣lesseness
of the Present might very
well have dispirited the boldest attempt
in this kind▪ had I not considered that
I should thereby better Consult for
Your Glory, when the World shall
take notice that my greatest Ambition
hath been not to raise Trophies to my
self by Writing well, but only to pay
my just and respectful Devoirs, and
that by publishing Your Names and
Vertues, I might shew a Pattern of all
that is Excellent and Good; which
(<HI>Madam</HI>) if I should strive to embellish
<PB REF="5"/>
with what Art of Words can add to
render any thing Illustrious, yet would
all fall far below the Dignity of the
Subject, and I should be constrain'd at
length to leave it as altogether unaffa∣ble.</P>
<P>If then (<HI>Madam</HI>) what is wanting to
the true payment of Justice and Obliga∣tion
to Your Vertues, Your Goodness
will allow my Zeal of owning to supply,
please to accept this trifle as the best
Testimony I can at present make of it,
which when receiv'd into Your choice
Closet, and sometime turn'd over by
Your fair Hands (when you please to
give Your own quainter thoughts leave
to rest) will give me just cause to call
my self the happyest man living, and for
ever fix me</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Madam</SALUTE>
Your most humble and most
obedient Servant.

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Present you (Reader) with a novelty,
which if your pallate be not wholly vi∣tiated,
may generally relish well with you.
For the variety of the matter you may call it
a kind of <HI>Olio,</HI> the seasoning of which hath
cost me both time and expence; and
though it be not of the choicest rarities, it is
done at least according to the best of my
skill. If by this slender attempt I may pro∣voke
any better able more handsomely and
regularly to couch a subject attended with
so much both profit and pleasure, I think I
have done the kind and industrious part of
<PB REF="7"/>
the world no ill office, who will (though
but for this reason) let pass without rigid
and supercilious Censure the mean Essay of
him, whose ardor to serve them, hath ren∣dred
him less seeing in the examination of
his own ability. Yet would I not be con∣ceiv'd
to know my self and value my pains
so little, but that I may merit some thanks,
at least from the well tempered measurers
of mens intentions: however some there
will be (and those not a few) whom I could
wish (because I love my self well) might
be won to my side) but I fear my single ta∣lent
of perswasion will never be able to gain
them; for being ill-natured, and therefore
doing nothing themselves but mischief,
they carry an intense hatred to those that
would humbly do good, nay though it be
done never so perfectly. What quarter
then my poor offering (being sensible to
how many exceptions it may be lyable) is
like to find among them I well know, but
have heart enough not much to fear; e∣specially
hoping among the Candid Ingeni∣ous
such reception as will amply remunerate
<PB REF="7"/>
me for all the ill usage I may meet with
elsewhere.</P>
<P>Here is a tast then (to you kind Reader
I speak it) of what in so useful a Subject
might be performed by a more judicious
pen, Analects of the History and Descripti∣on
of the World, not so choicely nor methodi∣cally
handled as might be expected, but yet
may serve to refresh your memory after the
tedious and ill way of other mighty Vo∣lumes.
It were a worthy employ for any
that hath parts and leisure to go through
with it (in a more acute and accurate man∣ner,
not emitting ought memorable) to ex∣tract
from those numerous Records of Hi∣story
all such short Memoirs as may tend
either to instruction or delight. And as he
will thereby infinitely oblige both these,
whose way of Education may have less qua∣lified
them to distinguish the Stars in sail∣ing
on the vast Ocean of Story; and those
also, whose confinement in time or coin
may disenable them for such expensive
ways of knowledge: So shall he in particu∣lar
find me the most acknowledging of all
<PB REF="8"/>
his Servants, must esteem mine most happy
faults, that have been to him incentives of
aspiring to the true glory of Writing better.</P>

<HEAD>Memorable things
Noted in the
DESCRIPTION
OF THE
WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>IN our Description of the World
there are four parts, into which the
World is divided; <HI>Europe, Asia,
Africa, America utraque.</HI></P>
<P>We will begin first with <HI>Asia,</HI> for in
<HI>Asia</HI> did God himself speak his miracu∣lous
work of the Creation: There was
the Church first collected, there was
the Saviour of the world born, Cruci∣fied
and Raised again: Indeed the great∣est
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
part of Divine History was there
written and Acted; There was the first
Monarch, and Monarchies of the World
in <HI>Assyria, Persia, Babylonia, Media.</HI> The
first people of the world received their
being in <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> and the several
tongues of the World their Original in
<HI>Babylonia:</HI> These are parts of <HI>Asia,</HI>
and were in the first ages blest with
God's own holy Presence, <HI>Exodus</HI> the
third; and the footing of <HI>Angels, Exod.</HI>
14. However, now it is left (for her In∣fidelity)
to the punishment of a Prophe∣tical
Curse that long before passed up∣on
her, and is delivered up into the
hands of Turks, and Nations that
Blaspheme the Creatour, and there∣fore
doth not flourish in that height
as heretofore.</P>
<P>Now add together, that this Re∣gion
was at first the Paradise of the
World, and indeed still enjoyeth a fer∣tile
Soyl and temperate Air, and that
it exceeds in compass the two other
parts of the old World, to which she was
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
the Mistress for Arts and Sciences; Yet is
it not at this day so well peopled in
proportion, as this little <HI>Europe,</HI> which
came many hundred years after; for
this we need search no further cause than
God's just Anger: Yet hath he not ex∣ercised
upon her, only by Miraculous
and Immediate Punishment from Hea∣ven,
but hath suffered (as it were) her
own Creatures, over which Man at
the first had the Rule) to turn head
upon their Lords, and possesse their
Habitation, for it is so over-run with
wild-Beasts, and cruel Serpents, that
in many places they live not without
much danger.</P>
<P>In this; though the Nation suffer for
their Monstrous Irreligion; Yet the
Earth which did not offend, reserves her
place, and abounds with many excellent
commodities, not else-where to be
had; Myrrhe, Frankincense, Cinamon,
Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Pepper, Musk,
Jewels of great esteem, and Minerals of
all sorts; It breeds Elephants, Camels,
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
and many other Beasts; Serpents, Fowl
wild and tame, and some have added
such Monstrous shapes of men, as passe
all belief.</P>
<P>In <HI>Asia</HI> were the seven Churches
which St. <HI>John</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Apo∣calips;</HI>
now scarce is it inhabited but to∣ward
the Sea-side, and that by a base
and abject people, such as are both lazy
in their life, and odious Idolaters in their
Religions, for the most part Mahu∣metans.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ephesus</HI> it self the Star of <HI>Asia,</HI>
that as well for her Reli∣gion
as her miraculous
Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is within the compass of that one part which bears the name of <HI>Asia pro∣pria.</HI></NOTE> set the world at
gaze upon her: It was
raised in the middle of the
City, Modelled out by
<HI>Ctesifon,</HI> but was 220. years in build∣ing,
and was ordered in such a ground,
that no Earth-quake should move it; It
was 425. foot long, and 220. broad,
and 127. Pillars, given by so many se∣veral
Kings, whereof twenty seven
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
were most curiously graven, all the rest
of Marble polished. In this City St.
<HI>John</HI> the Evangelist is said to have gone
down into his Grave alive, there be
who yet question his death.</P>
<P><HI>Armenia minor,</HI> which is one of the
Provinces of <HI>Asia minor,</HI> is by most
thought to be the Land of <HI>Ararat</HI> where
the Ark rested, And there is great store
of Oyl, and excellent Wine.</P>
<P><HI>Arabia Foelix</HI> in <HI>Asia major</HI> is account∣ed
the fruitfullest Country in the World.
In this <HI>Arabia</HI> is the City <HI>Medina,</HI> where
<HI>Mahomet</HI> is Intombed in an Iron Chest,
supported only by a Roof of Adamant,
without other Art to keep it from
falling to the ground.</P>
<P><HI>Cyprus</HI> a place heretofore Consecrated
to <HI>Venus,</HI> to whom both Men and Wo∣men
performed their Sacrifice naked, till
by the prayer of <HI>Barnabas</HI> the Apostle,
the Temple was ruined.</P>
<P><HI>Trojus</HI> Reports, that the Fathers of
this Isle had wont to prostitute their
Daughters to Mariners for money,
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
whereby to raise them a portion against
they could get them Husbands; but
Christianity corrected those Barbarous
Customs.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AFRICA.</HEAD>
<P>IN most parts she hath scarce plenty
sufficient to maintain Inhabitants,
and where there is, we shall meet
with multitudes of Ravening Beasts,
or other horrible Monsters, enough to
devour both it and us: In a word,
There is no Region of the World so
great an Enemy to Mans Commerce;
there is such scarcity of water, that no
Creature almost could live, had not
Nature provided thereafter, that the
greater part of them endures not drink
in the very midst of Summer: And if
(as sometimes they be enforced by such
as take them) they suddenly perish.
Thus we see how God gives a property
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
to each place, that may make up her
defects, least it should be left as well by
Beasts as Men.</P>
<P>Their Land is full of sandy Desarts,
which lye open to the winds and storms,
and oftentimes are thrown up into Bil∣lows
like Waves of the Sea, and indeed
are no less dangerous. <HI>Strabo</HI> writes, that
<HI>Cambyses</HI> his Army was thus hazarded;
a foolish Nation in <HI>Africa,</HI> as they march∣ed
towards the South, to revenge them∣selves
upon the Winds for drying up
their Rivers, were overwhelmed with
Sand, and so dyed in their Graves. It is
also full of a venemous kind of Ser∣pent,
that in some places they dare not
dress their Lands unless they first fence
their legs with Boots against the sting:
Other wild Creatures there are, which
range about, and possesse to themselves
a great portion of this Countrey, and
make it a Wilderness of Lyons, Leo∣pards,
Elephants; and in some places
Crocodiles, Hyena's, Basilisks, and in∣deed
Monsters without either number
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
or name: <HI>Africa</HI> as it is reported, is full
of danger to the Inhabitants, more dye
by Beasts than by diseases.</P>
<P>But among all these Inconveniences,
Commodities are found of good worth,
and the very evils yield at last their be∣nefit,
both to their own Country and o∣ther
parts of the world: The Elephant
a docible Creature and exceeding useful
for Battel; The Camel which affords
much riches to the <HI>Arabian;</HI> The <HI>Bar∣bary</HI>
Horse, which we our selves com∣mend;
The Ram that besides his flesh
gives twenty pound of wool from his ve∣ry
tail; The Bull, painful and able to
do the best service in their Tillage: And
so most of their worst, alive or dead
yield us their Medicinal parts, which
the world could not well want.</P>
<P>In one of the Divisions of <HI>Africa,</HI>
which is <HI>Fesse</HI> that hath a City in it with
seven hundred Churches, and one of
them a Mile and a half in compass. In
<HI>Morocho</HI> is a Castle of great fame, for
the Globes of pure Gold that stands up∣on
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
the top of it, and weighing 130000.
<HI>Barbary</HI> Duckats.</P>
<P>The Land of <HI>Negro</HI> is full of Gold
and Silver, and other commodities, but
the Inhabitants most barbarous; they
draw their Original from <HI>Chus,</HI> and have
entertained all Religions that came in
their way; first their own, then the
Jews, the Mahumetans, and some of
them the Christian; For the most part
they live not as if Reason guided their
Actions.</P>
<P><HI>Bornaum,</HI> a Country where the people
have no proper Names, no Wives pe∣culiar,
and therefore no Children which

they found there in great abundance.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="31"/>
Fish, Fowl, Hogs, and other things for
sustenance of Man: but no people, nor
any kind of Cattel; Sir <HI>John,</HI> and Sir
<HI>George</HI> having with them 150 Men,
abode there nine Months: Most of

<HI>England,</HI> and making it known to the
<HI>Virginia.</HI> Company, obtained a Char∣ter
from His Majesty, and so hold it.
In Mr. <HI>Richard Moor</HI> the Governours
time, he having spent three years of his
Government, for the most part Forti∣fying
the Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A wonderful
annoyance fell out by silly Rats: These
Rats coming at the first out of a Ship,
few in number, increased in the space
of two years or less so exceedingly, that
they filled not only those places where
they were first Landed. But swimming
from place to place, spread themselves
into all parts of the Country: Inso∣much,
that there was no Island, though
severed by the Sea from all other
Lands, and many Miles distant from the
Isles where the Rats had their Original,
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>
but was pestred with them. They had
their nests almost in every Tree, and in
all places their Burrows in the ground
(like Connies) to harbour in; They
spared not the Fruits of Plants or Trees,
neither the Plants themselves, but eat
them up. When we had set our Corn,
they would commonly come by troops
the night following, or so soon as it be∣gan
to grow, and dig it up again. If by
diligent watching any of it were preser∣ved
till it came to earing, it should then
very hardly scape them; yea, it was a
very difficult matter after they had it in
their Houses, to save it from them; for
they became noy some even to the per∣sons
of Men. They used all diligence
for the destroyng of them, nourishing
many Cats wild and tame for that pur∣pose;
they used Ratsbane, and many
times set fire on the Woods, so as the
fire might run half a Mile or more be∣fore
it were extinct. Every Man in the
Country was enjoyned to set twelve
traps, and some of their own accord set
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>
near a hundred, which they visited
twice or thrice in a night; they trained
up their Dogs to hunt them, wherein
they grew so expert, that a good Dog
in two of three hours space, would kill
forty or fifty Rats: and other means
they used to destroy them, but could
not prevail, finding them still to increase
against them, and continued with them
till almost to the end of
Captain <HI>Tuckers</HI> time (who
was then Governour) but
towards the end of his
time it pleased God (by
what means it is not well known) to
take them away;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>Tucker</HI> succeeded Mr. <HI>Moor</HI> Gover∣nour, arriving in <HI>May</HI> 1616.</NOTE> insomuch that Wild
Cats and many Dogs that lived on
them were famished: Some have attri∣buted
this destruction of them to the
encrease of Wild Cats, some to one
thing, some to another; though none
could positively conclude this, or that.
It remaineth then, as we know God doth
sometimes effect his will without subor∣dinate
and secondary causes, and some∣times
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>
against them: So we need not
doubt but that in the speedy increase
and spreading of these Vermine, as also
in the preservation of so many of them
by such weak means as they then en∣joyed,
and especially in the suddain re∣moval
of this great annoyance there was
joyned with, and besides the ordinary
and manifest means, a more immediate

<HEAD>In the Sommer Islands.</HEAD>
<P>THere is the <HI>Tortoys,</HI> which they
call a Turckle, which having
some affinity and resemblance with
Fishes, Beasts, and Fowls; They are in
the shape of their body like a Crab-fish,
and have four fins, they are as great as
three or four men can carry, the upper
part of them is covered with a great
shell, which they call a Galley patch,
weighing about half a hundred weight,
the Flesh that cleaveth to the inside of
this being Roasted against the Fier, is
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>
excellent Meat, almost like the Marrow
of Beef, but the shell it self harder then
horn; she hath also a shell on her belly
not so hard, but being boyled it beco∣meth
soft, like the sinews or gristle of
Beef, and good Meat. These live in the
Sea, spending the Spring time, and part
of Sommer about these Islands, but the
residue of the year, is not known where.
They are like to Fowl in respect of
smallness, and fashion of their heads and
necks, which are wrinckled like a Tur∣kies,
but white, and not so sharp Billed.
They also breed their young of Eggs
which th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y lay. They resemble Beasts,
in that their flesh is like Veal, but more
hard and solid, and they feed always up∣on
grass growing at the bottom of the
water; neither can they abide any lon∣ger
under water then they hold their
breath, which the old ones will do long,
but the young ones being chased to and
fro, cannot continue two Minutes with∣out
coming up to breathe. Shortly after
their first coming in, the Male and Fe∣male
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>
couple, which is there called Coot∣ing;
this they continue some three days
together, during which time, they will
scarce separate though a Boat come to
them, nor hardly when they are smit∣ten.
Not long after, the she Turckle
comes up by night upon some sandy
Bay, and further up then the water u∣seth
to flow, she digs a hole with her
Fin in the sand some two foot deep, and
there coming up several nights lays her
Eggs; some half a bushel (which are a∣bout
the bigness of a Hens Egg, and
round as a Ball, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch time covers
them with sand very curiously, so that
a Man shall hardly find the place. These
Eggs (as it seems) are afterwards hatch∣ed
by the heat of the Sun, and then by
the providence of God (the means as yet
unknown) are brought out of the
Earth; for they could never perceive
that she returns any more to them, and
yet in likelihood they remain not long in
the Earth after they are hatched, be∣cause
(as is before said) they cannot live
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
without breathing. Sometimes is seen
the young ones no bigger then a Mans
hand, which some Fish will devour.
They grow slowly, and seem to have a
very long life; they'l sleep on the top
of the Water, and were wont to sleep
often on the Land, till the Country was
peopled; they will also live out of the
Water some three weeks, and that
without Meat, but mourn and pine a∣way,
they are very witty. Being on the
Land turned upon their backs, they can
no more without some help or advan∣tage
recover themselves, by which
means when they come on shore to lay
their Eggs, they are easily taken, as al∣so
they are when they are Cooting.
But otherwise they take them for the
most part by night, making a great light
in a Boat, to which they will some∣times
swim, and seldom shun; so that a
Man standing ready with a staffe in his
hand, at one end of which he hath a Soc∣ket,
wherein is an Iron less then a Mans
finger, four-square and sharp, with a
<PB N="51" REF="34"/>
line fastned to it, he striketh this Iron in∣to
the upper shell of the Turckle, it
strikes so fast, that after she hath a lit∣tle
tyred her self by swimming to and
fro she is taken by it. They will live,
the head being cut off four and twenty
hours, so that if you cut the flesh with a
knife, or touch it, it will tremble and
shrink away. There is no meat will keep
longer either fresh or salt.</P>

<P><HI>HAlifax</HI> once called <HI>Horton,</HI> and
touching the alteration of the
name, this pretty story is related of it;
namely, that a Clerk (for so they call
him) being far in Love with a Maid, and
by no means either of long praises or
large promises, able to gain like affection
at her hands: when he saw his hopes
frustrate, and that he was not like to have
his purpose of her, turned his love into
rage, and cut of the Maids head, which
being afterwards hung upon an Ewe
tree, common people counted it as an
hallowed Relique till it was rotten:
And afterward (such was the credulity
<PB N="87" REF="52"/>
of that time) it maintained the opinion
of reverence and Religion still, for the
people resorted thither on Pilgrimage,
and perswaded themselves, that the little
veins that spread out between the bark
and body of the Ewe-tree like fine
threds were the very hairs of the Maids
head: Hereupon it was called by this
name <HI>Haligfax,</HI> or <HI>Haly-fax,</HI> that is, <HI>Ho∣ly-hair.</HI></P>
<P>Under <HI>Knaushrouh</HI> there is a Well
called Dropping-well, in which the
Waters spring not out of the veins of
the earth, but distil and trickle down
from the Rocks that hang over it; it is of

done, the cruel Tyrant, to stop her crys

her head, out of which place did sudden∣ly
arise a Spring that continueth to this

forcible stream and currant, as the like

<P>THe Manners and Customs of the
Wild <HI>Irish</HI> are thus set forth by
<HI>Strabo.</HI> The Inhabitants (saith he) of
<HI>Ireland</HI> are more rude then the <HI>Britains,</HI>
they feed upon the flesh of men; yea,
and think it a point of worth to eat their
dead Parents, wantonly they accompa∣ny
with Women, making no difference
of other mens wives, their own Sisters,
nor of their natural Mothers; but of
these things (saith he) we have no cer∣tain
witness of sufficient credit. <HI>Pompo∣nius
Mela</HI> recordeth, that the <HI>Irish</HI> are
uncivil, ignorant of Vertues, and void
of Religion. And <HI>Solinus</HI> affirmeth, that
after Victory they drink the bloud of
the slain, and besmear their own Faces
therewith, so given to War, that the
mother at the birth of a man-child, feed∣eth
the first meat into her Infants mouth
upon the point of her Husbands sword,
<PB N="111" REF="64"/>
and with heathenish imprecations, wish∣eth
that it may dye no otherwise then
in War, or by sword.</P>
<P>But from these ancient and barbarous
manners, we will come to the conditi∣ons
of their middle time, whom <HI>Giral∣dus
Cambrensis</HI> describeth as followeth.
The <HI>Irish</HI> (saith he) are a strong and bold
people, Martial and Prodigal in War;
nimble, stout and haughty of heart; care∣less
of life, but greedy of glory; courte∣ous
to strangers, constant in Love, light
of belief, impatient of injury, given to
fleshly lusts, and in enmity implacable.
At the baptizing of their Infants, their
manner was, not to dip their right arms
into the water, that so (as they thought)
they might give a more deep and un∣curable
blow, never calling them by the
name of their Parents whilest they li∣ved
together, but at their death took it
upon them: Their Women nursed
not their Children they bare, and they
that nursed others, did affect and love
them much more than their own.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="65"/>
So much were they given to Fanta∣stical
conceits, that they held it very o∣minous
to give their Neighbours Fire
upon <HI>May-day,</HI> to eat an odd Egg;
endangered the death of their Horse▪
And before they cast in their seed, they
sent salt into the field; to hang up the
shells in the roof, was a preservative of
the Chickens from the Kite; to set up
green boughs at their doors in the

in the knots of these allurements. The
men wore Linnen shirts exceedingly
large, stained with Saffron, the sleeves
wide, and hanging to their knees, strait
and short Trusses plated thick in the
skirts, their Breeches close to the thighs,
a short skeine hanging point down be∣fore,
and a Mantle most times cast over
their heads. The women wore their
<PB N="114" REF="66"/>
hair plated in curious manner, hanging
down their backs and shoulders from un∣der
foulden wreaths of fine Linnen, roll∣ed
about their heads, rather loding the
wearer then delighting the beholder;
for as the one was most seemly, so the
other was unsightly, their necks was
hung with Chains and Carkaneths, their
Arms wreathed with many Bracelets,
and over their side garments the Shag
Rug Mantles, purfled with a deep

<P>WE will take notice of their Re∣ligion,
how it is a meer Cou∣zenage
thrust upon the filly people by
the impious subtilty of one <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
whose story is well worth our know∣ledge,
and may cause us to commiserate
the desperate Estate of those ignorant,
yet perverse and bloudy Antichristi∣ans.</P>
<P>His place of Birth is questioned, whe∣ther
he were a <HI>Cirenick,</HI> an <HI>Arabian,</HI> or
<HI>Persian,</HI> it is not yet fully decided; cer∣tain
enough it is he was of base Parents,
his Father (some say) a Worshipper of
Devils, and his Mother a faithless Jew,
betwixt them they sent into the World
a pernicious deceiver (which none but
two such Religions could have made
up.) In the year 597. when he had
been for a while thus instructed by his
<PB N="119" REF="68"/>
distracted Parents, poverty and hope to
improve his Fortunes, perswaded him
from his Native soil, to live for another
while among true professed Christians,
where he received so much knowledge
of the Word, and light of the Gospel,
as to pervert it to his destruction, and
ruine of many Millions of souls.</P>
<P>In his first adventurous travels a∣broad,
he fell into the hands of thee∣vish
<HI>Saracens,</HI> which sold him to a Jew∣ish
Merchant, and he imployed him to
drive his Camels through <HI>Egypt, Syria,
Palestine,</HI> and other forrain Countries,
where he still gathered farther instru∣ctions
of that truth which he intended
to abuse. His wickedness first brake
forth into fraud, open Theft and Ra∣pine,
and other sins of highest rank, in
which he continued and seduced others,
till the death of his Master, and after
marryed his Aged, but rich Mistress.</P>
<P>He had means now to act his malicious
purposes, and wealth to countenance his
exceeding Pride, which would not be
<PB N="120" REF="69"/>
satisfied with a lower Ambition, then to
be called a Prophet of God. This he
began to practice, by the Counsel of one
<HI>Sergius</HI> a Monk, who being cast out for
Heresie from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> betook
himself into <HI>Arabia,</HI> and joyned in with
<HI>Mahomet</HI> to make up this mischief per∣fect:
see now their Juggling. There
wanted no craft betwixt them, to make
use of his worst actions to gull the sim∣ple.
For when by his debaucht drinking
and gluttony, he was fallen into an Epi∣lepsie,
and in his fits lay (Bear like) gro∣velling
and foaming upon the Earth, as
one without sense; he pretended an
Exta-like swoon, wherein his soul was
wrapped from his body, in which he con∣verst
with <HI>Gabriel</HI> an Angel from Hea∣ven.
To make this familiarity with God
the more to be believed, he had bred
up a Dove to take her meat from his ear,
which he most blasphemously professed
to be the Holy Ghost, who in such times
and in that shape infused the prophesies
which he was to preach. Lastly, what
<PB N="121" REF="69"/>
they in their wicked fancies had concei∣ved,
and meant to propagate, they di∣gested
into a Volume, and called it the
Alcoran.</P>
<P>For this too they had a trick, that it
might seem to have been sent from
Heaven into the hands of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and
to this purpose he had himself fed up a
tame Bull, which by custom became so
familliar, that no sooner he heard the
voice of his Master, but he would
straight run, cast the head in his lap, and
use his wanton dalliance as with a Fel∣low.
Betwixt the horns of this Bull, had
he fastned the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and conveyed
him into a by-place, near where he had
assembled the Multitude at a set time,
to expect a wonderful Miracle from
Heaven that might confirm his Prophe∣cy.
The Scene thus ordered, on the
sudden he lift up his voice, and made a
loud cry, which no sooner the beast
heard, but he brake his way through the
Press, over-turned many of the Specta∣tors,
which now stood at a gaze, and
<PB N="122" REF="70"/>
gently laid his horns and book in the bo∣som
of this false couzener, which he with
much ceremony, and feigned Reverence
received, and in their presence opening
the Volume, began to interpret the chief
of their Laws, which for hereafter they
were to observe.</P>
<P>Circumcision he allowed, and with
the old Law forbad Swines flesh, that
he might with more ease lead on such
as were Jewish; he suffered him∣self
to be baptized by <HI>Sergius,</HI> that the
Christian too might have in some mea∣sure
his content: <HI>Moses</HI> and our Savi∣our
he denyed not to be great Pro∣phets,
but that neither party might e∣mulate
the greater observance of other,
and indeed especially that his own
might seem new, and yet take place
from both, he changed the circumsion
of the Jews from the eighth day, and
multiplyes baptism, which can be con∣ferred
but once for all, upon the true
believer. For the like reason of diffe∣rence
with other Nations and Sects, he
<PB N="123" REF="70"/>
left both the Jews Sabbath, and <HI>diem
Christianorum Dominicum,</HI> and com∣mands
his holy ceremonies to be cele∣brated
on the <HI>Friday;</HI> for so it was,
whent he Bull bestowed on him his <HI>Al∣caran.</HI>
Before they enter the Temple,
they wash all the unclean parts of their
bodies, and then to prayer, which must
be performed five times in a day with
their face toward the <HI>South.</HI> They have
a Months fast too once every year, but
it is observed only for the day, for they
may, when the Sun is down, redeem it
with what gluttony they please; Wine
is forbidden, only for a shew that he
might not seem to have loved that
which (he was guilty to himself) had
brought him into his Epileptical fits.
Briefly, what he knew would best agree
with the brutish desires of the people,
that he took order should be confirmed
by his Laws, four or five Wives to eve∣ry
Husband, and as many Concubines as
they could maintain. For their bliss af∣ter
life, he proposed no invisible de∣lights
<PB N="124" REF="71"/>
which over reacht their under∣standing,
but proportioned to each of
their sensual thoughts. And promised
to those which would keep his Law a
Paradise of all kinds of pleasure, which
they themselves most affected, to the
covetous wealth, to the ambitious Ho∣nours,
to the gluttenous Meats, to the
Virgins rich attire, and embraces of An∣gels,
the poor souls were never so fitted;
and when he had thus for a long time
discoursed over his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> he took a
yoak from <HI>Sergius,</HI> and put it upon the
Bulls neck; for it was fore-told by an
Inscription brought by his door, that
whosoever could yoke the Bull, it
should be a sign to declare the man, as
one sent from God, to govern his peo∣ple.</P>
<P>This huddle of Miracles put the Ga∣zers
beyond all pause, so that in an in∣stant
they cryed him up King, and held
his companion in Reputation of a minor
Prophet, called themselves <HI>Musulmanni;</HI>
true believers, which the <HI>Turk</HI> still af∣fects,
<PB N="125" REF="71"/>
rather than his right name of <HI>Turk,</HI>
which imports banishment, and unpraids
him the disgrace of his Original.</P>
<P>And now he hath past the difficulty
of his attempt, an easie matter to draw
on Millions of followers, such as would
like that Religion best which baulkt not
their pleasures; yet at last he met with
an end answerable to his beginning, for
he was poysoned by some of his own Fa∣mily.</P>
<P>He had long before prophesied, that
he should be wonderfully conveyed to
Heaven, and to make good his Fraud,
had framed an Iron Chest for his Sepul∣chre,
which he purposed should have
been held up by force of a Load-stone
placed in the top of the Temple, and by
this means have appeared to the behol∣der
to hang in the Air without any sup∣port.
But this trick (it seems) was pre∣vented
by death, yet they expected still
his ascent to Heaven, till he stank upon
Earth, so that at last they were forced
to convey him into his Iron Coffin,
<PB N="126" REF="72"/>
which remains to this day in <HI>Mecha</HI> a
City of <HI>Persia,</HI> and is visited by the

of Inhabitants: It is now a vast
Empire, and without doubt, as they are
infinitely populous, so they are propor∣tionably
Rich, beyond any other Na∣tion
of the World. Their principal

yet besides these, they send forth

<P>The men are in their several imploy∣ments
infinitely laborious, and ingenu∣ous:
<PB N="127" REF="72"/>
it is very rare to see any of them in
a strange Country, nor will they easily
admit a stranger far into theirs; they
are addicted much to Manual Arts, for
they have excellent practick Wits, and
indeed for that go beyond any other
Nation: Much quarrel hath been about
the invention of Guns and Printing,
which several people have been ambi∣tious
to take to themselves, as the
Master-piece of Mans wit; but with∣out
doubt they were both used here,
long before any of Europe pretended to
the knowledge of either. In their wri∣tings,
they make not their Lines from
the Right hand to the left, as the <HI>He∣brews,</HI>
nor from the left to the right as
we do, but from the top to the bottom
of the page, and use all one Character
through the whole Kingdom. Their
special skill, which we much admire, but
cannot imitate, is in making the Pur∣slain
dishes white as very Snow, and
transparent as Glass, formed up only of
Cockles found in the Sea-shore, mixt
<PB N="128" REF="73"/>
with Egg shells, but lye buryed in the
Earth many years before they come to
perfection, and are seldom took up by
the same Artificer, which kneads them,
but are left as a portion to some of his
Posterity.</P>
<P>When they travel over the Plains,
they use a kind of Coach, yet not drawn
with Horses or other Beast, but driven
with the Wind under-sail as a Bark on
the Sea, which the people are as perfect
to guide which way they please, as the
Mariner is to direct his course unto any
Coast whither he is bound; as they sail
upon Land, as if it were Sea; so they
dwell as frequent upon the Sea, as if it
were Land; for they have an incredible
number of ships and Boats, which are in
many places ranked like streets upon
the Waters, and filled with Inhabitants,
such as are here born, live, traffick, mar∣ry,
and die. Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> Reports that

Land is not sufficient, but is forced to
borrow room out of the Sea, for their
habitation. Yet are they all governed
by one Monarch, whom they call the
Lord of the World, and Son to the
Sun. In matters of State they are very
Politick, in Peace wary, and in War Va∣liant,
crafty and excellent Engineers.</P>
<P>Their Laws are for the most part just,
and severely executed, especially against
idle drones which set not a hand to ad∣vance
their State, or maintain them∣selves;
they will not cherish the very
blind by Alms, since without eyes a
man may be fit for some corporal im∣ployment;
but to the maimed and
lame, they deny not a charitable main∣tenance;
the Son is bound to exercise
his Parents occupation, so that no pre∣tense
almost is left for Wonderers: and
briefly, as far as humane Laws can pro∣vide,
all other vain occasions, for mis∣expence
of time are taken off; for
<PB N="130" REF="74"/>
within the Cities no stews are allow'd, or
lewd persons to withdraw them, Adul∣tery
is punished with death, but yet they
have liberty to take many Wives, one
they keep at home, the rest are disposed
of abroad, where they best please. Their
Marriages they chiefly solemnize at the
New Moon, and for the most part in
<HI>March,</HI> which begins their year.</P>
<P>For their Religion, they are <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
but have a confused knowledge of God,
Heaven, and the Creation: When they
would decipher their great God, they
express him by the first Letter in their
Alphabet, and in their Devotions; they
worship him as their chief (but not on∣ly)
preserver, for they have their pray∣ers
to the Sun, Moon, Stars, and to the
Devil himself, that he would not hurt
them. Their Priests are distinguished
into the black and White Friers as we
call them, for they much resemble Fri∣ers
in their course of life, some are cloath∣ed
in White, their heads shorn, and
their Victuals in common; others in

contains 100 miles in compass, it is seat∣ed
in a low and Fenny ground, is subject
to floods, and hath been forced in very
many places, to erect bridges for free
passage from one street to another;
there are in all 12000. built of stone,
and most of them so high, that a good
ship may strike under them with full
sail, each of them hath its ten for a
night guard. The Inhabitants of this
City live luxuriously, especially their
Women, who are much more comely
then their men; yet all of them almost
eat both Horse and Dogs flesh. Toward
the South part of the City, there is a
great lake about 24 miles in circuit, in
the midst stand two Islands, whither the
chief Nobilty repair and invite their
friends to Solemnize their Marriage, and
have in each a stately Pallace erected,
furnished sufficiently with all fitting Or∣naments
for a Wedding jollity. In ma∣ny
parts of the City there are publick

places of Receipt; for such as sustain
any misfortune by fire, there they may
lodge their Goods safe upon a suddain
casualty, till they can make better pro∣vision.</P>
<P>In each Province the Cities stand so
thick, and are so populous, that they all
seem to be as one, one as well for their
continued building almost as their fa∣shion
of building; for they all observe
the same form, and dispose their streets
alike, two broad, crossing each other in
the middle in so strait a line, that the

<P>THese <HI>Tartaryans,</HI> for brutish Cu∣stoms,
were grown odious to the
more civil parts of the World, and as
(<HI>Herod</HI> in his fourth Book of Histories

to the Grave, invite their best
Friends to Feast with their Fathers
flesh, and use his Scull, as a cup to drink
in at their lascivious banquets. Who
more the <HI>Axiaca,</HI> who quenched their
thirst with the bloud of him, whom
they first slew, as it gushed warm from
his wounds; who more foolish proud
than the <HI>Agathyrst,</HI> who were used to
mend their beauty by a deformed paint∣ing,
and ugly staining of their bodies
with motly colours.</P>
<P>You shall have here their Character,
which is given by most that describe
them, to have ill fashioned bodies, an∣swerable
<PB N="135" REF="76"/>
to their rude minds, fit houses
for so unclean guests.</P>
<P>Their Stature is different. The most
part have large shoulders, a broad face,
with a crooked nose, deformed counte∣nance,
swarthy colour, hollow eyes, hai∣ry
and untrimmed beard, and head close
shaved. Their speech is boisterous, and
clamorous, their noise in singing, like the
yell of Wolves, and endurance of hun∣ger,
thirst, heat, cold and watching e∣quals
them (in strength of body) to the
most able beast, for it exceeds the com∣mon
power of a man. Their lust is with∣out
Law, for they except no kindred,
but their own Mothers, Daughters, and
Sisters. No species, for they mix with
beasts; nor sex, for they are unsatiate
<HI>Sodomites;</HI> and yet take liberty for as
many Wives which they can maintain,
which (contrary to our civil courses) they
buy of their Parents, instead of recei∣ving
Dowries. Their meat is the raw
flesh of horses, without regard how they
were killed, or what diseases they dyed;
<PB N="136" REF="77"/>
sometimes they suck bloud from the li∣ving,
to appease their hunger and thirst,
if (in a journey) they be distressed for
want of food.</P>
<P>Cities they have but few, nor hou∣ses
other then moveable Tents made of
Beasts skins, which they pitch up by
great multitudes in the form of a Town,
and those are called hordes: when the
Grass is once eaten bare, and the ground
yields not meat for their Cattel, they
trudge with bag and baggage to another
quarter, and so in course they wander
through the vast Desarts unsetled, and
indeed impatient to be setled, or rather
imprisoned (as they take it) within any
bounded compass, having the wide
world to roam in: Their chief Arms are
Bow and Arrows, which they use most
on Horse-back, for their most speedy
flight, and have them commonly strong∣ly
poysoned, for the more sure mischief
to the foe; their stratagems are down∣right
fraud, and breach of truce, for they
keep no faith with an Enemy, regard
<PB N="137" REF="77"/>
not any compact made upon terms of
peace, but follow their own sense, and
commit what out-rages they can with
least danger to themselves.</P>
<P>Their Religion is answerable to their
vile customs; Some are Pagans, others
Mahometans, yet will not be called
<HI>Turks,</HI> but <HI>Bersemany,</HI> and their chief
Priest <HI>Seyd,</HI> whom they reverence more
then their Maker, and admit none shall
touch his hand but their Kings; and
these too with an humble gesture, their
Dukes aspire not above his knee, nor
the Nobles higher then his feet, the
rest are happy if they can but reach at
his garment, his Horse, his any thing;
so simple are they in their superstition.
And thus have they continued either
Atheists or false Idolaters, ever since
the first entrance upon this Kingdom in
the year 1187. Before they were not
esteemed a Nation at all, but wild peo∣ple,

and sparkling with the Sun-beams; they
did affirm to him to be Gold, the truth
of which he doubted.</P>
<P>From thence in his Travels, he came
to a Town called <HI>Halverstadt,</HI> which
belongs to a Bishop so styled, who is
Duke <HI>Christian</HI> Brother to the now
Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> a long <HI>Dutch</HI> mile
(or almost six English) is a small Town
called <HI>Groning</HI> belonging to the Duke:
In which place he observed,</P>
<P>First a most stately Pallace built with
a beautiful Chappel, so adorned with
the Images and Forms of Angels and
Cherubims, with such exquisiteness of
Arts best Industry of Carving, Graving,
<PB N="141" REF="79"/>
Guilding, Painting, Glazing, and Pa∣ving,
with such super-excellent Work∣man-ship
of Organs, Pulpit, and Font,
that for Curiosity and admirable Rare∣ness,
all the buildings (he saith) and Fa∣bricks
that ever he beheld, must give it
preheminence; he confesseth that <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the sevenths Chappel at <HI>Westminster,</HI>
Kings Colledge Chappel in <HI>Cambridge,</HI>
and <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> are be∣yond
it in height and Workman-ship of
Stone; for indeed this Chappel is most
of Wood, Gippe, and Plaister of Paris,
but it is so guilded, as if it had been
made in the Golden age, when Gold
was esteemed as Dross, so that a man
had need to wear a vaile over his daze∣ling
eyes, or else he can hardly look up∣on
it.</P>
<P>In this Church there is no Service:
If the painted Pulpit could preach, the
Images might (perhaps) have a Sermon
now and then, for scarce at any time
there comes any body into the Chap∣pel,
but a fellow that shews the beauty
of it for 2<HI>d.</HI> or 3<HI>d.</HI> a piece.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="80"/>
In the same house, in a place or Cel∣ler
built of purpose, is a great Tun, or
Vessel of Wood, that was seven years in
making, and was used to be filled with
Rhenish-Wine, it is said to be twice as
big as the Vessel at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> and the
hoops of it are twelve inches thick,
the staves or boards of it being as much;
they go up to the top of it with a Lad∣der
of 18 steps, he that keeps it, saith it
will hold 160 Tunnes.</P>
<Q><L>This is a Tub of Tubs, Tub of Tubs hall;</L>
<L>Who ne're had fellow yet, nor ever shall.</L></Q>
<P>From hence passing through many
Towns, and inaccessible mountains, he
and his company came to a Wood,
which parts <HI>Bohemia</HI> from <HI>Saxony</HI> on the
<HI>West,</HI> which Wood is called by the peo∣ple
of those parts the <HI>Beamer Wolts,</HI> or
<HI>Wolt,</HI> and is in breadth ten English miles,
but in length farther than to be descri∣bed
by him truly: Thus much is affirm∣ed,
that it is a natural impregnable Wall
<PB N="143" REF="80"/>
to the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which
Kingdom is all incompast round with
Woods and mountains, so that there
is no passage on that side of it for an Ar∣my
to enter into it with Munition and
Artillery, all the wayes being uneven,
and the mountain tops all Bogs, Mosses,
and Quagmires; besides, there are num∣bers
past numbring of Firre-trees, many
standing, and such store fallen of them∣selves,
that any passage might easily be
stopped by laying them cross the way;
a most dismal Wood it is, the trees
grow so thick, and so high, that the Sun
is obscured, and the day seemeth
night.</P>
<P>When they had past the Hills and
Woods, and that they might look down
the Mountains, into the fruitful Land of
<HI>Bohemia,</HI> never did sight more rejoyce
them, the lower hills being all full of
Vineyards, and the Valleys, Corn and
Pasture, not an English mile distance, but
a Village every way, and twenty, thirty,
or fourty ricks or stacks of Corn (which
<PB N="144" REF="81"/>
their Barns cannot hold) in the space of
every hours journey: In a word, every
thing that belonged to the use and
Commodity of man was and is there,
and all the delightful objects to satisfie
every sense is there abundantly, so that
nature seemed to make that Country
her Store-house or Granary, for there
is nothing wanting, except mens grati∣tude
to God for such blessings. Then they
came to <HI>Prague,</HI> which long lookt for
City, could not be seen until they came
within an hours travel of it; within half
a Dutch mile is a fearful place, being
frequented with inhumane and barba∣rous
murderers, that assault travellers,
but if they chance at any time to be
apprehended, they are racked and tortu∣red
to make them confess, and after∣wards
their Executions are very terrible:
In their journey they saw above seven∣score
Gallowses and wheels, where
thieves were hanged, some fresh, and
some half rotten, and the carkasses of
murtherers broken Limb after Limb on
the wheels.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="81"/>
When they were come to <HI>Prague,</HI>
which was but two days after a most
fearful execution of two notorious Of∣fenders;
the manner how, with their
faults, as it was truly related to them
by English Gentelmen that saw it, I
shall relate it. The one of them being
taken, apprehended and racked, for
ripping up a live Woman with Child,
and for taking the Infant out of her bo∣dy,
did sow a living puppy into her bel∣ly,
all which he confessed he did to
make properties for Witchcraft; and be∣ing
further tortured, he confessed when
&amp; where he had committed 35 murthers
more. The other in respect of him was
but a petty offender, for he in all his
life-time had murthered but 14. for
the which execrable facts, their deser∣ved
executions were as followeth. First,
they were brought out of the Goal na∣ked
from the girdle upward, and so be∣ing
bound fast on high in a Cart, that
the Spectators might see them, then the
hangman having a pan of Coals near
<PB N="146" REF="82"/>
him, with red hot pincers nip'd of the
nipple of one breast, then he took a
knife and gives him a slash or cut down
the back on one side from the shoulder
to the waste, and presently gave him
such another slash, three inches from the
first, then on the top he cut the slashes
into one, and presently taking pincers,
took hold of the cross cut, and tore him
down like a Girse below the middle,
letting it hang down behind him like a
belt, after which he took his burning
pincers, and pluck'd off the tops of his
fingers of one hand; then passing to ano∣ther
place of the Town, his other nipple
was plucked off, the other side of his
back so cut and mangled, (which they
call by the name of rimming) his other
fingers nip'd off; then passing further, all
his Toes were nip'd off with the burning
pincers, after which he was inforced to
come out of the Cart, and go on foot
up a steep hill to the Gallows, where he
was broken with a wheel alive, one bone
after another, beginning at his leggs,
<PB N="147" REF="82"/>
and ending with his neck, and last of all
quartered and laid on the Wheel, on a
high post, till Crows, Ravens, or con∣suming
time consume him.</P>
<P>This was the manner of both their
executions, but I speak of the greatest
murther particularly, because it is re∣ported
that all these torments never
made him once to change countenance,
or to make any sign or action of grief, to
call to God for mercy, or to intreat the
people to pray for him, but as if he had
been a sensless stock or stone, he did
most scornfully, and as it were in disdain
abide it; whilst the other Villain did cry,
rore, and make lamentation, calling up∣on
God often. The difference was not
much in their lives, and manner of their
deaths, but the odds may be great in
their dying.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Prague</HI> is said to be of
Churches and Chappels 150. I was
there at four several sorts of divine ex∣ercise,
<HI>viz.</HI> at good Sermons with the
Protestants, at Mass with the Papists,
<PB N="148" REF="83"/>
at a Lutherans preaching, and at the Jews
Synagogue, three of which I saw and
heard for curiosity, and the other for E∣dification.
The Jews in <HI>Prague</HI> are in such
great numbers, that they are thought
to be of Men, Women, and Children
betwixt 50 or 60000. who do all live
by Brokage and Usury upon the Chri∣stians,
and are very rich in Money and
Jewels, so that a man may see 10 or 12
together of them, that are accounted
worth 20 30 or 40000 <HI>l.</HI> a piece, and
yet the slaves go so miserably attired,
that 15 of them are not worth the hang∣ing
for their whole ward-ropes.</P>

<HEAD>The City of Hamburgh.

<P>YOu must understand that this fel∣low

whom our Tyburn Tatterdemallion, or
our <HI>Wapping</HI> winde-pipe stretcher, is
but a Raggamuffin, not worth the

haulter-master are many, as he hath the
emptying of all the Vaults or draughts
in the City, which no doubt he gains
some favour by. Besides all Oxen,
Kine, Horses, Dogs, or any such beasts,
if they dye themselves, or if they be
not like to live, the hang man must
knock them on the head, and have
their skins; and whatsoever Inhabitant
in his jurisdiction doth any of these
things aforesaid himself, is abhorred and
accounted as a Villain without Redemp∣tion:
So that with hangings, headings,
breakings, pardoning, and killing of
Dogs, flaying of Beasts, emptying of
Vaults, and such privy Commodities,
his whole Revenue sometimes amounts
to four or five hundred pounds a year.
And he is held in that regard and estima∣tion,
that any man will converse and
drink with; nay, sometimes the Lords
of the Town will feast with him, and it
is accounted no impeachment to their
honours, for he is held in the rank of a
<PB N="150" REF="84"/>

he scorns to be clad in the cast weeds of

<HEAD>Their manner of executing Thieves and
Murtherers upon the Wheel▪ I shall name
one for a president.</HEAD>
<P>A Poor Carpenter dwelling in the
Town, who having stoln a Goose,
and plucking it within his doors, a little
Girl (his Daughter-in-law) went out of
his house, and left the door open, by
which means, the owner of the Goose
passing by, espyed the wretched thief
<PB N="151" REF="84"/>
very diligently picking what he before
had been stealing, to whom the owner
said, Neighbour, I now perceive which
way my Geese use to go, but I will
have you in Question for them, and so
away he went; the Caitiff being thus
reproved, grew desperate, and his Child
coming into his house, ye young whore,
quoth he, must ye leave my door open
for folks to look in upon me, and with
that word he took a hatchet, and with a
cursed stroak, he clove the Childs head,
for the which murther he was condem∣ned
and judged to be broken alive upon
the wheel. Upon the day of Execution,
about the hour of 12 at Noon, the peo∣ple
of the Town in great multitudes
flocked to the place of Execution, which
is half a mile English without the Gates,
the Prisoner came on foot with a Divine
with him, all the way exhorting him to
repentance; and because death should
not terrifie him, they had given him
many Rowses, and Carowses of Wine
and Beer; for it is a custom there to make
<PB N="152" REF="85"/>
such poor wretches drunk, whereby they
be made sensless, either of Gods mercy,
or their own misery, but being pray'd for
by others, they themselves may die re∣solutely,
or (to be feared) desperate∣ly.</P>
<P>But the Prisoner being come to the
place of death, he was by the Officers
delivered to the hang-man, who entring
his strangling fortification with two
grand hang-men more, and their men, to
assist their <HI>Hamburghian</HI> brother in this
great and weighty work; the Prisoner
mounted on a mount of Earth, built
high on purpose that the people about
may see the execution a quarter of a
mile round about, four of the hang-mens
men takes each of them a small
halter, and by the hands and the feet
they hold the prisoner extended all
abroad lying on his back, then the
Arch-hang-man, or the great Master
of this mighty business, took up a wheel
much about the bigness of one of the
fore, wheels of a Coach, and first having
<PB N="153" REF="85"/>
put off his Doublet, his Hat, and being
in his shirt, as if he meant to play at
Tennis, he took the wheel, and set it on
the edge, and turn'd it with one hand
like a Top or Whirly-gig; then he
took it by the Spoaks, and lifting it up,
with a mighty stroke, he beat one of the
poor wretches legs in pieces (the bones
I mean) at which he rored grievously,
then after a little pause he breaks the o∣ther
leg in the same manner, and conse∣quently
breaks his arms, and then he
stroke four or five main blows on his
breast, and burst all his bulk and chest
in shivers; lastly, he smote his neck, and
missing, burst his chin and Jaws to mam∣mocks,
then he took the broken man∣gled
Corps, and spread it on the wheel,
and then fixed the post into the Earth
some six foot deep, being in height a∣bove
the ground some ten or twelve
foot, and there the carkass must lye till
it be consumed by all consuming time,
or ravening fowls.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="86"/>
This was the terrible manner of the
horrid Execution; and at this place are
twenty posts with those wheels or pie∣ces
of wheels, with heads of men nailed
on the top of the posts; with a great
spike driven through the skull. The
several kinds of torments which they
inflict upon offenders in those parts, puts
me to imagine our English hanging to
be but a flea-biting.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>There manner of beheading.</HEAD>
<P>MOreover, if any men in those
parts are to be beheaded, the
fashion is, that the prisoner
kneels down, and being blinded with a
Napkin, one takes hold of the hair of
the crown of the head, holding the
party upright, whilst the hangman with
a backward blow with a sword, will take
the head from a mans shoulders so nim∣bly,
and with such dexterity, that the
owner of the head shall never want the
<PB N="155" REF="86"/>
miss of it. And if it be any mans fortune
to be hanged for never so small a crime,
though he be mounted whole, yet he
shall come down in pieces, for he shall
hang till every joynt and limb drop one
from another.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Strange Torments and varieties of deaths.</HEAD>
<P>THey have strange torments and
varieties of deaths, according to
the various nature of the offences that
are committed; as for example, he
that counterfeits any Princes Coin, and
is proved a Coiner, his judgment is to
be boiled to death in Oil; not thrown
into the Vessel all at once, but with a
pulley or a rope, to be hanged under the
Arm-pits, and let down into the Oil by
degrees; first the feet, and next the
legs, and so to boil his flesh from the
bones alive. For those that set houses
on fire wilfully, they are smoaked to
death; as first there is a pile or post fix∣ed
<PB N="156" REF="87"/>
in the ground, and within an English
Ell of it is a piece of Wood nailed cross,
whereupon the offender is made fast sit∣ting,
then over the top of the post is
whelmed a great tub or dry fat, which
doth cover or over-whelm the prisoner
as low as the middle. Then underneath
the executioner hath wet straw, hay,
stubble, or such kind of stuffe, which is
fired, but by reason it is wet and dank,
it doth not burn, but smother and
smoak, which smoak ascends up into the
Tub, where the prisoners head is, and
not being able to speak, he will heave up
and down with his belly, and people
may perceive him in these torments to
live three or four hours.</P>
<P>Adultery there if it be proved, is
punished with death, as the loss of the
parties heads, if they be both marryed,
or if not both, yet the marryed party
must die for it, and the other must en∣dure
some easier punishment, either by
the purse or carkasse, which in the end
proves little better then half a hang∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="87"/>
One thing more: In <HI>Ham∣burgh</HI>
those that are not hanged for
theft, are chained two or three toge∣ther,
and they must in that sort six or
seven years draw a dung-cart, &amp; cleanse
the streets of the Town, and every one
of those thieves for as many years as he
is condemned to that slavery, so many
bells he hath hanged at an Iron above
one of his shoulders, and every year a
bell is taken off, till all are gone, and then
he is a free-man again, some of the
thieves had seven bells, some five, some
six, some one, but such a noise they
make, as if all the Devils in hell were
dancing the Morrice.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A Pretty Story.</HEAD>
<P>THe Hangmans place being void,
there were two of the bloud (for
it is to be noted that the succession of
the office doth lineally descend from
the Father to the Son, or to the next
<PB N="158" REF="88"/>
of the bloud) which were at strife for
the possession of this high indignity.
Now it happened that two men were to
be beheaded at the same Town, and at
the same time, and (to avoid suit in
Law for this great Prerogative) it was
concluded by the Arbitrators, that
each of these new hangmen should exe∣cute
one of the prisoners, and he that
with greatest cunning and slight could
take the head from the body, should
have the place; to this they all agreed,
and the prisoners were brought forth,
where one of the executioners did bind
a Red silk thred double about his priso∣ners
neck, the threds being distant one
from another but the breadth of one
thred, and he promised to cut off the
head with a backward blow with a
sword, between the threds. The other
called his prisoner aside, and told him
that if he would be ruled by him, he
should have his life saved, and besides
(quoth he) I shall be sure to have the
office. The prisoner was glad of the
<PB N="159" REF="88"/>
motion, and said he would do any thing
upon these conditions, then said the
hang-man, when thou art on thy
knees, and hast said thy prayers, and that
I do lift up my Axe (for I will use an
Axe) to strike thee, I will cry <HI>Hem,</HI> at
which word do thou rise and run away
(thou knowest none will stay thee if
thou canst once escape after thou art de∣livered
into my custody; it is the fashion
of our Country) and let me alone to
shift to answer the matter. This being
said or whispered, the heads-man with
the sword did cut off the prisoners head
just between the threds as he had said,
which made all the people wonder at
the steddiness of his hand, and most of
them judged that he was the man that
was and would be fittest to make a mad
hang-man of.</P>
<P>But as one tale is good till another
be told, and as there be three degrees
of good, better and best, so this last
hang-man did much exceed and eclipse
the others cunning; For his prisoner be∣ing
<PB N="160" REF="89"/>
on his knees, and he lifting up his
Axe to give the fatal blow, <HI>Hem</HI> (said
he according to promise) whereupon
the fellow arose and ran away, but when
he had run some seven or eight paces,
the hang-man threw the Axe after him,
and struck his head smoothly from his
shoulders: Now for all this, who shall
have the place is unknown, for they are
yet in Law for it, and I doubt not but
before the matter is ended, that the
Lawyers will make them exercise their
own Trade upon themselves to end the
controversie. This tale doth savour
somewhat Hyperbolical, but I wish the
Reader to believe to more of the matter
than I saw, and there is an end.</P>

<P>These are the Theames of my
mournful Muse, these are the grounds of
my Lamentation; <HI>Josephus</HI> wrote these
things in ample manner, which I do here
Epitomize. That worthy Author in a
large scope relates, and the Books of his
Antiquities do tell his Countries altera∣tions,
how oftentimes they rose how of∣ten
they fell, how often God favoured
them, and how often his frowns was up∣on
them, and at last in his anger he cast
them head-long down.</P>
<P>The seventh Book of <HI>Josephus</HI>'s wars,
declareth plainly how the <HI>Romans</HI> did
by Conquest gain the Kingdom, how
death did in sundry shapes tyrannize,
both in Sword, in Fire, in Famine, and
in Rapes.</P>
<P>Since <HI>Hebers</HI> Sons enjoyed the Coun∣try,
it hath been six times wasted and

the Wars since the Creation that hath

desolation: No story, no Memory de∣scribes
the calamity of old <HI>Israels</HI> Tribes
to be parallel'd: And indeed if each
Land in the universal did recount the
bloudy broyls to them, it were but a
Molehill to a Mountain; all which for
sin, the Almighty in his anger heaped
upon this sinful Land.</P>
<P>It is now about sixteen hundred years

and with a Royal Army renown∣ed,
did beleaguer <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with Forces

scaling Ladders and Towers, with
all the Art that either might or sleight
could do.</P>
<P>The besieged amongst themselves, in

that lyeth near one to another, if one
burn, and burning, each one burneth
another; so did the <HI>Jews</HI> each other

each scorned another, and would not by
any be ruled or over-born.</P>
<P>The City being thus divided into
three Factions, sad it is to relate how
horrid their bloudy and inhumane acti∣ons
were, there all impieties were com∣mitted
in sundry sorts of varieties, all
sacrilegious acts were counted most no∣ble

strived each other to surpass, and labour∣ed
most how to serve the Devil. These

most madly fought, and over-turn∣ed
all things by their hurly burly, so
violent were they one against another,
<PB N="169" REF="93"/>
that they burned each others store∣houses,
with their Victuals: And with
hearts more harder than the Adamantine
Rocks, they drailed Virgins by the hair
of their heads, as also the Aged they
spared not to drag about the streets,
some Infants their brains they dashed
out, and some upon the points of Lances,
they bore about the streets: It is not
possible to write with Pen, the devillish
out-rages, and barbarous acts that was
committed by them.</P>
<P>The advantage upon this seditious
and most inhumane disorder that the
<HI>Romans</HI> took, is most incredible; yet
credible it may be, because the <HI>Jews</HI>
were altogether unmindful of their own
safety, they wasted and spoiled one
another without remorse, insomuch as
their enemies, their cruel foes, relented
and wept in pity of them, whilst they
(relentness Villains) void of pity; did
their Mother City consume and ruinate,
the Channels flowed all with gore
bloud, the streets were bestrowed with
<PB N="170" REF="94"/>
murdered carkasses, the Temple with
unhallowed hands defiled; there was no
respect to any, to Man, Woman, or
Child.</P>
<P>Thus this three headed multitude,
or hellish crew did waste themselves,
till indeed they did at length subdue
themselves: but you must note they
were not altogether neglective, some vi∣gilancy
they had upon their enemy, and
whilst they were making their strength
more sure within, the <HI>Romans</HI> with∣out
with their dreadful Batteries,
made not only the City to tremble,
but the Walls to break, at which the
factious wisely bethought themselves,
and assembled themselves together
with all their powers; and, as a won∣derment
it was united together like
good friends: And then like swoln Ri∣vers
bounded in with Banks, they sally
forth and fight their enemies, like as the
ambitious torrent breaks his bounds, and
over-runs whole Lordships; so did
these <HI>Jews</HI> out-dare and challenge any
<PB N="171" REF="94"/>
that would withstand the fury of their
insulting pride, whereupon they out of
the City came, and entred the <HI>Romans</HI>
Army like a flood, and in their despe∣rate
madness, all was overwhelmed that
durst withstand them; the Walls then
could not be assaulted, the enemies
fearful Engines was then by them set on
fire, and bravely fighting they bravely
made their enemies to retire!</P>
<P>The Battel done, back go these hair∣braind
men, and divide again, and each
becomes the others foe, and then pell
mell they go to it, and begin to disor∣der,
and bring all things to confusion;
with fire their Corn and Victuals they
consumed, all their provision in a mo∣ment
spoiled and wasted, which if well
kept, might have lasted them many
years; upon which the Famine, like a
Tyrant, roams and rages, and makes
all, both Old and Young, Rich and
Poor to starve and dye with fleshless A∣natomies.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="95"/>
This was a Plague of Plagues, a Woe
of Woes, death on every side did in∣close
them; this being their condition,
they knew not what to do, to sally forth
they durst not, for then their lives they
were sure to lose, to stay within for
want of food they starved, out they
could not go, for the Gates were shut
and strongly warded, their throats were
cut if any staid within; so that if they
stay or go, or go or stay, every way De∣struction
they are sure to meet with.</P>
<P>But of all torments, hunger is the
worst, for that will burst through the
stony Walls; therefore these people
having been with War, Woe, and want
on every side beset, do now begin to con∣sult
and strive how they might get to the
<HI>Romans,</HI> for there was their hopes, that
in their swords they should find more
mercy, then their still dying famisht
state afforded them: And indeed when
man is opprest, then is wit most sharpest,
and then wisdom amongst evils, chuseth
the least.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="95"/>
Now they knowing <HI>Vespasian</HI> for a
noble Prince, and one that did not glo∣ry
in their Woe, they thought it best
to try his clemency, and not with hun∣ger
and famine to die, and therefore de∣spairing
of all hopes, resolved with
Ropes to slide down the Walls, which
a number of them did, and fled to <HI>Titus,</HI>
who bemoaned the sadness of their con∣dition,
and relieved and took them to
his grace and favour. Thus when
all hopes failed, they were by their foes
preserved, to the number of at least
40000.</P>
<P>The City Souldiers searched every
house where they thought any Victuals
were conveyed, and if they found
any, the owners were most certainly bea∣ten
for concealing it; but if they saw a
man look plump and fat, his throat they
would surely cut, for they thought
him too much pampered, and too full
fed; they would therefore strike him
dead to save meat and drink. The
Richest and Noblest that was born both
<PB N="174" REF="96"/>
of Men and Women, gave all they had
for one poor strike of Corn, and hid
themselves and it under the ground in
some close Vault, and there they would
eat it under the ground unground; if
any could get flesh, they would eat it
raw: Thus the weaker were over-awed,
and kept under by the stronger.</P>
<P>No respect of persons where hunger
came; natural affection was then banish∣ed;
then the Husband did his own Wife
reject, the Wife she snatches the meat
from her Husband, all pity from the
Mother was exiled, she from the Child
tears and takes the Victuals, the Child
plays the thief with the Parents, and
steals the food, though with grief the
Parents pine away.</P>
<P>There was neither Free-man, nor
Bond-man, Fathers nor Mothers, Wives,
Husbands, Masters, Servants, Brothers,
Sisters, be it propinquity or strong affi∣nity,
no Law, or reason, or rule could
bear sway; and indeed obeysance must
be given where strength commands; the
<PB N="175" REF="96"/>
pining Servant will not know his Ma∣ster,
the Son will not shew his duty to
his Father, the Commons regardless to
the Magistrate, each for one, and but
for one he cared; disordered, like the
cart before the horse, force caused all
respect to yield.</P>
<P>These Miscreants with vigilancy did
watch where a door was locked or latch∣ed
that they could spy, for there they
supposed the people were at meat, and
in their out-rage the doors they would
beat open, where entring if they found
them feeding, they would tear it in
haste out of their throats, half eaten
and half uneaten; these wretches would
constrain the people to cast it up again,
they hauld them about the house by the
ears, to force them to bring out their
Victuals, which they supposed they had;
some by the Thumbs they hanged up,
and some by the Toes, some had many
blows, others were pricked with Bod∣kins,
sadly were they tormented to re∣veal
their meat when they had none to
<PB N="176" REF="97"/>
conceal; and in truth all was fish that
came into their net, and all was food
that could be got by fraud or force.</P>
<P>Grass, Hay, Barks, Leaves of trees,
Cats and Dogs, Frogs, Worms, Rats,
Mice, Snails, Flies and Maggots, all
stinking and contagious roots, the cover∣ing
of their Coaches, Boots and Shoes,
and the dung of Fowls and Beasts, were
Feasts for these poor miserable starved
wretches; things loathsome to be na∣med
in time of plenty, is now dainties
among these starved distressed <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>This Famine run beyond all natures
bounds, (as before I have hinted) and
confounded all Motherly-affection, no
compassion was there had to bloud or
birth: It forced a woman to kill her on∣ly
Son, she ript and dis-joynted him, and
dis-joynted him limb from limb, she
drest, she roasted, she broiled and boil∣ed
him, she eat him, she interr'd him in
her womb; his life by nature proceed∣ed
from her, and she her self most unna∣turally
did feed upon him, he was her
<PB N="177" REF="97"/>
flesh, her bloud, her bones, and there∣fore
she eating him her self, her self
made food: No woe can equal her mi∣sery,
no grief can match her sad cala∣mities,
the Souldiers they smelt the
meat, upon which they straitly assem∣bled,
which when they saw, they trem∣bled,
and with staring hairs, and ghast∣ly
looks were thereat so affrighted and
amazed, that thereupon they presently
left the house: This horrid action did
more with them, then any force of man
could ever do, for this sad sight over
came them.</P>
<P>Oh then thou that dost live like a
fatted Brawn, and cramst thy guts as
long as thou canst; thou that dost eat
and drink away thy time, accounting it
no crime for gluttony to be thy God,
thou that must have fowl of all sorts,
and hast the bowels of the Ocean search∣ed
to satisfie thy appetite, and hast thy
dainties from all parts and places, near
and remote, and all to satisfie thy de∣vouring
throat, whose pamper'd paunch
<PB N="178" REF="98"/>
never leaves to feed and quaff. Think
on <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> perhaps it will move
thee in the midst of thy Diet and rio∣tous
courses, to a more temperate and
sober demeanor.</P>
<P>And you brave Dames, adorned
with Jems and Jewels, that must have
Grewels and Caudles, Conserves and
Marchpanes, &amp; that too in sundry shapes
made, as Castles, Towers, Horses, Apes,
and Bears; think on <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the
midst of all your glory, and then you
will be more sorrowful and less dainty;
poor <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had once Beauty,
Strength, Riches, spacious Buildings,
Authority and honour, yet these avail∣ed
them nothing, wrong trode down
right, and Justice was quite forgotten,
which was their chiefest, their greatest,
their only earthly good.</P>
<P>But now one little piece of bread
they reckoned more upon, then ever
before they did of bags of Gold. Scraps,
parings, and fragments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which your
full sed Corps did usually fling away,
<PB N="179" REF="98"/>
with them had been a ransom for a
King, the loathsome garbage which our
dogs refuse, had been amongst the <HI>Jews</HI>
a dish of state.</P>
<P>Whilst within Famine plaid the Ty∣rant,
the <HI>Romans</HI> Army strived to win
the Walls, their Pioners, and all their
Engines were at work to batter and as∣sault
the Wall: Now note, <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
had three strong stone Walls, and long
it was ere the <HI>Romans</HI> could get one, but
the dearth so spread, and death of the
sword, as that in the streets the living
trod upon the dead, the Carkasses which
the Seditious kill'd, fill'd many great
houses, so that with the stinck of bodies
putrefied there dyed a number number∣less
of people, for burial they afforded
none, but where they fell they let them
lye stink and rot, yet very unsensible
were they of the sad condition of each
other, by hundreds and thousands: then
did the souldiers throw their liveless
Corpses over the Walls, upon this and
their dis-uniting, the <HI>Romans</HI> had high
<PB N="180" REF="99"/>
advantages, and could with more securi∣ty
batter and scale the Walls.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Romans</HI> saw their dismal
fall from the Walls, they told it to <HI>Ti∣tus▪</HI>
which when he perceived he wept,
and lifted up his hands to Heaven and
called on God to witness with him this.</P>
<P>These flanghters saith he, were no
thoughts of mine, neither was it my
fault. Indeed those wretches that e∣scaped
from out of the City, and came
amongst their foes in my Army, found
both relief and pity, if any of those that
fled to my Army had by the Seditious
been caught, they had without remorse
strook them dead.</P>
<P>But another misery I must unfold un∣to
you, many <HI>Jews</HI> had swallowed store
of Gold, which they supposed in their
need should help them, but from
this treasure did their bane proceed, the
Gold was the cause that many of them
perisht, amongst them all, one unhappy
poor creature went privately to do the
needs of Nature, and in his dung he
<PB N="181" REF="99"/>
looked for his Gold, where being by the
straggling souldiers took, they ript him
up and searched his Maw, to find what
Gold or treasure there remained: In this
sort was many a Man and Woman ript
and slain for the gain of Gold that the
souldiers gaped for. In some they
found Gold, in many none, but had they
Gold or not, it was all one with them,
they were unbowelled and searched
most barbarously whither they had any
or no.</P>
<P>But my story briefly to conclude, <HI>Ve∣spasians</HI>
Souldiers had subdued the walls,
&amp; his triumphant banner was displayed,
and that in the midst of the streets, at
which the <HI>Jews</HI> were all dismayed, and
upon which they desperately did retire
to the Temple, which with ungodly
hands they set on fire; which noble <HI>Ti∣tus</HI>
with great care intreated them
they would spare: Oh save the
house (quoth he) and I will spare you
for the Temple sake, quench the fire,
<PB N="182" REF="100"/>
put out the flame! Oh let not after∣times
report that you have burnt the
worlds unmatchable glory! For your
own sakes, your wives, and your chil∣drens,
if from <HI>Vespasians</HI> hands you ex∣pect
grace, if from <HI>Vespasians</HI> hands you
expect your lives; oh save your Temple,
<HI>Titus</HI> doth command you to save the
Temple.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> heard of the mercy they
might have had, but with hearts hard
they refused the offer, they refused mer∣cy,
and themselves regarded not; but in
their madness they burned, consumed
and confounded to the ground King
<HI>Solomons</HI> great Temple, that Temple
which did cost thirty Millions, was in a
moment lost and consumed. The blest
<HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> the holiest place of∣ten
blessed with <HI>Johovahs</HI> sacred grace,
where as the Text saith, were 22000 Ox∣en
slain, and 12000 sheep besides, dyed
at the same time for an oblation.
That house of God whose glorious fame
<PB N="183" REF="100"/>
made all the World to wonder, was
burnt, and ransackt, and laid level to the
ground, which when it was seen by <HI>Ve∣spasian</HI>
and young <HI>Titus,</HI> they cry'd kill,
kill those wretched <HI>Jews,</HI> spare not to
kill, use speedy and Marshal Law; the
<HI>Roman</HI> souldiers then fell on and spared
none, they slew while they were weary
of slaying, and had no respect to Age or
Sex, the streets were drowned in bloud,
and slaughtered-Carkases did swim in
in bloud, the ablest men that were saved
they carryed away for slaves, <HI>John, Si∣mon,</HI>
and <HI>Eleazer,</HI> as they deserved were
brought to violent ends.</P>
<P>Now from that time that the <HI>Romans</HI> began
their siege, until the City was won by Sedition,
by the Sword, Fire, and Famine, were depri∣ved
of their lives eleven hundred thousand, be∣sides
one hundred thousand were taken as
beasts and sold for slaves, and from the time it
was first erected, till the <HI>Romans</HI> had take<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it,
it stood as appears in Histories twenty one
hundred seventy and nine years.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="101"/>
But before Gods vengeance was showred
down upon them, what strange prodigious
Wonders did he shew, as warnings how they
should avoid their destruction, and cause them
to repent the wicked evils they had done.</P>
<P>1. The Firmament shewed them a Comet
like a fiery Sword.</P>
<P>2. Divers nights the Temple and the Altar
were environed with bright burning lights.</P>
<P>3. In the midst of the Temple though un∣a
Cow did bear a Lamb.</P>
<P>4. No Bolts or Bars could restrain the
Temple-gates, but they would fly open of
themselves.</P>
<P>5. In the Air assembled Armed men and
Chariots, the pondrous Earth quaked, affright∣ed
and trembled.</P>
<P>6. To this sense a voice cryed in the Temple,
&amp; the people cry'd oh let us from hence depart!</P>
<P>These supernatural accidents, foretold some
fearful Judgment was to come, but toyes they
were accounted to the <HI>Jews,</HI> or scar-crow-bug∣bears
to fright children with, and not minding
them, nor no way by them being affrighted,
they did in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> securely revell, they
thought these signs were against their foes, and
not them.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="101"/>
But when war, when death, when spoil, when
ruine had storm'd them, appear'd the place so
desolate as none could have known there had
been a City.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Juda,</HI> and thus <HI>Jerusalem</HI> fell, which
Christ did foretell, and was now fulfill'd, that all
their joys they should be bereft off, and that
one stone should not be left to stand upon ano∣ther.</P>
