<HEAD><HI>A short Abstract of a</HI> Case <HI>which was last Sessions present∣ed to the Parliament: Being a true Relation of the Rise and Pro∣gress of the</HI> East-India <HI>Company,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Case is since Reprint∣ed, and Sold by <HI>A. Baldwin</HI> in <HI>Warwick-Lane, London.</HI></NOTE> <HI>shewing how their</HI> Manufactures <HI>have been, are, and will be prejudicial to the</HI> Manufactures <HI>of</HI> England, <HI>and what endeavours have been used for and against any Restrictions. Together with some</HI> Remarks <HI>and</HI> Query's <HI>thereon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THat for several Years after the <HI>East-India</HI> Company was Establish'd, they were afraid to bring in Manufactur'd Goods, which they knew were very prejudicial to our own: But now, by their great Stock and Interest, they are got over these Fears, and bring in vast quantities, opposing all kind of Restraint, tho they are convinc'd, and have declared their Manufactures are prejudicial to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>That as their Manufactures increas'd, our own were discouraged, and <HI>Wooll</HI> reduced so low, that an <HI>Act</HI> was made for <HI>Burying in Woollen,</HI> and the Manufacturers at the same time reduced to great Necessities, and many ruined thereby.</P>
<P>That during great part of the late War, the <HI>East India</HI> Trade was under some Discou∣ragement, and while it was so, our <HI>English</HI> Manufactures flourished very much, and exten∣ded to several Places, where, before the People were out of Employment, <HI>Wooll advanced,</HI> and bore a good Price, and all other Provisions raised proportionably.</P>
<P>That the <HI>English Manufacturers</HI> finding the <HI>East-India</HI> Traders endeavouring to get an Establishment by <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament, and knowing how fatal it might prove to their Ma∣nufactures, unless they were in some measure restrain'd, made their Application to the Parliament, and in Two succeeding Sessions a Restraining Bill was past in their Favour in the House of Commons, and a Third being drawn up in a different Method to the Two former, was stopt thereupon.</P>
<P>That the Proposal of advancing <HI>Two Millions</HI> for the Supply of the Government, was the great Inducement for the Establishment of the <HI>New Company;</HI> And the Reasons the Manufacturers did not then so vigorously complain and sollicite against the Establishment, as formerly they had done, proceeded from the Fair Promises given by the <HI>New East-India Men,</HI> and the Hope of a more favourable Opportunity; being unwilling to disturb the Loan, so necessary then to be raised.</P>
<P>That the Manufacturers being deceived by these <HI>East India</HI> Traders Fair Promises, and finding that the late great Importation and Wear of their <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures are increas∣ing, and have already, in a great measure, ruin'd the <HI>Canterbury</HI> Trade, and obliged the <HI>London</HI> Weavers to fall upon all sorts of Woollen Manufactures, to the Prejudice (and may in a short time prove to the utter Ruine) of several Places where such Manufactures have for a long time been <HI>established,</HI> are therefore come again to represent their <HI>Deplorable Case,</HI> and Pray the Consideration of this <HI>Parliament,</HI> and hope they will be pleased to con∣sider it as well as either the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New East-India</HI> Companies Cases.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>Since the Presenting the <HI>Case</HI> above mentioned, There has been from the 20th of <HI>May</HI> 1699,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This appears by a Printed List, which is Sold by</HI> Edw. Loyd <HI>at his</HI> Coffee-House <HI>in</HI> Lum∣bard-street.</NOTE> to the 4th of <HI>September</HI> 1699, arrived in <HI>England</HI> from the <HI>East-Indies</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> Ten Ships, which have brought in above Five Hundred Thousand Pieces of Manufactured Goods, which are by very intelligent Persons computed to be worth about One <HI>Million</HI> of Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> which vast quantity has already reduced the <HI>Manufactures</HI> of this King∣dom (to which they are opposite) to a very low Price, which has in a great measure rui∣ned the <HI>Manufactures</HI> in <HI>London, Norwich,</HI> and in divers other Places, as is ready more fully to be made appear.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> there is now gone to the <HI>East Indies</HI> and <HI>China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Loyd<HI>'s List. Two Millions sent to</HI> India.</NOTE> Fifty Ships, which are computed at near 400 Tuns <HI>per</HI> Ship, one with the other, and by a modest Computation are reckon∣ed to have carried with them near <HI>Two Millions</HI> of Bullion, which is about Forty Thou∣sand Pounds <HI>per</HI> Ship.</P>
<P>That all these Ships,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five Millions of Manufa∣ctures to be brought in two Year, and an Half.</NOTE> or as great a number, are expected to make a Return in Two Years and an half, and their Cargo may reasonably be supposed and valued (when they return) at <HI>Six Million,</HI> it being common to make about Treble the First Cost. And it is reasonable to suppose that Five Parts will be in Manufactures. And how far this may further dammage and ruine the Trade of this Kingdom, is submitted to consideration.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Two Queries.</HEAD>
<P>If the increase of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> was judged Prejudicial,
<MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="Query"/> and would <HI>inevitably</HI> sink the value of the <HI>Lands</HI> in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ruin</HI> our Trade; because the <HI>Irish</HI> could under-work, and so under-sell us, as the <HI>Act</HI> for restraining that Trade sets forth. Will not the <HI>East-India Manufactures</HI> do the same, and deserve the Considera∣tion of the Parliament,
<MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Query"/> as well as the <HI>Irish?</HI></P>
<P>Whether the great Complaints made in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide. The Es∣say upon the</HI> probable Me∣thods of ma∣king a People Gainers by Trade, <HI>p.</HI> 128.</NOTE> and other Foreign Parts of the decay of their Linnen Manufactures; and their setting up Woollen Manufactures do not (as the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Essay on Ways and Means</HI> tell us) proceed from the expence of <HI>East-In∣dia</HI> Linnens, which are here worn in their stead; and whether their late Prohibition of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> do not proceed more from that Cause, than from the late <HI>Act</HI> made for the more effectual restraining the Importation of <HI>Flanders</HI> Lace??</P>
