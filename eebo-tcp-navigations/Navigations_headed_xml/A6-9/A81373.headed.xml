<HEAD>A PERFECT DIURNALL of all such Passages as have happened in the English Fleet on the narrow Seas, since the departure of the Lord Admirall: <HI>From the</HI> 17. <HI>of October to the</HI> 13. <HI>of November.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>October</HI> 17. <SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N this day about 10. of the clock the Lord Admirall with a number of Captains and Gentlemen landed at <HI>Dover,</HI> at whose landing there was a great triumph in token of our love to his renowned actions, our Fleet of Ships being a∣bout 32. discharged three times on all sides, so that there were neere 200. Peeces of Ordnance dischar∣ged at that time, with many expressions of joy and hearty wishes for our Admirals good successe upon the land; at whose departure all Masters and Mari∣ners much lamented, though they had Malago Sack of the best to cherish their comfortlesse hearts, that afterward there was health upon health drunk that day in abundance, as also to the Vice-Admirall Ca∣ptaine <HI>Battie,</HI> who hath the whole charge of the Navy in the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> absence.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 18. We weighed our anchors, and the greater Ships bore for the Kings Channell, where they anchored that night, and some of the lesser Ships kept their course through the Channell next
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>the <HI>Downes,</HI> by 8. of the clock in the evening they were welcomed by the Reare Admirall, and the S. <HI>George,</HI> which were newly come into the <HI>Downes</HI> from <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> but our Vice-Admirall with the rest of the great ships came not untill the next day at noon, at whose arrivall we met with three French Men of Warre which refused to do their obeysance to His Majesties ships, wherupon our Admirall gave them a broad side, who straightway struck their top sailes.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 19. Our Vice-Admirall came ashore at S. <HI>Margarets</HI> with divers Captaines, where he was welcomed by the expression of divers peeces of ordnance shot from severall places.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 20. We rode still at anchor, the Vice-Ad∣mirall neither visiting any of the ships, nor going a∣shore, but placed and displaced certain Captaines, whose names for the present I forbeare to speak of, till the next opportunity.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 21. We had a muster, and rode still in the <HI>Downes,</HI> the Whelps being imployed unto <HI>Holland,</HI> and weighed anchor with a Westerly wind; about 5. of the clock in the evening the Antilope came in∣to our Fleet, who had been at the <HI>Brill,</HI> and bronght us newes that there were 17. saile of Flemmish Hoyes as then going to the <HI>Brill</HI> with French soul∣diers: another ship being full of French Comman∣ders, would not strike saile unto His Majesties ships, upon which Captaine <HI>Fox</HI> discharged two or three peeces of Ordnance upon them, and then, and not before, he struck the top-saile down upon the cape.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P> <HI>Octob.</HI> 22. We lay still at anchor, and the Vice-Ad∣mirall going ashore was again welcomed as before.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 23. We were divided into Squadrons of 3. and to each Squadron were annexed 5. Merchants ships, and so by consent were disperst about severall places.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 24. The Leopard and the Samson with two Whelpes weighed anchor very early in the morn∣ing, and coasted about <HI>Callis</HI> Road, and came in to the rest of the Fleet on the <HI>Downes</HI> that evening.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 25. The Lyon, the Freeman, with two Whelps, weighed anchor and left the Fleet, the Whelps came in the next day about noone, and the other two about night; at whose returne wee had newes of a fight betwixt a Hollander and 2. Dun∣kerks Slopes on our seas neer <HI>Dover</HI> road, the Hol∣lander, having 10. peeces of ordnance, was taken by the Slopes, his men all hurt but 4. and the Gunner kild; but an English ship, called the Blessing, rescued him, and gave the Hollander his ship againe.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 26. About twelve of the clock we met the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Man of Warre, chasing of a Merchants ship of <HI>London,</HI> which came from the East Indies, but she was constrained to put in for <HI>Ireland,</HI> where this Man of War had fetcht her out: he saluted our Vice-Admirall with many pee∣ces of ordnance, which were answered againe with the like: at the last we boarded her, and took ther∣in armour for 5000. men going to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which we made stay of, and intend to send her with a safe convoy to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P> <HI>Octob.</HI> 27, 28, 29. We lay at anchor, wanting pro∣vision of bisket, but we were supplied in <HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 30. The wind being calm at W. and by S. we weighed anchor, and sailed to and fro, praying for a faire gale of wind to course the sea; for our Vice-Admirall had notice given him of 14. Flemins and 14. French which kept nigh <HI>Portland,</HI> but since we heard they were parted, neverthelesse we dis∣charged a peece of ordnance, and put out a red flag in the Meson shroud: immediately the Captaines and Masters of every ship made their repair aboard, where we called a Councell of Warre, in which it was ordered, that if in case we met with the Hol∣landers and French Fleet together, and that the French would not do their obeysance, to send to the Hollanders to tell them, we did not think they would any wayes come against the King and Par∣liament, so according to their answers to deale with them, who sent us a faire answer, that they never had any intent to come against the King or Parlia∣ment, the King being their only Protector.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 1. We came to <HI>Dannase,</HI> which is the Ea∣sterly part of the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> and about 11. a clock we came to anchor 2. or 3. leagues from the Isle, where we lay till 4. of the clock the next morning.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 2. We came to <HI>S. Ellen</HI> near the <HI>Iste of Wight,</HI> where we rode untill the 5. of this moneth, and weighing anchor we descried 40. and odd saile, whom we thought to be the Dutch and French Fleet; but when we came up to them, we found them to be Flemmish Merchants which came out of <HI>France</HI> with salt, except some 3. or 4. men of warre:
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>we spake with some of them, and after some small view of them, we parted.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 5. We came into <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, all the way not past any thing of note, save that we seized on two Dunkerks laden with Ammunition for <HI>Ire∣land:</HI> but since our coming here, and before, we heard that the Flemins have sworn never to lift up their hands against the King or Parliament of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and that they are not in company with the French, who have been about our coasts, but are now gone; we onely stay for a faire wind to carie us to the Lands end, and as farre as <HI>Silly,</HI> and so I think we shall return hither againe, whence what may passe hereafter of more consequence I shall be glad to advise you, and should joy to see some sport if any durst meet us; but I feare that labour will be saved; but we shall not rest till we have met with the King of <HI>France</HI> his Army, which is about 10000 souldiers, but we shall narrowly watch their land∣ing upon any of onr coasts.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 6. We weighed anchor out of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, and came neare the <HI>Isle of Silly,</HI> and on the same day we came into the Sound again, where we found one of the King of <HI>France</HI> his Dragons, be∣ing such a ship as one of His Majesties Whelps, ha∣ving with her two small Barks, the one he had re∣lieved out of the hands of Dunkerks; the Captaine of the ship went aboard our Admirall, but stayed not long, but was discharged, he told our Vice-Ad∣mirall that 12. saile of Dutch, and 14. sail of French which lay about our coast, waiting for purchase.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 7. We coasted up and down, and within shot of <HI>Poole</HI> there were three French Barks laid at
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>anchor driven in through tempestuous weather, our ships were too great a burden to follow them, but we sent our shallops well man'd to board them, and there was found therein 1000. mens armour, going for <HI>Ireland,</HI> all which we seized on, and have stayed the Barks till further order of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 8. Within 3. leagues of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> we sei∣zed on a Flemish ship who had landed divers com∣manders, as by the examination of the Master of the ship it appeared, that they were sent into <HI>Cornwall</HI> with Letters from Colonell <HI>Goring</HI> to Sir <HI>Ralph Ho∣pton,</HI> the ship wee gave in charge to the Maior of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> the Captain and soldiers sent to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Novem.</HI> 9, 10. We spied a Fleet of Dunkerks com∣ing from the Southward, suspecting Colonel <HI>Goring</HI> and others to be therein, but the swiftnesse of their small vessels out-sailed our Fleet.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 11. We took the Dutch man of war that landed Prince <HI>Robert</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who was laden with store of ammunition, and going for <HI>Lyme</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> we have distrained both ship and ammu∣nition till the Prince shall reprieve them.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 12. Wee had order to come for <HI>Ports∣mouth,</HI> and what further order as yet I know not, but we hope we shall make a good voyage, and take all the scouts roving up and downe our coasts; for we have laid diligent wait in all creeks, to stop the passage of the Cavaliers from coming out or going in, in the <HI>interim</HI> if any thing passe, you shall heare from me, but believe no report contrary to this journall, which is the truth of our proceedings.</P>
