<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have given Order to Col. <HI>Dean</HI> and some others, to seize the Treasuries in Goldsmiths-Hall and Wea∣vers-Hall, that by the said Moneys I may be inabled to pay quarters whilest we lie hereabouts; having also Ordered Receipts and Assurance to be given to the Trea∣surers of the said moneys, that they should be fully reim∣burst for the said sums out of the Assessements of the Ci∣ty due to the Army, and out of other Assessements there∣unto belonging; and indeed, although I am unwilling to take these strict courses, yet having sent so often to you for the said Arreares, and desired sums of money to be advanced by you, far short of the sums due from you, yet I have been delayed and denyed, to the hazard of the Army, and the prejudice of others in the Suburbs upon whom they are quartered; whereof I thought fit to send some Forces into the City to quarter there, untill I may be satisfied the Arreares due unto the Army: and if this seem strange onto you, 'tis no lesse then that our Forces have been Ordered to do by the Parliament, in the seve∣rall Counties of the Kingdome where Assessement have not been paid, and there to continue untill they have been paid: And here give me leave to tell you, the Counties of the Kingdome have born Free-quarter, and that in a great measure, for want of your paying your Arreares e∣qually with them; wherefore these waies, if they dislike you, yet they are meerly long of your selves, and are of as great regret to me and to the Army, as to your selves, we wishing not onely the good and prosperity of your
<PB REF="3"/> City, but that things may be so carried towards you, as may give you no cause of jealousie: I thought fit to let you know, That if you shall take a speedy course to sup∣ply us with 40000. l. forthwith, according to my former desire, and provide speedily what also is in Arrear, I shall not onely cause the moneys in the Treasuries to be not made use of, but leave them to be disposed of as of right they might, and also cause my Forces to be withdrawn from being in any sort troublesome or chargeable to the City; And let the world (judge whether this be not just and equall dealing with you. I rest, My Lord,</P>

<P>Saturday the 9. of this instant December, Colonell <HI>Deanes</HI> Regiment of foot, and some Troopes of horse marched within the Walls of the City of London, brought 4. Drakes within Ludgate, and placed them in Blackfryers, put some Companies in <HI>Martins Ludgate</HI> Church, and others in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church; a party of Colo∣nell <HI>Hewsons</HI> Regiment, and others went to Weavers-Hall (in Bassingshaw street, where upon search they found a∣bout thirty thousand pounds, which (according to Or∣ders) the souldiers carryed in 5. Carts to <HI>White-hall;</HI> It was at the time of the seizure alleadged by some which stood by, that all, or at least part thereof was Orphans money, to which it was replyed, that if it appeared to be so, it should be returned without losse: <HI>But what should Orphans money doe in Coffers out of Guild-Hall, is the Cham∣ber of London not large enough to hold it?</HI> this was money which was raised above 6. Moneths since for supplying such as formerly lent out of zeale to the cause, and con∣fidence of the publique faith such Sums as they could then spare, hoping to have it againe in a short space, and for that they might appeare on record not to be Malig∣nants of that time; and what through want of that they then parted with, the losse of trade, and paying of taxati∣ons with other men, they became necessitous, and unable to maintain their own Families; which miseries of theirs being made known after long &amp; tedious attendance, some course at last was taken to pay those off whose debt was not above ten pounds, of which this money was part, and as yet undestributed to those which dearly wanted the same, but knew not where to find it, so that by this discovery the parties to whom this money was due, (and could not receive it) will not only in a very short time enjoy that which is their due, but the other designe
<PB REF="5"/> for which that was kept, so much weakned, if not whol∣ly prevented.</P>
<P>A Common Councell was called and this 9. day of Decemb. held in Guild-Hall, at which there was a large debate about his Excellencies Letter to the Lord Mayor before recited, and the Warrants for furnishing the soul∣diers with bedding: a Letter was last agreed upon to be sent back again to the Lord Generall, acquainting his Excellencie, that they have made choise of a Committee to satisfie his Lordship and such Officers as he shall ap∣point concerning the money was taken out of Weavers-Hall, and to declare their willingnesse to obey the War∣rant for accommodating the souldiers with necessaries and bedding.</P>
