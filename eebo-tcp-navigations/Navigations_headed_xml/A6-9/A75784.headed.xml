The Evidence for the King Swore, That Boatswain <HI>Clamp</HI> receiving some Stores a shore, instad of bringing them on Board the <HI>York,</HI> put them on Board a <HI>Ketch,</HI> and sent his Mate a shore a day or two following to receive Money for them, which Money the Evidence Swore they saw them telling over in the Mates Cabin: The Boatswain and his Mate both denied the Fact, and said they were brought on Board, and alledg'd that the Evidence had Threatned to be Reveng'd of them, because they had beat them for their Laziness on Board, however this Insinuation did not prevail, for the Unanimous Vote of the Board declar'd them both Guilty; upon which they were confin'd to the Boatswain's Cabin of the <HI>Carlisle,</HI> where they be∣wail'd their Misfortune with great
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>Penitence, continuing to assert their Innocence, particularly the Mate, owning they had been Tardy sermerly.</P>
<P>Every day of the last Week, the Chaplain of the St. <HI>Michael</HI> came on Board to Visit them, and Instruct them to prepare for a better World. On <HI>Thursday</HI> last he told them they must despair of a Pardon, and direct their Petiti∣ons to Almighty God, and beg Pardon for their Sins, by making an open Confession of them; the Boatswain told him, he had been a great Sinner, and had two Wives Living, One at <HI>Chatham,</HI> and another at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> that he deserv'd Death, but denied the present Fact. The Mate for∣gave the Evidence very heartily, and thanked them for the kindness they had done him, hoping by their wrong Accusation, he might enjoy Heaven, and seem'd very well pleased at his Change. On <HI>Sunday</HI> the <HI>19th.</HI> they receiv'd the Sacrament, and within two hours after were carried on Board the St. <HI>Michael,</HI> Guarded by the Pro∣vest Marshal, Corporal, and Mus∣quetiers. This morning a Coun∣cil of War was call'd on Board the St. <HI>Michael,</HI> (where the Flag now is) and about Eleven a Clock they were both Hang'd, the Boat∣swain at the <HI>Starboard fore Yard-Arm,</HI> and his Mate at the <HI>Larboard fore Yard-Arm.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Valune</HI> a <HI>Switzer,</HI> had been in the Service ever since the War, formerly a Soldier in <HI>France,</HI> and Barber Chyrurgion by Pro∣fession; one Night on Board the <HI>Berwick,</HI> he and one <HI>William Pike</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> man being both drunk, they could not agree about a peice of Candle, and falling out; they fell to Blows, upon which <HI>Vallune</HI> gave him a Cut from his Far to the end of his Mouth with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Knife, upon which he was secur'd, and <HI>Pike</HI> taken into Cure and set a shore, where he dyed in a Fort∣nights time of that Wound, as the Doctor Swore; he was likewise Tryed by the foregoing Honour∣able Board on the same day as the Boatswain, and having nothing to say for himself, he was found Guilty of wilful Murther; From which time, till he was Executed, he Repented very heartily of Sins, That he had been guilty of Who∣ring and Drinking, and Irreligi∣ous Life, and hoped that God would have Mercy on his poor Soul. He was Hang'd this mor∣ning with the Boatswain and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mate, at the <HI>Starboard main Yard-Arm.</HI></P>
