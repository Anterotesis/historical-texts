<P>However, Sir, as they are (since the Assembly hath approv'd them, and Ordered them to be put in Print) I thought it my duty to Dedicate them to your Patronage, who, of the most and best of them, was the only Author.</P>
<P>Little addition there is to what your self had done in the time of your Government, only what vitious Excrescencies had grown in the body of them, by the corrupt humor of the times, we have throughly purg'd them of, that we might not any where leave unrazed the memory of our enforc'd Defection from his Sacred Majesty; for whom, your prudent care so long preserved the Countrey, both from the ruine we were almost brought to by that desperate Warr with <HI>Opechankevogh,</HI> whose Conquest (had not the Cloudiness of those times obscured the glory of it) could not have lost the esteem of being one of the most important Services, that, perhaps, had been rendred in many years before to the Crown.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>But, Sir, you have not only done this, but also retein'd us in an inviolated obedience to his Majesty, that we were the last of his Subjects that necessity enforc'd from our duty, which was an Act of approved Loyalty, as the other was of gallant Bravery.</P>
<P>Sir, though the remoteness of this place, hath veild the glory of these, and other your Honourable Actions; yet I, and all that here with me were witnesses of them, must, and ever will, acknowledg that to you, next to his Majesties goodness, we owe both the Laws we Govern by, and the Countrey it self now Govern'd by those Laws: which truth, as a Publique Person, I must ever justifie; and, as a Particular one, confess my self by it oblig'd to be</P>

<HEAD>PREAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEREAS the late unhappy Distractions caused frequent Change in the Government of this Countrey, and those produced so many Alterations in the Laws, that the People knew not well what to obey, nor the Judges what to punish; by which means, Injustice was hardly to be avoided, and the just freedom of the peo∣ple, by the uncertainty and licentiousness of the Laws, hardly to be preserved: This Assembly taking the same in∣to their serious Considerations, and gravely weighing the Obligati∣ons they are to discharge to God, the King, and the Countrey; have, by setling the Laws, diligently endeavoured to prevent the like inconveniences, by causing the whole body of the Laws to be Reviewed; all unnecessary Acts, and chiefly such as might keep in memory our forced Deviation from his Majesties Obedience, to be Repealed and Expunged; and those that are in force to be brought into one Volume: and, lest any prejudice might arise by the ignorance of the times from whence those Acts were in force, they have added the Dates of every Act, to the end that Courts might rightly administer Justice, and give sentence according to Law, for any
<PB N="2" REF="4"/> thing hapning at any time since any Law was in force; and have also endeavoured in all things, as near as the capacity and con∣stitution of this Countrey would admit, to adhere to those Excellent, and often refined Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to which we profess and ac∣knowledge all Reverence and Obedience; and that the Laws, made by us, are intended by us but as brief Memorials of that, which the capacity of our Courts is utterly unable to Collect out of its vast Volumns, though sometimes perhaps, for the difference of our and their Condition, varying in small things, but far from the presum∣ption of contradicting any thing therein contained. And, because it is impossible to honour the King as we should, unless we serve and fear God as we ought; and that they might shew their equal care, they have set down certain Rules to be observed in the Government of the Church, untill God shall please to turn his Majesties pious thoughts towards us, and provide a better supply of Ministers among us.</P>
<P><HI>Be it therefore Enacted by the Governour, Council, and Burgesses of this Grand Assembly,</HI> That all the following Laws, continued or made by this Assembly, shall be hereafter reputed the Laws of this Countrey, by which all Courts of Judicature are to proceed in giving of Sentence, and to which all persons are strictly required to yield all due Obedience; and that all other Acts, not in this Collection mentioned, be to all intents and purposes utterly Abroga∣ted and Repealed, unless Suit be Commenced for any thing done in the time when a Law, now repealed, was in force; in which case, the producing that Law shall excuse any person for doing any thing according to the Tenor thereof.</P>

<HEAD><HI>XIV.</HI> Burial of Servants, or others, privately; Prohibited.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas the private Burial of Servants, and others, give occa∣sion of much Scandal against divers persons, and sometimes not undeservedly of being guilty of their Deaths; from which, if the persons suspected be innocent, there can be no Vindication; nor if guilty, no punishment, by reason they are, for the most part, Bu∣ried without the knowledg or view of any others then such of the Family, as by nearness of relation, as being Husband, Wife, or Child are unwilling, or as Servants are fearful, to make discovery, if Murther were committed; for Remedy whereof, as also for ta∣king away that Barbarous Custom, of exposing the Corps of the Dead (by making their Graves in common and unfenced places) to the prey of Hoggs, and other Vermine: Be it Enacted, That there be in every Parish, three, or four, or more, places appointed, according to the greatness or littleness of the same, to be set a-part and fenced in, for places of publique Burial, for that Precinct;
<PB N="8" REF="7"/> and further, that before the Corps be Buried, there be, at least, three or four of the Neighbours called: who may, in case of suspition, view the Corps; and, if none, yet, according to the decent Custom of all <HI>Christendom,</HI> they may accompany it to the grave.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>XVI.</HI> Registers to be kept by the Ministers or Readers.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas many differences do frequently arise about the age of Orphants, and enquiries are often made for persons Impor∣ted into this Countrey, and here deceased, and no positive Certifi∣cates can be granted of the Age of one, or Death of the other, by reason no Registers have been kept, which might, by the Record there entred, evidence the same: Be it therefore Enacted, That the Minister or Reader of every Parish, shall well, truly, and plainly, Record all Births, Burials, or Marriages, that shall happen within the Precincts of that Parish, in a Book to be provided by the Vestry for that purpose. And, if any Master of a Family, or other person con∣cerned, shall omit the giving notice to the said Minister or Reader,
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> of the day of the Birth, Death, or Marriage, of any to him or them re∣lated, the space of a Moneth, such person for such his neglect, be fined One hundred pounds of Tobacco: And that the Minister have for their entry of such Birth, Death, or Marriage, Three pounds of Tobacco; and if they neglect entring the same, as aforesaid, that they be fi∣ned, upon discovery made of the said neglect, five hundred pounds of Tobacco to the use of the Parish.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>XVII.</HI> Licences for Marriage how to issue.</HEAD>
<P>AND whereas many times Licences are granted, and the persons are Marryed out of the Parishes, which Licences have been usu∣ally granted by the Governour, whose knowledg of persons cannot possibly extend over the whole Country: Be it Enacted, That hence∣forward, all persons desiring Licences for Marriage, shall first re∣pair to the Clerk of the County-Court, and there give Bond, with good Security, that there is no lawful cause to obstruct their said Marriage; and that upon receipt of such Bond, the said Clerk shall write the Licence, and certifie to the first in Commission for that County, or such other whom it shall please the Governour to Depute, that he hath taken a Bond, as aforesaid; who, by vertue thereof, shall signe the said Licence, and direct the same to the Mi∣nister.

<HEAD><HI>XVIII.</HI> Provision for a Colledge.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas the want of able and faithful Ministers in this Coun∣trey, deprives us of those great blessings and mercies, that al∣wayes attend upon the Service of God, which want by reason of our great distance from our Native Countrey, cannot in probability be alwayes supplyed from hence: Be it enacted, That for the advance of Learning, Education of Youth, Supply of the Ministry, and Pro∣motion of Piety, there be Land taken up or purchased for a Colledge and Free School, and that there be with as much speed as may be convenient housing Erected thereon for entertainment of Students and Scholars.</P>
<P>Whereas an Antient practice of this Countrey, hath, contrary to Law and Reason, ignorantly vested the Lands of persons intestate in the hands of Administrators, of whom divers persons have pur∣chased, and hold their Lands by no other Titles, then such sales which can be of no validity against the claim of the King, whom no time can prescribe, and to whom, if an Heir appear not, the Land must of necessity devolve. And if the King should at any time, give express Order to an Escheater to make inquiry into the Titles we hold by; the said Escheater cannot, by vertue of his Office, but find all such Lands for the King, which we <HI>Francis Morison,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Ludwell,</HI> who are, at present, intrusted by his Majesties Treasurer to make com∣position for all Lands so Escheated to his Majesty, taking into our serious consideration, and out of our tender care of many poor men, who by the loss of Lands, thus perhaps dearly purchased, and ho∣nestly payd for; and out of our sense of the many inconveniences, and great damages would fall upon them by being ousted out of their Possessions by the severity of a too rigorous Escheator; and that, on the other side, we might not seem to debarr his Majesty of his just Rights: we have thought it convenient to propose a certain Rule for Compositions for all Lands held by any pretended Right two years, by which, while the power is in our hands, we shall proceed: and if the Assembly think it a favour, we shall joyn with them, making it our request to Major <HI>Norwood,</HI> his Majesties Treasurer, to get his Majesty to confine them, that no succeeding Escheator may at his pleasure rigorously exceed these our moderate and reasonable De∣mands.</P>
<P N="1">1. We concede, that any person, having been two years in pos∣session of any Land that ought to have been vested in his Majesty by Escheat, shall pay for his Composition but one Hundred Pounds

<P N="2">2. That every person having been so in possession two years as afore∣said, shall have Eight Months time to petition for, and make their Composition; but if they defer it longer, and another sue for it, and obtain it, they can impute the blame to nothing but their own neg∣lect.</P>

<P>That all Lands escheated before the two years aforesaid, the per∣son concerned shall pay for his Composition as aforesaid; but all Lands, which shall hereafter lapse, or which have lapsed within the two years last past, the Composition to be made for, with those by his Majesties Treasurer appointed and authorized thereunto; and that the Widdow be admitted in the first place, she making her claim within Eight Months according to the Proposition abovesaid.</P>

And be it further enacted, that, in ease the said Widdow or Child do administer, the Estate shall be inventoried, and apprizement made by four men appointed by the <HI>Court,</HI> and sworn by a Justice of that <HI>Court,</HI> as formerly; which Inventory and Apprizement shall by the said Widdow or Child, be brought into the next <HI>Court,</HI> held in that Coun∣ty; unless the <HI>Court</HI> for Reasons shewed them, may think fit to grant Liberty to bring it in the <HI>Court</HI> following.

<P>And whereas, It hath been the frequent evil practice of Admi∣nistrators, assoon as they have obtained an Order to Administer, to Act as Administrators by vertue of that Order, without giving secu∣rity, or taking out their Commissions, so that, the Estate being im∣bezelled away, no Accompt can be given thereof. Be it therefore Enacted, That who ever pretends to Administer upon any Estate, shall bring to the Court sufficient security before the Order shall be granted: and an Order thus obtained legally, by giving such security to be truly accomptable to bring in a true Inventory, and to perform such things as the Administrators by Law are enjoyned, shall not at any time after be reversed, unless the party that obtained the same dye before he hath given an Accompt of the Estate and obtained his <HI>Qui∣etus.</HI> In which case, the Court is impowred to grant the Administrati∣on of that Estate, so not accompted for to some other person, who may by vertue thereof call his Heirs, Executors, or Administrators of the former Administrators to Accompt, who shall pay out of the said deceased Admistrators Estate, all such debts as shall be found due to the Estate he Administred upon in the first place.</P>

<P>WHereas the prudence of all Nations hath provided for the defraying the Publique necessary charges of the Countrey, rather by laying an Imposition upon the Adventurers for the Staple-Commodities of the Country, by the Exportation of which the great advantage accrews, than by Taxing the persons of the Inha∣bitants; this present Grand Assembly endeavouring, as much as in them lies, to ease the burthen of the people, and taking into consideration, the great benefit, that accrews to other Countreys by the Customs a∣rising from our Commodity Tobacco; and that <HI>Virginia,</HI> whose parti∣lar Staple it is, hath from it, nor from the Adventurers hither, no Pub∣lique Advantage: We have thought it necessary and convenient, and accordingly have Enacted and confirmed, that all Masters, Mar∣chants of Ships and Marriners trading to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and not bound by Charter-Party to return and discharge in any of the <HI>English</HI> Domini∣ons in <HI>Europe,</HI> shall pay for every Hogshead of Tobacco, they shall load aboard any Ship, Barque, or other Vessel arriving here, after the first of <HI>August</HI> next, and not bound as aforesaid, ten shillings ster∣ling, either in Money, or good Bills of Exchange, with good caution, or in good valuable Commodities at Twenty five <HI>per cent.</HI> advance.

<HEAD><HI>CXXXII.</HI> Castle-Duties to be paid.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas the Castle-Duties granted by his Majesty to Colonel <HI>Francis Morrison,</HI> Captain of the Fort at <HI>Point-Comfort</HI> are rendred of no value by the charge of Boat and Hands going to Collect them, and the inconsiderableness of the Commodities they are paid in, being commonly the reffuse of their Cargoe; Be it therefore Enacted, That all Masters of Ships, and other Vessels, being thereunto required by the Officer ap∣pointed by the said Colonel <HI>Morison,</HI> shall give in a true bur∣then of their Ships, or Vessels: and the lists of their Passengers; at such convenient places, and to such persons as the said Co∣lonel <HI>Morrison,</HI> shall in each River appoint, upon Oath to be Administred by his said Collector or Officer, if a Commissioner; or else by any one or two Commissioners. And if any Master shall make false Entry either of his burthen or list of Passen∣gers, then he shall, upon proof thereof made, pay treble duties for the number of passengers or quantity of Tuns concealed, the same to be recovered out of the Estate of the Master so of∣fending. And the like penalty upon all such Masters as shall with∣out coming into harbour fetch away their loading in Sloops of Boats. And what Master soever shall not pay his Duties in kind, being half a pound of Powder, and three pounds of leaden shot, <HI>per</HI> Tun, and six pence <HI>per</HI> Poll for every person imported, not being a Marriner, that then he shall pay in lieu thereof one shil∣ling <HI>per</HI> Tun, and six pence <HI>per</HI> Poll either in Money or Goods, as they cost at the first penny.

<HEAD><HI>CXXXVI.</HI> Acts concerning the <HI>Indians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHereas the mutual Discontents, Complaints, Jealousies and Fears of English and <HI>Indians,</HI> proceed chiefly from the vio∣lent Intrusions of divers English made into their Lands, forcing the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> by way of Revenge, to kill the Cattel and Hogs of the English; and by that means Injuries being done on both sides, Reports and Ru∣mours are spread of the Hostile Intentions of each to others, tend∣ing infinitely to the disturbance of the Peace of His Majestie's Coun∣try: And whereas the Laws prohibiting the Purchase of any <HI>Indi∣an</HI>'s Lands (unless acknowledged at <HI>General Courts</HI> or Assemblies; by reason it is as easie to affright them to a publick, as well as a pri∣vate acknowledgement) are made fruitless, and ineffectuall; cor∣rupt Interpreters often adding to this mischief, by rendring them willing to surrender, when indeed, they intended to have received a Confirmation of their own Rights, and a Redress of their wrongs; which mischiefs had they continued, must needs have involved the Country into an inevitable and destructive Warr. For Remedy of which Inconveniences, and that, for the future, a sure equitable peace may be established, the Governour, Council, and Burgesses out of their tender care of Justice and the Peace of this His Majestie's Country, have enacted, ordained, and confirmed, and do by these Presents, enact, ordain, and confirm, That, for the future,</P>
<P>No <HI>Indian</HI> King, or Other, shall upon any pretence, ali∣en, or sell; nor no English, for any cause or consideration whatsoever, purchase or buy any Trace or Parcel of Land now justly claimed, or actually possessed, by any <HI>Indian</HI> or <HI>In∣dians</HI> whatsoever: All such bargains and sales hereafter made, or pretended to be made, being hereby declared to be invalid, void, and null; any Acknowledgement, Surrender, Law or Custom former∣ly used to the contrary notwithstanding. And further, That the <HI>In∣dian</HI>'s Properties in their Goods, be hereby assured and confirmed to them; and their Persons so secured, that, whoever shall defraud, or take from them their Goods, or do hurt or injury to their Per∣sons, shall make such satisfaction, and suffer such Punishments, as the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> or this Country, do inflict, if the same had been done to an English man.</P>
<P>And be it further enacted, That what Englishman hath already contrary to the Laws formerly in force, for surrendring and acknow∣ledging <HI>Indian</HI>'s Lands, made Incroachments, or seated upon them, shall, if they make not good proof of their Title, upon Complaint made, be, by Order directed to the Sheriff to execute, removed
<PB N="77" REF="44"/> from their Seats of Land thus wrongfully incroached; and all Houses by them built upon the said Lands, be demolished and burned.</P>
<P>And be it further enacted, That all English Men, having by sur∣renders made at <HI>Quarter-Courts</HI> or Assemblies, procured a colou∣rable Right to any Land by the said English now seated within three Miles of any <HI>Indians,</HI> for prevention of the Injuries done to the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> by the said Englishmens Hogs and Cattel, shall send such Number of hands, as they shall be appointed by Commissioners, to be authorized by the Governour, to help the <HI>Indians</HI> to fence in a Corn-field, proportionable to the Number of Persons, the said <HI>In∣dian</HI> Town doth consist of; and that after such fence once made suf∣ficiently, according to Act of the Assembly, if the <HI>Indians</HI> keep it not in repair, what damages soever they shall afterwards sustain, shall be at the hazard, and sole loss, of them the said <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>And be it further enacted, That for the better relief of the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> whom, the seating of the English, hath forced from their wonted Conveniencies of oystering, fishing, and gathering Tuchahoe, Cortenions, and other Wild-Fruits, by which they were wonted for a great part of the Year, to subsist: Be it therefore enacted, granted, and confirmed, That the said <HI>Indians,</HI> upon Address made to two of the Justices of that County, they desiring to oyster or gather Wild-Fruits in, as aforesaid, they the said Justices shall grant a Licence to the said <HI>Indians,</HI> to oyster, or gather Wild-Fruits, as aforesaid: Pro∣vided, the said Justices limit the time the <HI>Indians</HI> are to stay; and the <HI>Indians</HI> bring not with them any Guns, or Ammunitions, or other offensive Weapons, but only such Tools or Implements, as serve for the end of their coming. And if any Englishman shall presume to take from the <HI>Indians</HI> so coming in, any of their Goods, or shall kill, wound, or main any <HI>Indian,</HI> he shall suffer, as if he had done the same to an Englishman, and be fined for his Contempt.</P>
<P>And because many under-hand and unlicensed Traders do truck and Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> (contrary to the Act of Assembly, and to the great prejudice of all such, as legally procure Commissions from the Governour) under pretence, that the things trucked for, be given them by the <HI>Indians:</HI> Be it therefore enacted, That what Persons soever, shall, upon any pretence whatsoever, buy, take, or receive any thing or commodity from an <HI>Indian,</HI> shall, upon proof there∣of at any <HI>Court,</HI> be ordered to pay treble the value of the thing re∣ceived, to the Person injured thereby.</P>
<P>And because sometimes Differences may arise between the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> and those they trade with, which if we should proceed by way of Arrest, might tend much to the Disturbance of the peace of the Country: Be it therefore enacted, That any Commissionated Trader, having a difference with any <HI>Indian</HI> King, or Other, shall repair to to the Governour for him, or such other as he shall appoint, to de∣termine the matter in controversie between them.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="45"/>And because the Imprisonment of an <HI>Indian,</HI> may bring a War upon the Country; and consequently, the making of Peace and War, being wrested out of those hands, it is, by his Majestie's Com∣mission, intrusted into the power of every Individual in the Coun∣try: Be it therefore enacted, That no Person of what quality soever, presume to Imprison any <HI>Indian</HI> King, without a special Warant from the Governour, and two of the Council, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost peril.</P>
<P>And because this Act cannot be put in Execution without Com∣missioners, to view the present Bounds of the English and <HI>Indi∣ans:</HI> Be it therefore enacted, That the Honourable Governour be desired and authorized to appoint uninterested Persons, Com∣missioners, to go, with Parties of Horse, to the several <HI>Indian</HI>-Towns; and there to proclaim these and the following Articles of Peace between Us and the <HI>Indians;</HI> to settle the Bounds between us; and to appoint others of the most integrity, to fix the time, and as∣sess the work; to help the <HI>Indians</HI> Fence, and all other things by this Act enjoyned; and, for prevention of future Intrenchments beyond the bounds once fixed, Be it further enacted, That the Gover∣nour be desired and authorized to Commissionate certain Persons annually to visit the same, and to take care, that no Intrenchment be henceforth made upon the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>And because an Interval between the <HI>Indians</HI> cannot, in the pre∣sent nearness of seating, be so laid out, as may wholly secure the English from the <HI>Indians</HI> coming in, and pilfering things from them, if a free intercourse be admttied: Be it therefore enacted, for pre∣vention thereof, and to the end, that the Nations may be distinguish∣ed; and so, if they are taken in the manner of doing any Injuries, the sufferers know to what Kings to address themselves for remedy; That Badges (<HI>viz.</HI> Silver-Plates, and Copper-Plates, with the name of the Town graved upon them) be given to all adjacent Kings, with∣in our Protection. And that all the said Kings give it in Charge to their people, that none of them presume, upon what occasion so∣ever, to come within the English bounds, without those Badges up∣on them, or one with a badge in their Company; and if any Da∣mage or Injury be done to any Englishman, by them, or any of them, that then the King, or Great-man of the Place, the badges denote, shall be answerable for it. And, if any shall, notwithstanding this In∣junction, be found in our bounds, without an such badge, or not accompanied with one that shall have them; that then it shall be lawful for any Englishman, to carry him, or them, before any Justice of the Peace, who shall keep him, or them in safe Custody, until their King, or Great-man, ransome them by paying one hundred Arms length of Roranoke, for each <HI>Indian</HI> so taken, to be disposed of by the Publick: Provided alwayes, That if an Englishman shall be found, or proved, to have taken away any of their Badges,
<PB N="79" REF="45"/> thereby to make the <HI>Indians</HI> guilty of breaking this Law; that then the Person so offending, shall be set in the Pillory two hours on the <HI>Court</HI>-day, in the County where they have committed the Offence, with their Fault in Great Letters written upon them; and to be fi∣ned Five Thousand Pounds of Tobacco, to the use of the Publick; and, in case of disability, lye six Months in Prison without Bail or Main-prize.</P>
<P>And be it further Enacted, That all <HI>Indian</HI> Kings, Tributary to the English, when they have the least notice of an March by any strange <HI>Indians,</HI> neer our Quarters, shall repair themselves, or at least, send some one of their Great-men to the next of the <HI>Militia,</HI> which shall be nominated and appointed by the Governour, for that purpose; and acquaint him, with as much as they know, concern∣ing the Nation, the Numbers, and which way, they conceive, they will bend their Course. And, if they then shall desire any aid from us, to secure them, that a Party be sent presently out by the Colonel of the <HI>Militia,</HI> to that purpose; which by this Our As∣sistance and Reciprocal care will make them and us have an equal Interest in others preservation; while on the other side, we being ignorant of the Marches of Forreiners, impute all Damages, we then receive, which is then commonly most to our Neighbours, how Innocent soever.</P>
<P>And be it further enacted, That if any <HI>Indian</HI> by the Inveighling of any English, or of his own will, shall without leave of the King, or Great-man of the place, come within the Bounds limited them, and there procure harbour or entertainment, it shall be lawful for any Englishman, to take the said <HI>Indian,</HI> and convey him to his Town to be punished; and to recover of the Englishman, that har∣boured or entertained him, so much <HI>per</HI> day, as by the Law for en∣tertaining other Run-awayes, is recoverable.</P>
<P>And be it further enacted, That what Englishman, Trader, or Other, shall bring in any <HI>Indians,</HI> as Servants, and shall assign them over to any other, shall not sell them for Slaves, nor for any other time, then English of the like ages, should serve by Act of Assem∣bly.</P>
<P>And because heretofore many entertained <HI>Indians</HI> by Licenses of particular Persons, who did much Damage to their Neighbours; Be it henceforth enacted, That no Person of what quality soever, shall entertain any of our Neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI> as servants, or otherwise, unless by a License obtained from the Governour himself, upon their Obligation, that desire it, to be answerable for all the Injuries and Damages, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> by them entertained, shall do to any English.</P>
