<HEAD>The first part of the History of the famous <HI>Euordanus,</HI> Prince of Denmarke; with his aduentures, and fortune in Loue.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. How King <HI>Frederick</HI> and his Queene walking to take the ayre, were assaulted by a company of Out-lawes, &amp; how the Queene was deliuered of a child in the Forrest.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OU may read in the Chronicles of Den∣marke, of the great loue betwéene King <HI>Frederick,</HI> &amp; the famous <HI>Allisonne,</HI> Coun∣tesse of Flaunders. And how that after a long contention, betwéene the said <HI>Frede∣rick,</HI> and <HI>Griffory</HI> Duke of Holland, the King married her in the great Cittie of Gaunt, to the ex∣treame griefe of the said <HI>Griffory,</HI> who therevpon gaue o∣uer all martiall exercises for a season, vntill such time as hée was reuenged, as you may more at large read of in the said Chronicle, written by one <HI>Cleonido</HI> a Dane.</P>
<P>Not long after the said marriage, the King hauing set∣led the estate of that Earledome, returned into Denmarke with his beautifull Quéene, where at the arriuall, they were receiued with great honour and triumph by his subiects, who loued him as intirely, as it was possible for any subiects to loue their Prince, as appeared by their so∣lemne processions, ringing of bells, staitly pagants, and other gallant shewes, which were presented vnto him in euery Towne hée passed through. But comming into <HI>Ma∣iance,</HI> which then was the chiefe Cittie of the kingdome,
<PB REF="4"/> hee was presented with such varietie of pleasing shewes, that it passeth my capacitie to describe them, likewise there were many excellent and learned Orations, pronounced by the chiefe schollers of the Vniuersity of <HI>Maiance,</HI> setting foorth the great loue of the people toward their Prince, and the ioy conceaued of his marriage with so excellent a Lady as was his Quéene. On the otherside, the King to grate∣fie his subiects louing mindes, shewed himselfe bountifull and liberall vnto all, to some by gifts, to others by promi∣ses and fayre words, and to all by pleasing iestures, so that one might rightly say, there was in him the liuely portra∣ture of a most graue and prudent Prince, and in them the true shew of faithfull and louing subiects.</P>
<P>But as it alwaies hapneth, when men think themselues in greatest felicitie, then whether it be by the instabilitie of Fortune, or else that the Fates and destinies haue so ap∣pointed it, they are oftentimes suddenly tumbled downe, into griefe and miserie. Euen so it hapned with the King and Quéene, who liuing a while in this content, were sud∣denly driuen into great cares and perplexitie. Wherby we may perceiue, the diuine power of God to be such, that hée can pull downe Princes from their thrones, and restore them againe at his pleasure, as sometimes he did by <HI>Nabu∣cadnezar</HI> and others, to the setting foorth of his glorie and power.</P>
<P>Now was it hard about the Month of May, when as the fields and woods were deckt with <HI>Floras</HI> broode, and on each spray sate louely birds, resounding heauenly harmo∣nie. The pretie Nitingall, setting her speckled breast a∣gainst a bryer, regarded not fond <HI>Terius</HI> foule desire, but chaunted forth her pleasant ditties. When as the King and Quéene, accompanied with a small traine of Lordes and Ladies whom they loued, one morning early stale forth of the Court secretly, to disport thēselues in the forrest, which was hard adioyning vnto the Citty walls, where they had not long remained, beholding the broad-shaded Okes, and stately loftie Pines, before that a company of Out-lawes,
<PB REF="4"/> who were banished the Kingdome of Fraunce, had espyed them, and séeing they were no better prouided, set on them. Where one might haue beheld the Quéene and her Ladies so affrighted with this sudden accident, fling vp &amp; downe, some hiding themselues in one bush, some in another. O∣thers againe béeing more timerous, suncke downe where they stoode, not béeing able to flie away. But all was one, flie or tarry, for béeing pursued, they were all taken, and brought backe, sauing onely the Quéene, who béeing car∣ried forwards with the wings of feare, made such hast that shée escaped them all, béeing so appointed by the prouidence of God.</P>
<P>The King likewise &amp; Noblemen béeing amazed at this vnlooked for euent, knew not well suddenly what to deter∣mine, but in the end, séeing no other remedy, resolued to defend themselues as well as they might. The King being at that time one of the most accomplished Knights in all Europe, layd on such blowes amongst them, that hee made an euident shew that hee was determined to sell his life at an extreame déere rate. But beeing vnarmed, and hauing no other weapon but his sword, and all his company bee∣ing slaine out-right sauing two, who were likewise grie∣uously wounded, was forst perforce to yéelde to theyr pitti∣lesse mercy: who hauing obtaind victory, stript them all, as well Lords as Ladies of their coyne, and abilliments which were ought worth. And binding those whom they thought might any waies worke them displeasure, as by raysing power to pursue them, or vnbinding their fellows, they determined spéedily to depart towards the Sea coast, where some of their company remained, with two small Barks, wherewith they crost the seas. But as they were ready to depart, it came into one of their mindes, that some of them whom they had robbed, might peraduenture be such persons, for whose raunsome, they might get more coyne then all theyr booty was worth: wherefore demaun∣ding of one of the Ladies whō they had bound, what they were, was giuen to vnderstand, that hee who made the
<PB REF="5"/> greatest resistance was the King, the other two which were liuing, both noble men of his Court. Then calling to his mind, the great hate betwéene the said King, and <HI>Grif∣fory</HI> Duke of Holland, determined if he could, to cary him with him, and to present him to the Duke, of whom he ho∣ped to receiue some great reward. Wherefore intreating his fellowes, who knew not whō they had robbed, so grant him so much fauour, as to permit him to haue that Knight for his prisoner, in regard as knowing him heeretofore in Fraunce, fayning that there he had doone great despight to a friend of his, in reuenge whereof hee would deliuer him into his hands, whom he knew would kéepe him in eternal prison for his former offence. Nowe if they would be con∣tented to grant this vnto him, hee would séeke for no other part of their bootie.</P>
<P>They all béeing more gréedy of pray then of prisoners, who they thought might rather be a charge, then profit vn∣to them, were content to graunt vnto his request. Who presently went and vnbound the King, and so led him di∣rectly towards theyr shipping. And hauing winde at will, presently wayed Ancor, and set into the Sea, where wee will leaue them for awhile, and returne to the Quéene, who by her swift flight, mist the hands of the thieues, but fell into as great or greater ill. For whilst the King and the other Lords held the thieues somewhat short, by defending themselues, as is before declared, the fearefull Quéene fly∣ing into the wood for safety, strayed two and fro shee wist not whether. At length, béeing wearied with running, and fainting still with feare, shée sate her downe vnder a Iu∣niper bush, to refresh her selfe, where after shee had awhile rested her selfe, shée began to call to mind, and consider in what great danger shée had left her Lord &amp; husband, then reprouing herselfe, for that she had not rather made choyce to haue stayed and ended her dayes with him, then thus to haue romed she wist not whether. Then rising vp, shee de∣termined to haue returned to the same place where she left them fighting, but strayed further, so that tracing and tra∣uersing
<PB REF="5"/> vp and downe the wood, shee spent the whole day to her no small griefe. And now darke night hauing spred her sable mantle ouer the face of the earth, the sorrowfull Quéene, not knowing what to doe, or whether to goe, de∣termined to take vp her lodging for y<SUP>t</SUP> night, vnder a broade branched Oake, fast by a fountaines side, wheras the wild beasts of the Forrest did commonly resort to drinke, where good Lady shée was forced to content herselfe with a hun∣gry pittance, teares béeing her daintiest dish, whereon shée fedde, sometimes exclayming on cruell fortune, whom shée accused to haue brought her into these miseries: then pre∣sently her husbands portrature séemed to appeare vnto her minde, whom she thought to be murdred by those robbers, which was such a griefe vnto her, that many times she was minded to haue slaine her selfe, had not God mightily pre∣serued her to a further setting forth of his glory.</P>
<P>Thus past shée away most part of the night with wee∣ping and lamentations, vntill such time that <HI>Somnus</HI> with his leaden wings seased her eye-lids, and caused her for a while to slumber. In which sléepe, shee thought an Angell sent from God, being clothed all in white rayment, appea∣red vnto her, saying, Bee of good hart and feare not, for these crosses which now are come vpon thée, the Lord hath sent to proue thée with all, and therefore it behooueth thée to beare it patiently, vntill such time as the Lord shall ease thée of them. As for the King thy husband he liueth, but yet in bands, and shall doe still, vntill such time as the childe that now is in thy wombe, shall be his deliuerer, whom thou at his birth shalt name <HI>Euordanus,</HI> this nowe am I sent to tell thee, because thou shouldest not dispayre.</P>
<P>The Quéene héereat awaked out of her slumber, and looking about if she might sée any body, but could not, then perceiuing it to be a dreame, or vision, meruailed what it might signifie, &amp; was greatly troubled with deuising there∣of: so that all the night after shee could take no rest, some∣times thinking of her husband, and sometimes what the childes deliuerance might meane, at length determined to
<PB REF="6"/> referre all to the mercifull prouidence of God. Thus sits shée poore sorrowfull Lady, till such time as by the singing of the chéerefull Larke, &amp; by the roaring of the wild beasts, shée was preparing to forsake Dame <HI>Thetis</HI> lodging, and that nights sable mantle was changed into a hoary gray. When loe, as was their wont, the sauage beasts came vn∣to the well to drink, there did shee with feare beholde the statelie Vnicorne, with the cruell Tiger, y<SUP>e</SUP> roaring Beare, and gaudy Panther, the bellowing Bull, &amp; foming Bore, the rauening Wolfe, and craftie Foxe, with diuers more, which put her in such feare, that she had thought presently to haue béen deuoured, when salling on her knées, and hol∣ding vp her hands, she said these or such like words.</P>
<P>O most mercifull Lord God, I doe here acknowledge be∣fore thy diuine maiestie, my manifolde and innumerable sins committed against thy diuine maiesty both in thought, word, and déed, O Lord I am not worthy so much as once to looke vp to heauen, much lesse to receiue any thing at thy hands O Lord. Yet mercifull Father, trusting in the me∣rits of thy déerely beloued sonne, our Lord and Sauiour Christ Iesus, I come vnto thée in his name, crauing for∣giuenesse of all my sinnes and iniquities. And further, O Lord God, I humbly beséech thée to saue and deliuer mée, from this present danger, and perrill of my wretched life, O Lord bow downe thy heauenly eye, and behold mee thy wofull handmaide, and likewise this poore infant that is within my wombe, defend it, O Lord, and grant that ac∣cording vnto the vision which thou by thy holy Angell hast shewed mee, it may liue to set foorth thy glory and power, and in the end, when it shall be thy blessed will, to call vs out of this wretched vale of wickednes, thou wilt receiue and place vs in thy Celestiall kingdome, whether O Lord for thy sonnes sake bring vs I beséech thée.</P>
<P>These, or such like were the words, which she distressed Lady then vttered: when behold a mightie surious Lyon came rushing out of the wood towards her, bringing in his mouth a cake of Bread, which he most gently layd downe
<PB REF="6"/> at her féete, fawning vpon her, as if of long time he had bin acquainted with her, and would not depart from her. At length, somewhat to recomfort herselfe, then smoothing his rough bristles with her tender hand, she made much of him laying his head on her lap, wherat he séemed to take great content. Then taking vp the cake of bread which hee had brought her, and giuing thanks vnto God, imagining as sometimes in the wildernes hee had sent Rauens to feede the Prophet <HI>Elias,</HI> so likewise had hee now sent the Lion to comfort and bring her foode, she refreshed therwith her hun∣gry stomacke. After which repast, the Lyon very softly pa∣ced towards the wood againe, euer casting backe his head, as if he looked whether y<SUP>e</SUP> Lady followed him or not, which shée at length perceiuing, determined to follow him, hoping thereby either to get out of the wood, or else to finde some better place of safety. Thus went they together, till at last he brought her vnto a Caue vnderneath the ground, with a very narrow entrance in, but béeing entred, shée found it a reasonable large roome. Thus determining for a while to remaine th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such time as God should send her better fortune, passing away the time some whiles with walking about the woods néere the Caue, otherwhiles with playing with the Lyon, who euery day brought her in meate, such as he got abrode in the Forrest, which she sometimes scor∣ched and dryed in the sunne, otherwhiles was forced to eate it raw, vntill such time as by hap one day walking abroad, she found a flint stone, with which afterwards shee vsed to strike fire, and therewith would broyle her meate. Thus continued she, vntill such time, that according to the natu∣rall course of women, her time of childe-birth was come. When as good Lady, féeling the paines thereof, to her most strange and extreame, not hauing any to comfort and help her, she fell againe into her wonted passion of dolour, com∣plaining of her cruell fortune, which had depriued her of all helpe and comfort, &amp; had brought her into this extreame sorrow &amp; paines. But euen then, in the midst of her com∣plaints, God pittying her griefe, sent her safe deliuerance
<PB REF="7"/> of a most goodly and beautiful boy, which when she beheld, according to the saying of the Scripture, she forgate all her former sorrow, reioycing that a man child was borne into the world: and giuing thanks vnto God, she tooke the child vp in her armes, and beholding it, she imagined that in him she saw the liuely figure of the King her husband. And ma∣king such shift as shee could to wrap him vp in clothes, shee beheld on his right shoulder a well proportioned crosse, which séemed farre redder then the rest of his body, wherat shée greatly meruailed: then calling to minde her vision, she hoped that in time he should prooue a famous man, and a scourge vnto the enemies of the Christian faith, as shee thought the signe of the Crosse did already foreshew, then likewise remembring the name which the Angell had tolde her in her vision, as soone as she had recouered strength to goe, went with her sonne to the fountaine, where shee bap∣tized him, naming him as she was willed, <HI>Euordanus,</HI> then returned she againe to the Caue, where wee will leaue her for a while with her young Infant, and returne to speake of the King her husband.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. How King <HI>Fredericke</HI> being carried away by the Out-lawes, after a great storme at sea arriued in Holland, whereas he was sold to his mortall enemie, the Duke <HI>Griffory.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter the Out-lawes had brought theyr boo∣tie and good King aboord, and had set sayle, minding to haue gone for some place of Fraunce, where they might haue secretlie stolne ashore, to learne some newes of theyr owne affayres, and hauing the wind large, determined to haue landed in a small cricke not farre from Rotchell, be∣cause most of them were héeretofore inhabitants of that Towne, but euen as they were come within the sight of Land, on a sudden the Skyes began to ouercast, the sunne was clowded, and the face of heauen was so darkned, that
<PB REF="7"/> one could not discerne at that present time, beeing about no one dayes from the darkest midnight: the winds began to blow on all sides, as if that <HI>Eolus</HI> had vnstopped all his ayrie Caue, and had determined with one assault to haue subdued <HI>Neptunes</HI> Regiments. Or as when the angry Goddesse <HI>Iuno</HI> gréeuing at the quiet passage of the poore vanquisht Troians, desired <HI>Eolus</HI> to sinke them in the sea: so fared it with them, by reason that the seas on all sides béeing so assaulted of the windes, did so cruelly rage and storme, that sometimes theyr small Barks did séeme to touch the very clowdes, and presently againe were throwne downe vnto the sands, euery man imagining that to be the last houre of theyr liues. Some, as is commonlie the custome of such people béeing in extremity, fel to prayer, othersome to cursing and swearing: the Maister cries in with the sayles, others cry downe with the Mast, some a∣gaine, to lighten their Barke of her burthen, the more yar∣ly to rise with the Seas, beginne to throw ouer boord all whatsoeuer comes to hand, hoping thereby, as with a plea∣sing sacrifice, to appease the angry Seas.</P>
<P>But euen as they were thus busied, some on one thing, others on another thing, a mighty gust in manner of a Whirlewind, comming out of the South-west, beares both masts and sayles by the burden. The Barke wherein the King was, hauing spent both their fore and maine Mast, were forced to put to hull, yéelding themselues to the pitti∣lesse mercy of the wind and seas, which euery minute was ready to haue deuoured &amp; swallowed them vp. Thus conti∣nued the storme by the space of thrée dayes, the wind some∣times in their forshyp, then in theyr poupe, nowe in the quarter, and presently againe in theyr bowe, continuing with such force, that the best man aboord was scarcely able to stand on the hatches. But at length, as euery storme hath an end, so now <HI>Neptune</HI> rousing himselfe out of his fayre Quéene <HI>Amphitries</HI> bosome, and beholding she poore distressed Marriners, tooke pitty on theyr miseries, and lif∣ting his hoary head aboue the waters, asswaged them, and
<PB REF="8"/> with his thrée-forked Mace rebuked the Windes, threat∣ning to punish theyr arrogant presumption, if he héereafter hapned to find them with the like offence.</P>
<P>The storme béeing thus broken vp, and the Sunne be∣ginning againe to lighten the earth with his splendant beames, the weather-beathen Marriners looking abroade for theyr comfort, espied the Land, which after they had a while with ioy beheld, they made to be the Land of <HI>Hol∣land.</HI> Who then so glad as <HI>Martinus,</HI> for so was hée called which had the King to his prisoner, for whom he hoped ere long to receiue such a summe of money, as for euer should make him rich: the King on the other side was in as great perplexity, knowing that they were arriued on the coast of his greatest enemy, yet comforting himselfe somewhat with the hope of not beeing knowne, as also of not knowing <HI>Martinus</HI> meaning, he shewed himselfe the more chéerefull. Thus betwéene hope and feare, they altogether passed a∣way the time, in merry discourses of theyr former danger, till such time as they were come on land, at a Port called <HI>Alentmaer,</HI> where <HI>Martinus</HI> fayning himselfe to be verie ill at ease, by reason of the late storme, craued leaue of the rest of his company, to goe with his prisoner vnto the Citty of <HI>Hanstance,</HI> which was not passing thrée leagues of, now called <HI>Ansterdam:</HI> where hee determined to rest himselfe, vntill such time as hee found himselfe throughly amended, which they soone graunted him, not knowing his intent, and beeing also willing to be ridde of his company, because of his double charge.</P>
<P>So departed <HI>Martinus</HI> with his prisoner, whom he swore so continue true vnto him: as fearing his escape, being to trauell but they two together, but the King being in his enemies country, durst not make himselfe knowne, which he must needes, if he had made any resistance. Thus tra∣uelling on together towards <HI>Hanstance,</HI> they ariued there at such time, as the blushing sunne plucking in his smiling beames, making his steedes to mende their wonted place, and plunging downe into the Ocean streames, there in
<PB REF="8"/> the frothy waues did hide his face, leauing the earth coue∣red with nights darksome shade: wherefore that night they tooke vp their lodging, <HI>Martinus</HI> learning of his haost, how Duke <HI>Griffory</HI> hauing euer since she marriage of the King of Denmarke, and the faire Lady <HI>Allison</HI> of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> giuen ouer all pleasure, was withdrawne from his Court into the Country, some eight miles distance from the Cittie: where hauing built a lodge in a maruilous soli∣tarie place, hee passed the time in mellancholly humors, somewhiles playing on the Lute some mournefull ditties, otherwhiles, ingrauing in the trees on the ground Verses and Sonnets, féeding his humors with such vaine toies, to the great griefe of all his subiects: and how in all that time he neuer had sufferd any one to come into his presence, or to speake with him, sauing a smale company of his atten∣dants, which remained there with him. When <HI>Martinus</HI> had heard all this, he determined y<SUP>e</SUP> next day to goe thether, and to make knowne vnto him those things, which should soone put him out of his melancholy dumpes. The next morning very early he was rissen vp, and comming to the King, told him how that hee had some occasion of busines in the Country, which would cause him to be away a day or two, wherefore hee was determined in the meane time, leauing him behind him, to cause him once more to sweare vnto him, to remaine vntill his returne, which if hee refu∣sed, that then he would commit him vnto some prison with∣in the Cittie, whereas hee should bee alwaies foorth com∣ming at his pleasure. The King listning attentiuely vnto his speech, was driuen into a thousand imaginations, not knowing what was best for him to doe, at length consi∣dering his former oath, which rather then he would violate, he would chuse to indure any death whatsoeuer, so much did he estéeme of his Kingly oath: hee answered him thus. I knowe not what your meaning may bee, in this sort to doubt my former promise, and to goe about by a new oath to assure your selfe of me: if to set me to ransome, I heere fréely proffer my selfe to goe a long with you into any place,
<PB REF="9"/> out of this accursed region, and there to remaine, vntill such time that the same bee payed vnto you, although it should amounte vnto an hundred thousand pounds, rather then that you should deliuer me, into the hands of the Go∣uernor of this accursed Country, who is my mortall ene∣mie.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, replied <HI>Martinus,</HI> being blinded with couetous∣nes, and hoping for a greater summe of monie: there is no such matter ment, but I haue not farre off a friend, whose councell I minde to followe heerein: in the meane time chuse whether you will remaine in prison, or vppon your oath. The King séeing no remedie, sware vnto him againe to continue his true prisoner, although it cost him his life.</P>
<P>Then departed <HI>Martinus,</HI> towards the Dukes lodge, where béeing arriued, and desiring conference with his grace, touching such matters as néerely concerned him, he was at length brought into a garden, in forme much like vnto an endlesse laborinth, so many were the diuers and sundry walkes and allies, couered with many kinds of trees, which yeilded such a close shadow, that the Sunne with his splendant beames could scarse shinne through: and passing thus from one walke into another, he came at length where the Duke sate in an Arbor of Baies, beeing clothed all in blacke, signifying his great sorrowe which he sustained, and hauing a Lute in his hand, was playing a mornefull dittie, which he euen then had framed, to which <HI>Martinus</HI> and his guide a while listned, vnséene by reason of the thicknes of the Arbor.</P>
<P>At length comming néerer, and with reuerence saluting his excellencie, <HI>Martinus</HI> spake as followeth.</P>
<P>Most mightie and puissant Prince, I cannot but woun∣der that you who heeretofore, were wont to spend your time in most honorable exercises, as Tilt and Turnie, and following hautie déedes of Chiualrie, should so giue your selfe ouer vnto this solitarie kind of life, neither regarding your owne estate, nor the estate of your louing subiects and Country: which would spend their very liues to worke
<PB REF="9"/> your content. But if I bee not deceaued, this strange hu∣mor wherewith you are possest, procéedeth from contrarie occasions, the one is the extreame hate you beare vnto the King of Denmarke, the other ouer much loue towards the beautifull Quéene his wife, not knowing with your selfe what way to be reuenged of him, nor how to regaine her loue. But suppose most mighty Prince, I should worke the meanes of your reuenge, by deliuering him into your hands, would not it content you? yea would you not more reioyce thereof, then to haue gained the greatest Cittie in Christendome, and likewise reward him, that should effect the same to his content: speake O worthy Duke, were not these the occasions of thy griefe, and would not this like∣wise be the chiefest medicine to sease thy sorrowe.</P>
<P>Scarce were these last words vttered, when the Duke starting vp, and staring him in the face, as one wakned out of sound sléepe, thus replied. Friend, whatsoeuer thou art that séekest by a fayned and filed tale, to driue me out of my sad passions; knowe that to iest with Princes is not tollerable: But if thou canst performe, that whereof thou hast made showe of, I will not be slacke in rewarding thée for thy paines, though thou shouldest demaunde halfe my Dukedome. Therefore tell me by what meanes this may be accomplished: then effect and bring it to passe, and I will reward thée to thy owne content. Worthy Duke re∣plied <HI>Martinus,</HI> if I performe it not, then let my head bee striken from my shoulders, conditionally that if I doe deli∣uer into thy hands, that vnhappie King, I may haue for my reward the Citty of <HI>Hanstance</HI> during my life, with the profits thereof: and this confirme vnto mee before your Nobilitie, and then I will deliuer him into your hands, within this eight daies next comming.</P>
<P>The Duke being filled with ioy, with this his so com∣fortable newes, consented vnto whatsoeuer he demanded, and calling for a Knight which was néerest vnto him, wil∣led him to sommon his Counsell the next day, to bee atten∣dant to heare a matter of importance, which he would show
<PB REF="10"/> vnto them: which was foorthwith accomplished, euery one the next day at their houre appointed, beeing ready in the Counsell chamber, to heare what should be their Princes will: euery one greatly meruailing what soden motion, was entred in his head, considering that by the space of a yéere before, he had neuer conferred with them of any mat∣ter, no nor once suffered them to come into his presence. They being as I haue sayd gathered together in the Coun∣sell chamber, the Duke leading <HI>Martinus</HI> by the hand, came vnto them, where he declared his intent, with the promise of <HI>Martinus:</HI> all which was consented vnto by them, hoping thereby to haue their Prince in his former estate of content: Assuring vnto <HI>Martinus</HI> vnder their hands and seales, that whatsoeuer the Duke had made promise of, they would see it performed, so soone as hée should deliuer the King of Denmarke into their hands. Héere will I leaue them to tell of the great griefe, made through all Denmarke, for the losse of their King and Quéene.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. How the King and Queene beeing found missing, were sought for, and how the Lords and Ladies that were with them were found.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He same morning that the King and Quéene went to recreate themselues in the forrest, as is before declared, they were not foūd missing, till such time as y<SUP>e</SUP> tables being spred for diner, and many Lords and Ladies, Knights, Squi∣ers, and Gentlemen, being assembled together to giue their attendance on his Maiestie, maruailed that hee was so long, before he came downe into the great Hall, contra∣rie to his vse, which was alwaies wont to be by tenne of the clocke, where he remained vntill dinner time, passing away the time with mirth and pleasant disports. At length hauing expected his comming vntill twelue of the clocke,
<PB REF="10"/> and séeing that he came not, the Lord Treasure, whose name was Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> musing what the cause might be, and doubting that all was not well, in regard hee neither came himselfe, neither any of the Squiers, which were at∣tending néerest vnto him were séene to come downe, to de∣clare the cause, at length went vp vnto the Kings bed∣chamber, where hee found the Chamberlin with diuers o∣ther Gentlemen, which alwaies attended on the Kings owne person. And demaunding of them where his Maie∣stie was, that he came not downe in the Hall as he was accustomed, they all gaue him answere, that the King and Quéene, accompanied with the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> his Cosin, the Lord <HI>Bewdall,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> with some La∣dies and attendants, in the morning very early went forth at the Posterne, towards the Forrest to take the fresh aire, and that since that time they were not returned, neither did they know farther what was become of them, but doubted least that they had strayed so farre within the wood, that they had lost their way forth. When Sir <HI>Henault</HI> had hard this, he was much amased, &amp; greatly troubled in mind, fea∣ring least there had béene some treason wrought against his Maiestie: wherefore causing the reporters of these newes, to be in sure kéeping, he went downe, and declared the same to the rest of the nobility, and taking counsell to∣gether, they determined forthwith to make ageneral search, as well for the King and Quéene, and nobles found wan∣ting, as also for all suspected persons, which might bée thought any waies guilty towards their absence: likewise they determined, to make a generall search throughout all the Forrest, least peraduenture, they were hapned to goe a∣stray, and could not find the ready way backe againe, or if that they were any way distressed, either by théeues or wild beasts, that then they might rescue them, or find what was become of them.</P>
<P>Thus hauing determined, they armed themselues, to the number of thrée thousand, Knights and Gentlemen, and being mounted on their horses, they tooke the way di∣rectly
<PB REF="11"/> towards the Forrest, where beeing ariued they se∣perated themselues into diuers companies, séeking vp and downe, and looking almost in euery bush, but could not find them whom they sought for, at length Sir <HI>Henault</HI> with his companie hapning to passe that way, wherein the morning the fight had béene, chaunced first to finde some of the dead bodies, and looking farther, sawe whereas the Lords and Ladies lay bound, being almost dead with the paine and griefe which they sustained, y<SUP>e</SUP> Lords by rea∣son of their wounds, and Ladies by the feare wherein they were put: then comming more néere vnto them, they found the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> grieuously wounded, the Lord <HI>Bewdall</HI> with some foure or fiue other Gentlemen slaine out right, which sight strake such a griefe and sorrow into the harts of all the beholders, especially of Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> that he had much to doe to sit on his horse, yet at length recouering his sences, and causing them to be vnbound, he demaunded what was become of the King and Quéene, and by what misfortune they were brought into this pittifull case.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> hauing his wounds bound vp, and being somewhat refreshed and reuiued with such restora∣tiues, as some of the companie had brought with them, an∣swered, how that walking to take the aire, and to view those pleasant shades, they were sodenly and vnawares set on by forty théeues or Outlawes, whom by their apparrell and spéech, they iudged to be frenchmen, where defending themselues as well as they might, were in the end thus ouercome and wounded: and as for the King, after they had bound vs and were departing away, hauing before stripped vs of the wealth we had about vs, they returned and tooke him with them, towards the sea-side. But of the Quéene, we knowe no certainty, for whilst we were figh∣ting she fled into the wood, with the rest of the Ladies, who were all brought back againe saue the Quéene only, by some of the Outlawes who persued them: more I knowe not, but feare least they likewise hapned on her, and haue
<PB REF="11"/> carried her with them: wherefore he thought it fit that pur∣sute might be made after them to the seawards, where if they were not already gone, it might so fortune as they might recouer the King and Quéene againe, otherwise there would be no hope left for séeing them in hast.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Henault</HI> had heard this discourse made by the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> he was so grieued inwardly, that with extreame sorrowe he fell from his horse in a trance, and be∣ing brought againe to himselfe, séeing all things were to be followed according to the occasion and time, first he com∣maunded, some part of his companie to conuaie the Lords and Ladies to the Court, whereas they that were woun∣ded might find helpe for to cure the same: and they likewise that were slaine, might euery one haue buriall according to their estates: himselfe in the meane space being accom∣panied with a hundred Knights, would followe after the théeues, hoping that if they were not put to sea before their comming, not only to rescue the King, but also to giue them such a reward as for euer should bee an example, to those who should goe about to attempt the like. With this deter∣mination they rode on towards the sea side, whereas they arriued, about the time, when <HI>Vesperus,</HI> in the west had set the cunning watch, and silent night richly attended by his twinckling traine, sent sléepe and slumber to possesse the world, and fantazie for to hazan idle heads, whereas they found their labor fruitlesse, by reason that they were departed long before: and séeing the night beginne to wax darke, they all together determined on the plaine, hard by the sea side for that night to rest themselues, making fiers and great lights to cause the rest of their companies to come vnto them, who likewise had made a long and bootlesse search in the wood, and at length being almost all come to∣gether, where Sir <HI>Henault</HI> remained, they determined the next day to make preperation to follow them by sea, whom they could not recouer on shore.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IIII. Of the generall lamentation that was made throughout all the Kingdome, and how that after a councell held for the gouerning thereof, the Knights and noble men tooke on them the search of the King.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE next day, no sooner had darke night ta∣ken his leaue, and that the day began to ap∣peare in the East, but Sir <HI>Henault</HI> with the rest of his company, were mounted on hors∣back, taking their way towards the sorrow∣full Cittie of <HI>Maiance,</HI> where béeing arriued, they found the Citty all full of heauines, by reason of the late newes, which at their comming was so much the more augmen∣ted, being returned without any certaine knowledge what was become of the King and Quéene. There might you haue séene the true discription of sorrow, not in one onelie creature, but in generall through the whole Cittie: some fell to shutting vp their doores and windowes, as minding for very griefe to inclose themselues prisoners in their own houses, shunning the day light, which had giuen light to those Robbers, who had dispoyled them of their ioy and comfort. Others againe clad in blacke mournfull attire, with their chéeks be spred with teares, which like streames trickled downe from the fountaines of their eyes, went vp and downe lamenting and bewailing the losse of theyr so louing and gracious Prince. The late costly shewes, and stately Pagants, were turned into sadde obiects: yea, no noyse was heard through the whole Cittie, but wéeping and lamentation, so that the sorrow sustained by the Tro∣ians, for the losse of their chiefe Champion <HI>Hector,</HI> when by the Gréeks, at the commaundement of cruell <HI>A∣chilles,</HI> he was thrée times dragd about their Cittie walls, béeing before hand cowardly slaine with his accursed Speare, was not to bee compared with this of <HI>Maiance.</HI> The graue and modest Matrons, were séene with theyr
<PB REF="12"/> garments rent, and their haire dispersed about their shoul∣ders, in most dolefull manner to repayre to the Temples, where before the most Highest, they poured foorth theyr prayers for their Soueraigne, bathing themselues with the teares which fell from their eyes. The young damsels pleasant songs, which with cléere and chéerfull brests they were wont to record, were now turned into sad &amp; mourn∣full ditties, bewailing the losse of their Countries protec∣tor. Yea, so generall was the gréefe vnto all manner of e∣states, that for the space of fortie dayes together, there was neither shops opened, nor any wares or merchandise solde in their markets. So that the towne, which was wont to be so filled with all sorts of people, now séemed in a manner to be voyde &amp; desolate, none, or very few séene at any time to walke in the stréets. Neither was the griefe in the coun∣try any lesse, yea throughout the whole kingdome: so ge∣nerally was he beloued of all his subiects, y<SUP>t</SUP> hee was coun∣ted not onely a iust Prince, but also a louing Father to his Country, alwaies defending the poore from the oppression of the rich, and the desolate widdowes and Orphans, from the violence of those, who by any meanes sought to wrong them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> as we haue before said, béeing returned to <HI>Maiance,</HI> caused foorthwith some small Barkes to be well manned and sent foorth after the Pyrats, with commaund not onely to scoure their owne Coast, but also to pursue thē vnto the borders of <HI>Fraunce:</HI> where they tooke many, but could not méet with any of thē which they sought for. Then calling a generall Counsell of all the Nobility and Péeres of the Land, where after a long &amp; learned Oration by him pronounced, describing vnto them, the fickle and dange∣rous estate wherein their Country now stoode, by reason of this sudden and vnlooked for alteration of crooked For∣tune, with the mutabilitie of the minds of the common peo∣ple, whose natures are alwaies to listen after nouelties. which things being considered, it could not chuse but to ap∣peare vnpossible, to kéepe the Common-wealth in safetie:
<PB REF="13"/> without some certaine forme of gouernment to be establi∣shed. Desiring all of them to bend and ioyne theyr willing minds together, to deuise some course or meanes for the same, vntill the King might againe be heard of and reco∣uered. Which hee thought could by no meanes better be effected, then by a generall search made by a chosen num∣ber of Knights, who should trauell through all the Domi∣nions and kingdoms of Christendome, and else-where, as by them it should be thought fit and conuenient: of which number, he himselfe God willing intended to be one, who would either finde him out, or end his dayes in the search.</P>
<P>This his spéech was listned vnto of all, but especiallie applauded and commended by the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> who as then were indifferently recouered of their wounds, which they receiued at the losse of theyr King: and béeing both young and valerous, especiallie <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> who was then the absolute best Knight in all the kingdome of Denmarke, hoped by this meanes not onely to find out their King, if so be he liued, but also to winne to themselues eternall renowne, by their haughtie déedes of Chiualrie, which they hoped to obtaine in strange Coun∣tries, where their fortunes should conduct them. But as for the gouernment of the Common-wealth, in theyr con∣ceits, they thought none more fit then Sir <HI>Henault</HI> him∣selfe, who béeing both sage and discréete, and also béeing as we haue said before, Lorde Treasurer, &amp; alwaies in great fauour with their late King, had in a maner the whole ma∣naging of the affaires of the Kingdome in his owne hands, by which meanes, as they supposed, he knew how, better then any other, to continue the same in the former estate, which would be farre better then to alter the same, by any other order of gouernment.</P>
<P>This their opinion was held for currant of many, and consented vnto by most of those that were present, who de∣sired no alteration, but thought their former manner of rule to be best, and without fault.</P>
<P>But as there is no man so vertuous, but shall haue some
<PB REF="13"/> that will enuy at his goodnes, especially great and migh∣tie men, who no sooner grow into the good liking and fa∣uour of the people, be it by neuer so iust or well deserued occasion, (yea though by him onely the Common-wealth hath béen in a manner preserued and defended from the in∣uasiue power of their enemies, (yet shall you haue some, like dogges in a manger, that will neither doo good them∣selues, nor willingly heare of others well dooings,) beeing prickt forwards with enuy, will not stick to turne any his good deseruings into euill, and all their counsels, be they neuer so profitable to the Common-wealth, they will goe about to perswade, that it is rather to benefit &amp; rayse them∣selues, then to doe good to their Countries: yea further, let them accomplish any notable péece of seruice for their coun∣try, they will not be afraide to whisper into mens eares, that it was doone but for vaine glory.) Euen such there were in this Counsell, who not onely for enuie, disliked the choyse which the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> and the rest had made, but also disliked of the search which Sir <HI>Henault</HI> had motioned for the séeking of the King, alleaging that by making such a quest, they should not onely dispoyle themselues of theyr chiefe Captaines and leaders, but also leaue theyr Coun∣try naked, and ready for euery inuasion of the enemy, when it would be too late to call home those for theyr de∣fence whom they should not know where to find. Some a∣gaine thought it better to send forth Embassadors into di∣uers Nations, thereby hoping to gaine knowledge, what was become of him: thinking that if the Out-lawes had kept him aliue, that then they had sold him to some Prince, who would be content to put him to raunsome. Others held, that to send foorth spyes, which by diligent inquirie might heare of him, would be the best course. Thus diuers men were of diuers minds, sitting a long while in counsell to no end, neither determining any order for the gouern∣ment of the Common-wealth, nor meanes to find out their King and Quéene. But at length, by the meanes of the Archbishop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> who desired change and alteration,
<PB REF="14"/> they grew to determine of their gouernment, which should be in this manner following.</P>
<P>First, they should chuse of the most sufficienst of the No∣bilitie, and Laitie of the Realme, the number of sixe-score, out of which number by lot they should chuse tenne, and of the Clergie thirtie, out of which nūber likewise they should chuse two by lot, so that of the Nobility there should be al∣waies tenne, and of the Clergie two, which twelue so elec∣ted, should haue the gouernment of the whole kingdom for a yéere, and at the yéeres end, to giue vp an account vnto the other sixe-score and eighteene, of the imployment of the treasure belonging to the Crowne: and then other twelue to be chosen in the same manner, for the next yere. And this order and manner of gouernment to be kept inuiolate, vn∣till such time as they should heare some certaine newes, ei∣ther of the Kings death, or returne. To this they all con∣sented, setting thereto their hands &amp; seales, presently ma∣king choyse of those whose happe should be first to gouerne this their new deuised state. The Lots béeing cast, the first twelue to whom the gouernment lighted, was of the Clergie, the Archbishop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>O∣delstoe:</HI> and of the Nobilitie, the Duke of <HI>Louenborge,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Newmister,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> the Count <HI>Her∣mes,</HI> the Countie of <HI>Mildorpe,</HI> the County of <HI>Opencade,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Londen,</HI> the Lord <HI>Itzenho,</HI> the Lorde of <HI>New∣stat,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Rensborge.</HI> These twelue, according to former agréement, tooke on them the gouernment of the kingdome, first setting all things in quiet within the king∣dome, and making diuers lawes and statutes for the pre∣seruation thereof. And then made preparation for the de∣fending of the same, if so be y<SUP>t</SUP> any neighbor Prince should now in the alteration of their gouernment, make any war or inuasion vppon them, thereby not to be taken vnproui∣ded. They therefore fortified diuers Castles, and strong Holds vppon the borders of the Kingdome, repairing those that were weake, and erecting new where they thought a∣ny néede to be, placing garrisons in them all, for y<SUP>e</SUP> defence
<PB REF="14"/> thereof. Likewise they tooke order, for the defence and sure kéeping of the Country of <HI>Flaunders</HI> in their subiection, fearing least vppon the report of the losse of the King and Quéene, there might be some alteration mooued, either by some neighbour Potentate, or the inhabitants themselues, who at that time were giuen altogether, to desire change and alteration.</P>
<P>Now amongst all these discourses wee must not forget the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> whose heroicke mindes not being able to bee contained within the confines of Denmarke, missing their onely comfort and solace, their noble Prince, whose presence was more déere to them, then any thing in the world be∣sides: prouided according to their former determinations, to trauell in his quest throughout the whole world, but that they would either find him out, or heare some certaine newes of him, which being made knowne, to diuers other Lords and Knights, there were to the number of a hun∣dred, all of the minde, bent either to find him out, or neuer to returne. Thus euery one in the best manner they could, made preperation for their iourney, fitting themselues both with armor, and store of money for their néedefull expences in their trauell. And being all in a readines to depart, they deuided themselues, some into one Country, and some in∣to another, appointing where many times to méete, being in strange Countries, where wee will leaue them, to de∣clare what befell to the King and <HI>Martinus,</HI> being in his e∣nemies Country, as is before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. How King <HI>Fredericke,</HI> was deliuered by <HI>Martinus,</HI> into the the hands of <HI>Griffory,</HI> by whom hee was imprisoned, and how <HI>Martinus</HI> by the Duke was afterward put to death.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou haue heard before, how <HI>Martinus</HI> had a∣gréed with <HI>Griffory</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> for the deli∣uery of the good King <HI>Fredericke,</HI> in recom∣pence whereof, he should haue for tearme of his life, the Cittie of <HI>Hanstance,</HI> withall the customes and profits thereof.</P>
<P>The next day after this conclusion, the Duke going a∣long with him to <HI>Hanstance,</HI> where being ariued, was by <HI>Martinus</HI> brought into the Burgesses house, where he left the King, who according to his oath he found there still re∣maining, little fearing that which suddenly hapned vnto him, for <HI>Martinus</HI> comming vnto him, and taking him by the hand, as if hee would haue conferred with him about his raunsome, brought him at length into a chamber, whereas he had left the Duke, accompanied with some few of his nobillitie, vnto whom <HI>Martinus</HI> spake as fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>Most high and mighty Prince, according vnto my faith∣full promise made vnto your excellencie, I héere before these your nobillity, deliuer vp into your hands, this vn∣fortunate and vnhappie King of Denmarke, of whom you may now at any time, be fully and sufficiently reuenged, of any former wrong by him committed against you, or of any displeasure, which worthily you haue conceaued a∣gainst him, and likewise so clip his wings, for euer héere∣after being able, to doe you the least offence whatsoeuer.</P>
<P>When the Duke had heard him speake this his pleasing, and to him most delightfull speech, scarce suffring him to make his conclusion, hauing also in the meane time throughly viewed the King, whom by diuers signes he ve∣rily knew to be the same, he could scarce content himselfe,
<PB REF="15"/> but would immediatly haue slaine him with his owne hands, so deadly was the hate he bare him, and such the in∣ciuillitie of his churlish and reuengfull nature: yet being stopped by some of his nobilitie from killing him, hee fell out into these or such like rayling speeches. O thou most accursed and vild caitife, whom were it not (that I meane to put thée to more extreame paine &amp; torments,) I would with these my hands, rent that detestable body of thine to peeces, and with my téeth teare and gnaw the flesh from thy bones, so endlesse is my malice against thée, and so ma∣ny thy wrongs and villanies committed, which causeth me to muse and inuent, what or how many kind of tor∣ments, I might inflict vpon thée. But would to God that disloyall strumpet, that infernall Quéene, the causer of all my miseries, yea she whose bewitching beauty, thou so much and with such a gréedinesse hast desired, yea and by thy comurations, and other thy detestable and execrable meanes, thou hast hetherunto to thy content inioyed: O that she were héere present, to behold and take part of those continuall paines and torments, the which not only for the hate I beare thée, but also to bee reuenged on her, for her most odious, whorish, and execrable dissimulation towards me, I meane to inflict vppon thy wretched carkas.</P>
<P>The good King being no longer able to forbeare, these inhumane and oprobrious reuilings, proffred him by his currish and spightfull enemie, replied in this sort: <HI>Griffory</HI> I cannot but muse, how God hauing indued thée, with reason and vnderstanding like vnto other men, that thou notwithstanding, shouldest abound in vicious, wicked, and detestable conditions aboue all other men, which canst not be content with the miserie, which thou séest me brought into, being thy prisoner, and at thy disposition, to be either kept or ransomed, wrought by the most base &amp; odi∣ous meanes that might be, yea after such a sort, that the beriest Infidell vnder the heauens, would not so much as once haue gone about or imagined, but also now (contra∣rie) to all humanitie, reuilest me with such oprobrious
<PB REF="16"/> spéeches, whom héeretofore thou durst not to looke me in the face for feare, and also reuile at her, whom neither thy selfe, nor no man liuing is able to touch with y<SUP>t</SUP> least crime whatsoeuer, and that would I make good against shée, and thrée of the best of thy Knights with my body, were I at li∣bertie, hauing horse and armor. Tis true, tis true, replied the Duke, we knowe your vallor to be great, but we will soone abate that your hote courage, and place you where your Goddesse whom you so much estéeme, shall neither haue power, nor meanes to helpe you.</P>
<P>Doe thy worst replied the King, and sith it is the will of God to inflict this punishment vpon me, I will indeuor my selfe with patience, to indure what torments soe∣uer shall happen, hoping in the world to come, to inioy therefore eternall blessednesse: but in y<SUP>e</SUP> meane time thinke not thou, but that thou maist fall in like mishap, and that I haue yet remaining in the Kingdome of Denmarke such Subiects, that when they shall knowe of this my ill for∣tune and thy crueltie, will not leaue bearing Armes, till such time they shal haue layd wast, this thy accursed Coun∣try, not leauing thée any Towne, or Fort to hide thy selfe, from their reuengefull swords: wherefore aduise thee, and determine either to set me at libertie, or otherwise expect those euils, which will surely fall on thy Country. If thou consent to my inlargement, for my ransome thou shalt re∣ceaue a whole million of gold, which shall bee payed thée foorthwith out of my treasurie.</P>
<P>No, no, replied <HI>Griffory,</HI> thy gold is but drosse, and can∣not worke in me that content, which my hart shall inioy by thy imprisonment, neither doe I feare thy power which thou so much vauntest of, for thou shalt sée, and that short∣ly, that I will not onely possesse my selfe of thy darlings County of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> but also by the strength of this right arme, in despight of all thy power, Crowne my selfe King of the Kingdome of <HI>Danske,</HI> whilst thou in the meane time, shall lie rotting thy bones in my prison. Thē turning about to a Knight of his, named Sir <HI>Ragdand,</HI> hee willed
<PB REF="16"/> him to conuay the vnhappie King prisoner vnto his Castle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> and there to put him into the dungion of the sayd Castle, and to alowe him euery day, for the continu∣ance of his most wretched life, a quart of water, and a∣pound of bread, made of the coursest branne, thinking this, that continually pining away by reason of his course faire, would be a farre greater paine and torment vnto him, then any present death whatsoeuer. Likewise for the more sure keeping of him, hee ordained a gard of fifty Knights, al∣waies to bee within the Castle, who should sée that no Knight should enter therein. This Castle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> was of meruailous strength, inuironed about with déepe ditches, and mighty heigh walls, and had but only one way in, which was ouer a drawe bridge, the which was alwaies defended by ten of the sayd fifty Knights, fiue at y<SUP>e</SUP> one end, and fiue at the other, this gard grew at length to a custome, by reason of the hundred Knights of Denmarke, which went in search of their King, and was deuised only to in∣trap and imprison them, as you may reade towards the latter end of this booke. Héere now will we leaue the woful King inclosed in a miserable prison, bewailing his crosse fortune, where hee passed away many a yeare, &amp; although his fare was as we haue sayd before both course and short, yet did God so blesse him, that he continued alwaies heal∣thy and stronge of body, neuer grieued with any kind of sicknes, sauing onely discontentednesse of minde, which with patience he much delayed, &amp; returne we to speake of <HI>Martinus,</HI> (who had not long after the imprisonment of the King, quietly inioyed the cittie of <HI>Hanstance,</HI> withall the profits thereof before granted him, to the extreame griefe of the chiefest of the Cittie, who disdained much to bee in subiection to so base a person,) for the Duke, some eight daies after possession deliuered, fell in consideration with himselfe, of the great benefit which hee had lost, by giuing away the chiefe Citty in his Dukedome, deuised which way he might with his honor recouer the same againe: at length hauing resolued with himselfe, he brought it thus to
<PB REF="17"/> passe.</P>
<P>One day béeing with diuers of his Nobility, and <HI>Mar∣tinus</HI> béeing in company, the Duke fained himselfe to be ve∣ry merry, and in his mirth, for his further content, desired <HI>Martinus</HI> to declare, how hee hapned to take <HI>Frederick</HI> pri∣soner. <HI>Martinus</HI> not distrusting any thing, began to make a large repetition, beginning with his former life in France, then the cause and manner of his banishment, and their a∣riuing in Denmarke, with their robbery and murder, com∣mitted in the Forrest of <HI>Maiance,</HI> with their cruell storme sustained at Sea, as is before declared, by which they were put on that Coast, and lastly, the profer of a hundred thou∣sand pound by the King, which hee refused, onely to plea∣sure the Duke. All which when <HI>Griffory</HI> had attentiuelie listned vnto, hée suddenly start vp from the place where hée sate, commaunding the standers by to lay hands on <HI>Marti∣nus,</HI> saying that it was not lawfull to suffer such a one, who had so many waies deserued death, as by his owne confes∣sion did appeare, neither to liue, nor to be accepted into the societie of men: wherefore he willed thē forth-with to leade him to the place of execution. Which when <HI>Martinus</HI> per∣ceiued, and saw that the Tyrant was fully minded to exe∣cute, whatsoeuer he had said, hee fell downe on his knees, desiring mercy, and offering for the safegard of his life, to redeliuer his right of the Citty of <HI>Hanstance.</HI> But hee who neuer was acquainted with mercy or compassion, doubt∣ting if he should pardon him his life, the whole world would condemne him of iniustice: and séeing he might as well by his death as his life inioy his will, aunswered, that by the Law hee had deserued to die, and hee béeing appointed by God, to be a minister of iustice, could doo no lesse then cause the lawes to be executed: wherefore for an example to all others who for the desire of this worldly gaine, are content to betray the innocent, hee was ledde to the market place, and had his head smitten of. Now will we returne to speak of the Quéene and her young sonne, whom wee left in the Forrest, beeing accompanied with brute beasts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Howe the Queene going into the Forrest, lost her young sonne, for whom shee made great lamentation, and how he was found, and carried away by the Duke of Saxony.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OV remember, how the Quéene and her little sonne, béeing still in the Caue, were nourished by such meate as the Lyon vsed to bring them: and many times for her recreation, would goe walke amongst the trées néere adioyning to their Caue. Thus continued shée by the space of one whole yéere, neuer séeing other company then the wilde beasts: although there were diuers searches made through the Forrest, as well by the Knights that west in the quest of her and the King, as also by others for diuers occasions. It hapned one day that the Lion hauing brought in a young Kidde, which hée had ta∣ken, the Quéene went forth to breake some wood to rost the same withall: and taking her young sonne with her, who by this time was able a little to goe and craule, and setting him downe in the sunne whilst she went vp and downe, to breake rotten bowes and sticks for the vse aforesaid, think∣ing her childe would continue quiet enough, playing with such toyes as she had left him, went somewhat farre from the place. Hée in the meane time, either béeing wearie of his sport, or disliking the place where he was, or more like∣ly by the speciall will of God, who pittying his and others mishaps, had otherwise determined of his bringing vp, cau∣sed him to goe from place to place: so that by the time his Mother had prouided her wood, and was come to the place shée left him in, he was gone astray cleane out of hearing. Which when she beheld, and had awhile called and sought after him, not knowing what was become of him, a thou∣sand imaginations came into her mind: sometimes think∣ing some wilde beasts had deuoured him, then imagining againe, that the Lyon séeing him in that place by himselfe,
<PB REF="18"/> had carried him to the Caue, as oftentimes hee would be playing with him, and beare him from place to place: and béeing a little comforted with this hope, shee hasted her to the Caue, where likewise shee was deceiued of her hope, which put her into such griefe, that not béeing able to con∣taine herselfe on her féete, shée fell into a traunce. Where wee will leaue her awhile, and declare what became of the child. You shall vnderstand, that the very same day, <HI>Mau∣ris</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> passing y<SUP>e</SUP> Seas from <HI>England</HI> towards his owne Country, was driuen by force of weather vppon this Coast, where béeing safely arriued, with a few shyps of his Nauie, the rest béeing disperst with the storme, and béeing weary of the Sea, determined with some twentie or thirtie Knights, and Gentlemen in his companie, to take some recreation and pastime in the Forrest, which was hard adioyning vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> sea-side where his ships then rode, as is declared in the first chapter of this Booke. So taking their horses and Armour, for feare of any danger which might happen, they altogether set foorth into the Forrest, whereas they had not long rode, before such time as a mer∣uailous great Stagge appeared vnto them, which when Duke <HI>Mauris</HI> beheld, with his Launce in his hand, hee set spurres to his horse, willing the rest of his company to fol∣low him, hoping by the swiftnes of his horse to haue slaine the Stagge: which hee pursued so farre, that at length hee had lost the sight of all his company, and was entred so far in the Forrest, that hée knew not well which way to re∣turne againe, so thicke were the trées and bushes, and so many the small trodden paths which ledde two and fro, made by the wilde beasts.</P>
<P>Thus roming to and fro, fearing to loose himselfe, and hoping to finde his companie, at length hee passed by the place, where as the young child had gotten himselfe by his crauling, whilst his Mother was gathering sticks (euen a∣bout the time that she good Lady was returned to the Caue to seeke for him) which when Duke <HI>Mauris</HI> beheld, hee a∣lighted downe from his horse, and séeing it to be so fayre
<PB REF="18"/> and no bodie nere it, hee mused from whence it should come, or by what meanes it might be brought into a place, so desert and voyd of humane companie: then taking the childe vp in his armes, and earnestly beholding it, hee thought that it did very much resemble his young sonne lago, who was then about the age of <HI>18</HI> or <HI>20</HI> monthes old, wherefore after hee had a while called to sée, whether any body would come to séeke for the child, and sawe that none came, he mounted againe on horse backe, taking the childe with him, determining to haue him nourished &amp; brought vp with his sonne, because they did so much resemble and were so néere of age, imagining that it might bee some Gentlemans, or Nobles mans childe, that by some great misfortune was brought into this extremitie, thus some∣times musing of one matter, and so of another, he rod on∣wards he knew not well whether, but by chance he hapned on a small beaten way, which brought him out of the For∣rest, almost at the same place where he entred, where hée found all his companie in a great feare, and doubt what was become of him, minding to haue returned againe into the Forrest to séeke for him. But when they sawe him com∣ming, they were all filled with great ioy, &amp; went to méete him, to whom he recounted all his aduenture, and of the finding of the childe, which when they had heard, and be∣held him, they much admired as well his strange finding, as also the rarenesse of his beautie, then which they imagi∣ned neuer to haue séene any more accomplished: some ima∣gining this, some that, and all they knew not what, this past they away the time vntill they were come, where their shippes ancored, and going aboord the next day, ha∣uing the wind faire, and the seas indifferently calme, they set saile in so happie a houre, that within foure daies after they arriued in the Dutchie of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> at a port called <HI>Le∣ton,</HI> from whence they rode towards the Cittie of <HI>Bren∣sweke,</HI> where then the Dutches was remaining, of whom and the whole Cittie, the Duke was most louingly recea∣ued, and welcomed home, who presently after his comming
<PB REF="19"/> to the Pallace, he demaunded for his young sonne, who be∣ing brought before him, he caused likewise the childe which he found in the Forrest to be brought also, who being both together, a man might very hardly knowe the one from the other, but that the <HI>Saxon</HI> Prince, was something the bigger, as being elder by sixe monthes, hand had also as then somewhat the better cullor, being norished with more wholsomer diet. After they had a while beheld and played with the children, the Duke declared vnto the Dutches, and rest of the Lords and Ladies there present, the man∣ner of his finding, as before is recited, and likewise willed to haue him brought vp, as acompanion with his sonne, desiring the Dutches to bee as carefull of him, as of her owne, assuring her that his minde gaue him, how that the childe was issued of a Noble bloode: &amp; because they knewe not by what name to call him, the Duke willed him to bée called the Gentleman of the Forrest, which name we must vse vntill such time, as fortune shall make knowne, from whence he is procéeded. Héere againe will wee leaue him, and returne to speake of the Quéene his mother, whom we left in a traunce in the Caue, where hauing line a long while, and at length come vnto herselfe againe, and remembring the losse of her childe, fell to wéeping, and renting, and tearing her face with her nailes, pulling her haire from her head, and cursing herselfe which had taken no better care of him: then comming foorth of the Caue, she went crying vp and downe, causing the woods to resound the eccho of her son, séeking whether shee could in any place perceaue, either by bloud or other signe, if he were deuou∣red of the wild beasts, and finding none, she fell againe to séeke in euery bush, if happily hee might be crept therein, but all in vaine bestowed she her paines good Lady, to séeke for him which in that place could not bee found, for God had otherwise ordained, for the bringing vp of the child, as you haue already heard, though vnknowne to the good La∣die his mother, who was now in such extreame griefe, not finding nor knowing what was become of her childe, that
<PB REF="19"/> she became as franticke, wéeping, &amp; crying, vp and downe the Forrest all that day, and most part of the night, till be∣ing forced with wearinesse she sat downe, and rested her∣selfe. Where sitting a while, and contemplating her sor∣rowes, one whiles there would come into her minde, the remembrance of her husband, and her former estate, being in ioy and prosperitie, the calling to minde whereof, did strike into her the greater sorrowe: for being in miserie, there is no greater griefe, then to call to minde forepassed pleasures: then againe, would come into her minde her vision, which she sawe in the Forrest, and the hope of fu∣ture ioyes, which thereby was promised, which did some∣what againe mittigate her sorrowe, thus passed shee away all that night, in weeping and lamentations, neither caring nor thinking what might become of her, so excessiue was her griefe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. How the Queene the next day got out of the Forrest, and how she placed herselfe in a Monestrie, neere to the Citty of Maiance.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE night béeing past, and beautifull <HI>Aurora</HI> comming againe to the viewe of this hether worlde, whose welcome the chéerefull Birds rang forth, with many a pleasant tune, to the comfort of all earth∣ly creatures: the wofull Lady, who of all the night had not once suffred her eyelids to close, nor giuen nature her due by fléepe, rising vp from the place where she had remained all night, began againe to renew her former sorrow, sometimes cursing &amp; raging at her euill fortune, then againe blaming herselfe for her impatience, which was not able to indure those crosses which God for her tryall had layd vpon her.</P>
<P>Thus at length somewhat comforted with the hope shee had, that the prouidence of the most Highest, might turne
<PB REF="20"/> all her afflictions and crosses, into ioyes and blessings, and likewise that in time, she might recouer, according to the Vision which she had séene at her first comming into y<SUP>e</SUP> for∣rest, both her husband and sonne, shée determined to make triall if she might get forth of the Forrest which if she could; she would vnknowne trauell vnto some Monestary, or re∣ligious house, where shée meant to spend y<SUP>e</SUP> rest of her time to her soules comfort: but first she determined to make tri∣all if her husband were returned or not. So hapning on a by path, onwards she went so farre, that by the time that <HI>Phoebus</HI> golden Chariot was ascended into the midle hea∣uens, shee found herselfe euen at the place, where first in company of the King, and theyr traine of Lords &amp; Ladies, shée entred the wood, at such time as they were set on by the Out-lawes. Where beholding the place, and calling to minde that there beganne the head and well-spring of all her troubles, and miseries which shée had since that time indured, brake foorth into these, or such like spéeches.</P>
<P>O thou accursed place, reserued onely of the diuine pow∣ers to be a plague and hell to those, who willingly not so much as in thought offended against them. I beséech the Almightie protector of heauen and earth, that thou mayest for euer-more prooue barren and vnfruitfull, and that these thy goodly trées and bushes, which were a couert vnto those damned wretches, which seperated me from that péerlesse Prince and my déere loue, may héereafter neuer beare nei∣ther fruite nor leaues, but may presently wither away and die: as did that figge trée which thou, O Sauiour Christ, diddest curse for not yéelding of fruite in y<SUP>e</SUP> time of thy hun∣ger, going frō <HI>Bethania</HI> to <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Thus accursing that place, and the whole Forrest, shee directed her course to∣wards <HI>Maiance,</HI> where by reason of her long absence, and the altering of her apparrell, through time &amp; her best skill, shée entred vnknowne of any, where shee found such an al∣teration, that she could scarcely belieue that to be the Citty, which in former time shée had séene so much to florish, in costly and braue shewes: and not knowing well what to
<PB REF="20"/> imagin, shée secretlie inquired as well the cause of this strange alteration, as also whether there were any certain newes of the Kings being aliue or dead. All which at large was declared vnto her, as well the cause of sorrow, which generally did appeare through all the Cittie, for the losse of the King, as also the new gouernment of the state, which was disliked of many: but whether the King were liuing or no, that was not knowne, so secretly did that Tyrant <HI>Griffory</HI> cause his imprisonment to be conceald.</P>
<P>But at length, hauing made what inquirie she could, not minding to make her selfe knowne, she returned againe out of the Citty, and went vnto a Monestary some three miles distant, called the Monestry of our Lady, where comming to the Gouernesse, she intreated to be entertained amongst the Religious Votaries. Affirming herselfe to be a poore desolate widdow, who béeing by death dispoyled of all cō∣fort, had determined to end the remnant of her life in pray∣er, and thanksgiuing vnto her Creator, trusting thereby to find comfort for her soule in the world to come. The Ab∣besse béeing a very deuout and religious woman, marking not onely her outward gesture, which was a plaine demon∣stration of inward griefe, but also considering her rare beu∣tie, which though it were not set foorth by any Art or abili∣ments, yet in that carelesse and couert sort, did it appeare to be most singuler, demaunded of her many questions, which she answered in such good and modest sort, that shée grew thereby in great liking, and good opinion of her, en∣tertaining her amongst the rest of her Sisters, where shee behaued herselfe in such good sort, that in short time she gai∣ned to herselfe, not onely the loue of all the house, but also the fame of her godly liuing, was spredde abroade through all the country adioyning, to the great commendation, and famousing of the Monestry.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. How the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>He∣nault,</HI> with diuers others, were deuided by a strange ad∣uenture: and what hapned vnto the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> there∣by.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is to be remembred before, how the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>He∣nault,</HI> with diuers others, taking on them the search of their King, began their iourney from <HI>Maiance,</HI> resoluing not to returne with out some certaine newes of him whō they sought for: thus trauailing on together through most part of <HI>Denmark,</HI> they hapned at length cōming into a Forrest, to méet a Squire on horsback, making all the spéede that possibly he might: euer looking backwards, as if some body had pursued him. At length, méeting with the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and the rest of the company, who were in all to the number of twelue Knights, besides their Squires, and thinking by the costly Armor which he ware, him to be the chiefest in the compa∣nie, alighted from his horse, and falling on his knées, with the teares standing in his eyes, spake as followeth.</P>
<P>Most curteous Knight, for so much my minde assureth you to be, I humbly beséech you, and the rest of your com∣pany heere present, for the honour of knight-hood, and the loue that you ought to beare to all distressed Ladies and Damsels, that you wil doe so much as succour and reuenge a most beautifull Lady, who euen now in this Forrest bée∣ing trauailing to a brothers house of hers, some 3. leagues distance from her owne, béeing accompanied with her hus∣band, my Lord and Maister, and some foure or fiue atten∣dants more, whom I feare mee by this time are all neere∣hand slaine, or grieuously wounded, by a ranck Traytor, who hauing long time sued vnto my Lady for lasciuious loue, and not béeing able to maintaine the same, by reason of her chast and honest denials: this morning, knowing
<PB REF="21"/> that she was to passe this way, accompanied himselfe with some tenne or twelue, as wickedly disposed as himselfe, whom hee had made acquainted with his villainous pre∣tence, vnawares set vppon vs, &amp; at the first incounter grie∣uously wounded my Lord, by reason he was vnarmed, ha∣uing nothing but his sword to defend himselfe, as not dou∣ting any such euill.</P>
<P>Thus concluding his tale with whole floods of teares, which issued from his sorrowfull eyes, which mooued pitty in all the beholders, especially in the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> who not long before had tasted the like mishap: willing y<SUP>e</SUP> squire to stand vp, and comfort himselfe, assuring him, that he had met with those, who would reuenge the wrong which hee had declared vnto them. Wherefore willing him to shewe which way he should take, he set spurres to his horse, and galloped as fast as hee could, hoping to come soone enough to their succour: which when the rest of his companie be∣held, they followed after as fast as they could, but had not rodden long before they had lost sight of him, by reason of the thicknesse of the wood, and the swiftnes of his horse, which was accounted to be the best in all the Kingdome. Thus galloping onwards, at length he came where y<SUP>e</SUP> way deuided it selfe into thrée seuerall paths, and taking that on the right hand, as thinking it to be the right way, hee rode on still, neuer looking backe for his cōpany, so earnest was his mind, set on the rescue of the Lady and her husband. The rest comming after, when they came vnto the place where the way deuided it selfe, knew not well what to doe, nor which way to take, yet at length, béeing directed by the Squire, the most of them, as Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> tooke that way which ledde directly foorth betwéen the other two, appointing some to take the other wayes to follow the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> if peraduenture he had missed in his way. Amongst which his Squire, &amp; two other Knights, the one named Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> the other Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> tooke the way which he before had roden.</P>
<P>The Lorde <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> as wee haue said before, beeing
<PB REF="22"/> pricked on with a desire to rescue those which were distres∣sed, made such hast, that after he had passed the place where the wayes deuided it selfe, and hauing rodden about two miles from the place, met with a peasant driuing of cattell before him, of whom he inquired, whether he had séene any company thereabouts fighting? or any Knights or gentle∣men slaine? The peasant made aunswere he saw no such, but some halfe a mile before, he met foure Knights crossing the way towards a little Castle, some two leagues of, lea∣ding a very faire Lady pittifully wéeping, whō he thought they constrained to goe onwards against her will. When <HI>Gwaltero</HI> had heard this, he assured himselfe that this was the same Lady whom he went to rescue, wherefore deman∣ding which way they went, the peasant shewed him where they were riding vp a little hill, almost a mile before him, which when he beheld, he spurred on faster then before hée had doone, so that before they were attained vnto the sight of theyr Castle, he had ouertaken them in a fayre meddow, betwéene two small hills. And calling to them, sayd, Tray∣tors turne, and deliuer me that Lady, whom so villainously you haue carried away, or your liues shall pay my sworde her raunsome.</P>
<P>They hearing him call, and looking backe, séeing but one Knight alone persuing them, stayed, and he who ledde the Ladies horse by the raines, being a very bigge and comly Knight, answered: foolish and most simple Knight, thinkest thou me so fond or faint harted, that only at thy threats, who art able to performe nothing but in words, I will de∣liuer this my prize whom I haue gotten so hardly, and with the price of much bloud, or that my loue towards her is so small, so lightly to part from her. No, no, I counsell thée rather for thy owne safegard to depart away, or else this my Launce shall make your passe-port to old <HI>Caron. Gwaltero</HI> hearing this, and being no longer able to indure those braues, placed his Launce in his rest, and setting spurres to his horse, they ranne together like lightning, and at the encounter their speares slew into y<SUP>e</SUP> aire, <HI>Gwal∣tero</HI>
<PB REF="22"/> passing on without any hurt at all, but the other Knight whose name was <HI>Brandoll,</HI> being wounded a little in the left side, was so sore astonied with the stroke, that he could hardly containe himselfe, from falling from his horse: which <HI>Gwaltero</HI> perceauing, his carreare ended, re∣turned againe with his sword in his hand, then méeting the one the other, there beganne a fierce and doubtfull com∣bat, which had foorthwith ended by a stroke that the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> gaue him on the right shoulder, which was so mighty, that breaking his pouldron, wounded him shrewdly in the shoulder, and sliding downe farther, cut him into the thigh, with paine whereof hée fell from his horse: which when the rest of his companie beheld, all at once they assailed him, charging him so roughly, that hée was likely to haue gone besides his Saddle, had he not ta∣ken hold on the horse maine with his hands, but they had no great cause long to boast thereof, for gathering all his forces together, and raysing himselfe in his stirrup, hée tooke one of them so sound a blow on the Helme, that the stéele not able to kéepe out the stroke, claue his head to the téeth, to the great discomfort of the rest.

One of them whose Launce remained whole, determined to charge him on the backe, and comming be∣hind him with his full carreare, at such a time as he was raising himselfe in his stirrups, to haue striken one that was before him, gaue him such a cruell stroke, that caused him tumble headlong ouer his horse necke, and had not his Armor beene excéeding good, that blowe had made an end of the combat: but hee who was reserued for other pur∣poses, féeling himselfe so cowardly striken, quickly recoue∣red his féete, and defended himselfe valiently, though with more disaduantage then before, whereby he receaued
<PB REF="23"/> many wounds, and was likely to haue béene ouercome, for by this time <HI>Brandoll</HI> had againe recouered his scences, and séeing the Knight who had brought him into that case, to continue still fighting, against his Knights, and had al∣ready slaine one of them, being vrged forwards, both with shame and griefe, taking his sword in his hand, hée ranne vpon him like a fierce vnskilfull mastiue, who being once tossed by the sturdie bull, commeth on more hastily then before: but <HI>Gwaltero</HI> perceauing him comming, séeming to méete him lightly, made a thrust at one of the Knights horses, which charged him on horse-backe, which thrust lighted so luckily, that so piercing his belly, hee caused him with his Maister to tumble to the ground, where by reason of one of his féete being in the stirrup, he could not so sud∣denly rise againe, by which meanes <HI>Gwaltero</HI> the more nasier delt with <HI>Brandoll,</HI> and the other Knight, who séeing his fellowes mischance, dismounted himselfe for feare of the like mishap: now grew the foote combat more hote and fierce then that on horse-backe, by reason that <HI>Gwaltero</HI> perceauing himselfe almost wearied, and fearing the com∣ming of the other Knight, whose foote was in the stirrup vnder his horse, layd on with al his might, but <HI>Brandoll</HI> be∣ing a strong Knight as most in that Country, séemed to set light by his furie, and charged him againe with so ma∣ny mighty blowes, as well hee gaue him to vnderstand, that he knew better how to fight on foote, then on horse-backe.</P>
<P>The good Lady in the meane time sate wéeping on her palfrie, being held by two of <HI>Brandolls</HI> Squiers, euer praying and beseeching God, to preserue and defend the strange Knight, whose vertue and prowesse she much ad∣mired, and whom she feared was not long able to indure the brunt of the battaile, for that the other Knight hauing recouered himselfe from vnder his horse, came likewise to to the combat, to her great griefe and sorrowe. But casting away her head from the sight of the battaile, as loth to sée the death of him, who had so valiantly fought in her de∣fence,
<PB REF="23"/> she espied two Knights with a Squire, come gallo∣ping as fast as their horses could runne, whom shee like∣wise feared to be some of <HI>Brandolls</HI> companie, but therein she was deceaued as you shall heare in the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. How Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> and Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Gwalteros</HI> Squire came to his rescue, and how they conducted the Lady to her Castle.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR <HI>Brewes,</HI> and Sir <HI>Cadrus</HI> the two Knights, which tooke the way after the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> accompanied with his Squire, thinking because he had taken the wrong way, that hee should haue had no occasion of fighting, made the lesser spéede after him, vntil such time, that comming vnto the top of the hill which he had passed, where the peasant showed him the foure Knights that ledde away the Lady, from which place they beheld them fighting, and thinking that it might be <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> they set spurres to their horses, and galloped so fast, that they were come within the calling, euen as the Knight who was hanging by the stirrupe had recouered himselfe. Then Sir <HI>Cadrus</HI> cryed to the sayd villaines, giue ouer fighting with that alone Knight, and defend your selues from the force of my Launce, and there with gaue one of them so sound a buffet, that he had no néede at all to séeke for a Surgion, for his Launce entring in at his brest, passed through his hart almost a yeard. Sir <HI>Brewes</HI> ranne at the other and missed course, but turning againe with his sword in his hand, gaue him such a blowe on the head, that cleauing his Helme, and wounding him some∣what déepe, caused him halfe astonied to fall to the ground. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> séeing this vnexpected ayde, béeing almost be∣fore in vtter dispayre of victory, gaue <HI>Brandoll</HI> a sore blow on the right legge, and closing with him, by cleane force o∣uerthrew him to the ground, then setting his foote on his
<PB REF="24"/> necke, he rased of his Helme, and with one blow parted his head from his shoulders. And comming to the other whom Sir <HI>Brewes</HI> had wounded, would haue doone as much for him, but that hee immediatly fell on his knées, crying for mercy, protesting for euer after to be at his commaund in all places whatsoeuer. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> vppon this his promise, granted him pardon, swearing him for euer after, not to of∣fer wrong nor violence, to any Lady or Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>Then turning to Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> and Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> hee gaue them hartie thanks for their succour, without which he had béene doubtlesse slaine. Demaunding of them likewise, what was become of the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the rest. And they told him how they parted at the 3. waies, to goe succour the Lady whom hee had so well rescued, tel∣ling him likewise, that they did admire how or by what meanes the Lady was brought thether, seeing it was in the other way that ledde directly forward that they set on her and her husband, as the Squire informed them.</P>
<P>By this time the Lady being let goe by the two Squiers that held her, (who séeing their Maister slaine, made hast by flight to saue their owne liues, which they might easily doe, for that no man pursued them,) came vnto the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and falling on her knées before him, gaue him most humble thankes, as well for the safegard of her owne honor, which shée estéemed farre afore life, as also for re∣uenging her husbands death: whom <HI>Brandoll</HI> in the for∣mer fight had slaine, with some two or thrée of their ser∣uaunts, who put themselues in their defence, with all, of∣fering him many large proffers for reward. But <HI>Gwaltero</HI> taking her by the hand, raised her from the ground, wil∣ling her to be of good comfort, assuring her whatsoeuer hée had doone for her, was but his, and the dutie of euery good Knight, and therefore willed her to attribute it, not to him but to God, who is the reuenger of all wrongs: and to ac∣count of him but as an instrument, appointed by God to minister iustice on those murderers. Then the Ladie en∣treated him and the rest, to conduct her vnto a Castle of
<PB REF="24"/> hers, some two leagues of, where she would intreate them to rest themselues, vntill such time as his woundes were throughly cured, which should be doone by a damsell of hers, very expert in the Art of Surgery. Vnto which re∣quest, they easily consented, especially the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> whose hart was already wounded with the Ladies beutie. Then binding vp his wounds as well as they could, they mounted on horsebacke, directing their course towards the foresaid Castle, &amp; the better to passe away the time, <HI>Gwal∣tero</HI> beganne to question with the Lady of many matters, especially of the cause of the late combat, which shee decla∣red vnto him, with such a modest and comlie grace, that hée béeing before a little wounded with <HI>Cupids</HI> shaft, was now so altogether ouercome with loue, that either he must néedes sue for grace, or die by concealing his affection: so feruent was the flame, and so weake his resistance.</P>
<P>By this time were they passed most part of theyr way, and were come vnto the Castle, euen about the time, that the Sunne drawing into the West, séemed to take leaue of the view of these hether Regions, where by the Lady they were most kindly receiued: and welcommed with such chéere, as the suddennes of the time could affoord. After Supper, the Lorde <HI>Gwaltero</HI> béeing brought into a most goodly and fayre Chamber, had his wounds carefully loo∣ked vnto, and dressed. Then beeing layd in a ritch bedde, imbrodred very costly with gold and pearle, and curiously wrought with imagry, and other sumptuous shewes, where beeing layd, the good Lady curteously bad him good night, willing him to commaund for all things in the Ca∣stle as his owne. Then departing away, leauing him in a world of imaginations, shée tooke order for the interring of her Husbands bodie, which the next day was effected with great solemnitie, according to the custome of the coun∣try then vsed.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> and his company, stay∣ing the curing of his wounds, which were most carefully looked vnto, and dressed by the same Damsell which had them in cure, was euery day visited continually by y<SUP>e</SUP> La∣die of the place, who shewed herselfe so thankfull vnto him, that she almost neuer would depart frō his presence, which bred in him such ardent desire, that not béeing able longer to conceale his loue, one day shée béeing sitting by his bed∣side, none béeing in presence, but his Squire, and the dam∣sell that attended his wounds, taking her by the hand, and fixing his eyes stedfastly on her face, said.</P>
<P>Gracious Lady, I doe not knowe, nether can I imma∣gine, how these my speeches, which at this time I shall bée forced to vetter, may be by you accepted, yet trusting in the gentlenesse of your kind nature, haue made choise ra∣ther to open my griefe vnto you, then by concealing there∣of, or euer to languish in paine. Know then, that since the first time it was my hap (when I fought with <HI>Brandoll</HI> and his companie) for to see you, that then your rare and singular beauty, wounded me more farre deeper, then did either their swords or Launces, which since by your con∣tinuall courtisies, and by your many exquisite vertues, which I haue behold in you, are so much augmented and increased, that vnlesse you of your excellent bounty, take pitty and compassion on me, and with spéede yeeld some reliefe, vnto this my oppressed passions, I knowe not what to expect saue death onely, which if you should prooue pit∣tilesse, it would be most welcome vnto me: wherefore let me intreate you, to consider these my passions, and to ease them with pitty, and thereby shall you gaine vnto your
<PB REF="25"/> selfe for euer, a true Knight, and a constant louer. Thus concluding his speech with a most déepe sigh, procéeding from the bottome of his hart, he remained silent, attending her answere, which should be to him either as life or death, to which she replied.</P>
<P>My Lord, I cānot but muse at this your discourse, neither can I chuse but smile, to sée your honor so merrily disposed, to iest at me in this kind of sort, hoping that mirth is a signe of y<SUP>e</SUP> amendment of your wounds, which to me would bee most ioyfull, séeing that in my defence you receaued them. But if these your spéeches procéede from you in ear∣nest, knowe then, that the beauty which you say hath in∣flamed you, in my conceit is of no such force, as to wound a man of your worth, neither is it likely that so sudden a liking as you speake of, should bee able to work any such effect, if my curtesies haue béene the cause, they were neuer more then you deserued, and therefore to be estéemed by you as a debt due from mee to be payd: if my vertues which you speake of, they alas are so fewe, and small, that they are not to be accounted of, but yet such I hope, which ra∣ther should giue you an occasion, to séeke to others, then any show to yeild vnto your lawlesse loue: for know for a suerty y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Menea,</HI> for so was she called, regardeth more her honor &amp; good name, then she doth all the riches or wealth of this world, knowing the one to be but momentarie, the other perpetuall: wherefore I beséech your honor to giue of these vaine sutes. But if you séeke to inioy me as your wife, which I thinke you will take scorne of, I being but a poore Lady, and descended but of a meane Parentage, in respect of your Lordship, yet notwithstanding consider I beséech you, the late death of my husband, whom if I should so soone forget, it would for euer be accounted a great ignomie, and shame vnto me.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> at these last spéeches interrupting her, replied, most beautifull Lady, thinke not that I goe a∣bout any way to dishonor you, neither that those my for∣mer speeches to be fained, but whatsoeuer I haue spoken
<PB REF="26"/> to procéede from the sinceritie, and bottome of my harf, which is, and for euer shall remaine yours, whilst the fates shall permit me to inioy this breath, which I wish no lon∣ger to continue, then I remaine your faithfull and constant Knight protesting before the almighty God: neuer to ac∣cept of any other wife, so you thereto consent, in witnesse whereof, I héere deliuer you this ring: then taking a faire Diamond from one of his fingers, he would haue put it on hers, but she withdrawing her hand, made him answere, that shee had made a solemne vowe to God, which shée was minded to performe, which was, that for one whole yeare, shee would neuer consent to marry with any one whatsoeuer, but if it pleased his Lordship, so to estéeme of her, as to accept her for his wife, at the end of that appoin∣ted time which she had set: he should find her most ready &amp; willing to obey vnto his will, in any that might not bée to her dishonor.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> gladded to the hart, with this heauenly conclu∣sion, and beeing as one newly reuiued out of some dead traunce, tooke her in his armes and kissed her, protesting that he would most willingly remaine so contented, vntill the fixed time were expired, and then God willing, he would returne and espouse her: in y<SUP>e</SUP> meane time he intreated her, to accept of that his small Ring, which should be a cause for her to remember him by, which she then most willingly ac∣cepted, and in requitall thereof, gaue vnto him a Iewell of hers, which hee alwaies after either in Tilt or Turnie wore, being fastned in the crest of his Helme, and which at all times put him in minde of his Lady and Mistris. Thus by the comming in of Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> and Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> with diuers Gentlemen and Damsels, which came to sée the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> their loue talke gaue ouer for that time, entertaining the others with diuers pleasant and merrie discourses, wherewith they accustomed to passe a∣way the time, euer thinking it long till they might be in their former quest, which was the sooner, for that <HI>Gwaltero</HI> being comforted, with the hope of future pleasure and con∣tent,
<PB REF="26"/> was healed much the sooner of his wounds, so that within fiftéene daies, hee was able to beare Armor: and finding himselfe indifferent strong, tooke order with the rest of his companie, the next day to depart onwards, on their way towards the confines of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> where they hoped to haue some ioyfull tidings of him whom they sought, or at least waies to méete againe with the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> whom the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> déerely loued. Thus ha∣uing taken order for the preparing of their iourny, the next day they all tooke their leaue of their kind hostis: and <HI>Gwaltero</HI> taking her aside, desired her with the teares stan∣ding in his eyes, to be mindefull of her former promise, as∣suring her, if God did grant him life and liberty, hee would returne against the fixed time by her appointed, to solem∣nize their marriage, in the meane time he would commend her into the protection of the almighty God. But she good Lady, not being able to speake for wéeping, held him about the necke, often kissing him, as one loth so soone to forgoe his companie, yet at the last, séeing no remedie, intreated him to remember her and his promise, vntill which time of his returne, she would spend her daies in prayer, for his safe and prosperous successe.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. How the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> hapned to arriue in the Cittie of <HI>Parris,</HI> &amp; of the Turnie there proclaimed by the Duke of <HI>Orleance.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> ta∣king the direct way which they were infor∣med, to rescue the Lady, and her husband, rode on a great pace, till such time that com∣ming vnto the place, where the battaile had béene fought but a little before, found y<SUP>e</SUP> dead bodies of the auncient Knight, and diuers of his ser∣uants:
<PB REF="27"/> but for the murtherers, they could not knowe what was become of them, because they had taken a bie and vn∣knowne way, which ledde them as before is sayd, vnto their destruction. Wherefore taking their way towards the next Towne, they rode on hastily, minding to stay there vntill they might heare some newes of the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> whom they imagined would likewise arriue there, the next day at the farthest. But héereof being de∣ceaued by reason of the occasions before recited, after they had remained there some thrée daies looking for him, they departed towards the Sea-side, and comming to a Towne called <HI>Forefront,</HI> they found diuers Ships bound to seueral coasts, wherfore deuiding their selues, some to one Coun∣try, some into another, the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> being loth to part companie, shipped thēselues for <HI>Fraunce,</HI> hoping there either to find him whom they sought for, or else to purchase fame by their prowesse within that King∣dome: and sooner then in any other might it be obtained, if they showed themselues valerous, by reason of y<SUP>e</SUP> continual turnaments, which were dayly vsed there by the Nobles, and Knights of tha region. And being shipped, and hauing wind at will, they set saile so prosperously, y<SUP>t</SUP> within eight daies after they landed at <HI>Calice:</HI> where they a while stay∣ed, as well to refresh themselues after their comming from the Sea, as also to view the Towne and Country therea∣bouts, and to make inquirie, if peraduenture they might heare of him, in whose Quest they went.</P>
<P>Thus hauing stayd there twelue or fourtéene daies, not learning any newes at all of their infortunate King, they tooke their way towards the royall Cittie of <HI>Paris,</HI> where the King then kept his Court, with a great assemblie of Lords and Ladies, which were then drawne together to behold a great Turny, proclaimed by the Duke of <HI>Orle∣ance,</HI> by the Kings consent, against all strangers: the occa∣sion of which Turny grew by this meanes. The Duke béeing a lustie young Knight, was inamoured on y<SUP>e</SUP> Kings eldest daughter, a most beautifull and goodly Lady, who
<PB REF="27"/> for her grace, vertues, and beautie, had not her equall in all the kingdome of Fraunce, beeing called <HI>Emilia,</HI> whose perfections had so intangled his hart, that hee could not by any meanes frée himselfe from béeing thrall to her beautie: and thinking no meanes better to winne a fayre Lady, then by shewing himselfe valiant, hee continually frequented Tylts and Turnyes, oftentimes carrying away the chee∣fest prizes of valour: which was a meanes not onely to ob∣taine great loue, and fauour of the King, but also drew to him some liking of his Lady and Mistris, the Princes <HI>E∣milia,</HI> which she sometimes would make shewe of, by her kind countenaunce, and pleasant spéeches to him: which curtesies put him in such an excéeding hope, and pride with∣all, that thinking himselfe halfe sure of her loue, and that béeing grast with the same, no man was able to compare with him, neither in happines nor valour: one day percei∣uing the King to be walking alone, in a pleasant &amp; delight∣full Garden, adioyning to the Pallace, came vnto him, and falling into some conference with him, at last intreated his Maiestie to grant him leaue to proclaime a Turny, which hee, and some certaine number of Knights of the Court, would defend against all commers, for the space of 3 daies. And that after, by the space of sixe dayes more, hée himselfe would kéepe the field, and defend against all commers, his Mistresse the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> to excell all others in beau∣tie, whatsoeuer.</P>
<P>The King hearing his demaund, and considering the great danger which thereby might happen to him, disswa∣ded him from it, assuring him, that it would be impossible to continue against so many, as would hazard themselues in that enterprise: and that although he by his valor might ouercome many hardie and gallant Knights, yet at length, béeing wearie, &amp; tyred with ouermuch labour, might per∣aduenture be vanquished, by one inferior to those whom before he had subdued, whereby hee should lose his former reputation, gotten with no small perrill and danger. This and many other matters, did the King alleage vnto him,
<PB REF="28"/> to cause him to giue ouer that enterprise. But hee béeing as is before said, so puffed vp with a selfe conceit, &amp; assurance of Fortunes fauour, imagining that on whom <HI>Venus</HI> smi∣led, <HI>Mars</HI> would not séeme to frowne, continued still verie importiue, till at length, the King béeing ouercome by his earnestnesse, granted to his sute. Presently causing He∣raults and messengers to be sent abroade into diuers pla∣ces, to giue notice thereof: that euery one which desired to try his fortune in his Loues commendation, might be there to make triall at the day appointed.</P>
<P>In the meane time, the Duke ordained a place for the Tylt-yard, which was hard adioyning to y<SUP>e</SUP> Pallace, which he caused to be inuironed in with railes of great height, ap∣poynting at each end a large gate or entrance, that tenne Knights on horsebacke might enter in front. The space within the rayles, was of that bignes, so that 5000 knights might well turny togethers, &amp; round about were scaffolds erected for the beholders to sit on, sauing that part next to the Pallace, which was open for the King, the Quéene, and their Lord &amp; Ladies, who standing in the windowes, and battlements of the Pallace, might with more safety behold the Turny. Likewise he caused another place to be inclo∣sed, with onely one gate or entrance, hard adioyning to the part of the Pallace, where the King with the rest, might more conuenietly stand, to behold the single combats which by him should be foughten: and at the other end, he caused a rich Tent to be pight, which was of Blew veluet, sette thicke with starres of gold, and Flowre-deluces, shewing that he was descended from the blood royall. Vpon the top thereof stoode <HI>Cupid,</HI> all naked, with his bow and arrowe in his hand, ayming directly at a faire picture of Marble, which stoode fast by the said Tent: on the top wherof was placed the portrature of the beautifull Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> which was so artificially made, that it séemed to be the prin∣cesse herselfe: vnder whose féete were diuers places made, for placing of their pictures, whose Knights should be ouer come by the Duke.</P>
<PB REF="28"/>
<P>In this sort was all things ordained against the turnie, when the Lord <HI>Menew,</HI> Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and diuers other Knights, came into the Cittie, some two dayes before the Turny began, where they tooke vp their lodging in an ho∣nest Burgesses house, making preparation for such things as they should want against the day.</P>

In the meane time the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Prin∣ces with their companie, were like to haue wonne the day, for that y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>French,</HI> no longer able to indure their extreame blowes, began for to turne their backes: which being per∣ceaued by the Iudges, they foorthwith caused the retreate to be sounded, thereby to saue the Challengers from shame. Then departed euery man the Lists for that night, retur∣ning to their lodgings, to refresh themselues against the next day: the King to showe the more honor vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> strange Princes, sent for them, desiring them for that night, to sup and rest themselues in his Pallace: vnto which many of them cōsented, where at supper they were roially feasted, and welcomed by the King and Quéene. And after the Ta∣bles being with-drawne, they fell to dauncing, masking, and courting of the Ladies and damsels: where the young Prince <HI>Edward</HI> dallying with the fire, was scorched by the flame, for taking the Princes <HI>Emilia</HI> by the hand to daunce, after they had ended their measure, fell to court her with pleasant spéeches, which shee still most wittily answered, which <HI>Cupid</HI> beholding, wounded his hart with a poisoned shaft of loue, turning his iest into earnest: thus past they a∣way most part of the night in dauncing and reuelling, vn∣till such time, that <HI>Ioue</HI> his eternall lampes, wherewith hee
<PB REF="30"/> lights the nether world were halfe spent, and <HI>Atlas</HI> moist daughters stroue into the Ocean déep, to driue their weary droue: then departed these to their beds, where euery one quietly tooke their rest, except the <HI>English</HI> Prince, who of all the night could not inioy any sléepe, so sorely did the re∣membrance of his new loue torment him, sometimes deter∣mining to aske her of her Father, then thinking the Duke to haue a former promise of her, séeing hee vnder∣tooke the defence of her beauty, was minded to fight with him for her, hoping either to kill him, and so to get her, or else by vanquishing him, to winne away her loue. With these and many such like imaginations, past he away the wearisome night, vntill about the breake of the day, <HI>Som∣nus</HI> seased on his ouer-watched eies: so that he slept vntill the sunne was two degrées from the earth ascended, then rising vp hee apparrelled himselfe, and went downe into the great Hall, where he found the King, withall the other Princes and great estates, ready to goe to the Chappell, to heare diuine seruice: whether likewise hee accompaned them, afterwards returning to the Pallace, they found the Tables couered for dinner, where they were all serued ac∣cording to their estates, with most costly and daintie cates. Dinner being ended, euery one went to arme themselues for the Turnie: where the strangers bare themselues so valiently, that they wonne the honor from the Courtiers, which was such an extreame griefe vnto the Duke of <HI>Or∣leance,</HI> that for that night hee would not come to the Pal∣lace, vowing the next day to be reuenged, especially on the <HI>English</HI> Prince and his companie, who twise that day had beaten him from his horse. Most part of the rest spent the time, as they did the night before in dauncing, and such like pastime, where againe the <HI>English</HI> Prince, found meanes to Court his Ladie, declaring vnto her his loue &amp; affection: but she, who as yet was another waies minded, made small account of his prattle, scarce belieuing any thing that he sayd touching loue. The next day the trum∣pets sounding, warned the Knights to prepare for the
<PB REF="30"/> Turnie, euery one desirous to showe himselfe valiant and hardy: when entring the Lists at the first encounter, the <HI>English</HI> Prince séeing the cheefe Challenger comming a∣gainst him, and looking vp to the window where <HI>Emilia</HI> sate, calling to minde his former determinations, was re∣solued to doe him the greatest disgrace he might: the Duke on the other side was of the same opinion, for hee greatly feared least the Prince would prooue his coriuall in loue, by the ofen casting vp of his head to the window where shée sate. Thus being both resolued, they met together so furi∣ously, that the Duke was forced to forgoe his saddle, and measure his length on the grasse, the Prince passing for∣wards sorely shaken, hauing lost both his stirrups: at length recouering himselfe, entred the prease, where on all sides he beate downe Knights, and vnbarred Helmes, making such way where he went, that he might easily be followed of his companie, especially the Prince <HI>Charles, Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Yorke,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mowbray,</HI> and others, who fol∣lowing the young Prince, ouerthrew all they met, cau∣sing the French to giue backe and retire, euery man thin∣king himselfe happiest, when he was farthest of.</P>
<P>On the contrarie side, <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Normandie,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Condie,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Aniow,</HI> and the Marshall: with the aide of their followers, made that part where they were very hote and dangerous to the strangers, vnhorssing and beating downe many. The Duke of <HI>Aniow,</HI> with his Launce before he brake, strake downe thrée Knights to the earth, at last, being incountred by the Lord <HI>Douglasse,</HI> was dismounted and taken prisoner, in dispight of all his company. The Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> being againe remoun∣ted, went raging vp and downe séeking for the <HI>English</HI> Prince, and comming to the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> gaue him such a blow, that hee draue both horse and man to the ground, which being séene by Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> like a man in∣raged rod to him, and gaue him such a blow, that he cau∣sed him to bow his head to his brest. But the Duke reco∣uering
<PB REF="31"/> himselfe, returned him the like payment. Thus con∣tinued they two, laying the one on the other, like two Smithes, striking with their sleadges on an Anuill: till such time as the <HI>English</HI> Prince, with a mace of stéele in his hand returned, &amp; gaue the Duke so puissant a blow there∣with, that breaking his shield in péeces, so amased him, that his horse carried him from place to place in a sound, which being séene by the King, and thinking the Duke to be sore hurt: imagined likewise that it was impossible for any man to indure those mighty blowes, which he continually saw the Prince to giue, caused the Iudges to make an end of the battaile, which was presently doone, euery one attri∣buting the chéefe honor to the <HI>English</HI> Prince, especially the King, causing foorthwith a Herault of Armes to pro∣claime him, the cheefest Knight in the asembly: and being brought to the windowe where y<SUP>e</SUP> King saie, by the Iudges of the field, had a Garland of flowers set vpon his head by the faire <HI>Emilia.</HI> Which as she was doing, vnawares was something touched with loue towards him, which being by her then suffred to kindle, afterwards grew into a great flame. Thus being crowned as King of all Knights, hée was conducted with great honor to the Pallace, the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> being mightily grieued with his disgrace, as also fearing the dislike of <HI>Emilia,</HI> retired to his Tent, min∣ding not to come foorth of the Listes, till such time as hée had recouered some part of his lost honor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. How the Duke defending his Ladies beautie, ouercame di∣uers Knights, &amp; how the English Prince being disguised, entred the Lists.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He next day, no sooner had bright <HI>Aurora</HI> vnbard her christall gates, and bridgrome like stept foorth, the glorious sunne spreading her siluer raies on old <HI>Neptunes</HI> face, but that the lusty Duke prickt on with his for∣mer
<PB REF="31"/> dayes disgrace, hoping to recouer his lost honour, was all armed, sitting on horseback with his Launce in his hand, causing the trumpets to sound, to summon vnto the battel those, who in defence of their Ladies beauties, would hazard thēselues, to try the doubtfull verdit of angry <HI>Mars.</HI> The Duke bare in his shield the portrature of a man, with the one hand renting his owne bowels, and with the other presenting his hart to a fayre Lady, which séemed little to regard or to estéeme the same, with this word or motto written ouer their heads, <HI>I liue through hope:</HI> all the rest of his Armor was set full of flaming harts, which séemed very liuely to burne.</P>
<P>Hee had not long remained on horsebacke, before such time that the King, and most part of the Lords and Prin∣ces, hauing taken their places to behold the issue of his en∣terprise, there entred the listes a gallant young Knight, sonne vnto the Marcus of <HI>Ferara,</HI> his Armor all gréene, and in his Shield he bare two harts combind in one, with these words, <HI>Nil timeo.</HI> Hée brought likewise a small chest coue∣red ouer with thinne plates of siluer, in which was inclo∣sed the liuely portrature of his Lady, who was daughter vnto the Duke of <HI>Millaine.</HI> In this sort comming vnto the Duke, he told him, vnlesse he were misinformed, the con∣tents of his Challenge was, that those Knights that by him were ouercome, should leaue behind them their coate-ar∣mors, and also their Mistrises portrature, to be placed at the féete of the fayre <HI>Emilia,</HI> and so to depart: but whosoeuer should ouercome him, should likewise haue the desposing of the portratures that there were hanging, and to defend the Challenge the rest of the time, except he hapned likewise to be vanquisht. The Duke aunswered, that the same was his Challenge: but the coate-armors were to be put of pre∣sently if they were vnhorsed, and afterwards, if they would hazard the Combat with him, they should. And as for the portratures, hee hoped his should be the first which should be placed, séeing the difference of their beauties did already manifest it.</P>
<PB REF="32"/>
<P>Then departing the one from the other, they placed their Launces in theyr rests, and setting spurres to their horses, they met together so fiercely, that their Speares flew into the ayre: and comming together with their bodies, they strake one the other so rudely, that the Duke lost both his stirrups, and was forced to stay himselfe by his horse neck, but the other was ouerthrowne horse &amp; man to the ground, and by chance not able to cléere himselfe, was sore brused by his horse, not beeing able to get vp againe: then y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke dismounting, holpe to get him from vnder his horse, which curtesie the other perceiuing, presently put off his coate-ar∣mor and departed the Listes, béeing by reason of his bruse not able to combat. Then the Duke caused his Ladies picture to be placed at the féete of <HI>Emilia,</HI> and calling vnto him one of his Pages, sent her the Coate-armor, which she receaued, willing him to tell his Maister, hee had doone more then she desired.</P>
<P>Next vnto him of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> entred the Lists that day, the Lord of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> bringing with him the picture of the Duke of <HI>Poyters</HI> daughter, whom he earnestly loued, and was likewise at the second course vnhorsed, to his great so∣row, but yet not minding to hazard the Combat, because the Duke was accounted the best combatter on foote in all <HI>Fraunce,</HI> departed. After him came diuers others, who were all serued in the same sort, for that day he vnhorsed in all the number of 22. Knights, placing their Ladies Pic∣tures according to their deserts. The next day came into the Listes young <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> very desirous to be re∣uenged, for the disgrace of the Lord <HI>Montgomery</HI> his cosin, yet also bringing with him the picture of a Damsell whom he somewhat loued: but his comming was more to winne honour on the Duke, then to obtaine his Mistrisses fauor. He bare in his Shield, <HI>Paris</HI> and the thrée Goddesses, but giuing the Apple to neither, with this motto, <HI>Cuique nes∣cio,</HI> signifying therby the vnconstancie of his mind in loue. At the first course they brake their Launces to their hands, not so much as once moouing one the other: then taking
<PB REF="32"/> new Launces, they met againe so furiously, that <HI>Henrie</HI> had much to doe to keepe his saddle, and the Duke loosing one of his stirrups, and his raines of his bridle, past on like∣wise, and making an end of their carreare, <HI>Henry</HI> returned with his sword in his hand, which the Duke perceiuing, drew forth his also, beginning betwéene them a right fierce and dangerous conflict. But the Duke béeing better expe∣rienced fought with the greater aduantage, giuing <HI>Henry</HI> leaue a while to follow the rage of his furie, thereby the soo∣ner to weary himselfe. Which indéede he did, when the Duke more fiercely then before assaulted him, causing him to séeke how to couer and defend himselfe vnder his shield. At length, béeing wounded in many places, and hauing lost very much blood, he fell from his horse in aswound, to the great griefe of the King, &amp; all the beholders, who great∣ly feared least he had béen slaine. But béeing conuayed out of the field, and his wounds bound vp, and stanched, hee was soone brought to himselfe.</P>
<P>After him, the Duke ouercame twelue other Knights, not any of them béeing able to indure against him, so intol∣lerable were his blowes: which the <HI>English</HI> Prince percei∣uing, and grieuing to behold, the next day determined vn∣knowne to any one, to enter the Listes disguised, where he did not doubt but hée would soone abate his pride, and re∣soluing hereof, the next morning he armed himselfe, and béeing mounted on a good horse, his Armor séeming all ru∣stie, and his shéeld couered ouer with leather, painted with a Kite and an Eagle flying after a Doue, with this word, <HI>Not to obtaine,</HI> he entred the lists, euen at such time as the Duke had ouerthrowne an <HI>Enlish</HI> Knight which put him∣selfe against him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. Howe Prince <HI>Edward</HI> ouercame the Duke, and afterwards continued in the Listes the rest of the time, ouercomming diuers Knights, and of his declaring his loue to <HI>Emilia.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Prince béeing entred as afore is de∣clared, gaue cause of admiration vnto all beholders, as well by reason of his fur∣niture, as also the deuice of his Shielde, yet was he by the King and diuers others much commended, for his cunning pro∣portion, &amp; gallant managing of his horse, the King saying vnto the Quéene &amp; the Duke of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> that hee much feared, least that Knight would beare away all the honor frō the Duke, which in the two former daies he had wonne. But the Duke himselfe béeing puffed vp with the former victories, nothing at all estéemed him, and comming vnto him, demaunded for his Ladies picture, for whose fauour he was to vndertake the Combat.</P>
<P>The strange Knight replied, that her pieture was inclo∣sed in his hart, and trauailing through that Country, hea∣ring of his Challenge, came purposely thother to try his fortune against him, not hauing the time to prouide any o∣ther portrature, then that which hee had already told him of. The Duke made aunswer, that then he could not com∣bat against him, in regard that ouercōming him, hee should loose the guerdon of his Conquest. But yet séeing hée had such an earnest desire, he should in stéed of her picture, leaue behind him both his Ladies name, and his shield, to be pla∣ced at his disposition.</P>
<P>The Prince héereto willingly consented: and casting his eye to y<SUP>e</SUP> place where the Ladies were standing, after a little pause, sayd. Know then Sir Duke that the Ladie whom I so much loue and estéeme, and whose vertues and graces are so déeply fixed in my hart, that naught but death can ex∣tinguish the same, is the most exquisite, &amp; beautifull Prin∣cesse
<PB REF="33"/> <HI>Emilia</HI> héere present.</P>
<P>The Duke beeing no longer able to harken to his spée∣ches, being his coriuall: answered, no doubt but thy folly, hath ouercome thy braines, &amp; rightly doth y<SUP>e</SUP> figure on thy shield signifie thy madnesse, which is the selfe same Kite there represented, which séeketh before the Eagle to obtaine the Doue: but thou shalt presently féele, the reward of thy folly, if thou abide but the stroke of my Launce. Then tur∣ning about his horse, not staying for any farther reply, went to fetch his course, the other doing the like, and setting spurres to their horses, placing their staues in their rests, they ran together furiously, &amp; like two fierce rammes stri∣uing for superiority, leauing a great distance betwéene them, that with the more might, they may come together with their horned heads, so met these worthy Knights, cau∣sing their Launces to flie into the aire, being broken into a thousand shéeuers, and méeting together with their bodies, causes their horses to réele backwards, to the wounder of the beholders, but quickly recouering themselues, they be∣ganne to assault the one the other: séeking by all meanes, either, how most to indanger his aduersarie, and to saue himselfe: at length the <HI>English</HI> Prince lifting vp his sword aloft, starke the Duke directly on the vpper part of his shield so strong a blow, that cleauing it into two péeces, his sword passed forwards wounding him in the left thygh, but that blow was not long vnreuenged, for lifting vp his sword with both hands, &amp; raising himselfe in his stirrups, gaue the Prince such a blow on the head, that had he not taken it with his sheild, that blow had ended the battaile: but neuerthelesse, passing through both shield and Helme, he gaue him a small hurt in the head, causing him halfe a∣stonied to réele from side to side, but before he could deliuer another blow, the Prince had recouered himselfe, and com∣ming in more fiercely then before, strooke at his head, but by reason of the starting of his horse, the blow lighted on his shoulder, breaking the buckles and reuits of his poul∣dron, and sliding downe, gaue his horse such a wound,
<PB REF="34"/> that being no longer able to containe his Maisters weight, fell to the ground, which the Duke perceauing, made the greater spéede to auoyd his Saddle, and cléering him∣selfe, recouered vpon his féete: which the Prince séeing, a∣lighted also, then taking their swords and shields in hand, they beganne a most cruell and dangerous foote combat, to the amazement of all the beholders, who neuer had séene the like: for being both inraged with enuy and disdaine, like Lions méete, or Bulls, or Tigers, fierce prickt on with hungers rage, finding a pray, or booty to their minds, fall out and striue, and both with téeth, horne, and nayles, wound one the other, renting their entrailes, and dying themselues, and grasse with bloud, so stroue these two, and with their continued equall fight, their stéely Armor being not able to hold out the blowes, nor defend the thrusts, wherewith the one still wounded the other, no man being able to iudge, to which side the victorie would incline, eue∣ry one meruailing who the strange Knight should bee: at last the Duke beganne somewhat to shrinke backe, and to bare the remnant of his shield very low, which the Prince perceauing, séemed to increase his strength, and followed him more fiercely then before, driuing him from place to place, till at last comming before the window where <HI>Emi∣lia</HI> stoode, the Prince casting vp his sight towards her, imediatly stood as one in a traunce, which the other per∣ceauing, beganne againe to gather courage, and gaue him two or thrée mighty blowes, telling him that hee would bring him out of his dumpes. Tis true replied the Prince, being halfe ashamed at his folly, but to your paine. Then plucking vp himselfe, they renewed their battaile, which séemed like to the burning of some hidden flaxe: hauing a while escapt the extremitie of the fire, which had before con∣sumed great woods &amp; trées, and séeming to be extinguisht, presently renewes a flame againe, and so goes out. Such was their latter strife, for the Prince being rowsed from his slumber, persued him with so many waighty blowes, that the Duke being no longer able to hold out, fell to the
<PB REF="34"/> ground in a traunce: which the Iudges perceiuing, came spéedily vnto them, fearing least the strange Knight would haue proffered him farther violence, but he, putting vp his sword, demaunded whether there was ought else to bee doone. The County <HI>Palatine</HI> aunswered, nothing but to de∣fend the place as the Duke had before. Then the Duke was conuaied away, and being vnarmed, was dressed by the Surgians, which found no dangerous wound, but that his great losse of bloud, caused him to bee extreame weake and faintie. The Duke beeing couayed away, the King was very desirous to know who the strange Knight should bee, and being about to send one vnto him, to that end. The Prince presented himselfe before him, and pulling of his Helme, desired his Maiestie to grant him leaue to con∣tinue the Dukes challendge: when the King beheld him, and saw that it was the Prince, who had subdued y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke, his griefe for his hurts, and ouerthrow was somewhat eased. Then speaking to the Prince, hee sayd, my Lord I did not thinke you would haue thus delt with vs, as vn∣knowne, thus to haue put vs into such griefe, as you haue doone by the wounding, and vanquishing of the Duke our Cosin: yet seeing it was his owne folly in making the chal∣lendge, it doth the lesse grieue vs. But for your request in continuance thereof: I would wish you rather, to giue it ouer then to indanger your selfe therein, but if so be you are so minded, we fréely grant you leaue, praying to God send you better hap, then the Duke hath had before you. The Prince humbly thanked his Maiestie: and then tur∣ning to the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> intreated her likewise to graunt him leaue, as her father had doone to defend her beautie, séeing that it was his hap to obtaine the same by his good Fortune. The Princesse being before hand a little touched with his loue, and now séeing the paines and dan∣ger, which he vndertooke for her sake, was altogether o∣uercome: wherefore dying her chéekes with a maidenly blush, she told him the paines which he already tooke, and that he would againe indure for her sake, was vnknowne vnto
<PB REF="35"/> her: yet because she would not prooue discurtious, nor in∣gratefull, séeing the King her father had thereto consented, she was content to accept him for her Knight, and to alow of that which he requested. The Prince héerewith beeing meruailous contented, returned her harty thankes, and so departed againe to the Tent, where hee was met by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Prince, the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and many others: and was by them disarmed, and after din∣ner, his wounds being bound vp, hee armed himselfe a∣gaine in a most costly Armor, set all with true loue knots, wrought of pure gold, and beeing attended by the foresayd Lords, he entred the Lists: where hee had not long remai∣ned before such time, that there came a Knight of the King∣dome of <HI>Naples:</HI> a man in those parts famoused for his va∣lor and hardinesse, and being inamored on a young Dam∣sell of that Country, promised her to come into <HI>France,</HI> whereby his valor, hee would cause her to bee for euer fa∣moused: but his hap was so hard that at the first encoun∣ter, he was sent to measure his length in the ground, not being able to combat. After him that day, and the next day, he vnhorsed to y<SUP>e</SUP> number of 40 Knights: the last day there came very fewe to try themselues, the most part hauing in the fiue former daies, béene by the Duke foyled, by meanes whereof he past away the time in companie of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Prince, and other great Lords, vntill it was almost Sun set, at which time there entred an ill fauoured withered face fellow, something heigher then thrée horse loaues, by birth a pagan, but brought vp by the Quéene of <HI>Portugall,</HI> as her Dwarfe, this proper aplosquire falling in loue with a Damsell, almost as hansome as himselfe, being likewise attending on the Queene, and hauing obtained her good liking on that condition, that he should in all places main∣taine her beauty: desired the Quéene that hee might be made Knight, assuring her that he would so behaue him∣selfe, that thee and all others should thinke the order well bestowed vpon him. The Quéene séeing his earnestnesse yéelded vnto him, and caused him to be Knighted, who no
<PB REF="35"/> sooner hauing receaued the order, and hearing of the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> challendge, but he determined to fight against him, and cause him to confesse his peate, to more beauti∣full then <HI>Emilia.</HI> Continuing in this imagination, he cau∣sed her Picture to be drawne, and therewith came vnto <HI>Parris,</HI> entring the Lists at such time, as the Prince with the other Lords were ready to depart, and comming vnto the <HI>Spanish</HI> Prince, demaunded which was he that had o∣uercome the Duke. The Prince meruailing to sée such a gallant in that equipage, demaunded what he would with him, marry quoth the Dwarfe fight with him, and cause him to confesse, that the Damsell which I loue, doth excell in beauty all others: the Prince smilling, hauing much a∣doe to containe himselfe from laughter, demaunded who was his Lady, and where her Picture was. Hee aunswe∣red she was attending on the Quéene of <HI>Portugall,</HI> and therewith drew foorth her Picture, at sight whereof euery one burst foorth in a great laughter. The Dwarfe being héerewith angry, asked the Prince whether it were he or no that he had inquired for, the Prince aunswered no, but showed him the <HI>English</HI> Prince, withall telling him that the time was past, whereby hée had lost his labor, vnlesse hée could intreate him to Iust willingly.</P>
<P>Then the Dwarfe comming vnto him, intreated him if the time were past, that yet in courtisie he would breake a Launce with him: he smilling aunswered, that betwéene that and Sunne set, hee was bound to Iust with any that should come, wherefore he was contented. Then taking each of them a Launce, they ranne together: the Prince missing his course of purpose, but the Dwarfe with much adoe brake his Launce, almost dismounting himselfe with his owne stroke. The King, &amp; Quéene, withall the Lords and Ladies, laughed hartily héereat: the Dutches of <HI>Bur∣bone</HI> telling <HI>Emilia,</HI> that now her Knight was like to loose all his former honor.</P>
<P>The Dwarfe had no sooner broken his Launce, but pre∣sently he drew forth his swoord, but y<SUP>e</SUP> Prince intreated him,
<PB REF="36"/> to runne one course more, which he easily yéelded vnto, then taking a new speare, they ranne againe: the Prince taking him in the midst of his Shield, bare him out of his saddle a whole speares length, not béeing able to rise from y<SUP>e</SUP> ground. Then was sent vnto him by the King, the young Prince <HI>Phillip</HI> his sonne, to intreate him to come to the Pallace, whether he went, béeing accompanied with diuers great Lords and Knights, and was very roially receiued by the King, the Quéene, and their fayre daughter, and feasted with many sumptuous and rare sorts of viands, after sup∣per, they fell againe to theyr wonted sports of dauncing and masking: where the <HI>English</HI> Prince againe made his loue knowne vnto <HI>Emilia,</HI> assuring her, that vnlesse shée pittied his estate, he was but dead, for without her, he was but as a shadow without substance, or as a body without a soule. The Princesse, who by this time was as much scorched with the flame as hee, and did féele as great force of loue, knew not well what to aunswere, but at last yéelding to loue, she told him, that if he loued her as hee made shew of, shée had no reason but to requite him with the like, but as yet shée was young, and at her Parents disposition, with∣out whose consent she could not make her owne choyse, but if he could obtaine her Fathers consent, shee was likewise contented to accept of him as her Lord and husband.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. How the young Princes of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and <HI>Saxonie,</HI> beeing brought vp together, were so like, that they could scarce be knowne one from the other, &amp; of theyr mutuall loue.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OV remember how the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> bringing with him the young Prince of <HI>Denmarke</HI> into his Dutchie, caused him to be brought vp with his own sonne, calling him by the name of the Gentleman of the Forrest, because they knew no other name that he had. The Dutches, partly by the commandement of her husband, &amp; partly for the beautie shee beheld in him, made great account of him, vsing to play and dandle with him, as much as with her owne sonne: by meanes where∣of, in short time he beganne to recouer a fresh and liuely co∣lour, and still the elder they grew, the more like the children séemed the one to the other: and as in likenes, so also grew they in loue one to the other, delighting alwaies to be to∣gether. And béeing but children, if any one had hapned to wrong either of them, the other would alwaies helpe to be reuenged, which bred in the Duke and Dutches, so great content as might be. But comming to the age of 7. yéeres, they were instructed in the Latine and Gréeke tongues, by a Tutor whō the Duke had appointed them for their bring∣ing vp. Hée béeing a very wife and discréet Knight, who in former time had spent his youthfull dayes in traueling strange Countries, and seeking after aduentures, as was the vsage of Knights arrant: hee hauing as before is said, the charge of education of the two Princes committed vnto him, instructed them so well, that in short time they profi∣ted very much in those languages, especially the Gentle∣man of the Forrest, as béeing of a more quick and readie wit, but otherwise, theyr dispositions, &amp; constitutions both of mind and body were so like, that the Duke was forced to set marks whereby to know them: and theyr loue in like
<PB REF="37"/> manner was so great, that had the one béene sicke or ill at ease, the other séemed to be a partner in his griefe: if the one laughed, the other was ioyfull, if the one wept, the o∣ther must néedes mourne to bare him company, such a sim∣pathy of loue had Nature infused in them, that it was al∣most impossible for the one to liue without the others com∣pany.</P>
<P>And comming to the age of twelue yéeres, they were in∣structed by theyr Tutor, to ride and manage horses, wher∣in they so much profited, that in short time they wexed very skilfull, especially the Gentleman of the Forrest, who both in aptnes of mind, and agilitie of body, passed the most ex∣quisite of his time: which caused the Duke so much y<SUP>e</SUP> more to loue and estéeme of him, hoping that in time, God would manifest from whence, and of what parentage he was dis∣cended, imagining as well by his beauty, as also by his rare forwardnes, y<SUP>t</SUP> he must néedes be issued of noble blood. The Dutches likewise grew into so great a liking of him, for his diuers rare and singuler vertues, y<SUP>t</SUP> she many times deuised with herselfe, how and by what meanes she might cause him to loue her daughter, whom hee estéemed as his Sister, a Lady for beauty excellent, and for the perfections of the mind, able to compare with any then liuing. Shée I say, béeing of this mind, oftentimes resolued to motion the matter vnto him, and to discouer vnto him the manner of his finding, which vnto him was vnknowne, by reason he was alwaies held and accounted as their naturall Childe: yet thinking that course might be a meanes, whē he should come to age, for to forsake their Court, to séeke for his true Parents, shee gaue ouer that determination, minding to conferre with the Duke her husband thereof. And finding him one night very merry, and pleasantly discoursing, and commending of both the young Princes vnto her, shee de∣clared vnto him her mind, and affirmed, that in her consci∣ence, there could be no better match for her daughter, séeing his vertuous behauiour, which was more to be estéemed then my riches whatsoeuer. The Duke did not greatlie
<PB REF="37"/> dislike héereof, but yet thought it fitter to bee left alone, vntill such time as both of them should attaine to a more riper yeares, for as then he was but 12 yeares old, and shée nine yeares old. Héere againe will we leaue them, to speake of the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and his companie: who after they departed from the Ladies Castle, tooke their waies to∣wards the confines of <HI>Germanie.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. How the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> trauelling through <HI>Germanie,</HI> arri∣ued in the Citty of <HI>Ʋiena</HI> in <HI>Austria:</HI> where hee vnder∣tooke the defence of a distressed Lady, wrongfully accu∣sed.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> departing from the Ladies Castle whom he had rescued, at time such as he parted from the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> being accom∣panied with Sir <HI>Cadrus,</HI> Sir <HI>Brewes,</HI> and his Squire: rode on a long time without finding any aduenture worth the remem∣brance, euer inquiring after Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> with the rest of their companie. At length passing through many Townes of <HI>Germanie,</HI> they arriued in a Citty of the Dukedome of <HI>Austria,</HI> called <HI>Viena:</HI> bordering almost on the confines of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> being as then the chiefe Citty of that prouince, and as then vnder the gouernance of a most stirne and rigorous Prince, named Duke <HI>Otho.</HI> Who for his tiranous cruelty, was greatly feared of all his neighbour Potentates, and scarcely beloued of his owne naturall Subiects: hee was a man for vallor, and hardinesse greatly estéemed, and had not his outragious crueltie, and beastly sensuallity stayned his Vertues, hée might well haue béene compared with any Prince, then liuing within the confines of Christendome: but rage and sensuall appetites doth commonly so abound, especially in the harts of great men, whom God hath giuen ouer to
<PB REF="38"/> themselues, that vertue is altogether choked, and swal∣lowed vp in vice, as might well appeare in this Duke <HI>O∣tho.</HI> Who (so he might haue) cared not by what meanes he came by it: as by the sequell of this Chapter, you shall more plainly vnderstand.</P>
<P>This Duke had within his territories, a most gracious and vertuous Ladie, beeing sole heyre vnto her father, who was a man of large possessions, and greatly beloued in his Country, for his vertuous and vpright dealings to euery man. This noble Gentleman dying, and leauing his daughter about the age of 15 or 16 yeares, was sought vnto of many great and mighty Lords: some for her lands and liuings, others for her beauty and vertues, and diuers for both. But to make short this discourse, shee was at last wooed, and wonne by a Knight of that Country, called <HI>Hostinius:</HI> a man who for his vertues and vallor in Chi∣ualry, might be thought equal with any Knight, in <HI>Austria,</HI> and being married vnto the young Lady <HI>Vitella,</HI> they so well loued and liked together, that they scarce one euer gaue cause of dislike to the other, which caused them to bée commended, and praised through all the Dukedome, and the confines there abouts: but this ioy and content, had not continued fully the space of thrée yeares, before that froward Fortune enuying their blessed state, caused her fame to be resounded in y<SUP>e</SUP> eares of the Duke <HI>Otho.</HI> Whose lustfull hart beeing set on fire with report of her beauty, caused both her and her husband to be sent for to his Court, where beeing arriued, hee at the first most kindly receaued them, and as the old prouerbe is, made much of the childe for the Nursses sake: so hee intertained <HI>Hostinius,</HI> vsing him with all the familiarity that might bee for his wifes sake, alwaies séeking opportunity, to make knowne his lustfull loue vnto <HI>Vitilla.</HI> And one day finding her stan∣ding at a window, looking into the Pallace garden: hée came vnto her, and after a little idle prattle, fetching a déepe fained sigh, he declared vnto her his loue, vowing and pro∣testing, vnlesse she tooke pitty on him, and yeeld to his de∣sire,
<PB REF="38"/> there was no way but death with him, aleaging that as her beauty had wounded him, so was it her part to reléeue and comfort him againe, declaring that as by na∣ture she was faire, so likewise ought she to bee kind &amp; mer∣cifull.</P>
<P>The good Lady béeing halfe in a maze with this vnloo∣ked for proces, and scarce knowing how to aunswer him, considering his nature to be such, that an absolute deniall might cause him to grow into choller, both with her and her husband, and therby to worke both theyr confusions. And likewise to féede him on with fained spéeches of loue, might bring her name in question of slaunder, &amp; though for a time by that meanes she might put him off, yet in the end, séeing himselfe deluded, he would reuenge himselfe with the grea∣ter crueltie, determined therefore of two euils to chuse the least: wherefore she replyed in this manner.</P>
<P>My gracious Lorde, I doe not thinke that you will so much dishonour your selfe, as by forcing of mee to violate the holy rites of marriage, and to wrong my Lord and hus∣band in that sort, as by your spéeches you pretend, which if you goe about to performe, know for certainty, that God who created all things of nought, will seuerely punish and reuenge so great a crime: and likewise assure your selfe my Lord, that whilst I haue power and strength to resist, you shall neuer obtaine the same, wherefore I would wish your honor to giue ouer all such wicked imaginations. And here∣with she flung away frō him in a great chafe, leauing him musing on her short aunswer, and deuising which way hée might bring his will to passe, at last resolued with himselfe, that there was no way to accomplish the same, but onely by the death of her husband, hoping that hee béeing dead, shée might be brought to any thing. And béeing thus resol∣ued, he went downe into the great Hall, where finding di∣uers of <HI>Hostinius</HI> seruaunts, hée made choice of one, whom he saw continually most néere vnto him: and taking him a side, declared vnto him his intent, and at last, with large promises wonne him, both to consent, and also to be the
<PB REF="39"/> Actor of his Lords tragedie, which in this sort was acted. About some thrée nights after their agréement, <HI>Estonio,</HI> for so was that false seruaunt named, hauing gotten a sléeping powder, so cunningly cōuayde it into the wine which both his Lord and Lady dranke of, with some of the rest of their néerest attendants, that béeing layd in their bedds, none of them awaked till the morning. In the meane time, euen a∣bout midnight, when both by nature, and effect of theyr drench, they were soundest asléepe, then entred the damna∣ble Traytor, and draue into his Lords head a naile, which he had no sooner performed, but hiding the hammer wher∣with he had committed that cruell homicide, vnder the bed, he departed to his owne bed, where he remained vntill the next day, that all the rest of his fellowes, were risen, and the Chamberlaine, as was his custome, came, and softly knocked at his Lords chamber-doore, wherewith the Lady awaked, and turning about, shée found her Lord and hus∣band as cold as Ice, which strake such a terror in her hart, that fetching a great shréeke, she likewise fell into a traunce. Her damsels which attended her, hearing the shréeke, fea∣ring shée was not well, entred the Chamber, where they found their Lord dead, and theyr Lady in little better case, but at length, hauing recouered life in her, they called in the Gentlemen his attendants, who béeing entred, it is vn∣possible to describe the sorrow and lamentation which was made, where <HI>Estonio,</HI> in outward shewe, séemed not to be least sorrowfull, so well knew he how to dissemble the mat∣ter. At last, the rumor heereof came to the eares of Duke <HI>Otho,</HI> who presently like a man inraged with griefe, hee came posting to the Chamber, where at his first entrance, to make shew of the loue which hee bare to the dead bodie béeing liuing, hée rent his hayre, beating his breast, prote∣sting that he would haue giuen halfe his dukedome, to haue him aliue againe, although (GOD knowes) he himselfe was the onely cause of his death. The good Lady, shee in the meane time swounded, and reswounded, and had it not béene for the damsels, without all doubt shee would haue
<PB REF="39"/> borne her husband company amongst the dead, séeing shée was depriued of him amongst the liuing: so extreame was the gréefe which she felt, &amp; so great the loue which shee bare him.</P>
<P>The Duke in the meane time, for the better obtayning of his purpose, caused y<SUP>e</SUP> dead body to be imbaulmed, saying he would haue him buried with the greatest solemnity that might be, as the man whom he most loued: and because it was impossible to be performed so suddenly, he would haue him kéept vnburied, by the space of a month, against which time he warned all the chéefe of his Subiects to be there. Hoping in y<SUP>e</SUP> meane time by one meanes or other, to worke <HI>Vitella</HI> to his will, wherefore euery day he would come to visite her: many times declaring his passions vnto her, de∣siring her to consent and yéeld thereto. But she good Lady, not minding so soone to forget him whom she loued so déere∣ly, neither yet to make choise of one whom for his wicked life, she could not chuse but hate: and also, by his impor∣tant sute, imagining that to gaine her, he might by some kinde of poyson, haue made away her husband, séeing that so suddenly he died: gaue him this aunswere.</P>
<P>My Lord, I know not the cause of this your importu∣nate sute, neither can I thinke but that it procéeds from a vild and sinfull minde, that professing so great loue as you did to my late Lord and husband, you would tempt me his wofull wife so soone to forget him, and commit so vile an offence before God: wherfore know for a certainty, that I neither can, nor will cōsent to loue him, whom my minde perswads me to bee y<SUP>e</SUP> destroyer of my late deceased Lord &amp; husband: for without you had therein béene guiltfull, you would not haue persisted in this your wicked persute after my honesty.</P>
<P>The Duke knowing himselfe guilty, in that where∣with she had accused him, &amp; also growing into chollor with her rude deniall, briefly replied. Lady I perceaue that, that which cannot be obtained by faire meanes, must now at length be wonne by foule: and séeing that you wil not wil∣lingly
<PB REF="40"/> consent vnto the thing, which in kind and milde sort I haue intreated of you, know for a certainty, that I will winne it by force: &amp; whereas you accuse me of murdering of thy vnfortunate husband, assure thy selfe that the guilte thereof, shall lighten on thy owne head: which I my selfe will iustifie against thée. And thus saying, he departed her chamber, changing all his former loue into cruell hate, al∣waies pondring in his minde reuenge, till such time, as his Nobles being come together, for the solemnizing of the funerals, at which time (comming as if hee would haue viewed the dead corpes) with some of his nobillity, laying his hand on his head, on a sudden he séemed to féele y<SUP>e</SUP> nayle: when fetching a déepe sigh, hee cryed out, that his déere friend <HI>Hostinius,</HI> had béene slaine by treachery. The nobles beholding this sudden accident, came and beheld the same, euery one imediatly iudging, that by that wound he recea∣ued his death. The Duke aboue all others séemed most to wounder héereat, and at length turning to the company, sayd, that he hoped to find out the murtherers, séeing God so strangely had giuen knowledge of the déede, which vntill now was not so much as once dreampt of.</P>
<P>Wherefore presently causing <HI>Vitella,</HI> with all her Dam∣sells and attendants to be atached, he examined them eue∣ry one, and comming to <HI>Estonio,</HI> whom hee before had in∣structed, examined him in such sort, that he declared how that the Lady <HI>Vitilla,</HI> had many times made proffer of her loue vnto him, and that he as often had denied her, because he would not wronge his Lord and Maister: how that she had proffered him, both to murder her husband, and after∣wards to marry with him, if he thereunto would giue his consent: still clearing himselfe as much as it was possible. This confession being vttered, shee poore distressed Lady was foorthwith condemned, not being suffered so much as once to speake for her selfe, <HI>Estonio</HI> was likewise commit∣ted to prison: there for to remaine a while to bléere y<SUP>e</SUP> peo∣ples eyes, who could hardly belieue that, which hee had iustified.</P>
<PB REF="40"/>
<P>The same day the Duke procéeded in iudgement, a∣gainst <HI>Vitella,</HI> where he iudged her for her fault, to loose all her lands, which he imediatly seased on, and that except within sixe months, she could find a Knight y<SUP>t</SUP> should main∣taine her cause, against y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke in single combat: for he as a déere friend vnto her deased husband, would be the man that would prooue that she had comitted treason, and mur∣der against him, with these conditions, that if he were van∣quished, that then she should be deliuered frée, and all her lands and goods restored vnto her, but if it hapnēd that he remained Victor, that both shee and the weake Knight, which should put himselfe in her defence, should be burned a liue at one stake, which he caused for the same purpose to be set vp in the midst of the Market place.</P>
<P>This sentence pronounced, she good Lady was commit∣ted vnder safe kéeping: no body but such whom the Duke appointed, being suffered to come vnto her. Which caused many to iudge the Duke rather to be guilty then she, espe∣cially such who had knowne the great loue betwéene her, and her deceased husband: considering also, that onely by this meanes he had gotten her inhearitance into his hands, which was the chiefest marke he aimed at.</P>
<P>Now to returne againe to our purpose, the Lord <HI>Gwal∣tero</HI> and his company, comming as before wee haue said into <HI>Viena,</HI> hapned to take vp his lodging in a kinsmans house of the Lady <HI>Vitellas,</HI> who (by reason of her mishap) was very sad &amp; pensiue: and béeing sitting at supper, was demaunded the cause of his sorrow by the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> vnto whom hee declared the former discourse, with the loue of the Duke vnto <HI>Vitella,</HI> which he had likewise learned of her, not forgetting in any one poynt, to declare the cōmon wickednesse of the Duke, therby the easier to perswade his crime likewise in this.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> hauing attentiuely listned vnto this discourse, meruailed greatly at the strange tyranny of the Duke, and béeing halfe resolued of the Ladies innocencie, determined with himselfe, to put himselfe in her defence, wherefore de∣maunding
<PB REF="41"/> how hee might come to speake with the Ladie, and also, how néere the time appointed for her execution was expired, (for that he was loth to tarry ouer-long in a∣ny place, because of his returne vnto his Lady &amp; Mistrisse) his Host replied, that the time of her death was now with∣in sixe dayes, and that as yet shee was not prouided of any Champion, because y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke was a strong puissant knight, and the condition of the combat such, that euery one fea∣red to entermedle therein: and as touching the meanes to speake with her, if he would vouchsafe to take the paynes, he would (supper béeing ended) conduct him to the place, where hee should from her owne mouth, heare what shee would say to cléere herselfe. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> béeing by nature pit∣tifull, and also by oath of Knight-hood bound to helpe, and succour those that were distressed, consented to goe with him to the prison. Where béeing come, and brought into the presence of <HI>Vitella,</HI> her Cosin declared the cause of their comming, who after thanks to them giuen, and lifting vp both her eyes and hands towards heauen, protesting her innocencie, she declared as much as she knew touching the same, vtterly denying any loue towards <HI>Estinio,</HI> or any o∣ther, saue onely her Lord <HI>Hostinius. Gwaltero</HI> being fully resolued of her innocencie, demaunded if she would put her case into his hands, who would for her deliuery aduenture his life, and no doubt but her cause béeing iust, God would prosper theyr quarrell. Shée humbly thanking him, answe∣red, that séeing he so curteously offered himselfe, to him and God onely she committed her case: desiring, that according to her innocencie he might spéed therein, and no otherwise. Then taking theyr leaue, till the day came he departed, lea∣uing her somewhat comforted with hope of her Knights good successe, and equitie of her cause.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. How <HI>Gwaltero</HI> combatted with the Duke, and slew him, &amp; of the kind proffers that were made him by <HI>Ʋitella</HI> &amp; the Nobility, with his departure thence.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE day béeing come, wherin the Lady <HI>Vi∣tella</HI> was either to bring foorth her Champi∣on, or else to commit her body to the fire, the Duke béeing royallie accompaned, entred the Lists, causing her in continent to be sent for, and béeing come, demaunded for her Champion, shée aunswered, that God had prouided her one, who at y<SUP>e</SUP> sound of the trumpet would likewise appeare. The Duke hea∣ring that shée was prouided of a Knight, wondred what he should be, and béeing prickt in conscience with the guilt of his fault, grew halfe into dispaire, and would willinglie (if it might haue béen with his honour) haue desisted from the Combat. But God who hardned the hart of <HI>Pharao,</HI> like∣wise hardned his, thereby the more euidently to make knowne vnto the world, his mercy and louing kindnes, to∣wards them that feare him, and his iustice on them, which against their owne consciences commit sinne and iniquitie. So that causing first the Lady to be conuayed towards the stake, the trumpets were sounded, but no Knight was séen to approch, which caused him to grow more proude and in∣solent, thinking then, that no man dared to combat against him. But at the second warning the Lord <HI>Gwaltero</HI> appea∣red, mounted on a mighty Courser, with his Launce on his thigh, and his Helmet on: in this sort came hee before the Iudges, and lifting vp his beuer, made a little shew of reuerence, then procéeding on with his spéech, he said, that béeing accepted of <HI>Vitella</HI> as her Knight, hee was come to defend her innocencie: and that he marueiled, that they be∣ing appointed Iudges of the fielde, would contrary to all reason, send her towards the place of execution, before the Combat were ended: then desiring that she might again be
<PB REF="42"/> sent for, he held his peace: which they foorthwith caused to be done, placing her whereas she might behold the issue of the battell. In the meane time, the Duke comming vnto <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> demaunded what, and of whence hee was, who aunswered, that he was a Knight arrant, of the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and passing through his Country, had heard of his cruelty shewed vnto the distressed Lady, and béeing mooued with pitty, was come to vndertake her defence, which he hoped so well to performe, as before night to cause him confesse his treason against her. The Duke raging hereat, replied, that doubtlesse he was some one of her Mi∣nions, that béeing weary of his life, was come for compa∣ny to be burnt with her, which should be performed with all the torments that might be.</P>
<P>Now by this time <HI>Vitella</HI> béeing brought backe and pla∣ced, the Iudges caused both Knights to be sworne, then be∣ing warned by a Herault euery one to doe his best, they set spurres to theyr horses, and incountred so rudely, that the Duke was throwne out of his saddle, béeing wounded a little vnder the right breast, and sore brused with the fall, <HI>Gwaltero</HI> was not wounded at all, but yet by reason of the mightinesse of the encounter, his horsebacke brake vnder him, wherefore he was in like sort driuen to alight, and be∣ing both on foote, they began a cruell and fierce fight, clea∣uing their shields, and hewing their armor in péeces, so that euery blow caused the blood to trickle downe, dying the gréne grasse into a scarlet hue. Thus continued the fight a long time very vncertaine, no man knowing to whō vic∣tory would incline: some-whiles the one tryumphing in the others losse, and by and by againe, the other reioycing to sée his enemy stoope. Thus continued they the space of thrée houres, the beholders meruailing they could indure so long: at length standing to breathe themselues, the Duke spake vnto him, saying, Knight, thou séest that as yet I haue the aduantage, but the great vallour which I haue found in thée, makes me to pitty thy estate, wherefore I am con∣tented to remit thée the Combat, conditionally that y<SUP>u</SUP> wilt
<PB REF="42"/> remaine with mee, and also I will giue vnto thée halfe of her lands whom thou defendest. Nay, nay, replied <HI>Gwal∣tero,</HI> I scorne thy proffers, but if thou wilt restore the La∣dy and her goods, and confesse héere before this company, thy treason committed against her, I will grant thee thy life: otherwise looke for no mercy at my hands. Then ta∣king theyr swords in their hands, and couering themselues with the remnants of their shields, they fell againe to their former conflict, which cōtinued not long before that <HI>Gwal∣tero</HI> deliuered a mighty blowe on his head, which cleft his Helme in two, and wounded him so sore that hee fell to the ground, which <HI>Gwaltero</HI> séeing, stept vnto him, and would haue slaine him out-right, had not he intreated mercy, pro∣mising to confesse the whole circumstance of the treason.</P>
<P>Then the Iudges cōming vnto him, hee confest first his loue to <HI>Vitella,</HI> then the murder of <HI>Hostinius,</HI> and lastly his hate towards her for refusing him, from whence grew this manner of reuenge which be intended.</P>
<P>No sooner had he made his confession, but turning about his face he immediatly dyed. Then the Iudges caused his body to be carried away, to the intent to haue him interred, but they were saued of that labour, for a flock of Wolues comming from out of the woods there adioyning, deuou∣red his accursed carkasse, to the great admiration of all the beholders. Then immediatly was, <HI>Vitella</HI> brought downe, and greatly honored, and <HI>Estonio</HI> being apprehended, was burned in the fire prepared for his Lady. <HI>Gwaltero</HI> béeing conducted to his lodging by the Nobility and <HI>Vitella,</HI> was by them vnarmed, &amp; his wounds very carefully looked vn∣to, where hee remained the space of eyght wéekes, during which time hee had many great prosfers made him by <HI>Vi∣tella,</HI> as the inioying both of herselfe, &amp; all her inheritance, and by the Nobilitie hee was proffered to be accepted as theyr soueraigne Prince and Duke, if so be hee would ac∣cept of <HI>Vitella</HI> to be his wife. But hee who had setled his minde in another place, gaue thē all harty thanks for theyr good wills towards him, excusing himselfe as well as hee
<PB REF="43"/> might, and desiring them to bestowe it on some one more worthy then himselfe, with whom <HI>Vitella</HI> might be coupled in marriage. Thus excusing himselfe from receiuing that which most men would haue coueted, hee remained there till his woūds were throughly whole, then taking his leaue of <HI>Vitella</HI> and the rest, he departed towards the confines of <HI>Belgica,</HI> hauing receiued of <HI>Vitella</HI> both horse and Armor, for a remembrance of her, in steed of his owne, which in the battell against the Duke was broken and spoyled.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hus being departed from <HI>Viena,</HI> hee was accompanied by diuers of the Nobilitie, till such time as passing the bounds of <HI>Austria,</HI> hee directed his iourny towardes <HI>Flaunders:</HI> at which time the <HI>Austrians</HI> commending him to God, and desiring him at his returne to come that way, they departed a∣gaine towards <HI>Viena,</HI> by whom <HI>Gwaltero</HI> commended to <HI>Vitella.</HI> In this sort being departed, hee rode onwards towards <HI>Flaunders,</HI> disguising himselfe, because he would not be knowne in that Country, where he was beloued of many: at last comming to the Citty of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> he found it still defended, and kept vnder the Subiection of the <HI>Danes,</HI> there likewise he heard of the custome of the Castle of <HI>Cor∣uew,</HI> in the Duchie of <HI>Holland,</HI> made by the Duke <HI>Griffo∣ry.</HI> Which was (that whosoeuer would enter y<SUP>e</SUP> sayd Castle) must first alone Iust with the fiue Knights, who kept the foote of the bridge, one after another, and if it were his hap to ouercome them all, then was he to Iust also with the o∣ther fiue: first with two at once, then against the other thrée, but and if it were his fortune likewise to vanquish them, then was hée to fight with the other 40, by fiue, &amp; by
<PB REF="43"/> fiue, so that it was impossible for one man to vanquish them all. But if it so hapned that the straunge Knight, were by them ouercome, then to loose both his horse and Armor, and so to depart: vnlesse it were such a one whom they knew to be their enemy, and then was he sure to be impri∣soned. This custome he raysed, because thereby he hoped to imprison as many of the <HI>Danske</HI> Knights, as should passe that way in search of their King.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> hearing of this custome, and being desirous to sée the strength and situation of the place (so much spoken of, together, imagining that peraduenture their King might be there imprisoned, as indéede he was) minded to goe sée the same, and then if his minde serued him, to make triall of the aduenture. Thus being resolued, he secretly depar∣ted <HI>Gaunt,</HI> accompanied only with his Squire, leauing be∣hind him both Sir <HI>Brewes</HI> and <HI>Cadrus,</HI> not knowing what was become of him: in this sort he shaped his course the next way thetherwards, where the tenth day after he arri∣ued, about nine of the clocke in the morning: and comming to a shield that hunge on a Trée thereby, strake the same so hard, that the whole Castle resounded thereof. Then came foorth the first fiue Knights, one of them demaunding what he sought: <HI>Gwaltero</HI> told him he would very willing∣ly enter the Castle, to behold whether it were so faire with∣in, as it showed beautiful without. Yea replied the Knight, but first you must according to our custome Iust with me, and my fellowes, whom except you ouercome, you are not like to gaine entrance: I haue heard (replied he) if I be not deceaued, your custome, which maketh me something the more desirous to enter, in regard I thinke that a place so fenced &amp; defended without, cannot chuse but haue things worth the beholding within: wherefore I am contented to make triall of my fortune, by the strength of my arme. Then couching their Launces, they two ranne together so fiercely, that the Knight of the Castle was tumbled head∣long ouer his horse taile, not being able to rise againe, by reason of the weight of his Armor, which so sore brused him
<PB REF="44"/> in his fall. Then ranne another of the Knights, but for hast missed his course: but <HI>Gwaltero</HI> beeing more circomspect, in hauing a great deale of worke to doe, met him so rightly, that his Launce passed through his body aboue a yard, causing him to fall dead to the ground: then his Squire brought him the Launce of the dead Knight, with which he met the third so soundly, that he sent both horse and man to the ground, wherehence he was not able to arise in hast, by reason that both his féete were so fastned in his stirrups, y<SUP>t</SUP> hee could not cléere himselfe, but lay still vnder his horse, which striuing to get vp, had almost squised out his Mai∣sters breath. The fourth whose turne was next to runne, knew not well what to do, for willingly he would haue de∣sisted frō that carrere, but being ashamed to show himselfe so cowardly: he likewise set spurres to his horse, but in y<SUP>e</SUP> en∣counter was sent to beare his fellowes companie. The fift had somewhat better lucke then y<SUP>e</SUP> rest, for at the first course he was not not dismounted, by reason <HI>Gwalteros</HI> horse be∣ing wearied with his former trauell, euen as they came to meet, stumbled vnder him, whereby he mist his course, the other breaking his speare in the midst of his shield, past on without doing any farther hurt: then taking a new Launce they ranne againe, where the second time <HI>Gwalte∣ro</HI> met him so directly, that casting him out of his Saddle backwards, hee pitched on the ground with his head for∣wards, falling so heauie that hee brake his necke withall. Thē <HI>Gwaltero</HI> alighting, made choise of y<SUP>e</SUP> best of their hor∣ses, &amp; mounting thereon came to the bridge foote, where hée found great store of Launces, &amp; making choise of y<SUP>e</SUP> best, he deliuered a couple vnto his Squire, to kéepe for him if occa∣sion serued. Now by this time were two of the other fiue on horse-backe, prouiding themselues for the Iust: and all the rest of the Knights of the Castle, were gathered toge∣ther on the battlements, to behold the issue of the battaile: arming themselues likewise, who should be the next fiue. Thus the two Knights being mounted and furnished at all points, cried vnto <HI>Gwaltero</HI> to defend himselfe: then pla∣cing their Launces in their rests, and setting spurres to
<PB REF="44"/> their horses, they ranne together with all their force, brea∣king their staues in the midst of his shield, with such might, that they caused his horse to stagger backwards, hauing much adoe to recouer himselfe from falling, but he himselfe séemed to moue no more, thē if they had runne against some huge Oke, but his stroke was not to so small purpose, for charging his Lance against him on his right side, gaue him such a sound blow, that piercing both his shield and armor, the speares head entred cleane through his hart, causing him to fall as dead as a dogge to the ground. Then turning about (their course béeing ended) demaunded whether hée must iust with the other Knight againe, and they answered yes: then calling to his Squire to bring him another lance, they ranne againe, where the other Knight was forced to measure his length on the ground, bearing his saddle be∣twéene his legges.</P>
<P>Then againe changing his horse, hee prouided himselfe against the other thrée, who béeing all mounted on verie good horses, charged him at once, two of them breaking theyr staues on his shield, and the other missing his course, was sent headlong to the ground for beeing ouer hastie.</P>
<P><HI>Gwaltero</HI> béeing sore shaken with that incounter, could haue béene contented to haue giuen ouer running for that time, but yet béeing compelled to it by reason of the cu∣stome, tooke a fresh Launce in hand, and there-with met one of them so right, that for euer after he made him sure e∣nough for running. The other perceiuing his fellowes to be slaine, and that no force was able to preuaile against him, determined at the next course to kill his horse vnder him, hoping thereby to saue himselfe from the stroke of his Launce: and béeing thus resolued, ranne againe, direc∣ting the poynt of his Launce full against <HI>Gwalteros</HI> horse brest, where entring, he slew the horse, but escaped not him selfe so well as he hoped for, by reason that the horse com∣ming so fiercely, gaue something backe, but brought his Maister so néere him, that he strooke him full in the fight of the Helme, and the barre béeing weake, gaue passage for
<PB REF="45"/> the speare to his braines, so that they fell to the ground both together. And <HI>Gwaltero</HI> cléering his féet out of the stirrups, lightly recouered himselfe againe, and adressing his shielde on his arme, with his sword in his hand, hee marched to∣wards the Castle gate, minding (séeing that he had procée∣ded so farre) either to enter, or die in the pursute. But be∣fore hee was come fully to the entrance, the fiue Knights, who were appointed to combat first with him, came foorth, and all at once assaulted him: then beganne there a most fierce and bloody fight, very hard and vnequall, by reason they béeing fiue, and he but one, and also before ouerlabo∣red with his former trauell, was not able to doe as other∣wise he would: yet notwithstanding, he layd on such cruel blowes, that euery one iudged himselfe happiest when as he was farthest from him, the lookers on admiring how it was possible for one alone Knight, to shewe such prowesse, as by defending himselfe against so many, but at last being ouer∣wearied, &amp; wounded in many places, hauing lost much of his blood, was forced through faintnes to fal to the ground, hauing before his fall slaine two of them out-right, and very sorely wounded the others, then béeing no longer able to resistance, he was carried prisoner into the Castle, where he had his wounds bound vp &amp; dressed, being pittied of many who had beheld his vallor, but béeing cured of his wounds, and examined of whence he was, hee was committed priso∣ner into the dungion where the wofull King lay, thereby thinking the more to grieue him. Who no sooner was let in-the dungion, but they one knew the other, making the grea∣test lamentation and sorrow that might be, but at length comforting themselues as well as they might, they made relation of their fortunes each to other, hoping that in time God would send them deliuerance from all theyr troubles. Héere will we leaue them, to tell a little what hapned in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> through the mallice of the Gouer∣nours one to another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. How the Archbishop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> the County <HI>Hermes,</HI> &amp; the Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> disliking the gouernment, went about to make a King amongst them.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> hauing béene without their King, by the space of 17 yeares, and vnder the gouernment of a certaine company of States, elected as is before declared: many beganne to dis∣like with y<SUP>e</SUP> gouernment therof, amongst whom the chiefe and principall, were the Archbishop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> a man very well learned, but giuen altogether vnto nouelties and change, the County <HI>Hermes,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> all thrée great men, and such as were in a manner, the only Authors of that go∣uernment: and the first yeare were themselues chiefe go∣uernours in that established estate, as appeareth in the fourth Chapter of this present Booke.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, (al this and their solemne vowes, ratified vnder their hands and seales, for the continuance, and performance of that kind of state, and gouernment) they were in a manner, the first that repined against it, séeking by all the meanes they could, to ouerthrow and ex∣tinguish the same, either for the enuy they bare towardes those who were Gouernors, or for that themselues had ne∣uer since the first yeare hapned to be of the twelue, or else (and that which I thinke to be most likeliest) beeing stir∣red vp by the deuill, they desired greater superiority, then either became them, or by any waies they were worthy of, yet doubting to agrée within themselues, being but thrée, hauing the gouernance in their owne hands, determined therefore to elect and chuse a King: who beeing by them so raised, could not chuse likewise but to be rulde by them, and that vnder the cullour of the King, they might reuenge themselues of their enemies: and likewise preferre their
<PB REF="46"/> friends to honor and dignitie. And hauing thus resolued betwéene themselues, they solicited the <HI>Scottish</HI> King to ac∣cept of the Diadem, promising him by their letters, that if he would but send ouer tenne thousand Souldiers, vnder the conduct of some expert Leader or Captaine, that then they would so ayde him, that in lesse then a yeare, he should haue all <HI>Denmarke</HI> in his subiection: conditionally, that they thrée might continually haue and inioy to themselues, the chiefe offices belonging to that Kingdome.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scottish</HI> King (harkning vnto this iolly proffer) at the first made small account thereof: but afterwards way∣ing with himselfe the great benefits and proffits, which thereby might rise, not onely to him: but to all his King∣dome and Subiects, if he might so easily obtaine the same, as in their letters they made showe of: and beeing againe by them solicited anew, writing vnto him in their letters, that vnlesse he accepted thereof, they would giue it vnto the King of <HI>England,</HI> or some other Prince, whom they knew would more thankefully accept of their kind offer. The County <HI>Hermes</HI> in a priuate letter besides, wrote how that if his Maiestie would (hauing conquered the Kingdome) make him Viceroy or Deputy thereof, he would send ouer his eldest sonne to remaine as pledge, vntill such time as he had performed, whatsoeuer hee made promise of: and that then he would render him such tribute, as by his Ma∣iestie should be thought fit. Now when he had himselfe per∣used these letters, (and cast all doubts he could) he made them knowne to his priuy Counsell, who after long delibe∣ration, at length gaue him this answere, that they were al∣so of the minde, his Maiestie should accept their proffer of the Kingdome a gift well worth the acceptance, and far∣ther, to graunt them their owne desires, in that which they should demaunde, till such time as beeing Maister of the Country, hee might at his pleasure, then alter any thing that he would. In the meane time, to receaue pledges of their meaning, least otherwise he might repent too late. Thus hauing determined, the King sent ouer secretly vn∣to
<PB REF="46"/> them, to certifie them of his intent, assuring each of them the greatest dignities and honor, that the Kingdome would yéeld: intreating thē likewise, to send ouer their Hostages, vpon whose arriuall his forces should be ready to be ship∣ped, vnder the conduct of his Cosen, the Lord <HI>Douglasse,</HI> a man for his experience and vallor excellent.</P>
<P>These letters being thus secretly conuaied, were most welcome newes vnto those arch Traytors to their Coun∣try, who foorthwith sent for Hostages the County <HI>Hermes</HI> his eldest sonne, a gallant young youth, and one whom in time might haue prooued an honorable man. The Lord <HI>Harding</HI> had but one only daughter, and her he sent vnder cullour to be brought vp with the <HI>Scottish</HI> Princesse, &amp; for the Arch Traytor (Archbishop I would say) was sent an Nephew of his, an excellent good Scholler, &amp; a notable Pol∣litician. These being sent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> they appointed the Kings forces to be ready by the tenth of May then next in∣suing: and they in the meane time made all the prouision that might be, where we will likewise leaue them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of a strange aduenture hapning in the Court of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> and how the Gentleman of the Forrest, and <HI>Iago</HI> were Knigh∣ted, and how the aduenture was ended.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here was in the Kingdome of <HI>Spaine,</HI> a noble man called <HI>Segnior Adresto,</HI> famous for his vertues and Chiualry: and hauing passed o∣uer a great part of the world, in séeking and following of strange aduentures, alwaies hauing fortu∣nate successe in all his enterprises, especially in his loue, which hee bare towards a noble Lady of his owne Coun∣try, called <HI>Leonarda,</HI> daughter and sole heyre vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke of <HI>Tolledo:</HI> one who for beauty and comlinesse of body, was the only paragon of all <HI>Spaine,</HI> sought vnto by many, but only inioyed by <HI>Adresto,</HI> betwéene whom there grew so great loue, that whosoeuer had séene or knowne the same,
<PB REF="47"/> would haue sworne, that then loue there had béene no grea∣ter dietie. Which when the Duke her father vnderstoode, being loth to match her vnto one of so meane estate, al∣though for his vertues he might compare with any, yet was his liuings very small: therefore he often warned her to auoyd his company, and at length grew in great displea∣sure w<SUP>t</SUP> her, threatning to disinherit her, if she did not obey vnto his will héerein. Which the young Lady doubting, at their next méeting, made him priuy withall, assuring him that for his loue she could be contented to forsake all. But yet séeing that in time her fathers good will might bee ob∣tained, she would intreate him for a while to absence him∣selfe: assuring him, that for her part, she would alwaies continue faithfull and constant vnto him, and neuer accept of any other husband, though thereby she were disinherited. <HI>Adresto</HI> hearing her kind and louing spéeches, aunswered, that séeing it was her pleasure, he was contented, although to be out of her presence would bee a hell vnto him: and whereas shée had made him so frée a graunt of her loue, he protested before the heauens likewise neuer to forsake her, and that before he would consent to loue any other thē her∣selfe, he would be torne to péeces with wilde horses: then deliuering each other asigne of their passed faiths, he depar∣ted. And within short time after left the Kingdome, trauel∣ling many strange and vnknowne Regions, till at last comming into the Kings of <HI>Ireland,</HI> hee hapned to fall in likingly with a beautifull Damsell of that Country, but of meane parentage: her father being but a Marchant of that Country. On whom he so doted, that he had cleane forgot∣ten, and forsaken the chast and vertuous Lady <HI>Lenarda:</HI> although the good Lady hauing intelligence héereof, by a friend of hers, a skilfull Magitian, oft times sent vnto him, to cause him to call to minde his former loue. At length the Duke her father dying, and leauing her sole Mistirs and Dutches of his Dukedome, shee hauing with great pompe &amp; solemnitie celebrated his funerals, one day sent for her friend the Magitian to come vnto hor, of whom she demaunded if there were no meanes, to recall her louer
<PB REF="47"/> <HI>Adresto</HI> againe, without whom she was like to spend her life time in care and heauinesse. <HI>Adriano,</HI> (for so the Magi∣tian was called) made her aunswere, that he could not di∣rectly aunswere her demaunde: because that she (whom he so loued) wore alwaies on her finger a Ring, which was the only stay of his loue, which except they could get from her, it was impossible, euer to remooue his affection. Also this Ring had one other vertue, which was that whosoe∣uer did weare it, should not loose so much as a drop of blood in any battaile whatsoeuer: wherefore when he combatted with any one, (as oft times he did for her loue,) then had he the Ring. And vnlesse there could be found a Knight, that might by force conquer him in single battaile, and take away the Ring from him, it was impossible to get the same by any deceit whatsoeuer. <HI>Lenarda</HI> hearing this, was as one halfe besides herselfe, but being comforted by <HI>Adriano,</HI> (who assured her he would trie the vttermost of his skill to find out the Knight, as he had spoken of.) Then taking his leaue of her, he returned home: where by his art he framed a most rich and faire sword, excellent curious to the eye, and to cut, the best that was then in the whole world: this sword he inchaunted in such sort, that no man but hée to whom the conquest of <HI>Adresto</HI> appertained, might drawe the same: then bringing it to <HI>Lenarda,</HI> willed her to send one of her Squires therwith, to séeke out the Knight who should by his vallor recouer her loue: then deliuering it to one of her Squires, whom she estéemed for his truth and secricie, with this commaunde, that whosoeuer should offer to draw foorth y<SUP>e</SUP> sword, should first make promise of a boone, which was to goe ouer into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to combat with <HI>Adresto,</HI> accusing him for falcifying of his faith to <HI>Lenarda.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Squire (hauing the sword) trauelled to all the Princes Courts in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and Countries thereabouts: then into <HI>Fraunce, Italie,</HI> and <HI>Germanie,</HI> neuer finding any one that could once mooue it in the Scaberd: although ma∣ny stout &amp; hardy Knights made triall thereof, to this great griefe, fearing his trauell should neuer haue end, nor his Lady ease of her sorrowe. In this manner hauing trauel∣led
<PB REF="48"/> through most part of <HI>Germanie:</HI> he arriued at the Court of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> desiring the Duke y<SUP>t</SUP> his Knights might make triall, if it were any their fortunes to accomplish that, for which hee had trauailed she greatest part of Christendome. Then shewing his sword, hee declared, that bearing the same a whole yeere, he could neuer finde any one y<SUP>t</SUP> might draw the same. The Duke wondring héereat, immediatly after Dinner, caused all his Knights to make triall therof, himselfe béeing the first, but al to no end applyed they their forces. Which when the young Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> and the Gen∣tleman of the Forrest beheld, they presently fell on theyr knées before the Duke, desiring his grace to grant them the order of knight-hood, hoping that for one of them this Aduenture was reserued.</P>
<P>The Duke béeing vnwilling at the first, by reason of their young age, that béeing knighted, they would hazard themselues in séeking after strange aduentures, aduised them to stay a yéere or two more, before they tooke so wai∣tie a charge on them: affirming that it was vnlawfull to dubbe any one, before the age of twenty, at which time they would be strong, and able to indure the weight of their Ar∣mour and trauell, and not before. All which could not cause them to desist from theyr sute, but still more earnestlie they craued the same, alleaging many sundry examples of those who at younger yéeres had inured themselues to as great labours, as <HI>Reynaldo</HI> at the age of fiftéene yéeres stealing from his fathers court, went into <HI>Palestina</HI> to the Christian Armie, where vnder great <HI>Godfry</HI> of <HI>Bullen,</HI> he obtained to be the chiefe scourge to the Sarasins, and without whom, it had béene impossible to haue wonne the holy Citty of <HI>Ie∣rusalem.</HI> This and many other such like arguments they alleaged, wherby at length they obtained the Duke to con∣sent vnto them: willing them for that night, according to the auncient custome, to watch in the Chappell. Then tur∣ning to the Squire, hee intreated him to tarry till the next day, séeing the two young Gentlemen were so desirous. The Squire, to satis-fie the Duke, willingly consented, al∣though
<PB REF="48"/> he had no great hope of theyr successe.</P>
<P>The two Princes carefull of their charge, hauing theyr Armor and other necessaries prouided, kept theyr deuout watch all night, sometimes accompanied by the young Princesse, and diuers other Ladies, they passed away the time till the morning: at what time the Duke cōming vn∣to them, accompanied with many Lords &amp; Knights, with his owne hands buckled on theyr spurres, and then draw∣ing foorth their swords, gaue them the gentle <HI>Accolado.</HI> Then raysing them vp, desired GOD to make them both good and valiant Knights. Then hearing deuine seruice, they returned into the great Hall, to make triall of the in∣chaunted Sword, where first the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> as the elder, made tryall, but by no meanes was able to draw it, then taking it to the Gentleman of the Forrest, he said, Brother God giue you better luck then I, or else this Squire is like to indure more labour. True replied he, &amp; I doubt it great∣ly, séeing that you haue mist: then putting his hands on the Hilts, he drew it foorth as easily, as if it had béene an ordi∣nary sword, to the great wonder of the Duke, and all the beholders. Then the Squire falling on his knees, tolde him, that the boone which he required, was to goe into <HI>Ire∣land</HI> with him, where he should combat with a Knight, bée∣ing the falsest Louer that might be: and therewith declared the whole discourse of his Lady and <HI>Adresto,</HI> as is before recited. Héere wee will leaue the Gentleman of the For∣rest, preparing himselfe to goe with the Squire into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to combat <HI>Adresto,</HI> concluding the first part of our History.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. How <HI>Euordanus</HI> called the Gentleman of the Forrest, hauing receaued order of Knighthood, departed towards <HI>Ireland</HI> with the Squire of <HI>Lenarda,</HI> Dutches of <HI>Toledo.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou may remember, how that in the former part of this historie, the young Princes <HI>E∣uordanus</HI> and <HI>Iago,</HI> hauing receaued the or∣der of Knighthoode, and the aduenture of the inchaunted sword, being finished by <HI>Euor∣danus,</HI> he was thereupon to trauell into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to combat with <HI>Adresto:</HI> and now hauing stayed by the Duke and Dutches intreaty, some thrée or foure daies, in which time there was a small Barke prepared, for his better transpor∣ting himselfe, and such necessaries as in his iourny should be néedefull vnto him: and now the winde seruing fitly for their intended course, he was hastned on by the Squire to depart, who declared vnto him the great griefe and hea∣uines, which in this meane time his noble and excellent Lady the Dutches <HI>Lenarda</HI> indured, then which hée was sure there could be no greater torment possible.</P>
<P>And now all things béeing fitted in readinesse for their departure, hee came before the Duke to take his leaue, where falling downe on his knées, proffering to kisse his graces hands, the Duke lift him vp from the ground, im∣bracing him in his armes, and with teares trickling downe
<PB REF="50"/> his manly chéekes commended him to God, desiring him that he would returne againe vnto his Court his aduen∣ture being finished, with as much spéede as might bee, whereas he should be as hartily welcome, as his owne na∣tural son y<SUP>e</SUP> prince <HI>Iago.</HI> These &amp; many other such like spée∣ches the Duke then vsed vnto him, which draue the Knight into a great admiration, especially of the words that hée should be as welcome vnto him, as the Prince <HI>Iago.</HI> By which and the strange name he was called by, it was to be doubted whether hee were the Dukes sonne or not: which before this time he had neuer heard, nor so much as once dreampt of, so secret had his finding béene consealed from him. And being about to demaunde the same of the Duke, he was put from his purpose by a messenger, which was sent vnto him by the Dutches, to will him to come vnto her in her chamber: where hearing of his taking leaue of the Duke, she attended his comming, being accompani∣ed with her daughter the Princesse <HI>Egisena,</HI> who was now attained to the age of 15 yeares, and by continuall frequenting the company of the Gentleman of the Forrest, somewhat touched with loue towards him, and vnderstan∣ding by her mother (who desired nothing more then to sée them ioyned together in marriage) that they were no kin, had set downe her rest, if he thereto consented, to accept of no other husband.</P>
<P>Thus leauing the Duke, not a little grieued for his de∣parture, he came vnto the Dutches her chamber, where as he found both the mother and daughter, so ouercharged with sorrow for his departure: that of a long time they were not able to vtter a word. But at length the Dutches, recouering the former vse of her tongue, with a déepe sigh procéeding from her hart, which manifestly showed the in∣ward griefe, she sustained for his departure, and with her eyes stedfastly fixed on him, spake as followeth.</P>
<P>Gentleman of the Forrest, for sonne I may no longer call you: the great loue which I haue alwaies borne vnto you, I am sure you know to be no lesse then that, either to
<PB REF="50"/> your supposed brother the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> or your sister <HI>E∣gisena,</HI> although as by my former spéeches, you may per∣ceaue you were not my owne naturall childe, but in your infancy found by my Lord the Duke in a Forrest, in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> of which place you haue e∣uer since béene called the Gentleman of the Forrest: no man knowing of what parentage you are discended, nor what other name then this, which the Duke gaue you to call you by.

<P>Farther would she haue procéeded, but the teares trick∣ling downe her chéekes, stopped the passage of her farther spéeches: when the young Knight hauing attentiuely list∣ned vnto her former words, to the which those of the Duke séemed to concure?</P>
<P>Replied, most worthy Princesse, these your spéeches hath strooke such an amazednesse into my vnderstanding, that I knowe not well what to speake or thinke, but my vnto∣wardlinesse did alwaies foreshowe, that I was not dis∣cended of so royall an ofspring, as my Lord the Duke: yet notwithstanding, my minde foretelleth me, I am not so basely descended, but that I may hope for to challendge my selfe to be a Gentleman: and make knowne this high or∣der, which my Lord the Duke hath bestowed vpon mee of Knighthoode, not to surpasse my estate: wherefore I vow and protest before God, héere in your Graces presence, not to rest nor inioy quiet abode in any place, vntill such time as I haue found out those from whom I am descended. In the meane time, I humbly intreate you to estéeme of mée, though vnworthily as your faithfull and deuoted seruant: farther desiring y<SUP>t</SUP> Princesse <HI>Egisena,</HI> to honor me with y<SUP>e</SUP> ti∣tle of being her Knight, vnder whose protection I cannot
<PB REF="51"/> looke for ought other then good successe.</P>
<P>The Dutches being as ioyfull of this his conclusion, as sorrowfull for his vowed determination, stood still a while making no aunswere at all. But at last being resolued in her minde, that now or neuer it was time to follow her de∣uised drift: fixed her eyes stedfastly on him, &amp; turning her spéeches to her daughter, sayd. <HI>Egisena,</HI> I perceaue now that which I alwaies feared is come to passe, concerning the loue betwéene you and this our new Knight, which since I perceaue to be true, and that to striue againe destenie is bootelesse, I both will and commaunde you, on paine of in∣curring my displeasure, and by the natural loue you ought to beare me, I coniure you, not to conceale, but to make knowne vnto me, whether there be any such loue-liking be∣twéene you, as outward showes séeme to make manifest: which if there be, I will séeke some meanes to worke both your contents, which will be a cause to drawe this Gentle∣man, the sooner againe vnto this our Court.</P>
<P>The Princesse that had already béene instructed in her mothers drift, and being likewise thereunto of her selfe ve∣ry willing, dying her chéekes with her maidenly blush, made her this aunswere. Most gracious Princesse and lo∣uing mother, I doe not well knowe whereunto these your spéeches may intend, considering that these vaine toyes of loue, as yet I was neuer acquainted with, but yet thus much I must néedes confesse, that the liking which I haue alwaies had to this Gentleman of the Forrest, procéeded as I haue still thought, from the naturall loue of a sister to∣wards her brother: and since the knowing of the con∣trary, hath continued, or I may say, bred a greater liking then to any other whatsoeuer: but not in such sort, as by making choise of him, either to displease you or my father.</P>
<P>The Knight being as ioyfull as might be, to heare them in these tearmes: for howsoeuer darkly she spake, yet loue had so sharpned his wits, y<SUP>t</SUP> he gessed very neere their mea∣ning, and comming to the Princesse kissed her hands for those vnséene kindnesses, desiring her in all humility, to ac∣cept
<PB REF="51"/> him as her humble seruant, and faithfull Knight: in token whereof she would bestow some thing on him, which in all his aduentures might put him in minde of her excel∣lency, although her kind curtesies were already, so set∣led in his hart, as it was for euer impossible to bée worne out.</P>
<P>Farther would he haue procéeded, but that the Squire earnest of his Mistrisses charge, sent vp to hastē him away, which both the Dutches, and her daughter vnwilling to yéeld vnto, at last consented.</P>
<P><HI>Egisena</HI> for a fauor deliuered him a faire Diamond, which alwaies she worne on her finger. Thus taking his leaue of them, beeing accompanied with the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> and di∣uers other noble men, he was conuaied vnto the Sea-side, where they found his ship ready prouided, &amp; hauing winde at will, were ready to set saile.

The Prince <HI>Iago</HI> many times intreating to accompanie him in his voyage, regarding more his company then his fathers displeasure. But hee hauing determined a longer voyage in his minde: then suddenly to returne, would by no meanes consent vnto the Princes request. Thus at length, as each thing hath his time and end, séeing no in∣treaty would serue, hee committed him to the tuition of the almighty God, desiring his prosperous and spéedie re∣turne.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. How the Gentleman of the Forrest, sayling towards <HI>Ireland,</HI> landed in <HI>Northwales,</HI> where he fought with a huge Mon∣ster, and what was the successe thereof.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Gentleman of the Forrest, beeing a∣boorde, and hauing taken his leaue of the Prince, and the rest of his friends, they set saile, hauing the wind fayre, and the Seas calme, euen as if <HI>Neptune</HI> had roused vp himselfe to welcome some déere friend, the Dolphins, Porpises, and other strange fishes, playing a∣boue the waters round about the Shippe, as béeing sent of purpose to shewe pleasure to the passengers: whereat our new Knight tooke no small content. Thus passing away the time, somewhiles in beholding the fishes, and other sea sights, and in pleasant and merry talke with the Pilot, and Maister of the Ship, concerning the customes and maners of the Seas, they sayled by the space of eyght dayes, with a prosperous and large wind, when towards the euening, the Maister looking abroad, to sée whether he could discerne any land, happened to sée in the West north west, a small clowde, rising in manner of a mans hand, which the more he beheld, the blacker still it séemed, which caused him to doubt some insuing storme: therefore willing his company to take in their top sayles, and also to vnlace theyr drablets and bannets, determining to try with theyr Cosses onely. Scarce had they obeyed halfe his commaundement, when the Sky béeing before very cléere, began to ouercast, and the winds to blow in such sort, that in lesse space then an houre, the Seas were growne so outragious, that it séemed euery billow straue one with the other, which should first boord their distressed burthen: the boat-swaine and his fel∣lowes, indeuouring with all theyr might, to take in that lit∣tle saile which they bare, and although it were but their cos∣ses, yet could they not doe it without great danger &amp; paine.
<PB REF="52"/> Others found themselues busied in pomping and casting foorth the water, each man imploying his best help for their liues ayde. And the Prince, although vnskilfull, yet labo∣ring as hard as any of the rest, sometimes taking his turne at the pumpe, sometimes to lift ouer-boord such thinges, as might any waies be a hinderance, to the more light work∣ing of their shippe on the Seas: so that his labour was pro∣fitable two waies, the one of it selfe, wherein he did asmuch good as any man, the other his example, which caused eue∣ry one to be the more willing to performe their labor. Thus continued the storme for the space of two daies, to the great discomfort of all the company, but especially of the Knight, who béeing ouertrauailed with labour, and his bodie not béeing to-fore vsed vnto the Sea, repaired into his Cabin, and casting himselfe on his bed, hoping to take some ease∣ment to his restlesse body: but sléepe, the comforter of those that are weary, yéelded him small reliefe, for no sooner were his eyes closed, but that the memory of the Princesse <HI>Egisenas</HI> beauty represented it selfe vnto him: then would he consider with himselfe the likelihood of his obtaining her, as the great fauor which both the Duke her father alwaies shewed vnto him, and the kinde spéeches at their last far∣well, as also the vowed loue betwixt himselfe, &amp; the Prince her Brother, which séemed to promise vnto him an assured obtayning. But on the contrary side, he would obiect his owne vnworthines, as béeing but peraduenture of base or meane Parentage, then the great &amp; mighty Princes which were desirous of her loue: and last and not least, that his absence, (as oft times it dooth) in her likewise might breed forgetfulnes.</P>
<P>Thus reuoluing many things in his mind, hee determi∣ned, if God so pleased, after his enterprise against <HI>Adresto</HI> ended, hee would trauell into <HI>Denmarke,</HI> hoping there to learne somewhat concerning his estate, or else peraduen∣ture to trauel along with the Squire &amp; <HI>Adresto</HI> into <HI>Spaine,</HI> where he doubted not but that <HI>Adriano</HI> should resolue him of that doubt. In this manner passed hee away most part
<PB REF="53"/> of the night, till towards the morning, <HI>Morpheus</HI> pittying his restlesse estate, closed his eyes, causing him to inioy a short slumber. But long he had not slept, before y<SUP>t</SUP> hee was awaked by a ioyfull cry, made by the whole company, vp∣pon the sight of Land: but the wind béeing come to y<SUP>e</SUP> North¦ward, they were forced to put in for a harbor, called at this day <HI>Milford-hauen,</HI> where comming ashore, they determi∣ned to rest themselues, and prouide such necessaries as they wanted, against the winde should serue for <HI>Ireland,</HI> which from thence was but a short cut.</P>
<P>The next day, the Gentleman of the Forrest beeing (as is before-said) weary of the Sea, determined to goe recre∣ate himselfe ashore, wherefore taking his horse and armor, accompanied onely with his Squire, he rode forth to view the Country, which he found to be indifferent fruitfull and pleasant, but could sée very few or no Inhabitants, which caused him not a little to meruaile: thus rode he on y<SUP>e</SUP> space of two leagues, beholding many goodly streames, &amp; plea∣sant shadowes, the delight wherof, caused the way to séeme very short. At length, comming to a small Riuers side, hée alighted to rest himselfe, and deliuering his horse to his Squire, hée layde himselfe downe at the féete of a statelie Béech trée, whose thicke branches were a shelter vnto him from the piercing heate of <HI>Phoebus</HI> golden rayes, where he was quickly luld asléepe, with the chirping tunes of plea∣sant birds, and bubling noyse of the soft-slyding streame. Long had hee not rested in this pleasant place, before such time as he was wakened by a pittifull out-cry, and starting vp halfe amazed, he beheld a most huge and mighty Mon∣ster, in forme somewhat bigger then a Cammell, his head and face not much vnlike a man, his mouth very large, as about a yard in widenes, his téeth vpwards of a foote long, his breast and foreféete, much like to a Lyon, his backe large and long, and for his hinder parts they were like vn∣to a Beare: all his body béeing thicke set with bristles, so hard as it was vnpossible for any sword to pierce his skin. Which at the first sight caused him to stand some what a∣mazed,
<PB REF="53"/> till perceiuing the Monster almost to haue ouerta∣ken his Squire, whom he pursued to haue deuoured, hee clapt on his Helme, and taking his Launce in his hand, he ranne to succour him, and comming néere vnto him, smote the Monster such a blow, as well might haue ouerthrowne a good Knight, but to him it did no harme at all, which cau∣sed him greatly to doubt the issue of their conflict: the beast féeling himselfe striken behind, left the pursute of the squire, and turned about to the Knight, thinking to haue deuou∣red him, and at the first layd hold on his shield with his two fore-feete, and with his mouth seased on his Helme, pres∣sing the same with his long téeth, to the no small doubt and astonishment of the Knight, but as good hap was, he might then thank hast, for in clasping on his Helme he had forgot∣ten to fasten it, which was an occasion, that at the first pul it came from his head, which otherwise would haue pier∣ced his braines. This hapned not a little to the aduantage of the Knight, who although his head were vnarmed, yet that want of Armor so armed the Monsters téeth, that for his life he could not cléere himselfe thereof. Which gaue the Knight occasion to make a full thrust at his breast, where the skin béeing not so hard as in the other parts of his bo∣die, gaue entrance to his trustie blade, which pierced so déepe, that it caused great abundance of bloode to follow af∣ter it: which the beast perceiuing, gaue a loude cry, and withall let goe his shield, and tooke holde on his left shoul∣der, giuing him so kind a salutation with his sharp nayles, that he brought away the armor and flesh, hard to the bone, receiuing in the meane time a sound blow on the deformed head, which caused him to réele backwards. But his skin was so hard, that it pierced no more then if hee had striken vppon an Anuile of stéele. Thus continued they a great while, the Monster still assailing, and he auoyding, watch∣ing his best aduantage to make thrusts, séeing blowes did nothing at all auaile. At length, beeing weary, and some∣thing fainting by reason of his hurt, hee gaue backe a little to refresh himselfe, which the Monster perceiuing, lay
<PB REF="54"/> downe, and with his clawes sought meanes to cléere him∣selfe of the Helme which hung fast in his téeth, but before he was able to frée himselfe thereof, the Knight who slacked not to take the least aduantage that might be, gaue him so sore a hurt in the belly, that it caused both his blood &amp; guts to issue out together, which the Monster féeling, and striuing to recouer himselfe on his féete, strained so much, that hee caused his hellish soule to depart from his damned body.</P>
<P>The Knight séeing himselfe Victor, knéeled downe im∣mediatly on the ground, rendring praise and thanks to the almighty GOD, for his prosperous and happy successe in this his first enterprise. Then his Squire comming vn∣to him, he made hast to bind vp his wounds, and to depart towards his Ship, where hee might with more ease &amp; lesse danger, be cured of his hurts, which grieued him not a lit∣tle, especially y<SUP>t</SUP> in his left shoulder. But before such time as they were fully ready to depart, there came vnto them an old man, clothed like a Hermite, his head and beard be∣ing as white as milke, bearing in one hand a small viole of water, and in the other a boxe of oyntment, and when hee came vnto them, he saluted them very curtiously, telling the Knight, that of long time he had expected his comming into that distressed place.</P>
<P>The Knight as curteously regréeted him, &amp; afterwards demaunded, if he knew any place where he might be cured of some small wounds which he had receiued, so which the Hermite replied, that within lesse then halfe a league he had a small Cell, whether if it pleased him to goe, he would not doubt but within few dayes to cure him: in y<SUP>e</SUP> meane time, he would a little wash and annoint the same, with such wa∣ter and oyntment, as hee had for the same purpose brought with him, the Knight glad hereof, gaue him harty thanks, and hauing had his wounds drest, departed with him to∣wards his Cell, where his wounds were cured, as hereaf∣ter you shall heare, with the occasion of the Monsters bee∣ing in that place. In the meane time, wee will roturne to speake somewhat of the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. How Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> departed from the Court of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and arriued in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they heard of the aduenture of <HI>Coruew:</HI> and how they were both ta∣ken prisoners.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter Prince <HI>Edward</HI> had ouercome y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and continued the defence of the Princesse <HI>Emelias</HI> beauty, to his great honor and renowne, hee remained a while in the <HI>French</HI> Court greatly feasted: where for a time he stayed with him the two noble <HI>Danes,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> intertaining them with great fa∣miliaritie and kindnesse. But béeing at length weary of idlenesse, and desirous to follow after their quest: they de∣parted towards <HI>Belgica,</HI> being earnestly intreated by the <HI>English</HI> Prince to haue accompaned him into <HI>England.</HI> Thus departed they onwards on their iourny, still making diligent inquiry after their King, of whom, nor of Sir <HI>Gwaltero</HI> they could learne any certainty. In this manner rode they together, through most part of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> leauing behind them in all places, a famous memoriall of their ver∣tuous acts: which caused their names to bée spred farre and néere. But at length, passing the spacious Kingdome of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> they arriued in the vnfortunate Dukedome of <HI>Holland:</HI> infortunate in regard of y<SUP>e</SUP> many vilde customes erected, by the tirrany of their vngodly Duke: as is in the first part of this History declared.</P>
<P>Scarce were they entred one whole daies iourny with∣in this prouince, before that Fame, the Herault of reports, had brought vnto their eares, the custome of the Castle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> with the many famous explots there exercised, with the innumerable number of Knights, which had there
<PB REF="55"/> lost themselues: among whom there was one Knight for his excéeding vallor, farre famoused aboue the rest, who by the description of body and Armes which he bare, they pre∣sently imagined to be the Lord <HI>Gwaltero.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore determining either to recouer him, or loose themselues, they set on thetherwards, where the next mor∣ning they arriued so me two houres before that <HI>Phoebus</HI> vntired stéedes, with their neuer resting Chariot, had at∣tained the mid heauens: and comming within the view of the Castle, the strength thereof strake a sudden amazednesse in them: but considering the cause of their comming, was to deliuer him whom they intirely loued, and also that to a valiant hart, nothing should séeme difficult, and withal, the harder the enterprise, the more is the honor obtained by the victor: they determined rather to die, then to returne not making triall of the aduenture being sonéere, which would be for euer a great dishonor vnto thē. The Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> desiring to make the first triall, whereunto Sir <HI>Henault</HI> willingly consented, hoping that if hee were ouercome, his honor in obtaining the victory would be the greater.</P>
<P>Thus being agréed, tthe Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> went presently vnto the shield, giuing it such a blow that he cleft it in two in the midst, which beeing séene by those that garded the bridge, immediately one of them arming himselfe, came foorth mounted on a mighty stéede, of a browne bay cul∣lour, with a little white starre in the forehead, and one white foote: and comming with an easie trot vnto the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> demaunded of him wherefore he sought, and what was the occasion of his so outragious striking of the shield. The Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> aunswered, that his comming thether was to séeke for a Knight, which bare in his shield two Lions rampant sable, in a féeld argent, who as he vn∣derstood, had béene by treason subdued and imprisoned within that Castle, and for the striking of the shield, hée listed not to giue him any other reason, then that he hoped with y<SUP>e</SUP> fame Launce, to pierce both his shield and his hart. The other replied, that such a Knight indéede was there
<PB REF="55"/> imprisoned, whose hauty hart, caused him attempt that which he could not accomplish: in pursuing whereof, by force and not by treason he was vanquished, and according to the custome of their Castle, made forfeiture of his life, but that for his vallor, they were contented hee should a while liue to helpe to strengthen their gard, if hee could thereto be wonne. Then turning about his horse, they both prepa∣red to fetch their carrere: and placing their staues in their rests, they met together so rudely, that the Knight of the bridge was sent to measure his length on the ground, being mortally wounded with a splinter of the Launce in the vi∣sage, the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> likewise, beeing so sore shaken with y<SUP>e</SUP> incounter, as he had much to doe to kéepe his Sad∣dle: then presently came foorth other two Knights, well armed, and mounted, crying to him to prepare himselfe to incounter them: which he presently did, and méeting toge∣ther, strake one of them so stronge a blow, that missing to∣ward it with his shield, his Launce passed cleane through his body: but the other Knight, breaking his Launce in the midst of his shield, caused him to tumble ouer his horse taile, but it was not long before such time as he had recoue∣red his féete, his Squire beeing ready with the horse of the first Knight, on which he presently mounted, and drawing foorth his sword, was presently ready to assault the other, who séeing him dismounted, made no great hast, but with vaine glorious brauery, passed on his carrere, when tur∣ning about and perceauing him to bee remounted, drew foorth his sword, saying, Sir Knight, well may you thanke your Squire for so quicke puruaying of a new horse for you, but I feare me hee shall but little stéede you against the force of my arme, which hath once already sent you to measure your loutish length vpon the ground.</P>
<P>The Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> being madded with rage, stayed not to aunswere him with words, but with his sword lent him so friendly a blow, that caused him to bend his head e∣uen to his brest: but quickly recouering himselfe againe, he strake the other such ablow, that had hee not warded the
<PB REF="56"/> same with his shield, he had gone néere to haue cleft his head in two: thus continued they a while, sometimes the one, sometimes the other séeming to haue the better, For∣tune so equally guiding the ballance, that it was hard to iudge, whether side should obtaine victory. At last, the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> imagining with himselfe that to be long in con∣quering, would be a cause that himselfe in the end should be ouercome, determined either to obtaine a spéedy conquest, or a spéedy death: wherefore, vniting all his forces toge∣ther, and raising himselfe in his stirrups, hee gaue his e∣nemie such a recombendibus on the head, that the stéele be∣ing of too weake a force to resist y<SUP>e</SUP> weight thereof, gaue frée passage to the sword, which found a ready way to his braines, causing him to fall as dead as a herring vnto the ground.</P>
<P>But before he could haue any space to rest himselfe, or almost to breath, came foorth other two, charging him both at once, and he as gallantly aunswered their charge, recea∣uing both their staues vppon his shield, which caused his horse a little to stagger backwards, but as they passed by, their Launces being brokē, he gaue one of them so sound a stroke on the side of the head, before hée looked for any such matter, that he left him but halfe a face to court his Mistris withall: then prouiding to incounter the other, betwixt whom there passed a fierce and bloody conflict, but in the end the victory remained vnto the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> who al∣though hee were grieuously wounded, yet his hart being not a whit feared or any way dismaied, went forwards vn∣to the bridge, whether Sir <HI>Henault</HI> likewise came, perswa∣ding him to giue ouer the enterprise to him, considering he was so sore hurt, but he that neuer knew what feare was, could not be so lightly perswaded, wherefore desiring Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> if he were ouercome to do his best, he made choice of such parts of armes as he wanted, and taking a stronge Launce, he went forwards towards the end of the bridge, where he was incountred by two of the fiue Knights that kept the same, betwixt whom there was a long and dan∣gerous
<PB REF="56"/> conflict, but in the end, through faintnesse and great losse of blood, the Lord of <HI>Menew</HI> striking a full blow at one of them, sent himselfe after to the ground, his legges be∣ing no longer able to sustaine the weight of his body, yéel∣ding thereby the victory to them, who were not able long to inioy the same: for the one of them euen as he fell, being in as weake estate, strooke likewise at him, and missing his blow, sent the whole burthen of his body to imbrace him in death, whom in life he had persued so deadly. The other likewise being in little better state, seeing his cōpanion fall, thought to helpe him, and stooping downe to lift him vp, fell himselfe likewise into a traunce.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henault</HI> fearing least his companion had béen slaine, went presently to haue taken vp his body, but was hindred by the other thrée Knights: who all at once assaulted him, and being afoote in like sort as he was, there beganne a bloody, though vnequall combat, each party séeking to ouer∣come. Thus fought they a long time, giuing and receauing many wounds: Sir <HI>Henault</HI> giuing such blowes, as well made show he meant to sell his liberty or life at a déere rate: so long they fought, that at length two of them fell dead at his féete, the other séeing his fellowes slaine, thought it more for his liues safety to trust to his legges then his hands, so that turning his backe he ranne towards the Ca∣stle, from whence presently issued, fiue other Knights ar∣med, putting themselues betwéene Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and the runne-away.</P>
<P>Héere againe beganne a more fierce conflict then the for∣mer, by reason they were fiue hardy approoued Knights, and his former battaile hauing serued, but as whetting of his courage, caused him to lay on such blowes, that in short time he had sent two of their soules to séeke passage at <HI>Cha∣rons</HI> ferry: himselfe and the other thrée being greatly wea∣ried, stoode still a while to rest themselues: when Sir <HI>He∣nault</HI> considering with himselfe the cause of his fighting, as to release his noble friend <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and also to be reuen∣ged for the death of the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> hee was so repleat
<PB REF="57"/> with ire, y<SUP>t</SUP> running vpon them as a man inraged, he strooke one of them such a blow, as he seuered his head from his shoulders, then laying on at the other two such mighty blowes, that hee forced them in the end to yéeld vp their soules, as a sacrifice to his sword: which being ended, hée himselfe being-ouer trauelled, and hauing lost great aboun∣dance of blood, sate himselfe downe on a stone, where hée had not long sitten before he fel into aswound, which being séene by the Knights of the Castle, they came foorth and tooke both him, and the body of the Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> with the rest of whom there was any hope of recouery, and car∣ried them into the Castle, where in respect of their vallor, they caused to be carefully attended, and their wounds to be cured: perswading them in the meane time to bee part∣ners w<SUP>t</SUP> them, in garding this their lewd custome. Which when they beeing well, refused, were immediatly put downe into the prison, where the King and <HI>Gwaltero</HI> re∣mained.</P>

Most worthy Knight, not long since there was remaining in this Country, a most vile and wicked Gouernour, na∣med <HI>Querenus,</HI> a man for the detestable wickednes which he liued in, hated both of God and man, for what virgin or beautifull wife was there in this Country, which if hee li∣ked, but he would force to accomplish his lustfull appetite: yea to such a height of euill was he growne, that he neither feared God nor man, knowing no heauen but his worldlie pleasures, nor fearing no other hell but the misery of this life, the which hee continued to the mortall griefe of all his subiects: who in the end, béeing wearied and ouerburthe∣ned in this intollerable miserie, chose rather to end theyr liues spéedily, then continually to be tormented by this blood-thirstie Tyrant. Wherefore gathering themselues together, they made head against the Tyrant, and after a long warre, they preuailed so against him, that he was for∣ced secretly to abandon his Country, and béeing onely ac∣companied with two men, taking a small boate, which hée found ready prouided, fled away to the Sea, where hauing béen some fixe dayes, at last was put a shore in an Iland, not farre distant hence, where in times past, the excellent and famous Magitian <HI>Bardus</HI> sometimes dwelt, where be∣ing landed, and calling to minde the estate which hee now was brought into, determined there to take vp his habitati∣on, and to preuent both himselfe and his company, from a∣ny hope or desire to escape, immediatly suncke the boate wherein they had escaped, and afterward, béeing diligently searching in a certaine Caue, hapned to find diuers bookes of Magicke, which he tooke great delight in, minding to stu∣die and practise the same. And so mightily profited he there∣in, that in very short time he grew very expert in the same: and at length, growing old, and calling to mind his former life past, and considering the wrong which hee thought he had sustained by his subiects, it caused him to determine how to be reuenged on them, which in this sort he brought
<PB REF="58"/> to passe.</P>
<P>There is in the westermost parts of <HI>America,</HI> a small I∣land very fruitfull, but whether by nature, or by some other accident, or determination of Fortune, onely inhabited by diuers huge and execrable Monsters, there-hence by his de∣uilish Art, did this vngodly <HI>Querenus</HI> cause to be brought the huge monster, which you to your endlesse honour haue so valiantly slaine: and placing him héere, by that meanes thought fully to be reuenged, where by the space of twenty yéeres hee hath now remained, to the vtter ruine and de∣struction of this Country, laying it vtterly wast and deso∣late, hauing deuoured so many Christian bodies, that it grieues my very soule to thinke of, no man before this your comming, euer daring to aduenture himselfe against him, although many times there hath many great companies as∣sembled themselues, to haue assailed him, but comming in∣to his presence, the very sight of him hath put them in such a feare, as not able to indure, they haue béen forced to turne their backs and flie, trusting more to their héeles then their hands, many of them béeing not able to flie so fast as theyr fellowes, where forced to stay behind, &amp; remaine as foode vnto the vgly Monster: but now (God be thanked) by your noble prowesse, brought vnto his end.</P>
<P>The Prince receiued no small admiration heereat, won∣dering that a man should be so wicked, as to reuenge his wrong by so hatefull a meanes. But to bring him out of this his imaginations, the Hermit would discourse with him of diuers other matters, sometimes of one matter, and then of another. And now the Knight hauing remained by the space of tenne dayes in the Hermitage, he was indiffe∣rent wel recouered, during which time he was many times visited by his owne company, and also by the inhabitants of the Country, which came daily to sée him. For by this time had Fame so spred abroade his hautie exployt, that there came many from diuers Countries adioyning, offe∣ring themselues, and all that they had to be at his dispositi∣on: but he béeing not minded to stay there longer then that
<PB REF="58"/> his wounds were throughly whole, gaue them thankes for their kind proffer, telling them y<SUP>t</SUP> hee could not accept of the the same, by reason he was to follow a certaine earnest ad∣uenture which he was in quest of. Thus passing away the time vntill he was fully whole, the day before he meant to depart towards his ship, the old Hermit being in talk with him, told him of a certaine aduenture not farre of, which in his younger yéeres, he did remember to haue séene many to make tryall thereof, but neuer heard of any to haue attai∣ned the accomplishment of the same.</P>
<P>The Knight béeing desirous to know the same, desired the Hermit to declare it vnto him, which he did in this ma∣ner. Not far hence (quoth he) there standeth a small Chap∣pell, situate at the foote of an hill, nowe altogether ouer∣growne with bryers and bushes, by reason of the Monsters crueltie, which lately to your eternall renowne, you so fa∣mously haue vanquished and slaine: in former time this Chappell was dedicated to the diuine seruice of GOD, by the renowned King <HI>Flintus,</HI> Prince of the Brittons, in the time that the Romans ruled héere with their mighty Legi∣ons, and afterwards beautified and adorned by y<SUP>e</SUP> famous Prince <HI>Lionell</HI> his sonne, with many sumptious and costlie ornaments. In the midst of which a little before his death, he caused his owne Armor, being one of the best in y<SUP>e</SUP> world, and with which hee had accomplished many excellent at∣chieuements, to be hanged vp there, to be kept for his eter∣nall memory. Where it remained a great while vntouched of any, onely through the priuiledge of the place, vntill the time of the famous <HI>Arthur,</HI> at which time y<SUP>e</SUP> excellent Magi∣tian <HI>Merlin</HI> knowing that there would be many, which not respecting the sinne of sacriledge, would not stick to take a∣way so precious a Iewell as was the same, cast foorthwith so mighty an inchauntment on the Armor, that none but such a one, who in his time should excell all others, both in valour, curtesie and loyaltie, should be able to take downe the same.</P>
<P>Now not long after, according to his imagination it fell
<PB REF="59"/> out, for many béeing desirous to obtaine so good an Armor, made tryall to take the same away, but hetherunto there was no man so hardy, as once to moue it. Wherfore I am fully perswaded, that it was ordained onely for you, in whom I may boldly say, remaines the greatest vallor and magnanimitie, that may be possible in any Knight now li∣uing, as already your déedes haue manifested. The prince thanking him for his vndeserued prayses, attributing them rather to his loue and affection towards him, then for any merrite he knew in himselfe worthy the least of them: with∣all desiring the good olde man, to accompany him thether, where he would likewise make triall of his fortune, as ma∣ny others had doone before him, albeit he had no hope to at∣taine that, which so many good Knights had failed of.</P>
<P>Thus departing from the Hermitage, they went the next way towards the Chappell, where they arriued about the time they were wont to sing their euening Masse there, at their comming they found it desolate, the doores &amp; win∣dowes ouer-growne with bryers and nettles, the walls ruinous, and all things else growne into decay, which cau∣sed not onely the auncient Hermit, but also the whole com∣pany to shed teares from theyr eyes. Then at the request of the Prince, the Hermit sang Euen song vnto them, which had not béen heard there in twenty yéeres before.</P>
<P>Theyr prayers béeing ended, they went vp in a small Ile of the Chappell, where hung the foresaid Armor, with diuers other Reliques, which hee beheld, with a great de∣sire to inioy the same: then lifting vp his eyes to heauen, imploring God to be his ayde, he stretched foorth his hand to take them downe from their place; which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without any paine at all, to the no small admiration of the behol∣ders. Then pulling of his owne Armor, he armed himselfe with this which he had gotten, which fitted him so well, as if it purposely had béene made for him. The Armor was of a greene cullour, representing a fielde full of Orenge trees bearing fruite, some fallen, some ripe as ready to fall, and some againe gréene, as but now budding, which wrought
<PB REF="59"/> such a content vnto the Princes minde, as not any thing might be greater. The shield also he tooke on his arme, and although it was impersable, yet was it framed of such a substance, that it was as light as any ordinary shield, the deuice béeing in a fielde <HI>Verte,</HI> thrée Lyons rampant, or signifying indéede, thrée Lyons which the famous <HI>Lyonell</HI> slew in the Kingdome of <HI>Spayne,</HI> as you may reade in that History, and from which likewise hee was called <HI>Lyon∣queller.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. How the Prince <HI>Euordanus</HI> departing out of <HI>Walles,</HI> arriued in <HI>Ireland,</HI> naming himselfe <HI>the Knight of the Lyons,</HI> and what hapned vnto him on his way towards <HI>Dublin.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Prince hauing throughly recouered him selfe of his wounds which he receiued of the Monster, and hauing gained the Armor and shielde of the famous <HI>Lionell,</HI> departed to∣wards y<SUP>e</SUP> harbor of <HI>Milford,</HI> taking his leaue of the courtious Hermise, and the rest of the inhabitants of the Country: many of whome were desirous to haue kept him company, but he would not in any wise accept thereof. And now being come vnto the harbor, he found his shippe in a readinesse, and hauing the wind indifferent faire, they set saile towards <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the next day they arriued in the famous Riuer of <HI>Waterford:</HI> where beeing come to an ancor, they went on shore to view the pleasantnesse of the Country.</P>
<P>Which at that time was indifferent delightfull, by rea∣son of the many pleasant springs, which descended from the Mountaines, causing with their rumbling noise a most de∣lightfull harmony. The next day the Prince accompanied only with his owne Squire, and the Squire of <HI>Lenarda,</HI> whom hee willed in any wise not to make him knowne, otherwise thenby the name of the Knight of the Lions. De∣parted towards the Citty of <HI>Dublin,</HI> whereas <HI>Adresto</HI> re∣mained,
<PB REF="60"/> in the delightfull companie of <HI>Valeria,</HI> for so was the Merchants daughter named, of whom he was so great∣ly enamored, and for whose sake he accomplished diuers and sundry combats, defending her beauty against al com∣mers, to his no small fame and renowne: for that within the space of two yeares he had ouer-come and subdued, a∣boue a thousand Knights, not at any time himselfe hauing receaued the foyle.</P>
<P>Thetherwards rode the Knight of the Lyons, coasting ouer Mountaines and Vallies: the first day not hapning on any aduenture worth the recitall. The next day in the morning, a little after hee was departed from the place whereas they had line that night, there met him a Damsell, mounted on a small hackny, making meruailous hast, and comming vnto him, casting her selfe from her horse to the ground, spake in this manner. Most courtious and valiant Knight, for so much my minde assureth you to bee: let the humble petition of the most distressed Damsell in the world, mooue your nohle hart to pittie and relieue this my cruell disaster, which without the ayde of you or some other valiant Knight is now vncurable, wherefore by your so∣lemne oath of Knight-hood, by which you are bound to de∣fend all distressed persons, especially Ladies and Dam∣sels, and also by her whom you loue most, I coniure you, to ayde and defend me in a most right and iust quarrell.</P>
<P>The Knight beholding her wofull iesture, with her so∣lemne coniurations, which she vttered with such aboun∣dance of sighes, and teares flowing downe from the foun∣taines of her eyes, as might haue mooued the hardest hart to relent, caused her to stand vp, and willed her to declare the effect and cause of this her complaint, assuring her, that if her cause were corespondent to her sorrowes, she had met with one who would either loose his life, or worke her con∣tent. The Damsell béeing comforted with this his pro∣mise, rose vp from the ground, and wiping the teares from her eyes, began thus. Most woorthy Knight, know that not passing fiue leagues hence, there dwelt sometimes a fa∣mous
<PB REF="60"/> &amp; valiant Knight, who in the flowre of his age proo∣ued still fortunate in all his enterprises, especially in his loue towards a noble Dame of this Country, named <HI>Mo∣lenda,</HI> whom at length by the consent of theyr friends hee inioyed in lawfull marriage, and liued together a long time in great ioy and content: and in their latter yéeres GOD blessed them with a faire daughter, whom they named <HI>Mo∣desta,</HI> happy in that shee was discended from so vertuous Parents, but afterward most infortunate, as by the pro∣cesse of my spéeches you shall vnderstand. For <HI>Eugenius,</HI> (for so was the auncient Knight my father called) béeing striken in yéeres, &amp; hauing no more children but my selfe, who then had attained vnto the age of twelue yéeres, my Father (as I haue before sayd) béeing striken in age, and also grieuously vexed with an extreame malady, called vn∣to him my mother and my selfe, and after some fatherly ex∣hortations to me giuen, he turned vnto my mother &amp; sayd.</P>
<P>My déere and most beloued <HI>Molenda,</HI> knowing that my fatall time is at hand, and that death, who spareth no man, hath already seased on my body, I haue thought good be∣fore my death, to recommend this our daughter vnto your most louing and motherly care, desiring you in any case, not to permit or suffer her, béeing come vnto ripenesse of yéeres, to match with any of this Prouince, which vnto my soule would be most grieuous: and y<SUP>t</SUP> during her nonage, you would sée her most carefully instructed in vertue, wher∣by she may be worthy of this patrimony whereunto shee is borne. My father hauing vttered these or such like spéeches, and finding himselfe to draw towards his end, imbraced vs both in his armes, and turning about his face, immedi∣atly departed out of this wretched world, leauing vs to be∣waile this our crosse fortunes. Now after wee had solem∣nised his funeralls, and had according to the vse of thys Country, by the space of one whole yéere, in mournfull at∣tire bewailed his death: it hapned on a time, that my mo∣ther béeing desirous to recreate her ouer-troubled minde, with some delightfull pleasures, desired a great number of
<PB REF="61"/> her neighbours, as well Knights, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Damsels, as also others of meaner sort, to come vnto her Castle, where they were all hartily welcome, and worthily feasted by the space of thrée dayes, during which space, they past away the time with many sundry disports, to the con∣tent of vs all.</P>
<P>But alas héere began the head or spring of all my griefe, as by the sequell of my spéeches you shall perceiue, for a∣mongst this company, there was a Knight whose liueli∣hood ioyned with ours, a man indued with rites sufficient, had the Gods graced him so well with vertue and good con∣ditions. This Knight, I say, fayning himselfe to be atta∣ched with my beauty, desired mee of my mother in marri∣age. But she respecting more the riches of the mind, then the worldly wealth of the man, gaue him a flat deniall, al∣leaging my youth to be such, as was very vnfit for a hus∣band: and that to match a young gerle without a setled affection, was the next way to leade her into a life farre worse then death: for then to be matched where one cannot loue, there is on earth no greater torment.</P>
<P>Hée taking this deniall in very ill part, departed vnto his owne Castle, béeing not passing thrée leagues of, where hée remained awhile, contemplating reuenge in his hart, and deuising by what meanes he might accomplish the same, at last determined to winne y<SUP>t</SUP> by force, which by fayre means he could not hope to attaine. And béeing setled in this reso∣lution, he gathered together the greatest forces y<SUP>t</SUP> hee could: and within a month after, no one suspecting such villanie, in the night time most trayterously assaulted our Castle, where hauing gotten the possession thereof, slew all those who made any resistance against him. And taking my mo∣ther in her Chamber, threatned her with she like crueltie as hee had shewed vnto the rest, if foorthwith shée did not giue me her wofull daughter, to be his Concubine: for now hauing gotten our possessions by force, he disdained to haue me to his wife, which I béeing in the next réeme and hea∣ring, immediatly threw my selfe out at a window, where
<PB REF="61"/> by chance faling to the ground without any great hurt, I found his Palfry ready tide, on which foorthwith I moun∣ted, flying away as fast as I could, neuer staying in any place, vntill now méeting with you, of whom I hope to re∣ceiue helpe and comfort.</P>
<P>Hare she stayed her spéeches, pouring foorth abundance of teares, which caused the young Knight greatly to pittie her: vowing vnto her, if that they remained his comming, he would so punish theyr detestable treasons, as should be both to her content, and also an example to all those, who should afterward attempt the like. And willing her to leade on the way, they rode onwards most part of the day, not méeting with any one till euening, about the time that <HI>Ve∣sperus</HI> appearing in the West, gaue them warning to take vp theyr lodging, which forthwith they did: for comming into a little thicke wood, and the Sky waxing dark, where∣by they feared to misse theyr way, they layde themselues downe vnder a thicke tuffe of trées, where after they had refreshed themselues, with such viands as his Squire had brought with him, they betooke themselues to sléepe, the Prince not so much as putting off his Helme, for feare least they might be set on in their sléepe: and hee also appointed the two Squires to watch by turne, so much did his mind misdoubt the wickednes of those people, who inhabited thereabouts, giuen onely to rapine and theft.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Howe the Knight of the Lyons sleeping in a wood, was set on by a company of thieues: and after, how hee came to the Castle of the wofull Lady <HI>Molenda,</HI> where hee slewe the traytor <HI>Calepin.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Knight béeing accompanied with his two Squires, and the Damsell, had scarcely slept vntill midnight, when his Squire, whose turne was to watch, gaue him notice that hee did heare a noyse not farre off, which hee did
<PB REF="62"/> iudge to be of some company comming towards them. The Prince, immediatly taking his shielde on his arme, &amp; put∣ting himselfe in a readines, commaunded them to lie still, fayning themselues to sléepe, which they did, when present∣ly they beheld tenne thieues armed with swords and other weapons, who comming néere them, conferred amongst themselues, whether it were best to kill them as they slept, or else to set vpon them, and hauing bound them, to robbe thē of that they had: which when the Knight heard he im∣mediatly start vp, and taking his sword in his hand, ranne vpon them, where the first he met with he sent to <HI>Pluto</HI> his kingdome, to giue an account of his wicked life: his fel∣lowes beholding his mishap, layde on with all theyr forces, vowing to be reuenged for his death, whom soone after they did accompanie: for the Knight béeing both strong, and al∣so well armed with the Armor of Sir <HI>Lionell,</HI> made no ac∣count of theyr blowes, which to him did no more hurt then if they had layd on theyr blowes vppon some flintie Rocke. Thus continued the fight by the space of an houre, in which time he had dispatched sixe of them: the others thinking to saue themselues by flight, were stayed by the two Squires, who slew one of them out-right, the others falling on theyr knees desired pardon, which the Knight forthwith granted them, causing thē to sweare to giue ouer that kinde of life, which they did: the one of them being something striken in yéeres, betooke himselfe afterwards to a Hermitage, where hee spent the rest of his life in prayer, and bewailing of his sinnes, an other intreated him to accept of him as his slaue, which the Prince was the more willing to doe, in regard that hee should serue him as a guide, during his trauell in that Country, which vnto a stranger is very perrilous.</P>
<P>And truly afterwards he did not repent the sauing of his life, for that he did him good seruice, as you shall reade in the sequell of the History. After this conflict, the Knight and his company remained all the remnant of the night discour∣sing of many matters, in which the théefe declared vnto him the fashion of the Country, which vnto the Knight sée∣med
<PB REF="62"/> very strange. Now beautifull <HI>Aurora</HI> hauing chan∣ged her mourning wéede, and cladde herself in her richest robes, to welcom her déere beloued bridegroome the sunne, the Knight of the Lyons with his company mounted on horsebacke, all sauing his newe entertained seruaunt <HI>Gil∣limo,</HI> for so was the théefe called whom he had receiued into his seruice: and taking his néerest way to the Castle of <HI>Mo∣lenda,</HI> they trauelled on vntill it was about nine of y<SUP>e</SUP> clock, at what time they arriued there, (euen as <HI>Callapin</HI> hauing rifled the same, was ready to depart, causing two of his companions to dreg the good old Lady by the hayre, mind∣ing to carry her vnto a Castle of his, where shee should re∣maine prisoner, vntill such time as shee should deliuer her daughter, with the whole inhearitance into his custodie,) which when the Knight of the Lyons beheld, he set spurres vnto his horse, and hauing almost ouertaken them, said, Stay villaines, and declare wherefore you vse that Ladie in such vile sort, or else you shall déerely abide it. <HI>Callapin</HI> turning about, and séeing but one Knight pursuing them, sayd, I list not to declare the cause vnto thée, but if thou get thée not packing, my Launce shall teach thée the guerdon due for thy too much ouer boldnes. Then placing theyr staues in theyr rests, they ranne one against the other with all their forces, and méeting together, theyr incounter was so furious, that <HI>Callapin</HI> was throwne to the ground being verie sore brused with the fall. The other passed on halfe astonished, as neuer hauing receiued the like buffet. Then turning about his horse with his sword drawne, he rode to∣wards <HI>Callapin,</HI> who by this time had recouered his féete, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, dismounted himselfe, deliuering his horse vnto <HI>Gillimo,</HI> who by this time was come vnto them: héere began a most dangerous and fierce foote combat, for <HI>Callapin</HI> was one of the best Knights in all <HI>Ireland,</HI> and knew well how to defend him∣selfe, but yet farre vnequall to the other: who pursued him with so many huge &amp; weighty blowes, breaking his shield and Armor in péeces, that he caused the blood to issue foorth
<PB REF="63"/> abundantly: himselfe through the goodnes of his Armour not hauing receiued any wound, so that it manifestly ap∣peared, which way the victory would bend it selfe: had it not béene that the rest of <HI>Callapins</HI> company, (who percei∣ued him almost ouercome) put themselues in his defence: Héere againe the battell began to grow doubtfull, they bée∣ing eyght, and all on horsebacke, whereby they had the far greater aduantage: which the good Knight perceiuing, and séeing there was no way to auoyde this danger but by his owne prowesse, gaue <HI>Callapin</HI> so sound a blow on the head, that cleauing both Helme and head to the téeth, caused him to fall dead to the ground: and making as if he would haue fled, hee came to <HI>Gillimo,</HI> and mounting himselfe on horse∣back, he incountred one of them, who breaking his staffe on his good shield, was sent besides his saddle to measure his length on the ground, where to make him sure for dooing a∣ny further harme, <HI>Gillimo</HI> tooke paynes to cut off his head. But now was the other seauen come vnto him, who all at once charged him with their Launces, in such sort, that his horse not béeing able to indure the incounter, fel vnder him, but soone was hée againe remounted by his Squire, who brought him <HI>Callapins</HI> horse, then began hee to lay on such blowes, as well he gaue them to vnderstand, y<SUP>t</SUP> they could not long indure against him, frō some cutting their armes from their bodies, ouerthrowing others to the ground, who neuer could rise againe, for that the two Squires and <HI>Gil∣limo</HI> made them safe, by cutting their throats: thus conti∣nued the battell two long howres, the Knight of the Lyons neuer hauing leisure to breathe himselfe, so obstinate were they in the séeking of theyr owne deaths: which by thys time sixe of them had gained: the other two, séeing theyr fellowes all slaine, betooke thēselues to flight, hoping there∣by to saue theyr liues, but béeing pursued by the Knight, they were soone ouertaken, leauing theyr liues for a satis∣faction of theyr former offences. Which when <HI>Molenda</HI> perceiued, with her Daughter, who by this time was come vnto her, cast themselues at his féete, and gaue him
<PB REF="63"/> most hartie thankes for theyr deliuery, proffering him all that they had, if hée would accept thereof. But hee raysing them from the ground, willed them to render thankes to GOD, who had sent him as a scourge to punish such wicked offenders, as were those whom hee had vanqui∣shed.</P>
<P>Then taking theyr way into the Castle, they remained there all that night, where they were feasted by the Mo∣ther and the Daughter, who séeing him so young and beau∣tifull, admired how he could be of such force, to effect such déedes as hee had brought to passe: therefore desiring to know what hee was, <HI>Molenda</HI> beganne in this sort: Most valiant Knight, séeing you will not receiue any thing of vs, whereby we might manifest vnto you the thankfulnes of our mindes, yet I beséech you let vs know vnto whom we are so much bounden, whereby in our prayers we may record this your memorable action. The Knight aunswe∣red, As for that you demaund, I cannot satisfie you, be∣cause I know not mine owne estate, but where I am knowne, I am called the Knight of the Lyons, by reason of these Lyons which I beare on my shield. Farther they would haue questioned with him, but fearing to displease him, they gaue ouer: and hauing brought him vnto his Chamber, they committed him to GOD, where that night, by reason of his extreame wearinesse, and his wat∣ching the night before, hée slept very soundly.</P>
<P>Where wée will leaue him awhile, and returne to de∣clare what hapned in the meane time to Prince <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> whom you may remember in the former part of this History, intended to demaund the beautifull Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> of her Father the King of <HI>Fraunce.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is declared in the first part of this history, how that Prince <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> being in the <HI>French</HI> Court, where he ouercame the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and after maintai∣ned the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> to be the beauti∣fullest Lady in the world, of whom hee grew so farre in∣amoured, that hee determined to demaunde her of the King her father. Wherefore one day being in a melan∣cholly humor, walking in a delightfull garden, ioyning to the Pallace to recreate himselfe, the King likewise came thether, being accompanied with one page only, and fin∣ding the Prince somewhat pensiue, demaunded the cause thereof: to which he replied. The cause of this my dumpes, in which you say I now am in, procéedes partly from your selfe, in regard I feare your deniall in a matter, for which I minde to be a suter vnto you: which feare driues me in∣to a doubt, whether I were best to speake in the same, fea∣ring to bee denayd, or else conceals the same to my selfe, which likewise may bréede a farther danger.</P>
<P>The King a while studying with himselfe, what the matter might be, at length gaue him this aunswere. Most noble Prince, the loue which I bare vnto you is such, that it causeth me not to dissemble with you, wherefore knowe that I cannot chuse but take these your spéeches, in very vnkind part, howsoeuer by you spoken: for if the matter be reasonable which you would request, then how farre you wrong mee in doubting my consent therein, I referre to God only, who knowes the thoughts of my hart. If vnrea∣sonable, to your selfe, who knowes what it is from ones friend to expect those things, which hee cannot well with∣out
<PB REF="64"/> his great preiudice graunt: wherefore declare boldly what it is that troubles your minde, and assure your selfe, you shall finde me willing to satisfie you therein, if it bée not greatly to the preiudice of my honor, and state of this my Kingdome. The Prince hearing this friendly, and to him ioyfull conclusion: replied, that he did greatly thanke his Maiestie, for that great loue which hee did assure him of: wherefore now putting all feare and doubte aside, hée would declare the same vnto him, which was this: that be∣ing greatly wounded with the vertues, and beauty of the Princesse <HI>Emilia</HI> his daughter, whom in hart he had vow∣ed to loue, and fearing least he had otherwise disposed of her, indéede was the cause of his pensiuenesse.</P>
<P>Which when the King heard, with a smiling counten∣ance made him this aunswere: and is it possible, that beau∣tie can cause such alteration in you, or else that loue can so soone take possession of your hart, as comming frée to this my Court, where you haue scarcely remained one month: but indéede your combat with the Duke our Cosin, and af∣ter hazarding your selfe in the same Challenge, did cause me, in sort to imagine, that you were somewhat intangled in those nets.</P>
<P>But now to the purpose, as she is my daughter, so doe I thinke shee will not make her choise without my consent, neither I being her father, will force her consent where she doth not loue, but if by faire meanes shee may be wonne héereunto, assure your selfe, that the house of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> is most willing to linke it selfe in loue and amitie with the Prince of <HI>England,</HI> whose noble vallour, deserues to bée highly had in estimation.</P>
<P>The Prince for this his kinde graunt, would néedes haue kist his royall hands, which the King would not suf∣fer him to doe, but imbracing him in his armes, departed immediately into the Pallace, and com∣ming into the Queenes chamber of presence, called for the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> and willing all saue the Quéene, and her to a voyd the presence, hee demaunded of her, whether
<PB REF="65"/> there were any loue betwéene her and the <HI>English</HI> Prince: at which demaunde, she dying her Princely chéekes with a maidenly blush, and falling on her knées, aunswered. Most gracious father, considering that in concealing the truth from you, being therof demaunded, I shall not only breake the bounds of duty by being disobedient, but also offende God in making of a lie: know therefore, that since the day wherein he ouercame the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> I haue so in∣tangled my selfe in his loue, which before being by him sued vnto I made scorne of, that I can finde no way to alter the same, but by death only, which rather then it should be to your dislike, I would willingly indure were it neuere so cruell.</P>
<P>The King beeing ioyfull héereat, yet séeming to be dis∣contented, said: In faith and is it possible, that thou most fond and foolish gearle, shouldest so much forget the bounds of dutie and vertue, as without my consent, so to settle thy fancie on a stranger: but I doubt not but thou wilt as soone repent thy choise, as thou hast forgotten thy duty in choosing, for who knowes whether he being a young amo∣rous Prince, hath not made some other choise already, where then are thy hopes, or what will become of thy loue. The Princesse hearing her father in these tearmes, knewe not well what aunswere to make, but at length with teares in her eies, and fetching a déepe sigh from her hart, shée be∣sought him to consider she force and power of loue, which was of such might, that who most sought to striue against it, was the more cruelly therewith in the end wounded: and that as yet her loue being knowne to none, séeing it so greatly disliked his Maiestie, she would for euer kéepe close, although it did cost her, her life: which shée was sure it would doe, séeing it had taken already such déepe rooting in her hart. The King séeing her constancie, &amp; loth to grieue her any farther, tooke her by the arme, &amp; raising her from the ground, bid her to be of good comfort, for séeing that her affection procéeded from vertue, and not of any wanton or lustfull appetite, hee did both alowe of it, and yéeld consent
<PB REF="65"/> vnto the choise which she had made, willing her farther, to estéeme of the Prince, as one who not only déerely loued her, but also was worthy to be beloued, both for his vallor &amp; magnanimitie of mind, of the greatest Lady in Christen∣dome.</P>
<P>Thus leauing her not a little comforted, he went to im∣part the same to the Prince, vnto whom this newes was more welcome, then to haue béene made Lord of the grea∣ted Kingdome of the world. And taking order with y<SUP>e</SUP> King for the day of their marriage, against which time there should be prepared a great Turny, hee also sent ouer into <HI>England</HI> the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> to certifie the King his fa∣ther héereof, which was to him most welcome newes, bée∣ing now greatly striken in yeares. Also there were many Heraults sent foorth to proclaime this great Turny, which should beheld in the Citty of <HI>Parris,</HI> at the nuptials of the Prince of <HI>England,</HI> and the beautifull <HI>Emelia:</HI> against which time there came daily, many braue and gallant Knights, from diuers Kingdomes, as well Christians as Sarasines: for that the King had graunted by his procla∣mations, a safe conduct for all commers.</P>
<P>Now in this meane time, the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> being throughly recouered of his wounds, which he had receaued against <HI>Don Edward,</HI> and finding that with the losse of his honor, he had likewise lost his loue, grew therewith into so great rage, that he would haue slaine himselfe, had it not béene for some of his seruants, who alwaies gaue dilligent attendance vnto him: and deuising with himselfe on re∣uenge, at last resolued by vnknowne trechery, to bring it thus to passe. There was in this his Dukedome a great Inchaunter, who with his accursed spells, was able in a manner to pull the starres out of their places: to this man the Duke resorted, and making him priuie to his intent, desired him to deuise some meanes how vnknowne hée might be reuenged on the <HI>English</HI> Prince. The Inchaun∣ter willing to showe his loue vnto the Duke, immediately deuised a meane, how not only to be reuenged on y<SUP>e</SUP> prince,
<PB REF="66"/> but also on as many as were welwillers vnto him: which he did bring to passe in this sort. There was in y<SUP>e</SUP> Kingdom of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> some tenne leagues from <HI>Parris</HI> a great For∣rest, in which this Inchaunter by his deuilish art, erected a stately Castle inuironed about with high walls, &amp; déepe ditches, so as it séemed one of the strongest, and fairest Castles of the Kingdome: likewise he inchaunted it in such sort, that though a thousand Knights had sought for it, yet notwithstanding there should none haue found the same, but such as they thought should not be of such force, as to conquer the gardants, who were two fierce &amp; mighty Gy∣ants, farre excéeding the common stature of others of that kind. Also there was a Knight a kinsman of the Dukes, who being accōpanied with 20 or 30 attendants, alwaies remained héerein: the Giants who kept the gard, the one of them was called <HI>Brandofell,</HI> with him first must those Knights haue to doe, that came to make triall of this ad∣uenture, the other was named <HI>Furioll,</HI> excelling in strength all the Giants of his time, to him belonged the combat with those Kinghts, to whom fortune was so fauorable, as to ouercome <HI>Brandofell.</HI> In this manner hauing prouided for the garde of this inchaunted Castle, they deuised a meane by which to bring the Prince vnto the same, which was in this manner. The Inchaunter <HI>Ligustargo,</HI> for so was he called, had a daughter indifferent faire, who in dissimulation was as skilfull, as her father in the art of Ma∣gicke, for she had her teares at commaund, and could so well frame her countenance to sorrowe, that there was none but would haue taken her to be very sorrowe it selfe: to her was referred the meanes to seduce the Prince, who comming vnto the Court, with her haire disperssed about her shoulders, her garments rent and torne, and beeing conducted into the great Hall, she was admired at of eue∣ry one, and greatly pittied, for the outward showe of sor∣rowe, which did séeme so much to afflict her: in this man∣ner being conducted where the King, with many Princes
<PB REF="66"/> and great Lords were sitting togethers, shee demaunded which was the <HI>English</HI> Prince. Who hearing himselfe named, immediately stept foorth, demaunding what shée would with him: shee presently falling on her knees, fet∣ching many vehement and déepe sighes, powring foorth such aboundance of teares, as a while detained the passage of her spéech, which caused great pitty in all the beholders, but especially in the Prince, who naturally was very pit∣tifull: at length hauing recouered the vse of her tongue, with a déepe sigh procéeded in this manner. Most worthy and valerous Prince, if the teares of the most distressed and wofullest creature in the world, may mooue pitty and com∣passion, in your heroyick and noble minde, then let these my complaints haue accesse vnto your vertuous hart, which I haue heard reported to be such, that causeth me ra∣ther then vnto any other of these noble Knights, to make my complaint, hoping by you to receaue some comfort in this my great heauinesse, which hapned in this manner. Being sent by the beautifull Dutches <HI>Gelnarda,</HI> Dutches of <HI>Strauonia</HI> vnto a friend of hers, whose fame peraduen∣ture you haue héeretofore heard of, called <HI>Segando,</HI> who now remaines in the Kingdome of <HI>Island,</HI> in the company of a beautifull Damsell, cleane forgetting both my Lady and her loue, which héeretofore to him was esteemed most déere, my Lady hauing made diuers trialls for recouering of him, now as her last refuge sent mee vnto him with a packet of letters, &amp; a ring which was of such vertue, that he should no sooner haue put the same on his finger, but hée should presently be so ouercome with her loue, y<SUP>t</SUP> he should not be able to rest quiet, vntill such time as he were com in∣to her presence. And now hauing trauelled through most part of <HI>Italie,</HI> and comming into this Kingdome, not passing tenne leagues from this Citty, comming through a For∣rest, I was taken by almighty Giant, to me most fearefull, who after hee had taken from mee the casket with diuers Iewells that I had, he returned into a Caue from whence he came: this my Lord is the cause of my griefe, and like∣wise
<PB REF="67"/> will bee the death of the most gentlest Lady liuing, if you, or some other noble Knight take not pitty vpon vs, by slaying that vgly Giant, whereby I may regaine the ring: héere againe powred shee foorth such aboundance of teares, as if her eyes had béene a fountaine, or liuely velspring, intermedling y<SUP>e</SUP> same with so many déepe sighes, as would haue mooued a flinty hart to compassion: much more then thinke you did it mooue the <HI>English</HI> Prince, who willing her to be of good comfort, promised her that either he would worke her content, or loose himselfe in aduenturing the same: for which with a demure and sad countenance shée yéelded him harty thankes. What followed héereof you shall reade in the Chapter following.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. How the Prince <HI>Don Edward</HI> departed from the Court, with the sorrowfull Damsell, and how comming into the For∣rest, he fought with the Giant <HI>Brandofell,</HI> and how he was taken prisoner, for whose mishap there was made great sorrow in the Court.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Prince hauing promised helpe and succour, to that vilde counterfet Damsell, tooke order y<SUP>e</SUP> next day to depart towards the Forrest: in the meane time, com∣ming vp into y<SUP>e</SUP> Princesse <HI>Emelias</HI> cham∣ber, and falling into discourse with her of this his intended iourny, from which she greatly disswaded him, her minde foretelling, the great damage which hée should sustaine thereby: but no disswations could preuaile with him héerein, so earnest was he bent to follow this his crosse fortune, appointed to him by destenie: but after long spéeches betwéene them of this and other matters, they fell from talke to dalliance, so that of a beautifull maiden, the Princesse became the fairest woman in all <HI>Fraunce,</HI> at which time she was conceaued of two goodly children, as you shall reade of héereafter. Now let vs returne to our
<PB REF="67"/> former purpose: the next day, no sooner had the Sunne ri∣sing out of Dame <HI>Thetis</HI> lodging, mounted himselfe on his neuer resting Chariot, but the valerous Prince being accompaned with the Damsell, and one Squire only, for more company he would not accept of, armed at all points sauing his Helme, which his Squire carried by reason of the heate: tooke his iourny towards the vnfortunate For∣rest. Most part of the day rode they onwards, the Dam∣sell for the better hiding of her trechery, declared vnto him a large discourse, of the loue betwéene the Dutches her La∣dy and Mistrisse, and the Knight <HI>Sergando,</HI> with many his valerous and hauty déedes of armes, whereof some part the Prince had heard of, which caused him to giue the more credit to the rest. Thus passed they away all that day, till comming vnto a small village, some two leagues distant from the Forrest, euen about the time, that <HI>Phoebus</HI> with his golden beames, was some thrée degrées discended from y<SUP>e</SUP> Meridian: and because it was too late to combat with the Giant, they determined for that night to take vp their rest, whereby the next day hee might not be altogether wearied with trauell, and also to haue if occasion serued, the lon∣ger time to finish the combat. Thus hauing taken vp their lodgings in a small cottage, they refreshed themselues with such viands as that Country village would afford: and after their repast, betaking themselues to their rest, where the Prince of all the night could scarcely inioy one slumber, till towards the morning cloosing his eyes, he slumbred a∣little, in which hee thought that hee came before a goodly Castle, one of the fairest that euer he beheld, hauing but one entraunce which was at a small wicket, through which it séemed vnto him, he saw very many enter, but none to returne backe againe, at which hee séemed very much to meruaile, and going about to enter, he saw a mighty Gy∣ant comming vnto him, the which sight so amazed him, that foorthwithall he wakened. And blessing himselfe, called his Squire vnto him, and demaunding whether it were day or no, he rose &amp; armed himselfe: then taking a small repast, he
<PB REF="68"/> departed towards the Forrest, where hee arriued by the time that the splendant Sunne with his glistring beames, beganne to light the earth, causing a siluer showe appeare on the face thereof.</P>
<P>Long had hee not rode in this Forrest, (musing verie much what his dreame should meane, sometimes imagi∣ning that it foreshewed some great misaduenture to insue, then wishing his dreame had continued, whereby he might haue had some notice of the end, as well as of the begin∣ning) but the Damsell calling vnto him, told him, that now they were come euen vnto the place where the Gyant had robbed her, &amp; that she doubted he was not farre of. Where∣fore calling for his Helme, and clasping it on, taking his Launce in his hand, behold there appeared before his sight the same Castle, which in his dreame hee thought hee had séene: and casting about his head, he saw cōming towards him a mighty Giant, the greatest of stature that euer he be∣held, mounted on a Courser aunswerable to his weight, which caused the Prince at the first almost to be afraid, yet well considering the vsuall vnlustinesse of those huge mon∣sters, he tooke courage vnto him, minding to doe his vtter∣most to win himselfe immortall fame, by vanquishing so huge a lumpe.</P>
<P>The Giant comming néere vnto him, bidde him prouide himselfe for the Combat, for that without leaue hee was come so néere vnto theyr Castle whereof he was appointed Gardant. The Prince immediatly replied, that séeing hée was by aduenture come thether, and béeing offred y<SUP>e</SUP> com∣bat, which he was sure would bréede him immortall fame, he could doe no lesse then accept therof. Thē setting spurres to their horses, and placing their slaues in their rests, they met together with such furie, that breaking theyr Launces into a thousand shyuers, they mette with theyr bodies like∣wise together so furiously, that they tumbled both horse and men to the ground, béeing both greatly astonied with theyr rude incounter: and rising from the ground, they betooke them to theyr swords, the Giant drawing forth a mightie
<PB REF="68"/> Semiter, as much as another reasonable Knight with one hand was able to lift from the ground: and brandishing the same about his head, began to deliuer many mighty blows at his enemie, which the Prince perceiuing, and fearing greatly to indure the same, not being by force able to with∣stand the same, auoyded them by the quicknes of his body, causing him to spend his might in vaine, and many times did hee both with thrusts and blowes indanger his mightie aduersarie, although his Armor were of pure stéele well∣néere a finger thicke, which the Giant perceiuing, &amp; there∣with growing inraged, hee determined with one blowe to end the conflict, and lifting vp his Semiter aloft, made of∣fer of a blowe, which the Prince thought to take on his shield, hoping to haue giuen him a wound in one of his legs in the meane time, as indéede he did, but the Giant hauing by this meanes a full blow at him, lighted vpon his shield, cleauing it in two peeces, and passing farther, entering through both his Helme and coyse of stéele, wounded him in the head, causing him to réele backwards halfe astonished therewith: but yet recouering himselfe before the Gyant could deliuer another blow, determined with the skilfull Massiue, who béeing once tossed to his dammage, by the horne of the sturdy Bull, minding no more so to indanger himselfe with the like, begins to lie low on the ground, ther∣by hoping both to auoyde his enemies might, and eake to be ready to take the least aduantage when it should be offe∣red: euen so playd the valiant Prince, who to his cost ha∣uing made tryall of his enemies strength, determined no more to hazard himselfe to the like, trusted wholy to the quicknesse of his body, which pollicie serued him to good vse, for thereby he caused the hudge monster, not onely to weary out himselfe, by his multitude of blowes which hee bestowed in vaine, but also many time had the meanes, to giue him diuers great wounds, causing his blood to issue out in such abundant sort, that the gréene grasse was dyed into a vermilion blush, as béeing ashamed, that humane men should haue so little reason, as to séeke the ruine and
<PB REF="69"/> ouerthrow of each other, vpon so small occasion.</P>
<P>Thus continued the fight most part of the day, no one knowing to whom victory would attaine, both of them bée∣ing wounded in many parts of their bodies, especially the Giant, who by reason of the great effusion of blood, which he sustained, began to beare his shielde low, and euen al∣most breathlesse, the Prince béeing in little better case, was contented to suffer him to take breath: and leaning awhile on theyr swords, the Giant told the Prince, that if he would yéeld vnto him, he would cause him to be vsed with y<SUP>e</SUP> grea∣ter lenitie, otherwise, hee should expect nought saue death. To which the Prince made no reply, but willing the Gi∣ant to defend himselfe, they renewed theyr Combat, which continued awhile with great fiercenesse on both sides. But at length, the Giant béeing ouer-wearied, and fainting for want of blood, began againe to giue backe, which the prince perceiuing, and considering that to be long in conquering, would be the meanes that hee himselfe in the end should be vanquished, tooke Time by the front, and pursuing the Giant, gaue him such a blow on the Helme, that it caused him to réele: and before he could recouer himselfe, hee gaue him another, which caused him to fall to the ground. The Prince minding to follow his good fortune, stooped to vn∣lace his Helme, whereby he might haue parted his head frō his shoulders: but héereof hee was hindred by the mightie <HI>Purioll,</HI> who comming vnto him, willed him to giue ouer the vanquished, and to defend himselfe against the force of his arme.</P>
<P>The Prince looking about, and beholding his terrible countenaunce and gesture, began greatly to doubt, consi∣dering that already hee was ouer-wearied with his former Combat: then calling to mind the wordes of the Princesse <HI>Emilia</HI> at his departure, he wisked he had béen ruled by her counsell, which if hee had followed, hee had not fallen into this vnlooked for mischiefe. And now againe casting of all feare, the Giant béeing come néere vnto him, he minded to sell his life and liberty at as déere a rate at he could, deter∣mining
<PB REF="69"/> if he could, to prolong the fight as long as he might, hoping in the end to weary out that Giant, as he had doone <HI>Brandofell,</HI> but héereof he was deceiued, by reason that his wearines, together with his losse of blood, had so taken a∣way the agilitie and quicknes of his body, that he was not able to auoyde the blowes so lightly, but y<SUP>t</SUP> the Giant many times met with him, causing the blood to issue forth in sun∣dry places: and againe, his strength was so diminished, that he could not (if at any time by aduantage hee hapned to strike the Giant) so much as once pierce his massy Ar∣mor. Thus continued they by the space of halfe an howre, the Prince euer receiuing wound vppon wound, vntill at length, béeing altogether wearied with his ouer-long tra∣uell, (as hauing continued in fight from seauen of y<SUP>e</SUP> clocke in the morning, vntill fiue in the afternoone, and hauing lost great aboundance of blood,) gathered all his forces togea∣ther, and minding before hee died, to indamage his enemie what he could, strake at the Giant, which he auoyding, the blow discended to the ground: and the Prince not beeing able to recouer his might, béeing so farre spent, fell there∣with to the ground also in a traunce. Which the Giant be∣holding, and (contrary to his nature) pittying his ouer∣throw, considering the great vallour which he had séene in him, went and pulled off his Helme to giue him ayre, and taking him vppe in his armes, carried him into the Castle, where he was layd on a good bedde, and his wounds care∣fully looked vnto. For Syr <HI>Pestrill,</HI> who vnder the Duke his Cosin was Commaunder of the Castle, was a very vertuous Knight, and one who greatly pittied the Princes captiuity: considering what greefe would thereby rise, both to the King, and all the Nobilitie of <HI>Fraunce.</HI> He also cau∣sed the body of the Giant <HI>Brandofell</HI> to be brought in and cured: whose wounds though they were many and great, yet were there none of them mortall. The Damsell séeing things sort according to her minde, departed away highly contented.</P>
<P>Now returne we to the Princes Squyre, who hauing
<PB REF="70"/> beheld this vnhappy ouer-throw of his Maister, together with his imprisonment, not knowing whether hee were li∣uing or dead, fared like a man out of his wits, and ran ra∣ging vp and downe the Forrest, crying and exclaiming a∣gainst fortune, and the destinies which had permitted such great inuistice: and at length, the morning being come, hée determined to returne vnto the Citty of <HI>Parris,</HI> where the next day he arriued, and comming vnto the King, before him and all the nobles of the Court, hee recounted his Masters misaduenture, together with all that hapned in the battaile with y<SUP>e</SUP> two Giants: which bred such a griefe and amazednesse in all the hearers, as well you may iudge if the like euent should hapen. Euery one determining to hazard their liues, or to set him frée if he liued, all conclu∣ding it to be an inchauntment, knowing that in that place, there was neuer any Castle heard of. But when this newes came to the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> you may well thinke her griefe was not smal, for falling presently into a traunce, her Damsells had much to doe to recouer life in her againe: and being in the end recouered, bursting foorth into bitter exclamations, both against the heauens and powers there∣of, thus continued shee all that night, sounding and re∣sounding in the armes of her Ladies and Gentlewomen: the King her father, and the Quéene vsing all the meanes they could, by perswasions to comfort her. Héere will wée for a while leaue them in this generall lamentation, for the losse of the <HI>English</HI> Prince, euery one making prouision to goe try the same aduenture: and will returne to speake, of the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> of <HI>Saxonie.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. How the Prince of <HI>Saxonie</HI> remaining, discontent in his fa∣thers Court after the departure of <HI>Euordanus:</HI> departed secretly as a Knight arrant, to seeke aduentures.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou may remember how discontented the <HI>Saxon</HI> Prince tooke the departure of his supposed brother, the Gentleman of the Forrest: who hauing séene him aboord, &amp; being againe returned vnto the Court, beganne to waxe so melancholy, that hee séemed to take delight in nothing, although the Duke his father perceauing it, and for remedy for the same, deuised all the meanes he could to worke his content, as by procla∣ming Iusts and turnaments, wherein he héeretofore was wont to receaue great content, and other times hunting of the wilde Boare, and such other exercises, still fearing his departure.</P>
<P>But neither this, nor yet the delightfull company of the Princesse his sister, whom he intirely loued, could in any sort worke him that content, which he was wont to receaue in the company of the Gentleman of the Forrest: whose want, together with the desire of following strange aduen∣tures, wherein he hoped to atchieue immortall renowne, by his valiant and heroick déedes, which hee doubted not but so performe, increased in him such an ardent desire to trauell. Whereof many times being denaied by the Duke his Father, at length hauing resolued with himselfe to de∣part, he called vnto him one of his Squires whom hee in∣tirely loued, and on whose secresie and good seruice, hee more depended then on any other, and declaring vnto him his determination, willed him to prouide for their depar∣ture, which should bee with all the secresie that might bée. His Squire, hauing vnderstoode his Maisters resolution, departed to prouide for the same, and comming to the har∣bor, found a ship ready bound for <HI>England:</HI> and agréeing
<PB REF="71"/> with the maister thereof for their passage, the next night con∣uayed aboord both horse and armor, and such other things as should bee requisite for their iourny: and hauing infor∣med the Prince héereof, the next day, the Prince being ac∣companied only with his Squire, as many times he was accustomed, departed from the Pallace, not suspected of any one, hauing left in his chamber window, a letter written to his father, declaring therein the cause of his depar∣ture. Thus walking a foote, they arriued towards euening at the port where the shippe ancored, and comming aboord, hauing the winde faire, they set saile, directing their course for <HI>Douer,</HI> of which harbor the shippe was. Thus beeing at Sea, and hauing the winde and weather faire, y<SUP>e</SUP> Prince betooke himselfe to sléepe, being with cares ouerwatched, for in thrée nights before he had not slept, so earnest was his minde bent on this his iourny: and now being as hée thought in security from being stopped of his purpose, hée slept soundly, till it was towards the morning, when hée thought there appeared before his sight, y<SUP>e</SUP> beautifullest La∣dy that euer he beheld: who comming vnto him, cast her∣selfe into his armes, desiring his protection against a fierce and vgly Giant, who pursued her. The Prince héerewith awaking, beganne to ponder with himselfe, concerning his dreame, musing what it might signifie, but the beauty and comly grace of the Lady, stucke so fast in his memory, that by no meanes he could put y<SUP>e</SUP> same out of his minde: which caused him in the end, to conclude, that it must néedes bée some Lady, whom the destinies had ordained him to loue, determined to yéeld himselfe prisoner, before the assault should grow too hote: thus continued this amerous young Prince, intangled in her beauty whom he neuer had séene, minding to rest in no place, vntill such time as he had found her out, whom in his dreame he beheld. By this time had they continued at Sea by the space of eight daies, not mée∣ting with any aduenture worth the memory, hauing the winde faire, and the Seas so calme as might bée, till on the ninth day comming almost on shore on y<SUP>e</SUP> caost of <HI>Fraunce,</HI>
<PB REF="71"/> they perceaued a shippe with sailes and ores, as much as they could to make towards them: which the Maister and the rest of the Saylers, presently knewe to be a Pyrat, and calling the Prince vnto them, to knowe what counsell hée would giue in this extremitie, they all beeing minded to yéeld, rather then to fight, considering the vnequalnesse of the match, and the cruelty the Pyrats commonly vsed to those, who made resistance. But the Prince not minding to submit himselfe into the hands of such villaines, gaue them counsell not to yéeld, but to fight it out to y<SUP>e</SUP> last man, and calling for his Armor, immediatly armed himselfe: swearing them all to performe their best indeuours, for to defend themselues.</P>
<P>By this time was the Pirate come vp with them, and warning them to yéelde vnto his mercie, the Prince stand∣ing aloft vppon the decke, with his sword drawne in his hand, &amp; his shield vpon his arme, replied, that they meant to defend themselues, as not béeing accustomed with wordes to be daunted. The Pirat <HI>Geroll</HI> hearing this aunswere, commaunded to grapple with the <HI>English</HI> shyp. The prince at the first incountring with a great lubber, who proffered to leape aboord their shyp, gaue him so sound a blow on the sconte, that it caused him out of the shrowdes to tumble headlong into the Sea, and after him another, and another: so that in the part of the ship where hée was, the fight began to grow excéeding hote, many of the Pirats souldiers bée∣ing gotten aboord, but by the helpe of his Squire, and the Maisters mate, who was a lustie fellow, they quickly clée∣red theyr shippe againe, and the Prince hauing receiued a wound by one of the Pyrats, who was aboord theyr owne shyp, not knowing which way to be reuenged, leapt foorth∣with into theyr shyp, &amp; béeing inraged, laid on such blowes, that euery one thought himselfe happiest when they were farthest from him: for by this time there were slaine aboue twenty of the Pirats. Which <HI>Geroll</HI> perceiuing, &amp; know∣ing right well that if the Knight were slaine, he should easi∣ly vanquish the rest: and hoping to performe it with his
<PB REF="72"/> owne hands, he came stealing behind him, but the Prince who was ordained to finish greater matters, perceiuing his intent, turned his face towards him, giuing him such a sa∣lutation with his sword, that it caused him to bend with one of his knées euen to the deck.</P>
<P>Now began betwéene them two a most cruell Combat, the Pyrat béeing a strong and lustie fellow, &amp; one that had foughten many dangerous battels, and also béeing ayded by those of his partie, assaulted the Prince with great fury, and were as gallantly by him resisted, to theyr no smal pre∣iudice: for within lesse then halfe an howre, hee had slaine sixe of them, wounding y<SUP>e</SUP> rest very grieuously. And by this time the <HI>English</HI> Ship, hauing tackt about, came to the re∣scue of the Prince, which so dismayed the Pyrats, that bée∣ing but tenne of them left aliue, and they for the most part hurt, as before-said, determined to intreate for mercy, and falling downe vpon theyr knées, besought the Prince with one voyce to saue theyr liues: which he easily yéelded vnto. And taking course for the safe custodie of the shyp, they ha∣uing with great deuotion giuen thankes vnto almighty GOD for this so happy victory, which they had so luc∣kily obtained without the losse of any one man, &amp; dressing those that were hurt, with such salues and other néedfull things, whereof they found good store aboord the Pyrat, they directed theyr course for <HI>Douer,</HI> where the next day they safely arriued: where the Prince, at the request of the Ow∣ner of the Ship, stayed by the space of three dayes, during which time, there arriued many of the Country people to behold him: for by this time was his fame spred abroad by the Marriners, to his great renowne. And the Lieuete∣nant that had the gouernment of that Fort vnder the King of <HI>England,</HI> béeing then returned from certaine affayres which he had to doe, entertained him with the greatest ho∣nour that might be. To whom the Prince would not make himselfe knowne, but as a Knight arrant, minding to tra∣uell to the Court of the King of <HI>England,</HI> the fame whereof had brought him from his natiue Country.</P>
<PB REF="72"/>
<P>And now hauing rested himselfe by the space of tenne dayes, for the curing of such wounds as he had receiued in the former conflict, and séeing the Pyrats executed, accor∣ding to the Lawes of that Realme, determined to depart the next day towards <HI>London,</HI> where the King then kept his Court, hauing remained a long time in great pensiue∣nesse for the losse of his sonne Prince <HI>Edward.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Howe <HI>Jago</HI> comming to the English Court, tooke in hand the defence of a Lady falsly accused: and what hapned thereof.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> hauing taken his leaue of the Gouernour of <HI>Douer,</HI> tooke his way directly towards <HI>London,</HI> accompanied onely with his Squire, vnto whom for the more pleasant passing of the time, hee re∣counted his dreame, in a vision which hée had séene at his comming out of <HI>Saxony.</HI> Thus past they away theyr wearisome iourney, till on the fourth day com∣ming within fiue miles of the Citty, they heard one most pittifully wéeping: and drawing somewhat néere the same, there béeing a high banke betwéene them and the voyce which they heard, they stayed awhile to vnderstand the cause of that lamentation. When suddenly they might heare the wéeping cease, and the party to fetch a déepe and grieuous sigh, saying: Is it possible, that God will alto∣gether forsake the distressed innocent, and suffer such great iniustice, not raysing vp any one to helpe or succour theyr rightfull cause against so euident a treason: O y<SUP>t</SUP> it would please him to raise vp another <HI>Daniell,</HI> to find out theyr ac∣cursed forgeries, and to frée this his distressed <HI>Susanna,</HI> or that it would please his almighty power, to indue mée with strength and courage, whereby I might force them to con∣fesse theyr most wrongfull and false accusation, against the most vertuous Lady liuing: but alas, I sée mine own for∣ces,
<PB REF="73"/> béeing a weake and féeble woman, too too far vnable to accomplish the same, and the eares of the Almighty so stopt against my prayers, that he dooth not heare thē. But what doo I meane, so much to blaspheme his holy Name, as to say hée dooth not heare, when alas it is our sinnes which causeth him not to grant what we require: or peraduen∣ture he may deferre the same, to the greater setting forth of his glory: that when all hope is past, euen then hee may shew his omnipotent power by some strange deliuerance. Héere againe she paused.</P>
<P>And <HI>Iago</HI> mounting vp the banke, perceiued that shee was a comely young Gentlewoman, whom hee saluted, and béeing by her againe resaluted, he demaunded y<SUP>e</SUP> cause of her griefe, which by her complaint he imagined to be ve∣ry great: assuring her withall, that if the matter were cor∣respondent vnto truth, and to be tryed by dint of sword, she had met with one, who would willingly hazard his life in defence of the innocent. The Damsell hearing his kind proffer, and withall, viewing the comly proportion of his body, began somewhat to comfort herselfe, hoping y<SUP>t</SUP> God had sent him of purpose, to defend the iust cause of her di∣stressed Lady, answered him. Most curteous and valiant Knight, for so much my mind dooth assure you to be, I ren∣der you infinite thanks for this your kind &amp; willing offer, hoping by the time you haue heard my wofull narration, you will be throughly assured of the equity of the cause, which hath mooued in me, &amp; many more this sorrow, which euen now you found in me, and the vniust and trecherous dealing, of the most disloiallest Knight that liues. Knowe then, that whilst this Court of <HI>England</HI> enioyed their most vallerous Prince <HI>Don Edward,</HI> who now by the space of eyghtéene yeres hath continued imprisoned in an inchaun∣ted Castle in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> did florish with many braue and har∣die Knights, amongst whom there was a noble Gentle∣man, called the Lord <HI>Mowbray,</HI> a man for his vertue and vallor greatly estéemed of all, but especially beloued by the Prince, with whom hee went into <HI>Fraunce,</HI> where by his
<PB REF="73"/> vallor he wonne immortal fame: and after the losse of the Prince, hazarding himselfe for his deliuerance, was like∣wise there taken prisoner. This Lord left behind him at his departure, a sonne and a daughter, his sonne beeing of the age of seauen yéeres, and his daughter called <HI>Beleriza,</HI> of the age of fiue yéeres, both vnder the custody of theyr ver∣tuous and noble Mother: who hauing brought them vp in vertuous and godly liuing, vntill they were of ripe yéeres, departed this world, leauing both her children vnto theyr owne gouernments: <HI>Beleriza</HI> had béene of long time belo∣ued &amp; sued vnto, by a gallant young Knight, named <HI>Fran∣cisco,</HI> whom shée likewise intirely loued, yet minding to prooue his loyaltie, intreated him to goe into <HI>Fraunce,</HI> to combat with the two Giants, <HI>Brandofell</HI> and <HI>Furioll,</HI> who kept the Inchaunted Castle, where the Prince and her fa∣ther, with diuers other famous Knights were imprisoned. <HI>Francisco</HI> willing to haue so fit occasion, both to pleasure his Lady and Mistrisse, and also to showe foorth his vallor, which he thought euen vnmatchable, presently consented, promising to worke wounders, and so fitting himselfe, de∣parted towards <HI>Fraunce.</HI> But before his taking shippe hée wrote vnto his Lady, as néere as I can gesse, these in∣suing verses.</P>

<P>Hauing written these verses vnto his Lady, he departed, what sithence hath hapned vnto him I doe not know, but imagine he hath sped as ill as those, who héeretofore haue made triall of the same aduenture. Now being departed, there was another gallant, which likewise fell in liking with my Lady <HI>Beleriza,</HI> one whom indéede the inheritance of my Lord their father, if they both hapned to die with∣out issue, of right did appertaine. This gallant called <HI>Signi∣or Roberto,</HI> imagining that my Lord their father, and his kinsman was either deade, or neuer to be deliuered, de∣uised which way to assure himselfe of his possessions: and thinking if hee could deuise how to obtaine my Lady to bée his wife, the matter were in a manner assured, conside∣ring that her brother, whose name was likewise called <HI>Ro∣berto,</HI> being a man of a valient and hauty minde, would hazard himselfe in the aduenture of the Inchaunted Ca∣stle, wherein he did not doubt, but that he would be eyther slaine, or taken prisoner, and then of right it should apper∣taine vnto him. And béeing resolued héereon, hee vsed all
<PB REF="74"/> the meanes he could to obtaine her liking. But she hauing setled her affection, as is before sayd, on <HI>Don Francisco,</HI> made small or no account him: which he perceauing, tur∣ned all his fained loue into hatred, deuising which way to bring to passe by trechery, that which he could not hope for by the loue of my Lady, which in the end he thus brought to passe.</P>
<P>Hauing many times animated his Cosin <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> to hazard himselfe for the deliuery of my Lord his father, which the young Gentleman himselfe, had a great desire vnto, and now hauing taken the order of Knighthoode, and made preparation for his iourny into <HI>Fraunce:</HI> and being accompanied the Sea-side, through which he must néedes passe, was at vnwares set on by a cupple of villaines, and before he could drawe his sword, was by them slaine: his Squire flying away, with in lesse then a mile, met with this graund homicide, his Maisters kinsman, vnto whom he recounted the murder of his Maister.</P>
<P><HI>Don Roberto</HI> hearing this, making as if he had grieued thereat mightily, raising the Country to apprehend those murtherers, the one of them taking a Riuer, hoping there∣by to escape, was drowned therein: the other being taken, was knowne to bee a seruant to the traytor <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> who comming where he was, after he had priuatly talked with him, and instructed him what he should say, examined him openly, where the villaine most falsely auouched, that they were hired to commit this murder, by my Lady <HI>Beleriza,</HI> which hee no sooner had confessed, but <HI>Don Ro∣berto,</HI> fearing least the feare of death should make him in the end to confesse the truth, with his ponyard suddenly stabbed him to the hart. Then posting to the Court, hée caused my Lady to be apprehended, accusing her before the King of the murder of her brother, which alas, was more grieuious vnto her, then the sentence of her owne death, which presently by the King was pronounced against her: if that within twelue months shee were not prouided of a
<PB REF="75"/> Knight, who in combat with <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> should main∣taine her innocencie. And now there is not passing tenne daies to come of the prefixed time, shee good Lady not ha∣uing any one, who will hazard himselfe for her deliuerance, although she is greatly pittied of euery one: yet so much is the number of good and hardy Knights in this Kingdome abated, by the occasion of the Princes losse, that there is scarce any one thought able to matche the traytor in single fight. Loe héere most noble Knight, haue I as néere as I can, declared vnto you the truth: hoping that God will so guide your minde, as to vndertake the defence, of the most vertuous and sorrowfull <HI>Beleriza.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> hauing attentiuely listned vnto her whole discourse, by which he assured himselfe of the inno∣cencie of the Lady, bad her recomfort herselfe, for if at his arriuall at the Court, by inquiry hee should finde the mat∣ter to be as she had declared, hee would, if <HI>Beleriza</HI> would accept of him as her Champion, hazard his body for her defence, not doubting but to make her accuser confesse his treason against her. Thus taking the Damsell w<SUP>t</SUP> him, they rode towards the Citty, where they arriued a little before night: The next day hauing rested himselfe, and viewed the statelinesse of the Citty, which to him séemed the good∣liest that euer he beheld, hee did what he might to inquire, the truth of the Ladies imprisonment: where by diuers he was informed in the same, euen as the Damsell had decla∣red vnto him. Thus hauing stayed some foure or fiue daies in the Citty, being continually visited by the Damsell, and now being throughly resolued of the innocencie of her La∣dy, was desirous to sée her, &amp; to know whether she would accept of him as her Champion. And being by the Damsell conuaied vnto the place where shee remained imprisoned, he was by her most kindly welcomed, giuing him a thou∣sand thankes for his proffered kindnesse, by her not any waies deserued, and admitting him for her Champion, she sayd. Noble Knight, I heere fréely deliuer vnto you, the de∣fence both of my life and honor, desiring God no other way
<PB REF="75"/> to spéede you, then according to the truth and equitie of my cause, which he knowes best: assuring you farther, that the death of my brother for which I am accused, is more grie∣uious vnto me, thē any torment I can indure. It is true re∣plied y<SUP>e</SUP> prince, euery vertuous wight, regardeth more y<SUP>e</SUP> losse of their friends, then of themselues, and I belieue the same of you: wherefore I doe not doubt, but to your eternall fame, I shall make manifest your innocencie. Thus depar∣ted he away, making preparation against the battaile: what happened therein, you shall reade in the Chapter following.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. How the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> fought with <HI>Roberto,</HI> and caused him to confesse his treason against <HI>Beleriza.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He day being come in which the beautifull <HI>Beleriza.</HI> was either to present her Champi∣on, or suffer death, for the surmised mur∣ther of her brother. The King with diuers of his Nobles, being already placed on their scaffold to behold the battaile: the prisoner was brought fourth attired all in blacke, hauing a farre white Laune cast ouer hee head, being accompanied with many beauti∣full Ladies of the Court, attired also in mourning appa∣rell, bewailing her misfortune: thus was shee conducted vnto a scaffold appointed for her, after her came the Appe∣lant, mounted on a stately bay courser, all in tauny armor, as sorrowing for the death of his kinsman. And comming before the King, bending himselfe in his Saddle, as doing obedience to his Maiestie, spake as followeth. Most dread Soueraigne, I humbly beséech you to cause that detestable murtherer, either presently to bring foorth her Champion, if she be of any one prouided, whom I may foorthwith, to y<SUP>e</SUP> manifestation of her crime ouercome, or if she be not pro∣uided, that then according to the lawe shee be foorthwith executed.</P>
<PB REF="76"/>
<P>The King disliking this is presumption, as also greatly affecting <HI>Beleriza,</HI> for her fathers sake, sayd. <HI>Signior Rober∣to,</HI> I know not whether y<SUP>e</SUP> prisoner be prepared of a Cham∣pion or no, but your presumptious boldnesse, in going a∣bout to teach mee what I haue to doe, causeth me thinke that your great pride will soone take a fall, for you might well haue stayed your hast, vntill I had caused the trum∣pets, according to the vse of Armes, to summon the deffen∣dant: and then if he had not come foorth at the third sum∣mons, you might boldly haue demaunded iustice.</P>
<P>Then staying a while, the trumpets were willed to sound to warne the defendant, who foorthwith being mounted on a milke white Stéede, his Armor all gréene, beset with Couslips of gold, and bearing in his shield in an Azure field a beautifull Lady, with his word in letters of gold, <HI>Vbi nescio:</HI> representing thereby, the Lady whom he sawe in his dreame. In this manner entred hee the Lists, and trotting with a comly soft pace towards the King, with his Beauer lifted vp, to whom he did reuerence, demaunding which was the Knight, who had so falsely accused the sor∣rowfull Lady. The King beholding his comly grace, and perceauing by his spéech that he was a stranger, most cour∣tiously, showed him <HI>Signior Roberto:</HI> vnto whom <HI>Iago</HI> spake as followeth.</P>
<P>Sir Knight, I doe not a little meruaile, how you béeing a man honorably discended, could harbor so base and vild a thought, as to accuse this Lady your kinswoman, of a murder wherein your selfe séemeth to be an Actor, other∣wise you would not so suddenly haue killed that wicked homicide your seruant, but haue suffred him to haue liued, and openly to haue confessed that, which you in your con∣science did greatly feare hee would denie: but I doubt not but God, by my arme, will manifest that, which by his death you did hope to haue concealed. <HI>Roberto</HI> raysing him selfe in his stirrups, and raging to be so touched with the truth, and trusting in his owne might and force, replyed in this manner.</P>
<PB REF="76"/>
<P>Foole-hardy Knight, thou shalt soone know what thy fol∣ly hath gained, by béeing allured with her lookes to hazard thy life in a cause so vniust as this is which thou doost de∣fend, and how farre thy false and opprobrious spéeches hath incensed my choller against thée, that whē as recreant thou shalt aske mercy, in stéed thereof thou shalt receiue cruell death. The King hearing these proude spéeches, comman∣ded the Iudges of y<SUP>e</SUP> field to take the othes of both knights, then the trumpets sounding, warned thē to prepare to the battell. Thus béeing by the Iudges placed in the lists, ha∣uing wind and sunne equally distributed vnto them, they set spurres to their horses, &amp; placing theyr Launces in theyr rests, they met together with such fury, that breaking their staues to theyr hands, <HI>Roberto</HI> was throwne frō his horse, and the Prince hauing likewise lost one of his stirrups, pas∣sed on without any great semblance of moouing: and com∣ming to the end of his course, turning about his horse, hee saw <HI>Signior Roberto</HI> addressing himselfe for the foote com∣bat: which he no sooner perceiued, but alighting from his horse, &amp; drawing foorth his sword, went to méet him, where betwéene them began a most cruell and doubtfull combat, no man knowing to which party victory was like to insue, <HI>Don Roberto</HI> béeing a very strong and mightie Knight, layd on blowes amaine, as trusting in his great strength, which surely was much, and had hee beene indued as well with vertue as vallour, he might well haue béene estéemed for one of the best Knights in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Don Iago,</HI> on the other side, béeing very nimble &amp; quicke of body, although not altogether so strong as his enemy, a∣uoyded his blowes with very great skill, many times wounding his aduersary, both with thrusts and blowes, himselfe sometimes receiuing wounds likewise: so that the ground was besprinckled with theyr blood, which issued out in many places through theyr Armor. Thus continu∣ed they by the space of one whole howre, neuer so much as once taking breath, by which time their Armor was broken in many places, especially that of the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> which
<PB REF="77"/> béeing not altogether of the best, though gallant to the eye, was broken the sooner with his huge blowes: although on the contrary side, <HI>Roberto</HI> had receiued more great &amp; dan∣gerous wounds, through the thrusts which the Prince had made. And now béeing both breathlesse, they rested them∣selues awhile, viewing each other, and studying which way most how to indammage his aduersary. At length, they ha∣uing well rested thēselues, they fell to theyr combat afresh, the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> séeming more lustie and quicke then at the beginning, began now to follow his aduersary with many mighty blowes and sharpe thrusts, causing him in a man∣ner, nothing but to defend himselfe: and imagining indéed that he was not long able to continue, very vnaduisedly pursued him with blowes and thrusts, not hauing any re∣gard to defend himselfe, but to offend his foe. Which <HI>Ro∣berto</HI> perceiuing, gaue him so cruell a blow on y<SUP>e</SUP> right side, that pearcing his Armor, which was not of sufficient force to defend the might of his arme, wounded him to the bone: which the Prince féeling, and considering that it came by his rash carelesnesse, determined to haue a greater regard to himselfe: &amp; following his fortune with good aduisement, gaue <HI>Don Roberto</HI> to vnderstand, that y<SUP>e</SUP> blow was to him a good schoole point, so that at length hauing driuen him from place to place, béeing no longer able to withstand his force, hauing lost great abundance of blood, hee fell on his knees, desiring him to saue his life, and he would confesse y<SUP>e</SUP> whole truth.</P>
<P>The Prince héereunto soone granted, and bringing him before the King, <HI>Roberto</HI> confessed, first how he had deuised to come vnto the inhearitance of the Lord <HI>Mowbray</HI> his kinsman, by marrying with his daughter, and afterwards béeing by her refused, how he had deuised this meanes, as in the former Chapter is declared. Which when the King with the rest of the Lords there present had heard, they did not a little meruaile hereat: and presently causing the La∣dy <HI>Beleriza</HI> to be fet, and greatly honoured, extolling the strange Knight highly, the King demaunded of <HI>Beleriza</HI> of
<PB REF="77"/> whence and what he was: to which she aunswered that she knew not. Then the King demaunded of himselfe of what Country he was. And he very curteously aunswered him, that he was borne in the Dukedom of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and hauing giuen his mind to trauell, was commonly called the Knight of Fortune: and now hapning to arriue to this Country, and comming to view this Court, the statelines whereof he had many times before heard of, was by chance giuen to vnderstand, the wrong which was doone vnto <HI>Beleriza</HI> by her Cosin <HI>Don Roberto,</HI> and considering that it is the part of all Knights to defend the innocent, especially Ladies and Gentlewomen, who are not able to defend themselues, I vndertooke the same, which by the assistance of y<SUP>e</SUP> Almigh∣tie I haue accomplished.</P>
<P>The King hearing this his spéech, which he vttered with a most comly grace, greatly commended him in his hart: and giuing charge vnto his Surgions for the curing of his wounds, wherof he had great néede, he determined to pro∣céede in iudgement against <HI>Signior Roberto.</HI> But hee by this time, through the many grieuous and mortal wounds which he had receiued, had giuen vp the ghost: whereby he preuented the King of inflicting the punishment which hee worthily deserued, and which assuredly, if he had liued, hée shold haue suffered. But now séeing he was already dead, the King commaunded him to be buried in the same place where the battel was fought, causing him to be layd for the honour of the House, from whence hee was discended, in a Tombe of Marble, very curiously wrought, with this E∣pitaph written thereon.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The next day, no sooner had beautifull <HI>Aurora,</HI> rowling herselfe out of old <HI>Nox</HI> his couch, stept foorth into the viewe of this world, being raide in her wonted garments of gray, and as it were halfe blushing to haue remained so long, in the loutish armes of her late old bed-fellowe, went to welcome her new Bridge-grome the sonne, but our two noble Knights being mounted on their stately Stéeds, and armed at all points, entred the Lists: scarce dayning one to speake to the other. And now hauing fetcht their ca∣rere, met together with such force, that their Launces were broken into a thousand shiuers, the splinters thereof flying into the aire, themselues both passing on without any mo∣tion of moouing in their Saddles: and hauing ended their course, and turning about their horses, <HI>Adresto</HI> intreated the Knight of the Lions, to breake a staffe or two more, vntill such time as one of them were dismounted, to which he willingly agreed: and at y<SUP>e</SUP> commaundement of <HI>Adresto,</HI> there was a bundle of Launces brought, the Knight being willed to chuse first.</P>
<P>Then running againe, they incountred with such force, that <HI>Adresto</HI> loosing both his stirrups, was likewise forced to take hold by his horse mane, the other béeing in the same sort driuen to take hold, hauing lost his right stirrup, &amp; she
<PB REF="79"/> reynes of his bridle, yet passed they both onwards, and cō∣ming to the end of theyr course, tooke new Launces, each confessing to himselfe, neuer to haue receiued the like in∣counter: and then setting theyr spurres the third time to theyr horses, <HI>Adresto</HI> vsed these or such like spéeches to him selfe: Fie, fie, <HI>Adresto,</HI> what is become of thy former val∣lor, which wast wont to send euery one with whom thou incountredst, to take measure of his length on the ground: is thy strength growne weaker then it hath béene, or dooth thy conscience accusing thée of disloialtie towards <HI>Lenarda,</HI> cause thy force to diminish: no, it is neither, but onely the vallor of this Knight, with whom thou doost contend. On the otherside, the Knight of the Lyons calling to his minde his beloued Lady the Princesse <HI>Egisena,</HI> said: Déere La∣dy, sée héere thy féeble Knight, as it were mated by this false <HI>Adresto,</HI> nay, onely the feare of your dislike, is the cause that he hath béene able to indure against me: but I beséech you call to minde your former kindnesses, and confirme the same with your constant assurance, and then I doubt not but to be well able to vanquish this Knight, whom for his vallor I cannot chuse but loue.</P>
<P>These spéeches on both sides were scarce ended, when méeting together, they brake theyr staues hard home to theyr Gauntlets, and méeting with theyr bodies, they ru∣shed together in such sort, that theyr horses had much to doo to stand vnder them, but were forced to ramble backwards, but at length, hauing recouered themselues, the Knights béeing both wearied with theyr rough incoūters, not mind∣ing any more to Iust, drew foorth theyr swords, and pre∣paring themselues to the Combat, the Knight of the Ly∣ons was the first that assayled his aduersary: and tutching his horse with his left spurre, came close with <HI>Adresto,</HI> deliuering him such a blow on the shield, that slyeing away a great part thereof, wounded him a little on the left thygh: which <HI>Don Adresto,</HI> soone requited, for comming in with his left side, and making as if he would haue giuen a thrust at his body, suddenly by the agillity and quicknesse of his
<PB REF="80"/> horse, he was on the other side of him, and deliuered a full blowe at his head, taking him so sound a knocke, that had it not béene for the goodnesse of his Armor, he had then en∣ded the battaile: but the Armor beeing of approoued good∣nesse saued his Maister from any hurt, although y<SUP>e</SUP> weight thereof did halfe a stony him, but comming soone to his me∣mory, &amp; raising himselfe in his stirrupps, he gaue <HI>Adresto</HI> a mighty blowe, which had he not warded with his shield, had assuredly claue him to the téeth, for notwithstanding, the goodnesse of the shield, which was of pure &amp; well tem∣pered steele: he claue it in the midst, and entring through both Helme and coyfe, wounded him in the head, to the great astonishment of his sences. Thus continued they a great while with equall odds, not one knowing which had the a vantage: for although <HI>Adresto</HI> had receaued many wounds, yet the vertue of the King which he weare on his finger was such, that he lost not one droppe of blood: Thus hauing continued by the space of two houres, at last the Knight of the Lions, hauing giuen him a mighty blowe on the head, which caused him as one in a traunce to réele on his horse, and before such time as he could recouer him∣selfe, hauing deliuered another blowe betwéene his head &amp; shoulders, caused him to fall from his horse in a traunce, which the Knight of the Lions perceauing, immediatly dismounted, thinking to haue taken off his Helme, and to haue giuen him ayre, but before hee could come vnto him, <HI>Adresto</HI> had recouered his féete, and taking vp his sword, which hung by a small chayne fastned vnto his arme, sayd: Knight of the Lyons, I had thought before this time there had not béen any Knight able to match mee on horsebacke, but now I find my selfe deceiued: wherfore I suppose thou maist thanke thine Armorer, which hath so well fitted thée, but I doubt not now beeing on foote, to deale with you some what better. It is well sayd, answered the other, and were not my cause more iust then thine, I should greatly feare mee of the victory: but considering the wrong which thou doost vnto that vertuous Lady <HI>Lenarda,</HI> it causeth mee to
<PB REF="80"/> hope the best: wherefore once more let me intreate thée to consent to returne vnto her. Nay, aunswered <HI>Adresto,</HI> I both defie thy intreates, and her loue, and therefore defend thy selfe. Then againe hurred they together more fiercely then at the first, but not with like aduantage, for <HI>Adresto</HI> before was greatly ayded by the quicknes of his horse: and now béeing on foote, although he were very quick and nim∣ble, yet the paine which he sustained by his wounds were a great hinderance vnto him. On the contrary side, the Knight of the Lyons, béeing before on the backe of a horse daily vsed to trauell, was not altogether of the quickest, but now béeing on foote, and in his chiefe prime, not hauing re∣ceiued any wound, was farre more quick then his aduersa∣rie, by which meanes he both saued himselfe, and hurt his enemy euen at pleasure. And at length, taking <HI>Adresto</HI> at aduantage, gaue him a sound blow on the side of the head, which caused him so ramble, and before hee could recouer himselfe, gaue him one or two more, so that hee was forced in a traunce to fall to the earth: which the Knight percei∣uing, stept vnto him, and before hee would giue him ayre, tooke of his gauntlet, and then finding the ring, tooke it frō his finger: and vnlacing his Helme, he soone brought him to himselfe, and perceiuing him to offer to rise, said, <HI>Adre∣sto</HI> yéeld thy selfe, and promise to forsake this wicked kinde of life, and to goe into <HI>Spayne</HI> to the Dutches <HI>Lenarda,</HI> or else thou diest.</P>
<P><HI>Adresto</HI> béeing throughly come to himselfe, and hearing the name of <HI>Lenardo,</HI> began to call to mind his former loue towards her, and in a manner cleane forgetting the Mer∣chants daughter, said. Most noble Knight, I doo not onely yéeld my selfe vnto your mercy, but also willingly will doe as you commaund me, where I will yéeld mee to the noble Dutches mercy: whom I must néedes confesse, greatly to haue wronged. The Knight of the Lyons immediatly ta∣king him vp from the ground, imbrast him in his armes, saying: that if he did as he had promised, he should do right well, and in so dooing, hee should find him for euer an assu∣red
<PB REF="81"/> friend. For which <HI>Adresto</HI> gaue him infinite thankes, vowing to him the like.</P>
<P>Now by this time was the Lady <HI>Lenardas</HI> Squire come vnto them, and saluting <HI>Adresto,</HI> demaunded how he did, <HI>Adresto</HI> beholding him, immediatly knewe him, and im∣bracing him in his armes, demanded how his Lady fared, to whom the Squire declared, the great sorrow wherin she had remained euer since his departure. And now hauing bound vp the wounds which he had receiued in the combat as well as they could, (for as soone as the King was taken from his finger, his wounds fell on bléeding) they returned into the Cittie, where they remained by the space of three wéekes, for the curing of his wounds, and prouiding all things necessary for their departure. Then taking leaue of the fayre Damsell whom he left with child, and the rest of his acquaintance, they departed towards the Citty of <HI>Wa∣terford,</HI> where they were in hope to finde the ship in which the Knight of y<SUP>e</SUP> Lyons had there arriued, leauing all <HI>Dub∣lin</HI> sorry for his departure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. How the Knight of the Lyons trauelling towards <HI>Waterford</HI> in the company of <HI>Adresto,</HI> was like to haue beene mur∣dered, by the meanes of the Damsell of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and by what meanes he was preserued.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Knight of the Lyons, being accom∣panied with <HI>Adresto,</HI> and his Squires, rode on so farre the first day, that they ar∣riued in a small village some 15 leagues from <HI>Dublin</HI> where was onely one Ca∣stle, and some fewe cottages, in which Castle there dwelt a Knight y<SUP>t</SUP> was some kinne vnto the Damsell, which was so intirely beloued of <HI>Adresto:</HI> and héere the Knights minding to rest themselues for that night, were welcommed and entertained by the Lord of the Castle, called <HI>Mack Gillum,</HI> with the greatest
<PB REF="81"/> shew of kindnesse that might be, the more secretly to con∣ceale the euill which he intended in his hart, (as it is for the most part the common vse of those Country people, which will not sticke to laugh you in the face, and presently to cut your throte:) euen so dealt this Traytor, who hauing re∣ce ued into his house as gests these two notable Knights, binding them welcome with a <HI>Iudas</HI> kisse, and feasting them with all the delica's that the shortnesse of the time could af∣foord, yet his enueterate malice towards the Knight of the Lyons, for carrying away <HI>Don Adresto</HI> from his Cosin, was such, that notwithstanding all the former curtesies which he shewed him, minded in the end to rob him of his life: which he thought to bring to passe in his sort.</P>
<P>There was vnder one of the fayrest Chambers in the Castle, a darke and déepe vaute, hauing no way into the same but by a trappe-doore out of the fore-said Chamber, ouer which he caused a bed to be made for the Knight, and hauing placed two or thrée villaines in the vaute, with charge to murder him, caused in stéed of ropes, nothing but small sticks to be layd vnder the bed, which might sustaine the weight thereof: so y<SUP>t</SUP> the Knight once laying him downe theron, must of force tumble headlong into the vaut, where the villaines béeing ready to receiue him, should soone haue ended his life: had not GOD otherwise prouided for his safety, and appointed him to a farther setting foorth of his glory, and thus it was. His seruant <HI>Gillimo,</HI> whose life he saued, when as he slew the rest of his company, the night before hee rescued <HI>Molenda,</HI> and of a thiefe entertained him to be his seruaunt: hée I say, contrary to the common vse of such fellowes, who according to the old saying, (Saue a thiefe from the gallowes, and he will be the first that will cut thy throte) hauing an especiall loue and care vnto his Maister, as thinking that time ill spent, which was not to his profit or content, &amp; that in dooing the same hee did God good seruice, was alwayes very carefull and diligent about him, especially, where hee did any way suspect euill to be meant towards him: but now more thē at any other time,
<PB REF="82"/> knowing the wickednes of <HI>Mack Gillum,</HI> hee listned and prided about, to sée if hee could perceaue them whisper a∣mongst themselues. A little after supper, comming sudden∣ly into a darke entry, he heard some talking, and listning a while vnto them: one of them sayd: Well, &amp; my Maister and they aboue, doe their part kindly, in causing the bed to fall, this dagger shall pierce his hart, farre sooner then <HI>Adrestos</HI> sword could pierce his Armor. Nay replyed ano∣ther, I will surely giue him the first wound, for robbing <HI>Valeria</HI> of her Louer. <HI>Gillimo</HI> hearing this knew present∣ly that it was his Maister whom they ment, wherefore dil∣ligently noting the place, he returned safely into the roome where he left his Maister, and finding them ready to goe to their Chamber, hee could not conueniently make it knowne.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Mack Gillum</HI> hauing called for lights, willed his wife and two of his daughters, to accompany <HI>Adresto</HI> vn∣to his chamber, and hee himselfe would accompany the Knight of the Lions vnto his (where hee hoped ere long to be sufficiently reuenged, for the wrong which hee had done vnto his Cosin.) Thus hauing brought him to his chamber, he continued discoursing of many matters, vn∣till he was almost vnready, then bidding him good night, he went towards the doore to haue gone foorth, and com∣ming somewhat neare the bed: on a sudden <HI>Gillimo</HI> stept vnto him, and before he was ware thereof, tooke him in his armes, and by cleane force threw him into the midst of the bed: from whence immediatly the stickes breaking, hée tumbled headlong into the Vaut, where he was presently slabde to death by the villaines, which he had prepared to haue kilde the Knight of the Lions: so that the saying of the Scripture in him was rightly fulfilled, he hath layd a snare for another, and himselfe is falne into the mischiefe there∣of.</P>
<P>The Knight of the Lions, &amp; the rest of them that were in the chamber, at the first were greatly astonied héereat: but séeing the sequell, and considering that it was deuised
<PB REF="82"/> of purpose for to haue murdered him, fell on their knées, and gaue thankes vnto almighty God, who had deliuered him, out of this iminent danger of death. Then calling for his Armor, he foorthwith armed himselfe, and giuing <HI>Gil∣limo</HI> thankes for his good seruice, willed him to tel by what meanes he came to y<SUP>e</SUP> knowledge of this treason: to whom <HI>Gillimo</HI> declared the forme before recited. Then went hée vp and downe the Castle, killing such as hee thought any way culpable in the same: and comming into the chamber where <HI>Adresto</HI> was, in the company of the Lady and her daughters, who by this time had heard of all that which was hapned, they came and fell downe at his féete pitti∣fully wéeping, beséeching him to haue compassion of them, and not to reuenge the fault committed by one, vpon them all, assuring him they were not any way priuy to y<SUP>e</SUP> which had hapned. The Knight, partly through compassion, which he alwaies bare towards Ladies and Damsells, and part∣ly at the intreaty of <HI>Adresto,</HI> whom had hee not intirely lo∣ued, hee should likewise haue suspected to be consenting to this treason, willed them to stand vp, and warning them euer héereafter, for attempting y<SUP>e</SUP> like treason against any one, he forgaue them: then taking order for their safe∣ty that night, they betooke them to their rests, where they slept soundly vntill the next day: when taking their leaue of the Lady and her daughters, whom they left busie in burying of the dead bodies, they departed onwards on their iourny towards <HI>Waterford,</HI> where within two daies they safely arriued, not hauing met with any aduenture worth the reciting: &amp; comming to the Harbor, they found the Barke in a readinesse, all the company earnestly expec∣ting his comming. Where we will for a while leaue them, looking for a winde for <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. How the <HI>Scottish</HI> King sent ouer into <HI>Denmarke,</HI> vnder the conduct of his Cosin the Earle of <HI>Douglasse,</HI> tenne thou∣sand Souldiers, and how the Arch-Bishop and the o∣ther Traytors, ioyned their forces with him.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou may remember how in the former part of this History, that the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> the Count <HI>Hermes,</HI> and others of the chiefe states of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> disliking the gouernment, whereof themselues were in a manner the chiefe and first beginners, had practised with the <HI>Scottish</HI> King, for the sending ouer forces, promising to deliuer the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke</HI> into his hands, and farther, to that end had deliuered pledges for sure perfor∣mance thereof.</P>
<P>Now therefore the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> hauing mustred vp his forces, made choise of tenne thousand of his approoued and best men of Armes, and hauing fitted them of all things néedfull for that warre, gaue them in charge vnto his kins∣man the Earle of <HI>Douglasse:</HI> a man for his vallour and courage highly to bee commended, and for his wisdome and pollicie, to bee compared with most in Christendome: as hauing great experience, especially in matters of affaires, wherein he had spent the greatest part of his time, being now about the age of forty eight or fifty yeares: vn∣to him did the King deliuer this Armie, with frée commissi∣on to dispose thereof, &amp; of the whole affaires of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> With this Armie he departed towards the Sea-coast, ac∣companied with many braue and hardy Knights who vol∣lentary went to beare him company, with hope in these warres to gaine same by their vallour: and being come to the towne of <HI>Helfue,</HI> they tooke shipping, and the winde seruing thē, they directed their course towards <HI>Denmarke,</HI> hauing before hand sent intelligence of their comming, vn∣to the traytors to their Country, their confedrats, who like∣wise
<PB REF="83"/> vpon this newes, vsed all the dilligence they could, for the leauying of their forces to ioyne with the forren power: causing Libels, and other meanes to be wrote, to seduce others likewise from their loyaltie towards their Gouer∣nors and Country, and to fall into the same treason with them. Of which sort there were a great many, who for di∣uers causes were soone drawne into the same, especially such as by any meanes had offended the lawes, and feared the penaltie thereof: which by the Gouernors was seuere∣ly executed.</P>
<P>Who now vpon this rumor and hurliburly, were not a little troubled, and perceauing such great men to be actors héerein, feared a generall reuolt, wherefore drawing themselues together into counsell, they deuised all the meanes they could, to preuent the same: and hauing sent vnto the Arch Bishop and his complices, by faire meanes to haue caused them to lay downe their weapons, and not like madmen as it were to rip their owne bowels, which they must néedes doe in stirring vp this ciuill contention, which is the greatest enemie that possible may happen to any common-wealth, and that in calling in forren powers, was not only to bring into bondage their Country, and natiue soyle, but also themselues and their whole posteri∣tie: for what Conquerer is there, that hauing brought into subiection any Kingdome or Prouince, will not cause his owne lawes &amp; customes to be imbraced by the vanquished, which he cannot well doe, except first he not only roote out those, whom he thinkes may be any way a hindrance vnto his procéedings, then likewise must hee place as Gouer∣nors and Rulers ouer his people, such as he shall thinke readiest to obey and fulfill his commaundements, which can be no other but of his owne natiue Country: and then how grieuous it will bee vnto you to be commaunded by strangers, doe but consider. But peraduenture you will say, that the King of <HI>Scots</HI> hath promised, not only to con∣tinue you in your former estates, but also preferre you to higher dignities, and you will relie vppon his royall pro∣mise.
<PB REF="84"/> Consider wee beséech you, how that he, nor no man liuing whatsoeuer he be hath any terme or assurance of his life in this world, and that though hee kéepe his promise with you, yet your felicity is of no longer assurance then his life: but suppose he should liue a long time, knowe you not, that he that by ambition gaineth a Crowne, no sooner commeth to the possessions thereof, but he presently cutteth downe the prope, by which himselfe did clime thereunto, fearing by the same likewise to fall as he did rise.</P>
<P>This, or the like exhortation, the Gouernors at the first vsed towards the rebellious Traytors, which could no∣thing at all mooue them to giue ouer theyr pretended trea∣chery: and then séeing there was no way, but by force to withstand their fury, knowing also that the Scottish forces were on the coast, and daily expected to land, they tooke order forth-with for the leauying of forces, placing new and great supplies in their garrison Townes, furnishing them both with munition and vittailes, as well as the shortnes of the time would permit them. And now hauing gathe∣red togethers thirty thousand souldiers, the greatest part whereof were men taken from the Plow and Cart, fitter with the sharpe Colter to teare vp the ground, then with sword and speare to incounter with the enemy in the fielde, and their Leaders most of them as vnskilful as theyr soldi∣ers, knowing how better to daunce a galliard or a Pauine in a Ladies Chamber, then to marshall a band of men rea∣die to incounter theyr enemies: so much had the lacke of vse of Armes, since the losse of theyr King, altered that flo∣rishing kingdom, which in former time did greatly abound with many stout &amp; hardy Knights, a great number where∣of were either dead or lost in the search of their King. The one halfe of which Armie béeing giuen in charge vnto the Lords of <HI>Opencade</HI> &amp; <HI>Londen,</HI> marched towards the Arch∣bishop and his confederates, who with the number of 12 or 14. thousand souldiers, being on the other side the riuer of <HI>Estate,</HI> began to spoyle and sack the Country, putting to sword, all those that made any resistance against them, and
<PB REF="84"/> hauing taken <HI>Cargue</HI> and <HI>Londen,</HI> two Townes of great strength, placed therein garrisons, then marching towards <HI>Opencade,</HI> they heard of the comming of the Lords of <HI>O∣pencade</HI> &amp; <HI>Londen,</HI> and fearing to be taken at aduantage, they altered theyr course towards <HI>Rensborge,</HI> where the Earle <HI>Dowglasse</HI> with his forces was landed, hoping to ioyne with him: which the Lords of <HI>Opencade</HI> &amp; <HI>Londen</HI> vnderstanding, pursued him so eagerly, that béeing come within sight almost of the Scots, they set vpon their rere∣ward, putting a great number of them to the sword: and euen at the same instant, was the other Army, which which was ledde by the Lord <HI>Itsenho,</HI> and the County of <HI>Mildrop,</HI> likewise come in sight, which caused a great feare in the harts of the Traytors, so that had it not béene for a company of two thousand Scots, which came to their re∣scue vnder the conduct of Sir <HI>Iames Lewrence,</HI> Cosin ger∣man vnto the Earle, they had béen all eyther slaine, or put to flight: but the comming of this succor, so animated theyr almost fainting courages, that, where before they were in a manner ready to turne theyr backes, they now began to recouer theyr ground that they had lost, the fight growing very hote and bloody on both sides, there béeing slaine of the States aboue a thousand souldiers, and of the Rebels 800.</P>
<P>Longer had the fight continued, but that the Lord <HI>Har∣ding,</HI> and the Count <HI>Hermes,</HI> fearing the comming of the other power, which was hard at hand, caused the retraite to be sounded, and so with an easie pace marched to the <HI>Scottish</HI> Campe, not minding if they could chuse, to fight in two or thrée daies, because of the wearines of his souldiers, who comming newly from Sea, were many of them di∣stempered. The States likewise, hauing ioynd both theyr Armies, intrenched themselues: thus lay they by the space of seauen dayes, within view of each other, daily skyrmi∣shing together, in which the States alwaies had the worst, through theyr vnskilfulnesse in martiall discipline, where we will for a while leaue them, and returne to speake of o∣ther matters.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Rince <HI>Iago,</HI> hauing deliuered the Lady <HI>Beleriza,</HI> naming himselfe the Knight of Fortune, was greatly honoured in the <HI>English</HI> Court, where at the intreatie of the King, hee stayed by the space of a month, where daily hee heard many strange reports of the Inchaunted Ca∣stle in the Kingdome of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and beeing desirous to try the aduenture thereof, his Squire giuing him to vnder∣stand that there was a shippe ready bound for the Riuer of <HI>Nainse,</HI> determined to passe ouer therein: wherefore taking his leaue of the King and Quéene, and others who had shewed him great honour during his abode in <HI>England,</HI> the Lady <HI>Beleriza</HI> hauing made him many large proffers, for the vnspeakeable kindnesse which shee had receiued at his hands, all which hee refused: but because hee would not shew himselfe altogether discurteous, hee receiued a fayre Diamond, which he promised alwaies for her sake to weare vpon his finger. And now hauing prouided all such things as he had néed of, and agréeing with the Maister of the ship for his passage, he went aboord, and hauing the wind fayre, they set to Sea in so happy a time, that within sixe dayes, they arriued at a Port called <HI>Old-bay,</HI> where going on shore, they directed theyr course towards y<SUP>e</SUP> Citty of <HI>Nanse,</HI> where, he staying awhile to rest himselfe, he vnderstood that the Quéene, with a great trayne of Lords &amp; Ladies, were lately arriued at the Citty of <HI>Towels,</HI> whether, because it lay not much out of his way, he determined to trauell to sée the fashion of the <HI>French</HI> Court, which then florished with noble Dames, among whō was the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> and

And béeing nowe come vnto the age of sixtéene yéeres, the young <HI>Hendritio</HI> was exercised in riding of horses, &amp; running at tylt, wherin he shewed himselfe not any way vnlike to the noble Prince his Father, hauing a great desire to be knighted, whcih by no meanes his Grand-father would permit, fearing least he would hazard himselfe in that aduenture, whereof there had so many failed.</P>
<P>The Princesse <HI>Oliua</HI> in like sort, béeing of most singuler and rare beautie, could scarce be suffered to be once out of the sight of her Grand mother, who loued her more then a∣ny of her owne Children: and being now as we haue said, at the Citty of <HI>Towers,</HI> (the Quéene partly for her owne content, but chiefely for to delight the Princesse <HI>Emilia</HI> her Daughter, who continually since the losse of the English Prince, had spent her time in great sorrow, onely the com∣fort which shée had in her children, did a little mittigate the same) did daily vse to ride foorth on hunting, into the forrest which was euen hard adioyning to the Citty, in which for∣rest, there was great store of all manner of wilde Beastes. And béeing the same day that the Knight of Fortune was comming to the Court, gone foorth very early, the Hunts∣men had roused a mighty Hart, which making way before the hounds, caused all the Lords and Ladies to follow af∣ter, and gallopping very swiftly through the Forrest, had quickly separated themselues into many companies, so that with the Quéene there was left no more but the Princesse <HI>Oliua,</HI> and two or thrée other Ladies, and some three or foure Knights, when suddenly a mighty great Giant, all armed, issued out from the thickest of the wood, and with a meruailous fierce countenance came towards them, to the great astonishment of the Quéene &amp; the other Ladies, who
<PB REF="86"/> began to flie as fast as their horses could carry them. One of the Knights that was with the Quéene, béeing more har∣die then his fellowes, stayd to make resistance whilst the o∣thers escaped: but alas, small was the defence which hee could make being vnarmed, against so mighty a foe, whose huge Armour he was not able to pierce, although thereon he brake his Borespeare which he had in his hand all to shi∣uers: and drawing out his sword to try if that would doe any better, before hee could deliuer any stroke there with, was himselfe clouen to the middle. And leauing him there, the Giant persued the others, which by this time had gained a great way before him: and comming into a rough stony way, the horse wheron y<SUP>e</SUP> Princesse <HI>Oliua</HI> rode stum∣bled and fell to y<SUP>e</SUP> ground, not béeing able to recouer againe. Which she perceiuing, beganne to flie on foote, whereby in short space, the Gyant had gained a great deale of ground of her, so that within lesse then a quarter of a mile hée must néeds haue ouertaken her, had not the Knight of Fortune, (béeing as is aforesaid, riding towards the Citty <HI>Towers</HI>) hapned to arriue: who at the first séeing a farre of one run∣ning so fast, was presently touched with the remembrance of his former vision: and calling to his Squire, put on his Helmet, and taking his Launce in his hand, rode towards them, when presently the Lady (béeing cleane wearied and out of breath) cast herselfe downe before him, not béeing a∣ble to speake a word.</P>
<P>The Knight viewing her singuler beauty, knew pre∣sently that it was the same Lady whō in his fancie hee had vowed to serue: wherefore incouraging himselfe, thinking that now was the time, if euer, to shew himselfe valerous, béeing in her presence, and in her cause, for whose sake hée could indure a thousand deaths, spake vnto her in this ma∣ner. Most beautifull Lady, comfort your selfe, and feare not this huge lump of flesh which hath pursued you, for I doubt not, but God will so strengthen mine arme, as I shall soone be able to make him confesse his folly, in going about to wrong so heauenly a creature. Then setting spurres to his
<PB REF="86"/> horse, he ranne against the Giant, who by this time was come almost vnto them, and hitting him full in the midst of the massy shield which he wore, hanging by a stirrup about his necke, gaue him such a blow, that piercing the same, he caused him to ramble backwards, béeing hardly able to stand vpon his legges, breaking his Launce all to peeces. Thus hauing ended his course, he turned about, and fea∣ring that in fighting on horsebacke, hee might be in great danger if the Giant should kill his horse, hee allighted, and dressing his Shield on his arme, hee drew foorth his sword, going boldly to méete his huge enemie: who hauing reco∣uered himselfe of the incounter, likewise went towards the Knight, with a mighty Semiter in his hand, thinking at the first blow to haue cleft him in two. But he being wary, easily auoided the same, by shifting his body aside, the Gi∣ant hauing mist his blow, was not able to recouer his Se∣miter so lightly, (which was entred almost a foote into the ground) but that the Knight taking the aduantage there∣of, gaue him a sore blow on the left arme, almost at the shoulder, which piercing his thicke Armour cut him to the bone, the griefe whereof was such, that hee could not after∣wards rule his massy targe so well as otherwise he would, by which meanes he had great aduantage: for now the Gi∣ant béeing forced to lay on, and onely to trust to his sword both for offence and defence, many times receiued wound vpon wound: sometimes likewise fastning blowes on his aduersary, hee would cause him to bend his knées to the ground, renting his Armor where he touched, and causing the blood to issue out thereof in many places. Thus conti∣nued they a long time, the aduantage, if there were any, remaining with the Knight of Fortune.</P>
<P>By this time had the Princesse <HI>Oliua</HI> recouered herselfe againe, and although shée saw the Knight to haue the better side, yet the feare which she had was such, that shee would haue fled away she wist not whether, had it not béen for the Knights Squire, who comming vnto her, perswaded her with many arguments to stay and sée the end, which hee
<PB REF="87"/> was certaine could not be without the death of the Gyant, for that his Lord did continually increase vpon him, and whose vallour he knew to be such, that the longer hee con∣tinued, the more increased his courage: but put case the Giant should haue the victory, yet would it of force be with such danger to himselfe, that they néeded not to feare his pursute. The Princesse being something héerewith com∣forted, was contented to stay the end, yet not beeing fully resolued of feare, she intreated the Squire to helpe mount her on his Maisters horse, which he did, then sitting to be∣hold the combat, she questioned with him of many matters touching his Maister, whom in her hart shee greatly com∣mended, demaunding what and of whence hee was. To which his Squire replied, that hee was discended of noble blood, but for his name and Country, he might not disclose to any one, being commaunded to the contrary, only this, he called himselfe the Knight of Fortune. Then declaring vnto her his first combat at Sea, and the battaile with <HI>Signior Roberto,</HI> when hee deliuered the Lady <HI>Beleriza:</HI> where hearing of the strange reports of the inchaunted Castle, he determined to make triall thereof, not forget∣ting to declare vnto her his Maisters Vision at Sea, which more then all the rest did cause her to admire, thinking with her selfe that it was only by the worke of God: then considering what it was to bee loued by such a Knight, whose equall she neuer had before séene, beganne déeply to fancie him. Thus past they away the time, whiles the two fierce Champions continued their combat, both giuing and receauing many wounds, all the ground bée∣ing stayned with their blood: and now the Giant being al∣together inraged, rebelling and cursing his false Gods, foming at the mouth like a mad man, ranne vppon the Knight, thinking to haue taken him in his armes, but hée perceauing his intent, and lothing such imbracements, preuented him by auoyding through the quicknesse of his body, deliuering withall so sound a blowe on his right arme, which he had stretched foorth, that he caused both it
<PB REF="87"/> and his heauie Semiter to fly into the field, then persuing his victory, he neuer left wounding of him, till such time as he caused him to fall dead to the ground.</P>
<P>And then parting his head from his shoulders, he knée∣led downe on his knées, rending thankes to God for the victory: and taking vp the head, hee went and presented the same to the Princesse, desiring her to accept the same, as the first showe of his loue, who had vowed himselfe wholy to her seruice. The Princesse dying her chéekes with a moddest blush, giuing him harty thankes for preser∣uing her life, she intreated him to conduct her to the Cit∣ty, where she would cause him to be honored according to his desert. The Knight easily consented héereto, and ha∣uing bound vp this wounds, caused his Squire to place her behind him, in this sort rode they onwards, the Knight declaring vnto her his loue, which he had vowed long be∣fore he had séene her, only by his vision which he had séene, when first he left his owne Country. Whilst they were thus discoursing of loue, they perceaued a great troope of Knights, comming galloping towards them, which when they were come néere vnto them, the Princesse knewe them to be the Quéenes Knights: who being gathered to∣gether, and finding her wanting, were sent to pursue the Giant, and now hauing found her so well rescued, they were not a little glad thereof: meruailing greatly how she had escaped. And demaunding of her, were giuen to vn∣derstand, the whole discourse before recited, wherein shee did not faile to extoll the Knights vallor to the vttermost: but hee attributed his victory more to her beauty then his owne vallour. Thus rode they on till they came to the Cit∣ty, one of the Knights carrying the Giants head, to y<SUP>e</SUP> great wonder of the whole Citty, who highly commended so vallerous a déede. And comming to the Court, they were receaued with great ioy by the Quéene, and the Princesse <HI>Emilia.</HI> who assuredly estéemed her lost: but when they vn∣derstood the manner how shee was deliuered, they gaue God harty thankes, greatly honoring and commending
<PB REF="88"/> the Knight of fortune, feasting and intertaining him with all the kindnesse that might be, and being lodged in the Pallace, was euery day during the cure of his wounds, visited by the Princesse <HI>Emilia</HI> and her daughter, vnto whom many times hee declared his passions: which the Princesse perceauing to be extreame, beganne something to pitty him, which <HI>Cupid</HI> perceauing, and minding to showe his diuine power, wounded her to the hart with one of his impoysoned shafts, whereby shee could neuer bée in quiet but in his presence: which hee perceauing, beganne farre sooner then otherwise he could haue done, to recouer his strength, so that within fiftéene daies he was throughly whole, and being able to beare Armor againe, determined to trauel towards y<SUP>e</SUP> inchaunted Castle, but first he thought good once more to try the Princesse, as you shall heare in the Chapter following.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. How the Knight of Fortune, made himselfe knowne to the Princesse <HI>Oliua,</HI> and hauing obtained her loue, departed towards the Inchaunted Castle, and how he was there ta∣ken prisoner.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Knight of Fortune, béeing throughly healed of his wounds which he had receiued in fighting with the Giant <HI>Latron,</HI> when as he deliuered the Princesse <HI>Oliua,</HI> and mind∣ing to make triall of the aduenture of the in∣chaunted Castle, one day finding the Princesse sollitarie, walking in the Pallace garden, came vnto her, and after salutations past betwéene them, began as followeth.</P>
<P>Most excellent &amp; beautious Princesse, if the cruell paines of a faithfull Louer, may any way mooue compassion in a Ladies hart, or the endlesse sighes and teares of a Knight wounded by <HI>Cupids</HI> shafts, may deserue to be pittied, then I beseech you Madam to behold him, that not onely langui∣sheth, but is euen ready, through the extreame passions
<PB REF="88"/> which I féele, to suffer death for your loue, béeing appoin∣ted by the Destinies to loue you, before euer I had sight of this your heauenly and diuine beauty, since which time it hath so increased in me, that I finde no other remedy if you prooue cruell, but death onely: which if you should, would be to me most welcome.</P>
<P>The Princesse hearing this, which vnto her was most pleasant, answered, Knight of Fortune, what other name to call you by I am vtterly ignorant of, the loue which you say you beare vnto me, may be great, neither doo I thinke the contrary, as the hazarding of your selfe to saue my life, I must néedes confesse deserues y<SUP>e</SUP> greatest recompence that I can bestow on you. But how farre vnfitting it is for one of my estate, to place my affection on a stranger, whose name nor Country I know not, yea peraduenture on such a one, who though now he seemes to loue, yet hauing gay∣ned what he séekes for, may as soone leaue me: but put case I were so fondly bent, as not looking before I leapt, should place my affection on you, doo you thinke, that eyther the King my Grandfather, or y<SUP>e</SUP> rest of my friends would giue consent to my choise, surely I am perswaded they would neuer yéeld thereto.</P>
<P>The Knight hauing attentiuely listned to her discourse, and withall noting her change of culler whilst that she was speaking, especially when shée séemed to make doubt of his constancie, replyed. Worthy Princesse, whose beautie ex∣celleth the most fayrest, and whose wisedome excelleth that beautie, my name, which vnto none since I left my owne Country I haue declared, is <HI>Iago,</HI> my natiue soile the Dut∣chie of <HI>Saxony</HI> where my aged Father gouerns, not know∣ing what is become of me his vnhappy sonne, who for the desire of séeking strange aduentures, stale secretly out of his Court, what since hath befalne me, I thinke partly by my selfe, and my Squire you haue already heard. But where you séeme to doubt of my loyaltie, I beséech God no longer to permit my life, then vnto you I proue faithfull: &amp; where∣as you likewise doubt your friends consents, thinke not but
<PB REF="89"/> both your Grandfather, yea and the Prince your Father likewise, who I doubt not ere long to sée at libertie, wil ea∣sily giue their consents, séeing you desirous to accord there∣to. The Princesse no longer able to conceale y<SUP>e</SUP> loue which she bare him, and knowing him to be the Prince of <HI>Saxo∣nie,</HI> whose forwardnesse long before by fame had béen bru∣ted in the <HI>French</HI> Court, together with that of his supposed Brother, the Gentleman of the Forrest, demaunded whe∣ther it were himselfe or his Brother, that had atchieued the aduenture of the inchaunted Sword. The Knight answe∣red that it was his supposed brother, whose absence was the chiefest cause of his trauell. And herewithall hee decla∣red vnto her, the strange finding of <HI>Euordanus,</HI> together with the great loue and affection betweene them, as is be∣fore declared: at which discourse the Princesse tooke great delight, and in the end, hauing fully resolued with herselfe, she was contented to take him for her husband. And ha∣uing thus vowed each to other fayth and loyaltie, hee tooke his leaue of her with many a chast kisse: the next day pre∣paring himselfe to trauell towards the inchaunted Castle, where within sixe dayes after hee arriued, reasonable be∣times in the morning. And béeing come euen to the Bridge foote, hee was willed by a Squire to passe no further, then presently came foorth the Giant <HI>Brandofell,</HI> mounted on a mightie Courser, bearing in his hand a Lance big enough to haue béen the Mast of a small shyppe. Which when the Knight of Fortune beheld, hee greatly admired the same, yet not béeing any thing afraid, he set spurres to his horse, addressing his shield, and placing his Launce in his rest, which he directed right against the Giants breast, who by reason of his huge stature, bare his Launce so hie, that cō∣ming together, he ranne the same cleane ouer his head, not so much as once touching him therewith: but the Knights Launce hitting in the midst of the Giants shielde, brake in∣to a thousand shiuers, causing the huge tower to bend back∣wards, but yet kéeping his saddle, they met together so fu∣riously with their bodies, that they were both horse &amp; men
<PB REF="89"/> tumbled to the ground, (to the great meruaile of the prince <HI>Don Edward</HI> and the other Knights, which were standing on the battlements of the Castle beholding the same, who greatly commended him in their harts,) then quickly re∣couering themselues, they drew foorth theyr swords, and comming together, they began a most cruell and dangerous combat: the Knight still fearing his mighty blowes, did of∣ten voyde the same by the quicknesse of his bodie: but yet many times receiued wound vppon wound, himselfe like∣wise giuing many.</P>
<P>Thus continued they the spare of two howres without any great aduantage to be discerned betwéene them: the Giant at length beginning to be out of breath, beganne to giue back a little, which the Knight perceiuing folowed him the faster, and the Giant still giuing back, hapned to stum∣ble on a péece of the Knights Launce, wherewith he fell to the ground: so that before he could recouer himselfe, he had receiued two great wounds, the one in his thigh, the other in his right arme, whereby (béeing againe gotten on his féete) he could not so well handle his Semiter as before hée did, which was soone the occasion that the Knight of For∣tune got the victorie, yet very déerly, for hauing the Giant at this aduantage, he determined to end the Combat quick∣ly, and croching neere, the better to giue a full blow at his head, he performed the same with such force, that hée caused him to tumble to the ground, receiuing withall so mightie a blow from the Giant on the right side, that cleauing his shield in two, he was thereby sore wounded in the shoulder and in his arme.</P>
<P>But euen as he was going to be reuenged thereof, by cutting of his head, the Gyant <HI>Furoll</HI> came vnto him, and by force taking him in his armes, doe what he could, he carried him into the Castle, where being disarmed, he had his wounds very carefully looked vnto, at the intreaty of the Prince, who greatly liked him for his vallour, which he had showed in the combat with <HI>Brandofell.</HI> And beeing cured of his wounds, was alwaies by the Prince held as
<PB REF="90"/> a companion, vnto whom hee declared the deliuery of his daughter from the Gyant <HI>Latron,</HI> and of the great sorrow which the Princesse <HI>Emilia</HI> indured for his imprisonment. All which was a great increase of the loue and amity bée∣tweene them, whereby they passed away the time of their imprisonment with y<SUP>e</SUP> greater content, which was not now very long: for God pittying the losse of so many braue and hardy Knights, sent not long after the imprisonment of the Knight of Fortune, the Knight of the Lions, and <HI>Adresto,</HI> as you shall heare héereafter. But first we will speake of the sorrow of the Court of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> for the sudden departure of their Prince.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the great sorrow that was made by the Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> &amp; the whole Court, when the Prince was found missing, and how by finding a Letter in his chamber window, it was knowne what was become of him.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Haue a long time forgotten to declare vnto you, the great sorrowe and griefe, which the noble Duke <HI>Mauris,</HI> the Dutches, and all the rest of the Court sustained, when the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> was found missing, which was the next day after his departure: for the Duke his fa∣ther finding him wanting the next day, demaunded where he was, as being giuen to vnderstād y<SUP>t</SUP> his Squire <HI>Stepha∣no,</HI> only in his companie departed towards the Sea side, &amp; that since they were not returned. Wherefore the Duke caused inquiry to be made for him, and hearing no certaine newes thereby, hee grew meruailous discontented there∣with: and comming into the Dutches her chamber, hée found both her and her daughter in as great perplexity, not knowing what to coniecture of his absence, and de∣maunding whether they knewe the cause thereof, the Dutches told him that since the departure of the Gentle∣man
<PB REF="90"/> of the Forrest, she had neuer séene her sonne to showe any content, &amp; being denied often to follow him in séeking strange aduentures, her minde did giue her, that hee was now departed by stelth, to follow that which otherwise hée could not be permitted to doe. The Duke being almost of the same opinion, beganne to rent his haire from his head, and to rage and take on mightily: the Dutches, his daugh∣ter, and all the rest that were present bearing him compa∣pany in his griefe, but euen as they were in y<SUP>e</SUP> midst of this sorrow: the Prince <HI>Iagos</HI> Chamberlaine came and brought a letter, which the Prince had left behind him in his cham∣ber windowe, the contents whereof followeth.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To my Soueraigne and louing Father the Duke of <HI>Saxonie.</HI></HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MOst high and mighty Prince and louing father, let not I beséech you, this my sudden and disobedient de∣parture, any way vex or trouble your noble minde, but consider and iudge of the same, not with this your ripe and stayed grauitie, but looke into the same with a remem∣brance of your more young and youthfull yéeres, when by your noble prowesse &amp; heroyick déedes of Armes, you cau∣sed all the Regions of <HI>Europe,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> to resound with y<SUP>e</SUP> eccho of your name: consider I beséech you, what a griefe it is to a noble and vallerous minde, to be kept alwaies in the bounds of his owne natiue Country, yea like a Hauke to be as it were cubbed vp in a mewe, and thinke withall I beséech you, what the world doth already, and will héere∣after say of me, if I should still spend my daies in this easie kind of life: will they not say that I doe degenerate from being sonne vnto so noble a Sire as your selfe, and that this effeminate bringing vp, vnder the winges of my mo∣ther, and in a Court giuen altogether vnto pleasure and idlenesse, will in the end be the only subuertion of this flo∣rishing estate, when it shall please God to call you hence vnto a more happy and delightfull life. Call to minde I
<PB REF="91"/> beséech you, the florishing state of the Romane Empire, and consider how many noble youths rose to honor by sloth and idlenesse: nay rather, were not by those meanes the ouerthrow of their families. What thinke you of <HI>Tar∣quinius Superbus,</HI> was not his sloth and effeminate liuing in his youth, the cause of his inordinate lust, and his lust the cause of his ruine. What shall I speake of <HI>Ne∣ro, Commodus,</HI> and diuers others whom I could recite, that only by effeminate &amp; ill education, degenerated from their noble predicessors: on the contrary side, looke into <HI>Caesar,</HI> the <HI>Catoes,</HI> yea and the <HI>Scipioes,</HI> who not lying at home, but euen in their childhood as it were, followed the warres to their great &amp; immortall fame. What shall I say farther, to commend the following of strange and hard ad∣uentures, considering that you already know the same bet∣ter then I can discribe: wherefore pardon I beséech you this my departure, which I doubt not will be prosperous vnto me, and to the future benifit of your Country. I haue directed my iourny into <HI>England,</HI> from thence I intend to trauell in search of my brother, the Gentleman of the For∣rest, in whose cōpany I doubt not but to gaine honor &amp; re∣nowne: thus beséeching the Almighty, to continue your aged yeares in peace and happinesse, I commit you into his protection.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Your vnworthy sonne, <HI>Don Iago.</HI></HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Duke hauing red this Letter, and now by the con∣tents thereof knowing certainly what was become of his sonne, was somewhat appeased of his griefe, and departing into his Closet, with more aduisednesse to consider of the contents thereof, began with reason to debate his sorrow, and hauing throughly wayed each matter with himselfe, he could not choose but in his hart highly commend the noble minde of his sonne, whom hee did not doubt but in time would prooue a famous Prince. Thus by little &amp; little the
<PB REF="91"/> old Duke recomforted himselfe, but the Dutches, and her daughter the Princesse <HI>Egisena,</HI> could not so soone shake of their sorrow, especially the Princesse, who now béeing de∣stitute of her Brothers company, and also wanting y<SUP>e</SUP> sight of her Louer, whose very absence was a hell vnto her, and whose returne she feared would be very long, by reason of his vow at his departure: which was not to rest in any place, vntill hee had found out his Parents. Many times would she debate with herselfe heereof, somewhiles imagi∣ning, that hee trauailing through so many strange Coun∣tries, might peraduenture be wonne to the loue of some more beautifull Dame: then would she run straight waies to behold herselfe in her glasse, and with the minds of ma∣ny women, thinking herselfe excéeding fayre, she would be∣gin to blame him of inconstancie: then suddenly reproouing herselfe for condemning him without true knowledge, shée would say, Ah <HI>Egisena,</HI> vnfortunate wench, how canst thou conceiue so ill a thought against him whom thou so déerely louest: O that it were lawfull for mee like a man to goe to séeke thée out, whereby to manifest the loue I beare thee, but alas I cannot, wherfore I will only direct my prayers vnto almighty GOD to preserue thée.</P>
<P>Thus would shée many times vnder cullour of lamen∣ting her Brothers absence, bewaile her friend, which toge∣ther with the griefe of the Dutches her mother, caused the whole Court to remaine a long time in heauines, giuing o∣uer all their former pastimes &amp; exercises of pleasure, where∣in the Court did very much abound. Héere againe will we leaue them to speake of other matters.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Knight of the Lyons and <HI>Adresto,</HI> hauing remained a long time at <HI>Water∣ford,</HI> staying for a winde to saile towards <HI>Spaine,</HI> whether the Knight of the Lyons determined to accompany <HI>Adresto,</HI> to sée if hee could by y<SUP>e</SUP> wise <HI>Adriano,</HI> learne any thing touching his parents, whom he as yet knew not: and now hauing remained by the space of eight wéekes idlely in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Marriners brought them newes of a North-east winde, wherefore making hast, bée∣ing furnished with all things néedfull for their voyage, they went aboord: and hauing hoised there sailes, they commit∣ted themselues to the mercy of the Seas, and the winde blowing a reasonable good gale, they soone had lost y<SUP>e</SUP> sight of the Irish land.

And being héere∣on concluded, they directed their course towards the For∣rest, where within tenne daies after they arriued, and bée∣ing at length come to the Castle, in the morning some∣what early, hauing rested themselues the night before in a Village on the edge of the Forrest: where they were giuen to vnderstand, of the great vallour of the Knight of For∣tune, who some fiftéene daies before was taken prisoner, whose losse was greatly bewailed in y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>French</HI> Court: the Knights being as I haue sayd come vnto the Castle, had not long stayed, before such time as <HI>Brandosell</HI> beeing throughly cured of his wounds, which hee had receaued of the Knight of Fortune, came foorth mounted on his won∣ted Courser, at whose hugenesse both y<SUP>e</SUP> Knights did great∣ly wonder, yet not being any whit dismaide, <HI>Adresto</HI> accor∣ding to their agréement, tooke the other part of the field a∣gainst him, and setting spurres to their horses, they met together with such fury, that breaking their Launces to péeces, they passed on halfe astonied: &amp; hauing ended their course, <HI>Adresto</HI> turning his horse drew foorth his sword: but the Gyant who neuer before had fought on horse-back, was going to alight, which <HI>Adresto</HI> perceauing, called vn∣to him, telling him it was not the part of a Knight to for∣sake his horse, as long as he was able to kéepe him on his backe. Which the Gyant hearing, and thinking with him∣selfe, that if fighting on horse-backe, hee should find any disaduantage, hee might easily sley his enemies horse, it caused him drawing his heauy Semiter to vse these spéeches. Knight, I was willing to haue delayed thy death for a while, which on foote might haue béene deferred by thy quicknesse: but now séeing it is thy own doings to fight on horse-backe, blame none but thy selfe for thy folly. Then comming both together, the Gyant had thought to haue deliuered a blow vpon his shield, but <HI>Adresto</HI> being very wary auoyded the same by the quicke shifting of his horse, giuing the Gyant a mighty blow on the right side, which
<PB REF="93"/> he taking with his shield, slyced away a great part thereof. Which the Giant perceiuing, wondred at his strength, so likewise did Prince <HI>Edward, Don Iago,</HI> and many other hardy Knights, who stoode on the battlement of the Castle to behold the combat, greatly commending the braue ma∣naging of <HI>Adresto.</HI></P>
<P>But Prince <HI>Edward</HI> casting his eye on the Knight of the Lyons, who was still sitting on horsebacke, began to haue a meruailous opinion of him, so y<SUP>e</SUP> turning to <HI>Iago</HI> hee said: that if his mind did not misdéeme, that Knight on horseback was the better of the two, and that if they did both fayle in this attempt, it was in vaine for them euer to expect deliue∣rance. Now had <HI>Adresto</HI> and the Giant, continued theyr battell by the space of halfe an howre on horsebacke, both of them hauing receiued many wounds, but especially the Giant, who for want of skill receiued many more then o∣therwise he néeded to haue doone: which caused him to fret and chafe excéedingly. And béeing minded to delay y<SUP>e</SUP> fight no longer, he raised himselfe in his stirrups, and deliuered a full blow at his enemies head, who séeing it comming, and béeing afraid to take the same, hee lightly raind backe his horse, so that the Giant missing his marke, was not able to recouer his blow, which lighted so fully on his owne horse head, that he cleft it in two, and therewithall tumbled him∣selfe to the ground: but as great hap was, he fréed himselfe so well in the fal, that before <HI>Adresto</HI> could take any aduan∣tage against him, he had recouered his féete, which he per∣ceiuing, likewise allighted, and addressing himselfe, they began a more fierce combat then that on horsebacke, the Giant still hauing the worst, till at last, <HI>Adresto</HI> stepping backe to auoyde a blow which the Giant made at him, hée vnluckily stumbled, and withall fell to the ground, recei∣uing in the fall a great wound on his right thigh, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, and fearing the death of his friend, he leapt lightly from his horse, and came to saue him, which was doone with such spéede, that y<SUP>e</SUP> Giant could not execute the crueltie which otherwise he would, but was
<PB REF="93"/> forced to turne about to defend himselfe from his newe ad∣uersary: who beganne to deliuer him such blowes, as made the beholders soone iudge who should haue the victory. For he gaue not one blow in vaine, but it did eyther breake in peeces his Armor, or wound his body, which now through losse of blood began to grow weake. On the contrary side, his blowes which he gaue vnto the Knight, had not y<SUP>e</SUP> force so much as once to pierce his shielde, so impregnable was the strength thereof, which caused the Giant to curse and blaspheme his Gods, who were not able to deliuer him frō one alone Knight. And béeing in this rage, he thought with one blow to haue finished the battell, wherefore vniting all his forces together, he strake the Knight such a blow on the shield, that had it béen of any other mettell, he had cleft it in the midst, but to this it did no harme at all, but with that blow he brake his Semiter, causing the Knight to set one knée to the ground: but béeing againe recouered, hee pur∣sued the Giant with such fierce blowes, that soone he caused him to fall at his féete: which <HI>Furioll</HI> perceiuing, cryed vnto him to saue his life, but the Knight not séeming to harken vnto him, cut off his head.</P>
<P>The Giant <HI>Furioll</HI> séeing his companion slaine, drew forth a mighty broad Fauchon, and running at the knight said: Villaine, wherfore hast thou slaine him that was not able to defend himselfe, I hauing likewise cryed vnto thee to haue spared him, but séeing thou hast so cruely dealt with him, I will send thy soule for a sacrifice vnto him. Doe thy worst replyed the Knight, for I slew him because I did not feare thée: and if thou looke not the better to thy selfe, I doubt not but to send thée to beare him company with the dead, whom liuing y<SUP>u</SUP> hast béen a companion vnto in many mischiefes, then hurling together, they beganne a cruell combat.</P>
<P>The Knight hauing borne some two or thrée of his wei∣tie blowes, (which although by the goodnes of his Armour did not wound his body, yet were they of such force y<SUP>t</SUP> they did compell him to bend with his knées to the ground, and
<PB REF="94"/> now minding with himselfe to auoyde the same) began to round &amp; trauerse his ground, often auoyding his enemies force, &amp; indangering his huge body both with blowes and thrusts, which hee gaue with such good and skilfull know∣ledge, that the blood issued foorth abundantly, to the great ioy and admiration of the <HI>English</HI> Prince, and the rest of the prisoners, who in a manner héereby were in assurance of their deliuery: wondring in theyr minds what he might be, that with such force was able to cōtend with the Giant <HI>Furioll.</HI> Thus continued they fighting by the space of two howres, not so much as once taking breath, whereby the Knight had the aduantage, as béeing more vsed to such combats then the Giant, who now was in a manner cleane wearied, and so farre out of breath, that he did nothing but pant and blow, which the Knight perceiuing, pursued him the faster, dealing such blowes with the trustie blade of <HI>A∣driano,</HI> that caused his body to lie open to the keene edge thereof, so that the grasse wheron they fought, was cleane couered with his blood, himselfe not hauing giuen any woūd to his aduersay, although in many places he had bru∣sed his Armor: and now béeing ouercharged with his ene∣mies blowes, and growing faint through his great phle∣bottomy, fell to the ground in a swound. The Knight thinking to haue slaine him, was called vnto to hasten vnto the wicket, which if he did not make y<SUP>e</SUP> greater spéed, would be closed against him, wherefore leauing the Giant swel∣tring in his owne blood, he ranne vnto the gate, and finding one closing the wicket against him, he gaue him such a blow that he cleft him to the breast: and entring in, hee began to deale his dole amongst thē that made any resistance, which were not many.</P>
<P>Then came vnto him the <HI>English</HI> Prince <HI>Don Iago</HI> and y<SUP>e</SUP> rest, giuing him infinit thankes for his great paines, which hee had taken for their deliuery: desiring him to put off his Helme, that they might see his face and knowe him, who had so nobly wrought their deliuerance. The Knight beeing loth to deny their request, especially that of y<SUP>e</SUP> Prince
<PB REF="94"/> <HI>Iago,</HI> whom hee perfitly knew, and of whose being there he did not a little meruaile, whithout any more ceremo∣nies put of his Helme. But when the whole company be∣held his young yeares and great beauty, which by his heate was the more augmented, they did greatly admire his rare prowesse: but what man liuing is able to expresse the excéeding ioy, which the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> inioyed when hée beheld him: who running presently vnto him, imbrast him in his armes, saying. O brother, how happy am I so inioy this your presence in a time so néedfull: whose absence hath béen a greater griefe vnto me then my tongue can expresse. The Knight of the Lions being as glad to sée him, vsed him with the like kindnesse, demaunding by what aduenture he came thether, and how the Duke his father, his Mother, and the Princesse his sister fared, all which was deferred vntill a more conuenient time. Then was hee imbraced of the Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> and the rest, at whose intreaty he pardoned Sir <HI>Pestrell</HI> the Dukes Cosin: and for the courtisie which hee had showed them, during their imprisonment, they vsed him very kindly. Then the Knight of the Lions commaunded <HI>Adresto</HI> to be sent for, and his wounds to be dressed, declaring vnto the Prince <HI>Iago,</HI> that it was the same Knight for whom he left <HI>Saxonie</HI> to goe into <HI>Ireland</HI> to combat with all. Héere after they had rested themselues by the space of fiue daies, hauing sent word of this fortunate deliuerance, to y<SUP>e</SUP> Court of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> they determined altogether to ride thether, where in thrée daies they arriued with easie iournies, by reason of the wounds of <HI>Adresto.</HI> And at their comming foorth of the Castle, with a mighty clap of thunder, the Castle and dead bodies of the Gyants were vanisht cleane out of sight, to the great astonishment of them all.</P>
<P>And now being as I haue sayd come to the Citty of <HI>Par∣ris,</HI> they were royally welcomed, and intertained by the King, the Quéene, the Princesse <HI>Emilia, Oliua:</HI> and all Nobles of the Court, vnto whom the Prince of <HI>England,</HI> declared the whole discourse of euery particuler accedent,
<PB REF="95"/> touching their imprisonment and deliuery. Which when the King had heard, he made a solemne vow to be reuenged on the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and his whole family: but at the intreaty of the Prince, he pardoned Sir <HI>Pestrell,</HI> who af∣terwards prooued a good and hardy Knight. Thus passed they away the time in the <HI>French</HI> Court, by the space of thrée wéekes, each friend recounting to other their seuerall aduentures, and making preparation for the solemnizing of the marriage betwéene Prince <HI>Edward</HI> &amp; the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> in which time <HI>Adresto</HI> was fully recouered of his wounds, and being desirous to see his old loue the Dutches <HI>Lenarda,</HI> hastned on the Knight of the Lions to depart: whereunto he was very willing, by reason of the desire he had to speake with <HI>Adriano.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. How the Knight of the Lions, departing from the <HI>French</HI> Court with <HI>Adresto,</HI> landed in <HI>Holland,</HI> where comming to the Castle of <HI>Coruew,</HI> hee deliuered the King his Fa∣ther.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Nd now beeing ready prouided to depart, they came both into the great Hall, where with many ceremonious courtisies, they tooke their leaue of the King, y<SUP>e</SUP> Quéene, the Princesse <HI>Emilia,</HI> and <HI>Oliua,</HI> with all the rest of the Nobles of the Court. The two Princes, <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> and <HI>Iago,</HI> séeing they would néedes depart, accom∣panied them two daies iourny onwards on their way, during which time the Prince <HI>Iago</HI> desiring pardon of his brother, for not bearing him company, made knowne vnto him his loue to the Princesse <HI>Oliua,</HI> which by his abode in Court, he doubted not but to obtaine, considering the great loue and amity, which was betwéene him and her father. The Knight of the Lions being well contented héerewith, desired him at his returne, or sending into <HI>Saxonie,</HI> to re∣member his duty to the Duke, and Ductches, and his
<PB REF="95"/> beautifull sister the Princesse <HI>Egisena,</HI> whom hee intirely loued: assuring him that as soone as he could learne any certainty, of that which he now went to séeke for, he would returne thether likewise, which hee did not doubt but would hapen very shortly. Then taking their leaue of each other, with many kind imbracements, the Prince <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> most earnestly intreated him, to sée him at his re∣turne out of <HI>Spaine</HI> at the <HI>English</HI> Court, to which he easi∣ly consented. Thus they departed, y<SUP>e</SUP> two Princes towards y<SUP>e</SUP> Court, &amp; the Knight of the Lions &amp; <HI>Adresto,</HI> towards the Sea-side, where their ship remained for them: where bée∣ing arriued, and setting into Sea, they sailed merrily by the space of two daies, but on the third day the wind al∣tring, and the Seas growing very foule, they were forced to put to hull: and being thus tost to and fro by the wind and Seas, by the space of fiue daies, they were at last put on shore on the coast of the Dutchy of <HI>Holland:</HI> where go∣ing on shore, and taking their horses and Armor, minding a little to take the aire after their storme at Sea, they rode onwards in a narrow way, fast by a pleasant groues side, where they heard one very pittifully weeping, and listning attentiuely, they might heare these few words pronounced. And is it possible that God will suffer such cruell and iniust customes to continue, to the destruction of so many braue and hardie Knights, as haue béene by this wicked custome of <HI>Coruew</HI> destroyed. O false and disloy∣all <HI>Griffory,</HI> that fearing to shew thy malice openly, hast ordained so vild a custome.</P>
<P>The two Knights hearing this complaint, and imagi∣ning thereby y<SUP>t</SUP> there was some cause extraordinary which mooued the party so to complaine, alighted, and went into the Groue, where they found a Squire lying on the earth, his face all blubbred with teares, and demaunding him the cause of his sorrow, was giuen by him to vnderstand of the custome of <HI>Coruew,</HI> where not long since the Duke of <HI>Lit∣senburge</HI> his Lord and Maister, hauing bin by the space of 20. yéeres trauelling in search of his soueraigne, the noble
<PB REF="96"/> King <HI>Frederick</HI> of Denmark, during which time he had ac∣complished many great and hardy déedes of Armes, and now returning home into his owne Country, with intent no longer to séeke after y<SUP>e</SUP> which was impossible to be found, trauailing along by a Castle not passing a daies iourney hence, where the Duke of this Country hath erected a cu∣stome, that no Knight shall passe that way, but first he shall leaue his horse and Armor behind him, vnlesse hee conquer the Gardants, which is a thing impossible, because of the number: and then he declared the fame as it is more at large expressed in the first part of this history.</P>
<P>The Knight of the Lyons and <HI>Adresto</HI> hearing of this custome, and greatly pittying the losse of so many hardie Knights as were there daily imprisoned, beganne to grow into a great longing to make triall of the same: wherefore sending backe <HI>Gillimo</HI> vnto the ship for such things as they wanted, and to giue direction to the Marriners, that if with in ten dayes they did not returne, that then they should di∣rect their course for <HI>Spayne,</HI> whether they would peraduen∣ture trauell by Land: and willing <HI>Gillimo</HI> to follow them with as much spéede as hee could, they departed towards <HI>Coruew,</HI> that night lying at a Village not passing a league and a halfe from the Castle. And the next day early in the morning hauing heard Diuine seruice, and taking a small repast, they rode directly towards the Castle. <HI>Adresto</HI> ha∣uing desired to make the first triall of his vallour, and now beeing come vnto the place where the Shield hung at the bridge-foote, <HI>Adresto</HI> strooke the same so hard and rudely with the blunt end of his Launce, that he caused the whole Vally to resound with the noyse thereof. Presently issued foorth one of the Knights gardants, and mounting on his horse, came vnto <HI>Adresto</HI> demaunding what hee sought. Entrance aunswered <HI>Adresto,</HI> which if it be denied I will purchase with my sword. Then setting spurres to theyr horses, they met together with such fury, that the Knight of the bridge was sent headlong to the ground: and after him came foorth another, who was likewise sent to beare him
<PB REF="96"/> company, breaking his necke with the fall, <HI>Adresto</HI> neuer so much as once moouing in his saddle: and to be briefe, so good was his hap, that with one speare hee dismounted the first fiue Knights, not any of them béeing able to rise from the ground. Then taking choice of a fresh horse, and a new Launce, for that his old one was remaining broken in the body of him whom hee last dismounted, hee went on to the farther end of the Bridge, where he found two of the other fiue ready mounted, and vailing their Launces, they ranne together in such sort, that breaking both their Launces on his shield, it caused him a little to stagger: but he with whō <HI>Adresto</HI> met, was sent to measure his length on y<SUP>e</SUP> ground, then encountring with the other againe, hee ran his launce cleane through his body, himselfe béeing a little wounded on the right side.</P>
<P>Then taking a new Launce, hee prepared to runne a∣gainst the other thrée, but before he ranne, the Knight of the Lyons intreated him to giue ouer the Iousts to him, as be∣ing more fresh and lustie: but héereunto <HI>Adresto</HI> would not in any sort agrée, but desired him to permit him to end the aduenture if he could: and if hee did faile therein, then that he would procéede in the same himselfe. And héerewithall againe he sette spurres to his horse, and encountring with them all thrée at once, gaue him that was on the right side of him such a blow, that he caused him to fall ouer his horse taile: but the other two méeting him fully at one instant, brake theyr Launces in the midst of his shield, causing both horse and man to tumble to the ground, but soone had hee recouered his féete, and was againe remounted by his Squire, who brought him his owne horse, &amp; presented him with a Launce. Then béeing mounted, he incountred a∣gaine with the other two, who at the second course he like∣wise sent to beare theyr fellowes company, himselfe béeing sore brused and wounded in two or thrée places of the body, wherby he lost a great deale of blood: and likewise his horse was so ouerwearied, that hee was no longer able to beare his body. Wherfore he dismounted, minding to haue chan∣ged
<PB REF="97"/> his horse, but as hee was so dooing, hee espied the fiue Knights with whom he was to deale withall comming to∣wards him on foote, wherfore drawing forth his sword, and dressing his shield on his arme, he went against them with a most bold and vndaunted courage: and béeing come to∣gether, was the first that gaue the onset, which hee perfor∣med with such inestimable prowesse, that within lesse then twenty blowes, he had sent one of them to séeke passage of old <HI>Caron:</HI> the rest perceiuing the death of theyr fellow, be∣gan with more furie to assault him, whereby he was driuen to his trumps, for they were all foure stoute and hardy Knights. Thus continued the fight by the space of an howre, many wounds béeing giuen on both sides, so that the ground was all couered with blood: and now <HI>Adresto</HI> féeling himselfe grieuously wounded, &amp; his strength through wearisomnesse &amp; losse of blood to decrease, minding to shew courage to the end, vnited all his forces together, and de∣termining to end his life with honour, ranne fiercely vpon them, giuing one of them such a blow on the head, that hée cleft him to the téeth: then turning to another of them who had wounded him behind, gaue him such a discharge, that for euer after he was frée from any more such combats, ha∣uing both his armes cut off. The other two séeing this, and fearing the like, would willingly if they could haue desisted frō the battel: but he pursued them with so mighty blowes, that at length they fell both at his féete, the one of thē starke dead, the other crying for mercy, which he obtained.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Adresto</HI> béeing very faint, sate downe on y<SUP>e</SUP> grasse, which the Knight of the Lyons perceiuing, came towards him to helpe him, but before hée could come vnto him, <HI>A∣dresto</HI> was falne into a swound: wherefore commending him vnto their Squires, hee prepared himselfe against the other fiue Knights, which by this time were come euen vn∣to him: and at the first incounter, gaue one of them so rude a blow, that cutting away both shoulder and right arme, hée caused him to fall dead to the ground, then turning to ano∣ther, he tooke of at one blow his head.</P>
<PB REF="97"/>
<P>The other thrée séeing this, beset him round about, lay∣ing at him withall their force, which was far weake to doe him any hurt: so impierceable was his Armor, which at this time stoode him in good stéede, for hee being sure from wounding, néeded not to take any paines but only in of∣fending, which he did with such agillity, that in lesse then halfe an houre, hee had sent them all to séeke passage into another world. Then had he time a little to breath himselfe, and also to sée <HI>Adresto,</HI> who by this time, by the carefull industrie of the Squires, was come to himselfe againe, and had his wounds bound vp, being somewhat weake and fainty, with his great losse of blood which he sustained. And now the Knight of the Lions, séeing there was no great doubt of his recouery, went towards the Castle, to prouoke the Gardants, if otherwise they would not com foorth, to the battaile.</P>
<P>But euen as hee was come to the gate, fiue whose lot was next to fight came foorth, and all at once set on him, but he like a second <HI>Hercules,</HI> amidst the eleauen Gyant-like brethren, first receaued al their blowes vpon his shield, to try the strength of their armes, and hauing once felt the weight of all their forces, he directed his sword against him, whose blowes hee thought might doe him the greatest da∣mage: and giuing him a full blow beneath the shield, par∣ted him right in the wast, then laying on amongst them with equall dole, he made from some their heads, from o∣thers their armes and legges to fly into the field. And now foure of them being kild in the place, the other beganne to fly as fast as he could towards the wicked, but before hée could attaine halfe of the way, the Knight of the Lions o∣uertooke him, &amp; gaue him so full a blow vpon the head, that he cleft him downe to the girdle: to the amazement of the beholders, who stoode vpon the battlements of the Castle, almost fearing to goe foorth to fight with him, but being vrged, both by their oath, and also by the commaundement of their Captaine, the nex fiue went foorth, but were in a manner no sooner issued, but that they sought meanes to
<PB REF="98"/> returne againe, such incredible feare had they of his weigh∣ty blowes. But hée séeing their intent, and minding to pre∣uent the same, got lighty betwéene the gate and them: and now hauing already slaine thrée of them, and woun∣ded the other two, hee beganne to fall into consideration with himselfe, that if he did not take the time, whiles it pre∣sented it selfe vnto him to enter into the Castle, he might when he would, peraduenture be bard of the like oportu∣nitie. And considering withall the goodnesse of his Armor, &amp; vnwillingnesse of the defendants to come foorth, determi∣ned to enter whilst the wicket was open: wherefore step∣ping a little to the right hand, he gaue one of them so sore a blow on the left shoulder, that caused him to fall to the ground, and héerewithall hee lept suddenly to the wicket, and got in thereat: which they of the Castle perceauing, and with all fearing the sequell, bee ganne to arme them∣selues, and all at once to assault him, some with swords, o∣ther with Launces, some others againe betooke them to throwing of stones, &amp; diuers engines of iron at him, where with he was greatly troubled. But seeing no remedy, but either to conquer or die, he couered himselfe with his shield, and with his trusty blade in his hand, hee made such way amongst them, that he thought himselfe surest, that was farthest off from him: so that within y<SUP>e</SUP> space of two houres, he had not left aboue sixe of them liuing: all which were likewise very sore wounded, &amp; beeing vtterly voyd of hope to escape his conquering arme, determined to submit themselues to his mercy, hoping thereby to saue their liues, which otherwise they could not long preserue. Wherefore falling on their knées, with one voice they cra∣ued mercy, which he soone graunted vnto them, being as I haue many times before said, naturally inclined to pitty. And willing them to stand vp, hee demaunded what priso∣ners there were in the Castle, and for what occasion that custome was there erected: all which one of them at large recounted, declaring how that the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> as yet remained there, with diuers other noble and gallant
<PB REF="98"/> Knights. Which when the Knight of the Lions heard, hée commaunded straight waies to be conducted vnto the pri∣son: and likewise that <HI>Adresto</HI> should be brought in, and his wounds dressed by the Surgian of the Castle, which was a man greatly experienced in that science, all which was presently performed. And one of the Knights running to one of them that was slaine, tooke from him a bunch of keyes, wherewith he opened a little iron doore, and discen∣ding downe a narrow paire of staiers, they came to a dun∣gion vnderground, at the entry whereof was another iron doore, which they likewise opened: then hauing a torch lighted in their hands, they vnchained all the prisoners, amongst whom they found King <HI>Frederick,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> Lord <HI>Gwal∣tero</HI> his Cosin: the Duke of <HI>Litsenburge,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Me∣new,</HI> Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> and diuers others, to the number of a hundred, all or most part Knights of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> Many of which were sore pined away, and almost famished through their extreame griefe and course fare: but the King, the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> were little or nothing altred for all their long imprisonment. And now being all brought foorth into the great Hall of the Castle, they with one ac∣cord gaue harty thankes vnto the Knight of the Lions, and then falling on their knées, with one consent they gaue praises to almighty God, which being ended: the King with the noble men came vnto the Knight of the Lions, desiring him to declare who hee was, that they were so much bound vnto for their deliuerance. To which hee aun∣swered, that hee was commonly called the Knight of the Lions: But as touching his parents or Country, he knew not, only this he had heard, that being a child, he was ta∣ken vp in a Forrest, in the Kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> who since that time had carefully brought him vp as his sonne. Which when the King had heard hée imbrast him in his armes, desiring him to accompany him into his Kingdome, where hee would showe himselfe so thankfull vnto him, as hee should not thinke his labour ill bestowed. The Knight beeing by the instinct of nature,
<PB REF="99"/> greatly affected vnto the King, soone consented héereto, al∣though it were farre out of his way towards <HI>Spaine,</HI> whe∣ther he was trauelling. For which the King gaue him har∣ty thankes, and withall beganne to haue an inward loue towards him: héere continued they by the space of eight or tenne daies, to refresh their weake bodies, as also for the curing of the wounds of <HI>Adresto,</HI> and making preparation for their Armors, whereof they had great store in the Ca∣stle, &amp; some horses: others they got abroade in the Coun∣try néere adioyning for their monies. And now hearing that <HI>Grifforie</HI> was gathering his forces to come against them, they departed towards <HI>Flaunders,</HI> where hearing of the warres and rebellion in <HI>Denmarke,</HI> they determined vnknowne to hasten thether, and naming themselues to be all Knights arrant, met together by chance: and hea∣ring of these warres were, minded to entertaine them∣selues in the armie of the States. With this determination arriued they at the Citty of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> which was still held by the <HI>Danes:</HI> and héere they remained, to prouide themselues of such things as they néeded.</P>

How King <HI>Fredericke,</HI> the Knight of the Lyons, and the rest of theyr company, arriued in the Army of the States, and how the next day they gaue battell vnto the <HI>Scots,</HI> where, by the vallour of the King, the Knight of the Lyons, and theyr company, the States got the victory, and howe the King made himselfe knowne.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He King and the rest of his company, ha∣uing prouided themselues of all things ne∣cessary for theyr iourney, departed from <HI>Gaunt</HI> towards <HI>Denmarke,</HI> béeing in all to the number of an hundred Knights, wel furnished and prouided for the warre. And marching thus together through <HI>Flaunders,</HI> and other pro∣uinces of <HI>Germany,</HI> they arriued within thirtie dayes at
<PB REF="99"/> <HI>Rensberge,</HI> where the two Armies by the space of sixe daies had line incamped one against the other, continually skir∣mishing, but neither side daring the one to assault y<SUP>e</SUP> other. And now béeing héere arriued, the King and the rest béeing disguised for feare of being knowne, came vnto the States, desiring entertainement, and withall, declared a long fai∣ned circumstance how they had met together: and béeing all minded to ayde theyr right and iust cause against the <HI>Scots</HI> and traytors, they were come together to proffer their seruices. The States béeing glad of this succor, and with∣all knowing diuers of them, as the Duke of <HI>Litsenburge,</HI> and others, whom they receiued with great ioy, and gaue entertainment to all the rest, who by the meanes of the Duke were placed in commaund: and entring into coun∣sell, they determined to send presently vnto the <HI>Scots</HI> to de∣maund battell, which by the Earle <HI>Dowglasse</HI> was soone graunted: and the next day it was appointed that it should be tryed by a pitched battell who should haue the victory.</P>
<P>The morning béeing come, and both Armies ranged in the field, the States had deuided their forces into thrée bat∣talions, the first whereof was ledde by the Lord <HI>Louden,</HI> and the County of <HI>Mildrope,</HI> containing eight thousand, the second or maine battell, was ledde by the Duke of <HI>Lit∣senburge,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Opencade,</HI> containing twelue thousand, the third &amp; last battalion, contayning nine thou∣sand, was led by the Lord <HI>Itzenho,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Rens∣berge.</HI> The King, the Knight of the Lyons, with their cō∣pany, &amp; some others, to the number of two hundred, would not at all ioyne themselues with any of the troopes, but in a loose manner, would make a tryall to breake in on y<SUP>e</SUP> backs of their enemies as soone as the battell should begin: each one of thē for their better knowledge to theyr friends, wea∣ring on their Helmes a crosse of gréene and corronation co∣loured silke: in this sort was ranged the whole battell of the States.</P>
<P>On the contrary side, the Earle <HI>Dowglasse</HI> placed his Army in another maner, making as it were but one maine
<PB REF="100"/> battaile of his whole Armie, in the midst whereof he placed for his owne gard fiue thousand <HI>Scots:</HI> the rest he intermix∣ed with the <HI>Danes,</HI> the greatest part whereof hee placed in the forefront of the battaile: his wings consisted most of a light kind of people, which did vse to cast Darts, beeing ar∣med onely with a short sword and target, with which when they came to ioyne blowes, they did great spoyle to theyr e∣nemies.</P>
<P>And now both Armies béeing thus ranged in battaile a∣ray, the Drummes &amp; Trumpets sounded, making a most ioyfull sound, to them whose harts not daunted with feare desired to incounter with their enemies: euery Captaine incouraging his men to fight valiantly, and to doe their best to winne the victory. The chiefe of the states incouraging theyr souldiers with the iustice of theyr cause, as beeing vr∣ged to fight for their fréedome and liberty of their Country. By this time were both Armies come together, the Lord <HI>Louden</HI> giuing the first charge vpon his enemies, brake his Launce valiantly, and drawing out his sword, beeing fol∣lowed by his company, made way through his enemies ranks, but soone he was stopped from going farre: and had it not béene, that the Duke of <HI>Litsenbege,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Opencade</HI> came with fresh succours, they had béene all put to the sword. For the <HI>Scots</HI> séeing the violent rashnesse of the Lord <HI>Louden</HI> and the Count <HI>Mildrope,</HI> opened theyr ranks of purpose, and hauing suffered them to enter▪ inclo∣sed them round about, but now at the cōming of the Duke, the battell began to grow very hote, insomuch that there were many slaine of both sides.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> euer kéeping themselues close together, made themselues the stronger, whereas the States for want of skill and knowledge, suffered theyr troopes to breake theyr ranks, to theyr great dammage. Which the Earle <HI>Dow∣glasse</HI> perceiuing, with some twelue or fouretéene thousand entred in amongst thē, making great slaughter where they went. The Earle this day shewing that his yéeres had not any way taken away the vallor which in his former dayes
<PB REF="100"/> he had showed, for it was thought y<SUP>t</SUP> this day hee slew with his owne hands aboue thréescore Knights.</P>
<P>Now beganne the <HI>Danes</HI> to fly, trusting rather to their héeles then the defence of their swords, which the Lord <HI>Itzenho,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Rensberge</HI> perceauing, came in with the rereward, and againe renewed the fight, which before was almost ended, gathering together the disperced troops of the Duke. But alas to small purpose had this their new onset béene, had it not béene that the King with his company of Venturers, hauing fetched about a great hill, which lay on the side of the battaile, came at the same in∣stant on the backe of their enemies, and withall their might charging them, entred pell mell amongst them, killing a great many, before such time as they could turne their fa∣ces, to knowe from whence this mischiefe came. The King accompanied with the Knight of the Lions, <HI>Adresto,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> made a plaine way for the rest to follow them, especially the Knight of the Lions, who neuer strake stroke but was either the death or dismembring of some Knight. The Lord of <HI>Menew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henault,</HI> did likewise the part of noble Knights: so as in short space the odds beganne to appeare on the side of the States, who be∣fore were euen vanquished. Which when the Earle <HI>Dowglasse</HI> sawe and grieuing to behold, he with his elec∣ted company came to make head, where he sawe most dan∣ger, and perceauing that the Knight of their Lions, was in a manner the whole ouerthrow of his Armie, hée set spurres to his horse, and comming vnto him, gaue him a great blowe on his Helme, causing him to bend his head forwards. But he soone requited the same, for lifting vp his sword, he gaue the Earle such a blowe, that had he not warded the same with his shield, hee had ended therewith his life, for notwithstanding his defence, it caused him to fall from his horse in a traunce, and so was taken prisoner: to the great discouragement of the whole Armie, who pre∣sently put themselues to flight, but were so hotly persued, that they were but few that escaped, but were either slaine
<PB REF="101"/> or taken prisoners. Of men of name, there was slaine of the States the Duke of <HI>Litsenburge,</HI> the Lord <HI>Londen,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Mildrope.</HI> And of the <HI>Scots</HI> &amp; traytors, there was slaine Sir <HI>Iames Lewrence</HI> the Earles Cosin, the Lord <HI>Crecon</HI> a Scot, and the Count <HI>Hermes,</HI> with some twenty thousand of the Commons. There was taken pri∣soners the Earle <HI>Dowglasse,</HI> the Vicount Barwicke, the Archbishop of <HI>Maiance,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Harding,</HI> which two latter, were the next day executed for their rebellion.</P>
<P>Thus the victory béeing obtained by the States, they gaue thanks to GOD with publique &amp; solemne prayers, then causing the wounded to be cured, they called a coun∣sell to determine on their affaires, where all the chiefe of the Armie béeing assembled, euery man commended the great vallour of the Venturers, but especially that of the Knight of the Lyons, the gréene Knight which was <HI>Adresto,</HI> and the two tawny Knights, whereof the one was the King, the other the Lord <HI>Gwaltero.</HI></P>
<P>The King now séeing it was not good longer to conceale himselfe, stoode foorth in the midst of the Assembly, and ta∣king of his Helme, discouering his face, spake with a reso∣nable loude voyce.</P>
<P>My friends &amp; welbeloued Countrimen, I perceaue the long absence of your King, hath worne out in many theyr naturall loue &amp; obedience which they ought to haue to theyr natiue Country: and also in most of you the knowledge of me, who by the prouidence of God, and vallour of this no∣ble Knight, (poynting to the Knight of the Lyons) am de∣liuered from a long and grieuous imprisonment, which my Cosin <HI>Gwaltero,</HI> and many others héere present can well witnesse, and now am come vnto the ayde of you my true and louing Subiects. Wherefore it is my will, that the chiefe of those conspirators who haue raised this rebellion, be to morrow next (to the example of all others) hangd, drawne and quartered.</P>
<P>The whole Assembly hearing &amp; séeing theyr King, who for the space of twenty yéeres they all imagined to be dead,
<PB REF="101"/> with one voyce cryed aloude, <HI>Long liue King <HI>Fredericke</HI> to raine and rule ouer vs,</HI> and withall, ranne each striuing to come first to kisse his hands, and welcome him into his kingdome: greatly desiring to heare the cause of his long absence, which was deferred till some other more conueni∣ent time. This newes was presently spred through the whole Army, to the great ioy of all men, which they eui∣dently shewed by their shoutes and bonfires which they made that night. The next day, the King hauing séene the execution of the chiefe Traytors, and pardoning the rest, dismissing all his Army, sauing some few, which he sent to the Townes that were in rebellion, which presently yéel∣ded vnto his mercie, he departed towards <HI>Maiance,</HI> hauing still in his company the Knight of the Lyons and <HI>Adresto,</HI> whom he intirely loued, and to whom he made many large proffers, if they pleased to haue stayed in his kingdome. And being come to <HI>Maiance,</HI> he was receiued with the grea∣test ioy that might be by the Cittizens, where he remained by the space of a month, in the greatest ioy that hart could wish: saue onely the remembrance of his Quéene did some∣thing hinder the fulnes thereof, which was awhile swéetned with the delightfull company of his vnknowne sonne, where I will leaue them, and so conclude the second part of this history.</P>
