<OPENER><SALUTE>Right honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to the last Orders of the States of Holland, Vantrump put forth to Sea (with the Fleet which before he lay with all between the Earle of WAR∣VVICK, and the revolted Ships) the 9. of this instant November, this gave us some far∣ther assurance, besides the promises they for∣merly made to us, that no interruption would be given us, but that we might with∣out disturbance use our utmost endeavours in accomplishing the Parliaments and Kingdomes service, which we are about, and for effecting thereof, no sooner was Vantrump put out to Sea, but the Lord Ad∣mirall waighed Anchor, and sailed quite up into the Creeke almost as high as Delfe
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Sluce, which is neere unto Gorey, and most of the revolted Ships were within view neer to the other shoare, some great Guns were discharged on both sides, but little ex∣ecution done, then the Lord Admirall per∣ceiving that night began to approach, and like to be misty and dark, he gave Order to each Squadron to look diligently to their Guard, and the next morning, the CON∣STANT WAR VVICK desired a Parlee, which being granted, the Officers and those Sailors which were left in her, submitted and came in, desired to be indempnified for what was past; after her submitted the Hind, the Love, and the Satisfaction, the rest of those Ships sought sanctuary in the Harbour of Helver Sluce, and Prince Rupert useth his best skill to satisfie those that re∣main with him, and caused severall peeces of Ordinance to be drawne forth and plan∣ted on the shore: but whether that will be allowed on by the Dutch, we cannot yet know of any certainty; but some of them as∣sure us the contrary: it is rumoured, that the Prince is daily expected with them, yet, they
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>say, he is not so well recovered, as to come from the Hague, his Highnesse (we hear) is with the Lord Admirall, and thereby seek to make an agreement with the Parlia∣ment, and return again into England: but if any such thing be moved, let all men be assured that nothing will be acted that way, but what shall be with advice and approba∣tion of Parliament. The Duke of York is with Prince Rupert; if the Treaty doth not take effect, so as a peace be contented for all parties, it is thought the Prince will back a∣gaine into France.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Believe you have heard, (before this kisses your hands) that some of those ships which did adhere to the Prince, and deserted the Parliament, are gone in to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> but since those four which first submitted to him went away, two or three more have followed; amongst which is the <HI>Constantine,</HI> which bare the Prince his Colours, and the rest are blocked up in Helver-Sluce, so that it is believed that not one of them can escape, if they should doe their uttermost to obtaine it; but
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>to tell you the truth, of what we thinke, it is rather conceived, that they will follow the example of those which are already gone to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> then dispute the businesse any further; for the making Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Commander in chief of the Prince his Fleet in his absence, bred such a rankor in the hearts both of Seamen and others, that when he came and read his Commission to them, they stucke not to tell him, that they had rather sheath their swords in his bowels then be commanded by him, &amp; indeed when <HI>Batten</HI> &amp; <HI>Jorden</HI> (by reason of discontent) left his High∣ness, the greatest part of the Navy, there went off with them, or staggred in their affections, so that in all pro∣bability the Prince had not sooner gained this Fleet, and set up his Standard then it will be lost: For the Earle of <HI>Warwick</HI> doth not only keep in the remain∣ing part, so that they must in all likelyhood within a short time submit, but with the manning of those which are already come into him (whereof some car∣ry 40. peeces of Ordinance a peece) hath sent a gal∣lant Squadron of Ships to the Downes, to be a guard to Marchants and other Ships passing upon the nar∣row Seas.</P>
<P>The Prince is not so well recovered as to come from the Hague, and the Earle of <HI>Warwick</HI> hath sent another summons to the Ships which shelter them∣selves in Helver-Sluce, so that it is believed the hopes which some did entertain that there would by way of Treaty be an agreement between his Highnesse and the Earle of <HI>Warwick,</HI> wil. come to nothing</P>
