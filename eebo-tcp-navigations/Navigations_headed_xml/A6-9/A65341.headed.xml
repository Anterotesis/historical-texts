<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR COZEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Bristow</HI> touching here homewards bound, brought safe those Commodities I gave you the trouble to send me, and enricht me with the Treasure of your more welcome Letter; To which though I cannot Answer in the same handsome expres∣sions and Embroidery of Language (a failure easily excusable in a place where my Native Tongue is almost a stranger, and <HI>French</HI> generally spo∣ken more barbarous then that of <HI>Littleton</HI>) yet be confident I shall never when opportunity offers it self come short in the real offices of Good-will and Affection; I am glad some of our old Acquaintance are still so kind as to preserve me in their memories, And could not but call <HI>Ned</HI> and <HI>Jenny</HI> to help laugh at the pleasant Narration you make of the surprize many of them are in, when you tell them I have left <HI>South-hampton</HI> to go dwell in the Isle of <HI>SERKE;</HI> Some inquiring in which of the <HI>Indies</HI> that strange Island lies, others offering wagers there is no such place in the World, but that it is younger Sister to the Isle of <HI>Pines;</HI> Nor indeed can I condemn their wonder since although this place hath for about fourscore years paid obedience to the <HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Scepter, yet scarce one <HI>English-man</HI> of a thousand hath heard or can give any good Accompt of it; our Geographers have herein proved Land-Lopers, and the very Mapps wherein oftimes Painters gratifie their Wives with Joinctures of Imaginary Islands, have been content to omit the real one; However to satisfie the curiosity of my Friends, but more especially to comply with your desires (which I must ever interpret commands) I shall venture on a brief Description of this little part of the World where Providence hath alotted me a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, and (I thank Heaven) no uncomfortable Habitation;</P>
<P><HI>SERKE</HI> the place whence this Letter comes to Kiss your hands Is an Island scituate in the Channel betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> Lying at once in view of the Banks of <HI>Norm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndy,</HI> and of our Two other more e∣minent Islands of <HI>Jers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> and <HI>Guernsey,</HI> and about 4 Leagues to the South∣west of the latter; Though its Circuit or Extent can yeild no great Temptation to any Princes ambition to make himself Master of it, Its Dimensions being not above 5 miles in length, and about 2 miles in fredth where it is largest over, in other places not so much; Yet Nature, as if she had here stored up some extraordinary Treasure seems to have been very solicitous to render it Impregnable, Being on every side surrounded
<PB N="2" REF="4"/><!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->with vast Rocks and mighty Clifts, whose craggy Tops Braving the Clouds with their stupendious height, bid defiance to All that shall dream of forcing an entrance; Two only Ascents or passages there are into it; The first where all Goods and Commodities are received called <HI>La-Soguien</HI> where for a large space through a solid Rock there is a Cart-way cut by Art down to the Sea, with two strong Gates for its defence, wherein most of the Storage for Navigation, as Masts, Sails, Anchors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> belonging to the Island are kept, And two pieces of Ordinance above al∣ways ready planted to prevent any surprize; The other is <HI>La-Frickerce,</HI> where only Passangers can Land, climbing up a Rock by certain Steps or Stairs cut therein to a vast height, and somewhat dangerously; Nor is it possible there for above one person to come up at once.</P>
<P>This Description of its Scituation I perswade my self, Cozen puts you unto a little fit of longing to know by what means our Country-men came at first to make themselves Master of a place so naturally fortified; And truly in discovering that, we shall acquaint you with a stratagem excel∣ling most you shall meet with in the Greek and Roman Histories and e∣qualled by few of those in the Low Countrey Wars, or any more mo∣dern expeditions.</P>
<P>In the Reign of our matchless Maiden Queen, this Island being wholly possest by <HI>French</HI> (as most of the Inhabitants not only thereof but of <HI>Jer∣sey</HI> and <HI>Guerns<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> too, are to this day of that Nation) A Sea-Captain (whose name I at present remember not, though tis pitty it ever should be swallowed by oblivion) apprehending Its neighbour-hood if it continu∣ed in the <HI>French</HI> hands might one time or other portend no good to the Isles of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Guernsey</HI> the only remaining Trophies of our <HI>French Conquests;</HI> solicited the Queen to Commission him to reduce it to her o∣bedience, who having received former Information of it, told him the place was so small and the attempt so hazardous it would scarce be worth while, and that she feared the loss of Men about it would be more da∣mage, than its taking of Importance or advantage; For you must note at that time the passage down at <HI>La-Soguien</HI> was not made, nor did it appear half so Accessible as now it appears; But our subtle Captain replyed. If Her Majesty would but give him Command and necessaries he durst assure Her to settle the <HI>English</HI> colours there without the loss of a Man; The Queen seeing his confidence yeilded to his Importunity, who accompanied with a∣bout 100 resolved Men puts to Sea, and after some time crusing up and down comes and lies before this Island <HI>SERKE</HI> in quality of a Mer∣chant-man homewards bound; And making out his Boat with several taking
<PB N="3" REF="4"/><!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->Commodities the people suffered 3 or 4 of their Crew to Land, and traded with them with much Amity for a day or two. At last having insinuated into the good opinion of the credulous Islanders They told them having been a long Trading Voyage in the <HI>Streights</HI> their Master was some time since dead, but had engaged them not to expose his Corps into the Ocean to be devoured of the Fish, but to Interr it with Christian Burial in the next place where they should touch ground, and therefore they desired that Christian favour of them that they might lay him in their Church-yard, coming only some few of them on Shore without any Arms to perform the Ceremony; The unwary people consent, and our Captain with about 20 of his stourest Men with a Coffin and much seeming solemnity get a Shore; The Natives assisting them to get their <HI>Trojan</HI> Horse up the Precipice; but no sooner were they arrived at the Church, but clapping to the Doors as if they had some private devotions to celebrate at which the inhabitants might not be present, They break open their Coffin filled instead of a dead body with Instruments of Death, and instantly arming themselves slay that small <HI>French</HI> Guard that there offered resistance, and retiring to the Landing place secure that, get in more of their company, and in 5 hours time without the loss of one Man, made themselves Masters of the whole Island, which ever since that time has had the Honour to boast it self part of the Domini∣ons of the English Crown.</P>
<P>But since nothing is more necessary to the Life of Man, than those four Elements whereof He together with the rest of the Universe is originally composed. I shall in the next place observe how we are therewith ac∣comodated.</P>
<P>Our Air considering the narrowness of the place, and how 'tis encompassed with the Ocean Is much better then can be expected, our Heaven serene, and our Sky generally free from that nasty dish-clout of Fogs and Clouds which in your Marishes and City too are wont to mufflle up the Suns glo∣rious face, In brief tis so agreeable to nature, That although I know not one Physitian in the Island (and perhaps we live the longer for their absence) yet to meet here a hearty old man of fourscore is nothing rare or infrequent.</P>
<P>Our water I confess is sometimes not very ready, and yet we have in the Island no less than six very fine springs generally running, Whose water pu∣rified in its under-ground passage, and by being drawn so high through Na∣tures Limbeck, Bubbles up so free from any smack of Brackishness, that it may compare with your Lambs-Conduit, and for ought I know is no less miraculous for curing sore Eyes than <HI>Crowders</HI> Well.</P>
<P>Our Earth or Soil Is for the most part hot and sandy, yet fruitful enough
<PB N="4" REF="5"/><!-- PDF PAGE 113 -->to afford all necesseries to its Inhabitants, excellent for bearing all kind of Roots, As Parsneps, Carrots; Turneps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And very well stored with fruit-trees (for the most part planted of late by the good Husbandry of the people) Furnishing us with Syder not at all inferiour to your <HI>Herefordshire</HI> Redstreak, and to render it the more wholesome tis generally boyled with a little spice, which preserves it and gives it an incomparable Rellish; Corn we have of most sorts, but not in any extraordinary quantity; our pasture is but short yet exceeding sweet and therefore we have rare Mutton, but no great plenty of Beef, and Cows only enow to supply us with Milk and Butter, for our Cheese we have generally from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Our Fireing (to speak of the most aspiring Element last) Is for the most part Furzes and sometimes Turf, For we have but little wood, and no Tim∣ber at all growing throughout the whole Island; so that we are forced either to make shift with old Apple-tree for our Houses, or furnish our selves as well as we can with Deal.</P>
<P>For Belly-timber our 3 staple Commodities are Fish, Fowl and Rabbets. Of the first a little Industry will purchase us a hundred sorts, particularly a large Fish we call a Vrack-fish which we split, and nailing it to our Walls dry it in the Sun for part of our Winter provision; As also a large shel-fish taken plentifully at Low-tides called an Ormond that sticks to the Rocks, whence we beat them off with a Fosel or Iron hook; Tis much bigger then an Oyster, and like that good either fresh or pickled; but infinitely more pleasant to the Gusto, so that an epicure would think his pallat in Paradice if he might but always gormondize on such delitious <HI>Ambrosia,</HI> To borrow <HI>Aretines</HI> phrase upon his eating a Lamprey.</P>
<P>For Fowl your City cannot be better furnisht with Wood-cocks or Widgeons, besides the abundance of Duck, Mallard, Teal and other wild∣fowl, with Clift-Pidgeons with which at some seasons almost the whole Island is covered.</P>
<P>Of Conies we have every where exceeding plenty, and yet least we should want, nature has provided us a particular Warren, placing at a small distance in the Sea an Island of about half a mile every way over, which is inhabited by nothing else whether we commonly go a Ferreting and have thence such abundance that it has been confidently told me some Families here have made 15 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year only of their Skins; If all this rich fare will not content you, we have a most excellent Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tage made of Milk Ba∣con, Coleworts, Mackerel and Gooseberries boyled together all to pieces, which our Mode Is to eat, not with the ceremony of a spoon, but the more Courtly way of a great piece of bread furiously plying between your mouth and the Kettle.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/><!-- PDF PAGE 113 -->
<P>But least you should think we mind too much our Bellies take next a survey of our political Government first for our defence we have a Captain with about 40 Souldiers, who continually keep Guard, and are maintained by contribution of the Inhabitants; Then we have a Court of Judicature held every <HI>Tuesday</HI> where an honest Fisherman we call the Judge, Another (at present his Son) that is intituled Monsieur <HI>Le Provest,</HI> a Person that has the gift of writing, and learning enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o read the Obligation of a Bond, serving as Clerk or Recorder, with 5 other sage Burgers that are Justices or some of them meet, and without any tedious formalities, Intricate De∣murrers, special Verdicts, wiredrawn Arguments, chargable Injunctions, multiplyed Motions, or endless Writs of Error, briskly determine all cau∣ses <HI>Secundum Aequum &amp; bonum</HI> according to their Mother-wit and grave discretions except in Criminals where Life is concerned, in which case the offenders are immediately sent away for tryal and punishment to <HI>Guernsey.</HI></P>
<P>Since the taking the place by the <HI>English</HI> Hugenote Ministers officiating, the people have subscribed to the Discipline which beyond the Seas They call Reformed, But wanting much of that beauty and decent order where∣with the Church of <HI>England</HI> entertains her Children, The present Minister (whom I must acknowledge a person of more Industry and parts than could be hoped for among such people) hath lately begun Teach Grammar to the Children with Writing and Arithmetick, erecting a School for that pur∣pose, so that who knows to that prodigious Learning we may here one day arrive? Sure I am, the genius of the people cannot but be docible, since they are naturally of a courteous affable temper, and the least tainted with Pride that ever I saw any any of their Nation; That apish variety of fan∣tastick fashions wherewith <HI>Paris</HI> is justly accused to infect all <HI>Europe,</HI> has here no footing; where every one retains the same garb their Ancestors wore in the days of <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> and King <HI>Pippin,</HI> so that I can give small encouragement to any of the Knights of the Thimble to transport them∣selves hither, where Cucumbers are like to be more plenty than in the back∣side of St. <HI>Clements;</HI> Each man religiously preserving his vast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew Trunk Breeches with a Cod-peice larger than King <HI>Harry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and a Coat almost like a Dutch Froes Vest, or one of your Watermens Liveries; Nor are the Women behind hand with them in their Hospital gowns of the same colour Wooden sandalls, white Stockings, and Red Petticoats so mean they are scarce worth taking up; Both Sexes on Festivals were large Ruffs and the Women instead of Hats or Hoods Truss up there hair, The more Gentile sort in a kind of Cabbidge-net, those of meaner Fortunes in a peice of Lin∣nen perhaps an old dish-clout turn'd out of service, or the fagg end of a
<PB N="6" REF="6"/><!-- PDF PAGE 114 -->Table-cloath that has escaped the persecution of washing ever since the Re∣formation; This they tying on the Top make it shew like a Turkish Tur∣bant, but that part of it hangs down their backs like a Veil, which might be of use to our wanton youngsters when the Spirit moves them to a kis∣sing exercise, but that we are never in such case put to use violence. For though our Females for proportion and complection are perfect <HI>French,</HI> and may for the most part without any usurpation assume <HI>Don Quixots</HI> Title of, Damsells of the ill favoured Face, yet to compensate that (and tis much this Sex should know their own defects) they are the most kind and obliging in the World, so sprightly, frollick, and gay-humourd that I am confident <HI>Mahomet</HI> can no where pick up more buxome Girls to stock his Paradise with.</P>
<P>But tis more then time to release your patience, save that I perswade my self you have not had enough to read half thus far, let me conclude with a word or two of our Trade, which I confess is not very great to the <HI>Levant</HI> or either of the <HI>Indies, Bristol</HI> and some other of your <HI>Western</HI> Ports being the furthest places of our traffick: for the grand and almost only Manufacture of our Island being knitting, which our People perform with a wonderfull dexterity both for Stockings, Gloves, Caps and Waste-coats, Men Women and Children being brought up to it: so that you may commonly see 30 or 40 of them assembled in a Barn, which you would take for a Conventicle of your sweet singers of <HI>Israel.</HI> for though all ply their knitting devoutly, yet at the same time they tune their pipes: and torture some old song with more distracted notes, than a Country Quire does one of <HI>Hopkins</HI> his Psalmes; these commodityes when finished we vend into <HI>England</HI> at the places aforesaid, having several small vessels for that purpose, and thence in return furnish our selves with necessaries.</P>
<P>I doubt not but by this time you repent your curiosity and confess that I have sufficiently tormented you with the Isle of <HI>SERKE,</HI> nor know I any way to receive your good opinion, which I am more than confident my tediousness has forfeited, but by begging your pardon and drinking your health in a black Jack of French Wine, which paying no custome we have here as plentifully cheap as in <HI>Faance</HI> it self; I hope you will pledg me at the Bear, where if the old <HI>Bacchus</HI> be still living commend me to him, assure all my friends that I shall return their loves with usery, speak my respects particularly to <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>D.</HI> Cap. <HI>S.</HI> and to your self take me as I am,</P>
