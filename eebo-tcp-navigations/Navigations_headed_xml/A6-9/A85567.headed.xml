<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N Sunday Morning last, being the 15 of this present <HI>August,</HI> Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> set saile to Sea.</P>
<P>Yesterday being Monday the 16 of <HI>August,</HI> he discovered the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and about one of the clock that day he met with a fleet of theirs, consisting of 60 saile of men of war, and 25 Merchants men.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Ayscues</HI> fleet consisted of 41 with
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>which he charged the Hollanders whole fleet and made a stout fight.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Geor. Ayscue</HI> charged them quite through, And not being able to go to the windward of all, received 40 broad sides, and after goe away. Then Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> charged them againe, and made another furious assault.</P>
<P>It is supposed that we have sunke their Rear Admirall; they (if not) will have much adoe to save her.</P>
<P>The fight was extream hot, but no board∣ing either of other. We suppose the Hollan∣ders loss must needs be very great, for they were extreamly torne with our bullets, and we have great losse also.</P>
<P>Capt Lisle, a precious sweet commander, is sore wounded and almost dead. Cap Pack that excellent stout Sea-man, hath his leg shot off. Night approaching the fight ceased, and in the night both the fleets lay still, ha∣ving both of them their lights out.</P>
<P>On this morning being the 17 instant, we discovered the Enemy about 4 leagues off.</P>
<P>Hereupon a Councell of War was to con∣sult what to doe, in further proceedings a∣gainst
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>the enemy, and it was unanimously resolved by the Councel of war to ingage them againe. Hereupon preparation was made, our fleet presently sailed, and stood up towards them.</P>
<P>About 12 a clock this present Tuesday, 17 August it is beleeved there might be an ingagement.</P>
<P>The Lord direct them and stand by them, to deliver and support our friends, and I doubt not but the Lord will perfect that work he hath thus far hitherto triumphant∣ly carried on.</P>
<P>Our men called upon God before they ingaged, the Dutch drunk soundly to make them fight, strong drink was given to their men as their custome is, to raise up a courage in them to fight the most desperately.</P>
<P>The East India Fleete with those other ships stay until these combustions be a little over, or that they can have a sure convoy, for without doubt the mouthes of the Dutch water at them. I beleeve by the next you will heare of a greater ingagement then this.</P>

<HEAD>Another Letter from <HI>Plimouth.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPon discovery of the Dutch Fleet yesterday about one a clocke, a Councell of War was presently called, and it was resolved to fight them presently if they would stand, and accordingly, Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> sailed and put up towards them.</P>
<P>About <HI>4</HI> a clock last night, Sir <HI>George Ays∣cue</HI> came up close to them and engaged, and the fight was very hot. Our men fought all stoutly, as ever was knowne, we had losse of some precious men, but without doubt the Dutch sustained a ve∣ry considerable losse. The fight continued about <HI>4</HI> houres, so that about <HI>8</HI> a clock it growing dark, they were forced to leave off.</P>
<P>The <HI>George</HI> and the <HI>Bonaventure</HI> being much shattered, and ready to sinke came in hither, and are mending.</P>
<P>Cap. <HI>Packs</HI> Legge is shot off in the fight, and Cap. <HI>Lisle</HI> hath a wound in his shoulder, that wee fear will prove mortall.</P>
<P>The Admirall and the rest fought with great valour and gallantry, but wee have sustained loss,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>though I beleeve not so much as the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The Admirall lost in her <HI>12</HI> men in this fight and received <HI>60</HI> shot in her Hull, And so divers others have received losse, and wee have many wounded men.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> kept as much as he could in ken of them all night, and is resolved, if possi∣ble, to engage them this day.</P>
<P>And accordingly <HI>500</HI> men, big with courage and stoutnesse, are gone in small ships to recruit our fleet with men. And so they are gone towards the Enemy.</P>
<P>It being now about noon is the time wee expect about which they may bee engaged.</P>
<P>The number of the Dutch that engaged yester∣day with Sir <HI>George Ayscue,</HI> were <HI>55</HI> men of Warre, we were but <HI>41.</HI></P>
<P>Our Admirall, Vice Admirall and Rear Admirall, with about five or six others, broke through their whole fleet, so as the <HI>25</HI> Merchants men ran away to the coasts of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>What the event of this day will bee the Lord a∣lone knows, but our trust is in the Lord of Hoasts, whom we hope is with us.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P> <HI>But the next opportunity, I shal (which I beleeve will be within few houres) certifie you what I shal further heare of the successe or event.</HI></P>
