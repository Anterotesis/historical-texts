<HEAD>Reasons delivered by the Committee of Ci∣tizens, Adventurers in <HI>London</HI> for Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to the Committee appointed by the Right Honourable the Lord Major, Aldermen and Common Councell of the said City, to be delivered to the said Court, of their refusall to lend Monies upon security of the Ordinance of the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August</HI> last, made for raising Mo∣nies for <HI>Ireland,</HI> to begin in <HI>November</HI> next, and to continue for six Moneths.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Adventurers, with their Monies raised upon their first Pro∣positions, were to have carried over a Brigade of 500 Horse, and 5000 Foot, into <HI>Munster</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> against those Re∣bels; which businesse they were to have carried on by Officers chosen by themselves, whereby they had the oversight of that businesse, and laying out of their own Money, for the best advantage of the Service.</P>
<P>When they had well nigh raised and armed all their Forces, and made all other Provisions fit for transportation, both their Money, and Men, and Pro∣visions, were (upon an unavoidable occasion) made use of by the State here, upon a suddain and unexpected breaking forth of the distractions here at home, and the remain of what was not thus imployed, or that hath come into their Treasuries since, have likewise been made use of by the State here, wherewith to content the <HI>Irish</HI> Officers, who have done very little or no ser∣vice for all the Money that they had since.</P>
<P>These distractions increasing, and thereupon when those Lords and Com∣mons that were appointed by Commission, under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> by direction both of King and Parliament, to manage the <HI>Irish</HI> affairs, had withdrawn themselves from further medling in the businesse; and when after that, a Committe of the Honourable House of Commons, made by order of the third of <HI>September,</HI> 1642. for ordering of the <HI>Irish</HI> affairs, had acted therein so long, as that they had left no Cash in any <HI>Irish</HI> Treasury to answer their Orders; and that a generall clamour of the <HI>Irish</HI> Souldiary was now upon them for pay and supplies, which they could not remedy; and a hard matter it was, by reason of the use of Monies here, to finde out a means to give
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> them satisfaction; when <HI>Bristol, Chester,</HI> and most of th' other parts of the West, were possessed by the Enemy, whereby all conveniencies for sending for <HI>Ireland</HI> were taken away, then the Adventurers in <HI>London,</HI> made more Propositions to raise more Money from among themselves, without Tax or Assessement of the Subject, to carry on that Warre.</P>
<P>That thereupon an Ordinance was made, establishing those new Proposi∣tions, and to secure all such as should adventure any Money thereupon, and erecting and setling of a new Committee, consisting of some of the Members of the Honourable House of Commons, and of diverse Aldermen and Mer∣chants of <HI>London,</HI> Adventurers for Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> chosen out by the Body of Adventurers to manage the <HI>Irish</HI> affairs.</P>
<P>And they were no sooner made a Committee, but the Citizens of the Committee, are perswaded to advance 10000<SUP>lb</SUP> or thereabouts worth of Arms, Ammunition and victuals, wherewith to furnish 500 Horse, and 5000 Foot, of the <HI>British</HI> Regiments in <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> upon promise, that they should, being thus furnished, march out of that Province against the Rebels, into other parts of the Kingdom, having no enemy near themselves; which Goods were presently provided and delivered accordingly, yet they never did service therewith, nor at any time since, that the Committee can understand.</P>
<P>That by the labour and industry of the Citizens of that Committee, they have procured 30000<SUP>lb</SUP> worth of Provisions more to be sent to the Forces there, out of <HI>Holland</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> which if they had not recei∣ved, they had disbanded and quit the Countrey to the Enemy, or must have complied in the Cessation with the Rebels, (which had been as bad) as some of the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficers confessed.</P>
<P>The said Committee of the Citizens also, in this time have sent 5000<SUP>lb</SUP> worth more of Provisions thither, which were bought with the Adventurers Money.</P>
<P>Yet they are now left in debt 5000<SUP>lb</SUP> or thereabout, for part of those Provisions thus advanced, and without means to give those satisfaction to whom they stand engaged; Which have been thus occasioned.</P>
<P>For that it hath been publikely delivered to the Adventurers, at a generall meeting of them, as if the Parliament intend not to performe in that Or∣dinance with those that have or should bring in Money for an Adventure up∣on it; since which time, very little or nothing hath been brought into their Treasury; and those that had subscribed upon that Ordinance, do refuse to bring in their Subscriptions.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Irish</HI> affairs have been since carried on, for a good time together, by the Committe of the Honourable House of Commons, of the third of
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> <HI>September,</HI> 1642. and afterwards by the Honourable Committee of both Kingdoms, and now by the Honourable Committee of Lords and Com∣mons for Propositions for <HI>Ireland,</HI> which have cooled and withdrawn the zeal and affections of the Adventurers and others, to bring in any more Mo∣ney upon the said Ordinance of the 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>July,</HI> 1643. seeing their Com∣mittee set aside, and to have no oversight or looking unto the managing of that businesse, and the disposall of their Monies; (that great summe of 300000<SUP>lb</SUP> or thereabouts,) which they have formerly brought in, having been imployed as aforesaid, without adding to them the least hope to possesse their Adventures.</P>
<P>They have been imployed since, as a Subcommittee to the Honourable Committee of both Kingdoms; in which service they have faithfully per∣formed their trust, and have informed their Lordships of all those miscar∣riages and failings of the Officers in the Armies in <HI>Ireland,</HI> then under the Parliaments power, and otherwise concerning those affairs; and how the States Treasure have been wasted and consumed, and nothing done for it; with their opinions of the remedies to prevent the like misdoings for the time to come, which they having done in the birth of their imployments under their Lordships, have not lately received more of their commands, (ex∣cept in raising of Monies for the Service) to which they have alwayes con∣tributed to their powers, when they have found certain wayes of reim∣bursement.</P>
<P>In this time they have offered their endeavours freely, in making provi∣sions for those Forces, out of the Monies raised and to be raised upon that Or∣dinance of the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. if to have been imployed in a Com∣mittee way upon accompt; but the Officers of the Army in <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> and one M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Davis</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> man, and some Cheesemongers of this City, joyning with them under hand, obtained the imployments, upon Contracts and bargains made, to deliver those Provisions at certain rates; when the Committee, if to have done the same in a Committee way, would have advanced the same much sooner, and have saved the State 12000<SUP>lb</SUP>, or 15000<SUP>lb</SUP>, in 60000<SUP>lb</SUP> of the prices allowed <HI>Davis;</HI> and though they alwayes declined to do any thing in a way of bargaining, yet when it was pressed of necessity to be done no other way, they offered the State to do it by computation, 7000<SUP>lb</SUP> or thereabouts, in the said 60000<SUP>lb</SUP>, under those rates that <HI>Davis</HI> offered; which not being so apprehended, he hath been the Man hath carried on all that bu∣sinesse before him ever since; but by his leave hath failed in all his underta∣kings, both for time, manner and matter; for albeit his agreement was, for to have delivered the Goods by 10000<SUP>lb</SUP> the first week, and 5000<SUP>lb</SUP> worth
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> of Goods every week after, till the whole had been delivered, yet it was four or five moneths time before he delivered any parcell, and but very lately that he delivered the last; and hath vented such base and unserviceable Commo∣dities, as they were little worth: besides that, he and his partners did runne no hazard in it at all, for he only assigned the Monies to come in, in severall Counties to his respective Chapmen, for payment at long dayes, who took the same for satisfaction upon their own Adventures, and reserved a good share and benefit to himself; and then no doubt but they would also be Gain∣ers by the hand, thus to trust; which must bring poor Commodities to the Market of necessity, or make his Customers but Savers by the hand; and this beginning hath brought him to be the generall undertaker and provider for whatsoever Goods have gone for the Forces of <HI>Ireland</HI> since; but in this latter bargains, he hath dealt much more securely for himself, having still fingered so much Money in hand, upon the matter, as he hath acquired the Goods with∣all, that if he should never get in the rest, he can be no Loser by the hand, and an extream Gainer if to receive all, and hath made provision to be satisfied some other way, if he get it not by this way; besides that, he hath taken such wayes for the delivery of the Commodities, and made such provisions for the Collections of the Monies, that he will be sure either to have it in before he shall lay it out, with a 1000<SUP>lb</SUP>, and 6<SUP>d</SUP> in the pound too for his pains in the collecting it, or if he fails, another Countrey is as good to him as this: besides that, he hath hemmed in to be paid out of these Assessements for <HI>Ireland,</HI> an old pretended Debt of 12195<SUP>lb</SUP>, which is upon matter of Accompt, depend∣ing before the Committee of Accompts for the Kingdoms, not yet by them allowed, and which if it shall be satisfied him, is a fortune that he hath raised in little more then Nine moneths time, by the States imployments in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> there trusting him with 4000<SUP>lb</SUP> ready Money to buy the Souldiers Vi∣ctuals, having no ability of his own before that time, wherewith to carry on such an Imployment; and the best of his Vouchers will prove Certificates in grosse from the said Colonels and Officers of that Army, for which no doubt but the common Souldiers have either made many hungry meals, or abated it out of their Commanders rents, they being most their Tennants; and there∣fore unwilling to go further abroad to do service, then they can bewray the smoak of their own chimnies; and yet such a Stranger as this <HI>Davis,</HI> is able thus in lesse then a years time, to furnish 160000<SUP>lb</SUP> worth of Commodities for <HI>Ireland,</HI> before the Committee of Adventurers, consisting of One and thirty Aldermen and good Merchants of this City, who desire to have no such gain from the Common wealth in such distracted and necessitous times as these.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>The Committee of Adventurers at Grocers-Hall (out of their zeal for the Publike, and care for the preservation of that Kingdom, being so neerly con∣cerned with this, as that the wellfare of either is wrapt up together in the sa∣fety and preservation of them both, more then for any benefit they expect by their Adventures) the 27<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August,</HI> 1644. did present severall Propositions to the Honourable House of Commons, for raising Monies principally from among themselves, wherewith to maintain those Forces against the Cessa∣tion and the Rebels, and the same day a draught of that Ordinance (passed the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. was also presented to the Honourable House of Commons, by the Committee of that Honourable House, sitting by Order of the 3<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>September,</HI> 1642. aforesaid, and both were Committed together: but the Committee of Grocers-Hall as yet, (by reason of the more weighty affairs of the Kingdom,) have received no answer concerning them; they have also diverse times since renewed their humble desires therein, by severall Petitions and Remonstrances, presented both to the Honourable Houses, and the Honourable Committee of both Kingdoms, for their mediation that some∣thing might be done therein, but other the great affairs of the State, hath still prevented the consideration thereof: they have lately also addressed them∣selves therein to the Honourable Committee of Lords and Commons, ap∣pointed for receiving of Propositions for <HI>Ireland,</HI> with whom they debated the same, and after consultation thereof amongst themselves, of the results of both Committees, their Lordships transmitted back again unto them the heads of such of their Propositions, as they thought fit for the Considera∣tion of the Houses, desiring that the body of Adventurers might be called together, to advise with the Committee thereupon, and to certifie them what Moneys they would advance, and what other encouragements they would give, to move the Houses to incline to passe them: and thereupon the Adventurers did meet accordingly, and upon debate thereof amongst them∣selves, did returne the same back again to the said Honourable Committee of Lords and Commons for Propositions for <HI>Ireland,</HI> with some small altera∣tions; and withall did returne unto their Lordships the humble Petition of the Committee and Body of the most principall Adventurers of the City, signed with many of their hands; offering upon the credit of such an Ordi∣nance to passe presently, to have advanced 20000<SUP>lb</SUP> in Money, and such Pro∣visions as should be ordered to be sent for relief of those Forces, and that they did not doubt but thereby to make all further supplies for carrying on that Warre in <HI>Munster,</HI> and that those Forces being well supplied and maintain∣ed (under God) might be a great and ready means, quickly to reduce all that Kingdom under the power of the Parliament; and praying their
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> Lordships to recommend that their Petition, with the said Propositions to the Honourable Houses to be considered accordingly; but all this notwith∣standing, the Adventurers cannot understand that the same have been deli∣vered to the Houses accordingly.</P>
<P>But now since the Right Honourable the Lord Major, have heretofore been desired to summon a meeting of all the Adventurers, and that it might be propounded unto them to lend 15000<SUP>lb</SUP>, or more Money upon the Credit of this other Ordinance lately passed, for raising Monies for <HI>Ireland,</HI> by an∣other Assessement for six Moneths more, to begin in <HI>November</HI> next; at which meeting some of that Honourable Committee were present, and upon debate thereof it was not thought fit to be done; and indeed both the Com∣mittee and Body of Adventurers having formerly been treated with to that purpose, both before and since the passing of that Ordinance, did give their opinions, that if it should passe, as things then stood, and yet do stand, it could hardly be expected that Monies would be advanced upon it, for diverse rea∣sons then given; and since the passing it, Commissioners of the Citizens are named, without the privity of the Adventurers, to go for <HI>Munster</HI> in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> to act for the City there, which never had, nor hath any particular en∣gagement in that part of the Kingdom, the Adventurers hoping they shall have their own Choice, of such as they shall employ there, concerning their Adventures.</P>
<P>And the Reasons that moved the Committee of Grocers-Hall heretofore, and yet doth, to refuse the lending of any Money, upon this Ordinance of the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August,</HI> 1645. were, and are these following. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>First, The said Ordinance doth revive a former Ordinance of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. and the Committee have never yet seen or understood of any such Ordinance made, but of an Ordinance made the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. to which this Ordinance hath no relation; and if there be no such Ordinance of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. then this Ordinance of the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August,</HI> 1645. hath lost its effect, and cannot revive that which never had a being.</P>
<P>Secondly, To revive an Ordinance to have continuance for a longer time, after its expiration, without more words to expresse the intent and power thereof, to make new Levies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may admit of a dispute, what is meant by this word (Reviving) standing thus alone, and may well be construed only to intend the Levying of such Monies thereupon, as have not been colle∣cted within the time of its being and continuance, and in such a Case is no foundation of Credit, to engage for borrowing of Money.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Admitting these exceptions were out of doors, (yet then there is a proviso, that all Arrearages which shall be due and unlevied for the
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> Weekly assessements upon the said Ordinance of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. (if any such be) for the time of Continuance first limited therein, the same shall be leavied, brought in and paid to the Treasurers according to the Ordi∣nance, and that the same shall be disposed and issued out for the discharge of the Orders and Contracts made with the Houses of Parliament, or the Committee of the two Kingdoms, in pursuance of the said Ordinance; which shews, that the word, Reviving, in the Ordinance of the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August,</HI> 1645. is meant of Leavying what is behinde and unpaid of that Ordinance at the time of its expiration, and mentions nothing of any new Leavy or Assessement to be made, and so is conceived no such security to borrow Money upon as is propounded.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The Ordinance of the 16<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October,</HI> 1644. made for an As∣sessement thorow the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> for the present Relief of the <HI>British</HI> Armies in <HI>Ireland,</HI> should raise above 200000<SUP>lb</SUP> in all places; and that there is 80000<SUP>lb</SUP> charged upon it, first for relieving the <HI>Brittish</HI> Regiments in <HI>Ʋlster;</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Davis</HI> hath ob∣tained another reviving Ordinance of it, of the 27<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>September,</HI> 1645. to satisfie him the summe of 36945<SUP>lb</SUP> more, so it is charged with 116945<SUP>lb</SUP> in all; of this, 50000<SUP>lb</SUP> is only yet come into the Treasury, that there is 66945<SUP>lb</SUP> yet to be leavied, and this must be leavied the first; and who will lend Money, to expect it after the leavying and payment of such a Summe, and to put it to a hazard; whenas a man may lend out his Money, and have 8<SUP>lb</SUP> <HI>per cent.</HI> for it, to be repaid in his own time, and to have as good security as the Kingdom can afford?</P>
<P>Fifthly, If only 50000<SUP>lb</SUP> of 200000<SUP>lb</SUP> have been brought in, in a years time, and at the first beginning, when men were better able and disposed to the worke, and this done by the earnest and continuall sollicitation of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Da∣vis,</HI> and of his Emissaries and Creditours that are so concerned in it, and have acted it to the life; what can be conceived must follow of these Assesse∣ments in the later end of the day, when men are more and more exhausted in their estates, and who now do fall short to satisfie those Assessements (in as great a proportion) of maintenance of Generall <HI>Fairfax</HI> Army, and of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army in <HI>England,</HI> which are for their immediate and more neces∣sary preservation, and the subduing of an Enemy here at home?</P>
<P>Sixtly, The people begin generally to understand the ill carriage of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Da∣vis,</HI> and his fellow Cheesmongers in this businesse, and that they hunt af∣ter these bargains, to raise themselves fortunes this way, and care not how they deceive the Common wealth, so they may enrich themselves, and put the Money into their own purses; which not only makes the people unwil∣ling,
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> but many of them wilfull to refuse the payment of these Monies, which many of them do apprehend thus may be cast away; and are not a little troubled, to see the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> men of worth and integrity, un∣imployed in the service; and such a poor fellow as <HI>Davis,</HI> and a meer stran∣ger, vaulting himself herein against the whole City. For these Reasons, the Committee of Adventurers at Grocers-Hall, as heretofore, so do now again desire to be excused for lending of any Monies upon the Tearmes propound∣ed, which they desire may be delivered to the Right Honourable the Lord Major, Aldermen and Common-Councell, as their sense and answer to their demands.</P>
<P>And now albeit they are not desirous to draw imployment, and the bur∣then of more businesse upon themselves, yet for the good and benefit of the Common-wealth, and the better safety and preservation of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> so nearly concerned with this; if the Houses of Parliament might be moved yet to consider of their Propositions, and to passe them into an Ordinance, in such way as they shall thinke fit, that so a ground and sure foundation may be laid, not only to relieve those Forces in <HI>Munster</HI> for the present, but to maintain and carry on that Warre there. Upon the Credit of such an Ordinance, they shall yet be willing to advance the 20000<SUP>lb</SUP> so formerly undertaken, and carefully to provide for continuall supplies to be made for the future; and will freely bestow their greatest care and in∣dustry, to husband things for the best benefit and advantage of the Ser∣vice, without expectation of benefit or reward; and doubt not but in such case (under God) to render the Parliament a good Accompt of that Pro∣vince in a short time; which is especially considerable (as the State of the affairs of that Kingdom now stands at present) that it be secured of all the rest, both against the Rebels within it self, and the Enemy that may invade it suddainly from abroad.</P>
<P>They have likewise hereunto annexed the Copies of those heads of their said Propositions and of their Petition, the Originals remaining with the said Committee of Lords and Commons, which were, as they conceive, once heretofore agreed upon by the said Committe and body of Adventurers, to have been presented to the Honourable Houses of Parliament for their consideration: and it is the humble suit of this Committee, that the Right Honourable the Lord Major, Aldermen and Common-Councell, would yet be pleased, if they shall so thinke fit, to interpose their mediation to the Ho∣nourable Houses of Parliament, that the same may be considered accordingly, and in such way as they shall thinke fit.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE Honourable House of Commons in this present Parliament assembled, The Humble Petition of the Committee and Body of Adventurers in <HI>London</HI> for Lands in <HI>Ireland</HI> sitting at Grocers-Hall.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Shewing,</OPENER>
<P>THat ever since the Parliament, by their Ordinance of the 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>July,</HI> 1643. was pleased to make them a Committee to act in the <HI>Irish</HI> affairs, they have imployed the utmost of their endeavours to serve the Common-wealth in that businesse, and are ready to give an Accompt of their Actions therein, which they are well assured, upon ex∣amination, will render them free and clear from all neglect of duty and service in whatsoever they have been trusted.</P>
<P>But it hath been their unhappinesse in this time, for want of further power and trust, that they have not been so serviceable as they desired, and as other∣wise they could have been.</P>
<P>And many moneths since, they humbly presented to this Honourable As∣sembly their Petition, together with certain Propositions for raising Monies for the better carrying on of that Warre, and whereof severall times since th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y have been, by their other Remonstrances and supplications, besought the consideration, which by the interposition of more weighty affairs have till this time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven by.</P>
<P>And now lately they have again addressed themselves herein unto the Ho∣nourable Committee of Lord and Commons, for receiving and preparing of Propositions for the Honourable Houses for this Service, and who upon the
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> debate hereof have been pleased to approve of so much thereof, as your Peti∣tioners do humbly conceive they have already, or do shortly intend to present to this Honourable Assembly to be considered.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners do apprehend the Province of <HI>Munster</HI> in that Realm, and consequently that Kingdom, is now at present in great danger to be lost, without timely supplies, and provisions to be made for to maintain those Forces for the future.</P>
<P>And they further crave leave, humbly to present their sense and opinions of this present affair (alwayes with submission to your graver judgements) that if these Propositions shall be thought fit to be framed into an Ordinance, to passe both the Honourable Houses of Parliament; then your Petitioners, upon the credit thereof, will advance 20000<SUP>lb</SUP> in Money, and Provisions for the Service, and in such reasonable time as the exegencie of the occasion, and this Honourable House shall r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quire the same.</P>
<P>And are confident from time to time, to make all such further supplies for maintenance of the Forces there in that Province, by this means, as will not only render the same wholly under your power, but probably (under God) may be a great occasion to reduce those Rebels to their obedience, and subject all that Realm under the Parliaments command.</P>
<P>All the Adventurers also, and others with them alike concerned in that Kingdom, will thus undoubtedly be abundantly satisfied and encouraged, with ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erfullnesse to contribute and lay out themselves yet more in this af∣fair; and the Parliament will be freed from much trouble and care other∣wise for to make provisions for that service for the future and time to come.</P>
<P>The lives of many thousands of poor Protestants, our friends and brethren, will thus be there preserved, and this Kingdom delivered from a bloud-thirsty Enemy, which otherwise will daily infest us here at home, both by sea and land.</P>
<P>The honour of this Nation will be thus still preserved, in maintaining our interests there, which our Ancestours heretofore have purchased, and for many hundreds of years maintained, with the expence of much Treasure and bloud.</P>
<P>The Parliament and its party will be hereby exceedingly strengthened, and their Adversaries extreamly weakned, both in their present hopes, power and assistance, both there and from abroad.</P>
<P>The Protestant party thorowout Christendome, will the rather also be en∣couraged to joyn with us in this great worke of Reformation, and a fruit∣full and good Land will thus again ere long be repeopled, to live under the Sunshine of the Gospel, where otherwise Popery and superstition will be planted, to the great dishonour of Almighty God, and the great discomfort of the Nation to succeeding generations.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
<P>Your Petitioners will thus also save very much to the State, both in the prices and goodnesses of such provisions as shall be necessarily sent for that Service, and will do the same in time as readily, and much more satisfacto∣rily to the people, then any particular men shall possibly be able to undertake and do; All which they humbly pray this Honourable Assembly to consider accordingly.</P>

<HEAD>Reasons delivered by the Adventurers in <HI>London</HI> for Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for to maintain the Equity of their Propositions, Presented to the Honourable Houses of PARLIAMENT, for the better carrying on the Warre in <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THey did propound them, almost two years since, in more perillous times, when that Kingdom was even gasping for life, and in Cessa∣tion with the Rebels, all the parts of it but <HI>Ʋlster;</HI> and when this Kingdom was in a very sad and calamitous condition, in great dan∣ger to have been destroyed by a potent enemy, and with much labour work∣ing out supplies for the support of it self at home, and which they have pur∣sued ever since, with many more then twenty Petitions and Remonstrances to the Parliament and their Committees, to have gained consideration, which the great affairs of this Kingdom hath still prevented, till this time; the said Committee of Grocers-Hall having procured much relief in the in∣terim to the Souldiers in <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> which hath kept them together, and since to the Souldiers in <HI>Munster,</HI> that they have declared themselves for the Parliament; or otherwise they have confessed, that whole Kingdome was in great danger to have been yeelded up and lost; which proves the reality of the Committees affections, and that their labours have not been fruitlesse, nor
<PB N="19" REF="13"/> to have been byassed to any other ends, then the meer good of the Kingdoms.</P>
<P>There is not any of the said Propositions, which doth generally charge the people by Tax or Assessement, but are all in effect arbitrary and of benevo∣lence, a matter considerable, to ease the Subject what possible may be in these times, when their estates are so much weakened and exhaust, as that they are very hardly able to pay such Taxes and Contributions as are charged upon them, meerly necessary for to support the burthens of the Common-wealth at home, saving that one only Proposition which is desired to com∣pell the ill affected, that have obscured and estranged themselves all this while from assisting the Parliament and this Cause, with their purses and persons, having done very little, or not in proportion to their estates as o∣thers, and whose greatest injury in this constraint, will be but to compell them unto an act for their own advantage; and that they now joyne with the good party, to carry on the Warre there, in a time more neerer to the be∣nefit to be received for their disbursements, and wherein they shall, with more visible hopes, partake of that which hath been all this time preserved to such a day of good expectation, by those that have made conscience to save their Countrey from ruin, with the expence and hazard of their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>They are all Propositions tending to the maintenance of that Warre, the more speedy reducing of those Rebels to their obedience, the reestablishment of that Government once again in peace and quiet, and the better peopling and civilizing of that Realm, for which all should possibly contend, and lay down those ways and means that have the greatest likelihood and appearance to effect a good and speedy plantation of that Kingdom, with a religious people, in the place and stead of that Idolatrous Nation the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels.</P>
<P>For which purpose, if there may be raised a considerable revenue to the Crown, to support its own burthen, though with some assistance and helpe from hence now in the beginning; if such wayes and courses may be taken, as may the soonest bring all the three Kingdoms, all to be as one Nation and people, and may the speediest secure it from danger of an enemy, is with∣out all peradventure of the greatest consideration.</P>
<P>Which to effect and bring to passe, is by engaging all the three Kingdoms together by all possible wayes and means, and all the Protestant party in Christendome in one common bond and union, that will submit to our forme of government in Church, and the Civil State; and if the Parliament should give those Lands freely to men thus qualified and undertaking (alwayes re∣serving such a good revenue to the Crown thereout, as aforesaid) must que∣stionlesse do this with the most speed and security.</P>

<P>How can it be then reasonably objected, against those that have and shall not only adventure considerable summes of Money, to carry o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e there at present, but agree to secure great rents unto the Crown for their Lands for the future, to have whatsoever proportions of the Rebels estate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they shall upon such tearms acquire and undertake to plant?</P>
<P>Upon which grounds, will it not be very advantagious to the Common-wealth, if to condescend to all such Propositions as shall thus do this wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: As first, that the Adventurer, that brings in ready Money, have the priority to be satisfied; next, that the Souldier may be allowed all, or part of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pay, and entertainment out of these Rebels Lands at least; and next, those P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣testants of other Nations, that will Adventure and set down with us upon these conditions, that those poor Protestants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who have been di∣spoiled of their estates there by the Rebels, and many thousands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their lives, their heirs and assignes have not only restitution of what have been thus forcibly taken from them, but satisfaction for such damages also as they have sustained, out of the estates of those Rebels by whom they have thus suf∣fered, which would cause thousands to returne, that otherwise will not; and if those Merchants of <HI>London</HI> and else-where, that have lost their debts by the Rebellion there, paying some Money more at present, may have a share also of the Rebels Lands for all: And if those Counties, Cities and Towns Corporate, which shall pay any Monies towards the support of this Warre, hereafter may have proportions of Lands also assigned unto them for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole Monies they shall disburse, the revenew thereof to be for maintenance of their common Charges, would not this, in all likelihood, suddenly plant the place, and make it become a flourishing Common-wealth?</P>
<P>Besides that, by these means that Kingdom will be thus furnished with Free-holders for to put the Laws in execution, and for bringing of those Re∣bels unto condigne punishment, of which otherwise there will for a long time be a great want to carry on the Legall affairs of that Common-wealth; it may thus also be so ordered, that Thousands of the poor Natives of that Land, may be soon brought to conformity in Religion and manners with us, and all their youth be transplanted hither from time to time, and here b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed up and educated in good Nurture, and others exchanged and sent from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their rooms and steads to inhabit there, and all maintained by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd profits of those Lands; and thus in a short time, make that place to be as ci∣vill and fruitfull every way as this our mother Kingdom.</P>
<P>And he that doth well understand that government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st confesse, that the planting of that place heretofore by little and little, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of that Common-wealth, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="21" REF="14"/> together with the Idolatrous Inhabitants of the Land, and by making mar∣riages, and otherwise joyning with them, many of them have been suddenly perverted in their Religion, and scarce one of a Family hath continued Pro∣testants to a second Generation; and then it hath been observed, that such Proselytes once made, have proved the most despitefull and pernicious of all the rest to a generall reformation.</P>
<P>The Governours also of that Realm, for the most part heretofore, having so great power put into their hands, have been so lifted and puffed up with the conceipt and opinion of their greatnesse, that they have commonly for∣gotten their errand, and for what end they were placed there; and have been misled to all injustice and oppression of the people, to make themselves and their followers rich and honourable, out of the ruines and destruction of the subject, and therefore the government have been observed to be more pro∣sperous and happy, when it hath been by more Justices, then by any one De∣puty, or Lord Lieutenant of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>They have therefore humbly offered their sense and apprehension, that the Government there in the Parliaments power, be now rather ordered by Commissioners in the Provinces upon the place, then by any Lord Lieuten∣ant or Deputy, not only for the Reasons afore-said, but in respect also, that the Metropolitan City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> the usuall place of Residence and abode of all the Chief Governours of that Kingdom heretofore, is not at present un∣der the Parliaments power, where the Supreme Courts of Law and equity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Realm are usually kept, and where all the Parliaments Rolls and other Records of that Kingdom are remaining and upon Record, by which that whole government have been ever ordered and carried on, and without which it is not possible for any Lord Lieutenant, Deputy or Chief Governour for to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcise that authority in its fullnesse, and with such prosperous successe and effect as is heartily desired, nor so to manage such a power, as that he can equally and with justice, determine and decide such controversies and de∣bates, as will assuredly arise in judgement before him there, for want of such Records, and whereof if the Rebels should by any stratagem or strength of armes become Musters and possessed, no doubt but whatsoever thereof doth make against them, would quickly be cancelled and defaced, and of what dan∣gerous consequence that must inevitably prove unto this Crown and State, may be easily understood; and therefore whiles there is hopes for to reduce or bring the same again under the Parliaments power, all wayes and means would be used to make that place secure the first; besides that it stands si∣tuate for correspondence with <HI>England</HI> and the other parts of that King∣dom, the most convenient, and between the other Provinces, that no Deputy
<PB N="22" REF="15"/> or these Governours, to be sent into any other Province now in obedience to the Parliament, can possibly hold such intelligence, and keep such compli∣ance with the other parts of that Realm, as is necessary to carry on such a government; besides that, so great a Minister of State must be maintained in a port and degree like that which he represents, or it will subject his person and authority unto contempt; and if it shall come short of that Eminency ac∣customed to those that have swayed the Government before, it may be obser∣ved with disadvantage and much detriment to the proceedings every way. Nor is it 40000<SUP>lb</SUP>, as 'tis humbly conceived, will furnish one out to such an undertaking; which Money to be imployed for payment of the Souldier, will furnish 10000 Horse, and Foot into the Field there this next Summer, from out of the Province of <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> as is certified by the Commissioners from thence, with great expectation to reduce and settle all that part of the King∣dom in quiet: besides that, it is apprehended, that the Military Government in the Province of <HI>Ʋlster</HI> there, is by the Parliament already setled under the Command of his Excellency the Earl of <HI>Leven,</HI> where the Souldiers and Inhabitants are the most of them his Countrey men, and will undoubtedly be more ready and willing to fight under a Generall of their own Nation; and little else there is there to do for Civil affairs, which the Commissioners al∣ready sent, and more that may be sent from hence by the Parliament, may not easily perform, and save all this vast charge of a Deputy into the bargain: And for <HI>Munster,</HI> the Lord <HI>Inchiquin</HI> being made Lord President of that Pro∣vince by the Parliament already, in whose power both the Martiall and Civil Government being placed there, and he being a man, of whose fidelity the Parliament have had such an approved assurance, if he shall have some Com∣missioners also joyned with him, and sent thither for carrying on the Warre there, will be abundantly sufficient to answer whatsoever can be expected for managing the affairs in that Province, which of all other is a place the most considerable, and with all possible speed for to be supplied, as not only being the best part of that Kingdom, and most advantagious for this every way, but is more open and liable to the invasion of a forreign Enemy, and which will be the first part they will undoubtedly attempt; and those supplies which the Pope hath lately sent unto them of Money, Armes and Ammunition, with many other things of like consideration, do cleerly manifest a confederation of the Romish Catholique party thorowout Christendom to assist those Re∣bels, against which therefore now timely provision would be made while it is to day.</P>
<P>And as these were some motives in the generall, that induced the Adven∣turers to disburse their Monies for that service, and so earnestly for to contend
<PB N="23" REF="15"/> for the safety and preservation of that Kingdom, so for the particular of their Propositions, they were carried on to propose them for some other reasons also inducing them thereunto; as,</P>
<P>In the first place, to have a Confirmation of the Ordinance of the 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>July,</HI> 1643. for such cause as in their reasons herein aforesaid is mentioned.</P>
<P>And do humbly propose the second, as a thing of greatest equity, that those who have underwritten, and not paid in their Money, should bring it in as o∣thers, to helpe to carry on the Warre, and is but to turne that into an Ordi∣nance for this purpose, which the Houses of Parliament heretofore, after ma∣ny debates, agreed to be just, and drew up into an Act of Parliament, and sent unto his Majesty for his Royall assent, which he refusing, have not therefore taken away the justnesse of the Law.</P>
<P>And do propose the third, as beneficiall to the Service, and in no sort pre∣judiciall unto any; for as it shall not lose the first Subscriber any thing, so it will bring in more Money and more Adventurers, both to helpe to carry on the worke, and to plant the Kingdom, when the Warre is done; and the more that are engaged in the undertaking, must of necessity be most advantagious to the cause in generall.</P>
<P>And do propose the fourth, as a great expedient in this affair, to reduce those Rebels to their obedience the sooner, for now to grant the Rebels Lands and Estates in these Cities and Towns mentioned in the Proposition, upon condition to be presently planted, will not only bring in a good people to dwell amongst them, and Monies to helpe to maintain the Warre; but will exceedingly strengthen the proceeding, and encourage the Souldier to have his Countrey men, and those of his own Religion, in whom he may confide and trust thus about him, and to whom he may retire for comfort and refreshment, when he is wearied out with service, but will supply unto them many wants also there at home, which now they cannot purchase, when they have where∣withall so to do; it will also more fortifie those parts, when every such Planter, for his own security and the enjoyment of his purchase, will store and supply himself with men, Armes and necessaries, for to maintain his possession and inheritance.</P>
<P>And do propose the fift as most just and reasonable, that the Committee of Grocers-hall, who have contracted those debts, meerly for provisions sent thither for relief of the Souldier, should be disingaged thereof again by the Parliament, upon whose Commands they made the Provisions, and they con∣ceive it but just and reasonable (under favour and correction) that those who subscribed to pay in Monies upon that Ordinance of the 14<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>July,</HI> 1643. upon which the Committee looked, as a security for the reimbursement and
<PB N="24" REF="16"/> repayment of these Monies, should now therefore be compelled to pay in the same to satisfie those debts.</P>
<P>And do propose the sixt, as fit for consideration, that such Provisions as have been made for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and such Monies as have been raised for that Service, may not be diverted from that end for which it was originally intended; and that no private person may enjoy that to his own use, which was provided for the publike.</P>
<P>And do propose the seventh, as conducing more to the Service then any o∣ther particular, for if we shall not have Shipping to lye upon these Coasts continually, so much as may be to prevent the bringing in of Supplies unto the Rebels, they will be the more bold in the Rebellion, and enabled to op∣pose us.</P>
<P>And do propose the eight and ninth but as subservient to the rest, and very necessary to advance and borrow Monies for the Service upon all occasions.</P>
<P>And do propose the tenth, as a thing so considerable, that to be granted would bring in much Monies, with the love and bounty of the people; would ease them from other Taxes and Assessments, and would in no sort be burthen∣some or grievous, and would be a foundation and way laid, to carry on a great part of the Warre there unto the end of it, without troubling the Par∣liament and State upon every occasion, to seek out and finde new wayes to raise Monies for that Service, and which many times comes with murmur and grudgings of the people; and will engage many more Adventurers to plant there, when the Warre shall be ended; and is but of the same nature Monethly, as the Weekly meal which was raised lately in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>And do informe the eleventh, that the Committee may be rightly under∣stood, not to seek themselves; and to shew, they have no by ends of their own in all this they offer to perform, but to act freely and with publike spirits, as only looking to advance the good cause in hand, and nothing else.</P>
<P>And do propose the twelfth, for such reasons as they have herein formerly declared; all which they humbly submit to the consideration of the Parlia∣ment, and shall be well satisfied with whatsoever the Houses shall be pleased to resolve upon therein, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
