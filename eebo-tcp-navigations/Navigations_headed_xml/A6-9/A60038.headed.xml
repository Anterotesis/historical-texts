This Christian Practice so offended the then Autho∣rity, that a Law was made, entituled, <HI>An Act to prevent the People call'd Quakers from bringing their Negroes to their Meetings,</HI> (though it was in their own Houses) the Pe∣nalty being no less than the forfeiting of each Negroe that was found at a Meeting, or Ten pounds <HI>sterling</HI> a piece for each Negroe.</P>
<P>Some Friends were soon prosecuted by the same Law with great violence, and large expectations of the Inform∣ers: One <HI>Thomas Cobham</HI> began, and brought an Action against <HI>Ralph Fretwell,</HI> for Eighty Negroes of his own at a Meeting in his own Family, for Eight hundred pound <HI>sterling;</HI> and also against <HI>Lewis Morris,</HI> for a very great Sum; the said <HI>Cobham</HI> being countenanced by one <HI>John Merrick,</HI> a Justice of the Peace, and an Assistant of the Court where the Actions were to be tried; and after seve∣ral Courts, Judgment was given in favour of the Defen∣dants, to the great Disappointment of the Envious, espe∣cially one <HI>Charles Collins</HI> a Lawyer, who used his utmost Skill in behalf of the Informers. But the abovesaid <HI>Thomas Cobham</HI> the Informer, who of a lusty likely young man, in a small time became dejected, being generally slighted, and his company refused by several for being an Informer; and soon after was taken with a Fever and Swelling in his Neck and Throat, which daily increased in a very strange man∣ner; so that towards his latter End, he cried out, <HI>Fire, fire, he was all on fire;</HI> and said to his Mother, <HI>She need not provide a Coffin for him, for he should be burnt up before it was made;</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>crying out, <HI>Neither Heaven nor Hell, but all fire, fire;</HI> and cried saying, <HI>Now the Quakers will say, It is a Judgment fal∣len on me.</HI> After this manner did this miserable man end his Days.</P>
<P>Soon after died <HI>John Daw</HI> of a Surfeit by Drinking, who was an Instrument in this evil Work. Also,</P>
<P><HI>John Mackfashion,</HI> one of the Evidences, never thrived afterwards, but in a small time died of that deplorable Dis∣ease called the Belly-ake.</P>
<P>And the aforesaid Justice, <HI>John Merrick,</HI> riding to his own House in Drink, was thrown by his Horse, to the hurt∣ing of his Brain, (though no outward appearance) who continued some few days in a violent raving condition, to the Terror of his Friends, and then died.</P>
<P><HI>William Sharp,</HI> an Eminent Man, and Judge of a Court, was a great Opposer of our Labour with these poor Ne∣groes; who riding from his own House to the <HI>Bridge Town,</HI> (seemingly very well) fell from his Horse before he got to the Town, and we cannot understand that he ever spake afterwards (except <HI>O my Head</HI>) and in three or four Days afterwards died.</P>

<HEAD>Alexander Ruddock,</HEAD>
<P>A Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and Judge of a Court, and one of the Council, and of the Nation of <HI>Scot∣land:</HI> He appeared, without any just Cause, very bitter and envious against us: He caused a Friend to be rated 400 pounds of Sugar towards payment of the Priests Wages, (who never wrought for him) the Priest being his Son in-Law; for which was taken from the said Friend a Cow worth Ten Pound <HI>sterling;</HI> and upon Complaint of the said Friend, and upon Enquiry, there was but ten pounds of Su∣gar appeared to be their pretended Due: For the Poors
<PB N="20" REF="11"/>part, and for mending Highways, we duely pay; but this being the Priests part, he could not for Conscience pay; yet was this unjust Action vindicated by the said <HI>Ruddock,</HI> not∣withstanding some of the Magistrates that were at the hear∣ing of the matter, would have had the Cow returned to the right Owner; but because the said Friend had com∣plained of the Wrong and Oppression, he the said <HI>Ruddock</HI> being Judge of the Quarter Sessions, caused him to be fi∣ned five pounds <HI>sterling,</HI> because he could not take the Oath of a Constable (which for Conscience-sake he only refused) although he was willing to have performed the Office, ac∣cording to his Ability and Understanding, if he might have been permitted without an Oath, which several Friends had been, by moderate Magistrates, and found to perform the same honestly and diligently: For which Fine, the said <HI>Ruddock</HI> the Judge issued out his Warrant against the said Friend to a Constable, upon which was taken from him a Negroe Woman, which they had to the Constables House, where <HI>Ruddock</HI> was himself, and so ordered the matter, that the said Negroe was valued but at two thousand three hundred pounds of Sugar, which as the price of Sugar then went, might amount to 11 <HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> which Negroe was sold some time after for 26 <HI>l.</HI> and was all kept for the Fine of 5<HI>l.</HI> And the said Friend having suffered above Seven thousand pounds of Sugar in one year by his means, which the said Friend laid before him in the presence of his Daughter, the Priests Wife, telling him he had suffered all that for com∣plaining of the Wrong he had done him about his Cow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at which he seemed greatly to rejoyce, and said it should be so yearly, so long as he was Magistrate: But he did not live a year after. He shewed his great willingness and desire to persecute Friends on all occasions; and the last time he sat in Council, and knowing there was an Order form the Gover∣nour to break up Friends Meetings, he staid after the Coun∣cil
<PB N="21" REF="11"/>broke up, which was late, for the Order to break up our Meeting in his Precincts, and promised the Governour di∣ligently to obey all his Commands: But calling at Judge <HI>Rees,</HI> in his way home, was taken ill; but went home, and calling for a Medicine called <HI>Cream of Tartar,</HI> which he used to take in his Broth, by his own mistake took <HI>Arse∣nick</HI> instead thereof, and so wretchedly ended his Days; which may be a Warning to others.</P>
<P>He threatned that with the Money taken from us, there should be a Prison built for us: He would not let us eat fresh Meat, and went to take away the Meat which a Friend bought in the Market, saying he would have it, although the Butcher told him several times that he had sold it, and was receiving the Money fot it.</P>
<P>Another Friend having bought Meat in the Market, and the Butcher carrying it to his House, was met in the way by the said <HI>Ruddock,</HI> who commanded him to carry it back into the Market, saying, <HI>They shall not eat fresh Meat;</HI> the man turned back, and durst not carry the Friend his Meat which he had bought of him. He was for putting Negroes to Death for Example, saying, <HI>What was it for Barbadoes to put twenty or thirty Negroes to Death yearly for Example-sake.</HI> He caused some Friends to be prick'd for Constables, on purpose to Fine them, saying it should be so every year. This is but a branch of his Cruelty, for he made great spoil of Friends Goods upon the Militia-Ac∣count, as he was Colonel: It is wonderful to conceive how a man should be so filled with prejudice against a Peo∣ple that never gave him any just occasion. But his mea∣sure being filled, he was cut off as before related.</P>
<P>Priest <HI>Kenny</HI> his Country-man preach'd his Funeral Ser∣mon, and declared as followeth—<HI>That he had attained to the Prudence of a Judge, the Dignity of a Colonel, and the
<PB N="22" REF="12"/>Honour of a Counsellor; and that he had served his King and Countrey faithfully, and died a Saint.</HI> His Text was, <HI>I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith,</HI> &amp;c. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.7. How this suited with his Actions, we leave the Reader the Judge.</P>

<HEAD>Sir <HI>Timothy Thorn hill,</HI> and Major General, (So Called)</HEAD>
<P>A Man who wanted not will to have taken away our Lives, as he often threatned; a Man full of wicked and blasphemous Discourse; and it may be said of him, <HI>He neither feared God nor Man,</HI> as his following Actions will declare: Being at a Feast, and drinking to excess, and some of them refusing to drink so hard, <HI>he wished himself God Almighty, that he might Damn the Souls of them that would not drink:</HI> Another time, being in company where a Wo∣man being speaking in discourse of the Power and Omni∣potency of Almighty God, he replied, <HI>God Damn ye, go to the top of yonder Tree,</HI> (pointing to a Tree near them) <HI>and tumble down, and see if God Almighty can save you from break∣ing your Neck before you come to the bottom.</HI> A Friend stand∣ing by, reprehended him for such wicked Expressions, for which he beat the Friend, calling him <HI>Son of a Whore,</HI> and asked <HI>if he were to be taught by him?</HI> A Friend being brought before him for not appearing in Arms, told him <HI>he could not for Conscience-sake;</HI> to which he replied, <HI>God Damn your Conscience; if I cannot make your Conscience bow, I'll make your stubborn Dogs Back bend;</HI> and so ty'd him Neck and Heels with his own hands, with that Violence and Rage, that almost deprived him of Life. Articles of War being published in this Island, he then swore desperately <HI>that now he had power, and would put them in E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecution, and the
<PB N="23" REF="12" MS="y"/>first time an Enemy appeared, he would hang up the Quakers;</HI> binding his words with bitter Oaths (without which he could hardly speak.) He having been lately sick, and pret∣ty well recovered, boasted among his Companions of his Conquest over Death, and that <HI>he had taken a New Lease of his Life from God Almighty for Thirty years longer,</HI> and so continued in his Wickedness, and hath often been heard to say, <HI>He would live more in a Month, than others should in a Year.</HI> But in few months this poor Man was visited again by the hand of the Lord, and his large Measure be∣ing full, the Thread of his Life was cut asunder, notwith∣standing his New Lease; Unlamented by the moderate People of the Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d, and Curst by others, who lost con∣siderably by him; who notwithstanding a great Estate left him by his Father, died (by a moderate Caleulation) Eight thousand pounds <HI>sterling</HI> worse than nothing, as is credibly discoursed, and heavily felt by the Sufferers.</P>
