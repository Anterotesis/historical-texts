<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Fortunatus</HI>'s Parentage and Birth in the famous Island of <HI>Cy∣prus;</HI> How growing up in Learning and Knowledge, his Father, by his Lavishness, was reduced to Poverty; and he going to seek his Fortune, was entertain'd by the Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> in his return from <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> how the Servants envyed him for the Love their Lord bore him: with the Stratagem they used to make him secretly withdraw from his Service, to the great Grief of the Earl.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>IN the renowned City of <HI>Famogosta,</HI> in the pleasant Island of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> in times past, there dwelt one <HI>Thedorius,</HI> descended of noble Pa∣rentage, who left him a great Estate, but being brought up to no∣thing but Pleasure, he pursued it so far in all manner of Sports and Riots, that it consum'd a-pace: his friends being grieved hereat, thought of no better way to check his proceedings, and bring him with∣in bounds of Moderation, than by matching him to some discreet Wo∣man, whose Wisdom and good Humour might bring him to live soberly and fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gally. This being, concluded on, contrary to his Knowledge, upon diligent search, they found one, suitable to what they had proposed; in the City of <HI>Nicovia,</HI> a virtuous young Virgin, Daughter to a Merchant, rich and beautiful, whose name was <HI>Grati∣ana;</HI> and proposing it to him, with many Reasons and Arguments, how much it would be for his good, he resolved to visit her, and liking
<PB REF="2"/> her comely shape, good features, but above all, her modest carriage, and witty expressions suiting his Humour, after a few months Court∣ship, they were married in splended manner, most of the principal Men of either City being at the Wedding, who gave large gifts, as it is the Custom, to the Bride and Bridegroom; and so for many years they lived in Content and great Felicity, in which space they had a Son whom they named <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> at whose Christening an old Wo∣man taken to be a Prophetess, came in and uttered these Words:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>The Child is Fortune's Darling, he shall share,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ʋnsought, those Riches which she will prepare;</HI></L>
<L><HI>To Travel he his Thoughts full soon will bend;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Though cross'd in some, yet all shall happy end.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>This was noted of many but more particularly when the Success an∣swered her Prediction. As he grew up, his Father, not be restrain∣ed by the tears and intreaties of his Wife, squandred away all his Pa∣trimony; which much grieved <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> tho' he saw no way to re∣dress it; and his Father too late seeing his Folly, fell into a deep me∣lancholy, often sighing, and shedding Tears, which so afflicted his Son, that thinking he might have done something that grieved him, he came and kneel'd before him, entreating to know what caused his Afflictions, and if he had contributed towards them, he would amend, and do a∣ny thing that might be pleasing in his sight? But the sorrowful Fa∣ther sighing, told him, He had been very dutiful, which was the greatest comfort he had; yet being afflicted with Poverty, which had brought him to be despised by his Inferiours, it much afflicted him. Upon this <HI>Fortunatus</HI> begged leave to rid him of the charge he put him to, by suffering him to travel, not doubting, as he said, con∣sidering his Education, but he should shift for himself; and Fortune might so befriend him, and enable him to do for him and his Mother, who had been so tender, and gave him such liberal Education. His Father easily consented, but his Mother not without great Reluctancy; but finding there was a necessity for it, with many tender embraces they parted. <HI>Fortunatus</HI> having the World to ramble in, made to the Sea, and at the next Haven found a great many armed Men landed, which at the first made him start, as supposing it an Invasion of the Island; but he upon enquiry, found it was <HI>Baldwin,</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> who had put on shoar to refresh him, in his return from the Wars against the Turks and Sarazens in the <HI>Holy Land;</HI> he took courage, and kneeling before the Earl, offer'd his Service, telling him he was put forth to seek his Fortune, and that he would be very subservient to his Commands. The Earl eying him, and perceiving
<PB REF="3"/> him a very promising Youth, of a comely Personage, after a little en∣quiry into the Circumstances of his Parentage and former Life, he made him his chief Servant; and so well he behaved himself, that he gained this great Lord's entire Affection, and so departed with him in the Gally to the next Port, which was the famous City of <HI>Venice,</HI> built in a Marsh in the Sea, about three Leagues from the main Land, and desended from the raging of the Ocean with mighty Banks and monsterous Pits; through whole Streets run several Chanels, so that great Boats and Lighters came with Goods and Merchandize to the Doors of their Houses; <HI>Fortunatus</HI> knew the Language of this Country, which he had learn'd from a Venetion in his own; so that meeting with divers Merchants there, he bought up, by his Lord's Order, store of Jewels and other rich Merchandize, which wonderfully pleased him, the which he intended to bestow upon the Duke of <HI>Cleve</HI>'s Daughter to whom he was contracted (before his going to the War) and at his return designed to marry; and at this Marriage being Justs and Turnaments, the Earl, to encourage his Servants to do well, set up a Jewel valued at three hundred Crowns, to those that should overcome, after the Nobles and Knights had ended their Debates: <HI>Fortunatus</HI> carried the Prize from them all, which made 'em greatly envy him, and the more, because a new Comer should have the advantage of their Lord's Favour; and so they con∣sulted together to find out a Contrivance to remove him; which they effected by this Stratagem, one <HI>Robert,</HI> an old Servant, came to him as he was reading, and told him, that their Lord being to depart and leave his Bride, was by reason of her Beauty so jealous, that he had ordered Surgeons to come the next morning, to secure himself of his Servants, by gelding them. This so terrified <HI>Fortunatus</HI> (the Man urging he reveal'd this in Good-will to him) that without fur∣ther consideration he besought him to help him to make his Escape for he would not be so served for his Lord's Earldom▪ <HI>Robert</HI> observing this, told him he was loath to part with him; but if he would go, he de∣sired to know where he would reside that when the rest were gelded, and his Lords Jealousie over, he might return to his Service again, and very probably escape: But he said, he would not return again, whate∣ver betide him; so getting a Horse (he was lead by <HI>Robert,</HI> who inward∣ly was pleased, and laughed in his sleeve at the Fallacy he had put up∣on him) and being without the Gate, rode away with all the speed he could; never looking behind him, till he was many Miles from the Palace.</P>
<P>The Earl, at his return missing <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> made great enquiry
<PB REF="3"/> for him; but the Servants utterly denyed they knew what was be∣come of him, then he asked his Lady, whether she had given him a∣ny cause of Offence; but she was altogether ignorant of any such thing, so he was forced to content himself, though much against his will, saying, However he should at one time or other find it out, and he would severely punish the Occasioners of it; which made <HI>Ro∣bert,</HI> who had contrived his flight much affraid, lest he should return, and make a discovery of what Stratagem had been used, to cause his absenting his Lord's Service.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How travelling through many Countries, he embarked for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and was entertained by a Florentine Merchant; who together with all the Family, being falsely accused of the Murther of a Knight of the King's Court, was with the rest condemned to die; and by what means he on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y escaped and went for <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> getting away in manner aforesaid, was resolved to fol∣low Fortune; and so, coming by divers ways to <HI>Callis,</HI> he got passage for <HI>England,</HI> where he fell into the Company of two <HI>Cyprus</HI> Merchants, and lived with them righteously, spending in Wine and upon Harlots, till his and their Stocks was utterly exhausted; and be∣ing in a poor condition (void of Succou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) his Mistress, on whom he had spent his Pleasure, thrusted him out of Doors, and refused to relieve him; as he wander'd about <HI>London,</HI> he was taken notice of by one <HI>Jerinomus Roberti,</HI> a Florentine Merchant, who examin∣ing him, found he was of a prompt Wit and Education, and therefore
<PB REF="4"/> agreed with him to come into his Service, which he joyfully accepted and being acquainted with the Customs of Merchants, was so dili∣gent (and so well behaved himself) that he got the good Esteem, not only of his Master, but of all the Servants, who entirely loved him: But soon after a great Calamity befel the Family, by means of a Vil∣lain, which cost all, but <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> their Lives, and he very narrow∣ly escaped; for one <HI>Andrew,</HI> a young Spend-thrift Florentine, having been sent by his Father, to sell a Cargo of Goods, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avished away all the Money he had for them, but continued to draw Bills up∣on the old Man, with promises of large returns, till he had near ru∣ined him before he had discover'd the Cheat; at what time being put to his shifts, he left <HI>England,</HI> and went for <HI>Bruges,</HI> where hearing of an English Merchant who lay in Irons in a noisome Dungeon, for forging the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Pass-port, he went to visit him. The Merchant no sooner knew he cam from <HI>England,</HI> but he was ex∣ceeding glad, enquiring what News, and the Welfare of his Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, all which he told him as well as he understood: The Merchant said, <HI>You see what in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ser able condition I lie here, if you would return to</HI> England, <HI>and acquaint my Friends with it, I make no doubt but they will use their Purses, and Interest at Court to release me.</HI> To be brief, he promised to do it up∣on consideration of three hundred Crowns, and so took the Names of those Friends he proposed, and Mony for his passage.</P>
<P>Now among this Merchant's Friends, was <HI>Roberti, Fortunatus</HI>'s Master, by which means this wicked Florentine came acquainted with him to his ruin; for having proposed to lay down three hundred Crowns for the Merchant's Ransom, if any others would come in for Part-Security, <HI>Andrew</HI> at last told him, he had found a Gentleman of a great Estate that would do it, and that he should provide a Dinner, and he would bring him; this being agreed to, he went to a Knight of the Court, whom the King had employed to get the richest Jewels that might be had, to make a Present to his Sister, who was to be married to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> telling him there was a Jeweller of <HI>Florence,</HI> who hearing of the King's Enquiry after Rarities, was come over with such, that the like had never been seen in the Nation, and so invited him to come and see 'em at <HI>Roberti</HI>'s, where he said, he lodged, desiring him to bring his own with him, that they might compare them. The Knight little dreaming of the Treachery de∣signed, promised so to do, and accordingly came, when after Dinner having him into a private Chamber he stabbed him, but for what reason we knew not, for he had not brought the Jewels with him, whereupon he took his Keys and his Signet, and ran to his House,
<PB REF="4"/> delivering them to his Wife as a Token to give him the Jewels, for the King was to send them away; upon search she could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind none, nor were they found for some time after; so that the Murtherer, frustrated of his expected Prize, came to <HI>Roberti</HI>'s again, where the Murther was discover'd by the dropping of the Blood through the Cei∣ling, but he laboured to calm their O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teries, by saying, The Murther∣ed was a meer Cut-throat, and designed to have killed him for this Mony; however, he would rid them of the Body: and so taking it on his Shoulder, he threw it into a Privy, and fled by a Back-way for fear of being apprehended.</P>
<P>The Knight being missing, great enquiry was made; this Mer∣chant's House, where they had Intelligence, he went, was searched, but nothing found, till being about to depart, one cryed, <HI>Come, let's see in the Privy, we have not searched that yet:</HI> And there, by throw∣ing in a lighted Paper, they saw the Murthered's heels standing up∣right. The King being certified of this, the Merchant and his Ser∣vants were examined by Tortures, all of them confessing what they knew of the Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, but <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> whom they had kept ignorant of it, he being then abroad: But of the Jewels they could tell nothing, so that hereupon they were condemned to be hanged; and of seven, only <HI>Fortunatus</HI> escaped, at the Gallows, by the others protesting his Innocence in the Matter. About half a Year after, the Widow of the Knight being advised to think of a young Lover, and remove her Bed into another Room, to put her out of her Melancholy, putting the latter in practice, found a little Cabinet under it, and in it the Jewels; which, by the Advice of a Kinsman, she carried to the King, who, for her Fidelity, gave her the Mannor of <HI>Woodstock,</HI> and caus∣ed a young Knight to marry her, settling a thousand Pounds a Year up∣on them during their Lives.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunatus</HI> having lost his Master, and happily 'scap'd the Gallows, grew so fearful of such another bout, that he resolved to stay no longer in <HI>England,</HI> but getting on board, soon sailed over to <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> being freed from another Danger, left the City, and resolved to go for <HI>Paris;</HI> when passing thro' a great Wood, and being at a loss which way to go, as he gazed about, he saw a comely Shape, in Woman's Apparel, crossing his way, and coming up to him, he demanded who she was, and her Business in that Desart: <HI>My Name,</HI> reply'd she, <HI>is</HI> Fortune; <HI>and here am I placesed by the Great Distributed and Disposer of all the things, by whose command I have Power to give six Things to such as stand in need of them; for but one of them can, by my means, fall to any one Man's share: Be prudent in your Choice, for you may not chuse again.</HI> He now supposed he had found his good Angel, which made him greatly rejoyce, and re∣flecting on his former Poverty, he chose Riches, saying, <HI>Give me so much that I may never be poor again,</HI> so he well knew what Power Money had in the World, it answering all things, as, make a Knave pass for an honest Man, a Fool for a Wit, a Dowdy for a Beauty, a Coward for a valiant Man, upon this she gave him a Purse curiously wrought in Needle-work, with various Figures of Providence workt
<PB REF="5"/> thereon in Silk, Gold and Pearl, saying, <HI>Take this Purse, and be thankful for it to Almighty God; for in whatsoever Land thou art, put thy Hand into it, and you shall as often as you do so, draw out ten Angels of Gold of that Country Coin.</HI> For this he gave her a thousand Thanks, leaping for Joy to which she rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, <HI>Direct them to the Divine Giver of all things; I am but the Hand to distri∣bute them as he Directs: For</HI> continued she, <HI>I neither see, nor have regard to the Persons on whom I bestow them, but am always Hood∣wink'd as you see, therefore had Wisdom been your P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion, she would have taught you better.</HI> Upon this <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> bowing low, beg∣ged her Pardon: Then she bid him not be proud, but always cha∣ritable and curteous to the Poor; and then the Virtue of the Purse should hold to him and his Children, and no longer; then directing him out of the Wood, she vanished from his sight; which made him greatly wonder, and scarcely believe but it was a Vision, and nothing of Reality in it, till coming to an Inn, he tried the Experiment, and found it to be otherwise: But his Garments were so poor, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, till he saw his Money, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to let him have either Vi∣ctuals or Drink, but seeing him draw out Gold so fast, he began to be sweet upon him, made him a Fire, carried him into the best Room, ordering his Daughter diligently to attend him; the best in the House being at his Service; so that he staid there all Night: And seeing a curious imbroider'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for a Horse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e asked his Host to whose Horse it belong'd; <HI>To none,</HI> said he, <HI>at present, for it is left here to be sold.</HI> Upon which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to beat it no longer upon the Hoof, since he had such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to buy a Horse, bargained w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> him for it for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and the next Morning there being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to a Village ten Miles furthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> stood on a Hill, here he put i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> know if there were any good Horses to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost told him there was a Merchant ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y arrived, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very stately ones out of <HI>Barbary,</HI> which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at the Feast that was to be held there upon the Duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, which suddenly was to commence: Upon this he desired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> seeing him so meanly clad, inwardly laughed, knowing the Horses were of great Price, yet, seeing some Money, to humour his Guest, he went with him, and agreeing, contrary to his expectation, he payed 3 hundred Crowns for them, and brought them to the Inn, then he supposed him to be some noble Man in disguise, especially when he asked him for to help him to two Servants, he designing to keep them to attend
<PB REF="6"/> him. But long they had not passed away the time merrily before Duke <HI>Redolphus,</HI> who had bid Money for the Horses, sent for them at the Merchant's Price, they having differed before; but when he un∣derstood they were sold, he stormed grievously, and sent to know who it was that durst buy them out of his Hands: The Host told the Messen∣ger, It was a Stranger in plain Habit newly come, which he at first, did not think was capable of purchasing an Ass. Whereupon he sent to apprehend him, suspecting he had committed some Robbery; and notwithstanding all his Excuses he could make, sent him to Pri∣son, and compelled him, e're he could be delivered from the Misery he suffered there, to deliver the Horses up to him, to pay three hundred Crowns as a Fine set upon him, and ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged to depart his Terri∣tories, with an Oath, never to discover what passed between 'em.</P>
<P>Upon this hard Hap, he went to <HI>Anguries,</HI> a considerable City in that Province, and there appeared very splendid at the Duke of <HI>Saxo∣ny</HI>'s wedding; buying him Horses, and getting him Seravnts with an extraordinary Equipage, so that he past for a Noble Man, taking up the best Inn, keeping Company, and equally spending with the Nobili∣ty and Gentry of the best Rank, who mightily esteemed him.</P>

<P>The first Port he touched at, was <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> where, as the Custom was, he immediately went to make a Present to the Soldian, which he did in▪ such rich Jewels, that, that mighty Prince admir'd at it, and thereupon entertain'd him very nobly, sending him in Requstal very rich Merchandize, and left him a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Liberty to traffick in things of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> above the Liberty granted to o∣ther Merchants, inviting him in a short space after to Dinner, and gave a Charge concerning his Freedom and Entertainment in all Pla∣ces, so that having richly fraited his Ship, he sent it by the Master to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> consigned to the Use of his Wife and Children, resolving with ten Servants to travel over the Land; and so taking his leave of the Soldan, who gave him Letters of safe Conduct, directed to di∣ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Princes: He resolved to pass over the Deserts of <HI>Ara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia</HI> and <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsia,</HI> and so to <HI>India,</HI> ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <HI>Tartary</HI> in his Way, where he had a View of the great <HI>Cham's</HI> Court at <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ia,</HI> but the People being barbarous and unciviliz'd in most Parts of▪ that Country, he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n left it, and in his Way the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce through a vast Forrest, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ds toward <HI>India,</HI> he sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>strous Tygar, who had before destroyed many hundreds of People, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft the Way almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>frequented by Passengers, which was seattered with the Skulls and Bones of those that had been devoured.

<P>This, by the Advice of the King and Queen, the Princess under took to discover; which she thought she might the better do, because she perceived he was deeply in Love with her, and in a little time she shewed him such Kindness, that he was admitted to be in private with her in her Chamber, a Favour which none before had received; and there being no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e but they, he thought it was now his time to declare his Passion; which he did in such obliging Terms that she seem'd to be pleased with it; only saying, <HI>Your lavish Expences, I fear will bring us both to Poverty, should I marry with you.</HI> He told her that could not be, for his Treasure, during his Life, was inexhaustible, and cou'd not be wasted, spend what he would, <HI>Why then,</HI> says she, <HI>you are certainly the Son of some great Prince? No,</HI> said he, <HI>I am not the Son of a Prince, my Father is dead, his Estate was equal with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, and never can be more or less. Well,</HI> replied she, <HI>satisfie me in this Point, and then perhaps I may grant you my Favour. for if you love me truly, as you say you do, you will conceal nothing from me: Let me know (I say) from whence you have these great Riches? Ah!</HI> said he, <HI>divinest Lady, it was my dying Father's Command, not to discover it to any; yet so dearly I love you, that I can deny you nothing: No, if my Father's Ghost should now rise and for∣bid it, so your Highness will be pleased to promise to keep it secret.</HI> To this she obliged herself; and he, drunk with Love, thereupon shewed her his Purse, told her how it was come by, and all the Secrets of it; letting her seeing it experimentally, by pulling out several Handfuls of Gold, which he presented her with; telling her so he could do all Day long, and every Day as long as he liv'd. This made her inwardly rejoyce; and from that time plotted how to get it, which she effected under the Colour of a Promise he should lie with her before Marriage, if he would swear to be true to her, when she had rendred up to him her Virgin-treasure. But, whilst he expected, with a multitude of Joy, the Frution of her delicate Body, she contrived with her Woman, to give him Drugs in his Wine; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drinking him lustily, he fell fast asleep; then turning aside his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he took his Purse, and fastned
<PB REF="11"/> another to his Girdle of the same likeness, but different in Vertue, so that waking in the Morning, and finding himself in a Chair, he be∣gan to wonder what had befallen him: but just as he remembred his Assignation with <HI>Agrippina,</HI> in came her Woman, who told him, in a sorrowful Tone, that the fair Princess going to Bed, and keeping awake in expectation of him, and he deceiving her she was risen very angry. This made him very blank and sorrowful, that he had lost an Opportunity he should not reasonably expect again; supposing it down by Necromancy, at the Instance of some of his Rivals, to disappoint him of his Joys: and so arising, he went to his own House, being a∣shamed to see the Princess, as fearing her Reproaches: little dream∣ing he had lost his Treasure.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>Agrippina</HI> had shew'd the Purse to the King and Queen, and told them the Virtue of it: whereupon the King would have had it in his keeping, but the Queen told him, seeing the Princess had so fairly ventured for it, she ought to keep it. And now they resolved to put a Trick upon <HI>Andolocia:</HI> whereupon the King sent to tell him, he designed to come with the Queen and Princess to Dine with him that Day: The Messenger had no sooner delivered his Messuage, and was departed, hut he called his Steward, and bid him immedi∣ately provide Provision: but he told him, in the last two Feasts his Mony was all expended, and therefore he must have more. Where∣upon <HI>Andolocia</HI> put his Hand readily into his Purse, but found no∣thing: when looking wishfully on it, he perceived it was changed. This made him look blank, not knowing for a time, what to say or do: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he knew the Vertue of it was so rare, that those who had it, would never part with it by fair means. And so, pretending his Brother was dead, he turned off all his Servants, sold his Houshold∣furniture, and privately getting on Shipboard he sail'd for <HI>Cyprus,</HI> telling his Brother <HI>Ampedo,</HI> the lamentable News of the Loss of the Purse; which greatly grieved him, and made him blame <HI>Andolo∣cia</HI> for his Folly, and the Breach of his Father's last Commands: yet he relieved his Wants plentifully: But he as badly rewarded him, for having gotten what Treasure he could, he desired him to lend him his Wishing cap, but he a long time refused it, saying, That should be is last Reserved when all his Money was spent: and he doubted not, but when some great Prince should come to know of its Vertue, but to get ten thousand Pounds for it: and if he let him have it, he wou'd lose it as foolishly as he had done the Purse. To this he said nothing, but one Day, desiring to see it, the other Bro∣ther obliged him so far, when having it in his Hand, he clapped it on
<PB REF="11"/> his Head, wishing himself at <HI>Venice,</HI> and he was immediately there; leaving him to repent his Folly in the Loss of his Cap, as he had done his, in that of his Purse: Being in this rich City, he found out di∣vers Jews who were rich Jewellers, and cheapning divers of great Value, and grasping them fast in his Hand, and wishing himself in <HI>England,</HI> he was immediately carried thro' the Air, to their great Admiration, who concluded him to be no less than the Devil, and rejoyced they had taken none of his Money, lest he should have come again, and fetcht away all their other Riches.</P>

<P>BEing in <HI>England,</HI> he disguised himself in the Habit of an Italian Merchant; and going to Court, enquir'd for the Princess <HI>Agrip∣pina:</HI> And being brought before her, he laid out his Jewels, and proffered her them to Sale, so that in a little time they agreed, now that which he looked for was the Purse, out of which he supposed she would take the Money, for he suspected she had it, and accordingly it succeeded: For going to a Coffer, and taking it out, he fastned it to her
<PB REF="12"/> Girdle; when he having his Wishing cap on, clasped her in his Arms, and wishing himself in a wild Desert, away they flew together over Sea and Land, till they came into a vast Wilderness, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and there he set her down, faint and almost breathless, under a Tree, on which grew very curious Apples to see to; whereupon, casting her Eyes upon them, she intreated him to gather some of them to quench her Thirst, for she was almost ready to perish with Drought: Where∣upon he, still loving her, tho' she had served him such a slippery Trick, clapped, unadvisedly, his Cap on her Head to keep off the scorching Sun, as knowing she knew not the Vertue of it; and so climbing up, fell to gathering; in the mean while she sat pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sive and sad; and all on a sudden wishing to God she were out of that desolate Place, and in her Father's Court, all on a sudden, contrary to her Expectation, she was carried away; leaving <HI>Andolocia</HI> to fret at his folly, and vex himself more than ever: So, wandring up and down, faint and weary, at length he sat down by the Brook, and fell to eating of his Apples, when immediately a grievous Pain seiz'd his Head, so that he supposed them infectious, and began to fear his Life; but on the contrary a great Pair of Goat's Horns sprung out of his Forehead, and then the Pain ceased: This made him wonder at himself, and stand amazed; but as he was sad and pensive, an old Hermet came to him, and seeing him a Stranger and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> invited him to his Cave, and gave him such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had, which consisted of Nuts, wild Apples and Roots <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> proceeded from a pleasant Brook hard by: But <HI>Andolocia</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sollicitous about his Horns, than any thing else, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Hermet, that if he knew any way, he would use it to cure him, and he would give him ten Crowns, which was all the Money he had left; for <HI>Agrippina</HI> had carried away the Jewels as well as the Hat: But though he promised to cure him, yet he refused his Money, telling him, he had retired from the World, and the Vanities of it, and Money to him was useless; but going a∣broad, he brought home six fair Apples, two of which <HI>Andolocia</HI> had no sooner eaten, but his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dropt off, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him greatly re∣joyce: So the good old Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idding him give Glory to God, led him out of the Forrest, and at the Edge of it they parted.</P>
<P><HI>Andolocia</HI> having some of the Hornifying Apples, and likewise four of the contrary Quality, began to meditate Revenge on <HI>Agrippi∣na;</HI> and so, coming with all speed for <HI>England,</HI> he changed his Garb, and got an Opportunity to present them to her as Fruit grow∣ing in the holy Garden of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to restore decayed Beauty; and keep Health for several Years, make the Aged look Young, and
<PB REF="12"/> many other Wonders, but she had no sooner eat two of them, and finding a Drowsiness, lying down to sleep, and dreaming she was turned into a Goat, but awaking, she found a strange Alteration, and going to her Glass; and seeing her Horns, affrighted, she start∣led and shrieked out, whereupon her Ladies came about her, and were as much affrighted at the sight as she: but a grave Matron, who had been her Nurse, advised them to be silent, to prevent the Disgrace that might follow; till Physicians where consulted, whose Skill might take them away; so she kept close in her Chamber, and the old Women was sent to divers Doctors, but none of them would undertake it at the Penalty she would impose on them, which was two thousand Crowns, if she revealed the Lady's Name, and they did not cure her. But as she was coming back again very pensive, <HI>Ando∣locia,</HI> in the Garb of a Physician. Met her, and told her, by her Sad∣ness, and coming from such a Doctor's House, he guessed she had some dear Friend in danger of Life, or some other great Distress; which if she would accept of his Service, as a Physician, he would not doubt, with the Blessing of God, to Cure.</P>
<P>The old Woman believing him, greatly rejoyced that she had found him so opportunely: and telling him the whole matter, which he very well knew before, convey'd him to the Princess's Chamber privately at a Back-door, where he found her lying on her Bed very pensive: But she was comforted, when he told her he was come to cure her: so he begun to make his Application and gave her so little of the Apple among the Drugs, that they only wasted by Degrees, then telling her he wanted some costly Drugs to make them come off by the Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and so she shou'd be more beautiful than ever she arose and went to her Cos∣fer: In the mean while searching about the Room, he found his Wish∣ing cap carelesly thrown under the Bed; for she knew not the Vertue, of it, but supposed the Devil had carried her backward and forward be∣fore: By this time she called him to her to receive the Mony; and he drawing her toward the Window, that he might, as he pretended the better discern it, drew his Hat from under his Coat, clapt it on his Head, grasp'd her in his Arms, and away he flew with her, Purse and all. This caus'd great Wailing in the Court, and made the King and Queen repent she had ever meddled with the Purse, verily believing <HI>An∣dolocia</HI> was a Conjurer. In this Airy Voyage she was carried into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and set down in the Forrest af <HI>Andevia,</HI> where presenting him∣self to her in his true Shape, and with a ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countenance reproaching her with Threachery and Inconstancy; she, bathing her lovely Face in Tears, fell on her knees, and begged his Pardon. Whereupon, tak∣ing
<PB REF="13"/> pitty of her, at her request he put into a Nunnery giving the Abbess two hundred Crowns for her Admittance, promising to fetch her so soon as he cou'd find a Remedy to take off her Horns; and so de∣parted for <HI>Cyprus</HI> with his Hat and Purse, the sight of which greatly rejoyced <HI>Ampedo,</HI> to whom he told all the passage of his Travels: and so extolled the Beauty of <HI>Agrippina,</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> enamour'd on bare Report, prevail'd with the King his Father to send an Ambassey, to desire her in Marriage: whereupon <HI>Andolocia</HI> was solicited to free her from the Nunnery, which he did, taking off her Horns, and carrying her thro' the Air to <HI>London:</HI> and then returning again, Embassadors, with great Presents; and the Prince's Picture, where sent. And she, remembring what <HI>Andolocia</HI> had said of the Beau∣ty and Vertue of that Prince, consented, and so with a noble Train of Lords and Ladies they sailed for <HI>Cyprus;</HI> where she was royally recei∣ved, and splendidly married: <HI>Andolocia</HI> making her Presents of very rich Jewels, and winning the chief Prize in the lusts: whereupon the Princess, as a Signal of her Favour, crowned him with a Garland of Triumph. This made many of the Nobles envy him, especially the Earls of <HI>Armandalia</HI> and <HI>Limehouse,</HI> vow'd his Death, who had so much eclips'd their Honour: and so setting on him, and his six Men, as he passed through a Wood, they, and their hundred Attendants after a long Fight, killing his Men, took him Prisoner, for he had not with him his Wishing cap, and casting him in a dark, and loathsome Dungeon, set him in the Stocks, and loaded him with Irons, to make him con∣fess whence he had those vast Riches: which thro' Torment, he disco∣ver'd, and gave them his Purse: which they having prov'd, thought 'em∣selves not safe whilst he was alive, because they knew he could go thro' the Air, and so might 'scape, and they having offer'd the Jalors Mony to dispatch him, and he refusing, the Earl <HI>Armandalia</HI> strangled him as he sat in the Stocks: And <HI>Ampedo</HI> having in vain sought for his Brother, and offer'd great Rewards for his Discovery, supposing him Dead, burnt his Wishing cap, and soon after (thro' Grief) dyed: at which time the Purse lost its Vertue, which made the Earls, who kept it by Turns, fall out, one charging the other to have changed it: and the Quarrel growing high, <HI>Limehouse</HI> call'd the other Murtherer, and let∣ing fall other Words, they were both apprehended, and being wrack∣ed, confessed the Fact: for which they were broke on the Wheel.</P>
