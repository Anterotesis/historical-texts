<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF THE High and Mighty States, the States Gene∣rall of the United Provinces; concerning the proclaiming of open Wars with England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the third of this instant Month, the great Assembly of the United Provinces met at the Hague, where there was a large Debate touching the proclaiming of open Wars with Eng∣land, otherwise to have restitution and satisfaction for all their ships and Goods taken: But after ma∣ture del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beration touching the apparent dangers that might thereby ensue, the States of Holland gave in their positive Result, declaring, That they were resolved (to the utmost of their power) to preserve
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>a firm League and Union with the States of Eng∣land; and to hold a fair correspondency for the in∣crease of free Trade and Commerce: Whereupon the States and Merchants of Zealand rose up in great fury, disolved the Assembly, and vowed re∣venge upon the English; but its thought the States General will be more prudent and wise then to hearken to the cryes or gruntling of the Bores; for here is a Proverb, That the Cries ot the Geese are never heard up to Heaven.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, the spirits of many thou∣sands are much exasperated, and great are the prepa∣rations which are making throughout the United Provinces; The Merchants of Zealand have sent 40 Commissioners to the States General, to treat with them about setting forth the Summers Fleet, and two hundred ships with Letters of Mart; so that they are again sat down in Councel, and its concei∣ved that at this Meeting, it will be resolved, to man out about 150 Men of War at the publike charge, besides what will be set forth by the Merchants, and Others, upon Letters of Mart, which (if things hold at this pass) our Governors that are well-affected to England, will be in evident danger of utter ruine.</P>
<P>For great are the Contests between the Burgo∣masters and the Bores; for the latter doth threaten to sequester their Estates, and bring them to a Tryall
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>for their lives, if they will not take a course to defend and assist them at Sea. And some Tumults and Ri∣sings have already been in Zealand, Rotterdam, Dort, Delf, and at the Hague, where many were both slain and wounded, and amongst the rest some English, which the Mutiniers chiefly aymed at, and brand them with the most infamous Badge of Tray∣tors and Conspirators to their Religion and Liber∣ties; which they are yet to chuse. And upon this Score, divers English Merchants are prohibited from coming upon the Exchange in Amsterdam, and o∣ther places. 200 Commissioners have bin sent to all the Frontier and Haven Towns, to see how many ships each Town can make ready in three weekes time: And having taken a List thereof, upon their return, caused the same to be printed; wherein ap∣pears the similitude of a great Armado, consisting of about 300 sayl of ships, Danes, Dutch, and Ham∣burgers: Besides they tatk of 200 more to be set forth upon Letters of Mart; but the truth is, they'l talk more by an inch of Candle in their liquor by Land, then they can perform by a whole pound, when they are in their Element at Sea. And although they build Castles in the Ayr, make their Accounts in Spain, and resolve to cast them up in England, by blocking up Dover, Sandwitch, Deal, and other Ports; yet I believe in God, and refer you to the in∣closed.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P> From Ireland we hear that the Enemy have uni∣ted their Forces, and have had a conjunction with with the Earl of Clanrickard, whose design was to have raisede the siege at Gallaway; but Sir Charles Coot having received intelligence thereof, drew off a party of Horse and Foot, and intercepted them in their passage, which the Enemy perceiving, betook themselves to flight, and in great disorder exposed themselves to several Passes; but most of them were intercepted, about 1500 slain upon the place, and 700 taken prisoners: Thus it pleased Divine Providence so to blast and maugre their de∣vices and stratagems, that of 4000, there escaped not above 1800; But in their Retreat they were met withall by Col. Sanchy, who charged them, and after a sharp dispute, routed them, killed many, and took divers prisoners; pursuing the rest as far as the Bog of Moneal, where taking advantage of the frost entred the Bog, stormed the strong Castle of Mon∣donall, and put all to the sword: After which great success, he marched to another strong Hold (three miles distant) called Dublin; which place contained 800 Houses, or Cabins; but he immediatly storm∣ed that also and killed 500 upon the place; In this gallant Attempt, the Colonel deported himself with a most magnanimous Spirit, being the first man that entred the Works; and the soldiers followed him
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>so close, that they soon became Masters of the Town, for which singular piece of service, he gave them the free plunder of the Town, which amount∣ed to a great value; as will appear by the List inclo∣sed.</P>
<P>The Enemy hath lately made a desperate salley out of Gallaway, and fell into our quarters, where they took a prey of neer 100 Cows, and 200 sheep; But it pleased the Lord as they returned, a party of Col. Russels rescued the prey, fought the Enemy, kill'd 60 of them, and took an Ensign, and divers o∣thers prisoners.</P>
<P>The Town hath held out a long time, expecting relief, but now they begin to hearken to a Treaty; and its believed that General Preston (their Governor) will desert them, (leaving them to make their own Terms and Conditions) and be take himself to a strong Iland of his in the Sea; and truly 'tis high time, for the souldiery begin to mutiny, and threaten to deliver him up to the mercy of the Parliament, in case he will not condescend to a Rendition of the Town.</P>
<P>But the Governor understanding the great distra∣ctions of the Souldiery, and perceiving that there was little hopes of Relief, thought it requisite to preserve himself by making an escape; and accord∣ingly attempting the Design, it proved effectual;
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>Since which time we hear, that the said town is surrendred, with all the Ordnance, Arms, Ammunition, Bag and Baggage: which if true, will prove a work very acceptable and advantagious, and much conducing to the interest of the Common-wealth of Eng∣land.</P>
<P>There are 15 Dutch Captains arrived here from the Barbadaes. who affirm, That the English turn'd them out of all their ships, only gave them a small Vessel to car∣ry them home; but were forced to sell the same to buy them provisions: This doth exceedingly inrage them, and they have vowed revenge either by Sea or Land.</P>
