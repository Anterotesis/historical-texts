<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Globe of the Earth in generall, and of the generall parts which it containeth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>OD Almighty, the great and wise Architect of the Universe, having by his Divine Power and Wisdome, raised out of Nothing this stately Fa∣brique of the World, and assigned unto all things their peculiar Place, Order, and Situ∣ation therein, as was most agreeable to their particular natures, operations, and properties; the Earth, being the grossest and most materiate of all created Substances, by the Creators eter∣nall Order and Decree, and its own naturall propensity, sunk into the lowest place of all Things, and that which was most distant from the Heavens, <HI>viz.</HI> into the Center or middle part of the World, becomming a Basis, as it were, and Foundation of support unto all o∣ther
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
elementary Substances or Bodies, as upon which either mediatly or immediatly they doe all rest and are sustained in their motions and operations; it self (speaking of the whole Bo∣dy or Mass of it) for ever immoveably resting upon its own weight, that is to say, upon the most naturall property of its own Substance; which being (as we see by experience in every particular part thereof) irresistably and direct∣ly <HI>to move downward,</HI> that is, from the Heavens, and toward the Center; it follows, that the Globe of the Earth being round (as both Scripture, Philosophie, and experience doe de∣monstrate it to be) it must needs follow, I say, that all and every the parts of this round Body, descending so naturally and irresistibly, as they doe, from all parts of the Circumference equally to the Center, that the whole Earth must naturally rest or stand immovable in the midst of the World, or in the middle part of the Circumference of the Heavens, neither mo∣ving nor inclining one way or other, in respect of the said Circumference or celestial Sphere; because, as 'tis evident, the inclination which any particular part of it may have, or be sup∣posed to have, to move this way or that: For example, North or South is equally resisted by some other part whose inclination is opposite,
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
and tends as naturally East and West. This the Scripture <HI>Psalm.</HI> 104, according to the origi∣nal, calleth the founding or establishing of the Earth <HI>upon its own Base,</HI> or as the common La∣tin translations read it <HI>super stabilitatem suam,</HI> meaning such a Foundation or Settlement as a∣riseth out of the Principles and natural Proper∣ties of its own Substance, &amp; not from any thing extrinsecal to it; and may be illustrated to sense by this familiar example: Let A, B, C, D, be
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the four quarters of a Circumference or Sphere, and E the Center or middle. Let there be four bullets, of paste or any other Sub∣stance, whose parts are apt to joyn and unite together into one figure. Let them be discharg∣ed at the same time from the four quarters of the Circumference, <HI>viz.</HI> from A, B, C, D, out
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
of four Cannons or Musquets, of equall bore and strength, directly, or in a right line to∣wards the Center, or E, where will they meet but exactly in or about E, the Center? and where will they rest but there likewise, in case that E, or the Center, be the naturall place of them, and that they have no intrinsecal princi∣ple and inclination in themselves to recede from thence? In like manner it is with the Earth. All the parts of it did, at the beginning and first creation of things by God, and still doe, naturally and directly tend, not onely from the four quarters, but from all and every imaginable part of the Circumference of the Heavens, to the Center or middle part of the World; and consequently their meeting (be∣cause it is their proper and naturall place, and from which they cannot of themselves, never so little, recede or decline) must there, and about it eternally rest: I say must there eter∣nally rest and remain setled or still, without motion or inclination to move one way or other, untill wee doe assigne some extrinse∣cal Agent or Cause, so much superior in force to their naturall inclination, as to be able to dislodg them and make them stir; which that it should be the <HI>levant windes,</HI> as some ima∣gine, truly seems to me a conceit lighter than
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
the winde, and much unworthy of the judge∣ment of him that, I think, first published it to the World: That such a soft and moderate gale, as those windes of themselves alwaies are, not sufficient to remove a stone of a pound weight, if it lay in their way, and many times not able to drive a Ship before it, with all the advantage of Sails, course of Waters, &amp;c. that can be given it: (for it is no strange thing at Sea, to heare that Ships are, now and then, be∣calmed, and want winde upon the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and within the Tropiques.) I say, that such a moderate gale, as those windes are, should be able to work such an effect against such an in∣finite resistance as is in the whole body of the Earth, what man of common sense can beleeve it?</P>
<P N="2">2. This therefore being a demonstration for the stability and unmovable fixedness of the Earth in the middle of the World, of such evident, obvious, and unrevincible experience as it is; Me thinks it cannot be sufficiently wondred at, why the World should seem so generally and so seriously to be taken with the Eccentrick and injudicious fancies of <HI>Coperni∣cus</HI> and <HI>Galilaeus,</HI> concerning the perpetual mo∣tion which they imagine to be in the Earth, and that the Heavens or celestial Bodies stand still
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
and move not at all. Fancies, not only contrary to common sense (so farre as sense may be judge of the motion, rest, distance, and situa∣tion of Bodies, which certainly it may and ought to be in many cases, and such as doe par∣ticularly pertain to this question) contrary to the more generall and unanimous judgement of both ancient and modern Philosophers, con∣trary to the evidence of so many thousand de∣monstrations Mathematicall and Astronomi∣call, which have been founded and held good in all ages, upon the contrary supposition, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Earth is the Center of the Universe; and that, <HI>secundum se totam,</HI> it never moveth; but contrary also unto Scripture, which refutes the opinion in a hundred places, reckoning the perpetuall motion of the Heavens, and the un∣movable rest and stability of the Earth, among the <HI>Magnalia Dei,</HI> or the chief works of Divine Providence and Wisdome. The places are so obvious and frequent, that it seems scarce ne∣cessary to alledge them; yet the reader, if he please, may see <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.5, 6. and 104.19, 20. <HI>Jos.</HI> 10.12, 13. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 20.9, 10, 11. <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.5. and 119.90. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 1.5. which last is the testimony of <HI>Solomon</HI> himself, not only a great King, but as the Scriptures likewise testify of him 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 4.29, 30, 31, 32, 33. a great Phi∣losopher,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
and one that understood the nature and constitution of the World better than any meere Philosopher before him, or since; which I suppose no man will be so immodest as to de∣ny. And though we acknowledge the Scrip∣tures were not given principally to teach us a body of Naturall Philosophy, as they frequent∣ly tell us; yet doubtless they were given to teach us truth, in whatsoever they teach us, and how to judge of the works of God, especially in those great and more generall parts of the Creation, which, by their obviousness and vi∣sibility, were to be the subject of every mans pious meditation and wonder: Neither can we but presume, with some confidence, that the Author of Scripture understood the frame and constitution of his own handiwork somewhat better than <HI>Copernicus</HI> or <HI>Des Cartes;</HI> and would, without all doubt, have made another manner of report of it, if the truth had been otherwise, or that it had been his divine plea∣sure, that we should have otherwise judged of it. Admit therefore, that the Scripture <HI>some∣times</HI> doth not speak so exactly of the Natures of things, but <HI>more hominum,</HI> as they say, and by way of <HI>accomodation,</HI> or fitting it self to the common judgment and apprehension of men, and consequently that it ought not to be al∣ledged
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
in questions <HI>purely philosophicall,</HI> con∣trary to the evidence of naturall reason and demonstration; yet certainly, where the testi∣mony of Scripture is so frequent and empha∣tically assertive, as it is in many respects here, and when the stile thereof is not contrary unto, but consonant to the generall properties and principles of Nature (by which even philoso∣phically we are to judge, and in other cases perpetually doe judge of Naturall things) if then we vouchsafe not both to speak and think according to the language of Scripture, we seem to bear but little respect to Scripture; and though the <HI>sense</HI> and <HI>stile</HI> of a writing be not al∣waies the one and same thing, yet in such case it must not be every plausible imagination or phantasm that may possibly com in our mindes, but very necessary, cogent, and undeniable de∣monstration indeed, that should induce us to dogmatize in any thing contrary to the autho∣rity of the sacred stile. But who ever saw any thing alledged by the Cartesians of this na∣ture? What necessary, cleer, and evident de∣monstrations doe they propound, either against the motion of the Heavens, or for the motion of the Earth? what objections doe they make, but learned men of the contrary opinion, doe as easily demonstrate to be fallacious and so∣phisticall,
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
and more easily answer than they seem to make them? Nay, for my part, 'tis more than I can yet observe, that they doe much pretend unto any such matter, <HI>viz.</HI> as to demonstrate either the <HI>necessity</HI> of their own system of the World, or the <HI>impossibility</HI> and inconsistency of the Ptolemaick or common System, with the principles of Nature and Reason▪ All that they labour about is rather to shew the possibility of their own devise, and to reconcile the <HI>Phoenomena</HI> or apparences of Heaven, and make them consistent wirh the motion of the Earth: which though they were better able to doe, then I suppose they are, yet would it not follow, but that the other is like∣wise as possible and consistent; and having the advantage of divine testimony and attestation beside, consequently it would but little justify some of them to dogmatize so freely in the point as they doe, contrary to the stile of sacred Scripture, and likewise to the judgement of some Ecclesiastical authority, that ought not to be slighted, before which <HI>Galilaeus</HI> himself was twice convinced of his error, and twice re∣canted his opinion. See <HI>Spondan. ad ann. Dom.</HI> 1633. <HI>sect.</HI> 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. I confess the opinion of some English∣men, <HI>viz. Carpenter</HI> in his Geographie, which
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
susteineth onely the circular and diurnal moti∣on of the Earth upon its own Axis and Center, is much less absurd than that of <HI>Copernicus</HI> and his gang: for it supposeth onely one uniform moti∣on in that body; and if it could salve the <HI>Phoeno∣mena</HI> abovesaid &amp; there could be any sufficient reason or cause assigned of such motion superi∣or and prevalent, as it must be, unto that natu∣rall resistance which is in the body of the Earth, unto such motion, as hath been said, I should readily enough assent to it; but am very confi∣dent, neither the one nor the other can be af∣firmed with truth. Whereas the opinion of <HI>Co∣pernicus,</HI> That the Sun is the Center of the Uni∣verse; that it standeth alwais still; and that the Earth, like a Planet, moveth about him circu∣larly betwixt the orbes, or Planetary circles of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> is lyable to infinite absur∣dities, contrary not only to the authority of sa∣cred Scripture, but of common sense, common reason, and the naturall condition and pro∣pensity of the Earth it self. For first it maketh that Body, which of it self is most unweldy, as I may say, and unapt for motion, and most na∣turally disposed to rest, the subject of the most rapid and accelerated motion, which they will acknowledge in the whole Universe, and this without assigning any proportionate and rea∣sonable
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
cause thereof. It is very well known, that one of the chiefest reasons (I know not well whither I may not say <HI>the onely reason</HI>) w<SUP>ch</SUP> they pretend against the motion of the Heavens is this, That the revolution of the superior Orbes, especially of the <HI>primum mobile,</HI> must necessarily be more swift than can be supposed in any naturall Body; which, though it seems a very childish and weak conceit, considering the nature of those Bodies, and their aptitude to move; and likewise what power it is that first gave them, and still continues the impressi∣on to it: yet against themselves it concludes very well, <HI>viz.</HI> that they ought not to assigne the same motion (I mean in proportion <HI>the same</HI>) unto another Body in no proportion capable of it, at least not without assigning a more ne∣cessary and evident cause of it than that of the Windes. But men are come to a great height of confidence in their assertions, it seems now adayes, and may well be pardoned such a petty oversight as this, when they blush not to su∣stain, deliberatly and soberly as a man would think, that the least weight whatsoever, is able to overpoise the Earth, and that if but a Flie out of the aire lights upon it, the whole Ma∣chine or Body of it shuggs, as it were: I mean, that it is <HI>really moved therewith,</HI> and that some

<HI>reall alteration</HI> is made in the site and position thereof, as to the other parts of the World. They that have the confidence to publish such Theorems as these to the World, I confess, may be permitted to say, the Windes, or any thing else lighter than the winde, are a sufficient cause, that the Earth circulates or turneth round once every day. Secondly, Because it makes one and the same continuate Body subject to so many different and contrary motions, at the same time: As first a diurnal motion upon its own Axis. Secondly, an annual motion, where∣by it describes and correspondeth to the Signes of the Zodiack. And lastly a motion, which they call, of Declination, quite contrary to that upon the Center, or the motion of the Uni∣verse, and whereby the whole Axis or Diame∣ter of the Earth is made to be movable, and not fixed. Absurdities, which in the motion of the Heavens, they know well enough, are easily salved by the supposition of Epicycles or lesser Orbes moving within the compass of the grea∣ter: which being, as is supposed, discontinuate from the greater Orbe, under which they move, though carryed about with it by force of the diurnall revolution, yet may well be con∣ceived to retain some peculiar motion of their own, different from that of the greater Orbe;
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
just as a Flie or a Snaile upon a wheel, may be supposed to be whirled about with the wheel from East to West; and yet, at the same time, by a peculiar motion of its own, creep slowly on, quite contrary to the motion of the wheel, <HI>viz.</HI> from West to East, or otherwise oblique∣ly and traverse the wheel, <HI>viz.</HI> from North to South. And being also neither concentrical with the superior orbe, under which they move, nor with the Earth, but eccentricall and moving upon a different Axis and Center from them, it must needs follow, that the Planets or other Stars assigned to such Orbs, and carried about by and with those Orbs in a motion retro∣grade and different from that of the superior, should at different times, that is, at different periods or points of their revolution, appear diversly posited, in respect of the Earth, and of us that live upon it; I mean sometimes more distant and remote, sometimes neerer at hand; somtimes more verticall, and somtimes more declining; according, I say, as the Planet or Star is carried either to his <HI>Augis</HI> or highest point of exaltation in the Epicycle; or con∣trariwise to his <HI>Absis,</HI> or depression: and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kewise according as either the condition of the Climate or the several seasons of the year, or some other provident intent of the wise

And though the Cartesians reject these Epicycles never so much, as fictitiou and imaginary things, yet can it not be denyed, but that they are possible, and their supposition not contrary, but agreeable enough unto Na∣ture and the quality of the Heavens. I say they are <HI>possible;</HI> which is more than can be said of many of their suppositions. And whosoever shall seriously consider, in other parts of the Universe, how much it pleaseth the Divine Wisdome, by the contrarietie and inequality that is in particulars, to ballance, as it were, and bear up the generall Harmony, Equality, and Concord of the whole, may in time perhaps, come to think them neither so improba∣ble.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Earth, which, by wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t hath been said in the be∣ginning and many other sensible demonstrati∣ons, doth necessarily place and settle it in the Center and middle space of the World. For, (not to repeat any thing that hath been spoken already) what other reason can be given, why a man, standing in any part of the Horizon, six of the Signes of the Zodiack will be seen of him, and the other six alwaies hid, but that the Earth is exactly, and at all times, in the mid'st of the World, or of the circumference of the Heavens? what reason can be given, why the Starrs appear alwaies of the same magnitude (if the aire be clear and equally disposed at the times of observation) whether in the verticall point or at East, West, or in whatsoever part of the Heavens they be observed, but that the parts of the Earth at all times keep the same distance from Heaven? what reason can be gi∣ven, why that whensoever the two great Lights, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sun and Moon, are diametrally oppo∣sed one to another in the Heavens, that is, the one full North, the other full South, or the one full East, the other full West, there alwaies happens an Eclypse of the Moon? and why the Moon never happens to be Eclypsed, but when she is so opposite to the Sun, but only be∣cause the Earth is perpetually in the midst of
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
the World, and by consequence in such oppo∣sition necessarily prohibits and hinders the re∣flexion of the Suns-light upon the Moon? I have no intention to enter a controversie with any man, much less to pretend an exact refuta∣tion of their opinion, how erroneous soever. What I have spoken hitherto hath been only <HI>obiter,</HI> and by way of preamble to the discourse that followeth; wherein, being to treat of such a considerable and rich part of the World as <HI>A∣merica</HI> is, unknown to former ages, and to make report of some part of the great wealth and riches which divine Providence had, as it were, treasured and laid up therein, to be dispensed unto other parts of the World in his appoin∣ted time; I thought it not improper nor much amiss, by way of Introduction, to take notice of a dispute so neerly concerning the principall subject of my discours, which is the Earth, or habitable World, and to speak my minde freely therein. How necessary is it, and how much could I wish, for the respects I bear to some Persons in the world, that men professing Re∣ligion and due reverence to the sacred Writt, would oftentimes remember one excellent do∣cument and advise therein, recorded by the Pen of that great Apostle and Doctor of the <HI>Gentils St. Paul,</HI> which is <HI>sapere ad sobrietatem,</HI> to use
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
our Learning and all acquired Endowments soberly and with due respect unto the dictates of Religion; knowing this, that the minde of man is otherwise, of it self, an abyss of inordi∣nate and irregular cogitations, to which, if we our selves set not bounds many times, by re∣ligious and voluntary acquiescence in such verities as divine Authority any way com∣mends unto us, but follow the swing of na∣turall curiosity, and our fine pleasing specula∣tions to the utmost, we may in time come to dispute our selves out of the right way, and be more apt to beleeve any thing, than what is good and true.</P>
<P N="5">5. That which compleateth the Globe, and maketh the body of the Earth more entirely round, is the Element of Waters; which is a Substance compounded, as it were, and consi∣sting of Earth and Aire mixed together, yet in such a proportion, as that the Substance of the Earth doth much predominate in the compo∣sition. From hence it followeth, that the ele∣ment of Water must retain the naturall pro∣pertie of the Earth, which is, to <HI>move down∣ward</HI> in a direct line toward the Center of the World, as we see perpetually that it doth in every little drop of water, which divides the Aire, and makes it self a direct passage through
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
it towards the Earth and Center of the World; and likewise it must retain (though in a weaker and lesser degree) the propertie of the Aire, which is to be diffufive and perpetually sprea∣ding it self, and unapt to be kept together but by some extrinsecal boundary or body that contains it. From the first of these, <HI>viz.</HI> the predominancy and propertie of the Earth in the Element of Water, it follows that the Wa∣ter must naturally cleave to the Earth, be na∣turally united with it, and hardly, that is, not otherwise than by force separated from it. So that there is no feare that the waters of the lower Hermi-sphere, or of the Antipodes, should fall back into the concave of the Hea∣vens, as, upon our first thoughts of it, we are commonly apt to imagine; nor yet that any of the People or other living Creatures in that part of the World, should have the like mis∣chance. For, upon whatsoever part of the <HI>Su∣perficies</HI> or Surface of the Earth they live and move, they are fastened and glued, as I may say, to it by this natural &amp; inbred propertie of the Earth, which is predominant in their constituti∣on, <HI>viz.</HI> to move downward, and incline to the Center, and which we see perpetually takes place in them, whensoever their animal and vo∣luntary motions cease. From the second, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
its natural fluxilitie and diffusiveness it fol∣lows, that the water must be apt to insinuate and lodg it self in all such cavities and recep∣tacles, whether upon the Surface or more within the bowels of the Earth, as the divine Providence hath prepared for it: and also that wheresoever it findeth a free passage, or chan∣nel, and that it is not stopt or kept in with banks or bounds, it should be naturally and continually flowing or in motion, as the Aire is: And from both it appears, how apt the wa∣ter of it self is to imbrace the Earth on all parts, and to constitute one common Globe or round Body with it. The Cartesians, men of such discerning and searching capacities as they are, me thinks, if they would, might more ea∣sily finde some probable reason from hence, of that notable effect in Nature, which hath so long exercised their Speculations, <HI>viz.</HI> of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, without being driven to a necessity of unsetling and shaking the foundation of all things, which the wisdom of God hath so cleerely laid in and upon the Earth; and without perverting the glorious and never sufficiently to be admired System and Frame of the World, with such presumption as they doe. Without doubt the influence of the celestial Bodies doe much concur to this
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
effect, by their attenuating and rarefying the substance of that Element; and likewise the Windes, especially those which are natural and constant to the respective Climates of the World: Nor doe I think it an effect, that can be attributed unto any particular, uniform, or single cause whatsoever; so as they that stretch their wits, and labor to attribute it to any such cause, I fear labour in vain. But yet, under fa∣vour, and with submission to better judge∣ment, I suppose the principal and more gene∣ral cause, which disposeth the element of the Waters to such an effect, may be that very thing or quality which we are now discoursing upon, <HI>viz.</HI> its natural fluxility and aptness to be perpetually running and in motion, where it hath a convenient channel wherein to flow, and wherby to empty it self into another place. For, as we said, naturally it is inconsistent in or with it self alone; nor is there any other cause required to make it move or flow, but onely a way open and plain: So that if it were certain (as I think most Cosmographers hold it for very probable) that there were a channel at the North for the waters of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or the western Ocean, to pass into the Atlan∣tick, as there is at the South for the waters of the Atlantick to pass into <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> I
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
should think without any more adoe, that what we call the Tyde, that is, the excrescency of the waters in narrow Seas, Creeks and Rivers nigh the Sea (for in the main Ocean 'tis com∣monly said there is little or noe Tyde obser∣ved) were nothing else but an effect of that great and general flood, by which the waters of one Hemisphere doe continually flow in∣to the other, according to the course and mo∣tion of the superior World, from which, be∣side their natural proclivity and aptness unto motion they doe constantly receive an accesso∣ry influence and impression to move; and which general flood, or course of the Waters out of one Hemisphere into another, as it pas∣seth along the several coasts of the World, ne∣cessarily putteth in aboundance of waters into all narrow Seas, Creeks, and other receptacles lying conveniently to receive it: and that the Ebbe is nothing else but the recess of the same Waters, retiring and withdrawing themselves (as they must necessarily doe) to follow the general flood, when it is gone by. But because this passage or entercourse of the Waters of the upper and lower Hemisphere, by the North, is not to me so evident, I leave the whole matter as a Problem, and Subject of further meditation to those that are willing to
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
think upon and study the great works of divine Providence with modesty and religious sobrie∣ty: not doubting, but that sufficient reason may be found otherwise of this admirable effect, from the natural property and inclinati∣on of the Water (as hath been said) to be al∣waies moving and flowing one way or other; from its aptitude likewise to receive impulsion, or an impression to move from all other things; from the natural site and position of the parts of the Earth, in the several quarters of the World, by which it floweth; and from diverse other causes, that possibly might be observed, if we did apply our selves to take notice of them as we ought.</P>
<P N="6">6. The general Globe, or whole body of the Earths circumference, is divided by the Equinoctial line, into two great and equall Hemispheres, or half parts, which they call the upper and lower Hemisphere; and sometimes the Northern and Southern, because they lie upon the North and South side of the line that runneth betwixt them and divides them one from another: And by the Meridian (com∣monly caled the Meridian of the World) into two other, which they call the Eastern and the Western for the same reason. It containeth four general quarters, or known habitable

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>America</HI> in particular, and of its first dis∣covery by <HI>Christopher Columbus, Americus Vespucius,</HI> and others.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. I Shal not detain the Reader with any long dispute, whether this great part of the World, which we call <HI>America,</HI> were known to the Ancients, or not; seeing the an∣cient Geographers, as <HI>Ptolomy, Strabo,</HI> and others, make no mention of it in their Books: This is certain, that if ever there were any knowledge of it, as some suppose there might be, and that particularly in the dayes of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> yet through an absolute discontinu∣ance of Traffique and Commerce betwixt
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
those Parts and such other Nations of the world▪ as have left us any reports, or history of former times, that knowledg was long since so utterly extinct and forgotten, as if it had never been. As for the Text of Scripture, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 3 6. which is sometimes alledged, where the Gold, which King <HI>Solomon</HI> used a∣bout the Temple, is said to be <HI>Gold of Parvaim,</HI> and which the favourers of the affirmative opi∣nion, interpret of the Country of <HI>Peru</HI> in <HI>America:</HI> though some learned men insist upon it, yet to others it seems rather a plausible conjecture, than a good argument; and who∣soever considers how unlikely it is, that a Country once famously known and sought af∣ter upon such an occasion, should ever come to be unknown, and, as it were, lost in the world: or that Commerce and Traffique, once held and setled between Nations, upon a com∣modity so much esteemed and desired by all men, as gold is, should ever come to be totally discontinued with all Nations, and to suffer a lapse beyond all memory of men and ages; I say, whosoever considers this, I think in reason he should acknowledge, that the negative opi∣nion is more probable; and that we doe but right to the memorie of <HI>Columbus,</HI> and those other brave men, his followers, still to account
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
them the first discoverers of this <HI>new World,</HI> as 'tis commonly called; and in that quality to speak a few words of them, before we proceed any further.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> was by Nation an Italian, born, as it is said, at <HI>Nervi</HI> in the terri∣tory of the Common-wealth of <HI>Genoa;</HI> who ha∣ving by his education and long practise at Sea, attained to a great skill in the Art of Navigati∣on, and in all Maritim affairs, was at this time become famous and well accepted, by reason of his good abilities, to most of the Princes of Christendome; being well known in the Courts of <HI>England, Spain, Portugall,</HI> and o∣thers; and being also a good Mathematician, by observing the daily course of the Sunne, came at last to a resolution with himself, that there must needs be yet some other World, unknown to us, to whom that glori∣ous Planet dispensed the benefit of his raies, during his absence from our Hemispheare: be∣ing likewise surprised with an intense desire of discovering that presumed World, and of searching out where it lay, and what kinde of People it had. The French are not willing that the glorie of this enterprise should be so intirely attributed to <HI>Columbus; Thuanus,</HI> a grave &amp; good Author positively affirming, that
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>
<HI>Mounsieur Betoncourt,</HI> a French-man, who first discovered the <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> Islands, as they call them, and afterwards sold them to the Spaniards, gave him some information of the Country, and did little less than put him upon the designe. Others speak of a certain Pilot, who had been wrackt upon some of the very Coasts of <HI>America,</HI> with whom <HI>Columbus</HI> had the good fortune to be acquainted, and to learn much from him: That <HI>Martin Vincent,</HI> his Brother in Law by the marriage of his Wifes Sister (being himself also a man much used to the Sea) had assured him, that he was once by a storm, carried more then 450 de∣grees westward of the Cape of <HI>St. Vincent</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Africk,</HI> and that he there met with certain great loggs or pieces of Tim∣ber floating upon the Sea, such as he could not but beleeve were driven thither from some western Country or Islands, lying further into the Main. That the Inhabitants of the <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> Islands, had told him, that upon the Coasts of <HI>Gracyosa, Fayal,</HI> and <HI>Flores</HI> Islands, there had been lately cast certain Pine trees of <HI>India,</HI> and certain dead men, of coun∣tenance and stature much differing from the proportion of any other known Nations; and likewise certain weather-driven Canoes or
<PB N="27" REF="23"/>
little Boats, which they knew were used by none but Indians, or by some other unknown remote Nations, which must lye westward of them. All which, whether it were true or false, matters not much: For whatsoever the first inducements and encouragements were, which <HI>Columbus</HI> had towards the enterprise, 'tis cer∣tain, he was the first that propounded it to the Christian World, and prosecuted his proposi∣tion with such a constancy and magnanimous resolution, notwithstanding the many difficul∣ties and oppositions which for a long time he met with, as may easily argue somthing more than the hand or counsel of man in the busi∣ness, both supporting and conducting him in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. For not being able out of his private for∣tunes to furnish himself out upon such a design, he was forced to have recourse to certain Chri∣stian Princes and States, and to desire their assi∣stance: some of w<SUP>ch</SUP> rejected his propositions as ridiculous and vain; to wit, the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> to whom, as being his native Country, he first applyed himself. In the Court of <HI>Portugall,</HI> where he had married a wife, and by that means was become free Denizen and a Sub∣ject of that Crown, he was maligned and hin∣dred of his purpose out of envy, by some of
<PB N="28" REF="24"/>
the Councell very powerfull with that King: who although they would not seem to regard his proposition, yet privately &amp; under pretence of a voyage onely to <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> themselves sent out a Carvell, with instructions to make what discoveries they could of any Land west∣ward. But their project had no great success; the Carvell after much fowl weather and hard∣ship endured, making a difficult return home, and discovering nothing. Whereupon he ap∣plyeth himself to the King of <HI>England,</HI> who was at that time <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, a Prince that loved treasure well enough, but cared not to hazard much to gain it: and all that <HI>Co∣lumbus</HI> could promise as yet upon that point was onely, that he would discover a shorter way to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> whereby Christian Princes might procure themselves the wealth of those rich Countries already known, in a shorter time, and at far less charges than hi∣therto they had been able to doe. But what through the parcimony of this Prince, and his cold attention to the business when it was first propounded to him; and what through the misfortunes which his Brother <HI>Bartholmew Columbus,</HI> met withall in his way to <HI>England,</HI> which somewhat hindred his addresses to the King, there was no answer given, till it was too
<PB N="29" REF="24"/>
late, and that <HI>Columbus</HI> had engaged his ser∣vice unto <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Castile;</HI> who at last, <HI>viz.</HI> after a matter of six or seven years attendance and delayes, had yeilded to his re∣quest, at the earnest entreaty of the Queen <HI>Isabella,</HI> and of the Cardinal <HI>Mendoza</HI> Arch∣bishop of <HI>Toledo.</HI> It is said, that the Queen was become so zealous and earnestly affected to the business, as 'tis supposed, upon some principles of Religion, suggested to her by a Religious man, <HI>Fernando de Talovera</HI> her Con∣fessor, that she pawned many of hir own Jew∣els to help to furnish him out: and 'tis certain, the Treasure of <HI>Castile</HI> was never more exhau∣sted, than it was at that time, through a long and chargeable warre with the Moors, which was not quite ended when <HI>Columbus</HI> received his Commission: So that many humane rea∣sons might seem to have excused that King from undertaking any new charge, at that time especially, had it not been the will of divine Providence to have that work goe forward, and to recompense the liberality and piety of those Princes with such an infinite advantage both of wealth and honour, by the means of this man.</P>
<P N="4">4. On Friday the third of <HI>August</HI> 1492, he set out from <HI>Palos,</HI> a Port Town of <HI>Andalusia,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="25"/>
with three Carvels, whereof the Admirall <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> was commanded by himself; the Vice-Admirall <HI>Pinta,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Martin Pincon;</HI> and the <HI>Ninna,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Vincent Yannez, Pin∣eon,</HI> having aboard in all of them together about 120 men, and among them <HI>Americus Vespucius</HI> for one. On the eleventh of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> following they had sight of the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands, and sailing forwards, on the 16<SUP>th</SUP> day they met with certain quantities of long grass floating upon the water, and upon one of them a Gras-hopper alive; which grass, as it en∣creased daily more and more for some time, so it put them in continual hopes every day of coming to some Land. Nevertheless they sail∣ed <HI>August</HI> quite out, the whole Moneth of <HI>September</HI> following, and some part of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> without kenning of any land; which trou∣bled them extreamly; insomuch that his com∣pany began to mutiny desperately, and to threaten their Admiral, that they would throw him overboard, unless he would presently re∣turn for <HI>Spain;</HI> swearing <HI>they were abus'd,</HI> and <HI>that he should not make himself a great Lord, as he intended, with the perill of their lives.</HI> They alledged moreover, that the Ships were spent and grown so leaky, that they thought they
<PB N="31" REF="25"/>
would scarce endure the Seas so long, as to carry them safely home again. <HI>Columbus</HI> was much afflicted with this behaviour and resolu∣tion of his Souldiers, yet endeavored to pacify and draw them on, as much as he could, with good words, and to animate them still with hopes of success: but at length, seeing nothing else could prevail with them, much against his will, he made them a promise, that if within three dayes they descryed not Land, he would forthwith return for <HI>Spain.</HI> This was on the 10<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October;</HI> and the very night following they discovered the Island <HI>Guanahani,</HI> one of the <HI>Leucaiae</HI> Islands, which lye together in the Gulfe of <HI>America,</HI> called afterwards by <HI>Co∣lumbus St. Salvador.</HI> This was a great rejoy∣cing to them all, especially to <HI>Columbus,</HI> who went on shore; and having sung the <HI>Te Deum</HI> on his knees, with tears in his eyes, he erected a Cross and took possession of the Island in the name of the Catholique Kings <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella,</HI> all the Spaniards that were with him presently (according to his Patent) acknow∣ledging him Viceroy of the Countrie. There were standing by some few of the Natives, wondring to see men cloathed and so acoutred as the Spaniards were, themselves being for the most part naked, and onely painted upon their
<PB N="32" REF="26"/>
bodies, with white, black, red, and other co∣lours as their fancie lead them. In their no∣strils and upon their lips some of them had rings of gold pendant, as it were, in the way of ornament; which the Spaniards quickly espied: and inquiring of them by signes, where they had such fine things, they came to under∣stand, that a certain King of that Country, who lived a great way further toward the South, had aboundance of it. This news pleased them so well, that they made no long stay there, but on the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October</HI> they set Sail, and fell upon another of those Islands seven or eight leagues distant from this, which they called <HI>la Conception;</HI> from thence upon the 17<SUP>th</SUP> they came to the Island <HI>Fernandina;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cuba: Columbus</HI> not suffering his men in any of these places, to take ought from the Natives against their will, or without gi∣ving them something for it, which they seemed to desire. At <HI>Cuba</HI> he found that the Natives had some Towns and Villages, which they in∣habited, and were so ordered, that in fifty or threescore houses sometimes 2000 or 1500 people of Men, Women, and Children, were contained, according to the custome of the Country, that all People of the same Linage or Kindred lived together in one house: and their
<PB N="33" REF="26"/>
houses being built square, in the fashion of a Court, with long and large sides, though but low and of a lamentable Architecture, easily contained them all.</P>
<P N="5">5. From hence they sailed to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where they had sight of the King of the Coun∣try, named <HI>Guacanagari,</HI> who received him and his company with much shew of kinde∣ness, presenting him with the Fruits and other Commodities of the Country; and, which was better than all the rest, giving them more cer∣tain information of those golden Provinces, which were afterwards discovered in the main Land; for as yet they were but upon Islands, and had not touched or seen any part of the Continent of <HI>America. Columbus</HI> was so well satisfied with the intelligence which he had gained, that he resolved to return for <HI>Spain,</HI> and to make report of his Adventures to the King; whereunto the condition of his Ships, want of some necessary Provisions to proceed further, together with some other accidents, did also induce him. For, as it commonly hap∣pens in the affairs of this World, unanimity and friendship lasteth not long among men, especially where self-love and private interest once make a breach, his Vice-Admiral <HI>Pincon,</HI> perceiving the voyage likely to be profitable,
<PB N="34" REF="27"/>
had by this time separated himself from <HI>Co∣lumbus,</HI> upon pretence of some offence taken, but really out of hopes to advance his Fortunes better by going apart by himself; which, though it were derogatorie to his Commission and the command which he had over him, as Admirall, yet <HI>Columbus</HI> was content to beare with it, for the better carrying on of their com∣mon design; so they were reconciled: And having built the Fort of <HI>Natividad</HI> in <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI> for the guard of some Spaniards that were to be left there, <HI>Columbus</HI> set sail for <HI>Spain</HI> on Friday the fourth of <HI>January,</HI> having first charged his men to shew all due respect to the King of the Country, and not to wrong the Natives. But how they did observe his charge, doth not so well appear; For the men are said to be murder'd, all of them, by the Na∣tives, during the absence of <HI>Columbus:</HI> and this is thought to have been some occasion, not onely of the Warre, which the Spaniards made afterwards upon the Natives, but of that ex∣cessive severity and cruelty, which for a long time together they used towards them. In his return he discovered a great part more of the coasts of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and gave names to diverse Capes and Harbors, by which he passed: But drawing neer home, he suffered two such ter∣rible
<PB N="35" REF="27"/>
storms, upon the coasts of <HI>Spain,</HI> as had well nigh buried him and all his hopes in the bottome of the Sea. By reason whereof, and for the performance of some vows, which he had made in his distress, he went on Land, upon some part of the Kingdom of <HI>Portugall;</HI> which he thought he might safely doe: But it proved otherwise. For the fame of his voyage being blown home before him, there was in the Court of <HI>Portugall</HI> no little matter of offence conceived against him, That he, being a Sub∣ject of that Crown (as we have said he was by the right of his Wife) should doe such an emi∣nent service, without leave, to a forraign Prince, and one that perhaps, was little better than an Enemy. This was chiefly through the instigation of some malevolent persons about the King: and although the suggestion were altogether injurious and groundless, <HI>Columbus</HI> having first offered his service to that King, and been refused, yet it prevailed so farre, that <HI>Co∣lumbus</HI> was apprehended and sent up to <HI>Lis∣bon.</HI> But the King himself seeing him, contra∣ry to the expectation and endeavours of some about him, used him with much respect and kindness; and after some short time, having had that discourse with him, concerning his voyage and adventures, that he desired, he let
<PB N="36" REF="28"/>
him freely pass to the Court of <HI>Castile.</HI> Where he was received with a welcome answerable to the success of his endeavours, and to the ad∣vantage which they promised that Crown; and quickly furnished out again with more and better Ships, wherein he made several and suc∣cessfull voyages, still discovering more and more of this new World which he had found, and asserting the several Provinces where he came, to the Crown of <HI>Castile.</HI> And although towards his latter end, through the procure∣ment of some enemies which he had at Court, whose envy, like a dark shadow, perpetually attended the lustre of his brave actions, he suf∣fered some Eclypse for a time in his honour and reputation, upon occasion of a Rebellion, which one <HI>Roldanio Ximenez,</HI> a seditious tur∣bulent fellow, and one that had been once his Servant, and advanced by him, had begun to raise in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> and that <HI>Bobadilla</HI> was sent to be Governor of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> in his stead: yet being come to Court, though in quality of a Prisoner, and, as some say, in chains, the re∣membrance and sense of his former merits, to∣gether with his own approved honestie and vertue, soon dissipated those clowds of jealou∣sie and suspicion, which were gathered against him; and the Catholique Kings look'd favo∣rably
<PB N="37" REF="28"/>
upon him, renewed and confirmed his former Authority and priviledges, <HI>viz.</HI> of Ad∣mirall of those Western Seas, (which Office his Sonne and Nephew after him a long time en∣joyed) created him Duke <HI>De la vega</HI> in the Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> being a Town which himself had built: So that he both lived and dyed with Honor; being a man, as 'tis credibly reported of him by diverse Authors, of exemplary Piety and Vertue; very religious and devout to∣wards God; just, affable, and courteous to∣wards Men; temperate and abstenious in all things; and in a word, such a man (as Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> truly acknowledgeth of him) as <HI>God had made a fit instrument for so great a work, viz.</HI> as was the discovery of so many great, rich, fertil, and fair Countries, as were former∣ly unknown to the Christian World; being no less celebrated by the Spanish Writers, <HI>Oviedo, Herrera,</HI> and others, for his magnanimity, courage, wisdome, and admirable resolution in his undertakings.</P>
<P N="6">6. Second to <HI>Columbus,</HI> in the glorie of this grand and successfull enterprise of disco∣vering the new World, was <HI>Americus Vespu∣cius,</HI> a Florentine; who especially in the ser∣vice at the charge of <HI>Emanuell,</HI> King of <HI>Por∣tugall,</HI> undertook the business. He had been
<PB N="38" REF="29"/>
one of <HI>Columbus</HI> his companions in the first expedition, and consequently did now but trace the way which <HI>Columbus</HI> had before shewed him; yet had he this happiness and honour above his Predecessor, <HI>viz.</HI> to give name unto the Country discovered; the whole Continent of the new World being ever since generally called <HI>America</HI> from him. This man, as was said, having made several voyages to <HI>America,</HI> partly with <HI>Columbus,</HI> and partly by himself, in the service of King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and by them discovered much of the Conti∣nent of <HI>America</HI> on this side the Equator, in the year 1502 <HI>Emanuell,</HI> King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> took him into his service. Under whom seting out of <HI>Lisbon</HI> with his companions, and a com∣petent number of Ships, they sailed up to the Equator; and having crossed the line, disco∣vered the coasts of <HI>Guiana</HI> and <HI>Brasil,</HI> beyond the Tropique of <HI>Capicorne</HI> to 32 degrees of Southern latitude; where having stayed some time, and taken possession of the Country af∣ter their usual formalities, they held on their course beyond the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> unto 52 degrees, as <HI>Munster</HI> in his Cosmographie re∣porteth; which is accounted to be full the height of the Streites. But here being taken w<SUP>th</SUP> foul weather, and their Ships much spent and
<PB N="39" REF="29"/>
impaired by the stormes, they were forced to retun homeward by the coast of <HI>Afrique.</HI> In the year following, <HI>viz.</HI> 1503, he attempted another voyage, directing his course for <HI>Mel∣cha</HI> or <HI>Insula Real,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Brasil;</HI> but having passed <HI>Cape Verde</HI> and <HI>Sierra Liona,</HI> upon the coast of <HI>Guinee,</HI> by a great misfor∣tune, the Ship which carried their chief Provi∣sions was sunk, and 300 Barrels or Hogs∣heads of Victuals and other necessary Provi∣sions for the company, was utterly lost: by which disaster being forced again to turn homeward, how long he lived, or what expe∣ditions he made after this, it doth not ap∣pear.</P>
<P N="7">7. I ought not altogether to forget Sir <HI>Se∣bastian Cabot,</HI> a Venetian Gentleman, yet born and living in <HI>England;</HI> who likewise about this time, <HI>viz.</HI> in the year 1496, at the charge of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, King of <HI>England,</HI> set out with two Carvels, for the discovery of a North-west passage to <HI>Cathay</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> according to the design which <HI>Colum∣bus</HI> had first suggested to him. In pursuit whereof, he is reported to have sailed to 67 degrees of Northern latitude upon the coast of <HI>America;</HI> but finding the Land still to bear Eastward, which was contrarie to his purpose,
<PB N="40" REF="30"/>
he turned sail and coasted down Southward as farre as <HI>Florida,</HI> where with the usual cere∣monies, he took possession of several places, in the name of the King of <HI>England,</HI> as we shall further see in the particular description of the Continent. In the way he discovered the Islands <HI>Baccaleos,</HI> or of Cod-fish; so na∣med from the great aboundance of that kinde of Fish which they met withall upon the coasts. They lie 25 leagues into the Sea over against <HI>Cape Raye</HI> of New-found land; where the English have an extraordinary good Trade for Fishing, and also many other rich Commodi∣ties. But being forced at length to return home again for want of Victuals, his business, by reason of Warres which we had then with <HI>Scotland,</HI> was wholly laid aside, to the great prejudice of the English Nation, who in all probability might have made themselves quar∣ter-Masters at least with the Spaniard in the wealthiest parts and Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> if the business had been well followed. Sir <HI>Se∣bastian</HI> himself went immediatly thereupon into <HI>Spain:</HI> and though he returned again into <HI>England,</HI> and was graced by the King with some titulary dignity, <HI>viz.</HI> of Grand Pilot of <HI>England,</HI> and a pension; yet seeing his design was never revived to effect, I shall forbear to
<PB N="41" REF="30"/>
speak further of him: as likewise I shall doe concerning <HI>Ferdinand Magellan</HI> a Portu∣ghese; whose name, although it be deservedly famous in the History and affairs of the new World, and that he had the happiness to dis∣cover what so many before him had sought, but could not finde, namely a passage to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> by the South Sea and the coast of <HI>America,</HI> called therefore from him ever since <HI>Megellans Streits:</HI> yet because his business chiefly was to discover, and not to conquer; and that his design upon the Continent failed, which was to have planted a Colonie of Spa∣niards in the middle and narrowest part of the Streits, thereby to have secured the Streits to himselfe, and prohibited the passage to all Strangers, it may suffice to remember him in some other place, that is, in the description of that part of the Continent which lyeth upon those Streits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Voyage to <HI>America;</HI> or the ordinary course of Navigation, which the Spaniards commonly hold, to and from the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe English Nation have long since bin acquainted with the waies to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> reasonably well, as appears by the many brave exploits gallantly attempted, and no less stoutly and successfully performed by them in those parts, both at Sea and Land; some of which I shall not altogether forget to mention in due place. So that this Chapter may seem not so necessarie. Nevertheless for the satisfaction of those, who are never likely to see <HI>America</HI> otherwise then in a Map; nor to understand the affairs of that rich part of the World, but by such reports and relations as this, I think it not altogether inconvenient to speak a few words of the particular voyage, or course held by Sea, to and from <HI>America,</HI> cal∣led by the Spaniards commonly <HI>Carrera de las Indias.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Their course is wholly Westward; and they reckon commonly from <HI>Sevill</HI> in <HI>Andalu∣zia,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="31"/>
which is a Province of old <HI>Spain</HI> to St. <HI>John D' vllua,</HI> a famous and much fre∣quented Port of the Province of <HI>New-Spain</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> about 1700 leagues, after the Spanish measure, which is thrice so much of Italian or common miles; and with favo∣rable windes they doe ordinarily dispatch it in two moneths and an half. To <HI>Nombre be bios,</HI> or <HI>Porto-bello,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> they reckon 1400 leagues, and doe usually make their voyage in two moneths. They set out commonly from <HI>St. Lucar,</HI> which is the Port, as it were, to <HI>Sevill;</HI> or else from <HI>Palos,</HI> a Sea Town in the same Province with <HI>Sevill,</HI> &amp; not many miles distant from St. <HI>Lucar,</HI> West∣ward; and hold their course directly for the <HI>Canaries,</HI> which are certain Islands towards the coasts of <HI>Africk,</HI> under the dominion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> well known for the rich Wines yearly transported thence. They lye about 200 leagues distant from <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Ships arrive at them commonly in eight or ten daies, if nothing hinder, making their course through the Bay or Gulf <HI>De las yeguas,</HI> as they call it, from the aboundance of Mares which they were transporting into <HI>America,</HI> and were forced thereabouts, by a storm, to cast over board. It is counted the most difficult
<PB N="44" REF="32"/>
passage betwixt <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> especially in the Winter-time, being then for the most part dangerously infested with vio∣lent and contrary windes. At these Islands the Spaniards ordinarily victuall and supply them∣selves with necessaries, the Countrie being rich and affording all things requisite for their journey plentifully, especially that called <HI>Pal∣ma,</HI> where they use most commonly to touch and furnish themselves. From hence they set sail for <HI>America,</HI> by the Islands of <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> which lye in the Atlantick Ocean, a few de∣grees within the Tropiques, toward the coast of <HI>Africk:</HI> And hither, for the most part, they have an easie and certain course, seldom wan∣ting some favorable winde or other to bring them within the Tropiques, or Torrid Zone, as 'tis commonly called: and being there, they have constant windes forward, which they call <HI>The Brises</HI> or Levant-windes. These are cer∣tain Easterly windes, which continually blow within the Tropiques, on both sides of the Equator, never failing; and in the space of fourteen or fifteen daies, doe carry the Ships within sight of the Northern Islands, as they at the <HI>West-Indies</HI> call them; which are, as it were the Suburbs of the New World, lying thick scattered upon the coast of
<PB N="45" REF="32"/>
<HI>America,</HI> in the Atlantick or North Sea.</P>
<P N="3">3. The first which they commonly disco∣ver, are some of the <HI>Caribee</HI> Ilands, lying to∣ward the coast of <HI>Paria, viz. Desseada, Domi∣nica, Guadalupe;</HI> at which last they alwaies come to Anchor, and refresh themselves both going and coming; and from hence disperse themselves to the several parts and Ports of <HI>America,</HI> for which they are bound. Those that goe for <HI>New-Spain,</HI> take the right hand way towards the Island <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> and ha∣ving discovered the Cape <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> which is a foreland or Promontorie, in the furthest and most Westerly parts of <HI>Cuba,</HI> they sail in sight of the Islands both of <HI>St. John de Port∣rico,</HI> and also of <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> of which last they leave the Port or Citty of St. <HI>Domingo</HI> at a distance of two or three leagues off at Sea, and hold their course betwixt the Islands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> till they attain St. <HI>John D' ullua,</HI> or <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> in the Province of <HI>New Spain.</HI> This passage, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Islands <HI>Desseada</HI> and <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> to <HI>St. John D'ullua</HI> is reckoned to be little less than 500 leagues; and by rea∣son of so many Islands, great and small, which lie in their way, and cause the Seas to be much subject to contrary windes, it is counted a pas∣sage of no little difficultie, and not to be at∣temped,
<PB N="46" REF="33"/>
as <HI>Herrera</HI> saith, without a very skil∣full Pilot, and that in the day time, with the fa∣vour of a good winde and a full Sea; in respect whereof they commonly make it twenty daies passage, and are glad if they can reach it with∣in that time. Those that goe for the Main Land, as they call it, or <HI>Castella del oro,</HI> have a passage of 400 leagues from <HI>Guadalupe</HI> above∣said. These take the left-hand way; and ha∣ving discovered the high Mountain of <HI>Tayrone,</HI> which is as a <HI>Pharos</HI> or generall Land-mark for such as sail upon that coast: they touch at <HI>Car∣thagena,</HI> a famous and well-seated Port and Citty of that Province; and from thence pass on to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> or <HI>Porto-Bello,</HI> from which places they convey all their Merchandise by Land unto <HI>Panama,</HI> which is not above eighteen or twenty miles distant, and lyeth upon the South Sea: where they are Shipt again; and from thence by Sea conveyed to all the parts of the Province of <HI>Peru.</HI> They that goe to <HI>Honduras</HI> and the Province of <HI>Guati∣mala,</HI> keep company with them that goe for <HI>New-Spain,</HI> till they discover Cape <HI>Tiburon,</HI> which is the first point of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> Westward, where they leave them, and run along upon the North-side of the Island <HI>Jamaica,</HI> unto the point of <HI>Negrillo:</HI> Then they put to Sea, and
<PB N="47" REF="33"/>
seek the Cape called <HI>Cameron,</HI> which is at the entrance of the gulf and Province of <HI>Honduras;</HI> from whence sailing fourteen or fifteen leagues Westward, they come to Anchor at <HI>Truxillo,</HI> upon the River <HI>Haguara,</HI> which run∣eth into the said Gulf, and unlade their Mer∣chandise, so much of it as is intended for those parts: the rest they carry further up the Gulf to <HI>Porto de Cavallos,</HI> or <HI>St. Thomas de Ca∣stile;</HI> and from thence along the coast into the Province of <HI>Guatimala.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The best and most usual time for an out∣ward voyage, that is from <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> is about the Spring, <HI>viz.</HI> from the latter end of <HI>March</HI> to the beginning of <HI>May;</HI> for then commonly they make their voyage in due time, and come well thither. If they stay longer, so as that the Moneth of <HI>August</HI> be spent before they reach the Islands, it is more difficult, and they are usually taken with the <HI>Hurricanos,</HI> as they call them, which are certain violent and contary windes that doe terribly infest the At∣lantick and Indian Seas all winter long, from <HI>September</HI> to <HI>March.</HI> And likewise in their return homewards they observe the same time of the yeere there, <HI>viz.</HI> about <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> the ships that are to return for <HI>Spayn,</HI> from all parts of the continent of <HI>America</HI> bend their
<PB N="48" REF="34"/>
course for <HI>Havana,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> which is the place of their general Rendez∣vous where they are all to meet, and to stay one for another till the whol Fleet, especially both of Convoy and Treasure be come in. Those from the main land, set sayle common∣ly in <HI>May</HI> from <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> laden with all the wealth of <HI>Peru,</HI> and whatsoever else comes by the south Sea, which is not seldome very much from the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands and the east <HI>Indies,</HI> and at <HI>Carthagina</HI> take in more, brought thi∣ther from all parts on that side the continent, especially out of the new kingdome of <HI>Grana∣da,</HI> as they call it. Sayling from <HI>Carthagena</HI> they avoid the coast of <HI>Veragua</HI> what they can, by reason that the Current, which falleth out of the Ocean into that Gulfe, cometh so strongly upon them, that they would never beare up against it, at least not without much difficulty and danger; So that they are for∣ced to seek the Cape Saint <HI>Anthony,</HI> which, as we said, was the most westerly point of the Island <HI>Cuba,</HI> at which place the ships from <HI>Honduras</HI> doe also touch, and so they sayle to∣gether a matter of fifty leagues eastward, till they come to <HI>Havana.</HI> The ships from new <HI>Spayne</HI> beare up Northward as far as the Sound or Bay called <HI>Las Tortugas,</HI> which are
<PB N="49" REF="34"/>
certain Islands lying upon the coast of <HI>Florida,</HI> and so fetch a compasse, as it were, of little lesse then three hundred leagues, before they come to <HI>Havana.</HI> The reason of this course is, because the American Seas, especially neere upon the coast, are frequently subject to calms, so as the ships oftentimes want winde to sayle with; and therefore to gain, or assure them∣selves as much as may be of a convenient wind, they are forced to steere thus far Northward; from whence, that is, from the Islands <HI>Tortu∣gas,</HI> they have a short and easie cut of a few leagues over to <HI>Havaena.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. When the ships are all met in the Port of <HI>Havana,</HI> they presently set sayle for <HI>Spayne</HI> through the Streites of <HI>Bahama,</HI> and by some of the <HI>Leucaiae</HI> Islands; not now in a direct course East-ward, as they came in from the East, but in a greater altitude and more Nor∣therly. The reason hereof is, because the Bri∣ses or Easterly winds, which, as we said, doe constantly blow all within the Tropiques, or Torrid zone, doe hinder their passage East-ward, and force them to seeke their course higher, that is, somewhere without the Tro∣piques and more towards the North, at least to twenty three or twenty foure degrees of al∣titude, where they finde Westerly windes com∣monly,
<PB N="50" REF="35"/>
which carry them homewards as far as the <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> Islands; and the far∣ther they goe from the Line, the more ordina∣ry and certain those windes are, and more fit to make their return; for as much as blowing from the South and south-west, they carry them directly East and North-east, as their voyage lyeth; which is also the reason why the return which the ships make from <HI>America,</HI> or any of those western Islands, is usually more difficult, longer and less certain than when they goe out; because, as hath been said, in their going out, when they are once passed the <HI>Canarie</HI> Islands and got within the Tro∣piques (which they usually doe in four or five dayes sayling, if the windes favor them) they have constantly there an Easterly winde, which carries them with full Sayles upon the Islands of <HI>America:</HI> whereas in their return, be∣side the uncertainty of the windes by which they sayle, they are forced to seeke a height, as they call it, that is, to fetch a compasse Northwards sometimes more then three or four hundred leagues to gaine a convenient winde. These <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> Islands lie in the Atlantick Ocean, betweene thirty seven and fourty degrees of northern Latitude, and are reckoned to be about foure hundred
<PB N="51" REF="35"/>
leagues distant from <HI>England;</HI> at which when the ships have touched, and supplied them∣selves with such necessaries as they want, which commonly they doe at the <HI>Tercerae</HI> I∣slands, but never stay to goe on shore, they set sayle from thence directly for Saint <HI>Lu∣car</HI> or <HI>Cadiz;</HI> which, when the coast of <HI>Por∣tugal</HI> was free for them, and that they might come up securely with the Cape Saint <HI>Vincent,</HI> they usually reached in fourteene or fifteene dayes; but now of late, by reason of the Warres, and the revolt of that Nation from the Spanyard, they doe a little decline that coast, and consequently come in some few dayes later than ordinary.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of some particular Adventures made by the English into the parts of <HI>America;</HI> especially those of Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Ca∣vendish,</HI> the Lord Admirall <HI>Clifford</HI> and o∣thers, which are briefly related.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. BY what hath beene said in the prece∣dent Chapter, the English will in part perceive how the voyage to the west Indies is
<PB N="52" REF="36"/>
commonly made, where the chiefe difficulty or danger of it is, and how avoyded: what may seeme wanting to their more perfect in∣formation shall be supplied in the particular description of the several places, Ports and Roades for shipping, which belong to the re∣spective Provinces. At present for the enter∣tainment of the Reader, and to performe an office of due respect unto the memorie of som brave men of our Nation, who have formerly visited those coasts with good advantage to themselves and honor to the Nation; I shall endeavor to give a brief account of the At∣chievements of some of the principall of them, leaving the rest unto such particular occasions of remembring them, as will occurre in the dis∣course afterwards; and begin first with him whose memorie is deservedly most famous and honored by all men, for his extraordinary a∣bilities, experience, and happy conduct at Sea, <HI>viz.</HI> with Sir <HI>Francis Drake.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This brave Sea-man, at the first begin∣nings of his actions, was Captain of the <HI>Judith,</HI> with Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> in the voyage of <HI>Gui∣ny,</HI> one thousand five hundred sixty seven, and received together with him some considerable damage and injuries from the Spanyard, in the Port of Saint <HI>John D' Ʋllua</HI> of the West-In∣dies,
<PB N="53" REF="36"/>
contrary to promise and agreement with him, and therefore to repayre himselfe, ha∣ving first beene assured by some Divines that his Cause and Designe was just, as Master <HI>Camden</HI> witnesseth of him; In the yeere one thousand five hundred seventy two, he set out for <HI>America</HI> with two ships and a pinnace, whereof that called the <HI>Dragon</HI> was comman∣ded by himself, and at his first attempt surpri∣zeth <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> at that time one of the richest Townes of <HI>America:</HI> But in the A∣ction, happening to receive a wound in one of his feet, which disabled him very much, he was not able either to hold the place, or to ga∣ther that rich spoyle that lay even in sight be∣fore him. For his Company, a little too much discouraged with his disaster, carried him back to the Ships, almost whether he would or no, to the great joy and content of the Spaniards, leaving the town and an infinite mass of trea∣sure behinde them untouch'd; a great part whereof they saw with their own eyes in the Governors house, namely huge bars of silver lying round about the Hall of his Palace, piled up a great height from the ground, ready to be laded and transported for <HI>Spain,</HI> as soon as the Ships came. But there wanted some reso∣lution in his company, by whom, being over-borne,
<PB N="54" REF="37"/>
he was forced to put to Sea much a∣gainst his Will; so that the success of his first enterprise served onely to whet his stomach and courage, to give them a second visit as soon as might be. Being somewhat recovered of his wound, he falls with his Ships into the Sound of <HI>Darien,</HI> where he lighted upon a cer∣tain People called <HI>Symerons,</HI> which are, for the most part <HI>Negros,</HI> and such as having been Slaves to the Spaniards, by reason of their cruelty and hard usage are run from them▪ they live in Woods and wild places of the Countrie, in great companies together, not much unlike to other Savages, hating the Spa∣niards deadly and doing them upon all occa∣sions what mischief they can. By these he gets Intelligence, that a <HI>Requa,</HI> as they there call it, that is, a certain number of Mules (most commonly they are fourty or fiftie in a com∣pany) laden with Treasure and other things, was to pass within few daies from <HI>Panama</HI> in the South-Sea, to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> to be Ship'd from thence for <HI>Spain;</HI> which he there∣fore resolved, if it were possible, to surprize. These <HI>Requas</HI> from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Ventacruz,</HI> which is about six leagues distant, in the roade to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> doe constantly travel in the night, by reason of the openness of the
<PB N="55" REF="37"/>
way and the excessive heats in the day time: neither had they as then any other guard but onely of those who drive them, and perhaps some Gentleman or Officer of the Kings to oversee the Treasure, by reason of their great security, and that they had liv'd til then with∣out all fear or suspicion of an enemy upon that coast; so that the enterprise seemed to them not to be any matter of great difficultie. Wherefore having gained a sufficient number of those <HI>Symerons</HI> to his party, which he might easily doe, with no more than eighteen stout and resolute men of his own, lea∣ving the rest to guard and manage the Ships as occasion might be, they march by night over the Streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> as 'tis called, which is that <HI>Isthmus,</HI> or neck of Land that joyns the two parts of <HI>America</HI> together, <HI>viz.</HI> the Northern and the Southern part, and contains in that part of it where they were, not above eighteen or twenty miles over, from Sea to Sea, though in length it be many leagues. They were come down undiscovered within one league of <HI>Pa∣nama,</HI> and had lodged themselves in a Grove on each side of the road where the <HI>Requa</HI> or company of Mules was to pass: which accor∣ding to their expectation also came, and, as the manner is, so tyed one to another, that if you
<PB N="56" REF="38"/>
stop one, you make them all stand. The <HI>Requa,</HI> which was now coming, belonged for the most part of it, to the Treasurer of <HI>Lima</HI> who with his Daughter and Family, were going for <HI>Spain</HI> with eight Mules in the company laden with Gold, and one with Jewels: which without question had been all taken but for the indi∣scretion of one English-man, named <HI>Robert Pike;</HI> who having drank a little too much Strong-water in his martch, was become pot-valiant with it, so as his companion could not keep him to his postures nor perswade him to lye close, as they were commanded to doe, till the watch-word should be given; but hearing the Mules come neer, out of a foolish bravery and ambition to be the first that should give onset in such an Action, stood up; and wea∣ring his shirt uppermost, as they did all, the better to distinguish and know one another in the night, was instantly descryed by a Spa∣nish Cavaleer that rode a little before the Mules; who, suspecting what it might be, pre∣sently turn'd his horse, and gave such speedy notice thereof, that the principall part of the Treasure which came behinde, together with the Treasurer himself, his Daughter, and other of his company, were saved by a timely retreat, and onely some few of the formost Mules ta∣ken:
<PB N="57" REF="38"/>
which, as they had some Treasure, so the English, knowing how soon the Countrie would be alarm'd by reason of their discovery, durst scarce stay to ransak them, but taking a little of what came next to hand, resolutely made their way through <HI>Venta cruz.</HI> and so by woods and wild forests of the Countrie to the Ships, which expected them in the Sound; yet having the good fortune by the way, about <HI>Rio Francisco,</HI> to meet a smaller <HI>Requa</HI> of Mules laden with silver and some gold, which having better leisure to examine, they took and carried as much of it as they could away with them to their Ships, burying the rest in the ground.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the year 1577 was his voyage a∣bout the World, in which to his immortall Fame and Honour, he was the first Comman∣der of note that encompassed this Earths Globe and returned safe home again. For though <HI>Ferdinand Magellan</HI> had discovered the Streits before him, and gone far, yet he li∣ved not to return home, being slain at the <HI>Mo∣luccae</HI> Islands, while he was reducing them to the obedience of his new Master, the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> This voyage afforded Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> some better amends and satisfaction from the Spaniards, than the former had done; though
<PB N="58" REF="39"/>
even that was not altogether without profit. For in this he not onely took and well rifled many Towns and places of the Spaniards, up∣on the coasts of <HI>America</HI> (which they that write the passages of the voyage report more at large;) but especially he met with divers rich prizes at Sea; as namely at <HI>Valparaiso</HI> in the South Sea, a ship laden with Wines and as much of the finest Gold of <HI>Baldivia</HI> (which is counted the best of all) as amounted to thir∣tie seven thousand Duckets of Spanish money, beside silver and other good Commodities. At <HI>Tarapaxa,</HI> upon the same coast, he met with thirteen bars of pure silver, amounting to four thousand Duckets: And after that with eight hundred pound weight of silver, that was going for <HI>Arica</HI> to be shipt from thence to <HI>Panama,</HI> and so for <HI>Spain,</HI> laden upon <HI>Pa∣cos,</HI> which are certain Sheep of <HI>America</HI> about the bigness of Asses, which they use as Beasts of Burthen, especially for the carriage of their Treasure by Land from place to place. At <HI>Arica</HI> they rifle certain Barks and other small Vessels which they found in the Port, and take out of them, beside other Merchandize, fiftie seven wedges of pure silver, every one of them of the weight of twenty pound a piece, and a∣mounting in all to one thousand one hundred
<PB N="59" REF="39"/>
fourty pound weight of silver. At <HI>Lima</HI> they enter the Haven, where they found about twelve sail of ships fast moored at Anchor, their sails taken off, and all the Mariners secure on shore; whereupon examining the ships, they finde in them, besides aboundance of Silks, Linnen and other good Commodities which they took, one chest full of Ryalls, of Plate, which they thought not good to leave behinde; and (which pleased them as much as all the rest) they got intelligence here of another great Spanish ship, called the <HI>Caca∣fuego,</HI> which was at <HI>Payta,</HI> laden with nothing but Treasure. This ship had perceived them at Sea, and was making all the sail she could for <HI>Panama:</HI> But before she could recover the Port, they pursuing her very hard, about Cape <HI>Francisco</HI> they get sight of her, and after some short dispute board her and make her yeild. In this ship they found thirteen great Chests full of Ryalls of Plate, twenty six Tun of other silver, four-score pound weight of pure gold, besides aboundance of Jewels, precious Stones, and other rich Merchandise: all which became prize; having also in their way while they were pursuing of her, met a single Bark laden outwardly with nothing but ropes and tack∣ling for ships, but seaching more within, they
<PB N="60" REF="40"/>
found no less than seventy eight pound weight of fine gold, beside many great and goodly Emeraulds, with other Jewels. They took all, and setting their sail for <HI>Guatulco,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Acapulco,</HI> a noted and much frequented Port of these Seas, in their way they meet a ship from <HI>China,</HI> laden with Silks and <HI>China</HI> dishes, of which they take as much as they thought good, and after that rifle the Town of <HI>Guatulco</HI> it self; where, beside some quan∣tity of gold, jewels and other plate, they finde one pot of the bigness of an English bushel, full of Spanish Ryals; which having emptied they departed without being farther trouble∣some: onely one <HI>Thomas Moon</HI> an English man borrowed a chain of gold, which he hap∣ned to finde about a Spaniard, just as they were going out of Town. At this place, finding themselves reasonably well laden, and that their ships had endured the Sea a long time, they resolve to return for <HI>England;</HI> which af∣ter some time they likewise did, by the way of the <HI>Moluccae</HI> and <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, and on the third of <HI>November</HI> 1580, which was the third year of their voyage, they safely arrive at <HI>Plimouth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In the year 1585. this noble and re∣nowned Sea-man, having been first Knighted,
<PB N="61" REF="40"/>
and otherwise also much honoured by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> made another voyage to <HI>America</HI> with a greater number of Ships; in which voy∣age, beside other places of less note, he took and burnt a good part of the Town of St. <HI>Do∣mingo,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> forcing the Inhabitants to redeem the other part with a summe of twenty five thousand Duckets ready Money. He took also <HI>Carthagena,</HI> a Town upon the Continent, and in it <HI>Alonso Bravo</HI> the Governour, and after the burning of some houses had the summe of eleven thousand Duckets paid him by the Inhabitants to spare the rest. He took likewise the Towns of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> and St. <HI>Helena:</HI> But at last the English in the Ships falling sick of the Calen∣ture, and many dying, he was forced to return for <HI>England</HI> with what he had already got; which upon value was found to amount unto threescore thousand pound sterling, of cleer prize, beside two hundred pieces of Brass Or∣dinance, and fourty of Iron.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the year 1595. was his last voyage, which proved not altogether so successfull to him as the former, by reason (as is supposed) of some misunderstanding betwixt him and Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> who was the other Gene∣rall joyned in Commission with him for the
<PB N="62" REF="41"/>
expedition. They both ended their dayes in this voyage; and particularly Sir <HI>John Haw∣kins</HI> before <HI>Port-rico,</HI> as soon as ever the ships came in sight of the place. After which Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> being now sole General, made an attempt upon it, <HI>viz.</HI> upon <HI>Port-rico,</HI> but could doe no more than fire some of the ships in the Haven, receiving also some loss himself. Nevertheless, after this hee took <HI>Rio de la Ha∣cha, Rancheria,</HI> which at that time was a rich Town, through the Trade of Pearl-fishing; and last of all <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> but found no∣thing so much Treasure in it now, as he saw the first time: And from hence marching by Land towards <HI>Panama,</HI> he had hopes to have surprised that place: But Sir <HI>Thomas Basker∣vile,</HI> who commanded a Party of seven hun∣dred and fiftie Souldiers upon that designe, found the passages over some mountains so difficult, by reason of their straitness, and the passes so well fortified and guarded, that he was forced to retreat, not without some loss of men, which the Spaniards knowing the Countrie better than they, and having the ad∣vantage of the Woods on both sides of the way as they marched, killed in their return. By reason whereof they were forced to put to Sea again; where, not long after, the General
<PB N="63" REF="41"/>
himself fell sick, and partly of a Flux, and partly of griefe, as 'tis supposed, that things suc∣ceeded no better, having been hitherto in all his endeavors acquainted onely with success and victory, dyed within few daies, before <HI>Porto-bello,</HI> and almost within sight of <HI>Nom∣bre de Dios;</HI> and the Fleet under the com∣mand of Sir <HI>Thomas Baskervile,</HI> returned for <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> his voyage.</HEAD>
<P N="6">6. The second in renown among English∣men for the Adventures of <HI>America,</HI> and espe∣cially for a prosperous and compleat circum∣navigation of the Ocean, was my honoured Countriman Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> of <HI>Trimley</HI> in <HI>Suffolk:</HI> who in the year 1586. with three ships and about one hundred and twenty men set out from <HI>Plimouth</HI> for the <HI>West-Indies</HI> upon Thursday the 21. of <HI>July,</HI> having in his company Captain <HI>Francis Pretty</HI> of <HI>Eye,</HI> Captain <HI>Havers,</HI> Captain <HI>Mellis,</HI> and some other Gentlemen: and the 25. of <HI>August</HI> following fell with the point <HI>Sierra Liona</HI> on the coast of <HI>Guinny;</HI> and from thence by the 7. of <HI>September</HI> with the Island <HI>Madrabamba,</HI> which is one of those about <HI>Cape verde;</HI> a
<PB N="64" REF="42"/>
place very convenient for the taking in of fresh water and other necessaries for men at Sea, but otherwise much subject to sudden claps of Thunder, Lightnings, and Storms, especially in Winter. Their designe was for the Streits and the South Sea; wherefore declining the Islands and the coast of <HI>Terra firma,</HI> as they call it, which is that part of the Continent of <HI>America</HI> which lyeth West and South-west of the Islands, they steer their course more direct∣ly South, and by the latter end of <HI>October</HI> they discover <HI>Cape Frio</HI> on the coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and put in with an harbour betwixt the Island of St. <HI>Sebastian</HI> and the Continent, where they stay some time, building a new Pinnace, and supplying their Ships with such other necessa∣ries as the Country afforded. After which they put to Sea again, directing their course immediatly for the Streits; to which place from the utmost coast of <HI>Brasil</HI> Southward it s reckoned commonly six hundred leagues. <HI>December</HI> the 18. they enter the harbor called <HI>Port desire,</HI> which is a very good Harbor, and hath a safe road for Shipping before it. From hence on the 6. of <HI>January</HI> they put in for the Streits mouth, and after a few daies come to Anchor, not farre from the place where the Spaniards had a designe to have built and for∣tifyed
<PB N="65" REF="42"/>
a Town for the command of the Streits, and the securing of the passage into the South Sea against all Nations but themselves. But, as it appeared, their project took no effect. For of four hundred men left there two or three years before, by <HI>Don Pedro Sarmiento,</HI> to that purpose by order of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> there was scarce twenty remaining alive when Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> sailed that way; the rest were either starved for want of necessarie Pro∣visions, or destroyed by the Natives. They had begun their Town, (which they named St. <HI>Phi∣lip</HI>) upon the narrowest passage of the Streits, about fourteen leagues within the mouth to the Southward, and not above half a mile broad, in a place very convenient for their purpose, and the Town it self well contrived, with four several Forts, and every Fort having some piece or pieces of Ordinance to defend it; which the Spaniards, when they saw them∣selves left destitute, and not able to subsist any longer there, had buried in the ground; but the carriages of them standing open and in view, upon search the pieces themselves were soon found and taken by the English. Many of the Spaniards that had been left there, as above said, were found dead in their houses, and lying in their cloaths unburied. Those few
<PB N="66" REF="43"/>
that were alive (which were onely twenty three in all, whereof two Women) although they were scarce able to goe or to help them∣selves, yet were resolved, as they said, to tra∣vel by land towards <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> which is distant some hundred of leagues from the place where they were; which they had free leave to doe. The English thereupon made no long stay, but having named the place in∣stead of St. <HI>Philip, Port-famin,</HI> they departed, holding their course still along the Streits, till upon the 24. of <HI>February</HI> they entred the South Sea; having found the whole course of the Streits to be about ninetie leagues in length, and to lie in the same latitude (or at least with very little difference) at both ends, <HI>viz.</HI> in fiftie degrees and two Terces, South∣ward of the line, having good and convenient harbors on both sides, almost at every leagues end; but otherwise of a most difficult passage, by reason of many windings and turnings of the Sea, and of so many contrary windes, with which from severall coasts the passage is almost continually infested, but especially in the deep of Winter; at which time by reason of the in∣tollerable sharpness of the cold, frequent storms, &amp; huge flights of Snow, their is neither sailing nor abiding upon those Seas: nor is it
<PB N="67" REF="43"/>
so safe or easie at any time to repass, <HI>viz.</HI> back again out of the South Sea into the Atlantick or Northern, as it is to enter by the North Sea.</P>
<P N="7">7. Beeing got now into <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and, as it were, upon the back-side of <HI>America,</HI> they ply up and down those coasts, visiting, and not seldom pillaging the Towns, taking such ships as they meet withall, and steering their course now so far North-west, till at last, upon the 12<SUP>th</SUP>. of <HI>June</HI> 1587. they double or cross the Equinoctial line back again, sailing Northward of it, up towards <HI>Panama</HI> and the coast of <HI>New-Spain.</HI> But whether it were that intelligence had been given to those parts of their being upon the coasts, it was some∣time before they could spie any ships stirring. The first was upon the 9. of <HI>July,</HI> when they took a new ship of one hundred twenty Tuns burthen coming from <HI>Puna,</HI> but newly laun∣ched off the Stocks, laden chiefly with ropes and other tackling for ships, which they took; and in her one <HI>Michael Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cius</HI> a Provencall, borne at <HI>Marseills,</HI> who, to doe the Spaniards a pleasure, gave them information of a great ship called the <HI>St. Anna,</HI> which was expected from the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands; and which upon his information they took within a few dayes
<PB N="68" REF="44"/>
after, being the richest prize (one of them) that ever was taken and carried off those Seas by English-men. But first they sail to <HI>Acapul∣co</HI> or <HI>Guatulco,</HI> as some call it, and having ri∣fled the Town, in the Haven they take a Bark of fiftie Tuns burthen, laden with six hundred great bags of Anile, which is a rich sort of dye, every bag being estimated at fourty Crowns; and four hundred baggs of Cacao, which are a kinde of Fruit of <HI>America</HI> of the bigness of Almonds, and so much esteemed there, that they pass both for meat and money; every one of which baggs being valued at ten Crowns, the whole prize in the Barke, beside what they got in the Town, amounted to twenty eight thousand Crowns. From hence they set sail for the Bay of <HI>St. Jago,</HI> still Northward; and being come up as farr as the Tropique of <HI>Ca∣pricorne,</HI> they were in some distress for fresh water, having none visibly neerer them than thirty or fourty leagues. But by the advise of the above said <HI>Michael Sancius,</HI> who was a man of long and great experience upon those Coasts, they digged some four or five foot deep in the ground, and found very good fresh water in a soyle outwardly dry and san∣die; which he also told them was an usual experiment in many other places, upon those
<PB N="69" REF="44"/>
Coasts. About the middle of <HI>October</HI> they fall with the Cape <HI>St. Lucar,</HI> on the West∣side of the point of <HI>Califormia,</HI> and came to Anchor in the Bay called <HI>Aguada Segura,</HI> where they resolved to stay a while, and wait for the coming of the <HI>St. Anna</HI> abovesaid; which about the fourth of <HI>November</HI> follow∣ing appeared to their no little content. She was a ship of seven hundred Tuns burthen, and Admiral of those Seas; and therefore not onely richly laden but well manned. By noon the English ships got up with her, and gave her a broad-side, which she answered: but soon after put her self to a close fight, and ex∣pected boarding; which the English attempt∣ing, were twice beaten off, and forced to be∣take themselves again to their Ordinance, with which they so raked her from side to side, and ply'd it so continually, that after a dispute of some five or six hours she was made to yeeld, the Captain hanging out a flag of Truce, and begging mercy for their lives: which the Ge∣neral readily granted, and thereupon com∣manding him to strike sail and come on board, the Captain, Pilot, and some of the principall Merchants did so. They were in all an hundred and ninety persons in the ship, men and wo∣men, and professed that their lading was one hundred
<PB N="70" REF="45"/>
twenty two thousand Pezos of fine Gold, be∣side Silver, aboundance of Silks, Sattins, Da∣mask, Musk, Conserve of Fruits, Druggs, and other of the richest Merchandise of <HI>India,</HI> of which they could give no certain estimate. Now every Pezo we are to know, in silver, is valued at eight shillings, or not much less (for I confess there is some difference in Authors about the estimate of it:) and consequently in gold (according to the common proportion betwixt gold and silver, used at the <HI>Indies,</HI> which is twelve for one) a Pezo must be worth ninety six shillings, or 4 <ABBR>li.</ABBR> 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> so that the whole value of the prize could not be much less than a million of sterling money; enough to make them all Gentlemen that shared in it. The Spaniards and other people of the ship, according to their desire, were set on shore at the Port of <HI>Aguada Segura,</HI> with necessary provisions given them, both for their Subsi∣stance and defence in their travell.</P>
<P N="8">8. From hence the English set sail for the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, and in the space of fourty five dayes sailing, they reach the Islands <HI>La∣drones,</HI> as they are called, which lie in the way thither, about seventeen or eighteen hundred leagues from <HI>Califormia,</HI> whence they came, and in twelve or thirteen degrees of Northen
<PB N="71" REF="45"/>
latitude. They are a very convenient place for the taking in of fresh water, and for the supplying of ships at Sea, with many necessa∣ries in so long a voyage, but the people wholly barbarous and savage, and so extreamly given to pilfering and stealing, that from thence <HI>Magellan</HI> gave them their name, <HI>viz. La∣drones,</HI> or the Island of Theeves. From hence about the middle of <HI>January</HI> they arrive at <HI>Manilla,</HI> the chief of the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, and about three hundred seventy leagues di∣stant from <HI>Ladrones.</HI> This is counted to be the richest Countrie for gold in the World, but scarse of silver; so as the <HI>Sanguelos,</HI> as they call them, who are great and rich Mer∣chants of the Country, doe continually trade with the Americans of <HI>New-Spain</HI> for their silver, giving weight for weight for it in pure gold. From hence, about the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> they reach the Islands of <HI>Javia,</HI> where, by way of barter with the Inhabitants, for such things as they had got upon the coasts of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> they plentifully store their ships with all kinde of Flesh-meats, Fowles and Fruits necessary for their subsistance homeward, re∣ceiving at their going away a present of the same nature from the King of the Countrey, <HI>viz.</HI> two large fat Oxen alive, ten great and
<PB N="72" REF="46"/>
fat Hoggs, aboundance of Hens, Ducks, Geese, Eggs, a great quantity of Sugar Canes, Sugar in plate, Cocos, Plantans, sweet Oranges and sowre, Lymons, great store of good Wines, <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> Salt, with almost all maner of Victuals beside. And it was no more than they had need of in the place where they were. For putting again to Sea, and making for the <HI>Cape de buona Speranza,</HI> or of good hope, which is the utmost point of <HI>Africk</HI> South∣ward, they sailed upon that vast Atlantick Ocean, before they could reach the Cape, lit∣tle less than nine weeks, running a course of eighteen hundred and fiftie leagues at least, by Sea, without touching land; some recko∣ning it to be full two thousand leagues, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Islands of <HI>Java</HI> to the Cape of good Hope. There lyeth about fourty or fiftie leagues short of the Cape a certain Foreland called <HI>Cabo falso,</HI> because it is usually at its first discovery at Sea mistaken by Mariners for the true Cape. From hence by the eighteenth of <HI>June</HI> 1588. they fall in sight of the Island <HI>St. Helena,</HI> which lyeth in the main Ocean, and, as it were, in the middle way betwixt the Coast of <HI>Africk</HI> and <HI>Brasil</HI> in fifteen degrees and fourty eight minutes of Southern latitude, being distant from the Cape of good Hope
<PB N="73" REF="46"/>
betwixt five and six hundred leagues. It is a pleasant Island, and especially well stored with Fruits, as namely Oranges, Lymons, Pomegranats, Pomecitrons, Dates, and so proper for Figgs, that the trees bear all the year long, and at any time of the year a man may gather both blossoms, green Figgs, and ripe. It affordeth likewise good store of wilde Fowle, as Partridges, Pheasants, a kinde of Turkies, of colour black and white, and as big as ours in <HI>England;</HI> great plentie of Goats, and such aboundance of Swine fat and large, that they live wilde in Heards upon the moun∣tains, and are not to be taken but by hunting, and with great pains and industrie. From hence by the twenty fourth of <HI>August</HI> they discover <HI>Flores</HI> and <HI>Corvo,</HI> two of the <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> Islands; and upon the ninth of <HI>September</HI> following, having first suffered a terrible storm and tempest upon the English Coast, which carried away all their sails, and put them in great fear and danger of losing all they had got; yet at last by the mercy of God and favour of a good winde they arrived safely at <HI>Plimouth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the Earl of <HI>Cumberlands</HI> voyage.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The right honourable <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> had before this made several voyages and Adventures against the Spaniards in and towards the parts of <HI>America, viz.</HI> in the years 1586, 89, 92, 94, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with various success: But in the year 1597. he more publiquely and avowedly in his own person undertook an Expedition with eighteen or twenty good ships, and about a thousand men, being himself Admirall and Commander in cheif. He set out from <HI>Ports∣mouth</HI> on the sixth of <HI>March</HI> 1597. with de∣signe at first to attend the coming out of the Carracks, which goe yearly from <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> But being disapointed of them, through some intelligence that the Spaniards had gotten of his Lordships being at Sea, he sailed on for the coast of <HI>America,</HI> resolving by the way, with the consent of the principal Commanders with him, to make an attempt upon <HI>St. John de Port-rico,</HI> which is the prin∣cipal Town and Port to an Island that bears the same name, <HI>viz. Port-rico,</HI> lying upon the Coast of <HI>America</HI> in eighteen or nineteen de∣grees of Northern latitude. It was a place,
<PB N="75" REF="47"/>
where a few years before, Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> had received some loss, and Sir <HI>Nicholas Clif∣ford,</HI> the Earls brother, been slain by a shot from one of the Platforms, as hee sat at supper w<SUP>th</SUP> the General in the ship called the Defiance. The Town standeth in a little Peninsula by it self yet closely joyned to the main Island towards the North, being a place very well seated, and fortified with two strong Castles; the one of which is built chiefly for the defence of the Haven, the other of the Town. About three or four leagues distance before the Town lyeth a fair sandy Bay or Beach, which the Sea wash∣eth on one side; over which the English at their first landing marched directly to the Town, through a thick woody Forest, and at the end of that upon a Cawsey of some two or three score in length, and of breadth onely to admit three persons to march a breast; at the end thereof they perceived a strong bridge of wood to be built, which rea∣ched from one Island to the other, and joyned them both together, having also some Barica∣does to defend it, and a Block-house with Ordinance on the further side of the water. They were informed, that at a low water they might pass the bridge on either side of the Cawsey: whereupon waiting till two of the
<PB N="76" REF="48"/>
clock the next morning, when the ebb would be, they attempt the passage; but could not gain it, by reason the Ordinance played so thick and directly against the Cawsey: so they retreat with the loss of about fiftie men in all, wounded and killed. Next day the Generall gave command that another Fort, standing upon the principall Island, should be attached by Sea. The place was of dangerous access; yet by the help of some Musketeers that were gotten upon certain Rocks within the Island, so neer that they could play upon them in the Fort, within little more than an hours space, the Spaniards that kept it quitted the place, and they that attached it by Sea, in boats entred; howbeit the ship that brought them neer it was her self cast away upon the Rocks at the ebbing of the water, as it was at first feared that she would be. The Spaniards that had quitted the Fort, together with the chief of the Town that were not already fled, retire and betake themselves to another Fort, called the Fort <HI>Mora,</HI> giving the English leave to enter the Town, &amp; also to block up the Fort where∣in they were: So that in few dayes they were content to render themselves upon such terms as the Admiral offered them, and the English became Masters of all. The Town and Forts
<PB N="77" REF="48"/>
being thus taken, the Generals design was to have kept the place; which might easily enough have been done: But it was not long before the English, partly through some di∣stemperature of the aire, which in that place, it being a flat and low Island, is not so pure and cleer as in the higher part of the Country, but chiefly through their own intemperance and irregular dyet and drinking▪ the place af∣fording them plenty of all things, and espe∣cially of many luscious and strange Fruits, sick∣ned and dyed so fast of the Calenture, bloody-Flux, and other hot diseases, that after nine or ten weeks holding the place, and six hundred of his men dead, as abovesaid, his Lordship was forced to return for <HI>England,</HI> doing no fur∣ther hurt to the Town, save onely the bringing away of four score pieces of Ordinance, the Bells of their Church, and some quantity of Sugar and Ginger: nor sustaining other loss himself in the whole voyage, than of three score men slain upon taking the Town, the six hun∣dred dying of the Flux and other diseases, the <HI>Pegasus</HI> wracked upon <HI>Goodwin Sands,</HI> the old Frigot upon <HI>Ʋshent</HI> on the coast of <HI>Normandy</HI> with fourty men in them, and a Bark lost by tempest about the <HI>Bermudas.</HI> The Admiral at his returning, left Sir <HI>John Barcley</HI> behind
<PB N="78" REF="49"/>
him with some men and ships, to compound with the Spaniards for the Town: but they seeing the General himself was already gone, and knowing the condition of the English to be such, by reason of the sicknesses amongst them, that it was not likely Sir <HI>John</HI> would stay long after him, made no great haste to com∣pound, but found means to protract the bu∣siness so long, that at last the English were for∣ced to leave it to them, and that without burn∣ing or doing any other prejudice to it, accor∣ding as the Admiral had given order before; being a person of great honour, and one that sought honour more than spoyle, by the Expe∣dition; as the Spaniards well found.</P>

<HEAD>Of Captain <HI>John Oxenham.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Hitherto we have spoken of such Adven∣turers, and voyages to the New World, as were either publiquely or privatly owned and avowed by the State; here followeth one, who, as it seems, wanted that priviledge, going onely upon <HI>jus Naturae,</HI> as he conceived, and to re∣cover that by force, which he complained was by force taken from him, and having no other means left him whereby to obtain his right. This was Captain <HI>John Oxenham,</HI> a man who
<PB N="79" REF="49"/>
had formerly been Servant, Souldier, and Ma∣riner with Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and together with him sustained some loss by the Spaniards at the Port of <HI>St. John D'ullua:</HI> And there∣fore, notwithstanding his proceedings may seem to want some formalities of Law to ju∣stifie them, and that the Spaniards counted and sentenced him for a Pyrate, because he wanted Commission; yet seeing his Actions were not altogether groundless, and that his attempt was so memorably daring and hardy, and also so well and happily managed, so far as con∣cerned himself, I shall not fear to add his name, and a brief report of his Action, to the rest of these worthies.</P>
<P N="2">2. This man, as was said, had served Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in his Voyages and Adventures at Sea a long time, and had thereby gained him∣self no small skill in Maritime affairs, and was particularly acquainted with the Coasts and Commodities of the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> so that by the year 1575. he was got to be Captain of a ship of a hundred &amp; fourty Tuns burthen, carrying seventy men in her: with which in the year above-said he set sail for <HI>America,</HI> and arriveth at the Sownd of <HI>Darien,</HI> at that very place, where a few years before, Sir <HI>Fran∣cis Drake</HI> had fallen acquainted with the Sy∣meroons
<PB N="80" REF="50"/>
that put him upon the designe for <HI>Panama</HI> by Land, and of surprizing the Trea∣sure Mules; a Place and People which Cap∣tain <HI>Oxenham</HI> knew very well, and intended to make use of them now. Nor was it long be∣fore he lighted upon some of them stragling up and down in the wildes of the Country: but they tell him that the Mules travel not now, but with a strong guard of Souldiers; which was somewhat contrary to his expecta∣tion, and alterd his designe quite: neverthe∣less, being resolved to Act something worthy of a man, before he returned, it served not so much to disanimate him, as to put him and his companions upon a more hopefull, yet with∣all a more hard attempt: which was, that see∣ing there was now but little hopes of doing themselves any good by land, as they hoped, nor by Sea on that side they were, they resol∣ved to visit the other Coasts, and to trie their fortunes upon the South Sea. To this end the Captain brings his own ship on ground, and, as well as he could, covers her with boughs and such other rubbish as the place afforded; and burying his Ordinance in the ground, he with his company and six Negros to conduct them, march by Land towards the Coast of <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> Having gone a matter of twelve or

fourteen leagues they come to a River, which, as the Symeroons told him, ran directly into the South Sea. Here they cut down wood, build themselves a Pinnace of about fourty five foot long by the keel, and in her they put to Sea, making towards the Island of Pearls, which lyeth about twenty five leagues distant from <HI>Panama</HI> toward the South, hoping it would not be long before some ships from <HI>Peru</HI> or other parts of the South, would be sailing that way for <HI>Panama.</HI> So that by the way, however Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> hath deser∣vedly the honour of first discovering the South Sea to English-men, <HI>viz.</HI> by the onely open and known way of the Streits; yet it must be acknowledged, that Captain <HI>Oxenham</HI> was the first Englishman that ever sailed upon it with command.</P>
<P N="3">3. He had not waited long, but there comes a Bark from <HI>Quito</HI> (which is a Province of the Countrie of <HI>Peru</HI>) laden with Commodities, and having in her besides of fine gold sixtie thousand <HI>Pezos,</HI> which he took; and within six dayes after another from <HI>Lima,</HI> wherein he had no less than two hundred thousand Pezos of silver, in barrs. What a Pezo is, both in silver and gold hath been already said, in the relation of Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> his voyage.
<PB N="82" REF="51"/>
There are that render these <HI>Pezos pounds of weight,</HI> saying that he took two hundred thou∣sand <HI>pound weight</HI> of silver, and sixtie thousand <HI>pound weight</HI> of gold, which perhaps is not so well done, and may make the summe to seem less credible: for as much as every <HI>pound weight</HI> of silver, after the ordinary rate of five shillings the ounce, is worth four pound of sil∣ver in Coyne; and likewise every <HI>pound weight</HI> of gold, according to the common proportion betwixt gold and silver, which at the Indies is twelve for one, is worth fourty eight pound in Coyn; and consequently the whole value of the prize would amount to above three millions in gold and silver together, <HI>viz.</HI> two millions, eight hundred, and fourscore thou∣sand pound in gold, and eight hundred thou∣sand pound in silver; which perharps every body will not beleeve. I think it therefore better to express it by the usual term and va∣lue of a Pezo in Spanish, which is commonly said to be eight shillings of English money: and so the whole value of the prize taken amounted to nine hundred and sixtie thousand pound sterling in gold, and to fourscore thou∣sand pound in silver: which being found a competent prize, and enough to satisfie reaso∣nable men, they retire with their Pinnace up
<PB N="83" REF="51"/>
the River, intending to make what haste they could to their ship. But as it unhappily fell out, through the covetousness and dissention of some of his company, so much time was spent before they could agree about sharing of their bootie, and how to transport it to their ship, that the Spaniards at <HI>Panama</HI> had notice of them; whereupon ships were presently sent out to pursue them at Sea, and likewise some Souldiers to intercept their return by Land. The Captain himself, through the obstinacie and willfulness of some of his company, was forced to leave the Treasure with them, and to travel some leagues up into the Countrie to finde Negros that might help him to carry it, his own men refusing to doe it but at their own demands, and quarrelling with him for larger pay. In the mean time the Spanish ships that sought him at Sea come to the mouth of the River where they were gone up, and by the Feathers of certain Henns, which the Eng∣lish had taken, and, as it seems, plucked there, ghessed presently that they might be gone up the River; and thereupon putting in after them, they soon took both them and their prize together. The Captain, as I said, was absent: but by reason that either the Negros, or else some of the English themselves that
<PB N="84" REF="52"/>
were taken, had discovered their ship in the Sownd, neither he nor any of the rest escaped, but were all, first or last, met with by the Spa∣niards; and having no Commission to shew for what they did, were executed every man of them, onely two boyes saved. Thus, ended the stout and resolute Captain <HI>Oxenham;</HI> the Justice of whose cause I will not undertake to dispute with his Adversaries. I could wish it had been as perfectly just in all respects, as it was gallant and bravely managed on the Cap∣tains part; insomuch that his very enemies, who made him dye for it, doe yet admire and extoll it: being spoyled onely through the passion, covetousness, and self-will of some of his company, whose lives paid for their follie.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the situation, and most probable extent of the New World, the Temperature and Disposition of the Aire there, the quality of the Soile, and Nature of its several Climates.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe Spaniards and other Nations have not altogether the same sense con∣cerning the situation or extent of the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> Commonly they are taken to signifie that part of the World lately discovered, which lyeth Westward of the Worlds general and fixed Meridian, which, according to the com∣mon opinion, runneth through the <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> Islands, from one Pole to another, thereby dividing the Globe of the Earth into two equall parts, or Hemispheres. The Spa∣niards looking to the pretended Donation or Grant, made by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixth, to the Kings of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon, of whatsoever Lands or Islands discovered, or that should be discovered by them sailing Westward of the</HI> Azores, <HI>whether upon the coast of India or else∣where,</HI> doe not seldom comprehend under the notion of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and the New
<PB N="86" REF="53"/>
World, the <HI>Moluccae</HI> and <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, with some other places in the Indian Sea, though they lie cleerly in the Eastern Hemi∣sphere: which, because it seems not so proper∣ly done, and doth otherwise beget obscuritie in the Authors that treat of this subject, I thought it not amiss to give this <HI>Item</HI> of it here. According therefore to the most ordi∣narie and general acception of the word, <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> or the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> is that part of the World lately discovered, which lyeth West∣ward of the <HI>Azores,</HI> and the Worlds Meridian, and possesseth, either in Sea or Land, the great∣est part of that Hemisphere, <HI>viz.</HI> the Western Hemisphere of the World; the Land it self, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> being bounded Eastward and and South-East with the Atlantick Ocean; and Westward, and to the South-west with <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> the Northern borders of it be∣ing not yet known. A Countrie of so vast an extent, that some have equalled it to all the other three parts of the World, <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> together, to whom I can hardly assent; yet doe readily acknowledge it to be much larger than any one, yea perhaps than any two of the other parts, could they be exactly compared. It lyeth for the most part North and South, not directly, but somewhat in∣clining,
<PB N="87" REF="53"/>
in the Southern part of it, Eastward, and in the Northern part Westward, being in length, as 'tis commonly supposed, from <HI>Terra Magellanica</HI> in the South, to <HI>Estetiland</HI> and the further parts of <HI>Quivira</HI> in the North, above a thousand nine hundred and seaventy seaven Spanish leagues, which according to English or common measure, is more than six thousand miles; reaching from 60. degrees of Northern latitude (for so farr it hath been dis∣covered already by Land) unto 53 degrees of Southern: The breadth of it, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>St. Michael,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Piura,</HI> in the Pro∣vince of <HI>Quito</HI> upon the South Sea, to the <HI>Prefecture</HI> and Town of <HI>Parayba</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> where it is thought to be broadest, is reckoned to be 1300. leagues, and in the whole compass to contain little less than ten thousand leagues, or thirty thousand common English miles.</P>
<P N="2">2. The whole Countrie lyeth in the form of two <HI>Peninsula's,</HI> or large demy-Islands, joyned together by an Ihstmus or neck of Land called the Streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> of about an hun∣dred miles in length, but in breadth, <HI>viz.</HI> from one Sea to another in many places, espe∣cially about <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> not above seventeen and eighteen miles over.
<PB N="88" REF="54"/>
They that resemble the Country to the form of a <HI>Pyramis</HI> reversed, I suppose, would be understood onely of the Southern or Peru∣vian part, as 'tis called; neither is it so easie to conceive, where they lay the Basis of it: if from the Coast of <HI>Peru</HI> Westward, to the ut∣termost point of <HI>Brasil</HI> towards the East, as by the form of the Maps 'tis most probable they doe; the spire, or top, of their Pyramis will have somewhat an obtuse or blunt point; in as much as the Countrie of <HI>Magellanica,</HI> which lyeth upon the Streits and maketh the point of the Pyramis, is by confession some hundred of leagues over from East to West, or from the Atlantick to the South Sea, the Streits themselves running a course of one hundred and ninety leagues all along the Coast of it; and consequently must be of a far grea∣ter bredth than the Streit of <HI>Darien;</HI> where 'tis evident the Land of <HI>America,</HI> or rather of <HI>Pe∣ru,</HI> contracts it self into a much sharper point or Pyramis, <HI>viz.</HI> betwixt <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> as hath been said. To me (taking the whole Country, or both <HI>Peninsulas</HI> together) <HI>America</HI> seems rather to resemble some rich Usurers bagge, tyed fast in the mid'st; the one end whereof is rich and well stuff'd with Crowns, the other empty and loose; So seems
<PB N="89" REF="54"/>
<HI>America.</HI> The Southern part thereof contain∣ing the golden Countries of <HI>Peru, New-Gra∣nada, Castella aurea, Chile,</HI> and the rest, like the full bottome of the bagge, swells and spreads it self with a large circumference and border, both East and West: the Northern part, especially beyond <HI>New Spain</HI> and the Streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> which is as it were, <HI>the hand upon the Purse,</HI> and that part, by which the Ca∣tholike King both holds and commands all the rest, as the Provinces thereof seem to lye more scattered one from another, and not so com∣pacted together, as consisting much of Islands, and the Continent it self frequently divided with Bays and Inlets of the Sea, so in compa∣rison of the Southern Provinces, it affords but little of those precious Commodities, for which <HI>America's</HI> acquaintance is so much de∣sired by other Nations, and with equall care, policie, and good success hitherto, forbidden by the Spaniards.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a question among Cosmographers, too great for me to determine, whether <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> be really Continent or Island, that is, whether the Northern Borders of it be joyn∣ed to any part of <HI>Asia,</HI> or divided from it by some narrow Sea or Frith, as it is to the South∣ward from those, as yet undiscovered, Sou∣thern
<PB N="90" REF="55"/>
Lands, which lie on the other side of <HI>Magellan</HI>'s Streits? It seems to be the more common Opinion, at least amongst English∣men, that it is an Island, though a huge one, wholly surrounded by the Sea, and divided from <HI>Asia</HI> by a certain Frith or narrow Sea, which they call the Streits of <HI>Anian,</HI> from a Province of the Asiatique Tartarie which bea∣reth that name, and is supposed to border upon those Streits. Nor doe there want some presumptions of probability for it; as for ex∣ample, a report of <HI>Pliny,</HI> out of <HI>Cornelius Ne∣pos,</HI> an ancient and credible Author, of certain Indians that were driven by storm upon the Coasts of <HI>Suevia,</HI> or <HI>Suaben,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> in their Canoa's or little Boats; in which it had been impossible, for them to have come thi∣ther by any other passage, than by the North parts of <HI>America:</HI> Impossible, I say, to have come any other way, and not to have touched first at some other Lands, or Islands by the way, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the Coasts of <HI>Barbary, Spain, Portugall,</HI> the <HI>Azores,</HI> or <HI>Canarie</HI> Islands; by reason that a ship, or any thing else, floating at Sea, when it is not hindred or diverted by storms, tide, or some other accidentall cause, naturally of it self, and by the proper course and conduct of the waters onely, beareth to∣wards
<PB N="91" REF="55"/>
Land: Beside that, it is not very pro∣bable, they could have subsisted alive, and not been starved in so long journey, as to have come by <HI>Magellans</HI> Streits, or the Atlantick Ocean. There be extant likewise some posi∣tive testimonies of certain persons, that say, they have really passed that way, as of one <HI>Salvatierra</HI> a Portughese, and <HI>F. Ʋrdanetta</HI> a Religious man, mentioned by Mr. <HI>Carpen∣ter</HI> in his Geographie; and of one <HI>Juan de Fuca,</HI> is he is called, an ancient Greek Pilot, mentioned by Mr. <HI>Purchas,</HI> in his third part of <HI>Eng. Voyages, pag.</HI> 849.850. who is said to have lived fourty years in <HI>America,</HI> and in his own person to have discovered the passage in the year 1592. at the command of the Vice-Roy of <HI>Mexico.</HI> But of what credit these testimonies shall be thought, for ought I know, the Reader must judge: I onely report them as I finde them. I could heartily wish, for the honor and great advantage which the Nation might reap by it, by having thereby a free pas∣sage into the South Sea, and consequently a much shorter cut to the other Indies; that the passage were discovered, and the English well Masters of it, especially if it could be made so easily as the said Pilot <HI>Juan de Fuca</HI> pretend∣eth, and in so short a time as is the space of
<PB N="92" REF="56"/>
twenty daies; or from the Coast and neer the latitude of <HI>Virginia,</HI> as some others have ar∣gued, and seem to hope that it may. But for my part (ingenuously to speak what I think) I fear the Proverb may somwhat prevail upon the English in this point, <HI>Quod volumus faci∣lè credimus,</HI> and that the desire we have to finde such an advantageous passage is not the least argument to make us think, <HI>That it is to be found.</HI> Not that I conclude there is none; for that were to be too injurious against the positive depositions of those who are said to have made it, and which I my self cannot dis∣prove by any evident reason: And the report of Sir <HI>Thomas Button,</HI> mentioned in the same Mr. <HI>Purchas,</HI> concerning a strong Tide com∣ing from the West much about the same lati∣tude, seems to add something to the probabi∣lity of the passage: but that I think the disco∣very of it, especially from the Land on this side, or from any part of <HI>Europe</HI> immediatly, is a business of so great difficulty, that it is almost all one as if there were no passage. For how many of our own Nation, worthy men, and of great experience and skil at Sea, (not to speak of our Neighbours the Dutch, a People no less industrious and skilfull) have with un∣daunted courage and resolution undertaken
<PB N="93" REF="56"/>
it at several times with great hazard of their lives and charge to the Adventurers, yet al∣waies forced to return without effect? Those Northern Seas whither they sail Eastward or Westward, being so barred and block'd up, as it were, with huge and perpetual mountains of Ice, their nights so long, their day-time so dark, by reason of the continual foggs, mists, and flights of snow, which are ever and anon falling, and lastly the weather generally in those parts so extreamly cold and freezing, even in the midest of summer, that all things well considered, it may seem an attempt of small hope; and that Divine Providence by the order of Nature it self, or by the natural frame and constitution of this sublunarie and terre∣strial World, hath set a <HI>non plus ultra</HI> to hu∣mane indeavors that way. Nevertheless if the State think it expedient to make yet any fur∣ther tryall in the business, and to command the prosecution of it, with more publique au∣thority resolution and strength than as yet hath been used about it, as from so great wis∣dome I cannot but expect much, so for the ends abovesaid, <HI>viz</HI> the honour and advantage of the Nation, according to my dutie, I shall wish all happie success to it. But this perhaps will seem a digression; I shall therefore return.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="94" REF="57"/>4. The greatest part of <HI>America</HI> that is in∣habited or commanded by the Spaniards (to speak in the language of Astronomie) lyeth be∣tween the Tropicks of <HI>Cancer</HI> and <HI>Capricorn,</HI> or within the Torrid Zone, as it is called, but to speak more intelligibly to the general capa∣city of Readers, it lyeth in the middle part of the World in respect of North and South, so as it receives the raies of the Sun almost per∣pendicularly, striking upon it all the year long, and consequently should be much subject to heats and droughts, as the Countries of <HI>Ae∣thiopia, Aegypt, Lybia,</HI> and other parts of the World that lye in the same parallel, generally are. But with <HI>America</HI> it is not so: there is no Countrie in the World generally more temperate in respect of heat and cold, than the <HI>West-Indies</HI> be. The reason of the difference is partly the <HI>Brises,</HI> as they call them, or the Levant windes, which perpetually blow upon it from the East on both sides of the Aequator, together with other windes from all coasts of the Sea, that doe much qualifie and abate the heats, which otherwise, 'tis probable, would be not a little troublesome, especially in the plain Countrie and maritime parts of it: and partly the very site and position of the Coun∣trie it self, which more within Land is generally
<PB N="95" REF="57"/>
mountainous and hilly: so that from whatso∣ever Coast or part of the World you enter the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> travelling forward, you still mount upward and ascend, as it were, in some parts, to a very great height; which is true, not onely of the Continent or main-Land, but also of all or most of the Islands adjoyning: by reason whereof, not onely the Aire, for the most part, is found to be temperate, coole, and healthfull, but the valleys and lower grounds also very fertil and pleasant. Howbeit not in all parts of the Countrie alike, either for the one or the other, <HI>viz.</HI> either in respect of tem∣perature of Aire, or fertility of Soyle. For we are to know, the Countrie of <HI>America</HI> con∣sisteth generally of three several sorts of Land: The first whereof is flat, and, as it were, level ground, which lyeth for the most part upon the Sea Coasts, and takes up no small part of the Countrie, by reason that, as we have said, <HI>America</HI> is wholly, or at least for more than three parts of four surrounded and environed by Sea. The second is extream high Land, as consisting of the <HI>Andes,</HI> as they are called, which are a certain ridge or row of mountains, of such incredible altitude or height, that they are not thought to be paralleld in the world again. These run in a long and continued
<PB N="96" REF="58"/>
ridge through the whole Countrie of <HI>Peru,</HI> or the Southern part of <HI>America,</HI> from the Pro∣vince of <HI>Popayan</HI> almost up to <HI>Magellans</HI> streits, above a thousand leagues together; the tops of them being in most parts about twenty leagues over, and so perpetually covered with snow, that they are not much inhabited or known, save onely upon the borders, or lower skirts of them. The third is a mean Land be∣twixt both, consisting partly of mountains of lesser height, yet for the most part running pa∣rallel with the Andes through the whole Countrie of <HI>Peru</HI> Southward, and partly of vallies or low-land; both which together they call the <HI>Sierra</HI> or Hill-Countrie. And accor∣ding to this diversity of site, or position in the several parts or Provinces of <HI>America</HI> we are to expect a difference both in the temperature of the Aire, and in the qualitie of the Soyle. As for example, the Plains of <HI>America</HI> (for so they are commonly called) that is, the flat and lower parts of it, which lie upon the Sea Coasts, are generally hot and neither so much inhabi∣ted, nor counted so healthfull; yet neither are they scorched with any intolerable heats, by reason of the Brises, and those other frequent Sea gales, which, as we said, are continually blowing upon them, and as it were, cooling
<PB N="97" REF="58"/>
them from all parts: Nor yet are they parched with any immoderate droughts, although it never rains upon those parts of the Countrie, at any time of the year▪ for instead thereof, there falls continually every morning a cer∣tain dew, which after a time condensates, and turns into small pearly drops of water, which doth not a little refresh the Countrie. Beside that, this part of <HI>America,</HI> being a flat and le∣vel Countrie, it is so farr from being rendred incommodious for want of water, that in ma∣ny places it may seem to partake somewhat too much of that Element; as all along the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and also on the other side of <HI>America</HI> Westward; where the Country for a great part of it is rendred unhabitable, by reason of the great aboundance of Waters, which falling with such huge Torrents, as they doe, from the mountains more within Land, and finding no convenient passage in those le∣vel and flat Countries, doe many times drown the Lands on each side of them for a great space together; or at least render the Countrie less profitable and usefull, by opening so many great lakes, or standing waters, in all parts of the Countrie, and many of them of such vast extent, that they seem rather to be pettie Seas within Land; and by turning so much of the other
<PB N="98" REF="59"/>
Land into marish or fenny ground, as upon the Coasts of <HI>America</HI> is every where to be seen.</P>
<P N="5">5. Contrariwise upon the <HI>Andes,</HI> and in many parts of the Province of <HI>Chile,</HI> especially more towards the Streits, the Aire is extream cold, and not well to be indured; and beside, so strangely sharp and piercing of mens bodies, that for strangers, and such whose bodies are not used to it, it is not a little dangerous to travell that way. They report, that in the midst of Land it makes men Sea-sick, and cau∣seth the same alterations, vomitings and other distemperatures of the stomach and body, but much more violent and extream, which men commonly feel at their first going to Sea. This happens chiefly upon the mountains <HI>Pariacaca, Lucana,</HI> and <HI>Sora,</HI> which are part of the <HI>Andes.</HI> In other places, <HI>viz.</HI> about <HI>las Punas,</HI> which are another ridge of mountains, though lesser, running parallel with the <HI>Andes</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chile,</HI> the quality of the Aire is such, that it takes away a mans life suddenly, and before he feeleth any sensible alteration or griefe in himself, either from within or with∣out. Men drop down dead as they travel in the way, without finding any pain or sickness in themselves: others lose their hands and
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>
feet as they travel, or at least some of their fingers and toes, which fall and separate them∣selves from the other parts of the body, with no more sense or feeling, than when a rotten apple falls from the tree that bare it. And this, how fabulous soever it may seem, yet is it a certain truth. <HI>Acosta,</HI> and other Authors of approved credit, doe avouch it from their own experience, <HI>viz.</HI> of what they had found and felt in themselves, and from what they had observed and seen with their eyes in others: and it seems confirmed by Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> him∣self, who, in the relation of Sir <HI>Thomas Ca∣vendish</HI> his second voyage to the Streits (which to his great misfortune happened to be in the deep of Winter, and when the weather there is most intolerably cold and freezing, as hath been formerly said) reports a like acci∣dent, namely of one <HI>Harris</HI> an English-man, who going to blow his nose, had the ill hap to pull it off and cast it into the fire, before he was aware: and of one <HI>Anthony Knivett</HI> of the same company, whose toes came off with his stockings in like maner, through the extre∣mity of cold in those parts.</P>
<P N="6">6. But the <HI>Sierra</HI> or mean Land, <HI>viz.</HI> be∣twixt the height of the <HI>Andes</HI> and the lowness of the Plaines, as it takes up the farr greater
<PB N="100" REF="60"/>
part of the Countrie, so is it generally more temperate, healthfull and agreable to mens bodies: It is also aboundantly well watered with fair and pleasant Rivers, such as for the multitude of them, and the largeness of their respective streams are not to be paralleld in any other part of the World: It injoyeth con∣stantly its proper seasons of rain and fair wea∣ther, no less than <HI>Spain</HI> it self, and many other Countries of <HI>Europe;</HI> by reason whereof the Soile is likewise rendred so exceedingly fat and lusty, that it is to be admired what they report concerning the goodness and fertility of it. They have in many places two Harvests in a year, (as in the Island of <HI>Hispaniola</HI>) reaping in and about <HI>October</HI> that w<SUP>ch</SUP> they sow in <HI>Aprill</HI> or <HI>May;</HI> and in <HI>May,</HI> that which they sow in <HI>October:</HI> yea, some say, there is no kinde of Grain sown at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> but in some places or other it will ripen and be fit to reap within four moneths. All kinde of hearbs, roots, or whatsoever fruits of the Garden, as Melons, Cucumbers, &amp;c. in sixteen or twenty dayes at farthest. In some places a bushel of <HI>Maiz</HI> sown (which is their most ordinary bread-corn) yeeldeth two hundred bushels of increase; and a bushel of the best wheat, three∣score; and 'tis said to be an usual thing there,
<PB N="101" REF="60"/>
of an acre of ground well husbanded, to reap two hundred bushels, or twenty five quarters of any Grain whatsoever. As for Fruits, I mean such as are natural and of the proper growth of the Countrie, there is incredible plenty and variety of several kindes, and those incomparably fairer, larger, bigger, more lu∣scious and pleasing to the taste than are to be found elsewhere in the World: And as for such as have been transplanted thither out of <HI>Europe,</HI> as most kindes of European fruits have been, <HI>viz.</HI> Apples, Pears, Oranges, Ly∣mons, Quinces, Figgs, &amp;c. they doe not onely thrive well, but in a short time are exceedingly improved and bettered both in bigness, beauty, and taste, onely through the richness and lu∣stiness of the Soile. It is said, that an eare of wheat hath been seen there as big about as a mans arme in the brawn, and of above a span in length, and to have had growing in it above a thousand grains: A Raddish root hath been likewise seen there of the same bigness and length, <HI>viz.</HI> of a mans arme, very tender of sub∣stance, and of a pleasant taste. And 'tis com∣monly observ'd, that for Wheat and other grain of <HI>Europe,</HI> they choose out a less lusty and colder soile; because otherwise to sow it in the fattest and richer ground, it would run all out
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>
into stalk of a huge height indeed, but with∣out earing or ever bearing of Corn. There be whole Woods and Forests, as it were, of Oran∣ges, Lymons, Quinces, and other such fruit, both for bigness and beauty far exceeding the common ones of <HI>Spain,</HI> of the same kinde. At the Cittie of <HI>Cusco,</HI> which is the Metropo∣lis of <HI>Peru,</HI> they have ripe Grapes all the year long; and in diverse parts of the Countrie there be trees that bear fruit one half of the year on one side, and the other half year on the other, as <HI>Acosta</HI> reporteth of his own ex∣perience, of a Fig-tree in <HI>Malla,</HI> nigh the <HI>Citie of Kings:</HI> and others speak as much of other fruits in other parts of the Countrie. And so it is likewise for Cattel, I mean such as have been brought thither out of <HI>Europe,</HI> whe∣ther great or smal Cattel, as Kine, Sheep, Hogs, Goats, &amp;c. the increase that hath been of them would seem to be beyond beliefe, but that all Authors affirm it. In the Island of <HI>Hispa∣niola</HI> (and 'tis likewise the same in many parts of the Continent, and other Islands beside) there are many thousands of Cattel, that live wilde in Heards upon the mountains having no certain owner; so as it is free for any man to kill them that will: and thousands of them are every yeer killed onely for their Hides and
<PB N="103" REF="61"/>
the Tallow. And yet 'tis strange to consider what great multitudes of them are in privat mens possession. The Bishop of <HI>Venezuela</HI> onely is said to have had at one time 16000. head of great Cattel feeding upon his own Pastures: Another to have had of one Cow which he kept twenty six years for breed, to have had an increase of eight hundred head of Cattel; and 'tis not counted any unusual thing for the Farmours of <HI>America,</HI> especially such as are professed Grasiers, and doe undertake (as it is the custom there) to serve such a Town, Citie, or Place with flesh meat at a certain rate, by the year, to have the like num∣bers, <HI>viz.</HI> ten or twenty thousand head of Cattel of their own and feeding onely upon their own grounds; being also men of great estates, and reckoned commonly at one hun∣dred, two hundred, and three hundred thou∣sand Duckets a man, and upwards; living splendidly in their <HI>Estancias,</HI> as they call them, or Farme-houses in the Countrie, and main∣taining a Table both for dyet and ornament, not inferiour to most Knights, or the best Gen∣tlemen in <HI>Europe:</HI> which doubtless is an evidence beyond all dispute, of the goodness and fertility of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where they live, that such men as these can both

<P>Of the principal Commodities of <HI>America,</HI> both Naturall and Mercantile; and first of <HI>Maiz,</HI> of <HI>Cassavi, Jucca,</HI> and other roots there, of which they make bread.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. BUt to give some further assurance of the general richness and fertility of the Countrie at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> it is requisite that we speak somthing more in particular, of the several Commodities and Fruits which <HI>America</HI> yeeldeth. These I distinguish into two sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> Commodities Natural and Mer∣cantile. I call those commodities Natural which are so proper to the Place and Countrie of <HI>America,</HI> that as they grow there, so are they, at least for the most part, there likewise consumed and spent, as not being so fit or not so much used to be transported thence into any other parts by way of Merchandise; of which kinde, I suppose the most part of their Grain, Fruit, and Cattle may be reckoned to be. I call those Commodities Mercantile, which are generally brought from thence, and
<PB N="105" REF="62"/>
in so great aboundance, by the Merchants that trade in those parts; of which sort are chiefly the Metals of <HI>America, viz.</HI> Gold and Silver, to which must be added the great quantity of Pearle, precious stones and Jewels, yearly brought from thence, their Sugars, diverse sorts of Spicery and Druggs, aboundance of Cotton wooll and Cloath, Hides, many kindes of wood, as well Medicinal as other: of all which my purpose is to speak something, be∣fore I come to the particular description of the several Provinces in which they are found; but yet briefly, according as I am oblieged, and referring the Reader for more full satisfaction upon this subject, in case he desire it, to <HI>Acosta</HI> his Historie of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to <HI>Oviedo</HI> his ge∣neral Historie, whom I chiefly follow, and who treat of these things more at large. And first I shall begin with those Commodities which I call Naturall; and amongst them with such as are of most general necessity and use for the sustenance of mans life, <HI>viz.</HI> with that famous plant called <HI>Maiz,</HI> and some other plants and roots, of which at the <HI>West-Indies</HI> they commonly make their bread, as we in <HI>Europe</HI> doe of Wheat and other grain.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Maiz,</HI> the common bread corn of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> is a Plant, which groweth plentifully at
<PB N="106" REF="63"/>
the <HI>West-Indies</HI> in most parts of the Continent, upon a moist and hot ground, as that generally is. It groweth upon a certain cane or reed of good bigness and about two cubits high from the ground: it groweth grape-wise, that is, the grain or fruit thereof, not covered nor inclosed in any husk or cod, as other grains of corn most commonly are, but open and in clu∣sters, onely fenced on each side with a large and broad leafe, growing upwards by it to the full height of the <HI>Maiz.</HI> The cluster, or bunch of grains, is commonly a span and half long, sometimes more, rending sharp up to∣wards the top in the fashion of a Sugar-loaf, and of the bigness ordinarily of a mans arme; having upon the top of the cluster a certain tuft or bunch of long hairy fillets, which, as the grain comes to maturity, doe likewise grow long, and bend downwards on one side of the bunch, not much unlike to the fore-top of Time and Opportunitie, as they commonly picture it. The grains of this <HI>Maiz</HI> are round, like unto pease, but bigger: yet commonly six or seven hundred of them are contained in one cluster, and for the most part two or three clusters upon every cane or reed. They are white till they come to be ripe, and then they turn outwardly black, but the flower of them,
<PB N="107" REF="63"/>
or substance within, is still as white as snow: and maketh a kinde of bread, for strength or nourishment nothing inferiour to wheat. It naturally ingendreth much blood; so that strangers not used to it, if they eate overmuch of it at first, are subject to swel upon it, to be∣come scabbie, and obnoxious to such other diseases, as proceed of too much aboundance and heat of blood: but to such as are used to it and eate it moderately, they say, it is a most agreeable kinde of food, easie of concoction, not at all obstructive, as bread with us, whe∣ther of wheat or other grain, is generally held to be more or less, but rather in some degree purgative of noxious humors, and helpfull a∣gainst the stone, and other oppilations of the body; with which infirmities the Indians, that continually feed upon this <HI>Maiz,</HI> both in bread and many other waies dressed, are ob∣served seldom or never be troubled. The buds of it while they are green and tender, are of such a fat and delicious substance, that they use them commonly instead of oyle and butter, being no less pleasant and agreeable to the taste. They make Wine of it also, or a drink not less strong than Wine, and which, being freely ta∣ken, as quickly overcoms a man: which they make by steeping the grains of <HI>Maiz</HI> in wa∣ter
<PB N="108" REF="64"/>
till it breaks, and afterwards boyling it, much after the manner as we make ordinarily our beer of Mault. There are diverse sorts of this <HI>Maiz,</HI> but that which is most commonly used for bread, is this already described. Their way of eating it, especially with the commo∣ner sort of People, is most commonly boyled in the grain hot, which they doe much after the manner that the People of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Ja∣pan</HI> use in the boyling of their Rice, They have an earthen or some other sort of Vessel full of little holes at the bottom and round about the sides below, into which having put so much of the grains of <HI>Maiz</HI> as they think fit, and stopt it up; they set it into another vessel which they have full of water and already boyling on the fire; so as the water enters by little and little into the vessel where the <HI>Maiz</HI> is, through the little holes: with which the <HI>Maiz</HI> present∣ly beginneth to swel, and after a little boyling so stops the holes of the vessel, that no more water can enter; and so boyling it on still, it comes at last from a pulp or soft moisty sub∣stance, to be more firm and hard, and such as they use for bread. And when they eate it sin∣gle or alone as bread, they count this the best way of eating it, <HI>viz.</HI> in the grain hot: but otherwise dressing it, as they oftentimes doe,
<PB N="109" REF="64"/>
with oyle, butter, sugar, and diverse sorts of Spice, they make many other pleasant and de∣licious meats of it. This, as I said, is the more common way of using it by the ordinary sort of people; but the rich and better sort grinde the <HI>Maiz,</HI> as we doe our wheat, and bake it, for the most part, into little cakes, which con∣fectioned with sugar and spices, as they use, doe make a very curious and dainty kinde of meat.</P>
<P N="3">3. This is their <HI>Maiz,</HI> or the Indian wheat, as they call it. They have another kinde of bread at the <HI>West-Indies</HI> called <HI>Cassavi,</HI> made of a certain root which they call <HI>Jucca:</HI> it is a root of a large size and somewhat of a moist substance, the juyce whereof is held to be a kinde of poyson, especially to some persons: for of others I read, that they have eate of the root green and full of juyce, though not with∣out danger, nor perhaps without costing some of them their lives, as namely the English at <HI>Port-rico</HI> under the Earle of <HI>Cumberland:</HI> but the root of it, when it is well dryed, especially if they use so much art with it, as to grinde it and work it into paste, is made into a very good sort of bread▪ yet more nourishing than toothsome. For the chief art which they use about it, is rather in the planting of the root
<PB N="110" REF="65"/>
than otherwise, of which the manner is thus. They raise a bed of earth in some lusty and good soile of about nine or ten foot square every way, in which, at an equall distance, they set ten or twelve slips, as I may call them, or little branches, which grow naturally out of the same root, each of them about a foot long, on every side of the bed commonly three, and laid so aslope within the ground, that the ends of them all doe almost meet together in the middle of the bed: Out of these after a certain time there springs a set of new roots, which grow commonly to the bigness and length of a mans arme, and sometimes as big as a mans thigh; but this is onely when they let them lye a long time in the ground, <HI>viz.</HI> a year, or year and half: but then likewise they are said to be best, and to make the most plea∣sant and agreeable bread. By that time they are come to maturitie, the whole bed or plat of earth, on which they were planted, seems to to be all turned into roots. Then they take them out of the ground, and having scraped them a little on the outside, they slice or cut them into small pieces; which done, in a press made for that purpose, they strain and force out all the juyce they can, just in the same manner as some Countrie folk strain crabs, and press their
<PB N="111" REF="65"/>
cheese when they make it: and having by that means brought their <HI>Jucca</HI> into the fashion of a broad cake, but somewhat thin, they lay it up for some time, till it be more throughly dryed, and then use it for bread without more trouble. 'Tis said to have little or no taste at all in the eating (and that's probable enough, by the ordering of it) but as for vertue and nourishment, wondrous▪ good and wholsome; yet I remember <HI>Acosta,</HI> who had tasted of it, sayes plainly, he had rather eat a piece of the coursest and blackest bread he ever saw in his life. Neither doe they eate it, but first moist∣ned and steeped in some water or warm broath: the reason whereof is the excessive dryness of the bread, which is such that neither Wine, nor Milk, nor their <HI>Melasso,</HI> as they call it, which is the honey or sweet juyce of the sugar canes will pierce it; and therefore it keeps long, and they carrie it commonly to Sea instead of Bisket. By Land it is chiefly used in the <HI>Barlovente</HI> Islands, which are <HI>Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica, &amp;c.</HI> where there is not such plenty either of Wheat or <HI>Maiz;</HI> not through any defect or barrenness of the soile, but as it is rather thought, from some indisposition of the Aire and Climate; which is such, that the very meal which they bring thither sometimes
<PB N="112" REF="66"/>
from <HI>New Spain</HI> and from the <HI>Canaries,</HI> con∣tracts presently such a moistness, that they can hardly make any good bread of it; and that which they doe make will not keep, but in a few daies become moist and fluid again, and by consequence apt to corrupt; which is ge∣nerally attributed to the over-much humidity and heat of the Countrie.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is yet a third sort of bread made at the Indies, which they call <HI>Chugno,</HI> and is made likewise of a certain small root called <HI>Popa.</HI> This bread is used chiefly upon the <HI>Andes,</HI> and some parts of the <HI>Sierra</HI> or Hill-Countrie, and generally in all the colder parts and Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> where the root groweth plenti∣fully, and where, by reason of the cold, there is not so great plenty of Wheat or <HI>Maiz,</HI> nor yet perhaps of <HI>Cassavi</HI> or <HI>Jucca;</HI> which, how dry soever it be, when they have reduc'd it to bread, yet naturally is of a gross and juycie substance, luscious, or at least, not unpleasing to the taste, and requireth a warm and lusty soile. These <HI>Popas</HI> are a kinde of smaller root, not unlike to the <HI>Bulbocastanum,</HI> or ground-Chesnut, with many leaves growing out upon them: which they onely dry well in the Sun, and then grinde them; making a kinde of bread of them, which will keep long, and is probably
<PB N="113" REF="66"/>
of a good and strong nourishment; for it is much used at the Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> where the labour is hard. They eate these roots also dressed otherwise, both boyled and baked, and account them a very good meat.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of some choise and excellent Fruits, and Fruit-bearing Trees at the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THey have likewise plenty of Rice and Millet growing in <HI>America;</HI> but because they use them not so generally for bread, and that they are not proper to the Countrie, but found as plentifully elswhere, I shall pass them over, and come to speak of such Fruits, Fruit-bearing trees, and others, as are peculiar to the <HI>New-world,</HI> and either not at all, or not so plentifully, or at least not of such perfection and excellency found any where else.</P>
<P N="2">2. Amongst the Fruits, and trees that bear Fruit, at the <HI>New World,</HI> the <HI>Platano,</HI> or Plane tree, I suppose, for many respects may deserve the first place; not that it is the same tree which <HI>Pliny</HI> and the Ancients call the Plane, being
<PB N="114" REF="67"/>
neither so big (in any proportion) nor afford∣ing such a shade as the Roman Plane is said to doe; but onely for some resemblance which it beareth towards it, and especially in the largeness of its leaves, wherein the Plane at the Indies doth much exceed even that of the An∣cients. It groweth commonly two stades, or twice the height of a Man, from the ground, in a moist and wet soile, which it necessarily requireth, by reason that it makes a great stock, as they say, in the ground, that is, it casteth a very large root every way round about its bulk or body: which it self is not much above the bigness of a mans: out of which root, on all sides their spring diverse <HI>Siens</HI> or young <HI>Planes,</HI> round about the principal tree, every one apart by himself, and bearing fruit. The leaves of it are of a wonderfull bigness, of an ell broad, as some say, and above an ell and half long, hanging down to the ground, and sufficient to cover an ordinary man of stature from head to foot. The Fruit is for the most part a span long, and of the thickness of a Mans wrist, somewhat bending in the middle, and groweth in clusters commonly upon one bough, but that one so well laden, that it is said to be no unusual thing to gather two or three hundred Apples off that one bough. The
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>
Apple or Fruit of the <HI>Plane</HI> is at first green: but as it comes to ripeness, it turns yellow both within and without, and becomes a most plea∣sant Fruit both for sight and taste; though ma∣ny times they gather it green, and let it ripen in vessels made for that purpose; but it is best and sweetest, when it ripens upon the tree: The meat or substance of the Fruit within, when the rinde is taken off, is tender, very de∣licious and well nourishing, inclining never∣theless rather to cold than heat. The tree beareth fruit all the year long (as they say, 'tis usuall at the <HI>West-Indies</HI> for many or most Fruit-bearing trees to doe) and yet the same bough or stalk on which the fruit hangs, never beareth twice; but being cut away, another presently sprouteth in its room: so that there is a continuall succession, as it were, of new sprigs, young boughs, green fruit and ripe, ever following one another upon the principal stock. They are said to have whole groves of this kinde of tree in many parts of <HI>America,</HI> the fruit whereof yeelds no little profit and revenue to the owners; it being a fruit where∣in the Indians doe generally much delight, eating it commonly not onely raw, but likewise roasted, boyled in pottage, ba∣ked, conserv'd, confectioned, and a hun∣dred
<PB N="116" REF="68"/>
other wayes, in all which it serveth very well.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Coco</HI> is another excellent Fruit at the Indies. The tree which beareth it, is recko∣ned a kinde of Palme tree, not properly, but by reason of some resemblance it hath in growth to the ordinary Palme. It grows much upon the Sea coast, upon a dry and san∣dy ground, yet alwaies hot: and 'tis said then best of all to flourish, when 'tis planted neer to a Village, or some houses, or by the way side, seeming, as it were to be delighted, and to thrive the better for the dust and dirt, which in such places it is beaten withall. The body of the tree is smooth and slender, being in no part bigger about than a mans middle, and growing still more and more slender towards the top: nor doth it ever shoot forth a bough, sprig, or leafe, but at the very top, which is usually of the height of thirty or fourty foot at least; But there it brancheth out into many small boughs, in fashion not unlike to an Ostridges feather, thick set and not growing upward, but running out and spreading broad, as they grow, on all sides of the tree or stock. Uunderneath, and, as it were, in the shade and coverture of which boughs, the <HI>Cocos,</HI> or <HI>Co∣ker-nuts,</HI> as they call them (which are the fruit
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>
of the tree) doe grow in little clusters, some∣times three or four of them together, imme∣diatly out of the stem or stock of the tree, reaching according to the number and quan∣tity of them that grow, about a yard or more downward from the boughs. Every <HI>Coco</HI> or Nut is commonly as big as a mans head, of the fashion of the lesser sort of Mellons, and of so hard a shel, that if one of them should happen to light upon a mans head, falling from the tree (as commonly they doe fall when they are ripe) considering the height of the tree, he would have no great need of a Surgeon. Ne∣vertheless the Fruit it self is admirable and rare in many respects, and serves the Indians for a hundred uses both of necessity and delight. Outwardly it is fenced with a green rinde or covering of a fibrous substance, full of many small strings or sinews, like threds; which therefore, when it is dry, they card out into a kinde of hards or course Tow, and make cord∣age of it, ropes for their Canoa's and ships, Match; but most commonly they use it for the stopping up of the ribs of ships, and in leakes; to which purpose it serveth excellently well, by reason that if it be never so little moistened, it presently swels, and by that means keeps out water better than any other stuff
<PB N="118" REF="69"/>
they can use. Next to this rinde or outmost covering, which is commonly two fingers thick, there is a hard shell which contains in it a certain liquid substance, very delicious and pleasant, which while the fruit is green, is thin and cleer like water, but as white as milk, which they therefore drink both for the dain∣tiness of the taste, and to cool them in the heat; but when the fruit comes to be ripe, it grows more jelly and thick, and likewise more plea∣sant. The quantity of it is commonly a pint and half, or a quart, more or less according to the bigness of the <HI>Coco.</HI> Of this liquor, beside that they drink it immediatly out of the fruit, as I have said, according to several waies which they use it, they make both Oyle, Wine, Vine∣gar, and also milk of it; and serves reasonably well in all. The liquor it self drunk raw out of the fruit, is thought to be somewhat flatu∣lent, and to breed crudities and other gross humours in the body, if it should be drunk over-much: nevertheless it procures urine aboundantly, and they say the Indians, who continually drink of it, are so little troubled with the stone or any other infirmities of the Reins, that they know not what they mean: and it yeeldeth such plenty of this liquor, that one tree of these <HI>Cocos,</HI> if it thrives well, is
<PB N="119" REF="69"/>
thought sufficient to supply a whole Family of no great number of persons, with Wine, Oyle, and Milk of it self alone. For every moneth it shoots forth new boughs and new <HI>Cocos,</HI> and 'tis not counted a good tree that beareth not fourty or fiftie <HI>Cocos,</HI> at least, every moneth. In the midst of this liquor lyeth the kernel of the Nut, or the principal meat of the <HI>Coco.</HI> This is a white and tender substance, in taste much like unto Almonds, taking up all the rest of the room in the <HI>Coco</HI>-shel, and con∣taining likewise in it another sweet and deli∣cate liquor, which is held to be both comforta∣ble and cordial. They have likewise another way to extract Wine out of the <HI>Coco;</HI> which is to cut the rinde and bark off the tree, but most especially off the boughs and fruit, while it is green, from which presently there issueth and drops a certain liquor no less pleasant than Wine, which they receive into vessels prepared for that purpose; which liquor they commonly also boyle, and make of it a kinde of Honey or Sugar, more esteemed than that which is common.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is another kinde of this <HI>Coco,</HI> which groweth most upon the <HI>Andes,</HI> in bigness not much less than the other; but instead of the fat oylie substance in the middle of those of the
<PB N="120" REF="70"/>
first sort, these are filled with an huge number of small kernels or nuts, like to Almonds, or the graines of a Pomegranate admirably com∣pacted and laid together. These kernels differ not much from Almonds in taste, and are a meat reasonably pleasant, so as the Confectio∣ners use them commonly for Marchpains and other banquetting Stuff, instead of Almonds; although of that kinde of fruit, <HI>viz.</HI> Almonds, they want not most excellent ones at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> especially those of the Province of <HI>Cha∣copoyas</HI> in the Kingdome of <HI>Peru,</HI> which are said to be the most pleasing, delicate, and wholsome fruit in the World, of a more fat tender and delicous substance by far, than those of <HI>Castile,</HI> and for the most part much bigger.</P>
<P N="5">5. Besides these, there is at the <HI>New World</HI> another tree called <HI>Coca,</HI> which though it bea∣reth not any fruit that is much spoken of, yet by reason it hath some affinitie of name with the <HI>Coco,</HI> and is likewise a tree not a little esteemed there, it requireth that we speak something of it. It is a tree that grows well onely upon hot and moist grounds, and not much above a fathom high from the ground; yet requiring good care and skil to husband it. It is in estimation onely for its broad leafe,
<PB N="121" REF="70"/>
which it casteth forth every fourth moneth new, to which leafe the Indians attribute I know not how many strange vertues and ope∣rations. This is certain and confirmed by dai∣ly experience, that it helpeth much against weariness of the bodie in any kinde of labour or travell, that it reviveth and exhilarates a mans spirits, seeming to infuse new courage and strength into him; insomuch that the In∣dians will oftentimes goe three or four daies together about business with no other meat or victuals but a few leaves of this <HI>Coca</HI> cham∣ped in their mouthes. For which reason 'tis counted one of the chiefest Commodities at <HI>Potozi,</HI> not onely amongst the Miners them∣selves, but generally with all other People; and they travel far to get it, <HI>viz.</HI> as far as the <HI>Andes,</HI> on the skirts whereof it chiefly groweth. They gather it with a great deale of care; and the leafe being very broad, they have great Baskets or Hampers made on purpose, into which they put it, and so lade their Mules or <HI>Pacos</HI> with it, and away for <HI>Potozi,</HI> where it is present Merchandise. They sell it for the most part at three or four <HI>pe∣zos</HI> a Basket, and vend commonly one yeer with another four-score or a hundred thou∣sand Basket sthere.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="122" REF="71"/>6. Another admirable tree there is at the Indies, called the <HI>Magney</HI> or <HI>Mete-tree;</HI> of which they report wonders, as namely that it yeeldeth them both Water, Wine, Oyle, Vi∣negar, Thred, Needles, and I know not how many other necessary things beside; not alto∣gether untruly. The tree, according to the description which <HI>Acosta</HI> gives of it, is of a big body, and groweth commonly in the open fields, being of a moist and tender substance, hollow in the midst: which therefore, when it is green, they use to cut; and at the places where they make incision, there issueth a cer∣tain liquor fresh and sweet, which they com∣monly drink raw, as it issueth from the tree, gathering it in vessels of gourds, <HI>Coco</HI>-shels, and others which they set there on purpose to receive it. This liquor, according as they seeth or boyle it more or less, becomes a Wine of a pleasant good taste, or Honey, or Sirup, or Vinegar, every one in their kinde good and wholsome. It beareth a large broad leafe, or rather, as some say, diverse kindes of leaves; of which, while they are tender, they make rare and curious conserves; but when they are grown out to their full bigness, being of a gross fibrous substance, they draw out of it a kinde of thred like unto Hemp or Flax, which
<PB N="123" REF="71"/>
they afterwards spin and work into Mantles, Matts, Shoes, Girdles and many other neces∣sary things, and of the rest make a sort of course Paper: and of the point of the leafe, which is both hard and also very sharp, they make Needles, that is, such instruments to sow withall as they had and used before the Spaniards came among them. The bark of the tree is both fat and very unctious; so that, being roasted they make a salve of it, as 'tis said, very good for hurts, bruises and old sores; and from the boughs they gather a certain gum, which they likewise report to be a sovereign Antidote against poysons. The trees grow generally in all parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> but chiefly in the Countrie of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>New Spain;</HI> wher there is scarse an Indian to be found worth the house that he dwels in, but will be carefull to have some of these trees planted and growing about it, for the many necessarie sup∣plies which it affordeth towards the mainte∣nance of a house and family.</P>
<P N="7">7. And in the Countrie of <HI>New Spain</HI> there likewise groweth another famous tree, called the <HI>Tuna</HI> or <HI>Tunall</HI> tree. It is originally from the root, nothing but a heap, as it were, of great broad leaves growing one out of ano∣ther, as well from the ground as upwards;
<PB N="124" REF="72"/>
the leaves long and large, not sharp or pointed, but round at the ends, and of the thickness of a mans thumb or finger: in which manner growing, it possesseth in time a good large space of ground, and likewise grows upward into the fashion and height of some ordinary tree. Its manner of growing is onely by new leaves sprouting out at the ends of the old, and the old ones still waxing bigger and bigger; so that at last it seemeth to have got a body and boughs, which is yet nothing else but the roots of the bigest and eldest leaves, now at length come to be hardned into a stock or trunk; the leaves themselves being commonly thick set with certain long and sharp prickles, of a whitish colour. There are two sorts of them, the wilde, and the garden or planted <HI>Tunall;</HI> both of which beare a fruit, but very different one from the other, both for taste and use. The garden or planted <HI>Tunall,</HI> bears a fruit well esteemed with the Indians for meat, being somewhat bigger than ordinary plums, and ha∣ving many little grains lying in the pulp or substance of it, like figgs, of a white colour, good taste, and no less pleasant than figgs; and beside that, of a delicate sent or smell. The fruit of the wilde <HI>Tunall</HI> is green, growing (as also the other doth) out of the very top of
<PB N="125" REF="72"/>
the leafe, in the fashion of a fig, narrow below or towards the leafe, but upwards growing broad and round, and on the top invironed with a set of thick leaves in fashion of a Crown or Coronet. The pulp of it, or substance with∣in, is juycie and red, but neither pleasing, nor any way commended for the taste, as I ob∣serve: in stains the hands of any that touch it with a deep red or sanguine colour, like Mul∣berries; and which is more than that, the urine of those that eate of it, will seem as if it were all turned into blood; insomuch that some have been much frighted at their first eating thereof, and taken themselves for dead men, finding their urine to be so strangely changed, and not knowing the qualitie of the fruit. Within the Coronet, or circle of leaves, which grow upon the top of the fruit, there are ma∣ny little grains contained, which are the seed of the <HI>Tunall,</HI> and out of which, if they set them, there springs forth a Plant of the same kinde, round-bodied and not unlike to the trunck of other trees, when they first spring out of the ground, which presently spreads it self into leaves growing one out of another suc∣cessively, as the first did. This kinde of <HI>Tunall,</HI> as we said, is not so much regarded for its fruit, but for another commoditie which comes of it,
<PB N="126" REF="73"/>
of far greater profit and advantage than the fruit could be▪ were it much better than it is; <HI>viz.</HI> for the grain, called <HI>Cochinele,</HI> so famous and so much used by the Dyers for the dying of perfect Scarlets, or colours in grain, which is made of this tree in manner as followeth. Upon the leaves of the wilde <HI>Tunall</HI> there groweth usually out certain tuberous or fun∣gous excrescencies, which, in time, turn into a kinde of Insect, or Worme, and multiplyeth so much, that at last all the leaves of the tree, which, as it was said, are very large, and as thick ordinarily as the thumb or finger of a mans hand, seem to be turned into a web of Worms, hanging and interwoven together by the <HI>fibrae,</HI> or little sinews of the leaves. These webs or verminated folio's of the <HI>Tunall,</HI> the Indians husband with a great deal of care and industrie, both while they are a breeding and afterwards, till they be well dryed; at which time making them up into boxes or little casks, they send them into <HI>Spain,</HI> and other parts of the World, as a great and rich Mer∣chandise; which doubtless they are. For 'tis said, they send commonly, one year with ano∣ther, betwixt five and six thousand <HI>Arrobes</HI> of <HI>Cochinele</HI> onely into <HI>Spain</HI> (every <HI>Arrobe</HI> con∣taining five and twenty pound weight at least)
<PB N="127" REF="73"/>
which, according to the usual rate they are sold at, amounts to two hundred eighty three thousand, seven hundred and fiftie <HI>Pezos</HI> by account.</P>
<P N="8">8. Nor may I quite forget the <HI>Hov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or <HI>Hohi,</HI> as some call it; for though it be not a tree that beareth any excellent fruit (for the fruit it beareth is onely a small yellow Plum, of the bigness of a Damosin, and of little sub∣stance or meat, by reason of the greatness of the stone) yet because it gives such a propicious and healthy shade, as they say it doth, so as both Indians and Spaniards seek it out on pur∣pose to rest and sleep under it, it deserves, at least, that I should say what manner of tree it and where it grows. It is of bulk a fair and big tree, the boughs growing▪ chiefly towards the top, thick and spreading; by reason where∣of, as I said, it yeelds as cool a shade as most trees at the <HI>West-Indies</HI> doe; the bark or rinde whereof, being of a more tender and oylie substance, they boyl, and make a lavatory or bath of it, exceeding good and wholsome, especially for the leggs, in case of any extraor∣dinary weakness or weariness, from what cause soever proceeding. It groweth chiefly upon the Streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> but generally in all parts of <HI>Castella del oro,</HI> and not much elsewhere,
<PB N="128" REF="74"/>
and, as they say, hath alwaies a good aire about it. If it be so, it seems given by God, as a re∣medy and reliefe unto the poor people of those hot Countries, who use much to lye abroad and sleep in the fields, against the inconvenien∣ces, which otherwise they might be subject un∣to, by means of another tree, which (as <HI>Oviedo</HI> affirms, but nameth not) grows much in the same parts, of such a pestilent and contagious qualitie, that if a man rest never so little under it, he shall be sure presently to feel some indi∣sposition in himself; and if he stayes or ven∣tures to sleep under it, his head and face will swell, and his eye-lids in a short time be closed up: yet is the tree, to look upon, fair and goodly, of a green flourishing colour, well branched and adorn'd with boughs and thick leaves on all sides, and the fruit it self so pleasing both to the eye and taste, that scarse any man, especially that is a stranger, but would be induced to taste of it; which yet no man can doe without danger, it being of such a noxious qualitie, that of it, together with some other ingredients the Indians of old time were wont to make the poyson, wherewith they in∣venomed their arrows, so mischievously, that 'tis said, scarse one man in fourty that happened to be wounded by them, escaped death. This
<PB N="129" REF="74"/>
tree groweth much upon the gulfe of <HI>Ʋraba,</HI> which lyeth upon the Countrie of <HI>Darien</HI> a∣bovesaid; and mine Author thinks, that if the unhappie fruit which deceived our first parents in Paradise, be to be found on earth, 'tis as like∣ly to be this, as any other he knows.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Cacao,</HI> and the famous drink called <HI>Cho∣colatte,</HI> of <HI>Atolle,</HI> and other drinks used at the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. I Should commit a great oversight, if in treating of the Commodities and Rarities of the <HI>New-World,</HI> I should forget the <HI>Cacao;</HI> which, though it be but a small fruit, or∣dinarily not bigger than an Almond, and hardly of so good a taste; yet because it is so proper to the Countrie, so plentifully there growing, and likewise so much esteemed and used as it is, almost in all kinde of bartery and traffique, I must not altogether omit it. It is a fruit, which with the Americans is almost every thing; it is both meat, drink, and money. It grows upon a small tree of the bigness and fashion of that of the Pome-citron, thriving
<PB N="130" REF="75"/>
best upon hot ground, yet in such places where it is well shadowed from the Sun. There be several kindes of them; and by the description which <HI>Hernandez,</HI> or rather <HI>Antonius Recchius,</HI> makes of the <HI>Cacao,</HI> in his general Historie of American Plants, printed at <HI>Rome</HI> 1651. it seems that <HI>Herrera, Acosta,</HI> and others are not so exact in their report of this fruit, who gene∣rally describe it as a fruit somewhat less than an Almond, whereas <HI>Hernandez,</HI> a Doctor of Physick, and one who lived many yeers in those parts, by command of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> on purpose to observe the Natures of such Plants and Physical rarities as <HI>America</HI> afford∣ed, makes some kindes of <HI>Cacao</HI> to be as big as a good Mellon or Pompion, and none less than the greatest sort of Apples. To reconcile them I suppose we must say, that what <HI>Acosta, Her∣rera,</HI> and others call the <HI>Cacao,</HI> is but the ker∣nel of that <HI>Cacao</HI> which <HI>Hernandez</HI> describeth; and that there grow many of these lesser <HI>Ca∣caos</HI> together, in one common husk, rinde, or shell: which <HI>Hernandez</HI> likewise intimates when he sayes the <HI>Cacao</HI> contains within it <HI>diverse small parts close compacted together,</HI> and afterwards calls that <HI>the seed,</HI> or kernel, <HI>of Cacao,</HI> which the Americans use instead of money, and whereof they make drink, which
<PB N="131" REF="75"/>
is the very <HI>Cacao</HI> that <HI>Acosta</HI> and others onely mention, without taking notice of any other. It is a fruit of a tender and fat substance, of good nourishment, especially roasted, boyled, or any other way dressed: raw, or eaten out of the fruit onely, it causeth, as some say, oppi∣lations and obstructions of the stomach. Yet the Indian women love it extreamly, and think themselves never well but when they are suck∣ing the skin or film of it, which is commonly a white juycie substance, but sometimes red or Murrey, which they finde to be very cooling to them in those hotter Climates, and have an opinion also that it makes them fair. It is a fruit that lasteth long, and impaireth not much by age; in respect whereof, and that it is so generally esteemed there, the Indians com∣monly use it instead of money, as hath been said, buying, or having in exchange for <HI>Cacao</HI> almost every thing in the Market. But the chief reason of its so general esteem and use at the <HI>West-Indies</HI> is, a certain drink they make of it, called <HI>Chocolatte;</HI> which, because it is a liquor that the Americans extreamly love, and that it begins likewise to be cryed up in some parts of <HI>Europe</HI> for an excellent drink (though all men give not the same report of it) I shall relate, as briefly as I can, how they make it, from
<PB N="132" REF="76"/>
the report of a late traveller in those parts.</P>
<P N="2">2. They take a certain quantity of <HI>Cacao</HI> nuts or almonds, as we call them; which, having well dryed, they pound them w<SUP>th</SUP> som cods of <HI>Chili,</HI> or long red Pepper of <HI>America,</HI> a handfull of Anniseed, some quantity of Cinnamon, Cloves, and likewise of white Sugar, till they have brought them all into a soft powder, or paste, which they put up into boxes or tablets of what quantitie and bigness they please, laying it first upon paper within the box, from which, upon occasion, the powder or paste will easily separate; but to any thing that is of earth or wood it sticks fast. They put to it likewise certain grains of <HI>Achiotte,</HI> which is another fruit of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> growing much after the manner of <HI>Cacao, viz.</HI> many grains of it together in one husk or cod, all of them red. This is onely to give the <HI>Cacao</HI> a good colour; and the <HI>Achiotte</HI> is commonly pounded by it self, and sold in boxes, or little round cakes, yet so fine and dry, that it will ea∣sily mix and incorporate it self with the <HI>Cacao,</HI> to give it tincture. The better sort, and they that mean to make the <HI>Chocolatte</HI> rich and very pleasing, add many other ingredients; but these already mentioned are the most com∣monly used; and the <HI>Cacao</HI> thus made up, they
<PB N="133" REF="76"/>
sell usually at four shillings a pound. This is <HI>Chocolatte,</HI> or the confectioned <HI>Cacao.</HI> And as there is difference in the composition of it, so likewise they drink it diverse waies. The richest is that which is used by the Gallants and Ladies at <HI>Mexico, viz.</HI> to drink hot with <HI>Atolle,</HI> after this manner. They dissolve a box or tablet of <HI>Cacao</HI> in some little quantity of pure hot water, standing on the fire; and ha∣ving first with a Molinet, or some other in∣strument, stirred it up, and well mixed the <HI>Cacao</HI> and water together, they put so much of <HI>Atolle</HI> into it, as fills up the Cup or vessell, and so drink it by suppings very hot. This <HI>Atolle</HI> is it self a rich and delicious liquor, of which I shall speak by and by. But the most usual way of drinking it is, to dissolve a box or Tablet of <HI>Cacao</HI> in hot water, and having well sweetned it with Sugar, to drink it with∣out more adoe, onely with some conserves, or Naples-Bisket, either dry or steeped in the <HI>Chocolatte,</HI> as every one please. Sometimes al∣so they dissolve it in cold water, and stir it con∣tinually with a Molinet, til it rise to a scum, or froth, which they take off, and put into some other vessel or cup, and make the other hot; which when they have likewise sweetned with Sugar, they poure out into the vessel,
<PB N="134" REF="77"/>
where the scum or froth is that was first taken off, and so drink them both together. But this way is not held to be so good, as causing ob∣sructions and windiness in the stomach: whereas the effects of <HI>Chocolatte</HI> well tempered and moderately taken, are said to be, that it fortifyeth and comforts the stomach; which at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> in many persons, is fre∣quently subject to a <HI>Cachexia,</HI> or fainting some hours after meale, whether it be from any peculiar indisposition of the Aire or Cli∣mate, or from som natural weaknes and insoli∣dity in the food or dyet of the Countrie; which though it be for the most part luscious tooth∣some and pleasing in the palate, in what kinde soever it be, whether of flesh, fish or fruits, yet is it not held to be of so strong and solid nutri∣ment, as the dyet of <HI>Europe</HI> generally is. It is said likewise to revive and exhilerate the spirits very much, to help concoction, to make lusty and corpulent, and may be well taken three times a day, in the morning, a little before dinner, and some three or four hours after, but very moderately, and never exceeding one reasona∣ble draught at a time: and a if man hath occasi∣on to watch, or sit up late, it will help him very much to take one cup of it more about eight or nine a clock at night.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="135" REF="77"/>3. Now as for <HI>Atolle,</HI> of which I spake even now, it is a drink of it self very delicious, made of the juyce of the young <HI>Maiz,</HI> or Indian Wheat, much like unto Almond milke, but somwhat thicker, and so confectioned with Sugar, Spices, Musk and other ingredients of the Countrie, that it is not onely of Admira∣ble sweetness, both for the taste and smell, but much more nutritive and comfortable to the stomach; and would doubtless be accounted a rare dtink in <HI>Europe,</HI> if it would endure the Sea, or could be transported thence, but that it will not: whereas <HI>Chocolatte,</HI> or <HI>Cacao,</HI> made up in boxes, as we said, is sent abroad into <HI>Spain, Flanders, Italy,</HI> and many other parts of the World. The Commoner sort of Indians have another kinde of drink, which they call <HI>Chica,</HI> a hellish slap, and such, as if it had but some good quantity of Hen-bane ad∣ded to the Toade, which they commonly put into it, and steep him there till he be dead and quite consumed, would be a draught fitter for the Devill than a Christian. They take a great Jarre or vessel of the sort of those which usu∣ally they have from <HI>Spain,</HI> and put in some certain quantity of water, filling up the rest with <HI>Melassos,</HI> or the juyce of Sugar Canes, and sometimes a little Honey: And beside
<PB N="136" REF="78"/>
these, to give it a strength agreeable to their Palats that drink it, they put in good store of the roots and leaves of Tobacco, and of seve∣rall other roots of the Countrie, of strong and violent operation, adding to all, the biggest and blackest toad they can finde: and having so done, they close up the Jarre, and let it stand for the space of three weeks or a moneth, till all the ingredients be throughly steeped and consumed; after which, they drink it. And though, for the most part, at the first opening of the Jarre, it gives a sent that a stranger hath much adoe to indure, yet the Indians love it and drink it excessively, having many great meetings onely to drink <HI>Chica;</HI> and most com∣monly they carowse so long at it, that they are all of them not onely drunk, which is usual with them, but even raging mad with it; in∣somuch that the Spanish Officers and Magi∣strates among them labor what they can to prohibit such meetings, but all in vain; cu∣stome and the naturall inclination of the Americans to drink and swill very much, hi∣therto prevailing against their endeavors. I am not ignorant that some Authors give a better character of a certain drink at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> under the name of <HI>Chica;</HI> nor can I say which of them it is, that hath mistaken the name: This
<PB N="137" REF="78"/>
I am sure, the Author whom I follow, pre∣tends to be an eye witness, and to have seen with his eyes that which he reports of the thing it self, <HI>viz.</HI> the quality of the drink, and manner of drinking it by the Indians: which in truth seems to me to be but a relique of their old barbarity and savageness; and there∣fore I shall speak no more of it.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the aboundance of Cattel at the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> and of several sorts of Beasts and other Creatures, both of Land and Water proper to the <HI>New World.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. I Must for brevities sake, and to com∣ply with the intentions of my friend, who calls for these imperfect Notes with some importunity, pass by many particular things, otherwise not unworthy to be known, in the rank of Trees, Plants, and Fruits; and onely refer the reader, desirous of further satisfaction herein, to the elaborate and choise History of American Plants and rarities, above mentio∣ned, written by <HI>Franciscus Hernandez,</HI> a Spa∣nish Doctor of Physick, augmented and ac∣curately
<PB N="138" REF="79"/>
commented upon by <HI>Nardus Anto∣nius Recchus</HI> and Italian, <HI>Joannes Terrentius,</HI> and others: proceeding my self to give some briefe account concerning the Cattel, and such other Beasts of <HI>America,</HI> as may seem most worthy of our knowledge. We have said be∣fore, that the Cattel of <HI>Europe,</HI> which have been transported thither, have thriven aboun∣dantly, and multiplyed into such incredible numbers, as well Kine or great Cattle, as those of the lesser sort, <HI>viz.</HI> Sheep, Hoggs, Goats, &amp;c. that Swine, and also great Cattel in the Islands, especially of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and in many parts of the Continent beside, live wilde in heards upon the Mountains, and may be killed by any body that will take the pains to doe it. Yea, they say that the very doggs which the Spaniards carried over, and which did them not a little service, when time was, against the naked Indians, have multiplyed so exceedingly, that they goe also in companies, like other wilde Beasts, up and down the Countrie, and are one of the greatest inconveniencies to w<SUP>ch</SUP> the Countrie of <HI>America</HI> is subject, for the mischief that they doe to their Sheep and other small Cattel, being become almost as ravenous and bad as so many Wolves, and seem to be little less than metamorphiz'd into Wolves,
<PB N="139" REF="79"/>
by their wild and mountainous breeding, and by reason of a strange fierceness which they have contracted by such breeding and living. So as the Spaniards that brought them thither, are forced to keep guard, and to maintain, as it were, a <HI>defensive warre</HI> against their own Creatures. Nevertheless in the most inland Countries of <HI>America,</HI> where the Spaniards live and many hundreds of leagues from the Sea, or any part of the Islands, there is so great plenty of flesh-meat, that for a Ryall of plate, which is but six pence English money, a man may buy thirteen or fourteen pound weight of the best Beef, Mutton, or Pork, in the Market, of an <HI>Obligado</HI> (as they call him) or some of his Deputies, who are men appointed and bound, as we said before, to serve such a Citie, Town, or Place, with flesh meat, at a certain rate, all the year long. So that omitting to speak any thing more concerning forein or European Cattel at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> I shall speak onely, and that very briefly, of such Cat∣tel, and other Creatures, as are more proper to the <HI>New World,</HI> seem either most worthy, or most necessary to be known by us; beginning first with those of the Land.</P>
<P N="2">2. And among the Land Creatures of <HI>America,</HI> I suppose the <HI>Pacos,</HI> or Peruvian
<PB N="140" REF="80"/>
Sheep, as they commonly count and call them, may by right come in the first place, being the most profitable Cattel of the Countrie, I had almost said, of the World, affording the In∣dians both meat, clothing, and service. It is a Beast of a reasonable good stature, bigger than a Calfe, and somewhat less than a Bullock of two year old, and bears a burthen, for the most part, of 150 pound weight, without the charge either of saddle or shooing, as both Horse and Mules require, feeding onely upon such meat as they finde upon the roade; and in case they finde none, travelling some dayes without either meat or water. There are two sorts of these <HI>Pacos;</HI> one that bears a good fleece of wooll; the other smooth and bare, yet somewhat the stronger of the two for bur∣then. They have long necks like a Camel, and are of diverse colours, white, black, grey, and spotted. Their flesh is likewise very good meat, especially while they are young, and of their young ones, which is said to be the ten∣derest and most delicate that can be eaten, though they kill not many of them by reason of their necessary service, and so great plenty of other meat. But of their wooll they make se∣veral sorts of cloath; one more gross and com∣mon: the other very fine, which they call
<PB N="141" REF="80"/>
<HI>Cumbi;</HI> and serveth for Carpets, Coverings, and many other uses, lasting long, and having, a good lustre, and (which is somewhat more curious) woven on both sides alike, without difference. They drive these <HI>Pacos</HI> in troops, sometimes four or five hundred of them to∣gether, or more, laden with Merchandise, Wine, <HI>Maiz, Coca,</HI> Quick-silver, and Silver in Barrs, which they carrie from the Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> as far as <HI>Ariqua,</HI> upon the South-Sea, which is about threescore or seventy leagues, without any other Convoy or Guide, but one∣ly of a few Indians to drive the Sheep, and some Spaniards to oversee the Indians. They indure frost and cold naturally, as having been bred, and thriving best upon the <HI>Sierra</HI> and <HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Peru;</HI> where they are seen many times covered with ice and snow, yet never shrinking at it; whereas in the Planes and hot Countrie they dye. They are in truth a ve∣ry serviceable and good Creature, yet not without some odd qualities, which the Reader, must know, especially that sort of them which are smooth and bear no fleece. If they meet a stranger by the way, they will many times sud∣denly stand still, and raising up their long necks as high as they can, stare and gaze upon him so wistly, as will make a man laugh not a little to
<PB N="142" REF="81"/>
see it, and with such a confidence as if he feared nothing; yet all on the sudden a fright takes him, and away he runs with his load upon his back, and commonly so fast that his driver is hardly able to recover him before he hath gained some high rock or Mountain, where the Indian either cannot or dare not follow him for the precipice; and from hence nothing will command him but a Harquebuz, which they are oftentimes forced to use, onely to get the Silver again, that is upon his back. They have likewise another quality not a little trou∣blesome; which is to grow resty, and lye down under their burthens: though this be but sel∣dome, and, as they say, never but when they are laden or driven beyond ordinary. But if the fit once take him, there is no other remedy but to have patience to sit down by him, make on him, and let him take his own time to rise; which, after a while, he will doe of himself: but to stir or strive with him before, is to no purpose; for though you beat him never so much, or kill him, or cut him in a thousand peeces, all will not make him move a foot: but by bearing him company, and treating him fairely, after two or three hours rest he will rise and goe on his journey as willingly as can be. They are commonly estimated at five or
<PB N="143" REF="81"/>
six peeces of <HI>Assay,</HI> which may be about four∣ty shillings English money; and at the Indies he that hath but four or five of these <HI>Pacos</HI> to travel withall &amp; carrie Merchandise from place to place, will not count himself a poor man.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Vicugnes</HI> are a kinde of wilde Goats, but much bigger than the ordinary Goats of <HI>Europe,</HI> and without hornes, otherwise coated and haired like Goats. They live wilde on the mountainous parts of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chile,</HI> being in other parts not so common; and for the most part upon the tops of those highest moun∣tains the <HI>Andes,</HI> nothing offended with the sharpness of the cold or snow. They goe commonly in heards or great companies to∣gether, being exceeding fearfull Creatures, and withall very light of foot. Anciently the hunting of them was forbidden to the common People, and reserved onely to the <HI>Inguas</HI> and Lords of <HI>Peru:</HI> now 'tis generally used, whensoever they are found in the low∣lands. They are of a dark brown colour, not much unlike to dryed Roses, &amp; bear a fleece of a long shaggie haire, yet so fine that the Indians make rugs and coverings of it, of great value. Their flesh is counted the most dainty sort of Venison, and in some cases medicinal: yea the Indians have an opinion that the very Quilts
<PB N="144" REF="82"/>
and Coverings made of the wooll or haire of the <HI>Vicugnes,</HI> are good against the inflammation of the reins, and for the tempering of all ex∣cessive heat; nor is it improbable. For consi∣dering what kinde of Pasturage this beast doth naturally delight in, and for the most part live by, which is more than half frost and snow, it may well be thought, that not only their flesh, but every thing else that proceeds naturally of their substance, should in some degree be re∣frigerative, and retain some cooling vertue in it. Of the flesh there is no dispute to be made, but that it is very soveraign and good in all such cases, <HI>viz.</HI> of inflammations and immode∣rate heat. <HI>Acosta</HI> gives a notable instance of it in himself; who having travelled so long upon the <HI>Andes</HI> and those cold mountains of <HI>Peru,</HI> that his eyes were inflamed with the excessive sharpness of the Aire, and become so painfull to him, that they seemed ready to drop out of his head, onely by rubbing them lightly with a piece of the raw flesh of the <HI>Vicugne,</HI> the pain was presently asswaged, and his eyes in short time reduced to good temper. Nor is this the onely good they have by this Beast; for out of his stomach, when he is kild, they take likewise the Bezar stone, true and good, and scarse any way inferiour to that of the <HI>East-Indies;</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="82"/>
which, as 'tis well known, is a stone of rare vertue, especially in way of Antidote against any sorts of poison, in all pestilential Diseases, and likewise the infirmities of deep Melancho∣lie. They finde it commonly of the bigness of a wallnut; sometimes of an Hens egge, or an Orange; but these are rare.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is also at the <HI>West-Indies</HI> another Beast, which they call <HI>Tarugne,</HI> not much un∣like to the <HI>Vicugne;</HI> but bigger of body, and likewise of a swifter pace. These live not in companies, as the <HI>Vicugnes</HI> doe, but solitary and single, and carrie their eares hanging down, whereas those of the <HI>Vicugne</HI> are erect and stand up: in other respects they much re∣semble the <HI>Vicugne,</HI> yeelding likewise the Be∣zar stone, as the <HI>Vicugne</HI> doth; and which, though it be not altogether so big, yet is thought to be much better in vertue and ope∣ration than the other. There are Bezar stones likewise taken very often out of the <HI>Pacos;</HI> but those are less, not ordinarily above the bigness of an hasell nut, or Filberd; and whe∣ther so perfect and true in kinde, or no, as the other, I cannot say. The <HI>Taurus Mexica∣nus,</HI> as some Authors call him, and we must English, the <HI>American Bull,</HI> or <HI>Steere,</HI> is ano∣ther strange Beast at the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> strange
<PB N="146" REF="83"/>
I call them in respect of our selves, and these parts of the World; for otherwise they are no way strange, being common at <HI>America,</HI> especially in the more Northern parts of it, and of no very monstrous or deformed shape. They resemble the Oxe of <HI>Europe</HI> only a little in the head, and not otherwise; being not only of a far less size than the ordinary Oxe or Bullock, but also of a stature somewhat with the lowest, even in proportion to their own bulke; having a good big full bodie, of the size of some lesser sort of Cows, but very short leggs to bear it; yet we may well count them the natural and proper Kine of <HI>Ameri∣ca.</HI> They are of a bright brown colour, or if you please, of a dark yellow, such as the Itali∣ans call <HI>il colore lionato,</HI> having a thick long hair curled all over their bodie, which at a di∣stance makes them appear somewhat terrible and horrid, but coming neerer them, their countenance seems rather cheerful and plea∣sing; neither have they any truculency or fierceness of condition, but are as tractable and easily maniable as other Cattel. On their backs they have a little rising or bunch, like a Camel, though I doe not observe that they are any where used for burthen, like the Camel. They breed and abound most in the
<PB N="147" REF="83"/>
Province of <HI>Quivira,</HI> which is a plain level Countrie in the Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> affording little else but pasturage; and from hence they are had into other parts, being the cheif wealth of this Countrie, and subsistance of the People; who chiefly live upon this Cattel, feeding huge multitudes of them in Heards up and down the Countrie, as their pasture leads them, using their flesh for meat, which is very good, and making a drink of their blood.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet is their another sort of smal Cattel rec∣koned for Kine at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> which they call <HI>Dantes,</HI> but in their figure and shape more resembling Mules than Kine; neither have they any horns. The hides of these Beasts are much used by the Indians for Jerkins, or a kinde of upper Garment, which is as good as some Ar∣mor for them, it being so thick and hard, as it is said to resist any weapon that the Indians use: like to the <HI>Armadillos</HI> (as the Spaniards call them) which are likewise another kinde of Beasts proper to the <HI>New World,</HI> much lesser than the <HI>Dantes,</HI> yet covered all over the body, as it were, with a Coat of Maile, that is, with a scalie hard skin, which she opens and shuts at pleasure, and thereby both covers and defends her self upon occasion. The flesh of this Beast
<PB N="148" REF="84"/>
is eaten by some, but not so generally com∣mended for good meat. The <HI>Saynos</HI> are a kinde of Hogge or Swine of <HI>America,</HI> a wilde and fierce Creature, and in this respect some∣what more strange, that their Navil is said to be on the midst of their back. They are armed likewise on their feet with talons, so sharp that a Rasor will not pierce faster or further then they, and with them they doe usually teare and wound such as pursue them, very dangerously, especially if they have not good care and skil in hunting them. The flesh of them, when they are taken, is counted good meat; but to keep it, the Navil in the back of it must be taken quickly out, otherwise it will pu∣trifie in a few dayes. The <HI>Chincelles</HI> are a kinde of Squirrel, of a wonderfull soft and smooth hair, the skin whereof is thought to be very comfortable to the stomach in any sudden pain or fainting, and affordeth a delicate kinde of Furre, much used and esteemed by the better sort. The <HI>Viscachas</HI> and <HI>Cuyos</HI> are the Hares and Conies of <HI>America,</HI> of much bigger size than these of <HI>Europe,</HI> and are hunted there likewise for sport, as here, and their flesh counted not the worst sort of Venison. The <HI>Micos,</HI> or Monkies of <HI>America,</HI> are many and of several kindes; some whereof are said
<PB N="149" REF="84"/>
not to be much less than the body of a little man, and also bearded under their chaps as venerably as any Goat. They describe a cer∣tain kinde of them in <HI>Peru</HI> with long tailes, and commonly of thrice the bigness of an or∣dinarie Ape, of diverse colours, <HI>viz.</HI> black, grey, bay, and spotted; and report many pret∣ty stories of them; which, if true, argue them to be extreamly ingenious, and to have, at least, some <HI>traites de visage,</HI> as they say, or resem∣blances of reason. This is common with them; when they have minde to any fruit upon a tree, they get presently up, and winding their taile about the bough, with the weight of their bodie shake as much fruit off it as they think fit. Of another it is said, that seeing a Souldi∣er level at him with his Musket, he snatch't up a stone, and before the Musket could be dis∣charged, threw it at him and hit him full in the eye. <HI>Acosta</HI> tells of another, which they com∣monly sent to the Tavern for wine, the pot in one hand and money in the other; which er∣rand he would perform most exactly, and with such discretion, that they must be very rude with him, that should get the money out of the one hand, before his pot were filled and put into the other. The Boys in the street would throw stones at him many times in
<PB N="150" REF="85"/>
sport, and he at them again, but never till he had first set down his pot; then he would lay about him with any thing next hand; nor would he offer to take up his pot again, till they seem∣ed to be quiet, and that his way was cleer: and if they gave it him, he would drink wine freely; but otherwise not so much as touch it. There be also Lyons, Bears, Tygres, and other wilde Beasts of prey at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> but neither so great, nor so ravenous as those in other parts of the World. The Lyons in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> are rather grey than red or yellow, and have not that long shaggie haire on the fore-parts of their bodie, with which they are paint∣ed. The Tygres are more fierce and cruel; but that is only when they are hungry, and seek their prey: for otherwise, <HI>viz.</HI> when their bel∣lies are full, if the report of <HI>Maffaeus</HI> be true in his <HI>historia Indica,</HI> they are as fluggish and heavie a Beast as any, and may be both taken and killed by any body almost that will: But by his favour I will not be the first that shall make tryal. There is likewise aboundance of Staggs and wild Deer in all parts of the Con∣tinent of <HI>America;</HI> but, for ought I know, in the Islands there are none found.</P>
<P N="6">6. These are all Beasts and Creatures of the Land, with which, and infinite others, not
<PB N="151" REF="85"/>
here to be mentioned, the <HI>New World</HI> is aboun∣dantly stored: Nor doe the Waters afford less variety, either of Sea, or more within Land, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Lakes and Rivers, which are generally so plentifully and well stored with good fish, that there is no Countrie in the World comparable to <HI>America</HI> in that respect. Amongst these the <HI>Cayman,</HI> as they call him, or Indian Crocodile, as the most prodigious and strange, deserves to be first mentioned: yet is he an amphibious Creature, living as well, and perhaps as much upon Land as in the wa∣ter. It is a most fierce and ravenous Creature, of a vast bulk or bigness, being said to be from the fore part of his snout to the end of his tayle seven or eight yards long; and of such strength, that he hath been seen to take up a living man, lying asleep upon the shore, in his mouth, and to carry him cleer away with him into the water, over to another Island or Rock in the Sea, where he meant to have devoured him: But being shot with a Caliver he lost his prey, and the man was recovered, but dyed soon after. He seeks his prey commonly upon Land, which he kills or drowns in the Water: yet cannot there eat it, by reason of some pe∣culiar disposition of his throat or gullet, which is such, as that it permits him not to swal∣low
<PB N="152" REF="86"/>
any thing in the water, but with hazard to suffocate or drown himself. The best is, his motion by Land is but slow, and his body so unweldy, that he cannot turn himself but with much adoe, nor his head to either side without turning his whole body. Yet doe they much mischief, especially about some Rivers in the Provinces of <HI>Mechoacan</HI> and <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> where there are many of them. They say 'tis excellent sport to see a <HI>Cayman</HI> and a Tygre fight, as they happen to doe oftentimes, endeavouring to prey one upon another. The <HI>Cayman,</HI> with his taile, cruelly beats and jerks the Tygre, endeavouring what he can to hale him into the water. The Tygre as stoutly resists him with his paw, and labours to pull up the <HI>Cayman</HI> to land; which for the most part he doth, and then opens him by the belly, which is the only part of him where he can be pier∣ced; his whole body otherwise being armed with scales so extremely hard and thick set, that no Lance, and scarcely an Harquebuz or Musket shot will enter it. The Indians fear him not so much by water as land: for being themselves excellent Swimmers and Dyvers, and the <HI>Cayman</HI> alwaies swimming above water, or very fleet, they make no great matter to encounter him hand to hand in his own
<PB N="153" REF="86"/>
element for they easily get under his belly, and with their knives or short Lances pierce him there as they list, and so bring him to Land.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Tyburons</HI> are a kinde of Shark-fish, of large size, and extremely ravenous. They are commonly ten or twelve foot long, and about six or seven spans broad on the back, being fashioned like a Soale, with huge wide mouths, and two rows of teeth on each side of their mouth very sharp and thick set, and of so great strength, that at one snatch or jerk, they will break the bones or pluck asunder the joints of any Beast whatsoever: They follow the ships at Sea willingly, for the wash and other stuff which the Mariners cast out to them, being so ravenous that they re∣ceive everything. <HI>Acosta</HI> reporteth, that out of the gullet of one of them, he saw taken at the same time a great Butchers knife, a long iron hook, and a piece of a Cows head, with one horn still growing upon it. Others tell of Hats, whole Shirts, Leggs and Arms of Men, ropes ends, with many other things of like na∣ture found in the same manner. Yet is the flesh of them counted very good meat, when they are well dryed, and a principall reliefe in ma∣ny occasions at Sea; where they are taken without much difficultie, and so bigge, that
<PB N="154" REF="87"/>
many times ten or twelve men have somewhat to doe to pull one of them up, when they have him upon the hook. They come likewise out of the Sea up into the rivers, as the <HI>Caymans</HI> doe, and are exceeding dangerous both to men and cattell, that are not aware of them, or happen to ly or sleep upon the banks of any great river, as in <HI>America</HI> it is not unusuall to doe. At Sea they are commonly attended by a smaller sort of fish which they call <HI>Rambos,</HI> which lives by the meat that falls from the <HI>Tyburon,</HI> as the <HI>Jaccall</HI> is said to doe by the Lion.</P>
<P N="8">8. The <HI>Manati,</HI> or <HI>Oxe-fish,</HI> as some call them, is another great fish of the Sea, bigger by farre than the <HI>Tyburon,</HI> headed like an Oxe or young heifer, with two armes, or at least stumpes of armes on each side before, and those as some say, distinguished into severall joynts with nailes upon them, not unlike to those of a mans hand. This is a gentle and harmeless creature, and though of bulk or body not less than a young Oxe or Bullock, yet neither of any feirce or horrid aspect, but rather amiable and cleerer countenanced, as the figure of it in <HI>Hernandez,</HI> and <HI>Laet</HI> sheweth. It cometh fre∣quently upon land, and feeds upon hearbs or grasse, if there be any neer; and being at Sea it swimes commonly above water and is easily
<PB N="155" REF="87"/>
taken. 'Tis counted for meat the best fish in the World, being as tender and delicate as any veale, or the best young porke; and so like it, that a stranger would verily take it for veale, which it resembles so much every way, both for colour and taste, that it hath been disputed and questioned by some whither it might be eaten on fasting dayes; for that it both eateth hearbs and grasse, resembles flesh so much, and bea∣reth its young alive, suckling them with milk by certain teats which they have, as other Land creatures doe. They finde in the head of it a certain Stone, or hard congelated Sub∣stance, which being ground to powder, they say is very good for the stone in the reins, and to provoke urine, especially that which is found in the male-fish.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Tortoise</HI> is a Fish yet greater than any of these before spoken of, <HI>viz.</HI> than the <HI>Tybu∣ron</HI> or the <HI>Manati,</HI> and upon the Shores of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> every where, there are great multi∣tudes of them found. These are a Shell-fish of figure and shape round, carrying their house or cover, alwayes upon their back, and by con∣sequence moving but slowly. They take them sometimes at Sea with Nets made for that pur∣pose only, but most commonly on the Shore, whither they frequently resort in huge multi∣tudes,
<PB N="156" REF="88"/>
cheifly to lay their egges, which in the sand are hatched with incredible increase, onely by the heat of the Sun: and though they make all the haste they can to Sea again, assoon as ever they perceive any body, yet they are easily overtaken, and by turning them with a staffe or pole, upon their backs, which is not hard for them to doe that are acquainted with the manner of hunting <HI>Tortoises;</HI> two or three men will stay and take a whole company of them. They are commonly a yard and a quar∣ter at least in length, and sometime more than twice so much in breadth, and of such bigness &amp; weight, that it will ordinarily require six or se∣ven stout men to draw one of them out of the water; and scarce any found so little, but it will lode two or three men to carry it hand∣somely away when it is cut in pieces. The flesh of them is very excellent good meat, when it is well powdred, and of no lesse pleasant taste. E∣very <HI>Tortoise</HI> layeth commonly two or three hundred egges at a time, as big as Hens egges, but round like a ball: good likewise to eate, and have this propertie, that whither boiled or rosted, the white of them is alwaies soft. When the young ones are hatcht, they naturally make to Sea, never expecting that the old one should come to feed them. To this the Tyde helps
<PB N="157" REF="88"/>
them very much, and there they live and thrive so well, that, as they say, some one of them hath been found of that bigness and weight, that 20. men had much adoe to lift it from the ground.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is, besides these, infinite variety of other kindes of fish in the Indian or American Seas; as the <HI>Iguana,</HI> which is a kinde of wa∣ter-Serpent, of somewhat a terrible and ugly forme, but otherwise not at all hurtfull; of the bigness commonly of an Otter or Fox, the skyn spotted and smooth, and the flesh neither unwholesome nor unpleasant meat. And the <HI>Bobo,</HI> which is a gallant fish as any belong to the Seas, of the length of a mans arme, having one only bone or gristly substance running through the midst of it from end to end: it is of a most tender and delicate substance, white as milk, and as fat as butter; excellent meat which way soever dressed, boyl'd, bak'd, stew'd, roasted, or otherwise: And beside these many others, which I must necessarily pass over in silence; as likewise I might well doe these that follow, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Niguas</HI> (as the Spaniards call them) or West-Indian Nits; and the <HI>Broma,</HI> or water-worme, two little Insects indeed, and hardly to be numbred in the rank of perfect Creatures, yet such as make themselves con∣siderable enough to be named, only by their
<PB N="158" REF="89"/>
troublesomness; the one to Men at Land, the other to the ships at Seas. The <HI>Niguas</HI> are so small a kinde of vermine, that they can hardly be perceived single, nothing neer so bigge as a Flea, which lodge themselves insensibly and unperceived at first, under the nails of Mens fingers and toes, and in other private parts of the body, and multiply in a short time so strangely, that they turn the party to extream pain and torture, and not seldome cause him to lose a joint either of his hands or feet: Nor is it easie to prevent their breeding, without continuall brushing of cloaths and a great care to keep all things about a man, as much as can be, clean and dry. When they are perceived to be bred, the best remedy is counted to be, to pour melted wax upon the place where they are nestled; which, though it scalds and be troublesome for the time, yet when it is cold, it brings away a shoale of that little vermin with it, sometimes four or five hundred of them at a pull. A cheap remedy indeed, if it be so effectual as they say. The <HI>Broma,</HI> or water-worm, is no less troublesome and mischievous to the ships at Sea: it is found generally in all parts within the Tropiques or Torrid Zone, and more especially neer the Line: The English call it sometimes <HI>Arters,</HI> from what ground
<PB N="159" REF="89"/>
I am not able to say; but the inconvenience and danger which it brings to ships, if not pre∣vented, is apparent and great. They fasten commonly in such great multitudes, upon the planks of a ship, especially betwixt winde and water, where it is not less dangerous, that the ships many times are found covered with them very thick in those parts, and the planks under water wrought like Hony-combs, full of a num∣ber of little cells or cavities, which the worms make in them, and in time eate through the planks, be they never so thick, and endanger the ship. They are at first as little as a pins head or less, but grow in time to the bigness of a Mans little finger; and the further they work into a plank, the bigger likewise they grow. And therefore to prevent the inconveniences that would otherwise certainly befall the ships that goe to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> they usually sheath them, as they call it, before they goe out, that is, they naile or fasten upon the ribs of the ships, under water, and betwixt winde and water sometimes thin sheats of lead, some∣times double planks of good thickness, both within and without. But neither of these wayes are counted good; partly by reason of the overmuch weight or ballast, which they give to the ship; and partly for that they en∣dure
<PB N="160" REF="90"/>
not; for the worm easily works through the planks, be they never so thick; and the lead being very thin, washeth away, and in time decayes so much, that the worm will not be hindred from entring. Others burn the outermost planks of the ship, under wa∣ter and above, to the blackness of a coal, and then pitch it all over with pitch: This doth reasonable well. But the best remedie of all, and that which is now most generally used, is that which is said to be the Invention of Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> a Gentleman in his time of great experience and command at Sea. They take the sheathing-board, which they intend to lay on, and besmeare all the inside of it with Tarre, half a finger thick at least, and upon the Tarre another half finger thick of hair, such as is commonly used in Morter; and then nayle it down on the ribs of the ship, so far as they judge it necessary, driving the nails reasonably thick, never above a span distance one from another. This is thought both the cheapest and securest way: For the Tarre either killeth the worm, as some think; or at least, when she is wrought through the sheathing-board, the Tarre and hair together so involve and choak her up, that she is not able to pass fur∣ther, but there stops and dyeth: And the
<PB N="161" REF="90"/>
thinner the sheathing-board is, so much the better.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Sugar-Canes, Cotton-wooll, Mulberry trees, and Silk-worms, at the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. AMong the Commodities of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> which we call Mercantile, or such as the Merchants bring from thence, the Sugars are not to be esteemed the least, whether we regard the aboundance, or great plenty of the Commoditie it self that is brought, or the extraordinary gain and profit they make that bring it; it being become such a general instrument of deliciousness to all sorts of People, in all Nations, and so exceed∣ingly agreeable to dainty palats. 'Tis said, they buy a pound of good Sugar at the Indies for five or six Maravedes, which make not two pence of English monie; and in some places a hundred pound weight together for nine or ten Ryals of plate, which are not above five shillings; whereas with us in <HI>Europe,</HI> the rate of it is far otherwise. Some say it is no
<PB N="162" REF="91"/>
Plant of the natural growth of <HI>America,</HI> but brought thither from other parts, as namely from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> or <HI>Canarie</HI> Islands; which seems rather to be a mistake, conside∣ring the great aboundance thereof which groweth naturally, without any kinde of plant∣ing or Husbandrie, in all parts of <HI>Brasil, Para∣guay, Tucuman,</HI> and diverse other Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> both of the Continent and Islands; insomuch that in some place about the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> they report, that the Canes grow to the height of some lesser trees, yeelding a pro∣portionable quantity of good Sugar in every joint or knot of the Cane. For originally, and at first, we must know, this delicious powder, which we call Sugar, is nothing else but the pith or sweet marrow of a certain Cane or Reed, which the Latins call <HI>Saccharum,</HI> bor∣rowing the term, as 'tis thought, from the Arabicks, together with the first knowledge of the Plant, and we commonly the <HI>Sugar-Cane.</HI> It groweth in the manner of other reeds up into a long stalk, with joynts and knots in it, commonly seven or eight foot high, and where the Soile is lusty and proper for it some∣times more; of the bigness of a Mans arme in the brawn, and sharping up towards the top as it groweth. The joints, or knots, of the
<PB N="163" REF="91"/>
Cane, are, for the most part, three or four in∣ches distant one from another, and within full of a spongeous and sweet juycie substance or marrow, of which the Sugar (as we have it) is made. At every knot or joynt of the Cane, on each side, there groweth up a long leafe, sharp at the point, and in the fashion of a wing. The root of it is likewise long and large, and runneth not directly downward into the earth, but rather sloping, and creeping along under the uppermost crust of the ground; out of which at several places there sprout diverse young Siens, or little Plants, which they cut away, both that they should not draw too much of the nutriment from the principal or mother-Plant, as also for that they set them for increase, or a new stock of reeds; And 'tis said to be a yeer and half commonly before a Plant of the Sugar-Cane comes to its full per∣fection or growth. But I conceive that to be much according to the nature and condition of the Soile where they grow. For in <HI>Hispa∣niola</HI> (where indeed the Soile is exceeding lusty and good) 'tis said they grow to a cubits height in less than two moneths space. The substance of the root is likewise very sweet and pleasant, nothing so hard or woody as the roots of some other Canes and Reeds be, but rather
<PB N="164" REF="92"/>
tender and soft; and where the Soile is good and proper for them, one root will beare some∣times twenty or thirty Canes; which in the Island of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> is not unusual; but they never suffer all of them to grow up for the reason abovesaid. They grow both in the Plains and Hill Countrie. in a hot and moist Soile, and require extraordinary Husbanding, and especially that the ground about them be kept clean, and free from annoyance either of weeds or any thing else.</P>
<P N="2">2. The manner of making the Sugar, is commonly thus. When the Reeds are full grown &amp; gathered, they cut or chop them into small peeces at first with a knife, or some other fitting instrument, and afterwards grinde, or break them into yet smaller, in certain huge <HI>Querns</HI> or Mills, which they have for that purpose. These <HI>Querns</HI> goe sometimes with wheels, and are turned about by their Slaves, who tread and labour in them just in the same manner as the Turn-spit Doggs doe in many places in <HI>England:</HI> Others there be that are drawn about with an Horse, or <HI>Bufalo:</HI> But the more general way now used of late for grinding and bruising the Canes, is by water-Mills, which they finde to be far more quick and convenient, especially where they have the
<PB N="165" REF="92"/>
opportunity of a good stream. When the Cane is thus broken and pulverizated in some sort, they put it in great Caldrons, or boyling vessels of Brass, with some quantity of pure water, and likewise a strong lye, or water of ashes made for that purpose; and so boyle it, till all the sweetness be quite out of the Cane, or hard substance of the Reed, and transfused into the liquor. When this is done, they take it out, and through a colatorie or strayner they press out the liquor into certain great Keelers, or vessels which they call <HI>Tangue;</HI> and afterwards boyle it again, with a less pro∣portion of lye put to it: the effect of this lye is chiefly to raise the scum, and thereby to help to clarifie and refine the Sugar, by separating of the sediments and grosser parts of it from the pure. When they have boyled it to the consistency or thickness of Honey, they strain it out again into other vessels, which they call <HI>Tachas,</HI> and boyl it again to a yet greater thickness and consistencie, ever adding some quantitie of the aforesaid lye, and continually stirring and scumming it, as it boyleth. After this they take it out, and set it to cool in cer∣tain lesser vessels which the Spaniards call <HI>Formae,</HI> or Plates, which contain not above the quantity of two or three pound weight of
<PB N="166" REF="93"/>
Sugar a piece. They are commonly made of earth, and perforated, or full of little holes at the bottom, through which the thinner or more liquid part of the Sugar droppeth into other vessels appointed to receive it. It stand∣eth commonly in these <HI>Formes</HI> or Plates about eight or ten dayes, both that it may be perfect∣ly cooled, as likewise to observe whether it be refined and purged of its sediments so fully as it ought: If it be not, they boyle it once again as before. When it is cold, it look∣eth like sand, or small gravel of a dark brown∣ish colour, only it is softer in the hand, and crumbles not so harshly as sand doth. The way to make it white, is by a certain peculiar earth, or <HI>Marle,</HI> they use, which, being first dissolved in water, and wrought into a kinde of soft clay; they spread it upon the Sugar, as it lyeth in the <HI>Formes</HI> or Plates, and in time it brings it to a white colour, yet more or less perfect, according as the Sugar it self is pure and fine. And now it is fit for the Merchants, who transport it into all parts of <HI>Europe:</HI> where, by the Sugar-bakers Art and skill, it is yet more accurately purged and refined: but of this I cannot say much. It is a Merchan∣dise of incredible wealth and advantage to the Countrie; it being no unusual thing for
<PB N="167" REF="93"/>
some one Sugar-Mill, or <HI>Ingenio,</HI> as they call it, to afford a revenue of thirty or fourty thousand <HI>Pezos</HI> every yeer: and though it be likewise brought from the <HI>East-Indies, China,</HI> and other parts, yet is it not more plentifull in any Countrie of the World, than in <HI>America,</HI> where the Cane grows and thriveth well in all Provinces generally, but most kindly in hot and moist Countries; insomuch that in some of the Islands they count an <HI>Ingenio,</HI> or good Sugar-Farm, to be no less profitable than some of their mines of Gold and Silver. 'Tis said, that out of the only Island of Saint <HI>Domingo,</HI> or <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> they transport commonly one year with another, about a thousand chests of refined Sugar, beside that of the courser sort; every chest containing eight or ten <HI>Arrobes</HI> at least, which is twenty five pound weight, according to English account, and likewise proportionably from other parts.</P>
<P N="3">3. Cotton-wooll (as they call it, from the likeness it hath to our ordinary wooll of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> especially as to matter of use) is another very profitable and good commoditie of the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> Though we call it wooll yet, is it the fruit of a tree, at least of a shrub or lesser Plant, and groweth upon it in the manner of Apples or other fruit. It groweth, as I said,
<PB N="168" REF="94"/>
sometimes upon trees, as particularly in the Island of <HI>Puna</HI> in the South Sea, and in <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI> but for the most part upon certain lesser shrubs or Plants, not much above a cubit high from the ground, or at most not above the height of a man at the middle. The substance of the Plant whereon it groweth, is very hard and wooddie, and no less thick set with sprigs and branches growing out of it from below, or but little above ground; which, in time are all beautified and covered, as it were, with a purple colour'd flower, yet about the edges, and below at the stalk, yellow; after which ap∣pears the fruit in a round cod or hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, of dif∣ferent bigness, according as the Soile is good and proper. If the Soile be warm and very lusty, they are commonly of the bigness of or∣dinary Apples, or Quinces; if otherwise, less: When the fruit is ripe, the cod opens of it self, dividing into four quarters, and the matter within it appears; which is nothing else but a soft gentle substance, much resembling wooll in the touch, lying close, and well wrapt to∣gether in the cod: it groweth still, that is, after the cod is opened, to the bigness of a mans fist ordinarily, and then, unless it be ga∣thered by some body, it sheds it self upon the ground, as the Down-Thistle commonly doth,
<PB N="169" REF="94"/>
together with its seed, which is a little round black substance of the bigness of Conies tret∣tles, or some lesser sort of Pease, but flat. This is the seed of the Cotton; and they gather it constantly, and sow it every year, in the same manner as they doe other Grain, <HI>viz.</HI> upon tilled Land, and in furrows; and in harvest they reap their crop, which they have never above once upon the same stalk or Plant.</P>
<P N="4">4. This woolly substance of the Cotton-Apple, when it is gathered, the Indian women card and spin, as we doe our ordinary wooll in <HI>Europe;</HI> and there are both stuffs and cloth made of it of several sorts and in great aboun∣dance; some very fine, like silk; others less fine: and of the coursest sort of all they make Sails for ships, coverings for their Tents in the field, either when they are marching against an enemy, or following their Heards of Cattel to pasture, and in many other such like occa∣sions. And 'tis commonly the womans work, not onely to card and spin, but also to weave this cotton into cloath, especially one sort of it, <HI>viz.</HI> of which they make their <HI>Inni's,</HI> as they call them, which are certain hanging Beds, much used by the American People, both at <HI>Mexico</HI> and in all the Northern parts, and
<PB N="170" REF="95"/>
likewise in <HI>Peru.</HI> These are webs of a good strong sort of Cotton Cloath, woven about eight or nine foot long, and an ell broad, with loop-holes at each end; through which, by putting a cord or some small line, they hang them up in their houses upon beams or tain∣ters made for that purpose; and when they are abroad in the fields, or hunting in the woods, upon the boughs of trees, or any other thing they finde convenient. They use them chiefly in the field, and when they march a∣gainst their enemies; for they are not very troublesome to carrie, and are much more convenient and healthfull, either to sleep in, or lie upon, than the bare ground, especially in those Countries, and in the night time: And when they are foul, they make a lye of a certain great <HI>Cucumer</HI> or <HI>Gourd</HI> cut in pieces and steept a good while in water, and after∣wards boyled; with which they scowre and bring them to as perfect whiteness, as any Soap or Fullers-earth would be able to doe.</P>
<P N="5">5. And because the Silks, Taffaties, Sattins, and other fine Draperie of <HI>America,</HI> are not only as good for the most part as those of the Eastern parts, but begin also now to be as great a Merchandise, both from <HI>Mexico</HI> and
<PB N="171" REF="95"/>
<HI>Peru;</HI> and for that the Countrie affordeth such good plenty of Mulberrie trees, both planted and naturally growing (the leaves whereof are the most proper and kindely su∣stenance of the Worm, which breeds and makes the Silk) I must not pass it over without some short touch at least upon this subject, <HI>viz.</HI> of the nature of Silk it self, and especially of that admirable Creature <HI>the Silk-Worm,</HI> which breeds it. Silk originally is nothing else but a fine thred spun out of the bowels of a certain Worm, which the Latins call <HI>Bom∣byx,</HI> we in English cōmonly <HI>the Silk Worm;</HI> in same the manner as the common Spider weaves his dusky, yet curious web, out of himself. The Worm at the Indies is of the bigness of a Mans finger or thumb, somewhat greater than those of <HI>Italy</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and is bred two manner of waies: that is to say, by putrefaction, as other Insects commonly are, and also by a more proper and specifical generation. The first is, according to the re∣port of <HI>Pliny</HI> in his <HI>Naturall History,</HI> of the Flowers of the Cypress and Turpentine trees, and likewise many times of the Ash and Oake, which, in time of year, either fall from the trees of themselves, or else are beaten off with rain-showers; out of which leaves corrupted and
<PB N="172" REF="96"/>
putrified upon the ground, there is soon after, by the heat of the Sun and the exhalations or vapours that issue out of the earth, a certain Insect ingendred, of the bigness of a Butter flie, naked and smooth at first, like a Worm; but, in time, coming to be over-grown with a kinde of hair, and after that with a thicker and warmer coat, which, against winter, the Insect works for it self out of the Cotton, or downy fillets of those leaves among which it was bred, or can otherwise come by. Their other man∣ner of breeding is by generation properly so called, that is, by coupling of Sexes: for there is both Male and Female of them. The man∣ner thus. The Silk-worm, after he hath wrought up his bagge, or ball of silk to the full, soon after dyeth within it; and though he leaves but a poor <HI>Skeleton</HI> or thin <HI>corps</HI> be∣hinde him; yet out of it, laid in some close subterraneous room, where no winde cometh, in a few dayes after it is putrified, there springs a pair of other Insects or worms of the same kinde, though not altogether of the same fi∣gure or shape; for they are both horned and winged. These the Latins call <HI>Chrysalides,</HI> and seem to be made only for generation, or preserving the kinde: for as much as they doe nothing else but gender for the space of three
<PB N="173" REF="96"/>
or four dayes together; at the end whereof the Male dieth, leaving the Female behinde him impregnated and big with a numerous issue of little egges, to the number of one hundred sometimes or more, of the bigness of Millet seeds, or some other smaller sort of grain; of which assoon as she is delivered, she likewise followeth the Male, and dyeth.</P>
<P N="6">6. Out of these eggs (for so the Authors perpetually call them) a new Breed or Stock of wormes, is to be gotten, which is the second manner of their breeding, as hath been said; neither is it the least part of the care and skill of those that keep Silke-wormes, and trade in the making of Silk, to hatch them well: the best way whereof, and most commonly used in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other parts, is said to be the naturall heat of a woman, either in bed, or otherwise carrying them about her, in her bosome be∣twixt her breasts; especially if she be a woman of good complexion, or a Virgin: and so they are hatched commonly in three or four dayes. They keep the eggs all Winter long for the most part, and without any great inconveni∣ence, not thinking of hatching them, till the Mulberie-trees be well blosom'd, the leaves whereof are their most naturall food, and are seldome out before the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> or
<PB N="174" REF="97"/>
beginning of <HI>June.</HI> When the eggs are hatch't, and the worm appeares, the next care is to procure it sustenance, whereby it may grow to a bigness, and strength able to work. Their best meat, as I said, is the Mulbury leaves; for though they feed them sometimes with the leaves of <HI>Rubus,</HI> or the great Bramble, with Lettice, and likwise with Nettle-leaves; yet neither doe they thrive so well, nor weave so bigge a web, as they doe, when they are fed with the Mulberry-leaf. They feed with a great appetite, assoone as ever they are bred, eating constantly thrice a day, <HI>viz.</HI> at Morning, Noon, and Night, when they are young; and when they are grown to some bigness, five or six times every day. After they have fed well for the space of nine or ten dayes together, and their bellies are full, they are taken with a kinde of dead sleep: which holds them for the most part three or four dayes together: and though it be a sicknesse and some weakning to them, yet they awake of themselves, and in time by good handling seem to be revived with it, and fall to feeding afresh. And this they doe constantly, that is, feed, sleep, and revive a∣gain, three severall times at least before they come to their full strength, or to be able to weave: which is commonly about fourty or
<PB N="175" REF="97"/>
fifty dayes after their first birth. When they have had their last and longest sleep; for the space of eight or ten dayes together afterwards they feed the stoutliest of all, and then quite give over; which they that keep them percei∣ving, know that now their belly is full, and that they are ready to worke out all again that they have hitherto eaten, with the advantage of a rare interest beside. They know it also by this, that the bagge of Silk, that is to say, the matter out of which the Worme afterward spins the Silk, begins to appeare, and to shine through the lawn coverture or thin sides of the worm. Against which time they that look to their working, have alwayes in readiness some boughs or branches of the Oke, Chesnut, or any other tree, whose substance is very hard and dry: for upon such they alwayes work best; any degree of moistness, how little so∣ever, whither of the aire, or in their Loomes, or otherwise, being counted very prejudiciall both to the Worm and web. Upon these boughs they lay the Wormes, which presently fall to work and spinning of their thred from one twig to another, backward, forward and athwart, as themselves please, alwaies wor∣king inward, that is from the circumference to the center or middle part, till at last they have
<PB N="176" REF="98"/>
spun out a round bag of Silk, for the most part of an Ovil or oblong figure, in which last of all they close up themselves; yet still continuing to work, till they have either wholly or well nigh filled up the bag within, and that the bot∣tome within themselves, <HI>viz.</HI> within their bow∣ells, and out of which they spin, be quite spent and unravelled. The bag, or web which these Silk-wormes spin is many times as big as a mans head all of one thred, so fine, that it can hardly be discerned, but by very good eyes, and spun out so long without any rupture or once breaking off, that, as <HI>Aldrovandus</HI> affirmeth, some one, of them might be able to circle about the biggest City in <HI>Italy.</HI> The colour of it is different, white, yellow, green; or otherwise, according either to the nature of the Climate and Country where they work, or to the qua∣lity of the food, with which the wormes are fed. This spinning holds them conmonly nine or ten dayes. When all is done, and they are come, as it were, to the last thred of the Clue, and that the Worme, by filling up the bottome of the bag, hath quite emptied her self, in a short time she dies, as we said before, in the midst of her self made prison and work: and there spring out of her <HI>Skeleton,</HI> after some few days, two other lesser Wormes, of the same
<PB N="177" REF="98"/>
kinde, though differing somewhat in shape and figure; whose business is onely to propagate, as we likewise said; and that being done they die: and the Silk-masters unravelling again the whole web, or bag of silk, which the dead Ar∣tist hath wrought, order it according to their own skill, as may be most fit for the Merchant; of which I can say but little.</P>
<P N="7">7. This is the generation of Silk-wormes, which as briefly as I could, I have described from the report of divers Authors; especially of <HI>Hieronimus Vida</HI> his curious and elegant poem of this subject intituled <HI>de Bombyce:</HI> and this is the originall and first ground of Silk, that so rare and so much esteemed vesture: it is but the entrayles of a Worme, an effect of putri∣faction and rottenness: which if the Gallants and Ladies of the world, when they ruffle most in it, would be pleas'd a little to reflect upon, perhaps it would doe them no harm; and be a means, that while it renders their outward personages comely and fine, as it doth, it should not put their inward and better part so much out of fashion.</P>
<P N="8">8. As for the Mulberry trees, the leaves whereof are said to be the most naturall and kindely sustenance that can be for the Silk-wormes, I have not much to say of them; only
<PB N="178" REF="99"/>
this. They are Trees of somewhat a larger size than ordinary, of a great body or trunk and also of high growth. They beare their fruit in clusters like grapes, being indeed nothing else but a multitude of small berries growing together upon one long bunch, just as grapes doe. The leaves are broad and somewhat thick, of a very green colour, and sharpening to∣wards the end in fashion of a heart seeming to be snipt or cut round about the edges with little gashes, more or less deep, according to the kinde of the Mulberry: for there are two sorts of them, <HI>viz</HI> the black &amp; the white; so cal∣ed from the colour of the fruit which they bear: the first whereof, when ripe is outward∣ly black, but the pulpe of it, or jucy substance within red or of a deep murry; the other white and of a more pleasant tast, something resem∣bling wine. They grow best in hot Countries: and where they make Silk, there are whole Woods and Groves of them, made or preser∣ved on purpose, onely for the Silk-wormes to feed on. Of all the Trees of the Garden it is counted to be the last that putteth forth its blossomes; which it never doth till about the end of <HI>May,</HI> or beginning of <HI>June,</HI> when all the cold weather is gone: and till then the Silk-wormes also, where they breed naturally and
<PB N="179" REF="99"/>
not by the art and care of man, lye dead like so many little grains or seeds, or like the dung∣ing of flesh-flies, upon the ground; but after that time begin to revive and shew themselves; as if there were some naturall sympathy and correspondence betwixt the one and the other. They grow either naturally of a slip of their own kinde, or by the inoculation or grafting upon some other Trees: and the white Mul∣berry is commonly a graft upon that which is called the white Poplar. There are good store of them said to be at <HI>Bermudaz, Virginia,</HI> and some other English Plantations; which, if the Planters had Skill, or were enjoyned to mind the business, might in time afford great plen∣ty of Silks, and a richer trade and employment than any other Commodity they yet deale in. But they think not of it; and therefore it may well suffice to have spoken thus much of the business.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the abundance and excellency of the Metals at the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> especially of Gold and Silver.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AMerica</HI> or the <HI>New World,</HI> is doubtless a Country admirable rich, &amp; which the Soveraign Creator of all things hath plentifully stored with all sorts of the most excellent and rare endowments of nature, as well in the rank and order of things inanimate or without life, as of living creatures; according as in part wee have seen allready, and may be more large∣ly and to admiration observed, as the scattered instances or tokens of his Divine Magnificence and bounty, in all the Histories and reports of the Country. But of that wherein it seemes most of all to excell, wee have yet spoken no∣thing <HI>viz.</HI> of the Metals, which alone were able to render it the most desirable part of the World, though it had no other advanta∣ges. It aboundeth with all sorts of these, <HI>viz.</HI> Iron, Brass, Copper, Lead, Tin, &amp;c. But the excellency and richness of the other two, <HI>viz.</HI> Gold and Silver, and likewise of that which is as it were, the Sperm and Solder of these, and
<PB N="181" REF="100"/>
of all other Metals beside, <HI>viz.</HI> Quicksilver, is such, that it makes all the rest to be neither much spoken of, nor much sought after in these parts. In which respect I conceive I may be more easily excused, if I pass them over likewise in silence, and make <HI>Those</HI> only the subject of my following discourse, which are so much (would to God I might not as truly say <HI>too-much</HI>) the subject of all our desires, <HI>viz.</HI> the Metals of Gold and Silver.</P>
<P N="2">2. Among all Metalls, Gold hath justly the preheminence or first place, in the esteeme of men, by reason of its naturall perfection and purity, which is such, as it renders the Metal in a manner incorruptible and of immortall durance. It is not improbably conceived to be a substance, wherein the Elements, <HI>viz.</HI> Fire, Earth, Water, &amp;c. (which are the naturall In∣gredients and constitution of all other sublu∣nary bodies) are mixed with most equall and exact proportion, both for quantity and quality, that is, there is no more of the Substance of any of them found in it, then the condition of the rest will most fitly agree with and endure, and that substance likwise most perfectly defecate and purged by the work of nature from all intrinsecall impurity or cor∣ruption, before it meets in composition with
<PB N="182" REF="101"/>
the rest, whence ariseth such a perfect Union and Consolidation of all the Elementall sub∣stances in the substance of Gold as is invinci∣ble, and resisteth the actiivity of all other bo∣dies whatsoever less purified, and less perfectly mixed, whose contrariety should otherwise cause corruption, or the dissolution of its sub∣stantiall and essentiall parts. I say the Elements in the composition of Gold, are both so pure in themselves, and likewise so perfectly mixed in due proportion to another, that it is natu∣rally impossible they should be separate, or dis∣solved one from another by the action of any other body, in which 'tis evident, they are not so perfectly mixed. Yea the Fire it self, the most active of all Elements and Elementary bodies, which incinerates and turns to Ashes, the substance of all common Metals, and sensibly wasteth Silver it self, yet prevails noe further upon this, than only to refine and pu∣rifie it, that is, to deliver it from the adulte∣rate and improper mixture of other Metals; but wasteth not one dram or scruple of pure Gold, though you melt it a hundred times o∣ver. This renders Gold in a manner incorrup∣tible and immortall (speaking naturally) and by consequence the most excellent and fitting instrument of commerce and bartery that the
<PB N="183" REF="101"/>
wit and reason of man could invent or desire. Second in excellency and in all properties of perfection unto Gold, is that of Silver; a sub∣stance, or Metallick body, wherein the Ele∣ment of water seems to pravail in some undue proportion above that of fire rendring thereby the whole substance of the Metall of a consti∣tution flegmatick, as I may say, and feminine, that is weak and less able to resist contrarieties, as appeares by the pale colour of it, and by ex∣perience upon all occasions of tryall: yet in comparison of all other Metals except Gold only) it is with all reason preferred, and que∣stionless excells them all both in purity and perfection of mixture, as much as it self is ex∣celled by gold; and perhaps much more. For I observe, the Metals of gold and silver doe (both of them) exceed all the other sorts of Metals, whither Iron, Brass, Copper, &amp;c. in∣comparably or beyond comparison, as wee say; I mean, there never was any certain compari∣son, or proportion of value, fixed and setled betwixt the one and the other by estimation or the common consent of men, as to say how much a pound of Gold is better worth than a pound of Iron; or a pound of Silver than a pound of Brass or Lead; not but that it may be easily calculated and known, how much the
<PB N="184" REF="102"/>
one exceeds the other in value; but because <HI>it is not commonly known,</HI> nor ever was, I sup∣pose, by any general and certain estimation or count among men: whereas the proportion, or difference in value, betwixt gold and silver, hath ever been generally and certainly known among men; not indeed so fixed &amp; certain as to be alwaies, &amp; in all places, one and the same (for it varieth according to times and places, and especially according as either the one or the other metal is plentiful, or scarse, needfull, or counted less necessary among men) but yet a proportion or some certain difference in va∣lue hath been ever commonly estimated and assigned betwixt them. Anciently the pro∣portion betwixt these metals is said to have been of <HI>ten for one,</HI> that is, one talent of gold was held to be worth ten talents of silver; so that if five talents of gold were due, and a man would make payment in silver, he should pay fifty talents; and for fifty due in gold, five hundred in silver. <HI>Pliny</HI> reports, that at the first coyning of these metals in <HI>Rome,</HI> the proportion was fourteen and an half or fifteen for one; others, as <HI>Herodotus,</HI> speak of thir∣teen. But that which seems now to be most common at the Indies, <HI>China,</HI> and other pla∣ces, especially where silver is scarce, is the pro∣portion
<PB N="185" REF="102"/>
of twelve for one; So that if an ounce of silver be worth five shillings, as it is said to be, an ounce of gold is worth three pound sterling, &amp; a pound of gold in weight worth no less than fourty eight pound of silver in Coyn.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of this Metal, <HI>viz</HI> gold, there is such plenty at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> that, beside the in∣finite rich Mines thereof, which they have in all the Provinces of the Southern part, <HI>viz. Peru, Castella del oro, Chile, &amp;c.</HI> and likewise in many of them in the Northern, especially in the Countries of <HI>Nicaragua, Veragua, Guadalaiara,</HI> there is scarse a River of note in all those parts, but the sands of it are well powder'd with gold, and afford good store of it to the washers: yea the very earth, or common soil, which they dig, or otherwise take up in most parts of <HI>Peru,</HI> is so tinctured with it, and yeelds ever and anon such grains and crumblings of it, that <HI>Acosta,</HI> an Author no way lavish of his reports, nor of a light judgement, professeth to think there is much more of the metal yet to be discovered than hath been found; judging, as he doth, by the ge∣neral qualitie or tincture of the Soile. There be three sorts of gold at the Indies, or rather the same gold or metal they finde in three several manners or waies, <HI>viz. in grains,</HI> as they call
<PB N="186" REF="103"/>
them, <HI>in powder,</HI> and <HI>in stone.</HI> Gold <HI>in graines</HI> they call certain small pieces of gold, which they finde in the earth, of pure and perfect me∣tal, without mixture of any other sort of baser alloy, or at least with so small a mixture, as it scarse needeth melting or refining. These the Spaniards in <HI>America</HI> call <HI>Pepones,</HI> from some resemblance which the grains have to the seeds of Melons or Pompions; though many times they are much bigger, and contain a pound weight or more. They finde silver likewise sometimes in the same manner, <HI>viz</HI> in grains, and pure; but that is but seldome, and a little in comparison of what they finde of the other. Gold <HI>in stone,</HI> is a vein or little Mine of gold, which groweth and spreadeth it self into branches in some flint or other stone, just as silver doth in the Mine. Much of this sort is found in the Mines of <HI>Curuma,</HI> and about the <HI>Salinas</HI> or <HI>Salt-wooks</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> a place so cal∣led; where they finde huge stones pierced ma∣ny times quite through, and interlaced every way with veins of gold, in such quantity, and so richly, that the stone is found, not seldom, to be more than half gold. Of this sort is that which they finde most commonly in the Mines, and is very good gold, but requireth excessive labour and pains to break it from the stone,
<PB N="187" REF="103"/>
and to get it forth. Gold <HI>in powder,</HI> is that which they gather in Rivers, Brooks, and other places where any store of water passeth from the Mountains, the streams or torrents where∣of, bring along with them, from the said mountains, aboundance of this metal in small pieces, which, as it comes, setleth continually in the sands and breaches of the said Rivers, where afterwards it is found. I say the gold it self is most probably thought to be ingen∣dred on the tops of the mountains or moun∣tainous parts of the Earth, and perhaps not far from the Source and Springs of those Ri∣vers in which it is found, and into whose streams it is easily conceived to be devolved in tract of time, by showres of rain, and by many other natural causes; and is not bred or ingendred in the sand or stream it self: And so likewise 'tis observed, they finde most plen∣ty of it commonly after some great floods. Of this sort of gold they gather greatest quan∣tity; there being, as I said, scarse a River of note in the whole Country of <HI>Peru,</HI> or Sou∣thern part of <HI>America,</HI> whose sands are not more or less tinctured and enamel'd with it. And it is most plentifull, so is it likewise, for the most part, very pure, and needs not half that labour of refining it, which gold <HI>in stone,</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="104"/>
or of the Mine usually doth. To gather it, they first of all divert, or turn the course of the stream some other way, and then search the Ford, especially in the breaches, if there be any, and in the cliffs, or hollow places of the banks, where it is likely it may settle in its pas∣sage with the waters: and in such places they alwaies finde best store. It is, for the most part, the womens work to gather this sort of gold; which they doe in this manner. They sit com∣monly knee-deep in the water, upon the bank of some River, or other place, where they have good store of water before them, with a Trey or little Bole in their hands, cut sloping on either side, but in the midst deep and round, like the bottom of a Barbors Bason, having a good quantity of the sand which they are to wash, continually standing by them, &amp; which is brought to them by some other body appoin∣ted to serve them: Of this sand they take what quantity they think fit, and wash it in their Treys, in such manner, as the sand and sandy earth easily washeth away together with the water, and the gold, by reason of its heaviness and weight, naturally sinks down and slips into the deep bottom or bole of the Trey: which when they have done, they deli∣ver it likewise to others that stand there to
<PB N="189" REF="104"/>
receive it, and take in more sand. So that to every Trey, or washer of gold, there are three or four persons at least appointed to attend, <HI>viz.</HI> one to bring the sand from the River to the washer, another to receive the gold when it is washed, one to oversee the work, and another to provide victuals and necessaries for them all. For they stir not from morning till night, from the place where they work. And thus you shall see hundreds of people washing and searching for gold all along the banks of the Rivers. This is generally the way of ga∣thering of gold: as for their manner of re∣fining it, we shall speak of that and the re∣fining of silver all under one.</P>
<P N="4">4. Silver they finde either in veins <HI>stragling,</HI> as they call them, or <HI>fixed.</HI> The first is, when they finde some piece, or a few small pieces of that metal alone; which when they have taken out of the Mine, or stone, there is no more of it to be found. The other is, when the vein of the metal runneth out, and spreads it self up and down the Mine, in breadth and length, upward, downward, and every way, like the root of a tree with arms, boughs, and branches; for so for the most part it doth; and the Mi∣neralists doe commonly represent the Mines of these metals, especially of silver, by the type
<PB N="190" REF="105"/>
of a tree planted within the bowels, or middle part, of some great mountain, with its root spreading largely downward, and with its boughs and branches reaching as far upwards, even to the top, or higher parts of the moun∣tain; at which it usually discovers it self, ei∣ther by some part of the pure vein it self, brea∣king out, and running along upon the ridges of the mountain, or but little within the sur∣face of the Earth, or else by the signes; which are certain fumosities, or metallick exhalati∣ons, which the Mine sendeth forth, of diverse colours, <HI>viz.</HI> yellowish, white, blew, green, according to the strength and quality of the Mine, and its neer approach to the surface of the Earth. These signes, where they finde them, they call <HI>Marchasites;</HI> and the neerer they approach in colour to the metal which they signifie, the better signes they are accounted to be, as arguing that the Mine is rich, and that the metal within the ground is well con∣cocted and pure. This, we must know, is a ge∣neral rule to discover and finde the Mines, but not universal. For sometimes they venture to dig, and fall upon very good Mines, without any such special signes appearing, only induced by the quality of the earth, and the natural barrenness of the mountain or place where
<PB N="191" REF="105"/>
they digge. And 'tis generally counted in <HI>Pe∣ru</HI> a signe good enough, if the mountain or mountainous part of the Earth which they pitch upon (for in such a Soile only the best and richest Mines are found) be very rugged, hard, and sharp, and so absolutely barren, that not a Tree, Plant, or Shrub, groweth on it, and that the grass (if yet it bear any) be of a faint withered colour, and seeming, as it were, to be parched with drought. These veins lye commonly deep within ground, yet affording very good and pure metal. The principal veins of the Mine, for the most part, run directly North and South, yet branching themselves into lesser boughs several wayes, <HI>viz.</HI> East, West, and towards all quarters, being found many times five or six foot broad, and seldom so narrow as a span, and this running and branching of the veins in the Mine, they call the <HI>Chase.</HI> The way of digging for the metal is diverse. Sometimes they begin at the top, or upper part of the mountain, where they first observe the <HI>Marchasites,</HI> or signes of the me∣tal, and sink the Mine downward like a well, only taking a convenient space of ground for the platform or compass of the Mine, and lea∣ving <HI>Stanzas,</HI> or places to rest upon and di∣spatch necessary business, at a certain distance
<PB N="192" REF="106"/>
one from another continually, as they work deeper into the Mine. The other is, to begin to digge at the foot, or neer the bottom of the mountain, in line almost level, that is, sloping a little upwards, and till they come perpen∣dicularly under the place, where they first ob∣served the tokens of the metal; it being a thing generally presumed by the Miners, that though every Mine of metal that may be in the body of a mountain, doth not shew it self by signes at the top, as when it lyes very deep within ground, or is obstructed by some Quarrey of stone or otherwise, yet wheresoever any such signes of it doe appear at the top, there it reacheth to the bottom of the mountain or to the level of the plain ground, at least well nigh to it, and that the deeper the Mine runs within ground, the bigger and better it is, verifying in a new sense the proverb, <HI>The best is at the bottome.</HI> This is counted the best way of Mining, and most commodious in many respects, especially for drayning away of the waters, which are commonly found in the Mineral hills, and doe extreamly trouble the Miners in their work, if they be not diverted; and likewise for carrying the silver out of the Mines when it is digged: neither of which can be done the other way, <HI>viz.</HI> where the Mine
<PB N="193" REF="106"/>
is sunk right downward, without excessive la∣bour, charge, time, and hazard to the work∣men; but this way are done with ease. For the waters that issue out of the chinks of the mountain, and fall into the Mines, are easily received into certain Cisterns, made for the purpose, and by pipes diverted which way they please; and the silver is no less easily carried out of the Mine: For the way to the mouth of it being either level or sloping downwards, the poor Miners are not forced to mount with it upon their backs, as they doe the other way two hundred, sometimes three hundred <HI>stades,</HI> or man-heights, from the place where they dig it, upon ladders made of Neats-hides or leather, and from which, many times by mischance, they fall down with it into the Mines upon their backs, and are broken to pieces. If they dig far into the mountain, be∣fore they come at the Mine, they are forced to use the Compass to direct their course, as if they were at Sea, according as by the signes they observed the vein to run, when they first found it. They have likewise another advan∣tage of the water, when they dig the Mine this way, <HI>viz.</HI> that by the force of it in the chan∣nel or pipes, by which it runs out of the Mine, they turn about certain Mills, and other En∣gins,
<PB N="194" REF="107"/>
by which they break and grinde the me∣tal, when they have gotten it out of the Rock, and prepare it for the refining; doing likewise thereby many other necessary businesses apper∣taining to the Mines. Nevertheless about and neer to the mouth of the Mine, they have hou∣ses of all necessary office beside, for the Mi∣ners and other workmen; and especially a Smiths Forge, for the sharpening and repairing of their tools: for their labour is excessive hard and difficult, and it requires both edged tools and strong armes to split the hard metal, and break it out of the Mine; which they are forced to doe with wedges, hammers, and all sorts of instruments, and with no less difficul∣tie than they break the hardest flynt, or any other Quarry of stone. They labour likewise perpetually in them, I mean, by turns, so as while one company worketh, another sleepeth and takes rest: but the work it self of the Mine never stands still, but goeth continually on night and day; of which, in the Mines, they know no difference, working altogether by candle-light, as well by day as by night, and without which, their noon and their midnight would be both alike. For indeed the Mines in this respect may be taken for the Suburbs of Hell, by reason of their extream darkness; and
<PB N="195" REF="107"/>
how neer soever they be to that which com∣mandeth all things, yet they alwaies want there three of the chief comforts of Nature, having neither Sun nor Light, nor good Aire in the Mines.</P>
<P N="5">5. The last and most curious work about the Metals is the refining of them, that is, the separating and purging them from the mixture of other courser metals, with which they are alwaies more or less ingendred in the Mines. This is done two manner of waies, either by Fire, or by Quick-silver. The Indians ancient∣ly, before the Spaniards came among them, used no other way of refining but onely by fire, and melting of the metal. To which end they had usually, and have still in many places, to this day, several small furnaces, which they call <HI>Guayras,</HI> built neer the Mines, in places where the winde commonly bloweth; with which, without further trouble or need of bellows, only by supplying them with wood or coale from time to time, as shall be neces∣sary, they make their refining. And they say there is some kinde of silver, particularly that of <HI>Potozi,</HI> which will not be melted by any artificial winde they can make, as of the bel∣lows, or otherwise, but only by that which is natural of the <HI>Guayras:</HI> and therefore upon

the sides of that huge mountain, <HI>viz. Potozi,</HI> there are commonly seen five or six thousand of these <HI>Guayras,</HI> or little fires, burning all at one time together; which in an evening, or dark night, they say is a very pleasant spectacle, to behold them blazing all at once, like so many little Comets, or fixed Meteors of the Earth. But the more common and speedy way is to refine by Quick-silver, which the Spani∣ards doe now generally use; both because they have extraordinary plenty of it, and because they finde it draws more silver out of the mass which they refine, than by fire they can doe.</P>
<P N="6">6. Quick-silver among metals is like water among the elements, it is the glue and solder of them, <HI>viz.</HI> when it is refracted and in due proportion: for otherwise, when it is united, and entire in it self, it separates and consumes all of them but gold and silver. In which re∣spect they call it not improperly the <HI>Humidum radicale</HI> of metals. It is a liquid substance, ha∣ving no certain form or fixed subsistence of it self, but runs continually from place to place, as gold and silver, or other metals doe, when they are melted, yet is it the heaviest and most compacted of all other metals; for they all swim upon quick-silver, and will never sink to the bottom. They say a piece of Iron of two
<PB N="197" REF="108"/>
or three pound weight hath been cast into a little barrel or vessel of quick-silver, which swam upon the top of it, like corke, or some piece of light wood in a vessel of water, and would not sink; only gold, they say, will sink; which they attribute to a secret propertie and sympathie, that is betwixt those two metals. It hath many rare and admirable properties; but that which may seem most remarkable, and which fits it so much for the effect we are now speaking of, <HI>viz.</HI> the refining and purifying of the metals, is the natural sympathie and in∣clination which it hath to gold and silver, espe∣cially the first; which it naturally seeks out, where it is to be found, among all metals, se∣parates and divides it from them all, and it self embracing and circling it round about im∣mediatly, and without the mixture or inter∣position of any thing else but it self. In the same manner, but not altogether so intimately and perfectly it unites with silver; not pene∣trating the substance of the metal, which the perfect composition thereof, if it be pure and fine, resisteth and forbiddeth as hath been said, but only embracing and circling about it on all sides, yet piercing and consuming the cour∣ser metals, if there be, and so long as there be any of them mixed with it. And though it be
<PB N="198" REF="109"/>
of it self the heaviest of all other metals, yet is it soonest transmuted or changed into the lightest substance of all, <HI>viz.</HI> smoak; which a little fire presently doth: and that smoak eva∣porating, and flying up into any colder Region or when it encounters any cold metal, as in the head or top of a Still, it presently gathers together again, and becomes perfect quick-silver. Hence it serveth so excellently well to refine and purifie both these metals, <HI>viz.</HI> gold and silver, and likewise to be it self separa∣ted from them again afterward. It groweth naturally in the Vermillion, or <HI>Minium,</HI> which is a metal well known &amp; much used for paint∣ing &amp; dying; and of which they have admirable rich Mines in diverse parts of <HI>America;</HI> espe∣cially those of <HI>Palcas,</HI> out of which they draw yearly, only for the Kings use, a hundred thou∣sand <HI>pezos</HI> of mine; and those of <HI>Guancavilca,</HI> which yeeld every yeer eight or nine thousand Quintals, or so many times one hundred twenty five pound weight of quick-silver: And of another they report, that a poor Indi∣an of <HI>Acoria,</HI> who first found it, sold the inte∣rest which he thereby had in the Mine, <HI>viz.</HI> for discovering of it, for two hundred and fiftie thousand Duckats, and afterwards commen∣ced a suit against the buyer for deceiving him
<PB N="199" REF="109"/>
in the bargain; it being found, that his only interest in the Mine, for finding it, was well worth five hundred thousand pound and more. Before they can use it for the refining &amp; purging of other metals, they must first separate it from the stone or metal in w<SUP>ch</SUP> it groweth. This they easily doe by fire, which melts the stone, being first well grinded or broken, &amp; the quick-silver evaporates in smoak up to the head or top of the Limbeck, or vessell wherein it is melted, where encountring a colder substance, it as quickly congregats and thickens again, and would fall presently down again, but that in the discent it is by pipes in the head of the Limbe k or Stillatorie diverted into some other vessels ap∣pointed to receive it. They keep it in nothing so well as in leather-vessels: for any thing of wood or ordinary metal it would eate through and destroy: and 'tis said, they spend only at the Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> in the refining of silver by it, 6 or 7000 Quintals, one year with another.</P>
<P N="7">7. Silver, if it be good, even when 'tis first digged out of the Mine, is of a white greyish colour, like the best sort of Amber: but if it looks darker, inclining any thing to black or red, it is not counted good, but rather con∣ceived to have in it a great quantity of earth and dross, which must be purged away in the
<PB N="200" REF="110"/>
refining: Nevertheless they count it no ill vein, when every pound weight of metal out of the Mine yeelds but two or three <HI>pezos</HI> of perfect silver, when 'tis refined. Now the man∣ner of refining metals by quick-silver, and also of separating the quick-silver again from the metals, when they are perfectly refined, is thus. First of all with hammers, and other instru∣ments for the purpose, they break and grinde the metals as small as possibly they can, redu∣cing them, so neer as may be, into a dust or powder, which they afterwards sift through a searse of Copper, and then put it into certain Troughs or broad open vessels, being first moi∣stened or well steept in brine or salt water. This they doe, because the salt hath a certain quick penetrative force in it, and is apt to separate the earthly and drossie parts which as yet stick to the metal, and consequently makes it more fit to receive and draw the quick silver to it. When this is done, they set the vessels which contain the powder, or pulverizated substance of the metals upon little furnaces, with a soft fire under them, which they increase by little and little. This is done, because the fire also is observed very much to help and facilitate the incorporating of the quick-silver, with the me∣tal. After this having the quick-silver
<PB N="201" REF="110"/>
or Mercury (as the Chymists call it from its nimbleness and active, searching into the me∣tals) in a piece of Holland, or some other fine and strong linnen, they press or strain it through the cloath upon the metal in the ves∣sells; upon which it falleth in small drops like dew: some body in the mean time con∣tinually moving and stirring the metal up and down in the vessel, while the quick-silver drops upon it, and afterwards also at times, for the space of five or six dayes together: in which time the mercury will be so perfectly incor∣porate with the metal, and have united it self so intimately to it, that nothing shall be be∣twixt them, but that all the dross, earth, or other course metal whatsoever, with which it was naturally engendred or mixed before, shall be either consumed or separated from it. After some time, when the Refiners think the Mercury hath done his part, and be perfectly incorporated with the metal that is to be re∣fined, they take the whole quantity or mass of it together, out of the Troughs or vessels where they are, and put it into certain other vessels, which are bigger and almost full of water; in which they again fall to stir and to move the quick-silver and metal together up and down the vessel, in such manner, as that the earth and
<PB N="202" REF="111"/>
drossie parts of the metal, separated from the other, doe pass away with the water, and the silver or gold united with the mercurie, as be∣ing more ponderous and weighty substances, remain at the bottom: which they take out and wash yet once again in Keelers, or certain broad and deep platters, till it seem throughly purged from the earth and drossie substance. The metal thus united with mercury appears like small sand. And because there alwaies slips away some portion of silver and quick-silver with the dross in the washings, there∣fore they commonly wash that dross over and over again, till at length nothing be lost either of the one or other. When they are thus throughly cleansed from the dross, they appear bright and shining, either with a white or yellowish colour, according to the proper nature of the metal that is united with the mercury. And by this they know the me∣tals are refined as much as they ought. Then followeth the last piece of work, which is to separate the mercury or quick-silver from the metal, wherewith it is incorporate, that so they may have the pure metal alone. And this is done thus.</P>
<P N="8">8. First they strain it, as before, through a piece of strong fine linnen, or Holland, as forcibly as
<PB N="203" REF="111"/>
they can by this means if there be any Quick-silver not incorporate and united with the me∣tal, it passeth out as before in little drops like dew which they gather and save; and the rest, <HI>viz.</HI> the silver and quick-silver united remain in one lump together: which with much art and diligence they work last of all into the fa∣shion of a Sugar-loaf, containing most com∣monly one hundred pound weight in the whole, and made hollow in the midst. This they set upon a furnace, covered with a certain earthern vessell in the nature of a Limbeck or Still, but of the same fashion, and mould that the metall within is, <HI>viz.</HI> of a Sugar-loaf, laying some few coals upon the top of it, and giving a good strong heat to the furnace. With this heat all the quick-silver in the metal pre∣sently evaporates and flies up, as we said be∣fore, into the top of the Limbeck or earthern vessell, where being refrigerated by the en∣counter of a colder substance, it quickly thick∣ens again, and distils downwards by the sides of the Limbeck, like the smoak or vapour of a pot covered and seething on the fire; and by certain Retorts or pipes framed conveniently in the head or upper part of the said Limbeck or earthen vessel, it is not permitted to fall right down again, but diverted another way,
<PB N="204" REF="112"/>
and received apart by it self. The silver in the mean time remaining entire upon the furnace, without changing form, but yet abating much of its weight, by reason of the absence of the mercury, which is now flown quite away. They say it abates commonly five parts of six in the weight: so that if the whole lump or loaf of silver and Mercury united, weigh threescore pound, when it is first set on the furnace, when the Mercury is sublimated and gone, it weighs not above ten; so great is the disproportion or difference in weight betwixt them.</P>
<P N="9">9. For the breaking and grinding of the metalls, when they are first taken out of the Mine, which, as we said before, is a necessary preparative to their refining and incorpora∣ting with the <HI>Mercury,</HI> they have many En∣gins or Mills, some whereof goe with Horses or <HI>Bufalos</HI> in them; others are turned by wa∣ter, carrying huge Pestles in them, which beat and break the metall, after the manner of Tanne-mills. They carry commonly twelve or fourteen Pestles apeice, and there are said to be no less than fourty eight of these Mills at <HI>Po∣tozi,</HI> which goe by water, and thirty more which goe with Horses, beside a multitude of hand-Engins: at the City of <HI>Tarapaya,</HI> not farre from <HI>Potozi;</HI> there are twenty two all
<PB N="205" REF="112"/>
upon the water, which doe nothing else but grinde and break the silver, as in so many great Morters, night and day without ceasing. When the metal is thus separated from the Mercury, they count it pure and refined, whither it be gold or silver, and as such melt it again into barres, and carry it to the Touchstone and marking. For it is not yet so perfectly purified and fine, but it must, at least in part, endure one tryall and purging more. This is done by the Assay-master, as they call him, who gives to every peice or barre of silver, its particular Al∣loy or value, according to which it must be sold, and pass for metal more or less fine and pure, and without which Alloy and mark gi∣ven it by the Assay-master, it is not lawfull to vend any of those metalls. It's a great and rich Office at the Indies to be Assay-master, and requires likewise a great and exact skill in the metalls, <HI>viz.</HI> to give the true alloy and value to every peice and barre of metall that is brought. The business is done thus. They bring their metal in barres or ingots to the Assay-master or his Deputy, who cuts from every one of them a small peice of metal, and weighs it exactly, marking well out of which barre or ingot every peice was cut; and then puts them one by one into severall Crusibles or Melting-pots
<PB N="206" REF="113"/>
which he hath standing on the fire, marked every one of them according to the number of the barre, to which the peice of metall belongs, that he puts into it. These Crusibles are little small vessells made for no other purpose, but for the last trying of the metall, and most com∣monly of the ashes of certain burnt bones, which are beaten together and cast into a Mould. To every one of these set on the Fur∣nace, the Assay-master gives a strong and vio∣lent fire by which the metal instantly melts, and the Lead, Copper, Tin, or other baser me∣tal, in case there be any yet remaining in it, dis∣solves and evoporates into smoake, and the sil∣ver or other metal, remains in the Crusible a∣lone, now advanced to the utmost perfection and fineness that art can give it, and withall so strangely united and fixed in it self, that though it be liquid and molten, yet they say, it will never spill nor run out, though the mouth of the Crusible should be turned downward, but abides still within it, firm and fixed without loosing one drop, or the least particle of its substance. When the Assay-master perceives by the colour of it (which is then fiery red) that the metal is perfectly refin'd, and that it hath evaporated all that was evoporable by fire in its substance, he takes the severall Crusibles off the
<PB N="207" REF="113"/>
furnaces, and sets them in some place, where they may conveniently cool, and then weighs every piece over again, observing with won∣derfull exactness, what every one wants of the weight which it had, when it was first put in, and according to the wast, that is, according to what he finds it want, of the first weight: he gives the whole barre or ingot of metal the alloy, and markes it at what value or estima∣tion of purity and fineness it shall pass. The ballance and weights which they use, are the most delicate and curious in the world, and their graines so small, that they cannot be ta∣ken up by a mans fingers, but only with a small pair of pincers, which they have on purpose: and they make the triall for the most part by candle light, that not so much as any suspicion of winde or aire extraordinary should inter∣vene, to move the ballance one way or other. So precisely curious are they in the business; and not altogether without cause, for upon the estimate of this little piece, the value and judgement of the whole barre, or ingot, for purity and fineness, dependeth, as hath been said.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the famous silver-Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> and of the Pearles and Pearl-fishing at the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. I Should conclude too abruptly, and leave the report, which I pretend to make, of the wealth and riches of the New-world very imperfect; if in treating of the subject of metals, I should forget those fa∣mous and unparalled Mines at <HI>Potozi,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Peru.</HI> I confesse the Spanish wri∣ters seem to me to be a little reserved, and spa∣ring in their reports concerning the Gold-mines of <HI>America,</HI> mentioning them onely in the generall, and not particularizing much of them one way or other; whither out of de∣signe or no, I cannot say: but of these silver-mines at <HI>Potozi,</HI> they are wonderfully liberall and free, as if they meant to make them the admiration and envie of all the world beside. And truly it is not altogether without cause. For doubtless they are one of the most admira∣ble things and discoveries of nature: a trea∣sure, which the Bountifull hand of Divine Pro∣vidence, had from the beginning laid up there
<PB N="209" REF="114"/>
for the Princes of the Catholique Monarchy, and for the defence of the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> And though it be only one mountain or hill of it self, with a little hillock growing out at the foot of it, yet is it so infinitely rich, that it seemes to be all of silver, and would doubtless of it self alone, be a sufficient support and re∣venue for any Prince in Christendome what∣soever, that had it by him at home in his owne dominions. It is but one Tree, yet so excel∣lently branched and laden, that all <HI>Europe</HI> is filled with the fruit of it. In a word it is but one generall Mine, yet so admirably weal∣thy and good, that the treasure of it alone, if it could be gotten, would pay three such Ar∣mies as the State maintaines, and be a compe∣tent revenue for all publick occasions beside. I know my sober Reader will think I speak with the largest, and that I use an huge liberty of Hyperbolizing in what I say; but it is not so, I keepe within bounds, and though I must con∣fess of my self, I doe not without some diffi∣culty beleeve what I report; yet I say no more than what very grave Authors, wise and sober men, that have seen the place, and profess to speake, not only of themselves, but according to the judgement and estimation of men that live there, and are well experienced in the Mines,
<PB N="210" REF="115"/>
will make good by their testimony. I shall need to name, onely <HI>Acosta,</HI> who in his naturall Hi∣story of the <HI>Indies (lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 12.) tels us, 'tis the opinion of understanding men in those a∣ffaires, that there are no less than three hun∣dred thousand Quintalls of metal refined at <HI>Potozi</HI> every yeare; and <HI>Laet</HI> in his <HI>discriptio novi Orbis lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 4. tels me, that a Quin∣tall is a measure, which with the Spaniards in <HI>America</HI> containeth one hundred twenty five pound weight. Put these together, and the summe will be thirty eight Millions, five hun∣dred thousand pound weight of silver melted at <HI>Potozi,</HI> yeerly. I suppose it will be said, he means of Bullion or metall out of the Mine; whereof silver, when it is refined, makes not the third part. I grant both, being willing to give all the advantage to moderate propositions that I can. But let us then suppose, that every pound weight of metal out of the Mine, yeelds a <HI>Pezo,</HI> or which is less, but five Shillings, of fine silver (which I suppose no man will deny but it doth, one with another) and it will a∣boundantly justifie what I say, <HI>viz.</HI> that if we had it, it would pay three such Armies as the State maintains, and afford a competent reve∣nue for all publick occasions beside. For it a∣mounts to little less than ten millions of mo∣ney,
<PB N="211" REF="115"/>
<HI>viz.</HI> to nine millions three hundred and fifty thousand pound by account; which un∣der favour I humbly conceive is an Income thrice as great as the State expendeth yeerly one way or other. And otherwise they con∣fess comonly, that the Kings annuall re∣venue out of this only Mine (which is but the fifth part) is above a million one year with a∣nother.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Potozi</HI> is a Mountain in the country of <HI>Charcas,</HI> a Province of <HI>Peru,</HI> in the Southern part of <HI>America.</HI> It lieth about sixty or seven∣ty leagues distant from the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and a∣bout twice so many from the Atlantick, or Northern, (of which we shall speak more in due place) being of a soil, when the Mine was first discovered, extreamly dry, hard and rocky, and every way as unpleasant to the eye as might be; and so utterly barren, that it yeel∣ded no kinde of commodity or fruit outward∣ly. And though it lie within the Tropiques in the twenty first degree of latitude, yet is the aire about it very cold, and the place in the moneths of <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> constant∣ly showred with rain. The colour of the Soil is for the most part of a dark red, and the whole fashion of the moutain somewhat re∣sembling a pavillion or round Tent, with a
<PB N="212" REF="116"/>
point sharpening still upwards in the manner of a Sugar-loafe; being in height from the plain ground, about a quarter of a Spanish league, and in the compass at the bottom a full league or more; and at the foot of it on the one side, there groweth out a lesser hill, which the Indians call <HI>Guaina Potozi,</HI> which signifies the <HI>little</HI> or <HI>younger Potozi,</HI> which hath veines of good metal likewise, but <HI>stragling</HI> here and there in divers parts of the mountain, and not <HI>fixed,</HI> or running in continued branches, as those of the great <HI>Potozi</HI> doe. It is a place of it self, or to outward appearance, that would be thought altogether unhabitable by reason of the unpleasantness and barrenness of its out∣side: but its wealth within hath so peopled it round about, that there is not any Town at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> of greater resort than it, nor bet∣ter supplied with all sorts of things, either for necessity or delight, having Flesh-meat of all sorts, Fowle and Venison in aboundance, vari∣etie of choise Fruits, excellent Wines, with all kinde of conserves and other delicates besides. The dwellings of the Spaniards and Indians, who come thither onely for pleasure, or else for the gain and trading of the Mines, are said to extend two or three leagues in circuit round about the foot of the hill: the Mines whereof
<PB N="213" REF="116"/>
were first discovered by a poore Indian about the yeare 1546, accidentally, as it might seem, in this manner.</P>
<P N="3">3. A certain American of <HI>Chumbivilca,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Cusco,</HI> named <HI>Gualpa,</HI> was hunting thereabouts for venison; and being forced to use his hands to climbe up a part of the mountain that was rocky, and had some few bushes growing upon it, by chance laid hold upon a little shrub, which grew out of a vein of the silver, and strained himselfe so much to get up, that he pulled up the branch by the roots, perceiving in the hole or place where the root grew, some quantity of metal; which upon better veiw and some experience he had of the Mines at <HI>Porco,</HI> not above six leagues distant from thence, he found to be very good: whereupon he began to look better about him, and found presently scatter'd up and down on the surface of the earth, severall other pieces of the same metall, but a little changed in colour, by reason they had lain o∣pen (a long time perhaps) to the rain and wea∣ther; which yet only upon carrying to <HI>Porco,</HI> he quickly found to be good metal, and what a brave fortune he had met with by his hun∣ting. And for some time he managed his bu∣siness warily and happily, drawing silver con∣tinually
<PB N="214" REF="117"/>
out of his Mine, as much as he could desire. But it was not long before a compani∣on, or friend of his, whose name was <HI>Guanca,</HI> perceived so much of it, that he made shift to become Sharer with him in the Mine: and so they two enjoyed for a while the richest Mine in the world; and might have done so much longer but for their own covetuousness and dissention. It happened that the part of the Mine, which this New-comer <HI>Guanca</HI> had cho∣sen proved not so much to his liking, as he ex∣pected, and therefore he desired to share in common with <HI>Gualpa</HI> in his Mine; which was not better metal than the others was, but more easie to get forth: but <HI>Gualpa</HI> refused; and the other was so much provoked upon it, that, being but a Servant to one <HI>Villaroel</HI> a Spaniard of <HI>Porco,</HI> he presently discovers the whole bu∣siness to his Master: who thereupon making search, and finding the metall good, and the Mine likely to be rich, immediately repaires to the Kings Officers, makes known the Mine, and procures his Servant <HI>Guanca,</HI> to be enrol∣led first discoverer of it, and together with him <HI>undertakes the vein,</HI> as they call it, that is, procures so much land about the Mine to be marked out and allotted, as the Law alloweth unto those that first discover a Mine, which is
<PB N="215" REF="117"/>
some certain yeards round about the plot, and to those that will undertake to dig and search it. By this means they become Lords of the Mine, having liberty to dig and draw forth the silver as their own, paying the King his Tribute, which is the fifth part of what they draw forth.</P>
<P N="4">4. There were presently upon this three or four other principal veins of the Mine disco∣vered upon this Mountain; of which, that which is called <HI>the rich one</HI> they report, that at first it ran along in a ridge, above the surface of the earth or plain ground, the full height of a Lance, three hundred foot together in length, and thirteen or fourteen foot broad, continu∣ing likewise in this proportion of bounty and richness above fiftie or threescore stades, or so many times the height of a man within ground, They had digged by the year 1588. two hun∣dred stades deep into the ground, still follow∣ing the Mine; which because it runs not di∣rectly downward, but sloping somewhat in the mountain, they suppose it will be above a thou∣sand or twelve hundred stades before they come at the root of the Mine, or the foot of the hill. This Mine yeelded at the first one hundred and fifty, or two hundred thousand <HI>pezos</HI> every week into the Register of the
<PB N="216" REF="118"/>
Contractation house, as they call it, and the King, by the year above-said, had received out of it no less than a hundred millions of pieces of Assay, that is, if I understand my Author aright, so many millions of such pieces as they carrie to the Assay-master, to be tryed and marked by him, when it is refined: which helps well to verifie what he saith in another place, that in the Fleet of the year 1587, in which <HI>Acosta,</HI> came from the Indies, there came along with it eleven millions of Treasure, of which neer the one half belonged to the King. The labour in these Mines, as I intimated be∣fore, is excessively difficult and hard, the Aire they have very gross, extreme cold and un∣wholsome for any body not used to it: they work night and day without ceasing, only by Candle-light, without other knowledge or distinction of day and night, save what they gather by their work, or by their wearines, and desire to be at rest. But that which seems most grievous of all is the labour and danger of carrying the metal out of the Mines; which they doe thus. They have Ladders of three branches or rows, made of Neats hides, so strongly twisted in thongs, that it yeelds not to wood for strength or toughness, and suppo∣sed to endure the aire of the Mines longer
<PB N="217" REF="118"/>
than wood would doe; these are commonly ten stades high, and at the foot of them there is a kinde of Scaffold or stage built in form of a Gallery, with seats and other conveniences, to rest upon. The rows of the Ladders are so framed together with wood, &amp; at such distance, that, if occasion be, they may both mount and descend together. Every man carries the weight of fifty or threescore pound of metal upon his back, tyed up in a Wallet or cloath, in such manner cast over and fastened to his head, as he is sure enough for losing his charge, and the whole weight of the metal resteth up∣on his shoulders behinde. They mount com∣monly three and three together, the fore-man carrying the light, which is a candle so fastened to the thumb of one of his hands, as he may use all the other part of his hand to hold by; which is more than needs. For many times, in such great altitude, going or coming, their hold slips, or by some other mischance, the poor Miners come to the ground sooner than they would, losing their lives by the fall, or at least are so maimed and broken with it, that many times death were better than life to them. This was at first the manner of working and laboring in the Mines at <HI>Potozi,</HI> till they had digged in several veins above two hundred
<PB N="218" REF="119"/>
stades deep within ground: Since that time, to remedie the inconveniences and trou∣ble that came by carrying out the metal at the Top of the Mine in so great an height, they have invented <HI>Soccabons,</HI> as they call them, which are certain counter-Mines, as it were, wrought in from the sides or lower parts of the mountain, in a level line towards that part of the mountain where the vein of the metal runs, and to which the Mine that was begun at the top is brought. By this means they enter the Mines now to work, and export the me∣tal with much more ease, and less danger than formerly, both at <HI>Potozi</HI> and all other places generally, where there are Mines. These <HI>Soc∣cabons,</HI> or cross-Mines, are commonly about eight or ten foot in bredth, and somewhat more than a stade in height; which they keep shut at several places with dores, for the secu∣rity of the passage. One of them, <HI>viz.</HI> that which was made to meet <HI>the rich vein,</HI> as they call it, is said to have been above twenty yeers in the digging and making; containing well nigh three hundred yards in length, before it came at the vein of metal; in all which way they were forced to make their passage and work through the hard and flinty bowels of the mountain, with excessive toyle and labour;
<PB N="219" REF="119"/>
and the <HI>Soccabons</HI> of the other Mines cost not much less either of time or pains: So great charges, pains, and peril, are men content to be at for a thing of naught; for that which is no∣thing else, for the most part to them, but an instrument of trouble, vexation, and sin.</P>
<P N="5">5. Something must be said likewise (before we leave this subject) of the Jemmes and pre∣cious Stones, that are found at the <HI>New World,</HI> they being so considerable a part of the riches and wealth of it. These are chiefly (at least for ought I yet perceive) Emralds and Pearls; of which there is so great plenty at the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> that the aboundance of them makes them the less esteemed, verifying herein a pretty passage of storie, reported to have happened betwixt a Spaniard of the <HI>West-In∣dies,</HI> and an Italian in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Spaniard was newly come from <HI>America</HI> richly fraighted, having brought over with him, amongst other things of value, a great quantity of fair and goodly Emralds; whereof shewing one (a ve∣ry fair stone) to the Italian, who he knew had skill, and used to deale in such commodities, he asked what it was worth? The Italian, up∣on sight of it, answered roundly, he thought it worth one hundred Duckets. Being shew∣ed another of more exquisite lustre and form,
<PB N="220" REF="120"/>
he prized it at three hundred: Whereupon the Spaniard, having good store of them, and tickled with hopes of extraordinary gain by them, would needs carrie the Merchant home to his lodging, and shewed him a casket full of them. The Italian seeing such a quantity of them together, Sir, said he, If you have such store, I will give you crowns apiece for them, and they will not be worth much more either to you or me: intimating thereby, that stones are chiefly estimated according to the raritie and scarsness of them: which was very true, though it grieved the Spaniard not a little. The Emrald, according to the report of <HI>Pliny,</HI> if it be a right and perfect stone of that kinde, is the most pleasant and delightsome Jem to the eye that is, of an exquisite verdure or green colour; yea, they say, it is not only agre∣able and pleaseth the sight very much, but that it attracts it also with a strange kinde of effi∣cacie, so as a man seems not satisfied with look∣ing upon it, but desires to view it still more and more; that it fortifieth the facultie vi∣sive, and restoreth it when it is dim and de∣cayed by overmuch attent looking upon any thing: and therefore Lapidaries, and men that cut or engrave fine stones, have usually some of them lying by them, only to refresh and
<PB N="221" REF="120"/>
revive their sight, when they perceive it fail them, or grow weak at any time. To which end, <HI>viz.</HI> the better to please and affect the sight, they are shap'd or cut, for the most part with some hollowness in them, whereby the <HI>visual rayes,</HI> as they are called, being united and strengthened one with another, doe give the greater lustre. They are said to appear both fairer and bigger at a distance, nor doe they change or abate their lustre, either for Sun, shade, candle-light, or otherwise, as most of the other sorts of Jemmes usually doe, more or less: and as they are commonly of the big∣ness, so are they not much under the value of a Diamond, if they be of the best and perfect sort of Emralds: For all are not such. There are some of so exquisite and admirable lustre, as nothing can be desired more; in others the green is more dark and clowded: and lastly, some are spotted; but those are commonly held to be counterfeit. Those which the for∣tunate <HI>Cortez,</HI> after the conquest of <HI>Mexico,</HI> presented to his new Spouse, the Lady <HI>Jane Zuniga,</HI> were extraordinary, and thought to be the rarest in the World. They were five of them, of most exquisite colour and perfection; and of such bigness, that they were wrought into several figures and shapes of things: <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="121"/>
one in the fashion of a Coronet, or little Crown; another of a Rose, fair and great; the third was like to a Fish, with the eyes of gold, counted an admirable piece of Indian work; the fourth was wrought in the fashion of a Bell, having for its clapper a great and rich pearl, engraven round about with this Motto, <HI>Sea Bendito qui te criava,</HI> in English, <HI>Blessed is he that created thee;</HI> the fifth was like a Cup, with the foot and brim of gold, and four little chains of gold, all joyning to∣gether at the top or cover of it, in a great pearl. 'Tis said that the Merchants of <HI>Genoa</HI> offered no less summe than 40000. Duckets for one of them, which they would have presented to the great Turk; but were refused: And though I confess there be some of much greater bigness mentioned in <HI>Pliny,</HI> yet doubtless these were very rare stones both for bigness, workmanship, and perfection. They grow usually in other stones like to Chrystal, and the greatest plenty of them is in the new Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> and in the Province of <HI>Veragua,</HI> and especially about the Citties of <HI>Manta</HI> and <HI>Port Vieil;</HI> where there is a whole Country, or little Pro∣vince, which they call <HI>de las Esmaldas,</HI> or <HI>the Land of Emralds,</HI> from the aboundance of them, that are supposed to be there, and which
<PB N="223" REF="121"/>
the Spaniards had not yet subdued, when my Author wrote: and they send usually three or four hundred weight of this kinde of Jemmes only into <HI>Spain,</HI> one yeer with another.</P>
<P N="6">6. Of Pearls, which anciently were counted the only Jemme, both for price and excellency, and such as Princes only, and persons of very noble quality used, there is such plenty of them at the new World, that the very Negro Ser∣vants, or She slaves, are said to weare Chains and Bracelets of them. These grow in Oysters, or a certain shel-Fish much resembling Oy∣sters, and bearing that name; and are fetcht up from the bottom of the Sea by the poor Indians that are forced to dive for them. 'Tis true, the Indians, through necessity and cu∣stome, are become wonderfully apt and ready at this work, even almost beyond beleefe. They will descend commonly ten or twenty fathom deep into the water, and stay there an houre, or the better part of an houre, plucking the shel-fishes from the hard Rocks, or searching for them in the gravelly corners and chinks under water, till they have filled the satchels or baggs which they carried down with them; or that want of breath enforceth them to come up. Howbeit if the Sea be very deep, or not calm, they finde much difficultie to
<PB N="224" REF="122"/>
abide under water, and therefore tye common∣ly certain stones of good weight about them, only to keep them down, which are exceeding painfull to them all the time they are under water, beside the danger they are in to be de∣stroyed by the Tyburons, and other preying fishes, whiles they are there. But when they have a minde to come up, 'tis but unloosing of the stones, and they mount presentiy, being counted the most expert Swimmers in the World: To which likewise their own dry, wi∣ther'd, and lean complexions doe dispose them very much; being, for the most part, of very thin and spare bodies, and dyeted on purpose for this service, with the dryest meat which their hard Masters can procure for them, and that also in small quantity and with but scant allowance. The Pearls differ much from one another, both in fashion, colour, bigness, and polishing, and they seldom finde two of them altogether alike: when they doe, it much en∣haunceth the price and estimation of them, even where they are most common; a pair of such Pearls having been valued, at the In∣dies themselves, at a thousand Duckets. They are counted the most excellent which are of an Orient white colour, bright and cleer, like the finest Allom, bigge, weighty, and espe∣cially
<PB N="225" REF="122"/>
if they be round; which is counted such a singular raritie in this Gem, that <HI>Oviedo</HI> tells us of himself, he once bought a Pearl at the Indies, not much bigger than the pellet of some Cross bow, for which he gave 650. times the weight of it in good gold, upon no other special account, but only be∣cause it was round. They fish for Pearls upon all the coasts of <HI>America,</HI> and the Islands ge∣nerally more or less, but especially in the South-Sea about <HI>Panama</HI> and the Island <HI>Mar∣garita,</HI> so called from the aboundance of them which they have found there: and in the North-Sea, about the Islands of <HI>Cumana, Cu∣bagna, Rio de la Hacha,</HI> and other places, which are commonly found bigger than those of the South Sea. And although it be the opi∣nion of some, grounded upon the covetous∣ness of the Spaniards, when they first came in∣to those parts (who spared not the very feed or mother of the Pearl it self, but swept &amp; took all that came to hand) that the profit of Pearl-fishing is much decayed, of what it was; yet if it be true what the same <HI>Oviedo</HI> tells us, I should think it may be otherwise, and the trade good still. For he saith, These Pearl-Oysters come by shoals successively into the places where they are usually taken; and that
<PB N="226" REF="123"/>
though a bank in the Sea be swept never so clean of them by the Pearl-fishers, yet not far off they finde alwaies more, and likewise in the same place good plenty of them again in a short time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the generall division of the <HI>New World</HI> into Continent and Islands; and of the two parts of the Continent, <HI>viz.</HI> the Nor∣thern and the Southern.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Merica,</HI> or the <HI>New World</HI> (as we have said before) is it self most generally thought to be but an Island (though a very huge one) and to be sur∣rounded on all parts by the Sea: not only on the East, West, and South, (as is already found by experience) but also towards the North; where it is likewise supposed to be divided from the Continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> by the Sea running between. Nevertheless for distinction sake, and by reason it is of such a vast extent, as that it equalleth and far exceedeth any other part
<PB N="230" REF="125"/>
of the World, how great soever, that is count∣ed or called Continent, it seems not amiss to express the whole under this division, <HI>viz.</HI> of Continent and Islands: understanding by the first, <HI>viz.</HI> Continent, only the main Land, or more principall Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> which lye united together, and extend themselves, in one continued tract, from the Northern to the Southern borders; and by the latter, the Islands which lye about the main Land, and, though some of them at a good distance from it, yet as well by reason of situation, as for that they were discovered and conquered at the same time with the other, are generally taken and reckoned for part of the <HI>New World.</HI> That which we call the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> is divided generally into two parts, which are two great <HI>Peninsulas,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emy-Islands, envi∣roned on all parts by the Sea, save onely in the midst; where they are joyned together by a certain Isthmus, or neck of Land, which they call <HI>the Streit of Darien,</HI> lying almost under the Equinoctial Line, in some few degrees of Northern latitude: which runneth in length from the district of <HI>Panama,</HI> as they call it, and <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to the Southward, about an hundred miles or more, but in bredth from East to West, or from the North to the South
<PB N="231" REF="125"/>
Sea, is nothing answerable; being in some pla∣ces not above seventeen or eighteen miles over. These two <HI>Peninsulas</HI> are generally counted the Northern and Southern parts of <HI>America;</HI> so called from their situation, in respect of the Equator: the one of them lying wholly Northward of the Equinoctiall Line, and the other, at least for the greatest part of it, South∣ward. They contained anciently (beside many huge and vast Provinces, governed, for the most part, by Royteletts, or certain pettie Princes in each respective Province or Terri∣torie, whom they called <HI>Casiques</HI>) two great and mightie Kingdoms; the one of <HI>Cusco,</HI> ge∣nerally called the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> in the Southern part; and the other of <HI>Mexico,</HI> now called <HI>new Spain,</HI> in the Northern: of both which, and likewise of the manner of the first conquering and subduing of them by the Spa∣niards, when time was, something shall be said in due place.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Mexican, or Northern part of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> containeth these several Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Estotiland,</HI> 2. <HI>Canada,</HI> or <HI>New France,</HI> 3. <HI>Virginia,</HI> 4. <HI>Florida,</HI> 5. <HI>Califormia,</HI> 6. <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> 7. <HI>New Spain,</HI> or <HI>Mexicana</HI> properly so called; and lastly 8. <HI>Guatimala,</HI> together with some other lesser Islands, so neerly ad∣joyning
<PB N="232" REF="126"/>
to the Continent, that they are usually reckoned for part of it, by those which de∣scribe the Countrie; and therefore shall be mentioned in their several places accordingly, <HI>viz.</HI> as parts of the respective Provinces upon which they lye. The Peruvian, or Southern, part containeth these which follow, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Castella del oro,</HI> as the Spaniards call it, or golden <HI>Castile,</HI> 2. <HI>Nova Granada,</HI> 3. <HI>Peru,</HI> 4. <HI>Chile,</HI> 5. <HI>Paraguay,</HI> 6. <HI>Brasil,</HI> 7. <HI>Guiana,</HI> and lastly <HI>Paria,</HI> or new <HI>Andalusia,</HI> as some call it. The Islands which lye further off from the main Land, but yet reckoned commonly for part of the <HI>New World,</HI> by reason they were discovered, as hath been said, and for the greater part conquered and subdued with it, are chiefly those called 1. <HI>Los Ladrones,</HI> 2. the Islands of <HI>Salomon,</HI> which lye in the South Sea: and in the Northern, 1. the <HI>Caribee Islands,</HI> 2. <HI>St. John de Port-rico,</HI> 3. <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> 4 <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> and 5. <HI>Cuba;</HI> of all which in their order, according to the method of the latest, and, as I presume, the exactest Cosmographers, <HI>viz.</HI> of our learned Countriman Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> and his Author <HI>Laet:</HI> upon whom I must profess to rest very much in this part of my report, especially as to the site and position of Places.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Estotiland,</HI> and the several Provinces which it containeth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe first Province of the Continent of <HI>America</HI> towards the North, is called <HI>Estotiland;</HI> for what reason I must plainly confess, I cannot so cleerly discover; unless perhaps our Neighbours the Duch happened to have the first naming of it, and that it beareth any signification of its Easterly lying in respect of the other Provinces. It containeth all those Regions of the Mexican or Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> which lye fur∣thest toward the North East: on which side, as likewise more directly Eastward, it is wash∣ed all along with the main Ocean, or North-Sea; having on the South <HI>Canada,</HI> or <HI>new France:</HI> Westward, and to the North-west, it is not yet fully discovered: but supposed either to be joyned to some parts of <HI>Tartary,</HI> or (which I think is the more common con∣jecture to be divided from it by the Sea: which some, presuming it to be but a narrow Sea, call <HI>the Streits of Anian,</HI> from a Province or part of the <HI>Asiatique Tartary,</HI> which beareth
<PB N="234" REF="127"/>
that name, and lyeth upon it. On the North it hath a Bay, or large Inlet of the Sea, which the English call <HI>Hudsons Streites</HI> from Capt. <HI>Henry Hudson</HI> an Englishman, who in the yeare 1610 is said to have sailed in this Sea no less then three hundred leagues Westward, in search of a passage that way to the Kingdomes of <HI>Catha</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> of which we have spoken already, and which was so much endeavoured in those times both by our selves and our neigh∣bours the Duch: but without success hither∣to. The whole Province containeth these par∣ticular Countries, if I may so call them, or Prefectships, as some others doe, <HI>viz.</HI> First, <HI>E∣stotiland</HI> more properly so called. Secondly, <HI>Terra Corterialis.</HI> Thirdly, New-found land, and Fourthly certain Islands neer adjoyning to the Continent, which they call <HI>Bacca∣leos.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Estotiland</HI> specially so called, is the most Northerly region of all <HI>America</HI> towards the <HI>East,</HI> lying betwixt the abovesaid <HI>Hudsons Sreights,</HI> which it hath on the <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> on the <HI>South.</HI> The soil of the country is said to be reasonably good, and well stored with naturall Commodities, I mean, such as are of necessity and may be expected in such a cold northerly quarter, as Flesh, fowl,
<PB N="235" REF="127"/>
and good store of Fish in the Sea. Among the Natives of the country there, and some Savage that live wild up and down in the Woods, and go naked, not withstanding the extream cold: but for the most part, they are supposed at least to be more civill. The first discoverers of the country reporting of them, that they both sow corn, brew Beer and Ale, use <HI>Canoas</HI> or little Boats at Sea, by which they trade with <HI>Greenland, Freezland,</HI> and other parts at one thousand or five hundred miles distance from them. They are said likwise to have some use of letters, but of a Character proper only to their own Nation, and not understood by any o∣ther people beside themselves. Yea they talk likewise, as if they had some knowledge of the Latin tongue; and of certain Latin books in a Library of one of the Kings of the Country: wherein, if there be any thing of truth, (as I hold it not altogether impossible) 'tis likely, some people from the more Northerly parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that understood the Latin tongue, might in times past be cast on shore, or suffer Shipwrack upon those Coasts; where being constrained to live and abide, they might leave some books, and other monuments of the Lan∣guage behind them in the Country after their decease. However it be, this seems more cer∣tain,
<PB N="236" REF="128"/>
by the report and experience of some English, that the people are generally here found to be more ingenious, to have better judgement in things, and to be much more skilfull in divers Mechanicall arts, then usually in these other parts of <HI>America</HI> they were at first. Among other things they were observed to use a kinde of Dart, or short Ja∣velin, pointed with bright steel and very sharp: which being a kinde of Weapon used only by the people of <HI>Java,</HI> and some other of the Islands of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> it is conjectured, that they have commerce one with another: which seems not altogether improbable. But as for the Towns, Citties and great Castles a∣mong them, which some speak of, and of the Temples, wherein they sacrificed men, (though that be an ancient and generall custome among the Americans, and those of this Country bar∣barous enough to doe it) yet the Reader per∣haps will be willing to suspend his beleefe a while: as likewise he will, for the supposed Mines of gold and silver there: of which (at least as it may seem) the Northerly scituation of the Country doth not well permit us to have such strong presumption. Of Brass and Iron, 'tis likely enough there may be good store, if the Country were scarched. But as
<PB N="237" REF="128"/>
yet the knowledge thereof, especially concer∣ning the more Inland parts; remains very im∣perfect. Some English Adventurers passing that way, have left names to certain Capes or Head-lands upon the Northern Coasts of it, and that is all: the chief of which are these, <HI>viz.</HI> Cape <HI>Elizabeth</HI> at the entrance into <HI>Hud∣sons Streights</HI> Northward. Prince <HI>Henries</HI> Foreland. Cape <HI>Charles.</HI> Kings Foreland with with divers others, more to the <HI>South.</HI> Cape <HI>Wostenholme</HI> and <HI>Digges</HI> his Island about the mouth of the Streight; where it opens it self and disembogues into a large and capacious Bay, called (as abovesaid) <HI>Hudsons Bay,</HI> and dividing these uttermost Provinces of the Northern <HI>America</HI> into two parts, which some call the Eastern and Western point; as may be seen in the Maps. The people of the Country, that are any thing civilized, cloath themselves commonly with Beasts skins, and with the skins of the Sea-calves otherwise called <HI>Mor∣ses;</HI> which are a kinde of Fish of an Amphibi∣ous nature, much abounding in those Nor∣thern Seas, of the bigness of a young Heifer, or Bullock of two yeares old, which they hunt and take in great numbers, especiall where the Whale-fishing is not so good; and draw a good quantity of oile from them, which they
<PB N="238" REF="129"/>
call <HI>Train-oile,</HI> as they doe from the Whale. The flesh of them is counted reasonable good meat, of a taste somewhat like Porke: and on each side of their upper Jaw there groweth out a long tooth, or Tusk, crooked and ben∣ding downward, not unlike to that of an Ele∣phant, each of them a Cubit long sometimes and more, of a substance white and very hard like Ivory; for which it commonly passeth. And it were well, if the deceit rested there, and went no further. For as it seems, there are some that vend it for Unicorns horn and attri∣bute I know not what strange and sovereign vertues to it. An egregious imposture, of which the learned Doctor <HI>Brown</HI> doth likewise (as his manner is) acutely and kindly admonish us. <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>chap.</HI> 23. of his <HI>Psudodox. Epidemio,</HI> above mentioned.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> is a Province, or Country of this Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> ly∣ing Southward of <HI>Estotiland,</HI> and Northward of <HI>New-France</HI> or <HI>Canada,</HI> being so named from <HI>Gaspar Corterialis</HI> a Portughese Gentle∣man, who in the yeare 1500 or there∣abouts first discovered these parts, and gave name to the Country; but did not much be∣side. For returning the next yeare after, with intention to make a further discovery, 'tis sup∣posed
<PB N="239" REF="129"/>
he was shipwracke and drown'd at Sea together with his company; of whom, as <HI>Oso∣rius</HI> in his history of <HI>Portugall,</HI> witnesseth ne∣ver any returned or were heard of: and the like misfortune befell his Brother <HI>Michael Corteri∣alis</HI> the next yeare after; who setting out two Ships to search and enquire of, concerning the fortunes of his Brother <HI>Gaspar,</HI> perished like∣wise in his design, being himself lost and all his men: upon which disasters the Portugheses quite give over the Country, and the French succeed them, naming the Country <HI>New Bre∣tain,</HI> in reference to <HI>Bretain</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which it seemes, was their native Country. This was about the year 1504. The soil of this Country is very lusty and good, for all sorts of grain ge∣nerally, and yeelds a great advantage to the Husbandman, but not without good pains ta∣king in the tillage and managing of it: For which reason it is called by some <HI>Terra di la∣brador,</HI> or the land that requires Labourers; in allusion perhaps to <HI>Terra di lavora,</HI> or the Country of <HI>Campania</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> so called from a like property. The people of the Country, of themselves barbarous and savage enough, are said to be civilized and bettered in their man∣ners by the conversation of the French. They live much upon Fish, are excellent Archers,
<PB N="240" REF="130"/>
jealous of their Wives, and dwell for the most part in Caves under ground; beeing also much given to Soothsaying &amp; Divining; further than which they seem not to have much knowledge, or sence of any thing that concerns religion. The Country was first of all discovered by Sir <HI>Sebastion Cabot,</HI> at the charges of <HI>Henery</HI> the seventh, King of <HI>England,</HI> as hath been said; but it was only discovered, and the design laid wholly aside, by reason of some domestick troubles, and a Warre which the King then had with the Scots: whereupon the After∣comers tooke leave to enter. The Towns or places, which the French have built since, are cheifly, 1. <HI>Brest,</HI> 2. <HI>St. Marie,</HI> and 3. <HI>Cabo Marzo,</HI> as they call it; of which there is little more to be said.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> or <HI>New-found land,</HI> the third part of this Northerly Province of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> is a great Island, lying on the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Corterialis,</HI> from which it is divided by a Frith, or narrow Sea, which the French call <HI>Golf de Chastieux.</HI> This place is chiefly frequented for fishing; of which there is such plenty all along the Coasts of this Island, and likewise of <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> adjoyning to it, that the huge Shoales of Cod-fish doe sometimes stay their Ships under sail: besides great store of other
<PB N="241" REF="130"/>
fish, both of salt water and fresh, as namely Herrings, Salmons, Thornback, Smelts, ex∣cellent Oysters, and Muscles that are said to have a kinde of Pearl in them; but of what quality or value, doth not so well appear. The Land within is likewise reported to be a very good Countrie, plentifully stored with Deer and other sorts of Venison, Phesants, Par∣tridges, Swans, with variety of other good Fowl; lastly of a temperate Aire and Soile, not barren: only the people of it are said to be few, and to inhabit chiefly the Western and North-west parts of it. But this perhaps may be rather out of fear, and to avoid the conversation of Strangers; which at first they would not endure but fled at the sight of them, being themselves altogether Savage and wilde. But since 'tis said, they grow more tractable, and will be hired, in time of yeer, by the Por∣tugheses, and other Nations that fish com∣monly for Whales in the Bay of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and other places thereabouts, to help them in the opening of their Whales, boyling the fish, and drawing out the Oyle; wherein they that will be got to it, are extremely diligent and ready to take pains. They are commonly of but mean stature, full eyed, somewhat broad∣faced, and for the most part beardless. Their
<PB N="242" REF="131"/>
houses are only certain long Poles, set an end sloping upwards towards the top, where they are fastened together, and covered down∣wards with the skins of Beasts, having in the mid'st their hearth, or place to make fire upon. But that which is most remarkable about this Island, is the many and fair Havens which it affordeth on all sides for shipping: in which respect it is though, for the bigness, scarsely to be paralleld by any other Island or Place in the World: not indeed beautified with any great Towns, or stately buildings, as some are, but affording commodious and secure station for the tallest ships that come before it; the chief whereof are these: 1. <HI>La Roigneuse,</HI> or <HI>Rennosa,</HI> as it is called, six leagues Northward of the <HI>Cape Raye,</HI> which lyeth at the South-East angle of the Island; a place much re∣sorted unto for fishing, from all parts. 2. <HI>Por∣tus formosus,</HI> or the fair Haven, three miles Northward of the other; capable of great ships, and bearing at least four or five miles within Land, or more. 3. <HI>Thornbay,</HI> called otherwise by the Portugheses <HI>Enseada grande,</HI> or the great Bay, for distinction sake. 4. <HI>Tri∣nity Bay,</HI> on the North of the Cape <HI>St. Fran∣cis,</HI> called by the Spaniards <HI>Baia de la concep∣tion.</HI> This is likewise a very large and capa∣cious
<PB N="143" REF="131"/>
Bay, five miles over, where it is narrow∣est, having diverse great Rivers falling into it, and some little Islands lying scatteringly up and down in it, yet safe, and affording very good Anchorage and riding for ships in most parts. 5. <HI>Bay Blanche,</HI> as the French call it, or White-Bay, on the North of the Cape or Promontory of <HI>St. John.</HI> On the South side of the Island, and Westward of <HI>Cape Raye,</HI> there is, 1. <HI>Port Trespasse,</HI> an excellent and secure Harbour, having alwaies a reasonable deep Sea, without shallows or Rocks. 2. <HI>Port St. Marie,</HI> six leagues distant from it. 3. <HI>Port Presenza,</HI> by others called <HI>Placenza,</HI> on the other side of Cape <HI>St. Marie,</HI> towards the West. 4. <HI>Port du Basques,</HI> or the Biscayners Haven; and lastly on the West side of the Island, after you have doubled <HI>Cape Raye,</HI> there is at <HI>Georges Bay,</HI> all of them secure sta∣tions, large and of great resort.</P>
<P N="5">5. Before this Island, right over against <HI>Cape Ray,</HI> at a distance of twenty four leagues or more, there lyeth an huge Bank or ridge of Land, extending it self in length, out of the Sea, some hundred of leagues, if my Author mistake not; but in bredth not above four or five and twenty, when it is broadest: and in other parts much less, sharpning towards
<PB N="244" REF="132"/>
each end into a Conus or narrow point. It is counted one of the Marveils of the Sea; which round about it, at some distance, is very deep, and hardly to be sounded, especially betwixt <HI>the Bank,</HI> (for so they commonly call it) and <HI>Cape Ray,</HI> but drawing neerer it grows by degrees more and more shallow; insomuch that nigh the Land, there is not much more water than is necessary for the ships riding. It runneth out in length, as was said, from North to South, from fourty one degrees of latitude to fiftie two; and round about it there lye scattered a multitude of lesser Islands; which Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> when he first dis∣covered, the place called by one common name <HI>Los Baccaleos,</HI> or the Islands of Cod-fish, from the great quantity of that sort of fish hee there found: which was such, that they hindred the passage of his ships, and lay in such multitudes upon the Coasts, that the very Bears would come and catch them in their claws, and draw them to Land. This place, I say, with the rest was first discovered by Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> upon the English account; howbeit the matter happened to be lay'd aside upon the aforesaid occasions; till in King <HI>Henery</HI> the eight his time, it was revived again by <HI>Thorn</HI> and <HI>Eliot,</HI> two Merchants of <HI>Bristoll,</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="132"/>
but without success: after which the Portu∣gheses, French, and other Nations, resort to it and change the names which the first disco∣verers had given to the Bayes and Capes thereabouts. But the English not relinquish∣ing their pretensions of primier discovery and seisin, about the yeer 1583 Sir <HI>Humfry Gilbert</HI> took possession of it again, in the name of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and prohibited all Nations the liberty of fishing there, without the Queen of <HI>Englands</HI> leave. But he being unhappily wracked in his coming home, the business was again discontinued for a time, <HI>viz.</HI> till the year 1608, when it was undertaken a new by <HI>John Guy,</HI> another Merchant of <HI>Bristoll;</HI> and with so good success, that the Colony in a short time were well furnished with Wheat, Rye, Barley, and other grain of their own sowing, with Turnips, Coleworts, and aboun∣dance of other necessary things, not without some probable hopes of Metals, a certain and plentifull trade of Sables, Musk, and other rich Commodities, and such excellent good fish∣ing, especially for Codfish and Ling, that 'tis said some English-men doe ordinarily take two or three hundred of them in the space of three or four houres; which from thence they

conveigh, as a sure and ready Merchandise, into most parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Canada</HI> and the Countries belonging to it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1 <HI>CAnada,</HI> or <HI>New France,</HI> is a large Province of this Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> bounded Northward with <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> abovesaid, and on the South with that part of <HI>Virginia</HI> which is called <HI>New Eng∣land:</HI> on the East it is washed with the Ocean or North Sea; the Western borders of it be∣ing not yet fully discovered or known. It hath its name from the River <HI>Canada,</HI> which wa∣tereth the whole Province, running through the midest of it, and is counted one of the fair∣est and greatest Rivers of <HI>America;</HI> where yet it is suppposed there are the fairest and greatest of all the World beside. It hath its head or spring in those undiscovered parts of this Nor∣therly tract, which remain yet unknown; and runs generally with a large and violent stream, having in it many Cataracts, or falls of the
<PB N="247" REF="133"/>
Water, as it were, from some Rocks lying in the channels which renders the passage of it up the stream extremely difficult, and down∣wards no less dangerous. In some places it swells and spreads it self out into large and huge Lakes, containing, some of them, one hundred miles in compass, and having diverse small Islands scattered up and down in them: after which it is presently again reduced into a narrower channel, of a league or two leagues broad generally. Thus it runneth turning and winding up and down the Country, as 'tis supposed, some hundred of leagues from its head-spring; till at last having received into its channel many lesser Rivers of the Countrie, it empties it self into a great Bay, which they call the Bay of St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> being at the mouth no less thin thirty or fourty leagues broad, as it is said, and one hundred and fifty fathom deep of water. The French Authors report, that it hath been actually searched for above one thousand two hun∣dred miles and upward from the Bay: and that the Savages living thereabouts, doe speak confidently, of certain Bayes of Salt-water more towards the South; and of great vessels which they have seen that way: which, if true, must necessarily be from the South Sea. But I per∣ceive
<PB N="248" REF="134"/>
not that any farther enquiry hath been made by them about it; as doubtless a business of so great importance would deserve, <HI>viz.</HI> to finde such a commodious and easie passage into the South Sea, and thereby to the other Indies. Therefore I suppose those relations are not much credited. The Countrie on both sides the River, is reasonably pleasant and fer∣til, especially on the South or South-west of it; where it seemeth to be a little mountai∣nous, the ground ascending, for the most part upwards from the River, and rising with ma∣ny little hills, clad most of them with Vines, of which there is great aboundance in the Countrie, and other trees, and divided fre∣quently with other lesser streams, which at se∣veral places doe all of them fall into the great River. In this Countrie the French hitherto, I suppose, have made the greatest discoveries of any other Nation; yet not the first, but fol∣lowing the tract of <HI>Corterialis</HI> and Sir <HI>Sebasti∣an Cabot,</HI> that went before them. The whole Country containeth these particular Provinces, or subdivisions, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>New-France,</HI> more e∣specially so called. 2. <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> 3. <HI>Norim∣begua:</HI> and 4. some Islands adjoyning.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>New-France,</HI> specially so called, lyeth on the North-side of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> some∣what
<PB N="249" REF="134"/>
what inclining towards the East; and on the South of <HI>Terra Corterialis:</HI> but in the We∣stern, or more inland parts, the River divideth it in the midst, the French having seated them∣selves on both sides of it. The Countrie na∣turally aboundeth with Staggs, and other sorts of wilde Deer, Bears, Marterns, Foxes, and Hares; of which last there is such plenty, that the French call one of the Islands, <HI>Isle aux Lieures,</HI> or the Island of Hares. They have likewise good store of Conies: Fish and Fowl in aboundance; only they complain the Winter is long, that the Snow lyeth upon the ground sometimes till a good part of <HI>May</HI> be past, and that the North-west winde, especially in Win∣ter, blows very cold there, and brings aboun∣dance of Snow with it. The Countrie hath very much wood; but otherwise of a Soile not unapt for Corne, especially Pulse, and such like grain; of which it affordeth extraordina∣rie increase. But the peculiar Commodity of the Countrie seems to be their Chains of <HI>Esurgnuy,</HI> as they call it, which some say is only a kinde of shel-fish of exceeding white colour; yet found to be of soveraign vertue for the stanching of blood: in which respect they make both Beads and Bracelets of them, and not only use them, but vend them also as a
<PB N="250" REF="135"/>
chief Commoditie; though others, as <HI>Laet,</HI> out of the Commentaries of the French-men themselves, seem to report otherwise, and to describe the use and making of <HI>Esurgnuy</HI> only as a piece of superstition among the Savages, about some dead men. The People, when the French came first among them, were altoge∣ther rude and barbarous, as the most part of them continue still; living generally without houses or any certain places of abode; goe na∣ked, save only that they have a little piece of some Beasts skin bound about their middle. Those about the Sea coasts live most upon fishing; which they practise in certain light boats, which at night they are able to draw to draw to Land, without much help; and but turning the bottom upward, they serve them for an house to sleep in. The Countrie affords good plenty of <HI>Maiz</HI> in many places, but it is said to be the Womens work both to digge the ground and sow it; the Men giving themselves to no kinde of labour, but only of hunting and fishing. Among many other bad enough, they are said to have one vile custome among them, which is, that the young Maidens, when they are fourteen or fifteen yeers old, have leave to prostitute themselves to all Comers; and that they marrie not usually, till they have
<PB N="251" REF="135"/>
thus satiated themselves with promiscuous lust for the space of 4 or 5 yeers together: after which, notwithstanding they take husbands, and prove so extremely loving and constant (if a man could beleeve it) that they never marrie twice, but after their rude manner mourn for their Husbands all their life long.</P>
<P>They have some few Towns; the chief whereof are these, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Hochelaga,</HI> said to be the seat and residence of a King of this Countrie, which at least some of the Natives acknowledge, and exceedingly reverence, car∣rying him sometimes in great pomp upon their shoulders, sitting upon a Carpet of Beasts skins. This Town, if there be any such (for it must be confessed, the reports concerning it are not so certain) is situate far within Land, at a di∣stance of six or seaven leagues from the River <HI>Canada;</HI> and is a kinde of fortified place, encompassed about with a three-fold course of Timber-ramparts one within another, of about two Rods high from the ground, with cross planks or pieces of Timber, laid out on purpose to hinder the scaling, or getting up, by an Enemie. Towards the top there is, as it were, a Scaffold or Gallery framed, from whence they may throw down stones (of
<PB N="252" REF="136"/>
which there is alwaies good store ready) or what else they have to annoy the assaylants. It hath one only Gate for entrance, and that likewise well fortified, after their manner. There are said to be in it fifty or threescore great houses, built, (as the manner of the Ame∣ricans generally is, that use houses) in a square figure, each side being about fiftie foot long or more, and sixteen or twenty broad, but not many stories high; and in the midest of the Court or void space, a place to make their fire, and doe other necessary work about it. The Countrie round about this Town pleasant and good. 2. <HI>Stadac,</HI> or as some call it <HI>Stada∣cone,</HI> another Town of the Natives, not far from the Isle <HI>d' Orleance</HI> Westward. 3. <HI>Que∣beque,</HI> another old Town, which the French, having first expelled the Natives, and made it a Colonie of their own, have since named <HI>St. Croix.</HI> 4. <HI>Tadousac,</HI> a Town lying at the mouth of the River <HI>Saguenay,</HI> having a small Haven, but very safe, and capable of ten or twenty good ships. 5. <HI>France-Roy:</HI> This is little more than a Castle and Fort, built by <HI>Mounsieur Robeval,</HI> a French man, at his first landing there, about the yeer 1540. And lastly <HI>St. Lewis,</HI> a place which the French designed for a Colonie, in the year 1611, un∣der
<PB N="253" REF="136"/>
the command of <HI>Monsieur Champlain;</HI> but it came not to effect, by reason of the Iroquois, a Savage and war-like People on the South-side of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> who doe often trouble and alarme the French in their Quarters, and particularly hindred this Plan∣tation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> or <HI>New-Scotland,</HI> is a part of this Province of <HI>America,</HI> so named by Sir <HI>William Alexander,</HI> a Scottish Gentleman, to whom King <HI>James</HI> gave it by Letters Patents, in the year 1621, being made afterwards Se∣cretary of State for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and after that, by King <HI>Charles,</HI> Earl of <HI>Sterling.</HI> It contain∣eth all that part of the Province of <HI>Canada,</HI> or <HI>New-France,</HI> which the French call <HI>Accadie,</HI> or sometimes <HI>Cadia,</HI> (which properly is only a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> or half Island lying thereabouts) together with so much of the main Land as lyeth between the River <HI>Canada,</HI> and the Bay <HI>Francoise,</HI> that is, reaching from the River of <HI>St. Croix,</HI> upon the West, to the Isle of <HI>Assumption</HI> in the East. This was done pre∣sently after that Sir <HI>Samuell Argall,</HI> Gover∣nour of <HI>Virginia,</HI> had outed the French of all their possessions on the South-side of <HI>Canada,</HI> that is, such as lay within the bounds of <HI>Vir∣ginia</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> where they had not
<PB N="254" REF="137"/>
any thing to doe; much less to molest and make-warre upon such people as lived quietly under the protection of the English. But the Patentee after sometime, finding that to plant and maintain Colonies, was no business to be undertaken by a single person, sold <HI>Port-royall,</HI> which was the principall place he had there, to the French, and wholly discontinued his en∣deavours in the rest, which the French there∣fore have since possessed.</P>
<P>The places of chief importance in this Coun∣try are, 1. <HI>Port-royall</HI> above mentioned. This was first a Colony of French, planted there, by <HI>Monsieur de Montz</HI> about the yeare 1604. but being destroyed by the English from <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> about the yeare 1613. it was granted to Sir <HI>William Alexander;</HI> who as we heard, sold it back again to the French, and they took possession of it the second time, and upon a∣nother account. Howbeit, if report speak true, as the affaires of the world are alwais uncer∣tain, it is now again very lately taken from them by some English, commanded by Major <HI>Sedgwick.</HI> It hath a reasonable good Haven belonging to it, of a mile broad and more within, and two miles in length: the mouth or entrance being somewhat narrower, but neere upon a mile over. 2. St. <HI>Lukes Bay,</HI> so
<PB N="255" REF="137"/>
named by the Colony which Sir <HI>William Alex∣ander</HI> sent thither; but by the French <HI>Port au Mouton,</HI> or Sheeps Bay. 3. <HI>Gaspe</HI> or <HI>Gachepe,</HI> another fair Port right over against the Isle of <HI>Assumption.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. To the Southwest of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and Nothward of <HI>Virginia,</HI> lieth the Country of <HI>Norim begua,</HI> so generally called, and as it hath been thought, from a great City or Town in this Province, or from a River bearing the same name. But as for the first, later discove∣ries finde none such; and as for the River that should be called <HI>Norimbegua;</HI> it is likewise swallowed up in that which is more truely cal∣led <HI>Pemtegovet:</HI> which is indeed a fair River running many miles together in this Tract, but not well navigable above twenty or thirty at the most, by reason of the Cataracts or great falls of water which it hath; and which are an inconvenience incident unto many other Ri∣vers of the New World, and doth make them at severall places unpassable. The mouth of this River is said to be eight or nine miles broad having many little mountainous Islands lying before and about it; one whereof the French call <HI>La Isle haute,</HI> from the great height which it seemeth to beare to them at Sea. Westward of this River <HI>Pemtegovet,</HI> at a di∣stance
<PB N="256" REF="138"/>
of twenty or thirty miles there empty∣eth it self another great River into the Sea, which they call <HI>Quinnebequi,</HI> but the English, as <HI>Laet</HI> reporteth, <HI>Sagadahoc:</HI> betwixt and about which two Rivers the cheif and most known parts of this Country of <HI>Norimbegua</HI> lyeth, saving only a small Southerly Tract up∣on another River which they call <HI>Chovacovet.</HI> The aire of this whole Country is found to be of a very good temperature, and the soil, if it were used, supposed to be no less fruitfull; especially towards the Rivers, and where it is not mountainous or overgrown with Woods, as it is in some parts; where yet it affords much good Timber, abundance of Walnut trees, and of other Nuts, Firre-trees, Beech, with much other necessary and usefull wood: elsewhere there is as much good pasturage and very fair plains; only the Sea Coasts are said to be shallow and full of sands; so that the sai∣ling neer is generally accounted but dange∣rous; and which I suppose, may be some, rea∣son why there occurres not upon these Coasts, any particular Ports or havens, which as yet Authors seem to have thought worthy of their report.</P>
<P N="5">5. There are adjoyning to these parts of <HI>Canada</HI> or <HI>New-France,</HI> cerain Islands, which
<PB N="257" REF="138"/>
although they come not under any one cōmon name, yet it seemes most fit, that we should take notice of them as Appurtenances to this Country. The Principall of these are, 1. <HI>Na∣tiscotec,</HI> or the Isle of <HI>Assumption,</HI> situate in the very mouth of the great River of <HI>Cana∣da.</HI> It was discovered first in the yeare 1534. by <HI>Jaques Cartier</HI> a French man, and con∣tains in length thirty leagues or more, but in breadth not much above seven or eight. The Island is for the most part very plain and level, and of a soil fruitfull enough if it had Inhabi∣tants: plentifully stored both with fowl and fish, having convenient roades but no very good harbours for Ships to stand and abide in. 2. <HI>Rameae.</HI> These are, as it were, a Fry of Islets, or lesser Islands, lying together in the great Gulf or Bay of Saint <HI>Lawrence,</HI> on the South-side of <HI>Natiscotec;</HI> being a place much resorted to by the French, for the <HI>Morsefishing</HI> in time of the year, of which we have spoken something already. They are so numerous up∣on these Coasts, that a small French Bark, 'tis said will catch one thousand or five hundred of them in a few houres; and so large, fat, and unctious withall, that of the bellies of five or six <HI>Morses,</HI> they make an Hogs-head or more of <HI>Trane-oile,</HI> as good as that which they have
<PB N="258" REF="139"/>
of the Whale; beside the benefit of their flesh, which they say, especially if it be young, is as tender and sweet as Veale. The skins of them they dress, as we doe our Oxe-hides; and they say, they are twice as thick and serviceable up∣on any occasion. 3. <HI>Brion,</HI> a small Island South∣ward of the <HI>Rameae,</HI> not above two or three leagues in length, and about so much likewise in breadth, but of a rich Soil and excellent good pasturage, though shaded in some places with many tall and lofty trees of severall kindes; having another lesser Island neighbour∣ing upon it, which they call <HI>Isle Blanche,</HI> or the white Island, of like fertility with it self. 4. <HI>Insula Britonum,</HI> or <HI>Isle Breton,</HI> called also sometimes the Isle of Saint <HI>Lawrence.</HI> This lyeth to the South-East of the Isle <HI>Brion,</HI> of a Triangular forme, containing about eighty leagues in compass, mountainous for a great part of it and rugged, but in the Valleys more fruitfull and pleasant; having no Rivers, at least not any that are much known, but instead thereof, embraced much with armes of the Sea, and thereby not unlik∣ly to be well stored with fish upon the Coasts of it. In the midst of the Country there is a great Lake, which containes within it many lesser Islands. The Woods well replenished
<PB N="259" REF="139"/>
with most sorts of Deere, a kinde of black Foxes, and aboundance of the American Birds, which they call <HI>Pengwins.</HI> The chief Port, or Haven of it is New-port, called by the French <HI>Port aux Anglois,</HI> because much frequented by the English in regard of the fishing. Lastly, there is the Isle <HI>de Sable,</HI> so called by the French, as 'tis supposed, from the Sands which lye so much about it, containing about fifteen leagues in compass, and distant from <HI>Breton-Isle</HI> not much less than twenty or thirty lea∣gues; held to be of an unsafe landing, by rea∣son of the said sands lying about it: and there∣fore though the planting of it hath been twice attempted by the French, and once by the Por∣tugheses, yet the business never had success.</P>
<P>The Inland parts of this whole country of <HI>Canada,</HI> are still in the hands of the Savages or Natives, and not much discovered further than to know the names of the people: the chief whereof that occurre, are these, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Iro∣quois,</HI> a stout and warlike people on the North∣east of <HI>Norimbegua,</HI> often molesting the French. The <HI>Souriquois</HI> and <HI>Etechemins</HI> in the Country of <HI>Accadie,</HI> or <HI>New-Scotland,</HI> who are more their friends, and doe help them som∣times against the <HI>Iroquois.</HI> Beside on the banks, and about the River of <HI>Canada,</HI> there are the
<PB N="260" REF="140"/>
<HI>Algoumequins,</HI> the <HI>Algoiugequins, Quenon∣gebins, Attagopautans,</HI> and many other Mon∣tagnets of such harsh names, that we should be enforced almost to pass them over in silence, though they otherwise deserv'd to be named: only this we may observe in the general, of the Savages of these parts of <HI>America, viz.</HI> That as ignorant and barbarous as they are, yet they have made shift to discover the Factions, Emu∣lations, and Enmities than are amongst the Eu∣ropean People that come thither; and are able to make such advantage of it, by siding some of them with the one, and some with the other, that they all preserve their liberty by it: So that as yet the footing which either the French, English, or any other Nation have among them, seems rather to be for the security of their own abode and trading where they live, than to give them any absolute right of pos∣session; much less any general command of the Countrie.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Virginia</HI> and the Countries thereto be∣longing.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>VIrginia,</HI> so named by Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> about the year 1584, in honour of our Maiden Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of famous Memorie, is a fair Province of this Northern part of <HI>America;</HI> bounded on the North with <HI>Canada,</HI> on the East with the Sea called <HI>Mare del Nort,</HI> on the South with <HI>Flo∣rida;</HI> the Western confines of it being not yet known; but supposed, and perhaps not altoge∣ther improbably, to extend themselves as far as the South Sea. The more inland parts of the Countrie are mountainous and somewhat barren; but otherwise thick set with Woods, and those as well replenished with wild Beasts, Venison, and a sort of People, not much less wilde and savage than Beasts: the Maritime parts more plain and fruitfull. The whole Countrie extends it self from North to South, that is to say, from the Southermost parts of <HI>Norimbega</HI> to <HI>Florida,</HI> full ten degrees of la∣titude, <HI>viz.</HI> from thirty four to fourty four, containing thereby inclusively six hundred
<PB N="262" REF="141"/>
common or English miles: being sub-divided into three inferiour Provinces or Parts, which are these, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>New-England,</HI> 2. <HI>Novum-Belgium,</HI> or <HI>Neiw-Nederlands,</HI> as our Neigh∣bours call it. And 3. <HI>Virginia,</HI> properly so called: to which, because it is an English Plantation, and a part of this Western World, it shall not be amiss to add the <HI>Bermudae</HI> Islands.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>New-England</HI> is that part of this Pro∣vince of <HI>America</HI> which lyeth next to <HI>Canada,</HI> or <HI>New France,</HI> by which it is bordered to∣wards the North, Eastward with <HI>Norimbegua,</HI> on the South and South-west with <HI>Niew-Ne∣derlande:</HI> the other borders, that is, directly Westward, remaining yet unknown. The Coun¦trie lyeth about the middle of the Temperate Zone, betwixt the degrees of fourty one and fourty four, being naturally of the same degree of heat with <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> parallel to which it lyeth in the Western Hemisphere; but yet these heats so moderated and allayed by the coldness of the adjoyning Seas, that the Coun∣try generally is found very agreeable to English bodies. The Soil abundantly fruitfull, not only of the natural Commodities of the Place, but likewise of all such as are transported thi∣ther out of <HI>England.</HI> Great store of Woods and Trees both for Fruit and Building; plenty
<PB N="263" REF="141"/>
of Deer; and of Turkies, Partridges, Swans, Geese, Cranes, Ducks, and Pigeons, so great aboundance, as serve the Inhabitants almost to excess. But the Commodities whereby they chiefly maintain their Trade, are rich Furres, many sorts of good Fish, some quantity of Amber, Flax, Linnen, Iron, Pitch, Masts, Ca∣bles, yea and timber for Shipping. In a word, it is supposed by those which seem to under∣stand the Country well, That there is little coms for <HI>England</HI> by the way of the Sound, but might be had from hence, at easier rates and less trouble, if the busines were well considered. The Natives of the Countrie are said to be much better disposed, more tractable, docil, and apt to be perswaded to civility, than their Neighbours; especially when they are fairly dealt withall, and not provoked into distemper by rough handling. The Countrie on the Sea side replenished with very good Havens. They report, that in the space of 70 miles, there are no less than twenty or twenty five good and secure ports, some of them capable of five hundred or a thousand sail of ships, and fenced from the fury of windes and Sea, by the inter∣position of certain Islets, which, to the num∣ber of two hundred at least, are said to lye scattered up and down upon that Coast.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="142"/>The places where the English have chiefly seated themselves, are, 1. <HI>St. Georges Fort;</HI> where the first Plantation was setled, at the mouth of the River <HI>Sagahadoc,</HI> in a kinde of <HI>Peninsula</HI> or half-Island. 2. <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> seated no less commodiously upon a large and spacious Bay, called by the Natives <HI>Patouxet.</HI> It consisted at the first building but of nine∣teen Families only, but is now improved into a handsome Town. 3. <HI>New-Bristoll,</HI> upon the Sea side also, but lying more Northerly than <HI>Plimouth.</HI> 4. <HI>Barstable.</HI> 5. <HI>Boston:</HI> And lastly <HI>Quillipiack,</HI> which by the name seems to have been some old Town of the Natives, who upon a great mortality happening among them, are said to have diserted these parts of the Countrie but a few years before the Eng∣lish came thither: It lyeth upon a Bay called the Bay of the <HI>Massachousetts,</HI> and is at pre∣sent possessed by the English.</P>
<P>This part of <HI>Virginia</HI> was first discovered by Captain <HI>Gosnold,</HI> in the year 1602. Four years after that King <HI>James</HI> granted it by Let∣ters Patents unto a Corporation of certain Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants to be planted by them and managed to the best ad∣vantage of the Publique: In which Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> Lord chief Justice of the Common-Pleas,

being one of the principall, by his encouragement, and chiefly also at his charge a Colony was sent thither in the year 1607, under the Presidencie of Captain <HI>George Pop∣ham,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Raleigh Gilbert:</HI> but the Presi∣dent <HI>Popham</HI> dying the next year after, and not long after him the Lord chief-Justice like∣wise, who was the chief Patron of the work, the Colonie returned home: and though af∣terwards it was attempted several times, yet never could they finde success in their endea∣vors, nor be setled in any form, till the year 1620: When, by the building of <HI>New-Pli∣mouth,</HI> and some more particular care had of the business, by several incouragements sent from thence to bring on others, and by reason of some domestick motives which perswaded many people to leave their Countrie and goe that way, it is grown at last to a very probable and hopefull condition of good subsistence for the future, being, for many temporal re∣spects, worthy of all favour and cherishing by the State.</P>

<PB N="266" REF="143"/>
Plantation there about the year 1614: The Countrie, as they said, being then void, and therefore free for any body that would take possession of it: Notwithstanding which pre∣tence, they were scarse warm in their Quar∣ters, when Sir <HI>Sam. Argall,</HI> Governour of <HI>Virginia,</HI> having first spoyled the French in <HI>Accadie,</HI> as we said, disputed the possessi∣on with these also. And although they plead∣ed <HI>Hudsons</HI> right (who by Commission from King <HI>James,</HI> and upon an English account, had lately discovered those parts) and pre∣tended they had not only bought all his Cards and Maps of the Countrie, but all his Interest and Right also, and had fully contented him for all his pains and charges in the discovery; yet the said <HI>Hudson,</HI> being an English man, and acting all that he did, by Commission from the King of <HI>England,</HI> upon debate it was concluded, That the Land could not be alie∣nated after discoverie, without the King of <HI>Englands</HI> consent; especially it being but a part of the Province of <HI>Virginia,</HI> already pos∣sessed by the Subjects of <HI>England:</HI> So that they were forced to wave that title, and the Dutch Governor submitted his Plantation to his Majestie of <HI>England,</HI> and to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> for and under him: Upon which
<PB N="267" REF="143"/>
Terms, for a good while, they held it. After∣wards, upon confidence, it seems, of a new Governour sent from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> they not only failed to pay the promised contribution and tribute, but fell to fortifie themselves, and to entitle the Merchants of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to an absolute Propriety and Dominion of the Countrie, independent of any other; building Towns, as <HI>New Amsterdam,</HI> raising Forts, as <HI>Orange Fort,</HI> neer that branch of the <HI>Nordt River,</HI> which they call <HI>Hell gates.</HI> Complaint whereof being made to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and by his Embassador represented to the States, they disown the business, and declare by publique instrument, that they were not interessed in it, but that it was only a private undertaking, <HI>viz.</HI> of the West Indian Company of <HI>Am∣sterdam.</HI> Whereupon a Commission was granted to Sir <HI>George Culvert,</HI> made Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to possess and plant the Southern parts thereof, lying towards <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> by the name of <HI>Maryland;</HI> and to Sir <HI>Edmund Loyden</HI> to plant the Northern parts towards <HI>New-England,</HI> by the name of <HI>Nova-Albion:</HI> Which makes the Dutch the second time seem willing to compound; and for the summe of two thousand and five hundred pounds, they offer to be gone, and leave all
<PB N="268" REF="144"/>
they had there. But by advantage of the troubles in <HI>England,</HI> which then began to ap∣pear, and soon after followed, they not only goe back from their first Propositions, and make higher demands, but also most mischie∣vously and wickedly (as some report) they furnish the Natives with Arms, and teach them the use of them, as it may be thought, expe∣cting to use their help, upon occasion, against the English. An Act questionless of very per∣nicious consequence, not only to the English Adventurers, who have since been much damni∣fied and prejudiced by the said Natives in their Plantations, but also to the Dutch themselves; who, as 'tis reported, were the first, or with the first, that smarted by it: The Savages, being thus arm'd and train'd, first of all falling foule upon them, destroying their Farm-houses, and forcing them to betake themselves to their Forts and Fastnesses: So that at present there is but little good account can be gi∣ven further of the State of this Coun∣trie.</P>
<P>As to the nature and quality of the soil, it differeth not much from the parts about it; the temperature of the aire and commodities of the Country being generally the same, which <HI>New-England</HI> or <HI>Virginia</HI> yeeldeth. And as
<PB N="269" REF="144"/>
for Towns and places of abode, it doth not appeare, that either the English or Dutch have as yet set themselves much to building in this Country. What the English had done before our late troubles at home, it may be feared, is wholly ruined by the misfortunes which befell them there: And for the Dutch, although they make large reports of the Country, and chal∣lenge a huge Circuit of land under the name of the <HI>New-Netherlands,</HI> and title of the States; yet I suppose they have had their hands so full of other business of late, that they have not added much to what they had, when our troubles began; which was only <HI>New-Am∣sterdam,</HI> as they call it, and <HI>Orange-Fort,</HI> afore mentioned; nor is it so certain, whither they be Master of them at this day or no. In stead of Rivers, which this Country seemeth a little to want, there are many large and capacious Bayes all along the Coast: the principall whereof are, that which the Dutch call <HI>Nasso∣vius-Bay,</HI> sometimes the <HI>Nordt-river,</HI> which falleth by it into the Sea at <HI>May-port.</HI> 2. <HI>Hell∣gate,</HI> which is but a Channell of the great <HI>Nordt-river,</HI> so called by reason of its difficult and dangerous entrance; though within it a∣ffords a very safe road for shipping, and fifteen or sixteen fathom of water at the mouth.
<PB N="270" REF="145"/>
3. <HI>Zuid-river,</HI> so called because it lieth more Southerly than the rest.</P>
<P N="4">4. But <HI>Virginia</HI> properly so called, is in a bet∣ter condition. This is an elder Daughter of Eng∣land, &amp; one of her first Plantations, w<SUP>ch</SUP> having endured diversitie of fortunes, and strugling for a long time at the beginning with ill successes, is at last by the favour of Divine Providence arri∣ved unto such a competent happiness, as that the Colonie are said to live very comfortably and helpfully among themselves, and to give good hopes of perpetuating, and improving their condition to posterity. The Country hath on the North-east of it <HI>Niew-Nederlandt</HI> aforesaid, on the South-west <HI>Florida;</HI> the name of <HI>Virginia,</HI> which before was common to the whole Province, being, upon the Plantation of <HI>New-England</HI> and that other, restrained to this part of the Country only, which rea∣cheth from the thirty fourth to the thirty eighth degree of Northern latitude. The Country somewhat inclined to heats; which yet are much moderated by those Constant Easterly windes, which they call <HI>Brises,</HI> and by some other cooling blasts from the Ocean ever and anon. It is a Country generally well distinguished into Hills and Valleys: the first whereof are well cloathed with Woods, and
<PB N="271" REF="145"/>
the latter with Fruits. The soile being so good, that 'tis said in many places, an acre of land well husbanded will return two hundred bu∣shels, or twenty five quarter of good grain: rich in veins of Allom, as likewise in Pitch, Turpentine, Oile, plenty of sweet Gummes, and severall sorts of plants for Dyers use: not wanting many good Mines of Iron, Copper, &amp;c. Timber and tall Cedar-trees in infinite abundance; much Cattle: Fish and Fowl of all sorts: no scarsity of <HI>Maiz</HI> among the Na∣tives; on the mountains some Christall is found, and on the Shore Pearls. To be short, excepting those metalls of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI> (of which I hear not, that any discoveries as yet have been made in these parts) it seems not deficient in any thing, that may encourage or reward an industrious people. The Country not half peopled with Natives; and those that are there found, as much differing one from another in size, as in language and manners. There are some, whom they call <HI>Sasques-Hanoxi</HI> of such a vast bulk and stature, that they seemed, as it were Gyants to the English themselves; others, whom they call <HI>Wigcoco∣moci,</HI> so little and low, that in companie with the other they seem'd but so many <HI>Pigmies:</HI> but the generality of them, it must be confessed,
<PB N="272" REF="146"/>
are taller and well limb'd, though most com∣monly without beards. Their cloathing is mantles of Deer-skins with something like an apron hanging before them. They paint their bodies and faces all over with figures of Ser∣pents and other horrid creatures, 'as tis thought, only that they may seem terrible to their enimies, who are so wise as to fright them again as much with the same. These of <HI>Virgi∣nia</HI> are held to be crafty and revengefull, and not a little more industrious and active, than other Natives, especially towards the <HI>North.</HI> There is no Country in the world, for the big∣ness, better watered than this part of <HI>Vir∣ginia</HI> is, with many pleasant and fair Rivers: the cheife whereof are these, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Pawhatan,</HI> so named from a principall Roytelet of these parts, whose Territores are divided and won∣derfully fertilized by this River, which runs a course of an hundred miles, navigable all the way, at least by smaller Vessels, and falls into the Sea with a mouth two or three miles broad. 2. <HI>Nansamund.</HI> 3. <HI>Pammanuke.</HI> 4. <HI>Toppaphanock,</HI> navigable one hundred and thirty miles. 5. <HI>Pawtunxet,</HI> of a deeper Chan∣nell than any of the rest, and affording variety of choice fish, with divers others.</P>
<P>The English first setled their Plantation
<PB N="273" REF="146"/>
upon the South-side of a large and goodly Bay, called by the Natives <HI>Chese-peack,</HI> which thrusting it self a good way up into the Coun∣trie, and receiving into its bosome many par∣ticular Rivers, yeelds a very safe station for ships, and is the only entrance into this part of the Countrie: The Capes or Points where∣of are therefore well fortified, particularly Cape <HI>Henry,</HI> Cape <HI>Charls, &amp;c.</HI> The Towns which the English have built, or doe frequent in way of Trade, are chiefly 1. <HI>James-Town,</HI> so named by the first Adventurers, in honour of King <HI>James:</HI> it lyeth on the South side of the Bay, and was first built in the year 1606, but since fortified with a Trench drawn round about it, and some pieces of Ordinance plant∣ed. 2. <HI>Henricopolis,</HI> or <HI>Henries Town,</HI> so na∣med from Prince <HI>Henrie,</HI> then living, built in a very convenient place more within Land, about fourscore miles distant from <HI>James-Town.</HI> 3. <HI>Dales-guift,</HI> so named, because built and planted at the charges of Sir <HI>Thomas Dale,</HI> Deputy Governour of the Countrie, about the year 1610. There is also <HI>Ketough∣tan,</HI> a Town of the Natives upon the Bay, where the English are said to frequent and trade much. And lastly <HI>Wicocomoco,</HI> a Town of <HI>Powhatans,</HI> one of the chief Roytelets of
<PB N="274" REF="147"/>
the Country, as hath been said, whom the En∣glish, at their first comming thither, courted much, and procured a Crown of Copper, with some other richer presents, to be sent him from King <HI>James,</HI> on purpose to oblige him: which yet they were hardly able to doe. For although he professed likewise on his part very much love and affection to the English, yet partly by his procurement, as 'tis said, and partly through their own overmuch security, not with out some provocations given on the part of the English, there were, about the year 1621 no less than three hundred and fourty English∣men murdred by the Savages, unexpectedly fal∣ling in upon them, and with such violence and resolution, as that if a certain Native of the Countrie, become Christian, had not disco∣vered the business a very little before to them at <HI>James-Town,</HI> their principall Fort and place of strength had been surprized, and the whole Colony almost at the mercy of the Savages. But it pleased God to prevent their utter de∣struction by that means: And since that time, I suppose they stand better upon their guard.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Bermudas</HI> are a multitude of small Islands in the Atlantick or North-Sea, as at the Indies they call it, lying right over against
<PB N="275" REF="147"/>
<HI>Virginia,</HI> at a distance of four or five hundred miles. They lye from thirty to thirty two de∣grees of Northern latitude, in form of a Crois∣sant, or half-Moon; being so called from <HI>John Bermudaz</HI> a Spaniard, who first discovered them. But the principall of them, and that which is most properly called <HI>Bermudaz</HI> Island, lyeth at the lowest and most Southerly corner of them, in the latitude of thirty two degrees, and twenty five minutes. They are sometimes called <HI>the Summer Islands,</HI> from Sir <HI>George Summers;</HI> who, in the year 1609. in company of Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> and about one hundred and fifty persons more, sailing towards <HI>Virginia,</HI> hardly escaped a terrible shipwrack upon these Islands: the ship, which they were forced to run on shore, being lost, but the men and much of her lading, by Gods great mercy, saved by their Boats. They found the place altogether desolate, inhabited neither by Man nor Beast, save only some Swine in the Woods; but of Fowle such infinite plenty, that they would take a thousand of some one sort as big as Pidgeons, in 2 or 3 houres; with these and the Swine they found there, which were very large and fat, for the most part of the time they stayed, and with variety of fish they sustained themselves happily, till they had
<PB N="276" REF="148"/>
built a new Ship and a Bark, sufficient to wast them and their Company over to <HI>Virginia.</HI> They found likewise diverse sorts of fruits in the Islands, very pleasing and good: aboun∣dance of Mulberry trees and Silk-worms. <HI>Pal∣mitos,</HI> Cedar-trees, and others; on the Sea coasts some quantity of Pearls, Amber-greese, and other good Commodities, an Aire gene∣rally so temperate and agreeable to their con∣stitution, that they reioyced not a little in their misfortune, which had cast them upon a place so likely to be advantagious to them∣selves and the Nation: as by their earnest pro∣curement it hath since in part proved: it being at this day one of the chiefest Plantations of the English: and though as yet they seem to trade only in Tobacco, as likewise <HI>Virginia</HI> is said to doe; yet it is not through any defect either in the one Countrie or the other, as if they afforded no better Commodities, but ra∣ther through the fault and unskilfulness of the Planters, who busie themselves only in those ordinary and easie Commodies, and neglect the improvement of better, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Silk-worms and of making Silk. The first Co∣lonie was sent thither in the year 1612, under the command of Captain <HI>Rich. Moore;</HI> which prospered so well, that in a few years the whole
<PB N="277" REF="148"/>
Island, (<HI>viz.</HI> the principall one) where they doe chiefly inhabit, was divided into <HI>Cantreds,</HI> or Hundreds, as we may call them, and to every Hundred a Burrough or chief Town assigned, and the Government setled entirely according to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> In the year 1623 there were no less than three thou∣sand reckoned to be there, ten good Forts erected, and about fiftie pieces of Ordinance planted upon them: although the place it self is so naturally fenced with Rocks and little Islands lying about it, that the Inhabitants, in that respect only, seem to contemn all dan∣gers from without: it being almost impossible, without particular knowledge of the passages, for a Vessel of but eight or ten Tuns to come safely into Harbour: and yet with such know∣ledge there is both easie passage and secure station for the tallest ships.</P>

<P>Of Florida.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. SOuthward of <HI>Virginia,</HI> somewhat towards the West, lyeth the large and spacious Countrie of <HI>Florida,</HI> enobled hi∣therto
<PB N="278" REF="149"/>
rather by the great pains which the Spa∣niards have taken, and the ill successes which they have met with in the discovery and search of this Province, than by any thing else they have discovered in it answerable to their de∣sires. On the East it hath the Atlantick Oce∣an, or <HI>Mare del Nordt.</HI> On the South and some part of the West, the Gulf of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and on the rest of the West, part of <HI>New-Gal∣licia,</HI> and some other Countries, not yet per∣fectly known. It was first of all discovered by Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> (as hath been said) at the charges of the King of <HI>England,</HI> about the yeare 1497; but afterwards more throughly searched into by <HI>John de Ponce,</HI> a Spaniard, in the year 1512, and by him named <HI>Florida,</HI> because he first landed upon it on Palm-Sunday, which, as they say, the Spaniards use to call <HI>Pascha de Flores,</HI> or <HI>Pascha Florida.</HI> The Countrie lyeth in the same parallel with <HI>Castile</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and is supposed to be of a neer temperature with it, both for Aire and Soil: only this of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> is supposed to be somewhat the more fertil and lusty, as not having as yet been worn out with Tillage and use, as the other hath. They have great plenty of <HI>Maiz</HI> in this Countrie, which they both sow and reap in less than four Moneths space; and which is
<PB N="279" REF="149"/>
somewhat more observable, among People otherwise barbarous, it is not counted among them any mans private possession; but laid up in publique Granaries and Barns out of which it is orderly distributed at all times to parti∣cular persons and Families, according to their necessity. Its well stored likewise with diverse sorts of Fruits, both proper to the Country, and common to other parts; especially with a kinde of Plum of a rare colour and taste, Mulberry trees, Cherry trees, Chesnuts, Grapes, &amp;c. Beasts they have in aboundance, both wilde and tame, with no less plenty of Fowl. Many huge Forests and lesser Woods, well repleni∣shed with good Okes of the largest size, lofty Cedars, Cypress, and Bay trees, with extraor∣dinary plenty of that wood which the Ame∣ricans call <HI>Pavame,</HI> and the French <HI>Saffasras,</HI> the bark whereof is said to be very Medicinal in sundry Diseises, especially for the Stone, and all obstructions of Urine, Winde-Colick, and others; and therefore much used by the Apothecaries. They have also another sort of wood called <HI>Esquine,</HI> not unknown in other parts, affirmed to be of soveraign and present remedie against the <HI>Lues Venerea;</HI> a Maladie which the Indians are said to be generally, and not seldome very fouly subject unto: yea they
<PB N="280" REF="150"/>
say, that the Spaniards from the Indies first brought it into <HI>Italy</HI> and other parts of <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI> where formerly it was either not at all or at least not much known. 'Tis likewise thought, that the Country is not altogether without Mines of Gold and Silver, especially about the mountains <HI>Apalatei,</HI> as they call them, though neglected by the Natives, till the Spaniards came and rifled so strangely for Gold in the other Provinces; which probably might make the Natives of this Province to conceale theirs, when the Spaniards were among them; and still to forbear the search∣ing after it (in case that indeed they have any) only that they may not be troubled with such Ghuests. But for Emralds, Turquoises, and other fine Stones, it is certain, the Countrie hath many, of great worth and beauty: but the plenty of these make them cheap at the Indies, and to be thought not worth the search∣ing after. The People of this Countrie are somewhat of the largest size and stature, in re∣spect of other Americans generally, yet well proportion'd withall, going for the most part naked, only with some skin of a Stag, or other Beast, tyed before them. Their hair black and let to grow; so that in many of them it hangs down as low as their thighs. Cunning they
<PB N="281" REF="150"/>
are said to be, and great dissemblers; stomack∣full, and much given to revenge: which is the cause that they are seldome, but in warre, one with another. One thing, they say, there is pe∣culiar to this Country of <HI>Florida, viz.</HI> that it breeds aboundance of Hermaphrodites, more than any other part of the world beside: whom they likewise use most hardly, making them carry their burthens and luggage like Beasts, and putting them to all kinde of Drudgery.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Country is generally plain and level, having few or no mountains at all in it, save only the <HI>Apalatei,</HI> supposed by the Natives to have rich Mines of gold in them, and which the Spaniards saw, but had not time nor other necessarie accommodation to stay and search them; by reason they were so much wearied and wasted with a long March, before they gat thither, and found the People so stout and obstinate thereabouts, that in stead of enter∣taining them with their Hens and Fowl as other places had done, they were welcom'd with blows, and made to return, leaving not a few of their best Soldiers behinde. Rivers there are many, and those very large and com∣modious, as namely <HI>Rio Secco,</HI> or the <HI>dry Ri∣ver,</HI> so called by the Spaniards (as some think)
<PB N="282" REF="151"/>
because they could finde no gold in it. 2. <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> or the great River. 3. <HI>Ligeris.</HI> 4. <HI>Ga∣runna.</HI> 5. <HI>Sequana, &amp;c.</HI> These last, so named by the French, who, after the Spaniards, for some time had, but never held any long possession of the Countrie. There are also <HI>Rio de Flores, Rio de Nieves, Rio de Spirito Santo,</HI> lesser streams, yet all of them with the rest, falling at several places into the great Lake of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and some of them, not a little haunted by the <HI>Caymans</HI> or West-Indi∣an Crocodiles, a Creature, as hath been said before, dangerous both at Sea and Land. The Country hath not yet been so well discovered, much less conquered or subdued by those who pretend themselves to be Masters of it, as to be distinguished into any certain Provinces. The Natives, who as yet hold possession and command of it for the most part, are them∣selves generally sorted into certain Tribes or great Families; all which are governed seve∣rally by a chief of their own, whom they call <HI>Paracoussi;</HI> and by reason thereof, are almost continally in feud and warre one with ano∣ther. The Provinces or parts of the Country, that I finde any way mentioned by Authors, with any account at all of their situation and bounds, are only these, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Panuco.</HI> 2. <HI>Co∣las:</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="151"/>
And 3. <HI>Tegesta,</HI> or <HI>Florida,</HI> properly so called. The first lyeth on the borders of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> beyond the Bay called <HI>de Spirito Santo.</HI> The second neer the Point or Cape called <HI>Cape Florida.</HI> The third being that long <HI>Peninsula</HI> or half Island which pointeth upon the Isle <HI>Cuba,</HI> and streatcheth it self out North and South an hundred leagues or more in length; but is not in bredth above thirty where it is largest, and in many parts much less: well known by the Cape called <HI>Los Martyres,</HI> which looketh (as it were) into the Isle <HI>Cuba,</HI> and the River of <HI>the Holy Ghost,</HI> with three other goodly Bays, which open and empty themselves into that of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> or the Gulf of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Towns and places most known in this Province, are Saint <HI>Helens,</HI> seated on or neer unto a Promontorie of the same name, where this Country bordereth on <HI>Virginia.</HI> 2. <HI>Fort Charls,</HI> or <HI>Arx Carolina,</HI> built and so named by the French in the reign of <HI>Charls</HI> the ninth their King, but afterwards ruin'd by the Spaniards. 3. <HI>Port-royall,</HI> a well frequented Haven, at the mouth of a river which beareth the same name. More within land there is, 1. <HI>Apalche,</HI> an old Town of the Natives, for∣merly a place of great resort; now a poor
<PB N="284" REF="152"/>
thing of about some fourty or fifty Cottages: and yet as poor as it is, <HI>Pamphilus Narvaez</HI> a Spaniard; at the time when he searched the Country, found the Natives not willing to part with it. For though he took it from them, it was not without some resistance, and they quickly recovered it again: and at 2. <HI>Aute,</HI> another old Town of theirs, nine dayes march from the other, they overtook him, and fell so resolutely upon him, that he left not a few of his best Souldiers dead upon the place, and was content himself to march quietly away with the rest. 3. <HI>Ochalis,</HI> a Town consisting of about 5 or 600 Sheds and Cottages likewise of the Natives. 4. <HI>Vittacuche</HI> a Bur∣rough of two hundred Houses. There is also on the Eastern shore of this <HI>Peninsula</HI> St. <HI>Matthewes,</HI> a place possessed and well forti∣fied by the Spaniards; and Saint <HI>Augustines</HI> on the same Shore, but lying somewhat more Southerly than the other, at the mouth of a River called likewise Saint <HI>Austins.</HI> This latter was taken and sack'd by Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in the yeare 1585. who took out of one only Fort, called Saint <HI>Johns,</HI> no less than eighteen pieces of Brass Ordinance, and twenty thou∣sand Florens in ready money, which was in∣tended for the pay of the Garrison.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="285" REF="152"/>4. This Country is not much inhabited ei∣ther by Spaniards or French, though both suc∣cessively have had it in possession: For <HI>Ponce</HI> a Native of <HI>Leon,</HI> as hath been said, first dis∣covered the <HI>Peninsula</HI> upon Palm-Sunday, 1512. but did no more than only scowre along the Coasts, and give some names to the Pro∣montories, Rivers and places of note which he met with. After him, <HI>Vasquez de Ayllon</HI> with some Ships from <HI>Hispaniola</HI> fell in with the more North-east parts of the Country to∣wards <HI>Virginia,</HI> but did no more than get some few of the Natives, (and that treacherously, as some say, having first invited them on ship∣board, to dinner and upon pretence of traf∣fique with them) with whom he presently re∣turned for <HI>Spain.</HI> If it were so, his practises did not prosper with him; for a few years af∣ter, returning again with a stronger supply of men, and provision to make a further desco∣very of the Country, one of his Ships was cast away upon the rocks, in the same place <HI>viz.</HI> before the Cape Saint <HI>Helena,</HI> and two hun∣dred of his men murdered by the Natives be∣fore his face upon their landing. Nor had the voyage of <HI>Pamphilus Narvaes</HI> before mentio∣ned, any better success in the year 1528. For venturing too farre up into the Country, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="153"/>
to <HI>Apalche,</HI> as was said, (which was a full moneths march from the place of his first land∣ing) out of hopes of some great Treasures there to be found, though at first he made shift to master some of their petty Towns, yet final∣ly he lost both himself and most of his men. Lastly the expedition of <HI>Hernandes a Soto</HI> in the yeare 1543. though more famous than a∣ny of these, yet proved as fruitless as the rest. He began his March in the yeare 1538. and continued it till 1543. over-running the coun∣try with a little Armie of three hundred and fifty horse and 90 foote, subduing the <HI>Para∣coussi,</HI> or petty Princes, where he came, to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> and compelling them to send in their Turkies, Hens and other Fowles, for the victualling of his running Camp, every day: till at last finding his hopes of gold fru∣strate, and a good part of his Army wasted, and the rest much weakned with travell, struck with greife, and (as some say also) with a fea∣ver he died in the midst of his journey, and the remnant of his company, under the command of <HI>Ludevico Muscoso</HI> his Lieutenant, with much difficulty recovered <HI>Mexico</HI> at last. Up∣on so many unsuccessfull attempts, the Spani∣ards seem to leave the Country; whereupon the French enter, sent thither by <HI>Gaspar Co∣ligni</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="153"/>
Admirall of <HI>France</HI> in the yeare 1562, but they were such as the Spaniards liked not to have so neer them: wherefore immediatly upon the landing of a second supply in the year 1565 at <HI>Charls Fort</HI> upon the River <HI>Port-royall</HI> above said, the Spaniards set upon them both by Sea and Land, force their Ships violently upon the rocks, sack the new Town, and put the whole Colony to the sword (scarce one man escaping) together with <HI>Ribault</HI> him∣self, who was Commander in chief for the expedition. There were above six hundred French slain in this Action, and all their hopes in <HI>Florida</HI> thereby utterly extinct. Since that time the Spaniards have better fortified those places of the <HI>Peninsula, viz. Saint. Matthews</HI> and <HI>Saint Augustines</HI> abovesaid; together with the Castles of <HI>Saint Philip</HI> and <HI>Saint Jage</HI> in the more northerly parts of it. But it is like <HI>Aesops</HI> dog in the manger, rather to keep out others, than that they make any good improve∣ment of the Country themselves: and there∣fore if they were beaten out, and sent to at∣tend their Mines and Sugar-mills elswhere, it may seem but just. The Country is a large and goodly Province of <HI>America,</HI> of a fertil and good soil generally, yet neither peopled with Natives, nor used in any sort as it ought, to
<PB N="288" REF="154"/>
the honor of God and the advancement of publick good. What reason or justice there∣fore can it be, that the Spaniards, only by the advantage of a Fort or two upon the Coasts, should pretend to be Lords of the whole land? and neither improve it themselves, as it ought to be improved, nor permit any other Nations, that are willing so to doe? 'Tis supposed in∣deed, they keep it as a reserve of Treasure to themselves, that when they have leasure, or that their Mines at <HI>Potozi,</HI> or other places fail, they may make a further search about the <HI>Apa∣latti</HI> of this Province; of which there are con∣fident reports that they have Mines; and though success hitherto hath not answered their endeavours much, yet they despaire not in due time to finde them, upon an absolute con∣quest of the Country and a more thorough search. And truly their policie and great provi∣dence seems not easily to be condemned: but in the mean time, if any other Nation upon just grounds shall happen to step between and prevent them, they have but little reason to complain, or to count themselves inju∣red.</P>
<P N="5">5. There lie over against the Country of <HI>Florida</HI> westward, or southwest certain small Islands, which because they are but small ones,
<PB N="289" REF="154"/>
and lye so neer the Continent, Geographers sometimes describe as a part and appertaining to the Continent. They are called by a gene∣rall name the <HI>Leucayae</HI> Islands, and have not much to be spoken of them. The cheife are first <HI>Las Tortugas,</HI> or the <HI>Tortoises,</HI> which are se∣ven or eight little Islands lying together at the South-west point of the <HI>Peninsula</HI> called <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> right over against the Port <HI>Havana</HI> of the Isle <HI>Cuba;</HI> from which they are distant a∣bout five or six leagues; and by their lying so scattered up and down in the Sea, as they doe, they make the passage from thence to <HI>Havana</HI> not a little dangerous. Secondly <HI>Los Martire.</HI> These are three great rocks, rather than Islands lying to the South-east of <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> and covered for the most part with a whitish sand and a few bushes growing on them. They seem at a distance to beare a resemblance of men im∣pald, or bound to stakes, as the Martyrs in Pri∣mitive times usually were; which occasioned the Spaniards so to name them. 'Tis very dan∣gerous to come too neer them; but to have sight of them is of great use to men at Sea: For by passing these rocks, and leaving them to the South-east, they certainly know, that they are now <HI>entred the Streits,</HI> not of <HI>Magel∣lan,</HI> which lye many thousands of leagues fur∣ther
<PB N="290" REF="155"/>
Southward, (of which we shall speake in due place) but of <HI>Bahama;</HI> that is, that they have left the Ocean, and are fallen in among those many Islands, which doe, as it were <HI>Bar∣ricado</HI> and block up the Eastern Coasts of <HI>A∣merica</HI> towards <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Terra firma,</HI> as they call it; through which the passage to the Continent is sometimes dange∣rous, by reason of contrary windes; and al∣wayes such, as it requires the skill and care of an experienced <HI>Pilot</HI> to conduct the Ships well thither. Thirdly, <HI>Bahama,</HI> lying westward of <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> famous for nothing but only for giving name to the <HI>Streits</HI> so called, which run betwixt the <HI>Peninsula</HI> of <HI>Florida</HI> and it, with such a violent course and torrent, that although it be above sixteen miles broad, yet many times neither winde nor Oares can pre∣vail against it. Fourthly, <HI>Guanahani,</HI> the first piece of American ground that was disco∣vered, and named by <HI>Christopher Columbus Saint Saviours,</HI> or <HI>Salvador,</HI> as hath been said.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Califormia.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CAliformia</HI> in the generall containeth all those Provinces of the Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> whither discovered or un∣discovered, which lie westward of <HI>Florida, Ca∣nada</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and to the Northwest of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> up to the Streits of <HI>Anian,</HI> or that Sea, which is supposed to divide the Con∣tinent of <HI>Tartary</HI> from <HI>America:</HI> but more especially taken, it comprehends only that large <HI>Peninsula</HI> or Demy-Island (as it seemeth to be) which stretcheth it self from North to South, to a vast length, on the West side of <HI>Mar Vermiglio,</HI> as 'tis commonly called, and sometimes the Bay of <HI>Califormia.</HI> They that take it in ihe first and largest sense, describe under the name of <HI>Califormia</HI> these four par∣ticular Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Quivira,</HI> 2. <HI>Cibola,</HI> 3. <HI>Califormia,</HI> properly so called, and 4. <HI>Nova Albion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Quivira</HI> takes up the most Northern and unknown part of <HI>America</HI> towards the West, reaching as far as the supposed Streit of <HI>Anian</HI> aforesaid (if there be any such) or else
<PB N="292" REF="156"/>
joyning to the Continent of <HI>Tartary.</HI> It is likewise the barrenest and least fruitfull part of all the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> especially for Corn. Cattle it hath great store, and pasturage good; the Countrie being for the most part plain and level, and nothing else but pasturage: The Na∣tives few and Savage; living in Hoards, or great Companies together, after the manner of the Tartars: to whom they are Neighbours; and, as it is not improbably thought, of their race: They cloath themselves (<HI>viz.</HI> the Men) most commonly in that kinde of Oxes hide which we described before, <HI>chap.</HI> 9. under the name of <HI>Taurus Mexicanus:</HI> The Women with little else but their hair; notwithstanding the Countrie, especially for one halfe of the year, is evcessively cold. Their Cattel, though they be much less than the ordinary Kine of <HI>Europe,</HI> are the chief sustenance and imploy∣ment of the Natives; by pasturing of huge Heards whereof from place to place the Peo∣ple live, and maintain a Traffique with other parts. Yet some of them inhabit Towns; the chief whereof, as yet discovered, seem to be these, <HI>viz. Acus,</HI> or <HI>Acuco,</HI> as some call it, a small Town, but seated in a strong defensible place, having some small quantity of Cotton growing about it. 2. <HI>Tignez,</HI> a Town seated
<PB N="293" REF="156"/>
upon the banks of a River, bearing the same name, and inhabited, it seems, by a stout and resolute People, and whom the Spanish, coming among them in the year 1540, had much adoe to Master. They endured a siege for the space of six weeks together; and at last finding themselves so strongly begirt by enemies, that there was no means of escape, but by death or yeelding up themselves, rather than they would fall alive into their hands, they first buried and spoiled all such Treasure as they had (which were chiefly Saphirs, and a few other Gemms that the Countrie afforded) and after that setting fire on their houshold stuff, they took their Wives and Children with them, and made a desperate salley out upon the Spani∣ards; wherein, although they were most of them slain, trod under the horse feet, or drown'd in passing the River, yet was it not without some loss to the Spaniards themselves: Nor would those few that were left behinde deliver up the Town, till it was fired about their ears, and that they could no longer abide in it. 3. <HI>Cicuic,</HI> another small Town four dayes journey distant from <HI>Tignez.</HI> The Countrie about this place, although generally it be all good pasturage, and maintains aboun∣dance of Cattel, yet is it so open and plain,
<PB N="294" REF="157"/>
that for almost one hundred miles together the Spaniards in their march hither from <HI>New-Spain</HI> found neither stone nor tree, nor any thing else that could serve them for a Land∣mark: so that they were forced, as they mar∣ched along, to raise up heaps of the Country Cow-dung, to serve them for direction in their coming back: which was not long after. For, not finding the Commodities they sought for, and fearing to be surprized by Winter in those cold Countries, where they had no kinde of accommodation, they made some∣what a hasty retreat: leaving only behinde them some few Religious men, of the Order of <HI>St. Francis,</HI> whose desires to doe the Peo∣ple good by converting them to the true knowledge and worship of Almighty God, procured them not long after, the Crown of Martyrdom; being murdred all of them save one, by the Natives, and he not without much difficulty escaping their hands.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Cibola</HI> lyeth more Southward of <HI>Qui∣vira,</HI> betwixt it and <HI>New-Gallicia</HI> to the North and North-East: On the West it hath <HI>Mar Vermiglio,</HI> or the Bay of <HI>Califormia.</HI> The Aire of the Province indifferently tempe∣rate, especially if compared to the sharp frosts and colds of <HI>Quivira.</HI> The Countrie, for the
<PB N="295" REF="157"/>
most part level and plain, as <HI>Quivira</HI> is. Few trees at all in it, except here and there some woods of Cedars: which yet doe aboundantly supply the Natives both with Timber and Fuel. The ground affords plenty of <HI>Maiz,</HI> and some small white Pease; of both which they usually make bread. There is great store of Venison, and a kinde of Sheep (as they say, and as it should seem by their Fleece) as big as some little Horse or Oxen; some of their horns weighing fourty or fifty pound. But perhaps, by some mistake of Authors, this Beast may be no other then the <HI>Taurus Mexi∣canus</HI> afore described: whose hair is extreamly thick and shaggie, and of which they make cloath, as of wooll, as hath been said. There are also Lyons, Bears, and Tygres in this Pro∣vince, in such numbers, than the People of the Countrie are not a little troubled with them, and would gladly destroy them, if they knew how. The People are generally well limb'd, tall of stature, and seem to be a little more ingenious than their neighbours of <HI>Qui∣vira:</HI> yet they goe naked many of them, only covered before with Mantles made of skins: which are many times painted, and that with such curiosity and Art, as doe sufficiently ar∣gue, that neither themselves nor their neigh∣bours
<PB N="296" REF="158"/>
of <HI>Quivira,</HI> from whom they have them in traffique, doe make them; but that they are the Merchandise and Commodities of some other Nations, perhaps of <HI>Cathay</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> who, by the North-west Seas, doe trade with the Maritime parts and People of <HI>Qui∣vira.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This part of the Countrie hath been reasonably well searched by the Spaniards, but as yet nothing discovered so considerable as to perswade them to stay in it. That which seems most observable, is the great Lake <HI>Tonteac,</HI> situate almost in the midst of the Province; upon which, or neer unto it, they found seven or eight old Towns of the Natives, some whereof contained four or five hundred of their Cottages or little houses, and were for∣tified also with Ramparts, and other works of defence; so as the Spaniards could not become Masters of them but by force and storming them: in the attempt whereof <HI>Vasquez Caro∣nado</HI> himself, their Commander in chief, was twice beaten down with stones, by the Na∣tives; yet at last carrying the place, he found in it good plenty of <HI>Maiz</HI> indeed, which was some refreshment to his Army, but nothing else: whereupon having named the place <HI>Gra∣nada,</HI> in memory of the Vice-Roy of <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="158"/>
who sent him upon that expedition, he departed. In his return homeward he fell upon a certain Countrie, which he named <HI>Tucayan,</HI> of which his companie report great matters: as first of a certain River called <HI>Huex,</HI> on the banks whereof, in the space of twenty leagues or thereabouts, there stand no less than fifteen good Burroughs well built, and furnished likewise with stoves or hot-hou∣ses, against the cold, as in other Countries of <HI>Europe:</HI> as also of a very fruitfull and pleasant Valley, which therefore they called <HI>Aroya de Corazones,</HI> of another gteat Town and Terri∣torie thereto belonging, called <HI>Chichilticala:</HI> and lastly of the Valley of <HI>Nuestra Sennora,</HI> or our Ladies dale, in the South parts of the said Territorie; all of them described for such rich and delicious places, that some take them for the <HI>Campi Elisii</HI> of <HI>America:</HI> especially seeing the Spaniards were never known to visit them the second time; the discoveries which have been made since, being only of the North-west parts of the Countrie along the coasts of <HI>Mar Vermiglio;</HI> and this no further than only to give name to certain Capes or Pro∣montories which they met with, as namely 1. <HI>Porto de St. Clara,</HI> neer to the mouth of the River which they call <HI>Rio del Nordt.</HI> 2. <HI>Las
<PB N="298" REF="159"/>
Playas.</HI> 3. <HI>St. Michael.</HI> 4. <HI>Lago del oro,</HI> which bordereth on <HI>Quivira:</HI> And lastly <HI>El Rey Coronado,</HI> Eastward of that.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Califormia,</HI> specially so called, is by ma∣ny thought and described to be but a <HI>Peninsula</HI> or half Island, by reason that the Bay which divides it from <HI>Quivira</HI> and <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> towards the North runneth much narrower than it doth Southerly: which made them think, that somwhere or other at the North it was joyned to the main-Land of <HI>A∣merica.</HI> But later discoveries have found it to be a perfect Island, and altogether separate from the Continent. For about the yeer 1620 some Adventurers beating upon those coasts Northward, accidentally, and before they were aware, fell upon a Streit, the waters whereof ran with such a Torrent and violent course, that they brought them into <HI>Mar Ver∣miglio,</HI> whether they would or no, and before they knew it: and by that means discovered that <HI>Califormia</HI> was an Island, and that the waters which were observed to fall so violent∣ly into that Sea, towards the North, were not the waters of any River emptying it self into the Bay from the main-Land, as was formerly thought, but the waters of the North-west Sea it self, violently breaking into the Bay, and
<PB N="299" REF="159"/>
dividing it wholly from the Continent. It lyeth North and South, extending it self in a vast length, full twenty degrees of latitude, <HI>viz.</HI> from twenty two to fourty two; but the bredth nothing answerable. The most Nor∣thern point of it is called <HI>Cape Blanche:</HI> that to the South, <HI>Cape St. Lucas,</HI> memorable for that rich and gallant prize which Captain <HI>Ca∣vendish,</HI> in the year 1587, being then in his voyage about the World, took from the Spa∣niards neer to this place. As for the Island it self, it is not at all inhabited by the Spaniards; whether it be, that they want men to furnish new Plantations, or that they finde no matter of invitation and encouragement from the Countrie; or perhaps that the access thither be not so easie. For 'tis reported to be won∣derfully well peopled by the Natives; and that there were found only upon the coasts and along the shore of <HI>Mar Vermiglio</HI> twenty or twenty three Nations, all of different langua∣ges. The Countrie aboundantly well stored both with Fish and Fowl, as appears partly by the Natives; who take an huge pride in making themselves gay with the bones of the one, with which they load their eares, and sometimes their noses also: and with the fea∣thers of the other, which ordinary People
<PB N="300" REF="160"/>
weare only sticking about their waste; but great persons, and such as will be fine indeed, beset their heads strangely with them, and have cōmonly one bunch of them bigger than ordi∣nary hanging down behinde them like a tayle: Having no knowledge of the true God, they worship what the Devill will have them, that is, the Sun; attributing to it only, the increase of their Fruits and Plants, healthfull Seasons, and most of the other good they enjoy, or are sensible of. Their government is said to be only Oeconomicall, each Father ordering the affairs of his Familie apart, without subjection to any other superiour; yet so well managed, that they live in good peace one with another; not without many good Laws and Customes, <HI>viz.</HI> That they allow but one wife to one Man, That they punish Adultery with death, That they suffer not Maids to talk or converse with Men, till they be married, That Widdows may not marry, till they have mourned at least one half of a year for their Husbands deceased, and divers others of like nature: which perhaps if the truth were known, doe more properly be∣long to the Natives of <HI>Ʋtopia</HI> or <HI>New-Atlan∣tis,</HI> then to these of <HI>Califormia.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The places therein, as yet most observed, are only upon the Sea Coasts, <HI>viz.</HI> the Capes
<PB N="301" REF="160"/>
<HI>St. Clara</HI> and <HI>St. Lucas;</HI> the one at the South-East of the Island, looking towards <HI>New-Gallicia;</HI> the other at the South-west, looking into the Sea and towards <HI>Asia.</HI> 2. <HI>St. Cruce:</HI> This is a large and convenient Haven, not far from Cape <HI>St. Clara.</HI> 3. <HI>Cabo de las Playas,</HI> more within the Bay. 4. <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> ano∣ther convenient Haven upon an Island of the same name. 5. <HI>St. Thome,</HI> an Island at the mouth of the Gulf, or Bay, of about twenty five leagues in compass, rising Southerly with an high mountainous point, under which is a convenient road for shipping, and twenty five fathoms of water. On the other side of the Island, towards the main Sea, there is first <HI>St. Abad,</HI> a good Haven, and almost surround∣ed with a pleasant and fruitfull Countrie. 2. <HI>Cape Trinidado.</HI> 3. <HI>Cape de Cedras.</HI> 4. <HI>Puebla de las Canoas,</HI> from the aboundance of those little Boats which the Americans ge∣nerally use, and doe call <HI>Canoes;</HI> whereof perhaps some store is made there. 5. <HI>Cabo de Galera,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Nova-Albion</HI> is only the more Nor∣therly part of this Island, reaching from the thirty eighth degree of latitude, up towards the North as far as <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> first discovered by Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> in his Circumnavigation
<PB N="302" REF="161"/>
of the World, in the year 1577, and by him named <HI>Nova-Albion,</HI> in honour of <HI>England,</HI> his own Countrie, which anciently bore that name. They found the Countrie exceedingly well stored with Dear, grazing up and down the Hills by thousands in a company: The Men generally goe naked all over, the Women using only a piece of a mat, or some such thing in∣stead of an Apron. Their houses built only of Turf and Osier; yet so wrought together, that they served very well to keep out the cold: in the midst of it is their hearth where they make their fire, and lye al round about it together, upon several Beds of Bulrushes. What their Towns are, or whither they have any, is not yet discovered. When the English first landed in those parts, under Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> the Natives of the Countrie immediatly presented themselves to the General, bringing him fine presents of Feathers, and some K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls of Net∣work made of Rushes: and the news of their arrivall being spread up into the Countrie, it was not long before the King himself came and gave them a visit. He was a person of goodly stature, cloathed all over with certain Conie skins of that Countrie, the furre where∣of is exceeding smooth and fine, and the only Robe of Nobility there. He had many other
<PB N="303" REF="161"/>
tall men attending on him, and one that went before him, bearing somewhat instead of a Mace; at which there hung three Crowns, by so many chains; the Crowns were made of Feathers, the Chains of Bone; both of them very ingeniously wrought. After these fol∣lowed a great multitude of the common sort of People, but none of them without his pre∣sent of something or other, even to the very Boys. The King would needs have the Crowns put upon the Generals head, and the Chains about his neck; to which he consented: and by that Ceremonie promised, in the name and behalf of the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> from whom he said he came, to take them into his protection. So after many other civilities gi∣ven and returned betwixt them, the King at length departed, and Sir <HI>Francis</HI> with his men returned to their ships; having first erected a pillar upon the place; on which he fastned the Arms of <HI>England,</HI> with the Queens name and his own, to remain as a monument of his being there, and of the surrender which was made of that Country to the Queen of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> and the Provinces thereto belonging.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NEw-Gallicia</HI> is the most Norther∣ly Countrie of all <HI>America,</HI> that is inhabited to any purpose by the Spaniards. Here 'tis true, they are scattered up and down in all the parts of it; but it is at a huge distance, and for the most part only where the Mines are. It is bounded on the East and to the South with the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>New-Spain:</HI> on the West with the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Califormia.</HI> Northward, for so much as is yet discovered, with <HI>Quivira</HI> and <HI>Cibola;</HI> lying between eighteen and twenty eight degrees of Northern latitude, that is, from <HI>La Natividad,</HI> a Port so named by the Spaniards, in the con∣fines of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> to the most Northerly borders of <HI>Cinoloa,</HI> a part of this Province; containing, as is supposed, not much less than three hundred leagues in length, and in bredth much more; and whereof not a tenth part is either used or frequented by the Spaniards: The Aire is generally here very temperate, in∣clining rather to heat than cold, and subject
<PB N="305" REF="162"/>
now and then to sodain storms of rain and great claps of thunder; which yet doe not hin∣der, but that the Countrie is held to be reaso∣nably healthfull, and the people observed to live generally to a good old age. The Soil, by reason of the Climate, would be a little in∣clining to drought, but that beside the fre∣quent rains which it hath, it is constantly moistned with fresh morning dews; which make it for the most part wonderfully fruitfull, almost beyond beleef: yeelding for every bu∣shel of Wheat that is sown threescore; and of <HI>Maiz</HI> two hundred for one: beside great plenty of Sugar-Canes and Cochineel; both which, notwithstanding the Spaniards are said to neglect in some sort, imploying themselves wholly about richer Commodities. For the Countrie affords them good store of Mines, <HI>viz.</HI> of Sylver and Brass; but of Gold or Iron, not many as yet have been found: the Rivers plentifully abounding with Fish, and the Woods with Venison and some other wilde Beasts. The Countrie generally more moun∣tainous than plain, frequently shaded with Woods and whole Forrests of the statelyest Pine trees and Oaks of timber that are to be seen. The People are said to be somewhat of a wavering and inconstant disposition, apt to
<PB N="306" REF="163"/>
take offence; and though civilized in some measure, and made Christians by the Spaniards, yet oftentimes upon some light distaste given, they seem willing to return again to their Woods and Barbarism. The reason whereof in part is conceived to be a natural slothfulness and unwillingness unto any kinde of labour in this People; which they labour most of all to avoid, and are so wise, that they never will be brought to it, but upon good wages: but on the contrary, given to sports very much, <HI>viz.</HI> singing, dancing, and drinking out of measure; in so much as 'tis thought, if it were not for their beloved liquor, they would hardly be per∣swaded long to take either the care or the pains of Husbandry. They are of stature reasonably tall, dwelling both in Towns and Villages; be∣ing distinguished into certain Clans or Tribes; each whereof is governed by one <HI>Chief,</HI> but all of them subject to the Judges and Officers of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> It contains in it these in∣feriour Provinces, 1. <HI>Cinoloa.</HI> 2. <HI>Couliacan.</HI> 3. <HI>Xalisco.</HI> 4. <HI>Guadalaiara;</HI> all of them on the Western shore. 5. <HI>Zacatecas.</HI> 6. <HI>New-Biscay:</HI> and 7. <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> more within Land.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cinoloa</HI> is the most Northern part of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> bounded on the West, with some part of the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Califormia:</HI>
<PB N="307" REF="163"/>
On the East with a long ridge of Mountains, which they call <HI>Tepecsuan:</HI> On the North with <HI>Cibola;</HI> and with <HI>Couliacan</HI> on the South. The Country, beside the general fertility of the whole Province of <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> yeelds great store of Cotton-wooll, by reason whereof both Men and Women here are better appareld, for the most part, than elsewhere the Ameri∣cans are. Exceedingly well watered with Ri∣vers, which descend from those mountains <HI>Tepecsuan,</HI> not above thirty or fourty leagues distant from the Sea; and which, with the varietie of their streams and Meandrous gli∣dings, doe divide the Country into many and good pastures, which are likewise stored with aboundance of Kine, Oxen and other Cattel. The chief towns of the Spaniards are, 1. <HI>St. Philip</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> seated towards the Sea side, on the banks of a fair River, some thirty or fourty leagues distant from the town of <HI>Cou∣liacan.</HI> 2. <HI>St. John de Cinoloa,</HI> an ancient Co∣lonie of Spaniards, setled there by <HI>Francisco de Tharra,</HI> in the year 1554, which is all they have in this Countrie; except some few old Forts of the Natives, which they found, after their manner, poorly furnished; but have since repaired them for defense against the Natives of those parts, which as yet remain unreduced.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="308" REF="164"/>3. <HI>Couliacan</HI> lyeth Southward of <HI>Cinoloa,</HI> coasting all along the Bay of <HI>Califormia,</HI> which it hath on the West. On the East it hath <HI>New-Biscay:</HI> and on the South <HI>Xalisco.</HI> The Countrie not defective in any kinde of neces∣sary Provision, more especially aboundeth with Fruits of all sorts: But the Spaniards look only at the Mines; of which they have some few in this Countrie. The People were generally cloathed with Garments of Cotton-wooll, when the Spaniards came first among them, but yet never a whit the more modest; being exceedingly given to Venery, and that in a more shameless and beastly manner, than many other Americans were, that goe naked.

day four great Towns unreduced, though they lye, as it were, in the middle way, betwixt the <HI>Zacatecas</HI> aforesaid, and the Mines and Town of <HI>St. Barbara</HI> of this Province. The Spani∣ards call them <HI>Las quatro Ceinegas,</HI> or the four Quagmires, as lying perhaps in the Marishes, or in some fenny and lower parts of the Coun∣trie. The towns which themselves hold are 1. <HI>St. Barbara,</HI> famous for the rich Mines about it. 2. <HI>St. Johns,</HI> equall to the other, and not above three or four leagues distant from it. 3. <HI>Ende,</HI> the most Northerly town which the Spaniards have in this Countrie, di∣stant about twenty leagues from the o∣ther.

<PB N="315" REF="167"/>
of it, if we may beleeve them, at least in respect of what was generally found in these Northern parts of <HI>America</HI> at their first discovery; as namely, that they have Towns fairly and well built of Lime and Stone, hou∣ses of four stories high, and most of them pro∣vided with stoves for the winter season, as well as any in <HI>Europe:</HI> The streets fair and broad, and the People as curious and expert in divers Arts and Manufactures, as any of theirs. More particularly they tell us of a town called <HI>Chia,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Cuames,</HI> so big, that it is said to contain eight several Market-places. Another called <HI>Acoma,</HI> a great Town, but seated on the top of an high Rock, without any ordinary way of access to it, but by a pair of staires, hewn out of the hard stone; or else by certain ladders which the Inhabitants let down and take up as they please. And likewise of a third, which they call <HI>Conibas,</HI> containing, as they say, no less than seven leagues in length, &amp; about half as much in breadth, seated upon a Lake, but scatteringly built, and much of the space taken up with mountains and many fair Gardens, in the midst of which the Town standeth. This is certain, that the Countrie, to which they give the general name of <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> is of a vast extent, reaching from the
<PB N="316" REF="168"/>
Mines of <HI>St. Barbara</HI> in <HI>New-Biscay</HI> East∣ward and to the North-East above two hun∣dred leagues already discovered, but doubtless taking up no small part of those Countries which are sometimes assigned to <HI>Florida,</HI> if not of the confines of <HI>Virginia</HI> also. The first discoverer of this Countrie was one <HI>Augustino Royaz,</HI> a Franciscan Frier, about the year 1580, by whose report and incouragement <HI>Antonio de Espeio,</HI> a Native of <HI>Corduba,</HI> but then dwel∣ling at <HI>Mexico,</HI> raised, at his own charges, a Band of an 150 Horsemen, and with a competent number of Slaves, Beasts of car∣riage, and other necessaries, undertook the bu∣siness, and discovered many Nations, as the <HI>Conchi, Tobosi, Passaguates, Tepoames, Quires,</HI> and divers others; still marching on till he ar∣rived at a great River, which he named <HI>Rio del Nordt.</HI> Here he made some stay and caused the Countrie on each side of the River to be called <HI>Nova-Mexicana,</HI> and a City to be built, which he likewise named <HI>New-Mexico.</HI> It is seated in the 37 degree of Northern lati∣tude, and distant from <HI>Old-Mexico</HI> four hun∣dred leagues. The name whereof is since changed into that of <HI>St. Foy;</HI> but the dignity of the place improved: being at present the Metropolis of that Province, a Bishops Sea,
<PB N="317" REF="168"/>
the ordinary Residence of the Governour, and hath a Garrison of about two hundred and fifty Souldiers in it, which both commands the Countrie and secures their Mines, of which they have some in the towns hereabouts: the chief of which towns are, 1. <HI>S. Antonio de Sene∣cu,</HI> the first Town which they have upon the <HI>Nordt River.</HI> 2. <HI>Socorro,</HI> so named by the Spaniards from the releefe which they found there both for themselves and Horses, being almost starved with a long march. 3. <HI>Pilabo.</HI> 4. <HI>Siviletta;</HI> all of them old towns, but new named by the Spaniards. 5. <HI>St. Johns,</HI> built some yeers after the first discovery of the Countrie by <HI>John D' Ognate,</HI> a Spa∣niard, who in the year 1599, or there∣abouts over-ran the Countrie a second time with a greater Army, yet pursuing the tract of <HI>d' Espeio,</HI> by which means, having ga∣thered together an infinite mass of treasure, he found no better way to secure it, than by build∣ing this town.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> and its Provinces.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>New-Spain,</HI> was formerly, that is, be∣fore the Spaniards conquer'd and dismembred it, much larger than now it is; for as much as it comprehended the whole Province of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> and reached from the furthest point of the <HI>Peninsula</HI> of <HI>Jucatan</HI> Southward; as far as <HI>New-Biscay</HI> and the confines of <HI>Ca∣liformia</HI> Northward: containing in length seven hundred leagues or more, and about half as much in breadth. But since the con∣quest by <HI>Hernando Cortez</HI> and his followers, the whole Countrie of <HI>New-Gallicia</HI> is taken from it, and made a distinct Government, or <HI>Audiencia,</HI> as the Spaniards call it, of it self. The Natives of the Countrie are of the race of the <HI>Chichimecae,</HI> a savage and wilde sort of People of the Province of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> espe∣cially in the parts of <HI>New-Biscay,</HI> living in Forests and in deep caves under ground; whose posterity doe still at this day much trou∣ble and annoy the Countrie thereabouts; not∣withstanding all the endeavours of the Spani∣ards,
<PB N="319" REF="169"/>
and the Garrisons which they keep in those parts on purpose to destroy them. About five hundred years agoe or more, according to the account of the Mexican Annals, divers Hoards or Swarms of these <HI>Chichimecae,</HI> wea∣ry, it seems, of their Woods and subterrane∣ous dwellings, issued out into the more open Aire, and fell down in huge multitudes into these Southerly parts of <HI>America,</HI> which are now called <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>New-Spain:</HI> not all at once, but at several times, and under seve∣ral names, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Suchimilci, Chalcae, Te∣panecae, Tlascaltecae,</HI> and others; who subdu∣ing or driving out the People they found in those parts, seated themselves in their room: And though at first every Nation or Company of them, as they came, seized upon some Pro∣vince apart by themselves, and held it, as it were, in Soveraignty to themselves, without acknowledgement of any dependance or sub∣jection to their Neighbours, or those that were there before them; yet in tract of time, and by fortune of the Warrs, which they made one upon another, they all fell under the Govern∣ment of one King, <HI>viz.</HI> the King of <HI>Mexico:</HI> which was the chief City of the Province. This Kingdome, at the time that the Spaniards first discovered the Countrie, was governed
<PB N="320" REF="170"/>
by a Prince, named <HI>Motezuma;</HI> one, who by his valour and good success in the warres, had in a few years of his reign, before the Spani∣ards came thither, subdued the better part of a hundred Cities and great Towns to his Do∣minion; and held in actual submission to his Government, and tributary to him, no less than thirty several <HI>Casiques</HI> or petty Princes; every one of which pay'd him Tribute, and were able upon occasion to bring into the field an hundred thousand men. He is said to have been, for his person, a wise and good Prince, just, affable, and tender of his Subjects good: but by reason of some heavy exactions, which his own power and the practise of his Ance∣stors before him, gave him the confidence to impose upon the conquered People, a great part of his Subjects lived but unwillingly un∣der his obedience, and rather by constraint than otherwise: being also further exasperated against him by one barbarous custome, which the Mexicans frequently used, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sacri∣ficing of men. Their manner was, whensoever they had any solemn occasion of doing honour to their Devil-god <HI>Vitzilopuchtli,</HI> as they called him, to send out an Army of men from <HI>Mexico,</HI> into some of the subdued Provinces, (in case they had no enemies neerer hand)
<PB N="321" REF="170"/>
and to fetch in as many men as they thought good, to be sacrificed; whose flesh likewise afterwards they did eate in a solemn Banquet. This being a business of their Satanicall Reli∣gion, and <HI>Motezuma</HI> a Prince extremely su∣perstitious and devoted to the service of his gods, it is said, that he sacrificed commonly, one yeer with another, twenty thousand men, and some yeers, upon extraordinary occasions, not less than fifty thousand: So great and grie∣vous a Tyranny, by the just judgement and permission of Almighty God, for their great and unnatural sins, did the Enemy of Man∣kinde exercise upon them. He was likewise much given to Women; but it was only to such as were counted his Wives; of which he is said to have had no less than one hundred and fifty with child by him at one time.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cortez,</HI> that fortunate Spaniard, who first conquered this rich and mighty Kingdom, soon discovered the discontents and ill affecti∣ons which a great part of <HI>Motezumas</HI> People bare towards his Government; and resolved to make his advantage of it. Where∣fore, being already landed in the Island <HI>Acu∣samil,</HI> or <HI>Cozamul,</HI> as 'tis often called, and having gained his first battel at <HI>Potonchan,</HI> and after that another at <HI>Cintla,</HI> where, with
<PB N="322" REF="171"/>
a handfull of men (not above five hundred in all) some horse, and a few pieces of Ordinance, he defeated an Army of fourty thousand In∣dians, he quickly obliged those of <HI>Zempoallan</HI> and <HI>Tlascaella</HI> to take part with him against <HI>Motezuma;</HI> and by their means divers others: as likewise they did, assisting him both in his first march towards <HI>Mexico</HI> with a com∣petent number of Men, and at the siege and taking of it, with an Army of an hundred thousand: In recompense whereof, they enjoy at this day many great Immunities and privi∣ledges above the rest of the <HI>Americans,</HI> and in a manner equall to those of the Spaniards themselves. <HI>Motezuma</HI> was so frighted with the success of <HI>Cortez,</HI> and with the revolt of so many of his own Subjects from him, espe∣cially upon his gaining a third battel, and sack∣ing of the rich town of <HI>Chololla,</HI> that at the first he freely admitted him into <HI>Mexico,</HI> and soon after without much contestation, acknow¦ledged himself Vassal to the Emperor and King of <HI>Spain;</HI> presenting him in the nature of a Tribute, as much gold as amounted to one hundred and sixty thousand Castlins or pieces of <HI>Castile,</HI> which are said to be nine shillings and seven pence a peece of common money. Nothwithstanding, not long after, upon some
<PB N="323" REF="171"/>
differences growing betwixt the Spaniards and People of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and that a Governor of <HI>Motezumas</HI> in the Country, named <HI>Qualpo∣poca,</HI> had put some Spaniards to death, <HI>Mote∣zuma</HI> was confined to <HI>Cortez</HI> his house, and for the more security of his person, a pair of Gives or Fetters put upon his leggs; although he utterly disclaimed the fact of <HI>Qualpopoca,</HI> and caused him with his Son and some others that were complices in the business, to be pub∣liquely burnt for it in the Market place of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and that by the sentence of <HI>Cortez</HI> himself. The Mexicans, provoked with the injurie and indignity offered to their King, in the midst of his Royal Citie, and in the sight of his People, begin to mutiny and take Arms for the rescue of their Prince. They besiege the Spaniards in their house, together with <HI>Mo∣tezuma,</HI> and press so hard upon them, that the Fetters are taken off, and <HI>Motezuma's</HI> help used for the allaying of the tumult, and quiet∣ing the People: and although they keep him still under guard, yet they permit him to com∣mand and dispatch all affairs, as freely as if he were at liberty; to be attended by his Noble∣men and other Servants, in the full State and dignity of a King; only he went not abroad but some guard of Spaniards were with him.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="324" REF="172"/>3. About this time there were certain ships come to <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> which was a new Port town of this Countrie that the Spaniards had built since their coming thither, and had land∣ed neer upon a thousand men; which was an accident that had like to have spoiled the de∣sign of <HI>Cortez</HI> and all his Company at <HI>Mexi∣co:</HI> these men being sent by <HI>James Velasquez,</HI> Governour of <HI>Cuba,</HI> expressly against <HI>Cortez</HI> and his men, upon pretence that they acted not conformably to the Commission which they had received from him; and gave him no account of their proceedings: which in a great part was true. For it must be confessed, <HI>Cor∣tez</HI> and his men finding themselves to have fallen upon an adventure that was certainly rich and good; and having got such footing and interest in the Country already, by their success and victories, and chiefly by their con∣federacy with so many of the Natives and Peo∣ple of the Countrie revolted to them, did al∣most at first▪ by a general consent, renounce their Commission and dependency upon <HI>Velasquez,</HI> and professed to act immediatly from and for the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> What pre∣tences they had for such a resolution, seemingly at least irregular, is not so well known. What ever they were, they proceed in it, and the
<PB N="325" REF="172"/>
whole company, (excepting only some few who yet went along with the rest) choose <HI>Cor∣tez</HI> anew for their Commander in chief, and appoint likewise, by common consent, all other Officers of Justice, both Civil and Mili∣tary, among themselves: and to give the bet∣ter colour at Court to their proceedings, they send <HI>Portocorrero</HI> and <HI>Monteio,</HI> two of their principalls, into <HI>Spain,</HI> with a rich and huge present, to the Emperour, both to make re∣port of the State of the Country, and to pro∣cure immediate Commission from his Maje∣stie, to proceed: after which they advance to∣wards <HI>Mexico,</HI> as hath been said. <HI>Velasquez,</HI> at <HI>Cuba,</HI> understanding their proceedings, la∣bored to intercept both their Messengers and Present, but could not: and therefore sent <HI>Pamphilo Narvaez</HI> with eleven ships, and about nine hundred or a thousand men, to apprehend <HI>Cortez</HI> and oppose his proceedings. This hapned about the time that the differences were but newly calmed betwixt the Spaniards and the People of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and though it ob∣liged <HI>Cortez</HI> to leave the City in a wavering and unsetled condition, yet he took such or∣der, that <HI>Motezuma</HI> still remained under the guard of the Spaniards, as before, assisted with some thousands of their friends of <HI>Tlascalla;</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="173"/>
and he himself taking the rest and some few Spaniards along with him, with undaunted courage and resolution, marched against <HI>Narvaez.</HI> And such was his good fortune, that not only <HI>Narvaez</HI> became his prisoner, without much bloodshed, but likewise all his Men joyned with him in his designe, through the favour of the Chancery, or supreme Court of <HI>St. Domingo,</HI> and by the procurement of the Licentiate <HI>Vasquez de Ayllon,</HI> a Judge of it, who was sent with <HI>Narvaez</HI> to accommodate the differences.</P>
<P N="4">4. With this recruit <HI>Cortez</HI> marches back again to <HI>Mexico;</HI> but at his comming findes things in a very bad condition. For the Mexi∣cans were now in an absolute Rebellion, and made open warre against the Spaniards; had block'd up those in the Citie, together with their friends the Tlascaltecans, and either stopped up or possessed themselves of all the Avennues by land or water: so that it was some time before <HI>Cortez</HI> could get in with his forces. But at last by advantage of the night, in which the Mexicans never use to fight, nor yet to keep any very good guard, he found a passage, and made shift to bring in his forces, to the great rejoycing and incouragement of his men within, who were very hard put to it
<PB N="327" REF="173"/>
by the numerous Mexicans, and pressed to yeeld themselves, and deliver up <HI>Motezuma.</HI> But upon his coming they took heart again; and he with his fresh Companies sallying out upon the Citizens, easily set them at further distance. But yet their numbers were such, and so infinitely surpassing his, being called in from all parts of the Kingdome not revolted, and their resolution such to destroy or starve the Spaniards, as they would neither admit, nor so much as hear of any terms of Accommoda∣tion; which <HI>Cortez</HI> profered them divers times: their general cry being nothing else, but <HI>Get you hence, deliver up the King;</HI> and calling them <HI>Enemies, Theevs, Robbers,</HI> and what not? and truly the condition of the Spa∣niards was such, and the Mexicans had them so much in their power, if not to kill, yet at least to starve them, by reason of their infinite numbers, which dayly increased, and by being so much Masters of the City both by land and water, and having broken down all, or most of the bridges, by which only there was passage out of it, that the Spaniards would gladly have been gone, if they durst: but they knew, their but offering to leave the City would be their destruction. <HI>Mexico</HI> is built, like <HI>Venice,</HI> upon the water, in the midst of an huge Lake, having
<PB N="328" REF="174"/>
three only waies to enter it by land, which are upon three several Causeys, of a league, two leagues, and half a league long; and of but little breadth: on all other parts it is surround∣ed by the Lake, which by sundry and large Channels enters and waters the Citie in all the quarters of it; where they have draw-bridges to pull up and let down at pleasure. At these passes the Spaniards knew very well they should be over-power'd by their enemies; who by this time were grown so resolute and hardy, that they seem'd not to fear or regard death, but in fight would run desperately in multi∣tudes even upon the mouths of the Ordinance: and doubtless but for the Hors-men, which stav'd them off, they would in a short time have rendred them in a manner useless, and have choak'd them up (as it were) with their own dead bodies. In this hurly-burly and di∣stress the Spaniards, whither by force or other∣wise, procured <HI>Motezuma</HI> (who was yet in their power) to appear above upon a Gallerie, or flat of roof the house, upon a pretence, that he should offer som terms of accomodation from the Spaniards, and to shew himself to be well: But it was in a place where the stones and ar∣rows flew so thick from the enraged multitude below, that <HI>Motezuma</HI> himself received a
<PB N="329" REF="174"/>
wound, by one of them, in his head, so unhap∣pily, that within a few dayes after he dyed of it: as they say, who would not have the Spa∣niards thought to have murder'd him; as the Mexicans say they did, with divers other No∣ble-men, and some of his Children, the very night they fled. However it were, not long after his death, out of extream necessity, and chiefly for want of Victuals, the Spaniards were forced to leave the City in the night time, and with the loss of four hundred and fifty of their men, who were slain or taken priso∣ners at the passing of a draw-Bridge; the rest making a heavy retreat to their friends at <HI>Tlas∣calla.</HI> There is standing at this day in <HI>Mexico,</HI> upon the place where so many of them were killed, a certain Hermitage, which they call <HI>Los Martyres,</HI> or the Hermitage of the Mar∣tyrs; but <HI>very improperly,</HI> saith mine Author, their own Countriman: for what reason I shall not here enquire.</P>
<P N="5">5. This retreat of the Spaniards out of <HI>Mexico</HI> happened to be upon the tenth of <HI>Ju∣ly</HI> after mid-night in the year 1520, which the Spaniards at <HI>Mexico</HI> call <HI>the dolefull night.</HI> Nevertheless the undaunted <HI>Cortez,</HI> being got, though with huge difficulty and trouble, by reason of the pursuit of the Mexicans for a

good part of the way, to his sure friends of <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> neither lost his courage, nor gave over his resolution of yet gaining <HI>Mexico:</HI> especially the way being now laid open, and sufficient occasion given, by the death of <HI>Mo∣tezuma,</HI> and the provocations of the Mexi∣cans themselves, to make himself absolute and sole Lord of the place. Wherefore having sent for, and procured a competent supply of fresh Souldiers from <HI>St. Domingo,</HI> or <HI>Hispaniola, Almeria, Cuba,</HI> and other places, being in all nine hundred Foot, eight hundred Horse, and seventeen pieces of Ordinance, he joyns him∣self with the Auxiliary Forces of <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> which were no less than an hundred thousand men, armed with Bows and Arrows: and with this Army marches again towards <HI>Mexi∣co,</HI> and besieges it both by Land and Water, <HI>viz.</HI> with the help of thirteen <HI>Vergantines,</HI> or Galliots, which he had built upon the Lake, and six thousand <HI>Canoas,</HI> or little Boats, which his friends and confederates had procured him. By which means, and by his Army on Land, in a short time he cut off all Provision from the Citie, and after a siege of full three moneths or more; and a most stout and obsti∣nate resistance made by the People within, in which they are said to have lost above a hun∣dred

thousand men, beside those which perish∣ed by famine, sickness, or otherwise, he took it by force upon tuesday the thirteenth of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> 1521, sackt it first, and then burnt it to the ground: yet afterwards he caused it to be rebuilt again, far more beautifully than at first it was; as in due place we shall further see. They speak not of above fifty Spaniards slain during the whole siege, six horses, and not ma∣ny <HI>Tlascaltecans.</HI> In this manner, and with so little charges to the Conqueror, there fell to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> the richest and goodliest Kingdome (one of them) of the whole World, <HI>viz.</HI> the Kingdome of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which the Con∣querors presently named <HI>New-Spain;</HI> and in reference to which name, the Catholike King hath ever since stiled himself in the plural <HI>Hispaniarum Rex,</HI> or King of both <HI>Spains:</HI> and all by the valour, prudence, admirable re∣solution, and happy conduct of <HI>Cortez;</HI> who was at first but a private Adventurer in the American Plantations and discoveries, though otherwise a Gentleman of a good Familie in <HI>Spain,</HI> born at <HI>Medellin</HI> in the Countrie of <HI>Estramedura.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Charls</HI> the fifth, who was then also King of <HI>Spain,</HI> for his great services endowed him deservedly with many great and rich Territories in the Provinces of

<HI>Tlascalla, Mechoacan,</HI> and other parts there∣abouts, made him Marquis of the Valley, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Guaxata,</HI> (which is his chief Title) a rich and flourishing Province of that Country, Captain General, or Commander in chief, of all the Military forces of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> and Ge∣neral Discoverer of all the Maritime parts and Coasts of <HI>America</HI> towards the South-Sea, assigning him in propriety the twelfth part of whatsoever should be discovered, to him and his Heirs for ever: But denyed him the Go∣vernment of <HI>Mexico</HI> out of reason of State; though 'tis said, he much desired it.</P>
<P N="6">6. The bounds of this Kingdome at pre∣sent are thus. On the East it hath a large Arm of the Sea, which they call the Bay of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> or the Gulf of <HI>Mexico:</HI> On the West it hath some parts of <HI>New-Gallicia</HI> and <HI>Mare del Zur:</HI> On the North the rest of <HI>New-Gal∣licia,</HI> and part of <HI>Florida:</HI> and on the South <HI>Mare del Zur</HI> again, and part of <HI>Guati∣mala.</HI> It extendeth it self in length from the furthest point of <HI>Jucatan</HI> South-East, to the borders of <HI>New-Gallicia</HI> Northward, above one thousand Italian miles; and in breadth from <HI>Panuco</HI> to the South-Sea, about half so much. It lyeth wholly under the Torrid Zone; nor is it a Countrie generally so mountainous

or high seated, as some others of <HI>America</HI> are, but for the most part level or low; yet is it so fanned, for three parts at least of four, by the cooling blasts off the Sea, and the heats other∣wise so moderated with frequent rains, which it hath constantly three moneths in the year, <HI>viz. June, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> that the Aire is rendred thereby exceeding temperate and agreeable, and the Climate not unhealthfull, especially to temperate bodies, and such as be never so little used to it. A goodly Country it is, of inexhaustible wealth and riches; whe∣ther we regard the Mines of Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, &amp;c. of all which it hath many, and very good; or the Fruits of the Earth, aboun∣dance of Cattel, plenty of Corn and Grain, or any other Commodities and endowments of Nature; which serve for the enriching of the World. Among other things it affords good store of <HI>Cassia;</HI> the fruit whereof is a thing well known and much commended by the Apothecaries for its use in Physick, especi∣ally for Purgations, and removing of all ob∣structions of phlegm, cholar, &amp;c. Such store of Balm, Amber, all sorts of Gumms and pre∣cious Liquors, as no Country in the World is better furnished with matter of excellent Perfumes and Physi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, than the Kingdom
<PB N="334" REF="177"/>
of <HI>New-Spain</HI> is; aboundance of <HI>Coco-nuts,</HI> and such plenty of that excellent Dye, called <HI>Coccinele,</HI> that 'tis said, no less than five or six thousand <HI>Arrobes</HI> of Spanish measure (which make above five times so many English Bushels) are yearly transported thence. Good plenty likewise both of Wheat and <HI>Maiz,</HI> with Barley and Pulse of all sorts: All kinde of garden Hearbs, Roots and Plants in so great aboundance, and so admirably thriving, that 'tis scarcely to be beleeved. Whole Woods and Forests, as it were, of Oranges, Limmons, Citrons and other such fruit, as hath been said. Some Cherries; but of Apples, Pears, and Figgs, &amp;c. beyond measure. The Natives of the Country very ingenious in divers Mecha∣nicall Arts, especially in making of feather-Pictures; a piece of curiosity, wherein they are held to be incomparably, or rather inimi∣tably excellent; and so industrious at it, that although the Americans generally be not a People over much addicted to any kinde of labour or study, yet at this they will sit a whole day together, without either meat or drink, only out of a natural affection they have to the work, and a desire to be excellent in it. The Country indeed affords them great variety of Birds, and other Fowl, of most rare and
<PB N="335" REF="177"/>
exquisite colours; which is a great advantage to their skill, and helps much to the accom∣plishment of their work. They paint likewise very curiously upon their Cottons; and are held to be generally the best Gold-smiths in the world; of most perfect skil in the purging and refining of all sorts of Metals, but especi∣ally of Gold and Silver. And yet in other things so strangely stupid and ignorant, that when the Spaniards first appeard among them on Horse-back, 'tis reported, not a few of them took the Horse and Man both for one Cteature; and when the Horse neighed, they would enquire very seriously, what he said. There be likewise many fair Lakes in the Pro∣vince of <HI>New-Spain;</HI> but the principall are those of <HI>Chapala</HI> and <HI>Mexico:</HI> the former of which is in the more Northern parts of the Kingdome, towards the borders of <HI>New Gal∣licia,</HI> and is chiefly famous for the aboundance of good Salt that is yeerly made and transport∣ed thence. The other of <HI>Mexico</HI> is the largest and goodliest (one of them) in the World, of circular form, and containing, as some say, little less than nine hundred miles in comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, invironed with the main Land, the <HI>Peninsula</HI> or Cape of <HI>Florida, Jucatan,</HI> and the Island <HI>Cuba;</HI> having two only passages in and out,
<PB N="336" REF="178"/>
and both of them well fortified: the one be∣twixt the point of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and the Isle <HI>Cuba,</HI> where the tide violently enters; and the other betwixt the said Island and the Cape <HI>Florida,</HI> where it goeth as violently out: upon which Gulf the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath alwaies some good ships in readiness for all occasions; and by them 'tis supposed, he doth more assure his Estates in those parts of <HI>America,</HI> than by all his Garrisons beside.</P>
<P>The whole Kingdome of <HI>New-Spain</HI> is sub∣divided into these inferior Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Panuco.</HI> 2. <HI>Mexicana.</HI> 3. <HI>Mechoacan.</HI> 4. <HI>Tlascalla.</HI> 5. <HI>Guaxata.</HI> 6. <HI>Chiapa:</HI> and 7. <HI>Jucatan.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Panuco</HI> is the most Northerly Province of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> by some called <HI>Guasteca,</HI> bounded on the East with the Gulf of <HI>Mexi∣co:</HI> on the West with <HI>Ʋxitipa,</HI> a Country of <HI>New-Gallicia:</HI> on the North with some un∣discovered Countries of <HI>Florida,</HI> from which it is divided by the River of Palms; on the South with <HI>Mechoacan</HI> and <HI>Mexicana.</HI> It is called <HI>Panuco</HI> from a River of that name; which running from the mountains <HI>Tepecsuan</HI> in <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> and, dividing <HI>New-Biscay</HI> from the Province of <HI>Zacatecas,</HI> passeth through the midst of this Country also, and at last empti∣eth
<PB N="337" REF="178"/>
it self into the Gulf. The Country is reckoned to be about fifty leagues in length, and not much less in breadth; of a fruitfull Soile, having some Mines of gold in it, and once very Populous, till <HI>Hernando Cortez</HI> and the Spaniards, about the year 1522, dispeo∣pled it by their cruelty. The chief towns now remaining and inhabited by the Spaniards are, first <HI>St. Lewis de Tampice,</HI> a Colony of Spa∣niards situate on the Northern bank of the River <HI>Panuco,</HI> at the very mouth of it; where it hath a very large Haven, but so barred with sands, that no ship of any great burden can enter or abide in it with safety; and yet the Ri∣ver otherwise so deep, that Vessels of five hun∣dred tun, might sail up threescore leagues at least within land, and thereby visit the rich Mines of <HI>Zatatecas</HI> on the one side of it, and of <HI>New-Biscay</HI> on the other, at pleasure, and without fear of much opposition. 2. <HI>St. Ste∣van del Puerto</HI> on the South side of the same River, eight leagues distant from the Sea or Gulf of <HI>Mexico;</HI> at present the Metropolis or chief town of the Province, built by <HI>Cortez,</HI> in the place where stood old <HI>Panuco,</HI> which was likewise the Metropolis or head town of the Natives, before the Spaniards burnt and de∣stroyed it. 3. <HI>St. Jago de los Valles.</HI> This is
<PB N="338" REF="179"/>
a Frontier place, and enjoyeth certain speciar Immunities and some fair possessions also fo defense of the Country against the Savages. It is twenty five leagues distant from <HI>St. Ste∣ven del Puerto,</HI> lying in an open or Champain Country, and is fenced about with a wall of Earth.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Mechoacan</HI> hath on the North-East <HI>Pa∣nuco;</HI> on the East <HI>Mexicana,</HI> properly so cal∣led, on the South part of <HI>Tlascalla;</HI> on the West the main Ocean, or <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> and last of all more directly Northward <HI>Xalisco,</HI> which is a Province of <HI>New Gallicia.</HI> The name signifieth in the American language, as much as <HI>a Fish Country;</HI> &amp; so it is, having many fair Lakes and Rivers in it aboundantly well stored with good Fish. The Country so excee∣dingly pleasant and healthfull, that 'tis usuall for sick persons of other Provinces to come hither to recover their health, only by the be∣nefit of a good Aire. The Soil so aboundantly fertil of all sorts of grain, that of four mea∣sures of seed, it hath been often observed, they have reaped the next harvest more than so ma∣ny hundred measures of the same grain. Very well wooded; and by reason of its many Ri∣vers and fresh springs equally rich in good pa∣sture: and beside great plenty of Medicinall
<PB N="339" REF="179"/>
Hearbs and Plants. It affordeth good store of Amber nigh the Sea Coasts, Mulberry-trees, &amp; consequently Silks; much Honey, wax and di∣vers other Commodities, both for necessity and pleasure. The People of the Country are generally tall, of a strong active body, and a good wit, especially in comparison of other Natives: not unskilfull in divers curious Ma∣nufactures; and the most excellent Feather-Picturers, aforementioned, are said to be found in this Province. They seem more generally inclined to the humors and customes of the Spaniards, than many other Americans; and received the preaching of Christian Religion, when time was, with much willingness: so that the Country is now entirely Christian, and di∣vided into several Parishes. There are said to be in it one hundred and fifty Towns or Bur∣roughs (beside many scattered Villages) most of which have free Schools erected in them, for the training up of youth in Christian Re∣ligion, good literature and Arts; and few of them without an Hospitall for the sick, of which towns the principall are such as follow, <HI>viz. Zinzoutza,</HI> the seat of the ancient Kings of <HI>Mechoacan.</HI> 2. <HI>Pascuar,</HI> a City fourty se∣ven leagues distant from <HI>Mexico,</HI> once a Bi∣shops Sea, but now removed to <HI>Valladolit.</HI>
<PB N="340" REF="180"/>
3. <HI>Valladolit,</HI> the Metropolis or chief City of the Province, since the Episcopall chair was removed from <HI>Pascuar</HI> thither. It lyeth upon a great Lake, equall almost for bigness to that of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and is about seven leagues distant from <HI>Pascuar,</HI> towards the East. 4 <HI>St. Mi∣chaels,</HI> a good town, fourty leagues Westward of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and in the way to the <HI>Zacatecas,</HI> but lying in a road that is somewhat dange∣rous, being not a little infested with Savages on both sides of it. 5. <HI>St. Philips.</HI> 6. <HI>La Con∣ception de Salaya,</HI> 17 leagues distant from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and a convenient stage for Travel∣lers; being indeed, with the two last menti∣oned, built chiefly for the defence and securing of the Country against the Savages. 7. <HI>Guaxa∣nato,</HI> a Town on the borders of <HI>Panuco,</HI> where there are very rich Mines of silver. 8. <HI>Le∣on,</HI> another Town likewise of very rich Mines, twenty four leagues distant from <HI>Valladolid,</HI> and threescore from <HI>Mexico.</HI> 9. <HI>Zamorra.</HI> 10. <HI>Villa de los Lagos,</HI> and others. Towards the Sea there is, 1. <HI>Acatlan,</HI> but two miles di∣stant from the Coast, and a small town; yet by reason of a safe and very good Harbour which it hath for shipping, a place of no little trading. 2. <HI>Natividad,</HI> another well known and convenient Haven upon <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI>
<PB N="341" REF="180"/>
pertaining to this Province, and from whence they usually set sail for the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands. 3. <HI>St. Jago de buena Speranza,</HI> so called by the Spaniards, perhaps from the aboundance of good Pearls they found upon this Coast. 4. <HI>Co∣lyma.</HI> 5. <HI>Zacatula,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>This Province, as we said, was at first a di∣stinct Kingdome of it self, yet subordinate and tributary to that of <HI>Mexico;</HI> the King where∣of named <HI>Tamgaivan Bimbicha</HI> (as <HI>Laet</HI> re∣porteth) at the first coming of the Spaniards thither, after the conquest of <HI>Mexico,</HI> volunta∣rily submitted himself to them, and was bapti∣zed. Nevertheless afterwards, upon a pretence of I know not what Treason intended by him against them, and which the Spanish Writers themselves professedly think to have been feigned▪ by command of <HI>Nunnez de Gusman,</HI> President of the Chancery of <HI>Mexico,</HI> he was most inhumanely burnt alive, and the Spaniards seized upon his Kingdome.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Mexicana,</HI> specially so called, is bound∣ed on the East with the Gulf of <HI>Mexico;</HI> on the West with <HI>Mechoacan:</HI> on the North with <HI>Panuco,</HI> and some parts of <HI>New-Gallicia;</HI> and on the South with <HI>Tlascalla:</HI> so called from <HI>Mexico,</HI> which is the chief City of the Province, and of all <HI>America</HI> beside. A large
<PB N="342" REF="181"/>
and rich Country, containing not much less than one hundred and thirty leagues both in length and bredth; and if it yeelds any thing to <HI>Peru</HI> in the plenty of gold and silver, 'tis certain, it much excells it in many other com∣modities: as namely in all sorts of Fruits, aboundance of Cattel, plenty of Corn and Grain; in all which the advantage which this Country hath, not only of <HI>Peru,</HI> but of all the other Provinces of <HI>America</HI> beside, is well known: not to speak any thing of the great plenty and variety of good Fish, which both the Rivers and Lakes of this Country afford, which is very great: insomuch that the very tribute of the one Lake of <HI>Mexico</HI> is said to yeeld an Income of above twenty thousand Crowns yearly, one with another. The Peo∣ple of the Country are generally industrious and active, especially since the Spaniards came among them; rich Merchants, if they apply themselves to it; and they say likewise good Souldiers, when they are trained and imployed that way. The chief towns and places of the Province are, 1. <HI>Mexico,</HI> both anciently and at present the Metropolis and Capitall City; being the seat of an Archbishop, and the or∣dinary Residence of the Vice-Roy and chief Governours of <HI>New-Spain.</HI> Formerly it stood
<PB N="343" REF="181"/>
like another <HI>Venice,</HI> upon the water, being built upon certain Islands within the Lake, and interlaced in all the quarters of it with divers pleasant Currents, both of fresh and salt water. But the old City being destroyed by <HI>Cortez,</HI> as we said, it was rebuilt by him more upon the firm Land, almost upon the banks of the great Lake; (for there are two of them, the one of salt-water, the other of fresh; which continu∣ally ebbe and flow into one another, &amp; contain in the compass of the whole, about thirty leagues or more: upon which there are thought to be not less than fourty or fifty thousand <HI>Canoas</HI> or little Boats continually plying from one Town to another;) and in the midst of a fair Plain, or Champaign Coun∣try, containing likewise, as some say, not less than sixty or seventy leagues in compass, and environed with mountains of so great height, that the tops of them are said to be continu∣ally covered with snow. At present it is thought to be one of the richest Cities of the World, abounding (if reports be true) in all kinde of voluptuous gallantry and bravery, even to excess: It is supposed to contain about six or seven miles in compass, and to consist of above an hundred thousand Houses or Fami∣lies▪ whereof not the tenth part Spaniards: but
<PB N="344" REF="182"/>
those that are, be all Gentlemen, I mean as to their garb and manner of living; for they live most splendidly in all respects, both for dyet and apparel. For the first, we have spoken so much already of the general plenty of all things in the Kingdom of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> that pertain to this part of pleasure, that it is not to be doubted: and for the second this may be some instance, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is no extraordinary matter to see an Hat-band and Role all of Diamonds, in some ordinary Gentlemans Hat; and of Pearl among the common Citizens and Tradesmen. The Coaches (which most Gen∣tlemen keep) almost covered with gold and silver, richly beset with precious stones, and within ordinarily lined with cloth of gold, or the best <HI>China</HI> silk that can be gotten: of which Coaches, in time of year, at the <HI>Alameda,</HI> as they call it, which is, as it were, <HI>the Hide Park of Mexico,</HI> and a place made of purpose for recreation and delight, a man shall observe not seldome, above a thousand or two thou∣sand Coaches, full of Ladies and Gallants coming thither only to take the aire and their pleasure, both the one and the other attended with a numerous train of servants and <HI>Mu∣lattos</HI> of both sexes. In <HI>la Plateria,</HI> which is but one only street in <HI>Mexico,</HI> nigh to the Vice-Roys
<PB N="345" REF="182"/>
Palace, in less than half an hours space, with the turn of an eye, you may see millions of wealth in Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, in the Gold-smiths and Jewellers shops there∣abouts. In a word, there is nothing hinders <HI>Mexico</HI> from being the most absolute Citie in the World for delight and bravery, but on∣ly two inconvinces to which it is subject. The one is the danger of the Lake; with the Infalls whereof it may seem to be almost continually threatned, and in the year 1629, did actually suffer a very great calamity: the waters break∣ing through the banks, and drowning a great part of the City, with the destruction of much People, and the loss of all their goods intirely, through the avarice (as is supposed) of the Vice-Roy that then was, and some other of the Kings Officers, who diverted the money that should have been imployed, for the for∣tifying and repairing of the banks, to their proper uses. The other is from the Nature of the Soil and ground it self, on which the City standeth; which is found to have a tincture of of salt-Nitre in it, somewhat strong; and the windes partly from the Lake it self, and partly from the Hills about it, raising the dust of this earth constantly every evening, for many moneths of the year together, so violently, that
<PB N="346" REF="183"/>
the Aire is even darkned therewith for some time: the Inhabitants are much annoyed by it, and made subject to divers Hypocondriacall pains and infirmities, and sometimes killed with it, especially such as either cannot or care not much to avoid it. The Citie lyeth about 60 leagues or one hundred and fifty miles distant from the Atlantick or North Sea; from whence by the Port of <HI>St. John D'Ʋllua,</HI> or <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> (which are the usuall landing places) there is a fair and easie march to <HI>Mexi∣co,</HI> by the Cities of <HI>Xalapa, Perotta, Puebla de los Angelos,</HI> and <HI>Tlascalla,</HI> all of them open and unfortified places (as likewise <HI>Mexico</HI> it self is) and the Country round about very rich and well accommodated with all things. The second town of this Province is <HI>Tescuco,</HI> an ancient and fair Citie seated upon the same Lake six or seven leagues distant from <HI>Mexico,</HI> to which it yeeldeth not much either for beau-or bravery. 3. <HI>Quitlavaca,</HI> a Citie built wholly upon certain Islets within the Lake, and therefore called sometimes by the Spaniards <HI>Venezuela,</HI> or <HI>Little-Venice,</HI> having one only passage by Land to it, over a Causey of flint∣stone half a league or more in length, and about sixteen or twenty foot broad. 4. <HI>Ʋztacpa∣lapa,</HI> a City of ten thousand Housholds or
<PB N="347" REF="183"/>
thereabnuts, six leagues distant from <HI>Tescuco,</HI> and about twenty from <HI>Mexico.</HI> 5. <HI>Mexi∣caltzingo</HI> a Burrough of four thousand Hous∣holds. 6. <HI>Cuyacan,</HI> of six thousand: All these are seated upon the Lake. Further from the Lake there is <HI>Chololla,</HI> a great Citie and a rich place, not much inferiour-to <HI>Mexico.</HI> Anciently this City was, as it were, the Sanctuary of the Mexican Kings, and the chief place of their barbarous and inhu∣mane Superstitions, where yearly not less than five or six thousand Indian Children of both sexes were sacrificed to <HI>Vitzilopuchtli,</HI> that is, to the Devil. It was likewise the chief burying place of all the Mexican Nobility, whose Tombs and Monuments there afforded the Spaniards at their first rifling of them, an in∣finite mass of Treasure; and yet not half so much, as by report, they both desired and ex∣pected. 2. <HI>Mastitlan,</HI> a Town pleasantly seated upon the top of an huge mountain, in the midst of most delicate Groves and shady Woods round about it, and reckoned to con∣tain not less than thirty thousand Inhabitants in all, dwelling either in the Citie, or upon the sides of the Mountain. 3. <HI>Autepecque,</HI> this is a Town belonging to the Marquiss <HI>de Valle,</HI> who is of the Posterity of <HI>Cortez,</HI> and
<PB N="348" REF="184"/>
said to be seated in the most delicious place of all <HI>New-Spain.</HI> 4. <HI>Acapulco,</HI> a Town seat∣ed upon the South-Sea, or <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> yet belonging to this Province. It is a Haven Town and one of the most frequented upon the South Sea, situate upon a large and capa∣cious Bay of about a league broad at the en∣trance, and affording many convenient stati∣ons and Docks for shipping. At the bottome of the Bay Westward lyeth the Town, with a strong Castle very opportunely built both for the command and security of the Port, well walled and fortifyed with Bulwarks, and ha∣ving a constant Garrison of four hundred Souldiers in it, or thereabouts. The reason whereof I suppose may be chiefly this, <HI>viz.</HI> that from this Port there is the greatest traffique and entercourse held betwixt the East and West-Indies, together with the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands. The Country hath many rich Mines of silver in it, and some of Gold: the chief of which first are by <HI>Herera</HI> reported to be these, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. those of <HI>Puchuca,</HI> fourteen leagues distant from <HI>Mexico.</HI> 2. Of <HI>Tasco,</HI> twenty four leagues distant. 3. <HI>Talpuiana.</HI> 4. <HI>Cultepeque.</HI> 5. <HI>Zacualpa.</HI> 6. <HI>Zupan∣guo,</HI> and divers others.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Tlascalla</HI> is a Province of <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
<PB N="349" REF="184"/>
which extendeth it self entirely from one Sea to another, <HI>viz.</HI> from the <HI>Atlantick</HI> to <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> with which it is bounded on the East and West parts; lying otherwise and for the most part betwixt the Provinces of <HI>Mexicana</HI> last spoken of, and that of <HI>Guaxata</HI> which followeth; containing in length, <HI>viz.</HI> from one Sea to the other, not much less than an hundred leagues, and in some places fourscore in bredth; but towards the South-Sea growing much narrower. It is a Country exceedingly plentifull both of Corn and Cattel, full of rich pasturage, and so plentifully stored with <HI>Maiz,</HI> some Wheat, and other Grain, that it is counted, as it were, the Granary of <HI>Ameri∣ca.</HI> The People of this Country, when the Spaniards first landed among them, lived in the form of a Common-wealth or Free State, refusing to be subject to the King of <HI>Mexico,</HI> with whom they had almost continuall Warre; and upon that account, as hath been said, assi∣sted <HI>Cortez</HI> in the Conquest of the Kingdom: and without whose help 'tis most certain, he had never been able to doe any thing. They enjoy therefore many speciall Priviledges and Immunities, more than other <HI>Americans</HI> doe. They pay no tribute but only an handfull of Wheat yearly for every person, in way of ac∣knowledgement
<PB N="350" REF="185"/>
and otherwise living under the protection of the Spaniards, wholly in the form of their ancient Government. The whole Province is said to contain two hundred good Towns and Burroughs, and more than one thousand Villages, all of them exceedingly populous, and supposed to contain in the whole above a million and half of Natives, be∣side Spaniards, who have some few Colonies in the Country for securing of it. The chief Towns of the Province are, 1. <HI>Tlascalla</HI> it self, which denominates the whole Country as the Metropolis of it. It is a fair town, and com∣modiously seated in the midst of a large and fertil Campaign of threescore miles in com∣pass. It consisteth of four large and beautifull streets or quarters, and in the midest of them where they all meet, hath a <HI>Piazza,</HI> or Market place, equall to that of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and able to receive twenty or thirty thousand persons con∣veniently to buy and sell in it. 2. <HI>Puebla de los Angeles,</HI> or the Citie of Angels, a town built by <HI>Sebastian Ramirez,</HI> a Church-man, and he that was the first president or chief Governour of <HI>Mexico,</HI> under the Crown of <HI>Castile.</HI> It was built in the year 1531, almost in the road way from <HI>Vera Crux</HI> to <HI>Mexico;</HI> and seated in a very delicate and fertil Coun∣try,

It is subdi∣vided into many particular Provinces; which, because they are many and but small, in com∣parison of some other, we may call <HI>Wapentakes,</HI> or Hundreds, rather than Provinces: the prin∣cipall whereof are these that follow, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Misteca.</HI> 2. <HI>Tutepecque.</HI> 3. <HI>Zapoteca.</HI> 4. <HI>Guazacoalco.</HI> 5. <HI>Gueztaxatla:</HI> and 6. the <HI>Vally of Guaxata,</HI> from whence <HI>Cortez,</HI> after the Conquest of <HI>Mexico,</HI> had his title given

him by the Emperor, <HI>Marquess of the Valley.</HI> It is the richest and most pleasant part of the whole Province, extended in a continued tract together full sixteen leagues or more, lying about fourscore Southward of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and wanting neither Mines of gold and silver nor any other of the prime and best Commodities of the <HI>New-World.</HI> The towns of principall note inhabited by the Spaniards in this Pro∣vince are, first <HI>Antequera,</HI> in the Valley afore∣said, a stately Citie, and beautified with a fair Cathedrall Church, built with pillars of the finest Marble, of great height and bigness. 2. <HI>St. Ildephonso.</HI> 3. <HI>St. Jago,</HI> commonly called <HI>St. Jago of the Valley Nexatapa;</HI> yet is it self a City fairly seated upon a Hill. 4. <HI>Del Spirito Santo,</HI> a town built by <HI>Gonsalvo Sando∣vall,</HI> in the year 1526, distant not above three leagues from the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI> 5. <HI>Aguatulco,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Guatulco,</HI> a noted and convenient Haven, or Port-town upon the South Sea, yet pertaining to this Province: A rich place by reason of the trade from <HI>Mexico</HI> to <HI>Peru,</HI> and from <HI>Peru</HI> to <HI>Mexico,</HI> which passeth all through this town. There are reckoned of the Natives of this Pro∣vince not less than six hundred and fifty Bur∣roughs and Villages, and in them above an

<P N="12">12. <HI>Jucatan</HI> is a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> or half-Island, encompassed for the most part with the Sea; save only to the South-west, where it is joyned to <HI>Guaxata:</HI> its farther and more Easterly point looking towards <HI>Cuba.</HI> The whole Pro∣vince contains in compass nine hundred miles or more, the Aire somewhat hot, and the Soil not altogether so fertil in all Commodities, as some other parts of <HI>New-Spain</HI> are: yet are the People therefore more industrious living for the most part by Handi∣crafts and Trades, and much more willing to take pains than their Neigbours. They report some speciall things of this Province of <HI>Juca∣tan,</HI> as namely, that the People of the Countrie used generally, and long before the Spaniards came thither, a certain Ceremony of Religion, not much unlike to our Baptism, and which they called by a name that in their language signified <HI>Regeneration,</HI> or a <HI>second Birth;</HI> that they observed it so diligently, that few or none among them omitted to initiate themselves by it, beleeving, that thereby <HI>the Seeds</HI> and ground-work of all goodness was laid in them, and that they were fortified by it against
<PB N="356" REF="188"/>
the assaults and molestations of evil-Spirits: That after they were three or four yeers old, till they came to twelve, they usually thus washed and baptized themselves; and that none were permitted among them to marry, that were not first initiated after this manner: That they chose likewise a solemn day upon which to doe this; and fasted (at least the Fa∣ther and Mother of the party to be initiated) alwaies three dayes before: and that a great many of the Natives had a Tradition, or ge∣neral report among them, that of ancient time this Province of <HI>Jucatan</HI> was possessed and cultivated by a certain People which came thi∣ther from the East, after a tedious long wan∣dering and many hardships endured at Sea, having escaped the hands of their Enemies only through the power of God, or the Deity they worshiped; who helped them, and made them to pass securely, even through the waves of the Sea. All which, if true, seems not a little to confirm the report which goeth for current in the Welch Chronicles, of one <HI>Madoc ap Owen</HI> the sonne of <HI>Guineth,</HI> a Prince of that Countrie, who is said to have fallen upon a farre Countrie this way in his travels; which he liked so well, that having secured to his Companions their safe abode there, during his
<PB N="357" REF="188"/>
absence, he returned himself into <HI>Wales</HI> for more Men; and that he transported thither as many as he could carry in ten Barks full la∣den. This he is said to have done about the year of our Lord 1170. But neither he nor any of his Men were ever heard of since; and the suc∣cess of the expedition, it seems, little enquired after by the Welch. However the relation seems not altogether incredible, or beyond belief.</P>
<P>The chief towns of the Province are, 1. <HI>Me∣rida,</HI> in the Navil of the Country, and the seat of the Governor, twelve leagues distant from the Sea on either side. 2. <HI>Valladolidt,</HI> thirty leagues distant from <HI>Merida.</HI> 3. <HI>Cam∣peche,</HI> a great town consisting of about three thousand housholds or more, when first con∣quered by the Spaniards; who found such Monuments of Art and curious industrie in it, as did cleerly argue, that the place had been once possessed by some People that were not barbarous. It is now called <HI>St. Francisco,</HI> and was surprized in the year 1596 by Captain <HI>Parker,</HI> an English man, who took the Gover∣nor himself and some other persons of quality prisoners, and carried them away with him, together with a ship richly laden with gold and silver, beside other Commodities of good va∣lue.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Guatimala.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GƲatimala</HI> is the last general Pro∣vince of this Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> and brings us down to the Isthmus or neck of Land, which, as we said, joyneth the Northern and Southern parts of the <HI>New-World</HI> together. This Countrie, <HI>viz. Guati∣mala,</HI> is bounded Northward with the <HI>Penin∣sula</HI> of <HI>Jucatan</HI> abovesaid, and part of the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> on the South wi h <HI>Mare del Zur:</HI> on the East and South-East it hath <HI>Castella aurea:</HI> and on the West <HI>New-Spain.</HI> The length of it lyeth upon the coast of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and is said to be little less than three hundred leagues; but the breadth not half so much in any place, and in some very narrow. It is generally a fertil and good Countrie in all respects, but especially abound∣ing in Cattel and good Pastures: being sub∣divided into six inferiour Provinces or Coun∣tries, which are, 1. <HI>Chiapa.</HI> 2. <HI>Verapaz.</HI> 3. <HI>Guatimala,</HI> specially so called. 4. <HI>Hondu∣ras.</HI> 5. <HI>Nicaragua:</HI> And lastly, 6. <HI>Ve∣ragua.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="360" REF="190"/>2. <HI>Chiapa</HI> is bordered on the West with <HI>New-Spain;</HI> on the East with <HI>Vera paz:</HI> on the North with <HI>Jucatan:</HI> and on the South with <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI> It is a Countrie much shaded with Woods, and those replenished with many fair and goodly trees, of divers sorts and of the largest size, as Oaks, Pines, Cedar, and Cypress trees; besides others which yeeld them a good kinde of Rosin, precious Gumms, &amp;c. It hath likewise good plenty of <HI>Cocchinele:</HI> but as for Mines either of gold or silver, I observe not much to be spoken; the Countrie is supposed to afford some, but hi∣therto no great search hath been made; possi∣bly for want of Labourers to work in the Mines. The only inconvenience which the Countrie seemeth to lye under, is the aboun∣dance of Serpents, or Snakes which it breedeth: there are some of them said to be twenty foot long or more; and doe not a little infest the Natives: who yet are not without a general Antidote or Remedy which the Countrie like∣wise naturally affordeth: which is nothing else but the leaves of some of their trees dryed to powder; of which they make a plaister of soveraign efficacie, as 'tis said, against their venome; and otherwise generally good for any old and inveterate sores.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="190"/>The places of more principall note in this Countrie inhabited by the Spaniards, are 1. <HI>Ciudad Real,</HI> pleasantly seated in the midst of a round Vale or Plain, and almost encom∣passed with Hills round about it, in form of an Amphitheatre; at the foot of one of which, standing in the midst of the rest, the City is built. It is a Citie specially priviledged by the Kings of <HI>Spain;</HI> of a pure and temperate Aire, and the Country about plentifully abounding both in Corn and Fruit. 2. <HI>Chiapa,</HI> which giveth name to the Valley aforesaid; it is a Bishops Sea, and famous, if but for one of its Prelates, <HI>viz. Bartholomaeus de las Casas,</HI> of the Order of Preachers, who was Bishop of this Citie, and his memory justly precious among the poor Americans at this day, for his Charity towards them, and for the stout and zealous opposition which he made against the Spani∣ards cruel and inhumane dealings with the Natives at the beginning of their Conquests: by which at last, notwithstanding much diffi∣culty and resistance made by interessed persons of the other side, he procured them liberty, and an Edict from the Emperor in favour of them; whereby they were declared to be <HI>Free Peo∣ple,</HI> and <HI>not Slaves;</HI> and the Spaniards for∣bidden to use them any longer as such, or to
<PB N="362" REF="191"/>
force them to any kinde of labour against their wills, or otherwise than by agreement with them, which liberty they enjoy to this day; and though the Spaniaiards are said to give them very small wages in some places, and for their work in their Sugar Mills (which is no small labor) not above five Royalls or two Shillings six Pence a week, for the maintenance of themselves, their Wives and Children, yet by reason, it is with their consent, and in a Country where all things are plentifull and cheap: their condition is much better than it was, and the favour which that good Bishop did them, never to be forgotten. It is at pre∣sent a great City and populous, and lyeth al∣most in the middle way betwixt the Cities of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Guatimala.</HI> 3. <HI>St. Bartholomews.</HI> 4. <HI>Tecpatlan</HI> and some others belonging to the Natives.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Vera paz,</HI> or the Country of <HI>True peace,</HI> was so named by the Spaniards, as they say, be∣cause it was never conquered by the Sword, but reduced to obedience only by the preach∣ing of the Dominican Friers. It is bounded on the West and South-west with <HI>Chiapa;</HI> on the East with some part of <HI>Guatimala,</HI> and <HI>Honduras,</HI> and on the North with <HI>Jucatan,</HI> It Containes about thirty leagues length, and al∣most
<PB N="363" REF="191"/>
as much in breadth, being a woody and mountainous Country for the most part, yet well distingushed with Valleys and lower grownd. It is thought to be a little too much subject to rain, which 'tis said to have for nine moneths of the year almost continually; by reason whereof the Country, being other∣wise hot, is much anoyed with a kind of <HI>Mos∣quit,</HI> or great sort of Gnatts, which spoyle the fruit very much, and are otherwise not a little troublsome to the people. The chief Commo∣dities of this Country, are first a kinde of Am∣ber, which some call <HI>liquid Amber,</HI> which drops from divers of their trees, and is said to be a Commodity very precious and of much use. <HI>Mastick, Sazaparilla, China wood,</HI> and divers other Medicinall woods, which it affor∣deth in great plenty. But as for any Towns or places of much Traffique or note, inhabited by the Spaniards; I finde not any named, save only <HI>St. Augustines;</HI> neer unto which, there is said to be a Cave and Fountain within ground, which converts the water that falleth into it, out of several lesser Springs, into a kinde of Alablaster, or stone perfectly white, and fashions it likewise into pillars, statues, and other artificiall formes very curiously, as <HI>Laet</HI> reporteth.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="364" REF="192"/>4. <HI>Guatimala,</HI> specially so called, hath on the West the river <HI>Xicalapa,</HI> which divides it from <HI>Vera paz.</HI> On the East it is bounded with the Country of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> on the North with <HI>Honduras,</HI> and on the South with <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI> The Country by reason of its Neigh∣bourhood with <HI>Vera paz,</HI> not altogether clear of Mountains, but otherwise well watered with Rivers, and enriched with fair and fruit∣full Valleyes, which afford not only good pa∣sturage, and many great heards of Cattel, but likewise good store of Wheate, <HI>Maiz</HI> and o∣ther fruits of the Earth. Great plenty of Cot∣ton-Wooll, generally both here and in the o∣ther Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Vera paz, Chiapa, &amp;c.</HI> some medicinall woods likewise and liquors; and absolutely the best Sulfur of <HI>America.</HI> The people generally tractable and well dispo∣ed, both in poynt of Religion and Civill Go∣vernment. The Towns of cheif note are, 1. <HI>Guatimala,</HI> otherwise called <HI>St. Jago de Guatimala,</HI> the cheif City of the Province, situate upon the banks of a pleasant River, and in all respects convenient but for the Neigh∣bourhood of two <HI>Vulcans</HI> (as they call them at the <HI>West-Indies</HI>) that is, of certain Moun∣tains, which cast fire and smoak out of them more or less continually, and with which, a∣bout
<PB N="365" REF="192"/>
the year 1586. it was almost buried with ashes and burnt Earth, which the one of them, for the space of six moneths together, continu∣alled belched out in such fearfull quantity, that many people were slain, and the City re∣ceived much damage by it. There are many of these <HI>Vulcans</HI> in severall parts of <HI>America,</HI> as namely at <HI>Arequipa</HI> in the Kingdome of <HI>Peru,</HI> at <HI>Puebla de los Angeles,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Tlascalla</HI> abovesaid; a Mountain of so great height, that they are said to goe little less than thirty leagues, turning and winding, before they can reach the top of it, and others in se∣verall other places. They are generally Moun∣tains of great height, and running sharp up∣wards, but at the top containing some quan∣tity of plain and level grownd; in the midst whereof is the pit or hole, out of which a∣boundance of smoak and fiery ashes are vomi∣ted almost continually, and so deep, that they are supposed for the most part to reach to the very bottom of the Mountain. Some of these <HI>Vulcans</HI> cast forth neither fire nor smoak, yet are clearly seen to burn at the bottom with a quick fire, and which is so extremely hot, that it instantly melteth Iron, or any other Metall that is cast into it; as by experience hath been found. For some, conceiving that the matter
<PB N="366" REF="193"/>
which maintains these fires, within the bowells of the Earth so long together, can be nothing els but melted Gold, have endeavoured seve∣rall times to extract and draw it forth in cer∣tain Vessels of Iron and Brass, which they have caused to be let down into the bottom of the <HI>Vulcan</HI> or pit, by long Iron chaines made on purpose, but as we said, the extreme heat and force of the fire below, alwayes melted them, before they could be drawn up again, and by that meanes hath hitherto rendred all such at∣tempts frustrate. 2. <HI>St. Salvador</HI> fourty leagues distant from <HI>Guatimala</HI> Eastward, and seated upon the River <HI>Guacapa.</HI> 3. <HI>Acaputla,</HI> a Town of the Natives situated at the mouth of the said River, and is, as it were, the port Town to <HI>St. Salvador.</HI> 4. <HI>Trinidad,</HI> a Town of great resort, being the generall Empory and place of Traffique, for all sorts of Commodi∣ties, betwixt the people of <HI>New-Spain</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> 5. <HI>St. Michaels</HI> two or three leagues distant from the Bay <HI>Fonseca,</HI> upon the South Sea. 6. <HI>Xeres de la Frontera,</HI> in the Confines of this Province, towards the borders of <HI>Ni∣caragua.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Honduras</HI> hath on the South <HI>Guatimala</HI> abovesaid, on the West a certain Bay or Arme of the Sea, which they call <HI>Goulfo dulce,</HI> from
<PB N="367" REF="193"/>
the aboundace of fresh waters which run into it from all parts: On the North and North-east the Atlantick Ocean; and somewhat to the South-east <HI>Nicaragua.</HI> It containes in length <HI>viz.</HI> from East to West, coasting along upon the Sea, about one hundred and fifty leagues, and in breadth fourscore. The Coun∣try rich both in Corn and Pasturage, being said to be very much advantaged that way, by the constant overflowings of the Rivers, which it hath very many, about <HI>Michael-mass</HI> time, and which the people order so well, that they wa∣ter their very Gardens, and exceedingly ferti∣lize the whol Champaign, or lower parts of the ground by them. The Country is not thought to be without some good Mines both of Gold and Silver: but the Natives so little covetous of wealth, and the Spaniards, it seemes, so much busied elsewhere, that as yet no great discove∣ries have been made, save only about <HI>Gracias a Dios,</HI> and some few other places, where there are good Mines.</P>
<P>The cheif Towns of this Province are, 1. <HI>New-Valladolidt,</HI> anciently called <HI>Com∣mayagua,</HI> seated in a pleasant and fruitfull Valley upon the banks of the River <HI>Chamalu∣con,</HI> fourty leagues distant from the Sea. 2. <HI>Gra∣cias a Dios,</HI> thirty leagues distant from <HI>Valla∣dolidt▪</HI>
<PB N="368" REF="194"/>
Westward, made a Colony of Spaniards by <HI>Gabriel de Roias</HI> in the year 1530, for de∣fence of the Mines thereabouts, against some Savages that were not then reduced. 3. <HI>San Pedro,</HI> a place of great wealth and traffique, and the usuall residence of the Farmours of the Kings customes for this Province. 4. <HI>Pu∣erto de Cavallos,</HI> ten leagues distant from <HI>San Pedro,</HI> so called from the aboundance of Hor∣ses, which in a great tempest and storm at Sea, the Spaniards were forced to cast over board at this place. It is one of the most noted Ha∣vens of these parts, and naturally strong, yet so ill guarded formerly, that the English twice pillaged it, <HI>viz.</HI> in the year 1591, under Cap∣tain <HI>Newport,</HI> and in the year 1596, under Captain <HI>Shirley.</HI> What the state of it at pre∣sent is, I cannot say, only that it is a good in∣let into a rich Country. 5. <HI>St. Thomas de Castile,</HI> eighteen leagues distant from <HI>Caval∣los,</HI> another strong place, and to which, they say, the Colony of <HI>Puerto Cavallas</HI> was late∣ly transpoted. 6. <HI>Truxillo,</HI> a Town pleasant∣ly seated betwixt two Rivers at the foot of a Mountain, not far from the <HI>Cape de Hondu∣ras,</HI> which at this Town first begins to shew it self, running far out into the Sea; from whence the shore still withdrawing it self, as
<PB N="369" REF="194"/>
it were more inwards, all along the Coast of this Province, till it joyneth with <HI>Jucatan;</HI> there is made a very spacious and goodly Bay, called commonly the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> other∣wise <HI>Golfo dulce,</HI> as we said, having many good and secure stations for shipping. 7. <HI>St. George de Olancho,</HI> so called from the Valley of <HI>Olancho,</HI> in which it is seated: a rich part of the Country both in Mines and otherwise; inso∣much that the Governors of this Province and these of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> more than once fought for the possession of it in the field; and it was some time before the King of <HI>Spain</HI> could determine the Controversie be∣twixt them.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Nicaragua</HI> is a Country of this Province bordered Northward with <HI>Honduras;</HI> on the East with the Atlantick Ocean and part of <HI>Veragua;</HI> on the South with <HI>Mare del zur;</HI> and on the West with <HI>Guatimala,</HI> being called by some the new Kingdome of <HI>Leon.</HI> It hath few Rivers in it; the want whereof is supplyed by the benefit of a great Lake, in the midst of the Country, called by the Spaniards <HI>Laguna de Ni∣caragua,</HI> containing, as is supposed, above one hundred in leagues compass. It emptyes it self by the Port of <HI>St. Juan</HI> into the Atlantick or North Sea, but reacheth as far as the South or
<PB N="370" REF="195"/>
<HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> at least within a very few leagues; and from whence some Spanish Cap∣tains are said to have made a passage, though with much difficulty, into the Lake, and from thence to the North Sea. It is aboundantly well stored with good fish, but withall much haunted with <HI>Crocodiles;</HI> and the Country about it so plentifull in all things, especially Cattel, Cotten-wooll, Sugars, and all kinde of Fruits, that the Spaniards commonly call it <HI>Mahomets Paradise;</HI> the People said to be the most Hispanioliz'd of all other Americans since the Conquest, both in behaviour, apparel, manners, &amp;c. The chief Towns are 1. <HI>Leon de Nicaragua,</HI> a Bishops Sea. 2. <HI>Granada,</HI> both of them seated upon the Lake very commo∣diously, yet distant one from the other four∣teen or fifteen leagues at least. 3. <HI>Segovia,</HI> thirty leagues distant from <HI>Granada,</HI> having some veins of silver about it. 4. <HI>Jaen,</HI> a town almost at the end or mouth of the Lake, from whence, by a long Channel of about three or four leagues, it disembogues or emptieth it self into the Sea, at the Port <HI>St. Juan.</HI> 5. <HI>Rea∣leio:</HI> This is, as it were, the <HI>Chattam</HI> of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> being a place on the South-Sea, where the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath all his ships built, that are built of American timber, and inhabited
<PB N="371" REF="195"/>
by few or none but Shipwrights, Mariners, and men of that profession. 6. <HI>Nicoya,</HI> a town that giveth name to a little Territorie, which some reckon as a distinct part of this Province by it self. 7. <HI>Avarines.</HI> 8. <HI>Cartago,</HI> fourty leagues distant from <HI>Nicoya,</HI> and lying, almost in the midst of the Isthmus or Streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> equally distant both from the North and South Sea; on both which it is said likewise to have a convenient Port or Haven for ship∣ping.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Veragua</HI> is bounded on the West with that part of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> which some call <HI>Casta ricca,</HI> &amp; make a distinct Province of this Coun∣trie, being indeed a very wealthy part of it: on the East it hath the district, or Country of <HI>Panama,</HI> being otherwise washed on all sides by the Sea. It hath its name from a River of great note in this tract, by which it was first discovered. The Countrie is for the most part Mountainous, and the Soil outwardly but barren, but recompencing all defects with the aboundance of its more inward wealth. I mean in the richness of its Mines; of which it is said to afford many, and so inexhaustibly rich and good, that the Spaniards here know no end of their wealth; although, by reason of the stoutness and untamableness of the Na∣tives,

it were a long time, and they met with no small difficulties, before they could make themselves masters of the Treasure. The chief Towns they have here are, 1. <HI>La Conception,</HI> lying at the mouth of a River so named, and the seat of the Governor. 2. <HI>La Trinidad,</HI> upon the banks of the same River likewise, but more down towards <HI>Port Beleno,</HI> and about six leagues Eastward of <HI>Conception.</HI> 3. <HI>St. Foy,</HI> twelve leagues more to the South, where the Spaniards melt their gold, and cast it into Bars or Ingots. 4. <HI>Carlos,</HI> a town they have upon the Coast of <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI> 5. <HI>Philippina,</HI> another on the West of <HI>Carlos;</HI> both of these well seated upon a large and capacious Bay: before which there lyeth a fry of certain little Islands, to the number of thirty or more, which the Spaniards are said to have wholly dispeo∣pled long since, by forcing the Natives over into the Continent, to work in the Mines; as usually they did before the Emperors prohibi∣tion: but now they use Slaves or Negros, which they buy for that purpose from <HI>Guiny</HI> and other parts.</P>

<P N="1">1. THe Country of <HI>Peru,</HI> understand∣ing by it all that part of <HI>America</HI> which lyeth on the South of <HI>Darien,</HI> is gene∣rally resembled to the form of a Pyramis re∣versed; the Basis whereof, that is (as I con∣conceive) the more Southerly parts of it to∣wards <HI>Magellanica</HI> and the Streits, extend themselves largely both East and West, be∣coming more sharp and streit towards the North, and those parts by which it is joyned to <HI>Mexicana:</HI> in the whole it is suppo∣sed to contain a circuit of seventeen thou∣sand miles at least, and is watered with four of the greatest Rivers of the World, beside aboundance of lessers streams, which issuing from the <HI>Andes</HI> and other Mountains of the Countrie, doe run from all parts both into the North and South Sea, much fertilizing the Countries through which they pass. The four principall are these. 1. <HI>Orellana,</HI> otherwise called the River of <HI>Amazons.</HI> This riseth in the Province of <HI>Peru,</HI> and runneth a course of lit∣tle

less than five thousand miles, discharging it self at last into the North Sea, through a channel as some say, of threescore leagues broad, and yet with such a violent current or stream, that it is said to keep its natural colour and taste almost thirty miles in the Sea. 2. <HI>Ore∣noque,</HI> a River of the Province of <HI>Guiana,</HI> whose head or spring is not yet discovered, it is said to be Navigable a thousand miles toge∣ther by the tallest ships, and no less than two thousand by Pinnaces and smaller Vessels, and dischargeth it self likewise into the North Sea by sixteen several channels or mouths, making thereby several Islands, some whereof are said to be of good bigness, and to lye at a distance of one hundred miles or more one from the other. 3. <HI>Maragnon,</HI> a River of a yet larger course than any of the former, being, as 'tis said, no less than six thousand miles from its head, which is out of the <HI>Andes</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> to its fall, which is likewise into the North Sea; about <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> by a channel of seventy leagues in breadth. 4. <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> otherwise cal∣led <HI>Paraguay,</HI> a River of two thousand miles course, and falling, as the rest, into the North Sea, by a channel of threescore miles over, and about thirty four degrees Southward of the Line, towards <HI>Magellans Streits.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>CAstella del oro,</HI> as the Spaniards call it, or <HI>golden Castile,</HI> taketh up all the rest of the Isthmus or streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> which hath not been yet spoken of, being bounded Eastward and to the North-East with the Atlantick Ocean, and on the West with <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and some part of <HI>Veragua:</HI> Southward it hath <HI>the new Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Grana∣da.</HI> It is called sometimes <HI>Terra firma,</HI> because it was one of the first parts of firm Land which the Spaniards touched upon, after they had passed so many Islands, as seemed, for some

time, to block up and barre them from the Continent of <HI>America.</HI> It is subdivided into these inferiour Provinces or Countries, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Panama.</HI> 2. <HI>Darien.</HI> 3. <HI>Nova-Andaluzia.</HI> 4. <HI>St. Martha:</HI> And 5. the little Province <HI>De la Hacha.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Panama,</HI> commonly called the District or Circle of <HI>Panama,</HI> is bounded Eastward with the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Ʋrraba,</HI> by which it is separate from the rest of the Continent of this Southern part of <HI>America:</HI> on the West it hath <HI>Veragua,</HI> one of the Provinces of <HI>Gua∣timala;</HI> being on both the other sides washed with the Sea. It is supposed to contain in length from <HI>Cartagena</HI> and <HI>Popayan,</HI> to the confines of <HI>Veragua,</HI> about fourscore or nine∣ty leagues; in breadth not above threescore in any part: and where it is narrowest, <HI>viz.</HI> be∣twixt the City of <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> if measured by a right line, not above six or seven over from Sea to Sea. It lyeth al∣most under the Equinoctial line, but a few degrees Northward of it, and therefore somewhat hot, and by the neighbourhood of both Seas, subject to a foggy and gross Aire, in comparison of some other parts; so that it is not counted generally so healthfull a Coun∣trie, especially for strangers, and in the Sum∣mer
<PB N="377" REF="198"/>
time. The chief towns and places which the Spaniards inhabit here are, 1. <HI>St. Philip,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> from the good Haven adjoyning to it. A strong town and at present the staple of Trade betwixt <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> the Haven fortified likewise with two strong Castles: notwithstanding which, it was both surprized and well pillaged by the English, under the Command of Captain <HI>Parker,</HI> about the year 1601, and the Gover∣nour himself <HI>Pedro Melendez</HI> taken prisoner. 2. <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> so named by <HI>Didaco Ni∣quesa,</HI> a Spanish Adventurer, who being driven by distress of weather, and ready to be wrack∣ed, bad his Men here get on shore <HI>en Nombre de Dios</HI> (that is, in Gods name.) The town was very well seated for Commerce and Trade at the beginning, and enjoyed it for a good while; but the place being found something less healthfull, and otherwise obnoxious to Enemies at Sea, the Trade and chief Inhabi∣tants are since removed to <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> or <HI>St. Philip</HI> aforesaid, as to a more fortified and securer place. 3. <HI>Acla,</HI> a Town upon the same Coast, but lying South-East of <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI> 4. <HI>Nata,</HI> commonly called <HI>St. Jago de Nata,</HI> situated on the West side of this Pro∣vince, upon <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or the South Sea,
<PB N="378" REF="199"/>
about thirty leagues distance from <HI>Panama,</HI> towards the borders of <HI>Veragua.</HI> 5. <HI>Panama,</HI> the chief City of the Province, being also a Bi∣shops Sea, who is Suffragan to the Archbishop of <HI>Lima,</HI> and the ordinary residence of the Governour and Courts of Justice for these parts. It is seated likewise upon the South Sea, and so neer, that at high water, the ships are said to ride even under the walls. Through this town the wealth both of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> passeth once every yeer: from <HI>Spain</HI> by <HI>Nom∣bre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> from whence what∣soever Merchandise or other Commodities come from <HI>Spain,</HI> are transported to <HI>Panama</HI> by Land, and from thence by Sea to all the parts of <HI>Peru;</HI> and by <HI>Panama,</HI> whatsoever comes from <HI>Peru,</HI> to be sent into <HI>Spain.</HI> It hath commonly a strong Garrison of Souldi∣ers in it, and is doubtless a place otherwise well fortified, being of so great importance. Last∣ly <HI>La Crux Real,</HI> a few leagues distant from <HI>Panama,</HI> and for the most part inhabited by Negros.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Darien</HI> hath on the North the District, or Circle of <HI>Panama;</HI> on the South the new Kingdome of <HI>Granada:</HI> Eastward it is bound∣ed with the Gulf of <HI>Ʋrraba</HI> abovesaid, and some part of the River <HI>Darien,</HI> which giveth
<PB N="379" REF="199"/>
name to the Province: and to the West with the South Sea; of a more temperate Aire by farre than that of <HI>Panama,</HI> and a Soil so ad∣mirably fruitfull and lusty, that they say Me∣lons, Cucumers, and generally all other Fruits of the Garden are ripe and fit to gather with∣in twenty dayes or less, after their first sowing. The chief and indeed only Town of this tract is <HI>Darien,</HI> called anciently by the first Foun∣ders of it <HI>St. Maria Antiqua,</HI> and by others <HI>the Antique of Darien;</HI> being one of the first Towns that were built by the Spaniards on the firm Land.</P>
<P N="4">4. Eastward of <HI>Darien</HI> and the Gulf of <HI>Ʋr∣raba</HI> lyeth the Countrie of <HI>New-Andaluzia,</HI> as some call it, though that name be likewise (and perhaps more truly) attributed to the Province of <HI>Paria</HI> hereafter to be spoken of: on the East it hath the Countrie called <HI>St. Martha:</HI> on the North the main Ocean; and <HI>New-Granada</HI> towards the South. It is for the most part a Mountainous Countrie, and full of Woods, which, they say, yeeld aboundance of Rosin, Gumms, and some very good Balsams. But the Plains, by reason of much rain, to which the Countrie is subject, especially for some times of the year, of but a spewy and cold Soil. The Spaniards, at their first comming,
<PB N="380" REF="200"/>
found it a rich Country, not so much from the nature and profits of the Soil (though it be said to have some Mines in it, and those of Gold) but by reason of a certain opinion, and respect, which the Americans of these parts are generally said to have born towards this Country, insomuch that they would be brought and buryed therein from other places very remote; and according to the custome of the Country, not without good store of Gold and other Jewels, according to the quality and condition of the Person that was buried: of which the Spaniards soon gained intelligence, and in ransacking the Graves and Monuments of the Dead, are supposed to have found an infinite Mass of Treasure: But those Mines are long since exhau∣sted.</P>
<P>The places of chief impotance here are, 1. <HI>Carthagena,</HI> situate upon the North Sea in a sandy <HI>Peninsula</HI> or half Island, well built, and for the bigness of it, of good wealth and riches; as the English well found under Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> in the yeare 1585, when they took the place, and having pillaged it, carried away, beside aboundance of Treasure; no less than two hundred and fourty brass peices of Ordinance. It is counted one of the best

Havens belonging to the firme land of <HI>Ameri∣ca.</HI> 2. <HI>Tolu,</HI> by the Spaniards now called <HI>St. Jago,</HI> twelve leagues distant from <HI>Cartagena;</HI> a place memorable for the excellent Balsam w<SUP>ch</SUP> is brought from thence, &amp; commonly cal∣led the Balsam of <HI>Tolu.</HI> 3. <HI>St. Crux de Mopox,</HI> a neate Town, seated a little above the conflu∣ence of the two Rivers <HI>St. Martha</HI> and <HI>Mag∣dalene,</HI> which water this Province. 4. <HI>Baran∣ca de Nolambo,</HI> a place of great Traffique, e∣specially for all Commodities of the new Kingdome of <HI>Granada:</HI> it standeth upon the banks of the <HI>Magdelene</HI> River, and about six leagues distant from the Sea. 5. <HI>Buena Vista,</HI> otherwise called <HI>St. Sabastian de Buena Vista,</HI> a Town commodiously seated upon a rising ground not far from the Gulf of <HI>Ʋrraba</HI> or the Sound of <HI>Darien,</HI> about a league and half from the Sea: and lastly <HI>Villa de St. Maria,</HI> thirty leagues southward of <HI>Cartage∣na.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>St. Martha,</HI> so called from the cheif City of the Province, is bordered on the West with <HI>New-Andaluzia;</HI> on the East with <HI>Rio de la Hacha;</HI> on the North with the Ocean, and on the South with <HI>New-Granada.</HI> It is about threescore and ten leagues in length, and not much less in breadth; a mountainous

Country likewise for the most part, and the ground not much commended, but only for some fruits of the Ordinary growth of <HI>Spain, viz.</HI> Oranges, Limons, &amp;c. which thrive here very well. The aire upon the Coasts very hot, but more within land as extremely cold, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the Mountaines. The Country is well watered with Rivers, the chief whereof is <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> as they call it, or the great River of <HI>Magdalene,</HI> which rising in the Mountains of <HI>New-Granada,</HI> falleth down into this province, &amp; empties it self into the Sea, betwixt the Cities of <HI>St. Martha</HI> and <HI>Cartegena,</HI> though at a di∣stance of ten or twenty leagues from either, with a double stream, and such a violent course, that as <HI>Acosta</HI> testifies, it is counted not a little dangerous, to attempt the entrance of it sometimes, <HI>viz.</HI> when the Tyde and the stream are contrary. The chief Towns are, 1. <HI>St. Martha,</HI> seated upon the Sea coast, hav∣ing a safe and very convenient Haven belong∣ing to it, and well defended from the windes by the advantage of an high Mountain, lying almost right over against it. It is no great Town but rich, for the bigness: at least it was found so when Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> surprised it, in the year 1595. What it was the year fol∣lowing, when Sir <HI>Anthony Shirly</HI> called there,
<PB N="383" REF="201"/>
and in the yeare 1630, when the Dutch took it, I cannot say. 2. <HI>Tenariffe</HI> on the banks of the <HI>Magdalene,</HI> fourty leagues distant from <HI>St. Martha.</HI> 3. <HI>Villa de las Palmas,</HI> twenty leagues southward of <HI>Tenariff.</HI> 4. <HI>Ciudad de los Reyes</HI> in the Valley of <HI>Ʋpar,</HI> and upon the banks of a large River called <HI>Guataporta,</HI> which a little below this Town falleth into the <HI>Mag∣dalene.</HI> It is a Frontire place, and but ill neigh∣boured by reason of certain unreduced Sava∣ges inhabiting the Mountain <HI>Tayrone,</HI> and those other Mountains of this Province, which the Spaniards call <HI>las Sierras Nievadas,</HI> be∣cause their tops are perpetually covered with Snow. 5. <HI>New-Salamanca,</HI> in the same Val∣ley of <HI>Ʋpar,</HI> famous for its Brass Mines. 6. <HI>O∣canna</HI> and others.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Rio de la Hacha</HI> is the name of a little Province lyinging on the North-East of <HI>St. Martha,</HI> washed on all other parts with the waters of the main Ocean, or with the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Venezuela.</HI> It taketh its name from a small Town called <HI>de la Hacha,</HI> about a mile distant from the Sea, having no convenient Haven, but otherwise seated in a soile very rich and fertill, not only of all sorts of Fruits and and Plants, especially such as are brought from <HI>Spain,</HI> but likewise in many Mines of Gold,

Gemmes of great size and value, and many excellent Salt Wiches, as they call them. It is eight leagues distant from <HI>Salamanca</HI> afore∣said, and eighteen from <HI>Cape Vela</HI> the most westerly Point, or Foreland of the Bay of <HI>Ve∣nuezuela;</HI> and with the rest, had the hard hap to be surprised and pillaged by the English with Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in the year 1595. 2. <HI>Rancheria</HI> six leagues Eastward of <HI>la Hacha,</HI> inhabited cheifly by Pearl-fishers, or such as get their living for the most part by fishing for Pearle; which was wont to be good on these Coasts. 3. <HI>Tapia</HI> and some others.</P>

<P>Of New-Granada.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe new Kingdome of <HI>Granada,</HI> as 'tis commonly called, was for the most part both discovered and conquered by <HI>Gonsalvo Ximenes,</HI> about the yeare 1536, and with so good success that in less than a years space, the whole Country was quietly setled under the Spaniards government, and the Captain with his Small Company had made shift to gather together such a mass of Trea∣sure,
<PB N="385" REF="202"/>
as may seem almost incredible, <HI>viz.</HI> from the <HI>Reguli,</HI> or petty Princes of those Countries, whom he had either destroyed or made Tributary. <HI>Laet</HI> casteth up the summe thus, one hundred ninty one thousand, two hundred ninty four <HI>Pezos</HI> of absolute fine Gold, thirty seven thousand of Gold less fine, and eighteen thousand of the coursest sort of all. Of Emralds great and small eigh∣teeen hundred, besides aboundance of other rich booty. The Country is bounded on the North with <HI>Castella aurea</HI> aforesaid; on the West with <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> on the East with <HI>Venezuela;</HI> the Southern parts of it being not yet well discovered, by reason of certain huge and unpassable Mountains, which block it up wholly on that side, save only where a pas∣sage is kept open into the Province of <HI>Peru,</HI> specially so called. It containeth in length a∣bout one hundred and thirty leagues, and not much less in breadth, being for the most part a very healthfull Country, and abounding in Mines of the best sort of Metal, beside others of Brass and Iron. It is subdivided into these two Provinces, <HI>viz. Granada,</HI> specially so cal∣and 2. <HI>Popayana.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Granada,</HI> specially so called, is a Country of a very temperate and good aire, neither sub∣ject
<PB N="386" REF="203"/>
to much heat, nor to extremity of cold: the reason of this may seem to be its neerness to the Line, from which it is distant North∣ward but a very few degrees. The Country ex∣ceeding fruitfull both of Corn and Cattel, affording rich pasturage, and many great heards of Cattel, many good Mines, as well of Gold as other Metals; and in that part of it which is called <HI>Tunia,</HI> as great plenty of the fairest sort of Emralds. Some parts of it are woody; and among other sorts very good, both for Timber and Feuel. there is one which the Natives call <HI>Guaiacum,</HI> a medici∣nable wood, and of soveraign use, they say, for those that are subject to the <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> and such like Maladies. The People of the Coun∣try generally tall of stature, and of a strong constitution, but much more given to sport and pastime, than to any kinde of labor or in∣dustry. The Towns and places of cheif impor∣tance are, 1. <HI>St. Foy,</HI> commonly called <HI>St. Foy de Bagota,</HI> which was the old name of this Province, and to distinguish it from another <HI>St. Foy</HI> in the Country of <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> as was said. It is the Metropolis and Capitall City of this Province, an Arcbishops sea, and the ordinary residence of the Governor; built by <HI>Gonsalvo Ximenes</HI> a Spaniard Native of
<PB N="387" REF="203"/>
<HI>Granada</HI> in <HI>Old-Spain,</HI> upon the Lake called <HI>Guatavita,</HI> and is inhabited at this present by above six hundred Families of Spaniards. 2. <HI>St. Michael,</HI> twelve leagues Northward of <HI>St. Foy,</HI> and a well traded Town. 3. <HI>Tocayma,</HI> situate in the territory of the <HI>Panches,</HI> which are a certain barbarous People of this Country, not yet perfectly reduced, and possessing not the worst part of it. It is fifteen leagues di∣stant from <HI>St. Foy,</HI> towards the North-East, being situate on the banks of <HI>Pati,</HI> a small Ri∣ver, a little above its confluence into the <HI>Mag∣dalene.</HI> 4 <HI>Trinidad,</HI> seated on the banks of ano∣ther River, called <HI>Zarbi,</HI> in a convenient place and good Soil, and the Country about it rich∣ly abounding in Veins of Christall, Emralds, Adamants, Chalcedonies, and other Gemmes of good account. 5. <HI>Tunia,</HI> a strong Town, built very advantagiously for defence on the top of an hill, &amp; is both a Garrison and place of re∣treat against the Savages, which somtimes infest this Tract, and also well traded Empory. 6. <HI>Pampelona,</HI> 60 leagues from <HI>St. Foy</HI> to the North-east; a rich place both for Mines of gold, which it affordeth, and also for great heards of Cattel, which the Country breeds and maintains. 7. <HI>La Palma.</HI> 8. <HI>Merida,</HI> the fur∣thest Town of this Province North-eastward

<P N="3">3. <HI>Popayana,</HI> the other part of this New-Kingdome, is bordered on the West with part of <HI>Granada</HI> last spoken of; from which the River <HI>St. Martha</HI> divides it for the most part. On the North it hath <HI>Nova-Andalusia</HI> or <HI>Car∣tagena;</HI> on the West <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> and on the South <HI>Quito,</HI> or rather some unreduced Coun∣tries lying betwixt them both. It extends in length above one hundred leagues from North to South, but in breadth, <HI>viz,</HI> betwixt the River <HI>St. Martha,</HI> and the South Sea, not much above fourty or fifty. The Country is said to be a little too much subject to rain, yet not so, but that the fertility of the soil answers the industry of the Inhabitants in most parts very well. The places of chief note in it are, 1. <HI>Popayan,</HI> situate on the banks of a fair Ri∣ver, but not named, and in the midst of a Plain, in a place of great wealth, and enjoying a good aire. It is a Bishops Sea, and the ordi∣nary Residence of the Governour of the Pro∣vince. 2. <HI>Antiochia,</HI> otherwise called <HI>St. Fide.s de Antiochia,</HI> on the borders of <HI>New-Anda∣luzia,</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Kingdome of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>PEru,</HI> in the Southern part of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> was anciently a great and mighty Kingdome, as <HI>Mexico</HI> in the Northern, and fell under the power of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> much after the same manner, that the King∣dome of <HI>Mexico</HI> did, <HI>viz.</HI> through the dissen∣tions and differences among the People them∣selves: The manner and occasion briefly thus. <HI>Huayna Capac,</HI> the last <HI>Inca,</HI> or King of <HI>Peru,</HI> had, beside many others, two Sons which he chiefly loved; the one by a lawfull Wife his neer Kinswomen, called <HI>Huascar:</HI> the other by a Concubine named <HI>Atabalipa;</HI> betwixt whom, at his death, he divided his Kingdome; setling the one, <HI>viz. Atabalipa,</HI> at <HI>Quito,</HI> and making him King of all the Provinces belong∣ing to it, and which, for the most part, himself had conquered; and the other, <HI>viz. Huascar,</HI> at <HI>Cusco,</HI> making him King of <HI>Peru,</HI> and of the Provinces about it, at a distance of five hun∣dred leagues one from another, thereby lea∣ving to either of them a Dominion large enough, if reason could have satisfied ambiti∣on.
<PB N="391" REF="205"/>
But <HI>Huascar</HI> rested not long content, disdaining that a Bastard-Brother should share so much with him in his Kingdome, contrary to the more just interest of some of his other Brothers, and to the custom of the <HI>Incas</HI> his Ancestors, who alwaies ruled as Monarchs, not admitting any division of their Kingdoms. Hereupon differences and emulations arise be∣twixt the two Brothers; <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> King of <HI>Quito,</HI> is commanded to appear at <HI>Cusco,</HI> both to assist at the Funeral solemnities of <HI>Huayna Capac</HI> their Father, and to doe ho∣mage for his Kingdome; which he doth not refuse: only desireth the King his Brother not to oblige him to come so far, and through Countries so unsafe, without an attendance suitable to a King, and that might secure his journey: which pretence of his was not thought unreasonable. So he brings along with him an Army of thirty thousand men; which, through the negligence and too much security of <HI>Huascars</HI> Officers of Warre, was permitted to come so neer <HI>Cusco,</HI> that with it, after some Battels fought, he taketh prisoner <HI>Huascar</HI> himself, King of <HI>Peru,</HI> puts to death all the <HI>Incas,</HI> or Children of the Blood Royal, that he could get into his power; and in this manner, for some time, holds the Kingdom,
<PB N="392" REF="206"/>
though not without much difficulty, by reason of the hatred which the people generally bare towards him, for his cruelty towards the Roy∣all Progenie; and the opposition which divers of <HI>Huascars</HI> Captains made against him in se∣veral parts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Things being in this condition at <HI>Cusco</HI> among the Natives, the Spaniards that were at <HI>Panama,</HI> having rested there full fifteen yeers since the Conquest of <HI>Mexico,</HI> without ma∣king any further discovery upon the South Sea than the <HI>Islands of Pearls,</HI> which lye not above sixteen or seventeen leagues off from <HI>Panama,</HI> resolve, about this time, to make some further search of the Continent by Sea. The business was undertaken chiefly by one <HI>Fran∣cisco Pizarro,</HI> born at <HI>Truxillo</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> a Man of but mean parentage and fortune, but yet a good Souldier, and <HI>Diego Almagro,</HI> a rich Merchant of <HI>Panama.</HI> At first they met with many difficulties and discouragements in the Design; <HI>Pizarro</HI> being full eight moneths at Sea, sailing of that course, which now, having better knowledge of the Countrie, they easily dispatch in fourteen or fifteen dayes, his men some of them dying, and others deserting the service, though with the apparent hazzard of their lives: so that at eight moneths end he

found himself only with fourteen Men in a poor Island, and in the most destitute conditi∣on that could be. Yet being himself of an un∣daunted courage and resolution, and those few men he had with him of the same minde with himself, they all resolved rather to dye than to give over the Design. So putting again to Sea, they fall at last into the River of <HI>Tum∣bez,</HI> which in a few dayes brings them to a town and fortified place called likewise <HI>Tum∣bez</HI> where they found Inhabitants and a place most agreeable to their desires, <HI>viz.</HI> where they found good plenty of Gold; for which, not being in a condition to fight, they were content at present to seem Merchants; and so for a few petty Commodities which they had brought with them, of no value, 'tis said they received of the Natives the full quantity of thirty thousand <HI>pezos</HI> of pure gold; which re∣vived their spirits not a little. Whereupon finding the Countrie to be good and likely to afford much Treasure, they return back again to <HI>Panama,</HI> make declaration of the Coun∣trie they had discovered, and sollicite for fur∣ther license to subdue and conquer it. Which having obtained, <HI>Pizarro,</HI> with four other of his Brothers, stout and resolute men like him∣self, a competent number of ships, and about
<PB N="394" REF="207"/>
two hundred Souldiers, prosecute the Design, and appear at <HI>Cusco</HI> with their little Army, just at the time that the differences there were hot∣test, and that <HI>Huascar</HI> the King was newly become prisoner to his Brother <HI>Atabalipa:</HI> who, although at first he seemed to contemn the small numbers of the Spaniards, and count them little better than mad-men, that would venture so farre into a strange Countrie, no better provided than he took them to be, and upon such an extravagant pretence, as that seemed to him, which they told him was the cause of their coming; yet after a while, ha∣ving heard the noise of their Ordinance, and a little tasted how sharp their Swords were, he was content to become prisoner himself. The Spaniards at first treated him well, and put him in such hopes of liberty, that out of con∣fidence to gain it, and that he might enjoy the Kingdome, though tributary to the Spaniards, himself alone, he caused his Brother the King <HI>Huascar</HI> to be put secretly to death, and dis∣sembled the matter to the Spaniards, as if it had been done against his will; which, they in∣tending other matters, did not much examine. To obtain his liberty, he offered the Spaniards to give them the room wherein they were, filled up with gold and silver as high as a Souldier
<PB N="395" REF="207"/>
could reach with the point of his sword; and, as some say, performed it, at least the greater part of it: Yet were the Spaniards so farre from granting him liberty, according to his expectation and their promise, that not long after they took away his life, most basely strangling him in prison, after they had received him, as 'tis credibly reported, above ten milli∣ons of gold and silver together: upon preten∣ces indeed of Treason, and some dangerous plottings against them, by <HI>Atabalipa</HI> and his People; (a criminal piece of Treason doubt∣less, for a poor Prince, injuriously imprisoned, to endeavour his liberty, and his subjects to assist him the best they could!) Notwithstand∣ing which, the Spanish Writers themselves doe generally dislike the Fact, and some of them with detestation enough. <HI>God, the righteous Judge,</HI> (saith mine Author <HI>Lopez Vaz) seeing this villanous Act, suffered none of those Spani∣ards to dye by the course of nature, but brought them all to evil and shamefull ends.</HI> Which was very true: for although upon the death of <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> the Spaniards held themselves for Masters of the Countrie, and <HI>Pizarro</HI> quickly obtained of the Emperor to be made a Mar∣quess; yet long it was before the Indians could be wholly subdued, <HI>Mango Inga,</HI> the
<PB N="396" REF="208"/>
Brother of <HI>Atabalipa</HI> making a stout and sharp resistance for a good while together, defeating the Spaniards in three or four several encoun∣ters (in which <HI>Diego</HI> and <HI>John Pizarro</HI> bro∣thers to the Marquess were slain) and twice taking the Citie of <HI>Cusco</HI> from them by force. And when at last he happened to be overcome, and driven to fly to the Mountains, the Con∣querors, <HI>viz. Almagro</HI> and <HI>Pizarro,</HI> to whom the Emperor had given the command of the Countrie in several, fall out among themselves, chiefly about the bounds of their respective Dominions, Civil Warres ensue betwixt them: in which first of all <HI>Almagro</HI> is taken prisoner by <HI>Pizarro,</HI> sentenced to death, and executed without mercy; and not long after <HI>Pizarro</HI> himself murdered in his own house, by a Ba∣stard sonne of <HI>Almagro</HI> named <HI>Diego;</HI> who thereupon had the confidence to take upon him the government, and to encounter the Licentiate <HI>Vacca de Castro,</HI> the Emperors Commissioner, in the open field; where being worsted and taken, he afterward lost his head at <HI>Cusco.</HI> After this, <HI>Blascus Nunnez Vela</HI> being made Vice-Roy of <HI>Peru,</HI> and governing somewhat severely, <HI>Gonzales Pizarro</HI> the fourth Brother, rebelleth, with many Spani∣ards with him; against whom <HI>Vela Nunnez,</HI>
<PB N="397" REF="208"/>
the Vice-Roy's Brother, is sent; but to little purpose, being taken prisoner by the Pizarrists, and put to death. This so incenseth the Vice-Roy, that himself in person marcheth against the Rebells, but to his own ruine. For a Bat∣tle being fought in the fields of <HI>Quito,</HI> the hated Vice-Roy had the ill hap to be made prisoner, and by <HI>Carvaial,</HI> Lieutenant to <HI>Pi∣zarro,</HI> presently, without further process, caused to dye, in revenge, as 'tis supposed, for his bro∣ther, whom the Vice-Roy, among many o∣thers, had lately sentenced to death. <HI>Pizarro</HI> after this defeats <HI>Centenus,</HI> another General of the Emperors; but was at last, by the Go∣vernor <HI>Gasca,</HI> defeated himself, taken prisoner, and beheaded for his Rebellion, together with <HI>Carvaial</HI> his Lieutenant, and divers other of his Complices: so that there remained now of all the five Brothers <HI>Pizarri,</HI> only <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI> alive, who, as some report, was sent pri∣soner into <HI>Spain,</HI> by the Emperours Com∣missioner; others say, that his Brother the Marquess sent him thither with the process concerning <HI>Almagro's</HI> death. However, cer∣tain it is, that in <HI>Spain</HI> he dyed a prisoner. <HI>Martin de Alcantara,</HI> half-brother to the Marquess, was murdered with him in the Mar∣quess's house; <HI>Garcia Alvarado</HI> was stab'd to
<PB N="398" REF="209"/>
death by one of the Almagrists; and what became of <HI>Pedro Baldivia,</HI> with some others, shall be shewed in the description of <HI>Chile.</HI> Thus perished, by the just hand of God, and through their own mutual dissentions, ambi∣tion, and covetousness, those first Coquerors of <HI>Peru, viz. Pizarro</HI> and his Companions; none of them all leaving so much as a good name behind him: and of their issue little is spoken. The Marquiss himself is said to have had a sonne by a sister of <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> whom they call <HI>Donna Angelina,</HI> but he dyed young; and whether he were legitimate or no, it may be doubted. But the Factions of the Pizar∣rists and Almagrists being extinct, by the dili∣gence and moderation of succeeding Gover∣nours, the affairs of <HI>Peru</HI> came by degrees to be better setled, &amp; the People, either willingly, or by constraint, were perswaded to acknow∣ledge the Spanish Government, and to live quietly in most parts of the Coun∣trie.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Dominion of the Kings of <HI>Cusco,</HI> which in some sense, and by some writers up∣on occasion, is called the Kingdome of <HI>Peru,</HI> was extended by the last <HI>Inca,</HI> or King, <HI>Huay∣na Capac,</HI> from North to South above one thousand leagues together, comprehending
<PB N="399" REF="209"/>
not only a great part of the Province of <HI>Chile</HI> towards the South, but also the New-Kingdome of <HI>Granada</HI> and divers other Pro∣vinces to the North: but <HI>Peru</HI> properly so cal∣led, containeth little more than half so much, <HI>viz.</HI> six hundred leagues in length, and about fifty or threescore in breadth; except only in some places, as in the Country of <HI>Chac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poyas,</HI> where 'tis thought, it may be one hundred leagues over from the <HI>Andes</HI> to the South Sea. It is bounded on the East and North-east with that vast ridge of Mountains which they call the <HI>Andes:</HI> on the West it is washed with <HI>Marc del zur;</HI> on the North it hath the Country of <HI>Popayan;</HI> and on the South <HI>Chile.</HI> It is com∣monly divided into three parts, which they call <HI>the Plains, the Hill-country,</HI> and <HI>the Andes.</HI> The <HI>Plains</HI> are that part of the Country which lie along upon the Sea Coast, being for the most part a meer level without any Hills at all. The <HI>Sierra,</HI> as they call it, or <HI>Hill-Country</HI> is that part of <HI>Peru,</HI> which is partly mountainous and partly plain, fertill and well inhabited in both. The <HI>Andes</HI> are so high, rocky, and inac∣cessible, that they are scarce inhabited at all but by Savages, save only upon the skirts of them. The <HI>Plaines</HI> from the Sea shore to the <HI>Hill-Counsry,</HI> are for the most part about ten
<PB N="400" REF="210"/>
leagues over or broad, upon which it never raineth all the year long. The <HI>Hill-Country</HI> is commonly twenty leagues in breadth where narrowest; and from <HI>September</HI> to <HI>Aprill</HI> hath rain, the rest of the year generally being fair weather. But on the <HI>Andes,</HI> which take up all the rest of the Country of <HI>Peru,</HI> it raineth almost continually all the yeare long. In the <HI>Hill-Country,</HI> Their Summer begins in <HI>Aprill,</HI> as is said, and ends in <HI>September;</HI> but in the <HI>Plaines,</HI> it begins in <HI>October</HI> and ends in <HI>May.</HI> So that in the space of one day a man may tast both Summer and Winter; be scorchd with excessive heate in the morning, and yet well nipt with cold before night. The <HI>Andes</HI> generally are covered with thick Woods and wild Forests; the <HI>Hill-Country</HI> for a great part naked and open; the <HI>Plains</HI> in many places sandy and dry, and would be much more scorched with heat, then they are, but for the neighbourhood of the Sea, which affords them many cooling gales from the South and South-west windes; whose property, although it be naturally in other parts to be tempestuous, to bring rain and foul weather, yet here there is nothing but Serenity and fair Sun-shine dayes all the year long, although these windes blow almost without ceasing upon the Country,

and no other at any time, whereas the <HI>Sierra</HI> or Hill countrys have winde from every coast, and such as bringeth all sorts of weather with it, Rain, Hail, Frost, Snow, great claps of Thunder, &amp;c. The Countrie affordeth not so much Cattel of the breed of <HI>Europe</HI> as some other Provinces of <HI>America;</HI> but instead of these, both the Woods and Pastures are re∣plenished, with great multitudes of the <HI>Vicug∣nes</HI> and <HI>Pacos</HI> above mentioned, which are of no less profit &amp; service. The <HI>Pacos</HI> here are said to be as big as some young Heifer of two yeers old, bearing a fleece like Sheep, and their flesh no less pleasant than the Mutton of <HI>Europe.</HI> But the great wealth of this Countrie lyes out of sight, in the bowels of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> in those rich and, as they may seem, inexhau∣stible Mines both of gold and silver, which, as 'tis well known, this Countrie of <HI>Peru</HI> afford∣eth, more than any other Province of <HI>America</HI> beside. The People are said to be, at least ex∣teriorly, of greater simplicity than some other Americans, both in point of behavior and judgement, yet of good courage in the warrs and fearless of death: They are noted also to be dissemblers, and not alwaies to declare their mindes truly and plainly; and which is worse than all, to have bin given over to that foul sin

For both which (their unnatu∣ral filthiness and inhumaninity) if it pleased the Divine Justice to deliver them into the hands of those who used them likewise cruelly, who can deny but that the Judgements of God were just, and that they received <HI>such recom∣pence</HI> for their works, as the Apostle saith <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.13. <HI>was meet?</HI></P>
<P>The Countrie is generally divided into <HI>three Juridicall Resorts,</HI> as they call them, or Courts of Appeal, which are <HI>Quito, Lima,</HI> and <HI>Charcas:</HI> but the particular Provinces, as they are com∣monly observed by Geographers, said to be six, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Quito.</HI> 2. <HI>Los Quixos.</HI> 3. <HI>Lima.</HI> 4. <HI>Cusco.</HI> 5. <HI>Charcas.:</HI> And 6. <HI>Collao.</HI></P>

Much Tobacco, <HI>Guaia∣cum, Sarzaparilla,</HI> and other medicinall Plants. The chief Towns are, 1. <HI>Caranguez,</HI> anciently a Royall Citie, where stood a sumptuous and stately Palace of the Kings of <HI>Peru,</HI> now almost deserted. 2. <HI>Ottavallu,</HI> another place of the same dignitie, and the same condition at present with <HI>Carangues.</HI> 3. <HI>Quito,</HI> com∣monly called <HI>S.

It is inhabited by five hundred Families of Spaniards at least, beside Natives and well for∣tified and might be thought a town very well seated in all respects, but for the neighbour∣hood of a Vulcan, which at times annoyeth it very much; as namely in the year 1560, when it vomited out such aboundance of fla∣ming cinders and other sulphurous matter, as had it not been for a showre of rain unex∣pectedly falling, would have much damnified, if not destroyed, the place. 4. <HI>Tacunga</HI> fif∣teen

The pla∣ces most observable and important in it are, 1. <HI>Miraflores,</HI> as the Spaniards call it, a well seated and wealthy Town in the Valley of <HI>Za∣nu,</HI> five leagues distant from the Sea, where it hath likewise a good Haven or Port. 2. <HI>Truxillo,</HI> two or three leagues distant from the Sea, the Haven whereof is said to be large but not so safe.

Citie for Authority and Dignity, so is it like∣wise the chiefest for delight and wealth. 6. <HI>Cul∣lao,</HI> this is the Haven or Port Town to <HI>Lima,</HI> and but two leagues distant from it: A Town of six or seven hundred Families, all or most of them Sea-men; and not a house in it but is well provided of Cellar-room and Stowage for Merchandise, which is there received from all parts, both coming from and going to the Sea. It was, with <HI>Lima</HI> it self, surprized by Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> in the year 1579, and their Cellars searched as well as could be done in so short a time: whereupon, since it is said to be fortified with two strong Bulwarks, a wall of earth, and about thirty piece of Ordinance planted on the Works. 7 <HI>Pachacama,</HI> four leagues Southward of <HI>Lima,</HI> memorable chief∣ly for <HI>Pizarros</HI> good fortune here, who is re∣ported to have found in one only old Temple of the Natives, the quantity of nine hundred thousand Duckets of gold and silver, beside what his Souldiers are supposed to have seiz'd on and conveighed away before he came. 8. <HI>Guarco,</HI> a Colony of three hundred Spa∣niards, sixteen leagues to the Southward of <HI>Pachacama,</HI> rounded with the best fields for Wheat in all <HI>Peru.</HI> 9. <HI>Valverde,</HI> a great Town inhabited by five hundred Spaniards,

The Woods especially stored with the <HI>Coca,</HI> whose leafe is counted so restorative as we said Chap. 7. and with much excellent Venison.

The <HI>Incas</HI> Pa∣lace here was justly counted one of the won∣ders of the World: it was built on the top of a very high Mountain, on the North side of the Citie, walled round about, and for the most part of it, with three several walls all of massy stones, and those of such huge stupendious bigness, yet most exactly laid together and fitted one with another, that the Spaniards, considering the Indians had neither Instru∣ments of Iron, or any thing else to polish and fashion them, nor Engins to draw them up to that height, nor so much as Carts to fetch them from the Quarries and places where they were found, which was eight or nine leagues di∣stance, and over no small Rivers, said plainly, 'twas the work of the Devil, and not of Man, to lay them there: which seeming a thing not so easily to be supposed, I must, for my part, as plainly confess, 'tis a Problem somewhat above my capacity at present to resolve, <HI>viz.</HI> how it should come to pass, that not only here, but in divers other parts of the Countrie, where the <HI>Incas</HI> and their Nobility had their Palaces, such evident Monuments of ab∣solute Art and Skill should be found among a People so absolutely ignorant
<PB N="413" REF="216"/>
and unacquainted with Art, as the Ame∣ricans were reported to be. It is now quite demolished, and converted to private dwellings; only the walls are permitted to stand, as well to testifie the greatness of the ancient structure, as because the stones thereof (as mine Author <HI>Laet</HI> reporteth) are so hugely ponderous &amp; big, that the Spainards know not well how to remove them, and per∣haps dare not venture upon it. Many other Monuments there were of the <HI>Incas</HI> Magnifi∣cence &amp; greatnes, as beside their Temples which were very stately and rich. Those publick Caw∣seys or high-wayes, pav'd and laid with stone, which the <HI>Incas,</HI> with incredible cost and pains had caused to be made from <HI>Cusco</HI> to the ut∣most Confines of their Kingdome, as large as it was, onely for the ease and commoditie of the people; they all meeting at <HI>Cusco</HI> from all quarters, l ke so many lines from severall parts of the Circumference, and Concentring in the midst of the City, upon a <HI>Piazza</HI> or Market-place, one of the fairest in all <HI>Peru.</HI> The wealth which the Spaniards found here is not to be estimated; all the Vessels, and U∣tensills, of what sort soever, belonging to the <HI>Incas</HI> Palace, being said to be of perfect Silver or Gold; all the Roomes and Cham∣bers
<PB N="414" REF="217"/>
of the Palace wainscoted and ceiled with Gold; beside an infinite number of Birds, Beasts, Fowles, Serpents and other creatures, carved and wrought all of Gold or Silver. Nor was it otherwise in due proportion, in the Palaces of the Nobility: all were found inesti∣mably wealthy and rich: And yet 'tis thought, what they found above ground, was nothing, in comparison of that which they met with in the ransacking of Cellars, Vaults, and other subterraneous places, where the poor con∣quered Peruvians had endeavoured to con∣vey it out of sight; which was such that to this day, they say, those treasures are not ex∣hausted, but that in digging upon occasion un∣der ground, they still chop upon some good quantities of concealed Metals. The City at present is thought to contain some thirteen or fourteten thousand Inhabitants, whereof the third part only Spaniards, the rest Natives. 7. <HI>St. Francisco de la vittoria,</HI> a Colony of Spaniards situate at the foot of the <HI>Andes,</HI> twenty leagues distant from <HI>Cusco.</HI> 8. <HI>St. Juan del oro,</HI> another Colony in the Valley of <HI>Caravaya,</HI> neighboured with rich Mines of the purest Gold of <HI>Peru.</HI> Beyond which pla∣ces, more towards the <HI>Andes,</HI> there are said to lie certain Countries as yet undiscovered,

much famed for gold Mines, but of such un∣passable difficulty, that hitherto the Spaniards, though divers times attempting it, have not been able to effect any thing answerable to their desires.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Collao</HI> lyeth Southward of those Coun∣tries, which goe under the generall name of the Province of <HI>Cusco,</HI> having on the West <HI>Lima,</HI> on the South <HI>Charcas;</HI> but Eastward and to the North-east, it is shut up by a ridge of Mountaines, running in one body or con∣tinued Tract from the confines of <HI>Collao,</HI> as far as the City of <HI>Cusco,</HI> where they divide. The Country generally plain, commodiously watered in all parts with fresh Rivers, and consequently affording rich pasturage and good heards of Cattell. It is thought to be the most populous Country of all <HI>Peru;</HI> what through the soundness and good temperature of the aire, what through the richness and fer∣tility of the Soil. The chief Towns and places of note in it, being 1. <HI>Chuquinga,</HI> a great Town, and held to be naturally almost im∣pregnable, as being environed round about, either with deep unfordable Waters, or with Mountains unpassable, and having one only Cawsey leading to it, reported to be for two or three leagues together no broader than to

permit one single person to march convenienly upon it. 2. <HI>Ayavire,</HI> by the Spaniards called <HI>Las Sepulturas,</HI> being a place especially eno∣bled by the stately Monuments of the Peru∣vian Nobility, which were found there. 3. <HI>Hatuncolla,</HI> the Metropolis or chief Town of this Province, seated upon the banks of the River <HI>Caravaya,</HI> whose sands are very much fam'd for Gold. 4. <HI>Chinquita,</HI> a Colony of Spaniards upon the banks of <HI>Titicaca,</HI> one of the greatest Lakes that belong to <HI>America</HI> said to be fourscore leagues in compass, having many small Islands in it of a good and fruitfull soil, abounding in fish and variety of Sea-fowl. It is supposed to be fourscore leagues distant likewise from the South Sea, having only one Estuary or Mouth, which is something streit, but of such a deep water and violent stream, that, as <HI>Acosta</HI> testifieth of it, it is not possible to build a Bridge of stone, or timber over it. But the Natives instead thereof have laid a Bridge of straw upon it, which serves as well; <HI>viz.</HI> so many great bundles of straw sedge or such like matter, well and surely made up, and fastened together, as will reach from one side or bank of the Estuary to another; at which likewise having made them sure, they cast some good quantity of more straw and
<PB N="417" REF="218"/>
sedge upon them, and have a Bridge very con∣venient, upon which they doe both securely pass themselves, and also drive Cattell and doe other necessary business. The Town is a place of extraordinary Wealth and Trading, and so considerable, that the Governour thereof is always named by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> himself, and his place estimated at fifty thou∣sand Duckats <HI>per annum.</HI> 5. <HI>Tiaguanaco</HI> at the Estuary or Mouth of the Lake, memorable only for the ruines of certain great and stupen∣dious buildings, which anciently, it seems, have stood there, the stones whereof (some of them) are said to have been of thirty foot length a piece, fifteen foot broad, and six or seven foot thick. There were likewise found the Statues of certain men excellently carved and wrought, of a Gigantine Stature or bigness, and likewise vested in forrain and strange ha∣bits, not at all used, nor ever known to have been used by the Peruvians themselves, or by any other of the present Nations of <HI>America.</HI> 6. <HI>Nuestra Sennora de la Paz,</HI> or <HI>our Lady of Peace.</HI> It is but a small Town, yet pleasantly seated upon the banks of a River in a fair and fruitfull Plain, having Mountaines on either side.

<P N="7">7. <HI>Los Charcas</HI> is the furthest Country Southward of the Province of <HI>Peru,</HI> reaching up as far as <HI>Ch le,</HI> with which on the South it is bordered, having on the North <HI>Lima</HI> and <HI>Col∣lao;</HI> on the West <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and on the East some Countries not yet well discovered, which lie betwixt it and the Province of <HI>Para∣guay,</HI> or <HI>de la Plata.</HI> The Country is said to be in length about one hundred and fifty leagues, measuring it directly, or in a right line from North to South; but measuring it about a∣long the Sea Coast much above two hundred. Not very rich either in Corn or Cattel, al∣though in some parts it wanteth not good Pasturage: but of unparalleld wealth, in respect of the Mines both of Gold, and Silver which are here digged; the principall whereof are those of <HI>Potozi,</HI> and <HI>Porco</HI> above menti∣oned.

The Town is conveniently sea∣ted in a fruitfull soil, honoured with the Resi∣dence of the Governour of the Province, and with a Bishops Sea, said to be the richest of <HI>Peru, viz.</HI> of fourescore thousand Duckets rent <HI>per annum.</HI> 2. <HI>Oropesa,</HI> a place of good Me∣tal, as a man may it perceive by the name; lieth in the rich and pleasant Valley of <HI>Cochabamba,</HI> twenty leagues distant from <HI>la Plata.</HI> 3. <HI>Po∣tozi,</HI> before the discovery of the Mines a poor and sorry Village, now the richest and best peopled Town of the Province, inhabited by no less than four or five thousand Spaniards, and of the Natives many more, beside above thirty thousand poor Negro-Slaves and other people belonging unto and labouring in the Mines; whose dwelings are in divers little
<PB N="420" REF="220"/>
Villages thereabouts: a place hugely resorted unto, both by Merchants for profit, and by Gallants for their pleasure, and though lying in a cold and but barren soil outwardly, yet so well accomodated with all things, that no∣thing can be desired more: and we need not wonder it should be so; for where money is, there is alwayes the best Market. The place lyeth in one and twenty degrees and some Mi∣nutes of Southern latitude, eighteen leagues distant from <HI>La Plata,</HI> and about one hundred and sixty from <HI>Cusco;</HI> and may be found both from the North and South Sea. From the South by the way of <HI>Arica,</HI> which is a Port or Haven upon <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> seventy leagues or thereabouts distant from it, whither all, or most part of the Silver of <HI>Potozi, Porco,</HI> and other Mines of this province, is carryed year∣ly upon the backs of the <HI>Pacos,</HI> or Sheep of <HI>Peru</HI> above mentioned, to be shipped there, for <HI>Panama,</HI> or <HI>Lima,</HI> and so for <HI>Spain.</HI> From the North it may be found by the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> which falleth into the Atlantick Ocean thirty four degrees and some minuts Southward of the Line, and hath many good Townes of Spaniards seated either upon, or neer unto it, as namely <HI>Buenos Ayres, St. Fe, Corduba, St. Jago de Eteco,</HI> and others, by
<PB N="421" REF="220"/>
which through a plain, and for the most part plentifull Country, the March to <HI>Potozi</HI> is so fair and open, that it may seem rather tedious than difficult. For they lay it indeed com∣monly at a distance of three hundred leagues or more from <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> which is the far∣thest Town from it toward the Sea; but per∣haps upon tryall, it would not be found so much; it being otherwise certainly reported, that the Spaniards of <HI>Petozi</HI> and parts there∣abouts, doe frequently come down and trade with those of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> for divers sorts of European Merchandise, and others, and would do much more, if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would give leave, which if the distance were so great betwixt them, perhaps were not so pro∣bable. 4. <HI>Misque.</HI> 5. <HI>Lagunilla.</HI> 6. <HI>Tarixa,</HI> smaller Towns, but such as furnish <HI>Potozi</HI> with all sorts of good Wine, Wheate, <HI>Maiz,</HI> Sugar and the choisest fruits. 8. <HI>Arica</HI> the most known and frequented Port of this Country, upon <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> of which we spake in the discription of <HI>Potozi.</HI> It was taken and sacked by Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> in the year 1577, who found good booty both in the Town and in the ships; but is since, they say, better fortified both with Bul∣warks and Ordinance, as doubtless the

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Province of <HI>Chile.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. FOllowing the coast of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or the South Sea, the next Province pertaining formerly to the Kingdome of <HI>Peru,</HI> is that of <HI>Chile.</HI> This is the most Southerly Province of the whole Country of <HI>America,</HI> reaching up as far as <HI>Magallanes</HI> Streits, with which to the Southward it is bounded: North∣ward it hath a Desart, and undiscovered Country, lying betwixt it and the confines of <HI>Peru</HI> called <HI>Atacama:</HI> on the West it hath <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and on the East up to <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> the Atlantick or North Sea, with some Countries undiscovered, which inter∣pose betwixt it and <HI>Paraguay</HI> to the North-East. It lyeth all of it beyond the Tropique of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> in a temperate Zone, and extendeth it self in length from the borders of <HI>Peru,</HI> to the mouth of the Streits five hundred leagues or more; but the breadth of it neither equall nor certain. They say 'tis called <HI>Chile</HI> from the word <HI>Chil,</HI> which signifies <HI>cold;</HI> it seems
<PB N="423" REF="221"/>
in their language as well as ours, it being ge∣nerally a cold and bleak Country, the aire in many parts of it so extremely sharp and pier∣cing, that both Horse and Rider sometimes in travelling are frozen to death, as the Spani∣ards found by experience in their first search and discovery of the Country, under the Con∣duct of <HI>Diego Almagro,</HI> who is said to have left the greatest part of his men dead behinde him in this manner. But this is chiefly towards the <HI>Andes,</HI> and on the Sea coast; the more inland parts of it, though mountainous also in some parts, yet are more temperate, and being also well watered with Rivers, are much more fruitfull than the other, affording both Wheat, and <HI>Maiz,</HI> and likewise other grain, excel∣lent Pasturage in many places and great store of Cattel, Wine, Honey, not without many &amp; rich Mines both of Gold and Silver. The Na∣tives of this Country were found the most stout and warlike of all the Americans, the Spaniards had hitherto met withall, fighting with them and oftentimes defeating them in the open field surprising and sacking their Towns, and last of all taking their Captain and Commander in chief Prisoner. This was <HI>Pedro Baldivia,</HI> one of those good men that consented to the death of <HI>Atabalipa</HI> the last
<PB N="424" REF="222"/>
King of <HI>Peru,</HI> after a greater ransome ac∣cepted and paid, than perhaps the King of <HI>Spain</HI> could well raise on a sudden, if he had occasion to use it for himself. The <HI>Araucans</HI> (for so are the People called that had him pri∣soner) are said to have entertained him for a while gallantly, making him a feast; but for his last draught give him a cup of melted gold, which the poor man was forced to take down, and so dyed.</P>
<P>The whole Province generally is divided first into <HI>Chile,</HI> specially so called; and second∣ly <HI>Magellanica,</HI> or that part which lyeth more Southward down to the Streits of <HI>Ma∣gellan.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Chile,</HI> properly so called, is bordered Northward with the Desart and barren Countrie of <HI>Atacama</HI> above mentioned; on the South with <HI>Magellanica;</HI> on the West with <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> Eastward and to the North-East with some parts of <HI>Pa∣raguay,</HI> or rather with some undisco∣vered Countries, lying betwixt them both. The length of it from North to South is recko∣ned to be little less than three hundred leagues, and generally of a fruitfull Soile, affording beside aboundance of gold and silver, both Corn, Cattel, Vineyards, and divers sorts of
<PB N="425" REF="222"/>
Fruits, equall both for kinde and plenty to <HI>Spain</HI> it self, and sundry other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Aire likewise for the most part temperate, and the People, in their manners and conditi∣ons approaching much neerer to the Civility and likewise subtilty of Europeans, than other Americans did: which doubtless may be at∣tributed to the conformity of the Climates under which they lye, agreeable to those of <HI>Europe;</HI> though otherwise in respect of the sphere and seasons of the yeer, there be Diame∣tricall difference betwixt us, as for example, their Spring beginning in <HI>September,</HI> which is our Autumn; and their Autumn in <HI>March,</HI> which is our Spring: their longest day being that of <HI>St. Lucy</HI> on the eleventh of <HI>December,</HI> which is our shortest; and their shortest be∣ing <HI>St. Barnabies, viz.</HI> the eleventh of <HI>June</HI> which is our longest, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Towns of chiefest note and impor∣tance in this Province are first <HI>Gopiapo,</HI> an old Town in the most Northerly parts of this Pro∣vince, towards the Sea, where it hath a very commodious Haven belonging to it. 2. <HI>La Serena,</HI> a Town situate on the banks of <HI>Co∣quimbo,</HI> a pleasant River a little above its in∣flux into the Sea, built by <HI>Baldivia,</HI> in the year 1544: The Countrie about it very rich in
<PB N="426" REF="223"/>
Mines of Gold; and the Town it self so well garrison'd for fear of the Natives, that when the English, under Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> about four-score years since, attempted the gaining of the place, they found hot service of it, being stoutly resisted and beaten back again to their ships, by a salley of no less than three hundred good Horse and two hundred Foot. 3. <HI>St. Ja∣go,</HI> the principall Town of the Province, a Bi∣shops Sea, and the ordinary residence of the Governor, lying on the banks of the River <HI>Tapocalma,</HI> in the thirty fourth degree of Southern latitude, fifteen leagues distant from the South-Sea, at which it hath a very com∣modious and much frequented Haven, which they call <HI>Valparayso,</HI> and where the English met with better fortune, as hath been said al∣ready in the report of Sir <HI>Francis Drakes</HI> voy∣age. 4. <HI>La Conception,</HI> a strong Town, seated on the Bay called <HI>Penco,</HI> threescore or seventy leagues distant from <HI>St. Jago</HI> towards the South, a place not a little fortified both by Nature and Art, having the Bay and a certain ridge of high Mountains begirting it almost round about; and where it is otherwise ac∣cessible, a Castle and certain Bulwarks with Ordinance, besides a Garrison of five hundred Souldiers at least continually in it: and all
<PB N="427" REF="223"/>
little enough to defend it against the <HI>Arau∣canes,</HI> their deadly Enemies, who live therea∣bouts, and are ever and anon making incursions almost up to the walls of it. Over against the place, in <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> but very neer the shore, there lyeth a certain Island called <HI>St. Maries,</HI> exceedingly plentifull in Swine and all sorts of Poultry, which the Garrison of <HI>La Conception</HI> make good use of. 5. <HI>Los Confines:</HI> this is a Frontier Town, built by the aforesaid <HI>Baldivia,</HI> for defence of the rich Mines of gold at <HI>Ongol,</HI> a place neer adjoyn∣ing. 6. <HI>La Imperiale,</HI> another strong Garri∣son of this place on the banks of the River <HI>Cauten,</HI> neer to which that great battel was fought, where <HI>Baldivia,</HI> with divers other Spaniards, was taken prisoner, who were no otherwise overcome, but by being overwearied with killing of their Enemies, and by that means not able to make their retreat. 7. <HI>Villa rica,</HI> another Colonie of the Spaniards in these parts, sixteen leagues distant from <HI>Imperiale,</HI> and twenty five from the Sea. 8. <HI>Baldivia,</HI> so named from the Commander himself <HI>Pedro Baldivia,</HI> who built it in the Valley of <HI>Gua∣dallanquen,</HI> two or three leagues distant from the Sea, where it hath a good and capacious Port; but neerer to it the best Mines of <HI>Peru,</HI>
<PB N="428" REF="224"/>
so rich, that 'tis said, they yeelded <HI>Baldivia</HI> every day, so long as he could enjoy them, twenty five thousand Crowns for every man that wrought in them. 9. <HI>Osorno,</HI> a Town ly∣ing on the Bay of <HI>Chilve</HI> in a barren Soile out∣wardly, but otherwise neither less rich, nor less populous than <HI>Baldivia</HI> it self. These three towns, <HI>viz. Baldivia, Imperiale,</HI> and <HI>Osorno</HI> were in the years 1596, 1599, 1604, surprized by the <HI>Araucanes,</HI> and other sava∣ges confederate with them, sack'd and burnt; and though the Spaniards be said to have re∣covered and garrisond some of them with fresh Souldiers, yet how long they were able to hold them, or whether they be Masters of them at this day I cannot say. There is likewise 10 <HI>Castro</HI> the most Southerly Town of the whole Province; built in a certain Island within the Bay of <HI>Chilve;</HI> and lastly towards <HI>Paraguay</HI> and <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> there are the Towns <HI>Men∣doza,</HI> and <HI>St. Juan de la Frontera;</HI> but they lye on the other side of the <HI>Andes,</HI> fourty leagues distant from any of these we speak of, and perhaps more, and not above one hun∣dred from <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and the Atlantick Ocean.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Magellanica,</HI> the other part of this Pro∣vince is bounded Northward with <HI>Chile</HI> above∣said,
<PB N="429" REF="224"/>
and some parts of the Countries <HI>de la Plata;</HI> on the South with the narrow-Sea called <HI>Magellans Streits,</HI> having <HI>Mare del Zur</HI> on the West; and on the East the Atlan∣tick Ocean. It contains in length, from the borders of <HI>Chile</HI> to the mouth of the Streits, about one hundred leagues; and in breadth, <HI>viz.</HI> from the North to the South Sea, some∣what more, <HI>viz.</HI> towards <HI>Chile</HI> and the North-west parts of it; for towards the South and South-west it streightens still more and more; insomuch, that they which resemble the Southern part of <HI>America</HI> to the form of a Pyramis reversed, makes this part of the Coun∣trie to be the spire or top of the Pyramis. It beareth the name of <HI>Ferdinand Magellan,</HI> a Portughese, who first discovered that narrow Sea, so famously known by the name of <HI>Ma∣gellans Streits,</HI> upon which it lyeth. It is a large Countrie and supposed not to be altoge∣ther barren of Metals; but as yet no great discoverie hath been made of it: partly by rea∣son of the excessive cold to which 'tis thought to be subject: and partly perhaps by reason of the difficulty of the enterprize, it being so far remote, and very hardly passable in many pla∣ces, by reason of the huge mountains the <HI>An∣des,</HI> which barre it, as it were, against all ad∣venturers:
<PB N="430" REF="225"/>
but chiefly by reason of the stout∣ness and untameableness of the <HI>Araucanes</HI> and other Natives of <HI>Chile,</HI> through whose Coun∣trie the march lyeth, and who must first be conquered. So that very little can be said more of this Countrie, than only to name the Ports and places upon the Sea coasts, at which the Spaniards, and likewise some other Nati∣ons at several times have touched: the chief whereof upon the South-Sea are first <HI>Cabo de las Islas,</HI> a Promontorie or Foreland twenty six leagues distant from that of <HI>St. Felix</HI> on the confines of <HI>Chile.</HI> 2. <HI>Puerto de San. Ste∣phano,</HI> fiftie leagues from that, towards the South. 3. <HI>La Valle de Nuestra Sennora,</HI> or <HI>our Ladies Dale,</HI> a large and secure Bay, eigh∣teen leagues Southward of <HI>St. Stephens.</HI> 4. <HI>La Punta Delgada</HI> 5. <HI>Puerto de los Reyes.</HI> 6. <HI>Ancona Sin Salida:</HI> All of them South∣ward towards the Streits. Then is there al∣most at the opening of the Streits <HI>Cabo de la Vittoria, Cabo Desseado,</HI> and some others. Up∣on the North-Sea, and up towards <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> the chief places observed are first <HI>Rio de la Crux,</HI> and the Cape which they call <HI>de las Rameras,</HI> about thirty leagues distant from the Streits mouth. 2. The Bay of <HI>St. Julian,</HI> fourty leagues Northward of that. 3. <HI>El
<PB N="431" REF="225"/>
Puerto Desseado.</HI> 4. <HI>Puerto de los Leones.</HI> 5. The Bay of <HI>Anegada:</HI> All of them good and capacious Havens for the security of shipping upon these coasts, and lying at a di∣stance of thirty or fourty leagues one from another, up towards <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> and the Countrie of <HI>Paraguay,</HI> of which we are next to speak.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the Streits</HI> themselves, so much spo∣ken of, and likewise so necessary to be known by those who frequent these parts of the World, they are a narrow Sea or Frith, by which the Atlantick Ocean, or rather some parts of it, doth fall into <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or the South Sea. The passage is long, running, as 'tis commonly supposed, will nigh one hun∣dred leagues together, almost in a parallel line, or in the same degree of latitude from one end to the other: and likewise extremely difficult, by reason of the many windings and turnings of the Sea, which force them to be ever and anon altering of their course; and a Mountainous high Countrie on both sides of it, from whence it is almost continually beaten with storms, both dangerous and terrible, They were first discovered by <HI>Ferdinand Magellan,</HI> by Nation a Portughese, but in the service of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and by him named <HI>Ma∣gellanes
<PB N="432" REF="226"/>
Streits:</HI> who, although himself lived not to return into <HI>Spain,</HI> being slain in the con∣quest of the <HI>Moluccae</HI> Islands, yet his compa∣nions did, in the ship called <HI>Vittoria;</HI> from whence the Cape <HI>de la Vittoria</HI> abovesaid took its name. They lye at the mouth or entrance of them by the Atlantick Ocean, in the fifty two degrees of Southern latitude, and have not above fifty three and some minutes at their <HI>Exit,</HI> or opening into the South-Sea. There is likewise since this, and of but late times, <HI>viz.</HI> about the year 1615 another <HI>Streit</HI> discovered, by the Dutch, and called from the Discoverer <HI>Fretum,</HI> or the <HI>Streits of le Maire,</HI> four or five degrees more to the Southward than those of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and supposed to be a much ea∣sier and safer passage. The intention was, by the discovery of these <HI>Streights,</HI> to have found a shorter way to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and the Kingdoms of <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> than that which was then only used, <HI>viz.</HI> by the Cape <HI>de Buena Speranza,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Africk:</HI> and so they doe; but by reason of the great difficultie and uncertaintie of the passage, I suppose neither the one nor the other is much frequented: the Spaniards for the most part serving themselves of their American Ports upon the South-Sea, from whence they make
<PB N="433" REF="226"/>
their voyages and returns to and from the other Indies, and from thence home to <HI>Spain;</HI> and the English with other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> trading still by the Coast of <HI>Africk</HI> and Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> or else by the way of <HI>Alexan∣dria</HI> and the Persian Gulf, as heretofore.</P>

WEe have seen in <HI>Magellanica</HI> the furthest, that is, the most Southerly part of the New-World, and be∣fore it in order all the Western Coasts of <HI>America</HI> that lye either upon or towards <HI>Ma∣re del Zur, viz.</HI> from <HI>Panama,</HI> the first Pro∣vince of this Southern part down as far as the <HI>Streits.</HI> We are now to return and take a view of the Eastern Coasts, and those Countries which lye upon the Atlantick Ocean, steering our course henceforth Northward, not direct∣ly, but as the Coast leads us for a while East∣ward and by North: for as much as the Land of <HI>America</HI> from the Streits of <HI>Magellan</HI> up as far as <HI>Brasil,</HI> and almost to the Equator, runneth out with a long Easterly point, little

less than three thousand leagues together. The first Province we meet with on this side, next to <HI>Magellanica,</HI> is the Countrie of <HI>Paraguay,</HI> oftentimes called <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> from the name of an huge River, which runneth for the most part, through the midst of it. It is bor∣dered, as we said, to the South and towards the Streits with <HI>Magellanica;</HI> on the East with the Atlantick Ocean; more Northward, or to the North-East, it hath <HI>Brasil;</HI> and on the West those undiscovered Countries of the Pro∣vince of <HI>Chile,</HI> of which we spake. The Coun∣trie on both sides the River is reported to be a very lusty and fruitfull Soil, bearing besides those which are proper and Native, all sorts of European Fruits and Grain in great aboun∣dance, with Sugar-Canes, as many, great, and good, as any other Province of the New-World. Nor is it excelled by any other Coun∣trie for good pasturage and great heards of Cattel, Sheep, Swine: In particular Horses are said to have so multiplyed here, that of thirty Mares, and about six or seven Stallions, which the Spaniards left there, in the space of fourty yeers the whole Countrie thereabouts towards the South, was filled with the Breed of them, running wilde in great companies to∣gether, through all the Woods and Forrests

of the Country, and of excellent mettle and service if they could be tamed. It affordeth likewise great store of wild Deer and Stags, some Lions, Tygers, &amp;c. nor is it without good Mines, some both of Gold and Silver; but cheifly, as to what is yet discovered, of Brass, and Iron; and the People altogether Sa∣vage. The River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> which, as we said divides the Country, is one of the largest of the whole World, rising, as 'tis supposed, out of the Lake called <HI>de los Xarayes,</HI> three hundred leagues or more within land, and falling into the Atlantick, or North Sea, in thirty four degrees of Southern latitude, with an Estuary or Mouth of thirty, or two and thirty leagues over.</P>
<P>The whole Country is usually subdivi∣ded into three inferiour Provinces, which are. 1. <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> properly so called. 2. <HI>Tucuman.</HI> 3. <HI>La Crux de Sierra.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> properly so called, is that part of the Country, which extendeth it self on both sides of the River, in length ma∣ny leagues together, but not answerable in breadth; and containeth these Towns of chief∣est note and importance, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> by some called <HI>La Trinidad,</HI> on the Sou∣thern banks of the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> sixty

four leagues, they say, from the Mouth of it. It is seated commodiously at the foot of a little Mountain, and fortified with a Mud-wall, a little Castle, and some pieces of Or∣dinance. 2. <HI>Sta.

<P N="1">1. NOrthward of <HI>Paraguay,</HI> or <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> lyeth the Country of <HI>Brasil,</HI> a large Province of this Easterly part of <HI>America,</HI> and bounded to the East with <HI>Ma∣re del Nort,</HI> or the Atlantick Ocean; on the West with the <HI>Andes.</HI> On the North it hath the great River <HI>Maragnon,</HI> which divides it from <HI>Guiana,</HI> and on the South <HI>Paraguay.</HI> It containes in length measuring by the Sea coast from North to South, two hundred leagues and more, but in breadth, that is from the <HI>An∣des</HI>
<PB N="440" REF="230"/>
to the Sea, scarse half so much: of which likewise but a small portion is yet discovered, and less possessed; The Portugheses, who are Masters of the Country, holding only some few places towards the Sea, with so much of the uplands as the Inhabitants thereabouts can use, leaving all the rest to the Natives, or such as will adventure further for it. The Country is in some parts mountainous, and well set with Forests and huge Woods, yet generally of a Champaign and low ground, commodiously distinguished and watered with good Rivers. The Aire for the most part sound and healthfull, being said to be very much cleered by certain fresh windes from the Southward, which they have almost continu∣ally all along upon the coasts. The Soil would be admirably fruitfull, were it not for over∣much rain; to which, especially in some parts the Country is subject. Nevertheless it is won∣derfully plentious, and aboundeth with sugar-Canes, more than any other part of <HI>America</HI> beside; the Portugheses here having their <HI>Inge∣nios,</HI> as they call them, or sugar-Mills, up and down in all parts of the Country, with many thousands of Slaves working in them, which are brought them yearly out of <HI>Guiny, Con∣go,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Africk.</HI> And 'tis a mer∣chandise
<PB N="441" REF="230"/>
doubtless of huge profit to them; the Portugheses being supposed to transport one year with another only out of <HI>Brasil</HI> a hun∣dred and fifty thousand <HI>Arrobes</HI> of fine sugar, every <HI>Arrobe</HI> containing twenty five Bushels, as some say, of English measure. There is like∣wise great quantity of that red wood, which they commonly call <HI>Brasil</HI>-wood, so much u∣sed both in <HI>England</HI> and other parts for dying of Cloath. The Trees of this wood are said to be of such incredible bigness, that whole Fa∣milies of the Natives live upon or within an Arme of them, and they are a principall Sto∣wage and refuge for them, when the Land is overflowed with waters, as at some times of the year it happens to be, and that unexpe∣ctedly on the sudden. This Country is another <HI>Africk,</HI> abounding with variety of many strange and prodigious creatures, more than any other part of the <HI>New-World,</HI> as may be seen in Authors, especially <HI>Laet lib.</HI> 15. <HI>cap.</HI> 5. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Natives generally no less savage and barbarous, going for the most part naked, eating Mans-fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh; the men cruel to extrea∣mity, and the women as wanton and immo∣dest: both of them, especially more towards the <HI>Andes,</HI> hairy all over like bruit beasts, from whom they seem but little to differ, save only in shape.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="231"/>The Country is not as yet divided into Pro∣vinces or such nationall districts, as the other parts of <HI>America</HI> generally are, although there be found among them as many severall sorts of People, and of different languages, as in any other Country, but into certain Pre∣fectures or lesser Governments, which the Portugheses have erected and setled, only for the command and better securing of those parts which themselves hold in the Country. They lie all of them towards the Sea coast, and are reckoned to be about thirteen in number <HI>viz.</HI></P>

It lyeth two or three leagues distant from the main Ocean, and was taken and held by the English under Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Cavendish,</HI> some two moneths together, in the yeare 1521, but is now better fortified with a Wall, two strong Castles, and some pie∣ces of Ordinance. 2. <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> not above four miles distant from <HI>Los Santos,</HI> and better built, only it hath not the benefit of such a

<P>The Prefecture of <HI>Rio de Janeiro,</HI> a district of this Country once held by the French, but taken from them by the Portugheses in the yeare 1558, and all the French put to the Sword.

<P><PB N="444" REF="232"/>The Prefecture <HI>del Spirito Santo,</HI> one of the most fertil Prefectships of all <HI>Brasil,</HI> plenti∣fully stored with Cotton-wooll, watered with excellent Rivers, especially that which they call <HI>Parayba,</HI> of a large stream, and full of good fish. The Prefecture it self is not very large, as having one only Town of note in it, inhabited by the Portugheses, called likewise <HI>Spirito Santo;</HI> but it hath two hundred Fami∣lies at least in it, and a very safe and commo∣dious Haven belonging to it three or four leagues distant from the Sea.</P>
<P>The Prefecture of <HI>Puerto Seguro,</HI> fifty leagues more to the North of <HI>Spirito Santo,</HI> having these Towms, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Puerto Seguro</HI> it self, seated, as it were, upon a Rock or Cliff to∣wards the Sea side, where it commands the Haven, and contains in it about two hundred Families of Portugheses. 2. <HI>Sta.

to threaten no less to themselves.</P>
<P>The Prefecture <HI>Dos Ilheos,</HI> as the Portughe∣ses call it, either from certain Islands which lye before it, or from the principall Town cal∣led <HI>Ilheos</HI> seated upon a convenient Bay or Arme of the Sea, about thirty leagues distant from <HI>Puerto Seguro</HI> to the North. There are said to be one hundred or one hundred and fifty Families of Portugheses in it; and a few leagues from it more within land, a Lake of ten or twelve leagues in compass, well stored with good Fish, especially those called <HI>Mana∣ti,</HI> a dainty Fish for meat, as hath been said, and so big, that, as <HI>Laet</HI> reporteth, some of them here are found of a thousand or eleven hundred pound weight, and sometimes more. The Portugheses hereabouts would quickly grow rich by the aboundance of sugar-Canes and good Cattel which the Countrie breeds, but for the <HI>Guaymuri,</HI> as they call them, which are a sort of Savages of Gigantine size and stature, as they say, much more fierce and cruel than others, and which doe very much infest their quarters.</P>
<P>The Prefecture of <HI>Todos los Santos,</HI> in eng∣lish <HI>All Saints,</HI> lying upon a goodly and spa∣cious Bay called likewise the Bay of <HI>All Saints,</HI> thirty leagues distant from <HI>Dos Ilheos</HI> above∣said,
<PB N="446" REF="233"/>
and is a very convenient and safe Harbour for shipping in those Seas, which are sometimes not a little stormy and tempestuous. Its a place very well fortified, and especially me∣morable for a brave exploit performed there by <HI>Peter Heynes</HI> a Dutch man, and Admiral of a squadron of <HI>States</HI> ships in the year 1627, who, as 'tis said, only with his own ship (the rest of his company not being able to follow him) thrust into a Fleet of Spaniards, of no less than twenty six sail, that lay at Anchor in the Bay, and having sunk their Admiral, took all the rest at Mercy, and carried them out with him in spite of some other ships that lay there, and the Castle, and above fourty pieces of Or∣dinance planted on the shore. Their chief Towns are <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> built on a little hill on the North side of the Bay. It is a walled Town, and fortified with no less than three strong Castles, yet surprized by the Dutch in the year 1624, but lost again the next year following, as they would make us believe, by the treachery of some of their own compa∣nie.</P>
<P>The Prefecture of <HI>Fernambuck,</HI> held to be one of the richest and best of the Countrie, both for Tobacco, Sugar, and great quantity of Brasil wood, which is yeerly brought from

thence. Their chief Towns are first <HI>Olinda,</HI> the biggest Town and best Peopled of all <HI>Brasil,</HI> containing by estimation above two thousand persons Portugheses, not reckoning Ecclesia∣sticks and Religious men into the number; of which yet there are many. It lyeth toward the Sea side, but upon such an uneven ground that it is not apt to be fortified otherwise then it is by Nature; neither is the Haven so great as a Town of such Trading would require; yet is it fortified with a Castle and some pieces of Ordinance. The Castle and a great part of the suburbs along the Coast, were surprized by the English under Captain <HI>Lancaster</HI> in the year 1595, and a rich prize of the chief Com∣modities of <HI>Brasil</HI> and <HI>India</HI> brought from thence; and in the year 1630 the Town it self, Castle and all taken by the Dutch, who there∣upon became Masters of this whole Prefecture, which they held for many years together a∣gainst the Spaniards, but have since lost it wholly again to the Portughese. 2. <HI>Garasa,</HI> five leagues distant from <HI>Olinda,</HI> a small Town but holding likewise some little Commerce with the Sea, by the benefit of a River upon which it standeth. 3. <HI>Amatta de Brasil.</HI> 4. <HI>San.

<P><PB N="448" REF="234"/>The Prefecture of <HI>Tamaraca;</HI> so called from a little Island lying before it, and part of its Precinct. It is counted the first, that is, the most ancient Prefectship of <HI>Brasil,</HI> having otherwise nothing in it that is very considera∣ble, save only a good Haven or Port, with a Castle, for the security and command of it, held to be impregnable.</P>
<P>The Prefecture of <HI>Parayba,</HI> so called from the chief Town of the Province, upon the banks of the River <HI>S. Domingo,</HI> and at the bot∣tome of a Bay or Arm of the Sea, by which ships of good burthen come up even close to the Town. Its inhabited by above five hun∣dred Portugheses, a walled Town and likewise fortified with a Castle upon <HI>Cape Delo,</HI> neer adjoyning to it.</P>
<P>The Prefecture of <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> or <HI>the great River,</HI> a small Precinct on the South-side of <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> where it falls into the Sea. It was once possessed by the French about the year 1597, who were outed by the Portugheses, and the place fortified both against them and the Savages, with a Castle, which the Dutch in the yeare 1631 found an impregnable piece, and too hard for them: and besides this there is not much in the whole Prefectship that seems memorable.</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="234"/>The Prefecture of <HI>Siara,</HI> in which they seem to have as little, that is, no Towns of note, only a Castle and some few houses for those that attend the gathering of Cotton-wooll, some Chrystal, and other precious stones, which the Countrie is said to afford.</P>
<P>The Prefecture of <HI>Maragnon:</HI> This is an Island lying at the mouth of the great River <HI>Maragnon</HI> in the furthest parts of <HI>Brasil</HI> Northward.

The French were once Ma∣sters of it, <HI>viz.</HI> about the year 1612, when they built the strong Fort called <HI>St. Lewis,</HI> upon the principall Bay or Port belonging to the Island, and planted twenty two good pieces of Ordinance upon it, and by the pains of some Religious men among them, began to doe much good upon the Natives, by redu∣cing them to Civility and good Man∣ners, and instructing them in the true know∣ledge of God and of Christian Religion: But were soon after, <HI>viz.</HI> in the year 1614, driven out by the Portughese, under the command of <HI>Hierom de Albuquerque,</HI> who, for the security of the Island against them, and the Natives that took their part, built those other two Forts which are called <HI>St. Maries</HI> and <HI>St. Francis,</HI> and likewise two Towns more within the Island, which he founded and Peopled, naming the one of them <HI>St. Andrew,</HI> which lyes towards the North; and the other <HI>St. James,</HI> towards the South.</P>

<HI>Guiana,</HI> so called from the River <HI>Para,</HI> which runneth through the midst of it, upon which, in a convenient place, and upon raised ground, the Portugheses have built a very strong Castle, well walled on all sides, save only towards the River, where it is planted with Ordinance. It is built in a Quadrangular form, and hath at least 300 persons of the Portughese Nati∣on (beside the Garrison Souldiers) belonging to it, who have all imployment enough about the Cotton-wooll, sugar-Canes, and Tobacco, which the Countrie is said to afford in good plenty.</P>

To∣wards the Sea side it is for the most part a flat and level Countrie; in the more Inland parts Mountainous and swelled with Hills; but in all generally of such a rich and fertil Soil, that for F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uits, or any outward Commodities of the Earth, it yeelds not to any other Province of the New-World, but rather farre excelleth the most; having, as it were a continual Sum∣mer, without Winter or Autumn, the Trees never uncloathed or made bare, Fruits alwaies ripe, or growing to maturity, the Meadows and Pastures alwaies Verdant and green: and, as we said so excellently well watered with Rivers, that no Countrie in the World seems comparable to it in this respect: And by the principall of them it is divided into four infe∣riour

nothing more in the discovery of it than for∣mer have done, it must pass for the Metropolis of <HI>Ʋtopia</HI> still, as I think most men take it to be. Places of less Magnificence, but more Cer∣tainty are first <HI>Caripo:</HI> This was once a Colo∣ny of English setled there by Captain <HI>Robert Harcourt,</HI> in the year 1608, upon the banks of <HI>Wiapoco,</HI> and not farre from the mouth of it; being a place, by advantage of a Rock, which it hath on the one side of it, of good strength and very difficult access, the Aire about it sound, and said to be very agreeable to English bodies. 2. <HI>Gomaribo,</HI> a Colony formerly of the Dutch, on the North-west side of the Bay of <HI>Wiapoco,</HI> but since deserted by them. 3. <HI>Moyemon.</HI> 4. <HI>Crewinay,</HI> both of them Towns of the Natives, not farre distant from the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Orenoque,</HI> or the third devision of this Province, comprehendeth the most Northerly parts of <HI>Guiana,</HI> lying upon or towards the banks of this famous River. A Countrie like∣wise reported to be very rich, and comparable to <HI>Peru</HI> it self for hidden Treasure; which, they say, is not yet discovered, only for want of diligent and industrious searching. The pla∣ces in it already known are only 1. <HI>Coniolaba,</HI> as they call it, which seems to be some Town
<PB N="456" REF="238"/>
of the Natives, lying a few leagues distant from the <HI>Orenoque</HI> towards the South. 2. <HI>Mo∣vequito,</HI> a known Port or Haven Town upon a branch of the <HI>Orenoque,</HI> much frequented and of great use to the English, when they discovered those coasts. 3. <HI>Wenicapora:</HI> And lastly <HI>St. Thome,</HI> the only Town which the Spaniards hold upon this part of the Conti∣nent, situate upon the principall Channel of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enoque,</HI> and consisting of two hundred Families or thereabouts. It is now a fortified place; and was taken by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> in that unfortunate Action of 1617, for which the year following (though by vertue of an old attainder, as some say) he lost his head.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Islands that belong, and are com∣monly reckoned as parts of <HI>Guiana,</HI> are either such as lye scattered about the shore of the Province, or such as are found at the mouth, and sometimes farre within the Channel of those great Rivers which empty themselves at several parts out of this Countrie into the Sea, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Trinidado</HI> lyeth at the mouth of the River <HI>Orenoque,</HI> over against the Countrie of <HI>Paria,</HI>
<PB N="457" REF="238"/>
from which it is separated by a Fryth or nar∣row Sea, which <HI>Columbus</HI> at his first discovery of it, and from the difficulty of the passage, (by reason of some lesser Islands scattered up and down in the Channel, and through which the Sea breaks with a great deal of force) cal∣led <HI>Boca del Dragro,</HI> or the Dragons mouth. It lyeth betwixt the ninth and tenth degrees of Northern latitude, accounted to be in length about 24. or tweny five leagues, and about eighteen in breadth, of a cloudy and less plea∣sant aire, yet the Soil good, and aboundantly well stored with all Commodities of the natu∣ral growth of <HI>America, viz.

The chief Town of this Island is called <HI>St. Josephs,</HI> situate on the banks of a little River, which they call <HI>Carone,</HI> on the South side of the Island; which was likewise taken by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> in the year abovesaid and in it the Governour <HI>An∣tonio Berreo,</HI> who, to procure his liberty or

South, <HI>viz.</HI> the new Kingdome of <HI>Granada, &amp;c.</HI> It hath on the East <HI>Guiana,</HI> and those Islands which lye about the mouth of <HI>Orenoque;</HI> on the West the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Venezuela,</HI> with some part of the New Kingdome above∣said; on the North it is washed with the At∣lantick Ocean, and hath on the South some Countries not yet discovered, toward the <HI>An∣des.</HI> The whole consisteth partly of Continent and partly of Islands, neer adjoyning to it; and is commonly divided into five several Pre∣cincts or parts, which are 1. <HI>Cumana.</HI> 2. <HI>Ve∣nezuela.</HI> 3. <HI>Margarita.</HI> 4. <HI>Cubagna:</HI> And 5. some lesser Islands.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cumana</HI> is bounded Eastward with the Gulf of <HI>Paria,</HI> and the River <HI>Orenoque;</HI> on the West with <HI>Venezuela:</HI> Northward it hath the Atlantick Ocean; and on the South those undiscovered Countries above mentioned: containing in length two hundred leagues or more, as some say, and not much less than one hundred in breadth; but for ought appears, little of it planted or used, save only upon the Sea side, where the Coast hath formerly been much famed for the rich Trade of Pearls and Pearl-Fishing; which failing, its princi∣pall esteem now is for an excellent vein of Salt, which they digg here as out of a Mine,
<PB N="460" REF="240"/>
and gather it naturally made ready to their hands, not half a mile from the Sea side, on the back-side of the Promontory or Cape, cal∣led by some <HI>Punto de Araya,</HI> and by others for this reason <HI>Cape de Salinas.</HI> Places of chiefest consideration here are, 1. <HI>Cumana</HI> it self, a Colony of Spaniards seated on the banks of a little River two miles distant from the Sea, where it hath a good Harbour. 2. <HI>St. Jago,</HI> a very strong fortress, which the Spaniards of late yeares have built, for the defence and se∣curity of the Salt-works against the Dutch, who began to trade much that way, and in the yeare 1622, had a design to have made themselves Masters of the Place. 3. <HI>St. Mi∣chael de Neveri,</HI> another Fortress of theirs upon a River so called. 4. <HI>Guaniba,</HI> a Town of the Natives.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Venezuela,</HI> the prineipall part of this Province, is bordered on the East with <HI>Cuma∣na;</HI> on the West with a great Gulf, or Bay, commonly called the Bay of <HI>Venezuela,</HI> with the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke <HI>Maracabo,</HI> and some part of New-Granada; Nothward it hath the Ocean, or Atlantick Sea; southward some undiscovered Countries, which, as we said, lye betwixt the <HI>Andes</HI> and it. It stretches out in length from East to West one hundred and thirty leagues
<PB N="461" REF="240"/>
or thereabouts, but in breadth little more than half so much; being named <HI>Venezuela,</HI> or <HI>Little Venice,</HI> by <HI>Alonso de Oyeda</HI> a Spaniard, who at his first discovery of the Country fell upon a Town of the Natives, which stood like another <HI>Venice,</HI> all upon the waters, and hav∣ing no passage to it, but only by Boats. Its a Country extraordinary rich in all sorts of Commodities, affords good Pasture for Cattel, and aboundance of fair heards of them, Oxen, Sheep, Swine, &amp;c. plenty of Corn and other Grain, great store of Venison likewise in the Woods, of Fish in the Rivers, Gold in the Mines; and therefore not likely but to be well peopled and inhabited, especially by the Spaniards, whose Towns and places of chief importance are these, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Venezuela,</HI> at the most westerly Confines of the Country, built upon the Sea, with the advantage of a double Haven, in a temperate and good Aire, and Soil round about it, the richest and best of the whole Province. It is now a Bishops Sea, who is Suffragan to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>St. Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and the ordinary Residence of the Governour. 2. <HI>Caravalleda,</HI> called by the Spaniards <HI>Nuestra Sennora de Caravalleda,</HI> fourscore leagues distant from <HI>Venezuela</HI> toward the East, upon the Sea,
<PB N="462" REF="241"/>
likewise. 3. <HI>St. Jago de Leon</HI> in the Country of <HI>Caracas</HI> four or five leagues southward of <HI>Caravalleda,</HI> and six or seven distant from the Sea. 4. <HI>New-Valentia,</HI> twenty five leagues distant from <HI>St. Jago.</HI> 5. <HI>New-Xeres,</HI> a Town but lately built fifteen leagues south∣ward of <HI>New Valentia.</HI> 6. <HI>New-Segovia,</HI> but one league distant from <HI>Xeres.</HI> 7. <HI>Tucuyo</HI> a place well known and frequented, for the aboundance of Sugar which is made there, and in the Country round about it. 8. <HI>Truxillo,</HI> or our Lady <HI>de la Paz,</HI> eighteen leagues south∣ward of the Lake <HI>Maracaybo,</HI> a place of great resort, and much frequented for trade both by Spaniards and Natives. 9. <HI>Laguna,</HI> a Town lying more towards the bottom of the Lake, said to be much haunted with Tygres; and more than this, not much is said of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Margarita</HI> is an Island lying right over against the <HI>Salinas,</HI> or Cape <HI>de Araya</HI> afore mentioned, seven or eight leagues distant from the Main-land, and taking its name from the aboundance of Pearles found about it, when time was. It containes not above fif∣teen or sixteen leagues in length, and about six in breath, having these only places of im∣portance in it, <HI>viz. Mon Pater,</HI> which is a good Fort of the Spaniards built at the East An∣gle
<PB N="463" REF="241"/>
of the Island, to secure their Pearl-fishing when that Trade held, and to defend their ships, which commonly rode there at Anchor. 2. the Valley of <HI>Sta. Lucia,</HI> two leagues di∣stant from the Sea, where the Spaniards have a Colony. 3. <HI>Makanao,</HI> a Town of the Na∣tives. This whole Island was surprised by the English under Captain <HI>Parker</HI> in the yeare 1601, who in stead of Prisoners carryed a∣way good store of the Spaniards Pearl, which he forced them to pay for their ran∣some.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Cubagna,</HI> another Island pertaining to this Province of <HI>Paria,</HI> lyeth almost in the midle way betwixt the Island <HI>Margarita</HI> and the Continent; from which last it is not coun∣ted to be above a league distant, and five or six from the other; being it self in the com∣pass of the whole, not much above three or four: of a Soil wholy barren and destitute of all kinde of necessaries for the life and susti∣nance of man, without Corn, without Pastu∣rage, without Fruit, without water; yet only for the richness of the Pearl-fishing round a∣about it, for many yeares together, there was no place more frequented than it. Nor is it at present wholly deserted: for though the Trade of Pearls be said to have failed for some
<PB N="464" REF="242"/>
yeares, yet have they a Colony still remaining there, called <HI>New-Cadiz;</HI> and on the East part of the Islands a certain Fountain, not far from the Sea side, which yeeldeth a kinde of Bituminous substance like Oyle, of such a me∣dicinable vertue for many diseases, that it suffi∣ciently recompenseth the want of the Pearls by a more reall utillity and benefit, &amp; is found in good plenty floating for the most part up∣on the Sea thereabout.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lesser Islands (as they are called) part of this Provinciall Prefecture of <HI>Paria,</HI> lie all along upon the coasts of <HI>Venezuela</HI> from East to West; in number many, but the principal of them are 1. <HI>Tortuga,</HI> a little Island said to be not above four or five miles in length, and in breadth hardly one, but well know for the aboundance of good Salt that is made, and transported thence every yeare; it lieth five or six leagues westward of <HI>Margarita;</HI> hath a good Harbour, and aboundance of that wood called <HI>Guaiacum,</HI> of which we spake before. 2. <HI>Bonayre</HI> an Island of five or six leagues in compass, well stored with small Cattell, especially Sheep and Goates. It lyeth right over against the Bay called <HI>Golfo Triste,</HI> or the <HI>Ʋnfortunate B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> and was the place whether the Spaniards transplanted the poor
<PB N="465" REF="242"/>
Natives of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> when they grew weary of killing them. 3. <HI>Curacaos</HI> three or four leagues westward of <HI>Bonayre,</HI> and containing about so many in compass, of a soil excee∣dingly fertill and good for Pasturage, having likewise on the north side of the Island a very good and safe Harbour for shipping. 4. <HI>Aru∣ba,</HI> three or four leagues distant from <HI>Cura∣caos</HI> to the North-east, about five miles in compass, being for the most part a level and flat Country, inhabited, but not much, either by Spaniards or Natives. 5. <HI>Los Monges,</HI> or the <HI>Monks,</HI> as the Spaniards named them: These are three or four lesser Island lying east∣ward of the <HI>Cape Coquibocoa</HI> of great use and direction at Sea, to those that sail for <HI>Cartha∣gena,</HI> but for any thing else scarsely memo∣rable.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the American Islands.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. VVE have spoken hitherto only of the Continent of <HI>Ameri∣ca,</HI> and those Islands, which lye so neer the Continent, that they are commonly reckoned as part of it, and appertaining to the respective Provinces against which they lie. It remains now, (not to leave any thing considerable un∣touch'd at least) that we take a veiw of some other Islands <HI>viz.</HI> that lie further off and seem not to have any other relation to <HI>America,</HI> but only that of obedience and subjection to the Spaniards government, who are Lords of <HI>A∣merica,</HI> and have reduced at least the princi∣pall and chief of those Islands, long since un∣der their power. They lye either in the South or the North Sea. Those in the South, or <HI>Mare del Zur</HI> are chiefly two, <HI>viz. Los Ladrones,</HI> and the Islands <HI>Fernandinae. Los Ladrones,</HI> in English, the Islands of Theeves, lye as it were
<PB N="467" REF="243"/>
in the midle way betwixt the Main-land of <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>Philippine Islands,</HI> but some hundred of leagues distant from either, in the fourth degree of Northern latitude. So na∣med by <HI>Ferdinand Magellan,</HI> from the pilfe∣ring disposition he observed in the Natives, when he sailed that way for the <HI>Moluccae</HI> I∣slands. They were a nimble and active sort of People, yet light-fingerd, it should seem, and going for the most part naked, tall of stature, excellent Swimmers and Divers, and have not much more to be spoken in their Commen∣dation. The <HI>Fernandinae</HI> are only two Islands of no great bigness lying over against the coast of <HI>Chile,</HI> in the three and thirtieth degree of Southern latitude, and about one hundred leagues, or three hundred English miles from the Continent: yet well stored with some lesser sort of Cattel, as Goats, &amp;c. good plenty likewise of Venison in the Woods, and of Fish upon the Coasts: for which rea∣son, though lying at some distance, yet are they not a little frequented by the Spaniards of <HI>Peru;</HI> who finde many good Harbours and roads for shipping belonging to, and about these Islands.</P>
<P>But the chief, <HI>viz.</HI> of the American Islands
<PB N="468" REF="244"/>
abovesaid, are those which lye in the Atlantick or North-Sea, on the East side, and as it were in the way to the Continent of <HI>America;</HI> which are as follow, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The <HI>Caribes.</HI> 2. <HI>Port-rico.</HI> 3. <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> 4. <HI>Cuba,</HI> and 5. <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>Caribee</HI> Islands.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THe <HI>Caribee</HI>-Islands (as the En∣glish commonly call them) are a row or ridge, as it were of lesser Islands, which extend themselves, al∣most in fashion of a Bow, from the Coast of <HI>Paria,</HI> as far as <HI>St. John de Port-rico:</HI> The name signifies as much as the Islands of Canni∣bals, or <HI>Man-Eaters;</HI> and so the Natives ge∣nerally were, before they were either destroy∣ed or reduced to better manners by the Spa∣niards. There are many of them, but the prin∣cipall and those which seem most worthy of notice are, 1. <HI>Granada:</HI> This lyeth in form of a Croissant or half-Moon, upon the Conti∣nent of <HI>Paria, viz.</HI> that part of it which is called <HI>Cuniana;</HI> having a reasonable good
<PB N="469" REF="244"/>
Haven, and a Soil not altogether unfruitfull, but much over-shaded with Woods, and hi∣therto but little inhabited. 2. <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> six or seven leagues Northward of <HI>Granada,</HI> but from any part of the Continent ten at least: a very fruitfull Island, yeelding aboun∣dance of Sugar-Canes that grow naturally without any Art or help of Husbandry; well watered with Rivers, and affording many convenient Bays and safe roads for shipping. It lyeth in a circular form, and is thought to contain about eight or ten leagues in compass; Inhabited by a People not over much industri∣ous, nor sollicitous for ought but what con∣cerns the belly. 3. <HI>Dominica,</HI> an Island of twelve leagues in length, very fruitfull of a good sort of Tobacco, which the Europeans have of the Natives chiefly in exchange of Knives, some Hatchets, and other Instruments of Iron, which they value much. It hath on the West side of it a convenient Harbour for ships; but the People being said to continue Cannibals, and exceedingly barbarous, even to this present, no Nations as yet, have attemp∣ted to inhabit among them. 4. <HI>La Desseada,</HI> a small Island, but of great use to the Spani∣ards, who alwaies touch at it both coming and
<PB N="470" REF="245"/>
going. 5. <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> another small Island, which they likewise take in their way continu∣ally to and from <HI>America:</HI> it serves them chiefly for fresh water, and lyeth eight or ten leagues Westward of <HI>Desseada.</HI> 6. <HI>Antego,</HI> as the English corruptly call it, rather <HI>Antiqua,</HI> is an Island of about seven leagues in length, and almost as much in breadth, lying to the North-East of <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> where the English of late years are said to have planted a Colony, but wherein their Trade lyeth, doth not so well appear. 7. <HI>St. Christophers:</HI> This lyeth on the North-west of <HI>Guadalupe;</HI> where the English and French (both of them) having planted their several Colonies, were, not many years since, outed by the Spainyards, yet per∣mitted quietly to pass to their other Plantati∣ons. The chief Commoditie which the Coun∣trie yeeldeth is Tobacco; and in the Easterly parts of it some Salt. 8. <HI>Barbados:</HI> This is an Island at the North-East of <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> of an ovall form, and of the same bigness or extent with that of <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> that is, containing in the compass of the whole a matter of eigh∣teen or twenty miles. It lyeth the most Easter∣ly of all the rest of these Islands; of a Soil very lusty and good, especially for such Com∣modities
<PB N="471" REF="245"/>
as are proper for it. On the East side it hath many Angles and Points shooting out into the Sea, which consequently make many Bays upon the Coast of it; but, by reason of certain quick-sands which lye before them, not much used or frequented by ships. On the South side it hath a large and convenient Har∣bour, capable of the tallest ships, and well fre∣quented. It is counted now one of the best Colonies of the English, but said to have been heretofore not a little at the mercy of the Spa∣niard Their chief Trade is Tobacco, and a kinde of course Sugar, which we call <HI>Barbados-Su∣gar,</HI> and will not keep long; not that the Countrie is unapt for better, but, as 'tis rather supposed, because the Planters want either skill, or stock, to improve things to the best. The Countrie is somewhat hot, and it behoves an English man to be very temperate and wary, when he goes first thither. 9. <HI>Sta. Crux,</HI> called by the Natives anciently <HI>Ayay,</HI> fifteen leagues distant from <HI>Port-rico</HI> to the South-East, woody and Mountainous, having on the West side of it a convenient Harbour for ship∣ing. They speak of a certain Fruit of this Countrie not unlike to a green Apple; which if a Man eat, it causeth such an inflammation
<PB N="472" REF="246"/>
and swelling of his tongue, that for twenty four hours space at least, he looseth the use of it quite; but afterwards it asswageth of it self without further hurt: And also of certain Fen-waters, with which, if a Man chance to wash his face before noon, it likewise swells so much presently, that his eyes will be closed up; but in the afternoon no such matter; which I mention, because they say there is a Colony of English setled there of late years. There be many other of these <HI>Caribee</HI> Islands beside, as namely <HI>Anguilla, Barbada, St. Bartholmews, Las Nieves, St. Lucies, St. Martins, Monts∣errat, &amp;c.</HI> but of so little consideration, espe∣cially to our Nation, that it would seem but tedious to mention them further.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>POrt-rico</HI> is an Island fifteen leagues distant from <HI>Sta.

or one hundred and thirty six, as some reckon. It lyeth almost in a Quadrangular form, being supposed to contain about thirty leagues in length, and not less than twenty in breadth, in eighteen and nineteen degrees of Northern-latitude. The Aire reasonably tem∣perate and agreeable, not scorched with any excessive heats in Summer, nor beaten with those continuall rains, to which some parts of <HI>America</HI> are subject, in Winter: its greatest annoyance being from those sudden and vio∣lent tempests, which they call <HI>Hurricanoes,</HI> which infest it very much, especially in the moneths of <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September.</HI> The Soil fruitfull enough, affording aboundance of Su∣gar-Canes, Ginger, <HI>Cassia,</HI> Hides, and divers other rich Commodities. As concerning the Mines both of gold and silver, which were once certainly known to be there, some say they are exhausted and spent long since; others think that's but a pretence of the Spaniards, to keep strangers from looking into the Country, while they themselves are more busied within Land. It is divided almost in the midst from East to West with a ridge of Mountains which the Spaniards call <HI>Sierra del Loquillo,</HI> and hath these Towns of chief note and importance,

<HI>viz.</HI> first <HI>Port-rico</HI> it self, commonly called <HI>St. John de Port-rico,</HI> a strong and neat Town well built in a little Island by it self, but joyn∣ed to the other by certain huge piles of Tim∣ber-work, of vast labour and expence, done by command of <HI>Philip</HI> the second, King of <HI>Spain.</HI> It was attempted by Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in the year 1595 without success, but a few years af∣ter taken by the Earl of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> as hath been said. 2. <HI>St. Germans</HI> in the West parts of the Island, three or four leagues distant from the Sea, a place, as 'tis said to be, neither fortified nor much frequented. 3. <HI>Luysay</HI> on the East side, a good and well frequented Port, some leagues distant from <HI>Port-rico.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Eastward of <HI>Port-rico,</HI> and betwixt it and <HI>Hispaniola</HI> there lyeth a little, but fruitfull Island called <HI>Mona;</HI> and Westward of that another called <HI>Monico,</HI> or <HI>Monetta,</HI> which last the English, when time was, found so admira∣bly stored with a sort of wilde Fowl, that the huge flights of them seemed to darken the Aire over their heads, and upon their landing found such plenty of their eggs upon the shore and ground thereabouts, that they presently laded two of their boats with them.

afternoon, by a constant winde from the Sea, which they call there <HI>Virason.</HI> It is, for the fer∣tility of the Soil, the richest and most flourish∣ing Countrie (one of them) in the World; the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees and all things else there, continually clad, as it were, in their Summer livery, the Mea∣dows and Pastures alwaies green, and of such an excellent Herbage, that Cattel both breed and thrive there almost beyond beleef; both great Cattel and small, as Kine, Sheep, Hogs, &amp;c. brought thither out of <HI>Spain,</HI> having mul∣tiplyed to such numbers, that they live wilde now in Heards, as hath been said, and are both hunted and killed, like Stags or other Venison only for their Hides, which they send yeerly into <HI>Spain</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as a great Merchandise and Commoditie of huge profit to them. So plentifull of Sugar-Canes, that 'tis thought no less than one thousand Chests of refined Sugar are sent out of this only Island one year with another. Nor was it for∣merly without good Mines, both of gold and silver; which whether they be now wasted and wholly exhaust, or only neglected for want of Miners to work in them, time may shew. Of Brass and Iron they have many good Mines at present, of no small profit and ad∣vantage
<PB N="477" REF="248"/>
to them. The whole Island is said to be naturally divided, as it were, into four se∣veral quarters, by four several Rivers, arising out of one and the same Mountain almost in the midst of the Island, that is to say, 1. <HI>Jache.</HI> which runneth Northward. 2. <HI>Nubila,</HI> to∣wards the South. 3. <HI>Yunna,</HI> or <HI>Junna,</HI> to the East: And 4. <HI>Hatebonico,</HI> to the West: but others (it must be confessed) mention the same Rivers without any such speciall obser∣vation. The chief Towns and places of this Island inhabited by Spaniards are first <HI>St. Do∣mingo,</HI> on the South side of the Island, built first by <HI>Bartholmew Columbus,</HI> in the year 1594, on the banks of <HI>Ozama</HI> one of the fairest Rivers of the Country, towards the Sea side; where it hath l kewise a good Haven or Port, and on the West side of it a strong Castle. Its a place of great honor and dignity at pre∣sent, being an Archbishops Sea, and the ordi∣nary Residence of the Governor and supream Courts for these parts of <HI>America,</HI> but flou∣rished more formerly with resort and multi∣tudes of people, than now it doth; which is attributed to the later discoveries of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> by occasion whereof aboundance of the Inhabitants, and not a little of the trade
<PB N="478" REF="249"/>
likewise hath been drawn from it. 2. <HI>Salvaleon</HI> twenty eight leagues distant from <HI>St. Domingo</HI> towards the East. 3. <HI>Juguana,</HI> or <HI>Sta. Maria del Puerto,</HI> in the more western parts of the Island, a small Town not above a league di∣stant from the Sea, where it hath a good Ha∣ven, but supposed not to be much fortified. 4. <HI>Cotuy,</HI> once a rich Town in the North parts of the Island, and well frequented: now said to be in a manner deserted. 5. <HI>Conception de la Vega,</HI> built by <HI>Columbus</HI> himself, and from whence he had his Title Duke <HI>de la Vega:</HI> it lyeth twenty or thirty leagues northward of <HI>St. Domingo.</HI> 6. <HI>Puerto de la Plata,</HI> or the <HI>Silver-Haven,</HI> fourty leagues distant from <HI>St. Domingo</HI> likewise towards the North, it is the second Town for wealth and trade in the whole Island, commodiously seated on a Bay, or Arme of the Sea, and fortified with a Castle. 7. <HI>Azua,</HI> or <HI>New-Compostella,</HI> twenty four miles, or eight leagues westward of <HI>St. Domingo</HI> and a place much frequented by reason of the good sugar-Canes, which the Country thereabouts yeeldeth. There is like∣wise 8. <HI>St. Jago de los Cavalleros,</HI> ten leagues northward of <HI>La Vega.</HI> 9. <HI>Monte Christo,</HI> fourteen leagues westward of <HI>Plata,</HI> and
<PB N="479" REF="249"/>
lastly 10. <HI>Zeybo</HI> on the South-side of the I∣sland, twenty leagues distant from <HI>St. Domin∣go;</HI> all of them pleasant and handsome Towns, and well seated, but destitute of Inhabitants very much: as likewise the whole Island gene∣rally is; the Natives being all destroyed, or Transplanted long since, and the Spaniards themselves, by the following discoveries and conquests upon the Continent, invited to bet∣ter quarters.</P>

<P N="1">1. VVEstward, or rather to the North-weast of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> lyeth <HI>Cuba,</HI> parted from the other by a Frith, or narrow Channel, which runneth betwixt the Capes of <HI>St. Nicholas,</HI> belonging to <HI>Hi∣spaniola,</HI> and that called <HI>Mayzi</HI> belonging to <HI>Cuba.</HI> On the North it hath a Frie of little Islands, called, as above said, the <HI>Leucayae</HI> I∣slands, so many and so thick scattered, that they serve for no small security and defence of the Island on that side; beside a part of the <HI>Pen∣insula</HI> of <HI>Florida</HI> which coasteth it likewise
<PB N="480" REF="250"/>
Northward; on the west it hath the Country of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> which is part of the Continent, but at a distance of fourty or fifty leagues; and on the South <HI>Jamaica.</HI> It is reckoned to be in length from Cape <HI>Mayzi,</HI> which looks towards <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> to the Cape of <HI>St. Antho∣ny</HI> which is upon the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> two hundred and thirty leagues; but in breadth neither proportionable nor certain; being in some places not above fifteen or sixteen leagues over; &amp; in none above fourty. But for fertility of soil contending with <HI>Hispaniola</HI> it self, and for temperature &amp; healthiness of aire much exceeding it: nor less rich formerly in good Mines both of gold and silver, plentifully stored at present, not only with Sugar-Canes of the best growth, but likewise with aboundance of Ginger-roots, <HI>Cassia Fistula,</HI> Mastique, A∣loes, Cynnamon, Long-Pepper of <HI>America,</HI> as they call it, and divers sorts of spices. The Pastures no less abounding with Cattell of all sorts, especially of European breed; the Rivers and coasts of the Sea with good Fish: no scarsity of Fowl whether wild or tame; good Mines of Brass and Iron still found, with some Gold in the Rivers, especially those which fall into the Bay <HI>Pagua</HI> or the
<PB N="481" REF="250"/>
south-side of the Island. The Woods, where the Country is mountainous and rocky as in some parts it is, well replenished with Tim∣ber, and many odoriferous trees beside, from which they gather a certain Rosin, or Gumme, not less precious and usefull than the <HI>Storax,</HI> or sweet Gumme so called, of which the Her∣borists speak so much. In a word the only in∣convenience which the Spaniards found in it, was from Serpents, which the Natives out of an old superstition among them, had preser∣ved so long, they came to bee grieviously an∣noyed by them at last; and when they would have destroyed them, could not; what remedy the Spaniards have since provided against them, appeares not. The River <HI>Caute,</HI> which is one of the chiefest Rivers of the Island, is still said to be much haunted with Crocodiles; that are very dangerous to strangers unacquainted with the Country, and to any that rest or sleep neer the banks of the River.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Towns and places of chief impor∣tance belonging to this Island are, 1. <HI>St. Jago,</HI> seated at the bottom of a large and capa∣cious Bay on the South-side of the Island, two or three leagues distant from the Sea, and counted the chiefest Port on that side. It is a Bishops sea, and once a very populous and rich
<PB N="482" REF="251"/>
place of trade, but at present not a little de∣cayed, only for want of Inhabitants, who are advanced more up into the Continent, having left the Islands behinde them more than half empty. Neer unto this place, <HI>viz.</HI> about three or four leagues distance, are those famous Mountains, which the Spaniards call <HI>Sierras de Cobre,</HI> or the <HI>Brass Mountains,</HI> from the aboundance of that Metal which the Mines in them doe still afford, 2. <HI>Baracao,</HI> thirty leagues Eastward of <HI>St. Jago</HI> toward the Sea. 3. <HI>Bayamo,</HI> or <HI>St. Salvador,</HI> seated more within land in a rich and pleasant part of the Island, but not so commodious for trade. 4. <HI>Puerto del Principe</HI> on the North side of the Island fourty leagues distant from <HI>St. Jago,</HI> neer to which, saith <HI>Laet,</HI> there is a Foun∣tain, which sendeth forth a liquor of a Bituminous substance, and black as Pitch, very good and much used in those parts for the calking of Ships, and gathered in great abundance upon the Sea, into which it falleth, and is sometimes digged also, as out of a Mine. 6. <HI>La Trinidad</HI> nine or ten leagues Eastward of the Bay of <HI>Xagua.</HI> Last∣ly 6. <HI>Havana,</HI> the most known and best traded Port absolutely of all these parts, and and perhaps of the whole Continent, ly∣ing
<PB N="483" REF="251"/>
at the most northerly point of the Island towards <HI>Cape Florida;</HI> a place natu∣rally strong, and so well fortified by Art, that it is held impregnable. The entrance whereof is defended on each side with a strong Castle, and a stronger than either built right opposite to the Mouth of the Haven; and all of them so commodiously and advantageously situated for the defence and assistance of each other, (as 'tis said) nothing can be devised better. Close to one of them there is erected a watch-Tower, of such height, that from the top of it, they easily descry whatsoever Ships move upon those Seas, and give notice of them to the Guards; being thereby a very great assurance not only to the Inhabitants of this place and Island, but also to the whole Bay of <HI>Mexico.</HI> And is therefore the ordinary Seat of the Go∣vernour, and the generall Rendezvous of the Spanish Ships, when they goe home for <HI>Spain,</HI> meeting heer from all parts of the Gulf, and tarrying one for another till all be come in, and from thence setting sail for <HI>Spain,</HI> through the <HI>Sreits of Bahama,</HI> and by some of the <HI>Leu∣cayae</HI> Islands above mentioned. It is likewise a very strong Garrison; it being said, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> allowes pay for no less number
<PB N="484" REF="252"/>
than 1000. Souldiers only for this place.</P>
<P><HI>Jamaica</HI> is somewhat a lesser Island, lying Southward of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and to the West of <HI>Hi∣spaniola,</HI> almost at an equall distance, <HI>viz</HI> twenty leagues from them both. They reckon it to be in length about fifty leagues or more in breadth twenty, and to contain in the whole about one hundred and fifty, of a rich and fertil Soil, and in nothing less provided for the necessities of mans life, than either <HI>Hi∣spaniola</HI> or <HI>Cuba;</HI> well stock'd with Cattel, and as plentifully stored with Fruits of all sorts, yeelding abundance of Cotton-wooll, more than either of the other Islands: only it wanteth the conveniency of some good Ha∣vens and Ports, which it hath but few; and the Sea round about it so shelvy, and full of Rocks and broken Islands, that the coast of it is held to be not a little dangerous: and therefore as little frequented by Merchants or others. There being at present three only small Towns inhabited in the whole Island, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Sevilla,</HI> or <HI>New-Sevill,</HI> in the North parts of the Island. 2. <HI>Melilla</HI> ten leagues distant from <HI>Sevill</HI> towards the East. And lastly <HI>Oristan,</HI> 14. leagues distant from it towards the South.</P>
