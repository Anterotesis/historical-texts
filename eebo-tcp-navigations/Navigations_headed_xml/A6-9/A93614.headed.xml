<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From <HI>Rome</HI> the <HI>4.</HI> of <HI>September, 1642.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here is a great Tumult between the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadout and the <HI>Portingall</HI> Ambassadour, so that the <HI>French</HI> that live in <HI>Rome</HI> tooke the <HI>Portingalls</HI> part, and came so far that if the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassadour had not saved himselfe in the Popes house, he had been slaine. Thereupon the Pope hath caused to be proclaimed, that all vagabonds and idle persons shall depart <HI>Rome;</HI> which if this Proclamation be well executed, they will halfe unpeople <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From <HI>Uttecht</HI> the <HI>7.</HI> of <HI>September.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Here is no Trading that flourisheth better then those that make inventi∣ons to kill folkes, they worke night and day and cannot make enough, for they buy all sorts of Armes, and are sent not onely for <HI>England,</HI> but for <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and other parts. Here is for certaine, that the Prince hath given leave to draw out of every <HI>English</HI> Company, two Souldiers, experienced in Armes, and three out of every Colonels Company, to goe they know not where, but sure it is that they goe for <HI>England,</HI> but for whom I know not.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From <HI>Calis</HI> the <HI>15.</HI> of <HI>September.</HI></HEAD>
<P>There is a great dissention between the two Generalls, to wit, of Horse and Foot, the one puts the fault in the other, because their exploit did faile in <HI>France:</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> Generall Don <HI>Francisco,</HI> and the <HI>Italian</HI> Don <HI>Cantelmo,</HI> so that they have small hopes this Sommer: For we have certaine Newes, that the Prince of Orange breaks up and draws his Army, both foot &amp; horse, into Garrison, and leaves the <HI>Hessens</HI> and <HI>Wymers</HI> in Feild, how they will doe this Winter we shall heare.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">

<PB N="2" REF="3"/>his Countrey. The great Master of <HI>France,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bullion,</HI> with the Secretary of <HI>France,</HI> are brought prisoners, and there are 24 deputed to heare their Examination, and it is thought that they will hardly escape with life; yet the Duke of <HI>Bullion</HI> has great friends, the Prince of Orange, the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> with divers Princes of <HI>Germanie,</HI> seeks to mittigate the busines, being that they had attempted something against his Majesty of <HI>France,</HI> which was not, and is not to be written. The <HI>Swedes</HI> continue Victorious in <HI>Moravi</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> takes in Townes and Castles, they have gotten great supply of men and money, so that the Emperour is not able to resist them, specially now that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> can send no succours, and the Pope hath enough to doe with the Prince of <HI>Parma.</HI></P>

<PB N="59" REF="3"/>and run away by multitudes, begging through the Countrey. And we hear daily that the States catch sometimes 1. or 2. of their Fregats, which are their best plundering vessells, for they have nothing loden but men, ammuni∣tion, and victualls, and the last weeke the States men of warre tooke two of them, so that of foure that came out three are taken.</P>

<P>THe Countrey here about is all spoiled with sundrie Armies which lyeth here, so that every thing is very deare, for all the countrey people are fled into this Fown, and lest goods and houses to the disposition of the enemies, being glad onely to save their lives; for we can get no provision from <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> as we were wont to do, because the King of <HI>France</HI> his Army lies be∣tween us and them 30000 strong: likewise the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> lies with his whole Army but two houres going from them.

<PB N="6" REF="4"/>finds them 25000 strong, with 80 peeces of Ordnance, besides the horse which is the flower of his Army, payd the whole Army every one a moneths pay, then they marched towards <HI>Valliciens,</HI> and causeth much ammunition bread to be baked, and commands every Souldier to provide his knapsack for 8 dayes; and came hard by <HI>Callis,</HI> and took the strong Castle of <HI>Oye, Don Cantelmo</HI> Generall of the horse, dividing his Army into three wings, march∣ed by night between <HI>Ardes</HI> and <HI>Bullin,</HI> and took in two Forts by <HI>Callis,</HI> cutting off the passage of the Town of <HI>Ardes</HI> that <HI>Callis</HI> could have no succour. <HI>Can∣telmo</HI> hath also taken the Fort St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> so that it will be hard for the <HI>French</HI> to get out the <HI>Spaniard:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Generall Count <HI>Harcourt</HI> lets them alone and is marched into the Count of <HI>Haynow,</HI> whas he will do we shall hear. From <HI>Ostend, Newport</HI> and <HI>Graveling,</HI> we hear they make great preparation to send out great store of armed shipping, but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> ships keeps them in And this last week our Statesmen of warre hath taken a well mounted ship with 16 peeces of Ordnance, and 100 men, being the first voyage that it made.</P>
<P>We have certain news that the <HI>French</HI> men hath taken all the Castles and Forts that they had lost, and were taken by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but they are beaten out with great losse of blood.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bullin</HI> is brought prisoner to <HI>Lyons,</HI> the <HI>Cardinall</HI> is likewise gone thither: tis greatly to be feared but he will suffer, being that the <HI>Cardinal</HI> is his great enemy.</P>
<P>The Princesse of <HI>Orange</HI> is brought to bed of a young daughter, which is the cause of much joy.</P>
<P>There are letters come to the States of certain news that <HI>Perpinian</HI> is taken by the King of <HI>France,</HI> after foure moneths beleaguering, and enduring such hunger that the souldiers have stolne little children and eaten them, after they had eaten all the leather and goat skins that were to be found. The con∣ditions whereupon they rendred, at the next return you shall hear.</P>
<P>A fearfull accident is befallen in one of the States towns, called <HI>Wesell,</HI> some 7 or 8 Waggons going to the Leaguer loden with powder, it seems that there was a barrell that scattered powder as it went, which was the last saving 2. and being behind, the bore whipt his horse to be by the others. The horse strikes fire with his iron shooes, so that waggons, horse, men, all flies in the aire: 60 persons, 25 houses, besides other harms.</P>
<P>Here is a ship come from <HI>Portugall,</HI> brings news that there is a fleet of ships from <HI>Brasillia</HI> with 12000 chests of Sugars, with other Marchandise: and that there was a fleet of ships sailed out, but not knowing where.</P>

<P>Moreover tis said that a whole Dutch myle the ground was covered with dead bodies.</P>
<P>Within these foure dayes there happened a battell between the <HI>Wymars</HI> Army and the Emperours, here in our low Countreys, since that the <HI>States</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>Army departed and came lower into the Land: the <HI>Wymars</HI> are payed by the King of <HI>France,</HI> and the other belonging to the Emperour, and lieth there to defend the City of <HI>Cullen,</HI> these two Armies it seemed fell foule the one of the other: so that there are 3000 horsemen taken prisoners, and 500 slain. The Generall <HI>John de Werth</HI> is likewise taken, which causeth great joy. For this unhappy Generall, if so he may be called, hath been taken once before by the King of <HI>France,</HI> and kept prisoner 4 yeers in the Castle of <HI>Paris,</HI> and now is likely to return again, but hardly never to be relieved.</P>
<P>Here is great talk of the Queens returning into <HI>England,</HI> for the States of <HI>Holland</HI> makes readinesse to give her ships for her safe convoy: if she were go∣ing, there are none would hold.

<P>Last Wednesday 9 ships went out of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> full of men &amp; ammunition, and bound for <HI>Spaine,</HI> but were followed by our Admirall <HI>Martin Tromp,</HI> and after 3 houres fight, one was taken mounted with 20 Petces, 100 Sayl∣lers, and 250 souldiers, being most of them <HI>Bourgunnians,</HI> and <HI>Wallouns:</HI> making their account to go fetch some <HI>Spanish</HI> Gold, but tis mist, upon this ship that was taken in the fight, there was slain 18 men, and 34 hurt: The ship that took her lost 3 men.</P>

<P>The <HI>Swedish</HI> hath had a great Victory against the <HI>Emperialists</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> so that the Emperours Armie is wholly deleated, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> make them∣selves Master of <HI>Bohemia, Moravia,</HI> and <HI>Silesia;</HI> and now that the <HI>Swedes</HI> have got ten thousand <HI>French</HI> men to supply their Army, and that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> cannot helpe the Emperour, so that it will be a cause that the <HI>Swedes</HI> will have a great Victory.</P>

<P>Eighteen <HI>Sutlaers</HI> with horse and carts being set upon by 50 <HI>Saxish</HI> horse-men, pillaged them, and found 8000.

<PB N="60" REF="5"/>
<P>The losse of the Towne of <HI>Perpinian,</HI> and likewise the whole <HI>Spanish Fleet,</HI> coming from <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> with all his treasure, puts him into a great per∣plexitie, that he knows not which way to turne him; for this Fleet before it was cast away, was 17.

<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From <HI>Cullen</HI> the <HI>21.</HI> of <HI>September.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Here is no great Newes, onely the foure Ledgers which lay here, two of the which lyeth still; the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Ledger and the Prince of Orange, they be retired, but we beleeve they will doe nothing this year, for the time will come shortly, that they will be forced to retire into Garrison. What the <HI>Wymers</HI> and the Emperours Armie will doe which lyeth here, we shall short∣ly see. His Highnes the Prince of Orange is come with his Armie to the <HI>Maze,</HI> and in his way hath taken in a strong House called <HI>Bosbergen,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> thought to fortifie, where he hath found great store of Ammu∣nition and provision, and so soone as he hath well fortified the same place, he will retire home to Garrison: it is a place of great importance for these Countreys.</P>
<P>The Generall of the <HI>Wymers</HI> is marched over the River of <HI>Rhyne</HI> with part of his Armie, to fetch in provision out of the neighbouring Countries, and in his going over the Bridge, he gave the keepers of the Bridge 400. Duckets to drinke to his health. There were two Souldiers of the best experimented out of every <HI>English</HI> Company, to goe, as it is thought, for the King of <HI>England;</HI> but they are stayd, and Captain <HI>Flood,</HI> who should have conducted them, is imprisoned in <HI>Dort,</HI> a Towne in <HI>Holland,</HI> and is like to suffer for it, being that the States are very discontented that such things should be done without their knowledge.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From <HI>Paris</HI> the <HI>26.</HI> of <HI>September.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It is for certaine, that the King of <HI>France</HI> since that he hath taken <HI>Perpinian,</HI> and hath strengthened his Army so strong, that he may goe into <HI>Spaine</HI> where he pleaseth, into the Kingdome of <HI>Arragon, Vallencie,</HI> or <HI>Navarre,</HI> so that the Kings of <HI>Spaine</HI> never saw themselves so near home this many years, and is like to see more troubles, for we heare that the Kingdome of <HI>Vallencie</HI> doth follow the steps of <HI>Portingall,</HI> that if they had a sure Head, they would soone rise.</P>
<P>It is likewise assured that Monsieut <HI>le Grand,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>le Thon,</HI> are both beheaded; and for any thing we can heare, that the Duke of <HI>Bullion</HI> is in great danger, his Mother being dead, and all his friends flie from him, excepting the Prince of Orange his Unkle; He hath offered the King of <HI>France</HI> the Towne of <HI>Sedan,</HI> whereof he is a Prince Soveraigne, to save his life; But the Cardinall which governeth the King and Kingdome, saith, that there is no trust in him, and that if he were let goe, he might doe worse then before: It seemes that his fact is hainous, he is here much bemoned, for since his mar∣riage, and his revolting from his Religion, the leaving of his Government of <HI>Mastrich,</HI> and now this bad Enterprise, so that we feare the worst.</P>
