<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE a Poet, in a piece of Satyr, like a Passionate Man in a Skirmish, may by accident offend those he never designed to meddle with, the Author, lest People should think he has too far jested with an Edge-Tool, has thought fit to declare, that he had no other Intention in the following <HI>Poem,</HI> than to apply it as a Carpenter does his Axe, when, to the hazard of its Edge, he strikes at those stubborn and irregular Knots which are a dis∣credit to the Tree, and lessen the value of the Timber: Or as a Surgeon handles his Lancet, when he lays open a corrupt Mem∣ber, which is both troublesome and scandalous to the sound parts of the Body. It is evident enough, there is no Church in the World but what has received some Blemishes from her Priests, meaning some few, who, for want of either Learning, Prudence, or Piety, have been a dishonour to their Function, such only I accuse; and I hope, should I blame <HI>Peter</HI> for denying his Master, or <HI>Ju∣das</HI> for betraying Him, the rest of the Apostles would have no reason to be angry. If I am condemn'd for Arraigning 'em in the Lower Regions, which some of 'em have good reason to hope was prepar'd only for us Laymen, I have only this to say, that I am not the first that has plac'd a vicious Clergyman in the Infernal Territories; for <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> the Famous <HI>Roman</HI> Painter, in his Resurrection in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Chapel, had the presumption to paint a Cardinal in Hell, so very like the grave Father he represented, that every body knew the Picture, which put the good Old Gentle∣man under so great a Dissatisfaction, that he complain'd to the Pope, and desir'd he would Command it should be rub'd out; who told him, he was got quite out of his Jurisdiction, saying, If he had been but a step on this side, he could have released him from Purgatory, but having not the Keys of Hell, from thence there could be no Redemption.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
The next part of my Apology, is to the Learned Professors both of Law and Physick, for whom (as well as the Orthodox Clergy of the <HI>English</HI> Church) I have a peculiar Veneration, who cannot be insensible what swarms of hungry and unskilful Practicers in both Sciences there are, who fraudulently prey upon the honest Labours of the Publick, at such only is this Satyr pointed, who support themselves basely by others Ruin, and have no just Prospect, for want of true Knowledge in their Business, to preserve themselves from Beggary, but by often bringing others into it; one side plunging their Clients further into Trouble, in∣stead of helping them out; and the other, instead of recovering their Patients of Curable Distempers, will, if they be Poor, thro' neglect; or if Rich, by delays of Cure, for Interest sake, be the Death of some, and the undoing of others, to their whole Lives Misery. Therefore, since it as essentially relates to the Comforts of the Life of Man, to know what other People are, as well as what he himself should be, I thought it no Ill Task to Communicate to the World what knowledge of Mankind I have gather'd from my own Experience; the Good wont hurt us, 'tis the Bad we must be Cautious how we deal with; for which reason, I have herein separated the Wicked from the Godly, representing only the former, to show Youth what Monsters in Humane Shape they must expect to meet with in this World, tho' of the most Noble Professions: Therefore, my whole De∣sign is only to make Men careful with what <HI>Priests</HI> they trust their Souls; with what <HI>Lawyers</HI> their Estates; and with what <HI>Phy∣sicians</HI> their Bodies. And if this Part of my Undertaking suc∣ceed well, and that the World is pleased with it, they shall hear further from me on the same Subject; for in this I had not room to half finish my Design. <HI>So Farewel.</HI></P>

<LG>
<L>WHEN <HI>Western</HI> Clouds involv'd the God of Light,</L>
<L>And all the <HI>Eastern</HI> starry Orbs look'd bright;</L>
<L>When Sots their Tavern Bacchanals begun,</L>
<L>And <HI>Thetis</HI> at a draught drank up the Sun;</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Luna</HI> with her Silver Horns drew near,</L>
<L>To bless the Night, and bear Dominion here.</L>
<L>'Twas then that I, my better self, my Soul</L>
<L>Broke loose, and thro' my Prison Casements stole,</L>
<L>And glad I'd shifted off my Earthly Chains,</L>
<L>Danc'd like a flaming Vapour round the Plains.</L>
<L>I then thro' Brakes and over Whirl-Pools flew,</L>
<L>Till tir'd with only superficial view;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Then into Holes and Crannies did I dive,</L>
<L>Where Badger, Fox, and sundry Vermine live;</L>
<L>Where Moles were labouring to enlarge their Homes</L>
<L>And buzzing Bees made Musick o'er their Combs.</L>
<L>Farther I darted thro' the porous Earth,</L>
<L>To seek that Womb whence Nature had her Birth,</L>
<L>But found the hidden Mistery far too great,</L>
<L>And for a Human Soul too intricate:</L>
<L>Causes with sundry Causes mix'd I found,</L>
<L>Each Matrix did with proper Seeds abound,</L>
<L>But why those Seeds their likeness shou'd produce,</L>
<L>Their Form preserve, be still the same in use,</L>
<L>My shallow Reason neither see or knew,</L>
<L>But found each Cause did the Decrees pursue,</L>
<L>Of some Eternal Pow'r beyond dim Reasons view.</L>
<L>Thro' deeper Caverns still I forc'd my way,</L>
<L>Where useless Dregs of the old Chaos lay,</L>
<L>Involv'd in Night, remote, and never seen by Day.</L>
<L>Where Plagues and Pestilential Fumes were pent,</L>
<L>Till Heav'ns Decree shou'd give 'em fatal vent:</L>
<L>Where greater Serpents do the less devour,</L>
<L>And Human-like, contend for Sov'reign Pow'r:</L>
<L>Where Streams thro' subteranean Channels run,</L>
<L>And fight with Winds far distant from the Sun;</L>
<L>Whose violent Shocks the World can scarce survive,</L>
<L>But trembles at the very strokes they give.</L>
<L>And where Heavens Judgments in subjection lay,</L>
<L>Ready the dreadful Trumpet to Obey,</L>
<L>And work the World's destruction at the last sad Day.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4"/>
Thus thro' Nights deep Avenues did I pass,</L>
<L>Where all was rude as in the unform'd Mass.</L>
<L>Thro' Death's remoter frightful Vaults I went,</L>
<L>Where ghastly Sprights their Follies past lament,</L>
<L>And in dispairing Sighs such Discord make,</L>
<L>No Soul could hear, but of their Grief partake,</L>
<L>Dreading from thence their sad remove each Hour,</L>
<L>To endless Pains, where Time shall be no more.</L>
<L>So the poor Thief, when seiz'd for his Offence,</L>
<L>Finds his own Conscience Judge and Evidence.</L>
<L>And thus, before he to the Bar shall come,</L>
<L>Dreads with sad Terror his succeeding Doom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I forward press'd, bemoaning of their Case,</L>
<L>Freed from my Earth, Death ask'd me for no Pass,</L>
<L>But boldly shot the Adamantine Gates</L>
<L>Without repulse, unquestion'd by the Fates,</L>
<L>Who busie sate, with Distaff, Reel, and Knife,</L>
<L>Spining and cutting Man's short Threads of Life.</L>
<L>O'er scorching Sands, where fiery Seeds lay hid,</L>
<L>I Travell'd, till the <HI>Avernuan</HI> Hills I spy'd,</L>
<L>High were their gloomy Heads, the trodden Path as wide,</L>
<L>I ventur'd forwards, till to <HI>Styx</HI> I came,</L>
<L>Which shone like humid Vapours in a flame;</L>
<L>Its poysonous Fumes so fatal and impure,</L>
<L>None but Immortal Spirits can endure.</L>
<L>I stood a while, and ponder'd by the Lake</L>
<L>Upon the frightful Voyage I had still to take.</L>

<HEAD>CANTO II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>My Resolutions now much stronger grew,</L>
<L>My first Intentions to at last pursue,</L>
<L><HI>Charon</HI> I call'd, his leaky Boat to Freight,</L>
<L>Who in's infernal Pinnace nodding sate:</L>
<L>Hearing a Voice he started, and with speed,</L>
<L>He drag'd his rotten Bark from Mud and Weed:</L>
<L>With painful pulls he brought her to the Shore,</L>
<L>Black with the Guilt of those he'd wafted o'er.</L>
<L>The grisly Churl ask'd whither I wou'd go,</L>
<L>Up to <HI>Elizium,</HI> or the Shades below.</L>
<L>I told him I to <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Court was bound,</L>
<L>Where restless Souls amid'st their Pains are found.</L>
<L>The frowning Pilot finding me alone,</L>
<L>E'en bid me wait, for he'd not carry One.</L>
<L>'Twas I, said he, this Ferry first began,</L>
<L>And held it ever since the Fall of Man,</L>
<L>But never yet, as <HI>Pluto</HI> knows full well,</L>
<L>E'er wafted o'er one single Soul to Hell.</L>
<L>On Earth of what Imployment coud'st thou be,</L>
<L>Who com'st so destitute of Company:</L>
<L>Hard was thy Fate, to these dark Shades unknown,</L>
<L>Thou art the first that e'er was Damn'd alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I heard his Questions, but no Answer made,</L>
<L>And what he further ask'd did still evade,</L>
<L>With humble Words, that with him might prevail,</L>
<L>To take his Fare on board and set up Sail.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="5"/>
But all my soft Perswasions would not make,</L>
<L>The grim Tarpaulin his old Custom break,</L>
<L>Who gently row'd his Ferry to and fro,</L>
<L>Bauling aloud, <HI>Hey, downward, downward ho.</HI></L>
<L>Thus for more Company being forc'd to wait,</L>
<L>Down on the Bank, amongst the Weeds, I sat,</L>
<L>And looking round me, at a distance saw,</L>
<L>A loit'ring Crowd towards <HI>Charon</HI>'s Ferry draw:</L>
<L>They gently crept along, oft seem'd to stay,</L>
<L>And hung their Arses as if bound my way:</L>
<L>So the Wretch, drove to suffer for his Crime,</L>
<L>Now steps, then stops, to lengthen out the Time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Charon</HI> look'd out, the multitude drew nigh,</L>
<L>P—on'em, says the Churl, this sooty fry</L>
<L>Are Lawyers Souls, I know them by their dye.</L>
<L>Close to the <HI>Stygian</HI> Banks at last they came,</L>
<L>Showing some signs of Sorrow, some of Shame:</L>
<L>Despair and Anguish in their Looks I read,</L>
<L>Each did his sultry unknown Voyage dread;</L>
<L>And, Transport like, as gladly would be drown'd,</L>
<L>As see the slavish Shore to which they're bound.</L>
<L><HI>Charon</HI> pull'd near, but grumbl'd in the Throat,</L>
<L>Your pondrous Ills will never let me float,</L>
<L>You always come in Crowds, enough to sink my Boat:</L>
<L>If Hell in such mean Traffick means to Trade,</L>
<L><HI>Pluto</HI> must get a stronger Vessel made:</L>
<L>But come, step in, and do not make me stay,</L>
<L>Pray trim the Boat, whilst I my Stretcher lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<L>Then in we hobbl'd from a steep Descent,</L>
<L>Hoisted up Sail, and on our way we went;</L>
<L>Whilst I, not under the Decrees of Fate,</L>
<L>Amongst the sighing Crew with Pleasure sate,</L>
<L>Bearing some glim'rings of celestial Light,</L>
<L>With them compar'd, look'd innocent and bright,</L>
<L>As the tan'd Mariner 'mongst Negro Slaves looks white.</L>
<L>My Soul was light, and they so weighty were,</L>
<L>We held no poize, made <HI>Charon</HI> curse his Fare.</L>
<L>Who pull'd and puff'd, still roar'd with open Throat,</L>
<L>W—nds move your Shades, and better trim the Boat,</L>
<L>The Larboard Gunhil's almost under Water,</L>
<L>For me, the Devil waft such Fares hereafter.</L>
<L>My Soul considering her diviner Air,</L>
<L>No ballance with their heavy Crimes could bear,</L>
<L>Stept from the side, and in the center got,</L>
<L>And to the Churls content I trim'd the Boat,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Charon</HI> skull'd a head with mighty pains,</L>
<L>Deep Laden as a Western Barge from <HI>Stains.</HI></L>
<L>Downwards our Course, and as more way we made,</L>
<L>The Rocky Beach still loftier rais'd its Head;</L>
<L>Whose thistly Product all look'd parch'd and dry,</L>
<L>Like Weeds long ho'd that in the Sun-shine lye.</L>
<L>Vapours condens'd hung low'ring o'er each Head,</L>
<L>And sporting Daemons round the Vessel play'd.</L>
<L>Night-Ravens, Bats, and Screech-Owls then drew near,</L>
<L>To give old <HI>Charon,</HI> as he pass'd, a chear;</L>
<L>Who with their horrid Skrieks alarm'd each frighted Ear,</L>
<L>Mix'd with the Groans of filthy Souls from Stews,</L>
<L>Condemn'd to Fetters in the stinking Owse.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="6"/>
Thus the black Judge such Punishment contrives</L>
<L>As bears proportion to their odious Lives.</L>
<L>Serpents, like River-fish, their freaks would take,</L>
<L>And skip above the surface of the Lake;</L>
<L>Where Furies came from their more curs'd abodes,</L>
<L>To catch and bundle up their snaky Rods.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Charon</HI> now tir'd, his labouring Oar forsook,</L>
<L>A dram of some infernal Spirits took,</L>
<L>And 'twixt his Jaws a Pipe of flaming Sulphur stuck;</L>
<L>Then to his Oars himself again apply'd,</L>
<L>And to his Fare the merry Slave thus cry'd,</L>
<L>Chear up, ye sullen Shades, and be not dull;</L>
<L>(Then, adding strength, he gave a strenuous pull;)</L>
<L>You who'n the upper World, in long delays</L>
<L>Of Justice, and in Quarrels spend your Days,</L>
<L>Hold up your drooping Heads, more Courage show,</L>
<L>Than fear th'immortal Discords here below.</L>
<L>You that have pass'd the Adamantine Gates,</L>
<L>Grim King of Terrors, and the moody Fates,</L>
<L>Shake off your cowardly Fears, and with a Grace</L>
<L>Look the stern Prince of Darkness in the Face.</L>
<L>They shook their Ears, and signs of Horror show'd,</L>
<L>Great their Despair, and great their sinful load:</L>
<L>Their guilty Forms no Comfort cou'd receive,</L>
<L>Or could they one defensive Answer give,</L>
<L>But hung their thoughtful Heads, look'd <HI>Al-a-mort,</HI></L>
<L>Like sullen Convicts in a <HI>Tyburn-</HI>Cart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>
<L>By this time to a narrow Gulph we came,</L>
<L>The Lake descending in a rapid Stream;</L>
<L>Darkness all round above our Heads were set,</L>
<L>Lock'd in with Mountains in conjunction met;</L>
<L>Where clacks of Whips, and distant Yells were heard,</L>
<L>But nothing seen, Night only here appear'd.</L>
<L>This Current brought us to the deep Abyss,</L>
<L>Unknown to Light, to Harmony, and Peace,</L>
<L>Where Souls the painful Stings of Conscience bear,</L>
<L>And nothing dwells but Horror and Despair.</L>
<L>B'ing come to th'brink of the Infernal Cell,</L>
<L>Our Pilot steering to the Wharf of Hell,</L>
<L>Landed his Fare, and bid us all farewell.</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus put on Shore upon the dismal Strand,</L>
<L>Where fiery Attoms sparkled from the Sand;</L>
<L>Sighing my Comrades stood, and made their moan,</L>
<L>Like Seamen Shipwreck'd on a Coast unknown,</L>
<L>Whilst I unforc'd had little cause to mourn,</L>
<L>But was commission'd safely to return.</L>
<L>Time prun'd his Wings, and hasten'd on with speed,</L>
<L>The dreadful Moment that the Gods decreed,</L>
<L>The drooping Wretches should their entrance make,</L>
<L>At Hell's wide Porch that guards the burning Lake.</L>
<L>Compell'd by the extrinsick power of Fate,</L>
<L>The trembling Souls gave notice at the Gate,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="7"/>
Dreading those Torments which the Ills they'd done</L>
<L>Deserv'd, and was not in their power to shun.</L>
<L><HI>Cerberus</HI> growl'd, his Three-tone Snarl we heard,</L>
<L>The Chain he rattled, and the Gate unbar'd.</L>
<L>To <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Court we thus admitted were,</L>
<L>Dusky his Mansions, sultry hot the Air:</L>
<L>The Door shut after's with a frightful Clap,</L>
<L>From those sad Confines could be no escape:</L>
<L>Fetters and Links did at a distance clink;</L>
<L>Sad Howls we heard, and nothing smelt but Stink;</L>
<L>Nauseous as are the Fumes of smoth'ring Straw,</L>
<L>Great heat we felt, and gloomy Fires we saw,</L>
<L>Glowing like burning Piles of Turf or Peat,</L>
<L>Whilst groaning Souls lay basking in the Heat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My sad Companions were receiv'd by throngs</L>
<L>Of envious Spirits, arm'd with fiery Prongs,</L>
<L>Who clap'd their pointed Wings, and with a Yell,</L>
<L>Gave'em a dreadful Welcome into Hell,</L>
<L>And led'em Captive to a loathsome Cell;</L>
<L>Whilst I some Rays of Innocence diffus'd,</L>
<L>Unquestion'd pass'd, by all the Guards excus'd:</L>
<L>As he that visits <HI>Bridewell,</HI> with intent</L>
<L>To Goodness learn from others Punishment,</L>
<L>Does fearless thro' the Prison confines rove,</L>
<L>Whilst guilty Slaves are to Correction drove.</L>
<L>Vast streams of melted Minerals ran down,</L>
<L>'Twixt glowing Banks of Adamantine Stone,</L>
<L>Roaring like Cataracts on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>Flowing with violence, like an eager Tide:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="8"/>
Where Souls unpity'd are condemn'd to dwell,</L>
<L>Whilst Heav'ns without controul, or Hell is Hell.</L>
<L>They Plow'd the Fiery Surges to get free,</L>
<L>But sunk again, like Monsters in the Sea,</L>
<L>Or as the Poor on Earth, bore down by Destiny.</L>
<L>Near these were punish'd in Ignifluous Vaults,</L>
<L>The greatest Spirits for the biggest Faults:</L>
<L>Where I with pity and amazement view'd,</L>
<L>Princes of old, once stil'd so Great and Good,</L>
<L>Held so Immaculate, so all Divine,</L>
<L>That Gods could scarce with greater Glories shine;</L>
<L>High in the State, Victorious in the Field,</L>
<L>Abroad had Conquer'd, and at Home had Kill'd;</L>
<L>Wise in their Conduct, and approv'd their Cause,</L>
<L>Mighty in Pow'r, and equal in Applause:</L>
<L>Flatter'd on Earth by Poets and by Priests,</L>
<L>Yet doom'd at last to be Infernal Guests:</L>
<L>How much, thought I, do we mistake above,</L>
<L>Who esteem Pow'r a mark of Heaven's Love:</L>
<L>When thus I saw their grand Fatigues on Earth,</L>
<L>Their Noble Spirits and Illustrious Birth,</L>
<L>Their glorious Blood-shed in the wreaking Field,</L>
<L>For Crowns, or to enlarge Dominion spill'd.</L>
<L>Resistless Arms, and Arbitrary sway,</L>
<L>That forces ravish'd Countries to Obey.</L>
<L>Their dangerous Battels which they once might boast,</L>
<L>Crown'd with Success, by no Ill-fortune crost,</L>

<L>Small-Beer, Skim-Milk, and such like things as these,</L>

<L><PB N="18" REF="10"/>
Whilst they Carous'd, and did on Dainties Dine,</L>
<L>Squeesing each Bigots Cupboard, and his Vine,</L>

<L>And when they'd rais'd their Lust by luscious Food,</L>

</LG>

<L>As walking in the upper World one Day,</L>

<L>More to amuse, than to instruct the Crowd.</L>
<L>When all their thoughtless Nonsence spoke beside,</L>
<L>If by the touch of common Reason try'd,</L>
<L>Was something that just nothing signify'd,</L>
<L>The Doctrine of Forgiveness would they give;</L>
<L>But injur'd once, revenge it whilst they live:</L>

<L>Where Justice is too oft so dearly bought,</L>
<L>The Wrong's most cheap where Justice ne'er is sought.</L>
<L>These are the Ills for which they're hither sent,</L>

<L>These were succeeded by the Clerks o'th'Court,</L>
<L>The lesser Scribes, that do the greater hurt,</L>
<L>Whose woful earnest of a Ten Groats Fee,</L>
<L>Enters the Client first in Miserie:</L>
<L>Of these some Beaus, and some precise in Bands,</L>
<L>With Parchment Rowls, like Truncheons in their Hands;</L>
<L>Their Pockets stuff'd with Scrawls, like Poet Bays,</L>

<L>Under their Arms green Woollen Snap-sacks hung,</L>
<L>Fill'd with learn'd Instruments of Right and Wrong.</L>
<L>There follow'd next to these a spurious sort</L>
<L>Of Pettyfogers, meer Locusts of the Court,</L>
<L>Who often help the former to deceive,</L>
<L>And eat up what the bigger Vermin leave.</L>
<L>Some by their Shop-board Looks were Taylors bred,</L>

Vers'd in those Querks, amongst the Scribes they saw,</L>
<L>After long Troubles did themselves withdraw,</L>
<L>From making Sutes of Cloaths, to manage Suits of Law:</L>
<L>Well knowing it requires an equal Skill,</L>
<L>To make a Lawyer's, or a Taylor's Bill.</L>
<L>Amongst this paltry Crew, were Ten to One</L>
<L>Bred up to Trades, but by the Law undone:</L>

<L>Some in Freeze-Coats, strait Wiggs, and flapping Hats,</L>
<L>Great Beards, and dirty Hands, like Counter Rats,</L>
<L>With Looks undaunted, at their Heels a Straw,</L>
<L>Bold Teasers and Tormenters in the Law:</L>

<L>Round the Infernal Court they all were haul'd,</L>
<L>The first Division to the Bar were call'd;</L>
<L>The Charge brought down from the High Court of <HI>Jove</HI></L>
<L>Of which they'd all Convicted been above:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="13"/>
Silence was first proclaim'd in the Divan,</L>
<L>And Hell's Attorney-General thus began:</L>
<L>My Lord, the Grave, Wise Culprits at the Bar,</L>
<L>Who rais'd amongst Mankind perpetual War;</L>
<L>By some call'd Lawyers, and by some Be-knav'd,</L>
<L>Who by sly Querks the Upper-World enslav'd;</L>
<L>Subtle as Foxes, who with Tongues, not Claws,</L>
<L>Dug themselves Holes, and burrow'd in the Laws;</L>
<L>Skill'd to unravel Justice, but instead,</L>
<L>A hundred Wrongs to one just Act they did;</L>
<L>Till by ill use so mercenary grown,</L>
<L>They valu'd no Man's welfare but their own:</L>
<L>By study'd means would tedious Suits create,</L>
<L>And spin each Contest to a long Debate;</L>
<L>For other Persons plead, but get themselves the Estate.</L>
<L>Justice behind so many Querks they've put,</L>
<L>None but the long full Purse can find her out.</L>
<L>In vain by Thousands has she oft been sought,</L>
<L>But seldom found but when too dearly bought.</L>
<L>These her dark Agents, to their Country's shame,</L>
<L>Gilded their Frauds and Knaveries with her Name,</L>
<L>But seldom would regard the hoodwink'd heavenly Dame.</L>
<L>Biass'd by Briberies to the strongest side,</L>
<L>Rich Men were serv'd, when Paupers were deny'd:</L>
<L>For golden Fees, each sold his silver Tongue;</L>
<L>The Money'd Cause was right, if starv'd, 'twas wrong.</L>
<L>The Poor thus slighted, seldom could prevail;</L>
<L>Large Fees the Pleader turn'd, and he the Scale,</L>
<L>From him to whom the Ballance should encline</L>
<L>By right, but perishes for want of Coin.</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="13"/>
Contentious Suits and Quarrels they began,</L>
<L>Oft to th'undoing of the Just Good Man,</L>
<L>By wilful Flaws in Deeds, they might avoid:</L>
<L>Thus err'd with Pens, their Tongues might be imploy'd,</L>
<L>Till the poor Suff'rers Bags had largely paid,</L>
<L>For mending Faults their knavish Lawyers made.</L>
<L>If the Rich Miser ask'd their sage Advice</L>
<L>In a bad Case, they'd only say 'twas Nice:</L>
<L>But if their Client to the dregs was drawn,</L>
<L>And had no Money, or Estate to Pawn,</L>
<L>Tho' good his Cause, 'twas bad, not worth the carrying on.</L>
<L>So the Youth, poyson'd with a Harlot's Eye,</L>
<L>Is Hug'd and Flatter'd till she sucks him dry;</L>
<L>But when she's Jilted him of all she cou'd,</L>
<L>Foh! his Breath stinks, and all his Talk is rude.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th'Infernal Orator now paus'd a space,</L>
<L>He hauk'd and spit, blow'd Nose, and wip'd his Face:</L>
<L>B'ing thus refresh'd, he turn'd his sawcer Eyes,</L>
<L>And to Attorneys thus himself applies,</L>
<L>You who in Times of old did Ink-horns wear</L>
<L>In Leathern Zones, and Pens in twisted Hair;</L>
<L>Whose Locks were Comb'd as lank, and cut as short,</L>
<L>As best should seem the pleasure of the Court.</L>
<L>Who now on Earth as num'rously abound,</L>
<L>As Rooks and Magpies in a new sown Ground:</L>
<L>These by foul Practice and Extortion thriv'd,</L>
<L>And beggar'd half the Country where they liv'd;</L>
<L>Reviv'd old Discords, kindl'd up new Flame,</L>
<L>And sow'd Contention wheresoe'er they came,</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="14"/>
To pick the Purse of each laborious Slave,</L>
<L>Who Thrashes hard to feed the greedy Knave,</L>
<L>Buoy'd up with hopes he shall Victorious be;</L>
<L>He sweats and toils a Week to earn a Fee,</L>
<L>Then to next Market rides before his Dame,</L>
<L>And to his Scribe presents, with scraping Leg, the same;</L>
<L>Who bids the Booby Client chear his Heart,</L>
<L>And haughtily does bad Advice impart,</L>
<L>Fear not, says he, I'll make the Rascal smart;</L>
<L>But when his Purse has yielded up its Store,</L>
<L>His Cause proves bad, if he can bleed no more:</L>
<L>You told me wrong, did several things misplace,</L>
<L>Agree, agree, it proves an ugly Case.</L>
<L>Thus by long Bills stuff'd with unlawful Fees,</L>
<L>They tax'd the Farmer as themselves should please:</L>
<L>Improv'd litigious Suits by ill Advice,</L>
<L>Eat up full Barns and Acres in a trice,</L>
<L>And plagu'd the sinful Land like <HI>Egypt</HI>'s Frogs and Lice.</L>
<L>As they from Leathern Belt to Sword arose,</L>
<L>And from a rural Grey to Town-made Cloaths,</L>
<L>The greater value on their Pains they laid,</L>
<L>The more impos'd, the Client still obey'd,</L>
<L>And scrap'd and bow'd more low at ev'ry word he said.</L>
<L>These were the Locust first from Envy bred,</L>
<L>Who like the Drone, on others Labours fed;</L>
<L>And such insatiate Appetites they shew,</L>
<L>As still devour'd, and still more hungry grew.</L>
<L>So the lean Miser that improves his Store,</L>
<L>Becomes more close and greedy than before,</L>
<L>And as he grows more Rich, the more he grinds the Poor.</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="14"/>
This said, the pensive Scribes were all set by,</L>
<L>And to the Bar they call'd the lesser Fry,</L>
<L>Those worser Knaves, that Pestilential Throng,</L>
<L>Who in the Rear-Division march'd along,</L>
<L>The Court amaz'd to see so vile a Train,</L>
<L>The sable Pleader thus again began:</L>
<L>Of these, my Lord, but little need be said,</L>
<L>The worst of Rogues that Human Race e'er bred.</L>
<L>In Frauds and Cheats all others these excell,</L>
<L>A curse to Earth, and now a Shame to Hell.</L>

<L>These at no Crime or Villany would start,</L>
<L>But boast and glory in each roguish part,</L>
<L>Hell's sharpest Pains scarce equals their Desert.</L>
<L>Concluding thus, the Judge himself begins,</L>
<L>And pronounc'd Sentence in the following Lines:</L>

<L>To make a Man Immortal by a Squirt.</L>
<L>Some with two Talents were profusely blest,</L>
<L>And seem'd to study least, what they profest,</L>
<L>In earnest Poetry, and Physick but in jest.</L>
<L>One hop'd by Satyr he himself should raise</L>
<L>To the same Honour some had done by Praise,</L>
<L>But angry seem'd because he lost his Aim,</L>
<L>And did th' Ingratitude of Princes blame,</L>
<L>Who gave not that Reward he might in Justice claim.</L>
<L>As they mov'd forwards great Complaints they made</L>
<L>Against the crafty Pharmacentick Trade;</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="16" MS="y"/>
Bad were their Med'cines, and too great their Price,</L>
<L>Little their Care, and ign'rant their Advice;</L>
<L>Who from the Bills they fill'd had found a way</L>
<L>To seem as Wise, and be as Rich as they.</L>
<L>Ne'er fear, says one, a Project I'll advance</L>
<L>Shall bring them back to their first Ignorance.</L>
<L>The Means propos'd were neither wise, nor fair,</L>
<L>A frothy Thought that vanish'd into Air,</L>
<L>And left the wrinkled Consult in a deep despair.</L>
<L>Graduates and Emp'ricks here did well agree,</L>
<L>And kindly mix'd, like Gold and Mercury.</L>
<L>Both had their Bands, their Canes Japan'd with black,</L>
<L>Each in their Carriage had the same grave Knack,</L>
<L>'Twas hard to know the Doctor from the Quack.</L>
<L>Both skill'd to sift the Patients Worth, or Want,</L>
<L>And furnish'd were alike with Chamber-Cant:</L>
<L>Both could advance their Cane-heads to their Nose,</L>
<L>And bid the Nurse take off, or lay on Cloths;</L>
<L>Judge the sick Pulse, pursuant to the Rule,</L>
<L>And ask the Patient when he'd last a Stool:</L>
<L>Both talk'd alike, alike did understand,</L>
<L>Each had hard Words as Plenty at Command;</L>
<L>But that which some small distance had begot,</L>
<L>One knew from whence deriv'd, the other not.</L>
<L>The Emperick therefore in Dispute oft yields,</L>
<L>And gives the College D—ce the Mast'ry of <HI>Moorfields.</HI></L>
<L>Thus he that's Sick to either may address,</L>
<L>For both administer with like Success,</L>
<L>The Quack oft kills, the Doctor does no less.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="16"/>
Next these a Troop of Med'cine Mongers went</L>
<L>With Cordials in their Hands, they should not faint,</L>
<L>Who rail'd against the College Dons, and swore</L>
<L>Themselves as Wise as those that went before.</L>
<L>One much disturb'd his Brethren were opprest,</L>
<L>Attention begg'd, and thus he spoke his best:</L>
<L>Thro' Zeal to's Trade, he rashly did begin,</L>
<L>Speaking as if on Earth he still had been:</L>
<L>If to our Wrong, Physicians stoop so low,</L>
<L>To keep a Med'cine Warehouse, let'em know,</L>
<L>We'll practice Physick till we kill and slay</L>
<L>As many Thousands in a Year as they.</L>
<L>The Poor they promis'd should have Med'cines free,</L>
<L>Instead of that the Upper-World may see,</L>
<L>They make 'em pay great Rates for as bad Goods as we.</L>
<L>Therefore in just Revenge let's drive at all,</L>
<L>Advise, Bleed, Purge, and no Phisician call:</L>
<L>Thus into obstinate Resolves they broke,</L>
<L>And wisely, like Apothecaries, spoke,</L>
<L>We will do what we will, and let them see,</L>
<L>As long as we don't care, pray what care we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>St. <HI>Barth'lomew</HI>'s Physicians next came up,</L>
<L>Some bred <HI>Tom-Fools,</HI> and some to Dance the Rope:</L>
<L>One Month employ'd i'th' Business of the Fair,</L>
<L>And th' other Eleven stroling Doctors were.</L>
<L>Of Learning these no Portion had, or Sence,</L>
<L>Their only Gift was downright Impudence:</L>
<L>Chiefly in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> born,</L>
<L>But <HI>England</HI>'s Plague, and their own Country's Scorn.</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="17"/>
The Poor Fools Idol, and the Wiseman's Scoff;</L>
<L>Yet often cur'd what Learned Heads left off.</L>
<L>With these were Sow-Gelders, and Tooth-Drawers mixt,</L>
<L>And Barber-Surgeons here and there betwixt.</L>
<L>Some round their Necks had Chains and Medals got,</L>
<L>For Curing some strange Prince of God knows what:</L>
<L>Others who Bulls, and Bores, and Colts had Gelt,</L>
<L>Wore Silver Horse-shooes on a Scarlet Belt.</L>
<L>Whilst Spoon-Promoters with the rest came on,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with Sets of good sound Teeth they'd drawn.</L>
<L>Illit'rate all, from painful Study freed,</L>
<L>Scarce one could Write, and very few could read.</L>
<L>Themselves they extol'd, on others heaping Blame,</L>
<L>Their Bills and common Talk were much the same:</L>
<L>When e'er they spoke their barren Nonsence shew,</L>
<L>They little had to say, and less to do.</L>
<L>Some from the Loom, some from the Last arose,</L>
<L>Others from making or from mending Cloaths.</L>
<L>Pretending all such useful Truths they'd found</L>
<L>In Physick's Riddle, which but few expound,</L>
<L>That was most pleasant, speedy, safe and sure,</L>
<L>And in the twinkling of an Eye would Cure</L>
<L>The worst Disease on Earth, that Mortal cou'd endure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Close to the Bar they now began to Crowd,</L>
<L>Hoping for Mercy, very low they bow'd.</L>
<L>The Judge being tir'd, did for some Hours adjourn,</L>
<L>And left 'em there to wait the Court's Return.</L>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Have reason to suspect, from some Clamours I have heard against the Title of this <HI>Poem,</HI> upon the Publication of the <HI>First Part,</HI> that 'tis a very wicked Age we live in, since the very Name of <HI>Hell</HI> and the <HI>Devil</HI> are such wonderful Scare-crows to a parcel of Puritan∣nical Fornicators, which, if they had been oftner put in mind of his Infer∣nal Worship, and his dreadful Dominions, might have been a means, for ought I know, of frighting 'em from a Licentious and Wicked Life, into more Honesty and Vertue. Words in themselves are no more than Marks by which we signifie or express the Conceptions of our own Minds, or raise up Idea's of the same things we represent in others.</P>
<P>Therefore to put the World in mind of <HI>Hell</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> in a justifiable way, representing both as terrible as the narrowness of my Capacity would give me leave, I hope can be no Fault, since it is rea∣sonable enough to believe, the dread of eternal Punishment deters more People from an Ill Life, than the hopes of everlasting Happiness has in∣duc d to a Good one; for we may observe the weakness of Humane Na∣ture to be such, that the fear of Wracks and Tortures has often brought Offenders and Conspirators to a Confession of their Guilt and Plots, when the reward of Life would not tempt 'em to a Discovery; and almost every Man may find, who will but examine himself or observe others, that Prosperity in this World does not so much elevate a Man, as Adver∣sity depresses him; Pleasure does not so much affect us as Pain, which makes us more watchful to avoid the one, than industrious to obtain the other. I declare my Intention to be good, and those that look into the Design without Prejudice, must allow it to be so: But as for such kind of zealous Shop-Criticks, who are afraid to peep into the Book because they see the Devil in the Title-Page, I must needs tell 'em, it favours more of ridiculous Preciseness and Hypocricy, than it does of true Zeel or good Judgment, and I think they deserve as much to be laugh'd at for being angry with the Title upon that Account, as the Lady did for burning her Bed upon another, which affording something of a Jest, I'll proceed to the Story. In the Times of Confusion, when the Sword had cut down the Scepter, Purity knock'd down the Church, and a High Court of Justice had destroy'd both Law and Equity, there happen'd then to be a very Devout Lady, who number'd her self amongst the prevailing
<PB REF="20"/>
Saints, and would not suffer any thing that had been polluted to har∣bour under her Roof; the more to strengthen her in her Religious Ex∣ercises and Heavenly Meditations, she kept a thumping lusty Precisian in her House, which she call'd her Chaplain, who was always wonderful busie in watching the Lambs of Grace in the Family, 'that they might not Err and Stray like lost Sheep; and at last happen'd, by his vigi∣lance, to discover a Man-Servant and a Maid-Servant upon a Bed to∣gether in very close Conjunction, and running presently to the Good Lady, brought her to the Key-hole of the Door to be an Eye-witness of the Matter, who seeing such an abomination committed in her House, call'd out to 'em with all impatience to open the Door, and for a Cou∣ple of unsanctified Wretches to depart her House, which she fear'd would fall under some heavy Judgment for so vile a Transgression; their bu∣siness being done, in Obedience to their Lady's Commands, they drew the Bolt, and the enrag'd good Gentlewoman, with the assistance of her Holy Servant, turn'd 'em out into the Street, by Head and Shoulders, which being done, they consulted together how they should punish the defiled Bed, for assisting them in their Wickedness, at last concluded it should be burnt, which was done accordingly; who should come by, when the sinful Utensils were in Flames, but the Fellow who had been the Transgressor, and being inform'd what the Fire was made on, <HI>Egad,</HI> says he, <HI>they might as well have burnt all the Beds in the House, and most of the Chairs to boot; for there are none of the one, and very few of the other, but what, to my Know∣ledge, have been privy to the same business.</HI></P>
<P>I only give this Story as an Instance of the unaccountable Folly and blindness of some Folks Zeal; for if every Bed was to be burnt that has been thus polluted, and every Book to be supprest that has <HI>Hell</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Name in it, our Libraries would be very thin, and our Houses but indifferently Furnish'd; besides, as to the latter, the drift of the whole <HI>Poem</HI> being to detect and scourge the Frauds and Wick∣edness of Men. I say, they may as well Censure most Sermons preach'd, in the Nation, wherein the same Bugbear Words are us'd with a good Intention: But however, because such Persons should not be Offended, I have, in this Part, put <HI>Hell</HI> with a dash, and supplied the place of <HI>the Devil</HI> with an <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Method, to please 'em, I shall continue in all the succeeding Parts, which (God willing) I intend to carry on as long as the World shall give Encouragement.</P>
<P><HI>Farewel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Journey, &amp;c. PART II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="canto">
<LG>
<L>IN the Court's absence hot Disputes arose,</L>
<L>Betwixt the Doctors and their Dogst—d Foes;</L>
<L>No Blows they had, but every warm Debate</L>
<L>Did in abusive Language terminate;</L>
<L>Quack, Emp'rick, Clyster-giver, Fool, and Knave,</L>
<L>Close-stool-Promoter, Buttock-peeping Slave,</L>
<L>Physician's Vassal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Apotheca∣ries origi∣nally Ser∣vants to Physicians.</NOTE> kept at first to Trot</L>
<L>With Vomit, Vial, Purge, and Gally-Pot,</L>
<L>To pick our Drugs and Herbs, and what is worse,</L>
<L>To bear the Teaze of ev'ry tatt'ling Nurse;</L>
<L>Drudge to the Pestle and a Charcoal Fire,</L>
<L>Only maintain'd to save a Porter's Hire,</L>
<L>And now! to thus audaciously presume</L>
<L>To prescribe Physick in a Doctor's room,</L>
<L>When you no more of Theory understand,</L>
<L>Than Monsters in the Ocean do of Land:</L>
<L>Whence sprang this unaccountable advance,</L>
<L>But from base Impudence and Ignorance?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="21"/>
Whence can you boast your Knowledge, lest you own,</L>
<L>By study of your Files you're Learned grown?</L>
<L>And if you do, 'tis but a weak defence,</L>
<L>For none but Quacks from <HI>Recipes</HI> Commence:</L>
<L>If from Prescriptions you could once attain</L>
<L>To be a competent Physician,</L>
<L>Read <HI>Usher</HI>'s Sermons, where the Gospel shines,</L>
<L>And you as well may make your selves Divines:</L>
<L>How will ye find, by an old musty Bill,</L>
<L>New Patients Constitutions when they're Ill?</L>
<L>Or if unlearn'd in Physick's crabbed Laws,</L>
<L>How the Distemper judge, or guess the Cause?</L>
<L>No, your pretended Skill's a dangerous Cheat,</L>
<L>To bubble those who want both Health and Wit.</L>
<L>If an old File can such Instructions give,</L>
<L>As teach you how to make the Dying Live,</L>
<L>How far must we Excel, what Wonders do,</L>
<L>Who gave at first those <HI>Recipes</HI> to you!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Scourge made all the Crabs-Eye Crew run mad,</L>
<L>Who answer'd 'em in Language full as bad,</L>
<L>They hum'd and buz'd about like angry Bees,</L>
<L>And look'd as poys'nous as <HI>Cantharides,</HI></L>
<L>Vex'd at the two-edg'd Sayings of the Bard,</L>
<L>Thus they began, spoke loud, and wou'd be heard:</L>
<L>Cast on your selves but an impartial Eye,</L>
<L>Look round your ill-compos'd Society,</L>
<L>And you as empty Dunces there may find,</L>
<L>Quite deaf to Learning, and to Reason blind,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="21"/>
As e'er swept Shop, or did a Counter wipe,</L>
<L>Or ty'd a Bladder to a Clyster-Pipe:</L>
<L>Some <HI>Hogan Mogan</HI> Quacks, first Taylors bred,</L>
<L>And from the Shop-board were Physicians made,</L>
<L>By old Receits of others, not their own,</L>
<L>Grow famous Curers of the <HI>Gout</HI> or <HI>Stone:</HI></L>
<L>Why may not we Prescribe as well as these,</L>
<L>Who ne'er read <HI>Galen</HI> or <HI>Hippocrates,</HI></L>
<L>Or any part of Physick's System know,</L>
<L>Beyond what our <HI>Dispensatories</HI> show.</L>
<L>Others of <HI>Oxford</HI> may, or <HI>Cambridge</HI> boast,</L>
<L>Who had a Twelve-month's standing there at most,</L>
<L>Where what he learn'd at School he not improv'd, but lost,</L>
<L>Whose wand'ring Thoughts no Study could entice,</L>
<L>But is expell'd for Negligence or Vice.</L>
<L>And thus the Rake fall'n short of a Degree,</L>
<L>Chaplain or Curate he despairs to be,</L>
<L>At last Physician turns thro' meer Necessitie.</L>
<L>When thus resolv'd, he does to <HI>Holland</HI> go,</L>
<L>Where Quacks and Mountebanks like Mushromes grow,</L>
<L>Spring up as fast; a <HI>Recipe</HI>'s their rise,</L>
<L>And thus they're made Physicians in a trice.</L>
<L>But he more learn'd in School-Boy Rules repairs</L>
<L>To <HI>Leyden,</HI> where he's taught to stand the Bears,</L>
<L>There spends Six Months, and at a small expence,</L>
<L>Does two or three Degrees at once Commence:</L>
<L>Then Home he comes, and does admittance gain,</L>
<L>Amongst the grave old Bards in <HI>Warwick-Lane;</HI></L>
<L>Adorns his Copy'd Prescripts well as they,</L>
<L>With the learn'd Capitals, <HI>M. F. S. A.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="22"/>
A Pill made publick is his main support,</L>
<L>Which he takes care does neither good nor hurt,</L>
<L>Fam'd for som wond'rous Cure at som strang Prince'sCourt;</L>
<L>He's always hasty, trots a Coach-Horse pace,</L>
<L>And bears the Title (Doctor) with a Grace:</L>
<L>Furnish'd with Terms, he can the Patient pose,</L>
<L>And runs at all, tho' nothing truly knows;</L>
<L>Undertakes desp'rate Cures for weighty Summs,</L>
<L>Coz'ning the Patient wheresoe'er he comes;</L>
<L>Why may not we, to make up Med'cines bred,</L>
<L>The same Admin'ster, and as well succeed</L>
<L>As this unskilful interloping Crew,</L>
<L>Ign'rant of Physick, nay, and Med'cine too.</L>
<L>The Learn'd but make of both a common Jest,</L>
<L>A <HI>Leyden</HI> Quack, and <HI>Salamanca</HI> Priest:</L>
<L>Therefore—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Judge returning, ended the Dispute,</L>
<L>And with his awful Presence struck 'em Mute;</L>
<L>As wrangling Mob, together by the Ears,</L>
<L>Grow silent when the Constable appears.</L>
<L>Down in great Pomp the grave Assembly sits,</L>
<L>The Lamps grew dim, the Cryer call'd fresh Lights.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Orator his Papers spread,</L>
<L>And to the Court this short Oration made:</L>
<L>My Lord—</L>
<L>Within the Circle of a solar Year,</L>
<L>Such numbers of these Criminals appear</L>
<L>At this last Bar of Justice, that there needs</L>
<L>But short recital of their sinful Deeds;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="22"/>
A long <HI>Exordium</HI> therefore I'll forbear,</L>
<L>And just remind your Lordship what they are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These were the Enemies to Humane Good,</L>
<L>Who did the languishing Diseas'd delude,</L>
<L>With gilded Poysons to abuse their Blood;</L>
<L>And did to the mistaking World pretend</L>
<L>Man's Life from Fate, <HI>pro Tempore,</HI> to defend.</L>
<L>Instead of which, to one their Art could save,</L>
<L>They hasten'd Legions headlong to the Grave;</L>
<L>And by their Pills, so <HI>speedy, safe,</HI> and <HI>sure,</HI></L>
<L>Begot more Evils than their Art could Cure.</L>
<L>Some Fools and Tumblers, some Mechanicks bred,</L>
<L>Who quitted Needle, Last, or some such Trade,</L>
<L>To barb'rously encrease the numbers of the Dead.</L>
<L>When lustful Brutes were weary of their Wives,</L>
<L>And wanted younger Flesh to bless their Lives.</L>
<L>These were the Artists who by Med'cines force,</L>
<L>Gave, on good Terms, a Physical Divorce,</L>
<L>And often help'd, at reasonable Rates,</L>
<L>Impatient Heirs much sooner to Estates,</L>
<L>Well knowing whensoe'er they exert their Skill,</L>
<L>The rich old Dad, or homely Spouse to kill,</L>
<L>The Son or Husband ne'er disputes the Doctor's Bill.</L>
<L>If to a Patient call'd, to them unknown,</L>
<L>When first into the House or Room they're shown,</L>
<L>The mercenary Quack looks round to see</L>
<L>What signs of Want, or of Prosperity</L>
<L>Appear about the Chamber, and from thence</L>
<L>Does his Advice accordingly dispence:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="23"/>
If meanly Furnish'd, and course Sheets, they're Poor,</L>
<L>The Country Air must then perform the Cure;</L>
<L>But if the Patient's Rich, Lie still, dear Sir,</L>
<L>Nurse keep him close, 'tis present Death to stir,</L>
<L>I'll send a Drink shall rectifie his Blood,</L>
<L>Drenches and Drops can only do him good,</L>
<L>Pearl-Cordials, made of Crabs-Eyes, must be now his Food.</L>
<L>Thus is the Wretch with Physick stuff'd and cloy'd,</L>
<L>And what he begs for most, is most deny'd,</L>
<L>Till pin'd away at last to Skin and Bone,</L>
<L>Only for want of Food to live upon:</L>
<L>But when giv'n o'er, if Nature be but strong,</L>
<L>The Cook oft proves the Doctor in the wrong,</L>
<L>And does his Life with Kitchin Physick save,</L>
<L>Brought by base Emp'ricks once so near the Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hence, my Lord, it plainly does appear,</L>
<L>Such Doctors many Thousands in a Year,</L>
<L><HI>Secundum Artem,</HI> kill, for want of good small Beer.</L>
<L>Thus is the noblest Science most abus'd,</L>
<L>And Patients by unskilful Quacks misus'd.</L>
<L>These Mercenary Methods they pursu'd,</L>
<L>Regarding nothing but their own Self-Good.</L>
<L>What Pains to these inhumane Crimes are due,</L>
<L>My Lord, I humbly must submit to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Judge arose, his Countenance compos'd,</L>
<L>And to the Pris'ners thus his Mind disclos'd;</L>
<L>You who, pursuant to the God's Decree,</L>
<L>Are to receive your final Doom from me,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="23"/>
Your Crimes are great, which you your selves well know,</L>
<L>Expect no Mercy, for I none can show;</L>
<L>Since you with loathsome Slops have Crowds destroy'd,</L>
<L>Whilst you your selves good wholsome Food enjoy'd;</L>
<L>Kill'd on, without regard to dying Groans,</L>
<L>And fill'd Church-Yards with your own Skeletons,</L>
<L>To Pains I'll doom ye, yet to Hell unknown,</L>
<L>Proportion'd to the hainious Ills you've done:</L>
<L>Such pois'nous Drenches shall you always swill,</L>
<L>As more and more torment, but never kill:</L>
<L>Each odious Draught shall still encrease your Hate,</L>
<L>And gripe you worse than <HI>Asnick</HI> does a Rat.</L>
<L>As close as barrel'd Figs you shall be cram'd,</L>
<L>Without the hopes of being e'er undamn'd:</L>
<L>There Purge, Spue, Piss, Sweat, to the worst degree,</L>
<L>And stink together to Eternity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Doctors at their Sentence hawk'd and spit,</L>
<L>The Apothecaries puk'd with meer conceit,</L>
<L>And with sad sickly Looks did humbly pray</L>
<L>The Court, they might be damn'd the common way:</L>
<L>The Judge to their Request had no regard,</L>

Amongst 'em, here and there, a stanch'd old Wit,</L>
<L>Who long had stood the Censure of the Pit,</L>

<L>Some Madman's Rant, or some Fools barren Jest:</L>

<L>These are the Flatt'rers, who with fulsome Lies</L>
<L>Made Knaves seem honest, and rich Fools seem wise;</L>
<L>Misplac'd the Epithets, Great, Good, and Just,</L>
<L>Us'd them as Masks to cover Pride and Lust:</L>
<L>Virtues to each vain gilded Fop they gave,</L>
<L>Made Niggards Generous and Cowards Brave;</L>
<L>Found Charms and Graces for each homely She,</L>
<L>And highly prais'd each Jilt of Quality;</L>
<L>Made her all Beauty, Innocence Divine,</L>
<L>And like a Goddess in their Poems shine,</L>
<L>Who whilst they sung her Praise, in Fact was lewd,</L>
<L>And lawless Pleasures ev'ry Hour pursu'd;</L>
<L>If lib'ral of her Gold they'd give her Charms,</L>
<L>Thus sold their Praise as Heralds do their Arms.</L>

<L>The World they cheated into base Mistakes,</L>
<L>And gull'd 'em with a thousand Rhiming Knacks;</L>
<L>With Fancies, witty Flirts, and musing Dreams,</L>

<L>Their Works are all false Mirrors, where Men see</L>
<L>Not what they are, but what they cannot be:</L>
<L>Such lushious Flatt'ries flowing from each Pen,</L>

<L>So are the Prisoners at the Bar (my Lords)</L>
<L>A jingling Consort of deceitful Birds,</L>

<LG>
<L>Who sung about the World, like common Fame,</L>
<L>Hyperboles of Praise to each great Name,</L>
<L>And made those Actions Glorious which deserv'd but Shame</L>

<L>The lewd Great Man, that banter'd Holy Writ,</L>

<LG>
<L>Sublime his Notions, and refin'd his Thoughts,</L>

<L>The Patron of his Gold profusely free,</L>

<L>Tho' ne'er so vile, if th'Muses Friends they were,</L>

<LG>
<L>Make the best Creatures to their Lash submit,</L>
<L>Render each Virtuous She a Counterfeit,</L>
<L>And Stile the Pious Virgin but a Hipocrite.</L>

<L>The saving Man as Niggard they'll accuse,</L>
<L>The gen'rous Worthy they can call Profuse,</L>
<L>Thus all that's Good and Just, when e'er they please, abuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sober Student is a Bookish Dunce,</L>
<L>The Wit that's free spends too much Brains at once,</L>
<L>And he that's Brave or Bold, is but a Flash or Bounce.</L>
</LG>

<L>Religion, when they please, is but a Trick,</L>
<L>The Priests are Hounds that hunt a Bishoprick,</L>

<L>His Follies past, the Gainers in the end,</L>
<L>Would blame him most, and be the least his Friend.</L>
<L>Thus, says Hell's Pleader, I my Charge conclude,</L>
<L>And to your Lordship leave the Tipling Multitude.</L>
<L>The Judge sum'd up, in a short Speech, their Sins,</L>
<L>And then the Culprits Doom he thus begins.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Evils done above, from whence you came,</L>
<L>Infernal Fevers shall your Souls inflame;</L>
<L>Eternal Drowth upon your Tongues shall dwell,</L>
<L>And all be fetter'd near an empty Well;</L>
<L>Fine Rivers at a distance shall you see,</L>
<L>Burnt Brandy shall your only Liquor be,</L>
<L>And in this State remain to all Eternity.</L>
