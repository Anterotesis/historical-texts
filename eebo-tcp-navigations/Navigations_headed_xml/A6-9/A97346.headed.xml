<HEAD>TO THE GENERALL <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN publishing this Essay of my Poeme, there is this great disaduantage against me; that it commeth out at this time, when Verses are wholly deduc't to Chambers, and nothing esteem'd in this Iunatique Age, but what is kept in Cabinets, and must only passe by Transcription; In such a season, when the Idle Humerous world must heare of nothing, that either sauors of Antiquity, or may awake it to seeke after more, then dull and slothfull ignorance may easily reach vnto: These, I say, make much against me; and especially in a Poeme, from any example, either of Ancient, or Modern, that haue proued in this kind: whose vnusuall tract may perhaps seeme difficult, to the female Sex; yea, and I feare, to some that think theselues not meanly learned, being not rightly inspi∣red by the Muses: such I meane, as had rather read the fantasies of forraine in∣uentions, then to see the Rarities &amp; Historie of their owne Country deliuered by a true natiue Muse. Then, whosoeuer thou be, possest with such stupidity &amp; dul∣nesse, that, rather then thou wilt take paines to search into ancient and noble things, choosest to remaine in the thicke fogges and mists of ignorance, as neere the common Lay-stall of a Citie; refusing to walke forth into the <HI>Tempe</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Muses, where through most delightfull Groues the Angellique harmony of Birds shall steale thee to the top of an easie hill, where in artificiall caues, cut out of the most naturall Rock, thou shalt see the ancient people of this Ile deliuered thee in their liuely images: from whose height thou <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> behold both the old and later times, as in thy prospect, lying farrevnder thee; then con∣uaying thee downe by a soule-pleasing Descent through delicate embrodered Meadowes, often veined with gentle gliding Brooks; in which thou maist fully view the dainty Nymphes in their simple naked bewties, bathing them in Crystalline streames; which shall lead thee, to most pleasant Downes, where harmlesse Shepheards are, some exercising their pipes, some singing rounde∣laies, to their gazing flocks: If as, I say, thou hadst rather, (because it asks thy labour) remaine, where thou wert, then straine thy selfe to walke forth with the Muses; the fault proceeds from thy idlenesse, not from any want in my industrie. And to any that shall demand wherfore hauing promised this Poeme of the ge∣nerall Iland so many yeeres, I now publish only this part of it; I plainly answere, that many times I had determined with my selfe, to haue left it off, and haue neglected my papers sometimes two yeeres to gether, finding the times since his Maiesties happy comming in, to fall so heauily vpon my distressed fortunes, after my zealous soule had labored so long in that, which with the general happi∣nesse of the kingdom, seem'd not then impossible somewhat also to haue aduan∣ced me. But I instantly saw all my long nourisht hopes euen buried aliue before my face: so vncertaine (in this world) be the ends of our cleerest endeuors. And what euer is herein that tastes of a free spirit, I thankfully confesse it to proceed frō the continuall bounty of my truly Noble friend Sir <HI>Walter Aston;</HI> which hath
<PB REF="6"/>
giuen me the best of those howres, whose leasure hath effected this which I now publish. Sundry other Songs I haue also, though yet not so perfect that I dare cō∣mit them to publique censure; and the rest I determine to go forward with, God enabling me, may I find means to assist my endeuour. Now Reader, for the fur∣ther vnderstanding of my Poeme, thou hast three especiall helps; First the Ar∣gument to direct thee still, where thou art, and through what Shires the Muse makes her iourney, and what she chiefly handles in the Song thereto belonging. Next, the Map, liuely delineating to thee, euery Mountaine, Forrest, Riuer, and Valley; expressing in their sundry postures; their loues, delights, and naturall si∣tuations. Then hast thou the illustration of this learned Gentleman, my friend, to explaine euery hard matter of history, that, lying farre from the way of com∣mon reading, may (without question) seem difficult vnto thee. Thus wishing thee thy hearts desire, and committing my Poeme to thy charitable censure, I take my leaue.</P>

<HEAD>From the Author OF The <HI>Illustrations.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PErmit mee thus much of these Notes to My Friend. What the Verse oft, with allusion, as supposing a full knowing Reader, lets slip; or in winding steps of Personating Fictions (as some times) so infolds, that suddaine conceipt cannot abstract a Forme of the clothed Truth, I haue, as I might, <HI>Illustrated. Breuity,</HI> and <HI>Plainenes</HI> (as the one endur'd the Other) I haue ioyned; purposely auoyding frequent commixture of different language; and, whensoeuer it hap∣pens, eyther the Page or Margine (specially for <HI>Gentlewomens</HI> sake) summarily interprets it, except where Interpretation aides not. Be∣ing not very Prodigall of my Historicall Faith, after <HI>Explanation,</HI> I oft aduenture on <HI>Examination,</HI> and <HI>Censure.</HI> The Author, in Pas∣sages of <HI>first Inhabitants, Name, State,</HI> and <HI>Monarchique succession</HI> in this Isle, followes <HI>Geffrey ap Arthur, Polychronicon, Matthew</HI> of <HI>West minster,</HI> and such more. Of their Traditions, for that one so much controuerted, and by <HI>Cambro-Britons</HI> still maintayned, tou∣ching the <HI>Troian Brute,</HI> I haue (but as an Aduocat for the Muse) argued; disclaiming in it, if alledg'd for my own Opinion. In most of the rest, vpon weighing the Reporters credit, Comparison with more perswading authority, and <HI>Synchronisme</HI> (the best Touch-stone in this kind of Triall) I leaue note of Suspicion, or adde coniecturall Amendment: as, for particular examples, among other, in <HI>Brennus</HI> mistooke by all Writers of later time, sollowing <HI>Iustins</HI> Epitome of <HI>Trogus</HI> ill conceiu'd; in <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Swaphams</HI> Story of K. <HI>Wulphers</HI> murdring his Children; in <HI>Rollo</HI> first D. of <HI>Normandy</HI> his time; none of them yet rectified (although the first hath been aduentu∣red on) by any that I haue seene; and such more. And indeed my Iealousie hath oft vext me with particular inquisition of whatsoe∣uer occurrs, bearing not a marke of most apparant Truth, euer since I found so intollerable Antichronismes, incredible reports, and <HI>Bar∣dish</HI> impostures, as well from Ignorance as assum'd liberty of Inuen∣tion in some of our Ancients; and red also such palpable Fauxeties, of our Nation, thrust into the World by Later Time: as (to giue a tast) that of <HI>Randall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> affirming the Beginning of <HI>Wards</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Hen.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Polydores</HI> assertion (vpon mistaking of the Statute of I.

<HEAD>THE ARGVMENT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> striue, in this Song,</L>
<L>To whether, <HI>Lundy</HI> doth belong:</L>
<L>When eithers Nymphs, to cleere the doubt,</L>
<L>By Musick meane to try it out.</L>
<L>Of mightie <HI>Neptune</HI> leaue they aske:</L>
<L>Each one betakes her to her taske;</L>
<L>The <HI>Britaines,</HI> with the Harpe and Crowd:</L>
<L>The <HI>English,</HI> both with still and loud.</L>
<L>The <HI>Britaines</HI> chaunt King <HI>Arthurs</HI> glory:</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> sing their <HI>Saxons</HI> storie.</L>
<L>The Hills of <HI>Wales</HI> their weapons take,</L>
<L>And are an vprore like to make,</L>
<L>To keepe the <HI>English</HI> part in awe.</L>
<L>There's heaue, and shoue, and hold, and draw;</L>
<L>That <HI>Severne</HI> can them scarce divide,</L>
<L>Till Iudgment may the Cause decide.</L>
</LG>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THis while in <HI>Sabrin's</HI> Court strong factions strangely grew,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Cernwall</HI> for her owne, and as her proper due,</L>
<L>Claim'd <HI>Lundy,</HI> which was said to <HI>Cambria</HI> to belong,</L>
<L>Who oft had sought redresse for that her ancient wrong:</L>
<L>But her inveterate Foe, borne-out by <HI>Englands</HI> might,</L>
<L>O're-swaies her weaker power; that (now in eithers right)</L>
<L>As <HI>Severne</HI> finds no Flood so great, nor poorelie meane,</L>
<L>But that the naturall Spring (her force which doth maintaine)</L>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">From Eng∣land or Wales.</NOTE> From this or that shee takes; so from this Faction free</L>
<L>(Begun about this Ile) not one was like to bee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This <HI>Lundy</HI> is a Nymph to idletoyes inclin'd;</L>
<L>And, all on pleasure set, doth wholliegiue her mind</L>
<L>To see vpon her shores her Fowle and Conies fed,</L>
<L>§ And wantonlie to hatch the Birds of <HI>Ganimed.</HI></L>
<L>Of trafique or returne shee neuer taketh care:</L>
<L>Not prouident of pelfe, as many Ilands are:</L>
<PB N="56" REF="49"/>
<L>A lustie black-brow'd Girle, with forehead broad and hie,</L>
<L>That often had bewitcht the Sea-gods with her eye.</L>
<L>Of all the In-laid Iles her Soueraigne <HI>Seuerne</HI> keepes,</L>
<L>That bathe their amorous breasts within her secret Deepes</L>
<L>(To loue her <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Certaine little Iles lying with∣in <HI>Seuerne.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Barry</HI> much and <HI>Silly</HI> though shee seeme,</L>

<L>This noblest <HI>British</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Severne.</NOTE> Nymph yet likes her <HI>Lundy</HI> best,</L>
<L>And to great <HI>Neptunes</HI> grace preferres before the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Wales.</NOTE> <HI>Cambria</HI> to her right that would her selfe restore,</L>
<L>And rather then to lose <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">England.</NOTE> <HI>Loëgria,</HI> lookes for more;</L>
<L>The Nymphs of either part, whom passion doth invade,</L>
<L>To triall straight will goe, though <HI>Neptune</HI> should disswade:</L>
<L>But of the weaker sex, the most part full of spleene,</L>
<L>And onely wanting strength to wreake their angry teene,</L>
<L>For skill their challenge make, which euerie one profest,</L>
<L>And in the learned Arts (of knowledges the best,</L>
<L>And to th'heroïck spirit most pleasing vnder skie)</L>
<L>Sweet Musick, rightlie matcht with heauenlie Poësie,</L>
<L>In which they all exceed: and in this kind alone</L>
<L>They Conquerers vow to be, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ouerthrowne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Which when faire <HI>Sabrine</HI> saw (as shee is wondrous wise)</L>
<L>And that it were in vaine them better to advise,</L>
<L>Sith this contention sprang from Countries like alli'd,</L>
<L>That shee would not be found t'incline to either side,</L>
<L>To mightie <HI>Neptune</HI> sues to haue his free consent</L>
<L>Duetriall they might make: When he incontinent</L>
<L>His <HI>Trytons</HI> sendeth out the challenge to proclaime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No sooner that divulg'd in his so dreadfull name,</L>
<L>But such a shout was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neighboring Spring,</L>

<L>Set out with such a traine as bore so great a sway,</L>
<L>The soyle but scaroely serues to giue her hugenesse way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then the <HI>Deuonian Tawe,</HI> from <HI>Dertmore</HI> deckt with pearle,</L>
<L>Vnto the conflict comes: with her that gallant Girle</L>
<L>§ Cleere <HI>Towridge,</HI> whom they fear'd would haue estrang'd her fall:</L>

<L>That paint their goodlie breasts with sundrie sorts of Ore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>British,</HI> that this while had stood a view to take</L>
<L>What to her vtmost power the publique Foe could make,</L>
<L>But slightlie weigh their strength: for, by her naturall kind,</L>

<L>So, trusting to their skill, and goodnes of their Cause,</L>
<L>For speedie Triall call, and for indifferent Lawes.</L>
</LG>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE ARGVMENT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>The Muse from <HI>Cambria</HI> comes againe,</L>
<L>To view the Forrest of faire <HI>Deane;</HI></L>

<L>How Feuer-like the sicknes shakes her;</L>
<L>Makes mightie <HI>Maluerne</HI> speake his mind</L>
<L>In honour of the Mountaine kind;</L>
<L>Thence wafted with a merry gale,</L>
<L>Sees <HI>Lemster,</HI> and the <HI>Golden Vale;</HI></L>
<L>Sports with the Nymphs, themselues that ply</L>
<L>At th'wedding of the <HI>Lug</HI> and <HI>Wy;</HI></L>
<L>Viewing the <HI>Herefordian</HI> pride</L>
<L>Along on <HI>Severns</HI> setting side,</L>
<L>That small Wigornian part survaies:</L>
<L>Where for a while herselfe shee staies.</L>

</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>HIgh matters call our Muse, inviting her to see</L>
<L>As well the lower Lands, as those where latelie shee</L>
<L>The <HI>Camhrian</HI> Mountaines clome, &amp; (looking from aloft)</L>
<L>Survaid coy <HI>Severns</HI> course: but now to shores more soft</L>
<L>Shee shapes her prosperous saile; and in this loftie Song,</L>
<L>The <HI>Herefor dian</HI> floods invites with her along,</L>
<L>§ That fraught from plentious <HI>Powse,</HI> with their superfluous waste,</L>
<L>Manure the batfull <HI>March,</HI> vntill they be imbrac't</L>
<L>In <HI>Sabrins</HI> Soueraigne armes: with whose tumultuous waues</L>
<L>§ Shut vp in narrower bounds, the <HI>Higre</HI> wildly raues;</L>
<L>And frights the stragling flocks, the neighbouring shores to flie,</L>
<L>A farre as from the Maine it comes with hideous cry,</L>
<L>And on the angry front the curled foame doth bring,</L>
<L>The billowes gainst the banks when fiercely it doth fling;</L>
<L>Hurles vp the slimie ooze, and makes the scalie brood</L>
<L>Leape madding to the Land affrighted from the flood;</L>
<L>Oreturnes the toyling Barge, whose steresman doth not lanch,</L>
<L>And thrusts the furrowing beake into her irefull panch:</L>
<PB N="102" REF="76"/>
<L>As when we haplie see a sicklie woman fall</L>
<L>Into a fit of that which wee the Mother call,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Simile ex∣pressing the <HI>Boare</HI> or <HI>Higre.</HI></NOTE> When from the grieued wombe shee feeles the paine arise,</L>
<L>Breakes into grieuous sighes, with intermixed cries,</L>
<L>Bereaued of her sense; and strugling still with those</L>
<L>That gainst her rising paine their vtmost strength oppose,</L>
<L>Starts, tosses, tumbles, strikes, turnes, touses, spurnes and spraules,</L>
<L>Casting with furious lims her holders to the walles;</L>
<L>But that the horrid pangs torments the grieued so,</L>
<L>One well might muse frō whence this suddaine strength should grow.</L>

<L>Here (Queene of Forrests all, that West of <HI>Severne</HI> lie)</L>
<L>Her broad and bushie top <HI>Deane</HI> holdeth vp so hie,</L>

<L>Shee retchlesse of their wrongs (her <HI>Satyres</HI> scapes to hide)</L>
<L>Vnto their iust complaint not once her eare enclines:</L>
<L>So fruitfuli in her Woods, and wealthy in her Mines,</L>
<L>That <HI>Leden</HI> which her way doth through the Desert make,</L>
<L>Though neere to <HI>Deane</HI> ally'd, determin'd to for sake</L>
<L>Her course, and her cleere lims amongst the bushes hide,</L>
<L>Least by the <HI>Syluans</HI> (should she chance to be espide)</L>
<L>Shee might vnmaidned goe vnto her Soueraigne Flood:</L>
<L>So manie were the rapes done on the watry brood,</L>

<L>The Mountaines euery way about him that doe stand,</L>
<L>Of whom hee's daily seene, and seeing doth command;</L>
<L>On tiptoes set aloft, this proudlie vttereth hee:</L>

<L><HI>Olympus,</HI> fayr'st of Hills, that Heauen art said to bee,</L>
<L>I not envie thy state, nor lesse my selfe doe make;</L>

<L>Nor would I, as thou doost, ambitiouslie aspire</L>

<L>For, didst thou taste the sweets that on my face doe breathe,</L>
<L>Aboue thou wouldst not seeke what I enioy beneath:</L>
<L>Besides, the sundry soyles I euery where survay,</L>
<L>Make me, if better not, thy equall euerie way.</L>
<L>And more, in our defence, to answere those, with spight</L>
<L>That tearme vs barren, rude, and voide of all delight;</L>
<L>Wee Mountaines, to the Land, like Warts or Wens to bee,</L>
<L>By which, fair'st liuing things disfigur'd oft they see;</L>
<L>This stronglie to performe, a well stuft braine would need.</L>
<L>And manie Hills there be, if they this Cause would heed,</L>
<L>Hauing their rising tops familiar with the skie</L>
<L>(From whence all wit proceeds) that fitter were then I</L>

<L>Yet, falling to my lot, This stoutlie I maintaine</L>

<L>And all their flatter kind (so much that doe relie</L>

<L>The Mountaine is the King: and he it is alone</L>
<L>Aboue the other soyles that Nature doth in-throne.</L>
<L>For Mountaines be like Men of braue heroïque mind,</L>
<L>With eyes erect to heauen, of whence themselues they find;</L>
<L>Whereas the lowlie Vale, as earthlie, like it selfe,</L>
<L>Doth neuer further looke then how to purchase pelfe.</L>
<L>And of their batfull sites, the Vales that boast them thus,</L>
<L>Nere had been what they are, had it not been for vs:</L>
<L>For, from the rising banks that stronglie mound them in,</L>
<L>The Valley (as betwixt) her name did first begin:</L>
<L>And almost not a Brooke, if shee her banks doe fill,</L>
<L>But hath her plentious Spring from Mountaine or from Hill.</L>
<L>If Mead, or lower Slade, grieue at the roome we take,</L>
<L>Knowe that the snowe or raine, descending oft, doth make</L>
<L>The fruitfully Valley fat, with what from vs doth glide,</L>
<L>Who with our Winters waste maintaine their Sommers pride.</L>
<L>And to you lower Lands if terrible wee seeme,</L>
<L>And couer'd oft with clowds; it is your foggy steame</L>
<L>The powerfull Sunne exhales, that in the cooler day</L>
<L>Vnto this Region comne, about our tops doth stay.</L>
<L>And, what's the Groue, so much that thinks her to be grac't,</L>
<L>If not aboue the rest vpon the Mountaine plac't,</L>
<L>Where shee her curled head vnto the eye may showe.</L>
<L>For, in the easie Vale if shee be set belowe,</L>
<PB N="104" REF="77"/>
<L>What is shee but obscure? and her more dampie shade</L>
<L>And covert, but a Den for beasts of rayin made?</L>
<L>Besides, wee are the Marks, which looking from an hie,</L>
<L>The trauailer beholds, and with a cheerfull eye</L>
<L>Doth thereby shape his course, and freshlie doth pursue</L>
<L>The way which long before lay tedious in his view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Forrest, Flood, or Field, that standeth not in awe</L>
<L>Of <HI>Sina,</HI> or shall see the sight that Mountaine saw?</L>
<L>To none but to a Hill such grace was euer giuen:</L>
<L>As on his back tis said, great <HI>Atlas</HI> beares vp heauen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Latmus</HI> by the wise <HI>Endymion</HI> is renown'd;</L>
<L>That Hill, on whose high top he was the first that found</L>

<P>He meanes the <HI>Saxons,</HI> whose name, after learned men, is to the IV. Song de∣riued from a <HI>Scythian</HI> nation. It pleases the Muse in this passage to speake of that originall, as meane and vnworthy of comparison with the <HI>Troian British,</HI> drawne out of <HI>Iupiters</HI> blood by <HI>Venus, Anchises,</HI> and <HI>AEneas;</HI> I iustifie her phrase, for that the <HI>Scythian</HI> was indeed poore, yet voluntarily, not through want, liuing commonly in field-tents; and (as our <HI>Germans</HI> in <HI>Tacitus</HI>) so Stoi∣call, as not to care for the future, hauing prouision for the present, from natures liberality. But, if it were worth examining, you might find the <HI>Scythian</HI> as no∣ble and worthy a nation as any red of; and such a one as the <HI>English</HI> and others might be as proud to deriue themselues from, as any which do search for their ancestors glory in <HI>Troian</HI> ashes.

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell vs, ye haughtie Hills, why vainly thus you threat,</L>
<L>Esteeming vs so meane, compar'd to you so great.</L>
<L>To make you know your selues, you this must vnderstand,</L>
<L>That our great Maker layd the surface of the Land,</L>
<L>As levell as the Lake vntill the generall Flood,</L>

<L>So that the earth, by you (to check her mirthfull cheere)</L>
<L>May alwaies see (from heauen) those plagues that poured were</L>
<L>Vpon the former world; as t'were by scarres to showe</L>
<L>That still shee must remaine disfigur'd with the blowe:</L>

<L>That he whom Time so long, and strongly hath imbrac't,</L>
<L>Should be reiected quite? The reason vrged why,</L>
<L>Is by the generall foe thus answer'd by and by:</L>
<L>That <HI>Brutus,</HI> as you say, by Sea who hither came,</L>
<L>From whom you would suppose this Ile first tooke the name,</L>
<L>Mecrelie fictitious is; nor could the <HI>Romans</HI> heare</L>
<L>(Most studious of the truth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those times that were)</L>
<L>Of any such as hee: nay, they who most doe striue,</L>

<L>In all the large descent of <HI>Iulus,</HI> neuer found</L>
<L>That <HI>Brute,</HI> on whom wee might our first beginning ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To this Assertion, thus I faithfully reply;</L>
<L>And as a friend to Truth, doe constant lie denie</L>
<L>Antiquitie to them, as neerer to those times;</L>
<L>Their writings to precede our ancient <HI>British</HI> Rimes:</L>
<L>But that our noble <HI>Bards</HI> which so diuinely sung</L>
<L>That remnant of old <HI>Troy,</HI> of which the <HI>Britaines</HI> sprung,</L>
<L>Before those <HI>Romans</HI> were, as proofe we can produce;</L>
<L>§ And learning, long with vs, eret'was with them in vse.</L>
<L>And they but idly talke, vpbrayding vs with lies.</L>

<L>Not heard of till his time our Aduersary saies:</L>
<L>When pregnantlie wee proue, ere that Historians dayes,</L>
<L>A thousand ling'ring yeeres, our Prophets cleerely song</L>
<L>The Britaine-founding <HI>Brute,</HI> most frequent them among.</L>
<L>From <HI>Taliessen</HI> wise (approued so with vs,</L>
<L>That what he spake, was held to be oraculous,</L>
<L>So true his writings were) and such immortall men</L>
<L>As this now-waning world shall hardly heare agen</L>
<L>In our owne genuine tongue, that natiues were of <HI>Wales</HI></L>
<L>Our <HI>Geffray</HI> had his <HI>Brute.</HI> Nor were these idle tales</L>
<PB N="163" REF="112"/>
<L>(As he may find, the truth of our descents that seekes)</L>
<L>Nor fabulous, like those deuised by the <HI>Greeks:</HI></L>
<L>But from the first of Time, by Iudges still were heard,</L>
<L>Discreetlie euery <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">At the <HI>Steth∣ua:</HI> see to the fourth Song.</NOTE> yeere correcting where they err'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And that whereon our Foe his greatest hold doth take,</L>
<L>Against the handled Cause and most doth seeme to make,</L>
<L>Is, that we shewe no Booke our <HI>Brutus</HI> to approue;</L>
<L>But that our idle <HI>Bards,</HI> as their fond rage did moue,</L>
<L>Sang what their fancies pleas'd. Thus doe I answere these;</L>
<L>That th'ancient <HI>British</HI> Priests, the fearlesse <HI>Druides,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Druides</HI> would not cō∣mit their my∣steries to wry∣ting.</NOTE></L>
<L>That ministred the lawes, and were so trulie wise,</L>
<L>That they determin'd states, attending sacrifice,</L>
<L>§ To letters neuer would their mysteries commit,</L>
<L>For which the breasts of men they deem'd to be more fit.</L>
<L>VVhich questionlesse should seeme from iudgement to proceed.</L>
<L>For, when of Ages past wee looke in bookes to read,</L>
<L>Wee retchlesly discharge our memory of those.</L>
<L>So when iniurious Time, such Monuments doth lose</L>
<L>(As what so great a Work, by Time that is not wrackt?)</L>
<L>VVee vtterly forgoe that memorable act:</L>
<L>But when we lay it vp within the minds of men,</L>
<L>They leaue it their next Age; that, leaues it hers agen:</L>
<L>So strongly which (me thinks) doth for Tradition make,</L>
<L>As if you from the world it altogether take,</L>
<L>You vtterly subuert Antiquitie thereby.</L>
<L>For though Time well may proue that often shee doth lie,</L>
<L>Posteritie by her yet many things hath known,</L>
<L>That ere men learn'd to write, could no way haue been shown:</L>
<L>For, if the spirit of God, did not our faith assure</L>
<L>The Scriptures be from heauen, like heauen, diuinely pure,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Moses</HI> mightie works, I reuerently may say</L>
<L>(I speake with godlie feare) Tradition put away,</L>
<L>In power of humane wit it easely doth not lie</L>
<L>To proue before the Flood the Genealogie.</L>
<L>Nor any thing there is that kindlier doth agree</L>
<L>With our descent from <HI>Troy</HI> (if things compar'd may be)</L>
<L>Then peopling of this place, neere to those Ages, when</L>
<L>Exiled by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> those poore world-wandring men</L>
<L>(Of all hope to returne into their Country reft)</L>
<L>Sought shores whereon to set that little them was left:</L>
<L>From some such God-like race we questionlesse did spring,</L>
<L>Who soone became so great heere once inhabiting.</L>
<L>So barbarous nor were wee as manie haue vs made,</L>
<L>And <HI>Coesars</HI> envious pen would all the world perswade,</L>
<L>His owne ambitious ends in seeking to aduance,</L>
<L>When with his <HI>Roman</HI> power arriuing heere from <HI>France,</HI></L>

<L>If hee the <HI>Britains</HI> found experienc't so in warre,</L>
<L>That they with such great skill could weeld their armed Carre;</L>
<L>And, as he still came on, his skilfull march to let,</L>

<L>And as the Vision show'd, he such a Palmer found,</L>
<L>VVith others of his sort, there sitting on the ground:</L>
<L>VVhere, for some poore repast they onely seem'd to stay,</L>
<L>Else ready to depart each one vpon his way:</L>
<L>When secretly the King revealed to the Knight</L>
<L>His comfortable dreames that lately passed night:</L>
<L>VVith mild and princely words bespeaking him; quoth hee,</L>
<L>Farre better you are knowne to heauen (it seemes) then mee</L>

<LG>
<L>The Palmer (gray with age) with countenance lowting lowe,</L>
<L>His head euen to the earth before the King doth bow,</L>
<L>Him softly answering thus; Drad Lord, it fits mee ill</L>
<L>(A wretched man) t'oppose high heauens eternall will:</L>

<L>Those times are gone with me; and, beeing aged now,</L>

<L>The King much pleas'd in mind, assumes his wonted cheere,</L>
<L>And to the <HI>Danish</HI> power his choicest Herault sent.</L>
<L>When, both through Campe and Court, this Combat quickly went.</L>
<L>VVhich suddainly divolg'd, whilst euery listning eare,</L>

<L>Betwixt the Tent and Towne, to eithers equall sight,</L>

<LG>
<L>The day prefixt once com'n, both <HI>Dane</HI> and <HI>English</HI> rise,</L>
<L>And to th'appointed place th'vnnumbred people throng:</L>
<L>The weaker female sex, old men, and children young</L>
<L>Into the windowes get, and vp on stalls, to see</L>
<L>The man on whose braue hand their hope that day must bee.</L>
<L>In noting of it well, there might a man behold</L>
<L>More sundry formes of feare then thought imagine could.</L>
<L>One looks vpon his friend with sad and heauy cheere,</L>
<L>Who seemes in this distresse a part with him to beare:</L>
<L>Their passions doe expresse much pittie mixt with rage.</L>
<L>VVhilst one his wiues laments is labouring to asswage,</L>
<L>His little infant neere, in childish gibbridge showes</L>
<L>What addeth to his griefe who sought to calme her woes.</L>
<L>One hauing climb'd some roofe, the concourse to discry,</L>
<L>From thence vpon the earth deiects his humble eye,</L>
<L>As since he thither came hee suddainly had found</L>
<L>Some danger them amongst which lurkt vpon the ground.</L>
<L>One stands with fixed eyes, as though he were agast:</L>
<L>Another sadly comes, as though his hopes were past.</L>
<L>This harkneth with his friend, as though with him to breake</L>
<L>Of some intended act. Whilst they together speake,</L>
<L>Another standeth neere to listen what they say,</L>
<L>Or what should be the end of this so doubtfull day.</L>
<L>One great and generall face the gathered people seeme:</L>
<L>So that the perfect'st sight beholding could not deeme</L>
<L>What lookes most sorrow show'd; their griefes so equall were.</L>
<L>Vpon the heads of two, whose cheekes were ioynd so neere</L>
<L>As if together growne, a third his chin doth rest:</L>
<L>Another lookes or'e his: and others, hardly prest,</L>
<L>Lookt vnder-neath their armes. Thus, whilst in crowds they throng</L>
<L>(Led by the King himselfe) the Champion comes along;</L>
<L>A man well strooke in yeeres, in homely Palmers gray,</L>
<L>And in his hand his staffe, his reuerent steps to stay,</L>
<L>Holding a comly pase: which at his passing by,</L>
<L>In euery censuring tongue, as euery serious eye,</L>
<PB N="201" REF="134"/>
<L>Compassion mixt with feare, distrust and courage, bred.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Colebrond</HI> for the <HI>Danes</HI> came forth in irefull red;</L>
<L>Before him (from the Campe) an Ensigne first display'd</L>
<L>Amidst a guard of gleaues: then sumptuously array'd</L>
<L>Were twenty gallant youths, that to the warlike sound</L>
<L>Of <HI>Danish</HI> brazen Drums, with many a loftie bound,</L>
<L>Come with their Countries march, as they to <HI>Mars</HI> should dance.</L>
<L>Thus, forward to the fight, both Champions them advance:</L>
<L>And each without respect doth resolutely chuse</L>
<L>The weapon that he brought, nor doth his foes refuse.</L>
<L>The <HI>Dane</HI> prepares his Axe, that pond'rous was to feele,</L>
<L>VVhose squares were layd with plates, and riuited with steele,</L>
<L>And armed downe along with pykes; whose hardned poynts</L>
<L>(Forc't with the weapons weight) had power to teare the ioynts</L>
<L>Of Curas or of Mayle, or what-so-ere they tooke:</L>
<L>Which caus'd him at the Knight disdainfully to looke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VVhen our stout Palmer soone (vnknowne for valiant <HI>Guy</HI>)</L>
<L>The cord from his straight loynes doth presently vntie,</L>
<L>Puts off his Palmers weede vnto his trusse, which bore</L>
<L>The staines of ancient Armes, but show'd it had before</L>
<L>Beene costly cloth of Gold; and off his hood he threw:</L>
<L>Out of his Hermits staffe his two-hand sword hee drew</L>
<L>(The vnsuspected sheath which long to it had beene)</L>
<L>Which till that instant time the people had not seene;</L>
<L>A sword so often try'd. Then to himselfe, quoth hee,</L>
<L>Armes let me craue your ayde, to set my Country free:</L>
<L>And neuer shall my hart your help againe require,</L>
<L>But onely to my God to lift you vp in pray'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, <HI>Colebrond</HI> forward made, and soone the Christian Knight</L>
<L>Encounters him againe with equall power and spight:</L>
<L>Whereas, betwixt them two, might easely haue been seene</L>
<L>Such blowes, in publique throngs as vsed had they been,</L>
<L>Of many there the least might many men haue slaine:</L>
<L>Which none but they could strike, nor none but they sustaine;</L>
<L>The most relentlesse eye that had the power to awe,</L>
<L>And so great wonder bred in those the Fight that saw,</L>
<L>As verily they thought, that Nature vntill then</L>
<L>Had purposely reseru'd the vtmost power of men,</L>
<L>VVhere strength still answerd strength, on courage courage grew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Looke how two Lyons fierce, both hungry, both pursue</L>
<L>One sweet and selfe-same prey, at one another flie,</L>
<L>And with their armed pawes ingrappled dreadfully,</L>
<L>The thunder of their rage, and boy strous struggling, make</L>
<L>The neighboring Forrests round affrightedly to quake:</L>
<L>Their sad encounter, such. The mightie <HI>Colebroud</HI> stroke</L>
<L>A cruell blowe at <HI>Guy:</HI> which though hee finely broke,</L>
<PB N="202" REF="135"/>
<L>Yet (with the weapons weight) his ancient hilt it split,</L>
<L>And (thereby lessened much) the Champion lightly hit</L>
<L>Vpon the reuerent brow: immediatly from whence</L>
<L>The blood dropt softly downe, as if the wound had sense</L>
<L>Of their much inward woe that it with griefe should see.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Danes,</HI> a deadly blowe supposing it to bee,</L>
<L>Sent such an ecchoing shoute that rent the troubled ayre.</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> at the noise, wext all so wan with seare,</L>
<L>As though They lost the blood their aged Champion shed:</L>
<L>Yet were not these so pale, but th'other were as red;</L>
<L>As though the blood that fell, vpon their cheekes had staid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here <HI>Guy,</HI> his better spirits recalling to his ayde,</L>
<L>Came fresh vpon his foe; when mightie <HI>Colebrond</HI> makes</L>
<L>An other desperate stroke: which <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Warwick</HI> takes</L>
<L>Vndauntedly aloft; and followed with a blowe</L>
<L>Vpon his shorter ribs, that the excessiue flowe</L>
<L>Stream'd vp vnto his hilts: the wound so gap't withall,</L>
<L>As though it meant to say, Behold your Champions fall</L>
<L>By this proud Palmers hand. Such claps againe and cryes</L>
<L>The ioyfull <HI>English</HI> gaue as cleft the very skies.</L>
<L>VVhich comming on along from these that were without,</L>
<L>When those within the Towne receiu'd this cheerfull shout,</L>
<L>They answer'd them with like; as those their ioy that knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then with such eager blowes each other they pursue,</L>
<L>As euery offer made, should threaten imminent death;</L>
<L>Vntill, through heat and toyle both hardly drawing breath,</L>
<L>They desperatly doe close. Looke how two Boares, being set</L>
<L>Together side to side, their threatning tusks doe whet,</L>
<L>And with their gnashing teeth their angry foame doe bite,</L>
<L>Whilst still they shouldring seeke, each other where to smite:</L>
<L>Thus stood those irefull Knights; till flying back, at length</L>
<L>The Palmer, of the two the first recouering strength,</L>
<L>Vpon the left arme lent great <HI>Colebrond</HI> such a wound,</L>
<L>That whilst his weapons poynt fell wel-neere to the ground,</L>
<L>And slowly he it rais'd, the valiant <HI>Guy</HI> againe</L>
<L>Sent through his clouen scalpe his blade into his braine.</L>

<L>Where Empresse like shee sate with Natures bounties blest,</L>
<L>And seru'd by many a Nymph; but two, of all the rest,</L>
<L>That <HI>Staffordshire</HI> calls hers, there both of high account.</L>
<L>The eld'st of which is <HI>Canke:</HI> though <HI>Needwood</HI> her surmount,</L>

<L>For body, horne, and haire, as faire a Beast doth breed</L>
<L>As scarcely this great Ile can equall: then of her,</L>

<L>From <HI>Worstershire,</HI> and there is common as the fields;</L>
<L>Which naturally that soyle in most aboundance yeelds.</L>

<L>How <HI>Eushams</HI> fertile Vale at first in liking fell</L>
<L>With <HI>Cotswold,</HI> that great King of Shepheards: whose proud site</L>
<L>When that faire Vale first saw, so nourisht her delight,</L>
<L>That him she onely lov'd: for wisely shee beheld</L>
<L>The beauties cleane throughout that on his sur-face dweld:</L>
<L>Of iust and equall height two banks arising, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">A nice descrip∣tiō of <HI>Cotswold.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Grew poore (as it should seeme) to make some Valley rich:</L>
<L>Bet wixt them thrusting out an Elbowe of such height,</L>
<L>As shrowds the lower soyle; which, shadowed from the light,</L>
<L>Shootes forth a little Groue, that in the Sommers day</L>
<L>Invites the Flocks, for shade that to the Couert stray.</L>
<L>A Hill there holds his head, as though it told a tale,</L>
<L>Or stooped to looke downe, or whisper with a Vale;</L>
<L>Where little purling winds like wantons seeme to dally,</L>
<L>And skip from Bank to Banke, from Valley trip to Valley.</L>
<L>Such sundry shapes of soyle where Nature doth deuise,</L>
<L>That she may rather seeme fantasticall, then wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>T'whom <HI>Sarum's</HI> Plaine giues place: though famous for her Flocks,</L>
<L>Yet hardly doth she tythe our <HI>Cotswolds</HI> wealthy locks.</L>
<L>Though <HI>Lemster</HI> him exceed for finenesse of her ore,</L>
<L>Yet quite he puts her downe for his aboundant store.</L>
<L>A match so fit as hee, contenting to her mind,</L>
<L>Few Vales (as I suppose) like <HI>Eusham</HI> hapt to find:</L>
<L>Nor any other <HI>Wold,</HI> like <HI>Cotswold</HI> euer sped,</L>
<L>So faire and rich a Vale by fortuning to wed.</L>
<L>Hee hath the goodly Wooll, and shee the wealthy Graine:</L>
<L>Through which they wisely seeme their houshold to maintaine.</L>
<L>He hath pure wholesome Ayre, and daintie crystall Springs.</L>
<L>To those delights of his, shee daily profit brings:</L>
<L>As to his large expense, she multiplies her heapes:</L>
<L>Nor can his Flocks deuour th'aboundance that shee reaps;</L>
<L>As th'one with what it hath, the other stroue to grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, now that euery thing may in the proper place</L>
<L>Most aptly be contriu'd, the Sheepe our <HI>Wold</HI> doth breed</L>
<L>(The simplest though it seeme) shall our description need,</L>
<PB N="233" REF="154"/>
<L>And Shepheard-like, the Muse thus of that kind doth speak;</L>
<L>No browne, nor sullyed black the face or legs doth streak,</L>
<L>Like those of <HI>Moreland, Cank,</HI> or of the <HI>Cambrian</HI> hills</L>
<L>That lightly laden are: but <HI>Cotswold</HI> wisely fills</L>
<L>Her with the whitest kind: whose browes so woolly be,</L>
<L>As men in her faire Sheepe no emptiness should see.</L>
<L>The Staple deepe and thick, through, to the very graine,</L>
<L>Most strongly keepeth out the violentest raine:</L>
<L>A body long and large, the buttocks equall broad;</L>
<L>As fit to vnder-goe the full and weightie load.</L>
<L>And of the fleecie face, the flanke doth nothing lack,</L>
<L>But euery-where is stor'd; the belly, as the back.</L>
<L>The faire and goodly Flock, the Shepheards onely pride,</L>
<L>As white as Winters snowe, when from the Riuers side</L>
<L>He driues his new-washt Sheepe; or on the Sheering day,</L>
<L>When as the lusty Ram, with those rich spoyles of May</L>
<L>His crooked hornes hath crown'd; the Bell-weather, so braue</L>
<L>As none in all the Flock they like themselues would haue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Muse, returne to tell, how there the Sheepheards King,</L>
<L>Whose Flock hath chanc't that yeere the earliest Lambe to bring,</L>
<L>In his gay Bauldrick sits at his lowe grassie Bord,</L>
<L>With Flawns, Curds, Clowted-creame, and Country dainties stor'd:</L>
<L>And, whilst the Bag-pipe playes, each lustie iocund Swaine</L>
<L>Quaffes Sillibubs in Kans, to all vpon the Plaine,</L>
<L>And to their Country-Girles, whose Nosegayes they doe weare.</L>
<L>Some Roundelayes doe sing: the rest, the burthen beare.</L>

<L>Who feedes her <HI>Tame</HI> with Marle, in Cordiall-wise prepar'd,</L>

<L>Nor cares how <HI>Chiltern</HI> chides, so that her <HI>Tame</HI> be braue.</L>

a worke of the <HI>Romans</HI> also. But their courses are differently reported, and in some part their names also. The Author calls them <HI>Watling-street,</HI> the <HI>Fosse, Ikinild,</HI> and <HI>Rickeneld.</HI> This name of <HI>Rickeneld</HI> is in <HI>Randall</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI> and by him deriued from S. <HI>Dewies</HI> in <HI>Penbroke</HI> into <HI>Hereford,</HI> &amp; so through <HI>Wor∣cester, Warwick, Derby,</HI> and <HI>York</HI>-shires to <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> which (vpon the Authors credit reporting it to me) is also iustifiable by a very ancient deed of Lands, bounded neer <HI>Bermingham</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire</HI> by <HI>Rickeneld.</HI> To endeuor certain∣ty in them, were but to obtrude vnwarrantable coniecture, and abuse time &amp; you.

<L>Great <HI>Tames,</HI> as King of Riuers, sings</L>

</LG>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>AT length it came to passe, that <HI>Isis</HI> and her <HI>Tame</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>Medway</HI> vnderstood, a Nymph of wondrous fame;</L>
<L>And much desirous were, their princely <HI>Tames</HI> shuld proue</L>
<L>If (as a wooer) he could win her Maiden-loue;</L>
<L>That of so great descent, and of so large a Dower,</L>
<L>Might well-allie their House, and much increase his power:</L>
<L>And striuing to preferre their Sonne, the best they may,</L>
<L>Set forth the lusty Flood, in rich and braue array,</L>
<L>Bankt with imbrodered Meads, of sundry sutes of flowres,</L>
<L>His brest adorn'd with Swans, oft washt with siluer showres:</L>
<L>A traine of gallant Floods, at such a costly rate</L>
<L>As might beseeme their care, and fitting his estate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Attended and attyr'd magnificently thus,</L>
<L>They send him to the Court of great <HI>Oceanus,</HI></L>
<L>The Worlds huge wealth to see; yet with a full intent,</L>
<L>To wooe the louely Nymph, faire <HI>Medway,</HI> as he went.</L>
<L>Who to his Dame and Sire, his duty scarce had done,</L>
<L>And whil'st they sadly wept at parting of their Sonne,</L>
<L>See what the <HI>Tames</HI> befell, when t'was suspected least.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As still his goodly traine yet euery houre increast,</L>
<L>And from the <HI>Surrian</HI> shores cleere <HI>Wey</HI> came down to meet</L>
<L>His Greatnes, whom the <HI>Tames</HI> so gratiously doth greet,</L>
<PB N="285" REF="172"/>
<L>That with the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Comming by <HI>Fernham,</HI> so called of <HI>Ferne</HI> there growing.</NOTE> Fearne-crown'd Flood he Minion-like doth play:</L>
<L>Yet is not this the Brook, entiseth him to stay.</L>
<L>But as they thus, in pompe, came sporting on the shole,</L>
<L>Gainst <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> he meets the soft and gentle <HI>Mole.</HI></L>
<L>Whose eyes so pierc't his breast, that seeming to foreslowe</L>
<L>The way which he so long, intended was to go,</L>
<L>With trifling vp and down, he wandreth here and there;</L>
<L>And that he in her sight, transparent might appeare,</L>
<L>Applyes himselfe to Fords, and setteth his delight</L>
<L>On that which most might make him gratious in her sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Isis</HI> and the <HI>Tame</HI> from their conioyned bed,</L>
<L>Desirous still to learne how <HI>Tames</HI> their son had sped</L>
<L>(For greatly they had hop't, his time had so been spent,</L>
<L>That he ere this had won the goodly heyre of <HI>Kent</HI>)</L>
<L>And sending to enquire, had newes return'd againe</L>
<L>(By such as they imploy'd, on purpose in his traine)</L>
<L>How this their only heyre, the <HI>Iles</HI> emperiall Flood,</L>
<L>Had loytered thus in loue, neglectfull of his good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No maruaile (at the newes) though <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Comming by <HI>Fernham,</HI> so called of <HI>Ferne</HI> there growing.</NOTE> <HI>Ouse</HI> and <HI>Tame</HI> were sad,</L>
<L>More comfort of their sonne expecting to haue had.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isis.</NOTE></L>
<L>Nor blame them, in their looks much sorrow though they show'd:</L>
<L>Who fearing least he might thus meanely be bestow'd,</L>
<L>And knowing danger still increased by delay,</L>
<L>Employ their vtmost power, to hasten him away.</L>
<L>But <HI>Tames</HI> would hardly on: oft turning back to show,</L>
<L>From his much loued <HI>Mole</HI> how loth he was to go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mother of the <HI>Mole,</HI> old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Comming by <HI>Fernham,</HI> so called of <HI>Ferne</HI> there growing.</NOTE> <HI>Homesdale,</HI> likewise beares<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very woody Vale in <HI>Surry.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Th'affection of her childe, as ill as they do theirs:</L>
<L>Who nobly though deriu'd, yet could haue been content,</L>
<L>T'haue matcht her with a Flood, of farre more mean descent.</L>
<L>But <HI>Mole</HI> respects her words, as vaine and idle dreames,</L>
<L>Compar'd with that high ioy, to be belou'd of <HI>Tames:</HI></L>
<L>And head-long holds her course, his company to win.</L>
<L>But, <HI>Homesdale</HI> raised Hills, to keep the straggler in;</L>
<L>That of her daughters stay she need no more to doubt:</L>
<L>(Yet neuer was there help, but loue could finde it out.)</L>
<L>§ <HI>Mole</HI> digs her selfe a Path, by working day and night</L>
<L>(According to her name, to shew her nature right)</L>
<L>And vnderneath the Earth, for three miles space doth creep:</L>
<L>Till gotten out of sight, quite from her mothers keep,</L>
<L>Her foreintended course the wanton Nymph doth run;</L>
<L>As longing to imbrace old <HI>Tame</HI> and <HI>Isis</HI> son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Tames</HI> now vnderstood, what paines the <HI>Mole</HI> did take,</L>
<L>How farre the louing Nymph aduentur'd for his sake;</L>
<L>Although with <HI>Medway</HI> matcht, yet neuer could remoue</L>
<L>The often quickning sparks of his more ancient loue.</L>
<PB N="259" REF="172"/>
<L>So that it comes to passe, when by great Natures guide</L>
<L>The <HI>Ocean</HI> doth returne, and thrusteth-in the Tide;</L>

<L>§ He euer since doth flow, beyond delightfull <HI>Sheene.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Wandal</HI> commeth in, the <HI>Moles</HI> beloued mate,</L>
<L>So amiable, faire, so pure, so delicate,</L>
<L>So plump, so full, so fresh, her eyes so wondrous cleer:</L>

<P>Thus did the Conquerors Posterity vnquietly possesse their Fathers inheri∣tance. <HI>William</HI> had much to do with his brother <HI>Robert,</HI> iustly grudging at his vsurping the Crowne from right of Primogeniture; but so much the lesse, in that <HI>Robert</HI> with diuers other <HI>German</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Princes left all priuate re∣spects for the Holy warre, which after the Crosse vndertaken (as those times v∣sed) had most fortunate successe in Recouery of <HI>Palestine.

Hauing thus gain'd to him most of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, he lands with forces at <HI>Portesmouth,</HI> thence marching towards <HI>Winchester:</HI> but before any encounter the two Brothers were perswa∣ded to a Peace; Couenant was made and confirmed by oth of XII.

This Peace, vpon denial of paiment (which had the better colour, because, at request of Q. <HI>Maude,</HI> the Duke prodigally released his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. pounds the next yeere after the Couenant) was soone broken. The K. (to preuent what mischief might follow a second arriuall of his brother) assisted by the greatest fauours of <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>Aniou,</HI> besieged Duke <HI>Robert</HI> in one of his Castles, took him, brought him home Captiue, and at length vsing that course (next secure to death) so often red of in <HI>Choniates Cantucuzen,</HI> and other Orientall stories, put out his eyes, being all this time imprisoned in <HI>Cardiffe</HI> Castle in <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> where he miserably breathed his last. It is by <HI>Polydore</HI> added, out of some au∣thoritie, that K. <HI>Henry</HI> after a few yeers imprisonment released him, and com∣manded that within XL. daies and 12. houres (these houres haue in them time of two Flouds, or a Floud and an Ebb) he should, abiuring <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Nor∣manay,</HI> passe the seas as in perpetuall Exile; and that in the meane time, vpon new Treasons attempted by him, he was secondly committed, and endured his punishment and death as the common Monks relate. I find no warrantable authority that makes me beleeue it: Yet, because it giues some kind of ex∣ample of our Obsolet law of Abiuration (which it seems had its beginning frō one of the statutes published vnder name of the <HI>Confessor</HI>) a word or two of the time prescribed here for his passage: which being examined vpon <HI>Brac∣tons</HI> credit, makes the report therein faulty.

For K. <HI>Iohn</HI> would by no means endure this <HI>Stephen,</HI> nor permit him the dignity after his vniust Election at <HI>Rome,</HI> but banished the Moonks and stoutly menaces the Pope.

Thus for a while continued the Realme without diuine <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Exercise, excepted only Confession, Ex∣treame vnction, and Baptisme; the King being also excommunicated and burials allowed onely in high-waies, and ditches without Ecclesiastique Ce∣remonie, &amp; (but only by indulgence procur'd by Archbishop <HI>Langton</HI> which purcha'st fauor that in all the Monasteries, excepting of <HI>White-Friers,</HI> might be diuine seruice once a week) had no change, for some IV. or V. yeers, when the Pope in a solemn Councell of Cardinals, according to his pretended plenary power, depos'd K. <HI>Iohn,</HI> and immediatly by his Legat <HI>Pandulph</HI> offered to <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> II. of <HI>France</HI> the kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> This with suspicion of the subiects heart at home, and another cause then more esteemed then either of these, that is, the prophecie of one <HI>Peter</HI> an Hermit in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> foretelling to his face <HI>that before Holy-Thursday following he should be no King,</HI> altered his stiffe, and re∣solute, but too disturbed affections; and perswaded him by Oth of himself and XVI. more of his Barons, to make submission to the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> &amp; condis∣cended to giue for satisfaction, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. pounds sterling (that name of <HI>Sterling</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Io Stou. in No∣tit.

<Q>Of these two factions stil'd, of <HI>Yorke</HI> and <HI>Lancaster.</HI></Q>

</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>OVr <HI>Argas</HI> scarcely yet deliuered of her sonne,</L>
<L>VVhen as the Riuer downe, through <HI>Andredsweald</HI> dooth run:</L>
<L>Nor can the aged Hill haue comfort of her childe.</L>
<L>For, liuing in the VVoods, her <HI>Rother</HI> waxed wilde;</L>
<L>His Banks with aged Okes, and Bushes ouer-growne,</L>
<L>That from the <HI>Syluans</HI> kinde, he hardly could be knowne:</L>
<L>Yea, many a time the Nymphes, which hapt this Flood to see,</L>
<L>Fled from him, whom they sure a Satyre thought to be;</L>
<L>As Satyre-like he held all pleasures in disdaine,</L>
<L>And would not once vouchsafe, to look vpon a Plaine;</L>
<L>Till chancing in his course he to view a goodly plot,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Albion</HI> in his youth, vpon a Sea Nymph got,</L>
<L>For <HI>Oxney's</HI> loue he pines: who being wildly chaste,</L>
<L>And neuer woo'd before, was coy to be imbrac't.</L>
<L>But, what obdurate heart, was euer so peruerse,</L>
<L>Whom yet a louers plaints, with patience, could not pearce?</L>
<L>For, in this conflict she being lastly ouerthrowne,</L>
<L>In-Iled in his Armes, he clips her for his owne,</L>
<L>Who being grosse and black, she lik't the Riuer well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of <HI>Rothers</HI> happy match, when <HI>Rumney</HI> Marsh heard tell,</L>
<L>Whyi'st in his youthfull course himselfe he doth apply,</L>
<L>And falleth in her sight into the Sea at <HI>Rye,</HI></L>
<PB N="284" REF="186"/>
<L>She thinketh with her selfe, how she a way might finde</L>
<L>To put the homely <HI>Ile</HI> quite out of <HI>Rothers</HI> minde; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of <HI>Rumney</HI> Marsh.</NOTE></L>
<L>Appearing to the Flood, most brauely like a Queene,</L>
<L>Clad (all) from head to foot, in gaudy Summers green;</L>
<L>Her mantle richly wrought, with sundry flowers and weeds;</L>
<L>Her moystfull temples bound, with wreaths of quiuering reeds:</L>
<L>Which loosely flowing downe, vpon her lusty thighes,</L>
<L>Most strongly seeme to tempt the Riuers amorous eyes.</L>
<L>And on her loynes a frock, with many a swelling pleate,</L>
<L>Embost with well-spread Horse, large Sheepe, and full-fed Neate.</L>
<L>Some wallowing in the grasse, there lie a while to batten;</L>
<L>Some sent away to kill; some thither brought to fatten;</L>
<L>With Villages amongst, oft powthred heere and there;</L>
<L>And (that the same more like to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The naturall expressing of the surface of a Country in Painting.</NOTE> Landskip should appeare)</L>
<L>With Lakes and lesser Foards, to mitigate the heate</L>
<L>(In Summer when the Fly doth prick the gadding Neate,</L>
<L>Forc't from the Brakes, where late they brouz'd the veluet buds)</L>
<L>In which, they lick their Hides, and chew their sauoury Cuds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of these her amourous toyes, when <HI>Oxney</HI> came to knowe,</L>
<L>Suspecting least in time her riuall she might growe,</L>
<L>Th'allu'rments of the Marsh, the icalous Ile do moue,</L>
<L>That to a constant course, she thus perswades her Loue:</L>
<L>With <HI>Rumney,</HI> though for dower I stand in no degree;</L>
<L>In this, to be belou'd yet liker farre then she:</L>
<L>Though I be browne, in me there doth no fauour lack.</L>
<L>The foule is said deform'd: and she, extreamely black.</L>
<L>And though her rich attire, so curious be and rare,</L>
<L>From her there yet proceeds vnwholsome putrid aire:</L>
<L>VVhere my complexion more sutes with the higher ground,</L>
<L>Vpon the lusty <HI>Weald,</HI> where strength doth still abound.</L>
<L>The Wood-gods I refus'd, that su'd to me sor grace,</L>
<L>Me in thy watry Armes, thee suffring to imbrace;</L>
<L>VVhere, to great <HI>Neptune</HI> she may one day be a pray:</L>
<L>The Sea-gods in her lap lie wallowing euery day.</L>
<L>And what, though of her strength she seem to make no doubt?</L>
<L>Yet put vnto the proofe shee'll hardly hold him out.</L>
</LG>
