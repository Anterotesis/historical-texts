<HEAD>A RISING IN Lancashire for <HI>Charles</HI> the second, the proclaiming of him King in the North of England, and a bloudy fight thereupon.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Royall party begins to declare very high for the declared King of Scots, against the present Au∣thority of this Nation, and insulteth very much over the wellaffected party, saying, That <HI>Charles</HI> shall be King, and woe be unto them that sayes against it; and upon Fri∣day last severall Gentlemen (extraordinary well mounted and gallantly armed) of quality came to Manchester, and there proclaimed Prince <HI>Charles</HI> (eldest Son to <HI>Charles</HI> the first) King of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> which done, they departed the town without interruption or molestati∣on; and from thence went to Wiggin, where they caused
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>the like to be proclaimed as formerly; and from thence they went to Kendall in Westmerland, where they met with some opposition at the proclaiming thereof; the man∣ner thus: A party of the Parliaments Souldiers having re∣ceived information of their design, prepared to receive them, and even in the nick of time came in upon them, dis∣puted the place with severall Vollies, and at last the Royall party seeing themselves overpowred in number, betooke themselves to a retreat, and by the swiftnesse of their horses made an honourable retreat, and escaped, with the losse of two men.</P>
<P>One Col. Walton is said to be the Commander in chiefe of the Royall party, and leaves no means unassayed for the advancing of his young Masters Cause.</P>
<P>The Parliament of Scotland seem to be exceedingly dis∣contented at the transaction of affairs in England, and at the present proceedings of their young King (as they say) and have sent a Message to the queen of Sweden, with a large Narative of what they did joyntly with the Parliament of England, where they fell off, how they detest their late pro∣ceedings, in reference to the executing of their late Sove∣raign Lord the King, how their young King is seduc'd by evill Councell, and from thence hath not given their Com∣missioners satisfaction necessary for his own and the King∣domes Weal, desiring her Majesty to send an Embassie unto him, to perswade him to a Condescension, and speedy A∣greement; <HI>but this seems a mystery to many, divers conceiving it to be one of</HI> Jockies <HI>new Riddles.</HI></P>
<P>For it is frequently said, that the Articles of Agreement are already concluded of, and that they begin to cast this Mist, only to obscure the eye-sight of the English until they have brought to maturity their design in hand, for the rai∣sing of 15000 Horse and Foot to joyn with the 5000 alrea∣dy
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>in Arms, which they pretend to be for the safety of that kingdom against forraign Invasion. Only Gen. Lesley denies the Generalship, the Marq. of Argyle its conceived will be chosen Commander in chief.</P>
<P>His Excellency Generall Lesley being desired to deliver up the strong Castle of Edenburgh, returned answer, That he was resolved to keepe it for the succession of those who had entrusted him, meaning the late <HI>King of Great Brittain, Charles the first.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament are very private in their debates, and (say some) are resolved to shake the foundation of Heresie.</P>
<P>Lievtenant Collonel Hobson is come to Edenburgh, his businesse is variously spoken, some whisper that he desires passage for some to go for Ireland, others to make way for some farther overture from Parl of England, what ever it is he is looked upon with a jealous eye.</P>
<P>From the Isle of Man our Intelligence saith, That Sir <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> and many other English Gallants, have made great preparations in that Island against the Parliament of England, and are resolved for Ireland, to assist the Marquesse of Ormond, and strengthen the siege at Dublin; from whence it is said, that the Parliaments party is reduced to Dublin, Dredah, Dundale, Trim, and London-Derry, the first &amp; last being besieged; by Ormonds coming up to Dublin he hath got the greatest part of five Counties from Col. Jones, which afforded him many thousand pounds contribution.</P>
<P>We hear that Gen. <HI>Oneal</HI> is united with <HI>Ormond,</HI> and hath strengthned his Camp with 4000 Foot, the E. of <HI>Clanrickard</HI> and Col. <HI>Monro</HI> is expected there with another Brigade, by which means they will be both potent and powerfull, the Army amounting to above 20000 Horse and Foot.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Marq. of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the L. <HI>Inchiquin</HI> with 14000 Horse and Foot, have intrenched themselves (in many places) within Musquet shot of the Walls, and by their strong allarums keeps us in continuall action: the last night their Pioneers wrought exceeding hard, and raised an half Moon within musket shot of the North Port, where was placed about 200 musketiers, and four pieces of Ord∣nance; it was contrived very artificially and strong, with a running Trench from their frontier incampings: this mor∣ing we sallyed out upon them, with a resolution to beat hem off from the said Fort; but finding too much opposi∣ion retreated to our Redout, which was within Pistoll shot hereof; about 4 of the clock severall parties of horse and oot were drawn forth on both sides, who engaged each o∣ther, and after a sharp conflict disputed with great gallantry the enemy retreated, and having a Reserve ready at hand our men durst not embrace the pursuit, but returned Victors with 7 prisoners, 9 horses, and left dead and wounded upon the place about 15 with the losse of 9 men, which the ene∣my in the night time set off and buryed.</P>
<P>In one of our former Sallies, Capt. <HI>Glyn</HI> with a party of 30 horse fell upon a desperate party of the Besiegers, and after a sharp dispute took</P>

<P>We are seldome out of action, and our renowned Gover∣nour is infinitely tyred out, having not been in his bed these ten nights, and most part of the day is viewing the enemy, or repairing our Works and Fortifications, and planting pieces round the Line: the Irish Officers have made choice of a great Episcopal Bishop to be their chief Engineer, who acts and studies very politikely both spiritually and tem∣porally.</P>
<P>Our condition being dangerous, causeth sadnesse unto us, e∣evry day the enemy being strong, and our men many of them persidious, most dishonourable, betraying their trust, the Lord <HI>Moon</HI> with a gallant troop of horse, is gone to the enemy, who upon a salley forth, pretended to engage against them, but when he was within pistoll shot, faced about, and fell upon a party of our own horse, a troop of Sir <HI>Thomas Armstrongs</HI> run away also, and Col. <HI>Yeamonds</HI> troop moul∣ter away, and desert us extreamly; the enemy hath besieged what Garisons we have not slighted, Drogedan is in great danger of losing, many others will be lost, for we cannot flie from this City to help them without better store of Force for their relief. Col. <HI>Trevor</HI> hath likewise deserted us, and is gone to the enemy, where he entred into protestation to the Marquesse, declaring, <HI>That he would use all the interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possible he could, for the calling away of his Regiment, and the he was assured of their coming, with many othhrs also,</HI> the ene∣my continues drawing nearer this place, hindering all Mar∣kets, so that we are brought very low, every thing being ex∣traordinary dear, and the Inhabitants so taxed for support of the Souldiers, as that they will be undone. God in mercy look upon us, and help us.</P>

<P>Sir, We hear that the Royall par∣ty about Newark upon Trent hath lately proclaimed Prince <HI>Charles</HI> King of Great Brittain, France and Ireland, at the Marker place, and give out very high language against the present Authority of this Nation, saying, that they will have a King, and that they neither can nor will lye any longer un∣der the insupportable burthen of curelty, tyranny and op∣pression; but its hoped care will be taken for the allaying of the distempers of these troubled spirits, &amp; speedy course taken for the preventing of the like for the future.</P>
<P>By Letters from the West it is said, that the adverse party in Cornwall, have lately had a meeting neer Truro, where they declared their Resolutions for the proclaiming of Pr. Charles King, and to use all possible meanes for his restau∣ration; but its believed, that if they persist on in this treaso∣nable design, as the Parliament of England hath declared it, they will suddenly receive a Cornish hug.</P>
<P>We likewise hear, that a Squadron of the Princes ships hath fallen on the Northern Fleet, and that they have taken about 30 ships laden with comodities for London, and dis∣piersed the Convoy: this Victory (it's said) fell to Capt. Plunket (Rear Admirall to the Prince) who hath a gallant ship carrying 50 pieces of Ordnance, called <HI>The Mirrour of Dunkirk,</HI> formerly the King of Spain's Vice-admirall.</P>
<P>The K. of Denmark hath caused to be proclaimed through all his Dominions, <HI>That whosoever will take up Arms against the Parliament of England, they shall have free egresse and re∣gresse into his Harbours, and may freely secure within his Do∣minions any prize made vpon the English ships, belonging to the Parliament.</HI></P>
