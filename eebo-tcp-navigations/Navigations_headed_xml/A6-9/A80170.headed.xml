<P>THe Restitution and Establishment of your Honor∣able Society, promiseth and presageth no less then the future felicity of this Nation, the more or less disemboguings of <HI>Nilus</HI> could not be more infallible Sig∣nals of <HI>Egypts</HI> Exuberance or Indigence, then the greater or lesser enlargement of your Trade, is of the increase or decay of our Fame, Riches, and Strength.</P>
<P>You by penetrating those Oriental Coasts, will to our Clime in great measure restore the Golden Age; many poor being employed by your noble Adventures and Re∣turns, will escape the miseries of complaint and want.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Navy,</HI> as at present, it doth employ many able and experienced Sea-men, who possibly might otherwise languish under many discouragements, so we may assu∣redly promise to our selves the further encrease of their number in your Service.</P>
<P>That their Art and Knowledge might likewise be ad∣vanced and rendred more facil, as it should be the desire of all, so it hath been my particular aim and endeavor in the ensuing Treatise, which by that experience I have had amongst them, I guess not to be unsuitable to their de∣sires and spare hours, and though intended chiefly for
<PB REF="3"/> their benefit, yet may be of general use to every person, but especially to those that are Mathematically inclined. And now before whom can I more justly prostrate my En∣deavors in this kinde, then Your Honored Selves, whose re∣nowned Employments will exercise the choicest Results of this nature, which by how much the more serviceable they are rendred unto you, by so much the more will they become the Objects of Applause and Desire in others; Accept therefore this Offspring of some spare Hours improved, more with an intent for the Advance∣ment of the Publique good, then for any private benefit.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this my humble Address with a Tem∣poral and Spiritual Wish, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Encrease of your Treasures may answer your Hazards and Desires, and that your Vertues and Graces may exceed your Treasures in this Life; and in that to come, may your Glories as far transcend BOTH, as heaven does earth: And for this you have not onely the earnest Wishes, but the Cordial Prayers of</P>

<HEAD>To the Courteous Reader, whether Mariner or Student.</HEAD>
<P>HAving formerly spent some part of my time at Sea, I perceived the Genius and Inclination of most Mariners to be affected with drawing such Paper Schemes and Delineations of the Sphere, as might not onely represent the same to their fancy, but likewise suit the reso∣lution of such Spherique questions, as commonly they had occasion of; and finding a complaint amongst them of the want of a good Treatise of that kinde, I have often wished that some of our able Artists would display their endeavours to that purpose, wherein failing of my desire, and considering that some mean performances of this nature have for∣merly found good Acceptance with Seamen, as being suitable to the meanest Capacity, and performed by a Scale of small bulk and price, I thought fit to impart my Observations of that kinde, and certainly to the most learned it will be matter of use and delight, to see that what∣soever they can perform by exact Calculation, if their Tables be free from error, may be confirmed and performed without them, by the sole assistance of a pair of Compasses and a bare Ruler, and what great ease ensues, both in Navigation and Dyalling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by skill in carrying on of Proportions Geometrically, is scarcely as yet expected or apprehend∣ed by those who are strangers thereto.</P>
<P>If thou art just entring upon the Mathematicals, this Treatise may serve as an Introduction, in which after thou hast read to page <HI>20</HI> of the first Part, thou mayest apply thy self to the Spherical Definitions in the second Part, and there proceed, or else where, as shall be most suitable to thy desires. Thou wilt easily perceive that the right Angled Cases from page <HI>57</HI> to <HI>63,</HI> in the second Book, and also from page <HI>2</HI> to <HI>11</HI> in the third Book, might have been contrived in one general Scheme for each Book, but not so perspicuous to be understood: If this finde acceptance it will encourage me to be more laborious here∣after, and if thou reap benefit thereby, I have attained my desire, and that thou mayest so do, is the hearty wish of thy Well-willer and Friend,</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Containing Geometrical Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Point,</HI> is an imaginary Prick void of all length, breadth or depth.</P>
<P><HI>A Line,</HI> is a supposed Length without breadth or depth, the ends or limits whereof are Points.</P>
<P><HI>An Angle,</HI> derived from the word <HI>Angulus</HI> in Latine, which signifieth a Corner, is the inclination or bowing of two lines one to another, and the one touching the other, and not being directly joyned together.</P>
<P>If the Lines which contain the Angle be right Lines, then is it called a Right lined Angle.</P>
<P><HI>A right Angle,</HI> when a right Line standing upon a right Line, maketh the Angles on either side equal, each of these Angles are called Right Angles, and the Line erected is called a Perpendicu∣lar Line unto the other.</P>
<P><HI>An obtuse Angle,</HI> is that which is greater then a right Angle.</P>
<P><HI>An acute Angle,</HI> is that which is less then a right Angle, when tvvo Angles are both acute or obtuse, they are of the same kinde, othervvise are said to be of different affection.</P>
<P><HI>An Angle,</HI> is commonly denoted by the middlemost of the three Letters set to the sides, including the said Angle.</P>
<P>The quantity of an Angle is measured by the arch of a Circle, described upon the point of Concurrence or Intersection, where the two sides inclosing the said Angle, meet.</P>
<P>By the complement of an Arch or Angle, is meant the remain∣der of that Arch taken from 90<SUP>d</SUP>, unless it be expressed the com∣plement thereof to a Semicircle of 180<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<P><HI>A Circle,</HI> is a plain Figure contained under one Line, which is called the Circumference thereof, by some the Perimeter, Peri∣phery, or Limbe, a portion or part thereof is called a Segment.</P>
<P>The Center thereof is a Point in the very midst thereof, from which Point all right lines drawn to the Circumference are equal,
<PB N="2" REF="7"/> if divers Circles are described upon one and the same Center, they are said to be Concentrick, if upon divers Centers, they are in respect of each other said to be Excentrick.</P>
<P>The Diameter of a Circle is a right Line drawn through the Center of any Circle, in such sort that it may divide the whole Circle into two equal parts.</P>
<P>The Semidiameter of a Circle, commonly called the <HI>Radius</HI> thereof, is just one half of the Diameter, and is contained betwixt the Center and one side of the Circle.</P>
<P>A Semicircle is the one medeity or half of a whole Circle, de∣scribed upon the Diameter thereof.</P>
<P>And a Quadrant is just the one fourth of a whole Circle.</P>
<P>All Circles are supposed to be divided into 360 equal parts, called Degrees, consequently a Semicircle contains 180<SUP>d</SUP>, and a Quadrant 90<SUP>d</SUP>, and so much is the quantity of a right Angle.</P>
<P>A Minute is the sixtieth part of a degree, being understood of measure, but in time a Minute is the sixtieth part of an hour, or the fourth part of a degree, 15 degrees answering to an hour, and 4 Minutes to a degree. A Minute is marked thus 1′, a second is the sixtieth part of a Minute, marked thus 1″.</P>
<P>Where two lines or arches cross each other, the point of meet∣ing is called their Intersection, or their common Intersection.</P>

<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Let it be required to raise a Per∣pendicular upon the end of the Line C D, upon C as a Cen∣ter, describe the arch of a Circle as D G, prick the Extent of the Compasses from D to G, and up∣on G as a Center, with the said Extent, describe the ark D E G, in which prick down the Extent of the Compasses twice, first
<PB N="3" REF="7"/> from D to E, and then from E to F, then joyn the points F D with a right line, and it shall be the Perpendicular required.</P>

<P>Upon G with the Extent of the Compasses unvaried, describe a small portion of an Ark near F, then a Ruler laid over the Points C and G, will cut the said Ark at the Point F, from whence a line drawn to D, shall be the Perpendicular required.</P>
<P>In this latter case the Extent C F becomes the Secant of 60<SUP>d</SUP> to the Radius C D, which Secant is always equal to the double of the Radius.</P>
<P>As to the ground of the former Way, if the three Points C G F were joyned in a right line, it would be the Diameter of a Semi∣circle, an Angle in the circumference whereof made by lines, drawn from the extreamities of the Diameter, as doth the Angle C D F, is a right Angle by 31 <HI>Prop.</HI> 3 <HI>Book of</HI> Euclid.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>In Dyalling, to shun drawing of Lines on a Plain, it may be of frequent use to prick off an Angle by Sines or Tangents in stead of Chords, it will therefore be necessary to define these kinde of Lines.</P>
<P N="1"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>1. <HI>A Chord</HI> is a right line drawn in a Circle from one part of the Circum∣ference to another, thus G L is the Chord of the Arch G A L, as also of the Arch G B L, also A B the Dia∣meter, is the Chord of the Semicircle A D B and A K B: now for the ready pricking off of any Arch, there may be one quadrant of a Circle divided into nine equal parts, or a whole Semicircle into 18 equal parts,
<PB N="11" REF="11"/> and one of those parts below the Diameter into ten Sub-divisions, but if you divide the Arch B D into 90 equal parts, then setting one foot of a pair of Compasses in B, extend the other to each de∣gree of the said Arch, and transfer those extents into the line B C, as we have done, for every tenth degree to 60 degrees, and it shall be a Line of Chords, which may be continued further at pleasure.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The right Sine</HI> of an Arch is half the Chord of twice that Arch: thus G F being the half of G L, is the Sine of the Arch, G A half of the Arch G A L, whence it follows that the right Sine of an Arch less then a quadrant, is also the right Sine of that Arks residue from a Semicircle, because, as was shewed above, the Chord of an Ark is the same both to an Ark lesser then a quadrant, and to its complement to a Semicircle.</P>
<P>What an Arch wants of a quadrant, is called the Complement thereof: thus the Arch D G is the Complement of the Arch A G, and H G is the Sine of the Arch D G, or which is all one, it is the Cosine of the Arch A G, and the Line H G being equal to C F, it follows that the right Sine of the Complement of an Arch is equal to that part of the Diameter, which lieth between that Arch and the Center.</P>
<P>From the former Scheme also follows another Definition of a right Sine, as namely, that it is a right Line falling from one end of any Arch perpendicularly upon the Radius, drawn to the other end of the said Arch, so is G F perpendicular to C A, being the Sine of the Arch G A; likewise A I falls perpendicularly on C G, therefore by the same definition is also the Sine of the said Arch.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Versed Sine</HI> of an Arch is that part of the Diameter which lieth between the right Sine of that Arch and the Circumfe∣rence: thus F A is the Versed Sine of the Arch G A, and F B the Versed Sine of the Arch B D G.</P>
<P N="4">4. If unto one end of an Arch there be drawn a Radius, and to the other end a right line from the Center, cutting the Circle, and if from the end of the Radius a Perpendicular be raised till it meet with the Line cutting the Circle, that Perpendicular is the Tangent of that Arch: thus A E is the Tangent of the Arch G A, and D M is the Cotangent of the said Ark, namely, it is the Tangent of the Arch H G, which is the Complement of the former Arch.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="12"/>5. The aforesaid right Line cutting the Circle, is called the Secant of the said Arch: thus C E is the Secant of the Arch G A, and C M is the Cosecant of the said Arch, for it is the Secant of the Arch D G.</P>
<P N="6">6. Assigning the Radius C A to be an unit with Ciphers at pleasure, to define or express the quantities of these respective lines, in relation to the Arches to which they belong, were to make a Table of natural Sines, Tangents and Secants; of which at large see Mr. <HI>Newtons Trigonometria Brittanica,</HI> for abbreviate ways, and something we shall adde about it in the Arithmetical part of Navigation.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Tables being made, their chief use was to work the Rule of Three, or Golden Rule Arithmetically, by multiplying the se∣cond and third tearms of any Proportion, and dividing by the first, and thereby to resolve all Propositions relating either to Plain or Spherical Triangles, which in lines is performed by drawing a line parallel to the Side of a Triangle, and where four tearms either in Sines, Tangents, Secants, Versed Sines, are expressed, as the first to the second, so is the third to the fourth, it implyes a Propor∣tion, and that the second and third tearm are to be multiplyed to∣gether, and the Product divided by the first.</P>
<P>The proportion or reason of two numbers, or reference of one to the other, is measured by the Quotient, the one being divided by the other.</P>
<P><HI>A Proportion</HI> is then said to be direct, when the third tearm bears such proportion to the fourth, as the first to the second: four num∣bers are said to be proportional when as often as the first and se∣cond are the one contained in the other, so often are the third and fourth the one contained in the other.</P>
<P><HI>Reciprocal Proportion</HI> is when the fourth tearm bears such Pro∣portion to the third, as the first doth to the second.</P>
<P><HI>A Proportion</HI> is said to hold <HI>alternately,</HI> when the second and third tearms thereof change places, and <HI>inversly,</HI> when the order of the tearms are so altered, that one of the three first tearms shall become the last.</P>
<P>Divers Proportions are expressed in this following Book, which if the Reader would apply to Tables, he must understand that when a Side or an Angle is greater then a Quadrant, that in stead of the
<PB N="13" REF="12"/> Sine, Tangent, or Secant of such an Ark, he must take the Sine, Tangent, or Secant of that Arks complement to a Semicircle.</P>
<P>That the words <HI>Cosine</HI> or <HI>Cotangent</HI> of an Arch given or sought, signifie the Sine or Tangent of the Complement of the Arch given or sought.</P>
<P>That the Cosine or Cotangent of an Arch greater then a Qua∣drant, is the Sine or Tangent of the excess of that Arch above a Quadrant, or 90 degrees.</P>
<P N="8">8. What trouble the Ancients were at in resolving of Propor∣tions by Multiplication and Division, is wonderfully abbreviated by an admirable Invention called <HI>Logarithmes,</HI> where by framing and substituting other numbers in stead of the former, Multiplica∣tion is changed into Addition, and Division into Substraction; of which also see the former Book <HI>Trigonometria Brittanica.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. What may be performed by either of the former kindes of Tables, may also with a Line of Chords and equal parts be per∣formed, but not so near the truth, without them, and that either by projecting or representing the Sphere on a Flat or Plain, as we have handled in the second and third Part, or by Protracting and Delineating of such Proportions as may be wrought by the Ta∣bles: and this in some measure is the intended subject of our sub∣sequent Discourse.</P>
<P N="10">10. Therefore before we proceed any further, it will be neces∣sary to describe such Lines as are upon the Scale, intended to be treated of.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Description of the Scale in the Frontispiece.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The first or uppermost line is a line of a Chords, numbred to 180 degrees, and is called the Lesser Chord, being a double Scale, the undermost side whereof being numbred with half those Arks, is a line of Sines and is called the greater Sines; at the end of this Scale stands another little Scale, which is called the lesser Sines, being numbred with 90 degrees, and both these Scales seem to be one continued Scale.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Scale is another line of Chords, called the grea∣ter Chord, being fitted to the same Radius with the greater Sine, and numbred to 90 degrees.</P>
<P>Annexed thereto is a single Line called the line of Rumbes or
<PB N="14" REF="13"/> Points of the Compass, numbred from 1 to 8, in which each Rum∣be is divided into quarters, having pricks or full points set thereto.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Scale is a line of equal parts or leagues, divided into ten greater divisions, and each of those parts into ten smaller divisions, and each of those smaller divisions into halfs.</P>
<P>Annexed thereto is another Scale of six equal parts, each of which parts is sub-divided as the former.</P>
<P>How to make a Line of Chords or Sines from the equal divisi∣ons of the Circle, is spoke to in the second Book, <HI>page</HI> 2. The Scale thus described is indeed a double Scale, for it hath two Lines of Chords, two Lines of Sines, and two Lines of equal Parts up∣on it, and this rather for conveniency then necessity, whereas in∣deed one of each kinde had been sufficient, yea, the Sines might have been wholly spared; for throughout these Treatises nothing is more required of necessity, then a Circle divided into equal parts, as in the third Book, <HI>page</HI> 4. and a right Line divided into equal parts, which we suppose in every mans power to do if he have Compasses. The Schemes throughout these Books are fit∣ted either to the Radius of the greater or lesser Chord before de∣scribed, that is to say, they are drawn with 60 degrees of the one or the other of those Lines of Chords.</P>

<P>This Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> doth not make a Case, because an Angle must be first found and determined before the third Side can be found, and then it will be resolved by the following Case.</P>

<HEAD><HI>3.</HI> Two Angles with a Side opposite to one of them given, to finde the Side opposed to the other.</HEAD>
<P>In this Case the third Angle is also given, as being the comple∣ment of the sum of the two former Angles to a Semicircle. As if there were given the Side A B in the former Triangle, the Angle B A C, and the Angle A C B.</P>
<P>First prick off the Side A B, then substract the sum of the Angles B A C, and A C B, from 180<SUP>d</SUP> or a Semicircle, and there re∣mains the Angle A B C, then upon A as a Center, set off upon the Arch D F the measure of the Angle A.</P>
<P>Also upon B as a Center, the measure of that Angle must be set off, and lines drawn through the extreamities of those Arks will meet, as at C, the point that limits the two Sides A C, and B C, which are to be measured on the equal parts: By this Case if A C were the Wall of a Town, and B a Fort shooting into the said Town, the distance of the said Fort might be found from any part of the Town wall, without going out to measure it; for first, with any whole circle or a compass, observe the Arch between A B
<PB N="20" REF="16"/> and A C, and measure the distance C A, again at A observe the Arch between A B and A C, and protract as in this Example, and you may measure the distance between B and any point in the line A C; And so if B were a Tower or Mark on the land, and A C represent the Ships distance in her course, by observing how B bears both at A and C, the Ships distance therefrom might be measured.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>Two other general ways for working Proportions in Sines.</HEAD>
<P>Let the Proportion be:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 70<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 50<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 35<SUP>d</SUP>. <HI>To what Sine? Answer:</HI> 27<SUP>d</SUP>, 50′.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Having drawn the Quadrant D E with 60<SUP>d</SUP> of the Chords, and its two Radii D C, C E at right Angles in the Center, prick down from the Chords one of the middle tearms, to wit, 35<SUP>d</SUP> from D to H, and draw a line into the Center, and upon the said line from the Center to A, prick down out of the Sines the other mid∣dle tearm, to wit, 50<SUP>d</SUP>, and through the Point A draw the line A B parallel to D C, then count the first tearm from D to G 70<SUP>d</SUP>, and draw a line from the Center which passeth through A B at F, and the extent C F measured on the Sines, is 27<SUP>d</SUP> 50′ the fourth Proportional, and thus the first tearm may be varied as much as you please.</P>
<P><HI>Otherwise:</HI></P>
<P>Place the Sine of the first tearm, to wit, of 70<SUP>d</SUP>, which in this Example is the nearest distance from G to D C so from the Cen∣ter, that it may cross A B produced when need requires: In this Example it crosseth it at I, a ruler over the Center and the point I,
<PB N="23" REF="17"/> cuts the Limbe at K, and the Arch D K being 27<SUP>d</SUP> 50′, is the measure of the fourth Proportional, as before.</P>
<P>When it cannot be there placed, to wit, as when the Sine of the first tearm is shorter then C B, the fourth Proportional is more then the Radius, and the Arch of the first tearm being counted from D towards E, a line from the Center meeting with A B produced, shall be the Secant of the fourth Proportional to the common Radius of the Quadrant.</P>
<P>The Demonstration of this Scheme is inferred from varying the Proportion, which may stand thus, by changing the two first tearms into their complements, and altering their order they be∣come Secants.</P>
<P><HI>As the Secant of</HI> 55<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>to Secant</HI> 20<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 50<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 27<SUP>d</SUP> 50′.</P>
<P>If C B be made Radius, then is C A the Secant of 55<SUP>d</SUP> to the same Radius, and it is also by construction the Sine of 50<SUP>d</SUP> to the common Radius, then from the proportion of equality, because the first tearm is equal to the third, the second tearm C F being the Secant of 20<SUP>d</SUP> to the lesser Radius, is also the Sine of the fourth Proportional to the common Radius, this suitable to the former of those directions, the latter carries on this Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 50<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>to Sine of</HI> 70<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>So is the Secant of</HI> 55<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>to the Secant of</HI> 62<SUP>d</SUP> 10′.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A third, being the common Geometrical way of working all Pro∣portions in Lines, is by drawing a Line parallel to the Side of a Plain Triangle.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Thus from the for∣mer Scheme make C A the Secant of 55<SUP>d</SUP> to the lesser Radius, and C H the Sine of 50<SUP>d</SUP> to the common Radius, and joyne A H; also make C F the Secant of 20<SUP>d</SUP>, and draw F G parallel to A H, then because A C is equal
<PB N="24" REF="18"/> to H C, therefore F C shall be equal to G C, wherefore the Sine of the fourth Proportional is equal to the Secant of the se∣cond Proportional, which is the foundation of the former Scheme; which form of Operation holds generally, though by reason of ex∣cursions we shall pursue other forms of Operation more speedy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another way for working Proportions in Sines with a Line of Chords onely.</HEAD>
<P>Let the Proportion be:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 30<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 18<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 23<SUP>d</SUP>. <HI>To what Sine? Answer is,</HI> 14<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<P>If a Line of Sines be wanting, it may be observed that a Line of Chords will supply the defect thereof, by doubling the three first tearms, and you will for the fourth tearm finde the Chord of twice the Arch sought, the half whereof is the Arch sought.</P>
<P>The three tearms of the former Proportion doubled, are 60<SUP>d</SUP>, 36<SUP>d</SUP>, 46<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Draw the line A B, and therein prick down the Chord of 60 de∣grees from A to B, upon which Point, with the Chord of 36 de∣grees, describe the Ark C, and draw a line from A just touching the outward extreamity of it, then prick down the Chord of 46 degrees from A to D, the nearest distance from it to the line A C, is the Chord of 28 degrees, the half whereof be∣ing 14 degrees, is the fourth Proportional Sine sought.</P>
<P>It will be convenient to describe the Ark C always with the least of the three tearms, and this kinde of Operation is best when the two first tearms of the Proportion are fixed.</P>
<P>If the Proportion had been of the less to the greater:</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of</HI> 36<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>is to the Sine of</HI> 60<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>So is the Sine of</HI> 14<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>to the Sine of</HI> 23<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="18"/>
<P>In this case the Chord of 28 degrees must be so entred on the line A B, that on foot resting thereon, the other turned about should but just touch the line A C, the foot of the Compasses would rest at D, and the extent D A, being the Chord of 46 de∣grees, the half thereof 23 degrees, is the fourth Proportional sought.</P>
<P>This way was chiefly added, to shew the manner of Proportion∣ing out of any line to a lesser Radius, for here A B being the common Radius, and the extent wherewith the ark C was descri∣bed another lesser Radius, the nearest distance from D to A C, shal be the Chord of 46 degrees to the said lesser Radius.</P>

<P>Then place the arch A L from B to G, and the nearest distance from G to E D is the difference of the versed Sines of the third tearm of the Proportion; it is also by reason of the Proportion of equality, the versed Sine of the Azimuth from the North, which

<P>The like Operation holds for South Declination, onely then the Chord of the Polar distance is greater then 90<SUP>d</SUP> by the Suns decli∣nation.</P>
<P>If the Sun have Depression, the Sine of it must be pricked up∣ward above L in the Latitude Line, and then as before.</P>

<P>In following Schemes we shall finde the hour from Noon from the Point A, also the Azimuth from the South may be found from the same Point, and possibly with more convenience in regard the Intersections may not happen so oblique, and that upon this consideration, that whatsoever Altitude the Sun hath in any Signe upon any Azimuth from the north, he hath the like De∣pression in the Opposite Sign upon the like Azimuth counted from the South.</P>
<P>Wherefore retaining the former construction, L N the Sine of the Altitude, which in the former Scheme was placed down∣wards, in this following Scheme place upwards.</P>

<P>This is a Scheme of much worth, in regard it requires the draw∣ing of no new Lines till the Latitude vary. In South Latitudes when the Altitude is very great, the intersections of the prickt Arks will fall near the Center, in that case let the Altitude and Latitude change Names, and fit the Scheme thereto: Here note, that the three points M C S are the angular points of the Sides of a plain Triangle, &amp; if those Sides be doubled (doubling the sine M C outward beyond M) the intersection at S which now hap¦pens within the Semicircle, would happen without and beyond it: The foundation of this Scheme shall afterwards be suggested.</P>

<HEAD>The Azimuth Compass in the Frontispiece described.</HEAD>
<P>It is supposed to be made of a square Board, on which there is a Circle described which is cut out through: the Line N S represents a thread, upon the Point N as a Center placed in the Circum∣ference, there moveth a Labell or Triangle represented by N S A, the Side N A is supposed to stand Perpendicular, and to have a Slit in it, the line S A is to be a thread extended from S to A, the other side of which Triangle resembles a Moveable Toung or Labell, the Center being in the Circumference, every degree is twice as large as it would be, if it were at the Center, wherefore the quadrants S E, S W, are numbred with 45<SUP>d</SUP> on each side the
<PB N="38" REF="25"/> Line N S, but are not divided with concentrick Circles and Dia∣gonals, nor can they be with truth when ever the Center is placed in the Circumference, and this I call <HI>an Azimuth Compass,</HI> because though it be not so, yet it supplies the use of one, and if a right line be continued from N to E, and made a line of Sines; also a Tan∣gent of 45<SUP>d</SUP> put through the Limbe, it, or an Azimuth Compass, is rendred general, without the use of Paper-draughts, as I have shewed in the Uses of the smallest Quadrant in my Treatise, <HI>The Sector on a Quadrant,</HI> Page 277 to 284. where the Reader will meet with ready Proportions for Calculating the Suns Azimuth or true Coast, not before published.</P>
<P>The Use of the said Azimuth Compass at Sea, is readily to ap∣ply it to any Compass in the Ship, and thereby finde the true Coast of the Suns bearing by that Compass to which it is applyed, and consequently the Variation thereof, and by my own experi∣ence I have often found, that by the thread which passeth through the Diameter of the said A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imuth Compass, it may very well by the View be placed over the Meridian line of the Compass, and then turning the moveable Label towards the Sun, so that the shadow of the thread may pass thorough the Slit, the tongue of the Label, amongst the graduations of the Limbe, shewes how the Sun bears by the said Compass, in which the toucht wires is supposed to be precisely under the <HI>Flower-deluce,</HI> &amp; when the Sun is more then 45<SUP>d</SUP> from the Meridian either way, the thread in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iameter of the Circle must be placed by the view over the East or West point of the Compass, and the Suns bearing accordingly reckoned from thence.</P>
<P>Then admiting that the bearing of the Sun by the Compass and his true Azimuth or Coast of bearing, be found either by Calcula∣tion or the former Schemes, the Variation of the said Compass from the North (which all Needles are lyable unto) with the Coast thereof may thus be found.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI></P>
<P>Let the bearing of the Sun by the Compass be 55<SUP>d</SUP> East-ward from the South, and his true coast in the Heavens be 43<SUP>d</SUP> ¾ from the South East-wards.</P>
<P>Having upon C with 60 degrees of the Chords, described the Circle S W N E, prick 55 degrees the Suns coast by the Compass

</FIGURE> from S to ⊙, and draw ⊙ C, then place 43<SUP>d</SUP> ¾ the Suns true coast from ⊙ to A, and A is the true South Point, and B opposite thereto the North Point, and the Arch S A sheweth that the Compass varieth 11 degrees and a quarter from the South West∣ward; or, which is all one, the Arch B M sheweth it to vary as much from the North East-ward, because the Point N falleth to the Eastward of B.</P>
<P>Then admit it were required to steer the Ship away N E by E, being the fifth point from the North East-ward, it is desired to know how she must wind or steer by that Compass. Out of the Scale of Rumbes place five point from B to R, then measure the extent N R on the Rumbes, and it sheweth four points, whence we may conclude th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to make good the former Course, the Ship must be steered North-east by this Compass.</P>

<HEAD>Demonstration.</HEAD>
<P>This Scheme I first met with in a Map made in <HI>Holland,</HI> the foundation whereof was long since laid by <HI>Copernicus</HI> and <HI>Regiomon∣tanus,</HI> who from a right lined plain Triangle, happening at the Center of the Sphere, have prescribed a Method of Calculation for finding an Angle when three Sides are given: Here we shall illustrate the Converse, how from two Sides and the Angle com∣prehended, to find the third Side.</P>
<P>From any two points in the Sphere, suppose Perpendiculars to fall on the plain of the Equator here represented by AE L Q M, which Perpendiculars are the Sines of the Latitudes of those two Points, and the distance of the points in the Plain of the Equino∣ctial from the Center of the Sphere, are the Cosines of those Lati∣tudes, &amp; the angle at the Center between those points in the plain of the Equator, is equal to the arch of the Equinoctial between the two Meridians, passing through the supposed Points in the Sphere: now a right line extended in the Sphere between any two Points, is the Chord of the Ark of distance between those Points.</P>
<P>Understand then, that the three Points A, C, B, limit the Sides of a righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lined Triangle in the Plain of the Equator, where∣of the Angle A C B is at the Center, then the extent A B is placed from A to E, if then we draw D E G perpendicular to A Q, and place B I from E to G and D, the extent L G shall be the Chord of the third Side when the places are in different Hemi∣spheres, and the extent L D is the Chord of their distance when they are in the same Hemisphere.</P>
<P>And if the extent E D, E G, be placed from L to H and K, the line D E G need not be drawn, because the extent L G and L D, if it be rightly conceived, are the two very Points at first supposed in the Sphere, the extent A B as to matter of Calculation, being one Side of a plain Triangle right angled. The sum or difference of the Sines of both Latitudes the other Side, and the Chord of the distance is the Hipotenusal, or third Side sought.</P>
<P>Thus the Ancients by Calculation, and we by Protraction, ha∣ving two Sides and the Angle comprehended given, find the third Side; or having three Sides given, find the Angle opposite to that Side which in the Scheme is measured by a Chord, as by result from the three Sides there will be got the two extents A E
<PB N="46" REF="29"/> and C B, and consequently the Intersection at B, and thence the Angle AE M, which before was insisted on in finding the Azimuth and Hour, by the like reason the Distances of Stars may be found from their Longitudes and Latitudes, or from their Declinations and right Ascensions. Divers other Schemes from other Proporti∣ons might be added for finding the Hour and Azimuth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which which I am loth to trouble the Reader withal.</P>

<P>Having described a Semicircle, and divided it into halfs by the Perpendicular H C, prick the Latitude from S to L, and draw L A parallel to S N, and proportion out the Sine of 30<SUP>d</SUP> to the Radius L A, and prick it from A to 30<SUP>d</SUP>, upon which point with the Sine of the Declination, describe a prickt Circle, and a ruler from the Center just touching the outward extreamities of it, cuts the Limbe at T and K: Here note, that H C is the Horizontal line and any Ark counted from H towards K is Altitude, but to∣wards N is Depression; so in this Example the Arch H K being 49<SUP>d</SUP> 56′, is the Altitude for 30<SUP>d</SUP> of Azimuth to the South∣wards of the East and West for North Declination, and the Arch H T being 6<SUP>d</SUP> 36′, is the Suns Depression under the Horizon for the same Azimuth, when his Declination is 23<SUP>d</SUP> 31′ South.</P>
<P>It is also his Altitude for 30<SUP>d</SUP> of Azimuth to the North-wards of the East or West, when his Declination is 23<SUP>d</SUP> 31′ North, because
<PB N="48" REF="30"/> if we place A 30<SUP>d</SUP> as much on the other side the Vertical at M, and with the Sine of the Declination describe an Ark at <HI>f,</HI> a ruler from the Center will cut the Limbe as much on this side H, as T is on the other side.</P>
<P>If the prickt Circle had hapned wholly on one side C H, a ruler from the Center touching its extreamities, and cutting the out∣ward Circle in two points, that nearest unto H had been the Altitude to the assigned Azimuth for South Declination, and the remotest for North Declination.</P>
<P>And if one Side of the prickt Circle happens below S C, as it may do both for the Sun or Stars, when their Declination is more then the Latitude of the place, then the Quadrant H S. must be continued to a Semicircle, and H C must be also produced, and the Altitude counted above the other end of the said Horizontal Line.</P>
<P>If the ruler should touch the prickt Circle near the Center, let it be noted that C 30<SUP>d</SUP> is the Radius, and the extent that described the prickt Circle, is a Sine of an Ark to that Radius; whence it followes, that a right angled Triangle may be framed, and the answer given in the Limbe, as we have often done before. See the last Scheme for finding the Amplitude.</P>
<P>The Demonstration of this Scheme, is founded not onely on the Analemma, as I have said in the Second Part, but likewise on those Proportions, whereby the Suns Altitudes are Calculated on all Azimuths.</P>
<P>The first Proportion finds the Equinoctial / Altitude proper to the given Azimuth, and is:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: To the Cotangent of the Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of any Azimuth from the Vertical:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of the Equinoctial Altitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P>In the former Scheme L A is the Radius of a line of Sines, it is also the Cotangent of the Latitude, if we make C A Radius.</P>
<P>Then because of the Proportion of Equality in the two first tearmes, it followes that the sine of the Azimuth from the Vertical A 30<SUP>d</SUP>, to the Radius L A, is also the Tangent of the Equinoctial Altitude, making C A Radius, wherefore a ruler over C 30<SUP>d</SUP> cuts the Limbe at B, and the Ark H B being 21<SUP>d</SUP> 40′, is the Equinoctial Altitude sought.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="30"/>
<P>The next Proportion is:</P>
<P><HI>As the sine of the Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Cosine of the Equinoctial Altitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the sine of the Declination:</HI></P>

<P>In the former Scheme if C 30<SUP>d</SUP> be Radius, 30<SUP>d</SUP> A is the sine of the Equinoctial Altitude, and C A is the Cosine thereof, which is also the sine of the Latitude to the common Radius, then by rea∣son of the Proportion of equality in the two first tearms, it follows that the sine of the Declination to the common Radius being the third tearme, is also the sine of the fourth Arch sought, C 30<SUP>d</SUP> being Radius, and the summing or differencing of the two Arks, is performed by describing the prickt Circle, and laying a ruler from the Center touching its Extreamities, after this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner a Scheme is contrived from Proportions, to find the third Side, having two Sides with an angle opposite to one of them given.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Art of Navigation.</HEAD>
<P>THe end of this Art, is to shew how a Ship is to be steered and guided, that at length she may arrive at the desi∣red Port.</P>
<P>The Imperfections and Defects of this Art are many, partly in the skill or theorick, partly in the practice.</P>
<P>In the first Principles, or in the Theorick, a great defect is, that the true Longitudes of Places are not yet known, and unless the true Longitudes and Latitudes of Places be known, their true Courses and Distances cannot be found, whence it will unavoi∣dably follow, that no true reckoning can be kept.</P>
<P>After a long Voyage, when a Ship is supposed to be a compe∣tent distance, or not very far off the main Land, it is a usual cu∣stom of the Master to require from his Mates an account of their judgement concerning the bearing and distance of some Cape or Head-land which they may make, or gain sight of, and in the event he that gives the best judgement, is supposed to have kept the best reckoning; and this may be admitted of, provided they were all at first agreed concerning the true Course and Distance of the Place they shall first espie, from that place from which they were bound, otherwise a bad reckoning in the result may prove better then a good one, in respect of the uncertainty in the Longitude: I suppose Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> and others have made such grie∣vous Complaints as these.</P>
<P>That there is 150 or 200 Leagues error in the distance between the <HI>Bay of Mexico</HI> and the <HI>Azores,</HI> and in some Charts about 600 Leagues error in the distance between <HI>Cape Mendosino</HI> and <HI>Cape California,</HI> which great errors are partly to be ascribed to the uncertainty of Longitude, and partly to the Plain Chart, which makes Places far more distant then they would be, and situated much out of their true Rumbe.</P>
<P>Another uncertainty there is in keeping the Ship steered upon
<PB N="2" REF="36"/> the true Rumbe, albeit it were known, for the Wyres of the Needle being touched by the Load-stone, are subject to be drawn aside by any Iron near it, and liable to variation, and doth not shew the true North and South, which ought continually to be observed and allowed for, as I have said.</P>
<P>And moreover in one and the same Region or Place, doth not exactly shew the same Rumbe or Course, as is well known to Dyallists, by their Experiments in observing the Situation of a Wall; thereby <HI>Maetius</HI> saith, he sometimes found a degree or two difference, and Mr. <HI>Gunter</HI>'s Experiments at <HI>Limehouse,</HI> for finding the variation, made it in some places of the same ground more by half a degree then in other places, and in some other places less, which may be thus illustrated.</P>
<P>Let a Sea-Compass, or rather a Box and Needle, be fastened upon a Surveying Instrument, so that the Needle may exactly point to some mark or graduation in the Box, whereto it may be afterwards set, and then looking through the Sights of the Instru∣ment, observe what mark, as Tree, Tower, Building, or the like, appears in view to the eye, and if there be no such mark, then a Staff may be set up at a competent distance, then move the Field-Instrument round, that the Needle may totter and be unsetled, but the Sights not altered, and afterwards in the same place let it settle it self to point out the very same Point or mark in the Box, as it did before, then if you look through the former sights, the mark set up will not appear in the same visual line to the eye, as before, but on one side or the other.</P>
<P>And if there be so much uncertainty on the firm Land; how much more in the floating Sea, where the Ship may be carried a∣way with secret and unknown Currents; for the finding out whereof it will be necessary for the Masters and Mates when they see any Island or Land, to observe which way the ripples of water use to set: It will also be very advantagious to observe the usual customs of the Winds, called <HI>A Trade Wind,</HI> which many times causeth the Sea to have a Course or Current therewith, as <HI>Maetius</HI> instanceth by an Example between <HI>Brasilia</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> in the op∣posite Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>From the tenth of <HI>April</HI> to the tenth of <HI>July,</HI> the Current sets North-west.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="36"/>
<P>From the tenth of <HI>July</HI> to the tenth of <HI>October,</HI> it seems to have no motion.</P>
<P>From the tenth of <HI>October</HI> to the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> it sets South∣west.</P>
<P>And from the tenth of <HI>January</HI> to the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> it seems to have no motion again.</P>
<P>Another Instance of the uncertainty in a reckoning by reason of Currents, may be taken from <HI>Davis</HI> his <HI>Streights,</HI> where the Sea flows with such a violent, secret, or undiscerned force, that those which steer from thence East by the Compass, do finde they have made their Course South-east, which is a sufficient Instance of the danger and uncertainty of Navigation, for when a Ship steers but one Rumbe, or 11<SUP>d</SUP> ¼ from the true Course, in the space of an hundred Leagues, she shall fall wide of expectation almost ten Leagues, or 1/10 of the distance, which in four Rumbes error will amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to about 70 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>The Estimation</HI> of the distance sailed, for the most part depends upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he judgement, albeit when the Course is directly under the Meridian, it may be known by Observation of the difference of Latitude, if we suppose the true quantity of the measure of a degree on the Surface of the eatrh to be agreed upon, and hereby Estimation ought to be rectified, which otherwise is helped and furthered by the Log-line; the uncertainty whereof by Currents is so great, that <HI>Maetius</HI> instanceth, that an expert Master being bound to the <HI>Isle of St. Helens</HI> in the midst of the Sea, in 16<SUP>d</SUP> of South Latitude, and having got into the parallel or Latitude there∣of, thinking to make it Eastward, was notwithstanding carried by the hidden Motion or Current of the Sea about 800 Miles West∣ward, till he found himself near <HI>America</HI> or <HI>Brasilia,</HI> and yet notwithstanding stemmed the Current with a fair Wind: And <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellius</HI> instanceth that a Navigator of good repute failing out of <HI>Holland,</HI> twice mist the <HI>Maderas,</HI> and returned home to the great dammage of the Owners.</P>
<P>And where such Currents are if you stem them, the distance run will be less then it is by Estimation, but if you sayl with them, it will be much more, and proportionally it will be less or more, if you cross it eitheir directly or obliquely, according as it sets with or against your intended Course.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="37"/>
<P><HI>Lastly, the observation of the Latitude</HI> (being the sole help whereby to rectifie an erronious reckoning) cannot be performed so near the truth, but that divers minutes of error may be committed, as <HI>Suellius</HI> instanceth, that six several persons at the same time in one Ship, who were accustomed to Observations, and who for the most part of them had been more then once at the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies,</HI> observing the latitude, found it to be by their several observations:

<P>Whereto we may adde, that the Refraction of the Sun, especially in Winter, makes his Altitude or Height seem greater then it is, which is caused by the gross va∣pours and thickness of the Air near the Horizon, this we may allude to after this manner: Set down an empty Bason on a Stool, laying a shilling at the bottom thereof, and go so much backwards, till you bring the edge of the Bason and the shilling in a right line with your Eye, and then let another fill the Bason with fair water, and you may go a pretty way further backward, and still see the shilling and the edge of the Bason in a right line, the refraction of the water being the cause thereof; and from this Reason we conclude, That the Sun seems to appear above the Horizon when he is really set.</P>
<P>This is confirmed also by many Experiments, we may recite one: A certain Dutch Ship being upon the Discovery of a North∣east passage to the <HI>East-India,</HI> was constrained to winter in the Island of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> where after the Sun had been for divers moneths under the Horizon, the Mariners beheld the whole body of the Sun iust above the Horizon 14 days sooner then according to his Declination he should appeare, and by Computation was then at least 5 degrees under the Horizon; Also at other times, especially in winter, he appears to be higher then he is, for which there are Tables of Allowance, as also for the Parralax and height of the eye in <HI>Mr. Wrights Correction of Errors in Navigation,</HI> wherefore those that come from the South-wards, expecting to fall in with the <HI>Lands-end,</HI> or <HI>Lizard,</HI> are to be admonished that in trusting to the Observed Latitude, they do not estimate themselves more to the Southwards then really they are, and so incur danger through presumption; but this erro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is somewhat abated by the
<PB N="5" REF="37"/> height of the eye above the water, observing the Sun with <HI>Davis</HI> his Quadrant backward in a Horizon more northwardly then the true one: Notwithstanding the imperfections and uncertainties that arise in the practick part, yet it should be our endeavour to render this excellent Art as easie and certain as we can, which is the thing I aim at, and the Instrument here used being the <HI>Plaine Scale,</HI> is, as I said before, in every mans power, if he have Com∣passes.</P>

<P>BY a <HI>Plain Chart,</HI> is meant a Chart drawn on Paper or Paste∣board, lined with Meridians and Parallels, making right An∣gles each with other, and numbred with degrees both of Lati∣tude and Longitude, each equal to other, and what is commonly performed in casting up a Traverse on such a Chart, we shall per∣form on a Blank of Paper.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Course,</HI> in a familiar sense, is meant that point of the Compass or Coast of the Horizon on which the Ship is to be steer∣ed from place to place.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Rumbe</HI> is in effect the same thing with the <HI>Course,</HI> and is defined to be a Line, described by the Ships motion on the sur∣face of the Sea, steered by the Compass, making the same Angles with every Meridian, the properties of which Line shall after∣wards be handled; and whereas every Rumbe maketh with the Meridian both an acute and obtuse Angle, by the Angle of the Rumbe is meant the acute Angle.</P>

<P>We have here added in a Print of the Compass and its Winds, each Quadrant being divided into ninety degrees, and so may serve in stead of another Line of Chords, and those that are de∣sirous may have these Prints upon loose Papers, and paste them on upon a Board, and so a quarter of it may serve for a Tra∣verse-Quadrant, or in pricking down of Courses the common way, in stead of pricking down every Course from the Meridian,
<PB N="7" REF="38"/> they may hereby prick off every following Course from the for∣mer Course last sayled upon, without any respect to the Meridian at all.</P>

<P>Having made the following Scheme like a Square, the Sides L T and T D being at right angles, let T represent <HI>Tenariff,</HI> prick the difference of Latitude, which is 11<SUP>d</SUP> out the greater Scale of equal part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which is graduated on the Sides of this Scheme from T to L, and the difference of Longitude, which is 8<SUP>d</SUP> from T to D, and with that extent upon L, describe a prickt Ark near N, and with the extent T L upon D, describe ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her prickt Ark, crossing the former: where these Arks cross as at N, is the place of <HI>St. Ni∣cholas Island,</HI> draw the line T N, and the Angle L T N shewes the Course from the Meridian, to measure it, with 60<SUP>d</SUP> of the Chords draw the arch R S, which measured on the Scale of prickt Rumbes, annexed to the greater Chord, shews that <HI>St. Nicholas Isle</HI> bears from <HI>Tenariff</HI> 3 points and a little more then a quarter to the Westward of the South, that is, South West and by South, a quarter Westwardly, and this prickt Ark need not be drawn, all that is required is the distance between the points R, S, which may be found without drawing any such Arch at all, for the nearest di∣stance

<P>Lastly, the extent T N measured on the same equal parts, sheweth the distance to be 13<SUP>d</SUP> 59 Centesms, and when this di∣stance is too large to be measured on the Scale, you may take ten degrees, and turn it over as many times as you can, and after∣wards measure the remaining part of the distance by it self.</P>

<P>Here it is to be noted, that we have found the distance in de∣grees, and Centesimals or hundredth parts of a degree, which be∣ing a general common measure to all the world, may afterwards be reduced into the Leagues or Miles of any Countrey whatso∣ever. Now before we reduce this to our English measure, I will first shew what is the usual custom of expressing the Course and Distance on a Ships Log-board at Sea, and then how in effect the same custom may be still retained or altered, and yet either way agree with the Truth.</P>

<P><HI>The second for the Ships Course.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The third for the Knots.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The fourth for the Half-knots.</HI></P>
<P>Our English or Italian Mile by which we reckon at Sea, contains 1000 paces, and each pace five foot, and every foot 12 inches. The 120<SUP>th</SUP> part of that Mile is 41⅔ feet, and so much is the space betweene the Knots upon the Log-line: So many Knots as the Ship runs in half a minute, so many Miles she sayleth in an hour; or so many Leagues, and so many Miles she runneth in a Watch or
<PB N="10" REF="40"/> four hours, called <HI>A Watch,</HI> because one half of the Ships Com∣pany watcheth by turns, and changes every four hours.</P>
<P><HI>Example</HI></P>
<P>Six Knots in half a minute is six Miles in an hour, or six Leagues six Miles in a Watch, which is eight Leagues or twenty four Miles in all.</P>
<P>Every Noon the Master and his Mates take the reckoning off the Log-board, and double the Knots run, and then divide the Pro∣duct, which is the number of Miles run by three, the quotient is the Leagues run since the former Noon, and according to custom the Log is thrown every two hours, and I never knew the course nea∣rer expressed on the Log-board, then to half a point of the Com∣pass.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in his excellent Book, called, <HI>The Sea-mans Practise,</HI> sheweth, That according to a late exact Experiment of his, which seemes to be very satisfactory, and confirmed by many other Experiments, that in ordinary Practise at Sea we cannot, if we will yield Truth the conquest, allow less then 360000 of our English feet to vary one degree of Latitude upon the earth, in sayling North or South under any Meridian, according to which account there will be in a degree of our Statute measure 68 2/1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Miles, each Mile containing 5280 feet, and of the common Sea-measure, allowing 5000 feet to a Mile, there will be 72 Miles, or 24 Leagues in a degree, which we shall take to be the truth.</P>
<P>A reckoning being kept in degrees, and Centesms or hundredth parts of a degree, is a ready way, and well approved by Mr. <HI>Nor∣wood</HI> in his said <HI>Sea-mans Practise;</HI> as also by Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> in his <HI>Geometrical Seaman,</HI> who wholly useth this measure, and yet the Mariner may very well refrain this measure, if he will keep his reckoning in Leagues and tenths, as I shall afterwards shew. Now to shew this measure, the Logline must have a knot placed at every 30 foot length, and as many of those as run out in half a Minute, so many Centesms or hundredth parts of a degree the ship sayleth in an hour, and for every three foot more you are to allow the tenth part of a Centesm, or the one thousandth part of a degree.</P>
<P>But if you would have it to shew the Miles of a true degree, allowing but 60 to a degree, the mile must be enlarged propor∣tionally, and the distance between every one of the Knots must
<PB N="11" REF="40"/> be 50 foot and as many of those as run out in half Minute, so many Miles or Minutes the ship saileth in an hour, and for every foot more you must allow the tenth part of a mile more and if Sea-men be desirous to retain their former custom of reckon∣ing the ships way in Leagues, then must either the said reckoning be reduced into degrees and Centesms of degrees by Arithmetick, because the degrees of Latitude on the Plain Chart, and of Longi∣tude and Latitude on <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> are divided, and that most conveniently into 10 parts, and each part supposed to be divided into 10 more, or else such a Scale of equal parts over and above must be added to each Chart, wherein a degree of Latitude in the Plain Chart, and of Longitude in <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> must be divided into 20 equal parts, and the labor of reducing by the Pen, will be saved; or the adding of any such Scale, may very well be spared and otherwise supplied, as I shall afterwards shew.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Reduction by the Pen.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Miles and their Decimals parts, are reduced into Leagues and tenths of Leagues, by dividing by three: Here note, that the tenth part of any measure is expressed either with a Comma or point before it, or else with a separating line thus, 3 or ⌊3 either way, the figure 3 signifies three parts of any thing divided into ten, and ⌊35 signifies thirty five parts of any thing divided into one hundred, and generally in this Decimal Arithmetick, the Denomi∣nator is understood to be an unit, with as many cyphers following it, as there are units in the Numerator; thus ⌊003 signifies three parts of one thousand.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI></P>
<P>375 ⌊6 Miles divided by 3, makes 125 ⌊2 Leagues, and on the contrary, 135 ⌊2 Leagues multiplyed by 3, makes 375 ⌊6 Miles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Leagues and their Decimals parts, are reduced into degrees and Centesmes, by separating one figure from the whole Leagues towards the left hand, and dividing the whole by 2.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>271 ⌊8 Leagues separated, will stand thus, 27 ⌊18 and then divi∣ded by two, the quotient is 13 ⌊59, that is 13 degrees and 59 Cen∣tesms, or hundredth parts of a degree more.</P>
<P>On the contrary degrees and centesms are deduced into Leagues,
<PB N="12" REF="41"/> and their Decimal parts, by placing the Comma after the first Decimal part, toward the right hand, and then multiplying the whole by two: thus the former number of degrees are to be expres∣sed 135, 9 which multiplyed by two, makes 271 ⌊8 leagues, as be∣fore.</P>
<P N="3">3. Minutes, whereof there are 60 in a degree, are reduced into Centesimals by annexing a Cipher thereto, and dividing by 6: thus 27 Minutes with a Cipher, make 270, which divided by 6, gives in the quotient 45 Centesms, here after 27 was divided by 6, the quotient was 4, and 3 remaining with the Cipher is 30, which divided by 6, the quotient is 5.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Centesmes of a degree are reduced into Minutes, by multiplying them by 6, and cutting off the last figure: thus, 75 Centesmes multiplyed by 6, make 450, which is 45 minutes.</P>
<P>This trouble, as I said before, is taken away by fitted Scales by the View onely, if they stand back to back, as in the Scales of equal parts on the Plain Scale, where 75 Centesmes in the lesser Scale of equal parts, stands against 45 parts or Minutes in the greater Scale of equal parts, and thus when the Latitudes of two places are given in degrees and minutes, the minutes are to be turned or reduced into Centesmes.</P>
<P>And so in the example of the former Chart, the line A B con∣taining 10 degrees, is divided into 20 parts, and one of those parts into 10 others, which I call, <HI>The Scale of Leagues of a true degree,</HI> then because the whole distance T N is too long to be measured at once, I first measure 10 degrees or 200 Leagues from T to C, and then C N measured on the Leagues, is 71 leagues and eight tenths more, and on the centesimal degrees, is 3 degrees 59 Centesmes.</P>
<P>So that the whole distance is 271 Leagues eight tenths, or 13 degrees 59 Centesmes, which is thus expressed 13<SUP>d</SUP>, 59: or thus, 13<SUP>d</SUP> ⌊59: or thus, 13<SUP>d</SUP> 59/100: and when we speak of minutes which are marked thus 1′, we alwayes presume there are but 60 of them in a degree.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Traverse-Quadrant.</HEAD>
<P>Before we come to work any Traverse, it will be very ready and convenient to prepare a Traverse-Quadrant, which as you see
<PB N="13" REF="41"/> by the Scheme of it is no other then a common Quadrant, having its Limbe divided into 16 equal parts, for the points and half points of the Compass, which may be easily done by the prickt rum∣bes on the Scale, each whole point being numbred from the Meri∣dian with Capital or letter figures.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In casting up a Traverse by this Quadrant, we shall imita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in his <HI>Sea-mans Practise,</HI> who after the same man∣ner plots the Surveigh of any Field, which he doth by help of Ta∣bles of <HI>Variation</HI> and <HI>Separation,</HI> but is here performed without them.</P>
<P>Then we will suppose that the Ship looseth from <HI>Tenariff,</HI> and sayleth 60 Leagues South South-West, afterwards she sayleth 80 Leagues West South-West, then meeting with a contrary winde she sayls 53 Leagues South and by East, half a point Eastwardly.</P>
<P>Suppose the Course and Distance from the Ship to <HI>St. Nicholas Island</HI> were now required; as also that it were demanded what Course the Ship should steer, and distance she should run to bring her self about 23 Leagues East from <HI>St. Nicholas Island,</HI> we shall plot the whole Traverse, and resolve the Questions demanded without drawing any Lines on the Plat.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="42"/>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="42"/>1. The first Course is 60 Leagues, South South West, which is the second point from the Meridian, take 60 out of the Scale of Leagues, and place it in the Traverse-quadrant from C the Center to <HI>a,</HI> the nearest distance from <HI>a</HI> to C W, place in the Chart, on the line T L from T to 1; also the nearest distance from <HI>a</HI> to C S in the Quadrant, place in the Court on the Line T D from T to 1.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Course was 80 Leagues, West Southwest, which is the sixth point from the Meridian, take 80 out of the Scale of Leagues, and place it in the Traverse-quadrant from C the Center to <HI>b,</HI> on the sixth Point, the nearest distance from <HI>b</HI> to C W place in the Chart on the line T L, from 1 to 2, and the nearest distance from <HI>b</HI> to C S in the Quadrant, place in the Chart on the line T D from 1 to 2, and thus the difference of Latitude or Variation, and the Departure from the Meridian or Separation, are added together, when they are of the same kind, that is, do still augment.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Course is South and by East, half a point East∣wardly 53 Leagues, which is a point and a half from the Meridian, which enter in the Traverse-quadrant on the said Course from C to <HI>c,</HI> the nearest distance from <HI>c</HI> to C W, because the difference of Latitude doth still increase; place in the Chart on the line T L from 2 to 3 towards L (otherwise if it had decreased, it must have been prickt backwards towards T) and the nearest distance from <HI>c</HI> to C S in the Quadrant, place in the Chart on the line D T from 2 to 3 towards T, because the Departure from the Me∣ridian decreaseth (otherwise if it had still increased, it should have been pricked from 2 towards D) having proceeded thus far, the point where the ship is in the Chart may be found to any one, or every one of the several Courses, without drawing any Lines in the Chart.</P>
<P N="1">1. Out of the West line T D take T 1, and with it upon the point 1 in the South line T L, describe a little Ark at <HI>a,</HI> also out of the South line take T 1, and with it on the West Line at 1 de∣scribe an Ark at <HI>a</HI> crossing the former, so the cross at the point <HI>a,</HI> shewes the place where the ship is at the first Course.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, take T 2 out of the West line, and setting one foot of the Compasses upon 2 in the South line, describe a small piece of an Ark near <HI>b;</HI> also take T 2 out of the South line, and set∣ting
<PB N="16" REF="43"/> one foot at 2 in the West line, describe an Ark crossing the former at <HI>b,</HI> which point is the place where the Ship was at the end of the second Course.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take T 3 out of the South Line, and setting one foot of the Compasses on 3, in the West Line describe a small Ark near <HI>c:</HI> Again, take T 3 out of the West Line, and upon 3 in the South Line, draw an Ark crossing the former at <HI>c,</HI> and <HI>c</HI> is the Point where the Ship is, according to this dead reckoning, and the for∣mer Point <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> need not have been found, for there is no question proposed concerning them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>To finde the Course and Distance from <HI>c</HI> to <HI>N.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. For the <HI>Distance,</HI> the extent <HI>c</HI> N measured on the Scale of Leagues, sheweth it to be 114 Leagues and a half.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the <HI>Course,</HI> to find it without drawing lines on the Chart, lay a ruler over N and <HI>c,</HI> which we must suppose to cross som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Meridian or parallel in the Chart, here it crosseth the South line at <HI>e,</HI> and the Scale of Leagues at <HI>f,</HI> then place the Radius or 90<SUP>d</SUP> of the line of greater Sines (which before was pricked from T to R) from <HI>e</HI> to <HI>g,</HI> and the nearest distance from <HI>g</HI> to the edge of the ruler measured on the Sines, sheweth the Course from the Ship to <HI>St. Nicholas Island,</HI> to lye 43<SUP>d</SUP> 17′ to the Westward of the South then if you look for 43<SUP>d</SUP> 17′ in the greater Chord, you shall finde in the Rumbes against it, that this Course is 3 points and above 3 quarters more to the Westward of the Meridian, that is, almost Southwest, and if <HI>e g</HI> had been placed from <HI>f</HI> toward A, the nearest distance to the edge of the ruler, would have shewed the complement of the Course required.</P>
<P N="3">3. To finde what Course the Ship must steer to bring her self about 23 Leagues or 22 Leagues 8 tenths East from <HI>St. Nicholas Island,</HI> draw a Line from N to L, and prick down 22 ⌊8 out of the Scale of Leagues from N to <HI>d,</HI> and this may be performed by the edge of a ruler without drawing any such Line, or otherwise it may be found by the intersection or crossing of two Arks, as the former Traverse Points were found. Now laying a ruler over <HI>d</HI> and <HI>c,</HI> it crosseth the South Line at <HI>h,</HI> then place T R from <HI>h</HI> to <HI>k,</HI> and the nearest distance from <HI>k</HI> to the edge of the ruler, measured on the greater Sines, sheweth the Course to be 33<SUP>d</SUP> 45′ to the Westward of the South, that is three points, to wit, South-west and by South.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="17" REF="43"/>4. The extent <HI>c d</HI> measured on the Scale of Leagues, sheweth the distance to be 100 Leagues.</P>
<P>Lastly, we suppose the Ship to sail this Course and distance till she come into the parrallel or Latitude of <HI>St. Nicholas Island</HI> at <HI>d,</HI> and then she sailes almost 23 Leagues West, and arrives at the Island, being her desired Port.</P>
<P>If it were required to finde the Ships Course and distance from the Point <HI>c</HI> to <HI>Tenariff.</HI></P>
<P>Lay a ruler over the Points T and <HI>c,</HI> the nearest distance from R to the edge of the ruler, measured on the greater line of Sines, sheweth that the Course from <HI>Tenariff</HI> to the Ship is 30<SUP>d</SUP> 47′ to the Westward of the South, which is almost two points three quar∣ters; and contrarily <HI>Tenariff</HI> bears from the Ship as much to the Eastward of the North, and the extent <HI>c</HI> T measured on the Leagues, sheweth the distance of <HI>Tenariff</HI> from the Ship to be 158 Leagues.</P>
<P>This I think sufficient to explain the use of the <HI>Plain Chart,</HI> upon which in the laying down of any two places in their Rumbe and distance, there is framed a right angled Plain Triangle, one side whereof T L is the difference of Latitude, the other side L N the difference of Longitude, and the third side N T the distance, And after the same manner a Traverse is to be platted, when the Chart is made true as to the Latitudes of places, and as neare the truth as to the Rumbe and distance as it can, waving the longitude; and as the whole Navigation of a Voyage is performed on this Chart without drawing any lines thereon to deface it, so after the same manner, and well nigh with as much ease, may it be perform∣ed on the true Sea Chart, commonly called <HI>Mercators,</HI> as shall afterwards be shewed.</P>
<P>But before I part from this Discourse, I think it necessary to shew how the former Scale of Leagues may very well be spared, and still account the distance run in Leagues and tenths, provided the degrees of Latitude on the Sides of the Chart be divided each of them into 10 equal parts, accounting each degree for 10 Leagues. Take 40 Leagues, and setting one foot in 80 leagues, draw the Ark G, which may be done by any other numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the same Proportion, and draw a line from H <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust touching the said Ark, and the Scale of leagues A B may be spared.</P>

<P>But supposing the distance T <HI>a</HI> in the Chart were unknown, and I would measure it, take the said extent, and prick it twice in the side of the Chart from H, and it will reach to 60, and so many leagues is the distance required; and so any other extent turned twice over, shewes the distance in leagues, accounting every de∣grees 10 leagues, and being turned but once over, shewes the distance in degrees and Decimal parts.</P>

<HEAD>How in estimating the Ships Course and Distance, to allow for known Currents.</HEAD>
<P>This subject is handled by Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in his <HI>Sea-mans Pra∣ctice,</HI> at the end, and by Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> in his <HI>Advancement of Navi∣gation,</HI> page 54 to 64. As also how to how find them out by com∣paring the reckoning outwards between two places, with that homewards, wherefore I shall be very brief about it, and perform that with Scale and Compasses, which is by them done with Tables.</P>
<P N="1">1. If you stem a Current, if it be swifter then the Ships way, you fall a stern; but if it be slower, you get on head so much as is the difference between the way of the Ship, and the race of the Current.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI> If a Ship sail 7 Miles North in an hour, by estimation against a Current that sets South 4 Miles in an hour, then the ship makes way three Miles or a League in an hour on head, but if the Ships way were 4 Miles in an hour by estimation North against a Current that sets 7 Miles in an hour South, the Ship would fall 3 Miles or a league a stern in an hour.</P>
<P>But suppose a Ship to cross a Current that sets S S E about 3 miles an hour, and first the Ship in 4 hours sayls 8 leagues East and by South by the Compass, then in 8 hours more she sayls 12 leagues East South-east, by the Compass: Now it is demanded what Course and Distance the Ship hath made good from the first place where this recknoning began: In resolving this we shall ac∣count every ten leagues of the former Scale of leagues in the Plat to be but one.</P>

<P>Draw two lines at right Angles at the Center A, thus: First draw the line A F, then with 60 degrees of the Chords describe the prickt quadrant F I L, and therein set off one point from the East to I, and draw a line to A, this is the line of the Ships first Course, wherein prick off 8 leagues from A to B. Prick off the course of the Current, being 6 points to the Southwards of the East, from F to E, and draw the line L A, then because the Cur∣rent in 4 hours sets 4 leagues forward in its own race, draw the line B C parallel to A L, by the former directions, and prick down 4 four leagues from B to C, and the line A C shews what course and distance the Ship hath made good the first Watch, or four hours.</P>
<P>Then for the second Course, draw C H parallel to the line A F, and with the Radius upon C as a Center, draw the Arch H D, wherein prick two points for the Ships second Course from the East from H to D, and draw D C, wherein prick down C D the Ships distance run in that Course, and draw D G parallel to A L, as you did B C; then because the Current sets 8 leagues in 8 hours, prick down 8 leagues from D to G, and joyn A G, so the extent A G being measured on the Scale of leagues, sheweth that the Ships direct distance from the first place, is about twenty eight leagues and a half; then measure the Arch F M on the Rumbes, and you will finde it to be a little above 3¼ points from the East, so that the Ship hath made her way good South-east and by East, and above a quarter of a point more Southwardly, and is now at the point G, whereas if there had been no Current, she had been but at N in the same line with D G, and distant from it equal to B C.</P>
<P>And what we have done here with drawing many Lines, after the old fashion of keeping a reckoning on the Plain Chart, may be done by help of the Traverse-quadrant by Intersection and points onely, without drawing any other Lines at all, but the two Lines making right angles at A, in which are plotted the Ships two Courses and distances; as also the Currents, Course, and distances proper to each of the Ships Courses, and the Variation and Se∣paration proper to each Course, hath the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, on the South and East-line truly set down, whereby may be found the 4 points B, C, D, G, after the same manner, as the reckoning was
<PB N="21" REF="45"/> platted between <HI>Tenariff</HI> and <HI>St. Nicholas Island</HI> before, and in stead of laying down the Current at the end of each Course and distance, it may be done at once for many courses and distances, if you bring them first into one right line from the first place, and cast up into one Sum how much ought to be allowed to each Course and distance during the time of its continuance, and from the Traverse Point of the Ships place so found, set off the allow∣ance for the Current in a Rumbe line that runs the same way with the Current.</P>

<HEAD>How to Rectifie the Account when the dead Latitude differs from the Observed Latitude.</HEAD>
<P>By the <HI>Dead Latitude,</HI> is meant the Latitude in which the Ship is by the <HI>Dead Reckoning</HI> or <HI>Estimation,</HI> and this is always given, as in the former Chart between <HI>Tenariff</HI> and <HI>St. Nicholas Island,</HI> by the points 1, 2, 3, in the South-line, if they be measured in the other side of the Chart amongst the degrees of Latitude.</P>
<P>The whole Practise of the art of Navigation in keeping a due reckoning, consists chiefly of three Members or Branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. An experienced judgement in estimating the Ships way in her Course upon every shift of Wind, allowing for Leeward-way and Currents.</P>
<P N="2">2. In duly estimating the Course or Point of the Compass on which the Ship hath made her way good, allowing for Currents and the Variation of the Compass.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the frequent and due Observing the Latitude.</P>
<P>The reckoning arising out of the two former Branches, is called the <HI>Dead Reckoning,</HI> and of these three Branches there ought to be such an harmony and consent, that any two being given, a third Conclusion may be thence raised with truth.</P>
<P>As namely, from the Course and distance, to find the Latitude of the Ships place.</P>
<P>Or by the Course and difference of Latitude, to finde the di∣stance; or by the difference of Latitude and distance, to finde the Course: But in the midst of so many uncertainties that daily occur in the practise of Navigation, a joynt Consent in these three par∣ticulars is hardly to be expected, and when an error ariseth, the sole remedy to be trusted to, is the observation of the Latitude, or
<PB N="22" REF="46"/> the known Soundings when a Ship is near land, and how to rectifie the Reckoning by the observed latitude, we shall now shew.</P>
<P>Those that will not yeild unto truth in this particular, that a bout 24 of our common English Sea leagues are to be allowed to vary a degree of latitude under the Meridian, do put themselves into a double incapacity.</P>
<P>First, in sailing directly North or South under the Meridian where there is no Current, finding their Reckoning to fall short of the observed latitude, they take it to be an error in their judge∣ment in concluding the Ships way by Estimation or guess to be too little.</P>
<P>And secondly, if there be a Current that helps set them forward, that there is a near agreement between the observed and the dead latitude, they conclude there is no such Current.</P>
<P>Or lastly, if they stem the Current, they conclude it to be much swifter then in truth it is, and thus one error commonly begets another, but supposing a conformity to the truth, we shall prescribe four Precepts for correcting a simple or single Course.</P>
<P><HI>Prec.</HI> I. First therfore, if a ship sail under the Meridian, if the dif∣ference of latitude be less by estimation then it is by observation, the Ships place or Variation onely is to be corrected and enlarged under the Meridian, and the error i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be imputed either to the judgement in guessing at the distance run, in making it too little, or if the said distance be guessed at by a sound and experienced judgement, you may suppose you stem some Current.</P>
<P>So if a Ship saile from A in the latitude of 28<SUP>d</SUP> directly South 48, such leagues whereof 20 are a degree, the difference of lati∣tude is 2 degrees 24 minutes, each league being 3 minutes, by this estimate the Ship should be at B, but if the observed latitude be but 25 degrees, the reckoning being amended, the Ships place is at the point D, and in this Scheme we have made every degree of latitude to be twice as large as it was in the former Chart, and so the degrees of latitude in that Chart will become a Scale of leagues to this.</P>
<P>But if the difference of latitude be more by Estimation, then it is by observation, either the judgement erres in supposing the distance run to be too much: in this case the distance is to be shortned, and the Ships place corrected, according to the observed
<PB N="23" REF="46"/> latitude under the Meridian; so if a ship sayle South from A in the Latitude of 28<SUP>d</SUP>, till she hath varied her latitude 2<SUP>d</SUP> 24′ by Estimation, being at the Point B in the latitude of 25<SUP>d</SUP> 36′, if the observed latitude be 26<SUP>d</SUP>, the Ships place being corrected by this Observation, will be in the Point E, and not at B.</P>
<P>Or if you can presume upon the truth of your judgement, and finde it so to happen, commonly that the distance run is more then you can make it by observation, you may well suppose you cross some Current which sets either Eastward or Westward, but can∣not tell which until you come near some Land, to see which way the ripples of Water set, or are informed by the experience of others.</P>
<P>In this Case, supposing the distance and difference of Latitude to be true, you are to conclude the Ship hath made her way good not North or South under the Meridian, but upon some other point of the Compass, either Eastward or Westward: let us sup∣pose Westward, the Rumbe it self need not be drawn in the Chart, wherefore in the Chart or Traverse-quadrant, having
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="24" REF="47"/> made A E equal to the observed difference of latitude, with the distance equal to A B, set one foot of the Compasses in E, and with the other cross A W at S, so is A S the Depa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture from the Meridian or Separation required, whereby you may draw the Rumbe line required A C, by finding the Intersections at C; or upon B, with the extent A S, describe an Ark, and draw the line A C <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust touching the outward edge therreof, and it shall be the Rumbe required; which being measured by former directions, will be found to be the third point from the Meridian, so that the ships course was South-west and by South, and not South as it seemed to the appearance: In altering the Rumbe, in this case be cau∣tious, for a small mistake in the estimating of the distance, will cause a considerable alteration in the Rumbe.</P>
<P><HI>Precept</HI> II. But supposing no Current, if the ship sayl upon one of the five Rumbes next the Meridian, if the <HI>Dead Latitude</HI> dif∣fer from the <HI>Observed Latitude,</HI> the error is in mis-judging the di∣stance run, which is either to be enlarged or shortned, as the case requires.</P>
<P>In the former Scheme, suppose a ship sayl from A South-west and by South 48 leagues, being by estimation at C in the latitude of 26<SUP>d</SUP>, but if the latitude by observation be but 25<SUP>d</SUP> 36′, suppose at B, then a line drawn through B, parallel to A W, crosseth the line of the ships course at M, which is the corrected Point where the ship is, and hereby the Distance is enlarged, the extent A M being 57, 7 leagues, that is 57 leagues, and a little above two mile more.</P>
<P>In like manner if the Ship had sayled about 72 leagues on that course, and were by estimation at the Point G in the latitude of 25<SUP>d</SUP>, and by the observation the latitude were found to be 25<SUP>d</SUP> 36′, in this case the ships distance is to be shortned, by drawing the aforesaid line B M parallel to A W, which crosseth the line of the ships course at M, which is now the corrected Point of the ships place.</P>
<P>Either of these Instances may be performed on the Chart, by finding out the separation or westwardly distance proper to the corrected latitude without drawing any lines, and that by help of the Traverse-Quadrant, <HI>page</HI> 13. in which C B there, is made equal to A B the difference of latitude here, then in the said
<PB N="25" REF="47"/> Quadrant either raise a Perpendicular from that point, cutting the third Rumbe, or enter the said extent on the third Rumbe, so that one foot resting therein, as at D, the other turned about will but just touch C W, then the nearest distance from D to C S, is the separation required, which in this Chart is to be placed from A to L, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he separation corrected, whereas the dead separa∣tion need not be known or found at all.</P>
<P>But in these cases, if the judgement suppose there is some Cur∣rent, and can depend upon the observed difference of Latitude and dead Distance, as both true, then the Departure from the Meridian may be found, as in the last caution of the former Pre∣cept, whereby the error will be imputed to the Rumbe, which al∣ters by reason of the supposed Current.</P>
<P><HI>Precept</HI> III. But in Rumbes near the East or West, if the dead latitude differ from the observed latitude, the error is to be im∣puted either wholly to the Rumbe, or partly to the Rumbe, partly to the Distance.</P>
<P>If wholly to the Rumbe, then retain the observed difference of latitude, and the estimated distance, and finde the Separation or Departure from the Meridian, as was done in the last Caution of the first Case or Precept.</P>
<P>But if the judgement would allot the error partly to the Rum∣be, partly to the Distance, retain the observed difference of lati∣tude; and for the Departure from the Meridian, let it be the same as it was made by the Dead Reckoning.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI></P>
<P>So if a ship sayl West and by South half a point Southerly 68, 9 leagues, that is 68 leagues and nine tenths, from the latitude of 28<SUP>d</SUP> from A to H, and by the Dead Reckoning should be in the latitude of 27<SUP>d</SUP>; if the latitude by observation be 27<SUP>d</SUP> 20′, which will happen at the point I: In this case, if the error were wholly imputed to the distance, the line I K being drawn parallel to A W, would cut off and shorten the distance as much as the mea∣sure of K H, which is 23 leagues, which because it seems absurd and improbable, is not to be admitted of; wherefore imputing the error to the Rumbe onely, place one foot of the extent A H in I, and with the other cross the line A W at T, and so is A T
<PB N="26" REF="48"/> the Departure from the Meridian required, whereby the Rumbe line, if it were drawn, would be altered to pass through the cross at <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>But according to the last Caution of this Precept, if you judge the error to be partly in the Rumbe, and partly in the Distance, prick the Departure by the Dead Reckoning F H, from A to V, and so by help of the points of Variation I, and Separation V, you may draw a new Rumbe line, and finde the quantity thereof; as also of the shortned distance by the direction for platting a Traverse.</P>
<P><HI>Precept</HI> IV. If a Ship sayl directly East or West, and the dead and observed Latitude do both agree, the Reckoning cannot be corrected.</P>
<P>But if they differ, the error is either partly in the Rumbe, and partly in the Distance, in which case retaining the Separation or Westwardly Distance the same, the difference of Latitude is the Variation required, whereby a new Rumbe-line might be drawn if it were needful.</P>
<P>But if by frequent observation you finde the Ship is still carried from the East or West, either Northwards or Southwards, you may conclude some Current to be the cause thereof, in which case re∣taining the distance to be the same it was by the Dead Reckoning, and the difference of Latitude to be the same you found it by ob∣servation, finde the Departure from the Meridian by former di∣rections, whereby the Ships Rumbe or Course might be drawn if it were needful: It is not necessary to press Examples, if what before is written be well understood, especially in this case where all directions are slippery.</P>
<P>Thus in imitation of <HI>Maetius</HI> a Hollander, though a Latine Au∣thor, we have prescribed several rules for the correction of a single Course, which Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> in his <HI>Geometrical Sea-man</HI> makes but one rule, retaining always the same Course, and correcting the di∣stance run therein, by drawing a parallel through the observed La∣titude, and so for many Courses they are first brought all into one line, and the distance corrected by the same rule.</P>
<P>But concerning it, we must give a double Caution: First, that no three places can be laid down true in their Courses and Di∣stances from each other on the Plain Chart, as shall afterwards be
<PB N="27" REF="48"/> handled, however the error in small distances will be incon∣siderable.</P>
<P>And secondly admitting they could, the said general Direction is unsound, but the nearer the truth the nearer the Courses are to the Meridian, and when all the Courses do either increase or diminish the Latitude, but very erronious when some Courses in∣crease and others lessen the Latitude; in all which Cases it is most safe to allot to the Variation or dead Difference of Latitude, of every Course its proportional share of the whole error between the Dead and Observed Latitude, and then to correct each course by the former directions.</P>
<P>First therefore in the following Chart, let us suppose a Ship to sayl from A in the Latitude of 28<SUP>d</SUP> South South-west, almost 65 leagues to B, this Course is set off in the Arch E F, and by the Dead Reckoning she should now be in the Latitude of 25<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<P>Again, from B she sayls South-west and by West 72 leagues to C, which Course being three points from the West, is set off in the Arch G H, and now by the dead Reckoning she should be in the Latitude of 23 degrees, whereas by a good observation she is found to be in the Latitude of 23<SUP>d</SUP> 30′; wherefore to correct this Reckoning draw the line C A, which is the compound Course arising from the two former Courses, and through the parallel of observed Latitude, draw L K parallel to A W, so is the point K the corrected point of the Ships place, according to Mr. <HI>Phil∣lips,</HI> and agreeing with the truth, as we have fitted the Ex∣ample.</P>
<P>But now as to the other way of correcting a compound Course, it is to be done by this Proportion.</P>
<P>First finde the Variation or Difference of Latitude proper to each Course, then it holds:</P>
<P><HI>As the sum of all the Variations or Differences of Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the whole error between the Dead and Observed Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is each particular Difference of Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To its proportional share of the whole error</HI> ∷</P>
<P>In this case A S is the sum of all the Differences of Latitude, and S L is the whole error between the dead and observed Lati∣tude, therewith upon S as a Center, describe an Ark at M, and draw the line A M just touching the outward edge of the said
<FIGURE>
<PB N="28" REF="49"/>
</FIGURE> Ark, then the nearest distance between E and the said line, is the error in the dead latitude at the first Course.</P>
<P>Then if the differences of Latitude fall all the same way, if the the estimated difference of Latitude be too much, you must abate out of each dead Latitude its proportional error, so in this case the said error is prickt from E to N.</P>
<P>But when the estimated difference of Latitude is too little, the proportional error must be added to each difference of Latitude, then prick the second dead difference of Latitude being equal to E S, from N to O, and place the said extent from A the Center,
<PB N="29" REF="49"/> to Y, and take the nearest distance to M A as before, and prick it from O to L, being the second error: this is needful when there are more Courses then two, but for the last Course not at all necessary, neither is it for this; then through the point N draw the line N F parallel to A W, so is F the corrected Point of the Ships place at the first Course, then draw F K parallel to B C, and where the parallel of Latitude cuts it as at K, is the corrected Point of the Ships place at the second Course, being the same we found it before the other way.</P>
<P>But in stead of the second Course and distance, which was 72 Leagues South-west and by west, let us now suppose the Ship sayls the same distance from the point B North-west and by west, which Course being as much on the other side the west, make G I equal to G H, and draw the Course B I, therein pricking off the for∣mer distance to D, so is D the point of the Ships dead reckoning in the Latitude of 27<SUP>d</SUP>; and now supposing the observed Latitude to be 27<SUP>d</SUP> 30′, the error and difference of Latitude are as much now as they were before; wherefore draw D A the compound rumbe: draw Q T parallel to A W, &amp; where it cuts the compound rumbe as at P, by M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Phillips</HI> his reckoning, is the corrected point of the Ships place at the end of the second Course, whereas in truth it should happen at T, and so P bears from A, in this exam∣ple 76<SUP>d</SUP> 43′ from the Meridian, and is distant from it 43 Leagues and a half, whereas the Ships true Course from A to T, is 83<SUP>d</SUP> 32′ from the Meridian, and the distance almost 89 leagues, which is very considerable.</P>
<P>Now for as much as the Sum of the differences of Latitude A E and E <HI>f,</HI> in this latter example, is equal to A S in the former ex∣ample, also the error <HI>f</HI> Q here, is equal to S L there, therefore the proportional part of each error will be the same as before.</P>
<P>Then if some Courses decrease the Latitude Southwardly, and others increase it North-wardly, if the dead Latitude be too little, as in this example, consider that to place the Ship more North-wardly, so as to allot to each difference of Latitude its proper error, that the South-wardly differences of Latitude must be de∣creased or lessened, and the North-wardly increased; wherefore the proportion of the error is placed from E to N, and the Point F found as before.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="50"/>
<P>In like manner, if the dead Latitude were too much to bring the Ship more South-wardly, the Southern differences of Latitude must be increased, and the Northern decreased, now the point T is found by drawing a line from F the corrected point of the first Course, parallel to B D, and so the line F V being equal to B D, is the Ships second Course and distance from the corrected point F, then in regard part of the error in the Latitude is supposed to be committed, as well in the latter as in the former Course, which error being too little, the distance F V is to be enlarged, and where the parallel of observed Latitude cuts it, as at T, is the cor∣rected point of the Ships place at the end of the second Course.</P>
<P>And though what we have here performed be done by the draw∣ing of many Lines, yet by help of the Traverse-quadrant it may may be inserted into the Chart, without drawing any Lines therein at all, for in each the Course and corrected Difference of Lati∣tude is given; and that two things are sufficient to dispatch the work, we have shewed before.</P>
<P>Those that are prompt in Plain Triangles, may exercise their knowledge in calculating the things here required</P>

<P><HI>Horn Sound</HI> and <HI>Fogg bay</HI> being laid down true as to the dif∣ference of Latitude and Longitude, the Course between them by the Plain Chart is 68<SUP>d</SUP> 11′ from the Meridian, and the distance 1424 Leagues.</P>
<P N="2">2. If they be laid down true (as they may be) in their Course, distance, and difference of Latitude, then the difference of Longitude will be false, consequently the difference of Longitude between those two places thus laid down, should be but 27<SUP>d</SUP> 17′, whereas in truth it should be much more, to wit, 66<SUP>d</SUP> 30′.</P>
<P N="3">3. No two places can be laid down true in these three respects, as to their Course, Distance, and Difference of Longitude, but if you would lay them down true in two of these respects, whereof there are three Cases: First, in their Course and Distance, then the Difference of Latitude will be true, and the Difference of Longi∣tude false, as in the second Case. Secondly, in their Course and Difference of Longitude, then will the Distance and Difference of Latitude be much more then it should; the Distance thus found will be 1860 leagues, and the difference of Latitude 65<SUP>d</SUP> 3′, and should be but 26<SUP>d</SUP> 40′. Thirdly, to lay them down true in their Distance and Difference of Longitude, in many Cases is im∣possible, and in this Example; but yet where the Difference of Latitude is more then the Difference of Longitude, this may be
<PB N="34" REF="52"/> done, but then the Difference of Latitude will always be too lit∣tle, and the Rumbe too wide from the Meridian.</P>
<P N="4">4. Three places cannot be laid down true, as to their Latitudes, Courses and Distances from each other, though we wave the Lon∣gitude, as shall afterwards be shewed; from which premises we may raise these consequences.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in regard three places cannot be laid down true in their Courses, Distances and Latitudes, although we wave and ad∣mit the Difference of Longitude to be false, that it is no safe way to make Charts, as generally they are, to be true as to the Lati∣tudes of places, and as near the truth as they can as to the Cour∣ses and Distances, for out of such a false Chart a true one cannot be made, nor the true rumbe and distance between most places found.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it were best to make these Charts true, as to the Lon∣gitudes and Latitudes of all places, in regard the true rumbe and distance may be thence easily found, as we shall shew; and an∣other true Chart or Globe graduated from them, and that in stead of putting in such abundance of Compasses and Rumbe-lines, both in the <HI>Plain</HI> and <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> it were better to leave them out, and to put into some spare place the Traverse-quadrant with points and half points, and a Limbe divided into degrees, with a Line of Sines, or else the Sines of the points, halfs, and quarters onely.</P>
<P N="3">3. That being so made near the Equinoctial, they are very near the truth, and may there very well serve, as also under the Meridian, and for short Distances or Voyages: and how to take away the Error of the Chart, and make them serve for long and remote Voyages shall be handled; in order whereto the first Pro∣position in the use of the <HI>Plain Chart</HI> must be repeated.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Propos. I.</HI> The Longitudes and Latitudes of any two places being given, to finde the true Course or Rumbe between those places, and the Distance in the Rumbe.</HEAD>
<P>This, of all other Propositions in Navigation, is the most use∣ful, and withal the most difficult, and hath, as learned <HI>Snellius</HI> well observes, been often attempted by the Learned, but in vain; and to give our own Nation its due repute, was never generally
<PB N="35" REF="52"/> and satisfactorily performed by any man, till our late famous Countrey-man Mr. <HI>Edward Wright</HI> invented that excellent Chart, called <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> but ought more properly to be called <HI>Wrights Chart,</HI> the Meridian-line whereof requires a Table to be made by the perpetual Addition of Secants, without which Table as yet there are no Proportions known that will serve to calculate the Rumbe generally between any two places, by help of the Na∣tural Tables of Sines, Tangents, and Secants onely, and what∣soever may be done by those Tables, may be also done geometri∣cally by Schemes: True it is, this Proposition may be performed by the differences of the Logarithmical Tangents, having a Table of them, as in Mr. <HI>Norwoods Epitome,</HI> without the help of a Ta∣ble of the Meridian-line, but as yet we have no geometrical way known for making the Logarithmical-lines of Tangents, nor Sines and numbers.</P>
<P>Before I proceed any further, it may be objected, That we have Proportions in our English Books, delivered for calculating the Rumbe between two places, which Proportions may be perform∣ed by the Natural Tables of Sines and Tangents onely; as name∣ly, in Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> Works, both in the former and latter Editions: in the third Edition in page 90.</P>

<P>The Meridional parts are to be taken out of a Table of the Meridian-line, by substracting the Meridional parts of the lesser Latitude, from the Meridional parts of the greater Latitude; by comparing these two Proportions together, because the third and fourth tearm are alike in each; it would follow that we might cal∣culate the Meridional parts required, without the perpetual ad∣dition of Secants by this Proportion, raised out of the two former tearms of each Proportion:</P>

</TABLE> which sufficiently refutes the truth of Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> Proportion, in calculating a Rumbe from the Equinoctial.</P>
<P>But now, as for finding the Meridional parts between the two former Latitudes, in one or both Hemispheres, the middle Lati∣tude in one Hemisphere will be 60<SUP>d</SUP>, and the Meridional parts 40<SUP>d</SUP>, 00, and in both Hemispheres if found at once by the middle Latitude, which is 10<SUP>d</SUP>, is 121<SUP>d</SUP>, 85; or if found severally at twice, 140<SUP>d</SUP>, 616, which varying from the truth, as above ex∣pressed in the Sum and Difference, we may conclude, that the Proportion is very unsound and intolerable for any great differ∣ence of Latitude, but Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> Works deliver no Caution a∣bout it: Before we can finde the distance, the Rumbe must be calculated, and if that be false, a small error therein may cause a considerable error in the distance.</P>
<P>Where the difference of Latitude is not above five degrees, it may serve very well near the truth from the Equinoctial to 60<SUP>d</SUP> of Latitude, and afterwards to 80<SUP>d</SUP>; it will not serve for three de∣grees difference of Latitude, and in all Cases the Cosine of the middle Latitude is a tearm too great, the middle Latitude being too small, and I think no certain Rule can be given to correct it.</P>
<P>From what hath been said, the Reader may take due Caution how far to depend upon such Proportions, whereof one tearm is the middle Latitude: such are,</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of the middle Latitude: To the Radius</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Or, <HI>As the Radius: Is to the Secant of the middle Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Departure from the Meridian:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Difference of Longitude:</HI></P>
<P>And to this Proportion Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> his late Table of Secants
<PB N="37" REF="53"/> are fitted, in the use whereof the middle Latitude must always be taken to be a whole degree, unless you will by proportion finde the difference required.</P>
<P>And I taking it to be what it truly happened, did cast up the Courses and Distances Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> expresses in his <HI>Trigonometry,</HI> home from the <HI>Bermudas</HI> to the <HI>Lizard,</HI> by his Tables in the said Book, and found I had gotten almost half a degree of Longitude in the whole too much, by reason the Proportion is not sound, of which Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> makes no use: those Courses and Distances are truly expressed in Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> his <HI>Geometrical Sea-man,</HI> pag. 31. whereas in the last Impression of Mr. <HI>Norwoods</HI> Book they are mis-printed.</P>
<P>Another Proportion of this kinde, is:</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of the middle Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Sine of the Rumbe from the Meridian</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Distance sayled:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Difference of Longitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P>So also there may be two Proportions for finding the enlarged Distance:</P>
<P><HI>As to the Radius:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Secant of the middle Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the distance run:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the enlarged distance on</HI> Mercators Chart ∷</P>
<P>Otherwise,</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of the Rumbe from the Meridian:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Secant of the middle Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Departure from the Meridian:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the enlarged Distance</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Note when these Proportions are used, the measure of the en∣larged distance must be taken from the degrees of Longitude in <HI>Mercators Chart.</HI></P>
<P>Another Proportion for finding the Rumbe, may be gathered from Mr. <HI>Hansons</HI> Additions to <HI>Pitiscus his Trigonometry,</HI> and is:</P>
<P><HI>As the difference of Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the half Sum of the Cosines of both Latitudes</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Longitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of the Rumbe</HI> ∷</P>
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
<P>This he doth not insist upon as absolutely true, but yet leaves it uncertain when to use it, and when not, the half Sum of the Cosines is a tearm somewhat near in many Cases to the Cosine of the middle Latitude, and by the like reason this Proportion may be refuted, as that was; the half sum of the Cosines is a tearm that may very well serve near the truth for 10 degrees difference of Latitude, or more between the Latitudes of 20<SUP>d</SUP> and 60<SUP>d</SUP>, near the Poles it is too great, in which case the geometrical mean is truer, near the Equinoctial, and generally in both Hemi∣spheres it is too small; and this I thought fit to adde, that those that use geometrical Schemes derived from these Proportions, may not be mis-led, and after a troublesome manner the Course and distance in the <HI>Seamans Calendar</HI> is laid down between two places, in effect from this latter Propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion: and for the performance of what is there done, the Scale of Longitudes was formerly added to the Plain Scale, that thereby we might finde how many miles in every Latitude would answer to one degree of Longitude, and thence by Proportion obtain the distance between two places that differ onely in Longitude, which way is tedious. And for finding how many miles in any Latitude vary one degree of Longitude (if it were needful) is easily performed by the Plain Scale, as I have now contrived it; take the Complement of the Latitude from the greater Scale of Sines, and measure it in the greater Scale of leagues or equal parts.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>So if the Latitude were 52<SUP>d</SUP>, the Complement thereof is 38<SUP>d</SUP>, and the Sine thereof measured in the greater Scale makes 37, and so many miles or minutes in that Latitude alter one degree of Longitude, which on the other Scale of equal parts, shewes 61 Centesmes of a degree.</P>
<P>And before I apply my self to small Distances, I think it not amiss to express how these Proportions finde the Rumbe between <HI>Horn Sound</HI> and <HI>Fog Bay.</HI></P>
<P>By the Cosine of the middle Latitude, the Rumbe is 48<SUP>d</SUP> 14′ from the Meridian, and the Distance 800 leagues. In one Hemis∣phere the middle Latitude is the half sum of both Latitudes.</P>
<P>By the half sum of the Cosines of both Latitudes, the Rumbe is 47<SUP>d</SUP> 28′ from the Meridian, and the Distance about 789 leagues.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>
<P>But supposing these places to be in different Hemispheres, the middle Latitude will be the half difference of both Latitudes: And by the Cosine of the middle Latitude, the Rumbe is 27 de∣grees 2 minutes. and the Distance is 2842 leagues.</P>
<P>By the half sum of the Cosines of both Latitudes, the Rumbe is 12 degrees 54 minutes, and the Distance 2598 leagues, whereas in this latter Case the truth by <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> is 20 degrees 11 minutes from the Meridian for the Rumbe, and 2699 leagues for the Distance.</P>
<P>And the Distance between those places in the Arch of a great Circle, is near 729 leagues, and supposing them in different He∣mispheres, it is 2667 leagues.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Now to the Proposition for finding the Rumbe geometrically, as far as the former Proportions hold true.</HEAD>
<P>Each of the former Proportions may be made two, as in the first Part, by bringing in the Radius, whereof we need onely work one, and that will be in the first Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Cosine of the middle Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Longitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the whole Departure from the Meridian, in the Course between the two places proposed</HI> ∷</P>
<P>And in the second Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the half sum of the Cosines of both Latitudes</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Or rather for Geometrical Schemes.</P>
<P><HI>As the Diameter: Is to the sum of the Cosines of both Latitudes</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Longitude: To the Departure from the Me∣ridian, in the Course between the two places</HI> ∷</P>
<P>The latter Proportion of this Division, of which we make no use, is:</P>
<P><HI>As the difference of Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the aforesaid Departure from the Meridian</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius: To the Tangent of the Rumbe</HI> ∷</P>

<P>Out of the lesser equal parts, prick down 15<SUP>d</SUP>, 33 Centesmes from C to L, and describe the Arch B D with 60<SUP>d</SUP> of the Chords, and make it equal to 49<SUP>d</SUP> 30′, and draw C D continued further to A, from L take the nearest distance to A C, which is equal to L M, and make it one Leg of a right angled Triangle: Make the other Leg the difference of Latitude 5<SUP>d</SUP>, which prick from the equal parts from L to F, then the extent M F measured on the said parts, sheweth the distance to be 13<SUP>d</SUP> 39 Centesmes, which allowing 20 Leagues to a degree, is almost 268 Leagues: with the Radius C B setting one foot at M, cross the Rumbe Triangle at G and H, which extent measured on the greater Chord is almost 22<SUP>d</SUP>, the Complement whereof is 68<SUP>d</SUP>, and so much is the Rumbe from the Meridian between these two places, which is 6 points and about 30 minutes more, wherefore <HI>St. Michaels Isle</HI> bears from <HI>Cape Finister</HI> west south west, half a degree more westwardly.</P>
<P>If two places had been both in the Latitude of 40<SUP>d</SUP> 30′, having the same difference of Longitude, to wit, 15<SUP>d</SUP> 20′, then had the

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How Geometrically to supply the Meridian-line of <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> generally.</HEAD>
<P>That the finding of the true Rumbe between two places, might not be a Proposition out of the reach of Geometry, or not to be per∣formed by Scale and Compasses, the supply thereof became the Contemplation of the late learned Mr. <HI>Samuel Forster</HI> Professor of Astronomie in <HI>Gresham Colledge,</HI> who in his Treatise of a ruler, Entituled, <HI>Posthuma Fosteri,</HI> makes a Meridian-line out of a Scale of Secants: this we shall be brief in, and shew how near it comes to the truth. Let it be required to make a Meridian-line of such a scantling, that one degree of Longitude may be half an inch, which is of the same size with the Print thereof at the end of the Book.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="56"/>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Make a quadrant as A C B, wherein prick down half an inch from C to D, and raise the Perpendicular D E: Sup∣pose I would take out the Se∣cant of 43<SUP>d</SUP> 30′ to that Ra∣dius, prick this arch down from B in the Limbe towards E, and lay a ruler over it, and it will cut the Line D E at F, then is D F the Tangent of that Arch to half an inch Ra∣dius, and C F the Secant thereof. After this manner the Secant of any Arch is to be taken out, I say then that the Secant of 30′ thus taken out, shall be the length of the first degree of the Meridian-line, and the Secant of 1<SUP>d</SUP> 30′ so taken out, shall reach from the first to the second degree of the Meridian-line, and the Secant of 2<SUP>d</SUP> 30′ shall be the distance between the second and third degree of the Meri∣dian-line, and so on successively through every degree to 80<SUP>d</SUP> or 85<SUP>d</SUP>, and further we do not need it.</P>
<P>And so if it were required to make the Meridian-line from 43<SUP>d</SUP> to 50<SUP>d</SUP> of Latitude, the former extent C F out of the quadrant shall reach in this line F L from 43<SUP>d</SUP> to 44, in like manner the Secant of 44<SUP>d</SUP> 30′ so taken out, shall reach from 44<SUP>d</SUP> to 45.</P>
<P>And thus may the whole degrees be taken out, now for dividing them into Centesmes, they may be equal divisions, and yet very near the truth; or rather first divide the half degrees true by the middle Secant, thus: the half of the Se∣cant of 49<SUP>d</SUP> 15′, shall reach from 49<SUP>d</SUP> to 49<SUP>d</SUP> and a half, and instead of halfing the Secant, it may be taken out to half the Radius, and afterwards the parts of each half degree may be divided equally, and so if you would divide a degree in∣to ten parts, each part will be 6 minutes; and if it were required to finde the true length of the Meridian-line from 49 degrees to 49 degrees 6 minutes, the tenth part of the middle Secant, to wit, of 49 degrees 3 minutes, shall be the
<PB N="44" REF="57"/> length required, and so on successively. And so if it were requi∣red to finde the length of 49<SUP>d</SUP> 7 tenths, or 42′, I say that 7/10 of the middle Secant, to wit, of the Secant of 49 35 Centesms, or 49<SUP>d</SUP> 21′, is the length required.</P>
<P>Now it may be doubted that the making of the Meridian-line by whole degrees, is not near enough the truth, in regard the Ta∣bles at first were made by the adding of the Secants of every mi∣nute successively together; and the learned Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> in stead of adding the Secants of every minute, would have a minute divi∣ded into a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or rather a million of parts, and the Secants of every one of those parts added to∣gether.</P>
<P>To this I answer, That the making of the Meridian-line by whole degrees, and in the whole, doth not breed any error at all to be regarded, compared with the making of it up successively by every minute, and for each particular degree it doth not breed any sensible error, compared with the best Tables.</P>
<P>To the end of this Book we have added a Table of the Meri∣dian-line to every second Centesm, wherein we have supplied the vacuity that is in Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> Table, by which Table it doth ap∣pear that the Meridional parts between the Latitudes of 50 de∣grees and 60 degrees, are 17<SUP>d</SUP> ⌊542, which other Tables make more; and by the adding up of the Secants of 51 degrees 30 minutes, 52 degrees 30 minutes, and so successively to 59 degrees 30 minutes they will amount to 17<SUP>d</SUP>, 547, the difference being onely in the thousandth parts of a degree; and I suppose there are no <HI>Merca∣tors Charts</HI> made, wherein a degree of Longitude is an inch, the biggest, I have seen is but half an inch, and if they were an inch it could scarcely be divided into one hundred parts, much less in∣to a thousand, and so in every part of the Meridian-line as far as it can be used, the difference will be inconsiderable, and so also in the whole.</P>

<P>And for the latter part of the Objection, I hear Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> was making a New Table of them, according to his own minde, wherein it is probable he attained the manner of adding up those Secants by some new Proposition, in regard it would be extreamly tedious to make a Table of Natural Secants to all those parts and then adde them up, wherein he long since desisted upon this consideration, that the decrease would happen in the decimal parts remote from the degrees; for it must be conceived that a Table of the Meridian-line consists of the sum of all the Secants divided by Radius; and thus the Meridional number for the first thousand Centesms, or ten degrees, added up from a Table whose Radius is 1000, amounts to 1005079, and divided by the Radius is 1005, 079, then because we would have a Table to express the Meridian-line in degrees, allowing 100 centesms to a degree, we must divide the former Number by 100, and the Quotient is 10, 05079, which is the very Number in our Tables, saving that our Table is not continued so far by two places; and for the last two figures which are omitted, we added in an Unit in the third place of Decimals, and so when a minute is divided into 100 parts, there will be ten thousand of them in a degree, and the sum of those Secants divided by Radius, must be again divided by ten thousand, so that the decrease, as I said before, will be in the re∣mote, and in a manner useless Decimal parts: for it is to be no∣ted, that a Table added up from whole minutes of Secants, as was Mr. <HI>Wrights,</HI> makes the Meridional parts somewhat too great, as himself grants.</P>
<P>Now in regard the former way of making the Meridian-line, though true enough, may seem to be tedious, as not to be perfor∣med to 80 degrees, without 80 several additions of those porti∣ons or pieces by the Compasses, I thought fit to supply 8 points on the Scale of equal parts in the Frontispiece, which have onely pricks or full points set to them, being indeed the Meridian-line for every 10<SUP>d</SUP> from 0 to 80<SUP>d</SUP>; and thus the Reader may supply them, making 10<SUP>d</SUP> of those lesser parts to be Radius, the distances of these Points from 10<SUP>d</SUP> to 60, are the Secants of the middle La∣titudes between them encreased by 15′.</P>

<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Here I take the Distance between the first and fifth point, being in effect the Meridional parts between 10 degrees and 50 degrees of Latitude, and prick them down from L to A, and then because the Latitude of the <HI>Berbadoes</HI> is 30 de∣grees 20 minutes, or 33 Centesmes more North∣wardly then 10 degrees, we must by Proportion finde the Meri∣dional parts between 10 degrees and 13 degrees 20 minutes of Latitude, thus:</P>

<P>The first line B is Perpendicular, and the rest all lean outward, and these Angles and Distances the Reader will finde the same as we have above expressed, if he goes about to measure them.</P>
<P>The manner of forcing the Meridian-line was thus: Mr. <HI>Sutton</HI> Mathematical Instrument-maker, having one well made, and di∣vided on the edge of a square rod, fitted to half an inch Radius, that is, every degree of Longitude was half an inch, and a larger then that he never made (a Chart made thereto from the Equi∣noctial to 80 degrees of Latitude towards one of the Poles, will require five foot and above nine inches breadth.)</P>
<P>I desired him to paste white Paper over a large Table, and to divide the Degrees of a Quadrant thereon, drawing lines into the Center, which he accordingly did, and then moving the Me∣ridian-line rod too and again till we found it would fit, it seemed to both our judgements, that it might very well be divided from the degrees of the said Quadrant, according to the Distances and Angles here set down, if carefully performed; and though this be not Geometrical, yet it may very well serve for Sea-mens use; and those that may doubt of the truth hereof till they have tried, having one already made, may make another carefully after this manner upon Paper, and then folding the Paper backwards in the lines B, C, D, E, F, lay the folded edges to their graduated line, and finde a good agreement, if performed well.</P>
<P>The Meridian-line is of such general use in Navigation, that indeed without it, or a Table thereof, the true Rumbe between two places cannot be known, a good Reckoning cannot bee kept, and thereby as <HI>Maetius</HI> well observes, the Navigator is in a capacity to sail unto all the coasts or corners of the earth, where∣fore
<PB N="51" REF="60"/> that the Reader might be every way supplyed therewith, we have not onely added in a Table thereof, made to every second Centesm, but likewise a Print from a Brass Plate of a Meridian-line, made to half an inch Radius, so that by doubling or folding that Print (which is made to lye without the Book) upon a Paper or Blank, the Reader may by his Pen easily, without the use of Compasses, graduate the Meridian-line of a Chart for any Voy∣age: And supposing that Seamen will not go to Sea without it, that it may not be cumbersome, they may have it put upon the edges of a square rod of a foot length to put in their pockets, upon which the other Scales of the Plain Scale may be likewise gradua∣ted; or if the Reader would graduate a Meridian-line of a lesser size on his Chart, he may prepare himself a line of equal parts on the sloap edge of a thin Ruler, and laying it by the line in his Chart, on which he would graduate the Meridional Divisions, ea∣sily and conveniently perform it by his Pen, without Compasses, by help of the Meridional Table.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>An Example for finding the Rumbe by the forced Meridian-Line.</HEAD>
<P>Let it be required to finde the Rumbe between the Isle of <HI>St. Helens,</HI> Latitude 16<SUP>d</SUP> South, Longitude 14<SUP>d</SUP>, and the <HI>Berbadoes,</HI> Latitude 13<SUP>d</SUP> 20′ North, Longitude 315<SUP>d</SUP> 40′.</P>
<P>The Meridional parts may be pricked down at thrice, first set 10<SUP>d</SUP> out of the Meridian-line B from AE in the following Scheme, both upwards and downwards, then take from the Meridian-line C to 13<SUP>d</SUP> 20′, and prick from 10 upwards to B in the former Triangle, also take from C in the Meridian Scheme to 16<SUP>d</SUP>, and prick it beneath from 10 to S downwards, then raise S H perpen∣dicular to S B, and make S H equal to 58<SUP>d</SUP> 20′, or 33 Centesms taken out of the line A H of the former Scheme, and draw B H, and it shall be the Rumbe required from the <HI>Berbadoes</HI> to <HI>St. He∣lens,</HI> to wit, the Angle B 63<SUP>d</SUP> 3′ from the Meridian, if measured by former directions, the sum of both Latitudes is 29<SUP>d</SUP> 33 Cen∣tesms, which prick from the same equal parts from B to L, and draw L K parallel to S H, and the extent B K measured on those equal parts, is 64<SUP>d</SUP>, 7 the distance required, which in leagues allowing 20 to a degree, is 1294 leagues; or without drawing
<PB N="52" REF="61"/> the line L K, if you enter the extent B L so that one foot resting in the line B K, as at M, while the other turned about will but just touch S H, then shall H M be the distance as before.</P>
<P>Thus when places are in both Hemispheres, the sum of the Me∣ridional parts in both Latitudes, is the Meridional Leg; but when in the same Hemisphere, the difference of the Meridional parts is the Meridional Leg, and the difference of Longitude in both Ca∣ses the other Leg. The reason of this manner of measuring a Di∣stance in <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> both in this and the former Example, shall afterwards be handled: And note, if you prick down the difference of Latitude in the Meridian in leagues or miles, and draw a Parallel through it, cutting the Rumbe continued, when need requires, you will then finde the measure of the Distance in leagues or miles accordingly.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Another Example, serving to explain the Use of the Table of the Meridian-line, in finding the true Rumbe by any Scale of equal Parts.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Lizard,</HI> Latitude 50<SUP>d</SUP>. <HI>St. Michaels Isle,</HI> Latitude 38<SUP>d</SUP> 00, the difference of Latitude is 12<SUP>d</SUP>, and the difference of Longitude 19 degrees.</P>
<P>Whether this be the true difference of Longitude and Latitude or no, between these places, is not material, as to the explaining of what I am about to say: Let us then suppose these places to be laid down true on a Plain Chart, as to their Latitudes, Course, and Distance, the difference of Latitude is 12<SUP>d</SUP>, and the Distance 18<SUP>d</SUP>, 12, that is about 362 leagues and a half.</P>
<P>Out of any equal parts prick down 12<SUP>d</SUP>, the difference of Lati∣tude from L to M, and raise the Perpendicular M I, and take 18<SUP>d</SUP> 12 Centesms, the Distance out of the same equal Parts, and set∣ting one foot in L, cross the Perpendicular at I, and draw I L, so are these places laid down true in their Distance on a Plain Chart or Blank, as also in their Rumbe the Angle at L, which is 48<SUP>d</SUP> 34′ from the Meridian.</P>
<P>Now let us suppose a Ship to sayl from I to A 151 leagues and a half N N E, and by this reckoning is in the Latitude of 45<SUP>d</SUP>, and now desires to know how the <HI>Lizard</HI> bears, and how far it is di∣stant from the Ship, I say the prickt line A L doth not represent
<FIGURE>
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
</FIGURE> truly neither the Course nor Distance from the Ship to the <HI>Li∣zard:</HI> Again, suppose the Ship to sayl from A to B East South-East 114 leagues and a half, and is now by this Account in the Latitude of 43<SUP>d</SUP>, I say a line drawn from B to I, shall not shew the true Course and Distance from the Ship back to <HI>St. Mi∣chaels,</HI> neither shall a line drawn from B to L, shew the true
<PB N="54" REF="62"/> Course and Distance from the Ship to the <HI>Lizard:</HI> And now he that would remove the Error that is thus committed by reason of the Chart, must for every Course and Distance finde the Differ∣ence of longitude as well as of latitude, as shall follow, and then by having the Meridian line, or a Table thereof, he may remove the Error of the Chart when he pleaseth after the same maner, and as easily as to finde the Rumbe and Distance between the two places at the first.</P>
<P>The Ship at A hath made 3<SUP>d</SUP> 88 Centesems, the difference of Longitude in that Course, which taken out of 19<SUP>d</SUP>, the whole dif∣ference of Longitude there, rests 15<SUP>d</SUP> 12 Centesms.</P>

<P>What is here accomplished by the Tables, may readily be per∣formed by a Meridian-line, out of which with Compasses take the distance between both Latitudes, and prick it from L to∣wards M, at the end whereof raise a Perpendicular, and therein prick down out of the Equinoctial degrees or equal parts, the dif∣ference of Longitude, drawing a line from it to L, which shall pass through the former point O, whatsoever be the Radius where∣to the Meridian-line is fitted; and after the same manner the er∣ror
<PB N="55" REF="62"/> of the Plain Chart is to be removed, when places are at first laid down in it, according to their Longitudes and Latitudes, which is most easily and suddenly done, especially if a Meridian-line on a rod fitted to the degrees of Longitude on the Plain Chart, and the maner of measuring a westwardly distance will be the same as in <HI>Mercators</HI> Chart.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to the Demonstration of <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> it will be necessary to search into the Nature of the Rumbe-line, on the Globe, and to collect what we finde observeable in Forreign Authors to this purpose:</P>
<P N="1">1. They define it to be such a Line that makes the same Angles with every Meridian, through which it passeth, and therefore can be no Arch of a great Circle; for suppose such a Circle to pass through the Zenith of some place not under the Equinoctial, making an oblique Angle with the Meridian, then shall it make a greater Angle with all other Meridians then with that through which it at first passeth, therefore the Rumbe which maketh the same Angles with every Meridian, must needs be a Line curving and bending, which some call a <HI>Helix-Line,</HI> and others, because it is supposed to be on the Surface of the Sphere, a <HI>Helispherical-line.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another Property of the Rumbe-line, is, that it leads nearer and nearer unto one of the Poles, but never falleth into it, and near the Pole it turneth often round the same, in many Spires and turnings.</P>
<P>If by any Rumbe (but not under the Meridian) it were suppo∣sed possible to sayl directly under the Pole point, it would follow that the Meridian-line of <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> should be finite, and not infinite, and that one and the same line should cut infinite o∣ther Lines as such, at equal Angles in a meer point, which is against the nature and definition of a line, and then seeing that the Rumbe derives its definition from the Angle, it makes with the Meridian: the nature and use of a Meridia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under the Pole ceaseth, and con∣sequently the Rumbe ceaseth, for under the Poles no star or other immoveable point of the heavens, doth either rise or set, in refer∣ence whereto the word <HI>Meridian</HI> hath its original, being used to signifie the Mid-day time, or high noon of the Sun, or Star, rela∣ting to their proper Motion; moreover under the Pole point the sides of the Rumbe-triangles in the Sphere cease, wherefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the An∣gles must needs do so too.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Nature of the Triangles made upon the Globe by the Rumbe-Line.</HEAD>
<P>The Rumbe of it self is a curved or bending Line, and therefore how smal a portion soever thereof we assume to be a right Line, in its own nature differs something therefrom, and can by no arti∣fice be precisely reduced thereto, yet the smaller the Portion be thereof, the nearer as to use, it doth approach to a right Line: Let us therefore on the Globe suppose Circles that are parallel to the Equinoctial to pass through every minute of the Meridian, as in the following figure, wherein P may represent the Pole, and all Lines drawn from thence to AE Q, may signifie Meridians, and the Arks <HI>a b, c d, e f,</HI> &amp;c. may represent the Parallels supposed: Then suppose a Rumbe to be traced from the Equinoctial at AE towards
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the Pole, being the prickt curved Line, and through the Points where this Line crosseth the former Parallels, as at AE, <HI>b, d, f, h, k, m,</HI> draw Meridians from the Pole to the Equator AE Q, and there will be divers small Triangles represented to the fancy; for Example, the Triangle AE <HI>a b</HI> right angled at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in which the
<PB N="57" REF="63"/> side AE <HI>b</HI> is the distance in the Rumbe, AE <HI>a</HI> is the difference of Latitude supposed one minute, and <HI>a b</HI> the Departure from the Meridian, which Triangle we take to be a right lined, not a Sphae∣rical Triangle, supposing the sides thereof to be extended into right lines.</P>
<P>And in the whole Rumbe-triangle AE <HI>t m,</HI> the whole distance is AE <HI>m,</HI> the whole difference of Latitude is AE <HI>t,</HI> but the whole Departure from the Meridian is not given in any one Triangle, but in divers Triangles, and is by supposition as much in one Tri∣angle as another, to wit, the whole Departure from the Meridian is the sum of

</LIST> each of which Portions are supposed to be equal each to other, and the whole difference of Longitude is the Arch AE Q, the Segments whereof Q L, Q <HI>s, s r,</HI> cannot be equal to each other, because the Arks or Departures <HI>l m, i k,</HI> &amp;c. are supposed to be equal each to other, not in the same, but in dif∣ferent Parallels of Latitude.</P>
<P>Now then for all uses in Navigation, we suppose the Segments of the Rumbe <HI>m k, k h,</HI> and the rest, to be a right Line, and if we give the Rumbe, to wit, the Angle <HI>l k m,</HI> and the Side <HI>k l,</HI> we may by the Doctrine of Plain Triangles finde the Side <HI>k m,</HI> the distance by the common Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of the Rumbe from the Meridian: Is to the Radius</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Latitude: To the distance</HI> ∷</P>
<P>And from hence we may observe another property in the Rum∣be, as namely, that the Segments or Pieces thereof contained be∣tween two Parallels, having the like difference of Latitude, are also equal to each other, so that the like distance being sayled in the same Rumbe in several parts of the earth, shall cause the like difference or alteration of Latitude in each of those parts.</P>
<P><HI>For Example:</HI> If a Ship sayl from the Latitude of 10<SUP>d</SUP> North-East, till she be in the Latitude of 30<SUP>d</SUP>, and then sayl from thence on the same Rumbe till she be in the Latitude of 50<SUP>d</SUP>, the latter distance shall be equal to the former distance, and the like shall
<PB N="58" REF="64"/> hold from thence to 70<SUP>d</SUP>, and the same also should hold from 70<SUP>d</SUP> to the Pole, if it were possible to sayl thither by any Rumbe, and the reason is, because in the Triangle <HI>k l m</HI> the Angles at <HI>k</HI> and <HI>l,</HI> with the Side <HI>l k,</HI> are equal by construction to the Angles at <HI>h</HI> and <HI>i,</HI> and the Side <HI>i h</HI> in the Triangle <HI>i h k,</HI> and the like in any other Triangle, wherefore if these were given to finde the Side <HI>m k</HI> or <HI>k h,</HI> it must needs be found the same in both.</P>
<P>Again, if in the former Triangle we should give the Rumbe, to wit, the Angle <HI>l k m,</HI> and the difference of Latitude <HI>l k,</HI> we might finde the Departure from the Maridian <HI>l m</HI> by this Pro∣portion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Tangent of the Rumbe,</HI> viz. Tang. <HI>l k m:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Latitude,</HI> 1 minute, to wit, <HI>k l:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Departure from the Meridian</HI> l m ∷</P>
<P>Now because the Unit in the third place doth neither multiply nor divide, it follows that if you divide the Tangent of the Rumbe by the Radius, the Quotient is the Departure from the Meridian, or without such division it may be expressed like a Fraction, thus: <HI>Tang. Rumbe / R,</HI> which signifies that the Tangent of the Rumbe is to be divided by the Radius; and now having the Departure from the Meridian given in any Parallel, we may by another Proportion finde the difference of Longitude agree∣able thereto, and if the same Departure be often scattered amongst many Parallels, as we have before supposed, we may by compoun∣ding that Proportion, finde the sum of all the differences of Lon∣gitude proper to each Parallel, which is the whole difference of <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Longitude required, and must be sup∣posed to be added into one sum before the fancy apprehends by what Legs ei∣ther the common Rumbe to all those Triangles, and the Hipotenusal or Di∣stance AE <HI>m</HI> is subtended.</P>
<P>Now such Proportion as one Circle hath to another such Proportion, have their Degrees, Semi-diameters, and Sines of like Arches one unto ano∣ther.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
<P>As in the former Scheme, A C is the Radius of the Equino∣ctial, and E D is the Radius of a Parallel or lesser Circle, whose Latitude from the Equinoctial is A E, but E D is the Sine of the Ark E B, which is the complement of the Latitude A E.</P>
<P>It therefore holds:</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of the Latitude: Is to the Radius</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Or rather with other tearmes in the same Proportion.</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Secant of the Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is a Mile or any part thereof, or number of Miles:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the difference of Longitude answering thereto</HI> ∷</P>
<P>And because the two first tearms of the Proportion vary not, it will hold after the manner of the Compound rule of three.</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Sum of the Secants of all the parallels or Latitude between any two places:</HI> (and we allow a parallel to pass through every minute or Centesme of a degree)</P>
<P><HI>So is a Mile or any number or part thereof allotted to every Parallel:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the whole difference of Longitude, that is, to the Sum of all the differences of Longitude proper to each Parallel</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Now as we shewed before, the Departure from the Meridian is equally scattered or shared, and allotted the like portion there∣of to every parallel, wherefore in stead of the third tearm above which is the distributed part, we may take in a tearm equivalent thereto that findes it <HI>Tang. Rumbe / Radius,</HI> as we shewed before, then in working the rule of three in mixt Numbers, where the second or third tearm stand in form of a Fraction, the other tearms not being mixt, the Product of the first tearm and Denominator, is the Di∣visor or fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st tearm in another Proportion, and the Numerator and other tearm are the second and third tearms, or their product the Dividend, wherefore by this Composition it followes:</P>
<P><HI>As the Square of the Radius:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Sum of the Secants of all the Parallels between both La∣titudes</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the Rumbe: To the difference of Longitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P>And in stead of the two first tearms, we may say:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the sum of all the Secants between both La∣titudes divided by the Radius:</HI> (which as I have shewed is the very tearm given by the Meridional Table)</P>
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the Rumbe from the Meridian:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the difference of Longitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P>The four tearms of this Proportion being all of a different kinde, may be so inverted in their order, that any three of them being given, the fourth may be found, and so if it were required to finde the Rumbe, the difference of Longitude and Latitude being given, it will hold backward:</P>
<P><HI>As the Meridional parts between both Latitudes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the difference of Longitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius: To the Tangent of the Rumhe</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Wherefore if we make the Meridional parts one Leg of a right angled Triangle, and the difference of Longitude the other, the Meridional parts being assumed or made Radius, the difference of Longitude becomes the Tangent of the Rumbe, and consequent∣ly the Angle between the Meridian and Rumbe-Line, or Hipote∣nusal, measureth the quantity of the Rumbe from the Meridian; and this is the very case and thing done in <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> be∣tween all places, wherefore the truth of that Chart is as much in every respect above all contradiction, as the best Calculation that is as every was published, and we may very well conclude with Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in his <HI>Trigonometry,</HI> page 119. that all or any parts of the world may be set down therein according to their Longi∣tudes, Latitudes, Courses and Distances, as truly and far more conveniently for the Mariners use, then upon the Globe it self, with the which elsewhere he saith it agrees without sensible error; And in the words of its renowned Author Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> we may say it agrees therewith without sensible or considerable error.</P>
<P>Now let us see what can be objected against it: Mr. <HI>Speidel</HI> in his Brief Treatise of <HI>Sphaerical Triangles,</HI> page 48 saith, <HI>That by Mercators Chart in the bearing of two places, there will appear a ma∣nifest error of whole degrees, being compared with the Globe.</HI></P>
<P>And I adde, if this were true, there would also arise a great error in the distance, seeing we have nothing but his bare word for it, it is as easily here denyed, as there affirmed, and it were to be wished he had left us his minde concerning it; if by compa∣ring with the Globe he means it should be the same with the angle of Position, this we deny; for the Rumbe makes the same Angles with both the Meridians of the places between which it is extend∣ed,
<PB N="61" REF="65"/> whereas the Angle of Position at one of the places differs from what it is at the other place: And here note, that a Course sayled under the Meridian, or in a Parallel, is not properly called a Rumbe, for under the former the Ships motion describes a great Circle, and in a parallel a lesser Circle, whereas a Rumbe is no Circle at all, but rather resembles a Spiral-line.</P>
<P>Another Objection may be raised from learned Mr. <HI>Oughtreds Treatise of Navigation,</HI> page 38. at the end of his Circles of Pro∣portion, wherein he makes this one property of the Rumbe, that a Ship sayling therein from one place to another, cannot return back to the first place by the opposite Rumbe: behold the former Scheme wherein in the Triangle <HI>k l m,</HI> suppose a Ship to sayl from <HI>k</HI> to <HI>m,</HI> then is <HI>l k m</HI> the Angle of the Rumbe first kept, be∣ing subtended by the Side <HI>l m;</HI> now if she would sayl back again from <HI>m</HI> to <HI>k,</HI> the Angle of the Rumbe will be <HI>n m k,</HI> a bigger An∣gle then the former, because the Side <HI>k n</HI> that subtends it, is a big∣ger Side, and so that if the Ship should sayl back by the very op∣posite Angle, the Ship would not arrive at <HI>k,</HI> but fall wide of it nearer unto <HI>n.</HI></P>
<P>To which I answer, That this is true in nicety of speculation, for in the right angled Triangle <HI>k l m,</HI> if I give the Side <HI>k l</HI> the difference of Latitude, and the Side <HI>l m</HI> the difference of Lon∣gitude, reduced to the measure of that Parallel, I may by these finde the Distance <HI>k m,</HI> and the Angle of the Rumbe <HI>l k m.</HI> In like manner in the Triangle <HI>m n k,</HI> the Side <HI>m n</HI> is equal to <HI>l k,</HI> but the Side <HI>k n</HI> is greater then <HI>l m,</HI> and is the difference of Lon∣gitude in the given Parallel, whereby we may finde <HI>m k</HI> greater then it was found before, and the Angle of the Rumbe <HI>n m k</HI> grea∣ter then the Angle <HI>l k m;</HI> And so in the whole number of Rum∣be-Triangles in finding the Rumbe, get the Meridional parts be∣tween both Latitudes, by substracting the less from the greater, and thereby finde the Rumbe, this findes the lesser Angle, and includes the most Northwardly, and excludes the most Southward∣ly Parallel.</P>
<P>Again, substract a Centesm or Minute from each Latitude, and then finde the Meridional parts, whereby calculate the Rumbe: this findes the bigger Angle, and excludes the most Northwardly, and includes the most Southwardly Parallel; and thus we may
<PB N="62" REF="66"/> finde how much the inward Angle of the Rumbe differs from the outward, between both which the true Rumbe is a mean; but if the case be put in different Hemispheres, the sum of the Meridio∣nal parts in both Latitudes will finde the lesser Angle, then sub∣stract a minute from the greater, and adde a minute to the lesser Latitude, and with the sum of the Meridional parts proper to both Latitudes thus altered, you may also finde the greater Angle.</P>
<P>The Meridional parts thus found, either way will be so incon∣siderably different, that there will scarce be any sensible differ∣ence between the Rumbe found by each operation, and therefore though the Objection be true in speculation, yet cannot be sensi∣ble in practice, and what difference may thus arise, may be remo∣ved to all possible nearness, if in stead of making a Rumbe trian∣gle to every minute, we should divide a Minute or Centesm into a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a million of Triangles, and adde up the Secants of them according to Mr. <HI>Oughtreds</HI> opi∣nion; but we may say with Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> page 114. that this were a matter more curious then necessary, a Table made to every Mi∣nute or Centesm being so near the truth, that it is not possible by any Rules or Instruments of Navigation to discover any sensible error in the Sea Chart, so far forth as it shall be made according thereto: Secondly, were the Objection more considerable then it is, yet to me it seems a gross absurdity in practice, to affirm that a Ship cannot return by the opposite Rumbe.</P>
<P>Admit a Ship sayl 1000 leagues up a River all the way North-East, he were no less then frantick that should deny that she could return down the same River back again, and then by supposition the Compass did truly point all the way up North-East, how can it be conceived that the other end of the Rumbe-line on the Com∣pass, if we make it a streight line so as to agree with the opposite Coasts of the Horizon, did point at the same time other ways then South-West? or can it be apprehended that the meer winding or tacking about of the Ship to return, should all the way back cause the Compass to point otherwise then it did all the way up? and notwithstanding the Objection, Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> grants, and pleads as much for the truth of <HI>Mercators Chart,</HI> as he doth for the truth of the Calculation delivered by himself and others. Now having shewed the making, and confirmed the truth of that Chart, we
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>

<PB N="64" REF="67"/> proceed to the Uses thereof, and the manner of keeping a Rec∣koning thereon.</P>
<P>Suppose therefore that a Voyage were to be performed from <HI>Tenariff,</HI> Latitude 28<SUP>d</SUP>, Longitude 0, to <HI>St. Nicholas Isle,</HI> Lati∣tude 17<SUP>d</SUP>, Longitude 352<SUP>d</SUP>, the difference of Longitude being 8<SUP>d</SUP>, this Example being the same we used in the Plain Chart, we here retain it with the same Courses and Distances, that the Reader comparing both together, may see how much error is committed by the Plain Chart; to fit a particular Chart hereto, I draw the line T W, and divide it into 8 equal parts or degrees, being in this Chart half an inch each, and then divide every one of those de∣grees into ten lesser parts, then draw the line T S perpendicular, and by folding the printed Cut of the Meridian-line thereto, I graduate the same with a Pen from 28 to 17<SUP>d</SUP> of Latitude; and now to shun the turning of leagues into degrees and Centesms, I divide another line of equal parts W N, making each degree therein twice as large as a degree of Longitude, and so that line becomes a line of inches, and may be made on a loose Ruler; each degree thereof is divided into ten parts, and numbred with as many degrees of Latitude of the Meridian-line, as the Chart would suffer for want of room.</P>
<P>Draw a line from T to N, to represent a Ruler laid over the two places <HI>Tenariff</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Island,</HI> for when we have a Ruler that line need not be drawn.</P>

<HEAD>To Measure the Distance between any two Places in Mercators Chart.</HEAD>
<P>Herein also we shall forsake the common Road, and make no use of the Meridian-line at all, which as it is not used to this pur∣pose in Calculation, so neither need it in any operation upon the Chart, on which we shall observe those Proportions that are used in Calculation, which are but two.</P>
<P><HI>Case</HI> 1. When places differ both in Longitude and Latitude.</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of the Rumbe: Is to the difference of Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius: To the Distance</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Suppose the points R &amp; Q in the Chart were two Islands, where∣of I would measure the distance, supposing these places to be truly placed in the Chart according to their Latitudes and Longitudes, it is necessary to find in what Latitudes both places are: thus, if you take the nearest distance from Q to some Parallel, to wit, K L, and place it in the Meridian-line T S, the right way from that Pa∣rallel you will find that place to be in the latitude of 22<SUP>d</SUP> 5 tenths, and the point R will be found to be in the latitude of 24<SUP>d</SUP> 42 cen∣tesms, get the difference of Latitude, which is one degree and 92 Centesms, which take out of the Scale of Inches, to wit, one inch,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/> and 92 hundred parts of another, and lay a Ruler over the two places R Q, and it will cross the Parallels at the Points K and X, then enter the former extent so by the edge of the Ruler, that one foot resting by it, the other turned about may but just touch some one of the Parallels in the Chart; thus one foot of the Compasses will rest at Y, and the other being turned about will just touch K L, then is the extent K Y the distance in degrees, if measu∣red in the Scale of Inches, to wit, 2<SUP>d</SUP> 31 Centesms; and if you measure the said extent in the line T W, it gives you the distance in leagues, to wit, 46 leagues and a quarter.</P>
<P>And if you have the Scale of leagues graduated on the sloap edge of your Ruler, you may see the distance without measuring any extent; and if the Line of Inches were wanting, you might double the difference of Latitude, and take it out of the Scale T W, and finde the distance the same.</P>
<P>In like manner, if the former extent were so entred, that one foot turned about should just touch <HI>r</HI> X, the Compasses would rest at Z, and the extent Z X would be the same distance as before.</P>
<P>We would have measured the whole Distance between <HI>Tenariff</HI> at T, and <HI>Nicholas Island</HI> at N, but that we are confined to a nar∣row room, and therefore will onely measure one tenth part there∣of: The whole difference of Latitude is 11<SUP>d</SUP>, whereof a tenth part is one degree and a tenth, take one inch and a tenth out of the Scale of Inches, and entring it so that one foot resting by the edge of the Ruler T N, the other turned about may just touch T W, the resting foot will happen at P, and the extent T P mea∣sured on the Scale T W, is 26 leagues and a half, wherefore the whole distance is ten times as much, namely, 265 leagues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Demonstration.</HEAD>
<P>The Angle that the edge of a ruler (or right Line) laid over two places, makes with any Parallel in the Chart, is the Complement of the Rumbe between those places, so the Angle Q K L mea∣sureth the bearing of the Ports R Q from the West, and the An∣gle Q X <HI>r</HI> measureth the same thing from the East, and the en∣tring of the difference of Latitude taken out of some Scale of equal parts, as above, makes it to become the Cosine of the Rumbe, wherefore the Radius thereto K Y, or X Z becomes the distance
<PB N="67" REF="68"/> in the same measure wherein the difference of Latitude was ta∣ken, and so the Proportion before delivered is observed.</P>
<P><HI>Case</HI> 2. The second Case is when two places are both in the same Latitude, and differ onely in Longitude, the Propor∣tion holds:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Cosine of the Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the difference of Longitude: To the Distance</HI> ∷</P>
<P>I said before that we might very well spare the Points of the Compass and Rumbes, wherewith most Chards are filled, and that the Limbe of a Quadrant in some spare place of the Chard would be of good use, in particular for the resolving of this Pro∣position, yet the defect thereof we thus supply.</P>
<P>Prick down 60<SUP>d</SUP> of the Chords from T to H, which Point may be alwayes in a readiness, and now let it be required to measure the distance <HI>r</HI> X in the Latitude of 20<SUP>d</SUP>, the Complement whereof is 70<SUP>d</SUP>, with the Chord of 70<SUP>d</SUP> draw an Arch at <HI>g,</HI> and setting one foot in T, with the Radius T H cross the former Ark at <HI>g,</HI> over which and the point T, lay the edge of a Ruler, then take the ex∣tent <HI>r</HI> X, and place it from T towards W, it reaches to G, the nearest distance from G to the edge of the Ruler, is the distance sought, if measured in the line T W, to wit, 3<SUP>d</SUP> 45 Centesms, where turning it twice over (making every degree to be ten leagues) I shall finde it to be 69 leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Otherwise:</HI></P>
<P>Suppose G to be a place in the Latitude of 28<SUP>d</SUP>, and it were re∣quired to measure the distance thereof from T, with the Sine of 28<SUP>d</SUP> upon <HI>o</HI> as a Center, describe the Ark <HI>q,</HI> and lay the edge of the Ruler so as it may lye over the outward edge of that Ark and T, then take the nearest distance from G to the edge of the Ruler, which being turned twice over in the line T W, you will finde the distance sought to be 65 leagues.</P>
<P>Now we may apprehend how to lay the Ruler without drawing the Ark <HI>q,</HI> so as the Compasses turned about may just touch the edge thereof, and then setting down one foot of the Compasses by the said edge, turn the Ruler about that the edge may be to∣wards G, and take the nearest distance as aforesaid to it, and in Latitudes above 40<SUP>d</SUP> or 45<SUP>d</SUP>, the trouble of turning about the Ruler
<PB N="68" REF="69"/> may be best spared in that Case, with the Sine of the Latitudes Complement, setting one foot at H, lay the ruler over T, so that the other foot turned about may touch the thin sloap edge thereof, and then take the nearest distance thereto, as before.</P>
<P>For places that differ both in Longitude and Latitude, if they bear one from another East or West within a quarter or half a point, it may be truly alledged, that the way of measuring delive∣red in the first Case will be very uncertain, because the Compas∣ses will run along almost in a Parallel to the edge of the ruler, and so cut it very obliquely.</P>
<P>As in Page 6 of the first Part, <HI>Prop.</HI> 5. where C I may rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esent a Westwardly Course and Distance, and C A the difference of Latitude, then doth the Perpendicular A I cut the line C I in the Point I very obliquely, and with uncertainty; for the finding of which with more certainty, the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tent C A was tripled to F, and the extent D B was tripled to G, as was declared in that Scheme.</P>
<P>To which I answer, The distance may be also found as here in the second Case, by the Cosine of the middle Latitude between both places.</P>
<P>And thus if it were required to finde the distance between the points <HI>d</HI> and <HI>f</HI> in the former Chart, by this rule it would be found to be 2<SUP>d</SUP> 98 Centesms, which turned twice over in the Scale T W, is 59 leagues 7 tenths, which is not the true distance, because the Rumbe between these places is above a Point from the East or West, whereas the true distance is 60 leagues 9 tenths; and in this Example the difference of Latitude is 63 Centesms, and though it were four degrees or more, we might first finde the di∣stance by the Cosine of the middle Latitude, and then enlarge it by entring it so by the edge of the ruler laid over the two places, that one foot resting by the sloap edge, the other turned about might but just touch some Meridian, in stead of a Parallel in the former way.</P>
<P>Thus a ruler laid over <HI>d</HI> and <HI>f</HI> cuts the Meridian-line at <HI>u,</HI> and the former extent so entred, one foot of it will rest at <HI>m,</HI> while the other turned about will but just touch T S, then the extent <HI>m u</HI> turned twice over and measured in the line T W, will be 60 leagues 9 tenths the Distance required, the enlargement thus found being but very small as to matter of extent.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
<P>Now we may take a view of what Rules have been formerly delivered for the Measuring of Distances, here we need not recite Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> way, which is not onely troublesom, as not to be per∣formed without two Pair of Compasses, but also uncertain, if the Distance be great.</P>
<P>The Way in use amongst Seamen is to take half of the whole extent between any two places in the Chart, and either to set one foot of the Compasses down in the Meridian-line, at the middle Arch, which is the middle Latitude between both places, or at the middle space or just half between the Latitudes of both places, which always falls somewhat nearer the Pole then the middle La∣titude, and then turn the other foot of the Compasses both up∣wards and downwards, and minde what Arks it crosseth in the Meridian-line, then they count the whole Arch contained be∣tween the places where the moveable foot so crossed, and take that for the whole distance sought.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>Difference of Longitude is 180<SUP>d</SUP>, the extent in the Chart be∣tween two places so scituated, is 182<SUP>d</SUP> 42, the half whereof is 91<SUP>d</SUP> 21, which measured in the Meridian-line from the middle Lati∣tude or Arch, which is 1<SUP>d</SUP> 33, being half the difference of both La∣titudes, and counted towards the greater Latitude, reacheth Northward to 66<SUP>d</SUP> 15 one way, and Southward to 67<SUP>d</SUP> 32 the other way, and so by this reckoning the distance between these places should be 133<SUP>d</SUP>, 47 by the middle Latitude, and 133<SUP>d</SUP>, 98 by the middle space, whereas in truth by Calculation the distance in the Rumbe is much more, to wit, 180<SUP>d</SUP>, 54.</P>
<P>But supposing two places to be in the same Latitude, and to have but 58<SUP>d</SUP>, 33 Centesms difference of Longitude, the example will be the same with one of those before put between the <HI>Berba∣does</HI> and <HI>St. Helens,</HI> and the distance found by the middle Arch or Latitude, is 62<SUP>d</SUP>, 00, and the same by the middle space 61<SUP>d</SUP> 38 cen∣tesms, but should be in truth 64<SUP>d</SUP>, 7.</P>
<P>Also in the former Example between the <HI>Berbadoes</HI> and the <HI>Lizard,</HI> the true distance is 58<SUP>d</SUP>, 54, and by the middle Latitude
<PB N="70" REF="70"/> or Arch is 58<SUP>d</SUP>, 7, but by the middle space it is 57<SUP>d</SUP>, 66.</P>
<P>Also in the Example between the <HI>Bermudas</HI> and the <HI>Lizard,</HI> the true distance was found to be 44<SUP>d</SUP>, 31 Centesms, by the mid∣dle Arch or Latitude it is 45<SUP>d</SUP>, 13 Centesms, and by the middle space it is 44<SUP>d</SUP>, 97 Centesms.</P>
<P>Where places are in the same Latitude or Parallel, the Com∣passes must be set down in the Meridian-line at the Latitude gi∣ven, and the half extent applyed both upwards and downwards, as before; and if the distance be large, the measure thereof will be much more erronious then when the Rumbe lyes nearer the Meridian.</P>

<P>From which Examples we may observe, that a large Distance cannot be so certainly measured in the Meridian-line as a small one, whereof Mr. <HI>Wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght</HI> was very sensible, and therefore pre∣scribes Rules for the measuring of a small part of the Distance at a time, and argues for the truth thereof; but where the whole ex∣tent between two places is not above ten of the degrees of Lon∣gitude, I see nothing to the contrary, but that it may well enough be measured in the Meridian-line; and so for a great distance we may measure a tenth, or a twentieth part of the whole, and by multiplying the known part, finde the whole; for the ready per∣forming whereof another Scale of equal parts, whereof the de∣grees
<PB N="71" REF="70"/> are twice as large as those in the Scale of Longitude, will be of much conveniency and ease.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI> Suppose it were required to measure the distance be∣tween the Points <HI>f</HI> and <HI>d</HI> in the former Chart, take the same di∣stance, and measuring it in the inches, finde how much it is, to wit, 1 Inch 61 Centesm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, then take the same number out of the Scale of Longitude, and setting one foot at the middle Latitude, to wit, 19<SUP>d</SUP> 18 Centesms, the other will reach Northwards to 20<SUP>d</SUP> 69 Centesms, and Southwards to 17<SUP>d</SUP> 64 Centesms, the difference of which two Arks is 3<SUP>d</SUP>, 05 the distance sought, which allowing 20 leagues to a degree, is 61 leagues, as before, and this is more easily done, then to take the half of any extent, and by the same reason you may finde the middle space between both Latitudes. So also when you would measure the tenth part of a great distance, measure the whole extent in the Scale of Longitudes, and take the twentieth part found by the pen or memory, out of the said Scale, and set it at the middle Latitude, or middle Space, turning the other foot in the Meridian-line, both upwards and downwards, and the degrees so intercepted, will be the tenth part of the whole di∣stance. Now the taking of the twentieth or fortieth part of an Extent is easily done, by help of these two Scales of equal parts; Suppose I would finde the twentieth part of 3 inches or degrees in the greater Scale, I say 3 of the small parts in the lesser Scale is the length required, and so the twentieth part of 3 inches 5 tenths is three and a half of the smaller parts in the lesser Scale, and the half of that is the fortieth part of the whole. I need not insist fur∣ther upon these ways of measuring, seeing I have before delivered others, which as they are more ready in the practise, so also they are built upon better foundations.</P>

<P>The Ships second Traverse is 80 Leagues West South West, which I take out of the West line T W on the Chart, and place it in the Traverse-quadrant from C to B upon the sixth Point, the nearest distance from B to C W, I place in the line of Inches from the Point A to the Point B, and thereby I see that the Ships Latitude now is 23<SUP>d</SUP>, 7, at which in the South Meridian I set the figure 2, and take the distance in the said line between it and the figure 1, and enter this extent so upon the sixth Point in the Tra∣verse-quadrant at <HI>b,</HI> that the Compasses turned about will but just touch C W, and the nearest distance from <HI>b</HI> to C S, is the differ∣ence of Longitude required, which I prick in the West line from 1 to 2, and upon the point 2 in the South line, with the extent T 2 taken out of the West line, draw a small Ark near <HI>b,</HI> and then taking the extent T 2 out of the South line, setting one foot upon 2 in the West line, with the other I cross the former Ark at <HI>b,</HI> and there is the point of the Ships second Traverse.</P>
<P>The third Traverse is South and by East, half a point Eastward∣ly 53 leagues, this distance I take out of the West line Scale, and enter it in the Traverse-quadrant from C to D, on a point and a half from the Meridian, the nearest distance from D to C W, I should prick in the Scale of Inches from B to C, but because I have not room, I have continued the said Scale of Inches apart by it self, in page 73. and this extent reaches from B to C, and now I see I am in latitude 21<SUP>d</SUP> 17 centesms, at which I set the figure 3 in the South line of the Chart T S, and having taken the distance be∣tween it and the figure 2, I enter it so in the Traverse-quadrant on the Rumbe sayled, that one foot resting thereon as at <HI>d,</HI> the other turned about will but just touch C W, then the nearest di∣stance from <HI>d</HI> to C S, is the difference of Longitude required, which I prick in the West line T W from 2 to 3 Eastwardly, because the Course run Eastwardly; with T 3 of the West line, setting one foot at 3 in the South line, I draw an Ark at <HI>c:</HI> again, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h T 3 of the South line, setting one foot at 3 in the West line, I cross the former Ark at <HI>c,</HI> and there is the point of the Ships place from which it is desired to know how <HI>St. Nicholas Island</HI> bears, which by former directions is 38<SUP>d</SUP> 37′ to the Westward of the South, and the Distance thither will be 106 leagues and 6 tenths.</P>

<P>The Course will be found to be 29<SUP>d</SUP> 23′ to the Westwards of the South.</P>

<P>From the point <HI>c,</HI> the Ship sailes directly South 33 Leagues 4 Tenths, which I take out of the west-line, and prick in the loose Scale of Inches from C to D, whereby I see the Ship is now in the Latitude of 19<SUP>d</SUP> and a half, or 5 tenths, at which in the Meridian line of the Chart, I set the figure 4, and because the Longitude is not altered, I write 4 in the West-line also over the figure 3, and by help of these two Points plat the point <HI>d,</HI> as was done before.</P>
<P>And now lastly, it is desired to know what Course and Distance I should steere to bring the Ship to beare from the Point S in the Chart, 45 Leagues North-west and by North.</P>
<P>To perform this, we must finde a point in the Chart that shall have the bearing and distance required, the Course assigned is 3 Points from the Meridian, wherefore take 45 Leagues out of the West Scale, and enter it in the third Point of the Traverse-qua∣drant from C to F, and the nearest distance from F to C W mea∣sured on the Scale of Inches, shews that the difference of Lati∣tude is 1<SUP>d</SUP> 87 Centesms, which I count in the South or Meridian-line from S Northward, and set the figure 5 thereto, from which take the distance to S, and enter it in the Traverse-quadrant on the thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d point, that one foot resting thereon as at <HI>f,</HI> the other tur∣ned about may but just touch C W, and the nearest distance

<P>The maner of finding the difference of Longitude for a Course that lies East or West, was instanced in finding the point <HI>e,</HI> or it may be found with more certainty for Courses near the East or West, after the manner shewed in Page 32. Or having found the Departure from the Meridian first, make use of the Cosine of the middle Latitude, and with the Departure finde the difference of Longitude required, as you found the point <HI>e,</HI> or do it by the pen, as we shall afterwards shew, and then prick it down; or lastly it may be done in a Scheme apart, by this Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Secant of the Rumbe from the East or West:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Distance run</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Secant of the middle Latitude:</HI></P>

<P>Admit a Ship sayl West and by South 3 degrees or 60 leagues from Latitude 41<SUP>d</SUP>, now by the dead reckoning she is in Latitude 38<SUP>d</SUP> 6 Centesms, the middle Latitude is 39<SUP>d</SUP> 53 Centesms: And let it be required to finde the difference of Longitude proper to this Course.</P>
<P>This we insist upon, because when a Course lyes nearer the East or West then a point, it cannot be so certainly found by the Tra∣verse-quadrant, because the Compasses will cross that Rumbe very obliquely, having drawn the Quadrant A B C, prick the Course 11<SUP>d</SUP> 15′ from B to H, and draw C H, on it prick down 3<SUP>d</SUP> out of the West Scale in the Chart from C to F, and draw F D parallel to C A, then count the middle Latitude 39<SUP>d</SUP> 53 Cen∣tesms,
<PB N="78" REF="74"/> or 31′, from B to E, and draw C E, then is the extent C G the difference of Longitude required, to wit, if measured in the former Scale 3<SUP>d</SUP> 81 Centesms, and when the line C E falls above D, continue I D far enough.</P>

<P>C I being Radius, C F is the Secant of the Rumbe from the East or West to that Radius, and it is also the Distance run, then also by the proportion of equality, C G being the Secant of the middle Latitude, it is also the difference of Longitude required; So also the Course being East or West, if C I being the distance be made Radius, then is C G the Secant of the Latitude to that Radius, the difference of Longitude required, but in this Scheme C I is the Departure from the Meridian in the former Course, which being given, neither the Rumbe nor Distance (both placed in the line C H) are necessarily required. And this I think suf∣ficient to explain the Use of Mr. <HI>Wrights</HI> excellent Sea-Chart, commonly called <HI>Mercators,</HI> because <HI>Mercator</HI> a Dutchman, ha∣ving obtained the making of the Chart from Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> was the first that made Maps of the World upon that kinde of Projection.</P>

<P>We have hitherto kept a Reckoning upon both Charts, which might as well have been done upon some fitted Traverse-board, and thence removed into the Chart, as oft as it should be thought needful; And for the Preservation of the Chart it may also be noted, that a Course and Distance on either Chart may be measu∣red without the use of Compasses, by the joynt help of a Ruler, having equal parts on the edge, of the same size as those we use for a Scale of Leagues, and also of a Semicircle (or Quadrant) of the Compass, printed in page 6, being cut through the Center, and near to the outward Divisions of the Limbe, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then laying the Ruler over any two places in the Chart, bring the Diameter of the Semicircle to lye along by the edge of the Ruler, so that the Center thereof may lye upon some Meridian, and the said Meri∣dian passing under the Semicircle, it will be easily seen by view what Arch of the Semicircle is contained between the edge of the Ruler and that Meridian, which measureth the quantity of the Rumbe.</P>
<P>Then for the Distance count the difference of Latitude in some Meridian, suppose W N of the latter Chart above some Parallel drawn therein, as namely, above <HI>r</HI> B, suppose it ends at N, there set the Center of the Semicircle, so that the same degree of the Limbe thereof may lye over the Meridian underneath, as it did before in measuring the Rumbe, then lay the Ruler along by the Radius of the Semicircle, so that the beginning of the Rulers di∣visions may be at the Center, and the distance from the Center of the Ruler to the Parallel (<HI>r</HI> B) above which the difference of La∣titude was counted, being measured by view on the Ruler, sheweth the Distance required.</P>

<HEAD>OF Sayling by the Arch of a GREAT CIRCLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE foundation of this kinde of sayling supposeth a great Cir∣cle, whose Center is the same with the Center of the Sphere, to pass through any two places propounded, the Arch of which great Circle on the Surface of the Sphere, is always somewhat less then the distance between the two places in the direct Rumbe that leads from the one to the other: Moreover, this great Arch makes several and different Angles with every Meridian, whereas the Rumbe always maketh the same Angle. Now the chief benefit of this kinde of sayling, is, that in an Eastwardly or Westwardly Course we may often shift the Latitude with good advantage, both in respect of time and way, and thereby be the better enabled to correct the Dead Reckoning: Now as he that on a Globe or a true Projection of the Sphere, would draw a line resembling the Rumb that passeth between any two places, must finde the Longitudes and Latitudes of many points through which it passeth, and then by the best diligence he can draw a bending line through all those Points, so also they that would draw a line in <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> re∣sembling the great Arch which passeth between any two places, must finde the Longitudes and Latitudes of many Points through which it passeth, and then through all those Points in the Chart draw a curved line, which shall represent the great Arch, and being drawn, are to sayl as near it as they can, finding the respective
<PB N="81" REF="75"/> Courses and Distances by which they are to sayl before the Rumb, doth vary considerably, whereas in truth it doth vary continually, though not very much in a reasonable run.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> doth give all the Longitudes and La∣titudes through which the Rumbe between any two places laid down thereon doth pass, which may also be found by this Pro∣portion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Meridional parts between both Latitudes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the whole difference of Longitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So are the Meridional parts be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ween one of the Latitudes first gi∣ven, and any other Latitude between both places:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the difference of Longitude answering to the assigned interme∣diate Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P>And by altering the order of the Proportion, if the difference of Longitude were given, we might finde the Latitude answerable thereto; So likewise there are Projections of the Sphere which will give the Longitudes and Latitudes through which the great Arch doth pass, and from whence also we may raise Proportions for finding the same exactly by Calculation or Instruments, if the Geometrical performance be thought either troublesom, or not exact enough.</P>
<P>Because the Stereographick Projection doth very plainly repre∣sent the Triangles on the Sphere, we shall therefore put one in∣stance upon that Projection.</P>
<P>Let there be two places, the one is 50<SUP>d</SUP> North Latitude, as is the <HI>Lizard,</HI> the other in 36<SUP>d</SUP> 00′ South Latitude, and let the dif∣ference of Longitude between them be 68<SUP>d</SUP> 30′.</P>
<P>First it is required to draw the great Arch in that Projection, and then to finde the greatest Latitude or Obliquity thereof, and the Distance in the said Arch, and thirdly to finde what Latitude it passeth through at 10<SUP>d</SUP> difference of Longitude from the place in South Latitude.</P>
<P>First with 60<SUP>d</SUP> of the lesser Chord in the following Scheme, de∣scribe the outward Circle, and draw P S the Axis, and AE Q the Equinoctial, at right Angles; Prick off the South Latitude 36<SUP>d</SUP> from AE to T, and from Q to A. Prick 68<SUP>d</SUP> 30′, the difference of Longitude twice from S to D, a ruler over P and D, cuts the ex∣tended Equator at the Center of the Meridian of the <HI>Lizard,</HI>

<P>Now to measure the greatest Latitude of it, a Perpendicular must be let fall from the Pole upon it, therefore where this Arch crosseth the Equinoctial as at H, is the Pole of the said Perpendi∣cular: now to finde the Center wherewith to draw it, lay a ruler over P and H, and it cuts the Limbe at K, prick S K upward from K to <HI>a,</HI> and a ruler over P and <HI>a,</HI> will cut the Equator, being con∣tinued at the Center of the said Perpendicular, where setting one foot, with the other describe the prickt Ark P <HI>e</HI> S.</P>
<P N="1">1. A ruler over H and <HI>e,</HI> cuts the Limbe at O, and the Arch Q O being 59<SUP>d</SUP> 56′, is the greatest Latitude of the Arch, being the obliquity required.</P>

<HEAD>Some Observations from the former Scheme.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. That if those places be supposed to be both in one Hemi∣sphere, and to have the Complement of the former difference of Longitude to a Semicircle, one &amp; the same great Arch is still com∣mon, and the distance is the Complement of the former distance to a Semicircle, as is evident in the Triangle P L A, in which the Angle L P A is the Complement of the former difference of Lon∣gitude to a Semicircle, and the Arch L A is the complement of L B the former Distance, and the lesser Vertical Angle is common to both Triangles.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the right Angled Triangle A Q E hath its Sides and Angles equal to the Sides and Angles of the Triangle B AE H, and therefore the Arch A E passeth through the like Latitudes in the North Hemisphere, that the Arch H B doth in the South.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in any right Angled Spherical Triangle if it have one obtuse Angle, it hath also the Leg opposite to that Angle, and the Hipotenusal greater then Quadrants, and the contrary, and the other Leg will be less then a Quadrant, and subtend an acute Angle.</P>
<P>And that in stead of resolving such a Triangle we may, and actually do in Calculation, resolve a right Angled Triangle, in which all the parts besides the right Angle, are less then Qua∣drants; This is evident in the two Triangles <HI>f</HI> W S and <HI>f e</HI> P, in which the right Angle at <HI>e</HI> and W, the Angle at <HI>f</HI> and the Perpen∣dicular P <HI>e,</HI> or S W, is common to both Triangles.</P>
<P>But the Sides

<P>This being fore-noted, because these Arkes are tedious and troublesome to draw, we shall handle in the next place a proje∣ction in Tangent lines, on the which, albeit we cannot project an entire Hemisphere, yet all may be very well thence supplyed.</P>

<PB N="85" REF="77"/> 5<SUP>d</SUP> difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, then must the Arch O N be divided into every fifth degree from <HI>o,</HI> but more certainly prick the Radius in the Perpendicular from P to C, and draw C D parallel to A T; and thereto laying the Tangents on your ruler, prick down every fifth degree from C to D, then lay∣ing the beginning of your Tangents over P, and every one of those graduations, you may by the view see what Latitude the Arch passeth through at every 5 degrees difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, for which purpose the Tangents on your ruler may be double numbred both with the Arch and its complement to which they belong.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> Laying the Ruler over 25 degrees, it cuts the Arch at <HI>e,</HI> and the extent P <HI>e</HI> being measured on the Tangents, is 41<SUP>d</SUP> 51′, being the complement of the Latitude of the Arch at that diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of Longitude, wherefore the Latitude of the Arch at 25<SUP>d</SUP> difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, is 48<SUP>d</SUP> 9′.</P>

<P>Thus we see this Projection will supply all the Cases that can be put, and is in effect no other then a Scheme for the carrying on of Proportions, and the Sphere; being thus reduced into right lines, we may thence raise Proportions for Calculating all that is requi∣red. In the oblique-angled plain Triangle T P L, we have the two Sides T P and P L given, being the Tangents of the complements of both Latitudes, and the Angle comprehended T P L given, now we finde the other Angles at T and L by this Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the sum of the two Sides: Is to their difference</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the half sum of the opposite Angles:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of half their difference</HI> ∷</P>
<P>which Proportion is demonstrated in many Books of <HI>Trigonome∣trie;</HI> And so the two Sides of this Triangle are the Tangents of the Complements of the Latitudes.</P>
<P><HI>But as the sum of the Tangent of any two Arkes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the difference of those Tangents</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the sine of the sum of those Arkes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the sine of the difference of those Arkes:</HI></P>
<P>See this demonstrated in Mr. <HI>Newtons Trigonometria Brittanica.</HI></P>
<P>Again the third tearm being the Tangent of the half sum of the opposite Angles, in other Language is the Cotangent of half the contained Angle.</P>
<P>Lastly, the half sum of the unknown Angles being added to their half difference, the sum makes the greater, and the difference the lesser of those unknown Angles. In like manner if the said half difference be added to half the contained Angle, the sum is the greater of those Angles next the Perpendicular, and the difference is the lesser, and these Angles we call the <HI>Vertical Angle.</HI></P>
<PB N="89" REF="79"/>
<P>The Proportion for finding the Perpendicular, having the Hi∣potenusal or Colatitude, and the Vertical Angle given, is:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Cosine of the Vertical Angle</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Cotangent of the Latitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Targent of the Perpendicular</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Then ass gning the difference of Longitude from the Perpendi∣cular, we nave before set down the Proportion for finding the Arks Latitude, and both these Proportions may be brought into one, and so the Method of Calculation arising out of these Con∣siderations, suns thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. For a Parallel or East and West Course.</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of half the difference of Longitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Tangent of the common Latitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Cosine of the Ark of Longitude from the Perpendicular:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of the Arks Latitude answering thereto</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Again, in all other Cases for the Vertical Angles.</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of the sum of the Complements of both Latitudes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Sine of their difference</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the Complement of half the difference of Longitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of half the difference of the Vertical Angles</HI> ∷</P>
<P>which Ark thus found.</P>
<P>Adde to half the difference of Longitude, the sum is the great∣er Vertical Angle, which if it exceed the difference of Longitude, the Perpendicular falls without, and this Ark comprehends the whole Angle between the Perpendicular and both Colatitudes, the difference between the fourth Proportional Ark and half the diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of Longitude, is the Angle between the lesser Colati∣tude and the Perpendicular, being the lesser Vertical Angle.</P>
<P>When one place is in South Latitude, and the other in North, the first and second tearms of this general Proportion change pla∣ces, and the Sine of the sum becomes the Sine of the difference, and this that, as will be found if you make one of the contain∣ing Sides greater then a Quadrant, the Polar distance in stead of the Colatitude, and then for the Sine of an Ark greater then a Quadrant, take the Sine of that Arks complement to a Semicir∣cle, which may sometimes happen when both places are in one He∣misphere, if the sum of the Complements exceed 90 degrees.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="80"/>
<P>Secondly, the Latitudes of the great Ark are found by this Pro∣portion, which is in a manner the same as for a Parallel Course.</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of either of the Vertical Angles, but rather the lesser:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the tangent of the latitude of that place to which it is adjacent</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Cosine of the Ark of difference of Longitude from the Per∣pendicular:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of the Arks Latitude sought</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Thus by this excellent Method of Calculation we dispatch that at two Operations, which Master <HI>Norwood</HI> and others do not attaine under seven or eight, which rendred the Sayling by the great Arch so difficult and laborious, that none cared to practise it. And this latter Proportion having two fixed tearms in it, will be performed on a Serpentine-line, or Logarithmical Ruler, with∣out altering the Index or Compasses, which Proportion being va∣ried, is carried on in the former Scheme:</P>
<P><HI>As the Secant of either of the Vertical Angles:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Cotangent of the Latitude ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acent thereto</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Secant of the difference of Longitude from the Perpendi∣cular:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Cotangent of the Arks Latitude sought</HI> ∷</P>
<P>In the former Scheme making the Perpendicular P A Radius, P T becomes the Secant of the Vertical Angle T P A to that Radius, and is also by construction the Tangent of the Comple∣ment of the Latitude next that Angle, to another Radius, then by reason of the Proportion of Equality, which we have formerly handled, the Secant of any other Angle from the Perpendicular to the former Radius, as is P <HI>e,</HI> shall be also the Cotangent of the Arks Latitude to the latter Radius.</P>
<P>Also the former Scheme shews us how to delineate Proportions in Sines and Tangents, by framing of right-lined oblique Trian∣gles; for as the Sine of the Angle at L is to its opposite Side T P a Tangent, so is the Sine of the Angle at T to its opposite Side P L another Tangent; and by the like reason Proportions in Sines a∣lone, or in Equal parts and Sines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be carried on in the Angles and Sides of Plain Triangles.</P>
<P>Of the six parts of a right-angled Spherical Triangle, no more but four at a time can be laid down in right Lines and Angles.</P>
<P>As in the right-angled Triangle P A T, to wit, the right Angle
<PB N="91" REF="80"/> at A, the Hipotenusal P T, the Perpendicular P A, and the Ver∣tical Angle between T P A, so that the Angle at T being the Complement of the Vertical Angle, is not the Angle of Position in the Sphaere, nor is the Side A T the measure of the Distance on that side the Perpendicular, however both these Arks may be easily found.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Example for the Distance.</HEAD>
<P>Prick the Radius of the Tangents from A to B, and place the extent, B P, being the Secant of the Perpendicular from A to E, from whence lines drawn to L and T, shall contain an Angle e∣qual to the Distance between the <HI>Lizard</HI> and <HI>Trinity Harbour</HI> in the great Arch; To measure it, with 60<SUP>d</SUP> of the Chords, setting one foot at E, draw K M, which extent measured in the Chords sheweth the Distance to be 50<SUP>d</SUP> 9′ at 20 leagues to a degree, is 1003 leagues, the Rumbe between these two places is 74<SUP>d</SUP> 17′ from the Meridian, and the Distance of the Rumbe 1034 leagues, and after the same manner any part of it may be measured; and so likewise might the parallel Distance I V, which if we had room would be found to be 55 degrees and a half; Also the Distance I T would be found to be 74<SUP>d</SUP> 7′, the Complement whereof to a Semicircle being 105<SUP>d</SUP> 53′, would be the Distance between the <HI>Lizard</HI> and <HI>Trinity Harbour,</HI> as we supposed them, the one in South, the other in North Latitude.</P>
<P>The Proportion carried on to finde the Distance, is:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Sine of the Perpendicular</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the Vertical Angle:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of the Distance</HI> ∷</P>
<P>The Perpendicular A P is a Tangent to the Radius A B, and if we make the extent B P Radius, it then becomes a Sine, as is evident if you describe an Ark from P therewith; which R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dius if we should place from P outward beyond C, and suppose a Tangent erected thereon parallel to A T, then doth the extent A T become the Tangent of the fourth Proportional to that Radius, which that it might be measured, the Radius was pricked from A to E.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>To finde the Angle of Position.</HEAD>
<P>If the Hipotenusal and one Legg be given, the Proportion to finde the Angle next that Legg, would be:</P>
<PB N="92" REF="81"/>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Tangent of the Hipotenusal</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of the given Legg:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Cosine of its adjacent Angle</HI> ∷</P>
<P>And so in the former Scheme, if we make T P Radius, which is also the Tangent of the Hipotenusal, then doth P A being the Tangent of the given Leg, become the Sine of the Angle P T A, which is the Complement of the Angle T P A; whence we may observe, that if a Perpendicular be raised at the end of the Tan∣gent of the given Leg, the Tangent of the Hipotenusal being from the other end of the said Leg made the Hipotenusal opposite to the right Angle, the Angle included shall be the Angle sought; therefore having the Distance or Leg A T given, with its Radius A E, you may proportion out the Hipotenusal to that Radius, and with it setting one foot in T, cross A E with the other, from whence drawing a line to T, the Angle between it and A T, shall be the Angle of Position required.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Otherwise more readily:</HEAD>
<P>Take the nearest distance from C to T P, and it shall be the Cosine of the Angle of Position, if we make E A Radius; where∣fore upon A describe the prickt Ark <HI>n,</HI> a ruler from the Center E just touching it, cuts the Ark <HI>x n</HI> at <HI>n,</HI> which Ark measured on the Chords is 38<SUP>d</SUP> 49′, the complement whereof being 51<SUP>d</SUP> 11′ is the Angle of Position required, and so may all the other Angles of Position be found, if there were any need of them. The Propor∣tion carried on, is:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Sine of the Vertical Angle:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Cosine of the Perpendicular:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Cosine of the Angle of Position</HI> ∷</P>
<P>If we make B P Radius, then is A B the Cosine of the Per∣pendicular to that Radius, and the nearest distance from C to T P, is the Cosine of the Angle of Position to the Radius E A.</P>
<P>Thus we have shewed the use of this Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection in more parti∣culars then the Sea-man shall have occasion to use.</P>
<P>Lastly it may be noted, that in stead of pricking down a new Line of Tangents from the Perpendicular in every question that shall be put, that if the Perpendicular be placed in the Side P L, and thence the great Ark raised perpendicularly, as also a Line of Tangents to the common Radius, at the distance of the Radius

<P>THe former Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection for places near the Equinoctial growes infinite and inconvenient, if therefore, as before, we suppose the eye at the Center of the Earth, and place a plain Parallel to the Axis, touching the Equinoctial in some point, then will the Equinoctial it self from that point be projected on each side in a Tangent-line, all the Meridians in that plain will be parallel to each other, and are Tangent-lines of several Radii, the Radius of each of which is the Secant of that Meridians distance from the touch point, any other great Circle passing through the Eye, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll on that Plain be projected in a right line. The Angle that every great Circle makes with the Equinoctial, I call the <HI>Obliquity of that Circle:</HI> thus the Angle of the Ecliptick and Equinoctial being measuted by the Suns greatest declination, is called <HI>the Obliquity of the Ecliptick;</HI> if this Plain toucheth the Equinoctial at the Meridian of the greatest Obliquity of any other Arch, then will the eye project the said Arch on this Plain in a right line, paral∣lel to the Equinoctial, which being measured on their Secants, will all fall in the Circumference of a Circle; And though all this might be handled as a Projection, yet for brevity I shall onely shew you that a Scheme so made doth carry on the former Pro∣portion for Calculating the Latitudes of the great Arch, and therefore one Quadrant onely may, and will supply all Cases whatsoever.</P>
<P>In the following Scheme, the line Q P is divided into a Line of Tangents, describe the Quadrant A R, and through every fifth degree of it draw lines from the Center, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in stead of diving such a Quadrant, you may by the edge of the Ruler divide the lines A B and R B, each of them into a Tangent of 45<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>

<P>In all Cases we take the Line <HI>p</HI> Q to represent the Perpendi∣cular, through 50<SUP>d</SUP> of the Tangents, draw the parallel of Latitude L E parallel to the Equinoctial Q AE, and in the Quadrant count half the difference of Longitude from A, to wit, 35<SUP>d</SUP>, and draw a line meeting with the parallel of Latitude at E, with the extent Q E draw the Arch E G, and it shall represent half the great Arch required; the nearest distance from <HI>a</HI> to Q E measured on the Tangent-line Q <HI>p,</HI> is 51<SUP>d</SUP> 49′, and so much is the Latitude of

<P>And to save the trouble of taking out these Extents, and then measuring them, having the line of Tangents on the sloap edge of a ruler, you may slide it along perpendicularly to Q R, keeping the beginning of the Tangents always upon that line, and as it meets with the Ark at every fifth degree difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, you will see without trouble what Latitudes the Arch passeth through; and if no Line of Tangents be at hand, then the nearest distances from every fifth degree in the Arch to the Equinoctial line AE Q, may be placed on the Perpendicular Q P, and setting one foot in R, if with R Q you describe an Arch, as in page 28 of the First Part, by a ruler over R, and each Tangent placed on the Perpendicular, you may measure the Arks Latitude by a Line of Chords.</P>

<P>If one place be under the Equinoctial, and the other towards one of the Poles, the Latitude of the said place is the obliquity required; and therefore with the Tangent of the Latitude the Arch is to be described.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Places otherwise laid down.</HEAD>
<P>THis way of laying down the great Arch by it greatest obliqui∣ty, is universal, and when the first Projection is inconvenient in finding the Perpendicular, and thence the Obliquity, one of the Vertical Angles must be found, which being drawn in the Qua∣drant from the Center, where it meets with the parallel of Lati∣tude, gives a point passing through which the great Arch is to be drawn upon the common Center Q: Now this Vertical Angle may be either found on the former Scheme, or in an oblique plain Triangle, one side whereof sought shall be the Tangent of the half difference of the Vertical Angles, or in a Circular Scheme, as shall afterwards follow, by carrying on the Proportion before de∣livered for Calculating the same either of these three ways; it would be too long to insist upon all, and by varying the Propor∣tion used for finding the distance in the former Projection, it may also be found in this.</P>
<P>The former Scheme, albeit it may be demonstrated from Pro∣jecting the Sphaere, yet it may be more easily and speedily done
<PB N="98" REF="84"/> by shewing that it carries on the Proportions in Sines and Tan∣gents before delivered for Calculating the Latitudes of the Arch, we need onely give one instance for places in the same Latitude.</P>
<P>The Arch G E in the former Scheme, is one of the Vertical Angles, or half the difference of Longitude for two places in the Latitude of 50<SUP>d</SUP>, whose difference of Longitude is 70<SUP>d</SUP>: the near∣est distance from E to Q R, is the Cosine of half the difference of Longitude, making Q G Radius, which by construction is made equal to the Tangent of 50<SUP>d</SUP>, the common Latitude to another Radius, wherefore by reason of the Proportion of Equality, the Cosine of any Ark from the Perpendicular to the former Radius, to wit, the nearest distance from <HI>a</HI> to Q R, being the Cosine of 5<SUP>d</SUP> difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, is therefore equal to the Tangent of the Arks Latitude sought, to the latter Radius, proper to the given difference of Longitude, wherefore the Proportion is duly observed.</P>
<P>When the Obliquity or greatest Latitude is very great, it will be inconvenient to draw it the former way, this commonly hap∣pens when places differ much in Latitude, but little in Longitude, however generally places may be laid down otherwise on the lat∣ter Projection.</P>
<P>First if their difference of Longitude be less then 90 or 85 de∣grees, they may be laid down without finding either of the Ver∣tical Angles, by supposing this Plain to touch the Equinoctial for most conveniency at the Meridian of the greatest Latitude; and if they be in different Hemispheres, then may the Parallels be continued below AE Q.</P>
<P>But if their difference of Longitude be more then 90<SUP>d</SUP>, they may after the same maner be laid down by the difference of their Vertical Angles, whether they be in the same or both Hemi∣spheres, as in the Projection first handled, the Angle V P T be∣ing the difference of the Vertical Angles, doth as well help us to draw the great Ark T V I, as if the Angle I P T were given, be∣ing the difference of Longitude greater then a Quadrant.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI> Suppose I would finde the Latitudes of the great Arch between the <HI>Lizard</HI> in 50<SUP>d</SUP> of Latitude, and the <HI>Bermudas</HI> in Latitude 32<SUP>d</SUP> 25′, being both in the North Hemisphere, the difference of Longitude being 55<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<PB N="99" REF="84"/>
<P>To lay down these places, draw the Parallel AE B passing tho∣row the Tangent of 55 degrees, on which making the Secant of that Ark Radius, the Tangent of 32<SUP>d</SUP> 25′ is to be pricked down, to take out that Tangent to the said Radius.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Note, That the line Q <HI>k</HI> passing through 55<SUP>d</SUP> of the Quadrant, counted from C, being continued till it meet with the Radius C D continued, is the Secant of 55<SUP>d</SUP>, and by Parallels drawn through the Tangents in the line Q C, will also be divided into a line of Tangents, wherefore through the Tangent of 32<SUP>d</SUP> 25′, draw a Parallel meeting with the Line or Secant of 55<SUP>d</SUP> drawn through the Quadrant at <HI>k,</HI> then is the extent Q <HI>k</HI> the Tangent to that Radius, which prick from AE to B, and draw L B, and it repre∣sents the great Arch between these places, and the Latitudes thereof from the Equinoctial are measured by the Parallel Me∣ridians, which are of several Radiusses, being Parallels drawn through the Tangents of 10<SUP>d</SUP>, 20<SUP>d</SUP>, 30<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="100" REF="85"/>
<P>Now to finde the Latitudes of the Arch from the <HI>Lizard</HI> for every 10<SUP>d</SUP> difference of Longitude.</P>
<P>In the first Parallel take the extent 1, 10, and place on the Se∣cant of 10<SUP>d</SUP> from Q to <HI>a,</HI> also take the extent 2, 20, and place on the Secant of 20<SUP>d</SUP> from Q to <HI>b;</HI> or if these extents be too long, the extent <HI>f</HI> 2 being prickt on the Secant of 20<SUP>d</SUP>, shall reach from the Arch of the Quadrant to <HI>b,</HI> as before.</P>
<P>Now if you take the nearest distances from the points <HI>a b c d e</HI> to the Equinoctial AE Q, and measure them in the Meridian-line Q L, they there shew you the latitudes of the Arch required: thus the latitudes of the Arch or the points

<P>To these former ways, I shall lastly add the Geometrical way, which is void of all Caution or Excursion, and carries on the Pro∣portions before delivered for Calculation.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<PB N="101" REF="85"/>
<P>Let the Example be the same as before, between the <HI>Lizard</HI> and <HI>Trinity Harbour.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Center V with the lesser Chord, describe a Circle, and draw A S and B I parallel, the sum of the Complements of both Latitudes is 96<SUP>d</SUP>, the Sine whereof is the Sine of 84<SUP>d</SUP> its Complement to a Semicircle, which prick from A to S, and the difference of those Complements is 14<SUP>d</SUP>, make B D the Sine thereof, a ruler over S and D cuts the Diameter at E.</P>
<P>Out of the lesser Chords prick 68<SUP>d</SUP> 30′, the difference of Lon∣gitude from B to H, a ruler over H and E cuts the Limbe at K, and the Arch B K is half the difference of the Vertical Angles, which prick from H to G and L, then if you divide the Semicircle B A into 90 equal parts, the Arch B G is the greater Vertical Angle, to wit, 53<SUP>d</SUP> 52′, and the Arch B L the lesser, to wit, 14<SUP>d</SUP> 38′. Now by help of this Scheme you may easily describe the great Arch in the former Quadrant, take the Extent B E from hence, being the Sine of the lesser Vertical Angle, which belongs to the greater Latitude, and upon A in the same Quadrant describe an Ark therewith at <HI>n,</HI> a ruler from the Center cuts the parallel of Latitude there at L, through which point the great Arch was drawn.</P>
<P>In the former Scheme, the Vertical Angles being the Angles at the Pole on each side the Perpendicular, are measured from the Point B, and the Chords of those Angles from the Point A, are the Cosines of those Angles; and so the extent A L is the Cosine of the lesser Vertical Angle, which prick from A in the line A S, the point found we may call <HI>the Vertical point;</HI> then prick down the Sines of every fifth degree from 90, as of 85<SUP>d</SUP> 80<SUP>d</SUP> &amp;c, in the line I B, from I towards B, and laying a ruler over the Vertical Point, and all those Sine Points divide the Diameter into as many points, then prick down the Sine of the Latitude, to wit, 50<SUP>d</SUP> in the Semicircle A B, from A upwards towards B, and a ruler over the said Latitude point, and all the former points found in the Diameter, will cut the under Semicircle B A in as many points or Arkes more, which being counted or measured from B downwards towards A, are the respective Latitudes of the great Arch sought.</P>
<P><HI>Nota,</HI> if a line of sines equal to the diameter be graduated on the floap edge of a ruler, the sines in the line B I may be easily pricked
<PB N="102" REF="86"/> down with the pen, by the edge thereof without Compasses, and the Arkes in the under Semicircle B A, may be readily measured by view, by laying the beginning of that line of Sines to the point B, and moving the edge of the ruler to each respective Ark before found in the said Semicircle.</P>
<P><HI>Here note,</HI> that a Semicircle being divided into 90 equal parts, the distances of each degree from one end of the Diameter, are Sines of those Arkes, the whole Diameter being their Radius, wherefore the use of Sines is as Geometrical as the use of Chords.</P>
<P>In the same Scheme the Reader may first finde the Perpendi∣cular, and then the Distances on each side of it, by Proportions before set down.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Now for the Latitudes of the great Ark.</HEAD>
<P>Having some of these ways found the Latitudes of the Arch, make a <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> for your Voyage, laying down the two places, suppose the <HI>Lizard</HI> at L in the following Chart, in the Latitude of 50 degrees, and <HI>Trinity Harbour</HI> at T in the Lati∣tude of 36 degrees, the difference of Longitude, to wit, L M, be∣ing 68 degrees and a half, then because the Perpendicular falls between both places, count off the lesser Vertical Angle 14 de∣grees 63 Centesms from L to P, and there raise the Perpendi∣cular P R.</P>
<P>This following Chart we have made as large as the page would admit, and having a Meridian-line fitted to the degrees of Lon∣gitude in that Chart, by the edge thereof on the Perpendicular P R, you may prick down the Latitudes of the Arch before found, and 5 degrees difference of Longitude on each side of the Perpen∣dicular at a time, and thereby graduate the respective Points or Crosses through which the curved prickt line is drawn.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>The Latitude of the Arch at 30<SUP>d</SUP> difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, is 46<SUP>d</SUP> 85 Centesmes, at which in the Meridian line P R is set the letter <HI>a;</HI> with the extent P <HI>a</HI> setting the Com∣passes at 30 in the line L M, describe a small cross at 9: Again, with the extent P 30, setting one foot at <HI>a,</HI> describe another cross or little Ark at 9: thus may all the rest be found, through all which
<FIGURE>
<PB N="103" REF="86"/>
</FIGURE>you may draw a curved line which shall run in the Chart near the great Arch; And now the work to be done, is to finde either by Calculation, or upon the Chart, all the respective Courses and distances from Point to Point, and to sayl as near the said Arch as you can.</P>
<P>Now to the apprehension the right Line L T will seem nearer then to sayl along by the prickt Arch, also it may seem improba∣ble that a Ship bound from the <HI>Lizard</HI> to <HI>Trinity Har∣bour</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> being a place nearer the Equino∣ctial by 14 degrees of La∣titude, should yet run into a more Northwardly Lati∣tude then the <HI>Lizard.</HI></P>
<P>To which I answer, That <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> being no Projection of the Sphere, doth not represent things to the fancy as they are in the Sphere, but as they are accommodated to that Chart, by which <HI>Trinity Harbor</HI> in that Chart bears from the <HI>Lizard</HI> 74<SUP>d</SUP> 17′ from the Meridian, which is above 6½ points to the Westwards of the South, to wit, West and by South ¼ of
<PB N="104" REF="87"/> a point, and one degree 39 minutes more Southwardly, and the Distance in the Rumbe is 1034 leagues, whereas the Distance in the Arch, if it could be precisely followed, is 1003 leagues, and following it from point to point, through every 5 degrees differ∣ence of Longitude from the Perpendicular, it is 1020 leagues al∣most, being less then the Distance in the Rumbe by 14 leagues, as appears by Calculation or the Chart it self.

<P><HI>Example:</HI></P>
<P>If a Ship sayl 1000 Leagues South South-west, against the second Point counted upward, we shall finde the difference of Latitude to be 46<SUP>d</SUP> 19 Centesmes, but counted downward we shall finde the Departure from the Meridian to be 19 degrees 13 Centesmes, which Numbers multiplyed by 60, cuting off five places towards the right hand, give the difference of Latitude and Departure in that Course for 60 leagues to be

<P>When some Courses increase the Latitude, and others decrease it, the difference between the North and South Column (found by substracting the lesser from the greater) gives the difference of Latitude, so likewise the difference of the East and West Columnes give the Departure, which in this Example is 4<SUP>d</SUP> 07, this difference of Latitude and Departure substracted out of the whole difference of Latitude and of Longitude between the said two Islands, there rest 4<SUP>d</SUP> 17 Centesmes difference of Latitude between the Ship and <HI>St. Nicholas Island,</HI> and 3<SUP>d</SUP>, 93 difference of Longitude, by
<PB N="109" REF="89"/> which the Course from the Ship to the said Island, will be found to be 43<SUP>d</SUP>, 28 Centesms to the West-wards of the South, and the distance 5<SUP>d</SUP>, 73 being about 114 leagues and a half, as shall after∣ward follow.</P>

<P><HI>To the Departure from the Meridian</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>And so is the Secant of the Rumbe: To the distance</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Example. <HI>For the Departure.</HI></P>
<P>Let the instance be the same as in page 24, where we suppose the Course to be 3 points from the Meridian, to wit, S W <HI>b</HI> S, and the corrected difference of Latitude to be 2 degrees 24 minutes, or 2 degrees 4 tenths, or 40 Centesms, by which multiplying 668, the Tangent belonging to 3 Points in the former Table, the result cutting off 5 figures, is 1<SUP>d</SUP> 60320, wherefore the Departure from the Meridian is 1 degree 6 tenths▪</P>
<P><HI>For the Distance.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner the Secant of three points, to wit, 1202 being multiplyed by the difference of Latitude 2<SUP>d</SUP>, 40, cuting off 5 figures is 2<SUP>d</SUP>, 88480, wherefore the distance is 2 degrees 88 Centesmes at 20 Leagues to a degree, is 50 leagues, and three quarters, or 50, 76.</P>
<P>For keeping a reckoning by Longitude (which is applyable to <HI>Mercators Chart</HI> and removes the error of the <HI>Plain Chart</HI>) the Table of Meridional parts were added at the end of the Book for working of this Proportion.</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Tangent of the Rumbe</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So are the Meridional parts between both Latitudes:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the difference of Longitude</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Which Proportion requires the difference of Latitude to be first found, and then by help of the Table of Meridional parts at the end of the Book, the difference of Longitude may be found, which Table being made but to every second Centesm, hath half the difference set down at the bottom of the Page, which added to the Meridional parts of any even Centesm above it, makes the Meridional parts for each odd Centesm, thus the Meridional parts
<PB N="110" REF="90"/> for 25<SUP>d</SUP> 22 is 26, 076, whereto adding 11, the sum being 26, 087 are Meridional parts for 25<SUP>d</SUP> 23 Centesms, in the first Example of the Traverse the difference of Latitude is 2<SUP>d</SUP> 77 Centesms.</P>

<P>Which being multiplied by the Tangent of the second Point, to wit, 414, cutting off 6 places (three by reason the Radius is 1000, and three more for the Decimal parts of the Meridional Number) the amount being 1<SUP>d</SUP>, 282986, shews that the differ∣ence of Longitude is 1 degree 28 Centesms, of which there may be a Column of East and West kept, like as was done for the De∣parture; and this casting up of the Longitude may be readily done also on the Logarithmical Ruler, or by Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> his late Tables for that purpose without Calculation, whereof we made mention in Page 37.</P>
<P>We have before said, that a Table of Sines is sufficient to sup∣ply all Calculation, though o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er Tables may be more ready for dispatch when they are at hand, as we have shewed concerning the Table of Meridional parts in Page 48.</P>
<P>Out of it the Secants are made by this Proportion:</P>

<P><HI>So is the Radius: To the Secant of the given Arch</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Which Proportion holds backwards to finde the Arch in the Table of Sines, if a Secant were given at adventure, and the Arch required.</P>
<P>Also out of it the Tangents are made by this Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine of an Arch: Is to the Sine of the said Arch</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius: To the Tangent of the Arch proposed</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Which Proportion doth not hold backwards to finde the Arch if a Tangent were given, in which Case the Secant may be found, and thereby the Arch, for the square of a Tangent more the square of the Radius, is equal to the square of the Secant. In this Case we have also the Propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of the Cosine to the Sine given (be∣ing the same with that of the Radius to the Tangent) and the sum o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their squares given (being equal to the square of the Radius) which very Case is reduced to a double equation in the 33<SUP>d</SUP> Que∣stion of Mr. <HI>Moores Algebraick Arithmetick,</HI> and by which the
<PB N="111" REF="90"/> Radius and a Tangent being given, either the Sine or Cosine may be found, without finding the Secant.</P>
<P>If such a Proportion as this were proposed:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Tangent of an Arch</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Tangent of another Arch:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Tangent of a fourth Arch</HI> ∷</P>
<P>It might be resolved thus, without making a Table of Tangents: Make the Product of the Radius, and of the Cosine of the second Ark the Divisor, and the product of the Sines of the second and third Ark, and of the Cosine of the third Ark the dividend, and the Quotient will be the Tangent of the fourth Ark sought.</P>
<P>In like maner, if all those tearms were Tangents, the Product of the Radius Sine and Cosine of the first Ark would be the Divisor.</P>
<P>And the Product of the Sines, and Cosines of the second and third Ark, the Dividend whereby might be found, the Quotient being the Tangent sought, and consequently the Arch answering thereto; after the like manner with due regard to the Proportion for making the Secants, any Secant might be supplyed, and a Pro∣portion wholly in Secants by turning those Arkes into their com∣plements, is changed wholly into sines, or two tearms being Secants are changed into Sines by altering the places or order of those tearms, and their Arkes into their complements.</P>

<HEAD>How to Calculate a Table of Natural Sines.</HEAD>
<P>How to make the Sine of any Arke at pleasure, <HI>Snellius</HI> in his <HI>Cyclometria</HI> hath shewed, without making many such Sines as are not required, in which he went beyond all fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer Writers, one way he hath holds true as far as 30<SUP>d</SUP> of the Quadrant, out of which Sines their Cosines may be made, and so the Quadrant filled from 60<SUP>d</SUP> to 90<SUP>d</SUP>, and then by finding the Sine of the double Ark it may be supplyed from 30<SUP>d</SUP> to 60<SUP>d</SUP>, but in regard the performance is very tedious, and therefore not to be prosecuted in the Con∣struction of a whole Table, we shall omit to mention it; another way he hath which doth not hold true to above 1/12 part of the Quadrant so that when a great Ark near the end of the Quadrant is given, he findes the Cosine thereof first, and thereby the Sine, or if the Ark be remote or about the middle of the Quadrant, he findes the Sine of the eighth or some such part of it, and then by finding the Sine of the double Ark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> backwards he findes the

<PB N="111" REF="91"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="112" REF="92"/> Sine sought; but how to Calculate a whole Table by Proportion with ease, is attained unto by our worthy Countrey-man Mr. <HI>Mi∣chael Darie,</HI> who discovered the same in the year 1651, and com∣municated unto me the Proportions for that purpose long since, whose method we shall now insist upon.</P>
<P N="1">1. The readiest way is to assume the Proportion of the Diame∣ter of a Circle to its Circumference to be known, and to be in the Proportion of 113 to 355 (of which see <HI>Maetius</HI> his <HI>Practical Geo∣metry</HI>) which two Numbers are easily remembred, being the three first odde figures of the Digits, each of them twice wrote down and cut asunder in the middle.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is most convenient that the Radius or whole Sine should be an Unit with Cyphers, and so the Proporrtion of the Diameter to the Circumference, found by the two Numbers above, is such as 2000000, to 6283185, so far true; and to finde it true to as many places of figures as you please, consult Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> his Wri∣tings, or <HI>Hungenius de Magnitudine Circuli.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Sine of one Minute or Centesm doth so insensibly differ from the length of the Arch to which it belongs, that the length of the Arch of one Minute or Centesm may be very well taken to be the Sine thereof, and in the largest Tables that ever were published, differs nothing therefrom, wherefore a Minute being the 21600 part of the Circumference of a whole Circle, the like part of the number 6283185 being 290, is the Sine of 1 Minute.</P>
<P N="4">4. You may finde the Cosine of one Minute by substracting the square of the Sine of one minute from the square of the Radius, the square root of the remainder is the Cosine of one minute.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Sine and Cosine of one Minute being thus given, all the rest of the Sines in the Quadrant may be calculated by Mr. <HI>Daries</HI> excellent <HI>Sinical Proportion,</HI> which runs thus:</P>
<P>If a rank of Arches be equi-different,</P>
<P><HI>As the Sine of any Arch in the said rank: Is to the sum of the Sines of any two Arks alike remote from it on each side</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of any other Arch in the said rank: To the sum of the Sines of the two Arches next it on each side, having the like com∣mon difference</HI> ∷</P>
<P>And in a Semicircle we may make the Radius the middlemost of the three Arches, and the two Arches on each side of it shall be
<PB REF="92"/> Arches one of them less by a Minute, and the other of them grea∣ter by a minute then a Quadrant, the same Sine being common to both Arches, by reason whereof it will follow from the former Proportion, that</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the double of the Cosine of one minute:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of one minute: To the Sine of two minutes and of</HI> 00 ∷</P>
<P><HI>And so is the Sine of</HI> 2 <HI>minutes: To the sum of the Sines of</HI> 3 <HI>mi∣nutes and of one minute</HI> ∷</P>
<P>From which sum taking the Sine of one minute, the remainder is the Sine of 3 minutes; And so also by the former Proportion,</P>
<P><HI>Is the Sine of</HI> 3 <HI>minutes: To the sum of the Sines of</HI> 2 <HI>minutes and</HI> 4 <HI>minutes</HI> ∷ and so on successively.</P>
<P>In which excellent Proportion, because the first tearm is the Radius, Division is shunned, and because the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cond tearm varies not, having multiplied it by all the 9 Digits, the whole Calcula∣tion will then be performed by Addition and Substraction; But if you will finde the Sines of Arks near the end of the Quadrant first, the same Proportion continues.</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the double of the Cosine of one minute</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Cosine of the said minute; To the sum of the Cosines of two minutes, and of</HI> 00, <HI>the Cosine whereof is the Radius:</HI></P>
<P><HI>And so is the Cosine of two minutes: To the sum of the Cosines of three minutes, and of one minute</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>And so is the Cosine of</HI> 3 <HI>minutes: To the sum of the Cosines of</HI> 4 <HI>mi∣nutes, and of</HI> 2 <HI>minutes,</HI> and so on successively.</P>
<P>Note also, that having made the Sines of the five first and last degrees, and their quarters, the intermediate Sines may well e∣nough in a Table not very large be supplied, by dividing the dif∣ferences proportionally, especially for the five first degrees of the Quadrant, in which the differences do but very little differ from each other: If besides the Sines of the five first and last degrees, and their Minutes or Centesms, there be moreover given in store the Sine of every tenth degree in the Quadrant, which may be found by the former Proportions (after the Sine of the fifth de∣gree is found) the Sine of any other Arch whatsoever without ma∣king any more Sines in a successive order, may by help of those in store be readily calculated, by reason no Arch in the Quadrant can be given, but it will be within five degrees or less of some known Sine, the Arch of that Sine we must make the middle
<PB N="114" REF="93"/> Arch, and the Sine and Cosine of the Arch of difference between the middle Arch, and the given Arch, is by supposition already in store, and it will hold:</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius: Is to the Cosine of the Arch of Difference</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of the mean or middle Arch: To the half sum of the Sines of the extream Arches on each side of it alike remote, where∣of the given Arch is one</HI> ∷</P>
<P>Again, <HI>As the Radius: Is to the Sine of the Ark of difference</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the Cosine of the middle Arch: To the half difference of the Sines of the said extream Arches</HI> ∷</P>
<P>The half sum of those Sines added to their half difference, makes the Sine of the greater of those extream Arches, and their difference makes the Sine of the lesser of those extream Arches, one of which is the Sine of the Arch sought.</P>
<P>Admit in this latter Proportion it were required to produce the fourth tearm so, as that it should be the whole difference of the Sines of the Extream Arches, then must half the Radius be the first tearm, being equal to the Sine of 30<SUP>d</SUP>, which is the Cosine of 60<SUP>d</SUP>, and therefore if we make the middle Arch 60<SUP>d</SUP>, by reason of the Proportion of equality in the two first tearms, it follows that the Sine of the Ark of Distance of either of the extreams from 60<SUP>d</SUP>, is equal to the difference of the Sines of those extream Arches, and consequently having all the Sines under 60<SUP>d</SUP> made, all the rest a∣bove it are made by Addition onely: for instance, the Sine of 10<SUP>d</SUP> is equal to the difference of the Sines of 50<SUP>d</SUP>, and of 70<SUP>d</SUP>, and therfore being added to the Sine of 50<SUP>d</SUP>, shal make the Sine of 70<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<P>So likewise in the former of those Proportions, if you would have the last tearm to be the sum of the Sines of the Extreams, half the Radius must be the first tearm, and then making the mean or middle Arch to be 30<SUP>d</SUP>, by reason of the Proportion of equali∣ty between the Sine thereof and of half the Radius, it follows that the Cosine of the Ark of Distance of either of the extreams from 30<SUP>d</SUP>, is equal to the sum of the Sines of those extream Arches, from which taking the lesser of those Sines, the remainder is the greater; hence it follows that if the Sines of the first and last 30<SUP>d</SUP> of the Quadrant be given, from them all the Sines between 30<SUP>d</SUP> and 60<SUP>d</SUP> may be made by substraction. Let the three Arks be 20<SUP>D</SUP>, 30<SUP>d</SUP>, 40<SUP>d</SUP>, the Sine of 80<SUP>d</SUP> being the Cosine of 10<SUP>d</SUP>, the distance of these Arks from the middlemost, is also equal to the sum of the
<PB N="115" REF="93"/> Sines of 20<SUP>d</SUP> and of 40<SUP>d</SUP>, from which sum Substracting the sine of 20<SUP>d</SUP> the remainder is the sine of 40<SUP>d</SUP>; or the Sines of the last 60<SUP>d</SUP> of the Quadrant being given, by the same reason the Sines of the first 30<SUP>d</SUP> may be found by Substraction, as in the present instance, if out of the sine of 80<SUP>d</SUP> you substract the sine of 40<SUP>d</SUP>, the remainder is the sine of 20<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<P>From the first Sinical Proportion, making the Radius the Sine of the middlemost of three equi-different Arks, it follows:</P>
<P><HI>That as the Radius: Is to the sum of the Sines of the two arches next it on each side</HI> ∷ Or rather by two other tearms in the same Pro∣portion, <HI>As half the Radius: Is to the sine of either of those arks</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is the sine of the said arch: To the sum of the Radius, and of the Sine of a fourth arch, having the same common difference</HI> ∷</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Consectary.</HEAD>
<P>Wherefore the Rectangle of half the Radius, and of the sum of the Radius, and of the sine of any other Arch, is equal to the square of the sine of the middle Arch, from thence it followes, that the sine of any Arch in the Quadrant being given, we may by this Rule, and extracting the square root, perpetually bisect or finde the sine of the middle Arch between it and 90<SUP>d</SUP>, and so run up very speedily towards the end of the Quadrant; of which sine so found, the Cosine may be found by another extraction, and then you have the sine of as small an Arch as you please, near the beginning of the Quadrant, from which by Proportion, in regard the length of the sine and of the Arch to which it doth belong, have no sensible difference, you may finde the sine of one minute or Centesme, and thence by the former Proportions raise a whole Table of Sines to as large a Radius as you please, albeit the Proportion of the Diameter to the Circumference were wholly unknown, which not∣withstanding hereby might be found, for having made a sine to a very small part of the Quadrant, the double thereof is the side of a Polygon inscribed, and by Proportion:</P>
<P><HI>As the Cosine so found: Is to its Sine ∷ So is the Radius: To the Tangent of the Arch to which the small Sine belongs</HI> ∷</P>
<P>The double of which Tangent is the side of the like Polygon cir∣cumscribed, the length of the Arch of the Circle contained be∣tween the sides of these two Polygons, being greater then the side of the inscribed Polygon, and lesser then the side of the circum∣scribed Polygon.</P>
<PB N="116" REF="94"/>
<P>In finding the Sine of any middle Arch by the former Consecta∣ry, to shun the trouble of multiplying, we may assume the Radius to be 2, with a competent number of Cyphers, then the Sine of 30<SUP>d</SUP>, because it is half the Radius, will be an Unit with as many Cyphers, then to finde the Sine of 60<SUP>d</SUP> to that Radius, to the Sine of 30<SUP>d</SUP>, prefix to the left hand the number 2, and annex the Cy∣phers in the Radius to the right hand, and the square root of the number so made, shall be the Sine required, and the like for fin∣ding the Sine of the middle Arch between the Radius and the Sine of any other Arch given, and retaining the Radius 2 with Cyphers, the difference between the Sine of any Arch given and the Radius, having the figures of the Radius annexed thereto, the square root of the number so composed, shall be the Cosine of the middle Arch; or we may deliver it as a Consectary from former Proportions:</P>
<P><HI>That the Rectangle of half the Radius, and of the difference between the Sine of any Arch given and the Radius, shall be equal to the square of the Cosine of the middle arch, to any Radius whatsoever.</HI></P>
<P>We forbear to suit Arithmetical Examples to the fore-going Proportions and Consectaries, supposing the Reader furnished with so much Arithmetick, as that he can extract the square root, and work the Golden Rule, or Rule of Three. See page 12 of the First Part.</P>

<HEAD>Of Books of Tables.</HEAD>
<P>Such Tables as have a degree divided into 100 parts or Cen∣tesms, are to be preferred before those that divide the degree but into 60 Parts, Minutes or Sexagesms, because they are more exact in calculation, and more speedy in finding the part proportional; and it were convenient for a Book of Tables to be so contrived, that the Natural Tables of Sines, Tangents, and Versed Sines to 90<SUP>d</SUP>, might stand against the Logarithmical Tables of Sines and Tangents in a portable Book, to be had by it self, to which might be added a Table of the Meridian-line to each, or every second Centesm, with Tables of the Suns Declination, Right Ascension, and of the Longitudes, Latitudes, Declinations, and Right Ascen∣sions of some of the principal fixed Stars, and of the Longitudes and Latitudes of places; but those that have the Logarithmical Tables of Numbers, Sines and Tangents without the Natural, may supply the want of them.</P>
<PB N="117" REF="94"/>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> 1. Let the Natural Sine of 38<SUP>d</SUP> be required, the Loga∣rithmical Sine of that Ark is 9, 789342, because we may make the Radius of the Natural Sines to be an Unit, and all the rest to be Decimal parts thereof, reject the first figure of the Logarithm or Characterisk, being 9, and seek the remaining figures of the Logarithmical Sine, to wit, 789342, amongst the Logarithms of absolute Numbers, and you will finde the absolute Number an∣swering thereto to be 61566 nearest, and that is the Natural Sine of 38 degrees required.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Table of the Meridian-line may be supplied by this Pro∣portion, raised out of Mr. <HI>Bonds</HI> Additions to Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> Works</P>
<P><HI>As</HI> 75795: <HI>Is to</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>60 ∷</ITEM>
<ITEM>100 ∷</ITEM>
</LIST> <HI>So is the difference of the Logarithmical Tangents of</HI> 45<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>and of an Ark compounded or made of</HI> 45<SUP>d</SUP>, <HI>and of half the given Ark:</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the Meridional parts belonging to the given Ark</HI> ∷</P>
<P>If you use the number 60, you will make such a Sexagesimal Table as Mr. <HI>Wrights</HI> or Mr. <HI>Norwoods,</HI> but if you use the number 100, then you will produce a Centesimal Table like Mr. <HI>Gunters,</HI> or that in Mr. <HI>Roes</HI> Tables, in which the Arks to which the Meri∣dional Tables are fitted, are degrees and every other minute, but the Tabular Numbers are degrees and decimals, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very good Table of that kinde, and much fuller then either Mr. <HI>Gunters</HI> or Mr. <HI>Norwoods;</HI> the Table at the end of this Book is of the same kinde, but fitted to every second Centesm of a degree, in stead of every second minute.</P>
<P>The ground of the former Proportion is, that the Logarithmical Tangents above 45<SUP>d</SUP>, accounting every half degree for a whole one, are in the same Ratio or Proportion with a Table of the Me∣ridian-line, whence also it follows for Instrumental use, that a Line of Logarithmical Tangents will supply the defect of the Me∣ridian-line.</P>
<P>The number above used, to wit, 75795, is not the difference between the Logarithmical Tangents of 45<SUP>d</SUP> and 45½<SUP>d</SUP>, though near it, being the difference of the Logarithmical Tangents of 45<SUP>d</SUP>, and of 45<SUP>d</SUP> and one Centesm more, multiplied by 50; and for to avoid the trouble of Division in working this Proportion, it were convenient either to have a Table of the said Number, multiplied by all the nine Digits, or rather to alter the Proportion so as an U∣nit
<PB N="118" REF="95"/> might be the first tearm, and then making such a Table for the second tearm, the said Proportion in a manner would be wrought wholly by Addition and Substraction.</P>
<P>What former Ages performed by Tables, this latter Age hath endeavoured in some respects to perform without them: <HI>Snellius</HI> in his <HI>Cyclometria,</HI> shews us how the Sides of a Plain right Angled Triangle being given, we may without Tables finde the Angles of that Triangle.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the right angled Plain Triangle C E A, with the Radius C A, describe a Semicircle, produce the Diameter, and therein make D R <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qual to the Radius, and draw R B passing through A till it meets with the Tangent I B at B; now that which <HI>Snellius</HI> asserts, is, That the Tangent cut off, to wit, I B, is somewhat shorter then the Arch I A, though near it in length, when the Arch is not a¦bove 1/12 part of a Quadrant; and this <HI>Hugenius</HI> demonstrates in his Book <HI>De Magnitudine Circuli,</HI> where he finds fault with <HI>Snellius</HI> his Demonstration thereof. Now the Proportion for finding an Angle raised from that Scheme, lyes thus:</P>
<P><HI>As R E the sum of the double of the Hipotenusal C A, and of the side C E: Is to E A the lesser side</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is R I the triple of the Radius or Hipotenusal</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>To I B the length of the Arch required ∷ propé verum.</HI></P>
<P>This Proportion finds the length of the Arch, making the Hi∣potenusal always Radius, whereas in Calculation we always retain such a Radius whereof the Circumference of the Circle is 360<SUP>d</SUP>: now the Diameter of such a Circle will be found by the numbers in <HI>page</HI> 112, in which the Proportion of the Circumference to the Dia∣meter is expressed to be 114, 5915, wherefore the Radius of such
<PB N="119" REF="95"/> a Circle is 57, 2957, and the triple thereof is 171, 8871, then retaining the two first tearms of the former Proportion, we may make this number the thi d tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, and by one single work finde the Angle; or rather taking the halfs of all four tearms, the Pro∣portion will hold:</P>
<P><HI>As the sum of the Hipotenusal and of half the greater Leg of a Plain right Angled Triangle: Is to the lesser Leg thereof</HI> ∷</P>
<P><HI>So is</HI> 86: <HI>To the Angle opposed to the lesser Leg:</HI></P>
<P>The half of 171, 8871 is 85, 9435, which because we have taken it to be 86, the Proportion if the Angle be less then 30<SUP>d</SUP>, finds the Angle to be about one Centesimal part of a degree too much, but if the Angle be above 35<SUP>d</SUP>, by reason the Scheme is not absolutely true, must have these additions made to the Angle found thereby, from 35<SUP>d</SUP> to 38<SUP>d</SUP> adde one Centesm, from 38 to 40<SUP>d</SUP> adde two Cen∣tesmes to it, and afterwards to 45<SUP>d</SUP>, for every degree it exceed; 40<SUP>d</SUP>, adde one Centesm more besides the former two Centesms, and thus we may always finde the lesser acute Angle, and conse∣quently the greater, being the Complement thereof within one Centesm of the truth, which is nearer then any Mechanick way.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> In the former Triangle let there be given the Sides
<LIST>
<ITEM>C E 4, 17,</ITEM>
<ITEM>A E 3, 93,</ITEM>
</LIST> by extracting the square root of the sum of the squares of these two Numbers, we shall finde the side C A to be 5, 73, to which adding the half of C E, the sum is 782 the Divi∣sor, then multiplying 393 the lesser Leg by 86, the Product is 33798, to which you may annex Ciphers at pleasure to finde the Decimal parts of a degree, and dividing by 782, you will finde the quotient to be 43<SUP>d</SUP>, 22 Centesmes, to which if you adde 5 Cen∣tesmes error, the Angle sought is 43<SUP>d</SUP> 27 Centesms.</P>
<P>Readily to finde what allowance must be made in respect of the Arch found, you may repair to a Table of Natural Sines, and take the two Legs of the right Angled Triangle to be the sine and cosine of any Arch, and by the last Proportion finde how near you can recover the Arch again, whereby you will find what allowance must be made.</P>
<P>The Example here used is that mentioned in page 16 and 109, so that hereby we finde a Course and Distance on the Plain Chart, without the help of Tables, and by the like reason the height of a Gnomon, and the length of its shadow being given, the Suns height may be got without Tables.</P>
<PB N="120" REF="96"/>
<P><HI>Hugenius</HI> not thinking this way of <HI>Snellius</HI> to be exact enough, propounds another of his own upon this consideration, that the Chord of an Arch being increased by one third part of the differ∣ence between the Sine and the Chord of the said Arch, shall be very near equal in length to the Arch it self, yea so near, that in an Arch of 45<SUP>d</SUP>, it shall not erre or fall short above 1/18000 part of a degree, and in an Arch of 30<SUP>d</SUP>, not above the 1/21600 part of a de∣gree, whereby the Sines may be examined, and an Angle found without Tables, as if the sides of the former Triangle be given, by taking C E out of C A there remains E I, the square where∣of added to the square of E A, the Sine is equal to the square of the line A I the Chord, whereby may be found the length of the Arch I A to the given Radius C A, and then by another Pro∣portion the measure of the said Arch to the Radius of such a Cir∣cle, whose Circumference is 360<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<P>In like manner, if the sides of an oblique Plain Triangle were given, the Angles thereof might be found, if you first reduce that oblique Triangle to two right angled Plain Triangles, which is performed in every Book of <HI>Trigonometry</HI> without Tables.</P>
<P>But for such Cases of Plain Triangles, in which but one Side with two Angles are given to finde the other Sides, in regard the Proportions for such Cases require Sines, and that we have not attained any ready way to make the Sine of any arch at command, forbearing to mention such ways as are both troublesom and un∣certain, we must suppose that the Reader is furnished with a Ta∣ble of Sines, which most Mariners have in their <HI>Sea-mans Ka∣lendar.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OF THE SCALE Used in this Book.</HEAD>
<P>THough this Treatise bears the name of <HI>the Mariners Plain Scale new Plain'd,</HI> yet the Scale intended thereby, is cut in the Frontis-piece of the first Book.</P>
<P>Nothing more is necessarily required in the perfor∣mances of this Book, then from the commonly known Division of a Circle into 360 equal parts, called Degrees, to prick down any number of Degrees less then 180<SUP>d</SUP>, and a quadrant divided into nine equal parts, and one of those parts for convenience below the Diamater into 10 Sub-divisions, called Degrees, may very well serve the turn, which the Readers ingenuity will furnish himself withal in any place, if he have but Compasses, yet for expedition a line of Sines is often made use of.</P>
<P>In the following Diagram, the equal Divisions of the Semicircle, are transferred into the line of Chords in the Diameter, by setting one foot of the Compasses in A, which is called the lesser Chord.</P>
<P>Those Chords being numbred by the half Arches, to which they belong, become a line of Sines of the same Radius with the Diameter of the Semicircle, and are called the greater Sines.</P>
<P>To that Radius there is fitted a Chord of 60 <SUP>d</SUP>, called the greater Chord, that the Reader might be supplyed with both, for the lesser Chord will not serve to prick off an Arch in a Circle of twice the Radius whereto it is fitted, unless the said Chord be dou∣bled in a right line before it be pircked into the Circumference.</P>
<P>The Sines to the Chord in the Diameter, are graduated on the Radius or line C B, by drawing lines thorough each degree of the quadrants AB, DB, and are called the lesser Sines.</P>
<P>There is also added a Scale of equal parts and Rumbes for other Protractions, but we use neither of them in this Book.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="104"/>
<P>The Schemes in the Book are fitted either to the lesser or greater Chord here described.</P>
<P>Every degree of a Line of Sines, or Chords, we suppose to be divided into 60 parts, which we call minutes, which in the following Operations are guessed at, for a small Instrument will not admit of so many Sub-divisions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Sphaerical Definitions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEfore we proceed to the Resolution of any particular questi∣ons, it will be necessary to premise the common Spherical Definitions, and to shew how the Analemma repesents them.</P>
<P>The word Sphere, though, as <HI>Herigonius</HI> sheweth, it be taken in a fourfold sense, yet I think it not necessary to define above two of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Therefore a Sphere may, according to <HI>Theodosius,</HI> be under∣stood to be a solid Superficies, or round Body, contained under one Surface, in the middle whereof there is a point whence all right lines drawn unto the Circumference, are equal, and is made by the turning round of half a Circle, till it end where it began.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="104"/>2. It is taken for a certain round Instrument consisting of divers Circles, whereby the motions of the Heavens, and the Scituation of the whole World, is most conveniently represented.</P>
<P>For the better explanation whereof, Astronomers do imagine, 10 Principal points, and 10 Circles to be in the hollow inside of the first moveable Sphere, which are commonly drawn upon any Globe or Sphere, besides divers other Circles which are not deli∣neated, but onely apprehended in the fancy.</P>
<P>The Points are the two Poles of the World, the two Poles of the Zodiack, the two Equinoctial points, the two Solstitial points, and the Zenith and Nadir.</P>
<P><HI>The Poles of the World</HI> are two points, which are Diametrically, or directly opposite to one another, about which the whole frame of Heaven moveth from the East into the West, whereof one is perpetually seen by us, and is called the Arctick, or North Pole.</P>
<P>The other being hid from us, and directly opposite to the former, is called the Antarctick, or South pole, a right line imagined to be drawn from the one Pole to the other, is called the Axis, or Axeltree of the World.</P>
<P><HI>The Axis</HI> differs from the Diameter, because that every right line drawn through the Center of the Sphere, and limited on each side of the Surface of the Sphere, is a Diameter; but not an Axis, unless the Sphere move round about it.</P>
<P><HI>The Poles of the Zodiack,</HI> are two points Diametrically oppo∣site, upon which the Heavens move from the West into the East, one of them is towards the North, distant from the Arctick or North Pole, 23 degrees 31 minutes; the other is towards the South, and is as much distant from the South Pole.</P>
<P><HI>A Degree</HI> is the 360<SUP>th</SUP> part of any whole Circle, and a Mi∣nute is the 60<SUP>th</SUP> part of a Degree, but of late some divide a De∣gree into 100 parts, which are called Centesmes, or Centesimal Minutes, in defining some of the Points we must refer to Circles afterwards to be defined.</P>
<P><HI>The Equinoctial Points</HI> are in the beginnings of <HI>Aries</HI> and <HI>Libra,</HI> to which when the Sun cometh, he makes the day and night of an equal length throughout the whole World, to wit, in the begin∣ning of <HI>Aries</HI> about the 11<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March,</HI> which is accounted the
<PB N="4" REF="105"/> beginning of the Spring, and in the beginning of <HI>Libra,</HI> about the 13 of <HI>September,</HI> which is the beginning of Autumn.</P>
<P><HI>The Point of the Summer Solstice,</HI> is in the beginning of <HI>Cancer,</HI> to which when the Sun cometh, as about the 12<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>June,</HI> is the beginning of Summer, and the longest day in the year.</P>
<P><HI>The Point of the Winter Solstice,</HI> is in the beginning of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> to which when the Sun cometh, as about the 11<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>December,</HI> is the shortest day in the year, and in the Astronomical account, the beginning of Winter.</P>
<P><HI>The Zenith,</HI> is an imaginary point in the Heavens, right over our heads 90<SUP>d</SUP> from the Horizon.</P>
<P><HI>The Nadir,</HI> is a point or prick in the Heavens under our feet, opposite to the <HI>Zenith.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Circles of the Sphere.</HEAD>
<P>The 10 Circles are the Horizon, the Meridian, the Equino∣ctial, the Zodiack, the Colure of the Equinoxes, the Colure of the Solstices, the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> and the two Polar Circles.</P>
<P>The first six are called great Circles, and the other four lesser Circles.</P>
<P>By the Center of a Circle, is meant a Point, or Prick in the middle of the Circle, from whence all Lines drawn to the Circum∣ference, are equal, and are known by the name of Radius resem∣bling the spoak of a Cart-wheel.</P>
<P>That is said to be a great Circle which hath the same Center as the Sphere, and divides it into two equal halfs, called Hemispheres, and that is called a lesser Circle, which hath a different Center from the Center of the Sphere, and divides the Sphere into two unequal Portions or Segments.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD><HI>1.</HI> Of the Horizon.</HEAD>
<P>The Horizon is distinguished by the names of Rational or Sen∣sible, the Rational Horizon is a great Circle every where equidi∣stant from the Zenith, and divides the upper Hemisphere from the lower, and by accident or chance, is distinguished by the names of a right Oblique and parallel Horizon.</P>
<P>A right Horizon is such a Horizon as passeth through each Pole
<PB N="5" REF="105"/> of the World, and cuts the Equinoctial at right Angles, whence the Inhabitants under the Equinoctial, are said to have a right Ho∣rizon, and a right Sphere.</P>
<P>An Oblique Horizon is such a one as cuts the Equinoctial ob∣liquely, or aslope.</P>
<P>A parallel Horizon is not such a one as cuts the Equinoctial, but is coincident, and is the same therewith, and such is the Hori∣zon under the Poles.</P>
<P>The sensible Horizon is a Circle dividing that part of the Hea∣vens which we see, from that part which see not, thence called Fi∣nitor.</P>
<P>From the Accidental Scituation of the Horizon, follows many consequences.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those that live in a right Horizon, that is under the Equi∣noctial, have their days and nights always of an equal length, to them all the Stars both rise and set, twice in a year the Sun pas∣seth through their Zenith, consequently they have two Summers and two Winters, to wit, Summers when the Sun passeth through their Zenith; and Winters when he is in or near the Tropicks.</P>
<P N="2">2. In any right or Oblique Sphere, the length of the day when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, is equal to the length of the night.</P>
<P N="3">3. In any Oblique Sphere, the nearer the Sun approacheth to the Visible Pole, the longer are the Days more then the Nights, some Stars always appear, others never appear, and the more re∣mote from the Equinoctial, the greater is the number of such Stars, and the more inequality is there between the Days and Nights.</P>
<P N="4">4. To those that live under the Polar Circles, their day once a year is 24 hours long, and their Night nothing.</P>
<P N="5">5. Under the Pole, one half of the Sphere doth always ap∣pear, and the other half not appear, and one half of the year is well nigh continually Day, and the other half continually Night, because the Equinoctial lies in the Horizon; 'Tis said well nigh, for by reason of the Suns Excentricity, the day under the North Pole, is longer then the Night, about eight days; and on the con∣trary under the South Pole, is shorter then the night as many days.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="6" REF="106"/>
<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> Of the Meridian.</HEAD>
<P>The Meridian is a great Circle, which passeth through the Poles of the World, the Zenith and Nadir, and the North and South points of the Horizon, and is so called, because that at all times and places when the Sun by his daily motion cometh unto that Circle twice every 24 hours, maketh the middle of the day and middle of the night; all places that lie under the same Meridian, bear North and South, but places that lie East and West from one another, have each of them a several Meridian.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD><HI>3.</HI> Of the Equinoctial.</HEAD>
<P>It is a great Circle imagined in the Heavens, dividing them in∣to two equal parts, or halfs, called the North and South Hemi∣sphere, lying just in the middle between the two Poles, being every where equi-distant from them, and is called the Equator, because when the Sun cometh unto it, which is twice in the year, at his en∣trance into <HI>Aries</HI> and <HI>Libra,</HI> the days and nights are of an equal length throughout the whole World.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD><HI>4.</HI> Of the Zodiack.</HEAD>
<P>The Zodiack, <HI>alias</HI> Signifer, is another great Circle that divides the Equinoctial into two equal parts, the Points of Intersection being called <HI>Aries</HI> and <HI>Libra,</HI> the one half of it doth decline into the North, the other half into the South, as much as the Poles thereof are distant from the Poles of the World, namely 23<SUP>d</SUP> 31′, and likewise passeth through the two Solstitial Points, it's ordinary Breadth or Latitude is 12 degrees, but late Writers make it 14 or 16<SUP>d</SUP> by reason of the wandrings of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>A Line, dividing the breadth thereof into two halfs, is called the Ecliptick Line, because the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon are al∣ways under that Line, it's Circumference is divided into 12 parts called the 12 Signs, whereof each containeth 30<SUP>d</SUP>.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="106"/>
<P><HI>The Names and Characters of the</HI> 12 <HI>Signs, are</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aries</HI><ABOVE>♈</ABOVE> <HI>Taurus</HI><ABOVE>♉</ABOVE> <HI>Gemini</HI><ABOVE>♊</ABOVE> <HI>Cancer</HI><ABOVE>♋</ABOVE> <HI>Leo</HI><ABOVE>♌</ABOVE> <HI>Virgo</HI><ABOVE>♍</ABOVE> <HI>Libra</HI><ABOVE>♎</ABOVE> <HI>Scorpius</HI><ABOVE>♏</ABOVE> <HI>Sagittarius</HI><ABOVE>♐</ABOVE> <HI>Capricornus</HI><ABOVE>♑</ABOVE> <HI>Aquarius</HI><ABOVE>♒</ABOVE> <HI>Pisces</HI><ABOVE>♓</ABOVE></P>
<P>The six former are the Northern, and the six latter the Sou∣thern Signs.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Colures.</HEAD>
<P>These are two great Circles, and are no other then two Meri∣dians passing through both the Poles of the World, crossing one another therein at right Angles, and divide the Equinoctial and the Zodiack into four equal parts, making thereby the four Sea∣sons of the year.</P>
<P>The Colure of the Equinoxes is so called, because it passeth through the Equinoctial points of <HI>Aries</HI> and <HI>Libra,</HI> shewing there∣by the beginning of the Spring and Autumn, when the days and nights are equal.</P>
<P>The other Colure passeth through the two Solstitial or Tropi∣cal Points of <HI>Cancer</HI> and <HI>Capricorn,</HI> shewing the beginning of the Summer and Winter, at which two times the days are longest and shortest.</P>
<P>The very beginning of <HI>Cancer</HI> where the Colure crosseth the Ecliptick line, is called the Point of the Summer Solstice, to which place when the Sun cometh, he can approach no nearer the Zenith, but returneth towards the Equinoctial again, the Arch of the Me∣ridian or Colure contained betwixt the Summer Solstice and the Equator, is called the greatest Declination of the Sun.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the four Lesser Circles.</HEAD>
<P>The Tropicks are two lesser Circles, parallel to the Equinoctial, limiting the Suns greatest Declination towards both the Poles; that towards the North Pole is called the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> be∣cause the Sun being in the very point of entrance into <HI>Cancer,</HI> which is the nearest he can approach unto the North Pole, is then
<PB N="8" REF="107"/> in the point of the Summer Solstice, and by his diurnal or daily motion, describes a parallel, from thence called the Tropick of <HI>Cancer.</HI></P>
<P>The Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> likewise limiteth the Suns greatest Declination Southward, and is a lesser Circle parallel to the Equinoctial, and hath that Denomination put upon it, because it passeth through the beginning of <HI>Capicorn,</HI> and hath the like re∣ference to the South Pole, as the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> hath to the North Pole.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the two Polar Circles.</HEAD>
<P>These are two lesser Circles, distant so much from the Poles of the World, as is the Suns greatest Declination from the Equi∣noctial; in these Polar Circles, are the Pole points of the Zodiack, which moving round the Poles of the World, describe by their motion the said two Circles; that about the North Pole, is cal∣led the Arctick Circle, and that about the South Pole, the Antar∣tick Circle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of other Circles imagined, but not described in a material Sphere or Globe.</HEAD>
<P>Such are the Azimuths, Almicanteraths, parallels of Latitude and Declination.</P>
<P>Azimuths are all great Circles bisecting the Sphere which meet together in the Zenith, and may be imagined to pass through every degree and minute of the Horizon at right Angles thereto, and serve to find the true coast of bearing of the Sun or Stars at at any time, in respect of the four chief Coasts of the Horizon, East, West, North, South. By some they are tearmed Vertical Circles, because they pass thorough the Zenith, but then they call the Azimuth of East, or West, the prime Vertical.</P>
<P>The Sun or any Star having Elevation or Depression above or below the Horizon, are then properly said to have Azimuth; But if they be in the Horizon, either Rising or Setting, the Arch of the Horizon, between the Center of the Sun or Star, and the true Points of East or West, is called Amplitude.</P>
<P><HI>Almicanteraths</HI> are Circles parallel to the Horizon, continued up even to the Zenith, and serve to measure the Altitude, or
<PB N="9" REF="107"/> height of the Sun, Moon, or Stars above the Horizon, which is no other then a portion or Arch of an Azimuth contained betwixt that Almicanter which passeth thorough the Center of the Sun or Star and the Horizon.</P>
<P><HI>Parallels of Declination are lesser Circles,</HI> all parallel to the Equi∣noctial, and may be imagined to pass through every degree, &amp; part of the Meridian, and are described upon the Poles of the World.</P>
<P>Those parallels which in respect of the Sun or Stars, are called parallels of declination in respect of the Scituation of the earth, are called parallels of Latitude.</P>
<P>The Latitude of a Town or Place, is measured by the Arch of the Meridian, between the Zenith of that place, and the Equinocti∣al, or which is equivalent thereto, by the Arch of the Meridian of the place between the Elevated Pole and the Horizon.</P>
<P>In like manner the Declination of the Sun or any Star, is mea∣sured by the Arch of the Meridian, between the Sun or Star, and the Equinoctial.</P>
<P><HI>Parallels of Latitude in the Heavens,</HI> are all lesser Circles de∣scribed upon the Poles of the Zodiack or Ecliptick, and serve to define the Latitude of a Star, which is the Arch of a Circle, con∣tained betwixt the Center of any Planet or Star, and the Ecliptick Line, making right Angles therewith, and counted either towards the North or South Poles of the Ecliptick; the Sun never pas∣sing from under the Ecliptick Line, is said to have no Latitude.</P>
<P><HI>Longitude</HI> in the Heavens, is measured by the Arch of the Ecli∣ptick, comprehended between the Point of <HI>Aries,</HI> and a suppo∣sed great Circle or Meridian of Longitude, passing through the Center of the Sun or Stars, and the two Poles of the Ecliptick, but counted according to the order or succession of the Signs.</P>
<P><HI>Longitude</HI> on the Earth, is measured by an Arch of the Equi∣noctial, contained between the primary or first Meridian of any place where Longitude is assigned to begin, and the Meridian of any other place, but counted Eastward from the said first place, according as the right ascension is counted in the Heavens.</P>
<P><HI>Right Ascension,</HI> is an Arch of the Equinoctial (counted from the beginning of <HI>Aries</HI>) which cometh to the Meridian with the Sun, Moon, or Stars, or any portion of the Ecliptick; this is so useful, that Tables thereof are made both for the Sun and Stars,
<PB N="10" REF="108"/> whereby is known the true time when they come to the Meridian, also by help of the Stars hour, the true time of the Night.</P>
<P><HI>Olique Ascension,</HI> is an Arch of the Equinoctial, between the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> and that part of the Equinoctial that riseth with the Center of a Star, or any portion of the Ecliptick, in an Oblique Sphaere.</P>
<P><HI>Ascensional Difference,</HI> is the Ark of difference between the right Ascension and the Oblique Ascension, and thereby is mea∣sured the time of the Sun or Stars rising before, or after six.</P>

<P N="8">8. The hour of the day from six to any Altitude, is represented in the said point of Intersection, but in the parallel of Declina∣tion here by G ⊙, and all these Arches thus represented in right Lines, are the Sines of those Arches to the Radius of the parallel in which they happen, being accounted from the midst of the said parallel.</P>
<P>Now how to measure the quantities of these respective Arches by a Line of Chords, and consequently thereby to resolve all the

<P>The former Arches thus represented in right Lines, many whereof fall in parallels or lesser Circles, when Calculation is used, are all represented by Arches of great Circles (namely such as bisect the Sphaere) and the former Scheme doth represent the Triangles commonly used in Calculation.</P>
<P>Thus the right angled Triangle C <HI>d y,</HI> right angled at <HI>d</HI> sup∣posing the Sun at <HI>y</HI> is made of</P>
<P>C <HI>y</HI> The Suns place or distance from the nearest Equinoctial point.</P>

<P>P W O the angle of Position, that is, of the Suns Meridian with the Horizon, and of the like parts or their complements is made the Triangle C <HI>m</HI> W.</P>
<P>In the right angled Triangle C K G, right angled at K, sup∣posing the Sun at G.</P>
<P>C G is his Declination.</P>
<P>G K his height at the hour of six.</P>
<P>C K the Suns Azimuth from the East or West, at the hour of six.</P>
<P>K C G the angle of the Poles Elevation.</P>

<P>C I his height, being East or West.</P>
<P><HI>k</HI> C I the Latitude.</P>
<P><HI>k</HI> I C the Angle of the Suns position.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="110"/>

<P>Thus we have shewed how the former Scheme represents the Sphaerical Triangles used in Calculation, whereby of the six parts in each Triangle, if any three are given, the rest may be found by Calculation from the Proportions, and that either by Multipli∣cation and Division, when the natural Tables of Sines and Tan∣gents are used, or by Addition and Substraction when the Loga∣rithmical are used, and what is performed by either of those sorts of Tables, we shall here perform by Scale and Compass, from which performances the like measure of exactness, is not attain∣able as from the Tables.</P>

<P>Here, according to the Hipothesis of <HI>Ticho,</HI> it is to be suggested that there is ascribed to the Sun a triple motion; First, A mo∣tion upon his own Center, whereby he finisheth one revolution in 26 days time.</P>
<P N="2">2. A dayly motion from the East into the West, whereby he causeth the day and Night.</P>
<P N="3">3. An opposite motion from the West into the East, called his <HI>annual motion,</HI> whereby he runs once round in a year through the whole Ecliptick, moving near a degree in a day, and thereby cau∣seth the several Seasons of the year: these two latter motions are fancied out unto us by a man turning a Grind-stone 365 times round, while a worm strugling against, and contrary to that mo∣tion, creeps once round the contrary way, but obliquely and aslope, that is, from the further side of the Grind-stone towards the hi∣thermost, and by this motion the Sun is supposed to describe the Ecliptick Line, and continually to insist in this course; the other Planets, except the Moon, moving round him, and following after him like Birds flying in the air, being subject to his motions, and divers of their own besides, many of which motions are removed by the <HI>Copernican</HI> supposition of the earths motion, which is a subject of much controversie among the learned, however be it either the one or the other, the Propositions hereafter resolved, vary not by reason thereof.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="113"/>
<P>And so the Sun being supposed not to vary from under the Ecliptick, in respect of Latitude, the Proposition or query in effect is, what Longitude he hath therein; which for the present pur∣pose need onely be known from the nearest Equinoctial point, now this may be found within a degree by a following verse newly framed for this purpose, which may serve for some ages, the old Latine Distich being now out of date and erronious.</P>

<P>By this Rule we shall finde that the Sun enters into the re∣spective Signs,

<P>Now knowing on what day of the Moneth, the Sun enters into any Sign, it will be easie afterwards to know in what degree of the said Sign he is in for any other day.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the number of the day of the given Moneth, exceed the number of that day in which the Sun enters into any Sign, substract the lesser number from the greater, and the remainder is the de∣gree of the Sign the Sun possesseth.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>On the 21 of <HI>April,</HI> I would finde the Suns place, by the verse it appears, the Sun enters into <HI>Taurus</HI> on the ninth of that Moneth, which taken from 21, there remains 12, shew∣ing that the Sun is in the twelfth degree of <HI>Taurus,</HI> the second Sign, that is, 42<SUP>d</SUP> from the next Equinoctial Point.</P>
<P N="2">2. But if the number of the day of the given Moneth, be less then the number of that day in which the Sun enters into the be∣ginning of any Sign, the Sun is not yet entred into the said Sign, but is still in the Sign belonging to the former Moneth, in this case substract the given day, from the day of his entrance into the next Sign, and again substract the remainder from 30, and the remainder shews his place in the Sign of the former Moneth.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be required to know the Suns place the fifth of <HI>August,</HI> on the 13<SUP>th</SUP> day of that Moneth the Sun enters into <HI>Virgo,</HI> 5 from 13 rests 8, and that taken from 30, there remains 22, shewing that the Sun is in the 22<SUP>th</SUP> degree of <HI>Leo,</HI> the fifth Sign, and con∣sequently his distance from the Equinoctial point <HI>Libra,</HI> is 38 de∣grees; Having compared the Suns place, found by the former verse with a new Table of the same in the <HI>Sea-mans Calendar,</HI> it doth not at any time differ a degree from the truth, and seldom half so much.</P>
<P>In the Propositions following, we shall assume the Suns Decli∣nation to be given, in regard there are tables thereof in almost every Mathematical Book.</P>

<P>Then out of the line of Sines in the Diameter, prick down the Sine of the Suns place, or distance from the next Equinoctal point, which for the 21 of <HI>April</HI> was 42<SUP>d</SUP>, and it reaches to <HI>y,</HI> the nearest distance from <HI>y</HI> to AE C, measured on the line of Sines in the Diameter, shews the Declination sought in this Example, 15 degrees and a half, to measure it without Sines, prick the said nearest distance from C to <HI>p,</HI> and draw the parallel <HI>p y f,</HI> and the Arch AE <HI>f</HI> is the measure thereof on the greater Chord.</P>

<P>In Autumn, or the third quarter, the Sun having the like De∣clination towards the depressed Pole, the right Ascension found by the Scheme, must have a Semicircle added thereto, and would in this Example be 219<SUP>d</SUP> 33′.</P>

<HEAD>A third Example, for finding the Azimuth.</HEAD>
<P>In the former Examples, it may be observed that the Azimuth is alwayes found in the parallels of Altitude, which towards the Zenith grow very small, and consequently this way of finding the Azimuth in Latitudes, between or near the Tropicks, and some∣times in our own Latitude, when the Sun hath much Altitude, will be very inconvenient; for remedying whereof let it be noted, that the Azimuth may be alwayes found in the parallel of Lati∣tude.</P>
<P><HI>Example:</HI> For the Latitude of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> 13<SUP>d</SUP>, ⊙ Declination 20<SUP>d</SUP> North, Altitude 52<SUP>d</SUP> 27′.</P>

<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the first Scheme, having drawn the Horizon S N, its Axis C Z, the parallel of Altitude B A 52<SUP>d</SUP> 27′, set off the Latitude from N to P 13<SUP>d</SUP>, and draw the Axis C P, prick off the comple∣ment of the Declination 70<SUP>d</SUP> from P to D, and E, and draw the parallel of Declination D E, then is F ⊙ the Sine of the Azimuth, from East or West Northwards F A being Radius, which being placed from C to G, and the Arch I described with F ⊙, a Ru∣ler from the Center touching it findes S L 16<SUP>d</SUP> the measure of the Azimuth in the Limbe, but thus to transfer from a less to a greater will breed much incertainty, and the parallels of Altitude near the Zenith decrease very much, for remedying this inconve∣nience, change the names Latitude and Altitude, and fit the Ana∣lemma thereto, for the bare changing of the names of the two containing sides of a Triangle, doth not alter the quantity of the angle comprehended:</P>
<P>Then will the new Latitude be 52<SUP>d</SUP> 27′,</P>
<P>And the new Altitude 13<SUP>d</SUP> 00.</P>
<P>I say, the Azimuth is the same as it is in the Latitude of 13<SUP>d</SUP> when the Altitude is 52<SUP>d</SUP> 27′. Also the hour from noon in the new Latitude, is equal to the angle of Position in the old Lati∣tude,
<PB N="39" REF="122"/> and the angle of Position in the new Latitude, is equal to the hour from noon in the old Latitude.</P>
<P>The old or first Scheme may very well serve if you set off 70<SUP>d</SUP> the complement of the Declination each way from A, the end of the parallel of Altitude, and then through the point P, draw the parallel of Altitude parallel to the Horizon.</P>
<P>But here we have drawn a second Scheme, where N P is 52<SUP>d</SUP> 27′, P D and P E 70<SUP>d</SUP>, thorough which points are drawn the pa∣rallel D E; Also S B and N A is 13<SUP>d</SUP>, thorough which is drawn the parallel B A, then is F ⊙ the Sine of the Suns Azimuth to the Northwards of the East, to the Radius F A which is placed from C to G, upon which with F ⊙, was the Arch I described, and the Azimuth S L found to be 16<SUP>d</SUP> as before.</P>
<P><HI>Nota,</HI> also in the first Scheme (or in both) that the Radius C G might have been doubled, and pricked upon N S produced, then also must the extent F ⊙ have been doubled, and the Arch I therewith described; also, the hour of the day might after the same manner be found in the parallel of Latitude which may be convenient for Stars that have much Declination in that Case, the Declination and Latitude must change Names.</P>
<P>And thus when three sides are given to finde an angle, we may find it in the Analemma, by calling the complements of those sides the Declination, the Latitude, and the Altitude, or Depression at pleasure.</P>
<P>Also when three Angles are given to finde a side, those Angles must be changed into sides, by taking the complement of the greatest Angle to a Semicircle, and writing it, and the other An∣gles down to their opposite sides in another Triangle, as in the Scheme following, wherein as the angles are changed into sides; so are the sides changed into angles, and then the Case will be the same as before.</P>

<P>I have before suggested, that the names of Declination and latitude might change places, the angle remaining the same, hence it follows that a Star that hath 51<SUP>d</SUP> 32′ of north declination in the latitude of 23<SUP>d</SUP> 31′, shall have the like altitudes on all hours, or horary distances from the Meridian, as the Sun having 23<SUP>d</SUP> 31′ of north declination, hath in the latitude of 51<SUP>d</SUP> 32′, whereof no Example is needful.</P>
<P>Now to apply what hath been said to the finding of the di∣stances of places in the arch of a great Circle, let it be noted that this Case of finding the Suns Altitudes on all hours, and that for finding of distances are both of them one and the same case of Sphaerical Triangles, namely, two sides with the Angle compre∣hended given, to finde the third side, in the following Tri∣angle B L P.</P>

<P>In every Scheme of the Analemma, observe that the near∣est distance of the point of the Suns place in his pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allel of Altitude from the Equinoctial Line, is equal to the Sine of his Declination, from whence the resolution of this Proposition easily follows.</P>
<P>Having with 60 degrees of the Chords upon the Center C, drawn the Semicircle S Z N, the Diameter S C N, the Axis of the Horizon Z C, out of the Chords prick off the given Altitude from S to A, and from N to B, and draw the parallel thereof A F D B, then ptoportion out the Sine of 20 degrees to the Radius A D, draw the line A C, and therein from the Sines prick off 20 degrees from C to 20 degrees, and take the nearest distance to C D, and set that extent from D to the point F, then take 23 degrees 31 minutes from the Sines, and setting one foot in F, with the other draw the arch L, a right Line drawn from C, just touching the outward extreamity of that arch, as doth AE C, shall be the Equinoctial, and so the arch S AE is the complement of the Latitude, and Z AE the Latitude sought, in this Case 51<SUP>d</SUP> 32′.</P>
<P>By this Case of Triangles, the Declination and Latitude be∣ing given, the Suns Altitudes (or Depressions) to each assigned Azimuth may be found</P>
<P>This case may be done without the drawing of any Ellipsis, and that divers wayes, though it hath not hitherto been so repu∣ted; in order whereto observe that any two containing sides of a Triangle, may change names, as in the former Example: if the Latitude be 44<SUP>d</SUP> 39′, the Altitude to that Azimuth will be 38<SUP>d</SUP> 28′, consequently by the same Scheme and manner of work, if the Azimuths be prickt off in the parallel of Latitude, the respective Altitudes thereto may be found; but this Scheme I have further insisted upon in the first Part.</P>

<P>And let it be required to finde the Suns respective Altitudes to the Azimuths of 20<SUP>d</SUP> and 60<SUP>d</SUP>, on each side from the Vertical Circle. Upon the Center C, describe an arch bigger then a Se∣micircle, and draw the Horizontal Line S C N, and its Axis Z C at right angles thereto, and set off the Latitudes from S to A, and draw the parallel thereof L A, set off the Declination likewise from N to E, and draw the parallel thereof D E, which is easily done by pricking off the like arch above S.</P>
<P>Now to proportion out the Sines to the Radius A L, draw the Line A C, and there prick down the Sines of 20<SUP>d</SUP> and 60<SUP>d</SUP>, and take the nearest distances therefrom to the line C Z, and transfer or place those respective extents into the parallel of Latitude L A, pricking them down from L, then one foot of the Compasses resting in C, take the distance to 20<SUP>d</SUP> and 60<SUP>d</SUP> in the parallel of Latitude L A, and transfer or place them into the parallel of Declination D E, and there number them, as before, then take the distance between the Zenith at Z, and 20<SUP>d</SUP> in the parrallel of Latitude L A, and the said extent shall reach from 20<SUP>d</SUP> in the parallel of Declination D E, to F upward, and to H downwards.</P>
<P>The arch N F being 44<SUP>d</SUP> 39′, is the Suns height for 20<SUP>d</SUP> of Azi∣muth to the southwards of the East or West, and the arch N H 14<SUP>d</SUP> 15′, is the Suns height for the like Azimuth to the northwards of the East or West.</P>

<P>The ground of the former Scheme, is, that the Sun in his pa∣rallel of Altitude hath the like distance from the Zenith, as in his parallel of Declination, also his distance from the Center in his parallel of Altitude, is the same with his distance from the Cen∣ter in his parallel of Declination, whence follows another Deli∣neation of the Analemma suitable to this case, for we may place the parallel of Declination parallel to the Horizon, which now must represent the Equinoctial, then if the Sine of the Azimuth be prickt down in any given parallel of Altitude, the distance of that point from the Center and Zenith are both given, then ma∣king the Sun to have the like distance in his parallel of Declina∣tion from the Center, as he had in his parallel of Latitude: and moreover, if from the said point his distance from the Zenith in his parallel of Altitude be applied upward, it wil give the Latitude or Zenith sought, from the Horizontal line representing the Equi∣noctial, and by the bare change of names, if the Sines of the respe∣ctive Azimuths be prickt down in the parallel of Latitude, the respective Zeniths will become the Altitudes sought. See page 38 to this purpose. And the same Zenith distance and Center di∣stance, is common to Azimuths as much remote on the other side the Vertical, wherefore the Scheme findes both.</P>

<P>The arch S F being 80<SUP>d</SUP> 50′, is the greater Altitude that the Star shall have upon that Azimuth, and N H 45<SUP>d</SUP> 3′ is the lesser Altitude: and here observe, that such Stars as have more decli∣nation then the complement of the Latitude, never rise nor set; if their declination be also more then the latitude of the place, they will have two altitudes or heights on every Azimuth from the Meridian, except the remotest.

<P>To these ways I shall adde one more, purposely invented by my loving Friend Mr. <HI>Thomas Harvie,</HI> to shun the drawing of an Ellipsis, occasioned by a Question sent out of <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Jean Montfert,</HI> proposed to all the English Mathematicians, which the said Mr. <HI>Harvie</HI> speedily resolved, and hath since published his Resolution in Latine in a single Sheet, sold by <HI>Henry Sutton</HI> Mathematical Instrument-maker in <HI>Thread-needle</HI> street behinde
<PB N="51" REF="128"/> the <HI>Exchange,</HI> from which the Reader may be furnished with the Demonstration of what follows, the Geometrical performance ensuing being the same with that in the Authors Sheet, from whence, and by conference with the Author, I attained it.</P>

<P>Azimuth 30<SUP>d</SUP> from the Vertical, that is, from the east or west Required the Suns Altitudes to that Azimuth on each side the Vertical.</P>
<P>Having described a Circle S Z N, and drawn the Horizon S C N, the Axis or Vertical Z C B, prick off the Poles height or latitude from N to P, and from P set off 66<SUP>d</SUP> 29′, the Suns Polar distance being the complement of the Declination to D and E, and draw the Parallel D E. Prick down the Sine of the given Azimuth 30<SUP>d</SUP> out of the Sines from C to G, and from G draw B G parallel to D E, and joyn S B produced or continued, then thorough the Point F, draw the Line H A parallel to S B, then is the arch S A 49<SUP>d</SUP> 56′, the Suns Altitude for the Azimuth of 60<SUP>d</SUP> from the South, and the arch N H being 6<SUP>d</SUP> 36′, is the
<PB N="52" REF="129"/> Suns height for the Azimuth of 60<SUP>d</SUP> from the North. If H had fallen below N, then had the arch H N been the ark of the Suns depression under the Horizon, proper to the Azimuth given from the East or West northwards.</P>
<P>It had also been the Suns height for the like Declination to∣wards the south Pole, proper to the like Azimuth counted from the East or West southwards, so that there needs no Scheme for South Declinations.</P>
<P><HI>Nota,</HI> The excellency of this way further appears in this, that if the Azimuth we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e required, and the Latitude, Declination and Height given, the very contrary work would finde G C the Sine of the Azimuth to the common Radius.</P>
<P>The same manner of Operation also holds for the Sun or Stars when their Declination is more then the Latitude, in which case the Parallel of Declination will not cross the line C Z within the Circle, but must be produced to cut the line C Z continued without the Circle above Z, and then a line from the Intersection F happening without, being drawn parallel to S B, will pass through the quadrant Z N in two points, which shall be the two Altitudes required, when it so happens. And here note, that if C G had been pricked towards N, then B would have fallen as much above C, as it doth in the former Example below it, from which point B a line must be drawn to N in stead of S, which will be parallel to S B; and therefore a line drawn parallel thereto passing through F, shall as well give the Altitudes required, as it did before; wherefore when the distance between A and F is but small, though the point F happen within, yet the operation will be most certain to place C G on the other side the Vertical.</P>
<P>But here we must prevent an inconvenience, for in small La∣titudes when the Declination towards the elevated Pole is more then the Latitude, the parallel of Declination will not meet with the Vertical or Axis of the Horizon, but at a remote or inconve∣nient distance. I shall onely mention how this Inconvenience may be shunned, omitting an Example thereof, in regard other ways before spoke to may prove more convenient.</P>

<P>Through the points B I, draw the line D E, and it shall be the Parallel of Declination.</P>
<P>Divide the ark D E into halfs at P, and the arch P N is the Latitude 51<SUP>d</SUP> 32′.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="136"/>
<P>Place Z P from S to AE, and the arch AE D is the Declina∣tion 23<SUP>d</SUP> 31′. Moreover, the Amplitude, Hour, &amp;c. are given by the Scheme, though not required.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To Calculate the Latitude from the said Scheme.</HEAD>
<P>From the point I draw I L parallel to H F, and produce B F to L, then is I L equal to H F, the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes, and B L is equal to the Sum of B F and H I, and the angle B I L is equal to the Latitude of the place the first work is to finde B F and H I in the Parallels of Altitude: The Proportion will be,</P>
<P><HI>As the Radius is to the Cosine of the given Altitude (being the Ra∣dius of the Parallel)</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of the Azimuth from East or West belonging to the said Altitude, to the Sine of the said Azimuth in its pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allel of Altitude, whereby at two Operations may be found B F and H I.</HI></P>
<P>When the Azimuths are on different sides the Vertical, take the Sum, when on the same side the difference between the fourth tearms found by each Operation, then it holds:</P>
<P><HI>As the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the aforesaid Sum or difference:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Radius to the Tangent of the Latitude.</HI></P>
<P>The two first tearms of this latter Proportion in this Scheme, are as I L to L B.</P>
<P>Or it may be expressed in two Proportions, thus:</P>
<P><HI>As the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Cosine of the greater Altitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of the Azimuth (from the East) thereto belonging, to a fourth number.</HI></P>
<P>Again:</P>
<P><HI>As the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is to the Cosine of the lesser Altitude:</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Sine of the Azimuth thereto belonging, to a seventh number.</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of the fourth and seventh Numbers, when the Azi∣muths fall on different sides the Vertical; but their difference
<PB N="67" REF="136"/> when they happen on the same side, is equal to the Tangent of the Latitude.</P>
<P>Or it may be thus delivered:</P>
<P>Multiply the Cosine of each Altitude by the Sine of the Azi∣muth thereto belonging, and there will arise two Products, the sum of these Products when the Azimuths happen on different sides, but the difference of them when they happen on the same side the Vertical, divide by the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes, and the Quotient will be the Tangent of the Latitude sought. This supposeth the Operations to be per∣formed by the natural Tables of Sines and Tangents.</P>
<P>Now having the Latitude, either of the Altitudes with the Azi∣muth theteto belonging, we have two Sides and the Angle com∣prehended given, to finde the third Side, whereby is found the Declination required.</P>
<P>How from three Shadows happening the same day on a Hori∣zontal Plain, to Calculate the Latitude, &amp;c. as also to perform it by Scale and Compass, with another way for finding the Azi∣muth, I have shewed in a Treatise of <HI>Geometricall Dyalling,</HI> whereto the Reader is referred.</P>

<HEAD>SPHERICAL TRIANGLES Solved by PROJECTION.</HEAD>
<P>A Sphaerical Triangle is supposed to be described on the Surface or Convexity of the Sphaere.</P>
<P>The sides of a Sphaerical Triangle, are the Arches of three great Circles of the Sphaere mutually intersecting each other.</P>
<P>Those are said to be great Circles which bisect or divide the Sphaere in halfs.</P>
<P>A Sphaerical Angle (being the arch of Inclination between two Circles of the Sphaere) is measured by the arch of a great Circle described on the Angular point, as a Center between the sides, being extended to Quadrants.</P>
<P>Every Sphaerical Triangle is composed of three sides, and three angles opposed thereto, any three of which six parts being given, the rest may be discovered by Projection, and is the subject of the following Discourse.</P>
<P>The Pole of a Circle is a point in the Surface of the Sphaere, distant always 90<SUP>d</SUP> from the Circumference of that Circle to which it belongs, from whence it follows that all right lines pro∣duced to the Circumference of the said Circle, are equal.</P>
<P>Any two Lines so drawn, contain an Angle between them, measured by the Arch or Circumference to which they belong. By help of this Pole point, the sides of Sphaerical Triangles in all the following Propositions are measured.</P>
<P>A Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection of the Sphaere, is the Representation of the Cir∣cles of the Sphaere on some Plain or Flat, as they appear to the eye, according to its supposed situation.</P>
<P>By helps of such Representations of the Sphaere on a Plain, the
<PB N="2" REF="140"/> same Conclusions are performed on a Flat, as upon the Sphaere or Globe it self.</P>
<P>A Sphaerical Triangle is either right angled, or oblique angled; a right angled Sphaerical Triangle hath one right angle at the least, the measure of a right Angle being always a quadrant or 90<SUP>d</SUP>, the Sides about or including the right Angle, are called <HI>Sides</HI> or <HI>Legs;</HI> and the Side subtending the same, is called the <HI>Hipotenusal.</HI></P>
<P>Because these Triangles are more easily resolved then the ob∣lique, we shall first handle the sixteen Cases thereof, and then proceed to the twelve remaining Cases of oblique angled Sphae∣rical Triangles.</P>

<PB N="3" REF="140"/> prick 46<SUP>d</SUP> 43′ the given Leg, from Z to E, and from B to L, and draw the Diameter E V I.</P>
<P>Prick 42<SUP>d</SUP> the given Angle, from N to G, and from G to H, a Ruler from Z on H, cuts the Diameter at C, the Center of a Cir∣cle to be described with the extent C Z, to wit, the Circle Z A N.</P>
<P><HI>Nota,</HI> when the point H falls in the upper quadrant Z B, the Diameter S B must be extended, and the point C will happen to be found therein without the Circle; and a remedy for the find∣ing it with more certainty then this way affords, shall afterwards be prescribed.</P>
<P>If S F be made equal to N G, a Ruler from Z on F, findes the point A in the Diameter through which the Circle was drawn, which may be found in many Cases, not for necessity, but for more certainty: this Circle, in regard we project upon rhe plain of the Meridian, is an Azimuth Circle.</P>
<P>A Ruler from Z on G, findes the point P in the Diameter, be∣ing the Pole point of the Circle Z A N, a point that must of ne∣cessity be found, without which an Arch assigned in the said in∣ward Circle cannot be measured in the Limbe, nor can an Arch given in the Limbe be transferred into the said Circle.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>3. The other oblique angle.</HEAD>
<P>A ruler laid from ⊙ on P, cuts the Limbe at R, and the arch L R being 62<SUP>d</SUP> 41′, is the measure of the angle Z ⊙ E</P>
<P>Otherwise to measure this angle.</P>
<P>Set off a quadrant from D to M, or which is all one, make N M equal to S D, a Ruler from P on M, cuts the Azimuth Circle at Q, then a Ruler from ⊙ on Q, cuts the Limbe at T, and the arch I T being 62<SUP>d</SUP> 41′, is the measure of the angle I ⊙ N, which be∣ing the opposite angle to Z ⊙ E, is equall thereto, the comple∣ment whereof to a Semicircle, is the angle Z ⊙ V.</P>
<P>Any right angled Sphaerical Triangle, having the Sides thereof
<PB N="4" REF="141"/> continued to quadrants, there will arise out of it five other Tri∣angles, all made of the same parts or their complements of the first Triangle; wherefore any Case propounded, may be varied and variously projected within the primitive or fundamental Cir∣cle, as also without it, but in the following Cases we shall keep where we began.</P>
<P>To illustrate this, extend V E, and through the three Points O P L, describe a Circle, the Center whereof happens in the extended Diameter I X, to finde it upon the Points P L with any extent, make a cross with two arks near C, also the like with any other extent near Y, a ruler laid through these Intersections or Crosses, cuts the extended Diameter at X, upon which, as a Cen∣ter, describe the ark W L P O, the pole of which ark is the point ⊙, and if K Y be made equal to K O, a ruler from L on Y, findes the Center X as before, the six several Triangles thus arise:</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="1">1. The Triangle Z E ⊙ right angled at E.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Triangle Z W L right angled at W, whereto is equal the opposite Triangle N Q O.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Triangle ⊙ A V right angled at A.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="5" REF="141"/>4. The opposite Triangle thereto V W P, right angled at W.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Triangle P B L right angled at B.</P>
<P>This second Scheme is to shew how all these Triangles arise out of the Triangle first proposed: the arch N B divided into 9 equal parts, being 10 degrees each, with the ten small divisions or degrees beyond it, above B is all the Scale required or used in this part of the <HI>Treatise,</HI> from whence any ark required may be taken, or any ark given may be measured.</P>
<P>There are also included in the said Scheme as many quadran∣tal Triangles, the quadrantal Sides being prickt lines, the sides of each of which quadrantal Triangles are limited by the Pole points of that right angled Triangle from which it doth arise.</P>
<P>In the quadrantal Triangle V L P, the points V, L, P, are the three Pole points to the three sides of the right angled Triangle E Z ⊙, and the sides of this quadrantal Triangle, are equal to the angles of that right angled Triangle; Also the angles of this quadrantal Triangle, are equal to the Sides of that right angled Triangle, onely the right Angle and the Hipotenusal, being the greatest Side opposed thereto, are changed into their comple∣ments to a Semicircle.</P>
<P>The like also holds, if any other Angle and its opposite Side were changed into their complements to a Semicircle.</P>
<P>If the Side E Z and its opposite Angle E ⊙ Z, were so chan∣ged, and the other parts of that Triangle not altered, then would the Sides of the quadrantal Triangle O V P, be equal to the Angles of the right angled Triangle Z E ⊙, and the Angles of the said quadrantal Triangle, equal to the Sides of the right an∣gled Triangle, and the like holds in the other quadrantal Tri∣angles.</P>
<P>The quadrantal Triangle O P V, ariseth from the right angled Triangles Z W L, or O Q N.</P>
<P>So also do the qua∣drantal Triangles

<P>From the consideration whereof, may follow much variety in the projecting of any Case proposed.</P>
<P>Note in the first Scheme, that the arch N G being 42<SUP>d</SUP>, the ex∣tent V P is the Semitangent of that ark, that is to say, it is the
<PB N="6" REF="142"/> tangent of 21<SUP>d</SUP>, and the arch N H being 84<SUP>d</SUP>, to wit, the double of N G, the extent V C is the tangent of 42<SUP>d</SUP>, and the extent Z C the Secant thereof, the extent Z V being Radius, and to take out thus the tangent or secant of any ark, because the Cen∣ter happens in the circumference of the Circle, the ark it self must be doubled, or twice pricked down in the circumference; and after this maner may we take out the Semitangent, Tangent or Secant of any ark needful for the drawing of this Projection; which how to do by Scales of Tangents and Secants on a small Ruler, is handled in a Treatise, Entituled, <HI>Posthuma Fosteri.</HI></P>

<P>Place the said Extent from N to L, then a ruler laid over it and O, cuts the Meridian at P, which is the projected pole Point, through which point and the points H, I, G, if there be arks of great Circles drawn, the angles that the said arks make with the line S P, shall be the measure of the respective hours from Noon proper to each shadow: How to draw such arks, I have explained in a Treatise of <HI>Geometrical Dyalling,</HI> page 49. — See also <HI>Clavius de Astrolabio, Liber secundus, Prop.</HI> 13. who handles it largely.</P>
<P>This manner of finding the Hours I confess is troublesom, and may be sooner resolved by the Analemma: now we have the La∣titude, Declination, and all the Altitudes given.</P>
<P>In northwardly Regions where the Sun for some competent sea∣son doth not rise nor set, he hath no amplitude in that case, the Circle to be drawn through the three points, will fall altogether within the outward Circle, and may very well be described, and it will cut the Meridian S N in two points, the one towards the South, the other towards the North, a ruler from the East point O over each of the former points, will give the Suns south and north Meridian Altitudes in the Limbe; And if the ark between these Meridian Altitudes be divided into halfs, the point in the middle so found, is the Latitude point L, the ark between which and N, shews the Latitude required; after the same manner might the point L be found in all other Cases, which notwithstanding to avoid the drawing of a whole vast Circle we shunned, though when the Sun is near the Winter Tropick, the drawing of part thereof cannot be shunned, without the help of a Steel-bowe or some such like remedy, whereby to describe part of a Circle tho∣row three points given, which is the great and onely inconvenience of the Stereographick Projection.</P>
<P><HI>Clavius</HI> handles this Proposition after another manner, but not so convenient, and makes no further use of it.</P>
<P>But here we shall also apply it to the making of all Dyals that have Centers, except the Equinoctial. In a Treatise of <HI>Geometri∣cal Dyalling</HI> from page 72 to 82, I have shewed a general method both by Calculation, and with Scale and Compasses, how from three shadows to make all Dyals with Centers, from whence those that have leisure, may calculate the Arks found in the former
<PB N="29" REF="153"/> Scheme, whereto I now further adde, that the former Proposition here insisted on performeth the same; the three shadows C D, C E, and C F here, are the same in length with those there, and make the same angles at the Center here, as those did at the foot of the perpendicular Stile there; and supposing the former Plain to be a Declining Leaning Plain in some other Latitude, the Line S C N is the Substilar Line, and the Arch Z AE is the Stiles height, the same as we found it in that Treatise: Suppose this be a Plain that looks southward, not much leaning from the Zenith, if the former shadows happened in the Summer half year in north Declinations, the Scheme will describe a Winter parallel of as much south declination; also if the Sun had south declination, the Scheme would describe a parallel of as much north declina∣tion; but this is onely true when the elevated Pole is elevated above the northern or other face of the Plain, to illustrate this.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the Scheme above let S C N represent the Horizon of a certain place, the Latitude whereof is Z AE, or N L, the Equa∣tor is represented by AE Q, and D E represents a parallel of
<PB N="30" REF="154"/> North Declination, let Z C represent a Vertical or upright South Plain in that Latitude, but if the said Vertical Plain be∣come an Horizontal Plain, the height of the North Pole will be Z L, and the height of the South Pole H K, I say then, in respect of the first Horizon, the Sun being in the parallel of North Declination between D and A, his Altitudes on any hour from Noon (being the Angles between the Wall and the Sun) above the Vertical Plain Z A in the first Horizon, are in respect of the second Horizon, if the North Pole be elevated, his de∣pressions under the same upon the like hour from midnight, which are equal to his Winter Altitudes above the second Horizon Z C H, the Sun having as much South Declination being between B and G in the parallel F G; or, which is all one, retaining the Suns Declination the same, they are his Winter Altitudes upon the like hour from Noon, when the South Pole K is elevated above the Horizon H C Z, which is the reason why the Scheme describes a parallel of South Declination, when his Declination was as much North.</P>

<PB N="32" REF="155"/> which here we found by entring one foot of that extent in that ark, so that the other turned about, would but just touch V R: Having discovered the point B, through it draw B O parallel to E C, then take the nearest distance from C to R V, and place it in the Line O B from P, on that side thereof which is farthest from R V, here we placed it from P to M, then from the Center draw a line passing through the point M, as doth V X, and it shall be the Meridian Line required.</P>
