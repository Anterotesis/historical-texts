<P>I Am sorry I have so sad a subject as to occasion this, some time since, having been at Sea, and ab∣sent from this Port, some few dayes, in my absence the Councell of Warre exhibited Articles against Sir <HI>William Fenton,</HI> Knight and Colonell, Colonel <HI>Edm. Temple,</HI> Lieutenant Collonell <HI>Faire,</HI> and Major <HI>Doc∣dum,</HI> which Gentlemen they have committed close prisoners, to foure severall Garrisons, not permitting any to have correspondence with them; upon my re∣turne into Harbour here, where I presently understood of these sad divisions, I immediately wrote to the Councell of warre (my Lord being abroad in the field) that they would grant the imprisoned the liber∣ty of Subjects for me to send to them to see what they had to be transmitted to <HI>England,</HI> which from them I could not obtain, which gave me cause of much suspition of their actions, and occasioned my present dispatch of a Letter to be posted to my Lord, to know whether things were acted by his pleasure, and that
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>his Honour would declare his intention, in regard I heard a rumour he would make a Cessation with the Irish, which I protested against, and that if he did, I would block up all his Harbours, my Letter obtain∣ing no Answer, till his return to <HI>Cork,</HI> in his way home at <HI>Mayall</HI> his actions produced this inclosed, up∣on which I took Order for shipping, to lye in all his Harbor mouthes, and declared my best assistance and succour, to my utmost power to all, whether Officers, Souldiers, or others, that would desert him, two dayes since he sent me leave to send to the Gentlemen in pri∣son, which I suddenly did, and yesterday received two Letters, one from Colonell <HI>Temple,</HI> the other from Sir <HI>William Fenton,</HI> the latter of which desires me to impart to your Honour his request, that you would be pleased to mediate to some of the honoura∣ble Houses of Parliament, that a Letter may be sent from them to my Lord <HI>Inchequin,</HI> desiring his trans∣mitting the imprisoned Gentlemen into <HI>England,</HI> to receive their triall there, which he desires you to be mindfull of. And that he farther advices you, that he conceives, that if the Houses would be pleased to send over Commissioners speedily, with some monies, that most, both Officers and Souldiers might be obtained, and so consequently the Garrisons, which (Sir) true∣ly is my opinion likewise: forasmuch as I have heard from some Officers with whom I have had some con∣ference: which is all at present I have to communi∣cate to your Honour, onely to subscribe my self,</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Declaration of severall eminent Commanders, late of the Army commanded by the Lord</HI> INCHEQUIN.</HEAD>
<P>IN obedience and difcharge of our trust to the Par∣liament of <HI>England,</HI> sitting at <HI>Westminster:</HI> we give this information under our hands, to be presented to them, which wee shall be ready to make good in our persons upon oath, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the Lord Baron of <HI>Inchequin</HI> Lord President of <HI>Munster,</HI> having been abroad with some part of his Army, whereof we are members: Did upon the third of this moneth upon his returne home, being at <HI>May∣alle</HI> send for us, who have hitherto subscribed to appeare presently before at his Quarters, which be∣ing performed, and all of us assembled together in his presence Chamber: His Lordship declared this unto us, that in order to the Nationall Covenant, and to that particular branch thereof, which concerns the re-investing His Majesty in his Thron: he had with the advice of his Officers taken a resolution to oppose the present pretended Parliament in <HI>England:</HI> who were forced by an Independent faction, they having broken all Oathes and Covenants, which they had made both to God and Man: and to that purpose, was now puting himselfe into a posture of defence: And that for the managing of this Designe, he had correspondency with the King, with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>generally all the Presbyterian party that were agreed with the King: who were resolved to endeavour to their utmost the re-inthroning the King, and restor∣ing a free Parliament, which hee fully declared this not to be: And for the better effecting and carrying on this Designe, he was resolved to joyne with the Lord <HI>Taff,</HI> and the whole <HI>Irish</HI> of the Province of <HI>Mun∣stor:</HI> who have assured him of their assistance, both with their persons and estates, and that he had now sent for us, who were onely the suspected party of the Army to report this to us, and to require of us our resolution whether wee all would comply with him in this or no: To which we answerd, We stood for the King and Parliament, as we had ever done, up∣on which he required us not to juggle with him, but to declare whether it was this present Parliament wee meant, for he said the truth was, they did not acknow∣ledge this to be a Parliament: To which we answered his Lordship, we could not comply with him: He still using many aggravations, to make good what hee had said against them, and further said, Hee ho∣ped to see this present Parliament laid flat on their backs by <HI>Michaclmas</HI> day, and that this was no rash resolution, but a premeditated action, he being con∣fident, that let it come to the worst it could, yet in spight of all, he would be able to procure good terms both for himselfe and the rest that adhered to him: and that which induced him cheifly to put it in pra∣ctice at present was, that he was now assured, he was before hand with the Independent party, which hee never was before; yet hee had thought for some time longer to have forborne his declaring, but yet some suspitions, the Vice admirall Captaine <HI>John
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>Crowther</HI> had of him; could not permit him to car∣ry it private any longer, in regard the said Captain <HI>Crowther</HI> had protested against him, and blockt up his Harbours. And his Lordship did further declare, that al which would not joyn with him in this design, he required them to depart and go for <HI>England,</HI> for that he would not permit any neare him, or in his Army, that would not faithfully comply with him in his intention; and as a motive to induce us to joyn with him, he informed us that he was certainly assur∣ed, that Collonell <HI>Jones</HI> had by order from the Par∣liament of <HI>England,</HI> made a cessation with <HI>Owen Roe Oneal,</HI> and that faction; who chose rather to enter into League with the Parliament then with the King: and in this respect hee would now joyne with the Lord <HI>Taffe,</HI> and <HI>Munster</HI> forces against the other. For the truth of all these we have hereto subscribed our names this seventh of <HI>April</HI> 1648, aboard the <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> in <HI>Kinsale</HI> Harbour.</P>
