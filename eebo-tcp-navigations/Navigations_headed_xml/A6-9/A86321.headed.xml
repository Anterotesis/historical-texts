<P>Whether occasioned by the <HI>griping Monopolie</HI> of some hoarding Officers; or through want of timely <HI>Recruits,</HI> alwayes found necessary for such In∣fant-settlements: or, through some <HI>fatal Conjunction</HI> of the superiour Lu∣minaties, (that <HI>frown</HI> by course with a <HI>squint</HI> and malignant Aspects on one
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>Nation or other,) I will not now dispute.</P>
<P>But that such a Mortality should proceed, either from the <HI>Clime,</HI> be∣ing scituate in the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> (a He∣resie unpardonable in the ancients;) or from any accidental <HI>Malignitie</HI> in any of the Elements, peculiarly <HI>en∣tail'd</HI> upon it, whereby it should be lesse habitable then any other most au∣spicious settlement remains here to be controverted.</P>
<P>The Decision whereof can be no better evidenced, then by a faith∣full</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Description, <HI>Of the nature of the</HI> Clime, <HI>and</HI> Soile.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FIrst therefore, it's Climate is placed betwixt the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> in 17 and 18. degrees of Northern Latitude; and therefore twice every
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>year subjected to the Perpendicular Beams of the Sun, whence it borrow∣ed the style of <HI>Torrid Zone;</HI> a name which did so <HI>bugbear</HI> and affright the credulity of our Ancestors, that they unjustly <HI>exil'd</HI> and <HI>raz'd</HI> it out from the habitable part of the world, (then monopoliz'd in the temperate <HI>Zones</HI>) till the more daring spirits of <HI>Colum∣bus,</HI> and others, convoy'd us to an ex∣perimental confidence in the contra∣ry; the <HI>Chariby</HI> Islands, <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> St. <HI>Kits, Mevis, Antego,</HI> &amp;c. having prov'd as happy to the com∣plexions and constitutions of <HI>English</HI> men; as <HI>Virginia, New England;</HI> nay as <HI>Portugal, Spain, Italy,</HI> or any other confines upon the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, all which notwithstanding, are scituate in the <HI>Temperate Zone;</HI> a term of Art that now Ironically scandalizes that vulgar division of the World into <HI>Zones</HI> habitable, (the <HI>Temperate Zones;</HI>) and inhabitable, the (<HI>Frigid,</HI> and <HI>Torrid Zone.</HI>) For I must avouch
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>that I have found the Air as sulphur∣ous and hot in <HI>England,</HI> in the moneths of <HI>Iune, Iuly,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> especially whilest the Sun was near the <HI>Meridian,</HI> as in the hottest seasons at <HI>Iamaica,</HI> whilest the Sun makes a dou∣ble in <HI>Cancer</HI>) or in <HI>Guiana,</HI> in the moneths of <HI>March,</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> whilest the Sun gallops or'e their <HI>Ze∣nith</HI> in the <HI>Aequinox.</HI></P>
<P>And this will appear to be no such prodigious a <HI>Paradox,</HI> if we be unde∣ceived of that vulgar errour, that the <HI>neighbourhood</HI> of the Sun is the only cause of extream heat, and it's <HI>elonga∣tion</HI> the reason of extremity of cold: for if so, our Summers would be equally hot one year, as another, and each day (after the Sun's departure from the winter <HI>Solstice</HI>) hotter then ano∣ther, 'till he had posted over his half∣direct stages to face about in retro∣grade <HI>Cancer</HI>) both which experience doth disprove; for though his <HI>appro∣priation</HI> and <HI>elongation</HI> be the same
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>every year, yet our Summers and Winters are not equally <HI>hot</HI> and <HI>cold,</HI> and therefore we must seek out for more intrinsecal and occult causes; which now (are not the <HI>Asylum</HI> of ignorance) since we can certainly a∣scribe them to the <HI>Sun's Conjunction</HI> (improperly termed an <HI>Aspect</HI>) and his <HI>Aspects</HI> with other <HI>Planets,</HI> toge∣ther with his <HI>configurations,</HI> with the <HI>Fixed starres:</HI> for the weather is usu∣ally the hottest with us in <HI>England,</HI> af∣ter the <HI>Sun</HI> hath taken his leave of us from his nearest visit, and most fervent Complement, in the foot of <HI>Gemini,</HI> with his old fashion'd <HI>Congee</HI> in the <HI>Right knee</HI> and <HI>shoulder</HI> of <HI>Orion,</HI> and <HI>Auriga:</HI> and our hottest seasons are the <HI>Dogge dayes;</HI> yet doth not the Sun accompany the lesser <HI>heavenly Dogge,</HI> till he come to his <HI>feminine</HI> nocturnal and unfortunate Lodging, which is in the eighteenth Degree of <HI>Cancer;</HI> of w<SUP>ch</SUP> more at large you may consult <HI>Astronomy;</HI> my business here
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>being only to present you with an <HI>Hi∣storical</HI> Truth.</P>
<P>And as the coldnesse of our Night∣air in <HI>England</HI> tempers our hottest and most <HI>canine</HI> seasons; so the fresh <HI>Breezes</HI> that rise alwayes with the Sun, doe fanne the <HI>sweltering</HI> and <HI>sultry</HI> Climes within the <HI>Tropicks:</HI> so that the dayes are usually as cold as the nights, except towards the morning, and then a culinary fire is had in re∣quest, though the Inhabitants are thought to be <HI>dandled</HI> in <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Lap, or (as the Poets feign) to have been scorch'd, when rash <HI>Phaeton</HI> mistook his way, in his unskill'd and unhappy Journey,
<Q><L>— <HI>magnae pereunt cum moenibus urbes:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cumque suis totas populis incendiae Gentes</HI></L>
<L><HI>In cinerem vertunt, sylvae cum mon∣tibus ardent,</HI></L>

<Q><L>This scorch'd soil <HI>Phaethon</HI> to Cin∣ders burn'd,</L>

<L>With hotter flames (if fame we cre∣dit may)</L>
<L>Then those he smutch't in <HI>Aethio∣pia.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But the Native <HI>Indians</HI> are sensible of no such extraordinary <HI>warmth;</HI> al∣wayes making a fire under their <HI>Ham∣mocks,</HI> that the piercing air disturb not their sleep.</P>
<P>And the <HI>English</HI> themselves that in∣habit almost under the Line in <HI>Suri∣nam,</HI> contemn not their Coverlets in the night; though indeed very few of them rest in beds, but Hammocks, which do somewhat the more expose the body to the inquisition of the searching vapours.</P>
<P>Yet as the extremities of cold in
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>these Regions betwixt the <HI>Tropicks</HI> are indisputably more remisse then in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> so the heat qualified with the benefit of the Breezes, more justly styles them <HI>Tem∣perate,</HI> then those <HI>Climates</HI> that have already falsly, (though with vulgar consent) <HI>usurp'd</HI> the Title.</P>
<P>And I must not credit my senses, if I should not affirm, that upon an im∣partial compare, I never came in more temperate <HI>Climes</HI> then those of <HI>Iamai∣ca, Hispaniola,</HI> St. <HI>Kits, Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. so slanderously calumniated; the heat in the day time being alwayes <HI>alloy'd</HI> with the <HI>Sea Breezes;</HI> and the nights, naturally cool, are by an interchange∣able and never-failing intercourse, re∣freshed with <HI>Land Breezes;</HI> and there∣fore <HI>authentically</HI> renowned (by the Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> and others,) above <HI>Bar∣bary, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> (though fam'd to be the world's Garden) as being neither so intemperately hot nor cold.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<P>Though the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Argu∣ments are only drawn from the Di∣ctates of his reason, neither back't nor reinforced with experience; now suf∣ficiently confirm'd by every <HI>Mariner,</HI> to take off the greatest <HI>sit-fast</HI> of incre∣dulity.

</LIST></P>
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>First then.</HI> Of the purely natural, or wild Pro∣ductions of this Island.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. With which, the <HI>Soil</HI> is so pre∣gnant and fertile, that Nature hath stor'd it in no niggardly nor <HI>novercal</HI> benevolence, with Oranges, Lymes, (or bastard Lemmons,) Guavars, Pomegranates, a kind of Pepper, that tastes like Cloves, and very Aromatick (known by the name of <HI>Iamaica</HI>-Pep∣per) with innumerable kinds of seve∣ral <HI>Fruits</HI> that have scarcely found a name in <HI>English</HI> with which the Woods are so universally <HI>crouded,</HI> that they are likewise incomparably stockt with abundance of <HI>Wild Hoggs,</HI> fat and large, that cannot but thrive well upon so bountiful <HI>Commons,</HI> as falls from the trees in a very liberal contribution; yet their <HI>Ordinary</HI> is not so free, but that it sometimes costs
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>them their lives; Their fat backs be∣traying their throats, to the no small advantage of the Hunters, and the whole Island.</P>
<P>Nor are the Woods a more plenti∣ful <HI>Nursery</HI> for the <HI>Hoggs</HI> then the <HI>Sa∣vana's</HI> are for the Beeves and wild Cat∣tel; in some of which one thousand would graze in a drove, till the too greedy and repented <HI>eagernesse</HI> of fel∣ling them by Gun shot, frighted them to the shelter of the Woods and Mountains; from whence now they dare scarcely <HI>peep,</HI> except secur'd with the covert of the night, (their now usual feeding-time in the <HI>Savana's,</HI>) and now but in smaller numbers.</P>
<P>An inconvenience wisely prevented by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> (that lately inhabited, and first <HI>stockt</HI> the Island) who alwaies on horse-back <HI>singled</HI> out the Beast he intended to kill, (if so wild as not to come to his <HI>Pen,</HI> amongst his tamer fellows) and with a sharp Iron in form of an <HI>half-moon,</HI> fastened to a staffe,
<PB N="12" REF="17"/><HI>hough'd</HI> him on both his hin-leggs; afterwards dispatching him at his lei∣sure.</P>
<P>With which two singular advanta∣ges, for the raising and encrease of <HI>stock,</HI> (either of Swine in the Woods, or Beeves in the <HI>Savana's</HI> or Plains,) is happy in <HI>Iamaica</HI> above any other Island or Settlement; (whether upon the Continent or Islands of <HI>America</HI>) at this day peopled by any <HI>English</HI> Co∣lony and Plantation; and will soon flourish above any other, if it want no due encouragement for the preser∣vation and defence of the <HI>Planters.</HI></P>
<P>Every ship that comes from the <HI>Wind ward</HI> Islands of <HI>Barbadoes, Mevis,</HI> St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> &amp;c. being crouded a∣bove convenience with all sorts of people.</P>
<P>For besides that the <HI>Soil</HI> yields not to any of the <HI>Chariby</HI> Islands in the plentifull produce of Sugar-Canes, Tabacco, Cotton, <HI>Maiz</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Potatoes, Yawmes, and the
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>like <HI>American</HI> Provisions: it hath three, or four singular and extraordi∣nary Advantages to enrich the Planter.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>First:</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. By the speedy raising a stock of Cattel, though from a very mean prin∣ciple, and beginnings: a notable Po∣licy in the thriving <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and especially, on <HI>Cuba,</HI> which is better <HI>peopled;</HI>) and 'tis this: Near some convenient place, in the Wood, that is best <HI>stored</HI> with all sorts of <HI>fruit-bearing</HI> Trees, as Orange-trees, a sort of Cabbage-trees, rag'd with berries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they build two or three little Houses, or more; by them called a <HI>Crawle,</HI> and in these, they first inclose these tame Hogs, with which they begin their stock, and there feed them; that after (being let out) they will come to the <HI>haunt,</HI> at the sound of a Horn; But if they be out of hear∣ing,
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>(they many times suspending all care of them for a week together) they goe out with three or four Dogs, that hunt them in; the whole Herd make∣ing homewards so soon as ever the Dogs do <HI>Bay</HI> them; unto which <HI>disci∣pline,</HI> if any of the Hogs be not con∣formable, his refractoriness cost's him his life; his keeper (for example sake) scarcely <HI>indemnifying</HI> him for the first fault.</P>
<P>Thus two or three <HI>Spanish</HI> slaves, (for a native <HI>Spaniard</HI> scorns the Em∣ploy) will look to six or seven hun∣dred Hogs, and provide them meat, not putting their Masters to a penny charge.</P>
<P>Which course may as effectually be managed upon <HI>Iamaica,</HI> in any part of the Island; unparallel'd by any other <HI>English</HI> settlement in the more <HI>VVind∣ward</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>For a stock of Sheep, Cows, Horses, Goats, and the like, there is excellent Pasture in the <HI>Savana's;</HI> some of them,
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>fourty, some fifty miles in circumfe∣rence, wherein the grasse springs fresh and green all the year long.</P>
<P>The Earth never recalling her lent sap (as she does mock the <HI>Europeans</HI>) by giving and taking again, every Moneth being an <HI>April;</HI> The Trees and Plants being never <HI>disrobed</HI> of their <HI>Phary-liveries,</HI> but wear their best clothes every day; in which <HI>prodiga∣lity</HI> they are licenc'd and born out, by their <HI>indulgent</HI> Parents, the Sun and the Earth; These Regions being their <HI>Darlings,</HI> and (to use Sir <HI>Walter Raw∣leigh</HI>'s stile (<HI>The Paradise of the world.</HI></P>
<P>In so much as here is plenty of food to relieve the Planters Cattel through∣out the year, needing no winter-<HI>hoard;</HI> The providence of the <HI>Ant</HI> being uselesse here.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another singular benefit to the Planter, is the large numbers of <HI>wild Horses,</HI> well shap'd and very servicea∣ble, being all bred of the <HI>Spanish Gen∣nets,</HI> one of these tam'd and well ma∣nag'd
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>may be bought for three pounds <ABBR><HI>sterl</HI></ABBR> which would yield six thousand pounds of Sugar at the <HI>Barbadoes:</HI> of which special advantage, in easing the charge of making Sugars, needs no di∣spute.</P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly, the said <HI>Savana</HI>'s are <HI>common</HI> to every man that will make use of them; For as they are good for little else: The <HI>woody</HI> ground produ∣cing the best Provisions for a family, as Corn, Potatoes, Plantanes, Cassauder, Sugar Canes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so seating your self upon the <HI>skirt</HI> of a <HI>Savana, bordering</HI> upon a Wood, you may with conve∣nience enjoy the benefit of both.</P>
<P>Again, as you may stock these Plains without limit; so you may have fifty Acres, <HI>per head,</HI> for your self and ser∣vants, freely <HI>assign'd</HI> and made over to you, in any place you best like to make your choice; so that the seat, you pitch upon, be not first taken up by a∣nother; whereas in St. <HI>Kits, Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. you cannot turn a Horse out but
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>he presently trespasseth upon his Neighbour, if not upon your own <HI>Canes:</HI> the most barren Rocks (even in the <HI>Scotland</HI> of <HI>Barbadoes</HI>) owning a Proprietor, and the whole Island pe∣stered with a super-numerary <HI>glut</HI> of Inhabitants; too small a Hive for such a <HI>swarm</HI> of people.</P>
<P>Lastly, I shall conclude the transcen∣dency of this Isle, by the abundant plenty of choice Timber trees and Wood for the Dyer's use, as <HI>Fustick, Brasiletta, Ebonies,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Log∣wood;</HI> (but not so effectual as that which grows in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Campeachee</HI>) together with choice of medicinal Drugs, as <HI>China</HI> Roots, Gum <HI>Guaic.

<HEAD>2. General. Second, <HI>Of the improv'd Productions of the Isle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the next place, the fruits of <HI>Iamai∣ca</HI> that are produc'd by the im∣provement of Art, will most metho∣dically present themselves to be con∣sidered; wherein I shall purposely o∣mit to give the Reader any account of those usual Houshold Provisions, of Cassawder, Corn, Potatoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor of those Merchantable Commo∣dities of Cotton, Indico, Tobacco, Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> common to it with the rest of the <HI>English</HI> Plantations; But presuming the Reader's acquaintance with those Fruits and <HI>Merchandize</HI> so vulgarly known; I shall only treat of those that are more rare and not to
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>be found in any other of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The first that I shall mention is the <HI>Cacoa.</HI> Walks, which are not few in this Island, some of them contain∣ing ten or twelve Acres of Ground, some more, some lesse: The Trees are about the bignesse of our largest Plum-trees in <HI>England,</HI> orderly set, like our <HI>Orchards,</HI> at the distance of 6, or 7. foot from each other; which <HI>Interstitiums</HI> are carefully <HI>weeded,</HI> and cleared from the Grasse, that the <HI>Ca∣coa</HI> Trees may without a <HI>Rival</HI> en∣gross the Sap and substance of the <HI>Soil,</HI> which is chosen the most fertile that can be got, and naturally <HI>skreen'd</HI> and shaded from the piercing rayes of the Sun; Nor indeed can any ground be better employ'd; the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> (who best understands the value of them) reckoning every one of his <HI>Cacoa</HI> trees to be worth him a piece of Eight <HI>per an.</HI> after it begins to bear, which is usually about seven yeares
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>after it's first planting; in which time they are once or twice <HI>transplanted</HI> for the first two yeares, &amp; especially in their <HI>Infancy</HI> must be <HI>protected</HI> from the scorching Sun by the favourable <HI>interposition</HI> of some shady Trees; and therefore the <HI>Plantane</HI>-Walks are usu∣ally made choice of, for such <HI>Nurse∣ries.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Fruit or Nuts of these Trees is made the so fam'd <HI>Chocoletta,</HI> whose virtues are hyperboliz'd upon every post in <HI>London:</HI> though we must con∣fesse it of excellent nourishment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> victualling for a long and wildernesse Journey, with no o∣ther Refreshment, then Cakes made of the Kernels of those <HI>Cacoa</HI> Nuts; which he dissolves in water for his meat and drink.</P>
<P>The Composition of these <HI>Cacoa</HI> Cakes or <HI>Chocoletta</HI> is now so vulgar, that I will not disparage my Reader by doubting his acquaintance in so known a <HI>Recipe,</HI> a very <HI>Crambe</HI> in other Authors.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
<P>Yet will it not be impertinent to render a most exact description of the Nuts, then is hitherto extant, either in the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Spanish</HI> writings, that have as yet come to my hands. <HI>Herrera</HI> and <HI>Acosta</HI> report this fruit to be less then an Almond; whereas Doctour <HI>Hernandez,</HI> or rather, <HI>Anthonius Rec∣chius</HI> in <HI>Hist. Plant. in Amer. excuss. Romae,</HI> 1651. describes it to be bigger then a <HI>Musk-million. Hernandez</HI> was imployed by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to give an account of the Physical rari∣ties and Plants of <HI>America,</HI> and to that purpose dispatched thither by the said <HI>Catholick</HI> King, and is therefore more creditable and authentick then <HI>Herre∣ra</HI> or <HI>Acosta:</HI> though indeed he does somewhat hyperbolize when he e∣quals this Fruit with the largenesse of a <HI>Musk-million;</HI> for the husk or cod is no bigger then the largest Pears in <HI>England;</HI> growing immediately out of the <HI>bole</HI> or body of the Tree, and <HI>stock</HI> of the branches, admitting not
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>so much as the <HI>intermedium</HI> or <HI>usher∣age</HI> of a twig, <HI>sprouting</HI> from the bot∣tome to the top, twice especially eve∣ry year, <HI>viz.</HI> in the moneths of <HI>Ianua∣ry</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> the chief moneths for the <HI>Harvest</HI> of them.</P>
<P>The outward crust, or <HI>put aminous</HI> husk, being broken, appears full of little <HI>kernels,</HI> or nuts, each of them <HI>inveloped</HI> in a <HI>slimy</HI> substance and <HI>film,</HI> of a <HI>phlegmatick</HI> complexion, but of a most relishing taste: under which is another <HI>shell,</HI> which when <HI>bak'd</HI> in the Sun, resembles the colour and sub∣stance of a Chesnut; but the kernel is of a <HI>Chesnut-hue</HI> both within and without, and of this is made the <HI>Cho∣coletta</HI> Cakes; full of an oily substance, not unlike that of the oil of Almonds <HI>per expressionem:</HI> and of this meanest Labourer in <HI>Iamaica</HI> compounds his <HI>Morning draughts,</HI> wherein though he fares like a <HI>Gallant,</HI> yet his follow∣ing Musick upon the <HI>Hoe-boy</HI> (where∣in he practiseth to keep his hand in
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>use, and sometimes till his heart akes) doth more melodiously affect his masters eares then his own, and seems more harmoniously consonant to his <HI>Canvas-Drawers,</HI> which are also the sometimes ornament of the Petti∣coat-Sex (through the rigour of their Masters <HI>unmanumitted;</HI>) so that here likewise the women, (though not with that complacency) sometimes wear the <HI>Breeches.</HI></P>
<P>In the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> the Coast of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> and also in most places of <HI>Nova Hispaniola:</HI> two of these lit∣tle <HI>Cacoa</HI> Nuts (or Kernels) pass cur∣rant for one farthing, with which (as good sterling) they <HI>truck</HI> in the Markets.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Coco</HI> Nuts, which grow on a smooth and slender Tree, whose <HI>wast</HI> (in circumference) equals that of a man's; but it's <HI>stature</HI> doubles his height.</P>
<P>Upon the top of whose <HI>Bulk,</HI> the Nuts in small clusters doe <HI>germinate</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>immediately from the Tree, at the footing of the branches.</P>
<P>The Nuts (with the Husk on) is of a <HI>Pyramtdal</HI> form and may <HI>vte</HI> dimen∣sions with the greatest Logger-head.</P>
<P>The outward <HI>rind</HI> or <HI>husk</HI> is of a <HI>fibrous,</HI> spongy substance, about an inch thick, warily guarding, with su∣perfluous charinesse, the inclosed shell, whose <HI>Negro-skull</HI> is not easily broke.</P>
<P>In some Countries (as in <HI>Guinee</HI>) the Natives, <HI>card</HI> out this Rind into a kind of course Tow, which serves them for Cordage, Cables, Okam, and Ropes to <HI>rigge</HI> their Ships; whose <HI>Hulls</HI> and <HI>Masts</HI> (as is reported) are shap'd out of the body of the Tree; and <HI>victualled,</HI> only with the <HI>Nuts,</HI> in whose <HI>content,</HI> is <HI>barrell'd</HI> up both Drink and Bread; a milky liquour running out, so soon as you give it vent: for which purpose nature hath trim'd it with three <HI>bung-holes</HI> at the top.</P>
<P>Thus one Tree sets up a <HI>Marriner,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>and an <HI>Orchard</HI> sets out a Fleet: and at the return of the <HI>Voyage,</HI> the Sea-men are contentedly paid off with this Fruit alone; which serves for money, meat and drink.</P>
<P>And indeed the milky juice is a most ambrosian Dainty, very <HI>Diuretick,</HI> and proper <HI>Pharmacy</HI> for <HI>Nephritick</HI> di∣stempers.</P>
<P>Of the shells (<HI>polished</HI>) are made ve∣ry handsome Drinking-cups, in which Office, they serve us for rarity here in <HI>Europe.</HI> But they make no such use of the <HI>Rind</HI> at <HI>Iamaica;</HI> the inner Bark of a kind of Fig-tree furnishing them (by the <HI>Negroes</HI> Art) with all sorts of <HI>Cor∣dage,</HI> usefull in a Plantation.</P>
<P>This tree <HI>parturiates</HI> every Moneth, and will have fifty or sixty Nuts at a <HI>burthen.</HI></P>
<P>If you cut the Bark of the Tree or Fruit (whilest green) there issues forth a <HI>Nectar,</HI> like that of the <HI>wounded</HI> Vine; or the <HI>English</HI> Birtch-tree <HI>perforated</HI> in the spring, but of a far more <HI>aroma∣tick</HI> taste.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
<P>I purposely omit to speak of other pleasant Fruits in the Countrey, that are either common with other Islands, or not transported into <HI>Europe:</HI> be∣cause I would not puzzle the Reader with hard names, nor <HI>Tantalize</HI> him with a Discourse of Dainties, that he is never like to tast in <HI>Europe;</HI> and those that goe thither, need no Tutor.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Cacoa</HI> and <HI>Coco</HI> Nuts are Merchantable Commodities, enhan∣ced for their singular use and de∣light.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with one rarity more, of which in <HI>Iamaica</HI> is too great a plenty; and that is the <HI>Alligator,</HI> or <HI>Indian Crocodile,</HI> an amphibious Creature, that (like an <HI>Otter</HI>) haunts both the land and water.</P>
<P>I have seen many of them upon <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> but never any in the <HI>Cha∣riby</HI> Islands, nor in the Wind-ward Settlements upon the Main.</P>
<P>It would be too long to tell what
<PB N="27" REF="24"/>large feats are storied of this Beast; as that he will pull the Bulls into the wa∣ter, (catching them like a <HI>keen</HI> Ma∣stiffe by the cheek) when they come to drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This is true, that they have an incomparable strength in the water, in which as their most friendly Ele∣ment, they do usually encounter the <HI>prey,</HI> especially, if the mastery, will re∣quire their utmost strength in the <HI>grap∣ple.</HI></P>
<P>But though he <HI>winnes</HI> the <HI>field</HI> in the water, (with a <HI>Bull</HI>) yet he must share the <HI>Spoil</HI> on the shore; for he cannot (without the danger of drown∣ing) swallow his <HI>Booty,</HI> through an impediment in his throat. Some of them (I have seen) six or seven yards long, but their usual <HI>stretch,</HI> may <HI>bate</HI> the half; And indeed, though they are fierce and <HI>ravenous,</HI> yet at the approach of a man, whilest they lie <HI>basking</HI> upon the Sands, they betake themselves, (though with no great
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>haste) into the water; yet is it not ve∣ry safe <HI>sleeping</HI> near the shoar where they haunt, lest they take you napping. Yet can they not prejudice a child that is but aware of them: For their mo∣tion is very slow; neither can they turn the head, but the whole bodie must wheel for company.</P>
<Q><HI>Dat Deus immiti cornua curta</HI> —</Q>
<P>There is as good Civet in the Cods of an old rammish <HI>Alligator,</HI> as in the <HI>Ginney</HI> Civet Cats.</P>
<P>I shall not mention here the plenty of all sorts of Fish, and wild Fowl, as <HI>Ginney</HI> Hens, Ducks, wild Pigeons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because these Collections shall take notice onely of what is singular in this Island, without a Co partner, or any Parallel in any other Settle∣ments of our Countrey men.</P>
<P>But possibly amongst these Rarities some will expect I should (as the most welcome Newes) discover some <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Silver</HI> or <HI>Gold;</HI> as the most undoubted transcendency of a rich Land

<PB N="32" REF="27"/>(that were lately Slaves to the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> in this Isle) tell us, that their Ma∣sters did certainly know of two Silver Mines; yet are they not hitherto found by the <HI>English;</HI> whose <HI>scrutiny</HI> there∣in is not very <HI>prying</HI> and exact, the which, though astured, were no po∣licy to divulge, till their numbers be encreased, and their foot hold se∣cured; Arguments, that perswaded the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to reclose and dam up a rich Silver Vein in a Mountain near the Sea, a few Leagues to the Norward of <HI>Cape St. Nicholas,</HI> at the west-end of <HI>Hi∣spantola:</HI> not daring to present such a temptation to the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> till his Mines in <HI>Petozo, Peru,</HI> and new <HI>Spain</HI> be worn out; that his spare hands then may not only extract, but secure the <HI>Oare;</HI> a prize, which if now expos'd to publick notice) would create him many an unwelcome <HI>Ri∣val,</HI> that would not be to seek of pre∣tences enough, to further his <HI>suit:</HI> since our mother Earth doth in∣differently
<PB N="33" REF="27"/><HI>prostrate</HI> her womb to the common embraces of any <HI>Ravisher,</HI> that hath <HI>Arms</HI> strong enough to se∣cure him, in the Rape; the only <HI>Pa∣tent</HI> that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> can show for his <HI>Indie</HI>-Mines.</P>
<P>Which himself very well knows, and is therefore very unwilling to di∣spute his Title, but where he can <HI>em∣pannell</HI> an Army, instead of a <HI>Iury</HI> to make good the <HI>Claime;</HI> the which he can hardly <HI>levie</HI> upon <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> it being so thinly peopled, that he can scarcely muster five hundred fighting men, (in the whole Island) though he should put forth a general <HI>Presse</HI> (en∣forc'd with the strictest Commission of <HI>Aray;</HI>) except only in the Town of St. <HI>Domingo;</HI> which is distant above one hundred and fifty miles from the forementioned Mine; and are not a∣ble with all their skill and strength to root out a few <HI>Buckaneers</HI> or Hunting <HI>French-men,</HI> that follow their Game, in despight of them, though they can∣not

<HEAD><HI>I shall novv give you a more parti∣cular Description of this Isle, with it's Harbours, Tovvns, Ports, Soundings, exactly re∣presented in this</HI> Map, <HI>to your vievv.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHerein the chiese Harbour at Point <HI>Cagway</HI> merits Prece∣dency, lying North-West from the said <HI>Point</HI> in an <HI>Arme</HI> of the Sea, that <HI>shoots</HI> in three or four Leagues with∣in the Land.</P>
<P>Where 1000. tall ships may safely <HI>ride</HI> at one time, and all sufficiently <HI>shelter'd</HI> from winds and waves; and if they please, close aboard the shore, for an <HI>English</HI> mile in length, incom∣parably convenient for <HI>careening</HI> ships of all Burthens.</P>
<P>Upon this Point or sandy Bay is now built above five hundred houses,
<PB N="36" REF="29"/>by the <HI>English,</HI> chiefly for the accom∣modation of Sea-men, especially the <HI>Privateers,</HI> who are their best Customers; and sometimes, as now it is, the Residence of the General, and some Merchants and Manufactures; whose shares to build upon is mea∣sured out to them by the <HI>Foot,</HI> and that immediately forfeited, if not forthwith improv'd by Buildings, which now almost cover the <HI>face</HI> of the <HI>Bay</HI> for a mile in length; the breadth thereof being variable, some∣times <HI>borrowing</HI> of the two Seas, in whose Armes it lies, and then <HI>repaying</HI> with unequal <HI>Interest;</HI> so that about a mile from the Harbour's mouth, it is almost <HI>Bankerupt.</HI></P>
<P>The Bank in that place not extend∣ing to above half a Cables length in bredth: where, if cut through from Sea to Sea, (which very little labour would effect.) This <HI>Isthmus</HI> would lose it's name in an Island; And the <HI>Conversion</HI> conduce much to it's secu∣rity.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="29"/>
<P>For there is no landing upon the South-side of the <HI>Bay</HI> (which is wash'd and Buts upon the main Seas) by rea∣son of the fury of the waves (not pa∣cified by any <HI>Breakers,</HI>) even in the becalmest seasons.</P>
<P>And the entrance into the Harbour is commanded with a Fort, built by the <HI>English:</HI> wherein there are at this day, some as good Canon planted, as the Tower of <HI>London</HI> would afford, yet the <HI>Bay,</HI> (or said Town) consisting on nothing but loose sand (in most places whereof you have water, in sinking but three or four foot) admits no sufficient defence in Teneable Bul∣works, without the Tribute of for∣reign Materials; which are not far to seek.</P>
<P>The worst is, their water, which is infected (by the intrusion of the Neigh∣bour-seas) with a brackish taste; and therefore they make use of none but what is fetch'd three or four leagues in Boats and <HI>Canoues.</HI></P>
<PB N="38" REF="30"/>
<P>Which incovenience disswaded the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from gracing it with so much as one house, seating themselves near a pleasant River, and by the side of a most lovely <HI>Savana,</HI> in the famous Town of
<LB/>St. Jago de la Vega.</P>
<P>WHich was as well built, and as large as any Town in <HI>England;</HI> but now hast lost much of it's <HI>pristine</HI> lustre, since the Landlords became <HI>English;</HI> for it did contain two thou∣fand Houses, and upwards, with six∣teen Churches and Chappells, when it was first <HI>seized</HI> upon by the Army con∣ducted by Gen. <HI>Venables;</HI> now there remains only the <HI>Skeletons</HI> of two Churches and an <HI>Abbey,</HI> with about five or six hundred Houses; some of which are yet very pleasant and habi∣table.</P>
<P>This Town was first founded by <HI>Columbus,</HI> to whose happy search, the
<PB N="39" REF="30"/><HI>West-Indies</HI> first discovered it self; (all former Commerce and Traffick thi∣ther being till then <HI>adjourn'd</HI> beyond the <HI>Records</HI> of Time and Memory) bur now by him reviv'd to Correspon∣dency. He was the first <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>God-father</HI> to this Town, giving it the name of <HI>St. Iago de la Vega;</HI> which it <HI>reciprocally</HI> retorted to him in his, and his yet remaining Families Title of Honour) by the good pleasure of the King of <HI>Castile,</HI> created Duke <HI>de la Vega;</HI> famous in <HI>Spain,</HI> even to this day.</P>
<P>Here is plenty of <HI>Cassta Ligrea,</HI> and Oranges of excellent relish in abun∣dance, with some other choice <HI>Fruits,</HI> the Fruits of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Industry.</P>
<P>The mentioned <HI>Savana</HI> that faces this Town is now pretty well stockt with Sheep, Goats, Cowes, and espe∣cially tame Horses. But it did contain many thousands of each whilest the <HI>Spaniard</HI> own'd it.</P>
<P>The back-side of the Town is
<PB N="40" REF="31"/>wash'd with a fair, but unavigable Ri∣ver which buries it self in the Sea <HI>Pas∣sage-Fort.</HI></P>
<P>About twenty or thirty years agoe, this Town was wonne by a little Fleet of <HI>English men,</HI> fitted out from the <HI>Chariby</HI> Islands, chiefly from Sr. <HI>Kits,</HI> under the Command of Gen. <HI>Iackson,</HI> who landed about five hun∣dred men at <HI>Passage-Fort,</HI> and fought his way up to the Town, against two thousand <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who still fled be∣fore him; but some what retarded his <HI>Carcer,</HI> by six or seven several Breast∣works, cast up athwart the Road, on purpose to Bulwark this Town, (the Jewell of this Isle) from such Inroades and sudden surprizals: For the pre∣vention whereof they kept continual watch upon a great Hill that overlooks the Sea, the Harbour, and the Town, from whence the Centinells, in the twinkling of an eye by tokens agreed upon, signified the imminency of ap∣proaching dangers; As at this time
<PB N="41" REF="31"/>when Gen. <HI>Iackson</HI> made the On-set; the strength of the Isle being drawn up on the shore, before he could land his men; whom, though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> some what resisted, and at their several Brest-works caus'd them to make an unwilling Halt; yet the fury of <HI>Iack∣son</HI>'s men, greedy of spoil, overcame all difficulties, neglecting dangers in comparison thereof: Thus with the losse of fourty men, forcing to the Town, plunder'd it, to their no small enrichment. The booty likewise be∣ing advanced by a large <HI>Fine</HI> paid him by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> on condition the Town might be preserved from burn∣ing; which was accordingly sav'd, and their retreat to the Fleet undisturb'd.</P>
<P>But when the swelling <HI>Armado</HI> with Gen. <HI>Venables,</HI> attempted this Town, (after their worse successe against <HI>St. Domingo</HI>) they beat the bush so long, till the Bird was flown. For the subtle <HI>Spaniard,</HI> belaying our men with par∣leys, and fair words, in the interim di∣spatches
<PB N="42" REF="32"/>away Bag and Baggage; sometimes sending Beeves to stay the stomacks of the hungry Soldiery; and bearing Gen. <HI>Venables,</HI> in hand with choice <HI>Viands;</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Dainties presented to his Lady, who had more mind to eat then fight.</P>
<P>Thus staving them off, till their <HI>Train</HI> and best Movables had got so much <HI>Law,</HI> that afterwards the swiftest pursuit could not give them a <HI>Turn,</HI> before they had got <HI>Covert</HI> in their Fastnesse, the Woods.</P>
<P>And certainly, the treasure they car∣ried with them could not but be very considerable if we may guess at the worth of the Jewell by the splendor of the Cabinet, that kept it: or estimate the largeness of the Bird by the Nest: the <HI>Town</HI> being then even to magnifi∣cence, adorn'd with spatious Hou∣ses.</P>
<P>For the safe-guard whereof the <HI>Spaniards</HI> never durst <HI>cope</HI> with our men in the plain field; yet would
<PB N="43" REF="32"/>sometimes gawl them, when befriend∣ed with the treachery, that night and the Woods do afford; in which clandestine encounters, though at first the <HI>Spanish</HI> successe was too fortunate; yet dear bought experience did in a little time train up our men in the same <HI>Mysteries:</HI> in which now they are grown so perfect, that they never ceast beating both <HI>Spaniard</HI> and <HI>Ne∣gro</HI> at their own Play, and with their own weapons, till they had cleared the Island of them; In despair now of Recovery (being so often refrustrated in their reattempts,) except by some invincible <HI>Armado,</HI> which yet will find work enough, e're they make the Island too <HI>hot</HI> for the <HI>English,</HI> now naturaliz'd to the Countrey, and can never want shelter nor victuals whilst they have the Woods to befriend; with which now they are so well ac∣quainted, that the <HI>Molottoes</HI> and <HI>Ne∣groes,</HI> (which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> left be∣hind them to keep possession of the
<PB N="44" REF="33"/>Island, therein <HI>reckoning</HI> without their <HI>Host,</HI> presuming them unconquera∣ble, and past finding out) are now so overmatch'd in their own <HI>Arts,</HI> that their Captain and the major part of them have submitted; thereby les∣sening their master's <HI>Title</HI> by eleven Points of the <HI>Law;</HI> and craving <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> protection; into which, they are upon submission received, by the tru∣ly Honourable General <HI>Dawley,</HI> and now authoriz'd to prey upon, and <HI>hunt</HI> their fellows, that in scattered Parties yet stand it out, having already <HI>sealed</HI> their Allegiance with the bloud of their old Associates, not without the dextrous contrivement of that Noble General, whose happy policy in the wary preservation of this For∣lorn in <HI>Iamaica,</HI> hath already without the suspicion of flattery, authoriz'd the style. To whom our Nation, in some measures stands indebted for the <HI>Reprizal</HI> of that honour at <HI>Rio-Novo,</HI> which was so shamely lost un∣der
<PB N="45" REF="33"/>the debauch'd conduct of Gen. <HI>Venables</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> till then having so mean and despica∣ble thoughts of <HI>English</HI> courage, that upon the On-set at <HI>Rio-Novo</HI> they up∣braided our men with the opprobri∣ous mention of <HI>Sancta Domingo,</HI> till the repented assay of their valour, di∣sciplin'd them into better manners.</P>
<P>For though the numbers of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces at <HI>Rio-Novo</HI> doubled the <HI>English</HI> (being sent from <HI>Cuba</HI> to reinforce and resettle the Island) and those strongly entrenched; yet such was the enraged earnestnesse of the Souldiery to redeem their wounded Honours, that (regardlesse of all odds and disadvantages) they <HI>storm'd</HI> them in their trenches with a resolution as undaunted as the successe was prospe∣rous. Hereby not only <HI>retriving</HI> the <HI>Pristine</HI> same of their Countrey-men; but also hitherto <HI>frustrating</HI> all hopes in the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of further attempts to <HI>regain</HI> the Island.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="34"/>
<P>Another Party of <HI>Spaniards</HI> reseat∣ing themselves at <HI>Point-Pedro,</HI> being attended with a no lesse inauspicious <HI>fate.</HI></P>
<P>And the truth is, the Island, though it were lesse fruitfull, is worth the fight∣ing for, thou it should cost the <HI>Spani∣ard</HI> some of his best bloud; for it lies within his Bowels, and in the heart of his Trade.</P>
<P>For all the treasure that his Plate-Fleet brings home from <HI>Carthagina</HI> steer directly for St. <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI> and from thence must pass by one of the ends of this Island to <HI>reco∣ver</HI> the <HI>Havana,</HI> The common ren∣dezvouse of this whole <HI>Armado,</HI> be∣fore it returns home through the <HI>Gulf</HI> of <HI>Florida.</HI> Nor is there any other way (whereby to miss the Island of <HI>Iamaica</HI>) because he cannot in any rea∣sonable time turn it up to the Wind∣ward of <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> the which though he might with difficulty perform, yet he would thereby loose the security of
<PB N="47" REF="34"/>his united forces, which at the <HI>Hava∣na</HI> (from all the Parts of the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico, New-Spain,</HI> and the rich Merchandize that comes by <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> from the South Seas,) accom∣pany each other home from the said general <HI>Rendezvouse.</HI></P>
<P>So that the <HI>Privateers</HI> from <HI>Iamai∣ca</HI> are often fingering the Plate, and other precious commodities, that was never <HI>consign'd</HI> to them; by pick∣ing up their single and stragling Ves∣sels before they are <HI>ensur'd</HI> by their embodied Fleet.</P>
<P>In which respects (as in many o∣thers) Necessity hath made a better choice of a seat for the <HI>English</HI> Do∣minions, then their intended surprizal of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> though it had been at∣chieved: And their <HI>winnings,</HI> (if the <HI>Game</HI> be followed) will unexpectedly outvie the <HI>stakes.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot but take notice of the many convenient <HI>Harbours,</HI> ad∣judg'd by the most experienced <HI>Ma∣riners</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="35"/>to equal the best that they ever came to Anchor in. For besides that already mentioned at <HI>Point Cagg way.</HI> There is another (nothing inferiour) below it to <HI>Lee-ward</HI> at about four or five Leagues distance; and may as conveniently serve the Town of St. <HI>Iago,</HI> as that other at <HI>Cagg-way;</HI> they being triangularly scituated: It is usu∣ally known by the name of <HI>Old Har∣bour,</HI> where four hundred tall ships may ride together without danger of falling foul upon one another.</P>
<P>And about fourteen Leagues to <HI>Wind-ward,</HI> is another safe Port called by the <HI>Spaniards Porto Morant,</HI> which yet retains the name. In the Confines whereof a Regiment is seated; who with many other Planters, have now made themselves considerable in the Produce of Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>These <HI>Acteon</HI>-straglers (that sel∣dome number above five or six in a company) are often affronted with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Rounds (consisting of a∣bout one hundred Fire-locks) that once a year compass the Island, yet dare they never <HI>cope</HI> with these reso∣lute Champions, &amp; wandring <HI>Knights;</HI> who, setting back to back, would make sure to sell their lives at a dou∣ble rate, and in that posture bid de∣fiance to the Enemy.</P>

For had not the Belly been <HI>Magister artis,</HI> putting the Soldiers to their shifts, to silence it's importunities, they had never prov'd so good Marks-men, nor had come so familiarly acquainted with the Woods: whose skill therein hath now stood them in so good stead, for the stubbing up those <HI>Spa∣nish Negroes,</HI> that till then lay as thorns in their sides, that they could scarce stir abroad without being prick'd.</P>

<P>This only inconvenience attended the Soldiery of <HI>Iamaica,</HI> that finding
<PB N="76" REF="49"/>their leggs, and able to stand by them∣selves without the assistance of a Pro∣vidore, they became more refractory, and head-strong, and of a lesse bound∣ed discipline: acknowledging but small Homage where they received so small Pay; which did the rather sub∣ject them to mutiny, and easie to be wrought upon by more working Pates.</P>
<P>Nor did this licentiousness long want the misimproved subtilty of a Gentleman, one Lieut. Col. <HI>Raymond,</HI> a discontented Souldier, that wanted nothing but a better <HI>Employ,</HI> to set out his <HI>vast</HI> Parts: and had he not encoun∣tred with a General, that is cunning enough, and prov'd himself at all <HI>Ma∣chievilltan</HI> assayes, his <HI>Match;</HI> he had certainly reduc'd the Forces in <HI>Iamaica,</HI> into a self-destroying <HI>Flame;</HI> especially now their discontents had <HI>heated</HI> them to so (<HI>tinder-like</HI>) a touch∣inesse, that they were ready to take <HI>fire</HI> on all occasions. Nor were these

<P>Nor were those fickle-headed Soul∣diers
<PB N="78" REF="50"/>so soon invited to rise in Arms with them, but they sooner deserted them: leaving them to the Mercy of their Opponents Court-Mashalls, who presently doom'd them, to be shot to death.
