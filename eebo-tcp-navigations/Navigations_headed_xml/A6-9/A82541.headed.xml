<HEAD>The <HI>ANSWER</HI> of the Parliament of the Common∣wealth of <HI>England,</HI> to Three Papers presented to them by the Councel of State, from the Ambassadors Extra∣ordinary of the Lords the States General of the United Provinces; The First whereof is dated the Third of <HI>June,</HI> the Second the Sixth of <HI>June,</HI> and the Third the Thirteenth of <HI>June, 1652. new Stile,</HI> upon occasion of the late Fight between the Fleets.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Parliament of the Commonwealth of <HI>England,</HI> calling to minde with what continued Demonstrations of Friend∣ship and sincere Affections, from the ve∣ry beginning of their intestine Troubles they have proceeded towards their Neighbors of the United Provinces, omitting nothing on their part that might conduce to a good correspon∣dence with them, and to a growing up into a more near and strict Union then formerly, Do finde themselves much surprized with the unsutable Returns that have been made thereunto, and especially at the Acts of Hostility lately committed in the very Roads of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> upon the Fleet of this Commonwealth, the matter of Fact whereof stated in clear Proofs, is hereunto annexed; Upon serious and deliberate consideration of all, and of the several Papers delivered in by Your Ex∣cellencies to the Councel of State, the Parliament thinks fit to give this Answer to those Papers:</P>
<P>The Parliament, as they would be willing to make a charitable construction of the Expressions used in the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>said Papers, endeavoring to represent the late Engage∣ment of the Fleets to have hapned without the knowledge, and against the minde of Your Superiors; So when they consider how disagreeable to that profes∣sion the Resolutions and Actions of Your State and their ministers at Sea have been, even in the midst of a Treaty offered by themselves, and managed here by Your Excellencies, the extraordinary Preparations of One hundred and Fifty sail of Men of War, without any visible occasion but what doth now appear (a just ground of Jealousie in Your own judgments, when Your Lordships pretended to excuse it) and the Instru∣ctions themselves given by Your said Superiors to their Commanders at Sea, Do finde too much cause to be∣lieve, That the Lords the States General of the United Provinces have an Intention, by Force to usurp the known Rights of <HI>England</HI> in the Seas, to destroy the Fleets that are, under God, their Walls and Bulwarks, and thereby expose this Commonwealth to Invasion at their pleasure, as by this late Action they have attem∣pted to do: Whereupon the Parliament conceive they are obliged to Endeavor, with Gods assistance, as they shall have opportunity, To seek Repairation of the Wrongs already suffered, and Security that the like be not attempted for the future.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, with this minde and desire, That all Differences betwixt the Nations may (if possibly) be peaceably and friendly composed, as God by his Pro∣vidence shall open a way thereunto, and Circumstances shall be conducing to render such Endeavors less dila∣tory, and more effectual then those of this kinde here∣tofore used have been.</P>

<HEAD>A Narrative of the late Engagement betwen the English Fleet under the Command of General <HI>Blake,</HI> and the Holland Fleet under the Command of Lieutenant Ad∣miral <HI>Trump</HI> near <HI>Dover.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UPon Tuesday the Eighteenth of <HI>May</HI> 1652. in the morning, General <HI>Blake</HI> being gone to the West∣ward as far as <HI>Rye</HI> Bay eight days before with twelve or thirteen Ships, leaving Major <HI>Bourn</HI> in the <HI>Downs</HI> with eight Ships onely, there appeared upon the backside of the <HI>Goodwin</HI> a <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet of Men of War consisting of two and forty Ships, one whereof had a Flag on the main-top-Mast head, the rest Jacks and Ancients; and being come unto the South-sands head, two of them bore up towards the English Ships in the <HI>Downs,</HI> where∣upon Major <HI>Bourn</HI> sent out the <HI>Greyhound</HI> to examine them, and to know the reason of their so near approach; who answering, That they had a Message to the Com∣mander in chief in the <HI>Downs,</HI> were permitted to come in, and having saluted the Flag, the two Captains na∣med <HI>Tyson</HI> and <HI>Aldred</HI> came Aboard the said Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and acquainted him that they were sent by <HI>Van Trump</HI> to let him know that he had been Riding about <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with his Fleet, where by reason of foul Wea∣ther they had lost many of their Cables and An∣chors, and the wind being Northerly, were driven fur∣ther to the Southward then they intended, which <HI>Van Trump</HI> thought fit to signifie to prevent any misappre∣hensions or Jealousies. And having said this, and re∣ceived for answer, That the Reality of what they said would best appear by their speedy drawing off from this Coast, they departed to their Fleet; and immediately upon their arrival with them, the whole Fleet stood up
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>to <HI>Dover,</HI> and came to an Anchor within little more then shot of the Castle the same day in the afternoon. Upon their coming before <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, and Riding there with Flag in the Main-top, without saluting the Castle, the Castle made three shot at them; notwith∣standing which, the Dutch Admiral kept up his Flag, and rode there at Anchor until the next day noon, and exercised his Musquetiers, by discharging Volleys of small shot many hours together. Upon Wednesday about twelve a clock the Dutch Fleet weighed Anchor and stood off towards <HI>Calice</HI> some four Leagues into the South-east; about the same time the English Fleet un∣der General <HI>Blake</HI> coming from the West towards the <HI>Downs</HI> discovered them, and supposed by their course they had been going back; Major <HI>Bourn</HI> likewise was in sight, coming from the <HI>Downs</HI> to joyn with General <HI>Blake.</HI> About an hour or two after, the Holland Fleet altered their course, came back again, made all the Sail they could, and bore directly with General <HI>Blake, Van Trump</HI> the headmost with his Flag in the Main-top; and being come within shot, the General shot a Gun at his Main-top, and then two single shot more: whereupon <HI>Trump</HI> shot a single shot through the Generals Flag, and then immediately gave the first Broad-side and took in his Pendants, and hung out his Red Flag under the Holland Colours, which was the Signal on their part for their whole Fleet to ingage, and so the Fight began, which happened between four and five a clock in the af∣ternoon, and continued until nine of the clock. In the Fight the English took two of the Holland Fleet, one whereof having six foot water in the Hold they left, ta∣king the Captain and Officers aboard, the other being a Ship of thirty Guns. General <HI>Blake</HI> lay all night
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>where the Fight began, or near thereabouts, and the Holland Fleet was espyed about four Leagues distant towards the Coast of <HI>France</HI> next morning.</P>
<P>The truth of this Relation appears in the Letters of General <HI>Blake,</HI> Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and others in the Action, by the Examinations of the Dutch Captains, and other Officers taken in the Fight; the Instructions given to the Dutch Captains and Commanders, and other Pa∣pers, all which are hereunto annexed.</P>
<P>And whereas <HI>Van Trump</HI> in the accompt he gives of this Action, makes the occasion of his coming back upon the English Fleet, the guarding of some Mer∣chant men richly laden from the <HI>Streights,</HI> which had been in fight with some of our Friggots: That action is set down in a Letter written by Captain <HI>Yong</HI> (here∣unto also annexed) whereby the occasion, beginning and ending thereof is declared: And besides, these very Ships which he pretends to come to protect or re∣scue, upon Saturday before had past by General <HI>Blake,</HI> and were gone to the Eastward.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have dispatched away this Express to your Honors, to give you an account of what past yesterday be∣tween us and the Dutch Fleet being in <HI>Rye-Bay;</HI> I re∣ceived Intelligence from Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> that <HI>Van Trump</HI> with Forty Sail was off the South-sand head, where∣upon I made all possible speed to ply up towards them, and yesterday in the morning we saw them at Anchor in and near <HI>Dover</HI>-Road; being come with∣in
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>Three Leagues of them, they weighed and stood away by a wind to the Eastward: We supposing their intention was to leave us to avoid the Dispute of the Flag; about two hours after they altered their course, and bore directly with us, <HI>Van Trump</HI> the headmost, whereupon we lay by and put our selves into a fighting posture, judging they had a resolution to ingage; be∣ing come within Musquet shot, I gave order to fire at his Flag, which was done thrice, after the third shot he let flie a Broad-side at us; Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> with those Ships that came from the <HI>Downs,</HI> being eight, was then making towards us, we continued fighting till night, then our Ship being unable to sail, by reason that all our Rigging and Sails were extreamly shattered, our Mi∣zen-Mast shot off, we came with advice off the Ca∣ptains to an Anchor about three or four Leagues of the <HI>Ness</HI> to refit our Ship, at which we labored all the night; this morning we espyed the Dutch Fleet about four Leagues distance from ours towards the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> and by advice of a Councel of War, it was re∣solved to ply to windward to keep the weather gage, and we are now ready to let fall our Anchor this Tide; what course the Dutch Fleet steers we do not well know, nor can we tell what harm we have done them, but we suppose one of them to be sunk, and another of Thirty Guns we have taken, with the Captains of both, his Main-Mast of the first being shot by the Board, and much water in the Hold, made Captain <HI>Lawsons</HI> men to forsake her. We have six men of ours slain, and nine or ten desperatly wounded, and twenty five more not without danger, amongst them our Master and one of his Mates, and other Officers: We have received about seventy great Shot in our Hull and Masts, in our Salls
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>and Rigging without number, being engaged with the whole Body of the Fleet for the space of four hours: And the Mark at which they aimed, we must needs ac∣knowledge a great Mercy that we had no more harm, and our hope the Righteous God will continue the same unto us, if there do arise a War between us; they being first in the Breach, and seeking an Occasion to Quarrel, and watching as it seems, an Advantage to brave us upon our own Coast, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Major <HI>Bourn</HI>'s Relation.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the Eighteenth of <HI>May,</HI> the Wind being at North-East, the weather something haisie, about
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>Ten in the morning we saw a great Fleet on the back side of the <HI>Goodwyn sand,</HI> which lay with their sayls hayl'd up, and drove to the fouthward the later Tyde of Ebb in land; about twelve they were so nigh, that we plainly descried them to be all Men of War, consist∣ing of One and forty in number, one whereof had a Flag at the main Top-mast head, the rest Jacks and An∣cients, <HI>Hollands</HI> Colours, at which time they were near the <HI>South sands</HI> Head: There was in the <HI>Downs</HI> the <HI>Andrew, Triumph, Fairfax, Entrance, Centurion, Adventure, Assurance, Greyhound,</HI> and the <HI>Seven Bre∣thers,</HI> all the rest of the Fleet being with the General to the Westward, by whose special Command I wore a Flag at the main Top-mast head; the appearance of which I humbly conceive was one cause amongst others which moved their General to send two Frigots to∣wards me, which as soon as I perceived plying into the Road, I sent out the <HI>Greyhound</HI> to examine them, and know the ground of their Approach; who returned this Answer to the Captain, That they had a Message from their Admiral to the Commander in the <HI>Downs,</HI> at which he made sayl towards me, permitted them to come in, the two Frigots came near and saluted the Flag, and then the Captains came on Board, whose names were, one <HI>Tyson,</HI> and the other <HI>Aldred,</HI> who brought this Message from their Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> That by reason of much Northerly Winds, he with his Fleet was put the southward farther then he intended, and having Anchored the day before off <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> ma∣ny of his ships had lost Anchors and Cables, and so were forced to leewards; but withal declared, that they had special Command from their Admiral to signifie thus much, That it was the onely cause of their coming
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>to prevent any thoughts or misaprehensions, for that he had not the least purpose to offer injury to any of the English Nation, but for fear least any noise or Alarum should be given either at Land or Sea, he thought good to send this message. And further, the one of them in dis∣course said, that their Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> would have come himself into the Road, but that he was not willing to breed any difference about his Flag, forasmuch as he had not order to take it down: To whom I replied, That I presumed there would be no new thing required of them, and neither more nor lesse would be expected from them, but what they knew to be the ancient Right of this Nation; and withal I desired them to return this Answer from me to their General, That their Message was civil, that our General was to the West-ward, whom I looked for hourly, and that received; and if what they delivered was so intended, I desired the Re∣ality there of might be manifested by their speedy draw∣ing off from this place with their Fleet, for else this their appearance would be otherwise expounded; and so I dismissed them, who made sail to their Admiral who lay off the South-Sands head. I expected them to come into the Road every moment, and therefore was in readiness with the small strength I had under my charge; so soon as the two Friggots before mentioned came back to their General, they all made Sail and stood toward <HI>Dover,</HI> and there they came to an Anchor that Tyde. At the first appearance of them, after I had made them certainly to be the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, I did according to my duty give such an Accompt thereof to the Right Honorable the Councel of State, as the time and other business would admit, &amp; withal I immediate∣ly
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>dispatched a Ketch to our General, who met with the advise thereof that night about <HI>Nesse.</HI> All the next night we lay in readiness, our Anchors apeck, and kept two Friggots one at a distance from the other be∣twixt us and them, giving them Instructions to make a Signal to me either night or day, that I might under∣stand their motion whether towards, the General or else∣where, to the end I might the better be able to order my self and the party with me to the best advantage for security of the Generals Fleet and our selves. In the morning about ten a clock I received advice from the General being a little to the West-ward of <HI>Foulstone,</HI> and according to Order received from him, calculated the time and Tyde, so that we might most opportunely make conjunction of our Forces. About twelve a clock I set sail out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> the wind being Easterly, im∣mediately after I perceived the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to be under sail some of them, and the rest making ready: we steer∣ed alongst, and when we came as high as the South∣foreland, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Fleet was got off the Shore and were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Channel over plying to wind-ward towards <HI>Ca∣lice,</HI> at which time I saw our General and those with him, and within an hour after or thereabouts, the <HI>Hol∣land</HI> Fleet bore up and made Sail toward him; we hast∣ned towards him, and hope I may say, seasonably came in, for by that time the Guns were fired betwixt the Admirals, we were with the body of their Fleet and in∣gaged with them from half an hour past four in the afternoon till it was dark; what execution we did upon them they best know, I shall not determine it, but surely they were sensible of us, for they did their utmost to decline us and avoid our coming near, which we en∣deavored
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>by all means; but their Admiral leading the Van, they all made sail after him, and so shot them∣selves to Leeward of us, and so left the Rear of the Fleet to us, which we endeavored to sever from the rest, and accordingly did in part break the Body, and some of us who were the nearest and had the Advan∣tage of the Wind, fell upon the Stern most, who I suppose found it hot work; the one of them of thirty Guns we took which fought stoutly, another of the same force so lamed, her main Mast shot down, and having much water in Hold yielded, and the Captain thereof came in to our Boat to save himself; the night coming on and no hope left him, I presume she sunk in the night. We not knowing what might be the issue of this beginning, endeavored to finde out our Gene∣ral, to the end we might receive Instructions how to order our selves in the morning, expecting certainly to prosecute the business then, for which end we presently came to an Anchor, because we would be near them in the morning, but they did not stop, so that in the morn∣ing we could scarce discern them at Top-mast head; by which we concluded that they were bound over to the coast of <HI>France,</HI> and were not willing to try it farther at this time, and therefore that evening plyed it up to∣ward <HI>Foulstone,</HI> and between that and <HI>Dover</HI> anchored again, and the next day came into the <HI>Downs.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I was coming to the Westward to take the com∣mand of the West-guard the twelfth instant off the <HI>Start,</HI> I descried a Fleet of ships about a dozen sail, coming from the Southward, being Admiral, Vice and Rere in the Fleet, so that I did conceive them to be <HI>Sir George Ayscu's</HI> Fleet; but I making sail off to them, found them a Fleet of Hollanders came from <HI>Janua</HI> and <HI>Legorn;</HI> Those three with Flags were States-men of War their Convoyers, the other Merchants ships, some upwards of Thirty Guns and some under; so I bore with the Admiral, and did send him by my Master, That he should strike his Flag, and did desire a right understanding might be between us before any Blood was shed in the controversie; on this the Admiral took in his Flag and put abroad a Pendent, he said he did be∣long to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> but his name I know not, but the ship hath two wilde men or the like in her stern, and some other things between them, she hath some Thirty eight guns: so then the Vice-Admiral came up with me with his Flag abroad, being a ship of Forty two Guns, so I called to perswade him to strike, he bid me come on board and strike it, so I sent my Boat on board to per∣swade him to it to prevent the loss of Blood, if it might be, but he sent me word by my Master he would not strike; so then being fitted for it, I came up very near on the Weather-quarter, yet before I fired, I called to the Captain my self to take in his Flag, but he said he would not; so then I commanded a Broad-side and a Volley of small shot to be fired on him, and I received the like from him again: Thus we past some four or
<PB N="25" REF="13"/>five Broad-sides each at other, though I was forced to be at some further distance from him then the first, I fearing the Admiral would have laid me on Board on the Weather-side, he having fitted his ship, and come up Main-sail, and all to gain the Wind of me, forced me to keep the Wind of him; then Captain <HI>Reynolds</HI> being come up fair within shot of his weather quarter, having fired some six Guns be∣fore at the Rear Admiral, as he came in amongst us; so he fired part of a broad side at the Vice-Admiral, just at that instant as he was taking in his Flag, the <HI>Recovery</HI> being come up even within shot just as his Flag was in, and the Rear-Admiral struck likewise: So I sent aboard the Admiral, That I did demand the Vice-Admiral, either in his person or his ship to carry into Port, to make good what damage was done: He told my Master, he did not meddle in the least himself as yet, as long as it was onely about striking the Flag, the which he said was now taken in; but if I sought any further matter, as the surprizal of him or the ship, he was bound and would assist him, she being the States ship as well as he, not then knowing, or could take any notice of any further intentions: So I desired Captain <HI>Reynolds</HI> and Captain <HI>Chapman</HI> to come on board to consult with me what further to do in it, it being near night; and it was the judgment of us all, not to proceed any further in it, the Flags being taken in, by reason the Treaty being between the Nations at present, the case of Breach of the Peace might not be any way imputed on our part. I have received some damage in my Hull sail and rigging, the which I shall soon, God willing, get repaired again; I had one
<PB N="26" REF="14"/>man even as good as killed out-right, dyed since, and some Four wounded, but I hope they will recover: For my own part, I bless the Lord for it, I am very well; I do believe I gave him his belly full of it, for he sent me word he had Order from the States, That if he struck he should lose his head; but at length he did strike, which makes me conceive he had enough of it.</P>

<HEAD>A Paper delivered by the Lords Ambassadors to the Councel of State, the Third of <HI>June, 1652. new stile.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Honorable Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are here by reason of and unhappy an unex∣pected Mischance; An horrible Report hath amazed us, That a Fight at Sea should have been be∣twixt the Fleet of this Commonwealth and of the United Provinces, and That ours should have been the reason of this unfortunate business, That we began the Fight, and that thereupon is fought most cruelly; and that from thence the Rumor of the breaking of the Treaty, and of open War (which should be very near at hand between the two Nations) was spread: We astonished by this sad Report, direct our selves to this Honorable Assembly, and do Declare before God, and out of all our Hearts, That the Fact, so as it is re∣ported, is committed without the knowledge, and against the will of the States of the United Provinces
<PB N="27" REF="14"/>our Lords, and of us their Ambassadors. Moreover we do affirm, That the Hearts of ours do desire nothing but Unity, Peace, League, and a very near Friendship with this Commonwealth, and hope that with all their wishes. In the mean while, we do think it not to be amiss, if we give notice unto your Honors, That we have received Letters from the Admiral of the Fleet of the United Provinces, Dated the Thirtieth of the last Moneth, wherein the occasion and reason of the said Fight-quite otherwise is declared then the common Re∣port is: For the truth of which business, we suppose to be convenient to inquire exactly; But this is worth observation in the mean time, That our Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> in the same Letter doth declare plainly to have no other Order from the Lords the States, then to sail about, and to view the shore and coasts of our country, as far as <HI>Ostend</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI> and no farther. By which it doth appear as clearly as the Sun is under Heaven, That by all means the States of the United Provinces have had no minde to attempt any thing against the Fleet or other ships of this Commonwealth. If any thing then in this business be done otherwise then it ought to be, this doth not concern the said States, but them which have executed the said busines, and let them make it good. We have been here now almost six Moneths about the concluding of a League, by special Order of the said States, and have delivered some days ago to your Commissioners a Paper, in which not onely the different Points touching the Treaty, but also the means by which the same could be brought to a good Agree∣ment, and reconciled one with another, were sufficient∣ly declared; so that vve did expect nothing every day,
<PB N="28" REF="15"/>but a happy end to so good a Work; and truly that ex∣cellent matter may in very few hours be finished. But who should ever believe that so Noble a Work, and de∣sired vvith so many vvishes of all honest men, and espe∣cially of all the Churches of the Reformed Chri∣stian Religion, should be cut off or hindred by any such imprudent and turbulent man (whosoever he may be) without knowledge and against the will of the Lords the States? By Law of Nature and Cu∣stoms of all Nations is very well known, That he to whom a Charge is given in particular things, an Am∣bassador in Publique Business going beyond the limit of their Commissions, a General of an Army Depopu∣lating without order of his Superiors any Grounds of the Neighbors; a wilde beast doing any mifchief after it hath broken its bond, that not the Masters but those that have done the wrong are obliged, especially if the disapproving of the same Masters followeth thereupon; which without question (if the business be so as it is re∣lated) is to be expected from the States of the United Provinces. In the mean while we make no doubt, that to attempt any Hostility before the other party is heard, cannot be approved neither by God, nor by any men, especially Christians. It is a Custom by all rea∣sonable Nations to demand restitution of their Goods if any trouble be done, and in case Satisfaction be given or offered, to lay aside all Hostility. And it is no wonder that all Nations are so much against War and inclined to establish a Peace, the War being plainly a cruel mon∣ster, a world of evil, and a meer deluge of innocent blood; therefore the most holy Fathers of our Religi∣on have expresly declared the War (although just) to be
<PB N="29" REF="15"/>execrable, especially in relation to the Christians, who are taught by their meekest Savior to spare other mens blood as well as their own. But amongst all kinde of Wars, is this to be reputed the most detestable and hor∣rible if between these Nations War be risen. Truly the experience teacheth us, that the best and strongest Wine (if it be corrupted) becomes the sowrest Vineger; and indeed if two Nations having been friends of old times, of the same Religion, lovers of Liberty, joyning upon the same Sea, next Neighbors, both Valiant and Warlike be clashed together, what is to be expected but the Ruine of both, and as the Proverb saith, a Cad∣mean Victory. And what else is this then to afflict and depresse your Friends and Companions in Religion to please our Enemies, and to give occasion openly for to hurt them both. An Author, being none of the least amongst yours, hath very well compared, as we con∣ceive, both the Nations to two earthen Pots driving in the Sea with this device, If we hurt, we break; He hit∣ted it very well that honest man, and we may believe you are of the same opinion. But if the two Nations come to an Agreement, Oh Lord, what store of Hap∣piness will this bring forth! The true Gods Service will be established, the Sea be quiet, and Opportunity taken away from all Enemies to trouble them both; all Companions in Religion be resoiled, and which is to be reputed the chiefest of all, To the most good and gra∣cious Lord, Praises and Thanksgiving will be lift up in∣to the Heavens. We conclude then, most Honorable Lords, and instantly demand and desire, so as we have longed to propose to your Honors this three days since;</P>
<PB N="30" REF="16"/>
<P>First, That a Copy may be given unto us of the Re∣lation of the things that are past.</P>
<P>Secondly, That we may send that over by your leave to our Lords the States, and that the other part being heard, the truth of the Business may be known.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That in the mean while all things may be kept whole and untouched.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That by no means the Business of the con∣cluding of the Treaty be put off, and that such unfor∣tunate Mischances may be avoided, and an everlasting Peace may be established between both the Nations.</P>
<P>All which we desire of all our hearts, the great and bountiful God the Author of Peace will be pleased to grant us.</P>

<HEAD>The Translation of the LETTER of the Admiral <HI>Trump</HI> to the States Gene∣ral, mentioned in the precedent Paper.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mighty Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last Letter was of the twentieth in∣stant, sent by the Messenger that brought my Instruction aboard, since when I crossed the Sea before the Mase, <HI>Wis∣lingen, Ostend</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> until the twenty four of the same Moneth, when we were forced to cast our Anchor, and stay there in a hard weather and a rough sea, until the twen∣ty
<PB N="31" REF="16"/>six in the morning: The weather grow∣ing fairer, and being under Sail, divers Cap∣tains of the <HI>Direction</HI> came aboard, complain∣ing, That they lost their Anchors and Cables, some having but two Anchors &amp; two Cables left; It was resolved, because the wind did grow big, to go under the point of <HI>Dover</HI> for to prevent the loss of our Ships. At one of the clock coming before Downs, we did send the Commander <HI>John Thissen</HI> from <HI>Flissingen,</HI> and Captain <HI>Peter Alders</HI> towards the Downs to the Commander <HI>Bourn,</HI> who was there with some Ships of the Parliament, whom they saluted in my Name, advertising him that we were bound to cross the Sea about our coast; and that having lost some Anchors by the last hard weather, we were forced to Anchor under <HI>Dover,</HI> to help one another, and so to return to our appointed limits; ha∣ving also no other order, but to protect our Merchants Ships and Fishermen, and to maintain the honor of our Country: That we therefore thought it fit to acquaint the said Commander with the same, because he should not suspect any thing to the contra∣ry; who also with much courtesie did salute
<PB N="32" REF="17"/>me, and thank me for this notice. Upon the twenty nine, at two of the clock, we made sail, the wind North east, good weather, sai∣ling towards <HI>Calice,</HI> with intention to cross towards our coast, for to provide us of Ca∣bles and Anchors: Coming about <HI>Calice</HI> Cliff, we met with Captain <HI>Ioris van Sanen</HI> of <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI> coming out the <HI>Streights,</HI> with Captain <HI>Hugeluyt,</HI> having in their Company seven rich Merchants Ships, who are esteem∣ed above fifty Tuns of Gold, who he left the twenty nine at Anchor, right against <HI>Feverley,</HI> where about twelve Ships of the Parliament did lye, and divers Frigots came to see them; and for as much as the said <HI>Ioris van Sanen</HI> up∣on the twenty two of <HI>May,</HI> about <HI>Goutstart,</HI> was met a Frigot of the Parliament, who fiercely set upon him for to make him strike, and against whom he defended him neer about two hours, and so was left by the said Frigot, whereupon the said Commander <HI>Hugeluyt,</HI> and the said <HI>Van Sanen,</HI> should endeavor for to finde out our main Fleet, and to give us no∣tice of it; as he did accordingly, fearing much, That the said Merchants Vessels alrea∣dy might be taken: Whereupon I presently
<PB N="33" REF="17"/>went thither, to take them under my protecti∣on; and if they were taken, to put them at liberty, if it was possible, according to the seventh and eighth Articles of my Instruction of the sixteenth instant. Upon the way we met fifteen Ships and Frigots of the Parlia∣ment, among whom one was an Admiral, whom I intended to view, taking in all my Sails, except both my Murshot Sails, whom we did avail until the middest of the stangs. Being within a Canon-shot, he shot a Ball over our Ship, we answered not, he shot an∣other, to which we answered with one; pre∣sently he gives me a broad side, being within a Musquet shot, and shot all his side through our Ship and Sails: Divers were wounded, some with the loss of their Arms, some other∣wise; thereupon we presently gave him our broadside, not knowing what they intended, which for as yet I know not, because they did not speak a word to us, neither we to them, and we fell thereupon to a general fight. In mean while came the Commander <HI>Bourn</HI> out the Downs, with twelve of such like Ships and Frigots mounted, as he told him∣self to the said Commander <HI>John Thyssen,</HI> and
<PB N="34" REF="18"/>Captain <HI>Peter Alders,</HI> being aboard of him with sixty to seventy, and the Frigots with thirty eight to fifty pieces of Ordnance, who in the same while assaulted our Fleet from behinde; and we fought thus from half an hour past four till nine of the clock, the darkness departing us from another; when both the Admirals a little beyond the reach of their Ordnance cast their Sails towards the Lee for to gather their Fleets, and to mend what was shot to pieces, we floated the whole night with a light on every Ship. The thir∣tieth in the morning, we saw the English Fleet driven windward from us, who made Sail and went towards <HI>Dover.</HI> We wanted two of our Ships, who were in the rear of our Fleet: The Captains, <HI>Tuynmans</HI> of <HI>Middle∣bourgh,</HI> and <HI>Siphe Fooks</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> both Ships of the Direction, whereof we found that of Captain <HI>Siphe Fooks</HI> about noon float∣ing without Mast; The Skipper and the Officers declared unto us that they were ta∣ken by three Ships of the Parliament two hours after Sunset, who took from aboard the Captain and the Lieutenant, with four∣teen or fifteen men more, and putted instead
<PB N="35" REF="18"/>of them many of the English; but they fear∣ing that the Ship would sink, they took the flight, after they had plundred all in Hostile maner: They Declared also, That they see that the said <HI>Tuynmans</HI> (being with them in the rear of our Fleet) an hour before was ta∣ken: We intend with this Easterly wind to cross to and fro, that we may finde out the said <HI>Streight</HI> fearders, if it be possible, and with all other Ships with whom we may meet, to bring them safe in our Country: So ending was subscribed</P>

<PB N="36" REF="19"/>with the Councel about it with all uprightness, deliver∣ing them a Copy of <HI>Trump</HI>'s Lettershimself, whereby it might the better appear to the Commonwealth, that the said Lords States had commanded the said <HI>Trump</HI> nothing else then to ship about the Coasts and Havens of their Dominions, to shun all suspitions and Dissen∣tions; even so now again the same Lords Ambassadors assure the most Illustrious Councel, That by the Ordi∣nary Messenger they receive yesterday, they have re∣ceived all the Consultations handled by the said Lords States General from the 22<SUP>th</SUP> until the 29<SUP>th</SUP>, day of the last Moneth (new stile) on which the said Fight happen∣ned, whereby it appears yet more clear, and the said Lords Commissioners are more assured, that their Su∣periors gave at all no occasion, no cause nor counsel, but rather they did breathe (as it were) and further with the same minde, care and zeal, a more strict Friendship and mutual Alliance betwixt these two Nations, as it doth appear more clear then the sun at noon, by their said Lordships sentence on the occasion of an Answer to be sent to the Protestant <HI>Swissers,</HI> made on the 23<SUP>th</SUP> of the the said Moneth, a Copy whereof they now also pre∣sent and offer to the said most Illustrious Councel.</P>
<P>Therefore the said Lords Ambassadors intreat again this most ample Councel, That yielding due faith to so many Protestations, and to so many Testimonies, they would now upon their Demands with the Parlia∣ment (as is understood) communicated two days since, they would at the soonest give them such an Answer as the said Councel, according to their Wisdom and Justice may seem good and necessary, to prevent great∣er harm, and already imminent Dangers; And that
<PB N="37" REF="19"/>to these Evils a more ready Remedy may be applied, the same Lords Ambassadors would not have this Se∣nate ignorant, that the Lord <HI>Newport,</HI> sent by the Lords States to deliver to the Lords Ambassadors their Con∣sultations, and signifie to them besides their sincere and plain Minde, since it now seems things did happen otherwise and against their Hope and Trust, to think upon and prepare his Return, that so the better he might let them know in what state and condition mat∣ters now are, and what Remedy there may be applied; To which end the said Lords Ambassadors do intreat this Councel to give freedom and leave to the said Lord <HI>Newport,</HI> that he may choose some one of the Lords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tates General ships, now either in the <HI>Thames</HI> or in other parts of this Commonwealth, abiding for his Transportation, or by any other means may return home. Given at <HI>Chelsey,</HI> 6 <HI>June,</HI> 1652. <HI>stilo novo.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To the Councel of State of the Commonwealth of</HI> England;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Illustrious Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVen as both by vvord of mouth, and also by Wri∣ting, we have signified to this Councel on the third and sixth days of this moneth, taking God the searcher of Mans hearts to witness, that the most unhappy Fight of the ships of both Commonwealths did happen a∣gainst the knowledge and will of the Lords States Ge∣neral of the United Netherlands; so also are we daily more and more assured both by Messages and Letters, witnessing the most sincere hearts of our said Lords, and that with grief and astonishment they received the fatal
<PB N="39" REF="20"/>News of that unhappy rash Action; and that upon what we thereupon presently sent them word of, they did consult and endeavor to finde out what Remedy chiefly may be applied to mitigate that raw and bloody Wound: To which end, they have written out for to gather a solemn Meeting or Parliament of all the Pro∣vinces, whereby we do not doubt but there will be provided for these Troubles (by Gods favor) such a cure and present help, whereby not onely the outward cause of all further Evil may be taken away, but also by an Intern comfort the mindes may be redressed and re∣duced again to a better hope of our Treaty in hand; Which thing being now most earnestly agitated by our Lords for the common good of both Nations, to shun that detestable shedding of Christian blood (so much desired, and would be dearly bought by their common Enemies of both Nations, and of the Reformed Reli∣gion) we again do crave this most Honorable Councel, and beseech you, by the Pledges both of the common Religion and Liberty: mean while to suffer nothing to be done out of too much heat, that afterwards may prove neither revocable nor repairable by too late idle Vows and Wishes; but rather, that you would let us re∣ceive a kinde Answer without further delay upon our last Request.</P>
<P>Which we do again and again desire so much the more, because we understand, that the Ships of our Lords and of our Shippers both on the broad Sea, as in the Ports of this Commonwealth, some by force, some by fighting, are taken by your men and kept. Given at <HI>Chelsey</HI> 3/13 <HI>June,</HI> 1652.</P>
