<HEAD>The Preface TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately perused a little Book, called HIND's Ram∣ble, or a History of his pranks and Exploits, and finding ma∣ny of his Knaveries undiscovered, I thought good to publish to the World these ensuing Stories of him as a sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd part, to give Gen∣tlemen and Travellers direction to avoyd many dangers, which they may fall into: and to give you, as neer as I can, a more per∣fect character of him. This <HI>James Hinde</HI> was by his Country, <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> his former profession a Butcher, which, had he not been drawn away with ill company, might have maintained him in an honest
<PB REF="4"/>way: For Sleights and stratagems none can parallel him: he may be called a Ma∣ster in the Art of Theevery, as the cun∣ningest and wisest of the Company, for dif∣ficult and dangerous Thefts; he hath the Theory and Practique of the Art: He hath not his name for nought: for when mounted, he is as swift as a Hinde, as ra∣pacious as an Eagle, nothing comes amiss: and to palliate all these, he is a fine compa∣nion, facetious and witty: and to be short, he hath more tricks then a hundred of his fraternity: so much for his character.</P>
<P>And thus, courteous Reader, have I gi∣ven a true relation, in this various and plea∣sant History, of the wicked pollicies of HINDE and his Companions, that thou may be forewarned of unhappily falling into their dangers; also it may serve as a warn∣ing peece to those that are wickedly inclined, that they may be led from the Precipice of Perdition into the safe way of Vertue and Honesty.</P>

<HEAD>The second Discovery of <HI>HINDE's</HI> Exploits. BEING A full Relation of his Robberies, Cozenage, and Escapes.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>1 <HI>How</HI> Hinde <HI>being left alone, and most of his Crue disperst by a Hue and Cry, not having his own horse, and in distress for money, rob'd five Gentlemen as they were riding to a wedding; and how he was taken Prisoner.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HINDE</HI> having intelligence of a great Feast made by a Coun∣try
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>Gentleman, where were many Gentlemen to meet, who lived some four, or six, or ten miles off the place appointed, there being a wedding, or some such like occasion, takes his Horse in the morning, and coasting the Country, meets with a Gentle∣man and his man riding towards the foresaid House, bids them <HI>Stand,</HI> and without much dispute the Gen∣tleman delivers him 20. pounds in Gold, thinking it better to <HI>scape with a whole skin, then lose his mony, and be beaten to boot.</HI> By that time they were parted comes to his view an an∣cient Penifather, with his only heir, who one would not have thought would have parted with their money so quietly: <HI>Hinde</HI> knowing 'twas no time for him to dally, bids them <HI>Stand,</HI> sets his pistol to the brest of the young gallant; the old man be∣ing struck with a pannick fear, cries out, <HI>Save his life, and take his money,</HI> which was quickly done, together
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>with his Sword; and then it came to the old mans turn to deliver, <HI>who was as ready to give as he to ask:</HI> their pockets being both emptied, <HI>Hinde</HI> threw the young gallant his Sword again, and bad him <HI>learn to make bet∣ter use of it, and draw it as occasion was offered.</HI> But the old man, willing to save the credit of his son, resolved to make no words of it, and the gen∣tleman before (being robbed) had taken the same resolution also, that the Ladies should not laugh at their hard fortune. <HI>Hinde</HI> immediately taking another rode, meets another Gentleman riding to the same house, and he resolving to make his fore∣noons work worth his labour, bids him <HI>Stand,</HI> the Gentleman drew, <HI>Hinde</HI> shewed him his pistol; <HI>You may thank that for your prize</HI> (quoth the Gentleman,) <HI>your sword should not have won my mony.</HI> At which gal∣lantry <HI>Hinde</HI> was well pleased, and gave him five of his fifteen peeces
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>back again. By this time <HI>Hinde</HI> thought his mornings work was over, it growing towards dinner time in∣tended to march towards his Com∣radoes, who were disperst by a Hue and Cry, which followed them three days before for another Robbery: and having <HI>not his own horse under him,</HI> thought it not best to stay too long thereabouts: Having no sooner taken this resolution, but he spies an∣other young Gentleman (supposed to be a younger Brother) upon a good Gelding riding that way; <HI>Hind</HI> being full of confidence, resolved to take his Mony and be gone, bids him <HI>Stand,</HI> at which word the Gentle∣man dismounts, and draws his sword; quoth <HI>Hinde, Shall I be troubled more with thee, than all that be gone before? Since thou art so gallant, thou shalt have fair play for thy Money:</HI> puts up his pistol, dismounts also, and draws his sword; and having made a close or two, neither being wounded, <HI>Hind</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>would as willingly have been rid of his Gamester, as the Gentleman would have been of him; But ere they could agree on the matter, came riding an old Gentleman with a sur∣ly Serving-man, who knew the en∣gaged Gentleman, and was quickly off his Horse with his sword drawn; Quoth <HI>Hinde, We are two fair game∣sters, we need no third man:</HI> Yes al∣ways, quoth the Serving-man, <HI>at in and in, which I suppose is your sport;</HI> With that the Gentleman made a close with <HI>Hinde,</HI> and quickly the Serving-man had his hand in <HI>Hinde</HI>'s pocket, but drew forth nought but his pistol, at which <HI>Hinde</HI> yeelded himself Prisoner.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>2 <HI>How</HI> Hinde, <HI>after he was taken pri∣soner by the last Gentleman and Ser∣ving-man, was carried to Dinner with them, where he met with all those he had robbed that morning; and after much pleasant discourse, gave them the slip with a good geld∣ing worth</HI> 50 <HI>pounds.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HInde</HI> being taken prisoner by the young Gentleman and Ser∣ving man, thought it good to go quietly with them, that so be might be the better able to make an escape when he saw occasion; and said, <HI>Sir, I am now your prisoner, pray let me know whither you are riding;</HI> Quoth he, but to a Gentlemans house about two miles off, to dine with some friends, whither I intend you shall march; Quoth <HI>Hinde, I beleeve there be some gentlemen gone before will be glad to see me.</HI> You shall be civilly used, quoth the Gentleman,
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>and dine with us, and then shall I deliver you to the Justice. They being come to the house, Dinner being set, the Master of the House saluted <HI>Hinde,</HI> and bad him welcom, as the young Gentlemans friend, and caused him to sit down at Table; <HI>Hinde</HI> takes a glass of wine in his hand, and drinks to all the Company, especially to those of his acquaint∣ance (as he called them) whom he had robbed in the morning. Quoth the old Penifather, <HI>Couldst thou not be content with so good a breakfast, but must thou come and affront my son and me at Dinner?</HI> At which words the whole business was understood, and the one said, he was robbed of so much, and another of so much, and all acknowledged what they had lost. <HI>I thank ye all Gentlemen,</HI> quoth Hinde, <HI>for my breakfast; but I am most engaged to this Gentleman, for he would not let me pass till he brought me to a plentiful Dinner.</HI> Much mirth
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>past at the Table, and <HI>Hinde</HI> fitted them with very good discourse for the day; That pleased the company so well, that each man endevored to shew him what favor they could; so that after Dinner they took him out into the Court, where the Ma∣ster of the House had a gallant yong Gelding, never backt before that day, which was very unruly, and had thrown two or three Riders; quoth <HI>Hinde,</HI> if it please you Gentlemen to give me leave, <HI>I shall bring this Gelding to a pace in a quarter of an hour;</HI> There being a high wall round the yard, none mistrusted his inten∣tion; he mounts the Gelding with the Masters leave, and was commend∣ed by all the Gentlemen for a very good horseman; having sufficiently chafed and madded the mettalsom Beast, and spying a little broken place in the wall, with a full carier leapt the gelding over, and turning about, said, <HI>I thank you all Gentlemen for my
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>Breakfast and Dinner, but I must sup above forty miles off this night.</HI> So the Clark lost his labor in making his <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and his Master a Gelding worth fifty pounds.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>3 <HI>How</HI> Hinde <HI>cozened an Inn-Keeper, by pretending himself to be some great Lord, to the value of threescore pounds.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere is no game comes amiss, but <HI>Hinde</HI> hath skill in it; in his low Estate he hath his conceits, and now he is a pretended Lord, here we shal shew you how he sends some of his Comradoes in the habit of Serving-men to take up a Lodging for their Master in an Inn, telling that he was a great Lord, and was desirous to lie there about some busi∣ness; but withall they told him he must have extraordinary fare, as Rab∣bits and Chickens, and all other dainties, no Butchers meat would
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>go down with him; and to colour the business, he sent him two great iron bound chests, with strong locks, and mailed with cords, and gave or∣der they should be put in the best room in the House, as if there had been some rich business in it; So when the Lodging was fitted, the next day comes in <HI>Hinde</HI> like a great Lord, or <HI>Don of Spain,</HI> and was welcomed by the Host with a great deal of respect and honor; nothing was omitted that might any way give him content: And thus he continu∣ed for some certain time; for he went out upon his Robbery, and came in again in his Coach, and none suspected or mistrusted; and when he thought he had layn there long e∣nough, for fear of discovery he took an occasion to borrow threescore pounds of his Host, pretending some extraordinary business; the credu∣lous Host beleeves him, and lends it him, he having (as he thought) such
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>good security; But (the Bird being now flegged, it is time to take wing and be gone,) <HI>Hinde</HI> goes out in the morning in his Coach, but was too wise to come any more there: he is expected at night, but no Lord comes, his Lordship was gone another pro∣gress; he stays a week, and appears not; a Moneth expires, and he is not seen: At last the Host begins to be jealous, and mistrusts, That <HI>all is not gold that glisters;</HI> He now begins to think, there's some Knave∣ry; and (to be short) calls a Con∣stable, and he sits ready to take an Inventory of the goods in the chests; The two great Chests are unmailed, or uncorded, the Locks are broken open; which being done, alass then his grief appears; For in stead of rich treasure, he finds nothing but two Chests full of stones and old rubbish cram'd together.</P>

<HEAD>4 <HI>How</HI> Hinde <HI>cozened a Merchant in</HI> Holland <HI>of</HI> 300 <HI>Crowns, by giv∣ing a counterfeit chain for a pledg.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis jovial Gamester, <HI>Hinde,</HI> being in <HI>Holland,</HI> having spent his Mony, casts his wits about how to recrute himself; and you know good workmen never want their tools: You may remember I told you how he served the Inn-Keeper, just almost in the same manner he beguiles the Dutchman; He goes af∣ter the fashion of a Gallant, the better to set a gloss upon his Knave∣ry; he hath his man to wait upon him; and by his gallant garb insinu∣ates into a rich Merchants acquaint∣ance; makes the World beleeve he hath brought the wealth of the <HI>Indies</HI> with him; he pretends he hath great wealth, and happy were he that could be acquainted with him, for it is the nature of the Dutchmen to strike
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>sail for their own profit, to offer any Kindness where they perceive they may be any way a gainer: Amongst the rest, a Merchant of no mean qua∣lity perceiving his deportment, in∣vites him to his house; this gudgeon with little entreaty quickly swallows the bait, and accepts his proffer; when come to his House the Mer∣chant entertains him with a great deal of civility; <HI>Hinde</HI> pretends to send one of his men to his two chests, which were aboard of a ship in the Key, for some Money, which made the Merchant say, <HI>Sir, I much wonder you being a stranger dare trust your wealth in such a place; if you please sir, my house shall be at your pleasure.</HI> But <HI>Hinde</HI> takes an occasion upon dis∣course to pull out of a Box a Chain of pure gold before the Merchant, which he much admiring, said, <HI>Sir, you need not want Money so long as you have this to engage. Hinde</HI> replyed, I should be loath to engage it but up∣on
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>on necessity, which I am now driven to; For although I have Money, yet I cannot command it, because I must pay it presently upon a Bill of ex∣change: <HI>Sir,</HI> replyed the Merchant, <HI>I shall befriend you so far as to lend you so much money as you have occasion for:</HI> Which proffer <HI>Hinde</HI> as modestly denyed, yet with a kinde of willing unwillingness he kindly accepted his courtesie, and presently called for his man to take the Chain, and see what the Goldsmith would value it at, and to bring a Test under his hand. The Merchant as seeming unwilling to receive his Chain as a pledg, replyed, <HI>Good Sir do not trouble your self so, I dare take your word for more then this sum;</HI> (yet his fingers itcht to be fin∣gering of this pawn;) <HI>Hinde</HI> the more puts it upon him, seeing his un∣willingness to receive it;) <HI>Well Sir,</HI> saith the Merchant, <HI>seeing it is your pleasure, my man shall go with your ser∣vant to see the value of it at the Gold∣smiths.
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>Hinde</HI> calls his man, deli∣vers him the Chain, and together they go, and bring a Test under the Goldsmiths hand, who finds it right and rich. Now <HI>Hinde</HI> had playd his game so, that he had provided his man with another Chain of brass gilded, of the same weight to a grain, that you could not know the one from the other; and coming home, delivers the brass Chain and Ticket to <HI>Hinde; Hinde</HI> delivers them to the Merchant, he looks upon it, finds it (to his thinking) the same, sees no∣thing to the contrary: So <HI>Hinde</HI> re∣ceives his 300 Crowns, and when they had dined and talked, <HI>Hinde</HI> and his man took their leaves for the pre∣sent, as pretending to go about bu∣siness, but never returned to redeem his Chain, but left the Merchant to repent him of his dear bought pur∣chase.</P>

<P>WHen <HI>Hinde</HI> was in his pro∣gress in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he would sometimes scout out, and lurk about for a prey, with the rest of his Com∣radoes, and by chance he met two or three Tories, who had got a prize of Money and Plunder, and were re∣turning to their Fastues, or Quarters, but they had not so good luck with it as they expected, for <HI>Hinde</HI> and his Myrmidons fall in to them, and make them believe they were of their profession, as indeed they were, but in another way; but one of the To∣ries had a jealous minde that <HI>Hinde</HI> was not a true Brother, whereupon he asked him what he was: <HI>What am I,</HI> quoth <HI>Hinde? A Brother of the Blade, and that thou shalt know before we part; therefore deliver, or beleeve
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>it, this sword shall speak other language then you expect.</HI> The Gentlemen were much amazed at this unexpected an∣swer; They asked him, what he meant? <HI>What do I mean? I mean to try a touch whether or no that Mony you have shall be yours or ours;</HI> and to't they went; but <HI>Hinde</HI> so playd his game that he made them be glad to be rid of him upon such conditions as he liked, and they disliked, which was, to leave their Mony behinde them, and go home by the weeping cross, and cry, <HI>O hone, O hone!</HI></P>

<PB N="22" REF="15"/>to meet with you, I live not far from this place, if you please to go along with me to my house, I have a wife much troubled with a Flux in her belly for these fourteen days, and you by your ex∣perience may do her much good, if you please to give her a visit; I humbly re∣quest you to go along with me, and what content you desire, I shall willingly sa∣tisfie.</HI> This Bell sounded well in his ears: well, he goes with <HI>Hinde</HI> to his lodging, and in the way he gives <HI>Hinde</HI> comfortable answer, saying, <HI>God forbid I should neglect that little skill I have to do your wife any good I can:</HI> Upon these Complements <HI>Hinde</HI> leads him from one street to another, till at last he got him within his lodging, which was so contrived, that it was some distance from other houses; having lock'd the door upon him, he takes in one hand a Pistol, in the other a great empty purse, and fu∣riously looking upon the Mounte∣bank, he said, <HI>Sir, here is my wife,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>(meaning the empty Purse,) <HI>she hath been a long time troubled with a Flux in her belly, and you are the onely man that can onely remedy and finde out a means to cure this disease; else I my self, by the help of this pistol, am resol∣ved to remedy it.</HI> This Mountebank seeing himself thus cunningly and suddenly surprized, began suddenly to cry out, but was presently silencd by the sight of the pistol, was fain for fear to let go his own purse to cure that purse which had the flux; but according to his wonted charity, seeing the man in this trembling con∣dition, he restored him some part of his Money again, promised to con∣vey him to his Lodging, and did with his pistol cockd, for fear of an out∣cry, and in the mid way left him and his lodging both together.</P>
