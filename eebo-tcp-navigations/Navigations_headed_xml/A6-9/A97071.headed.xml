<OPENER><SALUTE>Loving Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING received information from you of the passages in Eng∣land, I have thought it necessary to give you by this bearer (a friend of mine) notice of our occurrences and proceedings of late in this Kingdome.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P>On the 22. of September the great Rebel Oneal came before Munster with neer 15000. men, threatning ruine and destruction to all that should any way resist them, pretending withall, that he had the Kings authority for what he did: but I conceive that is but a coun∣terfeit shew and false pretence, where∣with he beguiled the ignorant Irish, ta∣king example, as I conceive, of the ma∣lignants of your Kingdome, who co∣lour all their vvicked and malicious de∣signes under a pretence of standing for His Majesty, and the defence of the true Protestant Religion, when indeed their ends are like his, tending to nothing but ruine and destruction.</P>
<P>But we, being well acquainted with his trecherous actions, and knowing that our chief security consisted in Gods protection and our own timely preven∣tion, gathered our selves together under the command of our Vice-President: and though we were but a small num∣ber in comparison of his forces, yet be∣ing
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>put into a martial equipage, we fron∣ted boldly, without demanding the cause of his present arrivall.</P>
<P>This sudden and unexpected charge proved very advantagious to us, and dis∣advantagious to them: for instead of making good their ground, they lost their order, which by the continuall motion and striving of the grosse body, was rather more disordered, then any way recovered, by which meanes our men did very great execution upon the army of the Rebels, routing and scat∣tering their maine Batalia, our Troupes of Horse falling upon their flanks, and trampling the Irish Kernes like morter upon the ground: it was a kinde of delight to us to heare the musicke that was made betwixt the Drums &amp; Trum∣pets, our shouts, and their acclamations, which were much shriller then the Trumpets, and indeed were heard lou∣der then any part of the consort. To be short, we slew above two hundred of the Rebels forces, and wee lost not
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>above twenty five: only some that were wounded in the pursuit with their wea∣pons which were scattered upon the ground, especially pikes, and some skenes, which we reserved; onely the pikes, by reason that wee wanted wag∣gons, wee were commanded to burne them, to the end that they might bee made unfit to be imployd in any service against us. Philomy Oneale was in such haste to escape, that he took up his lodg∣ing that night in the woods, &amp; the next day stole away disguised in the habit of a common souldier. Our Province is cleered neer thirty miles round about.</P>
<P>I received information from the har∣bor of Gallway, that the English ships imployed by the Parliament of England have lately had in chase certain Spanish Frigots, laden with ammunition, which were intended to be landed for the ser∣vice of the Rebels, but being prevented and closely chased by the English ships, they strucke into a Creeke some three miles from Galway, which goes from
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>the Ocean up to Munster, but being un∣acquainted with the turnings of the channell, and running with a stiffe fore∣right wind, they struck upon a shelve, and stuck fast, so that before they could get their Ordnance ashore to guard their fraught, they were close set upon by the English, which were put on shore from the ships in long boats, and they with their rich fraught were seized on to bee imployed against the Rebels.</P>
<P>The Scottish Forces under the com∣mand of Colonell Lesley have behaved themselves very nobly, and oftentimes put the rebels to the worst, having taken many Castles, and other places of great eminency.</P>
<P>Our Commanders play false play, and leave us: My Lord Grandison hath left his Troupe to the wide world, Captain Bartlet hath forsaken us, and Captaine Gibson, with many others. Other our Officers that are resident with us, play least in sight: they have got into strong holds, and doe nothing, but suffer the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>Rebels to come up to the very walls of Dublin, doing spoile, robbing and plun∣dering the inhabitants without contra∣diction: Likewise they pretend, that they are commanded to desist, but by what authority, they denie to make knowne: but wee have great cause to feare that they are popishly affected, and by their practises do further the commo∣tions in England. If we had but some present supply, we doubt not but to re∣cover our pristine liberty; but if things continue at this stay, we are all destined to ruine, and the Kingdome must of ne∣cessitie be utterly lost. I pray remember our distressed estate in your prayers, and according to your opportunity let me heare what passes in England. So in hast I rest,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your loving brother, J. WALSGRAVE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
