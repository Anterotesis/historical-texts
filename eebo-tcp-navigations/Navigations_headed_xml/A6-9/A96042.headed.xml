<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce my last of the 12th. instant, We have had ano∣ther engagement with the Hollander, which was disputed with sundry fiery arguments, and maintai∣ned with great gallantry on both sides; for, indeed they are a very stout enemy, and fight with great courage and magnanimity of Spirit, and as their ships are of a great Bulk and Burthen, so are they also well man'd; their Mus∣quetiers man the Decks with unresistable courage, not∣withstanding
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>the bullets flying as thick as hail (a compa∣rison by way of simile) their Captains are excellent Na∣vigators, and seem to infuse a second nature into the Ma∣riners, before an assault be given, the better to inable them to withstand a storm, that is; before they begin to sight, it is their usuall custome, to give each one three cups of Brandy wine, viz. strong-water, to encourage them, which makes them as valiant as so many Hectors; but the Cap∣tains prove not right Alchymists at all times; for that which they last administred to the poor Sea-men, took not its full operation, but rather struck a spirit of Cow∣ardize in them, as appears; Captain Peacock, Command∣er of the Tyger, having received orders from Gen. Blake, to scout forth, for making a discovery of Vantrump, met with five Dutchmen, who hailing them, and commanding them to strike sail, they refused; so great is their impe∣riousnesse: whereupon he gave them one gun with a round ball, they answered in the like nature with three; insomuch that a bloudy fight began, and for the space of four hours a hot dispute was with great gallantry performed on both sides; till at last it pleased the divine power, to make the English victorious, by finking one, and taking three, but not without losse, yet not so great as was supposed; for the truth is, our General much feared, that he had been either sunk or taken, by reason that he was missing three days; but upon the fourth day he returned with triumph, and brought in three Dutch prizes with him; we have taken in all about 44 sail, yet many there are that stick not to say, that Vantrump hath given the Eng∣lish a great overthrow, which maketh the Scots to re∣joyce exceedingly, and say, that Common-wealths folks must not reign always; neither must the Common∣wealth of England trample over the whole world, <HI>hut a∣way hut,</HI> quoth the Scot, they misken themselves; Alas!
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>they are grosly mistaken it is not apparent, that we know them better now, then ever, and have made a further progresse into that barren Countrey, then in any Kings reign formerly; But I will pass them by, and proceed a∣gain to Vantrump (the Dutch Lyon as the Flemings call him) who hath set forth a Declaration abroad the Navy, published by sound of Trumpet, that what Cap∣tain, or Officer whatsoever, that shall strike sail to the English, shall die without mercy; so great is his imperi∣ousness and malice, that he endeavours nothing more then to beget a war betwixt the two States; he lies now hovering about the Coast of France, and gives out, that he will have the other bout, although it be with the price of his bloud, which may soon be; for the Gene∣rall is resolved to weigh anchor with 60 sail, to find him out, and fight him: Sir George Ayscue is come up to our Fleet, from Plymouth, who saluted Gene∣rall Blake, with discharging his guns our whole Fleet an∣swered him again with the like salutation; both Fleets being joyned sudden action is expected, we hear that sixe fire-ships are comming to us, and twenty more men of war, which will make us about one hundred sail; Col∣lonel Goffs Regiment of foot, and Collonel Ingolds∣bies are come aboard, and seem very unanimous, ha∣ving protested to live and die with our Seamen.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Ireland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu may perceive by the Articles of Kilkenny; that all the Rebels in the several Provinces had time pre∣fixed them for the accepting of those conditions if they pleased, but Clanrickard and his party in Connaught, Grace, and his party in the Kings and Queens County, Collonel Phelim Birne and his party in Wexford and Wicklow, and Sir Phelim O Neal, with the O Relies, Mac Mahon, &amp;c. in Ulster, have wholly declared against the acceptance of the Articles; in order to which, the Lord of Clanrickard, with the Connaught Forces mar∣ched to Ballishanon about May 16, drew some Ordnance from Sligo, and battered two days, made abreach, and stormed it, but was twice beaten of with cōsiderable loss, yet at length carried it. From thence he marched, and took Dongal Castle, and the Ulster Forces joyned with him. This intelligence came to us the second instant, and brought us also assurance, that the Lord President with the Connaught and Athlone forces marched to Ballisha∣non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n prosecution of the Lord Clanrickard, and was there about the 24 of May. That Col. Venables with the Ulster forces lay about Omagh, the Commissary General marched towards Venables the 24 of May, with about 300 horse to strengthen his party, and that the Legan men, headed by Col. Sanderson, had taken the passages upon Barns-moore to stop Clanrickards passage into Ra∣pha. So that you see, all the care and vigilancy possible is taken to prevent Clanrickards return, and to fight him
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>with the Ulster men in the north, where I hope God hath brought them to judge and avenge upon them the inno∣cent blood that was first shed in that Province. I doubt not, but by this time our forces are near an engagement with the Rebels, or that it is already done, and if so, I am consident you will hear of it as soon as we where we now lie. As for Grace, whose force consisted of about 1200 foot, and 400 horse, they have been (of late) so hunted from place to place by Col. Sankey on the one side, and Col. Axtel on the other side, that to save themselves they were forced to disperse, and some of his Officers (as well horse as foot) have come in, and submitted and delivered up their arms. We hear also that Westmeath, Slane, Dungan, Scurlogh, and others have laid down their arms in Lemster, of which I am sure you have a more particu∣lar information then we have.</P>
<P>It remains now that I give you the knowledge concer∣ning the actings of the Lord Muskerry, which hath been transacted by the Commissioners at Clonmel. He sent the Commissioners an absolute rejection of the Articles of Kilkenny, desiring to have a Treaty entertained with himself. The Messenger that brought this, was Captain David Power of Kilholme, a man subtil enough to avoid the danger he sell into, but that God that commonly takes the wise in their own craftiness, led the Commissioners to enquire why a man of his quality should be imployed about so fruitless an errant. Whereupon further search being made, they found about him and his servant, some Letters to the Enemy of dangerous consequence, and al∣so cyphers, and other papers, which his safe conduct would not bear him out in, upon which he was commit∣ted in order to his further trial, and an intimation of all was sent to his Lord, the Lord Muskerry. After this, see∣ing a further Treaty would not be granted him, he sent a∣nother
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>Messenger, intimating, that if he might himself have assurance for life, he would submit with his party to the Parliaments mercy, and render the strong hold of Rosse again into the Parl hand, with his other strengths. This message came from him on Sunday last, when the Lievt. Gen. was prepared to march into Kerry the Tues∣day following, with a party of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 foot, and 800 horse to reduce that County to the Parliaments obedience. Upon due debate and consideration, it was advised to send the Lord Muskerry a safe guard for life (and accordingly acted) onely upon the condition aforesaid. Upon Wed∣nesday in the evening his messenger returned, and assured us that his Lordship was still constant to his first resolu∣tion, but that several of his party had deserted him, be∣cause their lives were not secured as well as his, and that if the Lievt. Gen. marched up to him he would deliver Ross into his hands. This answer come to the Lievt. Gen. ve∣sterday morning, whowe beleeve was then within 12 miles of the place, what the issue is we know not, but when we receive it you shall know it the first opportunity.</P>
