And that the severall Treasurers appoint∣ed by the Committee, and Sub-Committees of Accompts in any County, to receive the Arrears due upon Accompts within the said County, shall have power and authority by vertue of this present Ordinance to receive all Arrears, discovered, and found by them to be due upon any Accompt taken by them in those respective Counties, notwithstanding any former Ordi∣nance, or Ordinances to the contrary. And the said Chamberlaine of <HI>London,</HI> and the said Trea∣surers, shall from time to time out of the said Arrears pay unto the severall Officers, and

<P>And that in case the Arreares due upon Ac∣compts payable to the Chamberlaine of <HI>London,</HI> shall not be sufficient to defray the said Salaries and necessary incident charges of the Officers of the Committee for taking the Accompts of the whole Kingdome; That then the fifteene hun∣dred pounds formerly appointed to be paid unto them out of the Excise, by an Ordinance of the fifth day of June last past, shall be paid to them accordingly, otherwise the said Ordinance for the said fifteen hundred pounds shall be void and null.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P> Provided that the severall summes of money to be issued out for the payment of the Salaries of the Officers of the Committee and Sub-Com∣mittees for taking the Accompts and the incident Charges aforesaid, shall be from time to time is∣sued out by the said Chamberlaine of London, and the severall respective Treasurers aforesaid, by Warrant under the hands of the Committee for taking the Accompts of the whole Kingdom, or any five of them, to such person or persons as shall be comprised in the said Warrants; And that the said Warrant or Warrants, together with the Acquittances of the said person or per∣sons therein comprised, shall be a sufficient dis∣charge unto the said Chamberlaine and Treasu∣rers for the severall summes so issued.</P>
