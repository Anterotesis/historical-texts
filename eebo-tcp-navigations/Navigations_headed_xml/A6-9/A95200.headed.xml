<HEAD>A true Relation of my Lord of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Encounter.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Rince ROBERT being landed at <HI>Dover,</HI> and having fully re∣covered his health (which he lost by a fall from his horse) made haste unto his Majesty, where hee was so courteously entertaind, being made Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, that it gave him great encourage∣ment for to attempt any enterprize were it never so dangerous, many malitious practices he used upon the Northern parts, especially <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> but my Lord of <HI>Stamford</HI> having intelli∣gence that hee had seizd upon <HI>Harborow</HI> a small, yet well fortified Towne, in those
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>went both Horse and foote to the num∣ber of 600 to meet him, marching to∣wards the said place and to Prevent his further wicked intentions thought to have seased vpon some of his Cava∣leers, but the Prince his forces were two for one, being in all about the numbe of 1300 horse besids certaine small quantity of foote which my Lord hearing tooke it to Consideration whether it were for their safety to march forward or no and as∣king the advice of the <HI>Commanders,</HI> put∣ting the question to the Generall vote of the soudiers, who with and unannimous consent were more willing to goe for∣ward then retire, so that my Lord vnder God still went on, beinge within a small distance of the Citty, intellegence was brought his Lordship that the prince his Cavaleers had ransaked the towne took<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> way all their goods, fired many of the houses, malitiously trampld downe and beaten down all their C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne, to the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> prejudice and dammage of the whole coun∣trey,
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>that they intended to returne thither againe to take possession of the place very sodenly, all which my lord hearing gaue strict charge to the Cheefe men of the Towne by no meanes to let them haue en∣trance, which they did, for when the Prince came with his forces the Town stood vp in armes to resist him in the in∣terim my lord of <HI>Stamford</HI> wheeld about him with his forces and so invirond him round, that the prince with most of his followers were faine to take water and swim over a great River for the safety of their liues, wherein the cavaleers suffered and were drownded, some my lord tooke prisners, whom hee sent vnder a safe guard to be conducted to London where as yet they remaine.</P>
<P>Thus hath the Parliaments party ob∣tained the day, and won the victory over the Welch Cavaleers, which I beleeve di∣vers of their Country men will take war∣ning by them, and learn how to keep with∣in their own bounds and liberties.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>Newes is brought over that <HI>Oneale,</HI> Ge∣nerall of the Irish Rebels, had bribed cer∣taine poor Protestants to set on fire <HI>Dub∣lin,</HI> the Metropolitane Towne of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that hee himselfe went thither dis∣guised, with some others to be assistants in the same, but his treachery was prevented and divulged by the said Protestants, who at their examination confessed the same, which thing <HI>Oneal</HI> having intelligence of, privately hastned to his fellow Souldiers.</P>
<P>Likewise joyfull Newes is brought o∣ver, that the Rebels are brought to such a straight, that they must very shortly yeeld or perish, and they would come to com∣position upon reasonable conditions, of which these are the chiefe.</P>
<P><HI>First, That every man should have that freedome and scope, as to be of that Religion, as best agrees to his owne particular conscience (alledging that King</HI> James <HI>did allow of the same, and that our King</HI> Charles <HI>did not gaine say it.)</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P><HI>Secondly, that the Parliament here in England should not proceed over severe against their ancient Romane Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, that they should not be lyable to pay any taxation whatsoever, whether for their Religion, or any temporary accident, but onely what voluntarily they condescend unto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly, that certaine Lawes should be established and enacted according to their wills, and to be obeyed and kept by none but their Sexaries, namely that none should be compelled to keep them but they themselves, not excepting others that voluntarily would.</HI></P>
<P>But tis to be noted, that these Articles were not by the universall consent of all the Rebels propounded, for many of them were more resolutely bent to dye in the defence of their Faith; but by some cer∣taine of them that were pend up in a nook by our men, so that they could hardly scape away.</P>
<P>Much malicious and wicked tyranny doe the Rebels use towards many of our men whom they take prisoners, cutting
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>out the tongues of some, scaring the mem∣bers of others, and most inhumanely stran∣gling divers by dozens in halters; there∣fore I thinke it were not much amisse to give them <HI>Lex Talionis,</HI> and use them with the like severity here in <HI>England,</HI> since their malicious proceedings is such against our Brethren in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Certain joyfull Newes is brought of my Lord of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Encounter with 2. French ships, who after a long chase he took pri∣soners, and received from them great store of Ammunition, sufficient for 300 men, be∣sides the store of field pieces, all which was thought was intended for His Majesties assistance against the Honourable Houses of Parliament. Likewise there were great store of Muskets and Pistols in the said ships, being hid in false Cabines, which by a diligent search were all found out and sent by his Lordships command to <HI>Northampton</HI> to my Lord of <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
