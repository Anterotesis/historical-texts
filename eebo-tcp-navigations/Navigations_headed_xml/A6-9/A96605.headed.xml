<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat which enduced me to present your <HI>EXCELLENCY</HI> with this short Narra∣tive of my Services, Sufferings, and Dis∣bursements for this Nation, proceedeth nei∣ther from the vanity to magnifie my owne actions (being hardly worth the mentioning before your <HI>Ex∣cellency</HI>) Nor from any pressing necessity of your pitty; or a present desire to be re-imbursed, though I do very much need both your compassion &amp; assistance: but the same principles of Reason, Honour, and Justice, (that obliged my primitive en∣gagement with the first for this Nation in generall, for de∣fence of its Lawes and Liberties) calling upon me to make some sure provision, that after my long and faithfull service, travells and endeavours for the publique Weale, I my selfe might not lye under a causelesse calumny, doth necessitate this my humble application to your <HI>Excellency,</HI> to the end that (my cause being fully knowne) I might not be rendered un∣capable of an owning from your <HI>Excellency,</HI> and all good men that have acted though in a higher station) on the same account.</P>

<HEAD>The Affection, Services, Sufferings, and Ex∣pences of C. <HI>Reeve Williams</HI> for the preservation of the English interest, on behalf of the Parl. and Army from the beginning of the Warre to this present. Tendered unto the serious consideration of his Excellencie The LORD GENERALL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Eing convinced in his understanding of the justnesse of the Parliaments cause in opposition to the King and his adherents, and desiring to manifest his affection thereunto. In <HI>Anno</HI> 1641. he at his owne charge fitted a Ship at <HI>Dover</HI> to be imployed in the ser∣vice of the State against the Irish; but when he had ex∣pended a very great part of his estate therein, Imprest was denyed him, and he being a stranger in those parts, and not able to beare the whole charge) was forced to re∣turne with the said Ship to <HI>Wales,</HI> there to Winter, and remaine untill Providence should offer an opportunity of his being serviceable to the State, which fell according to his expectation; for immediatly after the Battle at <HI>Edge∣hill,</HI> the late King sent one Col: <HI>Donell</HI> to <HI>Swansey</HI> to seize upon the said Ship, and in her to import Armes and Am∣munition from <HI>France;</HI> but Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> having no∣tice thereof, took his opportunity and set sayle with the said Ship to <HI>Plimouth</HI> immediately; for which he was proclaimed a Traytor to the King. But being safely ar∣rived, and having supplyed the Town with some provisi∣ons, he took a Commission from the Earle of <HI>Stamford</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>then Generall of the West of <HI>England;</HI> and hearing the County of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was much straitned, and in apparent danger of being lost to the enemy, the well-affected be∣ing almost quite dismay'd, having very few friends, many irreconcileable enemies, and no one Ship of force belong∣ing to the Parliament in their Harbour to support them, he set sayle to <HI>Milford haven:</HI> At whose arrivall, the Par∣liaments friends were much encouraged to defend them∣selves against the enemy, who were preparing to come a∣gainst them; and the enemy no lesse discouraged and de∣ferred. From thence he steered to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to Admirall <HI>Swanley,</HI> to whom he discovered the necessity of the Par∣liaments friends in <HI>Pembrokeshire,</HI> with the advantage that might accrue to the Parl. interest, if he would with any of his Ships of War but appeare to countenance and en∣courage them. Whereupon Admirall <HI>Swanley</HI> being seri∣ously affected therewith, sent Vice-Admirall <HI>Smith</HI> with Capt. <HI>Williams</HI> to <HI>Milford,</HI> where arriving they found two men of Warre of the Kings riding in the Harbour, &amp; threatning fire and sword to the Country, if they did not relinquish the Parl. interest, and adhere to the Kings; both which were taken, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Fellowship</HI> by Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> and the <HI>Hart</HI> Frigot by Capt: <HI>Williams,</HI> after 24. houres fight, to the great hazard of his own Ship.</P>
<P>Soone after he reduced the Town of <HI>Tinby</HI> to the obe∣dience of the Parl. and obliged them to receive a Garri∣son from Maj: Gen: <HI>Laughorne,</HI> although the town at that time had onely Capt: <HI>Wyat</HI> and Capt: <HI>Gibs</HI> and their rela∣tions that were in the said Town, friends to the Parl.</P>
<P>All which services, expences and hazards were by him performed upon the single score of Affection, he having received no assurance of pay or satisfaction from the Par. that might or did in any measure induce him thereto.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<P>Neither rested he there; but with his Prize taken as a∣foresaid, sayled to the Downes, where appearing to the Admirall and his service by Vice-Admirall <HI>Smith</HI> to him manifested, the same was represented to the Parliament, to whose Officers he had delivered his Prize at <HI>Chattam,</HI> with all her stores and tackle unimbezel'd, for which he received a publique owning from the Parliament, and was with his Ship entertained in the publique service; and in a short time was instrumentall in the bringing in many rich Prizes, which were disposed for the service of the Parl.</P>
<P>The next yeare having with the Parl. Commission put to Sea for his owne account, he was taken by three of the French Kings Men of War and carryed into <HI>Brest,</HI> where his Ship was sold, and he himselfe after many hardships and hazards escaped with life to <HI>England,</HI> by which he was damnified in his estate, as is proved in the Admiralty, above 6000. l. all which losses and hazards he sustained for no other cause but his constant adherence to, and ad∣vancement of the interest of Parl. from whom as a reward and encouragement he received a promise of reparation.</P>
<P>Being disabled in his estate as aforesaid, he resolved ne∣verthelesse to engage againe according to his ability: In order to which, with the assistance of some friends, he built a Frigot with 32. Oares, with which he re-took the Scout Frigot formerly lost, sunk the Frigot called <HI>The Cavalier of Bristoll,</HI> that infested the Western coast, espe∣cially <HI>Weymouth;</HI> also a Frigot of S. <HI>Mallowes,</HI> which con∣tinually supplyed the Kings party with Arms and Am∣munition.</P>
<P>After which, and severall other services done for the Publique, he returned to <HI>London;</HI> where residing some small time, and finding the power of the enemy at Sea increasing, he againe cast himselfe upon Providence, and
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>with three Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the Mermaid, the Warspite, and the Increase, fitted, victualled, and mann'd upon his own accompt he set out to Sea; and being outward bound in <HI>Bolloign</HI> Roade, he tooke the <HI>Charles</HI> Frigot belonging to Sir <HI>Nicholas Crispe,</HI> which had long infested the Coast of <HI>Kent,</HI> and done much mischiefe to the Parlia∣ments friends; which Frigot was also added to his Squa∣dron, and a Commission obtained for her; soon after, ranging in the Chanell he took the Princes Dogger∣Boat, a vessell of eight Gunns, laden with provisions for <HI>Pendennis</HI> fort, and a packquet directed to Sir <HI>Nicho∣las Crispe;</HI> which being transmitted to the State, he steered toward the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well to prevent supplyes consigned to the Irish from other Nations, as to make his purchase upon them. Where arriving, on the South West part of <HI>Munster</HI> at <HI>Barnet Shillock,</HI> he im∣mediatly landed some men, and forcing the Irish to re∣tire to the mountains, he seiz'd upon a Magazine of the enemies, consisting of a good quantity of Powder, Match, Beere, <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> Salt Salmon, &amp;c. all which he carried on board without any losse, notwithstanding the opposi∣tion of 120. Muskettiers lodg'd in an adjacent thicket, that endeavoured to prevent the same, the said <HI>Ambus∣cado</HI> being forced to retreat to a Village, from whence they were beaten also, and the Village Plundred, Burnt and destroyed, together with the Magazine thereunto belonging; after which, he retired to his Ship without the losse of any one man, so great was the mercy of God in his preservation.</P>
<P>From hence he sayled into the <HI>Bay</HI> of the <HI>Bantery,</HI> ha∣ving a designe on the Town of <HI>Dingle de Couch,</HI> but un∣derstanding it had been newly sacked by Admirall <HI>Moul∣ton,</HI> he went to Anchor in the sound of the <HI>Blasketts,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>where hareing that a Flemish Ship was that day gone into the said Town of <HI>Dingle,</HI> he presently sent the Warspite and the Increase, to attempt the bringing her out, which was accordingly performed with much gallantry by Captain <HI>Southwood,</HI> and Captain <HI>Falconer</HI> in despight of 500. small shot that lined the banks, and endeavoured (but in vain) to Impede them.</P>
<P>With this prize (being the first taken upon that Coast) he steered to <HI>Kinsale;</HI> where arriving, the Lord <HI>Broghill,</HI> then Commander in chiefe of the Parliament Forces in <HI>Munster,</HI> being in great necessity, used some arguments to induce him to sell part of the prize there for ready money, and to supply him therewith, by which the Soldiers would be releeved, and he being thereby enabled to take the field, the interest of Parl. would be great∣ly advanced, (with which he complyed) as not holding his own interest any way compatible, when the publick was in ballance, as an evidence whereof he sold all or the greatest part of the best goods for ready money, supply∣ed him therewith, and received Bills charged upon the Parliament, upon which accompt there remaines to this day unsatisfied 3331.</P>
<P>The forementioned services and evidences of his Faith and affection so much to the knowledge of the Parlia∣ment, by representations from severall places, so far pre∣vailed, that a Commission was sent him from the Com∣mittee of the Admiralty, to be Commander in chief of the aforesaid Squadron, and all such other Ships as he could set out, or procure to joyne with him, which Ships were to follow his directions; whereupon hearing that the enemy was fortifying in the Isle of <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> which being known to the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> also (who was newly arrived there) and perceiving the evill conse∣quence
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>thereof, sent Cap: <HI>Williams</HI> a Commission to land thereon, with desire if possible to force the enemy out, and to secure the same for the service of the Parl. which he accordingly effected without the losse of one man; the enemy being forc'd to surrender upon quarter and promise of Transport to the maine Land, leaving all their Armes, Ammunition and Spoile behind them, which booty being most in Cattle and valued at 250. l. was e∣qually divided amongst the Marriners, Captain <HI>Williams</HI> disbursing the money, and retaining the Cattle there for the better support of the place.</P>
<P>Having reduc'd the said Island as aforesaid, and took an exact view thereof, and finding the same (although of a small value) in respect of it self, yet very considerable to the State, as lying convenient to secure or prejudice the Southern and Westerne trade, he first put in 35. able Seamen to secure the Castle, who remained there∣in untill he had procured it to be engarrisoned with a Lieutenant and 46. Soldiers of the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> Army, which were maintained at his own charge; soon af∣ter, he repayred the Castle, and furnished it with suitable provisions of all sorts, to his great expence, not doubting but when upon examination it should appear what preju∣dice the Parliament would have sustained, had the ene∣my possessed the same, he should have received an∣svverable satisfaction for his said services and expen∣ces.</P>
<P>The Island being setled, he againe put to Sea, and took the Ship Cat of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> laden with Salt and Tobacco, of which he made a man of Warre, and added her to his Squadron, but ranging to and fro upon the Irish coast for security of that Channell, all the Parlia∣ments Ships being called off, the winter growing on,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>and having by stresse of weather lost the <HI>Charls</HI> and In∣crease Frigots, he with the Mermaid and Warspite returned for <HI>England,</HI> leaving the Cat on that Coast, who soone after took in the River of <HI>Limbrick</HI> a conside∣rable prize, but he himselfe in <HI>England,</HI> they carryed her into <HI>Kinsale,</HI> and imbezel'd most of the goods, so that little advantage accrewed thereby; In which services successively, there is due to him for victualling, 620l. from the State, as may appeare by Bills signed by the Commissioners of the Navy.</P>
<P>But the best services many times receive the least re∣compence or respect, as may appeare by the subsequent part of this Narrative: for Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> his necessitated residence in <HI>England</HI> to procure from the Parl. the per∣formance of their engagements to him, their non-pay∣ment of the 333. l. due upon the Lo: <HI>Broghills</HI> Bills, nor the 620. l. due for victualling, as aforesaid, the charge of his Garrison in Cape Cleere, his family and friends in <HI>England</HI> ruin'd by the Enemie, together with the visible necessity lay upon him to supply the said Garrison with men, in lieu of those of the Lord <HI>Inchequeens,</HI> which were to march to their Regiment at <HI>Cork,</HI> reduced him to so great a necessity (against which he could see no visible possibility of obtaining reliefe from the Parl. or Com. of Safety in one case or other) that he which but few mo∣neths before was able and resolved to set forth to Sea, in the publique service with four men of Warre, a Gally, and two Brigandines, was hereby so disenabled, that he was forced to sell a Considerable part thereof, only re∣serving to himselfe the Mermaid and the two Brigan∣dines entire; which having effected, and knowing the time nigh expiring, wherein the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> men were to returne to their Regiment, and seeing little like∣lyhood
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>of gaining any thing from the Parliament or Com, of safety, that might conduce to the seasonable and effectuall settlement of the said Garrison and Isle, by reason of the daily encrease of new troubles; he was forced at his owne charge to send his Brother, Captain <HI>John Williams</HI> into <HI>Wales</HI> to raise and transport 30. men to engarrison the said Island, and to furnish them with all necessary supplyes that might enable them to secure the same, which work he sodainly effected, and arrived there in due time; the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> men being called off, and the charge thereof committed to him, im∣mediatly whereupon the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> Revolted from his obedience to the Parliament.</P>
<P>By which meanes, to the forementioned troubles a new one was added, and that of a much greater concernment; for by this revolt of the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI>'s the said Island of <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> was in danger to be lost, as to the Parlia∣men. Whereupon waving all other concernments, hee addressed himselfe to the then Committee of Safety, and laid before them the consideration of the place, with all the advantages, that by the security thereof would accrew to the publique, but could obtaine nothing but a single Order to enable him to take care thereof, and a promise of necessary supply, although to this day he never re∣ceived any.</P>
<P>But being engaged to improve his utmost abilities, to preserve the said Island, and finding no possibility of ob∣taining any recruit either of Men, Provisions, Armes, Ammunition or Cloaths; his own estate being nigh ru∣ined, and the Island no way able to resist the power of the Enemy; he immediatly dispatched complementall letters to the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> to amuse and divert him from designing or attempting any thing against the same.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<P>Immediatly whereupon, (having first obtained a let∣ter from the Committee of the Admiralty, to Captain <HI>Crowder</HI> Admirall of the Irish Seas, that he should con∣tribute his utmost assistance in securing the said Island) and having also with some difficulty obtained an Order from the Committee of the Navy for the payment of 400l. in course from Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> then Treasurer, as satisfaction for the victualling of his two Ships, the Helena and Mermaid; but no ready money being to be had thereon he was necessitated to take up 200l. upon Bottomry, for which he paid 350l. as principall, and ad∣venture for 8. months 100l. upon specialty in <HI>London,</HI> and 150l. in <HI>Bristoll,</HI> so great was his charge in victual∣ling, and procuring 60. Seamen besides Soldiers, by him taken up to be employed in the said service.</P>
<P>Being by the extraordinary appearance of God en∣abled to passe through all these difficulties, and out at Sea in the Mermayd, a dangerous combination was set on foot by some ill-affected persons, officers in the said Ships, who designed to cary the Ships to <HI>Illford</HI> Sluce, where the revolted Ships then lay; but the same was through mercy discovered and prevented, and the offenders seized and secured in the Parliament Garrison at <HI>Tenby</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> From whence, as soon as a supply could be got, to answer the number of the forementioned Con∣spirators, he set sayle for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in few dayes ar∣rived before the harbor of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> where coming to an Anchor without command, he writ another letter to the Lord <HI>Inchequeen,</HI> therein intimating, that according to his former letters he was come upon the coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with only one Ship; with which he was Commissioned to take upon the Irish by the Parliament, which service he was necessitated for 6. months to undertake as well to
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>repayre his fortunes ruined by the Irish, as to recover a cosiderable summe of money due to him for for∣mer service; and therefore desired his Lordship to take no notice of him for that time, but command the delive∣ry of a Brigantine by him built and remaining in harbour, and that he might have provision for his money, for which favour he should remaine (setting aside the afore∣said necessity) his Lordships most faithfull and obedient servant, &amp;c. With which Letter the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> was so fully satisfied, that he not onely ordered the Go∣vernour of <HI>Kinsalle,</HI> but all the other English Garrisons, to let Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> have what he desired for his mo∣ney; and his Brigantine was sent out accordingly, with which he immediately set sayle to <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> where ar∣riving, his Brother and Officers came aboard him, to whom he gave suitable instructions how to manage their businesse, competent supplyes to enable them thereto, and exchange of Soldiers for feare of deficiencie or com∣bination, together with an assurance of not onely frequent Visits, but Supplyes, as necessity should require.</P>
<P>Having thus secured the Island, he sayled toward the River of <HI>Limbrick,</HI> where hee took a small Prize, which in his returning to <HI>Cape Cleere</HI> was lost by foule weather. Soone after he met with a Dutch ship laden with Mer∣chants goods, and bound for <HI>Limbrick,</HI> which he resolved to secure in <HI>Bristol,</HI> but Providence ordered it otherwise, as by the sequel may appeare; and that dispen fation which he thought to be of a destructive tendencie, proved the onely meanes of the preservation of the said Island. For,</P>
<P>Sailing along the Coast, the wind being at N. N. West, betwixt <HI>Kinsale</HI> and the River of <HI>Corke,</HI> in the faire way, the Tide being very low, and his Prize ahead some few Ships length, she struck her Rudder against a Rock, but
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>went over without any considerable detriment: but Cap: <HI>Williams</HI> sayling speedily after, before ever they could by weasle, Gunne, or other signall give notice, his Ship draw∣ing more water, struck so violently, that 7. foot of one side of her Keele was broke off; and had she not been a very strong Ship, she had sunk down right, but with much labour the Pump kept her swimming: however he was forced to stand for <HI>Kinsale,</HI> where comming to an An∣chor as formerly, without Command, and not suffer∣ing any boat to come aboard him, for feare of discover∣ing his necessity; he writ againe to my Lord <HI>Inchequeen,</HI> and in four dayes obtained an Order to come into <HI>Port,</HI> to enjoy security there, with liberty to put his prize to sale, and assurance that he should be free to dispose of himselfe and affaires at his owne discretion, &amp;c. where∣upon he went into <HI>Port,</HI> haled his Ship ashore to be mended and expos'd to sale, the said prize.</P>
<P>While this was on foot, Captain <HI>Pen</HI> came with the Nonsuch Frigot into <HI>Kingsale</HI> with the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> eldest Sonne, to whom he went privatly and acquainted him how affaires stood with him, together with the reason of his being there, and by him to enform the Ad∣mirall of his designe, with the knowledge whereof he could not trust any of his owne party.</P>
<P>But Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> his condition, not being publickly known, some Gentlemen carried from <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Mil∣ford,</HI> reported at <HI>Tinby</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> that he was revolted with the Lord <HI>Inchequeen,</HI> whereupon a ketch by him taken formerly from a <HI>Wexford</HI> man, was seized on for the use of the State, but his Brother together with Co∣lonell <HI>Horton</HI> and Col: <HI>Jones,</HI> making an addresse unto the Admirall, who knew Capt <HI>Williams</HI> integrity, caused her to be returned; in whose custody she remained se∣verall
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>months, till afterward upon a scandalous Petition fraught with sundry false suggestions presented to the Generalls, she was ordered and delivered to a <HI>Dover</HI> man, that owned her some yeers before; whereby he was damnified nigh 300l.</P>
<P>But though it was his unhappinesse to suffer causelesly, his ensuing actions manifested that his affection was not resident with his body in <HI>Kinsale,</HI> for he had no sooner repayred his Ship, but he prepared to put to Sea, in which juncture of time, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with the Re∣volted Fleet came thither; who by an Order in favour of the <HI>Limbrick</HI> Merchants, notwithstanding <HI>Inchequeens</HI> engagement to the contrary) caused his Goods to be sei∣zed; but afterwards by the procurement of the Lo: <HI>Inche∣queen,</HI> they vvere againe freed; but with so much regret on the part of the Princes Adherents, that he went not onely in great danger of his life, but was left without all visible possibility (without an extraordinary providence) either to get his Ship to <HI>England,</HI> or secure the Island of <HI>Cape Cleere.</HI> Whereupon to escape their malice, and con∣nivance to get his Ship into their Fleet, he designed her for a Voyage to the West Indies with Passengers, which with much difficulty was effected, a Kinsman of his being trusted therewith; who at his returne was by him orde∣red to touch at <HI>Cape Cleere.</HI> That designe being accom∣plished, he then cast about how to secure the said Island untill the arrivall of the English Army, which he expect∣ed in the Spring, and the return of the said Ship. In order to which end, (after he had sold the remains of his goods, and performed such formalities to the Prince and Lo: <HI>In∣chequeen</HI> as his condition enforced) he betook himself to the Island, where he remained, untill he received intima∣tion of the losse of his Ship and goods, to the value of
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>3000.l. and the arrivall of the so long hoped and expect∣ed Army from <HI>England,</HI> under the command of the now Lo: Generall <HI>Comwell;</HI> to whom as soone as convenien∣cie was afforded him, he made a tender of his service, (some moneths before manifested by Letter to the Lord <HI>Broghill</HI>) which was received vvith evident testimonies of good will, and his services and affection acknowledged, with promise of future favours; but the Generall being by publique affaires withdrawn from that service, some persons to whom the management of affaires were (as to the securing of <HI>Cape Cleere</HI>) committed, who (as belce∣ved) were parties to the former false representation of his revolt; although they were now convinced of their error, yet apprehending they had justly prejudiced him against them, instead of salving the breach, withheld the reliefe intended for the Island, so that he was not onely a third time ruined in his Estate, but also the said Island and Garrison endangered to be lost to the Enemy, who took encouragement by his necessitated absence to attempt the besieging thereof, as by the following particulars will be undenyably evident.</P>
<P>First, by some under-hand suggestions they endeavou∣red to dispossesse him of the Command of the said Island, which being by the confident assertions of Sir <HI>Hardres Waller,</HI> and a perfect narrative of his services &amp; suffering, tendred to, and considered by the Lord Generall, cleared and removed, he had his Commission signed and delive∣red with Order that direction should be given to Col: <HI>Fayer</HI> Governour of <HI>Corke,</HI> to settle an establishment for the said Castle and Island, but notwithstanding all en∣deavours, that was for night three weeks obstructed, in which time Providence dispersed the enemy by meanes of a discontent that arose among themselves.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
<P>At length with much importunity, he obtained two files of Muskettiers, and an Officer, as a Recruit on the States pay, which were continued only one month in the Garrison, and then sent for away, unlesse Capt: <HI>Willi∣ams</HI> would maintaine them at his owne charge; neither were they content with this, but by some underhand working with the Commissioners for the Revenue, pro∣cured the Island to be offered at a Rent to who would give most: to colour which proceedings, a letter they shewed C: <HI>Williams,</HI> as pretended to be sent from the Lord Deputy <HI>Ireton,</HI> although it be evident by the purport thereof, if any such letter were sent by the Lo: Deputy; it was occasioned by some letter first writ to him, desiring his direction therein, otherwise he would never have re∣turned in answer; amongst severall other things, that unlesse they could prove Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> a Delinquent, it was but reason he should keep the Island, paying a Rent, &amp;c. whereupon he seeing the designe of his enemies was to take all possible occasions to eject him, he saw rea∣son and necessity to countermine them, to which end he submitted to a Rent, without Capitulation, whereupon 30l. <HI>per an.</HI> was imposed, and he enjoyned at his charge, to keepe Guard in the Castle, which contract being ra∣tified, he returned to the Island.</P>
<P>But the enemy perceiving how he was slighted, and that he was no way likely to receive any assistance or re∣liefe from the adjacent Garrisons, of which it is supposed they had intimation before hand, (as by the sequell if compared will appear probable) immediatly united as one man, contributing out of every family, upon an ex∣pedition for re-taking the said Island, as a place most con∣siderable for their refuge under the conduct of <HI>Cornelius O Driscoll,</HI> who was a person in quarter, but was made
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>Colonell for that defigne, who with the assistance of <HI>Osolivan Beare,</HI> who furnished Armes, Boats, Ordnance, and the like, and fifty of the most bloody Rogues in that part of the Countrey, having levyed their forces, they setled at <HI>Crooke</HI> Haven, some four Leagues from <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> there expecting an opportunity of transport and landing: for prevention whereof, Captain <HI>Williams</HI> designed his brother Captain <HI>John,</HI> to goe to Sea with a Boat man'd with ten Muskettiers, to see if he could fall into their quarters, and seize, burne or sinke their Boats, provided for their Transport, which failing, upon his re∣turne he was pursued with three of the enemies Boats, with whom he was forced to engage, and with whom he continued a desperate fight, many of the enemies being slaine, and their Boats forced to retire; after which, Captaine <HI>John Williams</HI> being by Gods providence pre∣served, with all his men, who received severall wounds, but none mortall, returned safe to the Island.</P>
<P>Soon after he received information that the enemy had appointed a Rendevouze at a place on the maine, two Leagues from the Island, whereupon he a second time sent out his Brother Captaine <HI>John Williams,</HI> with a small Skiffe manned, to the end he might fall in among them, to spoile their Boats, but the weather proving tur∣bulent, he took onely three, which by reason of the foulnesse of the weather, being disenabled to bring them to <HI>Cape Gleere,</HI> he carryed and secured at the next English Garrison; from whence he had foure Leagues to Row to <HI>Cape Cleere</HI> in foule weather, against the wind in a darke foggy night; but necessities overcoming all difficulties, to Sea he put, and being with much hazard got almost home, he fell among the enemies Boats, who were viewing a place where they intended to attempt
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>Landing, but being discovered by the enemy, a Contro∣versie arose between them whether it was an English Boat, or one of their owne Company; during which dispute he made a shift to get a small Rock betweene him and them, by which meanes he escaped, and got himself and most of his men safe on shore, and to the Castle.</P>
<P>But having no considerable strength, could no way fur∣ther impede their designe, or prevent their landing, but was constrained to endure a siege by 600. men, who im∣mediatly made their approaches within Pistoll shot of the Castle, where they raised a Battery, planted their Ordnance, and sent a summons to surrender the Castle upon good termes, but he denying to treat or surrender, they fell to battering the Castle, and spending small shot upon all places where they thought to annoy him, al∣though to small purpose, whereupon in a dark night they attempted a storme, but were repulsed, with the losse of 19. of their stoutest men, which were left dead under the walls, without any losse received by him in the said Castle.</P>
<P>The enemy seeing no probability of obtaining the Ca∣stle, onely continued their siege five or six dayes, till they had carryed away all his cattle, and stock in the Island, to the value of 800. l. as it was by Oath proved by order of the Commissioners of the Revenue. After which they marched away, and returned to their severall homes, and were received into quarter upon promise to pay contribu∣tion; his losses and sufferings being not deemed consider∣able to be put in the ballance, that he should merit repaire from that enemy.</P>
<P>For returne of which favour, within a short time after that very enemy fell into Rebellion againe, and commit∣ted many outrages. Whereupon the Lo: <HI>Broghill</HI> fell into their quarters, to whom the Commissioners of the Reve∣nue
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>writ a Letter, desiring him out of what prey he might or should take, to repaire Capt: <HI>Williams;</HI> but although he took all their Cattle, Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> could reap no bene∣fit thereby, in respect a precedent Order was pretended to be made by the Commissioners; whereby it was directed that all prey should be sold, and two thirds of the pro∣venue paid into the Treasury, and the other to the party engaged in the action. In this manner, contrary to all for∣mer presidents, (it being usuall to repaire the English up∣on the Baronies that prejudiced them) he was left without possibility of reliefe for his dammage sustained by that Enemy.</P>
<P>And therefore the premisses being duly weighed, and a serious consideration had both of his services and suffe∣rings, it is very much hoped, That both your Excellency, and all persons of worth and authority, will be pleased to cast a favourable eye and respect towards him, and speedily and effectually provide for his full reparation, and just satisfaction of whatsoever shall be made appeare to have been disbursed by him, or wherein soever he hath been damnified in service of the publick. To give light wherein, be pleased to examine the following account.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>By his being imployed in the taking, fortifying, and securing the same, he hath lost his Sea-imployment; in which if he had conti∣nued, would have yeelded him a considerable Revenue.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The losse of his owne Ship, worth</HI> — 3000. l. — 0 — 0</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>The losse of the</HI> Increase <HI>and</HI> Charges <HI>Frigots, with a Brigandine employed in defence of the said Island, toge∣ther with a Ketch del. by order of the Gen. to the value of</HI> 500. l.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>For Victualling due to him</HI> — 1033. l.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>There is expended by him in taking, fortifying, main∣taining and defending the said Castle and Island, as by an exact account will appeare,</HI> — 3000. l.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>For damage sustained by the Siege, &amp; losse of his cattle</HI> — 800. l.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
<P>By all which it may appeare, if duly examined, that by the preservation of that Isle and Garrison, he is damnified above 8000. l.</P>
<P>Besides the loss of his employment at Sea, which if improved, might have rendered him capable of a more then ordinary relation; over and above the probable e∣state that he might justly have accumulated to himselfe in his ordinary command as Captain.</P>
<P>But the forementioned losses and accidents arising thereupon, did reduce him to great necessity, his charge being certain and great, his debts contracted upon him for support of the Garrison, and other his relations nu∣merous, and no visible possibility left him of repaying the one, or supplying the other.</P>
<P>Whereupon seeing his endevours at Land, suted not to his desires, he resolved as his last refuge to try his own proper element, the Sea; to which purpose he built him a small Frigot, which being man'd and fitted, he accor∣dingly set Sayle, and had suddainly an opportunity of relieving two New-found Land ships, the one of <HI>Poole</HI> the other of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> the same being taken by the <HI>French,</HI> both which were restored to their proper owners. To conclude, after severall skirmishes, losses, hardships and hazards, God was pleased as a returne of his prayers, and reward of his industry and patience, to give him an op∣portunity to take upon the <HI>French,</HI> whereby he hath been enabled to pay a considerable part of his debts, and main∣taine his relations during the time of his Petitioning the Parliament to take his Case, Sufferings, Expences and Services into consideration; to the end the said Island of <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> never worth in times of peace above 100. l. <HI>per an.</HI> having been by him reduc'd so many yeers since, and maintained at his charge, might in consideration of
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>his said Services and Arreares be setled upon him and his Heires, he engaging to plant it with English, who shall pre∣serve the same without any charge to the State, and to re∣ceive debentures for his disbursements. In returne of which favour, if he had or could obtaine, (although his Arreares due for the keeping thereof, would according to the usuall valuation have purchased a much better e∣state) it would create an exceeding obligation in point of gratitude upon him, and futurely devote him, his abilities, life and estate, faithfully to be imployed and improved for advancement of the publick interest.</P>
<P>But God which is the wise disposer of all things, hath so ordered affaires, that his endeavours have been hither∣to fruitlesse; only he is kept up by a principle of depen∣dance, nay confidence, that though one Generation be passed away, that might have beene instrumentall in repayring not onely his breach, but the breaches of the Nation, yet that the time is at hand, wherein every man that hath with Faith, Affection and Fervour laid out him∣selfe and estate, for defence of the publique, shall be an∣swerably repayred, according to their services and suffe∣rings; In assurance whereof, he hath (principles of reason and necessity inducing) taken the boldnesse to draw up and present unto serious consideration this Narrative; In hope that when an opportunity shall be offered, he a∣mongst many others may be remembred and repaired by the payment of his disbursements and arrears, or settle∣ment of the said Island of <HI>Cape Cleere</HI> upon him and his heires, as desired for satisfaction thereof.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THis Narrative of my little peregrinations and services for this Nation, (yet not without many dangers and crosses to my self) to∣gether
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>with the hard measure I have hither to found where I had hopes of better, being prepared for the true information of all such as either ingeniously desire the same, or whose worth and authority may justly expect to be satisfied therein. I have presumed (yet in all humility) to addresse, more especially to your Excellency, in regard I found both in your selfe and your honoured son the Lord Deputy</HI> Ireton, <HI>so cleere a judgement of my actions in</HI> Ireland, <HI>so free from distorting things to the worst; so sensible of what a Soldier (without suspicion to his faith) might doe when surrounded with difficulties, as was sometimes my case with the Lo:</HI> Inchequeen. <HI>Thus as I must ever honor the memory of so large a worth and so cleer a goodnesse, so when occasion shall make me happy, I shall thankefully testifie to the uttermost of my abilities; And as I was blest</HI> there, <HI>with this favour from you, which (had not others envied) had eas'd me of this publication, and unwelcome speaking of my selfe; so must I with all thankfulnesse acknowledge, that in all my late long attendance upon the Parl, to have my services and sufferings taken into consideration, I have found none more ready and forward then your Excellencie. And now my Lord, my hopes upon the late Parliament ending with its dissolution, there is not any in this world so capable of ministring reliefe to my languishing condition; nor (as I have good cause to believe) so inclinable to do me right as your Ex∣cellency, and therefore if where I have found the greatest vertue and readinesse to help, I presse with more importunity then well becomes me: Let my necessity somewhat excuse; and beare it I beseech you, as the greatest goodnesse hath ever beene accustomed; and be pleased to favour me yet so far forth as to put my humble desires herein expressed into some speedy way of tryall, as to the justnesse of them, and when they shall so appeare, into as speedy a course for their attainment. To which end, a Petition to the Councell of State is in readines, that by your Ex∣cellencies favourable protection, both my selfe and Family may be sup∣ported and encouraged; and be preserved from that calamity, misery, and reproach, which malicious and ill affected persons wish unto us for our constant affection to this Common-wealth, and faithfull adherence to your Excellencie, for whose fruition of all temporall and eternall hap∣pinesse shall ever pray,</HI></P>
