<HEAD>A great and BLOUDY FIGHT AT SEA, Between five Men of War belonging to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and a great part of the Princes FLEET.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Wednesday last, being the 7. of this instant there happened a great and bloudy Fight at Sea between the English and the Irish, neere the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the manner thus: Capt. <HI>Peacocke</HI> (a man of known and faithfull integrity to the Parlia∣ment) sayling towards the Irish Seas with five Men of War, for cleering the channell about <HI>Dublin</HI> of Pyrates
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>and Robbers, discovered a Fleet of ships about three leagues distant, who immediatly made towards them, and comming within Canon-shot, hayled them in, to know what they were, and whence they was bound; who replyed, that they belonged to the Parliament of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and were bound for the relief of <HI>Dublin;</HI> but say∣ling near to each other, Captain <HI>Peacock</HI> discovered them to be Enemies, who presently gave them a broad side; whereupon the Enemies Rear-Admirall answerd them with another Volley, insomuch that a hot dispute began, continuing for the space of an hour, and although the Enemy was two for one, yet (by divine providence, and the assistance of the Almighty) by the gallantry of the said Captain <HI>Peacock,</HI> and his Sea-men, he became victorious, and after a bloudy Conflict, sunk two of the Enemies ships, and near upon 70. men, and boarded the Rear-Admirall; the rest escaped having a faire Gale of Wind to separate them from their Engagement, and the raging Billowes forcing them to the Ocean for sanctu∣ary.</P>
<P>This Fleet consisted of ten Sayl, five whereof belong∣ing to the Princes Fleet, the rest Irish, who were desig∣ned against <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>The ship which was boarded, was called the <HI>Patrick,</HI> being Rear-admirall to the Fleet, wherein was forty piece of Ordnance, six Tun of Match, twenty Barrels of powder, and about two hundred Sea-men.</P>
<P>In this Conflict divers were slain on both sides, Cap∣tain <HI>Peacock</HI> lost near upon twenty men, and his owne ship (called the Dragon) was in great danger of being sunk, who leaked exceedingly betwixt Wind and Wa∣ter; but by the great ingenuity and vigilancy of the car∣penters
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>she was preserved: the Enemies losse is very great, and doth far exceed the other: and many of the prisoners now in custody exceedingly wounded. This happy newes was communicated unto us by a Fisher∣man, who with his Bark struck into this Harbour, being chased from Sea by the dispersed Fleet.</P>
<P>Upon proclaiming of the late Act of parliament, and fixing it upon posts, the adverse party seemed to be much grieved thereat, and when the dark Curtaines of the most high Canopy were drawn, they caused the said <HI>Act</HI> to be pulled down, and in stead thereof, caused a most treasonable paper to be set up, wherein they de∣clared their inveterate malignancy, to sacrifice their lives and fortunes. in the defence and preservation of Monarchical Government, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But all diligent care is taken for discovery of the chief abetters and Fomenters of the said treasonable paper; which they perceiving, begin now to be very silent.</P>
<P>There are great discontents appearing in several parts throughout North and South Wales; but their design is (as yet) of small maturity, and its conceived will not be of any consequence, unlesse <HI>Laughornes</HI> Brother, and others from <HI>Ireland</HI> prove instrumentall for the delive∣ry of this great Machavilian Monster into the World; but we hope it will now be frustrated, by reason of the late blow given to the Enemy at Sea.</P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P> Other Letters from the VVest make mention, That divers of the well-affected in the Counties adjacent, upon a meeting near Warham, on the 3. of this instant, declared their Resolutions, and entred into protestation, to sacrifice lives and fortunes in the defence of Parlia∣ment and Army, for the obtaining of Justice, Liberty, and Freedom, together with the common Rights of the people of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And do desire, that impartiall Justice may (without detraction of time) be forthwith executed upon all Offendeas wdo have beene ayding and assisting in this tyrannicall, and bloudy war, and promoted the Designes of the adverse party, against the well-affected of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Since which Declaratory Expressions from the said well-affected party, the spirits of malignancy have been much abated in these parts: But in some parts of He∣reford, &amp; Somertsetshire, the Coles of Enmity are kind∣ling, and ready to break forth into new flames of Dis∣cord and Contention, the Clergy stirring up the people in their pulpits, and using all meanes possible to incite them to an Engagement against the <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Ar¦my.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The death of his Majesty was conveyed to us by an expresse the 6 of this instant; much lamentation was here for the losse of their Native Soveraign, both by the Royall and presbyterian party, with much threat∣ning for revenge of his bloud, which they will doubtless put into a speedy way of execution against the next Spring, and to shew a testimony of their dis-satisfacti∣on herein, some disaffected persons have this day pro∣claimed <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> eldest Son to <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> the first, late King of Great Brittain, King of Scotland, and to the end that none may plead ignorance therein, have ordered that the same bee proclaimed at the Market-crosse throughout every Burgh in the Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> which is not contradicted or gainsayed by the par∣liament, or rather Kirk of this Nation; a foundation of another war is laid herein, but what proceedings there∣upon, a short time will discover: Yet divers of the E∣states conveened in parl. have declared, That before Hee be admitted to his Royal power, He shall give an assu∣rance for the security of Religion, and the liberty and safety of the people, according to the solemne League and Covenant between both Kingdoms.</P>
