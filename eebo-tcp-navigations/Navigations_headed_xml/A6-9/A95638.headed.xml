<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Iis Excellency General Blake ha∣ving received Advertisements of a great Fleet of ships, under sayl Northwards, supposed them to be Hans, designed for the relief and safety of the Fle∣mish Busses: whereupon, Major Bourn was commanded forth with seven Scouts, to make a discovery thereof; and coming with∣in
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>a League of them, found them to be men of War, having their streamers, Jacks, and bloudy Flags all forth; Admiral Hantz being Commander in chief, selected forth Ten chief ships, to give Us a revengeful sa∣lute; which Major Bourn perceiving, pre∣pared to receive them, sending the Saphir back to the General, to hasten up the rest: the Dutchmen being exceedingly inraged, with great fury bore up to us, with their Pendants flying, and Thunder-like their broad sides they let flye; we answer'd them again, putting forth our bloudy flags in de∣fiance; and in the midst of our dispute, each man acting with a most heroick mind, our General made up to us with 37 sayl; which the Dutch Admiral seeing, bore up with 40 stout ships to them; and entring battle, sa∣luted Us with many great vollies; we rung them the like peals again; and after two ho: dispute, maintained with great resolution on
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>both sides, we came to grapling, in which ac∣tion the Land-souldiers performed singular service, but was several times blown up and repelled from the Enemies decks; til at last the nimble Saphir bore up to the head of their Admiral; fired both sailes and tackling, shot her in the Keel; and immediatly upon the next broad side sunk her; at which in∣stant, most of our ships being engaged, the General resolved to bear up, and to play the Granadoes; the which, was with such dexterity of spirit attempted, that in a mo∣ment 5 of their ships was fir'd, which could by no means be extinguish'd; 17 we took; sunk 9, dispersed, rent, and torn many of them, but not without loss; and had not the sable Curtains of the night prevented, we had made the victory far more glorious; but we are in pursuit, &amp; have sent 700 prisoners to Dunbar, with some ships.</P>

<P>The Lord Admiral Vantrump is come into the
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>Downs; where the Dutch maintained a very sharp dispute for many hours together; and great was the loss on both sides: Many gallant ships being sunk and fired; But by reason of the great might and power of the Enemy; their number far exceeding ours; it was thought most requisite to decline, and tack about for Dover Cliff; which we did, with ve∣ry little loss: So that now we are secure, and under the protection of the Castle; but expect every hour another engagement; which is a thing gene∣rally desired both by the Sea-men and souldiers; onely it is waved for the present, by reason that Vice-Admiral Pen is every minute expected with a Squadron of ships for our assistance, which will then compleat us 30 Sayl, gallantly man'd, and well re∣solved.</P>
<P>Vantrump lies three leagues distance; and is re∣solved forthwith to ingage Us; as captain Vand-Erst informs Us, who hath deserted them, and decla∣red for the Parliament.</P>
<P>He likewise bringeth intelligence, That the States have given Orders for the re-inforcing their Mari∣tine Towns and Castles; and have declared to the People, That our Admiral intends to land some souldiers about the Brill, and Flushing, with a Reso∣lution to cut down the Dammes, or Sea-walls, and
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>so drown the Countrey. The allarum whereof hath so exasperated the spirits of many, that they are ex∣ceedingly inraged, and vowes revenge.</P>
<P>We hear that there is a general Rising from 16 to 60; and those that do refuse to to engage, are to die without mercy. They are setting forth another great Fleet of 200 sail, and the Zealanders have cho∣sen a new Admiral. In our last engagement, our loss is esteemed killed and wounded about 300. The E∣nemies far greater.</P>
<P>There is dayly Action between our Scouts, and Trumps; and this morning captain Peacock, with the Tyger, going to relieve the Guard, was set upon by three Dutch-men, who maintained a gallant dis∣pute, for the space of half an hour; which our Ad∣miral hearing of, dispatched captain Watson and captain Taylor to his assistance, who bearing up close to them, saluted them with several broad sides, insomuch that one immediatly sunk by their sides; the other two got off, but much batter'd and torn, as well as ours; some having their legs and armes shot off; others lamentably shot and mangled. We hear that General Blake hath a design to block up the Zound, which will greatly frustrate &amp; eclipse their liberty, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Most of the Parliaments forces are ad∣vancing towards the sea coast, in Kent and Essex; the greatest part of the foot are to be boarded as occasion shal serve; the Militia of the Countrey come in with great alacri∣ty: The ships that lay in the Hope are joy∣ned with Sir George Ayscue in the downs, which makes him compleat about 32 sayl: All which are as well man'd, both with he∣roick spirits, and sons of Mars, as Europe can afford. Great preparations are making for another engagement; and sudden Acti∣on is expected.</P>
