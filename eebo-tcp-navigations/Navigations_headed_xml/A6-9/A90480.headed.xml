<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Officers of the Army having had a General Meeting at <HI>James's Westminster,</HI> about the emer∣gent and weighty Affairs of the Nation; in con∣sideration thereof, agreed upon a Letter to be sent to the Officers of the several Garisons and Regiments of souldiers both in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> a breviate whereof take as followeth; <HI>to wit,</HI></P>
<P>That after several dayes waiting at the Throne of grace, we were generally convinced, That our hearts have been looking after the things of this world, and our own privat affairs, more then the things of Jesus Christ and his peo∣ple. That we have been overtaken with a slothful spirit, &amp; growing weary of the work of the Lord, have been ready to say with <HI>Baruch, Wo is me now, for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow, I fainted in my sighing, and find no rest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Jer. 45.3. That the people of this Nation are subject to grie∣vous oppressions through the obstruction of justice: and that the Lord might say to us, for whom he hath done such great things in <HI>England,</HI> as he did to his Vineyard, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.7. <HI>And he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righ∣teousness, but behold a Cry.</HI> That through the corruption of many in places of Authority some good men are made to suffer for conscience sake, and many bad men take incou∣ragement in their licentious principles, and prophane pra∣ctises, by reason whereof wickedness doth very much a∣bound amongst us. Upon these and the like considerations
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> we have been strongly convinced, that it is a duty very much incumbent upon us to awaken our selves, and by all lawful wayes and meanes to endeavor the procuring of these following things, which have been promised by the Parliament, and, as we are informed, are under their pre∣sent consideration.</P>
<P>First, For the preventing the many inconveniencies ap∣parently arising from the long continuance of the same persons in supreme Authority, That there may be succes∣sive Parliaments consisting of men faithful to the interest of this Common-wealth; Men of Truth, fearing God, and hating covetousness.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Laws may be regulated in such sort, that what is good in them may be maintain'd, and the cor∣ruptions, abuses, delayes, vexations, unnecessary Travels and expences, and whatsoever shall be found really bur∣thensome and grievous to the people, may be taken a∣way</P>
<P>Thirdly, That liberty and protection may be given by a Law to all the truly godly though of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fferent judgments to worship God peaceably, with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imposing upon, or molesting one another. And that no enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment be thereby given to such as are popish or proph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne in the ex∣ercise of their superstitious forms, or licentious practises.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the Gospel of Jesus Christ may be dis∣pensed to all the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple of this Commonwealth, and those that labour faithfully in that work, receive all due coun∣tenance and encouragement.</P>

<P>The first of this instant the great Duke was pleased to create himself in a Galley upon the water; and at his going out, the Dutch Admiral gave him 9 guns, and all the rest
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> of his Fleet in order. At his going in we gave him two Vollies of small shot, and 31 guns, and the rest of our ships in order. The 3. of Jan. his Highness sent aboard a Present to Cap. <HI>Badiley.</HI> The 4. here came a messenger from Naples to the Captain, who brought Letters, informing us, That the Elizabeth and the Warwick have taken a Dutch ship bound for Apulia. She was light, having in her 26 Guns. The 5 instant here came aboard the great Dukes brother, who is a Cardinal, and another Prince with him; and at their going away Cap. <HI>Badiley</HI> gave them 31 Guns.</P>
<P>This day, by Letters from our English Merchants at Aleppo, we are adver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ised that our English Conful there resident, has received Letters from the English President in the East Indies, That at Amboyna, an Island now under the command of the Dutch, which they got in time past by bloud and treachery, there rode 9 Dutch ships at An∣chor, which by a sudden storm were cast away. Most of their men got ashore thinking to save their lives; but the Natives rose, and put them all to the sword, and immedi∣atly fell upon the Towns and Fortifications, and took them all except one castle. They put man, woman, &amp; child to the sword.</P>
<P>The English President wrote further, That he thought the Natives had gained or would quickly gain the re∣maining Castle, and that very suddenly.</P>
<P>I saw a copy of the Letter that came from our Aleppo Consul, and heard it read to Cap. Badiley aboard our ship. A just Judgment of the Almighty on the Dutch, for mur∣thering so many English as they did formerly on that very Island.</P>
<P>We hear that Cap. <HI>Cox,</HI> with 7 sail of English, hath had a sharp conflict with 11 sail of Dutch; but after four hours dispute obtained a glorious Victory, sunk one, and took Three.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Holland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe States are very busie about hastning away the new Fleet, and have sent Orders to Trump, to repair forthwith into the Channel; so that he is suddenly expected from the Isle of Ree; he hath about <HI>70</HI> fighting ships, and some <HI>300</HI> Merchants. Prince Rupert is expected by some; but when he will return, no man knowes, for as yet there is no certain news of his being in any part of the world. Here are two Irish-men lately arrived out of Ireland, they have Letters from Charles Stuart, to countenance their ad∣dresses to the State in the behalf of the Irish; yet before they deli∣ver them, they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken the advice of the holy Fathers of their own faction, of whom there is a crew now residing at the Hague, as well as in other places; and their design (if possible) is to stir up and ingage this State to do somewhat against the Parliament of England in Ireland. On Wednesday one of these Irish factors de∣livered a Letter to their High and Mighties at the Hague. This gives just occasions to suspect that the Scottish King endeavors to hook his own interest into the ingagement of this Hogen State, upon an Irish account, so that if the Dutch should clap in between these two interests, they would be daintily ingaged, and a fine blessing must follow the business.</P>

<P>BEing the 23 instant upon the North coast in company with a Fleet of <HI>Lyn</HI> ships bound hither, we fell in com∣pany with a man of War belonging to <HI>Flushing,</HI> which had taken some small English. Our Captain immediatly gave chase to this man of war, and after an houres chase he came up with him; who after the firing of one broad side, yield∣ed his ship: After which we rescued two of the Vessels he had taken. We are now arrived here with the fleet and the prise, which is a ship of 15 serviceable Iron guns, and well appointed with Sailes, Cables, and Ammunition.

<P>Here is no great newes, but too much sorrow: A <HI>Toulon</HI> French man of war hath taken an English ship laden with 370 Hogsheads of Pilchards, which is brought into this Port, where they intend to make sale thereof; and in very few dayes there will be 4 men of war more out of <HI>Tonlon,</HI> to go in course, besides those ships and fire-ships designed for West France.</P>
<P>From <HI>Nantes</HI> we have received advertisements of a <HI>Lon∣don</HI> ship of 16 guns brought thither as a prize by a Holan∣der, boudd from Bilboa to the Canary Islands; the Masters name being Mr. <HI>Crane.</HI></P>
<P>But that which doth equalize this loss, is, the taking of a Flemish Vessel, called, the Arms of Genoa, by the War∣wick frigat, who carryed her to Naples. Besides, the Pearl, the Temple of Solomon, the Dragon, and 10 more are cast
