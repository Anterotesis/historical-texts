<HEAD>True <HI>ACCOUNT</HI> of the Invitation and Entertainment of the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Y.</HI> at <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall,</HI> by the <HI>ARTILLERY-MEN,</HI> on Tuesday <HI>October 21<SUP>th.</SUP> 1679.</HI> In a Letter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last, I sent you a printed Paper, intituled <HI>Londons Choice of Citizens,</HI> &amp;c. which I could testifie to the truth of in almost all the particulars: And therefore I forbore to give it you in writing. But there having pass'd in publick since that, somewhat which may seem to im∣peach the Certainty of that Relation in point of the Cities affection to the D. of <HI>Y</HI>'s. Interest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thought good to give you such an account of that Affair, as my Occasions and Opportunities <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ll give me leave to be acquainted with.</P>
<P>You may wonder indeed that, (after the Citizens by their Addresses to the Lord Maior, for in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>asing the City-Guards, in respect of the greater danger by the D's presence at Court; and their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> publick and unanimous owning of their former Choice of Par-liament-men, and in them the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>l of Exclusion of the D. pass'd by the Commons of <HI>England</HI> in Parliament,) you may wonder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say) that the Artillery-Company, which contains about 700 Citizens and others, should invite <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e D. to such a publick Entertainment, which bears the face of great Respect and Honour: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen you are acquainted with the Reason and Manner of it, you will see no Inconsistency in these <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ings, nor Mutability in the minds of the Citizens.</P>
<P>You may please to know, that some years ago the D. of <HI>Y.</HI> was chosen to be Chief Leader or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ptain of this Company, and with him many Lords and Courtiers were admitted members of it: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that if we may judge by the choice of Stewards, both the last Year, and for the Year ensuing, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e may perceive as many great Courtiers as Citizens to have place in it. For the last year the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ewards are named to us to have been, the Earl of <HI>Ossory,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Feversham,</HI> Coll. <HI>Legg,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Robert Holmes,</HI> of the Court; of the City, Sir <HI>John Chapman,</HI> Sir <HI>Rich. How,</HI> Maj. <HI>Horn,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>pt. <HI>Hudson.</HI> Now the Stewards bearing all the Extraordinary Charge, it is at ther liberty to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rite whom they please: How then could it be imagin'd that these, who are half of them Cour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rs, and the other half Courtly Citizens, should omit any such thing as might tend to the Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tation of the D's. Interest, as they hoped this would prove: And for the same cause the D. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uld not but accept of the Invitation. Nay, it is commonly said, he gave 200 <HI>l.</HI> towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ast. He was attended with his Troop of Guards, and pass'd coming and going through the most <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>blick Streets to and from <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall,</HI> where they Dined; whither his R. H. came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s we are told in the <HI>Gazette</HI>) about an hour before the Artillery-men. For it is usual on these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccasions to have Prayers and a Sermon, which was perform'd at <HI>Bowe-Church</HI> in <HI>Cheap-side;</HI> to which place they marched from their Rendezvous at <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> about Eighty or Ninety men. Their Preacher was a person whose Anti-English Principles are well enough known by his printed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermons; in one of which Preached in <HI>January</HI> last, he falls foul upon a great man for declaring, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the King is King by Law;</HI> and concerning the dismal Fires which were before that time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>early discover'd to be effected by Papists, this Preacher assigns them (as <HI>Langhorn</HI> once) to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>dgements of God upon us; and so he may the Sufferings of the Martyrs in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>The Sermon ended, they marched from Church to Dinner; first the Stewards, then the Lord Maior, and Nine or Ten Aldermen, not the Court of Aldermen, as the <HI>Gazetteer</HI> is pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell us; for they require Thirteen to make a <HI>Quorum,</HI> and their Number is Twenty four: Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e rest in their order, which in all, Captains and other Commission Officers, with Serjeants, Corporals, Marshals, and other common men being reckon'd, amounted (as I am inform'd) to One hundred twenty eight. Not but that some hundreds of other Citizens of this Company had paid the usual Ticket-money (which is 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI>) and taken Tickets for admittance; but not being willing to give the countenance of their presence to that Entertainment, when they under∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tood the D. was there; some made no use of their Tickets, some tore them to pieces, some gave them to their Porters, or other mean men, that they apparel'd in their Holiday Cloaths might be admitted to feast with the D. But others sold them for 12 <HI>d.</HI> or 6 <HI>d.</HI> apiece, as they could meet with persons whose curiosity led them to behold the manner of that Assembly, and take part of their Cheer; with such Guests as these they furnisht their Tables. Thus indeed the Entertainment might be great, because the Company was little: And it might be splendid too in the Eyes of such as never were at the like before. But it is not to be doubted but the Noble Stewards (especially if assisted with the D's. Purse) would make the Entertainment suitable to the design they had in the Invitation.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P>After Dinner, we are told, his R. H. return'd to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> leaving the Company ex∣treamly pleased with the Honour he had done them. <HI>Honor est in honorante,</HI> is usually said but if I durst presume to give my Judgement in this case, I should determine that his R. H. ra¦ther was extreamly pleas'd with the Honour they had done him: For certainly he cannot b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> resent it kindly, that some Citizens should be made to seem to treat him with Honour in th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> City, whom the late Commons in Parliament thought worthy to be treated much otherwise. This Entertainment was (I doubt not) design'd to retrieve a little in the Eye of the Nation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Reputation the <HI>York</HI>-Interest lost in the late Choice of Parliament-men; and it may perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> with those that look no further than the <HI>Gazzette</HI> for Intelligence; but whether it will do so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no with those that acquaint themselves with the true Circumstances of things, I leave you to judge.</P>
<P>I need not take notice of what the <HI>Domestick Intelligence</HI> tells you, that among other Health<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> they drank one to the happy Succession in the Right Line; for it's reported they drank so ma∣ny Healths, that one of the Grave City Sirs lost his Beaver-Hat and Golden Hat-band, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the greater Company to sport with the Foot-boyes; nor of the D's. Promise to defend the Re∣ligion establish'd by Law in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if indeed he made any such Promise; for no man can think, but that he who is obliged by the Principles and Articles of his Church, un∣der the Penalties of Excommunication, and consequently Damnation in the world to come; and of Deposition from and Deprivation of his Crowns and Dignities, with the danger of his Life by Stab, Pistoll, Poyson, Warr or otherwise, in this World; to extirpate and destroy all He∣reticks; I say it cannot be imagin'd but a Jesuited Papist will prove an excellent Defender of the Religion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> establish'd by Law; since all the Members of our Church are every year solemnly condemn'd for Hereticks by the Pope. And why should we doubt, since he has given his word for it to the <HI>Artillery-men,</HI> but he will Govern according to Law, and secure to us all the Immunities, Rights and Defences that our Laws give us, when he comes to be Supreme; since he is not now capable of bearing of any Office or Trust in the Govern∣ment whatsoever, being excluded therefrom for the necessary Preservation of the Government and Religion.</P>
<P>But I must not omit to tell you what happened in the D's. return thorow the <HI>Poultrey.</HI> For there in passing through the many Hundreds of Beholders, a Cry arose, <HI>No Pope, no Pope; No Papist, no Papist;</HI> this attended him up into <HI>Cheapside;</HI> as in the Morning at his coming within <HI>Temple-barre,</HI> the People began to Hiss, and utter their distaste.</P>
<P>You may see by this, how little they gain'd by their project of a publick Entertainment, which indeed was no more an Act of the City, than if the Stewards of one of the Forty eight Companies had invited the D. and of that Company a sixth or seventh part only had appear'd: which is another happy demonstration of the constant Affection of the Citizens to their Reli∣gion and Government, and Aversation to Popery.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a very faithful Account of this Transaction, so far as it is come within my know∣ledge. I doubt not of your taking it in good part, and for an Evidence that I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
