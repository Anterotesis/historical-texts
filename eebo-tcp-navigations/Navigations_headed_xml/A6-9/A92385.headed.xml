<HEAD>A Relation of what passed in Con∣naught between His Majesties Forces under the Command of Brigadier Sarsfield, and the Re∣bels Led by the Lord VVey∣er, the Collonels Floyd, Russel, &amp;c. upon the Army Decamping from Allardstown.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OGaras</HI>'s Regiment of Foot, Collonel <HI>Luttrell</HI>'s of Horse, Sir <HI>N.</HI> ô <HI>Neil</HI>'s of Dragoons were ordered to march under the Command of Brigadier <HI>Sarsfield,</HI> upon intelligence brought to <HI>His Majesty</HI> that <HI>Schomberg</HI> had sent a <HI>Party</HI> to strengthen the Rebels in the <HI>Province of Connaught,</HI> which they by that time had almost over-run. The Brigadier had likewise <HI>Commission</HI> to joyn to His Body such of the <HI>King's Troops</HI> as lay most convenient in his <HI>March.</HI> With this Strength he ventur'd to make several <HI>De∣tachments,</HI> one of two hundred <HI>Foot</HI> to aid the Gentle∣men of the Countrey, who with the new raised <HI>Mo∣bile</HI> had Block'd up <HI>James-town</HI> then in the enemies hands. Upon <HI>his Arrival</HI> at <HI>Athlone,</HI> the <HI>Key of that Province,</HI> he sent another Party to take possession of another <HI>Pass</HI> betwixt <HI>Boile</HI> and <HI>Sligoe,</HI> upon the <HI>Curlew Mountain,</HI> to cut of all communication from the Garrisons of <HI>James-Town</HI> and <HI>Boyle,</HI> with that of <HI>Sligoe,</HI> he then advanced into the Countrey, and from <HI>Roscommon</HI> sent another Party of 90 <HI>Horse,</HI> and 80 <HI>Dragoons,</HI> under the <HI>Command of Collonel Henry L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trell,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>to prevent the Enemies <HI>burning or destroying</HI> all places they should think fit to abandon upon his approach. <HI>In their March</HI> they <HI>overtook, and put to</HI> flight a party of two hundred Horse of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y, with a prey they had taken of a thousand head of Cattel. <HI>Lut∣trell</HI> pursued them fourteen miles▪ obliging them to quit their Prey, and run back in full speed to the <HI>Boile,</HI> and endeavoured yet further th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> night <HI>towards Slygo,</HI> but were prevented by Major <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>k Bourke,</HI> who Commanded the <HI>Detachment</HI> sent by <HI>Sarsfield</HI> to secure that <HI>Pass.</HI> The Lord <HI>Weyer</HI> who commanded that party of the <HI>Enemy,</HI> and above fifteen of his men were killed, and several wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavouring to force it. The day before Collonel <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loyd</HI> from <HI>Sligo,</HI> with a party of Rebels attempted to come up to <HI>Boile,</HI> but was two several times beaten back with loss. The party commanded by <HI>Weyer,</HI> prevented in their de∣sign of going to <HI>Sligo,</HI> retired strait to <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>-town,</HI> and joyned the Enemies Garrison. The next morning they all abandoned that place, and marched towards the County of <HI>Cavan,</HI> either to joyn <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>homberg</HI>'s at <HI>Dundalk,</HI> or make their way thorough to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>illen.</HI> But those of ours that blocked up <HI>Jamestown</HI> having timely notice pursued them so close that they were Forced like Hard Hunted deer to take soyl and swim three Rivers in which there were 80 drowned and several killed, nor do we finde of 400 <HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Dragoones</HI> of which number that party consisted, ten got Home together, <HI>Sarsfield</HI> still continued his March to <HI>Boyle,</HI> and thence to <HI>Sligoe,</HI> when he had reach'd <HI>Collooney</HI> six miles short of the end of his March finding that the Enemy had broke the Bridg of <HI>Ballysedare</HI> a mile and a half on the other side of <HI>Coloony,</HI> and being well inform'd of the Country he sent a detatchment of three hundred Foot, seventy Horse and one hundred Dragoones under the Com∣mand of <HI>Collonel Lutterell</HI> a private way about by the Mountain Foot in order to cut off those that sustain∣ed the Bridge, and at the same time advanced to it
<PB N="3" REF="2"/>with his Party to amuse The Enemy, whilst <HI>Luttrell</HI> came round, at which time Mr. <HI>Talan∣dier</HI> Lieutenant Coll. to Sir <HI>N: ô N.</HI> was wounded in <HI>the</HI> Groin <HI>Luttrells</HI> guide carried him nearer <HI>Sligoe</HI> then <HI>Sarsfield</HI> designed, where he met with a Party com∣ing from <HI>Sligoe</HI> under the command of Coll. <HI>Russel,</HI> and at the same time those at the Bridge finding that <HI>Lutrell</HI> was got round, Return'd under the Command of Coll. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> so that they were both in the Rear and Front of <HI>Luttrell</HI> whose <HI>Dragoones</HI> and <HI>Foot</HI> were not yet got quite up to him by reason of a long Defile, upon which he divided what <HI>Horse</HI> he had, making half of them Face those in their Rear, and with the other half he himself charged those in his Front, and upon the first Onset broke both the Parties, killing Fifty upon the place the rest he pursued in sight of <HI>Sligoe,</HI> at the same time <HI>Sarsfield</HI> made up the Bridge the Enemy had abandon'd with <HI>Ioyces</HI> and <HI>Planks</HI> he had provided for that purpose and Marched with all dilligence to Relieve <HI>Luttrell</HI> who had before he could get up to him, beaten the Enemy again that had rallied at the <HI>Barriers</HI> of the <HI>Town,</HI> which <HI>were</HI> well maintained by som <HI>French Foot,</HI> By this time <HI>Sarsfield</HI> was come up and all the <HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Foot</HI> that were in the Town Ran away with <HI>Lloyd</HI> and <HI>Russel,</HI> except some four or 500 that shut themselves up within a Fort in the further end of the Town which immediatly was Blocked up and <HI>Trenches</HI> being opened in five days before it, on the 5th they Capitulated to march to <HI>Inniskillen,</HI> which was Granted by <HI>Sarsfield</HI> his men being spent by a long march, in bad way and ill weather, which con∣tinued while they lay in the Trenches. As soon as <HI>Sarsfield</HI> became Master of the Town, he Ordered it imediatly to be Fortifyed and the Fortificati∣ons are already so far advanced and the place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o capable of being made strong, that the whole Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince is hereby secured under His <HI>Majesties Obedience.</HI></P>
