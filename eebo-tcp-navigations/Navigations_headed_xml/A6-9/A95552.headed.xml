<L>Ayre serves all creatures in community)</L>
<L>And though earth yeeld materialls for the fire,</L>
<L>Which many a sonne (by right) holds from his sire,</L>
<L>Yet sure me thinkes the water should be free</L>
<L>For passage, for all men of each degree.</L>
<PB REF="6"/>
<L>And though the Rivers in proportions are</L>
<L>Shar'd thine, or mine, or this or that mans share</L>
<L>Yet sure, where God gives water, boates to beare</L>
<L>It should not be stop'd up, with Mill or Weare.</L>
<L>And now my meaning plainer to disclose,</L>
<L>A little while I'le turne my Verse to Prose.</L>
</LG>
<P>AS Raine from the <HI>Firmament</HI> is drawne from the Sea, and other waters and vapours of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and <HI>Ayre,</HI> by the vigour of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> whereby Rivers spring and overflow Grasse, Groves, Fruits encrease, fishes multiplie, beasts and cattell breede and waxe fat, Corne plentifulls, Butter and Cheese in abun∣dance, and all other blessings for the life of man or beast is nourished with milke of Heaven (as raine may justly be called) So Navigable Rivers are the Cheri∣shing veines of the body of every Countrey, King∣dome, and Nation: And as the veines of man doth distill supporting sustinence, to every part and mem∣ber of his Body; so doe passable Rivers convey all manner of commodities from place to place, to the benefit of all and every place in every Countrey and Teritorie.</P>
<P>My selfe bearing a naturall affection to Portable Rivers, and a setled inclination and desire of the pre∣servation and use of them, did for the same intent e∣specially lately passe with a small Scullers boate into five great Rivers of this Kingdome; for the which in∣tent, (to beare charges) I procured divers of my friends to subscribe to severall Bills, for them to pay
<PB REF="6"/>me some severall small summes of money, upon my delivery to each of them a booke at my returue of the passages and entertainements which I had in my journey; which booke this is, which you are now reading, and how I past out and came backe againe, with many occurrences that happened I have truely related as followeth.</P>
<P>On the twentieth day of <HI>Iuly</HI> last, 1641. (the second day of the dogged Dogdayes (I with my two men and a brace of boyes were embarqued with a Scul∣lers boate first from <HI>London,</HI> and within halfe a quar∣ter of an houre after, I past from my house neare the Beares Colledge on the Banckside, I tooke leave of some friends, and had a flagge advanced as a token of my publike departure; but some enemies gave out that I was Runne away, who I doe know (since my re∣turne,) to be a crew of malicious <HI>Vermin,</HI> (that still being the most auntient name of their Captaine and leader,) on the day afforesaid with many stops, stayes, and taking leaves, wee gat to <HI>Oatlands</HI> at night, and lodged at <HI>Weybridge</HI> at the signe of the sixe <HI>Ankers.</HI> The next day, being wendnesday I strived against the streame as farre as <HI>Great Marlow,</HI> in <HI>Bucking hamshire,</HI> where I Lodg'd at the signe of the Crowne. Thurse∣day the 22. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> I past (with much toyle) from <HI>Marlow</HI> to <HI>Goring;</HI> and the next day I came to <HI>Abing∣ton.</HI> If it be demanded why I was so may dayes in pas∣sing 130 miles, I answer that the River (by reason of a great drought) wanted water in may places, so that wee were forc'd to wade, and leade or hale the boate
<PB REF="7"/>divers times, and moreover we did pull the said Boate over or thorough 14. Locks, besides many other im∣pediments, which hindred our passage.</P>
<P>As farre as above <HI>Stanes</HI> (which is forty miles by water from <HI>London,</HI> The River <HI>Thames</HI> is by the care and providence of the Lord Mayor well conserved and kept from impediments of Stops, Weares, Sand beds and other hindrances of passages of eyther Boates or Barges, and from <HI>Stanes</HI> to the furthest part almost there is no stoppage (but only Weares, which Weares have Lockes to open and shut for the pas∣sing to and fro of all manner of vessells (passable tho∣rough from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford;</HI> betwixt which Cities the Barges doe draw up nineteene of those Lockes with engines (like Capstanes) which are called <HI>Crabbs.</HI> I doe relate this heare, because the Reader may by that which followeth understand, that though Weares be necessary in Rivers, yet they ought not to stop up all passages, but to suffer Lockes to be opened and shut as <HI>Thames</HI> hath.</P>
<P>Thurseday the twenty seaven, I passed with my Boate from <HI>Abington</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I was well en∣tertained with good cheere and worshipfull compa∣ny at <HI>Vniversity Colledge;</HI> The next day I passed to a place called <HI>Bablack Hive</HI> (or <HI>Hithe.</HI>) And on Thurse∣day the twenty nine, I passed by <HI>Lechlad,</HI> and came to <HI>Creeklad;</HI> This towne of <HI>Creeklad</HI> is five miles di∣stant by land from <HI>Ciciter,</HI> but it is easier to row sixtie miles by water on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> then it is to passe betweene those two townes, for there are so
<PB REF="7"/>many milles, fords and shallowes with stops, and o∣ther impediments that a whole daies hard labour with my selfe and foure more could neyther by toyle or Art get but to a Mill of one Master <HI>Hortones</HI> at a place called <HI>Suddington,</HI> a mile short of <HI>Ciciter,</HI> so that ac∣cording to land measure we went but foure miles in a long dayes travell. The last of <HI>Iuly</HI> I left <HI>Suddington</HI> Mill, with the honest welcome of the Miller and his wife, and with much a doe for want of water I gatt to <HI>Ciciter,</HI> where the River was so dry that it would beare my boate no further; at the hither end of that Towne there stands a great Barne belonging to one <HI>Cooke,</HI> of whom I hired a Waine, wherein I put my Boate my selfe and my Men, Boyes and luggage, this Waine did in lesse then five houres draw me from the River <HI>Isis</HI> neere <HI>Ciciter,</HI> to a brooke called <HI>Stroud,</HI> which booke hath it's head or Spring in <HI>Bessley</HI> Hundred neere <HI>Misserden</HI> in <HI>Cotswould</HI> in <HI>Glostershire,</HI> (<HI>Stowd</HI> and <HI>Churne</HI> might be cut into one, and so <HI>Severne</HI> &amp; <HI>Thames</HI> might be made almost ioyned friends) are within 4. miles of <HI>Churne,</HI> which hath its first spring nere <HI>Cober∣ley,</HI> 7. miles from <HI>Glocester</HI> &amp; falles into <HI>Isis</HI> about <HI>Laech∣lad,</HI> so that 4 miles cutting in the Land betwixt <HI>Churne</HI> and <HI>Stroud,</HI> would be a meanes to make passages from <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Severne,</HI> to <HI>Wye,</HI> to both the Rivers of <HI>Avon</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and to one River of <HI>Avon</HI> in <HI>Monnouthshire,</HI> which falles into the River of <HI>Vske</HI> neere <HI>Cirlion</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> By which meanes goods might be conveyed by water too &amp; from <HI>London,</HI> in Rivers at cheape rates without danger, almost to half the countyes in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>and <HI>Wales.</HI> But there is a devill or two called <HI>sloth</HI> and <HI>covetuousnesse,</HI> that are the bane of all good en∣deavours and laudable Actions, but more of this shall be said hereafter.</P>
<P>I being vncarted (with my boate) at a place called <HI>Stonehouse,</HI> in the Afforesaid brooke called <HI>Stroud,</HI> with passing and wading, with haling over high bankes at fulling milles (where there are many) with plucking over suncke trees, over and under strange Bridges of wood and stone, and in some places the brooke was scarce as broad as my Boate, I being oftentimes im∣peached with the bowghes and branches of willowes and Alder Trees, which grew so thicke, hanging over and into the brooke, so that the day light or Sunne could scarce peepe through the branches, that in many places all passages were stop'd; so that I was some times forced to cut and hew out my way with a hatchett; with this miserable toyle all the day I gat at night to a Mill called <HI>Froombridge Mill,</HI> whereas (for our comfort) was neither Victualing house, meate, drinke or lodging, but that a good gentlewoman, one Mistris <HI>Bowser,</HI> there did comiserare our wants, and though she were not accustomed to victuall or lodge Travellers, yet the rarety of our boate, and strangenes of my adventure moved her so farre that shee at an casie rate did furnish us with good dyet, my selfe with a bed in an out-house, and my men and boyes with a sweet new mowed and new made hayloft.</P>
<P>I am much ingaged to a gentleman (one Master <HI>Iohn Stephens,</HI>) whose worthy father <HI>Nathaniell Ste∣phanes</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>Esquire) is one of the Knights of the Shire for the County of <HI>Glocester,</HI> in this Honorable and high Court of Parliament. To this House at <HI>Estington</HI> (corruptly called <HI>Eston</HI>) I was invited from the Mill with my company, where we both at dinner and sup∣per had welcome and good entertainement on Sun∣day the first of <HI>August.</HI> I doe further acknowledge my gratitude, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Master <HI>Mew</HI> the Minister there, both for his Spirituall paines taking, twice the said Saboth, and and also I thanke him for other courtesies which hee bestowed on me.</P>
<P>Munday the second of <HI>August</HI> I tooke my leave at <HI>Froombridge Mill,</HI> and (falling to our old worke againe of haleing and draweing from Mill to Mill, and from one hindrance to another, I came at last to <HI>Whitmister,</HI> where after I had plucked my boate over, I with my <HI>Murnivall</HI> of followers were stayed at the command of a worthy Gentleman named Master <HI>Thomas LLoyd,</HI> to whose house neere there we went upon small intreat∣ty, whence my sudden entertainement was so freely generous as might have beseemed the persō of a good Knight or Esquire. The said gentleman went with me to the brookes mouth, and saw me entred into the River of <HI>Severne,</HI> where (with thankes) I tooke my leave of him, and in two or three howers space I swom up the <HI>Severne</HI> to the ancient Citie of <HI>Glocester,</HI> where I was borne, and where by reason of almost fifty yeares absence I was scarce knowne. But the right worshipfull <HI>Thomas Hill</HI> Esquire, Mayor of <HI>Glocester</HI> gave me noble entertainement, and invited mee and
<PB REF="9"/>my servants to his house: the next day at dinner, and afterwards about three in the afternoone, he came to the key at the River side, where I entred my boate and tooke leave of him, &amp; went to <HI>Tewxbury</HI> being (some twelve miles by water that night, the fourth of <HI>August</HI> I past by the citie of <HI>VVorcester</HI> up the River to <HI>Bewdley,</HI> where I lodged at the signe of the <HI>Pyde Bull;</HI> The third of <HI>August,</HI> I went from <HI>Bewdley</HI> (being an ex∣treame rainy day) and that night approaching I saw a faire house belonging to a Knight named Sir <HI>VVil∣liam VVhitmore,</HI> thither I went and demanded of some of his servants whether lodging might bee had for money, where a poore man did answer, that if I would but crosse the River with him, and goe but halfe a mile up a hill, I should have the best entertainement his poore cottage could afford, and necessity having no law, I accepted willingly;</P>
<P>And surely that faire house I last spake of, was of a strange operation, for I was wet to the skinne when I went thither, and in lesse then halfe a quarter of an houre I came away as dry as ever I was in my life; this is a misterie or a Riddle, for I saw not the butler.</P>
<P>The sixt of <HI>August</HI> I past thorough many sharpe streames, fords, and shallowes to a place called <HI>Coond∣lane-end,</HI> where I lodgd at a Smiths, it being the one and only house there</P>
<P>The seventh of <HI>August</HI> (being Saterdy) I arived at <HI>Shrosebury,</HI> where I tooke harbour at one <HI>Luckmans</HI> house upon the lower bridge, in the afternoone I went to the Major <HI>Thomas wingfield</HI> Esquire, he bad me wel∣come
<PB REF="9"/>(but had no leasure to bid me drinke,) but he came from the Towne Hall with me to my lodging, and saw mee in my boate, and after∣wards with his hand and seale of his office, tooke his leave dryly of me. But Master <HI>Thomas Iones,</HI> an Alderman there, that had borne the office of a Bayliffe there, sixe times before <HI>Shrewesbury</HI> was a Mayor Towne, and (as I was informed hee was the first Mayor of that place, and he hath al∣so beene high Sheriffe of the County of <HI>Salop</HI> (or <HI>Shropshire</HI>) that Gentleman invited mee to dine with him on munday the ninth of <HI>August,</HI> where there was no want of good company, fish, flesh, foule, venison, wine, and welcom.</P>
<P>That afternoone I left <HI>Shewesbury,</HI> and retur∣ned downe the River twelve miles by water to <HI>Coonde-lane-end,</HI> where I lodged at my old Hosts the Smiths house.</P>
<P>The tenth of <HI>August</HI> I came to the Citie of <HI>Worcester,</HI> where the Right worshipfull <HI>William Norris</HI> Esquire, Mayor there made me extraor∣dinarily welcome, giving his testimoniall under his hand and seale of Mayoraltie, that I was there with my boate.</P>
<P>Wendnesday the eleventh of <HI>August</HI> I retur∣ned to <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where I was well entertained at a venison feast, by the right Worshipfull Master Mayor and his Bretheren. And presently (after dinner) I tooke boate and left <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and past
<PB REF="10"/>downe the River 12. miles to a place called <HI>Gat∣combe,</HI> there I stayed while such time as the tyde would serve me towards <HI>Brystow,</HI> (which was a∣bout midnight,) But one Master <HI>Hooper</HI> that dwells there, being a very good Seaman, did give me good instructions and directions to a∣voyde many dangers in that nightly passage, be∣sides I followed the tract of a boate laden with fruit which was bound for <HI>Bristow,</HI> so that after all nights labour amongst rockes and perrilous deepes, whirling Gulfes and violent streames, a∣bout the Breake of day, on Friday the 13 of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI> I came to <HI>Kingroad,</HI> and staying there a while for the flood, I past up that River of <HI>Avon</HI> at <HI>Hungroad</HI> by <HI>Crockhampill,</HI> and by nine of the clock in the forenoone I came to the rich and fa∣mous City of <HI>Bristoll.</HI></P>
<P>My entertainement there I will set downe in briefe, which was by the Right Worshipfull <HI>Iohn Taylor</HI> Esquier Mayor, a Gentleman en∣dowed (by the bounty of Heaven) both with right and left hand blessings, on Sunday the fifteenth of <HI>August</HI> my selfe and followers were his invited guests twice: and the next day hee gave mee a Certificate under hand and seale of my Arivall at that Citie, and at my taking leave of him (he knowing that travell was chargeable) did discharge a peece at me, and I unfearefull of the shott, did put it up most thankfully; my
<PB REF="10"/>humble thankes to my Cosin Master <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> at the Marsh there, whose friendship and favour I cannot requit or forget.</P>
<P>On the sixteenth of <HI>August</HI> I departed from <HI>Bristoll,</HI> towards the Citie of <HI>Bath,</HI> which is ten miles distant by land, and neere seventeene by water, which with passing by water over foure or five Milles and Weares, I attained to, at which Citie of <HI>Bathe</HI> I stayed two nights, being wel∣come to the Right Worshipfull Master <HI>Mathew Clift</HI> Mayor, with good entertainement from him &amp; some other Townesmen, I tooke his hand and seale of Mayoraltie for my Certificate, and so returned to <HI>Bristoll</HI> againe on wednesday the eighteenth of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>The nineteenth of <HI>August,</HI> at midnight I left <HI>Bristoll,</HI> and with the tyde past downe the River into <HI>Kingroad,</HI> where I lay at the Hole mouth (as they call it) till the flood came, and day light beginning to appeare, with the same tyde I past the broad water twelve miles to the River of <HI>Wye</HI> in <HI>Monmouth</HI> shire; that day I past by <HI>Cheapstow,</HI> by the old Abbey of <HI>Tinterne,</HI> and to litle <HI>Tin∣terne</HI> where I lay all that night, in a very cleane∣ly wholsome welch <HI>English</HI> Alehouse. The twenty one I came to <HI>Monmouth</HI> (the shire Towne of that Countrey) where one Master <HI>William Guilliam</HI>) did give me such entertaine∣ment at his house (on Sunday the twenty two
<PB REF="11"/>of <HI>August</HI>) as I am bound gratefully to remem∣ber.</P>
<P>Munday the twenty three of <HI>August,</HI> I left <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and (with a vvhole dayes labour by vvater) according to the miles by land) I got not a foote of ground; for at night when I came to a place called <HI>Lidbrooke,</HI> I was twelve miles from <HI>Hereford,</HI> and I was but twelve miles from the said Citie vvhen I vvas in the morning at the Tovvne of <HI>Mounmouth,</HI> this doth shevv that the River of <HI>Wye</HI> doth runne a little crooked from <HI>Lidbrooke.</HI> I vvent (on Saint <HI>Bartholomewes</HI> day) to the Tovvne of <HI>Rosse,</HI> vvhere I lodged nere <HI>Wilton</HI> Bridge there: and on the tvventie five I vvent to <HI>Foane Hope;</HI> and the tvventy sixe day about tenne of the clocke I gat to the Citie of <HI>Hereford,</HI> vvhich vvas the last place and the end of my painefull travell, Ioruney, Voyage, Perambulation, and Peregrination, or vvhat you please to call it; At <HI>Hereford</HI> I vvas invited to three severall places to dine on the friday, and I being not able to satisfie them all, gave them all the slippe, the three places vvere <HI>Edmond Ashton</HI> Esquire Mayor, the second the <HI>Vicars</HI> at the Min∣ster or Colledge; thirdly, at a Taverne vvith diverse Gentlemen, but I having gotten the Mayors hand &amp; seale, because I could not please all, left all, and stole avvay like a true man, leaving my thankes for Master Mayor, and Master <HI>Phil∣lip
<PB REF="11"/>Traherne,</HI> vvith all the rest, for their kindnesse to me the day before.</P>
<P>At my being at <HI>Hereford</HI> I vvas in a quandary or brovvne studdy, vvhether it vvere best to sell my boat, &amp; returne to <HI>London</HI> by land, or else to bring the boate home againe either by land or vvater, or both, or how I could: at last I determined &amp;. resolved to bring the monumentall vessell backe againe, vvhich I did as follovveth.</P>
<P>On friday the 27. of <HI>August</HI> I passed dovvne the River of <HI>Wye</HI> to a place called <HI>Inckson Weare,</HI> vvhere, vvith great entertainement and vvelcom I vvas lodged and my men also at the house of one Master <HI>Aperley,</HI> dvvelling there, to vvhom (for many) favours I doe acknovvledge my selfe to bee extraordinarily beholding. And on the Saterday I came to <HI>Lidbrook</HI> to my former Hoste Master <HI>Mosse,</HI> where understanding and knowing the passage down <HI>VVye</HI> and up <HI>Severne</HI> to be very long &amp; dangerous (especially if stormye weather should arise, the boate being split, torne &amp; shaken that she did leake very much) these things consi∣dered, &amp; that I was within five miles of <HI>Severne</HI> by land to <HI>Newnham,</HI> and that by water thither there was no lesse then 50 miles, I hired a Wayne frow <HI>Lidbrook</HI> to <HI>Newnham.</HI> And on Munday the 30. of <HI>August</HI> I past up <HI>Severne,</HI> by <HI>Glocester</HI> (and working all night) came in the morning betimes to <HI>Tewxbury,</HI> into another River called <HI>Avon,</HI> which by thegreat charge and industry of Master
<PB REF="12"/><HI>Sands</HI> is made Navigable, many miles up into the Countrey. Tuseday the 31 of <HI>August</HI> I came to a Market Towne in <HI>VVorcestershire</HI> called <HI>Per∣shore.</HI> On the first of <HI>September</HI> I came to the Aun∣cient Towne of <HI>Evesholm</HI> (corruptly called <HI>E∣sham</HI>) and seeing that River to bee further and further out of my way home, I hired another Wayne from <HI>Esham</HI> to <HI>Burford,</HI> where I found a crooked brooke called <HI>VVindrush,</HI> in which brooke (after one nights lodging) with my ap∣pendixes having taken each of us a Burford bait, we passed many strange letts and hindrances in∣t othe River of <HI>Isis</HI> or <HI>Thames:</HI> Againe at <HI>New∣bridge</HI> 12. or 14. miles from <HI>Oxford</HI> by water. By which Vniversity I past to <HI>Abingdon.</HI> The fourth of <HI>September,</HI> where I stayed till Wednesday the eight day: from thence was I with my boate at home on the Friday following And thus in lesse then twenty dayes labour 1200. miles were past to and fro in most hard, difficult and many dan∣gerous passages, for the which I give God most humble and hearty prayse and thankes; and now I crave the Readers patlence a little whilst I briefely treate of a few things that may bee pro∣fitable as well as pleasant.</P>
<P>I have before related of certaine stops, milles, and wares that doe hinder the passages of boates of <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Isis,</HI> now I will treate a little of the abuses and uses of other Rivers.</P>
<P>As for the River of <HI>Severne,</HI> it is almost as much
<PB REF="12"/>abus'd as us'd, for an instance, there are Coale∣mines neere it, and by the benefit of that River, mane a hundred family is served with suficient fewell at cheape rates, but some of those Cole∣mines doe yeeld neere 1000 tunnes of Rubbish yearely, which by reason of the neerenesse of the River is all washed into it, and makes so many shallowes, that in time <HI>Severne</HI> vvill bee quite choaked up, and all passage stopped, but of that River more at the conclusion.</P>
<P><HI>Avon</HI> River, that serveth <HI>Bristoll</HI> would also be made to serve <HI>Bathe,</HI> and many other parts and places, if <HI>Lockes</HI> were made at west <HI>Hanham</HI> weare, and at <HI>Kenisham,</HI> (with 4. or 5. places more) for the River doth offer Gods blessing to the peoples mouthes, if they would but open their lippes to receive them.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Wye</HI> is debard of all passages with Boates, by 7. Weares, 2. of them are <HI>Monmouth</HI> Weare, &amp; <HI>Wilton</HI> Weare, the other 5. are <HI>Inkson</HI> Weare, <HI>Carow, Founehope, Hancocks</HI> and <HI>Bondnam</HI> Weare, these seven weares (like the seven dead∣ly sinnes) doe dam up all goodnesse that should come from <HI>Monmouth</HI> to <HI>Hereford</HI> by water, and if the yron milles in the forrest of <HI>Deane</HI> doe eate up all the wood there (as it hath already done reasonably well and ill) within these few yeares, if the passages be stopt with Weares that coales cannot be carried by water to <HI>Hereford</HI> and ma∣ny other places, it is to be feared that many rich
<PB REF="13"/>men will bee glad to blow their fingers ends in the Winter through want of fiering, and num∣bers of poore will perish with extreame cold; the complaints and cryes are grievous already; which if I had not heard and seene I would not have beleeved: and 7. lockes at those Weares would helpe all and hinder nobody, or else onely two Lockes would doe much good, the one at <HI>Monmouth</HI> Weare, &amp; the other at <HI>Wilton,</HI> which is but eight miles from <HI>Hereford,</HI> and good vvay by land, for the carriage of any thing that might be brought by vvater.</P>
<P>For the other Kiver <HI>Avon,</HI> it comes from be∣yond the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and running by the Tovvnes of <HI>Stretford, Evesholme,</HI> and <HI>Pershore,</HI> it falles into <HI>Severne</HI> at <HI>Tewexbury,</HI> so that <HI>Gloucester∣shire</HI> (my native Countrey) is encompast round vvith Navigable Rivers, of vvhich Citie and Countrey I vvill speake a little for Countries sake, but most of all for love I beare to truth and Charity.</P>
<P>Records and Histories doe make trve relation of the antiquity of the Citie of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> that it vvas built by <HI>Arviragus</HI> (a Brittaine King) in the time of <HI>Claudus Tiberius Caesar,</HI> The said <HI>Claudius</HI> being the <HI>Roman Emperour,</HI> and commander of the vvhole World; in vvhose Raigne our bles∣sed Saviour suffered; King <HI>Arviragus</HI> and <HI>Lucius</HI> (the first Christian King doe lye there buried: vvhen the <HI>Saxons</HI> had the rule and domination
<PB REF="13"/>here in the raigne of <HI>Vier Pendragon</HI> and the renow∣ned worthy King <HI>Arthur,</HI> that City and County had a Duke, a Bishop, and a Major; aboue 1100 yeares past, their names were <HI>Edell, Eldadus,</HI> and <HI>Eldor,</HI> the shire is divided in 33. Hundreds, of which the Citie it selfe is one, and two Hundreds more named <HI>Kings Burton</HI> and <HI>Dunstone,</HI> with 30. Townes and Villages are annexed to the said Citie; which is all under the commande of the Major and his brethren. It hath beene anciently famous for the Trade of Merchandi∣sing, (now altogether decayed, the more is the pitty) King <HI>Henry</HI> the third was Crowned there the 28. of <HI>October</HI> 1216. there hath been many Dukes &amp; Earles of <HI>Glocester</HI> since the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest, as first <HI>Robert fittz Hamon,</HI> second <HI>William de Mondevill,</HI> third <HI>Robert de Millent,</HI> which Robert was taken prisoner &amp; was ex∣changed for King <HI>Stephen,</HI> the said King being then taken prisoner by <HI>Maude</HI> the Empresse) the fourth Earle of <HI>Glocester,</HI> was <HI>William</HI> sonne to the said <HI>Robert,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> was buried at <HI>Kinsham</HI> 1183. <HI>Iohn</HI> (who was afterwards King of <HI>England</HI>) was the third Earle of <HI>Glocester,</HI> the sixt was <HI>Almerick Mount∣fort,</HI> buried at <HI>Keinsham.</HI> Sixt <HI>Geoffery de mandevile,</HI> he was slaine at a Tilting or Tournament 1216.

And so much (though much more might be said for the honour of <HI>Glocester</HI> and Glocestershire.</P>
<P>That commerce and Trade is the strength and sin∣newes of the common wealth, the chiefe and onely subsistance of Cities and Corporations, it is appa∣rently evident. And the greatest honour and glory of Kingdomes, &amp; the reasons why severall meanes there are that brings wealth and honour to a citie, all of them put together in one ballance, and the trade of Merchandising in the other, it shall overprize them al, upon it alone hangs and depends almost all other trades, it brings great wealth and honour to all places where it is prosecuted with successe. Witnesse that of <HI>Leogorne,</HI> which within this 30. or 40. yeares was but a poore fishing towne which by that trade alone is now the greatest Mart of the <HI>Medeterenian</HI> Seas. As likewise the Low-countries, although they cannot
<PB REF="14"/>build a ship, but must fetch the materials from 6. seve∣rall kingdomes, yet they build and have more ships then all Christendome besides, &amp; have not any thing almost of a naturall staple commodity to deale upon, yet by that trade alone they have ingrossed the grea∣test part of the trade, of the Christian World to thē∣selves; &amp; some of them (if they please) may be gaineful in the trade of merchandising there. Now that the Citie of <HI>Glocester</HI> is scituated in as convenient a place as any other within this Kingdome, the reasons fol∣lowing shall demonstrate. First the said Citie hath beene an auncient Port towne, graced &amp; infranchesed with priviledges as ample as <HI>London,</HI> or any other citie or Towne within this Kingdom, &amp; dignified with the title of the 3. son of the Kings, and hath beene famous in former ages for the trade of Merchandizing now altogether decayed; And is likewise situated in as rich a soyle as any in this Kingdome, whose Markets are alwaies stored with abundance &amp; varieties of all com∣modities that the kingdome of <HI>England</HI> affords, inci∣dent to the life and being of man. And it is likewise situated in as convenient a place for any trade of Merchandizing being upon the famous River of <HI>Se∣verne,</HI> then which there is not any more miles Navi∣gable within this Kingdome, &amp; also the River of <HI>Avon</HI> being made Navigable with in foure miles of <HI>Warwick</HI> which standeth in the heart and center of the said Kingdome, having both the said Rivers, the advantage of all opportunities both for exportation &amp; importa∣tion of all goods and commodities whatsoever into
<PB REF="15"/>and from at least a third part of the said Kingdome, &amp; which parts vents as many forraine commodities and yeelds as many varieties of commodities as any o∣ther part of the said Kingdome doth. And which said parts cannot bee served by or from any other parts; then by the said Rivers unlesse they will fetch &amp; bring their commodities over the land three or foure score miles at a great charge, which cannot bee conceived they will doe, if it may be brought home to their doores by water; the said Citie having by speciall grant under the Great Seale, a spatious and conve∣nient Key or Wharfe built of stone neare the Kings Custome-house upon the said River, at which Key or Wharfe the Sea doth in its due course continually ebbe and flow for the bringing in and out of ships, and other boates of convenient burthen, so that a ship of a hundred and fifty tunne, or thereabouts, may at eve∣ry tide come to <HI>Gatcombe,</HI> which is but 12 miles from <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and therelye secure, and the River of <HI>Wye</HI> runneth into the <HI>Severne</HI> tenne miles above <HI>Kingrode,</HI> where ships of two or three hundred Tunnes may lye secure and safe.</P>
<P>And I have observed, that the trade that <HI>Bristoll</HI> driveth up to the city of <HI>Gloucester:</HI> and beyond it, in small Barkes hoighes and Trowes, is at the least two hundred Tunnes of all commodities, every spring, which is every fortnight or lesse. And it is conceiued and more then probable, that if the said trade of Merchandizing were settled within the said City of <HI>Cloucester,</HI> (as heretoforeit hath beene) that neither
<PB REF="15"/>the trades men of the said City of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> nor others that live three or foure score miles above it, will goe downe to <HI>Bristoll,</HI> and may have their com∣modities in <HI>Gloucester,</HI> for divers Reasons and incon∣veniences that may thereby happen.</P>
<P>As first it saveth threescoure miles riding in a dirty Countrey, next the ventring of their goods from <HI>Bristoll</HI> to <HI>Gloucester</HI> by Water, sometimes cast away, sometimes (the spring not serving) they are benept, and so cannot have their commodities to serve their turne, but usually much abused by Trow-men, so that many that live up the River beyond <HI>Gloucester,</HI> are thereby greatly discouraged, and doe many times buy their commoditys at <HI>London, Souththampton, Hull,</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> and so bring it home by land three or fourescore miles at a great charge, which if the trade were settled at <HI>Gloucester</HI> they would not doe, for which Reasons aforesaid and many other that might be alledged, it hath caused divers men well skilled and versed in the said trade of Merchandizing, much to wonder that the said trade hath beene so long neg∣lected, many of which hath concluded that the said City of <HI>Gloncester</HI> with the said key and havens, and the Kings custome house thereunto, doe lye as conve∣nient for the said trade of Merchandizing, as any other City or Towne within this kingdom, and might drive the greatest trade of any other (<HI>London</HI> only excepted.) For this City of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> stands almost within (or neere) the Center of this kingdome, and for exporta∣tion and Importation, of all Native and forraigne
<PB REF="16"/>commodities (by Reason of the riches of the soyle) and Commodiousnesse of the Adiacent Rivers, it is com∣parable to any place, except the Metropolis <HI>London.</HI> The village of <HI>Galcombe</HI> being at first built for the trade of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> (most commodious.) Now forasmuch as it may be objected, that the River of <HI>Seavern</HI> is dange∣rous, I must confesse it is so to those that know it not; and through want of practise (whereby experience showeth) but to those that know it, noe danger at all. For there is not one Barge in twenty that hath beene cast away, but it hath been by the owners covetousnes in loding too deep, or venturing too rash upō the tide, for feare they should be be kept, &amp; so loose the spring, all which with a certaine trade up and downe the Ri∣ver might wisely be prevented; All other difficulties that can or may be alledged, are of small consequence to hinder, if men of meanes and ingenious spirits doe undertake it. The reason aforesaid hath induced some men well affected to the publike good, and welfarre of this City, to endeavour a beginning of this most ho∣nourable action, and were they seconded with that in∣couragement from others, which if they were as wil∣ling, as every way able, both with their place and meanes, The necessity of this cause so earnestly requi∣ring it, the necessity of this cause (I say) so greatly moveing it, there is no doubt but by the blessing of the Almighty, and that in a short time it might raise the ruines of the decayed trade of this City, so much complained of by all, and make it as honourable as now it is contemptible, which is &amp; shal be the dead∣ly
<PB REF="16"/>prayers and desires of him, who presenteth this Hoping that no Churlish <HI>Naball,</HI> Mallicious <HI>Sanballar,</HI> corrupted <HI>Tobiah,</HI> proud <HI>Haman,</HI> unmercifull <HI>Dives,</HI> or any of the deadly sinnes, can or shall hinder so good a worke.</P>
<LG>
<L>FOr who can (but with pittie) here behold</L>
<L>These multitudes of mischiefes manifold,</L>
<L>Shall Rivers thus be barr'd with stops and locks,</L>
<L>With Mills, and Hills, with gravels beds, and rocks:</L>
<L>With weares, and weedes, and forced Islands made,</L>
<L>To spoyle a pulique for a private Trade?</L>
<L>Shame fall the doers, and th' Almighties blessng</L>
<L>Be heap'd upon their heads that seeke redreffing.</L>
<L>Were such a businesse to be done in Flanders</L>
<L>Or Holland mongst the industrious Netherlanders,</L>
<L>They to deepe passages would turne our hils,</L>
<L>To Windmills they would change our watermils.</L>
<L>All helps unto these rivers they would ayd,</L>
<L>And all impedunents shall be destroyed:</L>
<L>Our vagabonds (the wandring brood of Caine,)</L>
<L>They would inforce those runna gates take paine,</L>
<L>Whereby much profit quickly would accrue,</L>
<L>(For labour robs the hangman of his due.)</L>
<L>In common reason, all men must agree</L>
<L>That if these Rivers were made cleane and free,</L>
<L>One Barge, with eight poore mens iudustrious paines,</L>
<L>Would carry more than forty carts or waines.</L>
<L>And every waine to draw them horses five,</L>
<L>And each two men or boye to guide or drive.</L>
<L>Charge of an hundred horse and eighty men</L>
<L>With eight mens labour would be served then,</L>
<L>Thus men would be implovd, and horse preserv'd,</L>
<L>And all the Countrey at cheape rates be serv'd.</L>
<L>'Tis said the Dutchmen taught us drinke and swill,</L>
<L>I'm sure we goe beyond them in that skill,</L>
<L>I wish (as we exceede them in what's bad,)</L>
<L>That we some portion of their goodnesse had:</L>
<L>Then should this worthy worke be soone begun,</L>
<L>And with successefull expedition done?</L>
<PB REF="17"/>
<L>Which I dispaire not of, but humbly plead,</L>
<L>That God his blessings will increase and spread</L>
<L>On them that love this worke, and on their heires,</L>
<L>Their goods and chattels, and on all that's theirs?</L>
<L>I wish them blest externall, and internall,</L>
<L>And in the end with happinesse eternall.</L>

<P>In the most part of my Iourney, I came to few places but their was to be found plenty of beggers, or Doggmaticall, Scismaticall, full of Beggerly Rudiments, as the Apostle saith, <HI>Galathians.</HI> 4. Opi∣nionated divers wayes; and every one would have his owne fancy, to stand for his Religion; for they all dif∣fer one from another, yet all joyne against that which they have beene baptized and brought up in; In one place there is a blind old woman, and she repeates, and Interprets: in another a <HI>Pavier,</HI> and he will take upon him to mend the way. Then their is a Strange fellow (a <HI>Baker,</HI>) one light loafe and he will new bolt, sift, Knead, and mould Relligion. In another a <HI>quon∣dam</HI> Brewers Clearke, (would faine be a Priest) and Preaches most wonderfully in a mault house, besides a zealous Sowgelder, that professeth most desperate doctrine. Good Lord in thy mercy looke upon us, and give us true peace and unity, both in Church and Common wealth.</P>
