<HEAD>THE French Mountebank, OR An Operator fit for these Times.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Onducted by the hand of Providence, me arrived at <HI>Dover</HI> on the first of <HI>March,</HI> where me stayed two, tree, foure, and five dayes, exercising my faculty in a chari∣table way among tee poore Seamans, tee residue of tee time before I came to this renowned City, me spent for tee most part in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where by rea∣son of tee great confluence of People, me was forced to erect a Stage, whereon to preserve my own selfe from stifling, and the better to present my own selfe and my Rarities to the sight and view of the multitude. Yet for for all this me could take very little money. Me appear∣ed every day with my Dwarfe, my Hermaphrodite, and my Monkey, and entertained them <HI>all a mode de France,</HI> with Songs, Anticks, and Masques, yet all would not not doe, me could see but little money.</P>
<LG>
<PB REF="3"/>
<L>My selfe and my Hermaphrodite,</L>
<L>My Dwarf, and Monkey, all that night</L>
<L>Were very full of sorrow:</L>
<L>We did despaire</L>
<L>To take the ayre</L>
<L>In publike on the morrow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet once more we came forth againe,</L>
<L>And had our labour for our paine;</L>
<L>Though me pul'd out rare knacks,</L>
<L>All with one voice</L>
<L>Made a great noise,</L>
<L>And cri'd we were but Quacks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then down me laid my Velvet cloke,</L>
<L>And quickly pul'd out of my poke</L>
<L>Papers from sev'rall lands;</L>
<L>Where they did see</L>
<L>Wonders of me,</L>
<L>Confirm'd by thousand hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The silly people now beleeve,</L>
<L>And crafty me do laugh in sleeve,</L>
<L>To see them so soon taken:</L>
<L>They money bring</L>
<L>To buy each thing,</L>
<L>Besides Goose, Eggs, and Bacon.</L>
</LG>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P> When me had vented all my Commodities, it was not safe for me to stay long there, yet me be sure if tey do them no good, tey will do them no harme: And now me be newly come unto this famous City of London, and the City of London cannot but confesse themselves very much beholden to me, that after so many yeares travaile, and experience in severall Countries, both Chri∣stian, and Pagan, me be pleased now in these latter, and most knowing daies of mine, to leave wandring, and re∣side here with them.</P>
<P>The reason why me do shew mine selfe in print first is, because me be tickled in the conceit by some, that this is the best way to make my selfe known unto you, and the setting up of Bils upon Posts, is the tricks of tee Mountebanke, which me do abhorre.</P>
<P>Imprimis, me do meane to tell you what rare exploits me have done abroad.</P>
<LG>
<L>Me first in <HI>Paris</HI> up was bred,</L>
<L>A mender of the Maidenhead,</L>
<L>Where by mine Art I did restore,</L>
<L>The sound, and eke the Pocky Whore:</L>
<L>And so salve up Virginity,</L>
<L>That none could any fault espie.</L>
<L>This cal'd me out of <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>To stop up a new open'd Vein,</L>
<L>Me found the Lady sore, and Stradling,</L>
<L>Yet made her go quick, without wadling;</L>
<L>With promises to make me great,</L>
<L>She would have kept me for this Feat:</L>
<L>But me cri'd Madam pardon me,</L>
<L>For me be bound for <HI>Tartarie,</HI></L>
<L>In haste, to visit the great <HI>Cham,</HI></L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L> And rectifie his crooked Hamme,</L>
<L>Besides to shew a piece of Art,</L>
<L>Upon his <HI>Doxies</HI> lower part,</L>
<L>Me made their Tooles so well and right,</L>
<L>They got three Heires all in a night.</L>
<L>The next of my admired workes,</L>
<L>Was done among the cruell <HI>Turkes,</HI></L>
<L>Where to the Fame of me, and <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>Me mended up a sad mischance,</L>
<L>The broken necke me firme did set,</L>
<L>Of their then Emperour <HI>Mahomet,</HI></L>
<L>And once me rais'd from death to life,</L>
<L>With Cordials, the <HI>Grand-Seigniors</HI> wife.</L>
<L>Thence me came into <HI>Germanie,</HI></L>
<L>Where were as cunning Knaves as I,</L>
<L>Such tricks me saw, that me did feare,</L>
<L>Mine for that place too shallow were.</L>
<L>From thence to England me soone come,</L>
<L>And here intend to make my home.</L>
</LG>
<P>And now Dukes, Earles, Lords, Bishops, Knights, Deanes, Prebends, Gentlemen of Englant, &amp;c. and all others, High and Low, Rich and Poore, me do addresse mine selfe to you in all humility. For as much as me do understand that since this present Perliament, there hath been many strange and unheard of diseases, seizing upon certain sorts of People, that were in perfect health before, and as yet remaining incureable, me being accustomed to cure such diseases, do undertake these Maladies follow∣ing, and for my better proceeding in the cure when they come to my hands, me joyn to every Mallady some short directions for their observation. Though a Parliament (as me do know) be <HI>salus Populi,</HI> the best meanes conduce∣ing
<PB REF="4"/> to the health of this Nation, yet as in ill conditioned stomacks, oftentimes the best Cordials degenerate into an ill nature, and so become as offensive to the Body, as the ill humours themselves; even so this Parliament, (which God preserve) though as well a temper'd Cordiall for this languishing Kingdome as ever was, yet to some ill humoured Members it hath proved Feavourish, and set them all on Fire, as <HI>Iesuits, Papists,</HI> and <HI>Cavaliers:</HI> and to others as bad as poyson, as to <HI>Church▪Statists,</HI> and <HI>Mono∣polists,</HI> those Catterpillers of the Common-wealth, &amp;c. So then me being by my proffession to cure all diseases, must not be blamed, if me do name all indifferently, and me do see no reason why me should be blamed for name∣ing such of these diseases, which me do intend, and pro∣mise to cure, therefore <HI>Sans dissimulation,</HI> or Feare, me do proceed.</P>
<LG>
<L>Imprimis, once more; if you know</L>
<L>Of any Citizen does owe</L>
<L>More then he can pay,</L>
<L>Though broken-backt, me him assure</L>
<L>Me have a medicine will him cure,</L>
<L>Let him break word or day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is any Bishop with a paine</L>
<L>Much troubled in his head or braine,</L>
<L>And would be made lighter,</L>
<L>Me do suppose that the worst harme</L>
<L>Comes from his being kept too warme,</L>
<L>Let him throw off his miter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>Hath any been a great whore-master,</L>
<L>And in his age now wants a plaister</L>
<L>That will do the deed?</L>
<L>Hath any Madam caught the pox</L>
<L>By daily tribute to her box?</L>
<L>She need not purge or bleed:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She shall regain her credit well</L>
<L>If she observe what me do tell,</L>
<L>And then take what me give her:</L>
<L>No matter who dare to attaint her,</L>
<L>For there are wayes in age to Saint her,</L>
<L>Though ne're so lewd a liver.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is any troubled with sore eyes,</L>
<L>For losing of Pluralities?</L>
<L>Me have a good water:</L>
<L>To cool them, and a most rare pill</L>
<L>To purge the humours that are ill,</L>
<L>And feed the greedy matter.</L>
</LG>
<P>These and many more the Professour hereof will faithfully performe, he beeing but newly come to town you cannot expect much from him, till longer observa∣tion hath better acquainted him with the diseases now raging, and ranging in this Land.</P>
<P>If any desire to make use of him in any of these parti∣culars aforenamed, or to make known any other Mal∣ladie wherewith they are afflicted, let them repaire to the Physitiaus Colledge.</P>
<CLOSER>Vive Le Roy.</CLOSER>
