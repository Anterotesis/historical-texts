<HEAD>A LETTER Concerning, Some passages of the revolted SHIPS and the three Castles in KENT, a∣gainst the Ships sent with reliefe to the Protestants in IRELAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y last was of the 8 of this present from the Downs, since which time we have at∣tempted to put to sea, severall times, but was forc'st back thither again, by extra∣ordinary stormes, and crosse winds, by which we were all in some danger of the Kings ships, and the three Castles in the Downs, to bee stayed and plundered by them.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P> As for the Kings ships, they sent men aboard of all our three ships, to demand Powder and Ammunition for them and the Castles, and goe aboard of them, and to show their Bills of Laydings, and Letters, who affirmed they had none, nor any powder or ammuni∣tion, but for the use of their ships; whereupon they were threatned to be carried for Holland, unlesse they would confesse and deliver what was desired, never∣thelesse at the last all our Masters were released, and the Kings ships set sayle for Holland upon the 12 day to speak unto the Duke of York as they pretended.</P>
<P>And upon the 17 day the Castles sent severall men and boats aboard of all our ships, with order to search and plunder us, but being withstood they went ashore, and swore God damme them, they would goe ashore and sinke every ship of us, and in pursuit thereof they did their best indevours, by shooting 12 pieces of great Ordnance at the least, which forced us to weigh Anchor, and fall off to the Sea: Although the wind was contrary and calme, so that we lay at their mer∣cy, and in great danger, if we had not been timely relieved, by a good party of the Lord Generalls Ar∣my, that marched towards the severall Castles, and found them other imployment, which fell very hap∣pily out for us, for by this meanes we gained time to goe out of their command without any hurt or losse, onely Captain Newburts was plundered of two rich swords, worth five or six pound, as he affirmed, wee being thus forced to Sea, and the stormes arising con∣tinuing for the space of two dayes, did put our Ships in some danger, neverthelesse, thanks be to God, wee heat it out, and recovered this place the 20 day,
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>where we Ride safely in this Bay, ready for the first fair winde, which God in his mercy grant, and that with speed, for the Corn is very prout, and is in dan∣ger to be spoyled.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe nine ships in Holland, viz.) The Reformation, the Convertine, the Antelope, the Swallow, and the rest at Gorith that revolted from the Parlia∣ment of England, are making addresses to the Duke of Yorke, to joyn with them, and send them in provi∣sions, which they want, and are labouring for: But the Duke told them at present hee could not satisfie their desires, because of his want of monies, The falling off of those ships hath put the Navy much out of order, and makes other Sea-men tumultuous, and if some course be not taken to reduce them, I feare no Commander will bee safe in any ship except it please God that some way bee found out for agree∣ment between the King and Parlia. I pray God so to direct the Parliament to propound, and his Maje∣sties heart to incline to grant, that there may bee a
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>peace. Waymer Castle was stormed with some losse, It was thought Prince Charles would have been with Langdale in the North of England by this time, but monies comming not in as expected, it caused his stay to raise monies upon use. Captaine Crowders the Reare-Admiralls ship is to be rig'd before she can go out, God send a speedy and safe peace.</P>

<HEAD>The copy of a Letter from Dublin in IRELAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Enemies abroad are at great discord amongst themselves: and there is blood spilt, for they say that one Neale Mac Kenna a great man of the party of Owen Roe is slain: The Popes Nuntio hath excommunicated all the supreame Councel at Kil-kenny, and like∣wise Preston and his Army, and all that doth adhere unto him, and the cessation with Inchequeen: The supream Councell and Pre∣ston, and all their adherence protests against the Popes Nuntio his excommunication,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>and doth appeale to the Pope of Rome, and hath made a Declaration of all their reasons for their appeale, which Declaration and ap∣peale in Print I beleeve Col. Jones hath now sent into England: I assure you the Enemies are exceedingly out of heart, and the gene∣rality of the people desire a peace, and to be from under this Irish rebellious government for all sorts of people suffer extreamly in their estates: and hardly can support their fami∣lies: the Taxes and Levies being so exceed∣ing great: So that none gets by this warre, but the Popish Clergy, and the rascall rout, and men of broken fortunes, which lives by all robberies and stealths: There is a report here that the Marquesse Ormond is landed in Munster; this news comes out of the Irish quarters, but I doe hardly credit it to be true, Inchequins revolt hath for the present much supported the Irish, and prejudiced the Pro∣testant party in this kingdome: but I hope it will little availe them in the end: for if it please God to protect England from a new warre, and that the Parliament send over speedily in time; sufficient recruts of men,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>to go abroad into the field next Moneth. I doubt not by Gods help this Summer will finish the warre in this kingdome, Col. Jones and Col. Monks, agree and sement close to∣gether: and will hold firm and sure to the Parliament: they intend to joyne together as soon as possibly they may, to take the field Col. Moncks was here, and departed home ye∣sterday.</P>
<P>My Brothers Troop had a great losse last week in the County of Wicklow, for the ene∣my came suddenly over the place where their horses grazed, and took-away sixteen of the Horse, with one Graham, and Adam Loftus, that then kept the Horses at Grasse: I hope we shall get the two men to bee exchanged and brought home.</P>
