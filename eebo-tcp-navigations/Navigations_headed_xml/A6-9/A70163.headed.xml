<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>N Advertissement for men inclined to Plantations manifesting that greater profits are to bee donne in the hott then in the could parts off the Coast off <HI>America,</HI> (and which was printed att <HI>Rotterdam</HI> as appeares by the annexed) hath promissed this Summary Descrip∣tion / and the which was conceaved fitt to bee publisht with all due and zealous respects unto his <HI>Sacred Majesty,</HI> as att so greate incomparable an example (of his most extraordinary gratious care for the publicke good) all men are obliged to bee awake∣ned / and to offer (according unto theire tallent whatsoever may bee off use: And should not all men doe soe? then must every one bee an open

enemy to himselfe / as also onworthy that a Souverayne should (as to say) fatigate himselfe in seeking and pracktysing all advantages / whereby benefits may bee procured unto them / which hath so mani∣festly appeared <HI>as forrayne nations have not only admired his gracious bounty in the behalffe off his Loyall subjects, butt moved some to offer likewyse cer∣tayne expedients. Whereby his service and the good off his subjects may bee much advanced.</HI></P>
<P>The said beeing not only a manifest truth concerning forrayne Na∣tions in <HI>Europe,</HI> but a most remarcable one in the Inhabitants off the coast off <HI>America,</HI> who about the tyme of his <HI>Sacred Majestys,</HI> returning into England) when no Courriers nor weeckly Intelligencers could bring that happy neewes theire) exprest theire ressentments / which may well deserve to bee taken / notice off / as lickewyse that thy had the ty∣ding even in the month of May Anno <HI>1660.</HI> which the heavens must have brought unto them.</P>
<P>The said wilde (in name but nor wilde in nature for that thy are off a most milde disposition) said that thy could not endure those men whoe doe not love theire <HI>Anna Cajoury</HI> (which is to say king or Scheeff) butt bid wilcome all such as are true unto him bring them / refrechments off <HI>Annasses.</HI> And other fruites / as also <HI>Wilde deare, fish, and foule,</HI> besy∣des all what thy could finde in those parts which thy doe inhabite.</P>
<P>And as thy knowe that number off them are on the Hands of Bar∣bados / S. Christosters / as also on the same Coast of <HI>America</HI> as at <HI>Sarename,</HI> thy (for as much theire capacity makes them discusse mat∣ters) doe not a little wonder how such as leave the cold clyme in Euro∣rope will transporte themselves to the cold parts of <HI>America,</HI> and not preferre the hot where it never winters / and no fire needes to bee made but to boile theire fish and Crabs / and to coste wilde deere and foule.</P>
<P>That then the love off a Christian (for the advancement of the publick good) may not bee said to bee more could then the frozen Northeren cly∣me / nor the innocent <HI>Charibdiens</HI> reproache unto such a one (whoe thy have not fayled to visitte and to impart unto him what the hot parts off <HI>America</HI> is capable off) his want off charity. This Summary Descri∣ption must defend / and most seasonnably free frome desadvantagious explications on the fresh returne off a notable Equipage which in the yeare <HI>1659.</HI> hath been sent from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to the Coast of <HI>America,</HI> and that likewyse no men (sudued with comon Sence) may have any just cause to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doubt of the truth that this Description is wel grounded / it hath seemed necessary to hould forth the cause of the <HI>re in facta</HI> returne of that Equipage; and wy the men whoe were sent to that much more
<PB REF="3"/>
beneficiall hot part off <HI>America</HI> thou the cold did not settle theire / which though it should require every ample Description hath beene thought fit to contract in as seemlynes as possibly may bee / since it is but to serve as replaye unto the particular <HI>Quaeritur</HI> which may bee made con∣cerning the cause of such returne; yet must the sayd description bee taken frome the spring off the evill / <HI>the which proceded frome a hellish ambition off certayne Thrusties sent whith the afore said Equipage, and who before theire departure frome Texell conbyned against the cheeff Commandor and Patron off an intended Colonie to bee setled on the Coast off America. To ma∣ke them selves masters, so thy could dispocesse him, or distroy his persson and his familly, that theire might remayne no pretenders to the Land which he was to pocesse.</HI></P>
<P>Which conbination beeing discovred to the said cheefe Commandor <HI>Sir Balthazar Gerber,</HI> authorised by speciall commission off the Lords E∣states generall off the united Provinces / and off the West-Indian Com∣pany / obliged him (by the prime Law of <HI>selffe preservation,</HI> to defend him selffe (as much possibly hee could against such a damnable plot / which never oughst to have beene expected frome rationals / nor frome men to whome hee was a benefactor / and whoe would not have beene admitted without his consent).</P>
<P>Yet so farre had the spirrit off Diluzion charmed them as forgetting God / and the property off Human Soules / thy only represented to them selves (as the Phabulous <HI>Midas</HI>) tot choake them selves with Gold and Silver / and to runne head long to those parts were precious things are said to bee had; as also to meete with cheefs off famillies who might sheew them the way to <HI>el Dorado,</HI> and <HI>Manua.</HI></P>
<P>Thy thought on nothing elsse save to destroy theire cheeff Comman∣dor / and his familly / as <HI>Otto Keye</HI> the prime leader who could not so much as dissimule his murdering inclination / when as hee vented (before his departure from <HI>Texel) That hee wold make short worke with the Commandor, and his familly; and (beeing once sett on firme ground in America) either gett a golden fleece, or a rope about his necke) that hee would theirefore copulate with one off the cheef Indian his Daughter, and then kill him, to make him selffe master off all.</HI> So as killing and mur∣thering was the mayn delight and scope off this worsse then Barba∣rian disposition / as that off his choise fellow trustees.</P>
<P>In fyne / so as the evili begunne it was pursued; and never ceassed untill after the arrival of the Equipage on the Coast of America.</P>
<P>The Equipage did consist off three good Vessels / wel provided with all necessaryes / as Victuals / Amunition / Cargazoen / to Trafficke
<PB REF="4"/>
with: materialls / Ingredients to purge myneralls Toels to wor∣ke with / and to manuer the Land; One <HI>Rijnier Van Buren</HI> the Com∣missary off the Magazyn (a notable hellish monopollist) agitating (as inpudently and Inprudently sayd) according unto his secret in∣structions receaved before his departure frome Amsterdam to comby∣ne against the sayd Commandor resolved as Wel as the others after ha∣ving made use off severall stratagemes. to make an end off the sayd Commandor and off his harmlesse familly / remitting as his other fel∣low trustees the prosecution off the establishing off the Colonie / and all the mayne for the which the Equipage was sent untill thy should have performed theire bluddy worcke which thy compassed in part; as is particulaly mentionned in the afforesaid annexed advertissement; Whereby the <HI>Quaeritur</HI> concerning the <HI>reinfacta</HI> returne of the Equipagie is answeared / and may wel serve for an argument that the sand <HI>Sir Baltha∣zar Gerber</HI> could never have donne anny good with such men / who as thy minded but his extirpation / never suffered him after the arrivall off the Equipagie on the Coast off <HI>America</HI> to settle the intended Colonie / nor to repaire in persson n'ay not so much as to enquire after all such things where unto the Equipagie was sett forth / for thy thought to have gotten outt off him all what soever thy were to purchasse in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> and were confident enouff that theire was a fleece to bee had / butt thy would putt it into theire particular sack / for thy were not Ignorant that all the world hath spoken off <HI>El Dorado,</HI> and <HI>Manva,</HI> as credible men have publisht that <HI>Don Diego d'Ordas,</HI> Capitayn to <HI>Cortez,</HI> (whoe conquered <HI>Mexico</HI>) did discover richesses in the King dome off <HI>Guaiana,</HI> as <HI>Gaspar de Sylva,</HI> and <HI>Jean Gonzales</HI> did relate Wondrous things off that continent / soo have thy beene sought by <HI>Philip d'Uren, Pedro de Lympias, Geronimo d'Ortal, Ximenes,</HI> the brother off <HI>Ximena de Guesi∣da, Pedro d'Ossima</HI> and the monek <HI>Sala</HI> whoe braught cast golden Ai∣gles from thence</P>
<P>Therfore the said combinators kneew wel also / that it was sayd that when the <HI>Duke of Buckingham</HI> was attending the Prince of greate <HI>Bri∣tane</HI> att <HI>Madrid,</HI> one <HI>Don Anthonio Hennin,</HI> had (by <HI>Sir Balthazar Gerbeer,</HI> been examined / and Introduced to the sayd <HI>Duke,</HI> that the sayd <HI>Don Hennin</HI> produced the mynerall / which hee had braught frome <HI>America,</HI> and that the sayd mynerall did render a verry rich quantity off gold Thy kneew also (especially <HI>Otto Keye</HI> who had beene present att <HI>Delff</HI> when by the appointement off that Magistrat a proefe was made off the mynerall) That itt did render gold / and that it was off the
<PB REF="4"/>
same which in the yeare 1656 (in a Schip called <HI>the Liefde</HI>) was braught frome the coast off <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>But so greate theere uniust scope was as to mynde nought butt what might contribute to the rendring off them sole pocessors off all / and suffer themselves to bee persuaded to make use off anny falcehoods / whereby thy might disguise theire bluddy dessyne / and sent horride relations to theire confident Patrons / among whome theire is one whoe was not ashamed to boaste to have sayd to a Souverayne Prince that <HI>Sir Balthazar Gerber</HI> did not agree with theire Trustees: which iff hee had done by yeelding to theire intent (which was to distroy him and his Innocent familly) had beene a most barbarous resolution in him / and a shamefull sygne off weaknisse / As would at present ar∣gue no lesse incensibillity in him in casse hee should not (as a second <HI>Colomba</HI>) aquaint men capable off truth off the apparant good which may bee done in the hott parts off the <HI>American</HI> coast / and wherefore this Sommary description is putt forth / where off the particular an notations must bee on this Principle / <HI>That the profits to bee done in the hott parts off America are incomparably more then those which men inpru∣dently seeke in the cold,</HI> Which to prove on certayne grounds it wilbe best first to fix on a calculation concerning the charges which men who transporte them selves towards <HI>America</HI> must bee at / and therefore to specify a particular some off mony / which some have put forth on like occasion / As for example / that men who had bestowed one hundred and seventy nyne pounds / for theire necessary expences for theire trans∣portation / and the preparing off fit grounds in the cold part off <HI>America,</HI> had not (at the ende off a yeares turmoyle and Labour) advanced a bove three pound / which should seeme to bee almost In∣credible.</P>

<P>And is to be considered / that before anny profit can bee had In such a cold clyme (frome Lands that must bee prepared) two yeares Wilbe spent at the Least; for that those Lands (as Well as others) must bee cleered frome the Woods Which thy doe beare / the roets and stomps Wel removed.</P>
<P>That one man cannott cleere / prepare nor mannuer (during the ty∣me off a yeare) more then ten Akers of ground / consisting off six thou∣sand Rods.</P>
<P>So as a man must Weekly cleere / prepare and manuer about one hundred and fifty Rods / and / consequently dayly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ynthien Rods.</P>
<P>And whoe dayly shall cleere such a parcell off ground both off the Wood / roets / and stomps / must labour verry hard as Slaves doe.</P>
<P>Yett Were it so that in a yeares tyme a man could Infalibly prepare so much ground to make it fit for the Plowe. And that hee could reape some benefit there on in the second Yeare / yet must hee frome those ten Akers reserve two for haye / and grasse / for two horsses / and two kowes / Which scarcely Wilbee fedd / by reason off the difference off Lands neewly made / and those Which are troughly and fully groune.</P>
<P>So is it necessary to keepe two Akers of ground for grasse for the ko∣wes / and the two horsses / </P>
<P>So as off the ten Akers remaynes six to sowe / where of three may bee sowne with Wheate; one off the three others with Rye; the two other remayning with Barley / Oates / Pease / and Beanes / where off the Rye (growing uppon one off the Akers) wil bee necessary for
<PB REF="5"/>
the maintenance off the familly / since an Aker off good ground (which can bee sowne with one sacke of Rye) doth noth produce above sixteen sacks / which a familly (consisting off a man / woman / two strong labourers and children) Wil neede for a yeares tyme; As lickwyse the same familly shall neede the production off the two other Akers off ground / for housekeeping / the Barly for Beare / Pease / and Bea∣nes / for Salt Porc / and the Oates for Horsses.</P>
<P>The groathe off the remayning three Akers beeing reserved allone for the making good off the expences and the clering off debts made;</P>
<P>But there cannot bee gotten frome the said three Akers above fifty foure sacks off Corne.</P>
<P>Which (when all is considered) cannot yeeld more then the number off people theire can sett aprisse thereon / no advantage beeing to bee expected by transportation off Corne to other parts off the World / which needs not to send for Corne in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>So as when all what can bee done in the could clyme off <HI>America.</HI> (Beeing put together att the best) wil argue it to bee the worst which (men whoe seeke to make a fortune) can bee pitcht uppon in considera∣tion off the advantages too bee made in the hott clyme off that con∣tinent.</P>
<P>It wil be verry easy to all rationalls to graunt that the said hott cly∣me ought to bee preferred before the could / where the ground beares al the yeare long / because it never whiters theire / grapes culd all the yeare long frome the Stallee; as all other fruites. Cattel producing a∣bondantly; no such cost necessary as cloathe clothing (and other char∣geable defence) against the feercenisse off Winter season / and no such indisposition tormentig the boddyes of men as occasionned by could mists / piercing Windes / Hayles / Snowe / and hard frosts / etc.</P>
<P>All which is found to bee true / and not needing other tongues to speake it / nor pens to wryte it / then those off that people inhabitting the <HI>Charibdis</HI> Eylands / as likewyse <HI>Sarenamme,</HI> and <HI>Cajana,</HI> on the Coast of the firme Land off <HI>America</HI>; where (as is mentioned in the afore said annexed advertissemeut for men inclined to Plantations there) a most profitable settlement can bee made / and by the Service of Slaves (whoe neede no cloathis against the could / nor bedding / nor anny other such chargeable accommodations as a could Clyme doth require; from which hott clyme ready returnes of precious things can bee made wit∣hout the losse off two yeares tyme / as in the could clyme;</P>
<P>Were no such cost must bee bestowed for the buylding off houses for men / nor Stables and chargeable barrins for the placing off Cattell; for as the inhabitants (called the wilde thoug verry tame good people)
<PB REF="6"/>
will in feew dayes make a convenient habitation for one <HI>Axe, hatchet, and some knyffs,</HI> the Cattell lives all the yeare long in the open ayre.</P>
<P>The Slaves neede no clothis / and beeing once baught and payed are during all theire lyffe tyme workmen Without Wagers; when by one day free to themselves in the Weeke thy get theire one Living / and whoe doe more Worke (at there ease) then two Christians can performe / both in the manuering off the ground / and in digging off <HI>mynes.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is in the hot parts of <HI>America</HI> in the beginning off Plantations much Cattel necessary for houskeeping / and the Labouring of grounds / the greate aboundance off fruite considered: off fish / foule / and Wil be Deare / which all the yeare long is to bee had theire / Nor neede ha∣bitants furnish theire houses with such chargeable houshold stuff as thy must necessarily have in the could parts / nor bedding / nor Schee∣tes / for that in the hot parts a <HI>Hamack</HI> (to bee had for one hatchet) is the best bedd that can bee made usse off / both for the night / and for a fresh repose in the day tyme / </P>
<P>The difference off the profits which are to bee done on the commodi∣tyes which can bee gotten frome the sayd hot parts (and those which are gotten in the could) beeing as greate as the difference off the worth off them is / and were of anny understanding person can make the esti∣mate / especially such men whoe knowe what distinction theire is to bee made betweene precious things / or of greate exteeme / and ordinary commodityes / As the precious to bee had in the Hott parts of <HI>Ameri∣ca are Gould, Silver, Stonnes, of greate vallue, precious Woods, for all kinde of rare workes, for Dye, Collours, as Orian, Rocous for scarlet dye, and the Ultermarin, precious Balms, Armadac, Bolus, Cassia, rare Gu∣mes as Lemnae; sennement, which hath the Vigor off Cloves, bessydes Ho¦ny, cleere as Christal, and Wax, as theire hath beene found store off Nut∣megs with Mace about them; which though some men gathered during the rayny months, (that thy where as unrype Aprikoks fallen youngh to the ground)</HI> have taken to bee but Wilde / yet in all appearance (by reason of theire shape / colour / inward vaynes / and theire taste) may (beeing full growne and parfaict rype) prove to bee right / and of greate con∣cernment.</P>
<P>The soule (by reason off the degrees onder the which it Lyith / and the rayne which falls in the Season which in <HI>Europe</HI> is the winter / and yet in <HI>America</HI> continuall warme dayes) beares continuall / without Intermition / and in such a quantity as <HI>Jean Claasen Langendijck</HI> the Commandor in <HI>Cajana</HI> (five degrees by North the Lyne <HI>Equinoctiall</HI>) both assure / that certayne part off his most rocky grounds which had
<PB REF="6"/>
