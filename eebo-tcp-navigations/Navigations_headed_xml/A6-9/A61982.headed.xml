<P><HI>A Person</HI> of great Rank, that is of <HI>Italian</HI> ex∣traction, and that by consequence knows the <HI>Countrey</HI> well, having spent much of his time in it, bad heard that I was giving the World an account of the <HI>Reflections</HI> that I had made on <HI>the present State of Italy,</HI> and upon that he writ the following <HI>Paper</HI> to one of his Friends, to be communicated to me; for I have not the honour of any Commerce with himself: The <HI>Observations</HI> that he had made, a∣greed so exactly with my own, that I thought it would be no small Advantage towards the supporting the Cre∣dit of those that I had made, to find them confirmed by so extraordinary a <HI>Person,</HI> whose <HI>Character</HI> (as those who know him well have assured me) is so un∣disputed, that if I durst name him, this alone would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rve to establish the belief of the most <HI>critical</HI> parts of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Letters</HI> in the minds of all that should read his <HI>Paper:</HI> But since I cannot adventure on this, without <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>btaining his Leave, and since he is now at such a di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lance, that it is not easie to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Friend to write to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>im, or to receive an Answer from him time enough,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> therefore I have added this <HI>Memorial</HI> in the <HI>Lan∣guage</HI> in which he writ it. Which I thought fitter than to give a <HI>Translation</HI> of it into <HI>English.</HI> There are <HI>two</HI> Particulars in which He and I differ, and is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great a Variety of <HI>Observations,</HI> that are so <HI>Cri∣tical,</HI> and so much out of the Common road, it wil not appear strange, if there should be some disagree∣ment, when he mentions the <HI>Tax</HI> that the <HI>Pope</HI> has laid on the <HI>Corn;</HI> he does not add one thing which I mention, and that is, that the <HI>Measure,</HI> by which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Pope sells,</HI> is by a fifth part less than that by which he <HI>buys:</HI> The other is more considerable; for in the Account that he gives of the present <HI>Pope</HI>'s break∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>g in upon the settlement of the <HI>Bank,</HI> tho it is upon the matter very near the same with that which I give, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t there is a difference of some Importance as to the manner of doing it; but as to that, all I can say, is, that the first Account I had of that <HI>Transaction,</HI> was the same that is in this <HI>Gentleman's</HI> Paper; but afterwards I had occasion to talk of this matter very Copiously with <HI>one,</HI> thas has lived many years in the <HI>Popes</HI> Dominions, and that he has dealt much is those Affairs; be has now a <HI>Character</HI> upon him, and so it is not expedient to name him: It was from him that I had the particular recital of this matter, and therefore I thought it surer to go upon the Information that I had from him, than upon the general Report that all Strangers may find at <HI>Rome.</HI> This <HI>Paper</HI> had been more copious, if the Person that writ it, had not been restrained by some particular Considerations fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m saving any thing relating to the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REMARKS Upon <HI>SWITZERLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is very surprising when one comes out of <HI>France,</HI> (which is an Extraordinary good Country) into <HI>Switzerland,</HI> which is not near so fertil, and yet to see so great a difference between the <HI>People</HI> of those two Countries. The <HI>People</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and especially the <HI>Pea∣sants,</HI> are very poor, and most of them reduced to great Misery and Want. The <HI>People</HI> in <HI>Swit∣zerland</HI> cannot be said to be very Rich; but yet there are very few, even amongst the <HI>Peasants</HI> themselves that are miserably poor; the most part of them have enough to live upon, from their Labour, and the Fruits of the Earth. Eve∣ry where in <HI>France,</HI> even in the best <HI>Cities,</HI> there are Swarms of <HI>Beggers;</HI> and yet scarce any to be seen throughout all <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The Houses of the <HI>Peasants,</HI> or Country-people in <HI>France</HI> are extreamly mean, and in them no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ther Furniture to be found besides poor nasty Beds, straw Chairs, and Plates and Dishes of Wood and Earth: In <HI>Switzerland</HI> the <HI>Peasants</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ave then Houses furnished with good Fea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>er-beds, good Chairs, and other Houshold-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uff for their Convenience, as well as their Necessity; their Windows are all of Glass, al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ays kept mended and whole, and their Lin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>n very neat and white, and as well for their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing as their Tables.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>GRISONS</HI> Country.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Grisons</HI> Country is much more Barren than <HI>Switzerland,</HI> because 'tis wholy upon the <HI>Mountains,</HI> which produce nothing at all; yet notwithstanding (all Excess and Luxury being banished from amongst them, and the Inhabitants being extreamly Laborious) there are none to be seen there that are very poor and needy; but they live at Ease, and there are a great many Gentry of good Estates. Their <HI>Government</HI> is altogether <HI>Popular;</HI> there are but three or four Royalties belonging to No∣bility in all the Country. All the rest of their Lands are in Demeane, which may yet well be called Royalties too, because exempt from all dues and payments whatsoever. There is nothing at all to be pay'd for bringing into the Country any sort of Goods or Merchandises, or for exporting of them thence; every one there fully enjoys the Fruit of his own Labours, and the revenues of his Land; although the Wine they drink is brought upon Horses four or five days Journey, yet they have it cheaper there than in most parts of <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> where it so plentifully grows. There are <HI>Villages</HI> upon the very tops of the <HI>Mountains,</HI> con∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting of 250. and 200. Houses apiece; and altho' they have no Corn or grain that grows there, and but very little Grass, yet the <HI>Pea∣sants</HI> keep three or four hundred Horses which they imploy to carry goods and Merchandises,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> which turns to so good account that they live very well, and want nothing either for the Ne∣cessity of Convenience of life. The <HI>Inns</HI> upon the Mountains are very good; and there is al∣ways to be had, besides good Bread and Wine, great quantity of Game and Venison, according to the Season of the Year, good Trouts, very good Chambers, and Beds after the manner of the Country. When you leave the <HI>Grisons</HI> Country, and are come into the Country of <HI>Chavenne,</HI> the People begin to speak broken <HI>Italian:</HI> altho' this latter is a more fertil Coun∣try, yet the Inhabitants and <HI>Peasants</HI> do not live so well as in the <HI>Grisons</HI> Country, for that the Natives are more slothful and lazy: and here again there are abundance of poor People, as you will find in all parts of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Bailiage</HI> of <HI>LUGANE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are on the other side of the Moun∣tains four <HI>Bailiages,</HI> which where formerly part of the <HI>Dutehy of Milan; Lewis</HI> XII. when he lost that <HI>Dutchy,</HI> gave these <HI>Bailiages</HI> to some of the <HI>Switz Cantons.</HI> These <HI>Bailiages</HI> are cal∣led, <HI>Lugane, Lucarno, Mendris,</HI> and <HI>Belinston:</HI> I shall only take notice of the <HI>Bailiage</HI> of <HI>Lugane,</HI> which contains ninety nine <HI>Villages:</HI> The Ter∣ritories of this <HI>Bailiage</HI> and of the others, are not near so good as that of <HI>Milan,</HI> to which it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>oyns; yet the <HI>Villages</HI> of this <HI>Bailiage</HI> are very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>opulous; the Lands is very fruitful, because it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ll cultivated, and all the Inhabitants live con∣tented
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> and well; there are no <HI>Beggars</HI> amongst them, nor hardly any Object of Misery and Want: their Houses are all good, well built, and kept in good repair. The Territory of <HI>Milan</HI> is certainly one of the best in all <HI>Italy;</HI> it produceth Wine, Corn and Oyl in abun∣dance, very great quantity of Silk, and (ge∣nerally speaking) all sorts of Fruits; there is also excellent Pasture for Cat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, and yet the <HI>Peasants</HI> there do not live so well by much as in the <HI>Bailiage</HI> of <HI>Lugane;</HI> for there is a great deal of Land that lies unmanur'd, and the Country is not near so populous as in <HI>Lugane.</HI> There can be no other Reason given for this Difference but that <HI>Milan</HI> is under the Domi∣nion of <HI>Spain:</HI> That the <HI>People</HI> are loaden with Imposts, Subsidies and Taxes, which makes them very poor; whereas the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Lugane</HI> are under the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> who put no Taxes or Subsidies upon them.</P>

<HEAD>Remarks upon the <HI>LAKES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Do not know that in the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> as it was thirty years since, there were any <HI>Lakes,</HI> except perhaps in the Mountains of <HI>Dau∣phine.</HI> From the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Jour</HI> to the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Garde,</HI> which is at <HI>Desenesan,</HI> between <HI>Bresse</HI> and <HI>Veronne.</HI> In the Territories of <HI>Venice,</HI> there are a great number of <HI>Lakes;</HI> one of the most considerable is that of <HI>Geneva;</HI> then there is the Lake of <HI>Newchattel,</HI> the Lake <HI>d'Yverdun,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Morat,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Bienne,</HI> the
<PB N="9" REF="5"/> Lake of <HI>Quinti,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Lucerne,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Constance,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Valestat,</HI> and many others in the Mountains of <HI>Switzerland.</HI> There is on the other side the Mountains a great and considerable Lake, called <HI>Come,</HI> also the Lake of <HI>Lugane,</HI> the Lake <HI>Maj r,</HI> which is above 60 miles long, and likewise the Lake <HI>de Garde.</HI> All these <HI>Lakes</HI> are replenish'd with most ex∣cellent Fish, and particularly <HI>Trouts;</HI> but in the Lake <HI>de Garde</HI> there is found an admirable Fish, called <HI>Carpion,</HI> which is far more deli∣cate than either <HI>Trout</HI> or <HI>Salmon,</HI> but they are not so great; for those of the largest size do not weigh above fifteen pounds. I do not think that in any part of <HI>Europe</HI> there are so many fine <HI>Lakes</HI> to be found in so narrow a Compass, as these which I have here mentioned.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>Concerning the Dutchy of <HI>FERRARA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Duke of Ferrara</HI> hath always been but a little <HI>Prince,</HI> because his <HI>Dominions</HI> are not very great; yet there have been several of the said <HI>Dukes</HI> for above 150. years ago, and since, that have made a handsome Figure, and held a considerable Rank amongst the <HI>Princes of Italy.</HI> The Country was formerly very popu∣lous, and the Lands being fertil, and well cul∣tivated: the Revenue of the <HI>Prince</HI> were con∣siderable, and he kept a good Court. But since that <HI>Dutchy</HI> is devolved upon the <HI>See</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the Death of the last <HI>Duke,</HI> who dyed with∣out Issue Male, the Country is almost depo∣pulated:
<PB N="10" REF="6"/> the most part of the Lands are deso∣late; and for several Years last past the <HI>Dutchy</HI> is infected with Diseases, purely for want of Inhabitants. There were formly in the time of the Dukes of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> more than one hundred thousand <HI>People,</HI> and at present there are not 15000. The Grass grows in the Streets, and most of the Houses are void.</P>
<P><HI>Polesino</HI> is one of the best parts of <HI>Italy;</HI> and that part of it which is possessed by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> is very well cultivated and populous; and 'tis one of the best of their small Princes. As soon as you pass the great Arm of the River <HI>Po,</HI> which is called the <HI>Lagoscouro,</HI> which se∣parates that part of the <HI>Polisino</HI> which be∣longs to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> from that which belongs to the <HI>Pope,</HI> although the Land and Country is the very fame, yet the most part of those Lands of the <HI>Polesino,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Ecclesiastical State,</HI> are desolate and wast: the Grass lies withered and rotten upon the ground, because there is no body takes care to mow it; and in passing through great Villages, you'll find all the Houses abandon'd, and not one Inhabi∣tant to be found. It is not easily to be imagined how it is possible, that a Country so populous and flourishing, should in less than 80. <HI>years</HI> be so entirely ruined and dispeopled: by this it is very apparent, <HI>that no Subjects are so unhappy, as those that live under the Domination of the</HI> Clergy.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the Estates of <HI>BOLOGNIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the <HI>Popes</HI> had been able to have made themselves Masters of <HI>Bolognia,</HI> as they have done of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> they would thereby have reduced it to the same miserable con∣dition; but <HI>Bolognia</HI> hath always preserved their Priviledges and the Civil Government, by means of the <HI>Gonfalonniers,</HI> under whom they are governed; They have the Right of sending <HI>Embassadors</HI> to the <HI>Pope,</HI> who enjoy the same Prerogatives as do the Embassadors of the other free <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>States:</HI> The <HI>Pope</HI> cannot confiscate the Goods of any Subject of <HI>Bolognia</HI> for any Crime whatsoever. The great Mischiefs which too frequently happen here, more than in other parts, are <HI>Assassina∣tions</HI> and <HI>Murthers;</HI> those that commit them fly for shelter to some of the Churches, as to an inviolable <HI>Asylum,</HI> from whence the <HI>Legats</HI> themselves cannot bring them to be Punish∣ed; or perhaps they retire into the Country, into some Strong hold, or into the Territories of a Neighbouring <HI>Prince,</HI> where they are certainly secure, and there remain until the <HI>Legation</HI> of the then <HI>Cardinal</HI> be finished, and afterwards make an agreement with the Suc∣cessor, who for Money pardons them (having Power so to do) all the Crimes and Murthers
<PB N="14" REF="7"/> they have committed: In other respects the People of <HI>Bolognia</HI> are very happy, and live in great plenty, for that the Country is mighty fruitful; and they pay no Taxes to the <HI>Prince.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Remarks upon the Country of the <HI>Great Duke</HI> of <HI>TUSCANY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are in this Great <HI>Dukedome</HI> three considerable Cities, <HI>Florence, Pisa,</HI> and <HI>Sienna.</HI> All those who have read the History of <HI>Italy,</HI> do know, that <HI>Pisa</HI> was for∣merly a very powerful <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> that it flourished in Trade and Commerce, and that there were a great many wealthy Citi∣zens belonging to it; There needs no other proof of this, than what we read, that upon a certain occasion, a hundred of the Citizens equip'd each of them a <HI>Gally</HI> at their own Charges, which they maintained during all the War. The great Actions are well known which they have done in the <HI>Levant</HI> by their Fleets, and how they along time opposed the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> who at length subdued them by the Assistance of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Pisa</HI> is one of the largest and most beauti∣ful Cities of <HI>Italy;</HI> the Buildings are stately and fine; and so is one of their Churches,
<PB N="15" REF="7"/> which with its dependancies, is one of the finest in all <HI>Italy.</HI> The City is built upon the River of <HI>Arne,</HI> which divides it in the midst; it is Navigable for Vessels of a great burthen: and at <HI>Legorne,</HI> which is Twelve Miles di∣stance, it falls into the Sea. It is one of the best scituated Towns in all <HI>Italy</HI> for Trade, with which it flourished extreamly whilst it was a <HI>Republick:</HI> at present not only the City, but the Country belonging to it, is wholly de∣populated. Writers say, that there were formerly above one hundred and fifty Thou∣sand Inhabitants, whereas now there are not twelve Thousand. The Grass grows in most of the Places and Streets of the City, and most of the Houses are deserted, and lye void. I was my self in a fair large Pallace, which was let for six Pistoles <HI>per annum;</HI> the greatest part of their Lands lye wast, and the Air is very unhealthy in most parts, because of the small number of Inhabitants. The <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Florence</HI> thought there was no way to secure himself of this Great City, but by depopulating of it, and ruining the Trade, which rendred it so Potent, so that at present there is not any Trade there at all.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Sienna</HI> was also formerly a very fine <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> and had in it many noble, rich, and powerful Families; but since that the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Florence</HI> hath reduced it to his
<PB N="16" REF="8"/> Obedience, he hath ruined most of the No∣bility and Gentry, many of them retiring into <HI>France,</HI> and into the Territories of some of the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>As to the City of <HI>Florence</HI> it self, it is ex∣treamly decayed to what it was since it came under the Government of the House of <HI>Me∣dicis.</HI> It is plain from the History of <HI>Machia∣vil,</HI> and other <HI>Italian</HI> Authors that lived in those times, that it was three times more populous when it was a <HI>Republick,</HI> than it is now. The Great <HI>Duke</HI> keeping his Court and Residence there, one would think should make the City flourish the more; yet it wants a great deal of that Luster and Splendor it had when it was a <HI>Common-wealth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Remarks upon the <HI>Temporal Government</HI> of the <HI>POPE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are certainly very few <HI>People,</HI> so mi∣serable, as those who live under the Dominion of the <HI>Pope:</HI> most of the <HI>States of Italy,</HI> and where there are the most Subsidies and Impositions, have not put any Tax upon <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Grain</HI> which make <HI>Bread,</HI> because there is no Person, tho never so miserable, that can subsist without it; there is that hu∣manity and regard had to the <HI>People,</HI> in not
<PB N="17" REF="8"/> laying <HI>Taxes</HI> upon <HI>Bread,</HI> because 'tis the com∣mon Nourishment, and absolutely necessary even for the most Indigent and Poor; tho Im∣positions are laid without scruple upon <HI>Wine</HI> and other Merchandises, because they are not so necessary as <HI>Bread:</HI> yet the <HI>Pope</HI> makes no scruple to lay very great Impositions upon <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Bread,</HI> throughout all his <HI>Dominions,</HI> except in those places that have yet preser∣ved their Liberties. It was <HI>Donna Olimpia,</HI> that during the Pontificat of <HI>Innocent</HI> the X. began to put Taxes and Imposts upon <HI>Corn,</HI> and made such <HI>Laws,</HI> which have ruined the most part of the great Nobility and Gentry, that live under the <HI>Ecclesiastical Government,</HI> who had their Revenues consisting in <HI>Corn.</HI> All the <HI>Popes</HI> who have Reigned since <HI>Inno∣cents</HI> time, have found such a great advan∣tage to themselves by these Laws of <HI>Donna Olympia,</HI> that they have continued them ever since; and it is at present a very considerable part of the Ecclesiastical Revenue. The sub∣stance of which said <HI>Law</HI> or Ordinance is this, <HI>That no Person whatsoever is suffered to sell</HI> Corn <HI>to any Strangers; but all those that have any, are obliged to sell it at a price certain to the</HI> Ec∣clesiastical Chamber; which is not above one moiety of the real Value; and then the <HI>Ec∣clesiastical Chamber</HI> sells it again at double the price. In <HI>Italy</HI> there is no person either
<PB N="18" REF="9"/> in City or Country, in the <HI>Popes Dominions,</HI> who is permitted to make their own <HI>Bread,</HI> but every one is obliged to buy it of the <HI>Ba∣kers,</HI> who are appointed by the <HI>Chamber;</HI> in each <HI>Village</HI> and <HI>Burrough,</HI> there is but one <HI>Baker</HI> Established by the <HI>Chamber</HI> to make and sell <HI>Bread;</HI> the <HI>Baker</HI> is obliged to take the <HI>Corn</HI> of the <HI>Chamber</HI> at a certain price, and to make the <HI>Bread</HI> of such a quality and weight, and to sell it at a price certain. In the great Cities, as at <HI>Rome,</HI> there are very many <HI>Bakers,</HI> who are all obliged to buy a certain quantity of <HI>Corn</HI> of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Chamber</HI> for a whole <HI>Year</HI> to come, which they pay for before-hand, and give ten Crowns the <HI>Salme</HI> or measure, when at the same time the <HI>Chamber</HI> bought it of the parti∣cular Persons for five Crowns, at the begin∣ning of the <HI>Year;</HI> all the <HI>Bakers</HI> are obliged to take the same quantity of <HI>Corn</HI> for the <HI>Year</HI> ensuing, altho sometimes they have a great deal of the last <HI>Years Corn</HI> upon their hands, which they must deliver to the <HI>Cham∣ber</HI> for five Crowns the <HI>Salme</HI> or Measure, and then the very same <HI>Corn</HI> is sold them a∣gain for Ten Crowns. I do not believe that there is any Country in the World, that draws more profit from their Subjects for <HI>Corn,</HI> than the <HI>Pope</HI> doth in his <HI>Dominions,</HI> which hath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>een partly the Cause of the ruine of the <HI>Ec∣clesiastical
<PB N="19" REF="9"/> Estate,</HI> since the Establishment of the said <HI>Law,</HI> which was about thirty Years since: the Country is unpeopled, and great part of the Lands lye void and uncultivated, because it is not worth while to manure them when the greatest advantage and profit, ari∣sing thereby, goes to the <HI>Pope.</HI> In travelling through the Ecclesiastical Territories in <HI>Ro∣mania,</HI> and between <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> there are vast quantities of Land unmanured. A Traveller passing through the Estate of a <HI>Ro∣man Prince,</HI> told the Prince upon his return to <HI>Naples, He would if he pleased send him Husbandmen that should Manure his Lands;</HI> thinking that it had been for want of La∣bourers that the Land lay void and wast: The Prince told him, <HI>That he did not want People to Cultivate his Lands; but because they were obliged to Sell all their Corn and Grain to the Chamber at a very low Price, it would not quit cost to Manure and Cultivate it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Touching the Reduction of the Interest of Money Due by the <HI>MONTES</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>4.</HI> to <HI>3.</HI> per Cent.</HEAD>
<P>EVery body almost knows what 'tis which in <HI>Italy,</HI> and especially at <HI>Rome,</HI> they call the <HI>Montes;</HI> It is much like the Rents upon the Town-House at <HI>Paris.</HI> The <HI>Popes</HI> having occasion of Money, borrow great Sums of particular Persons at 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> In∣terest; This they call at <HI>Rome</HI> the Establish∣ment of the <HI>Monte,</HI> that is, the Creation of certain Officers, and the assignment of seve∣ral Rents for the payment of those who have lent Money to the <HI>Pope.</HI> The present <HI>Pope,</HI> finding the <HI>Chamber</HI> engaged to the Annual Payments of I know not how many Millions of <HI>Roman Crowns</HI> Interest, to those that had Lent Money upon the <HI>Monte,</HI> re∣solved in part to reduce and lessen the great Sum of Money which the Interest amounted to, and having for this purpose raised seve∣ral Milions of <HI>Roman Crowns,</HI> he acquainted those that had Money upon the <HI>Monte,</HI> that they should come and receive their principal Money, unless they would take 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> Interest, for the 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> which they for∣merly received; whereupon there being re∣ally
<PB N="21" REF="10"/> no Trade in all the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Terri∣tories, and the Lands worth nothing, and that the Estates of the Nobility were all Sold to a penny, all Persons who had Money up∣on the <HI>Monte,</HI> not knowing how to Imploy it to advantage elsewhere, let it there re∣main, contenting themselves with three <HI>per cent.</HI> instead of four <HI>per cent.</HI> which they had before. So that by this means every one concerned lost a fourth part of their yearly Income, and the <HI>Chamber</HI> got I know not how many Milions of Crowns yearly by this Retrenchment of one <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>It is almost incredible the Immense Sums the <HI>Pope</HI> hath raised by retrenching of so ma∣ny superfluous Expences, and extinguishing several Offices, to which great Salleries were paid by the <HI>Ecclesiastical Chamber,</HI> and by divers other means. Those who are well in∣formed in these matters, do for certain affirm, that all the Subsidies which the <HI>Pope</HI> hath re∣mitted to the Emperour, and King of <HI>Poland,</HI> to carry on the War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> are not the thirtieth part of the Money which he hath Treasured up; although likewise he hath pay'd many Debts of the <HI>Chamber,</HI> which were not very chargeable upon the <HI>Montes.</HI></P>
<PB N="22" REF="11"/>
<P>I ought not here to omit relating, that the <HI>Inns,</HI> especially in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> in <HI>Romania,</HI> and between <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> are very sordid and incommodious; one may give a pretty good guess at the prodigious Wealth belong∣ing to the Clergy in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> by the great quantity of Plate, Vessels, and Statues of Silver in the Churches, and by the Riches and Magnificent Furniture of their Habitations, and Vestments of the <HI>Priests.</HI> One may upon the whole Matter make this Important Reflection, That if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> doth not think of some Expedient, to hinder the <HI>Clergy</HI> from Increasing their Estates in Lands, which they do daily, they will in a very little time become Masters of the greatest part of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> for they are already possessed of more than the half of the Lands of that Kingdom, besides the other vast profits they make continually under pretence of Service to the Church, for their <HI>Masses, Buildings, Burials, Marriages, Confessions,</HI> and by their <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and the <HI>Legacies</HI> left them by Will.</P>
<P>Tho these are Remarks made in hast, yet they may be of use to the Author.</P>
<P>I know several very pleasant Stories of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> at <HI>Naples.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Salerme</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="11"/> gave them the Moiety of a great House which he had at <HI>Naples,</HI> and thereupon an In∣scription was Engraven in Capital Letters upon the Frontespiece of the House, of the Donation thereof given to the <HI>Jesuits</HI> by the said <HI>Prince;</HI> within these few years the <HI>Je∣suits</HI> have turn'd the <HI>Hieres</HI> of the Prince of <HI>Salerme</HI> out of possession of the other Moiety of the said House, and have defaced the In∣scription upon the House; and all this they have done by Colour of Law and Justice. Upon the first Establishment of the Society of <HI>Jesuits,</HI> the <HI>Carthusians</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> who are very Rich, voluntarily assigned them a yearly <HI>Pension</HI> of several thousand <HI>Ducats;</HI> but the <HI>Carthusians</HI> perceiving that of late years, se∣veral of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> were grown mighty Rich, resolved to withdraw the said <HI>Pension;</HI> the <HI>Jesuits</HI> hereupon went to Law with them, and obtained Sentence, that the said <HI>Pension</HI> should be continued. The <HI>Jesuits</HI> have got a very considerable part of the Lands of the Nobility of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> All the <HI>Religious,</HI> of what Order soever they be, who have Houses at <HI>Naples,</HI> have the Priviledge of purchasing all Houses that are contiguous to them on the one side or the other, to the very end of the Street, in order to make their Houses entire, and to stand alone like an <HI>Island;</HI> and for this purpose they have no
<PB N="24" REF="12"/> more to do, than only pay the Proprietor for his House, not according to the present Value, but as it was last sold, perhaps 50, 60, or 100 years ago; and so hath descended from Father to Son successively to the person then in Possession.</P>
<P>Many other very considerable Remarks might be made of the divers Tricks and Me∣thods the Clergy of this Kingdom make use of to Wheedle and Trapan the <HI>Laity</HI> out of their <HI>Estates.</HI></P>
