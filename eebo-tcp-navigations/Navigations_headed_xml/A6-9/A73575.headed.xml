And dutie, because I acknowledge my self boundē, both to your Worship, and to all those of my pro∣fession, to employ my whole labours to do you any plea∣sure or profit that I might.

And like∣wise that it might be some stay to young and weake wits: yeelding them therby the more freedome of mind toward their other businesse.

Desiring your Worships all, that howsoeuer you do determine of the vnabilitie of this my labour: yet that you vouchsafe to take in good part the abilitie of my loue and good meaning in it.

<HEAD>A GENERALL REMEMBRANCE FOR A SERVANT WHEN HE FIRST trauelleth to the Sea, as to Spaine or Por∣tingale, or other countreyes.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Emanuel</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> GENERAL remem∣brance for you my ser∣uant I. A. that when it pleaseth God you shall trauell vnto the sea, first &amp; principally you doe not forget v∣pon your fafe arriuall at your Port, to giue vnto God most hartie and humble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">For to feare God, and to be thankefull vnto him, is the be∣ginning of all happinesse and prosperitie in our affaires.</NOTE> thankes for his gracious protection of you, by saying as in token of your thankefulnesse, some godly prayer of thankesgiuing, or say onely with re∣uerence the Lords prayer, giuing him withall thankes in some wordes of your owne spirit.</P>
<P>Secondly, that presently vpon your arriuall, you doe make diligent inquirie, whether anie
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> ships be bound either to this Port of Bristowe, or to any part of England. And then haue espe∣ciall care, that the neerest that commeth to this Port, you write letters by them vnto me, and to them that you haue to deale for, of the arriuall of your ship: according to this plaine and briefe forme of inditing, as I will hereafter shew you. And so write likewise by your first letters, of the state of your businesse, and of the newes of the country, according as that time passeth. And when you haue learned of anie ship that commeth for England, doe not your selfe make it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This I say: to procure the more care and diligence in a youth.</NOTE> knowen to anie bodie at all: but write and deliuer your letters secretlie, for it shall sound much to your especiall credit and good liking, when your diligence shall be so seene, that your letters shall shew the first arri∣uall of your Ship: because it is the thing that euerie Marchant doth especially long after to vnderstand.</P>
<P>Thirdly, deale closely &amp; secretly in all your affaires and busynes, and before you enterprise any thing, doe you after curteous and gentle manner aske counsel, either of some Marchant in the Ship, or your Hoste, or of some English man: how you are to deale about your wares, both touching the landing it, the customing it, the selling it, the receauing of your moneyes, the buying of any wares againe, the customing the same againe, and to haue out all your writs
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> and dispatches for euery such thing, as is need∣full to be had. And hauing bin thus once in∣structed, do you with carefullnes remember it of your selfe against another time. Also be ear∣nest in noting &amp; marking euery thing that you may, but be your selfe as secret and silent as is possible.</P>
<P>Fourthly in any case shew your selfe lowly, curteous, and seruiceable vnto euery person: for though you &amp; many of vs else may think, that too much lowlinesse bringeth contempt and disgrace vnto vs: yet assuredly (it is wel known by experience) that there springeth of no one vertue so great fruit vnto vs, as of gentlenesse and humilitie: for it will both appease the an∣ger and ill will of our enemies, &amp; encrease the good will of our friends. Also in any wise be not seduced by any person, to play at any kinde of game, especially dice or cards, nor to vse fea∣sting or banketing, or keeping company with women, nor to go fine and costly in apparell: for all these things are especially noted, and doe bring any yong beginner to vtter discredit and vndoing.</P>
<P>Fiftly carie this for an especiall note, that whensoeuer you haue dealings for anie mar∣chants, you do in all things and euerie point obserue according to their commission and di∣rection. For although I knowe, it will some∣times seeme to your selfe, that you shall better
<PB N="4" REF="7"/> please your marchant, not to buy those wares which he appointeth, because of the dearenesse of them: yet (I say) you shall giue euermore best contentment to your marchant, and saue your selfe harmelesse, when you followe his owne order and remembrance. And take this also for a caueat, that you neuer think the same ware which is best cheape, and is most bought vp, that it will be best to bestow your money theron: for ordinarily it falleth out, that the quantitie of the best cheape wares that is brought home, hath smaller vtterance and lesse profite, then such deare wares as there com∣meth but very litle quantitie of. Also be care∣full in setting vp safely your money when you haue receaued it: and likewise be warie whē you receiue your moneys for your wares, crauing the paines of some marchant your freind, as to helpe you the first time to receaue it for you, vntill you haue more knowledge to receaue it your selfe.</P>
<P>Moreouer be you in any wise circumspect touching your behauiour when you be in the countrey of Spaine or else where: and shewe your selfe lowly and courteous to all people, and learne what be their ciuill lawes and cu∣stomes, and be carefull to keepe them. If anie of the rude and common sort of people (as so it is in all countreys) will by chaunce offer you anie abuse or wrong, appease them againe ra∣ther
<PB N="5" REF="7"/> by sufferance and gentlenesse, then by reuenge: for so shall you best quiet your selfe, &amp; ouercome your enemie. In the sales of your wares, doe you, before you set price of it to any man, make inquirie howe other English men haue sold the like commodities, and so do you accordingly set prise of yours. And lightly doe not refuse the second or third chapmans offer: for most ordinarily it falleth out, that the first and fourth offer is neuer so good as the third offer: but in this you are to haue a good insight your selfe, and to do according as is your hast and necessitie for your sales.</P>
<P>Be most faithful &amp; iust in all your accompts with euery man, &amp; defraud no man willingly not the value of a farthing. See that at no time you do take any mans doings or dealings into your hands, without my leaue and counsell: be∣cause by the trouble of other mens businesse, you may neglect &amp; frustrate mine owne. And haue also regarde, for those small aduentures which I shall licence you to make for your owne priuate benefit, that euery voiage you doe deliuer mean accompt of it, wherby from time to time I may see and know your estate, and what of right doeth aperteine vnto you. Be circumspect and nigh in all your expences; making your reckoning, that what you now spare and saue vnto me, it may grow the more to your owne benefit in time to come.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<P>Lastely let this be yet your first and chiefest point in all your actions: that especially you o∣mit not your dutifull seruice towards almighty God, but euerie morning and night, to pray that God will still prosper and protect you, &amp; to giue him humble thankes that he hitherto hath alwayes mercifully defended you. And this doe you performe, by saying silentlie, re∣uerently, &amp; atentiuely, such praiers as you haue learned by hart: or it your memorie cannot well remēber any other praier, say only to the praise of the blessed Trinity, the * Lords praier and the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This order of prayer I haue thought, might be good and godly: both be∣cause of the country beyond the seas, and because of mar¦chants lets and hinderance to continue in long prayer.</NOTE> Creed, vsing euermore withall these three pointes of meditation. First, to meditate your sinnes, and aske God hartely mercy, and stedfastly purpose amendment. Secondly, me∣ditate Gods benefits: and humbly thanke him. Thirdly, meditate your necessities: and craue his holy helpe for them. The which you may then conlude the effect of these meditations, by saying lastly againe the Lords praier. And this dutifull exercise of praier, I do require you neuer once to pretermit both at morning &amp; at night, how hastie and vrgent soeuer be your businesse For how great equitie &amp; reason is it, that we should spend at the least one halfe houre or litle moment of the day in thanks, ser∣uice, and mindfullnes of God: who is both carefull &amp; mindfull to serue &amp; succour vs, euen all the whole day and euer all our life long. Al∣so
<PB N="7" REF="8"/> neuer sit downe, or rise vp from meat, but be mindfull of God: &amp; in expressing your thanks∣giuing, say some Godly grace or other: or on∣ly say (rather then faile) no more then, <HI>In the name of the father, of the sonne, &amp; of the Holy Ghost,</HI> &amp; let those wordes shew your thankful∣nes to God. Finally in all your actions, vse di∣ligence, conscience, silence and patience. Thus making no doubte, but if you be mindfull of your dutie and seruice to God, all thinges shall go well and haue happy successe that you take in hand. But the contrarie doing: your labours will not prosper, nor anie thing that you doe, will euer come to good passe or per∣fection. The holy Ghost be euermore your Protector.</P>

But if they drinke weake, rough, foule, flat, inclining to egernesse, or long: they are not good.</P>

<P>Apply thy selfe vnto labour while thou art young, lest in thine old age thy body become full of diseases, and thy ende be in reproch and pouertie.</P>
<P>The godly and diligent man shall haue pro∣speritie in all his wayes: but he that followeth pleasure and voluptuousnesse, shall haue much sorow before he die.</P>
<P>Take heede of vsing a false ballance or mea∣sure, for it is an abhomination before God: and a swearing and lying tongue, maketh hote the curse of God vpon his house.</P>
<P>Couet not ouermuch familiaritie amongst men: for it maketh thee spend much losse of time.</P>
<P>Let not thy expences be equall with thy
<PB N="62" REF="36"/> gaynes: for either Sicknes, naughtie dettors, let of trade, and misfortune by the sea or land, may soone ouetthrow thee.</P>
<P>Linke not in amity with too many mē that are aboue thy calling: for it will much increase thy trouble and charge.</P>
<P>Beware in any case of suertiship: for it ma∣keth thy friend thine enemy; it indangereth thy estate; and impaireth thy owne credit.</P>
<P>Be not hasty in giuing credit to euery man; but take heed to a man that is ful of words, that hath red eyes, that goeth much to law, and that is suspected to liue vnchaste.</P>
<P>When thou promisest any thing: be not slacke to performe it, for he that giueth quick∣ly, giueth double.</P>
<P>If either of goodwill or necessity thou must doe a thing, see thou do it gladly &amp; cheerfully: for so shall thy gift be well accepted, &amp; thy la∣bour and cost neuer a whit the more.</P>
<P>Remember often thy Creator, and how he hath made the whol compasse of the day and night to serue thee, but thee to serue only him. Wherefore if thou requite not thy maker, to serue him one houre or litle momēt of the day, for foure and twenty houres which he serueth thee: for thy beastly vnthankfulnes thou hast lost both thy light in this world, and shalt find darknes in the world to come.</P>

<P>Thinke it not inough to refraine thee from doing euill: but know that it is also thy dutie to do that which is good. Therefore be feruēt for the praise of thy Creator: geue good ex∣ample: put forwards thy Children &amp; seruants in the seruice of God: help the widow, the fa∣therlesse, the stranger, the poore, and the op∣pressed.</P>
<P>Do vnto another as thou wouldest be done to thy selfe: and offer not that vnto another, which thy self wouldest take in offence.</P>
<P>Be not greedy nor in lust after that, which is both displeasant vnto God; hurtfull to thy body; an enemy to thy soule; and a shortner of thy life: which is: Wine, Wealth, and Women.</P>
<P>What winneth a man by whordome? euen but a moment any pleasure; a present sorrow to his minde; a perpetuall sicknes to his bodie; and eternall damnation (without hartie repen∣tance and amendment) to his soul.</P>
<P>What profiteth a man by deceit, forswear∣ing, and dissimulation? he heapeth to himselfe the horrible vengeance of God? and seruantes who shall serue him the like; and offereth his soul as a pray vnto Sathan.</P>

<P>What auayleth it a man to fare delicately, &amp; to drinke much of pleasant &amp; strong drinks? His mouth receaueth twise so much bitternesse as it had before delight; he shall become cor∣rupt as the Tode, and shall returne to vomite with the dogge.</P>
<P>What getteth a man by lying? Not to be beleeued when he speaketh truth.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="fable">
<HEAD>THE CONCLVSION, VVHICH is an historie very profitable and delightful for a youth to reade and meditate.</HEAD>
<P>THere was a certaine Philosopher, who lying on his death bed, called his sonne, &amp; sayd these words vnto him. My sonne when I thy father am dead, remember me by recomp∣ting often vnto thy selfe this counsell which now I giue vnto thee. First learne of the little singing birds, who neuer misse in the morning and at euening, but in their kinde, they yeeld foorth their voices in praise and reioycing of their Creator and maker: and so see that thou also do neuer forget &amp; neglect the same.</P>
<P>Learne of the litle emet, that prouideth in the sommer her foode for the winter: and so see that thou also in thy youth, labor for thy main∣tenance against thine age. Learne of the cocke, that often watcheth and croweth in the night,
<PB N="66" REF="38"/> both to preserue himself and his fellowes from the wefell: and so se that thou often watch, and stretch forth thy voice in prayer by night vnto God, and in that quiet time, studie to preuēt thy dangers. Learne of the litle dog, who because he is the humblest creature of all vnto man, is therfore most loued and esteemed: &amp; so see that thou euermore shew thy selfe humble &amp; lowly vnto euery man. Learne of the silk worm, who as soone as she gathereth strength to yeeld anie vertue frō her, neuer ceasseth nor waxeth wea∣rie vntill she die: and so see that thou also contēt not thy self, to do thy duty to God and man for a time, (as most men do) but still continue in vertue till thy verie liues end.</P>
<P>Thus my sonne (quoth he) if thou wilt obey this my counsell, it shall alwayes go well with thee: but contrariwise if thou forsake it, &amp; fol∣low thine owne imaginations, it will happen vnto thee according to this example. There dwelt by a forest side a shepheard, who to pre∣serue his sheepe from a lion, which oftentimes had caried them away for a pray to his whelp, prepared many snares and engines to destroy this lion: but the old liō perceauing these traps to be layd for him, departed with his yong one to another forrest. But when the whelp grewe to be as big a lion as his father, he thus saith vn∣to him: Father me thinks I can remember that this place is not the cuntrey where I was born,
<PB N="67" REF="38"/> what then was the cause that made thee to de∣part there hence? Saith the old lion, my sonne it is not indeed our natiue cuntrey: but there is a litle dwarf a man dwelling in that place, whō for his subtle traps that he laid to take from me my life, I feared, and so fled therehence. Saith the yong lion: and I sweare by my beard that I will be reuenged of him, and will go now and teare him in peeces with my teeth. Nay (sayth the old lion) do not so, for if I my self could not possibly get reuēge against him, thou canst not in any sort do it. But the yong lion would not be ruled by his father, but goeth vnto this forest where the shepheard dwelt: who finding him within his house &amp; the dores shut, called vnto him and sayd, ô thou naughtie &amp; vile wretch, why hast thou so abused my father, as to driue him from his natiue cuntrey, ouer which &amp; all the beasts therof, he raigned as king: I tell thee that I his sonne wilbe reuenged of thee for ma∣king him so to loose his right. The man being within his house stoutly answered: I regard not a rush either thee or thy father, but if thou once offer to enter within my doores, I haue here both my staffe and my axe to beate and to cut thee in peeces. The yong lion was straight wayes amazed at his stout wordes, and sayde: then come thou forth, and go with me to yon∣der moyle, and let him be iudge betwixt thee &amp; me, whether thou hast done my father wrōg or not, Saith the shepheard: if thou wilt adiure
<PB N="68" REF="39"/> and sweare to do me no harme, I will go with thee. So the yong lion sware vnto him to doe him no harme. The man then leadeth the way vnto the lion, by those engins that he had pre∣pared long before: and anon the yong lion fell into one of his pits, and was entangled by his 2 forefeet. O (saith the lion) helpe me, for I know not what is this that hath bound my feete verie fast together. Saith the shepheard, I am not able to helpe thee, but tary thou here, and I will go and call hither the moile. But the lion as well as he could, did yet get forth of the pit, &amp; went iumping and leaping to follow after the man. By and by againe he fel into another pit, wher∣by his two hinder leggs were also caught fast. The shepheard now seeing him well tyed and bound: he then cutteth with his knife a good greene staffe, &amp; beginneth to lay blows strōgly vpon the lion. The lion then remembred his father, and said to the man: ô beat me not on my back nor my belly, but rather beat me on mine eares &amp; on my heart: because with mine eares I would not heare the counsel of my father, nor with my heart would not beleeue it, when he said thou hadst more subtlety to preuaile, then I had strength. So the man beat him so long, both on the eares and the heart, that in the end he killed him. Euen so (saith the Philosopher to his sonne) will destructiō come vpon those which shall not accept &amp; obey the good coun∣sell and instructions of their aged fathers.</P>
