<HEAD>There was a Paper publish'd on <HI>Friday</HI> last, Entituled <HI>Considera∣tions humbly tender'd concerning the</HI> East-India-Company: And the Design of it is to offer some Arguments for continuing the said <HI>Company</HI> under the present <HI>Charter</HI> and <HI>Management.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE two first Paragraphs make a sound of a great Regard to the <HI>Public:</HI> But 'tis indeed the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>private Interest:</HI> And whatever Pretences are now made to serve a Turn at this Juncture: 'Tis notorious, That the present <HI>East-India-Stock</HI> has all along been manag'd by a <HI>few prevailing Men,</HI> who have subjected the General Concern to their particular Advantages: And more especially for about ten Years past, the whole matter has been made subservient to the boundless Ambition and Avarice of <HI>One Aspiring Person,</HI> as 'tis now so assiduously en∣deavour'd to be continu'd, by <HI>Himself,</HI> and a <HI>few Others, who have of late by his Favour been introduc'd into the Committee.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis insinuated, <HI>That the dissolving this Charter wou'd be of fatal Consequence to the Na∣tion, in giving our Neighbours opportunity to make themselves Masters of all that Trade:</HI> But the direct contrary is the real Truth, for by the late most Imprudent and Unjustifiable Pro∣ceedings, we have already in a manner lost all our Trade and Interest in those Parts, which is no other way possibly retrievable, but by a New Joynt-Stock firmly and legally esta∣blish'd: And this too, must be speedily done, or 'twill be too late.</P>
<P>'T had been happy for the Nation in general, as well as the particular Adventurers in this present Stock, if the Managers had timely and faithfully acted with that great Care to prevent the Encroachments of our Neighbours, which they now so zealously pretend, whereby we might not only have still been Masters of our <HI>Spice-Island</HI> of <HI>Poleroon,</HI> and continu'd our Settlement at <HI>Maccasser,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide,</HI> The Letters from <HI>Bantam, Anno</HI> 1679. and the Answer from <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1680.</NOTE> But have also at this time been in Possession of a most important Fortress at <HI>Bantam,</HI> which that <HI>King</HI> Courted their Acceptance of, and offer'd to Contribute to the Building it. But this great Acquisition was rejected for fear of a small Ex∣pence, When <HI>One</HI> of those many <HI>Ten-Thousand-Guinea's</HI> they bestow'd at <HI>Court</HI> to purchase a Power to oppress their Fellow-Subjects, wou'd have defray'd the Charge of their first Settlement, and 'twou'd not only before this time have repay'd them <HI>Twenty-fold,</HI> but been a lasting and growing Treasure to the Nation, and enabl'd them for the future, to stand in Competition with the <HI>Dutch</HI> as well for <HI>Empire</HI> as for <HI>Traffick.</HI> Whereas the refusal thereof, has occasion'd their being driven out of the <HI>South Seas</HI> with irrepairable <HI>Loss and Shame,</HI> and gave <HI>Our Neighbours</HI> an opportu∣nity to accomplish an entire <HI>Dominion</HI> in all those Parts: And yet these are the Men that now set up for <HI>Public Spirited Patriots,</HI> and call themselves the <HI>Conservers</HI> of the <HI>Trade of India,</HI> against the <HI>Intrusions of our Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>How these <HI>Managers</HI> have dispos'd Affairs in other parts of <HI>India,</HI> by the <HI>Violencies</HI> they have of late committed on the Lives and Goods of the Subjects of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and the <HI>King of Siam,</HI> has been already intimated in an Abstract of those their unjustifiable Actions presented to the <HI>High Court of Parliament;</HI> whereby it appears what great regard they have had as well to the <HI>Honour,</HI> as <HI>Interest,</HI> of the Nation: For from the most <HI>Belov'd</HI> and <HI>Respected,</HI> we are in a short time become the most <HI>Abhorr'd,</HI> and <HI>Infamous,</HI> of all <HI>Europeans,</HI> and so have lost a <HI>stronger Hold,</HI> than all their <HI>Force</HI> will ever be able to regain in any of those Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Thus do's the <HI>National Esteem</HI> and <HI>Interest,</HI> languish, and decline, under the <HI>Mal-admi∣nistration</HI> of the present <HI>Managers</HI> of the <HI>Companies</HI> Affairs: And is it not a fit questi∣on to be now ask'd by <HI>ONE of their Committee, What shall we do for Saltpetre for our Wars when the Trade of</HI> India <HI>is lost?</HI> To which there is only this answer to be made him, <HI>That if the Government do's not effectually and speedily interpose and settle our Trade on a good Bottom, and in a method that may be more National:</HI> We shall soon find our great want of that, and all things else we us'd to be supply'd with from those Parts, when 'tmay be too late to recover the Loss.</P>
<PB REF="2"/>
<P>But 'tis pretended, there will so many Difficulties occur in the changing <HI>This,</HI> for a <HI>New Company,</HI> that renders it impracticable.</P>
<P>As first, 'tis said, <HI>That the New Adventurers will be a great while at a Stop and Nonplus.</HI> And this is in one sense true; For 'tis certain 'twill require some time, with much prudent Care, and Study, to regain that good Respect and Credit which the late Miscarriages have justly Forfeited: But if 't be meant that there wou'd want others of as good <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> as the <HI>present Managers,</HI> to assist in the Conduct of Affairs: 'Tis a groundless Presumption.</P>
<P>But <HI>what reasonable Compensation can be made to the present Company for their dead Stock, Forts, Castles, Arms, Ammunition, and Priviledges?</HI> Why just the same as they made to the Company that preceded them: For this now in being <HI>(if any there be)</HI> is the sixth or seventh <HI>Joynt-Stock,</HI> since our Nation first engag'd in Adventures to <HI>India;</HI> And so the adju∣sting of those things is chalk'd out to us by several Presidents: And here it aptly falls in, to remind them, that are so brisk in exacting whatever they can any way lay claim to: <HI>That they also bethink themselves of discharging all their own great Debts, and restore those vast Sums they have so unlawfully taken, both from their Fellow-Subjects and Foreigners.</HI></P>
<P>There is in the Paper another little Hint or two of no <HI>material Concern;</HI> And some superci∣lious Reflections on <HI>Interlopers</HI> which may be consider'd at better leisure: While the sole intent of this, is to detect the <HI>Fallacy</HI> of some <HI>Popular Notions</HI> that are at this time with such great Industry disseminated; And to assert this important Truth; <HI>That no Man who has a right Cognizance of the Affair, can be a True Friend to his Country, and at the same time endeavour the Continuance of this</HI> East-India-Company <HI>under the present Constitution and Management.</HI></P>
