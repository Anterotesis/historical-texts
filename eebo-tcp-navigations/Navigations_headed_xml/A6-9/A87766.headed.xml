<HEAD>THE <HI>KING OF DENMARKS</HI> Navie.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the confusive distractions in this King∣dome of <HI>England,</HI> intelligence being spread abroad to most neighboring Nations, con∣cerning his Majesty most particularly, and a∣mongst others the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> hearing of the same, first convocated a Councell, and when he perceived the pronenesse, and eager readinesse of the <HI>Danes:</HI> whose propensity was greater then he expected, he forthwith by the unanimous con∣sent of his Counsell, concluded to raise a Fleet, which he would send over to the English Coast respectively. They elected immediatly <HI>Keevalo Dunous</HI> to be their chief Commander, and set for∣ward with 75 sayl the 13 of this present month of <HI>March,</HI> but they stayed two dais on shore, ex∣pecting a good wind, and so they set forward the 15. day having a good gale, tryumphing in great pomp, &amp;c. There are above 40000. <HI>Danes</HI> in all, and it is suppos'd, that their number will be short∣ly augmented. They lye now at the Coasts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and they sent a message to the King of their loyalty to his Majesty, and the cause of their comming and intents were onely to vindicate the
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>abusive injuries done against his Royall person: but the King (whose care and vigilancy extends to the prosperous security of his subiects, whose clemen∣cy is adorned with such patience, that he had rather suffer wrong himself, then bath the same in cloudy tevenge to the detriment, and hazard of his King∣domes) would not accept of their service, and dis∣creetly denyed their entertainment.</P>
<P>But they continue at the Irish Coast still, and if they hear not further answer from His Majesty speedily, they will return again into their Country, which God grant they may, as soon as they please.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The King of Frances Navie</HEAD>
<P>THe French King hearing of the turbulent divisions in <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and,</HI> and some abuses done to his Brother, known particularly by the private information of a dear Friend, and moved by the same to assist his Majesty, summoned a Navie, under the command of Captain <HI>De Sunae Bewit,</HI> and intended to set forward for <HI>England.</HI> The certainty of this News is credible, a though there hath been some ementitious Pamphlets that have heretofore bin fictitiously published, intimating that the French fleet was provided long since, bvt it was not intended before now of late: and although the o∣ther was a lye, would this were so too, but it is too
<PB REF="3"/>certaine. They have fifty six saile, and about thir∣ty thousand souldiers, loaded like wise with great provision of Armes.</P>
<P>They lye in the narrow seas, and were discryed by two <HI>English</HI> Merchants ships, who espied them there, and reported it at <HI>London</HI> for truth.</P>
<P>And noe question but they will be at <HI>England</HI> very suddatnely, if they be not timely prevented, for besides that number, twice as many more are resolved to second them, and doe now waite in rea∣dinesse: they come likewise to maintaine his Ma∣jesties cause; but I hope his Majestie will neither accept of their service, nor have any cause to vse them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The King of Spaines Navy.</HEAD>
<P>THe Spaniard (like a crafty For) harh al∣wayes weighted for his prey on <HI>England,</HI> which hath beene the sole object of his greedy intentions. Witnesse first that formidable and invincible Armado in 88. which was suffici∣ently potent to have blasted the whole Kingdome at one brunt, had not the divine protection aver∣ted it from vs.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P>Now likewise the King of <HI>Spain</HI> perceiving a sedition, and various confusion in the Kingdome, hath provided a fleet consisting of 23. ships, under the Command of Captain <HI>Don Pedringano,</HI> to the number of 8000. souldiers, waiting on the Seas for his opportunity. These ships were espyed a hundred leagues distant from the Spanish Coast, some think his intent hereby is for the defence of his own Country, but that seems improbable, in regard it is so far remote from their own shore: o∣thers think verily that his meaning is to aid, and assist his Majesty upon just occasion: but in my opinion I conceive his intent is to wait rather for his own prey, and watching his opportunity: for those that are too officious in warlike affairs, espe∣cially in a forraign Kingdome, will rather regard their own ends, then any others, for they will al∣wais turn to the strongest side: But I hope all his evill intentions, and private stratagems will fall on his own head.</P>

<HEAD>The States of Venices Navie.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Italians</HI> seriously understanding some wrongs offered unto his Majesty, acquain∣ted the States of <HI>Venice</HI> with the same. Who immediatly sate in Councell about it, and after some mature deliberation concluded to set out a Navie to assist his Majesty, which was una∣nimously confirmed, and assented unto their fleet consisteth of 48. ships, under the Commad of Cap∣taine
<PB REF="4"/><HI>Hupah Fenao,</HI> there being at the least 36000. souldiers, being also provided with strong ammu∣nition of arms: they lye now within lesse then 40. leagues from the Downs, and are suddenly inten∣ded to appropinquate the English Coast, being all unitely resolved to maintain the Kings own person from all injuries, or abuses: but I hope the Kings clemency will mittigate their anger, and no doubt, but that His Majesty will not entertain them, ha∣ving no cause of any such vindication.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>COnstancy is an Antidote against fear: wher∣fore let us be sincerely constant in our minds, and we may easily expell fear from our thoughts. First constant to God, constant to our King, con∣stant to our Parliament, constant to our selves, and lastly constant to truth and equity. These being tru∣ly performed, we need not to fear either any for∣raign or domestick enemy, As for these Navies a∣forementioned, they may perhaps cast a repercussive fear and astonishment into the minds of some: but if we be really true, and constant in our minds, we need not fear them.</P>
<P>As for those injuries, and abuses done to His Ma∣jesty, which they intend, and are resolved to vindi∣cate, for my own part, I am ignorant of any; which if there were, I believe His Majesty is more loving, and tender over his Subjects, then for some particu∣lar abuse to depopulate the whole Kingdome in re∣venge
<PB REF="5"/>of the same. And the Parliament are so judi∣cious in their pious way, and in all their mature Counsels, that if any known, and unjust injury sholy be offered unto his Majesty, they would (I am con∣fident) according to Equity and Iustice correct the same. And they are so vigilant, and carefull for the safety, and security of the Kingdome, that if any e∣nemy should violently oppose us, they would bee speedily provided for them in defedce of the Realm. God grant that the King and Parliament may so u∣nitely accord, and correspond together, that no cause of Fears, and Iealousies, that no suspition of injuries, may be reflected on either.</P>
