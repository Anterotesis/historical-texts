<HEAD>The Seamans Diall, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen, and deare fellow Seamen:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Would no wayes have you to wonder, that notwithstanding the Oathes I have taken, and the ingagements I have made, together with my credit, and the trust the Parliament put in me, I should neverthelesse leave the Parliament, and now betake my selfe unto the service of my Soveraigne gracious King <HI>Charles,</HI> in which I am resolved to live and dye.</P>
<P>For my Oathes, the Solemne League and Covenant, binde us unto the preservation of Religion, and Liberties, and to maintaine, and defend the Kings Person and Authority.</P>
<P>Concerning Religion, since wee tooke the Covenant that is almost quite lost, and that which ought to be but One, is now increased into so many, that the Religion of these times, is like unto a Common-Queane, that hath borne a Childe unto every Whoremaster in the Parish, and hath as many names and sir∣names for her Bastards, as she hath had Fornicators for their Fathers; and therefore is it that since wee left the old Prote∣stant Religion of the Church of England, which King <HI>Charles</HI> well maintained, Anabaptists, Brownists, Famelists, Erastians, Quakers, Shakers, Independents, and many more Sects which are unworthy the naming, are so ripe amongst us, because wee have left our first love, and our first faith, and are gone almost every one as the Scripture sayes, a whoring after our owne in∣ventions; so that the truth and life of Religion is even quite lost in us; and you know fellow seamen, that there was never so much cunning and cozening, and such deceipt in trade amongst us, as since these holy professors began to increase: Besides how for our wavering, and ficklenesse in Religion are we mar∣ked and pointed at beyond the Seas: And no marvell wee are become a scorne unto others, if wee consider how much worse and more corrupt wee are growne in our manners; for since this new preaching and praying came amongst us, I see no a∣mendment in our lives, onely our professors can sinne with
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>more secresie and cunning, and doe allow that unto themselves under some name in Religion, which they condemne in others, whoring, and cheating, and lying, and dissembling, being no faults in these men, when they will openly raile at the merri∣ments or drunkenesse, which I doe not excuse of other men; as though Almighty God, and they say so too, would see no sinne in these Saints, and you may observe this sort of men, much more ambitious and coveteous then other men are: You see that our old honest preaching, which gave us instruction for our conversation towards God and man, and to lead our lives in all honesty and godlinesse of living, is turned into rayling against the King, and the Bishops, and the Cavaliers, and our old go∣vernment in Church and Common-wealth, under which God did much more blesse us then now; yea not onely the Mini∣sters, but every other man preaches amongst us, and men that cannot well read will be expounding the Scriptures, though St. <HI>Paul</HI> says there are many things in them hard to be understood.</P>
<P>And since the booke of Common-prayer, which I have heard, the Martyrs of the Protestant Religion gathered together was suppressed, every man prayeth and prates as he pleaseth, and men are become more confident and familiar with God, and be much lesse humble then ever the Saints, or Christ him∣selfe were in their prayers set downe unto us in the Scripture, praying for nothing but what may please them, or for a blessing upon the plots of the Parliament; yet these who doe thus de∣stroy Religion, are wee see the men whom the Parliament prin∣cipally encourage, which sure cannot be thought the preservati∣on of Religion according unto the Covenant.</P>
<P>For our liberties, though I cannot I praise God much com∣plaine my selfe, yet I have heard ten times more stories of the oppression of the Subjects since the Parliament sate, then in the whole Reigne of King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles;</HI> yet wee know how many worthy Commanders and Seamen have been put out of their places, and cast into prison, <HI>[as Stradling, Ket∣tleby, Ashly, and others,]</HI> unto the utter undoing of their wives and children, without any examination or offence pro∣ved, but meerely for suspition that they loved the King; were
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>plainely see there is no Law, but the will of the Parliament, and whereas before it was lawfull to sue the King himselfe in any of the Courts, now a Parliament man must not be toucht: And who can say that ever he could get any justice against a Parliament man by a Petition unto the Houses?</P>
<P>In the Covenant wee have sworne to defend the Kings Person and Authority; yet wee know that he hath been long kept so straight a Prisoner, that the meanest Sub∣ject would have thought himselfe very much wronged to have been kept so long in prison without a hearing; for the Kings Authority, the very name of that is scarce left us, when it is become a great fault to pray for the King, or to drinke unto his health; although Gods word bids us pray for Kings, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.2. And if the least signe of duty, and well wishing unto him can be discovered; it is proofe e∣nough to put a man out of any place of profit or trust. You see how wel the Parliament have maintained the Kings Au∣thority, when that they have voted that no further Addres∣ses be made unto him, and when the Army have in their De∣claration told us, That they are resolved to settle the go∣vernment without a King, and against him, and against all that take part with him; which is the same thing, as to say, That they will have no King at all to raigne over them: There can be no man so silly sure, as to thinke that the Parli∣ament or Army ever thinke to have a King, when they will not proceed against <HI>Rolph,</HI> who hath three witnesses to prove against him a designe to take away the Kings life by the perswasion of the Army, because no doubt many of both Houses had their hands with him in the plot.</P>
<P>For the Covenant, though I could have been well con∣tented that I had never taken it; I believe I have kept it better in leaving the Parliament, then I should have done by staying in their service; for they have put downe both Religion, and the King, and broken the Covenant in every point, but in pulling downe the Prelates, and that it must be thought was to get the Bishops Lands for themselves; for Popery, wee see they passe not much of it.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>The Covenant was for the preservation of Religion, and li∣berties, and to maintaine the Kings Person and authority, this Oath I tooke, and so far will keepe it (God assisting) preserve to my power the Protestant Religion, which the Parliament practise to suppresse; and defend the King, whom the Parlia∣ment would depose: they were the ends for which I tooke the Oath; I breake not my Oath and trust, when I keepe the end of my Oath and trust, which were to preserve Religion, and defend the King; if they will (as they do) destroy both, it is they have broke their Oath and trust; and not I; for I would never have undertaken a trust to destroy these two things, which every Christian ought to serve and honour, his Religion and King, which since the Parliament (as all men see) have done, let them trust unto themselves, and their Sectaries; no ho∣nest man that hath a conscience unto God, can keepe such a trust, unlesse he will commit the greatest sinne against God, and his owne Conscience: and therefore deare fellow Sea-men be no longer abused by the devices of the Parliament, but re∣turne unto your duty of obedience unto God and the King, Give unto God the things that are Gods, and unto Caesar the things that are Caesars <HI>Matt.</HI> 22.21. joyne your hearts and hands with us your Brethren now in the Kings service, to re∣store the protestant Religion, and his Majestyes Religion ought to be one and the same, we ought not to halt betweene two Religions, 1. <HI>Kings</HI> 18.19. There are now instead of two Religions more then the Moone hath changes in the yeare: let us set up the old protestant Religion, used in King <HI>Edwards</HI> dayes, in blessed Queene <HI>Elizabeths</HI> dayes, in King <HI>James</HI> his happy dayes, and in the Raigne of King <HI>Charles,</HI> which was a prosperous time, untill the Parliament Ruled, and suffred him not to Raigne: Let us restore the King who hath beene more wronged then ever Prince was; Gods word commands us to honour our King, not to think ill of him, much lesse to speake ill of him, and surely least of all to lift up our hands or sight a∣gainst him, which whosoever doth shall receive unto himselfe damnation, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.8. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 10.20. <HI>Job</HI> 34.18. 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 26.9. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.31. <HI>Ecle.</HI> 8.2. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1. Our
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>King is a good King, a most gracious Prince, tender of his Subjects, loving to his Queene, carefull of his Children, cour∣teous to his people, bountifull to his Servants, zealous towards God; his whole life was never stained with a foule fault, what man is there in both the Houses like him for conversation? what leading man is there amongst them that may not be mar∣ked forth by some sinne? let us then lend our helpe unto him, and pull downe his Enemies: The strengths of the Kingdome (whereof the Navy are the chiefe) are by the Law the Kings; I have heard that what in the time of Peace is a private mans property if it be a strength (put to the case a Castle or ship of de∣fence) during time of war becomes the Kings, by the Law of the Land: the Parliament have wrested the King out of his Rights, out of the strengths of the Kingdome, both by Sea and Land: It is in your power in part to right him, and to deliver unto him not onely what is always his owne, the Royall Navy, but also what this war maks his the use of all vessels of defence.</P>
<P>The Sea-men are the wall of this Iland, do your duties, there is no man can put a trust upon you or you receive any, but that which stands with your duty to your Prince, which you owe unto him, and whilst you do you make no breach of trust unto any other; for you do but what honesty requires, give every man his owne, and this we ought to do, or otherwise you joyne with them that wrong the King, in not giving unto him what the Lawes of the Land give unto him: for suppose a man take away a purse of money upon the high-way from ano∣ther and gives me who know not be came by it by robbery, this purse to keep, afterwards I certainely finde that the money is not his, but an honest mans from whom he tooke it by violence: unto which of the two (think you) am I bound to restore the purse? whether unto him who gave it me in trust to keep, or unto the true owner? Certainely unto the true owner, when I know him to be so, and not unto the robber; for then I make my selfe a thiefe with him; for he cannot trust me with that which is properly another mans, and the Lawes of God and man, bids us give unto every man that which is his owne; and so would I wish you deare
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>fellow Sea-men to do, and what I speake unto you, I speake likewise unto the Water-men; that Com∣pany hath alwaies beene a Nursery of able Sea-men.</P>
<P>By this course ye shall not only do what every Christian ought to be carefull of, your duty to God and your King, but also exceedingly relieve your Countrey, and benefit your selves; for you know the great decay of trade, and how the Merchants (by whom the most of you live) are al∣most beggered, which hath brough such great want upon many of you, and your poore families; only the Sea-men have not been so poore since the memory of man, and sure∣ly because of our disobedience unto our Soveraigne King <HI>Charles</HI> is this great curse come upon us, we were first used to serve the Parliaments wicked turnes against the King: Returne then honest hearts unto your King, and doubt not but you will recover your los∣ses, and gaine Gods blessing upon you; we have great encouragements to gather and keepe together to doe this good worke, wee have able and good Churchmen with us, who have not turned about with the winds of new doctrines; we have many well borne Gentlemen amongst as Com∣manders, we have the Kings Son, his Highnesse the Doke of Yorke our Admirall; we stand up for our Religion, our King, and our liberties, all which the Sectaries trample upon, and would pull downe.</P>
<P>His Highnesse the Prince of Wales hath declared. 1. The reestablish∣ment of the Protestant Religion. 2. To rescue his Majesty from imprison∣ment that he may si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Parliament, and enjoy his rights. 3.

That the Army of Secta∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s may be dub nded. 6. That all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xes and Cesses may be taken off. 7.
