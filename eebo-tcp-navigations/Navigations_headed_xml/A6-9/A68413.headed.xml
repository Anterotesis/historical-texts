<HEAD>¶TO
THE MOST HIGH
and mightie Prince our King
and fouereigne, Don Iohn, the
third of that name, king
of Portingale, and of
the Algarues,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T hath séemed to me so straunge and
waightie a thing (most high &amp; migh∣tie
Prince our king and Souereigne)
to vndertake to write of the most
worthy and valyaunt acts which the
<HI>Portingales</HI> haue enterprised in the
discouery and conquest of the <HI>Indias,</HI>
that oftentimes I thought to giue
ouer and relinquish the same, but as the attempt and dooing
thereof was principally taken in hande for the glorye of
Almightye God, and to conuert those barbarous Nations
to the Christian Faith, and the great honour of your high∣nesse,
wherein God gaue them (by his Omnipotent pow∣er,
fauour and mercye (such fortunate successe in the at∣chieuing
of those famous actes, without whose great pro∣uidence
it coulde neuer haue béene performed or brought
to passe. And therefore doe hope and altogether comfort
my selfe with the ayde and assistaunce of his diuine good∣nesse
in publishing the same by writing, yéelding the
glorie thereof onely to his celestiall Godhead, and the
<PB REF="4"/>
praise terestriall vnto your excellent highnesse, and to
that famous and most happie king, <HI>Don Manuel</HI> your Fa∣ther.
And although the same be well knowne and spread a∣broad
ouer all the worlde, yet it cannot be so perfectlye
published vnlesse it bée set forth in writing. For by this
meanes the memorie thereof will indure for euer, because
that the writings will alwayes shew the same to bée pre∣sent.
Like as it doth continue those actes of the Gréeks, and
of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the which long since is past so many
yeares. And therefore they lyke wise men, perceiuing the
same to be true, did trauaile all that was possible to leaue
the memorie thereof by writing, and noting that the wor∣thinesse
of the same did consist much in the eloquence of
the writer, did therefore choose such excellent learned men
as those were that wrote the same, béeing thereto aided
with much fauour and helpe, of others that were nothing
inferior vnto theyr own, &amp; possible were far greater, but for
that the same did not remaine in writing, there is no me∣morie
thereof, euen as those of the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> of the <HI>Me∣des,</HI>
of the <HI>Persians,</HI> of the <HI>Affricans</HI> against the <HI>Romanes,</HI>
of the <HI>Sweuians</HI> against <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a∣gainst
the Moores in the recouerye of their Countrey of
<HI>Spayne.</HI> Principallye of those inuincible and holye
Kinges of <HI>Portingale</HI> your auncestours, the King <HI>Don
Alonso Henriques,</HI> the King <HI>Don Sancho</HI> his sonne, the
King <HI>Don Alonso,</HI> the which did gettte the Kingdome
of <HI>Portingale,</HI> and of the <HI>Algarues,</HI> in the which con∣quest
there was wonderfull greate actes done, and that
by force of Armes. Of all the which almost there hath
remayned no memorie of that there shoulde haue béene,
yea, those matters of the <HI>Indyas,</HI> the which was done
but yesterdaye, there is no man that hath the same in
memorye more then foure personnes, so that if they had
dyed, all the same hadde ended with them, the which
woulde haue béene imputed to theyr greate shame and
rebuke.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
And I hauing a regarde, and partlye a remorse to sée this
losse, did therefore determine my selfe to note of those no∣table
actes, the which your subiects hath done in the disco∣uerie
and Conquest of the <HI>Indias,</HI> of whose valiauntnesse
there is none of theyr progenitours of any age or antiqui∣tie
that euer did excéede them, no, nor yet were equall
with them. For leauing a side the Conquest of the <HI>Semy∣rian</HI>
of <HI>Cyro, Pirhus,</HI> and of other barbarous, all (the
which was nothing in comparison of this) and take amon∣gest
them also that great <HI>Alexander</HI> the which was so fea∣red
and wondred at throughout all the world, since that the
<HI>Indias</HI> is frequented by the <HI>Portingales:</HI> theyr dooings are
no more meruailed at, then a dead Lyon in respect of one
aliue, for the Conquest of <HI>Alexander</HI> was all by lande,
and against people that were smallie accustomed or tray∣ned
in the feates of warres, hée alwayes going in his roi∣all
person, but this of the <HI>Indias</HI> was done by sea, and that
by your Captaines, béeing vpon the same a whole yeare,
and eight monethes, and at the least sixe monethes, not a∣long
or néere any coast, but by the bottomelesse and great
Ocean Sea, and departing from the lymites of the Oc∣cident,
and bearing sayle alwayes towarde the Cape <HI>De
las Playas,</HI> or such lyke, without discouering or séeing a∣ny
other thing, but onelye the heauens and water, going
round about all the Spheare, a matter neuer before at∣tempted
by anye mortall man, nor yet almost imagined
by anye, to put the same in practise, and they hauing past
greate hunger, thirst and other infirmityes, besides that
euerye day with those furious stormes and raines, in daun∣ger
a thousand times of their liues. And as I say, they ha∣uing
past those feares and daungerous troubles by sea, yet
after theyr arriual into the <HI>Indias,</HI> found thēselues in great
and cruell battells, (not with men that did sight onely with
their Bowes, Arrowes, and Speares,) as they didde in
<HI>Alexanders</HI> time, but with such as were stout &amp; of a hauty
stomacke, and with men that were experienced in the wars,
<PB REF="5"/>
of the which kinde of people there is not onely in the <HI>In∣dias,</HI>
but as farre as we can vnderstand, there is of the like
in <HI>Asia,</HI> and besides theyr accustomed weapons (the which
are many and good) yet they haue Ordinaunce, Calée∣uers,
and many fire-workes more plentie then the <HI>Por∣tingales</HI>
had, so that the power of these men was alwaies
so greate, that the force of king <HI>Poro</HI> with whome <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>
did fight, was not comparable, yet notwithstanding
the <HI>Portingales</HI> did giue them continually the ouerthrow,
although theyr strength was but small, yet they neuer left
the warres, as <HI>Alexander</HI> did. And leauing off to de∣clare
of the Gréekes and of theyr actes, and now to come
to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> who with theyr huge armye, and with
theyr greate Fléete, the which séemed to couer the whole
Sea, thought to conquest the whole worlde, yet they ne∣uer
durst aduenture by Sea further then the redde Sea,
neyther yet the greatest of their famous victoryes, did or
was euer lyke vnto the least of those battayles that was
done by our men in the <HI>Indyas,</HI> in the which it is so well
knowne, most inuincible Prince, the greate prosperitye of
the King your Father and you, so that without moo∣uing
of your selfe out of your pallaice, was discouered and
conquered by your Captaines, the which neuer Princes
could by themselues conquere or discouer, so that there
was neuer Conquest of the Barbarous, nor of the <HI>Greci∣ans,</HI>
nor of the <HI>Latynists,</HI> the which was of lyke difficul∣tie
as this hath béene, neyther yet Kinges nor Captaines,
of none of all these Nations, was so equall in force nor
yet in valyauntnesse as those of your Father, and of yours,
the which is manifestly declared by the discourse of the hi∣storie
following.</P>
<P>And touching theyr greate actes which they dydde
worthelye fulfill and bring to passe, wée must verelye be∣léeue
that it was Gods good will and pleasure, that
those Barbarous, béeing discouered with theyr vaine
Idolls, and with the false sect of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> shoulde ioyne
<PB REF="5"/>
themselues with the Catholike faith, and to be as it wer in
one Corall, and vnder one Pastour or Shepheard, as at
this present the great multitude that héereby are in∣creased
to the Christian Religion, is a manifest testimo∣nie
and witnesse thereof. After which great exploytes,
your Highnes gaue commandement that the Christian doc∣trine
of the Brotherhood of the company of Iesus should be
there instructed &amp; taught them, of the which your Highnesse
hath had so speciall a care like a most godlye and Christian
Prince, that not onely you were the first that commaunded
the same to be brought from <HI>Rome,</HI> for that they might bée
the better instructed in all their Kingdomes, but also doeth
maintaine vpon your owne charges in this holy companye
the multitudes that doeth daylye submit themselues to the
same. As we doe sée in the sumptuous Colledge of <HI>Coim∣bro,</HI>
where to ennoble and augment the honor of your king∣domes,
you haue erected and founded an Vniuersitie: where,
with the charges that is daylye done there, and with your
countenaunce together, it is hoped, that the same may be ac∣counted
amongst the florishing Vniuersities of all <HI>Europe:</HI>
whereas there is maintained also vpon your charges manye
Colledges of the order of poore begging Friers, and others
of like profession, for like as the reformation that was there
made was profitable to them all: so he commaunded, that
there should be many Diuines for to declare the Euangely∣call
law, which your Highnes is not onely at this charges
with religious men, but also with temporall men, for as
there is many of your subiects that doth defend y<SUP>e</SUP> state Re∣publike
or Common welth, and doth inlarge the same with
their armour, so ther are others that doth beautifie the same
with learning. These heroycall vertues of your Highnesse
being so well knowen vnto me, forsomuch as this Booke,
besides others that I haue made, hath some tast or kindred
of learning, doth incourage me the more to set them foorth,
for that as I say, there may remaine a perpetuall memorye
of so notable actes as so many Gentlemen and Knights of
<PB REF="6"/>
the <HI>Portingales</HI> your subiects hath done, the which hath be∣nefited
me very much, my being in the <HI>Indias,</HI> where I tra∣uayled
with my Father, who by your Highnes commaun∣dement
was sent thether to serue as a Iudge. And for that
I spent all my youth in learning, and gaue my selfe greatly
in reading of auncient Histories, and hauing séene and read
a great part thereof, did then immediately procure to know
and with all diligence did my best indeauour to vnderstand
what had bene done in the Discouerie of the <HI>Indias,</HI> and in
the Conquest of the same, by the <HI>Portingales,</HI> with the in∣tent
as aforesayde, which was to make the same knowen,
and common to all men: by meanes whereof, and through
the instructions of sundry Gentlemen and Captaines, ma∣ny
things came to my knowledge, by such persons as were
then and there present, as well in the counsayle for the pro∣uision
for that which should be done, as also in the executi∣on
thereof, and otherwise by many letters and pamphlets,
the which were written by men of great credite, and lyke∣wise
examined as sufficient witnesses for better credite of
the worke. Moreouer, I did not onely vse this dilygence in
the <HI>Indias,</HI> but after my comming to <HI>Portingale</HI> didde the
lyke. For as those matters the which I meant to write
of, were many and of sundrye orders, so it was necessarye
to enforme my selfe of the same by manye: and beside that
those that gaue me this instructions wer sworn, yet I was
licensed to present them as witnesses. There were of them
that I sought in the most part of <HI>Portingale:</HI> for what with
the great trauell of my person, and expences of my goodes,
for that they were seperated in sundry parts, and in this I
haue spent the most part of my lyfe, forsomuch as this was
my onely recreation, hauing ioyned together all these infor∣mations,
since my being in the Vniuersitie of <HI>Coimbro,</HI> in
your Highnes seruice, at such time as I found my selfe not
occupied with the executing of my office, with great trouble
(not onely of the body, but also of the spirite) made an end
of this Booke with others, the which I doe humbly offer

vpon Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> daye the same yeare, from whence
they were set forward on their way, by <HI>Cosmo de Medicis</HI>

which Religion, wer then none other but <HI>Portingales.</HI> And
from the <HI>Rhoodes</HI> they went to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> from thence
to the <HI>Cayro,</HI> as Merchaunts, and from thence in the com∣panie
of certaine <HI>Moores</HI> of <HI>Feez,</HI> and <HI>Tremencen,</HI> they
came to <HI>Toro,</HI> which is a place that hath his harbour in

to another place in the selfe same Sraightes of the

whence they went to <HI>Edin:</HI> And for that it was out of
the waye to the <HI>Indies,</HI> they parted companye and seuered
themselues: <HI>Alonso de Payua</HI> remained to go ouer by land
to the Emperour of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Presbiter Ioan by errour, is the verye Emperour of Aethi∣opia.</NOTE> which is he, whom we be∣fore

was vanquished and dyed. And so thencefoorth finally en∣ded
his Kingdome, so that in these dayes, there is in trueth
none of that name or race that raigneth or gouerneth. It
is to be vnderstoode, that <HI>Alonso de payua</HI> did verely be∣léeue,
that this Emperour of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> was this suppo∣sed
<HI>Presbiter Ioan,</HI> by reason he was informed and
had intelligence that the same Emperour was a Chri∣stian,
and the People of his Kingdome were also
Christians, as héereafter I shall declare, when occasion shall
serue.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
For which cause, I am in opinion, y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Alonso</HI> did depart to∣wards
his Court, taking order and determining with <HI>Pe∣dro
de Couillian,</HI> that at a time appointed they shuld méet
in the great <HI>Cayro:</HI> This conference and determination
betwéene them so had and accorded vpon, <HI>Pedro de Couil∣lian</HI>
went towards the <HI>Indies</HI> in a shippe of the <HI>Moores</HI> of
<HI>Cananor,</HI> and béeing come to the <HI>Indies,</HI> he went to the
towne of <HI>Calicut,</HI> and to the Ilands of <HI>Goa,</HI> where hée ga∣thered
perfect information &amp; intelligence of the spices which
they haue in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and of the commodities which
come from other places, and of the lyke sorte of Townes
which were ther in the <HI>Indies,</HI> of all which he set downe the
names in the Card he carried with him, albeit ill written.
And after he had séene those places, he went to <HI>Sofala,</HI> where
he gathered knowledge of the great Iland of <HI>San Lauren∣so,</HI>
which the <HI>Moores</HI> doe call <HI>La ysla de la Luna:</HI> And sée∣ing
the people of <HI>Sofala,</HI> to be blacke as those of <HI>Guynee</HI>
are, he therevpon surmised that all that coast was subdued,
and that they might goe by Sea to the <HI>Indias,</HI> and there∣fore
returning thence, he went to <HI>Ormuse,</HI> and so to <HI>Cay∣ro,</HI>
where hée vnderstoode that <HI>Alonso de Payua</HI> was
dead: And béeing desirous to returne to <HI>Portingale,</HI> by

King <HI>Don Ioan,</HI> that they had béene in the <HI>Cayro,</HI> &amp; vnder∣stoode
there much newes of <HI>Ormuse,</HI> and of theyr tract had

by <HI>Raby Abraham</HI> to <HI>Pedro Couillian,</HI> and to <HI>Alon∣so
de Payua,</HI> declaring that his pleasure was, they shoulde
retourne in the companie of those Iewes, if they had séene
all those thinges, whereof hée gaue them charge and
commaundement, at their departure: if not, that then they
shoulde sende by those Iewes a declaration, and true re∣porte
what they had séene, and had intelligence of: And
moreouer that they shoulde procure to atteine to the sight
<PB REF="10"/>
of <HI>Presbiter Ioan,</HI> and also shewe and informe what they
coulde concerning <HI>Ormuse</HI> to <HI>Raby Abraham</HI> for that hée
had sworne by his lawe neuer to retourne to <HI>Portingale,</HI>
vnlesse hée first sawe the same: Vppon receipte of which
letters and message, <HI>Pedro de Couillian</HI> his purpose of re∣tourning
to <HI>Portingale</HI> was then stayed: And therefore he
forthwith dispatched <HI>Ioseph</HI> with letters to the King, his
Lorde and Maister, wherein hée related and fully declared
in euery respect what hée had séene in the <HI>Indias,</HI> and of <HI>So∣fala:</HI>

hée is not called by the name of <HI>Prester Ioan,</HI> as I will
heereafter declare: When <HI>Ioseph</HI> was departed, <HI>Pedro de

himselfe was determined to make his voyage to <HI>Presbiter

he came to the presence of y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour, that then ther reig∣ned

hée was verye well receiued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Portin¦gales let∣ters deli∣uered to the Empe¦rour of Aethiopia</NOTE> and when hée had presented

Prince so farre distaunt from his Countrie: Howbeit
hée gaue to the same little credite, and yet neuerthelesse hée

hée coulde not by him bée lycensed to depart thence, neither

succéeded <HI>Nahu:</HI> so that <HI>Pedro de Couillian,</HI> remayned in
that Countrie, and neuer after returned into <HI>Portingale,</HI>
neyther yet the King <HI>Don Ioan</HI> euer hearde or vnderstoode
more of him, and therefore supposed him to bée dead. One∣ly
there remaineth the information of his trauailes, which
hée had sette downe and written in the letters which the
Iewes carryed: After this came to <HI>Lishborne</HI> a Frier out
of the Countrie of <HI>Presbiter Ioan,</HI> to whome the king shew∣ed
great curtesie, and vpon whose reporte, and great relati∣on
made of that countrie, the king then determined to pro∣céede

<SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE King <HI>Don Ioan</HI> béeing dead, <HI>Don

a higher stomacke, and more valy∣auntnesse
of minde (for atteining of things
impreagnable &amp; making triall, and executing
matters that passed common capacitie of
man, and aboue the retch of naturall knowledge) then was
in <HI>Alexander</HI> the greate. <HI>Don Manuel</HI> now come to the
crowne, and earnestly minded &amp; bent to prosecute that which
his predecessour <HI>Don Ioan</HI> had begun, for discouering of the
<HI>Indias,</HI> and being therein greatly furthered by such matter,
order, and intelligence, as he found, and were left by the late
king for Nauigation to those farre countries: he then com∣maunded
that <HI>Fernan Lorenso,</HI> Treasurer of the house of
the <HI>Myna,</HI> should cause to be made and prepared of the tim∣ber
which was bought in king <HI>Iohns</HI> time, two shippes,
wherevnto after they were finished, he gaue the names, to
the one, the <HI>Angel Gabriel,</HI> being of an hundred and twen∣tie
tunne: and to the other Saint <HI>Raphael,</HI> a shippe of one
hundred tunne. And to goe in the companie of these ships,
the King then bought of a Pilot that was borne in <HI>Lagus,</HI>
called <HI>Berrio,</HI> a Caruell of fiftie tunne, which had and bare
the selfe name of the Pilot: Moreouer he bought a ship of
two hundred tunne, of one <HI>Ayres Correa.</HI> These Shippes
thus made readie and prepared, and the king then being in
<HI>Monte mayor</HI> the new, with his first wife the Quéene, <HI>Dō∣na

before was seruaunt to <HI>Don Ioan,</HI> &amp; borne in the towne
of <HI>Synis,</HI> a harbour towne in the fields of <HI>Dorricke.</HI> The
same was a man experimented in matters of the Sea, and
of Nauigation, wherein he had done to this kingdome great
seruice. And forasmuch as he was a man of greate courage
and valure, and therefore very apt and likely to atteine and
atchieue the end, y<SUP>•</SUP> was by the king desired, the king then ac∣cordingly
in presēce of many noble personages, to his great
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
praise, and no lesse incouragement, commaunded him, when
he gaue him the charge of that iourney, earnestly also requi∣ring
him, to aunswere and satisfie the expectation and credit
he had conceiued of him and reposed in him, which if he did,
he would then very largely reward that his indeauour, and
trauell, and so liberally deale towardes him, as he shoulde
finde himselfe satisfied for that his dilligence and seruice im∣ployed:
and for some proofe of those princely and louing
speaches, he then beganne to make performaunce of parte
thereof, at that verye instant, giuing him an <HI>Encom∣menda,</HI>
with money to put himselfe in a readinesse for that
voiage: And for to goe with him, the king also dispatched
one <HI>Paulo de la Gama,</HI> brother to the Captaine Generall,
and one <HI>Nicholas Coello,</HI> both of them the kings seruants,
and men méete and apt for whatsoeuer matter of enterprise
or cause of valiauntnesse: Moreouer he appointed one <HI>Bar∣tholome
Dyas,</HI> to goe with them in a Caruell to the <HI>My∣na:</HI>
And for that in the ships of warre, sufficient victualls
for the people in the same, could not be carried further then
to a place called Saint <HI>Blaze,</HI> where they must of course
take in fresh water, the king gaue commaundement that the
shippe of <HI>Ayres Correa</HI> should goe loaden with victuals vn∣to
that place in the companie of the Fléet, and there to take
out the same, and then to burne the said Ship. The Cap∣taine

the other Captaines from the Kings court, towardes <HI>Lish∣borne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The num¦ber of per∣sōs in this voyage.</NOTE>

no lesse to be adiudged of The Generall and other his Cap∣taines
with their people so imbarked; and by the multitude
and companie then present, commended to God and good for∣tune,
they forthwith made saile and departed: The Captaine
Generall went in the Ship called Saint <HI>Gabriel,</HI> hauing
Pilot for y<SUP>e</SUP> same, one <HI>Pedro de Alanquer,</HI> which was Pilot
with <HI>Bartholome Dyas,</HI> when he went to discouer y<SUP>e</SUP> riuer

went in the <HI>Caruell Berrio,</HI> &amp; one <HI>Gonsalo Gomes,</HI> ser∣uaunt
to the Captaine generall, went for Captaine of the
ship that carried their victuals. Thus being set forward and

any happe whatsoeuer, they should bée seuered and loose
each other, they shuld euery one make, and kéepe, their roote
or course to <HI>Cabo Verde,</HI> where they would ioyne them∣selues
together againe. And so following their voiage, they
came within eight dayes after to the sight of the Ilandes
of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> from whence going ouer against the Ri∣uer
called <HI>Ryo de Oro,</HI> the night did growe so darke, and
such great tempest and storme rose as they lost each other,
and therefore they retourned their course towardes <HI>Cabo
Verde,</HI> and <HI>Paulo de la Gama, Nicholas Coello, Bartholo∣me
Dyas,</HI> and <HI>Gonsalo Gomes,</HI> hauing met, and after eight
daies failing together, they came to sight of their Captaine
Generall, vpon the wednesdaye in the Euening, and salu∣ting
him with many shot of ordinaunce, and with sound of
Trumpets, they spake vnto him, each of them heartely re∣ioysing,
and thanking God for their safe méeting, and good
fortune in this their first brunt of daunger and perill: The

harmes they had receiued in the storme past. Tewsday be∣ing
the third day of August, the Captaine Generall depar∣ted
thence, following his course to the East, but first before

entered the goulfe into the Sea, and from thence sailed all
August, September, and October, in which time they sustei∣ned
many and great tempests, or rather torments of out∣ragious
windes and raine, so that they expected nothing but
present death, which still was represented before them by
view of the manifolde daungers and perills, they presently
then sawe, and whereof they were forced to abide the euen∣ture:
Béeing thus perplexed, God of his diuine goodnesse
recomforted them, for vpon the saturdaye, being the fourth
day of Nouember at nine of the clocke in the fore-noone,
they sawe land, whereat they greatly reioysed, and all the
Captaines béeing together, they then saluted the Generall,
all of them apparelled in their best araie, and hauing decked
and garnished their shippes with Flagges accordingly, they
drew néere the land as the generall had commaunded, who
was desirous to haue landed: Howbeit for that they did
not know the land, he commaunded them to cast about a
sea boord, and so they passed along by the same vntill tews∣daie
following, at what time they came to perfect viewe
and sight of the land, perceiuing the same to lye lowe, and
that there was a great bay, which as it was a conuenient
place for the ships, so he commanded them to fall to an an∣ker

They haue for armes or weapons certaine staues of an
Oke trée bathed or toasted with fire, at the endes whereof
are hornes of beasts, somwhat burnt or hardened with fire,
also seruing them for swoords, and wherewith they do hurt
their enimie. These people doe mainteine themselues with
rootes of hearbes, with Sea Woulfes, and Whale fish, of
which the countrie there hath great plentie, and likewise of
sea crowes, and sea mewes: Also they doe eate of beastes,
which they call <HI>Gazelas,</HI> and of doues, and other beasts and
birds which they haue in the land: They kéepe also dogs as
those ben of <HI>Portingale,</HI> barking after the same manner: The
Generall thus lyeng at Anker, commaunded to goe rounde
about the Ilande, to sée if there were anie riuer of swéete
water, and finding none, he then sent <HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> in
his boate along the coast to séeke out water, which he found
fowre leagues of from thence, the which he named <HI>Sancty
Ago,</HI> from whence the whole Fléete prouided themselues of
fresh water. The next day the Generall and the other Cap∣taines,
and some of their companie went a shore, intending
to sée and view what manner of people they were, that in∣habited
that countrie or land, and whether they coulde in∣forme
him how farre from thence the Cape of <HI>Buena Es∣peransa</HI>
was, which he knew not, neither was the head or
chiefe Pilot of that voyage of any certeintie which it was,
for that in the voyage, wherein hée went before with <HI>Bar∣tholome
Dyas,</HI> he departed in the morning from the Cape
into the Sea, and past the same in the night, with a fore∣winde,
and at his first going, came not néere the Shore:
By reason wherof he did not know the land, notwithstan∣ding,
hée coniectured and déemed it not aboue thirtie leagues
distaunt from thence at the vttermost: The Generall being
disimbarked and come to land, and walking there he ouer∣tooke
a man, one of the inhabitaunts of the same, who was
going to gather honny at the foote of a bush, where the Bées
made the same without anie hiue, with this man, y<SUP>e</SUP> general
returned vnto his ship, right well contented, thinking he had
gotten by him an interpreter, but it happened not so for ther
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
was not any of that company could vnderstand him: The
Generall commaunded to giue him meate, and he did both
eate and drinke of all that was giuen him, and when they
saw he vnderstood none of their languages, nor any of them
had any vnderstanding of his, he was the next daye set vp∣pon
the shore well apparelled, from whence he went as it
appeared, amongst others his countrey men, for that y<SUP>•</SUP> next
day then following, (vpon shew of himselfe to them) there
came about the number of fiftéene of his Countrey men,
where our ships were: At sight of which the Captaine ge∣nerall
went to lande, carrieng with him Spice, Golde, and
Pearle, to make triall, whether those people had any know∣ledge
of the same, or of any part thereof: but by the lyttle
estimation they seemed to make of those things, it appeared
they had no knowledge of the same. Then they gaue them
bells, little rings of tinne, and counters, and of these things
they wer very glad, and from thence forward vnto the next
Saterday following, very many of them repayred to our
Fléete, and those people so returning to their Townes, one
of our men desirous to sée the same, and to viewe the order
and manner of their liues, craued then licence of the Gene∣rall
to goe with them, whose petition, albeit he was verye
vnwilling to condescend vnto, yet vanquished by importu∣nitie,
he graunted the same. <HI>Fernan Veloso</HI> (for so was his
name that was licensed) then going in their company, they
tooke a Sea Woulfe, which they rosted at the foote of a hill,
and supped altogethers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treason by these men ima∣gined a∣gainst ours.</NOTE> after which it then appeared, that
they of that Countrey had armed themselues, and prac∣tised
treason against our men: for so soone as they had sup∣ped,
they caused <HI>Fernan Veloso,</HI> to returne to our Fléete a∣gaine,
which was hard by, and when he was departed from
them, they followed and came after him a little and a lit∣tle,
the manner whereof, <HI>Fernan</HI> espieng &amp; fearing, he there∣fore
hasted to the water side, and hailed to our ships: The
Generall then being at supper, and hearing that call, and loo∣king
out to landward, sawe those sauage people comming
after him, and presently imagined they meant him harme,
<PB REF="14"/>
and therefore foorthwith he commaunded the whole Fléete
to put themselues in battaile araye, and he himselfe with
certaine others, went to landward without anye weapons,
déeming verely that those blacke men meant him no harme,
nor would offer anye force: and indéede when they sawe
our boates comming to the shoreward, they began to runne
away, with a great clamour and outcrie, and so did manye
others also which lay secretly hidden amongst certeine bush∣es
there, which policie they vsed to traine our men the ra∣ther
to lande, for when ours were disimbarked and lan∣ded,
they then returned and furiously set vpon them, shooting
their darts, and vsing their other weapons in such sort, as
they inforced our men to retire to their boates and imbarke
themselues, and that in hast, taking with them <HI>Fernan Ve∣loso,</HI>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Fléete hauing taken in fresh water

and the rest then departed thence vpon the
Thursday being the sixtéenth daye of No∣uember,
in the forenoone of the same daye,
making their waye into the Sea, with a
South southwest winde, and vpon the Saterdaye then next
following in the euening, he came within sight of the Cape
of <HI>Buena esperansa,</HI> and for that the winde was contrarye,
as being then Southwest, and the Cape lyeng Northeast
Southeast, hée made his retourne into the Seawarde,
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
whilest the daye did indure, and when the night came, hée
cast about towards the shore, and so in that order he sayled
vntill the Wensdaye following, which was the twentith
day of Nouember in which time he doubled the Cape: And
going along the Coast with a fore winde, he passed with
great pleasure of sundry pastimes, and in sounding of the
trumpets in all their ships, chiefly hauing their whole con∣fidence
in God, by whose diuine furtherance, they hoped to
finde out, and attaine to that which they sought for: So
passing in this sort along that Coast, they sawe vppon the
land great store of Cattell, whereof some were large, some
small, but all of them were growen and fat: Howbeit ther
appeared to them no Townes within this lande, by reason
that along those Coasts ther are none scituated: but further
within the same, there be Townes and Villages inhabited,
the houses whereof are all of earth couered with strawe.
The people are of colour somewhat blacke, and be apparai∣led
as those of the Countrey of <HI>Sancta Helena,</HI> speaking
the selfe same language, and vsing the selfe same sorte of
darts, with some other weapons also for their defence, and
anoyaunce of their enimie. This Countrey is verye plea∣saunt
with Trées and Waters, and ioyning to this Cape
on the South side, there is a great Harbour, which reach∣eth
into the Lande sixe leagues, and at the entering it
containeth well as much more. The Cape of <HI>Buena espe∣ransa</HI>
béeing thus doubled, the Captaine Generall foorth∣with
vpon the Sundaye after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vva∣tering of S. Blaze</NOTE> which was Saint <HI>Katherins</HI>
day, came to the Watering of Saynt <HI>Blaze,</HI> which is thrée
score leagues beyonde the Cape, béeing a verie great Baye,
and passing good for all Windes, except onelye the North
winde. The people héere are somewhat blacke of cou∣lour,
they couer themselues with skinnes, they fight
with Dartes of woode tosted or hardened in the fire,
and vse for Swoordes, Hornes and Bones of Beastes,
and also they vse Stones to defende themselues agaynst
theyr Enimies. In this Lande bée manye Ele∣phauntes
and great, also Oxen manye both large of
<PB REF="15"/>
stature, and very fat, whereof some haue no hornes: and
vpon the fattest and fairest of the same, the people do vse to
ride, sadling them with pannells stuffed with the strawe of
Rye, as the manner is in <HI>Spayne,</HI> and vpon the same they
put a certaine frame of woode, and so vse it as a saddle to
ride vppon, putting through the noses of such of them as
they will sell, a péece of woode, of that kinde whereof they
make their arrowes. In this Harbour thrée Crossebow shot
from the shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea vvolfs most firce &amp; terrible beasts</NOTE> within the Sea, lieth a Rocke, in the which
there be many Sea Woulfes, which are as large in bignes
as great Beares, they be terrible, hauing great and long
téeth, also so wilde and fierce, that they do forcible set vpon
men: their skinnes be so hard that no speare can pearce the
same, albeit it be forced vpon it with great strength and va∣lure:
they are like vnto Lions, and their little ones crye
like young Goates, there be so many of them in y<SUP>•</SUP> Rocke,
that when our men went thether of pleasure one day, they
saw of them at that instant, the number of thrée thousand
little and great. In this Rocke also be many Stares, which
are as great as Duckes, but they doe not flye, by reason
they haue no feathers in their wings, and they braye lyke
vnto an Asse. The Captaine Generall being come to this
Port or Baye, and lieng at Anker there, caused the shippes
which carried their victualls, to be discharged thereof, and
bestowed the same in the others, commaunding those Ves∣sells
to be then burned, as it was ordained and commaun∣ded
by the King in that behalfe. In doing whereof, &amp; other
things also which were necessarye and néedfull to be looked
vnto, and foreséene, for their more safetie in the rest of their
voyage, they remained ten dayes in that place, where, vpon
the Friday next after the Captaine generall and the rest had
ariued, ther appeared vnto them, about the number of foure
score and ten men of that Countrey, some along vppon the
landes, and some vpon the top of their Mountaines, which
when the Generall sawe, he and other the Captaines went
to the shore ward, and all the company of the shippes went
armed in their boates, carrieng ordinaunce with them, as
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
fearing the lyke chaunce y<SUP>•</SUP> happened to them in the Ilande
of <HI>Sancta Helena,</HI> the Boates then drawing neere to the
shore, the Generall threw on lande little belles, which the
<HI>Negroes</HI> tooke vp, and some of them came so neere vnto
him, that he gaue them the bells into their owne handes,
whereat he wonderfully meruailed, for that <HI>Bartholome
Dyas</HI> had informed before, that when he was there, they did
run away, and wold not be allured to come so néere view.
The Generall therfore finding &amp; perceiuing contrary to his
expectation, the gentlenesse of those blacke people, hée then
leapt out on lande with his men, making exchaunge of cer∣taine
red night caps with the <HI>Negroes</HI> for Bracelets of I∣uory
which they had, and so for that time departed. The
Saterday next after came to the number of two hundreth
blacke men: and more, some little, some great, bringing with
them twelue Oxen and foure shéepe, and as our men went
on shore, they began to play vpon foure Flutes according∣ly
with foure sundry voyces, the Musicke whereof sounded
very well, which the Generall hearing, commaunded the
trumpets to sound, and so they daunced with our men. In
this pastime and feasting, and in buying their Oxen and
shéepe, that daye passed ouer, and in the selfe same sort, vpon
the Sunday following, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry of the same, and many moe
with them as well men as women, came againe bringing
with them many Kine, and hauing solde one Oxe, our men
saw certaine little <HI>Nigroes,</HI> which were hidden in certayne
bushes, who had with them the weapons of the greater
sort of men: wherein our men coniectured, that some trea∣son
was ment to them, and therfore the Generall comman∣ded
our people to retire to another place, which was of
more securitie, and those blacke men went all along the
shore directlye against our boates, vntill they came to the
place where ours disimbarked themselues, and went vppon
the lande in armour. The <HI>Nigroes</HI> then ioyned themselues
as though they intended to fight, which the Generall per∣ceiuing,
and not wilyng to doe them anye harme, did then
retyre, imbarking himselfe, and for to feare them, comman∣ded
<PB REF="16"/>
two brasse péeces of Ordinaunce to be shot off, where∣at
they were amazed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The little Nigroes made more a∣feard then hurt</NOTE> and ranne away without any order,
leauing their weapons behinde them. After this, the Cap∣taine
generall, caused to be carried on the shore, a certaine
marke or Piller, with the King of <HI>Portingales</HI> Armes, and
a Crosse, which being there set and erected, the <HI>Nigroes</HI> pul∣led
downe the same our men yet being there. These dayes
thus passed ouer, the Captaine generall with the rest of the
Fléete departed thence towards the Riuer called, <HI>Ryo del
infante,</HI> vpon the Friday being the eight day of Nouember,
which was the Feast daye of the conception of our Lady,
and in sailing forward on their voyage, ther arose so great
a storme with a forewinde, vpon the daye of Saint <HI>Luke,</HI>
that our whole Fléete did runne with there small sayles,
and that also verye low. In this course they lost the com∣pany
of <HI>Nicholas Coello,</HI> howbeit the next night after they
all met, and ioyned together againe. Now hauing past and
sailed through this great storm, or rather torment of wind,
which then was ceased, the Captaine Generall, vppon the
sixtéenth daye of December did discouer lande, which were
certaine small Rockes, being distaunt from the Harbour of
Saint <HI>Blaze</HI> thréescore leagues, and fiue leagues also from
the other part of the Rocke called <HI>De la cruze,</HI> where <HI>Bar∣tholome
Dyas</HI> did erect his last marke: from which place
to the Riuer <HI>Del Infante</HI> are fiftéene leagues. This Coun∣trey
is very pleasant and sightly in viewe, and in the same
is great store of Cattell, and the further our Fléete sayled
on that Coast, the better and higher the Trées were, all
which things our men might well perceiue and discerne, by
reason they went so néere the shore with their ships. And
vpon the Saterday they past hard by, and within sight of the
Rocke <HI>De la cruze,</HI> and for that they were then come so far
forward as the Riuer <HI>Del infante,</HI> they were loath to passe
the same, and thereof taking counsell all the next night,
they went somewhat wide from the Coast, with a fore∣winde,
vntill Euensong time, and then the Winde came
to the East, which was right against them, wherefore the
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
Captaine generall made to Seawarde, going in such
sort, as sometime he kept the Sea, and sometime droue to∣wards
the lande, vntill the Tuesday being the twentith of
December, at the setting of the Sunne, the winde then com∣ming
to the West, which was a forewinde, and whether
to attayne to haue knowledge of the Lande they consulted
all that night, which were best to doe. The next daye at
tenne of the Clocke in the fore noone, they came to the
Rocke aforesayde, which is thrée score leagues a stearne the
place, wherevnto they minded to goe.</P>
<P>This Rocke, is the cause of the great Currents that
are there, and the selfe same daye the Fléete through pas∣sed
the same Course, with a great forewinde, which had
also indured them thrée or foure dayes, and wherewith they
ranne through those Currents, which greatlye they fea∣red,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They safe¦ly passed the dāge∣rous cur∣rents</NOTE>
and were in doubt to haue done. These daungerous
Currents, thus safelye and happelye passed without losse
or damage, they all were very glad and ioyfull, that theyr
good Fortune was to haue passed the same in manner as
<HI>Bartholome Dyas</HI> before that time had accordinglye done.
Wherefore the Captaine generall, béeing animated and
encouraged with this his great good lucke and Fortune,
and after thankes giuen to God for the same, did then
saye, that hée verelye beléeued, that it was Gods good
will and pleasure that the <HI>Indias</HI> should be founde.</P>

which went along the Sea side, and when the Captain

to bée a people, flexible to ciuilitie, and of a quiet dispositi∣on,

who coulde speake manye languages of the <HI>Nigroes,</HI>
and one other with him, to leape out on Lande, and to
goe to them, which immediatelye those two persons did:
and at theyr comming to the same blacke People, they
were of them verye well receyued, and especiallye of the

foorthwith sent a Iacket, a payre of Hose, and a Cappe,

Generall for the same, saieng: that with a verye good
will, hée shoulde haue of gifte, anye thing he would de∣sire
or had néede off, that was to be had in his Countrey.
All which, <HI>Martin Alonso,</HI> vnderstanding theyr lan∣guage

to y<SUP>e</SUP> same <HI>Alonso</HI> &amp; one moe of our men to goe with those

The gouernour then apparelled himselfe with those Gar∣ments
which the Generall gaue him, and with great plea∣sure
gaue commaundement to many of his chiefe men to

The people as they went viewed and beheld with greate

domage done or offered them: and saw both many qui∣et

they weare many braceléets of Copper, and some péeces of
them in their haires. Also they carrie daggars, the hafts or
handles of Pewter, and the sheathes of Iuorie, so that it is
manifest, that they haue in that Countrie plentie of copper
and tinne: Moreouer they haue great store of Salt, which
they make of Salt water, carrieng the same from the Sea
side in gourds, and putting it into certeine Caues where
they make the Salt: These kinde of people were so gladde
of the linnen that our men carried with them, and brought
with them thether, that they gaue for one shirt much Cop∣per.
They also were so quiet amongest our men, that they
brought them water to their boates from a riuer which
was two Crosbowe shotte from the place where our men
tooke in the same, which riuer they call <HI>Ryo de Cobio:</HI>
From this place our Fléete departed the fiftenth daye
of Ianuarie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A nevv land disco¦uered of curteous Moores</NOTE> and going vnder saile, did discouer land of an

there to learne whether they might heare anye newes or

thicke loaden with sundrie sortes of fruites: Our men then
beholding the land, which was verie pleasaunt, they sawe
also certeine boates, at that present comming towardes

knowledge and experience of the Sea, that therefore they
were not farre of from the <HI>Indias,</HI> or at leastwise could not
then goe far, but they should heare newes of the same: when
the people with their boates came néere to our Fléete, our
men perceiued they were all blacke people, of good stature,
howbeit all naked, sauing their priuie members, which wer
couered, with little péeces of linnen made of Bomebast or
Cotten, they came neere and entered into our ships without
any feare, and in such sorte vsed themselues towardes our
men, as though they had ben of long acquaintance and fa∣miliaritie
with them: They were very well receiued of our
people of the Fléet, the Captaine Generall commanded the
same, and also that there shuld be giuen vnto them certeine
little Bels &amp; other things, &amp; he talked with them by signes,
for they did not vnderstand any of <HI>Martin Alonso</HI> his lan∣guages,
nor any other interpretour y<SUP>t</SUP> our men thē had: After
this their good interteinment they departed, and as it séemed
well liking of the same, they and many others with them
afterward returned in their boates to our ships, bringing
vnto them such victuals as their countrie yéeldeth: They
in appearance shewed themselues verie well contented with
our men, &amp; as they came by water, so also did many others
of those people repaire thether by land, &amp; amongst them wo∣men
of indifferent good beautie, especially y<SUP>•</SUP> young maides,
which goe after the same sort, that the men doe: They haue
in their lips thrée holes, and in euery hole a péece of tinne,

or nothing at all estéemed thereof: Howbeit while
they remained in our Shippes, the Generall perceiued
by tokens and signes which a young man that came with
them then shewed, that their countrie was farre of thence,
and that they had séene as great ships as ours were, wher∣of
he greatly reioysed, and all our people in like manner as
then verely hoping and thereby coniecturing, that the <HI>Indi∣as</HI>
were néere to that place: which their hope and coniec∣ture,
was also farre the more augmented and confirmed,
for that after those noble men were gone to shore, they sent
to the Fléete, certeine linnen cloth to sell, which was made
of Cotten, vpon which also were certeine marks of Okar,
in respect of which good newes, and intelligence héere found,
and likely to ensue, the Captaine Generall gaue to this ri∣uer
a name, calling it, <HI>The Riuer of the good tokens or
marks,</HI> and caused there a marke to be erected, calling the
same <HI>San Raphael,</HI> according with the name of the shippe
wherein hée was, and went that voyage. And forasmuch as
he perceiued by the signes of the young man, that those no∣ble
men inhabited a Countrie farre thence, and that they
had séene shippes as greate as ours, hée thereby and vppon
other coniectures gathered, that their Countrie was néere to
the <HI>Indias,</HI> and so consequently that the <HI>Indias</HI> was farre of
from that riuer where our ships then lay: wherefore consul∣ting
héereof, it was by him and the other Captaines then
determined vpon, that all the shippes should be brought on
ground, which determination was executed accordinglye, &amp;
the same ships repaired, dressed, and trimmed in all points
néedfull and necessarie: In dooing whereof they spent and
passed ouer two and thirtie daies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This sick¦nes is cal∣led the Scurfe</NOTE> in which time our men

could not eate, and the same so rotted, that the stinke which
came out of their mouthes was so great and pestiferous,
that none could abide the sauour therof, with this pestilent

hée had prouided, and carried with him, through whose good

then by view of their persons it appeared they were men of
a good stature and somewhat blacke. They were apparelled
in linnen cloth of Cotten, welted with sundry colours, some
girdeled vnto their knées, and others carried the same vpon
their shoulders as cloaks, and vpon their heads they weare
a certeine kinde of tucks or kerchiefe somewhat wrought
with silke and gold thrid. They haue swoords and daggers
as the Moores doe vse them, in their boates they brought
with them their instruments called <HI>Sagbuts.</HI> These men
being thus come to our ships, they forthwith came a boord

they had knowne our men a long time, and immediatlye
began to be conuersant, and very familiar with them, vsing
their speaches which they vttered in the language of <HI>Alga∣rauia,</HI>
and would not be knowne they were Moores: The
Generall commaunded to giue them meate, &amp; they did both
eate and drinke with a good wil, of whatsoeuer was giuen
them: And béeing asked at commaundement of the General
by one <HI>Fernan Aluares</HI> (who could speake y<SUP>t</SUP> language) what
land that was, they answered that it apperteined to a great
king which was before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iland of Monsā¦bick, vvith the tovvn of Mer∣chandise.</NOTE> &amp; how that Iland was called <HI>Mō∣sambicke,</HI>

perceiue and sée the truth, and more at large, touching
those thinges they then gaue information of: The Gene∣rall

debating the matter thereof, and argued whether
it were good to enter the Harbour, and sée if those things
were of truth, which those Moores had imparted to them,
and also there to take some Pilottes to carrye them

Vppon which consultation, it was there determined,
<PB REF="21"/>
that <HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> shuld first make an assay &amp; proofe for

when he should depart from our ship, he required by signes
of <HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> to haue his boat to carrie him to lande,
who gladly graunted the same, and sent therewith certaine

arriued in the Harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our men taken for Turks, by the Mores of Mon∣sambicke</NOTE> immediately sent to visite them, be∣léeuing
they were Turkes, and presented them with many

for presents to him againe, certaine red hats, short gownes,

he came and visited the Captaine Generall
who hauing knowledge of his comming, commaunded the

he ordered, that all our sicke and diseased men, shoulde

sought to betraye them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go∣uernor cō¦meth a∣bootd, &amp; the dis∣criptiō of his person and attire</NOTE> This preperation made, the Go∣uernour

carrieng him from thence, in that part of the ship, where the
same was couered ouer and trimmed in the best manner it
might then be, and many of his people with him, the rest re∣maining
that came with him in their beates. The Gouer∣nour
thus being receiued into the ship, the Generall desired
him to take no offence in that he sent to him no Scarlet,
since in truth he brought none with him: onely he declared
that he had in his ships, but such Merchaundise, as he would
giue and bestow for victualls, when his men should want
the same: and that he went in this order, only of intent to
find out &amp; discouer the <HI>Indias,</HI> by commandement of a great
&amp; mightie King whose seruaunt he was. All which things
the Generall tolde him by the mouth of <HI>Fernan Martin,</HI>
who was the Interpretour betwéene them: and then com∣maunded
to giue them such banketting meates, and wine
as were carried in the shippe, whereof he did both eate and
drinke verye well, and so in lyke manner did the other,
who came with him, all which were likewise feasted.
And as the Gouernour remayned after this, a very friend
to the Generall, so also did his people make much, and ex∣tende
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
great frindship to our men. He asked of our Ge∣nerall,
whether they came from the Turkes Countrey,
for that as he had heard saye, the people of the same are
white as ours were, requesting also to haue a sight of
their Countrey bowes, and of the bookes of theyr Lawes:
Wherevnto our Generall aunswered, that hée and his
Companye were not of the Turkes Countrey, but that
they were of a great Kingdome, which confined vppon the
same, and as touching theyr bowes and weaponnes, hée
shoulde with verye good will sée them: But as for the
Bookes of theyr Lawes, they had none there with them,
for to carrye the same, were to no purpose, since vp∣pon
the Sea, they néeded not the vse thereof. Then
were brought before him certaine Crossebowes, which al∣so
in his presence were bent and shot off, whereat hée
greatly meruayled. They also produced to sight and viewe
of him certaine harnesses or armours, whereat he also mer∣uailed
much.</P>
<P>By occasion of this méeting and feasting, the Captaine
Generall had notice and intellygence, that from thence
to <HI>Calycut</HI> were nine hundred leagues, and that it was
verye néedefull and necessarye for him to take a Pilot
of this Countrey, to conduct him and his Companye, by
reason they shoulde finde manye shoells in theyr Course
thether: and also that along the Coast there are manye
Cities: Moreouer hée vnderstoode then, that <HI>Presbiter
Ioan</HI> was farre from thence within the Countrey.</P>
<P>Now since it was so expedient to haue a Pilot, the Ge∣nerall
then requested to haue two such of the Gouernour,
who graunted and made promise of the same, vppon condi∣tion
that our men shoulde well vse and content them: Of
these Pilots so promised, our men were glad, for that if
one of them shoulde happe to dye, the other yet might
remayne and serue theyr purpose, and for that conside∣ration,
our Generall required a couple. After this time,
the Gouernour once more came to visit the General, bring∣ing

to each of which was giuen thirtie Crownes and a coate,
euery Crowne worth in money, fiue shillings, with this

Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moores withdravv ther good wils kno∣vving that vve vvere Chtistians</NOTE> wherevpon all former good will and friendship

for they practised meanes to kill our men, and so to take the

for execution of their mischeuous enterprise, which
had bene likely to haue taken place, and sorted to a sorrow∣full

to remaine no longer in that harbour. And so vpon
the Saterday, being the tenth daye of March, &amp; seuen dayes
after his arriuall there, he departed thence, and went with
his ships into the Sea, and came to an Ankor harde by an

wer thus at an Anker, the Captain general then perceiuing
the same to be in place of assurance so as the Moores should
not burne them, (whereof before he was greatly afrayde)
which now by their remooue was preuented and put out of

his boate, to demaund the other Pilot that remayned on

with the Fléete in order and readinesse to come and succour

<HI>Monsambicke</HI> carrieng with him <HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> in his

saw how there came bearing right with his boate, sixe
boates with many armed Moores, hauing long bowes &amp; ar∣rowes,
and also shieldes and speares, who when they sawe
our men, beganne then to call vnto them, willing them to
come to the harbour of their Towne. The Pilot Moore
tolde the Generall what they meant by their signes and
tokens they made, and gaue him counsell to retourne the∣ther,
for that otherwise the Gouernour woulde not delyuer
the other Pilot which remained on the shore, at which his
speach, the General was very angry, supposing he gaue that
counsell, to the ende at their comming néere the shore, hée
might escape and runne away, and therefore commaunded
him to prison, and caused foorthwith to shoote at theyr boats
with their Ordinaunce, which shot when <HI>Paulo de la Ga∣ma</HI>
heard, and beléeuing it had bene some further matter of

made away with great hast, and so fast that the Captaine ge∣nerall

The next day the Generall, with all his men went on land,
heard Masse, and receiued the Sacrament very deuoutlye,
being the night before confessed: which being done, they
all went aboord their ships, and made sayle the same day.
The Generall perceiuing no hope to remaine for recouerie
of the other Pilot, which was on shore in <HI>Monsambicke,</HI>
gaue them commaundement to release him that was in the
ship committed to prison, (as before you haue heard, whome

the King of that place, that our shippes were of the
Christians, of purpose thereby to occasion him to kill and
destroy them all: and therefore subtillie to shaddowe his
wicked intent, he willed and perswaded the Captaine ge∣nerall,
not to trouble himselfe with the want of the other
Pilot, for that he would carrie him to a great Iland, which
was from thence one hundreth leagues, and inhabited as
it were the one halfe by the Moores, and the other by Chri∣stians,
which alwaies were at wars the one with the other,
from whence also he might furnish himselfe with Pilots to
carry him to <HI>Calycut:</HI> But as the Captaine generall had
good liking of those speaches, so yet gaue he no great credite
to the man, neuerthelesse he did promise him great giftes, if
he did carrie him to that Countrey: and so went forward
on his voyage with a small winde. The Tuesdaye after,
being within sight of lande from whence he departed, hée
was incalmed, which did indure Tuesdaye and Wensdaye,
the next night after with an Easterly wind being but smal,

in the morning, founde himselfe and all the Fléete, foure
leagues backe behinde <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> &amp; so going vntill the
Euening the same day, came then to an Anker hard to that
Iland, where the Sunday next following he heard Masse.
The winde thus being contrary to his purpose of Nauiga∣tion,
he therefore remained in that place eight daies to wait
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
for such gale thereof as would serue to put him forward on
his iourney: In which time repaired to our ships a white
Moore which was a Minister of the Moores of <HI>Mons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣bicke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A vvhite Moore re¦paireth to our ships.</NOTE>
who comming on boord the ship of the Generall, de∣clared
that the Gouernour of the same Towne greatlye did
repent him of the breach of peace &amp; friendship he had made
with him, &amp; that he would gladly renew the same againe &amp;
confirme it, &amp; so remaine a friend. To whom the Generall
returned aunswere by that messenger to this effect, that he
would make no peace with the Gouernour, neither would
he be his friend, vntill such time as he did send to him his
Pilot whom he had hired and payed, with this aunswere,
the Minister departed, and neuer came againe. The Cap∣taine
generall thus staieng still there, and expecting the
winde, there came to him after the Minster was gone,
a certaine Moore, who brought his Sonne with him being
a boye, and asked the Generall whether he woulde carrye
them in his ships with him to the Citie of <HI>Mylynde,</HI> which
he should finde in the course he shoulde kéepe towards <HI>Ca∣lycut:</HI>
Declaring that he would gladly goe with him, and
returne to his Countrey which was néere to <HI>Meca,</HI> from
whence he came as a Pilot, in a ship to <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> and
therewith aduertised the Generall, not to tarry vppon any
aunswere, from the Gouernour, who he was assured would
make no peace with him, for that he was a Christian.
The Captaine was verye gladde of the comming of this
Moore, for by him hée déemed, to gather sufficient mat∣ter
of information and intellygence of the Strayghtes
of the Redde Sea, and also of the Townes that lye
and be scituated along the Coast, by the which he must
sayle to <HI>Mylynde,</HI> and therefore he commaunded to re∣ceyue
the same Moore and his Sonne into his Shippe,
and by reason it was then somewhat late, and that
they had no store of water, the Generall with the
other Captaines determined to enter into the Har∣bour
of <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> to take in there so much as they
néeded, appointing also there shoulde be great watch, for
<PB REF="25"/>
preuention of the Moores, least that they should by anye de∣uice
set on fire the ships. Vpon this determination and be∣ing
prepared accordingly, they procéeded and entered the har∣bour
on thursday, and when the night was come, they laun∣ched
out their boates to go with them for water, for the Pi∣lot
of <HI>Monsambicke</HI> informed the Generall, that it was
within the firme lande, offering to bring him to the same.
Wherevpon taking the Pilot with him, he departed about
midnight to goe thether, hauing <HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> in his cō∣pany,
and leauing <HI>Paulo de la gama</HI> in charge of the ships.
Being come to the place where the Pilot informed the wa∣ter
to be, it could not so be found, for he no doubt, went
more to make escape and runne awaye, then to perfourme
what before he promised, but whether that he was amazed
with imagination of escape, and so could not finde it, or that
of mallice (since he could not run away) he would not finde
it, he caused them to spend that night without attaining the
purpose of their repaire thether, wherefore the day light ap∣pearing,
and séeing they could not finde the water, the Ge∣nerall
would remaine no longer, hauing but a small compa∣ny
of men with him ther, and fearing least the Moores wold
set vpon him, did therefore determine to goe to his ships, of
purpose to fetch more men, and so if néed were to fight with
his enimies, knowing also he should farre better finde the
water by day then by night. So hauing bene at his ships,
and there furnished his boates with more force of men and
armour, he retourned to shore ward againe, carrieng with
him the Pilot of <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> and hauing also <HI>Nicholas
Coello</HI> in his companye as before to take in water. And
when they drew néere to the same, the Pilot séeing that hée
by no meane or deuice coulde runne awaye, did then foorth∣with
shew them the water, which was harde by the shore
side, where also then were in sight the number of twentie
Moores skirmishing with their dartes, and showing as
though they were appointed there for the purpose and wold
defende the water against such as would enterprice to fetch
or take any thereof.

away to the Moores, wherof when the General vnderstood,
he was very sad and sorrowfull for the same, since he was
a Christian: Vppon the griefe and sorrow héereof he remai∣ned
there Fridaie following: Vpon the Saturday, béeing
the xxiiii daye of March, and the euen of the Annunciation
of our Lady, early in the morning appeared vpon the shoore
side a Moore right ouer against the Fléete, who cried out
with alowde and shrill voice, saieng, that if our men wold
haue wate, they should nowe come for the same thether,
where they should finde such as would inforce them to
returne. The Captaine Generall perceiuing how small ac∣count
they made of him, remembring also the iniury done
him in not deliuering the Pilot, and therwith hauing fresh
in memorie the losse and running away of the <HI>Nigoe,</HI> his
Pilots seruant, did therevpon grow into some cholar, and
so determined to shoote of the ordinaunce of his ships, into
the towne of his enimies, thereby to be reuenged vpon the
same for the iniuries done him, by the inhabitants thereof,
and this his determination, he imparted to his Captaines,
who hauing liking of the same, yéelded therevnto, and im∣mediatly
imbarked themselues in their boates, arming the
same with such men as they had, and so comming before
the towne, and against the same, there were Moores along
the shore, which had made a pale of boords so thicke, that
our men could not perceiue who was behinde the same. And
betwéene that pale or defence and the sea, vppon the shore
there was one hundreth Moores, armed with Targets,
<PB REF="26"/>
shields, darts, bowes, arrows, &amp; slings, who so soone as our boates
came w<SUP>t</SUP>in compasse or reatch of their slings, began to send forth of
the same stones at our men, who immediatly answered them again
with shot of Ordinance, through meanes whereof they left the wa∣ters
side, retiring within their impaled defence, which was present∣ly
after beaten downe with our ordenance, &amp; the enimies running
to their towne, left behinde them two of their companie slaine in
that place: the defence thus broken downe, and the same all carried
away, the Captaine Generall with his men returned to dinner, in
which time it was straunge to see howe the Moores ran awaie by
land from that towne to another, with y<SUP>•</SUP> feare they had of our men,
and from thence they went by water to another place, which was
on the other side. After dinner our men went with their Captains
to see whether they could take any Moores, verely beleeuing that
by taking of some, they shuld for the same haue restitution of <HI>Cam∣braies

moreouer they thought to recouer two <HI>Indians</HI> which the Pilot
Moore tolde the General were captiues in <HI>Monsambicke.</HI> In this
iourney onely <HI>Paulo de la Gama</HI> did take foure Moores in a boate.
And although ther were other boats wherin many Moores were,
yet could not they be taken, for making hast to the shore, &amp; atteining
the same, they ran away, leauing their boats as a pray to our men,
who found in y<SUP>e</SUP> same much linnen cloth made of cotten, &amp; also books
of their lawes of <HI>Mahoma,</HI> which the Generall commanded to bee
safely kept: And albeit he went that day along and before the town
in his boate, as other his Captaines did in like manner in theirs,
yet could not they procure anie talke or speach with anye of the
Moores of the towne, and to goe on shoare he durst not, for that he
had but few men in number with him, wherefore for that time hee
departed thence: and the next day retourned to shoare to take in
water, which without anye resistaunce was done. Nowe beeing
without all hope to recouer the <HI>Nigro</HI> and the two <HI>Indians,</HI> the ge∣nerall

which when the Generall perceiued, he made into the Seaward, and
vpon the Fridaye which was the fourth daye of Aprill, made his
way to the Northwest, &amp; before the noone tide of the same, had sight
of a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat land, and of two Ilandes neere to the same, about which,

did recknowledge y<SUP>•</SUP> same, howbeit they said y<SUP>•</SUP> the Iland of the chri∣stians
is that of <HI>Quiloa,</HI> which was behind or a sterne vs 3. leagues,
wherwith the generall was much grieued, beleeuing y<SUP>•</SUP> certeinly they
were Christians as the Pilots had informed him, and that they had
willingly lost their course, for that the shippes should not arriue at
that place. The Pilottes shaddowing their treason made shew of a
<PB REF="27"/>
reasonable excuse, saieng, that as the winde was greate, so
were the currents swift, by reason whereof the shippes had
further made saile then they thought for: But the truth was
indéede, that they more sorrowed their missing and passing
by the Iland where they informed to be Christians, then
did our Captaine Generall: For they were verely in hope
to haue ben reuenged ther, vpon our men by death of them
all: But GOD beholding the daunger and perill meant to∣wards
them, of his diuine goodnesse and mercye deliuered
them from the same, and that by a great miracle: For if our
men had gone thether, not one of them had escaped with
lyfe, since the Generall hauing such a beliefe &amp; opinion, that
there were Christians in that Iland (as the Pilot had tolde
him) would no doubt haue gone presently on land at his ar∣riuall
there, and so thereby runne headlong into a place
where he and his people should haue bene put to slaughter:
The Generall thus sorrowing the misse of that Iland, for
that he supposed there to haue found Christians, and the
Pilots Moores in chafe with themselues for that they had
missed their course thether for purpose afore said, it was then
on each part determined, to goe back and assaie to finde the
same: neuerthelesse although they earnestly bent themselues
to attaine vnto that desired Ilande, and spent that daye in
trauell to winne their purpose therein, yet coulde they not
preuaile thereto: For still the winde was so contrarie, and
the currents so great, as doe what they could, they failed of
their wills, and were put off from arriuall there, which no
doubte was done by Gods prouidence, and of his méere
fauour and goodnesse towards our men: as not willing they
should receiue anie daunger, or susteine crueltie, or losse of
lyfe, amongest those Infidels, and therefore miraculously he
preserued our people from the effect and sequele of the ma∣lice
of those two Pilots of the Moores of <HI>Monsambicke,</HI>
which had imagined in their mindes, and trauailed to bring
to finall and execution their diuellish intent: The Captaine
generall and the other Captaines thus tossing vp and
downe, to and fro, as well with their ships, as also in their
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
mindes, determined to beare towards the Ilande of <HI>Mom∣bassa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another deuise of the Mores to destroy our men vvithall</NOTE>
in which as those two Pilots gaue information, wer
two Townes, peopled and inhabited as well with Moores

intent to deceiue our men, and to traine them thether, of
purpose there to kill them, for that in déede that Ilande
was altogether and whollye inhabited by Moores, as in
lyke manner all that Coaste is,) and therefore vnder∣standing
that from thence to <HI>Mombassa</HI> are seauentie sea∣uen
leagues, they made way to goe thether, and being then
towards Euening, they sawe a great Ilande scituated to∣wards
the North, in which the Moores Pilots sayde there
were two Townes, one of Christians, and the other of
Moores, as aforesayd. Thus they sayd and inuented to the
intent to bring our men in opinion, and make them beléeue
that there were in that Land, and those Coasts many Chri∣stians.
In this sort our ships going vnder saile, certayne
dayes, the ship called Saint <HI>Raphael</HI> by fortune one mor∣ning
two houres before daye light, came on ground vppon
certaine shoells, two leagues from the firme lande, and as
she strake on ground, they within made signes to the other
ships to take héede and beware, wherevpon they shot by the
shoells and came to an Ankor, launching out their boats to
giue succour to <HI>Paulo de la Gama</HI> Captaine in the <HI>Rapha∣el,</HI>
and perceiuing when they came to the same, that the wa∣ter
did ebbe, the Generall was meruailous glad thereof, for
then he well knew, that at the next floud the ship would be
afloate againe, so that now he lost the feare and iealousie he
had conceiued, vpon the doubt he had that she was lost.
Thus recomforted with the certaintie they saw of y<SUP>•</SUP> safetie
of the ship, they foorthwith layed into the sea many ankers.
By this time it was daye lyght, and after that it was a
lowe water, she then remained drye vpon the shore being a
Sandie ground, which was the cause she tooke no harme,
by striking vpon the same. Our men placed their Ankers
which were layd foorth right ouer against themselues, and
walked vpon the Sandes whilest the Ebbe endured.
<PB REF="28"/>
So staieng for the floud, and beholding and viewing that
Ilande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sho∣els of S. Raphael.</NOTE> so farre as they coulde sée, they gaue for name to
those Sandes, the Shoells of Saint <HI>Raphael,</HI> in respect of
the name, the shippe there so hazarded did beare. And
to certayne great Ilandes and Hilles which were within
the firme Land, directly ouer against those shoells or sands,
they gaue the name of <HI>The Hills and Ilandes of Saint Ra∣phael,</HI>
vpon the same consideration.</P>
<P>The shippe thus being drye, our men sawe two boates,
and Moores of that Country in the same comming towards
them, to sée our shippes, bringing manie swéete Orenges,
farre better then those of <HI>Portingale,</HI> and gaue the same to
our men, saieng also to the Generall, that in no wise hée
should feare anye damage that coulde ensue to the shippe
on grounde, for that when it were full Sea, she woulde
then be on floate agayne, so as at will and pleasure the
same might passe on the intended voyage thereof, with
which speaches the Generall was very glad not onelye for
the good comfort they gaue him, but also in that they came
in so good season and time opportune, and therefore he gaue
them certayne giftes, which they accepted with manye
thankes, and certayne of them vnderstanding that our
Fléete intended their Course to <HI>Mombassa,</HI> they desired
the Generall to carry them with him thether, who graun∣ted
their requests, permitted them to abide and remayne
with him, the others retourning from our Fléete to

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Generall following this voyage, did
vpon the Saterday béeing the seauenth day
of Aprill, about the going downe of the
Sunne the same daye come to an Ankor
without the Barre of the Iland of <HI>Mom∣bassa,</HI>
which is harde by the firme lande,
and is verye plentie of victualls, that is to saye, <HI>Millyo,</HI>
Rice, and Cattell, as well great as lyttle, but all well
growne and fat, chiefly their shéepe, which be all without
fayles. Also they haue manye Hennes: Moreouer, the I∣lande
is verye pleasaunt, hauing many Orchards, wherein
are planted and are growing, great store of hearbes, &amp; ma∣ny
sorts of fruites: that is to saye, Pomegranets, Figges
of the <HI>Indias,</HI> Ore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges both swéete and sower, Lymons,
and Cidrons, and in the same are manye excellent good
waters. In this Ilande there is a Citie, bearing the selfe
same name of the Ilande, being in foure degrées on the
South side, it is a verye great Citie, placed and scituated
vppon an Hill, which also is a Rocke, wherevpon the Sea
doth beate, so that it cannot bée vndermined.</P>
<P>At the entering into the Protes or Heauen there is a
Marke: and at the enteraunce vppon the Barre, there is
planted or builded a lyttle Fort, lowe and néere to the wa∣ter.
The most parte of the houses in this Citie, are buil∣ded
with lyme and stone, with the loftes thereof wrought
with fine knottes of Plaister of <HI>Paris,</HI> the stréetes therein
are verye fayre. They haue a King of themselues, and the
dwellers or inhabitaunts of the same are Moores, where∣of
some bée white, and some browne of coulour, both
men and women: it appeareth they are good men on horse∣backe.
<PB REF="29"/>
They goe gallantly arayed, especially the women, which go
apparelled in gownes of silke, and be decked and garnished
with Iewells of golde and precious stones. In this Citie is
great trade of all kindes of Marchandize. There is also a
good Harbour, where alwayes are manye shippes lieng at
Road, and from the firme land commeth thether great plen∣tie
of Honnie, Waxe and Iuorie, the Captaine Generall
thus come to the Barre of this Citie, did not then enter
foorthwith, for that it was almost night when he came to
an Ankor. But he commaunded to put foorth the flagges,
and to toll their shippes, reioycing and making great mirth,
for that their good fortune, and hope they conceyued, that
in that Ilande there dwelled manye Christians, and that
the next daye they should heare Masse on the shore. Moreo∣uer
they were greatly comforted, as hauing such confi∣dence,
that in this place they might and woulde cure and
heale all such as were then sicke amongest them, as in
truth were, almost all that were there present, albeit in
number but fewe, for all the others were dead. Yet such as
remayned and had escaped the sicknesse and diseases past,
and were not dead of the great infirmities and troubles
before in this voyage chaunced vnto them. Being thus at
an Ankor, and the night almost approched, our men saw a∣bout
an hundred men in a great Barcke, euery one of them
hauing a Sworde and a Target, who at their comming to
our shippes, woulde haue entered therein with all theyr
weapons: howbeit the Generall would not consent there∣to,
neither permitted he anye more to enter then foure of
them, and those also without weapon, declaring to them in
their language that they shoulde pardon him since he was
a straunger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certaine of the in∣habitants of this city came aboorde the ship.</NOTE> and therefore coulde not tell whom he might
trust, and vnto those whom he gaue license to enter aboorde
his ship, he gaue good and gentle entertainment, banketting
the same with such Conserues as they had, (whereof those
Moores did well eate) willing them not to déeme euill of
him, for his denyall of theyr enteraunce in manner a∣foresayde,
where-vnto they aunswered, that theyr
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
comming then was to sée him as a rare and new thing in
that their countrie, and that he shoulde not meruaile to see
them bring theyr weapons, since it was the custome &amp; vse
of the same to carrie them as well in peace as in the time of
warre: also they further declared vnto the generall, that the
king of <HI>Mombassa</HI> did vnderstand of his comming, and for
that it was so néere night, he had not then sent to visit him,
howbeit the next day he would, and that as he was glad of
his arriuall there, so also would he be more glad to see him,
yea, and to giue him spices to load his ships, furthermore,
they informed him that there were many Christians, which
liued by themselues in that Iland: wherevpon the General
was not onely ioyfull, but also fullye perswaded that their
report thereof was true and vnfeined, since the same was
agréeable, and accorded with the information and talke of
the two Pilottes, neuerthelesse he carried some sparke of
iealousie in his head and for all their faire speaches and su∣gured
talke, he wisely imagined y<SUP>•</SUP> those Moores, came to sée
whether they might, by anie traine take one of our ships,
wherein he gessed vpon the truth, for certeinly their com∣ming
then was onely for that purpose, as afterward it was
made apparant. For most true it was y<SUP>•</SUP> the king of <HI>Mom∣bassa</HI>
did know and had perfect intelligence that we were
Christians, and also what we had done in <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> &amp;
therefore he practised meanes to be reuenged of vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Svvete practises of sowre treason.</NOTE> by ta∣king
our ships and killing of vs, wherefore prosecuting his
wicked intent therein, the next daie following, which was
Palme sundaie, he sent to our Generall certeine white
Moores, which declared to him y<SUP>•</SUP> their king was very glad
of his comming thether, and that if he wold come into his
harbour, he would liberally giue him all things he stoode in
néede off, and for assurance of the same he sent him a ring,
a shéepe, and many swéete Orenges, Cidrons, and Sugar
canes, giuing also these Moores instructions to tell him fur∣ther,
that they were Christians, and that in the Iland were
many christened people: All which they did in such sorte
counterfai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and with so great and déepe dissimulation, that
<PB REF="30"/>
our men thought verely they were Christians: wherefore
the Generall receiued them very well, and gaue them cer∣teine
giftes, sending to the King greate thankes for his
gentle and liberall offer, saieng further, that the next day
he woulde come néerer in: Hée sent also to the King a
braunch of Corall verye fine, and for more assuraunce
to confirme the same, he sent with those Moores two of
our men, which were banished persons, and were car∣ried
of purpose to bée aduentured in such like respect of
daunger, or to be lefte and putte on shore in such places,
where it shoulde be thought good to vnderstande some∣what,
and then to returne and be taken in againe, when
our men and the two Moores were gone: and come to the
shore, there met them a multitude of people to sée them, all
which went with them and viewed them, euen to the kings
Pallace, where our men béeing entered, they passed through
thrée doores before they came where the king was, at each
of which there was a Porter attending, hauing euerye
one of them a swoorde in his hand. They found the King
but in small estate, neuerthelesse hée receiued them verye
well, and commaunded that in the selfe same companie of
the Moores with whome they came, they should be shew∣ed
the Citie, and carried about the same in going and view∣ing
whereof, they sawe in the stréetes many men Priso∣ners
&amp; in yrons, but because our men vnderstoode not their
language, nor they had any vnderstanding of ours, there
was no question demaunded by our two messengers, what
Prisoners those were, howbeit they beléeued the same to
bée Christians, for that our Generall was informed by the
two Pilottes, and the Kinges messengers, (as you haue
before hearde) that there were in that Ilande such Chri∣stians,
which also had warres with the Moores.</P>
<P>Moreouer they carryed our men to the Merchauntes
house of the <HI>Indias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Merch̄ts of the In∣dias vvhich are Chri∣stians</NOTE> which were Christians, who hauing
information that ours also were people Christened, shew∣ed
themselues to be ioyfull thereof, both imbracing and
banketting them, shewing them painted in a Paper, the fi∣gure
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
of the holy Ghost, the which they did worshippe, and
before them made their Prayers vppon theyr knées, and
that with such a counteuaunce, and shew of greate deuo∣tion,
as though they were such men inwardlye indéede, as
in appearaunce outwardlye they then pretented, and made
shewe off: Furthermore, the Moores then tolde our men
by signes, that manye other Christians as those were, did
dwell in another place farre from thence, and therefore
they would not carrie them thether: howbeit they sayde,
that after our Captaine Generall were come into the
Porte or Harbour, they shoulde goe and sée them.
All these thinges those wilie people, shewed and imparted
to our men, of purpose to deceiue them and to allure them
to come within that Porte, where they were determined
to destroy and kill them all.</P>
<P>After they had séene the Citie, they were then brought
to the presence of the King, who commaunded to shew them
Pepper, Ginger, Cloaues, and Wheate, giuing them of
euerye sorte thereof some portion to be carryed and shew∣ed
the Generall, and sent him worde by his messenger,
that of all those commodities he hadde greate store, and
woulde giue him his loading if that hée woulde. Also that
he had Golde, and Siluer, Amber, Waxe, Iuorye, and
other riches, in so greate plentie, that hée shoulde haue
and finde there when hée woulde for lesse valour and pri∣ses,
then in anie other place.</P>
<P>This Message was brought to our Captaine Gene∣rall
vppon Mundaye, who hauing séene the Spices, and
hearing of the Kinges promise, to furnishe him the same,
and to lade him therewith, was meruailous gladde of
that offer, and so much the rather, was hée confirmed in
opinion of good lucke, for that our two banished men,
hadde gathered such intelligence, and made him so full
and good declaration of the People, Citie, and Lande
there, and chiefelye of the two Christians, they
founde in the House of the Merchauntes of the <HI>In∣dias.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="31"/>
Wherefore he &amp; his Captaines immediatly aduised them∣selues
thereof, and so entering into counsel for the same, it
was by them thought good, to come within the port, and to
accept the offer of Spices, and afterwarde to goe on theyr
voiage to <HI>Calicut,</HI> where if they could not haue the like,
they would remaine content, with that they should haue in
this place, and thus hauing concluded vppon these pointes,
they determined to enter into the harbour the next daie: in
this meane while came certeine Moores to our ships with
so great quietnesse, and humilitie, and with such shew and
appearance of friendlinesse and loue, as though they had ben
of long acquaintance and familiaritie with our men: The
next day following in the morning, y<SUP>•</SUP> floud being come, the
Generall commanded to take vp their Ankors, minding to
enter the harbour, but God not willing that he and the rest
should enter into that present mischiefe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God sent them fa∣therly checks to keepe thē frō vtter destructiō</NOTE> nor to ende theyr
liues in that place (as the Moores had determined they shuld
haue done,) did therefore cause and prouide the meane that
preuented that perill, and wrought their safetie: For when
the Generalls ship had wayed her Ankor, and was going
to enter the port, she strake vpon a shoel that was asterne
the same, which hap when he perceiued, and fearing hée
should cast himselfe away, he then forthwith commanded,
to let fall his Ankor, &amp; in like sort did the other Captaines
also: which chance when the Moores that were in the ships
sawe, &amp; that the Generall was come to an ankor, they then
imagined that during that daye, they shoulde not gette the
Fléete into the harbour, and therefore they ran to theyr
boate, which they had on the ships side to goe to the Citie,
at which instant also the Pilots of <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> falling
a stearne the Admirall, tooke the water, and those of the
boate tooke them in and carried them away with them, al∣though
the Generall called vnto them, requiring them to
bring backe, and deliuer them to him againe: But when he
sawe they would not so doe, then he apparantlye perceiued
that ther was an euill meaning in their King and them, to∣wards
him and his, and that it was his great goodnesse and
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
fauour to giue him cause of staye, by happening vppon that
shoell, thereby to preserue him from their treason imagi∣ned,
and put in practise: Thus hauing declared to all his
company, the opinion he conceiued of that which then be∣fore
their eyes was done, and appeared to be deuised and
wrought against them, he then commaunded the night bee∣ing
come, to giue some torments or torture, to two of the
Moores, which he brought captiues with them from <HI>Mon∣sambicke,</HI>
thereby to sée whether they had practised any tre∣son,
and to inforce them to open and disclose the same:
which commaundement being obserued, and put in execu∣tion,
by heating and dropping of bacon vppon their flesh,
they immediately confessed, they had conspired treason, and
that the Pilots tooke the Sea, as fearing the same had ben
disclosed: wherevpon the Generall, altogether altered his
minde and purpose of going into that Harbour. Neuerthe∣lesse
being vnquiet and greatly gréeued at their falshood, he
was desirous to vse lyke torture to another Moore captiue
also: to make tryall whether he were of counsell and in
consort with the rest.</P>
<P>But this Moore perceiuing preparation made for that
purpose, did cast himselfe his hands being bound, into the
sea, as in lyke manner another of them did, before it was
daye light. The secrecie of the mischiefe prepared, being
thus come to apparaunt view, and so discouered, the Gene∣rall
gaue great thankes to God, by whose only goodnesse, he
and his company were delyuered from imminent death and
slaughter amongst those Infidells, and therefore in contem∣plation
and thankes giuing for the same, he and his com∣pany
béeing aboord the Admirall, sayd the <HI>Salue Regina.</HI>
After this being mindfull of their safetie, and fearing least
the Moores would attempt some matter against them in the
night time, they therefore ordained strong and diligent
watch, commaunding euerye man to watch armed: And
héere by the way is to be noted one thing, and that to bee
meruayled at, which is this: That when our men came
first before the Towne of <HI>Mombassa,</HI> all such amongest
<PB REF="32"/>
them as then were sicke, (which indéede were many) began
then presently to be whole: so that in this time of theyr
great necessitie, and daunger, they felt and found themselues
sound and strong, which as it was past all hope and expec∣tation
of man, and farre aboue the common course of Na∣ture,
and operation of the same, so the more liuely it appea∣red
to be the meruailous and supernaturall worke of God,
and therefore miraculously done at this instant time of ne∣cessitie,
when his diuine power was to be séene and exten∣ded,
for the preseruation of that poore distressed number,
which then had their onely affiaunce in him. The watch
thus prepared and set for that night, it fortuned that those
which watched in the shippe <HI>Berrio,</HI> felt the gabell of the
same wagging, whereat an Ankor lay into the Sea, and at
the first they adiudged that the gabell had bene wagged or
shaken by a kinde of Fish called a <HI>Tunnie</HI> whereof ma∣ny
were there about which be very great and good meate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tunnie good meate &amp; plentifull in the coast of Mōbassa.</NOTE>
but giuing better and more attentiue eare thereto, they then
perceiued that their enimies were at the same, who in truth
did swimme about the gabell, and were cutting of it with
their woodkniues or fawchings, and hoping or rather vere∣ly
knowing, that perfourming their enterprise thereof the
shippe would runne a shore, and so both she and our men in
the same be cast away and taken: For by any other deuise
they coulde not accomplish their willes, and therefore they
practised this meane. Howbeit our men hauing discryed
whereabout they were, preuented them, by crieng out and
calling to the other shippes, showing what was in dooing,
and willing them also to beware and looke to the same,
wherevpon they of the shippe <HI>Raphael,</HI> came presentlye to
their succour and rescew, finding some of their enimies a∣mongst
the cheines of the tacklings of their formast, who
perceiuing how they were discouered, sodainly cast them∣selues
vnder water, and with the others that were cutting
the gabell of the shippe <HI>Berrio,</HI> fledde away swimming to
certaine boates, which they had lyeng somewhat farre off,

our men were greatlye troubled, and put in

then lykely by all coniecture of man, that they should haue
destroyed and killed vs all. It was coniectured that they
béeing in feare of the Ordinaunce in our shippes, durst
not giue attempt to set vppon the same by force, but what∣souer
cause appeared in our sightes to bée a lette in that

was God his good will and fauour, to put their hearts

This message thus declared, the Captaine Generall yéel∣ded

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He last day of the eight after Easter, dinner
being done, the King of <HI>Mylynde</HI> came in
a great boate hard to our Fléete, apparelled
in a Cassocke of Crimson Damaske, lined
with gréene satten, hauing vpon his head a
rich towell. He was sitting in a chaire, such
as was vsed in olde time, very well made and wrought
with wire, being in sight very faire, and in the same was
a cushion of silke, and another like vnto that hard by him,
which was couered with a hat of Crimson satten. There
stood hard by him as his Page, an olde man, who carried a
very rich sword, the scabered wherof was siluer: he brought
with him manye Shagbuts, and two Flutes of Iuorie,
which were eight spans of length each of them, they were
very well wrought, and vppon the same they played by a
little hole that is in the midst thereof, agréeing and accor∣ding
well with the shagbuts. There came with the King,
about the number of twentie Moores Gentlemen all richly
apparelled. The King now being come néere to the ships,
the Captaine generall came forth to méete him in his boat
well trimmed and set out with all his flagges, and he him∣selfe
comely araied, withall his best apparell, carrieng with
him twelue of the most principall men of his shippes, his
brother onely except, whom he left with charge of y<SUP>e</SUP> same.
The boates of each part being come néere together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mee∣ting of the king of Mylind and the Captaine generall.</NOTE> and the
one making countenance of friendly salutation &amp; entertain∣ment
to the other, the King then said to the Generall, that
he would speake with him in his owne boat, of purpose to
sée &amp; view him the better, whervpon foorthwith he receiued
him into his boat, the King then giuing to the Generall as
great honour &amp; curtesie as though he had also ben a King:
he very earnestly noted &amp; beheld him &amp; his men, as a strange
sight and matter to him and his people: he required the Ge∣nerall
to tell him the name of his King, and being tolde, he
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
commaunded the same to be then presently written: he al∣so
inquired matter perticularly of him, &amp; of his power, wher∣vnto
the Generall aunswered, and in euerye point satisfied
his demaund, declaring also for what cause y<SUP>e</SUP> king his ma∣ster
had sent him to discouer <HI>Calicut,</HI> which was to haue
from thence spices, whereof in his dominion &amp; countrey was
none. And after he had thus talked with the King &amp; infor∣med
him somewhat of the same &amp; of the straights of y<SUP>e</SUP> red
Sea, the King then promised to him a Pilot to carry him to
<HI>Calicut,</HI> &amp; also very earnestly desired him to goe with him
into his Citie, there to take his pleasure, &amp; solace himself in
his Pallaice, saieng it was néedfull &amp; necessary, after so ma∣ny
troubles, in so long a voyage sustained, to vse some re∣creation,
and take some rest: further then promising, that if
he would so do, that afterward he in like manner would go
with him to sée his ships, &amp; make merry in the same, wher∣vnto
the Generall aunswered, that he had no license of the
King his Master to go a shore, &amp; therefore if he shuld varie
from his Princes wil &amp; commaundement therein, he shuld
then giue an euill accompt of himselfe, to which excuse the
King replied, saieng, that if he shuld go to sée his ships, what
accompt should he then make to those of his Citie, or what
might they déeme &amp; adiudge of him therein: yet notwith∣standing
he said, y<SUP>t</SUP> it was a griefe to him y<SUP>t</SUP> he refused to go
with him to his Citie, which was &amp; shuld be at y<SUP>e</SUP> comman∣demēt
of him &amp; of y<SUP>e</SUP> king his master, to whom he wold send
his Embassador or els write, if he wold come y<SUP>t</SUP> way at his
returne from <HI>Calicut.</HI> The General yéelding thanks to the
King, promised him to returne y<SUP>•</SUP> way, &amp; whilest they were
thus talking there, did send for those Moores, which he had
taken captiues, and gaue them to the King, saieng that if
he could do him any further pleasure, he would gladly doe
the same: with which gift the King was so content, that he
said, he did more estéeme of the same, then if he had giuen
him such another Citie as that of <HI>Mylynde</HI> was.
Now hauing ended their talke and confirmed the friendship
betwéene them, the King then rowing amongst our ships,
<PB REF="37"/>
and behelde the same, with great pleasure and admiration▪
out of which great store of shot of Ordinaunce passed,
wherewith they were greatlye delyghted, all which time
our Generall went with him, to whom he declared, that he
neuer saw any men of whom he tooke so great pleasure, as
he did of those of <HI>Portingall,</HI> whereof he woulde gladye
haue some with him, to helpe him in his warres, which
he hath sometime with his enimies: for it well appeared
they were men apt to offend their enimie, and to abide and
suffer any trauell or paine, that should happen vnto them.
To which his speaches the Generall aunswered, that if hée
had experience of their doings, he woulde then a great
deale better lyke of them, and further that they would helpe
him, if the King his Master would sende his ships of warre
to <HI>Calicut,</HI> as he doubted not but he would, if it wer Gods
good pleasure to permit the same to be discouered. After the
King had in this sort solaced himself, he then desired the
General, that since he would not go with him to his Citie,
he shuld then let him haue two of his men to go and sée his
Pallaice, and for pledge of the same, he would giue him his
sonne, and one of his chiefe Chaplaines, the which they call
<HI>Cacis,</HI> wherevnto the Generall yéelded and appointed two of
our men to go with the King, who at his departure, reque∣sted
the Generall that the next day he would goe along in
his boate hard by the shore, where he shuld sée his horsmen
running, &amp; so they departed for that time, the next day being
Thursday, the Captaine generall &amp; <HI>Nicholas Coello,</HI> went
in their boates armed along the shore, the one somewhat di∣stant
from the other, betwéene whom vpon the shore were
many men on horsebacke skirmishing, &amp; as our boats appro∣ched
néere the shore, there came certaine footemen downe
certaine stayres of stone from the Kings house, which was
in sight, where they tooke the King vp in a chaire, and ca∣ried
him verye néere to the Boate of the Generall, to
whom he spake verye louing wordes, and once more re∣quested
him to enter vpon land, and go to his Citie, for that
his father being a lame man, was desirous to sée him, and
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
that whilest he should remaine on shoare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ge∣nerall vvould not con∣sent to go on lād at Mylynde</NOTE> both he and his
children would enter and abide in his ships. But our Ge∣nerall,
fearing least vnder such sugred speach some bitter
baite might lie couered, did therfore still excuse himself for
going on land, alleadging hée must obey his Prince, who
gaue him no license or commission so to do at anie time.
And so taking his leaue of the king, hée went a while hard
by the ships of the <HI>Indias,</HI> shooting off much Ordinaunce,
who when they sawe vs passe by lifted vp their hands, sai∣eng:
<HI>Christe, Christe,</HI> and that night with the kings license

béeing the. 21. day of Aprill, from the king, a man that was
in great credit with him, to visite the Captaine Generall,
who at that instant was very sad and heauie: for that it
was then two daies since any man came to the Fléet from
the Citie, by reason whereof he feared least that the king
were offended with him, as taking occasion of offence, for
that he refused to go on shoare, supposing also that he wold
therevppon, breake the peace and league made betwéene
them, for which he was sorrowfull, especially since as yet
he had no Pilots. And when he sawe, that he which was
so great with the king, did bring him no Pilots, he then
began to haue some iealousie, and suspition of the king, who
being informed therof, and knowing the Generall remai∣ned
there for that cause, did therefore forthwith send him
a Pilot, a Gentile (called in their language <HI>Gosarate</HI>)
whose name was <HI>Canaca,</HI> making excuse that hée had not

by Moores which were great Merchaunts, and so rich, that
some of them had fiftie ships. There is no such season of

cause, for alwayes in the same house there must be and is,
a King to serue those Idolles, and when he that serueth
there doeth dye, then must the King that then raygneth
and gouerneth, leaue his Empire, and goe serue in that

refuse to goe into the <HI>Pagode,</HI> (the King that then

These Kings of <HI>Malabar</HI> be browne men, and goe naked
from the gyrdell vpwarde, and from thence downewarde,
they be couered with cloath of silke and of Cotten: some∣time
they put vppon them shorte gownes, which they doe

very rich stones: and especiallye the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> ex∣celleth
in those attires and Iewells. They be shauen,
leauing vpon the vpper lip as the Turkes vse, the hayre
vnshauen. They be serued but with small estate, especi∣allye
at theyr meate, whereof they haue but lyttle:
But the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> is serued, with greater E∣state.</P>

alwayes leaue hir and such children as they haue by hir, be
not taken or accompted for theyrs, neither doe they inhe∣rite
the Kingdome, nor anye thing of theyrs.</P>
<P>After they be men, they are had in no more estimation,
then that is incident vnto them from the mothers bloud and
parentage. Their brothers doe inherite if they haue any, if
not, then their sisters children shall, who doe not marry, nei∣ther
yet haue any certaintie of their husbands. They bée
very frée and at libertie, to choose those of whom they lyke,
and be such as are best estéemed of. They haue verye great
rents allowed them: and when anye of them come to the
age of ten yeares, (for at that time they are to be knowen
of men) their kinred then doe sende forth out of this king∣dome,
for a young man <HI>Nayre,</HI> and presenting him with
gifts, earnestly request the same to take hir virginitie, who
then receiueth hir with great ioy, and after she is thus vsed,
doth tye about hir necke a Iewell, which she doth carry and
weare alwayes during hir life, as a thing in great estima∣tion,
&amp; for a token of the libertie giuen hir by that act, to do
with hir bodie afterward for euer, what she will: for with∣out
this manner of ceremonie, they may not know any mā.
These Kings sometimes haue warres one with another, &amp;
they in their owne persons goe into the fieldes, yea, and if
néed so require, they also fight: when they die, they be caried
out from their pallaice into a plain field, wher they be bur∣ned
with great quantitie of wood of sanders &amp; a swéet wood
called <HI>Aguila.</HI> At this burning are alwaies present all his

And they make staye of him from burning after his
death thrée daies, that they all may repaire thether &amp; come
together, to sée and viewe whether he came to his death na∣turallye,
or whether he were killed: for if he dyed by
force of anye mans hande, then are they bounde to
take reuenge thereof.</P>
<P>After hée is burned, and all the ashes buryed, they
doe all shaue themselues without leauing any hayre, yea,
euen of the least childe that is a Gentile.
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
All of them in generall doe then cease from eating of <HI>Be∣tele,</HI>
during the space of thirtéene daies, and he that doth
eate the same infringeth their law, and therefore they wil
cut his lips, and that by iustice: In all this time, the prince
which shall succéed doth not command nor gouerne, which
is done of purpose, to sée whether in that time anye man
will come to saie or obiect any thing against him. These
things and daies, thus done and past, the noble men of the
Countrie doe cause him to bée sworne, to all those lawes &amp;
customs, which were made by his predecessour, and to pay
all his debts: Also that hée shall trauaile to recouer what∣soeuer
things of his kingdome before were lost: This oath
he taketh hauing his swoorde in his lefte hande, and in the
right hande a Candle burning, which hath a ring of golde
vppon it, which he toucheth with two of his fingers, and so
taketh his oath. This being done, they throwe or powre
vpon him a few graines of Rice, with many such other ce∣remonies,
in dooing whereof they say many prayers, and
he worshippeth then the Sunne, three times, which so done,
the <HI>Caymayles,</HI> that be Lords by parentage doe immediat∣ly
holding the selfe same Candle, sweare to be true subiects
vnto him.</P>
<P>The thirtéene daies béeing ended, they all then doe
eate <HI>Betele</HI> againe, and flesh and fish as before, the king
onely except, who then taketh thought and sorroweth for
the death of his predecessour: whose manner of mourning
is thus: He must not by the space of one whole yeare, eate
any flesh or fish, or yet <HI>Betele,</HI> neither must he shaue his
beard, nor cut his nailes, nor eate but once in a daie, and
must wash himselfe all his bodie ouer, before he doe eate,
and praie certeine houres in the daye: After the yeare is
past and ended, he then vseth a certeine ceremonie for the
soule of the king his predecessour, which is much like to our
Dirge, whereat are assembled an hundreth thousand per∣sons,
at which time he giueth great almes, when this ce∣remonie

The men of warre which the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> &amp; the other
kings haue, are <HI>Nayres,</HI> which be all Gentlemen, and are
appointed to no other office or affaires, but to fight when
néede requireth. They be all Gentiles, and carrie their ar∣mour
wherewith they fight themselues, which is bowes,
arrowes, speares, daggers made like a hooke, and targets,
and march with them very honourably and gallantly, but
they goe naked, carrieng onely certeine linnen cloth of cot∣ten
painted, with the which they couer themselues from
the girdle to the knée, they are bare footed: and weare vppon
their heads certeine towels. They all liue by the king, and
by the noblemen of the countrie, of whome they haue ordi∣narie
stipends and allowaunce for their maintenaunce:
They doe so greatly estéeme and make account of theyr
gentrie, and of their cleanlinesse, that they will not touch a∣ny
husbandman, neither permit any of them to come into
their houses. The husbandmen are bound when they goe
in the stréetes to crie with a lowde voyce, and saye, <HI>Hoo
they goe,</HI> for if these Gentlemen doe come, and bid them
goe out of the way, and they doe not obey their commaun∣dement
therein: then may they kill them: The king cannot
make Gentlemen, except they be of the stocke of Gentle∣men.
They serue very well and faithfully, with them of
whome they haue their interteinment, and vnder whose
obeysaunce they liue, not sparing by night nor daie, anye
opportunitie of time for shewe of their best indeauour in
seruice of the same, nor making anye account of meat
or of theyr person or of sléepe, whensoeuer their trauell or
dilligence, may take effect or purpose of well doing. They
haue so small charge and occasion of expence, that with
halfe a crowne a péece (which is their ordinarie allowance
for one moneth) they may very well and sufficiently, main∣teine
themselues, and each of them a boye to serue him.
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
The <HI>Nayres</HI> by the law of the country, cannot marry, and
for that cause they haue no children certain, but those which
they haue are begotten of Lemmans, with which thrée or
fowre of them do lie, by accord &amp; agréement had and deter∣mined
amongest themselues, hauing one woman onelye to
serue that purpose, vnlesse any cause or quarrell growe a∣mongest
them, and euerye one of them shall be with her a
whole daie, accompting from the one halfe of the daye pre∣sent
wherein he commeth, to the other halfe of the day next
following, at which time he departeth from hers, and then
commeth another, who continueth the lyke time: Thus
they passe ouer and spend their life time without care and
trouble of wife and children: They mainteine their lem∣mans
verie well according to their degrées and birth. And
if any of them will at any time leaue and forsake her, they
may at their pleasure doe it, and likewise she maye refuse
anye of them at her will. These women are all Gentle∣women,
for the <HI>Nayres</HI> amye not take anye Countrie wo∣men,
and they also doe not marrie: And for that there bée
so many men to one women, they take not them for theyr
children which bée begotten of her, although the same bée
lyke vnto them: and therefore theyr brothers children, doe
inherit their lands, and haue their goods: This lawe that
these Gentlemen shoulde not marrie, the king ordeined and
made, for that they hauing no wiues nor children, on whom
they should haue care and fixe their loue, might the better
indure the warres, and liue at more libertie to serue in the
same.</P>
<P>And because they are Gentlemen, and that they should
be the more animated and incouraged to liue in that order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cali∣cutiās kill no kine for they vvorship them.</NOTE>
and to serue well, they be so priuiledged, that none of them
can be imprisoned for any cause, nor be put to death by a∣ny
meane of ordinarie iustice: Howbeit when one of them
doth▪ kill another, or else doth kill a Cowe, (which amongst
them is taken for a greate sinne, for that they worshippe
them) or sléepe or eate with a countrie woman, or speake
euill of the king.
<PB REF="43"/>
Then will the king, hauing true information of any of these
offences, giue out his warrant in writing vnder his owne
hand, directed to one <HI>Nayre,</HI> commaunding him therby, that
he with two or thrée other, doe forthwith kill the <HI>Nayre,</HI>
that hath so offended and sinned contrarie to the Law: By
vertue of which warrant, they hew and cut him with their
swoords, wheresoeuer they doe finde him, and when he is
dead, they hang vpon him the kings writing, to the end that
all men may know and vnderstand wherefore they killed
him: These <HI>Nayres</HI> cannot take their weapons, nor enter
into any combat, before they be armed knights: when they
atteine to the age of seauen yeares, they bée forthwith set to
learne to play at all weapons; &amp; to the ende they should bée
very perfect, their Maisters doe hale and wrest the ioyntes
of their armes, and afterward they teache them their fence
such as bée apt for the same: The weaponnes that are

ordeined: and further all of them are bound to take at their
hands a lesson two monthes in euery yeare, during theyr
liues: By reason whereof they be very perfect and skilful
in theyr weapons, and for that cause they greatly estéeme
of themselues.</P>
<P>When any of them will be an armed knight, hée then
goeth well accompanied with all his kinred and friends, &amp;
presenteth himselfe before the king, to whome he first offe∣reth
thréescore Fannons of golde, which is a certeine kinde
of money amounting to the value of thrée crownes. Wher∣vpon
the king doth immediatly aske him, whether he will
kéepe and obserue the order and custome of the <HI>Nayres?</HI>
Wherevnto he aunswereth and saith, yea. Then hée com∣maundeth

to liue and serue any King or Noble man, they binde them∣selues
to dye with him, and for him: which bond they doe
so well obserue and inuiolably kéepe, that if their Master in
any warre or otherwise be slaine, they will fight vntill they
are killed, which hath done the same acte, and if at that in∣stant
they cannot accomplish their wills, for that they were
not present at the déede doing, then will they goe afterward
and séeke them out, and neuer leaue them till they be killed
by some manner of deuise. They be great southsayers, they
haue good dayes and bad dayes, they worship the Sun, the
Moone, the fire, and the Kine, and the first that they do méet

they déemed) he did not vnderstand the <HI>Algarauia</HI> language:
Neuerthelesse going with him in this manner, and verelye
yet beléeuing he was a Moore, they caried him to the house
of two Moores,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bontaybo a More of Barbarie, dvvelling in Calicut</NOTE> which were naturally borne in <HI>Tunys</HI> in
<HI>Barbarie,</HI> and were then come to dwell in <HI>Calicut.</HI> To
whom being brought, one of them whose name was <HI>Bon∣taybo</HI>
could speake the Spanish tongue, &amp; did well knowe
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
the <HI>Portingals</HI> as he said afterward, hauing séene them in
<HI>Tunys</HI> in the time of y<SUP>e</SUP> King <HI>Don Ioan</HI> in the ship called
<HI>Lareyna</HI> which the same King sent thether manye times
to séeke for such things as he and his subiects hadde néede
of. And as soone as the banished man was entered into
their house, the Moore spake vnto him and sayd: <HI>I giue thee
to the Diuell, who brought thee hether,</HI> which words was
vttered in y<SUP>e</SUP> Spanish tongue. And after he asked him what
way he had gone and trauailed, that he was come to this
place: wherevnto the banished man aunswered &amp; told him,
shewing also, how many ships the Generall had ther, wher∣at
<HI>Bontaybo</HI> meruailed, and wondred how they could come
by Sea thether. Then he asked him what they sought so
farre off? And he aunswered that they came to séeke Chri∣stians
and spices. Moreouer <HI>Bontaibo</HI> asked why y<SUP>e</SUP> Kings
of <HI>Fraunce</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> &amp; the Duke of <HI>Venice</HI> did not also
sende thether? Whereto the banished man made aunswere,
that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> y<SUP>e</SUP> King of <HI>Portingale</HI> would not giue his consent they
should so doe: <HI>Bontaybo</HI> replieng thereto, sayde, that he did
well &amp; wisely therein. Thus hauing talked a while, he gaue
him very good entertainment, and commaunded to giue him
certaine Cakes, made of the flower of Wheate, which the
<HI>Malabars</HI> do call <HI>Apes,</HI> and with the same honnie. After be
had well eaten, <HI>Bontaybo</HI> aduised him to go to the ships, &amp;
said he would goe with him, (as indéede he did) to see y<SUP>e</SUP> Cap∣taine
generall. And being come to the Admirall which was
then entered, <HI>Bontaybo</HI> then began to say to the General in
Spanish: Good lucke, good lucke, many Rubies, many Eme∣raulds:
thou art bound to giue great thankes to God, for
that he hath brought thée where there is all kinde and sorts
of spices, stones, and all the riches of the worlde.</P>
<P>When they hearde him so saye, they all meruayled
greatlye thereat, for they before woulde not haue be∣léeued,
that there hadde béene anye man so farre off
from <HI>Portingale,</HI> that coulde vnderstande theyr lan∣guage.</P>
<P>Wherefore with wéeping teares which they then plentiful∣ly
<PB REF="45"/>
shed for ioye and pleasure they had conceiued, as well
for the same, as also for their safe and happie arriuall there,
they then gaue to God most humble and heartie thankes
through whose onely fauour, good will, and pleasure, that
good lucke and great good benefite, had happened to them.
And then the Generall imbraced <HI>Bontaybo,</HI> and caused him
to sit downe by him, asking him if he were a Christian, and
how he came to <HI>Calicut?</HI> For aunswere whereto y<SUP>•</SUP> Moore
told him of whence he was, and what he was, and how he
came to <HI>Calicut</HI> by the way of <HI>Cayro,</HI> also he shewed him
by what meanes he came to knowledge of <HI>Portingals,</HI> and
that alwaies he had bene a friend to them, for that in all
respects &amp; at all times, their doings &amp; manners appeared to
him to be good and worthy of friendship. Finally he sayde,
that as he had in time past bene a friend to them, so would
he now at this present continue his good will, and was rea∣dy
and would be to doe all that in him was to pleasure &amp;
further them, and the effect of their purpose in comming the∣ther.
The Captaine generall gaue him great thankes, and
promised to recompence him very liberally in respect of that
his good will, and for any pleasure or friendship he shoulde
thenceforth shew to him and his company, he shuld be wel
assured to be thankfully considered of. Declaring also that
he was the most ioyfull man of all the world to finde him
there, and to haue him for a friend and an ayde, verely belée∣uing
that God had sent him thether, to giue an ende to the
enterprise of the voyage, which he so desired in discouering
of those <HI>Indias,</HI> and had entered into, and passed through so
many daungers by long tract of time to attaine vnto the
same, and now notwithstanding his arriual ther, he thought
to haue but small fruite of his trauaile, without his helpe &amp;
friendly furtheraunce.</P>
<P>Then he requested him to declare, what manner of
man the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> was, and whether he thought he
would receiue him with good wil as an Embassadour from
the King of <HI>Portingale.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Bontaybo</HI> aunswered, that the King of <HI>Calycut,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
was a very good man and of an honourable disposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Cali∣cuts grea∣test reue∣nue riseth by custōe of Mer∣chandise.</NOTE> and
that he no doubt would receiue him gladly, for Embassa∣dour,
from a straunge king, especially if his comming were
to settle and intreate for establishment of tract or trade of
merchaundise in <HI>Calicut,</HI> and had brought with him anye
kinde of Merchaundise for that purpose: For (said <HI>Bontai∣bo</HI>)
as there doth grow great aduauntage and profit by cu∣stome
thereof to the king, so is the same indéede the verye
principall rents or reuenewes he hath for his maintey∣naunce:
Moreouer he informed the Generall that the king
at that instant was in a certaine village fiue leagues from
<HI>Calicut,</HI> scituated along the coast, named <HI>Panane,</HI> whether
he aduised him to send vnto him, &amp; to declare of his arri∣uall
and comming thether. The Generall very well liking
of the speaches and aduise of <HI>Bontaybo,</HI> did therefore giue
vnto him certeine gifts, and sent with him two of his men
in message to the king of <HI>Calicut,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Certeine messēgers sent by y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine generall to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Calicut</NOTE> requesting <HI>Bontaybo</HI>

did. These messengers being nowe come before the
king, one of them whose name was <HI>Fernan Martyn,</HI> by an
interpretour which he had, declared vnto him, that he came
from his Captaine who is arriued in the port of <HI>Calicut</HI>
with certeine shippes, <Q>and is come thether from the king
of <HI>Portingale,</HI> of purpose to bring him letters, which the
same Captaine is readie to come and present vn∣to
him, if it so stoode with his good liking and pleasure,
whereof to vnderstand he then had sent him, and his fel∣lowe
there present. The king hearing this message, com∣maunded
before he would make aunswere thereto, to giue
to each of them a certeine péece of lynnen cloth made of
Cotten,</Q> and two of silke whith were very good, and euen
such wherewith he was accustomed to girdle himselfe:
And after these péeces were so giuen them, he then deman∣ded
of <HI>Fernan Martyn,</HI> what king that was which hadde
sent him those letters, and how farre from thence his king∣dome
was, wherevnto <HI>Fernan</HI> aunswered and fully infor∣med
him touching that demaund, declaring also that he was
<PB REF="46"/>
a Christian prince, &amp; that all those whom he had sent were
christians, hauing past many troubles and daungers vpon
the sea, before their arriuall there at <HI>Calicut.</HI> The king hea∣ring
all the discourse of their voiage (wherof <HI>Fernan Mar∣tynes</HI>
somwhat at large informed him) did greatly maruell
at the same, &amp; shewed himselfe to be right glad, y<SUP>•</SUP> a Prince
of so great a power as the king of <HI>Portingale</HI> was, &amp; being
also a christian, would send an Ambassadour to him: And
therefore he sent word to the Generall that he and his cō∣panie
were hartelye welcome into his Countrie, requiring
him to bring his ships to an ankor néere, to a village na∣med
<HI>Padarane</HI> (which is somwhat beneath the place where
they first came to an ankor) being a far better harbour then
that of <HI>Calicut,</HI> which is an open roade &amp; very dangerous
for the ships: And appointed that from thence, the General
shuld go by land to <HI>Calicut,</HI> wher he wold be to speak with
him: And therw<SUP>t</SUP> he sent a Pilot, who conuaied the ships to
the port of the same village, howbeit when he had conduc∣ted
them to the bar thereof, the Generall woulde not enter
so far within the same, as y<SUP>•</SUP> Pilot would gladly haue had
him to haue done, fearing indéed that some thing might af∣terward
happen to his preiudice, if he shuld giue ouer farre
credit to those people, &amp; came within the compasse of anye

y<SUP>•</SUP> Captaine General excused himselfe as at y<SUP>•</SUP> present, &amp; also
y<SUP>•</SUP> he would first take counsell of his Captaines, &amp; other the
principall of his Fléet, touching his landing, who being all
ioyned together, said vnto them, y<SUP>•</SUP> he minded to go to sée y<SUP>•</SUP>
king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> &amp; to settle there a trade, and perpetuall
friendship. Against the which his going, his brother repug∣ned,
alleadging y<SUP>•</SUP> it was not conuenient y<SUP>•</SUP> he shuld so doe.
For albeit y<SUP>•</SUP> they were christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moores mortall enimies to christi∣ans▪</NOTE> yet y<SUP>•</SUP> ther were amongst
them many Moores, which were to be feared least thy wold
procure his destruction, since that they were his mortall

ports, would haue killed them all: What should they looke
for, of those of <HI>Calicut,</HI> knowing that they will mixture
themselues with you &amp; yours: quoth he, you séeking to haue
the trade where they haue the same, &amp; so to diminish this
their profit and gaine? He tolde him therefore that it is the
sooner to be beléeued, that they wold procure with all their
force possible to destroy him, yea, although they knew that
the beginning and end of the same did depend vppon his
death, and that therefore there woulde not lacke wayes
to put the same deuice in execution, who being once dead,
for all the griefe the king shoulde take therewith, yet hée
could not raise him againe to lyfe. And that so much the
more they béeing as it were naturall inhabitauntes there,
and he a méere straunger.</P>
<P>Moreouer who doth know what the king doth passe for his

procured.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Princes &amp; Generalls ought to be eareful of their persons in respect of their place and charge.</NOTE> And if so be that they shuld be cast away altoge∣ther,
then were all theyr trauaile lost. To excuse all this,
and that they might remaine vppon this good assuraunce,
it were very good sayd hée, that hée did not goe a shoare,
but that hee did sende one of them, or some other, who
might doe that which he shoulde doe, for those that are
Captaines in especiallye Generalls shoulde not aduenture
themselues in such daungers, but where there were
<PB REF="47"/>
such great necessitie, that they coulde not otherwise excuse
themselues. Of this minde were all the rest of the compa∣nie,
vnto whome the Captaine Generall aunswered, that
although he knew or did vnderstand y<SUP>t</SUP> by his comming it
were present death vnto him, yet he woulde not let but goe
and visit the King of <HI>Calicut,</HI> and the rather to sée whether
he would settle a friendship and trade there, and to haue
out of his Citie, Spices and other commodities, for that
the same (at our arriuall in <HI>Portingale</HI>) might represent as
a witnesse the discouerie of <HI>Calicut.</HI> For if so be that at
the end of so long a time God did returne vs thether with∣out:
then said he, it would be hard to be beléeued that wée
had discouered <HI>Calicut:</HI> And our credit and honour woulde
stand in suspence or ballance, vntill such time there should
come persons of credit from thence, that shoulde declare
that to bée true which we had affirmed. Therefore doe you
not thinke but y<SUP>t</SUP> I had rather die then suffer so long time,
as we haue spent, and are lyke to spend, and others shall
come to discouer y<SUP>e</SUP> truth of our seruice: so that in the meane
while, those that are enuious, should iudge our trauaile as
it shuld please them, certeinly I had rather die then to tar∣rie
vpon the same: Much more friends I doe not aduen∣ture
my selfe to so great a daunger of death as you do sur∣mise,
neither yet that they should remaine in so great dan∣ger,
as you doe presuppose, for I goe to a Countrie where
there are Christians and to talke with a king, which is de∣sirous
that vnto his Citie should come many Merchants,
for the profit that doth arise thereby vnto him: for the
more Merchants that do resort vnto it, the more wil be his
profit. I doe not goe thether to stay there many daies that
the Moores shall haue any such time to vse anye treason a∣gainst
me. And for so much as I doe minde to talke with
the king it shall haue an end, and that within thrée dayes▪
and in this time you may be in a readinesse: And as touch∣ing
the honour and credit that I shall get by making or
establishing this trade, if it please God that he doe accept
the same I will not giue it for any treasure. And the king
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
can settle the same with no other better then with me, for
that he will estéeme me, and beare some reuerence towards
me, being once knowen vnto him that I am the Captaine
generall of this Fléete, and the King of <HI>Portingales</HI> Em∣bassadour,
rather then with any other person whatsoeuer.
Furthermore whosoeuer he be that shall goe in my steede,
the King will thinke himselfe to be mockt, or that I do not
esteeme him, as one that is worthy that I shoulde goe to
speake with him, or els that I doe not trust him on his
word. Besides all this, I cannot giue so large instructions
to him that I should send thether, that he might doe in all
things which is néedfull as much as I my selfe: and if so
be that for my sinnes he shoulde kill me, or take me as a
prisoner, it were a great deale better for me that ther shuld
chaunce to me all this for doing of my duetie, then to re∣maine
alyue, and not to doe the same. And you my friendes
remaining in the Sea and in good ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ge∣nerall de∣termined to goe to Calicut</NOTE> as soone as you shal
heare that any of these things shall chaunce vnto me, get
you hence, and carrie newes of this our discouerie, and as
touching this, let there be no farther talke, for that I by
the grace of God will goe to <HI>Calicut</HI> to sée the King. When
that his determination was perceiued, they all assented that
they were contented with his going: and therevpon they
appointed him twelue of his men to goe with him, that is
to say, <HI>Diego Dias</HI> his Secretarie and <HI>Fernan Martines</HI> the
interpretour, <HI>Iohn de Sala,</HI> which was afterward Treasurer
of the house of the <HI>Indias.</HI> &amp;c. So that with him in all they
were thirtéene. They appointed also that in his absence ther
should remaine for Captaine generall his brother. Also hée
gaue commaundement that he shoulde not suffer any man
to come aboord his ship, and all those that were desirous to
goe aboord to commaund them to remaine in their boate or
<HI>Almadias.</HI> Moreouer he left order with <HI>Nicholas Coello,</HI>
that he should come euery day with his boate as néere vnto

after being Mundaye, the xxviij. of May, the Captaine gene∣rall
did imbark himself with those twelue before rehearsed,
<PB REF="48"/>
they all being apparailed in the best attire that they had, &amp;
their boates furnished with much ordinaunce, flagges, and
trumpets, which went alwaies sounding, vntill such time y<SUP>t</SUP>
y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine general came to land, whereas y<SUP>e</SUP> Catual was tar∣rieng

attended ther continually: besids many others y<SUP>•</SUP> wer not of

are not accustomed to goe a horsebacke, but in these Andors,
which are like vnto a horslitter, sauing y<SUP>t</SUP> they are w<SUP>t</SUP>out any

post w<SUP>t</SUP> thē, at such time as y<SUP>e</SUP> king &amp; noble men do make a∣ny
great iourny, or if so be y<SUP>t</SUP> they wil go a great ground in
a small time: for they may trauell in y<SUP>e</SUP> same either sitting
or lieng, as they wil themselues. Also ther go with these cer∣tain
footmen, which carie with them hats, wherwith to couer
those y<SUP>•</SUP> go in these Andors, which they do call <HI>Bueys,</HI> so that
by this meanes, they are kept from y<SUP>•</SUP> sunne &amp; the raine, ther
are also other Andors, y<SUP>•</SUP> which haue ouer thē a cane bowed
like vnto a hoope, which for y<SUP>•</SUP> they are made very slight, may
easily carie those 2. men. The Captaine generall being moū∣ted
in this Andor, departed w<SUP>t</SUP> the Catuall, who was carried
in another Andor, to a town called <HI>Capocate,</HI> but all y<SUP>e</SUP> rest
of the cōpany went afoote, the people of the country was cō∣maunded
by the Catuall to carie all such apparel as our mē
had brought vp w<SUP>t</SUP> thē, which was ther redeliuered vnto thē,
&amp; being in <HI>Capocate,</HI> they staid to refresh themselues: where
the Captaine generall being in one house &amp; the Catuall in
another they did eate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the fruits of Calicut</NOTE> &amp; to al our men was giuen to eat sod∣den
fish, w<SUP>t</SUP> rice &amp; butter, besides fruits of y<SUP>e</SUP> countrey, which
differ from ours very much, yet they are very good. The one
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
sort of these is called <HI>Lacas,</HI> and the other <HI>Mangas,</HI> howbeit
they haue figs also. The water y<SUP>t</SUP> they did drinke, was very
excellent, as good as any in <HI>Portingal.</HI> Thus after they had
eaten, they went againe to imbark themselues, for that they
shuld go vp a riuer, which from thence runneth into the sea:
the Captaine generall did imbarke himselfe with his com∣pany
into 2. <HI>Almadias,</HI> lieng the one close to the other, which
in y<SUP>•</SUP> countrey they did call <HI>Ensangada.</HI> The Catuall w<SUP>t</SUP> his
traine were imbarked in many others, and the people that
came to the riuers side to sée and view our men were with∣out
number, for so much as that countrey is well inhabited.
And after that they had gone in this riuer about a league,
and that along the shores side, they saw lieng a ground ma∣ny
great ships, the Captaine generall with the Catuall be∣ing
disimbarked, did returne to their Andors, and following
their waye, there resorted alwayes about them thousandes
of people to sée them, wherein they tooke such a felicitie that
the very women also with their children hanging at theyr
backes, did not féele the waye they went in, following to
féed their eyes. From this place which I haue made menti∣on
of, the Catuall did carrie him vnto a certaine <HI>Pagode</HI> of
their Idolls, into which when they were entred, he told him
that the same was a Church of great deuotion, which the
Captaine generall beléeued to be true, &amp; to be some church of
the Christians, &amp; therfore he gaue the more credit therevnto,
the rather for that he saw y<SUP>t</SUP> ouer the principall dore therof,
there hanged seuen little bells, &amp; afore the same there was a
pillour made of wier, the which was as high as the mast of
a ship, vpon the top thereof there stoode a wether cock, made
likewise of wier. This church was as great as a good Mo∣nestary,
and was made all of frée stone, and couered or vau∣ted
ouer with bricke, which gaue an outwarde shewe, as
though within side it shoulde be of verye faire workman∣shippe.
Our Captaine was very glad to sée the same, for
that he thought himselfe to be among Christians, and en∣tering
within this Church with the Catuall, they were
receiued by certaine men, naked from the girdle vpwarde,
<PB REF="49"/>
and from thence downe to the knée, couered with certaine
linnen cloth made of cotten, with y<SUP>•</SUP> which their arme holes
were couered also, without any thing vpon their heads, and
vpon their left sholders they had certaine number of thrids,
which came vnder their right shoulders, much like as the
Priests were wont to weare their stoles héere amongst vs,
when they went to Masse. These men are called <HI>Cafres</HI> and
are Gentiles, which serue in <HI>Malabar</HI> in their <HI>Pagodes,</HI> who
with a sprinkle tooke water out of a certaine fountaine &amp;
threw the same vpon the Captaine generall &amp; vpon the Ca∣tuall
and on the rest of the companye.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy vva∣ter of Ca¦licut</NOTE> After all this
they gaue them Saunders in pouder to cast the same vpon
their heads as they did héere their Ashes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy ash∣es.</NOTE> &amp; as also they shuld
do y<SUP>e</SUP> like vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> brawns of their armes, but they could not
do so, by reason of their apparrel which they had on, but yet
they did not let to doe it on their heads: so going about this
Church, they saw many Images painted vpon y<SUP>•</SUP> wal, wher∣of
some ther wer y<SUP>•</SUP> had great téeth, which appeared to be so
monstrous y<SUP>t</SUP> they were of an inch of length without their
mouth. Others ther wer y<SUP>t</SUP> had foure armes, &amp; therwith wer
so ill fauoured, that they séemed to be very diuells, y<SUP>t</SUP> which
sight made our men stand in doubt, whether the same wer a
Church of Christians or no. Being come afore the Chappel
which stood in y<SUP>e</SUP> midst of their Church, they perceiued y<SUP>t</SUP> the
same had a certain little roofe, made much after y<SUP>e</SUP> manner of
a tower, y<SUP>•</SUP> which was also builded of frée stone, &amp; in a parte
of this roofe ther was a dore made of wire, by y<SUP>•</SUP> which a mā
might enter into it: the going vp to the same tower, was by
a staire of stone: within this tower, which indéed was some∣what
dark, was inclosed in y<SUP>t</SUP> wall a certain Image y<SUP>•</SUP> which
our men beheld a far off, for y<SUP>t</SUP> they would not suffer thē to
go néere y<SUP>•</SUP> same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ge∣nerall de∣cerued, cō¦mitteth Idolatry vvith the Diuell.</NOTE> saieng y<SUP>t</SUP> ther was none y<SUP>•</SUP> could go thether,
but thos y<SUP>•</SUP> wer <HI>Cafres,</HI> howbeit they made a signe to the I∣mage,
naming y<SUP>•</SUP> same our Lady, giuing therby to vnderstād
that it was hir Image. The Captain generall supposing the
same to be true, fell vpon his knées, with y<SUP>•</SUP> rest of y<SUP>•</SUP> cōpany
making their praiers: but one whose name was <HI>Iohn de Sa∣la,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
being in doubt whether y<SUP>e</SUP> same church wer of christians
or not, for y<SUP>•</SUP> he saw so mōstrous Images painted on y<SUP>•</SUP> wals,
as he fel on his knées said, If this be y<SUP>e</SUP> diuel, I worship god.
The Captaine Generall that heard him say so, looking vp∣pon
him laughing. The <HI>Catuall</HI> and his companie as they
came before this Chappell, did fall downe flat vppon the
ground with their hands before them, and this they did

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Rom this place he went forward on his
way, vntill such time he came to <HI>Calicut,</HI>
and at the entering of the same, they carri∣ed
him w<SUP>t</SUP> the rest of his company to ano∣ther
<HI>Pagode,</HI> lyke vnto that which he had
séene before, and when that he would haue
entered into the Citie, the people were so many, as well of
those that came forth of the same for to sée our men, as al∣so
of those that went with him, that for the multitude of
them, he could not goe in the stréets, insomuch that the Ge∣nerall
meruailed to sée so many people: and when as hée
sawe himselfe to be there, he gaue God great thankes, for
bringing him vnto that Citie, most humbly desiring him,
so to guide him, that he might returne to <HI>Portingale,</HI> with
his whole request &amp; desire. After that he had gone awhile
in that stréete, into which he entered, for that the people
wer so many that he could not passe through it, insomuch
that those that did carry him vpon his Andor, were driuen
to go with the <HI>Catuall</HI> into a house. Thether came to beare
the Captaine Generall companie, the <HI>Catualls</HI> brother who
was a noble man, and sent by the kings commaundement
to accompanie him to the kings pallaice, who also brought
with him many <HI>Nayers,</HI> and before them went manye
Trumpets and Sagbuts, vppon the which they went all
<PB REF="50"/>
sounding. And also there was one <HI>Nayre</HI> which carried a
Caléeuer which he shot of, now &amp; then. After y<SUP>t</SUP> the Captaine
generall &amp; this noble man was thus ioyfully receiued, they
tooke their way straight to y<SUP>e</SUP> pallaice, with a great noise, y<SUP>•</SUP>
which those instruments &amp; the people together made, which
after y<SUP>t</SUP> the Catuals brother was come, gaue place &amp; follow∣ed
after them, with as great obedience as if y<SUP>e</SUP> king had ben
there in his owne person. There went along with thē fully
thrée thousand men with their wepons, besids those y<SUP>t</SUP> stood
vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> penthouses, &amp; at their dores, which wer w<SUP>t</SUP>out num∣ber.
The Captaine generall was very glad to sée how well
he was receiued, &amp; said vnto those y<SUP>t</SUP> he caried w<SUP>t</SUP> him, with
a mery coūtenance, how litle do they thinke in <HI>Portingale</HI>
of this our gret receiuing, &amp; with this they came to y<SUP>e</SUP> kings
pallace an houre before y<SUP>e</SUP> Sun set. The kings pallace (lea∣uing

for y<SUP>t</SUP> he neuer goeth frō this pallace til y<SUP>t</SUP> he departeth from
<HI>Calicut.</HI> Out of this pallace there came sūdry <HI>Caimales,</HI> &amp;
other noble men to receiue y<SUP>e</SUP> captain general, which brought
him to a certein gret court y<SUP>t</SUP> was right before y<SUP>e</SUP> gates, &amp; frō
thence they wēt into 4. other seueral yards or courts. At y<SUP>e</SUP>

passed w<SUP>t</SUP> giuing y<SUP>e</SUP> people many &amp; sūdry blows, which y<SUP>e</SUP> por∣ters
bestowed vpō thē to make roome, y<SUP>t</SUP> we might go in: &amp;
being come to y<SUP>e</SUP> last gate which was in y<SUP>e</SUP> house where the
king himself was, ther came forth an old little man, which
was <HI>Bramene Maior</HI> of y<SUP>e</SUP> kings house, who imbraced the
captaine general, &amp; caried him in w<SUP>t</SUP> those y<SUP>t</SUP> wer with him.
<HI>Bramene Maior</HI> is the kings high Priest, &amp; the chiefest of
the religious mē of his gentility. At this entring the people
wonderfully pressed thēselues to go in, for that they see the
king but by great chaunce, as going but few times abroad
out of his pallace, &amp; wold therfore haue entered w<SUP>t</SUP> our mē
to see him. The multitude was so great y<SUP>t</SUP> there wer some of

did accompany the Captaine general, at this third gate en∣tred
into the house wher the king was, the which was ve∣ry

about the wals were of silke of sundry colours. The
king himself was of colour brown, &amp; of a great stature &amp; of
good yeres, he was lieng vpon his <HI>Estrado</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> which was co∣uered
ouer w<SUP>t</SUP> a cloth of white s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lke &amp; gold &amp; a rich estate

had a night cap, made much like vnto a salet, after y<SUP>•</SUP> old sort
which was couered ouer w<SUP>t</SUP> stone &amp; pearle, &amp; in his ears he
ware iewels of y<SUP>•</SUP> same sort. He had vpō him a iacket of fine
cotten, y<SUP>e</SUP> buttons wherof were of great pearle, &amp; the butten
holes were of gold thréed, he had about his middle a white

many bracelets of golde: hard to this <HI>Estrado,</HI> there was a

throweth y<SUP>•</SUP> same out of his mouth, &amp; taketh another. And
for y<SUP>t</SUP> the king shuld not swallow y<SUP>•</SUP> same downe, there is
prepared a vessel of gold for him to spit in, which is as big
or litle bigger thē a dish, hauing a foot also of gold. Also he
hath a fountaine of gold which is ful of water wherw<SUP>t</SUP> hée
washeth his mouth, when he had made an end of chawing
this <HI>Vitele</HI> which he is accustomed to take.</P>
<P><PB REF="51"/>
This <HI>Vitele</HI> is ministred vnto him by an olde man which
standeth hard by the <HI>Estrado,</HI> all the others that are in
this place holde their left hands afore their mouths, to the
end their breath should not come where the king is, who
taketh the same for great discurtesie, to spit or to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niese, &amp;
therefore there is none that breatheth afore the king. The
Captaine General being come into this house, made reue∣rence
to the king, after the vse of the Countrie, which is to
stoope or bowe downe thrée times, lifting vp his hands as
one that praiseth God. The king immediatly made signes
vnto him as willing him to drawe néere vnto him, and
commaunded him to sit downe in one of those seates which
I haue spoken of, who being thus set, the rest of his men
did enter and made him the lyke reuerence, whom the king
commaunded likewise to sit down right ouer against him,
and that there should be giuen them water for their hands,
that they might with the same refresh themselues since
they were very hot, for although it was winter yet it was
hot. After y<SUP>t</SUP> they had washed their hands, he commaunded
to be giuen them Figges and <HI>Iacas</HI> to eate, and that forth∣with,
which they did receiue with a good will. The king
was very glad to sée them eate, who was very earnest in
looking vpon them, and did laugh thereat. Afterward hée
tooke occasion to talke with the old man that ministred vn∣to
him this <HI>Vitele,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cu∣stome in drinking.</NOTE> and in the meane time our men did cal
for water, for that they were a thirst, the which was giuen
them to drinke by an Yewer of golde, and when our men
did vnderstand y<SUP>e</SUP> order of their drinking was to hold their
cup of height ouer their mouths, for y<SUP>•</SUP> the <HI>Malabars</HI> do take
the same for an iniurie to touch y<SUP>e</SUP> cup with their lips, they
did therfore hold the same ouer their mouth, in that order
that part of the water fell into their throates &amp; made some
of them to cough, &amp; vnto others it fell besides their mouths,
and vpon their faces, which did runne downe vppon theyr
breasts. All this the king was very gladde to sée, who loo∣king
towards the Captaine Generall, spake vnto him by
an interpretour, willing him to speak vnto those that were
<PB N="41" REF="51"/>
there, &amp; to tell them his pleasure, &amp; likewise to report vnto
him of theirs, with this the Captaine General was nothing
contented, for y<SUP>t</SUP> he thought the same a disgracing vnto him,
&amp; answered by y<SUP>e</SUP> interpretor y<SUP>t</SUP> he was the king of <HI>Portin∣gales</HI>
Ambassadour, which was a mighty king, &amp; that the
christian princes did not vse to receiue their imbassage by
a third person, but by themselues, &amp; that before very few, &amp;
those y<SUP>t</SUP> were of great credit. And for that he did accustome
the same order in y<SUP>e</SUP> other countries from whence he came,
he wold not therfore vtter his imbassage but only vnto y<SUP>e</SUP>
king himself, vnto which the king answered y<SUP>t</SUP> he liked wel
therof, &amp; that it shuld be so obserued, &amp; immediatly he com∣maunded
the Captaine Generall &amp; <HI>Fernan Martines</HI> to be
carried vnto another chamber which was adorned with y<SUP>e</SUP>
like estate as the other was, &amp; as wel hanged, &amp; after y<SUP>t</SUP> the
Captaine general was ther, y<SUP>•</SUP> king came thether also, but
our men remained where they wer first, &amp; this was about
the Sun set. The king as soone as he was come into this
chamber went to his <HI>Estrado,</HI> there came no more with him
but his interpretor &amp; the <HI>Bramene Mayor,</HI> &amp; the olde man
which doth alwayes giue this <HI>Vitele</HI> vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mes∣sage that vvas sent to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Cali∣cut from y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Portingal</NOTE> &amp; con∣troler

asked of y<SUP>e</SUP> captain general of what part of y<SUP>e</SUP> world he was
&amp; what he wold haue: whervnto he answered, that he was
an Ambassadour of a christian king of y<SUP>e</SUP> Occident part, &amp; of
a kingdome called <HI>Portingale,</HI> besides many others, inso∣much
y<SUP>t</SUP> he is of a great power both in possessions &amp; people,
&amp; much more in riches, &amp; all other things necessarie, more
then any other king of those parts, &amp; hath so ben for y<SUP>e</SUP> space
of these lx. yeres, so y<SUP>•</SUP> those y<SUP>t</SUP> haue ben kings his predeces∣sours,
hauing the fame brought vnto them, how y<SUP>•</SUP> in the <HI>In∣dias</HI>
there, were christian kings &amp; great noble men, in espe∣ciall
y<SUP>e</SUP> king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> they were moued the rather to send
to discouer y<SUP>e</SUP> same by their Captaines, &amp; to make friendship
with the king of y<SUP>•</SUP> country, &amp; to take them for brothers as
reason doth bind the king his Maister now to do, &amp; to vi∣sit
them by his Ambassadors, not y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath any néed of their
<PB REF="52"/>
riches, for that in his owne countries of golde &amp; siluer and
other things of great value, he hath more therof then néede
did require. And as for those Captaines whom he did send
vnto this discouerie, they haue gone in the same a yeare or
two, vntill such time as they haue consumed their victuals
and without finding of that which they sought for, haue
returned to <HI>Portingale,</HI> &amp; haue in vaine spent great sums
of money. But the king <HI>Don Manuel</HI> which reigneth as
now, &amp; is desirous to make an end of this enterprise, which
was begun so long time agone, for that to them ther shuld
not lack sufficient victuals, as there did vnto the others be∣fore,
did therfore giue him thrée shippes that were laden
therwith, commaunding him not to returne to <HI>Portingale</HI>
without the discouery of that king of the christians which
is Lord of <HI>Calicut.</HI> And if so be y<SUP>t</SUP> he shuld returne without
bringing him relation therof, he would then commaund his
head to be cut off. And further he willed him y<SUP>•</SUP> if so be y<SUP>•</SUP> he
should chaunce to arriue at the place where the king was,
to deliuer him two letters, which he wold present vnto him
the next day, for y<SUP>t</SUP> it was then somwhat late. And also that
he should tell him that he was his friend &amp; brother, reque∣sting
him that since that he doth send so far of to séeke him
out, that in recompence thereof he would accept of his kin∣dred,
and friendship, and also that he woulde send him his
Ambassadour for the better confirmation of the same, and
y<SUP>t</SUP> frō thence forth they wold visit one the other with their
embassadours, as it is accustomed amongst christian kings.
The king shewed himselfe to bée well pleased with this
Embassage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Am∣bassadour promised from Ca∣licut.</NOTE> for he tolde the Captaine Generall that hée
was very well welcome. And since that the king of <HI>Por∣tingale</HI>
would be his friend &amp; brother, he would be the like
vnto him, and vpon the same wold send him his Embassa∣dour,
which thing the Captaine Generall did desire most
earnestly, for that he durst not shew himselfe afore y<SUP>e</SUP> king
his Master w<SUP>t</SUP>out him. The king did therfore promise him
so to do, &amp; that forthwith, he wold dispatch him thether. Af∣ter
y<SUP>•</SUP> he was desirous to know y<SUP>e</SUP> whole estate of y<SUP>e</SUP> king of
<PB N="42" REF="52"/>
<HI>Portingale</HI> perticularly, &amp; how far of y<SUP>t</SUP> countrie laye from
<HI>Calicut,</HI> &amp; how long he had ben vpon that voiage. And for y<SUP>t</SUP>
part of the night was well spent, y<SUP>e</SUP> king willed him to re∣tire,
demaunding of him first, whether he would goe lye a∣mongst
the Moores or amongst the Christians, who answe∣red
that he wold lye with neither of them, but alone, &amp; by
himself. The king vpon his answere commanded a certein
Moore which was his factor to go &amp; accompany y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Captaine generall being dispatched to

did now the like, &amp; they all going a∣foot,
ther fell such raine, that y<SUP>e</SUP> stréets ran
full therof, &amp; therefore he was driuen to cōmaund some of
his men to carry him vpon their backs, (not for the water
only) but for y<SUP>•</SUP> it would be late or euer y<SUP>•</SUP> he could come to
his lodging, with this y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine general was so angry, y<SUP>•</SUP>
he complained vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> kings Factor, demaunding whether
he meant to carry him about the citie all y<SUP>e</SUP> night or not,
who answered y<SUP>t</SUP> he could do no otherwise, for y<SUP>t</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> city was
great &amp; scattered, &amp; so he carried him to his owne house, to
rest himselfe a while. And afterward he gaue him a horse,
vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> which he might ride. And for y<SUP>t</SUP> this horse was w<SUP>t</SUP>∣out
a saddle, y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine wold not accept the offer, saieng, y<SUP>e</SUP>
yet rather he wold go a foot, &amp; so he went vntill such time
he came to his lodging, where those y<SUP>•</SUP> did accompany him,
left him in a good lodging. And before his comming, his men
had brought thether his stuffe, where y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine generall
hauing rested himselfe, &amp; being in great ioy to sée so good be∣ginning
of his businesse, determined on the next day being
Tewsdaie, to send a present to the king.
<PB REF="53"/>
And for that he knew he could not send the same, but that
the Factor and the Catuall should haue the ouersight ther∣of,
did therefore sende for them that they might haue the
view thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A present for y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Cali∣cut.</NOTE> who béeing come, he shewed the same vnto
them, which was foure <HI>Capi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis</HI> of graine, and sixe hattes,
foure braunches of Gorall, twelue <HI>Almasares,</HI> a fardell of
Brasse, in the which there were seauen péeces, a Chest of
Sugar, two Barrels of Oile, &amp; two of honnie. The Factor
and the Catuall hauing séene these parcels, began to laugh
therat, saieng, that y<SUP>e</SUP> same was nothing to present the king
withall, for that the poorest Merchant that commeth to his
port doth giue him much more then the same, wishing him
that since he would néeds giue him a present, to sende him
some golde, for that the king woulde not accept any other
thing. At this their answere the Captaine general was of∣fended,
&amp; so he shewed himselfe to be, saieng, that if so be he
were a Merchaunt or that his comming thether were to
trade, he would then haue brought him golde: But he was
no Merchaunt but an Ambassadour, which was the cause
he brought none with him, &amp; that this which he doth now
send to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> is his own goods, &amp; not y<SUP>e</SUP> king his
Maisters, who for that he did not certeinly know that hée
should haue met with the king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> did therfore giue
him nothing to present him withal: but at his next returne
knowing for certeintie that he shall finde him, the king his
Maister will send him golde, siluer, &amp; other rich things. To
this they answered and sayd that it might be so, howbeit it
was accustomed in that countrie, y<SUP>e</SUP> whatsoeuer stranger he
be that doth come &amp; speake with the king, he sendeth hm a
present, which is according to y<SUP>e</SUP> greatnes of his estate. Vn∣to
which the Captaine generall did reply, saieng y<SUP>t</SUP> it was
good y<SUP>t</SUP> their custome shuld be kept, &amp; that for the preseruatiō
of the same, he did make him this present, which is of no
greater value, for the cause aboue said: And therefore he de∣sired
them to suffer him to carrie the same to the king,
which if so be y<SUP>t</SUP> they would not let him doe that, then hée
would send the same backe to his shippes againe.
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
They aunswered him that immediately he might so do, as
he last determined, for that they would not consent that the
same should be carried to the King. With this aunswere
the Captaine generall was very angry, and said vnto them,
that since they would not consent that he should sende that
present to the King, he would therefore go himselfe &amp; speak
with him, and would now returne to his ships. This was
his meaning, to enforme the King what had past about this
present. They said y<SUP>t</SUP> it was well done so to do, but for so
much as they should remaine with him in the Court a good
while, it were for them very necessary to goe about a little
businesse in the meane space, which they will go to doe, and
immediately retourne to goe with him, since that the King
wold not be pleased that he shuld go without them: for so
much as he was a straunger, and for that there were ma∣ny
Moores in the Citie. The Captaine generall giuing cre∣dite
to their words concerning their retourne, immediately
aunswered them that he would tarry for their comming:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treason conspired against the fleete</NOTE>
but they did not returne all that daye, for that they were
enimies to the Captaine generall, by reason of the Moores,
who were his enimies also, and had receiued newes what
he had done in <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> and of the taking of the <HI>Sam∣buco</HI>
in <HI>Mylynde,</HI> and that we were Christians, and that
our comming was to discouer <HI>Calicut. Bontaybo</HI> also told
the Moores, that Spices were estéemed in <HI>Portingale</HI> very
much, and that as he iudged they wer not come to discouer
<HI>Calycut,</HI> but to settle there a trade, and to carrie Spices in∣to
their Countrey, in the which there is of all sorts of Mer∣chaunts
that come to <HI>Calycut</HI> by the way of the straights,
and great store of golde and siluer, and hauing the Trade
setled there, woulde redowne vnto the King great profite
thereby. To the which words the Moores gaue great eare,
and made their reckoning vpon <HI>Bontaybos</HI> speach, and al∣lowed
the same: That we being Christians and once come
to settle a Trade in <HI>Calycut,</HI> their commoditie then would
fall of the price they were at, and so would abate the most
part of their gaine. About this they layed their heads toge∣ther,
<PB REF="54"/>
to worke all meanes they could possible with the king,
to take the Captaine generall prisoner, and to commaunde
his ships to be taken also, and to kill all our men, and this
the rather, for that in no wise they should retourne to <HI>Por∣tingale,</HI>
to carry newes of <HI>Calicut.</HI> And héerevpon they ioy∣ned
those that were in credit with the King, and went vn∣to
him, and one in the name of them all, said vnto the king:
That he shoulde not deceiue himselfe with our men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the Mores oratiō to the king</NOTE> for
that the Captaine Generall was no Embassadour but a
théefe, that went to rob, which they knew for most certaine
by their Factors, which had certified them, that assoone as
we were come to <HI>Monsambicke,</HI> wher the <HI>Xeque</HI> went to
visite the Captaine generall aboord his shippe, and sent him
presents, and established with him friendship, and also gi∣uing
him a Pilot to carrie him to <HI>Calicut,</HI> whether he said
that he would goe. He after this shot his Ordinaunce at the
towne, with the which he killed of his Subiects, and tooke
certaine <HI>Sambucos</HI> laden with Merchaunts, and handeled
both him and his like vnto Enimies. And being departed
from thence to <HI>Mombassa,</HI> likewise vnder y<SUP>e</SUP> color of friend∣ship,
saieng that he was bound towarde <HI>Calicut,</HI> the King
therevpon tooke occasion to send to visite the Captaine ge∣nerall
aboord his ship, requesting him to enter into his har∣bour,
who being determined so to doe, whether that it was
for that he saw within the same many ships, or y<SUP>t</SUP> he thought
he could not make his partie good, did flye away so fast, that
he left one of his Ankors behinde him: and from thence al∣so
the Pilot ran away, which he caried from <HI>Monsambicle,</HI>
for the ill lyfe which he lead with him, with whipping of
him, and putting of him vnto other punishment. And being
departed from <HI>Mombassa,</HI> and come néere vnto <HI>Mylynde,</HI>
did take perforce a <HI>Sambuco</HI> laden with Moores, of y<SUP>e</SUP> which
there were some that dyed in the battaile, &amp; others that are
yet aliue remaining captiues. And for that those that were
captiues willed him to carry them to <HI>Mylynde,</HI> saieng, that
there they woulde giue him a newe Pilot to carrye him to
<HI>Calycut,</HI> by that meanes onely he came thether. And hauing
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
there by the King of <HI>Mylynde</HI> bene receiued very well, yet
the Captaine generall would no more come a lande, fearing
the hurts which he had done, and taking the Moore prisoner
which the King had sent to visit him, and would not dely∣uer
him, vntill such time that he had a Pilot sent him. Wher
by it might well be considered, that if so be that he were an
Embassadour and were come to maintaine peace, he would

maist doe as thou shalt thinke good therein.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king remain∣eth doubt full vvhat to doe.</NOTE> With this
newes the king remained amazed, and told the Moores that
he would determine himselfe what shall be thought most
conuenient: they séeing this, thought the same not to be the
waye to cause the King to doe as they would haue him, and
did afterward tell the Catuall thereof, who was in great
credite with the King, requesting him to perswade with the
King, not to receiue any such Embassage as that was, and
the cause thereof the rather was, that he tooke this present
for so small a valew. With this the Catuall went immedi∣ately
to the King, who told him what the Moores had said,
to whom the Catuall gaue counsaile, to doe as the Moores
had requested him: immediately the King began to change
his countenaunce against the Captaine generall, but not so
much as the same might be perceiued. But as soone as the
Moores had knowledge by the Catuall concerning the pre∣sent
that the Captaine generall would haue sent to y<SUP>e</SUP> King,

it was accustomed that those the which came from other

a Present, and therefore it were good that hée did sende
him one. The Captaine Generall béeing offended with
that iniurye they hadde offered him, and that the Catu∣all

<PB REF="55"/>
did vpon the same take occasion to shew them those péeces,
the which he was minded for to send, who hauing séene the
same, they saide to the Generall, that the Catuall and the
Factor had great reason to be offended thereat, for that the
same was not a present for to be sent to a King, neyther
would they wish him to send it, for that it would be iudg∣ed
that by the sending thereof he did mocke the King: All
this they tolde him, and as they said as friends, in shewing

<HEAD>¶How the Captaine generall returning spake with

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LL this daye the Captaine generall was
greatly offended, for that the Catuall &amp; the
Factor were not returned, so that he was
once determined to goe to the Court with
out them, yet he thought best to tarry till
the next daye, on which in the afternoone
they came, with whome he shewed himselfe to be offended
for their long tarrieng. But they did aunswere him touch∣ing
that matter nothing at all, but talked of other things,
and so went with him to the Court. And for that the King
was somewhat chaunged, as I haue said, against the Cap∣taine
Generall, he did not commaund him to come into his
presence in thrée houres after his comming to the Coursie,
and then commaundement was giuen ther should come no
more in with the Embassadour but two of his owne men,
with the which he was offended, for y<SUP>•</SUP> he thought the same
seperating from his men, was not meant well, did therfore
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
carry with him <HI>Fernan Martines,</HI> and one <HI>Diego Dias,</HI> she
which was his Secretary. Being come where the King
was, he did not receiue him so well as at the first time, but
said vnto him with a seuere countenaunce, that he had tar∣ried
for him all the day before, and he came not. The Cap∣taine
generall aunswered, that he did deferre his comming,
for that he found himselfe weary by reson of the long way,
for he was very loath to tell him the cause why he staid, for
that he woulde not giue the King occasion to talke of the
present that he would haue sent him: But it did well ap∣peare
that the Catuall and the Factor would not haue hin∣dred
the sending of the same vnto the King, but for y<SUP>t</SUP> they
well knew, he would haue made small account thereof. And
also they must of force haue told him that they had seene the
same. Neuerthelesse it coulde not be excused, but that the
King spake vnto the Captaine generall thereof immediate∣ly
saieng:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king quarrel∣leth vvith the Cap∣taine Ge∣nerall.</NOTE> how that he had tolde him that he was belong∣ing
to a great and rich King, and yet he brought no pre∣sent
from him, but an Embassage of friendship onelye, and
therefore he could not tell what friendship he woulde haue
with him, since that he did send him nothing. Vnto this the
Captaine generall did aunswere, that there was no maruel
that he did bring him nothing, for that he came not in as∣suraunce
that he should méete with him. But now since that
he hath séene him he should well perceiue what his King &amp;
Master will héereafter sende him, if so be that God wil giue
him leaue to carry newes of this his discouery. And if so
be that he will giue credite to his Letters which hée did
bring with him, he shall then sée what the King doeth
send him word of. The King in stéede of demaunding his
Letters, asked him whether the King his Master did sende
him to discouer stones or men, and if so be that he did send
him to discouer men, how doth it chaunce then that hée sent
him no present. And since that it is manifest that hée had
brought him nothing, he sayd as then that it was told him
that he had a <HI>Sancta Maria</HI> in golde, requesting of him the
same.</P>
<P><PB REF="56"/>
The Captaine generall was partly ashamed to sée the
King so altered, for that he had not brought him a present.
And now moreouer to demaund without all honestie that
Image. To whom he aunswered, that the <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI>
which they tolde him of, was made of woode, and gylded ouer
and not of Massie golde. And although that it were (yet
would he not depart therewith) forsomuch as the same had
preserued him in the Sea, and had brought the same from
his Countrey. The King did not reply vpon this answere,
but demaunded those Letters the which the King had sent
him: whereof the one was in the <HI>Portingale</HI> tongue, the
other in the <HI>Arabian</HI> language. These he tolde him were
sent in this order, for that the King his Master did not know
whether of these two languages was vnderstoode in his
Countrey. Wherefore he desired that since the <HI>Portingale</HI>
language was not vnderstood in his Countrey but the <HI>Ara∣bian,</HI>
and that there were Christians of the <HI>Indias</HI> that did
vnderstand the same, one of those might read his Letter, and
the rather for that the Moores are enimies to the Christi∣ans,
of whom he was afeard, least that they should chaunge
the sense thereof. The King commaunded them so to bée
read: howbeit there could be founde no <HI>Indian</HI> that coulde
read the same, or at the least would shew himselfe that hée
could read them. The Captaine generall séeing that there
was no other remedy, but y<SUP>•</SUP> the Moores must néeds read the
same, was driuen then to request the King, that <HI>Bontaybo</HI>
might be one of them. This was done, for y<SUP>t</SUP> as he thought
he would speake and vse more truth then the others, for the
acquaintaunce they had with him. The King commaunded
the same to be read by other thrée, who hauing read y<SUP>e</SUP> same
first of all to themselues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effect of y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Portin∣gales Let∣ters to the king of Calycut</NOTE> &amp; afterward with a loude voyce de∣clared
to the King the effect thereof, the which was, That

one of the mightiest Princes of all the <HI>Indias,</HI> &amp; a Christi∣an,

which he hath in great plentie, for which there commeth di∣uers

from many places of the world thether to buy y<SUP>e</SUP> same.
And therefore if so be he will giue him license to sende for
the same, that then he wil send vnto him from his kingdome
many things which he hath not in his, as his Captaine ge∣nerall
and Embassadour will tell him. And if so bée that
with those things he were not pleased, he will sende him
money both of golde and siluer to buy them withall, &amp; how
that as well of his Merchaundize as of the money, y<SUP>t</SUP> Cap∣taine
generall could shew him part. The King hearing this,
as he was desirous that for the increase of his rents there
should come many Merchaunts vnto <HI>Calycut,</HI> shewed him∣self
to be wel pleased with this letter, &amp; also made vnto the
Captaine generall a better countenaunce then he did before,
&amp; asked him what Merchaundize ther were in <HI>Portingale.</HI> He
named many, shewing how that of all he had brought with
him part, and also of their money, requesting him license
to goe aboord for the same, and in the meane while he wold
leaue in his lodging foure or fiue of his men. The King gi∣uing
more credite to that which he spake, then to that the
Moores had told him, said vnto him, y<SUP>t</SUP> he might go in a good
houre, &amp; carie his men with him, for there was no necessitie
that they should remaine a lande, &amp; that he should bring his
Merchandize, &amp; sell them as well as he could. With this ly∣cense
he remained well content, for (as he saw y<SUP>e</SUP> King make
him at the first an ill countenance) so he thought y<SUP>t</SUP> he wold
not haue giuen him y<SUP>e</SUP> same, &amp; with this license he went first

<P>THe next daye after, which was the last daye of

And for that the Horse came after that order, he woulde

not accept his offer, but rather requested him for one of his

he went to <HI>Pandarane,</HI> and all his men came after him on
foote. There went to beare him company many <HI>Nayres,</HI> the
Catuall did remaine in <HI>Calicut,</HI> and when the Moores had
notice that he should there staye, and that the Captaine ge∣nerall
was gone towards his ships, supposing that he went
for altogether, were sore amazed therewith, wherevpon the
Moores tooke occasion to goe to the Catuall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the Mores make a nevv con∣spiracie.</NOTE> with large of∣fers
of money to pursue the Captaine generall, and vnder a
fained pretence to lay hands vpon him and to take him pri∣soner,
for that they would finde occasion to kill him: and he
by this meanes shoulde remaine in no fault thereof at all.
And albeit that the King would punish him forsomuch as he
did kéepe him prisoner, yet they would not feare but to get
him his pardon. With this bribe and promise he did depart
immediately, and went in such hast after him, that hée past
by our men which did remaine behinde the Captaine gene∣rall,
for that they were not able to goe much, by reason of
the heate. The Catuall hauing ouertaken the Captaine ge∣nerall,
asked him why he did make so much hast, or wher he
wer now running away: this was spoken by signes, y<SUP>•</SUP> which
the Captaine generall did vnderstand, who aunswered him
also by signes that he did runne away to flye the heat. And
being come to <HI>Pandarane,</HI> for that his men as yet did not
appeare, the Captaine generall tolde the Catuall that hée
would not goe into the village, vntill his men were come,
and there he tarried for them in a house, wherein he rested
himselfe from the raine: howbeit they came not vntill it
was almost Sunne set, for so long he did tarry for them be∣cause
they had lost their waye. But after that they were
come, the Captine generall tolde them, that then it was
not time to leaue him, whereas if so be that they hadde
come sooner, hée hadde bene as then in his Shippe.</P>
<P>Wherevppon, immediatelye hée did demaunde of the
Catuall a Boate or Pinnace for to goe aboorde in, who
for that hée pretended an other thing, aunswered
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
him, that it was verye late, and that the shippes did ride
farre, and going in the night he might misse them, and ther∣fore
that it were a great deale better to tarie vntill y<SUP>e</SUP> next
day. To y<SUP>e</SUP> which the Captaine generall made him a plaine
answere, that if so be that he would not giue him an <HI>Al∣madias</HI>
or Pinnace, he woulde immediatly returne to the
king &amp; complain vpon him, forsomuch as the king had sent
him to his ships, and he would séeme to stay him, which
was very ill done, since that he was a Christian as they
were. This was spoken with such a coulour as if he wold
haue returned to <HI>Calicut.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissimu∣lation in y<SUP>e</SUP> Catuall</NOTE> The Catuall for to dissemble
with him the more, did make him a countenance as though
he would giue him thirtie <HI>Almadias,</HI> if he woulde haue
so many. Howbeit he tolde him that he did counsell him
for the best, and to remaine. But if so be that he would goe
he was contented therewith. Thus on one parte he sent
to séeke out <HI>Almadias</HI> or Pinnaces, and on the other part
commaunded the owners of the same to hide themselues
out of the way because they shuld not deliuer the same. In
the meane season while they went to séeke those Pinna∣ces,
the Captaine Generall went along the water side, and
for that he had an euill suspition of their dealing, for that
which they had done to him in <HI>Calicut,</HI> he commaunded
<HI>Gonsallo Peres,</HI> a Marriner, with other two of his men, to
go before as fast as they could, &amp; sée if they could finde <HI>Ni∣cholas
Coello</HI> w<SUP>t</SUP> his boats to wil him to kéepe himself out
of the way, forsomuch as he was afeard least y<SUP>t</SUP> the Catual
wold send to take his boats, with all those that were with
him in the same, <HI>Gonsallo Peres</HI> with the other went about
that businesse whilest the Catuall went in the meane sea∣son
so leaserly to prouide for this boat, that the night drew
on, so that it was thrée houres within night ere he coulde
heare of any thing what hée had done, and what for that &amp;
also to tarrye the comming of those that went to <HI>Ni∣cholas
Coello,</HI> the Captaine Generall was the willinger
to stay there that night. After that the Catuall had placed
the Generall in a Moores house, tolde him that he woulde
<PB REF="58"/>
goe to séeke out <HI>Gonsallo Peres,</HI> &amp; the other two that went
with him. Howbeit he came not backe till it was the mor∣ning.
And as soone as the Captaine Generall had fight of
him, immediatly he required a boate for to goe in vnto
his shippes. But as soone as the Catuall heard him, he then
spake vnto his <HI>Nayres</HI> that were there present in his lan∣guage,
who afterward willed the Captaine Generall to cō∣maunde
his ships to be brought néere vnto the shoare, and
that being done he shoulde haue license to goe his waye,
with this the Captaine Generall was somewhat afearde,
howbeit he aunswered him with a stout stomacke, that as
long as he was on land, he would commaund no such mat∣ter
to be done, forsomuch as then his brother woulde iudge
him to remaine in prison, and that he did commaunde the
same to be done more for feare then any thing els, whervp∣on
he wold immediatly depart toward <HI>Portingal,</HI> without
him.</P>
<P>To this the Catuall made answere with the others that
were with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Catu¦als pur∣pose ope∣ned.</NOTE> speaking with a stoutnesse, that if so be that
he would not doe that which was willed him to doe, y<SUP>•</SUP> then
they will not let him go a boord. To the which shewing
himselfe to be therewith offended, he made answere that if
so be that they would not let him go, that then he wold re∣turne
to the king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> and make his complaint, who
if then he would stey him in his countris, y<SUP>•</SUP> then he would
be verie glad to dwel in the same. The Catuall therevpon
willed him so to do, &amp; to goe to the king to make his com∣plaint,
but yet for all his saieng he would not consent ther∣vnto,
for that he had commaunded the doores of his lodging
to be kept shut, placing within the same sundry <HI>Nayres</HI> with
their weapons. And if so that any of our men should goe
forth, there were appointed many of the enmyes to with∣stand
them. Neuerthelesse it was Gods pleasure that the
Catuall durst not venture to kill the Captaine Generall,
nor yet any of his men for all that the Moores hadde bri∣bed
him with a great summe of money, and for all that hée
was in great credit with the king, for hée stoode in such a
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
feare thereof, that he durst not doe it.</P>
<P>Tho cause why he required the shippes to be brought to
the shoare side was, for that they being there, the Moores
might the better laye the same a boorde, and so take them
and kill all those that were within them, which thing for
that it did so manifestly appeare to the Captaine General,
he would not commaund the Shippes to bée brought anye
néerer. And also for that the same was so appareaunt
vnto the others of his men that were with him. They
gaue him counsaile not to deale therein. The Catu∣all
séeing that he would not commaunde those Shippes to
bée brought néere the shoare, and for that there was no
cause to staye him or offer him any wrong, and séeing that
hée could not kill him, did then beginne to request him to
bring his Sailes and the Rudder of the Shippes a lande.
With that the Captaine Generall beganne to laugh, say∣eng,
that he would neither doe the one, nor yet the other,
since that the king did giue him frée license to goe without
any condition.</P>
<P>And therefore hée willed him to doe what he would, and
how that of all the iniuryes which hée had offered him, the
king shoulde bée made priuie, who he knewe woulde doe
him iustice, but yet for all this, both hée and his remay∣ned
in some feare of suspect, although they did not outwardly
shew the same.</P>
<P>At length the Captaine Generall with the rest feigning
themselues to be an hungred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gene¦rals vnef∣fectuall excuse.</NOTE> and that they were vnpro∣uided
of victualls, did request him that some of his men
might goe to prouide the same, and hée woulde remaine a∣lone,
but for all that the Catuall woulde not agrée there∣vnto.
Nowe our men béeing in feare to sée themselues
in such a daunger. Then came <HI>Gonsallo Peres,</HI> suppo∣sing
that the Captaine Generall had ben at his liberty, and
that they were tarrieng for him and the others, who tolde
him that hée hadde mette with <HI>Nicholas Coello,</HI> and with
the others which tarryed for him with theyr Boates a
lande.</P>
<P><PB REF="59"/>
This newes being brought to the Captaine Generall, hée
was afeard least the Catuall should know thereof, which
if he had knowne indéed he would haue sent Pinnaces and
many men in them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gonsallo Peres sent back to the ships</NOTE> for to haue taken them. Therefore did
he procure by all the meanes he could, that <HI>Gonsallo Peres</HI>
shoulde secretlye returne, from thence vnto their shippes,
and put themselues in good order. And also that he should
goe with them and informe them in what case he doth re∣maine.
<HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> hauing receiued this dispatch,
did forthwith depart, and that in hast, and immediatly af∣ter
he was departed, the Catuall was aduertised thereof,
who sent after him sundrie Pinnaces well appointed, but
yet they could not ouertake him, and therefore they retur∣ned
againe vnto the Catuall. Then the Catuall after that
they were come did once more request the Captaine Gene∣rall
to write vnto his brother to bring the shippes néere
to the lande, but he could not perswade the Captaine Ge∣nerall
so to doe, saieng that if he should doe it, yet his bro∣ther
would not consent therevnto, and although he would,
yet he knew that the companye would not. To this the
Catuall did replye, that he shoulde not make him beléeue
that, forsomuch as he did well know that all things should
be done as he would commaund. Howbeit the Captaine
Generall wold write no such letter; for that he was afeard
of the bringing of the ships so néere the shoare, for the causes

constancie of the Captaine Generall, that he woulde not

The next day which was Saterday the second of Iune, hée

him at lyberty, that then hée did hope in GOD that hée
woulde strengthen those fewe that remained in the Fléet,
with whome and with the Ordinance that they haue, hée
woulde come and set him at lyberty, and of this hée might
make full accompt, and of no other thing.</P>
<P>The Merchaundise béeing landed, the Captaine Gene∣ral
did deliuer the same vnto the Catual, and also to <HI>Die∣go
Dyas</HI> whome he lefte for▪ Factour of the same, and to
<HI>Aluora de Braga</HI> the Scriuenor, who remained in a house
which the Catuall had sought out for them. In this space
the Captaine Generall made himselfe in a readynesse to
goe aboorde his shippes, but first the Catuall did reforme,
and make himselfe friendes with him.</P>
<P>After that hée was a boorde, hée would send no more
Merchaundise a lande, vntill such time hée heard newes
the same were solde, neyther yet would goe anye more a
lande, because hée would runne in no such daunger, with
this the Moores were grieuously offended, for that they
thought that if so be that he would come a land, that there
they might doe him more hurte then a Seaboorde.</P>
<P>And for that they woulde the rather so do, they beganne to
make a mocke at the merchandise which he had left a land.
Also they wrought all the means they could to hinder their
sales therof, saieng y<SUP>t</SUP> they wer litle or nothing worth. Of al
this y<SUP>e</SUP> Captain general was informed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">deuises of the Mores to entise thē aland.</NOTE> &amp; for y<SUP>•</SUP> as he thought
the king knew nothing of all these things, neither yet what
discurtesie the Catuall had offered him, &amp; for that he should
vnderstand the cause why the Captaine Generall did not
returne a land, neither yet wold send any more merchan∣dise,
he did therfore send him word within fiue dayes after
hy his Factour of all that they hadde done vnto him,
and also what iniurye the Moores hadde shewed him,
<PB REF="61"/>
touching their Merchants, promising notwithstanding, that
he would not let to be at his commaundement with all the
whole Fléet. Then the king seemed to be very greatly offen∣ded
for that which they had done to y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine general, in∣somuch
as he had sent him vnto his shippes. But for all
that the Catuall went vnpunished, although he sent the
Captaine Generall worde, that he would punish those that
had so vsed him, which out of doubt were naughtie christi∣ans,
so that it did well appeare that it grieued him verye
much to heare thereof. And as touching the Merchaundise
he promised to sende thether such as shoulde buye the
same, as hée did indéede seauen or eyght Merchauntes, which
are Gentiles <HI>Gusarates,</HI> and with his Factour hée sent a
<HI>Nayre,</HI> which was a principall honest man, to the intent
hée might remaine in the Factorye with the Factour, to
whome hée gaue commaundement diligentlye to beware
that there shoulde not come any Moores to kill him.</P>
<P>But for because that this was done but vnder couloure
that the Moores shoulde not séeme to subborne the Mer∣chauntes,
they bought nothing, but rather did abate the
price, of the which the Moores were verye gladde, and said,
that nowe it did well appeare that they were not alone
that woulde not buye of theyr Merchaundise, yet for all that
ther durst come no Moore to the Factorie, they once hauing
notice that there was placed a <HI>Nayre</HI> by the kinges com∣maundement.
And if so be that before they did not abide or
loue vs, they ten times worse loued vs afterwarde, so that
whensoeuer any of our men should come a land, they recei∣ued
the same as an iniurie done vnto them, spitting on the
ground, saieng: <HI>Portingale, Portingale.</HI> But our men which
vnderstoode their meaning did laugh thereat, to the ende
thereby they might sée howe little they did estéeme their
doinges, for so the Captaine Generall commaunded them
to doe. Nowe perceiuing that there was none that would
buy of the Merchants, he supposed the cause to be for that
they lay in a place where there were no Merchaunts.</P>
<P>And therfore supposing that if so be that they were in <HI>Cali∣cut,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
where other Merchants are, he should sell the better, did
therfore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue y<SUP>e</SUP> King of <HI>Calicut</HI> by a messenger for license
to send the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mer¦chandize paide for by y<SUP>e</SUP> king him selfe</NOTE> which he gaue immediately, and comman∣ded
the Catuall to sée the same brought forthwith, &amp; to such
as should carrie them, to sée them paid at his owne costes
and charges, for that he would not that any thing of y<SUP>e</SUP> king
of <HI>Portingales,</HI> shuld be at any charges in his Country, and
so it was done: but for all this the Captaine generall wold
neuer come more a lande, for that which the Catuall hadde
done vnto him, and for that <HI>Bontaybo</HI> which came to sée
him manye times, did giue him counsaile so to doe, for that
the King was moueable, and therefore it was possible that
the Moores would alter his minde, for the great credite that
they were of with him. But the Captaine general was ve∣ry
warie, and because that he was a Moore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bontaybo vsed, but not trust∣ed.</NOTE> he would not
much trust him, neither yet woulde giue him account what
he was minded to doe: yet for that he would séeme to haue
him in some reputation that he should bring him alwayes
newes of that which did passe on shoare, he departed with
him both money and other rewards.</P>

<HI>Calycut,</HI> &amp; to buye ther what they thought
good, so that there went out of each shippe
euery day a man, and those being returned,
there went immediately others. And as they went on this
<PB REF="62"/>
order, they were carried to the Gentiles houses wher they
had good chéere, and also when occasion serued might haue
among them good lodging. The like courtesie they did re∣ceiue
in <HI>Calicut,</HI> besides they did report vnto our men of all
such things as they had, and after the selfe same manner,
our men did bestow amongst them part of that they caried,
which were bracelets of Brasse &amp; of Copper, Pewter, and
apparell, which they carried to sell in <HI>Calicut,</HI> or anye other
place, where they might goe as quiet as in <HI>Lishborne.</HI>
From the lande there went aboord both Fisher men &amp; Gen∣tiles

that went thether with their children, who carried nothing
with them to sell, but only their going was to sée our ships.
The Captaine generall was very glad of their comming, &amp;
commanded to giue them meate: this he did for to increase
the friendship betwéene the King of <HI>Calicut</HI> &amp; them. After
this order, the ships wer neuer without some, &amp; those y<SUP>t</SUP> wer

without receiuing either hurt of the <HI>Moores</HI> or of the

the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> would haue peace and friendship with
the King his Master, was the occasion that almost in thrée
moneths that our men had trade in <HI>Calycut</HI> they did receiue
no manner hurt, either of the Moores or of the <HI>Nayres.</HI> Hée
did therfore determine to establish the Factorie which was
there, with all such Merchandize as he had lefte at that pre∣sent
(although the least parte thereof was solde) for that
there was now layde a good foundation or ground worke,

to sende againe, and if it might please God to giue him
life, that he might bring him newes of this Discouerie, so
that it should not be néedfull to make any new consent or a∣gréement
for the Factorie. And by the counsaile of his Cap∣taines
and of the other Principalls of his ships, he sent vn∣to
the King of <HI>Calicut</HI> a present, of skarfes of sundry cou∣lours,
of silkes, Coralls and other things, which was caried
vnto him by <HI>Diego Dias,</HI> desiring the King to pardon him,
for that he was so bold as to send him that present, conside∣dering
he did the same for no other purpose, but onelye to
shew what seruitour he was of his, who is and will bée al∣wayes
at his commandement, which was the occasion that
he sent it, and not for that he thought that things of so smal
valew, were of sufficient dignitie, for to represent a King
withall of so great a power as he was. And if so be that he
had in his custodie, that which he might estéeme or think to
be of a more worthie price, he would sende it with a better
good will. And for that the time now drew néere y<SUP>e</SUP> he deter∣mined
to depart, he ordained for the same, and also if so bée
that he did minde to send any Embassadour to the King his
Master to confirme the amitie or friendship betwéen them,
he desired him to commaund him to be in a readinesse, for
that he had a confidence that as touching that which he had
agréed vpon with his highnesse, as also presuming on y<SUP>e</SUP> gifts
which he had receiued at his hands, y<SUP>t</SUP> he might as he was
desirous, leaue in <HI>Calicut</HI> that Factor with his Scriuenor &amp;
the Merchandize which he had left, not onely for a witnes of
a perpetuall peace &amp; friendship setled ther with his highnes,
but also for a testimony of the truth of his Embassage, &amp; of
that which y<SUP>e</SUP> King his Master shuld send héerafter, as soone
as he had news of him, &amp; also for confirmatiō of his discoue∣ry
&amp; to get some credit in <HI>Portingale,</HI> he did therfore send to

one <HI>Bahar</HI> of cinamon, &amp; another of cloues, &amp; another of some

<PB REF="63"/>
had receiued his message, there past foure dayes afore the
King would consent that he should come in his presence, al∣though
that he went euery day vnto his Pallaice. After that
he had commanded him to come into his presence, he view∣ed
how and after what sort he came laden, and therevpon
asked him with a frowning countenaunce, what it was that
he would haue: but <HI>Diego Dias</HI> at that time was afearde,
that he would commaund him to be killed. But after that
he had told him his message and would haue deliuered him
the present, he would not sée it, but commaunded it to be de∣liuered
to his Factor. The aunswere that he gaue touching
the Captaine generall was, that since he would néedes goe
his waye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kings aunsvvere vnto Die∣go Dias.</NOTE> he might so doe: but first or that he doe depart, he
must giue him 600. <HI>Serasynes,</HI> for so it was the custome of
the Countrey. <HI>Diego Dias</HI> being returned with this present,
was accompanied by manye <HI>Nayres,</HI> which he séeing,
thought it to be for the best: but as soone as he was come
to the Factorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diego Di∣as kept in prison,</NOTE> they remained at the dore, and woulde not
consent, that he or any other shoulde come forth. And after
this proclamation was made in all the Citie, that vpon pain
of death there should goe aboord our Fléete no boate or <HI>Al∣madias:</HI>
but yet notwithstanding all this <HI>Bontaybo</HI> went,
and gaue warning to the Captaine generall in secrete, not to
goe a lande, nor consent that any of his should goe: for that
he knew for most certaine by the Moores, that if so be that
he or they shoulde so doe, the King would commaunde theyr
heads to be stroken off. And as touching all his faire words
and good entertainment, which he had shewed him vnto that
present, as also to giue him a house in the which his Mer∣chandize
might be layd, as also the good entertainment that
our men had, was but méere dissimulation, and to the ende,
he might haue taken him a lande with them, &amp; so haue com∣maunded
them all to be killed, which was wrought by the
industrie of the Moores onely, which had made the King be∣léeue,
that they were théeues and went a rouing, and that
he came not vnto his Harbour, but to steale such Merchan∣dize
as should be brought to the Citie, and also to espie the
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
Countrey, and after to come with a great Fléete for to in∣uade
the same. In the selfe same order was the Captaine
generall informed by two <HI>Malabars,</HI> which are Gentiles, be∣ing
therefore now in a studie what was best to be done, ha∣uing
this aduertisement for most certaine, as soone as it was
night, there came aboorde the Generalls ship, a slaue of the
colour blacke, which was naturally borne in <HI>Guynee,</HI> &amp; be∣longed
vnto <HI>Diego Dias</HI> and also was a Christian, and had
the Portingall tongue very well, who tolde him that <HI>Die∣go
Dias</HI> and <HI>Aluoro de Braga</HI> did remain in prison, &amp; what
aunswere the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> had made to his message, &amp;
what he had commaunded to be done with his present, and
also what Proclamations there were made: <HI>Diego Dias,</HI>
for that he thought good to giue him knowledge of y<SUP>t</SUP> which
had past, had bribed a Fisher man to carrie this messenger,
and that in the night season that he might not be knowen.
After that the Captaine generall had heard all this, he was
much offended therewith: howbeit, for that hée woulde sée
the end thereof, would not depart, but did let passe that day,
to sée whether that any would come aboord him. The nexte
day which was Wednesdaye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boies sent for spyes</NOTE> being the xv. of August, there
came one onlyPinnace or <HI>Almadia</HI> aboord the General, in
the which were foure boyes, which brought fine precious
stones to sell, and for that they came after such sort he tooke
them to be spies, and that their comming was for no other
purpose but to sée what they did: and by this meanes hée
thought he might vnderstand in what reputation they were
with the King. This was the occasion the Captaine
generall did receiue them with as good a countenaunce as
he did before, giuing them nothing to vnderstand y<SUP>t</SUP> he knew
of the imprisonment of <HI>Diego Dias,</HI> and wold not therefore
laye hand vpon those, but vpon such as shoulde come after∣ward
(which as he thought should be of more credite) vntill
such time as he had recouered those that were imprisoned.</P>
<P>Vnto those also he wrote a Letter by those Boyes,
with fained words, saieng that he did vnderstande of theyr
imprisonment: this was done in such order, that if so be this
<PB REF="64"/>
letter should haue come to any other mens hands, they could
not haue vnderstood the same. These Boyes did deliuer vn∣to
him this letter, who afterward told the king what great
entertainment they had at the Captaine generalls hands,
which made him to beléeue that he knewe nothing of the
imprisonment of his men, whereof he was very glad &amp; did
retourne and send aboord others, and those that shoulde goe
had warning giuen them not to disclose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Calicuts treson to¦wards the Captaine generall.</NOTE> that the Factour
with the others did remaine prisoners. This was done by
pollicie, for that he made this reckoning to deceiue the Cap∣taine
generall on this sort, vntill such time that he was a∣ble
to sende a Fléete of ships vpon him, or til that the ships
of <HI>Meca,</HI> should come and take him. On this sort went the
<HI>Malabars</HI> aboord, vnto whom the Captaine generall made
a good countenaunce, and commaunded them to be enter∣tained
very well: all this he did for y<SUP>t</SUP> he saw none worth
the staieng. On the Sunday next, there came sixe principal
<HI>Malabars,</HI> with other fiftéene which waited vpon them, in
another Pinace. And for that the Captain generall thought
that for those the King would send him his Factor and his
Scriuenour, he laid hands vpon them all, onely he lefte two
Mariners in a pinace, by whom he sent a letter to the kings
Factors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certaine Malabars stayed in exchange</NOTE> written in the <HI>Malabars</HI> tongue, in the which he de∣maunded
for the Factor and his Scriuenor, &amp; then he wold
send those which he had staid. The kings factor hauing peru∣sed
this letter, he enformed y<SUP>e</SUP> king of y<SUP>•</SUP> which had past, who
cōmaunded, the Factor &amp; Scriuenor to be brought home to
his house as prisoners, that he might from thence send for
them, and to dissemble therewith as though he knewe no∣thing
of their imprisonment, &amp; so cause them to be sent from
thence to the Captaine generall, for that he might send him
those <HI>Malabars</HI> which he had detained, whose wiues made
exclamation for the imprisonment of their husbands. And
therefore the King was the more willinger to set our men
at libertie, who afterward remained a while in the Kings
Factors house.</P>

haue out of thy Countrie, is Siluer, Gold, Corall, &amp; Skar∣let.
The Captaine Generall for that he sawe the king to

therewith sent him all such as he hadde stayed that were
<HI>Nayres,</HI> and for all the others, he sent him word, he would

there came a boord <HI>Bontaybo</HI> who tolde the Captaine Ge∣nerall
that he came so sodeinly away from <HI>Calicut</HI> for that
the Catuall by the kings commaundement had taken from
him all that he euer had, saieng that he was a christian, and
that his comming to <HI>Calicut</HI> ouer land was by the king of
<HI>Portingales</HI> commaundement onely to bée his spie. Other
matters there were which he told him of, and that the same
came by the Moores procurement, the which he knew wel,
that as they tooke his goods, so they meant to do him some
shrewd turne in his person, if so bée that they coulde haue

should say, there came part of theyr Merchaundise. And af∣ter
these there came other foure one after another. And as
touching those thrée that brought those Skarfes, they tolde
the Captaine Generall that there came all theyr Merchan∣dise
<PB REF="66"/>
which they would put in his boate, and therefore they
willed him to bring thether those <HI>Malabars</HI> which he had

did will them to goe their waye, for that hée woulde haue

<P>And if so be that God of his diuine goodnesse doe giue

<SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lthough that the Captaine Generall re∣ioysed
very much for that hée had discoue∣red
<HI>Calicut,</HI> yet he was not fully satisfied
therwith altogether, for that the king had
conceiued against him great displeasure, &amp;
by this meanes as he iudged the next fléet
that the king his maister, should send, would run in great
daunger. Howbeit perceiuing that it lay not in his power to
do any more, he was therfore contented onely with the dis∣couery,
and to haue knowne the <HI>Indias,</HI> &amp; of their nauigati∣on,
&amp; what was commodious for the Countrie, and to haue
brought with him from thence examples of the spices, drugs,
and precious stones, as also of all other thinges that were
within the same citie. And hauing there no more to doe, he
departed, carrieng with him those <HI>Malabars</HI> which he had
taken, for that by them he hoped to haue some agréement
made with the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> at the returne of anye other
Fléet. The Thursday after his departure, being in ralme a
league of from <HI>Calicut,</HI> there came towarde him to y<SUP>e</SUP> num∣ber
of lx. <HI>Tonys</HI> full of Souldiers, by the which the king of
<HI>Calicut</HI> thought to haue taken them, who séeing them com∣ming
commaunded his ordinaunce to be shot of at them, &amp;
that oftentimes, and if he had not done so, they would haue
put him in greate daunger for that they followed him
an houre and a halfe. And by reason of a showre of
raine which came vpon a sodeine, the Captaine Generall
was driuen a sea boord with all his Fléete, &amp; in the meane
while the enimies fledde their waye, and bearing his
course towards <HI>Mylinde</HI> in great calmes, &amp; that along the
coast, thought good &amp; conuenient although y<SUP>e</SUP> king of <HI>Calicut</HI>
had abused him sundry waies, that for the necessitie y<SUP>•</SUP> those
that should returne to <HI>Calicut,</HI> should haue of his friendship
and fauour to receiue from thence theyr lading of Spices,
to vse as it were some friendship with them, since that the
king would be gladde thereof, in especiall being exalted,
did therefore write vnto him a letter in the <HI>Arabian</HI>
<PB REF="67"/>
tongue, which was penned in that language by <HI>Bontaybo,</HI>
in the which he did craue pardon for the carrieng awaye of
those <HI>Malabars</HI> with him, which was done for no other in∣tent
then that they shoulde be as witnesses of that the
which he had discouered, as before hée had sent him worde.
And for that he lefte no Factorie in <HI>Calycut</HI> (the which he
was sorrie for) was for feare least that the Moores shoulde
kill him, which was also the occasion that he was not of∣ten
times a land. Yet for all that he did not leaue, but
woulde bée alwayes at his commaundement, since that
the king, his Maister would be gladde of his friendshippe,
and also foorthwith woulde sende him in his Fléete
greate abundaunce of all such merchaundise as he doth de∣maund
for, by the trade, that from hence forth hée shoulde
haue with the <HI>Portingales</HI> in his Citie, would redound vn∣to
him great profit. This letter was deliuered vnto one of
the <HI>Malabars</HI> to carry the same a land to the place where it
was cōmāded to be deliuered. And afterward he knew y<SUP>t</SUP> the
same was deliuered to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of <HI>Calicut.</HI> Then y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine
general going forward in his course, &amp; that along the coast,
on the next Thursday after, he fell amongst certeine rocks,
with all his Fléete, and from one of them that was inha∣bited
there came forth sundry Pinnaces with men, within
the same to sell them Fish, and other victualls. The Cap∣taine
Generall did receiue them very curteously, who com∣maunded
to giue them both shirts and other things, of the
which they were verye gladde, wherevpon he tooke occasion
to aske them whether they woulde be content that there
shoulde be erected a marke with a crosse in the same, with
the royall armes of <HI>Portingale,</HI> in token that the <HI>Portingals</HI>
are theyr friends. And they aunswered that they were con∣tented,
and thereby they well knew that we were christi∣ans,
and so was the marke placed, and since that time it is
called <HI>El Padron de Sancta Maria.</HI> Now to this day by the
foresaid name the rocke is called. From hence as soone as
the night drew on and that the winde began to blow of the
shoare, the Captaine Generall made saile, and kéeping al∣wayes

along the coaste on the Thursdaie after, béeing the
19. of September hée fell with a goodly high lande, and
harde to the same there laye sixe little Ilandes, and there
he came to an Ankor, and going a lande to take in water
did there finde a young man, which did demaund, concer∣ning
the Captaine Generall, whether he were a Moore or a
Christian, they aunswered him that hée was a christian.
This he did as it was thought with feare, least that they
should haue killed him, forsomuch as in that place there
were no christians. This young man did carrie our men
within a certeine riuer, &amp; shewed them most excellent wa∣ter
the which issued out betwéene certeine rocks, and so: his
paines they gaue him a red night cap. The next morning
following there came from the land foure others in a small
boate a boord the Captaine Generall, which brought with
them to sell many gourds and Cowcombers, and they wer
demaunded by the Generall whether there were in that
Countrie any Cinamon or Pepper. They aunswered that
there was nothing but Cinamon, and for that he was desi∣rous
to sée the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cinamon grovving.</NOTE> he sent with them two of his men, the
which at their return brought w<SUP>t</SUP> them two gréene boughs
of certeine trées which they doe take to be the same, repor∣ting
that thereof, there was a great groue, howbeit the same
was wilde. And at their retourne there came with them
more then 20. of that Countrie men, which brought to sell
hens, gourds, &amp; Cowes milke. Also they requested the Cap∣taine
Generall to send with them certeine of his men, for
that shortly after, they should retourne with greate store of
drie Cinamon, Hogges, and Hennes, but for all their great
offers, he would let none of his men goe, for that hée fea∣red
least the same was some treason. The next daye after
before dinner, our men going a lande to cut woode some∣what

shoare side.</P>
<P>The Captaine Generall woulde not immediatlye pro∣cure

for then he thought to know the same. And being in a re∣dinesse
to depart, did first commaund one of his Marriners
to go vp to the top, to sée whether that he could discry any
other vessels a sea boord or not, who being there tolde him
that he had sight of eight great ships which wer incalmed,
with this newes he left his going to sée the others, &amp; put
himselfe in a readinesse, the winde was in such sort that it
might serue them both, &amp; as they came within two leagues
of our Fléete, the Captaine Generall made toward them.
The enimies perceiuing that, did immediatly flye toward
the shoare▪ And they bearing after this sorte, was broken
the Rudder of one of the same, by reason whereof those
that were within the ship were forced to go in their boats
toward the lande. <HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> who was next to this
ship, went immediatly and layde the same aboord, thinking
indéede to finde in it some greate shore of riches, howbeit
there was nothing els but <HI>Cocos</HI> and <HI>Melasus,</HI> which is a
certeine kinde of Sugar made of Palmes or Date trées.
Also he founde therein manye bowes, arrowes, swoordes,
speares and targats, and the other seauen ranne themselues
a ground, and for that our men could not come néere vnto
them with their ships, they followed them in their boats,
and from thence did beate them with their ordinaunce, so
that their enimyes were driuen to leaue their shippes, and
béeing yet the next day at an Ankor, there came vnto him
seauen men of the country in an <HI>Almadias,</HI> who tolde him

and also two conduit heads, made of frée stone of excellent

one is sixe foote déepe. Also in the sea about the sayde I∣land

resorted thether alwayes to take in their water and wood,
and did so abuse the inhabitants that they could not wel a∣bide

their going away, they plucked downe almost all their

<P>The Iland is called <HI>Ansandina</HI> which in the <HI>Mala∣bars</HI>

who founde it according as afore is declared, and a
goodlye place or grounde, where they might newe

graue their ships. And for that the Captaine Generall had
a great course to run, and also for that he knew not when
to finde so conuenient a place, he consulted with the other
Captaines to bring their shippes there a ground. The first
ship that they brought there a grounde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They re∣paire their ships.</NOTE> was the Shippe
the which they called <HI>Ber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o.</HI> And whilest they were thus
occupyed, there came many people to sell them victualls.
At which time there came two small Brickentines that
hadde out theyr Standerds, and Flagges in the toppes of
theyr Mastes, and within them theyr Trumpettes and
Drumnies, wherevppon they came playeng, at theyr plea∣sure.
In these Brickentines there came manye men, and
they all at the Oare, and along the shoare side there were
other fiue which came to succour them if they shoulde haue
anye néede.</P>
<P>The Captaine Generall after that hée hadde fight of
them, had warning giuen him by the <HI>Malabars</HI> to beware
of them, for that they were rouers, and vnder a couloure
of peace, did robbe all that they coulde take. And after
that hée was entered into his shippe, hée perceiued that hée
might haue taken them if so bée that hée woulde haue con∣sented
to lette them to come aboorde him, but hée woulde
not agrée to the same. And therefore as soone as they came
within Gunne shotte, commaunded all theyr Ordinaunce
to be shot at them from those two shippes that were a

crieng, <HI>Tambarane, Tambarane,</HI> for so they doe call God,

did.</P>
<P>The next daye after the Captaine Generall with all
his men béeing a land, working vpon the ship called <HI>Berrio,</HI>
there came in two litle <HI>Paraos</HI> to the number of twelue men
of the Countrie, the which in their apparel séemed to bée of

some countenaunce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sugar Canes grovving there.</NOTE> who brought for a present a bundell of
Sugar Canes, and immediately as soone as they had deliue∣red
the same, they asked license to goe aboord and to sée the
ships, for that they neuer saw any before. The Captaine ge∣nerall
was greatly offended with this their request, for by
that he feared least that they were spies: and whilest they
were in this talke, there came thether other two <HI>Paraos,</HI>
with as many more men. Those that came first, séeing that
the Captaine generall was somewhat growen in cholar, did
will those that came afterward, not to come a lande but to
returne againe. The ship <HI>Berrio</HI> being made in a redinesse,
&amp; afterward that the Generalls ship was brought a ground
to be new rigged, and hauing a lande about hir, all the other
Captaines, there came a man in a little <HI>Parao,</HI> who séemed
to be of the age of fortie yeares, and not of that Countrey,
for that he had vpon him a <HI>Sabaco</HI> of fine Cotten, which
reached downe to his héeles, and about his head a toocke or
towell, which also couered part of his face, and at his gyr∣dell
a Faw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in or Skeyne. And assoone as he leapt a lande,
he went immediately to imbrace the Captaine generall as
one that had séene him or knowen him before, and after the
selfe same sort he vsed the other Captaines, telling them that
he was a Christian, and borne in <HI>Italy,</HI> and that hée was
brought into that Countrey of a childe, and that his dwel∣ling
was with a Noble man that was a Moore, called <HI>Sa∣bayo</HI>
the which was Lord of a certaine Iland called <HI>Goa,</HI>
lieng about twelue leagues from thence, and had forty thou∣sand
horsemen within the sayd Iland. And for that his ha∣bitation
was amongst the Moores, he obserued their lawe,
howbeit it was but for an outward shew, but inwardly in
his soule he was a Christian: and being in <HI>Sabayos</HI> house
it was tolde him, that there was come by Sea to <HI>Calycut</HI>
certaine men in ships, whereof there was neuer séene y<SUP>e</SUP> like
in the <HI>Indias,</HI> and that there were none that vnderstoode
their language, and also that their bodies were couered ouer
with cloathes. And when he had vnderstanding of the
same, he immediatelye iudged them to be <HI>Frangnes,</HI> for so
<PB REF="70"/>
they do call those that are Christians in that Countrey, and
for that he was desirous to sée them, had therefore asked ly∣cense
of <HI>Sabayo,</HI> saieng that if so be that he woulde not giue
him license to goe and sée them, that he knewe verye well
that he should dye with very thought and anger: by reason
whereof he gaue him license, by whome hée sent them
word, that if so be that there were in his Countrey anye
thing y<SUP>t</SUP> they had néede of, they shuld haue the same, in espe∣ciall
shippes and victualles. And moreouer, if they woulde
come and dwell in his Countrey, he would be very gladde
thereof, and would giue both them and theirs sufficient ly∣uing,
with the which they should liue very honourably.</P>
<P>After that he had ended thus his talke, the Captaine ge∣nerall
asked him perticularly for the Countrey of <HI>Sabayo,</HI>
and other things: Wherevppon he requested of the Cap∣taine
generall a chéefe for to sende to a companion of his,
which remained in the firme Lande, for that it was agréed
betwéene them, that if so be that he were well entertained,
that he woulde sende vnto him a token in signe thereof.
This kinde of dealing made the Captaine generall suspect
him, notwithstanding, he commaunded a chéefe to be gi∣uen
him, and also two newe loaues, the which he sent to
his companion as aforesaide, and he remained alwayes
talking with the Captaine Generall: His talke was so
much, that some time hée discouered himselfe to bée a
spye.</P>
<P><HI>Paulo de la Gama,</HI> which noted the same, asked of
certaine countrey men what hée was, and they vp and
tolde him, that he was a Rouer, and that he had laide a∣boorde
other Shippes, which had bene there brought a
grounde before that time. The Captaine Generall béeing
thereof informed, commaunded him to be carried aboorde
his shippe, which was then a grounde, and there he com∣maunded
him to bee well whipped to confesse, whether
that all or anye parte of the same was true that hée had
tolde him, and also what he meant by his comming the∣ther,
and whether he were a Moore or a Christian, who
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
aunswered that he was a Christian as he had said before, al
the rest he denied, &amp; therefore the General sought one other
more cruell torment then whipping, which was by hanging
of him vp by his members by a pulley, to hoist him vp and
downe: and by the great paine which he suffered there, he
requested to be let downe, for that as their he would tell
him the truth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A notable coūterfait discouered</NOTE> and being come downe, he declared that hée
was a spie, and was sent thether, to discouer how manye
men the Captaine generall had, and what weapons, forso∣much
as he was ill beloued along all that Coast, because
he was a Christian.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A kinde of boates so called</NOTE> And that there were manyr <HI>Atalayas</HI>
or Foysts placed in euery Baye or Kricke to set vpon him:
howbeit they durst not vntill such time as there came the∣ther
other fortie great Vessells, which were a making in a
readinesse for to ioyne with those that are armed, and so to
set vpon him, and to take him: and therefore in the meane
space he was sent to knowe what he sayd, he affirmed al∣so,
that he knewe not certainelye, when those fortie sayle
woulde come. This much he declared after that he had re∣ceiued
thrée or foure torments: all the rest they vnderstood
by coniectures, forsomuch as he did not perticularlye declare
the same.</P>
<P>The Captaine generall séeing that he would declare no
more, was contented with the aduice he had giuen him,
and commaunded him to prison vnder the hatches, for to
carrie with him vnto <HI>Portingale:</HI> also to be cured verye
well, and to giue him some refreshing of victualles. After∣ward
he tolde him that he did not minde to kéepe him pri∣soner
to haue him as his Captiue, but to carie him vnto the
King his Master, to the ende he might tell him some newes
of the <HI>Indias,</HI> knowing verye well that he would rewarde
him. Now the Captaine generall hauing knowledge of the
comming of his enimies, would therefore tarrie no longer
then whilest his ship was new dressing, the which was done
in ten dayes.</P>
<P>At this instaunt the Captaine generall was offered for
the shippe, the which shippe he had taken of the eight, that
<PB REF="71"/>
did set vpon him a thousand Fanons, but he wold not take it,
saieng that he wold not sell any thing y<SUP>t</SUP> was his enimies,
but commaunded the same to be burnt. The Captaine Ge∣neralls
ship being ready and the water being taken in, hée
immediately departed vpon the fifth daye of October, and go∣ing
a Sea boord, about a two hundred leagues from thaf I∣land,
then the Moore which he caried with him as prisoner,
seeing there was no other remedie, said, that now he would
tell him the truth how that indéede he did dwell with the
<HI>Sabayo,</HI> to whom word was brought that the Captain ge∣nerall
went wandring vpon the Seas, as one that knewe
not where he was, and therefore there was in preparing a
great Fléete for to take him. The <HI>Sabayo</HI> hauing notice
thereof, commaunded him to goe thether to visite him, and
to marke how they went, and also to sée whether that hée
could bring them to <HI>Goa,</HI> which if so be that he could bring
to passe, he would as then laye hand vpon them, for that the
fame went that they were valyaunt, and so meant to kéepe
them to make warres against other Kings his next neigh∣bours.
These newes the Captaine Generall was glad to
heare of, and gaue him from thenceforth better entertain∣ment,
&amp; allowed him both apparell and also money, &amp; after∣ward
he was made a Christian, to whom he gaue for name

the winde right against him, it
was the occasion that the shippes
made but small way, and therefore it was the longer time
before he entered the gulfe. But after that he was entered
within the same, he was again troubled with great calmes,
which on the Sea is very troublesome, not only for the go∣uerning
of their ships, but also with the heat, which is more
hurtfull vpon the sea, then vpon the land, for that ther is no
couering to defend the Sunne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men stif∣led vvith the Sunne onely.</NOTE> whereon with the same on∣ly

thus with the heates, the space of many dayes together, did
afterward returne and breake vp in contrary windes to go
forward, and very good to goe backward. But the Captaine
generall being loath to go backward, wold yet rather tarie
ther wher he was, as indéed he did. And when he perceiued
that the winde was so great and the Seas went so high,
that there was no tarrieng for him with his shippes, then
was he driuen of force to kéepe the Seas, sometime on this

great troubles, by reason they all had inough to doe to

there would come faire weather, were driuen once more to
pray for those great calmes which they had before. And

and had continued this kinde of weather vppon the Seas,
ther arose such a feare amongst those that did remain aliue,
that they fared in the same, as it were men amazed, and be∣léeued
verely that they should neuer goe from thence, for
that as they thought this kinde of weather was alwayes
durable there, and that the same was the cause that it indu∣red
so long. The Masters and Pilots of the Fléete were of
the lyke opinion, which made the rest beléeue it the sooner,
that by this meanes the crye of all those that were there, as
well of them that were sicke as of the other, was great,
saieng that since the weather would not serue them to goe
from thence, yet they requested him not to be an occasion
of their death, but rather consent to retourne vnto <HI>Calycut,</HI>

their right course, and therefore they met with these calmes
and windes which they indured, yet those he saide should
haue an ende, and with the same, their troubles will lyke∣wise
ende.</P>
<P>But for all this, the Marriners woulde not beléeue
him, for that in this trouble they had continued foure mo∣nethes,
and also that there were dead of theyr fellowes,
thirtie persons: so that there were so fewe of them remay∣ning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A vvofull mortalitie</NOTE>

they thought they shoulde goe no further, and as they doe

both of them Captaines made agréement each of them
in theyr Shippes to the other, that if so bée that there
woulde come anye Winde, by the which they might

doe so.</P>
<P>Béeing thus determined, vppon a sodayne there
came a fresh gale of Winde, with the which the Fléete
might goe forwarde, and with the same in sixteene dayes
they came within sight of lande, béeing on a Wednesday

forgotten theyr troubles and daungers that they were

gaue commaundement to cast about into the Sea,
so much as might bée thought sufficient for to staye vntill

standing ouer against them, thrée hundred leagues of the

sicke of the same disease, that our men were. The
morning being come he went to reknowledge the land, and
came before a goodly great Citie, which was walled round
about and within the same, very faire and high houses, and
in the midst of the same there was a great Pallaice, which
stood very high, and séemed to be of a goodly building, all this
they saw very well out of their ships. This Citie is called
<HI>Magadoxo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citie of Maga∣doxo.</NOTE> which standeth at the ende of the said goulfe in
the Coast of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> a hundred &amp; thirtéene leagues from
<HI>Mylynde,</HI> the scituation whereof I shall declare héereafter.
And for that the Captaine generall knew the same to bée a
Citie of Moores, when as hée went along the Coast,
hée commaunded to shoote of manye péeces of Ordi∣naunce,
and also for that he coulde not tell how farre hée
was from <HI>Mylynde,</HI> from thence forward he stayed in the
night, because he would not passe the same. Foorthwith, on
Saturday being the fifth of Februarie, lieng ouer against a
village of the Moores, which they call <HI>Pate,</HI> being a hundred
and thrée leagues from <HI>Magadoxo,</HI> there came from thence
eight <HI>Terradas</HI> which is a certaine kinde of Boates of that
Countrey, being all full of Souldiours, and made theyr
waye straight towarde our Fléete, fromwhence we shot so
many péeces of Ordinaunce, that they thought themselues
happy to haue escaped by running awaye. Howbeit our men
did not followe them for lacke of winde. The next Mun∣daye
following, the Generall arriued at <HI>Mylynde,</HI> and bée∣ing
there, the King sent to visite the Captaine Generall
with sundrye fresh victualls, sending him word also, how
glad hée was of his comming. The Generall aunswered

whome hée was desirous to haue cured, hée tarryed

many.

he had two issues, his taile was thrée quarters of a yard
in breadth, &amp; as much in length, his skinne, was lyke vnto
a Hogges skinne, which was a finger thicke. In this I∣lande
the Captaine generall commaunded to be erected a
high Crosse of stone, and therfore he gaue the same to name
<HI>La tierra de Santa Crus.</HI> From hence he sent a Caruell
which he brought foorth with him for the same purpose,
with letters vnto the King his Lorde, of all that which
had chaunced him vnto this place, and how that he had left
there two bannished men of those twentie, the which
<PB REF="79"/>
he carried with him, to the ende they might better enforme
themselues what Countrey that same was, and whether it
were a firme lande, as it did appeare vnto them, all, by the
great distance of the Coast that they had found, and because
of the great voyage which he had taken in hande to make,
he could not send to know perfectly. With this Caruel he
sent a man of that Countrey for a shew, by what kinde of
people the same was inhabited. This Caruell being depar∣ted,
the next day after being the second day of May, the Cap∣tain
generall departed with all his Fléete, bearing his course
toward the Cape <HI>Buena espe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ansa,</HI> the which was from
thence almost 1200. leagues, which is a great and fearfull
gulph to passe, by reason of the great windes which doe
course in those partes, most of the time. And being vnder
sayle in the same, on the xii. of Maye there appeared in the
Element a great Comet with hir beames,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Comet seene in the elemēt</NOTE> the which came
out of the Orient, and for the space of x. dayes did alwayes
appeare as well in the night as in the daye, alwayes inlarg∣ing
his beames. On Saterday being the xxiii. of May, there
came amongst all the Fléete such a storme from the North∣east,
that all the Fléete was faine to take in their sayles,
hauing the Seas very high mingled with pretie showers of
raine And for that the same storme was afterwarde some∣what
abated, they brought themselues vnder their forefailes
againe, and at night the winde being altogether calme, such
ships as wer left behind, did spred out also their sprit saile, to
ouertake those y<SUP>t</SUP> went before. And going by after windes, &amp;
following their course by the South, the Sunday being the
xxiiii. of May, the winde beganne to increase, which was the
occasion that the Captaine generall commanded their sailes
to be taken in, and to fardle vp their sprits sailes, the which
being done, the like did all the other Captaines, and going
on this sort on Sunday, betwéene x. and xi. of the clocke of
the day, did begin to ariue in the Northwest a spowte, with
the which the winde calmed in such sorte, that the sailes
did beate against the Mast, and the Pilots being (not as yet
acquainted with the secret signification of a spowte) for that
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
they had not trauayled those Seas, thought the same to bée
a signe of faire weather, and of great calmes: by reason
whereof, they neuer made any kinde of alteration in anye
thing, appertaining to their sayles. Vpon this on a Sun∣daye,
there came such a winde and so furious, that then
they had no time to amayne and take in theyr sayles, by
reason whereof, there were foure Shippes sunke without
escaping one person of them all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">four ships sunke by tempest,</NOTE> and of one of these was
Captayne one <HI>Bartholomew Dias.</HI> The other seauen re∣mayned
halfe full of water, which they had taken in, which
lykewise had sunke, if so be that parte of theyr sayles had
not bene torne.</P>
<P>And after that the winde verred to the Southwest they
bare with the same, the which was so great that they were
driuen to roue all that daye and the next night following
without sailes, so that the one could not sée the other, &amp; how∣soeuer
as yet the returne of any other wind was not come,
they were driuen to such daunger that they thought there∣by
they should loose their liues, forsomuch as the rest of the
Fléete was so cast away before their eyes, wherewith they
were stroken into a very great pensiuenesse. The next day
the winde being somewhat incalmed, with the same the
Fléete did ioyne themselues together againe, and immediat∣ly
after, the winde came to the East and Northeast, which
was so great that it made the Seas to goe higher then euer
they did before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A vvōder¦ful storme and great Seas.</NOTE> and so the same endured the space of xx.
dayes: and all this time the shippes laye a hull, although
they proued fiue times to hoyse vp their sayles, as aforesaid.
Now the Seas went so high to all theyr iudgements, they
thought it vnpossible for the shippes to escape: for ouer and
besides that, by the working of them it was thought, that
sometime they did hoyse vp theyr shippes aboue the Ele∣ment,
and other times when the shippes began to descend,
they fell as it were downe a monstrous hill, that they fea∣red
they should be all swallowed vp in the Intralles of the
Earth.</P>
<P>In the daye the water was of the colour of pitch, and
<PB REF="80"/>
in the night of fire. The tackling with the other furniture
of the Shippes, with the great force of the winde, made
such a terrible noyse, and was so fearefull to heare, that
the same is incredible to be beléeued, but by those onelye
that endured and passed the same, with the force of this,
the Fléete was separated into sundry places. The Cap∣taine
Generall bare vp with <HI>Symon de Myranda,</HI> and <HI>Pe∣dro
de Tayde,</HI> whether the winde would carry them: all
the others went at Gods mercie.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter that the Captaine Generall
had past with parte of his Fléete,
these great stormes didde finde him∣selfe
to haue doubled the Cape,
without anye sight of the same, ha∣uing
in his company no more then
two Shippes, which bare alwayes
vp with him. And the Lorde ha∣uing
vsed alwaies towardes them
his wonderfull great mercie, he came within sight of the
lande the sixtéenth day of Iuly, towarde the which he com∣maunded
to beare, howbeit the Pilots did not knowe the
same, notwithstanding they found that it stoode in the alti∣tude
of xxvii. degrées, they were so néere vnto lande, that the
Shippes laye with their beake heads close to the same.
But the Captaine generall would not consent that anye of
his men shoulde goe a lande: yet from their shippes they
might easilye perceiue, that the same was well inhabited,
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
for the great number of people they did sée there, and yet
of all those there came none to the water side, to sée what
we were.</P>
<P>After that he sawe that there was no hope to haue anye
refreshing from thence, hée did afterwarde procure the
same from the Sea, where there was great plentie of fish,
where our men was driuen to fish for it. Afterwarde
the Captaine generall commaunded to weye their Ankors,
and to followe his course, so néere vnto the shore, that he
might well sée great numbers and store of sundrye beastes,
which fed along the Riuer, that entred into the Sea, and
also they sawe many people.</P>
<P>Now going on that sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They cōe to Sofala</NOTE> the Captaine generall did passe
vnto <HI>Sofala,</HI> with the which as yet the Pilot was not ac∣quainted,
and being néere to the same, he sawe two I∣landes
and right ouer against one of them there was ri∣ding
at an Ankor two Shippes, which as soone as they
had discouered our Fléete, did beginne to flye awaye to∣warde
the shore. And for that the Captaine generall sawe
that they fiedde, he commaunded to followe them, which
was done in such sort that our men did ouertake them, and
tooke some of them prisoners, for that they did not defende
themselues, and concerning the chiefest person that was
in these Shippes, the Captaine Generall was aduertised
that he was the King of <HI>Mylyndes</HI> néere kinsman, and
was going from <HI>Sofala</HI> laden with Golde to <HI>Mylynde.</HI>
Who confessed, that when they had descryed our Ships,
they receiued such a feare, as though they shoulde bée
taken, and that therefore they did throwe the most part
of theyr Golde into the Sea, and they themselues ranne
a lande.</P>
<P>After that all this was done, y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine general told him
that he was very sory for theyr so great mischance &amp; losse,
in especially for so much as the King of <HI>Mylynde</HI> was in
so great a credite with the King of <HI>Portingale</HI> his Master,
which is the occasion, that all <HI>Portingales</HI> are and shall
bée alwayes at his commaundement. And hauing shewed
<PB REF="81"/>
vnto him great courtesie, he commaunded the Shippes to
be retourned with all the golde they hadde founde in the
same.</P>
<P>The Moore asked of him whether he had brought with
him any Witches, that they might with words of inchant∣ment
fetch vp such golde as was throwen into the Sea.
To whom the Captaine generall made aunswere, that the
Christians doe beléeue in the true God, who hath and doth
defende them so, that they doe not vse nor beléeue in witch∣craft,
and therefore they do not vse the same. Of this Moore
the Captaine generall was aduertised, that he hadde some∣what
ouer runne <HI>Sofala,</HI> and for that he would not returne
backe, he did at this time leaue it, and hauing dispatched the
Moore, followed his course, and on the xx. of Iuly arriued at
<HI>Monsanbique,</HI> where he tooke in his water, and a Pilot to
carry him to the Ilande of <HI>Quiloa,</HI> toward the which he di∣rected
his course, running along the Coast. In this his voy∣age
he saw sundry profitable Ilands which were belonging
to the King of <HI>Quiloa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Quiloa a mightie Prince.</NOTE> which as I haue declared is a great
Prince, and is Lord from the Cape <HI>De las correntes,</HI> almost

many more vnto <HI>Mombassa,</HI> with an infinit number of I∣landes,
that doth yéeld him great rents. Notwithstanding
as touching his estate it is but small, for he is not able to
make many men of warre: his abode is alwayes in <HI>Qui∣loa,</HI>
in a certaine Ilande, which is a hundred leagues be∣yonde.
<HI>Monsanbique</HI> in the Coast of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> néere to the

there is great plentie of Fish, and that verye good. So

and what there commeth from other places of the firme
land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de∣scriptiō of the city of Quyloa.</NOTE> the Citie is plentifully prouided, which citie is com∣passed

They doe apparell themselues very richly, in especiall the
women, for they carry alwaies vpon them great store of

is of the gold that commeth from <HI>Sofala,</HI> and from this citie
it is dispearsed to all the Countrie of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> &amp; other

The winter in this countrie doth begin in Aprill, &amp; ma∣keth
an end in September. The Captaine Generall bée∣ing
come to the harbour of this Citie, and hauing obteined
of the king a safe conduct that hée might send him a mes∣senger,
did send vnto him <HI>Alonso Hurtado,</HI> who went ac∣companied
with seauen of the principals of their ships, and
that they might shew themselues in more countenaunce &amp;
authoritie, they went in their best apparell. Béeing come
before the king, he represented vnto him the message which
the Captaine Generall gaue him, which was to signifie
vnto him y<SUP>t</SUP> he was come thether with y<SUP>e</SUP> king of <HI>Portin∣gale</HI>
his Maisters fléete, to settle a trade in y<SUP>e</SUP> citie, &amp; to the

is the auncient custome which the Captaines doe alwaies
obserue in his coūtry, because y<SUP>t</SUP> if so be ther shuld chance a∣ny
misfortūe to their general, which is their head, immedi∣atly
are cast away the rest that are vnder his gouernment.
To this the king made answere with a good countenance,
y<SUP>t</SUP> he was also desirous to see the Captaine Generall, and to
speak with him a sea boord, since there was no other reme∣die,
<HI>Alonso Hurtado</HI> hauing receiued this answere, made y<SUP>e</SUP>
Captaine Generall priuie therof, who y<SUP>e</SUP> next day after tar∣ryed
for y<SUP>e</SUP> king in his boat, which was couered ouer &amp; set
out with flags. There did attend vpon him al the rest of y<SUP>e</SUP>
Captaines in their boates, &amp; at this present arriued there,
<HI>Sancho de Toar</HI> with other two ships. The king thus be∣ing
looked for, at the length he came in an <HI>Almadia,</HI> béeing
well accompanied with sundrie Gentlemen in other boats,
lykewise furnished, which also were set out with flags, and
had in them those that sounded vpon trumpets &amp; cornets,
&amp; Sagbuts, which made a wonderfull great noise. Now the
king being come where the Captaine Generall was tarri∣eng
for him, all his ordinance went of in such sort &amp; with
such a force, that it made the sea to tremble, wherwith the
king and all his traine, forsomuch as they were not accu∣stomed
vnto the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mee∣ting of y<SUP>e</SUP> king &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine Generall.</NOTE> were greatly afeard. As soone as the
ordinaunce went of, the king &amp; the Captaine General met,
&amp; that with great pleasure. And after that the king of <HI>Por∣tingales</HI>
letter was read, which was for y<SUP>•</SUP> setling of a trade
in his citie, he answered that he was contented therewith,
&amp; did agrée that the next day he should send <HI>Alonso Hurta∣do</HI>
a land, to tell him the sorts of the merchaundise that he
had brought with him, &amp; he wold giue him gold for y<SUP>e</SUP> same.
Vpon this agréement <HI>Alonso Hurtado</HI> was sent a land the
next day following, howbeit he found the king far from y<SUP>e</SUP>
which was agréed vpō with y<SUP>e</SUP> captain general y<SUP>e</SUP> day before,

was for this cause, forsomuch as he was a Moore, and wée

be driuen to do y<SUP>•</SUP> by force, which he was loth to do, &amp; ther∣fore
did fortifie himselfe with many men in a readinesse.

<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
to the dwellers, that those that were Gentiles said, that
against vs there were no resistaunce. The next daye fol∣lowing
by the consent of the Captaines of the Fléete, the
Captaine Generall sent by one whose name was <HI>Gaspar,</HI>
to demaund a safe conduct of the king for to send a mes∣senger
vnto him, sending also with the saide <HI>Gaspar</HI> those
foure <HI>Malabars</HI> that <HI>Don Vasco de la gama</HI> had carried
from <HI>Calicut.</HI> These went all apparelled in a gallant sort,
after the <HI>Portingales</HI> order, whom all the citie came forth
to sée, who meruailed to beholde them to returne so well,
which was the cause that they were so well pleased with
our men, &amp; that they were had in so great reputation. But
forsomuch as these were but fisher men the king woulde
not sée thē, although he was glad to vnderstand after what
sorte they returned, &amp; commaunded y<SUP>t</SUP> the said <HI>Gaspar</HI> shuld

after that he knew wherfore he came, aunswered him, that
whosoeuer of our men would come a lande, might with∣out
any feare at all. This answere béeing come to y<SUP>e</SUP> Cap∣taine

to the king of <HI>Portingale,</HI> of the which he went for Cap∣taine
Generall, and that his comming thether was for no

for the which it was conuenient for him, to talke
with him. Howbeit hée sayde, the king his Maister hadde
commaunded him, that he shoulde not doe it, without he
might for the assurance of his person, receiue some pledges
to remaine in the shippes whilest hée was a lande with
the king, and that the one of those pleadges should be the

<P>The king béeing héereof informed meruailed much to
heare that the Captaine general did demand those pledges,
<PB REF="85"/>
which he did excuse to giue, forsomuch as they were sickly
&amp; olde, howbeit he said he would giue others that coulde
better abide the brannesse of the sea. But afterwards hée
did insist very much, not to giue any pleadges at all, forso∣much
as those that were Moores were verye sorrie to sée
our men in <HI>Calycut,</HI> and gaue the king counsell to sende
none, for that in giuing of any he might wel iudge therin y<SUP>•</SUP>
the Captaine Generall had but little confidence in him, and
by this meanes he should remaine dishonoured. Yet for al
this <HI>Alonso Hurtado</HI> did still insist in his demaunde. In
this encountrie they spent thrée daies. At the end the king
hauing a desire to haue a trade setled with ours, for the be∣nefit
that might redound vnto him by the same, did con∣sent
to <HI>Alonso Hurtado</HI> his request, in giuing the pleadges
that were demaunded, which being come to the Captaine
Generalls knowledge, he began to make himselfe in a rea∣dinesse
to goe and speake with the king, and to remaine a
land thrée or foure daies, apointing in his place <HI>Sancho de
Toar,</HI> to whom he gaue commaundement that there shuld
be made for those pleadges at their comming aboord good
enterteinment, and to looke well vnto them, and not to de∣liuer
them to any that should come to demaunde them, al∣though
they came in his name.</P>
<P>On the xxviii. daye of December the Captaine Gene∣rall
put himselfe in his best apparell, and carryed with
him thirtie of the principall men of his Fléete, which
shoulde remaine with him a lande, with others that were
the kings seruauntes, which shoulde attende vppon him
as vpon the kings own person. Hée commanded also to bée
carryed with him all the furniture for his Chamber and
Kitchin, with his Cupboorde of Plate, in the which there
were many rich péeces of siluer gilted.</P>
<P>Nowe béeing with all these thinges in a readynesse to
depart, there came from the Citie sundry principall <HI>Nayres,</HI>
which were commaunded by the king to attende vppon
the Captaine Generall, accompanyed with manye
men, besides others that came sounding vppon Trum∣pets,
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
other vppon Sackbuts and other instrumentes.
The Captaine generall being informed that the King was
tarrieng for him in a certaine Galerie, which onelye for to
receiue him in, he had commaunded to be made harde by the
water side, tooke his boate and went toward the shore, bee∣ing
accompanied with all the other boats of y<SUP>e</SUP> Fléete, which
went all in good order, and set out with manye flagges and
trumpets, which being ioyned together as wel these as those
that came from the Citie, made a wonderfull noyse. With
this came those pledges aboord the Generalls ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleadges are sent a∣boorde, vvhich feare to be taken cap∣tiue.</NOTE> into the
which they were loath to enter, vntill such time that y<SUP>e</SUP> Cap∣taine
generall did disimbarke himselfe a lande, giuing ther∣by
to vnderstand that they wer afeard that they being once
aboord, he would returne againe into the Fléete, and so take
them for captiues. They did stand so much vpon the same,
that <HI>Aries Correa</HI> was faine to tell them, that without a∣ny
suspition they might enter into the shippe, forsomuch as
the Captaine generall was not come thether for to deceiue
the King, but onely for to get his good will, with this they
were contented, to goe aboorde, yet it was with some feare,
that he would take them captiues. In the meane while that
we were about this the Captaine generall landed, where
there was tarrieng for him sundry <HI>Caymales</HI> and <HI>Pymaca∣les,</HI>
and other principall <HI>Nayres,</HI> being accompanied with
many others. And before that the Captaine generall coulde
set his féete on the grounde, he was taken vp, and put in
an Andor or chaire, in the which he was carried to the <HI>Se∣rame,</HI>
accompanied with the multitude aboue saide. Being
come to this place, he entered into a certaine house where
the King was, whome he founde in this order. The
house was hanged ouer with Carpets, or as they call them
<HI>Alcatifas,</HI> at the ende whereof, there was a certaine place
where the King was sitting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Caly∣cuts state &amp; furni∣ture.</NOTE> made much lyke vnto a lyttle
Chappell, and ouer the Kings head did hang the cloth of E∣state,
of vnshorne Crimson veluet, and vnder him and about
him, were twentie cushions of silke. The King himselfe
was all naked, sauing that about his middle he had a cloth
<PB REF="86"/>
made of Cotten, which was white as snowe, and wrought
ouer with golde. On his head he had a night cap of cloath
of golde, which was made of the fashion of an head péece or
skull. On his eares he had hanging certaine Iewelles, of
Diamonds, Saphyres and Pearles, of the which ther was
two bigger then Walnuts. On his armes from the elbow
to the hande he had sundrye Bracelettes of Golde, in the
which there were precious Sones, and that without
number, and of a wonderfull valewe. Moreouer on his
legs from the knées downward, and on the fingers of his
handes, and the toes of his feete, and especially on his great
toe, there was a ring, in the which there was a Rubie so
great and fine, that it gaue such a light as was wonderfull:
amongst al which stones, ther was a Diamond bigger then
a great Beane. But all this was nothing in comparison of
his girdell, which was made of Golde and Stone that the
same was aboue all price, and out of it there came such a
resplendour or brightnes, that it blinded mens eyes to looke
vpon it.</P>
<P>There stoode harde by him a Chaire of Estate of golde
and siluer, wrought in the best manner, full of precious
stone, and of the selfe same sort was the Andor in the which
he was brought from his Pallaice, which also stood there,
Also there were twentie Trumpets, whereof seauentéene
were of siluer, and the other thrée of golde, the mouthes
whereof, were finely wrought and set with stone. Also ther
was a Bason of golde in the which he did spit, and certaine
perfuming pans of siluer, out of the which, ther came an ex∣cellent
smell. And for estate sake ther wer lightned certain
Lampes of Oyle, which were after the Moores order, the
which were also made of siluer. Sixe paces from the
King, stood his two brethren, which were heires
vnto the Kingdome after him, and some∣what
further off stood many Noble
men, they all standing vp∣right
vppon theyr
féete.</P>

the which there shoulde be sufficient of all kinde of Mer∣chandize
that should be spent there, &amp; in trucke of the same,

sufficient lading of spices for those ships there. The King
shewed himselfe to be content with this Embassage, &amp; aun∣swered
the Captaine generall that he wold yéeld the King of

Crimson veluet a verye fine Carpet, two clothes of Arras,
the which were very rich, the one with figures, and the other
with gréene workes. Of this present, and of the Embassage
which the Captaine generall had done vnto him, as it appe∣red,
the King was very glad, and tolde the Captaine gene∣rall
that he might goe to his lodging to rest himselfe, or els
to his ships as he would himselfe, for that he thought ne∣cessary
to send for his Pledges, which are Gentlemen and
daintely brought vp, and could not awaye with the Sea, to
tarry there longer. And whilest they were ther, he was as∣sured,
that they would neither eate nor drinke for such was
their custome. And if fo be that the Captaine generall wold
goe to his ships, and come the next day againe, to make full
agréement and consent about the order of the trade in <HI>Ca∣licut,</HI>
he would then send those Pledges againe. The Cap∣taine
generall hauing good confidence in those his wordes,
went to his ships, leauing behinde him with his stuffe, <HI>A∣lonso
Hurtado</HI> with other seauen. And being at the water
side ready to departe, a seruaunt of one of those Pleadges,
went before aboord in a small Pinnace, and tolde them that
the Captaine generall did retourne aboorde, this messenger
was sent by the commaundement of the Clearke and Con∣troller
of the Kings house, as who shoulde saye, to giue
them counsayle to come their waye, which they did, as
soone as they heard what the slaue had tolde them in their
language, and with that they leapt into the Sea, thinking to
take that Pinace in the which the slaue went. As soone as
<HI>Aries Correa</HI> saw this, he leapt into his owne boate, which
was harde by the ships side with certaine of his Marriners
and rowing with force tooke two of the Pledges, and also
thrée or foure of those that wore in the Pinace, the other
fled and carried the Catuall with them, which was also one
of the Pledges. This being concluded, the Captaine gene∣rall
came aboord, who after that he had knowen what had
passed, because that those Pledges the which he had in his
custodie, should not returne and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their waye, he com∣maunded
them to be put vnder the hatches of his ship, and
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
afterward sent to complain to the King of that which they
had done, laieng all the fault vpon the Clarke Controller.
Also he sent worde after what sort they remained in his
ship, promising, that if so be y<SUP>t</SUP> he wold send him his stuffe, &amp;
such of his men as remained a land, he would immediatly
sende those Pleadges which he had: and for that it was
night, there was no more at that time done. The next daye
following, the King came to the water side, accompanyed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> xii. thousand men, and sent with the Captaine Gene∣ral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
stuffe and men, to the number of thirtie <HI>Almadias,</HI>
for that they might returne with those Pledges that did re∣maine
aboord, howbeit for all that they were so many, yet
there durst none of them come néere the ships, for the feare
they stoode in of our men, which remained in the Fléete, least
they wold take them, and so they returned with the same a∣gaine
to land. The Captaine Generall séeing the feare that
they stood in of his Fléete, sent the next daye in certaine of
his owne boates those Pledges that he had in custodie, com∣maunding
that they should goe and sée them deliuered som∣what
aloofe of from the fléet, that brought him his men and
stuffe. And while they were deliuering the same, <HI>Araxame∣noca</HI>
which was the eldest of the Pledges, leaped into the
water vppon a sodaine, with intent to runne away, but for
all that he could not escape, forsomuch as our men caught

which did offer himself to carry the same, when all the rest of

king made answere y<SUP>t</SUP> he was well pleased to agrée to haue

forasmuch as he was a friend to y<SUP>e</SUP> Moores of <HI>Meca,</HI> which
were great enimies vnto our men, not onelye for that they

shuld loose part of ther credit which they had in <HI>Calicut,</HI> by

conceiued of them many times, the Gentiles durst not come

better estéemed. And that was the cause that alwaies. <HI>Aries

them all, the which he woulde haue bought. And al∣though
he had offred for him more then he was worth, yet
he would not sell him. Albeit the owner was a dweller in
<HI>Coching,</HI> and therefore he most earnestly requested him to
send to take the sayd shippe, forsomuch as it did so highlye
touch his honour and credit: vnto his request, the Captaine
Generall made aunswere that he would doe it with a good
will, although that he was informed that the sayd shippe
was great, and that there were within it very many men
both Marriners and souldiers, and that the same could not
bée taken without some losse of men, and therefore it was
requisite that he consented that his men might kill those y<SUP>•</SUP>

concluded, the Captaine Generall commaunded that <HI>Pedro

ship, and that there should goe with him a young Gentle∣man
called <HI>Edwarte Pacheco,</HI> which was thought to bée a
valiant souldier, and with these there was a 60. men.

of the Factor &amp; countenance they had at the kings
hand, did set vpon the Factorye, where was slaine
in defence there of the Factor with other of his
company. Cap. 36.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Y meanes of this subtile dealing of the
Moores, there past thrée moneths before the
Factor could get any spices more then hée
had, to lade two ships withall: which was
a great griefe to the Captaine Generall,
forsomuch as thereby he perceiued verye
well that the friendship of the king was not steadfast, but
that he was a lyar, and a man that vsed no truth at all.
And if so be that he had not tarried there so long time as
he did, fearing that in no other porte hée should finde suffi∣cient
lading for his shippes, he would haue fallen out with
him, and so haue gone to some other place. But forasmuch
as he hadde bene there at so greate charges, he dissimuled
therewith onely to sée whether with his good will he might
lade there or no. The Captaine Generall séeing that all
thinges were but delayes, sent vnto the king, requesting
him to remember those promises he hadde made vnto
the Factour, that within twentye dayes he woulde de∣liuer
sufficient lading for the whole Fléete, and that nowe
there were thrée moneths past, and yet there was no more
laden then two shippes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king accused plainly of doblenes.</NOTE> The occasion whereof he did not
knowe, and therefore he was the willinger to suffer the
same, and that with great patience, hoping alwayes that he
wold giue order for the lading of the rest of the Fléet. But
now he sawe howe all things went, and knew that it was
impossible to make an ende thereof.</P>
<P>For although he had promised that his Fléete should be
the first that should be laden before any other straungers,
<PB REF="93"/>
and that he was enformed for most certeine, y<SUP>t</SUP> the Moores
had bought for a lesse price great store of Spices, and sent
the same to other places, whether they would, he therefore
requested him yet to haue him in his remembrance, y<SUP>t</SUP> now
it was time for him to depart towards <HI>Portingale,</HI> desiring
him to dispa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h him as he hadde promised. The King as
soone as he had heard what the messenger sayd, did shewe
as in an outward appearance greatly meruailing that our
ships remained yet vnladen, and aunswered that hée was
very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore, and that he could not beléeue that the
Moores contrarie to his commaundement had bought spi∣ces
vnder a coulour, and sent the same a boorde some other
ship whether it pleased them, he hauing giuen commaun∣dement
to the contrarie, namely, that the Moores should not
buie any spices in hugger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gger. Affirming that if it bée
so they had so deceiued him, he woulde punish them there∣fore.
Vpon this immediatly he gaue commaundement to
take those shippes that were laden with Spices, with con∣dition
that they shoulde pay for the same the price that the
Moores had bought at.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nothing more ac∣ceptable to the Mores thē to quarell &amp; fall out vvith our men,</NOTE> The newes was brought forthwith

vnto them, then to haue occasion to fall out with our
men, so therefore did one of the principall Moores beginne
to lade his shippe first, and that openlye with all sortes of
Spices and Drugges. And for that cholar might the more
increase in our men, to take those spices, hée found meanes
that certeine Moores which the Factor tooke to bée his ve∣rye
friends, and also certeine Gentiles, shoulde make him
beléeue that if so be that hée did not send to take that ship,
that was a lading, that then he could not haue lading suf∣ficent
for the Fléete.</P>
<P>The Factor gaue credit vnto this report, and therevpon
sent worde to the Captaine Generall, what the Moores and
Gentiles had tolde him, and that he thought their sayeng to
be true. And therefore since the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> had giuen
him license to take all such Spices as the Moores had la∣den,
hée might the better nowe take that Shippe.
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
Howbeit the Captaine general was loath to deale therwith
for all the Kings license, for he knew him to be an incon∣stant
man, and waying also the great credit, that the Mores
were in with him, he was afeard least that after they had
taken the said shippe, the Moores through the Kings fauour
would rise against them. And this was the aunswere that
was sent to the Factor: yet for all that he did require him
once more to take that ship, saieng, that if he did not, that
then the King shuld be in hazarde to loose such Merchandize
as he had ther: neuerthelesse the Captaine general wold not
meddle therewith, and yéelding for that his determination
sufficient reason to the contrary. But the Factor on y<SUP>e</SUP> other
part ceased not to make vnto him sundry requests, and pro∣testations,
that he should paye all such losses and damages,
as should hap vpon the King of <HI>Portingales</HI> Merchaundize,
by his defaults, for that he woulde not deale with the sayde
ship. Thus since he saw there was no other remedie, he cō∣sented
therevnto, although it were against his will: &amp; ther∣fore
the xvi. day of December, the Captaine generall sent
word to those that were aboord y<SUP>e</SUP> ship, that was thus laden
by the Moores, by the order which was sent him from the
King of <HI>Calicut,</HI> to commaund them to depart, and for as∣much
as they made but little reckoning thereof he sent the
next daye all his boates to bring hir within the harbour.
After that this report came to the owner of the ships know∣ledge,
they made the Moores priuie héereof, whereof they
were very glad, for that by this meanes there was offered
vnto them occasion to fall out with our men. Héerevppon,
they began in a furious outrage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moores moued a tumult a∣gainst our men.</NOTE> running out of their dores
like madde men, complaining vpon vs and our people, by
meanes whereof, they were tumulteously moued, and fra∣med
great outcryes and larums, and alwayes against our

King, with whom went the owner of the ship, complaining
also vpon our men for the detaining of his ship, saieng that
our men had bought and laden much more spices &amp; drugs,
then that the Merchaundize came vnto which they hadde

brought with them, howbeit their pride was such, that they
were content with nothing; but as Théeues and Pirates
would haue all. At this instant came the Moores, which did
before helpe him very much, declaring many things against
our men, &amp; how much the King was in fault, for suffering
them within this Citie, requesting him most earnestlye to
giue them license to reuenge their losse, which they had re∣ceiued.
The King as he was inconstant and without anye

had obtained their request,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sa∣uage firce¦nes of the Moores a¦gainst our men.</NOTE> they came their waye from the

driue their enimies from thence, &amp; at the very shutting vp

Howbeit the multitude of them at that present was so great

which was past, wherevnto if he would willingly yéelde,
then would he be content,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Calicut vvas farre off from making a mendes.</NOTE> so that he might ther haue his la∣ding.
But the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> was farre off from the mat∣ter,
for he was very glad of that which y<SUP>e</SUP> Moores had done,
and commaunded all such Merchaundize to be taken, as

thousand duckets, &amp; also take all such of ours as wer found
aliue for captiues, although they were hurt, of the which
there were foure that died. After all this, the Captaine gene∣rall
séeing that in all that daye the King of <HI>Calicut</HI> sent no
messenger to excuse himselfe of the fact, he put the matter
in question, wheras it was determined that he forthwith
shuld reuenge those iniuries that were past, for feare least∣if
he should delay so to doe, that then the King might haue
time to arme his Fléete, which would not then be so easelye
done. This being determined our men put themselues in a
readinesse, to lay aboord x. great ships, which lay in y<SUP>•</SUP> harbor
full of Moores: these at the first would haue defended them∣selues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iust re∣uenge vvrought vpon the iniurious Calicuttās</NOTE>
yet for all y<SUP>t</SUP> our men did ioyne with them, &amp; fought
with them so valyantly, that they brake their order, killing
many of them, and of those that remained some leaped into
the water and were drowned, others hid themselues in their
ships, and other were taken aliue, whom the Captaine ge∣nerall
commaunded to prison, that they might afterwarde
serue for Mariners in the Fléet. The ships being thus come
into our mens possession, they found within the same some
Spices and other Merchaundize which were hidden within
them: also they found thrée Elephants, which the Captaine
generall commaunded to be killed and salted for their victu∣alls,
he commaunded also those Moores that were slaine to
be told, and there was found of them 600. The ships being
discharged of all that they had, they wer set a fire before all
the Citie, in the sight of many that came to the water side
to succor them, whom being Moores, as they were comming
in their <HI>Almadias,</HI> our men encountered and fought with
them, but they durst not goe forward for feare of the ordi∣naunce.
This was a wonder to those of the Citie, to sée ten
ships burnt together. The King also was sory therefore for
that he could not send to succour them. But if that which
was done this day was a wonder to the enimies to behold,
then y<SUP>e</SUP> next day was much more to be meruailed at, for the
Captaine generall not being contented with the burning of
these ships commaunded his ships in the night to be brought
<PB REF="96"/>
as néere the shore as he could, the one somewhat separated
from the other. They had also their boats before them, that
they might reach the most part of the Citie. As soone as the
morning began to appeare, immediately all the great Ordi∣naunce
went off amongst their houses, which after that the
enimies had séene, and how néere our ships lay to the shore,
they began to shoote at thē with smal péeces which they had
without hurting any of our men, howbeit of our ordinance,
for that the enimies came running in flockes, there was no
péece that mist, and by that meanes there were manye that
fell, and the others that drew towards the Citie, where our
ordinaunce also had made a great destruction, as well in the
Temples of their Gods, as in their dwelling houses. The
feare was so great amongst the Citizens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The feare that the King of Calicut and the citizens were in.</NOTE> that the King of
<HI>Calycut</HI> himselfe was driuen to leaue his Pallaice, and to
goe out of the Citie, for that our men went thether to séeke
him out with their pellets, so that hard at his héeles they kil∣led
a <HI>Nayre,</HI> which was a noble man, and ouerthrewe part
of the Kings Pallaice. This destruction dured no more but
this daye: and whilest it was a doing, there appeared two
ships y<SUP>t</SUP> wer comming to the harbor, which as soone as they
had discried vs, went their way, &amp; therefore this fight ceased.
The Captain generall made after thē w<SUP>t</SUP> al his fléet to <HI>Pan∣derane,</HI>
which is a Port not far off, where there was other
seuen néere to the land ready to succour them, in which there
came a multitude of Moores to defend them, and for that our
ships could not come néere vnto the shore, they lefte them.
And the Captaine generall contenting himselfe with that
which he had done in <HI>Calycut,</HI> for that it was verye late to
make his voyage toward <HI>Portingal,</HI> went toward <HI>Coching,</HI>
&amp; ther concluded a peace, to sée whether he might lade ther,

and when they were discharged of certayne
Rice which they carried, the Generall caused them to be set

xx. of December, which standeth in the Prouince of <HI>Mala∣bar,</HI>
xix. leagues from that parte of <HI>Calycut,</HI> going into the
South,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coching standeth in 9. de∣grees, and the scitu∣atiō ther∣of.</NOTE> and being in ix. degrées toward the North. The sci∣tuation
therof is along the riuer, in the which the Sea doth
enter, by meanes whereof the Citie standeth as it
were in an Ilande and that verye strong, for that there
is no comming to it, but by certaine wayes. It hath belon∣ging
vnto it, a goodly great and a sure Port, which lyeth be∣fore
the mouth of this riuer. The land round about is wa∣try
and low, and made into Ilands: they haue smal store of
victuals, but for all that those which they haue is very fresh.
This Citie is buylded much after the manner of <HI>Calycut,</HI>
and is inhabited by Gentiles and sundry Moores strangers,
which are come thether from manye places, and are great
Merchaunts, amongst whom there are two that haue fiftie
shippes a péece.</P>
<P>In this Countrey is great store of Pepper, and the most
parte that they haue in <HI>Calycut</HI> commeth from thence.
But forasmuch as in <HI>Calycut</HI> there are more store of Mer∣chaunts
which come from other places, therefore the same
is richer then <HI>Coching.</HI> The King is a Gentile, and is
of the behauiour and propertie of the King of <HI>Calycut:</HI>
howbeit he is verye poore, by reason his Countrey is but
small, neither can he commaund any money to be coined in
his Citie.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Coching</HI> are in great subiection to the
Kings of <HI>Calicut,</HI> for as often as ther chanceth a new king to

succéede in <HI>Calycut,</HI> he immediately goeth to <HI>Coching,</HI> and
dispossesseth him that hath the same, of the whole kingdome
and taketh possession himselfe therof, so that by this meanes
it lyeth in his hands, whether he will restore that King to
the crowne againe or not. Also the King of <HI>Coching</HI> is
bound to aide and accompany the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> in bat∣taile
against any other King, also he is bounde to dye in the
religion of the King of <HI>Calicut.</HI> The Captaine generall, be∣ing
come to this harbour, did there let fall his Ankor, for
that he was afearde to send <HI>Gaspar</HI> with a message to the
king, least he would runne awaye, he choosed rather to send
one whose name was <HI>Michael Iogue,</HI> which although hée
were a Gentile &amp; a straunger, yet he came vnto our Fléete,
with intent to turne Christian, saieng that he would goe for
<HI>Portingale:</HI> wherevpon the Captaine generall tooke occasi∣on

for such commodities as there were in <HI>Coching,</HI> with the
which if so be that the King wer not contented, that then he
would buy the same for ready mony, wherof he had brought
with him great store, and therefore his request was that in
trucke of his merchandize, or for his ready money he would
giue him lading for foure ships. The answere that the king
made to this messenger, was, That he was very glad of his
comming to this his Port, for that he was wel informed of
his strength and valiantnesse, and therfore he estéemed them
all the better, as héereafter he should well perceiue. And as
for such Spices as he had there, he would giue him y<SUP>e</SUP> same
in trucke of his Merchaundize y<SUP>•</SUP> he had brought with him
from <HI>Portingale,</HI> or els for money as he should thinke best.
And also that without any feare he might send a land whom
he should thinke good to prouide the said lading, &amp; for the as∣surance
of such as shuld trauel about y<SUP>e</SUP> same he sent him 2. of
y<SUP>•</SUP> principal <HI>Naires</HI> in pledge, vpō cōditiō y<SUP>t</SUP> euery day he shuld

chaunge them and take others, for that all such as did féede
a sea boorde, could not come anye more in the kings pre∣sence.
The Captaine Generall was well contented there∣with,
who had the sending of those pleadges so quietly a
boord, for a good beginning, and therfore he sent immediatly
for Factor of this lading <HI>Gonsallo Gilbarbosa,</HI> which
was sent before with <HI>Aries Correa,</HI> and for his Scriuenor
he sent <HI>Larenco Moreno,</HI> and for Interpretour one cal∣led
<HI>Maderade Alcusia.</HI> Also the Captaine Generall com∣maunded
to be deliuered vnto them and to serue them in
all kinde of affaires, foure banished men.</P>
<P>The king hauing notice of the comming of the Factor
a land, sent to receiue him the Rogedor of the Citie, who
went accompanyed with many noble men of the Courte,
who brought them before the king. This king euen as his
rents did farre differ in value from the king of <HI>Calycuts,</HI>
so he did also differ very much in his estate, not onely for y<SUP>e</SUP>
furniture of his person, but also of the place in the which
he was in. For there appeared nothing else but the verye
bare walls. The king himselfe was sitting within certeine
grates, made much lyke a Theatre, with the which the
whole house was compassed aboute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Coch∣ing much inferior in vvealth &amp; state to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Calycut.</NOTE> and there was

the Captaine Generall sent him, which was a Bason of
siluer to wash his hands in, full of Saforne, and a greate
Ewer of siluer full of rose water, besides certeine braun∣ches
of Corall, this present the king receiued very ioyful∣fully,
giuing vnto the Captaine Generall great thanks for
the same, and after that he had talked a while with the fac∣tor,
and with <HI>Larenco Moreno,</HI> he commaunded them to
be lodged, and so there remained those thrée a land, besides
the other foure banished men. But the Captaine Generall
would not consent there should remaine a land anye more,
for he iudged that the fewer ther remained a land, the few∣er
would be lost if so be that there should chaunce the lyke
misfortune to that which did in <HI>Calycut.</HI> Howbeit that was
<PB REF="98"/>
farre vnlike, for y<SUP>t</SUP> the king of <HI>Coching</HI> séemed to be a man
inclined to vertue &amp; all the loialtie in the world, which wel

dispatch he made for the lading of our ships with spices, &amp;
in the commanding of helpe to be giuen by those of y<SUP>•</SUP> coun∣trie,
which they did so willingly and with so great a zeale,
that the same séemed to be ordeined of God, that the trade

how the King of <HI>Cananor</HI> shewed himselfe very curteous.
This as it appeared, was written by <HI>Pedro de Tayde,</HI> to
aduertise all such Captaines as should passe by to <HI>Calycut.</HI>
The Captaine generall with the other Captaines perusing
this letter, did then determine, y<SUP>t</SUP> it was not requisit, to leaue
the Caruell in <HI>Sofala,</HI> for that they had but few men, which
was not aboue foure score. And with this they thought it
conuenient to go to <HI>Quiloa,</HI> where they founde a banished
man, whom <HI>Pedro Aluares</HI> had left there, who likewise in∣formed
the Generall, what <HI>Pedro Aluares</HI> had past in <HI>Cali∣cut,</HI>
the which he had learned of certaine Moores, and also of

And being there arriued, there came in vpon a sodaine, sea∣uen
great shippes of <HI>Cambaya,</HI> which were bounde into the

but afterward he commaunded to set the same a fire. And

they did lye: whereof the King hauing knowledge, from
thence foorth he had them to his Pallaice, and so commaun∣ded
from that time forwarde the <HI>Nayres</HI> to take a care of
them. Moreouer, he was told what ill sales he shoulde finde
there of such Merchaundize as he had brought, for that the
Moores had perswaded the Merchaunts of the Countrey to
giue lyttle for the same: and also aduised those that sell the
Pepper and other Spices, that they should not sell the same
but for ready money, and not in trucke of Merchaundize: &amp;
therefore they tolde him that if so be he had brought no mo∣ney
to buye their Spices withall, that then he should make
no reckoning of the same. And therefore for that the Ge∣nerall
had brought none, he would tarrie there no longer,
but returned to <HI>Cananor,</HI> to take in there his lading, where
the King was so great a friend to the King of <HI>Portingale,</HI>
that when he vnderstood, that he had brought no money, he
remained his suretie for a thousand Quintall of Pepper, &amp;
for fiftie of Ginger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euerye Quintall is a 100. vvaight.</NOTE> &amp; for foure hundred &amp; fiftie Quintall of
Cinamon: besides some linnen cloath, which is made of <HI>Al∣gadon,</HI>
vntill such time he had made sales of all such Mer∣chandize
as he had brought with him, which he had lefte in
<HI>Cananor,</HI> in the hands of a Factor &amp; two Scriuenors, and so
<PB REF="104"/>
from thence he should returne with the first winde, y<SUP>•</SUP> which
as then did begin to blow, and therefore he would tarry no
longer. To the intent therefore they shuld not depart with∣out
their lading, he shewed the Captaine generall this plea∣sure.
The Captaine generall seeing this his curteous dea∣ling,
did commend vnto his custodie certaine of his men, the
which he left with him, for that he had sent with <HI>Pedro Al∣uares

taken in, then on the xv. of December, ther did appeare
in the Sea lxxx. <HI>Paraos,</HI> which were past the Mount <HI>Dely.</HI>
Whereof the King hauing knowledge, he sent word imme∣diately
to the Captaine generall, that those were the Fléete
of <HI>Calycut,</HI> that came onely to set vpon him, and therefore

&amp; their ordinance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Calicut sent lxxx. Paraos to fight with y<SUP>e</SUP> captain generall</NOTE> vnto which y<SUP>e</SUP> captain general made

in a readinesse. The next day following, which was the
xvi. day of December, before y<SUP>•</SUP> dawning of y<SUP>•</SUP> day, ther was
come into the Bay to the number of 100. ships and <HI>Paraos,</HI>
which wer all full of Moores, béeing sent of purpose, for that
the King of <HI>Calicut</HI> was informed, that they were there ta∣king
in of their lading, so that he thought by that meanes
that neither ship nor man should escape, and therefore they
lay as they did about the Baye. As soone as the Captaine
generall had viewed them, he remoued from the place wher
he was at an Ankor, and brought himselfe into the middes
of the Baye, leauing order with his ships, that they should
lay on loād with their ordinaunce which they had, with the
which he commaunded them foorthwith to begin to shoot off:
which was done in such sort, that they did neuer cease. And
if so be that he had not done so, doubtlesse the enimies wold
haue laid their ships aboord, by reason there were so manye:
So that it was vnpossible for him to escape, if God of his
goodnesse had not fauoured him, and prouided by his mercie,
that the enimies brought no Ordinaunce with them.
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
Wherefore they were the bolder to dispend amongst them
their shot, with the which there were many very sore hurt,
ouer and besides great numbers that were slaine, and their
ships and <HI>Paraos</HI> sunke, for they durst not venter to lay our
ships aboord, nor yet had killed or hurt any of our men. The
fight dured vntill such time it was Sunne set, then the eni∣mies
helde vp a flagge. But, for that he feared they meant
thereby some deceipt, he did not leaue off shooting: for other∣wise
they might haue thought he had so done, for y<SUP>t</SUP> he was
wearied, or els for feare. But it was nothing so, for they did
it for the desire they had of peace, in respect of the hurt and
losse of their men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This flag was a sign &amp; request of peace.</NOTE> which they had receiued at our mens
hands, whereby they were driuen to such necessitie, that if
so be that the winde had serued, they had hoysed vp theyr
sayles and gone theyr way, and therefore they kept vp their
flagge. The Captaine generall perceiuing their meaning,
(and for that the most part of his Ordinaunce was broken,
with the continuall shooting thereof, did answere them with
another flagge, which was done by the councell and consent
of the other Captaines: and immediatelye vppon the same,
they sent a Moore, which came in a small Boate vnto him,
whose message was, to demand peace till the next day, which
was by him graunted, with this condition, that they should
tarrie no longer in the Baye, but go into the open Sea, &amp; so
they did. The generall (although y<SUP>e</SUP> wind was partly against
him) made likewise his course into the Sea, although it wer
troublesome vnto him. The Moores could not doe the lyke,
for their shippes and <HI>Paraos</HI> can beare no sayle but with a
forewinde. Yet for all the trouble that was past, the Gene∣rall
came to an Ankor hard by them, and for all that he vsed
in the night a great and vigilant watch, by the which they
hearde the enimies rowing in their boates towardes our
Fléete, yet before that they were knowen, they wer almost
vpon him: their intent as it was presupposed, was to set our
Fléete a fire. The Captaine Generall fearing this, com∣maunded
to vyere more of the Cabells, that he might bée
the farther off from them.</P>
<P><PB REF="105"/>
And perceiuing that the enimies did yet followe them, he
then commanded a péece to be shot of at them, with y<SUP>•</SUP> which

<SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F all these letters and messages, the King
of <HI>Coching</HI> woulde neuer make the Cap∣taine
generall priuie, vntill such time that
he was ready to depart, and then he tolde
him, which before he was loth to doe. And
for that he should not conceiue and thinke
him to be so vaine as to alter his minde to doe as the King
of <HI>Calycut</HI> would haue him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great friendship and con∣stancie in an heathē Prince.</NOTE> he did therefore shewe him∣selfe
to be so constant, and such a friend of the king of <HI>Por∣tingales,</HI>
that for his sake he woulde aduenture to loose his

him great thankes, saieng, that the King his Master would
neuer forget that good will: and in his name he promised
to fauour and succour him in such sort, that he shoulde not
onely haue his kingdome in great assuraunce, but also that
he would ayde him to conquere others. He willed him also
not to feare those Letters that the King of <HI>Calicut</HI> hadde
sent him, for that they were nothing els but to put him in
feare, and bring him to be a traitor as he was, being there∣fore
so destroyed, and that from henceforth there shoulde bée
made such cruell wars against him, y<SUP>e</SUP> he shuld haue inough
to doe to defend himselfe, much lesse to make warres against
others. All this he tolde him, for the succour of those ships
which should remaine in the <HI>Indias.</HI></P>
<P>These wordes were spoken afore many of his <HI>Nayres,</HI>
of the which the King was verye gladde that they heard
them. And for that we had knowledge that in respect of the
friendship that they had with the Moores, they were verye
sorye that we had the Factory graunted in <HI>Coching.</HI>
Therefore the Captaine Generall promised vnto the King
that from <HI>Cananor</HI> hée woulde forthwith sende him the∣ther
a Fléete of ships, from whence he was minded to de∣parte.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112"/>
Now after that he had laden his ten shippes, and was a
Sea boorde, thrée leagues from <HI>Pandarane,</HI> he had know∣ledge
of the nine and twentie great shippes of the Moores,
that went to séeke him out. And as soone as he had sight of
them, he consulted with his Captaines to fight with them,
vpon whom with the winde that did begin to blowe, they
did beare.</P>
<P>This being agréed vppon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A battaile by sea be∣tween our ships, and the kings of Calicut</NOTE> the Generall began to beare
toward the Enimies. <HI>Vincente Sodre, Pedro Raphael,</HI> and
<HI>Diego Pieres,</HI> for that theyr ships were great saylers, went
before them all, and these were the first that did giue the on∣set
vpon two of the chiefest ships. <HI>Vincente Sodre,</HI> fought
with the one alone, and <HI>Pedro Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Diego Pieres</HI>
with the other. Their méeting was with such a valyaunt
minde, that out of both the Enimyes shippes there leapt
many into the Sea. The fight indured no longer, but vn∣till
such time the Captaine generall with the other shippes
drewe néere, who did alwayes shoote off at them. In the
meane while the rest of the Enimies did beare all that they
could towarde the shoare. The Captaine generall for feare
of the losse of some of his shippes, would not followe, the
rather for that they were all laden: Howbeit, our men
leapte into theyr boates, and there fought with those that
were swimming in the water, and slewe them all: the
which were néere to the number of thrée hundred per∣sons.</P>
<P>After this the Captaine Generall commaunded to dis∣charge
theyr Shippes, which were taken, in the which
was founde store of rich Merchaundize:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rich price takē from the enimie.</NOTE> and amongest
the same these péeces following: Sixe great Tynages of
fine Earth, which they doe call <HI>Porcelanas,</HI> and the same
is verye costlye, as by experience thereof we do sée in <HI>Por∣tingale:</HI>
foure great <HI>Guyndes</HI> of siluer, with certaine
perfuming Pannes of siluer: also they there founde, cer∣tayne
Basons of siluer and gylte, in the which they doe
vse to spit. But that which excéeded the rest, was an Idoll
of Golde, which weighed thirtie pounde waight, with a
<PB REF="113"/>
monstrous face and for his eyes he had two verye fine E∣merauldes:
a Vestement of beaten golde, wrought and set
with fine stone, the which vestement belonged vnto this I∣doll,
with a Carbuncle or Rubie in his breast as bigge as a
<HI>Crosado,</HI> which gaue as great a lyght as it had bene a fire.
The ships being set a fire, y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine general departed to∣ward
<HI>Cananor,</HI> wher he was with the King, who gaue him
a house for the Factorie, the possession whereof was taken
by <HI>Gonsallo Gill Barbosa,</HI> who was appointed for Factor,

and by the Interpretour, called <HI>Edwarte Barboso,</HI> and sun∣dry
others, in all to the number of twentie, of all whom the

and bound himselfe to lade from thenceforth all the
King of <HI>Portingales</HI> ships of Spices, that they should at a∣ny
time haue néed of, and this at a certaine price which was
immediately named. The Captaine generall did enter into
the like bonds in the name of the King of <HI>Portingale,</HI> to de∣fend
him from all those that shoulde make him warres for
this cause. Also the King of <HI>Cananor</HI> did the lyke, and to
remaine the King of <HI>Cochings</HI> friend, and not to helpe nor
aide any that should come against him, vpon paine that wée
should make him warres: and of all this, there were suffi∣cient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order that vvas giuen to Vincente Sodre, at the depar¦ture of the Cap∣taine ge∣nerall frō Cananor.</NOTE>
great and lawfull writings made on all parts. After
this, the Captain generall sent <HI>Vincente Sodre</HI> to go along
the Coast, and to kéepe the same vntill Februarie. And if
in the meane while there were any newes or knowledge of
any lykelihood of warres, betwéene the King of <HI>Coching</HI> &amp;
the King of <HI>Calycut,</HI> that then he shoulde Winter there in
<HI>Coching:</HI> but if not, that then he should go to the straights
of the red Sea, to take such ships of <HI>Meca,</HI> as doe passe to
the <HI>Indias.</HI></P>
<P>This being dispatched, and those thrée shippes laden
with that they should haue, they departed toward <HI>Portin∣gale</HI>
with thirtéene shippes, the twentith daye of Decem∣ber,
in the yeare of our Lord 1503. and so arriued with all
their ships at <HI>Monsanbique.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="113"/>
And for that the ship that <HI>Steuen de la Gama</HI> went in had
a great leake, he commaunded the same to be vnladen and
brought a ground, and after that she was newlye rigged,
they departed. And within seauen dayes after, there fell a
great leake in the ship y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Lewis Cotine</HI> was in, &amp; for that it
was in such a place that they could not come by it, they
were therefore driuen with all the Fléete to retourne to
<HI>Monsanbique,</HI> to new rigge the same. Now the winde was
scant, they were faine to remaine in a certeine créeke, vntill
she was finished, and afterwarde they retourned to their
voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They vvere dis∣persed by a tempest</NOTE> and at the Cape of the Correntes they were
so ouertaken with stormes which came sodeinly, and with
such a force vpon them, and that against them, that they
were forced to stay there with all the Fléete. The ship that
<HI>Steuen de la Gama</HI> went in did beare vp onely with her

he lost the companie of the whole Fléete, and was no

Mast broken. This storme being past from this Cape of
the Currents, the Captaine Generall followed his course
toward <HI>Lishborne,</HI> where he arriued the first day of Sep∣tember.
All the noble men of the Court went as farre as
<HI>Cascaes</HI> to receiue and accompanie him till he came to the
king. He had going before him his Page, which carryed a
Bason of siluer, within the same was layde all the tribute
which the king of <HI>Quiloa</HI> had paide. Béeing come where
the king was, his grace honourably receiued him, according

was to discouer the <HI>Indias,</HI> and to leaue setled Factoryes

so he marched toward the village of

did all things contrarie to iustice and equitie. And
since he did the same vnto those that are of his sect, and
all most naturally borne with him, why should he not doe
the like vnto the christians which are our enimies? And for

our men vnto him, since the warres were begunne in
respect of vs and for our sakes, they did put in hazarde the
losse of their kingdome. The king meruailing much of the
boldnesse of his subiects, aunswered them with louing
wordes, saieng that they had offended him verie sore with
theyr vaine speach, assuring them, that if so bee that the
king of <HI>Calycut</HI> woulde come and séeke him out, yet hée
woulde notwithstanding defende himselfe, onely for that

dealing in defending those christians, as he had taken vp∣pon
him to doe. But for all this his subiects coulde not bée
well pacified, whereof some were desirous to set vppon our

them a gard to attend vppon them, and also appointed a
strong place for their lodging. Vpon this, there came newes
that <HI>Vincente Sodre</HI> was come to <HI>Coching,</HI> who had left
greate hurt done along the coast of <HI>Calicut,</HI> both by water

<P>Of whose comming all our men were very glad,

perceiuing that they came not a land, sent the Captaine ge∣nerall
word by <HI>Laurenco Moreno,</HI> the certeintie they heard

the king of <HI>Portingales</HI> that he would not leaue them so,

men, then I, and you for my sake, and generally
all the <HI>Malabars</HI> ought to beare the same greatly vnto the
Moores, for that it is well knowne, that it is sixe hundred
yeare since they came into the Prouince of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and
in all this time, yea, to this daie, there was neuer anie that
euer receiued at theyr handes anye hurt or losse. But ha∣uing
no sooner receiued straungers newly come into anye

wheresoeuer they doe beginne to settle theyr trade. But
the Moores doe trade with the people with all friendship,

an other, by whose meanes the Countrey hath béene al∣wayes
well prouided of much victualls and merchaun∣dise,
which hath béene a cause to enrich our Townes; and
that our rents are greatly increased, in especiall within
this our Citie. For whilest the Moores are héere resident,
they haue made the same the greatest mart Towne that
is in all the <HI>Indias.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>For this cause I am bounde in conscience, and haue

that they were héere: as in taking of my Captaine Ge∣nerall,

cause, that the Moores did as you doe heare, and as I maye
iudge by the sequeale thereof, was so ordeined of God for

they burnt ten of my shippes which lay with∣in
my harbour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After all this, they with theyr Ordinance destroyed my
Citye, so that I was driuen to runne awaye out of my pal∣laice.
Not contented with this, they burnt me other two
shippes, which they woulde not haue done if so be that they
had come to settle a trade. But first of all since they found
themselues agréeued, they shoulde haue come and made
theyr complaint to mée of the Moores, and tarryed till I had
punished them, and not to doe as they haue done, by which
it was apparant, that they are théeues and no Merchants,
as they name themselues to be, that vnder this coulour, they
might conquere the whole Countrie. Which things the

vnto, although I sent him worde. And being as he is, my

These words were spoken by <HI>Nambeadarin,</HI> with such
a stomacke and so lyberally to the King, that they were by
him well taken: In one respect, for that he was a very va∣lyaunt
Gentleman, and in another, for that he was with
him in great credit and authoritie. And for this cause they
hadde him in great reputation: Insomuch, that if the

Howbeit, they stood vppon their reputation so much,
that they thought it would be a great imbasing to their cre∣dite,
in especially hauing assembled so great a power as the
King had done, and not to goe forward, or at the least to do
some what afore they did retourne. By meanes whereof, it
was possible, that the King of <HI>Coching</HI> hearing of theyr

not otherwise doe before, béeing prayed. After all this,
the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> would néedes know of his Witches,
what daye was good to march forward in with his Armie,
who appointed him a fortunate one, and promised him the

<HEAD>¶Of the great feare that our men were in, least the

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F all this, whatsoeuer hadde past, was the
King of <HI>Coching</HI> aduertised, by sundry es∣pyes
which he had in the Campe of y<SUP>e</SUP> king
of <HI>Calycut:</HI> and therefore he stoode some∣what
in feare of him, for that he hadde not
sufficient men to defend himselfe, forasmuch
as all those that he hoped had fauoured him, were tourned a∣gainst
<PB REF="118"/>
him: yea, euen those that were his owne subiectes,
whome if he hadde on his side, he had bene sure to haue
giuen the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> the ouerthrow. Therefore, for
that he had but few men, he was greatly afeard thereof, and
the rather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The very sight of our men abhorred in Co∣ching</NOTE> for that of those there, the most part serued him
against their will, in especially they that were dwellers in
<HI>Coching,</HI> which did abhorre y<SUP>e</SUP> very sight of our men, where
vpon they openly spake it, that it were good that the King
of <HI>Coching</HI> should deliuer our men to the king of <HI>Calycut,</HI>
or els that he put them out of <HI>Coching,</HI> and so he might ac∣quite
himselfe of these warres. Moreouer, there were many
of the inhabitants of <HI>Coching,</HI> that ranne their wayes, and
left their houses, and all for feare of this warre. Our men
also on the other parte were gretly afearde to sée this tu∣mult,
which gaue them occasion to waye the daunger that
they wer in, for all that the king did warrant them. Wher∣fore
the Factor fearing the successe thereof, procured ly∣cense
of the King to goe to <HI>Cananor,</HI> hoping that there, they
should be very quiet, vntill such time the fléete should come
from <HI>Portingale,</HI> thinking that the King by this meanes,
should breake vp those warres, that were pretended against
him, and also his Subiectes be the better contented there∣with.</P>
<P>But at those words the King séemed to be in heauines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun∣svvere vvhich the king of Coching made to the factor</NOTE> &amp;
tolde the Factor, that now it appeared very well, that he had
but small confidence in him, that he would aske him license
to depart, and therfore he told him he would giue him none:
but rather requested him earnestly not to haue any such mi∣strust,
for he there gaue him his worde, and it stoode him so
much vpon his credite, in preseruing them all alyue, that he
would rather loose his Kingdome and lyfe withall, then de∣lyuer
them to the King of <HI>Calycut,</HI> or to other that should
doe them any harme. And if so be that his euill Fortune
were so great that he should loose <HI>Coching,</HI> yet there would
not lacke a place of sufficient strength to sende them vnto,
vntill the comming of the next Fléete from <HI>Portingale</HI> to
the <HI>Indias.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="118"/>
And although sayd he, the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> shoulde come
with a great power, yet for all that he is not assured of the
victory: for it is séene many times that few with valyant
hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fevve ha∣uing the right on their side, preuayle most times a∣gainst nūbers that come in an euill cause.</NOTE> doe giue the ouerthrowe vnto great numbers with∣out
strength: much more hauing as I haue, Iustice &amp; equi∣tie
on my side. And therefore he willed them to be quyet,
&amp; to pray vnto their God to giue him y<SUP>e</SUP> victory. With these
words, knowing well that the King did speake them with a
louing minde, our men remained somewhat eased of the
feare wherein they were, and would haue kissed his hands,
but he would not suffer them so to doe, nor yet woulde a∣grée
that they should helpe him in his warres, which they
did offer him to do, but aunswered them, that he would not
place them in anye such daungerous place, for that it stoode
vpon his credite so much to kéepe them alyue. And for that
they should remaine as witnesses, how much he did trauell
to saue their lyues, therefore from thencefoorth he committed
the kéeping of them vnto certayne <HI>Nayres,</HI> such as he had a
confidence in.</P>
<P>And that this mutenie might cease, and they from thence
foorth not haue anye occasion to murmure against our men,
he commaunded to be called afore him all his Noble men,
such as were with him, and also certaine of the principall
<HI>Nayres,</HI> which were the occasion of all this trouble, &amp; spake
vnto them after this manner.</P>
<P>I Cannot but be verye heauie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Co∣chings O∣ration to his noble men.</NOTE> to sée so lyttle truth re∣mayne
in you: For I meruayle nothing at all at the
rusticall sorte of men, whome oftentimes their pouertie
enforceth to vse all kinde of villanye. But of you, I doe
greatlye meruayle that are <HI>Nayres,</HI> that haue bene alwaies
true in your dealyngs, that you now would haue me break
my worde and promise, <Q>that I haue alreadye giuen to the
Captayne Generall, concerning these Christians, which
was to kéepe his men to the vttermost of my power, and
to looke that no man shoulde doe them anye harme or
vyolence, but alwayes for to haue as good a regarde
<PB REF="119"/>
vnto them as vnto mine owne naturall subiects. And there∣fore
he left them in this my Citie, which was done also by
your consents. And since you doe perceiue, that the King of
<HI>Calycut</HI> hath a fewe more men then I, ye would perswade
me to doe contarry to my promise: so that if I were of so
ill a nature as you would haue me to be, then ought you of
all other to abhorre me, and crye out vpon me. Be ye héere∣in
your owne Iudges, If you remained with anye other
King vpon his word, would you allow that as well done in
him, which you would haue me doe, by these Christians?
In especiall, counting him as we account of this man, for
our enimy, hauing none occasion so to be, as the King of <HI>Ca∣licut:</HI>
and I your King, hauing no occasion to deliuer you,
as I haue none to delyuer these Christians? Which, since
it is so, what is the councell that ye minde to giue me héer∣in,</Q>
that may not be reprhended in another? If it be for that
you are afeard of the King of <HI>Calycut,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is bet∣ter to dye vvith ho∣nor, then to lyue vvith the infamous name of a rude and lieng Prince.</NOTE> then know this, that
it were better to dye an honourable death then to liue with
dishonour, then which there cannot happen greater to mée,
then to breake my word, nor yet more infamie vnto you,
then to be subiects to a rusticall and a false King, in especiall
against these Christians, who haue brought me so great pro∣fite
as they haue done. And as for the King of <HI>Calycut,</HI> hée
well knoweth that if he wold haue consented that the Fac∣torie
might haue bene setteled in his Citie, he might haue
<Q>kept them in his Countrey. But now because they are
gone he mooueth these warres, the rather, for that hée well
knoweth my power is but small, and therfore mindeth to
reuenge on me the losse he hath receiued. If his meaning be
none other, then to hunt these Christians out of the <HI>Indias,</HI>
and to fight with him, whosoeuer receiueth them into his
Countrey, why then doth he not beginne his warres first
with the King of <HI>Cananor?</HI> But that is not the occasion
onely, but the enuie which he hath to sée me benefited, and
for that with his pride he supposeth, that I am not able to
resist him. All this doe I very well vnderstand, and moreo∣uer
I doe receiue comfort in preseruing of these Christians,
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
hoping in God, that he therefore will giue me the victory a∣gainst
him. And as touching you that are my friends, I
pray you therefore to stand to me.</Q></P>
<P>Now all that were present héereby, séeing this his deter∣mination,
meruailed greatlye at his constancie, and craued
pardon at his hands for the feare they found themselues to
be in before, promising all of them to lyue and dye in his

after this, he commaunded the Factor to be cal∣led

<P>Although now the King of <HI>Coching</HI> had very great lack

as the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> had written vnto him. Neuerthe∣lesse,

<P>With this aunswere was the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> so of∣fended,

hée departed from <HI>Repelyn</HI> the last daye of March,
and entered into the Lande of the King of <HI>Coching,</HI> in the

<P>Whervpon the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> tooke this for an ill be∣ginning:

<P>At this present, were with him <HI>Laurenso Moreno,</HI>

For he thought that immediately vpon his comming to this

another messenger to the King of <HI>Coching,</HI> that hée
foorthwith should send vnto him those Christians: who an∣swered,
that since he would not delyuer them before time,
when as he had occasion somwhat to feare his power, what
shall he thinke he would doe now, when he hath the aduan∣tage?
But he aduertised him to looke well vnto himselfe, for
that now he would not be contented onely with defending
his Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A stout stomacke of a prince▪</NOTE> but hoped to giue him y<SUP>e</SUP> ouerthrow: which

remained in some feare, and indéed without any hope of

<P>But this pollicie was preuented by <HI>Naramuhin,</HI> who

as it was, made of timber, was as strong &amp; faire as though
it had bene made of lyme and stone. It was builded square,
and within the walls from the one side to the other, it was
square euery way nine fathome. The walls were made of
two orders of Palme trées and other strong timber, firmely
set into the ground, and yoked together with hoopes of yron,
and nayled with great nayles. Betwéene the two orders of
trées, they were rampered vp with much earth &amp; sande, and
at the ende of each of these Corners, wer builded bulwarks,
which were replenished with Ordinaunce. Also there was
cast about the same a Caue or Ditch, which alwaies was
full of water. The next daye after that this Fort was en∣ded,
there was made a solemne Procession, in the which,
went the Vicar of this Forte, who rarried in his hande a
Crucifix vnder a Canapie, which the Captaines caried ouer
him, sounding before the same their Trumpets, with great

the Vicar did blesse. And by commaundement of the Cap∣taines,
they caused the same to be called <HI>Manuel,</HI> in perpetu∣all

about to prouide. In the meane while that our men were
there, and whilest that the one ship tooke in his lading, the
other two kept abroad in the sea, to watch all such as past
by from other places and those that they could discrie, were
brought, some with their good wills, and others there were
brought against their wills, to speake with <HI>Alonso de Al∣burquerque,</HI>
and to shew him obedience as to a Captaine
general of y<SUP>e</SUP> king of <HI>Portingales.</HI> He offered no hurt to any,
but onely to the Moores of the red sea: for all such of them

and afterward to be burnt, in reuenge of that they had done
to <HI>Pedro Aluares Cabrall,</HI> of the which those of <HI>Coulan</HI>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LL these things remaining in this
order, there was sent a messenger to
<HI>Francisco de Alburquerque</HI> from
<HI>Cosebiquin,</HI> a Moore of <HI>Calicut,</HI>
which was a greate friend of ours,
as I haue before declared, signifi∣eng
that the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> was de∣termined
to set vppon <HI>Coching,</HI> im∣mediatly
after he was gone to <HI>Por∣tingale,</HI>
and so take the same, and to fortifie it in such sorte,
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
that he might defend the entering into the harbour, what∣soeuer
armie should come. And for the furtheraunce of this
enterprise, he had gotten the good will of all the nobilitye
of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and that also for certeintie it was bruited, that
the king of <HI>Cananor</HI> and the king of <HI>Coulan</HI> would secretly
aide him. Ouer and besides all this, that the Merchauntes
Moores did offer him great helpes toward the same. After
the selfe same sorte, did <HI>Francisco Reynel</HI> write vnto him a
fewe dayes after, and how that the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> was
preparing of souldiers, besides that hée had commanded much
ordinaunce to be made, and that the Moores of <HI>Coching</HI> were
greatly in his fauour, and therfore he did aduertise him not
to trust much vnto them: within two daies after the receipt
of these letteres, the king of <HI>Coching</HI> wēt to visit <HI>Francisco
de Alburquerque,</HI> and after the same manner told him that
which he had learned of certeine <HI>Bramenes</HI> that came from
<HI>Calycut,</HI> and willed him to beware &amp; to foresée what daun∣ger
he was in to lose <HI>Coching,</HI> if so be that ther did remaine
no armie of defence for that purpose. Laieng further before
him, how many daungers he had bene in for the maintei∣naunce
of our friendship, and for that cause his owne sub∣iects
had risen against him, and that nowe they minded to
doe the like. Yet notwithstanding he had such a hope in our
men, and our helpe, that he desired none other succour for to
defend him from his enimyes, whereof he praied him not
to say him nay.</P>
<P>VNto this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene¦rals cōfor∣table aun∣svvere vn∣to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Co∣ching.</NOTE> <HI>Francisco de Alburquerque,</HI> aunswered him,
that if so be that he did well knowe whether hée hadde
gotten, by such losses as hée hadde receiued, for the fauour
which he had shewed vnto our men, he would receiue other
greater losses if it were possible. For setting a side the great
renoune and fame which he hadde gotten of a true and
valiaunt Prince, <Q>hée hadde also recouered for a friende the
king of <HI>Portingale,</HI> which is Lorde of such subiects as hée
hath séene, who also are his to obeye and serue him in all
thing, when néede should require.
<PB REF="135"/>
And farther, that they would with small trouble make him
Lord of greater cities then <HI>Coching,</HI> and that also he might
beléeue, that euen as they did restore him vnto his estate,
euen so they would conserue him in the same. And although
that there were made with the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> the grea∣test
peace that could be, yet he sayde he had so small a confi∣dence
in his dooings, that he would not leaue him without
an armie of ships, before that he departed from the <HI>Indias,</HI>
for that he did well know, how little truth that King vsed.
And if so be, that vntil this time he had dissembled with him,
it was onely to sée whether by this meanes he might lade
his ships, for otherwise he could not do it, in especiall y<SUP>e</SUP> time
being as it is so néere spent.</Q></P>
<P>With this aunswere, the King was satisfied: and since
that <HI>Francisco de Alburquerque</HI> could haue no more Pep∣per
then that he had, which was but a small quantitie, hée
determined to depart toward <HI>Portingale,</HI> but first he would
nominate him that should remaine in the <HI>Indias</HI> for Cap∣taine
generall, that the King of <HI>Coching</HI> should vnderstand
the same. And for that he knew, that he that was appoyn∣ted,
would thinke it very dangerous to remaine there, with
so few men as he was able to leaue him, he durst commit
it to none of his Captaines. Howbeit after that he had offe∣red
the same to them all, and they were not willing to ac∣cept
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edwarte Pacheco apointed Captaine generall for the Indias▪</NOTE> last of all he gaue the gouernment to <HI>Edwarte Pache∣cho,</HI>
who did accept it with a great good will, more for to
serue God and his king, then for any profite he knewe that
hée should get in remaining in the <HI>Indias.</HI></P>
<P>And when it was once spread abroad &amp; knowne to the
king of <HI>Coching,</HI> that <HI>Edwarte Pacheco</HI> was he that was
appointed, he was well pleased therewith, for that he hadde
heard before of his valour. This being concluded vppon,
<HI>Francisco de Alburquerque</HI> made saile, carrieng with him
all the rest of the Fléete. But first he gaue the king to vn∣derstand
that he did carry the same no further then to <HI>Ca∣nanor,</HI>
for because of the Fléete of <HI>Calycut,</HI> which might en∣counter
with him, and so worke him some displeasure in his
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
Port, where he minded to stay (as he did) procuring the ly∣bertie
of <HI>Rodrigo Reynel</HI> and the others that were there.
This determination being knowen to the King of <HI>Ca∣lycut,</HI>
he sent him word, that it were not requisite that hée
should haue him away, but rather offered him, if so be that
he would tarrie, to giue him the Pepper that he had promi∣sed
to delyuer. But hearing this, he supposed that he gaue
the same out, that <HI>Rodrigo Reynel</HI> with the others, should
be the more desirous to remaine in the <HI>Indias.</HI> At this in∣staunt
came in <HI>Alonso de Alburquerque</HI> which retourned
from <HI>Coulan,</HI> and the time being spent, he would not tarrye
there any longer, but with the rest went toward <HI>Cananor.</HI>
And being there arriued, there came a letter from <HI>Rodrigo
Reynel,</HI> in the which he wrote vnto him, that the King of
<HI>Calycut</HI> was certainly bent to set vpon <HI>Coching,</HI> immedi∣ately
after that he were gone. And that all those dissimula∣tions
which he did vse in offering to giue him Pepper, was
but for feare he had conceiued that he would haue burnt his
ships, which were as then in his harbour. This newes the
Captaine generall kept close to himselfe, that the same shuld
not come to y<SUP>e</SUP> eares of <HI>Edwarte Pacheco,</HI> vnto whom was
lefte the shippe in the which he went, and two Caruells, of
the which were Captaines <HI>Pedro Raphael</HI> and <HI>Diego Pi∣eres,</HI>
besides a shippe boate.</P>
<P>Also they lefte him foure score and tenne men, and those
whole, that were néedfull, for all the rest were sicke. Also,
there was left him, the most parte of the Ordinaunce, with
the most parte of the munition that they were able to spare.
Now being knowen to them all, of the great power that
the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> had in a readinesse, they did then mer∣uayle,
that <HI>Edwarte Pacheco</HI> would accept the same, in espe∣cially,
for that he remayned with so small a Fléete. Some
therefore there were that gaue out and sayde, God haue
mercie vpon <HI>Edwarte Pacheco,</HI> and those that doe remayne
with him: supposing that in very déede, he shoulde not es∣cape.</P>
<P>And although these words were spoken within his hea∣ring,

in <HI>Cananor</HI> to take in there his victualles, brought him∣selfe
vnder sayle, and came to an Ankor without the point
of <HI>Cananor,</HI> and from thence hée sent <HI>Pedro Raphaell</HI>
to goe a long the Coast, and to cause all such Shippes as
he coulde discrye to beare with the Captaine, and to re∣knowledge
him for their Generall. At this instaunt was
<HI>Diego Pieres</HI> a newe rigging of his Caruell in <HI>Coching.</HI>
And all these Shippes that were brought before the Gene∣rall,
gaue an account whether they were bounde, and
what they carryed, and also of whence they were. And if
so bee that hée founde anye Pepper, hée woulde take the
same, as hée did from some other shippes that were bound
to <HI>Calycut,</HI> in the which order hée vsed such rigour, that
afterwarde hée was feared of all men.</P>
<P>Whilest hée was thus at an Ankor, there came vppon
him in the night a Fléete of twentye and fiue Saile of
Shippes, which vppon a sodeine made him to coniecture
that they were of <HI>Calycut.</HI> And séeing himselfe in such
daunger, hée commaunded to let slippe their Gabells by
theyr Halsis, for that vppon such a sodeine they coulde not
weye theyr Ankors with theyr Capsteines, and with the
same he cut and made his course into the Sea, to bring
himselfe in the winde of those Sayles, vppon whome hee
commaunded to shoote off all his Ordinaunce. And as they
were shippes laden with Rice, so ranne they their waye as
fast as they coulde. Some there were that ranne a grounde,
and more hurt had bene done, had it not béene for a greate
ship of the Moores that came in their company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A valiant skirmish vvith an hot ship of the Moores.</NOTE> in the which
were well néere to the number of 400. Moores, that were of
the kingdome of <HI>Cananor.</HI> These thinking that they might
take our shippe, came sodeinly vppon them, alwaies shooting
of their arrowes, and we aunswering them likewise with
our Ordinaunce. This skirmish continued till it was al∣most
day, and then they tolde what they were. After that <HI>Ed∣warte
Pacheco</HI> had thus well beaten him with his Ordi∣naunce,
with the which were nine of his men slaine, besides
many that were hurt, they tolde what they were.</P>
<P><PB REF="137"/>
And for that there durst not passe anye Ship by for feare
that they shuld be taken, the Captaine Generall departed to∣wards
<HI>Coching,</HI> and in the waye he fought with certeine
ships of the Moores, some he burnt, and others hée tooke, be∣side
those that were sunke. Thus with greate victorie hée
arriued at <HI>Coching,</HI> and landed at the Castle, where he vn∣sterstoode
by the Factour, that the newes of the preparation
that the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> had made for the warres was most
true, and that the king of <HI>Coching</HI> stood in greate feare
thereof, for that the Moores that were inhabitantes of <HI>Co∣ching,</HI>
were against their king for the mainteining of these
warres against the king of <HI>Calycut.</HI> The next day follow∣ing
the Captaine Generall went to visite the king of <HI>Co∣ching,</HI>
carrieng his boats with him well armed and fenced,
with certeine paueises made of Boordes, and sette with
Flagges, besides certeine Ordinaunce which they had in the
same, with the which he shewed himselfe to be verye ioy∣full,
the rather that the king might take occasion to be mer∣rie:
who after that he vnderstoode how small a fleete there
was left to defend his countrie withall, he could not bée but
verye pensatiue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What great feare y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Coching vvas put into by his traite∣rous sub∣iects.</NOTE> and sayde vnto the Captaine Generall,
that the Moores of <HI>Coching</HI> hadde tolde him that hée did not
remaine in the <HI>Indias</HI> to defende him from the king of
<HI>Calycuts</HI> power, but to gather together the Merchaundise
that were in the Factorye in <HI>Coching,</HI> and in the Factors
custodie, with all those that were there, and so to carry them
all to <HI>Cananor</HI> and <HI>Coulan.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore hée earnestlye requested him to tell him
if it were so or not, for hée did thinke the same to be true,
by reason that there was lefte so small a Fléete. Which
the rather also made him to doubt that hee would not tar∣rie
to fight with the king of <HI>Calycuts</HI> power, but woulde
doe as the Moores hadde tolde him, wherefore hée prayed
him to aduertise him of the truth thereof, for that if it were
so, hée might in time séeke his reuenge, although as then hée
should hardlye finde the same, since he had no further
helpe.
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
The Captaine Generall perceiuing the distrust that the
king had, was offended therewith, and aunswered him,
saieng.</P>
<P>I Doe much meruaile of thée (considering that thou hast
so great experience of the fidelitie of the <HI>Portingales</HI>)
that thou doest aske me whether I doe remaine for so trai∣terous
an act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun∣svvere vvhich the Captaine Generall made to y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Coching.</NOTE> as this is, that in such a time I should do as
the Moores haue told thée, &amp; thou wilt beléeue them, know∣ing
that they are so greatly our enimies. Thinking that
thou vnderstanding of this, shouldest not bring in question
such a matter out of all reason. <Q>And if so be that <HI>Francis∣co
de Alburquerque</HI> would haue done any such thing, it
had bene a great deale better that he with all his Captains
had done it, and not haue left me alone to do the same, &amp; to
runne in daunger, and to méete on the seas with so great a
fléet of the kings of <HI>Calicut,</HI> for them to set vpon mée only.
And if it were so that I should haue remained for to haue
done so foule a déede, yet I would haue tolde thée thereof,
that I had so meant to doe, for that I was afearde of the
king of <HI>Calycuts</HI> power. But for that I doe take thée to be
a man indued with reason, I did suppose that thou woul∣dest
not haue thought ill thereof. For otherwise those bée∣ing
warned thereof, it might haue bene very profitable vn∣to
thée, to haue remained frée from the enuie and mallice of
the king of <HI>Calicut.</HI> Which thing if so be that the Moores
had considered of, they would not haue tolde thée so great a
fable. Beleeue me, if they could haue done thée a greater in∣iurie,
they would haue done it, for the good will thou doest
beare vnto vs. This I doe knowe very well, but let not
that trouble thée. For although thou doest loose them, and
all the rest of thy subiectes, yet thou doest recouer me, and
as many <HI>Portingales</HI> as héere remaine, who all will die in
thy seruice if it were néede, for that is the onely cause wée
did remaine in the <HI>Indias,</HI> and in especially: for there was
no man that bound me therevnto, if so be y<SUP>•</SUP> I wold not, but
only the fidelitye &amp; truth which thou hast alwaies vsed to∣wards
<PB REF="138"/>
our men vntill such time as thou diddest loose <HI>Co∣ching,</HI>
and diddest sée the same burnt. For the which cause
thou oughtest to estéeme the better of thy selfe, for thereby
thou hast exalted thy fame through all the Countrie, and
therfore thy name wil remaine for euer, which is the grea∣test
treasure that kings canne leaue behinde them, and the
onely thing that all men doe séeke for. And beléeue me, when
the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> did first set fire to <HI>Coching,</HI> the same
was his destruction, which was afterwarde well reuen∣ged
vppon thine enimies by the <HI>Portingales,</HI> &amp; so thou shalt
now bée as well defended by them. And although thou do∣est
thinke vs to bée fewe and a small Fléete, yet I doe pro∣mise
thée, that very shortly we will séeme to bée verye ma∣ny
by our valyantnesse.</Q> And I hope in God that we shall
so defend whatsoeuer straight or passage the king of <HI>Caly∣cut</HI>
shall enter into,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fevv va∣liant men are better thē many more na∣ked and cowardly▪</NOTE> where assuredly we will tarry and not

therefore it skilleth not, there remaine no more for the ri∣uers,
for that these are sufficient. And since that they chose
me to remaine, <Q>beléeue certeinly that they did well knowe
they left him that shal excuse thée of thy trauaile, and of the
wearieng of thy men. And therefore be thou merrie and re∣solue
thy selfe (that by Gods grace) it shall not happen now
vnto thée as héeretofore it didde, when thou diddest loose

commanded to be fortified with stakes, that ther might en∣ter

all that they could to leaue the citie, that y<SUP>e</SUP> king might

Generall a while, howbeit to disappoint them of their
suttle dealing, and that the same shoulde take no effect, hée
thought it necessarie to execute this principall Moore, that
the others might conceiue some feare thereof. This béeing
knowne to the king of <HI>Coching,</HI> he woulde not consent

shuld be no victualls brought into the citie, for that those did

and therefore he thought best to dissemble with them all.
The Captaine Generall séeing that the king woulde not

for honest men as you are. I doe desire you that you do not
dishonour your selues, nor yet doe to me so great an iniu∣rie,
in hauing no confidence that I will defend you: for I

a greater power then any the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> canne make.
For therefore and for this cause was I chosen, and those
that did appoint me to remaine in the <HI>Indias,</HI> did know of
the warres that the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> intended, and what
power he had, in respect whereof I doe once againe request
you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An hard thretning but poly∣tike and necessary.</NOTE> to beléeue that the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> shall neuer set his

you doe remoue, for whosoeuer doth otherwise shall well
vnderstand, that if so be I may take him I will hang him,
and so I sweare by my lawe. And moreouer I giue you to
vnderstande, that none of you all shall escape, for héere in
this port I doe minde to tarrie, watching both day &amp; night.
Now therfore let euery one of you looke to that which shall

behoue him, and if so be you doe performe that which I
haue requested you, doe you then assure your selues to haue
me for your friend, and if not, for your mortall enimie, and
more cruell then you would wish me to bée to the king of
<HI>Calycut.</HI> And therfore each of you, speak plainly your mind
what you will doe héerein.</Q></P>
<P>This béeing spoken, it gaue him occasion to encrease his

so lowde, that the Moores with the same did double theyr

immediatly he would haue hanged them all. Wherfore pre∣sently
they began to excuse themselues, touching that hée
charged them with all, but he woulde not tarrie the hea∣ring

<P>He had also many <HI>Paraos,</HI> which he hadde caused too bée

there was none that durst venture to doe it, for feare of the

how little he did estéeme the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> and his
power, and armie of ships, did one night set vpon a towne
of the countrie of <HI>Repelyn,</HI> at such houres when all were

came many Naires,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cap∣taine gene¦rall &amp; his men infor¦ced to re∣tire vnto theyr boates.</NOTE> as wel of the towne, as also from other

forced to retire, &amp; that with great daunger, vnto his boats,
with fiue of his men hurt, and of his enimies there were
many slaine and hurt, &amp; yet for all that, those enimies that
remained aliue, followed him a good while. And as our men
returned toward <HI>Coching,</HI> there were shot by them so ma∣ny
arrows which fell vpon their boates, that their targets
were all couered with the same.</P>
<P>This being knowne to the king of <HI>Coching,</HI> that he was

<PB REF="141"/>
that enterprise for a great matter, in especially the king
of <HI>Calycut</HI> béeing there present, who had in a readinesse so
greate and mightie a power, and so he saide. At the

tolde him that he woulde desire no more but that the King
of <HI>Calicut</HI> would once come, for that he woulde fight with
him a battaile, and then woulde be apparaunt the valiant∣nesse
of his men. They of <HI>Coching</HI> béeing now all quiet, as
also the Captaine general hauing made vnto the principals

a few with their Caléeurs, which were there tarying for

with their arrowes, shot of at our men, in such ma∣ner
that they séemed to shadow the Element, yet with the
paueices of our boates, the which were made of boards of
two fingers thicke, much like vnto Targets or shields, we
did so defend them of, that they wer driuen to row toward

But afterward they fled apace, &amp; many of thē in the conflict,

after that our men had set fire to the towne, and the same

our men being come to the passage of <HI>Cambalan,</HI> the <HI>Cay∣mall</HI>
sent to make peace with the captaine generall, with a

make peace with him, for that he was an enemie vnto the

<P>To the which the captaine generall answered, that the

of the daye, which was a solemne feast amongest
the Christians, adding moreouer y<SUP>t</SUP> his wytchys had disap∣pointed
&amp; deceyued him much, to promise him the victory in
such a day. Then a certaine <HI>Nayre</HI> which came with this
Messenger, hearing the Captaine generall say so, answered

him, and that with a smiling countenaunce, as though
he had mocked him, that there were very few men to doe
y<SUP>•</SUP> which he spake of: &amp; also y<SUP>•</SUP> the king of <HI>Calicuts</HI> men were
so many, y<SUP>•</SUP> they were sufficient to couer the whole earth &amp;
the water. Which if it be so, how (said he) can they be ouer∣come.
With this answere y<SUP>•</SUP> Captaine generall was great∣ly
offended, &amp; for that he was thought to be one of the king
of <HI>Calicuts Nayres,</HI> he boxt him well, willing him to bid
the kings of <HI>Calicut</HI> reuenge the same. With the which the
others that came with the message, were so greatly afraid,
that they neuer durst afterward auouch the king of <HI>Calicut.</HI></P>
<P>That same euening the King of <HI>Coching</HI> sent to ayde
the Captaine Generall with fiue hundred <HI>Nayres,</HI> of the
which he made no account, nor of the others before, for
that he knew they would all run away. In our men,
next vnder God, hée had his confidence and whole truste,
who all that night made greate feaste, that the kinge of
<HI>Calicut</HI> might vnderstande that they did not feare him,
but rather shewed great forwardnes to geue him y<SUP>•</SUP> battell,
of the which y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine general was very glad. And ther∣fore
before it was day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cap∣taine gene¦rals words spoken vn¦to his mē.</NOTE> he spake vnto al his men in this mā∣ner.
Masters and my friends, for the great content that I
doe finde in you. I doe for most certain prognosticate the
great gift y<SUP>t</SUP> God in his seruice wil geue vnto vs this day.
And I doe beleue for most certaine, <Q>that as God hath geuē
vs stomacke (being so few as we are) to dare tary &amp; abide
so many thousands of men as there are of our enemies: so
he will geue vs force and strength to resist them, &amp; herein
wil shew his great power, &amp; as it were a miracle so greate
as this is, in y<SUP>e</SUP> exalting of his holy faith: and in his holye
name I do desire you, that you wil so beleue, for y<SUP>t</SUP> without
this hope, although we were as many as the enemies are,
and they as few as wee bee, yet all our strength were
nothing, and being in this hope, all the multitude of the
enemies will séeme vnto vs but few to ouer come: for
they doe iudge vs to be many more then wee are, their
feare is such. And this also you may beleeue, that if their
<PB REF="143"/>
comming as at this day with their great presumption bée,
for that they are many, hauing most assured hope to take vs,
yet they will haue a feare from hence forth, so that theyr
spirits will be broken, to set vpon vs any more, which thing
if they did, it would be more for feare of the king of <HI>Caly∣cut,</HI>
then for any good zeale they haue vnto him. And there∣fore
I pray you remember, that with this confidence you
must fight, and God shall giue you the victorie, and that
with honour of all the <HI>Portingales,</HI> and a perpetuall fame
amongest the straungers, and deserts before our king, that
he may reward you for the same, wherby you shall the bet∣ter
mainteine your selues all the dayes of your life.</Q></P>
<P>Vnto these words they all aunswered, that in the bat∣tell
he shoulde well sée how well they did remember his
speach. And immedialy they fell vpon their knées and sung
the <HI>Salue regina</HI> in tune, &amp; afterward an <HI>Aue Maria</HI> with
a lowde voice. At this present came <HI>Larenco Moreno</HI> from
the Castle, who brought with him foure of his Caléeuer
men, for they would néeds exercise themselues in this bat∣tell.

was Prince of <HI>Calycut</HI> and <HI>Namboa</HI> his brother, and the
king of <HI>Calycut</HI> himselfe, who had a great number, which
for that they were many, I doe not rehearse. The sortes of
instruments that they had for the wars were so many and
diuerse, that when they began to play vpon the same, it was
thought that heauen and earth woulde ioyne together.
Ouer &amp; besides the great multitude of the people, the which
did couer the whole earth. Those that went in the vangard,
as soone as they came to their setling, did giue fire to theyr
ordinance, which as they lay néere to the Caruel, so it appe∣red
partly a miracle, that there was no péece that did hurt
it. Howbeit our Ordinance béeing shot off, did all light full
amongst the enimies, and killed many of them, although it
was before day, the which vntill Sunne did rise, were in
discharging out of the Caruell, aboue xxx. péeces.</P>
<P>After all this, the whole Fléete of the enimies beganne
to come out of the riuers of <HI>Repelyn,</HI> which were 169.
Foystes, that is to say, thrée score and sixe <HI>Paraos,</HI> the which
hadde theyr defence of sackes of Cotten, which deuise was
giuen them by the <HI>Italians,</HI> that our Ordinaunce shoulde
not hurt their men.</P>
<P>Each of theyr boates or <HI>Paraos</HI> had two péeces of Or∣dinaunce
in them, and fiue and twentie men, of the which
there were fiue in euery <HI>Parao</HI> that had their Caléeuers, and
all the rest were bow men.</P>
<P>Also there were twentie of these Foysts, all cheined to∣gether,
<PB REF="144"/>
for to set vpon the Caruell. Also there were liii.
Catures, beside thirtie greate Barks, each of these hadde
his péece of Ordinaunce, and sixtéene men, which serued
in him with sundry kindes of weapons.</P>
<P>Besides all these armed vessells, there went other fur∣nished
with men, which béeing all together, it seemed that
the whole riuer was couered ouer, in the which Fléet were
well néere x. thousand men, and of this fléete was Adme∣rall
<HI>Nabeadarin,</HI> and for Vice Admerall the Lorde of <HI>Re∣pelyn.</HI>
Certeinly to see them altogether vpon the water and
lande, was a greate terrour, all of them béeing halfe na∣ked,
some of coulour blacke, and others of a darke Taw∣nye.
And vppon their weapons the Sunne did so glister,
that they appeared as though they had béene swoordes, and
newly ground, and so lykewise did their targets, the which
were of sundrie coulours, and shewed very gallant. And for
that our men should stand in the more feare of them, they
gaue out great cries and laroms. After this they beganne
to sound vppon their instrumentes of warre, which noyse
contynued alwayes, nowe after one sorte, and then after
another.</P>
<P>Our men bearing amongst such a multitude, and bée∣ing
in theyr Caruell and theyr boates, coulde scarcelye bée
discerned, for with the Fléete, they occupyed almost all the
passage, by meanes of ropes they gaue the one the other,
which ropes were wounde about with cheynes, that they
should not cut them a sunder. And after that they hadde
done this, commaundement was giuen, to giue fire to the
Ordinaunce, with the which the enimyes were recei∣ued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Naires of Coching do all run avvay▪</NOTE></P>
<P>At this instaunt those Nayres that were of <HI>Coching</HI>
did all runne awaye, onely <HI>Grandagora</HI> and <HI>Frangora</HI> re∣mained

woulde haue gone as the others did, which had bene no
matter, but that they should sée how valiantly our men de∣fended
themselues in the battell, into the which they went
in a great heate.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="144"/>
The Ordinaunce went off so often, and lykewise the
small shot, that there was none that coulde see one another,
for the smoake of the same. The Caruell and the Boates
did so flame in fire, and did so cruelly handle the enimyes
at the first entering, that there were torne in péeces some
of their <HI>Paraos,</HI> and manye of their men slaine and hurt,
without any of ours hurt, or standing in any daunger ther∣of
at all. By this time, the enimyes were come, within the
throwe of a Dart. Howbeit, as they were many, and that
without order, the one did hurt and hinder the other, so that
they could not fight. Yet notwithstanding, the xxv. <HI>Paraos</HI>
that went before, did trouble our men very much with
theyr Ordinaunce which they had, for that they went chei∣ned
together.</P>
<P>Our men being wearied and hurt, and the bat∣taile
hauing endured a good while, the Captaine Generall
commaunded a Saker to bee shotte at them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eni∣mies vtter¦ly discom¦fited, doe run their vvaye.</NOTE> the which till
that time had not béene shot at the enimies. And after that
the same was twice discharged, they all fledde, and for that
they laye very thicke together, it did immediatlye sinke
foure of them, and with that they were all ouercome, and
so they ran theyr waye. The residue of the <HI>Paraos</HI> which did
continue in the battaile, were eightéene sunke, and thir∣téene
fledde awaye, the residue gaue place, in the which
there were of the enimyes greate numbers slaine and
hurt.</P>
<P>After all this came the Vize Admerall called the Lord of
<HI>Repelyn,</HI> with another squadron, and gaue a proud onset,
so did the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> giue the lyke vpon the land.
This battaile was farre more vehement then the first,
in the which were manye more of the enimyes slaine,
then before, as appeared by the water which was of the
coulour of bloud. Yet for all this, the Lorde of <HI>Repelyn</HI>
made lowde outeryes, commaunding them to laye the Car∣uell
aboorde, but for all that they durst not venture to
doe it, but rather were desirous to goe theyr waye, as they
also that were a land did the like.</P>
<P><PB REF="145"/>
It was now at this present past Euensong, from the time
the battell did first beginne, in the which were of the eny∣mies
slaine, not onely by land, but also by water. 350. men,
which were knowne, besides others, the which were aboue
a thousand: and of our men there were some hurt, but none
slaine. And although theyr pellets were made of cast yron,
yet they did no more hurt, then a stone béeing throwne.
Howbeit, our defences were all torne in péeces, and one of
our boates also, neuerthelesse, not in such sorte, but that it
might bée new rigged before that it was night.</P>

make no more wars against our men, more thē that which
was past alreadie.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="145"/>
And vpon this condition, they returned to the king of <HI>Co∣ching,</HI>
with whom they reconcyled themselues, and those
that did thus were, one called <HI>Marugata, Muta Caymal,</HI>
and his brother, and Cousins, who immediatly after the
battaile, did so secretly depart from the kinge of <HI>Calicuts</HI>
Campe, from whence they went to the Iland of <HI>Vaypin,</HI>
to stay there, till they might see their time, as I haue sayd.
But when the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> had knowledge that they
were gone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Calicut much bla¦meth his captaines for being ouer∣throvvne by so fevv▪</NOTE> and also vnderstoode where they were become,
he was very sory therefore, which also was the occasion
that he renewed all his griefe, that hee had conceyued for
his ouerthrow, which he had receyued at our mens hands,
that were so few. Wherupon he tooke occasion to rebuke
his captaines, saying, that they were good for nothing, and
that through their defaulte our men continued and kept
these passages. And if so he, that they had had any shame,
they would or this time haue dryuen them from thence, in
especially hauing geuen so often the enterprise to passe the
same. Then those two Italians that were presente, did
replie vnto the king, that although our men had done most
valiantly, yet that which they did was like vnto the dedes
of desperate men. Notwithstanding, that they were not a∣ble
to defende themselues long, from such a power as his
was, in especially, not hoping to haue any succour. And
therefore they willed him to set vpon them often times,
for by that meanes it was possible to take them. Some
also of those kinges and noble men that came to succoure
the king, and that were desirous of warres, did confirme
that which the Italians had saide before, addinge moreo∣uer,
that God doth permitte his enemies sometime to haue
the victorie, for a more greater losse vnto them, and there∣fore
it were good saide they, that he followed his friends
counsell, and prooued their stedfastnesse. And although it
were so, that he had not the victorie immediatelye, yet hee
should not therefore dispaire. The king finding himselfe
somewhat vexed in minde with those wordes, aunswered
them saying. Although that eche of you is so valiant, that
<PB REF="146"/>
it appeareth vnto you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the kings aunsvvere vnto this aduice.</NOTE> a small matter to ouercome those
Christians, yet I am not so obstinate to thinke the same.
Howbeit I suppose yet, that you doe sée in me no such a
feare, <Q>that thereby you might iudge it néedefull, to streng∣then
me with those words. For what can you tell me in
this case, that you may satisfie me withall? For if so bee,
that you will consider as much as I doe, you would soone
know, how great an acte this is, that you doe make so lit∣tle
accompt off. I doe not take it in vs for so great a victo∣rie
in ouercomming these Christians, but rather in them,
in defending themselues from vs, as they haue done. Wher
in it hath well appeared,</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">No doubt but God doeth fight for his ser∣uants▪</NOTE> that their God did fight for them.</P>
<P>And will you sée how it is so? You maye well
consider, that our men are many, and that they haue bene
valyant in the warres past, it hath well appeared in many
and great battailes, wherein I haue ouercome mine eni∣mies,
<Q>as you do all well know. But since they haue fought
with these Christians, they séeme to be (not as they were)
nor durst giue the onset vpon them, for the feare they haue
conceiued. And certainly, as farre as I can learne, and al∣so
all those that are of a good iudgement, we ought to be∣léeue,
that those workes are rather of God, then of man.
For who is he that would not be afeard of them, wel per∣ceiuing
that all others are? I meane not onely the King
of <HI>Cochings</HI> subiects which came to succour vs, who haue
repented themselues thereof, but also manye other of our
friends, which in the beginning of these wars did also aide
vs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And farther, I am enformed by some, that they haue
now offered their friendship vnto the King of <HI>Coching.</HI>
Which thing, if it be true, it is for that they haue lost the
hope they had of any victory on our part, as well for that
which is past, as also reputing how lyttle time there is
now lefte of the Summer, and also for that in the Win∣ter
they cannot remayne anye time to continue in the
Fieldes, because of the great stormes and raine, which
would then be.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="146"/>
<Q>And in the ende of the winter, then will there come the
Fléete from <HI>Portingale,</HI> which will doe vs as much harme
as the fléete did the last yere, and so I shall neuer bée out of
vnfortunate mischiefes, but thus in the end I shall be vt∣terly
destroyed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All this shall be that I shall gette, with the
losse of the friendship of the Christians. And it is possible
that for theyr causes the Pagodes will not aide nor helpe
me as they haue done before time. For although you tell
me,</Q> that they doe permit sometime their friendes to suffer
persecution for their profit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God cha∣sticeth mē sometime for theyr trial som∣time for their of∣fences.</NOTE> do you not thinke the same also
to happen for their offences, as it is well knowne this

<P>For this talke of the kings, they were all sorrie that had
giuen him counsell to go forward in these wars, since that
they perceiued that his intent was to leaue the same, and
haue friendship with the Captaine Generall. These there∣fore
would forthwith haue aunswered, but the Prince <HI>Na∣beadarin</HI>
didde preuent them, who was sorrie for these

<P>SInce the king doth aske vs counsell what is best to be
done in this matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prin∣ces Orati∣on vnto the King &amp; Nobles assembled▪</NOTE> which standeth him so much vp∣pon,

<PB REF="147"/>
will commaund vs to doe that which they will haue vs,
so we ought to vnderstande them, although therefore in
these warres it appeareth that it goeth very euill with vs,
and in this they doe shew how much they are our frends,
truely I doe beleue the same, the rather for that we ought
not to beleue them that would haue a matter done with∣out
reason, as it were to geue vs the victorie against those
Christians, and power to destroy the king of <HI>Coching,</HI> vn∣to
whom we haue done very much hurt, killynge the laste
yeare his Princes and almost all his men, setting of <HI>Co∣ching</HI>
a fire, and destroying his countrey, from whence
we hunted him away, with his great discredite, dispossed
him of his kingdome &amp; subiects, so that al they for the feare
they had of vs did leaue him, yea his own frendes forsooke
him, &amp; went against him, &amp; all for our sake. And aboue all
these euils the which he did not deserue, for y<SUP>t</SUP> he was not in
any fault, we would yet procéed further, vtterly to destroy
him. What hath he done? Did hee procure to take anye
mans countrey from him? No. In friendship did he vse
himselfe traiterously? Neither. Did he commaunde the
Marchantes that they should not come to <HI>Calicut?</HI> Neither,
Did he thē some worse thing since he did nothing of these?
Nothing at all. What then? forsooth for y<SUP>t</SUP> he did receiue into
his countrey the Christians which being driuen out of <HI>Ca∣licut,</HI>
went to séeke him out, as he was desirous to encrease
and enpeople his Citie, and to augment hys estate and ri∣ches:
Shall we therefore destroy him being our friend, as
an enemie? With this right doe the Pagodes helpe vs to
take the honor, riches and credite from the right owner? It
cannot be so, for that they be righteous and iust, and ther∣fore
they will not help vs agaynst those Christians which
were slayne, robbed, and thrust out of <HI>Calicut,</HI> and were
there receiued vnder safeconduct from the king, comminge
to his porte before any others, and not geuing cause wher∣fore
they should receiue so many iniuries. If wee doe it
for that they laide hande vpon a Shippe of the Moores,
there is no reason why, for that the Kinge commaunded
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
them to stay the same: And if he had ben aduised by al men
as he was by me, the Moores should haue paid for that they
ha done &amp; that very well, for &amp; if they had ben punished, it
wold wel haue appered, y<SUP>t</SUP> the king had ben in no fault of y<SUP>t</SUP>
which they had done. And this had bene sufficient to haue
confirmed the friendship of the Christians with him, &amp; this
also would haue bene a cause sufficient, to haue kept them
in <HI>Calicut</HI> from going to <HI>Coching,</HI> to haue there setteled a
trade, whom the King through euill councell hath trauay∣led
so much to take them, as though they were théeues that
had robbed him of his owne, they being so good, so gentle,
so valyant as we sée,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amongst other ver¦tues grate fulnes cō∣mended.</NOTE> and besides so gratefull of the bene∣fite
they doe receiue. For the receiuing of them as y<SUP>e</SUP> King
of <HI>Mylinde</HI> did, they gaue ouer two ships laden with gold,
the which they had taken from a Cousin of his. If these
men were Théeues, as the Moores doe say they are, those
were prices not to be left. You know how rich a Present
they brought to the King, and what ritch merchandise they
brought, and how much golde and siluer. Those fishermen
which they did carrie away naked, did retourne againe all
apparailed. If then we were friends, how surely should we
liue: &amp; what profit should the King haue, if we had amitie
with them. I do not speak of y<SUP>e</SUP> ship y<SUP>t</SUP> carried y<SUP>•</SUP> Elephants
which was giuen him: when all y<SUP>•</SUP> prises did passe by these
théeues hands, the which they left. These were seruices to
be thankfully receiued, giuing occasion to vs to gratifie thē
in like sort, and to be glad to haue them for our friends, &amp;
since we did put them awaye when they had néede of vs,
now that we haue néede of them, let it not be thought euil,
to conclude a peace with them, for that the wars we make
against them, we make the same against our selues. They
are vpon the Sea of more power then we are, as you may
well sée the same by the long time they haue defended this
passage, and with what power of men, and also what de∣struction
they haue brought vppon vs, and are like to doe,
since that our Countrey lyeth néere to the water side, and
that with our owne losse, we haue well séene the truth.
<PB REF="148"/>
Therfore let it go no further, but let vs séeke some remedie
to haue a peace concluded amongst vs: for if we haue not, y<SUP>e</SUP>
port or harbour of <HI>Calicut</HI> wil be vtterly vndone, &amp; the king

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He King of <HI>Coching</HI> being departed, the

which he feared very much: and
being desirous to suppe with his men, thether came <HI>Loren∣so

accustomed to come, for (as I haue said) there was neuer
any found in the battel of our men, that the enimies could
ouercome: The Supper being done, they went to rest

by the Vicar, the Captaine generall said vnto them.</P>
<P>MAsters and my friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cap∣tain gene¦rals Orati¦on to his company▪</NOTE> I am very merie &amp; glad that

God will haue vs in his high &amp; glorious memorie,
to giue vs the victory against our enimies, not onely for
the satisfaction of our troubles,<Q> but also for the increasing
of his holy and Catholike faith and that the King of <HI>Co∣ching</HI>
and his people might vnderstand, that our God is a
true God, and mightie aboue all mighties, and that hée
doeth not fayle those which doe put theyr confidence and
trust in his name. As for the King of <HI>Coching,</HI>
you did well sée him yesterdaye howe sadde and heauie</Q>
<PB REF="151"/>
<Q>and without hope he went away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the victo∣ry,
which God I doubt not hath promised vs, making sure
account, that we were all lost, and vtterly cast awaye, per∣swading
me withall▪ that I shuld in time prouide for mine
owne safetie. Surely I did neuer finde in him so much
feare, nor yet so great cowardnesse, the occasion therof was,
that they heard that the power of the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> was
much greater then it was before. And although it were so
great as they doe thinke, yet farre greater without al com∣parison
is our God, and that haue you well seene in the
helps past that he hath sent vs, and euen so now do I hope
that he will likewise helpe vs and send vs the victory.
And with this hope let vs assuredly trust to ouercome the
enimyes, for he will maintaine the honour that wée haue
gotten, and from hence forth will so encrease the same, that
we should remaine in this worlde for lightes of valiaunt
men, and for the same be so feared in the <HI>Indias,</HI> that nei∣ther
the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> nor any else will dare set vpon vs:
and the honour being gotten, we shall be assured of rest for
the troubles we haue had.</Q></P>
<P>As he had ended they sayd all, that without the victorye
they would not liue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mē make warres to the intēt to liue in peace.</NOTE> And at this time which was two
houres after midnight, some of the Ordinaunce of the fléete
of the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> beganne to discharge, making theyr
way towards the Captaine Generall: and the king him∣selfe
went by land, being accompanied with more then thir∣tie
thousand men, with his field péeces, as his vse was, and
with great hope y<SUP>e</SUP> he should giue vs the ouerthrow, &amp; with
this double pride, much more then he euer had, he came for∣ward.
The Lord of <HI>Repelyn</HI> marched before with certeine
men that should make rampyres of earth in the point of
<HI>Arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l,</HI> for a defence for our enimyes in the battell.
He brought with him great noises &amp; cries, with great plea∣sure
and dauncing, the which the Captaine generall didde
heare, and went verie secretly a lande, and placed himselfe
in the very point where the enimies shuld come, the which
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
he did defend that the enimies should not make there any
rampyers, about the which our men killed some of them.
This being knowne to the king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> that the Cap∣taine
Generall came thether to méete with him, hée com∣maunded
his souldiers with a stout stomacke to set vppon
him and take him aliue, the better to reuenge himselfe on
him at his pleasure. About this there was a great skirmish
and many of the enimies were slaine without taking of
the Captaine Generall, neither yet could they make theyr
rampiers. As the morning came on which was the Ascen∣tion
day, the other Fléete did appeare, y<SUP>•</SUP> which was not far
off, and by this, the Captaine generall was retired vnto his
boates, but it was with great trouble, because of the great
multitude of the enimies which came vpon him: howbeit
he imbarked both himselfe and his men without lacking a∣ny
of them, but there were of the enimies many slaine and
hurt. The point béeing now cléere &amp; vnfurnished, the eni∣mies
came and placed themselues there, and then they be∣gan
to shoote off their Ordinaunce at vs, to the which wée
did aunswere with ours, dooing them great hurt therewith,
for that all our shot went amongst the enimies, where they
lay open, and our men were well fenced, therefore their or∣dinaunce
could doe vs no hurt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Cali∣cut being in danger sendeth for succor to y<SUP>e</SUP> rest of his fleete.</NOTE> The king of <HI>Calicut</HI> séeing
this, sent word to his Fléete that they should rowe a pace,
and come to helpe and deliuer him from the daunger and
feare that our men did put him in. The Fléete being come,
it was a fearefull sight to beholde them, for that there was
driuen before them certeine raffes, the which went alwaies
burning, with intent to set the Caruells on fire, and after
them an hundred and ten <HI>Paraos</HI> full of men &amp; ordinance, &amp;
many of them cheined together, and after them a hundred
<HI>Catures</HI> in the same manner, and foure score <HI>Tonis de cox∣ia
ancha,</HI> and in each of them thirtie men, besides theyr or∣dinaunce,
and the eight castles in kéeping of these, the which
stoode hard by the point, for that the ebbe was not as yet
altogether entered. The enimies came with great clamor,
making great laromes and cries, and plaieng vpon instru∣ments,
<PB REF="152"/>
accounting vs as ouercome already, and with this,
they shot off so many péeces of Ordinance as it was won∣derfull
to see, and with their fagots which they brought be∣fore
them burning, they drew very neere to the <HI>Canizo,</HI>
which was placed before the Caruells, and therefore they
could not come to set the Caruels a fire, neither any other
of all the Fléete. Wherefore, all those that went before, did
ioyne with the <HI>Caniz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and therewith did giue vs battaile,
&amp; without all doubt they had closed with vs at this time,
if this defence had not bene. In this sodaine fight which
was very great, the battel indured a good while, vntill such
time the ebbe came on, and at this time the enimies recei∣ued
great hurt, not onely in their <HI>Fregates</HI> that were torne
in péeces and sunke, but also many of their men that were
slaine and hurte. The Ebbe being come, the <HI>Paraos</HI> with
their Castles did put off from the poynt, and to the ende
they should goe the swifter, they were rowed with boats.
These came right towards the Caruells, and in the grea∣test
of them all went fortie fighting men, and in the other
of the middle sort in each of them fine and thirtie, and in
the lesser sort thirtie men. All these were bowmen &amp; shot,
and besides that they did carrie Ordinaunce, and stoode all
abroad, which did shewe so terrible and monstrous a front,
as was fearful to be séene, the rather being so great a fléet,
in comparison of our small power to defend them, we ha∣uing
but two Caruells &amp; two boats▪ But this was y<SUP>e</SUP> day
wherein God did well shew, the great regard he had to pre∣serue
vs, for that neither the sight of so many men, and so
many sorts of wayes whereby they had compassed and be∣set
vs, neither yet such a Fléete, that was so great and
mightye, with the fearefull cryes that the Enimies did
make, nor the terrible thundering of the Ordinance, could
any wayes discourage or make vs afeard. The greater of
the Castles being come hard to this defence, did then shoote
off all his ordinance at the Caruels, &amp; the Captaine gene∣rall
commaunded to shoote at the same with a Saker, the
which caused the said Castle to stand wauering, but yet did
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
them little harme, neither yet with another péece that they
shot off foorthwith, with the which Captaine generall was
so sad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prai∣er of a di∣stressed minde in the bitter¦nesse of heart.</NOTE> that he lifted vp his eyes vnto heauen, saieng: Lord,
doe not retourne my sinnes to my face at this time, and
this he said with such a loude voyce, that some there were
that heard the same. In the meane while came the other
<HI>Paraos,</HI> which did set themselues right equal with the first,
&amp; with the comming of these, the battell did increase more
and more very stoutly on all parts. Their arrowes came
so thicke, which made so great a shadow, that sometimes
ther appeared neither heauen nor earth, with y<SUP>•</SUP> great smoke
of their Ordinaunce. The Captaine generall did tourne,
and commaund to shoote at the great Castle the Saker a∣gaine,
&amp; as with y<SUP>•</SUP> other shot past, they had somwhat shaken
their yron works which were not very strong, so with the
same shot they presently brake, &amp; after y<SUP>t</SUP> the yron workes
were thus broken, some of their beams being likewise cari∣ed
away, with certeine of their men slaine, with y<SUP>•</SUP> same our
men gaue a great cry, &amp; the Captaine general falling down
on his knées, gaue God great thankes, &amp; returning to shoot
the Saker againe, did carrie away another row of beams,
with many more slaine and hurt, and the Ordinaunce be∣ing
shotte off againe, it was all torne in péeces in a small
space, and so the enimies went with their Castle further of,
but the others remayned there fighting very stoutly. And
after this, both parts endured more trouble all the day fo∣lowing,
then in all the battells that were past: but in the
ende, we did so much hurt vnto their Castles, and sunke and
rent so many of their <HI>Paraos</HI> in péeces, y<SUP>•</SUP> the enimies could
not abide the same, &amp; therfore they shrank thence. The fight
did endure till euensong time, &amp; began in y<SUP>•</SUP> morning: of the
enimies wer many slain, as afterward was séene in y<SUP>•</SUP> wa∣ter,
&amp; of vs none, nor any hurt, but only brused with a shot
which went through y<SUP>e</SUP> Admiral, y<SUP>e</SUP> bullet went among ma∣ny
that were there, but they receiued no harme.</P>
<P>The Captaine generall séeing the enimies went their
waye, followed them in their Boates, and such <HI>Paraos</HI>
<PB REF="153"/>
as he had, shooting alwayes at those that were vppon the
point <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aul,</HI> with the king, and with the force of their
Ordinaunce made them runne away, leauing behinde them
slaine thrée hundred and thirtie men. This béeing done, he
then returned to his Caruells, where that euening came to
visit him the Prince of <HI>Coching</HI> in the behalfe of the king,
who sent to excuse himselfe that he could not come to visit
him in his owne person. But he sent him againe word, that
he wold receiue no discharge, vntill such time he knew his
heuines was past, but praied him frō hence forth to beléeue
better in God, for that the daungerous daye of the Castles
was past, and he remained in the passage as he did before,
all safe, and in readinesse to serue him. The selfe same daie
came to visit him certeine noble men, of those that were of
the king of <HI>Cochings</HI> side, with whome there was made
great triumph for this victorie: and likewise there went to
sée him many Moores Merchants which brought him great
presents, supposing to get of him thereby great friendship.
He receiued them very gently, praieng them to be true sub∣iects
to the king of <HI>Coching,</HI> for thereby they should finde
him assured at any time whensoeuer he might stand them
in any stéede, wherevpon they faithfully promised so to do,
&amp; to binde them the more, he made them very great chéere.
Also the next day in the morning the king of <HI>Coching</HI> came
to visit him, who imbraced him with as great gladnesse as
could be deuised, saieng that he did wel performe y<SUP>e</SUP> which
he had promised, in giuing the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> the ouer∣throwe.
But vnto this he answered, that he had not perfor∣med
all his promise, since that he did not put him on the
<HI>Caluete,</HI> but he was not in fault thereof, for that the king
kept himselfe alwayes farre from him. He declared also to
the king diuerse other matters of pleasure, which the king
answered in like manner, praising very much his valiant∣nes,
&amp; that he had wel séene y<SUP>e</SUP> God did fight for vs, asking of
him forgiuenesse for y<SUP>e</SUP> distrust he had in him, &amp; how great∣ly
he was bound to succour him, declaring also that the af∣faires
of <HI>Portingale</HI> were very great, and confessing lyke∣wise
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
that he through his worthinesse had made him king.
After this victorie the inhabitants of <HI>Coching</HI> did cast off
the feare they had of the king of <HI>Calycut,</HI> in such sort, that
neuer from thence forth they stoode in anye dread of him,
neither yet made account of his habilitye.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE king remained greatly ashamed and
very sad, for that at the same time he could
not ouerthrowe the Captaine Generall,
the rather because he neuer accounted any
thing more certeine, then to ouer come
him in that conflict, because of the Castles
which he had prepared for his confusion. And now leauing
a side all hope euer to haue the victorie, he desired to haue
with vs no more warres, and therefore he called before him
into his tents, all those kings and noble men that came to
helpe him, and sayd thus vnto them.</P>
<P>YOV doe well sée how little our power profiteth vs a∣gainst
these men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Cali∣cuts orati¦on vnto his noble men.</NOTE> and how little our pollicies preuaileth
since they doe not regard vs, and would neuer giue ouer the
passage, notwithstanding the greate power we had against
them. The like account also they make of vs in their feasts,
and pastimes when we goe against them, <Q>as though wee
were the fewer, and they the more, and as though the land
which they are in were theirs, &amp; we were the Christians,
whereby it appeareth, they alwayes make account of the
victorie for certeine, which either they obteine by witch∣crafts,
or else their God doth fight for them, which cannot
bée otherwise, considering the great victories they haue had
<PB REF="154"/>
against vs, and the greate hurt that we haue receiued of
them. Wherefore I suppose that God would it should be so,
for the litle iustice y<SUP>t</SUP> is obserued in these wars, as hath wel
appered in the beginning of the same. And if I had ben wel
aduised, it shuld not haue gone so farre forward, but in the
end I am in the fault, and not they, and since it is so, wée
haue therin no right cause, neither canne gette any thing
by our strength. Let vs therfore giue it ouer, &amp; desire no more
to haue <HI>Coching,</HI> for that God doth fauour these men, since
wel you sée, there is no power in the <HI>Indias</HI> that can offend
vs so long, we being so strong, but these dogs, of whom I
am afraid, y<SUP>t</SUP> they will subdue the <HI>Indias,</HI> according to the
acts that they haue done, and the credit that they haue got∣ten,
especially in <HI>Malabar.</HI> And that this mishap may go no
further, I thinke it shoulde be conuenient to procure theyr
friendship, &amp; also it is time to get vs away, for y<SUP>•</SUP> the winter
commeth on, &amp; the riuers do increase, &amp; these men do ouer∣run
all: and this is certeine, y<SUP>e</SUP> if the wars indure, they will
come hether &amp; inforce vs to depart with our losse &amp; disho∣nor.</Q>
Now y<SUP>•</SUP> first that he asked councell of what was neces∣sary
to be done, was his brother <HI>Nabeadarin,</HI> who being an∣gry
with the king that he wold neuer follow his councel, &amp;
leaue the warres, saide: that now he knewe to his cost
what he had told him of vs: &amp; since in time he woulde not
know it, he asked him what it shuld now profit him for his
honour and credit, since y<SUP>•</SUP> then when opportunitie serued he
refused his councell, but now he willed him to do what he
shuld thinke good, for he could not do amisse. The king bée∣ing
somwhat broken of his pride, (calling him brother) said
that now there was no time to aunswere him after such
sort, but to tell him his opinion what he thought best. The
prince answered y<SUP>•</SUP> we were venterous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The coun¦sell that the king of Cali∣cuts bro¦ther gaue him touch¦ing the making of peace with the captaine generall.</NOTE> &amp; alwaies remained
so assured of the victory, vpon our experienced strength and
good fortune, albeit our power were much lesse, so y<SUP>e</SUP> he great∣ly
doubted we would none of his friendship. And for thée to
offer y<SUP>e</SUP> same, said he to y<SUP>e</SUP> king, &amp; they to refuse it, wold be no
lesse dishonor vnto thée, then the often ouerthrows y<SUP>•</SUP> thou
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
hast receiued. And since by thy profered friendship, we can∣not
get so much as we should loose if they refuse y<SUP>•</SUP> same, it
were best therefore not to procure it, but to defer it, &amp; make
peace with the Captaine general that commeth y<SUP>•</SUP> next yere
from <HI>Portingale,</HI> who considering howe little the wars
will profit him, <Q>&amp; not being assured of good successe therein,
will be the gladder to make peace with thée, &amp; therfore that
it may not be thought that we run awaye for feare, let vs
stay &amp; not depart, vntill such time it shuld be thought, that y<SUP>e</SUP>
necessitie of the winter did inforce vs hence, &amp; then may we
wel talke of peace, when possible the Captaine general wil
willingly accept the same, doubting that his good fortune
may chaunge. And to prouoke &amp; giue occasion the rather to
haue his friendship, let vs giue him no more battels in the
meane time, since it serueth to no purpose, but to the great
losse and confusion of our men.</Q></P>
<P>This councell of <HI>Nabeadarin</HI> was reproued by the
kings and noble men which were there then assembled, &amp;
especially of the Lord of <HI>Repelyn,</HI> which said that the king
ought not to goe away, neither for the greatnesse of the
winter that should come, nor yet for the iosse of his men,
but rather to continue, giuing vs manye battailes, vntill
such time he did take vs, and not onely procured the de∣struction
of vs in <HI>Coching,</HI> but also of those that were in
<HI>Cananor</HI> and <HI>Coulan.</HI> And that immediatly it were expedi∣ent
they sent men of credit with letters to affirme, that they
had boorded our Caruells with their Castles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A subtile deuice by meanes of a lye to haue brought our mē to destructiō but it toke no effect▪</NOTE> and had also
slaine vs all, and taken our sayd Caruells, and therefore
that they should kill all those that were there, as they had
promised. To the same effect therefore the king did write
immediatly and the Moores also, but there was no credite
giuen to the same, for that there was other newes sent
before, and therefore the last was taken for false. Neuer∣thelesse
for all that, by the industry of the Moores the which
did dwel in those two towns, our men were in great dan∣ger,
and durst not come out of theyr Factoryes, and in
<HI>Coulan</HI> there was one slaine, but in the other places none,
<PB REF="155"/>
for afterward messengers were sent from <HI>Calycut</HI> to the
Gentiles, that our men were aliue, and what wée had done.
For which cause the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> was aunswered that
they would not kill our men, vntill such time the Captaine
Generall was taken, and that he had first giuen him the
ouerthrowe, which béeing done, they would conclude with
him. This béeing come to the knowledge of the Lorde of
<HI>Repelyn,</HI> both he and the Moores did perswade the king
to fight another battell with the Captaine Generall, the
which he would willingly not haue done, for that he was
wearyed in his spirit, but he could not withstand them, and
therefore commaunded the same to bée giuen both by Sea
and lande. But in it he had lyke successe as before, so that
more through the importunate desire of the Moores then of
his owne will, he gaue in his owne person another battell
with his Castles, with many more men and vessells then
in the other before. This battell endured longer then the
other, in which also the enimyes were ouercome, and re∣ceiued
farre greater losse then euer they did before. With
this victorye that we had gotten, the inhabitaunts of <HI>Co∣ching</HI>
remained sure from all their enimies, and so likewise
did the king, whom afterward came to visite the Captaine
generall, being brought in a chaire, with farre greater estate
then euer he came before, since the first beginning of all the
warres. This being knowne in the campe of the enimies,
the kings and noble men that were with the king of <HI>Cali∣cut,</HI>
tooke occasion to say vnto him that he shoulde not con∣sent,
in especially hauing such a greate power as he hadde
there present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An aun∣svvere vvhich y<SUP>e</SUP> king of Calicut made vn∣to certein noble mē▪</NOTE> that the king of <HI>Coching</HI> should haue him in
so small reputation, as thereby to iudge himselfe frée from
him, &amp; out of his danger. To the which the king of <HI>Calicut</HI>
made answere, y<SUP>e</SUP> the king of <HI>Coching</HI> had great reson to do
that which he had done, in especially knowing his greate
power and camp, and yet perceiuing that he could not giue
him the ouerthrowe. And since that his euill fortune was
such, he desired them not to wish him to go forward in these
wars, for that he knewe well and was fully perswa∣ded,
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
that continuing the same, he shoulde alwayes receiue
the losse, and run daily into greater danger, as by the feare
thereof it was apparaunt. And therefore he requested them
all to let him alone by himselfe, who so béeing, did imagine
againe what course he might best take to reuenge him∣selfe.</P>
<P>And after that he came aboord, he called for certeine of his
Nayres, in whom he had reposed all his trust, commanding
them to go to <HI>Coching</HI> with some dissimulation, and there
to trauaile all that they could to kill the Captaine general,
and all such of our men as they could méete withall. And
as the Naires are men inconstant, and cannot kéepe counsel
longer then they are bethinking themselues therof, therfore
immediatly their intent was knowne to the Captaine ge∣neral,
who from thence forward had a better regard to him∣selfe,
and vnto the rest of his companye then he had before.
And the better to take those Naires which came as Spyes
thether, he appointed thervnto two companies of y<SUP>•</SUP> Naires
of <HI>Coching,</HI> commaunding the one to k▪pe dilligentlye a
long the foord, and the other a long the riuer, who watched
by quarters both by day and night. Whilest this dilligence
was vsed, the Captaine Generall had knowledge that this
spy was a Naire of <HI>Coching,</HI> and of the house or stocke of
the <HI>Leeros,</HI> who had attendant vppon him certeine Nayres
that were straungers, which appeared to bée lyke those of
<HI>Calicut.</HI></P>
<P>Nowe hauing certeine knowledge héereof, he so hande
the matter, and in such order, that forthwith hée tooke
them all prisoners, and béeing brought before him, he com∣maunded
them to bée cruellye whipped in the presence of
those Naires of <HI>Coching,</HI> and afterwarde to bée hanged.
The inhabitauntes of <HI>Coching</HI> séeing this, requested the
Captaine Generall to giue them some other punishment
since that they were Nayres, and not to shewe them so
great extremitie, but notwithstanding hée wold not graunt
vnto anye other punishment, for that they had deserued
the same.</P>
<P><PB REF="156"/>
Then all his Captaines sayde vnto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Orati¦on of cer∣teine cap∣tains vnto their gene¦rall for his better ad¦uise in ad¦ministrati¦on of iu∣stice.</NOTE> that first and
before all he should call to remembraunce, the greate trou∣bles
that the King of <HI>Coching</HI> hadde susteined for the one∣lye
mainteining of them, and also howe much it woulde
grieue him to heare saye, that such were hanged in his
Countrie without his consent.</P>
<P>Also it woulde giue an occasion for such noble men as
were with him, to saye that he is a king but for a while,
since that his iurisdiction is nowe taken from him.
And forasmuch as hetherto he had vsed him alwayes with
reuerence, they wished that nowe at the ende he woulde
haue him in a greater estimation then euer hée hadde be∣fore.</P>
<P>The Captaine Generall hauing considered theyr rea∣sons,
did allowe of theyr good councell héerein, and cau∣sed
those Naires to be sent for, that were gone to execu∣tion,
of the which there were two halfe dead, but those
that were liuing hée sent to the king of <HI>Coching,</HI> aduerti∣sing
him how that they hadde deserued death, and also the
cause why hée hadde not commaunded them to bée han∣ged.</P>
<P>The King hearing this, tooke the same in greate ho∣nour
and estimation, that they were sent him, and espe∣ciall
for that there were present sundrye of the noble men
of his Countrie, and of other places, yea, and Moores al∣so,
of the chiefest that dwelt in <HI>Coching,</HI> which did not
lette to saye vnto the king to afrunt him withall, that
our men were they that commaunded and did not obeye.</P>
<P>But from hence foorthe the Captaine Generall
hadde such intelligence, that the subtile
dealinges of the king of <HI>Ca∣lycut,</HI>

<HEAD>How the king of Calicut of pure heauinesse for the ill
successe he had in the warres, did put him∣selfe
into a Torcull, and within a small time
after came foorth therof. chap. 73.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Vne béeing now ended, and the winter be∣ginning
to increase, the Captaine generall
thought that it woulde be some cause that
the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> would not tarrie there
long. And therfore he was fully minded to
set vpon him at the remouing of his camp,
for that by experience he knew the small valour of his eni∣mies,
by such victories as he had gotten in times past, which
did therefore animate him the more therevnto, thinking
that at such a time he might doe him much harme. And be∣ing
in a readinesse to vncheine his Mastes, he was present∣ly
informed that the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> was reforming a new
his Castles, and preparing in a readinesse a greater Fléete
then euer he had before, that hée might giue him there∣with
once more the battaile.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A false ala∣rome giuē forth by y<SUP>e</SUP> Calicuti∣ans to ter∣rifie the Portin∣gals vvith all.</NOTE> This was but a fléeing
newes that was commaunded to be giuen out by the
king of <HI>Calycut,</HI> who did surmise that at the raising of
his Campe, which hée was minded to doe, and to goe
his waye, the Captaine Generall woulde sette vppon
him.</P>
<P>And therefore hée determined, that his departure should
be so secretlye done, that no man shoulde knowe there∣of
but onelye <HI>Nabeadarin.</HI> For this cause therefore
he gaue out, that hée woulde giue the battaile in the pas∣sage
of <HI>Palurte,</HI> and also in the Foorde both together, to
the ende the Captaine Generall might occupie himselfe
in defending them both, and hée himselfe the better
steale awaye, as hée didde: but hée gotte nothing there∣by,
more then hée hadde gotten before.</P>
<P><PB REF="157"/>
After all this, on Saterday in the Euening, which was
Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> euen, on which day they gaue out, that they
would giue the battaile, there appeared the whole army of
the enimyes as they were accustomed to shew themselues.
The Captaine Generall hoping of theyr comming, did tar∣rye
there all that night, but in the morning he saw no like∣lyhood
thereof, and meruailing what that shoulde meane,
was informed by two <HI>Bramenes</HI> that the king of <HI>Calycut</HI>
was gone with his whole power vnto <HI>Repelyn,</HI> and that
at that present hée was there.</P>
<P>For this newes hée was very sorrie, but yet for all that
hée entered that present daye into <HI>Repelyn,</HI> where hée
fought with many of his enimyes, slewe and hurt a greate
number, and so returned to the passage, where he remained
yet certeine dayes to ensure <HI>Coching</HI> the better, which
was yet afeard of the King of <HI>Calycuts</HI> returning, fearing
that he would not leaue this passage. Howbeit the Cap∣taine
Generall was well assured that he would not come
there, by reason hée was fallen into such reproch and shame,
in the sight of all men, because of his great losses. So that
immediatly after that he had past the riuers of <HI>Repelyn,</HI> he
apparted himselfe with his noble men which had accom∣panied
him in these warres, and said vnto them with wée∣ping
eyes in this manner following.</P>
<P>FOR a man that is without shame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the kings Oration, made to such prin¦ces &amp; no∣ble mē as came to aide him in these vvarres.</NOTE> as I am, it is not
much to shedde these teares as I doe, the heauinesse of
my losse béeing such, as fetcheth the same from my hearte,
with the which I am so troubled, that since it is so, that I
cannot doe it in publike forte, I will goe into some place
where I may do the same without any body that may sée
mée. I haue also another griefe which troubleth mée ve∣rye
sore, ouer and besides my dishonour, which is, for
<Q>that I am not able to rewarde you for all the greate
good will and seruice you haue done mee in these warres,
the which I take for so greate a duetye, that if so be that
I might sée my selfe discharged of the same, I should bée
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
better contented, then with the getting of <HI>Coching.</HI> But
since it is not Gods pleasure that I shoulde get the victo∣rie
ouer it, which hath procured my dishonour, so is it not
his pleasure and will that I possesse the state of a king a∣ny
longer, but rather for the amending of my sinnes will
ende my lyfe in this Torcull,</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Torcull is as much as vvith vs an hermi∣tage, or such lyke pore kind of solitary relgious place▪</NOTE> where I meane to continue
vntill such time that God hath taken awaye this hatred,
which hée hath conceiued against mée. And from this time
forward you may dispose of your selues, and do what you
shall thinke best with my countrie and subiectes. I doe not
offer you my person, forsomuch as béeing a man so vnfor∣tunate
as I am, it shall not stand with your credite to re∣quire
his companye, and with this speach hée ended his
talke.</P>
<P>But the Princes and Noble men woulde somewhat
haue comforted him, and withdrawne him from this his
determination, but it could not preuaile, for that he had ful∣ly
bent himselfe to the contrary, and so with certeine of his
Chaplaines he entered into this Torcull.</P>
<P>Now his mother hauing knowledge that he was there,
shée sent him word, that for this his sodeine determinati∣on
she remained as heauie and with as sorrowfull a heart
as might bée.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mo∣thers mes¦sage to y<SUP>e</SUP> King of Calycut, being in the Tor∣cull.</NOTE> Informing him moreouer, that through this

for that from thence are gone and now are ready to go
many &amp; sundrie merchants, and also that the citie is become
wonderfully vnprouided of victualls, with the greate feare
the inhabitants are in of the Christians: which is the occa∣sion
ther are no victualls brought thether. But no perswa∣sion
she sayd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wher cre¦dit is im∣paired, it is better to lurke then to runne a∣broad vvith dis∣honour.</NOTE> could withdrawe him from these wars with
the Christians, which from the beginning of the same was
a great griefe vnto her: willing him also that in no case he
shoulde returne vnto <HI>Calycut,</HI> vntill he might doe the same
with his credit, which was cleane lost alreadie. And there∣fore
shée counsailed him a while to forbeare, vntill such
time he did recouer it againe, and that with victorie, yea, &amp;
rather to loose all then to returne without it.

With this message the Kings heauinesse increased great∣lye,
and he sent immediatelye for his Brother, to whome

lately they had departed from <HI>Portingale,</HI> for which cause
it was requisite that they were circumspect and diligent, and
not to fall into such disorders and extremities as hetherto
they haue done, for not looking euery man vnto his charge,
and not to suffer one ship leye the other a boorde, as they
haue done alreadie, whereby they ranne all into greate

that would go before, and others come after, and others by

<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
cast away themselues. And the better to auoid these daun∣gers,
and to kéepe the Fléete in good order, he did set down
certaine rules in writing by his Scriuenor, and firmed
therevnto his name, with the names of the other Cap∣taines,
which they should obserue and kéepe.</P>
<P>Inprimis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders that vvere giuen to euery cap¦tain, Ma∣ster and Pilot, to keepe the same in their voy¦age.</NOTE> That all the Fléete, as soone as it is night,

and that they haue a good regard, that one ship doe not lay

<P>Item, That as soone as it is day, they doe come and sa∣lute

that there was some Masters and Pilots very neglygent,
by whose default one ship did lay the other a boord, he com∣maunded
to remoue them from one ship to another: and
by this diligence that was thus vsed, euery man had a re∣gard
therevnto, and the Fléete went in good order, &amp; neuer
after ranne in any daunger. Thus going on their course in
the month of Iune, and iudging themselues ouer against
the Cape <HI>Buena spuransa,</HI> there fell vpon them a meruai∣lous
great storme of winde, with the which all the Fléete
ranne two dayes and two nights without sayles, so y<SUP>t</SUP> they
were in great daunger to haue bene all cast away, the we∣ther
being so darke and close, that it séemed rather night,
then day.</P>
<P>These two dayes béeing past, they saw certaine signes
of lande, the which as it did appeare, could not bée farre
off, and for that cause was the weather so close. After that
they had discryed y<SUP>e</SUP> same, &amp; were come néere thervnto, then
these signes appeared the greater. And therefore the Cap∣taine
generall commaunded, that out of his shippe there

should be shot two péeces of Ordinaunce, that the others
might after the same manner aunswere with the like, and
the better kéepe companie the one with the other. This
storme being past, they founde missing the ship of <HI>Lope
Mendez.</HI> And the Captaine generall séeing that he hadde
lost the sight thereof did not let to goe forwarde on his

<P>And so, within certaine dayes through the neglygence
of the Officers, one shippe layde the other a boorde, and
gaue therewith so great a blow vpon the how of y<SUP>e</SUP> other,
that with the same there was opened so great a hole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great leake giuē vnto one of y<SUP>e</SUP> ships through negligēce of the sai¦lers▪</NOTE> that

to be lost, for that he was there to succour them with his

in.</P>
<P>And for all that the Mariners of the ship did so work,
that or euer it was night the leake was halfe stopped: yet
that they might end y<SUP>•</SUP> rest that remayned to doe, the Cap∣taine

shippe, that the other Captaynes might come and succour
him, if there were any such néede. The wether being y<SUP>e</SUP> next
daye somewhat calme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The leak stopped, and the daunger thereof past, they sayle for∣vvard▪</NOTE> the leake was wholly ended, the

<P>And hauing knowledge that this was one of the thrée

in other places, then the Captaine generall did enter in
councell, whether that they thought good that he should set
vpon <HI>Grangalor</HI> or not, forasmuch as it held on the king of

<PB REF="165"/>
And now also the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> was come forth of the

<P>And forasmuch as it was spread abroade, that the Cap∣taine

<HI>Calycut</HI> was minded to returne and renewe the warres.
Now the Captaine generall béeing determined and aduised
by all the Captaines to set vppon <HI>Grangalor,</HI> he departed
one night with xv. boates, the which were armed with pa∣ueyses,
and with fiue and twentie <HI>Paraos</HI> from <HI>Coching,</HI>
replenished with Ordinaunce. Also with these there went
a Caruell, so that in the whole there were welnigh a thou∣sande

hée came to <HI>Palypuerto,</HI> for hée durst venture no further,

<P>At this place there came against him the Prince with

<P>The Captaine Generall of the enimies had in his com∣pany

first of all slaine, the Captaine generall and both his
sonnes, the which fought very valyantlye, and also manye
others, for that in this place was all the force of the Bat∣taile.
And as touching the <HI>Paraos</HI> that the other Captains
did set vpon, there was but little to doe, forsomuch that as
soone as they saw their ships boorded they fled their waye.
Wherevpon commaundement was giuen by the Captain
generall, that all our men should disimbarke themselues, of
whom the first fiue Captains were they that gaue the first
onset vpon <HI>Nambeadarin,</HI> who offered to resist, with cer∣taine
Nayres which he had in his retinue: with whome
our men did fight with so valyant a minde, that they made
theyr enimies to runne awaye. Then our men following
the chase did set fire to certeine houses, beside all y<SUP>•</SUP> Towne
which was dispoiled both by the Moores and Gentiles, the
which did well know, that our men would come vpon thē,
as also did <HI>Nambeadarin</HI> and his men, which fled awaye
along the water side. <HI>Edwarte Pacheco,</HI> and the Factour
<HI>Diego Hernando Correa,</HI> with the other Captaines didde
disimbarke themselues in another place, who immediately
began to set a fire the Citie. The Captaine generall in the
meane while remained along the water side to keepe his
men from scattering. Then the Christians that dwelt in
this Citie, and that were hidden amongst the houses, when
they saw the Towne all in a fire, came out from where
they were hidden, crieng with a loude voyce, and request∣ing
them not to kill them for that they were Christians.
And some of them ther wer, y<SUP>•</SUP> sent presently to the Cap∣taine
generall, to pray him that for Gods sake hée woulde
commaund the fire to be quenched, for that they shoulde els
burne certaine Churches of our Ladie and of the Apostles
which were in the Citie, as also their poore houses, y<SUP>•</SUP> which
were mingled with the houses of the Gentiles and Moores.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fire comman∣ded to be quenched for y<SUP>e</SUP> pore christians takes that dvvelt there▪</NOTE>
Then for their sakes, the Generall commaunded the fire
immediately to be quenched, although that many of theyr

<PB REF="166"/>
did burne quickly. The fire being quenched, our men
fel to ransaking of the houses of the Moores, among whom

Moreouer, the two shippes with their <HI>Paraos</HI> that were in
the water were likewise burnt, besides other thrée y<SUP>t</SUP> were
a land. This conflict yet continuing, there came thether the
Prince of <HI>Coching,</HI> who told the Captaine Generall, that
<HI>Nambeadaryn</HI> was not far off with his power, who was
determined to returne to the Citie, after that he was de∣parted.
Then the Captaines procured license of the Cap∣taine
Generall that he would suffer them to goe séeke him
out, &amp; so they did. But as soone as the enimies had sight of
them, they ran their way as fast as they could. The Cap∣taine
generall séeing this, did returne, &amp; wold haue set vpon
another Towne the which was not farre off, but for that

an Ankor in the harbour of <HI>Panane,</HI> and there to visite the
King of <HI>Tanor.</HI> But by reason of the ill weather they had,
and their naughtie Pilots they could not reach y<SUP>•</SUP> same, but
were driuen to <HI>Calycut</HI> and <HI>Pandarane.</HI> And from thence
he commaunded <HI>Pedro Raphael</HI> and <HI>Diego Pieres</HI> to go be∣fore
the Fléete, and to looke out, whether they could see any
ships of the Moores. Being ariued at <HI>Pandarane,</HI> &amp; bearing
along the Coast with a small winde, there came vpon them
x. <HI>Paros</HI> of the xvii. ships that were ther a lading. Our men
hauing sight of them, began forthwith to shoote at them
with their ordinaunce. The other Captayns being a Sea
boord, and hearing the sound of the ordinance, did returne,
and bare as close by the winde as they could.
<PB REF="168"/>
And hauing sight of the ships of the Moores to be a ground,
came to <HI>Cananor</HI> by the Captaine generalls commaunde∣ment,
who immediately entered into counsaile, in y<SUP>e</SUP> which
it was determined by the whole consent of his Captains,
that they shuld fight with those Moores, and that they shuld
goe in their boates, for that their ships could not come néere
vnto them, by reason they were within the Barre. And for
that the enimies were many, that therefore they should do
what they could to close with the ships, the which as soone
as they had done, they shuld set the same a fire. This being
appointed, the Captaine general with all y<SUP>e</SUP> other Captains
of the Fléete, did imbarke themselues in their boates, the
which were in all xv. in the which all the souldiers of the
Fléete did imbarke themselues, and that with a great cou∣rage
for that they went to fight with their enimies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great prouision of the Moores a∣gainst so fevv small boates.</NOTE> These
Moores as I sayd, had their ships within the Barre, lyeng
one close by another, with their stearnes toward the land,
and in the most part of them wer many souldiers, y<SUP>e</SUP> which
were men of coulour white. Their weapon were bowes
and arrowes, and also they had much ordinaunce. And on
the land, at the entering of the barre were placed two pée∣ces
of ordinaunce vpon a small bulwarke which they had
made. Our men bearing néere to this barre, had sight of the
Captaine generall, and how the Caruells were somewhat
farre off the shore, and that they came not, for that y<SUP>e</SUP> wind
was but small, and therefore were perforce driuen to re∣turne
backe for them, &amp; to bring them by force of the oare
within the Barre, for to succour their boates. The other
Captaines (although they saw him returne) went forward
by force of the oare, and at the entering of the Barre, the
Pellets fell as though it had rayned amongst them. But
for all this they entered, shooting of all their Ordinaunce.
But as their enimies were farre more then they, so theyr
arrowes were without number. And for that our men by
reason they wer somwhat low vnder their ships, wer open
without any defence, therefore did they receiue great hurt,
not onely by their ordinance, but also by their arrowes.
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
Héere as it appeared, was all the force of the battaile: and
for all the stoutnesse that was shewed by the enimies, yet
our men entred into the middes of all the multitude of the
shot, by force of the oare, in such sort y<SUP>t</SUP> it appered as though
the boats did flye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It had ben better to haue cal∣led vppon God to haue suc∣coured them in that extre¦mytye,</NOTE> the men crying out S. <HI>Iames,</HI> S. <HI>Iames,</HI>
&amp; with y<SUP>t</SUP> they laid those ships aboord: y<SUP>e</SUP> first y<SUP>t</SUP> laid any ship
aboord was <HI>Tristim de la Silua,</HI> as soone as he was within
the bar. And as y<SUP>e</SUP> men of this ship were many, so they did
shoote such abundance of arrows &amp; threw so many stones, y<SUP>t</SUP>
they made our men put off, who béeing off did immediate∣ly
close with another, in y<SUP>•</SUP> which for that there wer not so
many, they boorded the same in despite of the Moores for all
their stoutnes, in y<SUP>e</SUP> which wer some of them slaine, &amp; those
that remained aliue leapt for feare into the water &amp; swam
away. About y<SUP>e</SUP> same time y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Tristim de la Silua</HI> had layde
this ship a boord, <HI>Alonso de la cocta</HI> did the like vnto ano∣ther,
which he tooke to be y<SUP>e</SUP> Admirall, of y<SUP>e</SUP> which a Turke
was Captaine with all his company, which were manye.
And at the boording of this ship, were throwen such a mul∣titude
of stones and darts, that it was a wonder to sée. It
chaunced that before our men came to this ship, the eni∣mies
shooting at them with a péece, y<SUP>e</SUP> which was lieng vpō
the vpper decke, with y<SUP>e</SUP> recoyling it rent out a péece of the
ship side, so y<SUP>t</SUP> ther was made so great a hole, &amp; the enimies
not regarding it, thought it more néedfull to succor y<SUP>t</SUP> fore-part
of their ship. And when our boat came hard a boord y<SUP>e</SUP>
same side where this hole was, our men did enter by the
same. The first that entered, was <HI>Alonso Lopes</HI> Master, &amp;
another <HI>Aluoro Lopes,</HI> who was y<SUP>e</SUP> things seruant, &amp; is now
towne Clarke in <HI>Santaren,</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> others. These alto∣gether
with those y<SUP>t</SUP> came afterward so fought with their
enimies, that in the same conflict there were many slaine,
others hid themselues vnder the hatches, &amp; also others lept
into y<SUP>e</SUP> water, at y<SUP>e</SUP> which time the most part of them were
drowned, for that they wer laden with shirts of male. Im∣mediatelye
one <HI>Pero Alonso de Aguylar</HI> layde another
ship a boord, hauing in his company <HI>Lyonel Cotinuo,</HI> and
<PB REF="169"/>
also <HI>Edwarte Pacheco, Vasco Caruallo, Antonyo de Sal∣dano,</HI>
and <HI>Ruy Lorenso,</HI> who all behaued themselues very
valyauntly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mores for feare leap into the sea, &amp; drovvne thēselues.</NOTE> And as soone as they had taken this ship, they
immediately set the same a fire, and it tooke the same very
furiously, so that thereby their enemies were so excéedingly
afeard, that the most part of them leapt into the water and
drowned themselues. While this was a doing, thether
came the Captayne generall, with the Caruells, and béeing
entered within the Barre, he lefte them. Then one of the
péeces that were on the lande was shot off with a pellet,
which strake the Caruell of <HI>Pedro Raphael</HI> in such sort, &amp;
in such a place, that with the same were thrée of his men
slaine and ten sore hurt, and for lacke of winde, the floude
carried him vnder the forecastle of a ship, of those that wer
not as yet layd aboord, the which had many men. And for
that the shippe was higher then the Caruell, who had the
same vnder his sprit saile, therefore the enimies did enter,
and handeled our men very ill, for that they altogether did
set vpon them. Also there was another péece shot, with the
which the Master of the ship was slain, being at the helme
gouerning the Caruell, which being thus left at randon,
before that there came any other to the helme, the Caruell
fell vpon certaine Rockes, where she remained till the bat∣taile
was ended. The Captaine generall viewing the dan∣ger
that <HI>Pedro Raphael</HI> was in, commaunded him to bée
succoured, and so it was done. Then our men entering in∣to
the Caruell, the which was full of Moores, they behaued
themselues so valyantly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here vvas a great slaughter of the Por¦tingals in respect of other battailes sought.</NOTE> that they made them flye awaye,
but notwithstanding all our men that were within y<SUP>e</SUP> Car∣uell
were sore hurt. In the meane space, all the ships of the
enimies were burnt, and this also at the last, in the which
was burnt great store of Merchaundise, for that the same
was laden. Which was done the rather, for that vpon the
land there were many of the enimies which wer assembled
together. And for that of our men there were many hurt,
the Captain generall came his way with all his Captains
toward their ships, where he found that there were slaine
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
of our men xxv. and hurt an hundred and xxvii. men. But
for all this the victorie was great. For ouer and besides
the burning of the shippes with all their riches, the which
was much, the Captaine generall was giuen to vnderstand
by the Moores of <HI>Cananor,</HI> (to the which place from thence
he went) that ther were slaine in this battell two thousand
men. With this spoyle the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> remained so ill
contented, that frō that time for a good while after, he could
not restore himself, for that his losse was great, besides that
the Moores went from <HI>Calycut,</HI> by reason whereof there
was so great necessitie &amp; lacke of victuals there, that the ci∣tie
remained almost vninhabited.</P>

For as their pride was before this victore great, so theyr

did the king of <HI>Cananor</HI> alwayes tell. The Captaine Ge∣nerall
