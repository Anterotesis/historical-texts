<HEAD>¶ To his Countriemen, the Gen∣tlemen of the Countie of Kent.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Booke faire written (in gifte) lately sent vn∣to mee, doo J fayre prin∣ted (by dedication) now sende and commend vnto you.</P>
<P>I knowe not (in respect of the place) vnto whom I may more fitly thus send it then vnto you, that are eyther bred &amp; wel brought vp here, or by the good∣nesse of God and your own good proui∣sion, are well setled here: and here lawfullye possesse, or are neere vnto sundrie of those things, that this booke specially speaketh of: and thus, as of your selfes, doe you see what they are now, and thus as of this booke, may you knowe why they were, and by whome they were, and what they were long agone.</P>
<P>I knowe not (in respect of the per∣sons,)
<PB REF="3"/> vnto whō I may more fitly thus send it, then vnto you: with whome, I haue ben best and longest acquainted: from whō (by points of singular cour∣tesie) I haue been many wayes muche pleasured: Toward whom, for the ge∣nerall coniunction and association of your minds, and your selfes in good a∣mitie and familiaritie, one toward an other: and all, in good zeale towarde the aduancement of Christian religiō: and for the indifferent and discrete course ye keepe in handling and com∣pounding such controuersies, as many times fall (and thereby in nourishing peace, a Iewel most precious) betwene your honest and tractable neighbours, (things vnto almightie God, very ac∣ceptable: vnto her Maiestie, very grat¦full: vnto your countrie, very fruitful: vnto your selfes, very commendable:) Towarde whom, I say, for these causes
<PB REF="3"/> which, as a member of this Coūtie with others I see ioyfully and generally: and for the two first causes which deriued frō you, light vpon me self particular∣ly, I haue ben, and am, and must be ve∣ry louingelye affected.</P>
<P>I know not how I may more fitly and effectually commend it thē to say, that it is in substance, an hystorie: treating of the partes (and actions of greatest weight a good time together, done by the most famous persons) of one speci∣all Countrie: fet frō great antiquitie, which many men are much delighted with: out of sundry bookes with great studie collected, painfully: by this au∣thoure in the matter set out, truely: with good words wel placed, eloquent∣ly. In commendation of this booke, vpon a fit occasion, the like in a man∣ner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexander Neuil, Norwicus.</NOTE> is in Latine lately written by a Gentleman of our Countrie, knowne
<PB REF="4"/> to be very honest, and, I thinke, very well learned: and so vnder the au∣thoritie of his good iudgement, may I (without blame) the more boldly cō∣mend it vnto you.</P>
<P>What vtilitie foloweth the studie of Hystories, many of them haue well declared that haue published hysto∣ries writtē by theim selfes, or haue set out Hystories written by others. And therefore already sufficiently done, I neede not (vnlearned mee selfe, I can not) therein say muche. And yet thus much I may breefely say, and fit for the thing I haue in hande (me thinketh) I muste needes say, that (the sacred word of Almightie God alwayes excepted) there is nothing ei∣ther for our instruction more profita∣ble, or to our mindes more delectable, or within the compasse of common vn∣derstanding more easie or facile, then
<PB REF="4"/> the studie of hystories: nor that studie for none estate more meete, thē for the estate of Gentlemen: nor for the Gen∣tlemen of Englande, no Hystorie so meete, as the Hystorie of England. For, the dexteritie that men haue ey∣ther in prouiding for theimselfes, or in comforting their freendes (two very good things) or in seruing their King and Countrie (of all outward things, the best thing) doth rest cheefly vpon their awne &amp; other folks experience: which I may assuredly accompt (for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Tho∣mas Moore Knight, in the hysto∣rie of King Richard the thirde.</NOTE> in an hystorie, in our tong as wel written as any thing euer was, or I thinke euer shalbe, <HI>great experience</HI> deriued frō a proofe of two such things, as prospe∣ritie and aduersitie be, vpon a fit occa∣siō vnder the person of a very wisemā, is rightly accoūted) to be the very mo∣ther and maistres of wisdome. Now that that a number of folkes doth ge∣nerally,
<PB REF="5"/> is much more then that, that any one of vs can do specially, and so by other folks experiēce, are we taught largely: and that, that other folkes for their King, their coūtrie, theimselfes, their friends, like good men do vertu∣ously, ought to prouoke vs with good de¦uotion inwardly to loue theim: &amp; with good words openly much to commende theim, and in their vertuous actions, rightly to folow theim. And that, that other folkes against their King, their countrie, their friends (and so against theim selfes) like foolish men do igno∣rantly, or like leude men do wickedly, ought to moue vs first (as our neigh∣bours) Christianly to bewaile theim: and thē (as by presidents of peril pro∣cured through their awne follies and faults) dutifully and wisely to beware by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. And so by these mens experi∣ence (which like the burnt childe, that
<PB REF="5"/> then too late the fire dreadthe) with much repentaunce they bye deerely) are we taught and brought out of dā∣ger to settle our selues, as it were, in a seate of suretie. Thus you see what ex∣perience doth, and thus you see where other folkes experience is to be had: which, for the good estate of England (resting chiefly vpon the good iudge∣ment and seruice of the Gentlemen of England) is as J thinke, most proper∣ly fet from the Hystorie of England. And this for this purpose, I say bothe vnto you my country men the Gentle∣men of this Countie (a portion of the Realme) specially, and to al the Gen∣tlemen of the whole Realme beside, generally.</P>
<P>There resteth that for this booke (whiche I doe vpon these respectes thus send, and with these reasons thus commende vnto you) we shoulde vnto
<PB REF="6"/> the Authour <HI>William Lambard,</HI> yeelde oure verye hartie and perpe∣tuall thankes: as oure Country man in our wordes and deedes louingly vse him: as a man learned, duely e∣steeme him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathewe Parker Archebi∣shop of Canterbu∣ry in his Preface to the Booke de rebus ge¦stis Aelfre∣di Regis.</NOTE> (for a late very well lear∣ned and reuerend father hath publi∣quely and rightly so reputed him) as a Gentleman religious and very ho∣nest, make righte accompt of him: whiche, for my parte, I thinke meete to do, and meane to do: and for your partes, I desire heartely you should do, and I hope assuredly you will do. And if by you he might (and woulde) be moued at his good leysure, to doe as muche for all the rest of the Counties of this Realme generally, as he hathe done for this Countie specially (toward whiche J knowe, by great paine and good cost, he hath alredy vnder the ti∣tle of <HI>a Topographical dictionarie</HI>
<PB REF="6"/> gathered together greate store of very good matter) himselfe (the Authour of it) were worthy of good reward, &amp; singular commendation for it. You (the motioners) in the reading, shall receiue great pleasure by it: the rest of the Gentlemē of this Realme, that of themselfes see what things in their awne coūtries are of gretest fame now, &amp; by that boke shal know, what those things and other things were long a∣gone, must needes with great delight receiue it: and surely, being as he is vnto mee, a very deere freende, for myne awne parte, J meane also (God willing) vpon some fit occasion, with my request to further it. <HI>The xvj. of Aprill. 1576.</HI> Your Countrey man and very louing friende.</P>

<HEAD>¶ The exposition of this Map <HI>of the English</HI> Heptarchie, <HI>or <HI>seauen Kingdomes.</HI></HI></HEAD>
<P>TO the ende, that it may be vnderstoode, what is ment by the tearmes of <HI>Eastsaxons, Westsaxons, Mercia, Northumberland,</HI> and such other, of which there is com∣mon mention in the Treatise folowing: I haue thought good to prefixe a chard of the seauen sundry Kingdomes into the whiche this Realme was sometime diuided. But yet, for the better and more plaine explication of the matter, it shall bee good first to know, that all these Nations following haue had to doe within this our Countrie: The <HI>Brittons,</HI> the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the <HI>Scottes</HI> and <HI>Pictes,</HI> the <HI>Saxons,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Normanes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bry∣taines.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Bryttons</HI> (after the <HI>Samothees,</HI> and <HI>Albionees,</HI> whiche be of no great fame in our history) were the most auncient Inhabitantes of this land, and possessed it in peace, vntil <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> (the <HI>Romane</HI> Emperour) inua∣ded them: for so muche may a man gather of <HI>Horace</HI> his wordes, where he sayeth,
<Q><L>Intactus aut Brytannus,</L>
<L>Sacra vt descenderet catenatus via. &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>These therefore weare by <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> subdued to the <HI>Romane</HI> Empyre, and their country made a tributarie Prouince: in whiche case it continued many yeares to∣geather, vntyll at the length they being greiuously vexed with the <HI>Pictes</HI> and <HI>Scottes</HI> their neighbours on the North, and being vtterly voide of all hope of aide to bee had from the <HI>Romanes</HI> their patrons (who also at the same time weare sore afflicted with the inuasion of the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> and <HI>Vandales,</HI> like barbarous nations) they weare enforced to séeke for further helpe: And therefore sent into <HI>Germanie,</HI> from whence they receaued hyred
<PB N="2" REF="11"/> Souldiours, of the Nations called <HI>Saxons, Iutes,</HI> and <HI>Angles,</HI> vnder the conduicte of <HI>Hengist</HI> and <HI>Horsa,</HI> two naturall brethren, and both verie valiant Captaines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scots &amp; pictes.</NOTE>These <HI>Sctos</HI> (as them selues do write) weare a people of <HI>Scythia,</HI> that came first into <HI>Spaine,</HI> then into <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> and from thence to the North part of <HI>Britaine</HI> our Iland, where they yet inhabit: They were called <HI>Scots,</HI> or <HI>Scyttes,</HI> of <HI>Scyttan,</HI> which is <HI>to shoote:</HI> The <HI>Pictes</HI> also came from the same place after them, and occupied the parts where <HI>VVestmorland</HI> and <HI>Galoway</HI> now be. And they were called <HI>Pictes,</HI> either for that they vsed to paynte their bodies, to the ende to séeme the more terri∣ble, or els of the word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifieth a Champion, by reason of their great courage and har∣dinesse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Saxons, Iutes,</HI> &amp; <HI>Angles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Saxōs, Iutes, and Angles.</NOTE> weare the <HI>Germains</HI> that came ouer, (as we haue saide) in aide of the <HI>Bri∣tons,</HI> of which the first sorte inhabited <HI>Saxonie:</HI> the se∣conde were of <HI>Gotland,</HI> and therfore called <HI>Gutes,</HI> or <HI>Gottes:</HI> The thirde weare of <HI>Angria,</HI> or <HI>Anglia,</HI> a coun∣try adioyning to <HI>Saxonie,</HI> of which the Duke of <HI>Saxo∣nie</HI> is Lorde till this day, and beareth the name therof in his <HI>stile,</HI> or title of honour, and of these last we all be cal∣led <HI>Angli,</HI> English men.</P>
<P>These <HI>Germaines,</HI> for a season serued against the <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Picts:</HI> But afterwarde (entised by the plea∣sure of this countrey, and the fraude of the enemies) they ioyned handes with them, and all at once set vpon the <HI>Britons</HI> that brought them in: and so, driuing them into <HI>Fraunce, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI> possessed their dwel∣ling places, and diuided the countrye amongst them∣selues. Howbeit, they also wāted not their plague: For af¦ter that they had long warred one vpon another, for the enlarging of their particular kingdomes, and had at the
<PB N="3" REF="11"/> last so beaten y<SUP>e</SUP> one the other, that the whole was by the <HI>Westsaxons</HI> reduced into one entier Monarchie, sodain∣ly the <HI>Danes</HI> (a people of <HI>Norway,</HI> &amp; <HI>Denmarke</HI>) came vpon them, and after much mischiefe done, in the ende tooke the crowne quite and cleane from them.</P>
<P>But they were expulsed after thirtie yeares trouble, and the <HI>Englishe</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Nation restoared to the royall dignitie: which yet they enioyed not many yeares after.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nor∣mans.</NOTE> For straight vpon the death of <HI>Edward</HI> the Con∣fessor, William of <HI>Normandy</HI> (whose people at the first came from <HI>Norway</HI> also, and were therfore called <HI>Nor∣mans</HI>) demaunded the Crowne, and wan it of <HI>Harold</HI> in the Fielde, whose posteritie holdeth it tyll this day.</P>
<P>Thus muche of the Nations, that haue had interest in this Realme: Now to our purpose, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seuen kingdomes</NOTE> to the diuisi∣on of the same into the sundrye kingdomes vnder the <HI>Saxons.</HI> And although (by reason of the continuall con∣tention that was amongst them for enlarging their bounds) there can no certaine limits of their kingdomes be appointed, yet wee wil go as neare the trouth as wee can, and folow the best approued <HI>authours</HI> that haue written thereof.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> The first Kingdome therefore, was called the King∣dome of the <HI>Westsaxons,</HI> bicause it was in the <HI>West</HI> parte of the Realme, and it comprehended the whole Shires of <HI>Southampton, Berk, Wilton, Dorset,</HI> and <HI>Somerset,</HI> besides some partes of <HI>Surrey, Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Deuonshyre:</HI> As for the residue of <HI>Deuonshyre,</HI> and whole <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the <HI>Britons</HI> reteyned it, whose lan∣guage is not there as yet forgotten.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> The seconde, was the <HI>Southsaxon</HI> Kingdome, (so ter∣med bicause it lay <HI>South</HI>) and conteined whole <HI>Sussex,</HI> and the remaine of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/> The thirde, was the <HI>Kentish</HI> Kingdome, and had for the most part the same boundes, y<SUP>t</SUP> the Shyre of <HI>Kent</HI> yet hath, although at some tyme, and by the prowes of some King, it was extended muche further.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/> The Kingdome of <HI>Estsex,</HI> or of the <HI>Estsaxons</HI> was the fourth, which was named of the situation also, and included the whole Shires of <HI>Estsex,</HI> and <HI>Midlesex,</HI> with some portion of <HI>Hartfordshyre.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/> The fifte, was of the East <HI>Angles,</HI> or East <HI>English∣men,</HI> consisting of the Ile of <HI>Elye,</HI> and the Shyres of <HI>Norfolke, Suffolke,</HI> and <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/> The Kingdome of <HI>Mercia,</HI> or <HI>Mearclande,</HI> had the sixt place, which was so called of the Saxon woords <HI>Mearc</HI> signifiyng a bounde, limit, or marke, as wee yet speake: and that, bicause it lay in the midst of this our Iland, as vpon the whiche al the residue of the King∣domes did bounde, and weare bordered. In this King∣dome weare wholy these Shyres, <HI>Lincolne, Northamp∣ton, Rutlande, Huntingdon, Bedford, Buckingham, Oxford, Chester, Derby, Notingham, Stafforde:</HI> And partly <HI>Hereford, Hartford, Warwick, Shropshire,</HI> and <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/> <HI>Northumberlande</HI> (so called, because it laye North from the Riuer <HI>Humber</HI>) was the seauenth Kingdome: and it enuironned <HI>Yorkshire, Durham, Northumber∣lande, Cumberlande,</HI> and <HI>Westmerlande</HI> wholy, and so muche of <HI>Lancashire</HI> besides, as was not in <HI>Mercia.</HI></P>

<P>It is called by <HI>Caesar,</HI> and other auncient writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kent, why so named.</NOTE> <HI>Cancium,</HI> and <HI>Cancia</HI> in latine, which name (as I make coniecture) was framed out of <HI>Cainc,</HI> a woorde that (in the language of the <HI>Britaines,</HI> whom <HI>Caesar</HI> at his ar∣riuall founde inhabiting there) signifyeth, <HI>bowghes,</HI> or woods, and was imposed, by reason that this Countrie, both at that time, and also longe after, was in manner wholy ouergrowne with <HI>woode,</HI> as it shall hereafter in fyt place more plainly appeare.</P>
<P>The Aire in <HI>Kent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Aire.

<P>The <HI>Soile</HI> is for the most parte bountifull, consisting indifferently of arable, pasture, meadow and woodland, howbeit of these, wood occupieth the greatest portion

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pas∣ture.</NOTE>The pasture and meadowe, is not onely sufficient in proportion to the quantitie of the country it selfe for brée∣ding, but is comparable in fertilitie also to any other that is neare it, in so muche that it gayneth by féeding.</P>

<P>As for red Déere, and blacke Conyes, it nourisheth them not, as hauing no great walkes of wast grounde for the one, and not tarying the tyme to rayse the gaine by the other: for, blacke conyes are kept partly for their skins, which haue their season in Winter: and <HI>Kent</HI> by the nearnesse to London, hath so quicke market of yong Rabbets, that it killeth this game chiefly in Summer.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The yeomē</NOTE>The <HI>yeomanrie,</HI> or commmon people (for so they be called of the Saxon word <HI>gemen</HI> which signifieth com∣mon) is no where more free, and ioily, then in this shyre:

<P>At the time of this mariage, <HI>Hengist</HI> (labouring by all meanes to bring in his owne Countrie men) begged of the King the territories of <HI>Kent, Essex, Midlesex,</HI> and <HI>Suffolke,</HI> (then knowen by other names) pretending in woord, that he would, in consideration thereof, kéep out <HI>Aurel. Ambrose,</HI> (a competitor of the crowne) whose arriual King <HI>Vortiger</HI> much feared, But meaning in déede, to make thereby a key to let into the Realme multitudes of <HI>Germanes,</HI> for furtherance of his ambiti∣ous desire and purpose: which thing in processe of time he brought to passe, not onely creating himselfe and his posteritie <HI>Kings</HI> of a large quarter, but also thereby shewing the way and entrie, howe others of his nation might follow, and doe the like.</P>
<P>And thus <HI>Kent,</HI> being once againe (as I saide) redu∣ced into a <HI>Kingdome,</HI> continued in that estate, by the space of thrée hundreth thrée score and eight yeares, or thereabouts, in the handes of fiftéene successours, as the moste credible authours do reporte: Some others adde, <HI>Edbert,</HI> and <HI>Alric,</HI> and so make seuentéene in all, whose names doe followe.</P>

<P>Now, although it might here séeme conuenient, be∣fore I passed any further, to disclose suche memorable things, as haue chaunced during the reignes of al these forenamed <HI>Kings:</HI> yet for asmuche as my purpose speci∣ally is to write a <HI>Topographie,</HI> or description of places, and no <HI>Chronographie,</HI> or storie of times, (although I must now and then vse bothe, since the one can not ful∣ly be perfourmed without enterlacing the other.) and for that also I shal haue iust occasion hereafter in the particulars of this <HI>Shyre,</HI> to disclose many of the same, I will at this present, and that by way of digression only, make report of one or two occurrents that happe∣ned vnder <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> &amp; <HI>Eadric,</HI> two Kings of this coun∣trey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ethelbert, the King of Kent.</NOTE>This <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> besides that he mightely enlarged the boundes of his owne Kingdome, extending the same euen to the riuer of <HI>Humber,</HI> was also the first King (a∣mongst the <HI>Saxons,</HI> inhabiting this land) that promoted the kingdome of <HI>Christ,</HI> as to whome it pleased almigh∣ty
<PB N="19" REF="19"/> God to break the bread of his holy woord and gospel, through the ministerie and preaching of <HI>Augustine</HI> the Moncke, that was sent from <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Pope Gregorie</HI> surnamed the great: amongst the <HI>Saxons</HI> I saide, least a∣ny man should thinke, that eyther the faith of Christe, was not heare at all, or not so purely preached, before the comming of that <HI>Augustine.</HI> <MILESTONE N="527"/> For it is past all doubt, by the stoaries of all Countries, and by the testi∣monie of <HI>Beda</HI> him selfe (being a <HI>Saxon</HI>) that the <HI>Bri∣tons</HI> embraced the religion of <HI>Christ</HI> within this Iland, many hundreth yeares before <HI>Gregories</HI> time: whether in purer sorte then he sent it hither, or no, let them iudge that knowe, that he was called (worthely) <HI>Pater Caeremoniarum,</HI> and that may yet sée in <HI>Beda,</HI> and others, what trūpery crept into the church of <HI>God</HI> in his time and by his permission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eadric, the King of Kent.</NOTE> <HI>Eadric</HI> the other King succéeded in <HI>Kent,</HI> after <HI>Lotharius,</HI> who, because he rather reigned by luste, then ruled by lawe, incurred the hatred of his people, and was inuaded by <HI>Ceadwalla</HI> (King of <HI>West∣sex</HI>) and <HI>Mull</HI> his brother: whiche entring the countrie, and finding no resistance, herryed it from the one end to the other: &amp; not thus contented, <HI>Ceadwalla,</HI> in reuenge of his brother <HI>Muls</HI> death, (whome the countrie people had cruelly slaine in a house, that he had taken for his succour) entred this countrie the second time, and sleying the people, spoiled it without all pitie. And yet not satis∣fied with all this, he suffered the quarrell to discend to <HI>Ina</HI> his successour, who ceased not to vnquiet the people of this <HI>Shyre,</HI> till they agréed to pay him <HI>30000.</HI> Markes in golde, for his desired amendes.</P>
<P>These be the matters that I had to note in y<SUP>e</SUP> reignes of these two Kings: as for the rest, I passe them ouer to their fit titles, as things rather perteining to some peculiar places, then incident to the body of the whole
<PB N="20" REF="20"/> Shire, and will now prosecute the residue.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="827"/> In the time of this <HI>Baldred,</HI> that standeth last in the table of the Kings, <HI>Kent</HI> was vnited by King <HI>Egbert</HI> (who last of all chaunged the name of the people, and called them <HI>Englishmen</HI>) vnto the <HI>Westsaxon</HI> King∣dome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First name of English∣men.</NOTE> which in the ende became Ladie and maistres of al the rest of the kingdomes also: and it was from thenceforth wholy gouerned after the <HI>Westsaxon</HI> law, as in the Mappe of the tripartite lawes of this Realme hathe appeared, vntil suche time as King <HI>Alfred</HI> first diuided the whole Realme into particular <HI>Shires,</HI> vpon this occasion following.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beginning of Shires.</NOTE>The <HI>Danes,</HI> bothe in his time, and before, had flocked by sea to the coastes of this land in great numbers, some times wasting and spoiling with sword, and fire, where∣soeuer they might arriue: and sometymes taking with them greate booties to their Ships without doing any further harme: which thing (continuing for many yeares togeather) caused the husbandmen to abandon their til∣lage, and gaue occasion and hardinesse to euill disposed persons to fall to the like pillage, and robberie: The whiche, the better to cloke their mischief withall, feig∣ned them selues to bee <HI>Danishe</HI> Pirates, and would some time come on land in one part, and some time in an other, driuing great spoyles (as the <HI>Danes</HI> had done) to theire shippes before theim. <MILESTONE N="892"/> The good king <HI>Alfred</HI> therefore, that had merueilously traueiled in re∣pulsing the barbarous <HI>Danes,</HI> espying this outrage, and thinking it no lesse the parte of a politique <HI>Prince,</HI> to roote out the noisome subiect, then to hold out the forein enemie, by aduice of his counsail, and by the example of <HI>Moses</HI> (which followed the counsaile of <HI>Ietro,</HI> his father in law) diuided the whole Realme into certein parts, or <HI>Sections</HI> (being two and thirtie in number, as I gesse)
<PB N="21" REF="20"/> whiche of the Saxon woorde <HI>Scyran,</HI> signifiyng to cut, he termed <HI>shires,</HI> or (as we yet speake) <HI>shares,</HI> and portions: and appointed ouer euery one shyre, an <HI>Earle,</HI> or <HI>Alder∣man</HI> (or both) to whome he committed the gouernment and rule of the same.</P>
<P>These <HI>shyres</HI> he also brake into smaller parts, wher∣of some were called <HI>Lathes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lathes.</NOTE> of the woord <HI>gelaþian,</HI> which is, to assemble together: others, <HI>hundreds,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hundreds.</NOTE> bycause they conteyned iurisdiction ouer an <HI>hundreth</HI> pledges: and others, <HI>Tithings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tythings.</NOTE> so named, bycause there were in eche of them to the number of <HI>ten persons,</HI> whereof eche one was suretie and pledge for others good abearing. He ordeined furthermore, that euery man shoulde procure him selfe to be receiued into some <HI>Tithing,</HI> and that if a∣ny were founde of so small credite, that his neighbours woulde not become pledge for him, he should foorthwith be cōmitted to pryson, least he might do harme abroade.</P>
<P>By this deuice it came to passe, that good subiectes (the trauailing Bées of the Realme) resorted safely to their la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors againe, and the euil and idle <HI>Droanes</HI> were driuen cleane out of the hyue of the common wealth: so that in short time, the whole Realme tasted of the swéet hony of this blessed peace, and tranquilitie.</P>
<P>Some shadow I do confesse, of this King <HI>Alfredes</HI> po∣litique institution, remayneth euen til this day in those courts which we cal <HI>Leetes,</HI> where these pledges be yet named <HI>franci plegij,</HI> of y<SUP>e</SUP> woord <HI>freoborgh,</HI> which is a frée pledge; But if the very Image it self were amongst vs, who séeth not what benefit would ensue thereby, as wel towardes the suppression of busie théeues, as for the cor∣rection of idle vagabounds, whiche be the very séede of robbers and théeues. But leauing this matter to suche as beare the sworde, I will plye my penne, and goe forwarde.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
<P>Thus muche therefore I thought good, nowe at the first to open, the more at large, bicause it may serue ge∣nerally for all <HI>Shyres,</HI> and shall hereafter deliuer me frō often repetition of one thing. Where, by the way, (least I might séeme to haue forgotten the <HI>Shire</HI> that I haue presently in hand) it is to be noted, that that which in the west coūtrey was at that time, (and yet is) called, a <HI>Ti∣thing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bosholder, &amp; Tithing∣man.</NOTE> is in <HI>Kent</HI> termed a <HI>Borow,</HI> of the <HI>Saxon</HI> woord, <HI>borh,</HI> which signifieth a <HI>Pledge,</HI> or a suretie: and the chiefe of these pledges, which the <HI>Westernmen</HI> call a <HI>Tithingman,</HI> they of <HI>Kent</HI> name a <HI>Borsholder,</HI> of the <HI>Saxon</HI> woordes <HI>borHes ealdor,</HI> that is to say, the most Auncient, or <HI>elder</HI> of the <HI>Pledges,</HI> whiche thinge bee∣ing vnderstood, the matter will come all to one ende, and I may go forward.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1066"/> In this plight therfore, both this <HI>Shyre</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> and al the residue of the <HI>Shyres</HI> of this Realme, were found, when <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Normandie</HI> inuaded this <HI>Realme:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kent kee∣peth her olde cus∣tomes.</NOTE> at whose hands the cominaltie of <HI>Kent,</HI> obtey∣ned with great honour, the continuation of their aun∣cient vsages, notwithstanding that the whole <HI>Realme</HI> besides suffered alteration and chaunge.</P>
<P>For proofe whereof, I will call to witnesse <HI>Thomas Spot,</HI> sometimes a Moncke and Chronicler of saint <HI>Au∣gustines</HI> at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who, if he shall séeme to weake to giue sufficient authoritie to the tale, bycause he only (of all the <HI>Storiers</HI> that I haue seene) reporteth it, Yet, forasmuch as I my selfe first published that note out of his hystorie, and for that the matter it selfe also is nei∣ther incredible, nor vnlikely, (the rather bycause this <HI>Shyre,</HI> euen vnto this day, enioyeth the custome of <HI>giue all kyn discent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gauelkyn.</NOTE> dower of the moytie, fréedome of birth, &amp; sundrie other vsages muche different from other coun∣tries, I neither well may, ne will at all sticke, nowe eft∣soones to rehearse it.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1067"/> After such tyme (saith he) as <HI>Duke William</HI> the <HI>Con∣querour</HI> had ouerthrowne King <HI>Harold</HI> in the field, at Battel in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and had receiued the <HI>Londoners</HI> to mercy, he marched with his army toward the Castle of <HI>Douer,</HI> thinking thereby to haue brought in subiection this countrie of <HI>Kent</HI> also. But <HI>Stigande,</HI> the Archebi∣shop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Egelsine</HI> the Abbat of saint <HI>Au¦gustines,</HI> perceauing the daūger, assembled the countrie men together, and laide before them the intollerable pride of the <HI>Normanes</HI> that inuaded them, &amp; their owne miserable condition, if they should yelde vnto them. By whiche meanes, they so enraged the cōmon people, that they ran foorth with to weapon, and méeting at <HI>Swan∣scombe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Swanes∣combe.</NOTE> elected the Archbishop and the Abbat for their captaines: This done, eache man gotte him a gréene boughe in his hand, and bare it ouer his head, in suche sort, as when the <HI>Duke</HI> approched, he was muche ama∣sed therewith, thinking at the first, that it had ben some miraculous wood, that moued towards him: But they as soone as hee came within hearing, caste away their boughes from them, and at the sounde of a trumpet be∣wraied their weapons, and withall dispatched towards him a messenger, which spake vnto him in this manner. <HI>The commons of Kent (most noble Duke) are readie to offer thee, eyther peace, or warre, at thine own choyse, and election: peace with their faithfull obedience, if thou wilt permit them to enioy their ancient liberties: warre, and that moste deadly, if thou deny it them.</HI></P>
<P>Now when the <HI>Duke</HI> heard this, and considered that the daunger of deniall was great, and that the thing de∣sired was but smal, he forthwith, more wisely then wil∣lingly, yealded to their request: And by this meane both he receiued <HI>Douer</HI> Castle, &amp; the Countrie to obe∣dience, &amp; they only of all <HI>England,</HI> (as shall hereafter ap∣peare (obtained for euer theyr accustomed priuiledges.</P>

<HEAD>¶ A short counsell, as touching the Bryttishe hystorie.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lbeit that I am iustly occasioned (before I make myne entrie) to speake largely, for confirmation of the credite of oure <HI>Bryttishe</HI> or <HI>Welshe hystorie,</HI> (the faith wherof is by <HI>William Petite,</HI> and <HI>Poli∣dore Virgile</HI> called into question) for as muche, as I shal be enforced to vse it as a ground worke of my whole frame and building: yet for that I mynde not in any part of this my labour, to handle with many wordes, matters in controuersie, (being otherwise suffi∣ciently charged with things more incident to my pur∣pose, and no lesse fit to be knowne.) And bycause also that matter hath alreadie founde more learned and dili∣gent <HI>patrones,</HI> I will with fewe wordes passe it ouer, contenting my selfe, if I shall haue added to other mens heapes, one small proofe or twaine, whiche by chaunce I gleaned after them, and referring suche as desire more aboundant testimonies, to the reading of <HI>Iohn Leland,</HI> and Syr <HI>Iohn ap Rese,</HI> two learned men, that haue plen¦tifully written therein.</P>
<P>The state of the matter is this, whether <HI>Geffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouthe</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Geffray of Monmouth</NOTE> be the authour of the <HI>Bryttish</HI> storie (as <HI>William Newborow,</HI> and <HI>Polydore</HI> charge him) or the <HI>translatour</HI> thereof onely out of the <HI>Bryttishe,</HI> as him selfe in his booke professeth. Whereof must néedes en∣sue, That if the worke be his owne, it hath no more credite, then he him selfe (being the author) coulde bring vnto it: But if he did only translate that, whiche <HI>Wal∣ter</HI> the <HI>Archdeacon</HI> of <HI>Oxforde</HI> brought out of <HI>Normā∣die,</HI> and deliuered vnto him, Then doth not y<SUP>e</SUP> estimation
<PB N="60" REF="44"/> depende vpon <HI>Geffray,</HI> but vpon some other (wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>soe∣uer he were) that first wrate it.</P>
<P>Now, that it may appeare vnto you, that he was on∣ly the interpreter of that whiche came out of <HI>Norman∣die,</HI> I will call to witnesse, <HI>Henrie</HI> the <HI>Archdeacon</HI> of <HI>Huntington,</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>king Henrie</HI> the first, and was somwhat before <HI>William Petites</HI> dayes, who (as him self confesseth) was borne in the beginning of the reigne of <HI>king Stephan,</HI> about whiche time <HI>Gef∣fray</HI> of <HI>Monmouthe</HI> was on liue also.</P>
<P>This <HI>Henrie</HI> (besides a learned hystorie of the realme) wrate thrée seuerall <HI>treatises</HI> whiche I haue séene: One intituled, <HI>De miraculis Angliae:</HI> An other, <HI>De serie Regū potentissimorum:</HI> And the thirde, <HI>De origine Regum Bry∣tannorum.</HI> In this latter, he sayth playnly. That at such time as he trauayled towardes <HI>Rome,</HI> he founde (in an auncient Librarie of the <HI>Abbay</HI> of <HI>Bec</HI>) an olde booke, in∣tituled likewise, <HI>De origine Regum Brytannorū,</HI> the which beginning at the arriuall of <HI>Brute,</HI> ended with the actes of <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> and agréed thoroughout (as by collatiō I collected) with this our <HI>Bryttishe</HI> hystorie, which I doubt whether <HI>Henrie</HI> of <HI>Huntington</HI> had euer séene. Nowe therefore, if this were an olde booke in his time, it coulde not be newe in the dayes of <HI>Petite,</HI> that succéeded him: And if the argument were written before in the <HI>Bryt∣tish</HI> tongue, it is very probable, that he was not the first author, but only the translator thereof in <HI>Latine.</HI> For further likelyhoode whereof, I my selfe haue an aunci∣ent <HI>Bryttish,</HI> or <HI>Welshe</HI> copy, which I reserue for shew, and doe reuerence for the antiquitie, litle doubting, but that it was written before the dayes of <HI>William Petite,</HI> who, as he was the first, So vpon the matter recken I him the onely man, that euer impugned the <HI>Bryttishe</HI> hystorie. For as touching <HI>Polydore</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polydore.</NOTE> (though he were a
<PB N="61" REF="44"/> man singularly well learned) yet since hee was of our owne time, and no longer since, his forces must of ne∣cessity be thought to bée bent, rather against the veritie, then against the antiquitie of that writing. Wherein if he shall seeke to discredit the whole worke, for that in some partes it conteineth matter, not only vnlikely, but incredible also: then shall he bothe depriue this Nation of all manner of knowledge of their first beginning, and open the way for vs also to cal into question the origine, and antiquities of <HI>Spaine, Fraunce, Germanie,</HI> yea and of <HI>Italie</HI> his owne countrie: in which, that whiche <HI>Liuie</HI> reporteth of <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus, Numa</HI> and <HI>Aegeria,</HI> is as farre remoued from all suspicion of truthe, as any thing, whatsoeuer y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Galfride</HI> writeth, either of <HI>Brute, Merlin,</HI> or <HI>King Arthur</HI> himselfe.</P>
<P>Séeing therefore, that euen as corne hath his chaffe, and metall his drosse, so can there harldly any wryter of the auncient hystorie of any nation be founde out that hath not his propre vanities mixed with sincere veritie: the part of a wise Reader shalbe, not to reiect the one for doubt of the other, but rather with the fire and fan, of iudgement and discretion, to trie and sift them a sun∣der. And as my purpose is for mine owne parte, to vse the commoditie thereof, so oft, as it shall like me: so my counsell shalbee, that other men will, bothe in this and other, obserue this one rule, <HI>That they neither reiect without reason, nor receiue without discretion, and iudgement.</HI></P>
<P>Thus muche in my way, for assertion of the <HI>Bryttish hystorie</HI> I thought good to say once for all, to the ende that from hencefoorthe (whatsoeuer occasion of debate shalbe offered, concerning eyther the veritie or antiqui∣tie of the same) I neither trouble my selfe, nor tarrie my Reader, with any further defence, or <HI>Apologie.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Byshops See, and Diocesse, of Canterbury.</HEAD>
<P>HE that shal aduisedly consider the plot of this <HI>Shyre,</HI> may finde thrée diuerse (and those not vnfit) wayes, to deuide it: One, by breaking the whole into the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Kent:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of this de∣scription.</NOTE> An other, by parting it, (as <HI>Watling streate</HI> leadeth,) into <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Southe Kent:</HI> And a third, by seuering it into the two distinct <HI>Dioceses</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Rochester.</HI> Of these thrée, I haue de∣termined to chuse the last, both bycause that kinde of diuision hath as certaine limits, as any of the former, &amp; for that, it séemeth to me the moste conuenient seue∣rance, being wrought both by bounde of place, and of <HI>iu∣risdiction</HI> also. And because the <HI>See</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> is not onely the more worthy of the twaine, but also the <HI>Metropolitane,</HI> and chiefe of the whole realme: I haue thought good, in the first place, to shewe the beginning and increase of that Bishopricke, and afterward to pro∣secute the description and hystorie of the principal parts belonging to the same.</P>
<P>It is to be séene, in the <HI>Brittishe</HI> hystorie, and others, that at suche time as King <HI>Lucius</HI> (the first christened Prince of this land) had renounced the damnable dark∣nes of <HI>Paganisme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Flamines turned into Bishops.</NOTE> and embrased the glorious light of the Gospel of God, he chaunged the <HI>Archeflamines</HI> of London, Yorke, and <HI>Caerleon,</HI> into so many Archebi∣shops: and the <HI>Flamines,</HI> of other inferiour places, into inferiour Bishops, through out his whole realme. How¦beit, this matter is not so cleare, but that it is encounte∣red by <HI>William Petit,</HI> whiche (in the Proheme of his hystorie) affirmeth boldly, that the Britons whiche pro∣fessed Christian religion within this Iland, before y<SUP>e</SUP> cō∣ming of <HI>Augustine,</HI> were contented with Bishops only, &amp; that <HI>Augustine</HI> himselfe was the very first, that euer had the Archbishops <HI>Palle</HI> amongst vs. As touching Bi¦shops it is euidēt by <HI>Beda</HI> him self, that both before, &amp; in
<PB N="63" REF="45"/> <HI>Augustines</HI> time, <HI>Wales</HI> alone had seuen at the lest: but as for Archebishops (although for my owne opinion I thinke with <HI>William,</HI> the rather for y<SUP>t</SUP> I suppose, y<SUP>t</SUP> the simplicity of y<SUP>e</SUP> Britain clergie, was not as thē enamou∣red with the vain titles of the <HI>Romane</HI> arrogancy) yet to the end that the reader may be therby the more iust∣ly occasioned, to make inquisition of the trueth in that point, it shall not be greatly out of his way, to send him by <HI>Siluester Giraldus, Canbrensis,</HI> a man (considering y<SUP>e</SUP> age (excellently wel learned, &amp; which liued about y<SUP>e</SUP> same time w<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Williā Petit,</HI> or <HI>Williā of Newborow</HI>) as some cal him. This man, in a book which he entituled, <HI>Itinera∣riū Walliae,</HI> setteth forth moste plainly the Archbishops, y<SUP>t</SUP> in olde time were at <HI>Caerleon,</HI> their translation from thence to Saint Dauids, their transmigration from Saint Dauids ouer the <HI>Sea</HI> into <HI>Normandie,</HI> and the whole Catalogue of their succession in each of those pla∣ces. But here, some man, thinking me more mindful to direct others, thē careful to kepe mine own wai, wil hap¦pely aske me, what pertineth it (I pray you to <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> whether there haue ben Archbishops at <HI>London, Yorke,</HI> &amp; <HI>Carleon,</HI> or no?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Londō spoi¦led of the Archebi∣shopricke.</NOTE> yes (no doubt) it maketh great∣ly to our treatise of <HI>Canterbury:</HI> for, not onely y<SUP>e</SUP> forena∣med Brittish historie, <HI>Mathew</HI> of Westminster, &amp; <HI>Wil∣liā</HI> of Malmesbury do shew manifestly, that <HI>Augustine</HI> by great iniury spoiled Londō of this dignitie of y<SUP>e</SUP> Arch∣bishops chaire, bestowing y<SUP>e</SUP> same vpon <HI>Canterbury:</HI> but y<SUP>e</SUP> Epistle of <HI>Pope Gregorie</HI> himself also, (which is to be read in y<SUP>e</SUP> Ecclesiasticall storie of <HI>Beda</HI>) cōuinceth him of manifest presumption &amp; arrogācie, in y<SUP>t</SUP> he sticked not to prefer his own fantasie &amp; liking before y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Pope</HI> his mais∣ters institution &amp; cōmaūdement. For <HI>Pope Gregory</HI> ap¦pointed two Archbishops, y<SUP>e</SUP> one at <HI>London</HI> the other at <HI>Yorke,</HI> whereof either should haue vnder him <HI>12.</HI> inferi∣our Bishops, &amp; wherof neither should be subiect to other:
<PB N="64" REF="46"/> only for <HI>Augustines</HI> honour) hee willed, that they all should bée vnder him during his lyfe. But <HI>Augustine</HI> not so contēted, both remained resident during al his life at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and before he died consecrated <HI>Lau∣rence Archebishop</HI> there, least, eyther by his owne death, or want of another fit man to fill the place, the chaire might happely be carried to <HI>London,</HI> as <HI>Grego∣rie</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> had appointed.</P>
<P><HI>Mathew</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> saith, that <HI>Merlin</HI> had pro∣phecied, <HI>Dignitas Londoniae adornabit Dorobriniam. <HI>Wil∣liam Malmesbury</HI></HI> writeth, that he did it, <HI>Sedulitate Re∣gis hospitis,</HI> (meaning King <HI>Ethelbert) <HI>&amp; ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritate ciuium captus:</HI></HI> But I thinke verely, that he ment thereby to leaue a glorious monument of his swelling pride &amp; va∣nitie: wherevnto I am the rather led, by the obserua∣tion of his stately behauiour vsed towards the <HI>Bryttish Bishops,</HI> and some other of his acts, that sauour greatly of vaineglory, ambition, and insolence. Whatsoeuer the cause were that moued him thus to apparell <HI>Canter∣bury</HI> with the <HI>Archebishop</HI> of <HI>Londons Palle,</HI> at <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> hath it continued euer sithence, sauing that at one time, <HI>Offa</HI> the King of <HI>Mercia</HI> (or midle <HI>England</HI>) partly of a disposition to honour his owne countrie, and partly of a iuste displeasure conceaued againste <HI>Lam∣bright</HI> (or <HI>Ianbright,</HI> as some copies haue it, the thir∣téenth <HI>Archebishop,</HI>) for matter of treason, transla∣ted the honour of the <HI>See,</HI> eyther wholly, or partly, to <HI>Lichefield:</HI> But there it remained not long, for after the death of <HI>King Offa, Kenulsus</HI> his successour restored <HI>E∣thelard</HI> to his place at <HI>Canterbury</HI> againe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The in∣crease of the Arche∣bishop∣ricke,</NOTE>The whole <HI>Prouince</HI> of this <HI>Bishopricke</HI> of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> was at the firste diuided by <HI>Theodorus</HI> (the seuenthe <HI>Bishop</HI>) into fiue Diocesse only: howbe∣it in processe of tyme it grewe to twentie and one, be∣sides it selfe, leauing to <HI>Yorke</HI> (which by the first insti∣tution,
<PB N="33" REF="46"/> should haue had as many as it) but <HI>Durham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conttentiō for the Pri∣macie.</NOTE> <HI>Carleil,</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> only. And whereas by the same ordinance of <HI>Gregorie,</HI> neither of these <HI>Archebishoppes</HI> ought to be inferiour to other, saue only in respect of the prioritie of their consecration, <HI>Lanfranc</HI> (thinking it good reason that he should make a conquest of the Englishe <HI>Clergie,</HI> since his maister <HI>King William</HI> had vanquish∣ed the whole nation) contēded at <HI>Windsore</HI> with <HI>Tho∣mas Norman (Archebishoppe</HI> of <HI>Yorke</HI>) for the prima∣cie, <MILESTONE N="1072"/> and there by iudgement before <HI>Hugo</HI> the <HI>Popes Legate</HI> recouered it from him: so that euer since, the one is called <HI>Totius Angliae primas,</HI> and the other, <HI>Angliae primas,</HI> without any further addition. Of which iudge∣ment (one forsooth) hathe yeelded this great reason: that euen as the <HI>Kentish</HI> people, by an auncient prerogatiue of manhoode doe chalenge the first fronte in eache bat∣taile, from the inhabitants of other countries: So the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of their <HI>shyre,</HI> ought by good congruence to be preferred before the rest of the <HI>Byshops</HI> of the whole Realme. Moreouer, whereas before time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arche∣bishoppes place in the generall counsell.</NOTE> the place of this <HI>Archebishop</HI> in the generall Counsell, was to sit next to the <HI>Bishop</HI> of sainct <HI>Ruffines, Anselmus</HI> (the Successour of this <HI>Lanfranc</HI>) for recompence of the good seruice that hee had done, in ruffling againste <HI>Priestes</HI> wyues, and resisting the <HI>King</HI> for the inuestiture of clerkes) was by <HI>Pope Vrbane</HI> endowed with this ac∣cession <MILESTONE N="1099"/> of honour, that hee and his successours, should frō thencefoorth haue place in all generall counsels, at the <HI>Popes</HI> right foote, who then said withall, <HI>Includamus hunc in orbe nostro, tanquam alterius orbis Papam.</HI></P>
<P>And thus the <HI>Archebishops</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by the fraude of <HI>Augustine,</HI> by the power of <HI>Lanfranc,</HI> and by the industrie of <HI>Anselme,</HI> were muche exalted: but how much that was to the greeuous displeasure, and pining
<PB N="66" REF="47"/> enuie, of the <HI>Archbyshops</HI> of <HI>Yorke,</HI> you shall perceiue by that whiche followeth.</P>
<P><HI>King Henry</HI> the firste, kept (vpon a time) a stately <HI>Christmas</HI> at <HI>Windsore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wrastling for the pri∣macie.</NOTE> where (the maner of our <HI>kings</HI> then being at certeine solemne times to weare their <HI>crownes) Thurstine</HI> of <HI>Yorke</HI> (hauing his crosse borne vp before him) offered to set the crowne vpon the <HI>kings</HI> head: But <HI>William</HI> of Canterbury withstoode it stout∣ly, and so preuayled by the fauoure of the king, and the helpe of the standers by, that <HI>Thurstine</HI> was not onely disappointed of his purpose, but he (and his crosse also) thrust cleane out of the doores.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> of <HI>Yorke</HI> (the next in succession after <HI>Thur∣stine,</HI> both in the Sée and Quarell) perceiuing that the force of his predecessor preuayled nothing, attempted by his own humble meanes (first made to the <HI>king,</HI> and af∣ter to the <HI>Pope</HI>) to winne the coronation of king <HI>Henry</HI> <MILESTONE N="1155"/> the seconde, from <HI>Theobald</HI> the nexte <HI>Archbyshop</HI> of Canterbury: But when he had receiued repulse in that sort of suite also, and found no way left to make auenge∣ment vpon his enemie, he returned home al wrothe, and (mixing poyson in the chalice, at his <HI>Masse</HI>) wreaked the anger vpon himselfe.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1178"/> After this, another hurley burley happened in a <HI>Sy∣node,</HI> assembled at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the time of king <HI>Henry</HI> the second, before Cardinal <HI>Hugo,</HI> (Pope <HI>Alex∣anders</HI> Legate) betwéen <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Roger,</HI> then Arch∣bishops of these two Sées vpon occasion, that <HI>Roger</HI> of York comming of purpose (as it should séeme) first to the assembly, had taken vp the place on the right hande of the Cardinall, which when <HI>Richard</HI> of Canterbury had espyed, he refused to sit downe in the second roome, com∣playning greatly of this preiudice done to his Sée: wher∣vpon, after sundry replies of speache, the weaker in dis∣putation
<PB N="67" REF="47"/> (after the maner of shrewd schole boyes in Lō∣don streats) descended frō hote words, to hastie blowes, in which encounter, the <HI>Archbyshop</HI> of Canterburie (through the multitude of his meiney) obteined the bet∣ter: So that he not onely plucked the other out of his place, and (trampling vpon his body with his his féete) al to rent and tare his <HI>Casule, Chimer,</HI> and <HI>Rochet,</HI> but also disturbed the holy <HI>Synode</HI> therwithal, in suche wise that the Cardinall for feare, betooke him to his féete, the company departed their businesse vndone, and the By∣shops themselues moued suite at <HI>Rome,</HI> for the finishing of their controuersie. By these, &amp; such other successes, on the one side, the Byshops of Canterburie following, tooke suche courage, that from thencefoorth, they woulde not permit the Byshops of <HI>Yorke</HI> to beare vp the crosse, either in their presence, or prouince: And on the other side, the Byshops of Yorke conceiued suche griefe of heart, disdaine, and offence, that from time to time, they spared no occasion to attempt both the one &amp; the other.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1268"/> Wherevpon, in the time of a <HI>Parleament,</HI> holden at <HI>Londō,</HI> in the reigne of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the third, <HI>Boniface</HI> (Archbishop of Canterbury) interdicted the <HI>Londoners,</HI> bycause they had suffered the Byshop of Yorke to beare vp his crosse whiles he was in the citie. And much to doe there was (within a few yeeres after) betwéene <HI>Robert Kylwarby</HI> of Canterburie, and <HI>Walter Giffard</HI> of Yorke, bycause he of Yorke aduaunced his crosse, as he passed through <HI>Kent</HI> towardes the generall Coun∣sell.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1272"/> The like happened also, at two other seuerall times, betwéene Friar <HI>Peckam</HI> (Archebyshop of Canterburie) and <HI>William Winkewane,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the strife for the supre∣macie.</NOTE> and <HI>Iohn de Roma</HI> (Archby∣shops of Yorke) in the dayes of King <HI>Edwarde</HI> the firste. At the length, the matter being yet once more set on foote
<PB N="36" REF="48"/> betwéene <HI>Simon Islepe</HI> (the <HI>Archebishop</HI> of this coun∣trie) and his aduersarie (the incumbent of <HI>Yorke</HI> for that time) <HI>King Edward</HI> the third, in whose reigne that variance was reuined, resumed the matter into his owne hande, and made a finall composition betwéene them, the which he published vnder his broade seale to this effect: first, that eache of them should fréely, and without empeachement of the other, beare vp his crosse in the others <HI>Prouince,</HI> but yet so, that he of <HI>Yorke</HI> and his successours for euer, in signe of subiection, should within two monethes after their inthronization, either bring, or sende, to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Image of an <HI>Arche∣bishop</HI> bearing a crosse, or some other Iewell wrought in fine golde, to the value of fourtie poundes, and offer it openly there vpon Sainct <HI>Thomas Beckets</HI> shryne: then, that in all <HI>Synodes</HI> of the clergie, and assemblies where the <HI>King</HI> should happen to be present, he of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> should haue the right hand, and the other the lefte: finally, that in broade streetes, and highe wayes, their crossebearers should go togeather, but that in nar∣rowe lanes, and in the entries of doores and gates, the crossier of <HI>Canterbury</HI> should go before, and the other followe, and come behinde.</P>
<P>So that (as you sée) the <HI>Bishoppes</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> e∣uermore preuayling by fauour and obstinacie, they of <HI>Yorke</HI> were driuen in the end, to giue ouer in the plain field, for very dispaire, wanhope, and weerinesse.</P>
<P>But heare by the way, I woulde faine, for my lear∣ning, knowe of these godly Fathers, or rather (since themselues can not now make answer) of some of their vngodly fauourers, whether this their <HI>Helena,</HI> this crosse (for the bearing whereof they contended so long, and so bitterly, that a man might doubt with the <HI>Poet, <HI>Peceat vter Cruce dignius</HI></HI>) whether (I say) it were exal∣ted,
<PB N="37" REF="48"/> as the signe of that Crosse whereon <HI>Christ</HI> trium∣phed ouer the Diuel, or els but for a flagge and antsigne of their owne pride, whereby they sought to triumphe and insult the one ouer the other? And againe, if it were <HI>Christes</HI> crosse, then why they did forbid it to bee aduaunced, at any time, by any person, or in any place? Or if it were but their owne, then why they did, and yet doe, commaund vs simple soules, not only with greate humilitie, but with diuine honour also, to prostrate our selues, and to adore it? I am sure they may be ashamed to affirme it to bee the one, &amp; I thinke they wilbe asha∣med to confesse it to be the other. I wil ceasse therfore to vrge it any further, &amp; wil prosecute the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of the <HI>Archebishoppes</HI> of this <HI>See,</HI> since the arriual of <HI>Augus∣tine.</HI> In the which, the first seuen, be of that number which <HI>Pope Gregorie</HI> sent hither out of <HI>Italie:</HI> The next twentie thrée, and <HI>Stigande,</HI> were <HI>Saxons:</HI> all the residue, <HI>Normanes</HI> &amp; <HI>Englishmen.</HI> And bycause there is some variance as touching the times of their conti∣nuance and sitting, I purpose to shew (vnder one view) the opinion of two sundrie authours, so farre foorth as they haue spoken therof, that is to say, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Mal∣mesbury,</HI> and an auncient <HI>Chronicler</HI> of <HI>Couen∣trie,</HI> (whose name I haue not hytherto learned) and in the residue to follow our owne late and receaued writers.</P>

<P>Thus haue you the succession of seuentie Archbishops, in the recital whereof, I doe (of purpose) spare to dispute the variance arising amongst writers, as touching the continuance, &amp; true times of their gouernment, whiche discrepance, groweth partly, for the defaulte of the au∣ctors themselues, not obseruing the due accompte of yeares, and partly by the vnskil of suche as haue vntru∣ly copied out their woorkes: I willingly reserue also for other places, sundrie the hystories of their liues and do∣inges, bothe bicause I thinke it fruitlesse, to reconcile suche manner of disagréements, and also, for that (as I saide before of the Kings) I déeme it impertinent to my purpose, to speake further of any thing, then the very place in hand, shall iustly giue me occasion.</P>
<P>It followeth therefore, that according to promise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ordre of this de∣scription of Kent.</NOTE> I handle suche particular places within this Diocese, as are mentioned in hystorie, in whiche treatie, I will ob∣serue this order. First to begin at <HI>Tanet,</HI> and to peruse the East and Southe shores, til I come to the limits, be∣twéen this Shyre, &amp; <HI>Sussex:</HI> then to ascend <HI>Northward,</HI> and to visits such places, as lye along the bounds of this Diocess &amp; <HI>Rochester,</HI> returning by the mouth of <HI>Med∣wey</HI> to <HI>Tanet</HI> again, whiche is the whole circuite of this Bishopricke: and lastly, to describe suche places, as lye in the body and midest of the same.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Tanet, called in Brytish, Inis</HI> Rhuo∣chym, of the Shore Rutupi: it is named of some <HI>writers, in Latine (or rather Greeke) Thana∣tos,</HI> in Saxon, tenet, in <HI>stead of</HI> ƿaenet.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No snakes in Tanet.</NOTE><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Vlius Solinus</HI> (in his description of <HI>England</HI>) saith thus of <HI>Tanet: <HI>Thana∣natos nullo serpitur angue, &amp; asportata inde terra angues necat.</HI></HI> There be no snakes in <HI>Tanet</HI> (saith he) &amp; the earth that is brought from thence will kill them. But whether he wrote this of any sure vnderstanding that he had of the quality of the soyle, or onely by coniecture at the woord <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which in Gréeke signifieth death, or killing, I wote not, &amp; much lesse dare I determine, bycause hitherto neither I my selfe haue heard of any Region hereabout (onely <HI>Ireland</HI> excepted) which beareth not both snakes and o∣ther venemous wormes, neither am I yet persuaded, that this place borowed the name out of the Gréeke, but rather tooke it of the propre language, of this oure natiue countrie: For <HI>ƿaenet,</HI> in the <HI>Saxon,</HI> or olde <HI>Eng∣glishe</HI> tongue, soundeth as muche as, moysted, or wa∣tered, whiche deriuation, howe well it standeth with the situation of <HI>Tanet,</HI> being <HI>Peninsula,</HI> and watered (in manner) round about, I had rather without reasoning, referre to euery mans iudgement, then by debate of many woordes, eyther to trouble the reader, or to in∣terrupt mine owne order.

<P>There lyeth (saieth <HI>Beda,</HI> speaking of the place, where King <HI>Ethelbert</HI> entertained <HI>Augustine</HI>) in the East part of <HI>Kent,</HI> an <HI>Iland,</HI> called <HI>Tanet,</HI> con∣teining (after the manner of the <HI>Englishe</HI> accompte) sixe hundred families, or <HI>Hides</HI> of land (as the <HI>Saxon</HI> booke of <HI>Beda</HI> hath) whiche be in deede after the opinion of auncient writers, plough landes: It is diuided from the continent, or mayne land, by the riuer called <HI>Want∣sume,</HI> whiche is about thrée furlongs broade, and to bee passed ouer in two places onely: Hereunto if you adde the opinion of <HI>Polydore,</HI> the description wilbe the more euident.

<P>Howbeit the <HI>Saxons</HI> themselues, after that in pro∣cesse of time, they had gotten the dominion ouer the <HI>Bri∣tons,</HI> enioyed not the possession of <HI>Tanet</HI> in much better quiet then the <HI>Britons</HI> had done before them.

<P>But, for asmuche as good order requireth, that I should tell you of the foundation, before I speake of the fall, you shall heare out of <HI>William Thorne,</HI> (one that made an appendix to the hystorie of <HI>Thomas Spot,</HI> both Monkes of Saint <HI>Augustines</HI>) the occasion of the first fabulous beginning of this Abbay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The occa∣sion of the building of Minster Ab¦bay.</NOTE>Certain seruaunts, or officers (saith he) of <HI>Egbright</HI> (the third King of <HI>Kent</HI> after <HI>Ethelbert</HI>) had done great iniurie to a noble woman (called <HI>Domneua,</HI> the mother of Saint <HI>Mildred</HI>) in recompence of whiche wrongs the King made an <HI>Herodian</HI> othe, and promised vpon <MILESTONE N="596"/> his honour, to giue her whatsoeuer she would aske him.</P>
<P>The woman (instructed belike by some Menkishe coun∣selour) begged of him so muche ground to build an Ab∣bay vpon, as a tame déere (y<SUP>t</SUP> she nourished) would runne
<PB N="81" REF="55"/> ouer at a breathe: Hereto the King had consented forth∣with, sauing that one <HI>Tymor</HI> (a counseler of his) stan∣ding by, blamed him of great inconsideration, for that he woulde vpon the vncertaine course of a Deare, departe to his certaine losse, with any part of so good a soyle, but the earth (sayth <HI>William Thorne</HI>) immediatly opened, and swalowed him aliue, in memorie whereof, the place till his time, was called <HI>Tymor sleape.</HI> Well, the King and this Gentlewoman procéeded in their bargaine, the Hynde was put foorth, and it ranne the quantitie of fourtie and eight ploughlands, before it returned.</P>
<P>And thus <HI>Domneua</HI> (by the help of the King) builded at <HI>Mynster</HI> (within that precinct) a Monasterie of Non∣nes, vpon suche like discretion, (you may be sure) as <HI>Ramsey</HI> Abbay was pitched, euen where a Bull by chaunce scraped with his foote, and as <HI>Rome</HI> it selfe (for whose fauour these follies be deuised) was edified, where the she Woulfe gaue <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus</HI> sucke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">For it was called Ro∣ma, of Ru∣ma, a pappe or dugge.</NOTE></P>
<P>Ouer this Abbay, <HI>Mildred</HI> (of whome we spake) the daughter of <HI>Meruaile,</HI> (that was sonne to <HI>Penda,</HI> King of <HI>midle England</HI>) became the Lady and Abbasse: who bicause she was of noble linage, and had gotten together <MILESTONE N="680"/> seuentie women, (all whiche <HI>Theodorus</HI> the seuenth Bishop) veiled for Nonnes, she easily obteyned to be re∣gistred in our Englishe Kalender, &amp; to be worshipped for a Saint, both at <HI>Tanet,</HI> while her body lay there, and at <HI>S.

<P>And this (no doubte) was the cause, that the Religi∣ous persons of <HI>S. Augustines,</HI> and of <HI>S.

<P>Howsoeuer that were, they bothe made marchan∣dize of her myracles, and the Monkes of <HI>S Augustines</HI> perceiuing, that by the dissolution of the Monasterie, and the absence of the Saintes, their towne of <HI>Minster,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1116"/> in <HI>Tanet</HI> was falne to decay, of verie conscience, and for pities sake, by the meane of <HI>Hughe</HI> their Abbat, procu∣red at the handes of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the first, the graunt of a Market, to be holden there, whiche I wote not whe∣ther it inioyeth to this day, or no.</P>

<HEAD>The Goodwine, or Good∣vvine Sandes.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here liued in the time of King <HI>Edwarde</HI> (commonly called the <HI>Confessour</HI>) a no∣ble mā,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earle God∣wine and his sonnes.</NOTE> named <HI>Godwine,</HI> whose daugh∣ter <HI>Edgithe,</HI> the same King, by great in∣stance of his nobilitie, (being otherwise of him selfe disposed to haue liued sole) tooke vnto his wife. By reason whereof, not onely this <HI>Godwine</HI> him selfe (being at the first but a Cowheards sonne, and afterward aduaunced to honour by King <HI>Ca∣nutus,</HI> whose sister by fraude he obteined to wife) became of great power and authoritie within this Realme (but his sonnes also being fiue in nomber) were by the kings <MILESTONE N="1050"/> gyfte, aduaunced to large liuelyhoodes and honourable possessions. For <HI>Goodwine</HI> was Earle of <HI>Kent, Sus∣sex, Hamshire, Dorsetshire, Deuonshire,</HI> and <HI>Cornwal:</HI> His eldest sonne <HI>Swane,</HI> had <HI>Oxfordshire, Barkeshire Gloucestershire, Herefordshire,</HI> and <HI>Somerset: Harold,</HI> helde <HI>Essex, Norfolk, Suffolke, Cambridgeshire,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hun∣tingdonshire: Tosti,</HI> had <HI>Northumberland:</HI> And <HI>Gurte,</HI> &amp; <HI>Leoswine,</HI> possessed other places. &amp;c. But as it is hard in great prosperitie to kéepe due temperance, for, <HI>Super∣bia est vitium rebus solenne secundis:</HI> So this man and his sonnes, being puffed vp with the pryde of the Kings fa∣uour, their owne power, pollicie, and possession, contem∣ned all other, and forgate them selues, abusing the sim∣plicitie of the King by euill counsel, treading vnder foote the nobilitie by great disdaine, and oppressing the com∣mon people by insatiable rauine, extortion, and tirannie. So that immediatly, and at once, they pulled vpon their heades, the heauie displeasure of the Prince, the immor∣tall hatred of the noble men, and the bitter execration
<PB N="88" REF="57"/> and curse of the common sort. Whereupon the king for a season banished them, the nobles neuer after liked them, and the poore people not onely railed vpon them while they liued, but also by deuised tales (as the man∣ner is) laboured to make them hatefull to all posteritie after their death. And amongst other things, touching <HI>Godwyne</HI> him selfe, they feygned, that he was choked at <HI>Winchester</HI> (or <HI>Windsore,</HI> as others say, for liers can not lightly agrée) with a morsel of bread, and that this his land in <HI>Kent</HI> sonke sodainly into the <HI>Sea.</HI> Neyther were these things continued in memory, by the mouths of the vnlearned people only, but committed to writing also, by the hands and pens of Monkes, Frears, and o∣thers of the learned sort. So that in course of time, the matter was past all peraduenture, and the things belie∣ued for vndoubted veritie.</P>
<P>But whatsoeuer hath bene heretofore thought of these matters, hauing now iust occasion offered mee to treate of the thing, I wil not spare, to speake that which I haue red in some credible writers, and whiche I doe <MILESTONE N="1100"/> thinke méete to be beléeued of all indifferent readers.</P>
<P><HI>Siluester Giraldus</HI> (in his <HI>Itinerarie</HI> of <HI>Wales</HI>) and many others, doe write,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of Good∣wyn Sandes</NOTE> that about the end of the reigne of King <HI>William Rufus,</HI> (or the beginning of <HI>Henrie</HI> the first) there was a sodaine and mightie inundation of the <HI>Sea,</HI> by the which a great part of <HI>Flaunders,</HI> and of the lowe countries thereabout, was drenched, and lost, so that many of the inhabitants (being thereby expulsed from their seates) came ouer into <HI>England,</HI> and made suite to the same King <HI>Henrie,</HI> for some place of dwel∣ling within his dominion. The King pitying their cala∣mitie, and séeing that they might bee profitable to his Realme, by instructing his people in the art of clothing, (wherein at that time they chiefly excelled,) first placed
<PB N="86" REF="58"/> them about <HI>Carlile</HI> in the <HI>North</HI> countrie, and after∣warde (vpon cause) remoued them to <HI>Rosse</HI> and <HI>Hauer∣ford</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> Now at the same tyme that this hap∣pened in <HI>Flaunders,</HI> the like harme was done in sundry places, bothe of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> also, (as <HI>Hector Boethius,</HI> the <HI>Scottishe</HI> hystoriographer, moste plainly writeth) affirming, that (amongst other) this place, being sometyme of the possession of the Earle <HI>Godwine,</HI> was then first violently ouerwhelmed with a light sande, wherewith it, not onely remayneth couered euer since, but is become withall <HI>(Nauium gurges, &amp; vorago)</HI> a most dreadfull gulfe, and shippe swalower.</P>
<P>This thing, as I cannot but marueil how it hath es∣caped the penns of our own countrie writers (the rather for that some of them liuing about that time) haue men∣tion of that harme in the lowe countrie: so I sticke not to accept it for assured trueth, considering either the au∣ctority of the writer him selfe, being a diligent and lear∣ned man, or the circumstances of the thing that he hathe left written, beeing in it selfe both reasonable, &amp; likely.</P>
<P>And thus I might wel make an end, but because I haue alredy takē occasiō to accuse thē of forgerie, which affirme <HI>Godwine</HI> to haue bene choked at the bourde, I trust it shalbe no great offence, (though beside purpose, yet for declaration of the trueth) to rehearse shortly, what some credible storiers haue reported of that mat∣ter also. And to the end that the trueth may appeare by collation of the diuers reportes, I will first shewe what the common opinion and tale of his death is, and then afterward what these other men write concerning the same.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Earle Godwyne.</NOTE> <HI>Ealred,</HI> the Abbat of <HI>Ryuauxe,</HI> (who tooke paynes to pen the hystorie of the same King <HI>Edwardes</HI> whole life, and of whom all others (as I thinke) lear∣ned this tale, saith: that while the King and <HI>Godwyne</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="58"/> sate at the table, accompanied with others of the Nobi∣litie, it chaunced the Cupbearer (as he brought wyne to the bourd) to slip with the one foote, and yet by good strength of his other legge, to recouer him self without falling, whiche thing the <HI>Earle</HI> earnestly marking, sayde pleasantly, that <HI>There, one brother had wel helped an∣other: mary</HI> (quoth the King) <HI>so might me mine, ne had∣dest thou bene Earle Godwine:</HI> casting in his dishe the murder of his brother <HI>Alfred,</HI> which was done to death at <HI>Elie</HI> by the counsell of <HI>Godwine,</HI> as hereafter in fitte place for it shall appeare. Hereat the <HI>Earle</HI> was sore moued, and thinking it more then time to make his pur¦gation, tooke a morsell of bread into his hand, and praying (with great and vehement obtestation) that it might choke him, if he by any meanes caused y<SUP>e</SUP> slaugh∣ter or consēted thereto, he put the bread into his mouth, and was immediatly strangled therewithall.</P>
<P>Some write, that this bread was before accursed by <HI>Wulstane,</HI> the holy Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> after a certain manner then vsed, &amp; called <HI>Corsned,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cursed bread.</NOTE> as in the table to y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Saxons</HI> lawes is to be séene. But this <HI>Ealred</HI> affirmeth that after the woords spoken by the Earle, the King him selfe blessed the bread with the signe of the crosse: And therfore these men agrée aswel together, as blessing and cursing be one like to another.</P>
<P>But letting that and them passe, heare (I beséech you) what <HI>Alfred</HI> of <HI>Beuerley</HI> (a learned man, that liued in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, somewhat before this Abbat <HI>Ealred</HI>) saith, touching this matter. <HI>Godwinus gra∣ui morbo ex improuiso percussus, ac Regi ad mensam Wyntoniae assidens, mutus in ipsa sede declinauit, ac postea in camerā Re∣gis a filijs deportatus, moritur. Quidam autem dicunt. &amp;c. <HI>Godwine</HI></HI> being sodainly strickē w<SUP>t</SUP> a grieuous disease, as he sate at y<SUP>e</SUP> table with the King at <HI>Winchester,</HI> fel down
<PB N="85" REF="59"/> from his stoole, and was carried by his sonnes into the Kings chamber, where he dyed: but some say that he was choked &amp;c. And to the same effect writeth <HI>Maria∣nus</HI> the <HI>Scot. Simeon</HI> also, the Chaunter of <HI>Durham,</HI> whiche liued about the time of this <HI>Alfred,</HI> or rather before him, treating of this matter, hath these wordes.</P>
<P><HI>Godwinus graui morbo percussus, in ipsa sede declinauit, &amp; post horas quinque moritur. <HI>Godwyne</HI></HI> being taken with a grieuous disease, dropped down from the place where he sate, and dyed within fiue houres after.</P>
<P>Thus these men reporte another manner of his death, the one vsing no mention at all of any accursed breade, and the other reciting it but as a tale. And for the more plaine detection of the deceipt of this Abbat, he that wil read the second booke of <HI>William Malmes. <HI>De Regibus,</HI></HI> shall finde, that the occasion, and introduction of this matter (I meane, the slipping of the Kings Cupbearer, and the speache that procéeded therof, namely, that <HI>One brother had wel helped another</HI>) is woorde for woord stollen from thence, for <HI>William</HI> (whiche liued before <HI>E∣alred</HI>) reporteth, that king <HI>Ethelstane,</HI> by persuasion of one that was his cupbearer, had banished <HI>Eadwine</HI> his owne brother, for suspicion of treason, and had com∣mitted him to the Seas and windes in an olde, shaken, and fraile vessel, without saile, oare, or companion, (saue one Esquier only,) in whiche exile he perished, and that afterward the King (vnderstanding his brothers inno∣cencie, and sorowing his owne rashnesse) tooke occasion by sight of his cupbearers foote slipping, to be auenged of the false accusation, euen as it is here tolde of King <HI>Edward.</HI> But <HI>Ealred,</HI> forsoothe, was so fully disposed to magnifie King <HI>Edward</HI> (bycause he so muche magnified the Monkishe and single life) that he sticked not at grea∣ter matters then this, affirming boldely that the same

<P>Thus muche I recite out of <HI>Bracton,</HI> partly to shew that <HI>Shipwey</HI> was before King <HI>Edward</HI> the firsts time, the place of assembly for the Plees of the <HI>Fiue Portes,</HI> partly to notifie the difference, and controuersie that long since was betweene these <HI>Portes,</HI> and those other townes: But purposely and chiefely to proue, that <HI>Hastings,</HI> and <HI>Hithe, Douer, Rumney,</HI> and <HI>Sand∣wiche,</HI> were in <HI>Bractons</HI> time, accompted the <HI>Fiue</HI> prin∣cipall hauens or <HI>Portes,</HI> whiche were endowed with priuiledge.</P>
<P>Neither yet will I deny, but that soone after, <HI>Win∣chelsey</HI> and <HI>Rye</HI> might be added to the number. <MILESTONE N="1268"/></P>
<P>For I finde in an olde recorde, that King <HI>Henrie</HI> the third tooke into his owne handes (for the better defence of the Realme) the townes of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> and <HI>Rye,</HI> whiche belonged before to the Monasterie of <HI>Fescampe</HI> in <HI>Normandie,</HI> &amp; gaue therfore in exchaunge, the Manor of <HI>Chiltham</HI> in <HI>Gloucester shyre,</HI> &amp; diuers other landes in <HI>Lincolne shyre:</HI> This he did, partly to conceale from the <HI>Priors Aliens,</HI> the intelligence of the secrete affairs of his Realme, &amp; partly bycause of a great disobedience
<PB N="96" REF="63"/> and excesse, that was committed by the inhabitants of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> against Prince <HI>Edward</HI> his eldest Sonne. And therefore, although, I can easely be led to thinke, y<SUP>t</SUP> he submitted them for their correction to the order, and gouernance of the <HI>Fiue Portes,</HI> yet I stand doubtfull whether he made them partners of their priuiledges, or no,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Winchel∣sey first builded.</NOTE> for that had been a preferment, and no punishment: but I suspect rather, that his Sonne King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, (by whose encouragement and aide, olde <HI>Winchel∣sey</HI> <MILESTONE N="1277"/> was afterward abandoned, and the now Towne buidled) was the first that appareiled them wyth that preeminence.</P>
<P>By this therefore let it appeare, that <HI>Hastings, Do∣uer, Hithe, Rumney,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sandwiche,</HI> were the first Ports of priuiledge, which (bycause they were <HI>Fiue</HI> in numbre) bothe at the first gaue, and yet continue, to all the resi∣due, the name of <HI>Cinque Portes,</HI> although not onely <HI>Winchelsey</HI> and <HI>Rye,</HI> be since that time, incorporated with them as principals, but diuers other places also (for the ease of their charge) be crept in as partes, lims, and members of the same. Now therefore, somewhat shalbe saide, as touching the seruices that these <HI>Portes</HI> of duetie owe, and in déed haue done, to the Princes: wherof the one (I meane with what numbre of vessels, in what manner of furniture, and for howe long season, they ought to waite on the King at the Sea, vpon theyr owne charges) shall partly appeare by that whiche wée shall presently say, and partly by that whiche shall fol∣low in <HI>Sandwiche,</HI> and <HI>Rumney:</HI> The other shalbe made manifest by examples, drawn out of good hystories: and bothe shalbe testified by the woordes of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first in his owne Chartre.</P>
<P>The booke of Domesday before remembred, chargeth <HI>Douer</HI> wyth 20. vessels at the Sea, whereof eache to be
<PB N="97" REF="63"/> furnished with one and twentie men, for fiftéene dayes together: and sayth further, that <HI>Rumney</HI> and <HI>Sand∣wiche</HI> aunswered the like seruice: But nowe whether this (like) ought to be vnderstoode of the like altogether, bothe in respect of the number and seruice, or of the (like) in respect of seruice, according to the proportion of their abilitie onely, I may not hereby take vpon me to deter∣mine, For on the one side, if <HI>Rumney, Sandwiche,</HI> and the residue, should likewise find twentie vessels a péece, then (as you shall anone sée) the <HI>fiue Portes</HI> were subiect to a greater charge at that time, then King <HI>Edward</HI> the first layd vpon them: And on the other side, if they were only chargeable after their proportion, then know I not howe far to burthen them, séeing the Record of <HI>Domes∣day</HI> it selfe, bindeth them to no certeintie. And therfore leauing this as I finde it, I must elsewhere make inqui∣sition for more lightsome proofe: And firste I will haue recourse to King <HI>Edwarde</HI> the firste his Chartre, in which I read, that <HI>At ech time that the King passeth o∣uer the sea, the Portes ought to rigge vp fiftie and seuen ships, (whereof euery one to haue twentie armed soul∣diers) and to mainteine them at their own costes, by the space of fifteene dayes together.</HI></P>
<P>And thus it stoode with the Portes for their generall charge, in the sixte yeare of his reigne, for then was this Chartre sealed: But as touching the particular bur∣then of eche one, I haue séene two diuers testimonies, of whiche the first is a note in Frenche (bearing the coun∣tenance of a Record) and is intituled, to haue bene renu∣ed in the two and twentie yeare of the Reigne of the same King, by <HI>Stephan Penchester,</HI> then Constable of <HI>Douer</HI> Castle, in whiche the particular charge is set downe in this manner.</P>

<P>Aboute the yeare after <HI>Christe,</HI> <MILESTONE N="787"/> seuen hundreth foure score and seuen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole hystorie of the Danishe doings in England.</NOTE> thrée vessels of the <HI>Northe East Countrie</HI> men (whose ancestors had before, within the compasse of one hundrethe and fourtie yeares, sacked <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>Italie</HI> foure seuerall times, and whose ofspring afterward wonne <HI>Normandie</HI> from the <HI>Frenche</HI> King) shewed them selues vpon the westerne shoare of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> being sent before hand (as it is supposed) to espie the cōmoditie of the hauens, the aduauntage of arriual, the wealthe and force of the inhabitants, &amp; to the end to
<PB N="108" REF="69"/> prepare the way for greater powers, then were appoin- to followe.</P>
<P>These had no sooner set some of their men on lande, but the <HI>Reeue,</HI> or officer or <HI>Beorhtricke,</HI> or <HI>Brictricke</HI> (then King of the West <HI>Saxons</HI>) had knowledge therof: who came vnto them, and demaunding the cause of their arriual) would haue carried them to the <HI>Kings</HI> pre¦sence, but they in their resistance slewe him, wherevpon the people of the Countrie adioyning, addressed them∣selues to reuenge, and assembling in great numbers, beate them backe to their ships, not without the losse of some of their company.</P>
<P>And this was the first attempt, that euer the <HI>Danes</HI> (for so our hystories cal by one general name, the <HI>Danes Norwais, Gottes, Vandals,</HI> &amp; others of that part) made vpon <HI>England:</HI> after whiche tyme, what horrible inua∣sions, miseries, calamities, and oppressions followed, shall appeare anone.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="795"/> Not long after this enterprise, a fewe ships of them, made the lyke assay in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and within short space after that also, some other of them entred <HI>Tynemouth</HI> Hauen in the North parte of <HI>England,</HI> and taking some small booties, retourned to their vessels.</P>
<P>Now by this experiment, they had gained sufficient knowledge of that, for whiche they first came, &amp; there∣fore thinking it fit tyme to assay further, they rigged vp a greater numbre of ships, armed more store of chosen souldiers, entred the Riuer of <HI>Thamise</HI> with fiue and thirtie sayle, landed in despight of the people, fired, spoy∣led, herried, and preuailed so farre, that <HI>Egbert</HI> (who <MILESTONE N="833"/> then had the <HI>Monarchie</HI> ouer all <HI>England</HI>) was faine to come with all his power to the reliefe and rescue.</P>
<P>But suche was the will of <HI>God</HI> (for the punishement of Idolatrie and superstition, which then ouerwhelmed
<PB N="109" REF="69"/> this Realme) that the <HI>Danes</HI> in stead of being discomfi∣ted by the Kings repaire, were merueilously encoura∣ged by his misfortune. For, after that they had once gotten the better in the field against him, they were so embouldened therby, that notwithstanding he after∣ward, and some other valiant Princes following, by great prowesse, abated their furie in parte, yet, adioy∣ning themselues to the <HI>Britons</HI> (that then were in great emnitie with the <HI>Saxons</HI>) and swarming hither out of their owne Countrie in such flightes, that the number of the slaine was continually supplied with greate ad∣uauntage, they neuer ceassed to infeste the Realme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conti∣nuance of the Danes, in England</NOTE> by the space of thrée hundreth yeares and more, during the reignes of fiftéene seuerall Kings, till at the last, they had made <HI>Etheldred</HI> flye ouer into <HI>Normandie,</HI> &amp; leaue them his Kingdome. During all whiche time, howe mightely their forces increased vnder <HI>Hinguar, Hubba, Halfden, Guthrum, Aulaf</HI> and <HI>Hasten,</HI> (their Nauie be∣ing rysen from thrée ships, to thrée hundrethe and fiftie at the least) howe pitiously the <HI>East, West, Southe,</HI> and <HI>Northe</HI> parts of the Realme were wasted (the townes, Cities, religious houses, and Monasteries of eache quar∣ter being consumed with flames) howe miserably the common people were afflictted, (men, women, and chil∣dren on all sides going to wracke, by their tempestuous furie) howe marueilously the Kings were amased, (the arriualles of these their enemies, being no lesse sudaine, then violent) howe barbarously the monuments of good learning were defaced, (the same suffering more by the immanitie of this one brutishe Nation, then by all the warres and conquestes of the <HI>Pictes,</HI> &amp; <HI>Scots, Romanes,</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI>) and finally, how furiously fire, and swoord, famine and pestilence, raged in euery place, <HI>God</HI> and men, Heauen and the elements conspiring (as it were)

<P>This man aboue all other, was so distressed by their continual inuasions, that since he wanted force to make his longer defence, he thought it best to giue money for their continuall peace. And therefore charging his people with importable tributes, he first gaue them, at fiue seuerall payes, 113000. l. &amp; afterward promised thē 48000. yearely: hoping that (for asmuch as they seemed by the manner of their warre, rather to séeke his coyne, then his kingdome, to rob, then to rule) at the least this way to haue satisfied their hunger: but like as the stone called, <HI>Syphinus,</HI> the more it is moisted, the harder it waxeth: so no giftes could quenche the golden thirste of these gréedie raueners, but the more was brought to ap¦pease them, the more stonie, and inexorable they shewed thēselues, neuer ceassing (euen against promises, othes, &amp; hostages) to execute their accustomed crueltie.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Danes, all slaine in one night.</NOTE>Herevpon King <HI>Etheldred,</HI> hauing nowe exhausted y<SUP>e</SUP> whole treasure of his Realme, and therefore more vna∣ble, then euer he was, either by power, or praier, to help himself, or to relieue his subiectes, determined by a fine policie (as he thought) to deliuer bothe the one and the other. For whiche purpose, by the aduise of one <HI>Huna,</HI> (the generall of his armie) he wrote letters to eache part of the Realme, commaunding, that vpon S. <HI>Brices</HI> <MILESTONE N="1012"/> day (which is the morowe after Sainct <HI>Martins</HI> night) the Englishe men should all at once set vpon the <HI>Danes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint Mar∣tins drunkē feast.</NOTE> before they had disgested the surfaite of that drunken solemnitie, and so vtterly kyll and destroy them.

<PB N="111" REF="70"/> spéede and celeritie, that the <HI>Danes</HI> were sodainly, &amp; in a manner wholly, bothe men, women, and children (like the Sonnes in Lawe of <HI>Danaus</HI>) oppressed at once in a night: only a fewe escaped by Sea into <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and there made complaint of King <HI>Etheldreds</HI> boucherie.</P>
<P>For reuenge whereof, <HI>Sweyn</HI> their King, bothe armed <MILESTONE N="1013"/> his owne people, &amp; waged forreigne aide, and so (prepa∣ring a houge armie) tooke shipping, and arriued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweyn the Dane.</NOTE> first here at <HI>Sandwiche,</HI> and after in the <HI>Northe</HI> Countrie: the terrour of whose comming was suche, that it cau∣sed the Countrie people on all sides, to submitte them selues vnto him, in so muche, that King <HI>Etheldred,</HI> sée∣ing the cause desperate, and him selfe destitute, fled ouer into <HI>Normandie</HI> with his wife, and children, friendes, &amp; <MILESTONE N="1014"/> familie: After whiche his departure, although both he him selfe returned, and put <HI>Canutus</HI> (the next King of the <HI>Danes</HI>) to flight: and <HI>Edmund</HI> his Sonne also fought sundrie great battailes with him, yet the <HI>Danes</HI> preuai∣led so mightely vpon them, that thrée of them in successi∣on, (that is to say, <HI>Canutus, Haroldus,</HI> and <HI>Hardicanu∣tus</HI>) reigned Kings here in <HI>England</HI> almoste by the space of thirtie yeares together: so muche to the infamous op∣pression, slauery, and thraldome of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, that euery <HI>Dane</HI> was (for feare) called <HI>Lord Dane,</HI> and had at his commaundement, wheresoeuer he became, bothe man and wyfe, and whatsoeuer else he found in the house.

<P>And nowe thus muche summarily being saide, as con∣cerning the trueth of the <HI>Danes</HI> being here, who ruled in this land almoste thirtie yeares, and raged (without all rule) aboue three hundreth and fiftie: I will returne to <HI>Sandwiche,</HI> disclosing therein suche occurrents of the <HI>Danishe</HI> doings, as perteine to my purpose.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="851"/> In the yeare eight hundreth, fiftie, and one, after <HI>Christ, Athelstane</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Ethelwulfe,</HI> &amp; King of <HI>Kent</HI> (whome <HI>Mathewe</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> taketh, or ra∣ther mistaketh, for a Bishop) fought at the Sea before <HI>Sandwiche,</HI> against a great Nauie of the <HI>Danes,</HI> of whiche he tooke nine vessels, &amp; discomfited the residue.</P>
<P>Against another Fléete of the <HI>Danes</HI> whiche landed <MILESTONE N="1006"/> at <HI>Sandwiche</HI> in the yeare one thousand and sixe, King <HI>Etheldred</HI> made this prouision:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prouision of armour.</NOTE> that euerie thrée hun∣dreth and ten <HI>Hydes</HI> of Land (whiche <HI>Henrie Hunting∣don, Mathewe Parise,</HI> and others, expound to be so ma∣ny plowlands) should be charged with the furniture of one ship, and euery eight <HI>Hydes</HI> should finde one iacke and sallet, for the defence of the Realme: By whiche meane, he made redy a mighty nauie to the Sea: But what through the iniurie of sudaine tempest, and what <MILESTONE N="1014"/> by the defection of some of his Nobilitie, he profited no∣thing.

<P>The same man, at his returne hither tooke land, with his power at this towne: and so did <HI>Hardicanutus,</HI> his sonne after him.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in the dayes of King <HI>Edward</HI> the con∣fessour, <MILESTONE N="1060"/> two Princes, (or rather principall Pirates) of the <HI>Danes,</HI> called <HI>Lochen,</HI> and <HI>Irlinge,</HI> landed at <HI>Sand∣wiche,</HI> and laded their ships with riche spoyle, where∣with they crossed ouer the seas to <HI>Flaunders,</HI> and there made money of it.

<P>Finally, in the reigne of King <HI>Richard</HI> the seconde, certeine <HI>Frenche</HI> ships were taken at the Sea, whereof some were fraught with the frame of a timber Castle (suche another, I suppose, as <HI>Williā</HI> the Conquerour erected at <HI>Hastings,</HI> so soone as he was arriued) whiche they also ment to haue planted in some place of this Realme, for our anoyaunce: but they failed of their pur∣pose, for the Engyne being taken from them, it was set vp at this Towne, &amp; vsed to our great safe∣tie, and their repulse.</P>

They met accordingly, and marched
<PB N="123" REF="76"/> by darke night toward the Castell, well furnished with scaling ladders, but by reason that the watch had discri∣ed them, they not only fayled of that whiche they inten∣ded, but also fell into that whiche they neuer feared: for the Souldiours within the Castell (to whome <HI>Odo</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Borieux,</HI> and <HI>Hughe Mountfort,</HI> which then were with the King in <HI>Normandie,</HI> had committed the charge thereof) kept them selues close, and suffered the assaylants to approche the wall, and then, whiles they disorderly attempted to scale it, they set wide open their gates, and made a soudaine salie out of the péece, and set vpon them with suche furie, that they compelled <HI>Eu∣stace</HI> with a fewe others, to returne to his Shippe, the reste of his companie, béeing eyther slayne by the sworde, destroyed by fall from the Clyffe, or deuoured by the Sea.</P>

Amongst other his practises, hauing gotten into his handes, the reuenues of the Archebishopricke of <HI>Yorke</HI> (whereof <HI>Godfrey,</HI> the Kings brother was then elected Bishop, and busie at <HI>Rome</HI> for to obtaine his consecration) and fearing that by his returne, he might be defrauded of so swéete a morsell, he first laboured earnestly to hinder him in his suite at <HI>Rome,</HI> and when he sawe no successe of that attempt, he determined to make him sure, when soeuer he should returne home. And for that purpose, he tooke order with one <HI>Clere,</HI> (then Sheriffe of <HI>Kent,</HI> and
<PB N="131" REF="80"/> Constable of the castel of <HI>Douer,</HI> to whom he had giuen his sister in marriage) that he should haue a diligent eye to his arriuall, and that so soone as the Archebishop did set foote on lande, he shoulde strip him of all his orna∣ments, and commit him to safe custodie within the Ca∣stell. Whiche thing was done accordingly: for the Archebishop was no sooner arriued, and entered the Churche, to offer to <HI>Sainct Martine,</HI> sacrifice for his safe passage (as the Gentiles that escaped shipwracke, were wont to doe to <HI>Neptune:</HI>) But <HI>Clere</HI> and his compa∣nie came in vpon him, and doing the <HI>Chancellours</HI> commaundement, violently haled him and his Chap∣laines to prison.</P>
<P>Hereat <HI>Iohn</HI> (then the Kings brother, but afterward King) taking iust offence, and adioyning to him for re∣uenge, the vttermost aide of the Bishops and Barons, his friendes and alies, raised a great power, and in short time so strengthened the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> that he not only agreed to release <HI>Godfrey,</HI> but was fayne him selfe also (abandoning his late pompe and glorie) to get him to <HI>Douer,</HI> and lye with his brother <HI>Clere,</HI> as a poore, pri∣uate, and despoyled person.</P>
<P>Howbeit, not thus able to endure long, the note of infamie and confusion, whereinto he was falne, he de∣termined within him self to make an escape, and by shift of the place, to shroud his shame, in some corner beyond the Seas: And therfore, shaueing his face, and attyring him selfe like a woman, he tooke a péece of linnen vnder his arme, and a yard in his hand, minding by that disgui∣sing, to haue taken vessell amongst other passingers vn∣known, &amp; so to haue gotten ouer: But he was not at the first, in al his authoritie, more vnlike a good man, thē he was now in this poore apparel vnlike an honest womā:

And thus was all the gaye glorie of this gallant brought to shame and confusion, his Pecockes feathers pulled, his black féete bewraied, his fraude vnfoulded, his might abated, and him selfe in the ende suffered to sayle ouer with sorowe and ignominie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious houses in Douer.</NOTE> Besides this Pryorie of <HI>S.

<P>After the death of <HI>Hubert</HI> (the Archebishop of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>) the Monkes of <HI>Christes</HI> Church agréed among <MILESTONE N="1205"/> them selues to chose for their Bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope and king Iohn fall our for Ste∣phan Lang∣ton.</NOTE> <HI>Reginald</HI> the Subpryor of their house.

Some part of the Monkes, taking soudaine offence at <HI>Reginalde</HI> (for that he had disclosed a secrete out of their house) and being glad to satisfie the Kings desire, elected this <HI>Graye</HI> for their Bishop also.</P>
<P>Hereof grewe a great suite at <HI>Rome,</HI> betwéen the more part of the Monkes on the one side, and the Suffraganes of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the lesse number of the Monkes on the other side.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pope</HI> (vpon the hearing of the cause) at the first ratifieth the election of <HI>Iohn Graye:</HI> Howbeit after∣warde he refuseth bothe the electes, and preferreth <HI>Ste∣phan Langton,</HI> whom the Monkes (bycause the matter was not before litigious enough) elected also.</P>
<P>Nowe King <HI>Iohn,</HI> hearing, that not only the election of <HI>Graye</HI> (contrarie to the <HI>Popes</HI> owne former determi∣nation) was made frustrate, but that there was also thruste into his place a man familiarly entertained by
<PB N="134" REF="82"/> the <HI>Frenche</HI> King (his great enemie) disliked much of the choice, &amp; forbad <HI>Stephan</HI> the elect, to enter the Realme: The <HI>Pope</HI> againe, who (as <HI>Mathewe Parise</HI> writeth) sought chiefly in this his choice, <HI>Virum strenuum,</HI> a stoute man, that is (in plaine speache) a man that could exact of the Clergie, kéep in awe the Laitie, and encounter the King and Nobilitie) séeing his champion thus reiected, be¦ginneth to startle for anger: first therefore, he moueth the King by minacing letters to admitte <HI>Stephan,</HI> &amp; (not so preuailing) he enterditeth him, &amp; his whole Realme: And finally, bothe prouoketh al Potentates to make o∣pen warre vpon him, and also promiseth to the King of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> full and frée remission of all his sinnes, and the kingdome of <HI>England</HI> it self, to inuade him: this done, he solliciteth to rebellion the Bishops, nobilitie, and cōmōs of the Realme, loosing thē (by the plenitude of his Apos- to like power) from al duetie of allegiaunce toward their Prince. By this meanes diuine seruice ceassed, the King of <HI>Fraunce</HI> armed, the Bishops conspired, the nobi∣litie made defection, and the common people wauered, vncertaine to what part to incline: To be short, King <HI>Iohn</HI> was so pressed with suspition &amp; feare of domesticall &amp; forreigne enemies on al sides, that (notwithstāding he was of great and noble courage, and séemed to haue for∣ces sufficient for resistance also, if he might haue trusted his souldiers) yet he was in the end compelled, to set his seale to a <HI>Chartre</HI> of submissiō, wherby he acknowleged himselfe to holde the Crowne of England of the <HI>Popes Mitre,</HI> &amp; promised to pay yerely for the same and for <HI>Ire∣land, 1000.</HI> Markes, to y<SUP>e</SUP> holy father &amp; his successours for euer: this Chartre, because it was afterward with great insultation and triumph closed in Golde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gol∣den Bull.</NOTE> was then com∣monly called, <HI>Aurea Bulla,</HI> the <HI>Bull</HI> of <HI>Golde.</HI></P>

<P>And for plaine declaration, that his submission pro∣ceaded not with their consent, I read in a treatise of one <HI>Simon de Boraston</HI> (a Frier Preacher, in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third) the which he wrote concerning the Kings right to the Crowne of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that in the reigne of <HI>Henrie</HI> the third (whiche next of all succeaded King <HI>Iohn</HI>) there were sent from the King, the nobilitie and the commons of England, these Noble men: <HI>Hughe Bigod, Iohn Fitz Geffray, William Cantlowe, Phillip Basset,</HI> and a Lawier named <HI>William Powicke,</HI> to the generall Counsel, then assembled at <HI>Lions</HI> in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> of purpose, and with commission, to require that the saide <HI>Bull,</HI> sealed by King <HI>Iohn,</HI> might be cancelled, for as muche as it passed not by the assent of the Counsel of the Realme: and the same Authour writeth, that the <HI>Pope</HI> for that tyme did put them of, by colour of more waightie affaires, whiche the Counsel had then in hand. I know, that it may wel be thought néedlesse, to labour further in confuting a litle, so weightles: (for it is true, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, <HI>Stultum est, absurdas opiniones accu∣ratius refellere</HI>) It is but a follie, to labour ouer curious∣ly, in refelling of absurdities.

<PB N="145" REF="87"/> that is was called <HI>Shipwey,</HI> because it lay in the way to the Hauen, where the ships were wont to ride: And that hauen taketh he to be the same, whiche of <HI>Ptolome</HI> is caled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Nouus Portus:</HI> of <HI>Antoninus, Limanis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hauē Limene, &amp; the Towne Lymne.</NOTE> of our Chroniclers <HI>Limene Mouthe,</HI> and interpreted by <HI>Leland</HI> to betoken, the mouthe of the riuer of <HI>Ro∣ther,</HI> whiche nowe in our time openeth into the Sea at <HI>Rye,</HI> but before at <HI>Winchelsey.</HI></P>
<P>His coniecture is grounded, partly (as you sée) vpon the <HI>Etymologie</HI> of the name, partly vpon the considera∣tion of some antiquities that be neare to the place, and partly also vpon the report of the countrie people, who holde fast y<SUP>e</SUP> same opinion, which they haue by tradition receaued from their Elders.</P>
<P>In déede, the name, bothe in Greeke, and olde Eng∣lishe, whiche followethe the Gréeke, that is to say, <HI>Limen</HI> and <HI>Limene Mouthe,</HI> doth signifie a Hauen, wherof the Town of <HI>Lymne</HI> adioyning, and the whole <HI>Deanrie,</HI> or limit of the Ecclesiastical iurisdiction, in whiche it stan∣deth (for that also is called <HI>Lymne</HI>) by likelyhoode tooke the name. This Hauen (saithe he) stoode at the firste, vnder a highe Rocke in the Parishe of <HI>Lymne,</HI> vnder the whiche there was situate a strong Castle for the defence of the Porte, the ruines of whiche buyl∣ding be yet apparent to the eye. There is ex∣tant also, a faire paued cawsey, some myles of length, leading from <HI>Canterbury</HI> toward the same Porte: and they of the Towne enioye the Priuileges of the <HI>Fiue Portes,</HI> and doe reserue a brasen Horne, and a Mace, as ensignes of Castle Garde, and administration of Ius∣tice, in olde time exercised there. Finally they af∣firme, that (the water forsaking them by litle and litle) decay and solitude came at the length vpon the place.</P>
<P>For, whereas at the first, ships were accustomed to
<PB N="146" REF="88"/> discharge at <HI>Lymne,</HI> the Sea afterwarde (either hinde∣red by the sandes, or not helped by the fresh water) shor∣tned his fludde, and caused the Merchaunts to vnlade at <HI>Westhithe:</HI> Neither did it yet ascend so highe any long season, but by continuall decreasings, withdrew it self, &amp; at the length compelled them to lay their wares on land at this <HI>Hithe,</HI> whiche nowe standeth in déede, but yet without any great benefit of the Sea, for asmuche as at this day, the water floweth not to the Towne by halfe a myle and more. These coniectures, &amp; reports, be resonable, but yet, as I am sure that they be vtterly at variaunce with that opinion, whiche <HI>Leland</HI> would plante of the present course of the Riuer of <HI>Rother</HI> (as wee will shewe in <HI>Newendene,</HI> when, wee shall come to the place) so am I in doubt also, what meanes may be found, to reconcile them with the relations of <HI>Asserus Meneuensis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer Limen, now Rother.</NOTE> <HI>Henrie Huntingdon,</HI> &amp; our olde <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicles, al which séeme to affirme, that <HI>Aple∣dore</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apledore.</NOTE> stoode vpon the water <HI>Lymen,</HI> whiche if it be so, then I sée not (the places considered) howe this Towne of <HI>Lymne</HI> could euer be situated vpō the same Riuer.</P>

And for this purpose (amongst sundry fleightes, set to shewe in sundry places, about the latter end and declination of that his reigne) one was wrought by the <HI>Holy maide of Kent,</HI> in a Chappel at this towne, in deuise as malicious, in déede as mischeuous, and in discouerie as notorious, as any other whatsoeuer.</P>
<P>But bycause the midst, and end of this Pageant, is yet fresh in the knowledge of many on liuing, &amp; manifested to al men in bookes abroade: And for that the beginning thereof is knowne to verie fewe, and likely in time to be hid from all, if it be not by some way or other continued in mynde: I will laboure only to bewray the same, and in suche sorte, as the mainteiners thereof them selues
<PB N="149" REF="90"/> haue committed it to writing.</P>
<P>For not long since, it chaunced me to sée a litle Pam∣phlet, conteining foure and twentie leaues, penned I wote not by what doltishe dreamer, printed by <HI>Robert Redman,</HI> Intituled: <HI>A marueilous woorke of late done at Court of Streete in Kent, and published (as it preten∣deth) to the deuout people of that time for their spiri∣tuall consolation:</HI> in whiche I founde the very first be∣ginning, to haue beene as followeth.</P>
<P>About the time of <HI>Easter,</HI> in the seuentéenthe yeare of <MILESTONE N="1525"/> the Reigne of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight, it happened a cer∣taine maiden named <HI>Elizabethe Barton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The holy Maide of Kent.</NOTE> then seruaunt to one <HI>Thomas Kob,</HI> of the Parishe of <HI>Aldington,</HI> twelue myles distant from <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to be touched with a great infirmitie in her body, whiche did ascend at diuers times vp into her throte, and swelled greatly: during the time whereof, she séemed to be in grieuous paine, in so muche as a man would haue thought, that she had suffred the panges of deathe it selfe, vntill the disease descended, and fell downe into the bodie a∣gaine.</P>
<P>Thus she continued by fittes, the space of seuen mo∣nethes, and more, and at the laste, in the Moneth of <HI>No∣uember</HI> (at whiche time also a yong Childe of her Mais∣ters lay desperatly sicke in a cradle by her) she being vexed with the former disease, asked (with great pangs and groning) whether the Childe were yet departed this life, or noe: And when the women that attended vp∣on them bothe in their sickenesse, aunswered no, she re∣plied that it should anone: whiche woord was no sooner vttered, but the childe fetched a great sighe, and withall the soule departed out of the body.</P>
<P>This her diuination and foretelling, was the first matter, that moued her hearers to admiration: But
<PB N="150" REF="91"/> after this, in sundry of her fits following, althoughe she seemed to the beholders to lye as still as a deade body (not mouing any part at all) as well in the traunces themselues, as after the pangs passed also, she told plain∣ly of diuers things done at the Church, and other places where she was not present, whiche neuerthelesse she séemed (by signes procéeding from her) most liuely to be∣holde (as it were) with her eye: She tolde also, of hea∣uen, hell, and purgatorie, and of the ioyes, and sorrowes, that sundry departed soules had, and suffered there: She spake frankly againste the corruption of manners and euill life: She exhorted repaire to the Churche, hearing of Masse, confession to Priestes, prayer to our <HI>Lady</HI> and Sainctes, and to be short, made in all pointes, confession and confirmation of the Popish Créede and Catechisme, and that so deuoutly and discretely (in the opiniō of mine authour) that he thought it not possible for her to speake in that manner.</P>
<P>But amongst other things, this one was euer much in her mouthe, that <HI>She woulde goe home,</HI> and that she had béene at home, whereas (to the vnderstanding of the standers by) she had neuer béene from home, nor from the place where she laye: wherevpon being (in a tyme of another traunce) demaunded where <HI>That home was,</HI> she aunswered, <HI>Where she sawe</HI> and hearde the ioyes of heauen, where <HI>S. Michael</HI> wayed soules, where <HI>Sainct Peter</HI> carried the keyes, and where she her selfe had the companie of our <HI>Lady at Court of Strete,</HI> and had harte∣ly besought her to heale her disease, who also had com∣maunded her, to offer vnto her a Taper in her Chappell there, and to declare boldly to all Christian people, that our <HI>Lady of Court of Strete,</HI> had receiued her from the verie point of death: and that her pleasure was, that it shoulde be rong for a miracle.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="91"/>
<P>Whiche wordes when her Maister heard, he sayde, that there were no Belles at that Chappell, wherevnto the Mayden answered nothing, but the voice that spake in her procéeded, saying, <HI>Our blessed Lady wil shew moe miracles there shortly, for if any departe this life sou∣dainly, or by mischance, in deadly sinne, if he be vowed to our Lady heartely, he shal be restored to life againe, to receiue shrift, and housell, and after to depart this worlde with Gods blessing.</HI> Besides this, she tolde them what meate the Heremite of that Chappell of our <HI>Lady at Court of Strete</HI> had to his supper, and many o∣ther things concerning him, whereat they maruailed greatly.</P>
<P>And from that time forwarde, she resolued with her selfe, to goe to <HI>Court of Strete,</HI> and there to pray and of∣fer to our <HI>Lady,</HI> whiche also she did accordingly: And was there delayde of her cure for a certaine season, but yet (in the meane time) put in assured hope of recouerie. During whiche meane while, the fame of this maruey∣lous Mayden was so spread abroade, that it came to the eares of <HI>Warham</HI> the Archebishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who directed thither Doctour <HI>Bocking,</HI> Master <HI>Hadleighe,</HI> and <HI>Barnes,</HI> thrée Monkes of <HI>Christes</HI> Churche in <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> father <HI>Lewes,</HI> and his fellowe, two obseruants, his Officiall of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Parson of <HI>Alding∣ton,</HI> with commission to examine the matter, and to in∣fourme him of the truthe.</P>
<P>These men opposed her of the chiefe pointes of the Popishe beliefe, and finding her sounde therein, not only waded no further in the discouerie of the fraud, but gaue it great countenaunce, and ioyned with her in setting foorth of the same: So that at her nexte voyage to oure <HI>Lady of Court of Strete,</HI> she entered the Chappell with <HI>Aue Regina Caelorum,</HI> in pricksong, accōpanied with these
<PB N="152" REF="92"/> Commissioners, many Ladies, Gentlemen, and Gentle∣women of the best degrée, and thrée thousande persons besides, of the common sort of people.</P>
<P>There fell she eftsones into a marueilous passion be∣fore the Image of our <HI>Lady,</HI> muche like a body diseased of the falling Euill, in the whiche she vttered, sundrye metricall and ryming speaches, tending to the worship of our <HI>Lady of Court of Strete</HI> (whose Chappell there, she wished to be better mainteined, and to be furnished with a dayly singing Priest) tending also to her owne bestowing in some Religious house, for suche (sayde she) was our <HI>Ladies</HI> pleasure, and to the aduauncement of the credite, of suche feyned miracles, as myne authour reporteth. This done and vnderstoode to the Arche∣bishop, she was by him appointed to <HI>S. Sepulcres,</HI> a house of Nonnes in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where she laboured sundry times of her disease, and continued her wonted working of wonderous myracles, resorting oftē (by way of traūce onely) to our <HI>Lady of Court of Strete,</HI> who also ceassed not to shewe her selfe mightie in operation there, ligh∣ting candels without fire, moystning womens breastes that before were drye and wanted mylke, restoring all sortes of sicke to perfect healthe, reducing the deade to life againe, and finally doing all good, to al suche as were measured and vowed (as the manner was) vnto her at <HI>Court of Strete.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Elizabeth Barton</HI> was aduaunced from the condition of a base seruaunt, to the estate of a glorious Nonne. The Heremite of <HI>Court of Strete</HI> was enriched by dayly offring, <HI>S. Sepulchres</HI> got the possession of a <HI>Ho∣ly Mayden, God</HI> was blasphemed, the holy <HI>Virgine</HI> his mother mishonoured, the silly people were miserably mocked, The Bishops, Priestes, and Monkes, in the meane time with closed eyes wincking, and the Deuill
<PB N="153" REF="92"/> and his lymmes, with open mouthe laughing at it.</P>
<P>And thus the matter stoode sundry yeares together, vn∣till at length, the question was moued about King <HI>Hen∣ries</HI> marriage, at which time this holy Mayden (not con∣teining her selfe within her former boundes of hypocri∣sie) stepped into this matter also, and feyned that she vnderstoode by reuelation, that if the King procéeded to the diuorce, he shoulde not be King of this Realme one moneth after: Wherevpon, her doings were once againe examined (not by men giuen ouer to beléeue illu∣sions, but by suche as had the prudent power of prouing spirites) and in the ende her dissimulation was deciphe∣red, her Popishe comforters were bewrayed, the decei∣ued people were well satisfied, these daungerous decei∣uers were worthely executed, and the Deuill their Maister was quite and cleane confounded.</P>
<P>The circumstances of all whiche doing, I doe of pur∣pose omit (knowing that it is in the statute of <HI>.25.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 12.</NOTE> yeare of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight, and eche where else, in man∣ner, to be read, and thinking my selfe to haue per∣fourmed promise, in that I haue disclosed the first attemptes) and will nowe therefore make towardes <HI>Rumney.</HI></P>

<P>For, it is yet freshe in mynde to bothe sides, and shall (I doubte not) to the profite of the one, be con∣tinued in perpetuall memorie to all posteritie, by what notable imposture, fraud, Iuggling, and <HI>Legierdemain,</HI> the sillie lambes of <HI>Gods</HI> flocke were (not long since) seduced by the false <HI>Romishe</HI> Foxes at this Abbay.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The vngra∣tions Rood of Grace.</NOTE>It chaunced (as the tale is) that vpon a time, a cunning Carpenter of our cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trey, was taken pry∣soner
<PB N="183" REF="107"/> in the warres betwéene vs and Fraunce, who (wanting otherwise to satisfie for his raunsome, and hauing good leysure to deuise for his deliueraunce) thought it best to attempt some curious enterprise, within the compasse of his owne Art and skill, to make him selfe some money withall: And therefore, getting together fit matter for his purpose, he compacted of wood wyer, paste, and paper, a Roode of suche exquisite arte, and workmanship, that it not onely matched in comely∣nesse, and due proportion of the partes, the beste of the common sorte: but in straunge motion, varietie of ge∣sture, and nimblenesse of ioyntes, passed all other that before had béene séene: the same being able to bowe downe, and lift vp it selfe, to shake and stirre the handes and féete, to nod the heade, to rolle the eyes, to wagge the chappes, to bende the browes, and finally, to repre∣sent to the eye, bothe the proper motion of eche member of the bodye, and also a liuely, expresse, and significant shewe of a well contented, or displeased mynde, byting the lippe, and gathering a frowning, frowarde, and dis∣dainefull face, when it woulde pretende offence: and shewing a most mylde, amyable, and smyling cheare and countenaunce, when it woulde séeme to be well pleased.</P>
<P>So that now it néeded not <HI>Prometheus</HI> fire, to make it a liuely man, but onely the helpe of the couetous Priestes of <HI>Bell,</HI> or the ayde of some craftie College of Monkes, to deifie and make it passe for a very <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>This done, he made shifte for his libertie, came ouer into the Realme, of purpose to vtter his Merchan∣dize, and layde the Image vpon the backe of a Iade, that he draue before him. Nowe when he was come so farre as to <HI>Rochester</HI> on his waye, he waxed
<PB N="184" REF="108"/> drye by reason of trauaile, and called at an alehouse for drinke to refreshe him, suffering his horse neuerthelesse to goe forwarde alone thorowe the Citie.</P>
<P>This Iade was no sooner out of sight, but he missed the streight westerne way that his Maister intended to haue gone, and turning Southe, made a great pace to∣warde <HI>Boxley,</HI> and being driuen (as it were) by some di∣uine furie, neuer ceassed til he came at the Abbay church doore, where he so beate and bounced with his heeles, that diuers of the Monkes hearde the noyse, came to the place to know the cause, and (marueiling at the strange∣nesse of the thing) called the Abbat and his Couent to beholde it.</P>
<P>These good men seing the horse so earnest, and dis∣cerning what he had on his backe, for doubt of deadly impietie opened the doore, whiche they had no sooner done, but the horse rushed in, and ranne (in great haste) to a piller (which was the verie place where this Image was afterwarde aduaunced) and there stopped him self, and stoode still. Nowe while the Monkes were busie to take off the loade, in commeth the Carpenter (that by great inquisition had followed) and he chalengeth his owne: The Monkes, lothe to loose so beneficiall a stray, at the first make some denyal, but afterwarde, being as∣sured by all signes that he was the very Proprietarie, they graunt him to take it with him. The carpenter then taketh the horse by the heade, and first assayeth to leade him out of the Churche, but he woulde not stirre for him: Then beateth he and striketh him, but the Iade was so restie and fast nayled, that he would not once re∣moue his foote from the piller: At the laste he taketh off the Image, thinking to haue carried it out by it self, and then to haue led the horse after, but that also cleaued so fast to the place, that notwithstanding all that euer he
<PB N="185" REF="108"/> and the Monkes also, (which at the length were conten∣ted for pities sake to helpe him) coulde doe, it woulde not be moued one inche from it, So that in the ende, parte∣ly of wearinesse in wrestling with it, and partely by persuasion of the Monkes, whiche were in loue with the Picture, and made him beléeue, that it was by <HI>God</HI> him selfe destinate to their house, the Carpenter was contented for a péece of money, to go his way and leaue the Roode behinde him.

<PB N="186" REF="109"/> as wisely as this Carpenters horse did: and had other∣wise so greate conuenience and agréement with this our Image, that a man woulde easily beléeue the deuice had béene taken from thence: But I will onely note, for my purpose, and the places sake, that euen as they fansied that <HI>Troy</HI> was vpholden by that Image, and that the taking of it awaye by <HI>Diomedes</HI> and <HI>Vlysses,</HI> brought destruction (by sentence of the <HI>Oracle</HI>) vpon their Citie: So the towne of <HI>Boxley</HI> (whiche stoode chiefly by the Abbay) was through the discouerie and defacing of this Idol, and another (wrought by <HI>Cranmer</HI> and <HI>Cromwel</HI>) according to the iust iudgement of <HI>God,</HI> hastened to vt∣ter decay and beggerie.</P>

<P>If you minded to haue benefit by the Roode of <HI>Grace,</HI> you ought firste to be shryuen of one of the Monkes: Then by lifting at this other Image (whiche was vn∣truly of the common sorte called <HI>Sainct Grumbald,</HI> for <HI>Sainct Rumwald</HI>) you shoulde make proofe whether you were in cleane life (as they called it) or no: and if you so founde your selfe, then was your waye prepared, and your offering acceptable before the Roode, if not, then it behoued you to be confessed of newe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For none might en∣ter into the Temple of Ceres in E∣leusis, but such as were innocent.</NOTE> for it was to be thought, that you had concealed somewhat from your ghostly Dad, and therefore not yet worthy to be admit∣ted <HI>Ad Sacra Eleusina.</HI></P>
<P>Nowe that you may knowe, howe this examination was to be made, you must vnderstande, that this <HI>Sainct
<PB N="187" REF="109"/> Rumwald</HI> was a preatie shorte picture of a <HI>Boy Sainct,</HI> standing in the same Churche, of it selfe so small, hollow, and light, that a childe of seuen yeares of age might easi∣ly lift it, and therefore of no moment at all, in the hands of suche persons as had offered frankly: But by meane of a pyn of wood, stricken through it into a poste (whiche a false knaue standing behinde, coulde put in, and pull out, at his pleasure) it was to suche as offered faintly, so fast and vnmoueable, that no force of hande coulde once stirre it: In so muche, as many times, it moued more laughter, then deuotion, to beholde a great lubber to lift at that in vayne, whiche a young boy or wenche had easily taken vp before him.</P>
<P>I omit, that chaste Virgines, and honest marryed matrones, went oftentimes away with blushing faces, leauing (without cause) in the myndes of the lookers on, suspicion of vncleane life, and wanton behauiour: for feare of whiche note and villanie, women (of all other) stretched their purse strings, and sought by liberall of∣fering, to make <HI>Sainct Rumwalds</HI> man their good friend and Maister.</P>
<P>But marke here (I beséeche you) their prettie policie in picking playne folkes purses. It was in vaine (as they persuaded) to presume to the Roode without shrifte, yea, and money lost there also, if you offer before you were in cleane life. And therefore, the matter was so handled, that without trebble oblation, (that is to say) first to the <HI>Confessour,</HI> then to <HI>Sainct Rumwald,</HI> and lastly to the <HI>Gracious Roode,</HI> the poore Pilgrimes coulde not assure them selues, of any good gayned by all their laboure: No more then suche as goe to Pa∣risgardein, the Bell Sauage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or some other suche common place, to beholde Beare bayting, Enterludes, or Fence playe, can account of any pleasant spectacle,

Wherat the King on the one side taking offence, pressed them many times very hard, not ceasing till he had wroong somewhat from them: And on the other side, appealing to their holy fathers ayde, procured (by their great coste) many sharp prohibitions, and proud menacies against him. So that sundry times in the reigne of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the thirde, this Balle was busily tossed betwéene the King &amp; the Pope, the Clergie (in the mean while) looking vpon, but nothing laughing at the game.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes reuenue in England.</NOTE> Amongst other things done for the manife∣statiō of the Popes rauine, y<SUP>e</SUP> same King at one time cō∣maunded a generall suruiew to be made of the Popes <MILESTONE N="1246"/> yerely reuenue within this realme, &amp; foūd it to surmoūt the yearely receipt of his owne Eschequer, in very rent, besides innumerable secret gifts and rewardes, wherof no account could be made.

A∣gaine, in the yeare, nine hundreth and eightéene, <HI>Alfleda</HI> the mightie Lady of <HI>Mercia,</HI> besieging and burning the citie it self, spoyled, kylled, &amp; expulsed the <HI>Danes,</HI> that thē possessed it: In reuenge wherof, they afterward, about y<SUP>e</SUP> end of the reigne of King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> did not only besiege, take, and burne this citie, but also put to moste barba∣rous and cruell death, <HI>Alphegus</HI> the Archebishop, (for that he refused to charge his farmours and the citizens towardes his raunsome aboue their abilitie) and they siue of the Monkes, Townesmen, and other common people, the whole nynes throughout the multitude, re∣seruing on liue the tenthe man onely: So that they left of all the Monkes but foure, and of the Lay people foure thousande and eight hundreth: Where (by the waye) it is to be noted, that this citie, and the countrie therea∣bouts (the people whereof, be like, fled thether for suc∣cour) was at that time very populous, hauing to loose fortie thrée thousande and two hundreth persons: in whiche behalfe, there want not some (I wote well) whiche doe affirme, that it had then more store of buil∣dings, then <HI>London</HI> it selfe:</P>
<P>And truely it is well knowne, that they were very riche at <HI>Canterbury</HI> also, for not long before (by the ad∣uise <MILESTONE N="1009"/> of <HI>Siricius,</HI> their Archebishop) they bought their peace at the handes of the <HI>Danes,</HI> with thirtie thou∣sande poundes of ready money. But let me proceede: fourthly, in the dayes of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the seconde, euen <MILESTONE N="1161"/> streight after the election of <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> the Arche∣shop, this citie of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was wholy consumed with fire: And nowe lately and lastly, in the reigne of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight, it was in some partes blasted
<PB N="235" REF="133"/> with flame, wherein (amongst other things) diuers good bookes, whiche a Monke of S. <HI>Augustines</HI> had brought from beyonde the Seas, were brought to ashes. I had almoste forgotten a storie in <HI>Beda,</HI> where he maketh, <HI>Mellitum mendacium,</HI> (mention of <HI>Mellitus,</HI> I shuld haue sayde) and reporteth, that when as (vpon a time) a great parte of this citie was touched with fire, and that the flame hasted towarde the house of this <HI>Mellitus</HI> (then Archebishop there) he commaunded, that they shoulde beare him against it, euen into the greatest furie there∣of. And that whereas before it coulde not be quenched by any water, (though neuer so plentiously poured vpon it) foorthwith at his presence the winde turned, and at the vehemencie of his prayer, the fyre not only ceased to goe any further, but also immediatly went out, and was extinguished. I wote wel, this writer is called, <HI>Venerabi∣lis:</HI> but when I reade this, and a number of suche, which make the one halfe of his worke, I say with my selfe, as sometime did the Poet,

<P>To procéede therefore in my former course, and to tell the trueth, litle had all these casualties of fire and flame béene to the decay of this towne, had not the disso∣lution and finall ouerthrowe of the Religious houses also come vpon it. For, where wealth is at commaun∣dement, howe easily are buildings repayred? and where opinion of great holynesse is, howe soone are cities and townes aduaunced to great estimation and riches?</P>
<P>And therfore, no maruaile, if after wealth withdrawn, and opinion of holynesse remoued, the places tumbled headlong to ruine &amp; decay: In whiche part, as I can not on the one side, but in respect of y<SUP>e</SUP> places thē selues, pitie &amp; lament this general desolatiō, not only in this Shyre,
<PB N="236" REF="134"/> but in all other places of the Realme: So on the other side, considering the maine Seas of sinne and iniquitie, wherein the worlde (at those dayes) was almost whole drenched, I must néeds take cause, highly to prayse God, that hath thus mercifully in our age deliuered vs, dis∣closed Satan, vnmasked these Idoles, dissolued the Sy∣nagoges, and raced to the grounde all Monumentes of building, erected to superstition and vngodlynesse: And therefore let euery godly man ceasse with me from hencefoorth to maruail, why <HI>Canterbury, Walsingham,</HI> and sundry suche like, are nowe in these our dayes become in manner waste, since <HI>God</HI> in times paste was in them blasphemed most: And like the souldiours of Satan, and superstitious Mawmetrie, howle, and crye out with the heathen Poet.</P>

<P>For, séeing <HI>God</HI> in all ages hath not spared to extend his vengeaunce, not only vpon the persons, but vpon the places also, where his name was dishonoured, striking the same with solitude and exterminion, as we reade of <HI>Sodome, Ierusalem,</HI> and others: Howe then shoulde he forbeare these harborowes of the Deuill, and the Pope, whiche in horrible crimes contended with <HI>Sodome,</HI> in vnbelief matched <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and in folly of superstition, excéeded all <HI>Gentilitie.</HI></P>

<Q>Vnicum Arbustum, non alit duos Erythacos.</Q></P>
<P>For in déede, one whole Citie, nay rather one whole Shyre and Countrie, could hardly suffice the pride and ambitious auarice of such two Religious Synagogues, The which as in all places, they agréeed to enrich them selues by the spoyle of the Laitie: So in no place they agréed one with another: But (eche séeking euerie where, and by all wayes, to aduaunce them selues) they moued continuall, (and that moste fier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and deadly) warre, for landes, priuileges, reliques, and suche like vaine worldly préeminences: In so muche (as he that will obserue it, shall finde) that vniuersally the Chroni∣cles of their owne houses, conteine (for the moste parte) nothing else, but suing for exemptions, procuring of re∣liques, strugling for offices, wrangling for consecrations &amp; pleading for landes and possessions: For proofe wherof,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christes-Churche in Canterbury</NOTE>After that <HI>Augustine,</HI> the Monke, whiche was sent from <HI>Rome,</HI> had found suche fauour in the sight of King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> that he might fréely Preache the Gospell in his Countrie, he chose for assembly and prayer, an olde Churche in the <HI>East</HI> part of this Citie, whiche was long time before builded by the <HI>Romanes,</HI> and he made ther∣of (by licence of the King) a Churche for himselfe and his successours, dedicating the same to the name of our Sa∣uiour <HI>Christ,</HI> whereof it was called afterward, <HI>Christes</HI> Churche. After his death, <HI>Laurence</HI> his successor, brought Monkes into the house, the head whereof was called a Pryor, whiche woord (howsoeuer it soundethe) was in déede but the name of a second officer, bicause the Bishop himselfe was accompted the very Abbat.</P>
<P>For in olde time, the Bishops were for the moste part chosen out of suche Monasteries, and therefore moste commonly had their Palaces adioyning, and gouerned as Abbats there: by meanes whereof it came to passe, that suche Abbies were not only muche amplified in wealth and possessions, but also by fauour of the Bi∣shoppes, their good Abbates, ouerloked all their neere neighbours, as hereafter in further course shall better

<P>I finde not, that any great coste was done vp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this Churche, till <HI>Lanfrancs</HI> dayes, who not only bui∣ded <MILESTONE N="1099"/> it almoste wholy of newe, and placed <HI>Benedict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Monkes therein, the number of whiche hee aduaunced from thirtie, to one hundreth and fourtie, but also erec∣ted certaine Hospitals, whiche hee endowed with one hundreth and fourtie poundes by yere, and repaired the walles of the Citie it selfe: And here by the way, it is <MILESTONE N="988"/> to be noted out of <HI>Mathewe Westminster,</HI> that there were Monkes in this house, euer since the time of <HI>Lau∣rence</HI> the second Archebishop, although some reporte, that <HI>Elfricus,</HI> was the first that expulsed the <HI>Seculer</HI> Priestes, and brought the Monkes in place.</P>

For after his death, by reason that the Pope had <MILESTONE N="1413"/> canonized his soule in Heauen, and that <HI>Stephan Lang∣ton</HI> had made a Golden shrine for his body on earth, and commaunded the Annuall day of his departure to bee kept solemne, not only the Lay &amp; Common sort of peo∣ple, but Bishops, Noble men, and Princes, as well of this Realme, as of forreigne partes, resorted on Pilgri∣mage <MILESTONE N="1228"/> to his tumbe, &amp; flocked to his Iubile for remission: In so muche, that euery man offering according to his abilitie, and thronging to see, handle, and kisse, euen the vilest partes of his Reliques, the Churche became so riche in Iewels and ornaments, that it might compare with <HI>Midas,</HI> or <HI>Craesus,</HI> and so famous and renowmed (euery piller resounding Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI> his miracles, praiers and pardons) that now the name of <HI>Christ</HI> was cleane forgotten, and the place was commonly called, Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> Churche of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>I passe ouer the stately buildings, and monuments, (I meane Churches, Chapels, and Oratories) raised to his name: the lewde bookes of his lyfe, and iestes, writ∣ten by foure sundrie persons to his praise: The blasphe∣mous Hymnes, and collectes, deuised by churchemen for his seruice: and sundrie suche other thinges, whiche as they were at the first inuen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to strike into the heades of all hearers and beholders, more then wonderfull opi∣nion of deuotion and holynes: So now the trueth being

<P>For, as touching himself (to omitte that which true∣ly might be spoken in dispraise of the former part of his lyfe, and to beginne with the very matter it selfe, wher∣vpon his death ensued) it is euident, bothe by the testi∣monie of <HI>Mathewe Paris</HI> (a very good Chronicler, that liued vnder King <HI>Henrie</HI> the third) and by the foure <HI>Pseudo Euangelistes</HI> themselues that wrote his Iestes, that the chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe cause of the Kings displeasure towardes him grew vpon occasion, that he opposed himself against his Prince, <HI>Gods</HI> lawfull and Supreame minister on earth, in maintenance of a moste vile and wicked mur∣ther. The matter stoode thus. Within a fewe of the first yeares of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the seconds Reigne, the <MILESTONE N="1146"/> Clergie of the Realme had committed aboue a hundreth seuerall murthers vpon his subiectes, as it was infour∣med him: for remedie of whiche outrage, the King (by assent of his Nobilitie and Bishops, of whiche number <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> himself was one) tooke order at <HI>Clare∣downe,</HI> that if any Clerke from thencefoorth commit∣ted felonie, or treason, he should first be degraded, and afterward deliuered to the Lay power, there to receaue as to his offence belonged.</P>
<P>Not long after, it chaunced one <HI>Philip Broic</HI> (a <HI>Cha∣non</HI> of <HI>Bedford</HI>) to be apprehended for murther, and to be brought before the temporal iustice, where he not on∣ly shewed no remorse of y<SUP>e</SUP> wicked fact, but also (in hope of Ecclesiasticall exemption) gaue very euill language to the Iudge: the Iudge complained therof to the King, &amp; the <HI>Chanon</HI> belike made meanes to the Archebishop.</P>
<PB N="242" REF="137"/>
<P>For the King no sooner endeuoured to put his Lawe in execution, but the Archebishop, (bothe forgetfull of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s duetie to <HI>God,</HI> and his Prince, and vnmindefull of his owne oth) set him selfe against it, affirming plainly, that he neither could, ne would suffer it.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Prince waxed wrothe, and by litle and litle his indignation so kindeled, (by matter that the obstinacie of the Bishop daily ministred) that in the end it was to hote for <HI>Becket</HI> to abide it: Then speedeth he himself to <HI>Rome,</HI> and poureth into the Holy Fathers bosome, complaint of moste grieuous oppression, exten∣ded against the Clergie: The Popes Holynesse, sory to discourage so good a Souldiour, as the Bishop was, and withal lothe to loose so mightie a friend, as King <HI>Henrie</HI> was, by letters and Legates, praieth, commaundethe, persuadethe, and threatneth reconciliation and attone∣ment, whiche after great a doe by the meanes of the <HI>Frenche</HI> King, and other his instruments, was in a sort brought to passe.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> retourneth with the Kings fauour into the Realme, from whence he had six yeares before departed without licence, and therefore without, or rather against Lawe, and immediately séeketh to re∣uenge himself vpon suche the Bishops, as had in his ab∣sence assisted the King. Whiche when the King (being then in <HI>Normandie</HI>) vnderstoode, it chaunced him, in greate griefe of minde to caste out some woordes, that gaue occasion and hardines to <HI>Reginald Bere, Wil¦liam Tracy, Hughe Moruill,</HI> &amp; <HI>Richard Bryton</HI> (foure of his Gentlemen) to addresse themselues for his re∣uenge: These foure therefore, passed the Seas, came to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> found out the Bishop, followed him into his Church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and vpon the Staires of the same, did him very cruelty, and dispitefully to deathe.</P>
<PB N="243" REF="137"/>
<P>This shortly is the chiefe substance, and circum∣stance of all this Tragedie, drawne out of our owne Countriemen, and <HI>Thomas</HI> his fauourers, howsoeuer otherwise <HI>Erasmus</HI> (led by some sinister information) hathe reported it, as shall hereafter appeare in <HI>Ot∣ford.</HI></P>
<P>Wherein, as I can not on the one side allowe this murther, (executed, not by any publique Minister of Ius∣tice, but by a priuate and iniurious arme:) So on the o∣ther side, I report me to al indifferent &amp; Godly Readers, whether suche a lyfe deserued not suche a death, and whether these Popishe Parasites, that haue painted foorth his prayses, make not themselues, thereby parte∣ners of all his pride and wilfull rebellion.</P>
<P>I might here rest long, vpon diuerse other thinges concerning the King and this Archebishop, namely, how that he suffered the King to holde his stirup twise in one day in <HI>Normandie,</HI> but in <HI>Prato Proditorum,</HI> as <HI>Mathewe Parise</HI> very pretely writeth it: Howe the King came with bare and bléeding féete to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to purge himselfe of the murther: Howe he bared his body to the Monkes of this house, and receaued of euery Religi∣ous Person there, foure, or fiue stripes, in whiche selfe yeare (by the way) their whole churche was consumed with fire: and some other matters besides, which make manifestly for the proofe of great presumption in y<SUP>e</SUP> Cler∣gie, and of vile abiection of the Princes of those dayes: But, bicause that I am fearefull that I growe to long, I will leaue Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> him selfe, and after (a fewe woordes more of this Churche) step ouer to Saint <HI>Augustines.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Thomas,</HI> this Church found thrée especiall main¦teiners of the building, <HI>William Courtney</HI> which by his <MILESTONE N="1395"/>

<P>This Church, he purged from Prophane abuse &amp; name (as they say) and dedicated it to the seruice of <HI>God,</HI> and to the honour of Saint <HI>Pancrace:</HI> Neither ceassed he thus, but shortly after intreated the same King to build a Monasterie in the soyle adioyning, whiche he also ap∣pointed <MILESTONE N="603"/> to the honour of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> and Saint <HI>Paule</HI> and placed Monkes therein: This Monasterie, in me∣morie of his benefite, lost the first name, and was euer after called Saint <HI>Augustines.</HI></P>

Much like to this, it is written, that at the ouer∣throw of <HI>Carthage,</HI> the hande of one that woulde haue spoyled the God <HI>Apollo</HI> of his Mantel, was founde a∣mongst the fragments.

There was a Monk of <HI>Christs</HI> Church, cal∣led <HI>Roger,</HI> who had in charge to kéepe the Altar where
<PB N="248" REF="140"/> <HI>Becket</HI> was slaine.

<PB N="261" REF="146"/> Crowne, bycause she was by habitation a straunger and farre of, so that she might want bothe force and friends to atchieue her right: And for that also, <HI>Stephan</HI> (the Earle of <HI>Boloine,</HI> his sisters sonne) was then of greate estimation amongst the noble men, and abiding within the Realme, so that with great aduauntage, he might offer her wrong: he procured (in full Parleament) the assent of his Lordes and Commons, that <HI>Maude,</HI> and her heires, shoulde succéede in the kingdome after him: And to the ende, that this limitation of his, might be the more surely established, he tooke the fidelitie and pro∣mise by othe, bothe of his Clergie and Laytie, and of the Earle of <HI>Boloine</HI> him selfe.</P>
<P>Howbeit, immediatly after his decease, <HI>Stephan</HI> (be∣ing of the opinion, that <HI>Si ius violandum est, certe regnan∣di causa violandum est.</HI></P>
<Q><L>If breache of lawes, a man shall vndertake:</L>
<L>He must them boldly break, for kingdomes sake.)</L></Q>
<P>Inuaded the Crowne, and by the aduice of <HI>William</HI> the Archebishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> (who had first of al giuen his fayth to <HI>Maude</HI>) by the fauour of the common peo∣ple, whiche adheared vnto him) and by the consent of the holy father of <HI>Rome</HI> (whose will neuer wanteth to the furtheraunce of mischiefe) he obtained it, whiche neuer∣thelesse (as <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Newborowe</HI> well noteth) being gotten by patterne, he held not past two yeres in peace, but spent the residue of his whole reigne in dissention, warre, and bloudshed: to the great offence of God, the manifest iniurie of his owne cousine, and the grieuous vexation of this countrie and people.</P>
<P>For soone after the beginning of his reigne, sundry of the Noble men, partely vpon remorse of their former
<PB N="262" REF="147"/> promise made, and partly for displeasure (conceiued by∣cause he kepte not the othe taken at his Coronation) made defection to <HI>Maude,</HI> so soone as euer she made her challenge to the Crowne: So that (in the end, after ma∣ny calamities) what by her owne power, and their assi∣staunce, she compelled him to fall to composition with her, as in the storie at large it may be séene.</P>
<P>Nowe during those his troubles, amongst other things that muche annoyed him, and furthered the part of <HI>Maude</HI> his aduersarie, it was vpon a time sounded (by his euil willers) in the eares of the cōmon sort, that he was dead: And therewithall soudenly diuers great <MILESTONE N="1137"/> men of her deuotion, betooke them to their strong holdes, and some others seised some of the Kings owne Castles to the behalfe of the Empresse: Of whiche number was <HI>Robert,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and bastarde bro∣ther to <HI>Maude,</HI> who entred this Castle of <HI>Leedes,</HI> myn∣ding to haue kept it. But King <HI>Stephan</HI> vsed against <MILESTONE N="1318"/> him suche force, and celeritie, that he soone wrested it out of his fingers. King <HI>Edwarde</HI> the seconde, that for the loue of the two <HI>Spensers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barthol∣mew Ba∣delesmere.</NOTE> incurred the hatred of his wife and Nobilitie, gaue this Castle (in exchaunge for other landes) to <HI>Bartilmew Badelesmere</HI> (then Lorde Stew∣arde of his housholde) and to his heires for euer: who shortly after (entering into that troublesome action, in whiche <HI>Thomas,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> with his com∣plices, maugre the King, exiled the <HI>Spensers</HI>) bothe loste <MILESTONE N="1321"/> the Kings fauour, this Castle, and his life also: For, whilste he was abroade in ayde of the Barons, and had committed the custodie thereof to <HI>Thomas Colpeper,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomas Colpeper.</NOTE> and left not onely his chiefe treasure in money, but also his wife and children within it for their securitie: It chaunced, that <HI>Isabell</HI> the Kings wife, mynding a Pil∣grimage towards <HI>Cāterbury,</HI> and being ouertakē with
<PB N="263" REF="147"/> might, sent her Marshal to prepare for her lodging ther. But her officer was proudly denyed by the Captaine, who sticked not to tell him, that neyther the Quéene, ne any other, shoulde be lodged there, without the com∣mandement of his Lord the owner. The Queene, not thus aunswered, came to the gate in person, and requi∣red to be let in, But the Captain most malepertly repul¦sed her also, in so much that shee complained greauously to the king of the misdemenour, and he forthwith leuied a power, and personally sumoned and besieged the peice so straightly, that in the end, through want of rescue and victuall, it was deliuered him. Then tooke he Capitaine <HI>Colpeper,</HI> and houng him vp: The wife and children of the Lord <HI>Badelesmere,</HI> he sent to the Towre of <HI>London:</HI> The treasure and munition, he seised to his owne vse: and the Castle he committed to such as liked him. But, as the last acte of a Tragedie is alwayes more heauie &amp; sorowful thē the rest: so (calamitie &amp; woe increasing vpō him) <HI>Badelesmere</HI> him self was the yere folowing, in the company of the Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and others, discomfi∣ted at <HI>Borowbrig,</HI> by the Kings armie, and shortly after sent to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and beheaded. I might here iustly take occasion, to rip vp the causes of those great and tra∣gicall troubles, that grewe betwene this King &amp; his No∣bilitie, for <HI>Peter Gaueston,</HI> &amp; these two <HI>Spensers,</HI> the ra∣ther, for that the common sort of our English storiers, do lay the whole burthen of that fault vpon the King, and those fewe persons: But bycause the matter is not so plaine as they make it, &amp; withal requireth more wordes for y<SUP>e</SUP> manifestation therof, then I may now afoorde, &amp; for that also there is hope, that a special hystorie of y<SUP>e</SUP> reigne (penned by S. <HI>Thomas Delamore,</HI> which liued in y<SUP>e</SUP> very time it self) may be hereafter imprinted &amp; made cōmon,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pryo∣ry at Leeds.</NOTE>As touching the Pryorie at <HI>Leedes</HI> (whiche was a house of <HI>Regular Chanons,</HI> and valued in the Recordes of the late suppression at thrée hundreth, thrée score and two poundes of yearely reuenue) I finde, that one <HI>Ro∣bert Creuequer</HI> (the author of the Castle peraduen∣ture, for this was done in the reigne of <HI>Henrie,</HI> sonne to the Conquerour) and <HI>Adam</HI> his sonne and heire, firste founded it. Whiche thing might probably haue béene coniectured, althoughe it had neuer béene commit∣ted to Hystorie. For in auncient time, euen the grea∣test personages, helde Monkes, Friars, and Nonnes, in suche veneration and liking, that they thought no citie in case to flourish, no house likely to haue long continu∣aunce, no Castle sufficiently defended, where was not an Abbay, Pryorie, or Nonnerie, eyther placed within the walles, or situate at hande and neare adioyning.</P>
<P>And surely (omitting the residue of the Realme) hereof only it came to passe, that <HI>Douer</HI> had S. <HI>Martines, Can∣terbury Christes</HI> Churche, <HI>Rochester</HI> S. <HI>Andrewes, Tunbridge</HI> the Friars, <HI>Maydstone</HI> the Chanons, <HI>Grenewiche</HI> the obseruants, and this our <HI>Leedes</HI> her Pryorie of Chanons at hande. Howbeit, I finde in a Heralds note (who belike made his coniecture, by some coate of Armes lately apparant) that one <HI>Leybourne,</HI> an Earle of <HI>Salisburie,</HI> was the founder of it. In deede, it is to be séene in the <HI>Annales</HI> of S. <HI>Augustines</HI> of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> that a noble man (called <HI>Roger Leybourne</HI>) was sometime of great authoritie within this Shyre, notwithstanding that, in his time he had tasted of bothe fortunes: for in the dayes of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the thirde, he
<PB N="265" REF="149"/> was firste one of that coniuration, which was called the <HI>Barons warre,</HI> from whiche faction, <HI>Edwarde</HI> the Kings sonne, wonne him, by faire means to his part, and made him the bearer of his priuie purse.</P>
<P>Afterwarde they agréed not vpon the reckoning, so that the Prince (charging him with great arrearage of account) seised his liuing for satisfaction of the debt, by whiche occasion <HI>Roger</HI> once more, became of the <HI>Barons</HI> deuotions: But after the pacification made at <HI>Kenel∣worth,</HI> he was eftsones receiued to fauour, and was made Wardein of the <HI>Fiue Portes,</HI> and <HI>Lieuetenant</HI> of this whole Shyre. Nowe, thoughe it can not be true, that this man was the builder of this Pryorie (for the same <HI>Annales</HI> say, that it was erected long before) yet if he did but marrie the heyre, he might truely be termed the Patrone or founder thereof, for by that name, not only the builders themselues, but their posteritie also (to whom the glory of their déedes did descend) were wont to be called, as well as they.</P>

<P>And thus much shortly being said, touching the Sée, &amp; Bishops of <HI>Rochester</HI> in generalitie, it followeth, that I enter into the particular description of the Diocesse, wherein I meane to follow the order that I haue takē in <HI>Canterbury</HI> before: Namely to begin at the <HI>North∣east</HI> corner, and from thence (first descending along the bankes of <HI>Medwey,</HI> and then passing by the Frontiers of <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> and lastly returning by the <HI>Tha∣mise</HI> shore to the same point) to enuiron the whole Bi∣shoprick: whiche done, I will peruse what it conteineth in the inner partes also, and then betake me to rest.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Har∣borowe of the Nauie Royall.</NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Ven at our first entrie into the Dio∣cesse of <HI>Rochester,</HI> on the Northeast part thereof, the Harborowe of the Nauie Royall at <HI>Gillingham</HI> presen∣teth it selfe vnto vs, a thing of al other most worthie the first place, whether you respect the richesse, beautie, or benefite of the same. No towne, nor Citie, is there (I dare say) in this whole Shyre, comparable in value with this our Fleete: Nor shipping any where els in the whole world to be found, either more artificially moalded vnder the water, or more gorgeously decked aboue: And as for the benefite that our Realme may reape by these moste stately and valiant vessels, it is euē the same y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Apollo</HI> by y<SUP>e</SUP> mouth of <HI>Aristonice</HI> promised to <HI>Grece,</HI> when his Oracle was consulted against the inuasion of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> &amp; that his won∣derful armie (or rather world of men in armes) saying,

<P>And therefore, of these suche excellent ornaments of peace, &amp; trustie aides in warre, I might truely affirme, that they be for wealthe, almoste so many riche treasu∣ries, as they be single ships: for beautie, so many prince∣ly Palaces, as they be seuerall peices: and for strength, so many mouing Castles, as they be sundrie sayling vessels. They be not many (I must confesse, and you may sée) and therefore in that behalfe nothing aunswe∣rable, either to that Nauie whiche fought against <HI>Xer∣xes</HI> at <HI>Salamis,</HI> or to many other auncient Fleetes of Forreigne Kingdomes, or of this our owne <HI>Iland:</HI> how∣beit,
<PB N="275" REF="154"/> if their swiftnes in sayling, their furie in offending, or force in defending, be duly weighed, they shalbe foūd as farre to passe all other in power, as they be inferiour to any in number. For looke what the armed Hauke is in the aire amongst the feareful Byrdes, or what the couragious Lyon is on the land amongst the cowardly Cattell of the field, the same is one of these at the Sea in a Nauie of Common vessels, beeing able to make hauocke, to plume, and to pray vpon the best of them at her owne pleasure. Whiche speache of mine, if any man shall suspecte as <HI>Hyperbolical,</HI> let him cal to minde how often, and howe confidently (of late yeares) some fewe of these ships (incertaine of their interteine∣mēt) haue boorded mightie Princes Nauies of a great number of Sayle, and then I doubt not but he will chaunge his opinion. But what do I labour to com∣mend them, whiche not onely in shewe, and all reason, doe commend themselues, but also are lyke in déedes and effect to perfourme more, then I, in woord or wry∣ting can promise for them.

<P>Thus muche of the Nauie: As touching the harbo∣rowe it selfe, I haue heard some wishe, that for the bet∣ter expedition in time of seruice, Some part of this Na∣uie might ride in some other hauen, the rather bycause it is many times very long before a ship can be gotten out of this Riuer into the Sea: Indéede I remember, that I haue reade in <HI>Vegetius,</HI> that the <HI>Romanes</HI> diui∣ded their Nauie, and harboured the one part at <HI>Miseno</HI> (neare <HI>Naples</HI>) vpon the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> Sea, and the other part at <HI>Rauenna,</HI> vpon the Sea <HI>Adriaticque,</HI> to the end, that when occasion required, they might readily sayle to any part of the worlde without delay, or windlassing: <HI>Bycause</HI> (sayth he) <HI>in affaires of warre, celeritie dothe as good seruice, as force it selfe.</HI> But for all that, whether the same order be necessarie for vs, or no, whoe thoughe we haue the vse of sundrie Seas, yet wée enioy not so large and distant dominions as they helde, it is not our partes to dispute, but their office to determine, whoe for

<P>After the soudaine departure of king <HI>Hardicanutus</HI> <MILESTONE N="1042"/> the Dane, (whiche died of a surfeit of drinke, taken at a noble mans marriage at <HI>Lambhith</HI>) the English Nobi∣litie thought good to take hold of the oportunitie then of∣fred, to restore to the royall dignitie, the issue of King <HI>E∣thelred,</HI> which he in his life had for feare of y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Danes,</HI> con∣ueyed into <HI>Normandie.</HI> For which purpose, they addres∣sed messengers to <HI>Richard</HI> the Duke of <HI>Normandie,</HI> re∣quiring him to sende ouer <HI>Edward</HI> the onely sonne (then left) of king <HI>Ethelred,</HI> and promising to do their indeuour to set him in his fathers seate, So that he woulde agrée to come accompanied with a smal number of strangers: The which condition was deuised, bothe for their owne <MILESTONE N="1036"/> excuse and for the yong Princes safetie: For before this time, &amp; after the deth of king <HI>Canutus,</HI> they had likewise sent for the same <HI>Edwarde,</HI> &amp; <HI>Alfred</HI> (his elder brother y<SUP>t</SUP> then was on liue) putting them in like hope of restituti∣on, to which request, the duke their grandfather assēted, and for the more honourable furniture of their iourney, gaue them to company, diuers yong Gentlemen, of his own Country, whom he ment to make from thenceforth parteners of theyr prosperitye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A barba∣rous cruel∣tie execu∣ted vpon Straungers.</NOTE> as they had before tyme béen companions of their misfortune: But when they were come into the realme, the Earle <HI>Godwine</HI> (who sought more the aduauncement of his own house to ho∣nour, then the restitution of the Englishe bloude to the crowne,) perceiuing that by no meanes he could make a

Whiche suspicion, he bet so déepely into the heades of many of the Noble men, and especially of his nearest friends and allies, that foorthwith (vpon his persuasion) they fell vp∣on the straungers at <HI>Gillingham,</HI> and firste killed nyne throughout the whole number of the company, reser∣uing on liue eche tenth mā only: And afterward, (think∣ing the remainer to great) tythed the number also, slea∣ing in the whole, about sixe hundred persons: As for <HI>Al∣fred</HI> (the elder of the yong Princes) they apprehended, and conueyed him to the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> where first they put out his eyes, and afterwarde, moste cruelly did him to death.

<P>But now after the comming in of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and af∣ter such time as King <HI>Edgar,</HI> had permitted them to in∣habite here, and to haue conuersation with his own peo∣ple: Quassing and carowsing so increased, that <HI>Didoes</HI> sipping was cleane forsaken, and <HI>Bitias</HI> bowsing came in place, of whome the same Poet writeth,

<P>So that King <HI>Edgar</HI> him self, seing (in his own reigne) the great outrage wherevnto it was growne, was com∣pelled to make lawe therefore, and to ordaine drinking measures (by publique Proclamation) driuing certaine
<PB N="282" REF="158"/> nayles into the sides of their cups, as limits and bounds, which no man (vpon great payne) should be so hardie as to transgresse. But this vice in that short time had takē such fast roote, as neyther the restraint of law, nor the ex∣pulsiō of the first bringers in therof, could supplant yet.</P>
<P>For <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesburie</HI> (comparing the man∣ners of the Englishe men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great trou∣pes of ser∣uing men, came in with the Normanes.</NOTE> and <HI>Normanes</HI> together) com∣playned, that in his time, the Englishe fashion was, to sit bibbing, hole houres after dinner, as the <HI>Normane</HI> guise was, to walke and iet vp and downe the streates, with great traines of idle Seruing men folowing them. And I woulde to <HI>God,</HI> that in our time also we had not iust cause to complaine of this vicious plant of vnmea∣surable Boalling: which whether it be sprong vp out of the olde roote, or be newely transported, by some <HI>Danish</HI> enemie to all godly temperaunce and sobrietie, let them consider, that with pleasure vse it, and learne in time (by the death of <HI>Hardicanute,</HI> and the expulsiō of his people) to forsake it: which if they will not, <HI>God</HI> in time either graunt vs the lawe of the <HI>Heluetians,</HI> whiche prouided that no man shoulde prouoke other in drinking, or else if that may for courtesie be permitted, bycause (as the prouerbe is,) <HI>Sacra haec non aliter constant,</HI> yet <HI>God</HI> (I say) styrre vp some <HI>Edgar,</HI> to strike nayles in our cuppes, or else giue vs the Gréekishe <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Potandi arbitros, <HI>Cup Censors,</HI></HI> as I may call them, that at the leaste we maye be dryuen to drinke in some manner of measure: For it is not sufferable in a Christian Countrie, that men shoulde thus labour with great contention, and striue, for the maistrie (as it were) to offende <HI>God,</HI> in so wil∣full waste of his gratious benefits,</P>
<P>In this Hystorie is couched also (as I haue already tolde you) the firste cause of the displeasure receyued by the <HI>Normanes</HI> against this Realme, and consequent∣ly
<PB N="283" REF="158"/> the cause of their inuasion succéeding the same:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of the Con∣quest of En¦lande.</NOTE></P>
<P>For, whereas (after this crueltie, executed by the insti∣gation of <HI>Godwine</HI>) it happened <HI>Harolde</HI> (his sonne) to arryue at <HI>Pountion,</HI> against his will, by occasion of a soudaine perry or contrarie winde, that arose while he was on seaboorde, whether for his owne disporte onely, as some write: or for the execution of the Kings mes∣sage, as others say: or of purpose to visite <HI>Wilnote</HI> and <HI>Hacun,</HI> his brother and kinseman (as a thirde sorte affirme,) or for what so euer other cause, I will not dispute: But vpon his arriuall, taken he was, by <HI>Guy</HI> the Earle of <HI>Pountion:</HI> and sente to <HI>William</HI> the Duke of <HI>Normandie,</HI> where, being charged with his fathers faulte, and fearing that the whole re∣uenge shoulde haue lighted vpon his owne heade, he was dryuen to deuise a shifte for his deliueraunce: He put the Duke in remembraunce therefore of his neare kinred, with <HI>Edwarde</HI> the King of <HI>Englande,</HI> And fed him with greate hope and expectation, that <HI>Edwarde</HI> shoulde dye without issue of his body, by reason that he had no conuersation with his wife: So that, if the matter were well and in season séene vnto, there was no doubte (as he persuaded) but that the Duke through his owne power, and the ayde of some of the Englishe Nobilitie, might easily after the Kings deathe, obtaine the Crowne. For the atchieuing wherof, he both vowed the vttermost of his owne help, and vndertooke that his brethren, his friends, and allies also, should do the best of their indeuour: The wise Duke, knowing wel, <HI>Quam malus sit custos diuturnitatis metus, <HI>How euil a keper of cō¦tinuance feare is.</HI></HI> And therfore reposing much more sure∣tie in a frendly knot of alliance, thē in a fearful offer, pro∣céeding but onely of a countenaunce, accepted <HI>Haroldes</HI> othe for some assuraunce of his promise, but yet withall,
<PB N="284" REF="159"/> for more safetie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harold, the King.</NOTE> affied him to his daughter, to be taken in marriage: And so, after many princely gifts, and much honorable enterteinement bestowed vpon him, he gaue him licence to depart: But <HI>Harolde,</HI> being nowe retur∣ned into <HI>England,</HI> forgetteth cleane, that euer he was in <HI>Normandie,</HI> and therefore so soone as King <HI>Edward</HI> was deade, he (violating both the one promise and the other) reiecteth Duke <HI>Williams</HI> daughter, and setteth the Crowne vpon his owne heade: Hereof followed the battaile at <HI>Battel</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and consequently, the Con∣quest of this whole Realme and Countrie. In con∣templation whereof, we haue likewise to accuse the olde <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or rather <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the inueterate fierce∣nesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vncur∣tesie of the English na¦tiō, toward straungers.</NOTE> and cancred crueltie of this our English nation a∣gainst foreignes and straungers: which ioyning in this butcherly sacrifice with bloudie <HI>Busyris,</HI> deserued wor∣thely the reuenging club of heauenly <HI>Hercules:</HI> whiche fearing (without cause) great harme, that these fewe might bring vnto them, did by their barbarous immani∣tie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Busyris, was a tirant that sacrificed straungers: and was therefore slaine by Hercules.</NOTE> giue iust cause to a great armie to ouerrunne them: And whiche dreading that by the arriuall of this small troupe of <HI>Norman</HI> Nobilitie, some of them might lose their honorable roomes and offices, prouoked the wrath of God, to sende in amongst them the whole rable of the <HI>Norman</HI> slauerie, to possesse their goods &amp; inheritances.</P>
<P>It were worthy the consideration, to call to memo∣rie, what great Tragedies haue béene stirred in this Realme, by this our naturall inhospitalitie and disdaine of straungers, both in the time of King <HI>Iohn, Henrie</HI> his sonne, King <HI>Edward</HI> the seconde, <HI>Henrie</HI> the sixte, and in the dayes of later memorie: But, since that matter is <HI>parergon,</HI> and therefore the discourse woulde proue te∣dious and wearisome, and I also haue beene too long al∣ready at <HI>Gillingham:</HI> I will rather abruptly end it,

<P>The fame people, hauing miserably vexed the whole Realme in the dayes of King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> came at the laste to this Citie, where they founde the inhabitaunts ready <MILESTONE N="999"/> in armes to resiste them, but they assayled them with suche furie, that they compelled them to saue them sel∣ues by flight, and to leaue the place a pray to their ene∣mies: The whiche was somewhat the lesse worthy vnto them, bycause King <HI>Ethelred</HI> him selfe (not long before) vpon a displeasure conceiued against the Bishop, <MILESTONE N="986"/> had besieged the Citie, and woulde by no meanes depart thence, before he had an hundreth pounds in ready mo∣ney payd him.

Not long after whiche time, when as <HI>William Rufus</HI> (our Englishe <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> or <HI>Readhead</HI>) had stepped betwéene <MILESTONE N="1088"/> his elder brother <HI>Robert</HI> and the crowne of this realme,
<PB N="297" REF="165"/> and had giuen experiment of a fierce and vnbridled go∣uernment: the Nobilitie (desirous to make a chaunge) arose in armes againste him, and stirred his brother to make inuasion: And to the ende that the King shoulde haue at once many yrons (as the saying is) in the fire to attende vpon, some moued warre in one corner of the Realme, and some in another, But amongst the reste, this <HI>Odo</HI> betooke him to his castle of <HI>Rochester,</HI> accom∣panied with the best, both of the <HI>English</HI> and y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Norman</HI> nobilitie: This whē the king vnderstood, he sollicited his subiects, &amp; specially the inhabitants of this country, by al faire meanes and promises to assist him, &amp; so (gathering a great armie) besieged the Castle, and strengthened the Bishop and his complices the defendants in suche wise, that in the ende, he and his company were contented to abiure the Realme, and to leade the rest of their life in <HI>Normandie.</HI> And thus <HI>Odo,</HI> that many yeres before had béene (as it were) a <HI>Viceroy,</HI> and second person within this realme, was now depriued of al his dignitie, &amp; driuē to kéepe residence vpon his benefice, till suche time as Earle <HI>Robert</HI> (for whose cause he had incurred this daū∣ger (pitying the cause, appointed him gouernour of <HI>Nor∣mandie</HI> his owne countrie.

<P>For, what time King <HI>Iohn</HI> had warre, with his Barons, they gotte the possession of this Castle, and cōmitted the defence therof to a noble man, called <HI>Wil∣liam <MILESTONE N="1215"/> Dalbinet,</HI> whome the king immediatly besieged, &amp; (through the cowardise of <HI>Robert Fitz Walter,</HI> that was sent to rescue it) after thrée monethes labour, com∣pelled him to render the péece: The next yere after, <HI>Le∣wes</HI> (the Frenche Dolphine) by the ayde of the Englishe Nobilitie, entered the same Castle, and tooke it by force:</P>
<P>And lastly, in the reigne of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the thirde, <HI>Simon Mountford,</HI> (not long before the battaile at <HI>Le∣wes</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI>) girded the citie of <HI>Rochester</HI> about with a mightie siege, and setting on fire the wooden bridge, &amp; a Towre of timber that stoode thereon, wanne the firste gate (or warde) of the Castle by assaulte, and spoyled the Churche and Abbay: But, being manfully resisted se∣uen dayes together, by the Earle <HI>Warren</HI> that was within, and hearing soudainly of the Kings comming thitherwarde, he prepared to méete him in person, and lefte others to continue the siege, all whiche were soone after put to flight by the kings armie. This warre (as I haue partly shewed before) was specially moued against strangers, whiche during that kings reigne, bare suche a sway (as some write) that they not onely disdayned the naturall borne Nobilitie of the Realme, But did also (what in them lay) to abolishe the auncient lawes and customes of y<SUP>e</SUP> same. In déede, the fire of that displeasure was long in kindeling, &amp; therfore so much the more furi∣ous, <MILESTONE N="1251"/> when it brast foorth into flame: But amongst other things, that ministred nourishment therto, this was not

<P>The foundation of the Churche of S. <HI>Andrewes</HI> in <HI>Rochester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S.

But to return to <HI>Gundulphus,</HI> from whom I am by occasion digressed: he (as I said) réedified the great Church at <HI>Rochester,</HI> erected the Pryorie, and where as he found but halfe a dozein secular Priestes in the Churche at his comming, he neuer ceased, till he had brought together at the leaste thrée score Monkes into the place. Then remoued he the dead bodies of his pre∣decessours, and with great solemnitie, translated them into this new worke: and there also <HI>Lanfranc</HI> was pre∣sent with his purse, and of his owne charge incoffened the body of <HI>Paulinus</HI> (the thirde Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> who had left there the Palle of the Archebishopricke of <MILESTONE N="1087"/> <HI>Yorke,</HI> that was not recouered long after) in curious worke of cleane siluer, to the whiche shryne there was afterwarde (according to the superstitious manner of those times) muche concourse of people, and many obla∣tions. Besides this, they bothe ioyned in suite to the King, and not onely obtained restitution of sundry the possessions withholden from the Churche, but also pro∣cured by his liberalitie and example, newe donations of many other landes &amp; priuileges besides. To be short, <HI>Gundulphus</HI> (ouerliuing <HI>Lanfranc</HI>) neuer rested buil∣ding &amp; beging, tricking &amp; garnishing, till he had aduaūced this his creature, to the iust wealth, beautie, and estima∣tion, of a right Popish Pryorie.

<PB N="301" REF="167"/> selfe alwayes a seuere visitour of these irreligious <HI>Syna∣gogues) God</HI> (I say) set fire on this building twise with in the compasse of one hundreth yeares after the erecti∣on <MILESTONE N="1138"/> of the same: and furthermore suffered suche discorde to arise betwéene <HI>Gilbert Glanuille,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Ro∣chester,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1177"/> and the Monks of this house, that he for displea∣sure bereaued them, not onely of all their goods, orna∣ments, and writings, but also of a great part of their landes, possessions and priuileges: and they bothe tur∣moyled themselues in suite to <HI>Rome</HI> for remedie, and were driuen (for maintenance of their expences, to coine the siluer of <HI>Paulinus</HI> his Shryne into ready money <MILESTONE N="1212"/> which thing tourned bothe to the great empouerishing of their house, and to the vtter abasing of the estimation and reuerence of their Churche: for that (as in déede it commonly falleth out amongst the simple people, that are muche led by the sense) the honour and offring to this their Saint, ended and dyed together, with the gay Glorie and state of his Tumbs.</P>
<P>By this meanes therefore, <HI>Gilbert</HI> became so hated of the Monkes, that when he died, they committed him obscurely to the ground without ringing of Bell, Cele∣bration of seruice, or dooing of any other funerall Ob∣sequies. <MILESTONE N="1214"/> But to these their calamities, was also added one other great losse, susteined by the warres of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> who in his siege against the Castle of <HI>Rochester,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1215"/> so, spoiled this Church and Pryorie, that (as their owne Chronicles reporte) he left them not so muche as one poore Pixe to stand on their Altar.</P>
<P>It was nowe highe time therefore, to deuise some way, whereby the Pryorie and Churche of <HI>Rochester,</HI> might be, if not altogether restored to the auncient wealth and estimation, yet at the least somewhat relie∣ued from this penurie, nakednes, and abiection. And
<PB N="302" REF="168"/> therefore, <HI>Laurence</HI> of Saint <HI>Martines,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> perceauing the common people to be some∣what drawne (by the fraude of the Monks) to thinke re∣uerētly <MILESTONE N="1256"/> of one <HI>William,</HI> that lay buried in the Church, and knowing well that there was no one way so com∣pēdious to gain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint Wil∣liam of Ro¦chester.</NOTE> as the aduauncement of a Pilgrimage procured at the <HI>Popes</HI> Court, the canonization of that man, with indulgence to all suche as would offer at his Tumbe, vnderpropping by meane of this newe Saint, some manner of reuerent opinion of the Church, which before, through defacing the olde Bishops shryne, was declined to naught. But to the ende that it may ap∣peare, to what hard shift of Saints these good Fathers were then driuen, and how easily the people were then deluded, you shal heare out of <HI>Noua Legenda</HI> it self, what great man this Saint <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Rochester</HI> was. He was by birth, a <HI>Scot,</HI> of <HI>Perthe</HI> (nowe commonly called Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> Towne) by trade of life a Baker of bread, and therby got his liuing, in charitie so aboundant, that he gaue to the poore the tenthe loafe of his workeman∣ship, in zeale so feruent, that in vowe he promised, &amp; in déede attempted, to visite the holy land (as they called it) &amp; the places where <HI>Christ</HI> was conuersant on earth: in whiche iourney, as he passed through <HI>Kent,</HI> he made <HI>Rochester</HI> his way, where, after that he had rested two or thrée dayes, he departed toward <HI>Canterbury:</HI> But ere he had gone farre from the Citie, his seruant that waited on him, led him (of purpose) out of the high way, and spoiled him both of his money and life. This done, the seruaunt escaped, and the Maister (bicause he died in so holy a purpose of minde) was by the Monkes con∣ueyed to Saint <HI>Andrewes,</HI> laid in the quyre, and pro∣moted by the <HI>Pope,</HI> as you heard from a poore Baker, to a blessed Martyr. Here (as they say) shewed he mira∣cles plentifully, but certein it is, that madde folkes offe∣red
<PB N="303" REF="168"/> vnto him liberally, euen vntill these latter tymes, in whiche, the beames of <HI>Gods</HI> trueth, shining in the heartes of men, did quite chase away, and put to flight, this and suche other grosse cloudes, of will worship, su∣perstition, &amp; idolatrie. Besides this Pryorie (which was valued by the Commissioners of the late suppressi∣on, at <HI>.486.</HI> pounds by yeare) there was none other reli∣gious building in <HI>Rochester</HI>) onely I read, that <HI>Gun∣dulphus</HI> (the Bishop before remembred) builded there an Hospitall without the <HI>East</HI> gate, whiche he called Saint <HI>Bartilmewes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint Bar∣tholmewes Hospitall</NOTE> Now therfore am I come to the Bridge ouer <HI>Medway,</HI> not that alone which we presēt∣ly beholde, but an other also, muche more auncient in time, though lesse beautifull in woorke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rochester Bridge both the olde, &amp; the newe.</NOTE> whiche neither stoode in the selfe place where this is, neither yet verie farre off, for that crossed the water ouer against <HI>Stroud</HI> Hospitall: and this latter is pitched some distance from thence toward the South, and somewhat nearer to the Citie walle, as to a place more fitte, bothe for the fast∣nes of the soile, and for the breaking of the swiftnes of the streame, to builde a Bridge vpon. That olde worke, (being of timber Building) was fyered by <HI>Simon</HI> the Earle of <HI>Leycester,</HI> in the time of King <HI>Henrie</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> third, as hath already appeared: and not fully twentie yeares after, it was borne away with the Ise, in the reigne of King <HI>Edward</HI> his Sonne. Wherefore, least that as the Frost and flame, hath alredy consumed the thing it selfe: So the canker of time should also deuoure all me∣morie thereof, I haue thought méete to impart such an∣tiquities, as I haue found concerning that bridge, wher¦of the one was taken out of a booke (somtime) belonging to the late worthie and wise Counselour, Doctor <HI>Ni∣cholas Wotton,</HI> and whiche he had exemplified out of an auncient monument of <HI>Christes</HI> Church in <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> bearing this Title.</P>

<P>And because hee vnderstoode, that they had diuided themselues, and spoyled the Countrie in sundrie partes at once, he lykewise diuided his army, intending (the ra∣ther by that meane) to méete with them in some one place or other, which when they harde of, and perceiued that they were vnméete, to incounter him in the face, they determined to passe ouer the <HI>Thamise,</HI> and to ioyne with their countremen in <HI>Essex,</HI> of whose discomfiture they had as yet receiued no tideings.

<P>It shall suffice, for the moste parte of the matters (worthy obseruation) in this Testament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aunci∣ent estate of a Gentle¦man, and by what meanes gentle was obteyned in the olde time.</NOTE> that I haue already poynted at them with the finger (as it were) for that they appeare, and shew themselues manifestly at the firste sight: Onely therefore, touching the estate and degree of this <HI>Testator,</HI> I wyll (for the more light, and discouery thereof) borrow a few wordes of you. He himself here calleth <HI>Aelfric,</HI> his Lord, &amp; natural Lord, &amp; saieth further, that <HI>Aelfere</HI> was Father to this <HI>Ael∣fric:</HI> Now, what <HI>Aelfere</HI> &amp; <HI>Aelfric</HI> were, it is not hard to finde: for all our auncient Hystorians tell vs, that in the dayes of King <HI>Edgar,</HI> of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Martyr, &amp; of King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> these men were by birth, cousines of the bloud royall: by state <HI>(Eorles)</HI> which word we yet reteine in English, and which we commonly cal <HI>(Comi∣tes)</HI> in Latine, for that at the first they were parteners and companions (as I may say) with the <HI>King,</HI> in take∣ing the profits of the <HI>Shyre,</HI> or <HI>Countie:</HI> that they were also by dignitie <HI>(Ealdormen)</HI> that is, <HI>Senators,</HI> and Go∣uernours of all <HI>Mercia,</HI> or midle England: And finally that they were of such great power and credit, that <HI>Al∣fer</HI> the Father, immediatly after the death of King <HI>Ed∣gar,</HI> restored al such priests thorowout <HI>midle England,</HI> to their houses, as the King (by aduice of <HI>Dunstane</HI> the Monke) had in his lyfe expulsed, for the placeing of his Monks: And that <HI>Aelfric</HI> the sonne, resisted king <HI>Ethel∣red</HI> in that siege of <HI>Rochester,</HI> whereof you heard when we were there, For as much therefore, as <HI>Aelfric</HI> was <HI>Hlaford,</HI> or <HI>Lorde,</HI> to our Testator, and that <HI>Hla∣ford</HI> and <HI>Ðegn,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Lorde</HI> and <HI>Seruiteur,</HI> be woordes of relation, I gather that he was <HI>Ðegn,</HI> which signifieth properly a <HI>Minister,</HI> or frée <HI>Seruiteur,</HI> to the Kinge, or some great personage: but vsually at those times taken for the verie same, that we call now of the Latine woord <HI>(Gentilis)</HI> a Gentleman, that is (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) a man wel borne, or of a good stock and familie.</P>
<PB N="364" REF="200"/>
<P>Neither doth it detract any thing from his Gentrie at al, that I said he was a Minister, or Seruiteur: For I meane not thereby, that he was <HI>(Seruus)</HI> whiche woord (straightly construed) doth signifie a seruaunt, or slaue, whome they in those daies called <HI>ðeoƿe:</HI> but my minde is, that hee was a seruitour of frée condition, either ad∣uaunced by his owne vertue and merite, or els descen∣ded of suche Auncestours, as were neuer degraded: And that name, the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or eldest Sonne of our King of this Realme, doth not, in the life of his Father, disdaine to beare: For, out of the very same olde-woord <HI>(Ðenian)</HI> to serue, is framed his Poesie, or word vpō his armes <HI>(ic Dien)</HI> I serue. And thus I suppose that it is manifest, that <HI>Byrthryc</HI> our Testator was by con∣dition a Noble man, or (whiche in common acceptance abroade is all one with it) a Gentleman. Howbeit, to the ende, that bothe this thing may haue the more authoritie and credit, and that it may withall appeare, what degrees of Nobilitie and Gentrie there were in this Realme before the comming in of the <HI>Normanes,</HI> and by what merites men might ascend, and be promo∣ted to the same, I will reache a litle higher, and shewe you another <HI>Englishe</HI> (or <HI>Saxon</HI>) antiquitie, whiche I haue séene placed, in diuers olde copies of the <HI>Saxon</HI> lawes, after the end of all, as a note or aduertisement.</P>

<P>But the latter (being both the maker and maintener of the first) as it ought by all reason to be rewarded with due enseignes of honour, to the ende that vertue may be the more desirously embraced: So haue they heere appointed thrée seuerall pathe waies to leade men streight vnto it, that is to say, <HI>Seruice, Riches,</HI> &amp; <HI>Lear∣ning,</HI> or (to speake more shortly) <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Riches,</HI> in which two (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> confesseth) al the olde Nobilitie consisted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisdom is more profi∣table, when it is ioyned with riches.</NOTE> &amp; which two as y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Ecclesiast.</HI> or Preacher tea∣cheth) make a good accomplement, for (saith he) <HI>Vtilior est sapientia, cum diuitijs coniuncta.</HI> And in this parte, you may lastly perceiue also, that out of all those trades of life, which be (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) that is to say, conuersant in gaine, they admitted to the estate of <HI>Gentrie</HI> such only, as increased by honest <HI>Husbandrie,</HI> and plentiful <HI>Mer∣chandize:</HI> Of the first of which <HI>Cicero</HI> affirmeth, that there is nothing meeter for a <HI>Freeborne man:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchan∣dize, and Husbandrie</NOTE> And of the other, that it is praise worthy also, if at the lengthe being satisfied with gaine, as it hath often come from the Sea to the Hauen, So it chaunge from the Hauen into landes and possessions. And therefore (in my fanta∣sie) where as <HI>Geruas.

<P>Assuredly, through the fraude of this foxe, the Coun∣trie people (as wise as capons) were many yeares together robbed of their Hennes and Cockes: til at the length it chaunced King <HI>Hērie</HI> the eight (after exchange made with the Archebishop for this Manor of <HI>Otford</HI>) to haue conferrence with some of the Towne, about the enlarging of his Parke there: Amongst the whiche, one called Maister <HI>Robert Multon</HI> (a man, whome for the honest memorie of his godly zeale and vertuous life, I sticke not to name) detesting the abuse, and espying the Prince inclined to heare: vnfolded vnto him the whole packe of the idolatrie, and preuailed so farre in fauour, that shortly after, the King commaunded Saint <HI>Bartholmewe</HI> to be taken downe and deliuered him.</P>

Which sayd, he addeth in effect as followeth: They contended (saith he) not for reconciling Princes one to another, but the controuer∣sie
<PB N="378" REF="207"/> was only for a certaine withdrawing house, called <HI>Otforde,</HI> a place more méete for a religious mans me∣ditation, then for a Princes pleasure, with the whiche (sayth <HI>Erasmus</HI>) I my selfe coulde not haue bene great∣ly in loue, till such time as <HI>Willam Warham</HI> the Arch∣bishop, bestowed so great cost vpon it, that he might be thought rather to haue raised a new house in the place, then to haue repayred the olde: for he left nothing of the firste worke, but onely the walles of a hall, and a cha∣pell: Thus farre out of <HI>Erasmus.</HI> Wherein first (by the waye) you may espie the reason that moued King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight, to take that house by exchaunge from the Archebishop, namely, bicause <HI>Warham</HI> (not conten∣ted to continue it a plaine house, fit to withdrawe him selfe vnto for contemplation and prayer) had so magni∣ficently enlarged the same, that it was nowe become méete, to make a Palaice for a Kings habitation and pleasure. But let vs come to our matter. You sée here that <HI>Erasmus</HI> maketh this house, the matter, and mo∣tiue of all the contention, that was betwéene the King and the Archebishop: whiche if it be so, then haue not I faythfully dealt, in laying the cause thereof to be suche, as appeareth in <HI>Canterbury</HI> before, and consequently, I haue too too much abused the Reader. But for a short aunswere hereto, I do eftsoones auowe, that not onely <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Newburgh, Roger Houeden,</HI> and <HI>Mat. Pa∣rise,</HI> (whome chiefly I haue followed in this storie, and which al, were, eyther mē liuing when the matter was in hande, or borne immediatly after) do plainely testifie with me, that the ordinaunces made at <HI>Clarendune,</HI> were the very subiect and motiue of all that strife: but also the whole number of our hystoriens following, yea and the very authours of the <HI>Quadriloge</HI> it selfe (or song of foure parts, for they yealde a concent, though it
<PB N="379" REF="207"/> be without Harmonie) do all, with one pen and mouth, acknowledge the same. Amongst the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ste, <HI>Polydore</HI> sheweth him selfe excéeding angry, with some that had blowne abroad some such like sound, of the cause of this great hurley burley: for he sayth plainely, that they were <HI>Amentiae pleni, qui deblaterabant, Thomam conser∣uandarum possessionum causà, tantum iniuriarum accepisse.</HI> starke madde, which babbled that <HI>Thomas</HI> did receiue so many iniuries, for sauing of his possessions. But for all this, to the ende that it may fully appeare, bothe that <HI>Erasmus</HI> hath said somwhat, and also from whence (as I suppose) this thing was mistaken, I praye you heare the <HI>Quadriloge</HI> or storie of his life it self: for that onely shall suffice to close vp the matter. It appeareth by the authors of that worke, that after suche time as the King and the Bishop had long contended (and that with great heate) about the Statutes of <HI>Clarendune,</HI> &amp; that the Bishop, vpon great offence taken, had made thrée seuerall attempts to crosse the Seas towarde the Pope, and was alwayes by contrarie winde repulsed, and driuen to the lande againe: The King in his iust in∣dignation, sought by all possible meanes to bridle his immoderate peuishnesse: &amp; therefore, first resumed into his owne handes, al such honors and castles of his own as he had committed to y<SUP>e</SUP> Bishops custodie: Thē called he an assembly of al his Nobilitie &amp; bishops to <HI>Northāp¦ton</HI> castle, where before them all, he first charged <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> with <HI>.500.</HI> l. that he had long before lent him: for the repaiment wherof, he ther cōpelled him to giue fiue se∣ueral sureties: This done, he called him to an account for <HI>.30000.</HI> Markes, receiued of the reuenues of the crown, during the time that he was Chancelour. Now, whiles the Archbishop was much troubled w<SUP>t</SUP> this mat∣ter (sometime denying to yeald any account at al, som∣time
<PB N="380" REF="208"/> crauing respite to make a resolute aunswere, but alwayes delaying the time, and meditating howe to shifte the place) there commeth (on a time) into his lodging, the Bishops of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Chichester:</HI> who, finding him at supper, sayde vnto him (worde for worde of the <HI>Quadriloge</HI>) as followeth, that is, <HI>That they had founde out a way for peace: and when the Archebi∣shop had required, vnder what forme, they answered: There is a question for money betweene you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Manor of Winghā.</NOTE> <HI>and the King: If therefore you will assigne vnto the King, your two Manors, Otford and Wingham in the name of a pledge, we beleue that he being therwith pacified, will not only resigne you the Manors againe, and for∣giue you the money, but also a great deale the sooner receiue you to his fauour.</HI> To this, the Archebishop re∣plied, <HI>The manor of Heche was somtime belonging to the Church of Canterburie (as I haue hard) which the King now hath in demeane: And albeit that the only challenge of the thing is sufficient cause to haue it re∣stored to the Church of Canterbury, yet I do not loke that it will be doone in these times: Neuerthelesse, rather then I wil renounce the right, which the church of Canterbury is sayd to haue in that Manor, either for the appeasing of any trouble whatsoeuer, or for recouerie of the Kings fauour, I will offer this head of mine (and touched it) to any hazarde or daunger, what soeuer it be:</HI> The Bishops being angrie with this, wēt out from him, and tolde the King of all, and his indigna∣tion was sore kindled with it. Thus muche out of the <HI>Quadriloge</HI> faithfully translated. Nowe, vpon the whole matter it appeareth: first, that the quarell was for the lawes of <HI>Clarendùne</HI> (whiche yet depended) and then, that, euen as a fire, being once kindled, the flame séeketh all about, and imbraceth whatsoeuer it findeth
<PB N="381" REF="208"/> in the way: So the King being offended with the rebel∣lion of this Bishop, left no stone vntaken vp, that might be hurled at him, &amp; therefore brought in against him, bothe debts, accompts, and whatsoeuer other meanes of annoyaunce. Moreouer, that this matter of <HI>Otford</HI> and <HI>Wingham</HI> (for as you nowe sée it was not <HI>Otford</HI> alone) was not at all tossed betwéene the King and the Archebishop, but only moued by the pacifiers (these two Bishops) as a méete meane of reconciliation, in their owne opinion and iudgement: or, if it may be thought, that they were sent and suborned by the King himselfe with that deuise: yet is it manifest, that the right of the houses themselues were not desired, but onely that they might remaine as a paine till the account were audi∣ted: Neither if the gifte of this house would haue made an end of the strife, doth it by and by followe, that the contention was moued at the first about it. And ther∣fore as on the one side you may sée, that <HI>Erasmus</HI> his reporte is but matter of Preface and no Gospell: So yet on the other side it is euident, that of such and so lus∣tie a stomacke was this Archebishop, that if former cause had not béene, yet he could haue found in his hart to fall out with his Prince for this, or a smaller matter.</P>
<P>For, what would he not aduenture for a Manor or twaine in lawfull possession, that would not sticke to hazard his head before he would release that right, whi∣che he thought he had to a piece of land, and that but on∣ly by hearesay, or supposition? But it is more thē time to make an end, and therefore leauing <HI>Thomas,</HI> and his house in the bottome, let vs climbe the Hill toward <HI>Sen∣nocke.</HI></P>

Nowe therfore I will deliuer you, and rest me: wishing, that some other man, of greater pro∣fite in reading, deapth in iudgement, and dexteritie in penning, would take in hand to amend the description of this, and to adde the residue.</P>

<HEAD>The Customes of Kent.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lthough good order would haue borne the rehersall of the Auncient Customes of this Shyre, in that generall discourse whiche we had in the beginning as tou∣ching the estate of this whole Countie, the rather for that it was there shewed by what meanes and policie they were conserued: yet, least the recitall of the same (being of themselues large and manyfolde) might haue béene thought too great a <HI>Parenthesis,</HI> or rather an interruption of the Hystorie, wherein we were as then but newly entred, I thought it better to reserue them for this place, to the end, that bothe the one and the other, might appeare, without breache, or confusion.</P>
<P>These Customes, therefore, being (for the most part) discrepant from the common lawes of our Realme, and annexed to suche landes within this Shyre, as beare the name of <HI>Gauelkinde,</HI> are commonly called <HI>Gauel∣kinde Customes,</HI> for that they preuaile and haue place, in landes of <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> nature. In whiche respect, it shall not be amisse to shewe, for what reason those landes were at the first so termed, and why they do yet hitherto continue the name.</P>
<P>Two coniectures I haue of the reason of this name, the one grounded vpon the nature of the discent, and in∣heritance of these landes themselues: the other founded vpon the manner of the duetie and seruices, that they yeald: bothe whiche I will not sticke to recite, and yet leaue to eache man frée choice, to receaue either, or to refuse bothe, as it shall best lyke him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The name Gauel∣kind, wher∣of it arose.</NOTE>I gather by <HI>Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> and others, that the auncient <HI>Germans,</HI> (whose ofspring we be) suffred their landes to descend, not to the Eldest Sonne alone, but to the whole number of their male Children: &amp; I finde in y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>75.</HI> Chap. of <HI>Canutus</HI> law (a King of this Realme before
<PB N="389" REF="212"/> the Conquest) that after the death of the father, his heires shoulde diuide bothe his goods, and his landes a∣mongst them. Nowe, for as muche as all the nexte of the kinred did this inherite together, I coniecture, that therfore the land was called, eyther <HI>Gauelkyn,</HI> in mea∣ning, <HI>Giueall kyn,</HI> bycause it was giuen to all the nexte in one line of kinred: or <HI>Giue all kynd,</HI> that is, to all the male children: for <HI>kynd,</HI> in Dutche, signifieth yet a male childe: Besides this, the Welshmen also (who but now lately lost this custome) doe in their language call this discent, <HI>Gwele,</HI> and in their Latine Recordes, <HI>Lectus, pro∣genies, &amp; gauella,</HI> of their owne worde, <HI>Gefeilled,</HI> whiche signifieth <HI>Twyns,</HI> or suche as be borne together, bicause they doe all inherite together, and make (as it were) but one heire, and not many. And here (by the way) I cannot omit to shew, that they of this our <HI>Kentish</HI> cun∣trey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To shift lād is an olde terme.</NOTE> do yet cal their partition of land (shifting) euen by the very same worde that the lawe of <HI>Canutus</HI> many yeares since termed it, namely <HI>(Scyftan)</HI> in Latine, <HI>Herciscere,</HI> that is, to shift, depart, or diuide lande.</P>
<P>My other coniecture, is raysed vpon the consideration of the rent and seruices going out of these landes: for it is wel knowne, that as <HI>Knights seruice</HI> lande, required the presence of the tenant, in warfare and battaile a∣broad: So this lande (being of <HI>Socage</HI> tenure) cōmaun∣ded his attendance at the ploughe, and other the Lordes affaires of husbandry, at home: the one by manhoode de∣fending his Lords life and person, the other by industrie mainteining with rent, corne, and victuall, his estate and familie. This rent, and customarie payment of works, the Saxons called, <HI>gafol,</HI> and therof (as I think) they named the lande that yealded it, <HI>gafolette,</HI> or <HI>ga∣folcynd.</HI> that is to saye, lande <HI>Letten for rent,</HI> or of the kinde to yealde rent. In this sense I am sure, that the
<PB N="390" REF="213"/> rents, customes, and seruices, whiche the tenantes of London pay to their land lords, were wont (and yet are) to be recouered, by a writ, thereof called <HI>Gauellet,</HI> as by an auncient statute, made in the tenthe yeare of King <HI>Edward</HI> the second, intituled, <HI>Statutum de Gaueleto,</HI> in London, and by dayly experience there, it may well ap∣peare. Thus much then, as concerning the <HI>Etymon</HI> of this word <HI>Gauelkind,</HI> being said, let vs procéed further.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The anti∣quitie of Ga¦uelkind cu∣stome.</NOTE>It hath already appeared, how the <HI>Kentishmen,</HI> im∣mediatly after the Conquest, obteined the continuation of their customes: and it is very manyfest by auncient writers, that the same (for the more part) haue bene in vre and exercise euer since.

<P>As touching the land it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What lands be of Gauel kind nature</NOTE> in which these customes haue place, it is to be vnderstanded, that all the landes within this Shyre, which be of ancient Socage tenure, be also of the nature of <HI>Gauelkind.</HI> For, as for the lands holden by auncient tenure of <HI>Knights seruice,</HI> they be at the common lawe, &amp; are not departible after the order of this custome, except certeine, which being holden of olde time by Knightes seruice of the Archebishop of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> are neuerthelesse departible, as it may appeare by an opinion of the Iudges in the Kings benche <HI>.26.

And that may I (as me thinketh) sufficiently doe, both by the expresse wordes of a note. <HI>9. H. 3.</HI> in the title of <HI>Praescription. 63.</HI> in <HI>Fitzher∣bert:</HI> by the resolution of the same <HI>Fitzherbert,</HI> and <HI>Norwiche,</HI> Iustices, <HI>26.

<PB N="393" REF="214"/> the acte of Parleament, made. <HI>31. H. 8. Ca. 3.</HI> by whiche statute, the possessions of certeine Gentlemen (there na∣med) were deliuered from this customarie discent, and incorporated to the common lawe. For (amongst other things) in that acte it is sayde, <HI>That from thencefoorth, such their lands shal be changed from the said custome, and shall descend as lands at the common lawe, and as other lands being in the said coūtie of Kent, which ne∣uer were holden by seruice of Socage, but always haue bene holden by Knightes seruice, doe descend.</HI> By whiche wordes it is very euident, that the makers of that estatute, vnderstoode all landes holden by <HI>Knightes seruice,</HI> to be of their proper nature descendable after the common lawe, and that <HI>Socage</HI> tenure was the on∣ly subiect in whiche this our custome of <HI>Gauelkynd</HI> dis∣cent preuailed, and helde place.</P>
<P>But when I thus speake of <HI>Socage,</HI> and <HI>Knights fee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Auncient Knight fee, is not of the nature of Gauelkynd.</NOTE> I must alwayes be vnderstanded to meane of a tenure long since, and of auncient time continued, and not now newly, or lately created: for so it may fall out otherwise then is already reported. As for example. If land aunci∣ently holden by <HI>Knights seruice,</HI> come to the Princes hande, who afterwarde giueth the same out againe to a common person, to be holden of his Manor of <HI>Eastgrene∣wiche</HI> in <HI>Socage,</HI> I suppose that this land (notwithstan∣ding the alteratiō of the tenure) remaineth descendable to the eldest sonne only, as it was before: As also, in like sorte, if landes of auncient Socage seruice come to the crowne, and be deliuered out againe, to be holden eyther of the Prince in <HI>Capite,</HI> or by <HI>Knightes seruice</HI> of any Manor, I thinke it ought to descende according to the custome, notwithstanding that the tenure be altered.</P>

For, as the pleading is, <HI>Quod terrae praedictae sunt de tenura &amp; natura de Gauelkind:</HI> euen so the trueth is, that the present tenure onely guideth not the discent, but that the tenure and the nature together, do gouerne it. And therefore, as on the one side, the custome can not attache, or take holde of that which was not be∣fore in nature subiect to the custome, that is to say, accu∣stomably departed: So on the other side, the practise of y<SUP>e</SUP> custome, long time cōtinued, may not be interrupted, by a bare alteration of the tenure. And this is not my fantasie, but the resolution of all the Iustices (as Iudge <HI>Dalison</HI> him selfe hath left reported) <HI>4. &amp;. 5. Philippi &amp; Mariae:</HI> And also of the Court. <HI>26.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A contrarie vsage, chan∣geth not the nature of Gauel∣kinde.</NOTE>Moreouer, as the chaunge of the tenure can not pre∣uaile against this custome: So neither the continuance of a contrary vsage, may alter this prescription.

Againste whiche assertion, that whiche is sayde. <HI>10. H. 3.</HI> in the title of <HI>Praescription. 64.</HI> name∣ly of the issue taken thus, <HI>Si terra illa fuit partita nec ne,</HI> is not greatly forceable. For althoughe it be so, that the lande were neuer departed in déede, yet if it re∣mayne partible in nature, it may be departed when so
<PB N="395" REF="216"/> euer occasion shall be ministred. And therefore, euen in the forme of pleading vsed at this day <HI>(Quod terra illa, a toto tempore &amp;c. partibilis fuit, &amp; partita)</HI> it is plainly ta∣ken, that the worde <HI>(partibilis)</HI> onely is of substaunce, and that the worde <HI>(partita)</HI> is but a word of forme, and not materiall, or trauersable at all. Yea, so insepara∣ble is this custome from the lande in whiche it obtey∣neth, that a contrarie discent (continued in the case of the Crowne it selfe) can not hinder, but that (after such time as the lande shall resorte agayne to a common person) the former inueterate custome shall gouerne it. As for the purpose. Landes of <HI>Gauelkynde</HI> na∣ture come to the Quéenes handes, by purchase, or by eschete, as holden of her Manor of. <HI>A.</HI> Nowe after her deathe, all her sonnes shall inherite and diuide them: But if they come to her by forfayture in Treason, or by gifte in Parleament, so that her grace is seised of them in <HI>Iure Coronae:</HI> then her eldest sonne onely (whiche shall be King after her) shall inioye them. In whiche case, althoughe those landes whiche the eldest sonne (being King) did possesse, doe come to his eldest sonne after him (being King also) and so from one to another, by sundry discents: Yet the opinion of Syr <HI>Anthonie Browne</HI> was. <HI>7. Elizab.</HI> that if at any time after, the same landes be graunted to a common person, they shall reuolte to their former nature of <HI>Gauelkynde,</HI> and be partible amongst his heyres males, notwith∣standing, that they haue runne a contrarie course, in diuers the discentes of the Kings before. But muche lesse maye the vnitie of possession in the Lorde, frustrate the custome of <HI>Gauelkynde</HI> discent, as it may appeare <HI>14.

<PB N="396" REF="217"/>
<P>That is to say, first, if a tenancie in <HI>Gauelkynd</HI> eschete to the Lord, by reason of a Ceasser (as hereafter it shall appeare that it may) or if it be graunted vnto the Lord by the tenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HeaHbe∣org, in Sax¦on, is a high defence: and the customs of Normā∣die that cal fie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or fee, de Haubert whiche ow∣eth to de∣fend the lād by full ar∣mes, that is, by horse, haubert, target, sword, or helme: and it consisteth of. 300. a∣cres of land which is the same (as I suppose) that we cal∣led a whole Knights fee</NOTE> without any reseruation, which Lord hol∣deth ouer by fee of <HI>Haubert,</HI> or by <HI>Serieancie</HI> (both which I take to be <HI>Knights seruice</HI>) whether now this tenancy be partible amongst the heires males of the Lord, or no. For the auncient treatise of the <HI>Kentishe</HI> Customes so determineth, but I wote not whether experience so al∣loweth. The other dout is this, if it be so that any whole towne, or village in <HI>Kent,</HI> hath not at any time (that can be shewed) bene acquainted with the exercise of <HI>Gauel∣kynde</HI> discent, whether yet the custome of <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> shal haue place there or no.

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The custome of Gauel∣kind, is vni∣uersall in Kent.</NOTE>It is commonly taken therefore, that the cu∣stome of <HI>Gauelkind</HI> is generall, and spreadeth it selfe throughout the whole Shyre, into all landes subiect by auncient tenure vnto the same, such places only excep∣ted, where it is altered by acte of Parleament.

<PB N="379" REF="217"/> a writte of partition of Landes in <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> (saithe Maister <HI>Litleton</HI>) shalbe as generall, as if the landes were at the Common lawe, although the declaration ought specially to conteine mention of the Custome of the Countrie. This vniuersalitie therefore conside∣red, as also the straite bonde (whereby the custome is so inseperably knit to the land, as in manner nothing but an acte of Parleament can clearely disseuer them) I sée not, how any Citie, Towne, or Borowe, can be exemp∣ted, for the only default of putting the Custome in vre, more then the Eldest Sonne (in the case before) may for the like reason prescribe against his yonger Brethren.</P>
<P>But here, before I conclude this part, I thinke good first to make Maister <HI>Litletons</HI> aunswere to suche as happely wil demaund, what reason this custome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason of Gauel∣kinde Cus∣tome.</NOTE> of <HI>Ga∣uelkinde</HI> discent hathe, thus to diuide land amongst al y<SUP>e</SUP> Males, contrarie to the manner of the whole Realme besides.

Now a word or twain, touching the trial of right in this <HI>Gauelkind</HI> land, &amp; then forward to the rest of my purpose. There be at the cōmō law, two sorts of trial in a writ of Right, by Battaile, and by the Graund Assise:<NOTE PLACE="marg">No battail nor graund Assise in ga∣uelkinde</NOTE> of the which two, this Custome excludeth the one, &amp; al∣tereth the other. For, Battail it admitteth not at al, &amp; the Graund assise it receaueth, not by the election of <HI>4.</HI> Knights, but of <HI>4.</HI> Tenants in <HI>Gauelkind,</HI> as it may be read in the auncient treatise of the Customes of this Countrie. But whē I speake of the treatise of the Cus∣tomes (you must know) I mean not y<SUP>e</SUP> which was lately imprinted, but an other with much more faith &amp; diligēce long since exemplified: a Copie wherof you shal finde, at the end of this Booke.</P>
<PB N="400" REF="219"/>
<P>For, not only in this part, the wordes <HI>(Ne soient prises per battail)</HI> be cleane omitted in the imprinted Booke, but in sundrie other places also the wordes be mangled, the sentences be curtailed, and the meaning is obscured, as by conferrence of the variations, it may to any skilfull reader moste easily appeare. But all that, I will re∣ferre to the sight and iudgement of suche, as will searche and examine it, and (retourning to my purpose) shewe you, what belongeth to the Lorde of this <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> land, by reason of this Custome. And, for bicause the Prince is chiefe Lorde of all the Realme, (as of whome all landes within the same be either mediatly or imme∣diatly holden) let vs first sée what right (by reason of this custome) belongeth vnto him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfaiture in Felonie.</NOTE>If Tenant in Fée simple, of Landes in <HI>Gauelkinde,</HI> commit fellonie, and suffer the iudgement of death ther∣fore, the Prince shall haue all his Chattels for a forfai∣ture: But as touching the Land, he shall neither haue the <HI>Eschete</HI> of it, though it be immediatly holden of him self, nor the <HI>Day, Yeare,</HI> and <HI>Wast,</HI> if it be holden of any other. For in that case, the Heire, notwithstanding the offence of his auncestour, shall enter immediatly, &amp; enioye the landes, after the same Customes and serui∣ces, by whiche they were before holden: in assurance whereof, it is commonly saide,
<Q><L>The Father to the Boughe,</L>
<L>The Sonne to the Ploughe.</L></Q></P>
<P>But this rule holdeth in case of Felonie, and of mur∣der only, and in case not of treason at all: And it holdeth also in case where the offendour is iustified by order of Law, and not where he withdraweth himselfe after the faulte committed, and will not abide his lawfull triall.</P>
<PB N="401" REF="219"/>
<P>For if suche a one absent himselfe (after proclamati∣on made for him in the Countie) and be outlawed: or otherwise, if he take Sanctuarie, and doe abiure the Realme, then shall his Heire reape no benefite by this Custome, but the Prince or the Lorde, shall take their forfaiture in suche degrée, as if the Landes were at the common lawe. Whiche thing is apparant, both by the Booke. <HI>8. E. 2.</HI> abridged by Maister <HI>Fitzherbert,</HI> in his ti∣tle of prescription. <HI>50.</HI> And by <HI>22. E. 3. fol.</HI> Where it is saide, that this Custome shall not be construed by equi∣tie: but, by a straight and literal interpretation. And al∣so by the plaine rehersal of the saide treatise of the Cus∣tomes it selfe. And in this behalfe also, some haue doubted, whether the Brother or Vncle shall haue the aduantage of this Custome, bicause the wordes thereof extend to the Sonne only: but let vs procéede.</P>
<P>There belongeth moreouer, due by the Tenant, to each common person, being his Lord of Land in <HI>Gauelkind,</HI> Suite to his Court, the oathe of fidelitie, and the true doing and payment, of all accustomed Rents, Dueties, and Seruices. Also if the Tenant dye, leauing his Heire, within the age of fiftéene yeares: the Lorde hathe authoritie to committe the nouriture of the body, and the custodie of the goods, and landes of the infant, to the next of the kinred, to whome the inheritance cannot descend. But, as neither the Lorde ought to take any thing for the custody, neither to tender to the Heire any marriage at all: So must he take good héede, that he credit not the custodie to any person, that shall not be a∣ble to answere therefore. For if the Heire, at his full age of fifteene yeares, shall come to the Lordes Court, and demaunde his inheritance, although the Lord may distreine the Gardien to yeelde his accompt (as it appeareth. <HI>18. E. 2. Auowrie. 220.</HI> Yet in de∣faulte
<PB N="402" REF="220"/> of his abilitie, the Lord himselfe, and his Heires, remaine charged to the Heire for the the same.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if the Tenant shall withdrawe from the Lord his due rents, and seruices, the custome of this Countrie giueth to the Lorde, a speciall, and solemne kinde of <HI>Cessauit,</HI> and that after this manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cessauit, in Gauelkind.</NOTE>The Lord, after suche a Cessing, ought by award of his thrée wéekes Courte, to séeke (from Courte to Court, vntill the fourth Court) in the presence of good witnesse, whether any distresse may be found vpon the Tenement, or No: And if he can finde none, then at the fourth Courte it shalbe awarded, that he shall take the Tenement into his handes, as a distresse, or pledge, for the Rent and seruices, withdrawne, and that he shall deteine it one yeare and a day, without manuring it: within whiche time, if the tenant come, and make agréement with the Lord for his arrerage, he shall enter into his tenement againe: but if he come not within that space, then at the next Countie Courte the Lord ought openly to declare all that his former procéeding, to the end that it may be notorious: which being done, at his owne Courte, next following the saide Countie, it shalbe finally awarded, that he may enter into that Tenement, and manure it as his pro∣per demeane.</P>
<P>And that y<SUP>e</SUP> forfaiture, due to the Lord for this ceasser of his Tenant, was fiue pounds (at the least) besides the arrerages: it doeth well appeare by the olde <HI>Kentishe</HI> by word, recited in the often remembred treatise of these Customes.</P>
<Q><L>Neg he syth seald and Neg he syth geld.</L>
<L>And fiue pound for the were, er he become healder</L></Q>
<PB N="403" REF="220"/>
<P>That is to say, <HI>Hathe he not since any thing giuen? nor hathe he not sence any thing payd? Then let him pay fiue pound for his were, before he become tenant, or holder againe:</HI> But some copies haue the first verse thus.</P>
<P><HI>Nigond sithe seld, and nigon sithe gelde:</HI> That is, <HI>Let him nine times pay, and nine times repay.</HI> And here (by the way) it is to be noted, that this word (were) in olde time signified, the value, or price of a mans lyfe, estimation, or countenance: For, before the Conquest, each man in the Realme was valued at a certain sūme of money, hauing regarde to his degrée, condition, and woorthinesse, as is more at large shewed in the Table to the translation of the <HI>Saxon</HI> lawes, wherevnto for this purpose I will send you. This custome of <HI>Cessa∣uit,</HI> is set foorth in the treatise of Customes, and hathe béene allowed of (as Maister <HI>Frowike. 21. H. 7. 15.</HI> re¦ported) in time passed, but whether it be also at this day put in vre, I cannot certainely affirme.</P>
<P>But nowe, as these aduantages arise to the Lorde from his Tenant: So on the other side, the Lord also ought to suffer his Tenant to enioy the benefite of such customes as make for his auaile. And therefore, first he ought to let him alien his land at his owne pleasure, without suing to him for licence: He ought also to be contented with one suite to his Court for one tenement althoughe the same happen to be diuided amongst ma∣ny: of verie right also he ought to admit an <HI>Essoine,</HI> if any be cast for the Tenant, whether it be in a cause of <HI>Plainte,</HI> or for common suite to his Courte: And lastlie he may not exacte of him any manner of othe, other then that of <HI>Fidelitie,</HI> whiche groweth due by reason of his Tenure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenant by the Courte∣sie.</NOTE></P>
<P>And thus leauing the Lorde and his Tenant, let vs
<PB N="404" REF="221"/> come to the husband and the wife, and first shew what courtesie the husband shal finde by order of this custome after the death of his wife that was seised of landes of <HI>Gauelkind</HI> tenure: and then what benefite the wife may haue after the decease of her Husband dying seased of Landes of the same kinde and nature.</P>
<P>The Husband (saith our treatise of <HI>Gauelkind</HI> Cus∣tome) shall haue the one halfe of suche <HI>Gauelkind</HI> land, wherein his wife had estate of inheritance, whether he had issue by her or no: And shall holde the same during so long time, as he wil kéepe him selfe widower, and vn∣married. For if he marrie, he looseth all. Neither may he committe any waste, more then Tenant by the courtesie at the common lawe, may. So that one way (namely, in that he shall haue his wiues land for lyfe thoughe he neuer had issue by her) this our Custome is more courteous then the common lawe: but an other way, (I meane in that he shall haue but the one halfe, and that with a prohibition of second marriage) it is losse beneficiall. Howsoeuer it be, it holdeth place, and is put in practise at this day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenant in D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer, The diffe∣rence be∣tweene cō∣mon Lawe, and Cus∣tome ther∣in.</NOTE>The wyfe likewyse, after the death of her Husband, shall haue for her lyfe, the one moitie of all such landes of <HI>Gauelkind</HI> tenure, whereof her Husband was seised of any estate of inheritance during the couerture be∣twéene them. Of whiche Custome also, though it ex∣céede common measure, the common lawe of the Realm (bearing alwaies speciall fauour to <HI>Dower</HI>) hath euer∣more euen hitherto shewed good allowance: Neuerthe∣lesse, as tenant by the courtesie after this Custome, had his cōditiōs annexed: so tenant in <HI>Dower,</HI> by the same Custome, wanteth not some conditions following her estate. One, that she may not marrie at all: &amp; an other, y<SUP>t</SUP> she must take diligent héede, that she be not found with Childe, begottē in fornicatiō. For in either case she must
<PB N="405" REF="221"/> loose her <HI>Dower:</HI> But yet so, that lawful matrimonie is by a meane (contrarie to the <HI>Apostolique</HI> permission) vtterly forbidden, And the sinne of secret Lecherie (ac∣cording to the Popishe <HI>Paradoxe, <HI>Si non caste tamen cau∣te</HI></HI>) is in a sorte borne and abidden, Seing that by this custome, she forfeiteth not in this later case, vnlesse the childe be borne, and heard to crye, and that of the coun∣trey people, assembled by hue and crye: For then (sayth the custome)
<Q><L>Se that his wende,</L>
<L>Se his lende:</L></Q> But corruptly, for in true Saxon letters it stādeth thus
<Q><L>Se þat Hire ƿende.</L>
<L>Se Hire lende.</L></Q> That is to say,
<Q><L>He that dothe turne, or wende her:</L>
<L>Let him also giue vnto her, or lende her.</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus the custome, making like estimation of both the cases, depriueth her of her liuing, as well for honest marriage, as for filthy fornication. In whiche behalfe, as I must néedes confesse, that the later condition hath reason, bycause it tendeth (though not fully) to the cor∣rection of sinne and wickednesse: So yet dare I affirme, that the former is not onely not reasonable, but meerely leud and irreligious also. For, although the Ethnickes did so much magnifie wydowhood, that (as <HI>Valerius</HI> re∣citeth) <HI>Faeminas, quae vno matrimonio contentae erant, corona pudicitiae honorabant,</HI> and although that the common law also (being directed by the Popishe Clergie, whiche ther∣in followed the errour of <HI>Ierome</HI>) dothe in another case, by the name of <HI>Bigamie,</HI> dislike of a womans seconde marriage: Yet Sainct <HI>Paule</HI> sayth plainely, <HI>Mulier, si dormierit maritus eius, libera est, vt cui vult nubat, modò in Domino.</HI> But yet for all this, séeing that our treatise of vsages reciteth it, séeing also that common experience of the countrey approueth it, and that the common lawe
<PB N="406" REF="222"/> of the Realme (as it may be read, <HI>Praerogatiua Regis Cap. 16. &amp; <HI>2. H. 3. in Praescription. 59.</HI></HI>) admitteth it: let vs also for this place and purpose, be cōtented to number it amongst our customes, and so procéed with the residue. It appeareth, by that whiche is already sayde, that the common lawe, and this custome, differ in two things concerning Dower: One, in that the common lawe gi∣ueth but a thirde parte, whereas the custome vouchsa∣feth the halfe: Another, in that this custome giueth con∣ditionally, whereas the gifte of the common lawe, is frée and absolute. Nowe therefore, there remaine to be shewed, certeine other pointes, wherein they varie also. As, if the husband commit Felonie: at the common law, his wife hath lost her title of Dower, but by the custome of this countrey, she shall not loose her Dower for the faulte of her husbande, but only in suche case, where the heire shall loose his inheritance, for the offence of his fa∣ther. Which thing is manifest, both by the treatise of our <HI>Kentishe</HI> customes, and by the opinion of the <HI>Court 8. H. 3. Praescription. 60.</HI> At the common lawe also, the wife shall be endowed of a possession in lawe, but (as me thinketh) she shall haue no Dower by this custome, but onely of suche landes, whereof her husband was ac∣tually and really seised. For the wordes be <HI>(Des tene∣ments, dount son Baron morust seiset, et vestu,)</HI> which word <HI>(vestu)</HI> being cleane omitted in the imprinted booke, in∣forceth a possession in déede, and not in lawe only. And therefore, if landes in <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> descend to a married man, whiche dyeth before he make his entrie into the same, inquire whether it be the manner to endowe his wife therof, or no: for vse is the only <HI>Oracle</HI> that in this case I can sende you vnto. Againe, at the common law, a woman shal be endowed of a faire, or of any such other profit. But, (for as muche as the wordes of this
<PB N="407" REF="222"/> customarie Dower, be <HI>(terres &amp; tenements)</HI> and for that all customes shall finde a literall and streight interpre∣tatiō) the opinion of Maister <HI>Parkins</HI> is, that no Dower lyeth of a faire, by this custome. Furthermore, if the wife recouer her Dower at the common law, she ought of necessitie to be endowed by metes and boundes: But in Dower after this custome (sayth the same authour) she may very well be endowed of a moitie, to be holden in common with the heire, that inioyeth the other half. Lastly, this custome, besides Dower of the one halfe of the husbandes lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dower of chattels.</NOTE> prouideth Dower of the moitie of suche goods also, as he dyed possessed of, if he had no chil∣dren, and of the thirde part, though he leaue issue: wher∣as the common lawe (at the least in common practise at this day) hath no consideration of any suche endowmēt. These then be the differences, betwéene the common lawe of the Realme, and the particular custome of this countrey concerning Dower: the comparison whereof, and whether sort of Dower is more beneficiall, I will not now attempt, and much lesse take vpō me, to deter∣mine, least I my selfe might séeme rashly to preiudicate in another thing, wherin I most gladly desire to be iud∣ged by other men: namely, whether a woman, intituled to Dower in <HI>Gauelkind,</HI> may waine her Dower of the moitie after this custome, and bring her action to be en∣dowed of the thirde at the common lawe, and so exempt her selfe from all danger of these customarie conditions, or no? The Resolution of whiche doubte, will depend chiefly vpon comparison, whether it be more aduaun∣tage to her, to haue the thirde at the common lawe ab∣solutely, or the moitie by the custome conditionally.</P>
<P>For if the Dower at the common law be better for her, then it séemeth reasonable that she should stande to the worse, whiche is the custome: euen as tenant by the
<PB N="408" REF="223"/> curtesie, must take the moitie that the custome giueth, and not aske the whole, as Common lawe appointeth.</P>
<P>And yet thereto it may be replyed, that the cases be not like: for so muche as that of <HI>Dower</HI> is much more to be fauoured. I my selfe once heard two reuerend Iudges of opinion, that the woman was at libertie, to aske her Dower of the Thirde, or of the Moitie: But bycause it was vttered by them in a passage of soudaine speache, and not spoken vpon studied argument, I will not vse the authoritie of their names, to get the matter credite with all, but leaue it at large, to be better inquired of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Partition of chattels.</NOTE>After the husbande and the wife, there followeth next in order of our diuision, the childe and his Gardein, whom also (since they be <HI>Relatiues,</HI> as the other be, and that their interests carrie a mutuall, and <HI>Reciproquè</HI> eye, eche hauing respect to other) we will likewise cou∣ple together in one treatise. And bycause the custome was wont to commit the custodie, not of the landes on∣ly (as the common lawe doth) but of the goods and chat∣tels also, we will first shewe, what portion of goods did growe to the childe, by the death of his parent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Partition of chattels.</NOTE>The manner of this countrey somtime was (as it ap∣peareth by our olde treatise) that after the funeralles of the deade man perfourmed, and his debts discharged, the goods should be diuided into thrée equall portions, if he lefte any lawfull issue behinde him: of whiche three, one parte was alotted to the deade, for performance of his legacies: another to the children, for their educati∣on: and the thirde to the wife for her sustentation and maintenance: But if he had no children left on liue, then was the diuision into two partes onely: of whiche, the one belonged to the wife for her endowment, and the o∣ther to her departed husbande, to be bestowed by his ex∣ecutors, if he made a testament, or by the discr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of
<PB N="409" REF="223"/> the ordinarie, if he died intestate. The selfe same order is at this day obserued in the Citie of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">London.</NOTE> and the same in effect, was long since vsed throughout y<SUP>e</SUP> whole Realme. For it is euident, bothe by the lawe of King <HI>Canutus</HI> before remembred, by Maister <HI>Glanuille</HI> in his booke <HI>Ca. 18.</HI> and by the wordes of <HI>Magna Carta,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> wyfe and Children had their reasonable partes of the goods by the common lawe of the Realme, howsoeuer it came to passe at the length, that it was admitted for law but in such Countries only, where it was continued by daily vsage (as it is holden. <HI>17. E. 2.</HI> and in many other bookes) &amp; that al the writs in the Register <HI>De rationabi∣li parte bonorum,</HI> Haue mention of the speciall Custome of the Shyre, in whiche the part is demaunded. But as in déede at this day, partition of Chattels is not vsed (though in the meane time it hathe not lost the force of common lawe as many thinke) through out the whole Realme: so is it (so far as I can learne) vanished quite out of all vre within this Countrie also. And therfore, séeing the Gardein is deliuered of this charge, we also wil leaue to speake further of the goods, and come to the partition and custodie of the land of this Infant.</P>
<P>If a man die seised of landes in <HI>Gauelkinde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Partition, of Gauel∣kinde lands</NOTE> of any estate of inheritance, al his Sonnes shal haue equal por∣tiō: &amp; if he haue no Sonnes, then ought it equally to be diuided amongst his daughters: But yet so, that the el∣dest Sonne or Daughter, hath by the Custome a pree∣minence of election, and the youngest Sonne or Daugh∣ter, a preferment in the partition. For as of auncient time, there ought to be graunted to the eldest, the firste choice after the diuision: so to the parte of the youngest, there ought to be allotted in the diuision, that peice of the Mesuage, whiche our treatise calleth <HI>Astre.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">(Astr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) what it meaneth.</NOTE> By whiche
<PB N="410" REF="224"/> word is ment, (as I coniecture, for otherwise I haue not learned) either the Hall, or chiefe roome of the house, either els the well for water, or the Southe side of the building. For <HI>(Astre)</HI> being sounded without <HI>(s)</HI> may come of the Latine woord <HI>Atrium,</HI> whiche signifieth a Hall, or of <HI>Haustrum,</HI> whiche betokeneth the Bucket of a well, or of <HI>Austrum,</HI> the Southe side: euery of whiche haue their particular commodities aboue the rest of the house or tenement. Or otherwyse (if that shal like any man better) being sounded with <HI>(s)</HI> it may be deduced from the <HI>Frenche</HI> word <HI>(Asistre)</HI> by contraction <HI>(Astre)</HI> whiche is as much, as a site, or situation, and with the Article <HI>(le)</HI> before it <HI>(Lestre)</HI> a Churcheyard, or Court a∣bout a house. But whatsoeuer the woord meane, I will not longer labour in it, seing that at this day there is no suche regarde made in the partition, but only con∣sideration had that the partes them selues be equall and indifferent. Now therfore, if the Childe be vnder the age of <HI>15.</HI> yeres, the next Cousin, to whō the inheritance may not descend, shal haue the education, &amp; order of his body, &amp; landes, vntil suche time as he shall attaine to that age, euen as the Gardein in socage at the common law shall kéepe his vntill the warde aspire to fouretéene. And in all other things also, this customarie Gardein is to be charged and to haue allowance, in suche sorte, and none other, then as the Gardein in socage at the common law is: Saue only (as it is partly remembred already) that he is bothe chargeable to y<SUP>e</SUP> Heire in accompt for his re∣ceipt, &amp; subiect also to y<SUP>e</SUP> distresse of the Lord for y<SUP>e</SUP> same cause:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardein, af∣ter the cus∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome.</NOTE> Yet doe I not heare, that the Lordes take vpon them (at this day) to committe the custodie of these In∣fants, but that they leaue it altogether to the order of the next of the Kinne, the rather (belike) for that they
<PB N="411" REF="224"/> them selues (if they intermedle) stande chargeable, in default of the abilitie of suche as happely they might cre∣dit therewithall. So that vpon the whole matter, the addes consisteth only in this, that Gardein in Socage at the common Lawe shall keepe the land till the Infant be fourtéene yeares of age, and Gardein by this custome till he haue attained fully fiftéene: whiche diuersitie, a∣riseth not without great reason: For whereas the In∣fant in Socage at the common law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sale is at 15. year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> cannot make alie∣nation of his land vntill he haue reached to the full age of <HI>21.</HI> yeares (although he be long before that, frée from all wardship) The Infant in Socage by this Custome, may giue and sell his land so sone as he is crept out of this Custodie.</P>
<P>And therefore it was expedient (at the leaste) to adde one yeare to the common Lawe, before he should be of power to depart with his inheritance, whi∣che otherwise (being vnaduisedly made away) might worke his owne impouerishment and ouerthrowe.</P>
<P>And truly it séemeth to me, that the Custome it selfe hath a watchefull eye vpon the same matter, in so much as it licenceth him at fiftéene yeares, <HI>Not to giue his Land</HI> (for that he might doe for nothing) <HI>But to giue and sell his Land,</HI> whiche it meaneth he should not doe without sufficient recompence. Suche like in∣terpretation, the common Lawe also séemeth to make of this custome both by the opinion of <HI>Vauasor. 5. H. 7.</HI> who said y<SUP>e</SUP> it was adiudged that a release made by such an Infant was voide: by the sentence of the Booke. <HI>21. E. 4. 24.</HI> where it was said, that an infant cannot declare his will vpon such a Feoffment: and by the iudgement of <HI>Hank. 11. H. 4.</HI> who also helde, that a warrantie, or graunt of a reuersion made at suche age, was to no pur∣pose

And, in my simple iudgement, it is not fit that this Custome should be construed by equitie, for as muche as it standeth not with any equitie, to enable an infant, of litle discretion, and lesse experience, to sell his land, and not to prouide withal that he should haue, <HI>Quid pro quo,</HI> and some reasonable recompence for the same: for that were, not to defend the Pupill and Fa∣therles, but to lay him wyde open to euery slye deceipt, and circumuention. In whiche respect, I cannot but very well like of their opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sale good at. 15. yeares</NOTE> who holde, that if an In∣fant in <HI>Gauelkinde,</HI> at this day will sell at xv. yeares of age, these thrée things ought of necessitie to concurre, if he will haue the sale good and effectuall.

And these men for proofe of the first and second point of their assertion, doe builde vpon the wordes of our written Custome, where it is saide <HI>Del heure que ceux heirs de Gauelkinde, soient, ou ount passe lage de. 15. ans, list a eux, lour terres &amp; te∣nementes, Doner &amp; Vender</HI>) in whiche, the wordes <HI>(Ceux Heires)</HI> doe restraine the Infant that commeth in by Purchase: And <HI>(Doner &amp; Vender)</HI> in the copulatiue, (for so they lye in déede, though the imprinted booke haue thē disiunctiuely) doe of necessitie implye a recompence, for as muche as, <HI>Ʋendere,</HI> cannot be <HI>Sine precio.</HI> And for maintenance of the third matter, they haue on their part, besides the common vsage of their owne Countrie, the common lawe of the whole Realme also: which ex∣poundeth the word <HI>(Doner)</HI> to meane a Feoffment (as
<PB N="413" REF="225"/> I haue before shewed) and whiche not onely disaloweth of any gifte made by an infant, but also punisheth the taker in trespas, vnlesse he haue it by liuerie from the infantes owne handes.</P>
<P>Thus haue I runne ouer suche customes, as by meane of this <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> tenure doe apperteine, ey∣ther to the Lorde or the Tenant, the husbande or the wife, the childe or the Gardein: To these I will adde (as I promised) confusedly, a fewe other things, of the whiche, some belong generally to the <HI>Kentishe</HI> man throughout the whole Shyre: Some to the inhabitants of some particular quarter of the countrie: and some to the tenants in <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> onely, and to none other.</P>

<P>Thus muche, concerning the customes of this oure Countrie, I thought good to discourse, not so cunningly (I confesse) as the matter required, nor so amplie as the argument would beare (for so to doe, it asketh more art and iudgement, then I haue attained) But yet suf∣ficiently (I truste) for vnderstanding the olde treatise that handleth them, and summarily inough for compre∣hending (in manner) whatsoeuer the common, or Sta∣tute, lawe of the Realme hath litterally, touching them, whiche is as muche as I desired. Now therefore, to the end that neither any man be further bound to this my discourse vpon these customes, then shalbe warranted by y<SUP>e</SUP> Customes thēselues, neither yet y<SUP>e</SUP> same customes be henceforth so corruptly caried about as hitherto they haue béene, but that they may at the length be restored to their auncient light and integritie, I will set downe a true and iust transcript of the very text of them, takē out of an auncient and faire written roll, that was gi∣uen to me by Maister <HI>George Multon</HI> my Father in lawe, and whiche some time belonged to Baron Hales of this Countrie.
