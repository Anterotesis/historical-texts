<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother BENJAMIN WHETCOMBE:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y last was of the <HI>21<SUP>th</SUP>.</HI> past, of which you need no repe∣tall, having many sad passa∣ges to relate which have happened since; as the Re∣bels taking of <HI>Lismore,</HI> and all the Ca∣stles thereabouts; <HI>Lismore</HI> men made
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>very stout resistance, untill it was beaten down about their ears; they killed <HI>3.</HI> or <HI>4.</HI> hundred of them, and after came forth up∣on Quarter: They have layen down before <HI>Youghall,</HI> and have environed it round: Another Army is lately fallen on the ea∣sterside of the River, where they have planted <HI>3.</HI> peeces of Ordnance, which doth much anoy the Inhabitants: On Tuesday they made an unfortunate shot into the powder room of the <HI>Duncannon</HI> frigat, which blow her up and about <HI>18.</HI> of her men, many of the rest dangerously hurt and burnt, and another Ship (I remember not her Name) with much difficulty got forth out of the Harbour, and lieth now with the Happy entrance, and the May flower, about <HI>Cable Iland,</HI> where I fear they can do no great good, so that that Town is in great danger to be lost likewise,
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>for I know they have not provisions in it for <HI>15.</HI> daies, and they have not any thing to encourage the poor Souldiers within nor without, their Cows are starv'd, no hopes of the least benefit of harvest, and unlesse some speedy relief out of <HI>England, 2.</HI> or <HI>3.</HI> thou∣sand men and provisions, or some miracu∣lous deliverance from above betide us, their work will be soon done, I am very doubtfull before the fine of the next moneth we shall be all destroyed, and they ready to transport themselves for <HI>Wales</HI> or <HI>England.</HI> Ne∣ver were there the like barbarous acts com∣mitted by any Nation as these do daily practise; the men which they took in <HI>Ro∣stillo house,</HI> and such other prisoners as they have taken since, are carried about in the Army maked as ever they were borns, manacled with ropes and iron so that they have not the benefit of their hands to beat
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>the flies from their bodies, but are eaten and stung, and so scorched with the Sun, that it is most lamentable to behold. It is repor∣ted that within these <HI>4.</HI> or <HI>5.</HI> daies, they be∣gin to allow them (especially the women) raggs meerly to cover their nakednesse; this you may report and affirm to be truth. On Tuesday last we redeemed <HI>20.</HI> poor souls by exchange, which came to us in this con∣dition: I would have this made known to the <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI>Cornish,</HI> and to such <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> as do adhere to them against us, and be resolved whether this be as they would have it; you will finde their work being once done here, they will be posting into <HI>England,</HI> or some out of <HI>England</HI> will come unto them, and neither can be good; which might easily have been prevented, had all those that speak us fair been our friends, our bloud will be required at some of their
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>hands: Many things more of the like na∣ture I could enlarge of, but the Boat is up∣on departure that must carry this to Cap∣tain <HI>Claxtonn,</HI> who I hear is bound for <HI>England,</HI> God be his good speed. I could wish my children were with you, but I can∣not bring it to passe: J charge you in the Name of the most Highest, if J suffer, that you enquire after them, and have such care of them to be educated, as behoveth a kinsman, and to be a father to them. Now the God of all comfort and consolation, keep and preserve you from all evill; in whom J rest;</P>
