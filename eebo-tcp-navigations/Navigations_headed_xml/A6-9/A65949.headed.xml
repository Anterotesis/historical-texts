<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcidentally meeting with a certain Pamphlet concerning Courage, which was design'd (no doubt) to weaken the Hands of Gods People, or dismay their Majesties Forces in this holy War by Sea and Land; I conceived it would not be in vain for me to publish something which might tend to their Majesties Welfare, and the Encourage∣ment of the Fleet and Army in this depraved Age, wherein Fidelity is abandon'd by many as Anti∣christian. My Lords, these naked Truths in these Jejune Papers, are for the most part such as were sounded in the Ears of the Army: And therefore I have reason to hope they may be em∣brac'd by them now with the same Candidness and Singleness of Heart as they were deliver'd, in or∣der to the Advancement of Gods Glory, the good
<PB REF="3"/> of the Church Militant, against the common Ene∣my and Oppressor, and the Welfare, Peace and Hap∣piness of their Majesties and their Kingdoms. I must confess, my Lords, there is in them no Po∣liteness of Style, Floridness of Phrase, or Sweetness of Rhetorick, which may make them esteem'd by the Learned: Yet I hope a familiar Scripture-dress may not be disesteem'd by the Vulgar and more Ʋnlearn'd, for whom alone they are sent abroad in this nice Age. And since nothing is spoken here but what hath been spoken before our Days, and Treatises or Sermons are generally entertain'd ac∣cording to the Proverb, <HI>Quot Homines tot Sen∣tentiae.</HI> I must crave the Honour of your Lord∣ships as to shelter these honest, tho' unpolish'd Pa∣pers, under your Lordships Patronage, praying you to accept them, as a sincere Acknowledgment of that indispensible Duty which is owing unto your Lordships,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Numb. 14. 9.</BIBL>
<Q>Rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the People of the Land; for they are Bread for us: Their Defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: Fear them not.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEFORE we come to handle these Words in particular, it cannot be improper for to shew you the occasion of them; together with the People unto whom they are spoken; and the Person or Persons that spake 'em. We read in the Holy Bible, how God Almighty (of his free Grace and Goodness) chose the Seed of <HI>Jacob</HI> (which was afterwards call'd <HI>Israel,</HI> because as a Prince he had Power with God) unto himself, for to be a peculiar People unto him, above all other Nations: And therefore, he promised for to multiply them as the Stars of Heaven for number, and to give unto them the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> for an Heritage. And in order to the fulfilling of his gracious Covenant, the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> brought his own People out from the midst of <HI>Egypt,</HI> by Temptations, by Signs and by Wonders, and by War, and by a mighty Hand, and by a stretched Arm, and by great Terrors which he brought upon <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and his whole Host; and at length overturning them in the midst of the red Sea, as they were pursuing the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> Deut. 4. 34. More∣over, the eternal God led his own People forty Years long in the Wilderness, going before them, by Day in a Pillar of a Cloud, for to shew them by what way they should go, and by Night in a Pillar of Fire, to give Light unto 'em, and be a Wall or Defence between the Camp of <HI>Israel</HI> and the Camp of the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> So that the one came not near the other all Night. When they were come unto the Con∣fines of the Land of Promise, <HI>Moses</HI> (by the Commandment of God and Entreaty of the People) sent forth a Man out of every Tribe for to go before them and search the Land, and bring 'em Word back what it was, whether good or bad, and what People they were which dwelt therein; whether strong or weak, few or many; and whether they dwelt in Cities, Tents or strong Holds. After forty Days these Spys return'd from searching the Land, and brought with them from
<PB N="2" REF="4"/> thence some Grapes, Pomegranates and Figs, and came and told their Brethren, That it was a Land which flowed with Milk and Hony; but the People thereof were Strong and of a great Stature, and their Cities were wall'd and very great. Yea they said, That they saw there Giants, the Sons of <HI>Anak,</HI> and they were in their own Sight, but as Grashoppers unto them; and therefore there was no going up against them, they were so strong. Thus these Spys which were sent, brought up an evil Report upon the Land, insomuch that all the Congregation of <HI>Israel</HI> lifted up their Voice and cryed; and the People wept all Night, and murmured against <HI>Moses</HI> and against <HI>Aaron,</HI> saying, Would God that we had died in the Land of <HI>Egypt:</HI> Or would God that we had died in this Wilderness. Wherefore hath the Lord brought us up to fall by the Sword, and our Wives and our little ones to become a Prey? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were it not better for us to return into <HI>Egypt?</HI> And they said one to another, Let us make us a Captain, and let us return thither. Upon this <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> fell on their Faces before all <HI>Israel:</HI> And those two mighty Men of Valour, which were of them that had search'd the Land, and had another Spirit in them, following God fully; Namely, <HI>Joshua</HI> the Son of <HI>Nun,</HI> and <HI>Ca∣leb</HI> the Son of <HI>Jephunneth,</HI> used their best endeavours for to still and sa∣tisfie the People, and to cause them to be better opinionated towards the Country; and to remember how the most high God was their De∣fence, and had fought their Battels for them, against their Enemies; and how he had led them safely thither, saying, The Land which we passed through for to search it, is an exceeding good Land: If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this good Land, and give it to us. <HI>Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the People of,</HI> &amp;c. As if they had said, You whose Eyes have seen, what great things the Lord your God did for you, ever since he brought you out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or out of the Furnace, by the Hands of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron:</HI> You who are his own peculiar People, for you now to fear, when ye are at the very Borders of the Land, is very evil. There∣fore do not rebel against the Lord, in murmuring against his Ministers, <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> whom he hath set over you: But remember the mighty Hand of God, which bare you in all this Wilderness, as a Man doth his Son; and be not discouraged at the Strength of the Peo∣ple, the number of their Cities, and the height of their Walls, for the Lord your God which goeth before you, he it is that fighteth for you, <HI>Rebel not ye against,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Words do naturally teach us these three Lessons.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="4"/>1. That when once the Lord is departed from a Nation or People, Fleet or Army, it cannot prosper or stand. <HI>Their Defence is departed from them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That God only is the best and safest Defence of his Church, a∣gainst her Adversaries. <HI>And the Lord is with us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That to fear the Lord of Hosts himself, and not the Arm of Flesh, or to be very Couragious in Fighting God's Battel, is a Duty required of all his People (but especially of those which are called thereunto by lawful Authority) and a principal means for to keep the Lord with or among such a People or Army. For, says the Text, <HI>Fear them not.</HI> Of these in their order, by the assistance of the Holy Ghost, which openeth and no Man shuts, and shuts and no Man open∣eth; who can shew forth the Praises of the Most-high, out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, and whose Grace is sufficient to ena∣ble the weakest Instrument.</P>
<P>First, That when once the Lord is departed from a Nation or Peo∣ple, Fleet or Army, it cannot prosper or stand. The truth of this I shall endeavour (God willing) to make out, two manner of ways, 1. From the Nature of God. And 2. From the Testimony of his Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>First, From the Nature of God, who is the Fountain and Original from whence springs all our Happiness and Comfort; and from whom alone every good Gift and every perfect Gift comes: As Health, Strength, Grace, Meekness, Goodness, Faith, Prosperity and Plenty. It is he that gives us such fruitful Seasons, and fills our Hearts with Joy and Gladness: It is the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> alone that giveth Salvation unto Kings, and delivers his Servants from the hurtful Sword: It is that Almighty and Eternal Essence (who is the great and glorious Creator of all things, and Judg of all Men, and Searcher of all Hearts, and Rewarder of such as diligently seek him) who preserves, main∣tains and upholds, all other Beings whatsoever, both in Heaven above, in the Earth beneath, and in the Water under the Earth, by his most infinite and unlimited Power and Omnipotency. And therefore he will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy; he hath the same So∣veraignity and Power of us, and over all Kingdoms and Nations, as the Potter hath over the Clay, of the same Lump to make one Vessel unto Honour, and another unto Dishonour. He removes and sets up Kings, and disposes of Kingdoms, and changes Times and Seasons according to his Pleasure: For the Earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof, the World and they that dwell therein: So that he can do
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> whatsoever he will with the World. He hath founded the Earth upon the Seas, so that 'tis easily sunk, being a bad Foundation; and esta∣blishes it upon the Flouds, and that's as dangerous a Situation, ac∣cording to human Sense and external Appearance. But yet by the in∣finite Power of that Almighty God, who laid the corner Stone of the World, and hath set due Bounds, Bars and Doors, unto the proud swelling Sea [whose Waves roar and toss themselves, yet can they not prevail, but dash themselves into pieces] it is that this mighty Mass is supported. It is he alone that makes the Earth bring forth, that our Garners may be full, affording all manner of Store, and our Sheep may bring forth thousands, and our Oxen strong to labour, and gives us all things liberally and upbraids not. Oh there's nothing can prosper without his Blessing, who is the Foundation of all Blessings, neither can any thing be done without his Providence over us, his Spi∣rit to guide us, and Grace and Strength to enable us; who measureth the Waters in the hollow of his Hand, and meeteth out Heaven with a Span, and comprehendeth the Dust of the Earth in a Measure, and weighs the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance, <HI>Isa.</HI> 40. 12. Therefore if this most blessed and omnipotent God once but gather unto himself his Holy Spirit, his Breath, Protection and Preservati∣on, from a Nation; If he once depart from a Fleet or Army, then that Nation, Fleet or Army, which is without God, with or among them, cannot but sink and perish; because the very Elements in their kind, will then Fight against them, as the Stars in their Courses fought against <HI>Sisera.</HI> When the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> is departed from a People, then its Courage and Strength, its Rock of Salvation and Defence, its Refuge, Sanctuary and Fountain of Blessing, its Giver of Grace and Safety, yea, its only Friend and Giver of Victory in Battel, is gone away; and there can be no prospect to such a People, but Ruin and Destruction. This we find in the Case of all the Kings of <HI>Canaan,</HI> tho' they were mighty and had vast Armies: Yet notwithstanding when they once perceived, that the great God, the supream Majesty of Heaven and Earth was departed from them, and with the <HI>Israel∣ites,</HI> and assisting them wonderfully in all their Undertakings, and in drying up the Waters of <HI>Jordan</HI> for them, to enter the Land of <HI>Ca∣naan:</HI> Then presently all their Hearts melted within them for Fear, and there was no more Spirit in them, because of the Children of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> Josh. 5. 1. And therefore our Church prays, Wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our Hosts? Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of Man without thee: Through God our Forces, both by
<PB N="5" REF="5"/> Sea and Land, shall do valiantly, and 'tis he alone that shall tread down our Enemies. 'Tis said of <HI>Sampson,</HI> that after his Head was shaven, he became weak and like another Man; and he said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake my self. (Observe) For he wist not that the Lord his Strength was departed from him, <HI>Judg.</HI> 16. 20. In like manner the Adversaries of God, and his true reform'd Church, may (yea and do) take Counsel together, against our Sovereign Lord and Lady King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> as they have done at other times against Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (of blessed Memory) but it shall come to nought, and their Strength, like <HI>Sampsons,</HI> shall deceive 'em; be∣cause the Lord is departed from them. The common Enemy of Truth and Oppressor of Righteousness and Peace in <HI>Europe,</HI> may vaunt himself as at other times, and say, Is not this great <HI>Babylon,</HI> that I have built? Have not I overthrown Towns, and laid waste fenced Cities? Have not I expell'd from my Kingdom all those that would not obey me rather than God? By the might of my Power, and for the Honour of my Majesty, because I must and will be obey'd; else I will set my Blood-thirsty Dragoons upon them. But he considers not that the Lord is departed from him, and that his vast Army shall be smitten with Terror. Look well then, O thou Enemy of Truth and Peace, upon the Hand-writing on the Wall; for it may well make thy Countenance change, and thy Thoughts to trouble thee; and the Joynts of thy Loyns to be loosed, and thy Knees to smite one against another; to consider, How many thousands of Souls are now crying under the Altar against thee, saying, How long, O Lord, Holy and True, dost thou not judg and avenge our Blood on that cruel Tyrant that dwells on the Earth, who hath spilt it like Water on every side! Oh will it not once be! <HI>Rev.</HI> 6. 10.</P>
<P>Secondly, from the Testimony of his Holy Spirit, which declares plainly, That in vain is Salvation hoped for, from the Multitude of Men or Ships, from the Hills, or from the Mountains, or from any human Force or Power; for truly in the Lord our God is the Sal∣vation of his People: And says the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> The Lord is my Light and my Salvation, whom then shall I fear? The Lord is the Strength of my Life, of whom shall I be affraid? When the Wicked, even my Foes came upon me, to eat up my Flesh, they stumbled and fell, <HI>Psal.</HI> 26. 1, 2. &amp;c. Now to shew this great Truth, That when once the Lord is departed from any Nation or People, Fleet or Army, it cannot prosper or stand; We may take notice of God's own Peo∣ple themselves, the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> who when they tempted and
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> provoked the most-high God to Anger, and so caused him to depart from them, and forsake his Dwelling▪ place; how unsuccessful they were then in all their Wars, being commonly discomfited of their Enemies. As by <HI>Chushan-rishathaim</HI> King of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> whom they served eight Years: And by <HI>Eglon</HI> King of <HI>Moab,</HI> whom they were subject to eighteen Years; and the cause you read was by reason the Lord was departed from them, <HI>Judg.</HI> 3. 8, 12. Moreover we find such another Passage between <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Amalek,</HI> as long as <HI>Moses</HI> (that familiar Friend of God) held up his Hand, and thereby caused the Lord to be with his People; Then they prevailed over their Enemies. But as soon as <HI>Moses</HI>'s Hands were let down, and the Lord was de∣parted from the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> then <HI>Amalek</HI> prevailed over them. Oh where the infinite Majesty of the living and true God is present; there it cannot go any otherwise but well, whether it be Fleet or Ar∣my, for every thing that's done there shall prosper: But where the most-high is not present, or among them; there be sure it cannot be well or prosper, be their Power outwardly never so great, and their Forces never so strong. An Example of this we may see in <HI>Zerah</HI> the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> who came against <HI>Asa</HI> with the greatest Army that ever we read of in sacred or prophane History: Even an Host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred Chariots. And <HI>Asa</HI> cryed unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many or with them that have no Power: Help us, O Lord our God, for we rest on thee, and in thy Name we go against this Multitude: O Lord thou art our God, let not Man prevail against thee. So the Lord smote the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> before <HI>Asa,</HI> and before <HI>Judas,</HI> and the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> fled, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 14. 11, 12. Alas! It is not a vast and well disciplin'd Army (altho' God knows most Men now have an Eye to that chiefly) nor the Strength of Ships, nor the Skill of Seamen, nor the Courage and Conduct of Officers, no nor yet the greatness and goodness of Artillery that gains the Victory; but its the Lord of Hosts himself that fights the Battel, and gives the Victory to whom he will (altho' it cannot be denied but that all these fore-mentioned Things are absolutely needful, and as the secondary Causes of Victory.) <HI>David</HI> tells <HI>Goliath</HI> thus, saying, Thou comest to me depending altogether on thy own Strength, and well furnish'd and prepared for Battel, as with a Sword, with a Spear, and with a Shield: But now I come to thee otherwise, not so much confiding in my own Strength, as on Gods: And indeed I am sure my Strength will not fail me, and therefore I will smite thee, and give thy Carcass unto the Fowls of the Air; That
<PB N="7" REF="6"/> all the World may see and know, that thou, O Lord, whose Name is <HI>Jehovah,</HI> art the strongest and highest over all the Earth. And where God taketh the part, and is present among an Army, then there all the Enchantments, Plots, diabolical Arts or Conspiracies, are altogether invalid and ineffectual. And he, who is the Eye of his own People, will soon discover them, and bring the Plotters to shame and confusion; as <HI>Balak</HI> told <HI>Balaam</HI> concerning <HI>Israel,</HI> saying, Surely there is no En∣chantment against <HI>Jacob,</HI> neither is there any Divination against <HI>Israel,</HI> for the Lord his God is with him: And it shall be said, in the Lord's due time of our Fleet and Army, What hath God wrought! Oh what a Victory was this! When the strong holds are surpriz'd, and the mighty Mens Hearts in <HI>Moab</HI> (who have magnified themselves against the Lord and his Truth, and have worship'd other Gods, Wood and Stone) shall tremble, and be as the Heart of a Woman in Pangs. Be still then, ye Adversaries of God and Traytors to the best of Princes, speak no more so proudly against the Heritage of the Almighty: For know you assuredly that God, even our own God, will find an occa∣sion to bring down the Arrogancy of the Proud, and will lay low the Haughtiness of the Terrible. So much then for Confirmation of our first Lesson. Let us in the next place, sincerely endeavour to improve this to our selves, that so the Lord our God may be glorified, in our Body and Spirits which are his; that we being deliver'd out of the Hands of her Enemies, may serve him without fear.</P>
<P>Here is then, first, an Inference of no small Comfort, unto the Church of God militant here on Earth, in this crooked and perverse Generation; wherein all manner of Vice and Wickedness abounds daily, and Piety and Righteousness are such Strangers. To consider, That altho' War be risen against the People of God, yet, he is in the midst of his Church, to defend and keep her, that she shall not be mo∣ved by all the Storms of Trouble and fierce Darts of the Devil; which are bent wholly against her: Nor by all the Plots and Conspiracies of the Children of Darkness; because the eternal God will keep her safe from the Snare of the Fowler, and Malice of evil Spirits. Oh what a Comfort is this unto every true Believer and Child of the most-high, to ponder with it self! That tho' the Adversaries of the Lord and his Church may be far more in number, and much stronger in outward appearance; yet when the Captain of the Host of the Lord, stands ready with his Sword drawn in his Hand, to fight for his People, then they signifie nothing at all, and he can smite 'em down, even at one Blow, as he did unto the great and mighty Armies of the King of <HI>Ca∣naan.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/> And the People of the ever-blessed <HI>Jehovah</HI> have with them al∣ways whole Hosts of glorious Angels and invisible Spirits, for to take their part against the Enemy of God and his Truth. But which is yet a farther Addition to the Churches comfort, That if her Enemies be better provided for War, and prepar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for Battel seemingly and externally, yet nevertheless the most holy and terrible Majesty of Hea∣ven and Earth, who is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>all in all,</HI> and without whom all other helps and means are invalid and insignificant, is of (a cer∣tain) departed and gone from them, and their Idolatrous and Super∣stitious Camp. As we may collect, from the Record of the Spirit of Truth, which says, What Concord hath Christ with <HI>Belial?</HI> And what Agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? Oh! can we ima∣gine, that the most holy One (who charges the Angels with Folly, and is of purer Eyes, than to behold evil) will abide or continue there, and among such a People where the Glory which is due unto none but him alone, is day by day given another, and his Praise to graven Images? See <HI>Isa</HI> 42. 8. It cannot be thought justly of him, for he is a jealous God, and when he doth visit, he will do it to the purpose. But on the other hand it cannot be denied, but that the omnipotent <HI>Jehovah</HI> may seemingly withdraw his Presence, and hide his blessed Face for a small Moment, from his Church, which is the only Excellency wherein he delights, and as dear to him as the very Apple of his own Eye: Yet, be it known, that he will never fail nor forsake her, but rejoyce over her as a Bridegroom doth over his Bride; and will give her his holy Spirit to comfort her, and guide her into all Truth: Nay he will be with her always even unto the end of the World. And this leaving of his Church for a while, is for her everlasting good, for the Tryal of her Faith, Patience and Constancy, which is more precious than of Gold that perishes, tho' it be tryed by Fire. That she may be found a holy and reform'd Church without Spot, and Blameless, unto Praise, and Honour and Glory, at the appearing of her dear Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 7. And since the Lord of Hosts himself is our Portion and Inheritance, our best and only Help and Strength, our safest Defence and Horn of Salvation, on whom alone we wholly depend, in these deceitful Days, wherein no trust is to be given to Man: Then there is no cause for us to be cast down, or any ways dismayed, at the blasphemous Speeches of any wicked <HI>Rabshaketh,</HI> or at the Pride and Arrogancy of an Idolatrous <HI>Sennacherib:</HI> Tho' he hath laid waste some small Towns and Villages that are adjacent unto his Territories, and reproached his Maker, the
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> everliving God. O tarry ye the Lord's leisure with Meekness and Patience, ye Children of the most-high! For yet a little while and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Oh the Thoughts of the most Just and Terrible God are not as ours, and his ways are past finding out! For there's no doubt of it, but he suffers him to fulfil the number of his Sins, and fill up the measure of his Transgressions, which are not (perhaps) full ripe for Judgment. And then he will cause his own Terribleness inevitably to deceive him, and the Pride of his own evil Heart to lay him low, in an Hour that he is not aware of; as his did (sometimes) to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> King of <HI>Babylon;</HI> while the very Word was in his Mouth: And who can tell but that his Day is come, and that happy time is at hand, wherein the most terrible Majesty of the eternal King, the mighty Lord, will call him to an ac∣count for all his Wickedness, and the Blood of his Saints and dear Children, which he spilt like Water, and will shew his Power on him, by making him to know and feel, That the Most-high ruleth in the King∣dom of Men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will; And none can stay his Hand, or say unto him, What dost thou? Nay will compel him at last to confess with <HI>Adonibezek,</HI> saying, As I have done, so God hath requited me, <HI>Dan. 4. 25, 35. Judg.</HI> 1. 7. What mean then all these causless and unjust Murmurings and Complainings in our Streets, which I hear about the Times? Know ye not what the Preach∣er speaks? Say not thou, What is the cause that the former Days were better than these? For thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7. 10. What's the Matter (O foolish People and unwise) that ye have not Patience to wait God's time? Do not ye understand this, That you cannot have an Apple or a Nut, but you must tarry its proper Period, and let it bud and blossom, and knit and grow and ripen? And does not the Apostle tell thee, That the Husbandman waits with long Patience for the precious Fruits of the Earth? And must you be impatient and limit God in his own Work? It is a grief to think on it, that there are a sort of People among us, which are not unlike to those Spies; apt to bring an evil Report upon their Ma∣jesties Forces by Sea and Land, and extolling the <HI>French</HI> in all Com∣pany always wheresoever they go: Sure such are evil-minded and un∣believing Hearts. The Spies said, The Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was a Land which did eat up its Inhabitants, and all the People thereof were Gi∣ants, or Men of a great Stature: And so persuaded the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> they were not able to go up against them, they were so strong. Thus they consider'd not that the most high God was with them whi∣thersoever
<PB N="10" REF="8"/> they went; that he was their Defence and Strength, and fought all their Battels: Whereupon they provoked him to Wrath against 'em, and he destroyed those Spies and false Reporters before his Face, by the Plague, for their evil Reports; and sware that not one of them which had seen his Glory and Miracles, which he wrought in <HI>Egypt</HI> and in the Wilderness, and yet for all murmured and complain∣ed against his Deputies, <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> should enter into the Land, but die in the Wilderness, for their Unbelief (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave his Servants <HI>Ca∣leb</HI> and <HI>Joshua.</HI>) In like manner our false Reporters, Murmurers and Complainers, cry, Ah we shall be all ruin'd and undone by the <HI>French!</HI> And tho' they do not say they are Giants, yet all their Cry is, They are too strong for us; not considering that the Almighty God is our Defence. Depart then from among God's People, ye evil and unbelieving Hearts; for you weaken the Hands of the Almighty, and discourage his People as much as you can. But let me tell you to your Faces, That the mighty God hath deliver'd our Nation sundry times out of far greater Dangers, than (I hope) we are now in: And sure I am that the Lord's Hand is not shortned, that he cannot save us now, as well as he hath done in our Fathers and Fore-fathers days: Yea, not long since, in our own Remembrance; if our crying Nati∣onal Sins, our Murmurings, Complainings without cause, and our wicked and unbelieving Hearts, do not hinder him. Be warn'd then by the Example of the Spies, ye false Reporters, and ye Murmurers and Complainers, by the <HI>Israelites;</HI> lest you provoke the most-high God to Anger, and make him swear in his Wrath, That none of you all, which have either seen with your Eyes, or heard with your Ears, the many great Deliverances which the Lord of Hosts hath wrought for this Kingdom, before our time, but more especially not many years since, by the Hands of our most gracious K. <HI>William,</HI> that mighty Prince of Valour, whom the Lord hath raised up for to be a Deliverer of his reform'd Church, shall ever be so happy, as to live to see or hear of Mercy and Truth met together, and Righteousness and Peace to em∣brace each other, in all parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Oh be asham'd and blush, ye false Reporters, and causless and unjust Murmurers and Complainers, and give the Lord the Praises due unto his most holy Name; and ren∣der unto the King the Honour and Obedience which is due unto his Majesty, who hath graciously given you your Lives for a Prey, when as ye were appointed as Sheep to the Slaughter! Good God! Where∣fore doth a living Man now complain? Whereas not long since you would willingly have given all that you had for your Lives and
<PB N="11" REF="8"/> Safety. And do ye now grudg to pay a little Mony towards the War? Is it possible that Christians should be thus ungrateful and for∣get their Danger so soon, and be willing to return again into <HI>Egypt?</HI> (I mean) Are you willing to be reduc'd to Popery, Slavery and Ar∣bitrary Power again? Or rather, to be in subjection to <HI>French</HI> Dra∣goons? God forbid: Search then and try your ways, and meddle no more with our blessed Governors and Government, which does not concern you: But busie your Heads about your own Occasions, and turn thus again unto the Lord: And then we have no cause to fear, but that God, even our own God, shall give this Kingdom his Blessing: God shall bless their Majesties and their Forces, and prosper their Arms both by Sea and Land, and all the ends of the World shall fear him; because they shall see or hear of the mighty Salvation, which he hath wrought for his Church and People.</P>
<P>Secondly, This may caution and admonish the whole Nation in ge∣neral (but in a more especial manner you that belong to the Fleet or Army) in this most deceitful Age of ours, for to take heed and be∣ware of all disaffected and treacherous Persons, which have no fear of God before their Eyes; and therefore will make it no scruple of Conscience to start aside from their Duty and Allegiance, unto their present Majesties, like a deceitful Bow, upon the first occasion. And let me declare my Mind freely, and tell you, That I am persuaded there are not a few, who have listed themselves in this present Ser∣vice, both by Sea and Land, on meer purpose (as <HI>Joab</HI> speaks of <HI>Ab∣ner</HI> to King <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 3. 25.) to deceive their Majesties, and to know their going out and their coming in, and to know all that they do; and what Forces they have by Sea and Land in a readiness; and then to inform the Enemy therewith the first opportunity. And therefore I may boldly say, you that are gone forth to War, cannot be too circumspect and diligent, in searching the Minds and Hearts of all those employed in the Service. And to further you herein, we beseech the great Searcher of all Hearts and Tryer of the Reins, for to discover all evil and disaffected Persons and private Traytors daily, both by Sea and Land; that so they may be put to Shame and Confusion. And we will heartily pray, That the everlasting Arms may be underneath their Majesties King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> that they may be compass'd about with the Favour and Protection of the Almighty, and prosper in all their ways: But let all their Enemies, O our God, fall down and flee before them and their Arms! <HI>Amen.</HI> What can Rebels expect at the Hands of the Immortal King, which
<PB N="12" REF="9"/> is immutable and most faithful? But that he should command such unfaithful Persons to be bound Hand and Foot, and cast among their Fellows, the Apostate Angels, there to be kept in everlasting Chains, under Darkness, and to dwell with devouring Fire and everlasting Burnings. For the terrible and most holy God declares to us, That he equally abhors both the Blood thirsty and deceitful treacherous Man: And wise <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, That whoso▪provoketh the King to Wrath, and is deceitful to him, Sins against his own Soul, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20. 2. He means thus, That the Soul of a Traytor shall suffer in the World to come, altho' his Body may escape it here on Earth. For be it known unto all Men, That a King that rules in the fear of the Lord, and according to the Truth of his holy Word, can never be honour'd or obey'd enough by his Subjects; and ought to be priz'd as dear unto that Kingdom, as the Eye to the Body; and is as necessary for its Prosperity as the Sun is to the Firmament, which gives both Light and Life, and makes all the Earth become fruitful. That Counsel of <HI>Ve∣getius</HI> unto a Prince, is not to be despised; What you have to do, con∣fer with many; what ye will do, with very few, or none but your own self: For there are no better Counsels, than those which the Enemy knoweth not, before they are put in Execution. But to speak to you that are employ'd by their Majesties in this Holy War, Let me charge you, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Elect An∣gels, for to hold fast your Loyalty, your Allegiance and Obedience unto our gracious King and Queen, without wavering: And make it one part of your business for to provoke one another daily thereunto, now in these evil Days (above all other times) and so much the more as you see or hear of the hour of Battel approaching: Wherein I I question not, but the strong God, will manifest his great Power and mighty Arm unto the World, and especially against your Enemies, in your behalf, if you do but trust in him, and call upon him duly by Prayer.</P>
<P>But in the next place, as this ought to caution and admonish every one in the whole Nation, to beware of disaffected Persons and Tray∣tors: So in a more peculiar manner to take good heed of provoking the most-high God to Anger, against us or our Hosts, by our unre∣pented of and unmortified Sins. We know that Righteousness ex∣alteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People: And for it the Land it self mourns, and the Fleet and Army is in no small danger; because the weight of our National Transgressions, do out-weigh others (I am affraid) in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
<P>Oh that all persons then from the highest to the lowest would but seriously turn to God, with Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning! Oh that the whole Nation, would but be of one Mind and Heart, upon our Solemn Fast Days; and wrestle with God by Prayer, as <HI>Jacob</HI> did with the Angel, and not let him go, until he had blessed us, and our Forces! I would to God, I could prevail with you all, for to consider the case of the Murmuring, complaining, unbelieving <HI>Israelites;</HI> and so to be warn'd and repent. For doth not the Apostle tell us, in most plain Words; That these things happened unto the <HI>Israelites</HI> for Ex∣amples, and are Written for our Admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come? (Mark) That we should not be Idolaters, as were some of them; That we should not commit Fornication, as did some of them, and fell in one Day three and twenty Thousand: That we should not swear, or take the Name of God in vain as did some of them, and were destroyed of the destroyer: That we should not have in us evil Hearts of unbelief and so provoke the Majesty of Heaven, to refuse to go forth with our Hosts, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 6. to 12. There are three Vices, or Sins, especially above all others (noted by Historians) which bring danger, and publick Punishment, and Calamity unto a Kingdom or People, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Ungodliness, Injustice, and Luxurious∣ness. Ungodliness troubleth the Church, Injustice the vulgar People; and Luxuriousness private Families: And the hurt in special, re∣dounds to the whole Nation. Therefore, <HI>Salmoxes</HI> Counsel is not amiss, saying, that these Things should by all means be avoided, by every one that fears God (namely) Sluggishness from the Body, Ig∣norance from the Mind, Gluttony from the Belly, Sedition and Faction from the Church and Nation, Discord from the Family, Disloyalty and Treachery from the Governours and Government, Intemperance from all things, and above all other, Sin and Iniquity from every true Chris∣tian. Oh that these Rules were but generally followed, and practis'd throughout our whole Nation, that so the everlasting Father of Lights might prosper us in our Labours and Arms.</P>
<P>But, let me address my self in a more especial manner, unto you who are gone forth to warr against the Enemy: You have heard here, how the People of <HI>Israel</HI> provoked the infinite Majesty of Heaven and Earth to Wrath, by their evil Ways, and sinful Actions; and caused the most Great and Terrible God▪ (who was their Helper and Defen∣der) to depart from them, and leave them to the will of their Enemies, insomuch that they were smitten of them, sundrie times. Oh! that this may be a warning unto all, from the highest to the lowest: And an effectual argument, to prevail with every one of you, both Officers
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> and Souldiers, for to leave off your most horrid Oaths, your prophane Speeches, your dissolute Actions, your intemperate drinkings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to give your selves wholly unto the contrary Virtues; As to the de∣nying all Ungodliness, and Worldly Lusts; And to live soberly, Righ∣teously and Godly the remainder of your Days: And if you do thus, then you may justly hope for the Blessing of God Almighty, upon your endeavours, and (upon good Ground) expect to prosper in that employment whereunto ye are called. But, if you still do wickedly; If you still continue in Sin, and disobey the Commandments of God, Can you reasonably think that the Lord of Hosts, will abide with you; or take your part against the Enemy? Oh no, he is a most just, and Holy God, who will by no means clear the guilty: But will execute the fierceness of his Wrath against you, until he hath destroyed you from off the Face of the Earth, and blotted out your Names from un∣der Heaven. We have the Testimony of the Holy Ghost for this and many examples in the Sacred Scriptures: As the old World which was drown'd, <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> destroyed with Fire and Brimstone from Heaven; The <HI>Galileans,</HI> on whom the Tower of <HI>Siloam</HI> fell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then in Prophane History, we Read that in the third Year, after that <HI>Pompey</HI> had won <HI>Jerusalem (Valerius Gracchus,</HI> being President of <HI>Judea</HI>) a certain Jew, came to the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> for to complain of the grievances, and injustice done in that Country, by their Ma∣gistrates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And among other expressions, he spake thus. O Learn∣ed Fathers! O happy People! your Blessed Destinies that favour'd you, and our angry God, who hath forsaken us for our Sins, hath now made the famous Metropolitan City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> once the Commander of all <HI>Asia,</HI> and Mother of the Jews, Subject and Servant unto <HI>Rome,</HI> and to you Romans. Great indeed was the Courage and Power of <HI>Pompey,</HI> and great was his Army that overcame us. But I will tell you, much greater was the Wrath and Fury of our God; And with∣out comparison, the Number of our Sins, for which we have deserved to be utterly overthrown. It is worthy to be noted by you all, that whatsoever People, or Nation, Fleet, or Army, doth press the Lord down most, with the Weight and Burden of Sin; That Nation, or People, shall be sure to feel most of Gods heavy▪ Hand upon it, <HI>Amos</HI> 2. 13. And thus the Justice of the most High will perform, for it is gone out of his Lips, and he cannot Reverse it, That he will render unto a People according to its deservings. Therefore it high∣ly concerns the whole Nation in general; and you (of the Fleet and Army) in particular, for to give Glory to the Lord our God, before
<PB N="15" REF="10"/> he cause Darkness of Calamity or Captivity; and before our Feet Stum∣ble upon the Dark Mountains; and while we look for Light: Lest he turn it into the Shadow of Death, and make it gross Darkness, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13. 16. The Prophets meaning is thus, according to Bishop <HI>Tayler</HI> upon it. Repent of all your Wickedness, before the Almighty come to search and find us out, by his heavy Judgments; And that while we have time and opportunity afforded us: And this is the only means (through the Blood of Jesus Christ) for to appease Divine Wrath, <HI>Revel.</HI> 16. 9. And they repented not to give Glory to God. Oh let us all then be perswaded to break off all our Sins, by Righteousness; for it may be a lengthening of our Happiness, and an Infallible Means to cause the Lord to destroy our Enemies. Rebel not ye against, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, that God only, is the best and safest defence of his Church against her Adversaries. And this Truth may appear (1) From the Attributes and Titles of God, in the Holy Scriptures, and (2) By the manifold deliverances of his Church and People in all Ages, of the World. First from the Attributes, and Titles of God; He is most Holy, and therefore in the first place, we may with great safety trust in him, and rely on his Word and Promise, for help in time of trouble, and he will deliver us. For this is no mean Comfort unto his Church, that the Lord is Righteous in all his Ways, and Holy in all his Works: And therefore he will not forsake a Holy Nation, nor a Re∣penting Praying People. He never leaves off a Kingdom unto it self, until it first leaveth him by unholyness and filthy conversation; and therefore (I Pray) let us all Worship the Lord, with a Holy Wor∣ship. Secondly, he is most Wise, and therefore no Policy or Sub∣tilty of his Adversaries can inveigle him: He sees all their Snares, and Conspiracies, and all their secret Thoughts, and hath them in derision: For he taketh the Wise in their own Craftiness, and maketh Diviners mad.</P>
<P>Thirdly, he is most able, and of greatest Power and Might; and hence he encourages his Servant <HI>Abraham,</HI> saying, I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17 1. Then for his Ti∣tles; He is called <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or rather <HI>Jehueh,</HI> which signifies his being is of himself, <HI>Esa.</HI> 42. 8. and he is called <HI>Elohim,</HI> which denotes the Glo∣rious Trinity, <HI>Elohim, Bara;</HI> The Mighty God, or the three Persons in the Trinity, <HI>Ben, Rua, Ab,</HI> the Son, the Spirit, and the Father. He is called, <HI>El,</HI> which is as much, as strong God, and signifies, That God is not only most strong, and Fortitude it self in his own Essence: But it is he alone that gives Strength and Power unto all his People; and
<PB N="16" REF="11"/> hence t'was, that the Holy and Blessed Jesus in his Agony on the Cross, Cried out, <HI>Eloi, Eloi,</HI> which in the Syrian Tongue signifies my strong God, my strong God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He is called in another place, <HI>Shaddai,</HI> which is Almighty; the <HI>Septuagint</HI> Translates it by, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, it is a derivative Word, and comes from <HI>Dai,</HI> sufficiency, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Essentia qua sibi suisque sufficit;</HI> And of <HI>Shad,</HI> a Dug or Breast: To signifie, that God is all-sufficient and able to supply the wants and necessities of his Children, whatsoever they are, like the huge Ocean, which fills every Creek; which the Shallow narrow Rivulets of the Creatures largest and best perfections cannot do. Hence the Church says, the Lord is her Portion and therefore she will hope in him, <HI>Lamen.</HI> 3. 24. And <HI>David</HI> says his People shall not want any thing that is good. Another Title of God is, <HI>Jah;</HI> and this is given to him, when he hath wrought some Notable Deliverance; and therefore says the Psalmist, Extol him that Rideth upon the Heavens, by his Name <HI>Jah,</HI> and Rejoyce before him, <HI>Psal</HI> 68. 4. And again, the Lord is my Rock and my Fortress, and my Deliverer; The God of my Rock, in him will I trust: he is my Shield, and the Horn of my Salvation, my high Tower, and my Refuge my Saviour, <HI>&amp;c. 2 Sam.</HI> 22. 2, 3. Who then can be a Defence like unto God Almighty, who hath always in a readiness, for the help and Redemp∣tion of his Church and People out of the greatest dangers, and to Res∣cue them out of the Hands of their most inveterate Enemies at his own Pleasure, (besides his own Omnipotent Arm, the least Finger whereof can beat down the strongest Mountain to Powder, and rend the Flin∣tiest Rock into Pieces) innumerable Hosts, or Armies of Angels, one of which killed in the Camp of the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> one Hundred fourscore and five Thousand in one Night, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 19. 35. Chariots of Fire, even a Thousand Thousand, in the Whirlwind? That fair Glorious Giant, which with incredible swiftness runs, Day by Day, Post through the Heavens, for to stand still, or retire, as it did at <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Command. The impetuous Current of the raging Sea, to recoyl or go back: The Mer∣ciless Flames of the hungry Fire to become a sweet refreshing Air: The implacable Fury of the most enraged Lions, to Couch at the first Word, for his Servants sake and safety: Nay, if need be, the great and terrible God, hath Caterpillars and Frogs, Worms and Lice, even those im∣potent silly Creatures for to fetch Blood, and pull down the Pride and Heart of the most Rebellious <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and to eat out the very Bowels of the most cruel <HI>Herod,</HI> see <HI>Acts.</HI> 12. 23. And immediately the An∣gel of the Lord smote him, and he was eaten of Worms, and gave up the Ghost.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
<P>Secondly, By the manifold Deliverances of his Church and People in all Ages of the World, we have a Cloud of Witnesses to confirm this: But I shall confine my self unto some few. Was not the Almighty only, the best Defence unto righteous <HI>Noah</HI> in that terrible Flood which drown'd all the World, except 8 Persons? To the Patriarchs, <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob?</HI> To <HI>Abraham</HI> against <HI>Abimelech</HI> King of <HI>Gerar;</HI> and also when he rescued his Brother <HI>Lot</HI> out of the Hands of the Enemies? To <HI>Isaac,</HI> when he was ta∣ken and bound, and laid upon the Altar just ready to be sacrificed by <HI>Abra∣ham;</HI> yea, so near the point was he, that his Fathers hand was lifted up with the Knife, but yet an Angel of the Lord stayed him. To <HI>Jacob</HI> against <HI>Esau</HI> his Brother, and <HI>Laban</HI> his Father in Law. Unto the Seed of <HI>Jacob,</HI> or Peo∣ple of <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the Wilderness. Unto <HI>Moses</HI> in the Bulrushes, <HI>David</HI> in <HI>Saul</HI>'s Court, and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>Baruch</HI> against <HI>Jehoiakim</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> when he sent to destroy them for their Prophesies; for tho' they were commanded to hide themselves, yet its said, <HI>The Lord hid them,</HI> Jer. 36. 19, 26. Alas! our own hiding will not do, it must be Gods; our now clasp∣ing our Arms about our selves, is the ready way to drown us; whereas spreading our Hands forth to Heaven, may save us. Then in the new Testament, Was not the Lord of Hosts the best Defence unto <HI>Peter,</HI> when he was kept in Prison by four Quaternons of Soldiers? To <HI>Paul</HI> when he deliver'd him out of the Lion's Mouth, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 17. And what are the <HI>121st.</HI> and <HI>124th. Psalms,</HI> but a Confirmation of this Truth? Does not the Church say, If the Lord himself had not been on our side, when Men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick when they were so wrath∣fully displeased at us? But to come down to Examples in the last Century of the World; Was not the great and mighty God, the best Defence to Q. <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> (of blessed Memory) and these Kingdoms; when all <HI>Europe</HI> con∣spired together against her, and sent the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet (which was term'd the Invincible Armado, by reason of its Strength and number of Ships) for to overthrow her, and introduce Popery into this Nation? But alas! how suddenly was this great Fleet overcome and dispers'd, here and there about the <HI>British</HI> Seas, by her grand Defence, even our God! To K. <HI>James</HI> I. and our Nation, when that horrid Powder Plot was discover'd, and laid open by the unsearchable Wisdom and Goodness of the Lord; that cruel Plot, I say, which was hatch'd in Hell, and carried on with the greatest Secrets, by those Engins of <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> and Soul-Deceivers and Murderers, the Jesuits and Priests of the <HI>Roman</HI> Faction, which said, God and Man had concur'd to punish the Iniquity of the Times. But to come to some Examples in our Days, which our Eyes have seen, and Ears heard. Oh was not the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> the best Defence of that mighty Prince of Valour (now our graci∣ous K. <HI>William</HI>) and his whole Fleet, in the midst of very a terrible Storm, raised, no doubt, by the Prince of the Power of the Air, on behalf of his Chil∣dren
<PB N="18" REF="12"/> of Darkness, to obstruct our Landing? But the mighty God and ter∣rible, was with us, and deliver'd us all from the Peril of the Seas, bringing us back to <HI>Hell-voot</HI> Sluce. And after that we had offer'd to him there, the Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving, for so merciful a Deliverance, and tarried there about 11 days, then did Almighty God send us a fair Wind, which brought us all safely into <HI>Torbay,</HI> where our most renown'd and bles∣sed Prince landed. And we were no sooner come into the <HI>Bay,</HI> but the everlasting Arms were about us, and changed the Wind, which hindred our then Adversaries from pursuing us. Who dares deny bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this was the Lords own doing, and ought not to be forgotten of this Nation, but to be marvellous in our Eyes? For here was the Finger of God, as our very Ene∣mies confess'd. And afterwards when we were come to <HI>Exeter,</HI> how won∣derfully did the Almighty turn the Hearts of this whole Nation, and the op∣posite Army, as the Heart of one Man, towards this most valorous and mighty Prince, insomuch that very little or no Blood was shed in this blessed and glorious Revolution! Again, was not the living and true God, the best De∣fence unto our most gracious Sovereign Lord K. <HI>William</HI> and his Army, when he passed the River at <HI>Drogheda</HI> (vulgarly called the River <HI>Boyn</HI>) when as the Enemy was so advantagiously encamped: Yet how soon did the Lord strike Terror into all their Hearts, and they fled before us? Oh there is no question to be made, but that the eternal Majesty of Heaven and Earth shelter'd our gracious King under his mighty Wings, and encom∣pass'd him about with his Favour and Protection; and we hope and pray that he will still do so unto him for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Here is then a very sharp Reproof unto all wicked and unbelieving Hearts, who are even distracted and at their Wits end, at the very noise of a giddy Multitude: As if the everliving and terrible Majesty of Heaven and Earth, even the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Hand was shortned: As if he was not as able to bless and preserve their most excellent Majesties, in these days, as he was in our Fore-fathers time. Or, as if he could not cover them and this Nation with the mighty Wings of his Providence, from all Perils and Dangers of the Enemy now, as he hath done all along. Oh take notice then, all ye faint-hearted, faithlels and unbelieving Souls, of those words of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> Chap. 32. 18, 19, 27. Behold I am the great, the mighty God, the Lord of Hosts is my Name. I am the God of all Flesh, great in Counsel and mighty in Work: Is there any thing too hard for me? Are you so foolish and unwise as to think, that all the Plots, Conspiracies and Devices, which are against my faithful Servants (who fulfil my Will) shall ever prevail? Do you imagine that I, who am the most just and righ∣teous Governor of the World, do not regard those my Deputies, which rule according to the Truth of my holy Word, and are a Terror to the Evil, and a Praise to them that do well? I tell you plainly, That no Wea∣pon
<PB N="19" REF="12"/> form'd against such holy Princes shall prosper: For I who am the great King of Heaven and Earth, will certainly pull down all such as walk con∣trary to my Laws; and I will bring to nought the Adversaries of my Church, like Lambs to the Slaughter. And the mighty Men of <HI>Babylon</HI> shall tremble for fear, and forbear to fight: They shall remain in their Holds and in their Camps, their Might and Strength shall fail 'em, and they shall be beaten and destroyed. One Post shall run to meet another, and one Mes∣senger shall hasten to meet his Fellow: To shew the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the great and terrible Works of the most high God, what Desolations or what an Overthrow the Lord (whose Name is <HI>Jehovah</HI>) hath wrought for his own Heritage, against their Adversaries. And then shall Tidings be spread through the Earth, that the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Forces by Sea and Land, are utterly confounded. For every purpose of the Lord against <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> King of <HI>Babylon</HI> shall be perform'd; to make him know and feel, that God alone is to be feared throughout the whole Earth. And tho' he hath devour'd the Heritage of the Lord, yet his Heart shall melt away for fear, and for those things which are coming upon him, <HI>Jer.</HI> 51. 30, 31, 33, 40. Alas! what if the Adversaries of the Lord have gotten a second <HI>Chrysippus</HI> among 'em, which probably may be able to speak well of every thing? Or what if they have a second <HI>Achitophel?</HI> But to go higher, What if they have a second <HI>Aristotle,</HI> or a second <HI>Solomon?</HI> Yet still so long as we have the Almighty, most ter∣rible and all wise for our Defence, who is the Fountain of all Wisdom and Knowledg, and the Giver of Courage and Strength, Deliverance and Sal∣vation, we need not to care. Suppose we want some of the Beams, so we have but the Sun it self: And what matter is it, if we want some of the Streams, when we have the pure Spring? Nay, corrupt Streams and mud∣dy, and deceitful Branches are very unwholesome and infectious unto the Body Politick; and therefore if they are dryed up or wasted, we need not to care. But now for the Church of God to hold fast together, and to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, with one Heart in one place, is a very good and joyful thing, and no doubt exceeding acceptable in the sight of God our heavenly Father. And I hope every one that hath the fear of God before his Eyes, and the least regard to the welfare of their Majesties and their Kingdoms, or to their own Salvation, will not be remiss in joyning with the Church in Prayer, upon our solemn Fast-days. For tho' it cannot be denied, but that the effectual fervent Prayer of one righteous Man, avails much; yet it must be granted, that the joynt Prayers of a Congregation, or rather of the whole Church, prevail infinitely more. One Stick may make a Fire, but many Sticks put together will make a great and hot Fire: One String of an Instrument may make a sound, but many Strings a melodious Har∣mony. One single Prayer in our Closets may be a Sacrifice, but the Pray∣ers of a whole Kingdom makes a Sacrifice to God, of a sweet smelling Sa∣vour;
<PB N="20" REF="13"/> and therefore the <HI>Psalmist</HI> calls the publick Prayers of the Church, a worshipping of the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness, <HI>Psal.</HI> 29. 2. We read of those Worthies how couragious they were, for to keep Faith and a good Conscience: Yea, so valiant for the Lord's cause, that they loved not their Lives unto Death. Hence, says that Champion of the Apostles, None of these things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my self, so that I may finish my Course with Joy, <HI>&amp;c. Saviat persequendo, nihil in me moritur nisi mortale, erit in me aliquid ubi persecutor pervenire non possit, ubi Deus meus habitat.</HI> Let Man be never so sharp in persecuting, yet nothing dies in me, but what is mortal: Nevertheless there will be something in me, at which the cruel Persecutor cannot come; where my blessed God dwelleth. Whom have I in Heaven but thee (O Lord) and there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee!</P>
<P>But as this reproves all wicked and unbelieving Hearts, so in the next place, it is no small Encouragement, unto all the Servants of the most high God, for to fear him and serve him in Truth, with a perfect Heart and willing Mind. For it is an undeniable Assertion, That such a Kingdom or People, cannot be moved or shaken by any terrible Blasts of the Devil or his Instruments, who hath the eternal Lord for its Strength and Defence. And I may truly say, that there are no times so very Perillous, nor Days so very Evil, but that they may be made easie and happy unto every Child of God, and Believer in Jesus Christ. I mean, the dangerousness and bad∣ness of these times (which many groundlesly and unjustly complain of) may be reduced to an equality, with the Peace, Safety and Comfort of better times: Yea, may be made equal unto the best of Days, which this present World commonly affords unto the Church militant. As the sharp∣ness of a very cold and pinching Season, may (by a proportionable addi∣tion of warm Cloathes, the use of good Fires, and the like) be made as little offensive to a Man's Constitution, as a temperate Season is: Or as a Man who is shut up close in a most strong or impregnable Castle, and is there sufficiently provided and stored with all things necessary; as Men, Arms, Mony, Powder, Ball, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Is in as much or rather more safety and freer from all danger (altho' he be encompassed about and besieged by his inveterate and implacable Enemies at the same time) than another Man is, who hath no Enemies at all, seemingly near him. In like manner, when once a Man hath the great and mighty God for his Defence, and the co∣vering of his Almighty Wings spreading over him and underneath him, the everlasting Arms which <HI>Moses</HI> speaks of, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 27. Then what Bul∣lets soever are flying about him, what Cannons soever are roaring against him, what Storms soever are rising, what Waves or Billows soever are raging, what Enemies soever are Plotting, yea, what Perils or Dangers soever he may be seemingly in; yet notwithstanding all, he is most safe,
<PB N="21" REF="13"/> he is most secure in God, who is a firm Rock, near a most raging Sea; a sure Shield amidst Showers of invenom'd Darts. And 'tis one and the same thing unto such a Man, for to be in the very midst of a Battel, either by Sea or Land, among the thundring Guns and Showers of small Shot, which falls round about him like Hail; as to be in the Walks of a most plea∣sant Garden, and hear the sweetest singing of Birds. The sound of Ala∣rum by a Drum or Trumpet, is as acceptable to him, as the voice of the Turtle: Because he can always, and in every place, rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his Salvation, as the Church does, <HI>Hab.</HI> 3. 18. Alas! A Man can but be safe, a Man can but be secure, and at rest and ease in his Mind, if he lived in those halcion Days, or golden Times, prophesied of by the Psalmist▪ When the Mountains shall bring Peace to the People, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttle Hills Righteousness, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72. 3. That is to say, when neither High nor Low, King nor People, shall be troublesome one to another, nor disturb each other: But the Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf and the young Lion, and the fatling together, and a little Child shall lead them. Verily the condition of a true Child of Light and Heir of Glory, (be he in the Wars either by Sea or by Land, abroad or at home) is always thus blessed and happy, thus at ease and rest in his own Breast and Conscience, because he is kept in perfect Peace, by him who is the Prince of Peace. Whereas 'tis far otherwise with an ungodly wicked Man, who is like the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose Waters cast up Mire and Dirt. There is no Peace, saith my God, to the Wicked. You then that are gone forth to War, against the Enemies of the Lord and his Church, whether you are by Land or by Water, let me beseech you in Christ's stead and for his sake, to receive this wholsome and profitable Advice, and let it take deep Root in all your Hearts, and be continually in your Mind. Trust ye in the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> for ever, for in the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> is everlasting Strength; for he bringeth down them that are Proud, and exalteth the Humble and Meek, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 4. 5. What could you wish for more than Strength? Yes, but here is everlasting Strength. What could you desire more than Defence? Yes, But here is Defence and Safety, Courage and a Blessing. Oh our gracious and merciful God hath always some Twigs left, for to preserve and keep his elect People above Water, when they suspect themselves to be most in danger. For he hath either the Castle of his Providence, the Ark of his Promise, or the All sufficiency of his Grace and Goodness, for the safety and retirement of his Children and Servants, in the greatest of Storms: How did he defend <HI>David</HI> and his little Company, when <HI>Saul</HI> and his Army had almost encompassed him about? Alas! you must expect to meet with some rubs in your way towards the Celestial <HI>Canaan,</HI> and through many Tribulations you must enter into the Kingdom of God: <HI>Non est ad astra
<PB N="22" REF="14"/> mollis e terris via;</HI> all true Christians know well, that the Church is mili∣tant here on Earth, and therefore the Saints commonly sow here in Tears, that they may reap hereafter in Joy: We must all expect to fight the Lords Battel here on Earth, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> terms a good sight; that we may ac∣quire the Victory and receive our Crown of Righteousness and Glory in Heaven, where there is no Enemy or Opposition; for all are there of one Mind and Heart, praising God with Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost. Here we must all run the Christian Race which is set before us, by our Lord and Saviour, with Patience and Alacrity; that we may obtain the Prize, or that Incorruptible Crown, which the Lord the righteous Judg bestows on such. Here is the place appointed for us to work in, while it is day; or rather the Lord's Vineyard. But in the Kingdom of Heaven are we to expect, and receive our Wages when our Work is done, or our Course finished: For there is the rest which remains for the People of God. Wherefore then should any rational Soul think to find that in this World, which God hath reserv'd for the World to come, when we shall see him Face to Face? Oh what Fleet or Army is there on Earth, or in the whole World, that can harm you, if ye be Followers of God, as dear Children, and Doers of that which is good and well-pleasing in his Sight? What hu∣man Force or Power can possibly be able to stand before, or against you, if your Hearts are but perfect towards God? For the Eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, to shew himself strong in the be∣half of them, whose Hearts are perfect towards him; and who sincerely endeavour to walk in his Laws, which he set before us, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16. 9. Therefore let me desire of you all for to take heed now, above all other Times, that your Hearts be perfect towards God and his Church, towards our most gracious Sovereign Lord and Lady, King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> towards the good and welfare of our Land and Nation; and in the last place towards one another; that Officers may love the Soldiers un∣der their Command, and the Soldiers be obedient and faithful unto their Officers: And then the Lord of Hosts will bless and prosper you whither∣soever ye go, and in whatsoever you do. But on the other Hand, if ye Backbite and Quarrel, and prove Treacherous one to another, ye shall be destroyed one of another: For they are the Words of none other but our great Lord and Master himself: That a Kingdom, a House, or Army, or Fleet, divided against it self cannot stand, but must fall into Desolation. And hence we find, that the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> said unto <HI>Joshua</HI> their Captain and Governour, That whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy Com∣mandment, and will not hearken unto thy Words in all that thou com∣mandest him, he shall be put to death, <HI>Josh. 1. ult.</HI> Whosoever he be that proves treacherous to our blessed Governors and present Government, and will not obey their Majesties order in all Punctilio's, he shall be dealt with
<PB N="23" REF="14"/> as a Rebel and Traytor, and no regard had to his Commission, because he hath proved disloyal to his Prince. This is the Law of the most high God, concerning this Matter: Therfore <HI>Rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the People of the,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thirdly and Lastly, That to fear the Lord of Hosts himself, and not the Arm of Flesh, or to be very Couragious in fighting God's Battel, is a Duty required of all his People (but especially of those which are called thereunto by Lawful Authority) and a principal means for to keep the Lord with or among such a People or Army. The truth of this Lesson we may see confirm'd to us in the case of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> here in this Chapter of our Text. For we read, that they, by their Fear and Faint-hearted∣ness, by their Unbelief and Cowardise (when God had commanded them not to fear or to be affraid at the outward Strength and Power of their Enemies, the <HI>Amorites</HI> and <HI>Canaanites</HI>) thereby tempted the Lord, and provoked him to Wrath, because he was their Strength and Defence, and fought all their Battels, insomuch that he forsook 'em and departed: Whereupon the Prophet <HI>Moses</HI> tells them, that they should not prosper. For the Lord is not among you, and therefore go not up against the Ene∣my (says he) lest you be smitten of them: And so they were indeed, when God their Helper and Defender was not with them; see <HI>vers.</HI> 41, 42, 44, 45. So the Lord of Hosts, the mighty God and terrible, sent his Spirit upon <HI>Jahaziel,</HI> and commanded him to tell <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> saying, Thus saith the Lord unto you, be not affraid nor be dismayed, by reason of this great Multitude; for the Battel is not yours, but Gods. To morrow go out very Couragiously against them, for the Lord will be with you, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 17. Again, the Almighty tells <HI>Joshua</HI> not to fear, saying, Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good Courage, be not affraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee, whithersoever thou goest, <HI>Josh.</HI> 1. 9. So in the Words of our Text, <HI>Rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We might bring in a multitude a Texts to the like purpose: But we shall content our selves with one or two more, out of the New Testament. And the first is that of our Lord and Saviour unto his Disciples then, and to us, even us, now, saying, <HI>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill,</HI> Matth. 10. 28. The same Charge is given to <HI>Paul, Act. 18. 9, 10. Be not afraid, for I am with thee,</HI> &amp;c. Rev. 2. 10. <HI>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer,</HI> &amp;c. I suppose these Texts are a sufficient Testi∣mony to prove, That Courage and Valour in Times of War, when God calls us to fight his Battle, is not only commended, but also required of all his People (and especially of those appointed thereunto, by lawful Authority▪) and a principal means, to keep the Lord of Hosts with, and
<PB N="24" REF="15"/> among such a People. It now remains, that we sum up all, and bring it somewhat nearer unto our selves, in this pusillanimous and Faithless Generation.</P>
<P>What then must we say unto very many in this Age, who are afraid at the very shaking of an Aspen-leaf, and hide themselves at the beat of a Drum, or sound of a Trumpet? Let me ask them, if they think such Pusillanimity is decent, in any one who is called a Man, much more whether it be consentaneous to one that nameth the Name of Christ, to fear and be dismayed, where no fear is: And at the same Time to stand in no awe of the mighty God and terrible, the supreme Governour of Heaven and Earth, who is glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders? Alas, Alas! this cowardise or timidity of Spirit is a grand Shame for any Soldier of Christ, the Captain of our Salvation, to be guilty of; and it commonly hinders those from the punctual Performance of their Duty, who are such fearful Hearts, as we may see in <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> a Ruler of the Jews, who (for fear) durst not openly confess Christ, or come by Day (lest he should be seen of the Jews) to be taught in that heavenly Do∣ctrin of Regeneration, or the new Birth, by him who had the Words of Eternal Life, and spake as never Man speaketh. But on the other Hand, the true fear of God and Christian Courage in the Heart of a Believer, maketh him (in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Phrase) to be as bold as a Lion, and puts him upon any thing, even the most perillous Attempts, in Obedience to Gods Holy Will and Commandments, and in Duty and Allegiance to his Prince: This was it which moved little <HI>David</HI> to encounter with the Giant <HI>Goliath,</HI> the Champion of the <HI>Philistines;</HI> he heard his words, how he defied <HI>Israel,</HI> and saw they were all afraid and dismayed, and therefore he resolves with himself to go and Fight him, and he came to King <HI>Saul,</HI> and said, <HI>Let no Mans Heart fail, because of him; thy Servant will go and Fight with this Phili∣stine,</HI> 1 Sam. 17. 23, 32. Yea, such a Man as serves the Supreme Majesty of Heaven and Earth in sincerity and truth, and is a Soldier of the Holy Jesus in Deed, as well as Profession, will not only be ready to Aid and Assist his Prince with what Mony he can possibly, against an Enemy of Truth and Peace, but, with <HI>David,</HI> he will go himself, and defie that <HI>Philistine</HI> to his Face, who hath defied his God and his King. And so <HI>Paul</HI> himself, an Apostle, or rather chief of the Apostles of Jesus Christ, is not only ready to be Bound, but also to Die at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for the Name of his Master, and the Testimony of a good Conscience: So that we who are, or have been, in the Wars, and have shewed Courage for the Gospel sake, and against the Children of <HI>Babylon,</HI> need not to be cast down at the sharp reflections of some who pretend to be of our Church, but God knoweth their hearts, for they not only are remiss themselves, in stirring up the people to be Couragious in Gods Cause, and be stedfast and faithful unto
<PB N="25" REF="15"/> Their Majesties in these times of War, but they take occasion to upbraid such as do their Duty in this Nature. For my own part, I must speak in the Gospel words, <HI>He that is not with us,</HI> or for us, <HI>is</HI> undoubtedly <HI>against us.</HI> I can easily prove this, for its a palpable Truth, That whosoever grows not daily in Grace, is going backwards from the Region of the Blessed. Go we must, and go we do daily, there is no standing still, because our Glass is running, and our Time flies away as a swift Ship, or as the Eagle that hasteth to the Prey. Either we must walk in the Paths of Righteous∣ness, or else, we must wander in the broad way. So these close sort of People must either follow God or <HI>Baal;</HI> they must, and do, adhere more to Their Majesties, or else their Enemies in their Hearts, for they can ne∣ver be Neuters in real Truth. And therefore he who always praises the <HI>French</HI> Arms, does Tacitly dispraise Their Majesties. He that Justifies the Wicked, and he that Condemns the Just, are equally an Abomination to the Lord, as <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17. 15. And these sort of People are to be avoided. I confess, there are not lacking another sort, who Asperse, and have Aspersed, this Saint-like Valour in the Servants of the most High God, calling it Ignorance, Fool-hardiness, Pride of Heart, and Folly; when as it is indeed, and in truth, nothing else but true Christian Courage, or Fortitude, a Noble stedfastness of Mind and Spirit, which will by no means warp, or swerve, from its Allegiance to our Governors, or be Terrified with any Humane Puissance, or any outward Terribleness, or Amazements: No, nor will it be discouraged at Death it self, or at all the Powers of Darkness. Such was that Courage of <HI>David,</HI> who says, <HI>Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff they Comfort me,</HI> Psal. 23. 4. It was an excellent Answer, that a certain Eminent Servant of God, made unto one of the Emperours, when he was Threaten'd for his Religion, <HI>I fear not Imprisonment, because I can have there as much freedom with my best Friends, as now when I am at liberty. As for Banishment, I defie it, for let me be driven into what terrible Desert or Wilderness whatsoever, yet there shall I find my God. And I look upon this World it self to be a Banishment of us all, for our first Parents Sin and Transgression, Paradise being the true place of our Souls Na∣tivity. And as for Death, I long for it, that I may Triumph over it, through Jesus Christ, (and what am I now but a mere Skeleton, even worn away to Skin and Bones,) and that is the passage unto Eternal Life, and Everlasting Joy.</HI> Oh what can we say to all Pusillanimous Persons, that are afraid to serve the King, or their Country, in the Wars, that dare not trust the Almighty Lord with their Lives in a Camp, or Fleet, as well as here at home, al∣though he is the preserver as well as giver thereof, <HI>For in God we live, in him we move, and in him we have our being,</HI> Acts 17. 28. Sure I am, that Fearfulness, and Pusillanimity, are infallible Specimens and Signals of an
<PB N="26" REF="16"/> Evil and Unbelieving Heart; and the Portion of such, St. <HI>John</HI> says, <HI>is in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimstone.</HI> And it is for want of a well grounded Hope, and a firm Faith in God's Mercy, through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that Men are thus Fearful, which Hope the Children of God have, as an Anchor of their Souls, both sure and stedfast, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 18. And therefore we have a Command for to consider him that endured the Cross, and despised Death, and the shame thereof, for our sakes. And again, look unto that Prince of Glory, who so willingly offered up him∣self to Death, even a Cursed, Ignominious, and Painful Death: And if we have but Faith, as a Grain of Mustard-Seed, we cannot but be Couragi∣ous and Valiant in his Cause, and for his Truth and Gospel-sake. What then so dreadful a Face of present Confusion, or fore-imagined Forms of future Trouble and Calamity, are able, (or ought Slavishly,) to Deject and Terrifie that Holy Soul, which with a sweet and safe Repose is most happily and everlastingly hid under the Wings of that Mighty God whom it ought to trust, and who is the best and safest Defence of all his People? That infinite Majesty of Heaven and Earth, which for the Defence of all such as Fear him, and for their Deliverance is able to work, (1.) By very weak means, as he did in <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Army sometimes, which was no more but Three Hundred against their Enemies the <HI>Midianites</HI> and <HI>Amalekites,</HI> and all the Children of the <HI>East</HI> which were in the Valley, like Grass∣hoppers for Multitude, and their Camels were without Number, as the Sand by the Sea-side, <HI>Judg.</HI> 7. 5, 6, 12. (2.) Without any means at all: Thus did he when he destroyed <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI>'s Enemies the <HI>Moabites</HI> and <HI>Ammonites,</HI> for says the Text, 2 <HI>Chron. 20. 23. The Children of</HI> Ammon <HI>and</HI> Moab, <HI>stood up against the Inhabitants of Mount</HI> Seir, <HI>utterly to slay, and to destroy them: And when they had made an end of the Inhabitants of</HI> Seir, <HI>every one helped to destroy another.</HI> (3.) Contrary to means, As when he <HI>made the Waters, which came down from above, to stand and rise up upon an heap, and those that came down toward the Sea of the Plain, even the Salt Sea, failed, and were cut off,</HI> Josh. 3. 13, 16. So that where the everlasting Jehovah is a Defence and Salvation, there Heaven and Earth, and all the Hosts of both, are Eternally Reconciled to such a Soul, and become its Friends: Yea, all the Storms and Tempests raised by all the powers of Hell are presently Calm'd, for ever doing such a one any Mortal hurt. All the Creatures then pull in their Horns, retire their Stings, bite in their Poison; Snubb'd, and Awed, by those Divine Impressions of their Crea∣tors Blessed Image stamp'd on such a Soul by the Holy Spirit of Grace, and dare not offer any more Trouble or Vexation to it, (except it be up∣on a particular Dispensation for its Spiritual Good and Quickning,) than to the Apple of God's Eye; hear his Holy Promise from his own Mouth, <HI>Hos. 2. 18. And in that Day I will make a Covenant for them,</HI> (namely his
<PB N="27" REF="16"/> Servants,) <HI>with the Beasts of the Field, and with the Fowls of Heaven, and with the Creeping things of the ground: And I will break the Bow, and the Sword, and the Battel, out of the Earth, and I will make them to lie down safely.</HI> For I the Lord their God am their Confidence, and I will keep their Foot from being taken, <HI>For I will set every Man's Sword against his Fellow, in the Camp of my Peoples Enemies, as I did for my Servant</HI> Gideon <HI>and his Army,</HI> Judges 7. 22.</P>
<P>In the last place, This ought to stir us all up, in these times of War, unto this grand Duty of Courage and Boldness, in Fighting the Lords Battel, and depending wholly and solely on him, and Imploring his All∣sufficient Aid, and Almighty Help. Oh let us down with the Mountains, and up with the Valleys, and know no Fears, no Doubtings, no Discou∣ragements; but like <HI>David</HI>'s Worthies, <HI>Which broke through the Host of the</HI> Philistines, <HI>and brought him of the Waters of the Well of</HI> Bethlehem <HI>to drink:</HI> So let us every one make our way through all the Reasonings and Dispu∣tings of Unbelief, into those Everlas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms of God's Free Grace, and Endless Mercy in Jesus Christ. For his Mercy and Assistance towards those that Fear him, and Dread him, is without all stint, and limit, like him∣self, (infinite,) so unmeasurable, that it reaches from everlasting to everlasting. So tender, that it surpasses (incomprehensibly) the Com∣passionate Heart-Meltings of the Lovingest Mother, <HI>Isa. 49. 15, 16. Can a Woman forget her Sucking Child, that she should not have Compassion on the Son of her Womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the Palms of my Hands, thy Walls are continually before me.</HI> Let me tell you then, that it is far more Generous, and Christ-like, for to Die a Martyr in the Cause of God, and for his true Protestant Church, (if we are called thereunto,) than to Live and Moulder away our Time and Strength without doing one tittle of Good in our Genera∣tion. Alas! Within a little while, the Grinders will cease of their own accord, and the Windows of our Eyes will be darken'd, and the Doors, (I mean those Pipes wherewith we draw our Breath) shut up fast: Alas! The Pusillanimous Man, considers not how eagerly, and with what Indu∣stry, the old Sexton, Time, (with his sharp Spade,) throws up the Earth and digs a Grave, where we all, that are now here, must one Day lay our Sins and our Sorrows together, and sow these Mortal Bodies till they rise again in a Glorious, or an intolerable Eternity. Every Revolu∣tion which the Sun makes about the World, divides between Life and Death; so that all those Days which we have lived already are dead to us, and we shall never live them over again, <HI>Currit mortalibus aevum, nec nasci bis posse datur, fugit hora rapitque, Tartareus torrens, ac secum ferre sub umbras, siqua animo placuere negat</HI>—</P>
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>
<P>Poor Mortals! we form our very Words, of that which is most near and dear to us, even the Breath of our Nostrils, and therefore we have the less to live upon, for every word which we speak, hence saith the Prophet <HI>Isaiah, Chap. 2. ult. Cease ye from Man, whose Breath is in his No∣strils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</HI> The Philosophers Taught, That there was no greater Encouragement against all fear of Death, than to consider we must needs Die: There is now an absolute Necessity thereof, or else we cannot obtain Life Eternal, or come to the Glorious God of Life. And this was St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Argument for to prove the Resurrection, <HI>That which thou sowest is not quicken'd except it die.</HI> So these Natural Bodies must be dissolved into Dust and Corruption, before they can be made Spi∣ritual, and like unto Christ's Glorious Body. Oh remember then, that the very Heathens Taught, <HI>That it was no small Honour to Die for ones Coun∣try.</HI> But we Christians must confess, that 'tis the highest Honour to Die for the Faith of Christ, and a good Conscience towards God. And there∣fore let me bespeak you all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in Their Majesties Fleet and Army, in the words of <HI>Joab, 2 Sam. 10. 12. Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men,</HI> for our King and Queen, <HI>for our People,</HI> and for our Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Lord do that which seemeth good. Fear not, nor be afraid, but Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your Fear, and let him be your Dread, and he shall be a Sanctuary to you. But for a Gin, and a Snare, and a Trap, to the Adversaries of his Truth. Would you have the Crown of Life? Oh be you Valiant and Faithful unto Death! Would you have the Great and Terrible God among you as your Strength and Defence? Oh then let not Vain Thoughts Lodg in your Breast! <HI>But cease to do Evil, and learn to do well.</HI> Would you be esteem'd Worthies by God, and Their Majesties? then break through the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Army, and sink their Idolatrous and Superstitious Fopperies into the bot∣tom of the Sea. Would you have your Memories Blessed, and your Names to be had in Everlasting Remembrance, and the Generations to come for to Praise your Glorious and Noble Deeds? Then, be sure, for to pull down some Monuments of Idolatry, and Raze out some Relicts of Popery, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake; and with <HI>Sampson</HI> Aveng your selves of your Enemies at once, <HI>before you go hence, and be no more seen▪ Rebel not ye against the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Amen, Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
