<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Hollander having made several bold At∣tempts, even up to our very Cinque-Ports of Dover and Sandwich, his Excellency General Blake called a Councel of Officers, who with great alacrity, unanimously resolved to give a check to their insolency; in pursuance whereof, the whole fleet weighed anchor, who after few hours sailing, came within sight of the Dutch Navy on Tuesday last; and bea∣ring up to them, the enemy prepared to receive 'em, which the General perceiving, made all the possible hast he could to action, so that immediatly began a great dispute, which continued for the space of four hours; and with great va∣lour and courage, on both sides, was the conflict maintain∣ed;
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> the Onset was extreme hot and violent; and with great fury did we salute each other; the General conceiv∣ing that this might possibly be his last before he sealed all his faithful services with his precious bloud, charged twice through the enemies fleet with the Royal Soveraign, and the Resolution, receiving many a great Volley from them, which did exceedingly rent and tear his Sails and Tack∣ling, especially the Resolution; yet blessed be God in his own ship he lost not above three men, onely some few wounded.</P>
<P>Captain Bodilo performed singular service, and was in∣gaged even in the very thickest of action, being surround∣ed by six stout Men of War; he received many dangerous shot, had divers wounded, and about 20 slain; but at last, by the assistance of the Speaker, the Greyhound, and Dia∣mond, she got safe off, but being disabled for the present, was forced to strike into Yarmouth, to be new cork'd and rigg'd up. Two Merchants that were likewise in the ser∣vice having received several shot under water, and being neer sinking, were forced to make to the shore. Many of our ships are much rent and torn, being most of them ex∣tremely engaged; but what our loss of men at present is we know not, yet thus much I may ingenuously infer, that in so sharp a Conflict, disputed with so great gallan∣try and resolution on both sides, but some loss must needs be sustain'd: However, confident I am, that the enemies is far greater, for we have sunk their Rear-Admirall, a gallant ship carrying about fifty Guns, and their great ship that carryed 68 Guns, being the greatest that was ever yet set forth by their high and mighty States, and the first time that ever she engaged in service; Our men boarded her twice, but was both times repelled; and the third time be∣came masters; yet not long they could enjoy her, for even
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> in a moment of time, they were forced to desert her, by reason she had received many shots betwixt Wind &amp; Wa∣ter, which caused her suddenly to sink, yet 6 of our men perished in her, time not permitting them liberty to e∣scape forth.</P>
<P>We sunk also another of their Men of War; and took their Vice Admiral, and two more lusty ships. After which, bearing up close to them, with a Resolution to hail and boord, the enemy began to decline engagement; but our General gave Order to embrace the pursuit, in obedience whereunto, we chased them all day of Wednesday, and part of Thursday, till we came within sight of their own shore; during which time, the fight was extreme hot, and great was the execution; but what further loss the ene∣my sustained, we know not, yet certainly it must needes be very great; for from Tuesday in the morning till Thursday in the evening, the noise of the Canon was continually heard, and in our pursuit we ply'd them close with round shot; though notwithstanding Admiral De-witte and De-Ruttyer resolutely returned us many a thundering Vol∣ley; and indeed, to deal plainly, the major part of them fought very gallantly; notwithstanding which, it pleased Divine Providence to crown us with Victory, and so to dissipate their great Armado, that many of them are forced to betake themselves to Harbour. We are now making up to the Downs, with the whole fleet, and the Generall intends to send out Scouts, to observe the motion of the enemy; touching which, I doubt not but to give you am∣ple satisfaction very suddenly; in the interim, I shall onely present you with a general List of what hath already hap∣ned; as more evidently apppears by the inclosed.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from the Streights, touching a∣nother bloudy fight between the English and Dutch neer Leghorn, continuing for the space of 3 dayes.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAptain Bodilaw, Commander of the Paragon, one of the States ships, with the Phoenix Frigat, and two o∣ther
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> men of war coming from the Levant; and having with him 4 good Merchant ships, being come down neer to Lei∣ghorn, the Dutch who do still keep our ships blocked up in that port, resolved to go out to fight our ships, &amp; there∣fore made choice of ten of their best men of war, who went out leaving still 6 behind them to keep ours in the Har∣bor: The fight continued neer 3 dayes, and the Dutch ha∣ving spont much valour to become masters of our men of war, four of the Dutch best ships surrounded Capt. Bodi∣law, as being the best ship and Admiral of the Squadron, fought him very stoutly above 4 hours; but after they were forced to fall off and leave her, yet not without great loss, and likewise on our side many killed and wounded: During which time, the other ships were in a hot dispute, and the Captain of the Phoenix attempted to boord one of the Dutch ships who had lost her Mast, and after some dispute became master of her, but the gaeediness of plun∣der having made our men too negligent of their own Fri∣got, and another Dutchman coming up on the other side, and finding her void of men, soon became masters of the Phoenix, and regained their own, took our Capiain and his men prisoners and by reason of the neer approach of the night carryed them safe away; our ships are gone to Por∣tolongone, and the Dutch returned to joyn with those they left at Leghorn.</P>
