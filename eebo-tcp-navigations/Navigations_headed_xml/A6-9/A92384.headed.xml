<HEAD>A Relation of the whole proceedings concerning the redemption of the Captives in ARGEIR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S nothing can demonstrate to the world the sincerity of the intenti∣ons of a State better then their own publick actions: so the pie∣ty of their resolutions can never be manifested more clearly, then when carried on through va∣riety of difficulties: the truth whereof doth herein most evidently appear. At the commence of this Parliament, while yet the kingdom was in peace, both Houses passed an Act, where∣by they did manifest unto the world their resolutions of undertaking that Christian work of the redemption of the Captives taken by Tur∣kish, Moorish, and other Pirats, from that cruel thraldome which they lay under: immediately after the passing whereof, this unnaturall war was by the malice of the Kingdomes enemies formented and continued, and the whole King∣dome
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>enwrapped in misery, and to be redeem∣ed by both Houses of Parliament, from the ty∣rannicall oppression which it groaned under. Whereby indeed that work of the redemption of the Captives was for a time interrupted in its progression: and had the Parliament looked on thing only according to humane reason they might well have altogether deferred the under∣taking at that time that so great an action, refer∣ring to a forein State, so remote as Africa: yet with a proportionall equality of care to release the whole, and its severall part, those principles that first moved them, kept up their resolutions in the midst of the storme, yea quickned them on: To that purpose in the year 1645 they set forth a ship of strength called the <HI>Honour,</HI> laden with a Gargasoon of money and goods, to a great va∣lue: sending <HI>Edmond Cason</HI> Esq. their Agent, with Power and instructions to go for Argier, to treat for the release of the English Captives from thence, and setling of a future peace, for security of the Marchants and Mariners voyage. But it so pleased the Divine Providence (to whose guidance all things submit) that the said ship) with her lading, comming to anchor, (by rea∣son of contrary windes,) in the Road of Gibral∣tar,
<PB N="7" REF="3"/>was there by accident set on fire, all possi∣ble means used to quench it, but with no effect, the goods by violence of the inhabitants of the place taken away, and not by the Agent to be recovered: some monies that were saved were put on board another English ship called the <HI>Diamond,</HI> at that time riding in the Bay but the <HI>Diamond</HI> a while after, before her return to England, was cast away near <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and so the monies there were lost. Thus one affliction is added to another, and misery, like waves, tread one on the others heel: And now who could have otherwise thought, but that with this sad disaster, the work it self would have been layd aside: but yet that great God that gave the first motion, continued the resolutions. And on consi∣dence of a good effect in the end this last year, 1646. Both Houses were pleased againe to set forth a ship of strength, called the <HI>Charles,</HI> with a Gargasoon of money and goods: sending the said <HI>Edmond Cason</HI> Esq. again their Agent with the like power and commission at before, for to treat for redemption of the Captives, and set∣ling of a firme peace. In prosecution of which orders, the said Agent, ship, and goods, procee∣ded on the voyage, and God hath so blessed the
<PB N="8" REF="4"/>work that they arived at that Port in safety: where after a long and difficult treaty, the Re∣gister of the Captives is taken, wherein are in∣rolled the names of all that are upon that place, and the price for their ransome agreed on, as they first cost in the market: that Gargasoon of money and goods that was sent out, hath by the Agent been so well managed, as that 244 persons, men, women &amp; children, are redeem∣ed and sent home in the said ship, the <HI>Charles:</HI> the Agent is constrained to stay there, untill such time as the remainder are likewise redeemed. In preparation to the dispatch wherof, two ships are now providing to be sent thither with a greater Gargasoon then before: and to the in∣tent that all may receive satisfaction concerning the proceedings of the treaty, the number of the persons there captives, the names of the persons redeemed and brought home. The course taken for, those at Tunnis, here followeth, the extract of the Letters of the Agent Mr. <HI>Cason,</HI> the List of the persons redeemed, and the translation in Eng∣lish of the Letters from the Basha, the Duana, the Mufty, Caddee and Shoudes, unto both Houses of Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>An Extract out of the Letters of EDMOND CASON Esq; the Par∣liaments Agent at Argier, directed unto the Committee of the Navy, dated the 29 of October, 1646.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Ay it please you, we arived at this Port in safety, thanks be to GOD, the 21 of September; the Basha and Duana sent me a safe conduct the next day: I went on shoar, and deli∣vered my Letters to the Basha, who had order from the Duana to treat with me, and desired to know my businesse so I delivered him, and some of the Duana my credentiall Letters, and then advised them my commands from the Par∣liament, both for complaints, and the joyning perpetuall peace, and desired the subjects of Eng∣land to be delivered unto me free, for wee had
<PB N="10" REF="5"/>not broke the peace with them: they answered they consented a peace, but the Slaves were sold unto divers men, souldiers, and others, who would not deliver them without paying for them what they first cost in the market, as should appear by their books. Being not content with this answer, I desired my Letters (being then translated) to be read in the Duana, to have the answer from the Basha and Duana when they were in councell, the which they consented: the next Saturday (being the day of their sitting) the 26 <HI>Ditto,</HI> I had the same answer by the Trudgeman; and for all things I was againe ap∣pointed to treat with the Basha, this day the peace was concluded and proclaimed in the Duana.</P>
<P>The Basha entertained me with all courtesie, feasted me at his house, and afterwards in the fields.</P>
<P>Then I desired to take a register of all the English there detained as Captives; and that e∣very owner of an English captive might come with his slave before me, and a Scrivener of this place to declare his slaves name, and what he cost him the first penny, the which was re∣gistred by us both; and further took the place he
<PB N="11" REF="5"/>was of, his age, and what ship he was taken in, and how many years past. I was informed that divers Turks and Moores caused us to set down much more then their slaves cost, the which I did advise the Basha; he swore by the head of his master, the great Turk, I should pay not an Asper more then they cost in the market, at the first sale when they were brought on shoar. The register being taken of those which be here, there are 650 and upwards, besides above an too in the ships of this place, now at Candia in the service of the great Turk. And after payment of the 10000 dollors, bagreed to give him six <HI>per cent.</HI> for what money I should import to pay the ran∣some of slaves, otherwise must have paid ten <HI>per cent.</HI> Then also we agreed for his duties for ex∣portation of the slaves 20 Pesas <HI>per</HI> man to the Basha, and to the Officers half duties; all which comes unto 31½ Dollars <HI>per</HI> slave, without agree∣ment they would have cost about 50 Dollars a man for charges.</P>
<P>Divers of the English Youths bee turned Turks, through beating and hard usage; and di∣vers children, the which they keep very gallant, but the young men (after turned) they carry to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and other parts to the Eastwards.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="6"/>
<P>Now for the freeing of the Captives, my de∣sire is, that it may be done with all brevity, and with ready money, whilest this Basha is here. The greatest part of the inhabitants had rather keep their slaves then permit them to be freed: they come to much more <HI>per</HI> head then I expe∣cted, the reason is, here be many women and children which cost 50 l. <HI>per</HI> head first penny, and might sell them for an 100. Besides them there are divers which were Masters of ships and Carpenters, Caulkers, Coopers, Sailemakers, Chirurgions, and others which are here highly esteemed; so that they doe come unto 32 l. <HI>per</HI> man first penny, as they have rated them one with another, and the port charges is 6 l: 6 s. <HI>per</HI> head, so they will be about 38 l. <HI>per</HI> head put a ship board. I desired to have agreed with them at a certain price one with another, old &amp; yong; That they would not consent unto, aleaging, that they were bought at severall prices, and it would make trouble amongst them: the King hath promised I shall not be wronged.</P>
<P>I have all things under their hands and seals; the originall peace according to the ancient capitulations renewed under the hand of the Basha, Duana, as also under the hand and seal
<PB N="13" REF="6"/>of the Musty and Caddee, and Shoudes, which be principall Justices of the peace.</P>

<HEAD>Extract out of the Letters of the said <HI>Edmond Cason,</HI> dated the 26 of November, 1646.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please you,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last was 29 October: They of this place doe expect that our ships should not defend any other Nation which shal bee in our Company from the ships of this place. I thought to have taken away the bet∣ter sort of the people first, and the rest afterwards, the which I understood to be the command gi∣ven me: but it pleased God so to order, that I must take away those I could have for cloth, and leave the rest till afterwards. The Basha pleased to tell me, when we had difference, that seeing I had taken the Register of the English, and their price, I should clear them before I went hence.</P>
<P>For the money set down, I perswade my self you shall have your people free; for both Spani∣ards and French have their protections perfor∣med, when they come to clear slaves from this place:</P>
<PB N="14" REF="7"/>
<P>For the businesse to be acted at Tunnis, I must send your Letters to the Consull and the Mer∣chants there to effect the appointed Now they strive who shall have their slaves first taken off: and when soever your Honours please to send money, which in my opinion, the sooner the better; though you suffer some inconveniences at home, it will give a great reputation to their better performance of the peace, which is hi∣therto only concluded as formerly, not having the last Articles yet translated, the which I will follow. I beseech your Honors not to think that this redemption may be part one year, and part another: and I desire your people may go home in Summer, for I do assure you, their clothes be thin. I think two good ships and a Pinnace, will be fit to fetch away the rest of the slaves.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="8"/>Christians that were slaves to be delivered unto him; which could not bee granted, because they were bought by Turks and souldiers that were in the pay, and they would not deliver them till they had the mo∣ney they cost them at first in the market; and if he will take them upon those conditions, as they had upon the former peace, we will have a good peace with them: as they have in Constantinople with the Grand Signior, up∣on this good peace concluded, we, both small and great, in the Duana, were upon those agreements well content for the slaves as they have been sold first in the market, so they shall have them upon that price againe, as shall ap∣pear by their books at the time of their sale.</P>
