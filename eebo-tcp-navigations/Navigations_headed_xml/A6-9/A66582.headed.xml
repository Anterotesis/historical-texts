<P>FInding by my Conversation with People who have an Inclination to try their <HI>Fortunes</HI> in <HI>A∣merica,</HI> that your <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Carolina</HI> had not its due valuation for want of being made known to the World, and not hearing of any that had underta∣ken it, I looked upon it as a Duty incumbent upon me, who have had the Honour to be your <HI>Secretary</HI> in your <HI>Carolina</HI>-Affairs now four years, to Publish the en∣suing <HI>Treatise;</HI> whereby is made known the Great∣ness of your <HI>Soveraigns</HI> Gift to your Selves, and to the World the Greatness of your Trust and Favour with Him; and to those that have a desire of settling there, to what kind of <HI>Countrey</HI> and <HI>Climate</HI> they Transport Themselves: Wherein I have most strictly kept to the Rules of Truth, there not being any thing that I have written in Commendation of your <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI> which I cannot prove by Letters from thence now in my possession, and by Living Witnesses now in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Province OF CAROLINA IN AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAROLINA,</HI> is that part of <HI>Florida,</HI> which lies between <HI>twenty nine</HI> and <HI>thirty six De∣grees,</HI> and <HI>thirty Minutes</HI> of <HI>Northern La∣titude:</HI> On the <HI>East</HI> it is washed with the <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> and is bounded on the <HI>West</HI> by <HI>Mare Pacificum</HI> (or the South Sea) and within these bounds is contained the most healthy Fertile and pleasant part of <HI>Florida,</HI> which is so much commen∣ded by the Spanish Authors.</P>
<P>This <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Carolina,</HI> was in the Year 1663. Granted by <HI>Letters Pattents</HI> in Propriety of his most Gracious <HI>Majesty,</HI> unto the Right Honourable <HI>Ed∣ward
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>Earl of Clarendon, George</HI> Duke of <HI>Albemarle, William</HI> Earl of <HI>Craven, John</HI> Lord <HI>Berkely, Antho∣ny</HI> Lord <HI>Ashly,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colleton,</HI> Knights and Barro∣nets, Sir <HI>William Berkeley</HI> Knight, by which Letters Pattents the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are to be of force in <HI>Carolina:</HI> but the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have power with the consent of the Inhabitants to make By-Laws for the better Government of the said <HI>Province:</HI> So that no Money can be raised or Law made, without the consent of the Inhabitants or their Representa∣tives. They have also power to appoint and im∣power Governours, and other Magistrates to Grant Liberty of Conscience, make Constitutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> With many other great Priviledges, as by the said Letters Pattents will more largely appear. And the said Lords Proprietors have there setled a Constitu∣tion of Government, whereby is granted Liberty of Conscience, and wherein all possible care is taken for the equal Administration of Justice, and for the lasting Security of the Inhabitants both in their Per∣sons and Estates.</P>
<P>By the care and endeavours of the said Lords Pro∣prietors, and at their very great charge, two Colonys have been setled in this <HI>Province,</HI> the one at <HI>Albe∣marle</HI> in the most Northerly part, the other at <HI>Ashly</HI> River, which is in the Latitude of thirty two De∣grees odd Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Albemarle</HI> bordering upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> and only ex∣ceeding it in Health, Fertility, and Mildness of the Winter, is in the Growths, Productions, and other things much of the same nature with it: Wherefore I shall not trouble the Reader with a perticular De∣scription of that part; but apply my self principally
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>to discourse of the Collony at <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> which being many Degrees more Southward than <HI>Virginia,</HI> differs much from it in the Nature of its Clymate and Productions.</P>
<P><HI>Ashly-River</HI> was first setled in <HI>April</HI> 1670, the Lords Proprietors having at their sole charge, set out three Vessels, with a considerable number of able Men; eighteen Moneths Victuals, with Cloths, Tools, Ammunition, and what else was thought necessary for a new Settlement, and continued at this charge to supply the Collony for divers years after, until the Inhabitants were able by their own Industry to live of themselves; in which condition they have been for divers years past, and are arrived to a very great Degree of Plenty of all sorts of Provisions. Insomuch, that most sorts are already cheaper there, than in any other of the English Collonys, and they are plentifully enough supplied with all things from <HI>England</HI> or other Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Ashly-River,</HI> about seven Miles in from the Sea, di∣vides it self into two Branches; the Southermost re∣taining the name of <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> the North Branch is called <HI>Cooper-River.</HI> In <HI>May,</HI> 1680. the Lords Pro∣prietors sent their Orders to the Government there, appointing the Port-Town for these two Rivers to be Built on the Poynt of Land that divides them, and to be called <HI>Charles</HI> Town, since which time about an hundred Houses are there Built, and more are Building daily by the Persons of all sorts that come there to Inhabit, from the more Northern English Collonys, and the Sugar Islands, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> and many Persons who went to <HI>Carolina</HI> Ser∣vants, being Industrious since they came out of their times with their Masters, at whose charge they were
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>Transported, have gotten good Stocks of Cattle, and Servants of their own; have here also Built Houses, and exercise their Trades: And many that went thi∣ther in that condition, are now worth several Hun∣dreds of Pounds, and live in a very plentiful condi∣tion, and their Estates still encreasing. And Land is become of that value near the Town, that it is sold for twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Acre, though pillaged of all its valuable Timber, and not cleared of the rest, and Land that is clear'd and fitted for Planting, and Fenced, is let for ten Shillings <HI>per annum</HI> the Acre, though twenty miles distant from the Town, and six men will in six weeks time, Fall, Clear, Fence in, and fit for Planting, six Acres of Land.</P>
<P>At this Town, in <HI>November,</HI> 1680. There Rode at one time sixteen Sail of Vessels (some of which were upwards of 200 Tuns) that came from divers parts of the Kings Dominions to trade there, which great concourse of shipping, will undoubtebly in a short time make it a considerable Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eastern Shore of America,</HI> whether it be by reason of its having the great Body of the Conti∣nent to the Westward of it, and by consequence the Northwest-Wind (which Flows contrary to the Sun) the Freezing-Wind, as the North-East is in <HI>Europe,</HI> or that the Frozen Lakes which Lye-in, be∣yond <HI>Canada,</HI> and lye <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West</HI> from the Shore, Impregnate the Freezing Wind with more chill and congealing qnalities, or that the uncultivated Earth, covered for the most part with large shading Trees, breathes forth more nitrous Vapours, than that which is cultivated; or all these Reasons together, it is certainly much more cold than any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the same Degree of Latitude of thirty nine and forty,
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>and more <HI>North,</HI> though above six hundred Miles nearer the Sun than <HI>England;</HI> is notwithstanding, many Degrees colder in the Winter.</P>
<P>The Author having been informed by those that say they have seen it, that in those Parts it Freezeth above six Inches thick in a Night, and great Navi∣gable Rivers are Frozen over in the same space of time; and the Country about <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> though within nine Degrees of the <HI>Tropick,</HI> hath seldom any Winter that doth not produce some Ice, though I cannot yet learn that any hath been seen on Rivers or Ponds, above a quarter of an Inch thick, which vanisheth as soon as the Sun is an hour or two high, and when the Wind is not at <HI>North-west,</HI> the wea∣ther is very mild. So that the <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> of <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> I suppose to be of the same Tempe∣rature with the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> and beginning of <HI>April</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> this small Winter causeth a fall of the Leaf, and adapts the Country to the pro∣duction of all the Grains and Fruits of <HI>England,</HI> as well as those that require more Sun; insomuch, that at <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> the Apple, the Pear, the Plum, the Quince, Apricock, Peach, Medlar, Walnut, Mulber∣ry, and Chesnut, thrive very well in the same Gar∣den, together with the Orange, the Lemon, the O∣live, the Pomgranate, the Fig and Almond; nor is the Winter here Cloudy, Overcast, or Foggy, but it hath been observed that from the twentieth of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> to the tenth of <HI>March,</HI> including all the Winter Months, there have been but eight overcast days, and though Rains fall pretty often in the Winter, it is most commonly in quick Showers, which when past, the Sun shines out clear again.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<P>The Summer is not near so hot as in <HI>Virginia,</HI> or the other Northern American English Collonys, which may hardly gain belief with those that have not considered the reason; which is its neerness to the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> which makes it in a greater measure than those parts more Northward partake of those Breezes, which almost constantly rise about eight or nine of the Clock, within the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> and blow fresh from the <HI>East</HI> till about four in the Afternoon; and a little after the Sea-breeze dys away, there ri∣fes a North-wind, which blowing all night, keeps it fresh and cool. In short, I take <HI>Carolina</HI> to be much of the same nature with those delicious Countries about <HI>Aleppo, Antioch,</HI> and <HI>Smyrna:</HI> but hath the ad∣vantage of being under an equal English Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>Such, who in this Country have seated themselves near great Marshes, are subject to Agues, as those are who are so seated in <HI>England:</HI> but such who are planted more remote from Marshes or standing Wa∣ters, are exceeding healthy; insomuch, that out of a Family consisting of never less than twelve Per∣ons, not one hath died since their first Arrival there, which is nine years: but what is more, not one hath been sick in all that time; nor is there one of the Masters of Families that went over in the first Ves∣sels, dead of sickness in <HI>Carolina,</HI> except one, who was seventy and five years of Age before he came there; though the number of those Masters of Fa∣milies be pretty considerable: divers persons that went out of <HI>England</HI> Ptisical, and Consumptive, have recover'd, and others subject in <HI>England</HI> to frequent fits of the Stone, have been absolutely freed from them after they have been there a short time; nor is
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>the Gout there yet known. The Ayr gives a strony Appetite and quick Digestion, nor is it witetlh suitable effects, men finding themselves apparntly more lightsome, more prone, and more able to al Youthful Exercises, than in <HI>England,</HI> the Women are very Fruitful, and the Children have fresh San∣guine Complexions.</P>
<P>The Soyle is generally very fertile, but hath some sandy tracts so as to make an agreable variety, but even this Land produceth good Corne and is excellent pasture; Wheat, <HI>Rye, Barly, Oates,</HI> and Peas, thrive exceedingly, and the ground yeilds in greater abun∣dance than in <HI>England, Turnips, Parsnips, Carrots, Potatoes,</HI> and <HI>Edoes,</HI> a substantial wholesome nourishing Root growes well, and all excellent in their kindes they have near twenty sorts of Pulse that we have not in <HI>England,</HI> all of them very good food, insomuch that the <HI>English</HI> Garden Bean is not regarded.</P>
<P>Near the Sea the Trees are not very large, they grow pritty neare together; farther up they are larger, and grow farther asunder, and are in most parts free from Underwood, so that you may see near half a mile amongst the bodyes of large tall timber trees, whose tops meeting make a very pleasing shade, yet hinders not grass, myrtle and other sweet scenting shrubs here and there from growing under them: Amongst these Groves of Timber Trees are here and there Savana's, (or grassy plains) of severall magni∣tudes clear of Trees, which hath occasion'd some that have seene them to compare <HI>Carolina</HI> to those pleasant Parks in <HI>England,</HI> that have abundance of tall Timber Trees unlop'd, here you may hunt the Hare, Fox, and Deere all day long in the shade, and freely
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>spur your horse through the <HI>Woods</HI> to follow the chase.</P>
<P>This Country hath the Oak, Ash, Elm, Poplar, Beech, and all the other sorts of usefull Timber that <HI>England</HI> hath, and divers sorts of lasting Timber that <HI>England</HI> hath not, as Cedar white and red, Cypress, Locust, Bay and Laurell Trees, equal to the biggest Oaks, large Mirtles, Hickery, black Wallnut, and Pynes big enough to Mast the greatest Ships, and divers other sorts, which I cannot enumerate.</P>
<P>The woods abound with <HI>Hares, Squirrels, Ratoons Possums, Conyes</HI> and <HI>Deere,</HI> which last are so plenty that an Indian hunter hath kill'd nine fatt Deere in a day all shott by himself, and all the considerable Planters have an Indian hunter which they hire for jess than twenty shillings a year, and one hunter will very well find a Family of thirty people with as much Venison and Foul, as they can well eat. Here are also in the woods great plenty of wilde <HI>Turkeys, Partridges,</HI> something smaller than those of <HI>England,</HI> but more deicate, <HI>Turtle Doves, Paraquetos,</HI> and <HI>Pidgeons:</HI> On the grassy plaines the whistling <HI>Plover</HI> and <HI>Cranes</HI> and divers sorts of Birds unknowne in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Carolina</HI> doth so abound in Rivers, that within fifty miles of the Sea you can hardly place your self seven miles from a Navigable River, and divers are naviga∣ble for good big Vessels above three hundred miles: The Rivers abound with variety of excellent Fish, and near the Sea with very good Oysters, in many of which are Pearl: the Author having seen Pearl that have been taken out of some of them bigger than Rouncival Pease, and perfectly round. On the Rivers and brooks are all the winter moneths vast quantitys of <HI>Swan, wild Geese, Duck, Widgeon, Teale, Curlew, Snype, Shell Drake,</HI> and a certaine sort <HI>of black
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>Duck</HI> that is excellent meat, and stayes there all the year.</P>
<P>Neat Cattle thrive and increase here exceedingly, there being perticular Planters that have already se∣ven or eight hundred head, and will in a few years in all probability, have as many thousands, unless they sell some part; the Cattle are not subject to any Disease as yet perceiv'd, and are fat all the Year long without any Fother, the little Winter they have, not pinching them so as to be perceiv'd, which is a great advantage the Planters here have of the more Northern Plantations who are all forc'd to give their Cattle Fother, and must spend a great part of their Summers Labour in providing three or four Months Fother for their Cattle in the Winter, or else would have few of them alive in the Spring, which will keep them from ever having very great Heards, or be able to do much in Planting any Co∣modity for Forreign Markets; the providing Win∣ter Food for their Cattle, taking up so much of their Summers Labour; So that many Judicious Persons think that <HI>Carolina</HI> will be able by Sea, to supply those Northern Collonys, with salted Beef for their Shipping, cheaper than they themselves with what is bred amongst them; for, considering that all the Woods in <HI>Carolina</HI> afford good Pasturage, and the small <HI>Rent</HI> that is paid to the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> for Land, an Ox is raised at almost as little expence in <HI>Carolina,</HI> as a Hen is in <HI>England.</HI> And it hath by experience been found that Beef will take salt at <HI>Ashly-River</HI> any Month in the Year, and save very well.</P>
<P>Ewes have most commonly two or three Lambs at a time; their Wool is a good Staple, and they thrive
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>very well, but require a Shepherd to drive them to Feed, and to bring them home at night to preserve them from the Wolves.</P>
<P>Hogs increase in <HI>Carolina</HI> abundantly, and in a man∣ner without any charge or trouble to the Planter, only to make them Sheds, wherein they may be pro∣tected from the Sun and Rain, and Morning and E∣vening to give them a little Indian Corn, or the pickings and parings of <HI>Potatoes, Turnips,</HI> or other Roots, and at the same time blowing a Horn, or ma∣king any other constant noyse, to which being us'd, they will afterwards upon hearing it, repair home, the rest of their Food they get in the Woods, of Masts, and Nuts of several sorts; and when those fail, they have Grass and Roots enough, the ground being never frozen so hard as to keep them from Rooting, these conveniencies breeds them large, and in the Mast time they are very fat, all which makes the rearing them so easy, that there are ma∣ny Planters that are single and have never a Servant, that have two or three hundred Hogs, of which they make great profit; <HI>Barbados, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> affording a constant good price for their Pork; by which means they get wherewithal to build them more convenient Houses, and to purchase Servants, and <HI>Negro-slaves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There have</HI> been imported into <HI>Carolina,</HI> about an hundred and fifty Mares, and some Horses from <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Road-Island,</HI> which breeds well, and the Coalts they have are finer Lim'd and Headed than their Dams or Sires, which gives great hopes of an excellent breed of Horses, as soon as they have gotten good Stalions amongst them.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
<P><HI>Negros,</HI> By reason of the mildness of the Winter thrive and stand much better, than in any of the more Northern Collonys, &amp; require less clothes, which is a great charge sav'd.</P>
<P>With the Indians the <HI>English</HI> have a perfect freind∣ship, they being both usefull to one another. And care is taken by the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> that no Injustice shall be done them; In order to which they have established a particular Court of Judicature, (com∣pos'd of the soberest and most disinteressed Inhabi∣tants) to determine all differnces that shall happen between the <HI>English</HI> and any of the <HI>Indians,</HI> this they do upon a Christian and Moral Consideration, and not out of any apprehension of danger from them, for the <HI>Indians</HI> have been always so ingaged in Wars one Town or Village against another (their Govern∣ment being usually of no greater extent) that they have not suffered any increase of People, there having been several Nations in a manner quite extirpated by Wars amongst themselves since the <HI>English</HI> setled at <HI>Ashly</HI> River: This keeps them so thin of people, and so divided, that the <HI>English</HI> have not the least ap∣prehensions of danger from them; the <HI>English</HI> being already too strong for all the <HI>Indians</HI> within five hun∣dred Miles of them, if they were united, and this the <HI>Indians</HI> as well know, that they will never dare to break with the <HI>English,</HI> or do an Injury to any par∣ticular person, for fear of having it reveng'd upon their whole Nation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> do at present grant to all persons that come there to Inhabit as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> To each Master or Mistriss of a Family fifty acres, and for every able son or man servant they shall carry or cause to be transported into <HI>Carolina</HI> fifty acres more, and the like for each Daughter or woman servant that
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>is marrigeable, and for each child, man or woman ser∣vant under sixteen years of age, forty acres, and fifty acres of Land to each servant when out of their time, this Land to be injoy'd by them and their Heirs for ever, they paying a Penny an Acre Quit-rent to the Lords Proprietors, the Rent to commence in two years after their taking up their Land. But forasmuch as divers persons who are already Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and others that have Intentions to transport them∣selves into that <HI>Province,</HI> desire not to be cumber'd with paying of a Rent, and also to secure to them∣selves good large convenient tracts of Land, without being forc'd to bring thither a great number of ser∣vants at one time; The <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have been Prevail'd upon, and have agreed to sell to those who have a mind to buy Land, after the rate of fifty pound for a Thousand Acres, reserving a Pepper-Corn <HI>per annum</HI> Rent when demanded.</P>
<P>The way of any ones taking up his Land, due to him either by carrying himself or servants into the Country, or by purchasing it of the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> is after this manner: He first seeks out a place to his mind that is not already possessed by any other, then applyes himself to the Governour and Proprietors Deputys, and shew what rights he hath to Land, either by Purchase or otherwise; who thereupon issue out their Warrant to the Surveyor-General to measure him out a Plantation containing the number of acres due to him; who making Certificate that he hath measur'd out so much Land and the Bounds, a Deed is prepar'd of course, which is signed by the Gover∣nour and the Lords Proprietors Deputys, and the <HI>Proprietors</HI> Seal affixed to it and Register'd, which is is a good Conveyance in Law of the Land therein mention'd to the party and his Heirs for ever.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>
<P>I have here, as I take it, described a pleasant &amp; fertile Country, abounding in health and pleasure, and with all things necessary for the sustenance of mankind, and wherein I think I have written nothing but truth, sure I am I have inserted no wilful falshood: I have also told you how men are to have Land that go there to Inhabit. But a rational man will certainly inquire, When I have Land, what shall I doe with it? what Co∣moditys shall I be able to produce that will yeild me mony in other Countrys, that I may be inabled to buy <HI>Negro</HI> slaves (without which a Planter can ne∣ver do any great matter) and purchase other things for my pleasure and convenience, that <HI>Carolina</HI> doth not produce? To this I answer, That besides the great profit that will be made by the vast heards of Cat∣tle and Swine, the Country appears to be proper for the Commoditys following. <HI>viz.</HI></P>

There are growing</HI> naturally in the Country five sorts of Grapes, three of which the French Vig∣naroons who are there, judge will make very good Wine, and some of the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have taken care to send plants of the <HI>Rhenish, Canary, Clarret, Muscatt, Madera,</HI> and Spanish <HI>Grapes,</HI> of all which divers Vinyards are planted; some wine was made this year that proved very good both in colour and taste, and an indifferent good quantity may be ex∣pected the next year: The Country hath gentle rising hills of fertile sand proper for Vines, and farther from the Sea, rock and gravel, on which very good grapes grow naturally, ripen well, and together, and very lushious in taste, insomuch as the French Pro∣testants who are there, and skill'd in wine, do no way doubt of producing great quantitys and very good.</P>
<P><HI>Oyl. There are</HI> severall <HI>Olive</HI> trees growing, which were carryed thither, some from <HI>Portugal,</HI> and some from <HI>Bermeudas</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>and flourish excedingly, and the Inhabitants take great care to propagate more, so that in all probability it will be an excellent Oyl-Country.</P>
<P><HI>Silk.</HI> There is in <HI>Carolina</HI> great plenty of <HI>Mulberry</HI> Trees, such as are by experience found to feed the Silk∣worm very well, yea as well as the white Mulberry, but there is of that sort also, which are propagated with a great deal of ease, a stick new cut and thrust into the ground, seldom failing to grow, and so like∣wise if the Seed if them be sown.</P>
<P><HI>Tobacco. Tobacco</HI> doth here grow very well, and is nearer to the nature of the <HI>Spanish Tobacco</HI> than that of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indigo. Indigo</HI> thrives well here, and very good hath been made.</P>
<P><HI>Cotton. Cotton</HI> of the <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI> sort will grow well, and good plenty of the Seed is sent thither.</P>
<P><HI>Flax &amp; Hemp</HI> Thrives exceedingly.</P>
<P>Good plenty of Pitch and Tar is there made, there being particular persons that have made above a thousand barrels.</P>
<P>Here is great plenty of Oake for Pipe staves, which are a good Commodity in the <HI>Maderas, Canaryes, Bar∣bados,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Leeward Islands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sumack. Sumack</HI> growes in great abundance natu∣rally, so undoubtedly would <HI>Woad, Madder</HI> &amp; <HI>Sa-Flo∣wer,</HI> if planted.</P>
<P><HI>Drugs. Jallop, Sassaparilla, Turmerick, Sassafras, Snake-root,</HI> &amp; divers others.</P>
<P>In short. This Country being of the same Clymate and Temperature of <HI>Aleppo, Smyrna, Antioch, Judea,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> the richest in <HI>China,</HI> will (I conceive) produce any thing which those Countrys do, were the Seeds brought into it.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>
<P>The Tools that men who goe thither ought to take with them are these, <HI>viz.</HI> An Ax, a Bill, and a broad Hoe, &amp; grabbing Hoe, for every man, and a cross cut Saw to every four men, a Whip-saw, a set of Wedges and Fraus and Betle-Rings to every family, and some Reaping Hooks and Sythes, as likewise Nails of all sorts, Hooks, Hinges, Bolts &amp; Locks for their Houses.</P>
<P>The Merchandizes which sell best in <HI>Carolina,</HI> are Linnen and Woollen, and all other Stufs to make clothes of, with Thread Sowing Silk, Buttons, Ribbons, Hats, Stockings, Shoes, &amp;c. which they sell at very good rates, and for these goods any man may purchase the Provision he hath need of.</P>
<P>The Passage of a man or woman to <HI>Carolina</HI> is five Pound, Ships are going thither all times of the year. Some of the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> or my self, will be every Tuesday at 11 of the clock at the <HI>Carolina</HI>-Coffee-house in <HI>Burching</HI>-Lane near the Royal Exchange, to inform all people what Ships are going, or any other thing whatsoever.</P>
