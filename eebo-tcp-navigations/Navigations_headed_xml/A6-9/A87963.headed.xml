<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry to find by yours, that in <HI>En∣gland</HI> you have no very good Opinion of us here, in this critical Juncture; but allow me to tell you, that though you have more Strength than we, we seem at least to have as great Zeal. I shall give you on∣ly the bare Matter of Fact. The Chancellor having an Express from Mr. <HI>Johnston</HI> our Se∣cretary at <HI>London,</HI> called the Council, and imparted to them Her Majesties Pleasure, for putting the Kingdom in a posture of Defence, that we might not be surprized in case our Enemies from abroad should make any at∣tempt upon our Coast, or in our Neighbour∣hood, as it seems they intended; upon which the Council, in two or three meetings, did what belong'd to them to do, in the following particulars.</P>
<P>The Commander in chief of the Forces had immediately Orders to post them so, as that they could conveniently and speedily meet upon occasion; and in order to this, a Thou∣sand Horse and Dragoons are to lye at <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> or not far from it.</P>
<P>The Governors and Commanders of Ca∣stles and Forts were sent for, and Enquiry made what Stores and Provisions they had in them, and Orders given to furnish them with Provisions for six Months, and with all neces∣sary Ammunition; for which end such quan∣tities of Powder and other Ammunition as were to be had here, were order'd to be bought, and Orders were sent over the King∣dom to the other Towns, for sending to the Council an account of what Powder or other Ammunition was any where to be found: And in the mean while, the Magistrates of the place were order'd to take care, that none of it be sold without their Authority.</P>
<P>Upon some Information which the Council receiv'd, particular care hath been taken of the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by removing all suspected and unnecessary People out of it, and by put∣ting one of the inferiour Officers under an Ar∣rest. Upon information that many disaffected People were come to Town, and some lately from abroad, the Gates of the Town were shut, and a general Search was made, and some few apprehended; but for the greater secre∣cy in time coming, the Council signed a War∣rant to the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> to seize on the Arms and Horses of persons whom he should judge dis∣affected, and such persons themselves, whom he should keep in Custody till they were pre∣sented by him to the Council at its next mee∣ting. The Magistrates of this City were cal∣led for, and the care of the same recommen∣ded to them, particularly, to double their Guards, and to have the Names of all those that come hither every night, and that are not Inhabitants, to be brought to them; and that the Magistrates consider those Names, and de∣liver to the Chancellor at least once every week Lists of such of them as are suspected or unknown. The Council hath likewise orde∣red, That Fencible-men, and Heretors, (that is, as you call 'em, the Gentry and richest sort of Freeholders) all over the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> to be in a readiness with their Horses and Arms to meet under their several Commanders upon Advertisement given them, either by particular Order, or by the signal of Fires upon Beacons, which are order'd to be kindled upon the first appearance of a Fleet on the Coast. Letters are also sent to all the Members of Council, requiring them to attend; and the Council or Committees of Council are to sit every day during the present Alarms.</P>
<P>The Council being inform'd, that some dis∣affected Church-men prayed either for the late Government, or not for this, or in such ambi∣guous words, that their meaning was clear enough to be understood they meant the late King, ordered the Proclamation which I send you inclosed to be publish'd. The Council had publish'd the other Proclamation, which I also send you, some time before; but I send it to shew you, that the generality of our Church-men are well inclin'd.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, whatever Zeal you in <HI>England</HI> may have inwardly, we do hitherto at least shew as much.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are <HI>Discontents</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> among us, but the subject of them is either the lesser concerns of what generally we take to be Religion, and for which sometimes <HI>we</HI> may in∣deed <HI>considerately</HI> enough <HI>venture,</HI> but sure, will ne'r in a plain case throw away the greater; or it is Remains of Animosities from the memory of the Violences of the late Reigns; but to en∣deavour to bring back those Reigns, were an odd way of resenting such Violences, and which one would think no man in these King∣doms, that has either Sense or Honesty, should be guilty of. I am</P>

<SALUTE>To Macers of Our Privy Council, Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly, and severally, specially constitute Greeting:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Forasmuch, as albeit, by the Act of the Meeting of Estates of this our Antient Kingdom, Dated the 13th day of <HI>April, 1689,</HI> Our Leidges were Certified, not to own or acknowledge the late K. <HI>James</HI> the Second for their King, but that they, and every one of them, should render their dutiful Obedience to Us; and in particular, that all the Ministers of the Gospel within this Kingdom should publickly Pray for Us, as King and Queen of this Realm, under the Pains and Certifications specified in the said Act: As also, We with Advice of Our Estates of Parli∣ament, by Our Act of 22th of <HI>July, 1690.</HI> Or∣dained the said Act and Proclamation of the Estates of this our Kingdom, to be put to further Executi∣on, against all such Ministers who had not given O∣bedience thereto, by praying for Us, in manner men∣tioned in the said Act: And that the Lords of Our Privy Council should proceed therein, or im∣power other Magistrates to do the same within their respective bounds, as they should see Cause. Yet nevertheless, the said Acts have been so far from receiving the punctual and exact Obedience due to them, That many Preachers have either presumed wholly to neglect Praying for Us, as King and Queen of this Realm, conform to the saids Acts, or at least have so far testified a want of Ingenuity and Plainness required in a Duty of this Nature, that they make use of such ambiguous and unclear Ex∣pressions in their Prayers, that the hearers cannot distinctly know they Pray for Us, to the Great Di∣sparagement of the saids Laws, and contempt of Our Authority. Therefore We, with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, do strictly require and Command the Sheriff of the several Shires, Bai∣lies of Regalities, Stewarts of Stewarties, and Magistrats of the Burghs Royal of this Kingdom within their Bounds and Jurisdictions respective, to make due and exact tryal what Ministers Preach∣ing in Churches or Meeting-Houses, within their re∣spective bounds, Pray not ordinarly for Us, in such circumstantiat Terms, as their Hearers may distinct∣ly know that they Pray for Us, as King and Queen of this Realm; and for that effect, We with the Advice foresaid, Hereby Require and Impower the several Magistrats respective foresaids, to conveen and call before them such persons as they shall think fit, to give Information and Evidence against such Ministers Preaching in Churches or Meeting-Houses, who fail in their Obedience to the Acts above-men∣tioned, in manner above set down, and that the saids Magistrats respective, Transmit under their Hands, to the Clerks of Our Privy Council, betwixt and the first day of <HI>June</HI> next to come, (for such as are on this side of the Water of <HI>Tay,</HI> and the fifteenth day of the said Month, for these on the other side thereof,) the Names of the several Ministers offend∣ing in the Premisses, with the place of their resi∣dence, and the original Information and Evidence they have received and taken against them, to the Effect they may be Prosecute with all Rigor, and the Penalties and Certifications in the saids Laws con∣tained, justly Inflicted and Executed against them. With Certification to the saids respective Magistrats who fail herein, they shall be repute as Connivers at, and Abettors of the saids Offenders, and negligent in the Execution and performance of their Offices and Duty committed to them, and prosecute as such accor∣dingly. Our Will is Herefore, and we Charge you strictly and Command, That incontinent these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the Mercat cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of <HI>Edin¦burgh,</HI> and to the remanent Mercat-crosses of the Head-Burghs of the several Sheres of this Our An∣tient Kingdom, and there; in Our Name and Au∣thority, by open Proclamation, make intimation of the Premisses: And Ordains these Presents to be Printed and Published in manner foresaid.</P>

<P>Forasmuch as several Synods, and others of this Church, have applyed to the Lords of our Privy Council, that they would interpose their Au∣thority, for indicting and keeping a solemn National Fast and Humiliation, in all the Kirks and Meet∣ing-houses of this our ancient Kingdom, to implore the Blessing of the Lord upon us in our Counsels and Undertakings, in defence of the true Reformed Re∣ligion, and of these Lands, and relief of the Oppres∣sed abroad; and especially, that God would coun∣tenance Us in the present War, preserving our Royal Person, and giving Success to our Arms by Sea and Land, and preserve and establish the Protestant Religion at home and abroad.
