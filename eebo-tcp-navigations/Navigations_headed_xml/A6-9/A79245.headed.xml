<HEAD>PRINCE CHARLES HIS LETTER TO The Right Honourable, the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of the City of <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right trusty and well-beloved, we greet you well.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VVE have and shall endeavour to give satisfaction to the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> in the grounds of our present proceedings. But we thinke fit notwithstanding, to make a particular addresse to you, being extreamly desirous that the City of <HI>London</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>should be fully satisfied that our intentions are just and honorable, for the peace and happinesse of all his Majesties subjects.</P>
<P>And we cannot despair of gaining a belief and con∣fidence with you, when it shall appear that Our acti∣ons and proceedings are conformable to our profes∣sions, and in order to those publique ends, and that hap∣py settlement of the Kingdom, which we have propo∣sed as the chief end of all our endeavours.</P>
<P>And we further think fit to assure you, that we are so far from intending violence to the persons or goods of any of Our Fathers Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> or any other particular advantage therein, that our only aym and end is to procure a subsistance for the Navy at Sea under Our Command, that thereby we may be inabled to protect the Ships, Vessels and Goods, and to secure the Trade, not only of the City of <HI>London,</HI> but of all other his Majesties good subjects.</P>
<P>And being for the present utterly unable to provide for so great a charge, as having been for some yeeres deprived as well of our own estate, as of the supplies We might have drawn from the bounty of the <HI>King</HI> Our Royall Father,</P>
<P>We think fit to have recourse to you▪ desiring you to supply Us with such necessaries and subsistance, as may tend to the supportment of the Navy now under Our Command.</P>
<P>And being thus furnished by you in this neces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, We shall immediatly discharge all ships of Marchan∣dize which have been stayed by Our Fleet, and shall carefully hereafter use Our utmost endeavours for
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>protecting the Ships and Goods, and secure the Trade and Commerce of the said City, and other his Maje∣sties Cities, Cinque-ports, and Town, which we con∣ceive to be the only, proper, and naturall imployments of his Majesties Navy; and for which, as for other reasons, it hath alwayes been maintained out of the Customs paid to his Majesty, out of which, as soon as it shall be in Our power, We shall take care to have the said sum or sums repaid you. And so desiring a present supply, the pressing necessities of the Fleet ad∣mitting no delay, We bid you heartily farewell.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>By Letters from the Hague in <HI>Holland</HI> it is adverti∣zed, That the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and his councel, hath had some consultation touching the Earl of <HI>VVarwicks</HI> an∣choring neer the Fleet Royall, &amp; hearing of his Lord∣ships great proffers to the Fleet, <HI>viz. Indempnity</HI> and <HI>Money,</HI> His Highnesse posted towards <HI>Goree,</HI> came a∣board the Fleet, and expressed himself in severall de∣claratory speeches to the Sea-men, whose presence, caused great acclamations of joy, and say they are re∣solved to live and dy with his Highnesse. As for the L. Admirals fighting with them, its said, the St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes do in∣terpose between with 15 fayl, there's no remedy but those ships must escape to vex the narrow seas: there's much ado to raise land men, &amp; borrow ships to make a new commotion in <HI>England,</HI> but little fruit appears.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>A Declaration of the proceedings of a party for the King within the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the resolution of the Army touching the same.</HEAD>
<P>THE great insolency of the Royal party with∣in and about the City of London, occasions much jealousie from the Army; the hatred and malice of the Royalists being so great, that it over swayes their discretion so much, that they cannot keep themselves within the bounds of ordinary civi∣lity, and discover themselves by seeking their private revenge; as appears by their late horrid action execu∣ted upon certain Members of the Army neer the Strand, who by some of the bloudy Conspirators were most barbarously murthered in their Beds. This inhumane Design strikes terrour to the well-affected party, who being much perplexed thereat, acquaints the Army therewith; insomuch that some of the com∣manders forthwith sends a letter to the City, the effect whereof followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>We are much startled at the insolency of the trayte∣rous slaves in</HI> London, <HI>to kill two Officers of our Army, one in his bed, and the other with a cowardly stab, and of their intended attempt to pistoll our Generall, besides many assaults upon Members of Parliament, and their Design to have massacred fourscore of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We do protest, if the Royall slaves continue their inso∣lency, and put uny of these Designs into execution, we will for every mans life take one hundred of their owr party, and according to the quality of each massacred person, and will hang up their heads on spires of steeples, that the world may see the just judgment of God upon these Rebels and Traytors, which his Maiesty confesses are
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>guilty of all the innocent bloud of the four bundred thou∣sand soules that have perished in this War.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Letter was thought fit to be published to the view of all persons whatsoever, whereby all whom it may concern, may take notice of the sense and resolu∣tion of the Army, and their reall and candid Desires to prevent the effusion of bloud for the future.</P>
<P>And do further declare, That they look upon the ci∣ty of <HI>London,</HI> with a tender eye and affection, being re∣solved to ingage both life and fortunes, for the defence and preservation thereof, against all opposition what∣soever.</P>
<P>Further declaring▪ That it is the resolution and de∣sire of the army, to use their utmost endeavours for the supporting all those who have adhered to them, e∣ven in the great and perilous times of War, and to act upon such principles, that may tend to the publique safety of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>ON Tuesday <HI>Octob.</HI> 3. By an Expresse from <HI>Scot∣land</HI> it was advertized, That the Royalists of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> have been very active in the Kingdom of <HI>Den∣mark;</HI> for the arming of a party against this King∣dom, and after some consultation touching the present affairs of this Nation, 10000 Arms were designed for them by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and shipping appointed to tran∣sport t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em into <HI>Scotland,</HI> who accordingly arrived in Lieth Road, thinking to joyn with the Scots Royalists, but being discovered by the Marq. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> a party were commanded out in severall long Boats, and smal Vessels, who soon boarded the Danish ships, seized on all the Ordnance, arms and ammunition, and secured the ships in the Harbour.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P><HI>A bloudy Fight at Sea.</HI></P>
<P>On Tuesday last, we received intelligence from <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> That there hath hapned a bloudy Fight neer <HI>Rye,</HI> an English Haven town, and garrison'd by the Par∣liament, the manner thus. Major <HI>Gibbon</HI> (the Gover∣nour) being allarm'd from an Irish-man of War, who had chased three ships belonging to the said Garrison, immediatly man'd severall long Boats with musketiers and made towards him, and after a bloudy and sharp dispute, rescued the <HI>Rye</HI> ships, and killed nine of the Re∣bels, with the losse of two men</P>
<P>On Wednesday <HI>Octob.</HI> 4. Both Houses debated His Maj. Letter, and voted, That the said Letter is unsatis∣factory, declaring, That they will proceed according to the Propositions, and none other. His Majesty re-as∣sumed the Treaty on <HI>Munday,</HI> but its hoped that He will concur in matter and form to what the Parlia∣ment desire.</P>
