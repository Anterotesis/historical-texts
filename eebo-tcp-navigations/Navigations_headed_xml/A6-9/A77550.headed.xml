<HEAD>BRITANICUS HIS BLESSING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HElls blessings on thee, my blasphemous son,</L>
<L>Thou hast thy brother <HI>Rabshekah</HI> out-done.</L>
<L><HI>Shimei</HI> was Courtly, (if compar'd to thee)</L>
<L>Thou every week writ'st higher Blasphemie.</L>
<L><HI>Korah</HI>'s gain-saying, if compar'd to thine,</L>
<L>Was Petit-treason: Thou in every line</L>
<L>Out-vy'st all these. Thou bravely play'st thy part,</L>
<L>And to our service shew'st a loyall heart</L>
<L>All I can promise, is, when thou shalt come,</L>
<L>Thou shalt be glorious for thy martyrdome.</L>
<L>Nay thou shalt set thy house in order too,</L>
<L>And in thy death <HI>Achitophel</HI> out-doe.</L>
<L>Thou taught'st the people better to rebell,</L>
<L>Then why should'st thou not in thy death excell?</L>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<L>Both him and all those who came here before,</L>
<L>Since thou (deare son) hast done for us much more,</L>
<L><HI>Vicisti Galilaee</HI> thou shalt cry</L>
<L>(As <HI>Iulian</HI> did) and cast thy blood on hie.</L>
<L>Or thou shalt die like <HI>Arrius,</HI> who withstood</L>
<L>The Nazarite, voiding both thy guts and blood.</L>
<L>Yet we will write for thee an Epitaph,</L>
<L>Which who ere reads, he shall not choose but laffe:</L>
</LG>
<Q><LG>
<L>Hic jacet Britannicus, Scurra, Rabula, Lixa, Lanista,</L>
<L>Et filius Belial, &amp; Regis Antagonista.</L>
</LG></Q>
<LG>
<L>Here lies <HI>Britannicus</HI> that snarling cur,</L>
<L>That son of <HI>Belial,</HI> who kept such a stur:</L>
<L>Who every Monday spent his stock of spleen</L>
<L>In venemous railing on the King and Queen:</L>
<L>Whom though they both in goodnes should forgive,</L>
<L>Yet we have vow'd <HI>Britannicus</HI> must not live.</L>

<HEAD>BRITANICUS HIS VVELCOME.</HEAD>
<L>I Joy to think what Bone-fires shall be made,</L>
<L>When thou shalt come, great Master of our trade.</L>
<L>Hells brazen gates shall be set ope for thee,</L>
<L>And churlish <HI>Cerberus</HI> shall refuse his fee.</L>
<L>And vvhen thy soule shall enter into hell,</L>
<L>It shall be welcom'd vvith a hideous yell.</L>
<L>We vvill prepare such Musique for thine eare</L>
<L>As that vvhich pleas'd <HI>Caligula</HI> to heare.</L>
<L>He took delight to heare the parting grones</L>
<L>Of tortur'd vvretches, and vvould praise their tones.</L>
<L>And now the meanest soule imprisoned here,</L>
<L>Will in his tortures great <HI>Caligula</HI> jeere:</L>
<L>For we confesse it is our greatest pleasure</L>
<L>To see our tallyes struck, and equall measure.</L>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>Our inner roomes shall be perfum'd for thee,</L>
<L>With <HI>Auri calcus, Sulphur, Mercurie.</HI></L>
<L>And for the strength of it I dare presume</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Spaine,</HI> nor <HI>Rome,</HI> hath any such perfume.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Sodoms</HI> Apples we will Lambs-wool make,</L>
<L>And drink carouses of the Stygian Lake.</L>
<L>This must thy Garnish (sonne) thy welcome be,</L>
<L>And all my Legions shall attend on thee.</L>
<L>Nay more, to shew thou art a welcome guest,</L>
<L>We will prepare for thee a royall Feast.</L>
<L>Two fat Presbyters sides, collerd in Lawne,</L>
<L>In Jesuites urin souc'd, shall be thy Brawne.</L>
<L>With <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> we will grind thy mustard,</L>
<L>And of <HI>Hienna</HI>'s milk wee'll make thy custard,</L>
<L>With th'egges of Aspes. O tis a curious dish!</L>
<L>And for a Gusto doth exceed mans wish.</L>
<L>Flapdragon we will drink instead of Wine,</L>
<L>For to this Brawne we drink this Muscadine.</L>
<L>This liquor is by cunning Chymists drawn</L>
<L>From severall Mineralls to digest the Brawn.</L>
<L>This with our very breaths to flames will turn,</L>
<L>And like Flapdragon in our stomachs burn.</L>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
<L>An Ollio we must have, a dish of State,</L>
<L>(A Spanish dish) ne'r heard of till of late.</L>
<L>The Nymphaes of six vvanton sisters vvombes,</L>
<L>In their own liquor stew'd vvith Stygean plummes.</L>
<L>Tvvelve Round-heads inchpinnes of the largest size,</L>
<L>Minc'd vvith the marrovv of a Letchers thighs.</L>
<L>Two dozen of pious preaching Sisters tongues,</L>
<L>As many Woodcocks heads, two Foxes lungs.</L>
<L>Who eats this Ollio, he shall quickly find</L>
<L>A strange encrease of braine, and length of wind.</L>
<L>Twelve Independents Gammons shall be set</L>
<L>Upon the board, well smoak'd, and black as jet.</L>
<L>(For the Westphalians learnt this art of me,</L>
<L>I was the first ere us'd this Cookerie.)</L>
<L>My costly Hogoost I remembred not,</L>
<L>Which is a dish that must not be forgot.</L>
<L>Six Anabaptists hearts with Garlick stuck:</L>
<L>Two Jesuites braines, a sincere Brownists Pluck,</L>
<L>Stew'd in a Traitours skull with sublimate:</L>
<L>We vvith this Hogoost poyson many a State.</L>
<L>We for our Fruit will of those Apples have</L>
<L>Which <HI>Eve</HI> our Mother unto <HI>Adam</HI> gave.</L>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>Our Cheese must be rebellious too, and made</L>
<L>Among those States where you have learnt your trade</L>
<L>Then wee'll conclude our Feast; and drink a Health</L>
<L>In Royall blood to our new Common-wealth.</L>
<L>Thus you may see what honour shall be done</L>
<L>To him the Devill styles his dearest sonne.</L>
