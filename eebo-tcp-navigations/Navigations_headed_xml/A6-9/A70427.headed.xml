<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOme Readers may imagine that it is no hard matter to describe a Country so near, so full of Learned men and so stor'd with excellent Books as <HI>France</HI> is, espe∣cially for a Native of it, because of the many helps an Author may meet with. I have made use of all those I could come at, Books, Maps, Memoirs, Inquiries of living persons, besides what I knew of my own. But I was soon aware, that the Description of those who have Written before me, even in the middle of that Kingdom, are very imperfect. All the Journeys into <HI>France</HI> I have read, as <HI>du Verdier, Sinceri Accii Itinerarium Galliae, Le Grand Tour de France, les Delices de la France,</HI> and the late <HI>Voyages Historiques de l'Eu∣rope</HI> observe neither order nor method, confound∣ing not only the several Counties into which each great Government is subdivided, but even the great Governments themselves. As to Geographers <HI>Comminges</HI> and <HI>Darity</HI> are too old and confus'd. The Maps of <HI>Sanson</HI> the Father and the Son, are excellent, those
<PB REF="5"/> of <HI>Du Val</HI> next to them, and by compar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng them together, as I have done, one may be pretty sure of the Longitude and Latitude, situation and distance of places. But neither of the <HI>Sansons</HI> has made a modern and particular Description of <HI>France,</HI> and that of <HI>Du Val</HI> is too short and not methodical enough. As to Anti∣quities. <HI>Andre du Chesne</HI> in his curious Inqui∣ries concerning the Towns of <HI>France</HI> is full of Fables, and ought not to be follow'd but very cautiously, tho he is a Man of a vast reading and much to be commended for having pu∣blished several Historians of the middle Age that have Written of the <HI>French</HI> affairs, and made use of them in his Antiquities of that Country and Monarchy. <HI>Joseph Scaliger,</HI> how Learned soever he may be in other things, does not come near <HI>Du Chesne</HI> in this, and proposes many bold conjectures, concerning the ancient names of the <HI>French</HI> Cities and Countries, for which he often gives no other authority but his bare saying. <HI>Baudrand</HI> is but a pitiful compiler of modern Books, who never look'd into ancient Authors. <HI>Sanson</HI> in his <HI>Pharus Galliae Antiquae</HI> is more accurate than the fore men∣tioned Writers, and has made many curious and useful discoveries. But the most exact of all in my Judgment is <HI>Adrian de Valois</HI> in his <HI>Notitia Galliarum,</HI> as to the <HI>Latin</HI> names of Places, for there is hardly any thing else in that huge <HI>Folio,</HI> besides some few hints of History to be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther'd here and there with great trouble.</P>
<P>I have perus'd three other modern Geogra∣phers which I must not forget, <HI>viz. Robbe</HI>'s <HI>Memoires Geographiques, Morery</HI>'s <HI>Grand Diction∣naire
<PB REF="5"/> Historique and Geographique,</HI> with the sup∣plement of <HI>Perayre,</HI> and <HI>De la Croix</HI>'s <HI>Geographie Ʋniverselle.</HI> As to the first, he cannot commit many faults, for he has almost nothing besides <HI>French</HI> names; but as soon as he presumes to say something more, for instance to determine the extent of a Government or its Latitude and Longitude, one may very near be sure to find him in an error. As to <HI>Morery,</HI> it is pity he did not live long enough, or had not the conveniency to read ancient Authors. His want of Learning in Ecclesiastical History and Mysteries of State makes him too passionate, when he speaks of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> and leads him into many mistakes as to <HI>Latin</HI> names and other Antiquities. As to <HI>De la Croix,</HI> all his performance consists in ha∣ving put an ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idgment of <HI>Morery</HI> into <HI>Rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>'s method, and a very unjudicious one too, for he leaves out what is most curious and essential in the Great Dictionary; and the rest he takes it word for word, unless it be to corrupt and abridg it again, but for the most part he is so faithful as to transcribe the very faults of the press, as p. 200. l. 29. <HI>Anvers</HI> for <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> Whatever he adds of his own here and there, as the Latitude and Longitude and the distance of places is always fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, for he never took the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of looking into one of <HI>Sanson</HI>'s or <HI>du Val</HI>'s Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. For instance, p. 201 he says that, <HI>No-gent-le-Roy is situated on the River Eure,</HI> be∣twixt <HI>Dreux and Chartres,</HI> which is true. Then he adds <HI>Dreux or Drocum is upon the Blaise,</HI> &amp;c. The worst Map in the World might have shewn him that those three Towns are seated on the same River. It's true <HI>More<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> has lead
<PB REF="6"/> him into that mistake, but what his pardona∣ble in the compiler of a great Dictionary, who is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out by the length and tediousness of the Work, and distracted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ariety of matters, is not so in a Geographer. Besides that, there is a River call'd <HI>Baise</HI> in <HI>Guienne,</HI> but no River <HI>Blaise</HI> in all <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>A Vocabulary of this Authors Faults would make up a small Volume, and therefore I shall only add an instance or two more. P. 309 he calls twice after <HI>Robbe, Briancon</HI> a Bishoprick Neither <HI>Morery</HI> nor any other Author that I know of mentions any such thing: For the <HI>Brianconnois</HI> were ever as they are still a de∣pendency of the <HI>Caturiges</HI> and the Prelate of <HI>Ambrun.</HI> P. 320. He puts after <HI>Robbe, Serres</HI> in <HI>Viennois,</HI> that is in the Northern part of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> tho it lies in <HI>Gapencois</HI> or in the South of that Province. This as true as what he says p. 17 that, at the beginning of this War, <HI>the French King put</HI> 700000 <HI>Men in Arms;</HI> and that <HI>he alone has more Religion, Merit, Glory, Revenus and Soldiers, then all the Crown'd Heads of Europe together,</HI> without excepting his dear Ally the Turk.</P>
<P>The former Description of <HI>France</HI> being so faulty, I let the Reader judg what trouble I have been at in chusing the best, and including what ever seem'd to me most essential in the Compass of this Book. It is divided into two parts, whereof the first is an introduction to the Second, a general survey of the whole Country, and an explication of several Offices and terms that can scarce be fully unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stood without it. Tho this part be very short, yet
<PB REF="6"/> you will find there several things concerning the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy and Politicks, the power of their Parliaments, the state of their Nobility and Gentry, the increase of Popery, the breaking up of the Reformation, the causes that retarded its progress, and have altogether eclips'd it in that Kingdom; all which is not easily to be met with any where-else. The second contains an Historical and Geographical Descrip∣tion of the twelve Great Governments, into which <HI>France</HI> uses to be divided, besides <HI>Lor∣raine</HI> and the County of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> There I treat of the different Revolutions of Each Go∣vernment, of its ancient Inhabitants, of its <HI>Gaulish</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> names and other Antiquities, of its borders, extent, subdivisions, Air, Cli∣mate, Fertility, Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, natural Curiosities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I set down the di∣stance of the Capital Cities from <HI>Paris</HI> or from each other, and of the most considerable Towns in each Government from their Capital, their <HI>Latin</HI> names, Antiquities, Lords and Titles, their Civil and Ecclesiastical Government, with the several Changes they have undergone, their most remarkable Buildings, Trade, Inhabitants, the Great Men they have produc'd, their Soyl and Territory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the ancient and modern Bounds and Di∣visions of <HI>France;</HI> Of her Mountains, Ports, Rivers and Forests.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FRANCE</HI> has not changed her ancient Limits to the South, West and North; seeing, as <HI>Gallia</HI> of old, it has to the West, the Ocean of <HI>Aquitain;</HI> to the North, the <HI>British</HI> Ocean as far as <HI>Calis,</HI> by which Sea it is divided from <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea on the South, which is also called the <HI>French</HI> Sea, with the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains that part her from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>As to her Limits on the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>North-East,</HI> they are very uncertain, especially in this time of War: Before the late Conquests, it was bounded by the County of <HI>Burgundy Elzas,</HI> the Dukedom of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Barrois,</HI> and part of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands; viz.</HI> the Province of <HI>Luxembourg, Hainault, Bra∣bant,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> But at present the <HI>French</HI> King is Master of all those Countries, except of a little part: So that his Kingdom has al∣most recover'd its ancient Limits on that side <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the Mouth of the <HI>Meuse.</HI></P>
<P>Her Form is almost round, and in a man∣ner oval, so that she is as broad as long, and may be of 25 days Journey in length, from <HI>Brest</HI> to <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> and of as many in breadth
<PB N="3" REF="8"/> from <HI>Dunkerque</HI> to <HI>Perpignan,</HI> that is 250 Leagues, which make about 1000 Leagues in circuit.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Galli,</HI> called <HI>Celtae,</HI> transplant∣ed themselves into <HI>Asia,</HI> where they gave their Name to a whole Country, called <HI>Ga∣latia, Gallo-Graecia,</HI> or <HI>Gallia Minor,</HI> and now <HI>Chiangare,</HI> being part of <HI>Natoly,</HI> or <HI>Less Asia.</HI> Another Colony of the <HI>Gallick Nation</HI> having passed the <HI>Alpes,</HI> conquered a good part of <HI>Italy,</HI> which made the <HI>Romans</HI> to di∣stinguish them into <HI>Cisalpins</HI> and <HI>Transalpins.</HI> However, the Country on this side the <HI>Alpes</HI> retained the ancient Name of <HI>Gallia;</HI> and falling afterwards under the Power of the <HI>Romans,</HI> was divided by <HI>Augustus</HI> into four Parts, <HI>viz. Gallia Narbonensis,</HI> called also <HI>Gallia Braccata,</HI> because of the <HI>Braccae,</HI> a kind of broad long Coats the Inhabitants wore. The other Parts were, the <HI>Celtick Gallia,</HI> or that of <HI>Lyons;</HI> the <HI>Belgick,</HI> and the <HI>Aquitanick,</HI> which had all three the common Surname of <HI>Gallia Comata,</HI> because the People of those Provinces suffered their hair to grow long.</P>
<P><HI>Aquitain</HI> at <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>'s time was com∣prehended between the River <HI>Garumn,</HI> the Sea, and the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains; but was afterwards extended by <HI>Augustus</HI> as far as the River <HI>Loire</HI> on the North, and the Mountains of the <HI>Cevennes</HI> on the East, and subdivided into first, second and third <HI>Aqui∣tain.</HI> Its ancient Inhabitants had several
<PB N="4" REF="9"/> different Names, which we shall mention in the particular Description of that part of <HI>France.</HI> It suffices at present to observe, that it is now wholly in the <HI>French</HI> King's hands, but heretofore belong'd for the most part to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Celtick Gallia,</HI> or that of <HI>Lyons,</HI> was included between the Ocean on the West and North-West, the <HI>Belgick</HI> on the North-East and East, <HI>Aquitain</HI> and the Province of <HI>Narbonne</HI> on the South. It was divided into first, second, third, fourth and fifth; in which Division, 'tis worthy our Notice, that a good part of the 2d and 3d was either the ancient Patrimony of our English Kings, as <HI>Normandy;</HI> or fell to them by Marriage and Inheritance, as <HI>Le Maine, Anjou,</HI> and <HI>Tou∣raine.</HI> As to the fifth <HI>Lugdunensis,</HI> call'd also <HI>Provincia Sequanorum,</HI> before the last Peace of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King possessed no∣thing in it: but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having yielded him the County of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and he being Ma∣ster of <HI>Savoy, Newchastel, Elzas</HI> and <HI>Sungow,</HI> the Republick of the <HI>Suitzers,</HI> which lays in∣closed in his Dominions, must necessarily de∣pend upon him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Narbonensis</HI> had <HI>Aquitain</HI> on the West, the <HI>Celtick</HI> on the North, the <HI>Alpes</HI> on the East, the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea and the <HI>Pyre∣naean</HI> Mountains on the South. It was divi∣ded into first, second and third; but after∣wards extended farther on the East, beyond

<P>The <HI>Belgick,</HI> divided into first and second, was of a vast extent, comprehending not only the Seventeen Provinces of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> except <HI>Friese, Groeningen</HI> and <HI>Overyssel,</HI> but also <HI>Picardy, Champaign,</HI> part of the <HI>Isle of France, Lorrain, Elzas,</HI> the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege,</HI> the four Electorates along the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the Dukedoms of <HI>Cleves</HI> and <HI>Juliers.</HI> The <HI>French,</HI> who in the former Reigns possessed but a small part of the <HI>Belgick,</HI> have almost swallow'd up all that Country, there remain∣ing nothing entire, but the Dukedoms of <HI>Cleves</HI> and <HI>Juliers,</HI> and the Dominions of the States-General; for the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege</HI> and the four Electotates are either dis∣membred, or lie open before them.</P>
<P>The Division of <HI>France,</HI> as to the Civil Government, may be made into certain Pro∣vinces: The twelve Ancient, whose Deputies had their Seat in the general Assemblies of the Kingdom, are, 1. <HI>Picardy.</HI> 2. <HI>Normandy.</HI>

<P>In reference to the Courts of Justice, <HI>France</HI> is divided into ten Parliaments, to which the Seneschalships or Bailywicks do answer.</P>
<P>The Names of those ten Parliaments are, <HI>Paris; Toulouse,</HI> for <HI>Languedock</HI> and part of <HI>Guienne; Dijon,</HI> for the Dutchy of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Bresse; Roan,</HI> for <HI>Normandy; Bourdeaux,</HI> for <HI>Guyenne; Rennes,</HI> and lately <HI>Vannes,</HI> for <HI>Britanny; Grenoble,</HI> for <HI>Dauphiné; Aix,</HI> for <HI>Provence; Pau,</HI> for <HI>Bearn</HI> and <HI>Navar; Mets,</HI> for the Country of <HI>Messin</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI> which extends its Jurisdiction over all the conquer'd <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>There are Sovereign Courts of Justice at <HI>Brisach, Arras, Tournny, Perpignan</HI> and <HI>Pigne∣rol;</HI> they depend, for the most Part, on the Government of <HI>Picardy;</HI> but the Dutchy of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> is annexed to that of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> however, bares not the Title
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> of Parliament. The Parliament for the County of <HI>Burgundy</HI> is at <HI>Bezançon,</HI> whi∣ther the <HI>Spaniards</HI> transferr'd it from <HI>Dole,</HI> after that Province had been restored to them by the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chappelle,</HI> An. 1668.</P>
<P>There are sixteen Archbishopricks in <HI>France,</HI> nine of which pretend to the Right of Primacy; the seven others are, <HI>Paris, Tours, Auch, Alby, Tolouze, Ambrun,</HI> and <HI>Aix;</HI> the Primates are, <HI>Sens, Lyons, Bourges, Nar∣bonne, Roan, Bourdeaux, Vienne, Arles,</HI> and <HI>Rheims.</HI> The New Conquests have since added two Archbishopricks, <HI>viz.

<P>The <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains do not so much belong to <HI>France,</HI> which they do part from <HI>Spain,</HI> as the <HI>Cevennes,</HI> which are in the heart of the Country, and have been known to the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins</HI> under the Name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <HI>Gebenna,</HI> or <HI>Cebenna.</HI> They reach along <HI>Low Languedock</HI> to <HI>Au∣vergne,</HI> where they are extremely high.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> has also her Promontories upon the Coast of her Seas, as well Ocean as Mediterranean. On the West-side looking towards <HI>Britanny,</HI> and the North over∣against <HI>Kent,</HI> are those of the Ocean Sea; That of <HI>Talmond,</HI> or <HI>Talon du monde,</HI> is toward the South in the same Sea, with that of <HI>Buts,</HI> which has divers Names, and some others. Upon the Medi∣terranean
<PB N="8" REF="11"/> Sea are the Cape of St. <HI>Sigo,</HI> which is on the Coast of <HI>Provence,</HI> the Cape of <HI>Sete,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Agde</HI> in <HI>Languedock.</HI> She has but two Gulfs, the <HI>Aquitanick</HI> or <HI>Tarbellick,</HI> on the Ocean toward the West; and the great Gulf, called by the Ancients <HI>Sinus Gal∣licus,</HI> in the Mediterranean Sea.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> wants no good Ports, whether in the Ocean or Mediterranean Sea. In the Ocean, on the Coast of <HI>Britanny,</HI> are, <HI>Brest, Conquest, Blavet;</HI> and <HI>Rochell</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Poictou.</HI> In the Mediterranean <HI>Marseille</HI> and <HI>Toulon,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Provence,</HI> good and renowned Havens, by the Galleys which the French King keeps there. That on the Coast of <HI>Agde</HI> is also considerable.</P>
<P>The Rivers of <HI>France</HI> are many, very beautiful, and of long Course. The Chiefest are, the <HI>Seine,</HI> the <HI>Loire,</HI> the <HI>Garonne,</HI> and the <HI>Rhosne.</HI> The <HI>Garonne</HI> springs from the <HI>Pyrenaeans,</HI> and has always been the separa∣tion of the <HI>Aquitains</HI> from the <HI>Celtae,</HI> re∣ceives the <HI>Dourdogne,</HI> the <HI>Tart</HI> and <HI>Loth,</HI> and is lost in the Ocean. The <HI>Rhosne</HI> comes from the <HI>Alpes,</HI> crosses the Country of <HI>Valais,</HI> then the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> through which it runs without mixing its Waters with it, receives the <HI>Saone</HI> at <HI>Lyons,</HI> the <HI>Isere</HI> that runs at <HI>Grenoble,</HI> the <HI>Droume</HI> and the <HI>Durance,</HI> a dangerous River, and which has no certain wading; and lastly, empties it self into the Mediterranean Sea at the
<PB N="9" REF="11"/> <HI>Three Maries,</HI> within three Leagues of <HI>Arles,</HI> by six Channels. The <HI>Seine,</HI> which has its Original in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in the Woods of the Abbey of St. <HI>Seine,</HI> runs by <HI>Paris, Roan, Honfleur</HI> and <HI>Harfleur,</HI> and disgorges it self into the Sea at <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> with a delicate Channel, where it ebbs and flows. It receives, amongst other Rivers, the <HI>Marn,</HI> and the <HI>Oyse,</HI> which crosseth <HI>Picardy,</HI> and under <HI>Pont Oyse,</HI> towards <HI>Poissy,</HI> mixes with the <HI>Seine.</HI> The <HI>Isle of France</HI> is inclosed by the <HI>Seine</HI> to the East and South, and by the <HI>Oyse</HI> to the West. The <HI>Loire</HI> springs forth in <HI>Vivarez,</HI> a small Country of <HI>Languedock,</HI> passes by <HI>Velay,</HI> comes into <HI>Forest,</HI> to <HI>Nevers, Orleans, Blois, Amboise, Tours, Saumur,</HI> and disburthens it self in the Sea near <HI>Nantes</HI> in <HI>Britanny,</HI> with a Channel of four Leagues breadth. It is the largest River of <HI>France,</HI> as the <HI>Rhosne</HI> is the most rapid. It receives the River of <HI>Allier,</HI> which cometh out of <HI>Gevaudan</HI> in <HI>Languedock,</HI> and several o∣thers.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> abounds in lofty and pleasant Forests, that are not like those of <HI>Germany, Poland,</HI> and <HI>Transilvania,</HI> which by reason of their greatness and thickness are not so commodious for Hunting. That of <HI>Orle∣ance</HI> is the biggest and broadest. Besides those of <HI>Montargis,</HI> there are a great many in the Country of <HI>Maine,</HI> in <HI>Lower Britanny,</HI> in

<P><HI>FRANCE</HI> every where enjoyeth a ve∣ry wholsom and temperate Air, whence it proceeds that the Plague and contagious Diseases are not so frequent and dangerous there as in other Countries.</P>
<P>She is praised for her Fertility from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes, not only in her fair and spacious Plains, and in her Vallies, but also in her Mountains, which are Cultivated and bring forth Corn in such abundance; that besides the Provision of her Inhabitants, <HI>Spain</HI> is supplied with it from <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Langue∣doc.</HI> To these Provinces ought to be added those of <HI>Normandy, Beausse, Poictou, Xainconge, Picardy,</HI> which are also very plentiful in Corn. All sorts of Wines grow in <HI>France,</HI> and such as are Excellent too: <HI>Britany, Nor∣mandy,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/> and <HI>Picardy,</HI> by reason of the cold Air produce none; but all the other Pro∣vinces do abound with it. Those of <HI>Beausse</HI> grow especially about <HI>Orleance,</HI> and <HI>Toury: An∣jou</HI> has her White-Wines, which are in a par∣ticular Esteem; Those of <HI>Burgundy</HI> are sold off at <HI>Baulne, Sens,</HI> and <HI>Auxerre,</HI> whereof great Quantities are brought to <HI>Paris. Guy∣enne</HI> is very well provided with Wines, but those of <HI>Grave</HI> at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> those of <HI>Gailla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Rabestens,</HI> are most esteemed; and by the <HI>Garonne, Charante,</HI> and <HI>Loire,</HI> are Tran∣sported to <HI>England, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> The Muscadine Wines of <HI>Frontignan,</HI> and other Places near <HI>Montpellier</HI> in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> are carried to <HI>Paris,</HI> and Foreign Nations.</P>
<P>The Salt-Pits make the Third Wealth of that Kingdom, in which they are both good and plentiful. The King draws vast Revenues out of them, for the Inhabitants of every Province are furnished therewith at a very high Rate; and they are exported to Foreign Nations, as the <HI>Switzers, Dutch, English,</HI> and other Northern People. The Salt Pits of <HI>Languedoc</HI> at <HI>Pecais</HI> are the excellentest of all. There are some in <HI>Provence, Poictou, Xaintonge, Brouage,</HI> whither the Dutch come to fetch them.</P>
<P>The Hemp and Linnen of <HI>Lower Britany, Calis, Berry, Quercy, Rouergue,</HI> and other Places, bring likewise a great Trade, and a power of Money into <HI>France:</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reof

There are but some of her Provinces that produce Oyls, whose Air is the hottest and sweetest; Such as are <HI>Provence</HI> and <HI>Languedoc:</HI> Of these is a great Trade, not only in the very Kingdom, but even amongst Strangers. Fine Wool abounds in several Places of the Kingdom, especially in <HI>Berry, Soloigne, Normandy,</HI> and <HI>Languedoc;</HI> in all which Provinces very good and fine Cloaths are Woven, with Serges that are carried all over the Kingdom; and into <HI>Spain, Italy, Piedmont,</HI> and others Nations. She abounds in all manner of Fruit: In <HI>Normandy, Britany,</HI> and <HI>Picardy,</HI> is a huge quantity of Apples, of which they make Cyder, that supplies the want of Wine. Pears and other Winter-Fruit are better in these Provinces, and the Isle of <HI>France,</HI> where the Air is thickest, than in those that are more to the South; Which on the other hand are plentiful in choice Raisins, Figgs, Granads, Musk-Mellons, Apricots, Peaches, Nectarins, Almonds, and Nutts. Chesnuts are in the most Mountainous Countries; such as are <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> the <HI>Cevennes, Langue∣doc, Auvergne,</HI> the Country of <HI>Limoges,</HI> and <HI>Perigord.</HI> Wood is found there in some Places, which is Exported into several Fo∣reign Countries to Dye in Blue. Several of her Provinces do bear Saffron. Silk-Worms
<PB N="13" REF="13"/> are fed in <HI>Languedoc, Provence, Dau∣phiné,</HI> at <HI>Tours,</HI> at <HI>Caen</HI> in <HI>Normandy;</HI> and for this purpose a great number of Mul∣berry-Trees are kept. She is not lacking in good Pastures, both in the even and hilly Soil, to feed Cattle; whence comes abundance of Meat, as also Milk, Butter and Cheese: Capons, Pullets, and all manner of Fowl are here in Store; And Turky-Cocks and Hens are fed by Flocks; Hares, Conies, Partridges, and Thrushes do swarm. There is Rice to be seen in <HI>Provence,</HI> Pulse of all sorts, Flowers, Herbs, and Simples; Rose∣mary, Juniper, Myrtle-Trees, Sage, and all other Plants are to be found in it. Box grows to a great thickness in <HI>Normandy, Languedoc,</HI> and other Places, wherewith are made several small Moveables for Service, which Strangers make use of. Stones do grow in the Quarries; And here are ve∣ry fine Slates, especially in <HI>Anjou;</HI> and Marbles in <HI>Foix,</HI> and in some Places of <HI>Lan∣guedoc.</HI> All big Beasts for Game, as Fallow Deers, Chamois, Stags, Wild-Goats, are to be found in her Forrests; besides several good Races of Horses, of <HI>Burgundy, Norman∣dy, Britany, Auvergne, Poictou,</HI> the Country of <HI>Limoges, Gascony, Foix,</HI> and <HI>Languedoc;</HI> yet they are not so strong as those of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> whence they are brought to draw Carts and Coaches. <HI>Spain</HI> has Mules from <HI>Auvergne</HI> and <HI>Gevaudan.</HI></P>

<P>The Corn and Wines of <HI>France,</HI> with the Salt-Houses, and other Wares, are the most assured Mines she has; yet those of Gold and Silver are not wanting, though they are not wrought at. And it is not to be doubted but that in the Pyreneans, and other Moun∣tains of <HI>Auvergne, Rouergue, Gevaudan, Lan∣guedoc,</HI> and in the <HI>Cevennes,</HI> may be found Veins of Gold and Silver; as Germans who have visited and found them out have Related.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Inhabitants of <HI>France,</HI> and of their Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE French are Endowed with more Virtuos than Vices, by the Confession even of Strangers, who praise them for their Charity, hospitality, Courtesie, Valour, and Bravery; and for their being fit, and as 'twere, born to all that they are minded to Undertake in Learning, War, or Mecha∣nicks; wherein they very Expeditiously imi∣tate whatever they see perform'd by Stran∣gers. They are very cleanly in their Diet and Apparel, and very apt in the one or the other to go beyond their Means, Quality, and Birth; which, by comparing them to Spaniards, Italians, and other Nations, has been taken notice of. Their Cloathing, as to the Making, is never certain, no more as to the Mode then as to the Stuff, wherein continually they change, at least from year to year.</P>
<P>The Men here are Comelier and Stronger, and of a finer size than Spaniards and Italians, but not then the Germans, Dutch, or Eng∣lish. As to the Women, they are Hand∣somer In some Provinces than others; For in <HI>Normandy, Picardy,</HI> and on this side the <HI>Loire,</HI> they are commonly more agreeable
<PB N="16" REF="15"/> than in the ancient <HI>Aquitain;</HI> that is, in <HI>Auvergne, Perigord,</HI> the Country of <HI>Limoges, Gascony,</HI> and <HI>Ʋpper Languedoc.</HI> The other part of <HI>Guienne,</HI> especially at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> part of <HI>Dauphiné, Lower Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> shew more pleasing Faces, and even exquisite Beauties: As we have said that the French Man renders himself fit for every Thing, he is chiefly so in Arms and War-fare: He likewise gives himself over to Study, Eloquence, to all Arts, and to Merchandize: He carries freely his Trade to Foreign Nations, and there Manures the Land, and knows not to be Lazy: He is very Industrious, and Works merrily, though he is found fault with for not being Patient and willing to endure in War. The French Nobility are above all most rare Horsemen, and have a particular Care of their Honour, even to excess: witness, the damnable custom of Duels, which the Edicts of the present Prince have not yet been able totally to suppress. The People of <HI>France</HI> are generally Meek and Good every where, except in some few places, where they are a little too Blunt and Rustick. The Vulgar bears an extream Respect to great Persons, whether they be of the Nobility, Officers of Justice, or of the Revenues. Ecclesiasticks, and other Men of Long Gown, are especially Honoured; And there is hardly any Nation in the World that has so many Officers of all sorts
<PB N="17" REF="15"/> as the Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI> The Merchant, nay, and the very Tradesman, if at any time he becomes Wealthy, pushes his Children to it: And into several Parliaments of <HI>France,</HI> and other Courts of Justice, the Nobility Sues for Offices too; whence comes that in∣finite number of literate Men, though their Reward be but small, and that all Offices be Sold; which is not usual in other States of <HI>Europe.</HI> Thence also proceeds a swarm of Advocates, Sollicitors, Registers, Notaries, and other Men of Business, whose number has been extraordinarily increas'd by the late Edicts of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV, and his Creation for Money of an incredible number of new Officers, which must needs impoverish the Kingdom, and bring it at last to an utter Ruin. For either these new Offices will be suppress'd in time of Peace, and consequent∣ly a great many Families will be Ruin'd that have bestow'd their ready Money, and some their Estates upon these Employments: Or, if they be continued, the common Peo∣ple will be oppress'd by the multitude of Officers, and the number of Merchants, Trades and Husbandmen mightily dimi∣nish'd.</P>
<P>Another great Abuse that may prove at last the Ruin of <HI>France,</HI> is the extraordi∣nary increase of the Gentry; For whereas in <HI>England,</HI> younger Brothers even of the greatest Noblemen make no difficulty of
<PB N="18" REF="16"/> becoming Merchants, nay and Tradesmen too, if they have no inclination to Learn∣ing: The youngest Son of a simple Gen∣tleman in <HI>France</HI> would account it a great Dishonour to his Birth to do any thing but to wear a Gown, or a Sword; which makes that the French Gentry, who is almost as numerous as the other Inhabitants, can hard∣ly subsist in time of Peace.</P>
<P>Besides the Faults which the French have common, with other Nations, as to be too much given to Play, to Women, Debau∣chery, Blasphemies, and Cursings, it cannot be deny'd but that they are Hasty and Cho∣lerick; However you will find amongst 'em very few instances of those secret and awful Revenges that are so often practis'd by some of their Neighbours. As to their Levity, we may in their behalf make use of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth's saying, <HI>That they are Wise with∣out making any shew of it:</HI> For though they are not so Crafty as the Italians, nor so Vain and Proud as the Spaniards, yet do they not want Policy and Cunning. Finally the French are very Religious, and have al∣ways feared their Gods; and whatever Re∣ligion they Embraced, they firmly stick'd to it. The frequent Wars which they have Undertaken or Suffered upon this account, shew the Truth of this Assertion. They are very Respectful to Ladies, and give them large Liberty; neither do they shut them
<PB N="19" REF="16"/> up as the Italians and Spaniards do; whence it comes that they are cordially Beloved and served by their Wives; and that the Visits and Practises of young Women end generally in a happy Wedlock.</P>
<P>The French Tongue for the most part is a Branch of the Latin: The Romans be∣coming Masters of the Country, and intro∣ducing their Laws in it, changed the Speech of the Natural Inhabitants, or by little and lit∣tle made them loose it. If the German Tongue had been there spoken before, or the Bri∣tish, they were at last totally routed, and a kind of corrupted Latin took their place. Now a days each Province has its peculiar manner of Speaking and Dialect; However there is still a difference of Speech betwixt the Provinces on this side the <HI>Loire,</HI> and those beyond it: The first Speak French, and the last Gascon, taking this Word as usually taken at <HI>Paris;</HI> for those of <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Dauphiné, Provence,</HI> and <HI>Guyenne,</HI> the Latin Tongue having left deeper Footsteps of its Residence in those four Provinces than a∣mong the other French, whose Language is purer, especially about <HI>Blois, Orleance,</HI> and <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Riches, Strength, and Govern∣ment of <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> is Rich and Po∣tent by its Situation, by the great num∣bers of its Cities and Inhabitants, and by its Wares of all Sorts, of which there is a great Trade. As to the Riches, the King takes what he pleases in his Taxes, Excise upon Salt, Impositions upon Merchandises that go out and are brought into <HI>France,</HI> be∣sides his Patrimony, whereupon the Kings have lived during a long time. The Reve∣nues of the Kingdom before the Dutch War of 1672, were deem'd to amount to 170000000 Livres, that is, about 15000000 Sterling, but have ever since still diminish'd, partly by the continual Taxes that impove∣rish the People, and partly by the stop which the Wars have put to Trade; but much more by the Persecution of the Protestants, which has made the price of the Lands con∣siderably fall, disturb'd the Traffick of the Realm, and depriv'd it of great Sums of ready Money, which the French Refugees have brought over with 'em into Foreign Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>The French Monarchy strove many Ages before it came to that high Point of Gran∣deur to which it has attained of late. The
<PB N="21" REF="17"/> Weakness of <HI>Charlemaign</HI>'s Successors, and the Incursions of the <HI>Normans,</HI> had reduced it to so narrow Limits, that the French King was hardly Sovereign in <HI>Paris.</HI> The Go∣vernors of the several Counties and Provinces taking hold of the occasion, made their Charges Hereditary; and soon after ren∣der'd themselves Lords of the Countries they Govern'd: So that <HI>France</HI> at that time was rather an <HI>Aristocracy,</HI> or a Confederacy of several Petty-Princes under the French King their Head, as <HI>Germany</HI> now is under the Emperor, then a Monarchy properly so call'd. But the Victories which <HI>Charles</HI> VII got over the English in the Fifteenth Age, during the Wars of the Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> gave him means to Unite to his Crown the large Provinces of <HI>Guyenne</HI> and <HI>Normandy;</HI> together with <HI>Poictou, le Maine,</HI> and <HI>Tourain. Lewis</HI> XI. his Son and Succes∣sor, after the Death of <HI>Charles the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh,</HI> last Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in 1477, usurp'd upon his Sole Heiress <HI>Mary,</HI> Spouse of <HI>Maximi∣lian</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and some part of <HI>Picardy. Charles</HI> VIII. and <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. by their Marriage with <HI>Ann</HI> Daughter to <HI>Francis</HI> II. late Duke of <HI>Bri∣tany,</HI> United that Dutchy to their Crown <HI>Anno</HI> 1514; Then it was that <HI>France</HI> began to look as a mighty Kingdom: So that <HI>Francis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> was a sit Match even for <HI>Charles</HI> V. Emperor and King of
<PB N="22" REF="18"/> <HI>Spain, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> and Lord of all the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> The ex∣tent of the French Kings Jurisdiction was yet increas'd by the Accession of <HI>Bearn</HI> or <HI>Lower Navarre,</HI> of which <HI>Henry</HI> IV. was in Possession when he came to that Crown; And by his Acquisition of the Province of <HI>Bresse,</HI> with the Lands of <HI>Bugey, Valromey,</HI> and the Bailwick of <HI>Gex,</HI> which he Ex∣changed with <HI>Charles Emanuel</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> for some Pretensions on the Marqui∣sate of <HI>Salusses</HI> in 1601. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. his Son Divested the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> of his Dutchy; the Emperor and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> of a good part of <HI>Elzas</HI> and the <HI>Ne∣therlands;</HI> and this present King has not only Conquer'd the County of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and the rest of <HI>Elzas,</HI> but push'd so far his Con∣quests in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> that what now remains in the Hands of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is not able to withstand him any long time.</P>
<P>The Authority of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchs grew stronger and more absolute within their Kingdom, as the Bounds of it were extended without; at least in this latter Age. For in former times, even that mighty Em∣peror <HI>Charlemaign</HI> would do nothing without the Advice of his Barons; no, not so much as establish and endow a Bishoprick: and by their means it was, that his Son, <HI>Lewis the Pious,</HI> was re-inthron'd. The Power of the <HI>French</HI> Lords lasted not only under the Se∣cond

And as these petty Princes were extinguished, their Authority was transferr'd to the States of the several Provinces, under whose hands it remained, till the Civil Wars, under the pretence of Religion, gave a mighty check to it; and the shrewd Policy of the Cardinals <HI>Richelieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine</HI> made it altogether arbitrary.</P>
<P>Now the French Kings pretend that they are Emperors in <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Bodin</HI> and <HI>du Tillet</HI> have endeavoured to prove; That their Authority is Absolute and Sove∣reign, and that as to the Temporal they have no other Superior than God alone, up∣on whom their Crown immediately depends, it not being in the Power of the Prelates of their Kingdom either to excommunicate them, or to publish them to be such. By reason of their Consecration, they are look'd upon to be of the Body of several Cathedral Churches in <HI>France,</HI> where they hold the Prebends. The nominating to Bishopricks, Abbeys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> belongs to them, even by the Pope's Consent, and the <HI>Concordat</HI> made be∣twixt <HI>Francis</HI> I. and <HI>Leo</HI> X. They alone can make Laws in their Kingdom, grant Favors and Pardons, naturalize Strangers, and legi∣timate Bastards. They build Colleges, Uni∣versities, Courts and Companies of Justice, create Offices, and provide for the same.</P>

<P>The Males only, by Salique Law, which the French call the Fundamental of the State, have Right to Succession, and the Crown always is devolved to the next Heir, that is, to the eldest Son of the King, and to the Issues of the eldest Infinitely. This First-born, during his Father's Life, is commonly called the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> by the Donative of <HI>Humbert,</HI> last <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>Viennois,</HI> of his Lands of <HI>Dau∣phiné,</HI> to <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> upon condition, that his eldest Son should be call'd <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and bear quarterly the Arms of <HI>France,</HI> with those of <HI>Viennois.</HI> It was in the year 1343. <HI>Philip</HI> at the in∣treaty of <HI>John</HI> his Son, who reigned after him, gave the Land to his Grandson, who reigned under the Name of <HI>Charles</HI> called <HI>the Wise,</HI> and was the first Son of <HI>France</HI> who bore the Title of <HI>Dauphin.</HI></P>
<P>The Arms of <HI>France</HI> are, <HI>Three Flowers de Luce Or, in a Field Azure.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> VI. reduced them to Three, his Predecessors having had them without number, contrary to the Custom even of the first Kings.</P>
<P>The Consecration of the Kings is solemn∣ly performed at <HI>Rheims,</HI> where they are anointed with Oyl of the Holy Ampoule, kept religiously in the Abbey-Church of St. <HI>Remigius,</HI> whence it is carried under a Canopy by four Knights of the Holy Am∣poule, created by <HI>Clovis</HI> IV. The Royal Ornaments are kept at St. <HI>Denis,</HI> from King
<PB N="25" REF="19"/> St. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s time. The twelve Peers of <HI>France</HI> assist at the Consecration; six whereof are Ecclesiastical, to wit, the Archbishop and Duke of <HI>Rheims,</HI> who consecrates the King; the Bishop and Duke of <HI>Laon,</HI> the Bishop and Duke of <HI>Langres,</HI> the Bishop and Earl of <HI>Bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vais,</HI> the Bishop and Earl of <HI>Chaalons,</HI> the Bishop and Earl of <HI>Noyon.</HI> The Six Lay Peers were formerly, the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Guyonne,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Tolouse,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Champagne:</HI> but these Peers subsisting no more, they are represented by as many French Princes or Lords.</P>
<P>The King's Guards are composed of two strange Nations, <HI>viz. Scots</HI> and <HI>Switzers,</HI> and of his <HI>French</HI> Subjects. The <HI>Scotch</HI> Guard is the first Company of the King's <HI>Guard du Corps.</HI> However, it ought to be observed, that this Name is but a remainder of the an∣cient Alliance between the <HI>Scotch</HI> and the <HI>French:</HI> for since the Reformation, and the Union of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> there has hardly been a <HI>Scotch</HI> Man among these pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended <HI>Scotch</HI> Guards. However, as this Company is the ancientest, so it enjoys the greatest Privileges, for their Captain pre∣cedes the three others, and begins always to ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the first Quarter of the Year; and when the <HI>Guard du Corps</HI> are quartered, they chuse the first Lodging. This Company was at first composed of 100 Gentlemen, or cho∣sen
<PB N="26" REF="20"/> Soldiers; 24 of whom have yet a good Stipend, are Privileged, and have at their Head the first Man at Arms of <HI>France,</HI> who makes the 25th; and these are the Archers of the <HI>Guard du Corps,</HI> who wear <HI>Hoquetons,</HI> or white Cassocks, covered with gilt Silver-Shells, whence they are commonly called <HI>Hoquetons.</HI></P>
<P>The three <HI>French</HI> Companies have been instituted by three several Kings, and wear upon their Arms and Cassocks the Livery, Colours and Devices of the Reigning Kings. Those that are called <HI>Exempts of the Guards,</HI> precede the other Archers; they wear nei∣ther <HI>Hoquetons</HI> nor Cassocks, and command the Guards in the absence of their Officers: They carry a Stick, as a Mark of their Pow∣er and Employment.</P>
<P>The hundred <HI>Switzers</HI> wear the King's Livery, with a Halbert, and are cloathed after their own Country fashion. These four Companies have their Captains, who are all qualified Lords. And besides these, the King has a Regiment of <HI>Switzers,</HI> and another Re∣giment of <HI>French</HI> Guards, with all their Of∣ficers. These make as 'twere a small com∣pleat Army, kept ordinarily with a Company of Musqueteers, or Horse-Guards, whom King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. had instituted, and whose Head he was.</P>
<P>During the Minority of the Kings, which ends so soon as they are 14 years old, a Re∣gent
<PB N="27" REF="20"/> or Protector was provided by the Ge∣neral States of the Kingdom, or by the Court of Parliament of <HI>Paris.</HI> He was com∣monly the King's nearest Kinsman, or the Queen his Mother, as Queen <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> was to King <HI>Charles</HI> IX. Queen <HI>Ma∣ry</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> to King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. But since the Monarchy is become Absolute, the Will of the deceased King has only been regarded. And <HI>Ann</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> Mother to K. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. now Reigning, carried the Regency against the Princes of the Blood, who disputed it with her, though they had the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> on their side, whence ensued a bloody War, in which the Queen and Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> got the better of the Princes. Pa∣tents, Edicts and Arrests are expedited un∣der the Name of the King, with this Title, <HI>By the King, and Queen-Regent.</HI></P>
<P>The Queens of <HI>France</HI> have often been Crowned, whereof History gives several Ex∣amples. They were anointed with another Chrism than that of the Holy Ampoule. Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> was Consecrated and Crowned at St. <HI>Denis</HI> in the year 1610. on the 13th of <HI>May,</HI> by Cardinal <HI>de Joyeuse.</HI> In their Widowhood they have been formerly called <HI>White Queens,</HI> but that has not been used for some Ages.</P>
<P>There is no sharing in the Royal House and Succession, since the Third Stock of the Kings of <HI>France;</HI> so that second Brothers
<PB N="28" REF="21"/> must be contented with a Patrimony in Land, bearing the Title of Dutchy, Peer∣dom, and County. They may have in their House such Officers as the King himself has, <HI>viz.</HI> Chancellor, Secretary, and others, with the Title of <HI>Grandees;</HI> and they are stiled <HI>Your Highness,</HI> as if they were Sovereign Princes. The youngest Sons of the <HI>French</HI> King subscribe only with the proper Name, as well as the King himself: but their Po∣sterity take their Title of the principal Coun∣try that makes up their Portions, as being henceforward accounted a separate Branch of the Princes of the Blood.</P>
<P>The Daughters of the French Kings have not any other Portions than Sums of Money, instead of Lands, which they have had here∣tofore. It is They alone who properly are called <HI>Dames,</HI> or Ladies, in <HI>France.</HI> The Princes of the Blood who become Church-Men keep the Rank belonging to their Birth, and not to the Ecclesiastical Order.</P>
<P>The King's Natural Sons have no share in the Succession either of the Crown or of the Royal Patrimony, but have an Entertainment at the King's Pleasure. They do not bear the Surname of <HI>France,</HI> but that of the Land given them, or of the Branch which they come from; as now the Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> is called of <HI>Orleance,</HI> He or his Predecessors being descended from <HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Orle∣ance,</HI> Brother to King <HI>Charles</HI> VI.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Chief Officers of the Crown and Kingdom.</HEAD>
<P>THE greatest Office of the King's House, is that of Grand Master of his House, before whom, all the Officers that serve therein take the Oaths, and whom they are to obey. There is a Chief Steward of the Household, and a Steward of the House∣hold in Ordinary, and others that serve quarterly, having a Stick in their Hands, set in Silver gilt at both Ends. They precede the Serving Gentlemen, when the Kings Meat goes by.</P>
<P>There is a Grand Provost of <HI>France,</HI> or Provost of the Houshold, which is a very ancient and authorized Office: Justice is exercised, under his Name, by two Lieu∣tenants, the one in a long, and the other in a short Gown, by Serjeants, and by fifty Archers, cloathed in <HI>Hoquetons</HI> or Cassocks of Livery, that follow him, attend the Court,
<PB N="30" REF="22"/> and prosecute the Guilty six Leagues there∣abouts. He also makes the Procedures of criminal Causes betwixt the Officers of the King's Houshold, and others that follow the Court; and when the King is on his March, he sets a Price upon Bread, Wine, Flesh, Hay, Oates, and other Provi∣sions.</P>
<P>The Place of great Chamberlain is also very ancient, honourable and priviledged. He is Superintendant of the King's Cham∣ber, of his Cloathings and Moveables. He lyes at the King's Feet, when he holds his Bed of Justice, or at the General States of the Kingdom, when the Kings used to call them.</P>
<P>There are four Chief Gentlemen of the King's Chamber that serve quarterly, a Ma∣ster of the Wardrobe, a Master of the Ceremonies, a Leader of Ambassadors, who all take the Oaths in the King's Hands.</P>
<P>There was formerly a <HI>Grand Queux,</HI> or a Great Master of the King's Kitchin; but this Charge is now abolished, there having been none since <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Prie,</HI> Lord of <HI>Bu∣zanco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> who died under <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. <HI>An.</HI> 1490. There are yet four Masters <HI>Queux</HI> or Cooks, who serve quarterly in the King's Kitchin.</P>
<P>The Great Master of the Pantry, and the Grand Butler, or Cup-bearer of <HI>France,</HI> do
<PB N="31" REF="22"/> discharge their Duty but in great Solemni∣ties, as at the King's Coronation, and the like; but there are Gentlemen of the King's Table, and Cup-bearers in ordinary, who make the Assay of the Meat and Drink that is presented to the King.</P>
<P>There is a great and little Stable of the King, the Gentlemen of the Little, pass up∣on the King when he is on Horseback. The Great Master of the Horse is constitu∣ted upon them all, and bears the Sword in a Velvet Scabbard, marked with Flower-de-Luces, on great Solemnities, before his Prince.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marshals</HI> of <HI>France</HI> judge of all Military Causes, and have their Lieutenants and Provosts to inform against, and seize upon Vagabonds and Deserters. They or∣dinarily wear a Stick, as a Badge of their Dignity, and when they receive it from the King, they take the Oath of Allegiance to him, in the High Court of Parliament at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Seat of their Jurisdiction is at the Marble-Table in the Palace of that Court, where their Power is very conside∣rable, since the Suppression of the Charge of Lord Constable, upon whom they were formerly depending. However, this Pow∣er is somewhat counterballanced by their great Increase in Number of late years.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor is the Head of all the Courts of Justice, and presides in all
<PB N="32" REF="23"/> the King's Councils in his Absence. Be∣sides, he cannot be destituted, but by Death or Trespass. And therefore the Kings, to keep this great Minister in awe, have a Lord Keeper of the Seals, whom they cause to discharge the Chancellor's Functions, by giving him the Seals; in which Occasion, the Chancellor retains no more but the bare Name of his Office. He has under him the Masters of the Requests, who serve quarterly, judge the Differences between the Officers of the Crown, and pre∣pare such Matters as are to come before the King's Great Council.</P>
<P>This Council is now a Soveraign Court of Justice, whose Sentences are executed throughout the whole Kingdom; it's com∣posed of the Chancellor and eight Masters of Requests. From this Court issue all the Placates, Ordinances and Proclamations. There are also a Council of State, a Coun∣cil of the Exchequer, a Privy-Council, to de∣termine Appeals and Contests about the Ju∣risdiction of Judges, and the Cabinet Coun∣cil, who manages all the Affairs, and is as the Soul of the Realm.</P>
<P>Besides the twelve ancient Peers of <HI>France,</HI> there are near a hundred more created since two or three Centuries; but though they have the Priviledge to sit in the Parlia∣ment at <HI>Paris,</HI> and not to be judged by any other Court, yet they fall short of
<PB N="33" REF="23"/> the Lustre and Power of the first Peers.</P>
<P>The Knights of the Order of St. <HI>Michael</HI> instituted by <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. in 1469, are in no extraordinary Repute; and this Order is now only considered as a step to that of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> instituted by <HI>Henry</HI> III. in 1570, whose Knights are fewer in number and more respected, it being given as a token of special Favour, and to such as are already of St. <HI>Mi∣chael</HI>'s Order, and considered by their Birth or Merits.</P>
<P>I supersede to speak of the Lord Admi∣ral, the Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admi∣rals; Of the Generals, Lieutenant Gene∣rals, Masters de Camp, Collonels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the Masters of the Ordnance, of the Lord Treasurers, Counsellors, and Secretaries of State; of the Ambassadors, Lord Almoner, Under Almoners, Chaplains in Ordinary, and other Officers, either Civil, Military, or Ecclesiastical, who are little or nothing dif∣ferent from the like in <HI>England.</HI> But I must not forget to speak a word of the King's Confessor, who, though he has ori∣ginally no more Power than the Clerk of the Closet here; yet, through the supersti∣tious Condescension of the late Kings, and the shrewd Management of those cunning Politicians, <HI>Cotton, Annat</HI> and <HI>La Chaize,</HI> are become so powerful, as to get into their Hands, the Direction of the most impor∣tant
<PB N="34" REF="24"/> Affairs of the Kingdom, under pre∣tence of Conscience. When the Jesuits were recalled into <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. was advised to take one of these Fathers for his Confessor, who should be as an Hostage for the Fidelity of the whole Club. But this very Caution proved his Ruine, for Fa∣ther <HI>Cotton,</HI> whom he pitched upon, having first seduced his Queen, laid his Plot so well with <HI>Spain</HI> and his Fellow-Jesuits, that the King was murthered by <HI>Ravaillac:</HI> And that <HI>Henry</HI>'s Ghostly Father and Queen had a Hand in this horrid Business, can hardly be doubted, after the Insinuations the sincere <HI>Mezeray</HI> gives of it.</P>
<P>There are two Charges in <HI>France,</HI> the like I don't know that we have in <HI>England,</HI> or at least they are not here in such a Con∣sideration as in that Kingdom. The Offi∣cers who discharge them, are always Counts, or Dukes, or Princes of the Blood, and are called the <HI>Great Huntsman,</HI> and the <HI>Great Falconer</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> They have large Ap∣pointments, Gifts and Profits, and several Officers under them, whose Places are at their Disposal. The <HI>Captain General of the Hunting-Nets,</HI> and the <HI>Great Wolf-Hunter,</HI> keep likewise an honourable Rank, and all four are sworn by the King himself.</P>
<P>I shall finish this Chapter with mention∣ing the Way of administring Justice in <HI>France.</HI> Suits are for the most part com∣menced
<PB N="35" REF="24"/> before the ordinary Judges of the Place, which are called <HI>Royal,</HI> or <HI>Seigneurial,</HI> according as the Town or Village depends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmediately upon the King, or a private Lord, except in some particular Cases, or when one of the Parties concerned is ex∣empted from their Jurisdiction. Thence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are brought before the Baylives or Se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eschals, who are Chief Justices of a certain Precinct, called <HI>Baylwick, Vriguory, Provost∣ship,</HI> or <HI>Seneshalship.</HI> These Baylives are Noble Men, who bear a Sword instead of a Gown, and seldom discharge their Office themselves, but have two Lieutenants un∣der them, one for Civil, and the other for Criminal Causes.</P>
<P>The last, and Supream Jurisdiction, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he High Court of Parliament, each of which is composed of ten, twelve, or fifteen Presidents, and well near eighty or an hun∣dred Counsellors. The Power of this Court, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s yet very great, because of the many No∣ble and Priviledged Men, whose Causes im∣mediately resort to it. But it was much greater in times past, especially that of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> which was in some manner a standing Assembly of the General States: For no <HI>Edict</HI> or Proclamation of the King had the Force of a Law before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enteriné,</HI> or ratify'd by them; and they might reject such as were not, in their Judgments, fit for the Publick Good. A
<PB N="36" REF="25"/> Boldness of which History furnisheth us with several Examples, even under the most powerful and respected Princes, as <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. <HI>Francis</HI> I. and <HI>Henry</HI> IV. But the late Ministers, <HI>Richelieu, Mazarin, Col∣bert</HI> and <HI>Louvois,</HI> have so far undermined the Authority of these Courts, that they not only dare not reject any of the King's E∣dicts, but dare not so much as make use of the Word <HI>Enteriné,</HI> their Style being now <HI>Lû &amp; verifié en Parlement:</HI> That is, <HI>Read and acknowledged for a true Writing, or Or∣der of the King.</HI> The Intendants are the Men, whom the Promoters of Arbitrary Power have made a special use of to bring down the Power of Parliaments. They are a kind of Overseers, whom the French Kings began to send into the several Provin∣ces of their Dominions fifty or sixty years ago, and who, under pretence of setling the King's Revenues, reconciling Differences about it, or seeing Justice well done, have considera∣bly encroached upon the Jurisdiction of Par∣liaments, without that the Complaints of the last were ever regarded at Court. The preposterous Zeal of these Magistrates a∣gainst the Reformed, was none of the least Causes of their Decay; for as often as any Suit, wherein both Churches seemed to be concerned, came before them, we were sure to get an <HI>Arrêt de Partage;</HI> or that the Pro∣testant President and Counsellors would
<PB N="37" REF="25"/> give their Voice in favour of the Defenders, whereas the Roman Catholicks would de∣cide for the Plaintiffs, how ill grounded soe∣ver their Actions might be. This of course brought the Decision of the Matter before the King's Council; so that our Reformed seeing that no Justice was to be hoped from the Parliament, made an Interest to remove the Cause before the King's Council, that they might avoid expences, which many other imitated, not without the secret Sup∣port of the Court.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Religion of the French.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader must not here expect an Account of the <HI>Bardes</HI> and <HI>Druides,</HI> or of the Idolatrous Worship of the ancient <HI>Gauls;</HI> neither am I minded to assert, or con∣fute what has been said concerning St. <HI>De∣nis,</HI> the <HI>Areopagite,</HI> being Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> or St. <HI>Martial,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Limoges,</HI> and both Apostles of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> about the Year 70. By whomsoever the Christian Religion has been first preached in <HI>France,</HI> sure it is, that it was early enough, since in the middle of the second Century, there were two con∣spicuous Churches at <HI>Lyons</HI> and <HI>Vienne,</HI> who endured a long and bloody Perse∣cution,
<PB N="38" REF="26"/> under the Empire of <HI>Marc. Aurele. An.</HI> 176. By what Means and Degrees Popery corrupted Christianity, is not a My∣stery in this Protestant Kingdom; but I have some Observations to make upon the Progress and present State of that Supersti∣tious Worship in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It's well known that Superstition be∣gan to creep into the Church by the over∣great Honour the Faithful rendered to those Christian Heroes, the Martyrs, who, con∣trary to the Heathen, that got a Name by their being troublesome to others, signaliz∣ed themselves by their own Sufferings. And with great reason were they so much reve∣renced, since the Pagan Antiquity, which mentions so many <HI>Hercules,</HI> can hardly sup∣ply us with an <HI>Anaxarchus.</HI> While these couragious Athletes lay in Prison, Sinners were released of their Penances upon their Intercession; after their Death, their Tombs were the Gathering-place of the Faithful, and when God had given Peace to his Church, Temples were built upon, or near their Graves, and called after their Names. And as the Vulgar doth not know how to keep the golden middle Path, hates or loves, despises or praises to excess; So this due and lawful Remembrance soon degenerated into an Idolatrous Worship. Perhaps at the beginning it had been easie to Clergy-Men to put a Stop to that Superstition; but the
<PB N="39" REF="26"/> Generality found, it seems, their Reckon∣ing by it, and pious Men durst not oppose the Current. However the <HI>Gauls</HI> had the Honour to produce one <HI>Jovinian,</HI> a Monk of <HI>Milan,</HI> who endured a long Persecution for openly disproving the creeping Practices of Coelibacy, Vows, and the Veneration of Reliques, in the time of St. <HI>Ambrose.</HI> But a greater Man than <HI>Jovinian</HI> whom neither <HI>Italians</HI> nor <HI>Spaniards</HI> can challenge, is <HI>Vi∣gilantius;</HI> for he was born at <HI>Calaguri,</HI> a small Borough near <HI>Cominges</HI> in <HI>Gascony.</HI> True it is, that St. <HI>Jerom</HI> disputed against him with much Violence; but the Learned know, that the Conduct of this Father is not so much commended as his Science; and not∣withstanding his Out-crys, <HI>Vigilantius</HI> qui∣etly died in the Communion of the Church, and left a great many Disciples, who seem to have been the Fore-fathers of the <HI>Albi∣genses;</HI> as those of <HI>Jovinian</HI> maintained the Truth in the Churches of <HI>Italy,</HI> till <HI>Claudius,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Turin</HI> arose, and was succeeded by the <HI>Vaudois.</HI></P>
<P>The second Step of Superstition, was the Worship of Images, which when the Em∣perors of the <HI>East</HI> could no longer oppose, God raised <HI>Charlemaign</HI> in the <HI>West,</HI> who caus'd it to be condemned, together with the second Council of <HI>Nice;</HI> in another held at <HI>Francfort, Ann.</HI> 794. At the same time <HI>Agobard,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Lyons,</HI> and
<PB N="40" REF="27"/> <HI>Claudius</HI> of <HI>Turin,</HI> preach'd and wrote again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> these Idolatrous Practices; which prevail'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at last, during the Weakness and Division of <HI>Charlemaign</HI>'s House and Successors.</P>
<P>Transubstantiation was a casual Off¦spring of Image-Worship; for when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Orthodox told the <HI>Iconolatre</HI>'s that God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Son had left us but an Image of himself namely, the Holy Sacrament, which not∣withstanding he never commanded to a∣dore; the last, after many Subterfuges, final∣ly bethought themselves of this Answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> That the consecrated Bread and Wine were not a simple Image of our Lord, but his true Body and Blood. Against this strange Doctrine, <HI>Bertram,</HI> or <HI>Ratramn,</HI> Priest and Monk of <HI>Corby</HI> in <HI>Picardy,</HI> composed a Book about the Year 850. and a little after, <HI>John Scot Erigeene,</HI> Professor of Divinity in the University of <HI>Paris,</HI> wrote of the same Matter, both by Order of <HI>Charles</HI> the Bald, Emperor. By the Opposition of these great Men, this monstrous Tenet was somewhat suppressed; but as it lifted up its Head a∣gain, after their Death, <HI>Berengarius,</HI> Arch-Deacon of <HI>Angers,</HI> arose for the Truth, in 1035; was a long time maintained by several French Bishops, against the Power and Persecution of the Popes, and dy'd in the Communion of the Church <HI>Ann.</HI> 1088, not without solemnly recalling the nonsensical Confession which the Popes <HI>Ni∣colas</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="27"/> II. and <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. had forced upon him.</P>
<P>After <HI>Berengarius,</HI> the Assertors of the Truth had more dreadful Storms to go through; however, <HI>France</HI> was never want∣ing such Christian Heroes. Some rejected all the Popish Errors, as <HI>Peter de Bruys,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Tolose,</HI> the <HI>Waldenses</HI> and <HI>Albigen∣ses.</HI> Some confuted Transubstantiation, as <HI>John</HI> Dr. of <HI>Paris,</HI> known under the Name of <HI>Joannes de Parisiis;</HI> others bewailed the Corruption of the Church, as <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Clemangis;</HI> others inveighed against the Monks, their Luxury and Covetousness, especially <HI>William</HI> of St. <HI>Amour.</HI> As to those that opposed the Tyranny and Usurpations of the Popes, it would be too tedious to e∣numerate them, and I refer my Reader to the Learned <HI>Richer</HI> and <HI>Du Pin.

<P>The French Soyl being so well prepared to receive the Seed of the Gospel, 'tis not to be wondered at, if the Disciples of <HI>Luther,</HI> and the Writings of <HI>Calvin</HI> caused such a Harvest in that Kingdom; one ought ra∣ther to be surpriz'd that it was not fruit∣ful every where, and that, against all Ap∣pearance, in less than 200 Years, the Ro∣man Tare has outwardly covered the whole Realm again.

But when God had given them a Protestant King, who conquered a good part of his Realm with the Dint of his Sword; when so many of the Bishops and Nobility resorted to <HI>Henry</HI> IV: 'tis a won∣der that his Presbyterian Ministers never thought of submitting to the Prelates, pro∣vided the Prelates would submit to the Truth.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I. LORRAIN,</HI> the Three Bishopricks, and the Dutchy of <HI>BAR.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Province is called thus from <HI>Lothaire,</HI> Grand-Son of <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Meek,</HI> Emperour and King of <HI>France,</HI> who was Soveraign thereof, when it was far greater, and bore the Name of Kingdom.
<PB N="48" REF="31"/> The whole Dutchy belongs now to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King of <HI>France,</HI> who has usurped the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦est part of it upon <HI>Charles</HI> III. the true S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦veraign, and forced him to make over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Right to him.

The Inhabitants are Warlike, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Country for the most part covered wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Woods and Forests, yet well stock'd wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Corn, Vines and Minerals; nor does it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleasant Rivers, and good Waters. Its Town are well built, strong and rich.</P>
<P><HI>NANCY</HI> the Capital of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was the or¦dinary Residence of the Dukes, whose Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was crouded with great Numbers of Nobilit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Gentry.

<PB N="49" REF="31"/> is there also. The <HI>Arsenal</HI> was well pro∣vided with all Necessaries, and its Fortificati∣ons seemed to render it impregnable, before the French took it. There is a Bog or fenny Place pretty nigh the Town, in the midst of which, is a Cross of Stone, with an Inscription in French, that marks the Defeat of the <HI>Burgun∣dians</HI> under <HI>Charles</HI> the Rash, their last Duke, <HI>An.</HI> 1477. The Town is situated about an hundred Steps from the <HI>Meurte,</HI> which dis∣charges it self into the <HI>Moselle,</HI> four or five Miles from thence. <HI>Nancy</HI> is divided into Old and New Town; the Old has the Pala∣ce of the Dukes, but the New is greater, and better fortified. The French destroy'd its Fortifications in 1664, and afterwards repaired them. There is a Chamber of Ac∣counts, and a Seneshalship.</P>
<P>This Province has also <HI>Bar le Duc,</HI> Capi∣tal of the Dutchy of that Name: It was built by <HI>Frederick,</HI> Duke of the <HI>Mozellane Lorrain,</HI> in 951, and fortified with a strong Castle, to prevent the Incursions of the <HI>Champenois.</HI> There were several other strong Places, amongst the rest, <HI>Marsal</HI> and <HI>Moyen∣vic,</HI> whose Fortifications the French have destroyed, as well as the Castle of <HI>Bar le Duc.</HI> Near <HI>Moyenvic</HI> are commodious Salt-Pits.</P>
<P>I must not forget the three Bishopricks taken from <HI>Charles</HI> V. in 1552. <HI>viz. Toul, Mets</HI> and <HI>Verdun,</HI> because they are included in this Province, and are nearly ty'd to it,
<PB N="50" REF="32"/> especially in what concerns Spiritual Juris∣diction, though as to the Civil, they make a separate Government.</P>
<P><HI>Toul, Tullum Leucorum,</HI> is a Town well built, situated upon the <HI>Mosell,</HI> twelve Miles from <HI>Nancy.</HI> It's pretty big, and boasts of St. <HI>Bernard</HI>'s Tomb, over which is a Crown extraordinary well worked; its Diocess is pretty large.</P>
<P><HI>Verdun, Verodunum,</HI> a very pleasant City, situated in a fruitful and good Soil on the River <HI>Meuse,</HI> Twenty six Miles from <HI>Mets,</HI> Its Bishops take the Title of Counts of <HI>Ver∣dun,</HI> and Princes of the Holy Empire. It has a strong Citadel and Baylwick, and is renowned for its Aniseed.</P>
<P><HI>Mets</HI> is also a very pleasant Town, both for its Houses, its Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> a true Master-piece of Architecture, and the River <HI>Moselle</HI> and <HI>Seille</HI> that wash it. It is a very ancient City, since <HI>Ce∣sar, Plinius, Tacite</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> mention it under the Name of <HI>Divodurum Mediomatri∣cum,</HI> and speak of it as the chief Town of that Country, and of the People called <HI>Medio∣matrices,</HI> now <HI>Les habitans du pais Messin.</HI> In process of time, it became still more and more Famous; and under the French Kings of the first Race, was Capital of the Kingdom of <HI>Austrasia,</HI> called also the King∣dom of <HI>Mets;</HI> since <HI>Theodoric,</HI> Son to <HI>Clovis</HI> the Great, had chosen it for the Seat of his
<PB N="51" REF="32"/> Empire. In the Decay of <HI>Charlemaign</HI>'s House, <HI>Mets</HI> erected it self into a free Im∣perial Town, under the Government of its own Magistrates, who had Power of Life and Death, and of Coining of Money. And so jealous they were of their Liberty, that <HI>Charles</HI> VII. King of <HI>France,</HI> besieging them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n 1444, on the behalf of <HI>Renatus</HI> Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> they rather chose to see their Country wasted during seven Months, and to redeem themselves with 300000 Livres, than to loose their Liberty. Thus they kept it till the Year 1552, that their City was taken by the Lord of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> High Constable of <HI>France.</HI> In the Month of <HI>October,</HI> of the same Year, <HI>Charles</HI> V. be∣sieged it in vain, and as it was the last Un∣dertaking of this Emperour, it gave occasi∣on to this Verse, alluding to the modern Name of this Town in Latin, <HI>Metae.</HI></P>
<Q>Siste viam Metis, haec tibi meta datur.</Q>
<P>There is seen in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Church, a Ves∣sel of Red Porphyry, ten Foot long, and all of a piece, which serves to keep their Holy Water in. This great Town has no Sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urbs, and is all surrounded with a strong Rampier, and deep and wide Ditches, that can be filled at pleasure, only opening a Sluce to let in the <HI>Moselle:</HI> Yet for its great∣er Strength, a Cittadel with four Bastions,
<PB N="52" REF="33"/> have been built there of late. The People are well bred, Civil and Numerous, and drive a great Trade into <HI>Germany.</HI> The Circumference of the Town is pretty big; its Bishop entitles himself Prince of the Em∣pire, and has four Arch-Deacons under him, with 623 Parishes.</P>
<P>In 1633, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. established there a Parliament, which the Commissioners of the Emperour opposed, saying, <HI>That the French King was only Protector of the three Bishopricks, and not absolute Sovereign thereof; and conse∣quently, that he might not deprive the Inhabi∣tants of their ancient Laws, and the Right they had to bring their Appeals before the Im∣perial Chamber at</HI> Spire. These Complaints lasted to the Peace of <HI>Munster,</HI> in which the three Bishopricks and <HI>Moyenvic</HI> were yield∣ed unconditionally and for ever to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> save only the Right of Me∣tropolitan to the Archbishop of <HI>Triers.</HI></P>
<P>This Parliament, as it was the last, so it was at first the least considerable next to that of <HI>Pau,</HI> the three Bishopricks only resorting to it. But since the Conquest of <HI>Lorrain, Luxemburg,</HI> and adjacent Coun∣tries, its Jurisdiction is mightily inlarged. It made a great Noise some time after the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> about the Year 1680 when the French King erected there a Chamber of Dependencies, whose Judges summoned the Spanish Subjects to come and
<PB N="53" REF="33"/> swear Allegiance to the French King, under pretence that they were depending upon some of his new Conquests. By this Shrewdness, he got more Lands during the Peace, than he had done in the War.</P>
<P>The Dukedom of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> is under the Governour of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> but I supersede to make a particular Description of it, be∣cause the Low-Countries deserve a Treatise by it self. I shall only observe, that there is a Soveraign Council in the Capital, whereunto the whole Province resorts.</P>
<P>At a League's distance from the Town, is a Village called <HI>Jovy,</HI> where are still to be seen some Remains of an Aqueduct, built by the Romans, with Arches of a fine white Stone, cut in Form of Bricks, and above Sixty Foot high.</P>
<P>Besides this, there is another considerable Place near <HI>Nancy,</HI> called St. <HI>Nicolas,</HI> that should deserve rather to be called one of the greatest Towns of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> for the Number of its Inhabitants, and considerable Traffick, than a simple Borough, if it were walled in. The other most considerable Places near the Capital, are <HI>Fruart,</HI> which is but a League off it; <HI>Ormes, Bayon, Pont a Mousson,</HI> famous for its University, found∣ed by <HI>Charles,</HI> Cardinal of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> on be∣half of the Jesuits; <HI>An.</HI> 1573, and very pleasant by reason of its fruitful Soil, and of the <HI>Mosell,</HI> which runs through the mid∣dle
<PB N="54" REF="34"/> of the Town, and is passed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bridge; whence, and from a neighbouring Mountain, called <HI>Mousson,</HI> is derived th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Name of <HI>Pont à Mousson.</HI> Then <HI>Veze¦lize, Roziere, Blancmont, Gerbevillier, Charmes Chastenoy, Moranges, Vaucouleur,</HI> the Birth-place of <HI>Jane d' Arc,</HI> called the Virgin, or Mai∣den of <HI>Orleans, Mexan-sous-Bresse, Dompaire Deneure, Hoden, Chasteau-Rambervillier, Raon Bellemont, Neuf-chastel, Magstat, Marchain∣ville, Espinal Bruyeres, Darney, Ormont, Val∣derfing, Beauzains, Vaigni, Estraye, Esti∣val, Luneville, Fauquemont, Sare-Louïs,</HI> a new Fortress, with a Presidial, <HI>Vandervange,</HI> the Seat of a Baylwick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

The Abbess is not suffered to leave the Habit, but all the Nuns can go out and marry if they please. <HI>La Mothe</HI> was a small Town on the Frontiers of <HI>Champaign;</HI> but being built on a steep Rock, washed by a Brook, it was accounted impregnable, before the Ma∣shal <HI>de la Force</HI> took it, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1634, for the French King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. who caused it afterwards to be demolished. Its Lord∣ships, are <HI>Marsal, Remereville,</HI> S. <HI>Ballemont, Ramberville, Homburg, Mariemont</HI> and <HI>San∣dacourt.
<PB N="55" REF="34"/> Phalzburg</HI> has the Title of Princi∣pality: It is situated at the Foot of the Mountains, on the Frontiers of <HI>Elzas,</HI> se∣ven or eight Leagues from <HI>Strasburg;</HI> but is not so considerable as it was formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Lorrain</HI> also comprehends the Dutchy of <HI>Bar,</HI> which reaches to <HI>Neuf Chastel,</HI> or <HI>New-Castle,</HI> whereof the principal Town is <HI>Bar le Duc</HI> the less considerable, S. <HI>Mihel,</HI> a strong Town, whose Inhabitants made bold to rebel against King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. in behalf of their Duke <HI>Charles</HI> III. for which, some of them were sent to the Gallies, after the Year 1633.

Thence springs the <HI>Mo∣sell,</HI> near a Village called <HI>Bussans,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Franche-County</HI> and <HI>Elzas,</HI> takes its Course towards <HI>Remiremont,</HI> where it receives several Brooks; amongst others, the <HI>Vologne,</HI> or <HI>Voloye,</HI> increased with the <HI>Nany</HI> at a Village called <HI>Chamery;</HI> then it goes down to <HI>Espinal, Chastel, Charmes, Bay∣on</HI> and <HI>Chaligny,</HI> where the <HI>Modon,</HI> with the Waters of the <HI>Illon, Vezelize,</HI> &amp;c. discharges it self into it. Afterwards, it washes <HI>Toul</HI> and <HI>Pont à Mousson,</HI> and between these two Ci∣ties, receives the <HI>Meurte,</HI> which comes also
<PB N="56" REF="35"/> from the Mountains of <HI>Vauge,</HI> goes by <HI>S. Dioy, Raon, Luneville, Roziere, S. Nicolas.</HI> Then being Increased with several other Rivers, washes <HI>Nancy,</HI> and looses it self into the <HI>Mosell,</HI> near the Castle of <HI>Condé.</HI> As to the <HI>Mosell,</HI> it pursues its Course towards <HI>Mets,</HI> where it receives the <HI>Seille,</HI> that seems to issue from a Lake near <HI>Marsal;</HI> then goes down to <HI>Thionville</HI> and <HI>Triers.</HI> There it is increased with the <HI>Sare,</HI> that springs like∣wise from the Mountains <HI>Vauge,</HI> near <HI>Salms,</HI> and washes several Places, to which it gives its Name, as <HI>Sarburg, Saralbe, Sargomine,</HI> and <HI>Sarpruch.</HI> Finally, having made several Windings and Turnings, and received some other Rivers, it goes to <HI>Coblentz,</HI> and mixes there with the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The <HI>Saone</HI> takes its Source on the other side of these Mountains, which had given the thoughts of digging a Channel to joyn these two Rivers, that there might be a Communication between the Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The Project was begun under the Emperor <HI>Nero,</HI> but was not followed. In fine, this Dutchy comprehending the <HI>Barrois,</HI> is four Days Jour∣ney, that is, about forty Leagues in length from <HI>Stenay</HI> to <HI>Darnay,</HI> and near so many in breadth from <HI>Bar le Duc</HI> to <HI>Biche;</HI> the whole abounding in Wheat, Wine, and all other Ne∣cessaries for Man's Sustenance; as in Beasts or Cattle of all Kinds, Fish in their Rivers and Ponds, Baths that are much esteemed, and
<PB N="57" REF="35"/> Salt-pits that are none of the worst. It's also rich in Mines of Silver, Brass, Iron, Tin and Lead; and at the Foot of the Mountains of <HI>Vauge,</HI> are found Azure-Stones, with some Pearls, and the best Stuff in the World to make Looking-glasses of; besides, <HI>Cassidonies</HI> of such considerable big∣ness, that Drinking-Cups are made of them. Neither <HI>Turkey,</HI> nor the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> can furnish better Horses than <HI>Lorrain,</HI> nor is there better fresh Water-Fish in the World than its Trouts, Salmons, Pearches, Carps and Tenches are. The Carps in a Lake that is fourteen Leagues in circuit, are some of them three or four foot long.</P>
<P>As for the Manners and Customs of the Inhabitants, they have been observed to be a Mixture of the German and French. The People will drink hard, are free and open, and not as cunning or ingenious as other Nations: Yet the Gentry, as they are stout and brave, so do they likewise pretend to Wit and good Breeding, some taking to the German Fashion, but a great part living af∣ter the French. Under their Dukes, as they were not overburthened with Taxes, and lived pretty rich and easie, so they denied themselves no Pleasures or Diversions, and Feasts, Plays, Balls, Musick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were very frequent, and in great request amongst them. However the Country is still very good and pleasant; for Men of Business may imploy

<P>I Put here this Principality, because it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in my way from <HI>Lorrain</HI> to <HI>Champaign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> though it belongs now to this last Govern∣ment. But before I enter into it, I must describe the famous Forest of <HI>Ardenne. Ar∣duenna Sylva,</HI> apparently so called, because 'tis so rugged and craggy, and the Ways in some places so narrow, that Carters go a∣long winding a Horn, to hinder that others should meet with them. In <HI>Cesar</HI>'s time, it reached from <HI>Rheims</HI> in <HI>Champain</HI> to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and thence to <HI>Tournay</HI> on the <HI>Scheld;</HI> so that it was extended an hundred and thirty Miles in length, fifty or sixty in breadth in some places, and covered part of <HI>Champaign</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI> of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> and the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege,</HI> and of the Counties of <HI>Namur, Haynaut</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> which are now filled with so many fair Cities. Now this Forest has not above forty Miles in length from <HI>Thionville</HI> on the <HI>Mosell,</HI> in the
<PB N="59" REF="36"/> Dutchy of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> to <HI>Donchery</HI> and <HI>Se∣dan.</HI> The Emperours <HI>Charlemaign</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Meek</HI> took a Delight in Hunting there, e∣specially in Autumn, that they made a Royal Sport of Gaming, with great Prepa∣rations. <HI>Sigebert,</HI> King of <HI>Austrasia,</HI> had built two Abbies in the midst of it, which are now in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>This Principality, which is but four Leagues in square, is included between <HI>Champaign, Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Luxemburg.</HI> It be∣long'd formerly to the famous Family of the Dukes of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> and Viscounts of <HI>Tu∣rene,</HI> well known for their many and great Exploits, untill <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. or rather his ambitious Minister, Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> made bold to deprive them of it, in the Year 1642. It's true, they have had some Lands in exchange, but they are not to be compared to these, either for Profit or Honour, were it but for the Title of Soveraignty. This Country, though it is covered with Woods, as I have hinted, does not want, however, a Competency of Corn, which makes the Abode both agreeable and cheap. The chief Town is <HI>Sedan,</HI> whose Situation is pleasant enough, because the <HI>Mosell</HI> runs by it, though of one side it has a Mountain; both these, with its good Castle, render it impregnable.

<P>The <HI>Isle of France,</HI> in the stricter Sense, is also called <HI>Parisis</HI> by some, and has the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Towns of St. <HI>Denis, Montmorency</HI> and <HI>Dammartin;</HI> but consider∣ed as a Government, it has <HI>Picardy</HI> on the North, <HI>Champaign</HI> and <HI>Brie</HI> on the West, the <HI>Orleanois</HI> on the South, and <HI>Normandy</HI> on the West. The Country brings forth excellent Wheat, Wine indifferent good,

<P><HI>PARIS,</HI> Capital of the Isle and Kingdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>France,</HI> is one of the biggest, riches<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and most Beautiful Cities in Europe. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Houses very high, well built, and as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inhabited: Its Streets and Places large an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> regular, its Churches magnificent, its Pala¦ces, and especially the <HI>Louvre,</HI> great an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sumptuous; its Colledges, Universities Bridges, Hospitals, Abbies, Churches an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monasteries worthy to be seen.</P>
<P>There are Forty four Parishes: Its Ca∣thedral <HI>Notre-Dame,</HI> or Our Lady's Church though it be built upon Piles, is extraordi∣nary high, Sixty Paces wide, and an Hun∣dred seventy four long, and is said to in∣clude Forty five small Chappels. The Fron∣tisepiece has the Figures of the Thirty eight Kings that have reigned between <HI>Childebert</HI> and <HI>Philip Auguste,</HI> and the two Towers that serve as Belfreys, are Three hundred eighty nine Steps high, and have Eight great Bells, whereof the biggest re∣quires Twenty Men to ring it, and is heard Seven or Eight Leagues of. There is a Crucifix over the greatest Door of the Quire, all of one piece, with the Feet form∣ing an <HI>Arch,</HI> that is a Masterpiece in that Kind. The Quire, the Chappel and Body of the Church, are adorned with rich
<PB N="81" REF="47"/> Paintings, fine gilt Cornishes, and other Or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aments.</P>
<P>It has Eight Dignitaries, a Dean, a Singer, Three Arch-Deacons, an Under-Singer, a Chancellor, and a Penitentiary. Sixty nine Canons, six Grand Vicars, Two Rectors of St. <HI>John the Round,</HI> Two Vicars of St. <HI>Aig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an,</HI> Twelve Singing Boys, besides the Clerks or <HI>Matines</HI> of Morning-Service, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Hundred and forty Chapplains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sainte-Chapelle,</HI> or Holy Chappel, is a∣nother fine Building: It consists of two Chap∣pels, both supported by such small Pillars, that it's thought very strange they can bear such a great weight as their Disposition and Order makes them do. The Canons here have the same Priviledges with them of our Lady, and depend immediately on the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> but the French King has the Nomination of them all. It's called <HI>Sainte Chapelle,</HI> by reason of the great Number of Reliques laid up therein; amongst the rest, they make a Shew of part of our Saviour's Crown of Thorns, some of the Nails that stuck him to the Cross, with some part of the Wood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Near this is the Place that <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair built to keep Parliaments in. This Place is considerable for its Bigness and Beauty, but more for its great Hall for Hearing, or Audiences, very beautiful and rich. That of the Attorneys, is very spacious, and was formerly adorned with
<PB N="82" REF="48"/> all the Kings Statues done to the Life, be¦sides the Marble-Table, estemed one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most curious Pieces of all Europe; its Gal¦leries and Avenues well stock'd with ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shops, furnished with all manner of Mer∣chandize.</P>
<P>Monasteries are here almost numberless The most considerable are these that fol∣low, 1. That of the Templers, inclosed wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a good Wall, has a great square Tower, a fine Church with curious Chappels, and Lodgings for a King; a Place so considera∣ble, that part of the Town still retains the Name of <HI>Marets-du-Temple,</HI> though this ancient Order was abolished by Pope <HI>Cle∣ment</HI> V. under <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair, in 1309. The Abby of St. <HI>Germain</HI> deserves the se∣cond Place, great in all things, and Head of its Suburb, where the Abbots Officers exercise Justice. 3. The Convent of the Canon Regulars of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> in the Sub∣urbs of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> built by <HI>Lewis</HI> the Burly. Those of <HI>Sainte Geneniefue,</HI> Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustins, Celestins, Cartu∣sians, Feuillans, Jesuits, <HI>Les Filles-de-dieu, Val de grace;</HI> especially these last are curious Buildings. The Church-Yard of St. <HI>John</HI> in <HI>Greve,</HI> and of St. <HI>Innocents,</HI> are the most remarkable of this Kind. Bodies are quite consumed in the last in the space of eight days.</P>
<PB N="83" REF="48"/>
<P>The Parish Churches are not less magni∣ficent, St. <HI>Eustache</HI> has at least 35 or 40000 Communicants. To St. <HI>Nicholas des Champs,</HI> or in the Fields, St. <HI>James,</HI> St. <HI>Sulpice,</HI> and St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> do likewise resort a great num∣ber of People.</P>
<P>Its Colledges are also very fair, especial∣ly those of <HI>Du Plessis, Sorbonne,</HI> and of <HI>Master Gervais,</HI> the First founded in 1322, and the Second in 1870. Nor is <HI>Clairmont,</HI> the Jesuits Colledge less considerable, either for its Building, or the Number and Quality of Students. It's also well worth while to visit St. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Church, built by these Fathers in St. <HI>Antony</HI>'s-<HI>Street.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sorbonne</HI> is but the first House, or Col∣ledge of Divinity at <HI>Paris,</HI> though this Name be sometimes given to the whole U∣niversity, founded by <HI>Charlemaign</HI> about the Year 791; but since increased and made more commendable by <HI>Lewis</HI> VII. and <HI>Phi∣lip August.</HI> It is divided into four Facul∣ties, Divinity, Law, Physick, and Arts. This last is the most ancient, and composed of four Nations, <HI>French, Picards, Normans</HI> and <HI>Germans:</HI> Out of their Body is taken the Head of the University, called <HI>Rector,</HI> who, in publick Solemnities, immediately follows the Princes of the Blood, and at the King's Burial, walks by the Archbishop's Side. His Robe of Ceremony is a Purple
<PB N="84" REF="49"/> Gown, tyed up with a Girdle that has go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦den Hangings, and an old fashioned Purse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which denotes his Priority and Power ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the Pursers of the University. He als<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wears a short Purple Mantle, lined with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ermine-Skin, and has a Tribunal compose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the three Deans in Divinity, Law and Physick, and of the four Attor¦neys of the four Nations. A new <HI>Rect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> may be elected every three Months, but h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that is in Office is often continued, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such an Authority upon all the Faculties that he may cause all publick Acts to cease<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and four times in the year, at his Processio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day, actually forbids all Preachers to as∣cend the Pulpit.</P>
<P>As to the House of <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> it's very anci∣ent, being founded by <HI>Robert Sorbonn,</HI> St. <HI>Lew∣is</HI>'s Almoner, in 1252, or 1253. This Col∣ledge is one of the most rigorous of Eu∣rope, none being admitted to the Degree of Batchelor, unless he studies three years in Divinity in it; after he has been received Master of Arts, and sustains nine or ten publick <HI>Theses.</HI> Neither is the Degree of Doctor given to any, without going through the <HI>Sorbonique Act,</HI> that holds from Sun-rise to Sun-set, the Candidate answering all that time to such as come to dispute against him. The Dean of the Faculty is commit∣ted to oversee these <HI>Theses,</HI> and each Doctor that Disputes is to have a Crown from the
<PB N="85" REF="49"/> Answerer, who must satisfie all their Ar∣guments without any body's Help; so that he ought to be an able Scholar, and have a strong Purse too. Those that are admit∣ted that way, take the Title of <HI>Doctors of the House and Society of</HI> Sorbonne; but the others, that only of Divinity's Doctor in the Faculty of <HI>Paris.</HI> As for the Building, it's enough to observe, that Cardinal <HI>Riche∣lieu</HI> has taken care to make it one of the most sumptuous of <HI>Paris,</HI> in enriched it with vast Revenues, and a good Library.</P>
<P>The second House after <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> is that of <HI>Navarre,</HI> founded by <HI>Jane,</HI> Queen of <HI>Na∣varre,</HI> Soveraign Countess of <HI>Champaign,</HI> and Wife to <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair, King of <HI>France.</HI> Humane Learning, Philosophy and Divini∣ty are taught in this House, which has the Priviledge of making Doctors as well as <HI>Sorbonne.</HI></P>
<P>There are a great many other considera∣ble Colledges, founded by Kings, Princes, Popes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I pass by, to speak of that called of <HI>The Four Nations,</HI> founded by Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> and built over against the <HI>Louvre.</HI> His Design in this sumptuous Building is said to have been to encourage Strangers to come to this Capital of the Kingdom, to make them have an Esteem and Love for <HI>France,</HI> use themselves to its Ways, and learn its Fashions. Of these four Nations are kept Sixty Gentlemen,
<PB N="86" REF="50"/> Fifteen from <HI>Pignerol,</HI> for <HI>Italy;</HI> Fifteen fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Elzas,</HI> for <HI>Germany;</HI> Twenty Flemings, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ten Spaniards from <HI>Roussillon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hotel-dieu,</HI> or Hospital destined fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Poor, is also very ancient, being buil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> since the Year 660, and well worth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seeing. It's very spacious, and kept very clean, considering the vast number of Sic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> always attended there by religious Wo∣men, that make their Vows in the Hands of the Dean of our Lady-Church. Behind the House of these Ladies, is a Statue of Stone, which most People believe to be that of <HI>Esculapius.</HI></P>
<P>The Hospital of the <HI>Quinze Ʋints,</HI> or Twenty Score, founded by St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> in Memory of the Three hundred Christians that had their Eyes put out by the Saracens, ought not to be forgotten. That of St. <HI>Lew∣is,</HI> founded by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. for those that should be sick of the Plague, is renowned for its Building, Courts, Offices and Foun∣tains. That of <HI>La Charité,</HI> kept and served by Fryars of that Name, is very neat, and the People well attended. Besides these, there is the <HI>Incurable,</HI> and 25 other Houses for the Sick and Poor.</P>
<P>The great and little <HI>Chastelets</HI> are the two ancientest Buildings in that City, said to be built by <HI>Caesar,</HI> or at least by <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, who called <HI>Paris, his Delight and well beloved Town;</HI> now they are Prisons
<PB N="87" REF="50"/> of the Civil Lieutenant and Presidial, that keep their Courts there. The Palace of <HI>Cluni,</HI> in the <HI>Maturins</HI> Street, where the Pope's Nuncio's generally Lodge, deserves to be seen. It was formerly <HI>Julian</HI> the A∣postate's Baths, and the Water was convey'd thither by Aquaeducts, from the little Vil∣lage of <HI>Arcueuil</HI> near <HI>Paris,</HI> as may still be seen by some Remains of the Ruines.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bastille</HI> is a very strong Castle, built above the Gate of St. <HI>Anthony.</HI> Its Form is square, with four great Towers that defend it of every side; its Ditch ve∣ry deep, and other Fortifications as regular. Here Persons of Quality, suspected of Crimes against the State are imprisoned, and there is a Governour to take care of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arsenal</HI> built just by the River, is a great Building with store of Arms, fine Gardens, and curious Sets of Elm-Trees; the Great Master of the Ordnance has his Apartment, and keeps his ordinary Resi∣dence there.</P>
<P>The Town-House built by <HI>Francis</HI> I. was new built by <HI>Henry</HI> the Great; the Front is extraordinary well worked, the Cham∣bers spacious, the Pavilions uniform, and the Pillars and Clock-Tower magnificent. Its Revenues are so great, that the King very often orders Payments of vast Sums <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hence. They must be able Men that are
<PB N="88" REF="51"/> received Sheriffs here, and sometimes the whole Court move to have the Man they like, chosen Lord Mayor or <HI>Provost</HI> of Merchants, because the Place is of such con∣sequence, and he that has it has so much Authority over the People,, that he may raise them against whom he pleases. The Government of the Town is in his and the four Sheriffs Hands, who stand but two years in their Office. Besides these, there are twenty six Councellors, and ten Serge∣ants that serve the Provost and his Sheriffs with sixteen Quaterniers and their Com∣missaries, and other under Officers, to hinder any Disorder or Tumult; an hundred and twenty Archers or Watch-men, who with six∣ty <HI>Arbalestiers,</HI> or Cross-bow-men, an hundred <HI>Arquebusiers,</HI> or Small-shot-men, the Foot and Horse Watch, go the Rounds every Night, commanded by the Captain of the Watch, called the Knight of the Watch, <HI>Le Chevalier du guet.</HI> The Town's Attorney takes the Title of King's Attorney. The Company of Wine-Cryers, to the Number of twenty four, are imploy'd in Funerals and twenty four Salt-Porters, that carry the King's Bodies, are a sort of other Offi∣cers of this Town, where the Provost of Merchants and Sheriffs are allowed Noble∣men, and Knighted after two years Em∣ployment.</P>
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>
<P>As for the Justice of <HI>Paris,</HI> there is the Provost, a Man of the short Gown, three Lieutenants, <HI>viz.</HI> the Civil, Criminal and Particular, and several Counsellors, who compose the Presidial, and keep Court in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Great <HI>Chastelet.</HI> The Judge and Con∣suls of Merchants drawn out of that Body, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the number of five, being sworn before the Parliament sit in St. <HI>Mederic</HI>'s Cloister. As to the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> called also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Court of Peers, because the Dukes and Peers of <HI>France,</HI> and the Officers of the Crown take their Oaths there, and cannot be judged elsewhere, especially for any Crime; at least according to Law; for Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI> passed by this formally, when he gave Commission to try the Mar∣shall of <HI>Marillac,</HI> and afterwards the Duke of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> purposely perhaps to dero∣gate the Parliaments Authority, and make the Monarchy more absolute. However, <HI>Paris</HI> has yet the first and noblest Parlia∣ment in the Kingdom, having been found∣ed by <HI>Pepin,</HI> Head of the Second Stock of the French Kings in 755 or 756, and made se∣dentary by <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair, in 1302. The whole Governments of the <HI>Isle of France, Picardy, Champaign, Orleannois</HI> and <HI>Lionnois,</HI> and the Diocess of <HI>Macon</HI> depend upon it; and this Court only knows of the King's <HI>Regalia,</HI> Peer∣doms and Portions given to the Royal Chil∣dren. It's composed of eighteen Presidents,
<PB N="90" REF="52"/> and an hundred sixty nine Counsellors, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> divided into eight Chambers. The gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Chamber has seven Presidents, besides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first, and twenty nine Counsellors.

<P>Coming out of the great Court, and hav∣ing passed under an open Porch, you find a great Stair-case thirteen Fathoms and a half in length, and five in breadth. Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may go into the great low Apartment, by a Fort that is beyond this Stair-case, or by a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Arch that is at the bottom, and leads into a Porch which looks into the Garden, as all the other Pieces hereafter mentioned. Out of this Porch you enter consecutively into
<PB N="103" REF="58"/> two painted Halls; the different Pieces of Architecture represented in the last, make the Place appear as environed with several Pillars diversly adorned, and far greater and higher than really it is. Out of this you come into that which seems as a Vesti∣bule, when you enter by the Court into these Apartments; the Cieling is supported by eight Pillars of the Dorick Order, all fine Marble streaked red and white, brought from <HI>Dinan</HI> in the Country of <HI>Liege;</HI> the Chapters and Bases being of a greener, that is called little <HI>Breche.</HI> These Pillars are disposed into two parts, four on each side, that divide the Vestibule into three parts near the Wall, and over against the Pillars are Pilasters of the same Marble, that bear a Corniche which reigns all under the Pla∣fond, and over against the Windows are hollow Standings to place Statues in. Next this Vestibule, is another Hall, whereof the Cornish that bears the Cieling is supported by twelve Pillars of the Ionique Order, with their Pilasters behind them. The four Pillars that are in the Angles with the twelve Pilasters, are of black and white Marble, and the eight other are of a Mar∣ble called <HI>Breche,</HI> which comes from the Pyrenees, the Ground is white, with red, black, violet, blew and yellow Spots. The Chapters and Bases of the Pillars and Pi∣lasters are of delicate white Marble. Out

All these F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦gures are Copper gilt with Gold; the Pie¦ces over the Doors, and those that go across i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Windows, are of the Marble of <HI>Langue¦dock,</HI> Flame-coloured and White. On one sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this Hall, is the Chamber and Cabinet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Baths. All the Pieces over the Doors an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Windows, the Props, and generally all part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that have no Hanging, are laid with differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Marble in equal Divisions, so that all seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> solidly built therewith; and this Order is ob∣served to make use of the rarest and most pre∣cious in the Places that lye nighest to the King's Apartment, so that as you go out of one Chamber into another towards it, you will observe them more and more costly, both in Marble Sculpture and Paintings. This Or∣der is also kept in the upper Apartments, for there are eight Chambers or Halls, all of a Flower, that have each their different Mar∣ble and Painting. The first, that is five Fathoms and a half long, and five wide, where it wants Hangings, is laid with e∣qual Divisions of red, white, and a green∣ish Marble, called of <HI>Campan,</HI> which is brought from the <HI>Pyrenées,</HI> and with a white

The Window and Door-pieces are of a green and red Marble, with white Veins; the Sides or Wainscots of the same, of that of <HI>Langued<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c,</HI> and the Marble called of <HI>Egypt</HI> by equal Divisions upon a white ground.</P>
<P>On the other side, towards the Orangery; are other Lodgings like the former; but the Staircase is not quite so big as the King's, because the Chappel takes up part of the Place. The Apartment underneath is the <HI>Dolphin</HI>'s, and is adorned with fine different

<P>This Labyrinth is a Place composed of many small Alleys, so mixed and interwo∣ven one within the other, that it's hard to find the way out of them, and not easie to leave so pleasant a Place: For the great Number of Fountains and Water-works have Subjects drawn out of Thirty eight ancient Fables: But as the Description of each would be tedious, so I will only name the Fables that are represented.</P>

<P>From the Labyrinth you may go to the Orangery, thence by the Flower-Garden to the Water-Plot that lies before the Castle; this consists of five great Pieces, and two other, which altogether form extraordinary Figures.</P>
<PB N="112" REF="63"/>
<P>The little Park I have spoken of, is envi∣roned with another far greater, divided by a great many Walks, set with differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trees. The most remarkable thing in it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the great Canal, which begins at the en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the little Park, over against the Roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Walk, and is about 200 foot from <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Ba∣sin. It's 32 Fathoms wide, and 800 long and at the Head thereof is a Plot of Wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that is octogone, four of the sides drawn in a circular Line, three in a Right, and the o∣ther joyning it to the Canal. This Piece has sixty Fathoms diameter, of one side se¦parates the little from the great Park, and at the other end joyns the Canal, which at the other Extremity has a Water-Plot 200 Fathoms long, and 100 wide, and is cross'd in the middle by one that is 200 foot wide, and of one side leads to <HI>Trianon,</HI> and of the other to the <HI>Mesnagerie,</HI> the Place where rare Fowls and Beasts, brought from foreign Parts are kept. In a great Court on the Left-hand, are the Stables, Sheep-Folds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with all that belongs to a Base-court.</P>
<P>The little Palace has its Particular Court at the end of a great Walk set with Trees. The chief Lodging or Apartment is Octo¦gone, consisting only of a Hall, with two little Pavilions before it. In the middle of of it are Stairs that lead into the Vestibule, and thence into this Hall, which is environ∣ed with a Court of an Octogone Figure
<PB N="113" REF="63"/> too, with Iron Grates or Rails that part it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom seven other Courts. This Hall has also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound Balconies, whence one may look into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese Courts, which are all full of fine and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urious Birds, and of an incredible number of foreign wild Beasts of every Kind. I must not forget, that since the present King has chosen <HI>Versailles</HI> for his ordinary Residence, several private Men have built there Houses, so that it is become a pretty good Brough.</P>

<HEAD>Trianon.</HEAD>
<P>THis House, opposite to the former, on the other side of the Canal, and at the Right-hand, as you go from <HI>Versailles</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> is a very fine Piece of Building. The outward Front is 64 fathoms, sinking in form of a half Oval, in the middle of which is the principal Door all of Iron, with two Ballisters at the sides that joyn to small Pa∣vilions, and close the Entry. By this Door you enter into a Court that is almost oval, only squared to the Right and Left by two Buildings, separated from that in the Mid∣dle, whereof one serves the Lords, and the other the Warden of the Castle.</P>
<P>These Buildings are each twelve Fathoms square, with their separate Courts and other Pavilions that form the Corners of the whole Front of this House. They that go to see this Castle, enter generally by the <HI>Conciergery</HI>

<P>All these Places look, and have Doors into a Plot over against the Chambers, where are Spouts that throw up Water out of four Ba∣sins,
<PB N="115" REF="64"/> built upon Piedestals. Out of this Plot you go down into another Garden that is al∣ways well stocked with Flowers.</P>

<P>REpassing the <HI>Seine,</HI> you find, a League west∣wards of <HI>Paris,</HI> the Royal Castle of <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI> built near a pleasant Wood by <HI>Francis</HI> I. upon the Pattern of the <HI>Escurial,</HI> or the Palace of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> It was designed for a very fine House, but the French Kings having since delighted in other places, and little care being taken of it, it decays every day.

<P>Two Leagues higher, on the Southwest; is a Village called <HI>Haubert de Villiers,</HI> with the famous Church of <HI>Nôtre Dame des Ver∣tus,</HI> or our Lady of Vertues.</P>
<P>Descending to the North, towards <HI>Paris,</HI> you find, a little Mile off it, the Village of <HI>Montmartre,</HI> called in Latin, <HI>Mons Marty∣rum,</HI> because, as 'tis pretended, St. <HI>Denis</HI> and his Companions were beheaded there, before the Idol of <HI>Mercury.</HI> And there∣fore when Christianity had got the better of <HI>Paganism,</HI> a Chappel, and afterwards an

<P><HI>Vincennes,</HI> commonly called <HI>Le bois de Vin∣cennes,</HI> is a strong Castle in a Wood, not quite a League off <HI>Paris;</HI> towards the East, it's surrounded with a good Ditch, and eight great square Towers for its Defence. <HI>Philip August</HI> raised up a Wall about the Wood in 1185. <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valois</HI> begun the
<PB N="117" REF="65"/> Tower or Castle in 1337, which K. <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> V. ended. Q <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> begun the Gallery that is on the side of <HI>Paris</HI> in 1614, and <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. added new Buildings to it. Its Court is spacious and fair, a side of it is the Holy and Royal Chappel, dedicated to the Blessed Trinity by King <HI>Charles</HI> V. in 1379. Here are also the Chains of the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> sent thither by <HI>Charles</HI> VI. to punish that City's Rebellion. This Place is so very pleasant by its fine Walks in the Woods about it, that several Kings have chosen it to end their Lives in, as <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair, <HI>Lewis Hutin,</HI> or the Proud, and <HI>Charles</HI> the Handsome. Farther into the Woods, is a Convent of <HI>Minims,</HI> surnamed <HI>Les bons Hommes,</HI> which is one of the pleasantest Mo∣nasteries that can be seen. As for the Ca∣stle, the Inside is every whit as magnificent as what appears without.

It's said the Royal House was built by <HI>Francis</HI> I. at the Solicitation of his Daughter <HI>Claudia,</HI> who one day seeing a Hound or Spaniel discover a Spring, desir∣ed her Father to build an House there. This Design was since continued by most of the succeeding Kings, and perfected by <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and is now one of the finest in <HI>France,</HI> by reason of the great Number of its Springs, the vast Scope of its Forests, the Beauty of its Gardens, the Length of its Canals, the Richness of its Apartments, Paintings, Statues, and other Curiosities. It would be too tedious to describe all these in particular, there being about 900 Cham∣bers, Cabinets, Halls and Galleries that be∣long to this great Place, therefore I will only hint at the most principal. The First thing to be observed in going in, is the great

Hence you may go into the Council-Chamber, where is the Picture of the Count of <HI>Ombe,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medi∣cis</HI>'s Uncle. Thence into that of the Baths which has a St. <HI>John the Baptist</HI> at the Door, and an <HI>Adonis</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> upon the Chimny. This leads you into the new Chamber, where is represented the Dutchess <HI>Gabrielle,</HI> under the Form of <HI>Diana,</HI> holding a Hunt∣ing-Horn in her Hand.

<P>The King's Chamber comes next, where∣in Marshal <HI>Biron</HI> was disarmed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth's Order; and the Queen's Anti-chamber, where <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. was born.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of <HI>Picardy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Province hath the Isle of <HI>France</HI> on the South, <HI>Champaign, Haynaut,</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> on the East, the County of <HI>Artoys</HI> and the Streights of <HI>Dover</HI> on the North; the <HI>British</HI> Sea and <HI>Normandy</HI> on the West. It is one of the principal parts of the An∣tient <HI>Belgae:</HI> Though the Name of <HI>Picardy</HI> be Modern, and its Original contested. The Opinion that seems to me the more reaso∣nable, is that of <HI>Adrian de Valois,</HI> who de∣rives it from <HI>Pique</HI> and <HI>se Piquer, to have a Pick,</HI> or <HI>to be passionate.</HI> He conjectures that it was first a Nick-Name given by the
<PB N="161" REF="87"/> Scholars of the University of <HI>Paris</HI> to their Fellows of that Province. And indeed we see that it was first the Sirname of some Private Men, as of one <HI>Clement</HI> in 1023, and one <HI>William</HI> in 1099; and that in process of time it became at last the name of the whole Province, as may be read in <HI>Nicolas de Bray,</HI> about the year 1215. Besides that the <HI>French,</HI> especially in those Ages, were wont to end in <HI>ard,</HI> the words signifying the de∣fects of the mind, as <HI>Babillard, Bavard, Musard, Fetard,</HI> &amp;c. It was formerly one of the greatest Governments of <HI>France,</HI> before the Country of <HI>Beauvaifis, Noyon, Soissons. Valois,</HI> and <HI>Laon</HI> were taken from it. To make amends, the County of <HI>Artois,</HI> which by the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> in 1677, was wholly yielded to <HI>France,</HI> has been added to it, together with the old Conquests of <HI>Landrecy, Quesnoy,</HI> and <HI>Avenes,</HI> in <HI>Hainaut.</HI></P>
<P>This Country is extraordinary fruitful in Corn, and has the conveniency to send it away by Sea to <HI>Paris,</HI> and other places; whence it is esteemed the chief Granary of the Isle of <HI>France;</HI> but there grows no Wine; either because the Inhabitants neglect to plant Vines, or rather that the Country is too cold.

Five years ago the present French King begun to build a Mole, upon great piles droven into the sand, beneath the low-Water-mark, which will be 30 yards wide, and make an Harbour fit to receive third or fourth Rates Men of War, whereas a good Merchant-man cannot get into the present Havens: This Work, if once finish'd, will be of dangerous consequence to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> the rather for that the Port of <HI>Do∣ver</HI> is not capable of receiving Men of War, at least but at high Spring-Tides.

<P>As the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> was very large under the first Race of their Kings, since <HI>Clovis</HI> the great, and that youngest Sons had a share in the Succession to the Soveraignty; so this Realm was divided into two great parts, where∣of the most Easterly, which reached from <HI>Pi∣cardy</HI> and <HI>Champaign</HI> to Upper <HI>Germany,</HI> or from the <HI>Meuse</HI> to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and beyond that River was called <HI>Ausstrie,</HI> or <HI>Austrasie.</HI> The other more Westerly extended it self from <HI>Nor∣mandy</HI> the Isle of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Beausse</HI> to the Coasts of that Kingdom, and was called <HI>Neustra∣sia, Neustria,</HI> sometimes <HI>Neptricum,</HI> and in French <HI>Neustrie.</HI> It was at first included between the <HI>Meuse</HI> and the <HI>Loire,</HI> then between the <HI>Seine</HI> and the <HI>Loire,</HI> and at last this name was appropria∣ted

<P>I would begin here the particular descripti∣on of this Province, were it not that I think my self Obliged to say something of the first Dukes of <HI>Normandy,</HI> from whom our Kings of <HI>England</HI> are descended, and by the way to show the just claim they may still lay to that Noble Dukedom their Ancient Patrimony. <HI>Raoul</HI> ha∣ving setled himself in <HI>Normandy,</HI> not only by Conquest and force of Arms, but also by the
<PB N="190" REF="102"/> voluntary yielding of <HI>Charles the simple,</HI> and his Marriage with <HI>Gisele,</HI> Niece to that King, gave good Laws to his Subjects: Among others, that the Poor might have right done to them without any Expence, he ordered, that any Murderer, Robber, Incendiary, or any one that should pursue another with a naked Sword, should be stop'd, and brought before a Justice, without any other Warrant than the Out-cry of the Wronged Person. This is the Origin of what the <HI>Normans</HI> call the Clamour of <HI>Haro,</HI> which they make use of, when they think them∣selves wrong'd or oppress'd, perhaps too often, as they are accus'd to be of a litigious Temper. Howsoever it may be, <HI>Haro</HI> seems to be an ab∣bridged word for <HI>Ha Raoul,</HI> as tho' they would still implore the Justice of their first Duke. <HI>Raoul</HI> took the name of <HI>Robert</HI> at his Baptism, was succeeded by <HI>William</HI> I. surnamed <HI>Long∣sword</HI> in 917, or 920, and was succeeded by three Princes, named <HI>Richard, Robert</HI> II. Son to the last of them in 1028. was Father to our <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, whom he got from <HI>Helen,</HI> Grand Daughter to <HI>Edmond Ironside,</HI> one of our Saxon Kings, if we may believe <HI>Thomas Rudborn,</HI> who quotes several Authors for this History. Thus <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy</HI> were qui∣etly enjoyed by our Monarchs, till the French King <HI>Philip August</HI> taking hold of the Civil War, which the English Barons raised against King <HI>John,</HI> deprived him of his Dutchy of <HI>Norman∣dy,</HI> under pretence that he had caused his Ne∣phew <HI>Arthur</HI> to be murther'd. It was recon∣quered by <HI>Henry</HI> V. but lost again under <HI>Henry</HI> VI. during the Civil Wars between the Hou∣ses
<PB N="191" REF="102"/> of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster.</HI> However, it remains uncontested, that this Province has been pos∣sess'd successively by fourteen Dukes of the same Race, six of whom were Kings of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>I must not forget that the Normans are Witty and Ingenious, especially in making Esta∣blishments, which their Envious Neighbours would find fault with, and on that account stain them with Treachery. Their Countrey is so great and so Populous, that there are reckon'd a hundred Towns, and a hundred and fifty conside∣rable Burroughs: So that the Reader may not expect I should describe them all, but only such as are most Eminent, and of which some Particulars are come to my knowledge.</P>

<P>THis Countrey was anciently inhabited by the <HI>Veliocasses, Velocasses</HI> or <HI>Belocasses,</HI> whose Ter∣ritories reached from the <HI>Andelle</HI> to the <HI>Oys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> but after the Normans had conquer'd the best part of <HI>Neustrie,</HI> it was divided into two parts, where∣of that which obey'd the French King was called the <HI>French,</HI> and the other the <HI>Norman Vexin. De Valois</HI> relates a remarkable thing, namely, that the feuds between these two People are yet as great, as if they were still Enemies, and had not the same Master; so that they seldom mar∣ry together, nor will they Trade, or have any

King of <HI>France, William the red</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> took it from a Knight call'd <HI>Payen,</HI> and fortified it in 1228. <HI>Henry</HI> III.

It has gotten its Name from the Rocks upon which it is built, or wherewith its encompass'd which in the Franco-German Language are call'd <HI>Fales</HI> or <HI>Fels,</HI> and the Normans give still the Name of <HI>Falaise</HI> to great heaps of Snow. Thô this place was so very strong, yet it was surrendred, upon the first Summons to <HI>Philip August</HI> in 1203, but having been retaken by the English, it was kept by them one of the longest of all, and defended by the Warlike <HI>Talbot</HI> till the Year 1450.

<P>LIttle <HI>Brittain</HI> is a kind of <HI>Peninsula,</HI> being in∣cluded the Sea on the North, West and South, and having part of <HI>Poictou, Anjou, le Maine</HI> and <HI>Normandy</HI> on the South-east. It is one of the biggest Provinces of <HI>France,</HI> com∣prehending the greatest part of the third <HI>Lyon∣noile,</HI> and being extended above 70 leagues East and West, and above 45 North and South from the Sea near <HI>Normandy</HI> to the Borders of <HI>Poictou,</HI> but its none of the fertilest, having but little Corn, and that black too, little or no Wine, but a great many Meadows, a vast number of Marshes and Forrests, some Iron, Lead and Sil∣ver Mines, and the best Sea-ports in the whole Kingdom. They reap a great quantity of Hemp, of which they make Linnen; their Woods and Meadows give them the convenien∣cy of breeding good Race-Horses, and a vast number of black Cattel and Sheep that furnish them with abundance of Butter and Milk, and their Sea-ports make them the best Fishers and Mariners in <HI>France.</HI> The Inhabitants appear Clownish, but are really shrewd and cun∣ning.</P>
<PB N="230" REF="122"/>
<P>Tho' <HI>Pliny</HI> asserts, [<HI>l.</HI> 4. c. 17, 19.] That the <HI>Galli</HI> call'd in their own Language <HI>Aremorica,</HI> the Countrey included between the <HI>Garumne,</HI> the Sea, and the Pyrenean Mountains, which the Romans nam'd afterwards <HI>Aquitain,</HI> yet it appears that <HI>Caesar,</HI> and other Ancient Geogra∣phers understood by <HI>Armorica</HI> and <HI>Armorici,</HI> the Nations and Cities bordering upon the Oce∣an, from the mouth of the <HI>Seyne,</HI> to that of the <HI>Loire;</HI> so that the Ancient <HI>Armorique</HI> compre∣hended all <HI>Brittany,</HI> and a good part of <HI>Normandy,</HI> that is, all the third <HI>Lyonnoise,</HI> and about one half of the second, but this Name deriv'd from an old Gaulish word, <HI>Armor, Ad mare,</HI> or near the Sea, became in process of time proper to <HI>Britanny.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Beda</HI> relates, [<HI>l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 1.] That in old times some Armoricans came over into our Island, and master'd the Southern parts of it; however 'tis not from them that our Ancestors got the Name of <HI>Brittains,</HI> since these Gauls were only known by that of <HI>Armorici,</HI> whereas it cannot be doubted but that our Brittains gave their Name to <HI>Brittanny:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Annal. Egin. ad An. <HI>786.</HI></NOTE> For <HI>Eginhard</HI> testifies, that about the Year 441. at the beginning of <HI>Valentinian</HI>'s Empire, the English and Sax∣ons having invaded our Island, a great part of the Inhabitants put to Sea, and Landing on the borders of <HI>Vannes</HI> and <HI>Cornouaille,</HI> made them∣selves Masters of the Countrey: Accordingly we find one <HI>Mansuetus</HI> Bishop of these Brittains subscribing to the Council of <HI>Tours,</HI> in 461.</P>
<P>Our Refugees made not long since a great Fi∣gure in the World, for about the end of the fifth Age their King <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>othimas</HI> having made a League
<PB N="231" REF="122"/> with the Emperor <HI>Anthemius</HI> against the <HI>Goths,</HI> was defeated by them on the borders of <HI>Berry,</HI> before he could joyn with his Confederates, and lost in that Battle the best part of 12000 men.</P>
<P>So great a loss however was not able to run them altogether down, for we find that even in the following Century they were a Terror to the French, so that <HI>Clovis</HI> the Great's Grand-Children, <HI>Theodebert</HI> and <HI>Thierry,</HI> were forc'd to keep Counts and Marquesses on the Frontiers, to oppose the Incursions of the Brittains into the Territory of <HI>Nants.</HI></P>
<P>They being so Warlike, and their Castles and Forts being surrounded with Woods and Marshes, the Captains of <HI>Charlemaign</HI> were not like to have subdued them as they did a∣bout the end of the eighth Century, had they not divided themselves into several petty prin∣cipalities; notwithstanding they recover'd their liberty under <HI>Charles</HI> the Bald, by the Valour of <HI>Nomenoius</HI> and <HI>Herispoius</HI> his Son, to whom <HI>Charles</HI> yielded the Territories of <HI>Rennes, Nantes</HI> and <HI>Retz,</HI> when he saw that he could not recover them.</P>
<P>Others relate the Settlement and Adventures of our Brittains somewhat differently. They say, that about the Year 393. a Brittish Captain, called <HI>Conan. Meriadoc,</HI> Lieutenant to <HI>Maximus,</HI> who had been saluted Emperor in <HI>England,</HI> in 382. obtained leave of his Master to erect a Kingdom in Little <HI>Brittain,</HI> which his Successors enjoyed independently from any other till a∣bout the Year 570. that <HI>Chilpric</HI> I. King of <HI>France</HI> made them Tributary. After the Death
<PB N="232" REF="123"/> of <HI>Judicael</HI> about the Year 700: This Kingdom was rent into several petty Principalities, so that <HI>Charlemaign</HI> had no great trouble to subdue them as he did in 787.</P>
<P><HI>Neomenes,</HI> or <HI>Nomenoius</HI> descended from the Ancient Kings of <HI>Brittany,</HI> was made Lieute∣nant to the Emperor <HI>Lewis</HI> the Meek, but he revolted against him, took the Title of King, and dyed in 852. <HI>Heruspeus,</HI> or <HI>Herispoius</HI> his Successor maintain'd the War against the French King, till 866. that he was kill'd by his Cousin <HI>Solomon.</HI> This last reigned 12 years, and was murdered in 878. After his Death this Pro∣vince was rent again by several Lords, who made themselves Soveraigns in their respective Countries. This lasted to the Year 930, or 935. that <HI>Alain</HI> I. subdued the whole Province, and enjoyed it under the Title of County. He was succeeded by twelve or thirteen more, who possesesed it under the same Title, but in all So∣veraignty, till a French Prince, called <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Dreux,</HI> Grandson to the French King <HI>Lewis</HI> the Burly, having married <HI>Alix</HI> Heiress of this County in 1213. consented to acknowledge the French King <HI>Lewis</HI> IX. for his Liege Lord, who in recompense gave him the Title of a Duke: And for having thus betray'd the Liberties of the Brittains, he was surnamed by them the Duke <HI>Mauclerc,</HI> that is, The Ignorant or unskil∣ful Duke. <HI>Philip</HI> the fair King of <HI>France</HI> made <HI>John</HI> II.

<P>In this Government are included 14 or 15 smaller Countries, situated North and South, and along the River <HI>Loire,</HI> which divides the whole into two parts very near equal. <HI>Maine, Perche, High-Beauce,</HI> or Land <HI>Chartrain, Vende∣mois,</HI> and part of <HI>Gatinois,</HI> lye on the North of that River going from West to East. <HI>Nivernois, Orleanois,</HI> or lower <HI>Beauce, Blaisois, Touraine,</HI> and <HI>Anjou,</HI> lye round about the <HI>Loire</HI> East and West; <HI>Poictou,</HI> the Land of <HI>Aunis, Augoumois,</HI> and <HI>Berri</HI> are the most Southern parts.</P>
<P>All these Countries are fruitful in Corn, Wine, Fruits, Cattle and Game. There are a

The Forrest of <HI>Senonches,</HI> in the Countrey of <HI>Chartres,</HI> is 7 miles long, and 5 broad. That of S. <HI>Cyr les Antrain</HI> in the Electi∣on of <HI>Clamecy,</HI> is well near 10 miles in length, but of no considerable breadth: There is no Province in <HI>France</HI> which has so many paved ways.</P>

<P>THis Country is situated between the Isle of <HI>France, Perche, Blaisois</HI> and <HI>Orleanois.</HI> The City of <HI>Chartres,</HI> call'd in Latin <HI>Autricum Car∣nutum,</HI> from the River <HI>Autura, Eure</HI> on which it lyes, has a Presidial Seat and Bishoprick, for∣merly suffragan of <HI>Sens,</HI> and now of <HI>Paris,</HI> since the Year 1622. This City is so Ancient, that some Authors believed that the Issue of <HI>Gomer</HI> having pass'd into the Gauls, some time after <HI>Noah,</HI> did lay the Foundation of it. Others maintain, that the <HI>Druides</HI> and <HI>Sarrho∣nides,</HI> the Ancient Priests of the Gauls, did build it, and foretold, that a Virgin should one day grow big with Child without the Compa∣ny of a Man. It was this which obliged <HI>Pris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns,</HI> Governour for the Romans, to erect a Temple to that Blessed Virgin, with this Inscrip∣tion,<HI>Virgini Pariturae,</HI> or <HI>to the Virgin who is to bring forth.</HI> Thus it was that they ador'd at <HI>Athens</HI> an unknown God. But whatever be of it, the People of this Countrey made a long and bold Resistance to the Romans, kill'd one <HI>Tasgetus,</HI> tho' he was of the Royal Blood of their own King's, because <HI>Caesar</HI> had set him over them, and after that great Conqueror had subdued them, he was glad that they would accept of

This Province is about 30 Leagues in length, &amp; 20 in breadth. It aboundeth with great Quarries of Slate, wherewith most of their Houses are co∣vered, and even oft employed by Masons in∣stead of Stones.

However it be, this abundance of Water makes the Rich∣es of <HI>Anjou,</HI> both by a vast quantity of sweet Fish, and the great number of Gardens and Mea∣dows they make therewith fruitful. This Pro∣vince is partly Champian, and has many Woods and Forrests, where abound Stags, Hinds, Bucks, Does, Hares, and all sorts of great and small Game; and partly mountainous and cover'd with Vineyards, that produce as delicate Wine as any in <HI>France,</HI> most of which together with their Brandies and those of <HI>Orleanois</HI> are trans∣ported along the <HI>Loire</HI> to <HI>Nantes,</HI> and thence into Forreign Country; for <HI>Brittany</HI> has none, or but very little of its own.</P>

<P><HI>Angers</HI> is much resorted unto, at a Festival, which the Roman Catholicks call <HI>La-Fete-Dieu,</HI> the Feast of God. Then you may see all the Priests and Monks, and 4000 Inhabitants, bear∣ing as many kindled Torches; and withall as many engraven Histories of the Holy Scrip∣ture, as there are Wards in the City. This Ceremony has been instituted to attone for the pretended Crime of the Archdeacon <HI>Berenger,</HI> who opposed Transubstantiation in its birth.</P>
<P>At the solicitation of some studious Persons, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. instituted lately a Royal Academy at <HI>Angers,</HI> with the same prerogatives as that of <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> save the right of <HI>Committimus,</HI> that is, the Pri∣viledge of bringing the Suits wherein its Mem∣bers are concern'd before his Masters of Re∣quests, at the first motion. This Academy is compos'd of 30 Members, who must all be <HI>An∣gevin</HI> Men born, or at least settled Inhabitants of <HI>Anjou.</HI> They are not to meddle with Mat∣ters of Religion and Divinity, nor with Poli∣ticks, unless it be by the King's Directions, nor to judge of any Composures besides their own: They have four Officers, a Director, a Chancellor, and two Secretaries. The Bishop, the King's Lieutenant in the City and Castle of <HI>Angers,</HI> the President, Lieutenant General, and King's Attorney in the Presidial, and the Mayor of the City may assist at their Assemblies, thô not at the time of the Elections.</P>

The Castle is flanked with 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great round Towers, and a half Moon, and built upon a Rock, with a large Ditch at the foot of it. There is a rare Engine by which they may lift up such things as they stand in need of: However, in 1585. the Protestants ma∣ster'd this Castle, but were soon expell'd by the Inhabitants. By reason of the strength of this place, Prisoners of State are oft sent thi∣ther.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Angers</HI> is governed by a Mayor and 24 Sheriffs. The University founded in the Year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>98. by <HI>Louis</HI> II. is famous for the Ci∣vil and Canon Law, and has had famous Pro∣fessors, and bred up many Learned Scholars. <HI>Angers</HI> lyes 17 leagues East N.

<P><HI>Saumur</HI> is situated upon the River <HI>Loire,</HI> a∣bout 10 leagues from <HI>Angers</HI> to the South-east: it is as pleasant a place as can be seen, and Strangers are mightily taken with it, for the Town is seated at the foot of a Hill, Wall'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

The prospect of the Castle on the <HI>Loire,</HI> and the neighbouring Plains, is very delightful. The strength of this p ace gives occasion to the Learned <HI>De Valois</HI> to de∣rive its name from the Latin <HI>Salvari,</HI> becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e its Fortifications preserve its Inhabitants from the attempts of their Enemies, so that <HI>Saumur</HI> should have been said for <HI>Sauf-mur,</HI> and <HI>Salmu∣rus</HI> for <HI>Salvus murus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saumur</HI> is a new Town, being not much above six hundred years standing. There is a Chappel under the Name of Our Lady <HI>des Ar∣dillers,</HI> which has been much frequented by reason of pretended Miracles; but since the Reformation, that Trade being much decay'd, <HI>Saumur,</HI> which was then but a small place, would not have grown considerable, had it not been given to the <HI>Protestants</HI> for one of their Towns of Security. It's in that Quality that <HI>Phillip du P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essis Mornay</HI> was Governour there in <HI>Henry</HI> IV's time, that famous Assertor of the Christian and Protestant Religion, whose Works are still the admiration of the Learned, and did so puzzle the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks of his time, that they would needs have all the Mini∣sters of <HI>France</HI> to have contributed to their Per∣fection. But what drew most People to <HI>Sau∣mur,</HI> was a <HI>Protestant</HI> University for Divinity and humane Learning. Here have flourished about the end of the last Age and the beginning of this, that renown'd <HI>Scotch</HI> Divine <HI>J.

<P><HI>Soulogne</HI> or <HI>Sologne, Secalaunia</HI> or <HI>Segalonia,</HI> is another small Country on the South of <HI>Blai∣sois,</HI> between the <HI>Loire</HI> and the <HI>Cher.</HI> Some de∣rive its <HI>Latin</HI> name <HI>Secalaunia,</HI> from the abun∣dance of Ry <HI>Secale,</HI> that grows in the Country; but <HI>de Valois</HI> takes it for a proper name, just such another as the <HI>Segalauni</HI> of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> the Inhabitants of <HI>Valence.</HI> However it be, <HI>Sologne</HI> depends for the Spiritual on the Bishop of <HI>Char∣tres,</HI> and is the fourth in number among his six Archdeaconships, and as for the Temporal, it resorts to the Bayliwick of <HI>Blois,</HI> as well as <HI>Du∣nois.</HI> It abounds with Fruits and Corn, and espe∣cially with Millet.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Blois, Blesum, Blesae,</HI> or <HI>Castrum Blesense,</HI> is situated upon the <HI>Loire,</HI> with the Title of County, Bailiwick, and Chamber of Accounts. It is almost equally distant from
<PB N="306" REF="160"/> <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Tours,</HI> being near thirteen Leagues from the former to the East, and twelve from the latter to the West. This Town has some Antiquity; for tho' <HI>Caesar</HI> does not mention it, and that there be no great reason to take it for the <HI>Corbilo</HI> of <HI>Strabo;</HI> yet it appears by <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Tours,</HI> that the Inhabitants were al∣ready in some consideration in the V. &amp; VI. Centuries; since in conjunction with the <HI>Orlea∣nois,</HI> they invaded the <HI>Dun is,</HI> and <HI>Anno</HI> 584, kept Prisoner <HI>Eberulf</HI> in the Church of St. <HI>Mar∣tin</HI> at <HI>Tours.</HI> The sight of <HI>Blois</HI> is very plea∣sant on the steep of a Hill on the North-side of the <HI>Loire,</HI> the River running through the Town and Suburb <HI>Vienne,</HI> that are joyn'd by a Stone-Bridge, whereon is a Pyramid, erected in 1598. With an Inscription to shew that <HI>Henry</HI> IV. re∣buil'd it. There is a sumptuous Castle, begun by the Kings <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. and <HI>Francis</HI> I. beau∣tified by Queen <HI>Katharine</HI> of <HI>Medicis,</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and by several Dukes of <HI>Orleans.</HI> As also a curious Garden adorn'd with Water-spouts and antick Statues. <HI>Henry</HI> III. call'd here twice the States of his Kingdom in 1577 and 1588, and during the last of these Assemblies, caus'd <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> and the Cardinal <HI>Francis</HI> his Brother, to be mur∣ther'd.</P>
<P>The excellency of the Air, and fertility of the Ground have given to <HI>Blois</HI> the Sir-name of, <HI>The City of Kings,</HI> or perhaps, it was because in this Country, they brought up the Children of the <HI>Fr.</HI> Kings, and that some of the Kings themselves have resided there. To which may be added, That the first Counts of <HI>Blois</HI> were the Fore-fathers
<PB N="307" REF="160"/> of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> from whom the present Kings are lineally descended, These Counts were as Sovereign as are now the Electors and other Princes of <HI>Germany;</HI> for they coyn'd Mony with an <HI>Hebraick</HI> Letter, a <HI>Flower de luce,</HI> and their own Name on one side; and on the backside a cross, with a <HI>B.</HI> and these two words <HI>Castro Ble∣sis.</HI></P>
<P>Besides what has been alledged for the anti∣quity of <HI>Blois,</HI> there are remains of an <HI>Aqueduc,</HI> wherein three Men can ride on Horseback a∣breast, and 'tis the common Tradition of the In∣habitants that at a Village call'd <HI>Orchese,</HI> almost 5 Miles West of the Town, <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> kept his Magazines; which they endeavour to con∣firm by the Ruins of some great Buildings, Arches strong, and thick Walls, and the like Antiqui∣ties; but have no other ground that I know of.</P>
<P>As to new VVorks, besides the Castle and Gardens, there is a Tennis Court esteemed the biggest in <HI>France,</HI> being 57 Foot in length, and 20 in breadth.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Blois</HI> and <HI>Orchese,</HI> not far from that Village was discovered, about a hundred Years since, a Mine of <HI>Terra Sigillata,</HI> or seal'd Earth, which is pretended to be as good as that of <HI>Lemnos.</HI></P>
<P>The Pasture Ground in the Valley of <HI>Loire,</HI> and the Exhalations that come out of the Vaults of St. <HI>Gervais</HI> are so wholesome, that the Milk of the Cattle that feeds thereabouts is excellent, especially the Cream that is esteemed one of the Dainties of the Country: The <HI>Boon-Christian</HI>-Pears, and Perdigron Plums are also rare Fruits,
<PB N="308" REF="161"/> and amongst Handy-works, the VVatches of <HI>Blois</HI> have got a Name through the whole King∣dom; but that which is most taking with Strangers, is the Purity of the <HI>French</HI> Tongue that is spoken here with a good Accent, as well by Country Men as by Gentlemen; and with all the charming Humour, and singular Honesty of the Inhabitants. I had almost for∣gotten that <HI>Peter l'Hermite,</HI> the first Preacher of the <HI>Crusado's,</HI> was a Native of <HI>Blois.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the Royal House and Park of <HI>Chambort</HI> or <HI>Chambourg,</HI> be not antient Mo∣numents, yet they deserve a particular descrip∣tion. The House lies almost seven Miles West of <HI>Blois,</HI> on the South side of the <HI>Loire,</HI> in the midst of the Park, and of a pleasant Forest. It was begun by King <HI>Francis</HI> I. at his coming out of the Prison, at the same time that he built <HI>Madrid</HI>-Castle near <HI>Paris;</HI> but tho' he employ'd eighteen hundred Workmen at the building of <HI>Chambort,</HI> during twelve years, yet it was not perfectly finished in his life time. A small Brook abounding with Fish, surrounds the Palace, which is adorn'd with many little Towers and Chimneys, that give a very fine prospect from far off, and the Forest is so pier∣ced through, that it hinders not the view of the adjacent Meadows, nor even of the Town of <HI>Blois,</HI> from the top of the Towers. The most remarkable thing is a Winding Stair-Case of 274 Steps, so large that several persons can go abreast, and so contriv'd that those who go up on one side and come down on the other, cannot see each other, tho' they can talk together. Add to this, that one may throw
<PB N="309" REF="161"/> a Ball perpendicularly through the Newel, from the top of the Stairs to the bottom. At the end of the Queens Garden, which takes up five hundred acres of Land, towards the Forest of <HI>Blois,</HI> is a Lane of six thousand great Elms, a Mile in length, and six Fathoms in breadth. I pass over the other Curiosities to observe, that the Park is encompass'd with a square-Wall, lying as a <HI>Parallelogramm</HI> inclin'd along the <HI>Loire,</HI> and cut through the River <HI>Cousson,</HI> being three <HI>Italian</HI> Miles East and West, two Miles North and South-West, and one and two thirds North and South-East.</P>
<P>There are 6 other Towns of some considerati∣on in the little extent of <HI>Blaisois, Mer</HI> or <HI>Menars</HI> the Town and the Castle, <HI>Suevre-cour-sur Loire</HI> and <HI>Die;</HI> these two lie over against <HI>Chambort,</HI> the former on the North, the latter on the South-side of the <HI>Loire; Onzain,</HI> mid-way be∣tween <HI>Amboise</HI> and <HI>Blois, Landes</HI> on the bor∣ders of <HI>Vendomois,</HI> and <HI>Contres</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Soulogne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chateau-Dun, Castellodunum,</HI> is the Capital City of the little Country of <HI>Dunois,</HI> 11 Leagues North of <HI>Blois.</HI> It has its Name from the Hill, on which it's seated on the East-side of the <HI>Loir, Dun</HI> in old <HI>Gaulish,</HI> signifying a Hill; but I know not where <HI>Duchesne</HI> has found that it was antiently call'd <HI>Rubeclara,</HI> for <HI>Ʋrbs Clara;</HI> be∣cause it may be seen from far off. There is a Castle strong by its Scituation and Works; but the Suburbs are larger, and better built than the Town, which has been ruined by the Wars. It seems to have been considerable in the sixth Century, since <HI>Sigebert,</HI> first King of <HI>Austrasia</HI>
<PB N="310" REF="162"/> erected it into a Bishopprick; but <HI>Papole</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chartres,</HI> form'd such a Powerful Opposition to it in the fourth Council of <HI>Paris</HI> in 573, that <HI>Promotus</HI> the new Prelate was forc'd to stand off his Right, and to lead a private Life. Another Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of the former Greatness of this Town, are its Arms, three Half Moons, with these Words, <HI>Extincta revivisco,</HI> besides many Ruins. There is an antient Abby of <HI>Cisternians,</HI> founded by <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> and several Collegiate and Parochial Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Chateaudun</HI> has an Election and Royal Seat of Justice, on which depend the <HI>Chastellenies</HI> of <HI>Montigny le Guanleon Courtalin, Monlitard, Lesclers</HI> and <HI>Rubetan,</HI> according to <HI>du Chesne,</HI> but I find none of them in the most accurate Maps.</P>
<P>The other Towns of <HI>Dunois</HI> are <HI>Alluye, Bon∣neval, Cloye, Moree, Freteval,</HI> all upon the <HI>Loire; Oucques, Marchenoir, Pathay, Bagnolet</HI> on the East, <HI>Dangeau, Brou-St. Romain, Anthen, la Bazoche-Gouet</HI> on the West side of that Ri∣ver.</P>
<P><HI>Romorantin,</HI> or <HI>Remorentin, Rivus Morentini,</HI> a Town and a Castle seated on the River <HI>Saudre Salera,</HI> eight Leagues South-West of <HI>Blois,</HI> is the Capital of <HI>Sologne,</HI> has the Title of a County, and is the Seat of the Election for that little Country. In 1597. the Monks, who suspected <HI>Henry</HI> IV. all his life, for having been once a <HI>Protestant,</HI> taught a young Maid called <HI>Martha Brossier,</HI> to counterfeit one that is pos∣sest of the Devil, and under that pretence, spread many things to the King's disadvantage. The Cheat succeeded in many places of the Di∣ocess
<PB N="311" REF="162"/> of <HI>Orleans,</HI> whither they carry'd her, but making bold to bring her to <HI>Paris,</HI> the Parlia∣ment took notice of it, and the pretended Devil was confin'd to her own Country. In 1560. <HI>Francis</HI> the XI. published here an Edict a∣gainst the <HI>Protestants,</HI> under the Name of He∣reticks. <HI>Du Chesne</HI> derives the Name of <HI>Romo∣rentin</HI> from <HI>Roma Minor;</HI> and pretends it to be a Work of the <HI>Romans,</HI> because of some old Ruins. The learned Mr. <HI>Pajon,</HI> Minister of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who so ingeniously defended the Re∣formation in his Answer to the <HI>Prejugez legiti∣mes</HI> of that famous Jansenist Mr. <HI>Nicole,</HI> was a Native of <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rantin.

<P><HI>ORleannois,</HI> properly so call'd, is situated be∣tween <HI>Berri, Gatinois,</HI> the Country of <HI>Chartres</HI> and <HI>Blaisois. Orleans</HI> is the antient City of <HI>Genabum,</HI> or <HI>Cenabum,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Cesar, Strabo, Ptolomy,</HI> and other antient Geo∣graphers. It's true, that the Description he makes of it, may in some manner be applied to <HI>Gien, Beaugency</HI> and <HI>Gergeau,</HI> because of the Proximity of those places to <HI>Orleans,</HI> and their Scituation on the <HI>Loire.</HI> But he who shall con∣sider that the <HI>Chartrains Carnutes</HI> had two con∣siderable Cities in their Country, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Tours</HI> relates that when King <HI>Gon∣tran</HI> made his solemn Entrance into this City, <HI>Latins, Syrians</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> proclaim'd his Praises each in his Tongue; whether these different Nations were learned Men, or foreign Merchants, who inhabited or frequented this Town for the sake of Trade, I shall not peremptorily de∣termine; tho' the latter seems to me the most probable. However it be, King <HI>Phillip</HI> the <HI>Fair</HI> sounded here an University for the Civil Law in 1312. to which Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the V. added the Cannon Law, in thirteen hundred sixty se∣ven. The Scholars are divided into four Nations, <HI>French, Germans, Normands</HI> and <HI>Pic∣cards,</HI> each of which has its particular Officers. There are two common and well furnish'd Li∣braries.</P>
<P>This City has also undergone the various fate of War. We have already seen how it was rid from the hands of the barbarous <HI>Attila.</HI> In 1417. it stood out a long Siege against the <HI>English,</HI> on behalf of the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> VII. The besieg'd were so weak'ned and fa∣mish'd that they had resolv'd to surrender them∣selves to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> but the <HI>English</HI> would not allow of it, tho' this Prince was their Ally, and then in their Army. This re∣fusal may be reck'ned one of the chief causes of the Expulsion of the <HI>English</HI> out of <HI>France,</HI> as it was the fatal period of the progress of their Arms. For as on the one hand it gave a mighty disgust to this Duke, one of the most potent Princes in <HI>Europe;</HI> so on the other, the
<PB N="316" REF="165"/> <HI>French</HI> were not loath to make an advantage of it. They set up a young Maid, a Shepher∣dess of about eighteen years, who pretending a Revelation to raise the Siege of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and bring the King triumphing into <HI>Rheims,</HI> in or∣der to his Coronation, so encourag'd their dis∣spirited Army, and fright'nd the Enemies, that she perform'd her promises; assisted by the Valour and Conduct of the famous Count of <HI>Dunois,</HI> but perhaps more by the jealousies rais'd between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> and then by the Civil Wars of the <HI>English.</HI> The Day of the Raising of this Siege, which was the Eighth of <HI>May</HI> 1418. is still kept as a Solemn Festival in <HI>Orleans,</HI> and a Monument of this Victory has been erected on the Bridge of the City. It represents the Bl. Virgin with our Saviour in her Arms as ready to be buried; on one side lies King <HI>Charles</HI> VII. upon his Knees, and on the other the Virgin of <HI>Orleans,</HI> (as they call her now) Booted and Spurr'd as a Trooper. This Maid was call'd <HI>Jeanne d' Arc,</HI> she was a Native of <HI>Vaucouleurs</HI> in <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI> but her Family being Nobilitated by the <HI>French</HI> Kings, had their Name chang'd into that of <HI>Lys, Flower de Luce,</HI> in memorial of her Ser∣vices to that Crown.</P>
<P>During the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> II. in 1560. the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> under the pretence of the con∣spiracy of <HI>Amboise,</HI> disarm'd the Inhabitants of <HI>Orleans,</HI> fill'd the suspected Houses with Soldiers, and then brought the young King, as triumphing, into the City. And well he might triumph, for he had gain'd his point so far, as to cause the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> to be sentenc'd to
<PB N="317" REF="165"/> lose his Head. But the Death of <HI>Francis</HI> II. forc'd him to alter his Politicks. In 1562. the <HI>Protestants</HI> under the Command of the same Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> seiz'd upon this place, and the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> himself was kill'd besieging it. However the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> retook it, but <HI>La Noue,</HI> one of the stoutest Commanders the <HI>Protestants</HI> ever had, master'd it again, five years after. In 1588. it declar'd for the <HI>Leaguers</HI> by the Intreagues of one <HI>Rossieux,</HI> Se∣cretary to the Duke of <HI>Mayenn,</HI> but it submit∣ed to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in one thousand five hundred ninety four.</P>
<P>The Name of <HI>Orleans</HI> comes undoubtedly from the <HI>Latin Aureliani,</HI> by which the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians after the second Century do call this City. There is still however some remains of the antient appellation of <HI>Genabum,</HI> in a nick∣name given to such Inhabitants as have not Travelled abroad, <HI>viz. Guepin,</HI> which I am apt to take for an abbreviation of <HI>Guenapin, Ge∣nabinus.</HI></P>
<P>This City is seated on the steep of an Hill on the Northern side of the <HI>Loire,</HI> that washes its Walls, and represents almost the figure of a stretched Bow. In sight of the Town, and the middle of the River is a pleasant Island cover'd with great Trees and Buildings. This Island is joyn'd with a Bridge on one side to the Town, and on the other, to the Suburb of <HI>Pontereau.</HI> This Bridge has 16 Arches, and 'tis upon it that the Monument of <HI>Jeane d' Arc</HI> is erected.</P>
<P><HI>Orleans</HI> is large and well built, the Streets are broad, strait and neat, being pav'd with a small square-stone. Some of the Markets are fine,
<PB N="318" REF="166"/> spacious, and overshadow'd with Trees. The most Magnificent Churches are the Cathedral of <HI>Sainte Croix,</HI> and the Collegiate of S. <HI>Aig∣nan.</HI> The body of the former is an hundred foot in length, sixty in breadth, and one hun∣dred and two in depth. It has fifty nine Ca∣nons and nine Dignitaries; the latter has but thirty one Prebendaries, whereof eight are dig∣nify d. Both have been much defac'd during the Civil Wars of Religion, but the Cathedral was repair'd by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. There are twenty two Parochial Churches. The Town-House has a very high Tower, whence the whole City and Suburbs may be discover'd. The <HI>Chastelet</HI> or Pallace of the Justice, is also a remarkable Building, seated on the River. The Town has eight Gates, and is fortify'd with a Terrass, and surrounded with a Wall defended by 40 round Towers fill'd with Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Orleans</HI> has a Bailywick, to which the Royal Seats of <HI>Bois-common, Chateau-renard, Yanville, Yevre-le-Chastel, La Neufvill-auxe Loges, Gien, Montargis.

<P><HI>Gergeau</HI> or <HI>Jargeau, Gargogilum</HI> or <HI>Jargo∣ilum,</HI> was an antient and noble Castle, and is still a pretty good Town, on the South side of the <HI>Loire,</HI> with a Bridge to pass that River, be∣longing to the Bishop of <HI>Orleans,</HI> four Leagues East of that City. In 1420. the Count of <HI>Sa∣lisbury</HI> took it for the <HI>English;</HI> but the year following it was retaken by <HI>John</HI> II. Duke of <HI>Alenson,</HI> and the Virgin of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who made the Count of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and several other Priso∣ners, to the number of four hundred, most of whom they had the Barbarity to kill. Next to <HI>Jargeau,</HI> is the Castle and Garden of <HI>Jenaille,</HI> with an artificial Rock made up of Shells and little glistering Stones of different colours, whence spring Water-spouts, that represent va∣rious figures.</P>
<P><HI>Sully, Solliacum,</HI> four Leagues South-East of <HI>Jargeau,</HI> on the same side of the River <HI>Loire,</HI> is an antient Castle and Town with the Title of a Barony, that has produced two famous Bishops of <HI>Paris</HI> in the Twelfth Century, <HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Odon</HI> of <HI>Sully,</HI> It was erected into a Dutchy and Peerdom by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in 1606, to gra∣tifie the Marquis of <HI>Rosny,</HI> who had done him so many services. This Lord was a <HI>Protestant,</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="167"/> and continu'd so all his life, notwithstanding the Apostacy of his Master. He has left <HI>Me∣moirs</HI> of what happen'd most considerable du∣ring his life, that are much esteem'd. The Lords of <HI>Sully</HI> have there a fine Castle, Park and Gar∣den.</P>
<P><HI>Clery</HI> upon the <HI>Doure,</HI> seven Miles South-East of <HI>Orleans,</HI> is a Village noted for a Church un∣der the name of our Lady.

<P><HI>NIVERNOIS, Nivernensis Pagus,</HI> has <HI>Gastinois, Puisaye,</HI> and <HI>Auxerrois</HI> on the North, the Dutchy of <HI>Burgundy</HI> on th'East, <HI>Bourbonnois</HI> on the South, and <HI>Berry</HI> on the West. It's Figure resembles a round, some∣what flatted, and irregularly bent, being of the same length and breadth, <HI>viz.</HI> above twenty leagues North and South from <HI>Tizy,</HI> upon the <HI>Loire</HI> to <HI>Clamecy</HI> on the <HI>Yonne,</HI> and as many East and West from <HI>Chateau-Chinon</HI> to <HI>La Guierche.</HI> It's subdivided into eight smaller Countries, namely, the Valley of <HI>Nevers</HI> upon the <HI>Loire,</HI> the <HI>Amognes</HI> on the <HI>Nieure,</HI> the Val∣leys of <HI>Montenoison,</HI> the Vallies of <HI>Yonne,</HI> the <HI>Moruan,</HI> the <HI>Bazois,</HI> the County between the <HI>Loire</HI> and <HI>Allier,</HI> and the <HI>Donizois:</HI> The whole abounding with Wood, Pasture-Ground and Cattle, being water'd with many Rivers besides the <HI>Loire,</HI> the <HI>Allier,</HI> the <HI>Yonne</HI> and the <HI>Cure,</HI> and comprehending thirty good Towns. Here are found some Silver-Mines, many more of Iron, and the best Free-Stone in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Before the <HI>Romans,</HI> these Countries belong'd to the <HI>Autunois Aedui,</HI> whose Territories extend∣ed from the <HI>Saone</HI> to the <HI>Allier,</HI> and compre∣hended also the greatest part of <HI>Bourbonnois.</HI> So that <HI>Samson</HI> mistakes, when he pretends that the <HI>Vadicasses</HI> dwelt in <HI>Nivernois,</HI> for they
<PB N="332" REF="173"/> were the Inhabitants of <HI>Chalons,</HI> as we shall shew in its due place. Thence it came that during the decay of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, <HI>Ni∣vernois</HI> pass'd into the hands of the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> the third of whom, call'd <HI>Richard le Justicier,</HI> gave it to one <HI>Ratier</HI> in 890, whose Posterity has kept it till Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> bought it together with the Dutchy of <HI>Rethel</HI> for <HI>Philip Mancini Mazarin,</HI> his Nephew, from <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Gonzague</HI> III. Duke of <HI>Mantoue, &amp;c.</HI> This County having been, in the mean while, suc∣cessively enjoy'd by many illustrious Houses, as <HI>Burgundy, Courtenay, France, Flanders, Cleves, Gonzague,</HI> into which the Heiresses of <HI>Nivernois</HI> Married.</P>

Caesar</HI> had made it his Store-House, keeping there his Corn and Mony, and the Horses he had bought in <HI>Spain▪</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but <HI>Eporedorix</HI> and <HI>Virodomarus,</HI> two Commanders <HI>Autunois,</HI> having surpriz'd and kill'd the Garri∣son, took away the Mony and Horses, and put the Town into Flames. This dependance upon <HI>Autun</HI> is the cause that the Bishoprick is not an∣tient, nor mention'd in any Notices of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> before the VI. or VII. Century. The name of <HI>Nevers Nivernum</HI> is also new, and most proba∣bly deriv'd from the Rivulet <HI>Nieure Niveris. Gregory</HI> of <HI>Tours</HI> calls <HI>Nevers Nivernum,</HI> but gives it only the Title of <HI>Oppidum</HI> a <HI>Town,</HI> so that it seems not to have been a City or Bishop's Seat, in his time, that is in the VI. Age. <HI>Ne∣vers</HI> is a pretty strong place, having no manner
<PB N="333" REF="173"/> of Suburbs and both the City and Town being included within the Walls, that are defended with many thick and high Towers, and sur∣rounded with deep Motes, fill'd up with Water. The most considerable Buildings are, 1. The Palace of the Dukes, where amongst other Goods is a great Marble-Table, upon which is another of less size, that appears transparent at the light of the Sun or a Candle, and shews most delicate Pictures. 2. The Bridge upon the <HI>Loire,</HI> consisting of twenty Arches, and as many Pillars all of Free-Stone, with a Draw∣ing-Bridge on each side, and Towers to defend them. 3. The Cathedral, dedicated first under the name of St. <HI>Gervais,</HI> and St. <HI>Protais,</HI> and then under the name of St. <HI>Cyr,</HI> hath a Steeple enrich'd on the outward side, with many em∣boss'd figures of Stone. <HI>Nevers</HI> has besides Eleven Parishes, an Abby of <HI>Augustinian</HI> Monks, another of Nuns, and several Religious Houses. It has a Bayliwick resorting to the Presidial of <HI>St. Pierre le Moustier,</HI> a Chamber of Accounts, and an Election depending on the Generality of <HI>Moulins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nevers</HI> was Erected into a Peerdom in 1459. by <HI>Charles</HI> VII. which Erection was confirm'd by <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. in 1464. by <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. in 1505, by <HI>Francis</HI> I. in 1521. That King rais'd it to the Dignity of Dutchy and Peerdom in 1538. which Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> got ratifi'd by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in 1660.

<P><HI>BERRY</HI> has <HI>Sologne</HI> on the North, from which it is separated by the <HI>Fuzou,</HI> on the East the <HI>Loire</HI> and the <HI>Allier</HI> di∣vide it from <HI>Puisaie, Nivernois</HI> and <HI>Bourbonnois.</HI> It consines <HI>La-Marche</HI> on the South, and <HI>Poictou</HI> and <HI>Touraine</HI> on the West. It's modern name has still some affinity with the <HI>Latin Bituriges,</HI> by which the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians call the <HI>Berru∣yers,</HI> the Inhabitants of this Country, who were once Masters of all <HI>Celtick Gaul.</HI> It was so at least, in the time of <HI>Tarquin the antient</HI> King of <HI>Rome.</HI> For <HI>Ambigat</HI> King of the <HI>Celtes,</HI> either to extend his Dominions, or to discharge his Realm of the multitude of People it was crowded with, resolv'd to make two Plantati∣ons under the Conduct of two Sons of his, <HI>Se∣govese</HI>
<PB N="339" REF="176"/> and <HI>Bellovese.</HI> The former lead his Co∣lony through the <HI>Hercynian,</HI> now the <HI>Black Forrest,</HI> into <HI>Germany,</HI> where they settled them∣selves, partly in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> partly on the <HI>Da∣nube,</HI> and partly in <HI>Friesland</HI> and <HI>Westphaly:</HI> These last were the Ancestors of the <HI>Franks</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> who, a thousand years after, pass'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> under <HI>Pharamond</HI> and <HI>Clodion,</HI> and began to conquer the <HI>Gauls,</HI> their antient ha∣bitation. As to <HI>Bellovese,</HI> he took his Way through <HI>Dauphine, Savoy,</HI> and the <HI>Alps,</HI> fol∣lowed by vast numbers of <HI>Berruyers, Auvergnats, Senonois, Autunois, Chartrains, Manseaux,</HI> &amp;c. who conquer'd the Northern Part of <HI>Italy,</HI> and gave it the name of <HI>Cisalpine Gaul.</HI> It's the same that was since call'd <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and com∣prehends <HI>Piedmont,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> the States of <HI>Genoa, Mantua,</HI> and part of the Do∣minions of <HI>Venice,</HI> and of <HI>Tuscany.</HI></P>
<P>I know not whether these Colonies weak'ning the <HI>Berruyers,</HI> caus'd the ruine of their Em∣pire; but in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s time they were no longer their own Masters, being under the protection, or rather dependance of the <HI>Autunois.</HI> How∣ever, they were still so powerful, as to have above twenty good Towns in their Country, which they all burnt except the Capital, to fa∣mish the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, tho' this hinder'd not their being subdu'd by this great General. In the Division of <HI>Augustus Berry,</HI> was made a part of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> and continu'd so under the <HI>French.</HI> During the weakness of <HI>Charlemaigne</HI>'s Succes∣sors, the Governors of this Province made themselves Sovereigns, and had the Title of Counts of <HI>Bourges,</HI> till <HI>Harpin,</HI> undertaking a
<PB N="400" REF="177"/> Journey into the Holy Land, sold his Estate to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> I. for sixty thousand golden Pence. This Lord turning a Monk at his return, this County was united to the Crown, till the year 1360, that the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>John</HI> erected it into a Dutchy and Peer∣dom for his youngest Son <HI>John,</HI> who dying without Male Issue, <HI>Berry</HI> return'd to the Crown. King <HI>Charles</HI> VI. gave it in portion to his fifth Son <HI>Charles,</HI> since the VII. of that name, King of <HI>France,</HI> and because, during the Wars with the <HI>English,</HI> this Province stood firm to his Int'rest, his Enemies call'd him con∣temptuously, <HI>King of Bourges.</HI> Since that time, <HI>Berry</HI> has often been the portion of youngest Sons, Daughters, and Queen Dowagers of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This Province is about 28 Leagues North and South, and as many East and West, being di∣vided into two Parts, almost equal by the <HI>Cher,</HI> and water'd by a vast number of other Rivers, which make this Country very pleasant and fer∣tile in all the necessary Conveniencies of Life. It especially abounds in Corn, and the Pasture-Ground is so excellent, that the Wooll and Cloth of <HI>Berry</HI> out-do all the others in <HI>France.</HI> The Name of <HI>Berry</HI> is derived from a <HI>Latin</HI> word us'd in the decay of that Tongue, <HI>Biturium.</HI> More antient Authors call the <HI>Ber∣ruyers Bituriges Cubi,</HI> to distinguish them from the Inhabitants of <HI>Bourdeaux Bituriges Vivisci,</HI> who seem to be a Colony of the former.</P>
<P><HI>Bourges, Avaricum Biturigum,</HI> and in latter Ages <HI>Biturigae, Bituricae, &amp; Betoricae,</HI> lies 19 Leagues South South-East of <HI>Orleans,</HI> upon the
<PB N="401" REF="177"/> River <HI>Eure,</HI> or <HI>Yeure, Avara,</HI> or <HI>Avera,</HI> whence the <HI>Latin</HI> Name of this City <HI>Avaricum</HI> seems to come. It's seated in a Soil fertile in Fruits and Wine, that is not so delicate, but more health∣ful than that of <HI>Orleans.</HI> The River <HI>Eure</HI> di∣vides it self into three Branches, one of which serves to cleanse the Town, and withal to Dy∣ers, Tanners, and the like; the other refreshes the Ditches that surround the Walls, and the third runs along the Suburb of St. <HI>Peter.</HI> These three Branches being joined, and the <HI>Eure</HI> en∣creased with the Waters of the <HI>Oron Ʋtrio;</HI> the <HI>Aurette Avara Minor,</HI> and the <HI>Moulon Molo,</HI> near the Monastery of St. <HI>Sulpice,</HI> this River begins to be Navigable.</P>
<P>The Situation of <HI>Bourges</HI> is not only con∣venient, but also very strong; for besides these Rivers and Ditches, it is defended by broad and deep Marshes, surrounded with good Walls, fortified with eighty Towers; so that three Camps would needs be required to besiege it on all sides; as one at <HI>Bourbon</HI>'s Gate, the other at <HI>Oron</HI>'s Gate, and the other at the Gate of St. <HI>Pri∣vatus. Cesaer</HI> observes that he could not shut it up with Trenches, and laid siege to it only on that side that was between the River and the Marsh. Nevertheless, he took it partly by Storm, and partly by Stratagem, having raised two high Towers, whence his Soldiers leaped on the Wall, which so frighted the Garison and Inhabitants, that they retir'd to the great Market, and thence endeavoured to make their escape thorough the Gates; but the <HI>Romans</HI> having master'd them, spar'd neither Sex nor Age; they were so in∣cens'd at the Murther of their Fellow Soldiers
<PB N="402" REF="178"/> in <HI>Gien.</HI> This was the Cause, that of 40000 People that were in this City, 800 hardly could save their Lives, by retiring into the Army of <HI>Vercingentorix,</HI> General of the <HI>Gauls.</HI></P>
<P>In the V. Century, <HI>Bourges</HI> was taken from the <HI>Romans</HI> by the <HI>Visigots,</HI> and from them by <HI>Clovis,</HI> and made part of the Kingdom of <HI>Or∣leans</HI> under <HI>Clodomir,</HI> and of that of <HI>Burgundy</HI> under <HI>Gontran</HI> his Nephews. <HI>Desiderius,</HI> or <HI>Di∣dier,</HI> General of <HI>Chilperic</HI> the first King of <HI>Paris</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> took it from the last in 583, and burnt it almost intirely; <HI>Charlemaign</HI> repair'd it, and <HI>Phillip August</HI> fortified and adorn'd it with a Castle, call'd the <HI>Great Tower,</HI> which was almost quite ruined in 1651. It was cut Diamond wise on the outside, and rais'd so high, that from the top, the Country might be viewed four Leagues round about. There has been seen a long time a Wood or Iron-Cage, where the jea∣lous King <HI>Charles</HI> the VIII. kept <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Or∣leans</HI> Prisoner, who, nevertheless succeeded him. In 1412, the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> brought the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Charles</HI> the VI. before <HI>Bourges,</HI> whither the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and his Confede∣rates had retir'd, and laid siege to it with an Army of 100000 Men, but in vain; for at last both Parties were glad to accept of the Medi∣ation of the Duke of <HI>Guyenn,</HI> then Dauphin of <HI>France.</HI> In 1562, The Count of <HI>Montgommery.</HI> Commander of the <HI>Protestants</HI> under the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> seiz'd on this Town <HI>May</HI> 27; but left Governour therein one <HI>Yvoy,</HI> a Man of no great Courage and Trust, who surrendered it the same Year to the Duke of <HI>Guise;</HI> and there∣fore it remained in the Power of the Leaguers,
<PB N="403" REF="178"/> till 1594, that it was reduced by the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Henry</HI> the IV.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these various Changes, <HI>Bour∣ges</HI> is still a considerable City, being of an Oval Figure, with seven Gates, and as many Suburbs. Its Walls seem to be a <HI>Roman</HI> Work, being still almost intire, and so strongly built, that it re∣quires a great deal of Labour, to pluck some few Stones out of them. It has seventeen Pa∣rochial, and seven Collegiate Churches, three Abbies, a College of Jesuites, and a vast num∣ber of Monasteries, besides the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> said to be bui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in 254, and the St. <HI>Chappel,</HI> founded by <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> Brother to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Charles</HI> the V. and therefore depending immediately on the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> That Duke was buried there in 1417, and there is still his Crown, with several Ves∣sels of Gold and Silver curiously wrought. There are likewise shewn the pretended Bones of a certain Giant call'd <HI>Briat,</HI> said to have been 15 Cubits high. The <HI>Romans</HI> had here a Pallace, which K. <HI>Pepin</HI> repair'd, and called there an Assembly of his Barons in 767; but I know not whether it be the same which the Dukes of <HI>Berry</HI> made afterward use of, and is now the Seat of the Presidial. Besides the Bai∣liwick <HI>Bourges</HI> has a Generality, to which the Elections of <HI>Chateau-Roux,</HI> and <HI>la Chastre</HI> in <HI>Berry,</HI> and St. <HI>Amand</HI> in <HI>Bourbonnois</HI> are resor∣ting; as also a Chamber of Acompts for all the lands depending on this Dutchy, erected by the said Duke in 1379. Its University is famous for the Civil and Canon Law; the best Lawyers in <HI>France</HI> having taught here in the last Age,

<P>But now I am speaking of Priviledges, I must not forget four very rare and considerable Prerogatives, granted by the <HI>French</HI> King to the Inhabitants of <HI>Bourges,</HI> perhaps in reward of their Fidelity to <HI>Charles</HI> the VII.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Chesne.</NOTE> 1.

<P>Amongst the Buildings of <HI>Bourges</HI> the Town-House, and the House of <HI>Jaques Coeur</HI> are worthy to be seen. This Man was Treasurer to <HI>Charles</HI> the VII. and one of the first that ventured to send Merchant Ships into the East. By that unknown Trade, he gather'd in a short time such vast Sums of Mony, that he bought the Lordships of St. <HI>Fergeau, Menetou, Boisi,</HI> S. <HI>Geran de Vaux, la aliPsse,</HI> &amp;c. and built a most

But his great Riches prov'd his Ruin; for the envious Courtiers took thence occasion to accuse him of keeping unlawful Correspondences with the <HI>Turks,</HI> of sending them Arms, Weapons▪ and Amunitions; and even Smiths and Gunners, to smeed, melt and point them after the Christian manner; Of discovering the Secrets of the State, make∣ing away the King's Mony, and drawing un∣lawful Taxes from <HI>Languedoc:</HI> for which true or pretended Crimes, he was put close Prison∣er, condemned to excessive Fines, and then banish'd for ever from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Ecclesiastical State, Christianity, together with Episcopacy was as it's said, plant∣ed here by one <HI>Ʋrsinus,</HI> Disciple to the Apo∣stles, who was the first Prelate of it, in the se∣cond Century. And as by the Division of the Em∣perours, <HI>August</HI> and <HI>Constantine, Aquitain</HI> be∣came the fourth Part of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> and was subdivided into three other Provinces; the First, the Second, and the Third <HI>Aquitain; Bourges</HI> being the Capital of all, its Bishop took the Title of Patriarch or Primate of <HI>A∣quitain,</HI> and had the Precedency of the Me∣tropolitans of <HI>Bourdeaux, Narbonne,</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch.</HI> This Honour having been conferr'd, or confirmed to him by <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> who rested <HI>Aquitain</HI> into a particular Kingdom, he enjoy'd it undisturbed till the Dutchy of <HI>Guyenn,</HI> and the Estates of the Counts of <HI>Toulouse</HI> were
<PB N="406" REF="180"/> torn off from the Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> for then the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Bourdeaux, Narbonne</HI> and <HI>Auch,</HI> endeavoured to free themselves from their subordination to the Primate of <HI>Bourges,</HI> as their Masters had done from their Subjection to the <HI>French</HI> Kings. Divers National Councils were kept upon this account; but the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> maintained by the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> would never yield. The most fa∣mous Assembly of Prelates, that was ever call'd to <HI>Bourges</HI> was in 1438, where the <HI>French</HI> Cler∣gy acknowledged the Council ot <HI>Basil;</HI> and ap∣proved of the <HI>Pragmatique Sanction,</HI> as did also the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> in 1459. This Consti∣tution first drawn up by <HI>Lewis</HI> the IX, correct∣ed and enlarged by the Council of <HI>Basil,</HI> con∣sisted of 23 Statutes, of which 21 had been ratified by Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> IV, Their Principal aim was; 1. To cause the Elected Bishops to be acknowledged for such before, or without their going to <HI>Rome.</HI> 2. To make the Elections of Bishops, Abbots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> free and independant from either King or Pope. 3. To pre∣fer the Authority of a General Council before that of the Pope. 4. To abolish expectative Graces, so that the Pope might not give the Survivance of a Living to any of his Favourites, <HI>Eugenius</HI> repented soon after to have yielded so s nuch, broke with the Council of <HI>Basil,</HI> and sent Ambassadours to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Charles</HI> the VII. to hinder the Reception of the <HI>Prag∣matique,</HI> but all in vain; for it subsisted till 1516. that it was suppressed by an Agreement between <HI>Francis</HI> I. and <HI>Leo</HI> X. call'd the <HI>Concor∣dat;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King allowing the Pope to in∣slave
<PB N="407" REF="180"/> his Clergy again, that he might abolish the free Elections and Name to the great Livings.</P>
<P>The Diocess of <HI>Bourges</HI> contains 900 Parishes under 12 Arch-Deacons, and 20 Arch-Priests, besides 34 Collegiate Churches, and 35 Abbies. Before the Year 1676. it had Eleven Suffragans; but <HI>Albi</HI> that was then Erected into a Metropoli∣tan took away five with it self, so that <HI>Bourges</HI> had but five left, <HI>viz. Clermons, Let,</HI> St. <HI>Flour, Tulles</HI> and <HI>Limoges.</HI> Just now I hear that the H. <HI>Chappel,</HI> and many Houses was burnt down, <HI>July</HI> 1693.</P>
<P><HI>Sancerre</HI> lies 8 Leagues North-East of <HI>Bourges,</HI> upon a Mountain wash'd by the River <HI>Loire.</HI> The <HI>Latin</HI> Name of this Town is a proof of its Antiquity; for Authors call it either <HI>Sacrum Cereris,</HI> because in the Time of Heathenism; <HI>Ceres</HI> the Goddess of Corn was ador'd there; Or <HI>Sacrum Caesaris,</HI> because <HI>Cesar</HI> sacrific'd in this Place, after his Victory over the <HI>Berruyers.</HI> Others pretend that this great General built here a Fort, to keep in the Statues or Images of his <HI>Lares</HI> or Hous-Gods; but this has little pro∣bability, since the <HI>Romans</HI> did not use to carry their domestick Gods with them in their Armies; besides that, considering the swiftness of <HI>Cesar</HI>'s Conquest, 'tis most likely he did not lose Time in building Fortresses. Another mark of the Antiquity of <HI>Sancerre</HI> is its Title of County, which it got by being given in Portion to a youngest Son of the House of <HI>Champaign. Ste∣phen,</HI> Brother to <HI>Thibauld,</HI> or <HI>Theobald</HI> the Groat, under the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the IX. <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>'s Posterity enjoy'd it to the Year 1451. that it passed to the House of <HI>Du Bucil.</HI> During that time, the Counts of <HI>Sancerre</HI> were famous,
<PB N="408" REF="181"/> and their Family produc'd many brave Men; as amongst others <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Sancerre,</HI> High-Con∣stable of <HI>France</HI> in 1397. The Neighbour∣hood of <HI>Orleans</HI> made this Town take part with the Dukes of that Name, during their Quarrels against the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> who for this reason besieg'd it. In the last Century, <HI>San∣cerre</HI> held for the Protestants, and was twice attempted in vain by the Roman Catholick Commanders, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1568 and 1572, at which time he serv'd as a place of Refuge to those In∣habitants of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Bourges,</HI> that could es∣cape the barbarous Murther of St. <HI>Bartholomew;</HI> but the following Year, it was taken by Famine, after a Siege of 8 Months. This County has 31 Chastelnies, and 500 Parishes depending on it.</P>
<P><HI>Issoudun, Ʋsellodunum,</HI> or <HI>Exoldunum,</HI> lies on the small River <HI>Thiol,</HI> seven Leagues West of <HI>Bourges.</HI> Its Gaulish termination intimates that it is an antient Town; and <HI>Du Chesne</HI> confi∣dently relates it was one of the 20, which the <HI>Gauls</HI> themselves put to Ashes to starve <HI>Cesar</HI>'s Army. What authority he has for this, I know not; but 'tis more certain that <HI>Issoudun</HI> was al∣ready a strong Place, under the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Philip August;</HI> and of such consideration, that <HI>Hugh</HI> of <HI>Die,</HI> the Pope's Legate, call'd a Synod thither in 1081. It's now a pretty large Town, the Second in this Province, surrounded with Walls, Ditches and Suburbs; defended with a Castle, and a great Tower, having several Pa∣rochial and Collegiate Churches and Monaste∣ries; a Seat of Regal Justice, or an inferior Bailiwick, resorting to the Presidial of <HI>Bourges;</HI>
<PB N="409" REF="181"/> together with many Chastelnies and Baronies its dependances. Besides that, the Wines of its Territory are said to be of good keeping, and its Trade of Wooll is considerable.</P>
<P><HI>Dun le Roy, Regio-Dunum,</HI> or <HI>Dunum Regis,</HI> is accounted the third Town of <HI>Berry,</HI> because of its Seat of Regal Justice. It lies 6 Leagues South South-East of <HI>Bourges,</HI> on the River <HI>Or∣ron,</HI> or <HI>Auron, Ʋtrio.</HI> It has had particular Lords of the Family of <HI>Astier,</HI> but was re-uni∣ted to the <HI>French</HI> Crown in 1430. under <HI>Charles</HI> the VII. and 1465. under <HI>Lewis</HI> the XI.</P>
<P><HI>Chasteau Neuf,</HI> upon the <HI>Cher,</HI> 6 Leagues South of <HI>Bourges,</HI> is a good Borrough and Castle▪ <HI>Chasteau Melan, Castrum Meliand,</HI> is six Leagues more to the South, near the River <HI>Indre.</HI> It was formerly a wall'd Town, but is now only a simple Borough; though the Castle is yet Wall'd, and has had a Tower, said to be built by the <HI>Romans. La Chastre, Castra</HI> is two Leagues Westwards on the River <HI>Indre,</HI> a little Town, but well fortified with Walls and Ditches, and defended with a good Castle. Its Church of St. <HI>Germain</HI> is together Paro∣chial and Collegiate, being serv'd with Canons, founded by the Lords of <HI>Chavigny.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chateau-Roux</HI> lies on the same River, ten Leagues West South-west of <HI>Bourges.</HI> The beginning of this Town was a Castle, built in 952, by one <HI>Radulphus Largus, Raoul the large,</HI> or <HI>the Liberal,</HI> second Lord of <HI>Deolz,</HI> who presented with it the Monks of the Abby of St. <HI>Gildas.</HI> The <HI>Latin</HI> Authors call it <HI>Castrum Radulfi,</HI> and therefore it had ought to be nam'd in <HI>French Chasteau-Raoul,</HI> or <HI>Chasteau-Roul,</HI> and not <HI>Chasteau Roux,</HI> which signifies <HI>Castrum
<PB N="410" REF="182"/> Rufum.</HI> This Town is pretty large, having 4 Parishes, a Collegiate Church, a fine Castle, and a Park belonging to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who is Lord of it; for it was erected into a Dutchy and Peerdom in 1616, by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. Here was born <HI>Odo,</HI> or <HI>Eudes</HI> of <HI>Chasteau-Roux,</HI> who became Cardinal, and made a great figure under the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the IX.</P>
<P><HI>Bourg-de-Deolz,</HI> or <HI>Bourg-Dieux, Dolensis Vi∣cus</HI> is also seated on the <HI>Indre,</HI> over against <HI>Chasteau-Roux.</HI> Its Territory is extraordinary fruitful in Wine and Wooll, because of the goodness of its Pasture-Ground; besides, that it reaches twenty Leagues in Circuit, and has above 1200 Fees, or Rear-fees depending on it; for which Reason <HI>Charles</HI> the IX. erected it into a County for the Baron of <HI>Aumont,</HI> Knight of his Order. Moreover <HI>Deolz</HI> is remarkable for an Abby of <HI>Benedictins,</HI> founded by <HI>Ebo,</HI> or <HI>Abo,</HI> a mighty Prince or Lord in <HI>Berry,</HI> Father to the forementioned <HI>Raoul;</HI> and for a Victory, which the <HI>Goths</HI> got from <HI>Riothimus,</HI> King of the <HI>Armorican Britains.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vierzon,</HI> seven Leagues North-West of <HI>Bour∣ges,</HI> on the confluence of the River <HI>Eure</HI> and <HI>Cher.</HI> It's call'd in <HI>Latin Virsio,</HI> and seated in a very fruitful Soil, amongst Rivers, Vines, green Fields and Meadows, as it is expressed in this Monkish distich.</P>
<Q><L>Virsio Villa virens, aliunde pauca requirens,</L>

<P>It was taken, and burnt by the <HI>English</HI> in 1197. <HI>Wirtzburg</HI> a City of <HI>Franceny,</HI> is call'd
<PB N="411" REF="182"/> in <HI>Latin Herbipolis,</HI> or the <HI>Green Town,</HI> from its Situation. Some derive the Name of <HI>Vierzon</HI> from the same Original, and take it for a <HI>Franco-German</HI> Colony.</P>
<P><HI>Selles,</HI> or rather <HI>Celles, Cellasti Eusicii,</HI> lies 14 Leagues West North-West of <HI>Bourges,</HI> and 15 South-West of <HI>Orleans,</HI> It's grown to an indifferent good Town, from an Anchoret's Seat: For <HI>Eusicius</HI> was an <HI>Hermit,</HI> who lived at the beginning of the 6th Century under the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Childebert</HI> the I. and had some∣times the boldness to wait upon, and advise this Prince.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Aignan</HI> upon the same River, 3 Leagues West of <HI>Celles,</HI> has the Title of a Dutchy, and bears the Name of St. <HI>Aignan,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Or∣leans,</HI> who is worshipped there, and for whom it has lost its antient Name of <HI>Chasteau Hagar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Meun Sur Yeure, Mediolanum,</HI> or <HI>Magdunum,</HI> midway betwixt <HI>Bourges</HI> and <HI>Vierzon,</HI> has an in∣ferior Bailiwick, and a Collegiate Church un∣der the Title of our Lady. It belong'd former∣ly to Count <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Artois,</HI> and the Ruins of an old Castle testify, that it was taken and de∣molished by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aubigny Albiniacum,</HI> lies upon the River <HI>Nerre,</HI> nine Leagues North of <HI>Bourges.</HI> It be∣long'd once to the Canons of St. <HI>Gratian</HI>'s of <HI>Tours,</HI> from whom <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Berry</HI> redeem∣ed it. <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. placed here a Royal Seat of Justice; but <HI>Charles</HI> the VIII. transfer'd it to <HI>Concressaut, Concurcallum,</HI> or <HI>Concorcellum</HI> (and not <HI>Concordiae Saltus,</HI> as <HI>Du Chesne</HI> feigns) having given <HI>Aubigny</HI> to <HI>Berault Steward,</HI> Capt. of his Guards, whose Issue took their Sirname
<PB N="412" REF="183"/> from thence. As to <HI>Concressant,</HI> it lies on the River <HI>Saudre,</HI> four Leagues East of <HI>Aubigny,</HI> and is only a Burrough, but fortified and adorn'd with a very fine Castle.</P>
<P><HI>Henrichemont,</HI> and <HI>Bois-Belle, Boscabellum,</HI> are two adjacent Places, situated betwixt two Forrests, near the Source of the <HI>Saudre,</HI> six Leagues North-East of <HI>Bourges.</HI> The last has a very fine Castle, and the Title of a Principality belonging to the House of <HI>Bethune-Sulli.</HI> Its Name compos'd of <HI>Henri-Richmont,</HI> seems to in∣timate an <HI>English</HI> Foundation.</P>
<P><HI>Neuvi</HI> on the River <HI>Baranion,</HI> is but an incon∣siderable Village: However it seems to be the <HI>Noviodunum,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Cesar, Lib.</HI> 7. ra∣ther than <HI>Neuvy</HI> upon the <HI>Loire,</HI> since the for∣mer is in the right way from <HI>Avaricum Bourges,</HI> to <HI>Genabum Orleans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Argenton, Argentomagus,</HI> is a Town and Chastelny upon the River <HI>Creuse,</HI> 16 Leagues South-East of <HI>Bourges.</HI> It has a Castle forti∣fied with ten Towers, upon one of which call∣ed the Tower of <HI>Heraclius,</HI> are Ingraven these two words, <HI>Veni vici,</HI> with such uncounterfeit Vestiges of Antiquity, and Ruins of old Build∣ings, that it cannot be doubted but that it's a <HI>Roman</HI> Work. Besides, that one <HI>Heraclius</HI> was Governour there under the Empire of <HI>Decius,</HI> and is said to have put to Death the 2 Martyrs St. <HI>Marcel,</HI> and St. <HI>Anastase,</HI> in the inclos'd Yard, that bears yet the Name of the latter Saint.</P>

<P>THis Province is the biggest of those that are comprehended in the Government <HI>Orleanois;</HI> for it reaches 48 Leagues East and West from <HI>Port de Piles</HI> in <HI>Tourain</HI> to the Isle of <HI>Nermoutier,</HI> and 20 North and South from <HI>Loudun</HI> to <HI>Aunay,</HI> or 26 from <HI>Champigni</HI> on the <HI>Vienne,</HI> to <HI>Marsillai</HI> on the <HI>Charante,</HI> and the Borders of <HI>Angoumois.</HI> It's included betwixt <HI>Britany, Anjou</HI> and <HI>Tourain</HI> on the North. <HI>Berri</HI> and <HI>La Marche</HI> on the East, <HI>Angoumois, Saintonge,</HI> and <HI>Aunis</HI> on the South, and the Sea on the West. It's divided into up∣per and lower, the latter extending along the Ocean from <HI>Fontenay le Comte</HI> to <HI>Mortaigne,</HI> and the former taking up the rest of the Province. The whole Country is fruitful in Corn, Wine and Pasture-Grounds, and feeds great num∣bers of Sheep, and Herds of Cattle; besides, that there is good Fishing on the Sea-Coast, and a vast quantity of Game in the Forrests and Warrens.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>POICTOƲ</HI> are mentioned by <HI>Cesar, Strabo, Ptol my,</HI> and other antient Geo∣graphers under the Name of <HI>Poictones.</HI> But there is little appearance they should have got∣ten that Name from a <HI>Scythian Nation,</HI> call'd properly <HI>Agathyrses,</HI> and sirnam'd <HI>Picti,</HI> be∣cause they used to Paint their Hair and Faces,
<PB N="415" REF="184"/> to make themselves the more terrible to their Enemies. That these <HI>Pictes</HI> having possest themselves of the Northern Parts of great <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> should have Shipp'd over a Colony, that made a Descent on the Coasts of <HI>POICTOƲ;</HI> Conquered the Country, and gave their Sirname to it. All this is grounded upon a bare Resem∣blance of Words without any Foundation on History; for theses <HI>Pictes</HI> began to appear in the Year 87. of our Lord, under the Empire a <HI>Domitian;</HI> and we have quoted <HI>Cesar,</HI> who call'd the Inhabitants of <HI>POICTOƲ, Pictones,</HI> an hun∣dred Years before: So that this must needs be a <HI>Gaulish</HI> Name, whose original is unknown, that Tongue being almost altogether lost.</P>
<P>The swiftness of <HI>Cesars</HI> Conquests in the <HI>Gauls</HI> will not surprise those who shall consider the Constitution of that Country, separated into a vast number of petty States, inde∣pending from one another. That Great Captain us'd the methods that have ever prov'd so successful to Conquerors, to sow dis∣sension among their Enemies, make Alliances with some, profer Neutrality to others, and use the Forces of the vanquished to subdue the unconquered. Thus <HI>Cesar</HI> having submitted the Inhabitants of the Country of <HI>POICTOƲ</HI> and <HI>Saintonge,</HI> imbark'd his Troops in their Vessels to Land Men into the Country of <HI>Vennes,</HI> and by those means subdued the most potent Nation that liv'd on the Sea-Coast of <HI>Gaul.</HI> Neither could the League which <HI>Vercingentorix,</HI> a young Gentleman of <HI>Auvergne,</HI> endeavoured to make among several Nations of the <HI>Celtick Gaul,</HI> restore their broken Power. The <HI>Quota</HI>
<PB N="416" REF="185"/> of the <HI>Pictones</HI> came then to 8000 Men, which shews how considerable they were in those days. Notwithstanding <HI>Alesia,</HI> whose relief was in∣tended by this League, was taken and destroyed by the <HI>Romans;</HI> the <HI>Pictones</HI> with all their Con∣federates, being likewise subdu'd. Ever since the <HI>Pictones</HI> remained under the <HI>Romans,</HI> and not long after the Emperour <HI>Claudius,</HI> going over into <HI>England,</HI> was accompanied with the Flow∣er of their Nobility, whom at his Return, he allow'd to rebuild their Capital City, in Re∣compence of their good Services. But in 410, the <HI>Vandals</HI> plundered and destroyed it in part, and two Years after, it fell with all <HI>POICTOƲ, Guienn</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> in the Power of the <HI>Wi∣sigoths,</HI> who maintained themselves in the Pos∣sesion of all those Provinces 84 Years, under six Kings, that is, till 509; that <HI>Clovis,</HI> King of the <HI>French,</HI> won the Battel of <HI>Civaux,</HI> near <HI>Poictiers,</HI> kill'd <HI>Alaric,</HI> King of the <HI>Wisigoths,</HI> and drove them out of <HI>POICTOƲ,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Guienn</HI> and <HI>Languedoc.</HI></P>
<P>Under the <HI>French</HI> King, and Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Bald, this Province began to have Counts of its own, who in process of Time beeame Dukes of <HI>Guienn. William</HI> the X. the last of them, Married <HI>Alienor,</HI> his only Daughter and Heires to the <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Lewis</HI> the VII, but the crafty Policy of the Popes procuring a Divorce betwixt them, this rich Princess spous'd <HI>Henri Plantagenet,</HI> afterwards King of <HI>England,</HI> which was the Source of continual Wars betwixt the two Kingdoms, during two or three Centuries.</P>
<PB N="417" REF="185"/>
<P><HI>Pictones</HI> is the true <HI>Latin</HI> Name of the Inha∣bitants; that has been since corrupted into <HI>Pi∣ctavi, Pictavenses</HI> and <HI>Pictavini,</HI> whence comes the French <HI>Poitevins,</HI> and likewise the Name of <HI>Petaux,</HI> given to some part of the <HI>French</HI> Foot, by <HI>Froissard</HI> and <HI>Thibaud de Maroiles,</HI> as most probably the Name of <HI>Bidaux,</HI> in the same Hi∣storians, signifies the Foot-Soldiers levied in the Province of <HI>Berry, Bituriges.</HI></P>
<P>As there are great Numbers of Gentry in this Province, and the Inhabitants of Towns are well bred, and live at Ease; the Reformation made great progresses in <HI>POICTOƲ,</HI> and was oft therefore the Seat of War in the last Age. But nothing can be compar'd to the Cruelties, which the <HI>Intendant</HI> of <HI>Marillac</HI> and his Officers exercised upon the Protestants of this Province, in the Years 1680. and 1681, by <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV's Order. The waste of their Goods, and the plunder of their Houses were tolerable Vexations, in comparison of the Racks and Tortures, which they put those poor Men upon, without any other Cause, than that they were pretended Hereticks.

<P><HI>Poictiers,</HI> Capital of the whole Province, lies forty Leagues from <HI>Orleans,</HI> and sixty five from <HI>Paris,</HI> to the South East.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Government of <HI>Guienne.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the time of <HI>Julius Caesar, Aquitain</HI> reach'd not farther than from the <HI>Garonne</HI> to the <HI>Pyrenées,</HI> that is, it only comprehended what was since call'd <HI>Novempopulana,</HI> and now <HI>Gascony.</HI> But <HI>August</HI> extended it, Limits to the <HI>Loire,</HI> so that it contain'd besides the present Government of <HI>Guienne,</HI> the Provinces of <HI>Poictou, Touraine, Berry, la Marche, Bour∣bonnois</HI> and <HI>Auvergne,</HI> and made the fourth part of the <HI>Gauls. Charlemaign</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Meek</HI> follow'd this division when they ere∣cted it into a Kingdom for their youngest Sons. Most of those Provinces were since possest by the Dukes of <HI>Guienne,</HI> fell to the <HI>English</HI> by the Marriage of the Dutchess <HI>Eleonor</HI> with <HI>Henry</HI> II. and were Conquered from them by <HI>Charles</HI> VII.</P>
<P>The Dukes of <HI>Guienne</HI> had the third rank among the twelve Ancient Peers of <HI>France.</HI> The name of <HI>Guienne</HI> is a maimed Word from the Latin <HI>Aquitaniae,</HI> that is it self deriv'd from <HI>Aquae,</HI> because there are many Springs of Warm
<PB N="444" REF="199"/> Water, whence many Cities in this Government are still call'd to this day, as we shall see here∣after.</P>
<P>This Government borders to the North upon <HI>Poictou, Angoumois</HI> and <HI>la Marche;</HI> to the East upon <HI>Auvergne</HI> and <HI>Languedoc;</HI> on the South to the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills, by which it is divided from <HI>Spain;</HI> and the West to the Ocean. It lies be∣tween 42 D. 30 Min. and 46 D. 20 Min. of Latitude, and between 18 D. and 24 D. of Longitude, which amount from the South to the North to 100 Leagues, from <HI>Aragnoet,</HI> in the <HI>Pyrenées</HI> to <HI>Niort</HI> in <HI>Poictou,</HI> and to about 112 from <HI>St. John de Luz</HI> beyond <HI>Bayo∣ne</HI> to <HI>Saint Geniez</HI> in <HI>Rouergue</HI> near <HI>Gevaudan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is pretty Fruitful in Corn, Wines, Fruits, Pastures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> except the Lands (or Sandy-grounds) near the <HI>Pyrenées,</HI> where is nothing but Heaths and Pastures that feed abundance of Cattle: The Air is there sweet and wholesom.</P>

The <HI>Garomne</HI> above all facili∣tates the Trade of Wine, Corn, Oyls, Brandy, Plums, Wooll. One may say for this Country that it has given to <HI>France</HI> brave Soldiers, and great Schollars; for it is certain, that <HI>Guienne</HI> and <HI>Languedoc</HI> get as much honour in the Armies, and the Republick of Letters, at the rest of the Kingdom besides.

<P>The <HI>French</HI> having expell'd the <HI>Goths</HI> beyond the <HI>Pyrenees, Charlemaign</HI> established Gover∣nors in <HI>Languedoc</HI> with the Title of Counts of <HI>Toulouse;</HI> of whom the first was one <HI>Corson</HI> in 778. The second was St. <HI>William du Court-Nez,</HI> or <HI>Aux Cornets,</HI> whence the Princes of <HI>Orange</HI> derive their pedigree, as may be infered from the hunting horn they bear in their Arms. This <HI>William,</HI> who lived about the year 790, foun∣ded the Abbey of St. <HI>William the Desart,</HI> in the Dioceses of <HI>Lodeve;</HI> wherein he took the Habit of Monk: After his death or retirement the State of <HI>Languedoc</HI> was very much troubled by the quarrels of the several pretenders, who ma∣king use of the weakness of the <HI>French</HI> Kings, endeavour'd to erect their Governments into Sovereign Principalities. <HI>Raimond-Pons</HI> Count of <HI>Toulouse</HI> in 907. made himself Proprietary of the Dutchy of <HI>Septimania,</HI> or Marquisate of <HI>Gothia;</HI> but not being able to subdue some particular Governours, as the Counts of <HI>Car∣cassonne, Melgueil</HI> and <HI>Foix;</HI> the Viscounts of <HI>Narbonne, Besiers, Agde, Nismes, Lodeve, Ʋzès,</HI> &amp;c. who formerly depended on the Dukes of <HI>Septimania;</HI> and would now become Sovereigns as well as themselves; the Counts of <HI>Toulouse</HI> allow'd them to enjoy their Usurpations.

These Lords being so powerful, the <HI>French</HI> Kings were glad to make them the first Counts and Peers of their Kingdom, that by this Title of honour, they should be drawn to stick the closer to the <HI>French</HI> Interest.

<P><HI>Ptolomy</HI> ascribes eight Capital Cities to the <HI>Gaulish Tectosages,</HI> viz. <HI>Toulouse, Collioure</HI> or <HI>Il∣liberis, Roussillon</HI> or <HI>Ruscino, Narbonne, Carcas∣sonne, Beziers, Cessero,</HI> esteem'd by some <HI>Castres,</HI> and by other S. <HI>Tubery,</HI> and <HI>Agde</HI> or <HI>Agatha.</HI> Speaking of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> I have observed the several changes of Masters and Governments, which <HI>Toulouse</HI> as the head of this Province has
<PB N="498" REF="225"/> undergone, so that I have but to mention, that even long after the <HI>French</HI> had conquer'd all <HI>Septimania,</HI> as under the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Meek, the <HI>Toulousan, Pagus Tolosanus,</HI> made up a distinct Country, as having been in the <HI>French</HI> hands long before the rest of <HI>Septimania.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Toulouse,</HI> and its <HI>Latin</HI> name <HI>Tolosa</HI> are very ancient, for <HI>Caesar</HI> makes mention of the <HI>Tolo∣sates;</HI> but the time of its foundation is altoge∣ther uncertain: for those who ascribe it to one <HI>Tolus,</HI> Grand-child to <HI>Japhet</HI> are fabulous Au∣thors. As it came early under the domination of the <HI>Romans;</HI> so they pleased themselves in beautifying it with several stately Buildings, as a Palace, an Amphitheater, and a Capitole, which last honour they made common with <HI>Rome</HI> to two other Towns only, <HI>viz. Narbonne,</HI> and new <HI>Carthage</HI> or <HI>Carthagena;</HI> but there are no re∣mains of any of 'em. All what we know of that of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> is, that it was dedicated to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> built in a very high place, and still in being in the middle of the XIII Century, but made use of as a Town-house; for the Senators or Magistrates assembled there in Council, as <HI>Pe∣ter Maurice</HI> Abbot of <HI>Cluny</HI> relates in a Letter against the <HI>Petrobrusians.</HI> Thence probably it is, that the Sheriffs of this City are yet call'd <HI>Capitouls.</HI> Anciently they were 24 in number, who were reduced to 12 under <HI>Alfonse</HI> of <HI>Poi∣ctiers,</HI> last Count of <HI>Toulouse</HI> 6 for the City, and as many for the Burrough, and again to 4, and then to 6 in 1390. by an Edict of the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> VI. to which two others were ad∣ded 1392, 5 for the City, and 3 for the Bur∣rough. In 1401, they were increased to 12,
<PB N="499" REF="225"/> 8 for the City, and 4 for the Burrough, but in the very same year they were again reduc'd to 8, and 2 only left to the Burrough, which di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ision has ever since subsisted.</P>
<P><HI>Aulu-Gellius</HI> relates, that <HI>Q. Servilius Cepio</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Consul, having taken and plunder'd <HI>Tou∣louse</HI> in 648 of <HI>Rome,</HI> found a great quantity of Gold in its Temples, but that all those who were partakers of this Booty, came to a Tra∣gical end. For <HI>Orosius</HI> says, that he sent this Treasure to <HI>Marseille,</HI> but caus'd all the Leaders to be put to death in the way, that he alone might enjoy it; which perfidious cruelty so meens'd the <HI>Romans</HI> against him; already in∣rag'd at his having been defeated by the <HI>Cim∣bres,</HI> that they confiscated his Goods, and bought Lands of it for the People. As for him he dy'd most miserably in Exile, whence came the Proverb <HI>habet aurum Tolosanum;</HI> he has of <HI>Toulouse</HI>'s Gold, said of such whose riches did not prosper. <HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> assures, that this Booty was found in Marshes, and consisted in Wedges of Gold and Silver 15000 Talents worth; <HI>Orosius</HI> fixes it to the value of 100000 Found in Gold, and 110000 in Silver; but <HI>Ju∣stin</HI> increases it to 110000 Pound of Gold, and 5000000 of Silver; and adds, that it was the plunder which the <HI>Tectosages</HI> brought home from the expedition of <HI>Delphos;</HI> which last ac∣count is altogether fabulous, since such of the <HI>Tectosages,</HI> who went into <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> ne∣ver returned back to their own Country, having either been kill'd or settled themselves there, as <HI>Polybius, Pausanias, Livy,</HI> and all the ancient Authors testifie. So that the matter of fact is
<PB N="500" REF="226"/> true, <HI>viz.</HI> that there was a vast quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gold and Silver, in, or about <HI>Toulouse,</HI> which was taken away by <HI>Cepio,</HI> but it remains doubt∣ful whence it came; whether it had been ex∣tracted out of Mines they had in their Country, or gathered up through the course of many years by this industrious and warlike People, averse to Luxury and Expences, as <HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> qualifies them.</P>
<P><HI>Toulouse</HI> has twice had the honour to be the head of a Kingdom, under the <HI>Wisigoths</HI> before <HI>Clovis,</HI> and under <HI>Charibert,</HI> to whom <HI>Dagobert</HI> his Brother King of <HI>France,</HI> yielded the <HI>Tolosa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Quercy, Agenois, Perigord, Saintonge</HI> and <HI>Gas∣cony.</HI> As to the State of the Church, though the Cathedral be dedicated under the name of S. <HI>Stephen;</HI> yet S. <HI>Saturnin</HI> is thought to have been the first Bishop of it in the second Age, and to have been precipitated by the Heathens headlong the Capitole. Pope <HI>John</HI> XXII. ere∣cted this City into an Archbishoprick in 1317. and submitted to it the Bishoprick of <HI>Pamiez,</HI> with six Monasteries that he chang'd into Epis∣copal Sees, <HI>viz. Montauban, Rieux, Mirepoix, la Vaur, Lombez,</HI> and <HI>S. Papoul,</HI> of which the 5 last were formerly included within this Dio∣cese.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Toulouse</HI> was instituted by the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Philip the Fair,</HI> in 1302, and made sedentary by <HI>Charles</HI> VII. in 1442, or 1443, who subjected to it, all Upper and Lower <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and the 3 Countries of the <HI>Cevennes,</HI> besides some part of <HI>Guyenne</HI> and <HI>Gascony,</HI> as <HI>Quercy, Rouergue, Cominges, Gaure, Armagnac, Estrac, Lomaigne, Magnoac</HI> and <HI>Bigorre.</HI> This,
<PB N="501" REF="226"/> if we believe <HI>Du Chesne,</HI> was occasioned by a difference between the King and <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix,</HI> Count of <HI>Chastelbon,</HI> Husband to <HI>Jane</HI> Daughter to the Earl of <HI>Cominges</HI> and <HI>Boulogne.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Monarch pretended to be Heir to that Lady, and on that account he summoned them both to appear before his Parliament of <HI>Toulouse</HI> in 1442, and at the same time fixed there the Seat of that Sovereign Court.</P>
<P>Besides the Parliament, there is an Office of Chancery, a Seneschalship and Presidial, whose Chief justice is call'd <HI>Juge-Mage,</HI> a <HI>Viguery,</HI> that is the same Court, which on this side the <HI>Loire</HI> is call'd <HI>Prevoté</HI> or <HI>Provostship;</HI> General Trea∣surers, and a Receiver General of the King's <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nesne.</HI> Add to this the Court of the <HI>Capi∣touls;</HI> who judg of all such things as belong to <HI>Police</HI> or the City Government; as appears by that they have lately condemned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the</HI> Journal des Savans Dec. 22. 1692. <HI>This happen'd on the</HI> 21 <HI>of</HI> July 1691.</NOTE> a pretended <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI> but a real Woman, born in 1669, and call'd <HI>Margaret Mallaure,</HI> to be from hence∣forth cloath'd as a Man, and to bear the name of <HI>Antony Mallaure;</HI> because when she became 14 years of Age, it was given out, that she had more of the Man than of the Woman.

<L>Quos genuit cunctos gremio complexa colonos.</L></Q>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">I shall never forget <HI>Toulouse,</HI> wherein I have been educated, whose large circuit is surroun∣ded with Brick-walls, and wash'd with the fine River <HI>Garonne;</HI> which is inhabited by a numberless People, whose Borders reach near the Snow of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> and the Pine-trees of the <HI>Cevennes,</HI> being seated between <HI>Aqui∣tain</HI>
<PB N="503" REF="227"/> and <HI>Spain;</HI> which, when four Cities shall flock out of it, it shall not feel the loss, nor be exhausted of People, if it but keep such Inhabitants as are born within its bo∣som.</Q></P>
<P>If this be the true sense, as it seems the most natural to me, <HI>Toulouse</HI> was doubtless one of the greatest Cities in the <HI>Gaules. Adrian de Valois</HI> pretends that these <HI>quadruplices Ʋrbes</HI> are four Countries, which had <HI>newly modo</HI> been added to the <HI>Toulousan,</HI> but he neither names them, nor gives any proof for it. Besides that, the Poet does not speak, as he supposes, in an absolute sense, or say that <HI>Toulouse</HI> has but late∣ly set out four Cities; on the contrary, his ex∣pressions are hypothetical, <HI>cum essuderit,</HI> that though it should happen so, however it would hardly feel the loss, provided it should keep <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>do complexa fuerit,</HI> its native Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> used to solemnize <HI>Floral Games,</HI> at the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> in honour of the God∣dess <HI>Flora,</HI> but accompany'd with very disho∣nest shews: Those that the <HI>Toulousaans</HI> still ce∣lebrate, under that name, and at the same time, are only attended with such circumstances as are most proper to stir up vertue and ingenuity. A President and 4 Counsellors of the High Court of Parliament, with the eight <HI>Capitouls,</HI> and the other Magistrates of the City, come in their Nobes on the 1. of <HI>May,</HI> into the Council-hall, to hear the Poets recite their Verses; and on the 3d. day after a sumptuous Treat, and a Sonnet to be made immediately by the preten∣ders to the Prizes, who are included to that effect in a great Hall, these Prizes are distributed
<PB N="504" REF="228"/> by the plurality of Votes. They are three in num∣ber, and consist in so many golden Flowers each of the value of about 14 Pound; the first is a <HI>Columbine,</HI> call'd by the <HI>French Ancolie,</HI> and by the <HI>Languedocians, Eglantine;</HI> the second i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Mary-gold, and the third a Violet. The in∣stitution of those Games is variously reported <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some ascribe it to a great Lady call'd <HI>Clemence Isaure,</HI> who bequeathed the greatest pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of her Estate to the Town-house upon that account, and whose Statue of white Marble is yet to be seen in the great Hall; but the Registers of <HI>Tou∣louse</HI> attribute it to seven Noble-men in 1324. Howsoever it be, this Solemnity is not only lau∣dable, but even worthy to be imitated by Prin∣ces, Commonwealths, and great Cities; for be∣sides that it would give an honest diversion and emulation to the ingenious; it would be as a Touch-stone to know the several degrees and abilities of understanding Men; for extraordi∣nary Poets are for the most part uncommon Genius's, and might successfully be employ'd in weightier undertakings.</P>
<P><HI>Toulouse</HI> is divided into two parts by the Ri∣ver <HI>Garonne,</HI> and into 8 Wards in reference to its 8 <HI>Capitouls.</HI> The first is the <HI>Daurade,</HI> so call'd from a very ancient Church under the name of our Lady, that was formerly a Tem∣ple of the Sun. This Precinct comprehends several Churches, Monasteries and Colleges, the Pest-house, and the Suburb of S. <HI>Cyprian</HI> with the great Hospital of S. <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>The second Ward bears the name of S. <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> the Metropolitan Church, built in a great Market, adorn'd with a fountain, upon which is
<PB N="505" REF="228"/> rais'd a fine <HI>Obelisque.</HI> In 1609. this Church was all burn'd except that part, which is call'd the Cloyster, and has 'till some Gothick Sta∣tues of half emboss'd work. It has since been rebuilt statelier than before, with a great and high Tower, wherein hangs the Bell <HI>Ardaillac,</HI> which is so very big that they dare not ring it, lest the Belfrey should fall; besides 14 vaulted Chappels round about the Quire: There are al∣so the Archbishop's Palace, the Town-house or <HI>Capitole,</HI> adorn'd with the Pictures of the En∣tries of the <HI>French</HI> Kings within <HI>Toulouse,</HI> and of the <HI>Capitouls</HI> in their Robes, the Arsenal, the Chappels of the white and blew Penitents, with several Churches, Convents, and Colleges.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old-Bridge</HI> gives its name to the third Ward, and is but a course piece of Building, worthier of the <HI>Goths</HI> than of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The New-bridge which is far finer, doth hardly yield to that of <HI>Paris;</HI> and no wonder since it was begun in 1544, and but ended about the middle of this Age. In this Precinct are the Exchange, the Court of the Provost, and <HI>Consuls</HI> of Merchants, and the Cage wherein Blasphemers are included to be drown'd into the <HI>Garonne.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth Ward, call'd <HI>La Pierre,</HI> or <HI>the Stone,</HI> has nothing considerable. The fifth takes its name from the Church <HI>Dalbade,</HI> en∣joy'd by the Fathers of the <HI>Oratory,</HI> since the year 1620. There are besides the <HI>Inquisition;</HI> a place well known by the cruelties against the <HI>Albigeois,</HI> near which is a round Castle, esteem'd by <HI>Du Chesne</HI> to be a remainder of the ancient
<PB N="506" REF="229"/> Capitole; the Island S. <HI>Antony</HI> form'd by the <HI>Garonne,</HI> and inhabited by Handicraft-men.</P>
<P>The sixth Ward call'd S. <HI>Pierre des Cuisines,</HI> has among other Churches and Monasteries, that of the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Observantins,</HI> which exceeds all the rest in bigness and sum∣ptuosity, but is especially renowned for a <HI>Cave,</HI> which consumes Dead-bodies, without anointing the Skin, and displacing the Joynts. Here is the University, with the College of <HI>Foix,</HI> founded by <HI>Peter</HI> Cardinal of <HI>Foix,</HI> and endow'd with two Libraries, one of Mss. and the other of Printed Books, that of <HI>Narbonne,</HI> founded by <HI>Gambert</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Arles</HI> and <HI>Narbonne</HI> in 1342, that of <HI>L'Equille,</HI> begun in 1561, and ended 1608 at the expences of the Town, for teaching the <HI>Hebrew, Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues. Here are also the Mills of the <HI>Basacle,</HI> whose Workmanship is esteem'd one of the greatest curiosities of <HI>Toulouse.</HI> This place, in <HI>Latin Vadaculum,</HI> that is small foord, gives likewise its name to a Bridge and a gate, hard by the Castle.</P>
<P>The seventh Ward call'd S. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> has the <HI>Castle Narbonnoise,</HI> which was the ordi∣nary Residence of the Counts of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> and a very strong place before K. <HI>Charles</HI> VII. Now it is the Palace of the Parliament, with the Hall of the Pleas, the Marble-Table, the Pri∣sons call'd <HI>Hauts-murats,</HI> the Court of the Ex∣chemier and the Mint, where Money is coyn'd and mark'd at the Letter M.</P>
<P>The eighth Ward, under the name of S. <HI>Ser∣nin</HI> or <HI>Saturnin,</HI> an ancient Collegiate Church, defended by Guns at the top of it, so plac'd,
<PB N="507" REF="229"/> that none of the many Pillars, which under∣prop the Building, can cover a Man from their Shot. This they do because of the great Treasure, that is included in this Church, for there are above 50 Silver-skreens wash'd over with Gold, besides the Jewels and Church-orna∣ments. Here are the Tombs of the ancient Counts of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> of its Prelates and Nobility.</P>
<P>Five Miles North-West of this City lies the Village or Lordship of <HI>Pibrac,</HI> which I mention here, for having giv'n its name to a <HI>Toulousan</HI> Gentleman, <HI>Gui du Faur</HI> Lord of <HI>Pibrac,</HI> Presi∣dent of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and Ambassa∣dor of <HI>France</HI> to the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> and then to <HI>Poland,</HI> under <HI>Charles</HI> IX. and <HI>Hen.</HI> III. He has left, several loose Discourses and pieces of Poetry, but the most renown'd are his Mo∣ral Quatrains, which for their brevity, majesty, and if I may so speak, sententiousness, may still challenge the first place, among all which has been written in this kind by uninspired Men. It appears by several passages of this golden Book, that the Author was not at all addicted to the Superstitions of <HI>Rome,</HI> though he never publickly embraced the Reformation, no more than divers other Great and Learned Men of his time, who seem'd to approve of the Doctrine, but did not like the manner of propogating it.</P>
<P>Seven Miles South-west of <HI>Toulouse</HI> lies the Village of <HI>Plaisance,</HI> so call'd from the goodness of its Air, Soyl, and Situation. <HI>Adrian de Va∣lois</HI> supposes it to be the <HI>Vernus Sol</HI> of <HI>Aethicus,</HI> but I rather take it for a place call'd <HI>Vernouse,</HI>
<PB N="508" REF="230"/> which lies just 15 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles South-west of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> as the <HI>Vernus Sol</HI> of that Geographer.</P>
<P>I find nothing considerable of the other pla∣ces of this Diocese, as <HI>Montoriol, Vieille Toulouse, S. Jori, Columiers, Castel-moron, Ville-Longue, Ville-neuve, Montagut, Montgaillard, Verseuil, Lenta, Carmain,</HI> with the title of a County.</P>

<P><HI>MOntauban, Mons Albanus,</HI> is one of the 6 Bishopricks of Pope <HI>John</HI> XXII's erection. It was formerly a Monastery founded by <HI>Theo∣dard</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Narbonne,</HI> and when it was made a Cathedral, the Abbot <HI>Bertrand du Puy</HI> was the first Bishop of it. As to the Town, it was but at the beginning a very strong Ca∣stle, which in process of time increas'd into a considerable City by the fertility of its Soyl, and the conveniency of its Situation upon a Hill, and the Rivers <HI>Tescounot</HI> and <HI>Tarn,</HI> on the high way from <HI>Toulouse</HI> to <HI>Limoges,</HI> and thence to <HI>Paris.</HI> It was built or repair'd in 1144, and united to the <HI>French</HI> King's <HI>Domesne</HI> in 1171▪ to whom <HI>Amaury</HI> Count of <HI>Montfort</HI> yielded since his pretensions. <HI>Montauban</HI> is divided into three parts, the old Town along the <HI>Tarn, Ville-Bourbon</HI> on the other side of that River in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> which is joyn'd to the old Town by a brick Bridge.

The Protestants were Masters of <HI>Montauban,</HI> from 1562 to 1621, that it was taken from them by <HI>Lew.</HI> XIII. They had here an <HI>Aca∣demy</HI> or College for Languages and Divinity, and it was one of the surety's Towns, which <HI>Henry</HI> IV. yielded to them. But Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> designing to run down all the orders of the Realm, began by asking from the Pro∣testants, to deliver their Towns of surety, which they justly denying; <HI>Montauban</HI> was twice be∣sieg'd in vain; but at last discord creeping a∣mongst 'em, and being betray'd by some great ones; as the Duke of <HI>Lesdiguieres,</HI> it was taken at the third Siege, and its strong Fortifications raz'd in 1629. <HI>Montauban</HI> has an Election and a generality of Treasurers, on which the Ele∣ctions of <HI>Cahors</HI> and <HI>Figeac</HI> are depending. Be∣tween the City and the Suburb of S. <HI>Antony</HI> is a fine Fountain call'd <HI>Griphon,</HI> that has 10 Pipes, and furnishes all the Inhabitants with water.

<P>I have observ'd in the first part of this Book, how the Disciples of <HI>Vigilantius,</HI> spread in
<PB N="514" REF="233"/> <HI>Guyenne</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> were for a long time as a Bank, that stopp'd the overflowing supersti∣tion. But when this Torrent grew so strong, that this Barrier prov'd too weak, God rais'd, new Defensors to his Church. At the begin∣ning of the XII. Century, <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Bruys,</HI> a Na∣tive of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> Preached and writ success∣fully against the prevailing Errors, and was hap∣pily seconded by <HI>Henry,</HI> a Monk of <HI>Toulouse.</HI> The Papists had recourse to their usual Arms, Fire and Sword, by which means they both got the Crown of Martyrdom. But their Blood prov'd, as well as that of the first Christians, the Seed of the true Church; so that after the Dispersion of <HI>Valdo</HI>'s Disciples about 1160, some of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em retiring in those parts, they were kind∣ly receiv'd. The vulgar had so good an Opi∣nion of them, that they commonly call'd them <HI>les Bons Hommes; the Good Men,</HI> and even <HI>Ray∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> the old Count of <HI>Toulouse, Peter</HI> King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> the Counts of <HI>Foix, Comminges</HI> and the Viscounts of <HI>Bearn</HI> spoused their Cause. And as Error and Vice are always timorous, so the Popes began to fear that their fatal day was come, and publish'd a <HI>Croisade</HI> against those pretended Hereticks, as though they had been Heathens or Mahometans. The <HI>Albigeois,</HI> under the Wings of their Lords and Protectors defended themselves almost an Age, but at last they were over-pow'red by the number, the <HI>French</HI> King's catching hold of that opportunity, to deprive those petty Soveraigns of their Principalities. Then it was that such as had escap'd the Sword in the Field of Battel, fell in the bloody hands of the Inquisitors, who at long run made an
<PB N="516" REF="234"/> end of them; however not so, as wholly to root the seeds of the truth out of their heart, which sprouted out again, when our first Reformers appear'd in the last Age; for then the Provinces of <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Guienne,</HI> the ancient Seat of the <HI>Albigeois,</HI> produced more Converts than all the others of <HI>France</HI> taken together.</P>
<P>We have hardly any Account of the <HI>Albi∣geois,</HI> then by such as were their sworn Enemies, Accusers, or rather Executioners; so that upon the plain confession of Popish Authors, that the <HI>Albigeois</HI> held almost all the same Doctrines with the <HI>Protestants,</HI> and that they rejected the same Superstitions, for which the last are still divided from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> we might look as Calumnies some <HI>Manichean</HI> Tenets as∣crib'd to them, as to deny the Divinity of the Old Testament, to admit a good and a bad Principle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But to clear these Christian Hero's for ever, we have but to observe that the <HI>Manicheans</HI> having been banish'd the East by the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours, they first spread them∣selves into <HI>Germany;</HI> thence they passed into <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> where meeting with a People averse from Persecution, they▪ readily crept and skulk'd amongst them; and the malicious Inquisitors catching some of these Hereticks, took hold of this occasion to defame the true <HI>Albigeois.</HI> The R.

The <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Phi∣lip the Fair</HI> did not like this election, and gave the Bishoprick to one <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Provence,</HI> who dy'd in 1298: After his death he consented to the reinstallation of <HI>Saisseti;</HI> but was so in∣cens'd at a Speech this Prelate made to him, that he caus'd him to be arrested in 1301, and put under the guard of its Metropolitan the Archbishop of <HI>Narbonne,</HI> who was then at Court.

<P><HI>Well met, mighty healthful</HI> Narbonne, <HI>thou that art renown'd both for thy Town and Terri∣tory, for thy Walls, Citizens, Circuit, Taverns, Gates, Galleries, Palace, Amphitheatre, Temples, Capitole, Mint, Bathes, Arches, Granaries, Shambles, Meadows, Fountains, Islands, Salt-pits,
<PB N="530" REF="241"/> Ponds, River, Merchandizes, Bridges and Sea. Thou art the only City that may by right present those Gods with offrands,</HI> Bacchus, Ceres, Pales, Minerve, <HI>with Vine-branches, Ears of Corn, Hay, Tapestries,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Du Chesne</HI> adds, that the <HI>Romans</HI> had built there Aqueducts besides, and erected publick Schools much like to our Universities. We are apt to imagine that the only design of these Conquerors of the World was to shew their Magnificence, and withal the Greatness and Power of their Empire: But, if I am not mi∣staken, these shrewd Politicians had a farther insight. <HI>Cicero</HI> says, that they had planted that Colony, as a Watch-Town, and a Rampier, or a Fence of the <HI>Roman</HI> People against the Na∣tives: <HI>Specula Populi Romani ac propugnacu∣lum istis ipsis Nationibus oppositum &amp; objectum.</HI> And lest the new Inhabitants should contract too great a familiarity with the ancient, care was taken to raise those of <HI>Roman</HI> Original so far above the <HI>Gauls,</HI> that they should endea∣vour to keep up their grandure by a constant Union with the head of the Empire. Since they had began to follow this method; we read but of few Rebellions in their new and yearly conquests, and of a fewer in their Fo∣reign Plantations. Contrariwise they erected on their side publick Monuments of their gra∣titude to their Benefactors; such was the Al∣tar our <HI>Narbonenses</HI> built to <HI>Cesar August,</HI> after his Death, and <HI>Apotheosis,</HI> and the sacrifices they instituted in his honour, whose Laws were in∣graven in Capital Letters, on a Marble-table, that is yet subsisting. The chief of them were
<PB N="531" REF="241"/> that on the 23. of <HI>September,</HI> the day that <HI>August</HI> was proclaim'd Emperor, as also on the first of <HI>January,</HI> and the 7 of <HI>June,</HI> three <HI>Roman Plebeian</HI> Knights, and three Freemen,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Libertini</HI> Sons to Slaves made free.</NOTE> should each of them offer Sacrifices, and furnish the Plantation, and other Inhabitants with Wine and Frankincense of their own.</P>
<P>Some fabulous Authors pretend that <HI>Narbonne</HI> was built by a <HI>Gaulish</HI> King, call'd <HI>Narbon;</HI> but it appears that this name is not much older than the <HI>Romans</HI> time; since this Country was an∣ciently inhabited by the <HI>Bebryces,</HI> a Nation con∣fining on the <HI>Iberians</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as <HI>Stepha∣nus</HI> has it, whose testimony is confirmed by that of <HI>Marcianus,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>In</HI> Pe∣riplo Galliae.</NOTE> who speaks of the <HI>Maritime Bebryces,</HI> Neighbours to the <HI>Ligurians,</HI> and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Cities of <HI>Gaul,</HI> that is, to the Coasts of <HI>Marseille</HI> and <HI>Genoa. Rufus Festus Avienus,</HI> de∣scribing the Southern Coast of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> says, that it was all possest by the <HI>Bebryces,</HI> and that <HI>Narbonne</HI> was then the head of a powerful King∣dom, which reach'd according to <HI>Ausonius</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Descr. Ill. Civit.</NOTE> from <HI>Franche-Comté</HI> to the <HI>Pyrenées,</HI> North and South, and from the <HI>Cevennes</HI> to <HI>Aquitain</HI> East, and West. <HI>Tzetses</HI> in his Commentaries on <HI>Lyco∣phron</HI> relates out of <HI>Dion,</HI> that those who are now call'd <HI>Narbonnesians,</HI> had formerly the name of <HI>Bebryces,</HI> and that the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains, which separate <HI>Spain</HI> from <HI>Gaul</HI> belong'd to them; whereupon the Poet <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> has grounded this Fable, that <HI>Pyrene</HI> Daughter to King <HI>Bebryx,</HI> whom <HI>Hercules</HI> got with Child, going to <HI>Spain</HI> through <HI>Gaul,</HI> gave her name to
<PB N="532" REF="242"/> these Mountains. It seems that the <HI>Bebryces,</HI> who inhabited part of <HI>Bithynia</HI> were issued from this <HI>Gaulish</HI> People, whom this Plantation weak∣ned so much, that the <HI>Tectosages</HI> master'd their Country, or made it Tributary, whence it came that in process of time they lost their ancient Name as well as their Empire; for in <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Age, they were only known as a part of the <HI>Tectosages.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Narbonne</HI> remained faithful to the <HI>Romans</HI> till the utmost decay of the Western Empire, in 435, that it was besieg'd by the <HI>Goths,</HI> under their King <HI>Theodoric.</HI> It then made a conside∣rable resistance; but in 462. Count <HI>Agrippin</HI> its Governour, envying the prosperous successes of <HI>Aegidius,</HI> or <HI>Gillon</HI> Chief Commander of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Militia in the <HI>Gauls,</HI> delivered this City in∣to the Enemies hands. The <HI>Goths</HI> were con∣tent with the demolishing of its Walls, and preserv'd its other Monuments of Antiquity; but the barbarous <HI>Huns,</HI> who took it some time after, destroy'd them all. Notwithstanding, it recover'd still part of its former lustre, and when the <HI>Saracens</HI> took and plunder'd it, in 732, it was become again the finest, the most famous, and the Capital of that Country, if we may believe <HI>Aimoin;</HI> but <HI>Charles Martel,</HI> who retook it not long after, made a greater havock in all <HI>Lower Languedoc</HI> than the Enemies them∣selves.</P>
<P>However of all the mischiefs <HI>Narbonne</HI> has been expos'd to, the most sensible seems to be the unworthy treatment it receiv'd from <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Montfort,</HI> who by the help of numerous <HI>Croi∣sades,</HI> having at last got the better of <HI>Raimond</HI>
<PB N="533" REF="242"/> Count of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> and his Vassals and Confede∣rates, ordered the Inhabitants of <HI>Narb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nne</HI> to throw down their own Walls, which they were forc'd to do for fear of the worst.</P>
<P>As to the Civil Government, we have hinted how this City was at first the head of a King∣dom under the <HI>Bebryces,</HI> then subject to the <HI>Tectosages,</HI> and afterwards to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who made it the Capital of, and gave its name to the fourth part of <HI>Gaule,</HI> call'd from hence <HI>Gallia Narbonnensis,</HI> and since subdivided into 5. Provinces, the 1 and 2 <HI>Narbonnoise,</HI> the <HI>Vi∣ennoise,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Alps, and the <HI>Maritini</HI> Alps, that is, all <HI>Savoy, Dauphiné, Provence, Lower Languedoc, Roussillon,</HI> the <HI>Toulousan,</HI> and the County of <HI>Foix.</HI> During the decay of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, under the second race of their Kings, the Dukes of <HI>Septimania,</HI> took upon them the Title of Dukes of <HI>Narbonne,</HI> as did likewise the Counts of <HI>Toulouse</HI> their Successors; but the following Lords of this Town and ad∣jacent Territories, contented themselves with the Name of Viscounts, which they bore from 1134 to 1507. that <HI>Gaston</HI> of <HI>Foix</HI> last Viscount of <HI>Narbonne</HI> exchang'd it for other Lands with the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. his Uncle.</P>
<P>If we believe the Tradition of the most cre∣dulous of Roman Catholick Authors, the Pro∣consul <HI>Sergius Paulus</HI> converted by the Apostle of that name, was the first Preacher of Christia∣nity at <HI>Narbonne,</HI> and consequently its first Bi∣shop. But though this Tradition be uncertain, this Church is however of a great antiquity; and there are plausible proofs, that it has been a Metropolitan from the time of <HI>Constantine</HI> the
<PB N="534" REF="243"/> Great in 309. and though the erection of <HI>Tou∣louse</HI> into an Archbishoprick, has restrain'd its Jurisdiction into narrower Limits; yet it has still ten Suffragans, <HI>viz. Beziers, Agde, Lodeve, Maguelonne,</HI> now at <HI>Montpellier, Nismes, Ʋsez, Carcassonne, Elne,</HI> now at <HI>Perpignan, S. Pons de Tomieres,</HI> and <HI>Alet.</HI></P>
<P>This City has been much bigger and larger than it is now, as appears by the ruins of the Palace of the <HI>Gaulish</HI> Kings, that are with∣out the Town. However it is still considerable, especially for its Fortifications, which render it one of the Keys of <HI>France,</HI> on this side the <HI>Pyrenees.</HI> In <HI>Pliny</HI>'s time, it was seated upon the River <HI>Aude,</HI> twelve <HI>Italian</HI> Miles South of the Sea, but is now nine or ten Miles only distant from it, which shews, that either the Sea has not gain'd upon the Land, or that this City has been rebuilt near the Shore. It is properly the <HI>Aude,</HI> that goes through <HI>Narhonne,</HI> and divides it into two Parts, the City and the Burough, but a Channel drawn from it, call'd <HI>La Robine.</HI> The Cathedral Church under the Name of St. <HI>Just,</HI> and St. <HI>Saviour</HI> is renowned for it's Or∣gans, and the Picture of <HI>Lazarus</HI> rising from the dead. There are 5 Parishes besides, of which the most famous is the Collegiate of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> The whole Diocese contains 4 Archdeaconships, that of <HI>Narbonne, Corbieres, Le Razès</HI> and <HI>Fe∣nouillet,</HI> an Abby of <HI>Augustinians,</HI> call'd <HI>Our Lady of forty Notre-Dame de quarante,</HI> another of <HI>O∣sternians,</HI> under the name of <HI>Notre-Dame de la Fon-frede,</HI> Our Lady of the cold Fountain, and several Monasteries. The Palace of the Arch∣bishop is not that of the Kings of the <HI>Wisigoths</HI>
<PB N="535" REF="243"/> or <HI>Westgoths,</HI> which was demolish'd in 1451. Hard by, at a place call'd <HI>Pontsorme,</HI> are the re∣mains of an ancient Bridge built by the <HI>Ro∣mans.</HI> The Air hereabouts is not extraordinary wholsom.</P>
<P><HI>Leucate, Leucata,</HI> keeps still its ancient name that was given it, as it seems, by the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Marseille</HI> a Colony of the <HI>Phoceans,</HI> be∣cause of the whiteness of the steep and naked Rocks wherewith it is environ'd, for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies <HI>white</HI> and <HI>glistering.</HI> Round about the Hill, which is the Seat of <HI>Leucate,</HI> lies a Pond in the form of a <HI>Peninsule;</HI> so that this Town is very strong by Nature. <HI>Francis</HI> I. built there a Fort to which other Fortifications having been since added; <HI>Serbellon</HI> General of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> besieg'd it in vain, and was defeated by the Governor of <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nguedoc, Charles</HI> of <HI>Schom∣berg</HI> Duke of <HI>Halluyn, September</HI> 29 1637.</P>
<P>The other Towns or considerable Burroughs of this Diocese are, <HI>Capestan, Caput-stagni</HI> so call'd, because it's seated at the head of a Pond, wherein the <HI>Aude</HI> discharges it self, <HI>Colombier, Puy-serguier Podium Sericarium,</HI> North-East of <HI>Narbonne; Rieux, Azillac</HI> and <HI>Lesignan</HI> on the North-West; <HI>Bages, Peyriac, Ville-Salce</HI> and <HI>Sigean</HI> on the South, the second and last of these have Salt-pits; four Leagues and a half North of <HI>Narbonne,</HI> and five West of <HI>Bezuil,</HI> lies a Village nam'd <HI>Quarante,</HI> at the foot of a Moun∣tain, whence both Towns may be discover'd; which has given occasion to this pleasant equi∣vocation, the one may see <HI>quarante &amp; deux Villes,</HI> forty and two Towns. <HI>Quarante</HI> the name of that Village signifying <HI>forty.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Carcassonne, Carcasso</HI> or <HI>Carcassum Volcarum Tectosagum,</HI> above 13 Leagues West of <HI>Nar∣bonne,</HI> and almost 20 South-East of <HI>Toulouse.</HI> It's seated upon the River <HI>Aude,</HI> which divides into two parts, the Town and the City, both wall'd in, and joyn'd by a Stone-bridge, but having each their particular Magistrates and Government. The City is higher than the Town, and incompassed with a double Wall, Towers, and deep Moats. It has a Castle with a Garrison kept by the King in ordinary pay, a Presidial-seat, and the first Seneschalship of the Province. Both parts of <HI>Carcassonne</HI> make together a pretty big City, which seems some∣what ancient, by reason of the old Mss. Acts that are found there, written on the bark of Trees, on fine Linnen and the like stuff; be∣sides the great many old weapons, Harnesses, and other Warlike Engines that are in its Ar∣senal. That part which is called the Town is built along the River, and though most of the Houses he made of Wood, yet they give a fine prospect, because the Streets are strait-right, and end at a Square, whence the 4 Gates of the Town may be discover'd. It is surrounded with Bastions and Rampiers, that make it capable of some defence. The Chief Trade of the Inha∣bitants consists in Box-combs, Serges, and Cloaths, whereof there are several Manufactures. The Bishoprick is not so ancient as the City, for the old Notices of the <HI>Gauls</HI> do not mention it; and the first Prelate of <HI>Carcassonne</HI> that we find upon record, is one <HI>Sergius,</HI> who subscrib'd in that quality to a Council held at <HI>Narbonne,</HI> in 590, the 4th year of <HI>Recarede</HI> King of the
<PB N="537" REF="244"/> <HI>Westgoths:</HI> Whereas <HI>Pliny, Ptolomy,</HI> and the Tables of the Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI> speak of the City, whose Cathedral is dedicated to S. <HI>Nazaire.</HI> The <HI>Gottish</HI> Monarchs had extraordinary fortify'd this Town, in which they kept their treasure, and as 'tis pretended the spoils of <HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> besieg'd it in vain, after they had routed <HI>Ala∣ric</HI> in 507, but <HI>Gontran</HI> King of <HI>Orleance,</HI> ha∣ving taken it by intelligence, was forced to re∣tire and leave it, having received a notable o∣verthrow from King <HI>Recarede</HI> in 587 or 588. However the <HI>French</HI> having at last expell'd the <HI>Wisigoths</HI> beyond the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> became absolute Masters of <HI>Carcassonne.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Charles the Bald</HI> gave it to <HI>Bernard</HI> II. Count of <HI>Tou∣louse</HI> in 871, but 'tis not certain who were his Successors till the year 974. that <HI>Arnauld</HI> Count of <HI>Carcassonne</HI> was succeeded by several other during above two Centuries. The extinction of that family, or the loss of their Soveraignty came from the protection <HI>Raymond Roger,</HI> the last Count gave to the <HI>Albigeois;</HI> for the <HI>Croi∣sado</HI>'s Army incens'd at it, besieg'd and took <HI>Carcassonne</HI> in 1209, the Council of <HI>Latran</HI> ap∣prov'd of, and confirm'd this Usurpation in 1215, and invested <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Montfort</HI> with the Estates of the depriv'd Count. However <HI>Amau∣ry</HI> his Son not being able to keep his Father's Conquests, yielded them to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> VIII. in 1222, and in 1247 <HI>Raimond Trin∣cavel</HI> the true Heir and Lord of <HI>Carcassonne,</HI> as only Son to <HI>Raymond Roger,</HI> yielded likewise his lawful pretensions to <HI>Lewis</HI> IX.</P>

Its Prelate is Lord of the Town, which is neither big nor thick inhabi∣ted; but has this considerable, that it lies near the Spring of a River call'd <HI>La jaur,</HI> which at its very source is so great as to move several Mills, and having wash'd divers Villages dis∣charges it self into the <HI>Orbe.</HI> S. <HI>Pons de Tomie∣res</HI> stands almost 11 Leagues North-West of <HI>Narbonne,</HI> and 12 of <HI>Carcassonne.</HI> Its Diocese comprehends the Towns or Burroughs of <HI>La Bastide,</HI> S. <HI>Amant de Valtoret, Angles, Olargues, La Voute, Cessenon, S.

<P>THis Precinct is not near so great as the an∣cient Territories of the <HI>Volcae Arecomici,</HI> who extended themselves through the Dioceses of <HI>Montpellier, Nismes, Ʋzès</HI> and <HI>Lodeve,</HI> en∣joyed the Town of <HI>Pezenas,</HI> and even some Lands beyond the <HI>Rhone.</HI> Now it is restrained within the Episcopal Jurisdiction of <HI>Montpellier</HI> and <HI>Nismes,</HI> and has the district of <HI>Beziers</HI> on the West, <HI>Gevaudan</HI> and <HI>Vivarais</HI> on the North and North-East, the <HI>Rhone</HI> on the East, and the Sea on the South. Its greatest length from <HI>Frontignan</HI> on the Pond of <HI>Maguelonne</HI> to the source of the <HI>Eraut,</HI> is 17 Leagues North and South, and its greatest breadth from <HI>Beaucaire</HI> on the <HI>Rhone</HI> to <HI>Anagne</HI> on the <HI>Eraut</HI> 22 Leagues East and West; but in some places it is so very tarrow, that it has hardly 4 or 5 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Montpellier,</HI> 3 Leagues South of the Sea, 13 East of <HI>Pesenas,</HI> and 14 North-East of <HI>Agde,</HI> is call'd in <HI>Latin Mons-pessulus, Mons-pessulanus, Mons-peslerius,</HI> and <HI>Mons-puellaris;</HI> but every one may see that these are not old <HI>Latin</HI> names; and likewise this Town is hardly known in Hi∣story, since 600 years, though it be now the biggest and richest in <HI>Languedoc</HI> after <HI>Toulouse.</HI> It is seated upon a Hill, whose foot is wash'd by
<PB N="546" REF="249"/> the small River <HI>Lez,</HI> which receives there ano∣ther Rivulet called <HI>Merdanson,</HI> after it has serv'd to the uses of the Town. The original of <HI>Mont∣pellier</HI> is related thus. There was formerly a strong and considerable City call'd <HI>Maguelonne, Magalo,</HI> in a Gulph, nam'd by <HI>Pliny, Laterna,</HI> and by the <HI>French, l'Etang du Tau, de Lates,</HI> or <HI>de Perraut.</HI> The foundation of <HI>Maguelonne</HI> is uncer∣tain, for tho the Coast of <HI>Lower Languedoc</HI> has been sometime in the power of the <HI>Marseillois,</HI> and <HI>Stephanus</HI> mentions <HI>Alonis</HI> as an Island belonging to them, whose Inhabitants were call'd <HI>Alonites,</HI> yet having no other testimony, a small and far fetched resemblance of names can scarce prove them to be one and the same. However it be, sure it is, that <HI>Maguelonne</HI> was an Episcopal City in the 5th and 6th Centuries, and a famous Sea∣port too, which was the cause of its ruin: For after the <HI>Saracens</HI> had conquered <HI>Spain,</HI> they spread themselves in <HI>Lower Languedoc,</HI> in 730, and threatned the whole Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> with a Barbarian Invasion, when they were ut∣terly routed by <HI>Charles Martel</HI> near <HI>Tours.</HI> As this great Captain had observ'd that they com∣monly landed at <HI>Maguelonne;</HI> when it had reta∣ken this Town in 736, he raz'd it to the very ground, and transferred the Episcopal See to <HI>Soustancion, Sextatio,</HI> almost a Mile East of <HI>Mont∣pellier. Soustancion</HI> is mention'd in the Geogra∣phical Tables of the Emperor <HI>Theodose,</HI> and in the Travels of <HI>Aethicus;</HI> but the Inhabi∣tants finding the Situation of the place, where now <HI>Montpellier</HI> lies more convenient, and the Air sweeter, began to build there. Thus the new Village increas'd by degrees, during 300
<PB N="547" REF="249"/> Years, that the B. of <HI>Maguelonne</HI> kept their Seat at <HI>Soustancion.</HI> But in 1060, <HI>Arnauld Julian,</HI> one of these Prelates, rais'd up the Walls of <HI>Mague∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nne,</HI> fortify'd them with Towers, and the Haven, where the <HI>Saracens</HI> us'd to land being stop'd, built another in a more convenient place. Before this the Governour of <HI>Maguelonne</HI> had retir'd to a place call'd now <HI>Mauguio,</HI> where he built a Castle under the name of <HI>Melgueil,</HI> and having usurp'd the Sovereignty of his Go∣vernment during the troubles of the <HI>French</HI> Mo∣narchy, he took upon him the Title of Count of <HI>Melgueil</HI> and <HI>Soustancion,</HI> and coyn'd a kind of small Money call'd the <HI>Melgoris</HI> pence. The Estates of these Counts pass'd in 1172 into the House of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>Ermes∣sende</HI> their Heiress with <HI>Raymond</HI> VI. Sirnamed <HI>the Old,</HI> and was confiscated upon his Son by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> III. and the Council of <HI>Latran,</HI> in 1215.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>Montpellier</HI> increas'd apace; for it appears by a passage of S. <HI>Bernard</HI> Abbot of <HI>Clairvaux,</HI> that there was already a School or Seminary of Physicians, in 1155; and in 1156, we find mention of its Baths, which were farm'd by the Lords of that Town, as be∣ing of a considerable Revenue. However the first Institution of its University is commonly ascrib'd to the Disciples of <HI>Averroes</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Avi∣cenne</HI> in 1196, and its perfect establishment is said to have been made but in 1220. About this time the Lords of <HI>Montpellier</HI> were in great esteem. This Lordship was first detached from the Patrimony of the Counts of <HI>Melgueil</HI> to be the Portion of <HI>Eustorgia,</HI> a Daughter of that
<PB N="548" REF="250"/> House: She had a Son call'd <HI>Fulcran,</HI> who be∣came Bishop of <HI>Lodeve,</HI> and two Daughters, who bequeathed their Estates to the Church of <HI>Ma∣guelonne</HI> in 975. These Prelates sold <HI>Montpellier</HI> to a Gentleman nam'd <HI>Gui,</HI> on condition that he should keep it as a Fee of the Church, and defend it against the <HI>Saracens.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Kings, and the succeeding Bishops of <HI>Mague∣lonne</HI> confirm'd this gift or sale, so that <HI>Mont∣pellier</HI> remain'd to his Posterity; who because of the increase of their Town, and the conside∣ration it came to be in, allied themselves with very illustrious Houses, as the Kings of <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> and of <HI>Aragon,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and the Counts of <HI>Foix,</HI> and became at last Kings of <HI>Majorca.</HI> But this small Kingdom was the ruine of their Patrimonial Estate; for <HI>James</HI> III. King of <HI>Majorca,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> having been depriv'd of his Realm by <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Arragon</HI> his Brother in Law, was compell'd by want and misery, to sell his Lordship to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valois</HI> in 1349.</P>
<P>Physick has the precedency in the Uni∣versity of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> yet both parts of the Law are taught in one of its Colleges, by four Royal Professors, with power of making Licen∣tiates and Doctors. There are besides a gene∣rality of the King's Treasurers, a Court of <HI>Ai∣des,</HI> a Chamber of Accounts, a Mint, and a Pre∣sidial-seat. <HI>Montpellier</HI> was one of the Towns of security, which <HI>Henry</HI> IV. had granted to the <HI>Prot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stants;</HI> but <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. designing the ruin of this part of his Subjects, forc'd them by Arms to surrender this pledge of his protection, and took this City after a long Siege and a vi∣gorous

However they were still fewer in num∣ber, and have been so till this last Persecution. <HI>Montpellier</HI> is govern'd by six Consuls or She∣riffs, who are also <HI>Viguiers</HI> or <HI>Baylies</HI> of the Town, and have a great attendance. The Mer∣chants have likewise their <HI>Consuls,</HI> under the came of <HI>Consuls of the Sea,</HI> to distinguish 'em from the Sheriffs, call'd <HI>Consuls Majours.</HI> There is a particular Court for Debts, whose Judge, sirnamed <HI>of the little Seal,</HI> has jurisdiction over them, who submit to him by contract. Besides the University, the Churches, and the Palace of the Justice; there are other Buildings wor∣thy to be taken notice of; as the Royal College for Humane Learning, the Cittadel, rais'd since the taking of <HI>Montpellier</HI> from the Protestants, and flank'd with four Bastions, two within and two without the Town: Near to its Wall is the Royal Garden of Simp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, extraordinary well kept and furnished.

<P><HI>NISMES, Nemausus Volcarum Arecomicorum,</HI> lies seven Leagues North-East of <HI>Arles,</HI> and ten and a half North-West of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> in a fertil Plain, overshadowed with Fruit-trees, and at the foot of Hills cover'd with Vineyards. It's a very ancient City, though the time of its foundation be uncertain. <HI>Stephanus</HI> and <HI>Sui∣das</HI> after him ascribe it to one <HI>Nemausus</HI> of <HI>Hercules</HI>'s posterity; whence <HI>Du Chesne</HI> infers, that it is a Greek Colony of the <HI>Marseillois;</HI> but as there have been many Hero's of that name, and that the Descendants of the Greek <HI>Hercules</HI> have been long in repute; this does not pre∣cisely determine the time of its first Building. <HI>De Valois</HI> derives it from a Fountain springing hereabouts, which <HI>Ausonius</HI> calls <HI>Nemausus;</HI> but it will still be doubtful, whether the City has given its name to the Fountain, or the Foun∣tain to the City, and whence both have got this appellation. It will be more useful and diver∣ting to consider the rise and various fortunes of <HI>Nismes,</HI> and withal the precious remains of its Antiquities. It owes its first increase to a Co∣lony of <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers, who return'd with <HI>August</HI> from the Conquest of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as appears by an ancient Inscription, which this City has taken for its Arms, COL.

<P>The most remarkable remains of Antiquity in <HI>Nismes</HI> are its Amphitheatre, the Square-house, or <HI>Maison quarrée,</HI> the great Tower or <HI>Tourre-magne,</HI> the Fountain <HI>Nemausus,</HI> and the Temple near this Fountain.</P>
<PB N="554" REF="253"/>
<P>The Amphitheatre call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Les Arenes</HI> is now but an Oval-Wall of 470 Steps, with 63 Arches, built up of very la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge Stones without Mortar or Plaister, which, how∣ever has not only withstood the ransackings of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Saracens;</HI> but even the Flames of <HI>Attila</HI> and <HI>Charles Martel,</HI> as appears by the black colour they are tainted with. Notwith∣standing one may still discern the Figures of <HI>Remus</HI> and <HI>Romulus</HI> suckling a She-wolf, the Vultures that appeared to these Founders of <HI>Rome,</HI> two Bull-heads upon the ancient Gate of this Building, and two Towers upon the new Gate. The Seats whence the Spectators saw the Shews have been remov'd from thence, and the Caves where the wild Beasts were kept are now fill'd up with Earth. Nay the whole capacity of the Amphitheatre is taken up with Houses, at least since the year 1179; as may be prov'd by Patentees granted by the Viscount <HI>Bernard Atten,</HI> where the Inhabitants of <HI>Nismes</HI> and those of the <HI>Arenes</HI> are distinguish'd; which shews, that this City has not been rebuilt where it formerly stood; for anciently the Amphi∣theatre was without the Town, and Warriors have oft made use of it, as of a Fort or Cit∣tadel.</P>
<P>The Square-house, <HI>La Maison quarrée,</HI> is a kind of <HI>Parellelogramme,</HI> or long Square, be∣ing 74 Foot in length, and 41 Foot 6 Inches in breadth. Its front is adorned with 6 Co∣lumns, and each side with ten. The top is flat and cover'd with square Free-stones extra∣ordinary large, so that one may walk upon it without any danger. As we do not know who

For its form which has no likeness at all with the antient Basilicks, does not allow us to take it for that magnificent Building rais'd up by <HI>Adrian;</HI> neither is the vulgar name of <HI>Cap-dueil</HI> sufficient to make a Capitole of it, since no antient Author speaks of a Capitole of <HI>Nismes.</HI> But as its front has a great resemblance with those of the antient Temples; one may believe with the Learned <HI>Spon</HI> in his curious inquiries of Antiquity, that it was a Temple dedicated to <HI>Jupiter Capi∣toline.</HI></P>
<P>Without the Walls of the City upon the top of a high Hill, rises an antient Building, call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Tourre-Magne,</HI> the great Tower, because of its prodigious height, or that it exceeded by far all the Towers round about. For by the remains it seems to have been a Watch or Tower, built in the form of a Pyra∣mide at one of the Corners of its antient Walls. One may still distinguish the Stairs, whereupon they ascended to the top, and the Niches or Case-frames, wherein they plac'd the Statues of their Gods. The whole Fabrick is of small square Stones, so well cemented together, that the most industrious Mason should not throw down two Foot of it in a day.</P>
<P>At the Foot of that Hill springs a most clear and pleasant Fountain, in the form of a Pond, with a Whirl-pool in the middle, wherein, if any Creature chance to fall, it is never to be seen again. This spring is the Source of the <HI>Vistre,</HI> so call'd from the brittle and transparent
<PB N="556" REF="254"/> colour of its Water, an <HI>Epithete</HI> given it by <HI>Au∣sonius, Vitrea non luce Nemausus.</HI> A branch of this Fountain runs through a Channel pur∣posely drawn into the City. As to the course of the <HI>Vistre,</HI> you may see it in the Rivers of <HI>Languedoc.</HI></P>
<P>Near this Fountain is an old Square-Temple, under-propt by two rows of Columns with their Bars, Chapters, Architraves, Frizes, Cor∣nishes and Mouldings, all in a just proportion, together with Niches or Case-frames, and round Windows in the Walls, for the Statues of their Gods, and Eagles of emboss'd Work, whose Heads have been broken off by the barbarous <HI>Goths, Huns,</HI> or <HI>Saracens</HI> in contempt of the <HI>Romans.</HI> This Temple has been turned into a Monastery of Nuns; and because of the Eagles and other marks of its former magnificence, I should be apt to take it for the <HI>Basilick</HI> of <HI>A∣drien,</HI> rather than the Square-house, or any o∣ther antient Building.</P>
<P>To avoid length, I shall not mention the many Statues and Inscriptions that are found in this City, nor insist upon the Monuments of newer date, as the Wine-Tower, <HI>La Tour Vina∣tiere,</HI> so call'd Because built out of an excise up∣on Wine. <HI>Mont-pouzieu,</HI> in the inclosure of the Monastery of S. <HI>Bauzille</HI> is a Hill of Clay, that formerly was the burying-place of the <HI>Jews,</HI> for which, they us'd to pay a certain quantity of Pepper to the Monks. The King's Castle, the Column erected at the entry of <HI>Francis</HI> I. with a Salamandre upon it, the Clock-Tower, the Crown-gate with its Bulwark, and the Pa∣lace
<PB N="557" REF="254"/> of the Presidial are considerable Build∣ings.</P>
<P><HI>Sulpice Severe,</HI> mentions a Council held at <HI>Nismes</HI> in 389, but does not name the Bishop of it. The first of whose subscription we read is <HI>Gilbert</HI> of <HI>Nismes,</HI> who assisted at a Synod, call'd in his Diocese by his Metropolitan in 886, and the old Notices of the <HI>Gauls</HI> name <HI>Nismes;</HI> but in the 4th. or 5th. place among the 8 Suf∣fragans of <HI>Narbonne;</HI> so that the erection of this Bishoprick seems not to have preceded the 4th. or 5th. Age.</P>
<P>Four Leagues North-East of <HI>Nismes,</HI> lies the Village of St. <HI>Privat,</HI> renown'd for a most plea∣sant House belonging to a Gentleman, who bears the name of it, and adorn'd with delicious Gar∣dens, Fountains, Grotto's, Water-spouts, Alleys, Green-closets, and the like. Over against it are the remains of the famous <HI>Pont du Gard,</HI> one of the Master-pieces of the <HI>Romans.</HI> It was inten∣ded to conduct the Waters of the Mountains of <HI>Remoulins</HI> to those of <HI>Ledenon,</HI> and thence into <HI>Nismes,</HI> for the uses of that City, but especial∣ly to represent Sea-fights in its Amphitheatre. It may be too, that the course of the River <HI>Gard</HI> or <HI>Gardon,</HI> which now runs under these Bridges was turn'd off thorough a Channel, that is yet partly in being, has six Foot in heigth, three in breadth, and is covered with large Stones. But more of it in the Diocese of <HI>Ʋzès.</HI></P>
<P>Four Leagues South of <HI>Pont du Gard,</HI> and as many East of <HI>Nismes,</HI> lies the Town of <HI>Beau∣caire, Belliquadrum</HI> or <HI>Bellum quadrum,</HI> that is
<PB N="558" REF="255"/> fine Square, undoubtedly so call'd from its Square form and pleasant Situation; for its seated upon the <HI>Rhone,</HI> next to the small Island <HI>Valabregue,</HI> and over against <HI>Tarascon</HI> in <HI>Pro∣vence,</HI> from which it's only separated by the River. It is the Seat of a Seneschal, but is much more renown'd for its Fair on the 22. of <HI>July,</HI> or S. <HI>Magdalen</HI>'s day, whether come Merchants from most parts of the World, even from <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI> This Town belonged formerly to the Counts of <HI>Provence;</HI> but <HI>Rai∣mond Berenger</HI> I. yielded it to <HI>Alphonse Jour∣dain</HI> Count of <HI>Toulouse, September</HI> 16. 1125. The Papists took it during the Wars of the <HI>Albigeois,</HI> but the Inhabitants revolted from them to <HI>Raimond</HI> the Young their lawful Ma∣ster. In 1251, <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>France</HI> Count of <HI>Pro∣vence,</HI> holding a conference at <HI>Beaucaire</HI> with his Brother <HI>Alphonse,</HI> Count of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> the Ci∣tizens of <HI>Avignon</HI> forc'd them to take the Oath of Allegiance to their Government. After <HI>Al∣phonse</HI>'s death <HI>Beaucaire</HI> return'd to the <HI>French</HI> Crown with the other Estates of those Counts. In 1561 the Protestants took this Town, and put Garrison in it under one <HI>Hardwin</HI> of <HI>Por∣celles,</HI> and the Roman Catholicks having reta∣ken it, they were expell'd the same day with the loss of 1200 Men. <HI>Beaucaire</HI> had then a Castle upon the Rock, on the Rivers side, which has been since demolish'd in 1632, on occasion of new Civil Wars.</P>
<P>Three Miles South-West of <HI>Beaucaire,</HI> lies betwixt Mountains the Town of <HI>Belle-garde,</HI> and 3 Miles South-East of <HI>Belle-garde</HI> the Village of <HI>Fourques Furcae,</HI> so called because the <HI>Rhone</HI> di∣vides
<PB N="559" REF="255"/> here it self into three branches, much like to a Fork: 4 Leagues South-West of <HI>Beaucaire,</HI> and above two West of <HI>Fourques,</HI> lies upon a Rivulet the small Town of S. <HI>Gilles Sti. Aegidii Fanum.</HI> It has its name from an <HI>Anachoret,</HI> who retir'd thither in the 6th. Century, and a famous Abby that was built there under his name, which has been since given to secular Priests. It's said that the <HI>Gottish</HI> Kings had there a Palace, and that this Town is to be understood by the name of <HI>Palatium Gothorum,</HI> which is found in the Authors of those times. At least it is sure that the Counts of <HI>Toulouse</HI> took the Title of Counts of S. <HI>Gilles,</HI> and that sometimes the whole Pro∣vince was understood by that name. This Town belongs now to the Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> under the Title of great Priory, and it was near it that the Protestants got a signal Victory over the Roman Catholicks, headed by the Count of <HI>Somme-rive</HI> in 1562. In a Neighbouring Forrest call'd <HI>E∣stagel,</HI> is a Chair of Stone, which is thought to have serv'd the <HI>Druides,</HI> who us'd to render ju∣stice or to pronounce their Oracles in the Woods.</P>

The Pond <HI>Laterna</HI> and the <HI>Rhone</HI> have communication to∣gether
<PB N="560" REF="256"/> by a Channel, upon which this Town is seated, and which because of the little motion of its Water has given it the name of <HI>Aigues-mortes, Aquae-mortuae.</HI> Before one enters into it, it meets with a Tower call'd <HI>la Tour Carbon∣niere,</HI> that was taken by the Protestants in 1562. The Town is of a square figure, surrounded with good Walls, and 16 strong Towers, among which that of <HI>Constance</HI> is the most considerable, as having a Phare or Beacon to direct the course of the Ships.</P>
<P>Three Miles Westwards upon the Western Mouth of the <HI>Rhone,</HI> lies the Fort of <HI>Pecais,</HI> built to defend the Salt-pits, which are here so abundant, that they suffice to furnish with it, not only <HI>Languedoc</HI> and the Neighbouring Pro∣vinces, but even Foreign Countries, if we believe <HI>Du Verdier,</HI> so that all the other Salt-pits, ex∣cepting those of <HI>Peyriac</HI> and <HI>Sigean;</HI> in the Dio∣cese of <HI>Narbonne</HI> have been spoiled and drown∣ed, not to make Salt too common. <HI>Marsiliar∣gues</HI> is a little fine Town, 5 Miles South of <HI>Ai∣gues-mortes,</HI> and 2 North-West of <HI>Lunel,</HI> that has the Title of a <HI>Viguery.</HI> Higher up you meet with <HI>Gaillargues, Aubais, Aigues-vives, Cau∣visson, Sommieres</HI> upon the <HI>Vidourle Sumerium</HI> a Viguery, <HI>Ville-vieille, Clarensac, Cour-Couronne Quessas, Sauve Salvia,</HI> a Viguery, <HI>Pompignan, Ledignan, Cassagnolle.

<PB N="561" REF="256"/> St. <HI>Hippolite</HI> lies betwixt Mountains near the source of the <HI>Vidourle,</HI> 5 Miles East of <HI>Anduse,</HI> and though it be none of the biggest, yet its Inhabitants had of late years the courage to Preach upon the ruins of their Temple, think∣ing that their example would be follow'd by their Neighbours; but they found themselves mistaken, and expos'd almost alone to the <HI>French</HI> King's rage, who caus'd the most part to be murthered or sent to the Gallies.</P>
<P><HI>Alais Alestum,</HI> upon the Northern Branch of the <HI>Gardon,</HI> three Leagues North-East of <HI>Anduse</HI> follow'd the same fate, submitting to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. after the taking of <HI>Privas</HI> in 1629.

<P>THis Country the most North-Eastern and Mountainous part of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> has the Dioceses of <HI>Nismes</HI> and <HI>Lodeve</HI> on the South, <HI>Rouergue</HI> on the West, <HI>Auvergne</HI> and <HI>Forez</HI> on the North, and the <HI>Rhone</HI> of the East. These Mountains reach a great way through <HI>Auvergne</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> but their extent is commonly reckon'd from <HI>Lodeve</HI> to <HI>Montpezat,</HI> near the source of the <HI>Loire</HI> about 30 Leagues, and the name of <HI>CEVENNES</HI> more properly given to the Country about <HI>Anduse, Alais,</HI> St. <HI>Ambroise,</HI> and St. <HI>Hippolite.</HI> The Greek Authors call these Mountains <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the Latin <HI>Cemmeni Mon∣tes</HI> or <HI>Cebenna. Caesar</HI> says, that the <HI>Auvergnats</HI> were separated from the <HI>Helvians</HI> or Inhabitants of <HI>Vivarais</HI> by the <HI>CEVENNES;</HI> but other La∣tin Authors, as <HI>Pliny, Mela</HI> and <HI>Ausonius</HI> give that name to all that long ridg of Mountains, from the <HI>Rhone</HI> to the <HI>Pyrenées,</HI> and the <HI>Garonne,</HI> which formerly divided the <HI>Celtes</HI> from the <HI>Nar∣bonnoise Gaul.</HI> Nay some <HI>Geographers,</HI> as <HI>Oli∣varius,</HI> pretend that the Ancients comprehen∣ded, even the Mountains of <HI>Auvergne,</HI> under the general name of CEVENNES. Whatever be of that, here are several Lead and Tin Mines, and of Gold and Silver too, as <HI>De Valois</HI> be∣lieves,
<PB N="563" REF="257"/> which are not digg'd out and improved for want of Slaves. The Protestants were ve∣ry strong in this Country, and the convenien∣cy of the Mountains enabled them to resist <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. but no Foreign Power taking their part, and even their Brethren of other Provin∣ces leaving them in the lurch they were soon forced to yield. In 1683, the Protestants be∣yond the <HI>Loire,</HI> or of the Southern parts of <HI>France,</HI> drew up a project, which had it been made sooner, or even then constantly and vigorously follow'd, would most probably have stopp'd the Persecution. (For <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. how cruel soever he is, would have been loth to exterminate two Millions of Men.) Name∣ly they agreed amongst them, as many as could come together from several parts in those troublesome times, not to comply willingly any longer, with the Edicts and Declarations given against 'em, in order to pull down their Chur∣ches, to forbid their Assemblies, to put their Pastors into Prison, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to obey God rather than Men, and generously to encounter Death and Martyrdom, still keeping themselves in a passive and defensive way. But the Inhabitants of the Wealthiest Cities; especially of such where the number of Roman Catholicks prevail'd, could not assent to, nor put this project into Execution. They being thus divided, having no Head to command 'em, nor any settled union and correspondence amongst themselves; this Brave and Christian resolution came to nothing, being only perform'd in some parts of the CE∣VENNES, and of the Valleys of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> where it serv'd for a pretence to the Ministers of the
<PB N="564" REF="258"/> Popish barbarities, to represent 'em in Foreign Parts, as a set of seditious Men. However they never attacked any body; but because the King's Dragons pursued them into Forests and Desarts, whether soever they might retire themselves, the Men went arm'd with the Women and Children to keep them harmless. But the King's Officers took their time so well, that they seiz'd on the most couragious, and got 'em broken upon the Wheel. Those that remained united had the better fate, for many obtain'd passes to go out of the Kingdom. I have seen a young Man in <HI>Holland,</HI> who was one of the Heads of the <HI>Vivarois,</HI> that forc'd the Intendant or the King's Overseer in the Province, to grant him a Pass, and to 500 of his Camerades, and safely to conduct 'em on the Territories of <HI>Spain;</HI> whence, after they had suffered much by the blind and barbarous zeal of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the cruelty of the Inquisitors, some at last made their escape into Protestant Countries.</P>
<P>The Precincts of CEVENNES comprehends three small Countries, each of which keeps its separate States after the Assembly of the Gene∣ral States of <HI>Languedoc, viz. Vivarais</HI> on the East, <HI>Gevaudan</HI> on the West, and <HI>Velay</HI> on the North.</P>

<P>IT's known that 60 or 70 years before the intire Conquest of the <HI>Gauls</HI> by <HI>Julius Cae∣sar,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> having vanquish'd the <HI>Sa∣lians,</HI> and the <HI>Allobroges</HI> in 631 and 632 of <HI>Rome,</HI> reduc'd into a Province the South-Eastern part of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> included betwixt the <HI>Cevennes, Mount-Jura, the Alps</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, and call'd <HI>Gallia Braccata,</HI> or the <HI>Gauls wear∣ing Breaches.</HI> They pleased themselves more in this Country, than in any other of their Con∣quests, for which reason they us'd to name it <HI>Our Province,</HI> or absolutely the <HI>Province.</HI> In process of time several Changes, Divisions and Subdivisions having been made, that part near∣est to the Sea, and <HI>Italy</HI> carried alone the name of <HI>Provincia,</HI> or <HI>Provence</HI> in the Country Lan∣guage; probably because of the strict relation it kept with <HI>Italy,</HI> in the midst of all those Re∣volutions.</P>
<PB N="579" REF="265"/>
<P><HI>Gallia Narbonensis</HI> was subdivided into five Provinces, the first and second <HI>Narbonnoise,</HI> the <HI>Viennoise,</HI> the <HI>Greek,</HI> the <HI>Apennin,</HI> and the <HI>Ma∣ritim Alps.

<P>In the decay of the Roman Empire, the <HI>Wisi∣goths</HI> and <HI>Burgundians</HI> conquer'd this Province. <HI>Theodoric</HI> an <HI>Ostrogoth</HI> King having master'd <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> seiz'd upon PROVENCE under pretence of Guardianship to <HI>Atalaric</HI> King of the <HI>Wisigoths</HI> his great Grandson.

In the di∣vision the Sons of the Emperor <HI>Lewis the Meek</HI> made of his Dominions, PROVENCE together with <HI>Italy</HI> fell to the share of <HI>Lotharius</HI> the el∣dest of 'em. And though during the weakness of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, Counts usurp'd the So∣vereign Power in PROVENCE, as did one <HI>Ro∣baud</HI> or <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld</HI> about the year 900, which was continued almost six Centuries through several Families; yet these Counts were sometimes Kings in <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>Boson,</HI> his Son <HI>Hugh,</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Anjou,</HI> who were Counts of PRO∣VENCE, and Kings of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> from <HI>Charles</HI> II. call'd <HI>the Lamb</HI> in 1285 to <HI>Charles</HI> IV.

<P>The Rivers of PROVENCE, besides the <HI>Buech</HI> and the <HI>Durance,</HI> that are describ'd in <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> are the Rivulets of <HI>Sosse, Jabron, Bleone, Targue, Laro</HI> and <HI>Asse,</HI> falling into the <HI>Durance</HI> from <HI>Sisteron</HI> to <HI>Manosque.</HI> The <HI>Verdon</HI> rises in the Mountains of the Diocese of <HI>Digne,</HI> washes <HI>Col∣mars, Castellane, Montpezat,</HI> receives the <HI>Issolet,</HI> the <HI>Nartabre,</HI> and the <HI>Auvestre,</HI> and mixes with the Durance at S. <HI>Paol.</HI> The Rocks and steep downfalls of the <HI>Durance</HI> hinder it from being navigable, till about this place; however it's yet increas'd with the <HI>Tese,</HI> the <HI>Durancole,</HI> the <HI>Calevon,</HI> that goes through <HI>Apt,</HI> and some other Rivulets before it discharges it self into the <HI>Rhone,</HI> betwixt <HI>Avignon</HI> and <HI>Barbentane.</HI> The <HI>Louveze</HI> springs in the <HI>Baronies,</HI> at a place call'd <HI>Montauban,</HI> goes through <HI>le Buys, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olans, Val∣zon,</HI> receives the <HI>Russe</HI> that waters <HI>Carpentras,</HI>

<P>PROVENCE view'd in a Map affords but an unpleasant prospect, for it seems as though the greatest part of it were cover'd with barren Mountains. However it is not so, for except in some few places of the Bayliwick of <HI>Seyne,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Embrunois,</HI> all the other Moun∣tains are fruitful Hills or Hillocks, which not only produce the best Corn, and the most deli∣cious Wine in <HI>France,</HI> but sometimes one and the same Mountain will yield such Fruits as re∣quire a different Climate; being cover'd on the South side with Vines, Plume, and Olive-trees, Pomegranates, Oranges, Citrons, Limons, and on the North side with Cherries, Apples, Pears, Almonds, and Walnuts. Neither does the Coun∣try
<PB N="582" REF="267"/> want Pastures and Woods, especially in the Northern parts, though the latter be not in great quantity, because of the industry of the Inhabitants. The Air is as temperate as the Soyl is fruitful, for the Sky is clear most part of the year, and rain falls very seldom. The Sou∣thern parts along the Sea-coast would be very hot, were it not for the <HI>Bize</HI> or North Wind, that refreshes and purifies the Air, but creates a severe cold when it blows in Winter. Those that keep there Sheep and Herds of Cattel send them in Summer to <HI>Devolui</HI> and other Moun∣tains of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> having Pastures of their own, the greatest part of the Winter. They make vast quantity of Silk, by feeding Silk-worms with leaves of Mulberry-trees, as also Salt upon the Sea-coasts. Thence are transported into Foreign Countries the <HI>Salicor</HI> a kind of Ashes fit to make Glasses and Soap of; together with Saffron, Vermilion, Cork, and Rosin, an oily juice running out of the Male Pine-trees. The few heaths and wastes that are there; are cover∣ed with Thyme, Hysop, Lavander, Rosemary, Sage, Juniper, and Myrtle-trees.</P>

<PB N="583" REF="267"/> with all the others of <HI>France.</HI> In those days they already complain'd of their exorbi∣tant Taxes, with a very expressive Proverb, <HI>Lou Languedoc is ruinad, La Prouvence es accou∣mencade. The ruin of</HI> Languedoc <HI>is finished, and that of</HI> PROVENCE <HI>is begun;</HI> but now I be∣lieve they have but little reproach one another.</P>
<P>PROVENCE is divided into Upper and Lower: The Upper lies on the North side of the River <HI>Durance, Verdon,</HI> and <HI>Esteron,</HI> nearer to <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> and the Lower on the South side, along the Sea-coast; but lest I should forget some part of it, I shall treat of each Diocese af∣ter one another, and begin with <HI>Aix</HI> the Ca∣pital.</P>

<P>THis Diocese is included betwixt those of <HI>Marseille, Arles, Apt, Riez, Frejuls and Toulon,</HI> and is the biggest of all, reach∣ing 26 Leagues East and West from beyond <HI>Cotignac</HI> near the Diocese of <HI>Frejus</HI> to the Plains of <HI>la Crau,</HI> and about 10 North and South. This Country was anciently inhabited by the <HI>Salians, Salyes, Salyi,</HI> or <HI>Saluvii,</HI> and 'tis in this Territory that <HI>C.

<P>The City of AIX, <HI>Aquae Sextiae,</HI> or <HI>Aquensis Civitas,</HI> is within a Musket-shot of the little River <HI>Arc,</HI> 5 Leagues of <HI>Provence</HI> North a <HI>Mar∣seilles.</HI> It is very Ancient. <HI>Caius Sextus</HI> a Pro∣consul carried thither a Roman Colony, in 632, of <HI>Rome,</HI> and made the warm Bathes from which it draws its name, though the Bathes be not longer in being.

The Chapter consists of a Provost, an Archdeacon, a <HI>Capiscol,</HI> a Sex∣ton, a Penitentiary, and 15 Canons; there are also some Incumbents or Prebendaries, and a most delicate Musick, two other Parishes, <HI>viz.</HI> S. <HI>Magdalen,</HI> and the Holy Ghost, divers Mona∣steries, and a College of Jesuits.</P>
<P>S. <HI>Maximin</HI> above 9 Leagues East of AIX, is the Seat of a Baily, but much more famous for a pretended S. <HI>Ampulla,</HI> and the Body of S. <HI>Ma∣ry Magdalen</HI> said to be kept here in a Collegiate Church, serv'd by <HI>Dominican</HI> Fryers. Many a∣mongst us would rather chuse the Case than the Relick, for the Case is all of pure Gold, being the figure of a Woman, held up by two Angels, and Crown'd with a golden Crown enriched with Diamonds; whereas the Relick may be, for ought I know, the Skeleton of some old Bawd.</P>
<P>Nine Miles South West of S. <HI>Maximin,</HI> lies in the midst of a thick wood the Cavern of <HI>la S. Baume,</HI> where the Legendaries say, that S. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> passed 33 years in a retir'd and penitent life; after she was arriv'd thither from

<P>THis Diocese that lies on the Sea-coast is ve∣ry narrow, having the Gulf and Island of <HI>Martegue</HI> on the West, the Archbishoprick of <HI>Aix</HI> on the North, the Bishoprick of <HI>Toulo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> on the East, and the Sea on the South.</P>
<P>The City of MARSEILLE, <HI>Massilia,</HI> or <HI>Mas∣salia,</HI> is upon the Mediterranean Sea, with a Bishoprick Suffragan of <HI>Arles,</HI> an Admirality a Seneschal's Court, a Bayliwick, and other Jurisdictions; its Port is sheltered from Winds, and so good, that it has never been heard a Ship has perished in it. And therefore it's the usual abode of the Gallies, and where most Merchant-men of the <HI>Levant</HI> do resort; which render it very Populous and Trading. The <HI>Phoceans</HI> or <HI>Phocenses,</HI> who came from <HI>Phocea,</HI> a Colony of <HI>Athens</HI> in that part of <HI>Asia</HI> called <HI>Ionia,</HI> were its Founders.

<PB N="595" REF="273"/> and had a famous University. The <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> had a great esteem for it, and made an Alliance with it. It has undergone many revo∣lutions, and sustained many Wars; it has had its Viscounts, and divers other Sovereign Lords, and was at last united to the Crown at the same time, as the rest of <HI>Provence, viz.</HI> in 1481. This City has been the Mother of many great Men, and is now one of the biggest, finest, and best built of the Kingdom; since it has been inlar∣ged by the <HI>French</HI> King's order. The Port, the Arcenal, the Cittadel, the Gallies; many other Buildings, the South Walk or Race, the New Streets, the Markets, the neat and stately Hou∣ses, Churches, Monasteries, Seminaries, Hospi∣tals, the College of the Fathers of the Oratory, the Fountains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are worth the curiosity of Strangers.</P>

Savornin Gordes, Reilhane, Beaumont, Mirabeau, Tour d'Ay∣gues</HI> a strong hold with one of the finest Hou∣ses in the Province; <HI>Lourmarin, Merindol, Me∣nerbe, Aupede</HI> and <HI>Cabrieres,</HI> were good Bur∣roughs, whilst inhabited by the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> but since their barbarous Murther, they are but in∣considerable places.</P>
<P>I shall give here a more faithful account of it than that partial Scribler <HI>Morery,</HI> who says enough, however to make appear the unheard Cruelties of the Roman Church.</P>
<P>It must b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> observed before all, that time out of mind the Lords of <HI>France</HI> were not properly Sub∣jects, but only Vassals to the King, and Sovereigns under him; and that their Fees, Castles &amp; Mannors could not be ransack'd or pull'd down, nor their Subjects abused or kill'd, unless it were for Crime of High Treason. Now the places of <HI>Merindol, Cabrireres, La Coste, &amp;c.</HI> whether the <HI>Vaudois</HI> resorted, belong'd to a Lord, who prote∣cted them, and all the Crimes they were found guilty of was to profess the same Religion, that was persecuted in other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> and to give retreat to such as escaped the bloody Hands of their Murderers. The <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Francis</HI> the I. prevailed upon by the Monks, gave out a severe Edict against all the Protestants, in 1535, and the Parliament of <HI>Aix</HI> condemned
<PB N="604" REF="278"/> to be burned 19 Inhabitants of <HI>Merindol,</HI> and the neighbouring places, most of whom were Mi∣nisters; but the first President <HI>Chassanée,</HI> a learned Lawyer superseded the Execution of it. He was suceeded by a most cruel Man, <HI>John Meynier,</HI> Baron of <HI>Oppede,</HI> or <HI>Auppede</HI> who making use of the ab∣sence of the King's Lieutenant, the Count of <HI>Grig∣nan,</HI> put himself at the head of the Troops, that were in that Province, accompanied by a Capt. called the Baron of <HI>La Garde,</HI> the second Pre∣sident, two Counsellors, and <HI>William Guerin,</HI> Advocate General of that Parliament. Thus they went on to <HI>Merindol,</HI> and were reinforced in their way by the Troops of the Pope's Legate from <HI>Avignon.</HI> The poor <HI>Vaudois</HI> retired into Woods and Mountains; so that the Persecutor's Army found nothing in their Villages and Bur∣oughs; but old and sick Men, Women and Chil∣dren, however they had the Barbarity of Mur∣dering every one of them, and burning and razing all their Habitations, nay even of hang∣ing 30 of them, who had surrendred themselves upon Terms. <HI>Maimburg</HI> confesses, that there were 3000 murdered, 600 sent to the Gallies, 24 Villages, and 900 Houses burnt; but others make it amount to a far greater number. This hapned in 1546, when <HI>Francis</HI> the first had Notice of it, he was sensible of the injustice they had done; saying, that they had made use of his Name, to destroy the most honest Men in his Kingdom, and therefore ordered at his Death, which happened some Months after, to his Son and Successor, <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, that he should not leave those Barbarities unpunished. Ac∣cordingly this Prince immediately after his
<PB N="605" REF="278"/> coming to the Crown, named Commissaries to judge of this Affair; but the Mony, and power of the Clergy, stopped their Mouths; so that the King was forced to remove the Suit before the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> by his Patents of 1551. Then the Persecutors not being able to avoid Justice any longer, threw the hatred of all this horrid and unlawful Executions, upon some Soldiers who were dead, or whom they had caused to make their escape, and upon the Ad∣vocate General <HI>Guerin,</HI> who was beheaded in the place of <HI>Greve.</HI> As to the Baron of <HI>Oppede,</HI> tho his Credit sav'd him from the hands of Hu∣mane Justice; yet it could not deliver him from the hands of God, who called him before his Tribunal in 1558, by the most painful Death that ever was, as you may see in <HI>Thuanus, Du∣pleix,</HI> and other Roman Catholick Historians.</P>

<HEAD>Of the County <HI>Venaissin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE County <HI>Venaissin,</HI> that is now a dependen∣cy of the Papal See, borders on <HI>Provence</HI> to the East; on <HI>Dauphiné</HI> to the North; on the <HI>Durance</HI> to the South; and on <HI>Languedoc</HI> to the West. It is about 13 or 14 Leagues from South to North, and from West to East; it is the first of the Pope's Legateships, a fruitful and pleasant Country; there are an Archbishoprick, 3 Bishopricks, 4 Baronies, and 78 Towns, Bur∣roughs or Villages.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Romans</HI> time, it was inhabited by the <HI>Cavares</HI> and <HI>Memini,</HI> since it pass'd under the <HI>French,</HI> and from them to the Marquesses and
<PB N="606" REF="279"/> the Counts of <HI>Provence.</HI> In 1228 the Estates of <HI>Raimond</HI> Count of <HI>Toulouse,</HI> having been seiz'd from him, because of his protecting the <HI>Albi∣geois,</HI> it was agreed amongst the Usurpers, that the Lands which <HI>Raimond</HI> had possest on the East of the <HI>Rhone</HI> should be settled in trust, only for a time, to <HI>Gregory</HI> IX. as appears by the Letters of this Pope to the <HI>French</HI> K. <HI>Lewis</HI> IX. and Queen <HI>Blanche</HI> his Mother, in 1230, and 1233. Its modern name <HI>Venaissin</HI> comes from <HI>Venatione,</HI> because of the vast quantity of Game that is in this Country.</P>
<P><HI>Avignon</HI> and its Territory made up a separate Dominion; which still belong'd to the Counts of <HI>Provence;</HI> but in 1348 <HI>Jane</HI> Queen of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily▪</HI> Countess of <HI>Provence,</HI> sold this City with its Suburbs and Territory, for the Summ of 80000 Golden Florens, that is 48000 <HI>French</HI> Livres, to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VI. and lest it should be said that this summ came not near the value of so considerable a City, it was inserted in the Agreement, that the Queen made a free gift of the over-plus to the Pope. Hereupon the <HI>French</HI> Historians observe, 1. That this Princess being born in 1328. was not yet out of Age, no more than her second Husband <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Taran∣te.</HI> 2dly. That the sale was made without the consent of the Guardians given her by K. <HI>Ro∣bert</HI> her Grandfather, when he instituted her his Universal Heir against his express will. 3. That some years after the same Pope to hinder Queen <HI>Jane</HI> of selling others of her Countries, gave out a <HI>Bull</HI> declaring void all the aliena∣tions made, or to be made by the said Queen, both in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> and in the
<PB N="607" REF="279"/> County of <HI>Provence,</HI> against the will of the said K. <HI>Robert</HI> her Grandfather. 4thly. That in 1365 Queen <HI>Jane</HI> declar'd void the sale of <HI>Avig∣non,</HI> and all the others she had made to that very time.</P>
<P>These are the Chief reasons on which the <HI>French</HI> Kings ground their pretensions over <HI>A∣vignon</HI> and County <HI>Venaissin,</HI> and for which they never fail of seizing upon this City and County, as soon as they are at variance with the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> as did <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in 1663. and 1688. I leave the Reader to judge of them, as he may do very impartially, since they are both our Enemies; only with this difference, that the one, <HI>viz.</HI> the Pope is irreconcilable to us as long as we are Protestants, whereas within some years we may be at peace with the other.</P>
<P>The City of AVIGNON, <HI>Avenio, Cavarum,</HI> is upon the <HI>Rhone,</HI> 8 Leagues North of <HI>Arles,</HI> almost as many South East of <HI>Ʋzès,</HI> and 10 North East of <HI>Nismes,</HI> with an University and an Archbishoprick, only since the year 1475. under <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. It was before that time a Bi∣shoprick Suffragan of <HI>Arles.</HI> Pope <HI>Clement</HI> IV. removed the Pontifical See to <HI>Avignon</HI> in 1305. <HI>Clement</HI> VI. bought that City 37 years after, his Successors lived there quietly till the year 1380. as also during the Schism, that is to the Council of <HI>Pise,</HI> in 1409. It has a Court of In∣quisition; a Mint where Money is coyned with the Pope's Arms; its Walls are fine, its Churches magnificent, its Avenues pleasant. The justice is administred by the Consuls and their As∣sessor, who is the Judge of the City; the Vi∣guier, who is like the Provost of Merchants in
<PB N="608" REF="280"/> <HI>Paris,</HI> or the Lord Mayor in <HI>London,</HI> judges without farther appeal, all Causes and Suits not exceeding four gold Duckets; but in other Causes one may appeal to the Vice-Legate, who commits the matter to the Rote, which consists of five Auditors, and from thence one may still appeal to <HI>Rome.</HI> All the Canons of the Cathe∣dral Church of our Blessed Lady, are clothed in Red, and the Chaplains in Purple; seven Popes have seated there during 70 years, from 1307. till 1377. <HI>viz. Clement</HI> V. <HI>John</HI> XXII. <HI>Bene∣dict</HI> XII. <HI>Clement</HI> VI. <HI>Innocent</HI> VI. <HI>Ʋrban</HI> V. and <HI>Gregory</HI> XI. who by the persuasion of St. <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Sienne</HI> remov'd to <HI>Rome</HI> again; to∣gether with three Antipopes, <HI>Clement</HI> VII. <HI>Bo∣niface</HI> IX. and <HI>Benedict</HI> XIII. from 1378 till 1409. This is called by the <HI>Italians, The Baby∣lonian Captivity of the Church.</HI> And well may they compare their Church to <HI>Babylon;</HI> for 'tis as like to the Mystical <HI>Babylon</HI> of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> as two drops of Water are to each other. A∣mongst other resemblances the following will not be unpleasant, <HI>viz.</HI> that the number of Seven, the number of the Heads of the <HI>Beast,</HI> seems to be affected in the publick buildings of <HI>Avignon,</HI> which is the Master-piece of the Popes, for there are 7 Parishes, 7 Monasteries, 7 Hospi∣tals, 7 Colleges, 7 Palaces, 7 Markets, and 7 Gates, which make up 7 times 7.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Carpentras, Carpentoracte Memi∣norum,</HI> lies upon the <HI>Russe</HI> 5 or 6 Leagues from <HI>Antignon,</HI> with a Judge in Ordinary, an Office of the Pope's Exchequer, and a Bishoprick Sus∣fragan of <HI>Avignon.</HI> It is seated on the foot of Mount <HI>Ventoux,</HI> which is four Leagues high, and
<PB N="609" REF="280"/> on the ruins of <HI>Venasque</HI> or <HI>Vindausca,</HI> in a fruit∣ful Soil, with good Walls about it. This is pro∣perly the Chief City of the County <HI>Venaissin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cavaillon, Cabellio Colonia,</HI> lies upon the <HI>Du∣rance,</HI> in an Island form'd by that River, the <HI>Calevon</HI> and the <HI>Durancole,</HI> 9 Miles South West of <HI>Avignon.</HI> It was formerly seated on a Hill, where are still some remains of old Buildings, but now it lies in a very fruitful Plain, though for the rest it is small and ill built; the Cathe∣dral is dedicated under the name of S. <HI>Veran,</HI> one of its Bishops in the 6th. Century. It be∣long'd to the <HI>Cavares.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vaison, Vasio,</HI> is seated upon a Hill washed by the <HI>Louveze.</HI> It's mention'd by <HI>Pliny, Ptolomy,</HI> and other ancient Geographers, as one of the Cities of the <HI>Vocontii,</HI> and seems to have been pretty considerable. But it has been so oft ran∣sack'd and plunder'd by the <HI>Goths, Vandales,</HI> and <HI>Sarracens,</HI> that there is but a heap of ruins, where it formerly laid, <HI>viz.</HI> in the plain, about the Church of our Lady.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Principality of <HI>Orange.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Put here this Principality, because it can∣not be describ'd any where else, since it's included by the County <HI>Venaissin</HI> on all sides, save on the West by the <HI>Rhone.</HI> It is very small, though its Territory be extraordi∣nary fertil in Wine, Corn, Fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for its greatest length East and West, is but 5 Leagues, and not quite 4 North and South. That it be∣longs by right to His Majesty <HI>William</HI> III. as part of his Patrimonial Estate is undeniable; though to put an affront, if it were possible, upon that great Prince, the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> have adjudg'd it to <HI>Charles Paris</HI> of <HI>Or∣leans</HI> last Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> kill'd in the <HI>Dutch</HI> War of 1672; and tho <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. pre∣tending to be his Heir, lords now over it, as though it were his own. But to determine whe∣ther the <HI>French</HI> Kings, as Counts and Marquesses of <HI>Provence,</HI> are Lords Paramount of this Prin∣cipality, would require too long a discussion. I shall only observe, 1st. That in 793 <HI>William au Cornet</HI> or <HI>au Court-nez,</HI> High Constable of <HI>France,</HI> having conquered <HI>Orange</HI> from a <HI>Sarracen</HI> King called <HI>Theobard,</HI> took the Title of <HI>Count by the Grace of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> which was then proper to Sove∣reigns. 2dly.

<P>The City of ORANGE, <HI>Aurasio Cavarum,</HI> or <HI>Secundanorum Colonia,</HI> lies a League West of the <HI>Rhone,</HI> and 6 North of <HI>Avignon,</HI> with the Title of Principality, and a Bishoprick Suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agan of <HI>Arles:</HI> This was formerly a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony of the second Legion; there are still to be seen the remains of a <HI>Cinque,</HI> and a Triumphal Arch al∣most whole. There was a kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f little Parlia∣ment, whose Members were one half Roman Catholicks, and the other Protestants, but it was cashier'd by the <HI>French</HI> King in 1687, and changed into a Viguiers Jurisdiction, under the Parliament of <HI>Aix.</HI> It has still a Mint, and an University. Its strong Cittadel, and other For∣tifications were razed in 1660. against the A∣greement made some Months before with Count <HI>Dhona</HI> Governour of the Town. The Prote∣stant Religion was forbidden there; though there are 12 or 15 Jewish Families offered in the City, and above as many in the dependen∣cies of it.</P>
<P>The other places of note are, <HI>Caderousse, Courtezon, Jonquieres, Vaqueyras,</HI> and <HI>Gigondas;</HI> but formerly this Principality extended much farther within <HI>Tricastinois, Diois, Valentinois, Ga∣pencois, Sisteronnois,</HI> the County of <HI>Nice,</HI> the County <HI>Venaissin,</HI> and even beyond the <HI>Rhone</HI>

<P>Almost two Leagues West of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> upon the meeting of the Rivers, <HI>Vence</HI> and <HI>Isere,</HI> is the Barony of <HI>Sassenage,</HI> famous not only for its Lords, who are the most ancient and considera∣ble in that Province, but especially for two rare things that are reckon'd among the Wonders of <HI>DAPHINE,</HI> namely, some Stones which are said to be very serviceable to cure sore Eyes; and two Hollownesses digg'd in the Rock, and called by the Inhabitants <HI>Cuves</HI> or <HI>Tubs,</HI> which are pretended to be empty the whole year round, execept on the Day of <HI>Epiphany,</HI> tho' no body knows whence it comes, nor whether it retires after that Day. They add further, that there is more or less Water in several years, accord∣ing as the Harvest is to be more or less abun∣dant, which is signified in respect to Corn by one of these Tubs, and in regard of VVine by the other. Divers Authors mention these Tubs, and I have often heard of them, but I never had occasion to examin this pretended wonder, nor did I ever speak▪ with any Man of Repute, who had been an Eye-witness of it, or who gave any credit to this relation.</P>
<P>Half-way between <HI>Grenoble</HI> and <HI>Sassenage,</HI> is <HI>La Tour Sans Venin,</HI> another wonder of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> where 'tis said, that no Venemous Creature can live no more than in <HI>Ireand.</HI></P>
<P>Seven Miles North of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> is <HI>La Grand, Chartreuse,</HI> the chief Habitation of the Cartusian Monks, and the ordinary Residence of the Ge∣neral. It's a magnificent Building in a fine De∣sart, in the middle of steep and rugged Rocks. It was founded in the 11th Century, by one <HI>Bruno,</HI> who weary of the VVorld, retired thi∣ther,
<PB N="625" REF="288"/> and had leave given him, by <HI>Hugh,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> to build there a Chappel, and since a Monastery, which in process of time increased to that height, that it became the Head of the Cartusian Order, and these Solita∣ries, the richest of all the Fryars, as they are still, unless the Jesuits do exceed them. All those who go to pay these Monks a Visit, are kindly received, and entertained by the Dire∣ctors of the House; for the Monks themselves speak to no body, unless it be at cettain Hours, and that in very few words, which is a fair pretence to conceal the gross Ignorance wherein they are kept. They will shew you all the Curiosities thereabouts, without enquiring what Religion you are of, at least it was so, some time before the last Persecution.</P>
<P>Remounting the <HI>Ifere,</HI> nine Leagues North of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> 11 Miles from the <HI>Grand Chartreuse,</HI> and five South of <HI>Montmelian,</HI> lies <HI>Fort de Ba∣raux,</HI> situated on a Mountain near that River. It is not quite so strong as <HI>Montmelian</HI> was of late; however 'tis the Key of <HI>France</HI> on that side. In 1528, <HI>March</HI> 13. the Duke of <HI>Lesdiguieres</HI> took it by Storm from the Leaguers in two hours time.</P>
<P>On the South of the <HI>Isere,</HI> two Leagues East of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> lies the Village of <HI>Giere,</HI> which I mention here for a natural Curiosity, the like I never met with else where; namely, a <HI>Cascade,</HI> or VVater-Fall, that precipitates it self down from a steep Rock, almost as high as the Steeple of <HI>Bow-Church,</HI> and as thick as two Men; and after it has run some steps into a small Rivulet, is brought thorough Lead Pipes into a Garden,
<PB N="626" REF="289"/> where it spouts with an incredible Violence, as high as any Tree; so that if this Place were not neglected, but Art were joined to Nature, it would make the finest VVater-fall and Spout in the VVorld.</P>
<P>The Gardens, and Park of <HI>Vizille,</HI> three Leagues South-west of <HI>Grenoble</HI> are much better kept, because they belong'd to the Dukes of <HI>Lesdiguieres,</HI> which during three Generations, and almost an Age, have enjoy'd the Govern∣ment of <HI>Dauphiné.</HI> The Park is encompassed with Walls of almost three Leagues in circuit. There are small Hills and Vallies, and abun∣dance of all Beasts of Game. There is like∣wise a <HI>Mesnagerie,</HI> where they keep Foreign Birds. But the most considerable piece is what they call, tho somewhat improperly the Casca∣de. for 'tis rather the Bed of a small Brook of a Mile or two in length, pav'd with Free large Stone, and divided into Squares of 5 or 6 Fa∣thoms; so that the Water falls by degrees from the Duke's Pallace to the end of the Park.</P>
<P>The Vally of <HI>Trieves</HI> is considerable for the abundance of its Gentry, and the three Towns of <HI>La mure, Mens</HI> and <HI>Corps.</HI> The resemblance of the Names makes <HI>Holstenius</HI> take the second for the habitation of the ancient <HI>Mimenii,</HI> and the third for that of the <HI>Tricorii.</HI> This Vally is yet famous for a place call'd the <HI>Burning-Fountain,</HI> which was indeed so in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s time, and even about 50 Years ago; but whether that the Sulphureal Steams were then spent, or by some other accident unknown to me, the small Rivulet, that ran over the Burning-place, lies now some steps farther. However, 'tis still
<PB N="627" REF="289"/> admirable enough to see a low place vomit Smoak and Flames, without any appearance of Hollowness or combustible Matter; and that the Minerals, that are the source of those Steams should have lasted Time out of Mind, without any sensible dimunition. And therefore this place is still accounted one of the seven Wonders of <HI>Dauphine.</HI> At night, especially in cold Weather, or when it rains but slowly, the Flames are very sensible; but in the heat of the Day, or after a violent Rain, there appears but a Smoak, which, being put on Fire by kindled Straw, draws out other Vapours; so that the Flame lasteth a considerable time.</P>
<P>The small Country of <HI>Royanez,</HI> the most West∣erly of <HI>GRESIVAƲDAN,</HI> along the <HI>Isere,</HI> has two Marquisates, <HI>La Baume</HI> and <HI>Pont de Royan,</HI> which last is a large Burough, where the Pro∣testants had a Church, and a Minister that made himself known of late, several ways.</P>

Besides <HI>Vasio,</HI> the <HI>Vocontii</HI> had 21 Towns more, among which, <HI>Lucus Augusti,</HI> and <HI>Dea Vocontiorum,</HI> were the most considerable; the first is now but a Village, call'd <HI>Luc,</HI> near a Lake of that Name, almost six Leagues South-East of <HI>Die.</HI> All the ancient Historians agree, that <HI>Hanni∣bal</HI> went thorough the Land of the <HI>Vocontii,</HI> towards <HI>Pignerol,</HI> in order to pass the <HI>Alps,</HI> and descend into <HI>Italy.</HI> But this Country is much more considerable, for having produced one of the best Historians <HI>Rome</HI> ever saw, and whose loss is most deplorable, <HI>viz. Trogus Pom∣peius.</HI></P>
<P>This County is Mountainous all over, tho' fruitful in Wine and Corn, and aboundant with Pasture-ground. The most remarkable is <HI>Mont-Aiguille,</HI>
<PB N="629" REF="290"/> or the unaccessible Mountain, five Leagues North-East of <HI>Die,</HI> near a Village cal∣led <HI>Chessiliane.</HI> One can go up to the height of a quarter of a Mile, but then it rises so steep for almost a Mile, that no sort of Animal was ever able to go to the top of it, which appears by the Grass and Weeds that are overgrown there.</P>
<P>Near this Mountain is the Vally of <HI>Vercors,</HI> which keeps yet something of the Name of the <HI>Vocontii,</HI> or rather of a small Tract of Land be∣longing to them, and called <HI>Vertacomicoros. Die,</HI> upon the <HI>Drome,</HI> lies 16 Leagues South of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> and 11 South-west of <HI>Valence,</HI> is the <HI>Dea Vocontiorum,</HI> and a Colony of the <HI>Romans,</HI> built or repair'd in honour of <HI>Livia, Augustus</HI>'s Wife; and therefore sometimes called <HI>Dea Au∣gusta.</HI> It has a Bayliwick, and a Bishoprick, which was united to that of <HI>Valence</HI> in 1275, but was again separated from it in 1687.</P>
<P>This Town was full of Protestants before the the last Persecution, because they had there a Colledge and University proper to them, for Philosophy and Divinity. The <HI>Lombards</HI> be∣came Masters of <HI>Die</HI> in 1514; and after the last dismembring of the Kingdom of <HI>Arles</HI> or <HI>Bur∣gundy,</HI> the Sovereignty of it was usurped by the Bishops, or some Lords under them. They bore the Title of Counts, and were issued from the House of <HI>Forcalquier,</HI> who possessed it du∣ring the 11 and 12th Century; at the end of which it passed to the House of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> who already enjoyed the County of <HI>Valentimois,</HI> but <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Poictiers</HI> sold them both to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the VI. in 1404; and so they were united to the rest of the Province.
<PB N="630" REF="291"/> The Protestants took this Town twice during the civil Wars in 1577 and 1585; and the last time raz'd the Cittadel. The most ancient Bishop of <HI>Die</HI> remembred in History is one <HI>Martius;</HI> for St. <HI>Nicaise,</HI> who was the sole Prelate of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> that assisted to the first Council of <HI>Nice</HI> was but the 5th in Order.</P>
<P>Three Miles North-west of <HI>Die</HI> is the Village of <HI>Quint</HI> on the meeting of the Rivers <HI>Sure</HI> and <HI>Drome.</HI> It gives name to a Mountain whence it rises, three Leagues North-west of the Vil∣lage of <HI>Saillans,</HI> which <HI>Ortelius</HI> and <HI>Holstein,</HI> sup∣pose to be some remains of the ancient <HI>Sega∣launi;</HI> but <HI>Adrian de Valois</HI> proves that accord∣ing to the geni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, <HI>Sail∣lans</HI> cannot be derived from thence.

During the Civil Wars of <HI>Otho</HI> and <HI>Vitellius</HI> a Captain of the last took <HI>Vienne</HI> in his possession; and while this Emperor was sitting on the Tribunal Seat, a Cock light'd on his shoul∣ders, and then on his head, signifying as the <HI>Augures</HI> explain'd it, that he should fall into the hands of a <HI>Gaulish</HI> Man; and so it happened, for the first who defeated him was one <HI>Antony</HI> of <HI>Tolosa</HI> Nickname <HI>Becco,</HI> or <HI>Cock-beak.

<P>Besides all this <HI>Vienne</HI> is remarkable for the Banishment of <HI>Archelaus, Herode</HI> the Great's Son and Successor; for being the Native Country of <HI>Valerius Asiaticus,</HI> who was twice Consul, which shews that the <HI>Viennois</HI> were a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens born, and might become Senators in that Capital of the World. There also it was that <HI>Julianus Caesar</HI> began his Consulship by the Celebration of solemn Games; that the Empe∣ror <HI>Valentinian</HI> the young was kill'd by Count <HI>Arbogast; Constant</HI> the Usurper by <HI>Gerontius,</HI> and <HI>Godegile</HI> Prince of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> by his Bro∣ther <HI>Gondebaud.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> had adorned <HI>Vienne,</HI> in which they much delighted, with several Magnificent Buildings, as an Amphitheatre, an Aqueduct, a Palace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereof there are still consider∣able remains, and this is not at all strange, since <HI>Vienne</HI> was the Capital of the <HI>Narbonnoise,</HI> which they first conquered and beautified above the rest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Burgundians</HI> were the first, who took this Town from the <HI>Romans,</HI> and made it the head of their Kingdoms, but after they had been subdued by the <HI>French, Vienne</HI> remained united to that Monarchy, till it became part of a second Kingdom of the <HI>Burgundians</HI> in <HI>Charles</HI> the Simple's time. At the dismem∣bring of this new Realm, it passed under the Power of the <HI>Dauphins,</HI> who intitled themselves <HI>Dauphins</HI> of <HI>Viennois</HI> and Counts of <HI>Albon,</HI> a Ca∣stle along the <HI>Rhone</HI> between <HI>Vienne</HI> and <HI>Va∣lance.</HI> It will be worth our enquiry to see how this great Town is by degrees fallen to the low State it is now in, for 'tis hardly extended a
<PB N="644" REF="298"/> Mile in length from <HI>Lyons</HI> Gate to that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Avignon,</HI> and its breath comes not near it. <HI>Vi∣enne</HI> was then at first the Capital City of the <HI>Narbonnoise,</HI> that is of <HI>Savoy, Dauphine, Pro∣vence</HI> and <HI>Languedoc;</HI> and when it was conver∣ted to Christianity its Metropolitan, had under him the Bishops of all their Provinces. And indeed the first Christians of <HI>Vienne,</HI> besides the Dignity of their Town, seem'd to des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve that honour; for they not only confessed the name of our Saviour in the middle of a cruel Perse∣cution, under the Emperor <HI>Decius,</HI> but also en∣couraged the other faithful by their Writings and Examples, as may be seen by a Letter, which <HI>Eusebius</HI> has inserted in his Ecclesiastical History. Soon after the <HI>Narbonnoise</HI> was subdi∣vided into 5 Provinces, of which the <HI>Viennoise</HI> had the honour to be the first, and had 13 Epis∣copal Cities depending on it. In process of time <HI>Arles,</HI> one of its Suffragans growing in Wealth and bigness, was erected into an Arch∣bishoprick, and deprived its Metropolitan of seven of its Suffragans, of which however it kept but 4, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Paul Trois Chasteaux, Orange, Marseille</HI> and <HI>Toulon;</HI> the Popes making after∣wards their dear <HI>Avignon</HI> an Archbishoprick, and subjecting to it the Cities of <HI>Vaison, Cava∣illon,</HI> and <HI>Carpentras;</HI> so that the Metropolitan of <HI>Vienne,</HI> has now but 5 real Suffragans, <HI>viz. Valence, Die, Viviers, Grenoble,</HI> and St. <HI>John de Maurienne,</HI> to which may be added the Titular Bishop of <HI>Geneve.</HI></P>
<P>But the greatest unhappiness of <HI>Vienne</HI> came from that which was designed to keep the lu∣stre of its Metropolitans, namely, the Gift which
<PB N="645" REF="298"/> the Emperors made to them of the Sovereignty of the Town; for this caused several broils be∣twixt these Prelates and the <HI>Dauphins,</HI> which by succession of time much depopulated this ancient City, so that in 1448, the Archbishops were forced at last to yield up their Right to <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIth. then <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and afterwards King of <HI>France.</HI> The name of this easie Pre∣late was <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> whose Successors have been ever since in a little esteem, whereas his Predecessors made a great figure in the World. <HI>Vienne</HI> has had the Privilege of coyn∣ing Money, as appears by several pieces, bear∣ing its name under the first and second race of the <HI>French</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>Thirteen Miles North East of <HI>Vienne,</HI> lies upon a Mountain, the Village of <HI>Ponay,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Chorier</HI> esteems to be the place where the <HI>Epa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nense,</HI> or <HI>Ponense Concilium</HI> was held, after the Conversion of <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in 517. <HI>Adrian de Valois</HI> mentions a Village call'd <HI>Ebao</HI> or <HI>Tortillane,</HI> which 800 years ago belong'd to the Archbishops of <HI>Vienne,</HI> and con∣sequently did not lye far off; and thence in∣fers that <HI>Ebao</HI> and <HI>Epaone</HI> are the same name; but I find no such place, as <HI>Ebao</HI> or <HI>Tortillane</HI> in my Maps.</P>
<P>The first considerable Town after <HI>Vienne</HI> in this Diocese, is <HI>Romans</HI> upon the <HI>Isere,</HI> fifteen Leagues South East of <HI>Vienne,</HI> and 14 West of <HI>Grenoble.</HI> It was originally an Abby founded by one <HI>Bernard</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Vienne,</HI> and call'd <HI>Romanis</HI> or <HI>Romanum Monasterium;</HI> either be∣cause the <HI>Romans</HI> were yet Masters of the Coun∣try, or that he put in Monks and Clerks coming
<PB N="646" REF="299"/> out of <HI>Rome.</HI> Whatever be of that, the Juris∣diction of the Town, formerly belonged to the Collegiate Church of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> but in 1344. Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the VI. made a gift of another Mans property, by transferring it to the <HI>Dau∣phin Humbert,</HI> who yielded him up <HI>Avisan.</HI> 'Tis observed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Situation of this Town, has some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with that of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and espe∣cially a small Hill within its Walls to Mount <HI>Calvaire;</HI> which was the reason that one <HI>Ro∣manet Bossi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who had travelled into the Holy Land, erected there a Building representing the St. <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> with a Monastery for <HI>Franciscan</HI> Fryers, in 1520.

<P>St. <HI>Marcellin</HI> 7 Leagues North East of <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> and 8 West of <HI>Grenoble</HI> is the head of a small Bayliwick, that takes up 6 or 7 Leagues of the North end of the Diocese of <HI>Vienne.</HI> On the Borders of this Bayliwick, 8 Leagues North East of St. <HI>Marcellin,</HI> and 6 North of <HI>Greno∣ble</HI> is the Burrough of <HI>Voyron,</HI> where was a fa∣mous Abby, and a goodly Town called in the old <HI>Chartres Visorontia</HI> or <HI>Veserontia,</HI> if we be∣lieve the Jesuit <HI>Labbe;</HI> for <HI>Adrian de Valois</HI> conjectures more probably, that it is a place still called <HI>Veseronce,</HI> 4 Leagues North East of the Town of <HI>Bourgoin,</HI> one South of the Coun∣ty of <HI>Bouchage,</HI> and 2 West of the <HI>Rhone.</HI></P>
<P>In the same Bayliwick, lies the small Town of <HI>Thin</HI> or <HI>Thain,</HI> 7 Miles West of <HI>Romans;</HI> it is seated upon the <HI>Rhone,</HI> over against <HI>Tournon,</HI> from which it is separated by nothing but this River. It must have been of some considera∣tion
<PB N="647" REF="299"/> in the 4th. or 5th. Century, since the Maps of the Emperor <HI>Theodosius</HI> published by the Bro∣thers <HI>Peutingers,</HI> mention it under the name of <HI>Tegna;</HI> 15 Miles North of <HI>Romans</HI> lies the Town of <HI>Moras,</HI> seated upon a Mountain 5 Miles of St. <HI>Rambert</HI> upon the <HI>Rhone.</HI></P>
<P>Going out of the Bayliwick of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> 10 Leagues North of that City, you meet with the Town of <HI>Pont de Beauvoisin Pons Bellovi∣cinus,</HI> so called, because it is built upon the River <HI>Giere;</HI> and divided into two parts, uni∣ted by a Bridge. This part of <HI>Viennois</HI> is all mountainous, as well as <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Bresse</HI> upon which it borders. The Inhabitants name it <HI>Terres Froides,</HI> and made a great Traffick of the Vipers, which abound in their Country. Six leagues West of <HI>Pont de Beauvoisin</HI> is the fa∣mous Barony of <HI>La Tour du Pin,</HI> of which the <HI>Dauphins</HI> bore the Title. On this Barony for∣merly depended the Town of <HI>Bourgoin,</HI> which lies three Leagues farther to the West, and is renowned for its Trade of Hemp. Five Leagues North of <HI>Bourgoin,</HI> lies the Burrough of <HI>Cremieu,</HI> in Latin <HI>Stramiacum,</HI> where the Emperor <HI>Lewis the Meek</HI> kept an Assembly in 836. The Bur∣rough of <HI>Anton</HI> upon the <HI>Rhone,</HI> 7 Leagues East of <HI>Lyons,</HI> seems to have been built or beautified by <HI>Marc Antony</HI> the <HI>Triumvir,</HI> both by its Latin name <HI>Antoniacum,</HI> and by these Verses of <HI>Sido∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius Apollinaris.</HI></P>

<P>THis Country, included between the <HI>Rhone</HI> and <HI>Isere,</HI> the Bayliwick of <HI>Die,</HI> and the <HI>Tricastinois,</HI> reaches 20 Leagues North and South, but hardly 6 or 8 East and West. The Southern part is more mountainous, the Northern more plain, but both abundant with all the conveniencies of life. The Capital <HI>Va∣lance,</HI> lies upon the <HI>Rhone</HI> 6 Leagues South West of <HI>Romans,</HI> and 18 of <HI>Grenoble:</HI> The La∣tins call it <HI>Valentia,</HI> or <HI>Julia Vallentia;</HI> because of its strength, and of the Colony they had transported there. In their time it was Inhabi∣ted by the <HI>Segalauni,</HI> one of the chief People of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> and their Dominions extended even beyond the <HI>Rhone,</HI> since <HI>Tournon</HI> was in their Jurisdiction. <HI>VALENTINOIS</HI> was e∣rected into a Sovereign County, at the dismem∣bring of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, under the Suc∣cessors of <HI>Charlemaign.</HI> The first Count there∣of remember'd in History is one <HI>Gontard,</HI> who lived in 950, and who by the Sirname of <HI>Poi∣ctiers,</HI> which he left to his Successors, seems to be descended from the antient Dukes of <HI>Aqui∣tain.</HI> I have observ'd how <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> yielded his Dominions to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> the XI. who united them to the rest of
<PB N="650" REF="301"/> <HI>Dauphiné. Lewis</HI> the XII. erected this County into a Dukedom, for <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> Son to Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the VI. but the Lords of <HI>Poictiers</HI> made a solemn protestation against it, preten∣ding their Father could not deprive them of their Inheritance. The Suit was along time depending before the Parliament of <HI>Grenoble;</HI> but what their good Right could not get was obtained by the Beauty of a Lady of that House, <HI>Diane</HI> of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> Mistress to <HI>Francis</HI> the I. who easily prevailed upon that King to present her with the contested Dutchy, which after her death was united again to the <HI>French</HI> Crown. <HI>Valence</HI> is the head of a Seneschalship, to which the Vice-seneschalships of <HI>Crest</HI> and <HI>Montlimar</HI> are resorting. It has likewise a Presidial-seat and Election, and an University for the Civil and Cannon Law, wherein Doctors are made, and the Famous <HI>Cujas</HI> has taught.</P>
<P>Its Bishop is Suffragan to <HI>Vienne,</HI> and the first is one <HI>Emilian.</HI> Its Cathedral is dedicated to another of its Prelates, called St. <HI>Apollinaire:</HI> But I must not forget that famous <HI>Nicodemite John</HI> of <HI>Montluc,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Valence,</HI> who liv'd under the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> I. <HI>Henry</HI> II. and his three Sons, and was one of the most Learned Men of his time. He favoured the Protestant Doctrine openly enough, and often Preached it at Court. But whether he could not as easily resolve to for sake his Kitchin as Transubstan∣tiation, as he himself used to say; or that he thought that his stay at Court would be more serviceable to the good side, than a publick ab∣juration; or that he did not like a Presbyterian Reformation; as 'tis reported that when the
<PB N="651" REF="301"/> Ministers of <HI>Geneve</HI> wrote to him, he should come over to them to make a publick Profes∣sion of the Truth; he answer'd they ought ra∣ther to come to, and take orders from him, they having no lawful Mission; whatsoever it may be, he dyed in the Communion of the Ro∣man Church, at <HI>Toulouse</HI> in 1579. Among the Monasteries of <HI>Valence</HI> is most eminent, the Abby of St. <HI>Ruff</HI> chief of the Order of St. <HI>Au∣gustin,</HI> esteemed one of the most sumptuous Buildings of all <HI>Dauphine.</HI> The Foundation of this Town is uncertain, but it appears by seve∣ral Inscriptions and Roman Monuments, that it is very antient. It is divided into Town and Burrough, and is defended by a Cittadel; for the other Fortifications which <HI>Francis</HI> the I. designed to make at <HI>Grenoble</HI> and <HI>Valence</HI> were never finished. In the Town are two Fountains, whose Conduits said to have been built by <HI>Ju∣lius Caesar,</HI> are indeed a Work of the Roman Magnificence; for they are vaulted, and so big that a Man may walk upright in them: the source and the end of one cannot be discovered, and along the other, which waters the Neigh∣bouring Meadows, are the ruins of several an∣tient Buildings. The Country People do not want fabulous Traditions, no more than their Neighbours at <HI>Vienne;</HI> for they will tell you strange Stories of a Giant called <HI>Briard,</HI> who was 15 Cubits high, and shew you some mon∣strous remains of his Bones; nay the <HI>Domini∣can</HI> Fryers assure, that they have still his true Picture, which they do not fail to shew to Strangers.</P>
<PB N="652" REF="302"/>
<P><HI>Duchesne</HI> relates, that in the Neighbouring Vineyards was discovered a Grave, at the open∣ing of which was seen a Woman, having a golden Ring at each of her ears, with a Turky-stone and Emerald inchased in them; at her Feet was a Cup of Cristal, and at her Head a Lamp of Glass, but assoon as this dead Body was exposed to the piercing Air, it turned in∣to dust. Between <HI>Valence</HI> and the fall of the <HI>Isere</HI> into the <HI>Rhone,</HI> at a Leagues distance from both is the Village of <HI>Confolen,</HI> where <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> gave a total overthrow to the <HI>Gaulish</HI> Forces, in the Year 633 of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Thirteen Miles South-East of <HI>Valence,</HI> upon the River <HI>Drome,</HI> lies the Town of <HI>Crest,</HI> for∣merly a dependance of the <HI>Segalauni,</HI> and a Castle of the Counts of VALENTINOIS. This <HI>French</HI> name is derived from the Latin <HI>Crista;</HI> because this Castle being seated between the River and a Neighbouring Mountain, appear'd as the Cap or the Comb of a Cock; and there∣fore it was the place of Arms of the Counts of VALENTINOIS, and the Count of <HI>Mont∣fort</HI> besieged it in vain, in the 13th. Age. As this Town is conveniently seated between the Diocesses of <HI>Valence</HI> and <HI>Die,</HI> so it was the Seat of Justice for the upper part of both Counties. 'Tis observed, that in 1469, one <HI>John Rabot</HI> made a new Statute-Book divided in a hundred Articles, which were afterwards confirmed by the Parliament of <HI>Dauphiné. Crest</HI> had declared it self for the League in the last Century, but its Governor <HI>Montoison</HI> surrender'd it to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, in 1589, and since that time its Tower has been demolished.

<P><HI>Lyons,</HI> the chief City of this division, and of the whole Government, is seated on the Con∣fluence of the <HI>Rhone</HI> and the <HI>Saone;</HI> Its Situation is very pleasant, its Original antient, and its Trade the greatest in the Kingdom; so that <HI>Lyons</HI> is generally esteem'd one of the Principal Cities of <HI>Europe.</HI> Here is an Archbishop, who is Primate of the <HI>Celtick Gaulae,</HI> the Archbishops of <HI>Rouen, Tours</HI> and <HI>Sens</HI> depending by right upon him, as <HI>Metropolitans</HI> of the second, third, and fourth <HI>Lyonnoise;</HI> to whom may be now ad∣ded

<P>Authors vary very much about the Founda∣tion of <HI>Lyons,</HI> and the Original of its Name. Some say that <HI>Lugdus</HI> King of the <HI>Celtes</HI> was the Foun∣der of it; so that from <HI>Lugdus</HI> and <HI>Dunum</HI> (which signifies a Mountain) did arise <HI>Lugdi∣dunum,</HI> or <HI>Lugdunum;</HI> some will have it to come from <HI>Lug</HI> (which in the <HI>Cimbrique</HI> Tongue signifieth <HI>Fortune</HI>) and <HI>Dunum</HI> a Hill, that is the Hill, or Mountain of <HI>Fortune;</HI> others from two <HI>Gaulish</HI> words <HI>Lugo-dunum,</HI> which they inter∣pret the <HI>Mountain of the Raves.</HI> And others a∣gain from <HI>Lucius Plancus,</HI> who by order of the Senate brought thither a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony from <HI>Vienne.</HI> It is sure that before that time, that is before the Triumvirate, <HI>Lyons</HI> was already a considerable City, though not so famous as it be∣came afterwards.</P>
<P>In 744 of <HI>Rome,</HI> 60 <HI>Gaulish</HI> Cities contribu∣ted towards the erection of an Altar, dedicated to <HI>Augustus,</HI> and built on the confluence of the <HI>Saone</HI> and <HI>Rhone,</HI> at a place call'd <HI>Ainay,</HI> where is still a famous Abby of <HI>Benedictins.</HI> Here <HI>Caius Caesar</HI> celebrated Games, and Prises were given to those that deliver'd the best Discourse in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>Under the Empire of <HI>Nero,</HI> a great part of this City was burnt down, to whose rebuilding
<PB N="660" REF="306"/> this Emperor gave out of his Exchequer 400000 Sesterces, as much as they themselves had con∣tributed before in troublesome times. This made the <HI>LYONNOIS</HI> so faithful to his interest, that they withstood <HI>Galba,</HI> and stuck to the false <HI>Nero,</HI> until they were undeceiv'd.</P>
<P>In <HI>Antonine</HI>'s time, there was an Amphithe∣atre, which according to an ancient Chronicle, had been built by the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> at a place call'd now <HI>Serviere,</HI> where stands the Collegiate Church of S. <HI>Thomas.</HI> In the Collegiate Church of S. <HI>John</HI> the Canons have the Title of Counts, and the Dean that of Duke.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Of the Government of <HI>Burgundy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT the beginning of the 5th Century, un∣der the Empire of <HI>Honorius,</HI> the <HI>Burgun∣dians, Burgundiones,</HI> a <HI>German</HI> Nation entred into the <HI>Gaules,</HI> and having conquered several Countries from the <HI>Romans,</HI> their King <HI>Gaudisele</HI> laid there the Foundation of a Realm in 408, which under his Successor <HI>Gaudicare,</HI> in 413 took the name of its Conquerors, and was called the Kingdom of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> whereof <HI>Vien∣ne</HI> in <HI>Dauphiné</HI> was the Capital. It was made up of some Provinces of the <HI>Narbonnoise</HI> and <HI>Celtick Gaule,</HI> comprehending <HI>Switzerland, Sa∣voy, Dauphiné,</HI> the Northern part of <HI>Provence, Burgundy</HI> Dutchy and County. As they were War-like, and of a Stature that frighted the <HI>Galli</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> (for <HI>Sidonius Apollinary</HI> de∣scribes them, as being 7 Foot high) they would have extended their Dominions farther; but tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>French</HI> on the North, and the <HI>Wisigoths</HI> on the South and West, that were as barbarous, and as great Warriors as they, opposed their Progresses. By the Conquest of <HI>Clovis,</HI> the
<PB N="679" REF="315"/> <HI>French</HI> having brought the <HI>Wisigoths</HI> very low, his Sons after his Death attack'd the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> and <HI>Childebert,</HI> and <HI>Clotaire,</HI> having kill'd or routed <HI>Godomar</HI> the IX. and last King of that Nation, in 527, their Empire finished 119 af∣ter its beginning.

<P>After this defeat, nothing remained of the ancient Kingdom of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> but the Name; for it was subject to the <HI>French</HI> during 340 years, until the Divisions of <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> or <HI>Lewis</HI> the Meek's Successors gave occasion to one <HI>Beuves,</HI> or <HI>Beuvon,</HI> to usurp the Soveraignty of it un∣der <HI>Charles the Bald.

<P>THis Diocese included betwixt <HI>Auxois, Di∣jonnois, Bresse, Charollois</HI> and <HI>Nivernois,</HI> is but a very small part of the Dominions of the ancient <HI>Aedui,</HI> which reach'd North and South from the Country of the <HI>Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nois</HI> to the <HI>Cevennes,</HI> and extended East and West from the <HI>Rhone</HI> and the <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne</HI> to the <HI>Loire,</HI> and a good way be∣yond it, comprehending besides the Dutchy of <HI>Burgundy, Nivernois, Bourbonnois, Bresse, Forez, Beau∣jolois</HI> and <HI>Lyonnois;</HI> for the <HI>Segusiani,</HI> who in∣habited the three last Countries, and part of <HI>Bresse</HI> were Tributaries of the <HI>Autunois,</HI> and even the <HI>Senonois</HI> were under their Protection.</P>
<P>The <HI>Autunois</HI> being so powerful were easily tempted with the desire of making themselves Masters of all the <HI>Gaules;</HI> in order to which, they made Alliance with the <HI>Romans.</HI> But the <HI>Auvergnats</HI> and <HI>Allobroges,</HI> who had as much Power, and perhaps no less Ambition than they, opposed their Design, fought, and beat them, and would utterly have destroyed them, had not the <HI>Autunois</HI> call'd the <HI>Romans</HI> to their help.

<PB N="667" REF="319"/> had already given footing to these Conquerors of the World.</P>
<P>The Contestations of the <HI>Autunois</HI> and <HI>Se∣quani,</HI> or <HI>Frano-Countois,</HI> were the cause of a second coming of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The <HI>Sequani</HI> being too weak for the <HI>Aedui,</HI> had invited the <HI>Germans,</HI> and with their Succors, defeated 'em twice. Upon this, <HI>Divitiacus,</HI> an <HI>Autunois</HI> Lord, was deputed to <HI>Rome,</HI> and Prevailed ea∣sily with the Senate, to send an Army into the <HI>Gaules.</HI> The Great <HI>Caesar</HI> was chosen for this expedition, who knew to make a good use of the Friendship of the <HI>Aedui,</HI> and of the Dissen∣sions of the <HI>Gaules;</HI> so that he overcame them all, one after another. The <HI>Autunois</HI> perceiv'd, but too late, they had been mistaken in their Politicks, and would feign have been rid of the imperious Master they had given to them∣selves, and their Country-men; but the <HI>Gaules</HI> were already exhausted in a manner of Men and Mony; neither had they learn'd the War-Stratagems, and Military Discipline of their Conquerors; so that their League with <HI>Vercin∣gentorix</HI> for the relief of the <HI>Alesia,</HI> one of their Towns avail'd nothing, but to bring them into the contempt of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who deprived them insensibly of their Countries and Privi∣ledges, and made <HI>Lyons</HI> head of the <HI>Celtick Gaules.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Autunois</HI> rais'd a third time under the Emperor <HI>Tiberius,</HI> but with as little success as before. They could never since recover their Liberty, and much less their Empire, but were always subject either to the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Bur∣gundians,</HI> or to the <HI>French.</HI> But the greatest
<PB N="668" REF="320"/> losses the <HI>Autunois</HI> suffer'd, were by the rebellion of the <HI>Bagaudes,</HI> or <HI>Gaulish</HI> Peasants, who plundered the Country, and all the Towns they could Master, under the Conduct of one <HI>Aman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Elian,</HI> but were at last defeated by <HI>Herculi∣us Maximian,</HI> associated to the Empire by <HI>Diocletian,</HI> The two Emperours at the sollici∣tations of <HI>Constantius Chlorus, Caesar,</HI> and after∣wards Emperour of the <HI>Gaules, England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> began to repair <HI>Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un,</HI> which <HI>Constantius,</HI> and <HI>Constantine</HI> his Son finished. For this reason the Senate of <HI>Autun</HI> made a Decree, that their City should be called <HI>Flavia,</HI> and the Inhabi∣tants <HI>Flavienses,</HI> from the proper Name of these two Emperours <HI>Flavius;</HI> but this lasted only as long as the Family of the <HI>Flavians</HI> sat upon the Throne; for they retook afterwards their former Name of <HI>Augustodunum.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while, since <HI>Augustodunum</HI> is compound of a <HI>Gaulish</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> word, signi∣fying the Mountain of <HI>Augustus;</HI> it remains un∣known what was the name of the Capital of the <HI>Aedui,</HI> before that Emperour, for <HI>Bibracte</HI> was a considerable Town, not far from <HI>Autun,</HI> but not <HI>Autun</HI> it self.</P>
<P>In <HI>Constantius</HI> and <HI>Constantine</HI>'s times, there was a Capitole dedicated to <HI>Jupiter, Juno</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> a Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and a famous School for Rhetorick and Humane Learning.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Auntunois</HI> were reduced into a <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Province, they govern'd themselves as a Common-wealth, chusing every Year a Sove∣reign Magistrate, call'd <HI>Vergo-brete,</HI> who had absolute Power of Life and Death, and over their Goods.

In 274. this plantation rais'd a Triomphal Arch in honour of <HI>Aurelian</HI> the Em∣perour; but some years after it was plunder'd and ruin'd by the <HI>Alamanni</HI> under their King <HI>Crocus;</HI> so that it was in a pitiful condition in 366. It had scarce been repair'd when the <HI>Fandals</HI> besieg'd it in vain in 406. The <HI>Bur∣gundians</HI> were more successful in 413. but <HI>Attilae</HI> destroy'd it a second time, in 451 or 452. it was afterwards rebuilt in the form it has now, somewhat different from what it was in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omans</HI> time. The River <HI>Dou</HI> separates it into two parts, of which the biggest resembles a Peninsula, and is clos'd up by a hill, whereon the Cittadel was built. <HI>Besancon</HI> has still an Archbishoprik, of which <HI>Belay</HI> and the titular Bishop of <HI>Lausanne</HI> and <HI>Basil</HI> are suffragans. The Chapter is compos'd of a Dean, an Archdeacon a Singer, a Treasurer, two Under-Singers, 43. Canons, and 24 Chaplains.

Since <HI>Franche-County</HI> is in the power of the French the Parliament and Chamber of Accounts, which had their Seat at <HI>Dole,</HI> have been transfer'd hither; so that <HI>Besancon</HI> may now be accounted, the Capital of this Province.</P>
<P><HI>DOLE Dola,</HI> is situated on the <HI>Dou,</HI> in a very pleasant and fertil Country and is still the Seat of the Baily of this Division.
