<HEAD>The Wonderful Deliverance at SEA.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an Observation in sacred Scripture, <HI>That those that go down to the Sea in ships see the wonders of the Lord in the deep;</HI> which was fully made good in this miraculous deliverance, that we are here to relate; which happened but the very last month in our own Seas, and to persons of our own Nation.</P>
<P>IN the second Week of the month of <HI>November</HI> last past, a small Vessel called the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Dorothy,</HI> fell down out of the River intending to steer along the Coasts to <HI>New-castle,</HI> haveing on board of Seamen and Passengers about five and twen∣ty persons; They sail'd with a fair wind and good weather till they came off of <HI>Flamborough-Head</HI> (a small Promontory in <HI>Yorkshire</HI>) where being surprized with a storm, they were driven out to Sea, and the rough

<PB N="4" REF="3"/>among them, chewing of it in their mouths, which (providence so ordering of it) nourished them so as to preserve their lives, but continuing floating up and down thus eight days and Nights, the poor Child starved with cold and hunger; upon which a great dispute arose amongst them whether they should not devour its raw flesh being in that excessive exi∣gency; but at last the intreaties of its Mother, and considerations of humanity prevailed so far with 'um as to suffer it to be flung over board to be buried in the vast abiss of Waters.</P>
<P>It would be easie here to draw Tears from every compassionate Readers eyes by a pathetical discripti∣on of these poor forlorn Wretches condition, but in∣deed Words are too little to express it to the Life, and we must leave it to his imagination to draw a true <HI>Idea</HI> of their misery, which none can fully do, but such as are sensible by experience of the torment∣ing effects of Famine, and a prospect of Inevitable Death continually before their eyes, and have them∣selves born a share in some such like grievous calami∣ty. It may sound like a Romantick action, but it is a most serious and well known Truth that they con∣tinued driving forwards and backwards as the wind shifted its points, in this manner for the space of eight days longer. And it cannot be denyed, that nothing but the special and extraordinary provi∣dence of Heaven could have so long preserved them, that they were not overturn'd by the Winds, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allowed up by the Waves, or dash'd to pieces
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>against Rocks, or at least that they were not ut∣terly pined and famished for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood is next to a miracle if we may not truly count it one: but that over-ruling power that stills the rageing of the Sea, and bounds it at his pleasure, was graciously pleased to hear their cry, to support languishing nature even against hope, and calm the Ocean for their safety.</P>
<P>Insomuch that after eight days fluctuation they were cast upon the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> and driven ashore on the Isle, where the inhabitants seeing so small a Boat come off from Sea, with persons in it, concluding them to be the remnants of some wrack, charitably went down to receive them; they were all exceeding weak, not able at first to speak or go; but being taken in by the people, and put into warm Beds, and supplyed with Cordials to restore their spirits, they in short time recovered, and related all the particulars of their distress in manner afore∣said; and from thence after some space of refreshing were carried in a ship to <HI>Harlingen,</HI> and so came to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where the young man continues, but the three women took the opportunity of a Vessel bound for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to go thither, being of that Nation; and the old man came over to <HI>England</HI> in the Pacquet-Boat; and does with much thanksgiving relate Gods Wonderful Mercy in this great and miraculous deli∣verance.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>As for the rest of their ships crew, which were ta∣ken up before by the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Caper, they were set on shore in <HI>Lincoln-shire,</HI> and divers of them were seve∣ral days ago arrived at <HI>London,</HI> confidently reporting these five persons to have been cast away, as they had all the reason in the world to imagine, till the sight of the old man convinced them of that mistake.</P>
<P>Thus may we from this certain Relation take oc∣casion to magnifie the Lord for his mercies, and learn to put all our trust in the Arm of his might, when surrounded with the greatest straights and distresses; when Art is baffled, and nature finks, and the spirits faint, and hope it self dispairs, then can he command relief and deliverance. Oh! who would not trust in so great a God? who would not love and adore so good a God?</P>
