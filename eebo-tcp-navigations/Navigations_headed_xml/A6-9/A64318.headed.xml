<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mong Arts and Sciences Mathematical Gun∣nery will not deserve the least respect which has been practised for many years (as you may read in the first Chapter of this Book where we treat of its Original) and from time to time Necessity and Art together have produced many new Invention: so that some may judge it almost impossible to add more unto this Art; and are ready to say of this as of other Studies,</HI> Nil dictum quod non dictum prius. <HI>But we have not only indeavoured the inquisition into the most knowing Professors of these Arts both</HI> German, Italian, Frenchmen, Netherlander, <HI>&amp;c. from whence we have drawn the more Excellent and useful parts which were never before in our</HI> English <HI>Tongue; but may boldly ad∣venture to call some things in it new: And finding the great Occasion which these present times do require in the knowledge of these things made me the readier to compose this Work, adjudging it a very great in∣jury to our Country-men to be deprived of the knowledge of such things which are of so great importance in this ve∣ry juncture of time.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Treating of the Earth necessary in making of Molds for the Casting of Pieces of Ordnance, with the manner of Casting,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E will not dispute of the first Invention of Guns, that is, whe∣ther it came from <HI>Archimedes,</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> do report, or from an <HI>Englishman,</HI> or from a <HI>Monk,</HI> for this knowledge matters not much to the Art, nor is it of any profitable signi∣fication to the Artist; especially considering, that Authors do not really consent in this thing. Our intent is therefore not to trouble the ingenious Students with vain uncertain repeti∣tions, but to composea compleat Piece of Gunnery, and there∣in to discourse from the beginning to the end, all that is necessary to be known or learned (after the knowledge of common Arithmetick) by one that intends to be a perfect Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icient in the said Art. We do suppose it therefore necessary for a Ma∣ster Gunner to know first the making of Molds and casting of Pieces. Therefore I shall first begin to discourse of the property and Nature of the Earth fit for casting, or making Molds; for this is of great moment, considering that many, or indeed most Earths are not for this purpose; for the Earth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t for the casting of Pieces of Ordnance must be such as will not be melted or fuse, although it be put into a very great fire, but must remain firm and hard: and these Earths are generally of a Red∣dish, or Iron-like colour, which is well known to many Potters, especially such as make <HI>Chymical</HI> Vessels. The Earth being obtained, it must be sifted and cast up after the usual manner, as men do in the making of Morter; then let it be moistned with an Alchalated Water (especially such as is made of Niter) for that purpose, and make it like paste; then, as is usual, let it be beaten up strongly with an Iron Bar; the more 'tis beaten the better it is: in the beating add one sixt part of Horse dung, and a proportionable part of Flox or Hair, and let it again be well beaten and incor∣porated, alwayes keeping a Moity of this Earth without Hair or Flox, which is for Ground-work; and these Compositions or Earth thus incorporated, you must reserve for the making your Molds for Pieces of Ordnance, according to the Rules prescribed in the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of making Molds, and Casting Pieces of Ordnance, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ture of Metals, and allowance of Powder for proof.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS a Master Builder when he intends the Building a Ship, makes first a Mold or Moddel of the same; so the Master Gunner, or he that takes in hand the business of Casting Guns, must have a form or Model of his Piece intended made of wood, or such other matter he may think most convenient, which then being brought to the Founder with an intent to be Cast, must first be smeered all over with Palm Oyle, or instead of that, our Lard or Hogs-grease, then first cover it over with the said earth thinly, and let it dry leisurely, then lay on more, encreasing it to such a thickness, as you may judge convenient for your purpose; and it must be so made that it may be taken into several parts, so that the pattern may be taken out, and the Mold again exactly closed, and the outside strengthned with Iron plates as long as the Chace of the Piece is, and hooped together with Iron hoops to knock on and off. Then must there be made (with the same earth upon a square Bar of Iron, bound round with a Cord that the clay may stick well) a form exactly round, of the fashion of the concave of your Piece (whether you intend it a Cylender or a Chamber∣board Piece) proportioned both in length and diameter, and it must be placed exact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the middle of the concave; and when all is well joyned together, be sure it be well pollished and smoothed, that the Metal may run the better, and be the clearer from flaws, holes, or clefts.</P>
<P>In the beginning of your work take care that your Mold be exactly propor∣tionable as to heighth and substantialness of Metal, according to the nature of the Piece you intend. That is, the Canon double-fortified must be so cast that the Dia∣meter at Muzzle be but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Diameter at Britch. The lesser Cannon at Britch to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o big as the greater Cannon 9/16 at Trunions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Muzzle, whereas ordinary fortified Cannons have at the Touch-hole 7/8 at the Trunions 5/8 and at the Muzzle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, all lesser Pieces in that kind have 18/1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Touch-hole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Trunions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Muzzle; and the ordinary fortified Culverins are fortified every way like the double fortified Cannon, and the lesser Culverin like the ordinary fortified Cannon in all respects.</P>
<P>Great care must be taken in the Casting of Pieces of Ordnance, that they be equal every way in proportion of Metals, that is, that the Cylender be in the very middle of the Metal, that it may be truely bored, otherwise your Piece will fail the Artist that shall use it, until the error be known.</P>
<P>In the next place let the Trunions be exactly placed in a Diagonal line with the Axis of the Piece; and they may be placed in their proper distance from the Muzzle and Britch, if you observe these Rules. Take the length of the bore of the Piece from Muzzle to Britch, divide that measure by seven, and multiply that sum that cometh of the Quotient by three, the Product will shew you how many inches the Trunions must stand from the lowest part of the concavity of the Piece.</P>
<P>And farther note, that the Trunions ought to be placed so, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Circum∣ference of the Piece, may be seen in that place where the Trunions are set.</P>
<P>When all additional Patterns, as Britch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be made and Luted in their proper place, all things at pleasure being neatly added to the pattern, let the Mold then be fixt or placed so as is most convenient for the pouring in the Metal; so when
<PB N="3" REF="4"/> the Metal is cast, the perfect impression will be made upon the superficial part of the Piece, and the Cylender will keep the bore proposed according to what you have prescribed, the length of the Piece and its Diameter of the bore may be found by the following Table in the next Chapter. For the Metals generally used for those Guns, generally called brass Guns, they are mixtures, and many times varied as experience will give leave. Some of the chiefest do approve of this mix∣ture, that is, to every hundred Weight of Copper 24 pounds of Tin, and 6 pounds of Lattin. Others to <HI>100l.</HI> of Copper, add 8 <HI>l.</HI> of Tin, and 10 <HI>l.</HI> of Lattin. Others to ever <HI>100l.</HI> add <HI>20l.</HI> of Bell-Metal, which is <HI>25l.</HI> of Lead and Tin to every <HI>100l.</HI> of of Copper. Some add Tin, Lead, Copper, and <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> together; so every one follows such wayes of Composition as doth most please his own Experience. The Copper and other better Metals being once melted, the Tin and Lead is added for the better and quicker fusion; and the higher the Metal is in fusion, the more solid and compact your Metal will run and settle. The Lattin doth incorporate and cause the Piece to be of a good colour, and the Tin doth strengthen and bind the other matters together. Now a Piece of Ordnance being Cast, before it comes to Service, it must be put to tryal; for which purpose there is used for proof, according to the weight of the shot, about two thirds, or four fifths of that weight in Powder, and for smaller Pieces more.</P>

<P><HI>The Names of the Principal parts of a piece of Ordnance.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is necessary for him that intends to be a Gunner to understand, after the know∣ledg of the Piece in general, to know and learn every part and member of a Piece of Ordnance; for well understanding the same take these Instructions following.</P>
<P>All the outside of the Piece round about is called the superficial part of the same, or Surface of the Piece; the Inner part is called the concave Cylinder, and Soul of the Piece.</P>
<P>The full length is called the Chase of the Piece; so much of the Cylinder or con∣cave of the Piece as contains the powder and Shot is called the Chamber or charged Cylinder, the remaining part to the small end of the Gun is called the vacant Cylin∣der.</P>
<P>The Spindle standing out, or Ears by which the Piece must hang in the Carriage, is called the Trunions; the space between the Trunions, the gravity of the Center.</P>
<P>The Pumel or Button at her Coyl or Britch-end is called the Casacabel or her Deck, the little hole the Touch-hole, all the metal behind the touch-hole the Breach or Coyl, the greatest ring at her touch-hole the Base Ring, the next ring or circle the reinforced Ring, the next the Trunion Rings, the next before the Trunions is called the Cornish Ring, the foremost next the Muzzle is called the Muzzle Ring, Lastly, all the rings, Circles, Eminencies, at her Muzzle, and so those behind the base Ring, are Frizes.</P>

<P>Before you endeavour to mount your Piece, above all things have a great and di∣ligent care that the Ghynne be very firmly set, so that it may not slip any way; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so placed, that the Pully or Truckle coming down from the head, fall just between the Trunions, or gravity of the Piece, whereof to be assured you may let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all down from the head of the Ghynne a Plummet with a Line▪ or for want of a Plummet any stone made fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to a Line, and so moving the Ghynne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>til the said Plummet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon the Center of Gravity, which is between the Ears of the Piece, that the met<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l near equal, or that an easie hand may poize i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and this care must be the more, if the Ground whereon the Ghynne stands be sandy or loose Ground, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earth be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggy soft, so that the feet may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>il or sink in or give way▪ according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> the greatness of the weight. For sometimes it may be necessary to put planks or some solid thing under the Ghynne and Pins to stay them; but this as necessity shall require.</P>
<P>Now the Ghynne firmly placed and setled, the Gunner must get up by the Ladder, or some Steps, to the head or top of it, having the Rope in his hand, shall put it through the uppermost truckle of the head, and let it fall down to another man again, that he may catch it, that he may put it through one side of the Piece to fas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en it into the Ears of the Piece, and so having put it through them he may draw it up, until he can give it him that is above, and then put it through the other hole of the Truckle, and give it to him that is under him, who must reach it again to him that is above, and so fasten it to the head of the Ghynne, giving it some turns until it come under the uppermost Truckle.</P>
<P>This done, he must fasten it with great diligence to the lower Truckle, by putting the Ears as through the Ring which is under the said Truckle; after this begin to Hoyse your Peice, and in the Hoysing put a spar or some such thing into the mouth of the Peice, so that thereby it may be governed, and may not sway from one side to the other, which would be dangerous; for if it should strike against the Rouler or any one of the feet of the Gynne, it may break all, and so spoil both the work and the men tending upon it. Therefore I say, be sure that those who stand by the Spar be careful in guiding the Piece and keeping it steddy and right, until the weight of the Piece is well setled, a diligent Eye being had all this while, that nei∣ther the feet of the Gynne, nor Rope give way; and be sure every part of the Rope draw equal, and that there be no Knicks, or that they be not tangled one amongst another; and for that purpose, when they begin to hoyse the Piece, blows must be given upon the Tackling until it be set tort, and all bear equal.</P>
<P>But if you should perceive that the Ghynne or any part give way, presently let your Piece sink, and underlay and settle well the feet of the Ghynne, and that as gently as may be, to the end the Cross beam or Rouler may not be disjoyned or broken.</P>
<P>Then wind it up carefully and very gently by the help of two men onely, and in such a manner, as when one of the Leavers is brought down, it must be held there fast until the other has got purchase, and then must this other also be brought down; this must be reiterated so often until it be so high that the Carriage may be placed under it, so that the Trunions may fall into the Sockets, or holes of the Carriage, and then Guide the Piece by the Spar, so that it fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l easily in, and so rest it self in the Carriage, and then let it be well clasped over, and then locked in and fastned with Forelocks, and so you may draw away your Piece where you please. On board Ships this Ghynne is not of use, it being the Boatswains business to fix a Tackle that may be able to hoist up any Piece into its Carriage, the Slings one part must come about the Casacabel, and the other part about a Billet, so made that it may fit in at the Muzzle, and by strength of hands, or by help of a Windless, or Capstain, it may be hoysed up so that the Carriage may be brought under; so that the Gun being Loared, its Trunions may fall in to the holes of the Carriage, which then clasp over with its Iron Clasps; let them be Forelocked, and then with Hand-Tackles be brought where you please.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The way to draw a Piece of Ordnance, with the necessary things thereunto belonging both for Land and Sea.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SEeing we have discovered the way of Casting a Piece, and Mounting it in its Car∣riage, it follows in the next place that in this Chapter we treat of, and shew the manner of drawing them from place to place, for Service; where care must be taken what the way is that you are to pass, for if the way be foul, moorish, and dirty, there is then required as many more Horses as in good wayes. That is,</P>
<P>For a whole Cannon of 8000 <HI>l.</HI> you may use 15 couple of Horses, besides the Tyllar.</P>
<P>For a Demi-Cannon of about 6000 <HI>l.</HI> you may use 11 couple of Horses, besides the Tyllar.</P>
<P>For a Piece of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> weight, you may use 8 couple of Horses, besides the Tyllar.</P>
<P>For a Field Piece of about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> use 6 couple of Horses, besides the Tyllar.</P>
<P>For a Saker of 1800 <HI>l.</HI> weight, you may use 4 couple of Horses, besides the Tyllar.</P>
<P>For a Piece of 1500 <HI>l.</HI> weight, you may use 3 couple of Horses, besides the Tyllar.</P>
<P>For a Faucon, two couple of Horses, besides the Tyllar. For a small Drake of about 250 <HI>l.</HI> one Horse will serve: and by the same Rule you may find how many Horses will draw any weight whatsoever.</P>
<P>Many times when Horses are wanting, men are made use of: Upon such occasions, you must divide your men into three drawing files, according to the greatness of the Piece; now to the end the Ranks may spread, and every man may draw equally alike, fasten to the end of the Carriage a Cross beam or bar, to which you must fasten the drawing Ropes, equally at such distance, that one may not impead the other, and let there be besure one to steer the Piece when you come to any winding or turn∣ing. If the drawing Ropes be long, 'tis necessary to cross it with Ropes, or some light peeces of wood like a Ladder, with two or more cross peeces; let them be made fast for the better and more steady drawing, and to every there must be a Neck∣line fastned to the Ropes, and so to cast over every mans Sholders, in manner as is used to draw our Western Barges: And you must know your proportion of men fit to draw any Piece of Ordnance, and that must be regulated according to the good∣ness or badness of the way, and so more or less men, allowing every man to draw about 50, 60, or 80 pounds; for 'tis supposed a man may draw in ordinary way 50 or 60 pounds but in very good way more than 80 pounds, however 'tis good to have men enough. Let the Spunge, Ladle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be made fast along the Piece to the Ring and Britch end. Sometimes by reason of the unevenness, steepness, or other defects of the way, it sometimes happens, that you may be forc'd to dis∣mount your Piece, and remount it again; there 'tis necessary every Gunner have with him a Ghynne, a Wynche, and all appurtenances necessary thereunto. As to the Sea Gunner on board Ship, their occasions require no more than the Wynch; and their Piece being mounted according to the directions given in the former Chap∣ter, then with one or two Tackles he bring the Piece to the place desired, where it ought to be well fastned in its place; for which purpose there is thereunto required Tack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and Britchins; and in case of foul weather, or that any of the Gee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Tackling be suspected, or by my much tumbling every thing hanging upon the Nail, for fear any Bolts should give way or draw, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> usual to nail down to the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/> Deck with Spikes, one Coyne behind each Truck, or at least the after Trucks, which to great Pieces are commonly dead Trucks; so that each Piece may have little or no play.</P>
<P>But in case any thing should give way in foul weather, then with all speed dismount the Piece as soon as possible you can, for fear of further mischief; for which purpose put in his way as he runs from side to side, Rugs, Pillows, Beds, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> and stand ready with Crows and Handspikes, and with Tackles, to hitch or ketch him close and fast to any Ring by the Ship side, or such other place as best presents. As for the length of the Tackles useful, it is usually known thus; see how long the Piece is, and make the Tackles four times as long, and let the Britchin be twice the length of the Piece, and something more. The manner of drawing of Pieces by Man and Horse, you will see in the third Figure.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT remains necessary for this Chapter to treat, or shew the way to know, whether a Piece be serviceable or no, which is usually done in the first proof by Powder, which we intend not to Write of here, having mentioned it before, and more will be said, when we have shewed the composition of Powder. That knowledge of a Piece we here intend, is to examine a Piece, bought, or to be taken into Service, whether good or serviceable, or out of many Pieces to make choice of the best, or such as are freed from holes, flaws, cracks, honycombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And first to know if a Piece be free from crack, or have holes through, take a long stick, longer than the Piece, made of a Hoop-stick or otherwise, slit it at one end, so that you may put a short peece of Candle in it, then light the Candle, and put it into the Piece, and so putting it along easily, whilst another laying his Eye close to the Piece, do go along equally with the Candle, until the whole Piece be viewed, and so by help of the Light within side, the Eye without side will perceive whether there be any Flaws, Cracks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This may be done by the reflection of the Sun beams in at the Muzzle of a Piece, by help of a Looking-glass, or pollished Steel; but many times a Piece may be Flawed or Hony-combed, and cannot be discerned through the Piece, and then the best way to find them out is thus; make the usual search with two or three Springs, or in case you have them not, bend the Iron point of a Half Pike, then put it into the Piece up to the Britch end or bottom of the Cylinder, turning it round carefully and gradually, as you pluck it out, and if there be any Honey-combs, Cracks or Flawes, the end or bended point of the Half Pike wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stick or catch at them.</P>
<P>To know whether the Piece be Chamber-bor'd, take a priming Iron that is small, or a piece of Wire, bend it a little at the end, but so that it may go down at the Touch-hole, and put it down so far as it will go; Then at the Touch-hole close by the Metal of the Piece, make a mark upon the Wire; then gently pluck it up upon one side of the Touch-hole, until the bended point stop upon the Metal or upper side of the Chamber; and then make another mark upon the Wyer, just by the Touch∣hole;
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> then draw out the Wyer, and the distance between these two marks, is the height of the Chamber or bore of the Piece at Britch: take the height of the bore at Muzzle, and if this height at Muzzle agree with that taken at the Britch of the Piece, then is the Piece full bored; but if they differ, so much as the difference is, sheweth the tapering of the Piece, and according to this must your former be made for your Cartredges. There is another way to know whether a Piece be Chamber∣bor'd, or Tapering by the disparting of a Piece; which way we shall shew in its proper place, where we treat of disparting a Piece of Ordnance.</P>
<P>Now although we have mentioned in the former Chapters the most usual Pieces of Ordnance; yet, as I have said, there are other Pieces which are longer, or shorter, which are used, and are generally called by the name of Bastard Pieces, and they are distinguished from the common Legitimate Pieces thus; The Legitimate Pieces have their due length of Chance, and are proportioned according to the true height of their bore. Bastard Pieces are shorter Chases, such as the proportion of their bore doth require, and are therefore called Cuts of the same nature of the Piece they agree with in the bore; as those of Demi-Culverin bore, are called Demi-Culverin Cuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are also Pieces called Extraordinary, which are such whose Chaces are longer than is usually for that bore.</P>
<P>Now we have well and duely understood how, not only to make, but also to exa∣mine and prove a Piece of Ordnance, in the next place shall follow their use, set down in due order: Wherein first 'tis necessary for us to treat of the nature of Gun∣powder, and its various Compositions, with the Materials necessary thereunto, and afterward shew its use.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Materials used in the Composition of Gun∣powder; and first we will treat of the Original of Salt-Peter.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is believed by many in these latter times, that the Salt-Peter now in use, is not the Niter of the Ancients, but a new Invention used or found out for the Com∣position of Powder; And that theirs was only a Niter generated by nature, or that Salt that is coagulated of it self, without any humane Artifice, in the Caverns of the Earth, from whence they took it which nevertheless they divide into four different Species, to wit, <HI>Armenian, Affrican, Roman,</HI> and <HI>Egyptian;</HI> and this <HI>Egyptian</HI> holds its name by a certain Region in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in which is found great abundance. <HI>Serapian</HI> delivers to us, that the places from whence they drew their Niter were all one and the same, like them where common Salt is formed, in which the water running doth congeal, and condenseth like a vulgar Stone, from hence came it to be called stonified Salt, or Sal-Peter. The same Author doth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irm, that Niter was found of divers colours, <HI>viz.</HI> White, Reddish, Livid, or Lead-like, and all other colours it was able to take; he saith likewise that it was found in different forms; for some was found full of holes or caverns like a Spunge; others on the contrary were firm, close, sollid, shining, and Diaphanous as Glass, which being let fall easily will split in thin leaves, and is fryable in beating; and from its various appearances is judged its manifold vertues, in one more powerful than another, which is known by its operation.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<P>From hence we see that which is to be found from the testimony of the best received Authors about the Mineral Niter, and in none is any mention made of Artificial Salt-Peter, or such as we at present make use of generally, which is called properly <HI>Salt-Peter, Sal Nitre,</HI> or <HI>Halinitre;</HI> yet is there very little difference between the Natural that useth to be brought to us, and the Artificial; for if we compare the vertues and operations of the one, we shall find them in our uses no way d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffering, as <HI>Scaliger</HI> testifies, saying that the ancient Niter is not much different from ours, particularly if we consider its tenuity and sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il part.</P>
<P>There is of the ancient Niter found upon the superficies of old Walls, exposed to the humidity; but particularly in Cellars and deep Caves, and in covered Vaults; it resembles perfectly a certain Brine, or white Gelly, or fine Meal, or in more proper speaking, fine Sugar, and is many times white as Snow; and this thus had, the vertues are to be commended, which I my self have taken the pains to collect, in the imitation of many others which I have often seen; which if now it be desired to prepare this Salt according to the method of our Art; It will be congealed into small little long Christals like Isicles, and it will be like that of the Ancients. But as 'tis impossible to find so great a quantity, as the continual use doth consume, and necessity doth excite to this day for the supply of all Wars, which have been great, and in few years consumed many great and vast places of the Universe: We are therefore constrained to this new subject, and are forced even to study and invent in these latter ages a new way to supply the want of the former, which being made with much labour and industry from the bowels of the Earth, and then purified and washed divers times to separate it from its more gross and Terrestrial parts, and taken from its first crudity, that its may shew its likeness of its Mother, it is in the end perfectly purified and brought to such a height, that it differs nothing to he of the same form and vertue of the ancient Salt-Peter.</P>
<P>Wherefore if I may be admitted to speak my thoughts upon it, I shall say openly and plainly, leaving none in doubt, the Ancients did indeed find natural growing Niter, which came out of it self at the tops of Rocks, filling the clefts and holes, and there condensing into small Icicles, it hardnes and petrefies. This Niter is natural; but since Art is the Imitator of Nature, as 'tis allowed by all, then you may not think it strange, if we can by a little of her aid, and by force of industry, attain to the perfection of her productions; nay, (if I may be bold to say it) such as shall surpass by far, the more perfect of her works. Do we not daily see an infinite of very principal Works brought to light, after a long and painful travel, which is not per∣mitted nature to imitate, although she did imploy at the best all her secret and full strength to come to perfection. It may from hence ▪herefore be concluded that our Salt made by the Art of Fire, is such as is every way agreeing with that of the Ancients, not any way differing one from the other; especially as to those uses we intend here. For if according to our method given in the next Chapter, I dare affirm, in all our uses it will truely imitate the natural, but the more, if it be purified and purged many times: So that at last it will come to be more excellent than the An∣cient and natural Salt-Peter; which is plainly seen in the ordinary way of purifying Common Salt or Sugar, which by Art is so purged, that it comes to be far purer and whiter than 'twas before, in its first natural dress. And this we do suppose to be a sufficient argument, or reason, for us to judge that our Artificial Salt-Peter is not only as good, but far more excellent than the natural: Which being thus allowed, we will add only a few words of the properties of Niter, and so pass to its Artificial preparation. And first of the spetting quality and noise it makes in the fire, which <HI>Scaliger</HI> would have to be caused by its terrestrity that it holds in it self, which we cannot allow of, but rather judge otherwise; for if the Earthy part were the subject that made it make such noise, then the Earth it self might be adjudged to make a far greater noise, seeing it is also mixed with this Element, and yet we find it cracks not at all, being put in the fire; therefore by consequence this reason is void. Well then, is it of its rarity, which <HI>Aristotle</HI> calls <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, This cannot pass for a truth, since daily experience doth let us see that the Mushrooms,
<PB N="11" REF="8"/> or Toad-stools, and many other things which are of a most rare thin nature, yet make no noise when put upon burning coals. Neither is the hardness that is joyned to these more subtil parts, the cause of the cracking; For we see that the Pumice-stone will not spet nor crack, nor make any noise in the fire, although it be of a substance sufficiently spungy and hard. There must therefore be another thing that must be the cause of this spetting, and all the noise that is made by Nitre, when it is embraced by the fire. The Divine <HI>Praeceptor,</HI> in the 11 Section of his Questions saith, that the Salt cracks in the fire, because it contains in it much moisture, which being attenuated by the fire, and rarified in a high degree, con∣verts all into Spirits, and an Airy nature; For in it there is contained more of a Spirit, than watery matter, which being brought to the fire, the two fiery Spi∣rits mutually attract each other, and joyning together, do become Master of the lesser part the Water; for the fire of the Niter being fortified and put into action by the common fire, the Water is constrained from its bonds, and can stay no longer there, but must of a suddain depart, and in its way, by the violency of its departure, overthroweth all such obstacles as come in its way: And in this action the external air being strongly and violently agitated, by their refraction, it breaks with impetuosity or great violence, and from thence by consequence follows that hideous and fearful noise which commonly and ordinarily happens, in the com∣bustion of Salt-Peter, and other Compositions mixed with it, whereof Salt-Peter is the greatest part.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The way of Preparing Salt-Peter from a Ni∣trous Earth.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Earth and matter of Salt-Peter is found commonly in great abundance, in obscure shadowed places, where no Rain nor any fresh water doth penitrate, nor likewise where the Sun by his rayes can communicate his heat; it is likewise drawn from Horse dung under Stables, and from covered places where great and small Cattle are shut up; likewise in such places as men use to piss in, or Jaqueses, or the like places; or in places where has been made great Fights, or where has been laid up together many dead Bodies, and earth thrown upon them: For from thence in few years may much Salt-Peter be drawn. I shall declare three several wayes whereby to ground your judgment with more certaint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, concerning the goodness of the place from whence one would draw the Salt-Peter, which is most necessary to be known by all Salt-Peter men, or such as intend to mannage these Affairs.</P>
<P>The first is, that such Earth as you suspect to hold Salt-Peter, be put upon the Tongue, and if it prick a little sharply, it is a most certain sign you will not loose your labour in taking it to task; but on the contrary if it be not biting, or a little corrosive, it will not well answer your money and labour in preparing of it.</P>
<P>The second way to know a good Nitrous Earth is this: make a hole in the Earth with a sharp pointed thing, either of Wood or Iron▪ and in it put a peece of Iron red hot; after having stopt the hole, let it stand until it be quite cold, then draw it out, and if you find a little after about this Iron some Citrine marks, inclining a little after to a whiteness, you need not doubt that earth; but further assure your self 'tis very good to put to work.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<P>The third way is, throw a little of that Earth upon burning Coals, and if you perceive it make any noise, and that it spets in the fire, or that clear and shining sparks come from it, you may from thence judge that that Earth holds a forcible matter of that nature.</P>
<P>After you have found a proper Earth to draw Salt-Peter from, and that by some of these proofs you have testimony of its goodness and worth, let be taken of it a great quantity, or as much as you please; let it be carried to a place appointed for this purpose, then prepare to burn a good quantity of Wood, either of Oak, Ash, Elm, Maple, or other sorts of hard Wood, that you may have Ashes; then take two parts of these Ashes, one part of quick Lime, mix them well, and put this mixture by it self; for such uses as I shall shew you anon.</P>
<P>Take then Vessels of Wood, or Pipes, or Hogsheads cut in two parts, for they must be able to hold a good quantity of Water, make a hole at the bottom about one or two fingers breadth, put into the hole a small wicker thing, or you may whelm over it an Earthen Dish, after put Rushes all over the bottom (not excepting the hole) or in its place clean straw; this Vessel being thus fitted, dispose of it in this manner; Set it so, that under may stand a lesser Vessel of Wood to receive the Li∣quor that shall distil down from the upper Vessel; after put into the upper Vessel about the height of a hand of this Salt-Peter Earth, which has been before for some time dryed in the Air; upon this Earth put the height of three or four fingers of the mixture made of Ashes and quick Lime, and then again of the Salt-Peter Earth, after of the Ashes about the same height as before; and continue this fashion, putting Earth upon Ashes, and Ashes upon Earth, until the Vessel be full within a hands breadth at the top, to hold the Water that is put in; this done put upon it fresh Water as much as shall be necessary, <HI>viz.</HI> so much as must surmount the Earth two or three fingers breadth, and look that it pass through all the Earth, and run drop by drop through the hole at bottom of the Vessel into the Tub standing under, and you shall have a Nitrous <HI>Lixivium,</HI> according to the quantity of Water as you poured into the Vessel; which if you judge is too little, you must reiterate the infusion, and the second time also the water passing through the Earth will carry with it a sub∣stance; And so the third time.</P>
<P>This done, put all the <HI>Lixivium</HI> into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettle of a sufficient bigness, and let it be boyled upon the fire very easily, and moderately at first; after increase the fire to the consumption of the Liquor, or a little more, keeping continually skimming it all the time it boyls. And when 'tis thus consumed, pour it into wooden Vessels that are broad, and cover them over with Cloaths, and let them stand until the pure part Christalize into white Salt, and the feculent or more terrestial part settle to the bottom. In the mean time continue pouring in of the <HI>Lixivium</HI> again into the Kettle, boyling and skimming it as before; and this do until all your <HI>Lixivium</HI> be boyled up and poured into wooden Vessels to Christalize.</P>
<P>Then from the wooden Vessels, inclining them gently, pour all the <HI>Lixivium</HI> (leav∣ing the settling at bottom by it self) into your Copper as before, and boyl it up again with a good fire until half be consumed, or until it begin to thicken, or until by putting a little upon a stone or peece of board, it do immediately congeal.</P>
<P>Then take it from the fire, and when 'tis a little cooled, pour it as before into wooden Vessels or Boles, and put into each about a hand in height; then cover each Vessel with course cloaths, put it into a cool place, and two or three dayes after you will find your Salt-Peter congealed and thrust together in small Christals, like transparent Ice, sticking to the sides of the Vessel, and likewise upon some sticks for that purpose, provided the rinds being taken off and placed in the wooden Vessels be∣fore the pouring in of the Liquor; get diligently together the Peter, as well that which sticks to the sides of the Vessel, as that to the sticks, in a Vessel of wood proper to receive it, and cover it, and keep it dry. The remaining water you must boyl up as before, not forgetting to separate it from its residence.</P>
<P>Whilst 'tis boyling, it happens sometimes that the Liquor may rise and boyl over the Cauldron; to prevent that danger, have in readiness other <HI>Lixivium,</HI> made
<PB N="13" REF="9"/> of three parts of Ashes, and one part of quick Lyme, as we spoke before, in which is dissolved <HI>Roch Allum,</HI> allowing to every hundred weight of <HI>Lixivium,</HI> four pounds of Allum; and when it begins to rise, pour in a little of this from time to time; And by this means you will see that the water that was hastning to come over, will fall down; and that the common Salt and more terrestrial part will settle to the bottom.</P>
<P>The Earth remaining in the Wooden Tubs from whence the salt was drawn, must be put in some cover'd place made for that purpose, where neither Sun, Rain, nor any other water may come; and there it must be spread all abroad about a foot high: Then you must have in readiness Horse dung or the Excrements of all sorts of Beasts, great and small, and put off this upon the other, about the height of three or four foot; then take all that was skum'd from the <HI>Lixivium</HI> in boyling, and the water that is left and will not shoot, and the bottoms that are left in the wooden Vessel, where the Salt-Peter did shoot, and throw them away, as hurtful and useless, upon the Dung∣hil; throw likewise every day, or as often as you can, the Urine of men, and let it lye two years, and you shall have your Earth filled with Salt-Peter as before, with a greater aboundance: You may likewise throw upon your Dunghill, the Horns, Claws, and Hoofs of Beast, and then from this Earth it will be very easie to draw good Salt-Peter by the method we have prescribed.</P>

<P>TAke as much Salt-Peter as you please, and being put in a Copper, pour upon it so much fair water as will dissolve it, that is about eight of Water, and three of Salt; and pour upon the same of the former <HI>Lixivium,</HI> prepared of Ashes, Quick-lyme, and Roch Allum; boyl it upon the fire until all the Salt-Peter be dis∣solved; that being done, have in readiness a Vessel of Wood sufficiently big, and so disposed, that another may stand under the same: which must, before it be so set, be peirced in the middle, and the hole covered over with an Earthen Dish: Let the uppermost Tub be filled five or six inches with fine clean sand; then let the Tub be covered over with a course cloath, and pour through the same into your Sand-Tub your dissolved Salt-Peter, and so it will distil by little and little into the Vessel which stands under; and so passing through the Sand, it will be discharged of all its superfluities, and will leave the most terrestial part, and such as is useless, in the Sand, which water again put into the Cauldron, and boyl it up as formerly, until it may be fit to congeal, and in the end pour it into wooden long flat Vessels as before, and in two or three dayes 'twill be shot into Christals as formerly; which if you would have purer, you must reiterate this work once more, or you may put upon this Peter, Lyme-water, filter it and boyl it up according to Art, and it will be pure.</P>
<P>Salt-Peter may be purified thus; put your Salt-Peter in a Vessel of Copper, Iron, or Vernish't Earth (I like a Crucible best) which being put to a small fire, augment it gradually until all the Salt be melted and boyl'd; then take common Sulphur finely pulverised, and throw it upon the liquified Salt-Peter, which will quickly take fire and burn, and by the same means consume all the gross and viscous humours, with the terrestrial Salt remaining useless amongst the Salt-Peter, before the rectification; besides you may reiterate this work by putting on fresh Sulphur many times, until such time all the strange humours be quite consumed; in the end, the Salt-Peter being
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> well melted and well purified, pour it upon well polished Marble or Plates of Iron, or Copper, or glazed Earth, and let it cool, and you will have a Salt-Peter con∣gealed, almost resembling in colour and hardness the true Alabaster.</P>

<P><HI>How Salt-Peter Meal is made without any beat∣ing, for the making of Gun-powder.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SAlt-Peter well purified, must be put in a Kettle, upon a furnace over a fire, then moderately increase the fire with Bellows to such a degree of heat, until it begin to smoak and evaporate, until the Salt begin to lose its humidity, and obtain a whiteness, and so keep continually stirring it with a wooden or Iron Ladle, for fear it should return into its pristine form, and hereby will be taken away all its fatty greasiness that may be commixt. This being done, pour so much water into the Kettle as will cover the Salt-Peter, and when it shall be dissolved, and it has obtained the consistence of a thick Liquor; then with a wooden stick or Ladle keep continually stirring it without any intermission, until all its humidity be evaporated, and all be reduced into most dry white Meal.</P>

<P>If it make the same noise in burning as the common Salt doth when it is thrown upon live coals, it is a sign it holds yet much common Salt.</P>
<P>If it hold a thick and fat scum, it is a sign 'tis fatty and viscous.</P>
<P>If after the Salt be consumed, there resteth yet crass and filthy matter upon the board, it is an infallible sign that the Salt contains yet a quantity of earthy matter, and so much the more, if you see much dregs after the combustion of the Salt-Peter is past; and therefore the less powerful and active.</P>
<P>But by contraries, if it render a cleer long flame divided into many streams, and that the superficies of the board remain neat without any filth; or that it be consumed so that nothing is left, but a white clean ash, without making much noise, or great trembling, you may then conclude that the Salt-Peter is good, and well cleansed, and in its perfect preparation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How to clarifie common Sulphur, and to know its goodness.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE experience often, and without contradiction, that not only Salt-Peter is filled with terrestrial qualities, but Brimstone also, which is not only of a fat∣ty &amp; certain oleganious humour, but likewise a noysome quality which is in the com∣pound, common to one and the other of its matters; from hence (if we desire to be curious in our work) we judge it may be necessary to purifie Sulphur, and to procure to it by power of clarification, a nature most sublime, subtile, fiery and volatile. The order and method that ought to be used in this, is thus; in Vessels of Iron or Copper, melt your Sulphur with a very gentle fire over Coals, well lighted, and not flaming; and when it is melted with a Ladle, skim neatly off all that riseth on the top and swimmeth upon the Sulphur; then not long after, let it be taken from the fire, and strained through a double Linnen Cloath into another Vessel, pouring it through at leisure; thus all the Oylie matter and crassy substance remains in the Cloath; but under in the Vessel will be a pure Sulphur, such as we have before spoken of.</P>
<P>To know the goodness of Sulphur you must do thus: Press it between two Iron plates, that are hot, and if in the running it appear yellow, without any bad odour, and that which remains be of a reddish colour, one may believe 'tis natural and excellent; so likewise 'tis a good sign, if when 'tis set on fire, it do freely burn all away, leaving little or no resident matter. For if Sulphur be pure and good, we do find that there is such a sympathy between it and fire, that the fire is desirous of the Sulphur for its nutriment, and that reciprocally the Sulphur is pleased like∣wise to be thus devoured and consumed by the Element of fire; so that if some fragment of it be put about some pieces of Wood, if this shall feel the fire at some distance, it seems as if it did attract it to it self, and doth sometimes unawares at a distance catch or take fire, if great care be not taken.</P>
<P>There is a certain kind of Sulphur which will not burn so freely as other Sulphur, nor send forth any ill scent, but being put upon the fire, melts no otherwise than common Wax; and this Sulphur is found abundantly near Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> as <HI>Carniola</HI> of <HI>Libavius</HI> reports, in his first Book of the <HI>Apocap. Hermel.</HI> but this Sul∣phur is commonly red, as also is that which is found in the <HI>Heil des Heim</HI> (as <HI>Agricola</HI> mentions in his first Book, <HI>Chap.</HI> 22.) And upon the testimony of <HI>Iohn Iohn∣son, Adm. Nat. Clas. 4. Chap.</HI> 13. Sulphur is found likewise of divers other colours, as pale, Yellow, Green, as is many times to be seen and found sticking about Stones and Rocks: So, that a man may, without any great difficulty, take it from thence, and make it into a Mass.</P>
<P>That which is clear, perfectly yellow, not very hard, nor too much shining, is the very best. Yet there is another Sulphur which looks greenish, and hath never past the fire; and this is called <HI>Sulphur Vivum,</HI> and by some <HI>Virgin Sulphur,</HI> by reason Women and Maids had a custom to compose with it a certain <HI>fucus</HI> or Paint, with which they used to adorn their faces.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Month of <HI>May</HI> or <HI>Iune,</HI> when all sorts of Trees are easie to peel, by reason in that time there comes out a sap, and they are fuller of humours than at any other time of the year, Cut then a great quantity of Hazle or Ash, the length of two or three foot, of the bigness of half your fist, taking away from them with a Bill all that is Superfluous, then take away the rind likewise; and of these make little bundles, and make them very dry in a warm Oven; then in a place chosen for that purpose, that is plain and even, set them upright one by another, and set them on fire; and after you see the fire well lighted, and that the fire hath reduced them all into burning Coals, cover them closely and diligently with wa∣tered earth, so that it may have no respiration, or that no Air may pass in; then, the flame being thus stifled upon the Coals, they will remain pure and whole, with∣out being charged with much Ashes; then 24 hours after, you may take them away and keep them for to serve you in your business, and put them to such uses as we shall write of hereafter.</P>
<P>But if you have occasion for a small quantity only, take then of the Arms and Limbs of such Trees aforesaid, that is of Teil wood, of Juniper, of Ash, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Cut them in small pieces, and dry them well; then shut them in an Earthen Vessel, and lute the Cover on the top with Clay; then place Coals round about the Pot, and let it be all covered with Coals, leaving them so the space of a good hour, continu∣ing the fire all this while in the same degree of heat; at last let it cool of it self, and when 'tis cold, open the pot, and take out the Coals for your use.</P>

<P><HI>The wayes of Compounding or Making Gun∣powder.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe wayes of Compounding of Gun-Powder have been so commonly known, that not only such as are conversant in fireworks do understand the same, but others also; so that it is made a particular Trade: nay, that which is more strange, the Countrey people in <HI>Polonia</HI> have learned to prepare it with their own hands, without the use of any Artificial Engine, or Chymical Vessel. For I have seen many of the People of <HI>Podolie,</HI> and <HI>Ʋkrains,</HI> which we call now the <HI>Cossaques,</HI> who pre∣pare their Powder quite contrary to the common way, or that which is used by Fire-Masters. For they put Sulphur, Salt-Peter, Charcoal, all together in an Earthen Pot, a certain proportion of each; (which proportion one to the other they have learned by experimental practice) upon which they pour fair fresh water, which they boyl upon the fire until all the water is evaporated, and the matter become thick; then
<PB N="18" REF="12"/> they take it from the fire, and dry it in the Sun, or in some warm place, as a Stove, or the like; then they pass it through a Hair Sieve, and reduce it into small Grains. There are others that take these Materials, and grind them upon a smooth flat Stone, or a smooth Earthen Dish, and then having moistned it, by their Skill they bring it into Grains; which powder brought to this degree of perfection, they serve their occasions with as much utillity and profit, as if it had been made by the hand of one of the most knowing or skilful Powder-makers in the world.</P>
<P>It is in my judgment, labour lost to speak more of these superficial wayes; but come to the order and method which is necessary and usually observed in the preparing of Gun-Powder: It shall likewise suffice me to propose in this Chapter some Com∣positions most excellent and best approved; which are these,</P>

<P>You must first finely powder these compositions or mixtures, for Cannon or Musquet Powder, and after moissen them with fair fresh water or Vinegar, or with <HI>Aquavitae;</HI> but if you will have your Pistol Powder stronger and more violent, you ought to stir it up several times whilst tis in the Morter, with this following liquor; that is, a water distilled from Rinds of Oranges, Citrons, or Lemons, by an Alymbeck, or any other Chymical Vessel; then let all be beaten and well brayed 24. hours, and then in the end reduce it into very fine small grains.</P>
<P>A Liquor for this purpose may likewise be made of twenty parts of <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and 12 parts of distilled Vinegar made of Whitewine, and four parts of Spirit of Salt-Peter, and two parts of water of Sal-armoniac, and one part of Camphire dis∣solved in Brandy-wine, or reduced into Powder with powdered Sulphur, or redu∣ced with Oyl of sweet Almonds.</P>
<P>To Corn Powder well, you must prepare a Sieve with a bottom of thick Parchment, made full of round holes; then moisten the Powder that must be corned with its water, and make it up in Balls as big as Eggs; which put into the Sieve, and with it put a wooden Bowls, and when you have so done, sift the Powder so, as the Bowl rouling about the Sieve, may break the Clods of Powder, and make it pass through those little holes into Corns.</P>
<P>It is observed by Fire-Masters and Gunners, that Powder when it is Corned, is of much greater force and power, than in Meal; from hence 'tis concluded, that powder when 'tis put into a Piece of Ordnance, ought not to be pressed or beaten home too hard in the Piece; for thereby it will loose its form of grains, and thereby looseth a great part of its strength that it had, and is therefore not able to throw out the Bullet with so great a violence, as if the Powder had been gently thrust home to the Britchend.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>KNow first that all the blackness which you see in Gun-powder comes from the Coal; not that this colour is absolutely necessary to be conjoyned to its nature, or that it is absolutely necessary to be given to it, for its meliorating or making it more vigorous; this is not so; but by contraryes you may be permitted to give unto it any such colours as you shall think fit, without prejudice or hinderance of the Pow∣der and vertue of it. For if instead of Coal you take rotten dryed wood, or Sawdust well dryed, or white paper moistned and dryed in a Stove and powdered, or indeed any other thing of a combustible nature, or that is well disposed to take fire (such as you read hereunder) and to this you may add a colour according to your fancie and pleasure; and you will infallibly have a Powder that will make the same Effect as the black powder.

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Proof or Tryal of Gun-powder.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is accustomary for men skilled in these Arts, to try Powder three several wayes; that is, by sight, by touch, and by fire: And first, for the tryal by sight; it is thus,</P>
<P>If the Powder be too black, it is a manifest sign of too much humidity, or too much coal; now if it contain too much, as you suppose, rub it upon white Paper; if it black the Paper more than other good Powder use to do, it is a sign there is more coal in it than ought: for such Gun-Powder as is of a fair azure colour, or a little obscure, somthing bordering upon red, is the best sign, and the most assured testimony of good Powder.</P>
<P>Secondly, Gun-Powder its goodness is known by the touch, in this manner, crush some Corns under your fingers ends, and if they easily break and return to Meal with∣out resisting the touch, or without feeling hard, you may assure your self from thence, that your Powder hath in it too much Coal.</P>
<P>If by pressing it a little hard under your fingers upon a smooth hard board, or upon a stone, you feel amongst it small grains harder or more sollid than the rest, which do in a manner prick the ends of the fingers, and do not yield to the finger but very difficultly, or hardly, you may infer from hence that the Sulphur is not well incorporated with the Salt-Peter, and by consequence the Powder is not well and duely prepared.</P>
<P>You may draw infallible proofs or conjectures of the goodness of Powder by its burning, if after you have made little heaps of Powder upon a clean and even Table, distant one from another about a hands breadth, you then put fire to one of them only; and if it take fire alone, and burn all away without lighting the others, and make a small thundring noise, or make a white clear smoak, and that it rise with a quickness, suddainly, almost imperceptible, and if it rise in the Air like a circle of smoak, or like a small Crown; this is an infallible sign the Powder is good, and perfectly well prepared.</P>
<P>If after the burning of the Powder there remain some black marks upon the Table, this then signifies that the Powder contains too much Coal, which has not been enough burnt.</P>
<P>If the board looks greasie, then the Sulphur and Salt-Peter is not enough cleansed, and by consequence it retains much of their terrestrial matter and oyly natures which were naturally conjoyned to their matters. If you find small grains, white and Citrine, it is a testimony that the Salt-Peter is not enough cleansed, and by consequence it
<PB N="22" REF="14"/> retains much of its terrestrial matter, and of common Salt, and besides, the Sulphur hath not been well powdered, nor sufficiently incorporated with the two other matters of its Composition.</P>
<P>If two or three Corns of Gun-Powder be laid upon a Paper, distant about a fin∣gers bredth one from the other, and you put fire to them, if the fire be good and strong, they will fire at once, and there will remain no grossness of Brimstone, or of Salt-Peter, nor any thing but a white smoaky colour in the place where they were burnt, nor will the Paper be touched. If small black knots, which will burn downward in the place where proof is made, remain after firing, they do shew that the Gun-powder hath no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough of Peter, and that it is of little force or strength.</P>
<P>Good Gun-Powder will not burn your hand, if it be set on fire there.</P>
<P>Gun-Powder that is very sharp or eager in tast, is not well purified, and will turn moist.</P>
<P>Amongst many sorts of Powder, to know the best, make a little heap of every sort at a distance one from another; observing well when you fire each heap, which of them doth soonest take fire, for that which soonest takes fire, smoaks least and clearest, and riseth quickly up close and round, and leaves little or no sign behind it, is the best Powder.</P>
<P>There are Instruments likewise invented for the tryal or proof of Powder, which the most part of Fire-Masters and Gunners are accus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omed to use, which are described at large by other Authors; therefore we shall not here repeat the same; con∣sidering likewise, that we have found by experience a great fallacy in the same, for that one and the same Powder, in the same measure and quantities, hath raised the cover to different degrees of height.</P>

<P><HI>To forti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> weak Powder, and amend that which is spoiled, and bring it to its full strength again▪ and to preserve good Powder from decaying.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>VVE call such Gun-Powder weak, which hath much degenerated from its fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t strength, and the force which it did acquire in its first preparation; as such as hath dak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n wind, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or air; for these do diminish the quantity of Salt-Peter, and actually separate the Sulphur and Coal.</P>
<P>There are two different wayes that these accidents do happen; that is, by being many years made, or lying in a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st place long; for in time the Salt-Peter alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and separates it self, being naturally subject to alter, and return into its first matter; for Salt-Peter in its beginning or original being engendered of water, or of a certain Saline bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>our, no otherwise than other Salts are produced of their own proper Brines, doth at last, or in a long time, separate it self from the Coal and Sulphur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and so return to a Brine water again, as it was in the original, and so aban∣do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two matters that adhered to it▪ the Sulphur and Coals loosing no∣thing of their weight, seeing that no humidity that is attracted, can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e able to dissolve them▪ b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her by the contrary, the Coal doth attract greed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, and becomes more ponderous.</P>
<P>If for the reasons afore said you desire to repair and restore the strength of Gun-Powder that begins to alter, or that hath quite lost its force, its defects may be amended three several wayes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> viz.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
<P>The first is thus, make a Lye of two parts of <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and one part of clarified Salt-Peter made into fine Powder, of good Vinegar made of good Wine half a part, of Oyl of Sulphur one eighth part, and as much Camphire dissolved in Brandy; these put together, do make a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> which must be strained through a large Strainer, and then with it you may amend your powder that is decayed, by moist∣ning it with the same, very often, and drying it by the Sun in Wooden Vessels, and then putting it up in a dry place, free from any humidity or air, and then it will not in a long time again be damnified.</P>
<P>The second way to repair Powder is thus, examine how much your Powder weighed when it was first put into the Cask or Barrel, then see how much it doth now weigh after 'tis damnified (it being first dryed if it chance to be wet) then see the difference between these two weights, and add so much Salt-Peter to your decayed powder, mix it well, and make it up into Corns again, and preserve it as before.</P>
<P>The third way to restore the strength of Gun-Powder, is such as is most plain and commonly used amongst the Powder-men; they put upon a Sale-cloath or smooth place or board, a portion of damnified Powder, to which they add an equal weight of that which is new made, and then with their hand or wooden Shovel they mingle it well together; then they dry it in the Sun, and put it up into a Barrel again, and keep it in a dry and proper place.</P>
<P>Yet there is another way may be allowed, but this is almost the same with making new Powder, and it is thus; Take what quantity of decayed Powder you please, put it into Earthen or Wooden Vessels, pour upon the same three times so much hot water, stir it well about, and when it begins to be cold, or hath stood one hour or two, strain the water away, and to the feces put more water, stirring it well about, then let it stand and settle as before, and strain it from the feces, this do a third time, and you will have drawn out all the Salt-Peter; put these waters in a clean Kettle, and boyl it away until so much be consumed, as that a drop dropped upon a Stone or Iron do congeal, then pour it into some wooden Vessel that it may congeal into Salt-Peter; and that water as remains, you must boyl up again as before; and if need be, you must in the boyling skum what riseth on the top of the water. Having by this Art obtained the Salt-Peter out of the decayed Gun-Powder, you may according to the proportions given in the Composition of Powder, mix it with its remaining Sul∣phur and Coal, or fresh Sulphur and Coal, which is better; and after 'tis well mixed, Corn it according to the given Rules; then let it be well d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed, and put up into dry Powder Barrels, and let it be conse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved in a dry place from Air or any Moisture.</P>
<P>Some do mend their Powder in this nature, they moisten it with Vinegar or fair water, beat it fine, and sift it and dry it, and to every pound of Powder they put one Ounce of Mealed Salt-Peter; then moisten and mix them well, so that neither may be discerned one from the other, but that they be perfectly incorporated, which you may know by cutting the Mass with a Knife, or breaking it: When it is well compounded, let it be Corned in manner as we have before prescribed.</P>
<P>If your Composition of Powder be made up with <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and so made up into great Balls, and well dryed in a Stove, or in the Sun, and put into glazed earthen Pots, and close covered, you may keep it as long as you please, for age will not decay it.</P>
<P>There ought alwayes a care to be taken by Gunners or Fire-Masters, or such as have the charge of Gun-powder, to chuse if they can such places as are dry, and stand upon the best ground, free from dampness of the Air or any water possibly coming near. Every Gunner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ought to take care that his Barrel be turned upside down, or any Carthredge ready filled; for if the Powder attract air, the Peter with the moisture it hath attracted, will in time seperate from the other matters, and sink to the bottom; so that the Powder in the upper part will loose its strength, which is prevented by turning and shaking them every fourteen dayes, and airing them at the Sun at convenient times. And as 'tis necessary a Gunner should have Carthredges filled for present Service, those ought also to be turned out and filled again every four∣teen dayes more or less, as the Gunner in his judgment shall allow of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the property and particular office of every Ma∣terial in the Composition of Gun-powder.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE ought infallibly to believe that Gun-Powder was not found out casually, or by fortune; but invented by a true knowledge, and by reasonable spe∣culation in Natural Philosophy; considering that to this day no man hath opposed (notwithstanding many persons have made it their endeavour) or could find any other Materials like unto these, or of such a nature, which being well united and in∣corporated together, they are able to produce a fire so vigorous, fearful, powerful, and above all, so inextinguishable that the whole Universal matter is consumed in a moment; which is the more to be believed, since we make not much difficulty, particularly in this our Age wherein we live, to add many things to the invention of others, and that (as the Physitians say) all that had a beginning doth pass from imperfection to perfection. We desire therefore it may be permitted (since the Inventors have left us nothing in Writing) to propose here some Observa∣tions of Speculative truths, drawn from Experiment, which have been made about the strength, nature, effects, and Office of all the matters comprehended in the Composition of Gun-Powder, as well of the particulars, as all made up into one body. For I believe, that having insinuated into a perfect knowledge of the pro∣perties, and the affections, as well specificated as general, of all its Ingredients, no body more will fall into those Errors which are too often committed in the Art of <HI>Pyrotechny.</HI></P>
<P>We must therefore know, that Gun-powder was not without reason composed of these three materials, to wit, Salt-Pete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Sulphur, and Coal, but to the end that one might remedy or supply the defaults of the others. And this is it which is easie to be comprehended in the effect of Sulphur; for this is naturally the very aliment of the fire, seeing it joyns with it so willingly and freely, and having once taken fire, is most difficult to put out, being no otherwise rightly than a flaming fire, or, to ex∣press it better, a pure flame; and therefore hath an aptitude to enflame the Salt-Peter, by its activity, more than any other kind of fire. But as the Salt-Peter lighted doth go promptly into certain windy exhalations, it hath thereby such a strength in it, that it would by its ventosity put out the flame which the Sulphur hath concei∣ved, and by consequence deny it self of that which the Sulphur communicateth to it; hereby you may see, if one had made a simple composition of these two things only, that is, of Sulphur and Salt-Peter compounded well together, if fire were then applyed, they would in truth be suddenly enflamed, but they would soon after go out, that is, the fire will not continue to the Conflagration and Consumption of the whole mat∣ter, the reason whereof we have given a little before. It was therefore by good rea∣son adjudged, that Coal well dryed and powdered, being adjoyned to these two ma∣terials in a certain proportion, was an excellent remedy for the supplying of this de∣fect, seeing that Coal is of such a property and of such a nature, that if it be held to the fire, it will soon light and be reduced to a fire without any flame; And from hence it comes to pass, that the more it is agitated by the Air, or by wind, the more the fire augments, and will not go out, but conserve it self until the matter that nouri∣sheth it is totally consumed; a little ashes only excepted. From hence it was conclu∣ded that a Composition made of these three Ingredients, such as is our Gunpowder, will conceive fire, and will be conserved, enflamed and consumed unto the last Atome. For it is most certain, that if we approach fire with it, the Sulphur which the fire extreamly loves is soon taken with it, and holdeth the same and introduceth it, not
<PB N="25" REF="15"/> only into the Salt-Peter, but the coal also at the same moment, without producing any flame. Now this fire (as we have said before) cannot be suffocated by wind, but on the contrary is enflamed the more, and takes new strength by the agitation of the Air. And as this Sulphur is a great neighbour of the fire either with or without flame, so it cannot hinder it from taking fire; and 'tis the flame of the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imstone imbraces the Salt-Peter, and the Coal continues it. And by consequence these three materials joyned together, and well incorporated, and then lighted, produceth a fire, until all its aliment and substance be universally consumed and annihilated: Yet there must care be taken that none of these substances have any accidental defaults, either in humidity or disproportion, either more or less. We will conclude then all that we have said, that the true office of Sulphur in the Powder is to conceive the flame or re∣ceive the fire, and having received it, to communicate it to the other matters; and that the Coal hath a particular care to retain and consume it▪ and to hinder the fire (after it is once introduced by the Sulphur) from suffocating or going out by any windy Exhalation and great violence caused by the Salt-Peter; and lastly, that the most notable and particular office of the Salt-Peter is to produce and cause a most vehement and powerful ventosity or windy Exhalation. And in this which I have said, lieth all the truth of the strength, power and expulsive motion and activity of the Gun-powder; and by consequence Salt-Peter alone is the first and principal cause of all the admirable and astonishing Effects produced by Gunpowder; and conseqnent∣ly, the two other materials are alliated with the Salt-Peter for no other end than to make it break forth into fire and wind. For proof of this, if any one will make a Composition of Sulphur and Coal only, and with it charge a Piece of Ordnance, he will find that this will not move or thrust out a Shot of Iron or any other metal; the reason of this weakness is easie to be understood by our foregoing discourse, because the violent expulsion depends absolutely in the Salt-Peter, and in this only expulsive faculty, and not in any of the other matters. Yea I believe that one may prepare Gun∣powder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout Brimstone or Coal, rather than without Salt-Peter; or that a man may without much difficulty prepare other matters, that the one may do the office of Sulphur in kindling the matter, and the other that of Coal in Conserving it and keeping it without flame. But any other thing that hath such hidden natural properties to cause such a ventous Exhalation, so violent and capable to produce such prodigious Effects, as Salt-Peter, may not be produced.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FIrst there must be made Cords of coarse hemp, or rather of Tow, about the big∣ness of half your thumb, or a good finger in Diameter; then take the ashes of Oak, Ash, Elm, or Maple, three parts, of quick Lyme one part, and make thereof a Lye after the usual manner; which being done, add to it of the Liquor drawn from Horse dung neatly strained and leasurely exprimed through a strainer, or linnen Cloath, two parts, of Salt-Peter one part, and being all well mix'd, put into a Cop∣per your Match Cords, and pour upon them your <HI>Lixivium,</HI> and make a small fire under the same, augmenting it gradually, until it be great, which you must keep
<PB N="26" REF="16"/> boyling two or three dayes continually; not boyling it dry, as some of our Writers prescribe, but supplying it continually with fresh <HI>Lixivium,</HI> for fear both Match and Kettle burn for want of Liquor; in the end having taken out the fire, take the Cords out of the Liquor, and wring them hard in your hands, rubbing off the moisture from them with a peece of Cloath, that comes forth in the wringing; then hang them in the Air or Sun upon long Poles to dry, and when they are well dryed, make them up in bundles, and carry them into a commodious place to keep for use.</P>
<P>But to make Match that will never have bad scent nor smoak, you must get a cer∣tain quantity of red Sand, or Gravel well washed, and purged from all its filth; put it into an Earthen pot that is not varnished, then put into the pot upon the Sand, your common Match, or any other made of Cotton, or the like matter, and coyle it in such manner, that there be half a fingers breadth of interval between every coyl of the Match, to the end they may not touch each other, but that the Match in its turning or Coyles have its sides equally distant one from the other; then throw again upon that a good quantity of Sand▪ and coyl in the Cord again as be∣fore: Continue thus your work until your pot be full, then cover the pot with a co∣ver of the same earth, and close well the joynts with Lute made of fat Earth that no Air may enter; This being well and surely done, put lighted coals round about the pot, and let it stand in this posture some time, then take it away and let it stand un∣til it be quite cold before you open it; When 'tis perfectly cold, take off the Co∣ver, pour out the Sand, and draw out the match, for 'tis prepared, and will burn as we have said.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>VVE have already in the Second Chapter of this Book shewn the way of mol∣ding and casting peices of Ordnance; if well understood, you cannot be ig∣norant in the way of Casting Shot. Therefore to avoyd any thing that might be tedious or unnecessary to the Students of this art, we will come to the most ne∣cessary things concerning Shot, that is, such as every Gunner ought to know. But be∣cause most of the propositions depend upon the knowledg of the Square and Cube Roots, which many (though otherwise knowing in most common Arithmetick) do not understand, I thought it good therefore to shew the Extraction of the Square and Cube Roots after a very easie way; with the necessary propositions in Gunnery, thereunto belonging.</P>

<P>Set down any number of figures as you shall think good, as, 2735716, then be∣gin at your first right hand figure that is at 6, and make a prick under it, and so along every other figure as you may see here already done; and seeing the first prick to the left hand falls to be under 2, therefore seek in the Table above in the ranck of
<PB N="27" REF="16"/> Squares for this number 2, or the nearest <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></NOTE> number less, which here we find to be 1, and over it we find the Root to be 1, which must be placed in the quotient, and likewise un∣der the first prick to the left hand, then having 1 for a Divisor, and 1 for the quotient, say but the common Rule of Division, 1 times 1 is one, 1 from 2 and there remains 1; which sent over the 2, then double the quotient and it makes 2, which place between the two first pricks to the left hand that is under 7; then say how many times 2 in 17, (here you must be very cautious not to take too many) which here may be six times, place the 6 in the quotient as before, and under the second prick that is under 3, and divide as before, then double the quotient which is now 16 and it makes 32, place the 2 between the second and third prick, <HI>viz.</HI> under 5, and the 3 before it under the 6, so the 32 will stand under the 175 which is above; then say how many times 3 in 17, which you will find to be 5, place it in the quotient and under the third prick, and divide as before, always setting the Remainder over the head of its proper fi∣gures; then double the quotient again, which is now 165 and it makes 330, place the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> between the two pricks as before, and place the figures before it to the left hand, as you see above, and the first figure to the left will be 3 which stands under 13; then say how many times 3 in 13, which will be 4, which place in the quotient, and under the fourth or last prick, and divide as before; so you will fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no Remain∣der, which assures the number given to be a square number. The proof of these is known by multiplying the square Root found in it self (taking in the remains if any be) and it must produce that given number, otherwise it is false.

<P>Begin at your right hand, (as you did in Extracting the Square Root) and set pricks under every fourth figure, that is, leave two figures unprickt, or between the pricks, and so proceed to the left, until you have done as here you see, 7 5 6 7 8 7 3 2 (the number of pricks shew the number of figures that will be in the quotient.</P>
<P>Then see by the Table before in this Chapter the nearest Cube to the numbers stan∣ding over the first prick to the right hand, which is 75, I search in the Table of Cubes and find the nearest number to it in the Table of Cubes to be 64, and its Root 4, which must be set down in the quotient, and likewise its Cube 64▪ under the prick; and if that number doth not amount to so much as the number standing over the prick, then substract it from the same, and set the Remainder over head.</P>
<P>Then triple the qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tient, and that triple you must set under the next number to the right hand, before that prick where you did last end.</P>

<P>Then (as in common Division) must you look how many times the Divisor in the figures is standing over them, and place that in the quotient.</P>

<P>Then multiply the last figure in the quotient by it self, and then in the triple, and set that figure under the former, one figure more to the right hand.</P>

<HEAD>QUEST. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>By knowing the Diameter and Weight of any one Shot, to find the Weight of another Shot, being both of one and the same Metal.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Shot whose weight we know not, we must have in Diameter likewise, which is found thus, Gird the Shot with a Line, then divide that into twenty two e∣qual parts, and seven of those is the Diameter or the height of the Shot.</P>
<P>But if you have a pair of Callapars by you, the best way is to take the Diameter with them. The fashion and form of taking the Diameter of a Shot, is as here you see in the figure following. <FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>If an Iron Shot of 4 Inches Diameter weigh 9 <HI>l.</HI> what shall a Shot weigh whose Diameter is twice as much, that is, 8 In∣ches.</P>
<P>Cube each Diameter, then multiply the Cube of the Shot whose weight is required by the Diameter of the given Shot, and that Sum divided by the Cube of the known Diameter, the quotient is the Diameter of the Shot required.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>This question may also be performed by the former Table of Cubes, if you search in the Collum of Roots until you find your Diameters in a right Line with the same
<PB N="37" REF="21"/> under the word Cube, you will find the Cube answerable to the number given, thus; you will find the Cube of 4 to be 64, and of 8 to be 512, and this 512 multiplyed by the weight of the known Bullet, <HI>viz. 9 l.</HI> it makes 4608, which divided by 64, gives the weight of the Bullet to be 72 <HI>l.</HI> which was to be known.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>QUEST. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Knowing the Diameter and weight of one Shot, to find the Diameter of a Shot that weigheth twice as much.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Suppose the known Shot was 4 Inches Diameter, and weigh 9 pound, and it were required to find the Diameter of a Shot, whose weight is twice as much, that is 18, find the Cube-Root of each Shots weight, then multiply the Diameter of the Shot whose weight is known, by the Cube of the Diameter of the Shot whose weight is required; and that Sum divided by the Cube of the Diameter of the known Shot and the quotient is the Diameter required. Example. By the former Rule, or by the Ta∣ble, the Cube of the pounds will be found to be 2, 08, and the Cube of 18 will be 2, 62, now multiply this last number by 4, and it makes 9, 48, which divided by 2, 08 will give in the quotient 5, 03 for the Diameter required.</P>
<P>This question may very easily be wrought by the Line of numbers, thus; divide the distance between 9 and 18 into three equal parts, and that extent will reach from 4 In∣ches to 5, 03 Inches, the Diameter required.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>QUEST. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How the former question may be Resolved Geometrically.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Make a Square of the Diameter of the lesser Bullet, then draw a Line from Corner to Corner, and this Line thus drawn shall be the Diameter of a Shot twice the weight of the other; which if you divide into two equal parts, setting one foot of your compasses in the middle, you may draw a Circle, and that circumference will represent unto you a Bullet twice the weight of the lesser Diameter.</P>
<P>This work may be proved Arithmetically thus; the Diameter of the lesser Bullet is 4 Inches, the Square thereof 16, which being doubled is 32; and the square Root of this 32 is 5, 65, and so much is the Diameter of the greater Bullet, which weighed 18 <HI>l.</HI> There ariseth here a difference between this way and the former, but this way is the most true; not but that both Rules are true in themselves, but the former de∣pending upon finding the Cube Roots, which cannot be found much more exacter than what I have done, and so working by them, and they not being exact, causes the difference in the work.</P>

<P>Find the Cube of 64 in the Table, and it will be found to be 4; which multiply by 6, and it makes 24; which divided by 3, the Cube of 27, and it gives 8 Inches for the Diameter of the Shot or Bullet which was required.</P>

<HEAD>QUEST. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How this Question may Geometrically be resolved.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV5 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Mr. <HI>Gunter</HI> in his first Book, Section 4. hath shewed how to make a Line of Solids on his Sector; but this Rule shews us the proportion of the Diameters in Weight, ha∣ving a Shot of one pound, two pounds, three pounds weight of Metal, or stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For if the given Shot be one pound, divide the diameter of that Shot into 4 equal parts, and 5 such parts will make a Diameter of a Shot of the said Metal, as is proposed, that shall weigh just twice as much. And divide the Diameter of a Shot that weighs just two pounds into seven equal parts, and eight such parts will make the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds weight. And Divide the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds, into 10 equal parts, and 11 of such parts will give a Shot of 4 pounds weight. And di∣vide a Shot of 4 pounds weight into 13 parts, and 14 such parts will make a Shot of 5 pounds in weight. And divide the Diameter of a Shot of 5 pounds weight, into 16 equal parts, and 17 such parts will make a Diameter of a shot that will weigh 6 pounds. And so dividing the Diameter of a shot 6 pounds weight into 19 equal parts, and 20 such parts will make a Diameter of a shot that will weigh 7 pounds. Thus dividing each next Diameter into three equal parts more than the next less Diameter was divided into, and with one part added to the Diameter of a shot it will weigh just one pound more, and so may proceed infinitely.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>A second way to Perform this work.</HEAD>
<P>Find exactly the Diameter of a shot whose weight is just one pound, then describe a Circle whose Diameter shall be equal thereunto, and divide it into four equal parts, as <HI>a b c d,</HI> and draw the two Diameters <HI>a c</HI> and <HI>d b</HI> crossing the Center, and then take the distance <HI>d c</HI> in your Compasses, and lay it off from <HI>e</HI> to 2, and this will be a shot of two pounds weight.</P>
<P>Then take the distance <HI>d</HI> 2, in your Compasses, and set it off from <HI>e</HI> to 3, so will that distance be the Diameter of a shot of three pounds weight; and so you may proceed in the same manner at your pleasure; as you may see by the projection.</P>
<P>Likewise having the Diameter of a Shot of any weight, the double of the Diameter is the Diameter of a Shot that weighs eight times as much. So that if a Shot of four Inches Diameter weigh nine pounds, a Shot of eight inches Diameter will weigh seventy two pounds; as you may see by this following Table of the weights of Shot. <FIGURE>

<HEAD>QUEST. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>If a Shot of three Inches and a half weigh sir pounds, what will a Shot of seven inches and three quarters weigh.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>You may for 3½ put 3, 50. and for 7¾ put 7, 75. then you may Cube them the common way; then multiply the second by the third number, and divide by the first, the Quotient gives the content.</P>
<P>You may more easily work it by the Table of Cubes aforegoing; that is, against the Root 3, 50. you will find its Cube to be 42, 875; and against the Root 7, 75. you will find its Cube to be 46, 548. and this multiplyed by 6, and divided by 42, 875, will leave 65, 14. that is 65 pounds and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parts of a pound. In this nature may any Fractions be wrought, even as easie as whole Numbers, especially if you reckon your Fractions the Decimal way, or bring them into Decimal Fractions by Re∣duction.</P>

<HEAD>QUEST. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Proportions between Bullets of Iron and Bullets of Lead or Stone, that is, by knowing the Weight of an Iron Shot, to find the Weight of a Shot of the same Diameter made of Lead or Stone.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The Proportion between Lead and Iron is as 3 to 2, so that a Shot of two pound of Iron is the same Diameter as a Shot of 3 pounds of Lead.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> If a Shot of Iron of 3½ Inches Diameter weigh 6 pounds, what will a Shot of Lead of the same Diameter?</P>
<P>For 3½ Inches put 3, 5, and say, if 2 give 3, 5, what will 3 give? <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>This 52½ pounds is the weight of a Shot of Lead of 3 Inches and a half Diameter.</P>
<P>The proportion between Iron and Stone is as 3 to 8, so that a Shot of 12 pound of stone is as big, or the same in Diameter, as the like Shot of Iron that weighs 32 pounds; but some say the proportion between Marble and Iron is as 15 to 34.</P>
<P>A Bullet of Lead to the like of Marble is in proportion as 4 to 1.</P>
<P>The proportion between Lead and Brass is as 24 is to 19.</P>
<P>The proportion between Iron and Lead, as some say, is as 19 to 28.</P>
<P>The proportion between Iron and Brass is as 16 to 18.</P>
<P>By these Rules we may Calculate a Table very easily, to know if an Iron Shot be wanting, and a Shot of any of the other metals to be had, what height and weight either Shot of Lead Brass or Stone ought to be, to fit any piece of Ordnance; and by the same method we have here Calculated a Table, which doth shew the weight of any Shot of Iron, Lead or Stone; from 2 Inches to 9 Inches.</P>
<P>This is worthy to be observed, that you ought not to have so much Powder to Load a Piece that must discharge a Marble Shot, as an Iron Shot; but the proportion must be abated as the proportions between Stone and Iron doth allow of.</P>

<P><HI>By knowing the weight of any one Piece of Ordnance, to find the weight of any other Piece of Ordnance, although dif∣fering in shape or form, knowing the Diameters at Britch, Muzzles, and length of the Pieces.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>By the Rules given in the ninth Proposition, find the sollid Content of the Piece whose weight you know, supposing it to be a sollid body without a Chamber.</P>
<P>Then take the sollid Content of the Concave part, by Rules given in the seventh Proposition, if it be a Cylinder; or by the ninth Proposition, if it be Tapering.

<P>It is always necessary to take care in time of Service of over-loading a Piece, which Error many run into, only minding the bore of a Piece, and not minding whether the Metal will bear it, and so endanger themselves and other standers by. To avoid such errors observe these experienced Rules.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="26"/>
<P>To a <HI>Demy-Cannon</HI> fortified of Brass about 4400, or a little more, there is allowed by the Tower 5 ounces and a half of Powder to every hundred weight of Metal; yet in time of Service Gunners do allow but 3 ounces ¾ to every hundred weight of Me∣tal, which doth amount to 10 <HI>l.</HI> ¼.</P>
<P><HI>Demy-Cannon Drake</HI> of Iron about 3800 <HI>l.</HI> is allowed by the Tower 3 ounces and a half of Powder to every hundred weight of Metal, which will be durable in time of Service; but there are Drakes of 4400 <HI>l.</HI> which must be allowed more, according to the proportion of their weight.</P>
<P><HI>Culverin</HI> fortified Brass of 4600 <HI>l.</HI> is allowed by the Tower 3 ounces and a half of powder compleat to every hundred weight of Metal, which may be burnt in time of Service with very little abatement.</P>
<P><HI>Culverin Drakes</HI> of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> or thereabouts of Iron, for these Pieces may be allow∣ed in time of Service 3 ounces to every hundred weight of metal, but proportiona∣bly must be allowed for Pieces of greater or lesser weight.</P>
<P>The 12 Pounders fortified of Brass of 3200 <HI>l.</HI> for Guns of this weight and nature is usually allowed 3 ounces and a half for every hundred weight of Metal.</P>
<P><HI>Demy-Culverin</HI> Brass of 3300 <HI>l.</HI> there is allowed by the Tower for Pieces of Ord∣nance of this nature 3 ounces and a half and somthing more, to every hundred weight of Metal, the which is approved a very sufficient Allowance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>To know whether a Piece of Ordnante be truly bored or no.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOu must provide a Pike-staff, about a foot longer than the bore of the Piece, and at the end thereof fasten a Rammer head, that will just fill all the bore to the touch hole; and at the other end of the staff, you must bore a hole big enough to put through a Rod of Iron, which must hand from the same; and at the other end of the Rod must be made a weight about the bigness of a Saker Shot, this is done to make the Pike-staff and Rammer head to lie with the same side upward when they are taken out of the Piece, as they did when they were within the Piece; then you must put your Instrument thus prepared into the Piece, letting the Iron Ball (that is at the end of the Rod, which is put through the hole bored a cross the Pike-staff) hand per∣pendicular; then take your priming Iron, or some other bodkin, and put it down the touch hole to the Rammer head, making a mark therewith; this done, draw out your Instrument, and lay the same on a long Table, with the Iron Ball hanging off the end perpendicular, as it did when the Instrument was in the Piece; then observe, whether the mark you made upon the Rammer head when it was in the Piece, be just upon the uppermost part of the same, if it be, the bore of the Piece lies neither to the right hand nor to the left; but if you find it any thing to the right or left hand, so much lyeth the bore either to the right or left, and the Piece in Shooting must be or∣dered and charged accordingly.</P>
<P>But if you would know whether the bore lie more upwards or downwards, then bend a Wire at the very end, so that it being put in at the very touch hole, may ketch at the metal when it is drawn out, then put the Wire down the touch hole till it touch
<PB N="47" REF="26"/> the bottom of the metal in the Chamber, then holding it in that place, make a mark upon the wire just even with the touch hole, after draw up the wire until it ketch at the metal on the top of the Chamber, and holding it there, make a mark as before; the difference between the two marks is the just wideness of the Chamber, and the distance between the first mark and the end of the Wire (having half the Diameter of the Chamber of the Piece substracted from it) will leave half the Diameter of the Piece, if the Piece be true bored; but if the Piece's number be more than half the Diameter of the Piece, the bore lieth too far from the touch hole, and the upper part of the me∣tal is thickest, but if lesser, the lower part of the metal is thickest or hath most metal.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the necessary Instruments for a Gunner, with several other necessary things.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Master Gunner intending upon service, ought most chiefly to be prepared with these Instruments, as Calabers, Compasses, height board, Sight Rule, Gun∣ners Scale, and a Gunners quadrant; to divide as well into 12 as 90 equal parts, with a Geometrical Square, to make Montures, Levels, heights, Breadths, Distances, and Profundities, (of which you shall read more in the Second Part;) also with a little brass Level, Scales, Weights, Priming-Irons, Moulds to make Cross-bar Shot for Mus∣quets, a Book of Accompts, and an Iron wire or Spring, and a Transome to dispart a Piece of Ordnance; that the Transome may go up and down according to the Dia∣meter and thickness of the Piece, let the Transom be long enough to reach the base Ring, from the touch hole. In the next place he ought to be very expert in the know∣ledg of cutting out, making up, and finishing all sorts of Ladles, Spunges, Rammers, Cartredges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For which purpose you may have Recourse to the foregoing Ta∣ble. And because it may somtimes happen by reason of the steepness, badness and une∣venness of the way, you may be driven to dismount and remount your Piece, e're you get up to the top of a Hill; therefore you must carry with you a Gynn and a Wynch, with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging; as wind Ropes, an Iron Goats-foot, with a Crow, Pins, Truckles, Pullies to help you at a dead lift.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="29" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The making of Rammers, Spunges, Ladles, and Cartredges, Formers, Carriages, Wheels, Trucks</HI> &amp;c. <HI>with the Height of Shot fit for any Piece.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr the better expedition of this work we have in the former Table shewed the length and breadth of each Ladle, always remembring that you cut each Ladle somewhat longer, that is, allowing so much more as must be fastned to the staff, or so much as the staff goes within the Plate.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="27"/>
<P>The Buttons or heads of the Ladles must be near the height of the shot.</P>
<P>For Spunges, the bottoms and heads must be of soft wood, as Birch and Willow, and to be one Diameter and three quarters in length, and three quarters or very little less of the height covered with Sheeps skin, and nayled with Copper nayles, so that together they may fill the hollow of the Piece; Let the bottoms and heads of the Rammers be made of good hard wood, and the height, one Diameter of the Shot, and the length one third of the Diameter of the Shot.</P>
<P>To make Ladles for Chamber bor'd Pieces, open your Compasses to the just Di∣ameter of the Chamber within one eighth part of an Inch, Divide that measure in two equal parts, then set the measure to one of them, and by that distance upon a flat or paper draw a Circle, the Diameter of that Circle is one fourth part shor∣ter than the Diameter of the Chamber; Take three fifths of that Circle for the breadth of the Plate of the Ladle. But for Cannon, the length ought to be twice and two third parts, to hold at twice the just Diameter of the Powder. As for Example,</P>
<P>The Diameter of a Circle drawn for a Cannon whose Chamber bore is 7 Inches, containeth six and three quarters, the circumference whereof is 21 Inches 6/7, and three fourth parts thereof is 12 ¾, and so much ought the Ladle to be in breadth, and in length 18 ⅔ parts. By this Rule you may make a Ladle for any Taper'd Piece.</P>
<P>Take notice for a general observation, that a Ladle 9 balls in length, and two balls in breadth, will near contain the just weight in Powder, that the Iron Shot for any piece weigheth.</P>
<P>Lastly, for Cartredges, they are generally made of paper Royal or Canvas. Take the height of the bore of your piece without the vent of the Shot, and cut the cloath or paper of 3 such heights, for the Cannon in length 3 Diameters, for the Culve∣rin 4 Diameters, for the Saker and Faulcon <HI>&amp;c.</HI> half of the height of their proper bores, and leaving in the midst at the top or bottome one other such height, to make a bottom for the Cartredge, cutting each side somthing larger for Sewing, glewing, or pasting them together; you must have a great care to augment the goodness of your powder, and likewise the heating of your Piece, and so augment or diminish the quantity of Powder.</P>
<P>Let your Former be made to your Ordnance to the height of your Shot, and a convenient length longer than the Cartredge ought to be, and tallow it over first that the paper may slip off, and then put your paper on your Former. If you make your Cartredge of Canvas, half a Diameter more is allowed for seams, but if you make it of paper, half or three quarters of an Inch over-plus for pasting will serve, be∣ing lapt once about the Former; having the bottom fitted upon the end of the Former, which must be hard and close pasted by the lower side of the Cartredge, then let the lower end of the Cartredge be pasted down hard round about the bottom, and let them be well dryed before you fill them, and mark them how high they must be filled.</P>
<P>And if you have no Scales nor weights by you for Cannons, put two Diameters and a half for the height the powder must come, for Culverin 3 Diameters, for Saker 3 and a half Diameters, for lesser Pieces four Diameters of the Cylinder.</P>
<P>For Carriages of Pieces of Ordnance for Land service the Rules are given thus one and a half the length of the Cylender is the length of the Carriage, and in depth four Diameters of the bore of the Piece at the fore end, in the middle three and a half, and at the end next the ground two and a half, let the thickness be the Diameter of the Shot, the wheels should be one half of the length of the Piece in height, but for Sa∣ker and Minion you must exceed the former proportion by one twelfth part, the Faulcon and Faulconet by the sixth part.</P>
<P>The Naves, the Cheeks called Limbres, and wheels, are usually made of Elm, but the Transoms, Axeltreces, Fore-Carriage and Cross beams, are made of Oaken Timber.</P>
<P>For drawing of Guns by men in case horses be wanting, there is usually allowed to every sixty, eighty, or a hundred weight of metal to one man, according to the na∣ture of the ground whereon they are to be drawn.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="27"/>
<P>As for Sea Carriages, they are so well known to every Carriage-maker that they need not to be spoken of.</P>
<P>As for fitting Shot to each Piece, it is the opinion of most Gunners, that every Piece of Ordnance ought to have its Shot within one quarter of an Inch of the Diameter of the bore; others do say, that the one and twentieth part of the Diameter of the Piece's Cylender is more proper and correspondent for all sorts of Pieces whatsoever; Eve∣ry man may make choice of that which by experience he finds best.</P>

First, cleer your Piece within with the Scowrer, and see that the touch hole be clear, and not stopped, and so clear, that no dirt or filth be in the same; Then let him that is by to assist, (for a Piece cannot be man∣naged by less than two) bring the Budg-barrel with the powder just before the mouth of your Piece, put then your Ladle into the same and fill it, and if it be over-full, give it a little jog, that the overplus may fall down again into the barrel; after this, put it gently in at the mouth of the Piece, even until the end of the Ladle be thrust up to the Britch end of the Piece; then must you turn the Ladle gently and softly, and let it lie within the Chamber of the piece, drawing out your Ladle almost to the Muzzle of the Piece, put it back again to take up the loose corns, which were spilt by the way, and to bring them up to the Charge of powder; this done, the Gunner must draw out his Ladle, and take out of the Budg-barrel a second Ladle full, (by our former Rules given he must know the quantity of powder that his Piece will re∣quire) and so putting it in the Piece up to the former Ladle-full, then you may draw it out, and do as you did before, that no loose corns may lie in the bottom of the Piece; and in drawing out his Ladle, he must have a care that he let not fall any powder upon the ground; for it is a thing uncomly in a Gunner, to trample powder under feet. Then take a wisp of Straw, Hay, or any other thing, and put it hard in at the mouth of the Piece, then turn your Ladle end for end to come to the Rammer, thrust it in∣to the Piece after the wisp, and drive it up with it, and it will carry all the loose corns which possibly may be scattered in the Mold of the Piece; having driven the wad up to the powder, give it two or three gentle shoves to make it lie close only, but drive it not too hard least you break your powder too much, which would hinder its force; The wisp or wad being close to the powder, draw out the Rammer and put in the Bullet, which rowle gently in the Piece up to the wad that was before put in to keep up the powder; the Shot being in, put in a second wad after the Bullet, and thrust it also home to
<PB N="50" REF="28"/> the Bullet. Always remembring whilst the powder is putting in and wadding up, one be ready at the touch hole and keep it stopt with his thumb, that no powder fly out at the touch hole, but that it be likewise filled with powder, which may be supplyed out of his powder-horn.</P>
<P>The Gunner that Loads a Piece is to be very careful, and indeavour always not to stand before the muzzle of his Piece whilst he is loading the Piece, but on one side of the same, least a danger or mischief might happen to him. And thus the Piece ha∣ving its due Charge of Powder and Bullet, he must cover the touch-hole with an Apron made of Lead, or for want of that, with dryed Sheep-skin; then let him level his piece and set away the Budg-barrel of powder with the rest of his things, in some hollow place under the ground covered over safe; he must then attend the Gentleman of the Ordnance, or other chief Commander, their Order or Command, before he give fire.</P>
<P>Touching the Charges of Pieces, I have given full instructions necessary there∣unto, with the weight of powder and Shot for any piece. But to say something here touching the quantity of powder, proper for a Load; we do find some dif∣ference amongst Authors; Some whereof do maintain, that there ought to be allow∣ed to every Piece for its Charge so much powder as half the weight of the Bullet; o∣thers are of the opinion, that the more powder is put into a Piece, the swifter and farther the Bullet will flye, urging many reasons to prove it. But experience, the Mistress of this Art instructeth us better, for if a Piece be loaden with two thirds of the weight of her Shot in powder, it sends the Bullet or Shot going more swiftly, and will carry it farther, which hath been very many and often times tryed, so that at this time, 'tis without contradiction.</P>
<P>Again, others do maintain, that if one should forcibly Ramme the Bullet, then the powder might take fire before it cast forth the Bullet, and then would cause the Bul∣let to flye farther than otherwise it would do; but you must consider in so doing, you either endanger the breaking of the piece, or else the making it crooked and unser∣viceable; because your ordinary Pieces will not bear so great a Charge of powder. This hath been tryed by the Sea side before his Excellency <HI>Prince Maurice,</HI> of famous memory, where first one and the same Piece was Loaden with ten pound of fine pow∣der, to see how far She would carry the Bullet; the place being marked where the Bullet rested. The Piece was loaden again with nine pounds of powder which shot as far as when the Piece was Loaden with ten pounds of powder. But last of all, this piece of Ordnance being Loaden or Charged with 7 pounds of the same powder, it carried her Bullet further than the two former Shots; whence one may observe that a piece of Ordnance may be over-Charged, and therefore a good Gunner ought to have a singular care to give unto his Piece her due measure and Charge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Office and Duty of a Gunner, with all his Properties, Endowments and qualifications.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE that intends to be a Master Gunner, and would not abuse himself nor others of the same profession, must be qualified according to our Instructions follow∣ing, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>He ought to be well skilled in Arithmetick, and to understand the Extraction of the Square and Cube Roots, and to have knowledge in Geometry, according to our
<PB N="51" REF="28"/> Instructions in the second part, whereby he may be able to take heights, depths, breadths and lengths, and to draw the plot of any piece of ground, to make Mines and Countermines, Rampars, Baskets of earth, and such like things used in time of war, as well offensive as defensive.</P>
<P>He ought most chiefly upon Land-Service to be well skilled in the making Plat∣formers, with Defences, Troniers, Gabbions, Loops, Parapets of Earth, and Pag∣gots of 23 or 24 foot high; two foot high of Earth, bed upon bed, unto eleven foot high, and after three foot <HI>Terra plene,</HI> to raise the Tronniers and Loops, so that for the Cannon it be three foot wide in the Barbe, and within twelve foot wide, without the lower part thereof to descend Scarp-wise, the better to discover the E∣nemies avenues and offend them more freely, for avoiding the blast and Smoak and ruine it would else make: for Culverin two foot and a half within, and nine foot without will serve; and for less Pieces the less measure.</P>
<P>If the Battery be to be made with Gabbions, they being filled with Earth without Stones, moistned and Rammed 7 foot in Diameter, three Ranks between two Pieces, if the place will permit, or two at least; and three Rows also one before the other, setting one between two, so that if one Rank will have three, the second will have two, and the third one; but it will be hard to make a safe Battery with Gabbions, Cannon or Culverin proof.</P>
<P>Concerning Plat-forms. Let the platform for a Cannon have thirty foot for reverse, and 27 foot for a Demy-Cannon, and he ought to see that his plat-forms be even, or rising one foot for 20 foot backward the better to stay the Reverse, and fa∣cilitate the bringing the piece when Loaden to the Loop. The platform ought to be made clean, that no stones or other things lye in the way for the wheels to run upon, whereby may be hindered the true intent of his Shot.</P>
<P>He must before any service is, examine his Piece of its goodness or defect; according to our former Instructions given in this behalf, he must also be furnished with all necessary things for his Artillery, the particulars thereof we have mentioned in the 29 <HI>Chap.</HI> but because it takes not up much paper we will repeat them here again, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Wheels, Trucks, Axeltrees, Ladles, Rammers, Spunges, Worms, Tampions, height-board, Auger-bit, fitness and roundness of the Shot, Chane-Shot, Cross∣bar Shot <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Canvas or strong paper for Cartredges, Calabers, Compasses, Sight Rule, Gunners Scale, Quadrant, Scales, Weights, priming-Irons, and Aprons to cover the Touch hole.</P>
<P>Before he come upon Service, he ought to examine and prove the goodness of his Powder and Match, and examine it according to the Rules given where we treat of the Examination of the goodness of Powder.</P>
<P>A Gunner ought to be most careful to see that the Powder be placed safely from danger of his own, as also the Enemies Ordnance, and to be furnished with artificial Torches, Dark Lanthorns, with all sorts of Fire-works, of which you shall have a particular account in the Treatise of Fire-works at the end of this Book.</P>
<P>He must have by him his Gyn and Winch, Hand-Spikes, Crowes, to mount and dismount Guns at pleasure as occasion may serve, also Coynes, Budge-Barrels, Powder Baskets to carry Shot to your Piece, to keep his Linstocks well armed with good Match.</P>
<P>He must alwayes have by him a Ruler, Scale, Compasses, to measure the Dia∣meters or Bore of every Piece, and likewise the length of the Cylinder within, the better to fit her with due Shot and Proportion of Powder.</P>
<P>He must learn by such Instructions as we have already given, the Names, Length, Weight, and Fortification of every Piece about the Chamber, and to tell readily how much Powder is a due Charge for every Piece, and what Shot is neces∣sary. How many Persons must attend in time of Service, how many Horses or Oxen will draw a Piece of Ordnance, and in case they be wanting, how many men will serve. How many pound weight of Shot one man may drive before him in a Wheel-barrow from place to place.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="29"/>
<P>A Gunner ought chiefly to Charge and Discharge a Piece of Ordnance Artist like; and when he opens, or orders to be opened the head of a Powder Barrel, let no Iron Tool be used thereunto for fear of taking or striking fire; for that purpose therefore it is usual to have wooden Mallets, which will prevent such dangers.</P>
<P>Every Gunner before he beginneth to make a Shot, ought to consider that a wad of Hay, or of untwisted Ropes, will make the Shot shoot wide of the Mark.</P>
<P>He ought to consider whether the Trunions be placed in their due place in the Carriage, whether the Carriage have its due length, whether one wheel be not higher than the other, or whether one wheel doth not reverse quicker or sooner than the other, for these will cause the Piece to erre, and to shoot wide of the Mark.</P>
<P>Every Gunner ought to consider, that if his Piece lye point blank or under Metal, then he ought to put in a sufficient wad after the Shot, to keep it close to the Powder; for if it should not be close, great danger might follow; for if the Shot should lodge any distance from the Powder, then in the firing of that Piece it would break off in that very vacant place between the Shot and the Powder, and so do dammage to himself or standers by. If your Piece be mounted, you then use no wad at all after the Shot.</P>
<P>Every Gunner ought to have standing by him some Tubs of water to wet his Spunges in, whereby to cool his Piece in time of Service, as also to be ready upon occasion to put out any Fire that might happen in time of Service.</P>
<P>Every Gunner ought to try whether his Piece is truely bored or not; if it be not, he is to take it into consideration, and to order his proportion of Charge, according to the thinnest part of the Metal, to prevent all danger.</P>
<P>A Gunner ought to take his Observation of the Mark or place he intends to direct his Shot to, just over the middle of the bore within the Piece, for by this means he may be able, by his Skill, to make a true Shot in a bad Piece.</P>
<P>A Gunner, that he may the better direct his Shot to the place desired, ought to consider the difference of the Metal of the Piece at Britch and Muzzle, and thereby truely how to dispart a Piece, be it either true bored or not. Of disparting a Piece, I shall shew how it may be done several wayes in the following or second part of this Gunnery; where we come to the practical part of the Art in handling a Piece of Ordnance upon all occasions.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Use of this Quadrant in taking the Perpen∣dicular or direct height, by help of the Suns sha∣dow.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>COnvey the left side of the Quadrant Geometrically towards the Sun, the Thread and Plummet having their free course, moving it up or down until both your sights have received the Sun-beams; then if your Thread be found in the twelfth part, all things that are upright or truly perpendicularly elevated, are equal in height with their shadows.</P>
<P>If the Thread with the plummet be observed to cut any of those parts next the sights, called right shadow, between <HI>m</HI> and <HI>h,</HI> then every upright thing is more than the sha∣dow, by such a proportion as 12 exceeds the parts where the Thread was found.</P>
<P>If the Thread fall upon the first division, then 12 times the shadow is the height. If it fall upon the second Division, 6 times the shadow is the height. If it fall upon the third Division, 4 times the shadow is the height. If it fall on the fourth Division, 3 times the shadow is the height. In the fifth Division twice and two fifths of the shadow is the height. In the sixth twice, in the seventh once, and five sevenths in the eighth Division, one and a half in the ninth, one and a third in the tenth, one and a fifth part in the eleventh, once and the eleventh part of the shadow is the height on the twelfth part, then the length of the shadow is the height, as we said before.</P>
<P>Or in few words it may be done thus, Multiply the length of the shadow by 12, the product divided by the parts in which you found the Thread, your quotient sheweth the height.</P>
<P>But if the part cut be on the contrary shadow, that is, if the Thread fall between <HI>g</HI> and <HI>m,</HI> augment then the length of the shadow by the parts declared by the plummet, and the increase divide by 12, and the product is the Altitude.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><LABEL>Example.</LABEL> In the Foregoing figure it is plainly to be perceived, when the figure falleth upon the 12 Division, the shadow is equal with the thing it self; In the 6 of the right, it
<PB N="56" REF="31"/> is but half, in the 6 of the contrary it is twice the height, and so to conclude, as the side in the right exceeds the parts, so doth the Altitude the shadow; and the contrary in the contrary shadow. Behold the figure 6 where you will find the Thread cutteth 6 parts of the contrary shadow upon the Quadrant, the shadow B C then being 210 foot, multiply (as I have said) the length of the shadow 210 foot by 6, the parts cut by the Thread, and it makes 1260, and that divided by 12 riseth 105, which is the Altitude of such a body, that casts a shadow of 210 feet.</P>
<P>Also the height of any unknown thing may be known by taking the length of its shadow, and the length of the shadow of any staff set upright whose length is known, saying, as the length of its shadow is to its height, so the length of the shadow of the unknown thing is to its height.</P>

Deduct your first distance from the third, so re∣maineth the Divisor; then multiply your third distance by your second, and the pro∣duct divide by your Divisor, the quotient sheweth the true length from the third staff to the fortress or mark desired: for plainness behold the figure.</P>

<P>Now you must measure how many Paces, Halbeards, or Pikes length, are between your first and second Staff, deducting that from the distance between the third and fourth, and the Remainder shall serve you for a Divisor; then multiply your di∣stance between the second and fifth Staff by the distance between the third and fourth, the product divide by your reserved Divisor, and it yieldeth in the Quotient the true distance between these two Marks. See the foregoing Figure.</P>

<P>Let A B be the two Marks, whose distance I would measure; my standing place where I set up my first Staff, I; in the middle, my Triangle made of three Staves, Hal∣berds, Bills, or any such like things, K L M; the Staves or Halberds of which I make my Triangle N, which I first place at C, secondly at D, thirdly at E; and note, at C and D the scituation of the Triangle is all one, but at E it somewhat differeth, as you may behold in this Figure, which I would have you note, lest haply you be de∣ceived in your practice.</P>
<P>C E the distance between the first and third, deducted from D F the distance be∣tween the second and fourth, there remains H F your Divisor; which measured, I admit 50 Halberds lengths, the distance between G E 30 Halberds lengths, the space between D F 100 Halberds length, now 100 multiplyed by 30 produceth 3000, which divided by 50, leaveth in the Quotient 60. I conclude therefore the distance between A and B to be 60 Pikes lengths.</P>
<P>This one thing is to be taken notice of especially, that whatsoever you mete the space G E withall, that you use the same in measuring H F; and as for D F it matters not what you measure it withall, for your Quotient shall bear the same denomina∣tion. Preciseness is to be used in placing of your Triangle, and in measuring E G, and H F, otherwise error may ensue; especially if D F be but a small distance, and the Angle at B very sharp. There needeth in this matter no further admonition, small Practice will resolve all doubts.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>LEt your Angles, as before hath been said, be prepared of any three Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you shall first at pleasure set up one Staff, and applying thereunto your Angle in such sort, that the one containing side lye directly to one of the Marks (which here for distinction sake I will call the first) go backwards too and fro until you find your second Mark precisely covered with your Staff, nothing what part of the line or side subtending the Angle it cuts by your line visual, and there make a fine notch or mark upon that subtending Staff; which done, you shall go sidewise from the first erected Staff, as the other containing side of your Triangle will direct you, so far as you list,
<PB N="63" REF="35"/> and then set up your second Staff; yet pass on from thence in a right line with that containing side of your Angle that riseth from your Staves, and cometh somewhat toward the Mark, and go so far until you spy your self just between your third Staff and your first mark, there set up your fourth Staff; then resort to your Angle again, and standing behind the second Staff, note whither a right line from the Angle to that notch (before made on the subtendent Staff or side of the Triangle) will direct you, for that way precisely shall you go on until you come in a right line with the second and third Staff, and erect there the fifth Staff; this done, measure the distance be∣tween the second and third Staff, reserving that for a Divisor; then multiply your distance between the first and third Staff, by the distance between the fourth and fifth Staff, the product divide by your reserved Divisor, and it yieldeth in the Quotient the true distance between the two marks.</P>

<P>Let A B be the distance I would know, C my first Station where the first Staff is erected; I my Triangle made of three Staves, and placed at the Station C, directed with one of the containing sides to A, which is the first mark, as you may see in the Figure, and with the other side to D and E the second and third Staves; H is the notch or mark upon the side subtended to the Angle, where the line visual from C passeth to the second mark B; my Triangle now I scituate at D, as it was before at C, the one contained side lying even with the erected Staves, the other directed to my fourth Staff F, placed in a right line with E the third Staff, and A the first mark. Again, my line visual proceeding from D to H, the notch in the subrended side of the Angle is extended to my fifth Staff G, scituated exactly between E the third Staff, and B the other mark: This done, I measure the distance between my second and third Staff, finding it 20 foot; likewise between the fourth and fifth Staff, and find it 72 foot; finally between the first and third Staff 65 paces; so that according to the Rule before given, multiplying 65 by 72, I have 4680. which divided by 20, yieldeth in the Quotient 234, and so many paces is there between A and B.</P>

<P><HI>How you may readily find out the distance to any Tower, Castle, Forts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>by help of the former Quadrant.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LEt the Quadrant be made upon a square Board as is there marked A D B Q. Let D B be divided into 90 Degrees or equal parts; and instead of the 12 equal parts, or right and contrary shadows, <HI>g m</HI> and <HI>h m,</HI> let the two sides D Q and B Q be divided each into 1200 equal parts, or as many as you please, and marked from the Center A, and have a Ruler or Index to be moved round upon the Center A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having two sights upon it, set just upon the feducial line of the Index, and let it be divided into such equal parts as the Lymb B Q, or D Q.</P>
<P>Let this Instrument thus fitted be handsomly placed upon its Staff, or otherwise, lay the feducial of your Index upon the beginning of the Degrees of the Quadrant, and turn your whole Instrument (the Index not moved) till you may espy through the sight your mark, then remove your Index to the contrary side of the Quadrant, placing the line feducial on the side line where the degrees end, and look through the sights, and in that very line set up a mark a certain distance, the farther the better; this done, take away your Instrument, and set up a Staff there, and remove the In∣strument to the mark you espyed; set your Index on the beginning of the Degrees, moving your whole Instrument, till you find through the Sights the Staff at the first Station, then remove your Index (your Quadrant keeping its place) till you may again espy through the Sights your mark; which done, note the Degrees cut by the line feducial, and then work thus, upon some even smooth Superficies, whether it be Board, Plate, or Paper: Draw first a streight line, and open your Compasses to some small distance, call that space a score, and make so many such divisions upon your Line as there is scores between your Stations; then upon the end of your line raise a perpendicular, and fixing one foot of your Compasses at the other end, open∣ing it to what wideness you please, draw an Arch rising from the same line that represents your Stationary distance, and dividing it into 90 equal parts or Degrees (as you was taught in the making your Quadrant) extend from the Center to the number of Degrees cut by your feducial line, a right line, until it concur with the perpendicular before erected; then see how much of that space (which representeth the score in dividing your Stationary distance) is contained in the perpendicular; so many score is the mark off from your first Station, and by dividing the Hypothenusal line, you may find the Distance from the second Station.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>How to make a true Dispart of any true bored Piece of Ordnance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>KNow first, that to dispart a Piece of Ordnance, is no otherwise than to bring the Diameter at Muzzle to be equal to the Diameter at the Base Ring; in true founde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ordnance, half of the Diameter of the Cylender is the dispart; but more generally it may be done thus, Gird the Piece round about the Britch with a thred, after do the like by the Muzzle Ring, lay these two strings streight upon a Table at length, and make two marks for the length of each string; divide the distance between each of these two marks into 22 equal parts with your Compasses, and 7 of them are their Diameters; then measure how much each Diameter is in length, and substract one Diameter from the other, then take the just half of the difference, and that is the true dispart of your Piece in inches, and part of an inch.</P>
<P>But these Diameters are better and more artificially taken with a pair of Crallipars, as we have shewed before in taking the Diameter of a Shot, and then measured upon your Scale of inches and parts, will give you the true Diameters of the Piece both at Britch and Muzzle, with which work as above.</P>
<P>Also you may find the true dispart of a Piece thus; Put a small Wyer or priming Iron in at the Touch-hole of the Piece to the bottom of the Concave; then mind what part of that Iron is even with the Base Ring, and make a mark there; then take it out and apply it to the Muzzle, and place it upon the lower edge of the Concave of
<PB N="72" REF="44"/> the Piece as upright as you can, and mind what part of the Iron or Wyer is even with the upper part of the Muzzle Ring, and there make a mark; for the difference between these two marks, is the true dispart of the Piece: or after you have placed your Iron upon the Muzzle as before, cause a dispart to be raised so high as that mark which was made upon the Iron when 'twas put down the Touch-hole.</P>
<P>If from the top of the dispart a fine thread or line be carried to the Muzzle Ring, you will see how high you may make a dispart at the Trunions.</P>
<P>Or thus a dispart may be made at the Trunions; lay a peece of soft Wax upon the Trunions, and let one raise it high, or depress it, until that the Metal at the top of the Base Ring, the Wax between the Trunions, and the dispart of the Muzzle, be all three of one height precisely; but the former way with a thread is more exact.</P>
<P>A Piece of Ordnance may be disparted thus; take two sticks (each of them must be longer than the Piece) and also make a Plummet of Lead to hang in a small thread made fast to one end of the stick, which lay cross the top of the Base Ring, to and fro, until the Plummet descending from the end thereof, may just touch the side of the Metal of the said Ring; then keeping fast the stick in that place, hang your Plum∣met down by the other side of the stick, until it on the otherside just touch the Metal of the Base Ring; when you have done, cut off the stick just in that place by which the Plummet descended, perpendicularly, and this length is the just Diameter of the Base Ring; after this manner you must proceed to take the Diameter at the Muzzle. Then lastly, set these two sticks together even at one end, and mark their difference in length or height; for just half of that difference is the dispart of that Piece.</P>
<P>I would advise all Sea Gunners upon some occasions to use Disparts between the Trunions of their Pieces, made of a just height, on purpose to serve that place, by the method we have even now prescribed, and let them be tyed about the Piece with a twine, because else at every Shot they will be to seek, when upon a suddain they should use them, and they will much avail and stand them in great stead. I could express other wayes, only I think these sufficient.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How to give Level with a Piece of Ordnance to make a Shot at any Mark assigned.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SEt your dispart on the Muzzle Ring, just over the Center of the mouth of the Piece, which you may best do by putting a stick cross the bore, and dividing it into two equal parts; then with a Plumb line hanging over the mouth of the Piece, being guided by the divided stick, you shall have good aim where to set your Dispart; this being done, go to the Base Ring, if the Piece be true bored, then find which is the highest part, and middle of that Ring; but if the Piece be not true bored, then find which part of the Base Ring is just over the Cylender, and take that for your true line: when you have found out the dispart, and placed it, and also found what point in the Base Ring is to answer to it, then make some very small mark on the Base Ring in that place, hold your head about two foot from the Base Ring, and there you may best observe, as the Piece is traversing, when you are in a direct line with the mark; this done, give one of your men order to raise and fall the Piece with his Hand-spike as you shall appoint him, until you can, holding your head two foot from the Britch of the Piece, with your eye perceive the mark at the Base Ring, and the top of the dispart in a direct line with the mark you must shoot at; at that instant stop the motion of the Piece with a Coyn, that it may remain as you have directed it; then Prime your Piece, and give fire.</P>

<P>Before you place your Dispart, you are to take notice whether the ground be Level whereon the Wheels of the Gun stand, or if they be not one higher than the other, and if the Trunions stand just over the Axeltree of the Wheels or no; whether one Trunion lye higher on the Carriage than the other: whether the Gun be truely placed in the Carriage or not; that is, that it be not nearer one side than the other: whether the Carriage be truly made according to the direction we have already pre∣scribed in the first part; whether the Axeltree be placed just cross the Carriage or not.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How, if a Shot do carry to the right or to the left, under or over the mark, by reason of some known fault, to amend it in making the next Shot.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter you have made one Shot, and find the Piece carry just over the mark, then do all that has been taught again, and when your Piece lyes directly against the mark, observe how much the last stroak of the Shot is above the mark, so much longer make your dispart, that the top of it may be just seen from the Britch of the Piece, in a direct line with the stroke of the Shot; when it is of this length, then level your Piece with this new dispart to the assigned mark, Give fire, and without doubt it will strike the same.</P>
<P>If the first Shot strike under the mark, then bring the Piece in all points as before to pass, mark how much of the dispart is over the stroke of the Shot, and cut it just so short, as being at the Britch you may discern the top of it, with the mark on the Base Ring and stroke of the Shot in a just right line, and when you perceive it is of such a length, level the Piece to the assigned mark, as at the first, then Prime and Give fire.</P>
<P>If the first Shot strike on the right hand of the mark, to mend it you must level the Piece as formerly; you standing behind the Britch of the Piece, observe the stroke of the Shot over the dispart, and that part of the Base Ring as you at that instant look over in a right line towards the dispart, and the stroke of the Shot, set up in that place a Pin with a little soft Wax on the Base Ring; so this Pin will be in a right line with the dispart and stroke of the Shot: This being done, level your Piece to the mark assigned by this Pin and the dispart, and without question you will make a fair Shot; for when you level by the Metal of the Base Ring where the Pin is placed, and the mark of the Piece standing at that direction, look over the top of the dispart from the notch in the Base Ring, and you shall find it to lye just so much to the left, as the former Shot struck to the right, from the assigned mark, which should in all likelyhood now strike the mark.</P>
<P>But if a Shot be both too wide and too low, then you must use both the directions above taught, to make the next Shot: first regulate the dispart by cutting it shorter, according as the Shots mark is lower than the assigned mark; when this is done, then proceed to my directions to mend shooting wide, and these things performed with care and diligence, cannot choose but mend a bad Shot.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of shooting at Random at a Mark beyond the right line of the Pieces reach, or right Range of a Shot; and the way of framing a Table of Randoms, by help of the Gunners Quadrant.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr the effecting of this matter, we must have a Quadrant with a Thread and Plummet (which is described in the first Chapter of this second Section) to one side of this Quadrant; so that one end of the Ruler may go into the Cavity of the Piece, and let a Piece of Lead be fastned to the end of the Rule, to make it lye close to the bottom of the Metal within, the Quadrant hanging without, and the Plumb-line swaying or hanging down from the Center of the Quadrant, perpendicular to the Ho∣rizontal line; for the Quadrant being thus placed, you may mount a Piece to what degree you shall find fit to shoot by.</P>
<P>Now every one that will learn to shoot at Random, must draw his Piece on a level ground, where first shooting level, he must observe that distance in feet or paces, then mount his Piece to one degree, and mark where that shall graze; thus finding the distance of every degree from the level to the tenth degree, by these distances make a Table, to which annex the degrees against the distance; by which Table you may (using the Art of Proportions) find how far another Piece will convey her Shot from degree to degree, and in Loading your Piece for this work you must have your Powder exactly weighed, and likewise the Wad, and let the Piece cool of it self, and this you must do every time; and if the Piece be mounted, there needs no Wad after the Shot; also you must have a special care of the strength of the Powder, and let the Powder equally, and with the same force and strength be pressed home, as near as possible you may.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>An effectual way to make a Shot out of a Piece of Ordnance at Random.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE that intends to be expert at these things, ought principally to endeavour, at one time or another, to obtain so much liberty of his Superior Comman∣ders, as to make two, three, or more Shot with the Piece he chooseth, or intends for most Service; then must he measure the distance from the Platform to the first graze of the Shot; and must apply it to the Table, which I have here inserted, being the expe∣rience of such as have been knowing Gunners. But first I shall set down Mr. <HI>Nye</HI> of <HI>Worcester</HI>'s Experiment, not as he is Mathematician, as he writes himself (which Title none of our Learned Mathematicians of <HI>England</HI> do assume) but as he was a Practical Gunner, and made these several experiments upon four several degrees of Mounture, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 deg. 5 deg. 7 deg. 10 deg. from thence was found these Randoms.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
<P>At 1 degree, the Shot did light from the Piece or place of standing 225 paces.</P>
<P>At 5 degrees, the Random was 416 paces.</P>
<P>At 7 degrees, the Random was 505 paces.</P>
<P>At 10 degrees the Random was 630 paces.</P>
<P>And by these Experiments a Table may be framed according to this Rule. As the known degree of Mounture, is to the number of paces the Piece carries; so is the number of degrees proposed, to the distance required.</P>
<P>The use of this Table will plainly appear in one onely Example.</P>

<P>Suppose you make tryal of your Piece of Ordnance, ac∣cording to the method prescribed in the last Chapter, and find that at 6 degrees of Random upon a level ground, the Shot is conveyed 619 paces, and you are to ply your Piece against a place which lyes beyond the point blank, the di∣stance being 498 paces, to know the degree the Piece must be elevated too, do thus; in this Table of Randoms against 6 degrees, there is 461 paces; then say as 619 paces is to 461, so is 498 to 375; which number, or the nearest to being sought, in this Table is 370, and stands against 4 degrees, but because it is not exactly the same number, you must find out the part of a degree or minute, by a Table of proportio∣nal parts; but if the mark you shoot at be lower or higher than your Platformer, then you must add or substract so many degrees or minutes from the degrees and minutes found, and the remainder is the degree you ought to mount your Piece to.</P>
<P>Now that we may be understood well, we must know that there are two sorts of Ranges or Motions of a Shot, of which you may see more in Chap. 20. the one is called the Right Range, and the other is termed the Curved or Crooked Range, and these two there termed a Compound Range, is called the Dead Range, that is to say, the whole distance from your Platform from whence the Shot was made, to the place where the Bullet first grazes; yet the perpendicular descending of the Bullet is also called the Natural motion, as you may see by the figure hereafter placed. Captain <HI>Hexham</HI> in his Book of Gunnery, shews how by finding out the Random of a Cannon for the first degree of Mounture to find the Random for every degree to 45 de∣grees, which is the utmost Random, after this manner; First, find out how many paces the Cannon will shoot, being laid level by the Metal (which he accounts for one degree of Mounture) divide this distance by 50, then multiply the Quotient by 11, and that will bring out the number of the greatest digression or difference between Range and Range, which being divided by 44, the Quotient will shew the number of paces which the Bullet will loose in the other Ranges from degree to degree. <HI>Example.</HI> A Battering Cannon being laid by the Metal, will shoot his Bullet (as he saith) 1000 ordinary paces, two foot and a half to each pace; which being divided by 50, the Quotient will be 20, which multiplyed by 11, is 220 paces, which is the number of the next digression made in the second degree: which 220 divide by 44, the number of the remaining degrees yields 5, which is the number of paces to be diminished in each degree; and by this Rule this Table is framed.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>This Table is rather proportio∣nal than real, and doth best agree with greater Ordnance; but by help of it, working by the Rule of proportion, you may know the Random of any Piece of Ordnance; by first (as we have said before) making one Shot, and measuring from your Platform that distance. You may make a Table for your Piece thus,</P>
<P>Suppose a Saker being mounted to 5 degrees, shoot the Bullet 416 paces, how far will it shoot being mounted 10 degrees?</P>
<P>As 722 the Tabular distance for 5 degrees of Mounture, is to 416 paces the distance found,</P>
<P>So is the Tabular distance for 10 degrees of Mounture, 1214. to the distance required, which will be found to be 699, 5 paces.</P>
<P>Now if you desire to know how much of the Horizontal line, is contained directly under the right line of any Shot, called the right Range, made out of any Piece at any elevation.</P>
<P>First, know that in plain Triangles, the violent motion or right line of a Shot is supposed to be the Hypothenusal, the Angle of Mounture to be the Angle at Base; these are given, and the Horizontal line is the Base which is to be found; there the proportion will run thus;</P>
<PB N="78" REF="48"/>
<P>As the Radius 90 deg. is to the number of paces in a right Range;</P>
<P>So is the Sine Complement of the Angle of Mounture, to the Horizontal Base, or the right line which lyes parallel to the Horizon under the way of the Shot.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the violent, crooked, and natural motion or way of a Shot, from the time he is discharged, until it is descended.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the third and fourth propositions of the second Book of <HI>Tartagilia,</HI> his <HI>Nova Scientia,</HI> he sheweth that every body equally heavy, as a Shot in the end of the violent motion thereof, being discharged out of a Piece of Ordnance, so it be not right up or right down, the curved Range shall joyn with the right Range, and to the natural course and motion betwixt them both, which distinct motions you may see in the last foregoing figure.</P>
<P>In the 17 proposition of the same Book, he proveth that every Shot equally heavy, great or little, equally elevated above the Horizon, or equally oblique or level di∣rected, are among themselves like, and proportional in their distance, as the figure following sheweth, as A E F is like and proportional in right and crooked Ranges unto H I, and in their distances or dead Ranges A F unto A I.</P>
<P>And in his 4th and 6th propositions of the same Book, he proveth that every Shot made upon the level hath the mixt or crooked Range thereof equal to the Arch of a Quadrant 90 degrees; and if it be made upon an elevation above the level, that then it will make the crooked Range to be more than a Quadrant: And if that be made imbased under the level, that then the crooked Range thereof will be a Quadrant.</P>
<P>And in his 9th proposition of the same Book, he shews, that if one Piece be Shot off twice, the one level, and the other at the best of her Random at 42 ½ deg. Mounture, that the right Range of the length is but the ½ of the dead range of the best Random. He that desires a further Demonstration of these Propositions, may peruse his said second Book <HI>de Nova Scientia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The making of a Gunners Rule, which will serve for the elevation of a Piece, which is sometimes better than a Quadrant; and the dividing it into degrees by help of a Table, fitting it for any Piece from 5 foot to 14 foot long.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEcause the Quadrant cannot be conveniently used at all times, especially when the wind blows hard, and, being near the Enemies Guns, the Plumb-line is too long before it stands still; to remedy this, the Gunners Rule was invented, the figure hereof is as followeth; it must be 12 or 14 inches long, according as the Gun will require, it must have a long slit down the middle thereof like the Eye-Vane of a Quadrant or back Staff, the head thereof make circular or a little hollow, as you see in the figure the Instrument is described standing, at 'tis to be placed upon the Britch of a Piece of Ordnance; in the middle of the small narrow slit you must place a Lute string or a well twisted Silk with a Bead running upon the same to be set to any number of inches and parts, or to such a degree of the Quadrant, as you must mount your Gun unto; and on the one side of the slit you must place a division of inches, and let every inch be divided into 10 parts, and then it will serve for all sorts of Guns; but if it be for a particular Gun, then on the other side you may place the degrees and parts, when you shall find by the length of your Piece, how many inches and parts of an inch goes to a degree; but to use it with all sorts of Ordnance, let it only be divided into inches and parts.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>To fit this Rule for one Gun only, here is the Rule for the decimation of the degrees; note, this Table hath 11 Columns, the first shews the length of the Piece in feet and half feet, the other 10 Columns in the head are 10 degrees, and under is inches and the 100 parts of an inch, from 1 degree to 10 degrees; and so you may take them out of the Table, and put them on your Ruler.</P>

<P>The use of this Table in graduating the Rule is very plain; for if your Piece of Ordnance be 8 foot long, and you would mount your Piece two degrees, seek for 8 foot under the title length of the Piece, and in the common Angle against the length of the Piece under two degrees you will find 3, 36, to make a degree; that is 3 inches and 36 parts of an inch, divided into 100 parts, and to this you may set your Bead.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="49"/>
<P>The use of the graduated Rule is thus: having loaded your Piece, and brought your Piece of Ordnance in a right line with your mark, the dispart being placed upon the Muzzle Ring, in like manner place your Rule upon the Base Ring, and let one standing by hold it, for the foot of it let it be fitted round to the Gun; so you may be sure to place it right, and you may estimate on its perpendicular well enough; now having before the distance to the mark you intend to shoot at, and admit you have found it to be 461 paces, and the first Shot you made for practice out of that Piece conveyed her Shot at two degrees of Mounture 274 paces; then by our former Rules and the Tables of Randoms, there I find 461 against 6 degrees, which is the degrees I must mount my Piece to reach 461 paces.</P>
<P>Then to find by this Table how many inches and hundred parts of an inch 6 degrees will require, look in the Table above, and find on the left hand in the first Column the length of the Piece, and just under the degrees (as is aforesaid) you shall find the inches and parts of Mounture, to which set your Bead on your string, that is in the sight, to so many inches and parts as the Table gives; then mount the Piece higher or lower, until you bring the Bead to the top of the dispart and mark, all in one line; stop then the Piece in such a position with a Coyn, then prime and give fire.</P>
<P>If you will shoot by the Metal of the Piece without a dispart, then subtract the height of the dispart out of the inches found by the Table, and to the remainder mount your Piece.</P>
<P>If you have no Quadrant nor a Ruler, and would make a good Shot, look in the Table, and find the length of the Piece and the inches that you ought to raise your Piece unto, then cut a peece of stick just of that length, and set it upon the Base Ring, and bring the top of that stick, the top of the dispart, and the mark, all in a right line with your eye, and you will make as good a Shot as if you had a Rule and Bead, or Quadrant.</P>
<P>If you will have no dispart, take your dispart and measure it upon the aforesaid stick at the Base Ring, and from it cut off the length of the dispart, and the remainder use upon the Base Ring.</P>
<P>But if the Mounture should be so small that the inches of the dispart should be more than the inches answerable to the degrees of Mounture; then cut off from the dispart so much as 'tis longer than the other, and place it upon the Muzzle Ring, and bring the upper part of the Base Ring, the dispart, and mark, in a right line with your Eye, and you will this way make a level with a stick without Instrument, as well as if you had Ruler or Quadrant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How to make a Shot at the Enemies Light in a dark night, and to make at a Company of Horse∣men or Footmen passing by, and also to make a good Shot at a Ship Sailing; and how a Shot lodged in a Piece, so that it will not be driven home to the Powder, may be shot out without hurt to the Piece.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO shoot by night at the Enemies Lights, dispart your Piece with a lighted and flaming Wax Candle, or with a lighted Piece of Match, that with your Eye you may bring the Base Ring, the fired Match on the Muzzle Ring, and the Enemies Light, in a right line, or mark; then give fire, and you will make a good Shot.</P>
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>
<P>If you make a Shot at a Company of Horse passing by, take a Piece that will reach the way the Horse or Foot are coming in a right line, then let your Gun be so loaded with Powder as it may presently take fire, and let your Shot be fit for your use; then take notice of some Hillock or some turning cross way for the mark, and when the Enemy comes near to that way in a right line with your Gun, give fire; but for shoot∣ing at a Ship upon the River, you must put your Piece to some eminent mark on the other side of the River, and when the Head of the Ship shall begin to be between the Piece and the mark, then give fire.</P>
<P>But if by some mischievous accident a Shot is lodged in the concavity of a Piece, and there sticks, and will not go home to the Powder, or come out; then the Gunner, to save his Piece from breaking, must imbase the mouth of the Piece, or put it under the line of level, then put in at the Touch-hole fair warm water at several times, so that it may run out at Muzzle or Mouth of the Piece; and when all the Salt-Peter is washed from the Powder, which is known by the taste of the Water, then let the Gunner clear the Touch-hole, and put in as much Powder as possible he can, and prime and give fire, and it will serve to draw out the Shot.</P>
<P>But when a Shot hath lain long in a Piece until he is grown rusty, and so sticks fast, put strong Vinegar warm into the mouth of the Piece, and with the Rammer strike the Shot until it doth move; then put in Vinegar until it run clear through the Powder and Shot; prime as before, and give fire with good Powder, and if it do not run through after it hath stood three dayes, clear the Touch-hole, prime and give fire.</P>
<P>A man may also shoot farther than ordinary in one and the self same Piece, if the Powder be gently driven home, and wadded accordingly; then the Shot being com∣passed with Paper, Leather, Oakam, or such like, to fill close to the Powder with a good Wadd, putting after it a Tampion of Cork, and with a Spunge moisten it with Oyl, annoint the vacant Cylender, and so Barricado the Piece that it may not reverse in the Discharge.</P>

<P>A Town may be assaulted in divers places; sometimes you assault one side, when as you make your Battery on another; sometimes you choose a Bulwark, other∣whiles a Curtain to be battered, with this intention, to take in the Town as soon as possible may be. As for me, if I were to take in a great Town which is populous, I had rather choose to batter a <HI>Curtain,</HI> than a <HI>Bulwark,</HI> which hath a high catt, or mount upon it: especially, seeing that in great Towns the Bulwarks lying one far from another, they do show the skirt of the Curtain very open.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why would you rather choose a Curtain than a Bulwark?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because your Bulwarks are alwayes stronger, and better fortified than your Curtain, and being it is the principal strength of a place, and better furnished with Platforms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lanks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will require more time, labour, and charge to batter, than your Curtain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="83" REF="50"/>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what General is so ill experienced, as to labour to batter a Curtain, having two strong Bulwarks on both sides of him, to flanker him when he is to put over his Gallery, and to give an assault upon the Curtain: peradventure for his labour and pains, he may be well beaten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soft (Good Sir,) Suppose that after a great deal of labour and pains you have battered a Bulwark, and falling up to the breach to assault it, you find it cut off, an Enemy lodged in it, must you not then begin to sap forward again, to make a new batte∣ry? whereas on a Curtain there is not that means of cutting it off, as upon a large Bulwark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you ever seen the experience of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes Sir, the Prince of</HI> Orange <HI>took in the</HI> Bosch <HI>by a Bulwark, and also</HI> Breda, <HI>but</HI> Mastrick <HI>was taken in by making a breach, and springing of a mine, upon the Curtain between</HI> Jonger <HI>Port and a Bulwark;</HI> howsoever the Town of <HI>Cortes</HI> upon the frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> was first battered by the <HI>Arch-duke of Austria</HI> upon the point of a Bulwark, near unto the very joynt of the Curtain, where a high and a strong turret stood, which did annoy us much, so that we could not advance forward, but were constrained to leave off our approach on that side, and began to make a new Battery for a breach in a Curtain on the Field-side, where there lay a strong Bulwark to defend it, which did our men a great deal of harm; but howsoever, with great difficulty and much ado, we took in the Town that way, by lodging our selves in the Curtain. Likewise the City of <HI>Cambray</HI> was battered, and taken in upon a Curtain, for all there were two strong Bulwarks that flankered it, which if we had run our line upon a Bulwark, we should not have forced it so soon; yea such an occasion might present it self, that a Ge∣neral may be forced to batter both the one and the other, or to find out some secret way by undermining a wall, and blowing it up with powder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is for your great Towns; but what say you to a Castle, a Cittadel, or some narrow Fortress, how will you go to work to take in those with the best ad∣vantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for your Forts, and Castles, it is much better to batter them upon a mount or a Bulwark, than upon a Curtain: my reason is this, that in these your Bulwarks lying close one by another, will flank one another with the greater force, and hide the Curtain much better to defend it, so that one cannot so easily force it, if the said de∣fenses be not taken away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go to then; a Town then being to be battered, either upon a Curtain or a Bulwark, how many Pieces of Ordnance would you have to do it, and, how and in what manner would you place, and plant your Ordnance upon your batteries to make a good breach?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>To effect this, I would have 18 Pieces of Canon and half Canon, <HI>(for lesser Pieces for Battery are now grown out of use.)</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether would you choose more whole Canon or half Canon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>To batter a place well either upon a stony or earthy wall, you may assure your self, the more whole Cannon you have, the greater and the more sufficient your breach will be: for your great battering Pieces do spoil and beat down any thing, which doth meet with their great force and violence: <HI>Howsoever of late years expe∣rience hath taught at divers Seiges that your half Canon which are more portable, having good store of them, will do the business aswell as your whole Canon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But at what distance would you make your Batteries, for these 18 Pieces of Canon, and how near unto the place, which you intend to Batter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would counsel a General to approach as near unto that place as possible may be, and make his Batteries some two or three hundred paces one from another, and that if it were possible to advance covertly the Approach and sap, even up to the Counter-scharfe, and very brink of the Moat, to prepare a way for his Gallery: not only to Batter that place being at hand with the greater force, but also to keep in, and hinder an Enemy from Sallying out upon the Besiegers, to discover and dismount their Ordnance in <HI>Casemates,</HI> or if they have sunk any in their Walls or False-bray, and so to terrifie them, that they dare not stir out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="84" REF="51"/>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am also of your opinion, and hold it for good, yet I fear this will not be so soon done, and is sooner spoken, than executed, and that before you can bring your approach and sap so far, it will cost you warm blood, and a great many mens lives, if you have a stout Enemy within to deal withal, and one that is very Vigilant, and careful to stand upon his Guard, and his defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, this cannot be done without danger, and the loss of men, but he that is fearful must stay at home, and not come into the Wars where there is neither place nor time, which doth free or exempt him from danger: yet the danger is not alwayes so great, especially in such places, where you have Earth enough to work with, to cast up your sapps, and to heighten and deepen your Approaches, which will show you the way, for the more higher you find the ground in Approaching to the edge of the moat, the deeper Trenches you may make, and cover your self by casting up of blinds continually, to keep you from the sight of the Besieged; and it is better, when you have brought your approach as it were under them, than if you were 200 or 300 paces distant from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you Good Sir, how would you plant, and divide these 18 Pieces of Canon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would make a great Battery with 8 of them to beat upon a right line, either upon a Curtain, or the point of a Bulwark (which the General shall find fittest) Two Batteries with each 3 Canon to play slope-wise from the great Battery; as the ninth plate and 28 and 29 figures shows, and two Batteries, with two half Canon a Piece, to play as it were cross-wise upon the breach. And thus you see your 18 Pieces planted upon 5 Batteries, as you may observe in the 9th. Plate, and the two Figures of a Curtain and of a Bulwark following.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Sir tell me I pray you how many shot will these 18 Pieces of Canon make in 10 hours, and how much powder will they require.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>In 10 hours they may make some 1500 shot, and will require a matter of 25000 pound weight of powder, that is 150 barrels full, each barrel containing 160 pound weight in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make your account then that every Piece in the space of 10 hours is to shoot 80 shot, that is 8 shot an hour for every Piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may make 10 shot in an hour if you please, if your Pieces be renforced; but as for your ordinary Pieces, they have not metalline substance enough to bear it: considering also that after you have made 40 shot out of a Piece, it will be so heated, that it must have a cooling time, which must be at least an hour, for otherwise your Piece being grown over hot, it may cause danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks that 80 shot for a Piece in so long a time were too little, having often heard, that in that while, a Piece may well be shot off 130 times; can you give me your resolution upon this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you Sir what hapned once in the Island of <HI>Bomble,</HI> Anno 1599. we planted a Piece by a mill, by which we did annoy the Enemy very much, so that they were forced to make a Battery, and planted a whole Canon, and a demy-Canon upon it, seeking to dismount ours. Now shooting with this Piece from four of the clock in the morning, till eleven toward noon, this Piece had a cooling time the space of two hours, and about one of the clock we began to play with it again, and continued shooting with it till 4 a clock in the afternoon; but this Piece being not able to endure the force and heating of so many shot, we were constrained to leave off with it: and yet ceased not shooting with our other Pieces from another Battery by command from <HI>Don Lewes de Valasco,</HI> General of our Ordnance, and shooting cross-wise with some other of our Pieces, we put the Enemies two Pieces to silence in the space of an hour; a Souldier of ours standing by, was curious to keep a tally of the number of all the shot we made from the morning till four a clock in the afternoon, and shewed me 80 notches, which deducting the two hours cooling, our Piece planted at the Mill made 8 shot in an hour, which was as much as could be required of it.</P>
</SP>
<Q>Senior <HI>Diego Uffano</HI>give your Translator leave to interrupt you a little, and so to conclude this discourse. If you remember at the Seige of <HI>Ostend,</HI> which you mention ofttn
<PB N="85" REF="51"/> in your Chapters and Dialogues, you were without, and I was within the Town, that on the seventh of <HI>January, Anno 1602. Stilo Novo,</HI> After Sir <HI>Francis Vere</HI> of famous memory (who defended and kept the Town against you) had deluded you with a <HI>Parley,</HI> only to gain time, and to make up our Canon and Sea-beaten works along the skirt of the old Town, his Highness the Archduke resolved to assault us, and that morning began to batter <HI>Sand-hill</HI> and <HI>Schotenburgh,</HI> to make a breach for you against that night, with intent to Assault us (as you did) and to have entred the Town, and have put us all to the Sword, the Relation whereof you shall hear in the end of this Book. Now you had placed and planted your 20 Pieces of Cannon to batter them in this manner, 8 from your Battery at the foot of the <HI>Downs, 8</HI> from a Battery on the right hand of the <HI>Downs,</HI> 6 from your pile Battery, 6 more which you had made upon the Sand, and as it were raised out of the Sea: the first shot upon the breach in a right line, and the other two slope∣wise, as your two figures following do demonstrate. These 20 Pieces of Canon towards noon had a cooling time, for a matter of some 2 hours, just as you have said; and afterwards you began to batter the breach and old Town again, till it was almost twilight, and then they cooled again, till you were ready to give us an assault; and before you fell on, as I do well remember, you shot off one of your Cannons with a hollow Bullet, which flew over the Town and made a great humming noise, as a warning Piece to the <HI>Count of Bucquoy,</HI> who lay on the East-side, that you were then ready to fall on, and that he should do the like, this was your Signal. Now <HI>General Vere</HI> knowing well your intent, gave order to the Gentleman of our Ordnance who had the guard upon <HI>Sand-hill,</HI> that he should keep a true Tally, and an account of all the shot you made that day, with your 20 Pieces of Cannon upon the breach and the old Town, which being cast up, there were found to be made that day from morning till night 2200 shot, which was found to be an 110 shot for every Piece, and 11 shot an hour for every Piece, which is more than 8; but I verily believe your Pieces were renforced. <HI>This by the way, and so I return again to your own Dialogue.</HI></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Good Sir) I pray show me how you would batter the point of a Bulwark (as the figure 28 following demonstrates,) and give me some reasons aswel defensive as offensive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing to give your Lordship content, and say, If I were to batter the point of a <HI>Bulwark</HI> or a <HI>Bastion,</HI> I would have the same number of battering Canon, and planted in the same form and manner as they were for the Curtain, and to shoot sloap and cross-wise also; and if your approaches were advanced so far, they should be planted upon the very brink of the moat and upon the <HI>Counterscharfe,</HI> I would plant 4 of them so, that they should dismount the Enemies Canon in their <HI>Casemates,</HI> or any, if they had sunk them in their <HI>Falsebray,</HI> which should wait upon that occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of your mind, and prefer such a battery before all others, who are of the opinion that they had rather choose a Curtain than a Bulwark to be battered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have heard my reasons for that, and see the figures following traced out to you. But as for your <HI>Bulwark</HI> the <HI>besieged</HI> may cut it off (as you may mark in the figures of <HI>Retrenchments</HI> and <HI>Cuttings off</HI> in the second part of this book) for indeed it will be a hard matter to force an Enemy out of a Bulwark, who is resolved to loose it by peecemeal and degrees; and there is not so much danger in assaulting of a Curtain, which being once well battered and beaten down with your Ordnance, you have an easier way and entrance to fall on with your Troops of men, to enter the Town or Fortress; but for the defence which is made from your Flanking Bul∣warks, or your Casemates, you must make Batteries upon the brink of the moat against them, (as is said) to dismount the Enemies Pieces, and to flanker with your Ordnance the Parapets of the Bulworks to beat them about their ears, that the Bul∣works may lye the more open to you, and I think this way is the least danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Besieged, their cuttings off, may they not be made aswel upon a Cur∣tain as upon a Bulwark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, for the Rampire being thinner, you have neither so much ground, nor the like accommodation in a Curtain as in a Bulwark; and indeed, a Governour
<PB N="86" REF="52"/> of a Town, or of a Fortress, if he were put to his choice, had rather to be assaulted on a Bulwark (than on a Curtain) by cutting it off into the form of a half moon, that he might make a new resistance, and defend it with a less number of men. Besides, in a Bulwark the Besieged have this advantage over the Assailants, which is very dangerous for them, that they may make a Mine within the bowels of their Bulwark when an Enemy shall attempt to assault it, and thinking to enter the Breach and take the Town, they may be blown up into the Air by a Countermine; the like also may happen to the Besieged, the Assailants springing their Mine also in a Bulwark, when they think they stand upon their best defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>May not the like be done also in a Curtain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it will not take the like effect as in a Bulwark; for a Breach being once made in a Curtain, for as an Enemy may assault it at large, so they may bring a greater number of men to fight, to help to defend it; whereas in a Bulwark they are pen'd up and straightned in a narrow place, which may be cut off, and will require a fewer number of men to defend it, whereas those which are to force it, must be constrained to bring up a great many men to assault, who in an instant may be in danger of blowing up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reasons (Good Captain) are not to be slighted; but as for me, I hold it safer, to batter and assault the breach of a Bulwark, than of a Curtain. For though the besieged may cut it off, and defend it with a fewer number of men, yet the Assaulters have this advantae over the Besieged defendants, that they have more place and elbow room, and may find a less resistance than in a Curtain, seeing that one may make as a great a breach in a Bulwark as in a Curtain, because your Ordnance may beat it flat, and level with the ground; and choosing rather a Bulwark: I will herewith conclude this discourse, and now shew you the figures both of the one, and of the other in this following plate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing the demonstration of Morters, and the use of them.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOur great and small Morters, are not only serviceable in a War offensive, by shooting and casting of great Granadoes, as of 100, 150, 170 pound weight, and smaller of 40, and 50 pound; but also by casting of Fire-balls, Stones, old Rubbidge, and Pieces of Iron, into Cities, Towns, and Fortresses; and may be used also defensively, to be shot from Towns and Forts into any Enemies works, and approaches; especially they are of singular use, when an Enemy hath covertly ap∣proached, and lodged himself under some Bulwark, Tower, or Turret, and is a be∣ginning to undermine them; which if they do, you may plant one of these Morters at a reasonable distance, on the inside of your Wall, and shooting your Granado, as it were bolt upright into the air, by its natural fall, it may light just into the Ene∣mies works, and there with great violence breaking among them, it will make them cry, fly, and forsake the place; you may also fire them out of a place, by casting good store of Hand Granadoes down among them, and so annoy them, that the work will be too hot for them.</P>
<P>Two of these Morters are represented unto you, in the Plate and Figures follow∣ing number. Now for the shooting a way of your great Granadoes or Fireballs, you must ever remember, but to take ⅕ or 1/7 parts of fine Powder of the weight of your
<PB REF="53"/>
<PB N="87" REF="53"/> Granado or thing which you shoot; but if you are to shoot away a Bullet without any Fire-works in it, or some massie stone, or such like solid thing, then you must take but half the weight of it in fine Powder, which, having given fire to the Morter, will send it going merrily.</P>
<P>The use of them is not to shoot in a right line, as other Ordnance do, but in an oblique line, as you may see by the two Figures following, unless your Morter be mounted to 90 degrees, mounting them usually above 45 degrees, namely to 60, 70, 80, and sometimes more or less, as the distance and fall of your Granado or Shot shall require.</P>
<P>Having before shown you the making and use of the Quadrant, it remains now that I come to the charging and use of a Morter; now before you put in your Pow∣der. it must be well sponged and cleared, whether you charge it with loose Powder, or Cartouch, turning the mouth almost bolt upright; the Powder being put into the Chamber, you must stop it with a Wadd either of Hay or Oakam, and after a Tampkin of some soft wood, and this with the Powder that was put in first, it must fill up the whole Chamber thereof, that there may be no vacuity between the Powder and the Wadd, or between the Wadd and the Shot; this done, the shot shall be put in at the mouth, with another Wadd after it; but you must have a care that your Morter be not much mounted, lest your shot flyes out too soon, and the Wadd between the Tampkin and the shot will not only save the shot from the Tampkins breaking of it, but also is to avoid vacuities which may endanger the breaking of the Piece by second expansions.</P>
<P>Now then having resolved of the premisses, touching your Piece, Shot, and Powder, as abovesaid, and upon the distance and mounture of your mark, as the Rules and Tables following shall direct you, then for the bending and disposing of it to the assigned mark; lay first a straight Ruler upon the Mouth of your Morter, and upon it place a Quadrant (as you may see by the Figures) or some other Instrument cross-wise, to set the Morter upright, for shuning of wide shooting, and then placing them fore-right to elevate it into the resolved degree of Mounture, to avoid short or overshooting, accordingly as the Tables following will teach you; for having made one shot, you may thereby proportion the rest, considering whether you are to shoot with or against the wind, or whether it blows towards the right or the left hand, whether weakly or strongly, and so accordingly to give or abate the advan∣tage, or disadvantage, which judgment and discretion will induce you thereunto, and the help of the Rules following.</P>
<P>Now we will come to the use of a Morter, and that in this example following; Suppose an Enemy be approached to the <HI>Basis,</HI> or foot of a Wall or a Bulwark, and there is a rooting, and begins to make a Mine, and having Chambred his Powder, intends to blow it up, and that there is no other means left you, to repulse and hinder their egress and regress into it; but by shooting out of your Morters some Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Stones, and Rubbish among them, or at least by casting many Hand-Granadoes down upon them. To do this either by force or policy, it behoveth a good Canonier or Fire-worker, to know first (as hath been taught) how far his Morter will carry a Granado, or any solid thing else, which shall be shot out of it, being set upon such and such a degree and elevation as the Morter Figure will shew you. As for Example, take your aim level with the mould or mouth of your Morter, noted A upon the Quadrant, and it will carry 200 paces, where you see the Granado falls upon the letter A; but your morter being elevated to the mark B, it then will carry its Bullet 487 paces; if to the second C, then 755 paces; if to the third D, it will carry 937 paces; if to the fourth E, then 1065 paces; if to the fifth elevation F, then 1132 paces; if to the sixth G, which is in the midst of the Quadrant, and lyes then upon its highest elevation, it will carry 1170 paces, as you may see by the several falls of the Bullets upon every Letter. The second Figure shews you a Morter casting a Granado upon a Castle, as you may see by the Example.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He number of artificial Fire-works which are practised as well in Armies upon Land in the attacquing and defence of places, as in defence of Ships at Sea, whereby warlike Executions may be performed, are many and various, according to the ingenuity of the Fire-Master: And the wayes of preparing them are so many, as it is impossible for us in this room we have allotted to prescribe all that are known. We shall therefore be contented to make choice of some of the best and principal things among so great a number, but more particularly of some most admirable inventions; and we shall give a Chapter to every kind of Fire-work, considering they differ among themselves both in fashi∣on and effect, and every one hath its name which is particularly applyed to it. But before we begin with our composition we shall begin with the particulars, and their preparation unto this work, whereby they may be the more exalted, and have the grea∣ter efficacy. The more principal materials, that is, Peter, Charcoal and Sulphur, are mentioned at large in my first part of Gunnery, and therefore we shall proceed.</P>

<HEAD>To prepare Oyl of Sulphur.</HEAD>
<P>TAke a good quantity of clarified Sulphur, (the way of Clarification we have shewed before) melt it over a very gentle fire in an Earthen or Copper Vessel, then take old red Tyles that have been already used in buildings, or if you cannot find such, take new Tyles that are well baked, and that have not taken dirt, break them in pieces as small as a Bean, and throw them into melted Brimstone, then min∣gle your Brimstone with the remaining fragments of the Bricks, until they have drank up all the Sulphur, then let them be put into a Limbeck upon a Furnace to distil, and after the Oyl is drawn according to a Chymical order it will be very excellent, and aboveall, have a very combustible quality, proper to the Compositions of artificial fires.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To prepare Oyl or Balsam of Sulphur.</HEAD>
<P>Fill a long body of Glassfull of Sulphur well powdered, then pour upon it Oyl of Turpentine, or Oyl of nuts, or Juniper, in such a quantity that the oyl with the Sulphur may fill but the half part, place it in an Iron Kettle; with Sand round about it, and a small heat for 8 or 9 hours, and you will see that the Oyl of Tur∣pentine will convert the Brimstone into a red Oyl, as fiery and combustible as before.</P>
<P>There are those that take the following matter to the preparing the oyl of Sulphur, to the end it may be rendered more combustible, <HI>viz.</HI> Sulphur 1 <HI>l.</HI> of quick Lyme half a pound, of Sal-armoniac 4 ounces.</P>
<P>Above all this, the Chymists know how to prepare a certain oyl of Sulphur, (which they call a Balsam) of which the virtues are so admirable, that they admit not any body, either living or dead, to be touched with putrification, but will conserve it in so perfect and entire state, that neither the pernicious Influences of the celestial bodies, nor that corruption which the Elements produce, nor that which reduces things into their Principles, can any way damnifie it, if anoynted with it. There is also from it prepared a certain fire (as <HI>Tritemius</HI> teacheth) with flowers of <HI>Sulphur, Borax</HI> and <HI>Brandy-wine,</HI> which will remain many years without extinguishing of it self. Others that are knowing, do attest that a Lamp may be filled with such like Oyl, from whence all that are within the Light of it, will appear as if they had no heads.</P>
<P>There is another way of making Oyl of Sulphur which is very admirable and ex∣cellent, which is prepared thus. Incorporate well together an equal proportion of Sulphur and Salt-Peter, reduce them into most subtile Powder, and pass it through a fine sieve, then put them into an Earthen Pot that hath never been used, and pour upon them Vinegar made of <HI>White-wine</HI> or <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> as much as will cover the Pow∣der; Close the Pot in such manner that no air may any wise enter, and put it thus in any hot place so long time until all the vinegar be digested and vanished. Lastly, take that matter which rests in the Pot, and draw from thence an oyl, by Chymical Instru∣ments proper to this work.</P>

<P><HI>The preparation of the Flowers of Benjamin.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TAke Benjamin a certain quantity of ounces, put it into a Gourd or a Limbeck glass, and close it well with a blind head (as they call it) then have in readi∣ness an earthen vessel, set it upon a Tresfoot, or for the more certainty upon a small Furnace, place it in your glass body, and compass it well about with fine Sand or a∣shes so high as the matter is in the glass; after make a moderate fire under it, for fear the Limbeck heat too soon, and be too hot, for that will make the flowers become citrine or yellow, when they ought to be as white as Snow. Observe when you see the flowers begin to raise a vapour or small fume, continue your fire in that same de∣gree the space of one quarter of an hour; after you shall see the flowers risen unto the internal Superficies of the blind head, then take it away carefully, and put to it another that shall be quite cold, and put that which you have taken off upon a white paper until it be cold, then gently with a Feather or wooden Spatula, cause the flow∣ers to come forth of the blind head, and gather them together carefully: thus you may add a third or fourth blind head, and in time many, until all the Benjamin cease to fume.</P>
<P>Benjamin may be made into flowers another way, thus; put into a glazed pot a certain quantity of ounces of Benjamin, and place it upon warm ashes, and when you see it begin to fume, cover the vessel with a Cornet of paper made in the form of a Cone, and a little larger than the orifice of the pot, leave it there about one quar∣ter of an hour, after take off the Cornet, and take the flowers and gather them to∣gether; then put upon the vessel another Cornet of paper, and let it stand as long as before; take it off, and gather the flowers to the former, and continue thus putting Cornet after Cornet, until your flowers be entirely evaporated.</P>

<P><HI>The preparation of Camphire.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TAke Juniper Gumm (which is called somtimes) Sandarach, white varnish, or Mastick most subtilly powdered 2 <HI>l.</HI> white distilled vinegar as much as is necessa∣ry to cover the Gumm in a glass, set it deep in horse-dung the space of 20 days; then take it and pour it forth into another glass Vessel with a wide mouth, and let it stand thus in digestion a whole moneth, and in it you shall have Camphire congealed in form of a Crust of bread, and which hath in some measure the resemblance of the ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣ble or true Camphire. The Camphire hath such a love for the fire, that being once lighted, it goeth not out until it be quite consumed. The flame that comes from thence is very clear, and of a very agreeable odour; after it hath remained suspen∣ded in the air some time it vanisheth insensibly. The cause that produceth all these rare effects from Camphire, is by reason its parts are extream subtil and airy.</P>
<P>I do add to all this, that it may be easie to reduce Camphire into Powder, to make it useful in artificial fireworks, if a man crumbles it and beats it gently, rouling it with Sulphur. The oyl of Camphire, which serves also for the same effect, is made by ad∣ding a little of oyl of sweet Almonds, and stir them well together in a brass Morter, and pestle of the same metal, until all be converted into oyl of a greenish colour.</P>

<P>Or a man may put it into a Glass Viol which must be close stopped, provided also that the Camphire be true and natural, and not a Cheat; then put that Glass into a warm Furnace, and draw it out, when you shall see all the Camphire turned into a pure clear oyl, which will burn with an admirable vivacity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Hand Granadoes.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Hand Granadoes respecting their form, are Globically or perfectly round and hollow in their interior part in manner of a Sphere; they are called Hand Granadoes, or Handy Granadoes, because they may be grasped in the hand, and thrown to the Enemies; and if we should dwell upon the denominations of the Latine, we may call them as they do, <HI>Granades Palmares,</HI> they are commonly of the bigness of a Bullet of Iron of 5, 6, and 8 <HI>l.</HI> they weigh sometimes 1 <HI>l.</HI> and sometimes one pound and a half, some are of two pounds, and others of three pounds; there is given to these sort of Globes the names of <HI>Granadoes,</HI> by reason of the great resemblance they have with the Fruit <HI>Punique,</HI> which we call <HI>Pom-granad;</HI> for as these do shut up in their rinds a great quantity of grains; so our Military Globes are filled with a number of Grains of Powder, almost innumerable, the which having received the Fire, do break into a thousand and a thousand shivers, leaping against the Enemy, and piercing if it could all such things as it meets opposing its violence. They are generally made of Iron or Copper, carrying in its Diameter about three Ounces, being about the length of a Barly Corn in thickness of Metal; they are filled commonly with Gun-Powder, and sometimes of other Compositions, there is added to its Orifice a small Pipe commonly called a Fuse, which is filled with a matter or Composition that is slack or slow in burn∣ing, but nevertheless very susceptible of the Fire, and capable to hold fire some time, for fear that it should break in the hands of those that mannage it, and intend to throw it.</P>
<P>There is amongst Fire-Masters accounted three sorts of Hand Granadoes, the first and most common are made of Iron; others are made of Brass, allayed with other Metals in the melting; the third sort is of Glass.</P>
<P>If you cause them to be made of Iron, take such as is most fragile, and as little wrought as possible you can get; if you will cast them of Copper, you must allay six pound of Copper, with two pounds of Tyn, and half a pound of Marcasite, or you may put one part of Tyn with three parts of Lattin or of <HI>Auricalque.</HI> Those that are made of Iron are in thickness about the ninth part of the Diameter; those that are made of Brass must have one tenth part of the Diameter in thickness of Metal. Lastly, such which you cause to be made of Glass, must have one seventh part of their Diameter in their thickness.</P>
<P>The largeness of the Orifice in which you must put in your Fuse made of Wood, whose upper part must be about 2/9 the Diameter of the Granado, and the small hole in the Fuse should have the largeness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the same Diameter, the rest of the ca∣pacity of the Shell must be filled with well grain'd Powder, the length of the Fuse must be about ⅔ of the Diameter, and the top must be broad, and a little rounding like a Hemisphere, the hollow and inner part of the Fuse must be about 1/9 Diameter at the small or inner end, and 2/9 at the outer end: Men do generally fill the void place with Powder ground most subtilly, which must be moistned with Gum-water, or dissolved glue, that it may joyn the better. As for the Fuses, they must be filled or char∣ged with one of the Compositions hereunder written; afterward you must fasten it well and close with Tow or Okham, and the Pyrotechnian Lute which the <HI>Germans</HI> call <HI>Kit,</HI> which is made of four parts of Ship Pitch, two parts of Colophonia, one part of Ter∣rebinthe, and one part of Wax; you must put all these Ingredients in a glazed Ves∣sel, and melt them upon a small fire, then mix and mingle them well together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How and where a man ought to heave Hand-Gra∣nadoes.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ACcording to the definition which we have given of them, it is most evident, and I suppose no body will doubt, that they are to be taken in the hand, and that we must grasp them to throw them at the Enemy. It is said before that this kind of Arms is as well defensive as offensive; therefore we shall not rest upon the proof of these things; those that have been at the managing of them must instruct them that are ignorant.</P>
<P>We shall say only this, that the Places where these Hand Granadoes are used at Sea, are where Ships are Board and Board to clear the Enemies Decks, so that the way may be cleared there. Upon Land Service they are used immediately after the good and happy success of a Mine which hath made a great overture in a Rampire, overthrowing one part of the Wall, Bulwark, or Bastion, to give place to the Assai∣lants, to do their endeavour to get into the breach; it is there that the Besieged as well as Besiegers may make use of these Hand Granadoes; 'tis there where you shall see the more generous of both sides armed with Fire and Flames, defending valiantly the quarrel of their Prince, the interest of their Party, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Liberties and their Lives. They are imployed also upon other occasions, to wit, when the Besiegers are come up to the Walls of the Rampire, and so well placed, that making winding Stairs in the thickness of the Platform, they mount insensibly by retact; so that the Besieged cannot any way hinder by the defence of their Flanks, nor be kept safe by the Rampires themselves. Upon these occasions I say, the Besieged ought to pour down a
<PB N="9" REF="62"/> a quantity of Hand Granadoes from aloft, or from the top of the Walls, upon their under-miners.</P>
<P>And sometimes they are also thrown at a distance greater than ordinary, according to the occasion; but when this cannot be done by the natural strength of a Soldier, without the aid of some artificial Instrument, the Masters in this Art have invented certain small Engines, made like unto one of our Ducking-Stools, with a Rope at one end to pluck it down by force, and at the other end a hollow place to lay the Balls in that are to be thrown, and with this Engine well contrived, one may throw upon the Enemy, not only Hand Granadoes; but also a quantity of other Artificial Mili∣tary Fires, as glistring or shining Globes, Bombards, Fire-pots, and many other such like things, of which we shall speak in their place, may be thrown at a greater distance than is possible by the hand only.</P>
<P>This Instrument is not very difficult to make, it may easily be comprehended by what we have said. I shall only advertise you of one thing, that the longer the arm of the Engine is on that side that is to hold the Granadoes, more than the other part to which the Rope is fastned, the greater force the Engine will have; but you must understand this measure to be made from Axes or Iron Rolls, upon which the Arm moves.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Shooting of Shot made red hot in the Fire.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is practice that hath been practised in former times to shoot red hot Fire-balls, and was counted of great defence, as you may find amongst many other things in the Works of <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> where he sayes, <HI>Tyrios immisse in Alexandri Magni machinamenta massas ferreas candentes:</HI> Out of many Authors may be proved the customary use in former times of Shooting red hot Pieces of Iron., which we shall not dwell upon, but come to the Practice. First, you must Charge the Piece of Ordnance according to the customary manner, his due proportion of Powder, upon this Powder you must put a Wooden Cylender or Fidd, of a just and equal wideness with the bore of the Piece, which must be driven very stiff home to the Powder, and for your better security, you must put upon this another wad made of Straw, Hay, or of Oakam, or Tow; this being done, let the Piece be laid a little under Metal, and then cleanse the vacant place or hollow of the Piece with a Spunge, so that all the Grains of Powder that are there, may be taken away. This being done, lay your Piece to bear with the place you intend to shoot at, according to the method we have given in the second Part of Gunnery, and let your Piece thus remain until you have put in your red hot Bullet: your Bullet must be sure to be exactly round, and not so high, but that it may run freely down in the Piece to the wad, the Shot being red hot, take it out of the fire with a pair of Tongs made for that purpose, and put it into the Piece, and give an attentive Ear, for as soon as the Shot is supposed to be up to the Wad, give immediately Fire to your Piece of Ordnance.</P>
<P>There are others which put into their Pieces Boxes made of Plate, of Iron or Cop∣per. Others do put into their Pieces Potters Clay, and upon them the fiery Bullet, which with a quick hand they thrust home with a Rammer, which ought to be defend∣ed from fire by lining the Rammer head with Copper. But these are more perillous; and therefore we account that method above to be the best, and most free from danger.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How to make Rockets.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Intend not here to write the Construction of Moulds fit for this purpose, but ra∣ther leave the more curious Students herein to the works of <HI>Casimier Siemieno∣wicz,</HI> Lieutenant General of the Artillery in the Kingdome of <HI>Polonia,</HI> in his great Art of Artillery written in the French Tongue and Printed at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and also in our Countrey-men Mr. <HI>Bate</HI> and Mr. <HI>Babington</HI> &amp;c. That which I intend to do, is to teach you how they may be made by hand, or by help only of a Rouler to Roul the Paper upon; let it be turned to the thickness you intend, only let the Rouler be 8 times the Diameter in length. If it be three quarters of an inch in thickness, the length will be three inches. Roul your Paper hard on the Rouler until the thickness be one inch and a quarter Rouler and all; then glue the uppermost paper, and the Case is made. On the choaking or contracting the paper together at one end, within one Diameter of the end, except only a little hole, about one quarter the Diameter of the bore thereof, to contract these Cases on this manner, do thus, wet the end about one inch in water, then put the Rouler in again, and tye a great packthread about the wet within three quarters of an inch of the end, put another thing almost of the same Diameter with the Rouler in at the wet end about half an inch, hold it there, get some
<PB N="15" REF="65"/> other body to draw the packthread together, you holding the Rouler and Rammer, one put down to the end within one inch, and the Rammer which must be little less than the Diameter to meet with that end within half an inch, in which the contract or choaking must be; the packthread having drawn it together, tye it fast on that place, take out the Former, let it dry, and it is done; when the hole is contracted together, make it so wide as is before taught, with a round bodkin, which you must provide for that purpose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the many defects in Fuzees, how they may be avoided, and of such things as ought to be observed in their good Construction.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe first and most notable defect which is observed in Fuzees, is that after they are lighted or risen into the Air the height of 1, 2, or 3 Perches, they break, and do dissipate without making their entire effects.</P>
<P>The second, which is little better, is after it is remaining suspended upon the nail it consumes but very leisurely, without going away or raising it self in the Air.</P>
<P>The third is, when they are raised in the Air, they describe only an Arch of a Circle like a Rainbow, and return upon the earth again before the Composition in the Fuzee be consumed.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="69"/>
<P>The fourth is when it moves in a spiral manner, whirling in the Air without ob∣serving an equal motion; that is not right as it ought to be.</P>
<P>The fifth is when it mounts sloathfully and negligently, as if it disdained or refused to elevate it self into the Air.</P>
<P>The sixth and last is, that the Case or Cartouch remains hanging upon the Nail quite empty, and the Composition doth rise and dissipate alone into the Air. There is many other vexations and inconveniencies which may give trouble to the Practitioners in these Arts with vain expence, which would loose too much time to repeat: It will be sufficient if you take notice of these which are principal, whereby, if by ill fortune you be faln into any of these defaults, you may correct your error easily, and then immediately correct those faults. And for this purpose, observe the rules given in the next Chapter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Infallible Rules by which you may make Fuzees, or Rockets, without any default.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FIrst, that they have their height proportionable to the Diameter of their Orifice, as we have before declared.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Cartouch ought to be of wood, or glued or pasted paper, not too thick, nor too thin.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they ought to be made of strong paper of indifferent dryness, properly rouled and well compacted close upon the Former.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the necks ought to be bound about very strongly and firm, in such a sort, that the knot of the thred, and the folds of the Cartouch, may not lye amiss one upon the other.</P>
<P>Fifthly, all the Materials of the Composition must be exactly weighed according to the proportion of the Orifice of the Fuzee that you would charge, and also well beaten and sifted particularly; after, having weighed them again, and mixed them in one body well together, you must pound them again, and pass them through the Sieve as you did before.</P>
<P>Sixthly, that the Salt-Peter and Sulphur be powdered and clarified as much as possible may be, and the Coal perfectly well burned and exempted from all humidity, and made of wood that is light and soft, as the Teile, the Hazle, and the branches of the Willow Tree; and on the contrary, 'tis necessary to have a care, that you make not use of such Coals as are made of Birch, Oak, nor Maple, because they contain in them much weighty and terrestial matter.</P>
<P>Seventhly, matters for Rockets or Fuzees ought to be prepared immediately before they are intended for use, and not before.</P>
<P>Eighthly, the matters of Composition ought to be neither too dry nor too moist, but moistned a little with some Oliganious matter, or with a little Brandywine.</P>
<P>Ninthly, there must be put into the Cartouch alwayes an equal quantity of the Composition at a time, and so beat it down alike; and thus do until it be filled.</P>
<P>Tenthly, you must beat the Composition alwayes with the Rammer right up, or perpendicularly, and take care that in the beating it be not made crooked.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, You must strike down the Composition with a wooden Mallet, that is of heft proportionable to the bigness and thickness of the Rocket, and alwayes with an equal strength, and just number of stroaks, every time you put in any of the Com∣position.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="70"/>
<P>Twelfthly, in Cartouches made of paper, you must put in round peeces of wood hollowed; but in those that are made of wood, you must put such as are smooth, without any channel or hollowing, to the end that it joyn the better to the sides of the Fuzee, where it must joyn firmly, as well without as within.</P>
<P>13. The Fuzee must be peirced with a Bit or Awl that is convenient, in such a sort that the hole be not too big nor too straight, nor too long nor too short.</P>
<P>14. The hole must be made the most streight and perpendicular that may be possible, and just in the middle of the Composition, to the end that it lean nor to any one side, more than to the other.</P>
<P>15. The Fuzee must not be peirced before it be intended for use, and after it is pierced you must handle it tenderly, only with the ends of your fingers, for fear of deforming it.</P>
<P>16. The Pearch or Stick to which you fasten the Fuzee, ought to be proportio∣nable as well in length as weight; it must not be crooked nor winding in any manner, neither unequal, nor full of knots, but streight as possible can be made, and must therefore be made smooth, and streightned with a Plain, if need requires.</P>
<P>17. After they are Charged, they must not be laid into too dry a place, nor in a place too moist, for the one or other of those accidents may hurt them; therefore let the place be temperate.</P>
<P>18. When you would use them and put them into action, hang them upon a nail perpendicular to the Horizon.</P>
<P>19. You must not think to raise a bundle of a great weight, or that has too great a disproportion to their strength, you must adjoyn them together so rightly, that all together may have a proper form, and reasonable to pass into the Air, and to elevate it self on high without any difficulty, and in such a sort, that those bundles may not by any means give hinderance or stoppage to their rising in a streight line; and take care most exactly that the Fuzee be not so big, but that they may retain as near as you can a Pyramidal or Conical form, when all its weight that may be is adjoyned to it.</P>
<P>20. Men ought to shun as much as possible those nights that are rainy, moist, and when the Sky is darkned with black clouds, as being very incommodious and offen∣sive to the Fuzees. And more than that, avoid impetuous Stormy winds, and the Whirl-winds hinder no less than the first.</P>
<P>21. You may not reject above other causes, the different effects which are pro∣duced by sundry Fuzees (although they be charged with one and the same Compo∣sition) no otherwise than thus, that they were not made with an equal diligence either in the Charging or Peircing, or in the other Circumstances, which you were obliged to observe; or in this, that it may be some may have been kept in a more moister place than the others, where they have acquired too much moisture, which causeth to them, effects much different one from another, as well in Rising as in Consuming.</P>
<P>22. If you would make appear in the Air streams of fire, or a quantity of burning sparks or stars, or long large rayes to dart from the Fuzees; there is ac∣customed to mix with the Composition some small quantity of powdered Glass grosly beaten, filings of Iron, Sawdust. One may also represent fire of divers colours, as we have shewed before in the fifth Chapter; but more particularly thus; if you put a certain portion of Camphire in your Composition, you will see in the Air a certain fire which will appear, white, pale, and of the colour of Milk; if you put Greek Pitch, which is a light yellow Pitch used in Plaisters, called <HI>Pix Burgundy,</HI> it will represent unto you a red flame, and of the colour of Brass; if you put in Sulphur, the fire will appear blew; if Sal-Armoniack, the fire will appear Greenish; if from Crude Antimony, the flame will be Red, Yellowish, and of the Colour of Honey; if the filings of Ivory be added, they will render a Silver-like, White and shining flame, yet something inclining to a Livid Plumbous colour; if the powder of Yellow Amber be added, the fire will appear of the same colour, with the Citrine; lastly, if black Pitch be added, it will throw forth an obscure smoaky fire, or rather a smoak that is black and thick, which will darken all the Air.</P>

<P>FIrst, take Salt-Peter reduced into fine meal 16 <HI>l.</HI> Sulphur 4 <HI>l.</HI> of the sawings of wood which hath been first boyled in a Nitrous water, and afterwards well dryed, 4 <HI>l.</HI> Of good Corned powder half a pound, of the powder of Ivory 4 ounces. Or thus,</P>

For that which concerns the manner of preparing all these Compositi∣ons; it differs nothing from what we have prescribed in the making of Rockets, only 'tis not necessary that the materials be so subtilly beaten, powdered nor sifted, as for those <HI>Fuzees,</HI> but nevertheless to be well mixed one among another. Care must be taken that they be not too dry when you charge the Globes or Balls, and for that purpose they may be moistned with Linseed-oyl, Oyl of Olives, Petrole, Hemp∣seed, Nuts, or any other fatty humour that is receptible of fire.</P>
<P>Note,. that amongst all these Compositions of matters that will burn in the water, which I have here proposed from my own particular experience, every one may make them as pleaseth himself best, provided he always take the materials in propor∣tion

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of Stars and fiery Sparks, called by the</HI> Germans Stern-veuer <HI>and</HI> Veuerputzen.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have shewed the Composition of Stars in Chap. 5. I have also shewed the way of making them up, and their use, and also I have shewed the manner of giving to them various Colours, as in the 22 Rule of the 13 Chapter, where I had an intent to say no more of these things: But finding in Master <HI>Cazimier</HI>'s Artillery these Compositions, which I judge may prove very excellent; therefore I thought good to insert them, that I might leave out nothing that might make more perfect any thing we treat of.</P>
<P>First, you must know that between fiery Sparks and Stars there is this diffe∣rence, that the Stars are greater, and are not so soon consumed by the fire as the Sparks are, but do subsist longer in the Air; and do shine with greater substance, and with such a light, that by reason of their great splendor, they are in some manner comparable with the Stars in the Heavens. They are prepared according to the fol∣lowing Method.</P>
<P>Take Salt-Peter half a pound, Sulphur two ounces, Yellow Amber powdered one Dram, Antimony Crude one Dram, of beaten Powder three Drams. Or,</P>
<P>Take Sulphur two ounces and a half, Salt-Peter four ounces, Powder subtilly powdered four ounces, Olibanum, Mastick, Christal, Mercury sublimate, of each four ounces, White Amber one ounce, Camphire one ounce, Antimony and Orpi∣ment half an ounce; All these materials being well beaten and well sifted, they must be mixt together with a little Glue or Gum-water, made with Gum-Arabick or Tragacant; then make them into small Balls about the bigness of a Bean or small Nut, which being dryed in the Sun, or in a Pan by the fire, may be kept in a convenient place for such uses as we have spoken of in the fifth Chapter of this Book. You must only remember, that when you would put them into Rockets or Recreative Balls, they must be covered on all sides with prepared Tow, of which we have shewed the way of preparing in the seventh Chapter of the first Part of our Fire-works.</P>
<P>Sometimes Fire-Masters are accustomed to take in the places of these little Balls, a certain proportion of melted matters, of which we have spoken in the first Part of Fire-works; But if these do not please you, by reason of their swarthy colour, but you rather desire to see them yellow, or inclining somewhat to white, then take of Gum-Arabick or Tragacant four ounces, powder it and pass it through a Sieve, of Camphire dissolved in <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> two ounces, Salt-Peter a pound and a half, Sulphur half a pound, Glass grossy powdered four ounces, White Amber an ounce and a half, Orpiment two ounces, make all these Ingredients into one mass, and make Globes of them as before. I Learned this, saith my Author, from <HI>Claude Midorge.</HI></P>
<PB N="25" REF="71"/>
<P>For the method of making Sparkles in particular, it is thus; Take Salt-Peter one ounce, of this Liquid matter half an ounce, of beaten Powder half an ounce, of Camphire two ounces; after you have beaten all these materials into powder, every one by it self, put all of them into an Earthen Pan, and put upon them the Water of Gum Tragacanth, or Brandy-wine, wherein you have dissolved some Gum Tragacanth or Arabick, until it be of a good consistency; that done, take an ounce of Lint, which has first been boyled in Brandy-wine or Vinegar, or in Salt-Peter, and after dryed again, and the threads drawn out; then put it into the Composition, and mix them well together, so well and so long until it has drank up all the matter; of these Compositions make little Balls in the form of Pills, and of the bigness of great Peas, which you must roul in mealed Gun-powder, and dry them, whereof you may serve your self, according to the method we have prescribed.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are certain odoriferous Pills prepared, which are employed in small Engines and fiery Inventions, which are shewed in Chamber Roams, or close Cabinets, these are commonly prepared of Storax, Calamite, Benjamin, Amber, white and yellow, and of Camphire, of each one ounce, Salt-Peter three ounces, of Coals made of the Teil Tree four ounces; beat all these Ingredients to powder, then incorporate them well together, and moisten them with Rose Water, in which is dissolved Gum-Arabick or Tragacanth, to make thereof little Balls; at last, having fashioned them, expose them to the Sun or to the fire to dry.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Horow A and B draw the Ho∣rizontal lines A D, and B L, <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a square inscribed by various lines and angles</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> and describe the Semicircle A F B about the Diameter A B, which shall somewhere cut the line A C, seeing that A D is a Tangent. Let the Section be in F, and draw the Horizontal line F E, and prolong F G equal to F E; then by G let fall the perpendicular L G D; then about the Diameter G D, by the points G and A, describe the <HI>Parabola</HI> A G, which can be but one, by the precedent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Which</HI> Lemma <HI>was; that about the Diameter</HI> G D, <HI>thorough the</HI> Vertex G, <HI>and any assigned point</HI> A, <HI>there cannot be described more than one</HI> Parabola. <HI>Lemm. of Propos. VIII.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lemma;</HI> nor can there any other <HI>Parabola</HI> be described about the Diameter
<PB N="4" REF="75"/> this is the <HI>Parabola</HI> sought. For the directive line of this <HI>Parabola</HI> is AI, seeing that it toucheth the <HI>Parabola</HI> in A, for EG, or AD, is double to FG by constru∣ction; and therefore DG, and GI are equal: wherefore AI is the Tangent to the <HI>Parabola.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I say, that this <HI>Parabola</HI> is described by the <HI>Impetus</HI> given; for AE, EF, and EB, or those three lines equal to DG the Altitude, GF the Semi-base, and GL are in continual proportion. Wherefore GL is the sublimity, by the V. Proposi∣tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">De metu Projecto∣rum.</NOTE> of <HI>Galiaeus,</HI> and its Corollary.</P>
<P>Then thus: the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the <HI>Parabola</HI> AG in the point A, is as much as that of the Cadent naturally falling from L to D, (by X. of <HI>Galiaeus)</HI> that is, from B to A, or of the Project ascending from A to B: therefore the <HI>Parabola</HI> hath in the point A the <HI>Impetus</HI> that was given: wherefore that is done which was required.</P>
<P>But because this Proposition is of great moment, for clearing of those that follow, we will prove it another way.</P>
<P>Let the same <HI>Impetus</HI> A, B and the same direction AFC be given: the <HI>Parabola</HI> made by this projection is sought, describe as before, a Semicircle about the Diameter <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines and angles</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> AB, which shall cut AC: seeing that AD is a Tangent. Let it cut it in F, and drawing the Horizontal line EFG, so as that EF and FG may be equal, described, or conceive a <HI>Parabola</HI> to be described along by the points A and G about the Dia∣meter GD. I say, that this is the <HI>Parabola</HI> of the Project, if it be thrown from the point A, accord∣ing to the Direction AC, with the <HI>Impetus</HI> AB. Now if the moveable do not run along this same <HI>Parabola</HI> it will run along some other; as suppose A P: let the Vertex, or the highest point of this <HI>Parabola</HI> AP be found, and let it be P.</P>
<P>First, it is manifest that the point P cannot be in the line LD; because since the line AC toucheth each <HI>Parabola,</HI> that ID the common <HI>Axis</HI> should be cut into two equal parts in two points by the Vertex's of the <HI>Parabola,</HI> is absurd. Nor can it be in the line EG: for drawing the Diameter, suppose MN, thorough the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtex, that MN should be cut into two equal parts by the line EG, is absurd: for only ID, of all the lines parallel unto it in the angle CAD, can be cut into two equal parts.</P>
<P>Now let the point P fall any where at pleasure, and draw the Horizontal line PR: for as much as PN and PM are equal, by the II of * this, NR and RA, PR and RS <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which se∣cond Pro∣position is, that the sub∣lime point of the Range of any Pro∣ject <HI>[P]</HI> doth cut the Perpendicular <HI>[M]</HI> intercepted betwixt the Horizon and line of direction, into two equal parts.</NOTE> shall be equal. And because the <HI>Parabola</HI> AP hath the <HI>Impetus</HI> BA; that is, OM, the Point O shall be its sublimity: and for that reason the lines OP, PR, and PM shall be in continual proportion; and the Rectangle OPM equal unto the square PR: and changing the lines with their equals, the Rectangle BSA shall be equal to the square SR: therefore the R is in the point Periphery of the Semicircle: which is absurd; for the right line AF shall meet with the Periphery in two several points: wherefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="corollaries">
<PB N="3" REF="75"/>
<HEAD>COROLLARIES.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, Hence is manifest, that the <HI>Impetus</HI> of <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a parabola inscribed by various angles</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> any Machine being given, as for example EA, if there be described about EA the Semicircle ADE, one may assign the Alti∣tudes and the Amplitudes of all the proje∣ctions that can be made by the same Machine. For example; the <HI>Impetus</HI> EA remaining still the same, let projections be made along the lines of several elevations AC, AD, and AB. The projection made according to the dire∣ction AC, shall ascend as high as to the Ho∣rizontal line FC prolonged: and the pro∣jection made along the direction AD, shall have its Apex in the line HD prolonged: and of the projection made according to the line AB, the greatest Altitude shall be in the Horizontal line GB prolonged.</P>
<P>2. In the Book of <HI>Galilaeus de motu naturaliter accelerato,</HI> it is proved, that projects thrown with the same <HI>Impetus</HI> out of A, if born up by plains of several incli∣nations, do alwayes arrive unto one and the same Horizontal plain. But here it ap∣peareth, that the several ascensions of projects do vary when they are thrown thorough the pure Air, without any fulciment put under them, according to several elevations. For the moveable shall less ascend, which is emitted along the line AB less elevated, than that which shall be projected along AD more elevated.</P>
<P>3. It is manifest also, that no Altitude can in such sort ascend, as that it may reach unto the Horizontal parallel that is drawn thorow E the highest point of the perpen∣dicular projection.</P>
<P>4. It is also manifest, that all Amplitudes do alwayes encrease from that pro∣jection which is called the point blanck Randon, until you come to the projection made at the Semi-right Angle. And from the Semi-right unto the perpendicular, they alwayes diminish until they come to nothing; which hapneth in the perpendicular projection, which hath no Amplitude.</P>
<P>5. From whence we may observe, that the Amplitudes of each <HI>Parabola</HI> made by the same <HI>Impetus,</HI> the elevations of which are equi-distant from the Semi-right, are equal to each other. For, since the lines AB and AC are equi-distant from the Semi-right elevation, the Arches DB and DC <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a parabola inscribed by various angles</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> shall be equal, as subtending equal Angles: and consequently the BA and CE, the remainders of their Quadrants shall be equal: therefore also the Sines of them, BG and CF, shall be equal. And for the same reason, the whole Amplitudes of each <HI>Parabola,</HI> which are Quadruple to the Sines BG and CF, shall be equal.</P>
<P>6. It is manifest likewise that the Altitudes and Sublimities of projections equi-distant from the Semi-right, are reciprocally equal to one another, that is, the Altitude of the one is equal to the sub∣limity of the other.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="76"/>
<P>7. We will therefore make a Corollary of that which to <HI>Galilaeus</HI> was an arduous Theorem, to wit, that the Semi-right <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Randon.</NOTE> projection is the greatest of all those made by the same <HI>Impetus.</HI> For, if you suppose the Angle CAD to be Semi-right, CD shall be the Semi-Diameter; that is the greatest of all the Sines that can be given in the Semi∣circle.</P>
<P>8. It is manifest also, that the whole Amplitude of the Semi-right <HI>Parabola</HI> is double to the line of the Sublimity, or the <HI>Impetus</HI> AB: for it hath been demonstrated to be Qua∣druple of the right line CD, that is double to AB.</P>

<P>LEt the given <HI>Impetus</HI> be AB, and let AD be the fourth part of the Amplitude given. About AB described the Semi-circle ACB, and erect DCE, (which if it shall not fall in the Semi-circle, the the problem is impossible) and let it cut the Semi-circle in the points C and E. I say, that either the direction AC or AE, if the given <HI>Impetus</HI> AB be retained, shall described a <HI>Parabola,</HI> whose Amplitude shall be Quadruple to the line AD, this is manifest from the things preceding. For projections made with the <HI>Impetus</HI> AB, ac∣cording to the directions AC, or AE, have an Amplitude Quadruple to GE, or FC or AD, which are equal to one another; and the Altitude may in the one be AF, as also in the other AG, as appeareth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

The second Classis consists of two Tables added by <HI>Torricellius,</HI> the one of Durations, the other of Eleva∣tions or Randons: the Explanations and Calculations of which are annexed to them by the Author, but here omitted on the account of brevity.</P>

<HEAD>The use of the Precedent TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>SUppose that the greatest Range, namely the Range made at the elevation of the sixth point of the Quadrant by a Culverin, be, for example, 4000 Geometrical paces, I desire with the same Piece to make a shot in such manner that its Range may be just 2360 paces long. I take the fourth part of 2360, which is 590, and I look upon the Table, and find against that Number, that the elevation to be given to the said Piece is 18 Degrees and 5 Minutes, or Gr. 71. and Min. 55, its Complement. And I say, by the things demonstrated, that the forementioned Piece with one of these two Elevations, shall carry the Ball 2360 paces distance above the Horizon. But those Elevations which exceed the sixth point of the Quadrant, are not inserted for the use of * Artillery, but only for Morter-Pieces, Rams, and Granadoes. It is to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">That is, all long Pieces.</NOTE> noted, therefore, that with that same first Elevation the Ball will make a low Range, <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a high, arcing parabola inscribed by a lower, flatter one</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> but swift, as the line marked A, and with a great Horizontal <HI>Impetus,</HI> pro∣per to make breaches in Walls, or give other lateral impulses. But with the other Elevation it shall describe the Range B, which shall be slow in its Horizontal motion, but with suffi∣cient perpendicular <HI>Impetus</HI> at the last, proper to batter Vaults, Roofs, and to make other breaches perpendicular to the Horizon; or to cast things to any determinate mark. as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>v. gr.</HI> little Baggs im∣baled with Cord, full of Sulphur, Salt-Peeter, or Meal, or Balls with Letters or other things within them. In a word, both those Elevations that are equally distant from the sixth point, will carry the Ball unto the same place: but yet with this difference, that with the first and least Elevation it shall fall to the Earth (as Gunners speak) Grazing; and with the second and greater Elevation, it shall descend almost plumb, or perpendicular.</P>
<P>I know that its very seldom, and perhaps never found, that the greatest Range of a Piece of Ordnance is just those 4000 Paces, as it seemeth to have been supposed in the Calculating of our Table, and also in those of <HI>Signiore Galileo,</HI> so that the said Table might seem unuseful: but we shall shew, that the supposed number of 4000 doth not therefore serve to any great particular Machine, to the end it might serve to all in general. It is necessary therefore to take notice, that that same suppositious Number of 4000, is not of Paces, or of Ells, or of Yards, or of any other determinate measure, but of abstracted parts, such yet, whatever they are, as being convertible into any kinds of possible measures, they do make the Table general, as well for the Culvering, as for the Mortar-Piece or Cross-Bow. And to give an example how it may be adapted and applyed to all the Species of Artillery, and how the Abstract parts may be reduced into Geometrical paces, we will do thus.</P>
<P>The greatest Range of a Canon, by experiment made thereof, is found to be suppose 2300 paces; and I would with the same Piece make a shot that should be 860 paces, I do thus: If the greatest Range 2300 give 860, I ask what the number 1000, the greatest of the Table will give? I work and find 374: which number being sought in the Table, is found to be betwixt 370 and 380. Therefore taking the part proportional according to my Judgement, I find the Arch of its Elevation ought to be <HI>Grad.</HI> 11. very near, or its Complement <HI>gr.</HI> 79. And thus it is cer∣tain,
<PB N="9" REF="78"/> that that same Piece which being mounted to six points did carry 2300 paces. being elevated <HI>gr.</HI> 11. or 79. of the Quadrant, shall carry 860 paces, as we did desire.</P>

<HEAD>PROBLEME.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How by a Shot made casually, one may find the greatest Range of an Ordnance.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LEt a Piece be directed according to the Mounture A C; of which let the Elevation be the Angle B A C, whatever it is. And the said Angle being measured with the Quadrant, let it <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabolas, angles, and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> be sound; for exam∣ple, <HI>gr.</HI> 30. then let off the Piece, and let the Shot reach to the point B: and let the line A B be carefully measured, which sup∣pose to be <HI>v. gr.</HI> 2400 Geometrical Paces, I say that these two things being given, namely the Eleva∣tion, and the length of the casual Range A G B, you have therewithal given the line A D, which is the half of the greatest Range, according to what hath been demonstrated in the last Corollary of the first Proposition, <HI>De Motn Projectorum.</HI></P>
<P>The Angle of Elevation C A B <HI>gr.</HI> 30, being given, the right Angled Triangle E A C shall be given in Specie: and because A B is given in paces, A E shall be given, which is the fourth part thereof, namely 600 paces. Let us therefore, to find the quantity of A D, work in this manner by Calculations and Sines.</P>
<P>Say, if as the Right Sine 86602 of the Angle A C E, <HI>gr.</HI> 60. that is, of the Complement of the Elevation, is to the side A E, which is 600: so is the whole Sine 100000 to a fourth number 693: and thus the Hypothenuse A C shall be 693 Paces. But because that the right angled Triangle A C D is given in Specie, begin again and say, as the right Sine 50000 of the angle A D C, which is equal to the angle given of the Elevation E A C, is to the right Line A C, which is found to be 693 paces, so is the whole line to a fourth number 1386. And thus the right line sought A D, shall be 1386 paces. But because A D, being the line of <HI>Impetus</HI> or Sublimity, is equal to half the greatest Range; if we double 1386, we shall make the number of 2772 paces; for so much shall be the length of the desired greatest Range of that Gun, which being elevated to the Randon of <HI>gr.</HI> 30, is found to carry 2400 paces.</P>
<P>But with much more brevity, and at one single working, we may perform the same thus. Suppose the whole Sine to be C F, then F A and F D shall be the Taugents, one, of the angle of elevation, and the other of its Complement. Say, therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as the whole Sine is to C F, which is 600: so is 230940 (which is the
<PB N="10" REF="79"/> sum of both those Tangents) to a fourth number 1386. And thus the right line AD is found, as before, 1386 paces: which being doubled, will give the measure of the Semirect, or greatest * Randon, as you well call it. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Or the best of the Randon.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>PROBLEM.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How with the sole Table of Sines we may know the greatest Altitude, to which the Ball hath attained passing through the Air in a Range, the Elevation and length of the said Range be∣ing given.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the precedent Figure, let there be given the angle of the Elevation CAB, and the length of the Range AB: it is required to know the greatest Altitude to which the Ball hath arrived thorough the Air: and this shall be EC. Take again AE 600 paces, that is, the <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabolas, angles, and lines, identical to previous figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> fourth part of the whole length AB: and then say, as 86602 the Sine of the Angle ACE, the Supplement of the Elevation, is to AE, 600 paces, so is 50000, the Sine of the Elevation EAC to a fourth number: and we shall find 346 paces for measure of the Altitude CE, that is, of the greatest Altitude to which the Ball had attained in its passage through the Air,</P>
<PB N="14" REF="79"/>
<P>It is to be noted, that great Guns are not alwayes used so as that the Ball goeth to determine in the same Horizontal plain from which it did depart, as <HI>Galileo</HI>'s and our Tables do suppose. Therefore being to shoot upon the side of a Hills declivity or acli∣vity, as also being to shoot from the summity of a Rock upon the Horizontal plain that is below, there hath no mans as yet reduced the measures of these Ranges to an Art. The Table of them might be calculated, but every one will perceive, that it being to be composed by every grade of the Pieces Elevation or Mounture, and by every grade of the Hills inclination, and by every pace of the Hills Altitude, the Multipli∣cation would be almost infinite. We will therefore only give you the general Rule for calculating those Ranges when they shall occur.</P>
<P>A <HI>Piece</HI> with the direction AB, maketh the Range ACD: but I would shoot along the inclined plain AC; and I desire to know what AC, the length of the Range of that shot upon this plain, shall be. <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabolas, angles, and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> Draw BD by the point D, and HF by the point C, perpendiculars to the Hori∣zon; and draw a line from F to E; which by the things demonstrated, is parallel to AB. Measure with some Instrument the angle DAE, that is the Hills Elevation, and, by the Table of Amplitudes, you shall find the length of the Horizontal Range AD. Then say, as DB the Tangent of the angle of the Pieces, Elevation is to BE, which is the difference of the Tan∣gents of the two angles DAB and DAE known, (one being the Elevation of the Piece, the other the Elevation of the Hill above the Horizon) so is DA known, in paces, to a fourth number: and the right line FA shall befound in paces. Then say again, as the whole Sine is to that fourth number, which is the measure of AF in pa∣ces, so is AC the secant of the angle FAC, to a fourth number: and thus you shall know the number of paces that measure the line AC, that is, the length of the Range that that Piece will make upon the plain AE, when you shoot upwards.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="80"/>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabolas, angles, and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>But when from the point A it is required to shoot downwards by a descending Hill, as AB, we shall find the quantity of the Range AB, that is, the place where the Ball falleth, in this manner. Let the direction AE, that is, let the angle of the Pieces Elevation be given; also let there be given the angle of the Hills inclination CAB. Let us imagine the Horizon to be AC, and let us draw BE and HDF perpendiculars to the same: and conjoyn or draw a line from C to H, which line shall be parallel to AE. Now upon the Table of Amplitudes we shall find how many paces AD is, but we seek the quantity of AB. Therefore make the calculation thus; as FD the Tangent of the angle of the Pieces Eleva∣tion is to DH, the Tangent of the inclination of the plain; so is AD, known in paces, to a farther number. And this shall be the mea∣sure of DC in paces; and thus the whole line AC shall be known in paces. Then say again, as AC the whole Sine is to AC known in paces, so it AB the a fourth number: and this last number shall be the measure sought of the right line AB in paces; that is, the length of the Range upon the descending plain AB. It happeneth also many times, that we are to shoot at plains perpendicular to the Horizon, as at the Walls of Cities, or Towers, or other wayes; there∣fore also in this case we will subjoyn the Com∣putation for finding the Altitude of that point in the said Wall where the Ball is to hit.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabolas, angles, and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Let the Direction of the Piece be the Line AB, and the Horizon AC, and the Wall of the Tower DE perpendicular to the Ho∣rizon: and let the distance AD be known in paces. Let us suppose that the Ball passeth freely without hitting the Wall, and falleth upon the Horizon in C. The Table of the Amplitudes giveth the quantity of AC, but we seek the Altitudes DE. Draw CB per∣pendicular to the Horizon, and DF parallel to AB, and then draw a line from F to A, which shall pass thorow the common Section of the <HI>Parabola,</HI> and of the Wall, as may be collected from the things already demon∣strated. Now say, as CA the length of the Horizontal line is to CD the difference be∣twixt the lines AC and AD already known, so is BC the Tangent of the angle of the Ele∣vation of the Piece, to CF the Tangent of the angle FAC. Again say, as the Sine Total is to AD known in paces, so is the last found Tangent of the angle FAC to a fourth number: which shall be the desired measure of the right line DE in paces. And thus we
<PB N="13" REF="80"/> have found the point E in which the said shot would stick. The same calculation may be also deduced. Although the Wall DE be not perpendicular, but scarfed, as those of the modren Fortresses; but fearing to procure you more trouble than bene∣fit, I will refer the care of that to the Geometrician that hath a mind to under∣take it.</P>
<P>The Amplitudes of the <HI>Parabola</HI>'s, of which <HI>Galileo,</HI> and also we do treat, suppose that the Range terminates not upon the plain of the Field, but in that Horizontal plain that passeth by the Muzzle of the Piece. The other is only true when the Peice is placed with its Carriages in a Trench, so that the mouth of the Piece lyeth exactly level with the ground. But because this is not usual, and because the Ranges do determine in the Horizon that toucheth the lower parts of the Wheels, we will Geometrically enquire how much a level Range, or Horizontal Range may be prolonged by means of the Altitude of the Muzzle of the Piece above the plain of the Field. It seemeth that the Se∣midiameter of the wheels, and the thickness of the Metal do cause the Muzzles of ordi∣nary Artillery to be above the Horizontal Site about two Braces. I suppose therefore the Muzzle of the Culvering to be at A. and let the Horizon be BC; and let the Altitude of the Muzzle be the right line AB, supposed to be two Braces; and let the Range ACD be the level Range. The right line BC is sought; let the Semirect Range, or the best of the Randon of the same Piece, be the <HI>Parabola</HI> AEF; and let it be sup∣posed that AF be 5000 Geometrical paces, that is a 15000 Florentine Braces. De∣scribe the usual Semi-circle of the first Proposition AHI, and having drawn AL equal to AI apply LD. The right line AI, by the things demonstrated, shall be the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the <HI>Parabola</HI> AEF, or of ACD (for they are Ranges of the same Piece) therefore AL shall be the fourth part of the right side of the <HI>Parabola</HI> ACD: there∣fore LD shall be double of LA: but AF hath been demonstrated to be also double of AI; therefore LD and <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabolas, angles, and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> AF are equal; and there are three lines given, that is, LA 7500. LD 15000. and AB 2. And therefore, working by the Rule of three, as the right line LA is to AB known; so is the square of the right line LD to another number: we shall find 60000; whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h shall be the square of the right line BC; and extracting the Square root thereof, we shall find the line BC to be 245 Braces. We conclude therefore that that Machine which ma∣keth its greatest Range of 15000 Braces, in case it shall have its Muzzle raised above the Horizon, will make its level Range, that is, without any Elevation or Mounture, to be in all 245 Braces long. Next, how much every other Range not level, but inclined upwards or downwards, by occasion of the Altitude of the wheels, or of a Bastion, or of a Mount, or of any other scituation that raiseth it above the Horizontal plain, may be prolonged, shall be found thus.</P>
<P>It is certain, that being to shoot from the top of a Rock, or of a Castle placed in the top of an Hill, or from any whatever high place above the Horizontal plain of the Field that lyeth below, the Ranges will prove much longer than those noted upon the Table of Amplitudes; and this difference shall be so much greater, by how much the scitu∣ation of the Artillery shall be higher above that Horizontal plain in which Balls are to hit, and the Rangers to determine.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="81"/>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabola, angles, and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Let the height of the Hill or other place be G F, and from the point F, let a line be drawn upon the plain of the Field G E: and let us suppose the Horizon to be F B: now having made the Range F C B E at an Elevation, the measure of G E is sought.</P>
<P>By the Table of Amplitudes, we find the quantity of A B, and by the Table of Altitude, we find A C, the height of the <HI>Parabola.</HI> And for the working of the Computation, it may be performed sundry wayes.</P>
<P>Let the number of A B be squared, and divide that square by A C, and the <HI>Quotus</HI> shall be the right side of the <HI>Parabola</HI> F C B: Then multiply that <HI>Quotus</HI> by C D, and the square Root of the Product shall give D E.</P>
<P><HI>Or we may work thus:</HI></P>
<P>Draw the number D C into C A, and the square Root of the product shall be the mean proportional betwixt D C and C A. Then say, as C A is to the fore-mentioned Root, so is A B to another number. And this fourth number shall again be D E.</P>
<P><HI>Or lastly, in this manner:</HI></P>
<P>Say, as the number C A, the Altitude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> in the Table, is to the num∣ber C D, the Altitude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> and Range together, so is A B the Semi-Ampli∣rude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> in the Table to another fourth number.</P>
<P>Then take the number that is mean-proportional betwixt that last number and A B, for that mean-proportionall shall give you the said D E. And for as much as D G, equal to A B is known, the whole line G E shall be known.</P>
<P>But some might alleadge, that from the Mount G F, it may perhaps be required to play with Guns oftner downwards than upwards; therefore it would be necessary to know by a Geometrical Rule, the length of Ranges, which is done in this manner. Let the Range to be made downwards be that marked F H, with any whatever angle of inclination beneath the Horizon: G H is sought. Imagine with your self that the Range is to be made above the Horizon with the self same inclination; and by the precedent Rules, the quantity of D E is found as above, or D H, from which if we take the part already known F A, or D G, there shall remain known the quantity required G H. But if <HI>gr.</HI> 40 being given for the Elevation of the Range A B C, and the Base A C 1600 Paces, we would know all the different Altitudes of the Ranges of the Ball upon any point of the line A C, work thus: Having divided A C in the <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabola and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> midst, and erected D B, this shall be the Su∣pream Altitude, and shall be found in the Table of Altitudes and Amplitudes working in this manner. In the Table of Amplitudes right against <HI>gr.</HI> 40. of Elevation, I find the line A D to be 9848 parts: but in the Table of Altitudes I find the line B D to be 4132 parts. Then, by the Rule of Three, I say; if A D 9848 give 800 paces according to the supposition, how many paces shall D B, which is 4132 parts, give? and I find, that the right line B D is 336 paces. Now let any point be proposed, as E, over which you would know the Altitude of the Range of the Ball, that is the line E H. Let the right line A E be supposed 1000, and E C 600: and work the Rule of three again, in this manner. If the square of A D,
<PB N="15" REF="81"/> which is 640000, give the Rect-angle of the right lines A E and E C which is 600000, what shall the number B D (which was found to be 336) give? and I find 315 paces. Therefore the Altitude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> over the point E, was 315 paces; which is that that was sought.</P>
<P>It shall suffice to have hinted this little for the Calculating of some varieties that may happen about these Ranges. Other cases may be put, like to these, and particu∣larly those of their conversions; but from the knowledge of these, those may easily be deducted: and the Ingenuity of any Geometrician, applying himself thereto, shall find less difficulty in resolving many of these Problems of himself than in under∣going the length and obscurity of our explanations. Therefore we will proceed to the making of the Quadrant, the which seemeth really appropriated, nay, made by Nature on purpose for to measure Scientifically and Geometrically the Ranges of Projects.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="quadrant" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Quadrant.</HEAD>
<P>LEt us now come to practice; and by help of an Instrument, let us resolve some of the Propositions above demonstrated. We will make a Military Quadrant, which with invariable certainty sheweth (at least to Geometrical Philosophers, if not to practical Gunners) what Mounture or Elevation ought to be given to any Piece, to the end that the length of the Range may prove to be of such a certain measure. We will also resolve, by help hereof, all Problems that can be framed about the shooting of Artillery, which were heretofore promised by <HI>Tartaglia,</HI> and reduced into Tables by <HI>Galileo,</HI> with something over and above. Military Industry did find that the use of a Machine so noble, and of so great consequence as the Canon, would be too much confined, and of too little benefit, if it could not be made use of save only at that small distance to which it carrieth a point blank, or in its level Range, without giving it with the Quadrant the advantageous assistance of some elevation. It was therefore enquired how a man might do that with the same Piece, which of it self did not carry more than 200 or 250 Geometrical paces, he might shoot 400 and also 600 paces, and more and more, until he come to the length of the greatest Range that can be made by that Piece. The Invention was thus: They began to help the Piece by Elevation, that is, they directed it not straight upon th' object which it was to hit, but, holding it in the very vertical of th' object, they elevated it above that right line which goeth from the Piece unto the object: and this they did some∣times more, and sometimes less, according as the force of the Shot was to be greater or lesser: An Artifice that from the very beginning of the world hath been known even to artless Boyes. We see that when they with a Ball of Snow, or other matter, do aim to hit a mark that is very near, they throw it directly at the mark: but being at another time to aim at one which standeth farther off, or being to throw Stones at each other, they do not throw Horizontally, or directly at their Adversaries, but turning the cast half way into the Air, without having ever had any other conside∣ration, they do all throw at the elevation of the fifth, and also of the sixth point of the Military Square to them unknown: But Gunners, in process of time, have found an Instrument, that doth with facility measure these Elevations.</P>
<P><HI>Nicolo Tartaglia</HI> of <HI>Brescia,</HI> a famous Mathematician, did invent a Square with unequal sides joyned together with the Quadrant, which hath for more than a hundred years past, been generally used, and is still the only Regulator of Gunners, not only to manage great Guns, and to raise them to those Mountures which they call Randons, but also to level them in the Point-blank Ranges; <HI>Tartaglia</HI> divided that Quadrant into 12 equal parts, beginning the Numeration of them from the lesser [or shorter] side; he also subdivided each of those into other 12 equal parts, naming those first
<PB N="16" REF="82"/> Points, and these second Minutes of the Quadrant. We will insert the figure of the Quadrant, and shew how it measureth the Elevation [Mounture or Randon] of the Piece.</P>
<P>Let the Canons * Soul be A B, fixed at some certain Mounture: put into the Muz∣zle <NOTE PLACE="marg">Her Con∣cave, Ci∣linder, or Bore.</NOTE> thereof the greater of the Quadrant C A: so that it be applyed to the lower side of the said Soul, and let the Plummet fall in D.

<FIGDESC>quadrant measuring an angle</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> arch E D, is the measure of the Elevation of the Piece. Draw an Ho∣rizontal line A F, the angles at the point G shall be right: But the angle A C F is also right. There∣fore the angles C A F, and F C G are e∣qual by the 8 of the sixth of <HI>Euclid.</HI> Or thus; Draw thorough C the Horizontal line. If H I now from the right angles H C D and A C E there be taken the common part A C D, there shall remain th' Angle E C D of the Quadrant, equal to the angle of the Piece under the Horizon H I, or above the Horizon A F, which is the same as being alterne.</P>
<P>By the help of this Quadrant Gunners have with long observations composed such a <HI>Praxis,</HI> as that they know how many points they are to mount <HI>v. gr.</HI> a Culvering of 40 pound Ball to hit a mark distant; for example, 700 Geometrical paces, or at any other distance.</P>
<P>But the truth is, the observations are so sallible, and the Gunners so few that have made them, and made them exactly, that the use of Artillery, taking from it the Range of Point Blank, must needs have very little of certainty in it.</P>
<P>If one would collect some certain Science touching th' ordinary Quadrant, it would be necessary to make the Experiments not only with all sorts of Balls, and with all the varieties of Powder, but in all kind of Pieces, as also in all those that being the same <HI>in specie,</HI> are of different grandeur; and lastly, at all possible degrees of Elevation. A Multiplication that almost runs up into infinity. And we observe that these Expe∣riments ought to be all made one by one; for it is not true, that by way of proportion one may from three or four Ranges of a Canon made at several elevations, argue to any others, no not of the same Canon, laden with the same Powder and Ball. That this is so, may be demonstrated by help of the Tables made by <HI>Signiore Galilaeo,</HI> and by us. For example, That Canon which being elevated at the sixth Point, curryeth its shot 4000 paces, elevated at one Point, ought to curry the sixth part, at two points the third, and at three points the half of that Range. But the thing falls out far otherwise: For being elevated to one point, it curryeth 1032 instead of 666, which is the sixth part of that same greatest Range 4000: at the second point (and note that with this Mounture, Pieces carry alwayes the half of the greatest Range) in our case will curry 2000 in stead of 1333, which is the third part: At the third point it will curry 2824, instead of 2000, which is the half of the greatest Range: at the fourth point it will curry 3464 instead of 2666: At the fifth point it will curry 3860, in stead of 2333, which are 5 sixths of that greatest Range: See therefore how that increasing equally the Mountures of the Piece, that is shooting first at one point only, then at two, three, four, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unto the sixth, the increases of the lengths of the Ranges do not increase equally, that is with the same proportion wherewith the
<PB N="17" REF="82"/>
* Randons increase. But the first point currying 1032, the second increaseth above it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Or Moun∣tures.</NOTE> 968, the third increaseth 824, the fourth 640, the fifth 396, the sixth 140. There∣fore to derive some rule from the Experiments, it were necessary to make them exa∣ctly, at all the Grades of Randons, in all sorts of Pieces, with all varieties of Powders, and different matters of Balls; and happily one might say, it were necessary also that every Gunner made them by himself. Things almost impossible to reduce unto Rules, from which any certainty might be gathered, if the Theorick and Geometry had not given us a manifest Science thereof, by means of that one sole Proposition of <HI>Galileo,</HI> in which first of all men he hath advertised and taught us, <HI>That Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects do all move in a Parabolical Line.</HI> Upon this supposition we will ground the Instrument promised: and though by the impediment of the <HI>medium</HI> the <HI>Parabola's</HI> become too deformed, or by many other accidents the Ranges prove very inconstant, yet it suffi∣ceth us to have given indubitable satisfaction to the School of Mathematicians, if not to that of Gunners.</P>
<P>Before we set down the making of our square, which consisteth only in describing one single Semi-circle, we will divide the ordinary Quadrant into unequal points, so as they may not measure the Randons of the Piece, but the lengths of the Ranges, which is that that serves to our purpose. Thus we shall be assured, that the Gun, if it shall be elevated to one point of the said Quadrant, shall carry to such a distance, whatever it be: and elevated to two points, shall precisely double that Range: and if to three, it shall carry three of those spaces; if to four and a half, it shall carry four and a half; if to five and a quarter, it shall carry five and a quarter; and thus until you come to the sixth point, shall the points of the Quadrant in the Instrument, and the spaces of the Ranges in the Field, alwayes increase in the same manner, and with the same proportion, and from the sixth to the twelfth point, they shall go in the same manner decreasing. The construction and demonstration is Geometrically taken from the proposition which we have made the First of this our Book of Projects, which by the Amplitude given, teacheth us to find the Elevation. And it serveth in common for whatsoever sort of Artillery and Mortar Pieces, and for any sort of Ball or Powder.</P>
<P>Let the sides of the Quadrant be A B the greater and A C the lesser; then making A the Center, describe the Quadrant C D E, upon which the unequal points are <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>quadrant measuring an angle</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> to be marked or set off: and about the Diameter A C draw the Semi∣circle A F C; and having drawn F G perpendicular to A B, and Tangent to the Semi-circle, divide A G into six equal parts to find the six points of the Quadrant, and then again, each part into 12 to find the Minutes, (if the size of the Instrument shall admit of this second division) now let one of the six parts be G H. Draw H M I parallel to G F, cutting the Semi∣diameter in the points M and I, and then from the Center A, draw the right line A F D, and D shall be the sixth point of the square: draw A I L, and L shall be the fifth point of the square: draw A M N, and N shall be the seventh point; and so of all the rest. Note, that the division will be the more exact, if after you have found the 1, 2, 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> points, you do by the Transportation or setting of them off, design the ninth, tenth, and eleventh.
<PB N="18" REF="83"/> The half points, quarter points, and Minutes, are found in the same manner by subdi∣viding each of the portions of the line A G into two, into four, or into twelve parts, which raising perpendiculars from the points of the Divisions: Those perpendiculars shall cut the Semi-circle, and by the points of the Sections shall the Diameters be drawn in the Quadrant, and these shall cut the Quadrant in the parts desired, of Half points, Quarter points, or Minutes.</P>
<P>Now it is manifest by our I. Proposition, that if the line of the *direction, or of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Moun∣ture.</NOTE> the elevation of the Piece shall be A O, or A P, the Amplitude or length of the Range shall be as the Quadruple of the S O; and if the direction shall be A M, or A N, the Range shall be as the Quadruple of R M: and if the elevation were accord∣ing to the line A F D, the Range shall be as the Quadruple of Q F: but the lines S O, R M, and Q F, by our construction do equally exceed: And, therefore, like∣wise their Quadruples, or the Ranges aforesaid, shall equally exceed one the other.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The use of the aforementioned Division made in the ordinary Quadrant.</HEAD>
<P>LEt there be propounded any Piece of Artillery, or Mortar-Piece; and with it let there be one single Experiment made, that is, let it be elevated to any point, as for example to the fifth. Let it off, and measure the length of the Range, and let it be found, <HI>verbi gratia,</HI> to be 2000 parts; this done we may know how far the same Piece will carry, being charged in the same manner, and elevated to any what-ever ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Point or Minute: which shall be easie by the Rule of three, the points in this Instrument, as well as the length of the Ranges, being proportional. The <HI>Praxis</HI> is this; I desire to know how far the sixth point carrieth, I thus say, If five points give 2000 paces, how much shall six points give? and I find 2400 paces. I say then that the shot of that Piece at the sixth point, that is at the greatest Range, will curry 2400 of those parts, at which of the fifth point it curried 2000.</P>
<P>And take notice by the way, that instead of performing this operation with the points 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, It may be done with their Complements, which are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.</P>
<P>But if it were required (which importeth much more) that we should elevate the aforesaid Piece in such sort, that the length of the Range ought to be; for example, 1300 paces, we are to work thus. If 2000 paces, were made by 5 points, or to say better, by 60 Minutes of the Quadrant, by how many points shall 1300 paces be made? the working will be 2000. 60. 1300. 39, and we shall find that for to make the Range of 1300 paces, it would be necessary to give the Piece the Mounture of 39 Mi∣nutes of the Quadrant, or of three points and a quarter.</P>

Proposition. But let us proceed to the making of it.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled rectangle inscribed by a labeled parabola</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Take the Rect-angled Plate A B C D, of Brass, or other solid Matter, having the side A E long, for the applying of it to the Piece. Upon the Diameter A B, draw a Semi-circle A F B, which shall be the Semi∣circle
<PB N="19" REF="83"/> of Proposit. I. <HI>De Projectis;</HI> and in B place the Thred and Plummet, and divide the Semi-circle A F B into 90 equal parts, which shall be the 90 degrees of the Quadrant; or into 144 equal parts, which shall be the equal Points and Minutes of the ordinary Quadrant. Let us now demonstrate Geometrically, that this square is convenient to measure, with exceeding plainness, the lengths and the Altitudes of the Ranges, the times of their Durations, the sublimities of the <HI>Parabola</HI>'s, and the Elevations of the Pieces. And then we will set down the Division of the Lines there∣upon, without the need of any Table for the using of the same.</P>
<P>Let us, as in the subsequent Figure, place the square afore-named E A B C D in the mouth of any Piece, E A at pleasure, and let the Plummet fall upon the point F of the Semi-circle A F B, divided into 90 equal <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines emerging from the mouth of a cannon</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> parts. It is certain, in the first place, that the Arch B F measureth the Elevation of the Piece E A above the Horizon. For we hav∣ing by the Division of the Semi-circle into 90 parts only, valued every two degrees for one; we have made the Arch B F to be the measure of the Angle B A F, that is, of the Elevation of the Piece above the Horizon; which Horizon shall ever be the line A F. I say moreover, that if we should suppose the line A B, Diameter of the Semi-circle, to be the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the assigned Piece, or the half of the greatest Range, the line F H, per∣pendicular to the Diameter, shall be the fourth part of the Amplitude or length of the Range; B H shall be the supream Altitude of the <HI>Parabola:</HI> A H shall be the sublimity; and B F shall be the time of the Ranges Du∣ration.</P>
<P>That this is so, shall thus be demonstrated (having reference to the I. proposition of Projects, and its Corollaries.) Let the line of the direction A B I be prolonged in∣definitely, as also the perpendicular T B L; then by imagination take B L of such a length, that it may be really equal to half the greatest Range of our present Piece. And about the Diameter B L, let there be imaginarily drawn the great Semi-circle B I L; cutting the Circumference B I in any point I; and draw the Horizontal line I M. It is manifest, by the afore-cited Propos. I. of Projects, that the line M I shall be the real fourth part of the length of the Range; as also, that D M shall be the (not imiginary, but real Altitude of the said Range; and so the other measures in the Semi∣circle B I L, shall be all true and real. Now observe, that the Triangle H B F is like to the Triangle B I M, as being right-angled, and having two angles at the Point B. Therefore the same Proposition shall be between all the small and imaginary measures of the square A C, as is between all the true measures in the imaginary and great Semi-circle B I L; that is, the lines, A B, B F, F H and H B, shall be to one another in the same proportion respectively as L B, B I, I M, and M B. Therefore, as to arguing in the proportions, we may without any error, as well make use of those feigned pro∣portions upon the square, as of the true ones, imagined in the Amplitude of the Air.</P>
<P>It remains now that we shew how this Doctrine, which hath hitherto been a meer Speculation, may now reduced to Manual practice, and that with facility. Every one seeth that for our obtaining knowledge of the quantity of the lines A B, B F, F H, and H B, and their proportions in the precedent Figure, it would be necessary that all the aforesaid lines were divided into most Minute parts with some common measure. To this purpose, therefore, we will divide the Diameter A B, and Semi-Diameter E D, into equal and very small parts, as appeareth in the following Figure; (upon which let us describe the imaginary square) and then let us give to each division of
<PB N="20" REF="84"/> the circumference, its guides parallel to those Diameters, that so in them the number and quantity of the lines which shall be Indices of the length and Altitudes of the Ranges, may be read or found: And in the point of the angle of Semi-circle B, place the Thread and Plummet.</P>
<P>As to the number of parts into which the Diameter A B is to be divided, it shall be left to the choice of every one; but yet it will be convenient to make choice of the number 2000, for that it will facilitate the Arithmetical operation.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, that if any one will make a square, as hath been said, on purpose for one kind of Artillery onely, he shall without the least trouble of Calculation, have the measures of all its Ranges.</P>
<P>The Division of this square is to be made <HI>a posteriori,</HI> in this manner. Make an Expe∣riment of the greatest Range of that same Piece to which you would have the square to be adapted, and let it be found <HI>v. gr.</HI> to be 3000. Then divide the Diameter of the square into 1500 parts, and the perpendicular Semi-diameter into 750 equal parts; that is, imagine that the Diameter A B 1500, is the half of the greatest Range 3000; as also, that the perpendicular Semi-diameter E D 750, is the fourth part of that great∣est Range. And thus, every of the other Elevations being afterwards given, as soon as we shall apply this Square to the Muzzle of the Piece, we shall immediately see how many paces is the length, and how many the Altitude of the Range, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this square made <HI>v. gr.</HI> for a Canon of 60 pound Ball, would be also good for every other Canon of 60 pound Ball, that should be the same in length, and other proportions, with that.</P>
<P>It's true indeed, that if we would make the square universal, to serve indifferently for all Species and Magnitudes of Artillery, we must then do thus. Divide the Diameter A B in the precedent figure in 2000 equal parts: also let the Semi-Diameter E D be divided into 1000 equal parts, (we by reason of the smallness of the figure have divided it only into 100, taking the parts by ten and ten.) This done, let there be drawn by the Divisions of the Circumference, cut into equal degrees, as is usual, the guides parallel unto the Diameters, that so one may upon those Diameters read or find the quantity of the right lines, as they shall happen to be.</P>
<P>Now let a Piece of Ordnance F G, unknown, be given. Then make the previous Experiment in this manner. Apply the square to the Muzzle of it, and let the thread fall in any place, as in I. Then find by the means <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines emerging from the mouth of a cannon</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> of its guide, the quantity of I O upon the divided Semi-Diameter, and keep it in mind, and then shoot off the Gun, and mea∣sure the Range, which suppose to be, for Example, 1250 paces: charge the Piece again in the same manner, and give it a different Mounture, so that the thread may fall else∣where, as in M: the length of this Range is sought. Say thus: If the number of I O give the length 1250 paces, how many paces shall the number of M L, that is found upon the divided Semi-diameter give? and you shall in like manner find the length of that Range numbred in paces.</P>
<P>If you desire the Altitudes, and not the lengths of Ranges, then make the same work∣ing as before, but not with the lines I O and M L, which give the lengths, but with H O and H L, which give the Altitudes. And if we would have the sublimities, it would be necessary to work with G O and G L. But, which more importeth, if any one after the previous Experiment hath been made, shall desire that the same Piece may make an assigned Range, in length, <HI>v. gr.</HI> 2200 paces,
<PB N="21" REF="84"/> we are to find what elevation ought to be given to the Piece. Work thus: If the 1250 paces of the previous Experiment give I O numbred, what shall the 2200 paces give? and you shall find a number, which suppose for example, to be ascribed on the square unto the line M L. the Peice Therefore is to be raised to such a Randon, that the thread may pass thorow the point M; and then the Range shall be 2200 paces.</P>
<P>The times or durations of the Ranges are given by the Lines H I and H M: and to find the Quantity of these it may be done two wayes. First, by way of calculation: For the square of the time H I (in the pre∣cedent Figure) is alwayes equal to the two squares of the Altitude H O, and of the fourth part of the length I O. Secondly, by making to all the Divisions of the Perifry B, C, D, (in the present Figure) from the Center A the circular guides B E, C F, D H: for A H being thus divided into very small equal parts, it shall measure all the right lines, A B, A C, and A D, which are the times of the Ranges.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines emerging from the mouth of a cannon</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Yet we confess as to Military use, the Amplitudes or lengths of Ranges, only seem to Import; and they are of great moment: the rest are all accessary curiosities, which serve much more to the pleasures of Geome∣try, than to the occasions of War; therefore he that would have the square made only for this respect of Longitudes, may take the Semi∣circle A B C of Brass (as in the present Figure) having its side A D, and with the Semicircle E B, divided into most minute and equal parts, beginning the numeration from the point E; and may give moreover to all the points of the Perifry F, G, H, I, their guides G H, and F I parallel to A C: And thus he hath divided and numbred upon E B all the lines F N, and G O, which serve for the Am∣plitudes or Longitudes of the Ranges.</P>

<P>For Example, It is demanded where the Division of the one seventh unequal point doth fall. Look upon the present Table, right against the number VII, and you find that it falleth upon <HI>gr.</HI> 61. and <HI>min.</HI> 47. of the ordinary Quadrant.</P>
<P>But since we are fallen upon the consideration of the Motion and <HI>Impetus</HI> of Projects, we cannot balk th' occasion of adding somthing concerning the va∣riety of their Forces in battering upon resisting Superficies, somtimes with greater, and somtimes with lesser Angles of Inclination. <HI>Galilaeo</HI> considereth th' <HI>Impetus</HI> of these Projects in every Point of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>Panahola,</HI> and measureth how much it is in its self, that is, in respect of that Plane in which it doth perpendicularly hit.</P>
<P>We presupposing that an <HI>Impetus,</HI> when it is upon the act of striking, is, as to it self, alwayes the same, will consider and measure how much it is in respect of the resisting Plane, varyed only by the diversity of th' Angles of Incidence. There is no Gunner so unskilful, but he knoweth that Cannon Bullets in hitting a Wall, have alwayes lesser and lesser force (if all things else be alike) by how much the Angle of Incidence is more and more acute. So that if the said Cannon with sixty pounds of Iron, and forty of Powder, not only pierceth, but beateth down a Courtin, with its perpendicular Range, it shall scarce hurt it (though it have the same Charge, and the same distance) with the Projection of the Range, which they call *Grazing. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di striscio.</NOTE> The Probleme, for any thing that I know, is unhandled. Therefore if we shall pro∣duce somthing that is less subsistent, and not purely Geometrical, either admit it till some others shall better handle the Doctrine, or wholly reject it, it matters not which.</P>

<P><FIGURE>

<P N="4">4. Let us suppose, in the next place, that all the Ran∣ges have, as to themselves, the same <HI>Impetus:</HI> which will happen if the Piece being fixed alwayes in the same place with the same Charge, the same Mounture, and Di∣stance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the obliquity of the Wall be only varied.</P>
<P>This supposed: when a Cannon Bull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t approacheth to the opposed Wall, the Line and Direction of the Range is either perpendicular to the Wall, or not. If it be perpendicular, the Percussion operateth with such a cer∣tain force: which we will prove to be the greatest that that Range can have. If it shall be at Oblique Angles, as the Line A B unto the Wall B C, I do note that in re∣spect to the Wall B C, there are in the <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a right triangle and a wall</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> Line of the Project A B, two Motions com∣pounded together: that is, one of approxi∣mation perpendicular to the Wall, the other of passage lateral, or parallel to the same. The perpendicular Motion is both repre∣sented and measured by the Line A C; the parallel Motion by the Line C B: for both the Spaces A C and C B are passed by the Ball at the self same Time.</P>
<P>Now observe, that of these two sorts of <HI>Impetus,</HI> one onely is to the purpose, for encreasing the Forces to make a breach in the Wall, and to drive the Ball into it; to wit, the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the perpendicular La∣tion A C. Th' other, although it were infinite, will never encrease the force of the Project against the Resistance of the Wall,
<PB N="24" REF="86"/> unless the perpendicular Lation be withall accelerated. Nay, if the Horizontal Motion were simple and alone, without any mixture with the perpendicular Motion, what other would the Ball do but run equi-distant unto the Wall, without ever touching it, so far would it be from breaking it; although it were a very thin Glass? When therefore, the Direction of any Projection being given, we shall know how much of this perpendicular <HI>Impotus</HI> entereth into the Composition of the Motion, we shall also know the Activity or Moment of the Project towards the Resistance of the opposite Wall.</P>
<P>Let the Line of any Incidence at pleasure be A B upon the Plane B F taken with any what-ever Inclination: but withall, let the portion A B be so small, that it may be taken for Right. Draw <FIGURE>

<HEAD>OF THE Swiftness OF SOUND.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The swiftness of Sound is greater than the swiftness of Bullets shot off, and finishes 230 fathon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the space of one second minute.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hosoever would try the swiftness of Sounds by night, and by day, either in valleys, woods, or mountains, either with or against the wind, or when it is rainy or fair weather, shall find in all respects as I have tried it, that there will be alwayes the same swiftness of Sound.</P>
<P>But after that you have searched out a second by 230 fa∣thoms, he that shoots off a lesser Gun, may again retire 230 fathoms, so that he may be gone back from you 460 fathoms, the same or the like Sound in passing over that way will spend two seconds; which when it shall be five times multiplied by us, that we should hear the Sound 1150 fathoms, the flash by night breaking forth from the mouth of the Gun is alwayes seen at that distance be∣fore the Sound is heard five seconds of time. And seeing we make a <HI>French</HI> league to be 2500 fathoms, and the circuit of the Earth 7200, of such leagues, you may easily conclude in what time the sound does pass over one whole or several leagues, for the swiftness of the sound is not diminished by its debility, whenas the last part of the Sound that may be heard does emulate the swiftness of the first.</P>
<P>The Sound of the Gun therefore will pass over a league in the space of 11 se∣conds, seeing a league contains 11 times 230 fathoms (the space passed over in a se∣cond minute) less onely by 30 fathoms, which are here scarce worth considera∣tion, because that they are passed over by the Sound in the seventh part of a second.</P>
<PB N="64" REF="89"/>
<P>From which many things may be gathered; first, that a Souldier attentive my de∣cline or shun the shot of a Gun at one hundred fathoms, is he foresaw the flash of it; which I thus demonstrate: It is evident from observation, that a Bullet in flying 100 fathoms does at the least spend a second of time, and the Sound of it in passing of them does at the most spend but half a second. Therefore the Souldier from the fire seen (if Vision can be in an instant) hath a whole second wherein he my easily go three or four paces before that the bullet can fly so far; also there remains to him half a second from that point of time in which he hears the Sound, until the coming of the Bullet: although I would not advise any one to try that, unless he first fortifie himself with a shield, helmet, and all other kind of Armour, that he may be out of all danger. But any one may try it behind a wall, to which the Sound will come be∣fore the Bullet.</P>
<P>Secondly, from the Sound and fire observed, may be known how much the Guns are distant that are shot off against the besieged, or besiegers, even as to the in∣genious Gunners there will not be wanting matter to promote their Art.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by hearing the Sound of Thunder, and seeing the lightning go before may be known how far it is off, so that if the Thunder be not changed from the place where the lightning was seen; for how many seconds (whether measured by the pulse, which exactly continues a second, or by a Pendulum or any other Watch) there are between the Lightning and the Sound, so many 230 fathoms are to be reckoned; so that if you number five seconds it may be distant from you half a league; if ten seconds a whole league, whether the distance shall be upright, or side∣wayes and oblique, for it matters nothing.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If by the turnings and windings or Circles in the air a sound in the same manner may be considered, and caused, as we see circles extende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the water struck with the finger or a little stone, as all almost believe, and if from the swiftness of bo∣dies in like manner moved we my ghess at their crassitude, thickness and weight, we may say that water is 1380 times thicker and heavier than air; for as much as the Semidiameter of Circles of the Water in any manner struck, which is made in a second of time, scarce exceeds a foot, in which time the semidi∣amiter of Circles in the air, made also by any percussion is 1380 foot, that is 230 fa∣thoms; which proportion of gravities come very near to observations by him men∣tioned. There is yet one thing that may cause some doubt, which is, that the Sound of greater Guns moves more slowly than of lesser, whereas our Geometer in the siege at <HI>Theodonis</HI> observed that their Sound was heard, from the fire seen, after thirteen or fourteen seconds of time, when yet he was scarce half a league distant from those Guns; And the Sound according to that which hath been before said, may pass over a whole league and more in that time: Wherefore the Sound of those Guns doth seem to be different from that of lesser Guns.</P>
<P>The Author having by this discourse argued that the Sound of Guns is heard at the distance of above 16 miles a minute (which is almost as swift as the <HI>Copernicans</HI> suppose the Earth to move in its diurnal revolution about its Axis) it was thought fit to subjoyn hereto the Authors latter thoughts of the same Argument, published three years after.</P>

<PB N="65" REF="89"/>
<HEAD>OF THE SWIFTNESS OF SOUND, And force of Bullets shot out of Guns.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I have oftentimes considered that the Sound passes over 230 fathoms in the time of a 2d or sixtieth part of a minute; and that there seem to arise someed doubt, whether there should be that Swiftness of the Sound of greater Guns, as there is of lesser, with which I tried; at length it was ob∣served that in the space of eleven seconds, the Sound of the greater Guns of the Kings Armory, have passed from the same Armory, after the flash was seen, as far as our house, or the <HI>Vicennian</HI> Con∣vent, whilst for obtaining the surrender of <HI>Pouploon</HI> the Guns were shot off by night.</P>
<P>But when with a fathom I found that it was 3524 fathoms from Port Saint <HI>Anthony</HI> to the gate of the aforesaid Convent, where the ear was, and to the wall of the <HI>Vicennian</HI> Castle first meeting it, near 2500 fathoms, 'tis certain first that it is a just league of 2500 fathoms from the Garden walk of the Armoty, from whence the Guns are wont to be shot off, to that Castle: for if any thing in the passage must be dimi∣nished that distance will well enough equal it, whereby the corner of the Garden is more distant, or the walk by <HI>Sequana</HI> nearer from the Castle, than Port Saint <HI>An∣thony.</HI></P>
<P>It is evident therefore that the Sound runs over more than 230 Fathoms in each second, to wit, 320 in every second, which make 1920 foot; which since any one can prove by his own experiments, I need not say more thereof.</P>
<P>But some may imagine that hence perhaps must be concluded that greater Sounds pass more swiftly, which disagrees with divers observations. But when sometimes these experiments shall be repeated, that I may number the seconds, I shall advertise, for as much as I conjecture that there is no swiftness of sound greater than that, which I have proved of 230 fathoms for a second; for in these small matters I do not ap∣prove that common saying, He that acts by another, seems to act by himself; who want not opportunities may observe for their own satisfaction.</P>
<P>But now we shall add some thing concerning the swiftness of Bullets shot out of Guns. When therefore at the Marquesse of <HI>Doraisons</HI> four leagues from the <HI>Sexti∣an</HI> waters, I commanded a Brasse Gun nine foot long, whose name was the <HI>Marchioness,</HI> commonly called <HI>la Marquise,</HI> (whose Bullet was two pounds and an ounce, but quantity of Powder, such as is wont to be in the use of lesser Guns, the weight of one pound) to be levelled horizontally, with a plum line I found that the Bullet shot off Horizonitally, in the time of five seconds had passed over 630 fathoms or 3780 foot, and had reached the horizon, or fell to the ground, as was evident by the huge quantity of dust raised by the blow.</P>
<P>Moreover that point of Earth which was first struck by the Bullet was depressed under the horizon of the Gun 27 fathoms, for otherwise the Range should not have been so great before its fall to the earth, which meets so much the more slow∣ly by how much it is the more depressed under the Horizon of the Gun shot off, and I presume I have attributed a lesser swiftness to the Guns than is just, unless yet
<PB N="66" REF="90"/> the Bullets of the greater Guns shot off with very fine powder, which we used, may exceed the swiftness of Bullets shot from Harquebuzes; of which thing I do not yet pass judgement, till experiment, shall bring some further evidence: but I shall pro∣pound some things newly observed.</P>
<P>Now therefore of the Bullet which I made trial of, I affirm that the swiftness was so great that, at least, in each second minute it could pass over 126 fa∣thoms.</P>
<P>I said, at least, because the observers know that the force on the Bullet doth go before the excussion or flash of the powder, and the perceiving thereof; so that half a second may well be attributed to this time. Moreover in the first second the Bullet passes more swiftly, in which time I doubt not but it passes over 150 fathoms; Lastly, if by reason of that tarrying which. happens betwen the smiting of the Earth until the dust is seen to rise, we should augment that swiftness by so many fa∣thoms as it could pass over in half a minute, to wit 70, and that the swiftness be sup∣posed almost equal for the time of five seconds, and in each second of that time that it passes over 140 fathoms, that is, if the point of the Earth first struck were 700 fa∣thoms distant from the Gun, it would reach it in the time of five seconds. Then the swiftness of the Bullet may be determined from what hath been said, to be 130 fa∣thoms, at least, in the time of a second: which also agrees with the experiments of Bullets shot from lesser Guns: to wit, they pass an hundred fathoms in the same time as the Sound of the Gun hath the same passage.</P>
<P>For if, behind a wall that is to be struck by the Bullet, the ear be attentive, in the same instant the sound and the percussion of the Bullet is heard, as if the very Bullet had caused that Sound; which doubtless you shall find to be true as I did if you try: although it will be worth the labour to prove it, not only with that most refined powder, which they are wont to use who shoot at a mark for a wager, but also with the courser sort of Powder for great Guns, that it may be observed whether it causes any sensible difference of the swiftness.</P>
<P>Whatsoever powder you use, the least swiftness of the Bullet, may be defined in the first second an hundred, the greatest 150 fathoms, if you but so much Pow∣der into the Gun as is necessary for a good shot; for if you put in but a few grains which can scarce shoot the Bullet off, another thing. is to be said.</P>
<P>I add that a Bullet shot vertically or Perpendicularly upright from the aforesaid Gun in its ascent and descent, spends 36 seconds: which if it spend so much time in its Rise as in its fall, and that a heavy body descending in the time of 18 seconds alwayes keeps the same proportion in hastening its descent which it keeps in the four first seconds, the Vertical ascent shall be 648 fathoms, forasmuch as a Bullet of six pound Weight of that Gun, which the Illustrious Knight <HI>Hugenius</HI> caused to be shot off at the <HI>Hague</HI> upon my request, in its ascent in the time of 16 seconds passed over 512 fathoms, which falling, pierced three foot into the Earth.</P>
<P>But two things there are which may lessen the space of the ascent; first, that per∣haps the bullet may not spend so much time in its ascent as in its descent, because Ar∣rows in ascending pass over the same way in three seconds of time that in descend∣ing they do in five seconds: furthermore should we imagine to shoot with the mouth of the Gun towards the Earth, the Bullet would pierce deeper into the Earth, than by its mere fall, as it happens in Arrows: whence there arises in me no small suspicion that the eyes in the ascent of the Bullet are deceived, to wit that the Bullet was even falling when it was yet esteemed to ascend: which also may be imagined of Arrows, which perhaps had began to descend when they should seem to be inverted, that the point which went before ascending should likewise descending antecede: which you may conclude of from the small blow of the Bullet descending, unless you may contend that the stroke made by the Bullet shot upright from the mouth of the Gun and falling upon the Earth very near, is greater indeed than the stroke of the same Bullet shot from the greatest height, and that not by reason of the greater swiftness, but by reason of the air so unawares intercepted and oppressed, that it may much
<PB N="67" REF="90"/> better turn over or bore through the Earth, than when it is prepared for the last motion by the Bullet falling slowly.</P>
<P>Which indeed can be known by Rocks and Mountains 600 fathoms high, to wit, one standing on the top shall observe what time the Bullet that is shot off at the foot of the Mountain, shall spend in coming to the top or any other place of the Mountain, and a fign being given shall warn the leveller of the Gun of the time, or from it shall learn the time of the ascent and descent: from which cutting off the time of the ascent shall conclude how much shorter it shall be in the time of the descent; which also may be observed by an iron Bullet red-hot shot off in the night, whilst it can be seen light to the greatest height: how∣ever it is I think fit to add the observation of that Holland Gun, which being levelly or horizontally shot off, carried a Bullet of six pounds 398 paces, before it first touched the Earth, taking a pace for three foot; after this Space it made eight leaps, and at length it ceased at 1750 paces: we have here expressed the distance between each leap, as likewise the distance of each grazing from the Gun.</P>

<P>Moreover a middle range of 45 degrees was 3225 paces, whose half if we take it for an upright or vertical shot, will be 3225 foot, or 537 ½ fathoms, for which before we counted only 512. Hence it comes to pass that we may judge that a vertical shot in the ascent doth not proceed by the same or equal and proportionable degrees of swift∣ness, by which it falls in its descent, for at least there are wanting 25 fathoms, by which 512 differ from 537, although that way of him that levelled the Gun, in counting by common paces, restrained to no rule, cannot be so certain, but that the other may differ from it, so that it cannot with undoubted certainty be reduced to our defined fa∣thoms.</P>
<P>Whoever therefore would certainly try, let him have a chain or wheel for counting of fathoms or any other determinate measures, as is done in the passage of the league of 2500 fathoms from the <HI>Bastilian</HI> Tower erected right over against Port Saint <HI>Anthony</HI> as for as the walls of the <HI>Vicennian</HI> Castle that first meet.</P>
<P>There remaines one thing that may diminish the upright height, to wit, that the Bullet spends more seconds in the descent than it ought, after it comes to the point of equality, after which it doth not any more augment its own swiftness: so that not only 16 seconds are to be reckoned for the descent of the Holland Bullet, but per∣haps 20, and 12 are to be counted for the ascent.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="91"/>
<P>For although in moderate heights of 40 or 50 fathoms, the access to the point of equality, in leaden Bullets may not be sufficiently observed, it does not thence follow that it comes not to such a point, in greater heights of an hundred or more fathoms; yea experience proveth the Contrary.</P>
<P>Let there be taken a Corken. Bullet which is at least 70 times lighter than a leaden one, yet both them almost in the same time make a three foot space, although per∣haps the Corke attains its point of equality within 50 foot.</P>
<P>But whether a leaden Bullet 70 times heavier, can pass over a seventy fold space, that is, 3500 foot, before it comes to its point of equality, which little differs from the height to which Bullets arrive that are vertically shot out of Guns, although I can∣not yet conclude, yet it seemes probable enough to me. Moreover the force will never be augmented after the arival at that point, if the greater force shall be ar∣gued from only the greater swiftness. But note, it hath been observed by a Noble man who related it to me, that a field Gun 18 foot long, and cut shorter foot by foot, did alwaies curry its shott the further till it came to be eleven foot long, and then it be∣gan not to give so great a Range.</P>
<P>To which may be added from the experience of some in small Guns, that if it be over charged with Powder, part of the Powder will blow out of the Gun without firing. Morever if the Bullet be not quite remmed home it will pierce the further, and the Gun recoyle the more.</P>
<P>Also that where the Gun is found most to furr with many shootings off with Powder, there it ought to be cut off, the remainder being the proper length requisite.</P>
<P>It hath been related that a ship becalmed and tormented with the Cushee Piece of a Galley, that lay in a manner out of shot, was at the last reached by the industry of a Mariner, who wrapping up a much lesser sized Bullet than the Bore of the Gun made use of required, in a good Wad did shoot as far as the Galley, thereby retaliating the Injury received.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Depression of shot below the Marke.</HEAD>
<P>I Have often took care that a Gun should be shot off commonly called an Har∣quebuz, at the space of an hundred fathoms from the mark, that is, six hun∣dred foot, which make three hundred common paces, and found that the Bullet was depressed under the mark-line eight or ten foot, which would scarce have made a greater space, if it had fallen perpendicularly down at the same moment of time it was left off.</P>
<P>Again at the the Marquess of <HI>Doraisons,</HI> a Bullet shot off, in the space of five seconds of time fell 27 fathoms beneath its horizontal line or marke; and whereas perchance the rising of the dust, and the perceiving of it might make us lose a second of time, and that we retain only four seconds, then in each second the Bullet should be carried 157 ½ fathoms (surely not more) yet it ought to have descended 32 fathoms, if it descends so much horizontally shot off as it would naturally fall were it not shot off, and therefore it either loses some thing of its descent by reason of its being shot off, or in running 360 fathoms, it spends not so much as four whole seconds of time, but rather about 3 ¾.</P>
<P>We add that something is by this means abated from the swiftness of the fall for the space of 27 fathoms which the Bullet in shooting off did descend, or fall below the marke: so that all things considered, I would not as yet start from that opinion, which holds that two heavy bodies, to wit, two Bullets, whereof one may fall perpendi∣cularly from its place above the Horizon, and the other be forc∣ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of this there is a contro∣versie between</HI> Borel∣lius <HI>who published a Treatise</HI> de vi percus∣sionis, <HI>the which was writ against by</HI> Ho∣norato Fabri <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Dialogues of Motion.</HI></NOTE> horizontaly, shall both in the same moment of time arrive at the ground or Horizon: for example, if the pit of the aforesaid <HI>Marquess</HI> be 27 fathoms deep, as indeed it is, if I rightly remem∣ber, or also a little deeper, 32. a Bullet shot into the fields inclosed between the Sextian waters, will hit the horizon, the same mo∣ment,
<PB N="69" REF="91"/> that the like Bullet falling, shall the superiour superfice of the aforesaid point of the water.</P>
<P>There is another thing that I may suspect, whether or no the surveyour hath ac∣curately enough measured the horizontal depression; however it be, you see with what difficulties experiments are hedged in, and how much natural knowledge is in∣debted to them, who are enriching the same with exact Observations.</P>
<P>But note that the air that meets the bullet that is shot off does so much hinder or diminish its motion, as much as a wind of the same swiftness with the Ball, blowing con∣tinually against the same in a vacuum.</P>
<P>For is it not the same impediment, or destruction of the same force, if the bullet beats the aire or is beaten of it? But when I said it was known by experience, that water does so much the more descend, by how much the slower it moves horizontally, and the same may seem to be concluded of other projected heavie bodies; I advertise that observations are not yet made so exact as that any thing of this nature should be too positively asserted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Impediment of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>IN regard that Bullets shot from Guns do about the end of their motion utter a more vehement noise or hissing than about the middle or onwards; there is no doubt to be made but that they move more slowly, and the force decreasing as the swiftness, <HI>Mersennus</HI> concludes that the Curved range line described by a Bullets mo∣tion cannot exactly describe a Parabola, but however the Theory is tolerable, admit∣ing the first violence to move in the touch line of a Parobola, and it is likely the grea∣ter Mountures cause the greatest difference, because, there is so much the more Air beaten and removed by the passage of the shot.</P>
<P>But yet it is most hard to find out, how much the Air hinders; for although it seems to hinder so much, as the wind agitating the air with the same swiftness, strikes upon the Bullet shot off; yet we are Ignorant of the force of that wind compared with the force of the Bullet shot off; unless we may appeale to our other experiments in which is shewn that the air is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> least a thousand times lighter than water: and sccing that a leaden Bullet is eleven times heavier than water of the same bulke, a leaden Bullet will exceed the weight of the air 11000 times: and therefore the air agitated by the same swiftness of the Bullet, meeting with the bul∣let, seems to take away the 1100 part of the swiftness from the Bullet shot off.</P>
<P>Which impediment truly is so light, that in the description of the Parabole it scarce ought to be considered.</P>
<P>Those things are very excellent which the famous <HI>Torricellius</HI> hath set forth in his approved Treatise, to which <HI>Mersennus</HI> referrs his Reader.</P>

<P>WHenas I made trial about the shooting of Bullets in Guns only of an indif∣ferent bigness (which we commonly call Harquebuzes) which in the ascent and descent together spend 22, 23 or 24 Seconds of time, <HI>Peter Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il</HI> a man most skilful and accurate in observations whilest he lived at <HI>Francopolis,</HI> found (at my request) the Range of a shot, out of a great gun, at the elevation of 22 degrees, whose iron Bullet weighed 33 pounds and ⅓, to be 1900 fathoms, which the Bullet flew or passed over in the space of 20, 21 or 22 seconds; the Gun being placed at 8 fathoms in the Castle above ground or Horizon; from which place a Bullet of 12 pounds which so many pounds of gun-pouder shot off at the elevation of 16 de∣grees above the horizon, spent in the air 16 seconds.</P>
<P>Besides, a Culverine of 12 foot long and horizontally levelled being 6 fathom high above the Horizon of the ocean and shot off, the Bullet, whose diameter was almost five Inches, continued 8 seconds of time in the air; when yet another Bullet whose diame∣ter was 6 Inches and 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, also horizontally shot off out of an other Gun 12 foot and ½ long, spent only 6 seconds in the air; another Gun shot off at the Elevation of 15 de∣grees, its Bullet spent 24 seconds in the Air.</P>
<P>An Iron Culverine of 10 foot long, whose Bullet, had a diameter of almost four inches, horizontally l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>velled, and standing 9 fathoms above the surface or brim of the Sea, spent only three seconds, in Its horizontal Range, after which grazing five times above the Ocean, spent four other seconds.</P>
<P>Three daies also before the taking of <HI>Theoud, Robervallus</HI> our Geometer observed, the Bullets of Guns shot off from the City against our Souldiers, for the most part to spend only 14 seconds of time in the air, after which there was a hissing increased more and more until the force and motion of the Bullet was almost quite extin∣guished, and that after the shot had flew almost half a league.</P>
<P>Which being supposed it may be Theorically concluded, how great the shoots ought to be at whatsoever elevation above the horizon, if they be in such Proportion one to another, as shots in a Vacuity, no Medium hindring; that is, for example, if the range of 45 degrees be double the height of the Perpendicular or vertical shot in a space not hindring, so is the range of 45 in the air to the vertical in the air, and so of the rest; which observations only will teach; which yet are most difficult in the greater sort of Guns or Bows, especially the perpendicular, whose height we can scarce certainly know, unless some rock might be found high enough, to whose top, or some certain place, the Bullet or Arrow may come, the height of which top or place we may after∣wards measure.</P>
<P>No Towers surely are high enough; and by the time of the descent or fall of the Bullet, to conclude a place may be found to which bullets, darts, or other things that are cast upright or vertically ascending, do come, doth therefore fail, because they do not observe the same rule of swiftness in descending; as is evident from darts, to which seeing it happens in their ascent or rise of 50 fathoms to be slackned in their descent or fall, something like this may be also thought to happen to Bullets, to wit, when they de∣scend from the height of a thousand fathoms.</P>
<P>But you may avoid these difficulties: for if from that rock in the <HI>Dolphinate,</HI> whose
<PB N="71" REF="92"/> height 'tis said is 600 fathoms or more, a stone or bullet of Iron or any other matter be let f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, * the time of its falling being noted, as for example, if in the space of 18 seconds it fall from the height of 648 fathoms (as <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Experiments of this kind the Reader will doubtless find, as also others about</HI> Pendu∣lums <HI>in the</HI> Opuscula Posthuma <HI>of</HI> 1. Bap. Batiani.</NOTE> truly it should fall, if the spaces be in Duplicate <HI>ratio,</HI> or as the square of the times in the whole descent) then we have rightly judged before of the vertical altitude or perpendicular shot (which the Bullet of an indifferent Gun reaches) that is the height of 288 fathoms; which yet I cannot credit; otherwise the middle shot or range of 45 degrees of that Gun at least would be double to that perpendicular or vertical one, that is to say, it would be 576 fathoms, whenas I found it not 400 fathoms.</P>
<P>Besides these observations I shall add those which the industrious <HI>Galeus</HI> an Engineer to divers D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes in whose presence he made them, writ with his own hand and gave me, which that you may more easily understand, let the greater Gun K, which we commonly call a Cannon, be parallel to the Horizon, and let the eye be taking aim by the points I and O, the horizontal shot being supposed O P, or in the figure beneath, S X, or, T V, he sayes that the remainder of the rang which bends till it touches the horizon in the point Λ, is almost equal to the horizontal shot, that is, that there is almost as much space made by the bullet from that point, from which it begins to bend towards the horizon, un til it touch it, as it had made before the bend∣ing of it.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various angles and parabolas</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>But now let us suppose that horizontal shot O P, or T V, removed to the lower figure in which let A B be the horizontal plain, and let the the aforsaid horizontal shot be A I, <HI>Galeus</HI> contends that the middle range of 45 degrees, which is the longest of all, is eleven fold the length of the horizontal shot O P, or A I: And in those Guns which are half the weight of the foregoing greater Guns, to be in respect of A I, as 10 and ½ is to 1, and in lesser Guns as 10 to 1 that is our figure, as A B in re∣spect of A I; in which the middle range is A G E B; for that is the middle range
<PB N="72" REF="93"/> which passes through the middle of the quadrant Φ 5, which they call the sixth point, because it is the middle part of the half circumference A, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, divided into 12 equal parts; which joynd to the quadrant Φ 5, may be useful for levelling the gun at any elevation above the horizon, if it shall be divided not only into 12 parts, but also into an 180 degrees.</P>
<P>And hence he concludes that the dead or exact Horizontal Shot or range, that is in the figure, R Λ I to be in Proportion to the middle range as 1 to 6; or in lesser Guns, as one to five; which dead Horizontal ranges is to the range of an Elevationof one de∣gree, as five to six, or more exactly as 55 to 67, or as 14 to 17.</P>
<P>But when the recoyling of the greater Gun is hindred, the dead Horizontal range will be greater by a seventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth part, than that range which is made with recoyling; in lesser Guns it will be a twelfth or a fifteenth part less.</P>
<P>Moreover he asserts that the middle range A 6 E does proceed righton without arching by the line A G, which may be almost equal to A 5, that is, almost 5 fold or 4 ½ the Hori∣zontal shot: then not only that it does ascend to the point D, so that the greatest height of the middle range may be fourfold the Horizontal, and be over the line A C six∣fold the same which some affirm; but he by observation saies is false against <HI>Tartaglia;</HI> affirming that the greatest altitude must be F E, answering the point 7, that is seven distances of Horizontal range from the gun A, that F E may be almost five fold the Ho∣rizontal-range.</P>
<P><HI>Galeus</HI> did likewise well conjecture that the Curve for the middle range does come near to the Curve of an hyperbolical or parabolical line, and that not by force of reason, but only from observations. Moreover the greatest range at forty five degrees elevation he makes 16200 foot, that is 2700 of the <HI>French</HI> fathoms; who because he used feet less than ours, you might account it for 2500 fathoms, that the said range may answer to our league, and that the bullet might pass through the air in near half a minute, or 30 seconds of time: and because the dead Horizontal range may be 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the utmost, it will be 2700 foot or 450 fathoms, which be∣ing supposed the Horizontal range will scarce exceed 200 fathoms.</P>
<P><HI>Mersennus</HI> in this place hath published a table of ranges made by the said <HI>Galeus,</HI> but it being apprehended that the same is not so near the truth as that of <HI>Torricellio,</HI> or a∣nother here published in <HI>English</HI> by the antient well known Teacher of the Mathe∣maticks Mr. <HI>Henry Bond;</HI> that the same may be preserved and become more common in use we have inserted the same.</P>

<HEAD>The Ranges of Spouts or Squirts compared with the Ranges of Bullets shot out of Guns.</HEAD>
<P>FOr as much as a Bullet spends a greater time in its fall than its rise, like darts; or the descent is not so swift, that it should always hasten in that degree where∣by in three or four seconds, we have found its swiftness to be increased, which I suppose to be confirmed from this reason, because a bullet descending cannot have so great a power to smite, as it hath ascending, so that approaching the Earth it is not so swiftly moved, as when it comes from the mouth of the Gun, for when the swiftness of any thing projected is equall, it equally strikes.</P>
<P>Therefore I account Spouts useful, seeing they bring us to the knowledg of shooting, of which otherwise we could not judge, by reason of the difficulty of trial which is most easily discerned in tubes: for because any one may compare in a little time what ever shot he pleases with another, to wit, a middle Range <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Former Figure.</HI></NOTE> with a vertical, or Perpendicular one as to time and height, that this may be the better understood, in the following figure let the Cock be A above the Horizon A B, and let the altitude of the tube be A 12, whose vertical Squirt is A Φ, Experience teacheth us that the length of the middle Squirt A B, is double to the Ver∣tical A Φ.</P>
<P>But to what height the middle Squirt ranges, whether to D or E, which also you may understand of Bullets shot from Guns, there is none hitherto hath observed: but it is one half of the vertical Φ A, wherefore the point D or E is higher than it ought to be, and whatever is said by the ingenious, may be corrected by spouts.</P>
<P>There are other things also that want inquiry into; for example, how it can come to pass, that a bullet shot out of the mouth of a Gun from O to P comes right on, when in that time it flying along the line O P a hundred fathoms ought to fall to∣wards the center of the Earth 12 foot, if the horizontal motion of a thing violently projected hinders not its natural motion, as many imagine in a vacuity or place that does not impede.</P>
<P>For although that can partly be explained by the diversity of the lines, which is sound in Guns, to wit the line R X Y, which follows the outside of the Gun, and that which they call <HI>Linea animae</HI> S Z, which passes thorough the axis of the hollow M N to the aforesaid side, is in no wise parallel: because, to wit, the bullet K or H levelling at L may ascend to the side line I L, or the point S passing to Z may ascend to the point X of the side line R Y: yet another thing is to be added, when what is afore∣said is not true, when the eye of the shooter takes not aim by the line I L or R X but by the line M N or S X: for then the bullet K does not descend so much, as it would if it were left to it self in the air.</P>
<P>Add, that the water out of the Cock fitted to the Horizontal Squirt doth not de∣scend so much, as it would if left to it self; for it is manifest by Experience, that the Horizontal Squirt of 30 foot, which continues two seconds, descends not so much as eight foot, when according to the law of bodies of equal weight, it should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or at least by reason of the resistance of the air breaking the water it ought to descord 30 foot.</P>
