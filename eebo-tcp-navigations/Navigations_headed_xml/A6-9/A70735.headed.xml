<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ince it pleased Divine Providence, by Your Ma∣jesties sole Conduct and Direction, to Compose all Foreign Differences, setling at last Your weary People, Harrased with Fire and Pestilence, under a Necessary and Honourable Peace.</P>
<P>The Effects of which, soon Chearing up Your Loyal Subjects, they, laying Arms aside, straight betook themselves to the several Improvements of Arts and Sciences, each stri∣ving to outvie the other, in what seemed most Conducible to the Restaura∣tion of the former Wealth, Splendor, and Reputation of these Your Ma∣jesties Kingdoms, Renown'd and Famous through the World.</P>
<P>But amongst these Busie Preparations, no Work appears more Per∣spicuous than that Stupendious Miracle! the Raising from a Confused Heap of Ruines (sooner than some believ'd they could remove the Rub∣bish) Your Imperial City, already looking down, though Private Houses,
<PB REF="6"/>upon former Publick Structures, hereafter to be the Business of Foreign Nations to See and Wonder at.</P>
<P>I also, Dread Soveraign, feeling a Spring of Youthful Vigour, warming my Veins with fresh Hopes of better Times, have under∣taken, according to my Mean Abilities, no small Business, a Work of Time, requiring some Years to Publish, being, May it please Your Majesty, a New Model of the Ʋniverse, an <HI>English Atlas,</HI> or the setting forth, in our Native Dress, and Modern Language, an Accurate Description of all the Kingdoms and Dominions in the Four Regions thereof.</P>
<P>Since such, and so great an Off-spring cannot be Born in a day, nor see the light of Publication at once, being several and distinct Volumns, this my first Issue, Most Gracious Sir, being <HI>Africa</HI> Compleat, in the Name of the Rest yet Ʋnfinish'd, I humbly Dedi∣cate and Tender to Your most Serene Majesty, as an Earnest and Re∣presentative of the whole Work.</P>
<P>In which, Dread Sir, You may behold amidst a Gallaxy of Southern Constellations, or the numerous Flourishing Cities and Seats of that famous Region, Your own Bright Star, none of the smallest Mag∣nitude, Your Metropolis, Your Royal City <HI>Tangier,</HI> which Seated on the Skirts of the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> keeps the Keys both of the Ocean and In-Land Sea, whose unparallell'd Scituation, Temperature of Air, and Fertility of Soil, may well make the Story True, if Romance, that an antient Emperor resolv'd to fix there his Imperial Seat, to be his Terrestrial Paradice, Invironing with Walls of Brass, a Gold and Sil∣ver City.</P>
<P>Thus Prostrating at Your Sacred Feet, that which if Your Majesty be pleased to receive with a Smile, Your Subjects through Your <HI>Brittish Monarchy,</HI> not onely Ambitious in obeying Your Commands, but ready to follow, in what they may, Your Royal Example, will give the Work also a Civil Reception.</P>
<P>Whilest I, Dread Soveraign, to clear all difficulties, am busie ex∣ploding Old Tales, Fictions, and Hear-says of the Antients, Collect∣ing and Translating better and more Modern Authority, especially Eye∣witnesses, our late Sea Voyagers, that I might not weary Your Sacred Ears with any thing, if possible, but undoubted Truth, May Your Majesty, though Your Claim be Just, and Your Sword able to Intitle You Emperor of the Ʋniverse, Your Thundring Soverdigns already

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Ntering upon so great a Work, being no small Concern in my Territory of Business, I sup∣pose it proper, never Apologizing hereto∣fore, by way of Preface, to give you a brief Review of all my former Endeavors, so lead∣ing you on to this present Occasion.</P>
<P>Many years are past with various Revoluti∣ons, since in the first Fluctuations of the late Grand Rebellion, I being left at leisure from former Imployments belonging to the quiet of Peace wherein I was bred, in stead of Arms, to which in parties most began to buckle, I betook my self to something of <HI>Literature,</HI> in which, till then, altogether a Stran∣ger; And drawing towards the Evening of my Age, I made a lit∣tle Progress, bending my self to softer Studies, adapted to my Abi∣lities and Inclinations, <HI>Poesie:</HI> And first Rallying my new rais'd Forces, a small and inconsiderable parcel of <HI>Latin,</HI> I undertook no less a Conquest, than the Reducing into our Native Language; the Great Master and Grand Improver of that Tongue, <HI>Vir∣gil,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Roman</HI> Poets; and though I fell much short in this my vain Enterprise, yet such, and so happy prov'd the Versi∣on, and so fairly accepted, that of me, till then obscure, <HI>Fame</HI> be∣gan to prattle, and soon after I, forsooth, stood forth a new <HI>Author,</HI> and so much cheer'd up with fresh Encouragements, that from a <HI>Mean Octavo,</HI> a <HI>Royal Folio</HI> Flourish'd, Adorn'd with Sculp∣ture, and Illustrated with Annotations, Triumphing with the affixt Emblazons, Names, and Titles of a hundred <HI>Patrons,</HI> all bold As∣sertors in Vindication of the Work, which (what e're my Deserts) being Publish'd with that Magnificence and Splendor, appear'd a new, and taking Beauty, the fairest that till then the <HI>English</HI> Press ever boasted.</P>
<P>Yet this first Endeavour rais'd my Reputation no farther, than to be accounted a Good <HI>Translator,</HI> a Faithful <HI>Interpreter,</HI> one that had dabled well in anothers <HI>Helicon;</HI> but I, greedy of more,
<PB REF="8"/>having tasted the sweetness of a little Fame, would not thus sit down, but ambitious to try my own Wing, endeavor'd to Sore a little higher. The most Antient and Wisest of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Sages, who first led us through a Vocal Forest, where Beasts also spake, and Birds sat Chanting in every Tree, Notes for Men to follow: <HI>Aesop</HI> the Prince of <HI>Mythologists</HI> became my Quarry, on his plain Song I Descanted, on his short and pithy Sayings, Paraphras'd, raising my voice to such a height, that I took my degree amongst the <HI>Minor Poets.</HI></P>
<P>My next Expedition with Sails a Trip, and swoln with the Breath of a general Applause, was to discover <HI>Greece,</HI> that there, I might from <HI>Homers</HI> own hand, the King of <HI>Pernassus,</HI> receive plentifully at the Fountain-Head staining Draughts of the brisker <HI>Hypocreen;</HI> in which I had a double Design, not onely to bring over so Antient and Famous an Author, but to inable my self the better to carry on an <HI>Epick Poem</HI> of my own Composure; whose <HI>Iliads</HI> with much Cost and Labor at last finishing, being Dedicated to His Sacred Majesty, and Crown'd with His Gracious Acceptance, I main∣tain'd my Post, loosing no ground of former Reputation.</P>
<P>Soon after, being order'd by the <HI>Commission of Triumphs,</HI> to Ban∣quet His Majesty at the Cities cost with a <HI>Poetick Entertainment,</HI> Marching with His Train of Nobles through His Imperial Cham∣ber to His Corronation at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the Argument being great, seeming almost impossible to set forth the Dear Affections, and un∣expressible Joys of all His Loyal Subjects, especially of His <HI>Metro∣polis London,</HI> at His so Happy Restauration; and that the Glory of so Bright a Day, the most Splendid that e're this Nation saw, should not close with the Setting-Sun, but appear a shining Tro∣phy to Posterity; I, at my own proper Cost and Pains, brought it to light once more, in a <HI>Royal Folio,</HI> containing the whole Solem∣nity, the Triumphal Arches and <HI>Cavalcade,</HI> delineated in Sculpture, the Speeches and Impresses Illustrated from Antiquity, and Dedi∣cated to His Majesty; of which, some, and but a few, escaping the late Conflagration, remain'd.</P>
<P>But whilst I busied my self thus, neither sparing Cost nor Pains, to dress and set forth my own Volumns with all the Splendor and Ostentation that could be, I thought it also Religious, and the part of a good Christian, to do something for Gods sake, to adorn in like manner, with Ornamental Accomplishments, the <HI>Holy Bi∣ble,</HI> which by my own sole Conduct, proper Cost and Charges, at last appear'd the largest and fairest Edition that was ever yet set forth in any Vulgar Tongue.</P>
<P>Next in order to the compleating of <HI>Homer,</HI> I fell upon his <HI>Odis∣ses,</HI> which Dedicated to his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> then His Majesties Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to whom, in that Kingdom, in the late miserable Distractions, I was a Servant, he kindly accept∣ing thereof.</P>
<PB REF="8"/>
<P>Then, being restless, though weary of tedious Versions, and such long Journeys in Translating Greek and Latin Poets, Works asking no less than a Mans whole life to accomplish, I, the better to feed my Fancy with variety of Objects, a second time betook my self to <HI>Aesop,</HI> where I found such Success, that soon I seem'd to tread Air, and walk alone, becoming also a <HI>Mytholo∣gist;</HI> not onely Paraphrasing, but a Designer of my own Fables, and at last screw'd my self up to a greater height, finishing two He∣roick Poems, <HI>viz. The Ephesian Matron,</HI> and <HI>The Roman Slave,</HI> which Volumn, a most Worthy and Illustrious Person, the Earl of <HI>Ossery,</HI> vouchsafed to Patronize; and although a Second Part, met with a Fate not common, to be esteem'd equal with the for∣mer.</P>
<P>Thus elevated by the Success of these my last heightned Essays, I thought it time to go on (having fitted Materials, both Historick and Poetick) with my long intended Edifice, my own great Fa∣brick, an <HI>Epick Poem,</HI> already divided into twelve Books, some al∣most finish'd, call'd <HI>CAROLIES,</HI> from our Miracle of <HI>Hero's, Charles</HI> the First, being the best Pattern of true Prudence, Valor, and Christian Piety; of whom, though too late, and too unworthy to be affix'd to his Herse, out of the abundance of my Zeal and Loy∣alty to so matchless a Worthy; I hope there may be indulgence for the placing these Lines, which may remain to Posterity, in the Portal of this Great Work.</P>
<Q><L>Mirror of Princes! <HI>Charles,</HI> the Royal Martyr,</L>
<L>Who for Religion, and His Subjects Charter,</L>
<L>Spent the best Blood Injustice Sword e're dy'd,</L>
<L>Since the rude Souldier Pierc'd our Saviours side;</L>
<L>Whose Sufferance, Patience, reach'd to such a height,</L>
<L>For Angels onely with Sun-beams to write:</L>
<L>No mortal Hand, less my unworthy Pen,</L>
<L>Fit to Display the best of Kings and Men.</L></Q>
<P>This Work thus settled, and so well resolv'd upon to be the Pride, Divertisement, Business, and sole Comfort of my Age, that day annually so fatal to the Royal Party, swallow'd in that devour∣ing Deluge of Fire, with most part of the City, that, and my whole Estate.</P>
<P>Thus fall'n into a low condition, groaning under a double bur∣then of Sickness and Poverty, and almost quite despairing, the Work that might have Boy'd me up once more, thus irrecoverably lost; and reminding, that many of my Friends, and Worthy Patrons were more favorable to my Endeavors, when under a Cloud, than after Shining in full Lustre; and that since his Majesties Restaura∣tion, the minds of those restor'd to former Fortunes, or rais'd to several Advancements, were more abroad, and not at leisure to
<PB REF="9"/>look on such private Divertisements at home; so that those later Volumns, which in course were Printed to perfect the former, re∣main'd a Drug, until the insatiate Flames, at once, and in one bad Market, clear'd me of my Store, and House also.</P>
<P>Besides grave <HI>Poesie,</HI> in which <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil's Heros</HI> spake Honor, and the greatness of their Souls; comprizing in few Lines, by Example, more Rules of good Life, than Phylosophers in many Volumns; loosing place and former Lustre, <HI>Rough Satyr, Rude Travestee,</HI> and <HI>Rhime Doggerel,</HI> gotten above, assisted with such, that confidently avouch, that we in this more Refin'd Age, speak better things <HI>ex tempore,</HI> than what hath been Recorded by the whole Rabble of Antiquity; looking down upon Moral Ver∣tues, as stale Saws, and stiff Formalities, onely fit for School-Boys <HI>Theams,</HI> and that our Brisker Youth, and more Sublime Wits, should be asham'd to peruse, much more to follow.</P>
<P>Thus a new <HI>Gaggle</HI> drowning the old Quire of <HI>Melodious Swans,</HI> I resolv'd to desist; and shutting up the Fountain of the <HI>Muses,</HI> left Clambering steep <HI>Pernassus,</HI> and fell into the beaten way, and more frequented Paths of <HI>Prose:</HI> My first undertaking be∣ing, <HI>An Embassy from New Batavia, to the Emperor of China,</HI> which Publish'd in my last Lottery, prov'd so acceptable, that I resolv'd to carry on in the same way hereafter, the whole Business of my Pen.</P>
<P>When, as in my former Acquisitions, I flew first at the highest and best <HI>Poetick Authors;</HI> so now as much ambitious, I pitch'd up∣on the like Accomplishment in <HI>Prose,</HI> and no less serves my turn, than the Reducement of the whole World, <HI>viz. A New and Accu∣rate Description of the Four Regions thereof,</HI> the first of which being <HI>AFRICA;</HI> wherein, having made some Progress, still Collecting more Materials towards the Compleating of so great a <HI>VVork,</HI> a Vo∣lumn lately Publish'd beyond Sea in <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> came to my hands, full of new Discoveries, being my chief and onely Business to en∣quire after, set forth by D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>O. Dapper,</HI> a Discreet and Painful <HI>Author,</HI> whose large Addition, added to my own Endeavors, hath much Accelerated the <HI>VVork;</HI> which thus being finish'd, adorn'd with more variety of Sculpture, Maps of Cities and Countreys, and a much larger Declaration than any yet extant, Presents it self to your favourable View and Acceptation; and will, I hope, (such is the Intrinsical Worth and Beauty thereof) invite a general Encou∣ragement from all parts, that I may more chearfully and speedily go on with the Remainder; which if the Effects follow, I doubt not, but a short time will produce the Happy Conclusion, by</P>

<P>NExt, in reference to those Coasts near the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> there hath been almost nothing said by former Writers, but onely what hath been Collected out of the several Journals of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in their Voyages to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> which are very large and Authentick.</P>
<P>THe Territories and Coasts of the <HI>Nether-Ethiopia</HI> are lately as well Sur∣vey'd and Delineated; first, by that Eminent Author <HI>Johan de Barros;</HI> next, <HI>Pigafet, Sanutus, Jarrick, Moquet, Od. Barbosa, Urreta, Maffeus, Peter Davty,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>FOr the Description of the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> or <HI>Upper-Ethiopia,</HI> of which we were till of late in a manner altogether ignorant, let us thank <HI>Nicholas Godig∣nus, Francois Alvarez, Jarrick, Dam. Goez,</HI> and especially Father <HI>Balthazar Tellez,</HI> who hath far exceeded all the former, having in an excellent Composure, in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Language, given us a large and accurate Description thereof.</P>
<P>ANd as concerning the Islands belonging to <HI>Africa,</HI> most of the fore-men∣tion'd Authors, with some few others, have set their Hands to; except the <HI>Salt-Isles,</HI> or those of <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and that of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which boast their Description chiefly from <HI>Blomert.</HI></P>
<P>ALso <HI>Madagascar,</HI> or <HI>St. Laureuce, Stephen de Flaccourt</HI> hath for the most part ingrossed and appropriated to himself; he being long resident there, im∣ploy'd by the <HI>French East-India</HI> Company: Besides, a <HI>Frenchman</HI> that suffer'd Ship∣wrack on that Coast, hath done well; but not so hit the Truth as the for∣mer.</P>
<P>FOr the Island of <HI>Malta</HI> we are beholden to <HI>Bosio, Megisaer, Hieronymo, Alex∣andrinus de Naberat,</HI> besides one, a great Observer, that long Inhabited there.</P>

<P>The Earth is divided into three Parts, or rather Islands, remoted from each other by Circum-ambient Sea, though their Largeness nominates them Con∣tinents. The first contains <HI>Europe, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> the second <HI>America;</HI> and the third Isle, <HI>Magellanica.</HI></P>

<PB N="4" REF="14"/>heat, therefore they never thought of further Penetrations, but blockt them∣selves up with a possest prejudice, and their own ignorance: Yet for all this, some old Writers admit most parts to be habitable, but with such monstrous Nations, that they deserve not to be accounted Humane, as
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">From <HI>Pomp.

<P>All which later Voyages have made void,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Africa</HI> habitable, and why.</NOTE> manifesting the contrary; for the In-land Regions are found for the most part habitable, and the Suns heat by shorter days and coolness of an equal night, assisted with moistening Dews, and fresh Breezes, is much moderated; And though <HI>Africa</HI> hath many Desarts, yet the greatest part, especially under and on each side the Aequator, suppos'd to be most insupportable, abounds with Springs, Brooks, and Shade-casting Trees; Besides under the Equinox, the Seasons of the Year differ from other Climates, for our remoter Suns bring Cold and Wet; our nearer, Heat and Drowth; but there the contrary: which many admire, yet never dive into the Occult Cause, but straight flying to Providence, say, so it must be: other∣wise who could inhabit there? which though we should not altogether reject, yet God working by secondary means, we may, modestly enquire by what? which may probably be thus.</P>
<P>¶ THe Sun darting fiery Beams daily perpendicular into the Sea, raiseth abundance of Vapour, which suddenly ascendeth the Airs colder Re∣gion, and there thinly crusting, becomes Snow, which sinking from thence dis∣solves into a misty Cloud, or Dewy Rain, then increasing its velocity ac∣cording to the Laws of descending Bodies, and also quitting that station, ga∣thers into bigger drops, which if in abundance, (as oft happens) falls with the greater violence, no more a Shower, but like Buckets-full, or Cataracts, whose irruption and sudden dis-embogue, agitating the <HI>medium,</HI> raiseth mighty and cooling Winds, which together supplies the parched Earth, and refrige∣rates the sultry Air.</P>
<P>¶ BUt yet this blessing extends not to the In-land Countreys, nor hath the <HI>Atlantick Ocean</HI> any such influence upon the Western Coasts, unless (which is very rare) the Winde comes from Sea, because the condensed Air, the far∣ther it penetrates, the more it rarifies, attenuated by the invading heat of the Soyl, that before it scarce contributes a Dew to stiffen the upper Sands, in a thin Cloud, re-ascending, vanisheth.</P>
<P>But yet the In-land and utmost Western Shores need not much complain, being for the most part Hilly, for there the Mountains are glutted with assi∣duous showres, for those huge congested Heaps, being the highest in the world, withstanding the Airs constant motion, still agitated from East to West, or ac∣cording to <HI>Copernicus,</HI> lagging from the Earths diurnal Course, which moves swiftest under the Equator, condenseth by Reverberation the subtiler Air into
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>its first Original, Water, which in the tumultuous commotions of eddying Windes, either finding, or forcing their passage, through unequal Glens and Declivings of the byass'd Mountains, they drive a constant trade, still brewing all sorts of stirring weather, as Winde, Rain, Hail, and Snow, which often covers their Skie-kissing Tops.</P>
<P>But these jarrings of the Elements there, produce happy effects below, vast Champaignes, which else would be all Desarts by natural Drowth, flourish in perpetual Green, fann'd always with cooling Gales, and kept moist with Mountain-floods, which converted into Springs, Brooks, and Rivulets, water in their <HI>Meandring</HI> Courses, barren Plains like a Garden; so that as in a Para∣dise you every where find shady and branching Trees, bearing allsorts of Fruit, like <HI>Alcinous</HI> Orchard, still blossoming, green, and ripe.

<P>Thus <HI>Africa,</HI> which else would be a miserable and unfrequented Desolation, is fruitful and populous, having alternately two Winters and Summers every year; Drowth making one, Moisture the other: but the tops and heads of these Mountains, according to their various Positions, differ from this general Rule, making some exceptions, setling their several Seasons otherwise; Of which I will instance some few.</P>
<P>¶ ON the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> Winter rules from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>September;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Air.</NOTE> Summer commenceth with the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> shutting up with the end of <HI>March:</HI> On the <HI>Coromandell</HI> Shores, just the contrary, yet both scituated alike under the Torrid Zone, in which Season happen great Floods, both from the Ocean, and sudden Falls from the Mount <HI>Gatis,</HI> not far distant. The like is found also at <HI>Cape Rosalgate,</HI> and <HI>Guardafuy,</HI> the utmost Eastern Point of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>¶ BUt to make a deeper and more exact Disquisition, is, that all <HI>Arabia</HI> towards the East of <HI>Africa,</HI> lies enclosed with Mountains, whose Rocky Battle∣ments appear above the Clouds, their swoln Ridges extending themselves in a long continued Wall, reach from the bottom of the <HI>Arabian Gulf,</HI> to the Islands of <HI>Curiamurie;</HI> these towery Hills of so prodigious height, not onely put to a stand all Windes and Rain, but turn them in their hurrying Eddyes, so dispersing every way, as well as in the two out-stretching Capes of <HI>Mo∣samde</HI> and <HI>Rosalgate,</HI> though they lye much lower than the rest of the Sea Coast: On these Rocky Ascents, appearing to Sea-ward rough and rugged, the poor Arabians, in a very sad condition make their residence.</P>
<P>These people have Winter with those of <HI>Coromandell;</HI> for their remoter Suns brings them Cold and Wet: but those who dwell on the other side of the
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>Mountains towards the Coast of <HI>Frankincense,</HI> have the same seasons with those of <HI>Malabar;</HI> so these Mountains work the like effect on the <HI>Arabians,</HI> as <HI>Gatis</HI> on the <HI>Indians,</HI> their Winter falling in <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> both in the Land of <HI>Frankincense, Arabia Felix,</HI> and the whole Coasts of the <HI>Curiamurian</HI> Isles, unto the Lake <HI>Babalmandab.</HI></P>
<P>Near the <HI>Arabian Gulf</HI> in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> you will meet there also the like altera∣tions, and the same seasons of the year as at <HI>Guardafuy,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Adell,</HI> and all along the <HI>Ethiopick</HI> Coasts, to the Mouth of <HI>Babalmandab,</HI> as we have, or those of <HI>Coromandell,</HI> finding in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> their hardest weather.</P>
<P>Then they which live betwixt twenty and thirty miles off the Coast, have their Colds more milde, and their Rains so temperate and harmless, they seem rather a comfort than a disturbance, Nature conferring on them such refresh∣ing Coolness: but if you venture farther up into the Countrey, then the <HI>Scene</HI> changing, you are tormented with excessive Heat, for at the same instant while Winter smiles on the Shore, it rages farther up, and their gentle Rains below so unequal to their deluging Showres above, that then there is no travelling any way, all Passages being obstructed with Floods, so sudden and violent, that many perish there with extream Cold, meerly from the raw De∣fluxes of chilling waters; such alterations the Mountain <HI>Dabyri Bizan</HI> causes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugees</HI> and <HI>Hollander</HI> have also discovered many more such places in <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> where their Winter and violent Rains commence in the <HI>Vernal Equinox,</HI> and continue <HI>March, April,</HI> and <HI>May;</HI> their milder showres in the Au∣tumnal, <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October;</HI> so that in some places they have two Seasons, their former and later Rain; for those steep Mountains (whence <HI>Zaire, Coansa, Bengo,</HI> and other great Rivers descend) obstruct the course of the Air, and the Land-windes, being hot and dry, but the South-west winde coming from Sea, brings Rain: hence it is manifest that <HI>Africa</HI> under the Torrid Zone, is for the most part Habitable.</P>

<P>Sataspes, Teaspes <HI>son, ravishing a Virgin, and Condemned to be Crucified, by the Media∣tion of his Mother,</HI> Darius <HI>Sister, was to suffer no more than to undertake a Voyage round</HI> Africa, <HI>which he but sleightly perform'd; for passing</HI> Gibraltar, <HI>he sayl'd to the utmost Point called</HI> Siloe

<P>¶ BUt what they knew not, and thought almost impossible to be known, is common; for the secrets of the Deep, and remotest Shores are now beaten and tracted with continual Voyages, as well known Roads are, since <HI>Vasques de Gamma</HI> a <HI>Portugees</HI> Anno 1497. first opened the Discovery, and finish'd, to the no small Honor of the Nation, his intended Design; for that People having got ground upon the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> widening the bredth of their commodious Sea-coasts, first fell on the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> taking several of their best Cities near the <HI>Atlantick; Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Viseo,</HI> yongest Son of <HI>Henry</HI> the I. encourag'd by this good Success, resolved to make this his Business, and sparing no Cost, invited from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> expert persons for his purpose, skilful in Navigation and Mathematical Sciences, by whose help and diligence in 1420. he found <HI>Madera,</HI> in 28. the Isle

<P>The next year after <HI>Alvares Capralde,</HI> with twelve Ships and fifteen hundred men, prosecuted the Design, but suffering Shipwrack on the Coast of <HI>Brazil,</HI> desisted; but the following year the former <HI>Vasques,</HI> and his brother <HI>Stephen,</HI> reassum'd the Undertaking with greater zeal and vigour: afterward by <HI>Fer∣dinand Almeida,</HI> and <HI>Alfonso de Albukerque,</HI> and so from time to time by several of that Nation, and last of all by the English and Hollanders. By this means the Moderns were exactly informed of the particulars of <HI>Africa,</HI> when the An∣cients knew no more than the Limits of the Roman Empire, and some parts belonging to <HI>Egypt,</HI> hearing strange Stories of Beasts and Monsters; whence arose this Adage:

<P><HI>Leo Africanus</HI> their most Eminent Author, and curious Searcher of his Native Countrey, in 1526. boasted that he had been through all, yet makes no more than four Provinces, as <HI>Barbarie, Numidia,</HI> or <HI>Biledulgerid, Lybia,</HI> and <HI>Negro-land,</HI> giving <HI>Nile</HI> for its bounds, not the <HI>Arabian Gulf,</HI> with the Streights of <HI>Sues,</HI> to the <HI>Mid-land</HI> Sea, so bestowing a great part of <HI>Egypt</HI> upon <HI>Asia</HI> Eastward; and as <HI>Marmol</HI> says, not once mentioning upper <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> or <HI>Abyssine,</HI> nor the nether, nor many other places discovered by the Portugues since; besides all that is now called <HI>New Africa,</HI> extending from the sixteenth degree of Northern Lati∣tude, to the <HI>Great Southern Cape,</HI> discovered by <HI>Vasques de Gamma.</HI></P>

<L><HI>Snow cloathes his Shoulders, his starch'd Beard is froze,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And from the old Mans Chin a River flows.</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
<P>All Writers affirm his wondrous height, that he seems to reach the sky: That side which views the Ocean to which he gave his Name, is rugged, bald, and dry; that towards the Land, seems hairy with Bushes, and shady with leavy
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>Trees, and watred with Springs, so being made fertile, in producing all sorts of Fruit: that by day his Inhabitants not see well, and that by night the Moun∣tain seems to shine and send forth flames, and (as some say) is full of Satyrs, and abounds with Echoes, resounding like Flutes, Trumpets, and Tabors.</P>
<P>The Lesser <HI>Atlas,</HI> call'd <HI>Lant,</HI> coasts with the <HI>Mid-land</HI> Sea, there known by the Name of <HI>Errif,</HI> extended from <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> unto <HI>Bona;</HI> the Spaniards call both <HI>Atlas'es, Montes Claros,</HI> or the <HI>Shining Mountains,</HI> because their eminency renders them perspicuous far off, or that their Spires shine above the Clouds; Thus <HI>Diego de Torres:</HI> But the <HI>Moors</HI> (saith <HI>Strabo</HI>) call them <HI>Dyris.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>Cape</HI> where the <HI>Atlantick</HI> shoots into the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, opposite to <HI>Europe,</HI> appears the Mountain <HI>Abyle,</HI> now by the Spaniard call'd <HI>Sierra Ximiera,</HI> or <HI>Sierra de las Monas,</HI> that is, <HI>Ape-hill;</HI> against this shews <HI>Calpe</HI> in <HI>Spain:</HI> these are the <HI>Herculean Pillars</HI> so much celebrated with a <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> by ancient Writers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chrystal Mountain,</HI> according to <HI>Pigafet</HI> in his <HI>Congo,</HI> shoots to the Sky his spiry and un-inhabitable Towers: on the Eastern skirts of that Province, there are found rich Mines of Chrystal.</P>
<P>Near which is the <HI>Mountain of the Sun,</HI> so call'd from its wondrous height, and being barren of all Vegetables.</P>
<P>On the same side Eastward, appears the <HI>Salt-petre Hill,</HI> so nam'd from the abundance fetcht from thence: This Mountain divides the River <HI>Sarbeles,</HI> whose sides are so watered by its parted Streams.</P>
<P><HI>Amara</HI> (that gives the vast Kingdom of <HI>Amara</HI> denomination) consists of most high and inaccessible Hills, which stand as Out-works to a strong Fort in the middle, where the Kings Sons have Education, kept with double Guards till their Fathers decease, then the next Heir taken from thence enjoys the Crown.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mountains of the Moon,</HI> which lye betwixt the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn</HI> and the <HI>Great Southern Cape,</HI> are the highest in <HI>Africa,</HI> or <HI>Europe,</HI> now call'd by the Inha∣bitants <HI>Betsh,</HI> they are Ledges of barren Rocks, always cloath'd with Snow and continued Ice, extending to the Coasts of <HI>Ceva</HI> in <HI>Goyame.</HI> Eminent Wri∣ters would prove (though false) that the Head of the <HI>Nile</HI> springs amongst these; And <HI>Ptolomy</HI> hath left on Record, that his Overflowings are fed with the disso∣lution of these Mountains Snow.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> appears the <HI>Table-Mount,</HI> so call'd from the flatness of its Crown, like a Diamond so squar'd, not far from the Shore on the South∣side of a pleasant River, from whence by a Cliff they scale the top, no way else any accession, being very steep and wondrous high, seen from the

<P>Westward from this is <HI>Mount Lyons,</HI> either supposed their Palace, (being a Re∣ceptacle of those Royal Beasts) or that the Hill resembles a Lyon couchant. Near <HI>Mount Table</HI> are those the Spaniards call <HI>Os Picos Fragosos,</HI> and the Italians <HI>Pici Fragosi,</HI> signifying <HI>sharp,</HI> or <HI>rough,</HI> such being their aspiring tops continually covered with Snow, all ranging in order one by another, at whose foot runs a great and swift River, which comes down from the Countrey. On the Border of <HI>Guinee</HI> appears another <HI>Mount Lyons, Sierra Leona</HI> in Spanish; in Portugues <HI>Sierra Lioa;</HI> there are several other Mountains in <HI>Africk</HI> of wonderful height and weal∣thy in Mynes: but we pass them over till we speak of them at large in their due place, and Descriptions of their several Countreys.</P>

<P>¶ THis Region abounds also with many great Lakes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lakes.</NOTE> the chiefest is that they call the <HI>Zaire,</HI> or <HI>Zembre,</HI> which <HI>Linschot</HI> takes to be the <HI>Old Triton,</HI> out of whose bosom issues two famous Rivers that water the Kingdom of <HI>Congo,</HI> the <HI>Coanze</HI> and <HI>Lalande:</HI> Some affirm that from the <HI>Nile, Zambere,</HI> or <HI>Couama</HI> have here their original; of which more at large hereafter.</P>

Such as are in common with us I shall not mention, but those Creatures most of them peculiar to that Countrey, but all strangers to <HI>Europe,</HI> will require an exact Inquisition, and here a room to be set forth in, because of their rarity.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>AFrica</HI> abounds with Camels, especially in the Wilderness of <HI>Lybia,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> Bile∣dulgerid,</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> they have them also in <HI>Asia;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camel.</NOTE> the Bactrians and Arabians use them for Burthens, nor travel they in <HI>Egypt</HI> without them: the Beast is cloven-footed, having a fleshy bunch on his back, onely peculiar to its Species, and another lesser bunch on the bending of his Knees, which seems Supporters to the whole Body; his Tayl is like an Asses, but has four knots like a Cows; his Pizzle which sticks out behind, is so sinewy, that they make of them the strongest Cross-bowe strings. Each Leg hath onely one Knee-joynt or bending, though they seem more, because of the trussness of his Hips, and short Buttocks; his Dung is like that of an Ox, his Gall lyes not separated as in other Beasts, but keeps in certain veins: Nature, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> write, hath bestowed on him two Maws, because he eats Thistles and Thorns, for the Uval of his Mouth, and the inward Skin of his Maw, are very rough.</P>
<P>Modern Writers, as <HI>Purchas, Peter de Avicen,</HI> and others,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three sort of Camels.</NOTE> say there are three sorts of Camels, the first (as <HI>Marmol</HI> tells us) the Arabians call <HI>Elhegen,</HI> which is so large and strong, that he will carry a thousand weight; the Africans geld them, so making them more hardy, ordering onely one Male to ten Females. The second sort call'd by the Arabians <HI>Bocheti,</HI> or <HI>Bechet,</HI> is lesser, and hath two bunches, each carrying Burthens, or a Man; these are onely in <HI>Asia.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Burthen.</NOTE> The third they call <HI>Raguahill,</HI> or <HI>Elmahari,</HI> are the Dromedaries, which are small,

<P>The <HI>Lybian</HI> or <HI>Mauritanian</HI> are lesser than the <HI>Indian,</HI> and (as <HI>Polybius</HI> writes) can not endure the Voice or Cry of the <HI>Indian Elephant;</HI> The <HI>Indian,</HI> though the lar∣gest of all, differ in size much amongst themselves; They shew'd one at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> that was eleven Foot betwixt his Eyes; and the utmost of his Trunk, from his Eye eight Foot in length: many are nine Foot high, some above eleven; <HI>Aloysius Camustus</HI> saw one whose flesh weighed more than five of our Stall-fed Oxen; They are all black, except the <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> yet the Relaters of the <HI>East-Indian</HI> Voyages say, that the King of <HI>Narsinga</HI> had a white Elephant.</P>
<P>Their Skin is rough and hard, but more on the back than the belly; they have four teeth that are Chawers, besides their Tusks which stick out of their Man∣dible, and are crooked, but the Females are streight; some of these Tusks are of an incredible bigness: <HI>Vertomanus</HI> saw two at the Isle of <HI>Sumatra</HI> that weigh'd three hundred thirty six pound. <HI>Polybius</HI> says, that in the borders of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> they are us'd for Jaums of Gates and Door-posts, and in Beasts-stalls for stakes.</P>
<P>For a Nose or a Snout, they have a long, small, hanging part, call'd a <HI>Trunk,</HI> reaching the ground and open, being sinewy and bending every way, it serves him for a Hand, with which he gathers both his Food and Potation, conveying so to his Mouth; through this he also breathes and smells: <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, they have Joynts in their hinder Feet below, but others write variously concerning the flexure of their Knees; some say they have Joynts in their Legs; others the contrary, and that if fallen they cannot rise: <HI>Plinie</HI> says (which experience al∣lows) that they have short Joynts in their hinder Legs, bending inwards like a Mans; their Feet are round like Horses Hooffs, but larger. <HI>Vertomanus</HI> com∣pares them to a round Table, their broad soal being eighteen inches over; their Toes (being five) look as if all one piece, being black and squadded, an unlick'd piece, so little cloven that they scarce make any separation. This creature hath two Teats, not on her Breasts but backwards, and more concealed; His Pizzle little, comparing his huge Bulk, and like a Stallions; his Stones appear not, but abscond about his Reins, which apts him more for Generation.</P>

<P>Their sustenance is Water-Herbs, browsing on Trees,

Elian</HI> tells us that they us'd to eat handsomly, and sit mannerly like men, not tearing or devouring their Victuals: when they drank, they took their Cup, delivering it to the next, draining the Goblet, moderately sprinkling the remainder as in a Joke upon the beholders; when they would pass any water that is scarce fordable, the tallest of them enters first, the rest passing by him, as it were a Bridge, to whom they cast Branches of Trees to help out at last.</P>
<P>Some affirm that they are Religious, adoring the most Eminent Lights, the Sun and Moon; and also hospitable, directing wandring Passengers when out of their way; observe Murtherers and other Criminals, and will detect such Guilty Offenders; how they will toss a Pike, and Fence one with another, playing out their several Weapons, and Dance after a Warlike manner. <HI>Auge∣rius Busbeek</HI> writes in his <HI>Turkish</HI> Letters, how he saw a young Elephant that Danc'd to a Song, and play'd at Stool-Ball, striking and retorting with his Trunk, as we with our hands; one at <HI>Rome</HI> would tye and untye hard knots by Moon-light, so cunningly complicated, that none else could unloose them, and patiently receive correction from his Master when he fail'd, and was out.</P>
<P>The female excels the Male in strength and hardiness; yet <HI>Aristotle</HI> makes the Female more timerous.</P>
<P><HI>Oppianus</HI> tells that they will beat down with their Teeth, Beech, Olive, and Palm-trees; and whole Houses, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> relates.</P>
<P><HI>Vertomannus</HI> Stories that an Elephant threw down a Tree, whose body four men could not Fathom, and that three Elephans drew a great Vessel on shore.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> saith they fight desperately, charging with their Teeth, and worsted, flye the menacing voyce of the Conquerour; an innate abhorring they have to Lyons, Serpents, Tygers, Rams, Swine and the Rhinoceros, and also to some Colours, and Fire.</P>
<P>Authors vary concerning their Copulation: <HI>Pliny</HI> will have the Male fit at Five years, the Female at Ten; but <HI>Aristotle</HI> allows Twenty years to both, of Twelve to the Female, if forwards; if slow, fifteen; they conjoyn usually in the water, which is easier for both, for the water supports the Male, and ligh∣tens so great a burthen, and fetches him after the Encounter more nimbly off; they deal in love-affairs very private, and but once in three years; choosing every Triennial a new Mistress, which work concluded they grow wild and almost stark mad, throwing down their Stalls and Stables; their time of pro∣duction is also uncertain, some say they go Eighteen Months, others Three
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>Years; a few stretch it to Ten, and these reduce it to Eight years; in Tra∣vel their pangs are great, squatting down on their hinder Legs, bringing but one at a birth, though others say, four; their young see and go as soon as born, Sucking with his Mouth, not his Trunk, Eight years.</P>
<P>They are taken several ways both in <HI>Africk</HI> and <HI>India:</HI> The <HI>Ethiopians</HI> knowing the Elephants Night-reposes, where he alwayes withdraws to sleep, catch him in a strong Palisado made of Timber, in a close Covert, a Trap-Door left open lying on the ground, which when the Elephant is in, they sculking in a Tree, draw up and shut with Ropes: when they have him sure in the Trap, they descend and shoot him to Death with Arrows; but if he chance to escape, rending their Gins, he spares none, killing all he meets.</P>
<P>Others Saw a great Tree half in sunder, making a pit on the side, then co∣vering it, which the Elephant suspecting nothing, being weary, retires to his old resting place, to which, he leaning, his weight oversets the half-cut Trunk, which failing, he falls into the covered Hole, and finds himself their Prisoner.</P>
<P>In <HI>Zenega</HI> near <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> the Inhabitants, sixty in a Company, draw forth, each Arm'd with six small, and one great Arrow, so finding his haunt, they stay till he resorts thither, which, by the loud rusling noise he makes, burst∣ing through opposing Branches, and overthrowing whole Trees, keeping his march, they know, then they follow him shooting continually, till their so many infixed Shafts, may bring him to his end, which the Blacks observe by the loss of Blood, and the stronger resistance of his confining Palisado against his feebler charge.</P>

<P>The Lyons forehead, (according to <HI>Aristotle</HI>) is of a middle size and four∣square; his Eyes not strutting out, nor yet hollow, his Nose rather thick than thin, his upper and under Jaws meet, yet open very wide when gaping, his Lips or closing of his Mouth thin, his Neck great and rough, moderately thick, his Breast strenuous, Belly slender, Legs strong and sinewy, Hair of a dark yellow, not falling in hard but looser curles, his Feet before have five claws, his hinder but four, the Majesty and Grandeur of his shaggy Mayn, differences him very much from the Lionnesse, who more signally may be known by the exuberances of her two Teats, according to the number of her young ones. <HI>Galen</HI> says, that the Lyons temples are very strong, that he may bite the harder, his Tongue rough, strangely red, as if fire, and speckled, hav∣ing but one bone in his Neck, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> holds: but <HI>Scaliger</HI> maintains, that it consists of many Joynts: his Complexion extremely hot and dry, caused by the sharp boyling of his heart. <HI>Gesner</HI> writes that his foreparts are hot, but his hinder cold and defective; he feeds sometimes on

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Horses.</NOTE> The Wild Horses amongst the more Savage <HI>Arabs,</HI> who live in the Desarts, are scarce, they eating them as delicate Venison, being wondrous sweet, when young: They catch them with Trammel'd Ropes lay'd under the Sand, Noosing their Feet; whatever means else is used for that purpose, proves vain, and frustrates the Hunters expectation.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rhinoceros.</NOTE> so call'd in <HI>Greek,</HI> that is <HI>Nosehorn,</HI> having one near the Tip of his Nose, hath a Skin speckled in tufts, with a mixture of Black and Grey, his Back looking as if saddled, his Sides and Ribs swell out Dosser∣wise, dented down to the Belly with folding panes; his Back is so hard, that a Partizan will scarce pierce it, nor hath it Scales (as with us reported) onely the deep furrows on his thick Hide resembling such: On the tip of his Nose, being like a Boars Snout, onely sharper at the end, there appears a Horn many times different in colour, being one while Black, another while of a lighter Colour: The bigness of this Beast varies, according to his Age: A midling <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> may compare with a midling Elephant, onely the short∣ness of his Legs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristotle.</NOTE> makes him much more despicable: In <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s time about 664. years before the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> neither the <HI>Greeks</HI> nor the <HI>Romans</HI> knew this Creature; Nor is it yet agreed upon by Writers who first shew'd it, though <HI>Dio</HI> sayes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dio. Pliny.</HI> Lib. 8. cap. 8. <HI>Solinus.</HI></NOTE> it first appeared in <HI>Augustus</HI> his Triumphs: for <HI>Pliny</HI> relates, that it was before shewn in <HI>Pompey</HI>'s Playes, which <HI>Solinus</HI> affirms, saying, the <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> was never seen before <HI>Pompey</HI>'s time: He feeds on bristly Leaves, and sharp Herbs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bontzius.</NOTE> having a very rough Tongue; insomuch, that <HI>Bontzius</HI> writes, that having cast down a Man and Horse to the ground, as if nothing, (which he never does, unless greatly provok'd) he kills him afterwards with licking, for the roughness of his Tongue, will immediately denude the Bones of their Fleshy coverings: He is at great enmity with the Elephant, against whom preparing to Fight, he whets his Horn upon a Stone, ayming to strike him in the Belly, his tendrest part, that so rending it open, he may bleed to Death; but if he miss that opportunity, the Elephant assuredly kills him with his Trunk and Teeth.</P>
<P>¶ THe Musk-Goat is not onely found in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musk-Goat.</NOTE> but as most Emi∣nent Writers affirm, in <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Egypt:</HI> There is difference among Au∣thors about its Description; yet all agree that it is a kind of Goat. We find in <HI>Martinus</HI> his <HI>Chinese Atlas,</HI> that in the Country of <HI>Xensi</HI> Musk grows in the Navel of a certain Beast not much unlike a Hart without Horns, whose Flesh the <HI>Chineses</HI> eat: When this Beast is high in lust, his Navil swells like a Tumor, or Bile full of Matter, and taken thence, resembles a thin hairy Purse stuffed with this costly Odour.</P>
<P>The Civet-Cat,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civet-Cat.</NOTE> called in Spanish <HI>Genetta,</HI> by the modern Greeks, <HI>Zapetia,</HI> and perhaps unknown to the Ancients, hath rough Hair, and is from the Head to the Tayl, a Cubit long, about the size of, and colour'd like a Wolf; near the Cods it hath a Purse, from whence they gather Civet: She eats eagerly raw Flesh and Mice, as also sweet things, Rice and Eggs. The Excrement (which flows out of the Purse-net near the Fundament, being full of small holes) hath at first a strong Scent, but put together and set in the Air, becomes most odoriferous; some suppose this to be the Sperm, which they take
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>daily out of the Purse with a Silver, Copper, or Horn Spoon, about the quan∣tity of one Dram: of which he will yield the more being anger'd or irri∣tated with a limber Twig or Wand, when you are to gather it.</P>
<P>The Leopard, hath a long Fore-head, round Ears,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leopard.</NOTE> very long and small Neck, little Ribs, a long Back, Thighs and Buttocks fleshy, and flat about the Belly and Hips, which are speckled, his whole Body wants shape and sym∣metry. On the Belly are four Teats; its Fore-feet have five, the hinder Feet four Clawes: his Eyes are more fiery than other Creatures in the dark, but dimmer in the open light; his Skin, according to <HI>Oppianus,</HI> is of a dark Yellow, dappled with Black upon White; 'Tis said he is marked in his Fore-head with a Half Moon, his Tongue is very Red, Teeth and Clawes sharp, and his Heart great, considering his bigness; he hath strong Legs, yet by reason of his great heat, is but lean: many of them are bred in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> in the Countrey of <HI>Comeri</HI> and <HI>Bengale.</HI></P>
<P>He Courts often the Lionnesse her self, sometimes driving a lower Trade with homely Bitches, and the She-Wolf. <HI>Isidore</HI> fabulously relates, that the young ones anticipate their Birth, tearing their Mothers Wombs: So much he hates man, that he assassinates his picture, though a meer Paper Sketch, yet flyes from a Dead Mans head; though some say, he fears onely a humane Visage, which <HI>Gesner</HI> confirms: He bears a great enmity to the Cock, Serpent, and Leeks. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that a Panther will not venture on any that is an∣nointed with Cocks-blood: and who wears a Panthers Skin need fear no Ser∣pents; such his Antipathy to the <HI>Hyena,</HI> that their Skins hang'd opposite, his will shed the hair, if you dare believe <HI>Pliny.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Camelopardelis,</HI> so call'd, as springing from the <HI>Camel</HI> and <HI>Pard,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camelopard.</NOTE> in size resembles the <HI>Camel;</HI> in his Marks or Spots, the <HI>Leopard,</HI> and is call'd <HI>Nabuna</HI> by the <HI>Moors,</HI> says <HI>Pliny,</HI> by the Moderns now <HI>Saffarat;</HI> the Greeks and Latines call it <HI>Gyraffa; Bellonius</HI> in his Observations describes this Beast very exactly, thus:
<Q>I saw a couple of them in <HI>Grand Cayro,</HI> each having two little horns in the Forehead about six inches long, between which appear'd a bunch like a third horn, about two inches high: from the Dock to the crown of the Head, was 18 foot; his Legs were much of a length before and behinde, but the upper Joynt or Shoulder-Bone, much longer than the Thigh: his Back slop'd like the ridge of a house, his whole Body is of a Deer-colour trick't up with many, great and square spots; Cloven-footed like an Ox, with his upper Lip over-hanging the under; his Tail little, thin, and tufted at the end; his Mane like a Horses, and seeming to limp in his going, first on the right, then on the left Leg: When he eats Grass, drinks Water, or takes other Food off from the earth, he stretches out his Fore-feet, otherwise he can take up no∣thing: his Tongue, as <HI>Josephat Barbarus</HI> writes, is two foot in length, of a sad Azure, long and round like an Eel, wherewith he gathers branches, leaves and herbs up into his mouth with an admirable celerity. <HI>Purchas</HI> adds, that a horse and man may pass under his Belly. <HI>Strabo</HI> says, he is found among the <HI>Troglodites,</HI> and <HI>Ethiopes. Caesar</HI> first shewed him at <HI>Rome,</HI> though 'tis probable they formerly abounded in <HI>Judea,</HI> being a food prohibited to the <HI>Jews.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here also are a kind of Wild Bulls, called by the Natives, <HI>Gualiox,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Bulls.</NOTE> but by the Spaniards <HI>Vacas bravas,</HI> that is, Mad, or Hectoring Bulls: They are swift as a Hart, but lesser than our Beeves, arm'd with horns black and sharp, but his Flesh is sweet, and his Hide fit for Tanning, making good Leather: In <HI>Barbary</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>they run together in herds, more than 100. sometimes 200. especially in the Countreys of <HI>Duquele</HI> and <HI>Tremisen,</HI> the Desarts of <HI>Numidia,</HI> and elsewhere.</P>
<P>¶ WIld Asses also are found in the Wildernesses of <HI>Numidia</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Asses.</NOTE> of a light grey, and for swiftness equalling the <HI>Barb.</HI></P>
<P>In the high Eastern part of <HI>Prester John</HI>'s Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goats.</NOTE> on the Banks of <HI>Nile,</HI> are Male-Goats as big as a wean'd Calf, their thick hair trailing on the ground: They have excellent Skins call'd <HI>Xarequies,</HI> which are drest, hair and all, with the Root of a Tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cows.</NOTE> stiled <HI>Alhanne:</HI> There also are great naked Cows, which the Egyptians call <HI>Demnie,</HI> with Tails trailing on the ground, and raising the dust like our Madams Gowns; and their Necks strip'd with divers colours.</P>
<P>In these parts are two sorts of Sheep,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheep.</NOTE> Woolly, and Hairy; The first differ from ours, only in their Horns and Tails, the last so round and thick, that the Sheep themselves are but subservient to their own Train, some there∣of weigh 15, others 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which happens chiefly in their fatting. <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> says,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their wondrous Tails.</NOTE> he saw one weighing 80 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Others report to have seen some of 150 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> weight: however, true it is, that the people are constrained to bind them upon little Carriages, that they may go with less impediment: All the fat that covers the Kidneys of other Sheep, is contributed upon their Tails; Store of them are found in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and of late in the East and West of <HI>Africa,</HI> and in the adjacent Islands.</P>
<P>The tame Cows in <HI>Africa</HI> are so small,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kine.</NOTE> that they seem to be but two year old Heifers, yet the Inhabitants of the Mountain <HI>Galate,</HI> as <HI>Leo</HI> writes, use them for Tillage, being very strong and laborious.</P>
<P><HI>Adimnaim</HI> is another tame Creature,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adimnaim.</NOTE> much like a Sheep, but great as a mid∣ling Ass, having long and pendulous Ears; the <HI>Lybians</HI> use them as Sheep, and their Milk (whereof they give much) serves both for Meat and Drink; their Wool is short, but good; the Males are without, but the Females have horns: they are mild and tractable, having strength enough to carry a Man a days Journey; they breed chiefly in the <HI>Lybian</HI> Desarts, and some few in <HI>Numidia.</HI></P>
<P>The Arabian <HI>Dabuch,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dabuch.</NOTE> which the Africans call <HI>Jesef,</HI> is of the bigness of a Woolf, and resembling him in all parts but his Legs and Feet, wherein he is like a man: He hurts no other Beasts, but devours the Dead, digging them out of the Graves, which is no strange thing, the <HI>Moors</HI> usually burying in the open fields; when the Hunters know his recess, they make their approaches Singing and Playing on Musical Instruments, ravish't with the pleasure there∣of, he is drawn forth to listen, where they in the mean while snare and kill him. <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> says, they are found in the Woods of <HI>Mauritania, Pegus, Congo, China,</HI> and divers other parts, especially in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where they breed very much.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dub</HI> being in the Wilds of <HI>Lybia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dub.</NOTE> of the length of a mans Arm, and the bredth of four fingers, hath a strange antipathy to Water, so that if any be put into its mouth, he immediately dyes: They lay Eggs like a Turtle, and are harmless; their Flesh roasted, tastes, as they say, like the hinder part of a Medow-Frog; he is very swift, and so strong, that if his head be in a hole, and his tail out, no strength can draw him thence, except you loosen his hold by widening the passage; it has a kind of trembling Convulsive motion three days after it is slain, if but exposed to the Fire.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
<P>The <HI>Guarall</HI> is like the <HI>Dub,</HI> but bigger,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guarall.</NOTE> having poison both in his Head and Tail, which is the cause that the <HI>Arabians</HI> throw them away when they Cook the rest.</P>
<P>In <HI>Africa,</HI> especially in <HI>Biledulgerid</HI> and <HI>Lybia</HI> is a Beast, like a little Bull,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lant.</NOTE> or small Cow, called the <HI>Lant;</HI> It seems to be that <HI>Bubalus</HI> of old, which <HI>Aristotle</HI> says, is a timerous Creature, having neither Hair or Wooll: which <HI>Leo</HI> thus de∣scribes; <HI>The</HI> Lant, <HI>or</HI> Dant, <HI>resembles an Ox, but smaller Legg'd, and his Horns less, with white Hair and black Hooves, and so swift, that no Beast unless the</HI> Barb, <HI>can once overtake; yet easier to be catch'd in Summer than in Winter, because the Parching heat of the Sand softens and loosens his Hooves.</HI> But <HI>Scaliger</HI> sayes: <HI>The</HI> Dant, Lant, <HI>and</HI> Elant, (which is all one and the same, though different in name) <HI>is white hair'd, fac'd like a Cow, but less in body, yet much swifter and nimbler; so that they excell all Wild Beasts both in agility and speed: Their Skin so strong and tough, that Steel will not pene∣trate: the best time to catch them is the Summer, for then their Hooves become loose and tender by the heat of the Sand: Bellonius</HI> makes another sort, being (saith he) <HI>a full grown Beast, smaller than a Deer, but bigger than a wild Goat, and so well propor∣tioned in shape, that it is pleasure to behold; his yellow hair so sleek and shining, as if Curried and Dress'd; his Belly strip'd or dappled with more brisk and various Colours than his Back, which is dusky; Cloven-footed, with strong stubbed Legs, a thick short Neck, black and very crooked Horns, Ears like a Cow, Thighs full and plump, his Tail as a Camelopard, hanging down to his heels, full of bristly and rough hair, Lowing very like, but not so loud as an Ox.</HI> This they find in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Desarts, and between the Mountains of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Catay,</HI> and divers parts of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>¶ SOme Writers say, that in <HI>Africa,</HI> in the Mountains of <HI>Beth,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unicorn.</NOTE> in <HI>Upper-Ethiopia,</HI> breeds the Unicorn: <HI>Garcias ab horto</HI> tells, that he saw one be∣tween the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and <HI>Cape de Currentes,</HI> though Modern Authors do not without cause deny, and hold it a Fiction, and that there can be no such Creature as the Antients describe. <HI>Strabo</HI> out of <HI>Onesicritus</HI> saith, it is like a Horse; but <HI>Philes,</HI> that his Tail being ringl'd, resembles a Wild Boar, and that he opens his Mouth like a Lyon: According to <HI>Pliny,</HI> he hath a Harts head, Feet like an Elephant, Tail of a Boar, and the rest representing a Horse, with a Horn in his Forehead two Cubits long: <HI>Isidorus</HI> makes him the same with the <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI> affirming his Horn so strong and mighty, that he either breaks or penetrates quite through what e're he strikes: <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> tells us, that the Great <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary</HI> uses them, and that in the Region of <HI>Lambri,</HI> they are smaller than an Elephant, having a flat head like a wild Swine, an angular Tongue, wherewith they take in what food they can get, and the rest of their Shape agrees with the <HI>Rhinoceros.</HI> One <HI>Lewis de Barthema</HI> of <HI>Bononia</HI> writes thus of it: <HI>Near the Temple at</HI> Mecha, <HI>are Stables wherein they keep two living Unicorns; the one having a Horn near four handfuls in length. But the other being of the growth of a Colt of two years and a half old, had a Horn on his Forehead near seven foot long, the Body being of a sad Colour, with a Head like a Hart, short Neck, little Hair, and thinly Main'd, spindle shanks like a Deer, Feet with Hooves a little cloven; be∣ing by nature Wild, and loving solitude:</HI> That which we call in <HI>Europe</HI> the Unicorns Horn, and preserve as a costly and rare Cordial, belongs to a Monster or Sea-fish taken in the North-Seas, upon the Coasts of <HI>Island, Greenland,</HI> and other adjacent Isles: which we thus describe.</P>
<P>It is a full and well-grown Fish, near eighteen foot long, and twelve broad;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea-Unicorn.</NOTE> headed like a Perch or Carp; the Horn shoots out of the upper Jaw above
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>his Mouth, opens very wide, not right in the middle, but a little more towards the left side; its Skin is russet, under which lyes very much fat, whereof are made great quantities of a nauseous and ill scented Oyl, which for that cause hath little esteem. The Back-bone consists of many strong Joynts, ending in a forked tail, armed on both sides with strong prickles: The Horn is streight, hard, white, and so neatly adorned with deep wreathings, as if it were smoothly polish'd, and Artificially turn'd Ivory; in length sometimes nine, ten, twelve foot, or more; whose vertues are not inferior to those ascribed to the Land-Unicorn, as well in driving out the Measles and Small Pox, as in asswaging Malignant Feavers, and tough Distempers of Agues.</P>
<P>In <HI>Nubia</HI> and the Kingdom of the <HI>Abyssines,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zorafes,</HI> or <HI>Giraffes.</HI></NOTE> is a Beast called <HI>Zorafes,</HI> or <HI>Gi∣raffes,</HI> as big as a two-years old Heifer, having a Neck like the Glave of a Javelin, or Half-Pike, and a head resembling a <HI>Gazell,</HI> with Legs short behind and long before, hair'd and brindled like an Ox, the Ears like a Hart, and Breast smooth and shining; which the <HI>Africans</HI> say is generated of two Spe∣cies; he wanders solitarily through the Woods, flying from men, and not to be taken, but young.</P>
<P>¶ HAving treated thus far of Beasts; We shall now briefly present you with some Plants and Vegetables, referring their full discourse to the places where naturally produced.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Africa</HI> be in some places very fertile, yet a great part of the Country lyes waste and unmanured, full of Barren Sands, or abounding with Serpents, in such manner, that the Peasant dare not Till the ground, unless Booted; but the manured parts afford a rich crop to the industrious Husband∣man, yeilding oftentimes an hundred fold encrease.</P>
<P>The chief Grain of <HI>Africa,</HI> is Wheat, Rye, Barley, Rice and Maiz, and besides the Trees growing there, that are in common with <HI>Europe,</HI> are divers others not found amongst us, such are the <HI>Cassia,</HI> Egyptian Fig-tree (the Inhabitants term it <HI>Guimeiz</HI>) the Date, Cotton, Coco, and Balsam-tree, Sugar-Canes, and the like Productions, with which they drive a great Trade with us in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Among others in the Wildernesses of <HI>Lybia,

<P>Of the Tree <HI>Argan</HI> or <HI>Erguen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argan.</NOTE> an Oyl is made by the Inhabitants; whereof more at large in the Description of <HI>Hea</HI> a Province of <HI>Marocco.</HI></P>

Another Root yeilding a very sweet and pleasing scent, is found on the Western parts on the Sea-shore, which the Merchants of

<P>All the Salt in the most part of <HI>Africa,</HI> as <HI>Leo</HI> saith, is dig'd out of Salt-pits,

<P>¶ HItherto we have lightly touch't several things; as first, that <HI>Africa</HI> is for the most part habitable, from the mildness of the weather and the sea∣sons conducing thereunto; next the greatness of the Mountains, richness of their Mines, enumerated their Provinces and Kingdoms, the variety of Creatures, Plants, Grain, and Herbage: now we will say something of the people them∣selves, their Statures, Complexions, Manners and Religions.</P>
<P>Some divide the <HI>Africans</HI> into Black and White, but a curious eye may easily observe a great difference in the colours of those people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Complexions of the People.</NOTE> as not being under the same climate:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blacks and White.</NOTE> Such as in habit in and about <HI>Guinee,</HI> and the <HI>Negroes</HI> Land, be∣tween the Equinoctial and Tropick, are Black; who live in <HI>Prester John</HI>'s Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brown and Olivaster.</NOTE> are Brown and Olivaster, but the Natives of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> (which of all <HI>Africa,</HI> is the most Southward) are the Blackest. Experience therefore clears the vanity of that conceit, that according as people live nearer or farther from the <HI>Aequator,</HI> so they are Blacker or Whiter; whence it would follow, those who have the Sun directly over them, must needs be the Blackest; and the farthest therefrom, the whitest: whereas Nature in this case hath frustrated the fancy of the Learned, by a visible contrary, giving diversity of colours to the Inhabitants of the same degree: for the <HI>Patagons</HI> a great people near the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> are totally white, whereas at the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Good Hope</HI> under the same Latitude, they are very Black; of the causes whereof are
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Brown</HI>'s Vulgar Er∣rors. l. 6. cap. 10, 11, 12. of the Blackness of <HI>Negroes.</HI></NOTE> various opinions, but which carries the greatest probability of truth, we will not here discuss.</P>
<P>Nor is there a greater distinction of Complexions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stature.</NOTE> than difference in the bulk of their Bodies;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gygantick.</NOTE> the Natives of the Kingdom of <HI>Neguz,</HI> being Giant-like; those of <HI>Mosambique,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dwarf-like, and Middle.</NOTE> Dwarfish; and those of <HI>Barbary,</HI> of a middle Stature. As to their several characters and dispositions, we shall touch them in the Descrip∣tion of each particular Country.</P>
<P>For Valour and Courage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Un-warlike.</NOTE> they are much inferior to the <HI>Europeans;</HI> neither understanding to handle Arms, nor willing or forward to learn: A great number of them not long since, by their effeminacy were conquer'd by a few <HI>Portugues:</HI> One strong Fort, with a small Garrison, keeps a whole Countrey in awe, and a

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Prester John</NOTE> he never durst attempt to recover. 'Tis true, in some places, the people are very wilde, savage, and dangerous to deal with, but their ignorance and unskilfulness in Arms, makes their fierceness little avail for defence of so great a Countrey. Among all these Provinces,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barbary</HI> Warlike.</NOTE> <HI>Barbary</HI> is the most Warlike; having a long time by the Christians
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>been exercised in Martial affairs, making manful resistance against all inva∣ding attempters, with the assistance of her home-born <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabs:</HI> yet they are kept in awe by the Christian Forts on the Sea-coast, receiving from them no small damage, without hopes ever to recover what they knew not how to keep.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Africa</HI> divers sorts of people, generally divided into <HI>Arabians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several people.</NOTE> and <HI>Aborigenes,</HI> sub-divided again into Whites and Blacks; of which two kinds so dispers'd over <HI>Africa,</HI> it will be worth our pains to set down their places of abode, manners, and strengths.</P>
<P>The White <HI>Africans</HI> are by <HI>Johannes Leo,</HI> divided into five Tribes, <HI>viz.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">White <HI>Africans,</HI> their di∣vision.</NOTE> Zanha∣gians, Musmudans, Zenetans, Haoranians</HI> and <HI>Gumeranians;</HI> which are again sub∣divided into six hundred Families, as their Historian <HI>Ibnu Rachu,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marmol.</NOTE> by <HI>Marmol</HI> named <HI>Ibni Alraquiq,</HI> hath Registred: The same <HI>Marmol,</HI> calls the first two <HI>Zinhagians</HI> and <HI>Mukamudans,</HI> in the other three agreeing with <HI>Leo,</HI> who says, That the <HI>Musmudans</HI> dwell East and by South from Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> inhabiting all the Plains, and commanding the four Provinces of <HI>Hea, Sus, Guzule,</HI> and <HI>Marocco.</HI> The <HI>Gumeranians</HI> possess the Mountains of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> towards the Mid-land Sea, and the Strands of <HI>Errif,</HI> beginning from the Streights of <HI>Gibral∣tar,</HI> and extending East-wards to the borders of the Kingdom of <HI>Tremisen:</HI> These two people live apart, whereas the other three live mix'd one among another, but may as easily be distinguish'd by the <HI>Air</HI> of their faces, and <HI>Mien</HI> of their bodies, as the Natives from Strangers, being at continual hostility among themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zenetans</HI> and <HI>Haoranians</HI> inhabit the fields of <HI>Temesne,</HI> but the <HI>Zinhagians</HI> in the <HI>Lybian</HI> Wildernesses, (whereby it appears that in former times they all had their dwellings in the Plains) each favouring his own party, and imploy∣ing themselves in works necessary for humane subsistance. The Gover∣nours are Pastors, or Keepers of Cattel; but the Citizens apply themselves to Trading, the Mechanicks also follow Husbandry. Some Writers imagine that the Kings of <HI>Tombuto, Melli,</HI> and <HI>Agadez,</HI> are sprung from these <HI>Zin∣hagians.</HI></P>
<P>The first Planters of the Eastern Desarts of <HI>Africa,</HI> are now term'd <HI>African Bereberes,</HI> descended from the <HI>Sabeans</HI> of <HI>Arabia Faelix,</HI> who came thither with their King <HI>Melek Ifiriqui,</HI> mentioned before: But those of <HI>Tingitana, Numi∣dia</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> are call'd <HI>Bereberes Xilohes:</HI> when these people fell at variance, the Conqueror remaining Master of the Field and Cattel, forc'd the Van∣quished to secure themselves in the Mountains, or more populous Cities, who intermixing with the other <HI>Africans,</HI> came at last, as they, to dwell in Houses, and to be equally subject with them: Therefore those which live in
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Abraham</HI> journeyed with his Family and Cattel, as these, &amp; lived in Tents. <HI>Gen.</HI></NOTE> Tents, as the <HI>Arabians,</HI> are counted more noble, because more mighty, and richer in Cattel; yet both preserve their Pedigree and Descent, having their habitation in the strongest places of <HI>Barbary, Numidia</HI> and <HI>Lybia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mukamudens</HI> hold four Provinces of <HI>Marocco</HI> in common with the <HI>Zene∣tans,</HI> with them residing in the Fields of <HI>Temesne,</HI> the utmost westerly part thereof. These are now a mean people, called <HI>Xavies:</HI> But others of them inhabiting part of the Great <HI>Atlas,</HI> bordering on this Kingdom, and <HI>Tremisen,</HI> are very valiant, maintaining continual Wars with the Turk: Another sort of them dwell in the Countreys of <HI>Constantine</HI> and <HI>Tunis;</HI> some in the Fields, like the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and a few dispersed in Houses and Towns.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
<P>The <HI>Haoranians</HI> are mixt with the <HI>Zenetans:</HI> The <HI>Zinhagians</HI> reside behind the Mountains of <HI>Barka</HI> unto <HI>Nefuca,</HI> and <HI>Gueneris:</HI> The <HI>Gumeranians</HI> possess the Lesser <HI>Atlas,</HI> where it extends towards the Midland-Sea, and along the bounds of <HI>Ceute,</HI> to the utmost part of <HI>Mauritania Tingitana,</HI> bordering on the Imperial <HI>Mauritania.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THere are another people scattered over <HI>Barbary</HI> and <HI>Numidia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Effeminate people scat∣ter'd in <HI>Barbary.</HI></NOTE> for the most part Herdsmen: some so effeminate that they Spin and Weave, yet live very poorly in Mountainous Holes and Caves, Tributary to the <HI>Arabians.</HI> Others are War-like, and laborious, enjoying liberty, and not acknowledg∣ing any Superior. They claim as their chief Seat, the Provinces of <HI>Temesne</HI> and <HI>Fez:</HI> But those who inhabit that part of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis</HI> adjacent to the Date-Countrey, are the most mighty and stout, having dared to engage in a War with the King of <HI>Tunis, Anno</HI> 1509. and gave Battel unto <HI>Mules Nacer</HI> Son of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> King thereof, endeavoring to subject them; who at this day bear Rule over the Kingdoms of <HI>Cauco</HI> and <HI>Labez.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Zenegans,</HI> or <HI>Zanagans,</HI> the <HI>Guanesers, Tergers, Lempters,</HI> and <HI>Berdoans,</HI> all very poor and despicable, living without Order or Laws in Tents, and rove about with their Horses, like the <HI>Arabs</HI> through the <HI>Lybian</HI> Wildernesses.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Arabians</HI> in <HI>Africa</HI> are more Savage, wandring over the Moun∣tains, and through the Woods. Others dwell in Cities, and are called <HI>Hadares,</HI> that is, Courtiers; being indeed Merchants for the most part; the rest apply themselves to Study, or follow Princes Courts, and are counted less noble, because they mix their blood with others. Those which inhabit <HI>Fez,</HI> are intituled <HI>Garbes,</HI> that is, West-countrey-men; such as dwell Eastward, <HI>Xarquies,</HI> that is,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diego de Torres.</NOTE> Easterlings; which made <HI>Diego de Torres</HI> divide the Countrey into <HI>Xar∣quia</HI> and <HI>Garbia:</HI> The <HI>Lybian Arabs</HI> are Savages, but stout and war-like, Tra∣ding with Merchandize upon Camels to the <HI>Negroes</HI> Countrey, and keeping many <HI>Barbary</HI> Horses, oft-times recreating themselves with hunting of Wilde Asses, Ostriches, and other Beasts: The <HI>Numidians</HI> are great friends of the Muses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Numidians</HI> are Poets.</NOTE> and highly pleas'd with Poetry, Poets naturally, being much addicted thereunto, having so rich fancy, that on all occasions they set forth their Passions and Love-fits in a smooth and elegant stile: They are also jealous, especially in bestowing their favours, lest they discover their wealth and abilities: The Men go apparelled as the <HI>Numidians,</HI> but the Women differ.</P>
<P>Those between Mount <HI>Atlas</HI> and the <HI>Mid-land Sea,</HI> are much wealthier than these of <HI>Numidia,</HI> both in sumptuousness of Apparel, richness of Tents, and abundance of Horse, which are handsomer, and more full and brawny than the former, but want much of their speed. Tillage and Cattel are their chief livelyhood, the later of which are so numerous, that they are often compell'd to remove and seek new Pastures: They are Savage like those of the Wilder∣ness; some living as Subjects to the King of <HI>Fez,</HI> but others in <HI>Marocco</HI> and <HI>Du∣cale,</HI> formerly free from Tolls and Taxes, till the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> began to conquer <HI>Asafi, Aza</HI> and <HI>Azamor,</HI> when after a civil War, and the miseries of its common Attendant, Famine; they freely submitted to the <HI>Portugueses.</HI></P>
<P>They of the Wilderness about <HI>Telesin</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> are rich and stately; their Rulers drawing great Sums of Money yearly from the Neighbour Kings, which is equally distributed among the people, who pride themselves in comely habits, being ingenious in making Tents, and Breaking or Riding Horses:
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>In Summer they come to the very borders of <HI>Tunis,</HI> to gather Contributions; and in Harvest furnish themselves from other mens labours, with all Necessa∣ries, as Victuals, Clothing, and Arms, wherewith fully supplyed, they return to their old Winter Quarters; but the Spring they spend in Hunting: Their Tents abound with greater plenty of Cloth, Copper, Iron, and other Mettals, than the richest Ware-houses of some Cities; and no mar∣vel, for under the pretext of courtesie and civility,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Poets rewardes</NOTE> they steal all they can lay hold on: They are also ingenious Poets, and the best of them, get not only praise, but according to their excellency, have rich rewards, and high honours from their Governours.</P>
<P>The Women, according to the custom of the Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women.</NOTE> wear black Gowns with wide Sleeves, cover'd somtimes with a mantle of the same colour, or blew, fastned about their Necks with Silver Clasps: their Ears, Fingers, Legs and Ancles, are adorn'd with Silver Rings: If any man, except their Kindred and intimate Acquaintance, meet them abroad, they cover their Faces with Vi∣zard Masks, and pass by in silence: In all their Journeyings (which are fre∣quent) the Women ride on Tin Saddles fastned to the Camels backs, big enough only for one; yea, and going to war, their Wives accompany them, the more to encourage them to fight for them and their Children.</P>
<P>The Maids Paint their Faces, Breasts, Arms and Hands; but the more noble Women content themselves with their own natural Colours and Com∣plexions; only somtimes out of Hens Dung and Saffron, they mix a Colour, wherewith they make a little round Beauty-spot in the Center of their Cheeks, a Triangle between their Brows, and an Olive-leaf, or long Oval, upon their knees: Their Poets and Amours so highly commend the painting of the Eye∣brows, that it is not used above two or three dayes together; in which time none but her Husband and Children may see her, because they account this painting a great incitation to <HI>Venus,</HI> as thereby supposing themselves much more beautiful and handsom.</P>

<P>The Men wear about their heads a kinde of Shash,

<P>¶ AS <HI>Africa</HI> is thus blest with the extraordinary production of Cattel and Corn,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mines of Gold and Silver.</NOTE> so the infertility of the Desarts is in many places recompenc'd by rich Mines of Gold and Silver. <HI>Guinee, Sofale, Gago, Nubia,</HI> and divers other contain such Mines of Gold; as, <HI>Angola, Monomotapa,</HI> and other King∣doms produce excellent Silver, not without some Gold; the Kingdom of <HI>Neguz</HI> is rich in many sorts of Merchandise; the Coasts of <HI>Barbary</HI> inhabited by the Turks, yields Corral, which they dive for, growing upon Rocks under water; and <HI>Tombuto</HI> affords the finest Gold, and other precious Rarities; so that <HI>Africa</HI> is not to be esteemed the least or meanest part of the World.</P>

<P>Those that inhabit Westward, near <HI>Tremesen,</HI> and the Wildernesses of <HI>Barka,</HI> carry sharp, long-pointed iron Javelins, which they cast here and there, forwards, backwards, and on every side at their Enemies, that like the antient <HI>Parthians,</HI> they do greater execution in flight, than charging in Battel; yea, some of them are so hardy, that one of them so mounted will engage their single person some∣times against a dozen of their opposers: They use no Shields, nor other de∣fensive Arms; some few have Bowes; fewer Gunnes, which they onely carry to terrifie the Wilde <HI>Arabs,</HI> who fly from the report, as Wilde-fowl, not onely fearing, but abominating so base and treacherous an Engine that surprizes at such distance, and kills before warning, the sound not being heard till execution.</P>
<P>All their Wars hitherto have been managed on Horse-back, yet lately those of <HI>Tremesen</HI> have some Musketiers, but they use neither Ranks nor Files, but fall on in disordered Plumps, so many crowded together, and throng'd up in a narrow circle: And if assaulted, dissipate immediately, endeavoring to break through the Ranks, or else making huge gaps, force their passage to escape by flight, or in so doing break through the imbodied Enemy.</P>

<P>What <HI>Mahomet</HI> contrived designing his Foundation for this (as they call it) his Law, appears in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> wherein speaking of Christ, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the Gospel, and himself, he says; That <HI>God, Jesus,</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> wrought Miracles before men. And in another place; <HI>The Word of God, Christ Jesus, the Son of</HI> Mary, <HI>was sent by the Creator of the World, to be the face of all people in this, and the Ages to come.</HI> Elsewhere he confesses, <HI>That Christ is the power of God, the Word, Wisdom, Soul, Breath, and Heart of God, born by a Divine inspiration of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>that he raised the Dead to life, made the Blind to see, the Lame to go, and wrought many other miracles. That he was more excellent than all the Prophets, and that the Jews had no more Prophets after him.</HI> He prefers <HI>Jesus</HI> before all men and Prophets, and <HI>Mary</HI> above all Women; but averreth withall, that the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Heresie of the <HI>Anthropomorphites.</HI></NOTE> Traitor <HI>Judas</HI> was Crucified in stead of Christ, being changed into his likeness, and apprehended in his likeness in the Garden. Speaking of himself in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> he useth these words, <HI>That he did no miracle, nor should; that he was ignorant of most things; that he was a meer man, though sent and inspired by God, and could not forgive sins.</HI> He forbad people to worship him; confessing that the truth of some things ex∣tant in his Books may be doubted. He acknowledges the power of the Gospel, in that he calls in a <HI>Light,</HI> a <HI>Guide,</HI> and <HI>Perfection;</HI> And much diminished the Authority of his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> in saying, <HI>Every one that worshippeth the true God, and liveth honestly and uprightly, be he</HI> Jew, Christian, <HI>or</HI> Saracen, <HI>shall obtain mercy and salvation.</HI> His Disciples believe the Creation of the World, that <HI>Adam</HI> was made of earth, all the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Histories, and Christs Doctrine in part; They acknowledge a Resurrection of the Dead, the last Judgment, Rewards, and eternal Punishment in Hell; and that Christ shall sit next to God in judgment, which are points so seemingly consonant to the truth, that weak Christians mistaking those general notions, think it no great error to submit to it; but all those fair shews and formal species are quickly overthrown and dash't to pieces by <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s assuming too much to himself, where he saith that Christ had profit by him in these words; <HI>I declare unto you from the Messenger of God who shall come after me, whose name is</HI> Mahomet, <HI>that is written from eternity, in the sight of Gods Throne, on his right hand:</HI> 'Tis true, he commends <HI>Moses</HI> highly, and owns <HI>Christ</HI> greater than <HI>Moses,</HI> but himself the greatest of all. He further adds, that the Christians have corrupted the Gospel, and the Jews the Law of <HI>Moses;</HI> But yet both together makes up the same, and as much truth as is in his <HI>Alcoran.</HI> That he was sent and directed by God, to settle his Law by force of Arms, but Christ in the power of Miracles.</P>

<P>These amorous encounters being the top of his Paradise, <HI>Mahomet</HI> by the help of <HI>Sergius</HI> an Apostate Monk, imping the Poets fancies, introduced as the greatest of all allurements, setting forth Beauties most admir'd by the <HI>Asiaticks</HI> with full and black Eyes, who shall alone regard their particular Lovers, not such as have lived in this world, but created of purpose, which daily shall have their lost Virginities restored, ever young and Feasting with all variety of Delicacies.</P>
<P>They have three sorts of <HI>Marabouts</HI> or Saints; The first affirming; that a man by good works and fasting, and abstinence from Meat, may attain the nature of an Angel; the heart by these Duties, say they, being so cleansed from all infection of evil, that although it would, it can sin no more, and that to attain happiness, they must ascend by the steps of fifty Sciences. They live very strictly at first, and torment themselves with fasting, keeping a long
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>Lent; after which the Scene changing, their abstinence and mourning turns to all Feast and Merriment, and their whole life is a continual
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Parallel to those <HI>Bac∣chanalian</HI> Revels mention∣ed by <HI>Virgil.</HI></NOTE> Carneval, which they spend in <HI>Maskings,</HI> and <HI>Serenaids,</HI> and all manner of dissolute and intoxicated pleasures; whereof four Books are written by <HI>Eseb-ravardi Schra∣varden Sein,</HI> a Learned man born in the City of <HI>Corasan. Ibnul Farid,</HI> another Author, hath described their whole Religion in a Poetick stile; upon which one <HI>Elfargari</HI> made an Exposition, collecting the Rules of the Sect, and disco∣vering the steps to attain happiness. These Verses are made in so sweet and elegant a stile, that they will sing no other at their publick Feasts and Merry∣meetings; Some of their Tenets are as follow, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Heavens, Planets, and fixt Stars, are holy; that no Law or Religion is erroneous, every one being at liberty, to pray to what his mind is most enclined to; That all knowledge of God was infused into the first man, whom they name <HI>Elchot;</HI> and that man elected by God, is made like him in knowledge. After this <HI>Elchot</HI>'s death, forty men called <HI>Elanted,</HI> that is, the Heads or Chief, choose another out of their own number, and when any of these forty happen'd to dye, then they choose another out of the number of seven hundred sixty five. These Vagabond Sectaries are by certain rules of their order to go alwayes unknown, in poor and despicable rayment, so that whoever sees them, would judge them to be Mad-men, and void of all honesty and humanity, rather than <HI>Marabouts</HI> or <HI>Saints;</HI> for they run naked and wilde all over <HI>Africa,</HI> and force Women pub∣lickly (as beasts) without modesty or shame. <HI>Leo</HI> saith, that many of them are in <HI>Tunis,</HI> but more in <HI>Egypt</HI> at <HI>Alcair, where I</HI> (saith he) <HI>upon the Market-place</HI> Bain Elkasraim, <HI>saw a Matron-like Woman coming out of a Bath, Ravish'd by one of these Fanaticks, in the presence of many people, who thereupon ran in great numbers to touch her Garment, as a Holy thing; and the Womans Husband with silence, manifested his thankfulness towards the Ravisher, by a great Feast, and liberal Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>The second sort called <HI>Cabalists,</HI> fast very severely, eat not the flesh of any living creature, but have a peculiar Dyet and Clothing. They have Set-Prayers for every hour of the day and night, according to the diversity of the Days and Moneths; and wear small square Tablets Engraven with Chara∣cters and Figures. They feign daily to converse and discourse with Angels, who, as they say, teach them the knowledge of all things. Their chiefest Teacher was one <HI>Boni,</HI> who set them Rules, and invented those Prayers and Tablets. Their Rule is divided into eight parts, the first whereof is call'd <HI>Elumha Ennonaritae,</HI> that is, <HI>the Demonstration of Light,</HI> containing their Prayers and Fast-dayes. The second, <HI>Semsul Meharif, the Sun of Sciences,</HI> wherein are the aforesaid square Tablets, with their use and advantages. The third, <HI>Lesme Elchufne,</HI> and in it a Table of the Ninety nine Vertues, which, as they conceive, are comprehended in the name of God; each other part of the eight having a particular name, and matter whereof it treateth.</P>
<P>The third sort termed <HI>Sunachites,</HI> reside in the Wildernesses like Hermits, living onely upon Herbage, and Leaves. They have a little smatch of <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Gentilism,</HI> using no Circumcision till the thirtieth year; yet they Baptize in the Name of the living God; so that they have a smack both of <HI>Christianity, Judaism,</HI> and <HI>Gentilism.</HI></P>

<P>¶ <HI>EGypt,</HI> according to <HI>Diodorus, Strabo,</HI> and others, had that Appellation from their first King, <HI>Egyptus</HI> the Son of <HI>Belus</HI> the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Monarch, who secluding his Brother <HI>Danaus,</HI> setled the Government of that Realm upon him∣self, and then Reigned sixty eight years, the Countrey before call'd <HI>Nilea, Aeria,</HI> and <HI>Osserina,</HI> though others assert this Denomination sprung from <HI>Nilus,</HI> whose antient name was <HI>Egyptus.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Countrey hath confounded Chronologers with the strange Vicissitudes and main Alterations of its Government,

<P>Such and the like instances, not improbable, intimate that the greatest part of <HI>Egypt</HI> (especially where descending from the Mountains about <HI>Gran Caire,</HI> it stretcheth down towards the Sea, lying annually under the overflowing of the <HI>Nile</HI>) rais'd its depress'd <HI>Morass</HI> from the sediments of these pudly inundations, the River leaving in his retreat the fertile plunder brought from the High Lands upon the Low Countreys, which mud and marling slime filling up stagnated ponds and plashes, when dry'd into a swarf, improv'd the soil for

<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is to be supposed that much of it was then covered with water.</NOTE> Most Writers with <HI>Aristotle</HI> concur in this assertion; and <HI>Homer</HI> also seems to hint the same, mentioning onely <HI>Thebes</HI> of this most rich and populous Countrey.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>On the Senthside of the City of <HI>Alexandria</HI> near the Lake <HI>Mareotis</HI> wherein the Sepulchres of King <HI>Maeris,</HI> and his Wife, were Pyra∣midally built with a <HI>Colossus</HI> of Stone on each side: and adjoyning thereto was the Labyrinth so sam'd, in the midst whereof were thirty seven Palaces, belonging to the thirty seven Jurisdi∣ctions of <HI>Egypt</HI> (whereof ten in <HI>Thebais,</HI> ten in <HI>Delta,</HI> and seventeen in the middle Region) unto which resort∣ed the several Presidents to celebrate the Festivals of their Gods, (who had there∣in their particular Temples; Moreover fifteen Chappels containing each a <HI>Nemesis</HI>) and also to advise of mat∣ters of importance concern∣ing the general welfare. The passages thereunto, were through Caves of a mira∣culous length, full of dark and winding pathes, and Roomes within one ano∣ther, having many doors to confound the memory and distract the intention, lead∣ing into inexplicable error; now mounting aloft, and again re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>descending, not seldom turning about, Walls insolded within one another in the form of intricate Mazes, not possible to thred or ever to get out without a Conductor.

The Chambers were so disposed, that upon their opening, the Doors did give reports no less terrible than thunder; The first entrance was of white Marble within, throughout adorn'd with Marble Columns and diversity of Figures: <HI>Dedalus</HI> was said to have imitated this in that which he built at <HI>Crete,</HI> yet expressing hereof scarce the hundredth part. Who so mounted the top, should see as it were a large plain of Stone, and withall, those thirty seven Palaces, environed with solid Pillars and Walls consisting of Stone of a mighty proportion: At the end of this Labyrinth there stood a square Pyramis of a marvellous bredth, and answerable altitude; the Sepulchre of King <HI>Ismandes</HI> that built it.

<P>There were four very eminent Labyrinths, one in <HI>Egypt,</HI> another in <HI>Lemnos,</HI> a third in <HI>Italy,</HI> and a fourth in <HI>Crete,</HI> built after the ananner of the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> to whose former Description take this addition: It was all of square polish'd Stone, every side three hundred foot broad, fifty foot high upon a square base; It had five Pyramids, one at each Corner, and one in the Middle of a hundred and fifty foot, with such a top as hath a Brazen Orbe upon it, and one covering lay'd over them all, from which hung down Bells in Chams, which stir'd by the winds, made a sound afar off, upon which Orbes there were four other Pyramids a hundrod scot high, and other things: this is delivered from <HI>Varro</HI> by <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. 36. cap. 13.</P></NOTE> Mysterious Temple or Labyrinth of theirs, which had so many Rooms, and with-drawing Apartments in it: But later Writers say, that since the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> conquer'd <HI>Egypt,</HI> they made but three divisions; the first, call'd in Arabick <HI>Nahar Alleriffe,</HI> or <HI>Erriffe,</HI> extending from <HI>Grand Cair</HI> to <HI>Rosetta:</HI> The second, <HI>Sahaid</HI> or <HI>Assahaid,</HI> signifying <HI>firm land,</HI> and reaches from <HI>Cair</HI> to the borders of <HI>Bugiha:</HI> The third, <HI>Bechria,</HI> (or according to <HI>Marmol, Beheira-Allards,</HI> that is,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or <HI>Zealand.</HI></NOTE> Sea-land) stretching along that arm of the <HI>Nile</HI> that extends to <HI>Damiata</HI> and <HI>Tenez.</HI></P>
<P>The first of these is very fertile and luxuriant in the production of Rice and all sorts of delicious Fruits: The second yields plenty of Corn, prickle Fruits, store of Cattel, Fowl, and Flax. And the third abounds with Sugar∣canes, Cotton, and other such Commodities.</P>
<P>The whole thus divided into three; each three is sub-divided into ten; as follows, in <HI>Delta</HI> or <HI>Nether Egypt,</HI> were <HI>Rakotites, Phtenuti, Phtemphuti, Mende∣fites, Omisis, Saities, Attribis, Tavites, Tarbethites, Busirites;</HI> which order and names were first constituted by <HI>Sesostris,</HI> (of whom it is recorded, that he would by cutting the <HI>Isthmus</HI> between the <HI>Mid-land</HI> and <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> have joyn'd them, had he not been diverted from the attempt by their Priests asseverations,
<PB N="43" REF="36"/>That all <HI>Egypt</HI> would of necessity be drown'd by the irruption of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> which lay higher than that Countrey did) though afterwards <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and others his Successors, made great alterations therein.</P>
<P><HI>Middle Egypt,</HI> held <HI>Memphites, Heliopolites, Bubastites, Heracleopolites, Crocodilopo∣lites, Oxyringites, Kynopolites, Hermopolites, Antinopolites,</HI> and <HI>Latinopolites.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Upper Egypt, Thebetes, Apollopolites, Panopolites, Koptites, Tentyrites, Lyco∣polites, Aphroditopolites, Latopolites, Abydene,</HI> and <HI>Anteopolites.</HI></P>
<P>The reason of this division may be two-fold, the first in regard of their diversities of Gods, and various Ceremonies in their Services, which <HI>Sesostris</HI> their Prince observing, to prevent tumultuous Seditions, alotted the Countrey into
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rather thirty seven, for the reason in the Descrip∣tion of the Labyrinth.</NOTE> thirty shares, according to the number of their Gods and Goddesses, and by this means made <HI>Egypt</HI> as it were one Universal Temple, wherein were as many <HI>Numens,</HI> as <HI>Plato</HI> hath divided the whole earth between.</P>
<P>The second cause was the Litigiousness of the people, concerning their bounds or limits, occasioned (as <HI>Strabo</HI> observeth) by the <HI>Nile</HI>'s yearly inun∣dations, whereby boundaries were not onely obscured, but even all Land∣marks and distinctions of propriety utterly washed away; which necessitated an infinite trouble in Annual Surveys; this was setled by the afore-mentioned division, each particular Governour apportioning to himself even by inches the Compass of what was committed to his charge.</P>
<P>This division of <HI>Sesostris</HI> totally differed from that made afterwards by <HI>Pto∣lomy,</HI> and by his Successors established (after the decay of that State by the <HI>Persians,</HI> under the conduct of their King <HI>Cambises</HI>) which was into forty <HI>Dy∣nasties:</HI> But this, with the remains of all the rest, were at last by the <HI>Mahume∣tans,</HI> who trampled all down, utterly subverted, yielding to the Laws and Establishments of the insulting Conqueror.</P>
<P>¶ THe Extent of <HI>Egypt</HI> is from the 21 degree of Northern Latitude,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> to the 31 degree of the same; and therefore some have judged it to contain in length fifteen days journey, and in bredth but three.</P>
<P>Others strangely over-reckon, and will have it four thousand <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, though
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Maginus. Marmol.</NOTE> <HI>Maginus</HI> will allow but five hundred and sixty common ones, which <HI>Marmol</HI> shortens much, reducing it to a hundred and fifty <HI>French</HI> leagues, therein somewhat agreeing with <HI>Cluverius,</HI> who from the <HI>Pelusian</HI> mouth of <HI>Nile,</HI> to the Town of <HI>Catabathmus,</HI> count no more than a hundred and fifty Miles.</P>
<P>In bredth, as <HI>Marmol</HI> reckons, it hath but twenty six <HI>Spanish</HI> Miles, an in∣considerable tract of Land between the shore of <HI>Nile,</HI> and the two great De∣sart Mountains, from whence the River with wonderful swiftness issueth, and thence descending to <HI>Asne,</HI> and so to <HI>Alcayro,</HI> having scarcely run a course of twenty Miles beyond it, divides it self into two Arms, which afterwards re-unite, till having run sixty Miles beyond <HI>Alcayro,</HI> it branches again into two streams, the one call'd the <HI>Canopean,</HI> passeth to <HI>Rosetta,</HI> and the other to <HI>Damiata,</HI> where by a new division, causing a great Lake, through a narrow Streight, it falleth into the <HI>Mid-land Sea,</HI> near the place where of old <HI>Tenesse</HI> was scituated.</P>
<P>These two Armsdraw or delineate the sides; and the Sea-shore, the basis of a Triangle, giving the name of <HI>Delta</HI> Δ to that most Northerly part of the Coun∣trey, call'd also <HI>Nether-Egypt,</HI> but by the Natives themselves (as <HI>Guilliam de Tyr,</HI> maintains) <HI>Mahetek.</HI> To this part <HI>Strabo</HI> assigns about three thousand <HI>Stadiums,</HI> which make three hundred seventy five <HI>Italian</HI> Miles; but this is
<PB N="44" REF="37"/>lessen'd by <HI>Maginus,</HI> to three hundred, whereas on the other hand <HI>Villamont</HI> will have its Circumference to be seven hundred Miles, setting down a great Lake at the Coast of <HI>Garbia,</HI> Eastward from the River, for one part of its Limits; and another Channel of the <HI>Nile</HI> called <HI>Katoz,</HI> that goes to <HI>Alexandria</HI> for a second. And this might cause <HI>Ptolomy</HI> to stile it <HI>Great,</HI> and sub-divide it into the lesser and third <HI>Delta.</HI></P>
<P>The Antients (as <HI>Kircher</HI> observes) named this part <HI>Fium,</HI> which in the old <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tongue, signifyed the Sea: not from its resembling the Sea in the time of its being over-flow'd; but because it is generally believed that hereto∣fore the whole surface of that part was totally covered by the Sea, until by a long Series of time, the Slime and Mud of the <HI>Nile</HI> came to settle, and at length with great labour, became firm Land. The same <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Itinerary</HI> from a certain <HI>Rabbi,</HI> affirms, that from the Patriarch <HI>Joseph</HI>'s time, many Hebrew Monuments, and old great Buildings were found there; and that after many dayes toyle and labour, by him directed, the same was made fit to be, and was actually inhabited, according to which example, succeeding Princes con∣tinually drayning the Marshy parts, made the whole Countrey useful; which thereupon became so populous and wonderfully fertile in all things, that it was named, <HI>The Gift of the Immortal Gods,</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI> relates. And the Poets tell us of a great Serpent bred hereabouts, which did much mischief to the people, till slain by
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or <HI>Apello,</HI> Ovid. <HI>Met.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hercules Egyptius,</HI> and the memory of his Atcheivement preserv'd, by naming the City (from the Serpent) <HI>Python.</HI></P>
<P>This proof of <HI>Delta</HI>'s lying under water heretofore, makes us rightly to in∣terpret <HI>Herodotus, Strabo,</HI> and others, who maintained all <HI>Egypt</HI> to have been in the same condition; whereas they must be understood by a Synechdoche, to have taken a part for the whole, for that <HI>Egypt</HI> in general was not drown'd with the Sea, will appear from hence, that it was very Mountainous, and upon a continual ascent upwards to the <HI>Nile,</HI> even as far as the <HI>Cataracts</HI> thereof, and <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>And now the Series of our Discourse, having brought us to the <HI>Nile,</HI> we will with as much brevity and exactness as possible describe the same, by dis∣covering his first rise and heads, with his several branches and sources, and setting down the Genuine causes of his annual Fluxes, from the crediblest of our Modern Authors.</P>
<P>This River famous for his greatness and faecundity,

See <HI>Virg. Georg.</HI> 2.</NOTE> hath by antiquity, many several names attributed to him. The <HI>Hebrews</HI> call him <HI>Nahar-Mitzraim,</HI> that is, <HI>the River of</HI> Egypt; the Inhabitants <HI>Nuchal,</HI> (which agrees with <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> who give the same to the Head-spring of <HI>Nile</HI>) and is but little different from the Hebrew <HI>Nahal</HI> or <HI>Nachal.</HI> 'Tis also by the <HI>Jews</HI> named <HI>Shickor</HI> or <HI>Sihor,</HI> signifying black, from the colour of the sediment; for the same reason call'd by the <HI>Greeks Melas,</HI> black. And the Antients represented his Figure in black stone, though all other Rivers were denoted by white Statues: Some would fancy this to be <HI>Gihon</HI> mentioned in Holy Writ; but with how little pro∣bability, may easily be conjectured, if we consider that <HI>Gihon</HI> was one of the four great Rivers that watered the Terrestrial Paradise, and consequently in <HI>Asia,</HI> whereas this is in <HI>Africk. Homer, Diodorus, Xenophon,</HI> and others, give him the common appellation of the Countrey, that is, <HI>Egyptus;</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> names him <HI>Osyris</HI> and <HI>Syris; Apollonius, Triton; Pliny, Astraton; Diodorus, Aquila;</HI> (because of his swiftness it seems) <HI>Cedrenus, Chrysorrhoe;</HI> (Golden stream) and <HI>Dyonisius, Syene.</HI> In the Reign of King <HI>Orus</HI> there, eight hundred years before the building
<PB N="45" REF="37"/>of <HI>Rome,</HI> the same was by his Subjects, known by the title of <HI>Noym</HI> or <HI>Num.</HI> Upon the Coasts of <HI>Lybia</HI> towards <HI>Syene,</HI> (from the name of a Princes Child there drown'd) it was first call'd <HI>Nilus,</HI> which also the <HI>Africans</HI> do; The <HI>Abyssines</HI> stile it <HI>Abanha (Father of Rivers;)</HI> The <HI>Negroes</HI> or <HI>Moors, Takkui;</HI> and from them the <HI>Abyssines, Nil Takui,</HI> and the two branches thereof <HI>Tagazi</HI> and <HI>Abanhi.</HI> Lastly, by the report of <HI>Sanutius,</HI> the people of the Kingdom of <HI>Goyame</HI> call it <HI>Gihon.</HI></P>
<P>This famous River thus severally known by variety of Names, by yearly inundations, doth so fertllize and fatten the earth, that it provides for and furnishes the Inhabitants even with an exuberance of Plenty; which proceeds from three remarkable Prerogatives, wherewith Nature hath endowed him be∣yond all other Rivers: The first is, that he sends forth no foggy vapors, which makes the Air very healthful and serene, being continually free either from Rain, Clouds, Mists, or Fogs: Secondly, he runs with so even and undi∣sturbed a stream, that there never accrews any danger from his Waves or Billows to any Boats, Barks or Passengers sailing thereon, but a satisfactory pleasure from his continual calm: Lastly, his faecundating vertue, which is so great, that it causeth not onely an infinite encrease in all sorts of Cattel that water there; and breeds a prolifick faculty in Men and Women, but produces of all things growing from the earth a Harvest plentiful even to admiration. And this fertility without dispute was the cause why <HI>Egypt</HI> of old exceeded all other Nations almost, for multitude of people, and yet to this day, after so many direful depopulations, may compare with those that boast the greatest number of Inhabitants: As a testimony whereof, <HI>Diodorus</HI> records, that there were once in it eighteen thousand strong Cities; many of which, as it seems, were either by Time or War lay'd waste and desolate, because we find in the Reign of <HI>Ptolomy Lagus,</HI> onely three thousand Registred, no more then remaining: which by <HI>Suidas</HI> his account, was in the Empire of <HI>Caesar Augustus,</HI> when <HI>Dio∣dorus</HI> lived.</P>
<P>The same Author reports, that in Elder times, the number of its Inhabi∣tants were seventeen hundred thousand; and that in his own time, they were no less in general esteem, than thirteen hundred thousand; which wonder∣ful encrease might be effected by the constant drinking the water of this River, whose vertue had the power as some believed, to make the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Women bring forth so often, not onely two or three, but sometimes six or seven, nay eight Children at a Birth. And this may a little abate the wonder how the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> in so short a time as two hundred years (
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Broughton.</NOTE> which was all the space they sojourned in <HI>Egypt</HI>) multiplyed from but seventy souls, to above six hundred thousand men on foot, besides Women and Children; nor may those stupendious Monuments of Grandeur, which even to this day bear the name of <HI>Wonders,</HI> seem so strange to have been erected by the Antient Kings of this Countrey, as a Remonstrance of their glorious Greatness and Magni∣ficence, if we lay into the other Scale the infinite number of people that were under their Commands; all whose hands at the Princes <HI>Fiat</HI> being em∣ployed, made things otherwise seeming impossible to become facile; accord∣ing to that of the Poet, <HI>Multorum manibus grande levatur opus.</HI></P>
<P>From these unusual Excellencies, and rare Qualifications of this River, the <HI>Gymnosophists</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> made it one of their chief <HI>Numens,</HI> which they worshipped with particular Solemnities, under the name of the Goddess <HI>Isis,</HI> to whose care and kindness, they ascrib'd their continual freedom from the terror and dan∣ger
<PB N="46" REF="38"/>of Earthquakes; and that they were never infested with any Pestilential Contagion, but alwayes enjoyed a Serene wholesomeness of Air, not subject to any impetuous storms or alterations of weather, either from the Clouds or Windes: This was the cause of those many honorable Epithetes bestowed on it by Antiquity; among which, one was <HI>the flowing of</HI> Osiris, or rather as <HI>Abenefius</HI> an <HI>Arabick</HI> Writer hath it, <HI>Osiris Arm;</HI> because it did as it were reach forth to Mankind so great a Plenty of Provisions: For observing that <HI>Egypt</HI> enclosed with Mountains, did resemble an Arm, and that the several par∣titions at the end, seemed Fingers, he appointed to the <HI>Nile</HI> the place of the <HI>Me∣diana</HI> or <HI>Liver-vein;</HI> This like that in the body, sending forth its quickning moisture, by whose motion and circulation, it fertilitates the whole even to such an height of abundance, as makes Wonder stand amaz'd, to see Nature turn Prodigal. This agrees well with the Antient Poets, who gave to this River many notable attributes: <HI>Homer</HI> the Prince of them, says it fell from Heaven out of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Bosome; from whence happily sprung the belief, not onely of the old <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but the later <HI>Greeks,</HI> that Heaven was its Spring∣head: This made some term him, <HI>The Gift of</HI> Jupiter; others, <HI>The Tears of the Gods; The Veins of Paradice; The Seed of the Gods; The Pond of</HI> Proteus; <HI>The Husband of the Goddess</HI> Isis, and a number of other titles of remark not unknown to the remotest Nations: So that the more ignorant <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Negroes,</HI> fre∣quently entitle it <HI>Ankaata Mazat Schamatarri,</HI> that is, <HI>The Fountain of Heavenly Water:</HI> The <HI>Arabian</HI> Poets <HI>Hunfarid</HI> and <HI>Eldeburge,</HI> stile it <HI>Giatellartim, The life of the Earth:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai.</HI> cap. 23. ver. 3.</NOTE> And the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> cap. 23. ver. 3. speaks of it in these words, <HI>By great Waters the Seed of</HI> Sihor, <HI>the Harvest of the River, is her Revenue:</HI> upon which words, the Hebrew Rabbi <HI>Eliezer</HI> thus Comments; <HI>Sihor</HI> (which is <HI>Nile</HI>) saith he, <HI>in one Moneth, by one onely over-flowing, does more than all other Rivers are able to bring to pass within a Year:</HI> Which fertility, the <HI>Greeks</HI> repre∣sented by the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Neilos;</HI> their name of <HI>Nile,</HI> which Cabalistically resolved into Arithmetical figures, maketh the compleat number of the days of the year, thus, N with them standing for sixty, E for five, I for ten, Λ for thirty, O for seventy, and Σ for two hundred; which brought into one Sum together, make just three hundred sixty five, according to the Diary number of the year.</P>
<P>Thus we see the various opinions of sundry Authors and Nations, in refe∣rence to the name of <HI>Nile;</HI> we shall surely find as great diversity of judgments as to the place from whence this famous River takes his first rise; there being hardly any thing mentioned on Record, whose beginning is so abstruse, or hath frustrated more the undertakings of the Learned.</P>

<P>And in this quest we will cursorily give some reasons why this River is most full of water, even to an overflux, when most others, whether in cold or more temperate Climes are empty, and likewise on the contrary; for the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Volsius.</NOTE> so ap∣plauded by <HI>Kircher; For</HI> (saith he) <HI>those pits on the shaking plain, as all others, are undoubtedly replenished by Rain, without which the whole Globe of the earth would become barren and unfit for habitation. No River having any peculiar fountain, from which alone it riseth, but for its rise or fall is beholding, either to excess, or want of Rain:</HI> In vain therefore do any seek for a setled Head, since each Brook and drop of Rain that falls upon the sides of Hills or Valleys, inclining downwards to the Channels, are as so many contributing mites to the encrease of a River.</P>
<P>But whether it spring from the one or other, as we see opinions differ, so we are more assured of its overflowing, whereof the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests assign'd three causes; One was the great plenty of water, wherewith <HI>Egypt</HI> naturally
<PB N="48" REF="39"/>abounded, which they endeavored to prove, because the <HI>Nile</HI> contrary to all other Rivers) overflow'd his banks in the mid'st of Summer,</P>
<P>According to that of <HI>Lucan,</HI> l. 10.</P>

<P>A second, the Ocean, from whence they supposed that superabundance of water came at that season: The third, was rain, because as <HI>Democritus</HI> writes, at that time in the Southern parts, great quantities of rain pours down; the Trade-winds driving the clouds that way. <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> a great Naturalist, holds the melting of the snow in the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Mountains as a cause, agreeing therein with <HI>Euripides.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Kircher</HI> in his Enquiries upon this subject, first makes the natural scite and disposition of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Mountains a prime, and the condition of the Chan∣nel, a second cause; but after coming more home to the point, he gives two more probable. One, when their mouths are so obstructed, they cannot dis∣charge their Water; Another, when the Channels receive more than they are wont or can contain. This later happens either through molten Snow, or the falling of excessive Rain. <HI>Thales</HI> one of the seven <HI>Grecian</HI> Sages, asserts the former opinion; <HI>Anaxagoras,</HI> and most other Philosophers, the second; and in truth the belief that the increase of Rivers proceeds from violent Rains, hath obtained the greatest credit, being manifest not onely in Countreys lying un∣der the North-Pole, but even in Mountainous parts, under the Line, such as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hills of <HI>Andes</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> and the Mountains of the Moon in <HI>Africk.</HI> These
<PB N="49" REF="39"/>great Rains come not from the Clouds, driven thither by annual Windes, but from those exhaled in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> it self, which are so much the greater as the Sun∣beams there in a perpendicular line, have the greater vigour to attract, for which reason at the Suns coming out of <HI>Gemini,</HI> the matter causing <HI>Nile</HI> to over∣flow is onely preparing; but when the Sun enters <HI>Cancer,</HI> then the <HI>Nile</HI> and other Rivers pass over their Banks; among whom the great <HI>African</HI> River <HI>Ni∣ger,</HI> then passing between mighty Mountains in <HI>West-Ethiopia,</HI> dischargeth him∣self into the Ocean.</P>
<P>With this of <HI>Kircher,</HI> agrees <HI>Odoardo Lopez,</HI> saying,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Odoardo Lopez.</NOTE> there Rains fall from the beginning of <HI>March</HI> till <HI>August,</HI> not by drops, as with us in <HI>Europe,</HI> but pouring down as it were by whole Payls or Buckets full, with such impetuousness, that they cause all streams to swell above their Banks.</P>
<P>The reasons of the overflowing of <HI>Nile</HI> being thus shewn, <HI>Kircher</HI> starts up two new Difficulties, <HI>viz.</HI> Why the mentioned Rains fall, the Sun passing the Northern Signs, and not at any other time? The second, Why the Rains which fall in the <HI>Moors</HI> Countrey do not cause the same overflowing? Or why <HI>Egypt</HI> onely in the overflowing of <HI>Nile</HI> should so much participate of it, as to seem no Land, but all Main Sea?</P>
<P><HI REND="margQuotes">As to the first, it is to be observ'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Rain falls in the <HI>Moors</HI> Countrey, when the Sun is in the North.</NOTE> that a constant effect cannot be produced without a certain and constant cause; Now the Position of the Sun, and na∣tural Scituation of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Mountains, are the chiefest and greatest cause of these Rains, and the overflowing of <HI>Nile</HI> and some other Rivers; for wise and provident Nature hath made these Mountains (especially those between the Equinoctial and the Winter Tropick in 22 degrees of Southern Latitude, and which encompass the Southerly <HI>Ethiopia</HI> on the East, South and West) to be as hollow, or concav'd Burning-glasses, which lying to the Sun in his Nor∣thern Latitude, fitly gathers and so concenters his Beams, that they reverbe∣rate such a fiery heat, as makes extraordinary Exhalations, by which, abun∣dance of thick Clouds are consequently engendred, which crouded and thrust together by the Trade-windes, at that time always Northerly, and beaten towards the capacious Receptions of the aforesaid Mountain Convexities, are dissipated thence at length by the fervent cold descending from the tops of the Hills, and so are dissolved and come pouring down in hideous Showres, or rather in Streams, Floods, or Rivers of Rain, from whence it appears that Nature hath set them as Receptacles of Vapors and Clouds: for how much the scituation of Mountains, not onely in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but also in other parts of the World, conduce to the breeding of Windes and Rain, is not strange to any who have made search into Natural Causes.</HI></P>
<P><HI REND="margQuotes">To the second, 'tis answer'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Nile</HI> overflow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> onely in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and not in the <HI>Moors</HI> Countrey.</NOTE> That the Channels of <HI>Nile</HI> are the cause of its overflowings. For as the Channels of Rivers running between the sides of Mountains are deeper, so they can swallow the greater quantity of waters, because the Mountains hinder their overflowing and running away: On the other side, where the Channels are shallow, and go through flat places and wide extended Grounds, with Banks low, the more overflowing they are sub∣ject to: The great Mountains therefore pouring down waters between their narrow Openings and Precipices into the <HI>Nile,</HI> makes it flow far and near over its shallow Channels, not able to contain that abundance; And for this reason all the flat Grounds in the <HI>Moors</HI> Countrey are subject to the like <HI>Nilian</HI> overflowings: As therefore the natural Scituation and Position of the Moun∣tains which are so conjoyn'd, as we before said, and the Plains surrounded by
<PB N="50" REF="40"/>them serving for a Laboratory as it were,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The shallowness of the banks in <HI>Egypt,</HI> a cause of the overflowing of <HI>Nile.</HI></NOTE> to make Rain in, is an infallible cause of Showres at set-times: So also must the Natural Position and Consti∣tution of the Channel of <HI>Nile</HI> be held for a certain cause of his overflowing.</HI></P>
<P>Now the reason why these Rains fall when the Sun is in the Northerly Signs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why it rains when the Sun is in the Northern Signs.</NOTE> must be attributed to Annual Winds, call'd by the Portuguese <HI>General,</HI> or <HI>Trade-Windes,</HI> which at the Suns entrance into <HI>Capricorn,</HI> come blustering out of the North, and turn the Clouds to Rain; but when the Sun passeth <HI>Libra,</HI> the An∣niversary Windes coming from the Ocean, and Countreys full of Snow in <HI>Ma∣gellanica,</HI> being very cold, the Vapours not exhaling is the Cause, there is there at that time constantly bright and clear Weather.</P>
<P>We will conclude the whole from the aforesaid <HI>Isaac Vossius,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de <HI>Nili, &amp; ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum Fluminum origine.</HI></NOTE> who saith thus: <HI>The opinion of Antient and Modern Writers, is, That the</HI> Nile <HI>first rises either out the Mountains of the</HI> Moon, <HI>or out of the great Sea</HI> Zaire; <HI>both which lye beyond the</HI> Equinoctial <HI>to the Southwards, and in that part of</HI> Africa <HI>which lyes under the Tropick of</HI> Capricorn: But
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isaac Vossius</HI> of the Ori∣ginal of <HI>Nile,</HI> and other Ri∣vers.</NOTE> he from the Portuguese Journal-books, says, <HI>That the Spring-heads of</HI> Nile <HI>lye Northward of the</HI> Equinoctial <HI>between nine and ten degrees.</HI> For the better clearing this Point, something must be said of the Seasons of the Year, and the various Alterations of the Weather in several Climates.</P>
<P>With those that inhabit beyond the Line and the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Weather, and how the Season alters in 23 de∣grees of North Latitude.</NOTE> to the three and twentieth degree and thirty minutes of North Latitude, Winter con∣tinues as long as the Sun passes through the Northern Constellations, coming on leisurely and by degrees: for when the Sun enters <HI>Taurus</HI> or <HI>Gemini,</HI> the Windes begin to rise, and some stormy short Showres to fall: when it comes into <HI>Cancer</HI> begin the lasting Rains, and continue to the end of <HI>September,</HI> but their greatest violence is while the Sun is in <HI>Leo;</HI> in which time the Rivers un∣der the Torrid Zone swell up very high, and the tops of the Hills are cover'd with Snow: When the Sun passes <HI>Scorpio, Sagittary</HI> and <HI>Capricorn,</HI> they have clear and moderate Weather, but their greatest heat is at the Suns being in <HI>Aquarius;</HI> for then are most of the Channels of the Rivers dry, and a great part of <HI>Africa</HI> choak'd up with Drowth: On the other side, with such as live between the Line and the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> to the three and twentieth degree and a half South Latitude, Winter begins at our <HI>Autumn,</HI> as we said before, from which time till the Vernal Equinox, they have lasting Rains and great Cold: Thence commences their Spring, which continues to the Suns entrance into <HI>Cancer,</HI> and thence to the Autumnal Equinox makes their Summer, so that the Sea∣sons of the Year hold the same time, though not the same method, both with them and us: And all that travel those parts never finde any other Seasons; onely the Hills sometimes cause an alteration and stop in this Law of Nature: Hence it may be supposed where every River hath its Spring-head; for such as lye Northward of the Line, overflow in <HI>July</HI> or <HI>August,</HI> whereas those to the Southward swell principally in <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February:</HI> The consequence of all is onely this, That what River stretches it self from one Tropick to another (if any such one there were to be found in the world) it must overflow twice in a year; but the <HI>Nile</HI> onely swells immediately after the Suns being in <HI>Can∣cer,</HI> and never in the Winter, so that it must be concluded, that his Spring-heads arise from those parts lying under the <HI>Artick</HI> Signs.</P>
<P>The beginning of the <HI>Niles</HI> encrease happens,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When the <HI>Nile</HI> begins to overflow in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and when in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></NOTE> according to the opinion of most Writers, on our seventeenth day of <HI>June,</HI> the Sun passing into <HI>Cancer. Pro∣sper Alpinus</HI> would seem to assign the very hour of the day (wherein this encrease was first enquired after) but that cannot be, because it happens sometimes a
<PB N="51" REF="40"/>day or two sooner or later: But in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> it begins to swell sooner, because the first Rain falls there in the beginning of <HI>June:</HI> but forwarder towards <HI>Egypt</HI> the <HI>Nile</HI> encreases but slowly as long as the Waters are low, but in <HI>June</HI> and afterwards, when thickand lasting Rain falls in <HI>Abyssinie,</HI> then his Current is mightily encreased as well in swiftness, as depth: Now when the encrease is at the height, <HI>viz.</HI> when the <HI>Nile</HI> rises to eighteen, twenty, and more cubits, then is his Current extream swift, though not so well discernable in a broad Channel, as when the Waters are shut up in a narrow; an Experiment of which may be gathered out of <HI>Francis Alvarez;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Francis Alvarez.</HI> The great swiftness of the <HI>Nile.</HI></NOTE> who speaking of a certain Arm of the <HI>Nile</HI> that flows out of the Countrey of <HI>Dobas,</HI> into the River of <HI>Takaze,</HI> says, <HI>When we lay here under the shadow of Willows to repose our selves and bait, on a dry and clear day, we heard a great Thunder, whose noise seemed to come afar off, so that we said it thundred as it used to do in</HI> India: <HI>We being then about to pack up our baggage, as we did, supposing no danger, had no sooner taken down and were folding up the Tent, where∣in we eat our Dinner, but one of our Company began to cry aloud to us, which startling made us look about, when at the same instant we saw coming with a head a great Mountain of Wa∣ters, rolling towards us with a horrible noise, and in the twinckling of an eye swallowed up some part of our ungather'd Carriage, and without doubt had swept away the Tent also, if standing, so that we were necessitated with speed to save our selves from that so sudden sur∣prizal, by climbing up the Willows: This Water poured down with such an impetuous force, as carryed with it great stones rolling, and such an amazing fragor, that the Earth shook, and the Skie ecchoed, but this as soon gone, as come. After this we betook our selves to some poor Cottages we saw scattered in the Countrey, but were driven away with stones by the In∣habitants, so that we were forced to sup, and stay all night under the Canopy of Heaven: Next day we went forward and perceived by the way Rain and Thunder, as we had the day before, but were not troubled therewith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prosper Alpinus</HI> says, The Inhabitants to foreknow the greatness of the Rivers approaching encrease, preserve a dry Clod, which at the time of the first swel∣ling grows heavier: How true soever this may be, yet it's no certain nor satis∣fying Prognostication, for if this or other tokens before-hand could verifie the completion of their hopes, then would they not concern themselves, nor be so sollicitous and diligent to mark each days encrease, and to publish it by Com∣mon Cryers.</P>
<P>¶ THere is a great Contest between Antient and Modern Writers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference about the time of its continuance.</NOTE> varying about the Time and Continuance of the increase and decrease of the <HI>Nile:</HI> The general belief is, that it rises forty days, and falls as many: <HI>Herodotus,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodotus. Diod. Sicul. Ammian. Marcell.</NOTE> Dio∣dorus Siculus, Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> and many others, say it encreases ninety or a hundred days: <HI>Aristides,</HI> longer, almost for four moneths time;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristides.</NOTE> which differ∣ences may easily be reconciled; for the Antients call'd the whole time of his In∣undation, <HI>The Encrease;</HI> whereas the Moderns say, that time onely is the En∣crease, which is between the least and greatest depth of Water; and the other wherein the Water returns into his own Channel, <HI>The Decrease.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Nile</HI> then flows by degrees from the later end of <HI>June:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How long the <HI>Nile</HI> in∣creases in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> At the first very little, scarce rising up two or three fingers in twenty four hours, nor much more any day after while the Sun remains in <HI>Cancer;</HI> but when the Sun passes into <HI>Leo,</HI> it rises first half a foot; afterwards half a foot and a palm, immedi∣ately a foot, and lastly a whole cubit almost every day, so continuing till the full height: Thus the Grounds lying near the River are first moistened, after∣wards those afar off, and at last all <HI>Egypt</HI> over; Then the Earth which a little before was dry Land, becomes Navigable; and the River (whose Channel in
<PB N="52" REF="41"/>many places was scarce broader than a Furlong, enlarges to
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Above thirty English miles.</NOTE> three hundred Furlongs; nor would it stay there, if the Hills on both sides did not curb and hinder it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nile</HI> in this expansion at his height (which ordinarily happens, the Sun in the middle of <HI>Leo,</HI> though sometimes when in the fifth or sixth degree of <HI>Libra</HI>) doth not presently decrease, but continues many times at the same depth twenty days and more, till the Sun enters <HI>Virgo,</HI> then by degrees lessening and running away; before which time all the Dikes, Ditches, and Damms are opened to receive and detain the water: Then may it easily be perceived how the Waters retire <HI>gradatim,</HI> first from the Grounds of <HI>Upper Egypt,</HI> that border up∣on <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> afterwards from the High-grounds of <HI>Lower Egppt;</HI> which naturally comes to pass, for the Water glides through the High-grounds, not running off indeed, but kept up in Ditches, that the Mud which improves the Land may be ready to be spread so much the nearer: At length after the Autumnal Equinox, the Water returns into its natural Channel; and that which was thus long by Dikes kept up in the Upper-grounds, let out by Sluices, first in <HI>Upper,</HI> and after in <HI>Lower Egypt:</HI> And although sometimes there is a difference in the rising of the <HI>Nile,</HI> according to the little or much rain falling in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> yet the whole Countrey is clear'd, and the Water return'd to its Channel before our eight and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> whereupon immediately the Grounds are ploughed with small Coulters, and made fit for Sowing, and the Countrey∣man (when the Sun enters <HI>Scorpio,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Nile</HI> almost always either increasing, or decrea∣sing.</NOTE> puts his Seed into the Earth; however, though in its own Channel, the River ceases not lessening till the end of <HI>May</HI> the next year.</P>
<P>It remains now that from this Overflowing of the <HI>Nile,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Current of <HI>Nile</HI> some∣times swift, and sometimes flow.</NOTE> we shew the swift∣ness or slowness of his Current, and how it varies at several times; for the making which appear, you are to know that in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> it flows up at least twen∣ty days, and sometimes a whole moneth ere it begins to rise in <HI>Egypt,</HI> at the beginning scarce running a league in an hour, whereas when the Water is come to the highest, it passes so swiftly forward, that if the Channel of the <HI>Nile</HI> be above four hundred and fifty leagues and more in length, as by reason of its windings and reaches, some running almost point-blank backwards, it may well be, upon an equal calculation it will appear that it may run three leagues in one hour: we must confess it is not so swift in <HI>Egypt,</HI> because the Channel is like a Sea, about ten leagues broad, which causes it necessarily to flow slower, whereas it's circumscribed and confined in narrow limits in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and so consequently goes there more swift.</P>
<P>But now to return to our quest of the Head Sources or Fountains of this fa∣mous River;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Head-Springs of <HI>Nile</HI> where, as supposed. <HI>Vossius.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Vossius</HI> gives us this account, Although the Head-springs of other Rivers are not onely in places far distant from their mouths,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It receives all its water out of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></NOTE> in regard, where Rain falls, Brooks and small Channels are usually found, which by their confluence make the great ones full; it is clear otherwise with the <HI>Nile,</HI> being onely indebted to <HI>Egypt</HI> for a passage, not receiving any addition of Waters there: for all <HI>Egypt</HI> (except where bordering on the Sea) is altogether void of Rain, but comes out of that part of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> that now is call'd <HI>Abys∣sine,</HI> so that with reason there must we look for the Head-veins of <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>Among the many Heads ascribed thereto, the farthest and most Southerly making the rivers <HI>Maleg</HI> and <HI>Anguet,</HI> which joyn in the Countrey of <HI>Da∣mut,</HI> and make the West Channel, retaining the name <HI>Maleg,</HI> till after a course of fourscore leagues, it falls into the middle Channel, accounted the chief,
<PB N="53" REF="41"/>beginning in the Hilly Countrey of <HI>Sakala,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sea <HI>Bar-Dambea.</HI></NOTE> wherein also lies the large Sea <HI>Dambea,</HI> eighty and eight leagues long, and about two hundred over, call'd <HI>Bar-Dambea</HI> by the Inhabitants, first falling in the Countrey of <HI>Bagameder,</HI> thence gliding forward through the Regions of <HI>Amaharam, Olekam, Gauz, Bizamo,</HI> and <HI>Gongos,</HI> and increased by the addition of other Rivers, turns towards the North, visiting the Fields of <HI>Fasculo,</HI> at last intermingling with the River <HI>Ma∣legt,</HI> where it borders upon <HI>Nubia.</HI></P>
<P>The third Channel is the rich River <HI>Takaze,</HI> rising from three Springs on the borders of the Kingdom of <HI>Angola,</HI> whence after a Western course between <HI>Daganam</HI> and <HI>Haogam,</HI> it winds towards the North, by the Kingdom of <HI>Tygre,</HI> and dividing the Region of <HI>Syre,</HI> turns Eastward. Afterwards falling into the River <HI>Mareb</HI> or <HI>Marabo,</HI> which begins near <HI>Baroa,</HI> they joyntly water the Countrey of <HI>Dengiri,</HI> call'd by the Moors (who enjoy it) <HI>Ballai,</HI> and unites at last with the <HI>Nile</HI> by the City <HI>Jalak.</HI> There are the three Rivers, which principally make up the <HI>Nile,</HI> and enrich his Bosome with such plentiful Streams. Thus far have we traced the opinions of <HI>Kircher</HI> and <HI>Vossius:</HI> Now we proceed to declare what the Cataracts thereof be, divers having written strange things thereof.</P>
<P>But first as to the name, It is call'd by <HI>Pliny</HI> and other Latine Authors, and by the people also who live thereabouts, <HI>Catadupae,</HI> and by the present Inhabitants, <HI>Katadhi,</HI> which in their Tongue signifies <HI>A Rushing Noise:</HI> This happens at the Hill <HI>Gianadel,</HI> where his even Current is broken by the sharp rocks, through or over which it makes passage: The place of this Fall, according to the An∣tients, contains
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Above six miles.</NOTE> fifty Furlongs, filled up with huge and inaccessible rocks, over which the <HI>Nile</HI> making his way, falls with such an impetuous force, and prodigious noise, that as the Antients write, the people who dwell thereabouts were all deaf by reason thereof: But Experience now adays hath taught us, that this Noise hath no such effect, whilst the River keeps his usual stream, but when he begins to rise, the Noise encreases, but yet is never so great that peo∣ple should loose their hearing by it; Though 'tis true, the Waters rush down∣wards two hundred foot, roaring like the Breaches of the Sea in a Tempest; from hence then sliding in a gentle Current over the Plains of <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Cairo,</HI> where the Haven of <HI>Bulach</HI> towards <HI>Villamont,</HI> carryes in bredth two mile, then leaving <HI>Cairo</HI> behinde him, he parts into two, and after into more Branches: The Inhabitants for distinction sake, have call'd the Tract of Land Eastward, <HI>Garbiah;</HI> and the places Southward near the Angle or Point of <HI>Damiata, Chargnia.</HI></P>
<P>These Branches or Arms, make the several Mouthes of <HI>Nile,</HI> which the An∣tients have especially noted to be seven; But <HI>Ptolomy</HI> sets down nine, which two are missing: and <HI>Pliny</HI> encreases them to eleven, whereof four are wanting: The names of the supposed seven remaining are these, The <HI>Heraclean,</HI> call'd al∣so <HI>Canopean,</HI> and <HI>Naucratian;</HI> The <HI>Bolbitian; Sebennitian; Pathmetian,</HI> by <HI>Strabo</HI> nam'd <HI>Fatnian,</HI> and by

<P>About this City, but chiefly towards <HI>Cario,</HI> there groweth in the Ditches a Plant call'd <HI>The Egyptian Plomp</HI> or <HI>Lotus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lotus,</HI> a Plant.</NOTE> in such an abundance, that the Leaves, resembling those of the Water-lillies, cover the whole Channel; The Egyp∣tians call the Flower with its Stalk <HI>Arais el Nil:</HI> the Leaf with the Stalk, <HI>Bush-nyl,</HI> and the Root <HI>Biarum.</HI> This Plant hath the property of growing exactly as high as the Water in the Ditches, and opens his Flowers not underneath the Wa∣ter, but above it: 'tis certainly true, that it turns about with the Sun, though the Antients disputed it.</P>
<P>This Plant for its near resemblance to a Water-lilly, <HI>Prosper Alpinus</HI> was de∣ceiv'd in taking it for the very same, though afterwards in his Book of <HI>Forrain Plants,</HI> he retracted his opinion: Every Leaf hath a single Stalk growing out of the Root, which is thick, long, and round, in shape resembling a small Pear, the biggest sometimes as large as a Hens Egg: On the outside black, and full of Fibres, within yellowish and very pelpy, and hard, and sharp in taste on the tongue: The Flowers are large like white Water-lillies, as we said; where∣of every one grows on the top of a green and round Stalk, smelling like a Pink: After the Flowers follow round green Cods, containing in distinct bags a sort of Seed, not unlike that of a Cabbage: After the Earth hath drunk up the Water of <HI>Nile,</HI> and is dried up, immediately the Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit, wither and dye.</P>

<P>In this Quarter of <HI>Egypt,</HI> is, first on the East of <HI>Beheyra,</HI> the Cape or Point of <HI>Brule,</HI> in former times known by the name of <HI>Pineptimi,</HI> and by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> taken for one of the <HI>Nilian</HI> Mouths; it is enclosed in the form of a Haven, and re∣ceives the water, shooting out of the Eastern Arm of the <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from thence lyeth <HI>Damiata,</HI> or <HI>Damiette,</HI> by <HI>Nicetas</HI> in his Journals of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> taken for <HI>Tamiathim;</HI> but by the Antients for <HI>Pelusium,</HI> and by <HI>Ste∣phanus</HI> for <HI>Tamiates: Guilandinus</HI> will have it be <HI>Tanis,</HI> spoken of in the Holy Scripture; but <HI>Auchard</HI> distinguishes <HI>Tanis</HI> and <HI>Damiata,</HI> making <HI>Tanis</HI> the same with <HI>Tenex</HI> or <HI>Tenez,</HI> which hath given the name to the <HI>Tanitian</HI> Mouth.

<PB N="64" REF="49"/>of the <HI>Nile,</HI> the waters are let in to moisten the thirsty Lands, in the time of Drowth. In these Trenches grows a Weed that moves to and fro upon the water, resembling that we call <HI>Ducks-Meat,</HI> or <HI>Ducks-Madder,</HI> without Stalk or Root, shooting downward, onely many small strings and threds: The Leaves are of a pale green, like those of Dogs-tongue, but shorter, broader, thicker, whiter, more bristly and stinging. This Plant is the true <HI>Stratiotes, Milfoyl,</HI> or <HI>Souldiers-Herb</HI> of the Antients, having Leaves like Houseleek,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water House-leek.</NOTE> and is therefore call'd by the Egyptians, <HI>Hay-alem-Emovi,</HI> that is, <HI>Water House-leek:</HI>

<P><HI>Beauvais</HI> reckons here six thousand and eight hundred remarkable Mosques,

<P>There are also several Hospitals and Almes-houses, one of which hath the yearly Revennue of an hundred thousand Sultanies or Turkish Crowns, where all manner of Wounded Souldiers and Sick people are received, and with great care attended by Skilful Chirurgeons and expert Physitians, for the recovery of their healths.</P>
<P>Within the City is a great piece of Land, containing about ten Acres, so fruitful that it is yearly sown, and never lyes fallow: There also is the <HI>Besestan</HI> or Market-place, where all sorts of fine Wares and Merchandize are sold: Some Writers say the Citizens reckon about eighteen thousand Streets,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of Streets.</NOTE> which others encrease to six and twenty thousand, all which have several names, and in the Evening for preventing Tumults and Uproars, are lock'd up by their own attending Porters; they are very long, but narrow: The Houses are small, but stand so close in some places, that there is scarce room to go between them, much less any convenient passages, and in the Evening are shut up with the same care and diligence as the City gates.</P>
<P>Without the City runs a long Street,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Circassiers</HI> Street.</NOTE> taking name from the <HI>Circassiers</HI> or <HI>Mamaluckes,</HI> who formerly therein us'd to exercise the Riding of Horses, and to present other Shews: This opens into a plain inclosed with Walls with∣in, which is a stately walk adorn'd with Flower Pots and open Spaces, where∣by whatever's done in the Street or Plain, may be seen: The Windows in stead of Iron Grates, have Stones with several holes made in them, for the conve∣nience of Women, who then, may peep through and see all that passes or is done in the Street, without being seen.</P>
<P>Moreover,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Street with Mosques.</NOTE> there is another long and broad Street, wherein are convenient and handsom Mosques, though small: Adjoyning to every of which, stands a
<PB N="69" REF="53"/>Garden, on one side appearing stately Monuments made after the Turkish manner, which they say, the <HI>Circassiers</HI> built for their own private Devotion, and there each set forth his Burying-place for himself and Family: This Street is one of the most Stately Remarks in <HI>Cairo,</HI> being very broad, and above a thousand paces long, and all the Palaces and Mosques adorned with high Towers; but lying so far distant from the City, 'tis not inhabited, but as it were utterly waste.</P>
<P>Over this City, a Castle or Fort raises his head standing upon a Rock,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle.</NOTE> to which the ascent is by a great and wide pair of Stairs: The form of it is cir∣cular, but so capacious, that it seems almost a City of it self, encompassed with slight old-fashion'd Walls, with Turrets and Battlements betwixt: The Dwellings within afford a most pleasing Retirement, because from every quar∣ter may be seen all within and without the City, and from the top, as from the height of the Pyramid, the Eye may sport it self over the low and level Plain: And the Stately Chambers, Banquetting and With-drawing Rooms, yet to be seen, plainly evidence the Pomp and Grandeur of the Soldans and Mamaluckes: For so long as their Kingdom flourish'd, this was a most beau∣tiful place, the Califfe or Soldan having therein his Throne of Massy Gold, himself seldom or never seen, except a little while to some Embassadors; round the Wall runs a Marble ledge a foot broad: The Gates and Windows enchac'd with Mother of Pearl, Ebony, Christal, and Coral, and all the rest very Arti∣ficial painted, and richly gilt.</P>
<P>¶ FRom <HI>Cairo</HI> also set forth the Turkish Pilgrims,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha.</HI></NOTE> which annually travel in Caravans to <HI>Mecha,</HI> to visit <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Sepulchre. This is the Head City of <HI>Arabia Felix</HI> lying by the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> Eight days Journey from which is <HI>Medina,</HI> where is <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb; to which out of <HI>Egypt</HI> once a year in <HI>November,</HI> go sometimes twelve or fifteen, nay, sometimes forty thousand Pilgrims to offer ac∣cording to their ability, Sacrifice and Burnt-Offerings to their Prophet. Over the whole Caravan, one Superior Commander is appointed, call'd <HI>Hamirag,</HI> who leads them under the conduct and safe-guard of three hundred Souldiers, fur∣nish'd with Bows and Musquets to <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> and without much delay and hindrance brings them back to <HI>Cairo</HI> (except sometimes assaulted, hurt, plundered, and slain by the Arabians in the Wilderness.) The number of Camels attending this great Company, are accounted by some sixty, and by others ninety thousand. The Grand Seignior, alone, bestows upon this Pilgrimage without accounting particular expences of the people, six hundred thousand Duckets, a fourth part of the whole Revenue of <HI>Egypt;</HI> for many poor people and Beggars go thither on foot without any Money or Provision, for whom the Grand Seignior causes many Camels to be furnish'd, to be rea∣dy in case of sickness, faintness, or weariness.</P>
<P>Each person must provide himself of all Necessaries, even to Water,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of setting forth.</NOTE> because in the whole way there is scarce any to be found: Before the Caravan sets forth, all the Pilgrims and Waggons are to be viewed and searched, which in good order passing quite through <HI>Cairo</HI> from the Castle where the Bashaw dwells, draw forth out of the City-gates into an open Field, where they wait one for another, and sometimes above eight days are spent before they are all gotten together.</P>
<P>Before the Caravan, march the Troops of Horse, or Cavalcade, follow'd by the chief Bakers, Cooks, Smiths, Sutlers, and other Artificers, each having a Camel laden with Necessaries needful for their Journey. Then
<PB N="70" REF="54"/>follow the Horses of the <HI>Hamiragh,</HI> or Superior Commander, some of which carry Vessels of water, others several necessary things to be used on the way: After these Horses, two Camels, who are to draw Waggons or Chariots, ac∣companyed with a great number of other Camels, some with Burthens, and some without, in time of need to carry the poor and those that are Sick, as we mentioned before; after that a great number of other Camels belonging to persons of Quality, and many Musquettiers and Pilgrims on foot, follow∣ing the Janizaries that are bravely set out with Musquets, and with Plumes in their Turbants; then the Commander of the Carravan, and other Voluntier Vo∣taries: Last of all, a small Pavilion of Silk stitch'd with Gold, is carried upon a Camel, by which he so becomes infranchis'd, and for ever after freed from bearing burdens, and honored with a stately Caparison thrown over him at the Tomb of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> from thence attended with many other Camels in great number, all in a rich and curious manner Equipped and Harnessed.</P>
<P>In this Order these Votary Travellers set on together, under the conduct of the <HI>Hamiragh,</HI> towards <HI>Mecha,</HI> and from thence back to the Grave at <HI>Medina,</HI> which they perform in threescore days time: Beyond <HI>Mecha,</HI> which is under the Turks obedience, an Arabian Prince rules by the name of <HI>Seriffe,</HI> which all assume that derive themselves from <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Stock, and by Records and Wri∣tings can shew their Relation by Consanguinity. This Prince commands ten thousand Horse, and twenty thousand Foot Souldiers, wherewith suddenly upon report of the Pilgrims approach to his Borders, he goes out to the Moun∣tains, and there stays till the Pilgrims return, which is twenty days after; which flying of this <HI>Seriffe,</HI> is for fear of the Turks, by this means preventing any snare that may intrap him, or otherwise.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignior has from this <HI>Seriffe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents sent from the <HI>Se∣riffe</HI> to the Grand Seignior.</NOTE> several Presents every year sent to himself, as a <HI>Golden

<P>This Plant shoots forth upon strait, round, and hairy Stalks, where from one and the same joynt grow two Leaves, one small, the other great, having long Stalks beset with whitish hairs: The Leaves in shape resemble <HI>Lousy∣weed,</HI> and different from those of <HI>Bammia</HI> onely in bigness: The Flowers are almost like the <HI>Bammian,</HI> and shoot forth between the Body and Stalk of the Leaves, succeeded by round blackish Cods, which include a small, black, bitterish Seed, smelling as strong as Musk.</P>
<P>The whole Plant is hot almost in the first degree, having a slimy Moisture;

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamarinde.</NOTE> which in brief, (although the <HI>East-Indies</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> is the proper Countrey thereof) for its manifold uses in <HI>Egypt,</HI> we will here describe.

<P>The Balsam-tree shoots very high with few Leaves, which as <HI>Dioscorides</HI> saith,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form of a Balsam∣tree.</NOTE> are of a green colour, whitish, and do not fall off in winter: The Wood is gummy, cleaving to the fingers, smelling well, and light, outwardly of a reddish colour; the Branches are long, straight, rough, and full of Leaves without order, and some like the Leaves of a Mastick-tree. The Blossoms are small, growing in form of a Coronet, five on every Stalk, of a pleasing Scent, though fading in a little time: After the Blossoms follow yellow sweet-scented Seeds, inclosed in a reddish-black bladder, wherein is a moisture like Honey; It is bitterish, and a little sharp upon the tongue, and of the same shape and bigness with the fruit of the Turpentine-tree, in the middle thick, and at the ends pointed.</P>
<P><HI>Opo-balsamum</HI> in the summer drops from the slit of the insected Barks of these Trees; as soon as it cometh into the Air it becomes whitish, afterwards green,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Opa-balsamum,</HI> what it is,</NOTE> then of a Gold Colour, lastly paler: The strained Balsam is at first clear, but becomes instantly thick and cloudy, and when old, groweth like Turpen∣tine; when it first drops it is of so strong a smell, as causeth in many the Head-ache, and in some causes a sudden bleeding at the Nose; but this sharp and strong savour at length changes into a pleasant scent, which in old Balsam is so weak that you can hardly discover any smell at all.</P>
<P>Observe here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Balsams comes not out of the Bark, or Rinde.</NOTE> That all the Balsam brought over from <HI>Cairo</HI> in Flaskets and Leathern-bottles, though it be very odoriferous, yet it is no pure Liquor or Gum issuing from the bark of the Tree, as aforesaid, but is drawn out of the Wood and green Branches by boyling, which yet is not all retained pure, but frequently adulterate with <HI>Cyprus Turpentine.</HI> They press another sort of Balsam out of the Seed, which is many times sold for right, though not so strong∣scented and bitter in taste.</P>
<P>There is no Medicine in more esteem,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its use.</NOTE> or greater use with the Egyptians than this; for they apply it almost against all Diseases proceeding from Cold, Moi∣sture, or Poison, curing with it all Wounds that are not deep, and accompa∣nied with fractured Bones or cut Sinews, in a short time.</P>
<P>It heals also all venomous bitings of Serpents and Scorpions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Universal or Catho∣lick Medicine.</NOTE> either taken in∣wardly, or spread upon the Wound; It is an extraordinary Preservative against the Plague, taking half a quarter of an Ounce inwardly. It drives away all inveterate Agues and Feavers that proceed from Putrifaction, cleanseth all un∣concocted and cold Humors and inward Obstructions, if daily a quarter of an ounce be taken inwardly: Very operative in opening Oppilations and con∣cocting indigested and superfluous Humors: It restores lost Sight, and Hear∣ing, if it be dropt warm into either of the offended parts: It is a very power∣ful Medicine against all Cramps derived from Cold and Moisture, against the Vertigo or diziness of the Head, the Falling-sickness, Lameness, Palsie, sha∣king of the Limbs, Cough, stoppings of the Chest, Consumption of the Lungs, a weak Stomach, difficulty of Breathing, Fits of the Mother, stopping of the Courses, the Whites, stopping of the Urine and the Collick; the Stone
<PB N="76" REF="59"/>in the Bladder and Reins it powerfully breaks and dissipates.</P>
<P>Those Women that will anoint themselves go first into a warm Stove,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Balsam a <HI>Fucus</HI> for women.</NOTE> and when with this throughly heated, they dab and spread this Unguent on her naked Breast and Face many times, continuing an hour or longer in the Stove, till the Skin hath drunk it in and is become dry: then she comes forth and doth her accustomed business, her Brest and Face remaining so befucus'd at least three days without washing or cleansing; the third day after she goeth into the same Stove again, and anoints her Face and Brests in the same maner many times over and thick; Thus sometimes, they anoint themselves ten times or oftner in a day, staying so long between each anointing till the Skin is become so dry, that the following Balsam may the better take place: This some of them con∣tinue at least thirty days, in all which time they never wash or wipe the Skin, as we said, then at length they wash it after being anointed with Oyl of Bitter-Almonds mixt with Water extracted from Field-bean-flowers, and so cleanse themselves many days successively.</P>
<P>The Seeds and green Branches also are used against all Distempers that the Balsam it self is: The same Vertue is ascribed to the Wood, but the Bal∣sam works most strongly, term'd by the Greeks <HI>Opo-Balsamum;</HI> The Seeds or <HI>Carpo-Balsamum,</HI> more gently; and the Wood or <HI>Xylobalsamum,</HI> the weakest of all. The Arabians also use Balsam, both the Fruit and Branches in many Medi∣cines, and against many Diseases.</P>

<P>The three first and greatest very handsomly described by Prince <HI>Radzovil,</HI> and <HI>Peter Belloon,</HI> are seen in the way to <HI>Cairo,</HI> together with many other, standing about twelve thousand paces from <HI>Nilus,</HI> on the West side in the mid∣dle of a barren and sandy Plain.

<P>¶ THe first and greatest Pyramid, according to <HI>Belloon,</HI> hath on every side at the ground from one corner to the other, three hundred and fifty paces: If we imagine the square sides of the Basis, four equilateral Triangles mutually propending, till they all meet on high, as it were in a point; then we shall have a true notion of the just Dimensions and Figure of this Pyramid; the <HI>Perimeter</HI> of each Triangle comprehending 2079 feet, and the <HI>Perimeter</HI> of the Basis 2772. whereby the whole <HI>Area</HI> of the Basis (to proportion it to our mea∣sures contains 480249. square feet, which make 693. by the English Standard; eleven English Acres of ground, according to the Measure taken by Mr.

All
<PB N="78" REF="63"/>the Stones of this stupendious Fabrick are of one bigness, <HI>viz.</HI> three foot long, and two foot broad and thick. The North side is much more worn out by Time, than the rest, because the North-wind, which in other places is dry, is moist in <HI>Egypt,</HI> by reason of the Night-dews, insomuch that it is hollowed or eaten in, whereas the other parts to the East, South, and West, are plain: The Spire or Top, which seems to end in a point, is plain and square, each side containing two and twenty foot, so that fifty men may stand upon it with ease: <HI>Pliny</HI> indeed makes it twenty five;

<P>In the mid'st of it is an Arch'd Entrance,

<P>This way is not to be passed without Torch-light, there being no Windows or Loop-holes to let in the light, descending almost two hundred paces, cut out between four even ranges of Stones, each five and twenty or thirty hand∣fuls broad, whereof one row makes the Vault; the other the floor, and the two remaining, the sides of the Walk.</P>

<P>Out of this Chamber runs up another way,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another steep way.</NOTE> by a very steep ascent, wherein is a Vault, after the manner of Italian-Vaulted Stairs, arch'd over. 'Tis square, and made of great and smooth Stones, the upper sticking out a little beyond the lower, till by degrees they almost meet, leaving only a small pas∣sage: This way they climb up by Stones, that stick out in several places, upon which laying their Hands, and setting their Feet in gaps made on purpose, each distant six hands bredth from the other, the Visitants with incredible la∣bor and pains creep up.</P>
<P>At the end of this steep way is another Chamber with a lofty Roof,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Chamber with a Burying-place. <HI>Piramidographia Mr. Greaves,</HI> pag. 94.</NOTE> and a Burying-place therein, standing across the mid'st: This Room according to Mr. <HI>Greaves,</HI> is seventeen feet and
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">190 parts of 1000 of a foot.</NOTE> somewhat more broad; and thirty four feet and
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">380 of 1000 parts of a foot.</NOTE> three inches long, cover'd with seven very great and large Marble Stones, which with the corners and sides, lying one against another, make a flat Roof: The Grave lyeth open without any Tomb-stone, as if it had been broken up, or rather never had been cover'd, because the Inhabitants say,
<PB N="79" REF="63"/>the Kings who built this Pyramid, were not Inter'd there: There is in that Chamber, a very great Tomb, cut out of one entire Marble Stone, hollow within; such <HI>Beloon</HI> calls <HI>Theban</HI> Stones, so hard and firm, that they cannot be broken by any force; but being struck upon with a Hammer or another Stone, it sounds as loud as a great Bell; Some that have seen these Stones, say they are hollow within, four fingers thick, twelve hand-bredths long, five broad, and five and a half deep.</P>
<P>The second Pyramid is much less, having no steps on the outside,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Pyramid.</NOTE> so that men cannot climb upon it. At a distance these lesser Pyramids, standing on the advantage of an higher ground, seem greater; but the contrary is experienced as you approach nearer: This, as the first, is square with a pointed Spire so sharp, that one man cannot stand upon it: The North side hath suffer'd much by the unkindness of the weather.</P>
<P>The third is much less than the two first,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Pyramid.</NOTE> upon which appear no signs of decay: It is a third part bigger than that standing upon the Hill <HI>Testaceo</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> by the way from <HI>Ostia:</HI> The whole Structure stands yet so handsome and undefaced, and free from cracks or flaws, as if it were new made.</P>
<P>Not far from the greatest Pyramid appears a Head of a wonderful form and greatness: Antient and Modern Writers call'd it <HI>Sphynx; Herodotus,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sphynx.</HI></NOTE> Andro-Sphynx;</HI> because it had the Face of a Man, and the Body of a Lyon, as Anti∣quity us'd to set forth this Monster: Many have endevour'd to undermine this Statue, but without success; because the Sand round about rising, the <HI>Sphynx</HI> is sunk into it, almost up to the Shoulders: It is of one entire firm Stone, and the form of the Face, Nose, Eyes, Mouth, Forehead, Chin and other parts so well done,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin.</HI> lib. 35. c. 12.</NOTE> that it may be conceived to be wrought with great Art and Skill. <HI>Pliny</HI> writes of it thus: <HI>Near the Pyramids stands a</HI> Sphynx, <HI>heretofore a rural Deity to the Inhabitants, who suppose King</HI> Amasis <HI>was Buried therein.</HI> Which happily might occasion and give authority to the forming its Body into the shape of a Lyon; because as <HI>Gesner</HI> relates,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gesner.</NOTE> the said King <HI>Amasis</HI> was transform'd into a Lyon; Of which Transformation of his,

<P>This <HI>Sphynx,</HI> the supposed Sepulchre of King <HI>Amasis,</HI> is of one entire natural Stone, smooth and polish'd, the Head taking up in Circumference a hundred and two foot; the length of the Body an hundred and three and forty, and in depth from the Neck to the Crown, sixty and two.</P>
<P>Writers concerning this Structure, feign wonderful things; as first, that it gave Responses to Inquirers like an Oracle; though many say, the Priests feigned and delivered them in manner following: They made a way under the Earth to the Belly and Head of it, by which going into the Image, they spake at set∣times out of the Head, whatsoever they would, giving answer to such as came to ask Councel in difficult matters: The inward hollowness or cavities were
<PB N="80" REF="64"/>made with such subtilty, that the Voice therein finding no other passage than the large gaping of the Mouth, first rumbling, at last with great force burst forth, whereby the credulous Heathens, who stood before it silent and amazed, took it for no less than the voice of a Deity, and by that extraordinarily led on to the adoration of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sphynx</HI> was represented in a two-fold manner by the Egyptians,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sphyux</HI> tepresented in a two-fold manner.</NOTE> to wit, either in the shape of a Couchant Lyon upon a Throne, or in the form above-men∣tioned: By the first was signifyed <HI>Momphta</HI> an Egyptian Deity, ruling over the Waters, and the Tutelar Guardian for the over-flowing of <HI>Nile:</HI> And by the second, the increasing of <HI>Nile</HI> it self; they made these shapes, not that they did believe such manner of living Creatures were ever in being; but to signifie how much harder than we can express are the several Dictates of the minde: <HI>Sphynx</HI> then so formed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnifyeth.</NOTE> signifies <HI>Nilus</HI> watering and fertilizing <HI>Egypt,</HI> while the Sun passed through <HI>Leo</HI> and <HI>Virgo;</HI> which the Egyptians, being very Learned and naturally addicted to Hieroglyphicks, observing, were easily induced under that biformed shape, which they call'd <HI>Sphynx,</HI> to represent their meaning, and in course of time they became adored Idols, signifying <HI>Nilus.</HI></P>
<P>There were according to <HI>Pliny,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> many of these <HI>Sphynxes</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> standing in the most famous places; those especially, which were watered by the River, as in <HI>Heliopolis</HI> and <HI>Sais,</HI> and the Wilderness of <HI>Memphis</HI> or <HI>Cairo,</HI> where that by us described the greatest of all remains yet to be seen. <HI>Aben Vaschia</HI> an Arabian speaking of these <HI>Sphynxes,</HI> says thus: <HI>For the signification of the fruitful nature of</HI> Ni∣lus, <HI>they set that Structure representing a Lyon, because that overflowing, that fructifies their whole Countrey, they receive from the bounty of the Constellation, the Lyon every year:</HI> And from them it is also by a pretty mistake, looking at them onely as Orna∣ments introduced here in <HI>Europe,</HI> to make or adorn the Pipes, Spouts, Conduits, and Pumps, with Lyons heads.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sphynxes</HI> were set by the Antients before their Temple Gates, to signifie their teaching Divine matters consisted in Wisdom, which lay hid under Aenig∣maes, or Mysterious Parables.</P>
<P>Distant from these Pyramids about a thousand paces,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pyramids call'd <HI>Mummies.</HI></NOTE> lye others call'd <HI>Mummies,</HI> because scituate in a Sandy Countrey where the Mummies are found; the greatest of all lying in this place, Spires high into the Air, and much more beautiful than any of the rest there, though almost of the same form; the outer part by length of time is much defaced, so that the steps thereof being broken, it is almost impossible to climb up to the top.</P>
<P>The Entrance of this Pyramid lyes open from the upper part downward, but the way within is so ruinous and choak'd up with Stones, that it is scarce passable without creeping, which to the Visitors, because of the falling down of other loose Stones, often proves dangerous.</P>
<P>Below there appears a very spacious and high Chamber, appointed as they say, for a Burying-place, in which is a little Door opening into another as large Chamber, built after the same manner: Neither of these have any In∣ter'd Corps, either perhaps because none were there Buried, or else the Burying-places are totally defaced: Out of these two Chambers, wherein a decayed Gate lyeth, goes a rising way, not to be ascended without a Ladder, and here∣in, the people say, is a Burying-place.</P>
<P>Of several that travelled into <HI>Egypt</HI> to see the Pyramids, and have described them, Prince <HI>Radzovil</HI> merits the chief place, having written thereof in his Book of Travels, exactly to this effect.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="64"/>
<Q><P>An hour before break of day we went out of our Lodgings,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Radzovil.</HI></NOTE> and walking continually along by Gardens, we came into the Old
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cairo.</NOTE> City, distant from the New half a mile, two hours after Sun-rising we cross'd the <HI>Nile,</HI> where having gone about two Furlongs, we came to the <HI>Pyramids;</HI> whereof, because much hath been written by others, I will in brief set down what I my self have seen.</P>
<P>Most Writers affirm, that the City <HI>Memphis</HI> mentioned in Holy Scripture,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Memphis</HI> here thought to be scituate.</NOTE> was formerly seated in this place, whereof all the remaining Tokens are but some ruinous Heaps to the south, cover'd over with dry &amp; barren Sand: there may be seen still undefaced Pyramids, whereof two greater, and a third less, erected, as they say, by that famous Lady of Pleasure <HI>Rhodope,</HI> which is singu∣larly fair, but not above sixty or seventy cubits high; these three are very hand∣som and undecayed, accounted among the Worlds Wonders, even by the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> as <HI>Martial</HI> the Epigrammatist observes:
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Barbara Pyramidum sileant miracula</HI> Memphis.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Thy wondrous Pyramids</HI> Memphis <HI>boast</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">no more.</NOTE></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The two least are of an incredible bigness, yet exceeded by the third, which is said to have in height, breadth, and length, three hundred Cubits; It hath within artificial and broad Steps, by which you may, as also by Steps without, climb to the top; There are likewise places fit for Visitants to retire and ease themselves in, two whereof more large were the Burying-places of the Kings; in the lower of which there stands yet extant a very great Sepulchre.</P>
<P>Also by what Kings, how great Cost, in what way, or by what strange Art, and whether by the <HI>Israelites</HI> during their bondage in <HI>Egypt,</HI> (which is the opi∣nion of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">With how little reason it may be imagined, that the <HI>Israelites</HI> should build these Pyramids, may appear, in that they are built of stone, whereas their employment was all in Brick-work.</NOTE> some Writers) these Structures were erected, or by others who dig'd the Trenches &amp; Passages wherein <HI>Nilus</HI> runs (for it appears that all these works were not by Nature, but made by Art) I leave to Historiographers to deter∣mine: We may rather wonder why they were erected upon a rising Rock consisting of one sort of Natural Stones, whereas they, for as much as is dis∣cernable, are inade up of many kindes: Neither is it easie to apprehend, or conceive from whence, or by what means so great a quantity of im∣mense Stones, each more than a Cubit and a half, and two Cubits broad, could be convey'd thither, <HI>Nilus</HI> lying distant little less than four miles:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first and greatest Py∣ramid.</NOTE> The greatest of them is built of quadrangular stones, rising <HI>Instar Montis,</HI> like a Mountain, by singular Art: and although it appear in a square form all along to the very top, yet these four-square stones are set in so uniform an order, that the whole Structure seems to represent the form of a Picked Hill: The going up, by rea∣son of the thickness and bigness of the stones, is difficult and toylsom, yet feisi∣ble; for though I my self used a competent endeavor, I could not in an hour and half ascend to the top, which is flat, and ten Cubits on each side.</P>
<P>The second Pyramid is a little less than the first,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Pyramid.</NOTE> and about two Bowes shot from it, without any entrance into it: On the out-side you may climb half way up, the stones being so fitted on purpose, as in the former, but a little leveller and smaller: Near the middle way they lye so even, that it is impossible to climb any higher; and this smoothness which seems to be done on purpose, reaches to the height of several cubits, which if it could be passed, from thence to the top, being one third part of the Pyramid, the stones lying carelesly and uneven, you might as well be able to climb up to the top of it, as of the afore∣mention'd Pyramid.</P>
<P>The third lying next <HI>Cairo,</HI> was erected, as we said, by <HI>Rhodope,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Fyramid.</NOTE> made wholly of sloping stones, so that there is no climbing up: Three Bowes shot from it on the one side toward the City standeth a Head, suppos'd of that Concubine,
<PB N="82" REF="65"/>with a long Neck and large Arms, seven Cubits high, and cut out of one entire Stone. Some imagine that out of the first great Pyramid which we entred, by a hollow Passage under ground through a firm Quar, which we saw arch'd over with stone, a small and secret Entrance came into this Head, and from thence (so is the common fame) by the mouth of that Head Oracles delivered.</P>
<P>In the Pyramids were Tutelar or Guardian Images,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guardian Idols call'd <HI>Se∣rapes.</HI></NOTE> by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> call'd <HI>Serapes,</HI> and by them placed there for the protection of the Corps, and to carry the Souls to their Heavenly mansions: They were graven from the bot∣tom to the top with various <HI>Hieroglyphicks;</HI> Among others were found two such Images of a Man and a Woman, both adorn'd with Caps and Ear-lappets, made of black <HI>Thebane</HI> Stones, thick above, and small beneath: They stood upon a broad Pedestal in the Countrey of <HI>Sahid,</HI> not far from the <HI>Red Sea</HI> in a Pyramid, wherein Age on one side had made an In-let, through which some Turks climbing had taken them out, each of which weighed almost Eight hundred Pounds: The Turks opinion'd that formerly the Kings of this Coun∣trey worship'd these Images, and had commanded the like to their Subjects, who after their death here buried their Princes together with their Idols: They were both heretofore graven with Egyptian Letters, which according to the Exposition of those who understand that kinde of Learning, signifie several Deities (of which the highest call'd <HI>Jynx</HI>) stands clothed in the uppermost place) whose sole power preserves the Bodies from all Accidents, and brings them to their, they suppose, Celestial Abodes.</P>
<P>Amongst the most notable Remarks in and about <HI>Cairo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Famous Sepulchres under ground.</NOTE> or within four miles, the Marble Sepulchres under ground, by which the City <HI>Memphis,</HI> and many places round about it stood, and yet stand upon Arches and Vaults, breeds most admiration, far exceeding in greatness and curiosity the Monu∣ments of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The Learned <HI>Egyptians</HI> of old,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egyptians held the <HI>Pytha∣ger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>au Metempsychosis.</HI></NOTE> which held the <HI>Pythagorean Metempsychosis,</HI> or Transmigration of the Soul from one Body to another, took care not only for their dead Corps, with great Preparation of several Spices to preserve them from corruption, but endeavor'd also by laying it in a convenient place to keep it quiet; therefore with wondrous pains and curiosity they neither disposed them in places over which the <HI>Nile</HI> flowed, nor in the open Fields, but either in long-continuing Pyramids, or Stone Caves under ground, which with great labor were cut out of entire Rocks: These Caves serv'd in stead of Church∣yards, parted into several Vaults, or arched Apartments, like great Dining-Rooms, with so many turnings out of one into another, that they seem to be a perfect Labyrinth.</P>
<P>There were, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> themselves report, so many of these, that they extended many Miles off, even as far as the Oracles of <HI>Ammon</HI> and <HI>Serapis;</HI> this was no small advantage to the Priests,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they finde out the Subterranean Sepulchres.</NOTE> therefore they hire such as are willing with Money, either to search Caves under ground within their Jurisdiction found already, or cause to be sought and digged up new, and not yet discover'd ones, in the dry and barren Sands, where, as is supposed, are many never yet found, so covered some depth under the Sands, that no stranger, no nor the inhabitants themselves, can know whether any such things lye underneath, or not: When they are discover'd, the trouble is not all over, the greater difficulties follow; for the Searchers do first make a small Well about two foot broad, and sixteen or eighteen foot deep, into which with a Rope, a servant from above is let easily down, with a Torch in his hand; true it is, in some few of them they climb up and down without Ropes, by setting their feet in certain gaps of the Wall: At the bottom of this Well they come to a four-square Passage of the same wide∣ness with the Well-mouth, but of several lengths, for in some places it is ten, in some fifteen, in some less, in some more feet long, but so low that they stoop to go in it.</P>
<P>At the end of this they come to a four-square Vaulted Repository,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Description of the E∣gyptian Vaults for Burial.</NOTE> four and twenty foot long on either side, and at the end of each stand Tables, cut out of the same Rock, about five foot long, two and a half broad, and one foot high, opposite to each other, whereupon they set their Dead in Chests or Coffins of Wood or Stone: In some Caves in the Wall above the Chests or Coffins of the Dead, are certain Hieroglyphick Characters; and there stand, besides the men∣tioned Eminent Coffins, more and other flat ones upon the Floor round about those, which seem to be Childrens; Oftentimes there lye five and twenty such Caves near one another, as in the PRINT above, wherein these Caves are re∣presented to the life; All of them come out at one Passage or Descent, and be∣cause there is no light, nor any other Entrance than the first, within it is utterly dark, so that without Torches and a Leader, it is dangerous to venture into them.</P>
<PB N="84" REF="66"/>
<P>The Ground-plat of this FOREGOING PRINT, is the fashion of the Cave, together with the Tables, whereon the Bodies shut in the Coffins are set, which here are to the number of nine, all of equal bigness; one of which is marked with the letter D. Each Cave hath on the four sides of it Marble Ta∣bles so big that the Coffin may conveniently stand thereon; these Tables, to∣gether with the four Walls of every Cave, stand in the Draught or Platform, with the numbers 1.2.3.4. as the letter X sheweth the Ground, or Floor of the Walls: All this appears cleerer in the Draught where S and T are two Vaulted Caves: Between the four Walls of the Vaulted Cave S, four Tables are to be seen, on which are four Chests, as A. O. P. K. denotes every of which has inclos'd <HI>Mummies.</HI> Commonly there are at the Head, Images set representing Children in Swadling-Clothes, with Figures of the Tutelar Gods, and at the Foot sits a Hawk; for they believe that the Body by their pre∣sence shall be freed from all violence. The second Cave T contains the like number of Tables, marked with the letters LMNB. whereupon the Em∣balmed Corps, with their Tutelar Gods by them are set: The letters Q and R shew the Ground or Floor of the other two Caves, and the letters G and H the place of the Tables. The letter G. denotes the Entrance into several other Caves, the number of which is so great, that they reach several miles, as they say: On each Wall of some Caves are seen Hieroglyphical Figures of the Guardian-Gods, which appear directly over against them, as the letters E F, and Y Z shew.</P>
<P>Now wherefore these Hieroglyphicks are Graven over against them, and not at the end, is by a hidden Mystery signified, that the inclination and kind∣ness of those Gods was the same which themselves had to the Corps: for the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believ'd that such kind of Figures had a great power and operation in them, and therefore they are set by them as Guardians to the Body: Thus we have given a Description of the Stone Caves under-ground, wherein the Egyp∣tians Buried their Embalmed Bodies, now call'd <HI>Mummies.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Mummies</HI> themselves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mummies,</HI> what they are, and the manner of their Hieroglyphical Signatures.</NOTE> two things are to be considered, first the Chests or Coffins, wherein the Bodies are lay'd, and afterwards the Body it self, onely call'd <HI>Mummy.</HI> The Body or <HI>Mummy</HI> it self, void of all Hieroglyphicks, is Embalmed with Spices and <HI>Bitumen:</HI> But the Chests or Coffins wherein the <HI>Mummies</HI> lye, and the Winding-sheets wherein they are wrapt up, be richly gilt, streaked with several Colours, and curiously depicted with Hiero∣glyphicks.</P>
<P>Every Corps lyes in a smooth or costly Chest or Coffin according to the state and ability of the person, when living, made either of Stone or Syco∣more wood, which is not subject to Worm-eating. This Coffin is gilt all over, and always hath carved on it either the likeness of some Deity, to whose Pro∣tection it was committed, or the shape of those who lay Buried therein; the Hieroglyphick Figures expressed thereon were several, and sometimes these: that is, the Image of the Deity or Person as we said before: The Figures of an Altar, an Owl, a Semi-circle, a Paper-Pedegree of the Family with an In∣scription, a Pitcher with one Ear, a Water-pot, two Pillars divided into four halfs, a Snare, a Balsam-Vessel or Urn, a Goose, an Egyptian Ship, a Branch of the Plant <HI>Papyrus,</HI> with several other Characters, which have all some peculiar signification, aiming at the preservation of the Body.</P>

<P>The whole Image represents the Goddess <HI>Isis,</HI> together with the tutelar Gods: The seven trailing Streams upon the Breast, signifie the seven Planets: By the Bodies cover'd with a Cloak or Garment like a Net, is imported that Na∣ture by hidden and hazardous adventures, makes Life a Snare, and full of en∣tangling puzzle and continual struggle: The Image of a Woman with out∣stretched Arms signifyeth the Egyptian * <HI>Jynx:</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Images within the Coffins.</NOTE> are Earthen Images, some as big as a Finger; others as a Foot; put there to defend the Bodies against evil Spirits, in several shapes of Men and Women, and other Creatures: On their Head they have commonly a Cap with Ear-lappets, on the Breast many fine Winding-Clothes: they hold the Hands across, with a Hawk in the left; they are all cloathed almost in one fashion, as the <HI>Mummies</HI> themselves; that is, bound up in Swadling-clothes after the manner of an Infant.</P>

<P>Some with much mistake, have judg'd that the life and praise of the Decea∣sed is Hieroglyphically described hereby, but the former Descriptions have sufficiently declared the contrary.</P>
<P>The antient <HI>Romans</HI> have wholly and altogether followed the <HI>Egpptians</HI> in their Funeral Solemnities,

<P>Among several which have treated of the <HI>Mummies, Athanasius Kircher</HI> in his Book of the <HI>Egyptian Hieroglyphicks; Johannes Nardius</HI> in his <HI>Exposition of Lucretius;</HI> and <HI>Peter de la Valla,</HI> deserve singular esteem: The two first for the exact descri∣ption of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> and the last for not onely describing, but also for his di∣ligent searching of them, among which he found two most remarkable; one of a Man, and the other a Woman, which he exactly describes in this manner.</P>
<Q><P>Upon a piece of a great gilded Winding-sheet that lay flat upon the <HI>Mummy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Description of the <HI>Mummy</HI> of a young Man.</NOTE> was the shape of a young Man in a long Veil of fine Linnen, as the antient <HI>Egyptians</HI> used to be cloth'd, artificially represented, and all over from head to foot delineated with Hieroglyphicks: The Head was cover'd with a Wreath of Gold and Pretious Stones, under which black-colour'd Hair appear'd; in like manner the Beard was black and curl'd, but small: On his Neck he had a Gold Chain, with a piece of Coyn like a Single-penny on his Breast, such as the Governors of Provinces in <HI>Egypt</HI> wore formerly, whereupon the Bird <HI>Ibis,</HI> with several observable Marks were pourtrayed, which seems to import that this young Man had been of quality in his time: He held in his right Hand a Gol∣den Cup with red Liquor, for a token of presenting the Drink-offering, and in his left Hand a Fruit not unlike a <HI>Malacatoon,</HI> with a Gold Ring on the fore and little finger: He had on his naked Feet black Sandals laced on: On the Girdle was a Fillet whereupon was written <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>Happy,</HI> or <HI>Happiness,</HI> perhaps the proper name of the young Man, or else set there as a Prayer for his eternal joy.</P>
<P>The Woman that lay in the same Cave,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pourtraiture of a Woman.</NOTE> was without doubt the Wife or Si∣ster of the young Man, and more sumptuously drawn upon her Herse-cloth; Besides several other Hieroglyphicks, there stood upon gilded Plates two Fowls and two Lions, back to back, and upon another Garment lay an Ox or Cow, perhaps the Image of <HI>Apis</HI> or <HI>Isis,</HI> that Idol by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> being repre∣sented in that shape. Upon another Plate hanging to the last link on the Brest, the Sun was pencil'd: In the Ears were Gems with Garters on her Arms and Legs, and many Rings on her Fingers: In her right Hand she held a Gol∣den Water-pot, and on the fore-finger of the left Hand a Ring, with other Trimmings and Ornaments: She had, as the young Man, black curl'd Hair, which cover'd her Face; dark and thick Eye-brows, with black Eyes wide open: These Effigies or Resemblances were drawn with a rough hand, like Pictures in unsetled and barbarous times.</P>
<P>In the Cave wherein the two fore-mention'd <HI>Mummies</HI> were found, there were other Corps which lay all without order, buried in the Sands, and pre∣serv'd onely by its driness. Besides the former two, there was another which
<PB N="89" REF="69"/>lay in a Woodden Coffin with a Virgin carv'd upon it, and laid forth almost like the former, with a gilt Herse-cloth and other Ornaments. In the broken Body of this Virgin, was found nothing else but a great many Rollers and <HI>Bitumen</HI> wound up therein, for the Bones and Flesh were in a manner dried and consumed, so that it seemed to be onely a shell of Wood. The Materi∣als of the <HI>Mummy</HI> were so hard, that a Hammer could scarce make any im∣pression upon it: A little forwarder other Corps were to be seen in great number, wound up in single Clothes, and preserv'd in common <HI>Bitumen,</HI> without gilt Coverings, Pourtraitures, or any other Ornaments; whence may be concluded, that the adorn'd Bodies were Persons of rank and quality, either of Priests or Great Ministers of State, which onely had hope to come to the future Dominion, as <HI>Herodotus, Diodorus,</HI> and other antient Historio∣graphers mention.</P></Q>
<P>¶ <HI>MUmmy</HI> is a <HI>Persian</HI> word,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mummy,</HI> a Persian name.</NOTE> and signifieth a dry and unperishable dead Body being Embalmed after a peculiar manner: Many are of opinion, (though not so) that the Bodies which are so call'd, were not prepared by Art, but by meer chance brought to the estate of being unperishable by this fol∣lowing means.</P>
<P>In <HI>Africa,</HI> on the east-side of <HI>Nile</HI> lyeth a great and sandy Desart, call'd from its extent, <HI>The Sandy-Sea,</HI> which by impetuous Windes is so often agita∣ted, that Travellers and Beasts with their Burthens are overwhelmed alive, and there utterly lost, which after by the power of the hot Sun and parching Sand are so dried, that they become fixed and for ever undissolvable.</P>
<P>True it is, some such Bodies are found there,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mummies</HI> are not Bo∣dies dried by the Sun in the <HI>Sea of Sand.</HI></NOTE> and sometimes sold for <HI>Mum∣mies,</HI> but they deserve not that Name, because a <HI>Mummy</HI> is onely such a Body as by a peculiar Art is incorporated and embalmed with <HI>Bitumen,</HI> and other odoriferous Spices, such as at this day in great numbers are found under the City <HI>Memphis,</HI> and the Caves about it.</P>
<P><HI>Herodotus</HI> saith in his * second Book,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot. Euterpe.</NOTE> that Bodies of Rich or Great Meh were wash'd over with <HI>Phenician</HI> Wine, and the Belly stuft with <HI>Myrrh, Cassia,</HI> and other <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> and then laid in Salt: but those of the common sort, was done with Juice or Gum of <HI>Cedar-wood:</HI> I shall briefly set down the words of this antient Writer, wherein he sheweth the whole <HI>Egyptian</HI> way of Embalming, for the better explaining of what is already said, and shall be said hereafter.</P>
<Q><P>After mourning for the Dead, they bring the Body to be embalmed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodotus.</NOTE> for which several persons are appointed excellently skilled in that Art, who when it is brought into the house, shew wooden Images of other dead persons painted in natural colours: First, the neatest, afterwards courser, and then a third the coursest of all, asking according to which they will have the Corps done: After a bargain struck, having the Corps there, the <HI>Pollinctors</HI> embalm the Body with great diligence in this manner: First, with a crooked Iron they drill the Brains out of the Head through the Nostrils, upon which they strew Medicinal Ingredients; After that with a sharp Stone had out of the <HI>Moors</HI> Countrey, they open the Belly and take out all the Bowels, which being cleansed and washed with <HI>Phenician</HI> Wine, are mixed with pounded Spices: Then they fill the Cavity of the Belly with beaten <HI>Myrrh, Cynamon, Incense,</HI> and other the like <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> and so stitch it up again; this done, they lay it seventy days in Salt, and no longer; After which the Corps are wash'd, and wound up in silk Blankets cut in slits, and spread over (like our Sear-clothes) with a
<PB N="90" REF="70"/>Gum which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> use in stead of Lime: When the Friends have recei∣ved the Corps thus Embalmed, they frame a Wooden case just fitted, where∣in they lay the Corps, and put it into the Burial-Cave next the Wall: Thus sumptuously they prepare and order their Dead.</P>
<P>There is another kind of Embalming us'd by those of the middle sort,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second sort of Em∣balming.</NOTE> being of no great cost, <HI>viz.</HI> They fill a Syringe with Gum of Cedar-wood, and inject it through the Fundament into the Belly, without removing the Bowels, then let the Corps lye so many days as aforesaid, in Salt: On the last day they squeeze out the injection by the same way, which hath such an Operation, that it brings with it what is not fit for Preservation, and the Salt consumeth the flesh; so that nothing but the Skin and Bones of the Dead remain, which finish'd, the the Corps is delivered up to the Friends, without any more cost or trouble.</P>
<P>The third way used to the poorer sort is onely this:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third sort of Em∣balming.</NOTE> they cleanse and wash the Belly first, and then lay the Corps seventy days in Salt, and so finish the <HI>Obits.</HI></P>
<P>Ladies of Quality are not so soon exposed to the Operation of Embalming, nor such as were famous for Beauty, because the Embalmers should not abuse their yet untainted Bodies: for they say, one of these
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Embalmers.</NOTE> <HI>Pollinctors</HI> used that unnatural Villany; and upon complaint of his fellow-Artists was surprized in the very Act, and suffer'd condign punishment.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Haly</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> Physitian is of opinion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haly.</NOTE> that Bodies by means of <HI>Bitumen</HI> and
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Gum of the Balsam-Tree, before mentioned. <HI>Joh. Nardius.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Opobalsamum, Myrrhe,</HI> and such like Drugs, is brought to the state of perdur∣ableness. <HI>Johannes Nardius,</HI> who caused many of the <HI>Mummies</HI> to be broken in pieces to try them, maintains strongly, that the Corps of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were Embalmed with no other Material, then
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Asfalt</HI> is a certain Rofin or Pitch, found in some Lakes, especially that of <HI>Asphaltites</HI> in <HI>Jewry,</HI> now <HI>Mare Mortuum,</HI> or <HI>the Dead Sea,</HI> at certain times cast on the Shore; but now is somewhat rare.</NOTE> <HI>Asfalt,</HI> of which all pieces of <HI>Mum∣my</HI> smell strongly.</P>
<P>In what manner the Bodies by <HI>Asfalt</HI> alone, should become uncorruptible, is much questioned: Some attribute it to the great quantity of Salt mixed therewith, but that cannot be; for Bodies lay'd in Salt, resist corruption a while,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt makes not the Corps unperishable.</NOTE> yet in length of time they consume to dust.</P>
<P>This <HI>Baronius</HI> in his History of the Church affirms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proved by <HI>Baronius.</HI></NOTE> from a Body found in the Salt Mountains of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">City of <HI>Salt.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Saltz-burgh,</HI> seeming to have a white Skin, whole and cleer, Eyes as if alive, Hair unhurt, and the rest of the Body as stiff as a stake, but when it had lyen three days in the open Air, it so consumed, that in few days it turn'd all to Water.</P>
<P>It rests then, that we say somewhat of the Manner, Art, and Means, by which Bodies Embalmed with <HI>Asfalt</HI> become so dry and hard, and how the <HI>Asfalt</HI> or <HI>Bitumen</HI> incorporates, which though at first sight it may seem difficult to apprehend, yet we shall in some measure make out as followeth.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>ASfalt</HI> hath a glutinous Body,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what manner are Bo∣dies Embalm'd with <HI>Asfalt.</HI></NOTE> being condensed by cold, and relaxing by warmth, especially Fire; but commixt with <HI>Naphta</HI> grows fluent, when both these Gums are thus dissolv'd together, they put the Corps therein, in which if they let it lye so long till it be throughly soak'd, then taking it out, and the superfluous moisture by heat drawn out of it; the work is finish'd: The probability of this is evidenced by the adequate infusing this Liquor through all parts of the Body, insomuch as the Hair of the Head, Eyes and Eye-brows in some <HI>Mummies,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vertue of <HI>Asfalt</HI> very Astringent.</NOTE> are fast conglutinated together: And the pene∣trating power of the <HI>Asfalt,</HI> which transpierceth the very Bones, and shrinks up by consolidation so wonderfully the whole Mass, that the Bodies of those so
<PB N="91" REF="70"/>Embalmed, being of full Stature, are so lessen'd by a close contraction, that they seem rather the Corps of Children, and those of Children to have been Abortives.</P>
<P>It is observable, that all the Bodies of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">At what time it was the <HI>Egyptians</HI> Embalmed their Corps, and delineaed then with hidden Letters and Learning.</NOTE> which are thus Em∣balmed, sumptuously adorn'd, and Hieroglyphically Characterized, are found either in the Stone Vaults under-ground, or in Pyramids, and were Buried therein before the Expedition of <HI>Cambyses</HI> into <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the year of the World, Three thousand four hundred and thirty; as appears by this,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observe that according to this account the <HI>Mum∣mies</HI> in the Pyramids and Vauits, are above 2000 years old.</NOTE> that the same <HI>Cambyses</HI> after his Conquest, introducing his own <HI>Persian</HI> Manners, Rites, and Customs, Banished or put to Death without mercy, the whole Priesthood of the Nation, whereby this way of interting utterly failing, was quite lay'd aside; as appears from <HI>Herodotus: These Priests,</HI> saith he,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodotus.</NOTE> <HI>onely understood those Mysteries, which might not be taught or communicated to the People in common, so that in effect the whole Science dyed with them.</HI></P>
<P>¶ IN the Caves under <HI>Memphis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continual burning Lamps or Candles found under∣ground.</NOTE> are frequently yet found a great multitude of burning Lamps made of boyled Chalk, in the shape of a Dog, a Man, a Bull, a Hawk, a Serpent, and other Beasts, wherein some with three, others with four, eight or twelve Wieks, by the report of the <HI>Arabians.</HI></P>
<P>Many have imagined from such burning Lights found, that the Antients knew this great Mysterie of so feeding fire, that it should never go out or ex∣tinguish of it self; which they strive to demonstrate by examples,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The examples of such burning Lights.</NOTE> especially two: The first, was a Taper belonging to <HI>Pallas,</HI> which in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> in the year One thousand four hundred, and one, by a Countrey Swain was found, not far from <HI>Rome</HI> by the River <HI>Tiber,</HI> together with the Body, supposed to have burnt two thousand years and up∣wards, yet could not be put out or extinguished by the Winde, nor by casting of Water, or any other moisture upon it; but as soon as by accident, the Vessel got a leak or crack at the bottom by removing, the flame instantly went out, by the running forth of its nutrimental Liquor; That this was the Body of <HI>Pallas</HI> the Son of <HI>Evander</HI> the <HI>Arcadian,</HI> kill'd by <HI>Turnus; Volateranus</HI> holds, (whose Story is at large in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Aen.</HI> Book the Tenth) upon whom he gives us this Inscription.</P>
<Q><LG>

</LG>
<P>They say this Light had continued above fifteen hundred years; the flame of this was not so perfect, as that of the other, nor so bright; perhaps the ad∣mission of Air caus'd that dimness.</P>
<P>By what Art a Light can be made to endure so long without recruit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Opinions of these long-burning Candles.</NOTE> hath been much debated; but yet remains undecided: Some deny the possibility,
<PB N="92" REF="71"/>that there are no such things in Nature, alledging that whatsoever alters or consumes in vapour, cannot be permanent, but this oily nutriment vanishes and so consumes, therefore the food of fire failing, the flame not durable ex∣tinguisheth: Such as take the opposite part, deny that all the nourishment of kindled fire must needs evaporate in a Damp, alledging that there are things that can oppose fire, by fire: Such are the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Stone, if set on fire, cannot be quench'd.</NOTE> <HI>Asbeston, Amiant,</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">We may suppose it to be <HI>Nitre.</HI></NOTE> glister∣ing stuffe like Silver in the Sand, certain Grains of <HI>Aurum Potabile,</HI> and the mentioned Lights, which by these means have burnt so long; yet 'tis a won∣der that the Defenders of these perpetually-burning Tapers, could never finde out these <HI>Asbeston</HI> Wicks, wherewith the forementioned Lamps were made.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that nothing in the world is so possible to make a perpe∣tual burning Light, as the <HI>Asbeston</HI> and <HI>Amiant,</HI> which will be very evident, if we look well into the nature of them: As to the Wick of the <HI>Amiant,</HI> little can be said of its durableness; but Father
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Linum Asbestinum</HI> is a sort of Linnen spun out of the Veins, as some suppose of the <HI>Carystian</HI> or <HI>Cyprian-Stone.</HI> Though <HI>Salmasius</HI> with more probability con∣tends the true <HI>Asbestinum</HI> to be the <HI>linum vivum</HI> of <HI>linum Indicum,</HI> in the folds of which, they enclosed the Dead Body, committing it to the fire, till it were con∣sumed to ashes: while in the same flames this Linnen shrowd, as if it had onely been wash'd, became more white and refined by the fire. <HI>Salmas. Exercitat. Plinian.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Kircher</HI> tells us, that himself had in his Lamp a Wiek of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Kircher <HI>de Lucernis</HI> Aegyptiorum.</NOTE> <HI>Asbeston,</HI> burning two years without any loss or alteration. All the difficulty to make a perpetual lighted Lamp, consists in extracting Oyl out of the <HI>Abestion,</HI> which who can do, may easily perfect the rest: Several Chy∣mists have in vain attempted and spent much fruitless time and labour about it; for the Oyl either affords no fire, more resembling water than Oyl, or else it is so thick, that it is altogether uncapable of affording flame; whereby it appears, that the mystery of extracting such an Oyl, far surpasseth humane Skill and Industry. And if any should yet say, that the two fore-mention'd examples, and (as several Authentick Writers affirm) that the manner of making such Lights, was known to the Antients, and consequently by our sublimer Wits, or <HI>Virtuosie</HI> might now be again recovered; it may be answered that the above-mention'd Lamps were not perpetual, but onely long-continuing Lights, which might na∣turally be thus effected. The Inclosed Air by continuance of time being in∣crassated by the fatness of the Bodies long pent up, may easily, as a new Coal draws Air by an <HI>Antiperistasis</HI> get a flame: So in the Winter, Water in Cisterns, by the circum-ambient Air, becomes warm: Such
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is fatuus.</NOTE> flames many times appear glimmering in Church-yards, and fat marshy grounds: The like is also assert∣ed by the Workers in Mines, that they seldom open a new Vein, but there burst out such flames, seeming of themselves consistent.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all these disputes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Egyptians</HI> had per∣petually enduring Lamps.</NOTE> that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> have had perpetual burning Lights in their Sepulchral Caves under-ground, which indeed were not made of <HI>Asbeston,</HI> but supplyed from another Fountain, appears by several <HI>Arabian,</HI> and other expert Writers, who were Eye witnesses. Their words are to this purpose.</P>

<P>The intent of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> setting these Lights near the Sepulchres, seems to signifie, that as the nature of fire is like the Operations of the Gods, so also the <HI>Numens</HI> appointed for the protection of the Corps thereby, as by a visible similitude of their own likeness, for the continual glorifying of the Soul, are drawn thither as, they believe.</P>
<P>Perhaps some will wonder,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Egyptians</HI> so carefully Bury their Corps.</NOTE> and ask for what cause the <HI>Egyptians</HI> have with such diligence taken care to preserve their Corps from perishing, and to adorn them with such exquisite Ornature: To resolve which Quaere, it is to be ob∣served first, that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> firmly believed that the first state of the world after the course of six and thirty thousand; or as others of forty thousand years, must return to its pristine state and condition again: Secondly, that accord∣ing to that Position, the Government of the Seven Superior Tutelar Guardians of <HI>Egypt</HI> at every seven thousand years end, return to the first again; so conti∣nuing for the space of

<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> then believing this, and being wonderously diligent to lead an honest and vertuous life, seem to insinuate by their Embalming of their Corps, and to desire, that those Souls after this their departure, may finde their next transmigrated habitations worthy of their deserts, till they be fully united with God; for it is certain that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> from the beginning of all Memorials have so constantly maintained the Souls Immortality,

<P><HI>Thebes,</HI> formerly a glorious City, but now almost lost in its own Ruines, lyeth West of <HI>Nilus</HI> about five days journey from <HI>Cairo. Strabo</HI> calls it <HI>Diospolis,</HI> that is,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kircher</HI> Choregraph.

Strabo</HI> gives the best and most accurate description of all other. We will give you his own words.</P>
<P><HI>Some,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo.</NOTE> saith he, <HI>reputed this City as the Metropolis of</HI> Egypt: <HI>'tis true, there still appear remaining Marks of its Greatness; being in length about eighty Furlongs.</HI> Cambyses <HI>the</HI> Persian <HI>much defac'd it and spoil'd the Temples. Now it is rather a heap of conjoyn'd Villages than a City, one part of it lying in</HI> Arabia; <HI>one of its two Colossus's cut out of an entire Stone, remaining still whole and sound, but the uppermost part of the other, is said to be broken off by an Earth-quake. They also report that sometimes a sound issues from the Pedestal. When I was there with</HI> Elius Gallus, <HI>and divers Friends and some Soldiers, I heard about the tenth hour, the like sound, but whether it was made by one of the Company, I can∣not say; because all, for the uncertainty of the Matter, had more occasion to believe so, than that such a hollow murmur should come out of such a firm body. A little further, beyond</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Memnonium,</HI> from the sounding like <HI>Memnous</HI> Tomb.</NOTE> Memnonium, <HI>are about forty Sepulchres of Kings in Caves under ground, after the manner of such as we formerly described, which are worthy the seeing. Near this Colossus are some Pyramids with Inscriptions, which set forth the Riches and Potency of those Kings.</HI></P>
<P>These words of <HI>Strabo</HI> not onely speak the Greatness, but also the Sumptuous∣ness of <HI>Thebes,</HI> and agree with the present <HI>Asuan,</HI> which is a Name given by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> by adding <HI>A</HI> to <HI>Suan</HI> or <HI>Soan;</HI> for the <HI>Copticks</HI> call'd that <HI>Soan,</HI> which the <HI>Greeks</HI> entituled <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P>In this City have been also many Pyramids or Obelisks; according to the same <HI>Strabo,</HI> as also <HI>Diodorus</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI> say here were many Pyramids, some few of which still remain, the rest by the fury of the Persians miserably defac'd and destroy'd.</P>
<P>The deep Mysteries which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> couched under their Pyramids and Hieroglyphicks sculped thereon, being a matter worth the knowledge, induce us in this place to give a more exact account of them than heretofore.</P>

<P>King <HI>Nectabanus,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Necho,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nectabanus.</NOTE> seven hundred and forty years before Christ, erected a great Obelisk at <HI>Memphis,</HI> which afterwards <HI>Ptolomeus Philadel∣phus</HI> removed to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and placed in the Temple of <HI>Arsinoe.</HI> Most of all these Obelisks at several times by the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were brought out of <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI> Lastly, the <HI>Persian</HI> King <HI>Cambyses,</HI> after the Conquest of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which happened in the Year of the World 3528. destroy'd all that remain'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">522 before Christ.</NOTE> as well those that stood upright, as those that were fallen down, and either slew or banisht all the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests, as we mention'd before.</P>
<P>These were not the Works of Kings onely, but of Priests and Ministers of State; and Custom at length prevail'd so far, that scarce a place could be seen without them; At which none ought to wonder, if he consider the <HI>Egyptians</HI> worshipt the Sun, to whose honor they erected such Spires.</P>
<P>The bigness of the Obelisks were several, some no higher than ten or twelve foot; while others did climb to the height of twenty, thirty, seventy, an hun∣dred, or a hundred and forty foot.</P>
<P>Upon every side the antient <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests carv'd Figures and Images almost in the same manner,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieroglyphick Figures carved upon the Needles or Spires.</NOTE> as those delineated upon the Covering-Clothes and Win∣ding-sheets of the <HI>Mummies,</HI> and sometimes the very same.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neeldes or Spires with∣out Figures.</NOTE> for the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests would not reveal the Mystery of their Charactering to any strangers.</P>
<P>As this Hieroglyphical manner of writing was very mysterious,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of what stone the Nee∣dles or Spires are made.</NOTE> so the Stone they chose for that purpose was most excellent, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Fire-stone.</NOTE> <HI>Pyro∣boilon;</HI> the <HI>Latines, Theban Stone;</HI> and by the <HI>Italians, Granito Rosso:</HI> It is a kinde of Marble, sprinkled and speckled as it were with Drops of several colours, and as durable and hard as <HI>Porphiry.</HI> The Quarry out of which these were cut, lyeth close by the antient City <HI>Thebes,</HI> among the Hills extending to <HI>Negro-land,</HI> and the <HI>Cataracts</HI> of <HI>Nilus</HI> to the South. And though <HI>Egypt</HI> abound in Quarries of other sorts of Marble, yet the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests chose this for the erecting of Obe∣lisks, no other Stone being us'd to that purpose; for although they had the like Veins of Marble in the Island <HI>Ilia,</HI> and other places in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> yet it could no way compare in hardness and variety of Grains and Specks, with that of <HI>Egypt.</HI> Now why the <HI>Egyptians</HI> made the Obelisks of those streak'd Marbles, this may be the reason.</P>
<P>They that erected Obelisks in honor of the Sun,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why they do so.</NOTE> whose beams their spiring tops seemed to represent, would not take every kinde of stone, but such onely as did most analogize with that glorious Body, which in their opinion this Marble doth: By nature it consisted of a four-fold Existence, <HI>viz.</HI> First, a gli∣stering Red, among which here and there are found some mixed, other clear Christal-colour'd Spots; then Violet-colour, after that Blew and Ash-colour, with some streaks or dashes of Black between; which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> seeing, they chose it, as most fit to represent their hidden Mysteries; so that by the aforesaid Mixture of the Colours, without doubt they intend to signifie the four Ele∣ments, and particularly by the Red, <HI>Fire;</HI> by the Christaline, <HI>Air;</HI> by the Blew; <HI>Water;</HI> and lastly by the Black, the <HI>Earth.</HI> Hereby appears with how great judgement the <HI>Egyptians</HI> chose fit Materials for their Mysteries, and that for the better representing their deep Notions, they have us'd nothing but what might make them more conspicuous. And if any find older Obelisks of another
<PB N="98" REF="74"/>sort, certainly they were not true <HI>Egyptick;</HI> but either erected by Strangers, in imitation of the true; or in the late times, when by the Destruction and Banishment of the Priests by <HI>Cambyses,</HI> the Sacred <HI>Egyptian</HI> Letters were utterly lost. Such was the Obelisk rais'd by the <HI>Phenicians</HI> to the Honor of the Sun; which being depressed, low, flat, and leaning, very much differ'd from the right: Such a one also <HI>Herodian</HI> says, the Emperor <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> brought from <HI>Syria</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>As to the Soil,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soil of <HI>Egypt</HI> is dry and thirsty in it self.</NOTE> it is Sandy, very Barren, and so dry and seared, that unless it lye under water many dayes, as at the overflux of <HI>Nile,</HI> it will never become fertile. Therefore the <HI>Egyptians</HI> often drown their Gardens and Orchards, so by long soaking to make them fruitful; whereby their Pot-herbs and Salletting are very waterish, and more insipid or flashy, than in <HI>Europe.</HI> But although the Soil be of it self thus steril;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is made fat by <HI>Nilus.</HI></NOTE> yet the fruitful <HI>Nilus</HI> with his fat Mud, makes it fertile, and fit for Tillage; and in some places so luxuriant, that they often mix the fatness of the Soil with Sand, to temper and allay it.</P>
<P>This onely over-flowing of the <HI>Nile,</HI> made <HI>Egypt</HI> to be esteemed not onely the Granary of <HI>Rome,</HI> but of the whole then known world; for it fed all the <HI>Roman</HI> Provinces with Corn, a third part of the year, exposing besides abundance into remoter Countreys. <HI>Pliny</HI> reports, that the ground there was so exceedingly fruitful, that one onely Seed planted in the Earth, would bring forth a hundred fold. But this wonderful fertility was attended with this in∣convenience, that the rich Product was not lasting; and from this very same cause, they dispatch'd them away to their Neighbor Nations of <HI>the Arabian De∣sart, Palestine, Syria, Constantinople,</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> especially Sugar, Cassia, Sena∣leaves, several Gums, and other Inland Commodities.</P>

The Countrey of <HI>Errif</HI> produceth excellent Rice, and other Fruits;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errif</NOTE> though towards <HI>Alexandria,</HI> some places are cover'd with Sand, and the Gar∣dens there all produce very unsound Fruit. The Lands of <HI>Becheira,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Becheira.</NOTE> lying round about the River, are extraordinarily rich; but the places between the Eastern Channel, towards <HI>Damiata</HI> and <HI>Syria</HI> are Mountainous, and without water, over-whelmed with Sand. <HI>Suez</HI> and <HI>Bocchir,</HI> and the Land about the Lake <HI>Mareotis,</HI> by <HI>Alexandria,</HI> have nothing but great sandy Desarts. <HI>Sanutus</HI> says,

<P>Among other, their groweth in <HI>Egypt</HI> a kinde of Night-shade nam'd <HI>Datura,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Datura. Alpinus de Plant. crotic.</NOTE> or <HI>Tatura,</HI> by the common people, and by <HI>Dodoneus</HI> in his <HI>Book of Plants,</HI> is call'd <HI>Strammonie,</HI> as the Fruit is by <HI>Avicenna</HI> held to be the <HI>Nut-Methel.</HI> This Plant <HI>Datura,</HI> shoots into the ground with a long, thick and brushy Root, of a very unpleasing savour. The Stalk being slender, broad, and round, grows to the height of four or five Cubits, divided into several Branches, on which hang dark brown-coloured Leaves, deeply indented on each side. The Blossom is very sweet-scented and pleasant to the eye, beneath small, above broad, and white without and within; follow'd by roundish Fruit, inclosed in a prickly Shell full of yellowish Seeds.</P>
<P>The Seeds eaten, will cast one for a time into a kind of blockish inebriation.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of it.</NOTE> It is commonly us'd among the <HI>Egyptian</HI> High-way-men, made up with bread, which dose so prepared, they have a subtle way to administer, by insinuating themselves into the Company of Merchants, following the Caravan, and under pretence of safe conduct, taking together their repast, they convey these Loaves instead of Bread, of which eating, they grow strait besotted, while they take the Plunder of their Gold, Silver, and other rich Commodities.</P>
<P>The Curtezans of the Countrey use the like Trade,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Whores in <HI>E∣gypt</HI> perform therewith.</NOTE> giving such as they in∣tend to rifle, a quarter of an Ounce of this Bread with Wine or other Drink. The same power is also ascribed to the Blossom.</P>
<P>No Plant is more known among the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> nor more used, than <HI>Colocasia;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colocasia. Alpinus de Plantis</HI> Egypt.</NOTE> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> call'd <HI>Culcas.</HI> These greatly provoke <HI>Venus,</HI> whether eaten raw or boyled; whole Fields are over-grown with these Plants; though none, whether Stranger or Inhabitant, which seems a wonder,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It Blossoms not in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> have ever seen it bear either Blossoms, Fruits or Stalks. <HI>Prosper Alpinus</HI> had a round Root (for there are of two sorts, a round, and a long) sent him out of <HI>Alexandretta;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But in <HI>Italy</HI> it doth, and the reason thereof.</NOTE> that Blossom'd in his Garden at <HI>Venice</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> in form and bigness resembling the Blossom of the <HI>Aron</HI> or <HI>Calves-foot,</HI> though with Stalks and all it is no longer than the Palm of ones Hand. Now why this Root in <HI>Egypt</HI> its own proper Countrey, should bring forth neither Blossoms nor Stalks, and in <HI>Italy</HI> usually does it, proceeds onely from the fatness of the Soil in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which makes them
<PB N="102" REF="78"/>increase onely in Leaves and Roots, whereas in <HI>Italy,</HI> being a Forrein and leaner Soil, the Roots and Foliage are small, and the upper part drawing the nourish∣ing moisture, is the cause it sometimes brings forth Stalks and Blossom.</P>
<P>Two sorts of <HI>Sebesten-Trees</HI> are found here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sebesten.</NOTE> a wilde one like the <HI>Damsin-Tree,</HI> and a Garden one, which hath thicker and broader Leaves than the wilde. The Blossom is small and white, succeeded by a Fruit, not unlike the small <HI>Damsin,</HI> with threesquare Kernels. The Fruits of the wilde <HI>Sebesten-Tree</HI> are smaller, and later ripe, than the Garden, which are bigger and better. The De∣coction is very prevalent against the Cough, Ruptures, Pluretick Stitches in the Side, Hoarseness, Agues, and all Distempers of the Breast and Lungs. The Juice of the Fruit hanging the whole year upon the Tree, and ripe in Harvest, makes excellent Birdlime; the same stamped and washed, and wrought into the form of a Plaister or Cataplasm, the <HI>Egyptians</HI> use against all hard Swellings.</P>
<P>The Tree by Physitians call'd <HI>Cassia Fistula;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pipe <HI>Cassia-Tree.</HI></NOTE> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Sagiar El Selichet,</HI> and by the <HI>Turks Chai'ar Xambar,</HI> that is, <HI>Black Cassia,</HI> flourishes in great plenty, in low and marshy places, lying near the Sea; the Stock, Bran∣ches, Leaves, and Shell, which are smooth, of a pale ashy colour, resemble the Nut-tree, but more Leavy. The Buds or Blossoms are very like the Primrose smelling well, especially early in the Morning; so that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> delight to walk under their shade. Every Blossom hath in the mid'st of it many small Strings, which at length become great, and turn thick Trunks or hollow Pipes, which ripen all the year long, and at all times continue hanging on the Tree.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> gather these Pipes at <HI>Cairo,</HI> onely in Summer time, when many other green ones appear out of the Blossom, which at length, as the first, grow dusky. That which grows in and about <HI>Damiata,</HI> hath thick Shells, but little Pelp or Juice within; but those of <HI>Cairo</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> are thinner Husked and more full, which are accounted the best, being of two sorts, that is, Reddish, which they call <HI>Abis,</HI> and are the best; the other are Black. <HI>Prosper Alpinus</HI> opinions, that the Pipes which open with shaking, are the best; but that is not so, because they are dry and withered; such as by a hard Winter and Stormy Winds, are shaken or fall from the Tree, are unfit for use. Wherefore some good Hus∣bands to prevent that, do with a string tye fast together many Pipes of the same Branch.</P>
<P>The Pelpy Juyce of the Pipes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of <HI>Cassija.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Egyptians</HI> use as we do, that is, stamped and given in Potion, mixed with Wine or other Liquor, being hot and moist in the first degree, makes a gentle Purge, driving Flegm and Choller out of the Stomach and Bowels, cleansing and allaying the heat of the Blood. The Juyce mix'd with fine Sugar, and taken inwardly, is esteemed a certain Cure of all Diseases of the Reins and Bladder: For it quenches or allays the inordi∣nate heat of the Kidneys, and an excellent Vehicle for carrying off the slimy dregs out of those Vessels through the Bladder; so that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> by the fre∣quent use thereof are absolutely freed from the Stone. It is also useful against pains in the Limbs arising from heat, especially against the Gout, applyed by way of Plaister.</P>
<P>The Blossoms Candied with Sugar, are a powerful Remedy against the Heat of the Kidneys, and cleanse and free the Uretories from vicious and slimy foulness. The green Pipes first decocted in water, and then dryed in the shade, and lay'd in Sugar or Honey, are used commonly by Women and Children against the same Distempers, taking the weight of half an Ounce at a time.</P>

The Inhabitants account them very wholsom, either eaten boyled or raw, and Physicians use them against burning Feavers, and several other like Distempers.</P>
<P>There grow also several kinds of <HI>Melons;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abdellavi.</NOTE> one call'd <HI>Abdellavi,</HI> much differing from ours: another kinde <HI>Chajar,</HI> of an unpleasant and watery taste; but the Seed is held to be more cooling,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Batechia El Mavi.</NOTE> than of the rest: A third sort, call'd <HI>Batechia El Mavi,</HI> bigger than ours, yellow of Skin, and hath within nothing but Seeds and sweet water, which they drink in great abundance, against Thirst, and to allay the heat of the Stomach, Liver, and Kidneys, and also to abate the Ter∣tian Ague. The more noble <HI>Turks, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who live delicately, drink this water onely with Sugar, and mixt with Rose-water, Musk and Am∣ber, in Summer time for their daily Drink; yet not without damage to the Stomach and Liver, because of the over-great Cooling, if it be too much us'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> keep this Fruit the whole year good, in Cellars, which as a rarity they set upon the Table for Strangers to eat.</P>
<P>Here also groweth a kind of limber Grass,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nejem El Jalib.</NOTE> creeping in the Earth with white, tartish and sweet Roots, as our <HI>Couch-grass.</HI> On the ends of the Stalks stand four Ears, with small Seeds in them, over against one another; from whence the <HI>Egyptians</HI> took occasion to name it <HI>Nejem El Jalib,</HI> that is, <HI>Cross-grass.</HI> The Seed is held for a special Remedy to dissolve the Stone in the Kidneys, and Bladder. The decoction of the Root, is with good success given inwardly against the Measles and Small Pox, and doth bring down the stopped Terms.</P>
<P>There groweth also a Tree call'd <HI>Atle,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tamaris-Tree,</HI> or <HI>Atle.</HI></NOTE> very like the <HI>Tamaris-Tree,</HI> which <HI>Dioscorides</HI> names <HI>Mirica</HI> and <HI>Tamerix,</HI> and is found in several places of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> though no where in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<PB N="105" REF="79"/>
<P>The <HI>Egyptian Atle,</HI> shoots up to the bigness of a great <HI>Olive-Tree,</HI> and in the Countrey of <HI>Sahid,</HI> grows as big as a great Oak. The Leaves are like those of the <HI>Tamaris,</HI> but longer, smaller, and full of green Hairs. The Fruit, is hard, woody, or sticky, without Kernels, and seems to be the same with <HI>Nut-Galls.</HI></P>
<P>The Wood of it they use for Fuel for want of other;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of it.</NOTE> and also make thereof a kind of Charcoals, which all <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> burn.</P>
<P>The Leaves open Obstructions of the Milt or Spleen; so do Cups, Cans, and Pots, made of the Wood.</P>
<P>In several places of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and especially about <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dadel-Tree,</HI> unknown to us.</NOTE> are great Woods of <HI>Dadel-Trees,</HI> which the <HI>Arabians</HI> from the name of the Fruit call <HI>Dachel.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dadel-Tree</HI> (of which there are Male and Female) hath every other year abundance of Fruit, but the Female affords no Fruit, unless her Branches be plash'd with those of her Mate. Many to make the Female fruitful,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alpinut.</NOTE> strow the Matter that lyes in the Bag or Receptacle, out of which the Blossom and Fruit comes, upon her Branches: And probably if the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did not so, they would bring bring forth no Fruit, or if they did, they would never come to any perfection. But <HI>Veslingus</HI> seems to reject this,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observat. in Alpin.</NOTE> ascribing the great fruitfulness of it to the Soil, being Sandy and Nitrous: For he affirms that he hath seen the Earth in the <HI>Dadel-Tree</HI> Wood oftentimes, thick cover'd with a white Down or Callow, like Cellar Walls where we finde our Saltpetre, which by the sultry South windes from <HI>Negro-land</HI> and the Barren <HI>Arabia,</HI> is in great abundance driven up hither, and falling on the tops of the <HI>Dadel-Trees,</HI> not onely makes them flourish, but also pregnant.</P>
<P>The Roots are so small, thin and short, that it is a wonder how it supports it self, being so great, especially when so often charged by strong &amp; assiduous gusts; for contrary to other Trees, this tapers downwards, and the slenderest part of the Stock is nearest the Foot, which hath made some suppose that the Plant, though large, receives no nourishment from the Earth by the Root, but from the Air.</P>
<P>There is no Tree more profitable, or turns to a greater account than this: for of the Stock or Body they make Beams and Rafters for Floorings of Houses, and of the Boughs and Branches they make divers sorts of Wooden Ware, which they call <HI>Cuffaz.</HI> Of the Leaves, Sayls and Mantles; and of the Bark they make Tow and Cordage for Ships. The Fruit affords not onely a most delicious Food, but good Physick. The <HI>Arabians</HI> as we said, call this Tree <HI>Dachel;</HI> a Bough of it with <HI>Dadels</HI> on, they call <HI>Samarrhich;</HI> the Bag or Cod, <HI>Dux;</HI> a young un∣ripe <HI>Dadel, Tella;</HI> a greater, <HI>Nin;</HI> one half ripe, <HI>Ramich;</HI> perfectly through ripe, <HI>Bellan;</HI> a dryed one, <HI>Tamar;</HI> a rotten one, <HI>Rotob;</HI> and the Leaves, <HI>Zaaf.</HI> In the Stock where the Branches shoot out, lyes a white Bag full of Pelp or Juice; which many, when a Tree either falls or is cut down, pull out, and eat raw, as a provocative to <HI>Venus;</HI> it not differing much in taste from our <HI>Arti∣choaks.</HI></P>
<P>There also you may see in some Orchards a Tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotton-Tree.</NOTE> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> call'd <HI>Gottne'l Ssegiar,</HI> whereon the Cotton groweth. It rises ten Cubits high; the Wood hard; the Leaves have five deep indentings; the Fruit is a Nut as big as an Apple, cover'd with a green Skin, full of Milk, white Wool or Cot∣ton, which by the opening of the Fruit as it ripens, endeavors to thrust it self out; within which, is one onely dark brown hidden Seed.</P>
<P>There is
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lasting but a year.</NOTE> an Anniversary Plant that also bears Cotton, and differs from the afore-mention'd in slenderness of Stock, and form of Branches and Leaves;
<PB N="106" REF="80"/>this grows not in <HI>Egypt,</HI> but plentifully in <HI>Candy, Cyprus, Apulia,</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> which from thence the <HI>Egyptians</HI> transport, for they use not their own Cotton, being but scarce, but the other in all cases, and particularly in stead of Lint for Wounds, as also to stench Bleeding. The Juice or Extract of the Seed is very Sovereign in all Agues and Burning Feavers, and good to expel what ever cor∣rodes and gripes the Stomach and Bowels.</P>
<P>There is also another Tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carneb,</HI> or <HI>St. Johus Bread.</HI></NOTE> bearing Fruit Semi-circled like a Hunters Horn, call'd here <HI>Saint Johns Bread;</HI> by the <HI>Arabians, Carob</HI> or <HI>Carneb,</HI> that is, <HI>The Mother Horn,</HI> with whom the Fruit onely is in use, out of which they draw an exceed∣ing sweet Honey, wherewith in stead of Sugar they preserve the <HI>Cassia Fistula, Tamarine Ginger,</HI> and other Fruits green. Moreover, that Honey is very much us'd by them in Clisters, by reason of its solubility.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sant,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sants</HI> or <HI>Acatia.</HI></NOTE> the true <HI>Acatia</HI> of the Antients, groweth in <HI>Egypt</HI> in a Tract of Land far from Sea, by Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI> The Body of the Tree hath a Bark black, rough, and prickly. The Leaves are small and slender, closing at the setting, and opening again with the rising Sun. The Fruit lyes in a flattish Cod or Husk, like those of a Lilly, of a Thumb breadth, and sometimes a span long. From the green Cods stamped in a Stone-Mortar,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juice of <HI>Acatia.</HI></NOTE> they extract a Juice, by decocting made thick and hard;

<P>This <HI>Egyptian</HI> Plant sends forth also from the Body a Gum,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gum-Arabick.</NOTE> by the Apothe∣caries call'd <HI>Gum-Arabick,</HI> though others think that their Gum proceeds not only from this, but is a Compound-product of many other; because in <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> no sorts of Summer Trees are to be found, but this <HI>Sant</HI> onely.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mauz,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mauz,</HI> or <HI>Muza.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Muza,</HI> by which name also the Fruit is known, groweth in several places of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and especially about <HI>Damiata;</HI> but in much greater abundance in <HI>Guinee</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> where we shall speak more fully of it.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> produces also several sorts of fair and beautiful Flowers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the flowers in <HI>Egypt</HI> lose their smell.</NOTE> as <HI>Hyacinthus, Daffadil,</HI> and the like, brought over from <HI>Constantinople</HI> by the Turkish Bashaw's, but keep not long any esteem, because here their fragrancy is presently lost.</P>
<P>In <HI>Egypt</HI> are no <HI>Poplars,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belon.</NOTE> but <HI>Myrtles</HI> in abundance. Here is also a sort of <HI>Rue</HI> call'd <HI>Hermale,</HI> wherewith the <HI>Arabians, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> perfume them∣selves every morning, with perswasion that the scent thereof drives away evil Spirits.</P>
<P>Here also grow very great <HI>Pomegranats,</HI>

<P>Among all the rich Commodities of this Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Egypt</HI> is no Wine pro∣duced.</NOTE> there is no Wine but what Merchants import from other places: the flatness of the Region hinder∣ing the Planting and Dressing of Vineyards;

<P>As to Gardens and Husbandry, there are few of the one,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Tilage is done in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> and little of the other here, but abundance of Wheat and other Grain, being sowed upon the bare Mud which <HI>Nilus</HI> at his Overflux left upon the Land, without other la∣bor of Ploughing or Tilling, than the running it over with a wooden Harrow, the better to drive and settle the Seed therein.</P>
<P>This shall suffice to have spoken concerning Plants or Vegetables, we shall now proceed to enumerate Quadrupedes, Fowls, and Fish, wherein it hardly gives place to any other Region in the world.</P>
<P>¶ FOur-footed Beasts, by reason of the great plenty of Grass, Meadows, and Pastures, excellent Trees and shady Groves, bred up and nursed by the <HI>Nile,</HI> are here for the most part very large, as Bees, Oxen, Camels, Horses, Asses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellon.</HI> lib. 2. cap. 25.</NOTE> Goats, and Sheep; which last are fat and fleshy, with a Dew-lap like Oxen, and long spreading Tayls, that hang upon the ground. The Mutton, Veal, Beef, and Lamb, is singularly sweet and delicious, but somewhat moist and watry.</P>
<P>The Goats very numerous about <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goats with long Ears.</NOTE> have Ears hanging down to the ground, and at the end four or five fingers broad, curling upwards.</P>
<P>There is another kinde of these that are wilde,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilde Goats.</NOTE> by the present Natives call'd <HI>Gazelles,</HI> but known to the antient <HI>Greeks</HI> by the name of <HI>Orygis,</HI> commonly run∣ning in great Herds in the Fields and Woods, which the Inhabitants shoot or kill with Guns. Their Hair and Tayls, Eyes and Eye-brows, resemble Camels; fore-footed like a Hare, shorter before than behinde. They have a black Horn, and bleat like tame Goats, but are Beardless; very nimble in climbing, but unweildy to descend; on plain ground very swift. The Horns of the Male exceed those of the Female, standing very straight, onely at the end a little crooked. <HI>Pliny</HI> says they have but one Horn, and which is more remarkable, if true, when the Dog-star ariseth, they look stedfastly upon it, performing some gestures, as it were, of Adoration to it.</P>
<P>Here also are a kinde of Apes, the Baboon, call'd in Greek <HI>Cynocephalus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cynocephalus.</HI> The Drill, or Baboon. <HI>Arist.</HI> lib, 2. cap. 7. Hist. Animal.</NOTE> that is, <HI>Dogs-head,</HI> for the likeness of that part to a Dog: They are much larger, stronger, and wilder than the other, with Teeth sharp and set close together: This Beast, according to the testimony of <HI>Horus,</HI> had a very extraordinary pro∣perty, which was to urine every hour. For these and other rarities observ'd by the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests in this Creature, it was of frequent use among the Hiero∣glyphicks, to denote and signifie several Mysteries.</P>
<P><HI>Chameleon</HI> is a Greek word, and signifies <HI>A Little Lion:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chameleon.</NOTE> Bellonius</HI> says they fre∣quent about <HI>Cairo,</HI> and many other places in the Hedges and Bushes: it bears some little resemblance of the <HI>Crocodile,</HI> from which different in Colour, Head,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their shape.</NOTE> Tongue, Eyes and Feet: It creeps not, but walks upon all four, the Head long and sharp like a Hog; the Neck very short; and Eyes, which having no Eye-lid, can turn about on every side.</P>
<P>This is a sluggish and dull Animal, holding the Head carelesly, and the Mouth always gaping, lolling out the Tongue, and so catching Flies, Grashoppers, Caterpillars, Palmer-worms, and such like; in stead of Teeth having one en∣tire Jaw-bone, indented like a Saw, but useless, swallowing whole what ever Food it takes, wanting both Spleen and Bladder, dunging, or rather muting like a
<PB N="108" REF="81"/>Hawk. The Back hath a hard and rough Skin, beset with some few prickles: the two fore Feet, <HI>Bellonius</HI> saith, have three Claws inwards, and two out∣wards; but the hinder Feet three outwards, and two inwards, with hooked Nails or Talons.</P>
<P>It hath a strange and ridiculous manner of gate or movement,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its gate is ridiculous.</NOTE> for stretch∣ing both feet on each side at once together, and so alternately, the other makes such a shuffling gradation, one Shoulder jetting foremost, the other out-step∣ping that, with a continual untoward hank and loose, that it makes Spectators laugh, as if it were a match, which side should come first to the Goal. But he is so nimble in running up Trees, that he seems rather to flie; wherein he makes great use of his Tail to lay hold on the Boughs, especially in coming down; whence we may gather, that the <HI>Camelion</HI> more frequents trees, than the ground.</P>
<P>Nor give the motions of the Eyes less cause of Comical admiration,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It stirs the Eyes wonder∣fully.</NOTE> for he does not as other Creatures, who turn both Eyes at once after the same object: But somtime like our squinters, not only look two opposite ways at once, but more, seeing right forward with one Eye, and looking up with the other aloft; ano∣ther while to the ground with one, and sideling with the other; but which is yet stranger, it will draw one Eye to its Back, and make a survey behind, while the other takes a prospect forwards.</P>
<P>They make at their Meals also Merriment,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It Eats devouring, or swallowing whole.</NOTE> neither pecking as Fowl, nor chawing like Cattel, nor sucking like Lampreys and leeches; but with an odd and sudden flutter of the Tongue, shot out near a hands breadth, ingurges the caught prey in a trice.</P>
<P>This member being nothing else but a hollow Pipe,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fashion of the Tongue.</NOTE> fleshy and spongy, wherein are some Sinews easier to shut together than a Gin or Trap, because those Nerves proceeding from the <HI>Os Hyoides,</HI> and running through the Cavity, draws the same after expansion back again, with its prey sticking to a glutinous stuff, wherewith it is covered: This refutes the opinions of the Antients, who believed the <HI>Camelion</HI> liv'd by the Air, whereas in truth, it lives by such receiv'd nourishment as we have declared.</P>
<P>It appropriates to it self another peculiar quality in the Opinion of some old Writers, who deliver that the <HI>Camelion</HI> changes colour according to the several objects presented: First in the Eyes, then in the Tail, after that in the whole Body.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cameleons</HI> vary not co∣lour with their objects.</NOTE> And this alteration of colours, many Authors conjecture, and among others, the Roman <HI>Panarolus</HI> affirms to proceed from the <HI>Systole</HI> and <HI>Dia∣stole</HI> of the Heart, which according to sensibility of heat or cold, beats quicker or slower, the quicker striking a redness, whereas the slow reduces him to his own natural Ash-colour; for it retains that hew even after Death, though a little paler.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ichneumon</HI> of old call'd by the Greeks <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ichneumon.</NOTE> a Hog, from rooting in the Earth; but now by <HI>Bellonius</HI> nam'd <HI>The Egyptian,</HI> and by <HI>Elianus, The Indian Rat,</HI> though some will have it, <HI>The Egyptian Otter:</HI> it much resembles a Cat, but longer, and of a rougher hair, colour'd between bay and dun, round Ears, black Legs, and a long stern taporing from the Hanch to the end. Near the Fundament appears another wide passage hairy all over, which hath given Wri∣ters occasion to suppose that this Beast was a Hermaphroditick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ichneumon,</HI> bred onely in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and chiefly about <HI>Alexandria,</HI> becomes tame as Cats and Dogs; <HI>Vitruvius</HI> asserts, they are also found on one side of Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> and at the Head-Springs of <HI>Nile.</HI> They feed on Mice, Snakes, Snails, Cameleons, Frogs, and small Fowl, especially Hens. Some fancies
<PB N="109" REF="81"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> that it hath a peculiar appetite to the Liver of a Crocodile, and therefore creeps into its Belly sleeping; but in truth not so much to eat the Liver, as from a natural antipathy; for it also breaks their Eggs wherever found, to the no small advantage of the people, who greatly rejoyce at their destruction. It cannot endure the winde: for whensoever they rise it sculks under shelter. This creature though multiparous, having always many young ones, hunts eagerly Mice and Snakes, as a Poulcat or Weesel, therefore they are kept tame, and preserve themselves against cold by playing and motion: It thrusts her Head between her hinder Legs, so converting into a round bundle, like a Hedge-hog or Porcupine.</P>
<P>At the approach of any Beast, it bunches the Back, and bristles up the Hair as in defiance, daring to set upon Mastiff Dogs, nay upon Horses or Camels, and will leave a Cat breathless at three strokes; he seizeth his prey cou∣ching like a Bull-Dog upon the ground, and at length rising upon the hinder legs falls upon it with a leap. When he draws to Battel against the <HI>Asps,</HI> he rolls first in the Mud, then dryes himself in the Sun, or else dips over head in water, and then tumbles to gather up the dust, which she uses as defensive Arms against the Enemy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scincos,</HI> which <HI>Dioscorides</HI> suppos'd to be the Land-Crocodile,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scincos.</NOTE> and <HI>Bello∣nius</HI> the small Crocodile, in outward appearance one and the same, having four feet, and as big, sayes <HI>Bellonius,</HI> as the <HI>Salamander,</HI> with a round knotty Tail. <HI>Renodeus</HI> appropriates to it many small and yellow knobs, a long Head, and a round Tail, somewhat crooked at the end, with a blew list or streak from the point of the stern to the crown of his Head. They feed upon sweet smelling Flowers, and bury their Eggs, whose flesh they use Physically, as Cantharides to heighten <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>The Bird <HI>Ibis,</HI> hath long Legs and a crooked Beak, being of two sorts, <HI>viz.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bird <HI>Ibis.</HI></NOTE> the white found all over <HI>Egypt;</HI> and the black onely to be had at <HI>Damiata,</HI> and no where else. The white ones have a head like a Sea-pie, and a pointed and hooked red Beak, about a Thumbs breadth. It represents the form of a mans
<PB N="110" REF="82"/>Heart, when hiding the Head and Neck in the Feathers under its Breast. <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI> says, it weighs but half an Ounce when first hatched. <HI>Gaudentius Merula,</HI> gives it a Heart too big, if compar'd with the Body. <HI>Elianus</HI> avers, that his Guts are ninety and six Cubits long, which are shrunk together, so long as the Moon is near the Change unseen. This Bird with which all the ways to <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> are filled, is so peculiar to <HI>Egypt,</HI> that it will starve it self to death if tran∣sported thence. Yet some say, the like is found about <HI>Licha,</HI> in the utmost parts of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>They eat Serpents, Grashoppers, and such like: A West-winde drives them out of the <HI>Lybian Desarts</HI> into these parts, where they are very numerous and much nourished, because of their enmity to Serpents. And for this reason, they say,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Josephus.</NOTE> that when <HI>Moses</HI> drew into the Field against the <HI>Moors,</HI> through places beset with Serpents, he took these Birds along with him, shut up in Paper Cages. For fear of the Cats, they make their Nests upon high Palm-trees. Some hold, but with what reason is yet controverted, that a Basilisk or Cockatrice is bred out of the Eye of this Bird <HI>Ibis:</HI> But most certain, says <HI>Elian,</HI> that the Feathers and Eggs stupifying, take away all motion from the Crocodile; it makes it self clean when preparing to sleep. This Creature first taught the use of Clisters and Syringes; for with the crooked Bill, as with a Syringe, it injects Salt-water into his own Bowels, to open its vent when obstructed: and from thence, says the same <HI>Elian, Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> the <HI>Egyptians</HI> took that Chyrurgical Practice. Another observable thing, and peculiar to this Bird is, that it will drink no foul or unwholesom water: wherefore the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests made Holy-water of such as the <HI>Ibis</HI> had drunk.</P>
<P><HI>Bellonius</HI> says,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sacred Hawk.</NOTE> here is a Sacred Hawk, because formerly worshipp'd by all the people, large as a great Raven, headed like a Kite, but of the usual colour of Hawks. 'Tis a Bird of Prey, abounding not onely here, but in <HI>Syria,</HI> though ve∣ry seldom, and sometimes also in <HI>Caramia.</HI> It had so much repute, as to give the name <HI>Baieth</HI> to one of the Provinces of the Countrey, as the <HI>Crocodile</HI> did to <HI>Cro∣codilopites;</HI> the Dog, to <HI>Cynopolites,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>The Priests comprehended great Mysteries under this Bird,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It signifies great Mysteries among the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></NOTE> and their Figure was carv'd upon almost all their Spires or Obelisks, where always uppermost was the Deity of the Sun, acknowledged to be full of Spirit, Light, and Life; <HI>For this,</HI> saith <HI>Horus, the</HI> Egyptians <HI>call'd them</HI> Baieth, <HI>and</HI> Thaustus; Bai <HI>signi∣fying the Life; and</HI> Eth, <HI>an Heart: because as the Heart is the Fountain of Life, so the Sun is the Heart, or Soul of the World; for this reason the</HI> Egyptian <HI>Priests did conceit that the Hawk,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Egyptian Hawk, or rather the Eagle, drinks no water.</NOTE> because of the similitude of Nature which it hath with the Soul, drinketh no water, but blood, whereby they imagine the Soul to be nourish'd. In their Hieroglyphical Writings a Hawk represented God, partly because above all other Fowl it seems to be the Image of the Sun, being observ'd out of a peculiar and hidden power of Nature, to look with very fixed Eyes upon its Beams, and for that cause they sometime pourtray the Sun in the form of a Hawk.</HI> Those who had willingly or unwillingly kill'd a <HI>Hawk,</HI> or the Bird <HI>Ibis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot.</NOTE> were without hope of pardon condemn'd to die: Nay, so high was their Veneration of it, that they ceremoniously buried a dead <HI>Hawk,</HI> and brought it to the City <HI>Bulis.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been observ'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Egyptians have taken several Letters from the forms of Beasts.</NOTE> that the antient <HI>Egyptians</HI> took several of their Letters from the forms of the Legs, Head, and Beak of the Bird <HI>Ibis,</HI> and this sacred <HI>Hawk;</HI> as also from the <HI>Ox,</HI> and the <HI>Dog,</HI> both by them reputed religious. These four Beasts were of the highest esteem, not only for their use in Hieroglyphical Writing, but also because in their High-times of Solemnity, call'd <HI>Comasien,</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="82"/>they usually carried them in Procession, according to the Testimony of <HI>Cle∣mens Alexandrinus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Herodotus</HI> writes, That in former times about <HI>Thebes,</HI> small bodied Serpents with two horns on the crown of their Heads, and very harmless, were found; which being dead, they buried in the Temple of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> because they believed them dedicated to him. The same <HI>Herodotus</HI> reports, but from hear-say, That near the City <HI>Brutus,</HI> close by <HI>Arabia,</HI> were Serpents with wings, which flew thence in the beginning of Lent into <HI>Egypt;</HI> but the Bird <HI>Ibis</HI> met and fell up∣on them in their flight, and by their deaths anticipated any prejudice from their arrival: for which benefit the <HI>Ibis</HI> was held in great adoration.</P>
<P>As the Land is ennobled by producing great store of Plants, Beasts and Fowls, so the <HI>Nile</HI> hideth in its bosom a vaste abundance of Fishes; of which the Crocodile, and <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> or Sea-horse, which are <HI>Amphibii,</HI> be the most noted and chief. And though the Crocodile keeps in several Rivers of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> as in the River <HI>Ganges</HI> about <HI>Bengala,</HI> and in the <HI>Niger</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> yet <HI>Nilus</HI> feedeth the greatest, as though a more peculiar of that than any other Rivers.</P>
<P>The Crocodile <HI>Herodotus</HI> tells us,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crocodile.</NOTE> the antient <HI>Egyptians</HI> about <HI>Elephantina</HI> call <HI>Champsa,</HI> and in the Dominion of <HI>Syena,</HI> according to <HI>Strabo, Suchus;</HI> but the <HI>Ionians</HI> or <HI>Greeks,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, Crocodiles.

<P>This wonderful Creature has very great Eyes with little balls or apples,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Form.</NOTE> whose Back-bone consists of sixty Joynts; his Feet furnish'd with sharp nails, and splaying outwards, and the Tail proportionable to the Body, lessening by degrees to the end. This Serpent, as we may call it, runs swiftly, but can nei∣ther deviate to the right or left, or turn about easily, but with a stiff formali∣ty goes directly forward by reason of the inflexible Joynts of the Back-bone, by which means it is often avoided. They say, it can live four whole Moneths without food, but when hungry will cry or weep like a man. Some dare affirm, though untruly, that it lives of Mud or Slime; for it eats dead fish, and humane flesh: <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> relates in his <HI>Babylonish Embassy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter Martyr.</NOTE> that one of them was taken that had three young Children in his Mouth. When they ingender, the Male turns the Females Belly upward,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Breeding of them.</NOTE> otherwise for the shortness of their Feet they cannot well couple: After that Coition, the Fe∣male lays sixty Eggs, each as big as a Goose Egg, upon which they sit to hatch sixty days. Some conceit that they bury their Eggs in the Sand, and hatch their young ones by the heat of the Sun, but that is not so: however there is no Creature that from so small a beginning, comes to such an extraordinary bigness, some being found to exceed thirty Foot in Length.</P>
<P>They bear enmity to the <HI>Ichneumon, Buffel, Tyger, Hawk, Hog-fish, Dolphin,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lee. Afric.</NOTE> Others suppose this little Bird picketh out the Worms breeding between the Teeth, who ingratefully would eat it up for requital, but that the sharp Pin on the Birds Head pricking his Jaws, makes him open them, by which means the Bird escapes.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form of it.</NOTE> Master-Surgeon of <HI>Narn.</HI> It hath no likeness of a Horse, the Body resembling an Ox, and the Legs a Bear: From Head to Tail thirteen Foot long, and four and a half broad; The Belly was rather flat than round; The Compass of his Legs was a Yard, and his Foot twelve Inches in breadth; Each Claw had three Divisions: The Head two Foot and a half broad, three Foot long, and seven Foot about: The whole of a very large Size: The Mouth is fleshy, shrivel'd, and very wide; The Eyes an Inch broad, and twice as long; The Ears little, and but three Fingers long: It was fat, had Claws divided into three, with a Tail like a Hog: The Nostrils large: The
<PB N="113" REF="83"/>lips like a Lions, beset with a bristly Beard, though the rest of the Body were without Hair. In the nether Jaw were six Teeth, of which the two outermost were half a Foot long, two Fingers broad, and on either Side seven thick, and short Grinders. In the upper Jaw, which he moved like the Crocodile, were the like; all of them as hard as Flints, and from thence for an Experiment, by striking the back of a Knife upon it, flew sparks of Fire, so that it is probable, that this Beast with gnashing his Teeth one against another, might seem to breath Fire; which special property the Antients ascribed to it, but thus mistaken. He will leap ashore, and running into the Plow'd Lands, satiate himself with Corn; then immediately returning into the River, either for fear of Hunters or Plowmen way-laying him. When superfluous fatness troubles Him, he rubs himself so long upon the stump of a Reed, till he hath opened a Vein; which having bled enough he closeth, plaistring it over with Mud.</P>

<PB N="115" REF="84"/>
<P>¶ THe Air, especially about <HI>Cairo,</HI> and further towards the South,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Hot.</NOTE> because so near the Line, is when the Sun casts his Beams perpendicularly from <HI>Cancer,</HI> very Hot; during which time of violent Heat, all the people dwell in places under ground; and in <HI>Cairo,</HI> in the midst of every House, are Wells containing water, which not only cools their Mansions, but refreshes them∣selves. They contrive also in their Houses very great Pipes or Funnels, which stand right up into the Air, from the midst of the House, with a broad Mouth like a Bell, standing open to the North, wherein the cool Air en∣tring, is sent down to the lowermost retiring Rooms under Ground. For shade also in the Streets, every Dwelling hath a broad Penthouse: And for refreshment of their scorched Bodies they use bathing, for the commodious∣ness whereof they have curious Bannia's of sweet and clear Water from the River <HI>Nile,</HI> without mixing any Herbs or Medicinal Ingredients.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hot Air is cooled by <HI>Nilus,</HI> and the Anniversary Winds.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Heat also is somewhat moderated by the overflowing of <HI>Nilus</HI> at that Time, and the continual blowing of cool Northerly Winds; otherwise the Heat there is so vehement, that neither Man nor Beast could be able to live. In Winter, the Air is Hot and Dry, sometimes a little cool, but generally very Hot, and most obnoxious to the Head of all parts of the Body. The Air of the Nights is cold, which after Sun-rising becomes a little Warm; at Noon very Hot, but at Night again Cold: so that its inequality breeds many Diseases.</P>
<P>¶ THe Year may also very well, though in a different way from us,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Seasons of the Year are with the <HI>Egyptians</HI> fourfold.</NOTE> be di∣vided into four Seasons, The first is Spring,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> or <HI>April.</HI></NOTE> in which the Weather is temperate. They have also every Year two Summers, but contingent, divi∣ded into an unhealthy and intemperate, and a healthy and temperate.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Summer.</NOTE> The first being the unhealthful, continues to the middle of <HI>June,</HI> and the rising of the <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>The second Summer begins from the <HI>Nile</HI>'s rising,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Summer.</NOTE> and continues till <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> and the Decrease. The Harvest consists of two other Moneths;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harvest.</NOTE> but the Brumall Season beginneth on <HI>December,</HI> and continueth to <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Winter.</NOTE> Thus is the Year divided, the Reason whereof we will a little search after. First, Then they placed the Spring, as before is said, because at that Time the Air is of a moderate and milde Temper, and the Trees begin to bud and grow,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Summer causeth many Diseases.</NOTE> and the Ground to bring forth. The Spring ended, the first Summer begins, very hurtful both to Man and Beast; during the whole time of whose conti∣nuance, very hot and tedious Winds blow, call'd by them <HI>Campsien,</HI> from <HI>Campsi</HI> a Commander, who was overwhelm'd under a great heap of Sand by these Winds, and smother'd with his whole Army in the Desarts of <HI>Africa:</HI> Such is the violence of these impetuous Gusts, sometimes, that it so raises the Sand, that for three, five, seven, or nine Days, the Air is darkn'd, and the Sun can∣not be seen for those Atomy Clouds. At this time rage many mortal Sick∣nesses, but chiefly Soreness of the Eyes, for the hot South-winds, as we said,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this comes to pass.</NOTE> so drive up the scortching Sand, that they seem to bring with them shining Flames, the which driven through the Air, hurts and prejudiceth the Body, and in the Eyes breeds prickings and inflamations. And that time many mortal Feavers and Phrensies rage, which dispatch men in few Hours. In fine, all Bodies are thereby so Distempered, that they abhor Food, continually burning with unquenchable Thirst, against which the Water of <HI>Nile</HI> is the only Remedy.
<PB N="116" REF="85"/>Strangers all this Season retire to places under Ground, where they remain till other cool North-winds arise from the <HI>Midland-Sea,</HI> which afford a present Comfort to their inflamed and afflicted Bodies, wonderfully cooling the Air.</P>
<P>After this followeth the second Summer, not so Hot, because the Northerly Winds daily renew fresh and cooling Breezes, and the <HI>Nile</HI> over∣flows his Banks: What Alterations of Air happen, are not sudden, but come leisurely, and therefore it is a healthful and wholesome Time.</P>
<P>Now the Husbandmen live at Ease, because the Ground, while covered with the <HI>Nile,</HI> cannot be either Plowed or Tilled, passing the Time in Shows, Sports, and other signs of Joy, with Feastings and Mirth. Then comes Seed∣time and Harvest at the Decrease of the <HI>Nile,</HI> in which are Wheat and other Fruits sown, which becomes soon Ripe, and are suddenly Reaped. This Sea∣son is temperate and free from Sicknesses: The following Winter-Moneths the Air is colder, and consequently more wholesom.</P>
<P>It Rains seldom in the In-land Parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It Rains seldom in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> and about <HI>Cairo,</HI> and what is, is rather a Dew or misling than a Shower. At <HI>Alexandria</HI> and <HI>Damiata,</HI> and upon all Places lying near the Sea, are many times great Rains, but seldom or never is there any Ice, Snow, or Hail seen, because the Air is not cold enough for it. This as to the Temperature of the Air.</P>
<P>¶ NOw concerning the Temper and Constitution of the People,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several kinds of <HI>Egypti∣ans.</HI></NOTE> you may observe three sorts of Inhabitants in <HI>Egypt, viz.</HI> Citizens, dwelling in <HI>Cairo</HI> and other Cities; wandring <HI>Arabians,</HI> that live in Tents; and lastly, Ploughmen or Husbandmen, which dwell up the Countrey. Most of the Ci∣tizens are Sanguine, but the Bodies of the Ploughmen and <HI>Arabians</HI> are hot and dry, so are many Townsmen; but the continual drinking the <HI>Nile</HI> Water, often use of cooling Food or Diet, and the immoderate use of <HI>Venus,</HI> mightily lessen and alter the Heat and Drought. Besides, their continual use of Baths of sweet Water, so cools them, that many of those dry tan'd Complexions be∣come Sanguine, especially Women and Eunuchs. They have cold Stomachs, and full of Flegm, proceeding from the constant using of cooling Diet, as also by the over-great Heat of the Air, whereby the natural Heat extracted or ex∣haled, the Stomach is left Raw and Cold.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> are general very Gross and Corpulent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The form of their Bo∣dies.</NOTE> especially the People of <HI>Cairo;</HI> most of the Men there being so Fat, that they have much Greater, Thicker and Larger Breasts than Women; but the <HI>Arabians</HI> are Meagre and Slender, so are the Husbandmen, and not only so, but also hairy, sweaty, and almost scorched and burnt by the Sun. They do all follow <HI>Venus</HI> immoderate∣ly; they are by Nature very Wakeful, and little inclining to Sleep, of a chear∣ful Spirit, yet delighting in an Idle and Lazy Life; only the <HI>Arabians</HI> and Farmers take Pains, or else they must Starve.</P>
<P>¶ THis Countrey is very subject to several and dangerous Diseases,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Egypt</HI> is much subject to Land-Sicknesses.</NOTE> partly because of the intemperate Air, partly by the immoderate use of Wo∣men, and partly because the Poor there which are numerous, are necessitated to use foul unwholesom Food, and muddy and corrupt Water. The chief Diseases afflicting them, are Blear Eyes, Scabs, Leprosie, and Mortal Phren∣sies, Small Pox, pain in the Limbs and Joints, Ruptures, Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder, Consumption, Obstructions or Stoppings, Weaknesses of the Liver, Spleen, and Stomach, Tertian Agues, Consuming Quartanes, and all
<PB N="117" REF="85"/>manner of Maladies of the Head. It is true, other people are subject to the like; but not so continually, nor grievously, and therefore properly may be call'd <HI>The Plagues of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in Harvest-time many malignant and mortal Agues reign, by drinking the tainted and foul Water, which the Townsmen from year to year keep in their Wells under their houses. In Winter they are troubled with sore Eyes, but the Inhabitants of <HI>Cairo</HI> much more; among whom it reigns so E∣pidemically, that scarce half of them escape the Distemper. There also rages that most terrible <HI>Egyptian</HI> Disease, by the <HI>Arabians</HI> call'd <HI>Dem El Muia,</HI> which in few hours suddenly possesses the Brain like an Apoplexy, and bereaving them of sense and understanding, in few minutes irremediably kills them. Every year once are the <HI>Egyptians</HI> surprized with this Sickness, of which multitudes dye.</P>
<P>At the same time Children are much afflicted with a malignant kind of Pox bred by the venomous Damps raised from the corrupt Water of <HI>Caleg,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malignant Childrens Fox in <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> which is a Branch, or rather a Trench cut from the <HI>Nile</HI> into <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Every year,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence they arise.</NOTE> when the <HI>Nile</HI> is risen eight or ten Cubits, it falls into this Trench, and runs from thence through the whole City; and at the recess of <HI>Nile,</HI> this Water then in the <HI>Caleg,</HI> remaining without current, or motion, at length corrupts, and first becomes green, then black, and in the end sends forth a very noisome Stench; which corrupting, sends forth venomous Vapours whereby the Air is polluted, and that Infection bred; and therefore all the Children which dwell thereabout for that cause are carried thence to other places.</P>
<P>Many other Diseases are in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which are bred by the eating Ox and Camels Flesh, and rotten Salt Fish, taken in Pools, and Lakes, and mouldy stinking Cheese, by them call'd <HI>Gibnehalon:</HI> whereby is ingendered much thick Blood, Choler adust, Grossness, and soft and crude Humours.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of the Dropsie.</NOTE> The Dropsie here is very frequent, and such as have it, have Legs, which by the abundance of hardness and gross Swelling are blown and puffed up, like the Legs of Elephants; though indeed they feel no Pain, but are only unwieldy to walk. One main Cause of these Distempers proceeds from the too frequent Use of <HI>Colocasie, Beets, Bammia,</HI> and <HI>Melochia,</HI> Herbs breeding thick and tough Flegm.</P>
<P>Many of the better Sort also have a Weakness in their Joynts and Limbs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Egyptians</HI> have weak Joynts and feeble Limbs.</NOTE> like Childrens Rickets, relaxed either by immoderate Venery, or the too fre∣quent Use of Sweat-Baths:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alpin. Medicin. Egypt.</NOTE> But the meaner Sort get it by wearing the same Clothes in Winter and Summer, and going bare-foot and bare-legg'd.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And are troubled with the Stone.</NOTE> The Stone is no stranger among them, being bred from the Sediment of the Wa∣ter of <HI>Nilus,</HI> which as all Water causing Urine, comes to the Kidneys: but the more Earthy Part remaining like Dregs behind by the extraordinary Heat of the Body, becomes dry, and in a little Series of time is turned into Stones.</P>
<P>There are also many of a Melancholy Temper,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sad spirited People in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> which are generally ac∣counted Holy Men: For the vulgar perswade themselves, that they live with∣out Sin, leading their Lives in great Sanctity; the better to mind Sacred My∣steries, retiring from the World into desart and barren Places: The <HI>Mahume∣tans</HI> look upon them as <HI>Santons,</HI> because they seem to contemn Riches, and slight the vain Pleasures of the World. They live single, giving Hospitable Enter∣tainment to all Strangers of what Religion soever: They reprove Vice very sharply, affirming the World to be nothing but a Vale of Misery and Trou∣ble: In a sad and morose Reservation they denounce great Punishments to Man for Sin, and so macerate and mortifie their Bodies by a vowed Abstemi∣ousness

<P>The Pestilence is very frequent in these Parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Egypt</HI> is much afflicted with the Pestilence.</NOTE> and prevails against them the more, because they seek no Remedy for it, falsly conceiting, that God hath cer∣tainly appointed and ordained every ones Death aforehand, and the manner of his Dying; so that he that must die in the Wars, cannot die of the Pestilence, and those onely can die of the Pestilence, that are aforehand destined of God for it. For this cause, as we said, no <HI>Egyptian</HI> will go about to avoid the Place, nor shun converse with the Infected: and the Clothes and other Houshold∣stuff of such as dye of that Distemper, are instantly sold in the open Market by Out-cry, which none are afraid to buy: by which mad obstinacy in this their foolish Perswasion, the Plague in <HI>Cairo,</HI> in the space of six or seven Moneths, sometimes sweeps away above five hundred thousand People.</P>
<P>This dreadful Malady commonly begins in their first Summer,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When it commonly be∣gins in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> continuing till the cool <HI>Northern</HI> Winds arise, and then it begins to abate.</P>
<P>That which begins in the first Moneths, is the worst of all, especially if it come over out of <HI>Barbary:</HI> for then it sometimes almost depopulates whole Cities, leaving them destitute of Inhabitants: But if it comes later, it is so much the milder, and ceaseth the sooner. But although it rage never so fierce∣ly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">At the Suns entrance into <HI>Cancer,</HI> the Pestilence ceases in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> yet at the Suns entrance into <HI>Cancer,</HI> it wholly ceaseth: which by them is accounted no small Blessing: for from thence forward, as if never any such in∣fectious Disease had been, the City and all things in it are from a depth of mi∣serable despair reduced into a secure, safe, and healthful condition: Neither while the Contagion lasted, did any other Diseases appear among the People. Now the reason of this so sudden Cessation seems to be caused by the even and constant temper of the Air,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this comes to pass.</NOTE> by the blowing of the Anniversary <HI>Northwinds,</HI> which then begin to rise and oppose the moist Nature of the <HI>South-winds,</HI> call'd as we said, <HI>Campsien;</HI> which cooling as well the Air as Mens Bodies, taking away the Cause, (the infectious Heat) the Effect ceaseth.</P>
<P>Very seldom or never doth the Plague begin here from Putrifaction of the Air,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seldom does the Pesti∣lence in <HI>Egypt</HI> arise from the Putrifaction of the Air.</NOTE> unless the <HI>Nile</HI> overflowing the Countrey too high, leaves his Water a long while upon the Ground, whereby the whole Land becomes as a corrupt and standing Lake, that by the <HI>Southerly</HI> Winds, and Summer Heat, are ripened and made fit to send up infectious Vapours.</P>
<P>There being then no Natural Cause to breed this Contagion within <HI>Egypt,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pestilence is always brought over from other Places into <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> it follows that it is brought thither from other Neighbouring and Bordering Places; and especially out of <HI>Greece, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Barbary.</HI> That which is brought thither out of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> and falls upon <HI>Caire,</HI> is very milde, kills few, and holds but a short time. But when it comes from <HI>Barbary</HI> thither, it is most pernicious, and of longest continuance: Such was that in the Year Fif∣teen hundred and eighty, that raged so furiously, that in a short time it clearly swept away above five hundred thousand men.</P>
<P>By the continual rising of the Dust,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Baths are in great use among the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></NOTE> and extraordinary Sweating, the Bo∣dies of the People become foul, nasty, and verminious; and therefore Baths are of very great use to cleanse and keep them sweet and free from breeding <HI>Cattel:</HI> But the Women, with most frequency and care use Bathing, as in∣tending, or at least imagining, that such Lotions make them more pleasing to their Husbands, and to have a gracious and pleasant Scent in their Nostrils, when they come together to recreate themselves.</P>
<P>They take little care of their Hair,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alpin. de m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de. Egypt.</NOTE> ordering it slightly, according to the manner of the Countrey in a Silken Caul; but are very curious elsewhere,

<P>This frequent Bathing and Anointing they use not onely for Ornament,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fat Women are pleasing to the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></NOTE> Cleanliness, and Coolness; but especially to make them, if lean, to become plump and fat: because such Women be highly esteemed of in those Parts; by which means some grow <HI>Bona-Roba's,</HI> and others out of all mea∣sure with fathomless Wastes, like foul Sows: chiefly the <HI>Jews,</HI> whose Women are more liable to that undecent Extream.</P>
<P>All in general when they are Bathing, the sooner to facilitate their Design,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they do to be fat.</NOTE> take nourishing cool Broaths, and Cordial Jellies, on purpose made of Pin∣guefying Ingredients; to wit, <HI>Bammia, Melochia,</HI> and <HI>Colocasia.</HI></P>
<P>The poorer sort in the <HI>Bannias</HI> drink the Settling of the Oyl of <HI>Sesamus</HI> Seed, which they call <HI>Thaine</HI> or the decoction of <HI>China Roots,</HI> or the Oyl pressed out of the <HI>Indian Nuts,</HI> or the Fruit of the <HI>Turpentine-Tree, Sweet Almonds, Hasle-nuts,</HI> and <HI>Pistaches:</HI> eating besides much food, and Flesh of fatted Fowls, with the Broath boiled to a Jelly, and mixed therewith.</P>
<P>Nor do these Lotions and Unctions suffice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chasing of the Body.</NOTE> unless attended with a threefold Frication; The first is done with the naked palm of the hand, anointed with the Oyl of <HI>Sesamus;</HI> the second with a rough linnen cloth; and the third with a course cloth of Goats-hair.</P>
<P>After which they are rubbed all over with Sope, which they wash off in a Bath of warm sweet-Water.

<P>At <HI>Cairo</HI> and <HI>Alexandria</HI> great multitudes of Houses are appointed for the use of Baths, which have many Caves, Cellars, or Chambers,

<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> keep a slender and sparing Table; eating little, but often:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Egyptians</HI> feed spa∣ringly, but often.</NOTE> They are not pleased with Variety, but content themselves with one Dish of Meat at a meal: And if Flesh, eat sparingly of it, as having no great appe∣tite thereto; but when they do, they chuse Mutton simply cook'd, without either addition or Sauce to it: But of late some Merchants have begun to learn to eat Chickens.</P>
<P>They chiefly delight in moist Food;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food,</NOTE> and therefore commonly use Rice boil∣ed in preserved Juices of <HI>Linse, Erwetes, white Cives, Melochia, Beets, Melda, Coale, Bammia, Cucumers</HI> or <HI>Chate,</HI> the Roots <HI>of Colocasia, Melons, Dates, Musae Fruit, Figs, Apricocks, Peaches, Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, Granates.</HI> The poor people eat Beef, and Camels flesh; and some Fish, as Pikes or Pickerels, and many other: and among the rest the flesh of the <HI>Crocodile.</HI></P>
<P>In places near the Sea, Fish may be had in great abundance, which they eat without distinction; for the most part salted, and sometime half rotten. Milk, and all that come of it, or are made with it, is with them in very great use.</P>
<P>And as they are best pleased in simple Diet, of one kinde of Food,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They eat not many sorts of Food.</NOTE> so a lit∣tle of it contents them; For many make their Dinner and Supper, onely of Melons or Wheaten Bread; some of such simple Broth as we mentioned be∣fore; and others chew upon a green Sugar-Cane, or onely with Figs, or Grapes or Cucumers, or some such trifling Diet.</P>

<P>The common Drink of the Countrey is the <HI>Nile,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Drink.</NOTE> which is very sweet, but the <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> drink Wine also, as also some <HI>Turks,</HI> and especially the Soldiers, that often at <HI>Cairo</HI> take the Creature in such abundance, that they re∣turn home laid athwart on Asses Backs; in those mad and inebriating Fro∣licks, no more minding their Prophets Wine-forbidding Laws.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Water of <HI>Nilus</HI> very wholesom to drink.</NOTE> which by the length of his Current, and the Heat of the Sun, must needs be sufficiently concocted and made thin, is very wholesom; for as to the dregs or muddy part thereof, the <HI>Egyptians</HI> have a way to make it clear, which they do in this manner: As soon as the Water is brought home in Leathern Flasks or Bottles, they put it in long-neck'd great earthen Jugs or Jarres, with broad round Bellies, anointing the edge a little with stamp'd sweet Almonds, then taking a handful of the same, they thrust their Arm into the Water up to their Elbow, with all their strength stirring the Water about; then leaving the Almonds in it, the Water will be clear in the space of three Hours. Lastly, pouring out the clear Water into other small Vessels, they use it either for their Drink or Food. Others let this Water stand only and setle, till it become clear of it self.</P>
<P>The Vertues of this Water are very many and great,

<P>¶ MEn in <HI>Egypt</HI> live longer than in other Places, for they say,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Egyptians</HI> live long.</NOTE> 'tis usual to find People above an hundred Years old, the Reason of which Lon∣gevity, Physitians much differ about; yet in General they assign'd as one chief Cause, their spare Life in Eating and Drinking, whereas on the contrary,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alpinus de Medicina</HI> Ae∣gypt</NOTE> all <HI>Europeans</HI> which drink abundance of Wine, and eat much Flesh,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">By what means this is so.</NOTE> are for the most part short Liv'd; for as the moderate use of Flesh generates good Blood, and quickens the natural Heat, so the immoderate use incrassates the natural moi∣sture, making it become tough and viscous, so stopping the activity of Circu∣lation, with the Load of gross repletions, just as the Flame in a Lamp, by the exuberancy of the Oyl extinguisheth; therefore the <HI>Egyptians</HI> living Sparingly, and not Distempering themselves with high Fare, their Blood be∣ing thus attenuated, spins out a longer thread of Life to them, than our guz∣ling and debaucht Nations.</P>
<P>¶ THe Habits of the Men are neat, but not gorgeous;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mens Habits.</NOTE> for in the Summer time they wear Vests of the finest and lightest Cotton, but in the Win∣ter, of their own Countrey Cloth, quilted with Cotton. Their Vests are shaped narrow above, and wide below, with small Sleeves close at the Hand; over which Princes, Officers of State, and other Great Men, wear a rich Tu∣nick of Sattin, Damask, and other costly <HI>European-stuff,</HI> every one according to his State and Dignity.</P>
<P>They wear great Turbans, made of long striped Camelet,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tulhandes</HI> or <HI>Turbants.</HI></NOTE> wound or folded up round together. The Colour of which denotes of what Religion they are;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Colour of the Tur∣bant, denote the Religion.</NOTE> for the <HI>Jews</HI> wear one Yellow, the <HI>Christians</HI> Red or Blew, and the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> only a White one; but those that boast themselves, lineally descen∣ded from their Great Prophet, wear Green Turbans. Their Hose or Stock∣ings, are short, like the Buskins of the Antients, but in a manner all strangers to Shoes, for what they use on their Feet, are rather Slippers or Sandals, having no Upper-leather behind, and the Soals according to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fashion, shod with Iron.</P>
<PB N="122" REF="88"/>
<P>Ladies and Persons of Honor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of Women.</NOTE> are there for the most part cloathed in White, with Masks of the same Colour. The Countrey-Women, have in stead of a Mask, a Cotton Cloth before their Face, Black or some other Colour, at the Chin, pointed with two holes only, that they may see their Way, and where they tread: But in many Places, their <HI>Vizors</HI> follow the <HI>Turkish</HI> Mode, being a very thin Cloth, made of Horse-Hair, before their Faces; or else a∣mong the better Sort, a fine Linnen or Tiffany. They go mounted on <HI>Chop∣pines,</HI> which have no Upper-leather, but only to fasten them over to the foot.</P>
<P>Their Head-attires are various, according to the divers Customs of the Countrey, the <HI>Turkish</HI> keeping their own Fashion of being close covered, but the <HI>Egyptians</HI> wear a costly Silk Cap, half a Foot high, and running to a Point, like one of our Womens high-crown'd Hats without a Brim; on the fore-part of which they fix a Branch or Sprig, neatly compos'd of several Gems with vari∣ous Lustres, and a Frontlet of Oriental Pearls, with Chains of Gold about their Neck,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Egyptian</HI> Women wear Smocks and Peticoats lac'd at the bottom, like the Gallants of our Time.</NOTE> and Golden Bracelets on their Wrists, and Garters all of Gold: Next their Skin they wear a fine Silk Smock, bordered with curious Needle-work, and over this a Coat or Gown of a different Length, made of changeable co∣lour'd Silk, trim'd with Gold, Silver, and Silk Knots, and the Skirt richly em∣broider'd.</P>
<P>No People are more dextrous in Swimming, as compelled thereto by neces∣cesity; for at the overflowing of <HI>Nilus,</HI> they swim from place to place to dis∣patch their Affairs, and to that end are very lightly Clad, only with a Coat and Shirt, intending to Travel, which they tye upon their Heads in form of a Turbant, when they swim cross any deep Rivers; but if their Transnatation extend to a farther Distance, they have bundles of Flaggs or Bull-rushes, which as either necessity or conveniency requires, they use to Buoy themselves upon, both for their Ease and Safety. When they ride in <HI>Cavalcade</HI> through Cities in State, or through the Countrey for private Business, their Horses are unshod, cover'd after the <HI>Moorish</HI> Fashion, with Foot-clothes or Caparisons, usually made of Tapistry, wrought after the manner of the <HI>Moors;</HI> but the Women mask'd upon Mules. Mean People and Strangers use Asses, which always stand upon the parting of cross Ways ready to Hire.</P>
<P>¶ THe Houses of the plain Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> because of the overflowing of <HI>Nilus,</HI> are built upon rising Places, with thick clay Walls, and flat Roofs, as is usual in most Eastern Countreys. And in regard Wood and Stone are very scarce, they are little and low, without advantages of many Rooms, be∣cause most People Eat, Drink and Sleep under the Date-Tree for coolness, not fearing either Winter or Summer-Rains, because the Countrey is free from them. The whole Countrey is subject to one Inconvenience, which is want of Fuel; for in the great scarcity thereof, they are forced upon all necessary occa∣sions to burn the dung of Cattel.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>POlygamy</HI> is common among the Nobler Sort,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Marriage.</NOTE> who shut up their many Wives together in a <HI>Seraglio,</HI> but separate from one another in distinct Apartments. The <HI>Moors</HI> and meaner Sort, to shew their Affection when they go a Wooing, sear their Flesh with red hot Irons, and flash their Arms, without any sense of Smart or Danger. And if by that means they can obtain the bare reward of a single Kiss from their Mistris Hand, they take it as if they had gain'd the top of Felicity, or whatsoever Love-sick Amours desire.</P>

<P>¶ THe Parents dispose their Daughters in Marriage at ten, or at most at twelve year old.

<P>There are another sort of People here call'd <HI>Beduines,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the <HI>Bedu∣ines.</HI></NOTE> wandring about in great Companies, of two or three hundred, with their Luggage upon Carts, and driving their Cattel like the <HI>Tartars,</HI> from place to place for fresh Pasturage: and where they finde good Grass, they spread their Tents of course Goats-hair Cloth, and thence migrate up and down still for fresh Pasture.</P>
<P>The Men are most of them Smiths, and Weavers; they go meanly appa∣rell'd, without any Clothes, but a blue or gray Shirt, with broad Sleaves hang∣ing down to the ground, and a piece of Cloth, call'd by them <HI>Baracan,</HI> which sometimes they cast over their shoulders as a Mantle; when they pitch, they sometimes make that their Tent to sleep under in the night, and in the day to skreen off the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>The Women go for the most part clothed like the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> having maskt their Faces with holes. They stick in their Hair many Silver and Copper Plates, and black Ear-rings and Jewels of an unusual bigness; and the like on their Arms. The Daughters, as they become marriagable, manifest it by scratching themselves upon the Chin and Lip, which they dawb over with Ink and Ox-gall mingled; that give such a fixt tincture as will never wear out.</P>

<P>Whence the Name <HI>Coptos</HI> or <HI>Copta</HI> took its Original, Writers disagree.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tongue <HI>Copta,</HI> why so named.</NOTE> <HI>Atha∣nasius
<PB N="124" REF="89"/>Kircher</HI> seems among all to have come nearest, deriving it from <HI>Coptos,</HI> formerly the most famous City in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the Chief of the Countrey of <HI>Thebes;</HI> though at this day the Ruines thereof are but mean: or else from the <HI>Coptists,</HI> the Inhabitants of that City, by whom alone this Tongue was kept in being.</P>
<P>Here we may take notice of a great mistake among most eminent Writers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difference between <HI>Coptos</HI> and <HI>Cophtos.</HI></NOTE> who without distinction confound <HI>Coptos</HI> and <HI>Cophtos;</HI> whereas they differ much in their signification. <HI>Coptos</HI> is an antique word, and found in old Authors; but <HI>Cophtos</HI> is a Name invented by the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> who call the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Chri∣stians by way of derision <HI>Cophtites;</HI> as if they would say, <HI>Circumcised.</HI> Some suppose they are call'd <HI>Cophtites,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Della Valla.</NOTE> because they followed heretofore the Erroneous and Heretical Opinions of <HI>Eutiches</HI> and <HI>Dioscorus,</HI> condemned in the Council of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> which did before Baptism use to receive Circumcision; (for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is onely a <HI>Greek</HI> Name, and signifies <HI>Circumcised</HI>) whence they were nick-nam'd <HI>Christians of the Girdle,</HI> meaning upwards; because from the Girdlested down∣wards, being Circumcised, they were rather <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>The present <HI>Cophtick Tongue,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Coptick</HI> is the old <HI>E∣gyptian</HI> Tongue.</NOTE> is not onely like the Antient <HI>Egyptian,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Pharao's,</HI> but altogether one and the same, as appears by some words still in use; and among the rest the Names of the Moneths, whereby the Old <HI>Egyptians</HI> and the Modern <HI>Coptists</HI> name them without any remarkable difference. The like you may observe in the Planets.</P>
<P><HI>Mars</HI> was with the Antient <HI>Egyptians Moloch,</HI> which the Holy Scripture so often mentions;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Remphan</HI> in our <HI>English</HI> Translations.</NOTE> <HI>Saturn, Refan,</HI> the very word used in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles; Venus</HI> is called <HI>Zahara:</HI> and many Plants and Herbs, mentioned by <HI>Apuleius</HI> in his Book <HI>of the Vertues of Herbs,</HI> may be found very little different from the present <HI>Egyptian</HI> Names. Now since no Tongue comes nearer to the old <HI>E∣gyptian,</HI> than the <HI>Coptick,</HI> we may rationally conclude, that the <HI>Coptick</HI> is the true and antient <HI>Egyptian,</HI> not so pure and undefiled indeed, as it was in the time of the <HI>Patriarchs;</HI> but by process of time, the manifest mixture of People and Languages, and other alterations of the State disguised and corrupted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coptick</HI> in it self is an Original,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its distinction from the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue.</NOTE> not a Derivative Language, though some strongly argue, that it is but a <HI>Greek Dialect,</HI> differing as the <HI>Caldee</HI> from the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> It is true, that in <HI>Coptick Dictionaries,</HI> brought from <HI>Egypt</HI> by <HI>Peter Della Valla,</HI> many words sound like the <HI>Greek;</HI> but it is to be observed withall, that this Tongue had not that mixture at the beginning, but it fell in in the time of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and the <HI>Ptolomys,</HI> by the mutual Converse of <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> together, for three hundred years. And by the same means also <HI>Latine, Arabick, Hebrew,</HI> and <HI>Samaritane</HI> Words are blended with it; but this is not sufficient to root out its Original Purity.</P>
<P><HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> sets down so great an Agreement between the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Egyptian Tongue,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the <HI>Hebrew.</HI></NOTE> that he seems to maintain those People might very easily have understood one another; but this contradicts that <HI>Psalm,</HI> which speaking of <HI>Joseph,</HI> hath these words: <HI>When he passed into Egypt, he heard a Language which he knew not.</HI> Besides, If there were so great an Agreement, it must have arisen either by Trading or Converse; of both which the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as the Scripture witnesseth, were utterly debarr'd.</P>
<P><HI>Gesner,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And from other <HI>Eastern</HI> Tongues.</NOTE> Volateranus, Eusebius, Ambrose,</HI> and <HI>Theseus</HI> seem to assert, That the <HI>Egyptian Tongue</HI> hath some relation to the <HI>Abyssine, Caldee, Arabick, Syriack,</HI> and other <HI>Oriental Languages,</HI> moved by a similitude of Sound: and for that like the <HI>Hebrews, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Caldeans,</HI> they use Letters instead of Arithmetical Characters.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="89"/>
<P>But this Opinion stands upon a loose Foundation; for there are great Diffe∣rences between this and the other <HI>Eastern Tongues,</HI> as well in manner of Pro∣nunciation, as in Words: As for example; The <HI>Hebrews</HI> call Father and Son; <HI>Ab-U-Ben;</HI> The <HI>Caldeys, Abba-Ubra;</HI> The <HI>Syrians, Abo Vabro;</HI> The <HI>Arabians, El∣lab Vallabu;</HI> The <HI>Abyssines, Vb Wawalda;</HI> The <HI>Armenians, Hor eu Ordi;</HI> The <HI>Sa∣maritans, Ab-U-ben;</HI> The <HI>Egyptian Copticks, Fiot Nemsiri:</HI> Hereby appears the great Agreement of the <HI>Eastern Tongues</HI> among themselves; but not in the least with the <HI>Coptick:</HI> for what likeness have the words <HI>Fiot Nemsiri,</HI> with <HI>Ab Uben, Abo Vabro, Ab Uben, Ab Wawolda,</HI> &amp;c.? Accordingly <HI>Theseus</HI> concludes, That the Analogy of several Speeches in one or two words, makes no more to prove them the same, than that Stone and Timber are <HI>Identicals,</HI> because both grow in the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coptick</HI> hath this peculiar Property; That all the Words thereof used by a Stranger, receive alteration in the first Syllable, and not in the terminati∣on or ultimate, usual in other Languages: Neither at this day are any Books remaining of it, onely a few words have been preserved by <HI>Greek</HI> and other Writers of most Antiquity.</P>
<P>Authors disagree about their Characters;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letters of the Anti∣ent <HI>Egyptians.</HI></NOTE> however we have reason to conclude, that they were taken from the form and postures of the whole Bo∣dies of Beasts, by them accounted Sacred; when they intended to signifie whatever in it self is great. The minute or lesser matters were exprest by their several parts or members.</P>
<P>As they endeavored in their holy Language to perform all their matters by Mysteries, so they did also in the vulgar <HI>Coptick,</HI> as will plainly appear by their Alphabet, consisting of two and twenty Letters: wherein few but signifies some deep Mystery. The second Letter in its Figure, represents the form of a Capital <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Gamma,</HI> and signifies <HI>A Carpenters
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Square is a Carpen∣ters Rule, by which they measure their square Lines: it is made of Iron.</NOTE> Square;</HI> but mystically intends the rule or method of square and honest dealings, which God the Great Fabrica∣tor of the World hath set down and fixt as a Law in our Nature, that a Qua∣drary Proportion should rule all Actions which we call just and vertuous. In like manner, under all the other Letters, according to their specifical diffe∣rences, lay hid other peculiar and deep Mysteries. Besides this, they had an∣other manner of Writing: so that it seems the other were onely used as Sacred <HI>Hieroglyphicks,</HI> to set forth great Secrets: As a Testimony whereof several <HI>Mummies</HI> have been found, upon whose gilded and gummed Winding-Clothes many <HI>Coptick</HI> Letters were inscribed, being no small evidence to prove the An∣tiquity: because the <HI>Mummies</HI> were Interred long before the Invasion of <HI>Cam∣byses,</HI> who destroyed or banished the Priests, by which it was lost, as we have often mentioned.</P>
<P>But neither could its Antiquity or Sacred Use preserve it from being abo∣lisht, as at this day it almost is: The <HI>Arabick</HI> having generally prevailed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Coptick</HI> Tongue is not spoken any more.</NOTE> one∣ly some Christians have retained still a small Remainder, in Celebrating their Liturgy, and having a few of their Religious Books written in it; as among the rest, the Books of the <HI>Old and New Testament,</HI> translated out of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> into that Language above fourteen hundred Years since; when the now ru∣in'd <HI>Thebes</HI> was the famous Patroness of Religion, as <HI>Nicephorus</HI> reports:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nicephorus.</NOTE> There is also a <HI>Coptick</HI> Dictionary, of about six thousand Words, with the <HI>Ara∣bick</HI> by it, preserv'd and kept in <HI>Egypt:</HI> and another, which that Worthy Searcher into Antiquities, <HI>Peter della Valla,</HI> brought with him thence, in the Year Sixteen hundred twenty and four, which in the same order, with
<PB N="126" REF="90"/><HI>Latine</HI> Interpretations, was twenty Years after published in Print at <HI>Rome,</HI> by the Learned Father <HI>Athanasius Kircher,</HI> who had also before that Published an Introduction to the <HI>Coptick</HI> Tongue, wherein he treats largely of its Antiquity, Original and Difference from other Tongues, together with the Knowledge of the Letters, and the Means both of Restoring and Reforming it.</P>
<P>The Sacred <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tongue,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Consecrated or Sa∣cred <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tongue.</NOTE> consists of comprehensive Representations, by <HI>Philo Judaeus</HI> call'd <HI>Figures of Living Creatures,</HI> and by the <HI>Greeks, Hieroglyphicks,</HI> that only denote by Mystical Figures holy Matters. These were found out with great Sagacity, and consist no way in the Apprehension of Letters, Words or Sentences; As a <HI>Basilisk,</HI> with the Tail twin'd about its Body, signifies the Course of Time; a Serpent, with the Tail in its Mouth, the World; a Branch of Palm, the Moon, because a Palm, at the beginning of every New Moon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Palm shoots forth a fresh Branch every Moon.</NOTE> sends forth a new Branch, so that in a Year it shooteth forth thirteen new Branches, as they observe.</P>
<P>These <HI>Hieroglyphicks</HI> contain a compleat Sence, in what manner soever it be expressed, whether Beneath or Above, or on the Right or Left Side; for upon the Obelisks or Spires they stand perpendicular; upon Flats for Painting, they stand as we write, Level; but upon Rounds of Metal or Marble Statues or what other Representations, they march strait up or down, athwart or promis∣cuous without Order. Also observe, that the Sages did not grave upon Stone their Histories, as many now suppose, or the Famous Acts of their Kings and Princes, or the Liberal Arts, or any other such like Argument, but only what was Holy, and which had respect either to the Properties of the Divine Nature, or to the Orders of Angels and Spirits, or to the Tuition of Corps interr'd.</P>
<P>These were written not only upon Stones, but also upon Winding-Sheets, and Funeral-Cloaths of <HI>Mummies,</HI> made either of Paper, Wood, or burnt Brick, or the like Matter, as is declared in the Description of the <HI>Mummies.</HI> But generally the whole Body of this Learning was cut upon Stone, and set up in several Places in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as upon Temple-doors, Obelisks, or Images of the Gods, that they might remain Remarks to all Posterity. They make
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mercurius Trismegistus.</NOTE> <HI>Hermes</HI> the first Inventer of these consecrated Figures, whom the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Adris;</HI> He was a Priest, and the greatest Wise-Man in all <HI>Egypt,</HI> and flourished in the time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> under the Government of the first <HI>Egyptian</HI> King <HI>Mizraim.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Hieroglyphical Learning</HI> was so highly Esteemed by the <HI>Egpptians</HI> ever since its first Beginning,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was in high Esteem.</NOTE> that the Priests, who only understood it, might teach it to none but those of their own Order. <HI>Moses</HI> himself, according to the Scri∣ptures, was indued with all the Wisdom and Learning of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> which according to the Exposition of <HI>Philo Judaeus,</HI> chiefly consisted in this Divine Philosophy,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When it was destroyed.</NOTE> which since the Conquest of <HI>Egypt</HI> by <HI>Cambyses,</HI> is so wholly lost, that there is scarce any Remainders to be found.</P>
<P>¶ A At present the Native <HI>Egyptians</HI> speak <HI>Arabick</HI> or the <HI>Morisk Language,</HI> so do the <HI>Coptists,</HI> only their Church-Service or Liturgies are celebrated in the <HI>Coptick,</HI> with an <HI>Arabick</HI> Explanation. The <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Cairo</HI> for the most part speak a mixt Language, a meer Gally-maufry hasht together of all usual Tongues, now call'd <HI>Lingua Franca.</HI></P>

<PB N="131" REF="92"/>come out of <HI>Christendom</HI> pay one and twenty in the Hundred; and those that come out of the <HI>Grand Seigniors</HI> Countreys, ten in the Hundred. The Wood brought from the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> gives twenty in the Hundred: This Customer is like our Clerk of the Market, overseeing Weights and Measures, for which he ha's a Salary of twelve or fifteen Bags yearly.</P>
<P>The third <HI>Douan,</HI> is that of <HI>Damiata,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Douan</HI> of <HI>Damiata.</HI></NOTE> for which the Farmer pays yearly to the <HI>Divan,</HI> two Chests of Gold, worth twenty thousand <HI>Seriffs;</HI> to the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> fif∣teen, and to the <HI>Tihaia</HI> four Bags, and to the Souldiers of both the Castles lying at the mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> being an hundred and twenty four, to each six <HI>Medins</HI> a Moneth. The Revenue hereof ariseth from Imported Commodities and Merchandise from <HI>Turky,</HI> as Corn, Oyl, Soap, and Almonds; or other Com∣modities brought from <HI>Gaza, Zeida,</HI> and <HI>Damas,</HI> which all pay ten in the Hun∣dred. Many <HI>Saiques</HI> also from <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Cyprus</HI> come laden with Rice, Beans, Pease, or Rent-Corn, and Flax, Sugar, and Canes.</P>
<P>The fourth is that of <HI>Brule,</HI> whose Revenue grows from <HI>Dadle</HI> or <HI>Dates,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Douan</HI> of <HI>Brule.</HI></NOTE> and other Fruits; but chiefly from the Fish that caught in great abundance, are salted and sent to <HI>Candia,</HI> and other places. The Customer pays to the <HI>Ba∣shaw</HI> two Bags and a half, one to the <HI>Tihaia,</HI> and to the <HI>Divan</HI> four: The <HI>Metas∣soup,</HI> that is, he who sets the Price upon all Victuals, inhances upon the poor In∣habitants, to raise for the <HI>Bashaw</HI> thirteen Bags.</P>
<P>The fifth, call'd <HI>Caddare,</HI> is that of <HI>Boulak;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Douan Caddare.</NOTE> for which the Farmer gives the <HI>Bashaw</HI> fifteen Bags, the <HI>Tihaia</HI> and <HI>Agaes</HI> five, and the <HI>Divan</HI> sixty four. His In∣come proceeds from the Custom of Flax, of which yearly there is spun and weaved two hundred thousand Quintals at <HI>Boulak,</HI> besides an hundred thousand sent to <HI>Damiata.</HI> Of Corn, which is brought to <HI>Old Caire,</HI> of which the Farmer takes six Bags, and six other of the Green-water Melons, and the like; which in all amounts to twenty and four thousand Bags: The remainder is upon Tobacco and other Merchandise coming from <HI>Turky,</HI> of which some afford ten in the Hundred, some less. He also receiveth of every Camel laden with Merchandise, going to <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Mecha,</HI> four <HI>Piasters,</HI> as a certain Summe of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> which come from <HI>Damas, Gaza,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> living in the <HI>Grand Seigniors</HI> Countreys,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pole-Money of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians.</HI></NOTE> at sixteen years of Age, pay every one Head by Head a certain Price, yearly amounting to eight and forty Bags. There are in <HI>Cairo</HI> above eight hundred Camels ap∣pointed to draw water; all which pay a certain Tax imposed on them at the <HI>Bashaw</HI>'s pleasure. So do the poor people which carry water upon their backs in Goat-Skins through the whole City, each of whom, being thirty thou∣sand in number, give to the <HI>Bashaw</HI> for his Licence what he lays upon them.</P>
<P>Trading and Merchandise is not in such flourishing state as formerly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchandising.</NOTE> be∣cause of the danger of the ways which the <HI>Grand Siegnior</HI> hath endeavoured by all means to secure; but without any success; so that at present <HI>Cairo</HI> that was wont to furnish Christendom, is now from thence supplied with <HI>Cassia, Cina∣mon, Nutmegs, Pepper, Ginger, Purcellaen,</HI> and other Spicery.</P>
<P>The Merchandise there had at present, is <HI>Rice, Sugar, Flax, Tamarinds,</HI> and <HI>Linnen.</HI> From the Borders of <HI>Hymen</HI> comes still much <HI>Frankincense;</HI> and from the Skirts of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> or <HI>Negro-Land, Turkish</HI> and <HI>Arabian Gums, Feathers,</HI> and some Drugs.</P>
<P>They have in <HI>Cairo, Bazars,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Market-places, or <HI>Bazars</HI></NOTE> the chiefest of which are the Rows of the <HI>Mer∣cers</HI> and <HI>Druggists.</HI> There are also stately Houses, which they call <HI>Ochelles,</HI> where they sell <HI>Blackamores,</HI> wherein are divisions to keep <HI>Whites</HI> to sell; where Men will yield from twenty to sixty Pieces of Eight, and Women especially <HI>Whites,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="93"/>five hundred <HI>Piasters;</HI> yea, a thousand, according to their Beauty: yet no <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> may bring a Slave to Land on pain of his life.</P>
<P>In the Market of <HI>Cairo</HI> are also great Sacks of <HI>Jett</HI> brought to be sold in pieces two handfuls thick, being in great esteem among the <HI>Arabians, Syrians,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians;</HI> because they make of them Beads, which they tell over Religi∣ously: and sometimes deck their Hair with them.</P>
<P>The Powder of <HI>Alcanna</HI> is in such repute, that whole Ship-Ladings are sent to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and is of so general use in all the <HI>Eastern</HI> Countreys subordi∣nate to the <HI>Turk,</HI> that the Revenue amounts yearly to eighteen thousand <HI>Sulta∣nies,</HI> or <HI>Ducats.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Mala,</HI> being under the <HI>Cassiffe</HI> of <HI>Garbia,</HI> every two days is held a Market of Cattel, and all sorts of Commodities, call'd <HI>Chec Ahmet Elbodoin.</HI> In <HI>Hayman</HI> or <HI>Hiemen</HI> are found some Precious Stones, as the <HI>Cornalines,</HI> or <HI>Cornelians,</HI> the <HI>Sardis,</HI> or <HI>Sardonicks.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Antient <HI>Egyptians</HI> observed onely a <HI>Lunar</HI> Year: But seeing this manner of Reckoning did not agree with their Affairs, but was discommodious, they brought it, according to <HI>Censorinus,</HI> from one to three Moneths, and after that to four. But here we must observe, all the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did not compute their Year according to the Course of the Moon: for a great part observed the <HI>Solar</HI> Year, but yet not the same that is now in use, for it contained no more than three hundred and sixty Days, which they divided into twelve Moneths, gi∣ving each Moneth thirty Days.</P>
<P>This Computation was a long while used, then at length growing skilful∣ler by experience in the Course of the Heavens, and the Suns Annual Motion; they added to the said three hundred and sixty, five more, which they call'd <HI>Nisi:</HI> which year afterward was generally received for the true Civil Year, and according to <HI>Horapolla</HI> call'd <HI>Gods Year:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch.</NOTE> For the <HI>Egyptians</HI> call'd the Sun <HI>God,</HI> and therefore it is not strange, that the <HI>Sun's Year</HI> by them should be call'd <HI>The Year of God.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="365"/> Every four years with them consisted barely of fourteen hundred and six∣ty Days: <MILESTONE N="4"/> But <HI>Gods Year,</HI> fourteen hundred and sixty one Days. Then at length among the <HI>Egyptians</HI> the <HI>Civil Year</HI> was brought to the <HI>Solar</HI> or <HI>Sun's Year,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1460"/> that is, every Year was lengthened a quarter of a Day, <MILESTONE N="1461"/> that is, to three hundred sixty five Days and six Hours; for in so much time the Sun finisht his Course round the <HI>Zodiack;</HI> and the fourth Year, with the lengthening of one Day, by the putting together of the four-times six hours, made it a Leap-year: Now that the making a Leap-year in this manner was in use among the old <HI>Egyptians,</HI> among others <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> gives us to understand in these words,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diodorus Siculus.</NOTE> where he says; <HI>That the days among the</HI> Egyptians <HI>were not reckoned by the Moon, but according to the course of the Sun; so that they gave every Moneth thirty days, and to the twelfth Moneth they added five days with a quarter of a day, that in this manner they might have a perfect course or circuit of the Year.</HI> And this among the <HI>Egyptians</HI> was so antient, that they had it long before <HI>Alexander the Great</HI>'s coming thither; not learning it from, but rather teaching it to the <HI>Romans,</HI> as <HI>Eudoxus, Plato</HI>'s Disciple, testifies: who having by Services and by great Study dived into this knowledge, taught it the <HI>Grecians</HI> in his own Countrey, as <HI>Strabo</HI> affirms.</P>
<P>As the Year so settled was generally call'd <HI>Gods;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods year.</NOTE> so was also every year of the four call'd by the name of one of the chiefest of their Gods: The first they call'd <HI>Sothis,</HI> or <HI>Thoth,</HI> that is, Dog; from the Dog-Star, for that they
<PB N="133" REF="93"/>began their year at the rising of that Star; The second bore the name of <HI>Isis,</HI> or <HI>Serapis;</HI> The third of <HI>Osiris,</HI> and the fourth of <HI>Horus,</HI> which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> also call'd <HI>Kemin.</HI> Wherefore, when they would represent the four years, they made the Figure of <HI>Hermes</HI> or <HI>Mercury,</HI> with a Dogs Face, standing upon a Cro∣codile with a Bowl in his hand. At his right side <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> at the left <HI>Sera∣pis</HI> with a Figure of <HI>Nilus</HI> upon his head, and an Image of a Star, representing according to <HI>Manilius, Isis.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Coptists</HI> and <HI>Abyssines</HI> keep the same reckoning, onely changing the names of the <HI>Heathenish Gods,</HI> into those of the <HI>Four Evangelists;</HI> calling the first year <HI>Matthew,</HI> the second year <HI>Mark,</HI> the third <HI>Luke,</HI> and the fourth <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this forementioned Civil and large year, for Civil affairs, there was by the Priests and Astronomers another current year in use, which they term'd <HI>The Mystical Year,</HI> and consisted of three hundred sixty and five days, bare: By which means, in four years they lost one full day; and in forty years ten: Wherefore the time of their Festivals, instituted for the Honor of their Gods, every year came so many days earlier: For <HI>Geminus</HI> affirms, That the Feast of the Goddess <HI>Isis,</HI> which in the time of <HI>Eudoxus</HI> fell in the <HI>Winter Solstice,</HI> in his time came a whole moneth sooner. This moveable Course of the Festivals was done by the Contrivance of the Priests, that they might not Celebrate them always upon one and the same time of the year; resolving that they should run through all the Seasons: For the Gods, according to their opini∣on, in fourteen hundred and sixty years make Progress over all Countreys and Places of the World, and pass through all the Degrees of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> and the days of the Moneth in process of time, that no place of the World, nor part of year should be debarr'd of their necessary presence. Thus far of the Computation of the Year among the Old <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>The Modern <HI>Christian Copticks</HI> observe a threefold Accompt;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Modern Accompt of the Year among the <HI>Cop∣ticks.</HI></NOTE> The first from the Creation of the World, and with them observed by most of the <HI>Eastern</HI> People; and in <HI>Arabick</HI> call'd <HI>Abrahams Epocha.</HI></P>
<P>The second accounts from the beginning of the <HI>Grecian Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>The third from <HI>Nabonassar,</HI> King of the <HI>Caldees:</HI> But this used by the Astro∣nomers onely, was little known.</P>
<P>There is a fourth Accompt used by the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> and that is the Emperour <HI>Dioclesian</HI>'s, introduced by him in the nineteenth year of his Reign, being the year of Christ, Three hundred and two: It begins the twenty eighth of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI> Old, or the Eighth of <HI>September,</HI> New Stile, in the first Moneth <HI>Thoth.</HI> They call it in the <HI>Arabick,</HI> from the City <HI>Captos, Tarich Elkupti,</HI> that is, <HI>The Coptick Calendar;</HI> and by the <HI>Copticks, The holy Martyrs Calendar,</HI> or, <HI>The Year of Grace;</HI> and by the <HI>Abyssines</HI> in that Countrey Language, <HI>Amath Mahareth,</HI> that is, <HI>The Year of Grace and Mercy;</HI> because of the great Persecution which the Christians at that time suffered under the same <HI>Dioclesian;</HI> when about <HI>Coptos</HI> onely were Martyr'd an hundred and forty four thousand. The reason of introducing which Accompt, we will in short set down.</P>
<P>When <HI>Dioclesian</HI> reign'd, seiz'd with a raging Fury, he not only insulted with strange arrogance over the Christians, casting them to wilde Beasts, and exer∣cising against them all other kinds of savage Cruelty; but endeavoured by all means to extirpate their Name, and to that purpose he put in practise, and commanded to destroy and burn up all their Religious Books, supposing when that was done, they would easily be brought to the practise of their <HI>Heathen Rites,</HI> and accordingly upon the twenty fifth day of <HI>March,</HI> being then <HI>Easter-day,</HI> the
<PB N="134" REF="94"/>said <HI>Dioclesian</HI> and his Colleque <HI>Maximian,</HI> commanded and published Edicts to that end, that all the Churches of the Christians, in <HI>Egypt</HI> especially, and about <HI>Thebes,</HI> should be thrown to the Ground, and the Books of their Religion destroyed. And in the second place, the antient manner of the Years used by the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> he made to be fitted to the <HI>Roman</HI> Stile, and that Account he named from himself, <HI>Dioclesian;</HI> in which last he so far prevailed, that it took place even among the Christians, so long as Heathenism continued, and until the time of the Abbot <HI>Dionysius.</HI></P>

<P>The first <HI>Arabian Calif</HI> was called <HI>Omar,</HI> who to that end sent a strong Army, under the Conduct of his Lieutenant <HI>Ambre,</HI> son of <HI>Albas,</HI> to <HI>Cairo,</HI> over which at that time, in the <HI>Greek Emperors</HI> Name, presided as his Deputy or Vice-Roy, <HI>Makaubare,</HI> who compounded with <HI>Ambre</HI> upon these Terms: <HI>That every Inhabi∣tant should pay a Gold</HI> Esku; <HI>That the</HI> Arabians <HI>should be entertained three days in all places where they pass through; and that the Citizens should pay to the</HI> Calif <HI>a yearly Revenue of twenty hundred thousand</HI> Eskues. The year following <HI>Ambre</HI> won <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and so brought all <HI>Egypt</HI> under the Command of the <HI>Arabian Califs,</HI> and there∣upon took upon him, in the <HI>Califs</HI> Name, the Dominion of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as his Gover∣nour: From thence it was ordered by Deputies, until the year Eight hundred fifty and one, when <HI>Calif Mutamid</HI> dividing his whole Empire, gave his Bro∣ther among many other Countreys, <HI>Egypt,</HI> who held it fifty years and upward. Then in the year Nine hundred and four, <HI>Calif Muktatos</HI> made it Provincial; but the <HI>Calif Abubekre</HI> adding to it whatever the <HI>Syrians</HI> had possessed, <HI>Muhamed Abuhur</HI> succeeded him with the Title of King, and after him <HI>Casur.</HI></P>
<P>In the year Eleven hundred thirty and five, <HI>Ali Abulmansar</HI> after his Fathers Death came to the Throne, and Reign'd to the year Eleven hundred sixty and three, at which time <HI>Syracon</HI> or <HI>Xarracon,</HI> call'd by others <HI>Asereddin Schirachoch,</HI> an <HI>Armenian,</HI> General or first <HI>Vizier</HI> of the King of <HI>Damas,</HI> who had sent him with an Army to the assistance of the dispossess'd <HI>Souldan Sanat,</HI> against the new <HI>Souldan Dargon;</HI> by his lucky Conquest and victorious Arms, taking captive the <HI>Calif</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> made himself Master there, with the Title of <HI>Sultan</HI> or <HI>Souldan.</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="95"/>After whose death his Brother <HI>Joseph Nazir Saladin</HI> took Possession, and by the overthrow of the former <HI>Calif Etzar,</HI> so setled the Government, that it conti∣nued in that Name and Race till the year One thousand two hundred and forty two, when the <HI>Mamalucks,</HI> the off-spring of a People on the Banks of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> vulgarly call'd <HI>The Circassians,</HI> and by <HI>Melechsala, The seventh Calif,</HI> of <HI>Shirachochs</HI> Race made his Guard, knowing their own strength, and finding a fit opportunity by the Murder of their Lord, made themselves Lords of the Coun∣trey, appointing for their Prince one <HI>Tarquimenis,</HI> born in <HI>Turcomania;</HI> in whose Race the Possession continu'd from 1255. (for <HI>Elmutan</HI> the Son of <HI>Melechsala</HI> held War with them till then) until the year 1517.</P>
<P>The last <HI>Souldan</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> was call'd <HI>Tomumbey,</HI> the second of that Name,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The last <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> which by the Warlike <HI>Mamalucks,</HI> for his Vertue and Honesty, was elected <HI>Sul∣tan,</HI> who having Wars with the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor <HI>Selim,</HI> and defeated by him in Battel, fled to <HI>Cairo,</HI> where taken captive, betrayed and deliver'd up by a <HI>Moorish</HI> Prince, he was miserably in the said year, Fifteen hundred and seventeen, Murder'd, and his Body ty'd to the Tail of a Camel and dragg'd through <HI>Cairo.</HI> This, with the Victory the year before gain'd against <HI>Souldan Campson Gauri,</HI> so ruin'd the power of the <HI>Mamalucks,</HI> that ever since, <HI>Egypt</HI> together with other Countreys and Kingdoms, by their Courage and Conduct, kept in Subjection above Three hundred years, as before is mentioned, fell under the Com∣mand of the <HI>Turkish Empire,</HI> to which with <HI>Cayar-Bey,</HI> and <HI>Gazelle,</HI> most of the <HI>Mamalucks</HI> joyned themselves, though indeed <HI>Gazelle, Souldan</HI> of <HI>Apamee</HI> and <HI>Aman,</HI> the most Noblest of the <HI>Mamalucks,</HI> held War a long time; but finding his Power too weak, at length he submitted with his Forces, and was receiv'd into Favor by <HI>Selim,</HI> and made Governor over <HI>Syria,</HI> which Office he perform'd till the death of <HI>Selim,</HI> with great Care and Fidelity; but after his death <HI>Gazelle</HI> be∣gan to strengthen himself with Soldiers, and endeavoured to draw to his Par∣ty <HI>Cayar-Bey,</HI> though in vain, for he perfidiously put to death the Messengers; yet <HI>Gazelle</HI> did not leave his Enterprize unattempted, but with a great Army drew into the Field, though without any remarkable success.</P>
<P><HI>Mamaluck</HI> signifieth in the <HI>Syriack, A mercenary Soldier;</HI> they were always kept in the Pay of the <HI>Souldan</HI> or <HI>Sultan,</HI> being chiefly Horse, and the most of them Christians, or children of Christians; for <HI>Arabians, Saracens, Moors, Turks</HI> nor <HI>Jews,</HI> may not be received into their Society.</P>
<P>The greatest part of them were of <HI>Circassia,</HI> on the Banks of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> as we said, where the <HI>Turks</HI> call them also <HI>Cercas</HI> or <HI>Zercas,</HI> and we <HI>Circassiers.</HI> These, saith <HI>Jovius,</HI> were taken in their Infancy by the <HI>Valaques, Tartars, Precopi∣tans, Podolians,</HI> and the Inhabitants of <HI>Roxolania,</HI> and sold to the Merchants, who chose out the strongest and stoutest, which they brought over the <HI>Midland-Sea</HI> to the <HI>Souldan,</HI> who at <HI>Cairo</HI> caused them to be brought up in the Exercise of Arms as soon as they came to Age, and learn'd to draw a strong Bow, and shoot at a Mark with extraordinary Aim and Steddiness; the whole Science of Defence, and the exercise of their Arms for Battel, Riding and well managing of Horses; they received Pay of the <HI>Souldan,</HI> and were immediately listed into the Number of his Life-Guard. Thus these <HI>Mamalucks</HI> being in no likelihood to attain any Honour, Office or Maintenance, but by their Valor and Courage, so enured themselves to Martial Discipline, that of despicable Bond-men and purchased Slaves, many of them became great Captains and mighty Princes.</P>
<P>This Government of the <HI>Mamaluck Souldans</HI> was Elective, for no Son might by right Succeed his Father, but went away content with the Heirship of his
<PB N="138" REF="96"/>personal Estate. In the Election, every <HI>Mamaluck</HI> had a voice, and as soon as a <HI>Souldan</HI> was chosen, required of him a <HI>Serif</HI> or Ducat of Gold.</P>

<P>The <HI>Great Turk</HI> sends commonly every Three years a new <HI>Bashaw</HI> from <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> although for these fifty or sixty Years none of them hath continued in his Office for a whole Year; nay, sometimes in Three Moneths there have been two new <HI>Bashaws.</HI> If a <HI>Bashaw</HI> offend the Commons, especially the Leaders among them, he is instantly as they say there, <HI>Manzoul;</HI> that is, without Au∣thority, and secluded apart, sometime within, sometime without the Castle; and in his Place, the <HI>Kai Macam,</HI> that is, the antientest of the <HI>Sanjacks</HI> is sub∣stituted, who often performs the Place better than himself. That this is most certain, we have a fresh Example that happen'd but in the year Sixteen hundred and thirty.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet Bashaw,</HI> Nephew to the <HI>Grand Vizier, Kampson Bashaw,</HI> General of the Army for the <HI>Grand Signieur</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> after his coming and Reception in <HI>Cairo,</HI> stay'd there about five Moneths, obliging all the Great Ones of the Countrey to him, and putting to death five or six very Rich but intollerable Oppressors and Squeezers of the poor People. At length in the year Sixteen hundred and thirty, <HI>Gaetai Bey,</HI> one of the richest Men in <HI>Egypt,</HI> very ambitious, and who had cast an eye upon the Kingdom, came at eight of the Clock in the Morning to visit the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> who received him with more than ordinary Kindness, and shewing him greater Honor than expected. After much Discourse held on both Sides, and the Conclusion of the <HI>Beys</HI> Business, which continued about two Hours, he invited him to taste a dish of <HI>Sorbet</HI> and <HI>Coffee;</HI> which done, and he about to depart, the <HI>Bashaw</HI> accompanied him three or four steps over a∣gainst Door of his Chamber on that side of the Room where he gave audience; and then told him, That he had a Letter from the <HI>Grand Signieur,</HI> which con∣tain'd a Command to send him his Head, upon the penalty of his own, and without more words, <HI>Bey</HI> having no time to escape, was immediately taken and brought through the Gallery of the Room, by the side of the Place, where usu∣ally Water is to wash himself; there was he beheaded, and the head instantly thrown through the Window of the Room upon the open Place, as also the Trunk or Corps through the Gallery of the <HI>Chiaus</HI> in the same Place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bashaw,</HI> a man of solid Judgment, and full of Courage, of the Age of five and thirty Years, withdrew himself without any tumult; but as soon as it was Published, he was surrounded with five or six Thousand <HI>Janizaries,</HI> whom he satisfied with Reasons. On the Morrow, the Great Men all assembled to∣gether, with the <HI>Janizaries</HI> in the Castle, and other Commanders, demanded of the <HI>Bashaw</HI> the Order of the <HI>Grand Signieur,</HI> which he said, he would not deliver to any but his Master, neither would he shew it. They threatned to take his Head in Compensation for the other; to which with a setled Resolution he neither answered nor resisted. However, he was convey'd out of the Castle, and kept under Guard till the <HI>Grand Signieur</HI> should signifie his Pleasure, either to discharge, or have him sent to him.</P>
<P>The Dominion of the <HI>Bashaw</HI> is limited and bounded by Law; for without the <HI>Kadilescher</HI> or President of the Council, and the Great ones of the Coun∣trey, he cannot conclude any thing of great Concernment; however he
<PB N="139" REF="96"/>takes Cognizance of most things which happen to his Employment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bashaw</HI> in <HI>Cairo</HI> hath the like Officers under him, as are in other <HI>Turkish</HI> Places; that is, a <HI>Tihaia, Cadilesker, Sanjaks, Defterdar, Sarraks, Chiaus, Soubachi;</HI> all which together Constitute the <HI>Divan</HI> or Councel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tihaia</HI> is the second Person next the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> and the <HI>Cadilesker</HI> as much as President of the Councel, or <HI>Divan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sanjaks,</HI> of which the <HI>Bashaw</HI> is Head, are eighteen in number; they take Pay every Monday, and their highest Pay is five and twenty thousand <HI>Medins</HI> a Moneth; besides five and twenty <HI>Ardebes</HI> of Corn, and the like Weight of Barley.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soubachi</HI> is as much as a High-Sheriff of a County.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divan</HI> or Councel assemble at the Castle of <HI>Cairo,</HI> or in the Rooms of an old Structure joyning close to the Castle, thrice a Week, on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays; on Mondays usually Matters of State, and that which concerns Justice are debated; and on Tuesdays touching the Re∣venues.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bashaw</HI> comes into the <HI>Divan</HI> at Noon, accompanied with the <HI>Defterdar,</HI> and four <HI>Sanjaks,</HI> which they call <HI>Nubba;</HI> after the dispatch of business proper for the time, and calling over their Names, they leave the <HI>Bashaw</HI> and the <HI>Def∣terdar</HI> alone with the Secretaries of the <HI>Divan,</HI> which sit at the foot of the <HI>Ba∣shaw:</HI> In this <HI>Divan</HI> also sit the <HI>Rosmanegi, Mocategis, Calfas, Mocabelgies,</HI> and the <HI>Sarraf Bassy,</HI> who commonly is a <HI>Jew,</HI> accompanied also with several other <HI>Sarrafs,</HI> Receivers of the Treasures as well in <HI>Cairo,</HI> as in the plain Countrey in the <HI>Cassifillis</HI> and <HI>Meltescens,</HI> or <HI>Meltecemino</HI> that be Provinces.</P>
<P>The President of the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> who is the <HI>Bashaw</HI>'s Interpreter, is in the <HI>Divan Catteby,</HI> as well as the Secretary, usuall with four <HI>Chiauses,</HI> and as many <HI>Motta∣feragaes,</HI> and a like number of <HI>Janizaries</HI> which stay below.</P>
<P>On Thursdays the inferiour <HI>Divan</HI> assembles, where the <HI>Cadilesker</HI> sits in per∣son, to hear the Complaints of the People, violently oppressed or fleeced by the <HI>Cassifs,</HI> or Governours. But at this day these Courts are seldom kept, yet the people dare not complain.</P>
<P>Concerning the peculiar Businesses of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> they have their own particular <HI>Aga</HI> or President, as also <HI>Spahies</HI> and a <HI>Chiaus;</HI> from which last all the Chief Officers proceed, and are Judges in all Differences which arise among them: from whom however there is an Appeal to the <HI>Divan</HI> of the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> which yet is seldom done. Business of small moment, that reach not Corporal Pu∣nishment, are decided by the <HI>Cadizen</HI> of State; but Corporal Punishments are inflicted by the <HI>Sanjak,</HI> or Superior Authority.</P>
<P>All the Differences among Christians in <HI>Cairo,</HI> or between <HI>Christians, Turks, Moors,</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> are determined by the Consuls of their own Nation, there resident.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sanjaks</HI> of <HI>Cairo</HI> superintend several high and mighty Affairs both with∣in and without the Countrey; that is, one conducts the <HI>Caravan</HI> from <HI>Cairo</HI> to <HI>Mecha;</HI> another guards the <HI>Grand Seigniors</HI> Revenue to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> a third at∣tends the Muster-Master General in the Affairs of the Souldiery, and to per∣fect his Rolls against <HI>Persia, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Mecha.</HI> When they have finisht their Ex∣peditions, they are discharg'd for three years following.</P>
<P>Four other <HI>Sanjaks</HI> usually keep Guard in <HI>Grand Caire</HI> Moneth by Moneth, upon the four great ways of the City: The first is <HI>Alladelne,</HI> or the Gate, out of which they go to <HI>Suhez,</HI> the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and <HI>Palestine:</HI> The second, that over
<PB N="138" REF="97"/>against <HI>Old Caire:</HI> The third leading to the Sepulchres of the Garrison; and the fourth to the second Bridge of <HI>Cally.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the Chief <HI>Bashaw,</HI> there is over every <HI>Cassif</HI> or Dominion, a particu∣lar Governour or Lieutenant, call'd <HI>Sabbessadeh,</HI> appointed by the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> of whom he rents or farms the Province.</P>
<P>Every Governour hath his own peculiar Councel or <HI>Divan</HI> in his Province, to which are belonging one <HI>Chiaus,</HI> one <HI>Droguerman</HI> or Interpreter, one <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and four <HI>Boullouks,</HI> besides <HI>Mottaferagaes, Sphahies, Tuffegies, Sarakgies,</HI> and <HI>Arabgies.</HI></P>
<P>There is also <HI>The Enrollment-Office,</HI> or, <HI>The Divan Catteby,</HI> where all the Orders of the Great <HI>Divan</HI> are entred.</P>
<P>¶ THe Religion of the Antient <HI>Egyptians</HI> consisted in the worshipping of Idols,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Antient Religion or Worship.</NOTE> Beasts and other Creatures, under the several Names of <HI>Osiris</HI> and <HI>Isis, Serapis, Apis, Hammon, Canopus, Horus, Harpocrates, Mithres, Typhon Osiris</HI>'s Brother, and others beside.</P>
<P><HI>Osiris,</HI> according to the Testimony of <HI>Diodorus,</HI> was the Son of <HI>Saturn,</HI> after whose Decease married to <HI>Isis.</HI> They say he govern'd <HI>Egypt</HI> with such Wisdom and Moderation, that he infinitely gained the affections of all: For besides the wholesome Laws he made, he instructed them in Husbandry, Mechanick-Trades, Planting of Vines and Olive-Trees; and was the first among them, that by the help of <HI>Mercury</HI> taught them Letters.</P>
<P>These happy Inventions thus perfected, <HI>Osiris</HI> thirsting after greater Glory, raised a great Army, and commending to <HI>Isis</HI> the Care of all, to whom he joyned as an Assistant for Councel, <HI>Mercury,</HI> a most Ingenious and Politick Statesman;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hercules Egyptian.</NOTE> and Commissioned <HI>Hercules,</HI> a man of extraordinary Strength and Power to overlook the more Active and Military Part. When he had order∣ed all thus wisely, he associated to him his Brother <HI>Apollo,</HI> and his two Sons, <HI>Anuber</HI> and <HI>Macedo;</HI> thus marching into the Field, accompanied also with <HI>Pan, Maro,</HI> and <HI>Triptolemus,</HI> the first Planters of Vineyards, and Sowers of Corn, he passed through <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> atchieving many great Victories, and teaching Civility to all those barbarous conquer'd Nations: At last touching upon <HI>Europe,</HI> much improved by his Travels and Warlike Expeditions, he re∣turned into <HI>Egypt;</HI> where for these great Acts he was Deifi'd by the People, and Worshipped as the Sun, and his Royal Consort <HI>Isis</HI> as the Moon: because as their idolatrous and dull Fancies imagin'd <HI>Osiris</HI> ascended into the Sun, and <HI>Isis</HI> into the Moon, to preside and govern the two great Luminaries, and so consequently the Earth.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Diodorus</HI> relates, That when <HI>Typhon</HI> saw his Brother <HI>Osiris</HI> while alive thus highly reverenc'd, his heart was so imbitter'd against him, that he privately murther'd him by the help of the <HI>Tytanois</HI> distributing to every one of his Relations a part of his Body, and usurped the Kingdom. But <HI>Isis</HI> with the assistance of her Sons <HI>Horus</HI> and <HI>Anubis,</HI> soon reveng'd her Husbands Death, by the destruction of <HI>Typhon,</HI> and all his Rebellious Complices.</P>
<P><HI>Isis</HI> after this in memory of her murther'd Lord, with Herbs and Wax wrought or kneaded with <HI>Aromatick</HI> Spices together, framed a most Exquisite Effigies of him; commanding the Priests to shew it every one, with order that they should in secret honour him as a God, and Consecrate to him what Crea∣ture they liked best: And the more to promote this Service, she settled on them a Yearly Revenue; which prevailing on their covetous minds, they instantly put all in practice, in manner following.</P>
<PB N="141" REF="97"/>
<P>The Priests at the appointed time Went into the <HI>Archives</HI> of the Temple, where stood (but known onely to them) this Image of <HI>Osiris,</HI> before which in mournful postures, amidst their contrite and most doleful lamentations; they first shaved their Heads, then beating their Breasts, and ripping up the Scars and new-heal'd Orifices of their former Wounds received in private as a preparation for this general Service. Some days in this manner being past, they pretend by a most wonderful, and divine Instinct, to have found the Body of <HI>Osiris;</HI> whereupon they run out from Sorrow to the extremity of Exhila∣ration; Tears and Lamentations turn to Songs, Dances, and all sorts of Re∣vels: Which Solemnities finding applause with the ignorant Vulgar, after the first Sanction were continually after Celebrated at the Festival set apart for the finding of <HI>Osiris</HI>'s Body.</P>
<P>There was another Feast, call'd in <HI>Greek, Phallophoria,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Feast <HI>Phallophoria.</HI></NOTE> kept in Comme∣moration of the finding his <HI>Genitals;</HI> for <HI>Typhon</HI> had, as we said, distributed the rest; which <HI>Diodorus</HI> says was publickly presented in Ivory or Gold, half a yard in length, carried about with Wind-Musick, and in dancing before it pre∣sented all wanton and obscene posture. <HI>Isis</HI> also had a Holiday, wherein they did nothing but bemoan <HI>Osiris</HI> Death. At all these Feasts, the Priests wore a long white Linnen Surplice, they wore upon their Head the Image of <HI>Anu∣bis,</HI> headed like a Dog, in their Right Hand a Branch of Sea-Wormwood, or Pine; in the Left, a Tree that had power (as they gave out) to drive away Evil Spirits. <HI>Osiris,</HI> according to <HI>Plutarch,</HI> draws the <HI>Etymology</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> Word <HI>Hosieros,</HI> or <HI>Hosiros,</HI> that is, <HI>Very Holy;</HI> or of two <HI>Egyptian</HI> Words, <HI>Os</HI> and <HI>Iris;</HI> the first signifying <HI>Great</HI> or <HI>Immense;</HI> and the last an <HI>Eye;</HI> as much as to say, as <HI>Great Eye. Kircher</HI> will have it, that <HI>Osiris</HI> in the Antient <HI>Egyptian Tongue</HI> signifies <HI>Holy Lord,</HI> and a <HI>Ubiquitary Fire.</HI> If then <HI>Osiris</HI> genuinely denotes a <HI>Shi∣ning Light,</HI> or an <HI>Immense Eye,</HI> it must needs be meant of the Sun; because Phi∣losophers held the Sun to be a Fire. And we not scruple to denominate it <HI>Great Eye,</HI> viewing still at once the half of our <HI>Orb.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Isis, Osyris</HI>'s Wife was also taken for the Moon; both these were said, ac∣cording to <HI>Diodorus,</HI> to compass the World, and to feed and multiply all things, by a continual Circulation. These are peculiarly operative in all Pro∣pagations; the one being Fiery and full of Spirit, the other Moist and Cold; the Air which is the Nurse, participating of both.</P>
<P>The Powers and Perfections of <HI>Osiris,</HI> or the Sun, are expressed by so many Names, that <HI>Plutarch</HI> not without good cause calleth it <HI>Myrionumos;</HI> that is, <HI>Thousand Names. Homer</HI> names <HI>Osiris</HI> and <HI>Isis,</HI> for the same cause, <HI>Father and Mother of all the Gods:</HI> And indeed from hence have sprung an infinite number; some confounding <HI>Osiris</HI> with <HI>Bacchus</HI> or <HI>Dionysius, Mercury, Pan, Neptune, Jupiter, Ja∣nus, Saturn,</HI> and <HI>Coelum;</HI> others make him one and the same with <HI>Hercules, Apol∣lo, Pluto, Horus;</HI> some, as <HI>Hesychius,</HI> will have him the same with <HI>Nilus, Apis, Serapis, Hammon,</HI> and <HI>Oceanus.</HI> See here a Pedigree of all the Gods proceeding from one Stock or Root.</P>
<P>Writers infinitely differ about this <HI>Isis:</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> make her the Daughter of <HI>Inachus,</HI> whence the handsome Fiction of the Transformation of <HI>Isis</HI> by <HI>Juno</HI> into a Cow, springs; but this <HI>Isis,</HI> or rather <HI>Io,</HI> was not the Wife of <HI>Osiris,</HI> but the <HI>Assyrian Isis.</HI> Some derive her from <HI>Ethiopia: Xenophon, Diodorus, Euse∣bius,</HI> and others, make <HI>Osiris</HI> and <HI>Isis</HI> Children of <HI>Saturn,</HI> which some again con∣tradict.</P>
<PB N="142" REF="98"/>
<P><HI>Isis</HI> was among the <HI>Egyptians</HI> held in such great Honour, that it was a Capi∣tal Crime to say, <HI>She was a Man;</HI> therefore in all Temples where the Images of <HI>Osiris</HI> and <HI>Isis</HI> were set, stood also one of <HI>Horus</HI> or <HI>Harpocrates, Osiris</HI>'s Son, with his finger upon his Lips, importing silence. She was held by general consent of most Antient Writers, to be the Moon; and therefore by <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Greek</HI> is call'd <HI>Pandeches,</HI> that is, <HI>Receiver General;</HI> and <HI>Keratophorus,</HI> or <HI>Cornuted, Servius</HI> saith, <HI>Isis</HI> signifies <HI>the Spirit of Nilus:</HI> The moving of the Trees, which she was feign'd to carry in her right Hand, signifi'd the flowing up of <HI>Nilus;</HI> and the <HI>Merlin</HI> in her left Hand, the flowing to the <HI>Banks:</HI> From whence, we may not without Reason infer, That in the <HI>Egyptian Tongue</HI> it signifies <HI>the Earth.</HI> By <HI>Apuleius</HI> in his Eleventh Book of his <HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> she is stiled, <HI>The generating Nature of all things, Lady of all principal Matters, Bringer forth of Ages, the Supream of the Deities, Queen of Spirits, the first Exemplar of Gods and Goddesses.</HI> Adding, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> call'd her the <HI>Cecropian Minerva;</HI> the <HI>Cyprians,</HI> the <HI>Paphian Venus;</HI> the <HI>Cret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ans,</HI> the <HI>Dictimnian Diana;</HI> the <HI>Sicylians,</HI> the <HI>Stigian Proserpina;</HI> the <HI>Eleusinians,</HI> the an∣tient <HI>Ceres,</HI> others <HI>Juno,</HI> some <HI>Bellona, Hecate, Rhramussia;</HI> only the <HI>Egyptians</HI> call'd her by her right Name, <HI>Isis.</HI> So many and several Names had <HI>Isis,</HI> for no other Cause, but to signifie the different operations which she affected in the World. <HI>Diodorus</HI> affirms, that <HI>Isis</HI> found out many Medicinal Remedies for the expelling of Diseases:

<P>Memorials of <HI>Osiris.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MY Father is</HI> Saturn, <HI>the Youngest of all the Gods; I am King</HI> Osiris, <HI>who have tra∣vell'd through the whole World, even to the uninhabited Borders and Bounds of</HI> India, <HI>and other Parts of the Kingdoms of the Earth, to the utmost Ocean. I am the Eldest Son of</HI> Saturn, <HI>a Branch of a Noble and Excellent Father. There is no Place in the World which I have not Visited, teaching every where those rarities which I have found out.</HI></P>
<P>They say at last, That <HI>Isis,</HI> besides the Inventing the sowing of Wheat, Bar∣ley, and other Grain, instituted Laws also; wherefore she was call'd by the Antients,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch.</NOTE> <HI>The Law-giver,</HI> which confirms the words of the former produced Inscription. She was also by the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd <HI>Tithenes,</HI> that is, <HI>Nurse;</HI> and <HI>Pan∣deches,</HI> that is, as we said already, <HI>Receiver General,</HI> and held to be the same with <HI>Proserpine</HI> and <HI>Ceres,</HI> and so the Mother of the Gods, because she bears the Titles attributed to all.</P>
<P>We have heretofore spoken of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> ridiculous Superstition and Ido∣latry, we will now add something of their <HI>Apis,</HI> and so come to their present Perswasion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> worshipped with great Zeal and Devotion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Apis</HI> or <HI>Epaphus.</HI></NOTE> a Calf or Ox, which they call'd <HI>Apis,</HI> and the <HI>Greeks, Epaphus;</HI> for every Ox was not fit for it,
<PB N="143" REF="98"/>but it must be Black all over the Body, having a square White Spot or Star on the Fore-head, the shape of an Eagle upon the Back, a Py'd Tail, and upon the Tongue a Horse-flye or Hornet.</P>
<P>When such an Ox dy'd, the People fell into sorrow upon it, and sumptu∣ously Bury'd it, never ceasing their grief till the Priests found out another like the former; in which Quest proving successful, the Priests brought the Calf first into the City <HI>Nilus,</HI> where they fed it Forty days, afterwards in a Ship, under a Golden Pavilion, to <HI>Memphis,</HI> where they plac'd it in the Temple of <HI>Vul∣can.</HI> The cause hereof, says <HI>Diodorus,</HI> was because they believ'd the soul of <HI>Osiris</HI> first of all transmigrated into it.</P>
<P>Nor did this <HI>Apian</HI> Worship terminate it self in <HI>Egypt,</HI> but also spread into the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where even to this day, in the Kingdom of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> in <HI>Bengala, Sumatra,</HI> upon the <HI>Maldiver Islands,</HI> and other Countreys lying on the Sea-Coast, are to be seen such <HI>Apises</HI> or Oxen; nay, they are come to such a height of Sottishness, that they believe none that die shall be sav'd, unless at their Departure they lay their Hand upon the Tail of any Ox or Cow.</P>
<P>¶ AS to the present Religion in <HI>Egypt,</HI> it is <HI>Mahumetan:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The present Worship in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> And <HI>Bellonius</HI> in his Observations, says, The <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> do keep their Law much more stricter than the <HI>Turks;</HI> and although that have prevailed most, yet in <HI>Cairo</HI> it self, are many Christians, of several Nations and Sects, <HI>viz. English, Dutch, French, Italians, Copticks, Nestorians, Maronites, Georgians, Jacobites, Arme∣nians, Syrians,</HI> and others, amounting to the Number of 100000. All which, though in some Points differing among themselves, yet in many of their Church-Ceremonies they agree with the <HI>Roman,</HI> though in others they have remarkable Differences: They inhabit several Cities, Villages, Hamlets and Cloisters beside <HI>Cairo,</HI> as at <HI>Alexandria, Sai, Tmui, Asna, Festadada, Coptus, Asman, Asioch, Elesmunin, Monphaluth, Caus,</HI> and in the Cloisters of St. <HI>Macharius,</HI> St. <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI> St. <HI>Hermes,</HI> and St. <HI>Pachomius,</HI> adjacent to the Red-Sea.</P>
<P>All these Christians, and the <HI>Abyssines</HI> themselves, are under one Patriarch, who keeps his Residence in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and in the <HI>Arabick</HI> is call'd <HI>Papa,</HI> or <HI>Abu∣ma Patriarch,</HI> that is, Our Father Patriarch.</P>
<P>In former times, under the Persecution of the Emperor <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> the <HI>Copticks</HI> did lead an Honest and Sincere Life, adhering to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but af∣terwards rent from it, by the embracing the destructive Heresies of <HI>Dioscorus</HI> and <HI>Eutiches;</HI> and at present own no other Head of the Church than the <HI>Alex∣andrian Patriarch.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jacobites</HI> hold, that in Christ, by the Hypostatical Union,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kircher suppl. Copt. c.</HI> 2.</NOTE> is one only Per∣sonal Nature, consisting of two Natures not Personal, without Mixture grow∣ing together. They make Saints of <HI>Dioscorus, Severus, Petrus, Macharius,</HI> all He∣reticks, and condemn <HI>Pope Leo.</HI> They hold also, that themselves, together with the <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Abyssines,</HI> are the Universal or Catholick Church, and exclude all others, and withal, that before the General Judgment, no man goes into Paradise or into Hell.</P>
<P>Those that follow the Heresie of <HI>Dioscorus,</HI> from <HI>Arrius</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kircher.</NOTE> deny Christ's Humanity, affirming his Body coequal with the Deity; others deny that he received a Soul, and from these words of St. <HI>John, And the Word became Flesh;</HI> that he took Flesh of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and that meerly the Word became Flesh.</P>
<P>Those lastly, that follow <HI>Nestorius,</HI> a <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Bishop,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kircher.</NOTE> distinguish
<PB N="144" REF="99"/>two Substances or Beings in Christ, giving him two Persons, and by Conse∣quence two Sons of God, and two Christs; one which is God, and the other generated of his Mother <HI>Mary.</HI> They say that the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> is not to be call'd <HI>Gods Mother,</HI> but <HI>Christs Mother.</HI></P>
<P>In their Divine Service, the <HI>Copticks</HI> use the Liturgies of St. <HI>Peter, Mark, Basil, Gregory, Cyril,</HI> translated into the <HI>Coptick,</HI> they also Celebrate it in <HI>Arabick,</HI> which there every one understands; but the Epistles and Gospels are read twice, once in the <HI>Coptick,</HI> and once in the <HI>Arabick;</HI> In the same manner as in a Solemn Service at <HI>Rome,</HI> they are read both in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine.</HI> At the time of the Service, they all leaning against the Pillars, thereby to shew, that they are Travellers or Pilgrims, and expect the blessed coming of the Glory of the Great God. They sing aloud altogether their Liturgies, in a Tone call'd in <HI>Arabick, Hink;</HI> sometimes raising their Notes to the <HI>Alts,</HI> then using deep <HI>Cadences,</HI> so well ordered, that no un∣pleasing Discord jarr from their Harmony.</P>
<P>Now although most of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Patriarchs or Pastors, together with their Flocks have formerly thus departed from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet all the Coun∣treys of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the whole <HI>Abyssine Church,</HI> have, and still do acknowledg the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI> Doctrine to be the right, and the Pope to be Christs Vicar; as appears by several Letters from <HI>Gabriel</HI> the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> sent by two Messengers to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the Eighth, in the Year Fifteen hundred ninety and three; wherein he calleth himself <HI>GABRIEL, The humble Minister by Gods Grace, of St.</HI> Mark, <HI>in the City of</HI> Alexandria, <HI>and in all other, bordering Southerly on the Sea-coast, and among the Abyssines.</HI> In one of these his Messages he made Confession of his Belief before the Pope, in these words: <HI>I believe and confess that the holy</HI> Apostolick Seat, <HI>and the</HI> Roman Pope, <HI>is the supream Head in the whole Church, and the Successor of the blessed Apostle St.</HI> Peter, <HI>Prince of the Apostles, and Christs Vicar, and Father and Teacher of all Christians: I confess that Power is given to him from our Lord Christ, through St.</HI> Peter, <HI>to keep and govern the Universal Church, as al∣so that none can be Saved out of that Universal Church.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Confession, which they stand to at this day. The Pope is by these Patriarchs, in their Letters to Him, commonly thus Entituled:</P>
<P><HI>To the Greatly Esteemed</HI> Pope, <HI>Father of the Priesthood, Successor in the Universal, Apostolick, truly Believing Church, Father and Prince of Princes, Christs Vicegerent on Earth, Sitting upon the Seat of St.</HI> Peter, <HI>Prince of the Apostles, Lord</HI> Urban <HI>the Eighth.</HI></P>
<P>After the Death of one Patriarch, another is chosen out of the number of Monks, residing in the Cloisters.</P>
<P>And here observe, That ever since the Beginning of Christianity, there were three Patriarchs, by the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> Erected in the most Famous Cities of the <HI>Roman Empire;</HI> The <HI>Roman,</HI> the <HI>Alexandrian,</HI> and the <HI>Antiochian;</HI> where∣to afterwards was added the <HI>Constantinopolitan,</HI> by the Councils of <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Chalcedon:</HI> And lastly, the <HI>Jerusalemitan,</HI> by the same Council of <HI>Chalcedon.</HI></P>
<P>The Sixth Canon of the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> held in the Year after the Birth of Christ, Three hundred twenty and five, annexed to the Patriarch of <HI>Alexan∣dria, Egypt, Lybia,</HI> or <HI>Pentapolis, Arcadia</HI> and <HI>Augustanica;</HI> to which afterward were added Upper and lower <HI>Egypt,</HI> both <HI>Thebes,</HI> and other, so that at last <HI>Egypt</HI> con∣tain'd ten Arch-Bishopricks: For so many Metropolitans it pleased the Emperor <HI>Theodosius</HI> and <HI>Valentinius</HI> to call together out of this Patriarchat, in a Letter to <HI>Dioscorus.</HI> And indeed so far hath this of <HI>Alexandria</HI> extended it self of late, that now it includes the utmost Bounds of the <HI>Abyssines.</HI></P>
<PB N="145" REF="99"/>
<P>There are in <HI>Egypt</HI> likewise many <HI>Calogers,</HI> that is, shaved Monks, which follow the <HI>Greek Religion,</HI> and possess many Churches and Cloisters. All which live poorly, sleep upon the Ground, and drink no Wine, but meerly so much as is necessary for the Mass.</P>

<P>¶ THe Customs of these People are according to their Names,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every man marries ma∣ny Wives.</NOTE> <HI>Barbarous:</HI> For every man takes as many Wives as he pleases, keeping besides Con∣cubines and Slaves in great number. They esteem the Children of one Woman no more than the other; all after the Fathers Decease joyntly participating of the Inheritance.</P>
<P>In their Marrying they use no other Solemnity, than a bare Testimony and Assurance, which the Bridegroom makes before the <HI>Cadi</HI> or Judge; whereby he acknowledges to take such a
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As we had in the late Troubles, Marriages before a Justice.</NOTE> Woman or Maid for his Bride: but this is of so little validity, that he may put her away when he will: Neither hath the Woman a less Priviledge, having liberty at her pleasure to renegue her Hus∣band, onely with this difference: If the Wife go from her Husband, yet the Father is bound to pay him the Marrige-Portion promised: But if the Man puts away his Wife, he can demand nothing, except he have testimony against her for Adultery. The Women and Maids keep themselves so vail'd, that they are not, nor must be seen by such as would make Love to Marry them.</P>
<P>In like manner the Men are so Jealous of their Wives, that they dare not go open-fac'd to their Parents.</P>
<P>They have many pernicious Customs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evil Customs.</NOTE> being greatly addicted to Sorcery and Witchcraft: Whoever at any time falls sick, makes an address to a Wise∣man or Wise-woman, as we term them, who oftentimes cure them by Charms taken out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> or <HI>Amulets,</HI> or else Specifick Medicines, for they have neither Physician, Apothecaries, or other Druggists, but onely some inexpert Chyrurgeons.</P>
<P>The greatest Zealots amongst them, when sick, go where one of their <HI>Mara∣bouts,</HI> or <HI>Saints</HI> lie buried; to whose Sepulchre they bring a great many things to eat, fondly fancied to a belief, that if by chance a Beast eat thereof, it gets the Disease, and the sick person will recover.</P>
<P>When their women are in Labor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Superstition of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> when they bring forth.</NOTE> they send to School to fetch five little children, whereof four are employ'd to hold the corners of a Cloth, in each whereof they tie a Hens Egg: wherewith these Children presently run along the Streets, and sing certain Prayers, one answering the other. In the mean while the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> come out of their Houses with Bottles or Cruises full of Water, which they throw into the midst of the Cloth; by which means they believe the Woman who is in Labour is luckily deliver'd.</P>
<P>To this idle Fancy they adde another no less ridiculous, to cure the Pain in the Head; by taking a Lamb or young Kid, which they hunt and beat about the Field so long, till it fall down, whereby they perswade themselves, that the pain will pass out of the mans head into the beasts.</P>
<P>To countervail these bad and foolish,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two commendable Cu∣stoms.</NOTE> they have some commendable Cu∣stoms:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pierre Dan. descript. Bar∣bar.</NOTE> One is, That how angry soever they are, they never swear by the Name of God; nor have in their Language, whether <HI>Arabick, Turkish,</HI> or <HI>Mo∣risk,</HI> any particular words wherewith they can curse or blaspheme. 'Tis true, the <HI>Renagadoes</HI> Swear desperately in their own Tongues; but because they do it in contradiction of the <HI>Turks,</HI> they are presently most severely punished for it: The second is, That how great a contest soever they have one against an∣other, they seldom come to Hand-blows, but never kill.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Barbary</HI> are very ingenious,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Condition of the In∣habitants in Cities.</NOTE> and singularly zealous in their Religion; but no people more jealous: for they had rather lose their lives, than have a blemish on their Reputation; which especially
<PB N="149" REF="102"/>they look upon, as best preserved by their Wives Chastity. They covet Riches above measure, but are very modest in speech. The Inferiours behave them∣selves towards their Superiours with great humility and submission: But Chil∣dren shew wonderful Reverence and Obedience towards their Parents.</P>
<P>The Countrey People dwell in Tents or Booths upon the Hills and Fields,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the Coun∣trey People.</NOTE> generally dealing in Cattel; they are not fierce of Nature, yet very couragi∣ous; they live but poorly, yet are great pains-takers, and liberal.</P>
<P>Whereas the Townsmen on the other side, are quarrelsome, vindicative, in∣hospitable, covetous, setting their whole thoughts upon scraping together Money and Goods. They are continual Traders, but so suspicious, that they will not trust any Foreigner: They are great boasters, but dull of wit, gi∣ving easie belief to common reports, and doubtful hear-says, yet so cunning and false in their dealing, that they will deceive the most vigilant.</P>
<P>Some of the better Sort have great inclination to Arts and Sciences,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are inclin'd to Skil and Knowledge.</NOTE> delight∣ing chiefly in Histories, and the Exposition of their Law. Heretofore extraor∣dinarily addicted to Southsaying, Magick, and Astrology; all which about five hundred years since were absolutely forbidden by their Princes.</P>
<P>They Ride well after their manner, and know with a singular dexterity to mount and dismount: The chiefest Weapons of such as dwell up in the Coun∣trey, are long Launces or Javelins, in the throwing of which they are won∣derful ready: but all that coast upon the Sea, use Guns, Powder, and Shot.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey is very healthful,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Age of the People in <HI>Barbary.</HI></NOTE> so that the people by the ordinary course of Nature, seldom dye before sixty five, or seventy years of Age: In the Mountains peradventure some be found reaching a hundred years, remain∣ing to the last very strong and active; but chiefly upon the Sea-Coasts where the Air is constantly refresht and agitated, by the frequency of cool Breezes, which have the same efficacy, working upon their Constitutions, so that they are seldom sickly.</P>
<P><HI>Barbary</HI> hath a great abundance of Merchandise,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barbary</HI> affords much Mer∣chandise,</NOTE> which are transported by Foreigners to the enriching of the Inhabitants; such are untann'd or raw Hides, Linnen, and Cotton-Cloth, Raisins, Dates, Figs, and the like; of which we will speak more particularly in its proper place.</P>
<P>Evident Signs of the great Wealth of this Kingdom in former times may be drawn hence, that the Kings of <HI>Fez,</HI> as they say,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signs of the Antient Pow∣er of <HI>Barbary.</HI></NOTE> formerly spent four hundred and eighty thousand Crowns in the building a Colledge,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leo Africk. Peter Aviley Barbary.</NOTE> and seven thousand in erecting a Castle, and little less in founding a City, besides his continual standing Pay to his Militia. No less are the Riches thereof at this day,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signs of the present Power</NOTE> as ap∣pears by the great Revenue of the Kings of <HI>Morocco</HI> and <HI>Fez,</HI> the <HI>Bashaws</HI> and other great Lords of <HI>Tripolis, Algiers,</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> and the infinite Trade and Merchandise, which the <HI>English, Venetians, Genoas, Hollanders, French, Hambur∣gers,</HI> and other people, drive there, without taking notice of the rich Spoils the Pyrates of <HI>Barbary</HI> carry in from all parts, especially <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> with too much connivance of their Governours, though seemingly against their Command.</P>
<P>Another signal proof of its exceeding Wealthiness, are the great number of <HI>Mosques,</HI> and the yearly Revenues belonging to them. For in <HI>Algiers</HI> onely there are a hundred, and in <HI>Tunis</HI> three hundred, as many also in <HI>Fez,</HI> and in <HI>Morocco</HI> seven hundred, among which the chief have two hundred Ducats An∣nual Rent. Adde thereto, that the Plunder of <HI>Fez,</HI> when those of <HI>Algiers</HI> be∣came Masters of it, was valued at two hundred and sixty Millions; and the
<PB N="150" REF="103"/>Spoyl of <HI>Tunis,</HI> under the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, which he gave to the Soldiers for a Reward, as much, when the three chiefest Field-Officers gave each of them for their Heads, Thirty Millions of coyned Ducats. Moreover, the <HI>Jews,</HI> who have their chiefest Refuge there, as in the Center of the World, bring no small advantage by the liberty of their Usury.</P>
<P>The Dominion of <HI>Barbary</HI> is various as the Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Government of <HI>Bar∣bary.</HI></NOTE> some are absolute un∣limited Kings, as those of <HI>Morocco</HI> and <HI>Fez.</HI> Others acknowledge a Superior Lord, as the Kings of <HI>Algiers, Tunis</HI> and <HI>Tripolis,</HI> who are no other than <HI>Bashaws</HI> or <HI>Viceroys,</HI> or under the obedience of the <HI>Great Turk,</HI> who at his Pleasure may alter the <HI>Bashaw:</HI> Another sort, though Tributaries, yet Rule with absolute Soveraignty, as the Kings of <HI>Konkue</HI> and <HI>Labez,</HI> as also the <HI>Xeques</HI> of the <HI>Ara∣bians;</HI> in the whole Countrey there is but one Common-wealth, and that too may rather be termed an Anarchy than a Republick.</P>
<P>In every City where the <HI>Grand Signieur</HI> hath a <HI>Bashaw</HI> Resident,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In every City is a <HI>Cady.</HI></NOTE> a <HI>Cady</HI> is sent to administer Justice, who with unlimited power Judges and Determines all Civil and Criminal Causes. Every one there pleads his own Case without Proctor, Advocate, or Councel, which course is observed through all <HI>Bar∣bary,</HI> except at <HI>Salle,</HI> where the <HI>Moors</HI> who are Masters there, plead with Proctors and Advocates after the <HI>Spanish</HI> way.</P>
<P>The People here are,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many sorts of People in <HI>Barbary</HI> of several Reli∣gions.</NOTE> as elsewhere, of different Religions, as <HI>Mahumetans, Christians, Jews,</HI> and the Countrey People, who are never congregated or make any shews of Devotion.</P>
<P>In their <HI>Mosques</HI> they have no Images,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mosques</HI> or Temples of the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI></NOTE> but in stead of them, Six hundred Lamps sometimes in a Row; about it stands a great Cloister or Hermitage, wherein the <HI>Iman</HI> or <HI>Marabou,</HI> that is, the Priest dwells. Their Prayers are call'd <HI>Sala,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they pray in them.</NOTE> and the People repeat the same words the Priest, says before them, and in all Gestures imitate him, in several lifting up of their Hands and Heads to Hea∣ven. At their entrance into the <HI>Mosques,</HI> they put off their Shooes, kiss the Earth, and wash their Mouths, Noses, Ears, the soals of their Feet, and Secret Parts, whereby they believe that the Pollutions of the Soul are purifi'd and clens'd. And during their abode there, they neither dare to Spit or Cough, nor so much as speak one to another, but upon great Necessity; They sit down there upon the Floor one by another, upon Matts of Date or Palm-Trees. The Women are not permitted to come thither, lest by their sight the Men should fall into unclean Thoughts; but they commonly perform their Devotions at Home.</P>
<P>They go to their <HI>Sala</HI> five Times a Day,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They perform their Pray∣ers five times a Day.</NOTE> that is, at Day-break, which they call <HI>Caban;</HI> at Noon, call'd <HI>Dohor;</HI> in the Afternoon at four, call'd <HI>Lazar;</HI> at six or seven, which they call <HI>Magarepe,</HI> and at two in the Night, <HI>Latumar;</HI> but few resort at all these Times, but the most Zealous, none being compell'd to it. They have neither Bells, Clocks or Dials. And when they call the People to their Devotions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How People are called to Prayers.</NOTE> certain Officers to that purpose only appointed, go up to the Battlements of an high Steeple, and upon a Wooden Pole set up a small Flag; but this is used no where but in <HI>Barbary.</HI> When this is done, then the <HI>Marabou</HI> turns himself to the South, because <HI>Mecha</HI> lyeth that way; then stopping his Fingers in his Ears, he cryes out these words with a loud Voice, <HI>Lahilla Lah,</HI> Mahometh <HI>ressoul Allah;</HI> that is, <HI>God is God, and</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet.</HI> Then he turns him to other Parts, saying the same words. By this setting up of the Flag, and Out-cryes, the People know what hour of the Night it is. When the <HI>Marabou</HI> of the greatest <HI>Mosque</HI> hath call'd, then all the other follow, which they act with Ridiculous and wilde Gestures.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="103"/>
<P>The <HI>Friday</HI> is their Sabbath, call'd by them <HI>Dimanche,</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Feast <HI>Ramadan.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Every Year they keep a Feast, which they call <HI>Ramadan,</HI> which continues a whole Moneth; during which they abstain, from Morning to the close of the Evening, from Eating and Drinking; but then the <HI>Marabou</HI> going to the Stee∣ple, gives them by his accustom'd Cryings, leave to Eat. This their Fasting, is so highly esteemed, that they dare not so much as drink Tobacco, supposing that to be a Breach: Nay, the very <HI>Corsaires</HI> or Pyrates observe the <HI>Ramadan</HI> at Sea; and though the <HI>Renagadoes</HI> do not so strictly bind themselves to it, yet they for neglect of it, are, if known, punished with an hundred or two stroaks on the bottoms of their Feet.</P>
<P>After this Fast, and long <HI>Lent</HI> so well kept, they celebrate their Passeover,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Passeover, <HI>Easter</HI> or <HI>Bayran.</HI></NOTE> call'd by them <HI>Bayran,</HI> which continues three Days, wherein they distribute Alms plentifully, and frequent their <HI>Mosques</HI> with great Fervency and Zeal.</P>
<P>The Priests in <HI>Barbary</HI> are of two Sorts, <HI>Santons</HI> and <HI>Marabouts,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Clergy or Sacred in <HI>Barbary</HI> are of two sorts.</NOTE> whereof the chiefest is call'd <HI>Moufti,</HI> who hath his Residence in Cities, and hears and deter∣mines all Ecclesiastical Causes. The <HI>Marabouts</HI> are in great number about the <HI>Mosques,</HI> as well in Cities and Suburbs, as in the open Fields, where they live as Recluses or Hermits, in Cells, to which these <HI>Barbarians</HI> bear so great an Esteem and Reverence, that they flye to them as to Sanctuaries, how great a Crime soever they have committed.</P>
<P>Among these Devotees, there are some, who lead a strange and unusual Life,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Gestures.</NOTE> for sometime Melancholy so working on their Imagination, that no less than if Distracted, they rove through the Cities bare-foot and bare-leg'd, in a rag∣ged Coat and a Staff, with which they tap or gently strike, here one, there another, which favour whoever receives, accounts himself happy, perswaded thereby their Sins are remitted. Besides also, these Recluses study Magick and such forbidden Arts, undertaking to cure all Diseases, and to work Love, by several Incantations, and the power of Numbers: Of the great opinion the An∣tients had of Charms and Numbers, hear <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>

<P>In the City of <HI>Algier,</HI> and in other Cities in <HI>Barbary,</HI> are several small <HI>Mosques,</HI> where many of these <HI>Marabouts</HI> lye buried, whom they honor as Saints or Sa∣cred, or set before their Sepulchers burning Lamps, going thither on Pilgri∣mage, or when they are sick, send Presents to obtain Remedy.</P>
<P>Those that are afflicted with the Falling-sickness are held in great Esteem,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Falling-sickness in Esteem among them.</NOTE> because <HI>Mahomet</HI> was troubled with this Disease, and shamelesly made them
<PB N="152" REF="104"/>believe, That then God by his Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> reveal'd to him the most secret Mysteries of his Religion.</P>
<P>The highest Festival is the Nativity of their great Prophet,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Festival upon the Birth of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> which they celebrate with all Solemnity, the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> in manner fol∣lowing: All the School-masters assemble after Dinner with their Scholars in the chiefest <HI>Mosque,</HI> out of which they go in Order, every one with a Torch in his Hand, and sing along the Streets the Eulogy and famous Acts and Praise of their Prophet. Two of these Masters carry upon their shoulders a great Pyra∣mide, cover'd over with Flower-Works, and a Cross on the top of it, follow'd by vocal and instrumental Musick, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner; all the Corner-Houses in Cross-ways are hang'd with Tapistry and burning Lamps. They set also in every House, about Mid-night, a lighted Torch upon the Table, be∣cause <HI>Mahomet</HI> was born at that Hour. During the eight Days of this Feast, every one may walk the Streets by Night, which at other times they dare not, on pain of corporal Punishment.</P>
<P>The Cooks of the <HI>Divan,</HI> to the number of Two hundred, each carrying a Napkin or Towel upon his shoulders, and a burning Torch in his Hand, from the seventh to the eleventh Hour, go two and two along the Streets, till pla∣cing themselves before the doors of the chiefest Councellors, they chant a solemn and appointed Hymn, in Praise of their Prophet, with many Instruments of Musick.</P>
<P>¶ THe last Solemnity concerns their Burials or Funerals,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Solemnity for the Dead.</NOTE> which they per∣form in this manner: When any Dies, the next Friend hireth Women to lament, who flocking about the Corps, with strange and unusual howling make a noise, and scratch themselves till the blood follow their Nails. This done,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they bury their Dead.</NOTE> the Body is inclosed in a Coffin, cover'd with a Green Cloth, upon which a Turban is set, as we use a Garland, and so with the Head forward, is carried to and laid in the Grave, but attended all the way thither with howl∣ing Valedictions. At the entrance of the Burial-place some <HI>Marabouts</HI> sing without intermission these words, <HI>Lahilla Lah,</HI> Mahometh <HI>ressoul allah,</HI> that is, <HI>God is God, and</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet.</HI> At last it is placed in the Grave in a sitting Posture, with a Stone under the Head, in stead of a Pillow, and the Face towards the South.</P>
<P>Their Burying-places are very Large, and lye round about the Cities, for they Interr none in their <HI>Mosques,</HI> but in the plain Field, where every one accord∣ing to his Estate buys a spot of Ground, which they Wall in, and plant with Flowers. The Women every <HI>Friday</HI> visit these Monuments, carrying thither Meat and Fruits, which they leave for the Poor, and for the Fowls, after they have tasted of them, believing it to be a work of Charity, and a furtherance to the bliss of departed Souls. They pray there for their Husbands and other De∣ceased Friends, and comfort them sometimes with these or the like words; <HI>That they should have Patience in waiting for the Resurrection of their Bodies.</HI> And this shall suffice to have spoken of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Barbary</HI> differ in nothing from the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great number of <HI>Jews Barbary.</HI></NOTE> being so numerous, that only in the Cities of <HI>Morocco, Algier</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> and a part of the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> there are a Hundred thousand Families.</P>
<P>The Christians are few, and not Masters of many places in <HI>Barbary;</HI> those that be, are under the Command of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as <HI>Arache, Oran, Mamaure,</HI> and <HI>Tangier,</HI> now in the possession of the King of <HI>England. Gramay</HI> saith, that in
<PB N="153" REF="104"/><HI>Morocco, Fez;</HI> also in <HI>Lybia</HI> are some Remainders of Antient Christians, who Celebrate the Liturgy of the <HI>Mozarabes</HI> or <HI>Moxarabes,</HI> Translated out of the <HI>Latine</HI> into the <HI>Greek Tongue,</HI> and about an Hundred and seventy <HI>Greek Families,</HI> who give peculiar Honor to St. <HI>Stephen.</HI></P>
<P>There are besides these many other of several Nations, who taken at Sea by the Pyrates, are brought to Land and sold for Slaves, whence they cannot be redeem'd without great Ransoms, except by chance any make an Escape, which is seldom; or rowing in the Galleys be retaken by the Christians. These gene∣rally lead a miserable Life, undergoing the extremity of Servitude; only some one by good Fortune, that lights upon a milde Patron, is more gently handled.</P>
<P>In <HI>Algier</HI> the Slavery is most bitter; but in the Kindoms of <HI>Tripolis, Tunis</HI> and <HI>Fez,</HI> more tollerable.</P>
<P>Some Slaves meet with Patrons dwelling up in the Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The labour of the Slaves in <HI>Barlary.</HI></NOTE> which carry them thither to bear all sorts of Burdens to Market, of which if they render not a good account, they are sure to be well beaten. Others go Naked, as in <HI>Bil∣ledulgerid,</HI> tending Cattel, or like Horses drawing the Plough without any other reward for their toyl, than harsh Language and merciless Blows, being hardly afforded a little Water and Meal for Food. Others are thrust into the Galleys to row, where their best fare is Water and hard Bisket, and the reward of their Pains, drubs with a Bulls pizzle; nor is their treatment better when they come ashore, being lockt to a heavy Chain, and at night thrust into Dungeons, by them call'd <HI>Masmora,</HI> where they lye upon the bare ground.</P>
<P>Such as chance to have City Patrons,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The labour of the Slaves in the Cities.</NOTE> their chiefest labour is to carry Wa∣ter from place to place, bear away the dust of their Houses, convey their Mer∣chandises to Ware-Houses, work in the Mill like Horses, knead their Dough, bake their Bread, and do all other drudgery, yet for all receive neither good word or deed, or freedom from their Fetters.</P>
<P>Many of these wretched Creatures,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why many Christian Slaves make desection.</NOTE> partly out of desperation and impati∣ence of their misery, partly out of a desire of liberty, and hopes to attain the honour of a <HI>Janizary,</HI> renounce their Religion and turn <HI>Turks:</HI> Nay, there are many rich Women, who often give half their Goods to their Slaves, when they embrace <HI>Mahumetanism;</HI> and some even of the best Quality among them being Widows, are so zealous, that they marry their Slaves, out of design only to draw them to be <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> it being among the <HI>Turks</HI> accounted a most meritorious work to make Proselytes to their Prophet. The several Punishments for Ma∣lefactors in use by them are these.</P>
<P>Those that can be prov'd after Circumcision to revolt,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Punishments.</NOTE> are stript quite na∣ked, then anointed with Tallow, and with a Chain about his Body, brought to the place of Execution, where they are burnt.</P>
<P>They who are convicted of any Conspiracy or Treason, have a sharp Spit thrust up the Fundament, others bound Hand and Foot, and cast from a high Wall or Tower, upon an Iron Hook, whereon sometimes they stick fast by the Belly, sometimes by the Head or other parts of the Body, sometimes only by the Skin, and hanging many days, they so languishing in great torture, die; or else ty'd with a Rope about the Middle, and with four Nails fasten'd to a Cross against the City Wall, they are flead alive, or bray'd to pieces in a Mortar.</P>
<P>There is another inhumane Torture in use, which for the barbarousness we will describe: Upon a Gallows are two Hooks, the one fasten'd to a short, the
<PB N="154" REF="105"/>
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of torture method</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> other to a long Chain; the Malefactor so soon as he comes thither, climbs up the Ladder with the Executioner, who thrusting the Hook through his left Hand, hangs him by it on the shortest Chain; then to that on the longer, he fastens him by the soal of his right Foot, where by insufferable Torments, he often remains hanging three, four, or more days before he dies.</P>
<P>Those that have committed any crime at Sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea-Justice.</NOTE> are ty'd to the Mast or Stee∣rage, and shot to death with Arrows, or else his hands and Feet cut off, and set before the Mouth of a Cannon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usual Punishments.</NOTE> and so shot all to pieces. To drag them in pieces with four Ships, to which they are ty'd, and then cast the Quarters into the Sea, is a usual Punishment; so it is to cut off limb by limb, or joint by joint; but to tye them up in a Sack,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Light Punishments.</NOTE> and draw them, is held a gentle and milde Sentence. 'Tis capital to lift up the Hand against a <HI>Janizary,</HI> or to commit Adultery with a <HI>Mahumetan Woman.</HI> But this later is connived at, because they believe that all sins by washing in the Bath, or by once plunging into the Sea, are washed away.</P>
<P>Their Lodging is very mean,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houshold-stuff.</NOTE> being only a Mattress in stead of a Bed, which they lay upon a floor of Boards. They sleep in their Drawers or <HI>Calsoons;</HI> they have neither Chairs, Stools or Tables, but hang their Cloaths upon Pins in the Wall. Those of Quality sit at Meals, and all other times upon pieces of Ta∣pistry, cross-legg'd on the Ground; but poor People have a great Matt, made of the leaves of a Date or Palm-tree.</P>
<P>The Men wear next their Skin a large Linnen Frock and Drawers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of the Men.</NOTE> and o∣ver that a loose Coat of Cloth or Silk, buttoned before with great Gold or Silver Buttons, and hangs down almost to the knee. Their Sleeves reach but to their Elbows; so that turning up their Shirt upon them, their Arms are for the most part half way bare or naked; and instead of Stockins, the great men of the Court, and other People of quality, sometime wear small Turky-Lea∣ther Buskins.</P>
<P>They shave their Hair all off, except a little Lock, which they let grow up∣on the Crown of their Heads, because forsooth <HI>Mahomet</HI> shall pull them up

</FIGURE> to Paradise; as the Angel brought <HI>Abaccuck</HI> to <HI>Daniel</HI> into the Lions Den: Some cut off the whole Beard, reserving onely two large <HI>Mustacheo's;</HI> but such as are stricken into years, wear their Beards long grown, but cut round.</P>
<P>They wear <HI>Turbants</HI> made of red Wooll, wound up in a piece of Cotton five or six Ells long.</P>
<P>Their Slippers are piked at the Toe, of yellow or red Leather, shod under the Heel with Iron, having no Lappets; which they slip off at the door of any house whereto they enter, as a great point of Civility.</P>
<P>They wear at their Girdles three very fine Knives, that is, two great, and one small, in a silver Scabbard a foot long, adorned with Turkoyses, and Smarag'd or Emeral'd Stones, so rich sometime, that they stand them in above a hundred <HI>Escues.</HI></P>
<P>When they make water, they stoop down to the ground;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they make water.</NOTE> for it is held a shameless thing to urine standing, as the Christians do: And the reason may be, because if the least drop of their water fall upon them, they are polluted, and must forthwith wash themselves.</P>
<P>The Women are Habited almost like the Men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of the Wo∣men.</NOTE> onely having a fine Linnen Cloth on their Heads in stead of a <HI>Turbant:</HI> Their <HI>Semaires</HI> come but to half their Thighs, the rest naked. Rich Women wear commonly five or six Pen∣dants in each Ear, with Bracelets of Jewels on their Arms, and Silk Garments. They paint the ends of their Fingers blue, with an Herb call'd by them <HI>Gueva,</HI> perhaps our common Woad. When they go along the City in the Streets, they cast over all a Cotton Cloak, which hangs down to their Feet, and tie a string of Pearls upon their Foreheads, and a fine Kerchiff before their Eyes, so that they cannot be known as they go up and down the Streets. All their occasions lie within the house, where they have a several apartment by them∣selves, wherein none but Women may visit each other, the Master of the House himself being at such times excluded, to prevent all occasions of jealousie.</P>
<P>They are curious in the beautifying themselves according to the Fashion of their Countrey, painting their Eye-brows and Eye-lids, and colouring their Hair black with burned <HI>Antimony.</HI></P>
<PB N="156" REF="106"/>
<P>The usual Food of the Countrey is commonly Rice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> Cuscous, Mutton, Veal, some Beef, and Fowl. When ever they slaughter any Beast, they say over each, <HI>I kill thee in the Name of God;</HI> then turning themselves to the South, they cut the Throat quite through, like the <HI>Jews,</HI> that it may bleed the more; else they count it unclean, and dare not eat of it.</P>
<P>Their Drink at Meals is either clear Water, or <HI>Sorbet,</HI> for Wine is forbidden them by the <HI>Alcoran:</HI> And in the mornings when Tradesmen and Merchants meet about business, they go to the Publick <HI>Coffee-Houses,</HI> which Liquor they drink, having a great opinion of it, smoaking abundance of Tobacco, spend∣ing much of their time there. In stead of Table-Cloths, they use red Turky-Leather Carpets, and wipe their fingers on their Handkerchiffs in stead of Nap∣kins: Onely at Solemn Festivals, the great ones wipe upon a blue Cloth fixed to the Carpet.</P>
<P>Their Cups and Dishes are of Tin or Earth;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cups or Vessels.</NOTE> for none may use Silver; onely the <HI>Sultans,</HI> they are all of Massy-Gold. Liquid things they eat with wooden Spoons a Foot long.</P>
<P>Gaming is unlawful among them, so that they neither play at Dice, Cards, Balls, Bowls, nor any other Sport usual with us. Sometime they will play a Game at Chess, but not for money.</P>
<P>Bathes are much used,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great use of Baths.</NOTE> besides their frequent Washings enjoyned before De∣votion; so that every place almost is filled with <HI>Bannia's.</HI></P>
<P>Every City hath also many Free-Schools, or <HI>Mesquites,</HI> for the instructing of Youth to Read, Write, and cast Accompts, but no further. The principal Book they learn, is the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which when a Scholar can read well, his School-fellows lead him in his best Habit along the Streets, and set forth his Commen∣dation through the City; for beyond this none learn.</P>
<P>Thus having shewed you the Manners and Customs of the People, we shall now in short give an account of the nature of the Soyl, and what Beasts and Plants it produces.</P>
<P>¶ THere are in <HI>Barbary</HI> very many Springs and Rivers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rivers.</NOTE> the chiefest of which take their Rise in, and Fall down from the greater <HI>Atlas,</HI> though some others claim distinct Originals; all which disembogue either into the Great <HI>Atlantick</HI> or <HI>Midland-Sea.</HI> The Waters springing from <HI>Atlas,</HI> relish of that Earth whence they arise, and are for the most part thick and sedimenty, especially on the Bor∣ders of <HI>Mauritania.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Coast of <HI>Barbary</HI> lying on the Ocean,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scituation of it.</NOTE> <HI>Atlas,</HI> and the utmost Southerly Parts of the Territory of <HI>Sus,</HI> as far as the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> is very fruitful in the Production of Wheat and Barley, full of Meadow-Ground, and luxurious in Herbage to feed up Cattel.</P>
<P>The other on the <HI>Midland-Sea,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Soil of <HI>Barbary</HI> is at the <HI>Mediterranean Sea</HI></NOTE> from the <HI>Streights,</HI> to the Eastern Borders of <HI>Tripolis,</HI> is uneven, craggy, and full of Mountains, which in some places ex∣tend twenty or thirty Miles; between which and the Great <HI>Atlas,</HI> are not onely pleasant, but luxuriant Valleys intervein'd with Brooks and Rivulets de∣scending from those great Hills, and shaded on each side with delightful Groves, reaching as far as <HI>Cairavan.</HI></P>
<P>But that part call'd <HI>Errif,</HI> near the <HI>Little Atlas,</HI> is subject to Cold more than Heat, so that it produces little Wheat, but great plenty of Barley; a very good Commodity in those parts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Atlas</HI> is in some places unhabitable, because of the excessive
<PB N="157" REF="106"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Cold; particularly over against <HI>Tremesin,</HI> where in the Winter are such fierce and driving Snows, that neither Man nor Beast can tarry there long without hazard of life, the Snow overwhelming the whole face of the Ground to that heighth, that the tallest Trees are not discernable: But at the return of Sum∣mer, when the Snows dissolve, first the Trees appear, and after that a plea∣sant Verdure clothes the Ground, inviting thither the Herdsmen to depasture their Cattle.</P>
<P>The Fruits growing in this Countrey are very delicious; the Raisins, Figs, Cherries, Plumbs, Peaches, Quinces, and Apricocks, having a more brisk and quick Gust; and the Pomegranates, Oranges, Citrons, are more pleasing and sweet, than the same in other Countreys. Their Olive-Trees in <HI>Morocco, Fez,</HI> and <HI>Algier,</HI> are very thick, bushy, and high, but in <HI>Tunis</HI> neither bigger nor better than in <HI>Europe.</HI> Here grows also abundance of Sugar-Canes, and Cot∣ton Trees.</P>
<P>Among others, here grows upon the Coast of the <HI>Midland-Sea,</HI> a shrubby Plant, call'd in <HI>Arabick, Achaovan Abiat;</HI> that is to say, <HI>White St. Johns Wort,</HI> or <HI>White Mugwort.</HI> It ha's many branches, two or three Cubits high, bearing an Ash-colour'd Wool, with broad and deep indented Leaves, black on the inside, and on the outside white; but in thickness and growth, like the Leaves of our <HI>Mugwort;</HI> the Blossoms are yellow, like <HI>Grunsill,</HI> and vanish at last disperst into a Powder: This Plant is cherish'd here most for Ornament of several Gardens, and by a modern Herbalist is call'd <HI>Cineraria,</HI> that is, <HI>Ash-plant,</HI> and <HI>Jacobea Marina,</HI> that is, <HI>Sea-Saint-James-wort,</HI> because it grows upon the Sea-shore, and agrees with the common <HI>Jacobea,</HI> or <HI>Saint-James-wort.</HI></P>
<P>The Decoction of it taken is good against the Stone in the Kidneys or Blad∣der, and all inward oppilations.</P>
<P>Here are numerous Herds both of great and small Cattel, and in the Woody and more Mountainous Parts, incredible numbers of Wilde Goats, Lyons and Tygers, and other Savage Monsters; as also Fowl, and Venomous Serpents.</P>

<P>Their Women constantly keep within doors, using Spinning, working Ta∣pistry, or doing other things, and have black and white Slaves of both Sexes, to serve them on all occasions.</P>
<P>For want of Knives they break their Bread in pieces with their Hands, and eat their Meat on Matts spread on the Ground, as we said before.</P>
<P>They have variety of Dishes, as Beef, Mutton, Fowl and Venison;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> but their most usual is <HI>Couscous,</HI> made of Meal, Rice, and other Ingredients, mixt with water, and made up in Balls, then put into an Earthen Vessel full of lit∣tle holes, set upon the Hearth, the heat whereof Bakes it enough.

Feasting is here very frequent, especially in the Houses of Great Persons, where for one Entertainment, sometimes twenty, or five and twenty Sheep, all of a large size than ours, are drest.</P>

<P>If a Woman will part from her Husband, she loseth her Marriage-Goods.</P>
<P>Besides their Wives, they may keep as many Concubines as they are able to maintain, out of which the King may choose one to bestow upon his Favorites. They count it no Crime to obstuprate their Slaves, White or Black. The King hath commonly four Wives, besides a multitude of Concubines, with whom he companies according to the dictates of his wandring Fancy.</P>
<P>On the day of Marriage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Solemnity of Mar∣riage.</NOTE> they set the Bride on a Mule, sumptuously adorn'd and set forth, begirt with a round Canopy in form of a Tower, cover'd with Ta∣pistry, after the <HI>Turkish Manner,</HI> so carrying her in State through the whole City, follow'd by many Muletts laden with the Goods, given her by her intended Husband, and attended with Men and Women in great Multitudes.

Another Device the King uses to possess himself of the Peoples Wealth: When he hath intelligence of any rich Person, he sends for him, and under colour of Favour, confers on him some Office that receives a Salary from the Crown, in which continuing to his Death, makes the King a Title to his Estate; which is the cause that every one, as well at <HI>Morocco</HI> as <HI>Fez,</HI> to prevent this inconvenience, endeavour to con∣ceal their Wealth, and keep as far from Court, and the Kings knowledge, as possible.</P>
<P>The King also takes one Beast in twenty, and two when the Number riseth to a hundred. His Collectors also gather the tenth of all Fruits growing in the Mountains, which the People pay as a Rent for their Land.</P>

<P><HI>Rabad</HI> or <HI>Rabald,</HI> now <HI>New Sale,</HI> almost also Four-square,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Sale.</NOTE> stands in a Val∣ley between two high Precipices; those on the Land-side much higher, and uneasier to ascend, than those on the Sea-shore.</P>
<P>A double Wall guards the Land-side, the one old, the other new, between which they reserve a proportion of Land, half as big as the Town, wherein they Sow yearly several Grains: The outer or new Wall defending the En∣trance between the aforemention'd great Hills, boasts an extraordinary Thickness, and the Heighth of thirty Foot, or thereabouts; but towards the Sea lies in a manner open.</P>
<P>Three Gates on the Land-side give entrance into it; one on the East,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gates.</NOTE> and two on the South, <HI>viz.</HI> The Gate of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and the Gate of <HI>Temsina.</HI></P>
<P>Close by the River upon a rising Ground, standeth <HI>Asan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tower <HI>Asan.</HI></NOTE> a Four-square Tower so call'd; adjacent to which is a Church built without a Roof, above and without are Arches about fourteen hundred Foot long, and three hun∣dred broad, with a square Steeple of Stone two hundred Foot in Compass; the Ascent to whose Top is so easie and broad, that sometimes attempting, they scale the Top with Waggons and Horses.</P>
<P>The South Point of the Steeple being towards the Church, stands with a gaping Rent receiv'd by a dreadful Thunderbolt.</P>
<P>Through the Church runs a Brook about thirty Foot deep, and a hundred broad, made in a Channel or Trough of Stone, guessed to be intended as a Bathing-place for the <HI>Moors.</HI></P>
<P>Here also a strong Castle, call'd <HI>Alkassave,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle <HI>Alkassave.</HI></NOTE> seems proudly to swell into the bigness of a little City, encompassed with thick Walls, and a deep dry Trench. Formerly it inclosed two hundred Houses, which at present are most of them faln or falling; onely one Tower remains, whose Top is a∣dorned with <HI>Mahumetan</HI>'s <HI>Crescents.</HI> This Castle was heretofore as a <HI>Seraglio</HI> for the King of <HI>Morocco</HI>'s Concubines, to the number of eight hundred, un∣der the Guard of Eunuchs; but now the Residence and Seat of the Gover∣nours.</P>
<P>Without the City lie several Sconces and Redoubts, made of Loam, and cast up when the Castle was Besieg'd, in the Year Sixteen hundred and sixty.</P>
<P>Within these Cities are several <HI>Mosques,</HI> with inclosed Yards round about, and without divers <HI>Mesquites.</HI></P>
<P>The Houses, especially in <HI>Old Sale,</HI> are very small and slightly built,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> though here and there some are richly set out with Carv'd Work, and Marble Pil∣lars: Generally they are but one Story high, without any Windows to the
<PB N="180" REF="124"/>Street, or other opening than the Door; all their Light descends from a Loover in the midst, about which the Chambers are placed; the whole Edifice flat-rooft, for conveniency of Walking Morning and Evening, for the benefit of the cool refreshing Air.</P>
<P>The Haven is very spacious,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Haven.</NOTE> but shallow, having at low Tyde not above a Foot, or a Foot and a half Water, though at full Sea eleven or twelve. Before the Haven lyeth a Barr, passable at High Water with loaden Barks and Ships, either out or in, whereas when the Tyde is out, they must remain at the Ri∣vers mouth, and unload their Goods into small Boats; out of which Landed, they carry them through the Gate <HI>Sidimusa Ducala,</HI> upon Asses and Camels into the City. This shallowness of the Haven compels the <HI>Corsaires</HI> or Pyrates of this Place to use light Vessels that draw little Water, which proves better for the Chace, and more advantageous in their Pyracies, and also in escaping Ships of greater Burden, whereas they of <HI>Algiers, Tunis</HI> and <HI>Tripolis,</HI> from the convenience of their Haven, put to Sea in greater Vessels.</P>
<P>The Revenue consists in Tributes and Customs of Exported and Imported Merchandise,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Revenue.</NOTE> all which pays ten in the Hundred.</P>
<P>The Countrey People under its Jurisdiction pay the tenth of all their Land-Fruits for a Tribute. And the Pyrates, by their Robberies against the Christi∣ans, bring no small Advantage.</P>
<P>These Cities are now Govern'd by an <HI>Alcaide,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Government.</NOTE> who with his chosen Councel manage all Affairs, either Martial or Civil. In the Election of a new Gover∣nour or Deputy, they proceed with no regularity, the Commons or <HI>Plebeians</HI> sometimes setting up one from among themselves, or if it were possible, below themselves, as they did some few Years since, when without the consent of the King or Nobles, running together upon the Governours death, without any the least appearance of Reason, they set up in this mad fit an Ass-driver, and by their own Authority impowered him; but he soon after his Advance∣ment using the same severity, rough handling and menaces to his new Subjects, as towards his old Slave the Ass; they no longer pleased with his so rigorous Government, kickt him out of the Saddle, and left him to conduct by those stern Rules his old Servant. Other great Alterations often happen in the chusing of Governours, insomuch that sometimes it hath been known, that there have been three new Governours in a Moneth, so often turned out, either out of the Peoples hatred to them, or for their own Misgovernment; and yet their whole Jurisdiction reaches no farther than over a few little Cities, and some wandring <HI>Advars,</HI> that is, <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P>This City hath from the first Foundation, been subject to Commotions and Alterations, but more especially since the coming of the <HI>Andaluzian Moors,</HI> that were driven out of <HI>Spain,</HI> as will presently appear.</P>
<P>During the continuance of the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> which was from the Year Se∣ven hundred and twelve, (for then they made their Conquests) for Six or seven hundred Years they kept possession; all which time the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> made it their Master-piece to drive them out, especially <HI>Ferdinando</HI> the Fifteenth; for he taking into serious Consideration the great mischief by them done to the Christians, and the continual Wars wherewith they infested them, in the Year Fourteen hundred ninety two, set fiercely upon them, who seeing themselves in a straight, and even brought under the power and obedience of <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> seem'd to embrace Christianity, though scarce in outward appearance they were such; however, it gain'd them a breathing while, and gave them oppor∣tunities
<PB N="181" REF="124"/>of endeavour, at least to distract that State; so that in the Year Sixteen hundred and ten, <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by an Edict published the Sixteenth of <HI>January,</HI> banisht them out of his Kingdom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Andaluzian Moors</HI> driven out of <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> and for fear of incurring the penalties thereof, above a Million of Men, Women and Children of all Sexes, departed within the time limited, the greatest part of whom taking Ship, passed into <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>But others spread themselves into the East about <HI>Constantinople,</HI> some came into <HI>France</HI> with the consent of the King, who allotted them a place to dwell in; conditionally, they observ'd the <HI>Roman Catholick Religion,</HI> wherein by perform∣ance of their Articles they so fixed themselves, that at this Day some Families of them are to be found in <HI>Provence</HI> and <HI>Languedoc.</HI></P>
<P>Such of them as pitched at <HI>Salee,</HI> were admitted with freedom by the King of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> believing they might be useful to instruct his People in many Trades and Handicrafts. Here a while they lived Peaceably, yielding equal Obedience with the other Subjects; but they soon started aside, and with the Money, which in great quantities they brought from <HI>Spain,</HI> bought Arms and some Ships, wherewith they apply'd themselves to Roving and Pyracy at Sea, pretending at first to take from none but the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in revenge of their in∣flicted Banishment, though indeed and in truth their malice raged upon all the Christians. 'Tis true, at the beginning they play'd fast and loose, under pre∣tence of Trading and Merchandise, setting up <HI>Spanish</HI> Flags and Colours in their Masts and Sterns, and acting all in the name of <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Andaluzjans</HI> be∣ginning to take from the Christians.</NOTE> as they were by Birth and Language, by which they did great Robberies; but at last this Trick growing stale, they pull'd their Vizards off, and declared themselves openly Pyrates and Enemies to all Christians. Whatsoever Prizes they took, they pay'd to the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> as a Tribute, seven or ten in the Hundred, as well of Prisoners as of Merchandise. Thus for a time they continued their Subjection to the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> but still waiting an opportunity to throw off the yoak; and indeed they wanted not a specious pretence, for under the colour of furnishing their Ships, they got into their hands the best Arms in <HI>Salee,</HI> of which possessed and instigated by the natural Ambition of the Coun∣trey they were bred in, they brought to pass those Designs they had been so long secretly contriving: For first they made themselves Masters of the <HI>Alkassave,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They rise up against the King of <HI>Morocco.</HI></NOTE> or Castle of <HI>Salee,</HI> and by that means of the City; which done, they dis∣arm'd the <HI>Moors,</HI> banish'd the Natives, and expell'd all the King of <HI>Morocco</HI>'s Officers; and for their Assistance they invited to them other exiled <HI>Andaluzians,</HI> by whose help they took up Arms and declar'd themselves no more to be Go∣verned by Kings.</P>
<P>As soon as the King heard of this Insurrection,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Agreement of the King of <HI>Fez.</HI></NOTE> he immediately sent an Ar∣my thither to block up the City, which by the Charm or Magick of a Rebel <HI>Santon</HI> or <HI>Marabou,</HI> call'd <HI>Layassen,</HI> an inveterate Enemy to the King, so routed and afflicted the Royal Army, that the King was necessitated to break up the Siege; yet before he marched off, he made with the Rebels these Articles fol∣lowing.</P>
<P N="1">That they did acknowledge Him for their Chief, and as a Token of their Submission, should every Year, as a Tribute, present some Slaves.</P>
<P N="2">That the King should appoint them Officers to do Justice, and hear and decide Causes among them.</P>
<P N="3">That the City and the Castle should remain in their Custody.</P>
<PB N="182" REF="125"/>
<P>Thus rested Affairs for a while, but the King at last got possession of the Fort, and settled a Garrison in it; which the <HI>Andaluzian Moors</HI> for some time murmur'd at, but at length, in the Year Sixteen hundred and sixty, they began again to take up Arms against those of the Castle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Insurrections of the <HI>Andaluzians.</HI></NOTE> beleagured before by about two thousand Souldiers of <HI>Santa Crux,</HI> and other Places, under the Command of one <HI>Hamed Aginnivi,</HI> which at last so far prevail'd, that on the tenth of <HI>February</HI> the Citizens of both the Cities joined Forces with him to beleaguer and straighten the Castle, though with little hope of suddenly obtaining it; whereupon in the City they cast up several Works and Forti∣fications of Loam, from whence, with Muskets, for want of great Guns, they daily alarm'd those of the Castle; the like did they of <HI>Old Salee</HI> with their great Guns. On the other side, the Besieged were not wanting to defend them∣selves, both with great and small Shot, which they plyed with such effect, that they kill'd many as well in the Works as the Streets; whereupon con∣sidering with themselves, and finding their own strength too weak for their Designs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They send a Chief Of∣ficer to <HI>Gailand.</HI></NOTE> they sent to <HI>Abdulkada Gailand,</HI> Lord of <HI>Arzile, Tituan</HI> and <HI>Alkazer,</HI> a chief Officer, to crave his Assistance, whereto he presently consented, dispatch∣ing thither <HI>Abdelkador Ceron,</HI> to look to <HI>New Salce;</HI> and <HI>Hadzi Fenis,</HI> with <HI>Hadzi Ibrahim Manino,</HI> to take charge of the Old City. <HI>Ceron</HI> had not long continued in his new Government, before he was treacherously surprized in his House, his Neck broke, and his Body cut to pieces; whose Death, as it begot no small terror in the hearts of the Citizens, so it heighten'd the hopes of those in the Castle. Nor did this rebellious Faction contain it self within the Walls, but as other infections, spread into the Country adjoyning; where not onely Towns, but every Family were divided into Parties, by which Contrast and Se∣paration among themselves, minding solely their mad Disputes, the Ground lay neglected, Tillage and Husbandry thrown by, whereby so great a Famine followed, that in the Year Sixteen hundred and sixty, many thousands perisht for want of sustenance.</P>
<P>In like manner,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The secret Conveyance of Provision by the Citi∣zens to them in the Castle.</NOTE> those in the Castle were distressed for want of Provisions, notwithstanding some Citizens sent them under-hand Supplies almost daily, partly out of a sense of their Duty to the King, and partly out of a desire of their own gain, though upon Discovery many of them were severely punished for it. Besides, the <HI>English</HI> were great Supporters of the loyalty of those in the Castle, by sending in to them Provision of all kinds from their Ships, which then lay in the River; as on the contrary, the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> animated the Rebels.</P>
<P>In the end,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Agreement.</NOTE> after the Wars had thus continued a while, <HI>Sid Tagar, Gailand</HI>'s Brother, came with about Three hundred Horse from <HI>Arzile</HI> to <HI>Salee,</HI> to make a Peace with those of the <HI>Castle,</HI> which upon the fifteenth and six∣teenth day of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred sixty four, was concluded, to the great rejoycing of the Inhabitants, upon Condition that of all the Con∣tributions or Tenth-Moneys, which the Goods imported produced, one third Part should go to the Castle, another to <HI>New Salee,</HI> and the last third Part to <HI>Old Salee.</HI></P>
<P>On the third of <HI>May, Gailand</HI> was owned by those of the Castle for their Lord, and as a token of their Joy, these Volleys of Cannon-shot made Pro∣clamation thereof; and the next day his Brother <HI>Sid Tagar</HI> drew away with his Soldiers to <HI>Arzile.</HI></P>
<P>But the fifth of <HI>October</HI> came <HI>Gailand</HI> himself in Person, accompanied with
<PB N="183" REF="125"/>three or four hundred Horse from <HI>Arzile,</HI> and pitched by the River; about eight in the Morning he was invited by the Governor <HI>Sid Hamed Aginnivy,</HI> into the Castle, which the next day was deliver'd up,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle delivered up to <HI>Gayland.</HI></NOTE> beyond expectation of all that were concern'd; which done, the sixteenth <HI>Gayland</HI> withdrew again to <HI>Arzile,</HI> having the before-mention'd <HI>Aginnivy</HI> and <HI>Sid Hamed el Xhymir</HI> Gover∣nors of it for him.</P>
<P>The tenth of <HI>December, Sid Hamed Aginnivy</HI> took his Collegue Governor and put him in Hold, charging him to have conceal'd a hundred weight of Silver from <HI>Sid Abdala,</HI> the former Lord of the Castle, and fined him a thousand <HI>Pe∣soes</HI> or <HI>Pieces of Eight.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty ninth of <HI>March,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred sixty five, ano∣ther of <HI>Gayland</HI>'s Brothers, <HI>Sid Sybi</HI> came thither, and took away with him all the principal Persons of <HI>Salee,</HI> whom on the second of the same month he carried to <HI>Arzile,</HI> thrusting into the City a Garrison of Two thousand Horse and Foot. During the time of his stay, he was very friendly received by <HI>Sid Hamed;</HI> how∣ever, he cashiered the old Soldiers of <HI>Santa Crux,</HI> and other Places, who had so long guarded the Castle; and not only so, but took from some of them what they had, and Imprison'd others. These tyrannies produc'd new Commotions; for on the one and thirtieth in the Morning, the <HI>Andaluzians</HI> and their Com∣plices chose <HI>Sid Abdulkadar Merino</HI> Commander in Chief, sending the former Prisoner to the Castle. In like manner <HI>Xache Brahim Manino,</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Old Salee,</HI> they displaced, and put into his stead <HI>Xache Fenis.</HI></P>
<P>The first of <HI>April, Sid Tybi</HI> with his own Hand, led <HI>Sid Hamed Aginnivy</HI> out at the Gate of the Castle, under the Custody of <HI>Abulkadar,</HI> but after a little stay he was discharged and set at liberty, with a Reward of Two hundred Ducats: The same Day most of the Women also were sent out of the Castle to <HI>Old Salee;</HI> but <HI>Aginnivy</HI> not contented with this, as he thought too slight a reward, the third day after took his Journey towards <HI>Arzile,</HI> to make his Complaint to <HI>Gayland.</HI> But the two and twentieth, tidings came to <HI>Salee,</HI> that upon <HI>Friday</HI> before their <HI>Passeover,</HI> he died suddenly, not without great suspicion of Poyson.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> the Governours of the City took <HI>Merino</HI> and <HI>Xache Fenis,</HI> with one <HI>Abulkadar Roxo,</HI> to <HI>Arzile,</HI> and returned to <HI>Salee</HI> the fourth of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>The sixteenth of <HI>June,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred sixty and six, <HI>Gailand,</HI> Lord of <HI>Alkazir,</HI> drew into the Field against <HI>Muly Resis,</HI> King of <HI>Tafilet,</HI> Brother to the King of <HI>Fez;</HI> but three Days after came back again to <HI>Alkazir:</HI> About two Days after he drew into the Field again, was met by the King of <HI>Tafilet,</HI> routed and put to Flight, with the loss of many, and revolt of more Soldiers, to the Kings side; <HI>Gailand</HI> himself wounded with a <HI>Semiter,</HI> escaping to <HI>Alkazir,</HI> but not daring to trust himself there, within an hour fled to <HI>Arzile.</HI> The King without any opposition took in <HI>Alkazir,</HI> whereupon <HI>Tituan</HI> and <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Salee</HI> fell to him; so that now the City and Castle was once more reduced un∣der the Power of the King of <HI>Fez.</HI> Once before the <HI>Portugues</HI> took it, but were not able to hold it long ere it returned to the right Owner.</P>
<P>In the Year Sixteen hundred fifty nine, in <HI>July,</HI> three Ambassadors came from <HI>Salee</HI> to the States of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> to renew a League, begun <HI>Anno</HI> One thousand six hundred fifty one, and Confirmed in <HI>April,</HI> One thousand six hundred fifty seven; and further to treat of Matters relating to the Benefit of both Parties, and after many Conferences they agreed on certain Articles; which not relating to the purpose, and being too long for our way of carry∣ing

<P>When <HI>Sydan,</HI> the third Son of <HI>Hamet,</HI> after the Death of his Father and Bro∣thers, had possest himself of the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> though afterwards stripped both of that and <HI>Morocco</HI> for a time, by the several opposite Factions in those Kingdoms, commanded by <HI>Hamet Ben Abdela,</HI> a Religious, but hypocritical Heremite, who hoping to get all for himself, was opposed by <HI>Sid Hean,</HI> that took part with <HI>Sydan;</HI> by which assistance the Tumults at last were pacified in some measure; yet nevertheless a rabble of Pyrates invested themselves in this chief Port of <HI>Fez,</HI> inabling themselves thereby to do him infinite mischief, both by Sea and Land, and not to him only, but all others whose business of Trade drew them into those infested Seas. Many fruitless Attempts he made upon them, so that considering his own weakness at Sea for want of Ship∣ping, he sent an Embassador unto King <HI>Charles</HI> the First of <HI>England,</HI> to desire his Assistance; Nor did that Pious Prince need much Importuning to put his hand to so good a Work, for he soon dispatched thither the requested Aids, by whose Assistance <HI>Sydan</HI> became Master of the Town, unroosted and punished the Pyrates, and sent Three hundred Christian-Slaves freed for a Present to his Majesty. Nor staid he there, but raising his thoughts to a higher Pitch of General Good, he sent another Embassador with a Letter to His Majesty, to give him the like Assistance against <HI>Algiers,</HI> who Roved with as much Cruelty through the <HI>Mediterrane,</HI> as the <HI>Salee-Men</HI> before had done over the <HI>Atlantick.</HI> The which Letter savouring of more than <HI>Mahumetan Piety,</HI> and much conducing to the King of <HI>Great Britains</HI> Honour, we will Insert for Satisfaction.</P>

<P><HI>WHEN these our Letters shall be so happy as to come to Your Majesties Sight, I wish the Spirit of the Righteous God may so direct your Mind, that you may joyfully embrace the Message I send. The Regal Power allotted to Us, makes Us common Servants to our Creator, then of those People whom we Govern: So that observing the Duties We owe to God, We deliver Blessings to the World; in providing for the publick good of Our Estates, We magnifie the Honour of God like the Celestial Bodies, which though they have much Veneration, yet serve only to the Benefit of the World. It is the excellency of Our Office to be Instruments whereby Happiness is delivered unto the Nations. Pardon me, Sir! This is not to Instruct, (for I know I speak to one of a more clear and quick sight than my self) but I speak this because God hath pleased to grant Me a happy Victory over some part of those Rebellious Pyrates, that so long have molested the peaceable Trade of</HI> Europe, <HI>and hath presented further occasion to root out the Ge∣neration of those, who have been so pernitious to the good of Our Nations: I mean since it hath pleased God to be so cuspicious to Our beginnings in the Conquest of</HI> Sale, <HI>that We might joyn and proceed in hope of like Success in the War of</HI> Tunis, Algiers, <HI>and other Places (Dens and Receptacles for the inhumane Villanies of those who abhor Rule and Go∣vernment.) Herein whilst We interrupt the corruption of Malignant spirits of the World, We shall glorifie the great God, and perform a Duty that will shine as glorious as the Sun and
<PB N="186" REF="127"/>Moon, which all the Earth may see and reverence; a Work that shall ascend as sweet as the Perfume of the most precious Odours, in the Nostrils of the Lord; a Work grateful and happy to Men; a Work whose Memory shall be reverenced so long as there shall be any re∣maining amongst Men that love and honour the Piety and Vertue of Noble Minds. This Acti∣on I here willingly present to You, whose Piety and Vertues equal the Greatness of Your Power; that We who are Vicegerents to the Great and Mighty God, may hand in hand triumph in the Glory which the Action presents unto us. Now because the Islands which You Govern have been ever Famous for the unconquered Strength of their Shipping, I have sent this my trusty Servant and Ambassador, to know whether in Your Princely Wisdom You shall think fit to assist Me with such Forces by Sea as shall be answerable to those I provide by Land, which if You please to grant, I doubt not but</HI> The Lord of Hosts <HI>will protect and assist those that Fight in so glorious a Cause. Nor ought You to think this strange, that I, who so much reverence the Peace and Accord of Nations, should exhort to a War. Your Great Prophet</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>was the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> JUDAH, <HI>as well as the</HI> Lord <HI>and</HI> Giver of Peace, <HI>which may signifie unto You, That he which is a Lover and Maintainer of Peace, must al∣ways appear with the Terror of his Sword, and wading through Seas of Blood, must arrive to Tranquility. This made</HI> JAMES <HI>Your Father of glorious Memory, so happily Renowned among all Nations: It was the Noble Fame of Your Princely Vertues, which resounds to the utmost corners of the Earth, that perswaded me to invite You to partake of that Blessing wherein I boast my self most Happy. I wish God may heap the Riches of his Blessings on You, increase Your Happiness with Your Days, and hereafter perpetuate the Greatness of Your Name in all Ages.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Habad,</HI> or <HI>Rabat,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Hubbed,</HI> is a Castle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habad.</NOTE> environ'd with strong Walls, built by <HI>Mahumetan Priests,</HI> opposite to <HI>Sale,</HI> so standing, that from thence they have a large Prospect of all the adjacent Countrey. The Opinion is, that this Town or Citadel formerly was large and very Potent, but now in a low and miserable condition, Inhabited by <HI>Moors</HI> and wilde <HI>Arabs,</HI> that only live from hand to mouth, by Forrage and Plunder, having no Commerce, pretend∣ing Vassalage to the Kings of <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Halvan,</HI> or according to some, <HI>Chanban,</HI> a Wall'd Village,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Halvan.</NOTE> lying two Miles Eastward from <HI>Fez,</HI> at the River <HI>Sebu,</HI> or <HI>Subu,</HI> having without the Walls a Hot Bath, with very fair Inns.</P>
<P>But the most Eminent City of all is <HI>Fez,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Mahumetans,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Fez.</HI></NOTE> Western-Court,</HI> and by some held to be <HI>Silde,</HI> by others the <HI>Volubilis</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> This City was first founded, <HI>Anno</HI> Eight hundred and one, by one <HI>Idris,</HI> the natural Son of <HI>Idris,</HI> by his Handmaid, he being a dispossessed <HI>Arabian Patriarch.</HI> The Ori∣ginal of the Name <HI>Fez,</HI> is by some brought from the <HI>Arabian</HI> word <HI>Fez,</HI> signify∣ing <HI>Gold,</HI> because at the first breaking of the Ground, to lay the Foundation, there was Golden Oar found; but others will have it from the River <HI>Fez,</HI> which Waters the City.</P>
<P>It stands remoted from the Sea a hundred Miles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form of it.</NOTE> with rough and almost in∣accessible ways to it. The Form is a Quadrangular Oblong, hedg'd in on every side with Suburbs, all encompast with high and stately Walls, wrought artificially with Brick and Free-Stone, fortifi'd round about with Towers, but few Redoubts, according to the Modern, but onely Flanker'd at the Gates, which are in all eighty six; some of them Water-Gates, a Stream running through them: So near surrounded with Hills, that there remains no more Level, but what the City stands upon. It is divided into twelve Wards or Precincts, containing sixty two spacious Markets, set with Artificers and Tradesmens Shops round about, above two hundred Eminent Streets, toge∣ther with a great number of cross and by-Lanes, all which are adorn'd on both sides with large and stately Edifices, besides seven hundred <HI>Mosques,</HI> a great number of Colledges, Hospitals, Mills, and common <HI>Bannia's.</HI> This as to the general, we shall now make a more particular Inquisition.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Fez,</HI> which <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> calls <HI>Rhasalme,</HI> passes through the City
<PB N="188" REF="128"/>in two Branches; one runs Southward towards <HI>New Fez,</HI> and the other West; each of these again subdividing into many other clear running Chan∣nels through the Streets, serving not onely each private House, but Churches, Inns, Hospitals, and all other publick Places, to their great Con∣veniences.</P>
<P>Round about the <HI>Mosques</HI> are a hundred and fifty Common-Houses of Ease∣ment, built Four-square, and divided into Single-Stool-Rooms, each furished with a Cock and a Marble Cistern, which scowreth and keeps all neat and clean, as if these Places were intended for some sweeter Employment.</P>
<P>Here also are two hundred and fifty Bridges,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Like <HI>London-Bridge</HI> be∣fore the Fire.</NOTE> many of which are built on both sides, that they are not onely Thorow-fares, but of all Trades there.</P>
<P>There are eighty six publick Springs or Wells, which afford the Citizens abundance of Water, besides six hundred other in Palaces, Hospitals, and great Buildings.</P>
<P>The Houses are artificially built of Bricks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Houses.</NOTE> and Stones; their Fronts Car∣ved out with all sorts of Imagery; the Rooms and Galleries, of Brick and Tile, and pourtray'd with Flowers and variety of Colours; and for the greater lustre, they shine with a rare Varnish.</P>
<P>The Cielings and Beams of the Rooms are commonly Gilt, Carv'd, and Painted with delightful Colours; the Roofs are flat, and artificially laid with Pavements, which in Summer are cool Reposes.</P>
<P>Here their Houses are two or three Stories high with Galleries; the middle of the House lying always open, with Rooms on each side, having high and broad Doors, furnish'd to the whole Length with a great Press or Chest of Drawers, in which they lay up their Habits, or what ever else they have a great esteem for.</P>
<P>The Galleries rest upon <HI>Pilasters</HI> made either of Brick or Marble, painted and varnished over after the manner of a <HI>Piazza</HI> or <HI>Terrast-Walk.</HI></P>
<P>Many Houses have Stone Cisterns, ten or twelve Cubits long, six or seven broad, and six or seven Foot deep, handsomely painted and varnished over, under which stands a Marble Trough, receiving the redundant Water of the Cistern. They are kept pure and clean, though never kept cover'd, but in Summer when Men, Women, and Children bathe in it.</P>
<P>The Houses have also commonly peculiar Turrets, something elevated from the rest, in which when they go abroad they secure their Wives; who to pass the time with more content, from thence have a full Survey of the whole City.</P>
<P>Of the seven hundred <HI>Mosques</HI> there,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Churches.</NOTE> above half a hundred are very spacious, and of great Reception, and stately built on Marble Pillars, mingled with Stone Fountains on the Tops. They are built after the manner of our Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> vaulted with Wooden Arches; but the Floors are cover'd with matted Rush, so close and neatly joyn'd together, that the Seams can hardly be seen, nor any dust come through: And the Walls also in the same manner matted above six foot high.</P>
<P>The most Eminent <HI>Mosque</HI> in this City,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Church.</NOTE> is call'd <HI>Karuven,</HI> which <HI>Gramay</HI> says is half a Mile in Compass, with thirty <HI>Porticoes,</HI> every one of an extraordi∣nary Heighth and Breadth, with a Roof of an hundred and fifty Cubits long, and eighty Cubits broad. The Tower or Steeple of it, whence they daily cry aloud, and set up certain Flags to give notice to call the people to the <HI>Sala,</HI> or their Divine Service, is exceeding high, and being built not Square, but Qua∣drangular
<PB N="189" REF="128"/><HI>Oblongo,</HI> stands supported in Breadth with twenty, and in Length with thirty Marble Pillars; under which are always above four hundred Vessels of Water to wash in before Prayers: Round about stand several Cloi∣sters, each of forty Cubits in Length, and thirty in Breadth, wherein all sorts of Church Utensils, as Oyl, Lamps, and Mats, are kept. There are in that Church above nine hundred Arches with Marble Pillars, at each of which hangs a lighted Lamp.</P>
<P>About a Mile from hence lieth <HI>New-Fez,</HI> a glorious Structure,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-Fez.</NOTE> built by one <HI>Jacob,</HI> son of the First <HI>Abdullach,</HI> of the <HI>Marine</HI> Family, in a rich and delightful Plain; one Arm of the River on the Northside runs into the City, and the other makes its Entry on the Southside, taking a view of the Castle, and the Colledge of King <HI>Abuhinam,</HI> who nam'd it, <HI>The White City;</HI> but the common People, <HI>New-Fez:</HI> Founded at the first onely to be the nearer to the King of <HI>Telesin,</HI> who at the beginning of his Reign had been his great Enemy.</P>
<P>He divided it into three parts; the first allotted to be the Kings Palace,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It was divided into three Parts.</NOTE> and a Residence for the Children and Brothers of the King; wherein were con∣tained many Gardens, stately <HI>Mosques,</HI> and Chambers for Accounts and Re∣ceipts of the Revenue: Round about were Mansions for Artificers; in the midst Dwellings for Receivers, Treasurers, Labourers, Notaries, Accom∣ptants, and Secretaries. Near the Treasury-Chamber was the Goldsmiths Row, and other Conveniences for the Assay-Master, and Master of the Mint.</P>
<P>The second Part he set out for a Palace for his Courtiers, Officers, and chief Men, contain'd within a Line of Fifteen hundred Paces, from East to West, and adjoyning to a Market, set round about with Shops of Merchants and Artificers. The third Part was at first the Quarters of the Kings Life-Guard, but now is for the most part Inhabited by <HI>Jews</HI> and Goldsmiths.</P>
<P>This New City hath no fewer <HI>Mosques,</HI> Baths, and Colledges, than the Old. Here is an ingenious Water-Work, the Invention of a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> having many great Wheeles, each of which turn but once round in four and twenty Hours, and convey Water out of the River into Cisterns, from whence again through Leaden-Pipes, the Palaces, Gardens, <HI>Mosques,</HI> Baths and Colledges are all plentifully served.</P>
<P>This City was brought to full Perfection in an Hundred and forty Years, being environ'd with strong Walls, and accommodated with Conveniences and Ornaments fit for a City, except the fore-mentioned Water-Work, which it had not of divers Years after, being only contented with Water brought thi∣ther from a Spring, ten Miles distant through Pipes, by the contrivance of a <HI>Genoese.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Mountains of this Province are, <HI>Zalagh, Zarhon, Tagat,</HI> and <HI>Gereygure. Zalagh</HI> somewhat more than half a Mile distant from <HI>Fez</HI> Northward,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mountains of <HI>Fez.</HI></NOTE> beginneth on the East-side of the River <HI>Subu,</HI> and extending four Miles West∣ward on which is scituate <HI>Lampte</HI> a fair Town, supposed by <HI>Marmol</HI> to be the <HI>Bobrise</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zarhou,</HI> call'd by the Inhabitants, <HI>Zarahanum,</HI> appearing first in the Plains of <HI>Eceis</HI> or <HI>Aseis,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Fez,</HI> and stretching eight Miles Westward. It is properly under the Jurisdiction of <HI>Mequinez,</HI> and contains forty Hamlets or Vil∣lages; lying among the Green Olive-Trees, wherewith it is every where abundantly shadowed.</P>
<PB N="190" REF="129"/>
<P><HI>Titulit</HI> standing on the top of it, was formerly the Chief City of this Ter∣ritory, two Miles in Compass; but by King <HI>Joseph,</HI> of the Race of the <HI>Almo∣raviden,</HI> utterly destroyed, and hath ever since remain'd waste, only that fif∣teen or twenty <HI>Alsakues</HI> or Priests reside there, in so many Houses standing about the <HI>Mosque.</HI> Some report, there yet remains a City, commonly call'd, <HI>Elkazar-Pharon,</HI> that is, <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s <HI>Palace;</HI> but by Geographers, <HI>Kazar Zaraha∣num,</HI> being three Miles from <HI>Titulit,</HI> with a small River on each side, and sha∣dowed round about with Groves of Olive. This City was ruined the same time with <HI>Titulit,</HI> there being at present no other Remainder of it, but a Market-place call'd <HI>Larbaa el Haibar,</HI> frequented every Wednesday by the Peo∣ple of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Mequinez.</HI> But <HI>Dar el Hamare,</HI> which <HI>Marmol</HI> thinks is <HI>The Epitiane of Ptolomy,</HI> stands here yet without any injury, and well Peopl'd, though the Inhabitants are mightily terrifi'd with Lions, coming thither frequently to seek Prey.</P>
<P>At the Foot of this Mountain, near the way from <HI>Mequinez</HI> to <HI>Fez,</HI> appear the Ruines of <HI>Gemae,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Gotiane,</HI> destroyed by King <HI>Abu-saiid,</HI> of the <HI>Benimerin</HI> Race.</P>
<P><HI>Tagat</HI> or <HI>Togat,</HI> two Miles West from <HI>Fez,</HI> and extending from West to East two Miles, as far as the River <HI>Bu Nacer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Guerygure</HI> is very populous, close to <HI>Atlas,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Fez,</HI> between the Plains of <HI>Eceis</HI> and <HI>Adhasen:</HI> Here rises the Head of the River <HI>Aguber,</HI> that after a short Western Course joyns with the Stream <HI>Beber.</HI></P>
<P>¶ IN this Province also, six Miles from <HI>Fez,</HI> lie the Plains of <HI>Eceis</HI> or <HI>Aseis,</HI> full of Villages and Inhabitants, and <HI>Beniguarten Vale,</HI> containing about two hundred Residences of the <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P>This Jurisdiction produceth great abundance of Grain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quality of the Soil of the Territory of <HI>Fez.</HI></NOTE> Cotton, and Flax, even to admiration; as also variety of Fruits, especially Figs, Almonds, O∣lives, and large Grapes; Horses, Camels, Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Deer, and Hares breed here in great numbers: But this Plenty of all Necessaries is at∣tended with a great Inconvenience; for the Air of the Countrey ten Miles in Length, and five in Breadth, Westward from <HI>Old Fez,</HI> is infectious and un∣healthful, causing in the Inhabitants a pale yellow Colour, and casting them into malignant and other mortal Diseases.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey is full of Gardens, wherein grows Flax, Melons, Ci∣trons, Beets, Herbs, and all sorts of such Plants in such vaste quantities, that it is said, that the Gardeners in Summer bring five thousand Waggons with Fruit and Herbs to Market, and little less in Winter. The Soyl is so rich, that they plough it not, but only sprinkle it in <HI>May</HI> with Watering-pots; with which small cost and pains it produces infinite variety of Fruits, very delightful in taste, onely the Peaches are waterish, and not very well relishing.</P>
<P>Besides this Fertility of the Land, the Rivers are wonderously stor'd with Fish of divers kinds, especially that by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd <HI>Sabalos.</HI></P>
<P>The Land about <HI>Salee</HI> produceth multitudes of Box-Trees, and other Wood, whereof the Inhabitants make Combs. Much Cotton also, but little Grain, by reason of the Sandiness of the Soyl.</P>
<P>The Countrey about <HI>Mahmore</HI> is on one side shadow'd with stately Oaks; but the other affords excellent Pasture for Cattel, abundance of Oranges, but Dates beyond imagination. There are also very large Oxen, and besides Goats, Hens, Partridges, Pigeons, and other tame and useful Creatures.</P>

<P>The Woods breed the strongest and fiercest Lions in all <HI>Africa,</HI> to the great annoyance of the People: Nor do they want good Honey and Sugar-Canes, in the use whereof they were ignorant, till the <HI>Moors</HI> banisht out of <HI>Spain</HI> taught them how to extract it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> Countrey produceth many excellent Fruits, especially great Quinces, Granates, White and Damask Plumbs, large Figs, Grapes, which they eat fresh gather'd, Peaches, and abundance of Olives and Flax.</P>
<P>Upon Mount <HI>Zalagh</HI> grow Vines, yielding singular sweet and delicious Raisins.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Zarhonne</HI> is cover'd with Olive-Trees, that afar off it seems to be a Wood.</P>
<P><HI>Tefelfelt</HI> stands among Woods, wherein many fierce Lions frequent. In the Plains of <HI>Aseis</HI> or <HI>Adhasen,</HI> the Lions are so timerous, that a man, nay a very woman, will either by chiding or blows make them flie.</P>
<P>The Diet of the Inhabitants of <HI>Fez,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> agrees with that of all other <HI>Mahume∣tan</HI> People of <HI>Barbary,</HI> making three Meals a day: For Breakfast, they eat a little Fruit and Bread, with thin Pap made of Meal; but in Winter, Sops made in the Broth of Salt Flesh, such as we in <HI>England</HI> usually call <HI>Brewis.</HI> At Dinner, they have in Summer Flesh with Sallets of Lettice or Cabbadge, Cheese, Olives, and Melon-Broth. At Supper, nothing but Bread with Me∣lons, or Raisins, or Milk; but in the Winter, boyl'd Flesh with <HI>Couscous,</HI> but seldom Roast-meat. This is the ordinary Fare of common Citizens; but Persons of State or Quality have many additional Delicacies. The Tables are low, without Table-Clothes or Knives, pulling their Meat in pieces with their Fingers. They put Flesh and Pottage in the same Dish, out of which every one may take what he pleases. They never drink till they have done eating, and then conclude their Meal with it.</P>
<P>The Men of <HI>Fez</HI> that have any Estate, wear a Habit in the Winter,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of the Men of <HI>Fez.</HI></NOTE> made of Foreign Cloth; over that a Cassock or Tunick with short Sleeves; and over all another large Cloak, clasped before upon the Breast; and on their
<PB N="192" REF="130"/>Heads they put Caps like Night-coifs. The poorer sort wear a loose Jacket, with a Mantle over it, and slight Quoives on their Heads.</P>
<P>The Women also go fashionably clad,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of the Women.</NOTE> wearing in Summer a Shift onely; but in Winter a Coat with wide Sleeves: When they go abroad, they put on long Drawers that reach to their Knees, then throw over their Heads a Cloth that covers them all over, and a Mask. The better sort wear Gold Ear-Rings with precious Stones and Jewels; but the meaner content themselves with Silver ones without Jewels. On their Arms and Legs they wear Chains also, and a peculiar sort of Slippers fasten'd on with Silk Bands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabs</HI> living thereabouts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of the <HI>Arabi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> commonly wear a Garment which they call <HI>Baraguan,</HI> wrapt about their body, and a red Bonnet. All the rest go naked, onely one Clout girt about their Waste, and hanging down almost to the Knees.</P>
<P>¶ THe Government of <HI>Fez</HI> is Monarchical,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Government.</NOTE> heretofore call'd <HI>Cheriffs;</HI> but now <HI>Kings,</HI> who are very potent. But neither they nor any other <HI>Ma∣humetan</HI> Kings use either Scepter, Crown, or Throne, but onely a low Seat co∣ver'd over with Cloth of Gold, and a Cushion set with Pearls and precious Stones.</P>
<P>When the King perceiveth,

<P>In <HI>Fez,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">People of several Coun∣treys in <HI>Fez.</HI></NOTE> People of all Countreys reside; as <HI>English, French, Hollanders, Tar∣tars, Persians,</HI> and <HI>Eastern Greeks,</HI> each of them having a Consul there to man∣nage the business of Merchandise: But the common Inhabitants are <HI>Moors,</HI> the Offspring of those formerly banisht out of <HI>Spain,</HI> as we declar'd before.</P>

The first are noble in Bloud, as descended from Honor∣able Ancestors; others become Noble by Offices and Employment; the third are so esteem'd for their great Wealth and Riches: but all enjoy the same and equal Priviledges. They are very proud and disdainful both in their Speech and Behaviour towards Strangers, but according to their Obligations with∣out any reluctancy, attend the King in his Wars. In this one City, they say there are above three thousand Noble Families.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Jews</HI> are numerous not onely in <HI>Fez,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Religion.</NOTE> but spread through the whole Kingdom, where it is suppos'd they amount to eight hundred thousand.

<P>The Inhabitants are either <HI>Mahumetans,

The Streets are narrow, crooked, and without order; the Houses also mean and scattering: yet surrounded with indifferent handsom and high Walls, but the Haven very incommodious, especially as to some Winds.</P>
<P>In the most flourishing time the Inhabitants reckoned six thousand Houses, besides Temples, Hospitals, Baths, and Inns. Most of the Citizens were <HI>Weavers,</HI> others lived of their yearly Revenues, which they raised from their Sale of Barley; the adjacent Countrey yielding little Rye or Wheat. Many Merchants arrived hither from <HI>Catalonia, Genoa, Venice,</HI> and other Places, who drove a great Trade with the Citizens, whose deportment towards them was very courteous and friendly.</P>
<P>They held Wars a long time with the King of <HI>Telensin,</HI> who would have im∣posed on them a Governour, which they would never admit, but among themselves chose a Magistrate, whom they impowered to decide all differen∣ces arising, and was the Judge in all criminal Causes, either as to Life or Death. By this means, and their unity among themselves, they became at length so powerful, that at their own Cost they maintained a Fleet, with which they Pillaged upon all the Coasts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and became as it were a Pri∣son of Captive Christians: This so provoked the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that he sent an Army thither, under the Command and Conduct of the Cardinal of <HI>Spain, Francis Ximenes;</HI> which, with the help of the <HI>Biscayners,</HI> in the Year Five hun∣dred and nine, the Eighth day of <HI>May,</HI> with the Loss onely of thirty men, and the Redemption of twenty thousand Christian Slaves, took it, and much defa∣ced its former Lustre; yet still there is a stately Palace, the Residence of the Kings Lieutenant, a Council-House, Exchange, great Church, and several rich Hospitals.</P>
<P>Here are two other little Cities, call'd by <HI>Gramay, Aghard,</HI> and <HI>Agbal;</HI> be∣sides <HI>Mazagran</HI> and <HI>Mastagan,</HI> both possessed by the <HI>Turks,</HI> together with the Mountain <HI>Magarava.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Mazagran</HI> hath a Haven, the same as <HI>Marmol</HI> thinks which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> named the Haven of the <HI>Gothes,</HI> and is environed with high Walls, and both strengthen∣ed and beautified with a great Castle.</P>
<P><HI>Mostagan,</HI> by <HI>Sanutus</HI> and others call'd <HI>Mestugam;</HI> by some taken for <HI>Cartena,</HI> but by others for the <HI>Trada</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> by the Sea side, nine miles Eastward of <HI>Horan,</HI> and one small mile from <HI>Mazagran.</HI> It contains fifteen hundred Houses, a fair Church, a convenient Haven, and on the South side a strong Castle.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Magarava,</HI> extending Nine Miles in length upon the Sea-Coast, part∣eth <HI>Tremecen</HI> and <HI>Tenez</HI> one from another, takes its Name from the <HI>Magaravaes,</HI> a People so called, that Inhabit there; at whose feet stand both the former Towns.</P>
<P>About <HI>Mostagan</HI> the Land is very Rich and Fruitful, but lieth waste and un∣inhabited, by the continual Thieveries of the <HI>Arabs:</HI> and <HI>Magarava</HI> breeds many Cattel, and yields good store of Wheat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mazagrans</HI> are untoward,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Employment.</NOTE> and ill-conditioned, being for the most part Shepherds; but the <HI>Magaravaes</HI> are Warlike, and of a haughty Courage, not li∣ving in Houses, but like the wild <HI>Arabians,</HI> removing from place to place with their Cattel: Their Language broken <HI>Arabick,</HI> and their Lives spent without any certain order; onely for convenience sake, they pay to <HI>Algier</HI> an Annual Tribute of Twelve thousand Escues, or <HI>French</HI> Crowns.</P>
<P>A Mile Westward of <HI>Horan,</HI> by the side of a little Bay, stands <HI>Marzalquibir,</HI> thought to be the place which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calleth <HI>The Great Haven,</HI> and placed in <HI>Mauritania Caesariensis;</HI> nor is the Opinion without great shew of Reason, for that <HI>Marzalquibir,</HI>

<P>The Cities lying within its Verge, are <HI>Algier, Metafuz, Teddelez</HI> or <HI>Teddel, Col der Medujaren, Sasa, Medua,</HI> and lastly <HI>Kouko.</HI></P>
<P>By whom and when this City was built, formerly the Head of <HI>Mauritania,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Algler.</HI> When built.</NOTE> and in the time of King <HI>Juba,</HI> his Royal Seat remains obscure; although some have conceited it to be the Antient <HI>Salde;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Antient Names.</NOTE> Mercator</HI> with some reason gues∣ses it to have been <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy, Julia Caesariensis:</HI> Whose History we will give with as much truth as Antiquity or History will afford.</P>
<P>History records to this purpose; That after the Death of this King, his Son having been taken and led in Triumph to <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> did testifie so great a moderation in the disaster of his Captivity, that he won the hearts of the <HI>Romans</HI> by the high Fame of his Worth and incomparable Vertues; which was the cause why <HI>Augustus,</HI> succeeding <HI>Julius,</HI> restor'd to that young Prince the Liberty which he had lost, and gave him the Dominions of his Father: So that by way of acknowledgement of so great a Favor from <HI>Augustus,</HI> having wholly new built this which was then call'd <HI>Jol,</HI> he order'd to be added to it the Word <HI>Caesaria;</HI> upon which it hath ever since been call'd <HI>Jol,</HI> or <HI>Julia Caesaria,</HI> as may be seen by certain Medals of <HI>Claudius</HI> and <HI>Anto∣ninus.</HI></P>
<P>Now that <HI>Algier</HI> is the same City which the Antients call'd <HI>Jol,</HI> appeareth manifestly; inasmuch as the Descriptions which the old Geographers made thereof, are not to be verisi'd in any other City of <HI>Barbary,</HI> save this alone. Others have been pleas'd to affirm also, that it was at first call'd <HI>Mesgrana.</HI> But this seems to me altogether improbable, in regard that neither <HI>Strabo</HI> nor
<PB N="220" REF="151"/><HI>Ptolomy,</HI> nor the other Authors who have been curious in Geographical Enqui∣ries, do not speak any thing thereof, nor of any such People. However, of all the Names that it may have had heretofore, that of <HI>Algier</HI> is onely re∣maining at this day; which happen'd in this fashion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sarazens</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> coming to act their Robberies in <HI>Africa,</HI> landed there in sundry places, like so many impetuous Torrents, and there committed un∣speakable outrages. Besides this, as if in imitation of the <HI>Goths,</HI> they had ta∣ken pleasure wholly to ruine what ever published the Grandure and Magnifi∣cence of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, having observ'd that this Name of <HI>Julia Caesaria</HI> was an apparent mark thereof; and yet not desiring to destroy this City, they resolv'd to change its Name. They call'd it therefore <HI>Algezair,</HI> which in the <HI>Arabick</HI> signifieth <HI>An Island,</HI> because it is scituated near unto a small Island, where the Mole of its Port is at this day, the Sea washing its Walls on the North-side. And this Name hath ever since continu'd; but yet it hath been several ways corrupted; some calling it <HI>Algier,</HI> and others <HI>Argier,</HI> or <HI>Argel.</HI></P>
<P>¶ ALthough its Soil be for the most part Mountainous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Soil.</NOTE> yet is it notwith∣standing good and fertile, as well in its Valleys, as all along the Sea-Coasts. You there may see very fine Gardens, and Vineyards also which the <HI>Moorisks</HI> have there Planted: Insomuch, that for eight or ten Leagues round, there are counted above eighteen thousand Gardens, which are as it were so many Farms, which are call'd in <HI>Lingua Franca, Maceries,</HI> in which are kept great numbers of Slaves to Cultivate the Land, and keep their Cattel.</P>
<P>This Town,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Houses.</NOTE> which hath all its Houses whited with Chalk or Plaister within and without, maketh a very fine shew to such as approach unto it by Sea: For it presents it self unto the view insensible, as it were by certain steps, and groweth higher and higher, in manner of an <HI>Amphitheater;</HI> the rea∣son of which is, because it being upon the side of a little Hill, exposeth all its Houses to the open view with Terrass Roofs; from the top of which they have the pleasure to behold the Sea, one House not hindering the Prospect of another. Now although it be of a square Figure, yet it seemeth much less above than below; which happeneth according to the Rules of Perspective, by reason of the defect of the Sight, which determines in the Pyramidal Form.</P>
<P>Its Streets are for the most part so narrow,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Streets.</NOTE> that two men can scarce go a∣breast in them; yet we must except those that are adjacent to the Gates of the City. They make them thus narrow, that they may be the more cool, for that the heat is there very violent. The Houses are but of one Story, all built of Brick and Clay, but plaister'd and washed over with Chalk; having on the outside neither beauty, nor order of Architecture, yet they are for all that very handsome within. They are most commonly pav'd with little Bricks of sundry colour'd Clay, laid in fashion of <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work. There are four Galleries above and below, with a Court in the midst. The Cham∣bers are broader than they are long, and let in Light onely at the Doors, which are very large, and all of the full Heighth of the Room from Floor to Cieling. 'Tis true, those that are adjoyning to the Street, have some kind of Windows. They have very few of them any Gardens, and are all very close, that being the Form of Building in all the Cities of <HI>Barbary</HI> Pyrates.</P>
<PB N="221" REF="151"/>
<P>The most goodly House in <HI>Algier,</HI> is that of the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> or Vice-Roy,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Building.</NOTE> which is almost in the midst of the City, and onely remarkable for two small Galleries, one over the other, supported by a double Row of Columns of Marble and Porphyry, with some Enrichments of <HI>Mosaick</HI> Work. There are likewise two Courts, the one more spacious than the other, encompassed with Galleries, where the <HI>Divan</HI> sits every Saturday, (at the entrance of the <HI>Alcassaw</HI>) Sunday, Munday, and Tuesday.</P>
<P>There are also nine other Houses of note, which they call <HI>Casseria's,</HI> or <HI>Funduca's.</HI> The <HI>Janizaries,</HI> to whom they serve as Lodgings, have one Cham∣ber betwixt every eight of them: And though they be many in number, yet they are so cleanly, that in all their Apartments one shall not see any thing that is offensive. Indeed it is true, that there be several Slaves of the <HI>Divan</HI> appointed to take care to keep them cleanly; besides the <HI>Turks</HI> have this pe∣culiar to them, of being very neat in their Houses. Besides those above-nam'd, there be six others of considerable bigness, which they call <HI>Bagna</HI>'s, which are the Prisons in which they keep up the <HI>Christian</HI> Slaves. He that would make a near compute of all the Houses of <HI>Algier,</HI> shall finde at least Fifteen thou∣sand, which are, as I said before, all very close, and sometimes contain in one of them five or six Families.</P>
<P>Many have affirmed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Houses and Inhabitants.</NOTE> that this City containeth an hundred thousand In∣habitants, accounting Natural <HI>Turks, Moors, Janizaries, Slaves,</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> Of these last there may be about nine or ten thousand, to whom it is permitted to have their Synagogues, and a free Exercise of their Religion. And yet for all that, they are no better used there, than in all the Parts of Christendom: For besides the Imposts charged upon them, it's permitted to every one, yea and to the Christians themselves, to offer them a thousand Affronts. They are distinguish'd from other men by a Bonnet which they are oblig'd to wear, and which ought to be black, as also all the rest of their Clothes.</P>
<P>The Circuit of the City is about, by the Walls,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compast.</NOTE> three thousand four hundred Paces; in which Inclosure there are sundry <HI>Mosques,</HI> in which they make their <HI>Sala:</HI> the principal of which is that which stands along by <HI>Yessall,</HI> near to the Sea, which they call <HI>The Great Mosque,</HI> although it have not in it any thing remarkable more than the rest.</P>
<P>As to Inns, they have none amongst them;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Inns.</NOTE> so that the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Moors</HI> which come thither, must of necessity lodge with some one of their Acquain∣tance. But if there come thither any Free Christians, or Merchants, they can∣not take Lodgings in the Houses of <HI>Turks;</HI> but in those of the <HI>Jews</HI> they may, who have their Quarters assign'd them apart in the City; and amongst whom there be always some which keep Chambers to that purpose, unless that such Merchants, to be the more private, do chuse rather to take an House in the City; which is permitted them to do, in what Quarter they like best.</P>
<P>But in stead of these Inns,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But Taverns, and by whom they are kept.</NOTE> there are a great number of Taverns and Tip∣pling Houses, which are not lawful to be kept by any save Christian Ca∣ptives. In these are ordinarily sold Bread, Wine, and Victuals of all kinds. Thither flock the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Renegates</HI> of all sorts, there to make their De∣bauches. And although the use of Wine be very strictly forbidden them by their Law, yet they do not in the least scruple to violate it; and there do very few Evenings pass, in which you shall not see some one or more of them drunk; who carry themselves to such Christians as they meet in that humor, with insolence, and often strike, and most commonly wound them.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>There are usually six Gates open, and others shut.</P>
<P>The first is that of <HI>Babason,</HI> which is towards the East: In its Sub∣urbs, which is very small, are wont to lodge the Merchant-<HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabs,</HI> which bring Provisions to the City. It was on this side that <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth batter'd and besieg'd it. There they put the <HI>Turks</HI> to death; and you at all times see one or other that is there empal'd, or gauched, as they call it, and set upon the Walls, as we shall shew more at large by and by.</P>
<P>The second, which they call <HI>Porto-novo,</HI> is of the same side, by which one passeth to <HI>Castello del Imperador.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the Gate of the <HI>Alcassaw,</HI> so call'd, for that it is near unto that Palace, which is as it were the <HI>Arcenal</HI> and Magazine, wherein they keep all their Ammunition of War.</P>
<P>The fourth is that call'd <HI>Babalowetta,</HI> which looks towards the West. Be∣fore this Gate there is a place which these <HI>Barbarians</HI> have appointed for the putting of <HI>Christians</HI> to death; many of which have, and still do there receive the Crown of Martyrdom, chusing rather to suffer all imaginable Torments, than to renounce the Profession of the true God, to embrace the Impieties of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And this is the onely place of the City where they are put to death. Without this Gate is the <HI>Turks</HI> Cemetery, or Burying-place, which is about a League in Compass; at the end of which, inclining towards the Sea, is that of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and fast by, that of the <HI>Christians,</HI> which the Sea doth often wash with its Waves.</P>
<P>The fifth is the <HI>Porta della Mole,</HI> so call'd, for that it looks directly upon it. This Mole is a great Mass of Stones in the Form of an Half-Moon; the Breadth is about six or seven Paces, and its Length above three hundred. This egregious Structure giveth shape to the Port, where there are usually above an hundred Vessels for Piracy, and others. It is so unsecure in <HI>Autumn</HI> and <HI>Winter,</HI> by reason of an East and by North Winde, that in the Year One thou∣sand six hundred and nineteen, there were twenty five Vessels rackt in one
<PB N="223" REF="152"/>day. This is also call'd the <HI>Porta della Dogana,</HI> because that there the Customs are wont to be paid.</P>
<P>The sixth and last Gate is towards the Sea-side, directly opposite to the <HI>Arsenal</HI> of the Shipping, and is call'd in <HI>la Lingua Franca, La Porta della Piscade∣ria.</HI> Where it is to be noted, that in some of these Gates there be always three or four <HI>Turks</HI> for a Guard, with great staffs in their hands, which they do not seldom lay upon the shoulders of the poor Slaves, when they pass that way, which they most commonly do in sport, but out of a malicious fancy.</P>
<P>There are reckon'd at this day above an hundred Fountains in the City of <HI>Algier,</HI> that have been erected within this twenty five years onely; whereas before they had none but Cisterns. A <HI>Morisco</HI> nam'd <HI>Padron Moussa,</HI> of the Race of those who were expell'd <HI>Spain,</HI> in the Year One thousand six hundred and ten, and One thousand six hundred and eleven, did make them by means of an <HI>Aquaeduct,</HI> which was brought two Leagues from without the City. 'Tis easie to believe, that this Work cost much Sweat and Toil to the poor <HI>Christian</HI> Slaves, that wrought in the same without intermission during the most violent Heats, as they daily do now in making the Mole of the Port.</P>
<P>The Walls of the City are reasonable good, part of Brick,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Walls.</NOTE> and part of Stone, with square Towers, and certain Bastions, of which the best are to∣wards the <HI>Babason Gate,</HI> where there be deep Trenches; and towards the Sea∣side, the Wall stands upon a Rock, against which the Waves beat.</P>
<P>I come next to the Fortresses of the City, which are a considerable num∣ber, all built regularly according to the Art of Modern Fortifications.</P>
<P>¶ THe first is on the East-side, flanked at the top of a Mountain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fortresses.</NOTE> from whence one may greatly incommode the Town, and batter it to pieces. It's call'd <HI>Castello del' Imperador,</HI> for that <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, having laid Siege to <HI>Algier</HI> in the Year One thousand five hundred forty and one, of which we shall speak hereafter, did there begin that Fort, which the Inhabitants af∣terwards finished. In the state wherein it is at this day, it serves the Town for a <HI>Cittadel,</HI> in which there is commonly a Garrison of an Hundred Men, with sundry Pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>The second is call'd <HI>Castel-novo,</HI> or <HI>The Seven-corner'd Castle;</HI> for that it con∣sists of six Angles. This Fortress is betwixt the Town and <HI>Castel del' Impera∣dor,</HI> towards the South, about five hundred Paces distant from the City.</P>
<P>The third is the <HI>Alcassaw,</HI> which is of a very great Extent within the City, and makes a part of the Wall betwixt the East and South.</P>
<P>The fourth is on the West, three hundred Paces without <HI>Porta Babalowetta,</HI> flanked upon the point of a little Rock towards the Sea.</P>
<P>The fifth is a good Bulwark, but small, close by the <HI>Porta della Mole,</HI> to∣wards the Great <HI>Cassaria.</HI> In it are observable five great Field-Pieces, which on the side towards the Sea defend the Port; but above all, there is in this Fort a very fine Canon of seven Cylinders or Bores, which serveth to com∣mand the Entry of the Gate.</P>
<P>The sixth is a little Island upon Piles in the midst of the Mole.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Haven and Mold.</NOTE> It is a <HI>Pentagon,</HI> or a Figure of Five Angles, in form of a Tower, in the top of which are five great Guns for the Defence of the said Mole.</P>
<PB N="224" REF="153"/>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The seventh is a little Tower at the entrance of the said Port, towards the Mouth of the Mole, wherein a Guard is kept, and in which for the use of the Navigators, a great Lanthorn is sometimes plac'd a nights. It is kept by eight <HI>Moors,</HI> who stand Centinel along the Mole, and by a dozen more that lye at the Entry thereof in a Boat.</P>
<P>There are planted upon this Mole Sixty six Pieces of Cannon, small and great; and are kept there onely for a remembrance of the Victory which they of <HI>Algier</HI> obtain'd over those of <HI>Tunis,</HI> when in the Year One thousand six hundred twenty seven, they defeated their <HI>Armado,</HI> at which they became Masters of these Guns. Amongst them all, there be four small ones very ex∣cellent, two of which belong'd to <HI>Simon Dancer,</HI> a notorious <HI>Flemish</HI> Pyrate.</P>
<P>¶ NOw although that this City have all the Fortresses which we have na∣med,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guards.</NOTE> yet it is for all that to be commanded on all sides, except on that towards the Sea; for that there be sundry Hills and Mountains from whence it may be beaten to dust. The Garrisons which are put into them, are onely design'd for the Guard of the City. Besides this, the <HI>Meswar,</HI> or Executioner follow'd by sundry Assistants, doth constantly each night walk the Round, and the Patroul thorow all the many Streets: And as for the lesser, they are for the most part shut up so soon as night begins to approach. And if the <HI>Meswar</HI> meeteth any one whose excuse seemeth not to him satis∣factory, he presently seizeth on him, and carrieth him to Prison. The next day he giveth an account thereof to the <HI>Divan,</HI> or to the <HI>Cadie:</HI> And if the Pri∣soner be so unfortunate that he cannot appease the Judge with reasons, or take off the <HI>Meswar</HI> with Money, this accident will cost him sometimes two hun∣dred Blows of a Cudgel; which there is no way to avoid but by emptying of his Purse: for the truth is, that there, as well as in other places, Gold and Silver are powerful Charms.</P>
<PB N="225" REF="153"/>
<P>¶ IN <HI>Algier, Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Sally,</HI> and the other Pyratick Towns of <HI>Barbary,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Language.</NOTE> three different kinds of Languages are spoken. The first is the <HI>Arabick,</HI> or <HI>Morisk,</HI> which is that of the Countrey. The second is the <HI>Turkish,</HI> which hath no∣thing of resemblance with those of the <HI>Arabs</HI> or <HI>Moors.</HI> And the third is that they call <HI>La Franca,</HI> which is commonly used to make ones self understood; which is a kind of easie and pleasant <HI>Jargon,</HI> compounded of <HI>French, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Spanish.</HI></P>
<P>Each Nation that keepeth an Ambassadour at the Port of the <HI>Grand Sei∣gnior,</HI> hath a Consul at this City, by whom the Differences are determined that may arise betwixt the People of his Nation. He likewise keeps his Chan∣cellor with the Kings Seal; and in this Chancery are those Acts and Businesses ratifi'd which those of that Nation do Transact among themselves. Which is done for Paying Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> which the Consul hath power to take upon all the Merchandises of the People of his Nation that come thither to Trade. But then he is to secure them at his own Charges, from all the Frauds and Exacti∣ons that the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> may chance to offer them. And the same is pra∣ctised in all the other Pyratick Towns.</P>
<P>¶ WE shall now in order proceed to their <HI>Militia.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Militia.</NOTE> And though at this day the <HI>Janizaries</HI> have the whole Command in <HI>Algier,</HI> yet that man∣ner of Government hath not been always such: for at the time of <HI>Ariadin, Bar∣barossa</HI> made himself Master of the City, and that his Brother <HI>Cheridine</HI> succeeded him, they both Commanded absolutely: but that form of Rule did change amongst the People of <HI>Algier</HI> after that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> began to send them <HI>Bashaws,</HI> or Governours: whence it happens sometimes, that this <HI>Militia</HI> flying into Revolts, have set up some, and driven out others; to which the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> hath not thought fit to give a check, for fear of exasperating them, and wholly diverting them from his Obedience. And this is the reason why he, being well acquainted with the Disposition of that People, and the trou∣bles that they may procure unto himself, if he should use any Violence against them, contents himself to send thither in his Name a <HI>Bashaw</HI> that represents his Person, and who onely takes care that nothing be transacted to the disser∣vice of his Highness.</P>
<P>Whereby you may see that this <HI>Bashaw,</HI> or <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> hath all the Honours of State, reserving the Government. And thus the <HI>Militia</HI> hath insensibly usurped the Soveraign Authority in <HI>Algier:</HI> for how considerable soever the <HI>Bashaw</HI> is, he can conclude upon nothing without the advice of the Comman∣ders of that <HI>Militia,</HI> nor so much as go to the <HI>Divan</HI> unless he be sent for.</P>
<P>Upon the whole one may affirm,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is that goodly Mo∣del of Government which our <HI>English Janizaries,</HI> or <HI>Mussulmans</HI> introduced a∣mongst us in the Winter of <HI>Anno</HI> 1659.</NOTE> that this is at this day a State that Apes a Soveraign, whereas the other <HI>Bashaws</HI> and <HI>Beglerbegs,</HI> which Command in the Provinces of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire (excepting, besides this, those also of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Tripoly</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> Pyratical Cities) are absolute over the <HI>Janizaries.</HI> But ever since that the <HI>Militia</HI> of <HI>Algier</HI> is put in possession of the Sove∣raign Authority, nothing doth pass without the express Order of it, which in the Declarations and Edicts it sends forth, doth always speak in these Terms of high Preheminence:
<Q><HI>WE the Great and Small, the Puissant and Invincible</HI> Militia <HI>of</HI> Algier, <HI>and of its whole Realm, have Determined and Resolved.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But the better to understand what concerns this <HI>Militia,</HI> I do think fit to
<PB N="226" REF="154"/>speak of it first in particular, untill we come to speak of its <HI>Divan</HI> and Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>When I consider this <HI>Militia,</HI> I fancy it to be like unto a Basilisk, which Nature hath crowned for the King of Serpents, but whose Looks are conta∣gious and mortal. Even so doth this Monster carry Death in its Eyes, so dan∣gerous is it to all those whom it intends to hurt; and it is onely its violence that hath put the Crown upon its Head.</P>
<P>It consists of Twenty two thousand Men; of which some are Natural <HI>Turks</HI> of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and Sons of <HI>Turks,</HI> which they call <HI>Couloys,</HI> and the rest Renega∣does, or Strangers, or Natives of the Place. There is a necessity of having al∣ways some Natural <HI>Turks,</HI> to the end the Advantage may be equal betwixt them and the Renegadoes, without either getting the Mastery of the other. Nevertheless the Renegadoes cannot be Souldiers, or receive Pay in the <HI>Mi∣litia,</HI> unless they be free and franck: that is, unless they have found out some means to Redeem themselves, or their Masters have conferred on them the Pri∣viledge of Freedom: which they sometimes do, when they have been well Served, or when they become Renegadoes at their solicitation: for although a Christian Captive do take the <HI>Turban,</HI> and turn <HI>Turk,</HI> yet do they not cease to be Slaves, unless he be freed by one of those ways.</P>
<P>But if it chance that there remain but few Natural <HI>Turks</HI> in this <HI>Militia,</HI> ei∣ther for that they are dead, or for that they are return'd into their Native Countrey, in such Case the new <HI>Bashaws</HI> which come from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> bring others along with them, or send for them into the <HI>Levant:</HI> insomuch, that in such Case they take the first that come; and very often the poor Shepherds, or such like, which they train up to handle Arms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> can have no Office in this <HI>Militia,</HI> thereby to prevent the suspicion that might arise, lest that being Natives of the Place, they should conspire under-hand together, to expell thence the <HI>Turks</HI> and Renegadoes, and assume the Soveraign Authority into their own hands. Nor are the <HI>Morisks,</HI> who were driven out of <HI>Spain,</HI> admitted to that Priviledge. And if there be occasion to Enroll a Man, which is most commonly done onely in <HI>Algier,</HI> it is the Custom to go and find out the <HI>Aga,</HI> who is the Chief of the <HI>Militia,</HI> or the Colonel, or the General, as also the Clerk to the <HI>Divan,</HI> who do take the Names of those that are listed, and instantly put them into Pay, which is Four <HI>Doubles</HI> a Moneth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pay.</NOTE> each <HI>Double</HI> being worth Ten <HI>Sols</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money. They have moreover each day Four Ammunition-Loaves: but if they be Married, as they may be, they have no Bread, but may dwell in the City with their Family.</P>
<P>This Pay is encreased a <HI>Double</HI> by the Moneth, as often as those who receive it are found to be in the Field gathering the <HI>Lismes</HI> or Tributes of the <HI>Moors,</HI> or that a new <HI>Bashaw</HI> doth come; and as often likewise as any Male-Child is born unto the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> And thus the said Pay mounteth, until it come to Forty <HI>Doubles</HI> the Moneth; but can never rise higher, according to the present Establishment, for any Officer whatever. And this was Enacted some years since, by reason there was not found Money enough to pay the whole <HI>Militia.</HI> From this <HI>Militia</HI> are drawn forth all the Souldiers of the Garrisons which are dispersed in the Frontier Towns of the Kingdom, which are changed every Six Moneths, and are called the <HI>Pubes;</HI> of which the Bri∣gades are composed, as hath been said above.</P>
<P>Now when the question is made about Arming a Pyrate-Ship, amongst
<PB N="227" REF="154"/>the other Souldiers, there are constantly some of this <HI>Militia,</HI> of which Three or four thousand remain in <HI>Algier</HI> for a Guard to the City, and to serve upon the occasions that may arise. As for their Quarter, it is ordinarily in Nine great Houses, which they call <HI>Casseria's,</HI> where, or elsewhere they may follow any Trade that they are skill'd in. In which doubtless, that which doth much encourage them is, that the least among them may attain when time shall serve, according to his order of reception, to be the chief Commander of this <HI>Militia;</HI> for they successively rise from Degree to Degree, and from Office to Office, until they come to the Quality of <HI>Aga:</HI> nor can any Favour, or other Consideration change this method. And because it is impossible to understand this, but by knowing the Degrees and Names of those Officers, it is requisite that I here insert them, beginning at the lowest, and ascending to the highest.</P>
<P N="1">From simple Souldiers and <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who are called <HI>Oldachy's,</HI> after a cer∣tain time, as their turn comes, they are made <HI>Biquelars,</HI> otherwise Cooks to the <HI>Divan,</HI> which is the first step to rise unto the great Offices following. These <HI>Biquelars</HI> are those that in the <HI>Casseria's,</HI> Garrisons, Camps or Armies, are to take care about providing Meat and Drink for the Officers, and principal Commanders of this <HI>Militia.</HI></P>
<P N="2">From <HI>Biquelars</HI> and Caterers they come to be <HI>Odabachy's,</HI> that is Corpo∣rals of Companies, or Commanders of Squadrons, of which the number of Souldiers is not limited; for they consist sometimes of Ten, and sometimes of Twenty. These have Six <HI>Doubles</HI> a Moneth for Pay, and expectation of having it augmented to them, as we have said already; and they wear for a mark of Honour a great Trayle of half a Foot broad, which hangeth down their Backs above a Foot in length, with two long <HI>Ostrich</HI> Feathers.</P>
<P N="3">From the Charge of <HI>Odabachy's</HI> they rise to that of <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> or Ca∣ptains, which one may know by a piece of Copper Gilt, which they wear up∣on their <HI>Turban,</HI> in fashion of a Pyramid, and a very high Plume.</P>
<P N="4">From <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> or Captains, they come to be <HI>Ajabachy's,</HI> which are but Twenty four, and are the chief of the <HI>Divan.</HI></P>
<P N="5">From the quality of <HI>Ajabachy's,</HI> they ascend to that of <HI>Aga,</HI> Commander, or Colonel-General of all the <HI>Militia.</HI> They can continue but two Moneths at the most in this Charge, and sometimes they change five or six of them in a day, when they are not judged capable thereof by the <HI>Divan:</HI> insomuch that sometimes there have been Three in a quarter of an hour. But let them be never so unfit for it, yet nevertheless the have all the honour to have presided in the <HI>Divan,</HI> although that sometimes they have not been Seated in the Chair of the <HI>Aga,</HI> nor declared such: and in that case the <HI>Bashaw</HI> is obliged to give each of them a Scarlet Vest.</P>
<P N="6">After they have past the Dignity of <HI>Aga,</HI> they hold the Quality of <HI>Mansu∣laga's,</HI> that is to say, they are such as our <HI>Veterans,</HI> called by the <HI>Romans, Emeriti Milites;</HI> for they are after that no longer obliged to the Function of Souldiers, and yet never cease as long as they live, to receive Pay, which is about Forty <HI>Doubles,</HI> which amounts to Twenty <HI>Livres</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money. But if the <HI>Divan</HI> are to chuse a Generall for the Fields, or for the Fleets, they commonly take him from amongst these <HI>Mansulaga's,</HI> for that they are Men of Experience, and well skilled in matters of War.</P>
<P>Now all that are of the <HI>Militia</HI> are so much esteemed amongst them, that they do not make any account of a Man unless he be a Souldier; although that very often the principal of those Officers be Tradesmen, as Shoemakers, Black-Smiths,
<PB N="228" REF="155"/>and the like. And there is not any one that dares to strike one of those Souldiers, unless he be one himself, and unless he will have his Hand cut off: nay its remarkable, that they are not Censurable by the <HI>Cady's,</HI> or ordinary Judges, but onely by the <HI>Aga,</HI> or his <HI>Chaia,</HI> that is, his Lieutenant.</P>
<P>The Musquet and Simiter, are the Arms which they use to carry, when they go unto the Wars, or to fetch in Contributions, or to play the Pyrates, and not otherwise. We are to adde here, that of the number of these <HI>Oldachy's,</HI> or sim∣ple <HI>Janizaries,</HI> the <HI>Aga</HI> selects Four, which they call <HI>Sotachy's,</HI> who serve for a Guard to the <HI>Bashaw:</HI> and these have their Lodgings and their Table in his Palace, and withall, these onely are allowed to wear Simiters; and that they may be distinguished from the rest, they have upon their <HI>Turbans</HI> a kind of little Tower of Gilded Copper, and a very high Plume made of <HI>Herons</HI> Feathers.</P>
<P>That which is very observable in this <HI>Militia,</HI> is, that it being compounded of a great many Men of different Nations, as namely <HI>Turks, Greeks, French, Spaniards, Italians, Flemings, English, Germans,</HI> and others; yet their Policy is for all that so good, that they all live in great Concord, and very rarely Quarrel each other. But if amongst them any one chance to lay hand on his Simiter, be it by Rencounter, or otherwise, with a design to strike, then all that be pre∣sent are obliged to make in unto him to hinder his doing any more, and to car∣ry him to the <HI>Divan</HI> to be punished.</P>
<P>I will adde here one notable passage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Instance of <HI>Barbari∣ans</HI> that reproacheth the uncharitableness of <HI>Christi∣ans.</HI></NOTE> to make it appear how much esteem these <HI>Barbarians</HI> have for all those in general who receive Pay, and are En∣rolled in this <HI>Militia.</HI> Some years since it happened, that amongst sundry Lions which were Tamed, and went up and down the Streets of <HI>Algier,</HI> there was one which entred into the Court where the <HI>Divan</HI> was sitting; and there before the whole Assembly he threw himself at the Feet of the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> and be∣gan to fawn upon him, moaning in a sorrowful Tone, as if he did complain: The <HI>Bashaw</HI> instantly guessed, that this Lion suffered hunger, and that having no particular Master, (for he was in common, and lay in the Streets) no one had took care to give him Food: whereupon, by consent of the <HI>Divan,</HI> he or∣dered, that for the time to come, that Lyon should have the Pay of a <HI>Janizary,</HI> to be employed for his sustenance: but the Lion chancing to die a Moneth af∣ter, it was Decreed in full <HI>Divan,</HI> that he should be solemnly Interred, and car∣ried by four <HI>Janizaries,</HI> in memory of that that he had been of their <HI>Militia,</HI> and received Pay as themselves.</P>
<P>¶ THe next thing is their Civil Government, their method of managing affairs of State, which is by the <HI>Bashaw</HI> and <HI>Divan;</HI> yet herein differ they from all other: for the Divine <HI>Plato</HI> speaking of the felicity of States, hath said with as much reason as truth, that they would then be happy when the Philosophers should be Kings, or Kings would Philosophate. But the State of <HI>Algier</HI> seemeth directly to oppose that Doctrine; for that those who have the Government thereof have very few of those Qualities which are re∣quired to Wisdom. And yet nevertheless, as if Fortune had taken up her dwelling in that City, she makes it to grow and prosper from day to day, both in Wealth and Power, if so be one may call that Prosperity which subsists onely by Vice, and which hath no other Foundation than Tyranny.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Government.</NOTE> to speak properly, is the Council of State, as well of the City, as of the whole Kingdom. It is composed of all the Officers of the <HI>Militia,</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="155"/>and sits four times a Week; namely, on Saturday, which is the day of the Great <HI>Divan,</HI> Sunday, Munday, and Tuesday. The first day in the <HI>Alcassaw,</HI> and the three others in the great Court of the <HI>Bashaw</HI>'s House. He himself, as great as he is, cannot be present there, unless he be sent for in the Name of the <HI>Divan,</HI> by is <HI>Chiaus,</HI> or <HI>Huishers,</HI> who go on purpose to his Lodgings to advertise him thereof; and at the foot of the Stairs, where they stay, they sa∣lute him three times, as if they spoke to one that was deaf. I shall next let you see the Order and Placing of the Officers.</P>
<P N="1">The <HI>Aga,</HI> who is Chief of the Council, and of all the <HI>Militia;</HI> he is seat∣ed in the most honorable Place, as President, and proposeth all that is to be put to the Debate, and to be resolv'd on in full Assembly. And if the <HI>Bashaw</HI> be call'd in, he singly reports his opinion as one of the rest, but can deter∣mine of nothing by his Authority.</P>
<P N="2">The Clerk or Secretary of the <HI>Divan,</HI> who writeth all that is there con∣cluded, and keepeth a Register thereof.</P>
<P N="3">The twenty four <HI>Ajabachy's,</HI> who are Officers of the <HI>Militia,</HI> nearest ap∣proaching to the Dignity of <HI>Aga.</HI> They are seated in the same Court along a Gallery, in which each takes his place, according to the Seniority of his Re∣ception.</P>
<P N="4">The <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> who may dispute, and give their Votes, as the rest.</P>
<P N="5">The <HI>Odabachy's,</HI> and sometimes also the <HI>Mansulaga's,</HI> who are Summon'd when great Affairs of State are under deliberation.</P>
<P N="6">The <HI>Chiaus</HI> of the <HI>Divan;</HI> and these by the duty of their Charge, are present to execute the Orders and Commands of Council, which for the most part consists of about seven or eight hundred Persons. For the principal Of∣ficers of the <HI>Militia</HI> have their places in it, and all of them that are in Town use to be present; so that sometimes there will be in this <HI>Divan</HI> above fifteen hundred Persons; especially when all the Officers are there, the <HI>Mansulaga's</HI> and the <HI>Odabachy's</HI> are taken in. These later, and the <HI>Boulouchbachy's,</HI> who make the greatest number of Councellors of State, and Officers, do stand in the midst of the Court-yard, each according to his Rank. They continue there sometimes six or seven hours, in the Sun, in the Rain, and in the Wind, each with his Hands across upon one another, without being permitted to al∣ter that posture of them, save upon some necessity; nor to bring thither any Arms, not so much as a Dagger, for fear of any tumult. Those who have any business there, be they <HI>Christians, Turks,</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> may stand at the en∣trance of the Court, up and down which certain <HI>Chiaus's</HI> pass to and again with Pots full of Water, to offer those to drink that desire it.</P>
<P>All the Affairs of this <HI>Divan,</HI> are propounded and resolv'd in the <HI>Turkish Tongue;</HI> so that there is a necessity that all the Officers do understand and speak it; otherwise they cannot be admitted into the same. And this is practised amongst them, thereby to testifie how much they value and esteem the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire. And for this cause it is, that they have always in the <HI>Divan</HI> an Inter∣preter of Languages, of which they ordinarily make use to understand the <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> when they have any Complaint or Petition to present: there being no Nation in that place, which hath not his <HI>Truchment</HI> to explain his thoughts. These Officers and Councellors of State being in this man∣ner assembled, the <HI>Aga</HI> propoundeth with an audible voice that which is then to be debated, addressing himself first to the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> if he be present, and to
<PB N="230" REF="156"/>the twenty four <HI>Ajabachy's:</HI> Which being done, he puts the thing to the Vote of the whole <HI>Divan,</HI> and requires their opinion and resolution in the Case; which is taken in this manner.</P>
<P>After that the four Officers, which are call'd <HI>Bachouldala'es,</HI> have heard the Proposal of the <HI>Aga,</HI> they make it to be understood to the whole <HI>Divan</HI> in a loud voice, without stirring from their places. The word thus past unto the last of the Officers, remounts from one to another, with a strange voice and murmuration, when it happens that the thing doth not please the assembly. And that being done, the <HI>Aga</HI> giveth his Determinations according as the Vote was for or against the Proposal that he made. In the mean time, a∣mongst this confus'd variety of Opinions, they observe not for the greater part of the time either Order or Law; but are constrain'd to conclude the Affair indifferently either with Justice or Injustice, as it best pleaseth these goodly Councellors; who being for the most part Mechanicks, know not how either to write or read: so that consequently in their ridiculous Advice they are guided onely by the motion of their Passion, and of their bruitish Ignorance; wherein sometimes they fall to hot Contests. As parti∣cularly upon the Twenty sixth of <HI>August,</HI> in the Year One thousand six hun∣dred thirty four, there happened to arise a great Difference betwixt the <HI>Ba∣shaw,</HI> and the Assembly. The noise thereof was such, or to say better, the howlings were so great, that no man ever heard any thing so frightful. In this Commotion they pusht one the other, with design to rush upon the <HI>Ba∣shaw;</HI> and seem'd to argue with each other, who should be the first that should lift up his arm to strike. For it is a Custom, that he that beginneth the Tumult, in lifting up his hands which he holdeth across in the Assembly, is sure, that, whether he have right on his side or no, he shall be seiz'd on, and put into a Sack, and thrown into the Sea. Which yet did not happen at that time, for that in the end the <HI>Bashaw</HI> and the <HI>Aga</HI> found out a way to appease the Tumult.</P>
<P>Where it is farther to be noted, that the Women who have Complaints to offer, assemble sometimes to the number of an hundred of their Kinswomen and Friends, who all veil'd repair to the Gate of the <HI>Divan,</HI> and there cry, <HI>Charala,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Justice of God,</HI> and are very readily heard.</P>
<P>¶ IN the last place, we will briefly give an Account of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, when he besieg'd this City; and of the great Loss he suffer'd therein.</P>
<P>This Prince in the Year One thousand five hundred forty one,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth besieges <HI>Algier.</HI></NOTE> having Em∣barqued upon the Sea an Army of Twenty two thousand Men aboard Eigh∣teen Gallies, and an hundred tall Ships, not counting the Barques and Shallops, and other small Boats, in which he had engaged the principal of the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Nobility, with a good number of the Knights of <HI>Maltha;</HI> he was to Land on the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> at a Cape call'd <HI>Matifou.</HI> From this Place unto the City of <HI>Algier</HI> a flat Shore or Strand extends it self for about four Leagues, the which is exceeding favourable to Gallies. There he put ashore with his Army, and in a few days caused a Fortress to be built, which unto this day is call'd <HI>The Castle of the Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the City of <HI>Algier</HI> took the Alarm, having in it at that time but Eight hundred <HI>Turks,</HI> and Six thousand <HI>Moors,</HI> poor-spirited men, and un∣exercised in Martial affairs; besides it was at that time Fortifi'd onely with
<PB N="231" REF="156"/>Walls, and had no Out-works: Insomuch that by reason of its weakness; and the great Forces of the Emperour, it could not in appearance escape taking. In fine, it was Attaqued with such Order, that the Army came up to the very Gates, where the Chevalier <HI>de Sauignac,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman</HI> by Nation, made himself remarkable above all the rest, by the miracles of his Valour. For having re∣pulsed the <HI>Turks,</HI> who having made a Sally at the Gate call'd <HI>Babason,</HI> and there desiring to enter along with them, when he saw that they shut the Gate upon him, he ran his Ponyard into the same, and left it sticking deep therein. They next fell to Battering the City by the Force of Cannon; which the Assailants so weakened, that in that great extremity the Defendants lost their Courage, and resolved to surrender.</P>
<P>But as they were thus intending, there was a Witch of the Town,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Fleet and Army o∣verthrown, and wrack'd by Witchcraft.</NOTE> whom the History doth not name, which went to seek out <HI>Assam Aga,</HI> that Com∣manded within, and pray'd him to make it good yet nine Days longer, with assurance, that within that time he should infallibly see <HI>Algier</HI> delivered from that Siege, and the whole Army of the Enemy dispersed, so that <HI>Christians</HI> should be as cheap as Birds. In a word, the thing did happen in the manner as foretold; for upon the Twenty first day of <HI>October</HI> in the same Year, there fell a continual Rain upon the Land, and so furious a Storm at Sea, that one might have seen Ships hoisted into the Clouds, and in one instant again precipitated into the bottom of the Water: insomuch that that same dreadful Tempest was followed with the loss of fifteen Gallies, and above an hundred other Vessels; which was the cause why the Emperour, seeing his Army wasted by the bad Weather, pursued by a Famine, occasioned by wrack of his Ships, in which was the greatest part of his Victuals and Ammunition, he was constrain'd to raise the Siege, and set Sail for <HI>Sicily,</HI> whither he Retreated with the miserable Reliques of his Fleet.</P>
<P>In the mean time that Witch being acknowledged the Deliverer of <HI>Algier,</HI> was richly remunerated, and the Credit of her Charms authorized. So that ever since Witchcraft hath been very freely tolerated; of which the Chief of the Town, and even those who are esteem'd to be of greatest Sanctity among them, such as are the <HI>Marabou's,</HI> a Religious Order of their Sect, do for the most part make Profession of it, under a goodly Pretext of certain Revelati∣ons which they say they have had from their Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>And hereupon those of <HI>Algier,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But the <HI>Algeriant</HI> will not own it.</NOTE> to palliate the shame and the reproaches that are thrown upon them for making use of a Witch in the danger of this Siege, do say, that the loss of the Forces of <HI>Charles</HI> V. was caused by a Prayer of one of their <HI>Marabou's,</HI> named <HI>Cidy Utica,</HI> which was at that time in great Credit, not under the notion of a <HI>Magitian,</HI> but for a person of a holy life. Afterwards in remembrance of their success, they have erected unto him a small <HI>Mosque</HI> with∣out the <HI>Babason</HI> Gate, where he is buried, and in which they keep sundry Lamps burning in honour of him: nay they sometimes repair thither to make their <HI>Sala,</HI> for a testimony of greater Veneration.</P>
<P>Here one thing very well merits our observation,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> that in the Year One thousand six hundred thirty seven, in the end of <HI>November,</HI> as those of <HI>Algier</HI> took an exact survey of the Mole of their Port in the time of a great Calm, fearing the strong Preparations of the <HI>French,</HI> wherewith they had been mena∣ced by the <HI>Sieur de Manly,</HI> they to their great astonishment, perceived without, and somewhat above the Mole, a Galley at the bottom of the Water, where it lay covered with Sand from Poop to Prow, with all its Banks of Oars. Now
<PB N="232" REF="157"/>in regard none living had seen or heard speak of such a Galley, it did much astonish every one, and invited most people to go to see it. To raise it entire there was no way, but all they could do was to get up three very fair and per∣fect Canon, and by the Arms of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth upon them, it was imagined to be a part of the Wreck of his Fleet an hundred years before, as we but now mentioned.</P>
<P>About twelve Miles from <HI>Algier,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Teddelez.</NOTE> Teddelez,</HI> the most Easterly Sea-Town of this Countrey, by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call'd <HI>Addime,</HI> seven Miles from <HI>Alzier,</HI> fortifi'd with strong Walls, that inclose above a thousand Houses, together with a Castle, the Residence of the Governor.</P>
<P><HI>Sasa,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sasa.</NOTE> formerly call'd <HI>Tipassus,</HI> and by some <HI>Old Algier;</HI> because the other, as they say, was built out of its Ruines: Heretofore it contained above three thousand Houses, but now lies desolate.</P>
<P><HI>Kol der Mudejar,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kol der Mudejar.</NOTE> a Town new built by <HI>Asan Bassa,</HI> about the Year Fifteen hundred and fifty, three Miles Eastward from the River <HI>Safran</HI> to the Inland.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are either <HI>Tagarins, Morisks,</HI> or <HI>Granadins,</HI> driven out of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Andaluzia;</HI> and <HI>Targatans,</HI> expell'd <HI>Valentia.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Soil is so fruitful,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soil of the Countrey.</NOTE> that sometimes there are two or three Harvests in a year, of Wheat, Barley, and Oats; besides other Plants, which it affords the whole year in great abundance. They have in some places Me∣lons, very delicious in Taste; some of which are ripe while others are green; so that all Seasons produce successively ripe Melons: Besides Vines, whereon hang bunches of Grapes a Cubit long.</P>
<P>¶ THe Desarts feed Lions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beasts.</NOTE> Leopards, Tygers, Panthers, Porcupines, and Hedge-Hogs, whose flesh the <HI>Moors</HI> eat, though Swines Flesh be forbidden; Harts, Apes, Foxes, Camelions, and many sorts of Fowls, <HI>viz.</HI> Ostriches, Eagles, Hens, Partridges, and the like: Oxen also with straight Horns an Ell long, and Sheep with three, four, five, or six Horns, and Tails thirty, forty, or fifty pound weight, besides Horses and Camels.</P>
<P>Here are also two strange Beasts; the one call'd a <HI>Gapard,</HI> the other a <HI>Cicu∣lis:</HI> the former frequently made tame, as <HI>Gramay</HI> says, and us'd to hunt with by reason of its swiftness; it hath a Head like a Cat, but much bigger, a spot∣ted Tail like a Panther, the Feet behind longer and higher than those before; one main cause of his great speed in running. The other neither a Dog nor a Fox, but partaking of both; having one peculiar and rare property to cure Lameness with his Breath, if the same be taken in the morning upon the hand, and that apply'd to the part affected, chafing the same.</P>
<P>¶ THe Native Inhabitants of <HI>Algier,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Constitution of the Inhabitants.</NOTE> are whiter than the rest of the Countrey, strong-limbed, and well set; but there are not many; for people of all colours reside there; some for the Wars, as the <HI>Janizaries;</HI> some for Profit, as the <HI>Turks;</HI> some for Trade, as Merchants; some upon force, as the <HI>Granadines</HI> and <HI>Andaluzians,</HI> driven out of <HI>Spain;</HI> besides the Slaves of all Countreys. <HI>Jews</HI> also and <HI>Moors,</HI> that serve the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Wars, and come out of the Mountains of <HI>Kouko</HI> and <HI>Labez.</HI></P>
<P>Without the City live none but <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Alarbes;</HI> not in Houses, but seat∣ter'd up and down in Huts and Tents in the open Fields.</P>
<PB N="233" REF="157"/>
<P>The King and the Grandees of the Court, wear their Beards long; but o∣thers shave close, cutting off withal the Hair of their Heads, excepting one Lock on the Crown, by which they believe they shall be drawn up to Paradise. They Bathe often, and Wash every Morning before they do any thing; then again before their <HI>Sala,</HI> or Prayer; also before Dinner: at each Lotion the Water is pour'd into the Palms of their Hand, which they suffer, or rather cause to run up to their Elbows.</P>
<P>¶ MOst of the Houses are built Four-square, two, three, four,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> and five or six Stories high, Flat-rooft for conveniency of Walking, receiving both Air and Light from the Doors, and small Windows. In stead of Chim∣neys, great Vessels fill'd with Earth stand at the Doors, whereon with Wood and Coals they Dress their Meat.</P>
<P>The Palaces of the Kings and other Grandees, have great Quadrangles, beautifi'd with curious Columns; the Floors of the Rooms Boarded, spread over with Tapestry, into which whoever goes, leaves his Shoes standing be∣fore the Door.</P>
<P>¶ THeir Houshold-stuff is little, being for the most part one Matt,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houshold-stuff.</NOTE> a Ta∣pestry Quilt, and two Cloths spread at one side of the Room, some Earthen or Wooden Pots and Dishes, long Spoons, and Wooden Cup-boards and Chests. In stead of a Bedstead,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ledikani.</NOTE> they lay two or three Sticks from one Wall to another, two or three Foot from the Floor, over which they lay Planks, whereon they lay a Quilt; upon which they lie, covered onely with a Blanket.</P>
<P>Their usual Food is Rice, Couscou's, and boyl'd Meat, with some Fruit. They drink Water; yet some of them, notwithstanding the Prohibition of their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> drink Wine also.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Moors</HI> of this Province live some by Husbandry,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Employment.</NOTE> some by Handi∣crafts, others by Merchandising, but most by Robbing of <HI>Christian</HI> Ships. The <HI>Janizaries</HI> employ themselves in Souldiery, but the <HI>Arabians</HI> live Slovenly and Poorly, getting all they have by Cheating and Treachery. The <HI>Granadins</HI> use all manner of Trades, wherein they are very skilful and Arts-Masters. The Women do nothing but sit all day on Matts or Tapestry, en∣tertaining one another with Discourses, or else in Visits of their Friends, going to the <HI>Bannia's,</HI> Recreating themselves in the Gardens without the City, or at Feasts.</P>
<P>¶ THe Habits here are several; for <HI>Christians</HI> and free People, as <HI>English,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habits.</NOTE> French, Netherlanders,</HI> and others go Clothed according to the Fa∣shions of their several Countreys; but the Slaves wear commonly a Gray Suit, with a Coat or Cap, like a Sea-mans.</P>
<P>The Common People wear in the Winter over their Shirts, a Linen or Woollen pair of Drawers, a white Woollen Coat, with a white Cap fastened behind, call'd <HI>Galela;</HI> others have a Garment on hanging down to their Knees, which they throw over their Shoulders, and under their Arms, like a Cloak, call'd <HI>Golela,</HI> commonly Dy'd Black. In the Summer they have two large Frocks, or Coats on, which they call <HI>Adorta:</HI> upon their Head is a <HI>Turban</HI> of slight Linnen, or Cotton-Cloth.</P>
<PB N="234" REF="158"/>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Apparel of the Women differs little from that of the Men, onely they are much statelier and thinner; their Shifts come down to their Ankles, their Hair braided and ty'd up with Necklaces of Gold, Bracelets of the same, rich Pendants and Jewels in their Ears, and square Caps on their Heads. When they go abroad, they have a Vail or Mantle of fine Linnen hanging over their Heads, and clasp'd on their Breasts, so that nothing can be seen but their eyes; but in the House they wear a Silk Frock over their Linnen Shift.</P>
<P>¶ THe Antient Inhabitants of <HI>Algier</HI> us'd the <HI>Punick Tongue,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Language.</NOTE> and when subject to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, the <HI>Latine,</HI> as may be observ'd from divers Inscriptions yet to be seen. But when the <HI>Arabs</HI> over-ran the Countrey, they brought in use the <HI>Arabick,</HI> in which all publick Writings and Letters are still written more frequently than in the <HI>Turkish.</HI> The <HI>Morisk</HI> also is much us'd; but the common and vulgar Speech, as well here as in the <HI>Levant</HI> and other Eastern Countreys, as well by <HI>Mahumetans</HI> as <HI>Christians,</HI> is <HI>Lingua Franca;</HI> being a Medley compos'd out of the <HI>French, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongues.</P>
<P>¶ HEre is a Custom deviating a little from the <HI>Alcoran,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Marriage.</NOTE> the restraining Men to four Wives, whiles this gives liberty for as many as one pleases; but the <HI>Algerines</HI> are oblig'd by their Custom, and keep within the compass of four Wives; but their wanton lusts towards Concubines and <HI>Ca∣tamites</HI> are unbridl'd, and without limitation: Others assume the liberty of seven, among whom they divide the nights, and allow every one a several Chamber; but this produces heart-burnings and jealousies which many times prove fatal to either, or both.</P>
<P>The Bridegroom, as we have before related, sends Gifts to the Bride for several days before the Wedding, making merry with his Friends. The Bride receives all sitting upon the Ground, accompani'd with other Women, especi∣ally the Garments, which trim'd with Jewels, and fit for wearing, are or∣derly
<PB N="235" REF="158"/>

<P>When a Man lies upon his Death-bed, he is tended by Men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Funeral Pomp.</NOTE> as Women are by those of their own Sex: when Dead, the Corps is washed with warm Wa∣ter and Sope, then wrapt up in white Linnen, and a <HI>Turban</HI> laid upon it. Thus prepared, it is set upon the Bier, and with the <HI>Alcaid</HI>'s Licence, convey'd to the Grave in the Fields without the City Gates, Clothed, and with the Head forward, where it is Interr'd and cover'd with Earth. Some few days after, if it were a rich Person, at his Head and Feet are Stones set up, with Inscriptions and Epitaphs to the honour of the Deceased, and some select Sentences out of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> laid upon him.</P>
<P>They make no shew of Sorrow by their Clothing,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorrow.</NOTE> onely the Women wear for some days over their Faces, a black Cloth, and the Men for a Moneth never Shave themselves; both Men and Women visit the Grave for the space of three Days, bestowing on the Poor, as a Benevolence, Bread and Figs, and continu∣ally saying over the Tomb with hideous out-cries, <HI>Celam Ala,</HI> that is, <HI>Gods Light bless thee.</HI></P>
<P>In the same manner almost are the Grandees, and the Commanders in the Wars buried, but with greater Pomp and State; that is, the Corpse is laid into a Coffin adorn'd with carv'd Work, and other costly Ornaments; and so carried to the Burying-place, the <HI>Marabout</HI> going before, and his Family and Servants bearing his Launce and Scimiter after him, follow'd by Horses and Camels in great number; of which the PRINT affords a sight.</P>
<P>Most people in <HI>Algier</HI> walk on foot, few ride a Horse-back except <HI>Alkadies,</HI> Governors of Provinces, or other great Lords; others of meaner Quality u∣sing Asses. The Women seldom or never go afoot, but are carri'd upon As∣ses cover'd with a kinde of Canopy, as we have declar'd before, and sitting in a four-square Box drawn round with Curtains.</P>

<P>In such like broad Frames set upon Camels, many are carried in their Jour∣neys to <HI>Mecha,</HI> to visit <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb, partly to shrowd them from the heat of the Sun, and to keep the Sand from flying into their Eyes as they go through the Sandy Desart. Two Men may conveniently sit in these, but with their Legs across; which is not troublesom, being the fashion of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The general Coyn and Money current here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coyn.</NOTE> both amongst the <HI>Turks, Moors, Jews,</HI>

Fourteen <HI>Aspers</HI> and a half make a <HI>Spanish Ryal,</HI> and Four and twenty <HI>Doubles,</HI> that is worth about Nine Shillings <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Their Gold, which has an allay of a little Copper, is for the most part Coyned at <HI>Tremecen,</HI> being round, and of three sorts, <HI>viz.

But this Revenue is as uncertain as the Prizes they take from the <HI>Christians,</HI> of which the <HI>Bassaw</HI> receives a seventh part; as also of the Customs of import∣ed and exported Merchandise. The most certain In-come is the Pole-money of the <HI>Jews, Moors,</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> who all pay either by the Head or Family: and is Collected in this manner.</P>
<P>Every year the <HI>Algerines</HI> send into the Field three Bands or Flying-Troops of <HI>Janizaries,</HI> each containing two or three hundred;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Tribute of the Level Countrey is brought in by the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs.</HI></NOTE> one of these marches to the West of <HI>Tremicen;</HI> the second Eastward, to the Coast of <HI>Bona</HI> and <HI>Constan∣tine;</HI> and the third South, to the <HI>Negroes</HI> Countrey and Wilderness. This last hath the greatest trouble, because for the most part they continue out six or seven Moneths.</P>
<P>Every Troop is commanded by an <HI>Aga,</HI> who is as much as a Collonel; un∣der whose Command and Conduct they forceably Collect those Tributes among the <HI>Moors,</HI> wilde <HI>Arabs, Advares</HI> and <HI>Alarbs,</HI> who pay nothing but by Com∣pulsion. For this Oppression and Tyranny they are generally hated, and the people certainly knowing the time of their coming, oftentimes break up their Tents, and drive all their Cattel before them into the Mountains where the Convenience or Strength of the Place gives them hope to have an op∣portunity of avoiding their Cruelty. These Marches are contrived always to begin in Harvest; but if it happen they can get neither Money nor Coyn, they secure themselves by taking their Cattel and Corn, and sometimes their Children. All the gather'd Tributes are brought to <HI>Algier,</HI> and a particular Accompt thereof given in the <HI>Divan.</HI></P>
<P>Some perhaps at first hearing may wonder how one of these Troops, at most not above three hundred strong, can so easily run down the whole Coun∣trey; but his own recollected thoughts will easily rectifie him, when he shall consider, the one are ignorant of Martial Discipline, and that breeds in them a want of courage, neither know how to manage those few Arms they have;
<PB N="238" REF="160"/>whereas the other are compleatly arm'd, well disciplin'd, and daily exercis'd in the Wars.</P>
<P>The Register or Secretary of the <HI>Divan</HI> hath the Command or Check of those Troops, of whom he always hath a List or Muster-Roll; by which knowing every mans Quality and Service, he accordingly puts him upon Du∣ty. And when they go out to fetch Contribution, though they be all Foot-Soul∣diers, yet are they allow'd Horses as well as their Officers; onely with this difference, the Commanders have Slaves to look to their Horses, which the others may not.</P>
<P>When they draw out of <HI>Algier,</HI> they Rendezvouz about the City, lying in Tents till they meet together.</P>
<P>But when they march, they commonly have their Allowance of Bread, with a little Oyl, Vinegar, Rice, and Couscous. What other Provisions they will have, they must buy with their own Money; but that they take no great care for, as well enough knowing how to fetch Victuals abundantly from the <HI>Arabs</HI> and <HI>Moors.</HI> The greatest gain those Companiess make, ariseth from the Ostridge Feathers they bring from the Wildernesses in the South, which upon their return they sell very dear.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Corsairs</HI> or Pyrates, the best account that can be given of them, is from the great number of their Ships wherewith they put to Sea; which amount to thirty five in all: A List of which, with the Names of the pre∣sent Commanders as they were in the Year 1668. and what each Ship carries in her Stern, with the number of Guns, we have here inserted, as followeth.</P>

<P>This is the Number and Quality of their Strength at Sea, with which they do infinite Robberies; besides the vaste numbers of Christians which they reduce into a miserable Slavery. <HI>Gramay</HI> in his time reckon'd their num∣ber to above thirty thousand; but that we may well suppose to exceed: Nor is it an easie matter to make a certain Calculation. But if they were much fewer than they are, yet were it a Meritorious Work for any, or all Christi∣an Princes and States to unite to unroost that Den of Thieves, whose inhu∣mane Cruelties merit nothing but utter destruction: And although since the before-mention'd Defeat of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Emperor, no great Attempt hath been made upon them, yet lately in 1669.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles</HI> the Second, of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> a Squadron of His Majesties Ships, under the Command of Sir <HI>Thomas Allen,</HI> lay before the Place, declaring War against them, and seiz'd two Barques and a Galliot with about seventy <HI>Turks,</HI> burning another in the Haven.</P>
<P>¶ THese Advantages, and in truth all other their Wealth coming in by the Souldiers, make them to be so highly esteem'd, that it is Death to strike one of them; nor are they liable to the Censures or Punishment of any Officer but their own <HI>Aga.</HI> And notwithstanding they consist of all Na∣tions, as <HI>English, French, Spanish, Italian, Germans, Dutch,</HI> and others; yet are they so well govern'd, and live in such unanimity, that very seldom a quarrel is heard of among them.</P>
<P>As to other particular Singularities in this Kingdom, we will give a parti∣cular Account thereof in its proper place.</P>
<P>¶ THis Countrey in the time of <HI>Juba,</HI> that Sided with <HI>Pompey</HI> against <HI>Cae∣sar,</HI> was very potent, and a terror to its Neighbors. But this flou∣rishing Greatness at length decay'd; the Dominion sometimes resting in <HI>Con∣stantine,</HI> other whiles in <HI>Bona,</HI> and lastly in <HI>Tremecen,</HI> from whence wrested by the <HI>Mahumetan Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Barbary</HI> divided into several Kingdoms as at this day.</P>
<P>In the Year One thousand five hundred and ten,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferdinaud</HI> King of <HI>Spain</HI> besieges <HI>Algier.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Don Pedro</HI> of <HI>Navarre</HI> ha∣ving subjected the Cities of <HI>Oran</HI> and <HI>Bugy</HI> to his Master <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> reduced <HI>Algier</HI> to such extremity, that finding themselves not able to withstand him, they submitted to <HI>Selim Eutimi</HI> the Great Prince of the <HI>Alarbes,</HI> who had always liv'd in the Campaignes about <HI>Algier,</HI> under whose Protection they made it their whole work by perpetual Incursions to infest the Coasts of <HI>Spain, Majorca, Minorca,</HI> and the other Islands, whereupon <HI>Ferdinand</HI> sent a powerful Fleet to destroy <HI>Algier:</HI> The Citizens seeing such a Naval Force ready to fall upon them, submitted to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> obliging themselves to pay an Annual Tribute: However the <HI>Spaniard</HI> built a Castle in the City, wherein was always two hundred Souldiers, and great store of Ammunitions and Provisions, whereby he kept both Pyrates and Citizens in awe, which continued as long as <HI>Ferdinand</HI> liv'd.</P>
<P>After <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s Death, with the Consent of their Prince <HI>Selim Eutimi,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And distresses it.</NOTE> they sent to <HI>Aruch Barberossa,</HI> who was then at <HI>Hegir,</HI> a place on the side of the <HI>Mid∣land-Sea,</HI> distant from <HI>Algier,</HI> Eastward a hundred and eighty <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, in∣treating

</FIGURE> him to make all the haste he could with his <HI>Turks</HI> and Gallies to deli∣ver them out of the hands of the <HI>Christians,</HI> who much incommoded them by the Fort, promising to reward him nobly for his pains. <HI>Barbarossa</HI> immedi∣ately comes thither, and in a short time secretly murther'd <HI>Selim Eutimi</HI> in a Bath: Which done, he caused his own Souldiers to Proclaim him King, then summoning the wealthiest Citizens, he forc'd them to acknowledge him: Whereupon he Coyn'd Money, new Fortifi'd and Garrison'd the City, made himself Master of <HI>Tenez,</HI> and the Countrey round about, subjected <HI>Tremisen,</HI> by the Help and Treachery of the Natives, who joyn'd with him against their King, and became dreadful to all his Neighbors.</P>
<P>But Divine Justice at length gave a check to these Successes by his Death; for in the Year 1517. by the Marquess of <HI>Comares,</HI> who was march'd out of <HI>Oran</HI> against him in the behalf of the dispossessed King of <HI>Telensin,</HI> with ten thousand <HI>Christian</HI> Souldiers at a Passage of the River <HI>Huexda,</HI> he together with Fifteen hundred <HI>Turks</HI> were kill'd.</P>
<P>After his Death, his Brother <HI>Cheredin Barbarossa</HI> was chosen King by a gene∣ral Consent; who though a man of great Valour and Conduct, yet sent a Galley with Letters to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> desiring his Assistance and Protecti∣on against the <HI>Christians:</HI> very readily did the <HI>Turk</HI> consent to his Request, sending thither two thousand Native <HI>Turks:</HI> Thus fell this City and King∣dom to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> to whom it is yet subject, Govern'd by a <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> who is entituled a <HI>Bassa,</HI> to whom the <HI>Christians</HI> give the Stile of <HI>Highness.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THeir <HI>Marabouts</HI> carry so high a reputation among them, that what∣ever they say is look'd upon as an Oracle, and their Commands obey'd even to the hazzard of life: They cut not the Hair of their Heads or Beards; their Habit a long Coat to their Heels, over which a short Cloak reaching but to the middle of their Back, as in the foregoing PRINT doth more plainly appear.</P>
<PB N="241" REF="161"/>
<P>Their Religion and Worship is the same with other <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> or at least very little differing; each having an equal Reverence for the <HI>Alcorna,</HI> and using both the same Times and Method of Devotion.</P>

<P><HI>BUgie,</HI> formerly a Kingdom, by the <HI>Moors</HI> call'd <HI>Bigeya,</HI> or <HI>Bugeya,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Borders.</NOTE> from the chief City belonging to the Dominion lying towards the Sea, borders on the West with <HI>Algier,</HI> on the East with <HI>Gigel</HI> or <HI>Gigery;</HI> before the Bounds were alter'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> this Countrey was the most Easterly Part (according to <HI>Davity</HI>) of the <HI>Caesarian Mauritania,</HI> bordering then on the West (as we said) with <HI>Algier,</HI> on the East with the City of <HI>Tenez,</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> the Less; having the <HI>Midland-Sea</HI> and the City <HI>Collo</HI> on the North; and on the South, <HI>Biledulgerid,</HI> and <HI>Numidia.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey stretching almost Fifty <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles towards the South, over the Mountains to the Wilderness of <HI>Numidia,</HI> contained formerly, according to <HI>Marmol, Bugie</HI> their chief City, (from whence the whole Territory is so nam'd) with the Garrison and Village of <HI>Gogere, Micila, Migana, Tezteza, La∣mora, Nekauz,</HI> the Mountains of <HI>Benijubar, Auraz</HI> and <HI>Abez;</HI> but <HI>Gramay</HI> rec∣kons thus, <HI>Gigeri, Mesile,</HI> or <HI>Misile, Stefe,</HI> or <HI>Distefe, Nekaus, Kollo,</HI> and <HI>Sukayda.</HI> But now <HI>Gigeri</HI> is a peculiar of it self, and <HI>Sukayda</HI> and <HI>Rollo</HI> are incorporated to <HI>Constantine:</HI> So that at this day <HI>Bugie</HI> contains onely <HI>Micili, Distefe,</HI> and <HI>Ne∣kaus,</HI> with the Mountains of <HI>Bugie.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Bugie,</HI> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> says <HI>Marmol,</HI> call'd <HI>Bigeya,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Bugie.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Bugeya,</HI> and held by some to be the antient Metropolis <HI>Thabraka;</HI> by others ta∣ken for <HI>Igilgilis,</HI> or <HI>Vrikerh;</HI> and by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> for <HI>Salde;</HI> lieth near the <HI>Mediterrane</HI> on the side of a great Mountain, about seventeen miles East from <HI>Algier,</HI> and the like Westward from <HI>Gigery.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> they say, first Founded this City, being invested with high, strong, and antient Walls; in Fifteen hundred and twenty well Peopled, boast∣ing of Eight thousand fair Houses. It hath also a commodious large Bay, or Road, antiently call'd <HI>The Numidian Sea.</HI> The Streets are handsome, and well∣order'd, but being upon a continual ascent or descent, they are wearisom to those whose occasions call them to walk much therein. Here are several <HI>Mosques,</HI> many Colledges, and also Cloysters, publick Inns and Houses of common Reception for Strangers, built after their own manner. They have a fair and spacious Market-place, near which, on a rising Hill, stands a strong Fortress, invironed with thick and high Walls, curiously adorned within with several seeming Characteral Mouldings, upon Plaisters, and Carved in Wood, besides exquisite Paintings, according to their manner, which, as they say, cost more than the whole Fabrick.</P>
<P>Eastward of this the River <HI>Hued-el-Quibir</HI> (that is the great River) falleth in∣to the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Micile,</HI> or <HI>Mesile,</HI> lies within thirty miles of the Border of <HI>Numidia,</HI> surround∣ed with the Mountain <HI>La Abez.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Nekaus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nekaus.</NOTE> formerly call'd <HI>Vaga,</HI> one of the delightfullest Cities of <HI>Barbary,</HI> stands on a River side seventeen miles from the Sea, and twelve from <HI>Testese</HI> on the Borders of <HI>Numidia.</HI> It hath strong Walls, and boasted formerly of stately Baths, Houses of Entertainment, wherein Strangers and Foreigners were Lodged, and well accommodated; besides many Palaces and Churches. Every House, though but a Story high, had a Garden, Planted with Vines, Da∣mask Roses, Myrrhe, and Jasmine.</P>
<P><HI>Bugie</HI> lieth almost quite hemm'd in with the Mountains of <HI>Zarara,</HI> but the most remarkable they call <HI>Bene-quibar,</HI> being five miles from the City <HI>Bugie,</HI> six miles long, and three miles broad. This Ridge of Mountains, taken toge∣ther reach along the Sea-Coast thirty miles, and are in some places six or seven miles broad.</P>
<P>¶ THe Land about <HI>Bugie</HI> is barren, and unfit for Tillage; yet it brings forth excellent Garden-Fruit. Near the City <HI>Nekaus</HI> are large Plains abounding with Corn, and on the River stand an incredible number of Hazel and Fig-Trees, accounted the best of that Countrey.</P>
<P>¶ THe Mountains afford little Wheat, but abundance of Barley, besides Nuts and Figs, Flax, and Hemp, whereof much (but course) Lin∣nen is made; Iron-Mines also, and good Wood: The Inhabitants also keep a great number of Horses, Oxen, and Goats.</P>
<P>¶ THe Women of <HI>Nekaus</HI> are handsome body'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Constitutions and Customs of the Inhabitants.</NOTE> and fair, with black and shining Hair; which makes them take a pride to frequent the Baths. The Inhabitants of <HI>Micile</HI> are Clownish, and exceeding Rustical, sturdy and revengeful: so also the Mountaineers.</P>
<P>Some of them are kind in their Conversation, and very much inclin'd to Pastime, and, more than any, use Musical Instruments. Those of <HI>Nekaus</HI> have a good Mien, and comely Deportment, milde, sure Friends, and always neat in their Apparel. And though every Mountain is possest with a several Family, yet their Customs and manner of life are all one.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Bugie</HI> and <HI>Nekaus</HI> have their Colledges, where their Youth are in∣structed in the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Laws and Philosophical Studies; the Students Cloathes and Diet born at the Cities Charge. The Inhabitants of <HI>Micile</HI> are all Artificers and Husbandmen.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Mountains mark themselves, according to an Anti∣ent Custom, with a black Cross on their Cheeks, and on the Palms of their Hands; which first they us'd when they were subdu'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who then requir'd no Tribute of the <HI>Christians:</HI> Whereupon many of them took up the Badge of <HI>Christians,</HI> so escaping the Tax that was laid on other Perswasi∣ons; which though now useless, they continue as a fashion, neither knowing the Cause nor Original.</P>
<P>The Riches of the Inhabitants consisteth in their Cattel,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Riches.</NOTE> Corn, Plants, Lin∣nen, and Hempen Cloth. The Mountaineers use for their Coyn small Gads
<PB N="243" REF="162"/>of Iron, of half a pound weight; yet they Coyn also small Pieces of Silver.</P>
<P>¶ IN the Declension of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the <HI>Goths</HI> expell'd their Legions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Government.</NOTE> and made themselves Masters of <HI>Bugie,</HI> and there settled the Royal Seat of their new Government, under their Prince, King <HI>Abni;</HI> These in the Year Se∣ven hundred sixty and two, were driven out by the <HI>Saracens;</HI> and about a hundred years after that, <HI>Joseph,</HI> the first King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> gave the Kingdom and Castle of <HI>Bugie,</HI> then subdu'd by him, to one <HI>Hucha-Urmeni,</HI> though a <HI>Sa∣racen,</HI> without paying or doing Homage. And though his Successor was di∣sturb'd by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> yet afterwards they held a fair Correspondence with <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>But two hundred and sixty years since, the Sovereign Power falling, it be∣came Tributary to the King of <HI>Telensin,</HI> under which it continu'd till the Reign of <HI>Abuferiz,</HI> King of <HI>Tunis,</HI> who subdu'd <HI>Bugie,</HI> giving it to one of his Sons call'd <HI>Habdidi Haziz,</HI> with the Title of King; whose Race Govern'd by Succession, till <HI>Don Pedro de Navarre,</HI> by Command of King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred and ten, with a strong Army Conquer'd it for the <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> who slighted the old Castle, and cast up two other new Forts on the Shore by the Haven.</P>
<P>This City and Forts <HI>Barbarossa</HI> supposing to stand in his way, as opposing the Designs he had upon several parts of <HI>Barbary;</HI> and at the invitation of the expell'd King, came in the Year Fifteen hundred and twelve, with twelve Gal∣leys well man'd, and an Assistance of three thousand <HI>Moors,</HI> drawn by their King from the Mountains, and pitched before the City; yet after so fair a shew of his great Power, eight days continually battering the Castle, being discourag'd by a small Shot receiv'd in his left Arm, he faintly withdrew, and broke up the Siege, returning to <HI>Tunis,</HI> and the King to the Mountain.</P>
<P>This much troubling <HI>Barbarossa,</HI> that he had so dishonourably forsaken such an Enterprise, having recover'd his Wound, in the Year Fifteen hundred and fourteen he renew'd the former Siege; in which plying the Castle so hot, and shaking it with his great Cannon, it fell; but the Garrison'd Souldiers retir'd into the City. Then instantly he apply'd himself to the Storming of the other Castle, and without doubt would have carried it, though in the first Assault there remain'd an hundred <HI>Turks,</HI> and as many <HI>Moors</HI> dead upon the Spot, had not <HI>Martin de Reuteria,</HI> with five Ships, and a competent number of Souldiers, came opportunely to their Assistance into the Haven: where∣upon <HI>Barbarossa</HI> was once more compell'd to depart to <HI>Gigeri. Charles</HI> the Fifth Emperour, seeing of what great consequence it was to keep this place for the more easie Conquest of <HI>Algier,</HI> for the better Security thereof, built a Fort upon the Hill which commanded the Castle.</P>
<P>At length those of <HI>Algier,</HI> after many fruitless Attempts, became Masters thereof in the Year Fifteen hundred fifty and five, by the Conduct of the <HI>Bassa Sala,</HI> who with three thousand <HI>Turks,</HI> and thirty thousand <HI>Moors,</HI> be∣leaguer'd in two places both the Castles as well by Land as Water. First he gain'd the Castle lying on the Sea, cutting off most of the Defendants, then slighting it, and pursuing his Success, fell upon the other Fort with such fu∣ry, that the Lieutenant <HI>Alonso de Peralta</HI> was forc'd to desert it, and seek Refuge in the City; but considering the weakness of the Town, as not able to en∣dure an Attaque, surrendred the City, Shipping thence (according to Arti∣cles)
<PB N="244" REF="163"/>for <HI>Spain</HI> four hundred old Souldiers; for which Service he was reward∣ed, by cutting off his Head: and ever since <HI>Bugie</HI> hath been under the Go∣vernment of <HI>Algier.</HI></P>

<P>This Territory reacheth Southward to the Borders of the <HI>Numidian De∣sart,</HI> containing Mount <HI>Haran,</HI> being about twenty miles from <HI>Bugie,</HI> and fif∣teen from <HI>Constantine;</HI> and running Northward to the pleasant Valleys of <HI>Me∣sile, Stefe, Nekaus,</HI> and <HI>Constantine.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Soil is generally barren, and fit onely for Lime and Hemp, which there groweth in great abundance.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Auraz</HI> hath many Springs, which so water the Plains, that they are Plains, that they are all Morass; but dried up in the Season of the Year by the Heat of the Sun. All this high Land is inhabited by <HI>Arabs,</HI> a fierce and jealous people, not permitting any Intercourse, or the least Commerce with the <HI>Low-Landers,</HI> lest they should dispossess them of their Habitations.</P>
<P>The Village <HI>Gigeri</HI> is very rich, especially by the Trade they had in former times with the <HI>French</HI> who us'd to put in there for Hides and Wax.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> are driven out of <HI>Gigeri.</HI></NOTE> and gave himself the Title of <HI>King of Gigeri.</HI> And by that means when <HI>Cheridin, Barbarossa</HI> his Brother and Successor in his Conquest, submitted to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> this with the rest became subject to the <HI>Turks;</HI> who di∣sturb'd by the <HI>French</HI> that had won something upon it, there were still Endea∣vors by the one to keep what they had got, and by the others, to regain what they had lost: So the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>November,</HI> 1664. designing to Fortifie them∣selves, had an Assistance sent to them under the <HI>French</HI> Admiral Duke <HI>de Beau∣fort;</HI> who arriving with a Naval Army, sent a Spy to finde out the Strength of the <HI>Moors;</HI> and to prevent his Discovery, attir'd him in <HI>Turkish</HI> Habit, promising him for a Reward of his Fidelity and care, fifteen Pistols, deter∣mining upon his return to fall upon the <HI>Moors</HI> with eight hundred men; fifty of which he intended for an Ambuscade.</P>
<P>In this interim also the <HI>French</HI> Spy not being heard of, one pretending to have fled from the <HI>Moors</HI> came, and upon audience promised to bring the <HI>French,</HI> if they would Habit themselves like <HI>Turks,</HI> to surprize the Enemy: This Wheedle took effect, so that in imagination, the <HI>French</HI> were already Masters of all, and calling a Council of War, wherein consulting of affairs, it was resol∣ved, that the Places with them possessed, were Tenable by the Strength they

Hereupon Mounsieur <HI>Fretee</HI> was sent out with some Troops to try if he could by any means force the <HI>Moors</HI> from their Post; which well he might have ac∣complished, if another Officer that should have assisted him with a Party of select Foot, had not fail'd in timely Juncture: so that the <HI>Moors</HI> perceiving their small numbers, soon put them them to flight; then renewing their Bat∣teries, the great Guns quickly made the green and unsettl'd Walls of the <HI>French Cittadel</HI> to shake; which struck such a Panick Fear through the whole Camp, that they could not be staid by Blows or Commands, shewing no re∣spect to their Officers, but ran away totally in a confused Rout.

But this could not be put in execution with such speed; but that assisted by the darkness of the night, before all were gotten on Board, the <HI>Turks</HI> fell in upon the Rear, doing great execution; besides many sick and wounded Souldiers that fell into their hands, the whole Rear-Guard of four hundred men were cut off and taken; Six and thirty Pieces of Ordnance with the <HI>French</HI> Arms upon them; many Horse and a great quantity of Provisions newly receiv'd.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Borders.</NOTE> according to <HI>Marmol,</HI> that space of Land, which the Antients named <HI>Nero Numidia;</HI> containing formerly <HI>Constantine, Mele, Tefas, Urbs, Ham Samit,</HI> and <HI>Beldelhuneb,</HI> the Rivers <HI>Magier</HI> and <HI>Guadilbarbar</HI> dividing it from <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>The Head City <HI>Constantine</HI> formerly, according to <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Mela,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Head City call'd <HI>Constantine.</HI></NOTE> did bear the Name of <HI>Cirta Numidia,</HI> and <HI>Cirta Julia,</HI> having for the Founder <HI>Micipsa,</HI> King of <HI>Numidia;</HI> but <HI>Gramay</HI> thinks it a <HI>Roman</HI> Work, by the stateliness and form of the Buildings. <HI>Marmol</HI> averrs, that this City was of old call'd <HI>Kulkua,</HI> a Plan∣tation of <HI>Numidia,</HI> and that the <HI>Moors</HI> still entitle it <HI>Kucuntina.</HI></P>
<PB N="246" REF="166"/>
<P>It lieth on the South side of a very high Mountain, surrounded with steep Cliffs, from among which the River <HI>Sugefmart</HI> floweth, so that the Cliffs on both sides serve in stead of a Rampart; on the other side, strengthened with high Walls of black Stone, exquisitely hewen; through which are but two ways into the City, the one on the East, the other on the West. It contain∣eth about ten thousand Houses, many well Paved Streets, furnished with all kind of Tradesmens Shops. On the North side stands a Castle; and without the City are many old Buildings, and some Ruines, signs of its former Great∣ness: and about half a mile distant from it a Triumphal-Arch, built after the <HI>Roman</HI> fashion. From the City they go to the River by steps cut out in a Rock; within which is a Vault, whose Roof, Columns, and Floor are all of the same Piece. Not far off rises a Fountain of warm Water; a little Eastward of which, by a little Rill of fresh Water, is a Structure of Marble, garnished with Carved Images; which the Common People imagine to have been an Academy, and that the Master and Scholars for their wickedness, were meta∣morphos'd into those Statues.</P>
<P><HI>Sanutus</HI> placeth the City <HI>Chollo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kollo.</NOTE> formerly call'd <HI>Kullu,</HI> and now by some <HI>Al∣kol,</HI> by others <HI>Kol</HI> and <HI>Kollo,</HI> near <HI>Constantine;</HI> being built by the <HI>Romans</HI> at the edge of the <HI>Mediterrane-Sea,</HI> adjoyning to a high Mountain, but open and without Walls: It hath a Castle founded upon a Rock, with a convenient Road for Ships, formerly much frequented by <HI>Genouese,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Mer∣chants.</P>
<P><HI>Sukaicada,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sukaicada.</NOTE> about thirty miles from <HI>Constantine,</HI> hath also a Haven full of Tra∣ding, and a Street-way running from it a mile and a half in Length.</P>
<P>Five or six miles from <HI>Constantine,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Village <HI>Estore.</HI></NOTE> not far from the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Gigeri,</HI> lieth the Village <HI>Estore,</HI> famous for its Antiquity; and a small, but convenient Haven.</P>
<P>¶ THe Mountains are many,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mountains of <HI>Con∣stantine.</HI></NOTE> covering the whole Coast from the North to the West, and so to the East, beginning at the Mountains of <HI>Bu∣gie,</HI> and reaching alone the <HI>Mediterranean-Sea,</HI> about thirty miles; from whence arise many Fountains and Rivers, that taking their Course through the Plains, by their fertilizing Streams, greatly enrich the Places through which they pass. Here also appear scatter'd up and down many Ruines of Streets and Castles, built by the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Land about <HI>Constantine</HI> is bountiful to the Countreyman, rendring to his labour a thirty-fold return; nor are the Mountains much be∣hind, yielding good Corn, besides plenty of Olives, Figs, and other Fruits; yet nevertheless through the insolency of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> are but thinly inhabi∣ted.</P>
<P>In the beforemention'd warm Bath there is abundance of Snails with shells, which the silly Women cried out upon for Evil Spirits and Devils; attribu∣ting to them the cause not onely of all Diseases, but other evil Occurrents: As a remedy of all mishaps coming by them, they use to kill a white Hen, and thrust it with their feet into a Dish; so bringing it with a Wax-Candle to the Bath, and leaving it; which is soon conveigh'd away, and eaten, (I hope you will not think by the Snails.)</P>
<P>¶ THe Inhabitants of the City <HI>Constantine</HI> are rich, proud, and clownish, but withall couragious; those of <HI>Kollo</HI> friendly and courteous, great
<PB N="247" REF="166"/>Traders, and Lovers of Arts and Sciences. The Mountaineers are much Ci∣viler here than in <HI>Bugie,</HI> but ignorant in all parts of Literature: however they learn and use many Handicraft Trades; and without doubt would much im∣prove themselves, if they would leave off those continual Wars they manage among themselves about their Wives, which often run over from one Moun∣tain to another to get change of Men. By this means generally the Men are Souldiers, so that they can bring into the Field forty thousand Men, of the which perhaps four thousand Horse. The Citizens of <HI>Constantine, Kollo</HI> and <HI>Gigeri,</HI> yea, and the <HI>Alarbs,</HI> come to their Weekly Markets; to whom without exception they equally sell what Fruits or other Commodities they have.</P>
<P>¶ THe whole Government is Commanded by a Provincial Lieutenant,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Government.</NOTE> Residing in <HI>Constantine.</HI> Heretofore they had Kings of their own, but in the Year Fourteen hundred and twenty, becoming subject to <HI>Tunis,</HI> the Kings thereof bestowed it as a Principality on their eldest Sons; but at last in the Year Fifteen hundred and twenty, after <HI>Cheredine Barbarossa</HI> had taken <HI>Kollo,</HI> those of <HI>Constantine,</HI> weary of the <HI>Trunsian</HI> yoke, voluntarily yielded themselves up into the hands of <HI>Barbarossa;</HI> since which they have remained free from <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>

<P>¶ THe City <HI>Bona,</HI> famous for having been the Episcopal See of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Bona.</HI></NOTE> is said to be built by the <HI>Romans</HI> upon sharp and very high Cliffs on the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> having both within and without many Wells and Springs. <HI>Sanutus</HI> and <HI>John Leo</HI> say, that <HI>Bona</HI> lieth at present waste and depopulate, and another City call'd <HI>Beldelhuneb,</HI> or <HI>Beledel Ugneb,</HI> built out of its Ruines, where∣as yet <HI>Marmol,</HI> a Writer worthy of belief, averrs that the City, which the <HI>Euro∣peans</HI> call <HI>Bona,</HI> got the Name of <HI>Beledel Ugneb</HI> from the <HI>Moors;</HI> so making them both one, as indeed they are.</P>
<P>The compass thereof is small, and the Streets very narrow; so that it hath kept nothing of the former Beauty, and antient Glory, which it boasted of in the time of the Antient Father St. <HI>Augustine;</HI> having been several times de∣stroy'd by the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Saracens:</HI> particularly in Four hundred and Forty, the very year wherein St. <HI>Augustine</HI> died.</P>
<P>A small Quarter of a Mile Southwards from the City, lieth a remarkable Plain; where yet are to be seen the Marks and Monuments of the Monastery and Cloyster which that Father caus'd there to be built; which by the Foun∣dation may be judg'd to have contain'd about an hundred Paces in Length,
<PB N="248" REF="167"/>and thirty in Breadth. Near the Ruines of this Structure is a very fair and large Fountain, which the <HI>Moors</HI> of this place do to this day call <HI>Saint Augu∣stines Well.</HI></P>
<P>Eastward of <HI>Bona</HI> lieth a handsome Cittadel, built by the King of <HI>Tunis,</HI> wherein the Governor keeps his Residence; it is strongly fortifi'd, and well provided with great Cannon, and other Ammunition, as well for fetching the Revenue from the <HI>Alarbs,</HI> as to keep the Countrey in awe.

<P><HI>Mele</HI> or <HI>Mile,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mele.</NOTE> formerly <HI>Tenare,</HI> stands also near the Sea, yielding Obedience at present to the <HI>Algerines,</HI> but before subject to <HI>Constantine,</HI> from which distant three miles: The Walls are old and ruinous; the Houses sometime three thousand, now very few, and those thinly inhabited: yet the great Conduit in the very heart of the place, is no little advantage to such as dwell there.</P>
<P><HI>Tabarka,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tabarka.</NOTE> seated on the Sea-Coast, and famous onely for the Coral-fishery close by it; opposite thereto, lies an Island of the same Name, between which and the main Land, is the distance of a mile and half.</P>
<P>¶ THe Soyl of this Territory well deserves the Attribute of <HI>Bona,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soil of the Country.</NOTE> Good</HI> abounding with fresh Valleys, rich in Grain, and delightful in the shadow of <HI>Jujuben-Trees;</HI> whose Fruit the Inhabitants gather in the Summer to eat in the Winter. There grow also Figs, Apples, Pears, and very much other Fruit; but above all, yielding great store of good Cattel; as Oxen, Calves, and Sheep, call'd by the <HI>Arabians, Nedez;</HI> sufficient to give Supplies of Butter and Milk, not onely to the City <HI>Bona,</HI> but also to <HI>Tunis,</HI> and the Island <HI>Zerbes.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Mountains for the most part lie destitute of People, yet full of pleasant Springs, having Water enough to give a Current to several Rivers, which afterwards take their course through the Plains, between the Hills and the <HI>Midland Sea.</HI> The Coast hereabouts yields much Coral, both white, red, and black; being a kind of Plant, or Shrub, growing in the Water between the Rocks.</P>
<P>¶ THis City and Province were-Governed by <HI>Xeques</HI> and peculiar Lords of their own,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Government.</NOTE> till the King of <HI>Tunis,</HI> having subdued them, built a strong Castle on the East side of the City to keep it in awe; but after∣wards <HI>Aruch Barbarossa,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred and twenty, coming with two and twenty Galleys and Ships into the Haven, forced the Citizens to ac∣knowledge him: by which means they became Subjects to the Kings of <HI>Algier,</HI> and so have ever since continued, excepting for a short space, that the Empe∣ror <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, in the Year Fifteen hundred thirty five, made himself Ma∣ster of it.</P>

<HEAD>THE FORT OF FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>SIx Miles to the East of <HI>Bona,</HI> between the Kingdoms of <HI>Algier</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter Davity, Estat Ture on Affique.</NOTE> and between the <HI>Black</HI> and <HI>Rosie Cape,</HI> you may see a Fort, Commanded by the <HI>French,</HI> and call'd <HI>Bastion de France,</HI> that is, <HI>French-Fort.</HI> Formerly near this <HI>Cape of Roses</HI> stood another Building, erected in the Year Fifteen hun∣dred sixty one, by two Merchants of <HI>Marseiles,</HI> with the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s con∣sent, call'd a Fort, but indeed was onely a Flat-rooft Ware-house, for a resi∣dence of the <HI>French,</HI> who come thither, and employ the Natives Diving for Co∣ral, and under that pretence Exported all sorts of Merchandise, as Grain, Hides, Wax, and Horses, which they bought there with more liberty, and for less Price, than in the Island <HI>Tabarka,</HI> because no <HI>Turks</HI> lay there to hinder them.</P>
<P>But many years since this Structure, whose Ruines yet appear, was beaten down by the <HI>Algerines,</HI> oppressed with a great scarcity of Provisions, which the <HI>Moors</HI> reported was occasioned by the <HI>French</HI> Exporting their Corn. After∣wards in the Year Sixteen hundred twenty eight, by order of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thir∣teenth, <HI>French</HI> King, Mounsieur <HI>d'Argen,</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Narbone,</HI> and chief Engineer of <HI>France,</HI> was sent thither to re-build the razed Fort, who took with him all Materials necessary for the Work from <HI>Marseiles,</HI> and with great speed and dili∣gence erected this <HI>Bastion.</HI> But the Work was scarce begun when the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> came down Armed in great numbers, and forced the Mounsieur to a Retreat, and at present to Fortifie himself in a Half-Moon newly cast up, from whence with the first opportunity he took Shipping. At length the same King employed one <HI>Samson</HI> to re-attempt the same design, who brought it to some perfection, and was Governour of it. Since which another was formed upon the Island <HI>Tabarka,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty and three.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bastion de France</HI> hath two great Courts; the one to the North, where the Store-Houses for Corn and other Merchandise are, with many convenient Ground-Rooms for the Officers and Chief Commanders. The other being more large and spacious than the former, stands on a Sandy Beach, where the Ships usually come to trade for Corall, as we mention'd before. To this adjoyns a fair and great Vaulted Chappel, call'd <HI>St. Catharina,</HI> in which they Celebrate their Mass, and Preach, having convenient Lodgings above for the Chaplains and Priests. Before it there is a Church-yard, and a little on one side a Garden-house, set apart, and us'd onely for sick and wounded Souldiers. Between these two Courts towards the South, standeth a great Quadrangle built all of Stone, which is the Fort or Strength, with a flat Roof; wherein stand mounted two Mortar-Pieces, and three other Brass-Pieces, supply'd with a sufficient Garrison.</P>

<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Tunis</HI> then,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its present Borders.</NOTE> taken within these narrow Borders, begins at the River <HI>Guadelbarbar,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Tuska,</HI> dividing it on the West from <HI>Constantine,</HI> as on the East the River of <HI>Caps</HI> or <HI>Capes,</HI> by the Lake of <HI>Melaetses,</HI> separates it from <HI>Tripolis,</HI> and on the Southern Limit is the Modern <HI>Numidia.

<P>¶ THe Rivers which run thorow and water this Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Rivers.</NOTE> are chiefly four; <HI>Guadelbarbar, Magrida, Megerada,</HI> and <HI>Caps</HI> or <HI>Capes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Guadelbarbar,</HI>

<P><HI>Magrida,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magrida.</NOTE> formerly call'd <HI>Catadt,</HI> seems to be a Branch of the former; flow∣ing thorow <HI>Choros,</HI> and then entring the <HI>Mediterrane,</HI> near to a place call'd <HI>Marsa.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Megerada.</NOTE> or rather <HI>Maggiordekka,</HI> formerly <HI>Bagradag,</HI> on whose Shore <HI>Pliny, Gellius,</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> say, that when <HI>Attilius Zegulus</HI> was Consul for the <HI>Romans</HI> in these parts, during the <HI>Punick</HI> Wars, was found a Serpent of a hundred and twen∣ty Foot long, kill'd by <HI>Attilius</HI> and his Army with Arrows.

But <HI>Peter Dan</HI> avers, that on the South-side, where it lies sur∣rounded with Mountains, it hath very Fruitful-Valleys, but in all the other Parts very Dry and Sandy. <HI>Gramay</HI> and <HI>Sanutus</HI> report, that close by, the Ground is so Dry, that it had need be continually watered. This want of Wa∣ter, together with the frequent Incursions of the <HI>Alarbes,</HI> makes the Corn at <HI>Tunis</HI> very dear. The People in the Suburbs being necessitated to Wall in lit∣tle Spots of Ground, wherein to Sow Barley and Rye, to preserve it from their Pillage.</P>
<P>¶ ORanges, Lemmons, Dates, and such like Fruit, grow here plentifully;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plants or Vegeta∣bles.</NOTE> so also Olives for a mile round about the City, which afford Oyl, not onely for the Natives but Foreigners; and their Wood they burn in stead of other Fewel. <HI>Borbo</HI> produces Roses and other sweet-smelling Flowers. The high Mountain <HI>Zagoan,</HI> Barley and Honey. <HI>Genslet</HI> yields Apples, and <HI>St. Johns-Bread;</HI> but <HI>Benitefren</HI> and <HI>Naifuse,</HI> onely Barley, and but little of that.</P>
<P>¶ THe whole Countrey, especially the Mountainous Parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> are full of Ly∣ons, wild Bulls and Cows, Ostriches, Apes, Camelions, Neat, allow-Deer, Hares, Phesants; besides such abundance of Horses and Camels, that they bear little or no price.</P>
<P>¶ THe People of <HI>Tunis</HI> are <HI>Moors, Turks, Jews,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabitants.</NOTE> and Slaves of several Nati∣ons, taken by their Pyrates in the <HI>Mediterrane,</HI> and brought thither.</P>
<P>Here are also a sort of Men that Laze up and down the Streets bare-headed, and bare-footed, with Stones in their Hands, like Mad or Distracted Folks, whose careless Madness hath won such a reputation upon the folly of the Vulgar, that they not onely account them Saints, but allow them a settled Maintenance at the Publick Charge.</P>
<P>¶ THeir Cloathing is according to the best Fashion of their Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cloathing.</NOTE> each in his several Degree; but all wear <HI>Turbans,</HI> made and covered with Linnen or other Stuff, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner. Womens Habits, espe∣cially of the better sort, are very neat, and richly adorn'd with Jewels: when they go into the Street they cover their Faces with a great Cloth, over which they cast another, which they call <HI>Setfari:</HI> these multifarious Coverings, at a di∣stance make them appear of a much larger Size than ordinary: When they re∣main at home, they spend the greatest part of their Time and Means in ma∣king Perfumes, and other like Trifles, not minding Huswifery, or any other profitable Employments.</P>

<P>¶ THeir Bread is for the most part made of Wheat,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> though the vulgar use Barley; which in stead of kneading with Hands they beat with Battoons. The common Diet of Merchants, Artificers, and the like, is but a course Food, call'd <HI>Besis,</HI> made of Barley-meal and Water, like Pap or Pud∣ding; to which they give a <HI>Haut-goust</HI> with Oyl-Olive, and Juice of Lemmons and Oranges, which they buy in the Market appointed for the Sale thereof, and nothing else. Besides this they eat also Flesh, especially that of Lambs: but more than these another kind of Dish they have, in the eating whereof they take great pleasure, the common known Name is <HI>Lasis;</HI> of which who∣ever eats two Ounces, is so far from satisfying his Stomach therewith, that it rather augments it to a kind of <HI>Caninus appetitus,</HI> or unsatisfied voraciousness, attended with a continual Laughing, and other antick Gestures, till at length they fall into the extravagancies of a lustful Passion.</P>
<P>¶ IN this City are all manner of Handicrafts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Employment.</NOTE> but chiefly Linnen-Weavers, whose skill in their Trade was such as made their Cloth of great repute, both for strength and fineness.</P>
<P>The Mountaineers deal onely in Cattel, living in Hutts, which they draw together to the number of a hundred or two hundred, wherewith they conti∣nually range about and change Places, as their Cattel want fresh Pasture.</P>
<P>Those Hutt-Villages stand in order, with ways and passages between, all leading to a great Field in the midst where the Cattel feed. On the out-sides they stand so close, that they are like a Wall, passable onely at two Entrances, the one for the Cattel, and the other for the Men; and these in the Nights so secured with Trees, Thorns, and the like, that they neither fear Lyons, nor other wild Beasts.</P>

<P><HI>Peter Dan</HI> says,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter Dan.</NOTE> that the Revenue of this Kingdom is but accidental and un∣certain, accrewing chiefly, not from any standing In-come, but onely from the Fishery, which yields a Rent yearly of thirty thousand <HI>Ryalls of Eight,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> Poll-money; all the rest raised out of the Prizes of the Ships taken by the <HI>Corsaires</HI> of <HI>Tunis</HI> in the <HI>Mediterrane</HI> from the <HI>Christians,</HI> which yield Ten in the Hundred; as also from the Tributes and Taxes, which with Flying Parties they fetch from the Land of the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Moors.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Riches.</NOTE> because of the Dearness of all things, especially Corn, which they fetch from <HI>Urbs</HI> and <HI>Beggie.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Government.</NOTE> and long continued in the Line of <HI>Moorish</HI> Kings, which were not by Election, but an Here∣ditary Succession of the eldest Son of the deceased Kings; or for want of Sons, the next of Blood to the King, took the Dominion: But since their Expulsion by the <HI>Turks,</HI> the State is wholly altered, being at present Commanded by a <HI>Bashaw,</HI> or <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> sent thither from <HI>Constantinople;</HI> who Ruled with greater and more unlimited Authority than any other <HI>Bashaw</HI> of the <HI>Great Turk</HI> in <HI>Afri∣ca:</HI> He is assisted with the Council, or <HI>Divan</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> the <HI>Aga,</HI> some chief Officers call'd <HI>Beniloukbassen,</HI> and four Counsellors, who wear upon their Heads a Hood with a Silver Horn.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>PEter Dan</HI> says this <HI>Bashaw</HI> is changed every three year,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter Dan.</NOTE> and another sent in∣to his Place; whose present Authority is much eclipsed, in that he med∣dles with nothing but the Receipts of the Revenue: that those of <HI>Tunis</HI> elect a chief Officer of their own, with the Title of <HI>Dey,</HI> to whose care the Govern∣ment of the City is committed during his life, unless, which sometimes hap∣pens for miscarriages therein, displaced, and put to death. Other inferior Officers for the better Administration of Justice, are an upper <HI>Cadle,</HI> that is, a Marshal, or rather a Sheriff, who appoints under him many Substitutes, who hear and determine all criminal Causes, and such as relate to Life and Death, but not without apparent testimony. The occasions of these alterations and new settlements have proceeded from several grounds, whereof we will give you a short Narrative.</P>
<P>Not many years since, the <HI>Janizaries</HI> and other Souldiers in Pay, to the num∣ber of six or seven thousand, partly <HI>Turks,</HI> and partly <HI>Renegado's,</HI> intermixt with <HI>Moors,</HI> combined together to bereave the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of his Command, and leave him nothing but the Honour and the Office to pay the <HI>Janizaries:</HI> in prosecuti∣on of which Design they set up a <HI>Divan,</HI> or <HI>Council of State,</HI> like that of <HI>Algier,</HI> which undertook the Management of all matters of War. This continued till the Year fifteen hundred twenty four, when <HI>Kara Osman,</HI> a Native <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Ja∣nizary,</HI> and formerly a Shoemaker by Trade, but very subtle and ambitious, so won the hearts of the <HI>Janizaries</HI> by Artifices and Presents, that they decla∣red him their <HI>Chief,</HI> giving him the Title of <HI>Dey;</HI> so that thence-forward, neither the <HI>Divan</HI> nor <HI>Bashaw</HI> himself durst conclude any thing but with the con∣sent of the <HI>Dey</HI> and his Participants.</P>
<P>With the like absolute Authority have all Successive <HI>Deys</HI> governed, although the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> hath a Titular <HI>Bashaw</HI> there, who is onely concern'd in the Revenue, as we mention'd before.</P>
<P>Neither at present do these <HI>Deyes</HI> undertake or conclude any matter of Concernment, till first communicated to the <HI>Divan;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Divan</HI> or <HI>Council.</HI></NOTE> which is a select Coun∣cel of Officers chosen out of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> consisting of an <HI>Aga,</HI> a <HI>Chya,</HI> or Lieutenant, twelve <HI>Odabaschi's,</HI> four and twenty <HI>Bouloukbassen,</HI> two <HI>Secretaries,</HI> and six <HI>Chiauses.</HI> These determine all Matters both Civil and Military, but
<PB N="256" REF="173"/>not till they have first heard the Opinion of the <HI>Dey,</HI> whose single Vote, though contrary to all their Judgements, is conclusive and binding. Subser∣vient to these superior Ministers of State are many <HI>Cadies,</HI> who judge of lesser Causes, to the great ease both of the <HI>Dey</HI> and his Council. After the De∣cease of one <HI>Dey,</HI> another is chosen by the <HI>Divan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Janizaries</HI> here transact all Affairs as those in <HI>Algier,</HI> being distinguisht neither by Commanders or Justice: Out of whom are yearly chosen two Field-Commanders to gather in the Custom and Tributes of the <HI>Arabians;</HI> and for the increase of their Strength, some few <HI>Moors,</HI> by the name of <HI>Zovaners,</HI> are admitted into Pay.</P>
<P>¶ ANd here we shall succinctly render an Account of the several Revolutions that have happen'd in the Government of this Kingdom. After that the <HI>Arabians,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Mahumetane Saracens,</HI> had brought a great part of <HI>Afri∣ca</HI> and all <HI>Barbary,</HI> under their Command, and made <HI>Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> the Head-Seat of their Empire, they sent hither <HI>Abelchit,</HI> an <HI>African</HI> by Birth, who being a man of an ambitious and daring spirit, and having withall a Strength an∣swerable thereto, resolv'd to take upon him Sovereign Rule, and accordingly settled his Court at <HI>Cairavan,</HI> about thirty miles from <HI>Old Carthage. Kaim,</HI> then <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> having intelligence of this Revolt, sent thither a strong Army, whose timely Arrival smother'd the Enterprize in the birth, though he had promis'd himself a more happy Fortune; yet was he not discourag'd or disa∣bled,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tunis</HI> is a Kingdom.</NOTE> but that he transmitted to <HI>Hibraim,</HI> one of his Sons, the perfecting his De∣sign in part; for he soon after laid the Foundation of a new Kingdom in <HI>Tunis,</HI> there settling his Court, and making it the Metropolis of his Dominion.</P>
<P>This Kingdom <HI>Hibraim</HI> and his Successors held a long time, with much Fe∣licity and Honor, till <HI>Joseph</HI> King of <HI>Morocco</HI> made an Invasion upon it; whose Successors tracing the steps of his begun Attempt, never ceas'd till they got all: for <HI>Habdul Mumen</HI> having gain'd <HI>Mahadia</HI> from the <HI>Christians,</HI> in process of time wore out the Race of <HI>Abelchit,</HI> and got the total Possession thereof, go∣verning it by Vice-Roys or Lieutenants,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">It cometh under the Kings of <HI>Morocco.</HI></NOTE> without any notable molestation, during his own Reign, and his Son <HI>Joseph's,</HI> and his Successors <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Mansor.</HI></P>
<P>But after the Death of <HI>Mahumeth Ennasir,</HI> Son of <HI>Mansor,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Joseph,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mutiny of the <HI>Ara∣bians.</HI></NOTE> who was overthrown in Battel by the King of <HI>Telensin,</HI> the <HI>Abelchittin Arabians</HI> took advantage to resettle themselves in the Command of <HI>Tunis,</HI> laying a close Siege, and often storming it; so that the Lieutenant sent to the King of <HI>Morocco</HI> for Assistance; protesting, that without timely help the City must of necessity fall into their hands. Hereupon the King sent a Fleet of twenty Ships for their Relief, under the Command of his approv'd Gene∣ral <HI>Abdulhedi,</HI> a Native of <HI>Sevil;</HI> which so politickly plaid his Game, that in∣stead of fighting his Mutineers, he overcame them by Gifts and Rewards be∣stow'd among them by his Masters consent;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are stilled.</NOTE> for which great and good piece of Service, the King made him Vice-Roy, and after his Death continu'd the same Honor to his Son <HI>Abu Zacharias,</HI> a man of no less prudence and Conduct than his Father; whose Son <HI>Abraham</HI> or <HI>Abu Ferez</HI> took it upon him as by Right of Succession; and being very ambitious and proud, would not acknow∣ledge the King of <HI>Morocco</HI> for his Supream Lord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Abu Ferez</HI> sets himself up to be King of <HI>Tunis.</HI></NOTE> but made himself an abso∣lute and independent Prince; and soon after, having conquer'd <HI>Telensin,</HI> and put the Inhabitants to pay Tribute, he call'd himself <HI>King and Lord of Tunis;</HI> or as others will have it, of all <HI>Africa:</HI> Which came to pass in the Year 1210.</P>

<P>After him followed his Son <HI>Nutman,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nutman</HI> his Son cometh in his place.</NOTE> who was more unhappy than his Fa∣ther, receiving many great damages and affronts from the King of <HI>Fez.</HI> But <HI>Hakmen</HI> his Son, call'd by <HI>Gramay, Autmen,</HI> and by others <HI>Hutmen,</HI> restor'd again tose decays, leaving for his Successor the unfortunate <HI>Abu Bark;</HI> for he was scarce warm in his Royal Seat, ere he was treacherously murder'd by one of his near Kinsmen, named <HI>Yahaia,</HI> who boasted himself the Son of <HI>Omar,</HI> third <HI>Kaliff</HI> of the <HI>Saracens</HI> in <HI>Asia.</HI> But <HI>Gramay</HI> contradicts this Story, averring that <HI>Aben Ferez,</HI> before his death, divided his State between his three Sons, giving to one, <HI>Bugie;</HI> to <HI>Hamar, Numidia;</HI> and to this <HI>Hutmen,</HI> which he call'd <HI>Autmen,</HI> or <HI>Hakmen, Tunis;</HI> who barbarously put out his brother <HI>Hamar</HI>'s Eyes, and depri∣ved him of his Dominion, which he annexed to his own: however he held the Scepter forty years; which he left, as we said before,

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Muley Assez</HI> declared King.</NOTE> (as having by Treachery endeavour'd to depose his Father) and declared his Brother <HI>Muley Assez</HI> to be his Heir and Successor, to the great satisfaction of most of his Subjects, who greatly affected <HI>Muley Assez</HI> for his Endowments; and shortly after <HI>Muley Mahomet</HI> died much lamented. By this means <HI>Muley Assez</HI> became sole Master of this State; to secure himself wherein, and taking into consideration the former pretences of his imprison'd Brother <HI>Manon,</HI> he caused him privately to be put to death.</P>

<P>The News of <HI>Araxars</HI> withdrawing so inrag'd <HI>Muley Assez,</HI> that he appre∣hended

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A subtle Invention of <HI>Barbaroussa</HI> to play the Knave with <HI>Araxar.</HI></NOTE> requested Assistance from the famous Pyrate <HI>Cheredin Barbarossa,</HI> who at that time govern'd <HI>Algier</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> which was promis'd, but yet with this Caution, that it would be necessary (the more happily to bring his Enterprize to pass) to make a Jour∣ney to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> wherein he (the said <HI>Barbarossa</HI>) would accompany him, with assurance to procure from <HI>Sultan Soliman</HI> great Favour and Assistance. <HI>Araxar</HI> deluded by these Flatteries, went to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and was there very friendly receiv'd in outward appearance; but <HI>Barbarossa</HI> now minding nothing less than what he had said and written, underhand told <HI>Soliman,</HI> that in regard Prince <HI>Araxar</HI> was young, he had now a fit opportunity to annex the Crown of <HI>Tunis</HI> to his Empire.

<P>Upon the Approach of <HI>Barbarossa, Muley Assez,</HI> who knew himself too weak to stand a Siege against such a Force; and believing <HI>Araxar</HI> to be in the Fleet, added more Cruelty to his former; so that hated by his Subjects, he left the City, and betook himself to his Uncle <HI>Dorat,</HI> a man of great Power among the <HI>Arabians</HI> of <HI>Uled Aixa.</HI></P>
<P>The Citizens thus forsaken by their Prince,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turk</HI> becometh Ma∣ster of <HI>Tunis.</HI></NOTE> submitted to <HI>Barbarossa,</HI> who forthwith proclaim'd <HI>Sultan Soliman</HI> their Prince. <HI>Muley Assez</HI> on the other side (to turn the Scales) sent to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth then in <HI>Spain,</HI> and re∣quir'd his Aid; which the Emperor willingly hearkned to; and the rather, because it was confidently rumor'd, that <HI>Barbarossa</HI> intended to harrase with a strong Fleet, not onely the Coast of <HI>Italy,</HI> as he had done the foregoing year, but also against the next Summer would Ship over to <HI>Sicily</HI> an Army of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> to invade the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> Fired with this News, and also instigated by <HI>Muley Assez,</HI> he put to Sea with a strong Fleet Mann'd with <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred thirty seven, on the Five and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> being St. <HI>James</HI>'s Day; with which coming under <HI>Tunis,</HI> he took at the first Assault the Castle and strong Fort <HI>Goletta,</HI> and not long after the City it self, and with it the whole Kingdom: <HI>Barbarossa</HI> foreseeing this Storm, had withdrawn himself, and committed the Defence of the City to <HI>Mustapha,</HI> a courageous Souldier, who yielded himself up into the hands of the Emperor.</P>

And this Agreement was sworn to by both Princes with great Solemnity.</P>
<P>This Expedition thus happily performed, the Emperor upon his return, to keep up in memory so great an Action, and to encourage the Valour of such as followed him therein, instituted the Order of Knights of the Cross of <HI>Burgundie.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE DOMINION and FORT OF GOLETTA.</HEAD>
<P>THe Dominion of <HI>Goletta,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dominion of <HI>Go∣letta.</HI></NOTE> so call'd from the Fort lying on the Mouth of the Lake <HI>Goletta</HI> by <HI>Tunis,</HI> containeth these Cities, <HI>Marsa, Napolis</HI> in <HI>Bar∣bary, Kammart, Arriane</HI> and <HI>Carthago.</HI> It is look'd upon as a Place of weighty Concernment, being the Key of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and Neighbour to <HI>Carthage:</HI> Some hold it to be the Island <HI>Galatha,</HI> or <HI>Galitha</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> and the <HI>Gorilon</HI> of <HI>Pliny:</HI> but <HI>Sanutus</HI> and others make <HI>Goletta</HI> and <HI>Galatha</HI> to be two distinct Places. The Name of <HI>Goletta</HI> cometh originally from the <HI>Italian</HI> word <HI>Gola,</HI> signifying a <HI>Throat,</HI> or according to <HI>Olivarius</HI> upon <HI>Mela,</HI> from the Diminutive <HI>Goletta,</HI> that is, a <HI>Little Throat,</HI> or as we term it, a <HI>Gullet,</HI> because this Fort is built upon the Neck or Throat of a Lake of that Name, over which they pass in small Barques to <HI>Tunis;</HI> so that in truth it is an Island.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahumetans</HI> first built upon this Spot, thereby giving a beginning to this Fort; which the <HI>Turks</HI> afterwards having strengthened, the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth after,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overcome by <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperor.</NOTE> together with <HI>Tunis,</HI> took from them: but at length regain'd by the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred seventy four, as before hath been more particularly related: Since which time the <HI>Turks</HI> have, besides the old one, cast up two other Forts, with two or three Redoubts between them, and are as the Keys of their State in that Countrey. <HI>Gramay</HI> says, it contains a fair Haven, fit for many Ships to harbour in, with Store-houses for Merchandise, a Custom-house, two Mesquites, and Prisons for <HI>Christian</HI> Slaves; so that it seems much rather a City than a Fort.</P>
<P>The first Fort appears surrounded with a double Wall, flanked with Sconces, and three great Works one within another, encircling all to Com∣mand the Haven and City: In the midst is a Well of fresh Water, feeding a Stream which runs through the Fort. Little remains of the old Fort, saving a Corner of a Bulwark, Planted with ten Pieces of Ordnance, where those of <HI>Tunis</HI> maintain forty <HI>Janizaries.</HI></P>

<P>But to return to <HI>Carthage: Ibnuraquique</HI> an <HI>African</HI> Historiographer will have an <HI>Egyptian</HI> King to have laid the first Foundations 226 years before <HI>Rome:</HI> but others later. Where-ever it was first erected, sure we are, the <HI>Romans</HI> destroy'd it in the six hundredth year after the building of <HI>Rome,</HI> after it had stood above seven hundred years. This so famous City stood in the bottom of a safe and capacious Bay, strongly fortifi'd on all sides both by Art and Nature, sur∣rounded by the Sea, except where joyned to the Land by a narrow <HI>Isthmus,</HI> for∣ty five miles in compass by the outward Wall; within which were three Walls more, and between each of them were several streets with Arched Vaults un∣derneath, thirty Foot deep, wherein they could keep three hundred Elephants,
<PB N="264" REF="177"/>with convenient Fodder for them, besides Stabling for four thousand Horse, with Conveniencies of Stowage for their Provender, and sufficient Quarters in those Out-Streets for their Riders, and twenty thousand Foot besides, which never came into the City to trouble it. On the South-side stood the Castle of <HI>Byrsa,</HI> two miles and a half in Circuit; first built by <HI>Dido,</HI> as we said, and in that the sumptuous Temples of <HI>Juno, Apollo, Esculapius,</HI> and <HI>Belus:</HI> On the West a Mole, whose entrance was but seventy Foot, but within a stately <HI>Arsenall</HI> and Room for their Ships and Galleys to ride in safety. Thus commodiously seated, it conquer'd all the Sea-Coasts from the greater <HI>Sirtes</HI> to the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and so to the River <HI>Iberus;</HI> wherein was contained three hundred Cities. Not contented here, they cast an eye upon <HI>Sicily,</HI> whose defence the <HI>Romans</HI> (emulous of the <HI>Punick</HI> Greatness) undertook; which was the first <HI>Car∣thaginian</HI> War, and ended to their disadvantage, being forc'd to pay three thou∣sand two hundred Talents, amounting to two Millions of Crowns.</P>
<P>The second, begun by <HI>Hannibal</HI> the son of <HI>Amilcar,</HI> descended from <HI>Barka</HI> the Brother of <HI>Dido,</HI> who after many Victories in <HI>Spain,</HI> and much experience gained, conducted his Victorious Army through <HI>Gaul,</HI> and over the <HI>Alps</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> defeated their Armies; and slew their Consuls, but not pursuing his Vi∣ctory, after the Battel of <HI>Cannae,</HI> and eighteen years Warring in the bowels of <HI>Italy,</HI> was at last call'd home to defend <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>Scipio,</HI> who had transferred the War thither: The event was, that the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> worsted in the Battel at <HI>Nadagara,</HI> were compell'd to submit to the will of the Conqueror. The se∣cond <HI>Punick</HI> War thus ended, it might have been supposed the <HI>Romans</HI> needed not to have been any farther jealous of <HI>Carthage;</HI> which, though subject to them, because in few years very thriving, they had a spight to, as thinking them∣selves unsafe while that City stood. Resolved therefore on the destruction of it, they sent against it <HI>L. Martius,</HI> and <HI>M. Manlius</HI> their two Consuls, with a power∣ful Army, to whom the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> willingly delivered up their Arms and Shipping, contracting onely for the preservation of it self, which was promi∣sed: But when upon the delivery of their Pledges they were told, <HI>A City con∣sisted not in the Walls and Houses, but in the Laws and Government, and that these, with the Corporation should remain, but the Town be removed ten miles farther from the Sea:</HI> Enraged hereat, they resolved to abide the uttermost, but their for∣mer condescensions had made them uncapable of resistance: Therefore in stead of Iron, which they wanted, they made Arms of Gold and Silver, pull'd down the Houses to furnish Timber for a Navy, and the Ladies cut off their Hair to provide Ropes and Cordage; twenty five thousand Listed them∣selves to defend the Walls, which with great courage and constancy was a long time performed.

<P>The <HI>Syrtes</HI> are two, a greater and a lesser: the lesser is an ill Neighbour to the Gulf of <HI>Kaps,</HI> near <HI>Tripoli,</HI> being very dangerous, by reason of the Shelves, Banks, and Quick-sands lying round about: But the great <HI>Syrtes,</HI> in the Maps are call'd <HI>The Shoals of Barbary;</HI> and in <HI>Spanish, Baxos de Carthage;</HI> which is the same over against <HI>Ezzab.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Syrtes</HI> is properly a <HI>Greek</HI> word,

<P>The greater of these <HI>Syrtes</HI> is in Nine and twenty Degrees North Latitude, and Forty eight Degrees of Longitude; but the smaller in Two and thirty Degrees Latitude, and in Three and forty Degrees Longitude.</P>
<P>The Lake <HI>Tritonis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake <HI>Tritinis.</HI></NOTE> famous in Antiquity, and often mention'd by Historians, and Geographers, lies in the very heart of <HI>Little Africa.

<P>¶ THe Countrey is all Sandy,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soyl.</NOTE> and so Barren, that no kind of Corn by the best Husbandman be produced there; so that the Inhabi∣tants would almost perish with Hunger, if Corn were not Transported thither from other places to supply their defective Harvests.</P>
<P>¶ THere is in this City no fresh Water,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Scarcity of Water.</NOTE> but that which runs from the tops of the Houses through Gutters. Not far from <HI>Elhamma</HI> rises a great Spring to the Southward, whose Waters being exceeding hot, are con∣veyed by Pipes into the Bathes there; which notwithstanding its so distant Current, yet retains the Heat so powerfully, that few will adventure to go
<PB N="275" REF="184"/>into it; yet sometimes for pure necessity the Inhabitants are compell'd to drink thereof, though in regard of its Sulphurous Quality, it operates little towards the quenching of their thirst. Lastly, not far from the City is a Standing-Water, call'd <HI>The Lake of the Melatson,</HI> by reason of having a strange power to Cure the Leprosie.</P>
<P><HI>Sanutus</HI> places here the <HI>Lotus-Tree;</HI> which by some are call'd <HI>Mikakoliers,</HI> or ra∣ther <HI>Alsiers:</HI> of which Fruit, being sweeter than <HI>Dates,</HI> the Inhabitants make very pleasant Wine.</P>
<P>Lemmons, Oranges, and Dates grow here in great abundance, but no other Fruits, except <HI>Halbhazis,</HI> which groweth under Ground to the bigness of a Bean; it tastes like an Almond; but is never chew'd, onely sucked.</P>
<P>¶ THe Inhabitants of <HI>Tripolis</HI> live chiefly upon Weaving and Merchandi∣sing. Those of <HI>Kapes,</HI> being poor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Employment.</NOTE> are generally Husbandmen and Fishers, paying Tribute of all their Labors to the <HI>Bashaw.</HI> Those of <HI>Elhamma</HI> are lazy, poor, and very Thieves. The <HI>Zoarers</HI> burn Lime, which they carry to <HI>Tripolis:</HI> But all live hardly, their Food being so scarce, that he is accounted a rich Man that can lay up two Tunns of Corn for his own use.</P>

<P>The chiefest Trade now is in Blacks or Negro's, which formerly were sold in <HI>Sicilia,</HI> but now in <HI>Turky.</HI> But when we have said all, we must con∣clude, that their Pyracies at Sea brings in their greatest Gain: for though it be the most inconsiderable of all the <HI>Corsaire</HI> Towns, yet they do much mischief: which the fitness of their Scituation doth exceedingly promote, though it is a place that usually all <HI>Christian</HI> Ships, Laden with Merchan∣dise to <HI>Alexandria, Siorte,</HI> or <HI>Seide, Aleppo,</HI> and other Ports that way, must pass by.</P>

<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> that possess <HI>Barka</HI> are ill-favour'd, and crooked of Body and Conditions, driven by want continually to Rob; so that no <HI>Carravan</HI> dare pass along the Sea-Coast opposite to the Desart, but take their way sixty miles about to the In-land.</P>

<P>¶ <HI>BIledulgerid,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigness.</NOTE> or <HI>Numidia,</HI> reckons in length six hundred miles, in breadth where at widest, three and fifty.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Darha</NOTE> descending from <HI>Mount Atlas,</HI> on that side which Borders the Coun∣trey of <HI>Haskora,</HI> thence running Southwards through a Land of the same Name, loseth it self in many Rivulets, first making luxurious Vales amidst the De∣sarts.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Ziz,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ziz.</NOTE> falls branching it self also from <HI>Atlas,</HI> then recollected into one Stream, glides Southward, straitned with several Mountains, washing the Feet of <HI>Mount Gersolim.</HI> Afterward visiting the Countreys of <HI>Chenegh, Matgara, Reteb,</HI> and <HI>Segel-Messe;</HI> thence losing it self in a Desart, appears again at Fort <HI>Sugaihila.</HI> From thence carried on, making no stop till in the middle of a bar∣ren Sand choak'd up, it becomes a Lake, by none frequented but a few Hunt∣ing <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>

<P>The River <HI>Tarkala,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tarkala.</NOTE> which taketh its Name from the Countrey thorow which it glides, is but small, and its Fountain not far distant; though some suppose it springs from the Northern Hill; so hasting till stagnated, it becomes a Standing-Pool, which often swelling, turns into <HI>Morass</HI> the adjacent Valleys.</P>
<P>But <HI>Togdaa</HI> falls more probably from the Northern Mountains,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Togdaa.</NOTE> and though little at first, yet waters the Countrey of its own Name, and running South∣ward, from small grows great and sluggish; so ending its progress, there settles in a Standing-Water.</P>

<P>That part of <HI>Biledulgerid</HI> that borders <HI>Lybia,</HI> yields but a small Product, be∣ing craggy and barren Mountains, whose Skirts are of as little value, bearing nothing but inconsiderable Shrubs, Brambles, and Thorns; a dry Sterility ruling over all for want of Water.</P>
<P>¶ ALl <HI>Numidia</HI> is infected with various and deadly biting Serpents a∣broad,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beasts.</NOTE> and within with Scorpions as dangerous, which especially rage in Summer, killing many: They have store of Ostriches, Camels, and Goats, and some breeds of Horses. Their Corn-Harvest falls in <HI>April,</HI> their Dates they gather in <HI>September,</HI> and the middle of <HI>October;</HI> but if Rain happens in <HI>April</HI> or <HI>September,</HI> they neither sowe nor reap, but their stor'd up Dates, which are alwayes abundant, supplies the Effects of a bad Year; by which means, though the Seasons prove intemperate, they know no Famine: yet though the Date grows there so plentifully, that they never lack, yet they would rather have a good Fruit-year than a Corn-year, because the <HI>Ara∣bian</HI> Merchants and others bring them in store of Grain, which they willing∣ly barter for Dates. There groweth much of the Wood call'd <HI>Anil,</HI> so useful for Dying.</P>
<P>Besides ravening wilde Beasts and venomous Serpents, they suffer also much by the molestation of an East-Wind, which raising such Tempests of Sand, and beating on their Faces, gets into the Eyes of those that travel, making them always blear'd and sore; otherwise the Air of it self is very healthy,
<PB N="286" REF="190"/>and oftentimes for an hundred years together they know no Pestilence, Small Pox, nor any other such like Distempers.</P>
<P>¶ THe Inhabitants of <HI>Numidia</HI> are generally long liv'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Constitution of the Inhabitants.</NOTE> onely Scorbu∣tick, in so high a manner, that their Teeth often drop out; suppo∣sed to proceed from their constant eating of Dates; whose sweetness so in∣crassates the Blood, making slower the Circulation, that this their Diet seems to be the chief cause of that Distemper: They are also weak-sighted, and much troubled with sore Eyes, which accidentally happens from the Sandy Commotions carried on by the foremention'd noxious Eastern Winds. They are by Nature jealous, libidinous, and ignorant, not courting neither Knowledge or Learning, nor minding how to live in a plentiful manner; but though they are sedentary and slothful, yet they are deceitful, treacherous, and murdering Robbers. But some few of this Region are not guilty of this their sordid Condition, but are more generous, ingenious, very civil, and truly valiant.</P>
<P>¶ THey eat much Camels Flesh,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> and the Ostrich they esteem as a Dain∣ty; their Drink is Camels Milk, and the Liquor in which the Flesh is boil'd; not once so much as tasting clear Water.</P>
<P>Amongst their other Qualities, there are some that are so nastily sordid, that not onely they never wash their Feet, but look upon it as an abominati∣on to have clean Hands, or any part of their Bodies.</P>
<P>¶ THey <HI>Arabs</HI> that dwell in <HI>Biledulgerid,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Numidian Arabs.</HI></NOTE> are for the most part deform'd, and lean, their Complexion a deep Sallow, and not much troubled with Hair on their Chins; they are subtle and cruel. They are also long-liv'd and healthy,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frication (and not Sweat∣ing) all the Physick these <HI>Arabs</HI> use.</NOTE> which some ascribe to their Frications, and avoiding what ever cau∣ses Sweat; which is the onely Physical Application they use. All their Re∣creations are pursuing the Ostrich, and several sorts of Hawking, which they much delight in.</P>
<P>The Grandees pride themselves in their attendance of <HI>Negroes;</HI> but the Common People having no Servants, domineer over their Wives, exercising Supream Authority, putting them not onely to Womens, but Mens Drudge∣ries; as dressing and sadling their Horses, and whatsoever business else, ei∣ther in House or Field.</P>
<P>There are some of these <HI>Arabs</HI> that are Students at <HI>Fez,</HI> and such Proficients, that they Commence Doctors, and Professors of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Laws and Re∣ligion; others follow Traffick. But in most parts of <HI>Numidia,</HI> many of them are addicted to Poetry; attaining to such a heighth, that they set forth in He∣roick Verse long Epick Poems, like <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> at large, with high Fancy celebrating the valiant Acts of their former Princes and Conquerors; and al∣so they are good at Pastorals, and such business of the Field: But in Songs, Sonnets, Madrigals, and the like, which express the various Passions of sad Amours and always dying Lovers, they are most exquisite in beyond belief.</P>
<P>¶ THese <HI>Arabs</HI> are of a mild and sweet disposition,

<P>¶ THeir Habitations are Hutts and Tents,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> sometimes two hundred to∣gether; which being like a Village pitched in a round order, defends their Cattel like a Wall, which are always placed in the middle: They have onely two passages, which they stop up with Thorns, so to keep out Lyons, and other Beasts of Prey. They live together in Tribes, and remove to better Pasturage, like the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and they reckon their Riches in their Stock of Dates, and Store of Camels.</P>
<P>Yet these Countreys are Inhabited partly by other <HI>Africans</HI> and their own <HI>Numidians,</HI> and by <HI>Arabians,</HI> which drove out the antient Inhabitants, and settled themselves in the Desarts bordering <HI>Date-land:</HI> and on the other part the <HI>Nu∣midians</HI> made themselves Masters of the Wilds, that belonged to the <HI>Blacks</HI> or <HI>Negro's.</HI></P>
<P>These People are distinguished into three sorts; the first live without either Law, Religion, or Order; the second are Non-conformists to all Orders but keeping of their Herds and Cattel, which they drive from place to place, every one having their own Beasts distinguished as their proper Goods. Having no more Law then onely <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> so they mark their Cattel that they never wrangle; the third observe both Law and Religion, and are Tributary to the Kings of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> whose Dominion extends to the Countrey of <HI>Dara, Tafaletta,</HI> and <HI>Ytata.</HI></P>

<P>The Merchants adventure more by Land than ours at Sea, putting them∣selves oft in greater dangers, especially if they set forth in Summer; for then usually arise in those Countreys Southern Winds, which raise abundance of Sand, that new congealed drifts cover those Pits so deep, that all Marks are lost whereby they may recover them again, scarce guessing where they were, they often fainting with thirst perish there, as may appear by many of their dead Bodies found in the Way by following Travellers. To prevent which misery in this necessitous exigent, no other means being left, they kill their
<PB N="307" REF="201"/>Camels, and squeeze the Water out of their Bowels and Maws; which when they set forth, they Tun up in their Bellies in such a quantity as would suffice them ten or twelve days: this they refresh themselves withall, and oft save their lives till they find some formerly known Pit: yet in many places Camels Milk may be had.</P>

But if those that observe their times to Travel set forth upon the advantage of the expected Season, if then it hap∣pens, as sometimes it falls out, a general, or second Drought, then not onely Travellers are put to run the risque, but the Inhabitants lose the Product of the whole year.</P>

They are so far from Honesty or Honor, that they will Hoot at, and scorn to keep Company with such pitiful Fellows, that will scruple in the least at Cheating, Robbing, nay Murdering, if need be, and for a small Gratuity, nay sometimes <HI>gratis,</HI> any of their Kindred, Brother or Father: such is their sordid baseness, that they care not on the other side, who∣ever vitiates, or prostitutes their Sisters, Daughters, Mothers, or their own Wives: the word <HI>Cuckold,</HI> or <HI>Wittal,</HI> signifying nothing. All their study, whole endeavour, and business, besides a little Hunting, is onely mischief, either to Rob or Cheat their Companions, and driving their Cattel into the Wilderness where they may never be found: which done, they makeit their May-game to laugh and jeer at one another. Thus they spend the whole course of their lives, not staying above three days in a place.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle of <HI>Arguin.</HI></NOTE> whose Fort lies on a commanding Point, strong, built all of Stone, four hundred and five and twenty Foot in circuit, defended on the Land-side with a Wall, or Out-work, of eleven Foot thick, and four and twenty high: It hath also three Batetries, two towards the Land, and one to the Sea. This Fort hath more than ordinary accommodation, sixteen handsom Rooms of State and Address, with their Apartments, a large Kitchin, good Cellars, and other Offices, and close by accommodated with a Fountain of fresh Water.

<P>The Main Land Coasting this Bay, is dry and barren; but about five miles there are some Shrub and Heathy Grounds, from whence those of <HI>Arguin</HI> fetch their Fewel.

<P>Here are to be seen two Stone Monuments with Inscriptions upon them,

<P>The Desart of <HI>Zenega,</HI> inhabited by the People <HI>Zanaga's,</HI> is wondrous hot, and hath little or no Water but what is bitter and brackish; and those Pits or Wells are at least twenty miles one from another; But the Wild of <HI>Zenega</HI> is destitute of all Water, seldom or never raining there, having but one Pit in all the way of thirty miles.</P>
<P>This Soyl is all Sandy, and utterly unfruitful, being a vast Plain, so flat and level, that the Traveller hath no mark to find his way, or know where he is, but is forced to steer his Coast by the Sun and <HI>Trade</HI>-Winds, which blow al∣ways Easterly, and other little knowledges they gather by former Prints from the Claws of Fowl, as Crows, Ravens, and such like, which always wait up∣on the <HI>Caravans,</HI> as on great Armies, expecting Prey: for none ever travel through this Desart but with great Company.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original. <HI>Leo p.</HI> 1.</NOTE> that the <HI>Niger</HI> taketh its Original out of a Lake Eastward of the Desart <HI>Seu,</HI> gliding from thence to the West, and in the <HI>At∣lantick</HI> disburthens its self. But the <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Geographers assert, that <HI>Niger</HI> is a Branch of the <HI>Nyle,</HI> which running under ground, after a great distance shews his so long-lost Streams again. And that the <HI>Niger</HI> proceeds from the same Head or Fountain, they also affirm from these Evidences: First, that they both breed one and the same sorts of Fish, especially the <HI>Hipopota∣mus,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Horse,</HI> and overflow the Ground, inriching the Neighboring Coun∣treys near the same time and in the same manner as the <HI>Nyle.</HI> The Antients themselves, among whom <HI>Pliny,</HI> make <HI>Nylus</HI> and <HI>Niger</HI> to be of one Nature or Quality; and adde moreover, that it produceth Reeds, and the <HI>Papyrian</HI> or <HI>Paper-Plant,</HI> as <HI>Nylus</HI> doth, which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> used to write on, as we on our Paper.</P>
<P>The Modern Geographers make <HI>Niger</HI> to take its Original out of a Lake call'd <HI>The Black Lake,</HI> bordering on the Kingdoms of <HI>Medra</HI> and <HI>Vanque;</HI> and
<PB N="317" REF="208"/>make it also serve for a Boundary between the <HI>Abyssine,</HI> or <HI>Prester-Johns</HI> Coun∣trey, and <HI>Negro-Land:</HI> Afterwards it cuts through the Countreys of <HI>Biafar</HI> and <HI>Nubia,</HI> diving about eighteen miles under ground, and at last appears again, and makes the great Lake of <HI>Borna,</HI> lying upon the Borders of four King∣doms. From thence it floweth through these Realms, <HI>Guangara, Biafara, Kassena, Zegzeg,</HI> and <HI>Kano,</HI> and makes another great Lake, call'd <HI>Sigisma,</HI> or <HI>Guarda,</HI> which in the South moisteneth the Kingdoms of <HI>Mandinga, Guber,</HI> and <HI>Gago;</HI> and in the North, that of <HI>Kano</HI> and <HI>Agadez:</HI> gliding out of this Lake, it runs to the West, then rushing towards the North close by the Kingdom of <HI>Tombut,</HI> and in the South hard by <HI>Melli,</HI> spreads it self into a third ample Lake,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Niger</HI> parts into four Branches.</NOTE> from thence branching into four Rivers, near which losing its own Name <HI>Niger,</HI> receives four new Denominations: The first of which is call'd <HI>The Ri∣ver of Saint-John,</HI> which in the Bay of <HI>Arguin</HI> falls in the Ocean, whose Mouth makes the Haven <HI>Tofia.</HI> The second running direct West, which we have so often mention'd, is <HI>Zenega:</HI> The third gliding by degrees also West, is call'd <HI>Gambea;</HI> but the last Branch of <HI>Niger</HI> parts instantly into two other Branches, one of which is call'd <HI>Sante Domingo,</HI> and the other, which taketh its Course to the South, in <HI>Portuguese, Rio Grande.</HI> Each of these Branches boast of whole Kingdoms bordering their Banks, as <HI>Guihala</HI> and <HI>Biguba,</HI> according to the Name of those Rivers: <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> or <HI>The Great River,</HI> distinguishes it self from the other Rivers in eleven Degrees Latitude; and after having dis∣patch'd two Branches more from its own, which are call'd <HI>Guinala</HI> and <HI>Biguba,</HI> between the Islands of <HI>Bisegos,</HI> falls into the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Sante Domingo,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Jarim,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Sante Do∣mingo.</HI></NOTE> is held by some for the eminentest River of the whole Coast, because of the abundance of Slaves sold near its Banks. It seems to be a Branch of <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> which near the Bay call'd <HI>Esteirs Katerina,</HI> ends its Progress in the Sea. Many of the other Rivers, gliding down from the In-land, water the Coast of <HI>Negro-Land,</HI> and fall into the Ocean. But of these in their own particular place, as of the other Rivers, being Arms of <HI>Niger,</HI> as <HI>Zenega</HI> and <HI>Gambea,</HI> shall be treated of in the Kingdom <HI>Ze∣nega,</HI> between which they are included.</P>
<P>All these foremention'd Branches, and Sub-branches, swell and over-flow in the same manner, and near the same time with the <HI>Nyle,</HI> when the Sun in their Zenith enters <HI>Cancer:</HI> all the benefit the <HI>Nyle</HI> brings to <HI>Egypt,</HI> the like ac∣commodation the <HI>Niger,</HI> with other Rivers, brings to <HI>Negro-Land.

<P>The Countrey abounds in Corn, Rice, and Cattel; but they have no Grapes, nor other Fruits, except Mellons, Cucumbers, and Citrons, which are much used, having more than an ordinary relish.</P>
<P>This City, like others, is not without an inconvenience, being destitute of fresh Water, which they are forced to fetch out of Pits forty or fifty miles from the Town; yet this want is plentifully suppli'd by the abundance of Gold that is in this Kingdom, which, according to <HI>Meguet,</HI> is fetch'd from thence by the <HI>Moroccoans.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey people are not Bookish, taking no delight in Literature; for not one in three days Journey is to be found, that scarce knows one Letter of the Book: yet the Citizens are much civiller, and better taught than these Rusticks.</P>

<P><HI>Johannes Barros</HI> derives this Stream from certain Lakes lying in the East,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Head-Fountains.</NOTE> by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> nam'd <HI>Chelonides;</HI> the greatest whereof at present, is call'd <HI>Goaga,</HI> and the other <HI>Nuba.</HI> The Course of it is very long and straight, almost in a right line, till about seventeen miles above <HI>Cape de Verde,</HI> disemboguing into the Ocean.</P>
<P>In <HI>Zenega,</HI> though not so full of Water as <HI>Gambea,</HI> many Islands appear;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Islands of <HI>Zenega.</HI></NOTE> the greatest part whereof are full of Serpents and Wilde Beasts: Nor is it much profitable otherwise to such as inhabit near, being not passable in ma∣ny places, by reason of huge Rocks causing great and unusual Cataracts, like those of the <HI>Nyle;</HI> which some of the Inhabitants call <HI>Huaba;</HI> others, <HI>Burto,</HI> that is, a Bowe; because sometime the Water is carried up into the Air by the force of the Wind, in the manner of a Bowe.</P>
<P>Many other great Rivers run into this,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Vertue of two Rivers.</NOTE> especially one coming out of the South, and seeming to have Red-Water: between these two, they say, is such a strange Antipathy, that whoever drinks the Water of one, and presently that of the other, findes himself necessitated to vomit; yet neither of them produce this effect single, nor both together, after they have mingled their Streams, and run in one Channel.</P>
<P>Several kinds of Fishes and other Creatures breed herein, as the <HI>Hippopota∣mus,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Horse,</HI> Crocodiles, and Serpents with little Horns; yet notwithstand∣ing all these inconveniencies, the Water hath a Prolifick Quality, foecunda∣ting Cattel that drink of it.</P>
<P>¶ SIx miles Southward flows <HI>Borsalo,</HI> full of great dry Sholes or Sands;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Borsalo.</HI></NOTE> on both sides several Villages shew themselves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fountain-Springs.</NOTE> supply'd with fresh Water from a clear Spring that rises on the Easterly Shore,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tree four fatsiom thick.</NOTE> by a Tree above four Fathom thick: For the River Water, by the flowing of the Sea, is brackish near forty miles.</P>
<P>¶ NOt far from <HI>Punto Sereno</HI> floweth a small River, call'd <HI>Rio de la Grace,</HI> be∣ing a Border to the Kingdom of <HI>Ale;</HI> before whose Mouth lieth a Shelf, many times overflow'd by the Sea; from which (as soon as dry) fresh and sweet Water continually springs.</P>
<P>Somewhat more Southerly runs <HI>Bassangamar,</HI> full of great Rocks.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Bassangamar.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The next is <HI>Rio des Ostro's,</HI> or <HI>Oyster-River,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of Oysters.</NOTE> deep enough for the coming in of Ships.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Borsalo</HI> and <HI>Gambea,</HI> the Countrey all along is plain, but full of high Trees, yet wholly void of Inhabitants.</P>
<PB N="344" REF="222"/>
<P>About three miles from <HI>Jandos</HI> Northwards,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake <HI>Eutan.</HI></NOTE> is the Lake <HI>Eutan,</HI> six miles long, and half a mile broad. In time of Rain it abounds both with Wa∣ter and Fish, but in a dry Season so empty that they can go over dryshod. The bottom for the most part covered with <HI>Simbos,</HI> or pieces of Horn and Glass, which in <HI>Angola</HI> they use for Money.</P>
<P>Not far distant from hence is a Well of ten Fathom deep,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Well of sweet Water.</NOTE> sending forth so pleasant Water, as if it were dulcified with Sugar or Honey; from whence all the People fetch their drink: the other Wells, through the whole Coun∣trey are unwholsom.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants say,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange vertue in Wa∣ter.</NOTE> (and if true 'tis worth observation and enquiry) that there are streams of Water, of which, if the Horses or Camels drink, they die, but all other Beasts drink thereof without prejudice: of which the Natives can give no other reason, but that they have found it so by experience.</P>
<P>¶ THe whole Countrey is plain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Condition of the Soyl.</NOTE> and without doubt fit to bring forth all things in abundance; but it lies altogether uncultivated, for that <HI>Zenega</HI> and <HI>Gambea,</HI> by their over-flux in the Winter lay it wholly under Water; but in the Summer the heat of the Sun, and want of Moysture make therein parch'd Chops wide enough to bury a Horse. By these means the products of the Soyl are few, which may be attributed rather to the sloth and ignorance of the Inhabitants,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vegetables, or Plants. <HI>Sanus.</HI></NOTE> than the barrenness of the Earth: 'Tis true, about <HI>Cape Verde</HI> there grow Beans of an unusual bigness, besides Rice, <HI>Cardamoms,</HI> or Grains of Paradise, and Barley, each Grain as big as a Pease. The little Harvest they have is in <HI>September,</HI> when it rains there, and the Rivers swell over their Banks.</P>
<P>The most usual Grain is <HI>Mille,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mille,</HI> or <HI>Mais.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Indian Mais,</HI> which they put into the Earth dry, and onely cover it lightly with Sand, without any other labor bestowed upon it; by which sleight kind of Culture it grows and flourishes exceedingly, whereas, without that mixture of Sand, the Earth first by the overflowing of the Rivers, and the Rains made soft, and afterwards made over hard again by the violent heat of the Sun, is made barren, and uncapable of bearing.</P>
<P>They have no Wine but what is made of Palm, in high esteem among them: Some few places yield Dates, and a sort of Oyl that gives a yellow tincture to all that it is put into, or mingled with.</P>
<P>Close by <HI>Porto d' Ale</HI> lieth a Wood call'd <HI>Tapa,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wood <HI>Tapa.</HI></NOTE> full of high Trees, which give pleasant and delightful shade, under which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have their abode, and shelter themselves from the scorching beams of the Sun.</P>
<P>Tobacco grows there wild,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tobacco.</NOTE> without Planting; whose green Leaves plucked off, the People suck or chew with great delectation. And certainly, if these People could be brought to labor, they might propagate, not onely Tobacco, but all other Plants in abundance.</P>
<P><HI>Tamerindes</HI> grow here also,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamerindes.</NOTE> and <HI>Anana's,</HI> but few Oranges and Lemmons; yet there is another Fruit call'd <HI>Foles,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fruit call'd <HI>Foles.</HI></NOTE> in bigness and colour like an Orange, but differing in taste, being sowre and full of great Seeds.</P>
<P>There grows also a wild Fruit like Dates, but smaller, yet very sweet; out of which Wine is pressed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sebanken</HI>-Wine.</NOTE> but inferior to that of the Palm.</P>
<P><HI>Syby</HI>-Trees afford Wine also, but of great esteem, and Fruit like a <HI>Coco</HI>-Nut, but much smaller.</P>
<P><HI>Kakatons</HI> are a great soft round Fruit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kakatons.</NOTE> outwardly of a dark-green colour, and tart Juice.</P>
<PB N="345" REF="222"/>
<P><HI>Naniples</HI> resembles a Pear-Plumb, yellow without, and soft, having a Juice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naniples.</NOTE> whose pleasant sharpness, and cooling quality, makes it useful in several hot Distempers, if mingled with Water.</P>
<P><HI>Nompata</HI>'s grow to the bigness of a Wallnut, upon high Trees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nompata.</NOTE> sweet in taste, and of a greenish colour.</P>
<P><HI>Tambakumba,</HI> somewhat bigger Fruit than the former,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tambakumba.</NOTE> is hot and unpleasant of taste.</P>
<P>Cotton also is naturally produced more than what the Inhabitants know what to do with, and would grow in great abundance,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotton.</NOTE> if managed with Art and Industry.</P>
<P>There grows also in great abundance small Trees, about three Foot high,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arbre-Tint.</NOTE> call'd <HI>Arbre-Tint,</HI> whose Leaves bruised, yield a blue Colour, wherewith the Natives Dye their Cloathes; the manner thus:</P>
<P>Of the Leaves, which in the Morning when the Dew lieth yet upon them, they pull off, and immediately stamp in a Mortar, they make Cakes as big as ones Fist, they being dri'd in the Sun divers days, are often pulverised very fine, and then put into Earthen Pots: upon these Pots they set others bigger, having a little hole at the bottom fill'd with Ashes of the same Tree, mixed with Water, which they let drop through the Vent into the lower Pot, upon the common Colour: this moistened stuff they set ten days in the Sun, then scum off the uppermost, which is the best, and therewith colour the finest, and with the undermost the coursest Cloathes. The Dregs remaining are thrown away.</P>
<P>¶ THe Countrey is exceedingly stock'd with Cattel, especially Kine,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cattel.</NOTE> as appears by the Hides, wherein their chiefest Trade consists, which are Transported into <HI>Europe:</HI> The Herdsmen are found to drive them from place to place for change of Pasture, by reason of the driness of the Ground.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Baool,</HI> call'd <HI>Luchi Four,</HI> keeps above six thousand Oxen; the like do the Nobility, and others, according to their ability. There are also Camels, small <HI>Muletto's,</HI> Asses, Horses, Goats, and Sheep, with Hair like Dogs: And the Woods feed many Stags, Harts, and other Deer, with crooked Horns like Rams-horns.</P>
<P>There is a strange Beast, in Body like a Hog, but Footed like a Badger, that creeps in the Earth like a Mole, and feeds on Ants, or Pismires, neither yield∣ing them profit, nor doing any damage. Here are also Hares, Civet-Cats, Dogs, and Apes.</P>
<P>The Wilderness that borders upon the Kingdoms of <HI>Cayor</HI> and <HI>Borsalo,</HI> breed many wild Beasts, as Lyons, Tygers, Leopards, Wolves, Elephants and <HI>Alaka∣rons,</HI> being Creatures like Crabs, with two Claws, and a Sting in their Tails, like Scorpions, for fear of which the Inhabitants, when they travel through these desolate ways, make great Fires in the night to secure their persons. Nor are the wild Beasts all that trouble these Wastes, for there are Thieves farther therein, altogether as savage and inhumane as those other Beasts of Prey.</P>
<P>The Fowls there far exceed in number the Beasts, such are <HI>Popinjay's, Parrots, Paraqueeto's,</HI> some small, others very large, with Ash-coloured Necks, and green and yellow Bodies, Geese, Ducks, Herons, Partridges, with black and white spots; and in Fenny places, Snipes, Wild-Ducks, and many other small Fowl, common with us in <HI>Europe.</HI> Such as we know not, nor have yet seen, are the <HI>Akkaviak,</HI> as big as a Turky, with a red tuft of Feathers upon their
<PB N="346" REF="223"/>Crown, which they can raise like Bristles, and spread so, that they will hang over their Eyes; Hearons white and black, and large as Eagles, but not regard∣ed, because they eat nothing but Mans-dung. Pelicans, with Necks so great and long as a Mans Arm.</P>
<P>Nor is the Land more productive of Beasts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishes.</NOTE> than the Water is of Fish, whereof there is great variety; especially of Carps, Crabs, Pikes, Herrings, and other like; Salmon onely differing in the whiteness of their flesh.</P>
<P>In the River <HI>De la Grace,</HI> many Crocodiles breed, which frequently coming on Land, lye basking in the Sun; but upon the sight or approach of men in∣stantly (as if afraid) return into the Covert of the Water.</P>
<P>When the People which dwell on the Sea-Coasts are straitned of Provision, by the scarcity of Harvest, they supply themselves with Fish, going with their <HI>Canoo's,</HI> (wherein three persons may sit) out to Sea, without regard of Wind or Weather.</P>
<P>¶ LOcusts abound here in such prodigious numbers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insects.</NOTE> flying over in <HI>June</HI> out of the North-East, that they cover the Sky, and darken the Sun, de∣vouring all the ripe Plants; so that many In-land People starve to death; and others for the preservation of their lives, sell themselves to the <HI>Portugals</HI> for Slaves, as it happen'd in the Year Sixteen hundred forty one.</P>
<P>Serpents breed here in too great abundance;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents.</NOTE> among which the most poi∣sonous are of a Grass-green Colour; others frequent the Dwellings of the People, being very harmless, and of great use in destroying Rats and Mice: These the <HI>Negro's</HI> will not permit any to kill, believing that their deceased Ancestors are metamorphosed into such; and that it is fatal for any to hurt them. When any is bitten with one of the venomous kind, he immediately makes address to a Charmer, who cures them by Inchantment. But if the Witch be abroad, he leaves a piece of Wood at his Door; which upon touch∣ing effects the desire of the party infected. Some will leap up at a man, and twining round about his body, girt him to death; others suck the milk out of the Cows Udders; and some are so prodigiously great, that they can swal∣low a Buck whole, Horns and all.</P>
<P>Here breeds a sort of Creatures call'd <HI>Leguanes,</HI> which make good Food; as also <HI>Efts</HI> or <HI>Lyzards,</HI> which nesting in the Walls, run over people when they sleep, causing Boyls to rise in the places they touch.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Beyhourt,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt in the River of <HI>Ze∣nega.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>French Fort,</HI> the whole ground in the bottom of the River <HI>Zenega,</HI> is grown over with Salt, which they break up in great pieces with Irons, and dry it on the Land: thus dried, it grows very white; and which is more, that if all be taken up one day, the next will afford the like quantity; so that it is a perpetual Store-house of that necessary Com∣modity; nor are the quantities small, but sufficient to serve the whole Coun∣trey, whereinto 'tis carried upon Camels. The Profit arising hereby, the King of <HI>Cayor</HI> hath bestowed on his Priests; who for a Last of it, which is a Camels Load, take a <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> Garment, and a Tub full of <HI>Mille.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Inhabitants exceed in Blackness those that dwell on the Coast of <HI>Mina</HI> and <HI>Angola;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kinds of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> well set, and keep themselves very clean by fre∣quent Lotions, and daily Washings: but withall are sullen and stubborn.</P>
<P>The Men are of various dispositions, and the Women light and unconstant, of a craving humor, affecting best where they find most advantage: when
<PB N="347" REF="223"/>they speak they thrust forward their Necks, and utter their words in a furious tone: In brief, they are in general by nature very wanton, thievish, treacher∣ous and lying, esteeming it a credit ingeniously to betray; unconstant, beyond measure jealous, and so voracious Gluttons, that they may be said to devour rather than eat.</P>
<P>They have great propensity to, and skill in Sorcery,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their propersity to Sor∣cery.</NOTE> so that they can charm Serpents, as we hinted before, whose venomous blood they take, and mingling with the Seed of a Tree, empoyson their Weapons with it, whose effect is so mortal, that who-ever is wounded therewith dies in half an hour. They believe farther, that they can bewitch any in such manner, as to cause them to die of a languishing Disease.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Ivala,</HI> call'd <HI>Walla Silla,</HI> as they report, in eight or ten days can bring together, if need require, five thousand Men, whereof about six hun∣dred Horse: a great many, considering the whole Countrey doth not con∣tain above fifty or sixty miles.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Camino</HI> are Warlike, and keep themselves Neuters be∣tween the two Kings of <HI>Baool</HI> and <HI>Kayor,</HI> by that means corresponding with both, and suffering by neither.</P>
<P>¶ THeir Houses are small and round, running up to a Point like a Cap;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> within which are places raised about a Foot and a half from the Ground, covered with a Matt, whereon they sleep, casting over them another Matt of Bull-rushes in stead of a Coverlet.</P>
<P>¶ NEither the King of <HI>Zenega,</HI> nor any other, have any Wall'd Cities,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Wall'd Cities in <HI>Ze∣nega.</HI></NOTE> For∣tifications, or Palaces; the best Habitations being onely round Stru∣ctures made of Sticks, fetcht out of the Woods, about three Fathom above the Ground, encompassed with a Fence of Reeds, and covered with Straw, ha∣ving a low Door, so that without stooping none can go in or out.</P>
<P>Their Houshold-stuff is onely Arms, Axes to cut Wood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houshold-stuff.</NOTE> an Iron Spade to throw up the Earth withall in stead of Ploughs, and some Earthen Pots: to which the Sea-Coasters adde Nets, and other Necessaries belonging to Fishing.</P>
<P>¶ THeir greatest Employment, as to matter of getting a Livelihood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Maintenance.</NOTE> is Digging, keeping of Cattel, and Fishing: some few follow Mer∣chandizing, while others busie themselves either at the Forge, making Horse∣shoes and Arms for the War, or in Weaving: in both which (though their Ma∣sterpieces) yet are they but mean Workmen.</P>
<P>In the Village <HI>Kandina</HI> all the Men are Fishers, and the Women Mer∣chants.</P>
<P>They live quiet, but poorly, and trouble themselves neither with pride,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They earnestly mind til∣ling of the Ground.</NOTE> nor over-working themselves, onely in Seed-time they go diligently to order the Ground, and sow <HI>Mille,</HI> whereof in three Moneths time they receive the Crop: and if they prove negligent in that, it turns to their great shame and disgrace; for the greatest Men in the Countrey accompany their Labourers in the Field.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Mille</HI> is cut up and brought into the Barn,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mille</HI> cut up, how order∣ed by the Women.</NOTE> the Women by stamping it in a wooden Mortar, separate it from the Chaff, then cleansing it in the Wind, they put it in Straw Baskets of about three Fathoms wide, and seven <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/></P>

<P><HI>Refrisco,</HI> one of the chiefest places for Trade, on the Sea-Coast, affords Salt-Hides, but smaller and sleighter than <HI>Porto d' Ale.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sanutus</HI> says, that the Inhabitants about <HI>Cape de Verde,</HI> Pasture so many Cat∣tel, that oftentimes whole Ships are fraighted with Hides from the <HI>Haven of Ale,</HI> in exchange of other Commodities; and that besides they have Amber∣greece, Gum-Arabick, Leather, Gold, Silver, Ivory, Salt, Civet, and Wax.</P>
<P>In the Town of <HI>Geroep</HI> a Market is held every forty days, where Cloathes, Cotton, Tobacco, Slaves, Horses, Camels, and other Beasts, with all sort of Provisions for Food, are bought.</P>
<P>The like is in <HI>Kamino,</HI> where is also a continual Mart for Hides and Cloathes; and commonly two Hides are given for a Bar of Iron: But Christal Beads, and Brandy-Wine are the most ready Traffick, especially with such as dwell more towards the In-land.</P>
<P>In <HI>Jawesil</HI> is a weekly Fair of Hides, Cows, Goats, Hens, <HI>Mille,</HI> and all edible Commodities. Of this Market, call'd <HI>Gambayar,</HI> a Noble-man has the supervising, who appoints Deputy-Clerks of the Market under him at certain Rents.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wares brought over from <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>Zenega.</HI></NOTE> and carried over thither out of <HI>Europe,</HI> are these following, of which Brandy and Iron are the chief: for they use great quantities of Iron to make Bowes and Arrows, Harping-Irons, Assagay's, Javelins, and other Utensils for their Fishing Trade, Tillage, and Husbandry.</P>

<P>All these Wares are commonly packt in little Chests, which are there bar∣ter'd for good advantage; the Commodities received in Exchange, we men∣tioned before.</P>
<P>¶ THe Weapons and Arms of the <HI>Jalofs</HI> are Lances, Bowes and Arrows made of Iron-Plates; a kind of <HI>Turkish</HI> Scimiter, crook'd like a Bowe; round and broad Shields made of very hard Skins; Darts, which they shoot in long Bowes made of Canes.</P>
<P>Others carry a great Shield made of Oxe-Hides, with a Scimiter and great Knife by their side, a long Assagay or Javelin, with two other short Darts, by them call'd <HI>Sinchirin;</HI> which by the help of a loop fastened in the middle of it, wherein they put one finger, they can throw very steady, and with great swiftness and strength.</P>
<P>They have a sort of small Horses for service, which they know how to ride with great dexterity. The <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> sometimes carry their Horses thither, and sell them to the <HI>Blacks;</HI> every Horse for ten, twelve, or thirteen Slaves, each Slave accompted for nine and twenty Bars of Iron. These Horses, as soon as they have them, they charm by a certain peculiar method of Incantation, believing by that means they shall pass shot-free in the Wars.</P>
<P>Such Horsemen as follow the Wars, mount and dismount with such active agility as is admirable; for they can in full speed stand upright on the Saddle, turn this way and that way, stand upon their hands, bow their bodies, lie down on their sides, and take up any thing from the earth.</P>
<P>Their Arms are Scimiters, long Javelins with long Iron-points, wherewith they strike, holding it in their hands without casting.</P>
<P>The Wars are seldom undertaken out of ambition, or for honor, or man∣nag'd with design to subject others, but principally out of revenge, and that extends onely to the burning of some Towns: if at any time they come to a Battel, the greatest fury thereof vents it self on the one side to take, on the other to keep the Royal Drum, by them call'd <HI>Omlambe,</HI> and in no less esteem there with them, then the Royal Standard of the Eagle with the old <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The present King of <HI>Ivala,</HI> a free and loving Prince, courteous towards Strangers, is constrained to be always in a posture of Defence against the King of <HI>Baool,</HI> a Tyrant, and delighting in cruelty and oppression.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>Ale</HI> intends to War upon his Neighbours, he calls a Council, with whom he Treats in a Wood close by the Palace, in which they sit about a round Hole three Foot deep, with their Heads hanging down. This Hole they cover after the rising of the Council: for the King saith, <HI>That the Hole will never disclose his Secrets,</HI> letting them understand thereby, that none shall know what their Determination is. By this means, and for fear of be∣ing punisht as Traitors and betrayers of their Countrey, their Enemies can never learn ought of their Resolution till it be brought to effect; which with∣out doubt is the chiefest cause of their success.</P>
<P>Their Government is not Hereditary, from Father to Son,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inheritance of the Crown.</NOTE> but three or four Grandees elect a King amongst them of the noblest Stock, whom sometime
<PB N="352" REF="225"/>presently after the Election they drive out of the Countrey again upon the least distaste.</P>
<P>When the King dies, his eldest Brother takes upon him the Dominion; and after his Decease, all his other Brothers successively; and when they are all dead at last, the Children, according to their degree of age; or for want of Children, the eldest Son of his Brother.</P>
<P>The Subjects shew great honour and respect to their Kings,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Respect of the Sub∣jects to their Kings.</NOTE> using many Ceremonies when they come into his Presence, saluting him first afar off upon their Knees, bowing down to the Earth, and with both Hands cast Sand upon their Heads and Shoulders, thus they creep forwards kneeling till they come within two Paces of him, and then speak; having said what they in∣tended, the King answers in few words with great state.</P>
<P>When any Noble-man comes to the King, he puts off his Shirt, and lays it upon his right Shoulder and Arm, appearing onely in his close Coat, call'd by them <HI>Joula,</HI> and so draws near to the King; who is always attended with a great Train of Courtiers and other Servants, who, as a Guard to his Person, are Armed with Assagay's, and other Weapons of Defence.</P>
<P>Every Town on the Coast of <HI>Cape Verde</HI> hath an <HI>Algayere,</HI> or <HI>Alkaid,</HI> set there by the King of <HI>Cayor,</HI> to receive the Custom of Foreign Ships, that is, three Bars of Irons for each Vessel; but when they find any Merchants unexperien∣ced in their Modes, they extort as much as they can get; besides, every Ship pays to the <HI>Alkaid</HI> for their Water ten Bars of Iron, or the like value in other Merchandise, and sometimes a Cask of Brandy-Wine.</P>
<P>In the Year fourteen hundred fifty and five,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings of <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> are call'd <HI>Burdomel.</HI></NOTE> a great Prince named <HI>Burdomel</HI> had Dominion over all the places about <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> from whom, ever since, all the Kings of <HI>Cape Verde</HI> in general are call'd <HI>Burdomel,</HI> as the <HI>Roman</HI> Empe∣rors were stiled <HI>Caesar,</HI> and the great <HI>Egyptian</HI> Monarchs <HI>Pharaoh</HI> at first, and af∣terwards <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> The proper Name of the present King is <HI>Daur,</HI> but by the addition of that Royal Title which signifies King, call'd <HI>Burdomel Daur.</HI></P>

<P>¶ HEre are no peculiar or Municipal Laws;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law of the Coun∣trey.</NOTE> for indeed the Law or light of Nature is the onely Rule they steer by: for when a Man dies, and leaves behind him Wives, Children, Cattel, Slaves, and Iron, wherein their chiefest Riches consists, the Brothers and Sisters of the Deceased take all, with∣out any consideration of the Children, whom they leave to the wide World to help themselves as well as they can.</P>
<P>As to matters of distributive Justice, or punishments of Crimes, they are in a manner strangers to both; the greatest extravagancies being bought off, and pardoned by paying of Slaves, or some other Mulct to the King.</P>
<P>¶ THeir Religion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Religion.</NOTE> if so we may call it, is generally <HI>Paganism;</HI> for they greet the New-Moon with horrible roarings, and strange gestures of adoration: they offer their Sacrifices in the Woods before great hollow Trees, wherein they have placed Idols: and this they do rather out of custom then zeal, using neither form nor method in their Devotions, nor any particular Assemblies, but every one following the dictates of his own humor, makes a God in his own Fancy, which is as often varied as their Lusts or Passions raises in them other motions: Some of them seem to incline to <HI>Mahumetanism,</HI>
<PB N="353" REF="225"/>and admit among them some <HI>Marabouts;</HI> but so little have they prevailed upon them, that they know not what the <HI>Sala</HI> means, nor do the Priests any other Service than write <HI>Arabick</HI> Characters on small Papers, which sew'd in little Leather Purses, are worn by the <HI>Blacks</HI> on their Necks, Arms, Legs, Heads, and every part of their Bodies in great numbers, firmly believing, that there∣by, in time to come, they shall be freed of all troubles and dangers, to the great gain of the <HI>Marabouts,</HI> who sell them at no small Prices. And although they know there is a God, yet have they no understanding to worship him: and use Circumcision the fifth or sixth Year; and then, if they be asked the reason thereof, they can give no other account, but that it is an antient Custom recei∣ved among them, but farther know not.</P>
<P>None of the Priests are permitted to Marry but in their own Families, nor may teach any to Read or Write without the chief <HI>Marabout</HI>'s Licence.</P>
<P>They hold the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion in great abomination, affirming, that God who giveth all things, and can do what he pleaseth, and causes Thunder, Lightning, Rain and Wind, is Omnipotent, and needs neither praying to, nor to be set forth in so mysterious a way as that of the Trinity: and thus <HI>Hea∣thenism</HI> and <HI>Idolatry</HI> generally possesses the whole Countrey.</P>

<HEAD>THE KINGDOM OF GAMBEA, CASSAN, CANTOR, AND BORSALO.</HEAD>
<P>ADjoyning to <HI>Zenega</HI> on the North is <HI>Gambea,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kingdom of <HI>Gam∣bea.</HI></NOTE> a small Kingdom by the River of the same name. On the other side of the River <HI>Gambea</HI> lies the Jurisdiction of <HI>Cassan, Great Cantor,</HI> and <HI>Borsalo,</HI> all heretofore subject to the King of <HI>Mandimanza,</HI> but now have Princes as absolute as himself, and ac∣knowledging no Superior.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Great Cantor</HI> keeps his Residence continually on the Southerly Shore of the River <HI>Gambea,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Canter.</HI></NOTE> having many inferior Dominions under his Obe∣dience.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Borsalo</HI> commands on the North-side of the same River to <HI>Tan∣takonde.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Borsalo.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Both these Princes have several populous Towns belonging to them, but,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Towns lying on <HI>Gambea.</HI></NOTE> as we said, all without Walls, and scituate on both the Shores of <HI>Gambea,</HI> which
<PB N="354" REF="226"/>like the <HI>Nyle,</HI> overflowing it Banks, much enriches and fertilitates the neigh∣bouring Soyl.</P>
<P>The Sea-Coast hereabouts shooting from the South is very low, and in that regard, unless in very clear weather, hard to be known; but more forward the Land rises high, is full of Trees, and spreads North-East and South-West.</P>
<P>At the Mouth of this River stands the Town <HI>Barra;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barra.</NOTE> so named, because every Ship that comes thither must give a Bar of Iron, which they call <HI>Bar∣ra,</HI> to the King of <HI>Borsalo.</HI></P>
<P>Above the South-Point stands a Town call'd <HI>Nabare,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabare.</NOTE> within a Wood.</P>
<P>Three miles higher on the same Point lieth a Town call'd <HI>Bintam,</HI> inhabited by the <HI>Portugals.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bintam.</NOTE> On the South-side of the River, twenty miles from the Mouth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tankerval. Tendeba.</NOTE> appears <HI>Tankerval;</HI> and not far thence a Town call'd <HI>Tendeba,</HI> twelve miles from which last may be seen <HI>Jayre,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jayre.</NOTE> in a narrow Creek.</P>
<P>Half a mile beyond the Creek, on the South-side, lieth the River and Town call'd <HI>Jambay,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jambay. Mansibaer. Barraconda.</NOTE> with another named <HI>Mansibaer,</HI> on the North.</P>
<P>In the last place you come to <HI>Barraconda,</HI> above which the Sea floweth not; so that whoever will go higher, must Row against the Stream.</P>
<P>After a tedious and toilsom Journey of ten days you arrive at <HI>Tinda;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tinda.</NOTE> above which stands <HI>Joliet;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joliet. Munkbaer.</NOTE> and six days Journey from that a City call'd <HI>Munkbaer,</HI> to which, without great hazards, there is no coming; from whence in nine days you come to the City <HI>Jayr,</HI> and so to <HI>Silico,</HI> an In-land Town, yet a place of great Trade.</P>
<P>Five and fifty miles within the Land stands <HI>Borsalo;</HI> and eighty five miles, <HI>Little Cassan;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Small Cassan. Groat Cassan.</NOTE> three miles above which the vast and great City <HI>Cassan</HI> shews it self, whose side is washed by the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, and where the King keeps his Court.</P>
<P>¶ AMong other Rivers that water these Countreys,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Gambea.</HI></NOTE> one of the principal is <HI>Gambea,</HI> or <HI>Gambia,</HI> so call'd by the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> after the example of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> who call all the Tracts of Land, reaching from the Mouth of it to the <HI>Gold-Coast Gambu.</HI> Its Mouth is about three miles broad, hath five fathom Wa∣ter, and lies in thirteen Degrees and nineteen Minutes North Latitude, between the <HI>Zenega</HI> and <HI>Rio Grande.</HI></P>
<P>It draws the original from the great River <HI>Niger,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Original.</NOTE> at the place where it makes a great Lake, and divides in four branches, which are afterwards named <HI>Zenega, Gambea, Sante Domingo,</HI> and the <HI>Great River;</HI> all which after several long courses, having visited and refreshed these hot Countreys with their pleasant Streams, at last near <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> pour forth their Waters into the <HI>Great Ocean;</HI> but especially <HI>Gambea,</HI> with so strong a Current, and such abundance of Water, that sixteen miles in the Sea (as they say) that Water may be taken up.</P>
<P>They may row up in this River against the Stream near a hundred miles; but then are stopped with a strong Water-fall, which with an impetuous noise pours down over the Rocks, and by that means becomes unpassable. The Channel is for the most part very broad, especially from the <HI>Gold-Coast</HI> of <HI>Cantor</HI> or <HI>Reskate,</HI> to its Mouth; and by the receiving of many other Streams becomes full of water; and gliding also easier by reason of the breadth, to the great ease of all Vessels that go up against the Stream.</P>
<P>By the Village <HI>Tinga,</HI> the River is fordable, but none dare venture to wade through it, but the <HI>Blacks,</HI> for fear of the Crocodiles; however on both its Shores are many Villages, and within its bosome divers small Islands.</P>
<PB N="355" REF="226"/>
<P>Twelve miles upwards of <HI>Tondebu,</HI> half a mile above the Creek <HI>Jayre</HI> on the left hand, lies a little Island, betwixt the which and the main Land, the Stream is no broader than a Musquet-shot, shallow, and runs in many Mean∣ders, but higher on the left side is four or five fathom deep.</P>
<P>About two miles about <HI>Mansibaer,</HI> lies another Island, that so straightens the passage, that without great trouble they cannot go through it.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Nabare,</HI> half way between the Mouth of the River and the Gold place of <HI>Cantor</HI> or <HI>Reskate,</HI> lieth <HI>Elephant-Island,</HI> so call'd, for the great number of Elephants which breed there.</P>
<P>¶ THe Air in this Countrey is continually hot,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air.</NOTE> though with some little variation from the beginning of <HI>June</HI> till the end of <HI>September,</HI> in which time it rains every day at Noon; and at Night from the East and South-East, continual Lightnings and Thunder.</P>
<P>But the greatest Rains falls from <HI>May</HI> till the beginning of <HI>August,</HI> which causes the Rivers to swell and overflow their Banks, and that proves a very unhealthful time; for the first Rains falling upon the naked people, cause blotches and spots, and on the Clothes of the <HI>Whites,</HI> it breeds Worms, but after a little time that inconvenience vanishes.</P>
<P>¶ ALl along the Banks of <HI>Gambea,</HI> and about <HI>Cassan,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vegetables or Plants.</NOTE> Tobacco</HI> grows plenti∣fully, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> fetch with Sloops both green and dried, without making up in Rolls; Cotton also, with Mille, Rice, Lemons, Oran∣ges, Apples, and <HI>Ananasses,</HI> but not in such abundance as some have written.</P>
<P>On the Sea-Coast are Trees above seventeen Paces in compass, and not twenty in height; whereas further into the Countrey, they are tall and slender.</P>
<P>¶ BEasts fit for labour and service breeding here, are Camels,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beasts.</NOTE> small Horses and Asses: But they have besides many Cows and Oxen, as appears by their Hides yearly brought into <HI>Europe;</HI> as also Goats, Sheep, Deer red and fallow, with divers others, besides the Wilde Beasts found in the Wildernesses, <HI>viz.</HI> Lyons, Tygers, Baboons, Otters, Elephants, and the like.</P>
<P>This plenty of Cattel makes Provision in those places so cheap, that about <HI>Gambea</HI> you may buy a Beast of three or four hundred weight for a Bar of Iron, although at <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> they pay four or five Bars for the like.</P>
<P>¶ THe people heretofore were savage and cruel, but since they have in some sort by the Converse of Christian Merchants, received some notions of Religion, they are become tractable and courteous.</P>
<P>The Kings (as we said) keep a Majestick Port, according to their manner of State, seldom appearing in publick to their Subjects.</P>
<P>They are all great lovers of Brandy, and will drink thereof even to excess:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their propensity to Brandy.</NOTE> And if any Forreigner, Merchant, or other, desires Audience of the King, he can by no means sooner effect it, than by presenting him with a Bottel of Brandy.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Great Cassan</HI> call'd <HI>Magro,</HI> who spoke the <HI>Portugal</HI> Tongue,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Cassan</HI> a great Sorcerer.</NOTE> yet could not be won to <HI>Christianity,</HI> was well skill'd in <HI>Necromantick</HI> Arts, whereof one <HI>Block</HI> in a Journal of his Travels gives a particular account: We will onely instance in one or two of his prestigious actions. He commonly wore as many inchanted Chains without trouble, as would have over-loaden a
<PB N="356" REF="227"/>strong Man. One time, to shew his Art, he caused a strong Wind to blow, but confined it onely to designed limits, so that the next adjoyning places were not sensible of any violent motion. Another time desiring to be resolved of some questioned particular, after his Charms a smoke and flame arose out of the Earth, by which he gathered the answer to his demand.</P>
<P>¶ MOst of the Wealth of the Inhabitants consists in Slaves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Riches.</NOTE> though some have Gold; for among them are few Artificers, and those that are, onely Weavers and Smiths,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificers</NOTE> who are ill provided of Tools for their Work, yet make shift therewith. The Smiths make short Swords, and knowing how to harden the Iron, form the Heads of their Assagay's or Lances, Darts or Ar∣rows, and all sorts of Instruments with which they Dig the Earth. Their Bellows are a thick Reed, or hollow piece of Wood, in which is put a Stick wound about with Feathers, which by the moving of the Stick makes the Wind. The Iron which they Forge is brought over out of <HI>Europe</HI> thi∣ther in Bars, in Pieces of eight or ten Inches long, and are exchanged with great gain in barter for their In-land Commodities. The Weavers make Cloathes of Cotton, which by the Merchants are carried to <HI>Serre-Lions, Serbore,</HI> and the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> and there barter'd for Ivory, red Wood, and Gold. These Cloathes, because made also about <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> are call'd <HI>Cape de Verde Cloathes;</HI> being of three sorts: the best and chiefest, call'd <HI>Panossakes,</HI> are two Ells and a half long, and an Ell and a half broad, whitened upon the Ground, and with Lists commonly of eight Bands sew'd together: the second <HI>Bontans,</HI> two Ells long, and an Ell and a half broad, very neatly Strip'd, having six Lifts sew'd together: but the third sort, named <HI>Berfoel,</HI> are great Cloathes, made with blue Stripes: all which are commonly bought for Iron, that is, one <HI>Panossakes</HI> for one Bar of Iron, three <HI>Bontans</HI> for two Bars, and two great <HI>Bar∣foel</HI> Cloathes for one Bar.</P>
<P>¶ EVery one,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tillage.</NOTE> be he Spiritual or Temporal, old or young, must Till his own Ground, if he intends to eat, the King onely, and some chief Nobles, and antient decrepid people excepted: for the doing whereof they use no Ploughs, but dig the Earth with a kind of Mattocks in the time of their Rain, because then the Ground is softened.</P>
<P>¶ THeir Food is <HI>Mille,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> Shell-Fruit, Milk, and some Flesh. They Bake no Bread, but boyl it as we in these Countreys do Puddings, which they eat hot. Their Drink is <HI>Palmito</HI>-Wine, and for want of that, Water; but the Priests with their whole Families drink no sort of strong Drink, but only Water.</P>
<P>¶ THe Houses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> like those in <HI>Zenega,</HI> are onely round Huts, with Walls of Reed, Lime, and Earth, covered with Canes, and environ'd with a <HI>Pallisado,</HI> or Hedge of Canes.</P>
<P>¶ THe Habit of this People,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloathes. <HI>Sanutu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> as well Men as Women, is onely a Shirt that reaches down to their Knees, with long wide Sleeves, a pair of Cotton Breeches, and little white Hats, with a Plume of Feathers in the mid∣dle. The Maidens cut and prick their Breasts, Thumbs, Arms, and Necks, with Needles, in fashion of Embroidery, and burn in these marks that they may not wear out; those works being esteemed a great Ornament.</P>
<PB N="357" REF="227"/>
<P>Their Arms are the same as we mention'd before in <HI>Zenega: Sanutus</HI> says, they are very warlike and stout, which they have often manifested, when in their little <HI>Almadyes</HI> they adventur'd to board some <HI>Portugal Carvils,</HI> without re∣gard either to their Canon or other Arms. For though these <HI>Blacks</HI> have no hopes of Victory, and many of them are slain, yet they regard not their lives, nor ever run away from the Fight.</P>
<P>They work also their <HI>Almadyes</HI> and <HI>Canoos</HI> with such dexterity, that they force them forward with incredible nimbleness, and betake themselves upon the approach of Ships which they think will damnifie them, to the mouth of some small River.</P>

<P>In Exchange of these Commodities the Merchants receive Hides, Ivory, Gold, and other Merchandises.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Cassan</HI> gives liberty and freedom to the <HI>English, Portugals, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> to come in his Countrey, and to traffick there.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants themselves in divers places trade one amongst the other.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Cape de Verde, Refrisko, Porto de Ale,</HI> and <HI>Ivala,</HI> come with Sloops to this River <HI>Gambta,</HI> and buy Hides, Wax, Elephants Teeth, Rice, Gold, Cotton-Clothes, <HI>Blacks,</HI> and Tobacco, which they barter and exchange, some to <HI>Europe,</HI> some up higher into the Countrey, to their no small profit and gain.</P>
<P>In the Village <HI>Tinga</HI> are some Hides and Teeth; so also in <HI>Tankerval</HI> and <HI>Tondeba,</HI> together with Rice and Cotton.</P>
<P>In the Village of <HI>Mansigaer</HI> in the middle of <HI>February,</HI> is held a Fair,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Market or Fair in <HI>Man∣sigaer.</HI></NOTE> where∣to resort many people out of divers Countreys, with Mats, Hens, Bucks, Cows, Cotton, and Salt; yet does not this Commerce bring thither riches, or many Inhabitants, being wholly possessed by a few poor <HI>Portugueses</HI> and <HI>Mu∣latto's.</HI> The principal Merchandises to be had there, are Wax, Hides, Ele∣phants Teeth, and a little Gold brought thither out of the In-land Countrey. Here also is kept every Monday in a plain Field, a petty Market, where every one brings to sell what he is minded to dispose of. And in case they want Money, they exchange all other things for Matts.</P>
<PB N="358" REF="228"/>
<P>In <HI>Cassan</HI> are two yearly Fairs, whither come a great concourse of People to buy and sell all sorts of Wares, nay Gold it self. The <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Mulata's</HI> that scatteringly inhabit by the River side, send their Slaves into the Countrey with Iron and Beads, to buy Hides and Ivory, which they carry on their Heads, and bring to the River.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> come in great numbers, with Camels to Trade at <HI>Yaye</HI> for Gold, whereof that Countrey affords great store, and return home richly laden with it.</P>
<P>The manner of dealing between these People and the before-mentioned <HI>Arabians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Trade is driven by the People of <HI>Taye.</HI></NOTE> in exchange of their Goods, is this: They of <HI>Barbary</HI> go to an appoint∣ed place, where they lay their Wares in several heaps, distinct one from the other; which done, they go away and return not for a whole day: in the mean times the Natives come, and lay over against every heap as much Gold as they value the Parcels at, then go away, leaving on the place both their own Gold and the Merchants Goods; who upon his return finding that he hath his value in Gold, takes it away and leaves his Merchandise; but if he expects more, he divides his heaps, and lets them so remain; which the People seeing, lay more Gold, or if they think not fit to give more, they take that away which they laid there first: thus in three times the Bargain is driven and ended. The reason why the People will not be seen, is the loathsomness of their Bodies; for their lower Parts, through the excessive scorching of the Sun, are always raw and sore, in such manner, that if it were not for sprinkling them with Salt, they would rot; and that is the cause why they so much desire Salt.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>TInda</HI> yields great abundance of Hides, but the trouble, and almost im∣possibility of coming up the River with great Vessels, very much hinder Trade; besides Iron bears not so good a Rate there as in other places, because the Inhabitants say, they have Ore thereabouts, of which they can make it: But Salt is a most desirable Commodity, not onely there, but in∣deed over all the Countrey. At the first discovery of these Places they carried thither a bad and blackish Salt, which went off well enough; but since the People have gained skill and knowledge so to distinguish, that they will not deal for it, but onely for the whitest; in exchange whereof they give Slaves, Hides, Elephants Teeth, Cotton, Cotton-Yarn, Cotton-Cloathes, and Gold.</P>
<P>In the City <HI>Joliet,</HI> lying beyond <HI>Tinda,</HI> there is, as the <HI>Blacks</HI> relate, abun∣dance of Gold; and the like at a Place call'd <HI>Munkbar:</HI> whither also the <HI>Arabi∣ans</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> come, with Camels laden with Salt, and all sorts of Merchandises, which they barter onely for Gold. But the Inhabitants of the City <HI>Sillico</HI> buy Salt of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> for <HI>Blacks.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Marabouts,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Faith, Religion, and Worship.</NOTE> or Priests, which for the most part reside in <HI>Silligo,</HI> dispence with the seriousness of their Profession to Trade for Gold, not onely to <HI>Borsalo,</HI> but higher up the River; yet as a cloak to their covetous∣ness, they live retired, and separate themselves from the rest of the People: It's true, they have a kind of dark Notions concerning the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> and can darkly Discourse of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> of the Deluge, of <HI>Moses,</HI> and many other like things, yet are in all things absolute <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> They own God, whom they call <HI>Alla,</HI> and according to the <HI>Alcaron,</HI> admit neither Idols nor Images; they use Circumcision and their <HI>Friday</HI> Sabbaths, but not so strictly as to for∣bear
<PB N="359" REF="228"/>their ordinary business and employments. Besides themselves none can, or may learn to Write or Read, and that ignorance nuzzles them up even to the neglect of all acts of Devotion whatsoever.</P>
<P>These <HI>Santons,</HI> as other <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> make mention sometimes of <HI>Christ,</HI> whom they call <HI>Nabe,</HI> and say he was a great Prophet, who wrought many Miracles, and had a Mother named <HI>Mary;</HI> but particularly deny him to be the Son of God, objecting that God is invisible, incomprehensible, and a Spirit, which cannot Beget, neither needs a Son to be with him.</P>
<P>When any of them die, he is buried with all his Gold; and he is reputed the happiest who is buried with the greatest quantity: so that notwith∣standing all their pretensions to zeal both living and dying, Gold is their onely Deity.</P>

<P>The next place call'd by the <HI>Portuguese, Cabo Roxo,</HI> lying in twelve Degrees and fifteen Minutes North Latitude; which by the falling a way off the Coast, a small Wood shews it self very remarkable to Mariners at Sea: Five miles from <HI>Cabo Roxo</HI> to the South-East, is a place by Seamen call'd, <HI>The Great Rough Bay;</HI> adjacent to which stands the Town <HI>Besu;</HI> and two miles and a half farther, the small rough Point.</P>
<P>Next in order follows <HI>Sante Domingo</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> otherwise <HI>Jarem,</HI> which seems to be a Branch of the <HI>Niger.</HI> There are divers other Points and Banks in the Sea-Coast between <HI>Cabo Roxo</HI> and this River; as <HI>The Red Point, The North Bank, The South Bank,</HI> or <HI>Sea-gull, The Point of Easter Even,</HI> and <HI>The Black Point.</HI></P>
<P>In the Latitude of eleven Degrees and eight Minutes North Latitude, flows the River <HI>Katcheo,</HI> a Branch of <HI>Sante Domingo,</HI> two miles East from the <HI>Rough Point;</HI> at the entrance of it lies some dry Sand, although the whole Current glides through a muddy ground to the Village <HI>Cassio.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Katcheo</HI> it meets with another Branch, call'd <HI>Sargedogon,</HI> Eastward of <HI>Gambea,</HI> but runs to <HI>Katcheo.</HI> The <HI>Blacks</HI> of <HI>Katcheo,</HI> when any Ships come out of <HI>Europe</HI> thither, come with their <HI>Canoos</HI> to Traffique.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Domingo,</HI> the River of the three Islands, call'd in <HI>Spanish, Rio de las Iletas,</HI> taketh its course through the Countrey of the <HI>Papais,</HI> which <HI>Jarrik</HI> names <HI>Buramos;</HI> To the South of which, opposite to <HI>Guinala</HI> and <HI>Besegui,</HI> lie seventeen other Islands, entituled, <HI>The Bigiohos,</HI> or <HI>Bisegos.</HI></P>
<P>Next the <HI>Buramos,</HI> or <HI>Papais,</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Guinala</HI> and <HI>Biguba,</HI> are embra∣ced between two Arms of <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> the one call'd <HI>Guinala,</HI> and the other <HI>Bigu∣ba,</HI> from the Countreys they conterminate, being in eleven Degrees North La∣titude, about four and forty miles from <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> between the Islands of <HI>Jagos,</HI> or <HI>Byagos.</HI></P>
<P>More Southerly appears the River <HI>Danalvy,</HI> passing through the Countreys of the <HI>Malucen,</HI> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Kokolis;</HI> then you come to <HI>Nunno Tris∣tan,</HI> and a mile and a half farther to <HI>Tabito,</HI> or <HI>Vegas,</HI> which loses both Name and Current in the Sea, near the Territory of the same Name.</P>
<P>Having left <HI>Vegas,</HI> you arrive in the Countrey of <HI>Cape,</HI> watered by the two great Rivers <HI>Kaluz</HI> and <HI>Karceres.</HI></P>
<P>More to the In-land, on the River <HI>Gambea,</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Mandinga</HI> and <HI>Beni</HI> are seated.</P>
<PB N="362" REF="230"/>
<P>A little farther to the South lieth the River <HI>Marine;</HI> and on the Sea-Coast the Mountain and Kingdom of <HI>Serre-Lions.</HI></P>
<P>Between the <HI>Bisegos</HI> and <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> in the River <HI>Sorres,</HI> lie the Islands of <HI>Tamara,</HI> or <HI>Veu Usvitay,</HI> commonly call'd by the <HI>Portuguese, De los Idolos;</HI> and Southward of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> the <HI>Bannannes</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>Thus much as to the general Description; we will now proceed to each particular, and therein for method sake, begin with the Kingdom of <HI>Kassa∣manse.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE KINGDOM OF KASANGAS, OR KASSAMANSE.</HEAD>
<P>THis Kingdom lies encompassed as it were by the River <HI>De Rha,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kingdom of <HI>Kassa∣manse.</HI></NOTE> on all sides but the East, where the <HI>Benhuers</HI> give it Limits. It is a large Tract of Ground, and by the moistening of the afore-mentioned Rivers very fertile, so that it produces not onely great store and variety of Fruit, but also pleasant Vales and luxuriant Meadows for the Pasturing of Cattel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> have in this place by the River side a Fort call'd <HI>St. Philips,</HI> of a convenient strength, well Mann'd, and Planted with several Pieces of Ordnance, to withstand any sudden and treacherous On-slaught of the Na∣tives.</P>

<P>¶ THe <HI>Kassamansines</HI> are down-right <HI>Pagans,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Religion.</NOTE> devoted to one Idol, among others, named <HI>China,</HI> signifying <HI>God,</HI> in whose honour, on the Twen∣ty ninth of <HI>September</HI> at midnight, they solemnize a high Festival: at which time some of their Priests, or Soothsayers, which they call <HI>Arakam,</HI> (as indeed they are all no better than Magicians and Witches) wears a blue Scarf, wherein
<PB N="363" REF="230"/>they depict a bundle of Rice Branches, intermixed with Bones, in remem∣brance, perhaps, of such as have out of the height of their blind zeal sacrificed themselves to this Idol; under whose form the Devil beguiles them in several manners. This Priest begins a circular Procession, which finished, they place it in a hollow Tree, offering before it many Burnt-sacrifices, and other Ob∣lations of Honey, and the like: At length ending their Devotions, in stead of Prayers, with several extravagant and inarticulate Ejaculations, they betake themselves to their particular Abodes.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Portugals</HI> here (as in <HI>Zenega</HI>) come with Ships laden with all sorts of <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Wares,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Trade.</NOTE> which they barter with their Countreymen re∣sident here to great profit for <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves, which they transport to <HI>Carthage∣na</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and there sell dearer by ten Rials a piece, than any either of <HI>Benin</HI> or <HI>Angola;</HI> and not without cause, for these are cleaner limb'd, bet∣ter shap'd and featur'd, of a notable capacity and understanding, but withall stubborn and suspicious: but time and experience must discover those quali∣ties, while in the interim their outward Semblance advances the Market: nor are the numbers of them small, as will easily appear, if we consider that the best Commodities brought hither, are for the most part exchang'd for such; being either purchas'd by War, or else under the pretext of some imperious and arbitrary Laws by the Kings and Great Men of the Countrey, first en∣slav'd, and then sold. The like Trade is driven at <HI>St. Jago,</HI> one of the Salt Islands, <HI>Cape Verde, Refrisko, Porto de Ale,</HI> and <HI>Ivala.</HI></P>
<P>The Wares chiefly desir'd, and bought up almost at any rate by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> are <HI>Spanish</HI> and Brandy-Wines, Oyl, Fruits, Iron, Stuffs for Clothes, fine Lin∣nen Edgings, Bracelets, Damask, Laces, Nails, Yarn, Silk, and other small Wares; but among all these Iron is the chief.</P>

<P>The chiefest place of this Countrey, is the Haven of <HI>Guinala;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Haven of <HI>Guinala.</HI></NOTE> and the next the Cross Haven, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> possess.</P>
<P>The Countrey by means of the clear and serene Air, is very healthful and pleasant to live in.</P>
<P>The King always appears in great State, and when he goeth abroad,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's State.</NOTE> is at∣tended with a strong and numerous Guard of Bowe-men.</P>
<P>He keeps also fifty great and fierce Dogs, which he arms, as it were, in tann'd Skins of Sea-Cows, that are so hard and strong, they can scarcely be cut; each Dog in the day time hath a Keeper, but in the night they are let loose; for there is no other Watch in this City but these Dogs; and such is their fierceness, no body dares stir in the Streets without the hazard of his life; for they will fall upon every one without regard. This Dog-Watch was at first set up against the Thieves, who in the nights used to break open the Houses, and steal the <HI>Blacks</HI> to sell for Slaves. This King gives a Hat to his Gover∣nors, which is an Ensign of Honour; of whom he has under him seven, which are not onely his Homagers, but his Slaves.</P>
<P>When the King dies, there comes into the Street twelve Men call'd <HI>Schiten,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When the King's Death is proclaimed, and by whom.</NOTE> cloathed in parti-coloured long Coats made of Feathers, with as many <HI>Claro∣men,</HI> or Pipers before them, which sound mournfully, yet shrill; there they proclaim his Decease: whereupon every one with a white Cloth thrown over them comes out of their Houses, and do nothing all that day, but walk about the Streets in a mournful posture; his Friends, Relations, and Servants in the mean time assemble to chuse a Successor.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funeral.</NOTE> Afterwards the Corps is washed, and the Intrals burnt before their Idol, but the Ashes preserved to be Interr'd with the Body; which lies as it were in State for a Moneth: at the ex∣piration whereof, prepared for Burial, the Subjects bring out of all parts of the Kingdom, Balsom, Myrrhe, Ambergreece, Musk, and other Perfumes, to burn and smoke about the Corps, which lastly is carried to the Burying-place by six of the most eminent persons, cloathed in white Silk Coats, followed in the first place with Musick playing mournful Tunes, and after them with a
<PB N="366" REF="232"/>great many people on foot; some of which cry aloud, other sing Funeral Ele∣gies: last of all the Princes of the Blood ride on Horseback in white Habit. By the Grave are his Women and Servants which in his Lifetime he most affected, together with his Favourites and Horses, which are all put to death and buried with the Royal Corps; which is done to this end, that he may be served by them in the other World, as they believe and are taught. This slaughter is performed in a terrible manner, <HI>viz.</HI> after the cutting off their Fingers and Toes, they break their Bones by stamping all to pieces, and when it is beat enough, they throw it out in the presence of all the others that are to undergo the same fortune: for the avoiding which cruelty, many Servants, af∣ter they have sufficiently provided for themselves, either leave the King's Ser∣vice in his Life, and fly away, or else they retire and hide themselves in time, when they see he is without hope of recovery.</P>

<P>¶ THis Kingdom containeth above thirty Rivers, which all empty them∣selves into the <HI>Great Ocean;</HI> and most of them having broad streams, neighbored with pleasant Valleys, and flowing between Groves of Orange-Trees, and their Banks on both sides edg'd with fair Towns and Villages, to the great delight of Passengers.</P>
<P>The first River by <HI>Cape de Virgen</HI> is by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Rio das Piedras,</HI> that is, <HI>The Stone-River,</HI> because of the many Stones therein. It is a very great River, and divides the Countrey with several Arms, making many Islands, stiled <HI>Cagasian,</HI> or <HI>Cagakais,</HI> where the <HI>Portugals</HI> have built a strong Fort for the conveniency of their Trade.</P>
<P>In the next place the Maps of the Countrey have set <HI>Rio Pichel, Rio Palmas, Rio Pogone, Rio de Cangranca, Rio Casses, Rio Carocane, Capar,</HI> and <HI>Tambasine;</HI> which two last take their original from the Mountains of <HI>Machamala;</HI> upon which may be seen a stately Work of Chrystal, with several Pyramids of the same Matter.</P>
<P>Lastly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Mitombo.</HI></NOTE> they describe the River <HI>Tagarin,</HI> otherwise <HI>Mitombo,</HI> but at present by the <HI>English, Portugals, Dutch,</HI> and other-Traders, call'd <HI>Rio. de Serre-Lions.</HI> This River taking its course Northward of the Point of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> is at the Mouth twelve miles broad, but on the North-side half way choaked up with divers Shelves of Sand, which divide it into three Channels; one runs along the North-side, the other in the midst; but the great Channel Coasts by the South, which is the deepest of all. The <HI>Portugals</HI> pass onely in the two small Chan∣nels with Boats; for in the third, or great Channel they dare not venture. Al∣so between the Island <HI>Tasso,</HI> lying in this River and the South, there be many small Currents, passable with little Vessels, but not with great Ships.</P>
<P>Another call'd <HI>Bangue,</HI> glides on the South-side of <HI>Serre-Lions</HI> into the Sea, as <HI>Mitombo</HI> on the North-side; so that the Mountain by these two Rivers lieth inclosed in manner of a hanging Island, and maketh the prominent Point, call'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Serre-Lions.</HI></NOTE> as we have often said, <HI>Cabo de Serre-Lions,</HI> but so narrow, that the <HI>Blacks</HI> take their <HI>Canoos</HI> upon their Shoulders, and carry them over.</P>
<P>On both Shores of this River lie several Towns and Countreys: those to the North-side are call'd <HI>Bolm,</HI> which signifies <HI>Low;</HI> but they on the South, are in their Language named <HI>Timna.</HI></P>
<P>On the outermost Point to the Mouth stands the Town <HI>Serboracasa,</HI> and on another Point, lying on a yellow sandy Bay, a mile and a half distant, they have the first place where the Ships, which frequent this Coast, take in fresh Waters.</P>
<PB N="371" REF="234"/>
<P>The Countrey about <HI>Serboracasa</HI> is call'd <HI>Serbore,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serbora.</NOTE> extending from the Sea to the Town <HI>Bagos.</HI> A mile Eastward of <HI>Serbore</HI> beginneth another Dominion,

<P>Eight or ten Paces within the Shore is the second Watering-place,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Watering∣place.</NOTE> where the Water drills easily down the side of a little rising Ground: About two miles farther lies a flat Shore full of Trees, and between them a small open place, through which a Brook descends from above, which at low Water runs away over the Beach.</P>
<P>A Musquet-shot distance thence into the Land, stands a Town, where <HI>Don Andreas</HI> (Brother of the King of <HI>Bolm-berre</HI>) resides; here the River hath a strong Current, which two miles and a half upwards splits it self in∣to three Branches; one to the North-East, having red Sand, hath Water enough to bear great Ships; but the middlemost, by reason of the shallow∣ness, Shelfs of Sand, and Cliffs, may onely be passed with Skiffs and small Boats.

<HEAD>The Islands De los Idolos, Bravas, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ALong the Coast of <HI>Serre-Lions</HI> lie several Islands; particularly twelve miles and a half Southward of the <HI>Cape de Virgen,</HI> those of <HI>Tamara</HI> and <HI>Veu Usvitay,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Los Idolos,</HI> which West and by South from the Point appear as joyn'd to the Continent; but afterwards shew themselves as they are in truth, Islands, which afford all sorts of fresh Provisions to the Seamen, and good Tobacco.</P>
<P>The people are self-will'd and mistrustful, and will not suffer any <HI>Dutchmen</HI> to come into their Towns.</P>
<P>The most advantageous Commodities vented there, are Salt and Brandy; to for which they have in Exchange Elephants-Teeth and Gold.</P>
<P>To the South end of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> near the Islands <HI>Banannes,</HI> appears to Ships sailing by, a very high Mountain raising his Head into the Clouds, call'd <HI>Ma∣chamala;</HI> whereof we shall have occasion to speak more largely in a short space.</P>
<P>Near the South-end of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> half a mile in the Sea, lie the Islands <HI>Bravas,</HI> being a high Land full of Trees, the biggest having a Spring of fresh Water.</P>
<P>Five miles from hence lie on the South-East, against the Point, three other little Islets call'd <HI>Sombreras.</HI></P>
<P>Between the <HI>Sombreras</HI> and <HI>Bravas</HI> is the place where <HI>Jacob le Maire,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred and fifteen, found four Rivers; among which the We∣stermost,
<PB N="372" REF="235"/>having large Banks, had depth and breadth enough for great Ships. The next running in between the Trees, they might stand on either side of the shore, and not be able to see Land on the other: thereabouts it was wild and waste, without any signs of inhabiting; but they saw many wild Beasts, as Ele∣phants, Buffles, Boars, Civet-Cats, and such like. The third had a Bank that hin∣der'd the coming in of Ships. Three or four miles upward lay a low Land full of Lemon-Trees, whose Fruits, notwithstanding it was in the time of the Rain, hung most of them ripe upon the Trees. The fourth was a small River with∣in the Point of the Island <HI>Sombreras,</HI> whose Water is deep and Salt; where the Sea-men, coming on Shore, found Crocodiles, Turtles, and Oisters on the Trees.</P>
<P>The afore-mention'd Bay here and there hath Shole-water,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Furna de Sante Anna.</NOTE> about five, six, seven, or eight Fathom, and muddy Ground, which runs between the <HI>Sombreras-Islands</HI> Easterly, and <HI>Furna de Sante Anna,</HI> whence come many Rivers; amongst which the chiefest is <HI>Gambea.</HI></P>
<P>Twelve miles upward of <HI>Gambea,</HI> being as far as it is Navigable with small Vessels, lies a Place call'd <HI>Kancho,</HI> in the height of seven Degrees, being very low Land; whereto adjoyn some Islands.</P>
<P>¶ THis Countrey of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> according to the Description of <HI>Jarrick,</HI> many take for the healthfullest place of all <HI>Guinee,</HI> and the Air much wholsomer than that of <HI>Portugal,</HI> so that seldom any die by other infirmity than that of Old Age. The same Air, as <HI>Jarrick</HI> adds, is much better for a mans health than in many places of <HI>Europe,</HI> being neither too cold, nor too hot, by reason of the cool Winds which blow there continually; which is worth observation, considering the nearness of its scituation to the Equinoctial: And truly, under the favor of that Author, we may question his Assertion, see∣ing in the Summer, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> it is there dark, and close rainy Wea∣ther, with South, and South-West Winds; as also because the Rain-water in all the neighboring parts of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> and along the Sea-Coast, is of so unwhol∣som a quality, that where-ever it falls on the bare Body, it causes Swellings and Blotches on the Skin, and breeds a sort of strange Worms in the Cloathes; besides, the River-water in <HI>April</HI> is very offensive, and dangerous to drink, by reason the Ground, through the Summer excessive heats, and the stench of poi∣sonous Beasts, which dy'd through the extraordinary burning of the Sun, and rotting on the Earth, seems to leave some of their venom on the superficies of the ground, which is wash'd off by the Rain, and carried into the Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Netherland East. India</HI> Ships put sometimes in here, to refresh themselves, and to take in fresh Water, but to the great prejudice of the Sea-men, if it hap∣pen at the beginning of the Rain, and while the afore-mention'd poison is in the Water: moreover their greedy eating of raw Fruit, there found in great plenty, brings upon them many dangerous and mortal Sicknes∣ses.</P>
<P>The Countrey is by some reputed very fruitful,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fruitfulness of the Countrey.</NOTE> for it yields abundance of white <HI>Mille,</HI> Rice, and two or three sorts of <HI>Cardamoms,</HI> or <HI>Grains of Paradice.</HI> About the River of <HI>Serre-Lions</HI> it yields several sorts of Fruits, especially Le∣mons, a great refreshing to Seamen; many wild Vines, bearing good Grapes, a few Oranges, and some <HI>Indian</HI> Figs, by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Banamas.</HI></P>
<P>The Islands of <HI>Sombreras</HI> produce many Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, Palmito-Trees of several sorts, which afford the Inhabitants Wine, Palm-Oyl, and
<PB N="373" REF="235"/>other things; but above all, an excellent sort of Sope, made of the Oyl and Ashes of the <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees, so much exceeding the <HI>European</HI> Sope, that it is prohibited to be brought into <HI>Portugal,</HI> because it should not bring down the Price of their own.</P>
<P>Here, and in the neighboring Islands, grow many Sugar-Canes naturally; whence might be raised great Profit from the conveniency of the many adja∣cent Rivers, where Mills might be set up to Grind them, without the charge of Slaves.</P>
<P>They have also great store of Cotton, red-coloured Wood, vulgarly call'd <HI>Brasil,</HI> better than that which comes from <HI>Brasile,</HI> for it will give a tincture in Dying seven several times: Besides, there is a sort of Wood named <HI>Angelin,</HI> fit to build Ships with; and the Barque affords Materials to Caulk the Seams of Vessels, and make Match for Guns.</P>
<P>The other Commodities are Wax, Ivory, and Long-Pepper, by the <HI>Portu∣gals</HI> call'd <HI>Pimenta del Kola,</HI> and Tail-Pepper, or <HI>Pimenta del Rab.</HI> Both these sorts are taken to be much better than the <HI>East-India</HI> Pepper; but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath prohibited the Importing it into his Countrey, that the Trade of <HI>East-India</HI> Pepper may not be spoiled, which brings them such great Profit: However, the <HI>English, Hollanders, French,</HI> and other People that Trade in this Countrey, bring it over, but the <HI>Portugals</HI> barter it on the Coast of <HI>Guinee,</HI> in exchange for Gold, Slaves, Provision, and other things, according as the Pla∣ces wherein they Trade differ or vary.</P>
<P>In Mount <HI>Makamala</HI> (which we mention'd before) appears,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrystal Rocks.</NOTE> from the Skirts of whose over-shooting Edges, which hang like Bases or Penthouses, several Christalline <HI>Radii</HI> shoot in a Pyramidal Form, with the Points pendent towards the ground within four or five foot, like Isicles from the Eaves of a house, which when struck, yield a pleasant twang like the strings of an In∣strument, both to the delight and admiration of the beholders.</P>
<P>Among other Beasts found in this place, there are three sorts of Monkeys;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aper.</NOTE> one call'd <HI>Baris;</HI> they are strong and active, and withall so sensible, that be∣ing taken up young and tutor'd, they are serviceable on many occasions; for they go commonly on their hinder-feet, and beat <HI>Mille</HI> in a Mortar, fetch Water out of the River in small Cans on their heads, which if they chance to let fall, they squeak and cry out as afraid; they also turn the Spits, and do several Jugling-tricks, to the great pleasure and pastime of their Masters.</P>
<P>In the Village of <HI>Serborakasa</HI> the Ships are furnish'd with all sorts of Pro∣visions; for the Land yields abundance of Cattel and Fowl. The Rivers have infinite variety of good Fish, and also the Sea-Coast, than which <HI>Europe</HI> can boast none better.</P>
<P>¶ THe People of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> and the <HI>Cape of Sagre</HI> or <HI>Tagrin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Custom and Habit of the Inhabitants.</NOTE> are rather brown than black; they mark their Bodies in several places with hot Irons, and in their Faces, Ears, and Noses having many holes, wherein they place several Jewels, which they call <HI>Mazubas,</HI> and Gold Rings: They go always naked, onely upon their <HI>Pudenda</HI> they wear a Flap made of the Barks of Trees.</P>
<P>Two sorts of <HI>Negroes</HI> inhabit about <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> that is, <HI>Capez,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants are two sorts. <HI>Capez.</HI></NOTE> a People of more clear spirit and judgement than those of <HI>Guinee;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jaric. lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> for they easily learn what is taught them; but withall are effeminate and luxurious: yet of late are much improv'd in Valour and Manhood, by the continual Wars they are
<PB N="374" REF="236"/>forc'd to wage with the <HI>Kumba's</HI> their Neighbors. The other are these <HI>Kum∣ba's,</HI> call'd also <HI>Manes,</HI> being <HI>Anthropophagi,</HI> and by consequence of nature cruel and barbarous. These in the Year Fifteen hundred and fifteen invaded the <HI>Capez</HI> for Pillage; but inticed by the great Fertility of the place, determin'd to remain there, and dispossess the other: whereupon they furiously perse∣cuted the <HI>Capez,</HI> eating up whomsoever they took of them; till at length (as if satiated with humane bloud) they sold some to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> for Slaves: This their savage Tyranny so consternated the rest, that to escape that Barba∣rity, they almost totally deserted the Countrey; but since by the Converse with Merchants, and something softened with the pleasure of the Countrey, they have left those abominable Customs, and are become treatable, eating Rice, <HI>Mille,</HI> Beans, Oxen, and Goats flesh.</P>
<P>In every City or Village stands a great House sever'd from the other, where the young Maids have their aboad; and for the space of a year are instruct∣ed by a very honourable and well accomplish'd old man, sprung from a no∣ble Stock. At the end of the year they go forth all together, drest up accord∣ing to the best mode of the Countrey, to a place, where having Musick, they dance in the sight of their Parents, and many young men, who from among them chuse one they best like to marry; but before they are permitted to car∣ry their Brides away, they purchase them of their Fathers, and also give a sa∣tisfactory recompence to their old and grave Instructor.</P>
<P>Their Kings are buried without the Towns in a large place erected of pur∣pose,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funerals of the dead.</NOTE> and cover'd over with Straw; alleadging, it is not fit that such should be buried in the open air, who have in their life time born the publick Office of a Judge. Others are buried in their Houses, attired with Gold Bracelets, Pendants in the Ears, and Nose-Jewels. Their Lamentations and Mourn∣ing are perform'd in open places, according to the Rank and Quality of the Deceased.</P>
<P>The Wealth of the Inhabitants consists in Ambergreece,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches.</NOTE> Chrystal, Pearles, Ivory, Wax, excellent Brasil-Wood, long Pepper, and unrefin'd Gold.</P>
<P>The Wares which the Merchants receive chiefly in Exchange of their <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> Commodities, are Elephants-Teeth, Gold, and Red-Wood, which last is generally bought up by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The Countreys on the North-side of <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> have a peculiar Language, call'd <HI>The Bolmish Tongue,</HI> being hard to learn, and difficult to pronounce; whereas that of the people of <HI>Timna,</HI> dwelling to the South, is easie.</P>
<P>The <HI>Capez</HI> and <HI>Kumba's</HI> are subject to their particular Princes, who sit in publick to administer Justice, and decide their Differences; and to that end have near their Palaces several terrassed Walks, call'd <HI>Funko's,</HI> in every of which is rais'd a Throne cover'd over with fine Mats, where the King sits; and on each side plac'd long Forms for the Noblemen, call'd <HI>Solatequies,</HI> that is, Councellors, with whose advice he determines the Causes.</P>
<P>The Method this; first appears the Party Complainant, with his Proctors and Advocates, call'd by them <HI>Troens,</HI> attir'd with several sorts of Feathers, having Bells at their heels, and Staves in their hands to lean on; when they Plead, they put a Mask before their Faces, that they may not be afraid, but speak freely before the King what they have to say: after the Cause is plead∣ed on both sides, and the Councellors have given their opinion upon it, the King pronounces the definitive Sentence, with present Execution against the party cast.</P>
<PB N="375" REF="236"/>
<P>When the King Creates one of these Councellers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the King's Lords of his Council are made.</NOTE> he causes him to come into the <HI>Funko;</HI> where being set upon a wooden Stool curiously wrought and carv'd, and appointed onely for this Solemnity, he girts him with a bloudy Fillet of a Goats-skin about the Temples; afterwards Rice-meal is strowed over it, and presently a red Cap put upon his Head: And that the people may take notice of this new-conferr'd Honour, he is carried about in Tri∣umph upon the shoulders of certain Officers to that purpose appointed. These Ceremonies perform'd, the new-made Lord makes an Entertainment, wherein they spend three days in all kind of Mirth and divertising Pastimes, setting forth divers Skirmishes, and other jocose Exercises, according to the fashion of the Countrey: At last they kill an Oxe, and divide the flesh a∣mong the common people.</P>

<HEAD>THE KINGDOM OR COUNTREY OF QUOIA.</HEAD>
<P>THis Kingdom scituate by <HI>Cape de Monte,</HI> containeth especially two Countreys, <HI>viz. Vey-berkoma,</HI> and <HI>Quoia-Berkoma.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vey-berkoma,</HI> that is, the Countrey of <HI>Vey,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vey-Berkoma.</NOTE> the Antient Name of the Inhabitants, is that Tract which lieth at <HI>Cape de Monte,</HI> near the River <HI>Mavah;</HI> below which lieth <HI>Dauwala,</HI> wherein the same River Northward of the <HI>Cape,</HI> hath its <HI>Exit</HI> into the Sea.</P>
<P>The Antient Inhabitants (as we said) <HI>Vey,</HI> are by Wars reduc'd to a small number, possessing onely a parcel of ruin'd Villages or Towns; insomuch, that their Name is almost forgotten.</P>
<P>Another People, nam'd <HI>Puy-monou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puy-Monou.</NOTE> dwelt antiently before the Wars and Conquest of the Countrey by the <HI>Karou's</HI> in the Island <HI>Boebelech,</HI> and along the Banks of the River <HI>Mavah.</HI> But few of this Posterity are at present to be found; being for the most part by Inter-marriages with the <HI>Karou's</HI> so united, as if but one in Name and Nature.</P>
<P><HI>Quoia-Berkoma</HI> begins at the Sea-Coast of the <HI>New-River,</HI> or <HI>Rio Novo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quoia-Berkoma.</NOTE> by the Inhabitants stil'd <HI>Magwibba,</HI> and extends to <HI>Rio Paulo,</HI> a Boundary between this and the Territory of <HI>Gebbe,</HI> shooting out into the Land above twenty miles.</P>
<P>This Kingdom boasts great numbers of Towns and Villages, most of them pleasantly seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Magwibba.</HI></P>
<PB N="380" REF="241"/>
<P>The first appearing in five Degrees and three and forty Minutes-North La∣titude,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape de Monte.</NOTE> by the Inhabitants is call'd <HI>Wachkongo;</HI> and by the <HI>Portugals, Cabo Monte;</HI> although the Countrey both on the West and East is low and over-grown with Bushes.</P>
<P>This Point to Ships sayling out of the West shews its self in the shape of a Helm; but coming near, it appears long with a gap in the middle. Westward of this is the Road where the Ships Ride, that put in to trade upon this Coast.</P>
<P>Half a mile upwards from <HI>Magwibba</HI> on the left side,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jegwonga.</NOTE> stands a Village call'd <HI>Jegwonga,</HI> where the King <HI>Flamboere</HI> settled his Royal Mansion, when he first left <HI>Tomvy;</HI> but at present he resides on the Island <HI>Massagh,</HI> in the Lake <HI>Plizoge,</HI> whither he retired to avoid the hazards of the people of <HI>Dogo,</HI> that invaded his Territories.</P>
<P>On the other side of the River stands the fair Town <HI>Fachoo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fachoo.</NOTE> signifying, <HI>I watch the Dead;</HI> which <HI>Flamboere</HI> fortifi'd, and retir'd to as a place of security, upon intelligence that the Land of <HI>Folgia</HI> would make War upon him, though afterwards he found it but a rumor.</P>
<P>A mile and half farther up,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figgia.</NOTE> on the same side, <HI>Figgia</HI> discovers its self, being formerly the Dwelling of <HI>Figgi,</HI> one of King <HI>Flamboere</HI>'s Brothers.</P>
<P>A mile beyond that,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cammagoereia.</NOTE> on the same Shore, is seated <HI>Cammagoereia;</HI> and half a mile from thence, the handsome Town <HI>Jerboeffaia,</HI> where the Prince of <HI>Quoia,</HI> who commands the Countrey round about, keeps his Court; opposite to this last, King <HI>Flamboere</HI> about a year since began to lay the Foundations of a new Town.</P>
<P>From thence going, along the Sea-Shore lie dispersed some Salt-Towns, where the Inhabitants boyl Salt out of Sea-Water.</P>
<P>In the Vales of <HI>Tomvy,</HI> water'd by the River <HI>Plizoge,</HI> stands a great Town or Village, beset with Trees sprung up out of the Rubbish of its decayed Walls: From thence to <HI>Cape de Monte</HI> lye some forsaken and wasted Villages: On a Branch of the River <HI>Menoch</HI> or <HI>Aguado,</HI> is scituate <HI>Faly-hammaia,</HI> and two miles farther, another call'd <HI>Flomy-Seggaya.</HI></P>
<P>The Region of <HI>Quoia</HI> hath the benefit of four excellent Rivers;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Countrey of <HI>Quoia</HI> is watered by four Rivers.</NOTE> the first in the West, <HI>Magwibba,</HI> or <HI>Rio Novo;</HI> the second, <HI>Mavah;</HI> the third, <HI>Plizoge;</HI> the fourth, <HI>Menoch,</HI> or <HI>Aguado.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Magwibba</HI> in Summer bears two miles and a half in breadth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Magwibba.</HI></NOTE> but in Winter is broader and fuller of Water: It runs from the Sea up into the Land, taking a North-Easterly Course up into the Countrey; in the Mouth of it are so many Banks or Shelves, as great Bars, that make it dange∣rous to be passed with small Boats, although the <HI>English, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> have, and still venture over it in their little Skiffs.</P>
<P>As far as <HI>Davarouia,</HI> it may conveniently be passed with reasonable Vessels, being very deep, and four hundred foot wide; but above that place, by the interposition of divers Rocks, which cause great Water-falls, there is no passing.</P>
<P>The second call'd <HI>Mavah,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Mavah.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Maffah,</HI> on whose Shore formerly the <HI>Puy-mo∣nou</HI> dwelt, springs from a Mountain four and twenty miles within the Coun∣trey. The Channel is wide and deep, making its <HI>Exit</HI> into the Sea in the broken Land of <HI>Dauwala,</HI> almost a mile Northward of <HI>Wach-kongo,</HI> or <HI>Cape de Monte.</HI></P>
<PB N="381" REF="241"/>
<P>Between these two Rivers along the Sea-Coast, here and there, they say, stand certain Towns, where the Inhabitants make Salt.</P>
<P>The third, <HI>Plizoge,</HI> meets with the Sea a mile Northward of <HI>Cabo de Monte.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Plizoge.</HI></NOTE> This is sometime in dry weather very empty of Water, but so continues not long, being soon fully replenisht.</P>
<P>Three miles from this River appears a great Lake, a mile and a half broad, wherein stands the Island <HI>Massagh,</HI> the Courtly Residence of the present King <HI>Flamboere:</HI> on whose South-side flourish many stately <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees.</P>
<P>The fourth, <HI>Menoch,</HI> or <HI>Rio Aq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ado,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Menoch.</HI></NOTE> cometh out of the Countrey above the <HI>Hondous,</HI> and six or seven miles Eastward of <HI>Cape de Monte</HI> poures into the Sea. It is a deep and wide River, yet unpassable, because of several Water-falls, Cliffs, and Shelves of Sand that choak it. It hath on both sides Red-wood Trees.</P>
<P>Having thus given you the Scituations of Towns and Rivers in this King∣dom, we will now proceed to describe the Vegetables or Plants, Beasts, and then the Customs or Manners of the People: but by the way, in regard <HI>Gala-Vy, Hondo, Konde Quoias, Manou,</HI> and <HI>Folgia,</HI> lying round about, participate of the same qualities with <HI>Karou,</HI> already mention'd, or at least with very small difference, we will give you a cursory glimpse of these in particular, and then carry on our intended method.</P>
<P><HI>Gala-vy,</HI> a member of <HI>Quoia,</HI> shews the original source of <HI>Mavah,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gala-vy.</NOTE> near a great Wood of eight or ten days Journey in length. It bears the Names of <HI>Gala-vy</HI> from its Inhabitants, sprung at first from <HI>Galas,</HI> but being driven out of their Countrey by the People of <HI>Hondo,</HI> sought new Habitations in those places; whence they were neither call'd <HI>Vy,</HI> as those with whom they intermixt, nor <HI>Galas,</HI> their old Name, but <HI>Gala-Vy,</HI> that is, half <HI>Galas,</HI> and half <HI>Vy.</HI></P>
<P>On the Borders of <HI>Hondo</HI> and <HI>Manoe,</HI> beyond the fore-mention'd great Wood, dwell the right <HI>Galas,</HI> who are under the Jurisdiction of the Kingdom of <HI>Manoe,</HI> and have a Prince entituled <HI>Gallafally.</HI></P>
<P>The next is <HI>Hondo,</HI> inhabited by the <HI>Hondo-Monou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hondo.</NOTE> scituate by the side of this Wilderness, more North-Easterly then <HI>Gala-vy,</HI> and contains within it the pe∣culiar Lordship of <HI>Dogo.</HI></P>
<P>Neighboring to these dwell the <HI>Konde-Quoia's,</HI> or <HI>High-Quoia's,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Konde-Quoias.</NOTE> that differ in Speech from the Maritime <HI>Quoia's.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards you arrive at the Kingdom of <HI>Folgia</HI> and <HI>Manou,</HI> or <HI>Manoe;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Folgia</HI> and <HI>Manou.</HI></NOTE> which last is a Potent State, holding in subjection most of the Countrey round about; two small Rivers encompass it, <HI>viz. Rio Junk,</HI> and <HI>Arverado;</HI> the former <HI>Folgia</HI> East and by North above <HI>Rio Junk,</HI> the dividing limit between them, which with the other, in about five Degrees North Latitude, pour into the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Karou,</HI> whose Inhabitants took their Name from <HI>Karou-Monou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Countrey <HI>Karou</HI></NOTE> is a peculiar Territory, now included in <HI>Folgia</HI> by Conquest, but heretofore had a Prince of their own, and a Countrey large, and free from any slavish yoke.</P>
<P>At the Coast of <HI>Cape Saint Anne,</HI> and along to <HI>Cabo Monte,</HI> and <HI>Cabo das Palmas,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Winter-Season.</NOTE> the Rain begins with <HI>May</HI> and continues to <HI>October;</HI> during which time they have great and terrible Thunder and Lightning, with furious North-Westerly Gusts of Wind: however, this continual Showering so fills and pin∣guifies the before-cleft and parched Earth, as adapts it for the bearing of Rice, and other Fruits and Grains; for the whole face of the Ground is co∣vered with Water, that there can be no stirring for common converse, except in Boats.</P>
<PB N="382" REF="242"/>
<P>During this time also the Sea sets hard all along the Shore towards the North-East, so that Ships which between <HI>July</HI> and <HI>September</HI> happen to fall be∣low <HI>Cape de Monte,</HI> can very hardly, and not without great labour, get about to the South. Besides, this Race makes mountainous Billows roll to the Shore, so that it is in effect impossible to approach the same in Boats, without danger of splitting.</P>
<P>There blows also upon this Coast a Land and Sea-Wind; the first begins after midnight, and continues till high-Noon; the last rises after two, and holds till Midnight. But these Seasons once over, from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>May,</HI> the Weather proves pleasant and dry, till endammaged by the fiery heat of the scalding Air.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>QUoia Berkoma,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> with the adjacent Fields, are by the before-mention'd Rains so impregnated, that they produce all sorts of Grain and Plants in great abundance:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bonde.</NOTE> for first, there grows a great Tree call'd <HI>Bonde,</HI> in height exceeding all other Trees in the Wood, and scarce fathomable by six or seven Men, the Bark full of great Thorns, the Wood soft, of which they make <HI>Canoos,</HI> Stools, Spoons, and Dishes; the Roots lying generally four or five Foot above the Earth, they cut out into Planks and Boards for Doors to their Houses, and many other uses; with the Branches and young Sprouts Hedging the Towns, because being stuck into the Ground, they grow and make a Quickset-Fence: the refuse of the Wood they burn, and with the Ashes make a lixiviated Liquor, which boyled up with old Oyl of Palm, makes an excellent and very useful Sope.</P>
<P>The Tree <HI>Bassi</HI> grows high,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bassi.</NOTE> and two or three fathom thick, having a Russet-Bark, which they use in Dying to give a Russet-brown Tincture, as of the Trunk they make Boats, and such like Utensils.</P>
<P><HI>Kaey</HI> is also thick and high,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kaey.</NOTE> of whose hard Wood, being not apt to rot, they also make <HI>Canoos;</HI> but the Barks and Leaves, for their Medicinal Vertues, they use in Physick.</P>
<P><HI>Billegoh,</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mille.</NOTE> the Wood soft, the Root like the <HI>Bonde,</HI> grow∣ing above the Ground, the <HI>Blacks</HI> use it in charming Potions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Borrouw</HI> grows but to an ordinary height and bigness,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borrouw.</NOTE> but upon the Bark stick crooked Thorns like the Talons of a Fowl; these being chopt, yield a yellowish white Juyce, (the like do the thick Leaves beaten and pressed) which taken inwardly is an effectual Purge, and so certainly good, that 'tis commonly used when other Remedies will not work. The Wood is damp, and unfit either for Service or Fewel.</P>
<P><HI>Mammo</HI> a thick and high Tree, bears a Fruit white within, and of a tart taste,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mammo.</NOTE> much us'd in Physick; and buried under the earth, remains good a whole year.</P>
<P><HI>Quony,</HI> a high and thick Tree with a rough Bark, which they use in Philters or other charming Potions mixed with water; they make mortars of the wood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quony.</NOTE> because tough, and not easily split, wherein they stamp Rice. It bears a venomous Excrescence, full of Juyce, wherein the <HI>Blacks</HI> dip their Arrows, that from thence contract a mortal Poyson.</P>

<P><HI>Hoquella</HI> rises to a great heighth, bearing Shell-Fruit a foot and a half long,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoquella.</NOTE> inclosing flat Beans; the Bark and Leaves have a Physical Quality, and there∣fore in much use: But the Ashes of the Shells burnt, make a most useful Lye.</P>
<P><HI>Domboch</HI> bears Fruit pleasant and frequently eaten. The Bark bruised,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Domboch.</NOTE> and the Juice mixt in a convenient Vehicle makes an Excellent Purgative Medicine; but the wood they convert into Boats, Sugar-chests, and such like.</P>
<P><HI>Kolach</HI> a Tree of ordinary size, bears Fruit like Plumbs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kolach.</NOTE> very agreeable to the Palate, whose Bark also is of use in Physick.</P>
<P><HI>Bongia</HI> rising to a more than common size and bigness;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bongia.</NOTE> of no use but in the Bark, and that onely for Physick, and to give a yellow tincture in Dying.</P>
<P><HI>Duy</HI> in Growth like the former, produces round Apples,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duy.</NOTE> a profitable and wholesome Food both to man and beast: The Bark steeped in Wine and other Drinks, make them great Cordials.</P>
<P>The Bark of <HI>Niaukony</HI> tastes hot in the mouth like Pepper,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niaukony.</NOTE> and hath won the esteem of a more than common Remedy in many Diseases.</P>
<P>The <HI>Palmito-Trees</HI> grow here frequently, which young are call'd <HI>Quan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palmito-Tree.</NOTE> have many branches with long thorns, and small long Leaves, which hatchel'd, serves them in stead of Hemp, to make Nets and Ropes; grown up to the heighth of a man, it bears a kind of Nuts which are as big as Olives, of which the Palm-Oyl is made.</P>
<P>When it is shot up forty or fifty foot high, and proportionally large, the branches fall off, so that it stands naked like a Maste, onely with Branches and Leaves at the top, the undermost by degrees still falling off, while upwards new ones grow; thus full grown, it is call'd <HI>Tongoo;</HI> and when very old, af∣fords Wine, Oyl, and Hemp in one year. This Wine which the <HI>Blacks</HI> call <HI>Mignoll,</HI> they draw out by boaring a hole in the body of the Tree, where the Leaves at first began to sprout, out of which the Wine distills into a Pot or Pitcher hanging on a hook; in colour it resembles Whey, and at the first drawing is sweet and pleasant to the taste, like Wine; but the second day be∣gins to sower, and changes in short time into very good Vinegar. It intoxi∣cates the Brain, and makes those that drink too much thereof drunk, as other Drinks do: Out of one Tree two Gallons of this Liquor may be drawn in a day, without any damage to the Tree, or hinderance to the ripening of the Fruit; which are, as we said, a kind of Nuts, somewhat bigger than Olives, growing in a bunch; of which every Tree bears five or six, every one as much as a man can carry; every single Nut having within it in a hard stone a sweet Kernel.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Blacks</HI> gather this Fruit, they climb up with a Rope about their middle very readily and nimbly, and cut the Nuts from the bunch, whereof they make their Palm-Oyl in this manner; first they beat and stamp them, then boil it a first and second time; at the last boiling the Oyl swims at top, which they scum off with Spoons, and put into Pots or Pitchers: They use this Oyl as Butter or Oyl-Olive, which they have not, and anoint their Bodies therewith from head to foot, to make the Skin smooth and shining.</P>
<P><HI>Bang</HI> bears a great resemblance with the <HI>Palmito,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bang.</NOTE> and like it also yielding Wine, which they call <HI>Makensy;</HI> the Leaves are large, and half a fathom long, of which they make a sort of Tow, which they work into Mats, Nets, and all sorts of Ropes. The Branches being long and thick, and bushy,
<PB N="384" REF="243"/>like common Brushes or Beesoms, serve for many uses, <HI>viz.</HI> for covering for their Houses, Shelters, and Fences for their Villages, and such like.</P>
<P><HI>Dongah,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dongah.</NOTE> a great Tree, growing by the Sea-Coast, bearing Shell-fruit like great Wallnuts, and having round well tasted Kernels.</P>
<P>Red-wood Trees,

<P>The Tree <HI>Jaaia</HI> groweth abundantly in low and watry places,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jaaia.</NOTE> and on the Banks of Rivers, wherein, as if delighted in spreading his Boughs, the Oysters fix thereabouts, and grow.</P>
<P>There is another Tree,

<P>The whole Countrey abounds with Cotton-Trees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotton-Trees.</NOTE> which they name <HI>Fondy. Kong,</HI> from which they gather Cotton, to be woven into Cloth, and other things.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cillach.</NOTE> as big as Stags with us in <HI>Europe,</HI> having little Horns a span long, a Skin of the same colour, with a Tumour, or rather swelling Orifice on both sides, where the Wind co∣ming out, makes them unable or unfit, either for running or leaping.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buffles</HI> that breed here in great herds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buffles.</NOTE> do immense damage in the Rice-Fields.</P>
<P>Another Creature, call'd by the <HI>Blacks, Woey;</HI> and by the <HI>Portugals,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Woey.</NOTE> Gazellus de Mutte,</HI> being as big as an ordinary Dog, small bone'd, and swift in running, makes good sport to Men and Women that Hunt it, using many cunning shifts to avoid the Nets.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tebbe</HI> is a brown-coloured Beast, of the bigness of a Sheep,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tebbe. Culmo.</NOTE> and taken with Nets. So also the <HI>Culmo,</HI> but different in the redness of his Furre.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of wild Boars; one reddish-hair'd, call'd <HI>Kouja;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of Boars.</NOTE> the other black-hair'd, named <HI>Kouja quinta:</HI> The former like ours, but the later much bigger, and very mischievous, having monstrous Tusks, wherewith they cut and tear, as if it were split with a hatchet.</P>
<P>Porcupines also are of two sorts, a bigger, and a less;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of Porcu∣pines, or Hedghogs.</NOTE> the bigger by the Natives call'd <HI>Queenja,</HI> resembles a common Boar, but armed with sharp and long Quills, which it can dart out suddenly with so great force, that some∣times they kill Leopards with them: The less are about a foot high, but not dangerous, in regard they do not discharge their Quills.</P>
<P>They have also <HI>Dontfoes</HI> or Camelions, living (as they suppose) by the Air,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dontfoe.</NOTE> and in nothing harmful, onely they fancy it an ill Omen to see one, imagining one of their nearest friends shall die.</P>
<P>There is another strange Beast call'd <HI>Quoggelo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quoggelo.</NOTE> much resembling a Croco∣dile, six or seven foot long, very slender, but with a Tongue of extraordinary length: It is a Beast of Prey, and very strong, close set with gawdy Quills over the whole body, wherewith it onely offends men, and defends it self against other Creatures; for when the Leopard attempts to seize it, it converts into a round ball, setting up the points of his Quills, that no hold can be fixed. Their food is generally Pismires, which with their tongues they lick up at a great distance.</P>
<P>Both on the Sea-Coast and the up-land Countrey many Civet-Cats are found; of whose <HI>Genus</HI> there is great difference among Authors:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civet-Cat.</NOTE> Some will reduce them under the kind of Cats, according to their name; but <HI>Johnston</HI> ranks it with the <HI>Hyena;</HI> we will briefly describe it, and so leave the Reader to his own judgement: It more resembles a Wolf than a Cat; for it hath a long Head, with a small Nose, flat Mouth, and short Ears, their Teeth like those of a Dogs; the body part white, part ash-colour'd, speckled with black spots, the legs and feet of a middle size, with black hairs, having four Claws forward, and one backward, with black short flat nails; the Tail long, bushy and speckled, hanging to the ground.</P>
<PB N="386" REF="245"/>
<P>From what part the Civet is gathered,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what part the Civet is gotten.</NOTE> there have been many different opini∣ons: The famous <HI>French</HI> Physitian <HI>Riolanus</HI> holds it to be the Dung, or Ordure; but <HI>Ruellius</HI> and <HI>Audreas Matthiolus</HI> more truly averre, that it is taken out of the Privities, and that the Cods were the Purse wherein it was bred; others main∣tain it to be the Sweat, or <HI>Sudor,</HI> about those parts, caused by violent motion and beating: but all these opinions vary from the truth; for the part wherein this odoriferous Perfume is found, is distinct and peculiar, lying between the Privities and the Cods, and seems at the first glimpse to be the Matrix: for it hath a long opening, and felt with the Hand, seems of the bigness of a small Egge, and grisly; which being opened with the Finger, two passages appear like Nostrils; under which are some small Cavities as big as Almonds, the place of the Civet, which is taken out thence with a Spoon, or other fit In∣strument.</P>
<P>But beyond all these is that monstrous Creature,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quoias-Morrou.</NOTE> which the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Quoias-Morrou,</HI> or <HI>Worrou;</HI> and the <HI>Portugals, Salvage,</HI> that is, <HI>A Satyr:</HI> It hath a great Head, a heavy Body, fleshy Arms, and strong, no Tail, and goes sometimes upright, and sometimes like an Ape on all four. The <HI>Blacks</HI> re∣port it to be of humane Extract; but by the alteration and change of the Woods and the Wilderness, it is become half a Beast. They sustain themselves in the Woods with Fruit and wild Honey, which they get out of the Trees: and as they are not few, so when they meet, continually fight one with the other. The <HI>Blacks</HI> relate strange things of them, and averre it for an infallible truth, that it not onely over-powers feeble Women, and unmarried Maids, but also dares set upon Armed Men.</P>
<P>The Woods produce also other wild Beasts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tygers and Leopards.</NOTE> as Tygers and Leopards; the first they call <HI>Quelliqua,</HI> the latter <HI>Quelly.</HI> These two bear great enmity to each other; though the Tyger is generally master: wherefore the Leopard, when the Tyger pursues him, with his Tail will wipe out his foot-steps, that so by them he may not be traced. Some of the Antients, knowing the fierceness of the Tyger, attributed to him the command of the Woods: but here, in regard he hurts no Man, but onely Beasts, they make the Leopard the King of the Woods,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Customs are used upon the taking of a Leo∣pard.</NOTE> because he is more dangerous. For this ravening they are hunted and kill'd by all that can, even for their own safety: yet when a Leopard is kill'd, they bring him dead unto the King's Town, there to be cut up and eaten; but if the Resiants there be not acquainted with it before-hand, they will not ad∣mit it without great opposition; and therefore, with Weapons in their hands, every man falls upon the bringers of the Leopard, who come also Armed to abide the expected brunt: Thus meeting, they fight eagerly, till one side be∣come absolute Victors: which for the most part are the King's Men, to whom the Leopard is left as a booty; which they commonly draw into the Town, &amp; with extraordinary mirth convey to the place where they use to exhibit their Sports: where being flea'd, his Skin and Teeth they present to the King: but the People assembled eat the Flesh boyl'd as a great Dainty; spending the re∣mainder of the day in Revelling and Dancing, as at their most solemn Festi∣vals. But the King forbears to eat it, because it is, as we said, accounted the King of the Woods. But if this esteemed Royal Beast be taken by any, that that have neither strength nor confidence to make such a Bravado, they seek out among them some more than usually bold Fellows, who for some inconsider∣able hire will take upon them to bring the Leopard cunningly into the King's Town. These, by the help of one or two Comrades, drag the Leopard thither
<PB N="387" REF="245"/>unseen, and lays it near the Sporting-place; then withdrawing into the House of his acquaintance, waiting till some find it; who upon the first sight with great eagerness cries out: then assembling the People he tells them, <HI>There is yet another King brought in without our knowledge.</HI> Upon this all the People run out of their Houses, and the bringers discovering themselves, every one gives them the hand of friendship, and according to their fashion, indigitate the Person to all their Friends with these words, <HI>You are the Man to whom we may trust in need; we have seen your works,</HI> and so proceed to flea and eat it, as before.</P>
<P>The King sells the Leopards Skin, if he be not minded to sit upon it, nor to lay it upon the earth to tread on; but the Teeth (which are highly esteem∣ed) he bestows upon his Wives, who wear them in stead of Jewels both about their Necks, and upon their Clothes.</P>
<P>Insects breed there innumerably, as Serpents call'd <HI>Tombe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insects.</NOTE> above two foot long, and as thick as an ordinary mans leg, with curious speckled Skins; they have no innate antipathy to man, whom they never offend till hurt or trod on; yet such is their venome, that whosoever they bite dies irrecoverably within two or three hours.</P>
<P>The Serpent <HI>Minia</HI> attains such largeness,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Serpent <HI>Minia.</HI></NOTE> that it can kill and swallow a whole Deer without chewing or tearing to pieces, and devours Boars and many other such like Beasts and Cattel: It lurks for Prey in some bush, which coming within reach, it suddenly seizes, winding two or three times about the body, and twists it self about the loins, till it falls down and dies; of which thus glutted, he lies not able to stir, till his gorged Paunch ha's di∣gested his meal. The Pismires have such a natural enmity to him, that if they find him thus infeebled with his over-feeding, they creep into his body, and kill him. The flesh of this Creature the <HI>Blacks</HI> account good Food.</P>
<P>¶ NOr are Beasts, Insects, and Reptiles onely found here, but Fowls also of divers kinds; particularly <HI>Qualontia,</HI> being of a large size,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eagle.</NOTE> and ve∣ry strong, remaining most in the Woods, and feeding upon the flesh of Ci∣vet-Cats, and other Beasts, and roosting commonly in the high Tree call'd <HI>Banda.</HI></P>
<P>The Bastard-Eagle which they name <HI>Quolantia Clou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bastard-Eagle.</NOTE> keeps most at the Wa∣ter-side, preying on Fish, which swimming near the surface of the water, he takes in an instant.</P>
<P>The Buzzard or Kite call'd <HI>Simby,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kite.</NOTE> feasts it self with the flesh of all other smaller Birds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poi</HI> also a Bird of Prey,

<P>Blue Parrots with red Tails are numerous, roosting on the Palmeto-Trees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parrots.</NOTE> and eating the Nuts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comma</HI> hath great variety of fine Feathers, green about the Neck,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comma.</NOTE> red Wings, black Tails, crooked Bills, and Claws like a Parrot.</P>
<P>There is a Bird in bigness like a Thrush, with black feathers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prognosticating Birds call'd <HI>Clofyf.</HI></NOTE> by them call'd <HI>Clofyf,</HI> who (as they say) by the difference of his chattering, prognosti∣cates either good or bad luck; insomuch, that when any travel through the Woods, if they hear this Bird cry about them, <HI>Kybo fy offygh,</HI> they take that for an ill Omen, and will by no means go any farther that day. On the contrary, if their Journey shall be prosperous, and this Bird cries in another
<PB N="388" REF="246"/>manner, which they expound, <HI>Forward, go on,</HI> in the <HI>Folgiaske Tongue,</HI> they no longer despair, but proceed forward in their Journey so soon as possible. They repute him an ominous and unlucky Bird, and say, that the <HI>Kigbofy</HI> hath sung his Song over all those that die an evil death. He keeps most in places where Pismires frequent, which are his principal food.</P>
<P>There is another little Bird like a Lark,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fonton.</NOTE> call'd <HI>Fonton,</HI> who having found in the Woods a Buffel or Elephant, or Honey in a Tree, or a Tyger, or Snake, or any thing else whether good or bad, immediately flies towards the people, fluttering about them, and making a noise with his wings; whereupon they follow him, saying, <HI>Tonton kerre, Tonton kerre,</HI> that is, <HI>We come.</HI> Then he flies forward chirroping, till come to the thing he would show. But if they do not follow him, nor regard his noise, he never rests flying backward and for∣ward, till perceiving the unmindful Travellers approach near what he would discover, he perches upon a tree; by which sudden settling, they know they are not far from something he would shew to them.</P>
<P>There are also Swallows,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swallows.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Lele</HI> or <HI>Lele-atterecna,</HI> that is, Day-Swallows, to distinguish them from Bats, which they call <HI>Lele-Sirena,</HI> that is, Night-Swallows. The <HI>Blacks</HI> report that they have another sort of Swallows, which they stile <HI>Tonga,</HI> of the bigness of Pigeons, but without any resem∣blance of the other. Their Flesh proves good meat, of which there is no scarcity; being so numerous, that sometimes sitting upon trees in flocks, their great weight tears down whole branches as big as a mans leg.</P>
<P>There is yet another Bird like a Wood-pecker,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fowl which picks the Trees hollow.</NOTE> who with his Bill makes a concave hole in trees, and in that hollow breeds the young; of which the <HI>Blacks</HI> relate this following story.</P>
<P>This Bird (they say) complained in antient times to <HI>Kanou,</HI> that the people stole away his Young where ever he made his Nest, desiring <HI>Kanou,</HI> that for the future he would smother them when they committed such theft. Where∣to <HI>Kanou</HI> seem'd by promise to consent; but enjoyn'd, that in regard the huge trees would hinder the fall of the Heavens, he first cut them down, and then by weight of their fall upon the earth, he would certainly smother the people.</P>
<P>There are many Turtle-Doves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turtle-Doves and Pige∣ons.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Papoo,</HI> and three sorts of Partridges or Pheasants with speckled feathers. The first call'd <HI>Bollend,</HI> hath a tuft on his head; the second, <HI>Kambyge,</HI> bald and without feathers; the third, <HI>Decedeu,</HI> hath black feathers mixt with small white specks, and a white neck.</P>
<P><HI>Cufonfoo</HI> is a Bird as big as a Raven,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cufonfoo.</NOTE> with black feathers, and a very long and broad Bill, making the Nest of earth in the Trees; when the Hen sits, she pulls off all her feathers to lay the young ones in, and remains sit∣ting without any going off, being daily fed by the Cock that flies abroad for food.</P>
<P>There are many <HI>Tigua</HI> or Cranes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cranes.</NOTE> which the Inhabitants of <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> call <HI>Aqua-piaffo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doco,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doco.</NOTE> a very great Fowl, frequenting Moors and Marishy Grounds, as whol∣ly living on Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Jowe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jowe.</NOTE> a small Bird, no bigger than a Linnet, drops her Eggs by the way∣side.</P>
<P>All these, together with white and blew <HI>Herons,</HI> except the <HI>Jowe, Funtan,</HI> and <HI>Kigbofy,</HI> are by them eaten.</P>
<P>Bees, in this Countrey call'd <HI>Kommokesse,</HI> are not kept as in <HI>Europe,</HI> Hiv'd
<PB N="389" REF="246"/>and Hous'd, but swarm as it were wild in the Woods, Nesting in hollow Trees, by which half the Honey is not found.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bremsems,</HI> or Wasps, here call'd <HI>Quun-bokessy,</HI> come into the very Hou∣ses, but yield no Honey; but if disturb'd sting venomously, insomuch that the place stung swells up with great pain.</P>
<P>Besides these they tell of a third, and smaller sort of Bees than the right sort of Honey-Bees, but swarm, and Nest like them in Trees, making Honey rancker or sharper of taste than the other; brown of colour, and the Wax blackish: the Inhabitants name them <HI>Cubolig-boli.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mescito's</HI> are here in such abundance, and so plague the People, that it is impossible almost to sleep, or take any rest for them.</P>
<P>In the time when it rains, which is about <HI>May, June, July, August,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crickets.</NOTE> and <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> some Crickets, call'd <HI>Gelleh,</HI> fall among them from the Clouds, as the <HI>Blacks</HI> themselves report; which are bigger than other Crickets, and afford them food.</P>
<P>Thus much we have thought fit to say concerning the Plants and Beasts, we will now shew you the Employment, Customs, and Nature of the Inhabi∣tants, and what else relates to them.</P>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Quoia's</HI> have no Trade,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Quoia's</HI> are dili∣gent in Tilling.</NOTE> but maintain themselves with Sowing of <HI>Mille</HI> and Rice, and by the planting other Herbs and Fruits; for the Countrey being large, and more than two thirds untill'd and woody, every one may manure what he thinks fit, and cut down as much Wood as he plea∣seth. After a Place hath been once Sown, they let it lie Fallow two or three years, till the Earth, which they suppose impoverished by bearing, hath re∣covered a new vigor by lying uncultured: yet notwithstanding the before∣mention'd liberty for the encouragement of such as take pains, no person may Sow in a Field which hath been Ploughed by another.</P>
<P>In the middle of <HI>January,</HI> or in the beginning of <HI>February,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Planting of Rice.</NOTE> they begin first to order the Fields intended for Rice, cutting down the Wood, Bushes, and Weeds, laying all even and smooth. The Ground thus prepared, one goes before with the Seed, which he sprinkles upon the Ground, while others with crooked Iron-Rakes turn it under the Soyl. This commonly sprouts on the third day; but then must be carefully lookt after, to keep it from Birds, which flock thither in great numbers: but after it hath taken firm Root they mind it no farther, nor have more trouble till grown ripe, and fit for gathering. In some places they are forced to Fence their Fields to keep out wild Beasts, especially Buffles and Water-Elephants, which else would rob them of all the fruits of their labors, and the hopes of the ensuing Har∣vest.</P>
<P>The second Rice-planting is begun in <HI>April,</HI> in the High-land,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second Planting of Rice.</NOTE> and at the time of the first Rains. Those that are good Husbands, and diligent, may sowe Rice three times in one Summer; the first in the Low-land; the se∣cond in higher, and the third in the highest Land; every one a moneth af∣ter the other; because they will not have all ripe at a time, not being able then to get it in; for it must be cut off ear by ear, with great leasure.</P>
<P>The first Crop growing in low and moist places, is cut off in the begin∣ning of <HI>April;</HI> the second in the higher Land, in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July;</HI> the third in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>Such as are wary, save commonly good quantities against the next Seed∣time;
<PB N="390" REF="247"/>whereas more lazy and careless persons that eat up all their store, are compell'd to betake themselves to other places, as to <HI>Hondo, Gala,</HI> or <HI>Gebbe,</HI> where they buy it for Basons, Kettles, Cloathes, or other things.</P>
<P>The Women Manure and Dig the Fields,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Work of the Wo∣men.</NOTE> and Sowe the Rice, and the Men cut down the great Trees, and clear the Bushes, and sometimes help the Women in the rest, to dispatch the sooner. But the chiefest business wherein the Men employ themselves, is Fishing, Hunting, and building of Houses: for those Sports of Hunting and Fishing are free;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting is free.</NOTE> yet all sorts of Hunting is used not by all: for the Hunting of Elephants and Buffles is dangerous, and undertaken by such onely as will venture their lives; for few escape mischief or death at one time or other.</P>
<P>The King hath for his proportion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Revenue of the King.</NOTE> of Elephants and Buffles, one out of two; of Boars, Harts, and other wild Beasts, a third part; but Water-Elephants, and Sea-Cows, belong wholly to the King, who bestows upon the taker a Present of Rice and <HI>Mille;</HI> but yet less than a tenth part. All people are bound to offer the best of the Fruits and Plants to <HI>Belly</HI> their Idol for <HI>Junanen,</HI> that is, for the health of the Souls of their deceased Friends and Parents.</P>
<P>¶ THe Houses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses and Villages.</NOTE> or rather Huts, are round; so likewise the Villages, and inclosed with Trees, standing close together; and with their Boughs Plashed and interwoven, make a good Defence, or Bulwark; the Gates are low, and so narrow, that but one man can go through at a time; the whole Inclosure shadowed with <HI>Bangoela,</HI> that is, Branches of Vine-Trees, or <HI>Tomboe,</HI> bound together so close, that they are forc'd to make certain Holes therein to Shoot through, which they can open and shut at pleasure. At every of the Gates there is a Hut, or moveable Turret, fifteen or sixteen Foot high; which they can carry in time of need, and set in any fit place, made as the Walls, wherein always some exquisite Archers keep Guard, and are as Sentinels, both for discovery of the Enemies approach, and to defend against their assaults.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Town lies an open Green to play in; cross ways leading to the Gates, are Streets, between whose ends and the Tree-Wall, round about, is a passage to go from place to place. The Towns thus fenced with Trees, they call <HI>Sansiah;</HI> but other unfenced, <HI>Fonferah,</HI> that is, an open place: so that properly we may term the former Cities, and the later Villa∣ges or Hamlets.</P>
<P>Into these Fortifications the Countrey people also without restraint repair in time of need, to secure their lives, and what they have from depraedations, and also by their Persons and Valour to defend their Abodes.</P>
<P>By vertue of an antient Law made by the Tribe of the <HI>Karous,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Karous</HI> may not eat Fish with Scales, nor Beef.</NOTE> the Inhabi∣tants are prohibited to eat Beef, or Fish with Scales, which they observe ve∣ry strictly; believing, that if they should break it, they should either in∣stantly die, receive some remarkable judgement, or else fall into phrensie.</P>
<P>The people in general are very libidinous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lustfulness of the In∣habitants.</NOTE> but their ability answers not their desire; however such their too frequent actions, and dealing with vari∣ety of Women, draws upon them no small inconveniences: Nor do the Wo∣men fall short of the men in their Unchastity, wholly giving themselves up to Venerial Exercises; and as if continually troubled with a <HI>Furor Uterinus,</HI> at all times chaw and eat such Herbs and Barks of Trees, as are the greatest In∣centives to heighten their desires to almost hourly Congresses.</P>
<PB N="391" REF="247"/>
<P>Both Men and Women are much inclin'd to drink Brandy; yet they will not give Elephants Teeth in exchange for it, but onely barter Provisions of Victuals.</P>
<P>They are courteous one among another, holding firmly together,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are gentle and cour∣teous.</NOTE> helping each other upon all occasions. Whatever any wants, (wherewith his own store or penury cannot furnish him) his friends and acquaintance supply free∣ly. They shew great Friendship to one another in Gifts of Clothes, and sometimes of Slaves; and in House-keeping live as it were in common, eve∣ry one participating of the others Diet without grudging: None appears, or makes any address to the King empty-handed; insomuch, that all Merchant∣strangers, having any occasion to speak to him, make their way by Presents; some few of the baser sort will steal from Strangers, but yet be just among their own Countreymen; they neither swear, curse, nor quarrel, but have a natural antipathy against those that cause Bloudshed amongst their Neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>There are found many among them which can work strange effects with Herbs, Powders, Characters, and Figures;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They understand Sorcery very much.</NOTE> and some Diabolically mischie∣vous, whom they enstile <HI>Savah-Monou,</HI> that is, Poisoners and Bloud-suckers; be∣cause in the absence of any person they can fetch out his bloud, and bring him by that means into a Malady.</P>
<P>They have amongst them another sort of people call'd <HI>Senearts,</HI> that by Incan∣tations and Charms can mischief a Childe, spoil Rice and Plants, and do other prestigious Facts. This particular Art they call <HI>Pilly;</HI> but all the rest <HI>Sovach-Monousin:</HI> all which though so much practis'd, yet if any Complaint be made against the users thereof, they are punish'd with great severity, and sometimes with Death.</P>

People of quality go always accompanied, partly for the cause aforesaid, partly that they might have aid and assistance at hand, if any wild Beasts should attempt upon them; alledging moreover, that company gives cause of Discourse, and that diverts the Fantasie from melancholy thoughts, which generally bring the <HI>Sovach</HI> to converse with them.</P>
<P>¶ BIgamy and Polygamy are accounted Vertues,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> every Man keeping as many Wives as he can maintain.</P>
<P>The Parents used formerly to procure Wives for their Sons; but finding the Women they get were not regarded, now they let them chuse for themselves, according to their own pleasures. However, before the Marriage, the Bride, according to custom, must be purchased with Presents and Slaves. Such whose small Stocks cannot reach to that, get their Wives by obsequiousness and ser∣vice, that is, they build Houses, draw Wine, work in their Rice-Fields, and do all other things wherein they may be useful; which sometimes endures three or four years before they can attain their desire.</P>
<P>If any take a liking to a Woman brought by the Merchants from a foreign Countrey, with a purpose to Marry her, he makes known his Suit by Presents after their manner: And the like, as we said, if any man cast his affection upon a Maid, who is not reserved for some other Person; but if she be set apart by agreement or promise, they admit no hearing to any other: but the intended Bridgroom invites the Maid in the Evening to come to his House, to eat and drink; which, if she stands upon her honour, she takes no notice of three or four times; but at last goes with her Friends, and after that the solemnity is concluded, the Bride remains sometimes ten or twelve days before she ask for her Bride-Presents, if they live both in one Village; but if the Maid come from the Countrey, and her acquaintaince which have brought her thither, would go away, then she asks for them before their departure. And these must always be paid at three distinct times, <HI>viz.</HI> first she demands her <HI>Cola,</HI> or <HI>Togloe,</HI> which signifies, <HI>Give me somewhat that is next to hand,</HI> whether Beads, or other Ornaments; the second time she requires her <HI>Jasing,</HI> that is, some Goods which the <HI>Whites</HI> bring thither, as Cloth, Garments, or the like; the third time she asks her <HI>Lesing,</HI> that is, a Bason, Kettle, and Chest that she may keep her <HI>Cola</HI> and <HI>Jasing</HI> in, and a Slave that may wait upon her, and look to her Goods: then, when she hath received all her Dowry, she goes with them to her Friends, and so re∣turns from whence she came.</P>
<P>If now this Woman grow with Child, and it happen upon her Delivery to be a Boy, the Father, so soon as it can go, fetches it away; but if it be a Girl, it remains with the Mother.</P>
<P>If the Man be pleased with the Woman that he hath thus had knowledge of
<PB N="393" REF="248"/>then he sends by his people Presents to her Parents for their Good-will; who ask their Daughter of her intentions: if she desires her Parents to receive them, that makes up the Match; if not, they send them back again. After the Marriage thus perfected in this manner, yet the Man must gratifie the Parents, and Maids Companions with some Gifts; which sometimes they retaliate: But to take many Presents from the Womans Parents, turns greatly to his prejudice: for if it happen that the Wife had rather have another Man, or that the Hus∣band will turn her to her Parents, thenceforth all the Presents given to him are demanded back, but what-ever he hath bestowed on her or them, they keep; for he must do no injury to the Woman, nor to her Parents: But if the Wife will be reconciled, she may; for it is at her choise, because the Parents may not force or compel her. But if he have not accepted any of their Gifts, then such a Daughter, if her Husband will, whether she like it or no, must continue with him, and yet shall have no other esteem, than according to the Riches she brings him.</P>
<P>We have said before, that the Men may have as many Wives as they can maintain; but the first Wife that the Man hath Married is the chiefest, and call'd by the other <HI>Makilmah,</HI> that is as much as to say, <HI>The Governess of the Women:</HI> but they are all subjected under the authority of the Husband.</P>
<P>When any that is of Noble Extract will send his Daughter to her Husband, after the Marriage-Presents are compleated, he gives to accompany her in the way, some of his Subjects and Slaves, with two Coats, or Shirts, a Quiver full of Arrows, and a Simiter with a Belt, for a Present for her Husband, and three or four <HI>Kanasters,</HI> or Bags with Rice, and other small trifles.</P>
<P>¶ THe giving of Names to their Boyes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The accustomed Solem∣nity at the naming of their Children.</NOTE> is done with a particular Ceremony, <HI>viz.</HI> when the Childe is eight or ten dayes old, on a set Day, early in the morning, the Person design'd to give the Name, with a great company carrying Bowes and Arrows, comes leaping and shouting with great hurliburly and noise; which others in the Town hearing, go out also with Bowes and Arrows, Assagays or Javelins, and Shields: the company thus assembled, they lay about them, as if fighting with their Enemies. After half an hours playing in that manner, the Name-giver taking the Child from the Mother, layeth it down upon a Shield in the midst of the Concourse, and puts a little Bowe, made for that purpose, into its hand; then he makes a Speech above half an hour long over the Child, admonishing it to be as he is, and to follow his example, to be diligent in Tillage and Husbandry, that he may get much Rice, that he may give to every one to eat that ask it, and thereby to get a praise-worthy Name; not to covet after another Man's Wife, nor to deceive, or cheat, or be treacherous, whereby a Man, says he, shall come to scorn and contempt. This solemnity being ended, he brings the Child to the Mother again: afterwards they must go a Hunting, while others provide Wine: after Noon they return home with the Beast they have caught, of which, boil'd with Rice, they make a Feast; and so, with the Women make themselves merry, and frolick the greatest part of the Night.</P>
<P>But the solemnity at naming a Daughter is not so great; for a Woman, with some few attendants, fetch the Child out of the Mothers House, and lay it upon a Mat, amongst the rest, putting a Stick in its Hand, admonishing it to be dili∣gent and industrious, to wash it self clean, for that cleanness is an ornament to a Woman; to be chaste and modest, not to ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from one Man to another, lest
<PB N="394" REF="249"/>she cast away her own happiness; to be ready to make and cook Dainties, that her Husband may take a good liking to her; and to associate constantly with him at all times: so re-delivering it to the Mother, the Ceremony con∣cludes.</P>
<P>The Women keep from the Men as long as the Children cannot go, or com∣monly till it attain the age of a year and a half; for they believe, unless the Child Suck so long, it would be infected with some remarkable Infirmity.</P>
<P>¶ THe Inhabitants are subject to many strange Sicknesses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Sicknesses.</NOTE> unknown to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> such as these following:</P>
<P><HI>Ibatheba,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibatheba.</NOTE> a kind of Murrain, happening, though not often, among the Beasts; who, as they say, are invisibly struck by splay-footed Dwarfs and Fairies, which they call <HI>Thebano's,</HI> that produceth a Botch, out of which there falls com∣monly a piece of corrupt, or dead Flesh. This Distemper kills Elephants, Buf∣fles, Hogs, Dogs, and many other Beasts: sometimes also Men are infected, but it seldom proves fatal to them.</P>
<P>The Bloody-Flux begun in <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bloody-Flux.</NOTE> in the Year Sixteen hundred twenty and six, and spread it self through the whole Countrey; raging with that vio∣lence and misery, that caus'd a direful Mortality, and swept away such vaste multitudes, that for want of people, the Rice-Tillage stood still above three years together; every one more dreading the day of his Death, than making Provision for the sustaining of such an uncertain Life.</P>
<P>The Meazels here do not seize upon Children onely,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Meazels.</NOTE> but general afflicts both old and young, as an Epidemical Disease, with such a fatality that few escape: and therefore with them it is very much fear'd. The Pain of the Head which the Physicians call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but themselves <HI>Honde-doengh,</HI> is fre∣quent among them: So also the <HI>Jydoeng,</HI> or Pain in the Teeth. Some languish under a continual <HI>Haemorragy,</HI> or Bleeding, till they almost insensibly expire; which they say is effected by the <HI>Sovach,</HI> or his Scholars: Some have lost their Noses and Lips; and others go with sore Arms and Feet, as if totally infect∣ed with the <HI>Morbus Gallicus,</HI> though it proves nothing but a natural course of the Climate, for that it is not contagious to any that converse with them.</P>
<P>Some through anguish of spirit run raving up and down, perfectly distract∣ed; others, as if possest, do many strange Feats, contorting and writhing their Bodies;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colga, or Ideots.</NOTE> a third are meer Ideots, call'd <HI>Colga;</HI> not so born, but happening (as they say) by finding the Nest of a Fowl call'd <HI>Jouwa,</HI> which not onely deprives them of Rationality, but incapacitates them to Virility. They are cur'd of this Disease by Witchcraft; but with this Injunction, they must never taste of any feather'd or flying Fowl.</P>
<P>Some having attained the full Perfection of Age, are suddenly vex'd with a terrible Swelling in their Cods,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The swelling of the Cods.</NOTE> and a Shrinking of their Virile Part, without any possible means of Cure:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are most subject to this Disease.</NOTE> Such as neighbour the Sea, and the places adja∣cent, are most subject to this Malady; to wit, the Inhabitants of <HI>Bolm, Cilm,</HI> and <HI>Bolmberre;</HI> and among them, such as sell and drink immoderately of the <HI>Palmito-Wine;</HI> and therefore it may with reason enough be suppos'd, this Dis∣ease grows by the use of that Wine: but whether so or no, we shall leave it to be determin'd by such, whose Curiosity hath better inform'd their Experi∣ence.</P>
<PB N="395" REF="249"/>
<P>¶ WHen any man dies according to the course of Nature,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eakotima, that is, the de∣parture or Funeral.</NOTE> or by Mis∣chance, presently all his Friends and Acquaintance meet, and encom∣passing the Corpse, sing Elegies and Epicediums, wherein they set forth at large the Praises and Actions of the Deceased in several Languages, every one chusing that wherein he thinks himself best skill'd and able with most Excel∣lency to express his fancy; for besides their own <HI>Quoian,</HI> they can all speak the <HI>Timnian, Hondrian, Mendian, Folgian, Galaan,</HI> and <HI>Gebbian</HI> Tongues.</P>
<P>For they account it a great Honour to have such a Funeral-Elegy compos'd and spoken in a high Strain and lofty Stile: And if any that have no continu∣al or publick Employment, happen at such a time to neglect to shew his Love to his deceased Friend or Relation, by such a Valedictory Gratulation, all his surviving Kindred and Acquaintance will exclaim against him, as one that merits not their kindness living, who will not joyn to lament for them dead.</P>
<P>After the Funeral-Orations are finish'd, the Corpse is washed, the Hair pleated, and the Body set upright, supported with stayes at the Back, and un∣der the Arms. If it be a Man, then they put a Bowe and Arrow into his hand, and array him with his best Garment, and his Friends bring Presents to the Funeral; <HI>viz.</HI> one Needles; another a Kettle or Bason; the third a Garment; a fourth Dishes, and Earthen and Tin Cups.</P>
<P>The Corpse thus set up and drest, some of his nearest Kinsmen come and play with Bowes and Arrows before him; and that done, kneel down with their backs turn'd to the Corpse, and draw the Bowe-string as far as they can, to signifie, that they would fight against his Enemy; and if he were slain in the Wars, or kill'd by any malicious Person, they would with such force take vengeance.</P>
<P>And lastly, a Man or a Woman is left by the Corpse to keep it, and take care to beat away the Flies, and Vermine which otherwise might annoy the body.</P>
<P>When the nearest Relations have finish'd their Ceremonies, and come from the house, immediately some Women of her Acquaintance apply themselves to the Widow to lament and condole with her; and falling down at her feet, use these words, <HI>Bqun e, Bqun e,</HI> that is, <HI>Be comforted,</HI> or <HI>Cease your lamentation.</HI> After the accomplishment of these sorrowful Complaints, the men carry the Corpse upon a Biere to the Grave, commonly made near the Sepulchres of their Ancestors, in some <HI>Tombouroi,</HI> or desolate Village, and there inhume it not above knee-deep; casting into the Ground after him Mats, Kettles, Basons, Beads, or what other Wealth he possest himself with, or was presented after his death, and then fill up the Hole with Earth, covering it over with a painted Mat fasten'd with Pins, and an Iron; close by setting up a Pole, whereon (if it be a Mans Corpse) they hang his Clothes and Arms in the manner of a Trophy; but if it were a Woman, some Pewter Porringers or Dishes are made fast with a Pin to the Ground: And with all convenient speed the Friends erect a Hut over the Grave, as a defence from the Rain, and also for a Monument, that their Memories may not altogether be forgotten.</P>
<P>The Kings Kindred are buried in an Island call'd <HI>Masach,</HI> lying in a Lake belonging to the River <HI>Plizoge,</HI> where King <HI>Flans-Sire,</HI> Father of the present Reigning King <HI>Flambore,</HI> in his life kept his Royal Seat, and now lies En∣tomb'd.</P>
<P>If any of the Friends have been absent, or in a Journey, upon his return he comes to the House of the Deceas'd, though it be two or three moneths after;
<PB N="396" REF="250"/>and falling down at the feet of the nearest Kinsman to the Deceas'd, bewails his loss. If he meets any of his Acquaintance of the near Friends to the De∣ceas'd, he embraces him, and salutes him with these words, <HI>Clau e, Clau e,</HI> that is, <HI>Lament, Lament;</HI> and then talk together of their Affairs.</P>
<P>When any Nobleman dies, one or two of his Slaves or Slavesses are put to death at the Grave, to be his Attendants in the <HI>Elizian Fields;</HI> others wait at the Grave, to whom the Friends of the Dead carry Presents of Bracelets, Beads, Coral, Rice, Tobacco, the Fruit <HI>Kola,</HI> and a Hen boil'd with Rice, which they may dispose as they please.</P>
<P>Though this destroying and killing of Slaves and Slavesses was an old Cu∣stom here, yet it is not much practis'd of late; and those of the Slaves that can run away, or defend themselves with weapons in their hands, are free: Therefore when an Eminent Person is dying, all his Slaves get away where they cannot be found, though the danger of their Lords Death is conceal'd as much as possible. The Run-away-Slaves when they come again, are rail'd at and upbraided with these or such like words: <HI>You will eat of your Lords Cost, but not die with him;</HI> who excuse themselves, saying, <HI>Life is sweet, and no man would willingly leave or have it taken away against his will.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefest of the Friends at the beginning of the Mourning make a Vow of Abstinence, swearing by a holy Token, which they call <HI>Bolly-Gowe,</HI> with lifting up of hands, that they will keep it; for a common Person eight or ten days, and for a Lord, a moneth, or longer; in which time they may not eat any Rice, nor drink out of any whole Vessel or Cup, but onely out of a Pot∣sheard, or a little hole made in the ground; neither do the Men sleep with their Wives, nor may wear any Painted or Colour'd Clothes, but onely Black or White, cut with flashes, shaving their Hair, and sleep upon the bare ground.</P>
<P>When the time is expired, they come to the <HI>Bolly-Gowe,</HI> and discharge them∣selves with up-lifted Hands from the aforesaid Promise and Vow, with assu∣rance that they have kept the same. Lastly, a Funeral-Banquet is prepared; for which the Women boyl Rice, and the Men go into the Woods a Hunting, and bring home what they catch, which they boyl and eat, and so the whole Ceremony concludes.</P>
<P>Those that have fasted are gratifi'd with Presents, every one according to his quality; that is, common persons, one with a Bason, another with a little <HI>Garment,</HI> or Salt-Basket, or a piece of Iron or Mat; but persons of account, with a Staff; Iron, or other Goods, which with them are highly esteemed.</P>
<P>If the acquaintance of the Deceased have any suspicion that he died not a natural Death, they neither wash the Dead, nor lament, till the doubt be resolved; for they say, if any should mourn before, it would be impossible to bring to light the guilty person, because the Spirit of Envy over-hearing it, would not give any intimation of it.</P>
<P>The Enquiry is performed in thismanner: They take the Corps, or in stead of that, a piece of his Cloathes, with pairings of his Nails, and some of his Hair, sewing it up like a Pudding, mixed with scrapings of <HI>Bondu,</HI> or red Dying-wood: this Roll they put into a <HI>Mortar,</HI> where they stamp it. Then two eloquent Men are elected, who stand with two Iron Bills or Halberds be∣fore the Staff-bearers, and clashing their Bills, ask the Dead what he died of; and whether God took him away or no: if yea, then the Staff-bearers nod, as if they were half asleep; but if not, they shiver and shake. In like manner
<PB N="397" REF="250"/>they do upon the other Question of <HI>Who did it? Where is he?</HI> and, <HI>In what man∣ner was it done?</HI> At length they receive answer, that he died a violent Death, being kill'd by some <HI>Bolly;</HI> for <HI>Bolly</HI> is with them all manner of Medicinal Herbs, but the Herb that is venomous or poysonous, is call'd <HI>Sovach.</HI> But if <HI>Bolly</HI> hath kill'd him, then the Names of most Physical Herbs are recited, till they have found which of them was used; concluding however at last, that <HI>So∣vach</HI> hath kill'd him. Then is asked whether he was kill'd by a Man or a Wo∣man: and at last is asked concerning the place of his dwelling, and person. The guilty person being found, immediately they are chained to a great Block, and asked if he or she will acknowledge the Fact. If they can be brought to no acknowledgment, then is given to them <HI>Quony;</HI> or else, upon acknowledg∣ment of the Fact, are cruelly put to death.</P>
<P>This <HI>Quony</HI> is a Rind, or Bark of a Tree so call'd, which in the presence of Friends, by the suspected person, is pull'd off, that the Sap or Juice may be used without any deceit. The outermost scurf of the Bark they pare off, and beat in a Mortar with Water, which after the setling affords a very tart Juice; of which they give to those that are taken, three or four <HI>Kalabasjes,</HI> or Quarts, to drink in the Morning, and not at any other time. In the mean time they conjure and perswade themselves, that if the Captive be guilty of the Crime, he will die, or else not: At last, vomiting the <HI>Quony,</HI> he is held to be quit; but if he cannot do that, though at first he brings up a little Froth, he dies; and the Body is either burnt, or else cast into the River.</P>
<P>But if it happen that they cannot receive any answer, or but such as is un∣certain and Amphibological, resting thereon, though with much dissatisfa∣ction, they forthwith, without farther enquiry, interre the Corps: Yet never∣theless, they go to a <HI>Jakehmo,</HI> or Soothsayer; a vagrant sort of People, who have no certain Dwelling-place, but rove up and down; and before they answer any question, run about distractedly, one with a certain kind of Pots, or Cups; another sounding a Horn; the rest with Tabers, or little Drums, making a great noise and hurliburly, seeking, and calling for the <HI>Sovahmo;</HI> from whom, when they have received any information concerning the guilty person, then they proceed to the trial with the <HI>Quony,</HI> in the manner aforesaid.</P>
<P>¶ IN Right of Inheritance, or possessing of Goods, this method is observed:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inheritance.</NOTE> When the Man dies, and leaves behind him some Children that are un∣der Age, the elder Brother takes the possession of all the Slaves, Wives, Children, moveable and not moveable Goods of his Father, except his own Mother. Thus taking upon himself the government of the Family, after time of mourn∣ing finished, he draws to the place of Exercises before the King, in presence of all his acquaintance, with his Father's Bowe in his hand, and his Quiver of Arrows at his back, one end of the Bowe he sets upon the Ground, holding the other end in his hand; in that posture he declareth openly, that resolving to be valiant, and to follow his Father's course, he will now give a proof be∣fore all the Spectators. After he hath shewed his skill and activity, he pre∣sents himself before the King in the same posture as before, saying, <HI>He is resol∣ved to bear the burthen of his Family, to give the Children under Age an Example, to Till the Ground, to defend the Right of his Family, and what else befits him.</HI></P>
<P>After the Decease of this Son, the next eldest Brother takes all. But if the eldest Son live, and have Children, then his younger Brothers and their Chil∣dren have onely so much of the Estate, as shall keep them till they come to
<PB N="398" REF="251"/>Manhood, and maintain the Slaves or Slavesses given him in his Father's life∣time: for it is the custom in that Countrey, that people of ability bestow up∣on their Children, as well Sons as Daughters, from their Infancy some Slaves.</P>
<P>But if the Father dies, leaving onely Daughters, either his Father's Brother, if living, or else his Father's Brother's Son, that the Name may not be extinct, shall inherit.</P>
<P>But if there be no Male-issue of the Father's side, the King is Heir, and takes as well Slaves as Goods and Women to him, allowing a sufficient mainte∣nance to some trusty Person for the bringing up of the Children.</P>

<P>The People of <HI>Gebbe</HI> and <HI>Folgia</HI> differ in Speech but little; however the <HI>Fol∣gian,</HI> being the smoothest and the noblest, is call'd <HI>Mendi-ko, The Lordly-Tongue;</HI> partly (as we said) for its Elegancy and Smoothness, partly because of the Dominion the <HI>Folgia's</HI> hold over the <HI>Quoia's,</HI> and <HI>Gebbe-Monou,</HI> that is, the Peo∣ple of <HI>Gebbe;</HI> for <HI>Monou</HI> in that Idiom signifies People.</P>

<P>¶ THe Authority and Greatness of <HI>Quoia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Strength and Power.</NOTE> is at present supported more by Wisdom and Policy, than by Power; because the subjected Countreys of <HI>Cilm, Bolm,</HI> and <HI>Bolmberre,</HI> are accounted more powerful than it. This the Parable of King <HI>Flamboers</HI> Brother, nam'd <HI>Cia-Haddo,</HI> seem'd to hint to <HI>Flamboere's</HI> eldest Son, threatning <HI>Massakoey,</HI> Lord of <HI>Bolm,</HI> to take his Coun∣trey. <HI>There was</HI> (said he) <HI>in antient time a Fowl, with a very fine red Head and Neck, but beyond that, thin of Feathers, and a small Train; but for his beautiful out-side appear∣ance, was by other Birds chosen King: This Bird sensible of his own defects, kept in a Bottel; and when the Council of Fowls was assembled, put the Head and Neck onely out; till at length by course of time, the great Sacrifice was to be made to the Idol</HI> Belli <HI>in the Wood, which none but the King in Person might perform; at which time compell'd to dissert his Bottle, his poverty and wants were discover'd to his great damage.</HI> Thus far <HI>Cia-Haddo.</HI> And without doubt he discover'd a great Prudence in that witty Apo∣thegm; for to prevent discovery, it is not permitted to the People lying Northwards, to pass through the Easterly Countreys; nor for those of the East, to go with their Ambassadors or Merchants through the West Coun∣trey: and this (as we said) that they should not discover the Secrets, and Conveniences or Inconveniences of the State; therefore they of <HI>Quoia</HI> keep them at distance, and traffick for Eastern Wares at reasonable Rates, which they vent to the West, in Exchange for such as are fit for Barter; and Exchange with <HI>European</HI> Merchants, for such Commodities as yield ready Truck with those of the East.</P>

<P>The Heir is laid flat upon the ground, with his Face downward, and some Earth thrown upon him: Lying thus, they ask what Name he desireth to have; and what he chuses, they impose together with the Title of <HI>Dondagh.</HI> Then they cause him to rise, and put a Bowe into his hand, and a Quiver of Arrows, to defend the Countrey with; which performed, he distributes Slaves, Clothes, Kettles, Basons and such like Presents to the King of <HI>Quoia.</HI></P>
<P>The Power of the present <HI>Quoian</HI>-Prince is absolute and unlimited; so that he is the onely and sole Judge of all Causes: For although he admit his Coun∣sellors sometimes to give their Opinions, yet they signifie nothing, for he fol∣lows his own single resolved Determinations.</P>
<P>This absolute Power makes him jealous of his Honor: For, he will not en∣dure it should be diminished by any. His highest Pomp consists in sitting upon a Shield, whereby he gives to understand, that he is the Protection and De∣fence of the Countrey, and the manager of all Wars, pacifying Civil Insur∣rections, and other Weighty Matters belonging to him alone. His Title as we said is <HI>Dondagh,</HI> which is as much as <HI>Monarch.</HI></P>
<P>When any Nobleman proves disobedient and will not appear before him on Summons, then he sends his <HI>Koredo,</HI> that is, his Shield,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what manner the King deals with any man who keeps away from his duty.</NOTE> as if he would say upbraidingly, if you be not obedient, be Lord your self, and bear the burden of the Countrey. This peremptory Command by the Shield is sent by two Drummers, who as soon as they come near the Offenders Habitation, begin to beat their Drums, and so continue without ceasing, till they have delivered the Shield; upon receipt whereof, without delay, he must speed away to the Court, carrying the Shield with him, which he presents to the King, begging forgiveness of his miscarriages; and so taking up Earth before the King, hum∣bles himself.</P>
<P>¶ THose that make an Address to the King to obtain his Favor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An address to the King to obtain his favor, now it is made.</NOTE> make their way with Presents of Ribbons, Elephants-Teeth, or such things which he must deliver at the house of the Kings chiefest Wife; who receiving
<PB N="400" REF="253"/>the same bears it to the King, with request, that the person may be admitted to his Presence: If the King accept it, the person hath leave to enter, other∣wise, if any complaints be brought against him, he sends it back, yet so, as the Presenter dares not receive and carry it away, but continues his Suit by Friends without intermission; by whose frequent and renewed mediations, the King at last seeming a little pacified, remits his severity, takes the Present, and calls for the Suppliant; who entring the Royal Presence, goes bowing all along towards the King, who sits on the ground upon a Matt, leaning upon a Stoole: when he approaches within two steps, he bows himself to the Earth, kneeling down upon one Knee with his right Elbow to the Earth, and names the Kings Title, <HI>Dondagh:</HI> whereupon the King if pleas'd answers, <HI>Namady,</HI> that is, <HI>I thank you,</HI> if not, sits silent. If it be a person of Quality, and his Subject, the King perhaps causes a Matt to be spread on the ground, upon which sit∣ting at the distance of a Pace, he declares what he hath to request. But if he be a Foraigner that comes onely to Salute the King, without any further Cere∣mony he is conducted to him, receiving an immediate dispatch. If the person have any Proposition, Petition or Complaint to make, upon notice thereof, a <HI>Jilly,</HI> or Interpreter is call'd, who coming with his Bow in his hand, opens to the King the whole matter, sentence by sentence; whereto according to the qua∣lity of the Affair, he receives answer, with promise, if upon a Complaint, that as soon as he hath heard what the other party can say in his defence, he will forthwith give Judgment according to Right.</P>
<P>If any man come to thank the King for doing Exemplary Justice in a dif∣ficult Cause,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the King is thank'd for doing good Justice.</NOTE> after his Presents receiv'd, he devests himself of all his Clothes and Ornaments, saving onely a little Cloth to cover his <HI>Pudenda;</HI> so casts him∣self backwards upon the ground, and instantly turning again, rises upon one knee, takes up earth with his hand, and lays it upon his head; then leaning with one elbow upon the earth, he says three times, <HI>Dondagh:</HI> whereupon the King answers some times, <HI>Namady,</HI> that is to say, <HI>I thank you;</HI> and some∣times otherwise, as he thinks fit.</P>
<P>The first Address usually is perform'd in his own House in the presence of his chiefest Wife. But such as concern Justice, or the State of the Countrey, he hears in the Council-House, in the presence of the Lords of the Council: This Assembly they call <HI>Simannoe.</HI></P>
<P>When some Eminent Person sent from a Neighbor King desires Audience, one of the Kings Wives goes with a Present, and tells him who sent it: where∣upon the Person appears before the King, and takes earth.</P>
<P>When an Ambassador sent from another great Prince approaches the Bor∣ders, he gives notice of his coming; whereupon he is order'd to remain in the next Town till all be made ready, as is requisite in the Kings Town. There he is receiv'd with great Festivals, which consists in Exercising with Bowes and Arrows, Assagays, Launces and Shields, as if they were fighting against Enemies, with great Drummings and Songs of War; which the Ambassador having seen, and the Sport ended, the King retires to the Council-House; where after a little stay, enquiry is made if the King may be saluted; where∣upon having permission, the Ambassador enters, and kneeling upon his knee with his back to the King, and his Bowe in his hand bent to the utmost, allusively implying, that he will set himself to the utmost against his Enemies. In the intervals of these Passages, the Ambassadors Followers chant forth his Praises, as before the Kings Servants sung Elogiums to his Honour. These

<P>This Address the King receives in his <HI>Simannoe,</HI> or Council-House, being open on all sides, with great attendance round about. After this Gratulato∣ry Salutation, the Ambassador desires leave to relate his Embassie, but is put off till the next day; so retiring, he diverts himself till the appointed time in Feasts and Sportive Recreations.</P>
<P>The Ambassador receives Answer by the Kings Direction from a <HI>Jilly,</HI> or In∣terpreter; after which they shew the Ambassador and his Retinue the place where they are to remain; where the Kings Slaves bring them Water to wash, and the Kings Women bring very neatly drest, in Dishes set on their heads, Rice and Flesh, much or little, according to the number of his Attendants. The Entertainment ended, the King sends him for his Welcome, Wine, and other Presents, either a Kettle, Bason, or such like.</P>
<P>If any <HI>European</HI> Merchant bring the King a Present, he is invited to eat with him; but with no <HI>Black,</HI> how great of State soever, will he eat out of the same Dish: but lets their Meat be carried by his Women to the place where they are.</P>
<P>When the King dies, the eldest Brother succeeds in his Throne,

<P>The <HI>Folgia's</HI> are under the Emperor of <HI>Manou,</HI> or <HI>Manoe,</HI> a mighty Prince;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Folgia's</HI> are under the <HI>Manou's.</HI></NOTE> who receives of them yearly Tributes in Slaves, Salt, red Cloth, Kettles, Ba∣sons, and such like: for which he bestows on them as a Gratuity, certain Cloathes call'd <HI>Quaqua-Cloathes,</HI> which the <HI>Folgian</HI> send to the <HI>Quoians,</HI> as they again to the <HI>Bolmian,</HI> or <HI>Hondoian</HI> Lords.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Gala-Monou</HI> also give Presents to this King of <HI>Monou</HI> yearly, whose Name at present is <HI>Quawawoe,</HI> but his Predecessors was <HI>Mendino;</HI> but the <HI>Folgia's,</HI> as an acknowledgment of their accustomed subjection to them of <HI>Monou,</HI> call them <HI>Mendi-Manou,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Lord,</HI> the word properly so sig∣nifying. For the same cause the <HI>Quoians</HI> have the like Title of <HI>Mendi-Monou</HI> both from the <HI>Folgia's, Bolmasses,</HI> and <HI>Timnasses.</HI> And this Power of the <HI>Mendi-Monou</HI> is (as we said already) more maintain'd by Wisdom than Force.</P>
<P>The <HI>Folgia's</HI> are esteemed Rich, and their Language Courtly and Eloquent; which wins great respect, and by their Neighbors call'd <HI>Mendi-Co, The Lordly Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>¶ <HI>HOndo</HI> hath many several Princes; the chiefest, appointed by the <HI>Quoians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Government of <HI>Hondo.</HI></NOTE> are <HI>Mossilago, Dedowach, Dangoerro,</HI> and <HI>Dandi,</HI> each lying far distant from the other.

<PB N="402" REF="255"/>
<P>¶ THe <HI>Quoians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Religion.</NOTE> as also those of <HI>Bolm, Timna, Cilm, Folgia, Hondo, Gala,</HI> and <HI>Manou,</HI> are all Circumcised according to the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> manner, and acknowledge one God, the Creator of Heaven, Earth, and Men; and jointly with these they worship no visible earthly Creature; but they highly honour the Sun, Moon, and Stars. They neither represent the Deity nor Spirits in the shape of Men or Beasts; onely in <HI>Bolma</HI> and <HI>Timna</HI> some Images, by them call'd <HI>Janaa,</HI> they set in the Ways, and by their Houses, as remembrances of their deceased Ancestors and Friends.</P>
<P>They believe that the Almighty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their great Superstition concerning the Souls of the Deta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed.</NOTE> whom they call <HI>Kanuo,</HI> will punish all their misdeeds, and encourage well-doing; therefore they call upon him when they are oppressed, for his presence and aid; and that he will take no∣tice of their Cause, and do them Justice; continually inculcating in all their speeches; <HI>That there shall a time come, in which all evil-doers shall receive their wages.</HI></P>
<P>They believe that their Friends after their death become Spirits; which they call <HI>Jannack,</HI> or <HI>Jannanen,</HI> and say, that they are omniscient to take cognisance of all Causes which happen among them; and therefore they hold familiar Colloquies with them, telling them all troubles and adversities under which they labour.</P>
<P>Those that go into the Woods to Hunt,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Offers or Sacrifices to their deceased Parents.</NOTE> and take Elephants, or Buffles, or begin any other dangerous Enterprize, go first and offer to the Spirit of their deceased Parents, either a Cow, or Wine, or Rice, which they leave on the Grave.</P>
<P>The high times of Sacrificing are kept among them with great Joy, Dan∣cing and Singing. But besides those solemn times, the King calls upon the Souls of his Father and Mother almost in every Matter of difficulty.</P>
<P>They believe the Spirits of their near acquaintance are protectors of their Houses, and therefore in all Sorrow and Sickness they bring Wine and Food out of their Houses into the Way, and there leave it for an Offering.</P>
<P>They say farther, that these Spirits have their habitation in the Woods: whereupon all that are distressed, and look for help from God by them, go thither, complaining and lamenting their affliction; but with awful reverence: for how great soever any man is, yet he fears very much in the presence of God. For this cause all acts of Devotion are performed in those solitary Re∣cesses; into which no Women or Children may be permitted to come.</P>
<P>In this Place twice; thrice, or oftner in the year, according to the fruitful∣ness of the Season, and when Hunting is good, all sorts of Meat-offerings are brought to feed the Spirits.</P>
<P>They say Circumcision hath been received among them from hand to hand from all antiquity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumcision.</NOTE> and that God hath commanded it.</P>
<P>They Circumcise Children at half a year old, though sometime, by the Mothers tenderness, they are kept to the second or third year; but then the Cure proves more difficult, because the Children going naked, the Air and Sun make the Cut swell and fester; which they heal by washing with the Juice of green Herbs.</P>
<P>They have together with Circumcision another Custom, which they call <HI>Belli-Paaro,</HI> whereby they say they become incorporated into the society of Spirits, and therefore take part with them in eating the before-mention'd Offerings. But this is kept hidden from Women, and unskilful persons; to whom they affirm, that the <HI>Jaananen,</HI> or Spirits themselves eat it: And if any
<PB N="403" REF="255"/>dare be so bold, as either out of covetousness or curiosity to peep into this secret, if it happen to be known, they are by some sudden and undiscovered means im∣mediately made away.</P>
<P>The received Tokens of <HI>Belli-Paaro</HI> are seldom shewn, <HI>viz.</HI> once in twenty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When it is done.</NOTE> or five and twenty years, and then they tell strange Stories of it, and how they came to the high favour of receiving them: which are nothing else but some rows of Cuts, from the Neck along both the Shoulder-blades.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they are.</NOTE> Those that have them are accounted very understanding persons: and when they grow old, in all Assemblies and Councils, relating to State-Affairs, or Causes Criminal, wherein Life is concern'd, may be present, and give their opinion.</P>
<P>Of the manner of receiving these Marks, take this short account:</P>
<P>There is by the Kings order a place in the Wood appointed of about two or three miles compass,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are received in the Wood.</NOTE> whither are brought the Youths that have not been Marked, by main force and against their wills, because they believe they shall be kill'd or chang'd; and therefore they take a sorrowfull farewell of their Friends and Parents, as if they went indeed to their death.</P>
<P>When now they are lodged in the Wood, continually some Ancient per∣sons which have had the Tokens of <HI>Belli-Paaro</HI> very long, attend to teach and instruct them what behavior they shall use; leading them a strange and <HI>uncouth</HI> Dance, and causing them to learn some <HI>Verses</HI> which they call <HI>Belli-Dong,</HI> being Songs and Encomiums of <HI>Belli,</HI> stuffed with obscene and scurrulous lan∣guage.</P>
<P>Hither the women bring Rice, <HI>Bonano's,</HI> and all sort of Fruit, prepared for an Offering, and give it up to the <HI>Soggonoe,</HI> that is, the <HI>Ancientest Marked,</HI> whom the women hold for Saints, praying them by all means to hinder that their Children in the change should not be burnt to ashes. Thither also goes the King, and stays two or three days.</P>
<P>This living in the Wood continues four or five years; during which time there are new comers daily brought thither.</P>
<P>None unmark'd may come near this place, onely women in manner before mention'd, and they too must come and go singing with a loud noise; for if it fall out that any pass by silently, they are taken away by the Spirits, without ever being heard of more.</P>
<P>When they come out of this Wood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they do when they come out of the Wood.</NOTE> they are brought by the <HI>Belli-Soggonoe</HI> into Huts made for that purpose, where they are permitted to eat and drink familiarly with the women, and afterwards are anew instructed in causes which concern the Wars, Justice, and Government.</P>
<P>At their first coming abroad, they behave themselves as if they then came newly into the world, not knowing (or at least wise so pretending) where their Parents dwell, and so totally changed, that they have forgot their Names; nor indeed do they the meanest or most common act of Childhood, without being first tutor'd therein by the <HI>Soggonoe.</HI></P>
<P>At this their beginning appearance,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are clothed when they come out of the Wood.</NOTE> they are habited with Plumes of Fea∣thers, and Caps made of the Bark of Trees, with long flappets hanging down before their Faces. After some days stay in the Huts, in such array, with Bells about their Legs, and Beads mixt with Leopards Teeth about their Necks, and their Hair plaited, they are brought openly to the Sporting-place, where the women and other people of all sorts, of all Towns and Villages lying round about, are gathered together to see them Dance the <HI>Belli-Dance,</HI> the postures whereof they learned in the Wood.</P>
<PB N="404" REF="256"/>
<P>Those whose dull apprehensions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Belli</HI>-Dance.</NOTE> or unactive bodies have not carried them forward to perform their parts in this Dance, are contemned, as having spent their time in abhorr'd idleness.</P>
<P>After the end of the Dance, every one call'd by his new name, receiv'd in the <HI>Holy Wood</HI> from the <HI>Soggenoe,</HI> is delivered to his Parents with these words, <HI>These are your Parents or Tutors, learn hereafter to know one another again.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mark'd must swear by <HI>Belli-Paaro.</HI></NOTE> Every one of them must swear by <HI>Belli-Paaro,</HI> that is, by <HI>Divine Ju∣stice, That he will do the Command imposed on him; that he will not withdraw out of this or that Town, nor reproach any persons or places, or carry any thing away, or hinder the passing of the</HI> Canoo's, <HI>or keep Oyl, Nuts, and Houses:</HI> Then they put a Stick in the Earth, with a bush of Rushes, resembling a Broom on the top, and Charm it by these words, <HI>Hucquonono Hucquo, Hucquonono Hucquo, Hucquonono Hucquo,</HI> which concern <HI>Belli</HI> onely, and are not used otherwise in the Language. Who ever offends against this Oath, receives punishment according to the weighti∣ness of the matter.</P>
<P>In case of breaking this Determination,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Punishment of such as transgress this Adjura∣tion.</NOTE> the Falsifier is laid into a Basket with Thorns, and so rowl'd thorow the Town, and back again, till that his skin and flesh is torn; besides they give him <HI>Buasille,</HI> that is, Pepper mixt with wa∣ter, which they put into his Mouth, Eyes, Ears, and strow or sprinkle it over his whole Body.</P>
<P>But the Trial of Adultery by this kind of Oath,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Adjuration in case of Adultery.</NOTE> is made by the Magistrate after many Pre-admonitions, and inflicted onely upon the transgressing Wo∣man, according to this Custom.</P>
<P>The complaining Husband, who will have his Wife tryed by <HI>Belli,</HI> or be deliver'd up to the Spirits, as they call them; brings her in the Evening into the Sporting-place, before the Council assembled for that purpose; where af∣ter the calling of the <HI>Jannanen</HI> into her company, she is blindfolded, that she may see nothing, and admonish'd to forsake her evil life, and not go to any but her own Husband; and presently a great noise and murmure is rais'd, as if Spirits did appear, with some not intelligible (though articulate) Sounds, that are interpreted aloud before the whole Congregation, with threatnings, that if ever she commit such an offence again, she shall be punish'd according to her deserts; and if she be ever thereafter detected of the like Crime, she shall, together with her Paramour, be carried away by the <HI>Jannanen.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, some are adjur'd for breaking the Decrees made by the King, or the Magistrate, for Bloudshed, and for taking away the Slave of an∣other, and selling him, and such like.</P>
<P>Now this taking away of Offenders by the <HI>Jannanen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Offenders are car∣ried away by the <HI>Jannanen.</HI></NOTE> is made terrible by this means; In the Evening with a great rushing noise comes into the Town, their <HI>Belli. Soggenoe</HI> having certain Rattle-clappers, making a great noise, so that the common people wonder at the hurliburly; being come to the Sporting∣place, where the Offenders are set, they take with them as many as are there, with such a fearful Clamour, that the Out-cries of the Offenders cannot be heard; so are they hurried to the <HI>Holy Wood,</HI> from whence they never return. During the time of this Performance, no Woman or unmark'd person may look out of the house, upon pain of being fetcht from thence in like manner.</P>
<P>This <HI>Belli-Paaro</HI> is also common in <HI>Hondo,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the <HI>Belli-Parro</HI> is in use.</NOTE> Folgia, Gala,</HI> and <HI>Gebbe;</HI> also a∣mong the <HI>Bolmesses</HI> and <HI>Cilmesses.</HI></P>
<P>And though it is apparent enough,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How highly <HI>Belli</HI> is e∣steem'd by them.</NOTE> what it is to be kill'd by <HI>Belli,</HI> for that
<PB N="405" REF="256"/>the Execution of <HI>Belli</HI> is but the Kings Form of Justice; yet no man dares for fear of Death, take upon him to interrupt it: For the <HI>Belli-Soggenoe</HI> hold this Ceremony to be so Sacred, and have it in such high esteem, that the King himself (who is as it were the Head of <HI>Belli</HI>) declares himself his Vassal, and to be subject to his Mysteries. Indeed he takes care in the Council,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are free from <HI>Belli.</HI></NOTE> that none be adjur'd by <HI>Belli,</HI> nor that the <HI>Jannanen</HI> take away any without his know∣ledge or consent; onely inflicting that Punishment upon his own Subjects, though sometimes a few have dar'd to resist it, and fly into another Province rather than submit.</P>
<P>And here we may observe, that none is given up to the <HI>Jannanen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water to know if any be guilty or not guilty.</NOTE> but with good Consideration, and upon clear Evidence of Guilt; to prove which, they have a Water of Cursing, boyl'd of Barks and Herbs, which by the Elders of the Mystery is put upon the hand of the charg'd Party lukewarm; if he be innocent, it will not hurt; but will corrode and burn the Skin off, if guilty.</P>
<P>Thus is Adultery, Thievery, and Lying try'd.</P>
<P>The foresaid Water of Cursing, or rather of Divination, wherewith they ex∣tort the Truth in all doubtful matters, as we have related, is thus prepared. The <HI>Bollimo</HI> takes the thick Rind of the great Tree <HI>Nelle,</HI> and the Rind of <HI>Quo∣ny,</HI> growing also upon a great Tree bearing Seed, used in the making of Poy∣son for their Arrows; and mixed with water, as we said, is given to them to drink who are accused of <HI>Sovach.</HI> Thirdly, He takes some leaves of the <HI>Borrow</HI>-Tree, from which beaten and pressed proceeds a white Juyce, which with some mitigating Ingredients makes an excellent Purge, but the strongest taken alone is mortal Poyson. Moreover, the <HI>Bollimo</HI> adds to the before-recited long Pepper, and a piece of <HI>Mannoone</HI> about the bigness of a Bean. All these are put into a little Pot or Horn, and filled up with the Urine of a young man that had never known a woman. This done, they scrape in a little <HI>Bonda,</HI> that is, red Dying-weed. Lastly, daubing the four sides of the Pot with <HI>Mannoone</HI> chawed in the mouth, it is ready to be set on the fire, which must be made un∣der the open Heaven in the morning at Sun-rise, or in the evening at Sun-set, of green Wood. As soon as the water begins to boil, the <HI>Bollimo</HI> takes a piece of <HI>Domboo,</HI> being a Tree that bears fruit like a Medlar, and puts it under the Seeth∣ing Pot; in the mean time trying whether the Ingredients have boyl'd enough, and repeating secretly the names of the suspected persons, or of other matters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this Sorcery-water is used.</NOTE> to which the Witchcraft must be applied. When all is ready, the <HI>Bollimo</HI> takes the arms or legs of the suspected persons, and washeth them clean with fair water. At length he puts his Divining-Staff, which is bruised and tufted at the end, into the Pot, and drops or presseth the water out of it upon the arm or leg of the suspected person, muttering these words over it: <HI>Is he guilty of this, or hath he done this or that;</HI> if yea, <HI>then let it scald or burn him, till the very skin come off.</HI> Now if the person remain unhurt they hold him innocent, and proceed to the trial of another, till the guilty be discovered; and this is done so long, till the name of the guilty, or the person be found out.</P>
<P>The Criminal thus found, is without any long procrastinating put to death. The manner of which, according to the variety of Places is different; but the most usual thus: The Executioner takes the Offender, and leads him with his Hands tied behind, and his Eyes blind-folded, either into an open Field or a Wood; whither being come, the Offender upon his Knees, his Head bowed down, he first runs through the Body with an Assagay, or Simi∣ter,
<PB N="406" REF="257"/>and afterwards chops off his Head with an Axe: for they do not believe he is dead till his Head be cut off. The Carcase cut into four quarters, after great lamentations, they leave in the Field as a Prey to the Beasts and Fowl, but the Friends take away the Head as a great Present, and boiling it in a Kettle, drink up the Broth, but hang the Scull by their <HI>Fetisso,</HI> or Idol.</P>
<P>The like Trial is also made of other Offences among the <HI>Blacks</HI> in <HI>Quoia;</HI> and also in <HI>Gala, Hondo, Bolm, Cilm,</HI> and many other Places: so that every one had need to be circumspect and careful to prevent suspicion, especially the Women, who are for every trifling Caprichio of their Husbands, brought in question of their Honesty.</P>
<P>Now if one of the King's Women lash out,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Punishment of chief Women for Adultery.</NOTE> or go abroad after other Men, and the King be enraged against it, then he causeth them to be so posses∣sed, that if they touch any Masculine person, small or great, they suddenly fall into a kind of Epileptick Fit; according to which three Wives of the present King <HI>Flamboere</HI> suffered: one of which receiving her Daughters Child, not knowing it was a Boy, fell into a Swoon, and might therein have died, if the other Women had not run to the King, and beseeched him that the <HI>Bollimo</HI> might release her from the Curse. But because this is an extraordinary thing, no other but the King himself may put it in execution, and that very seldom.</P>
<P>¶ ANd as the Men have the Marks of <HI>Belli,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marks of <HI>Nesogge;</HI></NOTE> so here the Women have a Mark of Obligation, which they call <HI>Nesogge;</HI> which first took origi∣nal from <HI>Goula,</HI> and done in manner following: They bring ten, twelve, or more Maids of full Age, as also Women, into a peculiar place in the Wood not far from the Town; where first Huts are made for them, then a Woman comes out of <HI>Goula,</HI> whom they call <HI>Soghwilly,</HI> to be the chiefest in this Work of the <HI>Garnoer,</HI> or <HI>Vala Sandyla,</HI> as they term it. This <HI>Soghwilly,</HI> or Priestess gives the Assembly Hens to eat, with the Obligation to stay with her in that place, which she names <HI>Sandy-Latee,</HI> that is, <HI>Hens of the Agreement.</HI> After that she shaves off their Hair, and the next day brings them to a Brook in the Wood, where the aforesaid <HI>Soghwilly,</HI> by Incision cut out the Mother, not without great pain and terror; then washing and healing the Wound with green Herbs, which sometimes requires ten or twelve days time.</P>

<P><HI>Flonikerry</HI> had long before desir'd of the King,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flonikerry</HI> desires some Countreys to Farm of the King of <HI>Folgia.</HI></NOTE> that he and his people might have design'd to them some places of the Countrey, upon promise to pay Tribute: To answer this Request, several things fell under consideration, at length <HI>Cabo Monte</HI> was propos'd; whereupon there was several long Debates between the King and his Nobility; but the King remembring his Generals honest Perfor∣mances for himself against those of <HI>Rio Cestos,</HI> and in <HI>Gala</HI> for the Service of his Son-in-law, resolving to content him in it, said, <HI>I shall do the desire of his heart;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King appoints to go against the Countrey of <HI>Cape de Monte.</HI></NOTE> and gave him leave to go thither with the <HI>Karou's,</HI> sending a considerable Force with him for his help, that he might not be repulsed.</P>
<P>The Commanders of the Army that went out of <HI>Folgia</HI> to the <HI>Cape de Monte</HI> with <HI>Flonikerry,</HI> were these; <HI>Jelliva, Syala, Juba, Selboela, Mamnos, Syfre</HI> of the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Mesurado</HI> and <HI>Fesiach, Flonikerry</HI>'s Brothers-Son.</P>
<P>As soon as the Field-Officers with their Souldiers came to <HI>Cape de Monte</HI> on the South side about <HI>Tomby,</HI> they invaded the <HI>Vey-Monou;</HI> who being numerous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Karou</HI>'s come with their Army near the <HI>Vey-Monou's.</HI></NOTE> and withal of a haughty courage, were not quickly master'd; but the continual Onsets of the <HI>Karou's</HI> at length tired them out, for they shot poysoned Ar∣rows, whose wounds proved irremediably mortal; whereas the <HI>Vey's,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They overcome them by shooting of poyson'd Ar∣rows.</NOTE> not be∣ing accustomed to such Fights, used onely Darts, and Assagayes or Lances, having no skill in preparing Poyson; so that finding they could not any lon∣ger defend themselves, they went with their Hoods upon their heads to <HI>Quolm,</HI> a Fort of the <HI>Karou's,</HI> erected at the River <HI>Plizoge,</HI> a little Eastward of <HI>Tomby,</HI> to ask favour, which <HI>Flonikerry</HI> naturally inclined to pity, easily granted, bid∣ding them go lie down with their Faces to the ground, according to the man∣ner of the Countrey in such case; then coming out, he trode upon them with his Feet. He made an Agreement with them as followeth: First,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of making an Agreement.</NOTE> some Hens were kill'd in the presence of them all, of whose bloud the conquered swal∣lowed a little, as a token of Agreement. Afterwards the dead Hens were boyl'd, and the flesh eaten among them, onely the legs were kept for a perpetual re∣membrance; for if any man after that time transgressed or broke his promise, to him were the legs shown; who upon sight thereof soon recanted, for fear of the punishment that after would assuredly follow.</P>
<P>In the consideration of this success, <HI>Flonikerry</HI> overjoy'd, let loose his thoughts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The former successful Victory of <HI>Flonikerry</HI> made him insolent.</NOTE> giving them free scope to range further; but first for assuring his new con∣quer'd Dominion, he sought by all means to win the minds of the vanquish'd to him, and to contract a firm League of friendship and correspodency with the <HI>Karou's</HI> of his own Countrey. But wavering fortune that minds nothing less than the continuance of friendship, will blemish his new gotten glory, with
<PB N="410" REF="259"/>a dire and unexpected mishap; for scarce were the minds of the <HI>Vey's</HI> or <HI>Karou's</HI> united, but there came out of <HI>Gala, Miminique,</HI> Son of the aforesaid named <HI>Ma∣nimassah,</HI> with a great Army of <HI>Gala's</HI> and others, to make War upon the <HI>Karou's</HI> and <HI>Vey's,</HI> to whose design his Father was not unwitting, having voluntarily forgotten the kindnesses received from <HI>Flonikerry's</HI> Arms, in the Conquest of his now acquired Dominion. Wherefore <HI>Flonikerry</HI> upon the first intelligence, drew together his Forces, to which joyning the <HI>Veys,</HI> he formed a considera∣ble Army; wherewith marching towards the Enemy, they soon met and came to a Battel, wherein the <HI>Gala's</HI> at first by their multitude put the <HI>Karou's</HI> to a disorderly Retreat, which <HI>Flonikerry</HI> a valiant and undaunted person seeing, and not used to shrink before his Enemies, digged with his hand a hole in the ground, and put his knees in it, with a resolution, either to die there, or re∣main Conqueror over his Enemies. And indeed he had his desire in the one, for after a long and sharp Contest, at length as it were covered with Assagayes and Arrows, he was slain on the spot. However, his men gathering fresh courage to revenge their Princes death, Rally'd and gave a fresh Charge upon their Enemies with such fury, that they turn'd the fortune of the day, and be∣came solely masters of the Field.</P>
<P>But the death of <HI>Flonikerry,</HI> whose body they buried in the Fort <HI>Quillone,</HI> was sometime kept secret, till they sent for his Brother <HI>Zyllymanque</HI> to take his Charge, who immediately accepting the same, pursued the Victory, and drew near to the Camp, where he soon brought under the <HI>Puymonow,</HI> giving their Spoil as a Booty to his Souldiers.</P>
<P>After this Victory he marched with his Army to <HI>Quoia-Monou,</HI> lying along the River <HI>Magwibba,</HI> or <HI>Rio Nova;</HI> but the people would not endure to run the risque of War, but yielded themselves up to Subjection without blow. And in this manner the <HI>Kanou's,</HI> by the aid of the <HI>Folgia's,</HI> became masters of the whole Countrey, and gain'd the reputation of a mighty people.</P>
<P>Soon after he went to the River <HI>Maquelbary,</HI> or <HI>Rio Galinhas,</HI> where he subdu'd the <HI>Quilliga-Monou</HI> after a little resistance; and with them he ended his Wars, and retir'd with his Forces to <HI>Tomby,</HI> his old habitation; but was at length poy∣son'd, as was thought, leaving behind him several sons, which were but little, and not capable to manage their Fathers Dominion.</P>
<P>However the eldest call'd <HI>Flansire</HI> was admitted Successor, during whose Mi∣nority his Uncle <HI>Jemmah,</HI> his Fathers Sisters Son, as Guardian, took care of the Government for some time; but <HI>Flansire</HI> growing in years took the Royal Au∣thority into his own hand, and to shew that he inherited as well his Fathers Valor as Countreys, resolves to enlarge his Bounds yet farther; and to that end went with his Forces over the River <HI>Maquelbary,</HI> or <HI>Galinhas,</HI> taking all the adjacent places as far as <HI>Serre-Lyons,</HI> which he also by force of Arms brought under his Subjection; and in all the chief places before his departure set Garri∣sons, and appointed Governors over them, <HI>viz.</HI> over <HI>Serre-Lyons</HI> he made <HI>Kan∣daqualle</HI> Commander in chief; over the Countreys at the River <HI>de Palm</HI> he set as his Deputy one <HI>Selboele,</HI> from whom the River took name: and to com∣mand the people about <HI>Rio Galinhas,</HI> he appointed one <HI>Sytre.</HI> Having thus set∣led his new Conquests, he return'd into his own native Principality, where he spent a good part of his life in peace and quietness, till inconstant Fortune, which seem'd to have serv'd him too long, began to create him new troubles: For there came news from <HI>Serre-Lyons,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serre-Lions</HI> is taken by <HI>Dego Falmah.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Kandaqualle</HI> was driven out thence, and forced to flie with all his people to the Islands <HI>Bananneo,</HI> not being able to
<PB N="411" REF="259"/>withstand <HI>Dogo Falma,</HI> a native of the Countrey of <HI>Dogo,</HI> a Territory in <HI>Hondo,</HI> who with a mighty force had invaded him. <HI>Flansire</HI> startled at this news, and very well knowing that a matter of such concern required expedition, sent to the <HI>Bolmian</HI> Lords, his Substitutes, to gather their people together, and to meet him at an appointed Rendezvouz: but they had made a private con∣federacy with <HI>Gammina</HI> their Masters brother, by whose instigation they neg∣lected and slighted his Commands.</P>
<P><HI>Flansire</HI> knowing nothing of this Combination between his Brother and his Provincial Governours,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flansire</HI> draws towards <HI>Serre-Lions.</HI></NOTE> after he had committed the Lieutenantship of his Kingdom, and the care of his Wives and Children to the Protection of his Brother, marched forth with his eldest Son <HI>Flamboere,</HI> the present King of <HI>Quoia,</HI> not doubting but that his Provincials durst not have a thought to leave him. First therefore he went by Land to the River <HI>Galinhas,</HI> and from thence with <HI>Canoos</HI> over the Islands <HI>Banannes,</HI> to take with him the People that were driven from <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> as we lately mention'd, and so passed directly to <HI>Serre-Lions;</HI> where Landing with his Forces,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He comes with his Forces to Land.</NOTE> he began a sharp War with <HI>Dogo Falma.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Dogo Falma</HI> had been heretofore a great Man in favour with the King of <HI>Dogo,</HI> or <HI>Hondo,</HI> but had attempted, and lay with one of the King's Wives;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dogo Falmab</HI> punish'd by the King of <HI>Hondo.</HI></NOTE> whereat the King was so enraged, that not contented the offence, according to custom, should be bought off with Gifts or Slaves, he caused his Ears to be cut off, and banished him his Presence: but length of time so wore out the King's fury, that <HI>Dogo Falma</HI> was admitted again to the Court; where he had not long been but he began to shew his insolence,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Speech to the King upon his having punishment</NOTE> and at length accosted the King in these terms: <HI>Sir King, considering the wickedness committed against you my Lord and Master, I am obliged to thank you for your gracious Sentence by which I am punished, that every one that looks upon me derides and scorns me; and the rather, because the punishment is unusual, and the like offence customarily bought off with Goods and Slaves: Now as you were pleased to punish me, so I desire the like offence in others may be punished in the same manner. It may happen that some of the King's Servants or Subjects may fall into the same Lapse: but if it be either deni'd, or not performed, I shall complain against my Lord the King in the Ways and in the Woods, to the</HI> Jannanen <HI>and</HI> Belli, that is, to all the Spirits and Daemons.</P>
<P>The King having heard this audacious Speech, took council upon it; and, notwithstanding his implicite menace, determin'd, that the punishment inflict∣ed on him should not follow upon all: But nevertheless to pacifie him in some measure, and take off his complaint, he made him General of an Army,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is made General of <HI>Serre-Lions.</HI></NOTE> to recover <HI>Serre-Lyons</HI> out of the hands of <HI>Kandaqualla,</HI> who presided there for <HI>Flamboere.</HI></P>
<P>To repel this Invader, <HI>Flansire,</HI> as we said, was come to <HI>Serre-Lyons</HI> with an Army, and made sharp War; at length by the help of some <HI>Whites,</HI> he fell upon the Town <HI>Falmaha,</HI> and with axes cutting down the Tree-wall; at last they forc'd an Entrance, and set the Houses on fire,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town of <HI>Falmah</HI> is taken and burnt.</NOTE> whose fury soon increased to an impossibility of being quenched. Whereupon <HI>Dogo Falmah</HI> finding himself unable to resist, fled; whom King <HI>Flamboere</HI> with the <HI>Karou's</HI> pursu'd, though to no purpose: however <HI>Flamboere</HI> won great reputation at this time, for his va∣lour, the people crying him up in these terms, <HI>Dogo Falmah, Jondo Moo,</HI> that is, Pursuer of <HI>Dogo Falmah.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Flansire</HI> reconquer'd <HI>Bolmberre,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gammanah</HI> stands up a∣gainst <HI>Flansire.</HI></NOTE> and settl'd <HI>Kandaqualla</HI> again in his Lieu∣tenantship, and then Retreated with his Company, intending to return to

But on the way he receiv'd notice that his Brother <HI>Gammanah,</HI> whom he had given Commission to manage the State and supervise his Family in his absence, had usurp'd his Dominion, and kill'd all his Sons he could come at, and taken his Wives to himself, and set up his Residence by <HI>Rio de Galinhas,</HI> as a convenient place to intercept or impede his Brothers return: And as commonly, <HI>fluctus fluctum sequitur,</HI> one trouble falls in the neck of another; so here, this Rebellion of his Brother was attended with an In∣vasion of the <HI>Gebbe-Monou</HI> who dwell about <HI>Cabo Mesurado,</HI> who fell into <HI>Do∣wala</HI> and <HI>Cape de Monte,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gebbe-Monou</HI>'s fall upon <HI>Dowala.</HI></NOTE> where they burnt the Town, and lead away Prisoners all persons they could meet with, intending to make them Slaves.</P>
<P><HI>Flansire</HI> understanding these mischiefs, marched towards the River <HI>Maqual∣bary</HI> with all speed; but complaining to the <HI>Kanon</HI> and <HI>Jananie's,</HI> that is, to God and the Angels, of his distress in these words, <HI>To you onely it is known, that my Father left me rightful Heir in his Kingdom, which falls to me by the Laws of the Land, seeing I was the Eldest Son, and that my Brother hath rebelled against me, and hath set himself up to be Lord: be you Judges between him and me in this intended Fight, and let it, if the Cause be unjust that he manages against me, come upon his own head.</HI></P>
<P>Thereupon he passed with all his Souldiers over the River, where the Ar∣mies suddenly met, and his Brother, with great number of his men, slain, he got a compleat Victory; but still kept the Field, although no further opposi∣tion appeared against him.</P>
<P>In this time, while the King remain'd encamp'd in the Field, to be the more ready against any other appearing Rebels, his Son <HI>Flamboere</HI> went with a Squadron of Souldiers into the Woods to hunt Civet-Cats; and by his Sports trained far into them, they discover'd some of the Rebels busie in burying the dead body of the Usurper; but as they perceiv'd <HI>Flamboere</HI> and his followers, immediately they betook themselves to flight, imagining he had purposely come with that Force to find them out, and left the Corps behind them, with three Shackell'd Slaves, intended to have been dispatch'd at his Grave accord∣ing to custom. By this means ascertain'd of <HI>Gammanah's</HI> death, when they least expected it, they took and brought the three Slaves to <HI>Flansire,</HI> who having un∣derstood out of their mouthes all circums tances of what had happen'd, and how all things stood in the Countrey, he sent them to their fellow-Rebels, to admonish them to come to him to ask him pardon, and to assure them, that he would not think of their misdeeds: Which goodness of the Kings, though pre∣sented by the mouth of these Slaves, wrought the desir'd effect, for the Rebels immediately submitted, and receiv'd their pardon.</P>

<P>Divers Geographers make this whole Coast one Kingdom,

<P>Three miles up this Water stands the <HI>King's Village,</HI> where commonly the Ships lie at an Anchor to Trade.</P>
<P>A mile and a half Eastward you come to <HI>Little Sestos,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little <HI>Sestos.</HI></NOTE> a Village, neighbor'd by a Cliff extending into the Sea, and having one Tree upon it as a Land-Mark.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabo Baixos.</NOTE> that is, <HI>Dry Head,</HI> by reason of the Shelf lying before it in the Sea. It is a round Hill, a mile and a half from the Main Land.</P>
<P>Eastward of <HI>Cabo Baixos</HI> you may see a white Rock, appearing far off coming by Sea out of the South, like a Ship with a Sail. And farther into the Sea many others, which threaten great danger to the ignorant Sea-man; and the rather, because most of them are cover'd with Water.</P>
<P>Three miles from hence the Village <HI>Zanwyn</HI> shews it self,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zanwyn.</NOTE> with a River of the same Name; on whose Banks stands a great Wood, where are many tall and lofty Trees.</P>
<P>A mile Easterly lies the Hamlet <HI>Bofow;</HI> and half a mile thence <HI>Little Setter:</HI> distant from which three miles you may view the Village <HI>Bottowa,</HI> seated on the rising of a high Land near the Sea-Coast, opposite to <HI>Cape Swine;</HI> and to the Southward, a Village of the same Name, by a small Rivers side.</P>
<P>Four miles more Eastward you discover the little Town <HI>Sabrebon,</HI> or <HI>Souwe∣robo;</HI> then to a place named <HI>Krow,</HI> which directs you presently to a promi∣nent Cape with three black Points. From <HI>Bottowa</HI> the Coast reaches South-East and by East for five miles, with low and uniform Land, little known to Sea-men, onely before <HI>Setter</HI> and <HI>Krow</HI> some high and bare Trees raise them∣selves into the Air like Masts of Ships laid up.</P>
<P>Passing four or five miles from <HI>Krow</HI> you come to a Village call'd <HI>Wappen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wappen.</NOTE> or <HI>Wabbo,</HI> in a Valley, with a Stream of fresh Water adjoining, and five or six streight Trees on the East-side.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Wappen</HI> lieth an Island, and by it the greatest Cliff in all this Coast, besides many smaller; and farther on the right hand another Cliff, uni∣ted on the East with the Land; at whose Edge lieth a Pond, whereinto the fresh Water falls out of the Woods. Hither the Sea-men bring their Casks commonly into the Village; which the <HI>Blacks</HI> fill with Water, receiving for their pains Cotton-Seed, or Beads. The like Pond is by <HI>Krow,</HI> behind the Cliffs: whither also the Sea-men commonly go with their Boats to fetch fresh Water; which the <HI>Blacks</HI> bring them in Pots out of the Woods, and re∣ceive the like reward.</P>
<PB N="415" REF="261"/>
<P>From <HI>Wappen</HI> you come next to <HI>Drowya,</HI> thence to <HI>Great Setter,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Setter.</NOTE> by the <HI>French</HI> call'd <HI>Parys;</HI> adjoyning to which rises a large Pool of fresh water.

From hence all Ships that arrive there, plentifully furnish themselves both with fresh Water and Wood.</P>
<P>Next in order comes the high Point, <HI>Cabo das Palmas,</HI> or <HI>Cape Palm,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape de Palm.</NOTE> in four Degrees, and fifteen Minutes North Latitude; on whose Westerly Corner are three round Hills; and a little farther within Land, a round Grove of Palm-Trees, which may be seen far at Sea, from whence this Point took the Name of <HI>Cabo das Palmas.</HI></P>
<P>Near to this, in <HI>Sandy-Bay</HI> arriving Ships finde a convenient Harbour: A mile Easterly of which up into the Countrey, appears a long Mountain, look∣ing like double Land: From the first Point of <HI>Palm Cape,</HI> a ledge of Rocks shoot South South-East, a mile into the Sea; and before them a great Shelf two miles long; between them the Tide runs very strong to the East, having ten or eleven fathom Water: Two miles more Eastward,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gruway.</NOTE> the Village <HI>Gru∣way</HI> stands seated at the end of the <HI>Grain-Coast.</HI></P>
<P>This whole Shore is very full of Rocks; for which reason, the Ships which Ride there, are in no little danger.</P>
<P>In <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> here is fair and clear Weather, with cooling Breezes, and gentle Westerly Winds.</P>
<P>In the middle of <HI>May</HI> there begin South and South-East Winds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air.</NOTE> which bring with them not onely stormy Gusts, as <HI>Hericanes,</HI> but also Thunder, Lightning, and great Rains, that continue <HI>June, July, August, September, October, November, December,</HI> and to the latter end of <HI>January:</HI> During part of this time, the Sun being in the <HI>Zenith,</HI> or Vertical Point of the Heavens, sends down its Beams perpendicular.</P>
<P>The Land here yields great plenty of <HI>Mille,</HI> Cotton, Rice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grain of Paradise, or <HI>Melegette.</HI></NOTE> good <HI>Palmeto</HI>-Wine, besides divers sorts of Grain, especially that call'd of <HI>Paradise,</HI> or <HI>Me∣legette.</HI></P>
<P>The Plant that bears <HI>Melegette</HI> hath thick Leaves, better than three inches long, and three broad, with a thick rib in the middle, out of which shoot many Veins, which have a Spicie-taste like those of the Seed.</P>
<P>The Fruit is but little of size, cover'd with a poisonous, tough, Russet-co∣lour'd, or rather Pale-brown Shell, and under that a Film fill'd with many smooth and pointed small Seeds, white within, biting as Pepper and Ginger.</P>
<P>The unripe Grains are red, and pleasant in taste.</P>
<P>The greatest, smoothest, and Chess-nut-colour'd, are the best; and the blackest the worst.</P>
<P>No kind of Beasts are here wanting, by which means there is all necessary Provision to be had for Seamen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blacks</HI> in these Parts are very envious to all Strangers,

<P>and about half flood a fathom and a half deep, but within very dry and nar∣row, that it gives little advantage either to the Natives or Seamen.</P>
<P>At the West-side of it rises a Rocky and steep Hill, full of Brambles and Trees; but on the East-side a Sandy Bank, by which as it were split, it runs in two small Vills, one to the North-west into the Countrey, and the other North-east; but (as we said) both dry and not Navigable.</P>
<P>Near <HI>St. Andrew's</HI> River, the Sea-Coast bellies out to the South-east, as far as the Red-Land.</P>
<P>Between the fourth and fifth Cliff, some high Trees grow in a Valley, whose edge is remarked with two little Vills, the one named <HI>Tabattera,</HI> the other <HI>Domera.</HI></P>
<P>Having left behind you the Red Cliffs, you come to <HI>Cape La-Hou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape de Labou.</NOTE> the ut∣most limit of this, and the beginning of <HI>Quaqua-Coast,</HI> which spreads it self to <HI>Assine:</HI> the whole Land hereabouts low and poor, over-grown with Bram∣bles and Trees, yet a mile and a half Eastwards lyeth a Village call'd <HI>Koutrou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Koutrou.</NOTE> or <HI>Katrou.</HI></P>
<P>Five miles from this <HI>Cape,</HI> stands the Village <HI>Jakke La-Hou,</HI> in a very barren spot: five miles farther <HI>Jak</HI> in <HI>Jakko;</HI> and six miles beyond that, the <HI>Bottomless∣pit,</HI> so call'd from its unfathomable deepness; for the Seamen having Sounded with their longest Lines and Plummet, could never reach the bottom. This Hole is in the Sea, not above a Musquet-shot from the Shore, so that the Ships which come about this Pit, must come to an Anchor betimes to prevent danger.</P>
<P>Three miles from this Pit on the Shore, runs a small River Eastward into the Countrey.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cape de La-Hou</HI> to the aforesaid Pit, the Coast spreads Eastwardly with double Land.</P>
<P>Sixteen miles Eastward, <HI>bi La-Hou</HI> takes place,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corbi Labou.</NOTE> before which the Sea runs very deep, for a stones cast from the Shore it has forty and fifty Fathom water.</P>
<P>Eight and twenty or thirty miles from the <HI>Cape La-Hou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assine.</NOTE> is seated the Village <HI>Assine,</HI> where the <HI>Guinny</HI>-Gold-Coast begins, full of high Woods, but the Land low; the houses (such as they are) stand on the Sea-shore, so that they may easily be seen in the passing by.</P>
<P>Two miles from <HI>Assine</HI> stands a Hamlet call'd <HI>Abbener</HI> or <HI>Albine,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Albine.</NOTE> a little to the West of a four-square Wood.</P>
<P>Then follows in order <HI>Taboe;</HI> and two miles farther <HI>Cape Apolony,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Taboe.</NOTE> being a ri∣sing ground, and seeming to Sailers like three great Hills.</P>
<P>In <HI>Jernon,</HI> a little Village scituate on the side of this Promontory, the <HI>Nether∣landers</HI> have a Storehouse.</P>
<P>All along this whole Coast grow many Palm-Trees: nor is it destitute of other Conveniences, yielding extraordinary variety both of Fruits and Plants.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants, as we mention'd before, are call'd <HI>Quaqua's,</HI> because when they see any Trading-Ships approach, they declare their welcome by crying aloud <HI>Quaqua.</HI></P>
<P>These People by their Aspect seem the unseemliest of all the upper Coast; but are indeed the modestest and honestest, and most courteous; for they esteem it a great shame, either at meeting to Salute, or at parting to take leave with a Kiss. When they come to the Ships to Trade, they put their Hands in the
<PB N="418" REF="264"/>Water, and let some drop into their Eyes; by which they testifie, as by an Oath, their uprightness, and hatred to all Cheatings, or Knavish actions.</P>
<P>Drunkenness they not onely abstain from,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They shun Drunkenness.</NOTE> but abominate: for the avoiding which they will drink no <HI>Palmito</HI>-Wine, but a smaller sort call'd <HI>De Bordon,</HI> or <HI>Tombe,</HI> and that also mixt with Water; alledging, that from Drunkenness pro∣ceed many Quarrels, the two frequent occasions of Murders, and other incon∣veniencies; which are all prevented by Sobriety and Temperance.</P>
<P>The chief Merchandise to be had here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchandise.</NOTE> are Elephants-Teeth, of a larger size than usually elsewhere; but withall dearer. Some Cloathes also sold here; which the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and other Traders, from the Name of the Coast, call <HI>Quaqua-Cloathes;</HI> being of two sorts, the one bound with five Bands, or Strings; the other with six: from the number of the bindings giving denominations to the Places they are sold in.</P>
<P><HI>Cape Lahou</HI> yields many of these Clothes, which the Inhabitants barter for Salt; which they, according to their own report send abroad by Slaves or otherwise, who with it travel so far into the Countrey, till they come to white People, that Ride on Mules and Asses, and use Lances for Arms; but they are not altoge∣ther white, as the <HI>Europeans.</HI> By this Description we cannot but imagine, these Mungrel <HI>Whites</HI> they mention, must without peradventure be <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Blacks</HI> of other Places exchange these Cloathes for yellow Arm-Rings, and sometimes, but seldom, for Beads. Heretofore some Gold was to be had; but now that Trade is lost here, and carried to <HI>Akara.</HI></P>
<P>The Government here is Monarchical,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> the present Regnant King call'd <HI>Sakkoo;</HI> of whom all the neighboring Territories stand in great fear, because he is a Conjurer, firmly believing, that if he pleased to put his Arts in practise, he could bewitch all his Enemies to death.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>December</HI> this <HI>Sakkoo</HI> sends a <HI>Canoo</HI> to <HI>Atzyn</HI> and <HI>Little Kommany,</HI> and all places on the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> with <HI>Negro's;</HI> where they throw some compounded Conjuring-stuff into the Sea, using some formal words in doing it; which is done onely to free it from Hericanes, or Whirlwinds, and tempe∣stuous Storms. So soon as this <HI>Canoo</HI> returns, the Merchants come with their Cloathes to the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> but in such order, that no more may come off till the first come back, for the prevention of the hinderances of one another. The five Band Villages have the priority in coming off, and after those of the six Band: this continues till <HI>April,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>May:</HI> when the Sea begins to run high, then the King's <HI>Canoo</HI> comes as before, using the same formality, and returning, the <HI>Gold-Coast</HI> Trade ends for that Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quaqua-Blacks</HI> have a well-govern'd State according to their Mode: As for example, those that are Fishers must all so remain, without daring to alter their Employment: As likewise all Merchants are so preferred there, that no other may deal in fair Laces, and Garments of <HI>Akori,</HI> but they; insomuch that all others who have those Commodities, are necessitated to put them into the Merchants hands.</P>
<P>The method of their Worship,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion</NOTE> if any, is Diabolical, sacrificing Men to their Idols, and thereto so addicted, that they will not be won to alter it; yet cour∣teous enough to Strangers, from whom they endeavour to conceal those ab∣horr'd Oblations.</P>

<P>Three miles lower stands a large Town, call'd <HI>Sama,</HI> containing about two hundred Houses, under the Government of one <HI>Braffo;</HI> nevertheless both he and his men own as their Superior Lord the King of <HI>Gavi,</HI> whom they serve in his Wars in time of need, and pay him Tribute.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugeuese</HI> had in this Village a Stone Bulwark, with a Store-house, but now decay'd, and deserted by them; but by reason of the great conveniency of the River for fresh water, and the adjacent Grounds for Fire-wood, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> have Rebuilt and possess it, and have rais'd the middle foursquare Battery fourteen Foot high, and a Store-house, whither those of <HI>Adom</HI> and <HI>Was∣sen</HI> come to Traffick with them.</P>
<P>Close under the Town runs a handsome River, whose Water is fresh and pleasant. Two, three or four miles upwards, but higher up, is full of Cliffs and Rocks, so that it is not passable, although for a while it was conceited otherwise, till experience manifested the contrary; for several of the Traders there hoping to have got some advantage by it in their Gold-trade, sent six persons in a Ketch, with three weeks Provision to search, who turn'd back the thirteenth day, relating that they had Row'd up eleven or twelve days, but were not able to get any further, because of the forcible fall of the Water six or seven Foot higher; and that above, they discover'd so many Cliffs and Rocks, that it was impossible to get through them.</P>
<P><HI>Anten</HI> is a plentiful Countrey, producing great store of Fowl,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Condition of the Countrey.</NOTE> and Poultry of several sorts; besides great variety of Fruits and Vegetables, especially <HI>Injame's, Ananasse's,</HI> and <HI>Palmitor's,</HI> from which so much Palm-wine is extracted, that the <HI>Blacks</HI> come ten or twenty miles to fetch it thence in <HI>Canoo's,</HI> and carry it up the whole <HI>Gold-Coast.</HI></P>

<P>They have always held themselves in an indifferent neutrality towards all people,

<P>The best Conveniences to be had among them, are Water, Wood, and Ballast for Ships.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kingdom of <HI>Guaffo.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Commany,</HI> borders in the West on <HI>Anten</HI> and <HI>Tabeu,</HI> having a small River for a Boundary, between both; in the North-West, on <HI>Adom;</HI> in the North, on <HI>Abramboe;</HI> in the East, on <HI>Fetu;</HI> and in the South, on the Sea.</P>
<P>Formerly <HI>Commendo, Fetu,</HI> and <HI>Sabou,</HI> were united under one Prince, and the Inhabitants then, as now by strangers, call'd <HI>Adossenie's;</HI> as those of <HI>Fantijn, Fan∣tenie's;</HI> but at present divided into three several Kingdoms.</P>
<P>On the Shore lie several Towns, as <HI>Aitako,</HI> or <HI>Agitaki,</HI> otherwise <HI>Little-Com∣mendo,</HI> but by the <HI>Portugal's</HI> call'd <HI>Aldea de Torres,</HI> being the head Town on the Shore, scituate on the Borders of <HI>Fetu,</HI> two miles and an half Eastward of <HI>Sa∣ma;</HI> then <HI>Ampea,</HI> or <HI>Apene, Cotabry, Aborby, Terra Pekine;</HI> and half a mile East∣ward another <HI>Commendo.</HI></P>
<P>Within the Countrey, stands a great City upon a Mountain, by the Inhabi∣tants stil'd <HI>Guaffo;</HI> and by the <HI>Europeans, Great-Commendo,</HI> for a distinction from <HI>Little-Commendo</HI> before-mention'd, lying near the Sea.</P>
<P>Most of those Towns have suffered terrible devastations by those of the <HI>Myne,</HI> who use on a sudden to invade them by Water, burning and spoiling all before them, being not able to cope with the <HI>Guaffin's</HI> at Land: but they of <HI>Abramboe</HI> once made War against this Countrey by Land, got the Victory, and kill'd their King.</P>
<P>All sorts of Fruit and Provision are daily brought to Market in abundance by those of <HI>Guaffo,</HI>

<P>This is certainly the chiefest place of Trade next <HI>Myne</HI> and <HI>Moure,</HI> being much frequented: Yet the Inhabitants maintain themselves by Fishing, fur∣nishing from their Stores and Labours all the Neighboring Countreys.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this Town, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> have a Fort,

<HEAD>The Castle of the Myne, or St. George.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Castle of the Myne,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle of the <HI>Myne.</HI> Gold-Mines lying near.</NOTE> generally so call'd because of the adjacent Gold-Mines; but by the <HI>Portugals, St. George;</HI> to whose Protection they dedica∣ted the same: It stands upon the Borders of <HI>Fetu,</HI> near the Sea-shore, in a small Nook or Creek of the Salt River <HI>Benja,</HI> two miles from <HI>Little Commendo.</HI></P>
<P>This Castle was judg'd an antient Building,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Antiquity.</NOTE> from several marks of Antiqui∣ty about it; as first by a decay'd Battery, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> repaired some years ago, retaining the Name of <HI>The French Battery,</HI> because it seems to have been built by the <HI>French;</HI> who, as the Inhabitants say, before the coming of the <HI>Por∣tugals,</HI> harbour'd there. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> when they won it, found the Numerical Figures of the Year Thirteen hundred, but were not able to make any thing of the two following Characters. In a small place within also may be seen a Writing Carved in Stone between two old Pillars, but so impair'd and worn out by the Weather, that it is not legible: The next is the Magazine, which seems first to have been built in the Year Fourteen hundred eighty four, in the Reign of <HI>John</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> as appears by Figures of the Year upon the Gate, standing yet so clear and plain, as if made but a few years before.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Form.</NOTE> The Building consists of hard Stone in double rows, between which the vacancies fill'd with Earth, scituate for the most part upon a high Rock; against which on one side the Sea beats, so that it is difficult to be as∣saulted; on the other side inclosed with four strong Bulwarks, two on the Sea-Coast, which are the strongest, and other two on the Land-side. The Walls are but low towards the Sea, because the Flankers built about it are very high; but to the Landward the Walls are lofty and strong for defence. It is in the narrowest part fourteen Rods broad, and two and thirty Rods long, besides the Out-works reaching from the River to the Banks of the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> took it from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty seven; at which time it had towards the Sea two Batteries, each strengthen'd with six good Pieces of Ordnance, whereas towards the Land, opposite to the Mountain <HI>St. Jago:</HI> where the greatest strength was required they had but one Battery, with six Mortar-Pieces; and toward the North-East but two small Pieces upon an old Barracado'd Gate.</P>
<P>Over against the Castle on the West,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mountain St. <HI>Jago.</HI></NOTE> beyond the River, lieth the Mountain <HI>St. Jago,</HI> so call'd from a little Chappel, formerly erected there; upon which the <HI>Dutch</HI> made a Redoubt of Earth immediately after the taking it, to hinder the approaching and coming up of an Enemy to the Mountain. This new Sconce holds four and twenty Rods square, and twelve Foot in heighth, en∣compassed with a Stone Wall.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Mount St. Jago</HI> lieth another of the like heighth, from whence onely <HI>St. Jago</HI> can receive damage, the rest lying at greater distance, and much lower.</P>
<P>Over against <HI>St. Jago,</HI> in the place where, in the time of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> stood two Lodges, is now raised a Battery, Planted with great Guns, the better to defend the Fort against <HI>St. Jago's Hill.</HI></P>
<P>On this Quarter the Castle was very weak while the <HI>Portugals</HI> held it, be∣ing without Breast-works, and scarce Fenced with a Mud-Wall: onely there
<PB N="425" REF="267"/>stood a Battery with six Mortar-Pieces, and two small Pieces upon an old Gate, as we mention'd before: But on the Sea-quarter they made it strongest, and Planted their chiefest and best Guns: for they were of opinion, that no Cannon could be got up the Mountain <HI>St. Jago,</HI> and therefore took so little care thereof, that they had suffer'd the Mountain to be over-grown with Bushes, supposing that the Trees alone would be a sufficient hinderance to any Enemy; but they found themselves greatly mistaken therein; though indeed otherwise this Fort, by the strong Walls, and great heighth, hath sufficient Defence.</P>
<P>In this Castle rises a fair Fountain of Water,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fountains of Water.</NOTE> and in the <HI>French</HI>-Battery ano∣ther; in both which may be kept Provision of Water for two hundred men for six moneths. Besides those Fountains there is a Trench over against the Town <HI>Myne,</HI> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Dana,</HI> cut out of the Rocks, being enough to contain a thousand Pipes or more, whereinto all the waste water falling from the two beforemention'd places, and from the Souldiers Courts of Guard, ga∣thereth together.</P>
<P>This Trench without doubt, cost the <HI>Portugals</HI> a very tedious and heavy labour.</P>
<P>By this water drawn from hence, the Inhabitants are furnish'd; as also the King of <HI>Fetu</HI> with his Army, when in War, supply'd, and now accommodates the <HI>Dutch</HI> with marvellous plenty.</P>
<P>The conveniencies for Merchandise, Provision of Food, necessary Ammu∣nition for Wars, and other Commodities, are in great abundance within this Fort; for that the Ships coming out of the Countrey, readily unload, and go back again; there being a Key for Landing or Shipping of all sorts of Com∣modities at a Water-Gate made for that purpose.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> suffer'd great prejudice so long as the <HI>Portugal's</HI> possess'd this Fort, because they endeavour'd by all means to hinder their Trade with the <HI>Blacks;</HI> whereupon they consulted, and design'd to get it from them, yet always were frustrated in their attempts, till the year Sixteen hundred thirty and seven; at which time the Castle was in a mean condition, by reason of great disagree∣ment among the <HI>Portugal's:</HI> Then the General of <HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>Angola</HI> being ac∣quainted by the <HI>Kaboseroe's</HI> or Chief people of the <HI>Myne,</HI> that the time was to undertake somewhat about it. This Intelligence he communicated by Let∣ter to the Commissioners of the <HI>West-India</HI> Company, who provided nine Ships well Man'd, Arm'd, and Victual'd, which in the Year Sixteen hun∣dred thirty seven, the Five and twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> under Collonel <HI>Hans Koin,</HI> went forth from <HI>Farnambuck</HI> to the <HI>African</HI> Coast, and soon arriv'd there in safety; whereof he sent notice to General <HI>Yperen,</HI> who resided in the Town <HI>Moure</HI> two miles lower, by Letter, to this effect: <HI>That he was there, by Command of</HI> Grave Maurice, <HI>and the Council, furnish'd with Souldiers to undertake the Enter∣prise. He desir'd therefore to know where was a fit place to Land upon the Ene∣mies Quarters, and to advise with him in what manner the Enterprise might be pru∣dently accomplish'd: That he would endeavour to win the</HI> Blacks <HI>with all possible Perswasions, great Promises, and Rewards, to assist the Company; and withal, would watch the</HI> English, <HI>who lay upon the Road, and labour to prevent all other Impe∣diments; That they must keep all secret, that the Enterprise might not be disappointed: and in the interim, he would be upon the Road before</HI> Albine, <HI>or</HI> Assine, <HI>to expect an Answer.</HI></P>
<P>While thus <HI>Koyn</HI> ply'd upon the Coast, the <HI>Negroes</HI> come with eigh∣teen
<PB N="426" REF="268"/><HI>Canoo's</HI> to his Fleet, and ask for <HI>Netherlandish</HI> Merchandise, to barter for Elephants-Teeth: But when 'twas answer'd they had no Wares, the <HI>Blacks</HI> be∣gan greatly to doubt; but the <HI>Dutch</HI> to assure them friendship, according to the custom of the Countrey, let some drops of Sea-water fall into their eyes, where∣with for the present satisfi'd, they departed. At length the Fleet appearing before <HI>Albine</HI> and <HI>Assine,</HI> the <HI>Blacks</HI> came again with their <HI>Canoo's</HI> to Trade, but our men put them off with delays for three or four days; whereupon the <HI>Blacks</HI> said, that these of <HI>Fetisson</HI> had understood by their Guardian <HI>God,</HI> that seven big∣ger Ships were at hand, at whose coming their Wares would fall in Price. <HI>Koin,</HI> who little regarded that, and had somewhat else in his mind, wrote Letters again almost of the same Contents, whereto for answer he receiv'd Orders to remove with his Fleet before <HI>Commendo,</HI> which was speedily perform'd; and imme∣diately inquiry made for the fittest place to Land; to this purpose they sent out a Scout, who returning, brought intelligence that there was no Landing between the <HI>Myne</HI> and <HI>Cape de Kors,</HI> but onely a Musquet-shot from the <HI>Myne,</HI> where the Salt-River at low Water was not knee deep, that the Mountain of <HI>St. Jago</HI> might be easily attempted with small Shot, and that the Line was un∣fit to be long defended: That the fresh River which lay about half a mile from the <HI>Myne</HI> had excellent Water, and that the way from <HI>Cape de Kors</HI> to the <HI>Myne,</HI> was very fit to March on in good order with the Souldiers.</P>
<P>After much courting, at length, and opening to them their whole design, they gat the Youths of <HI>Commendo</HI> with Gifts, and promises to furnish them with Water and other Provision; whereupon on the Four and twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> they went off to <HI>Cape de Kors,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They land at <HI>Cape de Kors.</HI></NOTE> and there Landed with great <HI>Canoo's;</HI> and on the Twenty fifth day being Tuesday, drew in good order to the <HI>Myne,</HI> being about eight hundred Land-Souldiers, and Five hundred Mariners, drawn up in three Companies. Coming about Noon to the fresh River, the Souldiers rested and refresh'd themselves, some Scouts were sent for discovery, who brought intelligence, that they discern'd about a thousand <HI>Blacks</HI> lye at the hanging of a Hill; who having discover'd, pursu'd them with a great cry; upon this were sent out four Musquetteers, who venturing too far were lost, and their heads by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> according to the manner of the Countrey cut off, and carried in triumph. But a greater force falling in, soon put them to flight, and possess'd the Hill whence the other were driven.</P>
<P>On Wednesday the six and twentieth, those of <HI>Commendo</HI> drew our Mariners to the Town of <HI>Myne,</HI> which they assaulted, and took all their Cattel.</P>
<P>The Commander in Chief bending his whole thoughts to take the Castle, caus'd in this interval two Passages to be made, by cutting up the Bushes on the Mountain <HI>St. Jago;</HI> the one leading towards the Shore, by which to bring the Ammunition for the Souldiers; and the other upon the top of the Moun∣tain near the Fort. On Thursday were brought two Pieces of Ordnance with a Mortar-Piece to <HI>Mount St. Jago,</HI> with which they made eight or ten Shot, besides as many Granadoes, but they fell short; whereas by the shooting of the Enemy from the Castle, two Centinels were kill'd. Then the <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Commendo</HI> approached towards the Town of <HI>Myne;</HI> but driven back by the Enemies great Shot,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle Summon'd.</NOTE> quickly retreated: Hereupon the Commander sent a Drummer to summon the besieg'd to surrender; to which the Governor re∣turn'd, That it was not in his power to consent, without conferring with the Commanders of the Army, and the Citizens, and requir'd three days time; but that was deni'd, granting onely to the next day; however nothing was
<PB N="427" REF="268"/>then done; for the Governor of the Fort, the day being spent, held the Gates shut, and would not admit the Drummer: Then the Forces from <HI>Mount St. Jago</HI> making a fierce Attacque, though with little Success; and battering with their Cannon, a Messenger came forth, requiring the Letter sent before by the Drummer; but that was deni'd: Whereupon after a short Consultation, Messengers were sent to treat of an Agreement; during which Treaty, the <HI>Blacks</HI> of <HI>Commendo</HI> were requir'd to lay down Arms, and to use no force to the Husbandmen of the <HI>Myne.</HI></P>
<P>The Articles offer'd by the Garrison, were refus'd;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of Agreement.</NOTE> but those accepted that the Beleaguerers propos'd; being to this effect: They shall all with their Wives and Children, without reproach or abuse, go forth safe with Life and Limb. Every one shall take their Apparel; but no Money either Gold or Silver. The Victor shall retain all the Merchandise, and Slaves, except twelve, which the owners may keep. All the Church-Ornaments and Utensils, except of Gold and Silver, they shall take away with them. The <HI>Portugals, Mulattoes,</HI> and all their Housholds provided with necessary Sustenance, shall be carried to the Island <HI>St. Thome.</HI> The Governor of the Fort, and Souldiers, shall forthwith depart out of the Fort, and leave all the Ammunition for War, and the rest of the Merchandise to the Victor. The Souldiers shall depart without Co∣lours or Sword, and neither have lighted Match nor Bullets. Thus was this renowned Castle won and lost in four days.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Booty.</NOTE> The Booty of Ammunition and Arms found therein, were thirty Iron Pieces of Ordnance, nine thousand weight of Spice, eight hundred great Iron Balls, ten Fats of small Bullets, and three hundred Stone Bullets, six and thirty <HI>Spanish</HI> Swords, besides Bowes, Ar∣rows, and other Utensils of War. As soon as the Garrison was drawn out, and come over to the Island <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> took possession with an hun∣dred and forty Men. A former attempt had been made against this Castle, but succeeded unluckily; the manner this:</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral with his Fleet, on the six and twentieth of <HI>August,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruitless attempt up∣on the Castle of <HI>Myne.</HI></NOTE> One thousand six hundred twenty five, came into <HI>Serre-Lions</HI> to refresh his Men, being most of them sick of the Bloody-Flux; where he found three other Ships, who had lay'n there two Moneths, undergoing great Misery, Sickness, and other Calamities. The People of both the Parties being refreshed and cured, determined to win the Castle of <HI>Myne,</HI> being about fifteen Ships and Ketches, with which they set forth the five and twentieth of <HI>September</HI> from <HI>Serre-Lions,</HI> and were the ninth of <HI>October</HI> upon the <HI>Grain-Coast,</HI> between <HI>Rio St. Paulo,</HI> and <HI>Rio Junk,</HI> in five Degrees and an half North Latitude, where they sent a Ketch to the General for the <HI>Netherlands West-India</HI> Company at <HI>Moure,</HI> to acquaint him with their coming, and that they intended to come with their Fleet before <HI>Kommony,</HI> and to Land there.</P>
<P>Being come on the twentieth of the same Moneth before <HI>Kommony,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The coming to <HI>Kommany.</HI></NOTE> they understood that the General was gone to <HI>Akra,</HI> the uttermost place of the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> and not expected back again for three or four days. This delay the Admiral and his Council of War thought would give too fair opportunity to the Enemy, and therefore resolved to Land the Soldiers: but this resolution was deferr'd by advice of those of the Fort of <HI>Nassau,</HI> till the coming of the General, because of his great Interest with the Kings of <HI>Fetu, Sabou,</HI> and <HI>Kom∣mony,</HI> in whose Favour much did consist. But immediately after his arrival, which was on the four and twentieth, it was concluded the next day to go on with the Design. Four Ships therefore were order'd to lie close before
<PB N="428" REF="269"/>the Castle of the <HI>Myne,</HI> to amuse the Enemy by continual Shooting for three days,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They Land at <HI>Terra Pe∣kine.</HI></NOTE> till the other Soldiers might in the mean time draw up without inter∣ruption. The five and twentieth they Land in <HI>Terra Pekine</HI> about twelve hun∣dred Soldiers and Mariners, with an hundred and fifteen <HI>Blacks</HI> brought from <HI>Maure</HI> with the General; who about Noon came within a mile of the Castle of <HI>Myne,</HI> and from thence, after two hours rest, drew within shot of it; where they were saluted presently with some great Guns, but without hurt: and so sate down before the Castle behind a Hill, with resolution that night to En∣trench and make their Approaches. In the mean time, while the General went to the pitch of the Hill to view the Castle, the Soldiers being tir'd with heat and thirst, ran from their Arms, and gat themselves to rest, without suspicion of any Enemy;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Were fallen upon by the Enemy.</NOTE> but as soon as the Commanders were come upon the top of the Mountain, they were unawares fall'n upon by about two hundred <HI>Blacks,</HI> who, like mad furious Men, fell in and made great slaughter and destruction amongst them; which bred such a terrour and consternation amongst them, that they threw away their Arms, and leaping into the Water were drown'd. There remained slain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of the slain.</NOTE> together with those that were drown'd, three hundred seventy three Soldiers, sixty six Mariners, and most of the superior and infe∣rior Officers;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The General wounded.</NOTE> the General himself wounded, came to extream distress, and carried out of the Fight, the rest fled to <HI>Kommany;</HI> whither also the Ships steer∣ed their course: and by this means was that Design utterly overthrown. But now we return to the remainder of the precedent success.</P>
<P>Presently after the taking of this Castle, the Victors sent a <HI>Canoo</HI> with Let∣ters to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Governor of <HI>Atzin,</HI> thereby requiring him to surrender that Place: But he well knowing they could not come up to him in that season of the year, answer'd, <HI>That he would keep the Fort for the King, and expect our Forces.</HI> Then by advice of the whole Council of War, the Redoubt upon <HI>St. Jago</HI> was repair'd, as also a Battery that was fall'n, adjoining to the Works of the Castle; from whence they may scowre the Shore of the River, and relieve the Sea-Battery.</P>
<P>On the West-side of the Castle stands a pretty large Town,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town <HI>Myna</HI> at the <HI>Myne.</HI></NOTE> close built, by the <HI>Portugals</HI> call'd <HI>Del Myn;</HI> but by the <HI>Blacks, Dana,</HI> or <HI>Dang;</HI> extending far in length, but lieth so low, that at a Spring-Tide the Sea in some places runs through the Streets: And on the other side runs the Salt-River <HI>Benja;</HI> which not onely hinders the passage out of the Town, but makes the adjacent Coun∣trey very Moorish. This River formerly was ten or eleven Foot deep at low Water, but now so shallow, that it is not passable for Ketches, which draw four Foot Water.</P>
<P>This Town is naturally very strong, being (as we said) shut up between the River and the Sea, so that the Enemy hath no other approach, than at the end of <HI>Kommany,</HI> where the <HI>Portugals,</HI> as a Security from the <HI>Blacks,</HI> had rais'd a Stone-wall from the Sea to the River, and made a Battery.</P>
<P>About half a mile from <HI>St.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Ʋtri.</HI></NOTE> Jago,</HI> floweth the River <HI>Utri,</HI> but full of Cliffs, and altogether unpassable, yet affords this Commodity, that not onely the <HI>Blacks</HI> from the Town daily fetch thence their Water, but also the Ships; there being within two miles no Springs to be found.</P>
<P>The Countrey hereabout yields little Fruit;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The constitution of the Countrey.</NOTE> therefore most of their Food is <HI>Mille</HI> to make Bread of; <HI>Safoe</HI> or Wine of Palms, Sugar, <HI>Ananae's, Injame's,</HI> Pota∣toe's, Wine of <HI>Bordean,</HI> are brought to them from <HI>Fetu, Abrembe, Commendo, A∣kane,</HI> and exchang'd in Barter for half Gold, half Fish.</P>
<PB N="429" REF="269"/>
<P>This Town with the neighbouring Land, the <HI>Portugals</HI> boasted for the plea∣santness and most fertile place on the whole Coast, and as an effectual proof thereof, would often bestow upon other Traders some gifts of Apples, Coco-Nuts, and such like things, which they (though without reason) thought grew there: but now the contrary is most evident, for <HI>Moure, Kormantine,</HI> and other Towns in that Tract, in pleasantness, Plants, and Provisions, far exceed it. 'Tis true however, this Town goes beyond the rest for number of Inhabitants, being able in time of War to raise two thousand men fit for service. They are a mixture of <HI>Black's</HI> and <HI>Mulattoe's,</HI> which last being <HI>Portuguez</HI> Christians, amount to the number of two hundred, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>The whole maintain themselves with Fishing,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Employment.</NOTE> going out to Sea with four or five hundred <HI>Canoo's,</HI> and in every <HI>Canoo</HI> two or three persons; they sell the Fish to them of <HI>Fetu, Abrembo,</HI> and <HI>Commendo</HI> for <HI>Mille,</HI> Wine of <HI>Palm,</HI> Sugar, and the like; as is before-mention'd.</P>
<P>The Jurisdiction of <HI>Myne</HI> was divided between the Kings of <HI>Guaffo</HI> and <HI>Fetu:</HI> but this burthen the <HI>Portugal's</HI> remov'd, so that it seems a kind of Corporation under the subjection of the Castle, and hath several superior Officers of their own; and in that state and condition they are at this day.</P>
<P>The constitution of which Government they have thus modell'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Government of the Town the <HI>Myne.</HI></NOTE> every Quarter or Precinct, the whole Town being divided into three, is rul'd by a peculiar <HI>Braffo</HI> or Captain, and <HI>Kaboseroe's</HI> or Officers; but they all assemble upon any emergency, in the house of the chiefest Captain, where they first ex∣hibit all complaints, and from thence remit them to the Commander in Chief of the Castle for redress, from whose sentence there is yet an appeal to the Ge∣neral, who concludes the whole matter, and all parties rest satisfi'd with his Determination; and by this means they live quietly and peaceably.</P>
<P>But if any difference arise between them and the <HI>Commender's</HI> or <HI>Fetuan's,</HI> for the more speedy decision thereof, the whole Commonalty taking the injury done to a particular person as to themselves, immediately complain to the General, with request, that the Rights and Priviledges of the Members pre∣judic'd may be ratifi'd, and to that end, that he would promise with power to obtain remedy. In such occasions the <HI>Portugal's</HI> always readily interpos'd, and accompany'd them to War against the adverse party; whereby at length they came to be of great repute for Valor among their Neighbours.</P>
<P>They are all (as hath been said) expert Fishers, being not onely their chief employment, but of such esteem, that they are priz'd beyond all Artificers.</P>
<P>Of what they catch, they pay to the Castle the fifth Fish for Custom. Some few get a living by Polishing of Coral which is brought thither.</P>
<P>Their Religion hath some tincture of Christianity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Religion and worship.</NOTE> which they learnt from the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> with whom they Inter-marry'd; from which mixture have pro∣ceeded several <HI>Mulattoe's</HI> there resident.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moure.</NOTE> standing in five degrees and ten minutes North Latitude, upon a ri∣sing ground, near the Castle of <HI>Nassau,</HI> is a pretty large Town, almost as big as <HI>Myna,</HI> but not so rich or populous by a fourth part, being not able to raise above two hundred men; the largeness of the extent arising from the wide di∣stances of the Houses one from another.</P>
<P>This Town was the first, with whom the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at the beginning, when they endeavour'd to Trade along this Coast, had friendship, and gave them Li∣cense to come a Shore: whereupon the <HI>Portugal's</HI> for spight, came one night and brake all their <HI>Canoo's</HI> in pieces.</P>
<P>Formerly <HI>Moure,</HI> so long as the <HI>Portugal's</HI> held the Castle of <HI>Myna,</HI> was wont to be the most Eminent place of Trade on the whole Gold-Coast; for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> because of their Ships, came to Anchor there, and the <HI>Blacks</HI> came out of the Countrey thither along the Shore to Trade.

<P>Thus much as to the Countrey in general; we will now proceed to declare a more particular Relation of its Nature, Air, Plants, Beasts, Customs, and Religions, and what else obviously we meet with concerning the same.</P>
<P>¶ THe whole <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Countrey.</NOTE> especially about <HI>Myna,</HI> appears Wild, Desolate, Mountainous, and full of Woods, having such narrow Ways, that two cannot go together, and those so incumbred and over-grown with Bram∣bles and Trees, that the Sun can hardly through their density be discern'd: in short, they are fit hiding-places for Thieves, and yet few such found there.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cape de Tres Puntas</HI> to <HI>Akara,</HI> it lies high; and higher up into the Land the Soil is fruitful, intermingled with good Pasturage, very convenient for the Feeding of Cattel in; as also for Planting of <HI>Mille</HI> and other Corn, the Shore extending East North-East.</P>
<P>The People here know not what a Frost means,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is no Prest.</NOTE> so that indeed we may just∣ly say, they have no Winter, but one continual Summer, covered by the con∣tinual Heats of the Air and Sun: yet notwithstanding this certain warm tem∣perature of the Clime, hath distinguish'd the Seasons of the Year, attributing some Moneths to Summer, others to Winter, by peculiar observing the difference of the Weather: and accordingly they reckon it Winter when the Sun shines in a Perpendicular Line from the Vertical Point of the Heavens upon their Heads, which happens in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>June;</HI> and they judge it Summer when the Sun is farthest from them, which is in <HI>October, Novem∣ber,
<PB N="445" REF="279"/>December,</HI> and <HI>February;</HI> the reasons whereof we will endeavour briefly to give you.</P>
<P>In <HI>January</HI> blow along this Coast out of the South-West hard Sea-Storms, but harder in <HI>February,</HI> which sometimes bring with them a Hericane, and sometimes Rain. In the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> and beginning of <HI>April,</HI> great Tempests a rise both at Sea and Land, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Ternados;</HI> and by the Inhabitants, <HI>Agombrettou;</HI> attended with great Rains, mixt with Thunder, Lightning, and Earthquakes, which continue to the end of <HI>May:</HI> They fore∣see the coming of this strange Weather by the clouding of the Skie in the South-East; yet then is the Sowing-time for <HI>Mille.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ternados</HI> past, the long Rains begin and continue in a manner without ceasing to the beginning of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>These Rains bringing a sudden chilness upon the Air,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The alteration of the Weather occasions Sick∣ness.</NOTE> which newly before was as it were parching hot, occasions oftentimes in the Bodies of Foreigners there resident, strange Sicknesses, because they know not how to preserve themselves from the Cold and Wet so well as the <HI>Blacks:</HI> and moreover, the Skins of the <HI>Blacks</HI> are so hardned by the heat, that, as if naturaliz'd, they are lit∣tle offended thereby; whereas the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> living in colder Cli∣mates, when they feel those violent scorchings, to them unaccustom'd, fall into violent Sweats, which by an insensible transipration exhales even the radical Moisture, and so leaving the Vitals without assistance, subject the Body to all casual Infirmities.</P>
<P>During the Season of Rain, <HI>viz. May</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> little or no Land-Winds stir; but from the Sea; they blow out of the South-West, and West South-West, causing the Waves to rowl very high.</P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> the Rainy Season begins to cease; and yet then the Sea hath a rowl∣ing motion, with tumultuous Billows.</P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> the Weather grows fair, and the Air clear, with gentle South-Winds.</P>
<P>In <HI>October, November, December, January,</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> they reckon the Summer; for then is the fairest Weather of the whole Year, especially in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>Janu∣ary,</HI> which have the hottest days. In <HI>February</HI> stiff Land-Winds begin to blow; one especially, among the <HI>Blacks</HI> call'd from one of their Moneths <HI>Hermanta,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wind <HI>Hermanta.</HI></NOTE> coming out of the East South-East, and continues sometimes not above three or four days, and sometimes almost a fortnight; otherwhiles a whole moneth, though very seldom: Then is the Air cold, foggy, and moist, with some sharpness; whereby many, especially Forreigners, get sore Eyes.</P>
<P>There are also every day two several Winds, (as we said before) the Land∣wind, beginning in the Morning, which they call <HI>Bofoe;</HI> and towards Noon, the Sea-wind, and by them call'd <HI>Agan-Brettou.</HI></P>
<P>Of Fruits this Countrey is reasonably provided,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plants and Fruits.</NOTE> which they feed upon the whole year.</P>
<P>First, there grows Rice, also <HI>Turkish</HI> Wheat call'd by the <HI>Indians, Mays;</HI> which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> brought out of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> to the Island <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> and from thence carry'd over to the <HI>Gold-Coast</HI> to supply their necessities: For be∣fore the coming of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> this Plant was unknown to the Inhabitants. But at this day the Countrey is fill'd therewith, whereof they chiefly make Bread.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mille,</HI> or <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE> the usual Bread-Corn of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> grows there in abundance, which the Inhabitants have had from all ages.
<PB N="446" REF="280"/>The Seed bears a resemblance of our Tares, but sweeter of Taste, and white, and grows with long Ears like Bearded-Wheat, or Rye. It attains perfect growth and maturity in three Moneths; then being cut down, it lies in the Field a Moneth to dry: And lastly, the Ears cut off and bound in Bundles, and brought into their Huts, the Straw serves for a Cover to the Habitations. Of this (as we said) being a Juicy and excellent Grain, they make Bread with little labour, considering it must not be Ground.</P>
<P>They have also Potatoe's, <HI>Jams</HI> or <HI>In-Jams,</HI> which grow like Turnips, un∣der the Ground, and boil'd afford as good Food: So the <HI>Bananasses,</HI> and <HI>Ba∣koves</HI> they use with equal advantage, as we Apples or Pears.</P>
<P><HI>Ananasses</HI> not much eaten, because of their tartness; yet remarkable in this, that the longer they are kept, the more they Grow.</P>
<P>Of Lemmons and Oranges they have great plenty; yet the Inhabitants make little use of them, for the before-mention'd reason: But the Lemmons are by the <HI>European</HI> Merchants bought up, who Press out the Juyce into Vessels to Transport.</P>
<P><HI>Palmeto</HI>-Trees grow in every place, from whence they daily get so much Wine, that seldom any in the evening can be found Sober: In like manner al∣so, they get Tow to make Ropes from the Rind, and extract Oyl of Palm from the Nuts.</P>

<P>But Apes, or Monkies, are almost innumerable.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apes.</NOTE></P>
<P>Gatamountains breed here of two sorts; one with white Beards,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catamountains.</NOTE> black Faces, and a speckled Skin, white under their Bellies, with a broad black List on their Backs, and black Tails; the other, with white Noses; all which are catcht by the <HI>Blacks</HI> with Snares, hang'd on the Trees.</P>
<P>There are also some Civet-Cats, call'd <HI>Kankan.</HI></P>
<P>¶ THe Fowl here are not onely numerous, but bold,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowls.</NOTE> by reason they are seldom shot or catcht; some bearing the same shape with those of <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI> other differing, and strange: As first, blew Parrots, which taken young out of their Nest, learn much better to speak, than such as have flown Wild; but they never learn to Speak so plain as the green <HI>Brasilian</HI> Parrots.</P>
<P>There are also a kind of Green Birds, with Orange Spots on their Bills, and long Tails, which the <HI>Blacks</HI> call <HI>Ahuront,</HI> and we, Paraketo's:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paraketo's.</NOTE> and an∣other like the former, somewhat bigger, and of a Blood-red Colour, with a black Spot on their Bills, and a black Tail.</P>
<P>A kind of Gold-Finch, yellow Body'd, Breeds here likewise, but for fear of the Serpents and other venemous Beasts, build their Nests on slender Boughs of high Trees. In the Fields, amongst the <HI>Mille,</HI> Nest a sort of Bull-Finches, which the <HI>Blacks</HI> put alive in their Mouths, and eat with the Skin and Feathers on: so Sparrows also, and many other small Birds.</P>
<P>There are other Birds like Cranes, with a head like a Turky-Cock, but so mischievously devouring, that the <HI>Blacks</HI> to prevent their coming down, carry them Food to the Mountains: they continually dabble in the Dirt, and all manner of noisome Filth, that they stink, even at a distance, as bad as the most loathsome Carrion.</P>
<P>Also Water-Snipes, Turtle-Doves, with a black Ring on their Necks; Phea∣sants, Spotted with white, but the Flesh unsavoury; and Peacocks, in shape like ours, but with some difference of Feathers.</P>
<P>The Bird <HI>Pettoir</HI> the <HI>Blacks</HI> look upon as a great Presager of good or ill Fortune, and therefore esteem it much.</P>
<P>The Cranes, Hearons, Storks, Crows, and Lapwings, differ not much from those with us; onely the Crows are Parti-colour'd, such as we have in <HI>England</HI> about <HI>Royston,</HI> and therefore styl'd, <HI>Royston-Crows.</HI></P>
<P>Owls, Batts, Gnats, and great black Pismires, that make holes in the earth like Field-Mice, and do much hurt to Bees, which they rob both of Honey and Wax.</P>
<P>Land-Crabbs, or Tortoises, by them call'd <HI>Bonzeronzes,</HI> of a Purple Colour,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Land-Crabs, or Lob∣sters.</NOTE> which keep under ground like Moles, they eat with delight, as a most desira∣ble Dainty.</P>
<P>Serpents and Adders, of an extraordinary magnitude, are found here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents.</NOTE> using
<PB N="448" REF="281"/>both the Land and Water; having a Belly and Mouth so big, that they can swallow Hens, and Geese whole: Some of the <HI>Negro's</HI> think their flesh fit to be eaten; but how it nourishes, their Diseases caus'd by such foul Feeding, give the best account.</P>
<P>Sometimes these Countries are plagu'd with Locusts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Locusts, or Grashop∣pers.</NOTE> which come flying out of <HI>Arabia</HI> in such numerous Shoals,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They spoil the Fruits of the Field.</NOTE> as cloud the Sun; and where they fall, eat up all they find, whether Corn, Grass, or Fruits; which certain hazard, makes the People so careless and unconcern'd for the future, that they never lay up any Store of Corn, but Sow and Plant onely so much, as they guess they may spend in the whole Year.</P>
<P>Divers Villages lying near the Sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt.</NOTE> have Salt-Pans; as <HI>Antin, Labbede, Sinko,</HI> and others; but the best are at <HI>Antin,</HI> and <HI>Sinko:</HI> from whence carry'd thorow the whole Countrey to be sold.</P>
<P>They make their Salt very Fine and White,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is made.</NOTE> and with little trouble, by rea∣son it needs to be but once boyl'd. When made ready in manner aforesaid, they put it into small Rush Baskets, like Loaf-Sugar, covering it over with green Leaves, that it may not grow brown by the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey produces Gold,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Countrey is full of Gold.</NOTE> which the <HI>Blacks</HI> call <HI>Chilea;</HI> some found on the Shore, and at Low-water, sought for by the Women, and found by Pie∣ces, to the valew of a Noble.</P>
<P>But that which chiefly comes to <HI>Europe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">From whence the Gold comes.</NOTE> is Digged out of the Rivers, or Mynes by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> far up within Land, and by them brought, and sold to those of <HI>Fantyn, Akanian, Adom, Akara,</HI> and other places, in Barter for <HI>European</HI> Wares; for few which live in these places, know the Mynes, nor hath any <HI>Whites</HI> ever been by, or near the same: For every particular King sets secure Guards upon the Mynes within his Dominion, wherein he imploys his Slaves to work; and when he hath gotten a quantity together, he Trafficks for it with others, lying nearer the Shore; till by the passing through many hands, it at last arrives in the Trading Ships of the <HI>European</HI> Merchants.</P>
<P>In some places,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Gold is taken up in the River.</NOTE> especially at the plentiful Gold-River <HI>Atzine,</HI> under the Cliffs and Water-falls, shooting down from the Mountains, Gold is taken up, in this manner: They Dive with a hollow Woodden Tray to the bottom, and rake there among the Earth, Stones, and all that they can come at; with which ha∣ving filled their Dishes, they come up above Water, and washing the Mass, find the Gold; for sometimes whole pieces are wash't down by force of the Water, through the Gold-Veins; whereof the King of <HI>Egwira</HI> hath a great many, which he keeps for his Fancy, ascribing a secret Power and Vertue to it.</P>
<P>Sometimes they get by this Diving good store of Gold, but otherwhiles in whole days make no advantage.</P>
<P>Besides this Diving,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what manner the Gold is found.</NOTE> Gold is found in divers other manners, <HI>viz.</HI> in pieces like Beans, or in Dust as small as Sand, or Filings of Copper; yet being very ragged, like broken Coral, or Stone, and intermingled with Grit, Clay, or Earth, which they cleanse in the running Streams; yet not so, but that much Dross remains among it.</P>
<P>Many hold opinion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what Tract of Land the Gold is found.</NOTE> that all the Gold found and had near the Coast of <HI>Guinee,</HI> is gotten within twenty miles of the Sea-shore, in a Tract of Land from <HI>Cape de Tres Puntas,</HI> till they come beyond <HI>Pichy</HI> and <HI>Sinko;</HI> so concluding, for that they of <HI>Soko,</HI> lying onely three or four days Journey from the Shore, know of no Gold, neither have they any Trade in it; and beyond <HI>Pichy</HI> and <HI>Sinko</HI> they have scarcely heard how they dig it.</P>

<P>Adjoining to the Village <HI>Little Commendo,</HI> near the Sea, lies a Hill,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Gold-Mountain near <HI>Little-Commende.</HI></NOTE> which ap∣pearing to contain in its bowels much Gold, in the Year Sixteen hundred twenty two, the Inhabitants begun to dig for it, but because they were ig∣norant in the method of Myning, the hollowed Earth fell in, smothering di∣vers of the Workmen: wherefore the King of <HI>Guaffo</HI> by advice Issued out an Edict, that none might dig any more therein; and so that Work remain'd ever since unattempted.</P>
<P>The Natives make strange reports of unusual Apparitions within the Mynes, as that sometimes there is such a noise and tumult heard,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conceit of the <HI>Blacks</HI> of the Gold-Mynes.</NOTE> that none dares stay there; and that otherwhiles the Laborers are driven thence by force and violence, without seeing any thing; and that sometimes a Golden Dog, or such like Beast appears to them on a sudden, and straightway vanishes again. Things that to lighter Judgments may seem fabulous, yet credited by Antiquity, and, as we may suppose, not without reason;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pliny.</NOTE> for they making <HI>Pluto</HI> the God of Riches, 'tis no marvel if he defend his Possession, thus vio∣lently, and without his leave, invaded and ransacked. But whether those re∣lated Fancies of the <HI>Blacks</HI> be true or not, signifies little; however, this we may be infallibly assur'd of, that this Gold is gotten with great labor and trou∣ble: for if any can find two or three

<P>The Air, to all but its Natives, proves very unwholsom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air unhealthy in the <HI>Gold-Coast</HI> to Strangers.</NOTE> as experi∣ence teacheth: for all Strangers which lie on Shore, whether in Forts or Store-houses, are afflicted with grievous and mortal Sicknesses; whereas on the contrary, the <HI>Indigenae</HI> look fresh, live healthy, and attain to a great Age.</P>
<P>Some of the most Ingenious <HI>Blacks</HI> attribute the cause thereof to the multi∣plicity of Lightning and Thunder; whose frequency diffuseth the Infection, as the two sorts of Winds from Sea and Land, dissipate unhealthy Fogs and Vapors.</P>

<P>Foreigners which come to <HI>Guinee,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worms.</NOTE> especially this <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> are very much tormented with Worms breeding in their Bodies; so also are the <HI>Blacks</HI> about <HI>Myna;</HI> whereas those that live four and twenty miles lower Easterly, are al∣ways free from that trouble.</P>
<P>These Worms call'd <HI>Ikkon,</HI> do not affect every one equally that hath been there, but some sooner, others later: some get them while they are yet upon the Coast; others in their Voyages; a third after the ending of their Voyage, nay, four, five, six, yea, twelve Moneths after their coming home; and others have been two or three times there, and never had any touch of them.</P>
<P>From whence they have their original and breed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Original.</NOTE> hath been much dispu∣ted: some lay the cause upon their excessive use of <HI>Venus,</HI> some upon their eating of Fish which have Worms in their Bodies, or upon much Swim∣ming and running into the cold Water; others, that they proceed from the over-much Drinking of <HI>Palmito</HI>-Wine, eating of <HI>Kankaiens,</HI> that is, their Bread made of <HI>Mille:</HI> but all these seem meer Fancies, without a shew of reason; for divers in all those particulars most temperate, have nevertheless this Distem∣per; whereas on the contrary, others the most loose and debauched have ne∣ver had any of them. But those speak with most probability, who say that these Vermine proceed either from a peculiar Malignity in the Air, or from drinking of the Water which the <HI>Negro's</HI> draw out of Wells in some places, and sell to the <HI>Whites:</HI> for most true it is, that several have drank much Water, and yet not been afflicted with Worms, but then they resided at <HI>Akara,</HI> and other adjacent places; but those which lie before <HI>Moure,</HI> and drink of that Wa∣ter, shall be tormented with that <HI>Elminthick</HI> Evil.</P>
<P>These Worms breed in several manners;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">By what accident they come.</NOTE> in some they bring Fevers, or sha∣king Agues; in others, fainting Fits, with great pain: in some they cause Frensie; some can neither go nor stand, or lie, or sit, while others scarce feel a Distemper. They shew themselves with a little Pimple or red Spot, hard in the Flesh; wherein sometimes may be seen the Worms between that and the Skin: at last they cause Ulcers upon the Ball of the Foot, on the Arms, Knees, Thighes, or Hips, and indeed in all fleshy places, continuing with some near three Moneths, whereas others have scarce any pain three Weeks, yet perhaps have ten Worms hanging out of the Flesh and Skin at once.</P>
<P>The Worms are of several lengths and bigness;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Form.</NOTE> some a Yard, others a Yard and a half long, and some shorter; but generally as thick or big as the Bass-String of a Theorboe.</P>
<P>The Cure cannot be perfected till the Worm breaks through the Skin,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Curing.</NOTE> and thrusts out his Head; then they tie it, that it may not creep in again, and at length draw it quite out; which they do by winding the end hanging out about a Spoon: if in the extracting it happens to break, there commonly en∣sueth a renewing of the Wound. The <HI>Blacks</HI> never use any means, but onely wash the affected part with salt Water. But the best Cure is to cleanse the Body of putrifi'd humors, and to anoint the place with fresh Butter. In the performing which Cure, the Place where the Worm appears must be defend∣ed against Cold, to prevent swelling and exulceration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negro's,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Venerial Pox.</NOTE> among other Sicknesses, are very subject to the Venerial Pox; which they cure by drinking <HI>Sarsaparilla.</HI></P>
<P>Wounds, by them call'd <HI>Mapira,</HI> growing from Blows, they cleanse little, without using any Medicine, because they have none, nor any Chirurgions to apply them.</P>

<P>Swellings which will not ripen, or come to Suppuration,

<P>They use no artificial <HI>Pbloebotomy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they let Bloud.</NOTE> but onely cut the Flesh till the Blood comes out.</P>
<P>All the help they give the Sick, is to Shave them, if Parents or Chil∣dren, otherwise they will not offer them one drop of Water or Oyl, but let them perish with hunger and perplexity. The Sick are call'd <HI>Myarri,</HI> and mor∣tal Diseases <HI>Jarbakkasi,</HI> and a dead Body <HI>Ou.</HI></P>

Their Visages seem to shine with Sweat, or else foul'd with Dirt, Scurf and Nastiness; continuing Beardless till thirty years old: their Shoulders broad, Arms brawny, with great Hands and long Fingers, whereupon they let their Nails grow like Claws, sometimes to the length of a Joynt, and as a great ornament, is especially used among the Nobility. Lastly, they have little Bel∣lies, broad Feet, long Toes, and furnish'd, as most of the <HI>Blacks</HI> upon the <HI>Guinee</HI> Coast, with large Propagators.</P>
<P>They have quick and ready Wits, to help in any sudden emergency,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Kind.</NOTE> and shew themselves withall very considerate, whereunto they adde great craft and subtlety. Covetousness they learn from their Cradles, which makes them always craving, and with such petulancy, as not to receive a denial. Courteous enough in outward appearance to Strangers, but envious, and gi∣ven to revenge amongst one another; and where they can play the Masters, fear not to manifest their Ambition, Treachery, domineering and supercilious Tyranny.</P>
<P>The People neighboring the Shore, both Men and Women,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expert in Swimming.</NOTE> have great skill in Swimming; but the Men within Land use it so little, that they seem afraid at the sight of any great River. They can keep long under Water, and Dive exceeding deep; wherefore the <HI>Portugals</HI> bring of the expertest from hence to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> to use them in the Pearl-fishing in the Island <HI>Margaretta.</HI> Children not exceeding two years of Age betake themselves instantly to the Water, and learn to Swim, because unskilfulness therein is counted a great shame.</P>
<P>The Women are slender-Body'd, and cheerful of disposition, but have such great Breasts, that they can fling them over their Shoulders, and give their Children Suck that hang at their backs.</P>
<P>They have great inclinations to Dancing;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women are inclin'd to Dancing.</NOTE> so that when they hear a Drum or other Instrument, they cannot stand quiet, but must shew their Skill. They meet usually in the Evenings to Revel; while some Dance, others Play upon Instruments, as Copper Panns, struck with Buttons, or Drums made of a hol∣low Tree, and cover'd over with a Goats Skin, or such like barbarous Musick. They Dance commonly two and two together,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of Castinetto's came from <HI>Africa.</HI></NOTE> Leaping and Stamping with their Feet, Snapping with their Fingers, and Bowing their Heads one to ano∣ther; some have Horses Tails in their Hands, which they cast one while upon one Shoulder, and one while upon the other; others with Wisps of Straw in their hands, which they let fall, then again suddenly reaching it, they
<PB N="452" REF="283"/>cast it up aloft, and catch it in their hands. This Dancing having continu'd an hour, or an hour and a half, every one returns home. Besides these Evening-Pastimes, they have a sort of Dancing-Schools, wherein the younger Breed are taught.</P>
<P>These People are seldom free from Lice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Blacks</HI> are Lowsie, though Clean.</NOTE> and Fleas, although they keep themselves clean in their Bodies, for they Wash every Morning and Evening from Head to Foot, and anoint themselves with Oyl of Palm, or Suet, to make them look Smooth, and that the Flies may not bite their Naked Body. The Women moreover anoint themselves with Civet, and fine smelling Herbs, to be the more acceptable to their Husbands. They count it a great shame to Break Wind in the presence of any: they never do their Easement upon the ground, but make a Hut, whereinto they retire, and when full, burn them to Ashes. They cannot Evacuate their Water in a continu'd Current, as usual in humane Creatures, but rather like Hoggs, by intermissive girdings.</P>
<P>When they meet any of their Friends or Acquaintance in the Morning,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Salutation.</NOTE> they Salute them with great Courtesie, Imbracing one the other in their Arms, and closing the two first Fingers of the Right Hand, snap two or three times toge∣ther, each time bowing their Heads, and saying, <HI>Auzy, Auzy,</HI> that is, <HI>Good Mor∣row, Good Morrow.</HI></P>
<P>Another (as it were) innate quality they have to Steal any thing they lay hands of,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exquisite in Stealing.</NOTE> especially from Foreigners, and among themselves make boast there∣of, as an ingenious piece of Subtilty; and so generally runs this vicious humor through the whole Race of <HI>Blacks,</HI> that great and rich Merchants do sometimes practise small Filching; for being come to the Trading Ships, they are not at rest till they have taken away something, though but Nails, or Lead, that is Nail'd to the outside of the Ships to prevent Worm-eating: which no sooner done, then with a singular sleight of hand, they convey from one to another; but if they chance to be trapp'd, they all leap instantly over-Board for fear of Beating; but if caught, and soundly Bastinado'd, then as past doubt of other punishment, they never avoid the Ship, but come again the next day to Trade.</P>
<P>They little esteem any Promises made to Foreigners,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They keep little of their Promises.</NOTE> but break them if they can see any advantage in it; in brief, they are a treacherous, perjur'd, subtle, and false People, onely shewing Friendship to those they have most need of. When they make a Promise or Oath to the <HI>Whites,</HI> they cast their Face to the Ground; then bowing, speak these words thrice, <HI>Jau, Jau, Jau,</HI> every time stri∣king their hands together, and stamping upon the ground with their feet, and lastly kiss their <HI>Fetisy,</HI> or <HI>Sants,</HI> which they wear upon their Legs, and Arms.</P>

Others add thereto <HI>Maizr.</HI></P>
<P>They seldom eat Flesh,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Food.</NOTE> but all sorts of Fish; Potatoes also, and <HI>Injames,</HI> which they Boyl; as also <HI>Bananasses, Bakovens, Rice,</HI> and several other sorts of Fruit which the Countrey affords.</P>

<P>Their daily Drink is Water and Palm-Wine;

<P>The Men Drink stoutly, especially hot Liquors, such as Palm-Wine,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Men are inclin'd to Drinking.</NOTE> Bran∣dy, and other Wine, so that the Evening seldom sees them Sober: In Drink∣ing they use strange Customs; for the first Drinker must lay his Hands upon his Head, and with a loud voyce cry out <HI>Tautosi, Tautosi:</HI> After Drinking they poure a little as an Oblation to their <HI>Fetisi</HI> upon the Earth, crying aloud I.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unmannerly.</NOTE> and throw them into their Mouthes down their Throat, without ever casting it beside.</P>
<P>¶ WAlled Cities they have none, nor good Towns near the Sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns or Villages what they are.</NOTE> onely upon the Shore some Villages appear, of no great consequence, be∣ing ill-favoredly built, and worse order'd; for they so stink of Dirt and Filthi∣ness, that sometimes when the Land-Wind blows, the Stench may be smell'd a mile and a half in the Sea. The Towns more within the Land are much bigger, and fuller of Trade, and People who live more at ease; for such as live at the Sea, are Interpreters, Brokers, Rowers, Skippers, or Seamen, Ser∣vants, Fishers, and Slaves of the other. But although, as we said, the Towns lie open round about, and not inclosed; yet they are commonly built in pla∣ces of Defence: for they stand on high Hills, encompassed with Woods, and have no other comings to them, but through small Paths, which are easily to be defended.</P>
<P>Their Houses are very sleight, and little better than Hog-Styes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> or at the best like the Tents in Forts, or Bulwarks, being erected in the following form: Four Trees, or Posts, to a Man's heighth, are set in a Square in the Earth,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Roof.</NOTE> and is the chiefest Pride, and greatest ornament of their Habitations. The Roof consists of two four-square pieces, made of Palm-Tree Leaves, standing sloaping aloft, and bound close together when it rains;

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Floor.</NOTE> being made fast with a cord or rope of <HI>Mille</HI>-straw: The Floor compacted of Red-earth, laid very flat and even with a round hole in the middle, to set the Pot with Wine <HI>de Palm</HI> in, when they drink with one another. Commonly such a House is built in eight or ten days, and one may buy it for twenty Shillings, or little more. Three or four of these Huts always stand together in a square, with a Yard in the middle, where the Wo∣men boyl their Meat, hedg'd about with Straw of <HI>Mille</HI> to the heighth of a Man.</P>
<PB N="454" REF="284"/>
<P>In this manner the Houses stand all in a heap, onely parted by the afore∣mention'd Straw of <HI>Mille,</HI> and no farther distant from one another, than that one man can go between; so that the Passages are meerly narrow Alleys, and very slippery in the time of Rain, by reason of the fatness of the earth; but they dry up again in Sun-shiny Weather as hard as stone.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Houses of the <HI>Braffo.</HI></NOTE> or Governor, stand commonly by the Market, and hath none other adjoyning thereto, but onely those of his Wives and Children; they are somewhat larger and bigger than those of the common people, and cover'd with Straw of <HI>Mille.</HI> His People and Guards have every one a particular Chamber. In the middle of his Court stands a square Hut, open round about, but cover'd on the top, wherein he sits in the day-time with his Nobility that come to speak with him. Before the Court-Gate stands always two Pots in the Ground with fresh Water, for their <HI>Fetiso</HI> to drink out of.</P>
<P>The best of their Houshold-stuff is commonly one or two wooden Chests,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houshold-stuffe.</NOTE> bought of the <HI>Whites,</HI> wherein they Lock all they possess; so that little can be seen in their Houses. They have some <HI>Kalabasses,</HI> which they call <HI>Akoffo,</HI> made of the Straw of <HI>Mille,</HI> wherein they commonly carry their Wares and other Goods to sell. Their Arms, such as Shields, Assagays, or Launces, hang on the Wall for Ornament. The remaining part of their Goods consists in a Mat to sleep on, two or three stumps of wood for Stools, a Pot or two to boyl in, two or three <HI>Kalabasses</HI> to drink Palm-Wine out of, and a great Kettle to wash themselves in.</P>
<P>Along the whole Coast the Inhabitants use light and nimble Boats,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are made.</NOTE> They are made of one entire piece of Wood, or the body of a Tree cut long-ways with Cutting-Knives; then made hollow on the sides, and narrow above, with a flat bottom, and without any covering over head; the Ends before and behind narrow, and close together as a Hand-bow, and almost in the same fashion; the Head somewhat lower, the Sides a finger thick, and the Bottom two: And after the hollowing, they burn the Wood with Straw, to prevent Worms, and cleaving by the Sun.</P>
<P>At each End the <HI>Canoo</HI> hath a Bowe like a Galley,

<P>Furthermore, for the prevention of Mishaps, and as good <HI>Omens</HI> of a hap∣py Voyage, they deck them with several Fancies and Conceits; as the Ears of <HI>Mille,</HI> and other painted Emblems and Devices. Some when they go a long Journey, kill (to the Honour of their <HI>Fetisi</HI>) a Sheep or Buck, and hang the same open'd at the head of their <HI>Canoo</HI> for a show.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Mongoba, Konda-Quoia, Ruono-Monou,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Places where no <HI>Canoos</HI> are used.</NOTE> and some others in <HI>Gessymonou,</HI> use no <HI>Canoos;</HI> but the <HI>Korredebo's,</HI> near <HI>Rio de Galhinas</HI> or <HI>Maqualbary,</HI> and such as have many Lakes in their Countrey, pass over in <HI>Canoos.</HI> All others make Bridges, which they fasten on the other side of the River to Trees, and bind them fast with small Ropes, which serve in stead of Railes to hold by, that by the swinging they may not fall off. These Bridges they make, how wide soever the Rivers be, and go with heavy burthens over them, and by rea∣son of their shaking, call them <HI>Jenge, Jenge,</HI> and extraordinarily necessary, by reason of the fierce Cataracts of Water falling from the high Cliffs, sufficient to bear down fixed Bridges, and altogether unpassable by <HI>Canoos.</HI></P>
<P>The men of all degrees go habited, either in Linnen,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cloathing of the Men.</NOTE> or Cotton Cloth girt round about their middle, and hanging down to their Knees.</P>
<P>They have a great fancy in Shaving their Hair,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How their Hair is drest.</NOTE> wherein they observe no particular fashion; for one cuts it like a half-Moon, another Crossways, the third with three or four Tufts; so that amongst fifteen men, hardly two are alike.</P>
<P>They wear as an Ornament on their Arms, Rings of Ivory, strip'd and streak'd with Crosses, three or four on one Arm, and about their Necks a String of <HI>Venetian</HI> Crystal, or Coral, which they break into pieces; but persons of Eminency wear them commonly of Gold: As also on their Legs, Strings of small Christal, mix'd with Golden Studds, and other Ornaments of Gold. At their Feet they have commonly some Wisps, or other stuff hanging, kept for their <HI>Sants</HI> which they call <HI>Fetisies.</HI> On their Heads some wear Caps made of the Peeling of Trees, with a long Tail ty'd to it, in stead of a Hat-band, dy'd and drawn with several Colours. Others have Caps or Hats of Sedge or Reeds; a third, Hats with broad Brims, Woven of green Bulrushes; a fourth, made of Dogs-skins, and <HI>Cabriets</HI> or Sheep-skins.</P>
<P>The Women go Apparell'd in Linnen for the most part, fasten'd or ty'd close under their Breasts, somewhat above the middle, and reaching to the Knees with a Girdle of a hand-breadth, Red, Blew, or Yellow, to which hang their Knives, Purses, and Keys for an Ornament; besides many Tassels of their <HI>Sants</HI> or <HI>Fe∣tisies.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they go Cloth'd in the house, but when they walk abroad, they lay off this Garment, and washing their Bodies from top to Toe, put on a longer, co∣ming down to their Feet like a Petticoat, over which, as the former, girt close, being Mantlewise, they throw another of Say, or other such thin Stuff.</P>
<P>Their Heads are finely drest, and their Hair neatly Plaited,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Head-gear of the Women.</NOTE> in the midst with a Tuft, trim'd round about with Strings, anointed with Oyl of Palm; in their Hair they have usually long slender <HI>Kammeties</HI> or Bodkins, with two Teeth, about the length of a Finger, with which they thrust in their Hair, when any thing troubles them; also in Salutation they draw these Bodkins out of their Heads,
<PB N="456" REF="286"/>and stick them in again. Upon their Foreheads they have three or four Cuts, about the length of the first Joynt of a Finger; so also on their Cheeks, which being swell'd up, they Paint with several Colours: Beneath their Brows, they make white Strokes, and stick their Faces full of white Spots, which at a di∣stance seem like Pearls. They hang in their Ears Brass and Tin Rings, and put on their Arms, Copper and Ivory Armlets; and on their Legs Rings of Copper. Young unmarri'd Maids wear many small Iron wreath'd Rings on one Arm.</P>
<P>But the chiefest Pride consists in their Shining Teeth, which they pick and rub with a certain piece of Wood, till they become as smooth, clean, and white, as polish'd Ivory.</P>
<P>The People lying near the Shore,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Employment.</NOTE> maintain themselves either by Fishing, Boiling of Salt, Tilling of Land, or Merchandise; as also, by being Factors and Interpreters to those which come out of the Countrey with Gold, to Trade upon the Coasts with the <HI>Whites;</HI> but the Inland, some by Husbandry, others by Trading, many by Plaiting Caps of Bulrushes, or Dogs or <HI>Kabriten</HI> skins. Others Weave Caps, Purses, and Garments of the Peeling of Trees, Painted with all sorts of Colours, and very Artificially made, as though Woven of Flax or Hemp.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Atzyn, Ante, Guaffo, Terra Pekine,</HI> and <HI>Cabo Cors,</HI> maintain themselves by Fishing: Those of <HI>Little-Inkassia,</HI> by Husbandry and Burning of Lime.</P>
<P>They of <HI>Labbede,</HI> though lying near the Sea, make their best livelyhood by keeping of Cattel, and making of Salt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blacks</HI> of the Town <HI>Moure,</HI> use the Fishing Trade, but the chiefest help they have is Merchandize, and to entertain the <HI>Akanists,</HI> which come to them with Gold.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Sabou,</HI> as most of the Inlanders, bestow their whole time and labour in Tilling and Manuring their Fields, whereby in the Town <HI>Moure,</HI> ly∣ing on the Sea-Coast, in the Kingdom of <HI>Sabou,</HI> Provision of <HI>Mille, Injam's,</HI> Fruit, Hens and other things, may be had cheaper than in any other place of the Gold-Coast.</P>
<P>Their manner of Tillage proves very laborious,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Lands are Till'd.</NOTE> being done by the hand, without help either of Horses or Oxen; and besides, they are forc'd to clear the Land of Wood, which cut down to ground, the Stumps and Roots they burn to Ashes, which serve them in stead of Marl, or Dunging.</P>
<P>The Seed-time,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seed-time.</NOTE> with them begins commonly on the twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> in the Rainy-Season, when the Soyl is moistned and become soft; then every man with his whole Family goes into the Field, and takes his best Cloathes and Jewels with him,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are greatly busied.</NOTE> wherewith he adorns his Wife, Children, and Slaves; giving them also plenty of Victuals, with Wine of Palm; in the Evening re∣turning home, follow'd by his Retinue, Singing and Dancing.</P>
<P>The next day they begin to Sow the Land of their King and <HI>Braffo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Land first Till'd.</NOTE> or Captain of the Town under whom they live: for which they are entertain'd with Wine of Palm, boyl'd Mutton, and other Food: afterwards every Man takes care for himself. In the midst of the Field, so soon as the <HI>Mille</HI> springs up, and comes to Blossom, they erect a little wooden Hut, Thatcht with Straw, where they set their Children to keep little Birds out of the Corn.</P>
<P>These People are so Lazy,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Laziness in Til∣ling Land.</NOTE> that seldom any of them will sow more than he shall have need of that Year for his Family; whereupon oftentimes, by ill-thriving
<PB N="457" REF="286"/>of the Grain, caus'd by excessive Drowth, or the multitude of Lo∣custs, there ariseth a great Famine: yet these in certain hazards prevail not to make them more industrious; one reason whereof among other may be, for that none have any propriety in Land, but the King holds all Woods,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">None possesseth any Land of his own.</NOTE> Fields, and Lands, so that none without his leave may Sowe, or Cultivate to his best advantage for improvement.</P>
<P>Every man may take as many Wives as he pleaseth, or can maintain:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> and besides, if he enjoy other women, his Wives may not hinder him from so do∣ing; but he must give every one of them the worth of five or six Shillings to sa∣tisfie and quiet them; whereas on the other side, if the Woman flies out to an∣other man, the Husband may put her away and sell her.</P>
<P>When a young Man hath intention to Marry,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Woeing before Marti∣age.</NOTE> and hath seen a Maid he likes, he requests the Parents to have her to his Wife (which if she be not a Slave) they will easily consent to, especially if the Bride-Gift be offer'd, that is, about a Mark, for the Parents, and as much in two little Cloathes for the Bride, who then is brought to the House with her Companions, who stay there with her for eight days, that the Bridegroom may settle his Affections, and make him∣self acquainted with the Maid.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding that the <HI>Blacks</HI> along this Coast have so many Wives,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every Town keeps two or three Whores.</NOTE> yet in <HI>Atzyn,</HI> and in all the adjoyning Countreys, by Custom, at every Town they keep two or three others, which they call <HI>Abrakrees;</HI> concerning whom the <HI>Cabosero's</HI> have a great Ceremony perform'd in this manner: First they set these Curtizans there with much Laughter and Sport upon a Straw-Mat to show; whereupon one of the eldest among them takes a young Hen, and opens the Bill of it with a Knife, letting some drops of Blood fall upon her Head, Shoulders, and Arms. In the mean time denouncing Death to any of them that shall take for the Hire of their Prostitution above three or four <HI>Kakravens;</HI> all that she gets she must give to the <HI>Cabo-Sero;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>English</HI> Money.</NOTE> for which she hath the liberty to go into any House, and eat without reproof or denial;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Liberty.</NOTE> so may she in the Market, and not be refused upon a great Penalty. When this is done, one of the Company is sent aside with her, who having searched her, and return∣ing testifies her to be a sound Woman: then with the rest of her fellow-Strum∣pets being washed, and sitting down upon a Mat, a Basket of Bread is put into their hands, and Chalk or Sand strowed upon the Shoulders, Arms and Breasts. Lastly, they run into the Town with great mirth and clamor, Dan∣cing; and drinking Wine of Palm, or <HI>Bordon.</HI> The following day they sit upon their setled place, where all that go by must give two or three <HI>Kakroves.</HI></P>
<P>¶ IN Burying the Dead they make great Lamentations and Mournings,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funeral.</NOTE> People of all sorts attending it to the Grave. Persons of Quality are laid in a Chest, others bound in a Mat with their best Garments, and some Or∣naments of Gold, but they take them away as soon as the Corps is laid in the Ground, and lay another Garment or two in the place, with some Goats-Flesh for Food in their Journey to the other World.</P>
<P>When a King, or other great Lord dies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funeral of their Kings.</NOTE> the Funeral concludes with the death of some Slaves, and is done onely to show the Power of the Deceased.</P>
<P>The Women after their Husbands Death are not endow'd of their Estates, but have meerly his Cloathes and Jewels; which also are many times lessen'd by the Man's Bequests in his Life-time.</P>
<P>In the Inheritance of the Crown the Brother succeeds;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Inheritance.</NOTE> or for want of Bro∣thers,
<PB N="458" REF="287"/>the eldest of the Family, without any consideration of the Children: so also private Estates goes to the Brothers, or for want of Brothers, to the Sisters Children; onely at <HI>Akara</HI> the Children Inherit as well the Fathers, as the Mothers Goods.</P>
<P>The Language of this People differs in several places;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Language.</NOTE> for between <HI>Korman∣tyn</HI> and <HI>Akara,</HI> being but fifteen leagues, they have no less than four: but the <HI>Aka∣rists, Kormantyns, Fantyns, Moureans, Minaers, Commondans,</HI> as also those of <HI>Sama,</HI> or <HI>Agitaki,</HI> or <HI>Akitaki, Aquaffo, Fetu, Igwa, Anemabo, Adja, Sabou, Abramboe,</HI> use all one Dialect.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Akara, Ningo,</HI> and <HI>Sinko,</HI> though near Neighbors, yet under∣stand not one anothers Tongue; but all that dwell upon the Shore, or Trade with the <HI>Whites,</HI> speak most of them a mixture of broken <HI>Portuguese, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>French:</HI> yet in all this variety of Tongues, they all are ignorant of Writing, not knowing indeed what a Letter means.</P>
<P>The <HI>English,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchandise.</NOTE> Netherlanders,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> drive great Trade with the <HI>Blacks</HI> upon the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> exchanging their <HI>European</HI> Commodities for Gold, and to that purpose in several places near the richest Trading-Towns, Ledger-Ships, Fa∣ctories, and Forts for the keeping of their Wares, conveniency of Dealing, and against the Intrusion of Enemies. The chiefest Places where Settlements are made, are <HI>Atzyn</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Atzyn,</HI> the Town on <HI>Cabo tres Puntas</HI> in <HI>Lit∣tle Inkassia, Botrow, Takarary, Samo</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Anten, Agitahi,</HI> or <HI>Little Com∣mendo, Daan,</HI> or <HI>Del Myne</HI> in <HI>Guaffo, Moure</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Sabou, Anemabo, Adja, Kormantyn, Fantyn,</HI> and <HI>Akara.</HI></P>

<P>The Clothes which are made at <HI>Cape de Verde,</HI> and along the <HI>Quaqua-Coast,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The most Vendable Commodities.</NOTE> and at <HI>Arder,</HI> are also vented on the <HI>Gold-Coast;</HI> for the best and most desir'd Wares, are Linnen, Cloth, Copperwork, Basons, Kettles, Knives, Ironwork, and Brandy.</P>
<P>Here is generally a certain Rate or Price set upon every Merchandise, in re∣lation to the Gold: as for example, an Hundred twenty and eight Ells of Sleesy Linnen, is oftentimes Apprized at a <HI>Bandy</HI> of Gold; by the <HI>Blacks</HI> call'd <HI>Ta,</HI> and is as much as two Ounces and a half <HI>English,</HI> which reduc'd to Coyn, at four Shil∣lings the Penny Weight, comes to Eight Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>The Sleesy Linen the <HI>Blacks</HI> use for Clothes;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">To what use the <HI>Blacks</HI> put the Wares they buy.</NOTE> the small Cruises to put Oyl in, with which they anoint themselves; but the great ones are set on the Graves and cover'd up; the Barbers Basons to Wash, and Shave themselves withal; the great <HI>Scotch</HI> Pans to kill Pigs or Sheep in, and Dress them in stead of a Trough or Tub; of Iron they make Arms, as <HI>Assagays,</HI> or Launces, Swords, Hewing-Knives, to open the Ground, and cut Wood with. The Yellow, Blew, and Green Cloth, when cut into long Pieces, about a hand broad, make Girdles, wherein they stick their Knives, Poniards, <HI>Benesen,</HI> and such like; the <HI>Venetian</HI> Beads, they wear strung on the Peelings of Trees, about their Necks, Hands, and Feet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maritime Blacks,</HI> serve the Merchants, Strangers, and other <HI>Blacks</HI> which come with Gold out of the Inland Countreys, for Brokers and Inter∣preters, for which they receive a Reward, by them call'd <HI>Dache,</HI> that is, <HI>a Gift,</HI> or <HI>Present.</HI></P>
<P>The time of making a Voyage to this <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> out of <HI>Europe</HI> for Trade,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Navigation.</NOTE> asks no particular season; but may be done all the Year; for where-ever the Ships Arrive, they may Ride at Anchor safe, for which the Ground is very conveni∣ent, being Sand and Clay mix'd together.</P>
<P>For the Weighing of Gold, they have small Scales made of Copper,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold-Weights.</NOTE> with very long Strings, and round, and hollow Weights, like an Orange-Peel.</P>
<P>The People far Upland have Woodden Weights in some, and in other pla∣ces Red, and Black Beans, of which they know exactly how many make such and such Weights of the <HI>Whites.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Akara</HI> they use divers sorts, both of small and great Weights.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Bandy</HI> is 2. Ounces, 8. <HI>Englishes,</HI> or 1d. weight.</NOTE> A great <HI>Ban∣dy,</HI> their heaviest holds out two Ounces and eight Peny Weight, and is by them call'd <HI>Ta;</HI> a small <HI>Bandy</HI> weighs one Ounce and fourteen Peny Weight;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A small <HI>Bandy</HI> is 1 Ounce. 14. <HI>Englishes.</HI> 60. Guilders. 16. Peny Weight in Gold, is an Ounce. 1. Peny Weight in Gold, is, 4.

<P>The Linnen which they Buy they Measure by two Fathom together,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Measure.</NOTE> which cut asunder they call, <HI>Jektam.</HI></P>
<P>They of <HI>Atzin</HI> have but little Trade, by reason the Merchants in their Tra∣vel are often Robb'd and Murder'd on the ways, by the confining People which are under no King nor Government, but each follows his own wick∣ed Inclination, having amongst them neither Law nor Justice: And therefore the Trading Inhabitants Travel thorow the Territories of <HI>Igwyra,</HI> and <HI>Jamou,</HI> both which have setled States, whose Kings, for the benefit of the Custom, keep the Waysfree and clear.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blacks</HI> of <HI>Takorari,</HI> carry themselves very rudely to all <HI>Whites;</HI> they were formerly visited with Sloops and Ketches by the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> for
<PB N="460" REF="288"/>Trade; but finding that their Gold come but in small quantities, it hath been discontinu'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Akanists</HI> have Commerce with the Inhabitants of <HI>Soko,</HI> and bring from thence Clothes, which they Exchange for Ryals of Eight, or other Pieces of Silver; but this very seldom, by reason of the great danger of the Ways, as we mention'd but lately: however such as do venture, and make a safe Journey, gain great Riches by the aforemention'd Clothes.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sama</HI> the <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Factory, and Trade with the People of <HI>Adom</HI> and <HI>Wassa</HI> for the same Wares that were wont to be Vented at <HI>Ante, viz.</HI> Iron, Says, Course Linnen, Seamens Knives, Beads, old Sheets, and such like.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Ante</HI> have some Gold brought to them from <HI>Egwyra</HI> and <HI>Mompa,</HI> but are hindred from improving their Trade by the Wars of the <HI>Antinars</HI> against those of <HI>Adom.</HI></P>
<P>Before <HI>Little Commendo,</HI> formerly on the Sea, was a great Trade driven by the <HI>English,</HI> but since the <HI>Dutch</HI> won the Castle <HI>De Myne,</HI> 'tis remov'd thither; onely at <HI>Commendo,</HI> upon the Kings intreaty, a Store-house is built, and fur∣nish'd with all sorts of Goods, but cannot draw thither much Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Cabo Cors</HI> for some years had repute for the chiefest Place of Trade on the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> but of late so decay'd, that scarce any shew of it remains: yet still the Merchants keep a Store-house there to furnish the Inhabitants, and those that come daily from <HI>Fetu</HI> thither to Market.</P>
<P>These <HI>Blacks,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Blacks</HI> are cunning in falsifying their Gold.</NOTE> as they have good Judgment, and can quickly see if the Gold be good or not, so they know by a peculiar Art, to falsifie and embase that which they intend to give to the <HI>Whites,</HI> in divers manners.</P>
<P>Most of their Cheats they practice in their Gilded Arm-Rings, which they mix with Copper, as likewise among other pieces of Gold, and cannot be di∣stinguish'd from the Gold, when newly Clipt, but grow commonly Rusty and Pale, having lay'n some time amongst the Gold: the best proof they make by Strong-Waters.</P>
<P>Their melted Gold (which Art of Melting they have learn'd from the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>) they falsifie with two much red Copper, or Silver mixt amongst it; for without one of these two the Gold will not Run. This is a Cheat very common and usual among those of <HI>Fantyn.</HI></P>
<P>They have yet another Trick, to cover Silver and red Copper over with Gold, so as not to be discover'd unless you cut it.</P>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Portuguese</HI> us'd to punish the <HI>Blacks</HI> very severely, if they brought but one Peny-weight of falsifi'd Gold to sell, without any respect of Persons.</P>
<P>The Gold as it comes out of the Myne, without Melting or Refining, is ta∣ken for the best, that is, when the Sand, or Dust is meerly Sifted out: Besides, one Myne affords much better Gold than another; for the deeper they fetch up the Gold, the worse it proves, being spoil'd by too much Quick-Silver.</P>
<P>Amongst the Gold brought from the upper Places of this Coast, that of <HI>Atzyn</HI> and <HI>Adom</HI> bears the Credit as the best, because 'tis observ'd, that the Peo∣ple Melt it without falsifying.</P>
<P>The <HI>Akanists</HI> bring most melted Gold, which is taken for good; but they must be narrowly inspected, for they are ingenious at Gilding.</P>
<P>The <HI>Akaras</HI> Gold hath a good repute for Purity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Akaras</HI> Gold is the best.</NOTE> if the Dust the quite blown from it.</P>
<PB N="461" REF="288"/>
<P>They have no Coyn amongst them;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is no Coyn.</NOTE> but the Subjects pay Tribute in weighed Gold; but if it be a small Parcel under any Weight, then they pay one another with Pieces of melted Gold, as big as Pins-heads cut four-square,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kakraven.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Kakraven;</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese, Denier</HI> and <HI>Pai,</HI> being about a Grain, or less. This invention the <HI>Portuguese</HI> taught them first; for before their arrival the <HI>Blacks</HI> knew nothing of them: but they finding neither Coyn, nor any small Weight of Gold for to pay, when they bought Fruit, or any other Provision, thought on this way of Payment in stead of single Mo∣ney: since which time, all along the Coast, an infinite number of these Pie∣ces may had; when the other <HI>Blacks,</HI> where the <HI>Whites</HI> are not known, use no such, but sell their Gold as it comes from the Earth: for in stead of Coyn or Money to pay one another in small Sums, the People of <HI>Akara</HI> have little Iron Spikes, or Crosses of a Finger long, with a Half-Moon on the top.</P>
<P>When they go to the Wars they Paint their Faces, Breasts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> and whole Bodies, with yellow, white, and red Colours, and make upon it Crosses, Snakes, and such like, hanging a round Ring, made of the Branches of Trees, as thick as an Arm, about their Neck in stead of a Corslet, to keep off the blows of their Cutting-Knives, and set on their Heads Caps like a Helmet, made of Crocodiles, or Leopards-Skins, adorn'd with red Parrots Feathers, and before with two or four Horns. The Grandees wear a Garland of Elephants, or Sea-Horses Teeth: About their Bodies they have a Leathern Girdle, that comes betwixt their Legs, with a small Cloth before their Privacies; and in the Gir∣dle they stick a Knife, or Ponyard, whose Sheaths are made of Dogs, or Buck-Skins, adorn'd with a great red Shell of a Hand breadth on the top. The common Soldiers use great Chopping-Knives, broad at the ends, and small; and in stead of a Handle they adorn it with a Bone of an Ape or Tyger, which they stick at one side of their Girdle.</P>
<P>Their other Arms are Darts, Shields, <HI>Assagays,</HI> or Lances, and two-edged Swords, with Handles of the Bones of Lions, Tygers, and other dangerous Beasts, Knobb'd at the ends, and cover'd with a Plate of Gold, or with Skins of Fish. Their <HI>Assagays,</HI> or Lances, Darts, Arrows, and Bowes, have several other fashions; but mostare Tipt at both ends, with Iron of an equal weight, that in the throwing, they may flie level.</P>
<P>Their Shields are commonly six Foot long, and four broad, made of Mat∣work, or Wood, in manner of a four square Tray, bow'd inward, having in the midst a Wooden, Iron, or Copper Cross, which they hold by. Some per∣sons of State, cover their Shields with Tygers Skins, and put an Iron or Cop∣per Plate above that, two Foot long, and one broad. The Bowes are of streight, hard, and tough Wood, and the Strings made of the Peeling of Trees; the Ar∣rows, at one end, in stead of Feathers, have a rough Dogs Skin drawn half over them; and at the other, a small Head Poyson'd: but they may not carry such Poyson'd Arrows, except in the Wars against their Enemies.</P>
<P>Their Drums are of two sorts, one made of hollow Trees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drums.</NOTE> drawn over with a Goats Skin, being very deep; whereupon with Drum-Sticks, like Pestels, they Beat when the King keeps a Feast, for they lie commonly before the Kings, or Captains house. The others made also of hollow Trees, but smaller, round above, and sharp beneath like a Top, which they hang about their Necks; and therewith, after their attendance is ended, they go about Drumming; which they use to none but the Nobility.</P>
<P>Their Trumpets, or Horns, cut out of Elephants Teeth, finely Striped,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Trumpets, or Horns.</NOTE>
<PB N="462" REF="289"/>with a square Hole in the middle or end, wherein they blow; but none may have these but the King, or Captain.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> lying near the Sea, know also pretty well how to use Guns dexterously, which they learnt from the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>Those of the Town <HI>Myne,</HI> use now for the most part Musquets: In casting of Lances, or <HI>Assagays,</HI> they have such a sleight, that they will hit the White, though no bigger than a Sixpence, standing some Paces distant. They never fight but with continual Drumming, and Sounding the Horn. The Prisoners on both sides they make Slaves, and Feast in some places upon the Slain, making Drinking-Cups of their Skulls.</P>
<P>In Drawing out to Fight they keep no Order,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They fight without order.</NOTE> but all run together, falling on furiously, with great Cries and Shreekings; in which Service all are bound to follow the King, saving onely, very old Men, and Youths under eighteen or twenty years of Age.</P>
<P>The Victor uses great Cruelty against the other, cutting off their Heads, sparing neither Women, or Children, and triumphing therewith two or three weeks together, continually Chanting forth their own Praises, and whatever may tend to the dishonor of the Enemy; and this Custom hath been practised not onely here, but too frequently in other parts of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings have here absolute Command,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Command and De∣minion of the King.</NOTE> and Govern according to their own wills, their little Territories: and although in outward appearance, the Subjects seem not to give that Honor and Respect as befits them, nor them∣selves to take such State as is proper for them; yet they do (as we said) what they please, Burning, and Destroying, Placing, and Displacing, as Fancy, Humor, or Anger moves them. They alone make War, and Peace, nor dare the justest or most bold Magistrates punish the Villanies of their Retainers.</P>
<P>All the Towns lying near the Sea, are every one Govern'd by a Captain, or <HI>Braffo,</HI> and <HI>Kaboseros,</HI> or Chief Officers, appointed in the Kings Name.</P>
<P><HI>Fidalgo's,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">There are many of the Nobility.</NOTE> or Noble Persons, the King makes in too great abundance, con∣sidering the smallness of their Ability, and Means to live on, which are dimi∣nish'd also by the Purchase of their Honour. Now it is to be observ'd, that by three Gifts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are made.</NOTE> any man may attain to the degree of Nobility; that is, of a Dog, a Sheep, and a Cow, together with some other things of less consequence; as Wine of Palm, and Brandy Wine: so that this Honour, <HI>viis &amp; modis,</HI> costs them near a Hundred Markes, and distributed in this manner: First he buys for those that undertake to recommend his cause to the <HI>Braffo,</HI> or Captain of the Town, a Cow, whereto all the Nobility are invited, and without fail appear at the set-time, Drest in the best Attire, to help to order the Feast, and to shew Feats of Activity and Mirth. In the mean time, the new Nobleman having made all ready to entertain his Guests, sends to another <HI>Fidalgo,</HI> a Hen, and a Pot of <HI>Palmito</HI>-Wine to his house. On the Feast-day, all the Inhabitants of the Town come together, and go to the upper end of the Market, provided with all sorts of playing Instruments for their Sports; as Drums, Horns, Bells, and other devises, to whom the <HI>Braffo</HI> joyns, accompany'd with many Youths Arm'd with Shields and Spears, or Lances; and their Faces Painted with Red and Yellow Oker.</P>
<P>At last comes the new made <HI>Fidalgo,</HI> into the company of the other Noble∣men, with a young Man Attendant, carrying a Stool after him, upon which he seats himself; when presently his Fellows wish him good luck, pulling a handful of Straw out of the Roof, and lay under his Feet; then address them∣selves
<PB N="463" REF="289"/>to tender their Civilities to his Wife, tying up her Hair with many Gol∣den <HI>Fetissies,</HI> and Crosses, having about her Neck a Gold Chain; and putting in one of her hands a Horses Tail, and on the right Arm a Gold Ring, with a broad <HI>Pendulum</HI> of Gold, like a Potlid: thus Attir'd and Attended with many other Women, they follow the beforemention'd Cow through the Market, Singing and Dancing, till return'd into the same place; the Men make strange Sport, Drumming, Dancing, Fencing, Singing and Leaping about them: At last they carry them through the Town upon a Stool, casting Meal in their Faces; thus their exorbitant Pastimes continue till Evening, and then the other Nobles conduct them to their usual Habitations.</P>
<P>The next day, (for this Solemnity continues three) they spend as the former.</P>
<P>On the third, the Executioner Slaughters the Cow, and cuts it into four Quarters, of which every one has a piece given; but the Instituters of the Feast may not Eat thereof, as conceited, that if they did, they should die with∣in the Year.</P>
<P>During the Feast a white Flag stands upon his House in token of Joy, and an open Court; and after the Solemnity ended, the Head of the Cow is brought to his House, Painted with many Colours, and hang'd about with Wisps of Straw, and Devices, in token or confirmation of his Nobility; whereby he hath gain'd great Freedom and Priviledges: for now he may buy Slaves, and Trade for other things, which before he had no permission to do. They take great care therefore about it, although perhaps the acquiring cost them all they are worth, and thereby are much poorer than before: but he soon gets it up again by Presents brought him from others, each according to his ability. And now as soon as he hath gain'd an Estate again, he bestows it upon Slaves, wherein their Riches and Reputation consists.</P>
<P>These keep one among another a yearly time of Feasting; where they make good Cheer, new Paint the Cows Head, and hang it about with Ears of <HI>Mille.</HI> Besides this, the Nobility in general keep one Feast upon the sixth day of <HI>July;</HI> where they Paint their Bodies with Stripes of red Earth, and wear on their Necks a Garland of green Boughs and Straw, as a Badge of their Nobility. In the Evening they all come as Guests to the House of the <HI>Braffo;</HI> where they are entertain'd with exceeding Mirth and Feasting, even to Excess and Drunkenness.</P>
<P>These People are so conceited of their old Idolatrous Customs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion, or Worship.</NOTE> that they deride, as it were, the Religion of the <HI>Whites,</HI> under what Name or Notion so∣ever. Several times have the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> by Jesuits sent thither, en∣deavour'd to convert them to the Christian Faith, yet never have been able hi∣therto to effect any thing worth relating. And thus have we travell'd through the <HI>Gold-Coast.</HI></P>

<P>The Women are so addicted to Dancing,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kind of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> that they cannot forbear upon the hearing of any Instrument, though they be loaden with one Child in their Belly, and another at their Backs, where they commonly carry them.</P>
<P>Both Men and Women keep their Bodies very clean, washing every morn∣ing and evening; the Women anoint themselves usually with Civet, and other sweet smelling Herbs and Plants, to seem the more acceptable to their Hus∣bands.</P>
<P>When a young Man intends to put himself into a Marry'd condition, and hath observ'd a Maid that pleases his eye, instantly he seeks to make acquain∣tance with her, which hath no difficulty, because of the great freedom they have; by which means it happens often, that a mean young Man, gets a No∣blemans Daughter; and if they agree between themselves, the Marriage is concluded, without need of acquainting the Parents on either side.</P>
<P>A Nobleman may Marry as many Wives as he pleaseth, and every year, over and above, gets two or three of his Companions Daughters, eight or ten years old, who serve him as Naked as they came from their Mothers Womb, till he enjoys them, and then they obtain a little Garment on, and are esteem'd for Women.</P>
<P>The confirmation of the Marriage, is, by giving two or three little Clothes by the Bride-groom to the Bride, and seven or eight Pots of Drink; to the Friends and Neighbours to make merry with.</P>
<P>A Common Man, as before is declar'd, may Marry as many Wives as he can keep; yet for all that they run a Whoring, and must not be found fault with; but if a Woman go Astray, the Man may reject or sell her; so that hereby it seems,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conditions of the Women.</NOTE> that they are much subjected to their Husbands, yet they are inclin'd to Wantonness, wherein they neglect no opportunities to satiate their Lusts; and this causes in many, an absolute sterility; in others, a seldom pre∣gnancy, so that they have but few Children; perhaps, two or three in their whole lives: if some happen to have eight, or ten, they win infinite respect,
<PB N="467" REF="291"/>both from the Husband and other Friends; whereas the Barren are despis'd by all: and although they love multiplicity of Children by one Woman, yet they question that Womans honesty, that has more than one at a Birth.</P>
<P>At Funerals they have many solemn Ceremonies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funeral.</NOTE> for all the Neighborhood attend; and the Nobleman, in whose Precinct the Deceas'd formerly liv'd, gives Clothes to wind up the Corps in, which is then laid in a Vault of his own Dwelling-house, bravely Hang'd with Mats.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Merchandise.</NOTE> whither they bring several Commodities, to exchange for Slaves, Cotton Clothes, and <HI>Akori:</HI> but the readiest Merchandise which the <HI>Blacks</HI> Barter for here, are little Horns, call'd <HI>Bousiers,</HI> found under the Islands of <HI>Maldivi's,</HI> and brought over out of <HI>Goa,</HI> and <HI>Kochin</HI> in stead of Ballast: but it happens sometimes, that the <HI>Bousiers</HI> are hard to be gotten, and dear, every Pound worth Four Shillings; and then, in stead of them, other Wares are brought thither, especially fine Red Beads: but when the Trade is manag'd with <HI>Bousiers,</HI> they Barter usually one third part of <HI>Bousiers,</HI> and two third parts of other Merchandise.</P>

<P>Four or five Miles from <HI>Ba,</HI> by a great Tree, a free Market is kept every day, where the Inhabitants, sometimes to the number of three or four thou∣sand, come with all sorts of Commodities.</P>
<PB N="468" REF="292"/>
<P>When the Merchants Land at <HI>Arder,</HI> they are brought to the King, where they must give an account of their Trading to him in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Tongue: for none may Trade there before he hath first offer'd his Goods to the King, that, as he says, his Subjects might not have the best Merchandise, and he the course; besides this, they must give to the King for a Present, a Lump of fine Coral, six Pieces of Cypress Cloathes, three of <HI>Maurisses,</HI> and one of Diaper: yet nevertheless the <HI>Whites</HI> must seem to set out the best Wares, as Silk, and the like, uppermost; though generally they conceal better, because then the Sub∣jects must have the worst onely; which would not be for the Merchants pro∣fit: however, as we said, they must seem to correspond.</P>
<P>After the delivery of the Silk Wares, and some other sleighter, yet in the King's Court several Presents must be given to his Son; to the <HI>Foella,</HI> or Captain of the <HI>Whites;</HI> to the Porters, or Door-keepers; and to divers other of the Courtiers.</P>
<P>After leave obtain'd from the King to Trade, all the Nobility conduct the <HI>Whites</HI> off to the Stock-fish Town, lying a Mile from the South-West Shore, where a convenient place is appointed for them to Truck for Slaves.</P>
<P>But for liberty to Trade for <HI>Akory</HI> they must pay more, forty Pieces of yellow Armlets, twenty Hens, a <HI>Cabriet,</HI> or Sheep, besides other things to those that make Proclamation, that every one that will Trade with the <HI>Whites,</HI> may now do it freely.</P>
<P>The Wages for carrying the Merchandise to the King, is two yellow Rings, for a Chest or Pack carri'd by two Men; and four, for what four Men carry.</P>
<P>As soon as they come to Land, there must be something given to the <HI>Honga,</HI> or Captain of the Boat; for which he must be ready at all times with his Boat on the Shore for fear of any mishap, to preserve Goods and People; be∣cause by the beating of the Sea against the Shore, the Landing proves very dangerous.</P>
<P>When the Merchants have done, and are ready to depart, they must pay to the King two Musquets, and five and twenty Pound of Gun-Powder, or for want of that, in Silk-Worms, the worth of nine Slaves; to the <HI>Carte,</HI> to the <HI>Foello,</HI> or Captain of the <HI>Whites,</HI> and to <HI>Honga</HI> the Captain of the Boat, to each of them a like Present.</P>
<P>Provisions for the <HI>Whites</HI> may be had here for a reasonable Price, that is, a Cask of fresh Water, and a Sag of Wood, for two yellow Armlets; a Kof, or Chest of Salt, for three; five Hens, for four; a Pot of Beer, for one.</P>
<P>In time of Wars none are exempted from Service,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wars.</NOTE> but very old Men and Children; their disorderly manner of Fight you have before describ'd, as also their Barbarism to the Slain and Prisoners, and Method of Triumphing with their Heads; and therefore we will not here repeat, and cloy you with the same things again.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Arder</HI> hath absolute and Soveraign Power over his Subjects,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dominion.</NOTE> and according as they reckon State, carries a Majestick Splendor, both in Clothes and Servants, his Subjects tendring him great respect: He Creates Noblemen and Courtiers at his pleasure, and punishes Offenders, not any daring to con∣tradict.</P>
<P>Every Town, as <HI>Jakkijn</HI> and <HI>Ba,</HI> hath their <HI>Fidalgos</HI> or Noblemen to preside it, in the King's Name, who exacts a great Revenue from the Inhabitants, by Or∣der from the King.</P>
<P>When the King dies,

<PB N="469" REF="292"/>him, and some Servants are Strangled, as an ostentation of Power, not in ex∣pectation of Service in the other world.</P>
<P>The Crown descends to the Eldest or Youngest Son, after their Fathers De∣cease, and takes all his Father left, but his Wives, whom all but his own Mo∣ther, to whom extraordinary respect is shown, he imploys in his works of se∣veral kinds.</P>
<P>The Goods of the meanest sort, after their decease, falls to the Noblemen, whose Vassals they were.</P>
<P>Their Religion consists in no appointed Meetings, or setled Form,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Religion.</NOTE> though they have <HI>Fetiseros</HI> or Priests; for every Person of Quality hath his own Chap∣lain, and if any be sick in their Family, the <HI>Fetisero</HI> comes, and taking Oxen,

<P>Every Family hath a Meeting once in six moneths, at which, their Priest offers Sacrifice to their <HI>Fetisi</HI> or <HI>Sant,</HI> put under a Pot with Holes; and then they enquire of what they desire to know: If the <HI>Fetisi</HI> be unsatisfied, the Priest can get no words from him; if otherwise, he hath an answer by a gracile, or small-piped voice, (as if it came from the <HI>Fetisi,</HI> whereas, indeed it is a counter∣feited sound by their Priests:) Then the Inquirer takes a Bason, fill'd with Beer and Meal, and gives to the Priest; then suddenly, somewhat in the Pot, under which the <HI>Fetisi</HI> sits, leaps; whereupon all promising obedience to the answer, and drinking a draught out of the Bason, depart.</P>
<P>They believe another life after this, but not for all; for they say, that a man after death, perisheth, and his bloud congeals; so that none must expect any Resurrection, saving those that are slain in the Wars, which they averre to have found by experience; and that the Bodies slain in the Wars, lie not two days in the Graves. But more probably, this seems a cheat of their <HI>Fetisero's,</HI> who in the night, steal the bodies from their resting-places, to make the people believe they were risen, and gone to another life; and to this end, to make them the more stout and valiant in the Wars.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders of the Kingdom of <HI>Benyn.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Benin,</HI> so call'd, from its chief City <HI>Great Be∣nyn;</HI> borders in the Northwest, on the Kingdom of <HI>Ulkami, Jaboc, Je∣jago,</HI> and <HI>Oedobo;</HI> in the North, on that of <HI>Jaboc,</HI> eight days journey above the City <HI>Benyn;</HI> in the East, on the Kingdom of <HI>Istanna,</HI> and <HI>Forkado;</HI> and in the South, on the Sea.</P>
<P>How far this Principality of <HI>Benyn</HI> spreads,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigness.</NOTE> from South to North, is as yet unknown, by reason several places continue so full of great Woods, that they cannot be Travell'd; but it hath from East to West about a hundred <HI>Spanish</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>This Kingdom boast many good Towns,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Latb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> though little at present known, as lying eight or nine days journey beyond the City of <HI>Benyn;</HI> besides an innu∣merable number of Villages and Hamlets, sprinkled as Beauty-Spots on the Verge of the River; but the rest of the Countrey, not Inhabited, so overgrown with Brambles, and Bushes, as makes it unpassable, save onely where some nar∣row Paths lead from Town to Town.</P>
<P>Twenty miles or thereabouts, up the same River, near its Head-Spring, stands a Town call'd <HI>Gotton,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gotton.</NOTE> considerable for its length and extent.</P>
<P>Nine or ten miles from which,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Benyn.</HI></NOTE> but more into the Countrey Northward, <HI>Benyn</HI> shews its self; a City of that largeness, as cannot be equall'd in those Parts, and of greater civility than to be expected among such Barbarous Peo∣ple; to whom better known by the name of <HI>Ordor.</HI></P>
<P>It confines within the proper Limits of its own Walls three miles;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigness.</NOTE> but ta∣king in the Court makes as much more. The Wall upon one side rises to the height of ten Feet, double Pallasado'd with great and thick Trees, with Spars of five or six Foot, laid Crossways, fasten'd together, and Plaister'd over with Red Clay, so that the whole is cemented into one intirely; but this surrounds hardly one side; the other side having onely a great Trench, or Ditch, and Hedge of Brambles, unpassable, with little less difficulty than a Wall, and con∣sequently a good Defence.</P>
<P>The Gates,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength.</NOTE> being eight or nine Foot high, and five broad, and made of one whole Piece of Wood, hang, or rather turns on a Pin, in the middle, being the fashion of that Countrey.</P>
<P>The King's Palace is Quadrangular,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Court.</NOTE> standing on the right hand of the City, as you enter at the Gate from <HI>Gotton,</HI> of no less compass than it, and in like manner surrounded; sub-divided into several stately Courts, Houses, and Apartements in the Countries; containing within fair and long Galleries, one larger than the other, but all supported on Pillars of Wood, cover'd from the top to the bottom with melted Copper, whereon are Ingraven their War∣like Deeds and Battels, and are kept with exceeding Curiosity. Most of the Roofs of this Palace are cover'd with Palm Canes, and every corner adorn'd with a Turret, rising high with a Spire, on whose tops, as we do here, place

<PB N="471" REF="295"/>Fanes; so they set Birds with out-stretched Wings very Artificially.</P>
<P>The City hath thirty very Strait and Broad Streets, each a hundred and twenty Foot wide, from one side of the Houses to the other; from which, by several smaller cross Lanes or Passages, you may go to any part within the Walls.</P>
<P>The Houses stand built in Rows, in good order close by one another,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> as here in <HI>Europe,</HI> having slop'd Roofs, cover'd with Palm Canes; they seldom exceed one Story, but of great capaciousness, with long Galleries, and many Chambers, Traverses, and Apartments, especially the Houses of the Nobility; and all the Partitions made of red Earth, with great Art and Beauty, which by washing and rubbing they keep Smooth, Bright, and Shining as a Looking-Glass; of the same matters are the Cielings made: In short, the Houses are neat∣ly Built here, beyond those of all other places in this Countrey, and every one furnisht with a convenient Well of pure and fresh Water.</P>
<P>A days journey Eastward of <HI>Benyn,</HI> lieth the Village <HI>Koffo.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Koffo.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Countrey appears low and full of Wood, in some places beautifi'd by Rivers and great Lakes; but between <HI>Gotton</HI> and great <HI>Benyn,</HI> the King hath ap∣pointed certain Officers to supply the necessities of all Travellers in what they want; for whose more fitting Accommodation, great Pots full of cool and pleasant Water, clear as Crystal, with Drinking-Horns near them, are set by the way side; yet none dares take it without paying the appointed Price.</P>
<P>Among other Rivers that run through this Territory,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio Benyn.</NOTE> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Arbo;</HI> and by the <HI>Whites, Rio de Benyn,</HI> seems the best: It lieth eighteen miles Eastwardly from <HI>Rio Lagos,</HI> and with a broad and wide Mouth, enters the Sea: It hath a pretty convenient coming for Ketches and Slopes, but up∣ward, grows more narrow and crooked, dividing into many lesser Branches.</P>
<P>Here grow exceeding variety of Plants, and Fruits; as Oranges, Lemmons, and the like.</P>
<P>There grows also Pepper, call'd <HI>Benyn Pepper,</HI> but not in any quantity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE> and very often it grows like that of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> but smaller; and Cotton in great abundance, whereof the Inhabitants make very fine Clothes.</P>
<P>Here breed divers sorts of Wild and Tame Beasts; as Tygers, Leopards,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> wild Board, Harts, Civet and wild Cats, Elephants, Horses, Asses, Goats, and Sheep, which have no Wooll, but Hair, onely long Legs, and well tasted flesh; besides many sorts of Squirrels, Land-Tortoises, Serpents, and the like; and of Fowls, Parrets, Pigeons, Pheasants, Storks, Turtle-Doves, and other great Birds; as Ostriches, and many others.</P>
<P>The Rivers feed Crocodiles, and very large Sea-Horses;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishes.</NOTE> also divers kinds of Fish, among the rest, a certain small one, which if touch'd by any, causes a quaking and trembling in the Arm, and therefore call'd, <HI>The Quaking-Fish,</HI> perhaps the <HI>Torpedo</HI> of <HI>Pliny.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants are all fashionable people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cordition of the In∣habitants.</NOTE> excelling other <HI>Blacks</HI> of this Coast, living together under good Laws and Justice; and shewing to all Fo∣raigners which Trade upon their Coast, great courtesie.</P>
<P>Their Cloathing, much like those of <HI>Arder;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their constitution.</NOTE> for persons of Ability wear two, three, or four Garments, one shorter than another, so pink'd, that the undermost appeareth through the upper; but the Common People have scarce one to cover their naked Bodies.</P>
<P>The Women have a blue Cloth from the middle, reaching below the Knee,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clothing.</NOTE> and some small covering over their Breasts; their Hair neatly ty'd up, and
<PB N="472" REF="296"/>Pleited on the Crown of the Head like a Garland, the one half of a black, the other of a red colour, with Brass Rings on their Arms.</P>
<P>No man may go Clothed to, or in the Court, unless the King appoint him his Habit; insomuch that there are Men in the Palace of twenty, or twenty four years of Age, who go stark naked, without any sign of shame, onely with a Chain of fine Coral or Jasper about their Necks. But when the King gives them Garments, and together with them a Wife, ever after they always go Cloathed, and wash their Hair, which never grows to such length as to need cutting. Neither may the Women put on any Cloathes, till given by her Husband; so that Women of twenty, and five and twenty years old run along the Streets stark naked without shame or rebuke: but when the Husband hath once Suited her, he causes a House to be made for her, and sleeps by her, as by his other Wives.</P>
<P>Every Man Marries as many Women as he desires,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> yet keeps besides a great number of Concubines: But a <HI>White</HI> or a <HI>Christian</HI> may not be permitted to keep a Girl, because forbidden on pain of Death.</P>
<P>The Woman that hath had a Son by her deceased Husband,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Widow is a Woman-Servant to her Son.</NOTE> may not Mar∣ry again, but must be a Slave to her Son. Now if it happen, that any Man have a mind to such a Widow, he sues to the Son for her, promising to give him another young Maid in her stead, which must continue his Slavess as long as he please.</P>
<P>If the Parents bestow not their Daughter in Marriage before twelve or fourteen years of Age, after that time they have nothing more to do with her.</P>
<P>All the Women that after the death of the Husband admit another into their private Embraces, fall to the King, whom he bestows in Marriage; but such as keep themselves more reserv'd, the Son claims, and bestows upon re∣quest, as we have said already.</P>
<P>Sometimes the King doth not bestow these Women in Marriage again, but makes <HI>Regetairs,</HI> or Nurses of them. These, considering they need not stand in fear of a Husband, chuse as many single Men as they like, to whom they prostitute themselves at pleasure: and when any of them prove with Child, and bear a Son, they are free from paying of Tribute; but if they have a Girl, it becomes the King's due to dispose of.</P>
<P>There are great <HI>Regetairs,</HI> to whom the inferior give a yearly account, as they again to the great <HI>Fiadores,</HI> or Treasurers of the Empire, who declare the same to the King onely.</P>
<P>No Man may sleep with his Wife when she hath lay'n in Childbed, before the Child is a year and a half old: but she knows well enough how to play her Game in the mean time with others; of which if the Husband get any knowledge, he complains to the <HI>Fiadoors.</HI></P>
<P>There are no Twins found,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why there are no Twins.</NOTE> though likely enough that some are born; yet conceal'd with all care possible by the Midwife, because they count the bearing of two Children at a Birth, a great shame to a Woman.</P>
<P>They bury their Dead with all their Cloathes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funeral.</NOTE> and kill certain Slaves to serve them in the other World; after which they spend some days with Dan∣cing and Playing about the Grave: nay they sometimes dig the Corps up again, to honour him with new Sacrifices both of Men and Beasts. When a Woman dies, her Friends take Pots, Pans, Chests, and Boxes, and go with them upon their Heads along the Streets, with the sound of Drums and other Instru∣ments,
<PB N="473" REF="296"/>Singing to the honour of the Deceased. And according to her Degree and State, kill at the Grave some Slaves, and set near the Corps; so that no person of ability dies there, but the Funeral is attended with much expence of humane Blood.</P>
<P>Concerning Inheritance,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inheritance.</NOTE> the Husband takes all the Goods the Wife leaves behind her, except what she hath given her Children, while living; whereas the Woman may not, after the decease of her Husband, take the least part, be∣cause they all, as well Wives, Slaves, as other Goods, fall to the King; who for the most part, if there be a Son, bestows them on him.</P>
<P>No Foreigners can Trade up the River of <HI>Benyn</HI> without Order of the King; who chuses one <HI>Fiadoor,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchandise.</NOTE> or Councellor of the Kingdom to Treat and Trade with them: Neither may those appointed for the Trade, so much as converse with the <HI>Whites,</HI> or come into their Store-houses, much less buy any <HI>European</HI> Wares, but are constrain'd to take them at the dearest rate of the <HI>Fia∣doors.</HI> On the other side, no <HI>Fiadoor,</HI> or Steward, may deal for any thing that belongeth to the Wars; so that every one must keep himself within the bounds of his Office.</P>
<P>When a Ship with its Lading Toweth along the Shore, a Messenger,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When a new Ships La∣ding comes, <HI>Fiadoors</HI> are sent to <HI>Gotton.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Passadoor,</HI> is sent to acquaint the King with it; who immediately dispatches two or three <HI>Fiadoors,</HI> accompani'd with twenty or thirty <HI>Veelies</HI> that are Mer∣chants, to go down and Trade with the <HI>Whites:</HI> These with great diligence go over-Land from <HI>Benyn</HI> to <HI>Gotton,</HI> where they Press as many <HI>Canoos</HI> as they want. Being thus arriv'd and provided of Boats, they chuse the best Houses and Dwellings, and without asking the Owner's leave, bring in all their Goods, turning him to shift for his Family; and yet he is bound the first day to Cook their Meat for them, without having any recompence for his pains.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Fiadoors</HI> come the first time into the Store-houses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Fiadoors</HI> wel∣come the <HI>Whites.</HI></NOTE> they have neat Habits, with a Chain of Jasper about their Necks, and so kneeling, present the Salutation from their King and his Mother, and the greatest <HI>Fiadoors,</HI> in whose Name they bring somewhat to eat, ceremoniously enquiring of the state of their Countrey, Wars against their Enemies, and such like: so after a small Re∣past and Entertainment they take their leave, without speaking of Merchan∣dise; and the next day they return, asking to see the new-come Merchandise, which is shew'd them. Such Goods as they have brought of before, continue at the set Price; but new Goods have a Price set upon them: and when they have beat down Commodities as low as they can, and the Market set, they go on to Trade.</P>
<P>The Commodities,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Benynish</HI>-Wares.</NOTE> which the <HI>Europeans</HI> and other <HI>Whites</HI> Trade for in the River of <HI>Benyn,</HI> are Cotton-Cloathes, Jasper-Stone, and Women-Slaves, Leo∣pard-Skins, some Pepper and <HI>Akori,</HI> which is a certain bluish Coral,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Akori</HI> is a kind of blue Coral.</NOTE> growing like a Tree in the Water. This <HI>Akori,</HI> carried to the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> the Women wear for an Ornament in their Hair.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants call the before-mention'd Cloathes <HI>Mouponoqua,</HI> being made of Cotton-Yarn, either all blue, or Strip'd with white and blue, two Ells and a half, and two Ells three quarters long, and scarce two Ells broad. And the other smaller, three of which make a Garment <HI>Ambasis.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Whites</HI> give in Exchange for these Cloathes, such and the like Wares following:
<PB N="474" REF="297"/>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Cloth of Gold and Silver.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Red Cloth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Canvas, strip'd with red at one end.</ITEM>
<ITEM>All sorts of fine Cotton.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Linnen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Confection of Oranges and Lemons, and other green Fruits.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Crimson Velvet.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Brass Armlets, each of five ounces and a half.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lavender, and Violet Cotton-Seed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Course Kersies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fine Coral.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Flower'd Stuffs, and stiff Gumm'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Red Glass Pendants for the Ears.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Iron Staves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Gilt Looking-Glasses.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Crystals.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>East-India</HI> little Horns, or Shells, which they use in stead of Money.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The greater Strip'd Cloathes, transported to the <HI>Gold-Coast,</HI> have a good and quick Vent; but those that are all blue, are sold for most advantage in the River of <HI>Gabon</HI> in <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>Every three or four days, in the Town of <HI>Gotton,</HI> a Market is kept, to which those of <HI>Great Benyn, Arbon,</HI> and other Towns round about, repair; where not onely the aforesaid Cloathes, but all sorts of Provisions may be had.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Benyn</HI> have for their own use other Cloathes, made in <HI>Coffo,</HI> a Town lying a days Journey Eastward from thence; but no <HI>Whites</HI> may come there.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Gotton</HI> and <HI>Benyn</HI> great Plains spread themselves, wherein on Set-Days rich and plentiful Markets are found, extraordinarily crowded by all sorts of Dealers.</P>
<P>All Differences arising about Trade, the Nobility decide; for the Judges of the Place meddle not, so long as any remain there that belong to the King.</P>
<P>Their Arms are Shields,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms, or Weapons.</NOTE> Spears, Bowes, Lances, or <HI>Assagays,</HI> and empoy∣son'd Arrows, which the <HI>Fetisero's,</HI> or <HI>Devil-Hunters,</HI> prepare very artificially. The Nobility, when they go to the Wars, Cloathe themselves in Scarlet, as a Badge of Eminency; others have Gorgets of Elephants and Leopard-Teeth, and high red Caps, Wrought and Quilted with Leopards and Civet-Cat Skins; unto which hangs a long Horse Tail for Ornament.</P>
<P>The common Soldiers usually go with the upper part of their Body naked, but on the lower wear a Cloth as fine as Silk.</P>
<P>In Fighting they keep a good Discipline and Order, for none may stir from his Place, though he see Death inevitable before his Eyes. None participate of the Booty but the General, or Field-Martial, by them call'd <HI>Owe-Aserry,</HI> or <HI>Siasseere:</HI> and yet every one thanks the King, that he will account them worthy of Employment, and deign to send them to the Wars for him. What Arrows remain after the Battel unshot, they lay up in several Chambers in the King's Armory, and presently make as many new again; which poyson'd by the <HI>Feti∣sero's,</HI> become useful for further Service.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Benyn</HI> can raise (as they say) in one day twenty thousand Men in Arms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Potency of the King.</NOTE> and in time of need, eighty, or a hundred thousand: so becomes dread∣ful to all his Neighbors. The care and charge of his Militia he reposes in a Field-Martial, or Generalissimo, who Commands over all the Forces, and in all things acts according to his own pleasure.</P>
<P>The King ruleth with an unlimited Power,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> and so absolute a Soveraignty, that all his Subjects, how great soever, be no better than Slaves: And that ac∣counted no small Priviledge, that Parents present to him their Children, to receive a peculiar Mark to authorize them to be reckon'd in that number.</P>
<PB N="475" REF="297"/>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>His Jurisdiction extends over many Cities, Towns and Villages, wherein none of his Neighbors can equal him. Besides, he holds as Tributaries the Kingdom of <HI>Istama, Forkado, Jaboe, Isago,</HI> and <HI>Oedobo.</HI></P>
<P>For the more orderly Government of the Kingdom, he makes three chief Counsellors in <HI>Great Benyn,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Portuguese, Figdares;</HI> who manage the Affairs of the whole Countrey under the King, (besides whom none superior to them but the Field-Martial, and the King's Mother:) These have Com∣mand over every Corner and Quarter of the City, and draw great Profit from thence: their Names of Office being <HI>Ongogue, Ossade,</HI> and <HI>Arribo.</HI></P>
<P>These send into every City or Town, a certain number of Noble-men, call'd also <HI>Fiadoors,</HI> who decide all Causes, except such as relate to Life and Limb, and may condemn the guilty Person according to the greatness of his Offence, in a Mulct or Penalty; but those greater Trials are sent to <HI>Benyn,</HI> to be decided where the Courts of Justice sit. But the Judges oftentimes, though unknown to the King, yet not without the connivance of some of the greatest <HI>Fiadoors,</HI> are Brib'd to partiality.</P>
<P>The present King keeps a thousand Wives;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Benyn</HI> keeps many Wives.</NOTE> for by the Death of his Father <HI>Kambadie,</HI> such Women as had been taken up for his use, but never known by him, became his Sons by Inheritance: the rest, with whom the Father had fa∣miliarly conversed, may never Marry again, but are shut up together in a Cloyster, and kept by <HI>Eunuchs.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince makes great Wars against his Neighbors towards the East and North, winning from them many Cities and Towns,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He makes great Wars.</NOTE> and thereby enriching his Treasury, with great Booty of Jasper-Stones, and other things.</P>
<P>He keeps such a reserv'd State,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comes but once a year out of his Court.</NOTE> that he appears but once a year at the chief Festival out of his Court, before the Commons, and then on Horseback, adorn'd with all sorts of Royal Ornaments, and attended with three or four hundred Noble-men, both on Horseback and on Foot, and many Musitians before and after, in that manner as is mention'd in the foregoing Description
<PB N="476" REF="298"/>of the City of <HI>Benyn.</HI> But he rides not far, onely fetching a little compass, soon returns. As an Ornament to this short Cavalcade, he exposes to sight some tame Leopards Chain'd, which he keeps for his Recreation, many Dwarfs and Fools, to shew mimick Tricks, and antick Postures, and make Pastime for the People.</P>
<P>At this Festival, ten, twelve, thirteen, or more Slaves, for the honour of the King, are put to death; which they believe, after they have been a while dead, are going to another Countrey, and there reviving, enjoy the greatest felicity imaginable.</P>
<P>Upon another Day the King sheweth his Riches, consisting in Jasper-Stone, Coral, and other Commodities, before all Men, hanging out to publick view; and then he bestows many Presents of Slaves, Women, and other things, on the well-deserving: And also confers on his Favorites many Offices, which concern the Government of Cities and Towns.</P>
<P>The King's Mother,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Mother is in great Honour.</NOTE> for her greater honour, hath a particular Palace with∣out the City, rich and stately built; where she keeps Court, with many Wo∣men and Maids Attendants; and so highly esteem'd, that her Counsel is us'd in all Causes of the Land: yet nevertheless, by a particular Custom, which they term Law, the King and his Mother may not see one another as long as they live.</P>
<P>When a King dies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funeral of the King.</NOTE> a great Cave is digg'd in his Court, broad below, and narrow above, and so deep, that the Diggers must be drown'd in the Water.</P>
<P>In this Cave they put the Corps, and then all his Favorites and Servants ap∣pear to accompany and serve him in the other Life; and when they are gone down to the Corps in the Cave, they set a great Stone over the Mouth, the People that day and night standing round about it.</P>
<P>The next day some go to the Cave, and removing the Stone, ask them within, <HI>What they do?</HI> and, <HI>If none be gone to serve the King?</HI> To which then per∣haps nothing else is answer'd but <HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>The third day they ask the same Question, and then sometimes receive an∣swer, <HI>That such are the first, and those and those are the second,</HI> whom they highly praise, and esteem happy.</P>
<P>At length, after four or five, or more days, the Men dead, and none left to give answer, they give account thereof to the new establish'd King; who pre∣sently makes a great Fire over the Cave, whereat spending a great quantity of Flesh to give away to the Common-People, so solemnizeth his Inaugu∣ration.</P>
<P>After the Cave stopp'd, many Men, as they pass along the Streets, and some in their own Houses, are struck down dead; whose Heads cover'd with a Cloth none dare remove, but so let it lie to be devour'd by Carnifferous Fowl; which are of these two sorts, one call'd <HI>Goere,</HI> and the other <HI>Akalles.</HI></P>
<P>Some hold opinion, that into the foremention'd Cave, no living, but onely the Trunks of beheaded Men are put; as also that they throw in great part of his Royal Vesture, Houshold-stuff, and other Wealth.</P>
<P>By the King's Order yearly Festivals are kept,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Festival time of the deceased King.</NOTE> in Commemoration of the deceased Kings; wherein they make horrible Sacrifices of Men and Beasts, to the number of four or five hundred; but never more than three and twenty in a day: most of them Malefactors, who have deserv'd Death, and reserv'd in the Trunk of a Tree for this Time. But if it happen that there be not Malefa∣ctors enough, then the King, to compleat the number, sends for some of his
<PB N="477" REF="298"/>Servants in the Evening into the Streets, to take all those that go without Lights, and bring them into the Prison. If the surprised be a poor, or idle person, he must expect no favor, but hurri'd to Prison, soon receives his doom; but a rich Man may redeem himself. The greatest <HI>Fiadoors</HI> cannot excuse their Slaves from this duty but by another. And in this manner, the <HI>Fetisero's</HI> in∣tending to make a humane Sacrifice to the Devil, gets a Man by order from the Court, which they may dispose of as they please.</P>
<P>The Crown descends to the Sons, and for want of Sons, to the Brothers.</P>
<P>When the King lieth upon his Death-bed, he sends for one of his Nobility,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inheritance.</NOTE> whom they call <HI>Onegwa;</HI> to whom he declares the right of Succession, and who shall be his Heir; which this Noble-man does reveal to none, till a competent time after the King's Death; but then takes upon him the oversight of the de∣ceased King's Goods and Children, who come with great humility and Salute him, not as yet knowing who shall Inherit the Crown. Every one makes ad∣dress to this <HI>Onegwa</HI> with great respect, in hopes of future advantage, but he continues silent till the appointed time; when sending for the <HI>Owe-Asserry,</HI> that is, the General, tells him which Son the deceased King appointed to Inherit the Crown: whereupon the General, without speaking a word, withdraws to his House; and the <HI>Onegwa</HI> sets up that Son to be King; whereof the retir'd Ge∣neral receiving notice, after five or six days, he comes again to the Court, and calling for the <HI>Onegwa,</HI> demands if that were the old King's will; wherein re∣ceiving an affirmative satisfaction, immediately they present the deposited In∣heritance of the Crown, and he receives the Dominion; whereupon, after thanks return'd, he puts on Royal Robes, and sits down. Then come all the Vassals, from the highest to the lowest, and do homage upon their Knees.</P>
<P>This Solemnity ended, the King retires to another Town, call'd <HI>Goseboe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new King may not at first dwell in <HI>Benyn.</HI></NOTE> to keep his Court; for till a set time-he may not come to <HI>Benyn,</HI> unless to make a wicked Sacrifice of Men and Beasts: But when the <HI>Siasseere</HI> thinks time enough to have been spent, and that the Lessons and Life of his Ancestors be enough inculcated, the same <HI>Siasseere,</HI> or General, invites him to, and entertains him in <HI>Benyn;</HI> where thence-forward he keeps his Court, and Rules according to his own pleasure.</P>
<P>The King once setled upon the Throne,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new King kills all his Brethren.</NOTE> endeavours to cut off all his Bro∣thers, to secure himself against Competitors: of late some of them have been spared; but they made such ill use of that favor, by confederating with the Friends of some condemn'd and banish'd <HI>Fiadoors,</HI> that this present King smo∣ther'd, and other ways put to death all his Brethren, not clandestinely, but upon publick notice: though some stick not to report, that he forc'd them to hang themselves, because none may lay hands on the Royal Bloud to kill them; yet after their Death he order'd them to be hang'd with great Magnificence and State.</P>
<P>Their Religion, if any, consisteth in honouring the Devil, to whom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> as we said before, they sacrifice Men and Beasts: for though they well know and be∣lieve, that there is a God, who hath created Heaven and Earth, and still Rules, yet they esteem it unnecessary to Pray to, or Serve him, because he is not evil, but good; but they seek to appease the Devilwith Sacrifices, for that he al∣ways prosecutes them with evil. They call God, <HI>Orisa;</HI> and the <HI>Whites, Owiorisa,</HI> that is, <HI>God's Child.</HI> They have wooden <HI>Fetisies,</HI> or Idols, which they Worship; and <HI>Fetisero's,</HI> or Priests, who enquire of, and receive answers from the Devil.

<P>The King of <HI>Pongo</HI> hath the report of a powerful Prince; they entitle him, <HI>Manipongo,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord of Pongo;</HI> as the King of <HI>Kongo, Mani-Kongo.</HI> 'Tis true, two other Princes claim a great Jurisdiction near him, <HI>viz.</HI> one at <HI>Majombo,</HI> and another at <HI>Gabon,</HI> yet neither dare resist; he, <HI>Pongian,</HI> and his Palaces nam'd <HI>Goliparta,</HI> exceed in magnificence and extent, all the rest of the Buildings which pretend to Beauty or State.</P>

<P>In Marriage they have no respect to neerness of Relation;

<P>The Houses have no other Walls or Partitions than Reeds,

<P>For Apparel they wear Cloth made of Mats,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habit.</NOTE> and the Shell of the <HI>Matombe</HI>-Tree, over which some hang the Skins of Apes, or Sea-Cats, or any other wild Beast, with a Bell in the middle.</P>
<P>Both Men and Women go for the most part bare Headed, having their Hair

<P>Some for Ornament make holes in their upper lips,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ornament.</NOTE> in which they put pieces of Ivory; and in the under lips, for the like purpose. Many wear Silver Jewels, or Pendants at their Ears and Noses, of three or four Ounces weight; others put thin pieces of Wood thorow them, of five or six Fingers long, or Rings, or Ivory, and pieces of Horn. They colour their Bodies with a Red Paint, made of <HI>Takoel</HI> Wood, and Dye one of their Eyes with it, the other Painting white and yellow, and make two or three Rays like Sun-beams on their Faces. Most of them have rough Girdles of <HI>Briffels</HI> Skin, three, four, five, or six hands broad, yet the ends meet not, but remain about four Fingers breadth asunder, ty'd together with a small String; to which at an Iron Chain hang their Knives.</P>
<P>Some hang round Boxes about their Necks, but they will never let any bo∣dy see what they have in them: Moreover, their Skins be cut and Carv'd in divers manners, but never go abroad, without either a Sword or Ponyard by their sides. Some Women wear Flaps of Bulrushes, and a few great Rings of Iron, Copper, or Tin, on their Arms and Legs.</P>

<P>When the King of <HI>Pongo</HI> fears any War, he removes to another Island, part∣ly defended by its natural strength, and partly, by the great number of Guns, which he hath gotten from the <HI>Netherlanders, French</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships, sur∣pris'd, or otherwise taken.</P>

<P>That of <HI>Lovangomongo</HI> is a large and Hilly Countrey,

The breadth, length, and heighth of them is near alike, that they may stand in equal and uniform distances; and within they have some∣times two or three Rooms or Chambers apart; in one of which they keep their Riches, and that hath Doors at the hinder end, lockt up with a double Lock: some have round about a Fence of Palm-Boughs plash'd; others of Bulrushes wreath'd; some make <HI>Lebonge,</HI> or Wickers, braided together, which inclose six, eight, or more Houses, and they dwell in them as in a Precinct, be∣ing to each other very trusty, and in all accidents helpful.</P>
<P>Their Housholdstuff consists chiefly in Pots, <HI>Calabasses,</HI> Wooden Trays,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Housholdstuff.</NOTE>
<PB N="492" REF="312"/>Mats, a Block whereon they put their Caps, some small and great Baskets, of a neat fashion, into which they put their Cloathes, and other trifling things.</P>
<P>Besides the aforemention'd Division of <HI>Lovango,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Countrey bordering on <HI>Lovango.</HI></NOTE> other Territories lie about it, some of which pay Tribute, and others not; and therefore the Tributary being <HI>Majumba, Dirge,</HI> and divers others, are not unproperly reckon'd as Members of <HI>Lovango,</HI> and put into the King's Title.</P>
<P><HI>Majumba</HI> lieth within three or four Degrees South Latitude,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Niger.</NOTE> bordering in the West upon the Sea; where appears a high black Point, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> na∣med <HI>Cabo Niger,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Black Point,</HI> because it shews afar off, by reason of Trees upon it, black.</P>
<P>Next this <HI>Cape</HI> follows a Road,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Road of <HI>Majumba.</HI></NOTE> by Seamen call'd <HI>The Road of Majumba,</HI> about half a mile in length, that is, from the <HI>Cape Niger</HI> to the South Point, being low and overgrown with Trees. Within the Countrey you discover a red Mountain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mountain <HI>Metute.</HI></NOTE> by the Inhabitants styl'd <HI>Metute.</HI> Not far off a great Salt Lake, a mile broad, opens to the view; out of which some Waters, about half a mile Northward of <HI>Cape Niger</HI> run into the Sea, but the passages are sometimes choaked up by the Waves, that beats extraordinarily against them.</P>
<P>On the Shore stands the Village <HI>Majumba,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Village <HI>Majumba.</HI></NOTE> built in one long row, so near the Sea, that the incroaching Waves oftentimes necessitates the Inhabitants to re∣move behind the Village: on the North a River very full of Oysters poures its Water into the Sea, and hath in its Mouth, at the most, not above six, some∣times but three or four Foot of Water; yet farther within boasts a considerable bigness, breadth, depth, and length, extending at least fifteen miles upward Southward of <HI>Lovango,</HI> to the great help and conveniency of those that fetch Red-Wood, which otherwise they must carry much farther; whereas now they bring it in <HI>Canoos</HI> down the River.</P>
<P><HI>Majumba</HI> is barren of Grain, but yields plenty of <HI>Banano's,</HI> which they call <HI>Bittebbe</HI> and <HI>Makondo;</HI> of which they make Bread: abundance also of Palm-Trees, from whence they extract Wine; and the Rivers afford plenty of Fish.</P>
<P>The People having no peculiar Prince, are very rude and savage, giving themselves to work all manner of mischief.</P>
<P>Here was formerly a great Trade for Elephants-Teeth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade</NOTE> but now almost decay'd and lost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manibomme,</HI> that is, the Deputy of <HI>Lovangiri,</HI> pays for all the Red-Wood brought from <HI>Sette</HI> down the River to <HI>Majumba,</HI> Ten in the Hundred.</P>
<P>The Women fish for Oysters out of the aforemention'd River, fetching them up in great Trays from the bottom, then opening and smoaking them, they will remain good for some Moneths: These smoaked Oysters, as all other sorts of Flesh or Fish so smoaked, in the Countrey Language are call'd <HI>Barbette.</HI></P>
<P>Over this Territory one of the Counsellors of State to the King of <HI>Lo∣vango,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> named, as we said, <HI>Manibomme,</HI> Commands, rendring no account to his Master, but onely the Red-Wood.</P>
<P>Eight or nine miles Southward, lieth a Point call'd <HI>Quilongo,</HI> or <HI>Sellage,</HI> ac∣cording to the Name of the neighboring Village.</P>
<P>This Tract of Land appears to ships at Sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prospect of <HI>Majumba</HI> at Sea.</NOTE> coming out of the South, with two Mountains, in the shape of a Womans two Breasts, and therefore call'd <HI>Quanny.</HI></P>
<P>About two miles Southward of the <HI>Breasts,</HI> glides the River <HI>Quila,</HI> abound∣ing with Fish, and precipitating it self with a strong Water-fall into the Sea.</P>
<PB N="493" REF="312"/>
<P>¶ THe Dominion of <HI>Chilongatia Mokonga,</HI> is a large compass of Ground, ly∣ing Northward of the River <HI>Quila,</HI> in former times a free Kingdom, but now by Conquest a Member of <HI>Lovango;</HI> yet still enjoy their antient Cu∣stoms and Priviledges, paying Tribute onely.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manibeloor,</HI> or Governour of <HI>Chilongo,</HI> hath absolute Superiority during his life; and after his Decease the People may chuse another, without asking the King of <HI>Lovango</HI> leave.</P>
<P>¶ THe Jurisdiction of <HI>Sette,</HI> about sixteen miles from the River <HI>Majumba,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Territory of <HI>Sette.</HI></NOTE> borders in the West, at the Sea; and water'd by a River also nam'd <HI>Sette.</HI></P>
<P>Here grows both great and small <HI>Mille,</HI> the first call'd, <HI>Massa-Manponta;</HI> and the other, <HI>Massa-Minkale.</HI></P>
<P>Many Potato's, in the Countrey Phrase stil'd <HI>Iqua Anpotte;</HI> and Palm-Wine,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> with them <HI>Malaffa,</HI> as the Trees, <HI>Mabba;</HI> or the Nut, <HI>Imba;</HI> and the Pith or Kernel, <HI>Inbonga.</HI></P>
<P>This Province yields extraordinary plenty of Red-Wood, besides other sorts of Timber. Of this they have two sorts, the one by those of <HI>Sette,</HI> call'd <HI>Quines,</HI> which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> us'd to buy, but is not esteem'd in <HI>Lovango;</HI> the other, <HI>By-Sesse,</HI> being much heavier, and redder, bears both a good Price and reputation. The Root of this <HI>By-Sesse,</HI> call'd <HI>Angansy Abysesse,</HI> exceeds in hardness and deepness of colour, which makes it much valued. With this Wood the <HI>Blacks</HI> drive a great Trade all over the Coast of <HI>Angola,</HI> and in <HI>Lo∣vango,</HI> dealing indeed very seldom with any other than their own People; be∣ing at first brought from <HI>Sette,</HI> where the Governor receives the Custom of Ten in the Hundred, which we mention'd before.</P>
<P>Some Hens and Goats breed here, though not in great numbers; but the Woods afford all sorts of wild Beasts.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants feed upon <HI>Mille, Banano's,</HI> and wild Creatures.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Sette</HI> and the <HI>Cape Lope-Gonzalvez,</HI> lieth <HI>Gobby,</HI> a Territory having Morasses, Lakes, and Rivers, all Navigated by <HI>Canoos.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefest Town lieth about a days Journey from the Sea-shore.</P>
<P>The Rivers feed many Water-Elephants, and divers Fishes; but the Land breeds few Cattel, besides Beasts of Prey.</P>
<P>Though the People claim a kind of propriety in Wives, yet is it such as merits not to be brought under the name of Marriage, not for that they take as many as they can, but because when any Friend comes to visit the Husband, he immediately, as a mark of amity, prostitutes one of his Wives to him. And in all other Cases gives such liberty, that Women taken in Adultery, receive commendations and rewards, rather than obloquy and punishment.</P>
<P>A Man, when first Married, gets not esteem nor regard among the Wo∣mans Friends, till he hath smartly beaten and boxed his Wife; and thence∣forward they reckon him one of that Family: And this usage hath by custom become so naturaliz'd, that a Woman suspects her Husbands Love, unless he frequently beat her.</P>
<P>Their Language hath affinity with that of <HI>Lovango,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> differing onely in some few words, so that they easily understand each other.</P>
<P>They make great Wars upon their Neighbors, especially those of <HI>Comma,</HI> between <HI>Cape de Lope-Gonzalvez</HI> and <HI>Gobby.</HI></P>
<PB N="494" REF="313"/>
<P>The Commodities brought out of <HI>Europe</HI> thither, are Musquets, Powder, bright Copper Kettles, white and brown Linnen, and ordinary Cloth.</P>
<P>Their Arms consist in Arrows,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> Bowes, and <HI>Assagays;</HI> the first they call <HI>In∣setto,</HI> the second <HI>Matta,</HI> or <HI>Boeta,</HI> and the third <HI>Janga</HI> and <HI>Zonga.</HI></P>
<P>The Government of the Countrey remains at this time in the hands of a Woman.</P>
<P>In all other Customs, Religions, and Conjurations, they agree with those of <HI>Lovango,</HI> onely they are more deceitful and treacherous.</P>
<P>¶ <HI>DIngy</HI> borders at <HI>Lovango,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Territory of <HI>Dingy.</HI></NOTE> Cadongo,</HI> and <HI>Vango,</HI> a great Countrey, and full of Towns and Villages. A Tributary to the <HI>Lovangian</HI> King; yet hath its own Lords, which Rule by succession. As to the Plants, Beasts, Customs of the Inhabitants, Governments, and Religions, take here this brief account.</P>
<P>This Countrey of <HI>Lovango</HI> affords divers sorts of Fruit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Massa-Mamponta,</HI> or great <HI>Mille; Massa-Minkale,</HI> or little <HI>Mille;</HI> and red <HI>Mille,</HI> which they use in stead of Tares.</P>
<P>There grow also Potato's, call'd <HI>Limbale Ampaita, Bakovens, Injames,</HI> with them <HI>Imbale, Emtogifto,</HI> or Ginger, and other strange Fruits, as <HI>Goebes, Mando∣nyns,</HI> or <HI>Dongo</HI> and <HI>Fonsi;</HI> and some Herbs, the chief of which they account <HI>Insansy,</HI> bitter of taste; <HI>Imboa,</HI> and <HI>Insua;</HI> Purceline and wild Fetherfew.</P>
<P>They have also <HI>Malanga,</HI> or Pumpkins; <HI>Mampet,</HI> or Sugar-Canes; <HI>Mihenga,</HI> a juicy Fruit; but they Plant no more of it than they can eat from hand to hand; and <HI>Maye-Monola,</HI> or Tobacco.</P>
<P><HI>Grain of Paradice,</HI> by them stil'd <HI>Indonga-Anpota,</HI> grows here, but in no quan∣tities, because neither Sown nor Planted.</P>
<P>Also great abundance of <HI>Banano's</HI> and <HI>Mandioque,</HI> or <HI>Farinha;</HI> of which they make Bread.</P>
<P>Of the Leaves of <HI>Majaera</HI> they make a pretty relishing and savory Food, dressing it with smoaked Fish, Palm-Oyl, Salt, and <HI>Achy,</HI> or <HI>Brasile</HI> Pepper: but their common Food is <HI>Fondy,</HI> or <HI>Sonsy,</HI> made of the Flour of <HI>Mille.</HI></P>
<P>There are also many <HI>Calabasses,</HI> which grown ripe, they dry and make Dishes of for several uses.</P>
<P>A sort of little Apples grows on low Trees, which prove a very refreshing Fruit, and good to put into Drink as Spice, or as the <HI>Kola.</HI> There is a larger sort thereof call'd <HI>Cucomba,</HI> crude, sowre, and corroding, but boyl'd, tastes very well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kola</HI> grows on great Trees in Husks, ten and twelve together, and yields Fruit once a year. This, as experience teacheth, eaten in the Evening hinders sleep.</P>
<P>The Root <HI>Melando,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melando.</NOTE> whose Leaf climbeth up on a Tree or Pole (like our Hops) eaten gives an <HI>Aromatick</HI> taste.</P>
<P><HI>Cassia Fistula,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cassia Fistula.</NOTE> or Pipe Cassia, they use in their Witchcrafts and Enchant∣ments.</P>
<P>Of Oranges,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oranges, Lemons, and Coco-Nuts.</NOTE> Lemons, and Coco-Nuts, they have but few; for setting no va∣lue on them, they will not bestow the pains to transplant and propagate them.</P>
<P><HI>Achy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Achy.</NOTE> or <HI>Brasilian</HI> Pepper, groweth wild, and much used; so also Cotton.</P>
<P>Their Fields produce three sorts of Grain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grain, or Pulse.</NOTE> or Pulse; the first great Wheat, or <HI>Gabba,</HI> growing under the Earth; the second sort about the bigness of a Rouncifal, or Horse-Bean, grows on Trees about eight or nine Foot high, in Cods, and eaten with <HI>Enganga;</HI> the third sort shaped like a little Bean, grows

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> along the earth in rows of white Cods, almost the same length with those of the <HI>Turky</HI> Beans. Besides these they have two other sorts, accounted so choice a Dainty, that they are esteem'd a Food onely for the Rich; the one sort re∣sembles our Garden-Beans; the other <HI>Turky</HI>-Beans, both white, but have some difference in the shape.</P>
<P>All these Fruits continue the whole year through, except between <HI>Majumba,</HI> and <HI>Cabo de Gonzalvez;</HI> whose Inhabitants use <HI>Bananos</HI> in stead of Bread; and Fish for other Provision.</P>
<P><HI>Matombe</HI> Trees grow numerously,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matombe.</NOTE> but yet exceeded by the vast multitude of Palm Trees.</P>
<P>These <HI>Matombes</HI> afford, first good Wine, which they drink in stead of that of Palm, but not so strong: The Branches make Rafters and Laths for the Hou∣ses, and Couches to Sleep on: The Leaves are used for Tiles, and Fence off the greatest Rains.</P>
<P>All the Garments worn in <HI>Lovango,</HI> are made of these Leaves, which they use also in stead of Money, having no sort of Mettal Coyn'd: but because the <HI>Matombe</HI> Leaves are not so strong as those of the Palm; the Clothes made thereof are in less esteem, seldom making of it any other than course <HI>Jago</HI>-Clothes.</P>
<P>Their manur'd ground is so furtile, that it affords three Crops,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Seed ground.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> small <HI>Mille,</HI> little Beans, and Wigge that is sown with <HI>Mille,</HI> as Rape with us.</P>
<P>Some have their Lands, one, two, or three miles; others, a day or two's Journey from their Dwellings, whether they go at Seed-time, and remain with their Families, till they have Sow'd their Ground, then return to their Habitations again.</P>
<P>They Plough not the Land, but break it up with an Instrument like a Hoe,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How their Land is Plow'd.</NOTE> or rather a Masons Trowel, but broader and hollower.</P>
<P>Hoggs, <HI>Cabrietes,</HI> or Sheep, Goats, Cows, and all sorts of Fowls,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The living Creatures.</NOTE> breed more plentifully here, than in any other places, on the Coast of <HI>Congo,</HI> or <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<PB N="496" REF="314"/>
<P>The Inhabitants are strong Limb'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kind of Inhabitants.</NOTE> large of Stature, and decent in Be∣havior; commonly jealous of their Wives, yet themselves Wanton and Un∣chast; covetous and greedy to attain Riches, yet generous and free hearted one to another; very much addicted to Drinking Wine of Palm, yet slighting our <HI>European</HI> Wine; no Zealots in matters of Religion, yet extreamly Su∣perstitious, so that it is pity they want the knowledge of Real and Divine Truths.</P>
<P>The Men wear long Garments,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cloathing.</NOTE> reaching from then middle down to their Feet, and below border'd with Fringe, but leave the upper part of their Body naked: The Stuffs whereof they are made, may be divided into four sorts, one of which none may wear but the King, and those he permits out of singu∣lar Favor, or as marks of Dignity. They are call'd sometimes <HI>Libongo;</HI> other∣whiles <HI>Bondo,</HI> which no Weavers are permitted to Sell, upon pain of Death. There are two other sorts usually sold, the best call'd <HI>Kimbes,</HI> being a Habit for the greatest Nobleman; made very fine, and with curious Workmanship Flowr'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fit for Handkerchiefs.</NOTE> and beautifi'd with exquisite Imagery, each Cloth holding about two Spans and a half in Square, which a Weaver with his greatest diligence may well spend fifteen or sixteen days in Working to finish it. The second sort call'd <HI>Sokka,</HI> are less by one half than the <HI>Kimbes;</HI> yet many that have little handl'd their Work, would easily mistake the one for the other; for both are high, and Cutwork, with Images, or Figures upon them, but the turn'd side gives the distinction, by the Courseness or Fineness. Six of the foremen∣tion'd Pieces make a Garment, which they know how to Colour, Red, Black, or Green.</P>
<P>The two other sorts of Cloathes are a wearing for Common People, being plain, without Images or Figures, yet have their distinctions; one being closer and firmer wrought than the other. These are many times Slash'd or Pink'd, from the middle to the knees, as old fashion'd <HI>Spanish</HI> Breeches were wont, with small and great cuts.</P>
<P>Every man, by promise or injunction, is bound to wear a Furr-skin over his Cloathes, right before his Privacies; <HI>viz.</HI> of a tame Cat, Otter, Cattamoun∣tain, great Wood or wild Cat, or of an <HI>Agali,</HI> or Civet Cat; with whose Civet they sometimes also anoint themselves. Besides these, they have very fair speckl'd Skins, call'd <HI>Enkiny,</HI> of high Price among them, which none may wear, but the King and his peculiar Favorites.</P>
<P>Some Persons of high Degree when they Travel, wear six or eight Skins for Garments; others, as the King and his greatest Nobility, cause five or six Skins to be sew'd together, interlac'd with many white and black speckl'd Tails of the foremention'd <HI>Enkiny.</HI></P>
<P>Cross-wise in the midst of the Skin, they set commonly round, Tufts made of the aforesaid Furr, and white and black Parrets Feathers; and at the edges Elephants Hair, spread round in winding-Trails. Every one also wears a String about his middle, made of the peeling of <HI>Matombe</HI> Leaves, of which there are two sorts; one call'd <HI>Poes-anana,</HI> and the other <HI>Poes-anpoma;</HI> with which they tye their Cloathes fast.</P>
<P>Besides they have two Girdles one above another, that is, one of fine Red or Black Cloath, slightly Embroyder'd in three or four places; the other of Yarn, wrought in Flowers, and fastned together before with double Strings, call'd <HI>Pondes.</HI> These Girdles are commonly three or four Inches broad; wherefore the Cloathes sent thither out of <HI>Europe</HI> with broad Lists, serve to be Embroi∣der'd and Quill'd to make such Girdles.</P>
<PB N="497" REF="314"/>
<P>Some wear Girdles of Bulrushes, and young Palm Branches; others of peel∣ings of a Tree call'd <HI>Catta;</HI> and in other places <HI>Emsande,</HI> which they Weave and Pleit together; of the same peelings Match for Guns is made, which stand the <HI>Portugals</HI> in good stead.</P>
<P>Between the upper and lower Girdle they set several sorts of Ornaments, and about their Necks white and black Beads; the latter they call <HI>Insimba Frot∣ta,</HI> and the white <HI>Insimba Gemba;</HI> but the last bears the greatest value.</P>
<P>Others wear Triangular Breast-Chains, brought thither out of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ornament.</NOTE> and by them nam'd <HI>Panpanpane;</HI> some Ivory cut in pieces, and some sort of flat <HI>Scalops,</HI> which they polish very smooth and round, and wear them strung as Neck-Laces.</P>
<P>On their naked legs they put Brass, Copper, or Iron Rings, about the big∣ness of the smallest end of a Tobacco Pipe; or else trim them with black and white Beads.</P>
<P>On their Arms they wear many Rings of several fashions, and light; which they temper in the Forging with Oyl of Palm.</P>
<P>Over their Shoulders they hang a Sack, about three quarters of a yard long, sew'd together, onely a little opening left to put in the hand.</P>
<P>Upon their Head they have an artificial Cap, made to sit close.</P>
<P>And in their Hands, either a great Knife, Bowe and Arrows, or a Sword; for they never go without Arms.</P>
<P>The Womens Clothes, which come a little below their knees, are made of the same with the Mens; over which they sometimes put some fine <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Stuff or Linen, but without any Girdles: The uppermost part of the bo∣dy, and the Head remains always naked and bare, but on their Arms, Legs, and Necks, many Rings, Beads and other Toys.</P>
<P>Their usual Diet is fresh and smoak'd Fish, especially <HI>Sardyn,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> which they take with a Hook, and Boyl with Herbs and <HI>Achy,</HI> or <HI>Brasilian Pepper.</HI> People of Quality eat with their Fish <HI>Massanga,</HI> or small <HI>Mille,</HI> first stamp'd with a Pestle, then Boyled with Water, and so Kneaded together.</P>
<P>They Swear by the King, speaking these words, <HI>Fyga Manilovanga;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Oath, or Swearing.</NOTE> but the highest Oath is, the Drinking of <HI>Bondes Root;</HI> and never used, but when some∣thing is presently to be undertaken or perform'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bondes</HI> is onely a Root of a Tree, of a russet Colour, very Bitter,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bondes</HI> Root, or Adjura∣tion Root.</NOTE> and astringent; and gets (as they say) by enchantment of the <HI>Ganga,</HI> or Conjurer, perfect power and vertue. This Root they scrape with a Knife, and put into a Pot of Water, of which the accused Party takes about a Pint and half, admi∣nistred by a person appointed by the King for that purpose.</P>
<P>By this <HI>Bonde</HI>-Drink also, they find out the cause of any Casualty or Mis∣hap, and how it chances; for they believe that none can die, but he must be brought to his end, either by himself, or another: So when any falls into the Water, and is drown'd, they will not consider the accident, but stifly maintain he was bewitch'd; and that some enemy hath by his <HI>Moquisies,</HI> or Sorceries brought it upon him. If any in a Wood, or by the Way, be kill'd by a Tyger or Wolf, they firmly believe and say, that the Tyger was a <HI>Dakkin,</HI> that is, a Sorcerer or Witch, who had by the <HI>Moquisies</HI> or Idols, chang'd themselves into such a beast; and he that should go about to perswade them to think other∣wise, they would laugh him to scorn, and hold him for a fool; so if any mans house or goods happen to be burn'd, they say, that one or other of the <HI>Moqui∣sies</HI> hath set it on fire; or if at any time they have a more than usual drowth,
<PB N="498" REF="315"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> they say, one <HI>Moquisie</HI> or other, hath not his desire, and therefore keeps back the Rain; and therefore to enquire and find out such things, who should be the cause thereof; <HI>Bonde</HI>-drink is put in practise.</P>
<P>In like manner, if any weighty or criminal matter, either of Sorcery or Theft be laid to any ones charge, and it cannot be ascertain'd by the Oracle of <HI>Ganga</HI> or their Conjurer; they forthwith condemn the suspected person to drink of the <HI>Bonde</HI>-drink, which is perform'd in this manner;</P>
<P>The Complainant must go to the King,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Bonde</HI>-drink is drank.</NOTE> and beseech him to appoint an ad∣ministrator of the <HI>Bondes;</HI> for which he pays the King his due. These <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers are about eight or ten persons, appointed by the King and his Nobility; who meeting under the open Heaven, in a broad way, sit down upon the ground, and about three a Clock in the afternoon, begin their work, for by that, the Complainers must be there; who coming with their whole Retinue and Generation, the <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers, admonish to bring to light the righteous∣ness of the Matter, without any siding or partiality; which he adjures them to with an Oath by their <HI>Fetisies,</HI> which they have standing round about them. Then also appears the Accus'd, with his Family; for seldom one person alone, but commonly, the whole Neighbourhood is accus'd; these meet, and standing in a row, come by course one by one to the <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers, (who have a little Drum, upon which they continually Beat,) and receiving about a Pint and a half of Liquor, they retire to their places again.</P>
<P>After this, one of the <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers riseth up, with certain sticks of a <HI>Bacoven</HI> tree in his hands, which he flings after the Accus'd, requiring him to fall down; and if he have no guilt, to stand up and make Water, in token of his Innocency. Then the <HI>Bonde</HI>-giver cuts the Root before them all, that every one may walk up and down over it. In the doing whereof, if one or other of them chance to fall, then the standers by set up a loud Cry, and the party fall'n, lieth like a possess'd man, speechless, but with horrible Convulsions in all his Limbs, not enduring his body to be touch'd; and this they hold for a
<PB N="499" REF="315"/>certain sign, that such a Person is guilty of what he was charged withall. But those which Urine, receive acclamations of joy and praise, and both Strangers and his Friends conduct him to his Dwelling, declaring his innocency to every one they meet. On the other hand, if it be a matter criminal, that the question'd Person stands thus convict, or that he hath many ill-willers, they presently carry him about a quarter of an hours Journey from the place of Trial to a broad Way, and there cut him in pieces: but if it be but some Peccadillio, or they have a mind to spare the accused, then with Man's Or∣dure, mingled with Water and some green Herbs pour'd into his Mouth (which is the onely Antidote) they seek to expell the Poyson.</P>
<P>Some when they are accused have permission for their Slaves to drink in their stead; but if he falls asleep, the Master himself must take it, and in his sleep the Antidote is given. If the Master fall, and it be a great Crime, he must die; but a small matter, he buys off the offence with some Slaves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bonde</HI>-givers oftentimes use great jugling and imposture; for though a Person have no guilt, yet he will by his Sorcery make him fall, if either the People hate him, or the Accusers be great.</P>
<P>Many also, whose guilt their evil living sufficiently demonstrates, so corrupt by Bribes and Gifts, that they seem innocent; but by this means it goes very hard with the Poor, who generally suffer, while it may be the guilty sit by laughing at their inferiors; so true is that of the old Poet,
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Nil habet infoelix Paupertas durius in se</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quam quod ridiculos homines facit</HI>—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No pressures those in Poverty more gall</L>
<L>Than scorn, and be contemptible to all.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Lastly, the Accusers bring the Convict naked (for the Master of the <HI>Bondes</HI> takes his Cap and his Cloathes as his Vails) before the King's Court, where he receives sentence of death, to be hew'd in pieces, as we related before.</P>
<P>They use no peculiar Ceremonies in Marriage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> nor scarce trouble themselves for consent of Friends: some chuse Children of six, seven, or eight years of Age, who when they arrive to ten, they take home and bring up in private: If afterwards any behave themselves impudently, the Husband may without any Man's gainsaying punish her.</P>
<P>But some Parents will not let their Daughters Marry, till arrived to per∣fect Womanhood; and then whoever desires to Match with her, he goes to her Friends, and buys her of them at a certain Price.</P>
<P>If it happen (as it doth very often) that a Maid be enticed to leudeness be∣fore Marriage, they must both appear in the presence of some hundreds of Men before the King at his Court, and declaring their fault, the King gives pardon.</P>
<P>And this they judge so necessary, that many assuredly believe, if they had not obtain'd absolution from the King in manner beforemention'd, that the whole Countrey would perish with drowth, and it would not Rain; where∣as yet the like business is perform'd by others that have no such belief, with∣out acquainting the King.</P>
<P>The Child follows the Mother, and is a Slave if she be so, though the Father be a Free-man; but if the Mother be free, and the Father a Slave, yet the Child is free.</P>
<P>Every Noble-man may have as many Wives as he hath ability to Cloathe, and can procure Fish and Wine for their moderate Maintenance; so that
<PB N="500" REF="316"/>some have ten or twelve; but every ordinary person hath commonly two or three.</P>
<P>The Women do all the servile works, for they break the Ground, Sowe and Reap, pluck up the <HI>Mille,</HI> beat it into Meal, boyl it, and give it to their Hus∣bands to eat, who take care for nothing but Drink. When the Husband eats, the Wife sits afar off, and takes the leavings; and withall so slavishly subject to their Husbands, that they dare not speak to them but upon their bare Knees, and in meeting them, as a demonstration of their submission, must creep upon their Hands.</P>
<P>They colour their whole Bodies with <HI>Takoel</HI>-Wood ground upon Stones, and so made a fit Painting.</P>
<P>If it happen, that one enjoys another Man's Wife, they fall into great con∣tention about it, untill satisfaction be given to the injur'd Party, and agree∣ment made, to which of them she shall belong: Nor doth this Quarrel bound it self within the Families of these, but all the Neighbors of the Place, where the injur'd Person dwells, think themselves oblig'd to help him; as on the other hand, the Offender's Neighbors help him, yet still with this caution, that they spare no endeavor to make peace: However this raises jealousies among them, which sometimes rise to that heighth, as to end in blood.</P>
<P>When any die,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nerals for the Dead.</NOTE> they make great shew of sorrow, lamenting and howling in the Way, like People distracted; then the Friends bring out the Corps in∣to the Street, to wash and make clean, continuing their barbarous lamenta∣tions, and interrogating, <HI>Why he dy'd?</HI> and, <HI>Whether he wanted Meat and Drink?</HI> with other like idle Fancies; in which madness they keep up two or three hours. In the mean time his nearest Relations bring several of their Goods to cast by the Corps in the Grave, as also all his own, and then snatching it up, run away therewith, as if they had stoll'n it. Part of the Goods they bury with him, and part they set upon the Grave upon Poles; but first they cut them to prevent stealing. In the Evening the Friends assemble again, and bemone the Dead: And this they continue six Weeks every Morning and Evening.</P>
<P>When any of Quality dies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funerals for the Great Men.</NOTE> the Friends gather together; with whom joyn those of other Neighborhoods, and such as dwell in Towns and Places re∣mote, that scarce knew him, and then go about crying and mourning, the Tears running down their Cheeks and Breasts, with both their Hands upon their Heads, and so come to the Habitation of the Deceased; where setting themselves about the Body, they begin again to howl in a fearful manner.</P>
<P>The Dead lieth in the midst, or sits sometimes upon a Mat, or Block, sup∣ported and propp'd up with Wood to keep him from falling. They pare his Nails, shave off his Hair, anoint his Body with <HI>Takoel</HI>-Wood; and in the mean while the Women run about and relate his Life and Speeches by rule and or∣der, setting forth also the greatness of his Linage and Family, with what State and Grandeur he maintain'd himself and Retinue, whom he accounted his Friends, and whom his Enemies. This Relation of his Enemies immedi∣ately raising jealousies in the heads of his surviving Friends, they begin to en∣quire into the cause of his Death; whereof not able to obtain any certainty, they resolve to go to the <HI>Moquisies</HI> for advice. While this continues in debate, every one brings and gives to the next Friends, or those whom his Death most concerns, some Cloathes or Garments, wherewith to defray the Expences, which they shall be at in searching out the cause of the Deceased's Death. This having continued two, three, or more days and nights, with some re∣mission
<PB N="501" REF="316"/>of Laments; at last they run away with the Corps, and bury it either in the Fields, or by <HI>Chienga,</HI> where divers Wizards call'd <HI>Kokokoo,</HI> dwell, throw∣ing part of his Goods into the Grave, and part over it, as we have it, and par∣ticularly one of his <HI>Moquisies,</HI> that is, a Pot, a Wooden Shovel, an Arrow, <HI>Kalbas,</HI> a Cup to drink in, Tobacco, a Pipe, a Staff, Lances, or such like. After this the nearest Friends continue their Morning and Evening Laments, sometimes for two or three Moneths, or longer.</P>
<P>Now if the nearest to the Deceased will shew his duty, in searching after the cause of his Death, he falls upon the inquiry; for which they use several ways, but the following is the most common.</P>
<P>They go to the <HI>Conga,</HI> or Wizard, sitting upon the Ground behind a House,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the cause of any Man's death is searched after.</NOTE> and lay a great Knife down before him, which he oftentimes touches, and then rubs his hands one upon another; whereupon they speak to him in these words: <HI>Such a one is deceased, or dead, we have buried him, is he brought to his end by Witchcraft? or have his</HI> Moquisies <HI>kill'd him?</HI> If upon this enquiring the Hands be∣gin to strike hard one upon another without any more rubbing, they take it for granted his <HI>Moquisies</HI> kill'd him. Again, if the hands in rubbing happen to strike one another, and he brings them right again with clapping, then they be∣gin once more, and ask again, <HI>Such a one is dead, and brought to his end by</HI> Moquisies, <HI>or Witchcraft, where dwells he? who hath done it? here or yonder, or is he of his acquain∣tance?</HI> &amp;c. till they know more; or if they suppose more had a hand in it than one, they ask, <HI>Whether Man or Woman did it, by what</HI> Moquisies <HI>he was bewitched, and what cause they had for it,</HI> and the like. Sometimes they run two or three Moneths from one Town to another, and from one <HI>Ganga</HI> to another, and leave no <HI>Moquisies</HI> almost unasked, till at length they suppose how it was done, or in what Town he dwells, or under whom he lives: If they dare not name or discover the Person, they take the whole Town, that they may find out the Guilty therein; and applying themselves for that end to one of the King's No∣bility, enquire whether there be a <HI>Bony,</HI> that is, a Hamlet where they suppose the suspected Party to be, that he may drink <HI>Bondes,</HI> who gives them leave: Then he goes to the chiefest of the <HI>Bondes,</HI> call'd <HI>Konda,</HI> and seeks for some to make ready the <HI>Bonde</HI>-Drink, and to administer it.</P>
<P>In the Morning when they intend to begin, they come to the <HI>Boany,</HI> or Hamlet, together, setting themselves down in the midst of the Village, in an open place upon the Market, if there be one: and then the <HI>Bondes</HI> takes out of every Hamlet a Man, who drinks for the whole. Now if one of these fall, that Hamlet, for which he drank, must all hand the Cup one to another, be∣cause they believe the guilty Person hides himself therein.</P>
<P>If all the Men escape, then comes the lot to the Women, who drink not themselves, but others in their Names; and if there shall fall one, or more, the Women for whom they drank are taken for guilty, and as Sorceresses are put to death. But of this we have said more than enough.</P>
<P>The Children inherit not after the Father's Decease, but the eldest Brother,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Inheritance.</NOTE> or Sister; and he or she is necessitated to bring up the Children, till they can live of themselves.</P>
<P>There are many Handicrafts among them, as Weavers, Smiths, Cap-makers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Employments.</NOTE> Potters, Bead-makers, Carpenters, Vintners, or Tapsters, Fisher-men, <HI>Canoo</HI>-makers, Merchants, and other Traders. They make a kind of Hemp, taken out from the peel'd Leaves of the <HI>Matombe</HI>-Trees, about three quarters of a Yard square. This Hemp is of two sorts, the one call'd <HI>Poesana,</HI> fit onely for
<PB N="502" REF="317"/>course Cloathes; and the other <HI>Poesampama,</HI> whereof they Weave finer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> buy those Clothes in great abundance, and carry them to <HI>Lovango Saint Paulo,</HI> where they are deliver'd in stead of Money; for in that place they are the standard to value all Commodities by. Every Cloth, call'd by the <HI>Portuguese Panos Sambes;</HI> and in Countrey phrase, <HI>Mollole-Vierry,</HI> consists of four pieces stitch'd together, call'd <HI>Libonges;</HI> seventeen such are valu'd at for one piece of Slezy Ticking; and every pound of Ivory, bears the price of five <HI>Libonges.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner the Inhabitants of <HI>Lovango,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Money.</NOTE> in stead of Money, use sleight wo∣ven Clothes, made of the Leaves of <HI>Matombe</HI>-Trees, every Cloth consisting of four pieces, each of about a Span and half square; of which one is worth a pen∣ny: but of late these Clothes are fallen low, and consequently little used.</P>
<P>Most of the riches of the Inhabitants consists in Slaves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches.</NOTE> for what other wealth they have, is lavish't out profusely in idle expences.</P>
<P>The Merchandizes brought out of this Countrey by the <HI>Whites,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> are Elephants Teeth, Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, and other things; but are gotten with great labour, by the Inhabitants, because of the far lying off of the Mines.</P>
<P>From a certain place call'd <HI>Sondy,</HI> not far from <HI>Abysine,</HI> or the Empire of <HI>Prester John,</HI> most of the Copper is brought thither.</P>
<P>Towards <HI>September</HI> there flock to <HI>Sondy,</HI> many Smiths from several Coun∣treys to melt Copper; who continue there till <HI>May,</HI> and then depart, because of the approaching dry time. But by the unskilfulness of the Inhabitants, this Copper is much debas'd, who melt all Mettals one among another; to pre∣vent which, some have been sent where the Mines are, to teach them to distin∣guish and separate the Mettals; but they would never permit them to do any thing, or be drawn to alter their own vicious method.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whites</HI> bring also out of this Countrey Elephants-Tails, which the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> buy and carry to <HI>Lovango Saint Paulo,</HI> where they prove very good and ready Merchandize; that is, an hundred Hairs put together, they value at a thousand <HI>Rees.</HI> This Hair the <HI>Blacks</HI> braid very finely, and wear about their Necks; but the greatest and longest Hairs braided, they wear about the Waste; of which, fifty Hairs are sold for a thousand <HI>Rees.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lovango,</HI> useth to vent yearly great abundance of Ivory; but every year the quantity decreases, because the <HI>Blacks</HI> fetch it so far out of the Countrey, and carry it upon their Heads. The chiefest place where the Staple for this Com∣modity remains, is call'd <HI>Backkamele,</HI> about three hundred miles up into the Countrey, so that the <HI>Blacks</HI> have near three moneths labour, before they can finish their journey forwards and backwards.</P>
<P>The Merchandize brought by those of <HI>Lovango,</HI> are Salt, Oyl of Palm, broad Knives, made by themselves, course Slesie Tickings, black Looking-Glasses, Cushion Leaves, and some other Trifles, besides Slaves and Elephants-Teeth: In the former of which, they make use of these Slaves to carry their goods from place to place, to save other extraordinary charge of carriage.</P>
<P>The Roads from <HI>Lovango</HI> to <HI>Pombo, Sondy, Monsel, Great Mokoko,</HI> and other places, are much infested by the <HI>Jages;</HI> so that it is dangerous for Merchants to travel that way; though they usually go in whole Troops under a chief Commander that is very faithful to them.</P>
<P>But for the obtaining of free Trade in <HI>Lovango,</HI> the <HI>Whites</HI> must continually give presents to the King, and his Mother the Queen, and two Noblemen, ap∣pointed Overseers of the Factory, call'd <HI>Manikes,</HI> and <HI>Manikinga,</HI> and several others.</P>
<PB N="503" REF="317"/>
<P>In Trading, the <HI>Blacks</HI> of <HI>Lovango</HI> use their own Language, yet some Fisher∣men on the Shore speak broken <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and there commonly serve as Bro∣kers, between the Buyers and Sellers; as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Lovango</HI> hath several eminent Councellors,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> with whom he ad∣vises in matters of State, Entituled, <HI>Mani-Bomme, Mani-Mambo, Mani-Beloor,</HI> and <HI>Mani-Belullo, Mani-Kinga, Mani-Matta,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The first, or <HI>Mani-Bomme,</HI> which is as much as Lord Admiral, hath under his Jurisdiction <HI>Lovangiri,</HI> and is indeed the most eminent of all the rest.</P>
<P>The second, <HI>Mani-Mamba,</HI> supervises <HI>Lovangomongo;</HI> but not alone, for he hath generally two or three joyn'd with him in Commission.</P>
<P>The third, <HI>Mani-Beloor,</HI> is chief Superintendent over <HI>Chilongo;</HI> and besides that Charge, hath the Office of Searcher over the <HI>Dockies</HI> or Sorcerers, and takes care of such as fall under the <HI>Bondes.</HI></P>
<P>The great Province of <HI>Chilongatiamokango,</HI> as free Lord he rules without ac∣knowledging any subjection to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Mani-Kinga,</HI> is Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Piri;</HI> and <HI>Mani-Matta,</HI> Captain of the Guard; for <HI>Matta</HI> signifies a Bowe, and <HI>Mani</HI> a Prince.</P>
<P>The King, for the better managing of his weighty affairs, hath several other inferior Officers; as <HI>Manidonga,</HI> Governor of <HI>Pattovey</HI> to Guard the King's Wives; two <HI>Manaenders,</HI> that is, Butlers to the King in the day, and two other for the night: <HI>Moeton Ambamma,</HI> servant of the great Captain <HI>Bamma;</HI> with a multitude of others.</P>
<P>Besides all these, the great Butler bears no small sway; his title, <HI>Ma∣bonde-Lovango,</HI> that is, <HI>Upper Butler of Lovango,</HI> for he takes care of all Vyands, and hath four other under him; whereof (as we said) two in the day time, when the King is in the Wine-House; and two in the evening perform their service: and lastly, every division of the Countrey hath a particular Nobleman appointed by the King; as we in Hundreds have Justices of the Peace.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Lovango</HI> hath the repute of a potent Lord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Power of the King.</NOTE> being able to bring numerous Armies into the Field, and that not so much respected, as dreaded by the Kings of <HI>Calongo,</HI> and <HI>Goy;</HI> yet he liveth in friendship with them, and holds good correspondency with those of <HI>Angola;</HI> his Jurisdiction extends into the Countrey Eastward, almost as far as on the Sea Coast, being known by the general name of <HI>Mourisse,</HI> and <HI>Manilovango.</HI></P>
<P>The administration of Justice, and punishing of Vice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice.</NOTE> seems to be according to the Law of Retaliation; for Theft is not punish'd by Death, except it be against the King; but when they take a Thief either in the very act, or after∣wards, the things stoln must be made good by him or his Friends, and the Thief bound, expos'd for a scorn and derision of every one, in the midst of the Street.</P>
<P>If any be found Guilty, whose miserable poverty affords no means of satis∣faction, then may the offended seek remedy, every man of the Tribe or Ge∣neration whereof he was, and make them work for him, till he receive the full recompence of his losses.</P>
<P>The King hath (by the report of the <HI>Blacks</HI>) near seven thousand Wives;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King hath many Wives.</NOTE> for after the decease of one King, his Successor keeps all his Wives, and brings al∣so many besides to them.</P>
<P>These Wives are kept in no great respect; for they must work no less than other women: Some few of them he selects for his Amours, and with them
<PB N="504" REF="318"/>spends much time; the other he shuts up as Nunns in Cloysters.</P>
<P>When one of these proves with Child, one must drink <HI>Bonde</HI> for her, to know whether this Woman hath had to do with any other besides the King. Now if the Man who hath so drank be well, they judge the Woman upright; but if the Man falls, she is condemn'd and burnt, and the Adulterer buried alive.</P>
<P>The King as supream Governor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mother is appropria∣ted for the King.</NOTE> appropriates to himself one to be as a Mo∣ther, a grave Matron, and of good and try'd experience, which they call <HI>Ma∣konda;</HI> whom he reverences with more honour than his own natural Mother. This <HI>Makonda</HI> hath a great prerogative and priviledge, to do good offices both to the Nobility and common People, that fall into the dis-favour of the King; who is necessitated in all weighty affairs to use her Counsel: for she hath such authority,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her Authority.</NOTE> that if the King provokes her any way, and doth not grant her Suit speedily, she may take away his life.</P>
<P>Besides, she takes the advantage (without any daring to controll her) to sa∣tiate her unruly appetite, as often, and with whom she pleases; and what∣ever Children she hath by such means, bears all the same repute that proceeds of the Royal Race: but if her Gallants meddle with other Women, they are by authority of the Law, punished with Death; so that these accounted felici∣ties carry with them their infortune: and if they imagine themselves detected, they have no way to preserve their Lives but by flight.</P>
<P>When the King dies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inheritance of the Crown.</NOTE> his Children succeed not, but the Crown devolves to his eldest Brother; and for want of Brothers, to his Sisters Children.</P>
<P>Such as may pretend any right to the Crown, have their Dwellings in seve∣ral Cities and Towns; and as they come nearer to the Government, the nigher they draw towards <HI>Lovango:</HI> now so soon as the King dies, the Lord which dwelleth in the next Town of all, cometh to the Dominion, and he that dwelleth nearest to him, supplieth his place again, and so on to the last, with this Proviso, that they must be of Noble Blood by the Mothers side.</P>
<P><HI>Mani-Kay,</HI> the first Successor to the Throne, dwelleth in a great City, call'd <HI>Kay,</HI> about a mile and a half, North North-West from <HI>Lovango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Bocke,</HI> the second, dwelleth in a Town four or five miles up into the Countrey, call'd <HI>Bocke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Cellage,</HI> the third, resides in a pretty large Town, by Name <HI>Cellage,</HI> ten or twelve miles Northward of <HI>Lovango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Katt,</HI> the fourth, remains in the Village, about fifteen miles from <HI>Lo∣vango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mani-Injami,</HI> the fifth, holds his Seat in a Hamlet call'd <HI>Injami,</HI> Southwards towards <HI>Calongo.</HI></P>
<P>After the Decease of the old King, <HI>Mani-Kay</HI> succeeded, and <HI>Mani-Bocke</HI> came again in his place, and every one follows his Lot.</P>
<P>The King's youngest Brother hath his Mansion in <HI>Chilasia,</HI> and from thence comes to <HI>Bocke</HI> upon the first Vacancy; and if he hath a Child by his Wife, and have offer'd Sacrifice to their <HI>Cares,</HI> or banish'd Gods, removes to <HI>Kay,</HI> the next place to the Royal Seat.</P>
<P>After the decease of the <HI>Mani-Kay,</HI> immediately enters upon the Government, yet comes not presently into the Court, but continues near six Moneths in his own City, till all Ceremonies of the Burial be perform'd.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Mani</HI> signifies <HI>Lord</HI> or <HI>Prince,</HI> and is the greatest Title of Honour or Expression which they give one among another; the King himself hath the
<PB N="505" REF="318"/>Title of <HI>Mani-Lovango,</HI> which signifies, <HI>Prince of Lovango;</HI> as <HI>Nani-Kay</HI> also signi∣fies, <HI>Lord of Kay; Mani-Bocke, Lord of Bocke.</HI></P>
<P>The King and his Brothers are commonly jealous one of another; for if any one of them happen to be sick, they presently suspect State-policy.</P>
<P>The King commonly wears Cloth or Stuff, which the <HI>Portuguese,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Cloathing.</NOTE> or other <HI>Whites,</HI> bring to them. The King and great Noble-men have on their left Arm the Skin of a wild Cat sew'd together, with one end stuffed round and stiff.</P>
<P>The King hath peculiar Orders and Customs in Eating and Drinking;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs of the King's in Eating and Drinking.</NOTE> for which he keeps two several Houses, one to eat in, and the other to drink in; and although he hath many Houses, yet by vertue of this Custom he may use no other. He makes two Meals a day, the first in the Morning, about ten a Clock; where his Meat is brought in cover'd Baskets, near which a Man goes with a great Bell, to give notice to every one of the coming of the Kings Dishes: whereupon the King, so soon as he is acquainted with it, leaves the Company he is withall, and goes thither. But the Servitors go all away, because none,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s the King Eat must die.</NOTE> neither Man or Beast may see him eat, but it must die; and therefore he eats with his Doors shut. How strictly they observe this Custom, appears by the ensuing relation.</P>
<P>A <HI>Portuguese</HI> of <HI>Lovango,</HI> named <HI>St. Paulo,</HI> lying in <HI>Angola</HI> to Trade, had pre∣sented the King with a brave Dog, which for his faithfulness he loved very much: This Dog, not so strictly look'd to by his Keeper, while the King was eating, ran smelling and seeking after his Master, whom he missed, and came at length, without any body's minding him, to the Door, which with his Nose he thrust open, and went to the King whom he saw eating: but the King caused his Servants instantly with a Rope to put the Dog to death; for be it Man or Child, Mouse, Cat or Dog, or any other living Creature that hath seen the King eat, if it can be gotten, it escapes not death.</P>
<P>It happened, that a Noble-man's Child, about seven or eight years old, who was with his Father in the King's Banquetting-house, fell asleep, and when the King was drinking, awaked; whereupon it was instantly sentenc'd to die, with a reprieve only for six or seven days at the Fathers request; that time elap∣sed, the Child was struck upon the Nose with a Smiths Hammer, and the blood dropped upon the King's <HI>Makisies,</HI> and then with a Cord about his Neck was dragg'd upon the Ground to a broad Way, to which Malefactors are drawn, which cannot bear the trial of the <HI>Bonde.</HI></P>
<P>When the King hath done eating, he goes accompanied in State with the Nobility, Officers, and common People, to his Banquetting-house, the greatest and most sumptuous Structure in all his Court, scituate on a Plain, fenced with Palm-Tree Boughs; wherein the most difficult causes of difference, are decided and determin'd in his presence.</P>
<P>This House stands with the fore-side open,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Banquetting-house.</NOTE> to receive all advantages of the Air; about twenty Foot backward is a Skreen, or Partition, made cross, one side eight Foot broad, and twelve Foot long, where they keep the Palm-Wine, to preserve it from the sight of the People. This Partition hath Hangings from the top to the bottom, of fine Wrought, Tufted, or Quilted Leaves, call'd by them <HI>Kumbel;</HI> close to which appears a <HI>Tial,</HI> or Throne, made with very fine little Pillars of white and black <HI>Palmito</HI>-Branches, artificially Wrought in the manner of Basket-work.</P>
<PB N="506" REF="319"/>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Throne holds in length,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Royal Throne.</NOTE> a Man's Fathom, in heighth, a Foot and a half; and in breadth, two Foot, on each side stand two great Baskets of the same work, made of red and black Wicker, wherein, as the <HI>Blacks</HI> say, the King keeps some familiar Spirits for the Guard of his Person: next him sit on each side a Cup-bearer, he on the right hand reaches him the Cup when he is minded to drink, but the other on the left, onely gives warning to the Peo∣ple, to that end holding in his hands two Iron Rods, about the bigness of a Finger, and pointed at the end, which he strikes one against another; at which sound the People, who are commonly as well within the House as without, with all speed groveling into the Sand with their Faces, and continue in that posture so long as the same Irons continue the voyce or signal, that is, till he hath done drinking, and then they rise up again, and according to custom, signifie that they wish him health, with clapping their hands; which they hold for as great an honour, as with us in <HI>Europe,</HI> the putting off the Hat.</P>
<P>Now as none may see the King Eat or Drink without bazard of death,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">None may see the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> so no Subject may drink in his presence, but must turn his Back towards him. But the King drinks here seldom, except for fashion-sake, and then not till about six a Clock in the Evening, or half an hour later, if any difficult controversie hath been in debate; but sometimes he goes thence at four, and recreates himself among the Wines.</P>
<P>About an hour after Sun-set he comes the second time to the aforemention'd Place to Eat, where again as before, his Meal is made ready. After which he vi∣sits his Banquetting-house again, where he remains for about nine hours, some∣times not so long, as he finds himself dispos'd or indispos'd: In the night one or two Torches are carried before him to Light him.</P>
<P>None may drink out of his Cup besides himself; nor any eat of the Food he hath tasted, but the remainder must be buried in the Earth.</P>
<P>The King never comes abroad but upon a remarkable Day,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> that is, when an Ambassador addresses from some Foreign Prince, or some strange accident hath

For this his Appearance there is a place appointed opposite to his Court, being an even and great Plain, in the midst of the City.</P>
<P>The Stool, or Seat whereon he then sits, stands raised upon a Foot-pace,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Seat.</NOTE> dressed with white and black Wickers, very artificially Woven, and other sorts of curious adornings; behind his Back hangs on a Pole a Shield, cover'd with divers party-colour'd Stuffs, brought out of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Near him stand also six or eight Fanns, by them call'd <HI>Pos,</HI> or <HI>Mani,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fanne.</NOTE> and con∣taining in length and breadth half a Fathom, at the upper end of a long Stick which runs through the middle of it, having a round Brim, in form of a half Globe fasten'd, interwoven with little Horns, and with white and black Par∣rots Feathers between: Those Fanns certain People, which the King keeps for that purpose, move with great force, which agitating the Air, causes a refresh∣ing and pleasant coolness.</P>
<P>Before the King's Seat lieth spread a great Cloth twenty Fathom long, and twelve broad, made of quilted Leaves sew'd together, upon which none may go but the King and his Children; but round it they leave room for two or three persons to pass by, the Nobility sitting in long Ranks, every one with a Buffles Tail in his Hand, which for the most part they move in the presence of the King: Some sit upon the bare Ground; others upon Cloathes made of the same Stuff with the King's: Behind them stand the People; as behind the King all his great Officers, not few in number.</P>
<P>In this publick Solemnity of State,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Playing Instruments.</NOTE> there are some that very curiously Play upon several Instruments of Musick, of which they use three sorts; first, Wind-Instruments, made of Ivory in the shape of a Hunting-Horn, hollow'd as deep as possible, with a hole at the great end, and an Inch and a half, or two Inches broad: Of these they have several sorts, eight or ten whereof joyn'd in consort yield a pleasant sound.</P>
<PB N="508" REF="320"/>
<P>The second sort are Drums, made of whole hollowed Pieces of Timber, covered over at one end with Leather, or Skins of Wild Beasts, and at the other end with a small Opening, in which may be put two Fingers. They bear com∣monly on four of these together, sometimes striking with the Palms of the Hands flat-ways, sometimes with one Stick and one Hand.</P>
<P>The third resembles a Pan or Sieve, such as they use for Meal, but the Wood bigger and deeper; round about which are some long Holes cut, two and two together, each about a Fingers length: In each Hole they put two Copper Plates, fastned to the Wood with Copper Pins. This Instrument being stirred, gives a sound almost like the tinckling of little Bells on the Wheels.</P>
<P>At this time many of the Nobility salute the King,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Noble-men sa∣lute the King with leaping.</NOTE> leaping after a manner which they call <HI>Chilomba,</HI> which they do with great wide Paces and Strides, along by the void spaces of the Cloth spread upon the rising Foot-pace; this they perform backward and forward two or three times, moving their Arms this way and that way: Leaping thus, the King and his Nobles receive them with out-stretched Arms, and they clap together their Hands two or three times, and then cast themselves just at the King's Feet into the Sand, and rowl over and over in it, in token of Subjection. Such as are extraordinary Favourites, ha∣ving performed this Exercise, run directly to the King, and leaning with both Hands upon his Knees, lay their Heads in his Bosom.</P>
<P>The Chiefest Noble-men have a Seat separate from the King's, to which, for their greater Honor, some of the inferior Subjects make the like Leaping; and sometimes also not only one Noble-man salutes another so, but the King him∣self, though seldom, uses it.</P>
<P>Before the running Passage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cryers.</NOTE> about the King's Seat, stand three or four Cryers, with Instruments in their Hands of the fashion of Sheeps-bells, but thick and heavy of Iron, upon which they strike with a Stick, to give notice of Silence or Quietness, from whence proceeds a dull and hoarse sound. These Cryers are also Officers of the City, to proclaim the Orders of the King, as also to signifie when any thing is lost or found.</P>
<P>They have no <HI>decorum</HI> of Modesty or Civil Deportment; but shamelesly, in what Company soever, even in the King's presence, discover their Nakedness before and behind, in their unseemly and barbarous Dances.</P>
<P>Before the King's Cloth sit some Dwarfs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Before the Kings Cloth sit Dwarfs.</NOTE> with their backs towards him; Pigmies indeed in Stature, but with Heads of a prodigious bigness: for the more exact deforming whereof, they wear the Skin of some Beast tied round about them. The <HI>Blacks</HI> say there is a Wilderness, where reside none but Men of such a Stature, who shoot those Gigantick Creatures the Elephants. The common Name of these Dwarfs is <HI>Bakke Bakke;</HI> but they are also call'd <HI>Mimo's.</HI></P>
<P>There sit also certain White Men by the King,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Complexion.</NOTE> with Skins on their Heads, and indeed at distance seem like our <HI>Europeans,</HI> having not only gray Eyes, but red or yellow Hair; yet coming nearer, the discovery grows easie: For they have not a lively Colour, but white, like the Skin of a dead Corps, and their Eyes as it were fixed in their Heads, like people that lie a dying: The sight they have is but weak and dim, turning the Eye like such as look asquint; but at night they see strongly, especially by Moon-shine.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion that these white <HI>Moors</HI> ought to be accounted Fairies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Generating.</NOTE> and to have sprung from a great-bellied <HI>Black</HI> with Child, upon seeing a <HI>White;</HI> as we read, That a white Woman being Pregnant, upon the seeing a Picture of a
<PB N="509" REF="320"/>black <HI>Moor,</HI> brought forth a black Child. However this seems worthy remark, if true, as reported, That these <HI>Whites</HI> of either Sex are incapable of Coition.</P>
<P>But <HI>Isaac Vossius,</HI> in his Book of the Original of <HI>Nile,</HI> and other Rivers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voscius lib. de Orig Nili. &amp; lior. Fluminum.</NOTE> saith, Though this sort of Men be generated of black Parents, yet is it proba∣ble, that in the Mid-land Countreys of <HI>Guinee,</HI> People may be found of the like white Colour: And in my Judgment (continues he) it may be concluded, That they are a kind of Leapers, and the difference of Colour proceeds from a Sickness common among the <HI>Moors,</HI> especially those that dwell in dry and hot places; for if these did not continually anoint the Skin, they would all perhaps be afflicted with the same Evil: For this cause there passeth no day among them without anointing, for which they use not only Oyl, but Fat, and Oyntments, wherewith they smear all their Bodies over, and by that means not only prevent the parching of their Skin, but makes it of a shining black, the chiefest Beauty with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> call these white <HI>Moors, Albinoes,</HI> and attempted to take some of them Prisoners in the Wars, and carry them over to <HI>Brasile</HI> to work; for they are very strong, but so addicted to idleness, that they had rather die than un∣dertake any toylsom Labour.</P>
<P>The like sort of Men have been found by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> not only in <HI>Africa,</HI> but also in <HI>East-India,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Borneo,</HI> and in <HI>New Guince,</HI> call'd the Countrey of <HI>Papos.</HI> Thus far <HI>Vossius.</HI></P>
<P>The King useth them in most of his Religious Ceremonies, as in making <HI>Mokisies,</HI> from whence themselves have generally that Name among the Inha∣bitants, which in our Language properly signifies <HI>Field-devils.</HI></P>
<P>This Solemn Appearance of the King in Publick, begins commonly about three a clock in the Afternoon, and continues till about four or five.</P>
<P>All the Wives of the Subjects of this Realm must yearly, from the first to the fourth of <HI>January,</HI> being the Seed-time, break his Land to be sown; for the space of about two hours going in length, and one hour in breadth: but the Men are then most of them in Arms, and in their best Habits, going constant∣ly to and fro, to warn the Women to work, and to take care that no violence be done to any.</P>
<P>Here also the King shews himself at three a clock after noon, in his highest State, to encourage them to work; and in the Evening they all eat at his Charge: So that those days are accounted high Festivals.</P>
<P>In like manner must every Noble-mans Subjects, with their Women, Till their Land: And when they have performed these Services, then they may go work for themselves. And as we have heretofore declared, Every one may Till what Ground he will; but that which one hath cultivated, another may not meddle withal.</P>
<P>If any Embassador,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Embassadors or No∣ble-men speak to the King.</NOTE> or Noble-man of the Countrey desire to speak to the King in Person, they must first give notice thereof with the sound of two or three Hand-clappers, which every one present in like manner answers; then the Suppliant cries out aloud, <HI>Empoo lausan biau Pongo,</HI> that is, <HI>Hearken for Gods sake;</HI> whereto the People about him answer, and speak, <HI>Tiesambie Zinga,</HI> which sig∣nifies, <HI>Long live God:</HI> After which the Petitioner begins his Speech with the word <HI>Wag,</HI> usual among them; and ends with the words <HI>In Mama, Wag,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>I herewith conclude:</HI> Whereupon those that have any thing to say against it, begin and end in the same manner. And this form of Speech they use in all their Matters of Justice, Warrants, and Orders of the King.</P>
<PB N="510" REF="321"/>
<P>When any Noble-man hath shot a Leopard,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is done when a Leo∣pard is taken.</NOTE> he brings as a token of it, the Tail to the King, upon the top of a <HI>Palmeto</HI> Pole, and pitches it in the Earth, and this without any noise or further ceremony.</P>
<P>When the Inhabitants of <HI>Lovango</HI> have lodged a Leopard in the Woods, every one is warned by the sound of Trumpet to be ready to attend the King at the Game. If it be far without the City into the Woods, the King is carried in a four-square Seat, about two Foot deep, made of black Tin, and artificially wrought, by four Men, two before and two behind, holding two Poles, on each side one, covered with blue Cloth. Being come to the Leo∣pards Den, they instantly beset it round, every one being ready prepared, some with Bowes and Arrows, and others with Lances and Darts.</P>
<P>Before the King, standing a little elevated, they spread long Cord-Nets; incircled by the People, that to rowse the Beast, make many strange and un∣couth noises, with Horns, Drums, Shouting, and the like; but at last having in vain tried all means of escape, tired out and overpower'd with multitude, he falls a Prey to his eager Pursuers, who forthwith bring him into the Plain before the King's Palace, where the Hunters triumph over the Carcase with Dancing, Leaping, and Singing, and all kinds of Revelling Pastimes.</P>
<P>Afterwards the King appoints divers Noble-men to oversee the Stripping of the Leopard, and bring the Skin to him; but the Flesh, together with the Bowels, the Gaul only taken out, they bury very deep in the Earth, that it may not be digged up again.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Leopards Gaul is Poyson.</NOTE> The Gaul, which they reckon to be a most venomous Poyson, they cut up in the presence of many, and fling into the midst of a River, that none might make use thereof to the damage of another.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies at the Funeral of a King are these:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funeral of the Kings</NOTE> First they make Vaults under ground, wherein they place the dead King in his richest Habit, upon a Stool, and by him all manner of Houshold-stuff, as Pots, Kettles, Pans, Clothes, and Garments.</P>
<P>Then they make many little Images of Wood and Red Earth, and set round about the Corps, Representatives of his Servants and Houshold-goods.</P>
<P>Next, the Bodies of many Slaves are set by the Corps, either in the same or some adjoyning Vault, to serve the King, as they believe, in the other World, and to shew when they shall come to the great Monarch, what manner of Per∣son he has been here: for they believe after this another Life, yet in general deride the Resurrection of the Dead.</P>
<P>The Commons shew themselves very humble to the Nobility;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nobility are very much honor'd.</NOTE> for at the meeting of them in the Streets, they fall down upon their Knees, turning their Head another way, signifying thereby, that they are not worthy to look upon such: yet when he speaks, then they speak again: So that we may not without Reason affirm, That they are little better than Slaves, beyond whom priviledg'd only in this, that they may at pleasure pass into any other Countrey, which a Slave without leave cannot do.</P>
<P>Noble-men of State have usually, besides their Mansion-Houses, also a Wine-Cellar, as hath been said before concerning the King; where they spend some part of the Day and the Evening in Eating and Drinking; some days they have two, three, four, and well near eight <HI>Callabasses</HI> of Wine of Palm; of which they impart some quantity to their Women, but the rest they drink with their Subjects.</P>
<P>Their Diet is commonly brought thither to them, whereof every one pre∣sent may take his part.</P>
<PB N="511" REF="321"/>
<P>In like manner, whoever hath any Cause, may daily come and speak with a Nobleman, there being (as it were) a publick place of receipt, and where pet∣ty Differences arising between parties, are heard and determin'd.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Kingdoms of <HI>Lovango, Kakongo,</HI> and <HI>Goij,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion, or Worship.</NOTE> have no knowledge of God at all, or his Word, but onely the bare Name, which their Language denominates <HI>Sambian Ponge,</HI> but neither care nor desire to learn more.</P>
<P>All acts of Devotion they perform to the Field, and House-Devils,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Field-Devils are pray'd unto by those of <HI>Lovange.</HI></NOTE> represen∣ted under the shapes of Idols, of which they have great numbers; to each of whom they give a peculiar name, according as they attribute to them power, having their distinct Jurisdiction: to some they ascribe the power of Lightning; and the Wind; and also to serve as Scar-Crows, to preserve their Corn from Fowl, and other Vermin; to one they give the command over Fishes of the Sea; to another, over the Fishes in the River; to a third, over the Cattel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some they make protectors of their health and safety; others, to avert evils and misfortunes: to this, as an expert Oculist, they commend the charge of their sight; of that they desire instruction in the mysteries of hidden Arts, and to be able, even to fore-judge destiny; neither do they believe them at large, but circumscribe them to limited places,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what shapes they shew themselves.</NOTE> and shew their Figures in several shapes; some of Images, like men; others of Poles, with small irons on the top, or else a little Carv'd Picture; some of which shapes or representations, they carry commonly with them when they travel from one place to another. Their greater Idols are stuck with Hens or Pheasants Feathers upon their heads, and with all sorts of Tassils and Fassils about their bodies: Some make them in the fashion of long Slips, which they wear about their necks and arms; others of Cords, trimm'd with small Feathers, and two or three <HI>Simbos,</HI> or small Horns, with which they adorn their middle, neck and arms: some are nothing but Pots fill'd with white earth; others, <HI>Buffels</HI> Horns, stuffed with the same matter; and at the small end, having Iron Rings.</P>
<P>They yet make another sort more ridiculous than any of the former; the manner thus: They take an ordinary round Pot without feet, which they fill with red and white earth, kneaded together with water, a pretty heighth above the upper edges, which they mark on the outside quite round with white streaks, and stripe it upon the top, with variety of Colours.</P>
<P>One of these Idols (as they say) is jealous of another, insomuch,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several of their Idolgods are Field-Devils.</NOTE> that when they have made one, they presently go to work upon another; and several times are necessitated to make many, lest they should offend such as seem to be neglected, still making their addresses to all, with equal indifferency, as their Protectors and Guardians.</P>
<P>They have to instruct them in the making these Idols, particular Masters, in their Language call'd <HI>Enganga Mokise;</HI> whose skill therein they much admire, being put in practise in this following manner.</P>
<P>First, the Person being advis'd thereto by the aforemention'd <HI>Enganga Mokise,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they make their <HI>Mo∣kise.</HI></NOTE> or Conjurer, invites, for the furthering of the Work, their whole Tribe, Ac∣quaintance, Relations, and Neighbors, to assemble together: then the Inviter makes for his <HI>Mokise</HI> (as they term it) a house of Palm-Boughs, wherein he con∣tinues the space of fifteen days, nine of which he must not speak; and during the whole time, have no converse with any body.</P>
<P>On each side of his mouth he wears a Parrets feather; and may not clap his hands if any one salute him, but as a sign of greeting, strikes with a small
<PB N="512" REF="322"/>upon a Block in his hand, made sloaping, narrow at the top, and in the middle hollow, and on the end a Mans head Carv'd: Of these Blocks, this Devil-Hunter hath three sorts; one great, the other of a middle size, and the other small.</P>
<P>These prepar'd and made ready, a Fellow brings a Drum to a plain place, whereon no Trees grow, about whom all the Undertakers, Friends and Relati∣ons, make a Ring; whereupon the Drummer standing in the middle, begins to beat, and sing before the Conjurer, who begins to Dance, followed by every one, while he with an open throat, chants forth the praises of the <HI>Mokise,</HI> de∣siring his aid; the Undertaker also (if in health) Dances about the Drum, two or three days, without perceiving any thing of the Devil all that time.</P>
<P>At length the Devil-hunter presents himself near the Undertaker, with hide∣ous noises and outcries, yet nothing visible all this while, onely the Drum∣ming ceases a little; and then the <HI>Enganga</HI> strikes upon the aforemention'd Blocks, speaking some words, and making sometimes red and white spots in several parts of the Undertakers body, <HI>viz.</HI> on his Temples and Eye-lids, the pit or hollow of his Stomach, and every Limb, to make him capable of en∣tertaining the evil Spirit.</P>
<P>Being possess'd, he makes ugly wry faces, and stretching his body in un∣seemly postures, with terrible shreeks, takes fire in his hands, and bites with∣out hurting himself; sometimes their Devils take him away from them all, and carry him into the wilderness to some desolate place, where he sticks over his whole body green Leaves: During this absence, which hath no set time of continuance, his friends use all possible endeavors to find him out, but in vain. This they perform with Drums, which they beat all the time, the noise whereof, having reach'd the ears of the Possess'd, he betakes himself thither, and so is carry'd again to his house.</P>
<P>The Devil being thus entred, and he Possess'd, he lieth as it were dead; then the Conjurer asketh what shall be inflicted upon him? whereto the Spirit makes answer, by the mouth of the Possess'd, and lays his injunction upon him: upon this they begin again to sing and to dance, till the Devil comes out of him again; then a Ring is put about his Arms, to put him in remem∣brance of his task.</P>
<P>When these people Swear, they Swear by this Ring, wishing, <HI>That Devil who causeth them to wear this Ring, may break their necks if it be not true;</HI> which is the sooner believed, because they will not swear lightly, nor to any thing but the truth; they infallibly keep their words in what they promise, though to the hazard of their lives, as hath often appear'd. When the Devil speaks out of the Possess'd, which oftentimes happens, he endureth great pain, being thrown from one side to another, and frothing at the mouth.</P>
<P>There are yet other <HI>Mokisies,</HI> in different manners, which we will relate in short: When any one amongst them grows sick, they use to cry or call upon their Devil, till he enters into the sick man; and then they demand why this man is sick? whether he has broke his commandments? and many more such like questions; whereupon the Spirit answers out of the mouth of the sick, and is immediately by promise of some gifts, hired to effect his cure.</P>
<P>They hold several opinions concerning the soul;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An opinion concerning mans soul.</NOTE> for those of the King's fa∣mily believes, that the soul when any one dies, is born again in some of the same family; others, that the soul and body have one determinate end; some, like the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romanes,</HI> place the soul among the Hero's, or else bring them
<PB N="513" REF="322"/>into the number of their Tutelar <HI>Lars;</HI> others give them a common place of resort, under the earth; while another sort make for them little Receptacles un∣der the Roof of their Houses, about a span in heighth; before which places, when they eat or drink, they make some offering.</P>
<P>They further believe, that none can die of a natural death,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They believe a man can∣not die a natural death.</NOTE> but all come to their end by mischance, that the Insiliator hath some hidden place, where he not onely effects clandestinely his desires, but also by the power of Conjura∣tion, may ask the deceas'd to come out of the grave, and keep him for his ser∣vice: These (as they say) are fed daily by the Conjurers, with food boyl'd without any Salt; for if any Salt should come in or near it, the body would follow him openly.</P>
<P>They make it an Article of the highest Faith, that when a <HI>Mokisie</HI> offends, or that injunctions or promises made to him, are not fully perform'd, that he hath power to kill. Now the reason of these promises happens upon various occasions; when a child is born, they call a <HI>Fetisiro</HI> to it,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the injunction is made.</NOTE> to enjoyn the child somewhat to keep as a law; and this they not onely do to every individual person, but to whole Tribes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fetisero</HI> asks the Parents of the child, what their injunction is, and their Ancestors; then he proposes somewhat, saying, the Oracle, by the <HI>Fetisie,</HI> has given him to know, that the child shall have such an injunction, not to do so and so; wherein the Mother takes care to instruct the child from its youth, that when it shall come to years, it may be able to keep it.</P>
<P>These injunctions are manifold, as that they may eat no such Flesh, Herbs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Injunctions, how manifold they are.</NOTE> nor Fruits, or eating thereof, they must eat it alone, leaving none, and besides bury the bones in the ground, that they may not be scrap'd up again, and eaten by any Dog, Cat, or other living Creature.</P>
<P>Some are enjoyn'd not to go over any water; others may not pass over a River with a <HI>Canoo,</HI> yet admitted to walk, swim, or ride thorow: some must not shave the hair of the Head; others may, as also their Beards; which again in divers, is an offence beyond pardon.</P>
<P>Several are commanded to forbear all Fruits; indulging to others a liberty to devour all, yet again restraining many.</P>
<P>In relation to Garments the commands are general;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Injunctions about mens Clothes.</NOTE> for all men must wear a Girdle made of the skin of some living Creature, which must be fasten'd in a peculiar manner above their Belly; Caps upon their heads, or else in stead thereof, a Cord or some Covering of Clothes call'd <HI>Libonges,</HI> or otherwise.</P>
<P>The Women must go with their heads always uncover'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Women.</NOTE> and wear four or five Clothes of <HI>Kimbi,</HI> or <HI>Sambes</HI> or <HI>Libonges</HI> sew'd together, beneath their Waste, before the Belly, in stead of a Girdle.</P>
<P>When a man at any time comes into a house, and sits down unawares upon the corner of a Bed, wherein a man and woman have lain together, when he hath receiv'd information of his fault, he must go instantly to a Smith, which commonly sit with their tackling under the open heaven, and tell him the cause of his coming, who then blows up a fire, and taking him by the little finger of his left hand, turns it over his head; then striking two or three strokes with his Hammer, and blowing with his mouth upon his hands put together, he pro∣nounces some words with a low voice, wherewith the promise unwittingly transgress'd is cleans'd. This ceremony they call <HI>Vempa-Momba,</HI> that is, <HI>A Bene∣diction, or Purification.</HI></P>
<PB N="514" REF="323"/>
<P>If an unmarry'd man have gotten a foolish child, he may not eat of the breast or udder of a <HI>Buffle;</HI> but by getting another more witty, becomes free again, to eat as at first.</P>
<P>These and the like Fopperies they observe with all exactness;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vertue ascrib'd to these Injunctions.</NOTE> believing that none have any sickness, sorrow, or affliction, but for breaking the same.</P>
<P>Now because the word <HI>Mokisie</HI> will sometime be mention'd, it is necessary to shew the meaning thereof, and how they use it.</P>
<P>By the word <HI>Mokisie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">What <HI>Mokisie</HI> fignifies.</NOTE> they mean a natural Superstition, and firm Perswasion that they have of something, to which they ascribe an invisible power, in working good to their advantage, or evil to their prejudice and detriment, or from whom they expect to learn the knowledge of past or future things. It can∣not properly be call'd Idolatry, because these people have no knowledge of any Deity, or Diabolical Spirit, having no particular name for the Devil, one∣ly call all <HI>Mokisie,</HI> where they suppose an over-ruling power.</P>
<P>Whatever they effect by it,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vanity of the <HI>Mokisie.</HI></NOTE> is done by meer imagination, or if by natural means, it happens more by chance, than any knowledge they have. Any man that is sound, and determines to live after the manner of his <HI>Mokisie,</HI> observing temperance and chastity, takes the natural course to preserve his health; but their ignorant stupidity ascribes it to the operation of the <HI>Mokisie.</HI> On the other hand, if any be sick, and use means for the recovery of health, the good success thereof the <HI>Mokisie</HI> gets the praise of, although the cause of the sickness were re∣mov'd by the goodness and bounty of nature, or the strength of his constitu∣tion. But if the person by the violence of the sickness happen to die, they cer∣tainly believe him kill'd by Sorcery, for transgressing against his <HI>Mokisies.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient use of this Common Custom, seems an infallible demonstrati∣on to the besotted people, of the great vertue of the <HI>Mokisies,</HI> and it confirms them not a little in their foolish belief, because they see their King and the Grandees of the Countrey, make it their work.</P>
<P>The King hath the general stile of <HI>Mani-Lovango,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the King is call'd <HI>Mo∣kisie.</HI></NOTE> but the people call him <HI>Mo∣kisie,</HI> because he hath (as they say) a great power to kill any body with a word speaking, and can spoil the whole Countrey; and prefer and put down, make rich, or poor at his pleasure; cause rain; transhape or metamorphose him∣self into the shape of a beast, and innumerable such like; which all serve to ma∣nifest his greatness, and strike an awe into the Subjects of his Potency.</P>
<P>Thus also it stands with the other Lords,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The higher a man is, the more <HI>Mokisies</HI> he hath.</NOTE> whose might, honor, and esteem, grows from the same root.</P>
<P>As for example, the King's Sister, as soon as she hath a child, holds by as∣signment the Village <HI>Kine</HI> for a dwelling-place, and may not eat Hogs flesh: when the child hath attain'd age and growth, it visits the <HI>Moansa,</HI> and dares not eat the fruit call'd <HI>Kola</HI> with company, but onely alone: Afterwards it go∣eth by the <HI>Ganga, Simeka,</HI> and then it dare eat no sort of Poultry, but those kill'd, and boyl'd by himself, and must bury the remainder; when he comes in <HI>Sal∣lasy,</HI> he hath other and more <HI>Mokisies;</HI> and so in <HI>Boeka,</HI> and <HI>Kaye,</HI> till brought to the King. Then is he advanc'd in all power and wisdom, as having in ima∣gination, attain'd the active intelligence of the <HI>Mokisies.</HI></P>
<P>All Conjurers and Priests are call'd <HI>Ganga,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Conjurers are call'd <HI>Ganga.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Ganga Mokisie;</HI> otherwise <HI>Gan∣ga Thiriko, Ganga Boesy-batta, Ganga Kyzokoo, Ganga Bombo, Ganga Makemba, Ganga Makongo, Ganga Nijmy, Ganga Kossy, Ganga Kymaye, Ganga Injami, Ganga Kytouba, Pansa, Pongo,</HI> and <HI>Mansy,</HI> and innumerable other such names, either given to, or assum'd by them from the <HI>Mokisies</HI> they serve.</P>

The <HI>Ganga</HI> of this <HI>Mokisie,</HI> being Lord of the Village, performs every morning his Service and Ceremony, with some words and Conjurations; being answer'd in the mean time by a youth that stands by him; this <HI>Ganga</HI> commends to his <HI>Moki∣sus</HI> the health of the King; the wellfare of the Countrey; the good flourish∣ing of the Seed; success for the Merchants; and full Nets for Fishermen.

<P>To this they add, two Baskets thick cover'd with Shells, Feathers, Iron Hooks, and an Herb fetcht from a far distant Mountain; in which they cut a hole where they pour in Wine, of which they give often to drink.</P>
<P>The simplicity of the <HI>Maujeres</HI> deserves well to be laugh'd at, for when they bring any thing upon the account of Trade, into another Countrey from home, perhaps forty or fifty miles, they must have such a Sack of Trumpery, which sometimes weighs ten or-twelve pounds, aloft upon their Pack, though the bur∣den it self makes them ready to sink under it; But they say, that it rather takes from, than adds to their carriage; whereby it appears, what effects the strength of imagination can do.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of their Publick Devotions are strange and ridiculous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the service of these <HI>Mokisies</HI> is perform'd.</NOTE> for in the first place they bring forth a Bag of Jewels; then the <HI>Ganga</HI> sits down up∣on a Mat, and with a Leather Bag, thumps upon his Knee, having always some little Iron Bells betwixt his fingers; then again he strikes upon his breast, and paints with red and white upon his Eye-lids; Body and Face, using many strange motions and postures of their Body, Hands, Head and Eyes; now raising the voice to a high pitch, then depressing it, frequently speaking the word <HI>Mariomena;</HI> whereupon, those that sit round about, with all the rest of the assembly answer <HI>Ka.</HI></P>
<P>After this hath continu'd a great space, the <HI>Ganga</HI> or Conjurer begins to turn his Eyes, and look as if he were distracted, so that they must hold him; but by vertue of a fowr Water, or Juyce drawn from Cane, wherewith they sprinkle him; recovering, he tells what he hath receiv'd from <HI>Boesy-batta,</HI> and what must be done in such and such cases; as of theft, sickness, and the like.</P>
<P>Besides this, they use so many other Cheats and Delusions, that if we should but name them, would swell to a bulk too Voluminous for our Design.</P>
<P><HI>Lykokoo,</HI> is a black Woodden Image, cut in the shape of a Man sitting; and in <HI>Kinga,</HI> a Town lying by the Sea-Coast, where they have a common Burial∣place, they recite a thousand ridiculous Rhymes concerning this <HI>Kikokoo;</HI> As,
<PB N="516" REF="324"/>That he preserves them from Death;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorcerers, or <HI>Doojes.</HI></NOTE> That he keeps them from hurt by Sorce∣rers, or <HI>Doojes,</HI> as they call them; That he makes the Dead arise out of the Graves in the Night, and forces them to labor, by going to the Shore, and helping to catch Fish, and to drive the <HI>Canoos</HI> in the Water, and in the Day hunts them to their Graves again; and the like Fictions, which the elder Folks make the young believe, and imprint it in them from their Infancy.</P>
<P>It happ'ned once formerly, that some Mariners of a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship, that went to <HI>Lovango,</HI> in the Night stole <HI>Kikokoo</HI> out of his House, and brought it on Board, and in the way an Arm and the Head brake off: But having occasions afterwards to go to <HI>Lovango</HI> again, they durst not venture thither, without re∣storing <HI>Kikokoo:</HI> So nailing the Head and Arm again fast to the Trunk, and being come upon the Road, they set him in the dead of the Night into his House again. The next day there arose a Report among the <HI>Blacks,</HI> That <HI>Ki∣kokoo</HI> was in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and that a Ship with Goods had taken him away. After∣wards there came by mishap a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship to strike upon the Rocks of <HI>Lo∣vango,</HI> whereupon they cried, That <HI>Kikokoo</HI> had broken the Ship, because the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had driven a Nail into his Head. Thus they are taught at every turn to defend the Honor of the <HI>Moquisies,</HI> and to misapply every Accident, for con∣firmation of their Folly.</P>
<P>When the Bonfires of <HI>Bomba</HI> are made, they lay many Drums upon the ground, which they beat with their hands and feet, sitting round about a Post that is set in the middle; among which the Daughters of <HI>Kimbos-bombos</HI> all dance, moving their Bodies, Eyes, and Head, like mad Folks; and with ob∣scene Postures, sing certain Verses, wearing upon their Heads a Bush of all sorts of colour'd Feathers, and on their Bodies strange fashion'd Garments, with a red and white painted Rattle in each Hand. In brief, The more apishly they behave themselves, the freer and braver they are esteem'd to be. A thousand more ridiculous and bestial Ceremonies these shameless <HI>Gangaes</HI> practice at their Bonfires, mocking their <HI>Moquisies,</HI> and dare do whatsoever they think con∣venient.</P>
<P><HI>Malemba</HI> is a <HI>Moquisie</HI> of great esteem, and serves to support the King's Health. It is a Mat of about a Foot and half square, with a Band at the top, upon which hang some small Baskets, Scallops, Feathers, dry'd Pipes of <HI>Cassia,</HI> Iron Bells, Rattles, Bones, and other such like Trinkets, all painted red with <HI>Takoel.</HI> The Ceremonies belonging to this are performed with little Drums or Tabers, upon which a Boy strikes with his Hand. Afterwards some Painting of <HI>Takoel</HI> and Holy-water, taken out of a Pot with a Brush, is sprinkled upon the <HI>Ganga's</HI> and King's Body, with a Song of Probation serving to the purpose. Also the Nobility, which peep, have for their pains, out of the same Pot, a red Streak put upon their Bodies, and have afterwards the Honor to carry away <HI>Malemba,</HI> with his Pots, Brushes, and Cans, and to hang them in their Places.</P>
<P><HI>Moquisie Makongo</HI> they solemnize with Rattles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makongo.</NOTE> Drums, small Wicker-baskets, and Red-colour'd Fish-hooks; but not worth farther mentioning, being all foppery.</P>
<P><HI>Moquisie Mymy</HI> is a little Hut,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mymy.</NOTE> that stands on the back of a Way planted round with <HI>Banano's, Bakovens,</HI> and other Trees, having an elevated <HI>Tial</HI> or Throne, upon which a Basket stands full of all sorts of Trumpery, not worth naming. The chiefest is a Bracelet of Beads, with some little Shells found on the Sea∣coast, by which there hangs a hollowed piece of Wood, upon which they
<PB N="517" REF="324"/>knock. No <HI>Black,</HI> who hath companied with his Wife that Night, dare be so bold as to touch this <HI>Moquisie,</HI> such an Esteem they bear to it.</P>
<P><HI>Moquisie Kossie,</HI> is a Sack with some Horns, full of Whiting, and other <HI>Aragh.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kossy.</NOTE> The Service is performed with Rattles, long Sticks, singing uncouth Songs in the Night, creeping upon their Knees, Washing, Spitting, Shouting, tying Rings and Bands about their Bodies, and such like things: This they boast as an infallible Preservative against Thunder and Lightning, and to prevent Sicknesses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moquisie Kymaye</HI> is a Town close by <HI>Boarye,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kymaye.</NOTE> and consists of old Pot∣sheards, rotten Blocks, whereupon they set Caps, and worn Rags; so that the appearance of this <HI>Ganga</HI> seems a Frippery of old Patches and Tatters. The <HI>Ganga</HI> plays with the Jugling-Box, painted white, knocks with a new Cap full of Stones, blows in his Hands, strikes his Arms and Navel, sits upon a Skin, and is a rare Physician for those that are well. He makes it rain (surely a strange thing!) in <HI>December, January, February, March, April,</HI> nay till <HI>May.</HI> He takes care of the Sea, Fishery, <HI>Canoos,</HI> and for other things, accompting himself a <HI>Kykokas</HI> Fellow.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moquisie Injami</HI> stands about six Miles Southerly from <HI>Lovango,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Injamy.</NOTE> and is also a great Image, standing in a Hut: Hither they Journey from East to West, passing by the way over a round Hill, which none must ride or be carried over, but must go on foot; for otherwise they pollute it.</P>
<P><HI>Kitouba</HI> is a great wooden Rattle, upon which they take an Oath,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kitouba.</NOTE> not to make any sick, to bewitch them, or use other wickedness.</P>
<P><HI>Panza</HI> is a Stick like a Halberd, with a carved Head,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Panza.</NOTE> and daub'd with Red Colouring.</P>
<P><HI>Pongo</HI> is a Basket covered all over with <HI>Simbos,</HI> and conceited Carvings,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pongo.</NOTE> and full or Trifles. It serves also for Witchcraft.</P>
<P><HI>Moanzy</HI> is a Pot buried in the Ground, between some spreading Trees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meanzy.</NOTE> with an Arrow stuck in it, and a Rope strethed over it, on which some Leaves hang. They which go about with this Pot, wear a Copper Armlet, may eat <HI>Kola,</HI> but with no Company, and the like Fopperies. These, and a multitude of other more <HI>Moquisies</HI> they have, which every one in particular observe exactly; so that none may drink out of anothers Cup in the Market-place, being kept in a common Inn or Toping-house, where both Men and Women in great Com∣panies tipple Palm-wine.</P>
<P>Every Male they Circumcise, more out of Custom than Injunction;

<PB N="518" REF="325"/>In a word, <HI>Philippus Pigafet</HI> dilates it from the River <HI>Zaire</HI> to <HI>Nubia:</HI> But <HI>Janik</HI> gives it for Borders the Kingdom of <HI>Kongo,</HI> without naming any other Countreys that touch upon it either East or West.</P>
<P>Here grow two sorts of <HI>Sandal-wood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of <HI>Sandal-wood.</HI></NOTE> viz.</HI> Red, call'd <HI>Tawilla;</HI> and White, <HI>Zikengo;</HI> with which last, being the best, beaten to Powder, and mixt with Palm-oyl, the Inhabitants anoint their Bodies, for the preservation of Health. The People boast of rich Copper Mines, whose Metal they furnish the King∣dom of <HI>Kongo</HI> with.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> The Woods breed Lions, and many other Beasts, com∣mon with <HI>Lovango.</HI></P>
<P>The Natives in general are a nimble,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitution of the Inha∣bitants.</NOTE> active, and well-shap'd People, climb∣ing the craggy Mountains with notable agility.</P>
<P>They take little care for their Living, and dare undertake any thing, with∣out apprehension or fear of Danger; among themselves unanimous; to Strangers, with whom conversing, upright and true-hearted: but they have, by reason of their Beastial Nature, little Trade with the <HI>Whites.</HI></P>
<P>Their common Food is Mens Flesh;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> insomuch that their Markets are pro∣vided with that, as ours in <HI>Europe</HI> with Beef or Mutton: All Prisoners of Wars, unless they can sell them alive with greater advantage; otherwise, as we said, they fatten them for Slaughter, and at last sell them to Butchers, to accommodate the Markets.</P>
<P>To this Savage Barbarity they are so naturaliz'd, that some Slaves, whether as weary of their Lives, or to shew their Love to their Masters, will proffer themselves freely to be kill'd and eaten. But that which is most inhumane, and beyond the ferity of Beasts, is, that the Father matters not to eat his Son, nor the Son his Father, nor one Brother the other; but take them by force, de∣vouring their Flesh, the Blood yet reeking hot between their Teeth. Lastly, Whosoever dies, be the Disease never so contagious, yet they eat the Flesh im∣mediately, as a Festival Dish.</P>
<P>The Habit of the common sort of Men differs not much from what before described;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apparel.</NOTE> for they go with the upper part of their Bodies naked, and with∣out any thing on their heads: but People of Quality have Clothes of Silk or Cloth, and on their Heads red or black Caps, of their own making, or else <HI>Portuguese</HI> Flannel Bonnets.</P>
<P>The Noble and other Women of Quality, cover themselves from Head to Foot with Mantles; but the common Women wear only a Cloth hanging down, girt about their Middle, and without Shooes.</P>
<P>The Men may keep as many Wives and Concubines as they please;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> but the Teeming Women after their Delivery, take no care to breed up their Children, but kill them and eat them up immediately.</P>
<P>They have neither Houses, Goods, Towns, or settled Dwelling-places; but rove like the wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> or barbarous <HI>Scythians,</HI> from place to place, neither Sowing nor Mowing, but living wholly by Rapine and Pillage, eating the Fruits of other Mens Labors, where-ever they come, devouring and spoiling all before them.</P>
<P>Their Language differs wholly from the <HI>Congish,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> which they endeavor to learn and become very expert in, though they make little use thereof, in regard of their Savage and unconversible Natures.</P>
<P>In stead of Money,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Money.</NOTE> they use <HI>Simbos;</HI> or little Horns, as those of <HI>Lovando,</HI> with whom they drive a great Trade, carrying thither Slaves and Ivory, which they exchange for these Horns, Salt, Silk, Glass-Dishes, and such like.</P>
<PB N="519" REF="325"/>
<P>Their Arms (for they love War) are short Wooden Bowes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> cover'd with divers colour'd Snake-skins, that they seem to be made of one piece; which they do to strengthen, and that they may hold it the faster in their Hands. They make these Weapons of a kind of tough black Canes, which prove very lasting and serviceable. The Arrows are short, light, and thin, made of hard Wood, which they commonly hold together with the Bowe in their Hands: In the use whereof, for Shooting, they have so great dexterity, that they can discharge eight and twenty Arrows before the first falls to the Ground, and can kill a Bird flying. Besides these, they use also a sort of Pole-axes, whose Handle having a Knob at the end, is cover'd with Snakes-skins: The Head shines very bright, being fastned in the Wood with Copper Pins, and like those in use sometimes among us, hath at one end a sharp Edge like a Hatchet, and at the other a Hammer. In Fighting, they defend themselves from the Enemies Arrows with the flat Sides thereof, in stead of a Shield, and turn every way with such readiness, that they void all the Shafts aimed at them.</P>
<P>They wear also Ponyards in Scabbards of Serpents-skins, in Belts of Ele∣phants-hides, three Fingers broad, and two thick. Some have Shields made of Wood, cover'd with the Skin of the Beast <HI>Dant.</HI></P>
<P>They worship the Sun, as their chief Deity, in the Shape of a Man;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> next to that the Moon, in the Figure of a Woman: But besides these, every one hath his peculiar Idol. When they go to Battel, they sacrifice to their Idol, out of which their Devil speaks very plain, and tells them what they must do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Anzikos</HI> live under a peculiar King, call'd the Great <HI>Makoko,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> whom they report to possess thirteen Kingdoms, making him one of the most Puissant in <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jages</HI> have three Governors; the first entitul'd <HI>Singe,</HI> the second <HI>Kobak,</HI> and the third <HI>Kabango,</HI> of which every one leads a distinct Army. They main∣tain continual Wars against other <HI>Blacks,</HI> and eat, as is before-mention'd, all the Slain, but sell the Prisoners; and in defect of Buyers, kill and eat them also. Such as desire to List themselves in their Companies, must first receive the usual Marks, <HI>viz.</HI> knock out the two upper and the two lower Teeth be∣fore, and make a hole through the middle of their Noses, into which they thrust Feathers.</P>
<P>There are at present no <HI>Jages</HI> to be found of the first Race; but those that now assume that Name, derive their Extract out of the several Countreys wherein they have Warred, and been Victorious, being chosen thereto in this manner.</P>
<P>So soon as they have won a Battel,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jages</HI> how they are bred.</NOTE> they search among the Prisoners for the handsomest Youths, of whose Courage they make tryal, by shooting at them, by, and over their Heads: Wherein if any discover a fear of the Arrows, as Cowards, and unfit for Service, they knock on the Head, and eat; but those that appear fearless and undaunted, they make holes through their Noses and Ears, knock out their Fore-teeth, and so bring them up to all Savage Cruelty; who by practice at last stray so far from Humanity, that they exceed the natu∣ral <HI>Jages.</HI> These possess not only this Countrey of <HI>Ansiko,</HI> but wander almost through all <HI>Africa;</HI> although now they have their chief Residence here, and in the South-East of <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>The Natural <HI>Jages,</HI> as the Ancientest People of <HI>Angola</HI> relate, are not the <HI>Indi∣gene</HI> of that Countrey; but came many years since, with an Army of an hun∣dred thousand, out of <HI>Serre-Lyons,</HI> and over-ran the whole Coast, beyond the

Others contra∣dict this, averring it improbable at least, that the <HI>Jagos</HI> should first come out of <HI>Serre-Lyons,</HI> and conquer as far as the Kingdom of <HI>Benguella,</HI> a Tract of above seven hundred Leagues, wherein they must pass so many Kingdoms, great Rivers, and Mountains.</P>

<P>The top of the Mountain <HI>Otreiro</HI> yields a curious prospect of all the adja∣cent Places, at great distance both to West and North, without any interpo∣sing stop to the Eye.</P>
<P>This Town hath neither Inclosure nor Wall, except a little on the South∣side, which the first King built, and afterwards gave that part to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to inhabit for their conveniency. Here also his Royal Palace shews it self, which he surrounded with Walls, in such manner, that between it and the Town remain'd a great Plain, in the middle whereof they have erected a beau∣tiful Church; besides these, Noble-mens Houses and others fill up the top of the Mountain: for every Grandee settles his Dwelling as near the Court as he may be permitted, and with his Retinue takes up as much Ground as an ordi∣nary Town may be builded on.</P>
<P>The common Houses stand in good order, and appear very uniform;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Court.</NOTE> most of them large, well contriv'd and fenced about, but generally Thatcht, except a few belonging to the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>The King's Palace is exceeding large, surrounded with four Walls,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> whereof that towards the <HI>Portuguese</HI> part consists of Chalk and Stone, but all the rest of Straw, very neatly wrought: the Lodgings, Dining-Rooms, Galleries, and other Apartments, are Hang'd after the <HI>European</HI> manner with Hangings of Mats, made with exquisite curiosity: within the innermost Fence are some Gar∣dens, plenteously stor'd with variety of Herbs, and Planted with several sorts of Trees: within these are some Banquetting-houses, whose Building, though mean and sleight, yet they esteem rich and costly.</P>
<P>The City boasts ten or eleven Churches, that is, one great one,

<P>There are also two Fountains, one in <HI>St. James Street,</HI>

<P>A small River, or rather a Branch of <HI>Lelunde,</HI> call'd <HI>Vese,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Vese.</HI></NOTE> affording very good and well tasted Water, flows in the East at the Foot of the Mountain close by the City, to the great benefit of the Inhabitants; for from thence the Slaves, both Men and Women, fetch Water daily to serve the Town. The adjacent Fields by this River are made very pleasant and fruitful, and therefore the Ci∣tizens
<PB N="526" REF="333"/>have all their Gardens upon its Banks. What Cattel they have, are Pastur'd and kept for the most part in the City, as Hogs and Goats, a few Sheep, but no Cows, which lie in the Nights closed in with Fences joyning to their Houses.</P>
<P>Rivers which water this Kingdom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> descending from North to South, are first <HI>Rio de las Borrenas Roxas,</HI> that is, <HI>The River of red Sand;</HI> another, at whose Mouth lieth a Street call'd in <HI>Portuguese, Bacas de las Almadias,</HI> that is, <HI>The Gulf of Canoos.</HI></P>
<P>Here lie three Islands, the greatest and middlemost of them inhabited, and provided with a convenient Haven for small Barques; but the other without People, harbouring onely Beasts.</P>
<P>After these,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River Zair.</NOTE> Southwards you may see the great River of <HI>Zair,</HI> which, ac∣cording to <HI>Pigafet,</HI> derives its Head out of three Lakes; the first, by the same <HI>Pigafet</HI> and others, entituled <HI>Zambre;</HI> the second, <HI>Zair;</HI> and the third, a great Lake from whence the <HI>Nyle</HI> is supposed to draw his Original, as out of the second Rise; out of which the <HI>Lelunde</HI> and <HI>Coanze</HI> run: but <HI>Zambre</HI> is the princi∣pal Head that feeds the River <HI>Zair,</HI> being set as it were in the middle Point of <HI>Africa,</HI> and spreading it self with broad Streams into the North, whither, ac∣cording to common Opinion, it sends forth <HI>Nylus;</HI> to the East, the great River <HI>Cuama</HI> and <HI>Coavo;</HI> to the South, those of <HI>Zeila, Manice,</HI> or <HI>Manhessen;</HI> and lastly to the West, this of <HI>Zair;</HI> which dividing it self into several Branches, moisten and pinguifies the Western part of South-<HI>Africa, Congo, Angola, Monopotapo, Mata∣mam, Bagamadiri, Agasymba,</HI> and so to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> whereas the <HI>Nyle, Cuama, Coavo, Zeila, Manice,</HI> spread over the whole <HI>Abyssine</HI> Countreys, and all others on the Sea-Coast, from the Mouth of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> to the River <HI>Cuama;</HI> and therein the Kingdoms of <HI>Melinda, Barnacassus, Quilor, Mombaza, Mozimba, Mombara, Membaca, Mozambico,</HI> and other strange Lands.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Zair</HI> breaks forth with an opening above three Leagues in breadth, in the Elevation of five Degrees and forty Minutes, and with so great force and abundance of Water runs into the Sea, that the fresh Stream coming out West-North-west, and North-east and by North, makes an impression therein above twelve Leagues, and when you are out of sight of Land, yet the Water appears black, and full of heaps of Reeds, and other things, like little floating Islands, which the force of the Stream, pouring from high Cliffs, tears out of the Countrey and throws into the Ocean, so that the Sea-men, without a stiff Gale of Wind, can hardly Sail through it, to get into the Road within <HI>Padron,</HI> on the South-side of the River. This violent and precipitate descent carries the Stream against you fourteen or fifteen miles. It sends forth on both sides many Branches or Rivers, to the great convenience both of the Inha∣bitants and foreign Tradesmen, who thereby in Boats and <HI>Canoos</HI> pass from one Town to another. In the Towns seated on these out-stretched Arms, dwell People small of Stature, probably <HI>Pigmies.</HI></P>
<P>The Islands <HI>Bomma</HI> and <HI>Quintalla</HI> lie in the Mouth of this River,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Zair</HI> Le several Islands</NOTE> and others higher upwards, exceeding full of People, who rebelling against the King of <HI>Congo,</HI> set up peculiar Lords of their own.</P>
<P>That of <HI>Bomma</HI> has Mynes of Iron;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island of <HI>Bommo.</HI></NOTE> and though boasting many Inhabitants, yet shews few or no Houses, because of the Morassness of the Countrey, which for the most part lieth under Water; so that the <HI>Blacks</HI> with <HI>Canos</HI> go from Tree to Tree; among which they have raised some places, made of Leaves and Boughs, on which they reside and rest themselves, without any Coverture.</P>
<PB N="527" REF="333"/>
<P>These Islanders appear strong, yet well set, live very beastially,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Manners of the Islan∣ders.</NOTE> are great Sor∣cerers, speak <HI>ore tenus</HI> with the Devil; in doing of which at first they come to∣gether all on a heap, and afterwards one of them runs about with a Vizard on: this continues three days, which expir'd, they use another Ceremony, and then the Fiend speaks through the vizarded Man. They live in peaceable Times by bartering; in time of Wars they deal in nothing but Weapons, Arrows, Bowes, and <HI>Assagays,</HI> or Lances.</P>
<P>They have no Marriages or Betrothing,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> but from their Youth up go one to another, as their Affections or Lusts lead them, commixing meerly like Beasts, without any Solemnity; for they know Laws of no Chastity, but take as many Concubines as they please: nevertheless, the first, being the eldest, hath the command and supervising over all the rest.</P>
<P>In the Island <HI>Quuntalla</HI> is an Idol made of Money, which none dare approach,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Idol of Money in <HI>Quuntalla.</HI></NOTE> but the Servants or Minister appointed to attend, and take care to secure the Way to it from being discover'd, themselves being obliged as often as they go thither, to take a peculiar Path that no other may find.

<P>These Islanders also have particular Heads, and chief Officers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> chosen by most Voices.</P>
<P>Several other Rivers pay their tributary Waters to increase the swelling Current of <HI>Zair,</HI> the most eminent are <HI>Umbre, Brankare</HI> and <HI>Barbale.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Umbre,</HI> by <HI>Sanutus</HI> call'd <HI>Vambere,</HI> rises in the North, out of a Mountain in <HI>Negro-Land,</HI> and loseth it self on the East-side in the <HI>Zair.</HI></P>

<P>The River <HI>Barbele,</HI> so call'd by <HI>Linschot;</HI> or <HI>Verbele</HI> by <HI>Pigafet,</HI> springs out of the same Lake which the same Author makes the Head-Source of <HI>Nylus</HI> to flow from; after which it shooteth through the Lake <HI>Aquilumde,</HI> and visiting the City of <HI>Pango,</HI> it enlargeth the <HI>Zair</HI> with the addition of its Water.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Bengo.</HI></NOTE> by some taken for a Branch of <HI>Danda,</HI> with <HI>Quanza</HI> another, lying makes the Island <HI>Lovando:</HI> it affords good Sailing with Sloops, about fourteen miles upward, and in the Mouth sometimes seven or eight Foot Water, not∣withstanding the Flats of Sand. It comes a great distance out of the Coun∣trey, and so inundates in the time of Rain, <HI>viz. March, April,</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> that with the violence of its Stream it sometimes carrieth away much of the Earth on one side, which either joyns again on the other, or else driven into the Sea.</P>
<P>The Winter there bears almost an equal temper with our Summer,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Climate of Air.</NOTE> so that the People alter nothing of their Apparel, nor require the warmth of Fire at that Season of the Year; for the difference between Winter and Summer is scarely discernable, onely the Air, so long as it Rains, is a little Cooler; but the wet Season once past, the Heat is almost intolerable, especially two hours be∣fore and after Noon.</P>
<P>The Winter commences in mid-<HI>March,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Seasons of Rain.</NOTE> and the Summer in <HI>September:</HI> in the former the great Rains begin, and continue <HI>March, April, May, June, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> during which time they have scarce a clear day; the lesser Rain, in <HI>September</HI> and <HI>November.</HI> The Summer on the other side is exceeding hot and dry.</P>
<P>This Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Congo</HI> is watry.</NOTE> from the several Rivers, hath great store of Water; so that the Inhabitants are very curious in their choice of it: for they will not drink the usual, and every where to be had, but take care for the freshest and best, as appears by them of <HI>St. Salvadore,</HI> who make not use of such as the adjoyning
<PB N="529" REF="334"/>Plains afford them, but cause their Slaves to fetch other, more sound and heal∣thy (as they suppose) out of Fountains, a little lower on the North-side.</P>
<P>The Lands in the time of Rain, by the muddiness of the water,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of the Land.</NOTE> are made exceeding fruitful, and fit to bring forth all manner of things.</P>
<P>The Dukedom of <HI>Batta,</HI> and other lying round about, hath fat and fertile ground, affording all manner of Provision.</P>
<P>The Territory of <HI>Pembo,</HI> especially about <HI>Saint Salvadore,</HI> because of the fresh and serene Air, abounds with rich Pastures,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> and produceth many flourishing and thriving Trees.</P>
<P>Here grows a kind of Grain, by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Luko,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luko.</NOTE> not unlike our Rye, but smaller: this they Grind into Meal, by a Hand-Mill, and make Bread of it.</P>
<P>Abundance also of <HI>Mille,</HI> which the Natives call <HI>Mazza, Manputo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mille,</HI> or <HI>Mazza.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Portuguese</HI> Corn; as also <HI>Mais,</HI> or <HI>Turky</HI>-Wheat, wherewith they fat their Hogs; and Rice in such plenty, that it hardly bears any price.</P>
<P>Lemmons, Oranges, and Pome-Citron-Trees grow in every corner, bear∣ing fruit of a pleasant, yet brisk taste; also <HI>Bananasses,</HI> Dates, Coco-Nuts, and Palm-Trees; besides others producing <HI>Colas,</HI> which the Inhabitants chaw, as the <HI>Indians, Betel.</HI> The Trees call'd <HI>Ozeghes,</HI> yields Fruit like yellow Plums, de∣lightful in smell, and delicious in taste; and with the Branches make Fences, Pallizadoes, and Arbors, to shelter them from the scorching Beams of the Sun. Nor do they want Melons, Cucumbers, and Citrons, of an extraordinary big∣ness, and pleasant taste.</P>
<P>The Shore of the River <HI>Lelunde,</HI> going to <HI>Saint Salvadore,</HI> stands beautifi'd with abundance of Cedars, which the ignorance of the people make no other ac∣count of them, than to make <HI>Canoos,</HI> and Fuel.</P>
<P><HI>Cassia Fistula</HI> and other Drugs, fit for the use of Apothecaries; as <HI>Tama∣rinds</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> grow plentifully, and have the repute of a good remedy in Feavers.</P>
<P>In the Towns near the Sea, they have store of Beans, <HI>Mille,</HI> and Poultrey, which the <HI>English, Netherlanders,</HI> and other Traders, buy with <HI>Panos, Simbos,</HI> little Looking-Glasses, and other Trifles.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bamba,</HI> a Province of <HI>Congo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> and there especially they have good stocks of Cattel, <HI>viz.</HI> Cows, Oxen, Swine, and Goats: Besides plenty of Fowl, as Tur∣kies, Hens, Ducks and Geese.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elephants.</NOTE> The Elephants breeding here in numerous droves, grow to an extraordinary bigness; insomuch, that some of their Teeth have weigh'd above two hundred weight: in <HI>Congoish</HI> Language, such a Tooth they call <HI>Mene-Manzo,</HI> and a young Elephant, <HI>Moane-Manzo.</HI></P>
<P>The Elephant (if the <HI>Blacks</HI> report true) casteth not his Teeth, having in∣deed but onely two. But they Hunt and Shoot them with Lances and Darts, making from them a double advantage, both of Merchandize and Victuals. There are many scurfed or hollow Teeth found in the Wilderness, which by lying many years in rain and wind become so. This Commodity, from the in∣finite abundance brought thence, within these fifty or sixty years, begins to abate much, because they are compell'd to fetch them further out of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The Elephant being struck with a Lance or <HI>Assagay,</HI> will use all means to assault and kill the person that wounded him; but as if teaching humanity to the beastial <HI>Blacks,</HI> neither eats the body nor insults over it, but making a hole with his Teeth in the ground, puts the dead body thereinto, and covers the

</FIGURE> place again with earth and boughs of Trees: therefore such as go to hunt af∣ter a wound given, hide themselves at first, and afterwards following afar off, till loss of blood bringing faintness, they dare approach nearer, and add more fatal wounds, to accelerate his death: For these <HI>Blacks</HI> have no knowledge how to take the Elephant alive, as they in the <HI>East-Indies:</HI> Some of these beasts have in their head a sort of Bezar-stone of a purple colour, which divers have sup∣pos'd to have a Medicinal quality.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buffle,</HI> in the language of the Countrey, call'd <HI>Empakasse,</HI> hath a red Skin, and black Horns, of which the Inhabitants make musical Instruments. It is a mischievous beast, and dangerous to be hunted, especially after they are shot, if not right struck; wherefore the Huntsmen, who mean to shoot a <HI>Buffle,</HI> first choose out a secure place, where they may not fear the furious assaults of the enrag'd Creature. They say, that if a Cow happen to eat where a <HI>Buffle</HI> Pastures, it will instantly die; for that the breath of the <HI>Buffle</HI> proves mortal poyson to other Cattel: The flesh of it is very gross and slimy, yet the Slaves eat freely of it, cut in slices and dry'd.</P>
<P>Here breeds in the Woods another Creature,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Azebro.</NOTE> seldom to be found elsewhere; they stile it <HI>Zebro,</HI> or <HI>Zebra,</HI> in shape like a Mule, with a Skin strip'd, on the head, and over the whole body, with colours of white, black, and blewish. They are very wild and swift, hard to be taken alive, and if taken, more dif∣ficult to be tam'd, though the <HI>Portuguese</HI> say, that some years since they sent four of these <HI>Azebras</HI> to <HI>Portugal,</HI> for a Present to the King, who us'd them for a Caroch, and rewarded the person who brought them over, with the No∣taryship of <HI>Angola,</HI> to him and his Heirs.</P>
<P><HI>Empalanga,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Empalanga.</NOTE> is a great Beast like an Ox, having two Horns, and very savoury; they are of several colours, some brown, others red, and some white.</P>
<P><HI>Envoeri,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Envoeri.</NOTE> also a great Beast like a Stag, with two Horns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Makoko,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makoko.</NOTE> differs little from a Horse in bigness, but hath long and slender Legs, a long and gray Neck, with many white small stripes, and upon his
<PB N="531" REF="335"/>head long sharp Horns, wreath'd below: the Dung of this Creature resembles that of a Sheep.</P>
<P>Tygers, in the <HI>Congoish</HI> language call'd <HI>Engri,</HI> never hurt the <HI>Whites;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Engri,</HI> or Tygers.</NOTE> so that when he meets a <HI>White</HI> and a <HI>Black</HI> together, he will assail the <HI>Black,</HI> and let the <HI>White</HI> pass unmedled with; therefore the King of <HI>Congo</HI> hath appointed a re∣ward for those, that can make appear by bringing of a Tygers Skin, that he hath kill'd one; with this proviso, that the hair of the Lips remain upon it, be∣cause they account them a venomous and mortal poyson.</P>
<P>The Leopards generally prey upon Cattel, so do the Lions, but they are not so cruel as the Tygers, nor so much dreaded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quumbengo,</HI> or Wolves, here very numerous, have a thick head and neck, almost like the Wolfs in <HI>Europe,</HI> but much bigger, gray headed, speckl'd with black spots like the Tyger, but much more ill-favour'd: Foxes, Stags, Deer, Conies, and Hares, swarm in incredible multitudes, because they are never hunted as here with us.</P>
<P>Civet-Cats, the <HI>Blacks</HI> catch and make tame, for their perfume.</P>
<P>The Territory of <HI>Batta</HI> affords many Beavers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beavers.</NOTE> whose Skins are of great va∣lue, one of them being as dear as a Sheep; so that none is suffer'd to wear them without the King's Licence.</P>
<P>Moreover, Apes and wild Cats grow troublesome by their numbers, especi∣ally in <HI>Songo,</HI> by the River of <HI>Zaire.</HI></P>
<P>Wild Boars, by them call'd <HI>Emgalo,</HI> may be seen here with two great Tusks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Emgola,</HI> or Wild-Boars.</NOTE> with which he tears violently; the <HI>Blacks</HI> stand more in fear of this, than any other Beast, and if they do but hear him, will make away with all speed possi∣ble. The filings of their Teeth (which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> highly esteem, and are very seldom gotten) taken in some Liquor, are reputed for a powerful Medi∣cine against Poyson; and Teeth themselves rubb'd against a stone, and admi∣nistred in a little Water, proves an infallible Cure against an Ague. They say, this Beast finding himself sick, regains his health by such rubbing of his Teeth upon a stone, and likewise with his Tongue.</P>
<P>Roebucks, call'd <HI>Golungo,</HI> breed here abundantly, but no bigger than Sheep,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rocbucks.</NOTE> of a brown colour, with some white specks, and two sharp little Horns: seve∣ral of the <HI>Blacks</HI> kill and eat them, but the <HI>Congoians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are by those of <HI>Con∣go</HI> and <HI>Ambonde,</HI> a forbid∣den food.</NOTE> and <HI>Ambondes</HI> will by no means taste their flesh; nay they bear such an antipithy to it, that they will not touch any thing out of that Pot, where their flesh hath been boyl'd, nor come into the place where the fire was that dress'd it, nor lay their hands on ought wherewith it was slain: But of this niceness can give no other rea∣son, but that the flesh is their <HI>Quistilla,</HI> that is, a food prohibited to them by Authority, and antient Custom, by Traditions deliver'd from hand to hand by their Fore-fathers; for they firmly and undoubtedly believe, that if they should do the contrary, they should not onely be lame in their bodies, but their fingers and toes would rot off.</P>
<P>Lastly, Bears, Foxes, and poysonous Serpents, frequent the Woods, and infinitely damage the people.</P>
<P>Besides these varieties of <HI>Quadrupeds,</HI> they shew many sorts of Wing'd Ani∣mals; as</P>
<P>First Peacocks, which none but the King onely may have,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peacocks.</NOTE> and he keeps them with great care in inclos'd Woods, upon the borders of <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>Of Partridges they have two sorts, tame and wild; as also Pheasants, Pi∣geons, Turtle-Doves; Eagles, Falcons, Merlins, Sparrow-Hawks, Pellicans,
<PB N="532" REF="336"/>green and red Parakitoes, Cranes, Storks, with red Bills and red Legs, and half white and half black Feathers.</P>
<P>There are also Owls, which they call <HI>Carjampemba,</HI> that is, <HI>Devils,</HI> because their appearing presages ill luck.</P>
<P>This Region produces two sorts of Bees;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bees.</NOTE> one that Hive in the Woods, in hollow Trees; and the other in the Roofs of Houses.</P>
<P>The Pismires,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pismires.</NOTE> by them styl'd <HI>Ingingie,</HI> are of four sorts; the biggest have sharp stings, with which they raise swellings upon men; the other three are somewhat smaller.</P>
<P><HI>Ensingie,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eusingie.</NOTE> is a little Beast, with a Skin speckled black and grey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Entiengio,</HI> a small Creature, very curiously streak'd, slender body'd, with a fine Tail and Legs, never comes upon the earth, for the very touch thereof proves mortal to it, therefore keeps in the Trees, and hath always twenty black Hair'd Creatures call'd <HI>Embis</HI> attending, that is, ten before it, and ten behind it. This they take in Snares, and when the ten first are taken, the ten behind be∣take themselves to flight; by which means the Animal bereav'd of its Life∣guard, at last is also taken.</P>
<P>The Skin of this little Beast bears such a value, that the King onely may wear it, unless perhaps by particular favour, some great Lords may be admitted; among which the Kings of <HI>Lovango, Cakongo,</HI> and <HI>Goy,</HI> are taken in.</P>
<P>Some have reported,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Congo</HI> are no Gold-Mines.</NOTE> that about <HI>Saint Salvadore</HI> there are Gold-Mines; but without any ground of probability, because the <HI>Portuguese</HI> are greedy of Gold, having convers'd so long in the Countrey, would not have left them un∣discover'd.</P>
<P>But they find many Copper-Mines in several places,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But of Copper.</NOTE> especially in <HI>Pembo,</HI> near the before-nam'd City, whose Mettal shews so deep a tincture of yellow, that reasonable Artists have mistaken for Gold; but upon proof, the errour becomes quickly rectifi'd.</P>
<P>The like Mines are found in <HI>Songo,</HI> yielding better Copper than that of <HI>Pem∣bo;</HI> whereof in <HI>Lovando</HI> the Purple Armlets are commonly made, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> carry to <HI>Calabare, Rio de Rey,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bamba,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Silver-Mines and other.</NOTE> saith <HI>Linschot,</HI> there are Mines of Silver, and other Mettals; and in <HI>Sundo,</HI> to the East-side, of Crystal, and Iron; the last bearing the highest value, because it makes Knives, Swords, and other Weapons.</P>
<P>Quarries of Stone they meet with frequently;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stones.</NOTE> as also Rocks of red Mar∣ble, besides many precious Gemms; as Jasper, Porphirie, Jacinth, and the like.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Congo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kind of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> known by the name of <HI>Macikongen,</HI> are very black; yet some few differ, being onely a kind of Olive-Colour: their Hair black, curl'd; their Bodies of a middle stature, and well Set; the whites of their Eyes of a Sea-green, and their Lips not so thick as other <HI>Blacks;</HI> wherein those of <HI>Congo</HI> differ from the other <HI>Blacks,</HI> especially from those of <HI>Nubia</HI> and <HI>Guinee.</HI></P>
<P>Although some of them be surly and proud,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their condition.</NOTE> yet in general they carry them∣selves very friendly towards strangers, being of a mild conversation, courte∣ous, affable, and easie to be overcome with reason; yet inclin'd to drink, espe∣cially <HI>Spanish</HI>-Wine and Brandy: Such as converse much with them, discern a quickness of reason and understanding, ordering their conceits and discourses so rationally, that the most knowing Persons take great delight in their facetious humor.</P>

<P>In the Wars they shew little Courage, for the most part going by the lose, if the <HI>Portuguese</HI> give them no assistance; for twenty <HI>Whites</HI> will put to flight a thou∣sand <HI>Congoians.</HI></P>
<P>These of <HI>Sango,</HI> are a proud, lazy, and luxurious people; but have a winning behavior and volubility of speech, beyond those that dwell on the Northside of the River <HI>Zaire.</HI></P>
<P>These of <HI>Bamba</HI> have the repute of the most Warlike and strongest of all in these parts, for they are such men, that can cut a Slave in two in the midst, with a Sword; or strike off the head of an Ox at a blow: And which is more, seem∣ing incredible, that one of their strongest men can with one Arm, hold up a vessel of Wine, which weighs three hundred and five and twenty pound weight, till the Wine be drawn out at the Spigget.</P>
<P>They have all a native propensity to Stealing; and what they so get,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are inclin'd to steal∣ing.</NOTE> they drink out instantly with their best Companions in Wine; one of which goes before the maker of this Feast, and other Friends crying aloud, <HI>Behold the King of Congo!</HI> doing him that honour, for the good Chear and Courtesie receiv'd from him that day.</P>
<P>In the ways from the Cities <HI>Saint Salvadore,</HI> and <HI>Lovando Saint Paulo,</HI> many discarded Noblemen, fall'n into disfavor with the King, keep in great Troops and Companies, Robbing and Plundering all Travellers, till restor'd again into the Princes Grace.</P>
<P>They much practice the villanous Art of Poysoning,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are given to poyson one another.</NOTE> whereby for the small∣est trifle, they execute a fatal revenge:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are severely pu∣nish'd.</NOTE> But those that use it had need have a care, for if the Author or Contriver be detected, he must die without mercy; which severity they abate nothing of at present: and for discovery, so strict inquiry is made, that it is very difficult to pass unknown; by which means this inhumane Custom begins to decay.</P>
<P>Eminent People, especially in Cities, go richly habited,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apparel.</NOTE> in great and long Mantles, of fine Cloth or black Bais; under which white Shirts appearing on the

<P>Those of <HI>Sango</HI> wear Coats from the Navel to the Ankles, and Mantles over the rest; but the Women cover their Breasts.</P>
<P>They play at Cards for Pastime,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Play.</NOTE> Staking little Horns or Shells, reckon'd among them as current Money.</P>
<P>The Citizens of <HI>Congo</HI> maintain themselves chiefly by Merchandize;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their maintainance.</NOTE> but the Countrey people, by Tilling of Land, and keeping of Cattel. Those about the River <HI>Zaire</HI> live by Fishing; others by drawing of <HI>Tombe</HI>-Wine; and some by Weaving.</P>
<P>When they travel from one place to another,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Congoians</HI> do not ride on horseback, but are carry∣ed by men.</NOTE> they ride not, but are carry'd by men in Hammacks, as the foregoing Plate sets forth; or else sitting upon a kind of Biers, made fast with a Cord to a Pole, upon the shoulders of their Slaves, or by hir'd people; with an <HI>Umbrella</HI> overhead, to prevent the scorch∣ing of the Sun: wherefore those that will go speedily, take with them many Slaves for their Journey, that when the first grow weary, he may be carry'd by the other.</P>
<P>They Marry and Betroth in <HI>Congo</HI> after the manner of the Christians; but will not be circumscrib'd thereby from keeping every one as many Concu∣bines, as they can provide Clothes and Expences for.</P>
<P>When the young Maids in <HI>Congo</HI> dispose themselves for a double Estate, they go into a dark house, and Paint themselves red with Oyl and <HI>Takoel,</HI> Wood of <HI>Majumba,</HI> staying therein about a moneth; and then chooseth out her eldest Free-man, that hath been most diligent and serviceable to her, and takes him to Husband.</P>

<P>When any Man or Woman among them dies, they blame the Survivor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of the death of Man or Woman is laid upon the Survivor.</NOTE> firmly believing such Persons cannot die by being called: to explain which, we must tell you, That they conceit, that none die either by Poyson, Violence, or otherwise, until their Friends in the other World call them; whereupon the Relations of the Deceased take away all things from the Survivor, and for eight Days afflict him with divers Pains and Torments, as shaving his Skin, and the like, saying, <HI>Thus must you bear the Punishment, if guilty, or having a hand in the Death of our Friends.</HI> The eight days ended, they bring him or her to a new Tryal, by Pleading; and if upon that quitted, they dwell still in the House, as before; but if found guilty, are banish'd thence.</P>
<P>There is a prevailing Custom among them, That if there be three Brothers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inheritance.</NOTE> and one of them die, the two that survive, share his Concubines between them: And when either of the two remaining die, the longest Liver takes all: Af∣ter whose Decease, all the Concubines stay in the House, and become his due that happens to dwell therein afterwards.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Accompt of their Year.</NOTE> which there begin upon the fifteenth of <HI>May,</HI> and end the fifteenth of <HI>November;</HI> The Months by the Full Moon, and the Days of the Week by their Markets; be∣cause they have every Day one in a several Place; but know not how to par∣cel out Time into Hours, or less Spaces.</P>
<P>These People, before the Arrival of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who instructed them in the Christian Faith, had no particular or proper Appellations; for the Com∣mon People call'd themselves by the Names of Herbs, Plants, Stones, Fowls, Beasts, and Living Creatures. The Lords bare the Title of the Lordship they commanded, as the Lord of <HI>Songo</HI> was call'd <HI>Mani-Songo,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Lord of Songo; Mani</HI> signifying <HI>Lord,</HI> and <HI>Songo</HI> the Countrey. But at this day, both Men and Women, Persons high and low, even the King himself, commonly re∣ceives a Name in Baptism.</P>
<P>They seem well experienc'd in several Handicrafts, but yet will not take upon them any Works of hard Labor.</P>
<P><HI>Congo, Songo,</HI> and <HI>Bamba,</HI> vent few Slaves, and those the meanest of all; be∣cause being us'd to live idly, when they are brought to Labor they quickly die.

<P>The <HI>Europeans</HI> also drive a little Trade with <HI>Simboes:</HI> But the chief Dealing in <HI>Songo,</HI> consists in <HI>Pannos Sambos,</HI> Oyl of Palm, <HI>Palmito</HI>-Nuts, and such like.

<P>The City <HI>Saint Salvadore</HI> is the Staple for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants in those Countreys, of whom the Natives desire chiefly to buy Cypress Clothes, or painted Table-clothes, call'd <HI>Capes de Verdura,</HI> blue Cans, <HI>Biramks,</HI> or <HI>Surats,</HI> Copper Basons, <HI>English</HI> Cloth, great <HI>Simbas</HI> of <HI>Lovando, Baesier,</HI> and other incon∣siderable Trifles, as Rings, Beads, and such like.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Housholdstuff.</NOTE> nor have any Housholdstuff, save onely Swords, Shields, and a few Slaves.</P>
<P>Their Wealth consists chiefly in Elephants-Teeth and <HI>Simbos,</HI> or little Shells,

<P>They have no Coyn'd Money,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Simboes</HI> or Horn Shells are their Money.</NOTE> either of Gold, Silver, or Copper; but, as we have often mention'd, make all their Markets with little Shells, call'd <HI>Sim∣boes,</HI> which pass here as Current, but in other Countreys of no esteem or va∣lue: And the <HI>Portuguese</HI> use them in their Passage, when they or their <HI>Pombe∣roes,</HI> that is Slaves, are sent with Merchandise to <HI>Pombo,</HI> and other Places lying up the Countrey, out of <HI>Angola, Lovando, Sante Paulo,</HI> through <HI>Congo.</HI></P>
<P>Apothecaries or Doctors they have none,

<P>The Pox, or Venerial Distemper call'd <HI>Chirangas,</HI> rages among them ex∣tremely, which they cure with red Wood call'd <HI>Tavilla.</HI></P>
<P>The King appoints a Judge in every particular Province,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> to hear and deter∣mine Civil Causes, and Differences that happen; who, though there be no settled Laws or Statutes, may Imprison and Release, or impose a Pecuniary Mulct or Fine upon them.

<P>In Matters of State,

The whole Strength of their Battel consists in the Infan∣try or Foot-Souldiers; for they have very few or no Horse.</P>
<P>In the Onset and Retreat they use little Discipline or Order;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confused disorder in fight∣ing.</NOTE> but upon the Word of Command, the Drums beating, and Horns blowing, they march for∣ward far distant from one another, and in that Motion give the first Charge with a Flight of Arrows, which done, they very dexterously wheel about, and leap from one place to another, to avoid the Enemies Arrows. In the Van commonly some sturdy Youths draw out, who with the ringing of Bells that hang at their Girdles, incourage and animate the other. After the first have fought till they be weary, upon the sound of one of their Horns, directed by the Commander in Chief, they Retreat, and others instantly supply their Places; and this continues so long, till one of the Armies proves Victorious.</P>
<P>If it chance that the General of the Army be kill'd, they instantly betake themselves to Flight, and leave the Field, no Force or Authority being able to make them Rally.</P>
<P>In going out to War, they take little care to be furnished with Provision; so that many times when they come into a Countrey with their Army, they are forced for very hunger to leave the Enemy, though half Conquer'd, and Retreat into their own Countrey. But now at length they begin to take notice of these Miscarriages, and by the Instructions of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> to alter and amend their evil Discipline.</P>

<PB N="538" REF="339"/>they shew themselves openly before the People, they appear very Stately, sit∣ting upon great Velvet Chairs, with Velvet Cushions, and spreading upon the Ground before them costly Tapestries; and this also the <HI>Portuguese</HI> taught them, to strike an awful Reverence into their Subjects, of their <HI>Grandezza.</HI></P>
<P>The Titles that the King uses to manifest his Greatness,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Titles.</NOTE> are these: <HI>Mani-Congo, by the Grace of God, King of Congo, Angola, Makamba, Okanga, Cumba, Lulla, Zouza; Lord of the Dukedoms of Batta, Sunda, Bamba, Amboille, and the Territories thereof; Lord of the Earldoms of Songo, Angoy, Cacongo, and of the Monarchy of Ambon∣des; Ruler of the great and wonderful River of Zaire.</HI></P>
<P>He rules with absolute Power and Sovereignty over his Subjects,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Dominion.</NOTE> who never approach near him, but with the most humble Postures of Reverence; and whoever fails to tender their due Respects and Obedience, he punishes with Perpetual Slavery.</P>
<P>But the Pomp of his Majesty and Greatness he shews especially when he Treats his Nobility,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Feeding of the Nobi∣lity, glorious.</NOTE> that are serviceable to him. This himself in Person deals out in the following manner.</P>
<P>At Noon the King causeth all the Noble-men, then in the Bounds of the Palace, to be numbred: Whereupon all the Pots are brought before them, one with boyl'd Beans, another with Flesh, and a third with <HI>Mille,</HI> without any Spicery but Salt, and some Oyl of Palm. To the greatest Lords he sends every one his Part, in a Wooden Platter, together with a small Flask of Palm-Wine: But those of less Quality are by Name call'd up, and Accommodated by six, seven, or eight together, to whom the King directs such a great Pot of <HI>Mille,</HI> Beans, or Flesh, according to their Number.</P>
<P>After the Feast is ended, they come all into the King's Presence, and falling upon their Knees, clap their Hands, and bow their Heads, in token of Thanks and Submission, and so depart to their own Homes; onely some Favorites stay all the day long, and drink so much Tobacco and Wine of Palm, that every one, as well the King as Nobles, are so highly fluster'd, that they cannot go from the Place.</P>
<P>When the King goes abroad,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">With what State he goes abroad.</NOTE> not only the Nobility, but also those that dwell about the Court, or by occasion are found there at that time, attend him; some going before, others following; but all dancing and tumbling with an∣tick Postures, to the Musick of certain ill-tun'd Drums, and long Ivory Flutes like Cornets, until the King be within his House.</P>
<P>At the King's going to Church, presently, as soon as he is come without the Palace, not onely his own Grandees, which at all times are ready, but also the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> as well Temporality as Clergy, must wait upon him, and again from the Church to his Palace; but at no other time are the <HI>Portuguese</HI> oblig'd to such Attendance.</P>
<P>When he sheweth himself openly to the People, he is always attired in his richest Robes, that is, a great long Mantle or Cloak, of Silk, Velvet, or fine Cloth, most splendidly beautifi'd: On his Fingers he hath some Gold Chains, intermixt with fine Coral; and upon his Head, a bordered and preciously adorned Cap.</P>
<P>He hath in his Palace about a hundred Waiters, who all have Lodgings in the Court. He eats his Meat after the manner of <HI>Europe,</HI> at a high Table, where he always sits alone, with some few Pieces of Plate for his use. All his Waiters go cloathed in black Mantles of Bais.</P>
<P>The Chair upon which he sits hath Covers of red or green Velvet, fastned

<P>When the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred forty two,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders</HI> sent to the King in Embassy.</NOTE> came the first time to the King, as Ambassadors from <HI>Lovando Sante Paulo,</HI> immediately after they had forced it from the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> they got Audience at the Evening, in the Dark, passing through a Gallery two hundred Paces long, set on both sides with two Ranks of Men, with Wax Candles in their Hands burning.</P>
<P>The King sate in a small Chappel, hang'd with Rush Mats,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the King.</NOTE> from the top of which a Branch hung with Wax Candles; Habited in a Cloth of Gold Coat and Drawers, and about his neck three heavy Gold Chains: He had on his right Thumb a very large Granate or Ruby Ring, and on his left Hand two great Emeraulds; upon the left Sleeve of his Coat, a Gold Cross was fastned, richly enclos'd in a piece of well-polish'd Crystal: On his Head a fine white Cap, and on his Legs a pair of Russet Boots. At his right side stood an Officer, that sometime gently fanned the Air with a Handkerchief; and at his left side another, holding a Tin Bowe, and a Tin Scepter, cover'd with fine strip'd Cloth in his Hand. His Seat a red Velvet <HI>Spanish</HI> Chair, aloft above which, upon a Border, was embroider'd in Letters, <HI>Don Alvarez King of Congo.</HI> Right before him lay spread a great <HI>Turkey</HI> Carpet, and over his Head hung a Canopy of white Sattin, set with Gold, and trimm'd about with a deep Fringe. A little on the right side kneeled before him <HI>Don Bernardo de Menzos,</HI> his Interpreter and Secretary.</P>
<P>The King's Apparel is very glorious and rich,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cloathing.</NOTE> being for the most part Cloth of Gold or Silver, with a long Velvet Mantle.</P>
<P>This King wears commonly a white Cap upon his Head;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He wears a white Cap.</NOTE> so do his <HI>Fidal∣goes,</HI> or Nobility, in his Favour: And this is indeed so eminent a token thereof, that if the King be displeased with any of them, he onely causes his Cap to be taken off from his Head: For this white Cap is a Cognizance of Nobility or Knighthood here, as in <HI>Europe</HI> every Order hath a peculiar Badge to distinguish it.</P>
<PB N="540" REF="340"/>
<P>When the King goeth abroad with all his Nobles adorn'd with white Caps on their Heads,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">When the King is desirous to have Taxes, he lets his Cop blow off.</NOTE> he sometimes puts on a Hat, and at pleasure lays that aside, and resumes his Cap, which he then puts very loosely on, upon set purpose that the Wind should blow it off the easier; which according to design hap∣ning, his <HI>Fidalgoes</HI> run to take it up, and bring it to the King again: but the King as offended at the Disgrace, will not receive the same, but goeth home very much troubled; the next day he sends two or three hundred <HI>Blacks</HI> abroad to gather in Taxes; so punishing his whole Kingdom, for the offence of the Wind in blowing off his Cap, which he caused of set purpose.</P>
<P>He hath one Married Wife,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen is call'd <HI>Ma∣ni-mombada.</HI></NOTE> which they call <HI>Mani-Mombada,</HI> that is <HI>Queen;</HI> all the rest,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Taxes for the Queen, how rais'd.</NOTE> being no small number, are Concubines. For this Wife a Yearly Tax is gathered through the whole Kingdom, by them call'd <HI>Pintelso;</HI> every House paying a Rate for their Beds, <HI>viz.</HI> a Slave for every Spans breadth: so that if it be three Spans broad, they pay three Slaves.</P>
<P>The Queen hath her Lodgings in the Palace,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her place of aboad.</NOTE> apart, with her Ladies of Ho∣nor, which have little Courtship or Art to set them forth; yet they go almost every night abroad to take their pleasure, and to satisfie their wanton desires; onely some stay according to their turns to wait upon the Queen, who will her self, if she finds a convenient opportunity, and a Person that dares venture to come in the Night over the Straw Walls into the Court, to her private Lodg∣ings, not be backward to receive their proffer'd Kindness: But this she doth with great circumspection; for if the King should hear of it, it would endan∣ger both their Lives.</P>
<P>The King, on the contrary, keeps as many Concubines as he pleases; as well of the Ladies of Honor belonging to the Queen, as of others, without check: but the Priests spare not to reprove him for it openly in their Preach∣ing.</P>
<P>When the King dies, his Relations put him into the Grave in a Sitting Po∣sture, to whom formerly a dozen young Maids leap'd out of free choice, and were buried alive, to serve him in the other Life, as believing, That he should not remain dead, but go into that other World, and live there. These Maids were then so earnest and desirous of this Service to their deceased Prince, that for eagerness to be first, they kill'd one another. And their Parents and Friends gather together all sorts of stately Clothes, and put them into the Grave, to the intent that when they arrive in that strange Countrey, they may buy such things as they have occasion for therewith.</P>
<P>The Funeral of the King, in stead of other Mourning, is celebrated eight days together with continual Eating and Drinking; and this kind of Mourn∣ing they call <HI>Malala,</HI> and every Year after Solemnize it with an Anniversary-Meeting in the same manner.</P>
<P>This Custom is not only us'd for the King, but also for the Nobility, ac∣cording to their Quality, and continues to this day; but by the progress of Christianity, teaching better things, they have laid aside totally the burying of People alive.</P>
<P>In the Succession to the Crown they observe no Order;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inheritance of the Crown</NOTE> neither Legitimati∣on nor Seniority taking place further than the Ruling Grandees please; they, according to the humor of barbarous Nations, esteeming all alike Honorable: For which reason the Nobles chuse one out of the King's Sons (whether Legi∣timate or Illegitimate it matters not) for whom they have the most respect, or think the fittest; or else perhaps sometimes sway'd by extravagant Fan∣cies,
<PB N="541" REF="340"/>relinquish all the Children, and give the Crown to a Brother or Nephew.</P>
<P>The Coronation of the King they Solemnize after this manner.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the King's Coronation.</NOTE> All the Nobles and <HI>Portuguese</HI> assemble before the Palace, in a four-square open Court, built for that purpose of old, encompass'd with a slight Stone Wall about five Yards high; in the middle of which stands a great Velvet Chair and a Cushion, with a stately Carpet spread before it, and a Crown wrought of Gold, Silk and Silver-Wyre laid thereon; as also three Gold Armlets, about the thickness of a Finger, and a Velvet Purse, wherein is the Pope's Bull, or Letters of Confirmation to the new King.</P>
<P>The intended King after some time comes into this Congregation, by in∣vitation of the Nobless concern'd primarily in the Election; where all things prepared, there stands one up, which in the nature of a Herald proclaims these words:</P>
<P><Q>You that shall be King, be no Thief, neither covetous nor revengeful; but be a friend of the Poor: You shall bestow the Alms for the releasement of Prisoners or Slaves, and help the Needy, and be charitable to the Church, and always endeavour to keep this Kingdom in Peace and Quietness, and fully observe and keep the same without breach of League with your Brother the King of <HI>Portugal.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After this Speech ended, the Musick begins to play with excellent Melody; which having continued a convenient season, the last two <HI>Fidalgo's</HI> go seeming∣ly to seek him amongst the People, the remaining part of them sitting upon the Ground. These two in a short time find him they sought for, and bring∣ing him one by the right Arm, and the other by the left, place him upon the foremention'd Royal Chair, and put the Crown upon his Head, on his Arms the Gold Armlets, and the usual black Cloth, or Bayze-Cloak, upon his Body; then he lays his Hand upon a Mass-Book and the Evangelists, which the Priest holds to him, Clothed in a white Garment, hung with white Tassels, and the King swears to do and keep all that he hath been forewarned of, by him the formention'd Herald. After the ending of these Solemnities, the twelve Noble∣men and the King go to the Palace, accompanied with all those that were pre∣sent at the Coronation, who cast Earth and Sand upon him, for a Token of rejoycing, and for an Admonition, that though he be now King, he shall be Dust and Ashes.</P>
<P>The King after his Crowning remains eight days in his Palace, never going forth; in which time all the <HI>Black</HI> Nobility, none excepted, and all the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> come to visit and wish him good success: the <HI>Blacks</HI> do him a kind of Homage, lying down upon both Knees, clapping their hands, and kissing the King's Hand: the <HI>Portuguese</HI> sit kneeling upon one Knee, and so the Priests and Clergy, by that humble posture acknowledging his Soveraignty.</P>
<P>After the eight days past the King appears in the Market, and makes a Speech to the People, expressing his readiness for the performing of that which was propounded to him, with assurance to them, that he will seek nothing more than the quiet and welfare of his Kingdoms and Subjects, and the propa∣gating of the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Congo,</HI> take the Oath of Fidelity to their King, like other <HI>Christians,</HI> but forget it quickly, Murdering him upon any sleight occasion, ei∣ther by Insurrections or Treason; so that within these forty or fifty years they have had many Kings: for if all things go not to their minds, or if it Rains too much or too little, or if any other accident happens, the King bears the blame.</P>

<P>The Earl of <HI>Songo,</HI> the most Potent in all <HI>Congo,</HI> was subject to this King; but considering the Woods of <HI>Findemguolla,</HI> which surrounds his Countrey like a Bulwark, he fortifi'd it, and made it almost impregnable; so casting off the Yoke, he will not acknowledge the King of <HI>Congo</HI> for his Soveraign, but onely as a Friend of <HI>Songo.</HI></P>
<P>Formerly this Earl, before the taking of the City <HI>Lovando St. Paulo</HI> by the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred forty and three, by instigation of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> would have burnt their Ware-houses, but that he was afterwards prevented, and his anger aswaged.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Songo</HI> yields Copper,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is Copper in <HI>Sougo.</HI></NOTE> much better than that of <HI>Congo,</HI> and some Cotton, but they Vend little of it.</P>
<P>In the Year sixteen hundred thirty six,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wars between the King of <HI>Songo</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Souho.</HI></NOTE> the King of <HI>Congo, Don Alvares,</HI> the se∣cond of that Name, for some cause given by the foremention'd Earl, with a great Company of Men, and the assistance of a Company of eighty <HI>Portuguese</HI> Soldiers of <HI>Lovando St. Paulo,</HI> drew into the Field: But the <HI>Songo's,</HI> by a sudden Sallying out of the Wood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Overthrow of the King of <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> routed the King's Army, and took him Prisoner; so that for his release and restoration to his Kingdom, he was forced to give to the Earl two Territories, the one a Principality, call'd <HI>Mokata,</HI> a great Land of Tillage, lying where the River <HI>Zair</HI> bordereth nearest to <HI>Songo.</HI> Yet after∣wards the Quarrel was renew'd, and Forces on both sides drawn into the Field,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A second Overthrow.</NOTE> and the Controversie coming to be decided by the Sword, the King lost the Day, and together with it many Slaves. These two Victories exceedingly puffed up the Earl. It was imputed to the King as a great miscarriage, that this last he drew into the Field with a small Force, whereas he hath innumera∣ble People under his Command: but this oversight he quickly amended, and hath taken severe revenge of the <HI>Songo's</HI> for the Losses formerly received. But this kept them not long quiet,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new War.</NOTE> for the old Earl being dead, in the Year Sixteen hundred forty and one, there arose a new and bloody War between the King and the Earl <HI>Don Daniel du Silva,</HI> arising upon this ground: When after the
<PB N="543" REF="341"/>Decease of <HI>Don Michael,</HI> who Rul'd about the Year Sixteen hundred and six, his Son, the foremention'd <HI>Don Daniel du Silva,</HI> could not come to succeed, be∣cause a Faction rais'd against him was too strong, he fled to the Duke of <HI>Bamba;</HI> in whose Court he remain'd a long time: but at last, by the help of his Confe∣derates, got the possession of his Inheritance, and burning with revenge for his sufferings and disgrace, he gave occasion of Quarrel, by refusing to request of the King of <HI>Congo,</HI> according to the old Custom, the confirmation of his Possessi∣ons, first accusing him as one that had a hand in his long Expulsion, and there∣withall adding, that the Election of his Subjects did enough confirm him in his Government, and therefore he needed no other. The King of <HI>Congo</HI> enra∣ged hereat, and accounting it a great dis-reputation and diminution to his Royal Authority, to be so Bearded, as a manifestation of his high displeasure, placed his Son, the Prince <HI>Don Alphonso,</HI> in the Principality of <HI>Makata,</HI> former∣ly given, as we have said, to the Earl of <HI>Songo,</HI> for releasing of the King <HI>Don Alvarez,</HI> giving him in charge not onely to keep it, but from thence to make War upon the Earl. Hereupon Discontents daily growing on, the King of <HI>Congo</HI> raised a great Army, which he gave to <HI>Don Alphonso,</HI> who therewith invaded <HI>Son∣go,</HI> and using all the extremities of War both against his Countrey and Subjects: But the <HI>Songo's,</HI> a very Warlike People, in the Year Sixteen hundred forty and five, the nine and twentiteth of <HI>April,</HI> in a Pitch'd Battel, defeated and put to flight the King's Army, and took the fore-mention'd Prince of <HI>Mokata,</HI> toge∣ther with many Grandees, Prisoners, and according to the Custom of the Countrey, chopt off all their Heads; onely he kept <HI>Alphonso</HI> Prisoner, being his Cousin, and would not suffer him to depart from him.</P>
<P>The King by this overthrow provoked more than ever to take revenge, raised in the following Year so great a Force, that he doubted not therewith to over-run the whole Earldom at once: Of this Army, consisting of almost all the Nobility, together with three or four hundred <HI>Moulatto's,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bamba</HI> was made General, and therewith drew near to the Borders of <HI>Songo;</HI> but was unawares fall'n upon by an Ambuscade out of the Wood <HI>Emtinda Guola,</HI> on the last of <HI>July,</HI> and his Army not onely totally defeated,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A third Overthrow.</NOTE> but the Duke himself necessitated to yield to the Earl some Places and Countreys,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Bamba</HI> ta∣ken Prisoner.</NOTE> before wrested from him, for the release of Prince <HI>Alphonso</HI> his Son. Who was no sooner come, home in safety, but the <HI>Congo's,</HI> inclin'd to the old revenge, and not being able to digest the disgrace, began new Quarrels, which quickly broke forth into a great flame.</P>
<P>During this War the King sent Ambassadors with Letters to <HI>Brazile</HI> to <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassadors sent both from <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Songo</HI> to <HI>Brazile.</HI></NOTE> who had the Government of that Countrey for the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> together with many Slaves for a Present to the Council, and two hun∣dred more, with a Gold Chain, to <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> himself. Not long after their ar∣rival came thither also three Ambassadors from the Earl; one of which was Shipt from thence to <HI>Holland</HI> to the States; the two other required of <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI> that he would give no Assistance to the King of <HI>Congo;</HI> which in some manner he hearkned to, and to that end wrote Letters to their Governors in <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> not to intermeddle in the Wars of these two Princes, for that they were both in League with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassadors having been treated with all Civility,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents.</NOTE> and receiv'd their Dispatch, return'd with Letters and Gifts: to the King was sent a long scarlet Mantle, border'd with Gold and Silver Lace, a Silk Coat, and a Beaver Hat, with a Hat-band about it, wrought all over with Gold and Silver; and to the

<P>Afterwards the King and the Duke of <HI>Bamba</HI> the second time sent Ambassa∣dors to <HI>Grave Maurice,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Congo's</HI> Ambassa∣dors come into the <HI>Mether∣lands.</HI></NOTE> which he receiv'd and entertain'd sumptuously, desiring his favour, that they might go into the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> which being granted, and they arrived in <HI>Holland,</HI> they shew to that State, and to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> their Credentials from the King, and other Letters to the Governors of the <HI>West-India</HI> Company; to whom, among other things, they declared many Cu∣stoms of their Countrey, and in particular, how their Kings sits upon his Throne, causing his Greatness to appear by long silence; As also how the Inhabitants, after the manner of the Heathens, did worship and adore him.</P>
<P>Before the coming of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> into these Countreys,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Religion.</NOTE> and their con∣verting them to <HI>Christianity,</HI> the People of <HI>Congo</HI> had several sorts of Idols; for every one according to his pleasure, without any rule or reason, chose him∣self a god which seemed most for his advantage. Some worshipped Dragons, Serpents, Goats, Tygers, and many other living Creatures; others adored Fowls, Plants, Trees, yea, the very Skins of these Beasts stuffed with Straw. To these Idols they used several Ceremonies, which chiefly consisted in humi∣lity, as bending of Knees, laying their Faces on the Earth, and daubing them with Dirt, and sacrificing, or offering to them all their best and dearest things; but at last they were brought to light out of this Idolatry, in which they had for many Ages lay'n drown'd, by the endeavors of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> the manner and occasion whereof happen'd thus:</P>
<P>When <HI>Don John,</HI> the second of that Name, King of <HI>Portuguese,</HI> was bent up∣on the discovery of the East-Coast and Countrey of <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> in the Year Fourteen hundred and eighty four, he equipped a Fleet to that purpose under the Command of <HI>Johan Cano,</HI> who being come before the River <HI>Zair,</HI> sent Agents to the King of <HI>Congo;</HI> but they not returning, he took four
<PB N="545" REF="342"/><HI>Congo's</HI> that came to see the Ships, and after some time spent in Coasting re∣turn'd, carrying them with him, whom the King receiv'd with great courtesie, and immediately dispatched <HI>Cano</HI> back to <HI>Congo</HI> with great Presents; who being come upon the Coast, sent one of these four Natives to the King of <HI>Congo,</HI> en∣treating the return of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> whereto easily consenting, <HI>Cano</HI> sent home the three remaining <HI>Congo's.</HI></P>
<P>The fore-mention'd <HI>Portuguese,</HI> during the time of their stay and detention in <HI>Congo,</HI> became so intimately acquainted with the Duke of <HI>Songo,</HI> Unckle to the then King, and a Man of a noble spirit, that they instructed him in the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and demonstrated so plainly the errour of their Idolatrous Ways, that the Duke went himself to the King in Person to relate it to him, and advise with him about the change of their Religion; whereupon the King after many perswasions and arguments, at length condescended to send an Embassy to <HI>Portugal,</HI> requesting the King to send some Priests for their in∣struction; and accordingly <HI>Zakuten</HI> that had been there before, was sent with Instructions, Letters, and a noble Retinue, who arriving there, first learn'd the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue, and soon after he, with all that belong'd to him, received Baptism: This gave such encouragement to King <HI>John,</HI> that according to de∣sire he dispatcht away <HI>Zakuten,</HI> with some Priests, and all sorts of Church-Ornaments, where both Prince and People received them with inexpressible joy.</P>
<P>The first that publickly received Baptism was the Duke of <HI>Songo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Songo</HI> is Baptiz'd.</NOTE> with his Son, in the Year Fourteen hundred ninety one, himself being named <HI>Emanuel,</HI> and his Son, <HI>Anthony:</HI> afterwards the King himself follow'd the steps of the good Earl, taking the Name of <HI>John;</HI> the Queen, <HI>Eleanor;</HI> and his youngest Son, <HI>Alphonso.</HI> This good example prevailed with many, not of the Nobles onely, but of the Commonalty of all sorts, and each succeeding day increased their number; since which time the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have not spared any hazards, labour or pains, both to increase and confirm the new planted Religion, which hath been answered with a suitable success.</P>
<P>Amongst these are many Schoolmasters, who besides Reading and Writing, teach the Catechism, wherein they make their Scholars perfect; who in gene∣ral follow and obey the Commands and Canons of the Holy Catholick Church.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jages</HI> overcome the Kingdom of <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> ruining the same with Fire and Sword. The Province of <HI>Batta</HI> lay first in their way, where, on a certain Plain before the City of <HI>St. Salvadore,</HI> the King gave them Battel, but with the loss of many People, insomuch that he was forced to retreat into the City; from whence, not after driven, he fled for safety, together with many <HI>Portuguese</HI> and chief Lords of the Realm, to <HI>Ilhas das Cavallus,</HI> that is, <HI>Horse-Island,</HI> leaving the City to the <HI>Jages</HI> for a Prize, who burnt it, together with the Churches, laying waste the whole, and carrying away the Inhabitants, whom they kill'd and eat: The Husbandmen fled to the Woods and Wildernesses, chusing rather to die there of Hunger, than to fall into the hands of such inhumane Cannibals: Nor did that necessity onely follow the Woods, but the Famine spread over the inhabit∣ed Parts, so that for a little Meat a Slave was given, at that time worth at least ten Crowns; nay more, thousands sold themselves for Slaves to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> of the Island of <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> to preserve themselves from starving; amongst which were some of the Royal Blood, and many of the chief Lords.</P>
<P>The <HI>Congo's</HI> King finding himself too weak to withstand his Enemies, by the Counsel of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> sent an Agent to <HI>Don Sebastian,</HI> then King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> praying his Aid; who immediately sent him a Supply by Shipping of six hun∣dred Soldiers: In which Expedition many Nobles and Reformado's put them∣selves into the Service, under the Command of <HI>Don Francis de Govea,</HI> a Man who had often been in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> who after a fortunate Voyage arriving at <HI>St. Thomas Isle,</HI> where by Order they put in for Recruits of Ammunition, and to Victual and refresh, they went over to <HI>Congo,</HI> and Landed at <HI>Horse-Island,</HI> where the King of <HI>Congo</HI> then had his abode; where the General having received new Supplies of <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Congo's,</HI> went over to the Main Land, and Fought the <HI>Jages,</HI> beating them in divers Battels; insomuch that <HI>Alvarez,</HI> after a year and a halfs exile, was restor'd to his Realm.</P>
<P>The King being thus re-setled in his Throne, required for the establishing of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, that Priests might be sent thither; and as an acknow∣ledgment of this Aid and Assistance, he obliged himself by a Written Obliga∣tion, to send yearly a Present of Slaves, and withall to own him as his Lord: The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> refused the same, modestly returning, <HI>That he acknowledged the King of</HI> Congo <HI>for his Brother at Arms;</HI> but answer'd his Desire for establish∣ing the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion. At length after four years the General departed, onely leaving behind many <HI>Portuguese,</HI> as a Guard to secure the Peace of <HI>Congo</HI> for the future.

<P>This King hath the repute of greater puissance than he of <HI>Congo,</HI> as having ten other Kings Tributary to him.</P>
<P>This King keeps constantly, within appointed places in his Court, two hun∣dred Slaves; of which, part are given him yearly for Tribute, and part con∣demn'd persons; all fed by their keepers, like stall'd Oxen, or fatted Sheep and Hogs, being the store to supply the King and his Courtiers with choice Provision, for whose use slain, and their flesh serv'd up as a delicate Morsel; for they eat it rather out of a devilish wantonness, than necessity, for that al∣most all sorts of Cattel breed there in infinite multitudes; neither is the Land wanting of any other product fit for humane Food.</P>

<P>The <HI>Sovasen</HI> maintain the Boundaries so exactly, that never any Complaint is heard of one wronging or incroaching upon another, unless it be in open Wars; and then the Conquerer becomes wholly Master of his Enemies Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>This Territory can shew neither Artificial Forts, or Natural Fastnesses of Woods for a Defence against their Enemies; some little Groves may be seen upon Hills, but so inconsiderable, as hardly worth mentioning: Yet these Peo∣ple cannot easily be conquer'd, because they use such good Discipline, shoot∣ing their Arrows either lying upon the ground, or kneeling.</P>

<P>Here in some few Places the Inhabitants Till their Ground.</P>
<P>Two or three Miles in the Countrey, on the Hills, stands a Wood, enclosed
<PB N="554" REF="349"/>about with Bushes and Thorns, to the great accommodation and strengthen∣ing of the whole: For if the Inhabitants should retire thither, it were impos∣sible to force them out, save onely for want of Water, there being none but what the Rivers <HI>Quansa</HI> and <HI>Bengo</HI> bring thither.</P>
<P>Nine Miles Eastwards,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massingan.</NOTE> and above the Island of <HI>Motchiama,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Missingan,</HI> or <HI>Massagan,</HI> stands a small Town of the same Name (where the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have a Fort) erected between <HI>Quansa</HI> and <HI>Sunda,</HI> the last of which en∣virons it on the North, as the former on the South: And about the distance of two hours walk, intermingle their Streams, from which Conjunction the Town derives its Appellation, <HI>Massingan</HI> signifying <HI>A mixture of Waters.</HI> It was at first an open but pretty large Village, but since augmented with many fair Stone-Houses, whereby at length 'tis become a City. The first <HI>Portuguese</HI> Go∣vernor of <HI>Angola,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred seventy eight, by command of his Master erected this City of <HI>Lovando Saint Paulo,</HI> and also the Fort there, when by the help of the <HI>Congeses</HI> he warred against the King of <HI>Angola</HI> in the Coun∣trey: And now inhabited by many Families of <HI>Portuguese,</HI> besides <HI>Mulattoes</HI> and <HI>Blacks.</HI></P>

<P>The unwholsomness of the Air breeds divers Sicknesses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitution of the Air, and Sicknesses.</NOTE> especially violent and burning Fevers, which kill in few Hours, unless prevented by frequent Phlebotomy.</P>
<P>The Pox is so common among them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pox.</NOTE> that they think it no Disgrace; and for Remedy use Oyntments, and Physical Herbs taken inwardly; but through want of Skill, the Cure remaining imperfect, many die.</P>
<P>They have another frequent Distemper call'd <HI>Bitios de Kis,</HI> suprising them with Melancholy, great pain in the Head, Faintness and soreness of Limbs, and makes their Eyes stand out staring, as if they would fall out.</P>
<P>The Cure, which immediately must be used upon the appearance of the Symptomes, they perform by washing the Fundament very clean, and put∣ting a Pill made of a quarter of a rinded Lemmon therein, with the Finger holding it in as long as may well be endur'd; which is not done without great pain and burning, a sign of the right <HI>Bitios.</HI> This Medicine, though seeming but mean, yet proves the onely Remedy against this Disease, if time∣ly applied: But if the Distemper be grown inveterate, and far rooted (which the swelling out and opening of the end of the Gut, and a whitish loosness testifies) then a Mixture of Juyce of Tobacco-leaves, Salt, and Vinegar, steeped together two hours, then stamped in a Mortar, and so much thereof put into the Fundament as can well be done, and kept there as long as possi∣ble, reduces the Part again to its proper condition, and absolutely cures the Disease. But this Medicine is so painful, and hardly to be endured, that the sick Person must be fast held by two strong Men, else he can never receive the intended Advantage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bitios</HI> also are cured by frequent Clysters, or Serringing the Fundament-Guts with the purified Decoction of the Plant <HI>Orore de Bitos,</HI> and dried Rose∣leaves
<PB N="555" REF="349"/>mixt, with one or two Yelks of Eggs, and a little Allom, and Oyl of Roses. For the preventing hereof, so soon as the tokens of it are perceived, the Fundament must first be well cleansed; then a Medicine made of a new∣laid Egg, well beaten with a little Rose-water and Sugar, with which mix White Lead scraped small; then dipping fine Lint into it, put it up into the Fundament. Observe here, That White Lead is taken for a rare Cure against this Evil.</P>
<P>Another Disease sorely afflicts them, taking away in a manner their Sight, so that they grow Pur-blind; but by applying the raw Liver of a <HI>Hey,</HI> re∣gain their former Health. Few escape the misery of sore Legs, whose malig∣nity is such as will hardly admit Cure.</P>
<P>They labor under another sort of Distemper,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beriberi.</NOTE> which the <HI>Indians</HI> call <HI>Beri∣beri,</HI> being a Lameness of all the Limbs, and supposed to have its original from the ill curing of the <HI>Bitios,</HI> and not cleansing the Blood enough.</P>
<P>The best Medicine against this is, to anoint the Joynts before a Fire, with an Oyl by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Man-Tennah,</HI> which in the Island of <HI>Sumatra</HI> drops out of the Rocks, like Stone-oyl, and proves very wholesom and serviceable against all Colds, weakness of Limbs, and Strains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Boasi</HI> is a Malady very common and pernicious, rotting off the Nose,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boasi.</NOTE> Hands, Feet, Fingers, and Toes; spreading from Joynt to Joynt with great pain, until without Remedy it brings them to their End.</P>
<P><HI>Embasser,</HI> a usual Sickness, proceeds from the hardness of the Spleen,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Embasser.</NOTE> which makes them grow melancholy, yellow of colour, heavy-hearted, and faint: But Broath made of the Root of the Tree <HI>Embotta,</HI> that part especially that lies to the Morning-Sun, restores their Health.</P>
<P>Of the Branches of this Tree, being very strong and tuff, they make Bowes.</P>
<P>The Small-Pox also rages here much;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Small Pox.</NOTE> and by reason of their unskilfulness in the use of fitting Medicines, proves many times very mortal.</P>
<P>The Land about <HI>Lovando,</HI> for want of convenient Moisture, proves barren;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the Soil</NOTE> but on the opposite side, by the River <HI>Bengo,</HI> fruitful, yielding store of <HI>Mandi∣boka, Mille,</HI> Beans, and many sorts of Fruits and Herbs; which, upon the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> first arrival, was over-grown with Bushes and Brambles: But the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Governor of <HI>Lovando, Ferdinando de Sousa,</HI> in the Years Sixteen hundred twenty nine, and thirty, commanded the Inhabitants, every one acording to the number of Slaves they had, to take each of them a piece of Ground at the River, and clear it from the Bushes, Brambles, and Weeds, and make it fit for Sowing and Planting; by which they brought it to the present Fertility.</P>
<P>This Labor at first was ill resented by the Inhabitants, who were drawn to it with great difficulty; but when they tasted the Profit, and saw the Fruit∣fulness, every one sought to get a Plantation, and took so much Ground as they could Manure. In this manner the Ground was planted with <HI>Mille,</HI> Beans, and all sorts of Herbage; and by Time and Practice the People still improving, became not onely a necessary Plantation, but as it were a pleasant Garden for the whole Countrey. But afterwards, in the Year Sixteen hundred forty one, when the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> took the City <HI>Lovando Saint Paulo,</HI> all was burn'd and ruin'd: So that this Tract of Land, formerly, as we said, a Garden of Plea∣sure, became afterwards a Den for Lions, Tygers, and other wild Beasts: However, after some time a Peace being settled between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> their joynt Endeavors restor'd it to the former Beauty and Fertility.</P>
<PB N="556" REF="350"/>
<P>The chiefest Products of these Parts are small and great <HI>Mille,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> whereof they make Bread; Chesnut-colour'd Beans, call'd <HI>Enkossa,</HI> a fatning and delicate Food, yet too much eating of them causes a pain in the Belly: Also Oranges, Lemons, Dates, <HI>Bananos, Ananasses,</HI> Potatoes, <HI>Cocos, Arosses,</HI> and Palm-oyl-Trees, <HI>Anones, Guajaves,</HI> Wine, or <HI>Gegos.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anones,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anones.</NOTE> so call'd by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> from a Duke which brought this Fruit first thither, is a pleasant Fruit, very delightful in taste, Ash-colour'd, as big as ones Hand, and almost round, like a Pine-apple.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guajaves.</NOTE> or <HI>Gojava,</HI> so call'd by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> by the Natives <HI>Cienko,</HI> and by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> Granate-Pears, is a Fruit very delicious in taste, but the coldness of its Quality makes it thought unwholesom.</P>
<P><HI>Arosses,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arosses.</NOTE> or Granate-plums, a Fruit almost like <HI>Guajaves,</HI> but smaller, whole∣som to eat, and of a pleasing sharp taste.</P>

<P><HI>Tamarinds</HI> also grow here plentifully,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamarinds.</NOTE> and very good. Small <HI>Coco</HI>-Nuts, which by some are taken to be of the same sort, and the same nature against Poyson, as the <HI>Coco</HI>-Nuts of the Island <HI>Maldivia,</HI> lying between <HI>Madagascar</HI> and the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> call'd <HI>Komorri;</HI> and therefore call'd by the <HI>Portuguese, Coquos de Moleva.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maginette,</HI> a sort of Grain like Pepper, but bigger, grows on Bunches, with∣in which are Seeds like those of a Pomegranate; which taken out, shew of a purple or dark red Colour; but afterwards, by drying in the Sun it grows black, and hath a biting taste like Pepper.</P>
<P>There grows also a small Tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper.</NOTE> to the height of three or four Foot, with small and narrow Leaves, whose Fruit bears the resemblance of <HI>Coriander,</HI> at first appearing in green Knots, afterwards in Blossoms, and lastly in a kind of small Grain. These <HI>Benies</HI> grown ripe, and dried in the Sun, shrink like <HI>East-India</HI> Pepper, turning black and hard, and little differing from it in taste, one∣ly not so hot, which makes it pleasant to eat, and fit to be used in all Food. It grows much in <HI>Benyn,</HI> and many other places of <HI>Nether-Ethiopia.</HI> Cotton grows wild here; and if it were manur'd and look'd after, might be had in great abundance: It blossoms in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> and is ripe in <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>Both Garden and Field-Fruits spring here with little Labor; <HI>viz.</HI> Turneps, Radishes, Cabbages, but more open than those with us; Caulyflowers, Car∣rots, Purslane, Spinage, Sage, Hyssop, Thyme, Sweet Majoram, Coriander∣seed, and such like.</P>

No Place in <HI>Angola</HI> besides produ∣ces so much of this Grain; partly caused from the fruitfulness of the Soyl, and partly from the neerness to the City <HI>Lovando Sante Paulo,</HI> where the Markets are always ready to vend it.</P>
<P>This Plant is of divers sorts, which seem all one at a distance, yet both in Roots, Colour, and Worth, are known to be far differing by the Husband∣men.</P>
<PB N="557" REF="350"/>
<P>The Leaves of this Plant resemble those of an Oak, of a deep Green,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Shape.</NOTE> with many Veins and Prickles; the Stemm or Body shoots upright ten or twelve Foot high, spreading with many Branches: the Wood weak, like a Willow, the Blossom small, and the Seed like <HI>Palma Christi,</HI> but of no value; onely the Root may be eaten.</P>
<P>In the Planting and using <HI>Mandikoka</HI> they practice this method: After the Earth is prepared, by being well wrought, beaten small, and thrown up in Hills like Mole-hills, little Twigs or Slips cut off from the Branches of it, about a Foot long, and an Inch thick, are set sloaping one against another, on every Hill two or three Sticks, with the ends about a Hand-breadth above the Earth; which immediately take Root, and in nine, ten, or twelve Moneths, shoot up to the heighth of twelve Foot, with many Branches, and a Body as big as a Man's Thigh: Then to make the Root grow large, the Ground must be Weeded two or three times, and kept clean: And when it is grown to its perfect maturity, they cut the Stemm close to the Earth, being good for no∣thing but Fewel; but the small Boughs they fit for the next Planting,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Root <HI>Mendi∣koka</HI> is ground to Meal.</NOTE> and so from time to time. Afterwards the Root being digg'd up, and the Shell taken from they make it <HI>Farina,</HI> by Grinding it in a Mill made like the Wheels of a Waggon, but a Span broad upon the Soal, Shod with Copper; in which are made many sharp Points in manner of a Grater, and underneath a Trough, into which the Meal falls. He which holds the Root to the Wheel, hath di∣vers little Boys to attend and bring him Roots, as there are Slaves to take the grinded Meal out of the Trough, to dry it in Copper Pans, which to that end like a Furnace stand over the Fire.</P>
<P>For this work many Houses are built, above a hundred Foot long, and thir∣ty or forty Foot broad; wherein on both sides stand the Furnances, that is, on each side ten, and three Mills unfixt, and movable upon occasion from place to place. Every Husband-man may make as much <HI>Farina,</HI> or Meal, as he thinks fit, both for his own use, and to sell; and if he hath a House with twenty Fur∣naces, useth commonly for Planting, Weeding, Howing, Grinding, and Drying, fifty or sixty Slaves. Every <HI>Alquer</HI> of Meal, or two <HI>Aroben,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">One <HI>Aroben</HI> is thirty two Pounds.</NOTE> they sell sometimes in <HI>Lovando St. Paulo</HI> for two hundred and fifty, or three hundred <HI>Rees.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gumm <HI>Almesiga.</HI></NOTE> be∣ing a wholsom Medicine for many Distempers, especially Colds, and bruised Limbs.</P>
<P>From another Plant they extract Aloes, found by experience no worse than that which comes from the Island <HI>Sokotorina.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Orore de Bitios,</HI> an Herb so call'd for its Curing the Disease <HI>Bitios.</HI></P>
<P>By the Rivers side grow the Trees <HI>Mosuma,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tree call'd <HI>Mo∣suma.</HI></NOTE> of which all the <HI>Canoos</HI> in that Countrey are made. This Wood hath some similitude of Cork, and sinks not though it be full of Water. On these Trees grows the <HI>Kapok,</HI> a Woody and soft Stuff, which by Sea-faring People is used in Cushions and Bolsters, in stead of Feathers.</P>
<P>The rest of the Trees are generally call'd <HI>Likonde,</HI> or <HI>Alikonde,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tree <HI>Likonde.</HI></NOTE> delighting in dry Grounds. Some of these enlarge to the thickness of eight, ten, or twelve Fathom in the Body, but the Root never goes above a Foot under Ground, so that the greatest of them may easily be blown down. The Fruit resembles for bigness Palm-Nuts, but somewhat longer, having within, a white Kernel, yet never eaten by the <HI>Blacks</HI> but for hunger and want, for it is a dangerous Food,
<PB N="558" REF="351"/>and causeth great Mortality. The Wood of it is not fit to burn; but of the Peeling of the Rind, as we of Flax, they make Clothes, and Sacks for <HI>Mille;</HI> and of the Stems, or Bodies, <HI>Canoos</HI> and Boats.</P>
<P>In Marshy places grow many Sugar-Canes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sugar-Canes.</NOTE> but by report of the Inhabi∣tants unfit for use, and therefore not much Planted. The Extract of the Cane is brown, yet better than <HI>St. Thomas</HI> to make Sugar-Loaves.</P>
<P>On the Shore of the River of <HI>Kalukala,</HI> and <HI>Ilamba,</HI> they have many delicate Oranges and Lemons, Citrons, Pomegranates, Pears, <HI>Guayavas, Gego's, Ananasses,</HI> and in some places Vines, Planted by the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> for the <HI>Blacks</HI> take no care to propagate foreign Plants.</P>
<P>In the Kingdom of <HI>Angola</HI> are almost one and the same Beasts as in <HI>Congo, viz.</HI> Tygers, Leopards, Lyons, red Buffles, Bears, Wolves, Foxes, very great wild Cats, and Catamountains, the Beast <HI>Makako, Empalanga,</HI> Civet-Cats, <HI>Rhi∣nocerots,</HI> wild Bears, <HI>Emgalla,</HI> and <HI>Camelions:</HI> Besides Cattel for Provision, as Sheep, Goats, Hogs, and the like.</P>
<P>The Woods of this Kingdom, are much frequented by the Beast call'd by the <HI>Africans, Quoias Morrou,</HI> and by the <HI>Indians, Orang-autang,</HI> that is Satyrs, or Wood-Men, found also in the Kingdom of <HI>Quoia,</HI> as is before mention'd, and in the Island of <HI>Borneo</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> This Beast in shape so much resem∣bles a Man, that some have held opinion, that it is of humane mixture with an Ape; which fancy nevertheless the <HI>Blacks</HI> themselves explode.

The Face seem'd like a Man's at a glimpse, but the Nose flat and crooked: it had Ears also like a Man's, and on the Breasts plump Paps, (for it was a Female) and a Belly with the Navel sunk in: the Elbows had also their proper Joynts and Li∣gaments, the Hands had orderly Fingers and Thumbs, the Calves of the Legs and the Feet beyond the Heel-bone, plump and brawny, and would often go upright, and could lift heavy weights, and carry them from one place to another. When it would Drink, it lift up the Cover of the Can with one Hand, and held the other under the bottom, and afterwards wiped the Wet from his Lips with a singular comeliness: it laid it self suddenly to sleep, with its Head upon a Cushion, and cover'd the Body over with Clothes with such dexterity, that any would think it were a Man lay there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blacks</HI> report strange things of this Animal, averring, that it not onely sets upon, and overpowers Women and Maids, but also dares attempt upon Armed Men: in brief, it seems to be the very Satyr of the Antients, whereof <HI>Pliny</HI> and others, by report, and Poets, in the way of Fiction, have Written so much.</P>
<P>The Beast <HI>Goulongo</HI> bears the similitude of a Sheep or Goat,

There is also a certain small Bird, as in <HI>Lovango,</HI> whose Whistling or Singing, being heard by the <HI>Blacks</HI> as they Journey, is by them taken for a certain sign of the approach of some wild Beasts.</P>
<P>The Houses of this Territory are much infected with poysonous Vermine,

<P>The Males have Genitals like Horses, and the Females two strutting Breasts, yet not distinguishable one from the other in the Water, being both of a sad gray colour: they do no hurt, neither come upon the Shore; their Flesh tastes

<P>In the Heads of these Monsters is a certain Bone,

The Bone about the place of the Ear the <HI>Portuguese</HI> wear as a Soveraign Remedy against the infections of ill Air. Of the Ribs, in <HI>Angola,</HI> they make Bead-Bracelets, held to be very good for stenching of Blood, espe∣cially those made of the left Rib, lying next the Heart.</P>
<P>These Creatures are also caught about <HI>Sofala,</HI> on the East-Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and being Salted make good Food at Sea, if quickly spent, but if kept stale, grows ranck, and becomes dangerous Meat for those which have foul Diseases, as the Pox, or such like, in their Limbs.</P>
<P>In these Lakes breed moreover great numbers of Sea-Horses, <HI>Alligators,</HI> or Crocodiles, and many other amphibious Animals.</P>
<P>The Rivers <HI>Quansa, Lukala,</HI> and <HI>Bengo</HI> yield great plenty of excellent Fish; among which great Crabs.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> there are no Houses with Roofs, save onely in <HI>Lovando St. Paulo,</HI> and <HI>Massingan,</HI> both Cities, and built by the <HI>Portuguese.</HI> The rest are made of Sticks and Thatch, very poorly and sleightly, though in some places stronger than other. The Houses of the Nobility have Rooms jetting out, inclosing a Court, and an outward place of Receipt.</P>
<P>Their Musick must needs be very mean and harsh, having but one sort of Instrument, call'd a <HI>Cas,</HI> made Basket-fashion of the Stock of the <HI>Palmito</HI>-Tree, Carved in Flowers, and cover'd with a Board, which being struck yields a Taboring sound.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> the Inhabitants have so great a love for Dogs-flesh, that they feed and fat them in great multitudes, and when kill'd, dress them as a dainty Dish.</P>
<P>Their Clothing comes very near to that of <HI>Congo;</HI> the Ornaments of their Necks and Arms consisting in round Glass-Beads, which they call <HI>Anzalos.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Angolish</HI> Tongue differs from <HI>Congo's</HI> onely in the pronunciation;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> yet that makes it seem another Speech.</P>
<P>The Men, as we said before, may have as many Wives as they can feed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> and the first is accounted the superior of all, if Married according to the <HI>Christian</HI> manner.</P>
<P>A Woman, as long her Children have no Teeth, keeps from her Husband; but as soon as it hath any, all the Friends and Acquaintance, both Men and Women, carries it in their Arms from House to House, Playing and Singing, to receive a Gift for it, and seldom or never are put off with a denial.</P>
<P>When any Person dies, they wind up the Corps, being first washed clean,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funeral.</NOTE> then Combing out the Hair, and putting on new Clothes, they carry them to the Grave, made like a Vault, where they set them upon a Seat of Earth, with many round Glass-Beads, and other Goods about them. Among the better sort Blood is sprinkled upon the Earth, and Wine poured out for a remem∣brance of the Deceased.</P>
<P>The punishment of Offences is done in one and the same manner, that is,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The punishment of Of∣fences.</NOTE> the Offender, together with his Wife and Children, and their whole Stock, are made Slaves to the <HI>Sova's.</HI> But sometimes they accuse not one another, but work their own revenge, by poysoning of their Adversary.</P>
<P>In the Enquiry they take no care whether the Party be guilty, or punisha∣ble indeed, but the Saying of the <HI>Sova's,</HI> or Averment of one single person, car∣ries the Cause.</P>
<P>In stead of Money they use, as in <HI>Lovando,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clothes are their Money.</NOTE> the small Clothes call'd <HI>Libon∣ges,</HI> and <HI>Panos Sambos,</HI> whereof we gave you there a full account.</P>
<P>Of these some are single marked, with the Arms of <HI>Portugal;</HI> others double marked; and some unmarked.</P>
<P>The single-marked Clothes, as also four unmarked, ty'd together, go for a half <HI>Tester,</HI> and one alone for two Pence; but every double-marked Cloth is worth ten or eleven.</P>
<P>None of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> may bring those Clothes into <HI>Lovando,</HI> but onely the Factor of the Merchant who dwells at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and sent thither to buy them up, whereof he makes no small Gain.</P>
<P>Out of <HI>Benyn</HI> come blue Cotton-Clothes, by them call'd <HI>Mouponoqua,</HI> but by the <HI>Portuguese, Panos res gatto de Berre;</HI> they are five Clothes together, and a a Yard and a half, or two yards broad. There is another sort, in <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Pannos de Komma de Figures,</HI> of blue and some white mingled, with Fi∣gures, about six or seven Yards long, and above a Yard broad. Both these sorts the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vend in great quantities, and at high Prices in <HI>Congo, Amboille,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Gingo,</HI> and other Places.</P>
<P>The like small Clothes are brought from the Island <HI>St. Thomas;</HI> but the Dye is not so good, and the Stuff courser. These they exchange for Slaves, to send into <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>They have two sorts of <HI>Simbo's,</HI> which serve in lieu of Money, <HI>viz.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Simbo's,</HI> or little Horn-Shells.</NOTE> pure <HI>Simbo's,</HI> taken under the Island of <HI>Lovando,</HI> and used for Trade in <HI>Punto;</HI> and impure, or <HI>Brazile,</HI> brought from <HI>Rio de Janero,</HI> and used in <HI>Songo</HI> and <HI>Pinda,</HI> and in the Countreys of <HI>Anna Xinga,</HI> beyond <HI>Massingam,</HI> and among the <HI>Jages.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Simbo's</HI> of <HI>Lovando</HI> are also of two sorts, a finer and a courser, separated by Sifting, the latter they name <HI>Simbos Sisado's;</HI> the other, <HI>Fonda</HI> and <HI>Bomba.</HI> Both these they send to <HI>Congo,</HI> being carried thither upon the Heads of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> in Sacks made of Straw, every Sack weighing two <HI>Aroba's,</HI> that is, three∣score and four Pound.</P>
<PB N="562" REF="353"/>
<P>They use also in <HI>Lovando,</HI> in stead of Money, the red <HI>Takoel</HI> Wood of <HI>Ma∣jumba,</HI> and <HI>Pio de Hikongo,</HI> brought from <HI>Benguella;</HI> which cut into Pieces of about a Foot long, have their set value, which every one knows.</P>
<P>The Fruit <HI>Cola</HI> is there commonly sold for Clothes, four Fruits for one <HI>Li∣bongo,</HI> or unmarked Cloth.</P>
<P>The chiefest Trade of <HI>Portuguese</HI> and other <HI>Whites,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> consists in Slaves, carried from thence by Shipping to several Places in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> as to the Islands of <HI>Porto, Rico, Rio Plata, Santo Domingo, Havana, Carthagena,</HI> and to the Main Land, especially to <HI>Brazile</HI> and other Places, to labour in the Engines and Sugar-Mills, and to dig and work in the Mynes; which toyl these <HI>Angolian Blacks,</HI> and no <HI>Whites</HI> can undergo: so that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> must thank the la∣bour of Slaves for most of their Riches which they possess in the <HI>Indies.</HI> It is certain the <HI>Spaniard</HI> used heretofore to send over upon his own account to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> every year above fifteen thousand Slaves for those Works; and 'tis judg'd, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to this day send no fewer.</P>
<P>All those Slaves the <HI>Portuguese</HI> cause to be bought by their <HI>Pombero's,</HI> as is be∣fore related, above a hundred and fifty, and two hundred miles up in the Countrey; from whence they bring them down to the Sea-Coast.</P>
<P>These Slaves get but little Food on the Way, and lie on the bare Ground every Night under the open Heaven, without any other Covering, by which means they grow poor and faint: but the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in <HI>Lovando,</HI> before they Ship them away, bring them first into a great House, which they have built there for that purpose, and give them their fill of Meat and Drink, and likewise Palm-Oyl to refresh and anoint themselves withall: But if it happen that there be no Ships ready, or that they have not Slaves enough to send away, then they use them for tilling the Ground, and to plant or cut <HI>Mandihoka:</HI> but at last when they put them on Board, they take great care to preserve them from Sickness; and that they may come safe and sound to their intended Port, provide Medicines, especially Lemons and white Lead, to use against the <HI>Bitios;</HI> and if by chance any fall sick, they separate him from the rest, and lay him alone to be Cured, where he is well provided for with warm Diet.</P>
<P>In the Ships they have Mats to lie on; of which they take great store with them, especially when they go over to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> to give every ten or twelves days a fresh Mat.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> take no such care in transporting their Slaves to <HI>Brazile,</HI> but strip them poor and faint, without any Provision of Mats or other things, by which means many die at Sea.</P>
<P>In the Village <HI>Kambamba</HI> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> deal for many Slaves, but not so much as in <HI>Massingan</HI> and <HI>Embakko;</HI> for there when the adjacent <HI>Blacks</HI> want any Mer∣chandise, they bring their Slaves to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Colonies for exchange.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants in general gather no great Riches, being content with a lit∣tle <HI>Mille,</HI> and a few Cattel, together with Palm-Wine and Oyl.</P>
<P>Their Arms consist in Bowes and Arrows, but the chiefest have Lances, Axes, and Chopping-Knives; which last they wear in their Girdles on their left sides: in short, they use almost the same Arms, as those of <HI>Congo,</HI> and ob∣serve the same order in Fighting.</P>
<P>This Countrey is so populous, that the King can in a very short time bring a hundred thousand men all Volunteers into the Field; and if occasion requires, ten hundred thousand press'd Souldiers; so that if they were as valiant as nu∣merous, they might well be dreaded: but their little courage, and less conduct hath appear'd in several Encounters with the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> particularly, in the year Fifteen hundred eighty four, twelve hundred thousand <HI>Angolians</HI> were put to flight by five hundred <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and some few <HI>Congians:</HI> And the following year, Six hundred thousand <HI>Angolians,</HI> by two hundred <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and ten thou∣sand <HI>Blacks.</HI></P>
<P>The Territory of <HI>Ilamba</HI> can raise twelve thousand men, Arm'd with Bowes and Arrows, who Fight very circumspectly, and Shoot lying or creeping on the ground.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Angola,</HI> or rather <HI>Dongo,</HI> hath at present a particular Gover∣nor or Prince, who acknowledges no kind of subjection to the King of <HI>Congo;</HI> although formerly, when divided into divers Lordships, the several <HI>Sovasen</HI> shew'd all due obedience to that King.</P>
<P>But a hundred and fifty years since, one of these <HI>Sovasen</HI> call'd <HI>Angola,</HI> with assistance of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> Trading with him, made Wars with the other, and overcame them one after another, till he made them all Tributaries; yet he let them still remain in possession, each of his own Dominion.</P>
<P>This was he that afterwards came to the Crown, and nam'd himself <HI>Incue,</HI> from the great multitude of people under his subjection; and was not inferior in Power (saith <HI>Pigafet</HI>) to the King of <HI>Congo:</HI> to whom (as <HI>Linschot</HI> writes) he sends Presents, though he be not his Vassal.</P>
<P>After this <HI>Angola Incue,</HI> in the year Fifteen hundred and sixty, his Son <HI>Dambi Angola,</HI> a great enemy of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> was chosen King, who Deceas'd in the year Fifteen hundred seventy eight, and his youngest Son, <HI>Quilonge Angola,</HI> or <HI>Angolaire,</HI> that is, <HI>Great Lord,</HI> was left his Heir and Successor to the Crown.</P>
<P>He renew'd the old League made by his Predecessors with the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Paulus Dias de Nevais</HI> their Governor; but afterwards without cause, cut off thir∣ty or forty of them on the way, going with several Merchandizes to the Royal City; whereupon <HI>Dias</HI> made War upon him, and took many places, subject∣ing them to the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which ever since, together with many other, from time to time subdu'd, have remain'd under them.</P>
<P>The King deceasing in the year Sixteen hundred and forty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anna Xinga</HI> cannot come to the Crown.</NOTE> without Male∣issue, left three Daughters, and a Nephew; the eldest of these call'd <HI>Anna Xin∣ga,</HI> notwithstanding she was Baptiz'd a Christian, would assume the Crown
<PB N="564" REF="354"/>after the Heathenish manner: But the <HI>Portuguese</HI> favour'd the Nephew, and so helped him with assistance of Arms, that by force he gat the Throne; whereupon <HI>Anna Xinga,</HI> with many Grandees, fled, but hath never ceas'd to claim the Kingdom as her Inheritance, alledging her Nephew but an Usurper.</P>
<P>In this Quarrel she fought three several Battels,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">She is several times over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>.</NOTE> and was as often routed and vanquish'd, and hath since kept her self an hundred and fifty miles up into the Countrey, beyond <HI>Embatta;</HI> where, notwithstanding her former ill successes, making new Wars towards the Wilderness <HI>Jages,</HI> she has gotten many Cities, Villages, and Countreys; whereby gathering fresh Vigor, she came again up∣on the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> by whom, under the Command and Conduct of <HI>Major Pa∣vo Darouva,</HI> Conquer'd, and two of her Sisters taken Prisoners; one of which Baptiz'd <HI>Dama Maja,</HI> of her own free will continu'd among the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and kept her self stately according to her manner, oftentimes receiving many Slaves for her maintainance.</P>
<P>According to the last accompts, this <HI>Xinga</HI> can be little less than sixty years of age, and oftentimes for some past years, hath been reported dead; yet the Subjects conceal'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">She keeps her self secret.</NOTE> and kept it so secret, that notwithstanding the <HI>Portuguese</HI> consign Commodities thither for Trade by several persons, they cannot by ours or others attain the certainty thereof: For all Decrees, Orders, and Trans∣actions relating to Government, are still Proclaim'd in her Name.</P>
<P>She is a cunning and prudent <HI>Virago,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">She is warlike.</NOTE> so much addicted to Arms, that she hardly uses other exercise; and withal so generously valiant, that she never hurt a <HI>Portuguese</HI> after Quarter given, and Commanded all her Slaves and Souldiers the like.</P>
<P>She and her People (for the most part) lead an unsetled life,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her Idolatry.</NOTE> roving up and down from place to place, like the <HI>Jages:</HI> Before any enterprize undertaken, though of meanest concern, they ask councel of the Devil; to which end they have an Idol, to whom they sacrifice a living Person, of the wisest and com∣liest they can pick out.</P>
<P>The Queen against the time of this Sacrifice, Clothes her self in mans appa∣rel, (nor indeed does she at any time go otherwise habited) hanging about her the Skins of Beasts, before and behind, with a Sword about her Neck, an Ax at her Girld, and a Bowe and Arrows in her Hand, leaping according to their Custom, now here, then there, as nimbly, as the most active among her Attendants; all the while striking her <HI>Engema,</HI> that is, two Iron Bells, which serve her in stead of Drums.</P>
<P>When she thinks she has made a show long enough,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">She sacrificeth men.</NOTE> in a Masculine manner, and thereby hath weary'd her self; then she takes a broad Feather and sticks it through the holes of her boar'd Nose, for a sign of War.</P>
<P>She her self in this rage, begins with the first of those appointed to be sacri∣fic'd; and cutting off his head, drinks a great draught of his blood.</P>
<P>Then follow the Stoutest Commanders, and do as she hath done; and this with a great hurly-burly, tumult, and playing upon Instruments about their Idol.</P>
<P>Among all her most pretious things, she bestows no such care on any, as the Bones of one of her Brothers, who Raign'd before her, which lie together in a costly Silver Chest, long before gotten of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen keeps fifty or sixty young men in stead of Husbands, each of which may have as many Wives as they please, with this proviso, that if any of them be with Child, themselves must kill the Infant as soon as born.</P>

<P>In the year Sixteen hundred forty eight, the four and twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> the third day after the New-Moon, according to the relation of one <HI>Fuller,</HI> a Com∣mander in the Service of the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> who was appointed with sixty men to assist this Queen against the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and in that regard, stay'd so long time with her, that one of these her Gallants had a hundred and thirteen Wives, without any offspring; for that after the manner of their Devillish Superstition and Idolatry, he cursedly made away, or kill'd their Children.</P>
<P>The Queen us'd this very Custom at that time; neither dare any of those se∣lected young men own their Sex, or mention hers: And for the more orderly concealing thereof, she clothes them in Womens Apparel, according to her man∣ner, and goeth her self in Mans Habit; giving out, that they are Women, and she a Man. All these have Womens names, but the Queen (her self) a Mans, especially in the Army, and will acknowledge no otherwise; nay her Favorites dare not say the contrary, upon the peril of their Heads: and as a testimony herein of their obedience and constancy to her, permits them to go freely among her women; and if they fail in their obligations, they seldom escape to tell further news.</P>
<P>In the year Sixteen hundred forty six, she over-ran with her Army,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruin'd <HI>Oando.</HI></NOTE> and spoyl'd all the Villages of <HI>Oanda,</HI> and made the Inhabitants Slaves.</P>

<P>The four and twentieth, the Fleet came within sight of Land, and <HI>Hinderson</HI> went the same day with his Souldiers, set in order against the City, ordering the Snap-hances to March in the Van. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> Governor, <HI>Caesar de Mene∣ses,</HI> stood not far from thence on the Shore, with nine hundred <HI>Whites,</HI> and Arm'd Inhabitants, and a great many of <HI>Blacks;</HI> besides two Pieces of Ordnance, in a Fighting Posture.</P>
<P>But so soon as the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> came near, and began to fall on,

<P>Two days before the appearance of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, the Governor had some notice of it, but supposing the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had come onely to fetch a Booty of Slaves and other Goods, and so to return; gave order, that his Wives and Children, with the best Goods and readiest Merchandize,

<P>Most of their woodden Idols are made up in the shape of a Goat, with a Tor∣toise head, feet of Beasts, and small bones of Elephants, which they call by a ge∣neral name <HI>Ganganjumba,</HI> through which (they say) the Devil speaks to them.</P>
<P>For the service of these Idols they have Priests call'd <HI>Ganga's,</HI> which they

<HEAD>The Island of LOVANDO.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the City <HI>Lovando Sante Paulo,</HI> in eight degrees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island <HI>Lovando.</HI></NOTE> and eight and forty minutes South-Latitude, lies the Island of <HI>Lovando,</HI> five miles with its North-Point to the West of the River <HI>Bengo,</HI> making a good and con∣venient Haven for Shipping. The whole being not above seven miles in length, but in the broadest place, it is not above half a League over; insomuch as those that Sail by in a Ship, may easily see the Sea run between it and the main Land.</P>
<P><HI>Pigafet</HI> supposes it to have begun from the setlings of Sand and Mud, thrown up there in heaps, by force of the two greater Waters of <HI>Bengo</HI> and <HI>Quansa.</HI></P>
<PB N="570" REF="357"/>
<P>The whole spot appears an even Champaign, but very dry and Sandy, one∣ly in some places may be seen a few Bushes and Brambles; and on the North∣side, here and there, some Haw-thorn Shrubs. The Land by the Sea-side shoots down so steep and sloaping, that the Sea, not above a Musket-shot from the Shore, hath above seven or eight and twenty Fathom Water; and a mile from thence a Line of a hundred Fathom can reach no ground.</P>
<P><HI>Pigafet</HI> places on this Island seven Towns,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns call'd <HI>Libar.</HI></NOTE> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Libar,</HI> or <HI>Libata;</HI> but <HI>Linschot</HI> will hardly allow them Villages, however the <HI>Portuguese</HI> at∣tribute to the best, the title of <HI>Sante Esprit.</HI></P>
<P>Here are two Churches or Chappels for the exercise of Religion; and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have divers Gardens and Orchards, wherein grow Oranges, Lem∣mens, Citrons, Pomegranates, excellent Figs, <HI>Bananos,</HI> Coco-nuts, Grapes and other Fruits; but Corn is so great a stranger to it, that they are compell'd to fetch Supply from other places.</P>
<P>This little Tract produces the great Tree, by the Natives call'd <HI>Ensada;</HI> by <HI>Clusius,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Fig-Tree; by <HI>Linschot</HI> in <HI>Portuguese, Arbor de Raiz,</HI> that is, the Rooting-Tree.</P>
<P>It springs up commonly with one thick body to a great height, at the top shooting forth many branches; from which pendulously descend several small Strings of a Golden colour, which once touching the ground, take fast root, and spring up again like new Plants, and in short time, increase to a large Bulk; from whence, as the former, fall new Pendulums, that rooting again, spread; and so <HI>ad infinitum:</HI> so that sometimes one single Tree will extend its bounds above a thousand paces, and seems like a little Wood or Thicket.</P>
<P>The great Sprouts with so many close Boughs, deny the Sun-beams a peep∣ing place to view the inside of those vaulted Cavities, whose redoubled Mazes yield three or four times reiterated Ecchos, to such whose retirements draw them thither for divertisement and shadow.</P>
<P>The Leaves of the young Boughs, resemble those of the Quince-Tree, being of a whitish green, and woolly. The Fruit within and without red, springs be∣tween the Leaves of the young Branches, like an ordinary Fig.</P>
<P>Very credible eye-witnesses report, that under one of these Trees, three thou∣sand men may shelter.</P>
<P>Under its outermost or first Bark,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of its Bark, Clothes are woven.</NOTE> they find somewhat like a Thred or Yarn, which being beaten, cleans'd, and drawn out at length, the common People make Cloth of.</P>
<P>This Tree grows also in <HI>Gon,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> where the Inhabitants, by cutting away the thin Boughs, make Arbors under them for cooleness and shade.</P>
<P>It seems contrary to the ordinary rules of experience,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pigafet.</HI></NOTE> and therefore strange, that digging here two or three hands breadth deep, very swift Water rises at the time of the Seas flowing; whereas digging at the time of ebb, it cometh forth salt or brackish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Islanders</HI> use <HI>Canoos,</HI> of the bodies of Date Trees joyn'd together, in which they fight at Sea.</P>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Jages</HI> abode here, but the <HI>Portuguese</HI> drove them out in the year Fifteen hundred seventy eight, and pursu'd them to <HI>Massingan;</HI> at the same time raising a Fort there for their security.</P>
<P>Under this Island are the <HI>Simbos</HI> taken up,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here is the fishing of <HI>Simbos.</HI></NOTE> which carry'd to <HI>Congo</HI> and other places, go for current Money; so that this place may justly be term'd, the Mint of <HI>Congo.</HI></P>

<P>This Island obeys the King of <HI>Congo,</HI> although by report,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island <HI>Lovando</HI> is un∣der <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> beyond it he doth not possess one foot of ground Southward of <HI>Bengo,</HI> upon the main Land; how∣ever by that he claims to himself all the Revenue of the Fishery aforesaid, and hath his Governor to oversee the same, and take the King's due, which is in∣deed what he pleases, and by compute amounts to eleven thousand Duckets An∣nually. And although on all the Shores of <HI>Congo,</HI> these fashion shells are found, yet those of <HI>Lovando</HI> have the highest esteem, by reason of their thin and shining black or gray colour.</P>
<P>This Island makes the Haven before the City <HI>Lovando,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barra de Korimba.</NOTE> where lieth two En∣trances, one on the South, call'd <HI>Barra de Korimba,</HI> formerly bearing above five Fathom water, but is at present almost fill'd up, and choak'd with Sand: on the other side of this Entrance, heretofore the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had two Batteries, but the force of the water hath almost wash'd them away.</P>
<P>About two miles from <HI>Barra de Korimba,</HI> on the main Land,

<P>The Natives here, need not complain of Nature as a Step-mother; the Land without any great labour producing abundance of <HI>Mille</HI> for Bread, besides other useful Plants and Trees: as particularly</P>
<P>The <HI>Alikonda,</HI> eight or ten Fathom round, but very porus and weak;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees <HI>Alikenda.</HI></NOTE> fit for no use, but to make Trays to hold water: their innermost Bark some convert in∣to a kind of Thred, whereof they make Aprons or Coats to wear about their bodies.</P>

The same juyce pour'd into the water, will immediately cause the Fish to swim at the top, as if they were dead.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blacks</HI> hold the shadow of this Tree poyson, and will not be perswaded to rest under it; for they say, that the juyce is so great a corrosive, as 'twill gnaw their bowels in pieces, without possibility of help or Antidote; as hath been experienc'd by a Lord, that was poyson'd with it by his Slaves.</P>
<PB N="572" REF="358"/>
<P>The Beasts breeding in these Parts,

<P>Fresh Water they have none,

<P>This they dig out in Pieces of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ell long, and a Hand broad, every one weighing eighteen or twenty Pounds, as clear as a piece of Ice or Crystal, and as white as our best Salt, and of so good a savor, that a little Piece put in a Pot or Kettle, give both the Liquor and Meat a pleasant seasoning.</P>
<P>From the bowels they dig Iron,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iron-Mynes.</NOTE> but enough onely to make Arms and Im∣plements for Tillage or Husbandry.</P>
<P>The best Trade of these <HI>Quisamites</HI> consists in the fore-recited Salt and <HI>Mille,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> which they exchange for Slaves to be employ'd in the digging of it, for they work not themselves, out of an opinion of their noble Extract.

<P>THis Countrey Modern Geographers place at the Sea-Coast, and make it spread from the River <HI>Quansa,</HI> to <HI>Cabo Negro,</HI> in the heighth of six∣teen Degrees; though others will have it go farther than <HI>Rio Longo,</HI> in eleven Degrees and four Minutes South Latitude. The Places, Rivers, Bays,
<PB N="573" REF="358"/>and Villages, lying at the Sea-Coast within that compass, may be these:</P>
<P>About three miles from the South Point of <HI>Quansa,</HI> lieth <HI>Maysotte-Bay;</HI> before which a small Rock hides it self. Three miles and a half forward you arrive at <HI>Cabo Ledo;</HI> And five from thence appears <HI>Cabo de tres Puntas.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabo Ledo.</NOTE> And two miles yet Southerly <HI>Cabo Falso;</HI> And five beyond that, another.</P>
<P>Six miles and a half from <HI>Cabo St. Bras,</HI> lieth <HI>Hens-Bay,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hen-Bay.</NOTE> so call'd from the abundance of Hens thereabouts; and between both, <HI>Benguella Viella,</HI> that is <HI>Old Benguela,</HI> a Champaign and very fruitful Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hen-Bay</HI> contains about a mile and a half in breadth, holding ten or twelve Fathom Water, with muddy Ground. On the South-side stands a great Village on a Hill, where large Cows, Sheep, Hens, and Elephants-Teeth may be had; yet they have no fresh Water.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio Lengo.</NOTE> otherwise call'd <HI>Rio Moreno,</HI> in eleven Degrees and four Minutes South Latitude, so shallow at the Mouth, that a small Boat cannot go in or out without difficulty.</P>
<P>In former times the <HI>Portuguese</HI> attempted to enlarge the Entrance into this River; but by reason of its shoalness, the strong Water-falls, and great num∣bers of Rocks, they found it not feasible.</P>
<P>Five miles from <HI>Rio Longo</HI> appears a great Village, nam'd <HI>Manikikongo;</HI> upon the Ascent a high Mountain, where the <HI>Portuguese</HI> once had a Store-house, and bought Cows, Hogs, and Elephants-Teeth, for Linnen and <HI>East-India</HI> pressed Clothes.

<P>Eleven miles from <HI>Manikikongo</HI> runs the Salt River <HI>Katon-belle,</HI> dividing it self in two or three Branches, being free from all Winds, and hath fifteen and six∣teen Foot Water, so that the great Ships may come before it.</P>
<P>About the North Point of <HI>Katon-belle</HI> lieth the <HI>Good Bay,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Bay.</NOTE> so call'd by reason of its ground of Anchoring.</P>
<P>The Countreys upon the Sea-Coast are fruitful and low, but the In-lands high, and overgrown with Woods.</P>

<P>Here formerly lived some <HI>Portuguese,</HI> which afterwards out of fear of the <HI>Blacks</HI> fled to <HI>Massingan,</HI> but were most of them kill'd in the way.</P>
<P>On the West Point of the Bay of <HI>Benguelle,</HI> is a flat Mountain call'd in <HI>Por∣tuguese Sombriero,</HI> from its shape, representing afar off a three-corner'd Cap; and by it an excellent Bay, having at the South-east-side a sandy Shore, with a pleasant Valley and a few Trees, but no Water fit to drink.</P>

<P>Four miles from thence they have a Salt-Pan, which produces of gray Salt, (like <HI>French</HI> Salt) as much as the adjacent Countreys can spend.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beast <HI>Abada.</HI></NOTE> call'd <HI>Abada,</HI> as big as a lusty Horse, having two Horns, one sticking out in his Forehead, and another behind in his Neck: that in the Forehead is crooked, but smooth, rises sloaping before, and very sharp, but at the Root as thick as an ordinary Man's Leg, being many times one, two, three, or four Foot long; but that in the Neck shorter and flatter, of colour black, or a sad gray, but being fil'd appears white, the Head not so long as the Head of a well-shaped Horse, but shorter and flatter, with a Skin Hair'd like a Cow, and a Tail like an Ox, but short; a Mayn like a Horse, but not so long, and cloven Feet like a Deers, but bigger.</P>
<P>Before this Beast hath attained the full growth, the Horn stands right forward in the midst of the Forehead, but afterwards grows crooked like the Elephant's-Teeth. When he drinks he puts his Horn first in the Water, for prevention (as they say) against Poyson.</P>
<P>The Horn they report to be an excellent Medicine against Poyson,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Horn is good a∣gainst Poyson.</NOTE> as hath oftentimes been proved; but they find more efficacy in one than another, oc∣casioned by the timely and untimely killing of the Creature.

<P>These, upon information received by advice of one of their own People, by them call'd <HI>Nomoa,</HI> and by the <HI>Netherlanders, Doman,</HI> who went from thence to <HI>Battavie</HI> in one of the Companies Ships, and stay'd there five or six years, observing their actions with such inquisitive diligence, that he remembred no small part thereof. <HI>Doman</HI> being come again to the <HI>Cape</HI> in those Ships which were order'd for <HI>Holland,</HI> kept a great while amongst them in <HI>Dutch</HI> Habit;

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epkamma</HI> taken.</NOTE> and a great Wound in his Head; being thus wounded, he was taken, and brought on a Horse into the Fort, but <HI>Doman</HI> with the other escaped, swimming over a River.</P>
<P>The wounded <HI>Epkamma</HI> being brought into the Fort,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Discourse concern∣ing the beginning of the Wars with the <HI>Netherlan∣ders.</HI></NOTE> and asked for what reason they did make War with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> and sought to do mischief every where by robbing, murdering, and burning, though excessively pained with his Wounds, return'd this answer: What was the reason that the <HI>Ne∣therlanders</HI> Ploughed their Land, and Sow'd Corn on their Ground, where they should drive their Cattel to Pasture, and by this means took the Bread out of their Mouthes; That to revenge themselves of the injury and wrong that was done them, they fought; for they were not onely forbidden to keep away from those and other Pasturing places, which they had possessed peaceably so long (whereinto they had permitted the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> onely in the beginning, to come as a refreshing-place) but they saw also their Countreys divided and ta∣ken away without any recompence. At last, asking if the same had been done to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> how they would carry themselves? Moreover they understood, that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> did strengthen themselves daily with Forts; which according to their opinion, could be for no other end, but to bring them and all what they had at length under subjection. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> repli'd in short, That they had now lost the Countrey about the <HI>Cape</HI> by the War, and therefore they should never think to regain it either by Hostility or Peace.</P>
<P>The last Discourse of this <HI>Epkamma</HI> (who died on the sixth day) was, That he was but a mean Person, but he advised them to invite his Governor to the Fort, and to discourse the business with him, and to order every one his own again as it could best be found, for the prevention of farther mischief and trou∣ble.</P>
<P>This being held for good counsel, two or three <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were sent abroad, with Entreaties to the Governor <HI>Gogosoa</HI> to come to the Fort, and to Treat concerning a Peace; but all in vain: for they went on furiously against such Places as they saw fit; insomuch that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> scarce saw any means how to decide this matter for the best. The placing and appointing of good Watches to secure the Planters, which lived but two hours Journey from the Fort, signifi'd but little; for those <HI>Hottentots</HI> drove away all their Cattel, and were so quick and nimble in the action, that it was impossible to overtake or retrieve them.</P>

<P>Ten or eleven Moneths were spent by these Salvages, in murdering, rob∣bing, and stealing; but at last the Quarrel was decided in this manner:</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what manner the War was laid aside.</NOTE> and by the Natives, <HI>Kamcemoca,</HI> being banished to <HI>Conney-Isle</HI> for a Crime committed, after three Moneths abode there, went in a dark Night with another Compa∣nion, in a leaky Fisher-boat, furnished with two Oars, the Wind serving them fitly, and came to the Main Land, where they found their Friends the <HI>Gora∣chouqua's</HI> and <HI>Goringhaiqua's.</HI></P>
<P>The Escape of these two being told to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governors, he sent six <HI>Dutchmen</HI> abroad, to go and seek so far along the Shore, till they found the Boat or some signs of them. Whereupon they being provided with Victuals for four or five days, went out, and the next day found the Boat above thirty miles from the Fort, in a fine small Sandy Bay, with the Oars by it, and some Grass in the same; so that it seem'd as if they had taken their nights rest therein: but they met no people in all their journey; onely they saw some Rhinocerots, Elephants, and other wild Beasts. So after four days they came again to the Fort.</P>
<P>At length the aforemention'd <HI>Herry</HI> or <HI>Kamcemoca,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herry</HI> comes to the Fort.</NOTE> in the Year Sixteen hun∣dred and sixty, in <HI>February</HI> came to the Fort with the Governor of the <HI>Negery,</HI> call'd <HI>Chori,</HI> accompani'd with a hundred other people, but all without Arms, and bringing with them thirteen fat Cattel, desiring they would receive the Cattel as acknowledgment of Friendship, and to permit them free egress and regress amongst them, as formerly: Which accepted, it was further agreed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difference decided.</NOTE> That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> might Sowe as much Ground, with Corn and other Seed, as was within the compass of three Hours Journey; but with this Proviso, That they should not Plow any more Ground than was already Plowed.

<P>After a little time, the General of the <HI>Goronghaiqua's,</HI> or <HI>Caepmans, Gogosoa,</HI> made an Agreement and came with <HI>Chori</HI> to the Court,

<P>When the Men began to be intoxicated, and their Heads fail them, there were about two or three hundred little pieces of Tobacco thrown amongst them, in the scrambling for which, they made a horrible noise. The noise and hurly-burly over, they began to leap and dance,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their strange Dance.</NOTE> with several strange Gestures; the Women in the mean while clapping their Hands, and continually singing, <HI>Ha, ho, ho, ho,</HI> with so great noise as might easily have been heard a Bowe-shot from the Fort.

<P>After these Exercises, the chief of them were presented with Coral,

<P>THe <HI>Heusaqua's</HI> lie North-West-ward from the <HI>Great Cape;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heusaqua's.</NOTE> but so far distant, that little knowledge hath been gained of them, and that from bare report, none having ever seen their Countrey, or been among them; the best Intelligence hath been drawn from the Mouths of three of themselves, that came to the Fort of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> with the Governor <HI>Chainou∣qua's,</HI> to sell some Cattel, and returned with all convenient speed.</P>
<P>These <HI>Heusaqua's</HI> onely maintain themselves with Planting (for the rest of the <HI>Hottentots</HI> neither Sowe nor Plant) of a powerful Root,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maintain themselves by planting the Root <HI>Dacha.</HI></NOTE> which they call <HI>Dacha;</HI> sometimes eating it, otherwhiles mingling it with Water to drink; ei∣ther of which ways taken, causeth Ebriety. When they become intoxicated therwith, they play many strange and antick Tricks, as if they were mad; in the middle of which the Women come and strew the dried and pulverized Herb <HI>Boggoa</HI> on their Heads, being of a yellow colour, and strong scent, and for that onely use fetch'd from the Mountains.</P>
<P>These People have great skill in the catching both old and young Lions in Snares, which they make tame, and lead with a Rope about their Necks like a Dog. Some of their Lions, which they have had along time, they frequent∣ly carry to the Wars, and by that means put their Enemies to flight without any resistance: A thing that seems very strange, yet most certainly used amongst them.</P>
<P>All the Places of <HI>Kafrarie,</HI> known by the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> generally lie at the Sea-coast, being principally Capes, Bays, and Havens; for Towns or Vil∣lages there are none, the Savage Inhabitants contenting themselves with the homely Covert of moveable Huts, after the manner of the wild <HI>Arabs.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey shoots very far into the South,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabo de Bona Esperanza,</HI> or <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></NOTE> shewing several Capes and Promontories; amongst which, the cheifest the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> or <HI>Cabo de Bona Esperanza,</HI> lieth in four and thirty Degrees and one and twenty Minutes South Latitude. When this Point was discover'd, and why so call'd, we have before related.</P>
<P>The next and most Southerly Point of <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Cabo das An∣guilhas,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabo das Aiguilhas,</HI> or <HI>Needle-Cape.</HI></NOTE>

It was so call'd by them from the Compass-Needle, which they observ'd to stand due South and North at this Point; but several late experienc'd Sea-men affirm it to vary five or six Degrees from the North, West-ward.</P>
<P>Here lieth a great Shelf of Sand, full of Fishes, which extends eighteen Miles into the Sea, beginning in the West by the <HI>Sweet River,</HI> and ending in the East at the <HI>Fish-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>Between these Points,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabo Falso,</HI> or <HI>False Cape.</HI></NOTE> in the Height of four and thirty Degrees and a half, five or six Miles Eastward of the <HI>Hope,</HI> appears <HI>Cabo Falso,</HI> or <HI>False Cape;</HI> for Sailing out of <HI>India,</HI> and making this <HI>Cape</HI> in clear Weather, they mistook it for that of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> by reason of its near resemblance to the same; but coming nearer, they found their Error. This <HI>Cape</HI> may be known by three high Hills, near adjoyning to each other, whereof the two outermost are highest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> appears in the form of a hanging Island, with a small <HI>Isthmus</HI> between two Bays, joyn'd to the Main Land, and contains several high and craggy Mountains; of which, two more remarkable, the <HI>Table,</HI> and the <HI>Lion</HI>-Mountain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Table-Mountain,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Table-Mountain,</HI> or <HI>Ta∣ble-Cape.</HI></NOTE> in <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Tavoa de Cabo,</HI> lieth about an hours Journey from the Shore, Southward of the <HI>Fresh</HI> and <HI>Salt River,</HI> and hath re∣ceived that name from its shape, because it is flat on the top like a Table.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Salt River</HI> they climb up this Mountain by a Cliff, in all other places not being ascendible, by reason of its great steepness; and that way, asks four or five hours Labor to gain the top: And this height makes it visible above ten Leagues to the <HI>Offin.</HI> Against ill Weather, two or three Hours before, 'tis so co∣ver'd with thick Mists and Clouds, that they cannot discover the top.</P>
<P>Close by <HI>Table-Mount,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fragosos.</NOTE> lie those towring Hills in a row, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Os Picos Fragosos.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lion-Mountain,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lion-Mountain.</NOTE> so call'd either from the abundance of Lions upon it, or because it appears out at Sea like a Lion, lieth somewhat more Westerly, and closer to the Sea than the <HI>Table:</HI> so that its Tail makes the Point at the end of the Bay. Between these two appears a pleasant Valley.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Table</HI> riseth another,

<P>Beyond these, to the South, you come to a Valley over-grown with Bram∣bles, other Bushes, and Wood.</P>
<P>Further up into the Countrey are some standing-Waters, over-grown with Bulrushes, Canes, and Sedg-weeds, wherein breed many Wild-fowl, Geese, Duck, Teal, Snipes, and such like.</P>
<P>Along the Sea-coast several good Bays or Creeks open themselves, affording convenient Havens for Ships.</P>
<P>Eighteen Miles North-West from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> lieth <HI>Soldanha-Bay,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soldanha-Bay. Memoires de</HI> Thomas Roe.</NOTE> where the <HI>Soldanhars</HI> have their chief Residence.

<P>A Governor Commands this Fort, assisted by two Merchants, a Book-keep∣er, or Clerk, Accomptant, some Assistants, and a Serjeant over the Souldiers; all which are chief Men and Councellors.</P>
<P>Without this Fort, divers free people of several Nations have their residence, transported out of <HI>Holland;</HI> and maintain themselves chiefly by Tillage and Planting, but they pay for their Priviledge a part of their Harvest to the Go∣vernor for the Benefit and Advantage of the Company.</P>
<P>In the Latitude of four and thirty degrees, and forty minutes, Eastward of the <HI>Needle-Cape,</HI> lieth another Bay; first call'd <HI>Flesh-Bay,</HI>

<P>Between these are three <HI>Capes</HI> plac'd in the Maps, <HI>viz. Cabo de Sante Fransisko, Cabo das Sorras,</HI> and <HI>Cabo do Aregito,</HI> and an Isle call'd, <HI>The Island of Content.</HI></P>
<P>Somewhat higher Northerly, the River <HI>St. Christopher</HI> glides along;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio de Santo Christian.</NOTE> the <HI>Por∣tugnese</HI> call it, <HI>Rio de Sante Christian,</HI> and the Inhabitants <HI>Nagoa;</HI> in whose Mouth three Islands are seen.</P>
<P>Next this River appears a Tract of Land, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Terra de Natal,</HI> that is, <HI>The Land of the Nativity of Christ;</HI> so call'd, from the day of its first discovery.</P>
<P>The Southermost Countrey of these parts, is water'd by three known,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> be∣sides many other unknown Rivers, <HI>viz. The Sweet,</HI> and <HI>Salt River,</HI> and <HI>Rio de Jak∣quelina.</HI></P>
<P>Just about the foot of <HI>Lion-Mountain,</HI> flows the <HI>Sweet River,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweet-Rivers.</NOTE> which takes its beginning out of the descent of <HI>Table-Mount,</HI> and runs down very swiftly through, not above knee-deep. <HI>Pigafet</HI> will have this River take its Original out of the Lake <HI>Gale,</HI> between the Mountains of the <HI>Moon</HI> on the West-side, and to fall into the Sea by <HI>False-Cape:</HI> whereas the common <HI>African</HI> Maps place there the River <HI>Kamissa.</HI></P>
<PB N="586" REF="367"/>
<P>To the East, beyond <HI>Terra de Natal,</HI> opposite to this little River, in the year Sixteen hundred forty and four, some few <HI>Dutchmen</HI> erected a Fort or Bulwark, with four Angles, for the defence of this fresh water, but they never finish∣ed it.</P>
<P>Half a mile Eastward runs the <HI>Salt-River;</HI> so call'd from its plenty of Salt, for on a great place of Sand, three or four miles upwards, by heat and drought so much fine and white Salt continually grows, that a Ship might soon be La∣den therewith.</P>
<P><HI>Rio de Jackquelina</HI> hath its Original within the Countrey, and its Out-let about half a mile Eastward into <HI>Table-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Air, quality of the Soyl, Plants, Beasts, Customs, Food, Cloath∣ing, Arms, Language, Religion and Worship, of this people in general; we cannot say much, that little we shall speak, will have onely relation to the <HI>Hot∣tentots,</HI> lying close to the <HI>Cape,</HI> as the <HI>Garouchouquas, Goringhuiquas, Goringhaiconas, Cochoquas,</HI> or <HI>Saldanhans,</HI> great and little <HI>Cariguriquas,</HI> and <HI>Hosaas;</HI> for of the rest, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Vanouquas, Cabonas, Sonquas, Mamaquas, Heusaquas, Brigoudys, Hancumquas,</HI> hitherto little or no information hath been had, other than that in general they agree with those that lie nearest to the <HI>Cape.</HI></P>
<P>The Air about the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Good-Hope</HI> is always Serene,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Air.</NOTE> Clear, and Tempe∣rate, and by consequence very Healthy, because neither the Heat parches, nor the Cold pierces too much. In <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> blow the stiffest and sharpest storms of Wind from the Southerly Points, which continue till <HI>December,</HI> mix'd with Mists, Snow and Frost; so that the waters in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> are often Fro∣zen the thickness of the back of a Knife.</P>
<P>The Vale-Winds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wind.</NOTE> or Hurricans, blow sometimes so terribly from the Moun∣tains, which are commonly cover'd with thick Clouds, which hover there, and break with that violence, as if all above ground would be rent to pieces. At this time, when the Winds bluster and tear so horribly, they make a hollow Sea at the Point, which too often proves dangerous for Ships.</P>
<P>It Rains there in the Winter, that is, in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> so extreamly, as if it did almost pour down, whereby the low grounds are laid under Water, yet with∣out any prejudice; for after the falling away of the Water, the ground appears more fresh and flourishing.</P>
<P>The Soyl about the <HI>Cape,</HI> is in some places very rich and ferile, fit to be Husbanded, and to produce all manner of Fruits; although other parts be full of Clay, Stony, Gravelly, or Sandy: some Trees grow here and there, but so hard and knotty, as makes them fit onely for Fuel: yet the natives report, that in the Countrey there grow such Trees, that a hundred men may shelter them∣selves under one of them; perhaps the Indian Fig-Tree, by <HI>Linschot</HI> call'd <HI>Ar∣bar de Rais.</HI></P>
<P>There grow in the Winter,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> especially among the <HI>Saldanhars,</HI> certain little roots which they eat; some of them have a taste like Anniseeds, others like <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI>-Artichokes, others as Acorns.</P>
<P>The Valleys and Plains under, lie verdur'd with Grass and sweet Herbs, which being boyl'd with fresh Meat, make a pleasant Sallet.</P>
<P>Close by the Fort of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> on a Mountain call'd, <HI>The Vineyard,</HI> the <HI>Ne∣therlanders</HI> have Planted forty thousand Vine-stocks, which all at this day send forth lusty Sprouts and Leaves, and bear Grapes in such abundance, that some∣times they press Wine of them: They have there also Peaches, Apricocks, Ches∣nuts, Olive-Trees, and such like Fruits.</P>

<P>There grow wild upon the Mountains, and in the Valleys, and on the banks of the Rivers, many other sorts of Plants; as among the rest a peculiar sort of Tulips, <HI>Sempervive, Fritillaria,</HI> or Speckled Lillies, Penny-Wort, or Dragon-Wort with sharp pointed Leaves, Sorrel with knotted Roots, and white Blossoms.</P>
<P>The Tulip bears a bole bigger than ones fist, having thick Shells,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cape</HI>-Tulip.</NOTE> but of a faint smell. The Blossom that shoots out before the Leaves in <HI>April,</HI> of a very high red colour, appearing very gloriously, and hath five broad, long, and thick Leaves; within having whitish red Stripes, and at the end a round Stalk of a span long, streak'd and speckled with purple upon a white ground. It grows upon the Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sempervive</HI> or House-Leek, hath Leaves almost a finger thick, whitish green, and as big almost as the Palm of ones Hand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fritillaria,</HI> or the speckled <HI>Narcissus,</HI> which some reckon as a sort of <HI>Denti∣laria,</HI> or <HI>Eminie;</HI> hath in stead of Leaves, Sprouts of a fingers length, thick and juicy, with sharp and round broken edges like Teeth, of a pale purple above, and underneath green: At the Leaves comes a flower that hath five limber Leaves, sharp at the ends, with a high Crown or Tuft in the middle, hollow within, inclosing another flower, which hath also five Leaves, all yellow, but of a dark-brown at the ends, with some very red standards in the middle: this Plant hath no smell, and grows upon barren and Sandy Mountains.</P>
<P>The Sorrel with knotted Roots, shoots up a span in height, hath hard, pale green Leaves, long and slender, which stand aloft on the Stalk five or six toge∣ther, for below the Stalk is void of Leaves.</P>
<P>In the very Sea it self, about the <HI>Cape</HI> may be seen several Plants, <HI>viz.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea-Plants.</NOTE> a Fort of Canes; by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Tromba's,</HI> which grow with Moss, being large and thick, in the fashion of a Cornet; some such (but longer) are found on the <HI>Cape,</HI> and the Island of <HI>Tristan de Cunba;</HI> from whence <HI>Linschot</HI> saith it flotes along, driven by the Wind thence to the West side of the <HI>Cape,</HI> near the Shore,
<PB N="588" REF="368"/>upon sight whereof, the Sea-men infallibly know they are near this Coast.</P>
<P>Also <HI>Sargossa,</HI> a kind of a Lentil, drives along, being an Herb like Sedge, or Wild-Cresses; which are to be seen an hundred miles far and wide in the <HI>Ethio∣pian</HI> Sea, driven upon heaps.</P>
<P>They have also Coral, Tortoise-shells, Pearls, and in the <HI>Salt-River</HI> pure white Salt.</P>
<P>About <HI>Cabo das Aiguilhas,</HI> or <HI>Needle-Cape,</HI> are Sharks-bones found, which the Goldsmiths use; although some are of opinion they came from the Sea-Cat or <HI>Bleach,</HI> with which that Sea abounds.</P>
<P>In the particular relations of this Countrey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cattel.</NOTE> we told you they had great store of Cattel; We will now onely add, That the Oxen are very fair, fleshy, and thick, and some near half a foot higher than those among us; with very fine, slender, and long crook'd Horns: Others have their Horns flat and hang∣ing down loose by their bodies.</P>
<P>They have infinite flocks of Sheep, very large, with long Legs, and Hair in stead of Wool; their tails are nothing but fat, and some of them so heavy, that they have weigh'd eighteen or twenty pounds and more.</P>
<P>The Woods, Valleys, and plain low Gronds, feed many wild Beasts; as Stags or Harts, Roe-Hindes, and wild Cows, who run together by sixty, seven∣ty, yea a hundred in a Head. Badgers, of a red colour, but so slow in running, that a man may easily outstrip them, yet their flesh is accounted a pleasant food. Wild-Bears, Wild-Goats, Hares, Conies, Ringstreak'd Tygers, a fierce and dan∣gerous Beast, Leopards, Wolves, <HI>Rhinocerots,</HI> and Elephants.</P>
<P>On the tops of the Mountains, keep multitudes of fierce Lions, which in dark Moons come out of their hideous Dens of shelter, and seek their prey close un∣der the Fort; and therefore they always about the Inclosure (where the Cattel are kept in by night) kindle great fires to scare them away.</P>
<P>There are found great Beasts like Elephants, with two Horns at their No∣ses, such as the <HI>Rhinocerots</HI> hath one. It ordinarily goes swifter than a man, in its speediest course, hath a skin with short Mouse-dun hair, a tail and feet like an Elephant, streight and round ears, and a short bunch of black hair, in stead of a Mane on the Neck.</P>
<P>Here have been seen many Jack-alls, being a creature that by his quick scent discovers prey for the Lion, and is both his Guard and Spie.</P>
<P>The Ocean also produces many Creatures, as Sea-Rabbits, Sea-Dogs, Sea-Wolves, or Sea-Bears, who in the Summer swim in the Sea, but in the Winter remain under ground, and keep on Shore, and in the Cliffs.</P>
<P>The Sea-Wolves, or rather Sea-Bears, because with their paws and gestures more resemble Bears than Wolves, onely they have sharper Snouts, and are a fiercer Creature, biting cruelly; they exceed men for the most part in swift∣ness of running, so without two or three they are not to be taken.</P>
<P>On the Shore of the Rivers, are many Sea-Horses, Porcupisses, or Sea-Hogs, and Sea-Cats.</P>
<P>Many sorts of small and great Fowls are found here;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowls.</NOTE> as Partridges, Ducks, Sparrows, Geese, Wild-Ducks, Parrets will yellow Bills, More-hens, Wagtails, Gulls, Teal, Wood-Snipes and Water-Snipes, and Cormorants, being a black sort of Fowl, as big and as large as Ducks or Geese.</P>
<P>Here also breed the <HI>Pinguyns,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pinguyns.</NOTE> with small thick Feathers, more like Bristles or Beasts Hair than Plumes; in stead of Wings they have a Leather Finn on each Foot, wherewith they swim; they have very tough Skins, are cruel in
<PB N="589" REF="368"/>biting, ready in diving, and keep as well in the Sea as at Land. They harbor in the Sedges, lie in a Burrow scraped out hollow, and lay their Eggs in the Sand, to the number of four or five, bigger than Goose-Eggs, and with a white Shell. They have so slow a pace that we easily catch them, or follow them to their Nests, which they defend with biting, and are not to be forced thence without Staves. Their Flesh is Oylie, and not good to eat, except they be two or three times boyl'd in fresh Water, and then fry'd in a Pan with Butter or Suet.</P>
<P>There are also Moor-Cocks, Marsh-Fowl, with red Bills and Legs, wild Peacocks, white Shovelers, as big as a Hen, with a Neck in two or three Joynts, Herons of three sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> blue ones, white ones, of a middle size, and black, as big as Sea-pies, which keep most in Moorish places; Cranes, several kinds of Hawks, Peacocks, Pheasants, Partridges, Ravens, Crows and Ostriches.</P>
<P>The Bird <HI>Flemengos</HI> increases here numerously; in bigness like a Goose,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flamengo's.</NOTE> with long and red Legs, Bills, and Wings; the other parts have all white Feathers.</P>
<P>Also white Lapwings, which flie so boldly, that they will come to the Muzzle of a Gun.</P>
<P>The Fowls which come from Land and frequent the Sea, are of divers sorts, as the <HI>Antenagas,</HI> great speckled Fowls, which many times sit upon the dry places within the Water about the <HI>Needle-Cape.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alcatraces,</HI> a gray Fowl, almost like a Lapwing.</P>
<P>Pheasants, little bigger than Swallows, white-feather'd, with gray or black Specks, ringstreaked, and speckled in their Bodies, and therefore easie to be known from the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gavoitoyns,</HI> or <HI>Dyvers,</HI> which sit in the Water about the <HI>Cape.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Garagias,</HI> almost the same with the <HI>Alcatraces.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jan-van-Genten,</HI> or white Plovers, tipt with black at the end of their Wings.</P>
<P>Another sort of great Fowls, call'd in <HI>Portuguese, Mangas de Velludo,</HI> or <HI>Velvet-Parrots,</HI> have black Tufts like Velvet on their Wings, and in flying hold them not steady, but flutter as Pigeons.</P>
<P>As the Air is thus replenished with good Fowl, no less doth the Sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishes.</NOTE> and other Waters abound with the variety of Fish, particularly one sort call'd <HI>Huygen,</HI> in shape like Carps, being of a very pleasant taste.</P>
<P>Rough Mullets, Lobsters, Breams, and Crabs, of a large size.</P>
<P>Mussles also among the Rocks, and great and small Oysters with Pearls in them.</P>
<P>In <HI>Table-Bay,</HI> and thereabouts, play many Whales, and other great Fishes.</P>
<P><HI>Bottle-heads,</HI> out of which may be boyl'd Train-Oyl as well as out of Whales.</P>
<P>The People which dwell about, and near the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Constitution of the <HI>Kaffers,</HI> or <HI>Hottentots.</HI></NOTE> are of a mid∣dle Stature, Slouch-body'd, and uncomely of Person; of a Tawny colour, like <HI>Mulletto's:</HI> But those about <HI>Flesh-Bay</HI> are somewhat smaller. The Hair of their Heads in general resembles Lambs Wool, short and Curl'd, but the Womens thicker than the Mens, especially among the <HI>Cobona's.</HI> They have broad Fore∣heads, but wrinkled, clear and black Eyes, but all, both Men, Women, and Children, have <HI>Camosie</HI>-Noses, and blab-Lips. Their Mouthes well fashion'd, and bearing a proportionable bigness every way, with very clean and white Teeth. Their Necks are of an ordinary length, with narrow Shoulders, and long Arms, but about the Wrists very thin, their Hands well shaped, their
<PB N="590" REF="369"/>Fingers long, letting their Nails grow like Eagles Talons, which they count an Ornament. Most of them have their Bellies long and wrinkled, with But∣tocks sticking out. Their Legs handsom, but small Calves, little Feet, especi∣ally the Women. They are swift of Foot, and so strong, that some can stop an Ox in his full course.</P>
<P>The Women are little of Stature, especially among the <HI>Cochoqua's,</HI> or <HI>Saldan∣hars:</HI> and some cut their Faces, as if they were drawn with a Pencil. The Married Women are so great Breasted, that they can give them into the Mouthes of their Children to Suck behind over their Shouldets, where they commonly carry them.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Kaffers</HI> are void of Literature,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are Unlearned.</NOTE> stupidly dull and clownish, and in understanding are more like Beasts than Men: but some by continual con∣verse with <HI>European</HI> Merchants, shew a few sparks or glimmerings of an incli∣nation to more humanity.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this their bruitish ignorance, they observe the Laws and Customs of the Countrey with as much seriousness and observance, as the most orderly People in <HI>Europe;</HI> as a proof whereof you may take this Instance: In the Year Sixteen hundred fifty nine, when the <HI>Cape-men</HI> happen'd to be at ods and controversie with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> being asked what cause they had for that Quarrel; gave for answer, that it was onely in return of the wrong done them by the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> in taking away their Seed and Lands, as before we have more fully related.</P>
<P>In kindness and fidelity towards their Neighbors,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are kind and faith∣ful.</NOTE> they shame the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and all other <HI>Europeans,</HI> because whatsoever one hath, they willingly and readi∣ly impart it to others, be it little or much.</P>
<P>Sometimes by eating the Root <HI>Dacha,</HI> mixed with Water, they become Drunk, and then go about, not knowing what they do; others constrain'd by poverty, seek here and there to take what they can find from any body; but if it happen to come to light, their Skin must pay dear for it.</P>
<P>There appears also among them some sparks of Pride: for when they come to the <HI>Fort of Good Hope,</HI> they cast on their filthiest, greaziest, and most stinking Skins, and adorn their Ears and Necks with red and yellow Copper Beads, supposing themselves exceeding pompously dressed.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the meanness and poverty of their Condition, yet they bear a high mind, and are ambitious; they will rather fall to open enmity, than

<P>Their Clothing is very sordid,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Clothing of the Men.</NOTE> and vile, most of the Men wearing onely a Sheeps Pelt, or Badgers Skin, in manner of a Mantle about their Shoulders, with the hairy side commonly within, and ty'd under their Chin.</P>
<P>Such a Mantle consists of three Pieces, neatly sew'd together with Sinews of Beasts in stead of Threed. When they go abroad, or upon a Journey, they throw another Sheeps-skin, with the Wool on the out-side, over the under∣most. Upon their Heads they wear a Cap of Lamb-skin, with the Woolly side inward, and a Button on the top.</P>
<P>Their Shoes are made of a <HI>Rhinocerot's</HI> Skin, and consists of a whole flat Piece, before and behind of a like heighth, with a Cross of two Leather∣bands fasten'd to their Feet. Before their Privacies hangs a little piece of a wild Wood-Cat, or ring-streaked Tyger, or Jack-alls Skin, ty'd behind with two Thongs.</P>

<P>The Habit of the Women differs little from the former,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit of the Wo∣men.</NOTE> being a Sheep-skin Mantle on the upper part of their Bodies, with the Wool inwards; but some∣what longer than the Men; also another Skin hanging behind to cover their back-parts, and a square Piece before their Privacies.</P>
<P>On their Heads they wear a high Cap of a Sheeps, or Badgers Skin, bound to their Heads with a broad Fillet: In all the rest following the Mens Garb.</P>
<P>No less uncomely are their choycest Ornaments, for the Men have their Hair dressed up, or adorn'd with Copper-plates, white little Horns, and great Beads. They pull all the Hair out of their Chins, and daub their Faces with Black, and then anoint them with Grease and Tallow, and thereby seem as if they never were washed.</P>
<P>Those which dwell close by the <HI>Cape</HI> on the Shore, and come to the <HI>Nether∣landers</HI> Ships, presently run to the Cook's Kettle, or Pottage-pot, and anoint themselves with the Soot thereof, which they esteem a Princely Ornament.</P>
<P>Such as are rich, and have good stocks of Cattel, liquor the out-side of their Mantles and Caps with Grease; whereas the Poor wear them starved and un∣liquor'd. Also most of the Princes and Kings, and Kings Daughters, parti∣cularly the King of <HI>Cocoquas,</HI> his Vice-Roy, and Daughter <HI>Mamis,</HI> wear fat be∣smear'd Skins. In their Ears they hang great bunches of Beads, of which some contain ten or eleven Strings, each weighing near a quarter of a Pound. A∣bout their Necks they put red and yellow Copper Chains, or Bracelets of Beads, and upon their Arms Ivory Armlets, and forwards near the Wrists, Bracelets of Copper, which stick so close, that it makes their Arms sore, and sometimes come to ulcerate before they will lay them off.</P>
<P>Many of them wear as an Ornament, the Guts of Beasts, fresh and stink∣ing, drawn two or three times one through another, about their Necks, and the like about their Legs.</P>
<P>Some wear a sort of Roots gather'd from the bottoms of Rivers, which in their Journeys through Woods, where Lyons, Leopards, and Wolves fre∣quent, by the Fire side (which they kindle at the Place where they stay all night, for the driving away wild Beasts) they chew into little bits, and spit out of their Mouthes round about, with firm perswasion, that there is such vertue in them, as no Beast can endure the smell of it.</P>
<P>When they go abroad they have usually an Ostrich Feather, or a Staff, with a wild Cats Tail ty'd to it, in one Hand, in stead of a Handkerchief to wipe their Eyes and Noses, and beat away the Dust, Sand, and Flies, and in the other Hand a sleight Javelin.</P>
<P>The Women never go abroad without a Leather Sack at their backs, ha∣ving at each end a Tuft or Tassel, and fill'd with one trifle or another.</P>
<P>Their Weapons, or Arms, are Bowes and Arrows, and small Darts, three, four, or five Foot long, having at one end a broad sharp Iron fixed, which they handle and throw very dexterously.</P>
<P>Their Food consists generally of onely a sort of round Roots,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> of the bigness of Turnips, digg'd out of the Rivers and other places, and then boyl'd or roast∣ed to eat. They kill no great Cattel, but such as either by sickness, lameness, or age, are unfit to follow the Herd; nor any Sheep, except at a Wedding. They are utterly ignorant in all sorts of Cookery, and therefore fall upon dead Cattel like Dogs, eating it with Guts and Intrails, the Dung onely thrust out; and when they can find no defunct Beast, they look out dead Fish on the Shore;
<PB N="592" REF="372"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> as also Snails, Catterpillars, and Mussles. They find great relish in the Flesh of Sea-Dogs, or Badgers, which they kill in the Night, coming by thousands on Shore, with Sticks, and either raw, or half cold, and unwashed, they broyl in the Fire, and eat; not forbearing the most noysom Grease of Whales and other Draff cast on Shore. Train-Oyl, and Grease of a Stranded Whale at the Salt-River, broyl'd out by the Sun, they sup up by whole handfuls, and cut Collops out of the Flesh, which they bury under the Sand to eat after∣wards. Some time they tear pieces of their dry'd hard Sheeps-skin Mantles or Cloaks, with their Teeth, and eat it.</P>
<P>They take great delight in our Bread, for which they are willing to barter Cattel. The Honey found in the Woods they eat up Wax an all; and in stead of Physick administer to the Sick, Cabbages, Coleworts, and Mustard-Leaves, with a little beaten Lard boyl'd with it.</P>
<P>Their common Drink is Water,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drink.</NOTE> or <HI>Mille;</HI> but they are very greedy of Bran∣dy or <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, as also of Tobacco, but quickly become Drunk with it.</P>
<P>They use no Trades, Handicrafts, or Arts; with Bulrushes make Mats, wherewith they cover their Houses; they Forge the sharp Heads of their Lan∣ces being Iron; in the doing whereof they use onely a Stone and Hammer, making it malleable with Wood-Coals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Goringhaica's</HI> dwelling by the <HI>Cape,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Employment.</NOTE> employ themselves in Fishing, which they sell to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> for Bread and Tobacco. Most of the other have no skill therein, nor any Vessels to go out to Sea, so that in all Journeys they go by Land, and on Foot. In stead of Horses they have great Oxen, who carry their Goods and Commodities from one place to another, which they lead and guide with a Stick thrust through their Noses, as with a Bridle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cochoqua's,</HI> or <HI>Saldanhars,</HI> are a kind of Herdsmen, and live by keeping of Cattel, whereof they have above an hundred thousand Head, all very fair, be∣sides as many Sheep. The like do the <HI>Cariguriqua's</HI> and <HI>Hosaa's:</HI> None amongst them all Sowe, or Plant, but onely the <HI>Heusaqua's.</HI> When they perceive any
<PB N="593" REF="372"/>wild Beasts in the Night, whether Elephants, Elans, Rhinocerots, Lyons, Ty∣gers, Bucks, or Horses, then all the stoutest Men run forth, and make a great noise to fright them away. But if by day any devouring wild Beast appear, then all that can carry Arms go forth, every one provided with two or three <HI>Assagays,</HI> or Lances, and encompassing the same with extraordinary outcries and shoutings, they let fly their Darts, and Shoot, as at a Mark to wound and kill him.</P>
<P>When a person falls in Love with a Maid, he desires of his Father,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> that he may Marry her, who consenting, he goes to the Father and Mother of the Maid, entreating the same: and when the Parents grant his Suit, the Daughter receives, and as a sign of her acceptance, and in confirmation of the Marriage, she puts about his Neck, not a Gold Chain, but a fat Cows Chitterling, which he must wear till it drop off. Then two of the fattest Sheep are sought out of the whole Flock, and kill'd, part of whose Flesh being boyl'd, and part of it roasted, none may eat but the Marry'd couple and their Parents; and with∣out this Ceremony the Marriage would not be accounted lawful. The Skins cut in small pieces, and the Hair taken off, then beaten upon a Stone, and so laid on hot Coals, they eat with a very great appetite. This pitiful Feast end∣ed, the solemnity of the Wedding is over.</P>
<P>As to their constancy in Love, they are as in other places, some quickly nauseating the ties of Marriage, while others observe it with a most affectio∣nate strictness. For the manifesting of the constancy and true Love amongst some of these Salvages, we will give you two remarkable Stories, the one of a Widow, which through excess of grief and sorrow for the death of her Hus∣band, leapt into a Pit full of Wood, set it on fire, and burnt her self to death: the other of a young Maid, which for grief threw her self down from a Rock, because her Parents had caus'd her Lover to be severely whipt with Thorns, for Lying with her against their consents.</P>
<P>Whether by the goodness of the Air, or the natural strength of their Consti∣tutions, these People attain so great an age, as generally they do, remains a doubt; but this is certain, that most of them live to eighty, ninety, or a hun∣dred, and some to a hundred and ten, twenty, or more years.</P>
<P>They bury their Dead sitting in a deep Pit stark naked,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funerals.</NOTE> throwing the Earth upon their Heads with a great heap of Stones over all, to preserve the Corps from being raked out of the Grave by wild Beasts.</P>
<P>When a Man or Woman dies,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inheritance.</NOTE> all the Friends to the third degree of Consan∣guinity, must by an antient custom cut off the little Finger of their left Hand, to be bury'd with the Dead in the Grave; but if the Deceased had in his Life any Cattel, and leaves some Relations to whom they might come by Inheri∣tance, they must cut off a Joynt from each little Finger before they can take the Cattel: for the Sick cannot giveaway the least thing on his Death-bed, from those to whom it falls by Inheritance.</P>
<P>As soon as any one falls sick, those about him fetch one skill'd in Herbs, who with a sharp two-edged Knife lets them blood on their Back, then burns them on their Arms, with a red hot Iron, and drops thereon some Juyce of Herbs, with new boyl'd sweet Milk: And if this work not a Cure, they give them over for Dead.</P>
<P>Those which rob in the Day, if they be catcht in it, are beaten by the King, or <HI>Choeque</HI> himself with a Stick, without other punishment; but those which Rob in the Night, receive upon discovery a more severe punishment
<PB N="594" REF="373"/>in this manner inflicted. The Offender is first for a whole day tied Hand and Foot, being neither allowed Meat or Drink: On the second day some of the Eldest go to the <HI>Coehque,</HI> to ask if they shall proceed in the Execution, which is done without any Condemnation or Tryal, but not without sufficient Te∣stimony; whereupon the King, with a great Train of People following him, comes to a Tree, where he commands the Offender to be brought before him, whom they bind to the Tree, and very severely whip all over his Body, that the Blood runs down to his Feet. After this, being turned with his Face to∣wards the King, a sort of Gum, or Rozin, melted in a Pot, is poured over his naked Body, from his Neck running down upon his Breast, so that the Skin immediately peels off; then they let him loose, and give him some Meat, wherewith a little refresh'd, they tie him again Neck and Heels, and so leave him three days: And lastly, after the enduring all this pain, he is sometimes banish'd, and thrust from their Society.</P>
<P>When any are found in Fornication,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Incest.</NOTE> the Parents force them to Marry imme∣diately, if they have a competency of Estate: But if that cannot be effected, then they wait to know if the Woman be with Child; and then they enforce a Conjunction, though the Person be so mean that he cannot maintain a Wife.</P>
<P>When any Person, Rich or Poor, is discover'd to have committed Incest, they believe such People cannot be punished enough, because they say it is an unpardonable offence; and this from the meer Light of Nature: And there∣fore they punish the Transgressors with death; the manner this.</P>
<P>First of all the Man hath his Hands and his Feet drawn together with a Cord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are punish'd.</NOTE> and so put into a Tub till the next day, and the Woman set by it. The second day they take him out, and so Manacled set him under a Tree, fastning his Head to a strong Bough, which one pulls and holds down; then they cut off one Member after another: Afterwards they let the Bough spring up again, with the mangled Body upon it, for a Spectacle to other Evil-doers.</P>
<P>The Man thus dead, they bring forth the Woman, whom bound round about with many dry Shrub-Bavins, her Hands and Feet tied fast together, they set Fire to the Bushes, and so burn her to Ashes.</P>
<P>A little above five years ago it hapned that a certain Person, a great Friend and Acquaintance of the <HI>Coehques,</HI> or King of the <HI>Saldanhars,</HI> committed Incest; yet for all that, without respect to his Person, he did Justice upon him.</P>
<P>If any Man of Wealth and Quality,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punishment for killing and wounding.</NOTE> or reputed Wise, through fury or rage stab or wound another to death, they take him and beat his Brains out against a Tree, and put him into the Grave with the murdered Person; for they say, Such a Person being endued with more Understanding, ought to know better, and to give a good Example to others: Whereas on the other side, poor sim∣ple People are permitted to ransom their Lives by a Payment of Cattel. Some, for Offences which deserve Death, have their Knees nail'd through, and an Iron Pin fast driven into each Shoulder, so dying a lingring death.</P>
<P>They live like the <HI>Arabians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Houses.</NOTE> in the Fields, in Huts made of slender crooked Poles, set round and cover'd with Bulrush-Mats: Some of these are so large, that conveniently ten or twenty Men, with Women and Children, may dwell in one of them; though others are much less, and some so small, that they can take them up, and run away with them. The Fire-place lieth in the midst of the House; but they make no Funnels to carry up the Smoke.</P>
<P>They kindle Fire with an excellent dexterity, by rubbing one little hollow∣ed Stick upon another very hard for a great space.</P>
<PB N="595" REF="373"/>
<P>All these <HI>Hottentots</HI> speak one and the same Language,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> which for the diffi∣culty of the pronunciation cannot be learn'd, to the great retarding and hin∣derance of further Discoveries. In all Discourse they cluck like a Broody Hen, seeming to cackle at every other Word: So that their Mouths are almost like a Rattle or Clapper, smacking, and making a great noise with their Tongues.</P>
<P>Some words they know not how to utter, but with very much ado, and they seem as if they fetch'd it out behind, at the bottom of their Throats, and as the People in <HI>Savoy</HI> that live near the <HI>Alps,</HI> who by drinking Snow-water have great Crops or Swellings under their Chins. <HI>Brokwa</HI> in their Language sig∣nifies <HI>Bread, Kahou</HI> denotes to <HI>sit down, Bou</HI> is <HI>an Ox, Ba, a Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Kori, Iron:</HI> But now many of them which dwell close to the Fort of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> by daily Converse with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> speak <HI>Dutch;</HI> as some who have been with the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Bantam,</HI> stammer some broken <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>They have no inclination to Trading,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> neither hold they any Correspon∣dence with Foreign People. iron and Copper were the onely Commodi∣ties desired by them; the former for Arms, the other for Ornament; both which they so esteemed, that in a Voyage to the <HI>Indies,</HI> in the year Fifteen hun∣dred ninety five, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had in Barter with these People, for a Cutting-knife, a fair Ox; for a Bar of Iron of seventy pounds, broken into five pieces, two Oxen and three Sheep; for one Hook-knife, one Bill, one Ax, one short Iron Bolt, and some pieces of Iron, three Oxen and five Sheep; and for a Knife, one Sheep. But at this day, grown wiser by Converse, and the abundance of Commodities carried thither, they prize their Cattel at a much higher rate, and their former fair dealing is not now found amongst them.</P>
<P>Tobacco, Brandy, and Copper, they chiefly desire at present; but the yel∣lower the better: So that for four pieces of Copper, as big as the Palm of ones Hand, and a piece of Tobacco, they usually buy two Cows.</P>
<P>Some of these People have Elective, others Successive Kings or Governors;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> but all their Powers not able to make above four or five thousand Men, and those living dispersedly in several Plantations, far distant from each other.</P>
<P>Religion is an absolute stranger among all these Salvages,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> insomuch that they never worshipped either God or Devil; yet they say and believe there is a Divine Power, which they call <HI>Humma,</HI> which causeth Rain, Winds, Heat, and Cold; but will not worship him, because he sends sometimes too much Heat and Drowth, and another time an overflux of Rain, contrary to their desires.</P>
<P>Secondly, They imagine, that they can stop the Rain, and allay the Wind at their pleasure. First, To cause Rain to cease, they lay a small Cole of Fire on a Chip, in a little Hole digged in the Ground; and upon that Hole they lay a Lock of Hair pull'd from their Heads, and cover up the Hole with Sand; when the Hair begins to stink, then they make Water upon it, and so run away shrieking. To lay the Winds, they hold one of the greasiest Skins upon a long Stick aloft in the Air, till the Wind has blown down the Skin; and then vainly think the power of the Wind smothered thereby.</P>
<P>When the New Moon begins first to be discerned, they commonly in great Companies turn themselves towards it, and spend the whole night in great joy, with Dancing, Singing, and Clapping of Hands.</P>
<P>They have a Musical Instrument, made with a String like a Bowe, and a split Quill at the end, which being blowed yields a low sound.</P>

<P>The Wealth of this Countrey consists in Gold found in Mines and Rivers;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches. <HI>Ja rik</HI> lib ca 42. <HI>Sanut.</HI> lib. 1.</NOTE> which though little valu'd, yet they narrowly search for, because they find it necessary for the Purchase of Outlandish Merchandizes.

<P>Their Arms are Bowes, Arrows, Ponyards, and Hangers, or Scymitars.

<P>The Emperor keeps continually a strong Army, consisting all of Foot, for they have no Horse; besides a stout Party of Valiant <HI>Amazonian</HI> Women, which March and Fight as well as the Men, burning off their left Breasts, that they may shoot with the more readiness and ease. They carry the same Arms with the Men, and shoot backwards or behind them when they fly; but when they observe the following Enemy to Retreat and draw off, they suddenly face about, and fall upon them, committing great Slaughter.</P>
<P>None washes their Hands or Face during the Wars: Every one carries his own ordinary Provisions; but the King provides Sheep and Oxen. They cut off the Members of those they take in Battel, and drying the same, present it to their Wives, to wear for an Ornament about their Necks; and she that wears most of them, hath most respect, because it testifies her Husbands Valour.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Portuguese</HI> became Masters of this Coast,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government. <HI>Osor. de Rebus Emanuel.</HI> lib. 4.</NOTE> all the Kings acknow∣ledg'd this of <HI>Monomotapa</HI> for their Emperor; and still several of them own him, and pay Tribute yearly.</P>
<P>The Emperor hath several Great Lords his Vassals; and for the better hold∣ing of them in Obedience, according to an ancient Custom, keeps their next Successors, upon pretence to be honorably brought up, in his Court; though in truth to be as Hostages for their Fidelity. He sends also Agents every year to his Substitute Kings and Lords, to give them new Fire, with command to put out all the other. When the Agent comes to the Court of one of these Lords, every one must put out his Fire, and not kindle it again before the Agent has made a new one, from whence all the Subjects of this Lord must fetch and carry it into their Houses. He that seems unwilling in this Work, is taken and punish'd for a Mutineer.</P>
<P>The King keeps commonly a thousand Women, or more, being all Daugh∣ters of his inferior Lords; but the first married commands the rest, let her be never so mean.</P>
<P>The Chief Sovereign is call'd <HI>Benomotapa,</HI> that is, <HI>Emperor,</HI> or <HI>Munnemotapa,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Title of Honor. <HI>Jos. Barres.</HI> lib. 10. ca. 1.</NOTE> according to the Relation of <HI>Texeira</HI> a great Traveller.</P>
<P>The King receives and expects extraordinary Honors from his Subjects, by whom serv'd on the Knee, as we have said; onely the <HI>Portuguese, Moors,</HI> and

<P>The King and all his Justices, are very strict in the prosecution of their Of∣fice and Duty, to punish Offenders with great severity.</P>
<P>The Sentences of these Judges are establish'd by the Emperor, and the Of∣fender immediately punish'd: As soon as any one hath committed an offence, he is punish'd in the Field, while the Fact is fresh in memory; but if it require to keep the Offender some days, they tie him under a Tree, and set upon him a Watch, by reason they have no Prisons, so that the Offender seeing no way to escape, poysons himself; so by a sudden death, to be freed from the cruelty of a lingering punishment. When any injures another without a cause, they lay him naked upon the earth, and cruelly beat him with a Rope full of knots; which punishment the Judges themselves are subject to, and the greatest Lords and Magistrates, besides the Confiscation of their Estates and Offices.</P>
<P>If the Judges have any difficult business, whereof they can find no proof, they give the suspected person the Bark of a Tree cut small, in Water, and if he can keep that potion without Vomiting, they clear him, otherwise they con∣demn him to death.</P>
<P>These People are for the most part Pagans, they call their chiefest God, <HI>Ma∣ziry,</HI> that is, <HI>The Creator of all things.</HI> They shew great reverence to a certain Maid call'd <HI>Peru,</HI> in whose honor they shut up their Daughters in Cloysters as Recluses.</P>
<P>Moreover,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> they set apart as Sacred, some days of the Moon, and the Birth of their King; but the innumerable number of Erroneous Opinions, darkens all the Splendor of their Belief, which they should have to God the Crea∣tor of Heaven and Earth. But the earnest endeavour of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Je∣suites, hath converted many to Christianity, and brought them to receive Baptism.</P>
<P>In the Year Fifteen hundred and sixty, the King himself, with his Mother, and above three hundred Nobles, and chiefest Lords of the Realm, were Bap∣tiz'd by the hands of the Jesuit, call'd <HI>Gonzales Sylveyra;</HI> but afterwards, at the instigation of some <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> he was slain by the King's command, with the imputation of a Sorcerer; but a little time discovering their ma∣lice, they made satisfaction for his undeserv'd death, with the loss of their own Heads.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The differences about the right place of <HI>Ophir.</HI></NOTE> and seeing both Expositors of holy Scripture, and Geographers understand this Countrey of <HI>Sofala</HI> to be the Gol∣den <HI>Ophir,</HI> to which King <HI>Solomon</HI> sent a Fleet of Ships, Man'd with the Servants of <HI>Hiram</HI> King of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> from <HI>Ezion-geber,</HI> a Haven lying at the Red-Sea; return∣ing
<PB N="606" REF="379"/>again after three years Voyage, loaden with Gold, and Elephants-Teeth. We conceive it not unfit in brief to relate the difference of the ancient Con∣test about this place, hitherto clearly decided, with the Arguments on both sides.</P>
<P><HI>Arias Montanus, Baftellus, Goropius,</HI> and others, are of opinion, that <HI>Ophir</HI> was that part of <HI>America,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Peru;</HI> and divided North, and South <HI>Peru:</HI> therefore they conclude from the word <HI>Parvaim,</HI> in the Hebrew Text, being the Plural Number, and that this Gold was brought from the two <HI>Peru's;</HI> but ma∣ny opposite Arguments refel this Opinion.</P>
<P>First, It is probable, that <HI>Peru</HI> in the time of <HI>Solomon</HI> was not known; nor which is more, the Voyage to <HI>Peru,</HI> over so wide a space of Seas, not possible to be perform'd, especially for want of the use of the Load-stone and Compass.</P>
<P>Secondly, There are in <HI>Peru</HI> no Elephants; so that by consequence, from thence no Ivory, or Elephants Teeth could be brought.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If <HI>Solomon</HI> were to go with a Fleet to <HI>Peru</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> it might have been sent more conveniently out of some Haven of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>-Sea, as be∣ing nearer than out of <HI>Ezien-geber,</HI> at the Red-Sea, to fetch so long a compass, by the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and the whole <HI>Guinee-Coast.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> an ingenious Expounder of the Hebrew, who in the year Four hundred twenty two, in the Nineteenth year of his Age, departed this world under <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Emperor, by the word <HI>Ophir,</HI> understands good or pure Gold; and in his Translation sets down very good Gold, and not Gold of <HI>Pa∣ruaen,</HI> or of any Countrey: but this opinion also is long ago rejected.</P>
<P><HI>Athanasius Kircher,</HI> in his Book of the <HI>Coptick</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> Language, asserts, that <HI>Ophir</HI> is a <HI>Coptick,</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> word; whereby the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> under∣stood the <HI>Indies,</HI> containing the Kingdoms of <HI>Malabar, Scilon,</HI> and the <HI>Golden-Cher∣sonesus,</HI> or the descending Countrey of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> about the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> East∣ward of a Bay, by him call'd, <HI>The Great;</HI> as also <HI>Sumattra,</HI> the <HI>Molucca</HI> Islands, Great, and Little <HI>Java;</HI> and other adjacent Islands full of Gold, whither King <HI>Solomon's</HI> Fleet went with King <HI>Hiram:</HI> The Gold of <HI>Parvaim, Kircherus</HI> judg∣eth was the Gold of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Javim,</HI> that is, of the Islands of <HI>Java;</HI> having read in the Rabbins, these two Islands by the same name.</P>
<P>In setting <HI>Ophir</HI> in <HI>East-Indie,</HI> (as <HI>Kircher</HI> doth) and not in <HI>America,</HI> the chief∣est Geographers agree; as <HI>Ortelius, Volaterranus, Gramas,</HI> and others; yet divers make <HI>Ophir</HI> the same with <HI>Sofala,</HI> because it has much Gold, and Ivory. And if all the main Land (included between the Rivers <HI>Magnice,</HI> and <HI>Quama,</HI> and sub∣mitting unto <HI>Monomotapa</HI>) be all as <HI>Barros, Calles,</HI> or <HI>Sofala,</HI> as well as the rest on the Sea-Coast, it may with great reason be judg'd, that this Countrey can be no other than the Golden <HI>Ophir</HI> of <HI>Solomon;</HI> partly because of the Houses there to be found, near the Gold-Mines; not built after the manner of the Coun∣trey, but seem the work of Foreigners; and partly, because of the Inscriptions in strange and unknown Letters. Moreover, <HI>Thomas Lopez</HI> in his Voyage to the <HI>Indies</HI> affirms, that among the Inhabitants of this Countrey, there remain Books which shew, that <HI>Solomon</HI> every three year had his Gold thence. Besides the <HI>Septuagint</HI> Interpreters have Translated the word <HI>Ophir,</HI> into the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which agrees very near with <HI>Sofala.</HI> And <HI>Josephus</HI> the Jewish Historio∣grapher, calleth it <HI>Indian-Ophir;</HI> adding moreover, that in his time it was call'd <HI>The Gold-Countrey.</HI> A certain Writer, call'd <HI>Eupolemeus,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Eusebius,</HI> calleth it <HI>Ophir Ureten,</HI> and saith, 'tis an Island of the Red-Sea, from whence they used to Fraight Ships to <HI>Melanis,</HI> a City in <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">L'Ambassade de D. Gar∣vas Figuerra en Perse.</NOTE> lie the Islands of <HI>Quirimba,</HI> extending above fifteen miles along the Coast, to the out-lying Point, call'd in <HI>Portuguese, Cabo del Gabo.</HI></P>
<P>They are not all of one equal bigness, nor alike distant from the Main-land, and sever'd one from another by Channels, so small and shallow, that at low-Water they may be Waded over. And although each Island hath its particular name, yet the <HI>Portuguse</HI> call them all <HI>Quirinba.</HI></P>
<P>The Islands were formerly inhabited by the <HI>Arabians;</HI> as may plainly appear by the Ruines of the Houses, and <HI>Mosques,</HI> being built by people less barbarous, than those that have their Residence there at this day, of Lime, Stone, and Tiles, like the Cities of <HI>Quiloa, Monbaza,</HI> and <HI>Melinde.</HI> But since the <HI>Portuguese</HI> began to set forth their Ships to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> the Souldiers and Mariners, out of a natural hatred and antipathy to all <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> thought it not enough to rob them, burn their Houses, and <HI>Mosques,</HI> and to carry them away for Slaves, but with a sweeping Rage, sparing neither Age nor Sex, destroy'd all of the remainder.</P>
<P>These Islands many years since, lay waste and void of people, till some <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> from the Main-Land wafted themselves over thither, and planted them, and so became subject to the Governor of <HI>Mayambique,</HI> about three and thirty miles from thence; from whence every year cometh a Judge to decide Con∣troversies.</P>
<P>The Lord of every Island hath his House built of Stone, and Lime, wherein resides his Wife, Children, and Slaves of both Sexes, as also Friends, and Ser∣vants, whom they hire, to have their assistance against the <HI>Negro's</HI> of the Main-Land, which by their living so near, are ready enough to do them a mischief; And therefore, both themselves and Slaves are Arm'd with Muskets, Pistols, and other Weapons.</P>
<P>Most of these Islands are not above half a mile, or a mile in compass, but very fruitful, full of <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees, Oranges, Figs, Grapes, Herbs, and Pome-Citrons; and excellently accommodated with fresh Water.</P>
<P>They have besides many Oxen, Cows, Goats, and an infinite number of Fowl, among which, Wild-Pigeons, and Turtle-Doves: but Corn, Rice, Drugs, dry'd and confected Fruits, are brought to them from <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Quirinba</HI> is the biggest, and was the first Peopled, yet hath one∣ly twenty five Houses, inhabited by <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Mesties;</HI> they stand not close together, but lie scatter'd, here and there two or three together.</P>
<P>Every one of these little Islands hath their own Governor, which every three year are chang'd. From <HI>Gou</HI> they receive a <HI>Dominican</HI> Priest, who celebrates Mass, and performs all other Sacred Duties; to which end, there stands a Cloy∣ster in the midst of the Houses, whither all those of these Islands come to do their Devotion.</P>
<P>The second of these Islands call'd <HI>Oybo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oybo.</NOTE> is not so big as <HI>Quirinba,</HI> but the Air more temperate and fresher; so that a man may well say, that the whole makes one pleasant Garden, moisten'd and besprinkled in many places, with the best and most wholsomest Waters in the world.</P>
<PB N="609" REF="380"/>
<P>The other Islands have no Road nor Haven, where Ships can come to an An∣chor, because in the deepest Channel at a low Ebb, there is not three Foot water.</P>
<P>Over this Island <HI>Oybo,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Commands, who dwells in a great and handsome House, with Chambers below and above; and behind it a Garden, incompass'd with a Stone-Wall of two Fathom high, with Spiers at the top, so that it may seem in stead of a Bulwark: This, with assistance of his Houshold Family, who are all Arm'd, may be defended against any Incursion of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> from the Main-Land, if they should offer to attempt it; but they live in good Peace one with another, because of their mutual Trade.</P>

<P>There groweth also a certain Plant call'd <HI>Pao,</HI> or Wood of <HI>Antak,</HI> which creeps along the ground, and is very like the Herb <HI>Aristolachia,</HI> or Heart-Wort. The Fruit is long, small, with green Seeds or Grains. The Roots have a strange ver∣tue, in curing a Disease call'd <HI>Antak,</HI> which seizes on the Foreigners, by con∣versing with the <HI>Blacks,</HI> and can be expell'd by no other Medicine.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants make Wine of <HI>Mille,</HI> which they call <HI>Huyembe,</HI> or <HI>Pembe.</HI></P>
<P>Here is no want either of tame or wild Fowl,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Animals.</NOTE> nor of Stags or Harts, wild Hogs, Cows, Oxen, and Elephants; which last are so numerous, that the Inha∣bitants dare not travel without fire, to defend them from their assaults.

<P>Many Silver, Gold, and other Mynes are found in the Countrey.</P>
<P>The People have short Curl'd Hair,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Constitution of the Inhabitants.</NOTE> great Lips, long Visages, and very large Teeth.</P>
<P>They go stark naked, onely a blue little Clout before their Privacies: They Paint ther Bodies with divers Colours, but account it the greatest Ornament, to have streaks of a certain red Earth.

<P>They feed in general upon all sorts of Fruit,

<P>THe Island <HI>Mosambike,</HI> half a Mile from the Main Land, contains about three quarters of a League in length, a quarter in breadth, the whole compass not exceeding a League and a half, with a white Shore. It extendeth South and North, along the Main Land; between which and this Isle and Fort, appears the Bay, serving for a convenient Haven, Land-lockt from all Winds, being very large, and carrying eight or ten Fathom Water: Within a Stones-throw of which the Ships ride at Anchor.</P>
<PB N="611" REF="381"/>
<P>This Island hath the Main Land on the North, and two other uninhabited small Islets on the South, the one nam'd <HI>St. James,</HI> or <HI>Jago,</HI> and the other <HI>St George;</HI> but neither affording any conveniency, not being inhabited, being wholly overgrown with Shrubs and Bushes.</P>
<P>Some place two Cities upon <HI>Mosambike-Isle,</HI> affirming the one to be plenti∣fully peopled by <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and the other with <HI>Blacks;</HI> but <HI>Pyrard</HI> makes the whole so fully inhabited, that it seems but one Town, comprehending within its Circuit a very large and strong Fort, together with five or six Churches, Chappels, and Cloysters.</P>
<P>From the Description of the Navigation to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> made by <HI>Verhoeven,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred and seven, it appears that the City of <HI>Mosambike</HI> is very large, having good Walls, fine Houses, and some Churches and Cloy∣sters: wherewith agrees <HI>Paul van Caerden,</HI> in the Journal of his Voyage to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Garias de Silva Figueora,</HI> in his <HI>Persian</HI> Embassy, comprises in the City an hun∣dred and fifty Houses, but most of them built of Wood, Straw, and <HI>Palm</HI>-Tree Leaves.</P>
<P>For the deciding these different Relations we may suppose, that the first Writer, who placeth two Cities here, mistook two Villages for Cities; and <HI>Linschot</HI> himself mentions the Dwellings severally, making one part of the old Fort, commonly call'd <HI>Fortarez a Velha,</HI> and another of some Houses close by it. Others may have taken a great number of Houses standing close together to be a City; however it is, we may modestly guess, that at the time of these Wri∣ters things were found thus.</P>
<P>There is a Cloyster of <HI>St. Domingo,</HI> with a rich Hospital, said to have been a Castle in former time, built by the Kings of <HI>Portugal,</HI> into which those of that Nation are put, coming sick from Sea.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>St. Anthony, St. Dominick,</HI> and <HI>St. Gabriel</HI>'s Church, all lying without the Fort; they have another, <HI>Nossa Seniora do Balvarte,</HI> built close under the Fort.</P>
<P>The Air being generally more than warm, proves very unwholsom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Air.</NOTE> inso∣much that few live there any while free from dangerous Distempers, which no doubt are much augmented by the want of fresh Water, there being onely one small Spring, of little consequence, in a Thicket of Palm-Trees; so that most of them drink salt Water, mingled with a little of that fresh.</P>
<P>This great Drought sufficiently declares, that the Land proves barren,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unfruitfulness of the Soyl.</NOTE> and unfit to produce any thing: Yet provident Nature hath recompenced the want of all other Provision with Coco-Nuts, Oranges, Citrons, <HI>Ananassed</HI>-Figs, and other <HI>Indian</HI>-Fruits, but these onely in manured and well cultivated Gar∣dens.</P>
<P>They have neither Wheat nor Rice growing, but all brought from the Main Land, or from <HI>Goa</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> so also Raisins or Grapes, and <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>-Wines, with several other Necessaries both for benefit and sustenance; so that it is much dearer living here than in any other Place possessed by the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> in this Coast.</P>
<P>Here breed great Herds of Oxen, Cows, Sheep,

<P>There are also many excellent Birds, with black Feathers, and black Flesh, either boyl'd or raw, yet accounted no unwholsom Food.</P>
<P>The Haven swarms with Fishes, which the Inhabitants call <HI>Marraxos,</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese, Tintoreas;</HI> they are very ravenous after Man's-flesh, for so soon as they see a Man fall into the Water by chance, or go to swim, they will im∣mediately catch and devour him.</P>

<P>The City being of the same Name,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Membaza.</HI></NOTE> built after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, bears a considerable bulk, being situate on a high Rock. The extent of the whole Do∣minion not very big, bordering on one side at the City of <HI>Orgaba,</HI> seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Onchit,</HI> which poures her Waters into the <HI>Nyle</HI> by the Mountain <HI>Amara,</HI> where the Kingdom of <HI>Melinde</HI> begins.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> had formerly thrown up a Fortification at the Shore of this Ri∣ver, so that none could come into the City but through it, being environ'd with a Wall, planted with Guns to defend it against the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who in the Year Fifteen hundred, under the Command of <HI>Vasques de Gamma</HI> took this Fort, with all the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallies.</P>
<P>At the same time the City was also conquer'd by a People call'd <HI>Imbires,</HI> li∣ving not far from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> by the aid of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> after a long Siege, into which five hundred of them entring by Storm, pull'd down the Walls, Churches, and a greatvaulted Castle, to the ground, and burn'd all the Ships in the Haven. The King of <HI>Mombaza</HI> himself, with all his Courtiers and great Officers, fell into the hands of these <HI>Imbires,</HI> which not onely put them to death, but eat them up.</P>
<P>The City was once before, in the Year Fifteen hundred and five, ruin'd by one <HI>Francois Almede;</HI> and some years afterwards again re-built by the King of <HI>Mombaza:</HI> but it long held not up its head, being again assaulted, taken, and plunder'd by another <HI>Portuguese,</HI> call'd <HI>Nunno de Acunha,</HI> who endeavouring to settle, were forced to leave their Conquest and retire to the fore-mention'd Fort, but were also at last dispossessed thereof by the same King, in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty one.</P>
<P>The temperature of the Air gives no cause of complaint to such as dwell there,

He is said to be so arrogant and self-conceited, that at the falling of Rain against his pleasure, or excessive Heat, he breaks out into several exclamations against Heaven, and out of madness draws his Bowe against the Sun. In brief, he calls himself the Emperor of all the World, and imagines that he shall overcome the whole Earth. He keeps commonly an Army of fourscore thousand Men in the Field, and in their March observes this Order: First he commands to go before him many Droves of Cattel; next several persons carry Fire, whereby he intends to declare, that all those whom he Conquers, must expect nothing else but to be Roasted and Eaten: All the Towns and Villages he travels through of the Enemies, he ruines, and without distinguishing of Men from Beasts, kills all he finds, so that all stand in great fear of him, and betake themselves to flight when they hear of his approach.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Mombaza</HI> and all his Subjects were formerly Idolaters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religions</NOTE> but at present embrace <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Superstition, introduced by their last King, about the Year Sixteen hundred thirty one.

<P>THe Kingdom of <HI>Melinde</HI> lying more to the North than that of <HI>Mom∣baza,</HI> hath received its Name from the chief City,

<P>The chief City <HI>Melinde,</HI> situate in a pleasant Plain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief City.</NOTE> and surrounded with se∣veral Gardens, contains many Houses, very neatly built of hew'n Stone, with handsom Rooms, and Painted Cielings.

<P>The Haven lieth a little distant from the City, by reason of sundry Rocks, which makes the Landing-place very dangerous.</P>
<P>The Countrey is fat and fruitful, and yields all necessary Provisions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> except Bread, in stead of which the Inhabitants use the Root <HI>Potatesen.</HI> Some Rice and Barley grows there, but inconsiderable; nor have they any Wheat and Rye, but what is brought from <HI>Kambaye.</HI> There are several sorts of Fruits-Trees; and above all, very excellent and well tasted Melons, in the Countrey Lan∣guage call'd <HI>Dormous,</HI> which the Inhabitants eat in the Summer time as a plea∣sant cooler.</P>
<P>There is all sorts of Venison, and Fowl, great and small Cattel,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> chiefly Sheep, much bigger than those in <HI>Europe,</HI> with Tails of five and twenty, and
<PB N="616" REF="384"/>thirty Pound weight: Hens, Geese, and all sorts of Flesh may be had here in great abundance.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are some black,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> and some brown, with Curl'd Hair: but those which live by the River <HI>Quilmanzi</HI> are white; as also most of the Women of <HI>Melinde.</HI></P>
<P>The Women go very nobly apparell'd in Silks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apparel.</NOTE> and wear Gold and Silver Chains, with a Cloth before their Faces when they go abroad. The Men go naked down to their Wastes, but from thence wear Cotton or Silk Coats, with a Linnen or Cotton <HI>Turbant</HI> on their Heads.</P>
<P>The principal Commodities for Trade, are Gold, Ivory, Copper, Quicksil∣ver, and Wax, which the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> and <HI>Cambayan</HI> Merchants barter for Clothes and Stuffs.</P>
<P>For Arms they use Scimiters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> Shields, Bowes and Arrows: Some have repu∣ted them the valiantest of all <HI>Africa;</HI> yet those of <HI>Mombaza</HI> have often put them into fear, and would have treated them very badly, had they not obtain'd the <HI>Portuguese</HI> assistance.</P>
<P>The Subjects honour their King very highly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honor shown to the King.</NOTE> carrying him on their Shoul∣ders, and at his going out in the Streets burning sweet Perfumes before him; which also they use to do before all other Princes and Lords that come to visit them.</P>
<P>The King takes cognisance in Person of all Matters in debate,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of execu∣ting Justice.</NOTE> although he hath appointed Officers and Judges to officiate in the administration of Justice: And if any complain of another person to the King, he must be sure to give a good account of the Matter, or else he runs in danger of losing his Head: how∣ever, upon the Complaint he immediately sends for the person: if the Com∣plainant be a great Lord, then being come, at the Palace he winds his Horn, to acquaint the Servants of his coming before the King: If upon examination he finds both have offended, then the least Offender is sent to the Lords of the Ju∣stice, who punish him corporally by beating with Cudgels; but the greatest he condemns in a pecuniary mulct. But if onely one great Lord hath committed any offence, being brought before the King in his Chamber, he is stripped stark naked, and laid upon the Ground, where, upon his humble submission and begging of pardon, he receives some blows with a Wand from the King's own Hand, more or less, according to the bigness of the Crime: After which he takes up his Clothes, kisseth the King's Feet, and in all humility thanks him for the favor receiv'd: then he attends the King into his Hall, who forgives him in the presence of all the Court, with a Command to do Justice, and af∣terwards goes out of the City in publick with honorable attendance, and re∣turns into his Countrey with as great satisfaction, as if he had received some great Present.</P>
<P>When the King travels abroad to view his Concerns, he rides upon a Horse richly furnished, and going out of the Palace, treads over a new-kill'd Deer; whereupon all the People give a loud shout: and at the same time the Priests inspect the Intrails, to know whether his Progress will be prosperous or not.</P>
<P>When he makes his entrance into any City, then all the handsomest Ladies and Maids meet him, some singing his praise, others carrying and burning Perfumes before him, others playing with small Sticks on a Bason, and every one striving to recreate and please him.</P>
<P>When any Native Prince sends an Agent to Treat about some weighty Matters, they also kill a Deer, which the King steps over thrice, the Soothsayer
<PB N="617" REF="384"/>in the interim viewing the Inwards, to enquire of the effect that may be pro∣duced thereby.</P>
<P>Some report the Inhabitants of the City <HI>Melinde</HI> for <HI>Heathens,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> others for <HI>Ma∣humetans;</HI> but <HI>Linschot</HI> says they are of both sorts, among which are many <HI>Christians.</HI></P>

<P>The Inhabitants as far as <HI>Barbara</HI> are Olivaster-colour'd;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> but from thence more to the North, about <HI>Zeila</HI> and <HI>Barrazan,</HI> they grow much blacker; natu∣rally quarrelsom, and apt to make Wars upon any trivial occasion.</P>
<P>They go cover'd from their Navel to their Knees with Cotton; but the upper part of their Bodies remain naked: onely Persons of Quality wear Coats, which in <HI>Arabick</HI> they call <HI>Bernuz.</HI></P>
<P>This Dominion possesses much Gold and Ivory, besides such a liberal Provi∣sion of Victuals, that they feed their Neighbors of several other Countreys. They vend also Clothes, Myrrhe, Pepper, and Slaves.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Cambaya</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> carry to <HI>Barbara</HI> all sorts of Cloth, and Beads which they call <HI>Maramugos,</HI> Raisins, Dates, and many other things, which they exchange for Gold, Elephants-Teeth, and Slaves: And those of <HI>Quiloa, Melinde, Brava, Magadoxo,</HI> and <HI>Mombaza,</HI> barter these Commodities for <HI>Arabian</HI>-Horse.</P>
<P>The Natives are generally very stout, but badly Arm'd,

<HEAD>The Island of Barbora.</HEAD>
<P>OVer against the City <HI>Barbora,</HI> in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> close by the Shore, lieth an Island of the same Name, exceedingly fruitful, and well stored with Cattel.</P>

<HEAD>The Island of Socotora.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Socotora,</HI> or <HI>Sacotora,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Sicuthora,</HI> discover'd by <HI>Fernando Bereyra,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Barros. Ramusse.</NOTE> is by some taken for the <HI>Dioscorides</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> and by others for <HI>Curia Muria;</HI> though somewhat improperly, because that Isle lies over against the Main Coast of <HI>Arabia.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Situation.</NOTE> This hath its Situ∣ation in twelve Degrees and fifty Minutes North Latitude, fifteen Miles Southward from the <HI>Cape of Guardafuy,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Cape Aromata,</HI> and almost as far from the Mouth of the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Now the most Geographers include this Island of <HI>Socotora</HI> under <HI>Africa,</HI> for its nearness to that Coast; yet some, and those of <HI>Nubia,</HI> have reckon'd it among the Islands of <HI>Arabia Felix.</HI></P>
<P>And as they cannot agree to which it belongs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigness.</NOTE> so they differ no less in its Magnitude; some making it swell to sixty <HI>Spanish,</HI> while others straiten it to scarce fifteen <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles: But it seems the first comes nearer to the truth, because the latter Discoverers make it fifteen Miles long, and ten Miles broad at the narrowest; and <HI>Pirard</HI> reckons it fifteen <HI>French</HI> Miles in circumference.</P>
<P>The whole Island stands encompassed with exceeding high Rocks, which inclose therein divers fertile Valleys. On all sides Ships may find good An∣chorage, besides the many convenient Bays and Creeks, affording safe Roads: But it boasts two chief Havens, the one call'd <HI>Cora,</HI> and the other <HI>Benin.</HI></P>
<P>Here is but onely one City, nam'd <HI>Sicuthora,</HI> seated at the foot of the <HI>Cape Treta,</HI> looking to the South, where the <HI>Xeque,</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Governor makes his aboad. Others make <HI>Tamary</HI> the Chief Place, and the usual Dwelling of the <HI>Bassa.</HI> A third sort place here three Towns or Villages, inhabited by <HI>Arabians:</HI> But a fourth affirm, That the Natives have neither Towns, Villages, nor Hou∣ses; but abide in Holes or Caves in the Rocks.</P>
<P>They have many Temples or Churches,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Churche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Moquamos;</HI> but ve∣ry small, and so low, that without stooping none can come into the same. Every Church hath three Doors, and one Altar, on which stands a Cross, with two Sticks, made in form of Flower-de-luces.</P>
<P>The Situation of the Island so near the Line causes the Air not onely to be exceeding hot,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Air.</NOTE> but also unhealthy. And by reason of this excessive Heat, they have great want of Water: Yet notwithstanding there falls a great Mist in the Nights from the high stony Cliffs, to the great cooling and refreshing of the parched Earth: And although a few Rivers may be found, yet they lie at such
<PB N="623" REF="387"/>distances from the common Passages, and remain so difficult to be found, that many Travellers die for thirst; onely at the Sea side are Trenches, out of which the <HI>Arabians</HI> drink. And the Mountains, by reason of their excessive height, have their tops continually cover'd with Snow, and cloudy with Mists and Fogs.</P>
<P>The Soil, for want of Moisture, proves very barren,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitution of the Soil.</NOTE> producing nothing (as some write) but Dates; for indeed none take care to Sowe any Corn, or Plant Fruits. On the contrary,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> in the Woods and Mountains breed many Bucks, Goats, Cows, Hogs, Catamountains, Wild Asses, Horses, Camelions, Wild Hens, or Pheasants, and Turtle-Doves.</P>
<P>But that which above all things makes this Island famous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aloes Sicotrina.</NOTE> is the Plant from which the <HI>Aloes Sicotrina</HI> cometh, and also for the great abundance of <HI>Dragons Blood</HI> brought thence, being no other than a Gum distilling from a Tree; the <HI>Indians</HI> call it <HI>Ber,</HI> and bruise it with an Iron in the growing Bark at a set time of the Year. The Sea-shore also produces much Ambergreece.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Island are <HI>Arabians,</HI> or Native <HI>Sicotrians,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Inhabitants.</NOTE> which last the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Beduins,</HI> and are divided into two Generations: The one,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature.</NOTE> ha∣ving <HI>Beduinsche</HI> Mothers, and <HI>Arabian Negro</HI> Fathers, keep at the Sea side, are black of Colour, curl'd Hair, tall of Stature, but very ill-favour'd: The others are unmix'd <HI>Beduins,</HI> and live within the Countrey, being whiter than Native <HI>Iudians.</HI> Some of them seem to have been born in <HI>Europe,</HI> by the tallness of their Statures, handsom Bodies, soundness of Constitution, and the Air of the Face; onely differing herein, that they let their Hair grow without cutting, which they suffer either to hang over their Necks and Shoulders, or else tie up or braid the same together behind. They are inconstant, mistrustful,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitution.</NOTE> and cow∣ardly; insomuch that a handful of <HI>Arabians</HI> will awe vast Multitudes of them. They have a great fear of all other people, which makes them shun converse with Foreigners, and are above measure lazy and idle, concerning themselves in nothing but Fishing, and feeding their Cattel.</P>
<P>Their common Food is Milk, Butter, Dates, and Flesh;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> but chiefly Milk boyl'd with Herbs, and serves them both for Diet and Physick. In stead of Rie, or Wheaten Bread, they use Rice, brought to them from other Places, and for want of that, eat Cakes made of Dates.</P>
<P>They wear certain Clothes by them call'd <HI>Cambolins,</HI> made of Bucks Hair,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apparel.</NOTE> six Spans long and two broad, from their Girdle to their Knees, and over that another greater black and white Cloth, in form like a Cloke, which they wrap about from their Shoulders to their Knees, and never pull it off: <HI>Barbosa,</HI> on the contrary, writeth, That they go stark naked, onely with a Clout or Skin of a Beast before their Privacies, which <HI>Corsalis</HI> also affirms. Their Heads are bare, though <HI>Thevet</HI> saith they wear Shashes, as the <HI>Abyssine</HI> Christians. The Women wear the same <HI>Cambolins,</HI> and with it, from their Middle to their Feet, another great Mantle, without any thing on their Heads. These, as we men∣tion'd before, live in Holes and Caves, as the ancient <HI>Troglodites</HI> on the opposite Coast of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and sleep on the Ground, upon Buck-skins; and their manner of Salutation consists in the kissing one anothers Shoulders.</P>
<P>There are no Artists nor Handicrafts found amongst them; onely every one knows how to Weave the foremention'd <HI>Cambolins,</HI> or Hair-Clothes. They are ignorant and brutish beyond comparison; and as they know no better, so they hate to learn, and use no other Arithmetick than what they notch on Sticks.</P>
<P>The Men keep as many Women as they can maintain (though <HI>Osarius,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> upon a wrong information, scarcely allows one Woman to a Man) and part from
<PB N="624" REF="388"/>them when they think meet. When they have any Children, they may charge others with them, whom they please; and this nominated Father must receive and feed them as his own, and give them part of his Goods, as to his other Children. The Children thus given away, they call <HI>Children of Smoke;</HI> because when the Men and the Women conclude to dispose of a Child, they make a Fire at the Door of the House with green Wood, and whilst it begins to smoke, the Man runs out, crying with a loud voice, That the Child shall be given to such a Man, whose Name they declare; and so the Father and Mother carry it to him, and he takes care for it, as we mention'd before.</P>
<P>The Names of the <HI>Beduin</HI>-Men are,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The names of the men.</NOTE> <HI>Lakaa, Sumaa, Xembe, Terremo, Xamaxana, Surrakaa,</HI> and other such like; so that <HI>John de Barras</HI> seems to have been mis∣inform'd, who says, <HI>They take the Names of</HI> St. Thomas, <HI>and other Apostles:</HI> But all the Women are call'd <HI>Maria;</HI> not out of Honor or Respect to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> but because in their common Language <HI>Mary</HI> signifies <HI>A Woman.</HI></P>
<P>They never stay to wait for the dying of their sick Friends;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Beduins</HI> kill their sick.</NOTE> but when they guess them past recovery, they kill them: For they say, <HI>That between being quite dead, and beginning to die, is no difference.</HI> When the sick Persons see their Ends approach, they call their Children and nearest Relations, giving them many Counsels and Advices, among which the three following are most usual. First, <HI>That they should receive or embrace no other Doctrine or Religion, than those of their Forefathers.</HI> The second, <HI>That they would not make themselves familiar, or have to do with any one of another Countrey.</HI> The third, <HI>That they would take revenge of some Ene∣mies, which they name:</HI> Which last proves many times the occasion of divers Murders. When any Person is pursu'd by another that intends to kill him, and he cannot escape, he takes and drinks the white Juyce of a Tree growing in this Island, being the strongest Poyson that can be found, and which they always carry about them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> of this Island,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> according to the Relation of <HI>Pyrard,</HI> Trade to <HI>Goa, Arabia,</HI> and other Places, where they sell their Dates and Rice, brought to them out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> very curious Mats made of Date-tree Leaves, and great abundance of Myrrhe; and from thence the <HI>European</HI> Merchants bring <HI>Aloes Sicotrina,</HI> and <HI>Dragons Blood,</HI> vulgarly known among Apothecaries by the name of <HI>Sanguis Draconis.</HI></P>
<P>Here are few Fortifications;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength.</NOTE> onely the King of <HI>Kaxem</HI> or <HI>Fartas</HI> erected a Fort or Bulwark, by the Village <HI>Tamara,</HI> with another of Stone on the Sea∣shore, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Conquer'd under the Command of one <HI>Trestan de Cunha,</HI> in the year Fifteen hundred six, or seven; who left it to the Charge of <HI>Alphonso Norogue,</HI> with a strong Garrison of <HI>Portuguese</HI> Soldiers: But the Island∣ers, instigated by the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> to whom they were before bound in Marria∣ges, broke their Promise made to the King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> so that King <HI>Emanuel</HI> discerning the Nature of the People, and how the defending of this Fort cost more than it was worth, commanded the same to be demolished.</P>
<P>Their Arms are broad Hangers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> with great Hilts: At their Girdle they wear also a Knife, of about three fingers broad, and sharp. The Hilts of the Hang∣ers are cover'd with Silver or Copper, or wound about with Wyre very neatly. Some carry Shields, and ordinary Guns, in the use whereof they are very ex∣pert.</P>
<P>The proper Language of these <HI>Beduins</HI> is so barbarous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> as not to be under∣stood by others than themselves; but most of them speak <HI>Arabick,</HI> by daily Conversation with the <HI>Arabians.</HI></P>
<PB N="625" REF="388"/>
<P>The Government of this Island, according to <HI>Pyrard,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> belongs to a peculiar <HI>Xeque,</HI> sent thither by the <HI>Xerif</HI> of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and hath his aboad in <HI>Tamary.</HI> For∣merly the <HI>Turk</HI> possess'd this whole Isle, by Conquest thereof in the year Fif∣teen hundred thirty eight, at which time he made himself also Master of <HI>Aden.</HI> But the King of <HI>Kaxem,</HI> or <HI>Kajem,</HI> which some take to be the same with the King of <HI>Fartas,</HI> regain'd and held it, till the <HI>Xerif</HI> of <HI>Arabia</HI> won it from him, who sends thither a <HI>Xeque</HI> to Rule as his Substitute.</P>
<P>For the deciding of Differences, determining of Criminal Causes, and ma∣naging Affairs of State, Judges, which they call <HI>Caciz,</HI> or <HI>Hodomas,</HI> are appoint∣ed, from whom there is no Appeal. If any one has stoll'n a Buck or a Goat, out of necessity, or for meer hunger, he may, if he perceives the Owner of the Beast pursues him, fly to a Temple, by which he is clear'd; If coming to the Temple, and making a noise, another cometh to receive him, there may nothing further of prejudice be offer'd; but if none cometh to him, then they may pull him out, and cut off his Hand, alledging, <HI>That the Temple would not serve him for his defence, because none would come to receive him.</HI></P>
<P>There are some that to this time hold an opinion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> That the Islanders of <HI>So∣cotora</HI> call themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> and particularly shew great Honor to St. <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> from whom they boast to have received the <HI>Christian Faith;</HI> and have been induced to believe the same, by seeing the Cross upon their Altars, and the Ob∣servations and Fastings of their <HI>Caciz,</HI> and other Marks of Christianity: But the contrary was afterwards found; for certain it is, That they have no know∣ledge of <HI>Christ,</HI> or of Matters concerning the Christian Religion, except their shewing great Honour to the Cross, and because they have it upon Altars in the Church; but being ask'd a Reason thereof, they answer, <HI>That it was taught them by Tradition from their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>They worship the Moon, because they hold her to be the Mother and Cause of all things; and therefore in great Droughts they set one among them in a certain place, and make a Circle round about him, out of which he must not stir, upon pain of death, but there must continue ten days worshipping the Moon; within which time if it doth not Rain, they cut off his Hand. Be∣fore the beginning of <HI>Lent,</HI> all the most Eminent assemble, and offer Sacrifice to the Moon, of an hundred Goats and Kids Heads. They observe <HI>Lent</HI> like the <HI>Christians;</HI> but they begin it with the New Moon in <HI>April,</HI> and keep the So∣lemnity sixty days; during which time they eat no Milk, Butter, Flesh, nor Fish, but onely Herbs and Dates, or Rice and Honey, which they buy in the Cities of the <HI>Arabians.</HI> They are so zealous Observers of this Fast, that if they find any to have broken it, for the first time they cut off two Fingers of his Right-hand; the second time, the whole Hand; and the third time, the Arm.</P>
<P>Every Temple, of which there are many, hath a <HI>Caciz,</HI> call'd by them <HI>Hoda∣mo,</HI> that is, a Governor or Judge in Church-matters; but holds the Office but one Year, which he enters upon by receiving a Staff, the Badge of his Authori∣ty, and wearing always a Cross of a Span and half long about him, which he may not part with upon pain of the loss of his Hand. In the Temples, whereinto at the Rising and Setting of the Moon they enter, they use a Stick of two or three Spans long, upon which with another Stick they give certain Strokes, thrice in the Day, and thrice in the Night; held by them for a Work of great Holiness: Afterwards they go in Procession three times round about the Church-yard, turning thrice after every Circuit; then they take an Iron Pan, made in form of a plain deep Scale, hanging upon three Chains,
<PB N="626" REF="389"/>into which they put Splinters of sweet Wood, and hold the Bason over the Fire: then they first perfume the Altar thrice, afterwards the Temple Doors, and say with a loud voice some Prayers in the Temple, and in the Church-yard, re∣questing of the Moon to do good to them onely, and no other People: At the performance of this Solemnity, the <HI>Hodamo</HI> holdeth upon the Altar a lighted Candle made of Butter (for they have none of Wax or Tallow;) and there∣fore they have in their Temples Dishes of Butter, wherewith they also every day anoint the Cross and other Sticks lying upon the Altar. They go upon a certain day of the year, with the greatest Cross, in Procession round about the Temple, and cause it to be carry'd by one chosen out of the whole Assembly, whose Fingers after the ending of the Procession they chop off, and present him with a little Stick, with certain marks upon it, for a token, that he should be prejudic'd by no body; whereupon thenceforth he is held in much greater ho∣nor than others.</P>
<P>They follow in many Churches the Ceremonies and Customs of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> because they were for a long time Govern'd by Ecclesiastical Rulers which came from <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P>They have no set-Day of the Week to go into their Temples, but assemble on the Procession-days, or when any new occasion calls them.</P>
<P>They are Circumcis'd like the <HI>Moors;</HI> and if they know any one that is not Cir∣cumcis'd, they cut off his Fingers; for no Uncircumcis'd may enter into their Temples: yea, the very Women themselves clap their hands at their Husbands, if they be not Circumcis'd. They bear a great hatred against all <HI>Christians;</HI> ne∣vertheless some are of opinion, that they have suck'd in much of the Heresie of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and that formerly many were Converted by <HI>Francis Xavier.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Observations of Sir <HI>Thomas Roe,</HI> Ambassador from the King of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Persia,</HI> there were in the Year Sixteen hundred and fifteen, upon this Island four sorts of People, that is, <HI>Arabians,</HI> not Natives, but Shipt over thither, together with many others, by order of the King of <HI>Kaxem,</HI> when they subdu'd it. These never appear before the <HI>Sultan</HI> without kissing his Hand. The second sort are a kind of Slaves, who labor continually in his service, and prepare and dress the Aloes. The third are <HI>Beduins,</HI> the most antient Inhabi∣tants, against whom a long time the King of <HI>Socotora</HI> made War. They live in great numbers upon the Mountains, and are at this day left in Peace, upon pro∣mise to shew their Obedience, and let their Children be instructed in the Do∣ctrine of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth being indeed the right Proprietors of the Countrey, are a gross Body'd and miserable People, which have no constant abode; in the night lying in the Woods, and going always stark naked: they live by Roots, hold no con∣verse with others, and lead a life almost like Beasts.</P>

<P>THe Modern Geographers, as <HI>Maginus</HI> and others, name the Countrey or Space of Land, lying between the <HI>Nile</HI> and the Red-Sea, properly <HI>New Arabia;</HI> but the Inhabitants, according to <HI>Castaldus,</HI> call it <HI>Sirfi.</HI> The Antients nam'd it <HI>Trogloditica,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy, The Countrey of the Arabians and Egy∣ptians.</HI> The Inhabitants were by the <HI>Grecians</HI> call'd <HI>Ichthiophagi,</HI> that is, <HI>Fish-eaters;</HI>

<P>In the bounding of this Countrey great diversity arises amongst Geographers: <HI>Ptolomy</HI> extends <HI>Trogloditick Arabia,</HI> from the City <HI>Suez,</HI> by the Red-Sea, three; or according to <HI>Peter de la Valla,</HI> scarce a days Journey and a half from <HI>Cairo</HI> to <HI>Mount Elephas,</HI> at this day call'd <HI>Felte:</HI> so that he compriseth under it the Sea-Coast of the Kingdoms of <HI>Barnagas</HI> and <HI>Adel.</HI> Some extend the Limits in the South, to the Territory of <HI>Brava,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Magadoxo,</HI> and the River <HI>Quilanzi,</HI> yet make it begin at the forenam'd <HI>Suez;</HI> but a third sort narrow it to the <HI>Cape of Guardafuy,</HI> and some to the Island <HI>Mazua</HI> in the Red-Sea.</P>
<P>The chiefest Places, as you go from North to South, near <HI>Suez,</HI> according to <HI>Maginus,</HI> are these (though <HI>Belloon</HI> gives them to the <HI>Nether-Egypt:</HI>) The Haven and Point of <HI>Pharos,</HI> where they say the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> went over the Red-Sea on dry ground; the <HI>Seven Wells,</HI> call'd <HI>Sette Pozzi</HI> in <HI>Italian;</HI> the Haven of <HI>Alkosser,</HI> or <HI>Chessir.

<P><HI>THevet</HI> calls this Island <HI>Dalaca;</HI> others, <HI>Dalaccia, Delaqua, Delalaca, Dala∣qualacari,</HI> and <HI>Daleck:</HI> It lies below <HI>Mazua,</HI> a little more Southerly; but by <HI>Sanutus</HI> set opposite to <HI>Mazua;</HI> five miles from the Main Land of the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> in sixteen Degrees North-Latitude, saith <HI>Andrew Corsali;</HI> but ac∣cording to <HI>Huez,</HI> in fourteen Degrees and twenty Minutes. <HI>Marmol</HI> placeth it it eighteen Miles from <HI>Mazua,</HI> and gives it one City, of the same Name with the Island. <HI>Sanutus</HI> extends it in compass to eighty <HI>Italian</HI> miles, four reckon'd to one of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> but <HI>Corsali</HI> accounts it twenty <HI>French</HI> miles.</P>
<P>This Island boasts a healthy Air, and plenty of fresh Water, which hap∣pening very seldom in these Countreys, invites many People thither. 'Tis high and barren, but pleasant, for both the Hills and Dales have lovely Groves of Trees, yielding a delightful shadow, but no Fruit, contrary to <HI>Thevet,</HI> who makes this Island abound with Oranges and Lemons; adding moreover, that in <HI>March</HI> the whole Air is perfum'd with a most delicious scent. There grows little Corn or Grain, but what they have (as also Honey, Barley, and Butter) they fetch from the <HI>Abyssines;</HI> yet they have very fair Pastures, and full of Grass, which feed Cows, Camels, and many Goats.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants, an expert and Warlike People, are either black or tawny of Colour, sowre of Countenance, treacherous and inveterate Enemies of the <HI>Turks,</HI> against whom they hold Wars continually. They speak distinctly, bear no regard to foreign Merchants; from whom, notwithstanding their most serious engagements, they steal whatever they can meet with.</P>
<P>Their Language is more difficult and obscure than the <HI>Turkish, Persian,</HI> or <HI>Indian;</HI> but their Habit, if so we may call it, differs not from the last before∣mention'd.</P>
<P>Their Government seems Monarchical,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> one Person giving the Rule both to this and the adjacent Islands.</P>
<PB N="629" REF="390"/>
<P>Their Religion is as great a mixture as their People,

<HEAD>The Island of Bebel-Mandel.</HEAD>
<P>PAssing from North to South you arrive at an Island now known by the Name of <HI>Bebel-Mandel,</HI> but antiently call'd <HI>The Island of Diodorus,</HI> situate in the midst of the Red-Sea, which it divides into two Channels, not above a mile from the Main Land of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the like distance from <HI>Abyssinia</HI> towards the <HI>Cape of Zeila;</HI> so that the King of <HI>Egypt</HI> formerly shut up this Passage on his side, with an Iron Chain drawn from one to the other. <HI>Pigafet</HI> will have one of the Channels towards the West-side to be five and twenty <HI>Italian</HI> miles, or five <HI>Dutch</HI> miles wide, with a good Bottom, and the com∣mon Passage for great Ships; but the other scarce a large <HI>Dutch</HI> mile wide, full of Rocks, Shelves, and Banks of Sand. It lieth in twelve Degrees and fifty Minutes North-Latitude. <HI>Thevet</HI> calls it <HI>Muim,</HI> and makes it two <HI>French</HI> miles in compass, having some few Trees, but otherwise wholly barren. For∣merly the <HI>Abyssines</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> of <HI>Aden</HI> made great Wars against the Possessors thereof, by which it became subject sometimes to the <HI>Christians,</HI> and then to the <HI>Moors,</HI> till at last the <HI>Portuguese</HI> utterly laid it waste, and so left it without hope of re-peopling.</P>
<P>The Island <HI>Suachem,</HI> or <HI>Suaquem,</HI> by <HI>Marmol</HI> call'd <HI>Suaquum,</HI> standing, accord∣ing to <HI>Thevet,</HI> East and West, contains fifteen or sixteen <HI>French</HI> miles in com∣pass; but <HI>Rosaccio</HI> makes it much less, and divides it almost from the City of the same Name, beautifi'd with many fair built Houses. <HI>Maginus</HI> supposeth the Haven of this Place to be the <HI>Sebastian Mouth</HI> mention'd by <HI>Ptolomy.</HI></P>
<P>Over against <HI>Adel</HI> in the Red-Sea, lieth the Island <HI>Barbora,</HI> already men∣tion'd.</P>
<P>About <HI>Suez</HI> inhabit two sorts of <HI>Christians,</HI> one Circumcised, nam'd <HI>Jacobites;</HI> the other Uncircumcised, commonly call'd <HI>Melaquiters.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of these Islands, and the Places on the Coast of the Red-Sea, Trade with the <HI>Arabians</HI> over against it.</P>
<P><HI>Sanutus</HI> saith, that in the Haven of <HI>Chessir</HI> they have many Huts made with Mats, wherein they stow the Wares carry'd from <HI>Cairo</HI> to <HI>Mecha.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Ziden</HI> convey to <HI>Suez</HI> all sorts of Spicery, Drugs, precious Ambergreece, which they bring from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and transport from thence upon Camels to <HI>Cairo.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner the Merchants bring from <HI>Cambaya</HI> into <HI>Asia,</HI> and from all <HI>Arabia</HI> to <HI>Barbora,</HI> all sorts of Clothes, Beads, or <HI>Motamugo's,</HI> Elephants-Teeth, and other Commodities.</P>
<P>The Red-Sea, by the <HI>Moors</HI> call'd <HI>Bahar Queizum;</HI> by others, <HI>The Arabian Bay,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Red-Sea. <HI>Gaspar. Sam. Bernar∣dino.</HI></NOTE> and Streights of Mecha,</HI> the Burial-place of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> lieth between the Coast of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and <HI>Abyssine</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> so that it parts <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>At the entrance of this Sea lie two Harbors, the one call'd <HI>Guardafuy;</HI> and the other, <HI>Fartague:</HI> The breadth between them is sixty Leagues or <HI>Spanish</HI> Miles,
<PB N="630" REF="391"/>and the length five hundred; that is, an hundred to the Straights of <HI>Bebel-Mandel,</HI> and four hundred from thence to <HI>Suez,</HI> where it ends.</P>
<P><HI>Geminiano</HI> a Jesuit averr'd, that in former times the Red-Sea overflow'd all <HI>Egypt,</HI> and by its Water took away the colour from the green springing Soyl; but after the Water began to fall away and lessen, it remain'd at length with so little moisture, that the Sun-beams, which shine down in that place with very great power, make a reflexion of the red Sand from the bottom, which seem∣ing to give a tincture to the Water from its ruddiness, gave the occasion of de∣nominating it the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> though <HI>Pliny</HI> will have it from a King, who Reigned here, and in <HI>Greek</HI> was call'd <HI>Erithreos,</HI> that is, <HI>Red.</HI> To this Opinion inclin'd <HI>Pomponius Mela, Aristotle,</HI> and others: But <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> is of a contrary Judg∣ment, maintaining, that this Sea was call'd the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who were drown'd in it when they pursu'd the <HI>Israelites,</HI> in the Year after the Crea∣tion, Two thousand three hundred fifty and four, according to the computa∣tion of <HI>Michael Zapuler,</HI> in his Description of the <HI>Holy Land. Johannes de Castro,</HI> formerly Vice-Roy to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> affirms, that the red colour of this Sea, ariseth from the great quantity of Corral growing at the bottom. Others, that the Rivers which pour into this in the midst of Winter, having flow'd through Countreys of a red colour'd Earth, make the Water seem red, and consequently gave it the Name. Certain it is, that all the Wa∣ter is like that in the great Sea, and saltish.</P>
<P>In this Sea befell the Miracle which the holy Scriptures mention, when <HI>Moses</HI> with his Rod commanded a Way for the passage of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> to the number of six hundred thousand Men, (Women and Children not reckon'd:) and wherein <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> in pursuit of them, as he supposed flying, twelve thou∣sand Foot-Soldiers, and fifty thousand Horsemen, were swallow'd.</P>
<P>In this Sea are many strange and remarkable things, as Trees growing, Branches of Corral, Mushroms, Meremaids, flying Fishes, and other wondrous Creatures. But how great diligence soever they have used, none could ever take any of them, although common, and at all times seen along the Coast; for the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believe, that they and theirs, by the killing such a Creature, should die within a year, as they say, they have found by experience. And out of that conceit, when in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty one, one was taken alive in the <HI>Nyle,</HI> by the City <HI>Rosetta,</HI> the <HI>Bey</HI> or Governor of the City, com∣manded it presently to be put into the Water again, though a <HI>Venetian</HI> had bought it for five and twenty <HI>Piasters,</HI> and rather than incur the hazard, re∣turn'd him his Money.</P>
<P><HI>Gaspar de San Bernardino,</HI> in his Journey to the <HI>Indies</HI> by Land, saith, the En∣trances into the Red-Sea, lie in twelve Degrees and forty Minutes, being no other than two Points of Land, one on <HI>Africa</HI> side, call'd <HI>Rosbel,</HI> and the other on the Coast of <HI>Arabia,</HI> lying right over against it, nam'd <HI>Ara.</HI> In the midst of the Passage lieth the Island <HI>Mium,</HI> between which and the Main Land of <HI>Asia,</HI> runneth a Channel nine or ten Yards deep, and a large League broad; as an∣other on <HI>Africa</HI> side shoots down to the depth of sixteen Yards, but useless, be∣cause it hath no convenient Haven for Ships, and many dangerous Shelves and Banks.</P>
<P>From this Port inwards, the Sea widens all along till towards the end, where it grows narrower and narrower; the broadest part is not above thirty Leagues, or <HI>Spanish</HI> Miles.</P>
<PB N="631" REF="391"/>
<P><HI>Petrus della Valla,</HI> a Noble-man of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the second Part of his Travels, describes the Red-Sea as followeth:</P>
<P>In some places of the Red-Sea, unpassable for its shallowness, they gather up a finer sort of Corral than the common; especially useful to be set in deep Caves and Grotts, because it represents perfectly the shapes of little Trees, with great delight to the Eyes of curious beholders. In these Vegetables many times, by varying colours, or transparency, Nature plays and sports it self with great curiosity.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of these Parts pass this Sea in little Barques, made of Planks joyn'd together, not with Nails, but certain Pitcht Towe.</P>
<P>Many Commodities are brought in these Boats to <HI>Cairo,</HI> which the Proprie∣tors take in pieces afterwards, and sell the Planks at dear Rates, and then re∣turn home by Land to their Houses.</P>
<P>This way of building Boats without Iron-Nails, seems to be no Novelty, considering <HI>Strabo</HI> the Geographer many Ages since speaks of Leather-Boats, used by the <HI>Arabians</HI> for pastime in the Red-Sea: As also of some other made of Osiers and Brush-wood, with which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> passed over the <HI>Nyle.</HI></P>
<P>I somewhat marvel'd (says the foremention'd <HI>Petrus della Valla</HI>) at the Name this Sea beareth, for that it is not as the Black-Sea, which is so call'd from the blackness or muddiness of the Water: For the Water of this is so clear and pure, that Men may see to the bottom, and shews afar off like other Seas. The Sand is also like that of other Seas, so that it hath borrow'd its Name no otherwise than from the King <HI>Erithreos,</HI> who (as <HI>Strabo</HI> saith) lieth buried in an Island of the South-Sea, and hath given the Name of <HI>Red</HI> to the whole; and not onely to the <HI>Arabian Gulf:</HI> but whether so or no we will not dispute, but content our selves, that the holy Scriptures calleth it so in se¦veral places.</P>

<P>In the setting down, or delineating the extent of <HI>Abyssinie,</HI> no small difference appears among Geographers; one cause whereof may be, that the borders of this Kingdom heretofore extended through more subjected Territories than at this day: for the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Galas,</HI> and other neighbouring enemies, have so nar∣row'd the bounds of these Kingdoms, by rending several Territories from them, that this present King scarce possesses the half of what his Predecessors enjoy'd; insomuch, that some make that part of <HI>Abyssine</HI> (which at this day obeys the Emperor) so small, that he scarce deserves the name of a Great King: For in the foregoing age, the <HI>Galas</HI> (a Warlike People) in their South border, either allured by the fertility of the Soyl, or the inexpertness and indisposed∣ness of the <HI>Abyssines</HI> to Arms, (their Countrey being fuller of Priests and

<P>Notwithstanding all these losses and dismembrings, the common Vogue stretches it to that vast magnitude, as makes it exceed all <HI>Europe,</HI> having in cir∣cumference above seventeen hundred <HI>Dutch,</HI> and according to <HI>Pigafet,</HI> four thou∣sand <HI>Spanish</HI> miles; but we dare be bold to aver, that at this day it doth not exceed <HI>Spain</HI> alone in bigness; and that in <HI>Africa</HI> are many other Kings which possess many more Kingdoms, and are of greater power than this so much fa∣med <HI>Abyssine.</HI></P>
<P>To reduce then this unsettlement to some certainty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigness.</NOTE> the length taken from <HI>Egypt,</HI> or rather from <HI>Bugia</HI> and <HI>Nubia,</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Monomotapa, Pigafet</HI> reckons to five hundred, and <HI>Cluverius</HI> to five hundred and eighty <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles; and the breadth, between the Mouth of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Sea, and the River <HI>Niger,</HI> to four hundred and fifty; but in truth, the length both of Old and New <HI>Abyssine,</HI> from East to West, that is, from the Mouth of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Sea, to the Kingdom of <HI>Goiame,</HI> a hundred and sixty Miles, and the greatest breadth, from the Terri∣tory of <HI>Alaba,</HI> to <HI>Magazan,</HI> or to the <HI>United</HI> Stream of the <HI>Nyle,</HI> and the River <HI>Ta∣kazu,</HI> that is, from the eighth to the sixteenth degree of North-Latitude, about a hundred and twenty miles; And in this Point, <HI>Joannes Barros a Portuguese,</HI> seems to come nearest the truth, when he gives in circumference six hundred seventy two <HI>Portuguese</HI> miles, or five hundred and four <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>

<P>But here we must observe, that in this great Roll of Kingdoms, are many Countreys found, which do not acknowledge the Emperor of <HI>Abyssine,</HI> but are onely nam'd, to shew the length, and to distinguish the borders more plainly.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake <HI>Bar-dambea.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Bar-dambea,</HI> is so call'd by the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> partly for its big∣ness, and partly from its Situation in the Kingdom of <HI>Dambea;</HI> but <HI>Ptolomy</HI> stiles it <HI>Coloe;</HI> and <HI>Joannes Barros</HI> and <HI>Mercator, Barcena.</HI> In the common Maps it hath two Names; that to the South part, <HI>Zambre,</HI> and the North part, <HI>Zaire,</HI> where they say the River <HI>Zaire,</HI> which parts <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> taketh its origi∣nal, lying in thirty Degrees and a half South Latitude, and receiveth a great increase of Water out of many several Streams and Brooks, which pour down out of the circumadjacent Mountains, Plains, and Woods. It reacheth, ac∣cording to <HI>Godignus,</HI> in length sixty <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, four of which make a <HI>German</HI> Mile; and in breadth, five and twenty: But <HI>Balthazar Tellez,</HI> a <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Jesuit, makes its greatest length on the South-side, to be twenty; and the breadth taken in the midst and broadest place, ten or twelve <HI>Spanish</HI> Miles. They say this Lake can shew eight and twenty Islands; <HI>viz. Deck,</HI> which contains twenty Acres of Land; the others less: Upon seven or eight of which there are Jesuits Cloysters, now by length of time much decay'd.</P>
<P>Most of these little Spots are fruitful, producing Oranges, Lemons, Pome∣citrons, and other Fruits. The Water of the Lake is light, very clear, healthy to drink, and full of Fish, besides Sea-Horses, which come on Land, and de∣vour the Fruits of the Field, to the great prejudice of the Husbandmen: And therefore there is a Reward appointed to all that kill them, who have also a further advantage in selling their Flesh, accounted a good Food, and their Skins to make <HI>Alenga's,</HI> far more useful to such as ride than Spurs, because they jerk hard, and strike better. But here breed neither Efts, Lizards, nor Croco∣diles, though they abound in other places of the <HI>Nyle;</HI> perhaps because these Creatures love not a clear Water, and rather chuse troubled and muddy Streams: Therefore the Cattel feed in safety upon these Shores, and the Peo∣ple inhabit there without any disturbance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abyssines</HI> of these Islands pass this Lake with small Boats, made of the Plant call'd <HI>Papyrus</HI> by the ancient <HI>Grecians;</HI> of which also the <HI>Egyptians</HI> for∣merly made Boats, and used the Leaves in stead of Paper, whereof we have treated more largely before in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>This Lake about the Summer Solstice increases; for from the vast Moun∣tains of <HI>Dambea</HI> pour down exceeding many great Streams,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dambea.</NOTE> whereby it would swell exceeding high, if it did not find an Out-let into the greatest Channel of the <HI>Nyle.</HI> Many have thought, that the <HI>Nyle</HI> takes its original out of this Lake, but without good ground, it being rather a Receptacle for it to pass through: However, it is certain, That this Lake affords it a convenient Supply by the way.</P>
<P>Into one of these Islands the Emperor banishes Rebels and Out-laws; and in another, strengthned with a Fort, keeps part of the Treasure of the Em∣pire.</P>
<P>The Lake <HI>Zella,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zella.</NOTE> or <HI>Zoay,</HI> lieth in the Kingdom of <HI>Oecie,</HI> or <HI>Ogge,</HI> on that side towards the Kingdoms of <HI>Adel</HI> and <HI>Mombaza.</HI></P>
<P>The Lake of <HI>Xacala,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xacala.</NOTE> or <HI>Sacala,</HI> lieth not far from that of <HI>Zella,</HI> and each about a days Journey in length. <HI>Sanutus</HI> sets in the beginning of <HI>Amara,</HI> on the East-side, the Lake of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> two Miles long, and half a Mile broad; and an Island in it, in which stands St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Cloyster.</P>
<PB N="641" REF="399"/>
<P>This Empire hath many and very high Mountains: <HI>viz.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountains.</NOTE> In the Kingdom of <HI>Tigre,</HI> between <HI>Fremona</HI> and <HI>Dambea,</HI> one call'd <HI>Lamalmon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balthazar Tellez.</NOTE> and another ad∣joyning call'd <HI>Guca:</HI> It is half a days Journey to climb up to the top, by an Ascent going always round, and turning by steps, like a pair of winding Stairs; but with very dangerous Precepices, and steep falls: On the top lieth a great Plain, a Mile about, where the wearied Travellers and Caravans bait and rest themselves, because the next day they have a very troublesom and dangerous way to go through, very small, narrow, and sharp; and on each side so steep, that the sight cannot reach the depth. By these narrow Paths coming to the bottom, you meet with <HI>Lamalmon,</HI> three hundred Cubits high, like a con∣tinaul Hewn Rock, which out in the Countrey seems a high and strong Castle, where the Passage is narrow and troublesom; yet Nature hath provided it with certain Steps, in manner of winding Stairs, which run up from one side to the other, very steep, and exceeding dangerous to climb up. Aloft upon this Mountain also is a Plain, about half a Mile in compass, and a Musket-shot broad. The People in this Mountain live in safety, without fear of being as∣saulted by their Enemies, and richly provided of Fresh-water and Victuals. From the top of this Mountain they have the Prospect of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Tigre;</HI> Northwards and North-Westwards lieth a Ridge of Mountains, which all together make as it were a great Fence or Inclosure.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Amara</HI> appears full of craggy steep Mountains, among which the <HI>Ape-Hills</HI> are not the least. There are also certain Ports call'd <HI>Aqui∣sagi,</HI> hewn in the Rock, between two Valleys, with very narrow Passages; be∣sides other middle Gates and Ports, about two Miles from the <HI>Aquisagi,</HI> and one from the River <HI>Anachete:</HI> Afterwards follow the Gates or Ports of <HI>Badassa,</HI> that is, the <HI>New Countrey,</HI> about four Miles from the <HI>Aquisagi,</HI> and a Mile and half from the Middle-Gates. Near which they have a Passage under Ground, where in very deep Caverns the Treasure of <HI>Prester-John</HI> is kept. At these Gates they receive the Toll for the way, and they serve for Passes between the King∣doms of <HI>Amara</HI> and <HI>Xoa.</HI></P>
<P>But that which makes this Kingdom remarkable, is the high Mountain of <HI>Amara,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Amba Guexen,</HI> by others, <HI>Quirem,</HI> and by <HI>Sanutus, The Royal Mount;</HI> because there, as he says, in a Castle nam'd <HI>Amba,</HI> all the Children of <HI>Prester-John,</HI> as in a convenient Shelter, are kept; from whence none but the Successor of the Empire can ever come out. It is so high and strong a Moun∣tain by Situation, that <HI>Alvarez, Godignus,</HI> and <HI>Sanutus,</HI> report it fifteen days Journey round at the Foot, and aloft at the top some few Miles in compass; being every where, from beneath to above, as it were cut streight up like a Wall, having onely three or four troublesom Avenues to it. <HI>Godignus</HI> makes this Rock circular, and places on the top a Plain a mile long, with one only Building, and that not very stately; and avers, That they have no Water, but the Re∣serves of Rain kept in Cisterns cut in the Rocks: But <HI>Sanutus</HI> adds a Cloyster of St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s, with eighty six Monks, and stores it with Sheep, Hens, Geese, and Fruit-Trees: And further, this we dare avouch, contrary to the Fictions of <HI>Urrettes,</HI> and others, That the Emperor hath neither a Library, nor Treasury for Gold or Precious Stones there; neither doth any Penalty fall upon a Stran∣ger, or other, entring into it.</P>
<P>Southerly from <HI>Bar-Dambea</HI> lie the Mountains of <HI>Gafale,</HI> by some mistaken for the <HI>Mountains of the Moon.</HI></P>
<P>There are no Cities in all <HI>Abyssine,</HI> but onely Towns, or Villages;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Cities in <HI>Abyssine.</HI></NOTE> and those
<PB N="642" REF="400"/>not over-plentifully inhabited: for the King himself keeps almost continually in the Field, and commonly in Tents or Pavilions. The Chiefest and most Populous Places are these, being sixty one: <HI>Bizan, Asmara, Adegada, Bebaroa, Goberea, Guele, Auzen</HI> or <HI>Tigre, Cera, Sart, Amba Salam, Amba Canet, Gama Assa, Fre∣mona, Alello, Accum, Mascalo, Maebezy, Tres Igregias, Lamalmon, Oldeba, Arbatanea, Camby, Dancaz, The Court Ganete, Jesessus, Old Gorgorra, New Gorgorra, Patriarcha, Anfras, Goga, Fogora, Atsana, Alata, Adaxa, Nebesse, Debra, Semona, Debra Ore, Saza, Adisalen, Enamora, Ligenegus, Debra Selalo, Cobela, Abola, Serea, Namina, Alagoa, Onde∣ge, Nesaca, Tancoa, Fonte de Nylo, Mine; Debra Libano, Amba Guexen, Amba Cel, Tabah Marvam, Amba Legat, Labibela, Necas Belza, Serra Belza, Bebra Marjan.</HI></P>
<P>The Air in most Places, by the Report of <HI>Godignus,</HI> hath a most healthful Temperature, being sweetly cooled and refreshed by gentle and fresh Briezes; but in the lower and Southerly Places, by the scorching heat of the Sun, it grows more malignant. In the Kingdom of <HI>Tigre, Jarrik</HI> highly extols the goodness of the Air: For (saith he) although it lie under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> yet the continual blowing of the North-winds (there not cold) so clears it, that many exceeding old People, very fresh, and strong of Limbs, are found there. The Winter, according to the same <HI>Godignus,</HI> and <HI>Sanutus,</HI> begins with the going out of <HI>May,</HI> and continues till <HI>September;</HI> during which time, it Rains and Thunders moderately every day. They begin their <HI>Lent</HI> in <HI>August,</HI> and the other Seasons follow in course.</P>
<P>As this Countrey hath many great Mountains, so it wants not some fruitful and large Plains, for the most part well Manur'd, and bearing all sorts of Grain and Fruits; in the midst whereof sometimes rise huge aspiring Rocks, which in the time of War they use for Strengths and Fortresses.</P>
<P>The Soil of <HI>Tigre</HI> is by the Shores of the River very fat,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Condition of the Soil.</NOTE> and fit with a little Labor to produce two Crops in one Year: Every Hedge-row garnish'd with good Olive-Trees, and every Field with Rye, Barly, Beans, Pease, and Tares. <HI>Fatigar</HI> appears for the most part plain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sanutus,</HI> lib. 2.</NOTE> onely here and there rising Sum∣mits, bearing Rie and Barley. The Precinct of <HI>Goroma</HI> boasts a Fertility capa∣ble of feeding Great Armies. <HI>Dancali,</HI> of small concern, and unfruitful. In some places grow Wheat, Barley, and Oats; and the Ground unfit for them, bears a Grain call'd <HI>Tafo de Guza,</HI> or <HI>Tefet,</HI> or <HI>Tef,</HI> of great worth for its good∣ness, daintiness, and durableness, subject to no Worms, but will remain good a long time; besides two others, nam'd <HI>Agoussa,</HI> and <HI>Mashella,</HI> wherewith they make very good Drink and Bread.</P>
<P><HI>Angote</HI> produces every where Rye and Barley, but with small increase; <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Wheat in abundance, besides Beans, Linseed, and <HI>Tefet:</HI> The Mountains of <HI>Abagana,</HI> Barley: The Kingdom of <HI>Amara,</HI> especially the Fields of <HI>Azzel,</HI> Barley, Rye, Oats, and all sorts of Grain.</P>
<P>There grow many several Trees,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> but most bearing Fruit of an unpleasant taste; onely one proves of excellent use in Physick: for when the <HI>Abyssines</HI> many times eat raw Flesh, which breeds Worms, which would without doubt eat through the Bowels, if they did not every Moneth purge with this Fruit, which presently causeth the Worms to die, and dischargeth the Body. They have also Citrons, contrary to the opinion of <HI>Boterus,</HI> Oranges, Pomegranates, <HI>Indian</HI>-Figs, Peaches very large and good, and ripe in the Moneths of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March;</HI> Pruens, <HI>Sebestens, Jujubes,</HI> Tamarinds, and Grapes; but no Wine made thereof, except in the Kings Houses, and by the Patriarch. They make Oyl without smell, and of a Gold-colour; not of Olives, but of a Fruit call'd
<PB N="643" REF="400"/><HI>Gecca,</HI> whose Leaf resembles that of the small Vine. They have neither Me∣lons, nor Radishes; but Ginger in abundance, and Sugar-Canes. In <HI>Barna∣gas,</HI> and the South part of <HI>Tigre,</HI> are many Woods, wherein grow Cypress and Date-Trees, Willows, Jessamine, and <HI>Basilicon,</HI> yielding an odoriferous Per∣fume to the circumambient Air. They have so much Honey, that not onely in the Cloysters among the Clergy, but all the Inhabitants in general, burn Candles of Wax, and not of Tallow.</P>
<P>All sorts of Cattel, both for use, pleasure, and profit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> breed here in abun∣dance; as Cows, Oxen, Sheep, and Goats, Mules, Asses, Camels, and Horses; of which, <HI>Sanutus</HI> and <HI>Boterus</HI> say, the best are of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> or rather of <HI>Nubia,</HI> being very hardy, Bay-colour'd, and not low of stature.</P>
<P>Their Beasts of Game are Wild Boars, Elephants, Buffles, Lions, Leopards, Tygres, Rhinocerots, and <HI>Giraffi</HI> of an extraordinary bigness; Deer, Civet-cats, Wild Goats, small Oxen and Cows, so wild and salvage, that they seem not tamable, having little Horns, standing so loose upon the Skin, that they move them as their Ears; Wolves, Catamountains, Harts, Badgers, and very great Apes.</P>
<P>They have innumerable Fowl and Poultrey; as Hens and Cocks, Par∣tridges with yellow Feet and grey Bills; tame and wild Storks, tame and wild Ducks, Pigeons, Quails, and Turtle-Doves, Paraketoes and Cuccows, Eagles, Falcons, Sparrow-Hawks, Kites, Herons, and Cranes. Moreover here are too many noxious Insects, especially of Grashoppers, which not only eat up and destroy the Grass of the Field, but the Leaves of Trees, and sometimes swarm in such innumerable Multitudes, that they cover the Earth, and for some Miles together darken the Sun: They are large like Crickets, with yellow Wings.</P>
<P>The Rivers feed all sorts of Fishes, especially <HI>Cabosos,</HI> Crocodiles, and Sea-Horses, call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Gomoras,</HI> especially in the <HI>Nyle; Torpe∣does,</HI> which numb the Hands and Bodies of those that touch them, and have a quality in them, as the <HI>Abyssines</HI> superstitiously believe, to drive away Evil Spi∣rits. In the Lake of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Amara,</HI> are found great Fish∣es, like <HI>Conger</HI>-Eels, being very fat, and said to have a better taste than any other Fish elsewhere to be had.</P>
<P>The Earth hides within her Bowels rich Veins of Metals and Minerals; but partly out of carelesness, and partly out of fear lest the <HI>Turk</HI> knowing it, should out of his greediness of Riches invade them with greater Force, they do seldom dig for them. But this opinion some reject, saying, That the <HI>Abys∣smes</HI> do as well make use of their Mines, as other People: Whereof, says <HI>Jarrik</HI> and <HI>Sanutus,</HI> they have Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, and Lead, besides whole Mountains of <HI>Sulphur.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Abyssines</HI> are all Black; yet more or less,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Constitution of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Blacker according to the nearness to the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> Line.</P></NOTE> according to their near or more remote distance to and from the Equinoctial Line; with black curl'd Hair, quick spirited, and lovers of Learning and Learned Men.</P>
<P>The Employment of their mean People consists especially in Tilling the Ground, keeping of Oxen, Cows, Goats, Horses, Mules, and Camels;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Employment.</NOTE> and greater Persons spend their time in the use of Arms. The Merchants are most <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and inclin'd to the Hunting of Wild Beasts.</P>
<P>They feed chiefly on Bread and Flesh, especially Venison, a little boyl'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> or broyl'd upon the Coals, and season'd with strong Herbs, Ginger, and Pepper.</P>
<P>For Drink, they use a Liquor made of Honey, and temper'd moderately with <HI>Opium,</HI> or the Juyce of <HI>Moons-Cap;</HI> for none may drink Wine, according to <HI>Alvarez,</HI> but those of the Royal Blood.</P>
<PB N="644" REF="401"/>
<P>The Common People go close trimm'd, without Beards or Mustachioes; but the Priests go with shaven Heads, and a long Beard. The usual Clothing of the Inferior Rank is Cotton; but the Rich go in Silk, brought them from <HI>India, Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Xumi,</HI> or Magistrates, and Provincial Governors, as also Captains and Commanders, wear long Coats of Damask, or other fine Stuff, richly embroy∣der'd, and closed with Clasps before on their Breasts.</P>
<P>The King wears a Robe of Purple, with a Crown upon his Head, set with Precious Stones: or, as <HI>Sanutus</HI> tells us, half of Gold, and half of Silver, with a Cross in his Hand, and Watchet Taffaty before his Face, which he sometimes lifts up, and lets fall again. His Coat is border'd with Gold, and hemm'd with Silk, with wide Sleeves. The Queen goes habited in white <HI>Indian</HI> Silk Stuff, cover'd over with a light Silk Mantle, with a kind of a Mask before her Face.</P>
<P>The Houses are round-built,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> and flat, cover'd over with Straw; but con∣taining within many Banquetting-Houses and Apartments. The Palaces in that Countrey call'd <HI>Betenegas,</HI> stand open round about; wherein onely the Lords may take their Residence, which wait upon the King.</P>
<P>The Salutation of the Nobility,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salutation.</NOTE> and People of Accompt, towards one ano∣ther, is perform'd by embracing with the Arms, and kissing of the Shoulder, saying, <HI>God save,</HI> or <HI>bless you;</HI> or else to fall down upon their Knees, and kiss the Earth three times.</P>
<P>Every one marries as many Women as he will;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage. <HI>Godignus,</HI> lib. 36. <HI>Jovinus,</HI> lib 8.</NOTE> but may not put them away, but for Adultery: The King has usually four, all Daughters of Neigh∣bor Kings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abyssines,</HI> yea the very Women, are diligent and zealous of Literature, taking great delight to study the Scriptures; yet there are but two Academies or Universities in the whole Empire: <HI>viz.</HI> in the Towns of <HI>Axum,</HI> and <HI>Embie.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Abyssine</HI> hath a great affinity with the <HI>Chaldean,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> Hebrew,</HI> and other Orien∣tal Tongues, and in their Alphabet have six and twenty Letters; but differs in the Names, Shape, and Order: But their manner of Reading, being from the right Hand to the left, agrees with all the Eastern Countreys. They have seven Vowels, which carry no particular Forms or Strokes, but lie hid in the mute Labial Letters themselves; which by receiving a different Prick or Stroke, signifie a several Syllable or Vowel.</P>
<P>Their Year,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Yearly Accounts.</NOTE> or the Accompt of Time, is twofold; that of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> which we have spoken of before, and the Christian <HI>Aera,</HI> from the Nativity of our Lord.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of the King, the whole Court mourns in Black, so do their very Tents. When they carry the Corps to Burial, they bear over it a Gold∣imbroider'd Pavilion, or Canopy, hung round about with Curtains of Gold and Silk, very costly. The Corps of the meaner sort are smoak'd with Fran∣kincense, wash'd, and wrapp'd in a Winding-sheet, and so convey'd to the Grave by the nearest Relations, who shave off the Hair from their Heads, but not their Beards, and clothe themselves in Black.</P>
<P>They have no common Coyn in use, but pay their Silver and Gold by weight, in small pieces; yet in some places they shew a strange Coyn of Gold, stamped with <HI>Arabick</HI> Letters. <HI>Jarrik</HI> says, they use Salt in stead of Money; and <HI>Pinto</HI> gives to the <HI>Abyssines, Oquea's</HI> of Gold, whereof every one makes twelve <HI>Portuguese Crusadoes.</HI></P>
<P>The Riches of this King are by some reckon'd very great, and by others ve∣ry
<PB N="645" REF="401"/>small. <HI>Sanutus</HI> reports, That he presented to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> at one time, for extirpating of Unbelievers, a hundred Millions of Quarter-ounces of Gold, and as many Armed Men, with Provisions. Others stick not to main∣tain, That he hath a Hall set round about with great Chests of Ebony and Cedar, which lie full of great <HI>Smaragdine</HI> Stones; and likewise Trunks, or Cabinets, full of Diamonds, Rubies, Turkoises, Sapphyres, Topazes, Jacinths, Amethysts, and other costly Precious Stones. <HI>Godignus,</HI> on the contrary, di∣minishes the Wealth of this Kingdom, alledging, That <HI>Michael Castagnoso</HI> left be∣hind him in Writing, <HI>That at a time when the King by the</HI> Portuguese <HI>Aid reduc'd some Countreys that had revolted from their Obedience, having neither Gold nor Silver to requite them for their Toil and Valour shewn in this War, he proffer'd them a Precious Stone, which he borrowed of his Mother; which the</HI> Portuguese <HI>honourably refus'd, and satisfied themselves with his Good-will and Intention.</HI> But whether it be, or ever hath been so, matters not; it being apparent enough, That they did possess greater Riches heretofore, than at this day.</P>
<P>They have good Markets for Trade, wherein the chiefest Dealers are Priests,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> exchanging Corn or Salt, against Cattel, Fowl, and other Commodities: but the dearest Merchandises are Frankincense, Pepper, and Myrrhe, which they barter for Gold.</P>
<P>Their Arms are Lances or Darts, and Back-swords.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> They use many Bowes and Arrows, but not with Feathers. For defence they put on Helmets, and very strong round Shields. Pieces of Cannon and Muskets they bought of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> at a dear Rate; yet use for the most part Darts, Arrows, and Slings. The Horse-men, in whom their greatest Strength consists, wear long Coats of Mail, which come down to their Knees, close Helmets, and round Shields, with Scymitars and Lances. They that go without a Helmet to the Wars, cover their Heads with red Hair Caps, like those of the <HI>Mamalucks</HI> in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> They provide themselves also with Elephants, Arm'd, and loaden with Towers; and have Copper Trumpets and Drums, brought thither from <HI>Cairo,</HI> with other Drums of Wood, cover'd over with a Skin, as among us.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Abyssine</HI> hath many Enemies; but chiefly upon one side the <HI>Turk,</HI> who planted themselves along the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and not only wrested that whole Coast from him, but lends his other Enemies great Assistance. On the other side lieth the Emperor of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> who continually keeps his Realm in Arms. The King of <HI>Congo</HI> neighbors close by that of <HI>Goyame,</HI> who is said to have kept himself quiet since he made Peace with King <HI>David.</HI> But the most dangerous and strongest Enemies are the <HI>Galas,</HI> or <HI>Galles,</HI> as the <HI>Abyssines</HI> call them, who in the foregoing Age have bereaved the <HI>Abyssines</HI> of a third part of their Dominions: But those of <HI>Tigrai</HI> have oftentimes worsted them, and especially in the year Sixteen hundred and seven.</P>
<P>When <HI>Prester-John</HI> doth intend to make War against the <HI>Nubians,</HI> or any other People, he causes a Cloth, in form of a Banner, to be carried on the top of a Lance, to proclaim the War through all the Countrey.</P>
<P>The Government is absolutely Monarchical,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> and the Chief known by the Title of <HI>Acegue,</HI> that is, <HI>Emperor,</HI> for the great number of Kingdoms he was wont to possess: But his Subjects entitle him <HI>Negus,</HI> that is, <HI>King;</HI> the <HI>Moors, Asiklabassi;</HI> and the <HI>Arabians, Sultan Asiklabassi:</HI> But in his Letters to the <HI>Europe∣an</HI> Princes, and others, he calls himself <HI>Negus Negas,</HI> that is, <HI>King of Kings,</HI> by reason of his Substitute Kings or Viceroys; <HI>Off-spring of the Tribe of Judah, Son of David, Son of Solomon, Son of the Pillar of Sion, Son of the Seed of Jacob, Son of
<PB N="646" REF="402"/>the hand of Mary, Son of Nahu, according to the Flesh, Emperor of the Upper, or Higher Ethiopia: King of Xaoa, Caffate, Fatigar, Angote, Baru, Amarr, Baga, Mediri, Dam∣bea, &amp;c.</HI> We generally call him <HI>Prester-John,</HI> and by some in corrupt <HI>Latin, Pretiose Joannes,</HI> that is, <HI>Precious John;</HI> to which last Name two <HI>Abyssines,</HI> coming into <HI>Europe,</HI> gave occasion themselves; for when these heard in <HI>Europe,</HI> that the Emperor was every where call'd <HI>Prester-John,</HI> they endeavor'd to pre∣serve the Title, seeking to find out Words of their Mother-Tongue, from which the same might be derived: for which purpose they consultd <HI>Belul∣gian, Beldigiam</HI> and other Names. Amongst those which first introduced the Word <HI>Belulgian</HI> here in <HI>Europe,</HI> was one <HI>Zagarab,</HI> an Ambassador sent from the Emperor of the <HI>Abyssines</HI> to <HI>John</HI> the third, King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and ano∣ther <HI>Abyssine,</HI> call'd <HI>Peter,</HI> who at the same time accompanied <HI>Francois Alva∣rez,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Priest, as Ambassador to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the seventh. The first caus'd <HI>Damaiaco a Goez,</HI> the second <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> to mistake the Name, asserting that <HI>Belulgian</HI> is a compound word of <HI>Belul</HI> and <HI>Gian,</HI> the first signifies <HI>Precious,</HI> and the other <HI>John,</HI> as if they would hint by that Name, that there was nothing more precious than the <HI>Abyssines.</HI></P>
<P>Others would have it, that <HI>Prester-John</HI> was a corrupt word, of <HI>Pharasta-Jan,</HI> that is to say, <HI>A Lyon on Horseback,</HI> because this Emperor is said to exceed all the Kings of <HI>Africa,</HI> as the Lyon excells all the Beasts. They give also the Title of Lyon, because descended from the Lyon of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> alledging that he had <HI>Meliloc</HI> for his Predecessor, that is, <HI>King of Excellency,</HI> Son of <HI>Makeda,</HI> Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> which came to hear the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>But it is certain the Name of <HI>Prester-John</HI> neither proceeded from <HI>Belulgian,</HI> nor <HI>Beldigian,</HI> nor <HI>Pharasta-Jan,</HI> or from any other such like <HI>Abyssine</HI> Word; but it was by accidentally apply'd to the <HI>Abyssine</HI> Emperor, when he first of all began to be known to the King of <HI>Portugal:</HI> But the better to discover the truth we must observe, that as the Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> were by a general Name first call'd <HI>Pharaohs,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Ptolomies;</HI> those of <HI>Persia, Xerxes,</HI> and <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Sofi;</HI> the <HI>Moorish</HI> Kings, <HI>Xeriffs;</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, <HI>Caesars;</HI> so is also the Name of <HI>Prester-John,</HI> a general Name, and signifies a Royal Title, or Dignity of some <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, who Reigned a very long time ago.</P>
<P>But these <HI>Prester-Johns</HI> have not Reigned in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> or in any other part of <HI>Africa,</HI> as many imagine, contrary to the opinion of the most experienced Geographers, who unanimously agree they Reign'd in <HI>Asia;</HI> yet in what Place not fully known: for some making them to have been Kings of <HI>Cathay,</HI> cau∣seth greater doubt and obscurity, by reason that in the next following years it came to be known, that <HI>Cathay</HI> belong'd to <HI>China,</HI> as <HI>Matthias Riccius,</HI> and after that, <HI>Benedictus Goez,</HI> both Jesuits, and next them several others have found: But besides the Tract of Land by the Name of <HI>Cathay,</HI> plac'd within the Con∣fines of <HI>China, Godignus,</HI> and with him <HI>Kircher,</HI> judge it to be probable, that there is yet a greater Countrey about the <HI>Asiatick, Scythia, Seres, Massagetania,</HI> and other neighboring People, bordering in the South and West at the Confines of <HI>China,</HI> which had the Name of <HI>Cathay,</HI> of which many years ago <HI>Prester-John</HI> had the Dominion.</P>
<P>This Countrey <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls <HI>Scythia,</HI> beyond the Mountain <HI>Imaus,</HI> and the In∣habitants <HI>Dalanguer</HI> and <HI>Negrecet,</HI> begins at the Foot of <HI>Mount Taurus,</HI> and spreads to the <HI>Icy Sea,</HI> dividing <HI>Scythia</HI> in two. <HI>Paulus Marcus</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> calls it <HI>The Dominion of the great Cham;</HI> and the holy Scripture, according to the testimony of <HI>Arias Montanus, Gog and Magog.</HI></P>
<PB N="645" REF="402"/>
<P>One of the chiefest Kingdoms of this <HI>Great Cathay,</HI> is <HI>Tebeth,</HI> near the King∣dom of <HI>Belor,</HI> or <HI>Balor,</HI> the antient Dwelling-place of the <HI>Zaker;</HI> near which the Geographers, according to the example of <HI>Marcus Paulus</HI> the <HI>Venetian,</HI> place the City <HI>Cambalu;</HI> so then <HI>Cathay</HI> compasseth that whole Part of <HI>Asia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cambalu</HI> is by many ta∣ken for the great City <HI>Po∣king</HI> in <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> placeth beyond the Mountain <HI>Imaus,</HI> and borders in the East, on the Ocean and <HI>China;</HI> in the South, on the Head-Spring of the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> at the Mountain <HI>Caucasus, Parapanisus,</HI> and <HI>Aria;</HI> in the West, on whole <HI>Scythia,</HI> with∣in the Mountain <HI>Imaus;</HI> and lastly in the North, at the <HI>Icy Sea:</HI> Whereby it ap∣pears that all <HI>Great Tartary,</HI> lying beyond the Mountain <HI>Imaus,</HI> with the Name of <HI>Cathay,</HI> must be understood to be the Countreys of <HI>Gog and Magog;</HI> for <HI>Cathay,</HI> which signifieth in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Tongue, <HI>A Kingdom full of Mountains and Desarts,</HI> contains <HI>Tartary, Scythia,</HI> and the Countreys of <HI>Gog and Magog.</HI> Now <HI>Cathay</HI> is divided into the greater, and the less: <HI>Great Cathay</HI> spreads through an unfre∣quented Tract of Land, namely from the Mountain <HI>Caucasus,</HI> between that side of the <HI>Icy Sea,</HI> and the Mountains of <HI>China</HI> to the <HI>Indian Sea;</HI> whereas some will have it joyn at the out-lying Point of <HI>America:</HI> But <HI>Little Cathay</HI> is that Countrey which borders on <HI>North-China,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P>In all this far spreading Countrey of <HI>Cathay,</HI> one may see, that this supposed most mighty Emperor, <HI>Prester-John,</HI> had the Dominion over seventy two King∣doms, partly <HI>Christians,</HI> and partly <HI>Heathens,</HI> though by the great numbers of Kingdoms he hath gotten many Names, to the great distraction both of Histo∣rians and Geographers: For some make him to be one and the same with the great <HI>Cham,</HI> others call him <HI>Ashid;</HI> some with the <HI>Abyssines</HI> call him <HI>Juchanes Belul,</HI> that is <HI>Precious John.</HI> Some, as <HI>Godignus,</HI> with no improbable Reasons, will have it, that by his Subjects, for their high esteem of the Prophet <HI>Jonas,</HI> he is call'd <HI>Joanne,</HI> a Name common to all those that ever did possess this King∣dom; though in these Western Parts he is commonly call'd by the <HI>Latin Churches, Joannes,</HI> with the additional surname of <HI>Prester,</HI> not that he ever was a Priest, but because, according to the Custom of the Arch-bishop, in the time of Peace had a Cross carried before him at his going out; but ontring upon the Wars, two Cross-bearers went before him, the one with a Cross of Gold, and the other with a Cross beset with Precious Stones, for a token of his defending the Worship of God: for which reason <HI>Scaliger</HI> derives his Name from the <HI>Persian</HI> Word <HI>Prestigiani,</HI> which signifieth <HI>Apostolick;</HI> which the <HI>Europeans</HI> understanding amiss, call'd him in stead of <HI>Prestigiani, Prester-John.</HI></P>
<P>Many years did this Kingdom of <HI>Prester-John</HI> flourish in <HI>Asia,</HI> till it fell to one <HI>David,</HI> who by one of his supreme Commanders call'd <HI>Cinge,</HI> chosen Em∣peror by the Army and the <HI>Scythians,</HI> who in stead of <HI>Prester</HI> styl'd him <HI>Uncam:</HI> In the Year Eleven hundred seventy eight it was overcome in Battel; whereby the glory of this Empire, and the Name of <HI>Prester-John</HI> came in effect to an end, to the great loss and prejudice of <HI>Christendom.</HI> But by what mistake the Name of <HI>Prester-John</HI> came to the Emperor of <HI>Abyssine,</HI> we will in brief declare: When the <HI>Portuguese</HI> with their Fleets were busie in discovering strange Countreys, there was a great noyse through all <HI>Europe,</HI> of <HI>Prester-John</HI> and his Excellency, reported a most powerful Emperor, Lord of many Kings, and of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, but unknown in what place he had his abode. For which cause when <HI>Pike Kovillan,</HI> sent by <HI>John</HI> the second King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> first over the <HI>Medi∣terranean Sea,</HI> and afterwards by Land, to seek out this Prince, coming into <HI>India,</HI> and hearing, that in <HI>Abyssine,</HI> or that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> which lieth below <HI>Egypt,</HI> was a great and powerful Prince, who professed the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, he went thi∣ther,
<PB N="648" REF="403"/>and finding many things in him which was reported of the true <HI>Prester-John,</HI> he took him for the same Person, and was the first that call'd him by that Name, which others that went the ensuing year into <HI>Abyssine,</HI> follow'd, and so easily brought the mistake into <HI>Europe,</HI> the Emperor of <HI>Abyssine</HI> being ever since call'd <HI>Prester-John:</HI> Yet <HI>Damianus</HI> a <HI>Goez,</HI> in his Book of the Nature and Customs of the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> positively denies that the King of <HI>Abyssine</HI> was ever call'd <HI>Prester-John;</HI> so that in truth that Name properly belongs to the foremention'd Prince of <HI>Asia:</HI> But seeing that Custom hath almost made it a Law, and the Kingdom of <HI>Prester-John</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> already overwhelm'd, the Name of <HI>Prester-John</HI> may conveniently be applied and fixed upon the <HI>Abyssine</HI> King of <HI>Africa,</HI> professing the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Every Substitute Kingdom, as <HI>Tigre, Gambea, Goiame, Amara, Narea,</HI> hath a Deputy to Rule it in the Name of the Emperor; and the like hath every Ter∣ritory: Besides, the Vice-Roy of <HI>Tigre</HI> bears the Title <HI>Tigra Mahon,</HI> and must always be of the Royal Stock. Him of the Countrey next to the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> they stile <HI>Barnagas,</HI> that is, <HI>King of the Sea;</HI> not that he properly Commands over the Countreys by the Sea, for they are under the <HI>Turks,</HI> but because the Coun∣trey over which he Commands, lieth nearer to Sea than any other part of <HI>Tigre.</HI> He hath his abode most in the City <HI>Barva</HI> or <HI>Debaroa,</HI> and winneth great Re∣spect, as well among his own People as Strangers.</P>
<P>The Government of the Kingdom is administred with Discretion and Ju∣stice, which hath advanced the honor of the King both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The Judges shew great severity in punishing Offenders, according to the se∣veral qualities of their Crimes, <HI>viz.</HI> such as shrink from the right and true Faith, and change their Opinion, the People stone to death; but those which totally Apostatize, or blaspeme God and the Ghost, are publickly burn'd alive; Murderers they deliver to the nearest Relations of the Murthered, to revenge themselves on him according to their pleasure: Thieves have their Eyes put out, and afterwards by Judgment are appointed for Slaves of the Empire, and given to the Guides, with whom they may go all the Countrey over, to earn their Living by Singing and Playing on Instruments; but with this Proviso, not to stay above one day in a place, upon penalty of losing their lives. Other small Offences they punish with Whipping.</P>
<P>In the Succession of the Crown, the eldest takes place after the Father, but for want of Issue-male, the most worthy Person of the next in Blood is chosen. Others affirm, that Seniority creates no Claim, but that the Crown falls to him whom the Father makes choice of on his Death-bed; but that seems im∣probable, because the intended Successor lives at large in the Courts, whereas the rest are kept on the Mountain <HI>Amara;</HI> and if he die, another, whom the greatest at the Court do judge fittest for the Crown, is sent for out.</P>
<P>The great and famous Island <HI>Meroe</HI> lies divided between three Kings, which oftentimes War with one another; the first is a <HI>Mahumetan Moor;</HI> the second, an Idolater, descended from the Blood of the right <HI>Ethiopians;</HI> the third, a <HI>Christian Abyssine,</HI> and acknowledges that King for his Lord.</P>

<P><HI>Jovius</HI> writes, that this King <HI>David</HI> subdu'd the <HI>Troglodites,</HI> and took <HI>Casante</HI> the King of <HI>Mosambique</HI> Prisoner. He vanquished and kill'd the General of the Queen of <HI>Bethsage,</HI> near the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and handled the King of <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Torme</HI> so roughly, that he compell'd him to pay a very great Tribute, and gave Hostages.

<P><HI>Claudius</HI> his Son, otherwise call'd <HI>Aznassaghet</HI> by <HI>Genebrard,</HI> which signifieth, <HI>He is worshipped to the utmost ends of the Earth.</HI> He subdu'd the King of <HI>Adel</HI> in revenge of his Father's death, and died in the Year One thousand five hundred fifty nine, having Reign'd 20 years.</P>

<P><HI>Sarsadenghil,</HI> or <HI>Sarsadinghil,</HI> the Son of <HI>Adamas,</HI> by his own direction call'd <HI>Malak Sequet,</HI> had two Brothers, each of them having several Sons, the King had but one, and that illegitimate, by Name <HI>Haste Jacob,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord Jacob,</HI> Prince of <HI>Nerea,</HI> who after his Fathers death possessed the Kingdom, and conti∣nued, saith <HI>Godignus,</HI> seven years in the Government; he endeavor'd to extir∣pate <HI>Christianity:</HI> Whereupon a certain Prince, by Name <HI>Susneos,</HI> who favor'd the Professors thereof, sided with them, and making use of that occasion to set up his pretence to the Kingdom, took up Arms against this <HI>Jacob.</HI> Till the Year Sixteen hundred and twenty eight this War continued, when King <HI>Jacob,</HI> wounded by the Shot of an Arrow, found himself necessitated to retire to a Fort, where after a few days he died, leaving two Sons, the one nam'd <HI>Cosme,</HI> eighteen years of age; the other about sixteen, by Name <HI>Zaga-Christ,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Treasure of God;</HI> which were both then in the Island <HI>Meroe,</HI> in the City <HI>Aich,</HI> where usually the Children of <HI>Prester-John</HI> are Nursed and Educated.</P>
<P>The Queen-Mother <HI>Nazarena,</HI> seeing this mishap in her Family, arisen by the death of the King her Husband, and that Prince <HI>Susneos,</HI> the new King, en∣deavoured to suppress all those whom his Predecessor had favored, instantly sent her Sons notice of their Fathers death, ordering them to retire from <HI>Meroe</HI> to some faithful Friends of the Emperor their late Father: And to that end she sent them much Gold and rich Jewels to maintain them, and to raise some Troops to revenge the death of their Father.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Cosmes</HI> the eldest, took his way to the South, towards the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> the other, <HI>Zaga-Christ,</HI> drew Northwards with a Company of about five hundred Men, to the Kingdom of <HI>Sanar,</HI> his Inheritance: from thence to the Kingdom of <HI>Fungi,</HI> where he was nobly entertain'd by the King, whose Name was <HI>Orbat,</HI> a Vassal of <HI>Prester-Johns:</HI> but not suffer'd to rest quiet there, he was forced to withdraw, being pursu'd by the Horsemen of King <HI>Susneos</HI> so close, that he was necessitated to go through the sandy Desarts of <HI>Arabia</HI> but
<PB N="653" REF="405"/>with the number of fifty Servants; for all the other, fearing the wearisom∣ness of the Way, left him; then he came into <HI>Egypt</HI> to the City <HI>Corrigia,</HI> and lastly to <HI>Grand Cair,</HI> where he was well receiv'd by the <HI>Copticks,</HI> and hono∣rably entertain'd by the <HI>Bashaw</HI> for the space of two days: Thence he with∣drew, scarce accompanied with fifteen Servants (for the other remain'd, be∣cause of weariness and sickness, in <HI>Cair</HI>) to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> into which he came at the <HI>Purification,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty and two. He went out of <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> but with three Servants and eight Clergy-men to <HI>Nazareth,</HI> where he made Confession of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion; and after the stay of some Moneths left off all his Servants, and from thence came by Ship to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope, who gave him a Palace for his Residence; where he stay'd two years, and then went from thence into <HI>France,</HI> and stay'd at <HI>Paris</HI> about three years, and died at last at <HI>Ruel</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty eight.</P>
<P><HI>Susneos,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred twenty nine, took upon him the Sovereignty, and nam'd himself <HI>Saghed,</HI> that is, <HI>Worshipped of all,</HI> employing all his Forces to extirpate the Stock of King <HI>Jacob:</HI> And having confirm'd and setled his new-gain'd Dominion, he died in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty and three, and his Son <HI>Fasilatas</HI> succeeded him.</P>
<P>It is by many concluded, that the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Nicaules,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> and by others <HI>Makede,</HI> who came out of the South to hear the Wisdom of <HI>So∣lomon</HI> in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and Commanded over these Countreys, planted her Impe∣rial Seat in the Island of <HI>Meroe,</HI> having learn'd from <HI>Solomon</HI> the knowledge of the true God, so that both she and her People began to embrace the Doctrine of <HI>Moses.</HI> But after the encrease of <HI>Christianity,</HI> they receiv'd that Doctrine, first brought into <HI>Abyssine</HI> by the Eunuch of Queen <HI>Candace,</HI> by Name <HI>Indich;</HI> for he being Baptiz'd in the Way from <HI>Gaza</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by <HI>Philip,</HI> upon the command of the Angel, as we hinted before, he afterwards Baptiz'd the Queen, and all the Subjects of the Countrey. But after the Division of the World among the Apostles, they say, the <HI>Abyssines</HI> fell to <HI>St. Matthew,</HI> who ga∣ther'd a rich harvest of Souls there.</P>
<P>Afterwards this People, together with the <HI>Copticks,</HI> receiv'd the Doctrine and Errors of <HI>Dioscorus</HI> and <HI>Eutiches,</HI> and elected a Patriarch to oversee the Church, who hath his chief Residence in the City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and appoints a Substitute in <HI>Abyssine</HI> nam'd <HI>Eteche,</HI> or <HI>Chomos,</HI> who hath many Bishops under him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abyssines</HI> (captivated with the destructive Opinions of <HI>Eutiches</HI> and <HI>Dioscorus</HI>) believe, That the Souls of the Saints, after their death, do not go di∣rectly to Heaven, but to the terrestrial Paradice, to remain there till the day of Judgment; That the Wicked do not go immediately to Hell, but to a place near adjacent, in which they can see the Punishment prepared for them, wait∣ing in the mean while for the day of Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Damianus</HI> a <HI>Goez</HI> affirms, that they conclude a Purgatory, and believe that the Souls of the vertuous are not plagued there on Saturdays and Sundays, and that Alms-deeds do exceedingly serve for the mitigating of their pain; but deny that their <HI>Eteche,</HI> or Patriarch, can grant Souls any liberty to go out, judging that onely to belong to God, who hath limited, or set the time of their punishment.</P>
<P><HI>Godignus</HI> affirms, that Children are Baptiz'd with Fire and Water, imprinting a Mark upon their Foreheads, which they must carefully keep; for they hold it fit to follow the Rule which the Forerunner of <HI>Christ</HI> seems to have Preach∣ed,
<PB N="654" REF="406"/>when he said, <HI>I shall baptize you in the Spirit and in Fire;</HI> but others think, that the first <HI>Christian</HI> Kings of <HI>Abyssine</HI> did it to distinguish the Believers from Hea∣thens.</P>
<P>Between the Religion or Worship of the <HI>Egyptians, Copticks,</HI> and <HI>Abyssines,</HI> there is no difference at all; for both these People perform the Mass in the same manner, and consent in the Church Ceremonies, which they observe in the Consecration of the Body and Blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> which they perform in this manner: The Priest at the appointed hour comes into the Church, and when the People are assembled, in his Priestly Vestments ascends to the Altar, the Deacon crying with a loud voyce in the <HI>Coptick</HI> Tongue, <HI>Blessed be the Participa∣tion;</HI> whereupon the Priest, turning to the People, with a loud voyce often re∣peats these words, <HI>Christ be with us all,</HI> and the the People answer, <HI>And with thy spirit;</HI> After several Ceremonies perform'd, with Songs of Praise and Thanks∣giving, and at last Prayers being ended, the Priest blesseth the Cover, the Cha∣lice or Cup, the Spoon and Shrine, or Coffer of the Sacrament, by which they understand, <HI>The Ark of the Covenant,</HI> as by the Spoon, <HI>The Spear of Christ,</HI> and be∣gin the Participation, with stretched out hands, thus:</P>
<P><Q>O Lord Jesus Christ, Partaker of the Divine Substance, who art im∣maculate, together with the Father and holy Spirit, our Father, our Lord, our God, and our Redeemer: Thou art that Bread which descended from Heaven; Thou who art come to be a Lamb without blemish, for the re∣demption and life of the World, we ask and pray thy Deity, that thou wilt set thy Countenance upon this holy Mystery, upon this Bread and upon this Cup, which we Priests do set upon this Table: Bless, sanctifie, cleanse, and transmute this Bread into thy holy Body, and this Wine in this Cup, into thy holy and precious Blood.</Q></P>
<P>In like manner says the <HI>Abyssine</HI> Priest:</P>
<P><Q>Our Prince Jesus Christ, whose Substance is not created, but thou art the pure Word: Thou art the Son of the Father; Thou art the Bread of Life, come down from Heaven; Thou wert before thou camest in the similitude of an immaculate Lamb for the redemption of Sinners. Now, O thou lo∣ver of Mankind, we humbly beseech thy Majesty to shew thy favorable Countenance and Benediction upon this Bread, and upon this Cup on this Altar; Bless, sanctifie, purifie, and transmute this Bread into thy undefiled Flesh, and this Wine into thy precious Blood.</Q></P>
<P>Concerning the rest, they use one and the same manner of Incense, and the same words of Consecration, the same form of Confession, and the same words of Adoration.</P>
<P>In the Consecration of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, both these Peo∣ple observe one and the same Ceremonies. The <HI>Abyssine</HI> expresseth it with a loud voyce thus:</P>
<P><Q>He stretcheth out his hands to the feeble; He is become weak, that he may strengthen those that wait upon him: who the same Night wherein he was betray'd, took Bread into his holy and immaculate Hands, looked up to heaven to his Father; he gave thanks, blessing and sanctifying it, and gave to his Disciples, saying, Take and eat ye all of it: This Bread is my Flesh, which is given for the remission of sins. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Whereupon the People say:</P>
<P><Q>Verily, verily, verily, we believe, and trust, and love thee, O Lord our God.</Q> This we believe in truth is thy Flesh.</P>
<PB N="655" REF="406"/>
<P>Then saith the Priest again:</P>
<P><Q>In like manner he took the Cup, and gave thanks, blessed and sanctifi'd it, and said to them, Take and drink ye all of it: This is the Cup of my Blood which shall be shed for you, for the redemption of many.</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon the People answer:</P>
<P><Q>Verily, verily, verily, we believe, and trust, and love thee, O Lord our God.</Q> This we believe in truth is thy Blood.</P>
<P>In the same manner it is done by the <HI>Copticks.</HI> That the <HI>Coptick</HI> and <HI>Abyssine</HI> Church hath been one and the same from all Antiquity, <HI>Nicephorus, Zonoras, Cedrenus,</HI> and lastly the <HI>Abyssine</HI> Rituals themselves, do testifie; for the common Liturgy, the Admonition that is made of Praying for the welfare of the <HI>Abys∣sine</HI> Church, for the King and Princes of the Empire, Judges and Subjects, there is also in particular made mention of the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in these words:</P>
<P><Q>Pray for our Prince, and our Patriarch, <HI>N. N.</HI> Lord and Head of the Bishops of the great Territory of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and for our Reverend Arch-Bishop <HI>Mark,</HI> the Head of our Countrey, and for all Bishops, Priests, and true believing Ministers.</Q></P>
<P>In other Admonitions, the Evangelist <HI>Mark, Theon, Petrus, Alexander, Athana∣sius, Theophilus, Cyrillus,</HI> and other Patriarchs of <HI>Alexandria</HI> are remembred; which abundantly shew, that the <HI>Egyptian, Coptick,</HI> and <HI>Abyssine,</HI> are in effect but one Church. The <HI>Abyssine</HI> and <HI>Coptick</HI> are under one and the same Patriarch, who hath his Residence in <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in <HI>Abyssine</HI> hath a Substitute under him, the Head in Ecclesiastical Causes, there call'd <HI>Eteche,</HI> as we said be∣fore.</P>
<P>This Man is chosen by the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> or by the Monks of <HI>Abyssine,</HI> and confirm'd by the Patriarch. His chiefest Office consists in con∣ferring of holy or sacred Orders (though the bestowing of Church-Offices be∣longs to the <HI>Xeques,</HI> or King) and the punishing the obstinate, such as stand in contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Godignus,</HI> against the opinion of many, maintains they have no Bishops; but others, that the <HI>Eteche</HI> hath twelve Suffragans under him.</P>
<P>A Clerk may have one Wife, but is not made Priest till three years after that. After the death of the first Wife no Priest may Marry again, but by spe∣cial consent of the <HI>Eteche;</HI> yet then he may never celebrate Mass any more: a matter so severely observed by them, that they do not so much as touch a Candle Consecrated for the Church.</P>
<P>If a Clerk or Priest get a Bastard-Child, they instantly put him out of his Office; and if he dies without lawful Children, his Goods Escheat to the King.</P>
<P>They have many Monks, which follow the Rules of <HI>St. Anthony, St. Maccair,</HI> and <HI>St. Basil:</HI> They accommodate themselves every where to the Clergy, which they boldly visit, do great Penance, live soberly, and Fast often.</P>
<P>All the Clergy, to the very <HI>Eteche,</HI> and Bishops, dwell in Cloysters, in the Cities, and in the Wildernesses: they go bare-foot, never eat Flesh, nor drink Wine, and do besides unusual severe Penance: for besides Fasting, they tor∣ment themselves terribly, by being bound to a Cross, and so set for a whole day broyling in the Sun. Others go stark naked up to the neck into a cool Brook, and stay there till they are half dead.</P>
<P>Some, which they call <HI>The Clergy of Libela,</HI> for a Penance carry two four∣square
<PB N="656" REF="407"/>pieces of Lead of fifty or sixty pound weight, which hang before their Breasts, and behind their Backs, with which so about them they fall upon their Knees, with their Foreheads upon the Ground, so that many times their Heads swell, and their Bodies grow all black and blue. Others sit with a great Stone about their Necks, which so bows down their Heads that they cannot look up to Heaven, nor move themselves from the places where they are.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Abyssines,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumcision.</NOTE> as well Clergy as Temporality, are Circumcised the eighth day after their Birth, and Baptiz'd the fortieth, but the Daughters the sixtieth: and afterwards in their sixth year are Re-baptiz'd with Fire in this manner: They take a sharp Iron, which cuts on both sides, and making it red hot in the Fire, set therewith upon the very tip of their Nose two Marks, to distinguish them from <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> who are also Circumcised.</P>
<P>The Water of Baptism they Consecrate with many Ceremonies and Bene∣dictions; with which they renew their Baptism every year upon the Day of the <HI>Three Kings,</HI> because upon that day <HI>Christ</HI> was Baptized.</P>
<P>The Confession of their sins they say they have by Apostolical command, which they make standing; after which they receive Absolution. <HI>Godignus</HI> avers, that they neither make known the particulars, nor the number of their sins, but say onely in general, <HI>Habessen, Habessen,</HI> which signifies, <HI>I have sinn'd, I have sinn'd.</HI> They hold onely five mortal sins, fixing upon the last Chapter of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> which excludes out of the holy City, Sorcerers, Fornicators or Adulterers, Murderers, Idolaters and Lyars. They acknowledge but five Commandments, imply'd by <HI>Christ</HI> in these Negatives:</P>
<P><HI>I have been hungry, and ye have not fed me; I have been thirsty, and you have not given me drink; I have been a stranger, and you have not let me in; I have been naked, and you have not clothed me; I have been sick, and you have not visited me; I have been in prison, and you have not come to me:</HI> Believing that <HI>Christ</HI> will say to Reprobates onely these words at the last Day.</P>
<P>They perform Mass daily, yet no more but one in every Church, and that usually in the Evening, an hour and a half before the going down of the Sun, except on <HI>Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sundays.</HI></P>
<P>They ordinarily bury their Dead with a Cross and Prayers, reading over them the <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>St. John,</HI> the next day give some Alms for the benefit of their Souls.</P>
<P>They Fast every <HI>Wednesday,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damian Goez.</NOTE> in remembrance of the Council of the <HI>Jews,</HI> upon the Death of <HI>Christ,</HI> which was held upon that day: and every <HI>Friday,</HI> in Com∣memoration of the Death of <HI>Christ,</HI> eating nothing before the going down of the Sun; observing besides with other <HI>Christians,</HI> several other times of Ab∣stinence.</P>
<P>Some of the Clergy in the Cloysters always eat Flesh, because they lie far from the Sea, and have no Lakes nor Rivers, out of which to take Fish. Others eat on Fasting-days but onely an Apple, with Bread and Water, or else some Herbs boyl'd, without Oyl or Butter; and some onely Bread and Water. Such as eat Fish, in some Places will touch nothing that hath any Bloud, but con∣tent themselves with Grashoppers, Oysters, Lobsters, and the like. Also they use upon Fasting-days a Grain call'd <HI>Camfa,</HI> and another <HI>Tebba,</HI> both prepar'd and made ready like Mustard.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Abyssines</HI> have made defection from their antient Opinions, ac∣knowledging the <HI>Roman</HI> Church to have the true Doctrine, and the Pope to be <HI>Christ</HI>'s Vicar: for in the time of Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the seventh, <HI>Prester-John</HI> sent to
<PB N="657" REF="407"/>acknowledge him High-Priest, with promise of obedience to him and his Suc∣cessors: and all that have succeeded him have done the same, till the Year Sixteen hundred and nine, when the Prince of <HI>Narel, Jacob,</HI> infected with the Errors of <HI>Dioscorus</HI> and <HI>Eutiches,</HI> got the Crown. After him the Son of <HI>Zaga-Christ,</HI> who in the Year Sixteen hundred thirty and three, stept into the Throne, embraced the same Opinions, so that he put out of the City all those that ac∣knowledged and obeyed the Pope. But <HI>Cosme,</HI> Son of King <HI>Haste Jacob,</HI> about the Year Sixteen hundred and thirty, caused in the Kingdom of <HI>Dambea,</HI> near his Court, a Church to be built after the <HI>European</HI> manner, of Cedar-wood, and <HI>Zaga-Christ</HI> his Brother, and all his Family, heard Mass openly in the King∣dom of <HI>Goyame:</HI> And moreover, being a singular Votary of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Religion, established, among others, those Laws, That no Clergy-man that is Marry'd may administer the Lords Supper upon pain of death; That no tem∣poral Person may have any more but one Wife; and, That none should draw near to the Lords Table before he had made satisfaction to all whom he had wronged.</P>
<P>In the Year Sixteen hundred and twenty, in the Territory of <HI>Agoas,</HI> a spa∣cious Countrey and fruitful, five thousand Souls were Baptiz'd by the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> Jesuits. The several states of the Countreys relating to Religion, are as followeth.</P>

<P>In several places of <HI>Africa,</HI> especially in <HI>Abyssine,</HI> there grows a Plant, call'd by the <HI>Moors, Muz</HI> and <HI>Gemez;</HI> by the <HI>East-Indians, Melapolanda;</HI> by the <HI>Egyptians, Mauz;</HI> by the Natives of <HI>St. Thomas Island, Abella;</HI> by the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins, Max∣graita;</HI> in the Scripture, <HI>Dudaim;</HI> by others, <HI>Pharaohs Figs,</HI> and <HI>Apples</HI> of <HI>Paradise,</HI> some conceiting that <HI>Adam</HI> eat of this Fruit; among whom are the Learned <HI>St. Augustine, Moses Berzepha,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Syria, Nicephorus, Calistus, Ambrosius,</HI> and most of all the Rabbies. It groweth to the heighth of a Pomegranate-Tree, with∣out any Branches, and but few Leaves, resembling a Reed; for at first they appear rowl'd up together, but afterwards spread themselves wide, and grow∣ing to six or seven Yards in length, and almost one in breadth, so that any may shelter themselves from the scorching of the Sun under one of them, which some make a strong argument to prove, that with the Leaves of this Tree the Father of Mankind cover'd himself in <HI>Eden,</HI> upon the discovery of his nakedness. The Fruit resembles a small Cucumber, but hangs together in Bunches: the Rhind of a Gold-yellow colour, lovely to look on, and fragrant in smell. The Fruit within somewhat like that of a Cucumber, but tender, juicy, sweet, without Stones or Kernels, and wondrous delicious to such as use to eat it.</P>
<P>Another Plant,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plant <HI>Bahabab.</HI></NOTE> which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> call <HI>Bahabab,</HI> or <HI>Baobab,</HI> groweth wild here, bearing Fruit in bigness and fashion like a Gourd, but the Leaves bearing the similitude of those of an Orange-Tree. The Fruit pluck'd from the Tree, hath not onely a most delicious taste, but quencheth the Thirst, and cooleth extraordinarily.</P>
<P>Thus have we led you a toylsom Journey through the Heats and Wastes of <HI>Africa</HI> in the Main Land; we will now give you a short sight of the Islands be∣longing to it, and so leave you to your contemplations of what you have read and observed therein.</P>

<P>THe Island, commonly by Geographers call'd <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and in the Countrey Language <HI>Madecase;</HI> by <HI>Theuck, Albazgra;</HI> by the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Arabians, Sazandib;</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese, Ilha de sam Lourengo,</HI> from the first Discoverer <HI>Laurence Almeide,</HI> Son of <HI>Francois Almeide,</HI> Viceroy of the East-Indies for the King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> who in the Year Fifteen hundred and six, put with eight Ships, first of all into this Island of <HI>St. Laurence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gaspar de St. Bernardino,</HI> in his Journey through <HI>India</HI> by Land, affirms, That in the Year Fifteen hundred and eight (with whom agrees <HI>Damianas de Goez</HI>) it was discover'd on the outside, and a little afterwards, the inside scarifi'd by one <HI>Ruy Pircira de Kontinho;</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Tristano da Kunha,</HI> who Sail'd quite round it, upon the Command of <HI>Alfonso d' Albuquerque.</HI></P>
<P>There are that report this Island was known to the Antients,

<P>It spreads in length North North-East,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation. <HI>Flakkourt. Fraxscis.

<P>It is one of the greatest Islands in the World; for the length from South to North hath been reckon'd to twelve hundred <HI>Spanish,</HI> or two hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles; though <HI>Linschot</HI> says two hundred and twenty, the breadth seventy, and the Circumference nine hundred.</P>
<P>The Sea between the Island and the Main Land, towards that side of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> sets with a strong Current, and goeth with a mighty Tide of Eb∣bing and Flowing; making a Channel at the Westerly entrance, eighty five Miles broad; and in the middle, where it is narrower, over against the Island <HI>Mosambike,</HI> four and forty <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles; but it grows wider again towards the East. The Ships which go from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and from thence back again, Sail commonly through this Channel, unless Storms and Tempests force them to Steer another course.</P>

<P>We will give you a particular account of each, with what is remarkable therein: Beginning first with <HI>Carkanossi,</HI> and from thence will run up North∣ward to the <HI>Bay of Antongil;</HI> so turn back to the South, from <HI>Carkanossi</HI> to the River <HI>Ongelahe.</HI></P>

<P>From <HI>Karemboule</HI> to the Mouth of the River <HI>Sakalite,</HI> the Coast runs North-West, and from thence to the seventeenth degree South-Latitude, North North-East; and thence to the fourteenth degree, being the Road of the Island due North.</P>
<P>The whole extent comprehends many beneficial and large Rivers, that ha∣ving their heads within the Land, irrigate the same to a rich fecundity, and at last emit their Waters into the Sea; by which means there appear divers fine Bays, which make convenient and safe Roads for Ships.</P>
<P>The South-side from the <HI>Cape of Itapere</HI> to <HI>Karemboule,</HI> the People of <HI>Europe</HI> best know; by most of whom frequented, but especially by the <HI>French,</HI> who have to the chief Bay assign'd the Name of <HI>Dauphin,</HI> from a neighboring Fort by them Built on the Land: But the Inhabitants call it <HI>Tolonghare,</HI> scituate between two Points, the one call'd <HI>Itapere,</HI> in five and twenty degrees, and thirty minutes South-Latitude; and the other the Point of <HI>Dauphin-Bay,</HI> in five and twenty de∣grees and ten minutes.</P>
<P>Next follows the Inlet of <HI>Ranoufouthi,</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd, <HI>The Bay of the Gallions;</HI> there, <HI>The Bay of Karemboule,</HI> thirty Miles from the Fort of <HI>Dauphin.</HI></P>

<P>This River,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Franshere.</HI></NOTE> otherwise call'd <HI>Ravenatte,</HI> or <HI>Imours,</HI> takes original out of the Mountain of <HI>Manghare,</HI> in five and twenty degrees and eighteen minutes South-Latitude, two small miles from Fort <HI>Dauphin,</HI> falling into the Sea; having first receiv'd the Water of many small Brooks, as <HI>Akondre, Imanhal, Manamboaa, Andra∣voulle,</HI> and some other.</P>
<P>The Water of this River, about a mile up in the Countrey, is always brack∣ish; and at the Mouth makes a Lake or Pool call'd <HI>Ambove,</HI> of a large half mile broad, and deep enough to bear a Ship.</P>
<P>It feeds many Crocodiles, as all the other Rivers of this Island.</P>
<P>Half a mile from the Mouth of <HI>Franshere,</HI> lieth <HI>Cape St. Romain,</HI> so nam'd by the <HI>French;</HI> but by the <HI>Blacks, Rancratte,</HI> or <HI>Hehohale,</HI> which shews six or seven Leagues into the Sea from the North-West.</P>
<P>Next this <HI>Cape</HI> appears a great Creek, in form of a Cross, extending to the Point of the River call'd <HI>Dian Pansonge,</HI> or <HI>Fitorah;</HI> in the middle of <HI>Tolanghare,</HI> an Isle shews it self: to the Northward of which, you may see the Fort <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and behind that, the Haven of the same name.</P>
<P>From thence to <HI>Cape St. Romain,</HI> the Coast bears the name of <HI>Sivoure,</HI> from a Lake, made by five or six small Brooks meeting therein; which in time of great Rain, overflows the adjacent Grounds.</P>
<P>The other Point of <HI>Dauphin-Bay,</HI> is <HI>Cape Itapere;</HI> next which follows the <HI>Bay of Lonkar,</HI> in five and twenty degrees, affording a commodious and safe Harbor for Ships and other Vessels to Ride there; onely the coming in is dangerous, by reason of obscure Rocks.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this lies the Island <HI>St. Clare,</HI> so styl'd by the <HI>French,</HI> being a small Spot before the Haven.</P>
<P>Then passing a little forward, you discover the River <HI>Manghafia,</HI> able to bear good Ships; at the Mouth being twenty four degrees and a half, and taking original out of the Mountain <HI>Siliva.</HI></P>
<P>Half a mile North Westward, glides the small River <HI>Harangazavah;</HI> and a mile and a half further, that of <HI>Monambalou;</HI> famous for the Rocks lying in its Mouth.</P>
<P>This Territory hath many Islands, full of rich Meadows fit for the Pastu∣ring of Cattel; and the Countrey round about very fertile in the producing all sorts of Provision, yielding to the curious eye a pleasant Prospect, surrounded

<P>By the Shore of the River <HI>Franshere,</HI> and the other Rivers, lie many Villages; the chiefest of which are, <HI>Franshere, Imanhal, Cokomabes, Andravoulle, Ambometanaba, Mazomamou, Imouze, Mazofoutouts, Hatare,</HI> and <HI>Fananghaa,</HI> besides a great number of others.</P>
<P>Eight Miles from Fort <HI>Dauphin,</HI> lies a Tract of Land call'd <HI>Vohitsmassian,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vohitsmassian.</NOTE> that is, <HI>The Lucky Mountain,</HI> by which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> formerly had a Fort, with seve∣ral Dwellings below it, and Gardens with all sorts of Provisions, but were at last surpriz'd and massacred by the Natives.</P>
<P>Four Miles from the beforenam'd Fort, lies a naked Mountain and other neighboring Hills, oftentimes digg'd by the <HI>French,</HI> in hopes to find Gold or Silver; but chiefly by a place where seven clear Springs rise one by another, and make a Brook, wherein they found many Stones mixt with a Clay or yel∣low Earth, full of white and black Clods shining like Silver; but being beaten and cleans'd, was found too light.</P>
<P>Thirty Fathom above the Springs, the Grass and other Plants have chang'd their natural Verdure into a fading yellow, which proceeds from the sulphur∣ous Vapors of inclos'd Minerals; but on the top of the Mountain, all things re∣main fresh and green: They say the <HI>Portuguese</HI> formerly at the foot of this Mountain towards the North, by digging, found Gold; but since their extirpa∣tion, the Great ones of the Countrey have fill'd up the place.</P>
<P>This Territory comprehends two sorts of people, <HI>viz. Whites,</HI> and <HI>Blacks;</HI> the first subdivided into three Clans, nam'd <HI>Rohandrians, Anakandrians,</HI> and <HI>Onzatsi;</HI> the last distinguish themselves into four Tribes, that is, <HI>Voadziri, Lohavohits, Ont∣sea,</HI> and <HI>Ondeves:</HI> The <HI>Whites</HI> which have come hither within these last hundred and fifty years, name themselves <HI>Zafferahimini,</HI> from the Mother of <HI>Mahomet</HI> call'd <HI>Himina;</HI> or as others, the Stock of <HI>Ramini,</HI> whom they account their Predecessors; or from <HI>Ramnaina,</HI> Wife of <HI>Rahourod,</HI> Father of <HI>Rahari</HI> and <HI>Rakouvatsi.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rohandrians</HI> are those out of which they choose their King, whom they call <HI>Ompiandrian,</HI> or <HI>Dian Bahouache;</HI> the whole number of them being the chief Nobility, and reverenc'd as Princes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Anakandrians</HI> are extracted from the Nobles, but Illegitimate, or else sprung from a <HI>Rohandrian</HI> Man and Woman, either the <HI>Blacks,</HI> the <HI>Anakandrians,</HI> or the <HI>Onzatsi:</HI> Those they intitle <HI>Ontampassemaka,</HI> that is, People of the Sand of <HI>Mecha,</HI> from whence they say they are come with the <HI>Rohandrians.</HI> These <HI>Ana∣kandrians</HI> have a reddish Skin, and wear long Hair, Curl'd like the <HI>Rohandrians:</HI> both these have the priviledge to slaughter any Cattel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Onzatsi</HI> being the meanest, have their Extract from the Bastards of <HI>Ana∣kandrians,</HI> or else from the Race of the Sea-men, which the <HI>Zafferamini,</HI> or their Predecessors <HI>Dian Rakoube,</HI> or <HI>Rakouvatsi,</HI> brought into this Countrey. These are also red of Skin, with curl'd Hair, but may not kill any Creature but Hens. These are all Fishers.</P>
<P>These People have neither Religion nor Temples,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> but they use a Custom of Sacrificing some Beasts; when they are Sick, or when they Plant or gather <HI>Ig∣names</HI> and Rice, or Circumcise their Children, begin a War, enter into a new built House, or Bury their Relations: The first Fruits of Beasts they offer first to the Devil, and then to God; naming the Devil first, <HI>Diaubilis Aminnan-habare,</HI> as if they would say, <HI>Lord Devil with God.</HI> This Superstition they have in∣herited from their Fore-fathers that were <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and blindly con∣tinued
<PB N="664" REF="414"/>therein by their Priests, or <HI>Ombiassa,</HI> great Cheaters and Liars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blacks,</HI> in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Oulon Mainthy,</HI> and <HI>Marinh,</HI> are of four sorts; <HI>Voadziri, Lohavohits, Ontsoa,</HI> and <HI>Ondeves.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Voadziri,</HI> the greatest and richest, possessing some Villages, derive them∣selves from the first Progenitors of this Countrey, before the <HI>Whites,</HI> or <HI>Zaffe∣raminies</HI> came thither; but afterwards subjected by them. They have the Priviledge to cut the Cattels Throats, which belong to themselves or their Slaves, when they are far from the <HI>Zafferamini,</HI> or there be no <HI>Rohandrian</HI> or <HI>Ana∣kandrian</HI> in their Villages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lohavohits</HI> are also Grandees amongst the <HI>Blacks,</HI> and Off-springs of the <HI>Voadziri;</HI> but the difference between them consists in this, That the former Commands over a Countrey, and the other scarce hath the Rule of a small Village. They may not (as some report) cut an Ox or Cows Throat, though they are his own; but must go and fetch an <HI>Rohandrian,</HI> or <HI>Anakandrian,</HI> to do it: Notwithstanding some of them have a thousand Head of Cattel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ontsoa</HI> are under the <HI>Lohavohits,</HI> and their near Relations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ondeves,</HI> the meanest of all (as their Name imports, <HI>Ondeve</HI> signifying <HI>A lost Man</HI>) are Slaves both by the Fathers and Mothers side, or else bought, or taken in the Wars. When the <HI>Anakandrians, Ondzatsi,</HI> or <HI>Voadziri,</HI> and <HI>Ontsoa,</HI> die, they can leave nothing to their Children, because the Grandees or Great ones under whose Jurisdiction they stand, take all; onely they possess the Ground to Plant on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Voadziri, Lohavohits,</HI> and <HI>Ontsoa,</HI> may at their pleasure submit themselves to some Great Lord, upon the Decease of their King; for which Submission they receive a Gift from the same Lord, which intitles him after they die, to inherit all they possess. The <HI>Ondeves</HI> dare not forsake their Masters, except it be in a time of dearth, or for hunger, and that he denies them Sustenance; in which Case they may freely go to other Masters.</P>
<P>The Countrey of <HI>Anossi</HI> is under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>French;</HI> but was Govern'd by the <HI>Zaffaramini,</HI> or <HI>Rahimine,</HI> before the <HI>French</HI> had taken it, under a Prince whom they honor not as a King, but as a God. He was call'd <HI>Andi∣an Ramach,</HI> and after this death succeeded by <HI>Andian Maroarive,</HI> who had been a <HI>Christian,</HI> Baptiz'd in <HI>Choa,</HI> brought up by the Jesuits, and kept by the Viceroy of <HI>Goa;</HI> till at length return'd to his Countrey, and deliver'd into the Hands of his Father <HI>Andian Thianban.</HI> He was well instructed in the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and could Read and Write after the <HI>European</HI> Fashion, spoke good <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and could give a Rational Account of his Faith; but as soon as he came to see his Father, he betook himself to his former Heathenism. He was kill'd by a Musket-Bullet at the Siege of the Village <HI>Franshere,</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI> where he had his abode.</P>

<HEAD>The Fort of DAUPHIN in ANOSSI.</HEAD>
<P>ON the outmost Point of the South-East side, close by the Shore, about the year Sixteen hundred forty four, the <HI>French</HI> began to strengthen themselves with a Fort, which (in Honor of their Kings Eldest Son) they entituled <HI>Dauphin;</HI> and to settle a Plantation of People, which brought
<PB N="665" REF="414"/>almost the whole Territory under their Subjection by force of Arms.</P>
<P>In the year Sixteen hundred forty two, a <HI>French</HI> Sea-Captain, nam'd <HI>Ricault,</HI> got leave and priviledge for himself and his Participants, of the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> then Chief Supervisor of the <HI>French</HI> Affairs, That he might alone send Ships and People to this Island of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and the adjacent Isles, to erect a Colony for Merchandizing there, for the benefit of Trade, and to take Pos∣session of the whole in the Name of the King of <HI>France.</HI> This being granted him for ten Years, with exclusion of all others, a Company was erected by the Undertakers, under the name of the <HI>East-India French Company;</HI> and shortly af∣ter the King augmented their Term unto the year Sixteen hundred sixty one.</P>
<P>In that Year, in the Moneth of <HI>March,</HI> the Company first sent out one Ship, under the Command of Captain <HI>Coquet,</HI> to fetch Ebony-wood: With him there were also sent two Commissioners, call'd <HI>Pronis</HI> and <HI>Foukenburgh,</HI> with twelve others, to remain there, and expect the coming of a Ship which should set out of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>November. Coquet</HI> landed about <HI>September;</HI> and in his Sailing by, he put in for the Islands of <HI>Maskarrigne</HI> and <HI>Diego de Rois,</HI> of which <HI>Pronis</HI> took pos∣session in the King's Name; then Sail'd over to <HI>St. Maries,</HI> and the Bay of <HI>Antongill,</HI> in the Countrey-Language call'd <HI>Manghabe,</HI> where they did the same: But <HI>Foukenburgh</HI> and <HI>Pronis</HI> remained in the Haven of <HI>St. Lucie,</HI> or <HI>Manghafia.</HI> The first of <HI>April</HI> the Ship <HI>St. Laurence</HI> arriv'd, being sent thither by the Compa∣ny, under the Command of Captain <HI>Giles Rozimont,</HI> whilst Captain <HI>Coquet</HI> was gone to seek a Lading in the Territory of <HI>Anossi</HI> and <HI>Matatane. Rozimont</HI> brought along with him seventy fresh Men from <HI>Pronis,</HI> which all fell sick, and so conti∣nued about a Moneth at <HI>Manghafia,</HI> a third part of which quickly died; where∣upon the Black Inhabitants made an Attempt upon the new-arriv'd <HI>French,</HI> but were bought off, with Presents given by <HI>Pronis</HI> to the <HI>Dian Ramach:</HI> Afterward <HI>Pronis</HI> sent twelve <HI>French</HI> to take their abode in the Territory of <HI>Mantane,</HI> at a Place call'd <HI>Mananzari,</HI> partly to Trade for Rice and other Provisions, and part∣ly to discover the Countrey: But in their going over a River, six of them were kill'd by <HI>Zare Ramehina,</HI> a near Relation to <HI>Dian Ramach:</HI> In like manner, in <HI>Bohitsmene</HI> six Sea-men of Captain <HI>Rozimont's,</HI> with his Son, were slain as they were loading of Ebony-wood.</P>
<P><HI>Rozimont</HI> at last laded so much Ebony-wood as he could, and brought over the six other <HI>French</HI> to <HI>Anossi,</HI> to <HI>Pronis;</HI> for <HI>Pronis</HI> had in the mean while chang'd his Habitation, and was gone from <HI>St. Lucies,</HI> or <HI>Maghafia,</HI> to <HI>Anossi</HI> to take his Residence with all his People in <HI>Tholonghare Bay,</HI> near the before-mention'd Fort <HI>Dauphin;</HI> this place being by them judg'd the fittest and convenientest, partly for the commodiousness of the Haven, defended from the worst Winds, and partly for the easiness in coming to it, not only for Sloops, but also for Ships.</P>
<P>The Fort <HI>Dauphin</HI> lieth next the Bay of <HI>Tholangre,</HI> in five and twenty Degrees and six Minutes South Latitude, over against the Cape of <HI>Itapere,</HI> situate four Degrees higher.</P>
<P>Behind the Fort stand several Habitations, among which the House of the <HI>French</HI> Governor, with a great Garden, planted with all sorts of Pot-herbs and Fruits: But in the year Sixteen hundred fifty six, this Fort was burn'd down by accident; yet immediately rebuilt, and a good Garrison plac'd therein.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> maintain great Wars against the Inhabitants of the neighboring Territories, marching into the Mountains, burning down their Huts and Vil∣lages, and taking away their Cattel.</P>
<PB N="666" REF="415"/>
<P>In the year Sixteen hundred fifty one, <HI>Flacourd</HI> being then Commander in Chief for the <HI>French</HI> King, with forty <HI>French,</HI> and as many <HI>Negroes,</HI> arm'd with Shields and Lances, destroy'd the Countrey of <HI>Franhere,</HI> and laid all the Huts and Houses in Ashes, carrying away many Cows and Oxen, and both Men and Women; so that by this means all the Glory of the <HI>Roandrians</HI> came to nothing.</P>
<P>This cruel Usage rais'd in the Inhabitants a mortal hatred against the <HI>French;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hatred of the Inhabi∣tants against the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> increased afterwards by the selling of some Men and Women Slaves, by their Governor <HI>Pronis,</HI> to the <HI>Netherland</HI> Governor of the Island <HI>Mauritius.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> yet give themselves over wholly to Superstition, and Sorcery, as an effect thereof, giving credit to Charmes and Characters written after the <HI>Arabian</HI> fashion, which they call <HI>Hiridri, Masarabou,</HI> and <HI>Talissimou.</HI> They imagine some of these able to prevent Thunder, Rain, Wind, and Wounds gotten in the Wars; and likewise as Preservatives against Poyson; good Defences against Robbing, and Burning of their Houses and Vil∣lages; in short, infallible Remedies against all Misfortunes. All these Charms the <HI>Ombiassen,</HI> a Gallimaufry of Priests, Astrologers, and Southsayers, make and sell to the meaner sort of <HI>Blacks,</HI> which wear the same about their Necks, and sew'd in their Girdles. They cut the same Characters also on Gold, Silver, and small flat pieces of Reed for the same purpose.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are two sorts, <HI>Zaffekasimambou,</HI> or <HI>Casimambou,</HI> the chiefest; and <HI>Zafferahmina,</HI> both <HI>Whites,</HI> but the first more deform'd, although generally Priests, and Learned-men.</P>
<P>About thirty or five and thirty years ago, all the <HI>Zafferahimina</HI> were kill'd, except Women and Children; to whom the Conquerors gave some Islands and Fields to Inhabit; on which they Planted and fed their Cattel, and are ever since call'd <HI>Ontampassemaci,</HI> which is to say, People of the Sand of <HI>Mecha,</HI> because they are <HI>Arabians</HI> of the Red-Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Casimambou</HI> put in for this Island (by their own relation) by the directi∣ons and Command of the <HI>Califf</HI> of <HI>Mecha,</HI> to instruct the Islanders in <HI>Mahomets</HI> Superstition, about a hundred and sixty years ago: At which time, their Chief Governor Married the Daughter of a great Lord, and Prince of <HI>Matatam,</HI> a <HI>Ne∣gro;</HI> with condition, that her Issue, Male or Female, should be call'd after his Daughters name <HI>Casimambou,</HI> as is usual on the South side of this Island, and al∣so in <HI>Mactricore.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Zaffekasimombou</HI> are mightily increas'd in number, and teach to Read and Write <HI>Arabick,</HI> keeping Schools in all the Villages for the Youth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ontampassimaci</HI> live by Fishing, wherein they employ their whole time; and have arriv'd to a wonderful dexterity therein.</P>
<P>Next the River <HI>Matatam</HI> lie along the Sea Coast many others; as <HI>Manghasiouts, Manangkare, Mananhane, Itin, Itapaulobei, Itapoulosirire,</HI> and <HI>Itapaulomaint-hiranou, Fo∣nara, Lomahorik,</HI> or <HI>Morombei,</HI> and the <HI>Mantaraven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Manghasiouts,</HI> or <HI>Manghasies,</HI> is an indifferent River, three small Miles from <HI>Matatam;</HI> on whose Shore the <HI>French</HI> have a Factory, but dangerous to come to with a Boat, by reason of the Rocks and Shelves that clog it.</P>

<P>Three Miles from <HI>Galemboulou,</HI> a very fair and great River pours its self into the Sea; wherein they say the small Island <HI>Ambouluossi</HI> shews it self.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Manangharou</HI> running from West to East,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of <HI>Manang∣harou.</HI></NOTE> divides its self near the Sea Coast into four distinct Channels; of which it self being one, retains its name from the Original to the Mouth: The other three are, <HI>Manansatran,</HI> the second <HI>Marinhou,</HI> opposite to the Island <HI>Nosti Ibrahim,</HI> or <HI>St. Mary;</HI> and lastly, the Stream <HI>Jamiami,</HI> a great and spacious River, which at its Outlet into the Sea, al∣ways holds seven or eight Foot Water.</P>

<P>It lieth in fifteen degrees South-Latitude, stretching Northward, and about six Miles broad.

<P>At the entrance of the Bay, are three or four other small Islands, either Sown with Rice, or full of Weeds.</P>
<PB N="673" REF="418"/>
<P>On the North side, are three populous Towns, with several other along the Shore; neighbor'd by a great River, which divided into two Arms, the one running to the North, the other to the West; making in the middle at the parting an Island.</P>
<P>Further on to the North appears another great Town, call'd by the <HI>Portuguese St. Angelo,</HI> surrounded with a strong Pallisado: Opposite to which on the left hand another, which the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in their first Voyage to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred ninety five named <HI>Spakenburgh,</HI> consisting of about a hundred and eighty Houses: West South-West from the foremention'd Island, glides another River, upon which a Town lieth.</P>
<P>The Grounds are exceeding good and fat, well water'd, and full of Grass,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Condition of the Land.</NOTE> but not over-stockt with Cattel, the richest Person having scarce a Herd of four and twenty Beasts.</P>
<P>The Towns here shew more of Architecture than usual in these parts, and advantageously Seated, either upon the Mountains, or along the River, Fen∣ced with Stakes; with two Entrances or Doors, onely the one to the Water, the other to the side of a Wood, for their flight thither, when set upon by the Enemy and worsted.</P>
<P>All the People from the <HI>Plum-Haven</HI> to <HI>Antongil-Bay,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs.</NOTE> observe the same Cu∣stoms, and all name themselves one among another, <HI>Zaffehibrahim,</HI> that is, <HI>The Generation of Abraham;</HI> or <HI>Nossi Abrahim,</HI> from the Island <HI>Abraham,</HI> whence they are sprung.</P>
<P>By their keeping holy the Saturday, their whiteness of colour, and some other particular Customs, <HI>Flaccourt</HI> thinks them to be descended from the Stock of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> who fled thither many years ago.</P>
<P>Both Men, Women, and Children are whiter than those of <HI>Matatane</HI> and <HI>An∣drobeisaha,</HI> with smooth Hair hanging down at length; being good natur'd, mild, and hospitable, not inclin'd to Robbery or Murther.</P>
<P>In Dancing and Singing, they seem to use some kinds of measures; Footing it in pairs, sometimes making distinct stops, and stretching out their Arms.</P>
<P>All their Songs consist of Epithalamiums; in the Chanting whereof they use odd Postures, and all the by-standers keep time by clapping of hands, which they call <HI>Manghovah,</HI> that is, <HI>Keeping,</HI> as if they should say they would keep time.</P>
<P>Men and Women, when they have any sickness in their Eyes or Head, they anoint their Faces, sometimes with white, sometimes with black, red or yellow Colours: But old Women use that kind of Painting to make them seem the more lively and youthful.</P>
<P>The Women and Maids have an observant and strict eye held over them, so that a man cannot without difficulty be permitted access to them.</P>
<P>They are very diligent in Husbandry: In the morning before Sun-rise,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Employment.</NOTE> go∣ing to the Rice-Fields, from whence they return not till Sun-set.</P>
<P>The Men cut up Canes, call'd by the <HI>Indians, Bambu,</HI> and here <HI>Voulou,</HI> which being dry'd they set on fire, and then lay the ashes as Compost upon the ground to inrich it; after that the Women and Girles set the Rice, Grain by Grain, making a hole in the Earth with a Stick, into which the Grain being cast, they fill it up.</P>
<P>The Seed-time (as we may call it) being over, they sever the Rice from the Weeds, and carry the ripe Corn from the Field into the Barns. In the mean time, while the Women are busie at their labour, the Men begin in other pla∣ces
<PB N="674" REF="419"/>to cut up and burn; for as soon as they see the first Sown Rice come up, they set another Crop immediately; so that they continually labour, and have the whole year through Rice in the Leaf, in the Blossom, and in the Ear. The same they do with all other Dressings and Plantings.</P>
<P>Here you must take notice, that the Canes or <HI>Bambu</HI> beforemention'd, in burning makes so great a noise, that may be heard at a great distance, as if a multitude of Ordnance, Muskets, and Pistols were shot off together.</P>
<P>The Merchandize which the <HI>French</HI> sell to the <HI>Galemboulle,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches.</NOTE> serveth them not for Ornament or wearing, but they keep it up as a Treasure, and buy Cattel with it in the Countrey of <HI>Ansianackte</HI> and the Mountains of <HI>Ambohitsmene.</HI></P>
<P>They find little Gold among those of <HI>Galemboulle,</HI> but some quantities of Sil∣ver, and that reddish, course, and unrefin'd, or of a base allay.</P>
<P>These people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> and all the <HI>Zaffehibrahims,</HI> keep the Saturday holy, as we hin∣ted before. They do not acknowledge <HI>Mahomet,</HI> but call all the <HI>Mahumetans, Caf∣fers:</HI> they reverence <HI>Noah, Abraham, Moses,</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> but take no notice of the other Prophets, nor of Christ, and hold Circumcision. They observe no Fasts, nor have any Law or Worship, neither know what it is to pray to God, though nevertheless they offer Sacrifices of Oxen, Cows, and Goats. They have no Temples, or other places of Worship or Assembly, but <HI>Amounouques</HI> or Burying-places of their Fore-fathers, to whose memory they shew great reverence; by all which, they seem to have some little Reliques of <HI>Judaism.</HI> They are so great∣ly addicted to their own Customs, that they will rather die of hunger, than eat of a Beast or Fowl kill'd by any Christian, or one of the Southern Coast.</P>
<P>All the Children born on a Tuesday, Thursday, or Fryday, they bring into the Woods, and lay down as untimely Fruits, for to perish by cold or hunger, or be devour'd by the wild Beasts; although sometime by one or other of the Wo∣men, out of tenderness and compassion, taken up and suckled.</P>
<P>Every Village hath a peculiar Lord,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Fi∣loubei,</HI> who administers Justice to the People; and the eldest takes upon him as a Judge to decide all differences. They assist and aid one another in the Wars, but if any of the <HI>Filoubei</HI> quarrel, all the rest interpose as Mediators, who take up and moderate the Controversie; but if they will not hearken, they leave them to decide it by Arms, sitting neutral Spectators.</P>
<P>These people use their Slaves more like Children than what they are, inso∣much that they esteem them as Sons, admitting them to eat at their Tables, and not seldom bestowing their Daughters upon them for Wives.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have formerly frequented this Bay, to buy Rice and Slaves; and some years ago began to grow numerous, till the unwholesomness of the Air kill'd many; and the Lords of the Countrey, either by open force, or clan∣destine practises, weary'd out and destroy'd the rest.</P>
<P>This is all that hitherto could be known concerning this Island, at the South East and East side; for from the <HI>Bay of Antongil</HI> to the North end, little disco∣very hath yet been made by the people of <HI>Europe;</HI> onely we have heard of a Territory call'd <HI>Vohemaro,</HI> and in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Sea-Cards set down by the name of <HI>Boamaro,</HI> inhabited by <HI>White</HI> People.

<P>This Countrey the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Terra del Gada,</HI> that is, <HI>The Countrey of Cattel,</HI> from the vast Herds thereof breeding in it.</P>
<P>There are three other Rivers run towards the West, the one <HI>Sohavianh;</HI> the other <HI>Soumada;</HI> and the third, <HI>Manatangh,</HI> all flowing into a great <HI>Bay,</HI> in nine∣teen Degrees.</P>
<P>Higher to the Northward the <HI>French</HI> have hitherto little knowledge of this Island; and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have for these many years discover'd all upon the Sea-coast, except some few Places, as the Countrey, or <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Paxel,</HI> of <HI>St. An∣drew,
<PB N="678" REF="421"/>Cabo di Donna nostra Cunha, Rio de St. Andreas, Rio de Diego Soares,</HI> and lastly the <HI>Cape of St. Sebastian,</HI> the uttermost North-west Point of this Island.</P>
<P>We will proceed now to give you some account of the general state of the Island.</P>
<P>They find Iron and Steel in great abundance, which they work and cleanse with more ease and less labour than with us; for the Smiths take a Basket full of the Mineral, as they find it ready, and lay it upon red hot Coals between four Stones, set and closed about with Clay, and blown up with a pair of Bellows made in manner of a Wooden Pump; with which blowing, the Mineral within an hours time melts, and so drawn off and for∣ced into Bars, or Staves of three or four pound.</P>
<P>There are also, as they say, Mynes of Steel in the Territories of <HI>Mahafalle, Anachimoussi, Inourhon, Icondrean, Manamboulle;</HI> and in <HI>Amboulle, Anossi, Matatane,</HI> and <HI>Manghabei,</HI> good Iron. Silver is very common in these Countreys; yet hath none ever found there any Mynes either of Silver, Copper, Lead, or Tin.</P>
<P>They find Gold also among the Inhabitants,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minerals, or Mynes.</NOTE> not brought thither to them, but found every where in great plenty, and such as the <HI>Europeans</HI> have none of; they call it in their Countrey Language <HI>Voulamene Voutruroa,</HI> yet distinguish it into three sorts; the first their In-land Gold, or Gold of <HI>Malacasse,</HI> pale∣colour'd, and is pliable as Lead; an Ounce whereof is not worth ten Crowns. The second, Gold of <HI>Mecha,</HI> or <HI>Voulameneraca,</HI> which the <HI>Rohandrians</HI> brought with them out of their Countrey, it being very fine, and good <HI>Duckat</HI>-Gold. The third, that which the <HI>Christians</HI> have brought thither, being hardest to be melted, and by them is nam'd <HI>Voulamene Voutrouwa,</HI> as they say. The Gold of <HI>Malacasse</HI> was first found in the Countrey, of which there are Mynes in the Ter∣ritory of <HI>Anossi,</HI> and elsewhere, by the relation of the <HI>Blacks.</HI> The In-land Gold they divide into three sorts; one very fine, call'd <HI>Litteharonghe;</HI> the second less fine, styl'd <HI>Voulamene Sautehy;</HI> and a third ordinary, nam'd <HI>Ahets-Lovau.</HI></P>
<P>Precious Stones they find in the Rivers and Brooks of many kinds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Precious Stones.</NOTE> as Cry∣stal, Topazes, Granats, Amethysts, Eagles-stones, Smaragdines, or Emerauds, Saphyres, Jacinths, Jaspers, Agats, Blood-stones, (by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Rahamanghe,</HI> and by the Physitians in <HI>Greek, Haematifes</HI>) Cornelion, Toad-stones, and such like.</P>
<P>They find in several quarters of this Island divers sorts of Waters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Waters.</NOTE> some run∣ning above, and some under Ground, receiving a taste and quality according to the Mineral they participate of.</P>
<P>In the Valley of <HI>Amboulle</HI> ariseth a Spring with very hot Water, a powerful Medicine against Sicknesses growing from Cold in the Sinews: the same being drunk is a great Pectoral, and cures all Diseases of the Stomach, openeth ob∣structions in the Reins and Spleen, and expells the Stone and Gravel.</P>
<P>They have in many places Springs that taste like Iron; as near Fort <HI>Dauphin</HI> in <HI>Anossi,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Blacks</HI> therefore call the <HI>Iron-water.</HI></P>
<P>In a high Mountain in <HI>Amboulle</HI> are Fountains of salt Water (although thir∣ty Miles distant from the Sea,) whereof the Natives make Salt.</P>
<P><HI>Manghasia</HI> shews a Fountain upon a Hill, out of which issues <HI>Jews-Gumme.</HI> In the Precinct of <HI>Fanghaterre,</HI> Westward of <HI>Mount Hiela,</HI> are Brooks with white Water, that taste and smell like Brimstone.</P>
<P><HI>Houlouve,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four setts of Honey.</NOTE> and <HI>Vourouhehock,</HI> afford rich Salt-Petre Caves; which they name in general <HI>Tentele,</HI> and make-four sorts of it; Bee-Honey, call'd <HI>Voatentele;</HI> green
<PB N="679" REF="421"/><HI>Mesquite</HI>-Honey, by name <HI>Sih;</HI> and two sorts of Honey of Pismires, one of Fly∣ing Pismires, Swarming together in hollow Trees; and of other Pismires a little bigger, which make their Honey in <HI>Vontantames,</HI> that is, great Mole-hills sharp and copped above, every where boared through with Ant-holes. All these Honeys have a very sweet taste.</P>
<P>But besides these, they tell of two other sorts of Honey; one hard and sweet, more resembling Sugar than Honey, yet call'd <HI>Teutele Sacondre,</HI> made of the Leaves of a little Tree or Shrub, which at maturity turn into yellow, green, and red Husks; some hold this to be the <HI>Tabaxir</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> or Sugar of the <HI>Bomboes</HI> Cane, which yields rather an unpleasant than sweet taste.</P>
<P>There is yet another sort of Honey, said to be Venomous or Poysonous, yet made by Bees which suck it out of the Flowers of a Tree, bearing strong Poy∣son, and found in <HI>Carakarak,</HI> a member of <HI>Anossi.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants make three sorts of Wine; the first and commonest, of Ho∣ney; the second of Sugar, which they call <HI>Tovach,</HI> or <HI>Tovapare,</HI> being somewhat bitter of taste like new Beer, or as the Kernel of an Apricock, made in the Countreys of <HI>Manamboule, Matatane,</HI> and <HI>Hanghabei,</HI> by boyling the Sugar Canes in Water to the consumption of a third part, then putting it into great <HI>Calla∣bashes,</HI> it becomes Wine on the third day. This Wine hath such a corrosive qua∣lity, that put it into an Egg-shell, it will eat the same throrow in the space of one hour.</P>
<P>The third, some make of the great <HI>Bananoes</HI> Fruits, putting the same into a Vessel, and boyling it four or five hours, of which cometh a tartish Wine like Sider.</P>
<P>They have several sorts of Oil,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oile.</NOTE> with which both Men and Women anoint their Heads and Bodies; for want thereof they take Ox Suet mixt with Wax. The best known and ordinariest Oils are, <HI>Menachtanhe,</HI> (<HI>Menaen</HI> signifieth Oil) <HI>Menachil, Menachovivat, Monachmafoutra, Menach Voarave, Menach Apokopouk, Menach Vintag,</HI> and <HI>Menach Arame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Menach Tanhetanhe</HI> made of a Plant, in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Tanhe∣tanha;</HI> and by us, <HI>Tree of Wonder;</HI> and in Latin <HI>Ricinus; Minalchis</HI> Oil they make in the Valley of <HI>Amboulle,</HI> of a Fruit or Seed call'd <HI>Voankare;</HI> and in <HI>Europe, Sesamus: Menachouvivou</HI> they extract of a Fruit as big as an Almond, and hath a good taste both in Eating and Drinking: <HI>Menachmafoutra</HI> made of the Kernels of the Fruits of the Dragon-Tree; bears the same thickness as Oil of Nutmegs, but without smell; it cures Scabs, and dry Tetters: <HI>Voarave</HI> is drawn from the Fruit <HI>Fontsi: Menachfowaha,</HI> of the Fruit <HI>Apokapouk,</HI> being very Poysonous: <HI>Menach Vintag,</HI> of a great Acron: <HI>Menach Arame,</HI> of the Kernel of the Fruit of the Tree, from whence the Gum call'd <HI>Tacamahacha</HI> proceeds.</P>
<P>From hence Merchants bring divers sorts of Physical Earth, one red, (<HI>Tamene</HI> in their Speech) as good, if not the same with that, by the Apothecaries call'd <HI>Bole Armoniack:</HI> another call'd, <HI>Terra Sigillata,</HI> Sealed Earth; that properly so named, brought from the Island of <HI>Lemnos,</HI> and therefore also call'd <HI>Terra Lem∣nia;</HI> yet according to <HI>Flakourt,</HI> that of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> no less esteem'd than the other, and among the Natives call'd <HI>Tavelisse.</HI> A third like Chalk, excellent to wash Linen in stead of Sope, being a fat Clay, like the Earth of <HI>Malta;</HI> which they say, carry'd about one, hath power to kill or drive away Snakes or Serpents, or at least, to resist their Poyson; the Vulgar name there is <HI>Tanefoutchi.</HI></P>
<P>They have great variety of Gums, known by the general name <HI>Lite;</HI> some well scented, and others without any smell: Of these we will reckon first <HI>Lite∣menta,</HI>
<PB N="680" REF="422"/>or <HI>Benjoin, Literame,</HI> or <HI>Taccamahacca: Lite Fimpi,</HI> a pleasant scented Gum. <HI>Lite-Enfouraha,</HI> a kind of green Rosin, with a Balsom-like smell: <HI>Quizominthi,</HI> a black Gum, which serves to Glue the Handles to their <HI>Assagays: Hingue,</HI> a black well scented Gum: <HI>Litimithsi,</HI> black like <HI>Jah;</HI> very drawing, but quick∣ly grows dry and hard; yet the Women use it to Gum their Faces, to prevent Wrinkles; it heals also Wounds and Sores. <HI>Litin Bitsik,</HI> Gum made by the Pis∣mires in the Territory of <HI>Ampatre;</HI> is white, and hangs on a small Branch of a Tree, inclosing within it small Pismires: <HI>Falanoue,</HI> that is, Musk, cometh from a Creature as big as a Cat: <HI>Litineha</HI> is our Dragons Bloods: <HI>Litin Barenko∣ko,</HI> another sort of Dragons Blood: <HI>Latinpane,</HI> well scented Rosin, of the Tree <HI>Fane: Vahonlitintang,</HI> the Sap or Juice of the Tree, <HI>Vintang,</HI> or <HI>Aloe: Litingharon∣ga,</HI> a yellow Gum, like <HI>Gutta Gambu,</HI> coming from a Tree, out of whose Blos∣soms the Bees gather a delicious Honey.</P>
<P>Nature hath also stor'd this Island with many kinds of Plants, as well for Food as Physick; as first the nutrimental are these:</P>
<P>Rice of two sorts, the one call'd in the Countrey phrase <HI>Varemanghe,</HI> and the other <HI>Vatomandre:</HI> The first being of four sorts, two of them are Bearded and very white; the other two sorts Bearded, with a red Shell, that turns russet when it is boyl'd.</P>
<P>The Rice <HI>Vatomandre</HI> grows never but in Winter; is smaller than the other, and sowrish of taste.</P>
<P>The Rice <HI>Varehondre,</HI> differenc'd onely by the name.</P>
<P>Another sort of Rice, call'd from <HI>Varemanghe,</HI> because Planted in the Sum∣mer to be Reaped in the Winter, yields not so much as the other; neither is it Planted, but in a scarcity of other Rice, or when the Grashoppers or Locusts have eaten up the former Crop.</P>
<P>There they have divers sorts of <HI>Ignamoe</HI> Roots,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roots.</NOTE> which they all call with the general name of <HI>Ouvi,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Ouviharen, Soabei, Kambares, Ouvifouthi, Offe∣qua, Mauondre, Valeue, Randre,</HI> and <HI>Damborn.</HI> The <HI>Ouifoutchi</HI> are the best and dear∣est; after these follow the <HI>Soabei,</HI> which are white; then the <HI>Kambares,</HI> some of a Pink colour, and some white; very acceptable in the taste. The <HI>Ouifoutchi</HI> grow very big in fat ground, some to the thickness of a mans middle, which being hang'd on a Pole, two <HI>Negros</HI> have enough to do to carry: but the or∣dinary ones are as thick as a mans Leg, whereof a hundred, or a hundred and fifty, buy an Ox: The <HI>Soabei</HI> are not half so great: The <HI>Kambares</HI> and <HI>Ouvihare</HI> are of one bigness, and a hundred and fifty given for a hundred <HI>Ouifoutchi.</HI> One piece of the <HI>Ouifantochi</HI> planted in the ground, produces sometimes two others, but commonly but one; but one piece of the <HI>Kambares</HI> and <HI>Ouvihare</HI> produces commonly three or four others: The <HI>Ouvihare</HI> are the smallest and cheapest, yet well tasted, and flourish better than the rest; whereof the Slaves make their best repasts.</P>
<P>The Root <HI>Offeque,</HI> also a sort of <HI>Ignames,</HI> or <HI>Ouvi,</HI> hath a bitter taste, which therefore the <HI>Islanders</HI> steep and boyl to take away the acerbitie before they sell it. The <HI>Negros</HI> are very desirous of them, insomuch, that after they have boyl'd them as before, they dry them in the Sun, till they grow as hard as Wood, that they may keep them a year or two without spoiling or rot∣ting.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mavandre,</HI> a pleasant tasted Root, whereof one hath commonly ten or twelve distinctions, but no bigger than a Hens Egg, somewhat resemble Ches∣nuts, but mellower, and hurtful to the Stomach.</P>
<PB N="681" REF="422"/>
<P>The <HI>Valeue,</HI> differs little from the <HI>Soabei</HI> and <HI>Oviharen.</HI></P>
<P>There are besides these Planted several other, which grow of themselves; as <HI>Ouvi-enpasso, Ouvi-randre, Ouvi-dambou, Fanghits, Vahalaye, Fandre, Hombouk,</HI> and others, which in time of Famine are sought for in the Fields and Woods.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ouvi-enpasso</HI> are very thick and long Roots, and as pleasant to be eaten when they are ripe as the <HI>Carembares;</HI> they grow in the Woods by the Sea side.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ouvi-randres</HI> are small Roots, of the thickness of a Raddish, with a long Leaf, growing in Pools.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ouvi-dambou</HI> is a Root, whose Leaves are like those of a Vine, very un∣pleasing, and hard of digestion; so that they seldom eat it but in the time of Famine.</P>
<P><HI>Vohalaye</HI> grows as thick as a mans head, with an ash-colour'd Shell; and is eaten both raw and boyl'd.</P>
<P><HI>Fanghits,</HI> are Roots with a Rosie colour'd outside, and exceeding large; very sweet of taste, but not so acceptable as the <HI>Vahalaye:</HI> They satisfie both hunger and thirst, are eaten raw, being of easie concoction, expelling watry humors; they grow under Thorn Hedges.</P>
<P>The Roots <HI>Fandre</HI> and <HI>Hombouk,</HI> are well tasted, and taken for good Food by the <HI>Ompilamyces</HI> and <HI>Ompeerees,</HI> which neither Sow nor Plant.</P>
<P><HI>Sonres</HI> have round Leaves, so broad, that a man may stand under and shel∣ter himself from Rain: These Leaves with Meat eat like Cabbage; but the Root tastes as well as the Pulp in the Stalk of a Artichoke.</P>
<P><HI>Houmines,</HI> or <HI>Voamitsa,</HI> resemble a Turnip, one Plant will yield in a year above a hundred Roots.</P>
<P>They have three sorts of Water-Lillies, with Pink, White, and Yellow Flow∣ers; the Roots of all which are eaten boyl'd and roasted, as we use Chesnuts. The Root of the Pink-colour'd, call'd <HI>Fantamou,</HI> give a very sweet relish, which both men and Women feed on with great appetite, as a strong Provocation to <HI>Venus;</HI> whereas the Root of the White, or <HI>Lazelaze;</HI> and the Yellow, <HI>Talifouk,</HI> prevents and hinders Love affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Geirst</HI> or <HI>Ampembe,</HI> grows there to the height of a Pike, and is ripe in <HI>June.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Voangbe</HI> are small Beans, which both green and ripe have a pleasing savour, but lie heavy in the Stomach; being Sown in <HI>June,</HI> they grow ripe in three Moneths.</P>
<P><HI>Voandsourou,</HI> are small Pease, no bigger than Tares.</P>
<P><HI>Antah,</HI> a sort of good <HI>Roman</HI> Beans.</P>
<P><HI>Voandre,</HI> another sort of Beans, but bearing their Fruits under ground, having in each Husk onely one Bean: Perhaps the <HI>Arachidna</HI> of <HI>Theophrastus;</HI> the Leaves sit by threes, like those of Clover-Grass, but without other Branches or Stalks than those of the Leaves.</P>
<P><HI>Varuattes,</HI> otherwise <HI>Ambarvatsi,</HI> is a Tree like the <HI>Spanish</HI> Caper-tree, and blos∣soms in the same manner, bearing a Cod or Husk, in which lieth inclos'd a small and well tasted Grain: It grows to the heighth of a Cherty Tree, and some give the Leaves to Silk Worms to feed on.</P>
<P>There grow also in many places <HI>Bananasses,</HI> some larger, and some less, ac∣counted good Victuals; and when ripe, eaten roasted like Apples; many times they gather the green and unripe Branches, which hang'd in the roofs of their Houses, ripen in five or six days. In <HI>Eringdrane</HI> they make Thred of the Bark of this Tree, to be worn into Clothes.</P>
<PB N="682" REF="423"/>
<P><HI>Akondre</HI> a small Fruit, whereof one Bush bears above a hundred, and whe∣ther young or old, they are of a green colour, but the Root esteem'd the best Food.</P>
<P><HI>Ananassen,</HI> by the Islanders of <HI>St. Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Bay of Antongil,</HI> call'd <HI>Manassi,</HI> grow there in great abundance; but those on the Islands are better than by the Fort of <HI>Dauphin.</HI></P>
<P>Water-Melons, with them call'd <HI>Voamanghe,</HI> are of two sorts, one with black, and the other with red Kernels, but both of them very good to abate thirst.</P>
<P>Likewise <HI>Vontanges,</HI> or Musk-Melons, like our Citrons, but neither of these are natural Products; the Seed being first of all brought thither from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Voatane</HI> are of two sorts, long and round; the long, though not fully ripe, they boyl and eat with Milk and other Victuals, but the dry'd ones serve them for Flasks.</P>
<P>Sugar-Canes, call'd <HI>Fare,</HI> grow there almost without number, especially in <HI>Matatane, Manamboulle, Antavare, Ghalemboule,</HI> and the Island of <HI>St. Mary;</HI> of which much Sugar might be made, if the Inhabitants understood that Art; but they extract a strong Wine of them, at the first not very pleasing, nor will it remain good above three days; and besides, hath such a corroding quality, that being kept from Morning to Evening in a Stone Cup, it will eat the same thorow; which the strongest Juyce of Lemon cannot do.</P>
<P><HI>Vanto</HI> grows upon a thick Tree at the Sea side; which being ripe, the In∣habitants either eat alone, or with Milk and Salt. The Wood of it proves ve∣ry firm, and fit for Building.</P>
<P><HI>Vantaka,</HI> a Fruit as big as an ordinary Apple, hath a hard Shell, within full of flat Kernels, whose ripe and pulpy substance, pleases two Senses, the Taste, and the Smelling, though green, contrary to both; and besides hurtful to the Stomach. This Fruit, <HI>Garzias</HI> calls the Queen-Apple; and <HI>K. Durant, Marmelos de Bengala,</HI> whereof they say a Liquor may be made like Beer, but causing a Flux of the Belly.</P>
<P><HI>Voarots</HI> is a Fruit of a great Tree, with Leaves like those of an Olive, very sowre, and as big as a Cherry, with a black Shell like a Nut, of which there are three sorts, white, red, and black.</P>
<P><HI>Voaverone,</HI> a Pink-colour'd Fruit, very sweet and acceptable to the Palate. In Dying it gives a tincture of Black and Violet.</P>
<P><HI>Voahelats,</HI> a kind of Mulberry, in the likeness both of Leaves and Fruit, but so sharp and sowre of taste, that it fetches the skin off from the Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Azorualala,</HI> a small red Fruit, well tasted, thick, like a red Mulberry, but not juicy, grows on small Trees under Hedges.</P>
<P><HI>Voatsoutre,</HI> a small thick Fruit, like a Nutmeg, but relishes when boyl'd or roasted like a Chesnut.</P>
<P><HI>Tacanhoca,</HI> a Fruit which causes Dogs to die. The Tree whereon they grow shoots up very high, and hath Wood exceeding hard, of a Mouse-colour: The Leaves resemble those of the Almond-Tree, but indented with five or six cuts, at each of which grows a Flower of the same colour, but without Scent, which afterward changes into a Fruit that stands round about the edges of the Leaves.</P>
<P><HI>Voanane,</HI> a Fruit half a Foot long, and proves a powerful Medicine against a Loosness.</P>
<P><HI>Ensasacale,</HI> the Fruit of a great Tree, shooting up very streight, with few
<PB N="683" REF="423"/>Branches, is long like that of the Pipe <HI>Cassia,</HI> and so divided into small Partiti∣ons; the colour without and within yellow, full of Seed, and containing some well-scented Juice; it grows neither on the Branches nor Leaves, but on the Bark, round about the body of the Tree, from the top to the bottom, and is of three sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> first the foremention'd, then are other blacker above, and the third of an ash-colour'd white.</P>
<P><HI>Fonti,</HI> otherwise <HI>Dourou,</HI> shoots up like a Plume of Feathers, with Leaves re∣sembling Falls a Foot long, and two Foot broad; some more.</P>
<P>The Fruit <HI>Voatfonsi,</HI> or <HI>Voadourou,</HI> grows like the Date, or <HI>Bananos</HI>-Trees, but in a hard Shell; every Grain resembles a great Pease, cover'd about with blew Skin; of which they make Oyl, as the Meal of it they eat with Milk. This Fruit, with the Leaves of <HI>Retel,</HI> and a little Chalk, the Inhabitants conti∣nually chew for their healths sake, and to preserve a sweet Breath. The dry Leaves they call <HI>Rattes;</HI> the Stalks, <HI>Falaffes;</HI> and use them about their Houses, because they will keep six years without decaying. The green Leaves serve them for Mats, Trenchers, and Drinking-Cups.</P>
<P><HI>Hamouton</HI> resembles and tastes like a black Plum, but hath no Stone, but in stead thereof ten or twelve Kernels; by the <HI>French</HI> call'd (from the abun∣dance of the Fruit there growing on the Haven) <HI>Le Pourt aux Prunes,</HI> that is, <HI>Plum-Haven.</HI> There is another sort of <HI>Alamoutou,</HI> call'd <HI>Issaye,</HI> like great Sloes, but hath the taste of Figs, with some small Kernels within. The over-eating of this Fruit breeds a pain in the Stomach.</P>
<P>Sweet and sowre Granates, call'd <HI>Voacomani,</HI> grow ripe in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>Octo∣ber:</HI> Also small Oranges, nam'd <HI>Voang Hissaye,</HI> of a sweet taste, and no bigger than a Plum, and hang ten or twelve on a Stalk.</P>
<P>Citrons, by a general name call'd <HI>Vousara,</HI> are of seven sorts; some sweet, and very large, which they call <HI>Vousa-remami;</HI> another ordinary sort, call'd <HI>Voasecats,</HI> sowre and small like a Plum; two other taste like a Mussle-plum, and are denominated <HI>Voatoulong,</HI> the one are great, and the other small; ano∣ther <HI>Voutrimon,</HI> with a thick Shell, grows to the bigness of a Childs Head: The Shell of this and the <HI>Voatoulong</HI> is good to preserve.</P>
<P><HI>Ravensara</HI> is a great and high Tree like a Lawrel, and with such Leaves, but less.</P>
<P>The Fruit <HI>Varvensara</HI> resembles a green Walnut, but tastes (as well the Shell as Kernel and Leaves) like a Clove. The Tree bears no Fruit till the third year; and when the Inhabitants desire to have these Fruits and Leaves (which they boyl with Ginger, Garlick, and Fish,) they climb not up the Tree, but cut it down by the Roots: it grows on high Mountains, and there are Males and Females of them.</P>
<P>Right white Pepper may be had there in such abundance, that a great Ships Lading might be carry'd from them every year; it comes to maturity in <HI>Au∣gust, September,</HI> and <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cardamoms</HI> also grow towards the side of the Territory of <HI>Galemboulou,</HI> and are in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Longouze,</HI> otherwise <HI>Melegette,</HI> and Grain, having a black Seed, yielding a Spicy taste.</P>
<P>Likewise very good Ginger call'd <HI>Sacaviro,</HI> but according to <HI>Flaccourt,</HI> not in any great quantities; though <HI>Francis Couche</HI> affirms that it grows all over the Island, and that the Islanders Plant that alone round about their Houses to catch the Rain falling on its Branches; and likewise about the Hives for a Food to the Bees. There grows yet another sort on the Mountains,
<PB N="684" REF="424"/>call'd <HI>Sacaviro d' Ambou,</HI> that is, <HI>Mountain of Ginger,</HI> taken by <HI>Flaccourt</HI> for <HI>Zedoary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coco</HI>-Nut, by them call'd <HI>Vianiou,</HI> are very scarce, and were not known to them in former times; but as they were brought from other Places, since the Year Fifty or Sixty, and that by chance many were thrown up by the Sea on the Shore, which is not without great probability, because from time to time there are <HI>Coco</HI>-Nuts found on the Sea-shore.</P>
<P>Moreover <HI>Indian</HI>-Saffron, there in the Countrey call'd <HI>Tametavee,</HI> and by <HI>Linschot</HI> in <HI>Malays, Cunhet,</HI> and <HI>Curcuma.</HI> The Root is like to that of Ginger, yellow in the in-side, and tastes like it, but not so sharp.</P>
<P><HI>Voutzere</HI> grows on a middle-siz'd Tree, with broad Leaves, being as big as an Egg, with much Juice within, like a <HI>Coco</HI>-Nut: The dry part is good to eat; and of the Leaves the Inhabitants make Mats, Ropes, and Baskets.</P>
<P><HI>Achith</HI> is a certain sort of Vine, with round and indented Leaves, remaining always green, and never falling off, bearing Fruit call'd <HI>Vouchits,</HI> of the bigness of a green Grape, and ripe in <HI>October, January,</HI> and <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anboutou,</HI> a small Herb, proportion'd as our Flax, but somewhat rank of taste, and bitterish. The Inhabitants chew this Herb to colour the Gums, Teeth and Lips black, and to perfume their Breath. It strengthens much, and therefore in times of Famine they eat it to corroborate the Vitals.</P>
<P><HI>Lengou</HI> grows upon a creeping Plant, in bigness like a Nut, with many cor∣ners: The taste comes near that of a green Walnut. They chew the Shell, for the same reason as the former.</P>

Those that are not us'd to take it, like two or three days together as if they were distracted; and therefore none but old Women, and the <HI>Ombiassen,</HI> that is, the Soothsayers, or Priests, and Learned Men, take of it.

<P>The Woods swarm with wild Hogs, which do great hurt to the Rice-Fields. The Flesh of these, but chiefly of the Sows and young ones, is esteemed a choyce Dainty. The common Hogs makes very good and wholsom Pork; for though one eats never so much of it, he will not surfet, perhaps by reason of their good feeding, which consists most in Land-Turtles, and their Eggs.</P>
<P>There are another sort call'd <HI>Tendrak,</HI> whose Flesh, though not very pleasing to the Pallat, yet the Inhabitants hold for a great Dainty: They sleep six moneths under ground without eating, and in that time shed their Bristles, and other new ones appear in their places, sharp, like those of Hedghogs.</P>

These may be tam'd without difficulty, if taken young, or else they will starve themselves to death.</P>
<P>There are white Apes, call'd <HI>Sifak,</HI> with yellowish Heads, white Tails, and two Spots on their Sides, are much bigger than the <HI>Varii,</HI> and usually walk on their hindmost Legs, and keep in the Woods in great companies.

<P><HI>Famokantratra,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vermin.</NOTE> a small Beast, having Legs at the Tail, above the Neck, and on the outmost part of the Chin, small Claws, with which it hangs fast on the Barks of the Trees. It holds the Mouth always open to receive Spiders, Muggs, and other Vermin, whereon it feeds: It gain'd the Name <HI>Flamo∣kantratra,</HI> that is, <HI>Breast-hopper,</HI> because it leaps upon the Breast of any that ap∣proach near the Tree where it sits; and sticks so close and fast, that the skin must be cut away with a Rasor to remove it: for which reason the Inhabitants much fear it.</P>

They cure it in the same manner as the Sting of a Scorpion, by laying the Sick before a great Fire, and giving them wholsom Medicines to dispell the Poyson; <HI>Anakalife,</HI> a Reptile, breeding between the Barks of rotten Trees: It is about a handful long, full of Legs, flat and thick, with a very hard Skin.

<P><HI>Sakondre,</HI> a sort of <HI>Meskito's,</HI> that sit on the Bark of a small Tree like white Blossoms, but afterwards change into several colours, as green intermixt with red, and the like. These make a Honey as sweet as Sugar.</P>
<P><HI>Herechereche,</HI> a kind of Glow-worm, lies in the Night glistering in the Woods, and on the tops of Houses, like a spark of Fire.</P>
<P><HI>Tsingoulou Voulou</HI> are of several sorts, a small Creature, infesting the Houses, but do a great deal of hurt by running over, and eating the Victuals, as Honey, Milk, and other Provisions.</P>
<P>There are also Pismires, which make Honey like Bees, in hollow Trees and heaps of Earth, wherein they sit by thousands.</P>
<PB N="692" REF="428"/>
<P>Worms also breed there of divers sorts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worms.</NOTE> as long Earth-worms, call'd <HI>Saho;</HI> Wood-worms, from eating the Wood, nam'd <HI>Anakau;</HI> and others with a Head like a Boar; Some with Scales on their Bodies, that eat into the Beams and Planks of a Ship, sloaping to one side, but go not quite through. Variety of Silk-worms, as <HI>Landeve,</HI> which produce one single Egge, with small Thorns; <HI>Landesaraha</HI> lay small Eggs, inclos'd in one greater, wherein sometimes are found above five hundred; The third <HI>Landeanakau,</HI> make their Silk on a Tree call'd <HI>Anakui,</HI> growing on the Sea-shore like a Cypress, and their Eggs hang one by one at a small Thred: this Silk proves the finest and strongest of all; The fourth, <HI>Landevansaqua,</HI> makes a fine Silk upon the Tree <HI>Vontonquer.</HI></P>
<P>Land-Turtles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An amphibious Creature.</NOTE> or <HI>Tanou,</HI> are many, and of two sorts, the one styl'd <HI>Helintsoka,</HI> and the others <HI>Fanou:</HI> Nor want they <HI>Bouchete,</HI> or great Toads, and <HI>Saouh</HI> Frogs.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are either white or black;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Inhabi∣tants.</NOTE> The <HI>Whites</HI> divide themselves into three Tribes, <HI>Rohandrians, Anakandrians,</HI> and <HI>Ondazatsi;</HI> The <HI>Blacks</HI> into four sorts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Linschot.</NOTE> <HI>Voadziri, Lohavohits, Ontson,</HI> and <HI>Ondeves,</HI> as we before related at large in the Territory of <HI>Carcanossi</HI> or <HI>Anossi.</HI></P>
<P>In some places they tell of a wild People, by them call'd <HI>Ompizees,</HI> which let Hairs of their Heads and Beards grow very long, and go stark naked, onely with a few broad Leaves before their Privacies. They keep in the thickest Woods, and shun Converse with any other <HI>Blacks,</HI> living upon Fish, Venison, Fruits, Roots, wild Honey, and Grashoppers.</P>
<P>Formerly there lived on the Island <HI>Ontaysatrouha,</HI> lying between the <HI>Anachi∣moussi</HI> and the River <HI>Ranoumene,</HI> a People which held conversation with their Neighbors, but Warred against them continually: and not onely against them, but likewise against all others that travel'd through their Countrey. They cut the sick Peoples Throats which they thought past recovery, and brought their Hands to the King to eat.</P>
<P>They feed many Cows, but neither kill them, nor Steers, Rams, Goats, nor Cocks (Cows Milk being their chiefest Diet) and therefore Heifers, Sheep, and Goats, they bring to sleep upon Mats, and after their death bury them under ground. They did eat Dogs with a great appetite, when no longer fit for Boar-hunting. They till'd their Ground in the same manner as the other <HI>Blacks</HI> on this Island. Their Features are frightful and ill-favor'd, for they have small Eyes, a broad Forehead, sharp Teeth, <HI>Camosie</HI> Noses, thick Lips, with short curl'd Hair, russet Skins, without Beards, great Belly'd, and thin Legs. These People did eat one another up, by which means being reduced to a small number, they were all, about a hundred and twenty years since, destroy'd by their neighboring People and Enemies; so that now not one of them remains.</P>
<P>Some have reported that Giants and Dwarfs have been found on this Island; but occular experience hath proved that Assertion but a Fable. In a Tract of Land by <HI>Itapere</HI> are many Stones erected, under which the Dwarfs are said to lie buried; for (say the Learned) they came in great numbers, and would have committed Spoil in the Countrey of <HI>Anossi,</HI> whence they had been driven to the River <HI>Itapere:</HI> but when for want of Boats they could not come over, they were all slain by the Inhabitants, and buried; who for a remem∣brance of the Victory, raised these Stones as a Monument.</P>
<P>No People in the world are so treacherous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Disposition.</NOTE> spiteful, flattering, and lying, as those of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> onely towards the South-end in <HI>Mangabey</HI> they seem better condition'd, are less talkative, not so cruel in disposition, nor so deceit∣ful;
<PB N="693" REF="428"/>for they live according to other Laws and Customs, and boast them∣selves sprung from the Stock of <HI>Abraham.</HI> All the other do nothing but cheat, lye, and betray: they promise much, and do little, unless by compulsion: They Govern by tyrannous cruelty, without mercy or favour. If it chance that any escape their Enemies or Prosecutors hands, such is their monstrous ingratitude, that they never return thanks, but ascribe it to their <HI>Auli,</HI> or For∣tune, and it makes them more perverse than before. Cruelty and treachery they hold for two Capital Vertues; and those accounted weak Men, and faint∣hearted, who pardon an offence, or use remission and compassion: They for∣bear not to exercise their barbarous ferocity even upon Children, whom as they meet they cut or tear in pieces, and rip up the Women with an atrocity beyond the salvageness of Bruits, taking a delight to see them gasp and pant for life. Their Recreations are barbarous shriekings, which they term Sing∣ing, and antick skrewing of their Bodies in stead of Dancing. Man-like Exer∣cises they hate, alledging, that all things laborious bring much more displea∣sure and vexation, than delight: These mock at the <HI>French</HI> when they see them walk, and count them Fools for wearying themselves without a cause.</P>
<P>The civiler sort of these Islanders employ themselves in tilling the Ground,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Employment.</NOTE> having little knowledge in Merchandise, neither taking care to find out Han∣dicrafts and Arts. They neither desire, nor indeed ask for such things as Fo∣reigners happen to bring thither, but remain satisfi'd with making and procu∣ring that which they need for sustenance, Clothing and Housing, without thought of superfluity: And this manner of life they hold more delightful and happy, than the enjoyment of superfluous Varieties. Their chiefest handy∣work is in building of Houses, working of Iron and Gold, Turning, making of Pots, Spinning, Weaving, Rope-making, Fishing, Hunting, and above all, (as already mention'd) cultivating the Ground.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Ompanefavihe</HI> make of Iron and Steel, all manner of Imple∣ments, as Bills, Hammers, Knives, Tongs, in their Countrey Language call'd <HI>Fanghali,</HI> Scissers, little Pinsers to pluck out the Hairs, Spits to roast Meat on, Forcks, all sorts of Javelins, or Lances, Arrows, and great Butchers Knives.</P>
<P>The Goldsmiths, which proceed most out of the Territory of <HI>Voamaro,</HI> make of their In-land Gold, first melted in little Bars, Ear-rings and Armlets, Orna∣ments for the Neck, and other parts of the Body.</P>
<P>The Potters bake or burn with Haw-thorn Boughs, their Earthen Pots of all sorts, great and small Dishes, Platters, Pitchers, and Cups, which by rub∣bing over with a black Earth, shine, and are like Looking-glasses, as if they were Polish'd or Glaz'd.</P>
<P>The Turners and Workers in Wood make Wooden Dishes, Chests, by them call'd <HI>Vaa,</HI> Wooden, and Horn-Spoons, and other Housholdstuff.</P>
<P>In Architecture, if so we may call it, the <HI>Zafferamini, Rohandrians, Anakandri∣ans,</HI> are eminent.</P>
<P>They Fish with Nets like those us'd in Ships, Baskets in manner of Purse-Nets,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishing.</NOTE> Angles, and Lances, with Harping-Irons at the end. Those that Fish in the Sea, put out with small <HI>Canoos,</HI> so far as they can see, and catch with the foremention'd Baskets small Fishes, which serve them for Baits to catch big∣ger. Formerly they us'd to take Whales here, but now they have not the bold∣ness to atempt it.</P>
<P>The Rope-makers make Cords of all sizes and lengths; some of an hundred and thirty Fathom, besides smaller Tackle, to tie their Baskets and Nets.</P>
<PB N="694" REF="429"/>
<P>The Women Spin, and Weave many sorts of Stuffs, of Flax or Thred, drawn from Barks of Trees, with which the Men must not meddle, as being an undervaluing.</P>
<P>Their Husbandry and method of Agriculture is perform'd with little labor; for they use neither Ploughs or Oxen, but meerly with a Bill cut away the great Trees, with a Cutting-Knife Prune off the Branches, and with other Implements, call'd <HI>Fangali,</HI> take away the Roots and Weeds out of the Earth, and cast it abroad. Afterwards the wither'd Trees, Branches and Boughs, when a strong Wind blows, are set on fire and burnt to ashes, and therein, after it is throughly moistned with Rain, they Plant the <HI>Igname</HI>-Roots, Rice, and other Provision for Food.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding their ignorance of Arts and Sciences,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Games.</NOTE> they are possess'd with the humor of Gaming, of which two sorts are chiefly in use, <HI>Andrauve</HI> and <HI>Fifangha.</HI> At the Game <HI>Andrauve</HI> they Play with little Shells, found on the Sea∣shore, which they turn round, that at a little distance they may strike one upon another. All the Men, as well great as small, are so much besotted with this Game, that sometimes they will venture a whole Ox at one of those hits. <HI>Fi∣fangha</HI> is a very pleasant Sport, but requires greater nimbleness of Wit and Judgment than that of <HI>Andrauve,</HI> because it consists most in sleight of hand: two Gamesters can onely Play; the manner is with certain round Fruit, call'd <HI>Bassy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Herb call'd <HI>Gold-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nappe.</HI></NOTE> to the number of sixty four, upon a Wooden Table, with two and thirty holes, in four rows one by another, sixteen for one Gamester, and sixteen for the other. This Game hath great agreement with Chesse, or Draughts.</P>
<P>Their Songs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Songs and Dancings.</NOTE> which (as we said) are very untunable, yet consist not as to scurrility or obscenity, but either satyrical Reproofs, or high Eulogies of the Vices or Vertues of particular Persons, or else in exalting the praise-worthy, and famous Deeds of their Ancestors.</P>
<P>In Singing they continually Dance and Leap, having a <HI>Valihan,</HI> or small In∣strument of Musick in their Hands, with some Strings; or Playing upon a <HI>Voulle,</HI> or <HI>Bambo's</HI>-Cane with six Strings, or upon a <HI>Herraavou,</HI> a Musical Instru∣ment struck with little Sticks, somewhat after the manner of a <HI>Jewish</HI> Dul∣cimer.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Carcanossi</HI> Dance turning round, and going one after another, then standing still, and at last falling off on the sides at the sound of a Drum, but not without shewing a thousand fantastick postures.</P>
<P>The <HI>Herraavou</HI> Players have commonly most followers, which relate or ex∣press nothing but serious Matters, though sometimes old Stories and Fancies.</P>
<P>The Houses have no Chambers above,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> nor Cellars underneath; but meerly one Room, which they call <HI>Varerarai,</HI> with a small Floor or Cieling. The Roof stands sloaping, made of the Leaves call'd <HI>Rattes,</HI> and <HI>Bambo's</HI> Canes, or of Boughs. The Walls made of Planks two Inches thick. The Hearth-place at the end of the House, about four Foot square, heightned with Sand, upon which lie three Stones to set the Pot upon, but without a Chimney, so that the Smoke goes all over the House; which makes their Abodes very unplea∣sant, they likewise keeping continual Fires, though the heat of the Weather be never so excessive.</P>
<P>The Ware-houses, wherein they keep their Rice, stand by themselves rais'd upon Posts, to hinder the Rats climbing up to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rohandrians</HI> spend some time two or three years in building their Hou∣ses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">House-warming.</NOTE> not that the curiosity of workmanship, or largeness of dimensions requires
<PB N="695" REF="429"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> so much time, but in conjecturing by their Prognostications and Sorcery, about lucky Days and Hours to work in. The House finished, they set a lucky Moneth or Day apart, to keep their <HI>Missavatsi,</HI> that is, their <HI>Entrance,</HI> or <HI>House∣warming,</HI> which they ceremoniously observe: To which end the Master of the House calls together all to him, and all their Kindred, Friends and Acquain∣tance, who bring Cattel for a Present, some seven, some five, some three, others but one, according to every ones ability, to the meanest Slave, who bring Baskets of Mats, Dishes, Earthen Pots, Honey, Wine, <HI>Bannanes-Fruit,</HI> and Roots of Rice; so that upon that Day none appears empty handed. It hath happen'd within few years, that a certain <HI>Dian,</HI> or Lord, by Name <HI>Ramach,</HI> pre∣sented to another <HI>Dian,</HI> call'd <HI>Tserong,</HI> at the <HI>Mistavatsi</HI> of a new House, a Gold Chain, worth an hundred Beasts, eighteen Baskets of Rice, and as many of <HI>Ignames,</HI> and so all the rest, every one according to his Estate, so that this <HI>Dian Tserong</HI> had the worth of a thousand Head of Cattel. After all the Presents are brought together, and the Assembly Day come, <HI>Dian Tserong</HI> appeared in the Evening, in his <HI>Angarata,</HI> cover'd with a long Garment, and Gold <HI>Menilies,</HI> and other costly Habiliments, with a Sword by his side; twenty <HI>Ondzatsi,</HI> that is, <HI>Fishers,</HI> who were follow'd with Women, with necessaries of Wood to make Clothes with; afterwards came nine <HI>Rohandrians,</HI> each carrying three Sugar-Canes, and eight <HI>Ondzatsi,</HI> every one with a Wax Torch; then all the chief <HI>Ro∣handrians</HI> made a turn thrice round about the House; entring into the House, they all one with one voyce make a great noyse, crying altogether, <HI>Ha;</HI> then stamp upon the Ground with their Feet, and tumble down upon it, crying <HI>Hic, hac, ha,</HI> whereupon all the standers by cry aloud, <HI>Dria, dria, dria, Rohandria, takalounaho, falissanaho,</HI> that is, <HI>Sir, we wish you luck and good speed:</HI> whereupon the <HI>Dian Tserong</HI> answer'd, <HI>Vellam coua Auareo,</HI> that is, <HI>The same I wish to you,</HI> with some other words of like good will on both sides. At last <HI>Dian Tserong</HI> parts the Sugar-Canes among the <HI>Rohandrians</HI> to eat.</P>
<P>The next day in the Morning a <HI>Rohandrian</HI> appears bravely Clothed, with a
<PB N="696" REF="430"/>Girdle across, after the manner of a Star upon his Breast, and after three times turning round about the House, with a great Slaughter-Knife in his Hands laid thirty six Oxen upon the Ground, with their Legs ty'd together, and cut their Throats, dipt his Finger in the Blood, and put it upon his Forehead, and upon his Breast, and brought it to <HI>Dian Tserong,</HI> and the <HI>Rohandrians:</HI> after this was done, he with Fewel made a Fire, and singed off the Hair, and cut the Oxen in pieces, and divided them amongst the standers by: Next morning he fell to drinking of Wine, and in the Evening eat Rice and other Food, which continu'd so for eight days, slaying every day so many Oxen, without reckon∣ing other Cattel, which he distributed among the <HI>Dians,</HI> or Lords of the Towns, and <HI>Lovahits;</HI> so that above four hundred Beasts were eaten at this <HI>Missavatsi,</HI> and yet <HI>Tserong</HI> had great Gain, and for the Expences laid out in building of his House, was richly paid.</P>
<P>This House was about four Fathom broad, and eight or nine Fathom long, but scarce high enough for a Man to stand upright in, with Walls of Planks two Inches thick; it stood two Foot and a half from the Ground, and had six Doors, two before, and two behind, and on each side one, but all low, so that without stooping none could go in: The Roof ran up to a Point, consisting of Leaves call'd <HI>Rattes,</HI> which lay cross one upon another, bound together with <HI>Mahovits,</HI> and Peeling of a certain Tree, together with <HI>Bambo's</HI> Canes, cut into little Shingles, very neatly. This manner of Roofing is very handsom, but subject to burning. Some cover their Houses with green Boughs and Grass; others with broad Leaves, call'd <HI>Raven pandre,</HI> but they are not so du∣rable.</P>
<P>Their Housholdstuff consists in Mats,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Housholdstuff.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Sihi,</HI> and are two∣fold; some red and yellow-colour'd, and very neatly; others common, but yet very convenient; both Braided, or made of several sorts of Bulrushes; with which (in stead of Tapistry) they hang the Walls of the Houses, and sleep up∣on them; for Bedding, Sheets, Mattresses, or Coverlets, are not made among them, being from their Infancy us'd to lie hard. A great many Baskets, where∣in they lay up their Clothes, Girdles, or Belts, or <HI>Saravohits,</HI> Cotton-Merchan∣dize, and all Ornaments which they have. Little Earthen Cruises for their Oyl, wherewith they anoint their Hair and Bodies. Kitchin-Vessels, as Earth∣en Pots, call'd <HI>Villangues, Louvies, Faffes, Monhonges,</HI> and <HI>Sines;</HI> Wooden Dishes and Spoons, Pitchers to fetch Water in, Knives call'd <HI>Antsi,</HI> great and small, both sorts made very neatly, according to the Mode of the Place; small Pin∣cers to pull Thorns out of their Feet, and to pull off the Hair; great Slaughter-Knives, to cut Cattels Throats, Iron Forks to pull the Meat out of the Pots, Roasters, or Gridirons, of three Irons, or Ribs, call'd <HI>Zalaza;</HI> and a Mortar to stamp Rice in, with a Wooden Bason to Fan it in. Cruises, or Pots, of above a hundred Quarts, wherein they make Meath of Honey. But they use no Table-Linnen, Towels, Earthen or Pewter Trenchers, nor Tables or Stools; but the Earth, spread over with a Mat, serves them both for Table and Stools; and great Leaves call'd <HI>Rattes,</HI> of twelve Foot long, and four broad, for Tren∣chers and Table-clothes: of these Leaves also Spons and Drinking-Cups are made, and Roofs for their Houses, when they are dry.</P>
<P>The Men wear a Cloth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habit.</NOTE> call'd <HI>Laneba,</HI> about their Bodies, with a <HI>Saravorits</HI> under their Drawers; but the Women an <HI>Accanza,</HI> or long Coat without Sleeves; though those of <HI>Manghabei</HI> wear them with Sleeves, and a little Cloth before their Privacies in stead of an Apron: Both Men and Women go bare∣head
<PB N="697" REF="430"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> and bare-foot, except those of <HI>Manghabei,</HI> where the Men wear a four∣square Bonnet, and the Women a <HI>Caproeu,</HI> Kerchiff, or Hood, sharp above, which comes half way their Heads, but hangs behind their Necks, and over their Shoulders.</P>
<P>Their Clothes are of several colours and names; some all of red Silk call'd <HI>Sohatsmifili;</HI> others of Cotton styl'd <HI>Varo;</HI> a third of red and mingled-colour'd Silk, Woven with pure Cotton underneath, and strip'd with white; others of Peelings of the Bark of <HI>Fantatstanou, Try, Mouffia, Avo, Courave,</HI> and the Thred of the <HI>Bananos</HI>-Tree. The best and finest are Cotton-Clothes of <HI>Anossi,</HI> made by the <HI>Zafferamini,</HI> and much bought up. Them which are chiefly desired, have the breadth of twelve Inches, below border'd with Silk, the Ground of it white, with black Stripes; and some of black Woven Cotton and red Silk: and the great <HI>Rohandrians</HI> themselves may onely wear that, and onely in great Solemnities: They provide it also to Livery their Grandees in.</P>
<P>The Clothes of the Bark of <HI>Fantatstanou,</HI> are made near <HI>Manatengha, Manghafia, Soudrevingha,</HI> and <HI>Anossi,</HI> in this order: The Bark of the Tree, growing at the Water side, they first draw to Thred, and afterwards boyl in a strong Lye: the scowr'd Threds are afterwards twisted together, and by means of a Spindle, spun together, and at last Woven into Cloth. This Cloth so imitates ours of Hemp or Flax, that such as had never seen it, would have taken it for the same. It wears strong, and endures three times as long as Cotton. Of this Bark also they make Sail-Clothes, or Cordage.</P>
<P>The Clothes of the Bark <HI>Try</HI> are made of the <HI>Sazles</HI> of Thred, of a certain Shrub that affords Milk, and groweth much in the Territory of <HI>Ampatre,</HI> wears very soft, but not so strong as the Cotton. The Clothes call'd <HI>Afouche</HI> are com∣monly in the Countrey of <HI>Matatane,</HI> made of the Bark of the Plant <HI>Avo;</HI> of which also they make Paper, soft and gentle, but not strong. <HI>Moufia</HI> Clothes are wrought in <HI>Galemboullou, Manghabei,</HI> and the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Antongil,</HI> of the Peelings of tender Leaves, which shoot from the Tree <HI>Moufia,</HI> the overgrown being
<PB N="698" REF="431"/>great stalky Leaves, twelve or fifteen Foot long. <HI>Bananos</HI> Clothes are very light, and as fine as Silk Clothes. All these are Woven in the same manner as our Linnen.</P>
<P>The Ornaments,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ornaments.</NOTE> or <HI>Firavach,</HI> with which these Islanders dress themselves, consist especially in Chains, which they wear on their Necks, Arms and Legs; Gold Ear-rings, Bracelets or Rings, and other small Trifles, <HI>Saraves,</HI> of Chains of Glass-Beads, fine Pearls, Corral, Pipes of Gold, Beads of red Crystal, Agats, Cornelions, Sardonyx, two or four double hang'd about the Neck. <HI>Salintes</HI> consist of pieces of Corral, Agats, and red Crystal. <HI>Endach</HI> are made of all sorts of colour'd small round Glass-Beads, and four, six, eight, or twelve Strings worn at once. The <HI>Zafferamini,</HI> or <HI>Whites,</HI> of <HI>Matatane,</HI> have their Ears bor'd through, wherein they wear Gold Ear-rings, which are of two sorts, one of clean and Massie Gold, which they call <HI>Foamitoulie;</HI> the other onely an <HI>East-India</HI> Snall-shell, cover'd over with Leaf-gold, and curiously wrought: for Goldsmiths there have no <HI>Borax,</HI> yet they know with small red Beans (in their Countrey Language call'd <HI>Voamene,</HI> and in the <HI>Indian, Condure</HI>) how to Solder small Grains of Gold together very handsomly and artificially. They have the Gilded Shells made into Necklaces, by them denominated <HI>Verenhere.</HI> Also <HI>Menilies</HI> of Gold, Silver, and Brass on their Arms, and Gold, Silver, and Cop∣per Rings on their Fingers; besides <HI>Matahets an Poutan</HI> on their Thighs, Arms, and Legs, of the same Stuff with their Neck-chains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zafferamini,</HI> and chiefest <HI>Anakandrians,</HI> may wear the beforemention'd Ornaments; but the <HI>Blacks</HI> not, except the <HI>Voadziri,</HI> and <HI>Lohavohits,</HI> to whom and their Wives and Children it is permitted to wear Gold Ear-rings, and some pieces of Gold, but Pendants onely of Silver or Copper.</P>
<P>Every one may have as many Wives as he can keep,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage.</NOTE> whom they intitle <HI>Manpirate,</HI> that is, <HI>Make-bates:</HI> for the Women of one Man alone, hate one ano∣ther as deadly Enemies, and call one another by the Name of <HI>Mirafe,</HI> that is, <HI>Envy,</HI> without taking exceptions at it.</P>
<P>The Women are no less addicted to Venereal Sportings than the Men, and they let no opportunity pass to accomplish those Designs, having always be∣sides their Husband one or two Gallants, with whom to take their pleasure.</P>
<P>Unmarry'd Girls give their Viginity to the first that come to them, if they give them Money; but if they fail of Payment, they deride and disgrace them, by taking away their Garment, which they cannot regain but by recon∣ciliation. But Slaves who have no Money, spend their wanton Lusts with Beasts, without being punished or reproved for it.</P>
<P>Whoredom between unmarry'd Persons they account no sin against God or Man; yea, no Girl will promise her self to a Suitor, whom she hath not had the proof of often, and a long time before: And Marry'd people themselves think the bonds of Wedlock a wrong to them.</P>
<P>Young Youths and Girls use their pleasure together in the presence of their Parents, who are not onely pleased therewith, but provoke them to it.</P>
<P>Yet among all this common and beastial licentiousness, they account it a great shame for their Daughter or Wives, to be too much addicted to wanton unchastity, to hear them prate of it, or to divulge any evil Prank they have done: Moreover they think it redounds to their dishonour, that any should ask them how many Wives they have, or whether they be fair or ill-favor'd.</P>
<P>Here are found some impotent effeminate Men, call'd <HI>Tsecats,</HI> who seek for Boys, and fall in Love with them under pretence of being Women; and to that
<PB N="699" REF="431"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> purpose name and Clothe themselves as Women, whom in all Cases they avoid and shun, because they have from youth up made a vow, never to know any of that Sex.</P>
<P>Their manner of Burials hath great Ceremonies:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of their Fu∣nerals.</NOTE> for the next of Kin to the Deceased wash the Corps very clean, and adorn it with Gold Bracelets, Ear∣rings and Chains, deckt with Beads and other Gayeties, and so bury in two or three of his finest Garments; but carry it wound up in a great Mat to the Grave. Persons of Quality have their Hair shaven off, and Women have a Quoif put on: but before that is done, all the Acquaintance, Friends, and Slaves of the Deceased come into the House of the Dead, lamenting round about the Corps, at whose Feet a Candle stands burning night and day. In the mean while the Drummers beat upon the Drums, and many Women and Maids Dance to the sound thereof a sober Dance; which done, they go to la∣ment in the Funeral-house, and so fall to Dancing again, the Men by turns exercising themselves with their Weapons. Those that lament in the House of Mourning, exalt the Praise of the Deceased, declaring how much sorrow his departure brings, and speak of him as still alive: Lastly, having bewail'd the Corps till the Evening, Oxen are slain, and the Flesh when boyl'd or roasted, distributed among the Assembly. The next day in the Morning the Corps is laid into a strong Chest, made of two pieces of the Stock of a Tree hollow'd, close joyn'd, and therein carry'd to the Church-yard, by them call'd <HI>Amounouque,</HI> where they set it in an artificial Vault, six Foot under ground, with a Basket of Rice, a Box of Tobacco, Earthen Dishes, some Comfects, Perfumes to burn, Clothes, and a Girdle; then being shut up, and a great Stone, twelve or fifteen Foot high, set before it, many Beasts are sacrificed, of which they leave one part for the Dead, one for the Devil, and one for God: The acquaintance af∣ter eight or fifteen days send by the Slaves Food to the Dead, and cause him to be saluted as if alive. They set up also round about the Grave upon Stakes, the Heads of the sacrificed Beasts, and the Children come thither from time to

If they be sick, or afflicted with distemper of Mind, then presently the next Friends to the Sick send an <HI>Ombyasse,</HI> or Priest, to seek the Spirit in the Church-yard, who goes thither in the Night, and makes a hole in the Vault where the Corps lie, and calls the Soul of the Father of the Sick, asking it, <HI>Whether the Spirit hath nothing more for his Son or Daughter.</HI> Furthermore, he holds a Cap over the hole, and presently shuts the Cap close to it, and runs point-blank to the House of the sick Person, who is sottish enough to say, <HI>That he feels himself well, and hath gotten his Spirit again which he had lost in his Sickness,</HI> appointing a Present to be given to the <HI>Ombyasse.</HI></P>
<P>When any Person of Eminency happens to die far from his Countrey, then they cut his Head off, to bring it to his native Soyl, but bury the Carcase where he died. If he be slain in the Wars, they bury him in that place where kill'd, but upon the setling of Peace dig him up again, and lay him in the Vault with his Ancestors.</P>
<P>The solemnest and highest Oath which they take,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath.</NOTE> is by the Souls of their Ancestors.</P>
<P>Among all the Inhumanities of these salvage People,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An abominable deed in forsaking their Children.</NOTE> the most horrible and abominable is, that the People of <HI>Madagascar</HI> do cruelly cast away their Chil∣dren; so that Men have no cause at all to wonder, why this Island, so large and fertile, falls short in the account of populosity, because from the Birth those Innocents are condemn'd to lose the light of the Day, before they have scarce seen it, suffering it to perish by the sottish and damnable advice of their <HI>Ombyasses,</HI> or Priests, who counsel the Fathers to leave their Children, and cause them by a Slave to be carry'd far from the Town, and under some Hedge, or in the Woods, to be expos'd to the mercy of Wind and Weather, Dogs, wild Bears, and other devouring Beasts, where at last with much cry∣ing and lamenting, they famish for Hunger and Thirst, or are cruelly de∣vour'd.</P>
<P>The cause why they do thus destroy their new-born Children is, that they believe them born in an unlucky Day, Moneth, or Hour, and the rather, when the <HI>Ombyasse</HI> sees, that the Configuration of the Childs Planets do not serve his purpose, then says that the Child will be a Murtherer of his Father and Mother, and his Life unfortunate, and inclin'd to do all manner of evil, and therefore must be made away.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Moneths are especially <HI>April,</HI> which they call <HI>Saffard,</HI> and the Fasting Moneth, <HI>Rama-hara;</HI> but in every Moneth the eighth Day, nam'd <HI>Assaronton,</HI> and the last Quarter of the Moon, call'd <HI>Alcacossy. Wednesdays</HI> and <HI>Fridays</HI> in every Week are ill Days, and the Hours which are govern'd by an evil <HI>Vitang,</HI> or Planet; so that these People account almost half the Year un∣lucky. Nevertheless, some among them have a little more pity and compas∣sion towards their Children, and after they have so barbarously expos'd them, let their Slaves (their Maid-Servants) go instantly, and take it thenceand Suckle it: however, they account it no more theirs, but appropriate to the Person that takes it up, or the Nurse. Others are satisfi'd by performing <HI>Fa∣lis</HI> for their Children, that is, they sacrifice Beasts and Hens, and shut them half a day (as they say) to prevent the malign influence of the Constellation that reigns over them: for if they should let them live, and not perform this,
<PB N="701" REF="432"/>Ceremony, they would another day be Robbers and Murtherers of their Fa∣thers, and adicted to all Mischief.</P>
<P>If a poor unmarried Woman-Slave have a Child, and her Master hath put her away, she will not stick to drown the Child in the River, or bury it alive in the Ground, or otherwise kill it, to rid her of the burthen, trouble, and care of bringing up. If a Woman, when she is great with Child, and is very sick, or has hard Labor, they impute the fault to the Child, and the Woman orders them to kill, or to bury it alive.</P>
<P>If the Daughter of a <HI>Rohandrian</HI> hath had to do with a <HI>Negro</HI> before she be Married (as they all do, none excepted) she either causes an Abortion, or, if she be deliver'd, makes away the Child.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there are some, though few, that do it not, but cause the Child to be carried afar off, and nursed by her own <HI>Negresses.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, If a Woman die in Labor, they bury the Child alive with the Mother, saying, <HI>That it is better it should die than live, having no Mother left to bring it up.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants, both <HI>Whites</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Eating.</NOTE> observe a peculiar and evil Custom in Eating, though their Victuals is dress'd very neatly and handsomly.</P>
<P>The People of the <HI>Rohandrians</HI> eat with <HI>Rohandrians;</HI> the <HI>Lohavohits,</HI> with <HI>Lohavohits;</HI> the <HI>Ontsoa's,</HI> with their own Tribe, and never intermixedly; in∣somuch that no <HI>Rohandrian</HI> Woman, married to an <HI>Anakandrian,</HI> will endure that her Husband should eat with her: But in <HI>Manghabei,</HI> the Slaves eat with their Masters.</P>
<P>They have their Meal-times commonly in the Morning, and in the Evening; but the <HI>Zafferamimi</HI> make five or six Meals in a day.</P>
<P>Their usual Food is Rice, Beans, <HI>Voanzonrouk,</HI> or little Wheat,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE> call'd also <HI>Vo∣enzou,</HI> or <HI>Mimes,</HI> and <HI>Voamitsa-Ofekque; Ignames</HI> of several sorts; Coleworts, which they call <HI>Sanzes,</HI> and <HI>Varuattes;</HI> Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Hens, Capons, Turkeys, by them styl'd <HI>Alcanga;</HI> Ducks, Pigs; but never any grown Hogs, except they Hunt them, and then they and their whole Family eat them: Ma∣ny sorts of Sea and River Fish; <HI>Menachil,</HI> or Oyl of <HI>Sesamos,</HI> and Oyl of <HI>Ovi∣naa:</HI> Several Fruits, as <HI>Vontaka, Lamontes, Voarats, Voanattes, Lotfes, Sakol,</HI> the Fruit <HI>Sakre, Co,</HI> Sugar-Canes, and <HI>Bananoes.</HI> They live also, in time of Scarci∣ty or Famine, upon certain Roots which grow in the Water, and in the Woods; as Roots of <HI>Ouirandre, Oumenpasso,</HI> and <HI>Ouuirouzes.</HI> For Sauce to their Meat, they usually have Ginger, Garlick-Leaves, and White Pepper, though at the begin∣ning they look'd upon it as Poyson. Their usual Drink is warm Water, or the Broath wherein they boyl their Meat. They make Wine of Honey; yet they drink it not, but in their <HI>Missavatsi,</HI> and chief Solemnities.</P>
<P>They speak but one Language through the whole Island;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> but very different in the Tone and Pronunciation; some giving them a short, and some a long Accent.</P>
<P>This Language hath much affinity with the Eastern, especially the <HI>Arabick;</HI> and great agreement with the <HI>Greek,</HI> as well in the manner of Expression, as in the connexing of Names and Compound-words. Every thing is call'd accord∣ing to the Action, or manner of Operation by which it is effected: as, a bro∣ken Tree, or Stick, they call <HI>Hazonfaulac;</HI> a torn Cloth, <HI>Sichinrota;</HI> a broken Pot, <HI>Vilanghavakqui;</HI> broken Thred, <HI>Foulomaitou;</HI> and so many other things: which expresseth the copiousness of the Tongue.</P>
<P>In the manner of their speaking, there happens a change of some Conso∣nant
<PB N="702" REF="433"/>Letters. The <HI>V</HI> is chang'd into a <HI>B,</HI> when the anticedent Word ends in a Consonant; as for Exampie, <HI>Vohits</HI> signifies <HI>A Mountain;</HI> but to say <HI>Ambohits,</HI> which signifies <HI>In the Mountain,</HI> the <HI>V</HI> must be chang'd into <HI>B:</HI> The Letter <HI>F</HI> they turn into <HI>P,</HI> thus: <HI>Fasso</HI> signifies <HI>Sand,</HI> or the <HI>Shore;</HI> but when the Word <HI>An</HI> comes before it, they must say <HI>Anpasso,</HI> that is, <HI>In,</HI> or <HI>on the Sand,</HI> or <HI>Shore;</HI> as also in many others: The Lords Prayer is thus; <HI>Amproy Antsica izau hanoutang andanghitsi, angharanau hofissahots, Vahouachanau hoavi aminay, fiteiannau boefaizangh an tane toua andanghitsi; Mahoumehanau anrou aniou abinaihane antsica, aman hanau Mang∣bafaca, hanay ota antsica; Tona-Zahai Manghafaca hota anreo Mououany, amanhanau aca Mahatet Seanay abin fiuet seuetse ratsi, fehe hanau Metezaha hanay tabin haratsian abi, Amin.</HI></P>
<P>The Letters which the <HI>Ombiasses</HI> or Priests make use of, are the same with the <HI>Arabick,</HI> and eight and twenty in number, written from the right hand to the left; though the Pronunciation of some of them differ from those of the <HI>Ara∣bick.</HI> These Letters, about two hundred years ago, were brought in among them by certain <HI>Arabians,</HI> who were sent into this Island by the <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Mecha,</HI> and Landed in <HI>Matatane,</HI> where they Married the Native Women, and Instru∣cted every one that would in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue, and <HI>Alchoran,</HI> as they do at this day.</P>
<P>The Paper they write upon is yellow, and made of the middlemost Bark of the Tree <HI>Avo,</HI> almost in the same manner like that of <HI>Europe,</HI> but with trou∣ble and preparation;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paper made.</NOTE> that is, They boyl the Bark two days in a great Kettle, with very strong Lye of the Ashes of the Tree; afterwards, being tender and supple, they wash it in clear Water, and then in a Wooden Mortar beat it to Pap, which they lay together upon a Sieve, or Canvas, made of small thin Reeds put together, to drain; and afterwards upon a Leaf of <HI>Balisier,</HI> anoint∣ed with Oyl of <HI>Menachil,</HI> and laid to dry in the Sun: As soon as it is dry, they draw it through a thick Decoction of Rice, to prevent sinking of the Ink, and then again lay it to dry, pressing it flat and even.</P>
<P>Their Ink is made of the Decoction of the Wood <HI>Arandrantes</HI> (of which the Grandees build their Houses) and the Gum <HI>Carabe</HI> comes from it,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ink made.</NOTE> which they let stand till the thinner and more subtle parts exhaled, it becomes thick again. This Ink proves very good and durable, though not so black as ours in <HI>Europe;</HI> but the addition of a little Copperas makes it a pure Black. It hath no need of Gum, the Wood of which being boyl'd hath enough of it self; and if it chance to be dry'd, they boyl it up with a little Water, and it becomes as good as at first.</P>
<P>Their Writing-Pens are made of <HI>Bamboes</HI> Reeds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writing-Pens.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Voulou;</HI> of which, cutting off a Piece the length of ones Hand, they shape a Pen as we do, fit and convenient to write with.</P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>Madagascar</HI> number or reckon like the <HI>Europeans,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atithmetick.</NOTE> from one to Ten; and to Ten they add One, Two, and so the following Numbers to Twenty, in this manner: <HI>Issa,</HI> or <HI>Irache,</HI> is One; <HI>Roe,</HI> Two; <HI>Telon,</HI> Three; <HI>Ef∣fats,</HI> Four; <HI>Luui,</HI> Five; <HI>Enem,</HI> Six; <HI>Fiton,</HI> Seven; <HI>Valou,</HI> Eight; <HI>Siui,</HI> Nine; <HI>Foulo,</HI> Ten; <HI>Irach-foulo-ambi,</HI> or <HI>Iraiche amainifoulo,</HI> Eleven; <HI>Roe foulo pambi,</HI> Twelve; <HI>Roepoulo,</HI> Twenty; <HI>Telou ambi,</HI> Thirty; <HI>Effats poulo,</HI> Forty; <HI>Zatou,</HI> An hundred; <HI>Armou,</HI> A thousand; <HI>Alen,</HI> An hundred thousand. Indeed the <HI>Blacks</HI> of the Mountains, or on that side of the Countrey of <HI>Machicore,</HI> where nothing is Planted nor Sow'n, know not how to keep any Account.</P>
<P>They use also divers Weights,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weight.</NOTE> but none heavier than a Quarter of an Ounce;
<PB N="703" REF="433"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> for the Ounces, half, and whole Pound they use not. With these they weigh on∣ly Gold and Silver. A Quarter of an Ounce they call <HI>Sompi;</HI> a Half-ounce, <HI>Vari;</HI> a Grain, <HI>Sacare;</HI> a Half-grain, <HI>Nanqui;</HI> six Grains, <HI>Nanque.</HI></P>
<P>Their Measures are several; <HI>viz.</HI> Rice-measure,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measure.</NOTE> with them call'd <HI>Trouba∣houache,</HI> which is said to be the Kings Bushel; <HI>Moucha,</HI> or <HI>Monca,</HI> a Measure of six Pints of cleansed Rice; <HI>Voule,</HI> Half a Pint; <HI>Zatow</HI> is an hundred <HI>Voules,</HI> and therewith they mete unbeaten Rice.</P>
<P>The Measure for Clothing, Cords, and other things to be estimated by Length, they name <HI>Refe,</HI> and contains a Fathom; but Ells, Feet, or Inches they have no knowledge of.</P>
<P>They set forth Lands, not by Rods, Perches, and Acres; but by the quantity of Rice that may be Sow'n upon it.</P>
<P>The Trade of these Islanders one among another consists in exchanging Wares for Wares; for Money,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchandise.</NOTE> or Coyn of Gold and Silver, they have none; and if they get any of Foreign People, they melt it, and make thereof Bracelets and Armlets: But especially they use Glass Beads, and other Commodities which the <HI>French</HI> bring to them, in stead of Money, to buy Oxen, Cotton, Silk Clothes, Iron <HI>Assagays,</HI> or Lances, Bills, Knives, and other Necessaries. Those that have need of Cotton, bring to the Places where it is to be had, Rice, or Beasts; and they that have need of Beasts, or of Rice, come with Cotton to the Places where Rice and Beasts are plenty, to barter one for the other. They exchange also Gold and Silver, for Copper and Iron: But this onely among themselves; for with Foreigners they neither do, nor care to deal: So that hitherto in that Countrey there hath little Merchandise of consequence been discover'd, al∣though there grows indubitably Sapphyres, Rubies, Smaragdines, Cornelians, and other Precious Stones, as appears by the Trials which the <HI>French</HI> have made of them, and sent into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The most desired Merchandises, and by the Islanders best liked, are red Beads of all Sorts, Sizes, and Colours, pierc'd with Holes, that they may be strung
<PB N="704" REF="434"/>into Bracelets; large and yellow Brass Wyre, and several other small Wares; as yellow little Brass Chains, Scissors, Knives, Bills, Hatchets, Hammers, Nails, Padlocks, and several other Trinkets, which with great Profit are exchanged and traded for against their Island Commodities.</P>
<P><HI>Flaccourt,</HI> in his Deseription of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> judgeth this Island to be of great concernment, for the advan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and settling of Trade on the Coast of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> the <HI>Persian Gulph,</HI> and other Places of the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> and might bring great Advantage and Profit, by Wood for building of Ships, that might be carried from thence to all the aforesaid Places, to exchange for other Com∣modities: He adds moreover, <HI>That this Island may serve for a Ladder or Step, as may be said, whereby to climb to the Trade and Voyages of the East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>All their Wealth consists in the foresaid Goods,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> as also in Axes, Knives, Bills, sharp Iron and Steel Spades, Clothes, Oxen, Fields to plant Rice and <HI>Ig∣names</HI> in, and abundance of Slaves. The <HI>Zafferamini</HI> possess the most Gold, which they keep as much hidden as they can from the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>No Eminent Person upon the whole Island is without some Gold of his An∣cestors, which no way assimilates our <HI>European</HI> Gold, but is much paler, and al∣most as soon melted as Lead; they dig it out of the Ground in several Places. They have some Gold in <HI>Manghabei;</HI> but it lieth buried in their Church-yards, and they dare not bring it to light from thence, alledging, They are unworthy of it.</P>
<P>Most esteem the reddest Silver higher than the finest; but the People of <HI>Anossi</HI> can well tell how to distinguish it: yet their Goldsmiths would not know how to work <HI>European</HI> Gold, because they say it is too difficult to melt. That of ours they call <HI>Voulamena Voutroua;</HI> but their own, <HI>Ahetslaua,</HI> and <HI>Lit∣charongha,</HI> or <HI>Voulamena Madecasse.</HI></P>
<P>In Military Affairs these People know nothing;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of their Wars.</NOTE> but in such Cases, by sud∣den Attempts coming upon their Enemies unawares, and by surprise; assem∣bling privately, and marching by secret and unfrequented ways in the Woods. When they come to the Enemies Quarters, they make their Assault with a hi∣deous and horrible Cry; and being enter'd, kill all that come next to hand, not sparing Infants at their Mothers Breasts; exercising this Cruelty with pur∣pose to extirpate the whole Generation of their Enemies, for fear that the Suc∣cessors, sooner or later, if they left them alive, might take Revenge.</P>
<P>They often send Spies into their Enemies Quarters, to know his Condition, and where the chiefest Town is, and most Cattel; and therefore at such time they all drive them into the Mountain, to which access is difficult. They send out sometimes Parties, twenty, thirty, or forty of a Company, to plunder small Villages, and lay the subdu'd Towns in Ashes: These Parties they style <HI>Tafichemanthy,</HI> that is, <HI>A secret Army.</HI></P>
<P>These come usually provided with <HI>Auli</HI> and <HI>Moussanes,</HI> that is, with Sorcery, and written <HI>Arabick</HI> Letters, with firm belief, That these Letters will do their Enemies much annoyance, <HI>viz.</HI> take away their courage, cause them to die by Sickness, and at least be the chiefest cause of their destruction; whereas, to them, on the other side, it gives Courage, and brings all Success.</P>
<P>Their Arms are various,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> according to the several Countreys. In the Terri∣tory of <HI>Androbeizaha,</HI> they use a great <HI>Assagay,</HI> arm'd at the end with a broad and long sharp Iron Head, and carry besides ten or fifteen <HI>Fiteracks,</HI> or small Casting-Darts, as also a great Javelin, call'd <HI>Renelefo,</HI> that is, <HI>The Mother of Assagays.</HI></P>
<PB N="703" REF="434"/>
<P>In <HI>Manghafia</HI> they use a round Shield, and great <HI>Canbahi,</HI> or Javelin: So do they also in <HI>Ampatre, Mahafalle, Machicore,</HI> and <HI>Andribeizaha;</HI> but the Countreys of <HI>Anachimoussi, Eringdranea,</HI> and <HI>Vohits-anghombe,</HI> afford the best-arm'd and most undaunted Soldiers.</P>
<P>On that side of the River <HI>Mananghourou,</HI> three Miles below <HI>Galemboulou,</HI> are a Generation of about four or five hundred strong, very undaunted, which fight with Bowes, Arrows, and Darts. Those of <HI>Manghafia,</HI> up Northwards to the end of the Island, fight Foot to Foot, onely with an <HI>Assagay,</HI> under shelter of a round Shield. Those of <HI>Manamboulle,</HI> the most Warlike and un∣daunted of all, fight both at a distance, and at hand.</P>
<P>In Battel they keep no Order, Ranks, or File, but Fight in Crowds, every one resolving to do some Execution. When any fall down wounded, they set up their Throats with a horrible cry; and no Slave, how mean soever he be, but sticks his <HI>Assagay</HI> in the Body of the languishing Person.</P>
<P>While the Men stay in the Wars, the Women cease not night and day to Dance, and neither sleep nor eat in their Huts; nor, be they never so addicted to Venereal sports, will they at that time have to do with any other Man, be∣lieving if they should, their Husbands would either be slain or wounded in the War.</P>
<P>When any great Man finds his Power too weak to follow the War any longer, he sends one to the Enemy with some Presents to desire Peace, and to appoint a Day for a Treaty, upon the concluding whereof, they meet one an∣other on the Shore of a River, each with all his People and Soldiers, standing as ready for a Battel; where each of them kill a Heifer, and reciprocally send a piece of Silver to eat, making deep Asseverations, and high Oaths, that if they purpose any longer to continue the Wars, to rob one another of their Cattel, or make use of Sorcery or Poysoning to damnifie each others Countrey, then that the Silver given each of them at present may cause them to burst; that God may withdraw his hand from them; that they may be brought to destruction by their Enemies, and their Generations and Posterity come to an end. But if one of them be overcome, so that he can no longer maintain the War, then he must submit, and after sending one of his People for safe Conduct, go himself in Person thither; and then the Vanquisher gives the Vanquished the Liver to eat, for a Confirmation that he will remain faithful to him: Whereas yet oftentimes these Oathes are very sleightly accounted, the better afterwards to betray one another; wherefore they also, notwithstanding their Oath, stand upon their Guard.</P>
<P>They have some superficial knowledge of the Course of the Heavens,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knowledge of the Stars.</NOTE> and of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> being distributed into twelve Signs, which by the <HI>Ombyasses,</HI> or Priests, are call'd <HI>Vintangs,</HI> and have the following Appellations; <HI>Viz.</HI></P>

<P>The New Year beginneth with them at the New Moon in <HI>March;</HI> but they have a Reckoning by Fasting-time, as also by the Days of the Week, beginning with <HI>Friday.</HI></P>
<P>The Religion both of <HI>Whites</HI> and <HI>Blacks</HI> consists onely in Superstition, with∣out the use of Churches or Prayers; yet they observe Circumcision.</P>
<P>They know and believe indeed, That there is a God, who hath made Hea∣ven and Earth, and all Creatures, and innumerable Angels; but reverence or worship him not: They live according to the Law of Nature, without fear∣ing him; but make indeed Confession of their Sins, especially decripit old Men, upon their Death-Beds. They believe also, That there is a Devil, whom they greatly fear, and call <HI>Taiwaddey:</HI> That God is all Good, and doth no Evil: That he gives Life to Men, and all Creatures, and bereaves them of it again at his pleasure: That the Devil is the Author of all Evil and Mischief: That he sends all Sicknesses and Mishaps into the World; causeth all Quarrels, Thefts, and Murthers; and is the Original of Evil: Therefore they Sacrifice unto him, to appease him; they pray first to him, and name the Devil, before God: But they Pray also to a Third Power, under the Name of <HI>Dian Manang,</HI> that is, <HI>God, or Lord of Riches,</HI> which they acknowledge to be <HI>Gold;</HI> which when they see, or have in their Hand, with great Devotion they hold over their Heads, and kiss it. They believe there are innumerable An∣gels and Ministers of God, which do move the Heavens, the Starry Firma∣ment, and Planets; and govern the Air, Rain, Wind, Water, and Earth; guard Mens Lives and Habitations, and defend them from all Mischances in all their Enterprises, either on Water or Land, and in their Houses.</P>
<P>They make the Spirits or Devils,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirits are seven-fold.</NOTE> as well good as bad, Seven-fold: The first are the foremention'd Angels, call'd in their Language <HI>Malainghka,</HI> which are good Angels, and never do any Evil; every one with them is known by a particular Name, as <HI>Ramichail, Ragi-bourail, Ranail, Rafil, &amp;c.</HI> that is, <HI>Michael, Gabriel, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Spirits of the second Order, call'd <HI>Coucoulampou,</HI> they say are beneath the Host of Angels, and invisible to Men; but nevertheless, Corporeal; That they dwell in solitary places, and make themselves known to all those to whom they would shew any particular Friendship; That there are Male and Female among them, and they marry one among another, beget Children, die after a long time, and as Men, expect after this Life Salvation or Damnation, accord∣ing as they have lived well or ill; That they eat without distinction all sorts of Animate or Inanimate Creatures, without suspicion of any of them being hurtful to their Bodily Wellfare; That they are subject to no Sickness, as void for the most part of any Accidents; yet they die, and their Lives are re∣strain'd within certain Limits of Time.</P>
<P>The fifth Rank or Order of Angels are call'd <HI>Angats,</HI> which signifies
<PB N="607" REF="436"/>a kind of Separation, or indeed the same with our Ghosts.</P>
<P>The sixth are call'd <HI>Saccara,</HI> and no other than the Devils or Evil-Spirits, which use to Possess and afflict Men, Women, and Children: They see them come like Fiery-Dragons, which Possess them eight, nay, fifteen days; when they are Possess'd by them, they give them an <HI>Assagay</HI> or Lance in their hands, with which they continually go about Singing and Dancing, with strange con∣tortions of their bodies. Men and Women of the Town flock round about the Possess'd Man or Woman, who also Dance and imitate those Postures by the beat of the Drum.</P>
<P>The seventh sort of Spirits are call'd <HI>Biles,</HI> being, as they say, an infinite number, but all under a Supream, who is the broacher of all evil; so that he seems to be <HI>Lucifer,</HI> or the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>They believe, That God after the Creation of Heaven, Earth, and all Crea∣tures, Created <HI>Adam</HI> of Earth, and plac'd him in Paradise, which they imagine to be in the Moon, or in the Sun; and after his setling there, forbade him ei∣ther to eat or drink, because he had no need to do so; though they say there were four Rivers, one of Milk, one of Wine, one of Honey, and one of Oil; besides all sorts of Fruits in abundance. But the Devil (thus they relate the manner of the Fall) with subtilty and treachery, went to <HI>Adam,</HI> and said, <HI>Why eat ye not of all these good Fruits? Why do you not drink of that good Wine, and Milk, and taste this delicious Honey and Oil?</HI> Whereupon <HI>Adam</HI> answer'd, <HI>That God had for∣bidden him, which he durst not disobey.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil thus driven away, staid about two hours; then came again to <HI>Adam,</HI> and said to him, <HI>That he came from God, to give him leave to eat of all that he had a mind to. Adam</HI> thus tempted to taste thereof, eat, and satisfi'd himself to the full; but after the digestion of the Food, he had a provocation and desire to ease himself, which of necessity he must do in Paradise; whereupon, instantly the Devil went, and complain'd to God against <HI>Adam's</HI> bewraying of his <HI>Eden;</HI> so that God for that cause drave him out of Paradise, and sent him into the Coun∣trey, where he gat a swelling in the Calf of his Leg, which continu'd six Moneths; and when the swelling brake, there came forth a young Maid, whereupon he sent the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> to God, to ask what he should do with that Maid; and the Angel return'd answer, <HI>That he should bring her up, and when she came to years of maturity, should Marry her;</HI> which he did, and nam'd her <HI>Ra∣bouna,</HI> that is, <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>After the current of some time, she lay In of two Sons, which being grown to a man-like stature, the Devil who hath a thousand Tricks, betray'd them in this manner; He gave them an <HI>Assagay</HI> or Javelin in their hands, arm'd with Iron at both ends, and rais'd a quarrel betwixt them two, so that they both took hold of the <HI>Assagays,</HI> and each took one end to pull it out of the others hands; but the Irons not fast Rivetted, by hard pulling came off, where each of them now having one, they stuck one another in the Belly, and both died of their Wounds. These two Brothers were <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel.</HI></P>
<P>They add moreover, That <HI>Adam</HI> had many Children, which multiply'd ex∣ceedingly; but because Men were evil, and would no more know God, he sent a Floud or Deluge upon the Earth; having before commanded <HI>Noah</HI> to build a great Ship, to save himself, with all his Friends and Family, Women and Children, and many Beasts, a Male and Female of every sort; then God over∣whelm'd presently the whole face of the Earth, and all the remainder of Beasts, except four Mountains, that is to say, the Mountain <HI>Zaballicaf,</HI> in the North;
<PB N="708" REF="437"/><HI>Zaballicatoure,</HI> in the South; <HI>Zaballiraf,</HI> in the West; and <HI>Zaballibazani,</HI> in the East: whereupon, nevertheless none could preserve their lives.</P>
<P>After the ending of the Floud, <HI>Noah</HI> came out of his Ship, went to dwell at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and came from thence to <HI>Mecha.</HI></P>
<P><HI>God</HI> (say they) <HI>gave four sorts of Writings to</HI> Noah, <HI>who embraced the Law; The first call'd</HI> Alifurcan, <HI>or</HI> Alcaron, <HI>was for</HI> Noah: <HI>The second</HI> Soratsi, <HI>for</HI> Moses: <HI>The third</HI> Zonboura, <HI>for</HI> David: <HI>And the fourth</HI> Alindzini, <HI>for Christ, whom they call</HI> Rahitsa. They say also, <HI>That Jesus Christ was sent by God into the world, without being begotten by any Man, but Born by the Virgin</HI> Mary; <HI>which brought him forth without pain, and remain'd a Virgin, calling her</HI> Ramariamia: <HI>That Christ was a Man, and God: That he was Crucifi'd by the Jews; but that God did not permit that he should die, but would have the Body of a Malefactor found in his place.</HI> They observe the Sa∣turday like the <HI>Jews,</HI> and not the Friday like the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> If they would take in hand a Journey or matter of consequence, they take council of their <HI>Squilles,</HI> that is, of Geomancy or Black-Art, or rather of <HI>Auli,</HI> which they carry about with them in small Boxes. They offer great Sacrifices of Beasts, call'd <HI>Mitaha,</HI> at the entrance upon new Built Houses; at the Harvest of their Fruits of the Field; their Wives being with Child; at the lusty growing of their Plants; the Burial of their Dead, and Marriage: Fast-Days, by them call'd <HI>Ramahana,</HI> or <HI>Miafauthe,</HI> and by the <HI>Turks, Ramedan,</HI> which they observe with great Ceremony, but not in any set Moneths, but now in one, and then in an∣other, according to the position and order of the year.</P>
<P>They Circumcise their Children with great Formality commonly in <HI>May,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumcision.</NOTE> when it is <HI>Fridays</HI> Year, for by the days of the Week they reckon their Years; especially the People of <HI>Anossy</HI> and <HI>Matatane;</HI> for all the other Circumcise at all times: To the performance whereof come all the Friends in Consanguinity and Alliance of the Child to the Circumcision into the Town, to which the Parents bring Wine, and present an Ox or Heifer for every Infant; but poor people less.</P>
<P>The Men play and exercise with <HI>Assagays</HI> or Lances, among which the Drums, whom they stile <HI>Ompivango,</HI> beat the <HI>Azontake</HI> or Drums, made of a hol∣lowed Trunk of a Tree, cover'd over with two Skins; the one of an Ox, and the other of a Goat, upon which they Tabor at one end with a Stick, and at the other with their Hand; the Female Relations Dance round about those who exercise with <HI>Assagays,</HI> and use divers Gestures and strange Postures; These Pranks finish'd, all the young Company Dance and Sing again; then the Ma∣ster of the Town (who must celebrate the Circumcision) beginning to drink of the Wine of Honey or Meath, follow to guzzle as much as possible, for they that Drunk most, are the greatest honor to the Assembly. In the Evening, Oxen are kill'd to eat in the day, sometimes to the number of two hundred. The next Morning (the Feast-day) every one remains quiet; but the Fathers and Mothers sometime make their Children ready in the mean time, and the Mo∣thers sleep that night with their Children, in the <HI>Lapa,</HI> that is, the Church, be∣ing a place erected a Moneth before, with divers Ceremonies, by the Fathers and Uncles of the Children, to be Circumcised. No Father may approach the Mother that night, nor know any woman; and no Woman, Maid, or Man, who have used incontinency, must dare to joyn himself in person at the Cir∣cumcision, for they are possess'd with this Superstitious Opinion, that then the blood of the Fore-skin of the Child will not stench, but the Child die: Nei∣ther may any person present wear any red thing on his body at that time, or if they do, it must be very close from sight.</P>

<P>Early, at break of Day, Men, Women, Maids, and all others, Bathe them∣selves, and beating their Drums at Sun-rise, chop up some short Prayers, and the Circumciser himself utters aloud, <HI>Salama, Zahanhare Zahomissabots Anauhanau, Nambouatsitangho, amini Tombuc, Zahomitoulou bouzonhamiuau,</HI> &amp;c. Which is, <HI>Be thou Magnified, O my God; I draw near with my Prayers to thee, thou hast Created our Hands and our Feet; I beseech thee forgiveness of our Sins; I kneel down before thee; I do Circumcise these Children this day,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Afterwards they bring the Children into the <HI>Lapa,</HI> adorn'd and dress'd with Corals and Bracelets, Pretious Stones, and other Ornaments about their Necks: Here they stay till the tenth hour of the Morning, with an empty body, which they can discern by the shadow of a Man in the Sun, standing straight upright; for they measure the shadow with their Feet, which they call <HI>Liha,</HI> or <HI>Pas,</HI> which being nine of their own Feets length, is the time of the Circumcision. Then the Drums beat, and the Circumciser puts on his Garments, and binds a Fillet of great strong white Cotton-Yarn to his left Arm, to scour his Knife. At last, every Father takes his Child in his Arms, and going a Procession through the <HI>Lapa,</HI> passing in at the Western Door, and out again at the Eastern, ten by ten, one after another twice: After some short pause, they begin two other for the Oxen which are for the Sacrifice; and with the left hand of the Child touch their right Horn, as they lie upon the ground, with their Feet ty'd together: Then all the people are bid to clear the place, and a large Ring made; whereupon the Circumciser appears with his Knife, to cut off the Fore-skin of every Child, which the Uncle of the Child receives, and lays into the white and yealk of a Hens-Egg which he holds in his hand; but a <HI>Rhoandrian</HI> or <HI>Anakandrian</HI> kills the Cattel, and cuts for every Child a Hens throat, and lets the Blood drop upon every Wound; and another puts upon it the Juyce of a certain Herb call'd <HI>Hota,</HI> a kind of Clover-Leaf. If the Child be a Slave, and hath no Uncle, then the Fore-skin is thrown upon the ground; This day they keep so holy, that no Sport is made, nor none then drink beyond the measure of hillarity.</P>
<PB N="710" REF="438"/>
<P>The Priests call'd by them <HI>Ombyasses,</HI> and by the <HI>Moors, Marabauts;</HI> are of two sorts, that is, <HI>Ombiasses Ompanorats,</HI> and <HI>Ombyasses Omptifiquili;</HI> the <HI>Ompanorats</HI> are Scribes, who can write <HI>Arabick</HI> very Expertly; they have many Books, where∣in are some pieces of the <HI>Alcaron:</HI> most of them understand the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue, which they teach, together with Writing.</P>
<P>Several Offices are conferr'd upon the <HI>Ombyasses, Ompanorats,</HI> which very much agree with the Church-Offices among Christians; as <HI>Male, Ombyasse, Tibou, Mouladzi, Faquihi, Catibou, Loulamaba, Sabaha, Talisman. Male</HI> is a Clerk, which onely teacheth to Write: <HI>Ombyasse,</HI> a Master of Arts: <HI>Tibou,</HI> an under Dea∣con: <HI>Mouladzi,</HI> a Deacon: <HI>Faquihi,</HI> a Priest: <HI>Catibou,</HI> a Bishop: <HI>Loulamaba,</HI> an Arch-Bishop: <HI>Sabaha,</HI> a Pope.</P>
<P>These People cure the Sick, make <HI>Hiridzi,</HI> or <HI>Talismans,</HI> or <HI>Massasser</HI>-Robes, which are certain Charms or Spells, written with <HI>Arabick</HI> Letters, which they sell to the Grandees and Rich men, with promise that they shall be freed from a thousand Mischiefs, Sicknesses, Thunder, Fire, Enemies, yea from Death it self; though they know not how to preserve themselves from it.</P>
<P>These Cheaters make great gain of those Letters, receiving for them Beasts, Gold, Silver, Clothes, and all Conveniencies. The people stand in great fear of these <HI>Ombyasses,</HI> and hold them for Sorcerers and Witches; as also the Gran∣dees of the Countrey, make use of them against the <HI>French,</HI> but without any effect; alledging, that their Sorcery can do nothing upon them, because they eat Swines-Flesh, and are of another Religion. It chanc'd, that these <HI>Ombyasses</HI> close under the Fort of the <HI>French</HI> (to drive them away) had brought Baskets full of Papers written with <HI>Arabick</HI> Letters, Eggs laid upon a Friday, fill'd over with Characters, and <HI>Arabick</HI> Writing, Earthen Pots never yet set upon the Fire, written upon within and without, Biers to carry the Dead, written upon, <HI>Ca∣noos,</HI> Girdles, Scissers, Pinsers of Iron to pluck the Hairs out; In brief, nothing was omitted that they thought expedient for the Work, yet without any other effect, than the Pastime of the <HI>French</HI> at their ridiculous Vanity.</P>
<P>These <HI>Ombyasses Ompanorats,</HI> are the usual Physitians who visit the Sick, and give them Medicines, being Decoctions of Herbs and Roots. They also Cure Wounds, and write Charms with <HI>Arabick</HI> Characters, which moisten'd with Water, they hang about the Necks and Middles of the Sick, to expel all Sick∣nesses and evil Influences. They make likewise Geomantick Images, to find out the time of the Disease, and to discover the Remedies fit for the Malady. If the Sick recover not as they expect, they acquaint him that he wants somewhat, and so set upon the Work anew, either till he die, or grow well of himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ombyasses,</HI> in the mean time, get both from the Patient and his Friends all they require, as Gold, Silver, Corral, Cows, Clothes, Girdles, and other things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ombyasses Ompanorats,</HI> among the People of <HI>Matatane</HI> keep publick Schools to teach Children.</P>
<P>The <HI>Omptifiquili</HI> are commonly <HI>Negro's</HI> and <HI>Anakandrians,</HI> which undertake the practice of Geomancy, or Soothsaying, in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Squi∣li,</HI> and do such like Feats, as in <HI>Europe</HI> the Books of Geomancy express; onely they erect their Schemes or Work upon a Plank, strew'd over with Sand, whereupon they make Figures with their finger, setting down the Day, Hour, Moneth, Planet, and Signs that have Dominion over the Hour, according to which they Presage.</P>
<P>Strange things are attempted in this Art, yet they seldom hit upon the truth,
<PB N="711" REF="438"/>but rather judge blindly by guess; nevertheless they are esteem'd by all.</P>
<P>There is another sort of <HI>Ombyasses</HI> among the <HI>Negro's,</HI> which the Sick also send to, yet can neither Write nor Read, but make onely Geomantick Figures, and use Crystals, Topazes, Eagle-Stones, Amethysts, and others, which they call by the general name of <HI>Filaha;</HI> making the people believe, God sends them these Stones by the Thunder, to work Cures by; which perswasion hath taken so deep root in the hearts of the Islanders, that they cannot be drawn to believe the contrary.</P>
<P>They have great glistering Crystals, but foul and cloudy, which they say are <HI>Terachs,</HI> that is, having others within: when they make Figures, they have one of these Stones in the corner of their Tables, saying, That it hath power to bring activity into their fingers.</P>
<P><HI>Vincent le Blank,</HI> and <HI>Casper de Saint Bernardino,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> set down six Kingdoms in this Island, which Kings continually wage War one against the other: But <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> affirms, That in his time it was govern'd by four <HI>Cheques;</HI> but at this day every Territory hath a peculiar Lord or <HI>Dian,</HI> who usually sets over every Town under his Jurisdiction a particular <HI>Philoubei,</HI> that is, Bailiff of the Town.</P>
<P>In the whole there is not a foot breadth of Land but belongs to some Lord or other, so that it is an error and mistake to say, that every one may make use of as much Land as he will.</P>
<P>There are not found in this whole Island any written Laws, but all is done according to the Law of Nature, being three-fold; <HI>Massindili,</HI> or the Princes Law; <HI>Massinpah,</HI> the natural Law of particular people, which is no other than their own way; and <HI>Massintane,</HI> the Law or Custom of the Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>The Princes Law, or <HI>Massindili</HI> is a compound word of <HI>Massin,</HI> that signifies Law or Custom; and <HI>Hadili</HI> that signifies Command, being nothing else but ar∣bitrary Will, grounded nevertheless upon Reason, consisting in the doing every one Right, to determine differences; such as have done others wrong, to punish them in their Estates or Goods. A Thief must recompence his theft fourfold, if he have wherewithal, if not, he must pay for it with his life, or be his Slave which he stole the Goods from.</P>
<P>The Natural Law, or <HI>Massinpah,</HI> concerns every ones particular method in Working, Speaking, Merchandize, Gesture, and manner of Life.</P>
<P><HI>Massintane,</HI> is the settled Custom of the Countrey, not onely there, but in more civilized Places, held for a firm Law in all Cases. This here extends to the way of Planting necessary Provisions, Building of Towns, Wars, publick Re∣joycings, Dancings, Exercises of Arms, and many other matters.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of this <HI>Massintane</HI> hath so prevail'd, that the Law of the Prince stands upon no other foundation, so that it cannot be alter'd; nor indeed will they alter it for any cause whatsoever: That which they have receiv'd from hand to hand, by Tradition from their Fore-fathers, they esteem more than any thing else that can be taught them: As for instance, in the manner of Til∣ling their Ground, if any should tell them, that the Earth must be digg'd deep, or stirr'd and broken with a Plough, they would not hearken thereto, but in∣stantly reply, Their Ancestors us'd no such Custom.</P>
<P>The Person that is hurt or wrong'd may do himself right, without bring∣ing the Offender before his Lord; for they make no more of killing a Thief, than they do about a venomous Serpent, or other Vermin.</P>
<PB N="712" REF="439"/>
<P>Perjur'd Persons and breakers of their Oath, are punish'd with heavy Pe∣nalties, and the Women sometime kill'd by their Husbands for it.</P>
<P>When a Marry'd Woman departs from her Husband, and hath a Child by another man, that Child must belong to the Marry'd Husband, till the Woman (without consent) Marrieth another; to which nevertheless he will not agree, till his <HI>Tacq,</HI> that is, the Brides Portion which he paid to the Womans Father at his Marriage, be restor'd to him again.</P>
<P>These arise also continual quarrels and differences among particular people upon Trifles; as either about the Cattel, which run into one or others <HI>Torraks,</HI> and spoil or eat up their Rice, or Slander and wrong; or if one <HI>Neger</HI> steps over another lying on the Ground, or treads upon his Legs without speaking, Jossles against another unawares; for all which he is liable to be punish'd by the Judge.</P>

<HEAD>The Island of Saint Mary, otherwise called Nossi Hibrahim.</HEAD>
<P>THe Isle of <HI>St. Mary,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Nossi Hibrahim,</HI> that is, <HI>Abraham's-Isle,</HI> lieth from the sixteenth to the seventeenth degree South-Latitude, opposite to the River <HI>Manangare,</HI> and stands the nearest from <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI> two small Miles, and at the farthest four; containing in length from South to North, about eleven; and in breadth, from East to West, full two Miles.</P>
<P>To the South of this Island, lieth another small one, in the shape of a Tre-Angle, separated by a Channel of thirty yards broad, and two foot deep in some places, and in others deeper. This Island hath curious Meadows with Grass, where the Cattel of St. <HI>Maries</HI> Isle go to Pasture.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>St. Mary</HI> stands encompass'd with Rocks, over which, at the time of High-Water the <HI>Canoos</HI> go, but at Low-Tide they are dangerous, within a foot, or half a foot of the Surface. On the Shore are found Rocks of white Corral, which the <HI>Negro's</HI> seek, and sell to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The whole is cut thorow by small Rivers and Springs, by which means, to∣gether with its natural fatness, the Ground proves infinitely fertile, and all over Sown with Rice, whereof sometimes they gather two Crops in a year; there are also large Sugar-Canes, Pease, <HI>Bananoes, Ananassen;</HI> and better to Bake than in any place of <HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>The Air is very moist, so that scarce one day in the year passeth without Rain, and sometimes it Showres six days together without ceasing.</P>
<P>The Cattel are very large and fat, feeding at pleasure.</P>
<P>On the Easterly Shore much Ambergreece hath been found, of which the <HI>Negro's</HI> make Burnt-Offerings on the <HI>A Mounouques,</HI> or Burying-places of their Fore-fathers. Besides, several sorts of Gums which they use for sweet Scents; and likewise <HI>Taccamahacca</HI> in great abundance. There grows a Tree, by the Natives call'd <HI>Thionti,</HI> and its Fruit <HI>Voathions,</HI> which is no sooner fallen from the same, but it Roots in the Earth and makes such a close Thicket, that it is impossible to go thorow it.</P>
<PB N="713" REF="439"/>
<P>There are about ten or twelve Villages Inhabited since the <HI>French</HI> have had their abode there; so that the Governor of <HI>Antongil,</HI> which used formerly to War against this Island continually, dare not come thither for fear of the <HI>French:</HI> The whole contains about six hundred Inhabitants, which call them∣selves <HI>Zaffe-Hibrahim,</HI> that is, <HI>Children of Abraham.</HI> The Chief Commander hath to name <HI>Raignasse,</HI> or <HI>Raniassa,</HI> Son of <HI>Ratsiminon,</HI> that is, <HI>Head,</HI> because onely acknowledged by them as Head of the Stock of <HI>Abraham,</HI> in this Island and <HI>Ma∣dagascar.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Islanders</HI> maintain themselves by Planting of Rice, <HI>Ignames, Bananoes,</HI> Su∣gar-Canes, Pease, and Beans, and Fishing for <HI>Houzites,</HI> a sort of Fish, which they carry to sell at <HI>St. Lawrence;</HI> paying to the Governor the fifth part for Tri∣bute, which also they do of Rice, and other Plants.</P>

<HEAD>The Island of Maskareigne, otherwise called BOURBON.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Maskareigne,</HI> or <HI>Maskarenhas,</HI> so call'd from the first Disco∣verer, a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> out of the Family of <HI>Maskarenhas,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Apollime,</HI> but by the <HI>French</HI> from the houses of <HI>Bourbon, Isle de Bourbon;</HI> who in the Year Fifteen hundred sixty nine, by <HI>Flakour</HI> then Commander of the Island of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> for the <HI>French East-India</HI> Company, took possession of it for them.</P>
<P>It lieth to the East of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> in one and twenty degrees and a half South-Latitude; being fifteen Leagues long and ten broad, and full eight days Journey in circumference.</P>
<P>There is not one convenient Haven, by reason of the Rocks on the Shore, which makes the coming of Ships to this Island oftentimes dangerous; but there are several Roads, the best of which lieth West, and North-East; the next is on the Northside, and another on the Southside, surrounded with Rocks, with an entrance scarce wide enough for one Ship to come in at; near which the <HI>French</HI> have built a Chappel for <HI>St. Paul.</HI></P>
<P>At the Southside of this Island stands a Mountain which continually Burns, and Vomits out Fire; as another on the Island <HI>Del Fuoga,</HI> one of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, and the Mountain <HI>Hekla</HI> in <HI>Ysland;</HI> from the South to the Eastside lieth a Tract of Land of twenty Miles, quite burnt up by the sultry heat of the Air; however, this Countrey doth seem to have been very good formerly.</P>
<P>The Burning begins from the South-Point, and takes its course aloft over the Mountains: As you travel cross thorow the Countrey, from the South to the West, you may find a small Tract of Land of about six Miles, wherein is a Lake, whence issues a small River, which runs through all the Countrey.</P>
<P>The Air, though very hot, hath the repute of being healthful, as receiving frequent cooleness from the fresh Breezes arising out of the Mountains. It hath several Rivulets, Brooks, and Springs, which along the Cliffs, and
<PB N="714" REF="440"/>the gaping of the Mountains, pour their Water from one quarter into the other.</P>
<P>The Rivers by the <HI>French</HI> discover'd on the Coast, and flowing into the Sea, are, the grand River <HI>Du Galet,</HI> the <HI>East-River, Stone-Cliffe River,</HI> and the Ri∣ver of <HI>St. John, St. Steven,</HI> and <HI>St. Giles:</HI> It lieth totally desolate, notwith∣standing the <HI>French</HI> have sometimes endeavor'd to have Planted it with some Colonies of People.</P>
<P>This Island boasts an exceeding fertility both of Plants and Beasts: for first, there grows Tobacco as good as any Countrey can afford, abundance of Aloes, <HI>Cubebs,</HI> white-tail Pepper, Ebony, and other Wood, serviceable to build Hou∣ses and Ships, Trees which afford well-scented Gums, <HI>Benzoia,</HI> and others, be∣sides many <HI>Palmito's</HI> and other Fruit-Trees.</P>
<P>They cannot complain for want either of Fish or Flesh, the Rivers plenti∣fully affording the one, and the Land the other, <HI>viz.</HI> wild Swine, very great Sea and Land-Turtles, wild Pigeons and Drones, the fairest Paraketo's in the world, and many other sorts of Fowl: The Sea-shores are full of Goats, which are delicate Meat; yet the Flesh of the wild Swine exceeds all the other for daintiness and wholsomness, according to the relation of those <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which were by the Governor banish'd three years into this Island, where they preserved themselves, onely by this Flesh, without either Bisket or Rice, or tasting any other tame or wild Beast, or Fowl. During their three years continuance there, they averred, that they perceived not the least spice of either Ague or Fever, neither had pain in the Head or Teeth, notwithstanding they went continually naked, bare-footed, and nothing on their Heads; yea, some of them coming sick thither, immediately recover'd health.</P>
<P>In the Year Sixteen hundred fifty four, a <HI>French</HI>-man call'd <HI>Antonis Thaureau,</HI> went with leave of the <HI>French</HI> Governor of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> with seven other of his own Nation, and six <HI>Blacks,</HI> to settle themselves in this Island: After a Journey of twelve days arriving there, they seated themselves at the side of a certain Lake, which mixes its Water with the Sea, at a place where a great <HI>Bay</HI> lieth, a convenient Road for ships, in the West-North-West part of the Island.</P>
<P>They took along with them from <HI>Madagascar</HI> five Cows, with one Calf, and one Steer, which mixed themselves with five and thirty other very fine and fat Steers, which were come of those that had been put on Shore five years be∣fore. They immediately built Huts for their abode, and busied themselves in making of Gardens, and Planting of Tobacco, Melons, and all sorts of Cod-Fruits: but when the Tobacco was almost ripe, the same, with their Huts, was ruin'd by a Heuricane; so that they were necessitated to Build and Plant anew. In the mean time while the Season of Planting came on again, being in <HI>October, November,</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> (for their Harvest is in <HI>April</HI>) the aforesaid <HI>Thaureau,</HI> with some of the other, concluded to take a Journey round about the Island to discover the same exactly, and to take notice of the Countrey; but they found almost nothing but Plants of Aloes: after two days Journey they came to the Sea-coast, which runs from the Point in the North, to the other in the South, five Miles long, convenient for Habitation, and very de∣lightful and pleasant Meadows, water'd by seven very fine Rivers, which take their original out of a great Lake, surrounded with Mountains, where the Standard with the Arms of <HI>France</HI> were set up, by the command of <HI>Flaccourt.</HI></P>
<P>After a stay of two years and eight moneths, without receiving any relief from <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and seeing no other opportunity to get from thence, they be∣took
<PB N="715" REF="440"/>themselves to an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, which put in there in the Year Sixteen hundred fifty eight, and in the Moneth of <HI>May,</HI> together with their six <HI>Blacks,</HI> came to the <HI>English</HI> Fort of <HI>Maderespartan,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> or <HI>Narsinge,</HI> a Mile from the City <HI>St. Thomas</HI> the Apostle of <HI>India,</HI> where they arrived on the twelfth day of the following Moneth, with a great deal of Aloes, Tobacco, and <HI>Benzoin,</HI> in hopes to dispose of those Commodities there; but arriving, they found the contrary, and that one Roll of Tobacco was enough for the whole Coast to make Snuff of, by reason of the little use of it: And likewise the Aloes prov'd a Drug, because it grew there also.</P>

<HEAD>The Island of Mauritius, or Cerne.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Mauritius,</HI> so call'd by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for the Honour and Memory of <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> a Branch from the House of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> not well knowing, and uncertain of its proper Name. Some wrongfully hold it to be the <HI>Cerne</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI> and placed in eighteen Degrees and thirty Minutes of South-Latitude, whereas, according to <HI>Caucha,</HI> it is call'd, <HI>The Island of Apollonie,</HI> and lieth in the Elevation of one and twenty Degrees South-Latitude, close by <HI>Mascaronhas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> first touched upon it in the Year Fifteen hundred ninety eight, the eighteenth of <HI>September,</HI> in their second Voyage to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> under the Command of the Admiral <HI>Jacob Cornelius van Nek.</HI> Its Circumfe∣rence they guess at fifteen Leagues, affording a Haven and convenient Road, but remains void both of Men and Beasts, except Cats.</P>
<P>The Air seems to be good and wholsom; and there is a River found, which takes its orignal out of the Mountains, whereof there are many towards the Sea; yet within the Countrey are very delightful Plains. By reason of the many and high Mountains, the whole lies almost continually cover'd with Snow; and oftentimes there doth such Mists arise from them, that a Man can see no farther than just down before him. The Ground lies very stony, and so overgrown with wild and unfruitful Trees, that it is scarce passable. Among them are found many <HI>Palmito's</HI> and other Trees, with a green Bark, and Wood underneath as black as Pitch, which some have taken for the right Ebony; and other Trees, whose Wood appears of a deep red, or very yellow, like Wax.</P>
<P>Fowl are here innumerable, and so tame and fearless, that they will suffer a Man almost to touch them, as Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, Cranes, gray and speckled Parrots, and strange Birds as big as Swans, with thick Heads, where∣on are Skins like Lappets: In stead of Wings (for they have none) they have upon their sides onely three or four black Quills, and behind, in stead of a Tail,
<PB N="716" REF="441"/>four or five small Feathers, or curl'd Plumes, standing somewhat higher than the other: they have large and thick Feet, with a great and ugly Bill and Eyes; and have commonly a Stone in their Maw as big as ones Fist: the longer the Flesh is boyl'd the harder it grows, except it be the Breast, which is very good to eat. The Sea-men that first saw them, gave them the name of <HI>Loath∣som Fowls.</HI> Bats as big, or rather bigger than Pigeons, with a Head like a Cat, flie there in great numbers, hanging in the Trees, and doing much hurt to other Fowls. Another sort of these are hairy all over their Bodies, like Monkies or Cats, and therefore some have call'd them <HI>Flying Cats,</HI> for they are as big as a Hen or Goose: such as these are found in several places of <HI>Asia,</HI> as in the King∣dom of <HI>Mogor,</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Casmir,</HI> in <HI>Suratta,</HI> and neighboring Islands, and likewise in <HI>Brasile:</HI> they keep in the closest Woods, and hang with their Claws in the day-time on the Branches of Trees, and shew more like hanging Bags than Beasts or Fowls. The <HI>China's</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> eat their Flesh with a great appetite, and report it better and more savoury than that of a Hen: in the nights they miserably torment Cows, Goats and Sheep, by suck∣ing out their Blood.</P>
<P>Fish may be plentifully taken in the Rivers within the Countrey, as without in the Sea, with little pains, two or three Tubs full at one haling; among which the ignorant Sea-men sometimes catch a sort of Fishes of a red colour, but so poysonous, that he that eats of it, hath for some days together a most intolerable pain.</P>
<P>There are also Sea and Land-Turtles, but the best not pallatable, and of an uncouth aspect; but of the first, some have three hundred Eggs in their Bodies, as big as Hen-Eggs, and Shells wherein ten or twelve men can stand, and one of them alive (as they say) can carry seven men.</P>

<P>This Island hath a wholsom Air, many Fountains, Springs, and Brooks, with fresh Water, onely a little brackish at the New and Full-Moon, by rea∣son of the high flowing of the Sea. It rises with Mountains, whose aspiring tops seem to kiss the Clouds, and are commonly cover'd with Snow. The Hills and Dales prove fruitful in all sorts of Plants, and affords the Eye a plea∣sant and delightful sight.

<HEAD>The Island of St. Thomas.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> in <HI>Portuguese, St. Thomee,</HI> because first of all discover'd on that Saints Day; yet <HI>Thevet</HI> calls it <HI>Santas Honore,</HI> and the <HI>Barqarians, Ponkas;</HI> it lieth in the <HI>Ethiopian Sea,</HI> right under the Equi∣noctial Line, (which comes through the City, and the great Church, and there∣fore no Latitude hath been ascribed to it) and not far from the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Lopez Gonsalvez.</HI> It bears an Oval form about thirty Miles in Circumference, and in length and breadth twelve Miles.</P>
<P>The chief City, call'd <HI>Pavosan,</HI> or <HI>Pavaose,</HI> through which run two small Rivers, hath its situation on an even place, on the North-side of the <HI>Bay,</HI> some∣what more longer than round, and about half a days walking in compass; containing about fifteen hundred Houses, every one ten Stories high. On that side towards the Sea-coast defended with some Breast-works of Stone, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Governor raised in the Year Sixteen hundred and seven, commanding every one that passed backwards and forwards by the City, to
<PB N="720" REF="443"/>bring one Stone towards the Building. The Houses are erected of white and hard Wood like Oak, which grows there on the Spot; before, behind, and also on the top, cover'd with Planks made fast together. There stand onely on the whole Island three Stone Houses, in one of which the Governor dwelleth.</P>
<P>The City boasts of three Churches, whereof the biggest is intitled <HI>Conceptio,</HI> or, <HI>The Church of the Conception of the Virgin Mary;</HI> next, the Church of <HI>Isabella,</HI> whereto adjoyns an Hospital, and the Church of <HI>St. Sebastian,</HI> a small one, standing by the Castle. But several other Churches stand without the City, as <HI>St. Anthonies,</HI> two Musquets shot distant; and somewhat nearer, <HI>St. Johns:</HI> then you may see the Church of <HI>Maitre de Dios,</HI> or <HI>The Mother of God;</HI> about a Mile from the City, towards the South-east; and about two Miles from it towards the East, <HI>Trinitado,</HI> or <HI>The holy Trinity;</HI> and about three Miles towards the South-east, the Church of <HI>St. Anna.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle of <HI>St. Sebastian,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle <HI>St. Sebastian.</HI></NOTE> seated on an out-lying Corner, at the North-side of the City and of the Bay, is a handsom Building of Stone, to the heighth of twenty five Foot, and both of it self, and by the conveniency of the place whereon it stands, seems almost impregnable: The Garrison within con∣sists of a hundred Soldiers, well stor'd and provided with Ammunition and Victuals; besides, continual Supplies are, and may be brought thither by Sea without hindrance.</P>
<P>The Ground is moistned by several Brooks and Rivers of clear and fresh Water, to their great enriching.</P>
<P>On the middle of this Island rises a Woody Mountain, continually cover'd with Snow, whence divers Brooks and Streams draw their originals.</P>
<P>The Air is very hot and untemperate, moist, unwholsom, inimical to the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> who seldom attain there to the age of fifty years, whereas the Natives, a People that have but little Blood, oftentimes arrive to above a hundred. Some affirm, that a young Man in his growth coming thither; shall never grow bigger, but always remain at his first Stature; and that a dead Corps laid in the Ground, will rot and decay in four and twenty hours.</P>
<P>The cause of this unwholsomness hath been imagin'd to proceed from the over-great Heats, and damp Fogs. Some have reported, that this malign in∣temperature doth not spread over the whole, but confin'd chiefly to the City, and occasion'd by the low situation thereof: for from the Rain-water which falls down abundantly from the Hills to the Valleys, are exhal'd noysom Va∣pors, which afterwards fall down in the Evenings and Mornings, with an of∣fensive influence; whose fume or dewy stream receiv'd into the Body, corrupts and irritates the Blood: for the avoiding which direful hazards at those times, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> there resident keep within their Houses.</P>
<P>But this Air loses some of these ill qualities in <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> by rea∣son of the South-east and South-west dry and cool Winds; which blowing over from the Coast of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> refresh the Countrey, and clear the Air, to the great advantage of Strangers, although the Natives receive detriment thereby.</P>
<P>These Islanders, as all others under the Equinoctial, have two Winters, not in respect of Cold, but onely of Moistures, one in <HI>March,</HI> and another in <HI>Sep∣tember;</HI> at which time the Sun shines from the Vertical Point upon the Inhabi∣tants Heads, without making a Shadow either to the North or South; which happens twice a year at Noon.</P>
<P>The reason of this double Winter seems to proceed from the violent attra∣ctions of Heat, caus'd by the scorching beams of the Sun, which so fill the Air
<PB N="721" REF="443"/>with watry Exhalations, that the Sun, as clouded therewith, shines not out, and so those dusky Vapors dissolve themselves in great and continuing Rains, the onely sign of Winter, the over-heated Air hardly chill'd thereby.</P>
<P>The rainy Moneths continue from <HI>December</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> when all the low Land lies under Water. Our Summer-Moneths, <HI>May, June, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> make their Spring; and with them Summer begins when the Sun first enters into the beginning of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> and continues till it comes to the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> that is, in <HI>December, January, February,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>March;</HI> and then the Air is very moist and hot, so that Foreigners keep themselves in places under ground, yet oftentimes can neither escape great Sicknesses or Death; where∣as the Natives being of a cold and dry Constitution, live in good health: yet when the heat arrives at the heighth, it makes the Inhabitants themselves so faint, that they can scarce go, and the Ground so hot, that they must wear Shooes with double Soles and thick Corks, to save their Feet from scorching.</P>
<P>The Sicknesses which proceed from the untemperate heat,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unwholsomness of the Air.</NOTE> are burning and pestilential Fevers, seizing Strangers in eight days time, first by shivering and coldness, afterwards with heat through all their Limbs, for two hours toge∣ther, and with such violence, that the infected Party oftentimes on the fourth, or seventh, or at longest on the fifteenth day, dies; but if he out-live that time, he grows well again on a sudden, and so may continue, except he prejudice himself by gluttony or drinking; for the best Medicine is a moderate Diet, to eat little and fast much; besides, to purge the Body with Juice of <HI>Cassia Fi∣stula,</HI> and sometimes to breath a Vein, and take away superfluous Blood.</P>
<P>The Sickness call'd <HI>Bitios de Ku,</HI> ranges here also, being cured with Juice of Lemons, as before related.</P>
<P>The Pox is so customary to the Natives, that they make nothing of it, but suddenly and with great ease cure it, by means of Quicksilver, yet proves mor∣tal to many Strangers; who ought therefore to be very careful how they med∣dle with the black Women, by reason of the inequality of their Constitutions.</P>
<P>The Dropsie is very frequent, which they cure by applying outwardly the Oyl of <HI>Coco</HI>-Nuts, and the Juice of several Herbs, of which the <HI>Negro's</HI> have good knowledge.</P>
<P>Above a Century of years since, the Kings of <HI>Portugal</HI> hearing of the fruit∣fulness of the Soil, sent some over thither, who died through the unwholsom∣ness of the Air: Again he sent others, who went first into <HI>Guinee,</HI> from thence to <HI>Angola,</HI> and at last setled on this Island, that they might as it were <HI>Pedetentim,</HI> step by step, be enabled to endure the evil temperature thereof.</P>
<P>Some have reported, that <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> sold the <HI>Jews</HI> for Slaves, up∣on their refusing to embrace the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and Baptizing their Chil∣dren, sent them thither; from whence the Islanders seem to be extracted.</P>
<P>No small number of sick and dead Men had the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> on this Island, when in the Year Sixteen hundred forty one, under the Command of Admiral <HI>Jol,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Houtebeen,</HI> they overcame this Island: for there scarce re∣main'd twelve sound and healthful Men in a Company; and <HI>Jol</HI> himself, with most of the other Commanders died: Nay, the Distemper came at last with such wide paces amongst them, that there scarce remain'd any to be upon the Watch, or stand Sentinells, and not Sea-men enough to Man two Ships: where∣fore they sent to Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> in <HI>Brasile</HI> for Soldiers, Provisions, and Wine for refreshment. Most of them died of great pains in their Heads; some of the Gri∣ping in the Guts in three or four days. The causes whereof might be their too
<PB N="722" REF="444"/>much eating of Black Sugar, or the Milk of <HI>Coco</HI>-Nuts, which occasions Loos∣ness; but indeed the principal cause was those malignant Fogs, against which they had no shelter. This venomous Air caus'd a greater Destruction amongst the People of the Admiral <HI>Peter Verdoes,</HI> coming thither with his Fleet in the Year Sixteen hundred and ten, in <HI>November;</HI> when within fourteen days there died above a thousand, of which the Admiral himself, and the other Admiral <HI>Storm,</HI> together with seventeen Sea-Commanders, and all the Land-Officers except one. Nay, the Disease raged at length among them with so great fury, that the Bellies of some being open'd, their Cauls were turn'd to Water.</P>
<P>The Ground is tough,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soil.</NOTE> and of a yellowish Russet Colour; and by reason of the many Mists, which fall every Night, it grows soft, like Wax, and becomes fit to produce all sorts of Grain, Fruits, and Plants. The goodness and fertility thereof appears by this; That so soon as a plain Place is left untill'd, or laid waste, Trees grow upon it, and shoot up to a great height in few days, which the <HI>Blacks</HI> cut down and burn, to plant the Sugar-Canes in their Ashes, which grow every where in the Valleys, but yield less Juyce than those in <HI>Brasile.</HI></P>
<P>The Canes Planted in the fore-mention'd Ashes, must have five Moneths time to ripen in: For that which is Planted in <HI>January,</HI> is Cut in <HI>June;</HI> and that of <HI>February,</HI> in <HI>July:</HI> And in this manner they Cut and Plant all the Year through. The full-grown Canes, when cut, are grownd small in Water-Mills, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Ingenhas;</HI> or by the Labor of Slaves or Oxen, in places where there are no Rivers: Afterwards they put the Juyce into great Kettles, and boyl it over the Fire, to cleanse it; and with the Refuse they feed the Hogs, which eating nothing else, grow exceeding fat, and are esteem'd such wholesom and sweet Flesh, that they Diet therewith the Sick, to recover them to their Health.</P>
<P>Seven Ships Lading of Sugar this Island sends forth every Year; that is, Four for <HI>Portugal,</HI> two for the <HI>Canary</HI> and <HI>Madera</HI> Islands, and one for <HI>England:</HI> And there might be a great deal more made, and also whiter; but they want Pots and other Necessaries to cleanse it, and also Refiners to work it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> have sent for many Artists from the <HI>Maderas,</HI> to make their Sugar whiter and harder; but could never effect the same, the Air making their Labor fruitless, because it doth not suffer it to dry: And therefore the Sugar-makers are necessitated to set the Loaves upon low Planks inclos'd round, and to set them upon Boughs of thick dry Wood, which being set on Fire, make no Flame nor Smoak, but at length glimmer like glowing Coals, and so dry it, as in Stoves. Before the coming of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> there grew no Sugar-canes, nor Ginger; but they brought them thither, and planted them.</P>
<P>In the Year Sixteen hundred forty five, there stood on this Island four and fifty Mills, which every one had their Moneths to grind, and could make every Year twelve or fourteen Tun of Sugar. In the Year Sixteen hundred and ten, there were sixty one Mills, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> ruin'd; so that ever since they have for the most part been able to do nothing, for want of Coppers, and Slaves to work.</P>
<P>The Corn never attains to its full growth, because the over-fatness of the Soil, and the exceeding Moisture, hinders the due Ripeness. There are many Vineyards, which have all the Year Grapes, both white and red, ripe and un∣ripe; also sweet and soure Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Pomegranates, <HI>Coco</HI>-Nuts, Figs, Water-Melons, Peaches, Olives, Almonds, and such like; but the Fruits never grow to a full perfection, because these Plants have need of a
<PB N="723" REF="444"/>closing and drying Coolness, which here they want. The want of Corn, Nature hath supply'd to the Inhabitants by Roots, as Potatoes, or <HI>Ignames,</HI> their usual and chiefest Food, of which they have four sorts; one call'd <HI>Benyn;</HI> the second, <HI>Achorere;</HI> the third, <HI>Maniconge;</HI> and the fourth <HI>Saffranee,</HI> according to the Places from whence brought to this Island. The two first are the best; the one for its sweetness, and the other for its longest keeping good. The next is <HI>Mandihoka;</HI> but they eat little of it, rather sending it to <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Brasile</HI> they plant much of it; onely the Root grows nothing near so thick there, as in these places. And here you must observe, That the Juyce must be prest out of the <HI>Brasilian Mandihoka,</HI> being so hurtful and poysonous, that if any one should chance to eat of it unpress'd, he would run the hazard of his Life: But on this Island they immediately dry it as it is Grownd, with∣out pressing, of which none get any hurt or damage by eating.</P>
<P><HI>Banano's</HI> also, <HI>Bakovens, Kussu</HI>-Apples, two or three sorts of <HI>Jojoos,</HI> or small <HI>Beews,</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI>-Wheat, or <HI>Maiz,</HI> may be had there; and <HI>Pesigos,</HI> a Fruit grow∣ing on a Tree of the same name, somewhat hairy on the out-side, which must be cut off; and then you have a little Meat, over a soft Stone, yet pleasant to the taste, and of a cooling quality.</P>
<P>Another Fruit call'd <HI>Kola,</HI> of the bigness of a Walnut, grows on very high Trees, in a light green Shell or Cod: It consists chiefly in four or five sharp red Kernels, lying close together; they taste like a raw Chessnut, but somewhat bitterish; yet a draught of Water after it, makes it seem sweet. They drive a good Trade herewith to <HI>Lovando St. Paulo,</HI> whither they carry it by Shipping.</P>
<P>Neither do they want <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees, out of which the Inhabitants make Wine, and out of the Kernel of the Fruit extract by Decoction Palm-Oyl, which they send over to <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Cotton growing there, the Inhabitants make sad and light blue co∣lour'd Clothes, like those of <HI>Benyn,</HI> but nothing neer so good; however, transported to <HI>Lovando St. Paulo,</HI> they yield sufficient profit.</P>

<P>They cannot complain of want of Cattel, having Swine, Cows, Sheep, Goats, Rams, and some small Horses. Nor of Fowl; Turkeys, Geese, Tur∣tle-Doves, Hens, Moor-Hens, Sparrows, Linnets, Paraquetoes, and several other sorts of Birds, breeding there in abundance.</P>
<P>Neither are the Sea or Rivers less kind, yielding several sorts of Fish. In short, This Island might with reason enough be term'd a happy Habitation, if the Air was but of a good temper.</P>
<P>The offensive Vermin are of three sorts: Wasps, much bigger than ours in <HI>Europe,</HI> grievously tormenting all that go into the Woods upon any occasion: Pismires, which eat up all they find, even to the grown Sugar-Canes; but they die upon the change of Weather: And Rats, great Enemies also to the Su∣gar-Plants.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are of two sorts: <HI>Portuguese,</HI> which first found this Island desolate, and inhabited the same; and <HI>Blacks,</HI> sent thither from <HI>Angola</HI> to work. Those which are born on this Island, of a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Father and Mo∣ther, though they have liv'd there a long time, are white, like the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> but the Children of a <HI>Portuguese</HI>-Man and a <HI>Black</HI>-Woman, are Brown, or Yel∣low, and therefore call'd <HI>Mulatos.</HI> There us'd every Year to be sent from

Afterwards the foremention'd Fort was surrendred by the Governor, who with eighty Garrison-Soldiers, <HI>Blacks, Whites,</HI> and <HI>Mulatos,</HI> march'd out, and with five and twenty Soldiers of the Kings Band, were Shipp'd over to <HI>Lisbon.</HI> In the Fort came to the Victors hands six and thirty great Pieces of Ordnance, of which twenty were of Brass; abundance of Powder, Match, and Bullets; but Victuals scarce for one Moneth. The City and Fort thus taken, the Ad∣miral <HI>Jol</HI> caused the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to be call'd into the City again, to Treat with him upon Equitable Concerns; whereupon two of the chiefest came and bought off the Destruction of the Mills, and preservation of their Canes, for five thousand and five hundred <HI>Crusadoes,</HI> and ten thousand <HI>Arohas</HI> of Sugar: But the Kings Revenue and Treasure came to the Victors.

Four or five of them went aboard; whereof one, whose Countenance, Breast, and Arms were white, held a green Branch, with a Clock, and a Bird, whom the Master entertain'd with Victuals, wherewith they seem'd highly pleas'd. Af∣terwards a Pot of Palm-Wine was set before them, out of which they drank to one another. At length some of the Sea-men went with them ashore, to Barter, as they had desir'd, Iron against Ivory; and coming into the Village, they saw a Hut of about three Foot high, with a Roof, but somewhat open at one side, where stood a Crock cover'd with a Net, which they would suffer no body to touch, or to see what was within. On a Stick close by stood a Childs Scull, with a Bone in the one Eye; and by that lay several other Bones, both of Fishes and Beasts, on the Ground; whence they guess'd it to be a Burying-place.

On the West side of the Church Ships have good Anchor-hold; but they must lie close under the Shore; for from the tops of the adjacent great Mountains, the Winds blow downwards with a very great force.</P>
<P>The Air seems very temperate and healthful; insomuch that sick Men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Air.</NOTE> brought ashore there, in a short time recover: Yet the Heat in the Valleys is almost intollerable, whereas the Mountains have as great an excess of Cold. It rains there commonly every day in Showres five or six times; so that want of Water causes not the Barrenness of the Soil: For besides the Rain, it hath other good and wholesom Water; particularly, in the <HI>Church-Valley,</HI> whither Sea-men come for Fresh-Water, as also to two neighboring Places. And further, not∣withstanding the general accusation of Sterility, the Ground of its own accord brings forth Pease and Beans wild, that for want of Gatherers falling make a new Increase; also whole Woods of Orange, Lemon, and Pomegranate Trees, all the year through laden both with Blossoms and Fruits; very good Figs, abundance of Ebony and Rose-Trees: Besides in the Valleys, Parsley, Mustard-seed, Purslain, Sorrel, and wild <HI>Roman</HI> Cummin-seed.</P>
<P>The Woods and Mountains are full of Goats, very large Rams, and Wild Swine, but difficult to be catch'd. When the <HI>Portuguese</HI> did first discover this Place, they found neither four-footed Beasts, nor Fruit-Trees, but onely Fresh-Water: The Fruit-Trees they brought thither afterwards, which so increas'd since, that at present all the Valleys stand full of them, to the great wonder of the Beholders, seeing the Island is seldom frequented, and not at all Inhabited. Lastly, Partridges, Pidgeons, Moor-hens, and Peacocks, breed here numerous∣ly, whereof a good Marksman with his Gun (and not otherwise) may soon provide a Dinner for his Friends. On the <HI>Cliff-Islands,</HI> at the South side of this, are thousands of grey and black <HI>Meawes,</HI> or Sea-Pies, and also white and colour'd Birds, some with long, and some with short Necks, who lay their Egs on the Rocks; and so unaccustomed to fear, that they suffer themselves to be taken up with the Hand, and gaze at their Surprizers, till knock'd on the head with Sticks.</P>
<P>From the Salt-Water beating against the Cliffs, a Froth or Scum remains in some Places, which the heat of the Sun so purifies, that it becomes white and good Salt. Some of the Mountains yield <HI>Bole Armoniack,</HI> and a fat Earth like <HI>Terra Lemnia.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea will answer the pains of a patient Fisherman, who must use an Angle, not a Net, because of the foul Ground, and beating of the Sea.

When the Sun enters into <HI>Cancer,</HI> which is in <HI>June,</HI> it Rains there continually with Storms of Thunder, Lightning, and Wind, which continues till the middle of <HI>October;</HI> which <HI>Jarrik</HI> seems to affirm, where he writes, That it doth Rain there in <HI>August, September,</HI> and <HI>October;</HI> and the Air about the middle of <HI>June</HI> gets a remarkable change, growing damp and foggy with Mists out of the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> find these Islands wild and desolate;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> but most of them now are Till'd and bare Rice, <HI>Mayz,</HI> Tares, Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, <HI>Bananoes, Ignames,</HI> Potatoes, Cucumbers, Cotton, Pomegranates, all sorts of Figs, Coco-Nuts, and Vines, which bear Fruit twice a year.</P>
<PB N="731" REF="453"/>
<P>The principal Cattel breeding here, are Goats and Sheep,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> but they have a few Oxen and Cows.</P>
<P>Fowl, and Poultry increase even to admiration; such are Hens, Crains, Tur∣tle-Doves, Turkicocks, Morehens, Quails, and Birds which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Flamingo's,</HI> that is, <HI>Flemmings,</HI> with white Feathers, red Quills, and a Body like a Goose.</P>
<P>Their greatest Wealth consists in Goat-skins and Salt,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches.</NOTE> which they send in great Parcels from the Islands <HI>Del Sall, Boavista, Mayo,</HI> and <HI>St. Lago,</HI> by Shipping into <HI>Europe.</HI> This as to the general, we will now descend to particulars.</P>
<P>The Inland of <HI>Del Sal,</HI> lies almost cover'd with Stones, but without either Plants or Trees, onely towards the South-East Point, hard by a white Sandy Bank, are seventy two Salt-Pans.</P>
<P>Many Turtels and Fish are taken between the Cliffs, out of which the Slaves decoct a Train-Oil, all out of the Salt-Water, for they have no fresh. In short, such is the sterility, as affords no other refreshment but poor Goats, yearly kill'd in great numbers for their Skins.</P>
<P>Two Miles from the Road on the South side of the Countrey, is a Pond of Salt-Water nine or ten foot deep, into which a Brook runs with very clear wa∣ter, but not held to be very wholsome, because brakish.</P>
<P><HI>St. Jago</HI> yields all sorts of Fruits, having indeed a very fruitful Soyl; Trees of Cedar, <HI>Colcoes,</HI> Oranges, and the like, all along beautifie the Banks of the Ri∣ver <HI>Ribeira Korea.</HI> They have also Rice, <HI>Maiz, Mille,</HI> Cotton, and Sugar-Canes. The <HI>European</HI> Herbs and Plants sent thither grow very well there, but must be every year renew'd. All the Wine they drink, <HI>Lisbone</HI> furnishes them with; but other Provisions they can spare to their Neighbors. The Cattel there breeding, are Oxen, Horses, Asses, and Goats, besides Hens.</P>
<P><HI>Ilha Brava,</HI> produces Figgs, Mulberries, and other Fruits; also <HI>Mille, Maiz,</HI> Water-Melons, and many others. Some Goats, but they may not be sold with∣out leave of the Governor of <HI>St. Jago.</HI></P>
<P>On the Island <HI>St. Nicholas</HI> are but few Trees. It feeds many wild Cats and Goats; close by the Shore is fresh Water in a Pond, which in time of Rain flows over the Shore into the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>St. Lucie</HI> appears Mountainous, with many Woods, and some fresh Water: At the West side, hath no other Inhabitants than Mice, and Tortoises.</P>
<P>At the Watering-place of the Island <HI>St. Vincent,</HI> fresh Water may be had out of Wells, but not very pleasant. Below on the highest Mountain, there flow∣eth a Brook, whose Waters are fresh and well tasted; all the rest sulphurous and brackish, and for that cause unfit to drink. The parch'd ground bears lit∣tle but stones, being every where so bare, that there is neither Leaves nor Grass to be found, but onely a few Shrubby Bushes, which Seamen pull up and fetch for Fuel; and <HI>Coloquintida,</HI> which grows in so great quantities, that it cannot be destroy'd. There are many Tortoises, very good in taste, and so big, that the Sea-men who touch at this Island for fresh Water, are compell'd to hale them Aboard with Ropes. They come every night in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> out of the Sea to the Land, when the Inhabitants casting them upon their backs, by reason of their weight they cannot turn themselves again. The Countrey hath many Rocks, but little Water. The Goats they kill for their Skins, which they send yearly to <HI>Portugal</HI> in great quantities. Their Inhabitants are <HI>Blacks,</HI> who live there very soberly without Recreation; fetching their Water in Leather Sacks made of Goats Skins; in the Year Sixteen hundred twenty three, they were
<PB N="732" REF="454"/>onely nineteen persons, eight Men, seven Women, and four young Girls.</P>
<P><HI>Ilha de Mayo,</HI> a Rocky and dry Land, with little Grass; affords onely some few Figg-trees, which by the heat of the Climate, and dryness of the Ground, never bear any ripe Fruit; for though the Figgs have a promising colour, yet they are insipid or tastless. But Goats, or <HI>Cabriets,</HI> or Sheep breed so nume∣rously, that above five thousand Skins are carry'd thence yearly. They have al∣so some little Horses, Asses, Oxen and Cows, Turkeys, and Hens, of the big∣ness of a Pheasant, with white and black mix'd and speckled Feathers; but all wild, and in a manner untameable.</P>
<P>There are many Salt-Pans, which after they have let in the Salt-Water, being shut up, the heat of the Sun consolidates, and brings to a Gray-Salt; but 'tis a toilsome work to gather it, and yet more troublesome to get on Ship-board, because the Boats are not without great danger of being swallow'd up by the Whirlpits.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are <HI>Whites</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> usually sent thither from <HI>St. Jago;</HI> In the Year Fifteen hundred and five, they were two hundred and five and twen∣ty, <HI>Whites</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> Old and Young, Exiles and Slaves; but in the Year Six∣teen hundred twenty and eight, there were onely fifty, besides Women.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants have neither Corn nor Clothing, unless brought them from <HI>St. Jago;</HI> but there are many Goats which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Blacks</HI> there resi∣dent catch up with Dogs, partly for the Skins, and partly for the Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>St. Anthonio</HI> has many Woods, and therein several sorts of Fruits; as Oran∣ges, Lemons, Dates, Pomegranates, Sugar-Canes, <HI>Bakovens,</HI> and Melons: One Orchard lieth in this Island, of which nothing can be seen from Sea, but a high Palm-Tree, which the people of the Ships, in the Bay of <HI>St. Vincent</HI> discern plainly, and commonly send their Boats to barter Knives, and other such small Toys for Fruit, with the people who have a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Governor; their number generally about five hundred, most of them <HI>Blacks,</HI> who from another Orchard bring the Fruits upon Asses to the Shore side, to sell to the Sea-men. In the latter end of <HI>December,</HI> they have great ripe Citrons, Lemons and Oran∣ges, many <HI>Bananoes</HI> but unripe, Potatoes and Melons, very large, and singular good.</P>

<HEAD>The Canary Islands, or Islands of the Canaries.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Canary Islands,</HI> by the consent of most eminent Geographers, are held to be the <HI>Insulae fortunatae,</HI> or <HI>Fortunate Islands</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> though <HI>Ptolomy</HI> placeth them not far enough to the North, setting the most Northerly part of them but at sixteen degrees North-Latitude, whereas they extend to the thirtieth degree; and therefore we may suppose that they mistook them for the Islands of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> last before mention'd.</P>
<P>Some will, that the <HI>Canaries</HI> receiv'd that name from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who at∣tributed to all the proper Denomination of the most Eminent, which they call'd <HI>Canary,</HI> from the many Dogs found at the first discovery thereof; <HI>Can</HI> signifying a Dog in <HI>Spanish;</HI> whereas the name of <HI>Canary</HI> was known a long time before by <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy:</HI> the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> call it <HI>Elbard,</HI> from the <HI>Pike-Mountain</HI> of <HI>Teneriff.</HI></P>

<P>These <HI>Canary Islands,</HI> whereof <HI>Lasaretto, Fuerte-Ventura, Grand Canary,</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">When found.</NOTE> in the time of <HI>Pliny, Me∣la,</HI> and <HI>Strabo;</HI> but by negligence of Posterity, the places lost as to knowledge, though Geographers had preserv'd their memory by Recording their Names, which gave the curious cause of enquiry: Some Centuries they continu'd for∣gotten, till in the Year Four hundred and five, <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Castile</HI> transferr'd all his Right therein, to a <HI>French</HI> Nobleman of <HI>Chaux</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> by name, <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Betancourt;</HI> who provided with Ammunition and Victuals, Sailing thither, at their first coming took in the Haven of <HI>Lancerota,</HI> and the Castle; and having built the Cloyster of <HI>St. Francis,</HI> together with a Church, return'd victorious to <HI>Spain;</HI> where, according to <HI>Grammay,</HI> for a Sum of Money he tranferr'd his Right to <HI>Diego de Herrera,</HI> who subdu'd the Island of <HI>Fort-aventure,</HI> to which he first gave the name of <HI>St. Bonaventure.</HI> But <HI>Sanutus</HI> writes, that <HI>Betancourt</HI> took in the Island of <HI>Lancerota</HI> and <HI>Fort-aventura,</HI> by the Consent, and at the Charge of the King of <HI>Castile,</HI> to whom he sold the Inheritance thereof after his death. <HI>Grammay</HI> affirms, That <HI>Diego de Herrera</HI> made himself Master of <HI>Ferro</HI> and <HI>Go∣mere;</HI> but not able to defend his Conquest, he sold his Interest in the whole to King <HI>Ferdinand;</HI> who after a doubtful and hot dispute with the Inhabitants, overcame the <HI>Grand Canary.</HI> Afterwards <HI>Alphonses</HI> and <HI>Bartelt de Lugo,</HI> sent thi∣ther in the Year Fifteen hundred and twelve, subjected <HI>Ferro</HI> and <HI>de Palma.

<P>If we enter into a serious scrutiny of the quantity of those Islands in general,

There are also Figgs, Oranges, Pomegranates, Citrons, Peaches, and other Fruits; besides many Sugar-Canes, Palm-Trees, and Pepper-Trees, which grow on the Banks of the Rivers.</P>
<P>There grows also a Plant, commonly call'd <HI>Oriselle,</HI> held by most Herbalists to be the <HI>Phalaris</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> and by <HI>De la Champ</HI> upon <HI>Pliny,</HI> for the <HI>Gierst</HI> of <HI>Theophrastus;</HI> from whence grows the <HI>Canary</HI> Seed, which the Inhabitants pro∣pagate diligently to feed <HI>Canary</HI> Birds.</P>
<P>They have also a black Gum or Pitch, stiled <HI>Bre,</HI> but principally in <HI>Teneriff,</HI> burn'd out of Pine in the following manner; They cut the Trees in pie∣ces, which they lay cross one upon another over a Trench, whereinto the Pitch (dissolving by the heat of the fire) falls.</P>

<PB N="737" REF="462"/>us to excessive heat, till we arrived at the Foot of the <HI>Pico,</HI> where we found many huge Stones; which seem'd to have falln from some upper part: about six in the Evening we began to ascend up the <HI>Pico;</HI> but we were scarce advanced a Mile, and the Way being no more passable for Horses, we left them with our Servants. In the ascent of one Mile some of our Company grew very faint and sick, disorder'd by Fluxes, Vomitings, and Aguish Distempers, our Horses Hair standing upright like Bristles; and calling for some of our Wine, carried in small Barrels on a Horse, we found it so wonderfully cold, that we could not drink it till we had made a Fire to warm it, notwithstand∣ing the Air was very calm and moderate: but when the Sun was set, it began to blow with such violence, and grow so cold, that taking up our Lodging among the hollow Rocks, we were necessitated to keep great Fires in the Mouthes of them all night. About four in the morning we began to Mount again, and being come another Mile up, one of our Company fail'd, and was able to proceed no farther: Here began the <HI>Black Rocks.</HI> The rest of us pursu'd our Journey till we came to the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> where we began to travel again in a white Sand, being fitted with Shooes, whose single Soles are made a Finger broader than the upper Leather, to encounter this difficult Passage; having ascended as far as the <HI>Black Rocks,</HI> which lay all flat like a plain Floor, we climb'd within a Mile of the very top of the <HI>Pico,</HI> and at last we gain'd the Summit; where we found no such Smoak as appear'd a little below, but a continuall perspiration of a hot and sulphurous Vapor, that made our Faces extreamly sore. All this way we found no considerable alteration of the Air, and very little Wind; but on the top it was so impetuous, that we had much ado to stand against it whilst we drank the Kings Health, and fir'd each of us a Piece. Here also we took our Dinner, but found that our Strong-waters had lost their Vertue, and were almost insipid, while our Wine was more spiritous and brisk than before. The top, on which we stood, being not above a Yard broad, is the brink of a Pit, call'd <HI>The Caldera,</HI> which we judg'd to be a Mus∣quet-shot over, and near fourscore Yards deep, in form of a <HI>Cone,</HI> hollow with∣in like a Kettle, and cover'd over with small loose Stones, mixed with Sulphure and Sand, from among which issu'd divers Spiracles of Smoak and Heat, which being stirr'd with any thing, puffs and makes a noise, and so offensive, that we were almost suffocated with the sudden emanation of Vapors upon the remo∣ving one of these Stones, which were so hot, as not easily to be handled. We de∣scended not above four or five Yards into the <HI>Caldera,</HI> because of the slipperiness under foot, and the difficulty; but some have adventur'd to the bottom. Other matters observable we discover'd none, besides a clear sort of Sulphure, which lay like Salt upon the Stones. From this renown'd <HI>Pico</HI> we could see the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> fourteen Leagues distant; <HI>Palma,</HI> eighteen; and <HI>Gomera,</HI> seven; which interval of Sea seem'd not much wider than the <HI>Thames</HI> about <HI>London.</HI> We discerned also the <HI>Herro,</HI> being distant about twenty Leagues, and so to the outmost Limits of the Sea much farther. As soon as the Sun appeared, the Shadow of the <HI>Pico</HI> seem'd to cover, not onely the whole Island, and the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> but the Sea to the very Horizon, where the top of the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> or <HI>Pico,</HI> visibly appear'd to turn up, and cast its Shade into the Air it self, at which we were much surpriz'd: But the Sun was not far ascended, when the Clouds began to rise so fast, as that they intercepted our Prospect both of the Sea and the whole Island, except the tops onely of the subjacent Mountains, which seem'd to pierce them through. Whether these Clouds do very sur∣mount
<PB N="738" REF="463"/>the <HI>Pico,</HI> we cannot say, but to such as are far below, they seem sometimes to hang above it, or rather wrap themselves about it, as constantly when the West-winds blow; this they call <HI>The Cap,</HI> and is an infallible Prognostick of en∣suing Storms. One of our Company who made this Journey again two years after, arriving at the top of the <HI>Pico</HI> before day, and creeping under a great Stone to shroud himself from the cold Air, after a little space found himself all wet, and perceiv'd it to come from a perpetual trickling of Water from the Rocks above him. Many excellent and exuberant Springs we found issuing from the tops of most of the other Mountains, gushing out in great spouts, al∣most as far as the huge Pine-Tree, which we mention'd before. Having staid a while at the top, we all descended the sandy Way, till we came to the Foot of the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> which being steep, even almost to a perpendicular, we soon passed: And here we met with a Cave, about ten yards deep, and fifteen broad, being in shape like an Oven, or <HI>Cupola,</HI> having a hole at the top near eight Yards over: This we descended by a Rope that our Servants held fast at the top, while with the other end, being fastned about our middles, we swung our selves, till being over a Bank of Snow, we slid down, lighting upon it: we were forced to swing thus in the descent, because in the midst of the bot∣tom of this Cave, opposite to the overture at the top, is a round Pit of Water, like a Well; the surface whereof is about a Yard lower, but as wide as the Mouth at top, and about six Fathom deep: We supposed this Water not a Spring, but dissoved Snow blown in, or Water trickling through the Rocks. About the sides of the Grot, for some heighth there is Ice and Isicles hanging down to the Snow: But being quickly weary of this excessive cold place, and drawn up again, we continu'd our descent from the Mountains by the same Passage we went up the day before, and so about five in the Evening arrived at <HI>Oratava,</HI> from whence we set forth; our Faces so red and sore, that to cool them we were forced to wash and bathe them in Whites of Eggs. The whole heighth of the <HI>Pico</HI> in perpendicular, is vulgarly esteem'd to be two Miles and a half. No Trees, Herbs, nor Shrubs, did we find in all the Passage, but Pines; and among the whiter Sands a kind of Broom, being a bushy Plant; and on that side where we lay all night, a kind of <HI>Coalon,</HI> which had Stems of eight Foot high, and the Trunk near a Foot thick, every Stem growing in four squares, and emerging from the Ground like Tufts of Rushes: Upon the edges of these Stems grow very small red Buttons, or Berries, which being squeezed, produce a poysonous Milk; which falling upon any part of a Horse, or other Beast, fetches off all the Hair from the Skin immediately. Of the wi∣ther'd Sticks of this Vegetable we made our Fire all night. This Plant is also universally spread over the Island, and is perhaps a kind of <HI>Euphorbium.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Island <HI>Teneriff</HI> it self, this account was given by a judicious and inge∣nious Man, who lived twenty years in it, as a Physitian and Merchant; his opinion is, That the whole Island being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brimstone, did in former times take Fire, and blow up all, or near all at the same time; and that many Mountains of huge Stones calcin'd and burnt, which appears all over this Island, especially in the South-west part of it, were cast up, and raised out of the bowels of the Earth at the time of that general Conflagration; and that the greatest quantity of this Sulphur lying about the Center of the Island, raised up the <HI>Pico</HI> to that heighth at which it is now seen. And he saith, That any one upon the Place, that shall carefully note the situa∣tion and manner of those calcined Rocks, how they lie, will easily be of that
<PB N="739" REF="463"/>mind; for they lie (says he) three or four Miles almost round the bottom of the <HI>Pico,</HI> and in such order one above another almost to the <HI>Sugar-Loaf,</HI> as 'tis call'd, as if the whole Ground swelling and rising up together by the ascension of the Brimstone, the Torrents and Rivers of it, did with a sudden eruption rowl and rumble them down from the rest of the Rocks, especially (as is said before) to the South-west; for on that side from the very top of the <HI>Pico</HI> almost to the Sea-coast, lie huge heaps of these burnt Rocks one under another: and there still remain the very tracks of the Brimstone-Rivers, as they ran over this quarter of the Island, which hath so wasted the Ground beyond recovery, that nothing can be made to grow there but Broom: But on the North-side of the <HI>Pico,</HI> few or none of these Stones appear; and hence he concludes, That the <HI>Vulcanio</HI> discharged it self chiefly on the South-west-side. He adds farther, That at the same time, Mynes of several Metals were blown up, some of those cal∣cined Rocks resembling Iron, Oar, some Silver, and others Copper; particu∣larly on the South-west part, call'd <HI>Azuleios,</HI> being very high Mountains, where never any <HI>English</HI>-man but himself (that ever he heard of) was. There are vast quantities of a loose blewish Earth, mixed with blew Stones, which have a yellow rust upon them, like that of Copper or Vitriol; as also many small Springs of Vitriol-water, where he supposes a Copper Myne. And he was told by a Bell-Founder of <HI>Oratava,</HI> That he got out of two Horse-loads of this Earth, as much Gold as made two large Rings. And a <HI>Portuguese</HI> who had been in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> told him, That his opinion was, there were as good Mynes of Gold and Silver there, as the best in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> Thereabouts also are Nitrous-waters and Stones, cover'd over with a deep Saffron-colour'd rust, tasting of Iron. And farther, he mentions one of his Friends, which of two Lumps of Earth, or Oar, brought from the top of this side of the Mountain, made two Silver Spoons. All this he confirmed by the last Instance of the <HI>Palm-Island,</HI> eighteen Leagues from <HI>Teneriff,</HI> where, about twelve years since, so <HI>Vulcanio</HI> was fixed, the violence whereof made an Earthquake in this Island, so great, that he and others ran out of their Houses, fearing they would have fall'n upon their Heads. They heard the noise of the Torrent of flaming Brimstone like Thunder, and saw the Fire as plain by night for six weeks toge∣ther, as a burning Torch, and so much Sand and Ashes, brought from thence by the Wind and Clouds, fell upon his Hat, as would fill the Sand-box of his Ink∣horn.</P>
<P>In some places of this Island groweth a crooked Shrub call'd <HI>Legnan,</HI> which they bring for <HI>England</HI> as a sweet Wood. There are likewise Apricock, Peach-Trees, and others, which bear twice a year; also Pear-Trees as preg∣nant; Almonds, with a tender Shell; Palms, Plantains, Oranges and Lemons, especially the <HI>Paeguada's,</HI> which have small ones within them, from whence they are so denominated. Also they have Sugar-Canes, and a little Cotton, <HI>Coloquintida,</HI> &amp;c. The Roses blow at <HI>Christmas.</HI> There are good Carnations, and very large; but no Tulips will grow or thrive there. Samphire clothes the Rocks in abundance, and a kind of Clover, the Ground. Another Grass grows near the Sea, which is of a broader Leaf, so luscious and rank, that it will kill a Horse that eats of it, but no other Beast. Eighty Ears of Wheat have been found to spring from one Root, but grows not very high. The Corn of this is transparent like the purest yellow Amber, and one Bushel hath brought forth a hundred in a seasonable Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canary</HI>-Birds which they bring to us in <HI>England,</HI> breed in the <HI>Baranco's,</HI>
<PB N="740" REF="464"/>or <HI>Gills,</HI> which the Water hath fretted away in the Mountains, being places very cold. There are also Quails, Partridges, larger than ours, and exceed∣ing beautiful, great Wood-Pigeons; Turtles at Spring, Crows, and sometimes the Falcons come flying over from the Coast of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>Bees are carry'd into the Mountains, where they prosper exceedingly. And there they have wild Goats, which climb to the very top of the <HI>Pico</HI> sometimes; also Hogs, and multitudes of Coneys.</P>
<P>Of Fish they have the <HI>Cherna,</HI> a very large and excellent Fish, better ta∣sted than any we have in <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Mero,</HI> Dolphins, Lobsters, without great Claws, Mussles, Periwincles, and the <HI>Clacas,</HI> which is absolutely the very best Shell-fish in the world; they grow in the Rocks, five or six under one great Shell, through the top-holes whereof they peep out with their Nebs; from whence (the Shells being broken open a little more with a Stone) they draw them. There is also another sort of Fish like an Eel, which hath six or seven Tails of a Span long, united to one Head and Body, which is also as short. Besides, there they have Turtles and <HI>Cabrido's,</HI> which are better than our Trouts.</P>
<P>The Island is full of Springs of fresh Water, tasting like Milk; which in <HI>Lalagima,</HI> where the Water is not so clear and lympid, they cleanse by percola∣ting it through a kind of spungy Stone, cut in form of a Bason.</P>
<P>The Vines which afford those excellent Wines, grow all about the Island within a Mile of the Sea; such as are planted farther up are not esteem'd, nor will they thrive in any of the other Islands. Concerning the <HI>Guanchio's,</HI> or an∣tient Inhabitants, he gave this full account:</P>
<P>The third of <HI>September,</HI> about twelve years since, he took his Journey from <HI>Guimar,</HI> a Town for the most part inhabited by such as derive themselves from the antient <HI>Guanchio's,</HI> in the Company of some of them, to view their Caves, and the Corps buried in them, (a favour they seldom or never permit to any, having the Corps of their Ancestors in great veneration, and likewise being extremely against any molestation of the Dead) but he had done several Elee∣mosinary Cures among them, for they are very poor (yet the poorest think themselves too good to Marry with the best <HI>Spaniard</HI>) which endeared him to them exceedingly, otherwise it is death for any Stranger to visit these Caves and Bodies. The Corps are sew'd up in Goat-skins with Thongs of the same, with very great curiosity, particularly in the incomparable exactness and even∣ness of the Seams; and the Skins are made very close and fit to the Corps; which for the most part are entire, the Eyes clos'd, Hair on their Heads, Ears, Nose, Teeth, Lips and Beard, all perfect, onely discolour'd, and a little shri∣vell'd; likewise the <HI>Pudenda</HI> of both Sexes. He saw about three or four hundred in several Caves, some of them standing, others lying upon Beds of Wood, so hardned by an Art they had (which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Curay,</HI> to cure a piece of Wood,) that no Iron can pierce or hurt it. These Bodies are very light, as if made of Straw; and in some broken Bodies be observ'd the Nerves and Ten∣dons, and also the String of the Veins and Arteries very distinctly. By the relation of the most antient of this Island, they had a particular Tribe that had this Art onely among themselves, and kept it as a thing sacred, and not to be communicated to the Vulgar. These mixt not themselves with the rest of the Inhabitants, nor Marry'd out of their own Tribe, and were also their Priests and Ministers of Religion. But when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> conquer'd the Place, most of them were destroy'd, and the Art perisht with them; onely they held some Tra∣ditions,
<PB N="741" REF="464"/>yet of a few Ingredients that were us'd in this business; they took But∣ter (some say they mixed Bears-grease with it) which they kept for that pur∣pose in the Skins; wherein they boyl'd certain Herbs, first a kind of wild La∣vender, which grows there in great quantities upon the Rocks; secondly, an Herb call'd <HI>Lara,</HI> of a very gummy and glutinous consistence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains; thirdly, a kind of <HI>Cyclamen,</HI> or Sow-bread; fourthly, wild Sage, which grows plentifully upon this Island. These with others, bruised, and boyl'd up with Butter, rendred it a perfect Bal∣som. This prepar'd, they first unbowel the Corps (and in the poorer sort, to save Charges, took out the Brain behind:) after the Body was thus order'd, they had in readiness a <HI>Lixivium</HI> made of the Bark of Pine-Trees, wherewith they washt the Body, drying it in the Sun in Summer, and in the Winter in a Stove, this repeating very often: Afterward they began their Unction both without and within, drying it as before; this they continu'd till the Balsom had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muscle, in all parts appear'd through the contracted Skin, and the Body became exceeding light: then they sew'd them up in the Goat-skins, as was mention'd before.</P>
<P>The Antients say, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Personages, with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themselves, and which they will never discover.</P>
<P>Lastly he says, That Bodies are found in the Caves of the <HI>Grand Canaries,</HI> in Sacks, quite consumed, and not as these in <HI>Teneriff.</HI></P>
<P>Antiently, when they had no knowledge of Iron, they made their Lances of Wood, hardned as before mention'd.</P>
<P>They have Earthen Pots, so hard that they cannot be broken: Of these some are found in the Caves, and old <HI>Bavances,</HI> and us'd by the poorer People that find them, to boyl Meat in.</P>
<P>Their Food is Barley Parched, and then Ground with little Stone-Mills, and mingled with Milk and Honey, which they always carry with them in Goat-skins at their Backs.</P>
<P>To this day they drink no Wine, nor care for Flesh: they are very ingeni∣ous, lean, tall, active, and full of courage; for they will leap from Rock to Rock, from a very prodigious heighth till they come to the bottom, sometimes making ten Fathom deep at one Leap, in this manner: First they <HI>Tertiate</HI> their Lances, which are about the bigness of a Half-Pike, and aim with the Point at any piece of a Rock upon which they intend to light, sometimes not half a Foot broad; in leaping off they clap their Feet close to the Lance, and so carry their Bodies in the Air: the Point of the Lance comes first to the place, which breaks the force of their fall; then they slide gently down by the Staff, and pitch with their Feet on the very place they first design'd, and so from Rock to Rock, till they come to the bottom: But their Novices sometimes break their Necks in the learning.</P>
<P>He told also (and the same was seriously confirm'd by a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and ano∣ther <HI>Canary</HI> Merchant there in the Company,) That they Whistle so loud, as to be heard five Miles off, and that to be in the same Room with them when they Whistle, were enough to endanger the breaking of the <HI>Tympanum</HI> of the Ear; and added, That he (being in Company of one that Whistled his loudest) could not hear perfectly in fifteen days after. He affirms also, that they throw Stones with a force almost as great as that of a Bullet; and now use Stones in all their Fights, as they did antiently. Thus far Mr. <HI>Sprat.</HI></P>

<P>When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at the Conquest hereof found no Springs, Wells, nor Rivers of fresh Water, they stood amazed, and asked the Inhabitants whence they gat their Water? they answer'd, That they preserv'd the Rain-water in Vessels; for the Tree they had cover'd with Canes, Earth, and other things, in hope by this means to cause the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to leave the Island: But this sub∣tilty did them little good; for a Woman had discover'd the Secret to a <HI>Spaniard</HI> that was her Gallant, who disclos'd it again to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Commanders. In brief, this Tree affords so much Water, that it not onely furnisheth the Inha∣bitants and their Cattel, but also Ships which by accident come thither.</P>
<P>This Tree, which the Inhabitants call <HI>Garoe,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards, Santo,</HI> that is, <HI>Holy,</HI> attains a competent bigness, having always green Leaves like the Lawrel, but not much bigger than those of a Nut-Tree, and a Fruit like an Acorn in the Shell, with a very sweet and Spicy Kernel; and for defence and presenva∣tion they have enclos'd it with a Stone-Wall.</P>

By this means the <HI>Portuguese</HI> gain'd it, but under∣went many hazards therein before they could make any advantage from it, in regard the Fire raged so furiously, as that it forced them for a time to forsake the Place. The burning continu'd seven years among the thick Trees; but at length the Fuel failing, the Fire extinguish'd of it self; whereon immediately planting and manuring it, 'tis become at this day one of the best and delight∣fullest Places that can be found.</P>

<P>The Air keeps so even a temperature, that neither Heat or Cold invade it with excess: the Ground enriched by many excellent Springs of fresh Water; and besides fertilitated with the advantage of seven or eight small Rivers; so that every part lies carpetted with a pleasant Verdure, or beautifi'd with the delightful prospect of various Fruits, always flourishing on their natural Stems, and gather'd, as well please the Palate, as the Trees refresh the Body by their cooling shade: But especially it affords an excellent Wine, better in the second and third year than in the first.</P>

<P>It lieth in six and forty Degrees of Longitude, and in five and thirty and ten Minutes North-Latitude, or according to <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> in four and thirty De∣grees forty Minutes, and hath in length, from East to West six Leagues, in breadth three, and in compass fifteen.</P>
<P>It hath on the East, the <HI>Mediterranean Sea;</HI> on that side next <HI>Candia,</HI> in the North, the Island of <HI>Sicily,</HI> not above fifteen Leagues distant; in the South, <HI>Tri∣polis,</HI> in <HI>Barbary</HI> and the lesser <HI>Africa;</HI> in the West, the Islands of <HI>Pantalaree, Linose,</HI> and <HI>Lampadouse.</HI> The Sea which divides it from <HI>Sicily</HI> bears the Name of <HI>The Channel of Malta. Ptolomy</HI> places there a City of the same Name, and two Tem∣ples, one of <HI>Juno,</HI> and the other of <HI>Hercules.</HI></P>
<P>At this day it contains four Wall'd Cities, besides a great number of Towns; the Cities are, <HI>Valette, Citta Vecchia,</HI> that is, <HI>The Old City,</HI> otherwise <HI>Old Malta, Biurgo Sante Angelo,</HI> or <HI>The City of Angels,</HI> otherwise <HI>Citta Victoriosa,</HI> and the City or Town of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> or <HI>Sangde.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Valette,</HI> by the <HI>Italians</HI> call'd <HI>Terra Nuova,</HI> and by the <HI>French, Ville Neuve,</HI> gain'd that Name from the Grand Master <HI>Jan de Valette,</HI> otherwise <HI>Parisot,</HI> who pre∣sently built it after the Siege of the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred sixty five, who had then straitned this Island, and taken the Castle <HI>St. Elmo,</HI> lying before the City.</P>
<PB N="746" REF="469"/>
<P>The City stands founded upon a Rock, and an elevated piece of Ground, call'd <HI>Scebarras,</HI> which severs the Haven <HI>Marza Mazetta,</HI> and the <HI>Great Haven,</HI> being indeed an <HI>Isthmus,</HI> the Sea beating on three sides of it; and a great Trench hewn out of the Rock, cuts it off from the rest of the Island. On the outmost Point of that Rock, before it, stands the Castle <HI>St. Elmo.</HI></P>
<P>It appears very strong, surrounded on the out side with Ditches cut in the Rocks, fortified with Bulwarks, and very delightful Out-works; within beautified with straight and broad Streets, of which the chiefest are <HI>Strata Reale,</HI> or <HI>The High Street;</HI> and <HI>Strata Merchanti, The Merchants Street.</HI> The Houses lofty, built of hewn Stone, with flat Roofs, according to the manner of the Eastern Countreys, to the number of about two thousand. Every House had former∣ly a Cistern to catch Rain-water; but Strangers at this day fetch it from some fair Springs, neighboring the <HI>Port del Monto,</HI> on the Sea-coast, whither the Wa∣ter hath been brought some Miles out of the Countrey by Conduits; an In∣vention of the Grand Master <HI>Alofi Vignacourt,</HI> to the great Relief and Comfort as well of the Inhabitants as Foreigners, which lie with their Ships before the City: for the Water spouts by the opening of an Engine in the City, and by Pipes runs into the Cask in the Boats.</P>
<P>Three Gates give entrance into it; one at the Haven call'd <HI>Porta del Monte,</HI> and two at the Land-side, <HI>viz. Porta Reale,</HI> and <HI>Porta Boucheria,</HI> or <HI>The Slaughter∣house Gate.</HI></P>
<P>There are seven Churches; the chiefest is that of <HI>St. John,</HI> the Patron or Guardian-Protector of the Order of the Knights of <HI>Malta;</HI> on the right side whereof, stands the Figure of that Saint, in a lively Representation. The other are, <HI>St. Augustine, St. Dominico, St. Maria Jesus, St. Paulo, Madona de Carmine, Collegio de Jesu, La Madama de la Victoria.</HI></P>
<P>There are also seven Palaces or Courts, call'd <HI>Auberge,</HI> or <HI>Bergia,</HI> for the seven Languages; for into so many Nations of several Tongues, are the Knights divided; in every one of which the Superiors have their Residence, and live upon the Expence of the Order: As <HI>Bergia</HI> or <HI>Auberge, di Provence; Bergia de Auvergne</HI> or <HI>Alvenia, Bergia de France, Bergia di Italia, Bergia di Arragon, Bergia de Alemagna, Bergia di Castilia;</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Palace or Court of Provence, The Palace of Auvergne, The Palace of France, The Palace of Italy, The Palace of Arragon, Germany, and Spain.</HI> Formerly there was a <HI>Bergia di Angliterre,</HI> but at this day annihilated.</P>
<P>There are several Cloysters; as, of <HI>St. Ursula, St. Catherine,</HI> and <HI>di Repenti.</HI> The Palace of the Grand-Master (for here he holds his Court) stands between <HI>St. Elmo</HI> and <HI>St. Johns,</HI> wherein is a great Hall, the usual Place for the meeting of the Grand-Master, with the Counsellors, or Knights of the Great Cross.</P>
<P>In the Court behind the Palace, stand fix'd in the Wall the Portraictures of two very ancient Marble Heads, rais'd upon an Arch, bigger than the Life; one with this Inscription, <HI>Zenobia Orientalis Domina;</HI> and the other; <HI>Petesilia.</HI> They were found in <HI>Malta,</HI> in the Year Two hundred seventy six.</P>
<P>They have a Market-place, to which the Countrey People bring all sorts of Fruit, Fowl, Sheep, Goats, Hogs, and other provision, to sell.</P>
<P>Near the Castle of <HI>St. Elmo</HI> you may see an Hospital,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The House of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick.</NOTE> being the House of Entertainment for the Sick; a stately Building, especially since the Enlarge∣ment in the year Sixteen hundred sixty four; wherein every Sick Person hath a Chamber, in a great Hall, thirty Paces long, and ten broad, standing near one to another, on each side five and twenty. The Sick are serv'd in good or∣der,

<P>There is an Arsenal, or Magazine of Arms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magazine of Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> under the Inspection of a Ca∣valier, or Knight; wherein they have a very large and stately Hall, compleat∣ly furnish'd with all sorts of Warlike Weapons. In the middle stand five square Wooden Buildings, whose in-sides are adorn'd in very good Order with all sorts of Defensive Arms, as Cuirasses, Coats of Mail, Caskets, Head-pieces, Shields, Back-swords, Halberds, Pikes, Half-Lances, Muskets, Dags, Ponyards, Pistols, Snap-hances, and such like. Above hang many Bowes, and other Wea∣pons, us'd of old by the Knights of <HI>Rhodes.</HI> In brief, there are sufficient of all sorts to equip six and thirty thousand Men. There are three or four compleat Suits of Armor, <HI>Cap-a-pe;</HI> the middlemost being that which the Grand Master <HI>De la Valette,</HI> in the Siege in the year Sixteen hundred sixty five, us'd. There is also a Piece of Cannon upon the Carriage, made of Leather; but with so great Art and Curiosity, that it seems verily an Iron Piece. All these Arms are kept very clean and bright, by Officers to that onely purpose appointed. Every Knight, notwithstanding all this Provision, hath his Arms by himself, in his own House; as have also the Citizens, and Countrey People. The <HI>Banjert</HI> is a large House or Prison, wherein many Slaves of all Nations are bought and sold.</P>
<P>They have a Custom-house, Treasury, Chancery, and Magazine for Wine and Corn; a Castle for the Courts of Justice, Princely Stables for Horses, and a separate Field, with all Conveniences, for the Founding of Great Ordnance.</P>
<P>The Castle of <HI>St. Elmo,</HI> built upon a Rock, on the Out-point of <HI>Valette</HI> to∣wards the Sea, is as it were encompass'd with several fair and large Havens; three on the right side, and five on the left; all guarded by the Castle of <HI>St. An∣gelo,</HI> built on the Point of <HI>Burgo,</HI> or <HI>Citta Vittorioso.</HI> Between this Castle and <HI>Va∣lette</HI> are Corn-pits hewn in the Rocks.</P>
<P>In the great Haven over against <HI>Valette,</HI> are two long slips of Land,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>St. Angelo.</HI></NOTE> with their Points; in one whereof, seated upon a Rock, lieth the Castle <HI>St. Angelo;</HI> and besides it, nothing remarkable, but an old small Church, built first by the Clergy of this Order, wherein you may see the Tomb of the Grand-Master <HI>Philip de Villiers d' Isle Dam,</HI> who there with the Order, after the loss of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> in the year Fifteen hundred and thirty, the six and twentieth of <HI>October,</HI> took his first Residence, after eight Years Adventures. It was formerly strengthen'd with many Bulwarks and Walls; provided with Wells of Water, a Magazine of Arms, together with a Palace for the Knights: but since the Siege of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred fifty five, greatly decay'd. Here stands al∣so an Hospital for sick and poor Diseased Mariners, who are serv'd by the Ju∣nior Knights, with Silver Vessels, in good order. Lastly, A Yard or Dock for the Building of Galleys, with <HI>Barrakes</HI> or Store-houses adjoyning; neighbor'd by the stately Mansion of the General of the Galleys.</P>
<P>Beyond this, upon the same Rock, stands <HI>Citta Vittorioso,</HI> so call'd because of the foremention'd Siege which it endur'd from the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>It was built by the Grand Master <HI>Philip de Villiers d' Isle Dam,</HI> when the Knights had first the Possession of this Island given them; and at this day con∣veniently Fortified. It contains in Circuit half a Mile, wherein about twelve hundred Houses, and these following Churches, <HI>viz. St. Andria, Maria della
<PB N="748" REF="472"/>Carne, St. Spirito Santo, St. Laurenzo;</HI> by the Market <HI>La Muneiata, St. Scholastique,</HI> a Cloyster of Nuns, and <HI>Grecian</HI> Church. The Inquisitor hath there also a Palace for his Residence.</P>
<P>On the other Slip of Land,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>St. Michael.</HI></NOTE> more inwards, lieth the City call'd <HI>La Isula,</HI> at the East end whereof stands <HI>St. Michaels Fort,</HI> parted only from the main Land by a deep Trench; the whole erected about the year Fifteen hundred and six, by the Grand Master <HI>Claudius de la Sangle,</HI> and now strongly Fortified accord∣ing to the Modern way. It hath in compass about a small Mile, and chiefly in∣habited by Mariners, who continually keep Vessels abroad against the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Burgo</HI> and <HI>La Isula</HI> lies a Haven, wherein all the Capers and Galleys of <HI>Malta</HI> harbor, with their Prizes, as well <HI>Turks</HI> as <HI>Christians:</HI> The Entrance, at the coming of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet, was chain'd up. In <HI>La Isula</HI> are four Churches; <HI>Maria Porto Salvo, Madama de Victoria, St. Philippo Nere,</HI> and <HI>St. Julian.</HI> At the end of the Haven, beyond the City, on the East side, lieth <HI>Burmola,</HI> as being with∣out the City, inhabited by Strangers; together with two Havens, one call'd <HI>La Marza,</HI> and the other <HI>La Marza Picciola,</HI> that is, <HI>The Small Haven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Citta Vecchia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Malta.</NOTE> or <HI>The Old City,</HI> which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call'd by the Name of the Island <HI>Melite;</HI> and others, <HI>Old Malta,</HI> is said to have been built by the <HI>Carthaginians;</HI> but the Inhabitants know it by the Name of <HI>Medina,</HI> deriv'd from the <HI>Arabick</HI> Language, in memory of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who so call'd it, from a City of the same denomination in <HI>Arabia,</HI> the Sepulchre of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The principal Church is that of <HI>St. Peters,</HI> being the first which the <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> built in this Island, after the Preaching of the Apostle <HI>St. Paul.</HI> Without the City stands another, dedicated to <HI>St. Agatha,</HI> where, upon the Altar, sits a white Marble Image of <HI>St. Agatha</HI> Preaching. Under this Church is a Grot, with two or three Entrances; yet few People venture into it, because of the several strange Meanders, and dismal narrowness of the place; and therefore one of these Entrances, being more dangerous than the rest, was closed up by Command. They go in by a Rope, made fast above, by which they slide down, carrying with them burning Torches.</P>
<P>Towns,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns.</NOTE> in <HI>Italian</HI> call'd <HI>Casals,</HI> and by the Inhabitants, in <HI>Arabick, Adhamet; Jerome</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in his Siege of <HI>Malta,</HI> computed to be about five and forty; <HI>Bosio,</HI> to forty; others, scarce to six and thirty: but the Knights themselves, according to <HI>Davity,</HI> reckon them sixty.</P>

<P>Two or three Miles Northward of <HI>Valetta,</HI> appeareth <HI>Nasciaro,</HI> grac'd with a very fine Church, to which adjoyns a Garden of Pleasure, call'd by the name of the Grand Master, <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> being very large, and divided into several Quarters, all full of Vines, Oranges, Lemons, Pomegranates, Citrons, Olives, and other Fruit-Trees; together with a handsom Palace, having many Rooms
<PB N="749" REF="472"/>of Entertainment, besides private Recesses, and particular Apartments: This, in regard of its distance, is not so much frequented, as that of <HI>San Gioseppo,</HI> be∣ing nearer, whither the Grand Masters and the whole Court often retire for Recreation.</P>
<P>On the South-Coast, and that side towards <HI>Tripolis,</HI> this Island hath nothing but great Cliffs and Rocks; but on the other side, several Capes, convenient for small Boats. First, passing to the East, you come to the Haven of <HI>Marza Scola (Marza</HI> signifies <HI>A Haven</HI>) and a small Mile from thence, to the South-West of <HI>Sirok,</HI> to <HI>Marza Sirokko,</HI> that is, <HI>The South-West Port,</HI> being very large and capacious. From thence turning to the South, you may see <HI>Golpho de Pietra Santa,</HI> or <HI>Holy Stone Gulph,</HI> opposite to the small Island <HI>Fursula,</HI> or <HI>Forrola.</HI></P>
<P>But to the Westward appear two great Roads; one call'd <HI>Antfega,</HI> but ac∣cording to the <HI>Maltesian</HI> Orthography, <HI>Hayntoffeka;</HI> and the other, <HI>Porto del Mugaro.</HI> Passing thence Westwards, you arrive at <HI>Meleca,</HI> a good Landing-place, over against which the Island <HI>Goze</HI> shews it self, sever'd from <HI>Malta</HI> by a narrow Channel, intituled <HI>Feo.</HI></P>
<P>The Eastern Coast brings you to <HI>Porto delle Saline Vecchie, The Haven of the Old Salt-Pit.</HI></P>
<P>Right out from thence, over against <HI>Sicily,</HI> you come to <HI>Cala di Sante Paulo, The Cape of St. Paul,</HI> and by that a Bay; so call'd, because the Inhabitants be∣lieve, That the Ship wherein the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was brought over Captive, by Storm was cast away, and Shipwrack'd against this Place; though some (with what Reason we will not determine) imagine that Shipwrack to have been suffer'd not here, but upon the Island <HI>Melite</HI> by <HI>Ragousa.</HI></P>
<P>This Bay sends an Arm well near two <HI>Italian</HI> Miles up into the Countrey; but neither broad, nor deep. The adjacent Shore being full of Rocks, scarce∣ly appearing above the Surface of the Water, confirms the Arguments of <HI>St. Paul's</HI> Shipwrack here. In the place where the Viper leap'd out of the Fire to the hand of the Apostle, the first converted <HI>Christians</HI> erected a small Chappel, being since decay'd by Wind and Weather; but of late renew'd again: So that now there stands a handsom little Church, rebuilt in the Year Sixteen hundred and sixteen, by the Grand Master <HI>Alophi Tignacourt.</HI> Above the Altar in the Church are to be seen divers Images decyphering the Miracle done by the Apostle, in flinging off the Viper from his Hand, himself kneeling; with ma∣ny Figures of Men and Women, bigger than the Life, round about, in Old <HI>Maltesia</HI> Garments, cut out with excellent Postures, to admiration. Above this Altar-piece, stands this Inscription in <HI>Latin:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Vipera, Ignis acta Calore, frustra Pauli manum invadit: is Insulae benedicens</HI></L>
<L><HI>Anguibus &amp; Herbis adimit omne virus.</HI></L>
<L>M. DC. V.</L>
<L>(That is)</L>
<L><HI>The Viper, constrain'd by the Heat of the Fire, leap'd in vain upon the Hand of</HI> Paul:</L>
<L><HI>He blessing the Island, took away all Poyson from the Serpents and Plants.</HI></L>
<L>1605.</L></Q></P>
<P>Close by the Sea is a Rock, with a small Pit, out of which very sweet and rellishing Water issues, which they say came miraculously, by the Apostles
<PB N="750" REF="473"/>striking the Rock, for want of Water to quench his thirst. A little more Sou∣therly lies a Salt-pit, call'd <HI>Saline Nova;</HI> and close by it, under the Shore, the Island <HI>Gallis.</HI> Towards the South you have <HI>Cala di Marco,</HI> and <HI>Cala di St. George:</HI> And lastly, <HI>Punta di Dragut,</HI> over against <HI>Valetta,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>St. Elmo.</HI> There are moreover two Havens; one stil'd <HI>Marza di Musseto,</HI> and the other call'd <HI>Mar∣za,</HI> or <HI>Il Porto Grande, The Great Haven,</HI> between <HI>Valetta</HI> and <HI>Fort St. Angelo;</HI> whose Entrance, call'd <HI>Bocca el Porto,</HI> is defended on the one side by a Redoubt rais'd upon the Point; and on the other side, by the Great Guns of the Bulwark of <HI>Valetta.</HI></P>
<P>South-Westwards from <HI>Old Malta,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Garden <HI>Boschetto.</HI></NOTE> the Grand Master hath his fairest Garden of Pleasure, call'd <HI>Boschetto,</HI> seated on the top of a high Rock, not without great Charge, all the Earth being carried up to it; and planted with Orange, Lemon, Citron, Pomegranate, Olive, and other Trees; together with several rare and unusual Plants: Near which he hath a Park of Deer, a Warren of Hares, Coneys, and a Wood of Olive-Trees, wherein breed Stags and Hinds; besides several excellent natural Springs, and rare artificial Water-works; and a Pa∣lace beautified with spacious Halls and Chambers, with a flat Roof, upon which some Pieces of Ordnance are planted: From this Place you will easily believe the Prospect cannot be unpleasant. Between this Court <HI>Boschetto,</HI> and <HI>Old Malta,</HI> lies <HI>Gardino del Vescone, The Garden of the Bishop.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Citta Vecchia</HI> may be seen a Grot of white, but soft Stone, wherein the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> after his Shipwrack, Preach'd: And three <HI>Italian</HI> Miles further,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court <HI>Balda.</HI></NOTE> the Court <HI>Balda,</HI> or <HI>Vassalo,</HI> extraordinarily frequented; for it hath an Orchard so fruitful, that the like is not in the whole Island; planted with many sorts of very large Grapes, white and brown Figs, and delicious Peaches, with a most delightful Fountain. A Mile without <HI>Valette</HI> lieth a Cloy∣ster, call'd <HI>St. Mattheo della Makkluba,</HI> where, upon <HI>St. Matthias</HI> day, a great Fair is holden.</P>
<P>Fifty or sixty Paces from that Cloyster, formerly stood the Town <HI>Makkluba,</HI> but now quite swallow'd up in Earth, nothing remaining but a Hole forty or fifty Fathom deep, and in the opening at the top, five hundred Paces in com∣pass.</P>
<P>Three Miles from thence, right over against the Island <HI>Forfala,</HI> you arrive at <HI>Gibel Ciantor,</HI> containing a Garden, and small Church, under which is a Cave, with a very fair Spring, furnish'd with a Stone Table, and Seat, for those that come thither to recreate and take their pleasure. From this place runneth a steep winding Way, from below, to the top of the Mountain; and from thence another, as rugged and rocky, to <HI>Boschetto</HI> before-mention'd.</P>
<P>The Ground,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strange power of the Stony Rocks.</NOTE> or rather the Rocks (which are most of them black, yellow, and soft, and therefore easie to be wrought) they say, that since the Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI> did that Miracle there, have been blessed, with producing certain great and small Serpents Tongues, of several colours and forms; as also of round Orange colour'd, and black Serpents eyes and Teeth, and certain Scaly Stones, in the form of a Serpents Skin; besides several other rarities, so shap'd, that they seem to represent the Life. These Eyes and Serpents Tongues, they say, have a wonderful vertue in them, against all sorts of Poyson, and Bitings of Venomous Beasts; not onely to preserve from the hurt, but afford a power∣full Remedy to such as have taken Poyson, or been bitten by any Venomous Creature; yea some have no less commended them than the <HI>Bezoar</HI>-Stone in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<PB N="751" REF="473"/>
<P>The manner of using these Stones, is thus; The Eyes are commonly worn upon the Ring-finger, as a pretious Stone, so that it may touch the bare Skin, and the Tongues upon the Neck and Arms, Water, or Wine, or some other moysture mingled therewith and taken, or therein for a while laid to steep, or else Wine or Water, drank out of Cups or Cans made thereof: Also the Stone of <HI>St. Paul's</HI> Cave, being very white and soft, hath the like vertue ascribed to it against all Biting and Stinging of Venomous Beasts.</P>
<P>The whole Island stands upon a Rock, so that no place can be found, where the Earth lieth more than four Foot deep; the best quarter is about <HI>Boschetto,</HI> and if the rest of the Island were as this, the Knights would not need to fetch their Provisions from abroad; yet notwithstanding the natural unfruitfulness, by labour and diligence, the Soyl brings forth many things, particularly Corn, but in no great abundance, for all will not suffice to feed the Inhabitants above three moneths; the rest they fetch from <HI>Sicily,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>Cummin, in the <HI>Arabick</HI> call'd <HI>Camum</HI> or <HI>Cemum,</HI> and by the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Malayan</HI> Tongue, <HI>Jenta Nyeran,</HI> they Sowe in great quantity, because it thrives, as delighting in a stony Soil. They have of two sorts, one white, slender and sharp, of a rank smell, and tart in taste, call'd <HI>Cimonageron,</HI> that is, wild Cum∣min, and like the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Cummin of the Apothecaries: The other much smaller, like Annise-seed, whitish, having a deadish taste, and sweetish. The first they use in stead of Spice, the other the Inhabitants mix with Bread, to give it a pleasant relish; from hence they are brought all over <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Also Cotton, as good, if not much better than grows any where else; onely we must observe, that the Cotton Planted here is but an Herb or Shrub, with a stalk of a Foot and half long, sown, and dying every year; but the other which grows in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and all over <HI>Assia,</HI> shoots up to the height of a Tree, with a Stem, and hard wooddy Boughs. The Fruit of this <HI>Maltesian</HI> Plant, grows to the bigness of a Hasle-Nut, those that are ripe split open into three or four sharp Wedges, out of which the soft white Wooll appears, inclosing within a slender white and Oily Seed, in taste like an Almond or Pine-Kernel.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants Sowe it upon the Barly-Land, after the Crop taken off, that is, in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> and pulled up in <HI>September.</HI> It groweth also in <HI>Lemnos, Can∣dia, Sicily,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> brought thither out of <HI>Italy.</HI> They say, the profit arising thereby every year, amounts to three hundred <HI>Cantares</HI> of Cotton, every <HI>Cantare</HI> being a hundred weight.</P>
<P>Many sorts of Flowers, especially Roses of a lovely smell, flourish here; be∣sides Thime, and all sorts of Herbs, of a most pleasant taste. And the Vines bear Grapes, as big as Plums, both white and red, which hang five Moneths in the year ripe on the Vine. They have also Olives, Almonds, very excellent Figgs, sweet and sharp Citrons, of an extraordinary bigness and beauty. Apricocks, and very large Peaches, besides Melons, Dates, and other Fruits, common in <HI>Europe.</HI> For want of Wood they burn the Dung of Beasts dry'd in the Sun, or wild Thistles: But some of the better sort use the Wood of Olive-Trees for Fuel, brought from <HI>Cicily,</HI> and sold by the pound.</P>
<P>The Villagers keep many Sheep, Goats, Hogs; Mules, and Asses,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> which serve in stead of Horses: Their working-Horses, to the number of about four or five hundred, are all Unshod, and fed onely with Straw and Fetches. Conies, and Hares, Partridges, and Quails breed here in great numbers; but Falcons and many other Fowl flock thither, especially in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> in great mul∣titudes out of other Countries.</P>

<P>The People of <HI>Bosio</HI> are of opinion, that not so much as one Serpent is found upon this Island, nor any other Venomous Creature; and that if any be brought from other places, they die presently. But <HI>Crusius</HI> affirms, there are Serpents and Scorpions, but without Poyson, caus'd by the Benediction of the Apostle, since his Shipwrack, and the shaking of the Viper from his hand into the fire; insomuch, that no person born in <HI>Malta,</HI> (others say also, of all Nations that inhabit there) can receive hurt from them; and confirm it by Occular Testimony, That several Persons, Young, and Old, have play'd with, handled, and held them to their naked Breasts and Bodies, without receiving the least hurt.</P>
<P>Men and Women of Quality,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloathing.</NOTE> go Clothed after the <HI>Cicilian</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> man∣ner; but the Villagers wear a small and single Coat, call'd <HI>Capotin,</HI> which co∣vers half their Thighs, with a Cape, and a blew Cap upon their heads; and some have Shooes of rough Goats Leather, ty'd with a Leather Point; but Fo∣raigners go every one Habited according to the fashion of his Countrey.</P>
<P>The Natives use a proper and peculiar Tongue,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> that is, broken <HI>Arabick,</HI> and every Town almost hath a peculiar Tone and Propriety: The Vulgar can speak no other than their Mother-Tongue, but the Citizens have learnt <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Their Marriages are made by giving of a Handkerchief, and the Bride and Bridegroom commonly lie together before the perfecting of Ecclesiastical Ce∣remonies.</P>
<P>They Bury their Dead after the <HI>Grecian</HI> fashion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burial.</NOTE> that is, hiring Mourners to follow the Corps, who for their small stipend, not onely make hideous Ulu∣lations, but tear their Hair, and scratch their Faces; the Friends cutting their Hair off, and casting it upon the Corps.</P>
<P>Most of the Inhabitants are poor,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches.</NOTE> because of the infertility of the place, and maintain themselves by Planting Cummin-seed and Cotton, which they ex∣change with those of <HI>Cicily</HI> for Corn, Wine, fresh and salted Flesh, Pease and Beans, Oil, and other Commodities.</P>
<P>The Countrey People use long Swords,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s.</NOTE> and great Daggers, Lances or Darts, not less than our Half-Pikes, which they use with great dexterity on Horseback; but the Knights have Muskets, and other Fire-Arms.</P>
<P>The Walls, Bulwarks, Breast-works; Cities and Castles, are Fortifi'd with great numbers of Ordnance, besides the beforemention'd Armory in <HI>Valetta;</HI> and seven well Rigg'd and stoutly Man'd Galleys, which the Knights of the Order always keep ready for Fighting, Commanded by an Admiral, who car∣ries a Silver Cross in his Flag, upon a Red Field; so that the <HI>Italians</HI> Proverbi∣ally say of this Island, <HI>Malta fior del Mundo,</HI> Malta <HI>is the Flower of the World;</HI> part∣ly in respect of their Arms, Fortifications, and Castles; partly because of the valiant Defenders, the <HI>Malta Knights,</HI> who have had their abode here many years.</P>
<P>They suppose at this day there are upon the whole Island Forty thousand Souls, the Knights and Souldiers included. In the Year Fifteen hundred and ninety, the number of them (according to <HI>Bosio</HI>) was no more than seven and twenty thousand, but since greatly increas'd.</P>
<P>In the two <HI>Burgs,</HI> lie near two thousand Men; the Knights keep about four hundred Horses to serve in the Wars, which every six Moneths are Train'd and Muster'd; besides, every Knight who hath four hundred <HI>Scudi,</HI> must keep a Horse in his Stable ready for service.</P>

<P>But for the better information of the beginning and continuance of this Or∣der of Knights, the Possessors and Lords of this Island, it will be necessary to deduce the matter somewhat higher.</P>
<P>When the City <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was exceedingly harrased by the <HI>Saracens,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The original of St. <HI>Johns</HI> Order, or <HI>Knights of Malta</HI></NOTE> who pos∣sess'd the same, <HI>Califf Aron</HI> used the Christians more gently, because of a good understanding between <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> first Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> and him; but after his death, this City fell into greater miseries, by quarrels between the <HI>Ma∣humetans</HI> of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> for now it was under the <HI>Persians,</HI> and then under the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who at last growing Masters of the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> treated the Christians very severely, and caused the Church of the <HI>Holy-Sepulchre</HI> to be Ruin'd, which remain'd seven and thirty years desolate, till the Raign of <HI>Con∣stantine Monamaque,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who Rebuilt it at his own Charge, with the consent of <HI>Bomensor, Califf</HI> of <HI>Bomansar,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Maabad Abuta∣min, Mustansir Billa,</HI> Son of <HI>Ali Taher,</HI> in the Year One thousand forty eight.</P>
<P>At the same time some Nobles and <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants of the City <HI>Amalfi,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> visited much the Havens and Sea-Towns of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> carrying thither by Shipping rare and precious Commodities, which were so acceptable to the Natives of that Countrey, that the bringers were re∣spected by all persons, even the Governors and <HI>Califfs</HI> themselves; by which means they had liberty to Trade every where, and visit the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the <HI>Holy-Land:</HI> But they having no Dwelling-place for their abode, nor any Church to exercise their Religion, concluded to intreat the <HI>Califf</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> to grant them a place in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> whereon they might build a Church, with a house for their abode, who immediately granted them a place near <HI>The Church of the Resurrection,</HI> where they afterwards built a Church to the honor of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> with a Cloyster and House. Afterwards they sent for from the Mountain <HI>Cassin,</HI> an Abbot, with <HI>Monks</HI> of the Order of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> to whom they gave the same Church and Cloyster, with a proviso to receive and enter∣tain all <HI>Christian</HI> Pilgrims or Travellers; and this Church was call'd <HI>St. Mary the Latin,</HI> because built by the <HI>Latin Christians.</HI> On the report of this Work be∣gun, many Men and Women betook themselves thither: And therefore that the Women might have a more honorable abode, another Cloyster was built, by the name of <HI>St. Mary Magdalene,</HI> into which a certain number of Religious Women betook themselves, to receive and entertain all Pilgrimesses which came thither. But when at last these Cloysters began to grow too small for such great numbers as thither resorted, the Sisterhood concluded to build a great Hospital or Alms-house, for entertainment both of Sick and Well; and put at the same time an Overseer therein, chosen by the Abbot. They built
<PB N="754" REF="475"/>also next it a Church, by the name of <HI>St. John Baptist,</HI> because they had under∣stood, That <HI>Zacharias,</HI> the Father of <HI>St. John Baptist,</HI> had often travell'd to this Place.</P>
<P>These Cloysters, and this Hospital, for want of Revenues, were only main∣tain'd by Alms, sent to them by those of <HI>Amalfi,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Italy</HI> which Traded in <HI>Syria;</HI> which continu'd as long as <HI>Jerusalem</HI> remain'd in the Hands of the Infidels: In which time a certain Holy Person, by name <HI>Gerard,</HI> was Overseer of this Hospital; and over the Cloyster of Women, a <HI>Roman</HI> Virgin call'd <HI>Agnes.</HI> When this <HI>Gerard</HI> had serv'd this Hospital a long time, he con∣cluded, with the Advice of his Benefactors, to take upon him the Apparel or Habit which the Knights at this day wear; that is, a black Cloke or Coat, with a white eight-pointed Cross upon it. The like the Abbess <HI>Agnes</HI> and their Institution was allow'd by Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the Second, and the Patriarch of <HI>Je∣rusalem. Gramay</HI> affirms, That at the intreaty of this <HI>Gerard,</HI> this Order was allow'd in the year Eleven hundred and thirteen, by Pope <HI>Paschal</HI> the Second, under the Discipline of <HI>St. Augustine,</HI> which hath been ever since follow'd by them: And likewise the same Pope <HI>Paschal</HI> took the same <HI>Gerard,</HI> and these Hospitallers (for so they were at first call'd, from this Hospital) under his Pro∣tection, and granted them great Priviledges, commanding, That after the death of this <HI>Gerard,</HI> they should chuse another Governor, to whom was given the Title of <HI>Master of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Megisser</HI> affirms, That when the <HI>Christian</HI> Princes had Besieg'd <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lorain,</HI> as Chief Commander, these Hospitallers joyn'd privately with him, and by means of their Assistance beat the <HI>Turks,</HI> and won the City, in the year Eleven hundred and nineteen. This <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> being afterward chosen King of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by the <HI>Christians,</HI> gave to this Order great Gifts, and put into their Hands the Government of many Towns, to de∣fend the same.</P>
<P>In the year Eleven hundred seventy eight, these Hospitallers fought with <HI>Sa∣ladine Caliph</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and won a great Victory; but with the loss of the Grand Master <HI>De Mozins;</HI> there remaining on the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> side above five thousand slain. In like manner, the Knights in the same year, in <HI>July,</HI> under the Com∣mand of the Grand Master <HI>Garnier,</HI> gave a bloody Battel to that Enemy, wherein <HI>Guy</HI> the <HI>Christian</HI> King of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the chiefest of the Realm re∣main'd Prisoners,

<P>The twelfth of <HI>October,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are drove out of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></NOTE> in the same Year, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was Conquer'd by <HI>Sala∣dine;</HI> by which means, all the <HI>Christians</HI> of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church, and these Hospi∣tallers, were driven out of the City, which with their own Money redeem'd above thirty thousand Prisoners. These did aid the <HI>Christian</HI> Princes very much, in the regaining of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> and the City <HI>Akre,</HI> which hapned in the year Eleven hundred ninety one, the twelfth of <HI>July,</HI> at which place they have since had their usual abode: And notwithstanding the loss of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the Hospitallers and Templars remain'd Masters over one part of the King∣dom of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and made <HI>Ameury van Ansignan,</HI> King of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> King of <HI>Jeru∣salem;</HI> but after his decease, the Knights and Templars govern'd it themselves, under the Grand Master <HI>Godfrey Rat,</HI> as Chief Commander.</P>
<P>About the year Twelve hundred twenty five, these Knights overcame the City <HI>Damiata</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> under the Conduct of the Grand Master <HI>Guerin de Mon∣taign.</HI></P>
<PB N="755" REF="475"/>
<P>In the Year twelve hundred and sixty, under the Grand Master <HI>Haegues de Revel,</HI> they took from the <HI>Saracens</HI> the Castle of <HI>Lebion;</HI> whereupon the <HI>Sultan</HI> concluded to destroy and root out all the <HI>Hospitallers,</HI> and to that end Besieged and took the Castle of <HI>Assur</HI> in the Year One thousand two hundred sixty five; and the following year the <HI>Hospitallers</HI> and <HI>Templars</HI> were beaten by the City <HI>Ptolemais,</HI> or <HI>Alkre,</HI> or <HI>Acon;</HI> three years afterwards they lost the Castle of <HI>Krak,</HI> or <HI>Montreol.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year Twelve hundred eighty two,

<P>The Knights betook themselves from thence to the Island of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> under the Grand Master <HI>Jan de Villices,</HI> where the King gave him and the <HI>Templars</HI> the City and Haven of <HI>Timesso</HI> for their abode.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the First, granted afterwards to this Order, all the Goods and Lands which they took from the Infidels; for which cause they gathered a strong Army, under the Command of the Grand Master <HI>Foulques Villaret,</HI> and took <HI>Rhodes</HI> from the <HI>Turks,</HI> with several other adjacent Islands; whereupon they remov'd from <HI>Cyprus</HI> to <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and were since call'd <HI>The Knights of Rhodes.</HI> About this time the Order of <HI>Knights Templars</HI> was suppress'd, and their Goods conferr'd upon these Knights by the Pope.</P>
<P>A long time they defended <HI>Rhodes</HI> against the assaults of the <HI>mahumetans,</HI> chiefly in the time of <HI>Habusar, Sultan</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who Besieg'd it five years; and in the Year Fourteen hundred and eight, the <HI>Grand-Seignior Mahomet,</HI> or <HI>Mihammed,</HI> attempted with an Army of Three hundred thousand Men, but was necessita∣ted to leave it with a great loss of Soldiers; but at last the <HI>Bassa Ibrahim,</HI> by the Command of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, overcame the City, and the whole Island in the Year Fifteen hundred twenty two, on the day of St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> having an Army of two hundred thousand men, whereof the Siege devour'd above a hundred thousand, whereas the Island was scarce furnish'd with six hundred Knights, and five thousand Inhabitants.</P>
<P>After the loss of this Island, they went away from it, according to the Agree∣ment made with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and Landed first at <HI>Castro</HI> in <HI>Candia,</HI> but went thence to <HI>Messina</HI> in <HI>Cicilia;</HI> and from thence, in the Year Fifteen hundred twenty three, to <HI>Civita Vecchia;</HI> thence again to <HI>Viterbo,</HI> a City in <HI>Tuskani,</HI> where the Pope en∣tertain'd them a while; they went from <HI>Viterbo</HI> in <HI>July,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred twenty seven, to <HI>Cornetto,</HI> from thence to <HI>Franche,</HI> and from <HI>Franche</HI> to <HI>Nize</HI> in <HI>Savoy:</HI> out of this, in the Year Fifteen hundred twenty nine, they betook themselves to the City <HI>Auguste</HI> in <HI>Cicilia,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Sarragoa,</HI> where they remain'd by leave of the Emperor <HI>Charles the First,</HI> who took a great content in them for their Valor, which they manifested every where, to the destroying of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Corsairs;</HI> insomuch, that <HI>Charles</HI> at last, in the Year Fifteen hundred and thirty, the four and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> out of a volun∣tary

<P>The intention of instituting this Order in the beginning, was to serve the Pilgrims which travell'd to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and to assist them with all their Power to keep the Ways secure for such as travel'd to visit the Holy Sepulchres. But at this day their chiefest business is against the <HI>Turk,</HI> and all Infidels, and to serve <HI>Christendom</HI> as a Buckler of Defence against them.</P>
<P>These Knights glory in themselves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter from the Grand Master <HI>Lackaris.</HI></NOTE> that they are an Order which hitherto hath had no other Foes, than those that are Enemies to the Name of <HI>Christ,</HI> be∣ing a renown'd as well as an admirable Institution, without advantage, or any other reward than that of Vertue, their probity continually exercising it self in the prudent Education of its noble Posterity, even with the hazard of their lives; and wishing nothing else, but to persevere in the shewing of their Valor in Fighting against the Wicked. They manage great Wars against the <HI>Turks</HI> and all Infidells, without joyning or confederating with any Party in the Quarrel of <HI>Christendome,</HI> and are by all <HI>Christian</HI> Princes known to be impar∣tial, being indeed an Order consisting of the flower of the Nobility of all <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> establish'd in the defence of <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, who by their glorious En∣terprises of a renown'd and Holy War, have five whole Ages approv'd them∣selves famous and honourable towards <HI>Christendom,</HI> and at all times formidable to their Enemies. They have in Services and Warlike Exploits so highly merited of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, Kings, and other <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, that they stand in a perpetual League with them, and have been receiv'd into the Prote∣ction of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, according to the purport of the Letters from the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth given and granted at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> the four and twentieth of <HI>May,</HI> in the Year Fifteen hundred and forty, where he saith:</P>
<P><HI>The aforesaid Order many years since, and even beyond imagination, have been a conti∣nual Defence against the Turk, that great Persecutor of our Faith, and have most valiantly spent their Blood against him for the defence of Religion, and performed many excellent Deeds; whereupon our Predecessors,</HI> Roman <HI>Emperors and Kings, have receiv'd them into singular Protection and Favor.</HI></P>
<P>The Popes, who confirm'd the Institution of this Order, held to be Tem∣poral and Secular, not onely in respect of their chiefest Employment, but for that they stand exempted both in their Persons and Goods, from the Power and Authority of the Clergy. All Temporal Princes and Lords in their Leagues with this Order, have always distinguish'd them from the Spiritual, neither are their Goods chargeable with Impositions as those comprised under the Colledges, or Cloisters of other Spiritual Societies.</P>
<P>This Order possesses in several Countreys of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Goods of this Or∣der.</NOTE> as in <HI>France, Spain, Por∣tugal, Germany,</HI> the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> many Houses and Goods of the Coun∣trey, call'd <HI>Commanderies,</HI> that is, <HI>Offices, Places, and Governments.</HI></P>

<P>Many times have the Knights requested of that State the appointment of these Commanderies, particularly the Grand Master <HI>Laskaris</HI> himself, by Let∣ters of the fifteenth of <HI>September,</HI> in the Year Sixteen hundred fifty two, request∣ed of the States, that by their Authority they might be admitted to the Baili∣wick of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the Commanderie of <HI>Haerlem,</HI> and other Goods, within their hands: and farther to that end sent Ambassadors to present their Case to the Assembly of the States, but could never reap any fruit of their Design. Over all the Goods in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>Hess,</HI> Grand Prior and su∣preme Master of this Order in <HI>Germany,</HI> hath obtain'd the Investiture.</P>
<P>These Knights set a high esteem upon their Rights and Priviledges, that they may employ them to the designed use in their Hospital, and the Holy War against the Infidels: and also for that they approve the honorable Re∣ward of their Order, for whose prudent and illustrious Deeds against the Infi∣dels, they say they were granted them.</P>
<P>The Knights of this Order are distinguish'd into several ranks:

Also <HI>Knights of Grace,</HI> or <HI>Favor;</HI> but they differ little from the first, onely that they cannot come to the Dignity of the great Cross, nor of Grand-Master.</P>
<P>There are Priests which celebrate Mass, but give Money for their recepti∣on into this Order; besides the Friers Servants at Arms, being Spiritual Per∣sons, wearing a Cross of Cloth upon their Cloak, but by permission of the Grand-Master, they may wear one of Gold: These are appointed to Offices, having small Commanderies under them, and obtain Place in the Order, after four Expeditions in the Galleys, or ten years abode in <HI>Malta.</HI> The Priests make but two Expeditions in the Galleys, yet there is but one of them in eve∣ry Galley, call'd <HI>The Prior of the Galley.</HI></P>

There is a Castle seated on a Hill; but small, and of little consequence; yet stored with a large number of Ordnance, and underneath defended by a Fort, newly strengthned in the year Sixteen hundred and eighteen, with a Bulwark.</P>
<P>The Island is a Peculiar of the Grand Master of <HI>Malta,</HI> who calls himself Prince of it, and sends thither one with the Title of Governor every three Years.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants, although they speak <HI>Arabick,</HI> nevertheless embrace the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Religion.</P>

<HEAD>The Island of Lampadouse.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Lampadouse,</HI> by the <HI>Italians</HI> call'd <HI>Lampedosa,</HI> and by <HI>Ptolomy, Lipadusa,</HI> lieth about five and twenty Miles West-South-West from <HI>Malta,</HI> in four and thirty Degrees North Latitude.</P>
<P>It remains desolate, and without Inhabitants. <HI>Ariosto,</HI> in his <HI>Orlando Furioso,</HI> represents this Island without Houses; but <HI>Cruzius</HI> affirms, That there are the Ruines seen of an old Castle, Houses, Walls, and Towers of Cities; but that none can remain there, because of a <HI>Nootlot;</HI> by which Word they seem to mean, Apparitions of Spirits, as the same <HI>Cruzius</HI> insinuates, when he says, <HI>The Place is every Night disturb'd and haunted with uncouth and mischievous</HI> Spectrums. However, this remains undoubtedly true, That there is a Church call'd <HI>St. Mary of Lampadouse,</HI> divided into two parts; the one part dedicated to the Reli∣gious of the <HI>Christians,</HI> and visited by Travellers, which come to offer there Money, Clothes, Bread, Gun-powder, Bullets, and many other things; the
<PB N="765" REF="480"/>other by the <HI>Turks,</HI> which also come there to offer, with like devotion in their way; but neither of these take away any thing of what is brought there, it being both reported and believ'd, That he that brings nothing, or will take any thing, cannot come off with such their Sacrilegious Pilferings. However, the Knights come thither with their Galleys, and take away the Gifts there left by the <HI>Christians,</HI> which they carry to <HI>Sicily,</HI> to the Hospital of <HI>Trepani,</HI> call'd <HI>Nunciata,</HI> for the maintenance of Sick, as well as Poor; or else to <HI>Malta.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Island of Linose.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Linose,</HI> by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> (if <HI>Sanutus</HI> guess not amiss) call'd <HI>Ethu∣so,</HI> and made <HI>African,</HI> lies seven or eight Miles, or according to <HI>Brevis,</HI> five Miles to the North-East of <HI>Lampadouse,</HI> in four and thirry De∣grees North Latitude, almost over against the City of <HI>Mahometa</HI> in <HI>Barbary:</HI> The Circumference about five Miles; but affording no convenient place to receive Shipping.</P>
<P>In the Year Fifteen hundred sixty five, the <HI>Turks</HI> besieg'd <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Gozo,</HI> with eight and thirty thousand Soldiers, and a hundred ninety three Ships, Galleys, Galleons, and Brigantines, under the chief Command of the <HI>Bassa Mustapha,</HI> and his Substitute <HI>Bassa Piali,</HI> in this order. The <HI>Turkish</HI> Forces ap∣pear'd the eighteenth of <HI>June,</HI> about four or five Miles from <HI>Malta;</HI> upon no∣tice whereof from the Castle, and the Old City <HI>St. Angelo,</HI> a great fear possess'd the poor People in the Countrey, who immediately betook themselves, with what they had, to the Fortifi'd Places; but the Knights, Soldiers, and other Warlike People, betook themselves to Arms. The Grand Master <HI>De Valette</HI> caus'd immediately all the Water on the Island to be poyson'd with Arsnick, or Ratsbane, and other appropriate Drugs; and muster'd all his Forces, consist∣ing of about eight thousand five hundred Fighting Men of all Nations; with one Troop of <HI>Banditi,</HI> or Exiles, of <HI>Cicilia,</HI> who behav'd themselves very vali∣antly. In the Night the <HI>Turks</HI> went out with a Rere-guard of five and thirty Ships, and set three thousand Men on Shore by the <HI>Cape of St. Thomas,</HI> who were follow'd continually by many others in Barques; for their Landing in the day-time was prevented by the Marshal <HI>Copier,</HI> who was drawn thither with a thousand Horse; but the Grand Master commanded him at last, That as soon as the Enemy was Landed, he should Retreat to the Fort; and sent the General of <HI>Gio,</HI> with a Troop of Knights and Foot-Soldiers, to impede their March. The Marshal, before he had receiv'd these Orders, had sent a Party of Horse, under the Conduct of one <HI>Egaras,</HI> to <HI>Mugaro,</HI> to get Intelli∣gence, and to entrap one <HI>Turk</HI> or other, in hopes to learn some News: But this prevented not their coming on, and making further Attempts; whereby, after many flerce Assaults made upon the Besiged, with the loss of many of their Men, the Besieged at last were reduc'd to Extremity; when in a lucky Hour, they receiv'd not only Comfort, but fresh Courage, by the coming of <HI>Don Alvaro Garcia,</HI> who after a long stay, provided with a good number of Ships and Soldiers, came in the sight of <HI>Malta</HI> about Noon, on the sixteenth of <HI>September,</HI> in the year Fifteen hundred fifty six; but kept till the next Break of day about the Island <HI>Comin;</HI> and then he approach'd with his Fleet under <HI>Malta,</HI> by a Place call'd <HI>Melekka,</HI> and Landed all his Aids in less than an Hours
<PB N="766" REF="481"/>time; but went back himself with his Galleys to <HI>Sicily,</HI> with promise to return again in six days. Hereupon both the <HI>Bassa's</HI> gave command to Fire all the Guns against the Fort, and the Island <HI>Sengle,</HI> and immediately to bring them on Board the Ships; and so presently forsaking their Trenches, and setting their Huts on fire, sail'd away with their Fleet. The <HI>Bassa's</HI> arriving at <HI>Galipolis,</HI> made their Adventures known to the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> by Letters, and how that since their departure from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> they had lost thirty thousand Seamen and Soldiers together. The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> receiv'd this Letter with so much discontent, that he threw it on the ground, and said with a loud voice, <HI>That his Sword had no luck in another Mans Hand:</HI> Yet notwithstanding, the <HI>Bassa's</HI> were receiv'd with signs of great Honor at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> with the Beatings of Drums, and Sounding of other Instruments.</P>
<P>The Pope also held a Solemn Procession at <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein himself in Person assisted, to thank God for the Preservation and Deliverance of <HI>Malta;</HI> and wish'd the Grand Master, in his Letter to him of the tenth of <HI>October,</HI> much Happiness with his Glorious Victory. The Grand Master <HI>Valette</HI> caus'd by a Collection to be gather'd at <HI>Lyons, Marseiles, Lovorn, Naples,</HI> and on other Pla∣ces, Gunpowder, Saltpetre, Metal for casting Guns, all sorts of Arms, Masts for Shipping, all sorts of Necessaries of Wood and Iron, and other needful Things, for the strengthening of the Island. Moreover it was concluded (for the better conveniency of the Island) to build a City on the Mountain <HI>Sceber∣ras.</HI> Towards the building of this City, since call'd <HI>Valette,</HI> thirty thousand <HI>Escues,</HI> or Gold Crowns, were taken up at Interest by the Order at <HI>Palermo:</HI> The Pope himself gave to that end five thousand out of his own Purse, and sent thither a great quantity of Gunpowder and Saltpetre, with a Master-Build∣er call'd <HI>Francois Laparel,</HI> and offer'd the Grand Master a Cardinals Cap; but he modestly refus'd the same. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> gave towards this Building a Present of thirty thousand <HI>Escues;</HI> the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> thirty thousand <HI>Cru∣sadoes;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, a hundred and forty thousand <HI>Guilders.</HI> Then im∣mediately, by the command of the Grand Master, all sorts of People were set to work upon the Fortifications, and to scowr and cleanse the Ditches and Moats, to which the Knights themselves put their helping hand: And from the Castle of <HI>St. Elmo,</HI> where onely before a Ditch had been, there was now a Moat cut in the Rock, down to the Sea.</P>
<P>The Grand Master being brought to the corner of the Bulwark <HI>St. John,</HI> af∣ter many Benedictions, and other Ceremonies, laid the first Stone of this Ci∣ty: Whereupon the Master-Builder <HI>Laparel</HI> kiss'd his hands, and had bestow'd on him a gold Chain with a Medal, which the Grand Master put about his neck. Under this Stone several Gold, Silver, and Copper Medals were laid, for an everlasting Mark and Remembrance of the Building, whereof the best had this <HI>Latin</HI> Inscription, <HI>Immotam Colli dedit,</HI> that is, <HI>He hath built the City immove∣able upon a Rock.</HI> On this first Stone Letters were cut, which manifested the utmost danger which they endur'd in this Siege, with the Happy Success, and their Deliverance; and likewise the Occasion and Reason of this Building, with a Prayer to God, and the Name of the Grand Master <HI>Valette</HI> the Founder. The same Grand Master presented the City likewise with a Coat of Arms, being upon a Round Scutcheon, a Field <HI>Or,</HI> charg'd with a Lion <HI>Gules:</HI> After which Ceremony, all the Guns round about were Fir'd, and Gold and Silver Money, Coyn'd with the Picture of the Grand Master, thrown amongst the People, who all cry'd, <HI>Vive le Grand Valette,</HI> that is, <HI>Long live the Grand Valette.</HI> The
<PB N="767" REF="481"/>Charges to the Workmen amounted daily to the Sum of fifteen hundred or two thousand Crowns; but to ease the Payment, and to make good the Char∣ges, the Grand Master caus'd Copper Money to be made: One Piece to the value of two <HI>Tarins;</HI> on the one side, with the Arms of the Order and the Grand Master; and on the other side, with the Mark or Ensign of his Digni∣ty, with these Words about the Border, <HI>Non Aes, sed Fides;</HI> that is, <HI>Not Coyn, but Fidelity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Island of Pantalaree.</HEAD>
<P>THis Island (which <HI>Mercator</HI> holds to be the <HI>Cossyra</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> but others, the <HI>Pacinia</HI> of the same Author) lieth between <HI>Sicily</HI> and the Main Land of <HI>Africa;</HI> or between <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> two or three Miles from the City <HI>Mahometa,</HI> right over against <HI>Susa,</HI> a City in the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis,</HI> in five and thirty Degrees North Latitude, according to <HI>Hues.</HI></P>
<P>It comprehends in Circuit about seven or eight Miles, and in breadth three or four. On the Sea-shore, toward the North side, lieth a City of the same Name with the Island, Fortified with an unaccessible Castle, built upon a steep and pointed Rock.</P>
<P>The most part of it appears Mountainous, full of great Rocks and Cliffs, yielding a glittering black Stone. In the midst of the Island may be seen an <HI>Abyss,</HI> or Bottomless-pit, call'd <HI>Fossa.</HI> The dryness of the Soil makes it unca∣pable to bring forth Rain: But it affords variety of Pot-herbs, abundance of Cotton, Annise, Capers, Figs, Melons, and excellent Grapes. There grow also little Trees, by the <HI>Moors</HI> call'd <HI>Ver;</HI> and by those of <HI>Sicily, Sinko;</HI> which bears a round, sharp, and red Fruit, but becoming black in ripening, of which the Inhabitants make Oyl, useful not onely to burn in Lamps, but to eat; wherewith the Women anoint their Heads and Hair, both for Ornament, and to make it grow thicker. There are no Horses, but Oxen in great numbers, with which they Till the Ground. These Islanders live hardily, and are dexte∣rous in Swimming; and although they use both the <HI>Arabick</HI> Habits and Lan∣guage, yet they have approv'd themselves to be good <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having penetrated the Center and Inmost Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> till of late altogether unknown; and accurately set forth the Circumference and Coasts of its vast Dominions; Describing exactly, and by good Authority, large Tracts of Land, hitherto not so much as once heard of, or in the least survey∣ed by the most Modern Authors: Our next Voyage (by Gods Conduct) we intend for <HI>America;</HI> hoping to receive that good Encouragement, that shall en∣able us to lead you through that New and Golden World, where you shall meet with the like, or more Variety of Wonders, than hitherto hath pierc'd any <HI>English</HI> Ear.</P>
