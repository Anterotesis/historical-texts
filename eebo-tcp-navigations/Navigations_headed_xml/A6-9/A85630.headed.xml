<HEAD>A GREAT VICTORY Obtained at SEA <HI>AND</HI> The Particulars of a bloudy fight between the Prin∣ces ships and the Parliaments, the number killed, sunk, and taken prisoners. And Capt. <HI>Whit∣tingtons</HI> Design to fall into the River of <HI>Thames</HI> with 15 sayl for the Prince, to burn and destroy all that will not come in unto him.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRince <HI>Charles</HI> hath given out severall Warants and Commissions to the respective Captains in their severall Commands and Duties, for their
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>putting forth to Sea, together with certain Instructi∣ons for the well ordering and carrying on of the pre∣sent design with the greatest advantage; and to the end that the work may prove more easie and facile, the extent of his mercy contains in latitude, the burning, killing and sinking of all that make opposition against him. But upon putting the same into execution, great was their opposition; for upon Capt. <HI>Wlison,</HI> Cap. <HI>Nye,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Colemans</HI> lancking into the <HI>Deep,</HI> they disco∣vered two Marchants ships, floting upon the Neptune, and making towards them, gave them a broad side, but the Marchants chusing rather to dispute action, then yeeld to submission, answer'd them again with round shot insomuch, that each man prepared for a conflict, the Deeks were well man'd, and Port holes open'd, the Trumpets sounded, and Canons ratled, and great was the gallantry of the Mariners on both sides; untill For∣tune seemed to frown on Capt. <HI>Noye,</HI> who soon recei∣ved a shot in the keel, which caused the ship imme∣diatly to sink, notwithstanding all possible means used for preventing thereof; but the Capt. &amp; many others, saved themselves by leaping into the Long-boat, and got safe to capt. <HI>Wilsons</HI> ship with the losse of 7 men, the other two seeing this, soon began to decline engag∣ment, &amp; being too swift of sayl, for the Marchants, got safe to <HI>Jersey,</HI> the Marchants steering &amp; hoysted sayl towards the Eastern Point, whose victory was great, for they had not sayled many leagues but they were again set upon by the Irish Pyrats, who after a sharp conflict boarded one, killed 20, took 30 priso∣ners, and forced the rest to the mercy of the Waves, with the losse of 9 men.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>We hear that a great Fleet is preparing for the Prince at <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &amp; <HI>Ostend,</HI> consisting of 16 sayl, each ship carying about ten pieces; they are said to be com∣manded by one capt. <HI>Whittington,</HI> an excellent Naviga∣tor, he hath received commission from the Prince, and hath had the sole ordering, disposing, &amp; manning of the Fleet; they are very gallant Frights for sayl, &amp; dan∣gerous to our English Creets, whose design (its said) is to come into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> to seize vessels, &amp; to burn, sink and destroy all that shall oppose them; The Governor of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is to have the tenth part of their prizes, and Prince <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth part. Captaine <HI>Rockes</HI> is said to be Vice-Admirall to the said Navy, with many other skilfull Pylots.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> hath lent them a great Colliers ship to make a prison of for the <HI>English-men</HI> she lies neer the Fort <HI>Madrick.</HI></P>
<P>Divers of the <HI>Ostend Pyrates</HI> have lately taken 14. Sayl of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> laden with Corn, Coals, and other Commodities, they carryed them to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> where they have made prize of all that was therein, and forced the Masters to buy their own ships.</P>
<P>But the Parliaments <HI>Bonaventure</HI> hath met with some of them, and boarded a new Ostender, taking ten pieces of Ordnance, and 30 men, she is now in the Downs, and many others are hastning thither.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VPon the Lord Governour <HI>Cromwels</HI> neere ap∣proach with his Army, to the frontier and im∣pregnable Garrison of <HI>Tredah,</HI> his Lordship hath sent a Summons to the Governour Colonell <HI>Ashton,</HI> for the surrender thereof to the power and obedience of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> but the Governour retur∣ned a very resolute and peremptory Answer, intima∣ting, <HI>That he abhord with his soul the brand of perfidi∣ousnesse, that he was resolved to display the banner of loy∣alty, and to stand is in the defence and preservation of the trust reposed in him to the last man, &amp;c.</HI> Whereupon, the Lord Governour immediatly called a Councel of Officers, for the well-ordering of the Army, to the end the work might appear more facile and easie, and in∣deed so excellent were the debates and consultations thereof, that their Design was lookt upon with great admiration.</P>
<P>And upon Saturday morning being the 8. of this in∣stant <HI>Septemb.</HI> twelve thousand Horse, Foot, and Dra∣goons, marched up in <HI>battell-array,</HI> with Trumpets sounding, and Drums beating against the Town, where they soon encamped themselves, cutting off divers pas∣ses, &amp; using the rarest stratagems of war, for streight∣ning the enemies quarters.</P>
<P>About 7 at night, the Army advanced somewhat neerer, and divers strong Guards both of Horse and Foot were placed within twice musket shot of the walls, where the Foot intrenched themselves. And a∣bout 5 in the morning, the besieged discovered us, who drawing neerer to each other, said, <HI>they would give us a dinner to welcome us into</HI> Ireland; and indeed they were very circumspect in keeping of their word, for between
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>11 and 12 they gave us a visit, sallying forth with a considerable party of Horse, and lining the obscure places with many hundreds of foot, but failed in their promise; for upon their first charg against one of our horse-guards, they were so gallantly received, that they soon quitted the place, our horse pursued them with∣in musket shot of their works, receiving a great volley from their Ambuscado, in which we lost 4 men, and 7 horse; of the enemy kild and taken 13. The next morning being <HI>Munday</HI> they attempted another sally, but not daring to put it in execution, retreated in a∣gain without action, remaining all day very silent, till the Curtain of the most high Canopy began to expell and darken the splendor of <HI>Sols</HI> beauty, who even at the close of the day upon the relieving our guards, gave us a volley both with great and round shot, which grazed and did no execution.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday</HI> being the 12. instant, Lieu. col. <HI>Ashton</HI> (a great Papist, and Nephew to the Governour) about two of the clock in the morning made a very despe∣rate salley upon two of our foot-guards, with 500. Irish, which by reason of the sudden surprizall of our Perdews, and Centinels, caused great difficulties to in∣tervene, yet notwithstanding, the Wings of providence seeming as a great Bulwark to preserve and defend us, our men received their furious onset, but being over∣powred, the Vau-guard retreated to the next, and bo∣dying, advanced to the other ingaged, fell upon the <HI>Irish</HI> killed 40, took 20 prisoners, and forced the rest to a dishonorable retreat, with the loss of ten; besides those in the former engagements, prisoners exchanged were equall, about 50. above 100 killed and wounded, wher∣of on our part 30.</P>

<P>Letters from <HI>Hamborough</HI> intimate, That Generall <HI>Montrosse</HI> lies with his Army there, and in the parts adjacent, they swear desperately they will be in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> before <HI>Christmas,</HI> (<HI>but thats uncertain</HI>) and boast themselves to be twelve thousand (<HI>but not half so ma∣ny</HI>) they want money exceedingly, and Charity seemes cold, which is ill rescented by the Souldiery; but their Generall is going to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> to negotiate with his Majesty (in the Name of his Soveraign) for monies, and other accommodation, &amp;c. <HI>but the Plume being fallen, the design seems dubious.</HI></P>
<P>They further write, That the Emperour of <HI>Muscovia</HI> hath set forth proclamation, prohibiting all the <HI>Eng∣lishs</HI> Marchants to depart his Territories, and not to trade any further, upon pain of confilcating all their Marchandize, unlesse they hrve Commission from the KING, either by Letters Pattents, or otherwise. <HI>This causeth a smile from the Royall party, who say, all Christian Princes will do the like, &amp;c.</HI></P>
