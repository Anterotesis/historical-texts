<HEAD>Some <HI>Considerations</HI> Humbly Offered, against Granting the Sole Trade to <HI>GUINY</HI> from Cape <HI>Blanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> to a Company with a Joint Stock, exclusive of others.</HEAD>
<P>A Company with a Joint Stock Exclusive, is a Monopoly; which has al∣ways been esteemed a great Grievance in matters of small Moment, and will be much more so in a Trade of so large Extent, and such vast Importance to this Nation, in the Export of its Woollen, and other Manufactures; and to the Plantations, in furnishing them with Negroes, by whose Strength and Labour all their Commodities which come from thence, as Sugar, Indigo, Cot∣ton, Ginger, Tobacco, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are produced, and whereby the Navigation and Re∣venue of this Kingdom is so greatly Increased.</P>
<P>And such a Company so established will have all the Mischiefs of a Monopoly.</P>
<P N="1">I. They will buy the Woollen, and other English Manufactures, proper for <HI>Guiny,</HI> at their own Rates, having no Competitors, and will sell all the Commo∣dities they import from thence into <HI>England,</HI> at what Prises they please.</P>
<P N="2">II. In such C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se they alone can carry such Negroes to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> as are fit for the English Plantations, which are only to be purchased between Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> and Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> and so will make their own Prizes for them, and impose what Terms they please on the Planters, as heretofore the <HI>African</HI> Company have done: and by buying Negroes dear, less of the <HI>West-India</HI> Commodities have been, and will be produced, and at greater Charge; whereby other Nations have already had an Opportunity, and have too well made use of it, to Vye with us in those Commodities; to the great Abatement of the Advantage of this Kingdom; and it may prove the Ruine of our Colonies: For if the Company have produced such Mischiefs by the Authority of a Charter only, What may be expected from them, if they should be established by a Law?</P>
<P N="3">III. Such a Company having no Competitors, will buy as Cheap, and sell as Dear as they please; and so will get as much by One Thousand Pounds, as would be good Profit to Private Persons trading with Three times as much; and there∣fore it is not their Interest to enlarge the Trade, but to get as much as they can by the small Stock they employ; whereas many Buyers would Enhance the Price of English Manufactures at home, and occasion a great Exportation of them, and lower the Price of Forreign Goods in <HI>England,</HI> and bring Negroes much cheaper to the Plantations, and thereby the Trade would greatly Increase.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>And though the Company now offer to content themselves to be limited from Cape </HI>Blanco<HI> to Cape </HI>Lopez,<HI> and to leave out </HI>Angola,<HI> yet that does not at all help the matter, for these Reasons:</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. It is humbly conceived, That all the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> have an Equal Right to all parts of the <HI>Guiny</HI> Trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Extent of the Coast between Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> and Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> is about 3000 Miles, besides up the Rivers in the Inland Country; and includes the whole Trade for Gold, Teeth, Dying Wood, and for such Negroes as are fit for, and de∣sired at the English Plantations: For although there are Negroes to be had at <HI>An∣gola,</HI> and such as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> like, yet the <HI>English</HI> will not buy them, unless a few for their House Service; they being a lazy sort of Negro, and very rebellious: And the safety of the Plantations depends upon having Negroes from all parts of <HI>Guiny,</HI> who not understanding each others languages and Customs, do not, and can∣not agree to Rebel, as they would do, and has by sad Experience been found, when there are too many Negroes from one Country.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"/>
<P N="3">3. This would exclude all the rest of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> from buying the Manufactures of this Kingdom proper for the <HI>Guiny</HI> Trade, very little of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Commodities being vended in <HI>Angola.</HI> For when a Ship is sent thithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in a whole Cargo there is not above 2 <HI>P<SUP>•</SUP></HI> Bayes 1 <HI>C<SUP>t</SUP></HI> weight of Pewter, 1 piece of Cloath, a few Musquets, some Anabasses, and about 5 <HI>l.</HI> value in Knives; all the rest of the Cargo are either Commodities from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> or Goods from <HI>Holland:</HI> Whereas in a Cargo for those parts, from which the Company would have the rest of their Fellow-Subjects excluded, there is sent from 1500 to 2000 pieces of Perpetuanoes, 150, or 200 peices of Sayes, 6 or 700 Dozen of Knives, besides great quantities of Gunpowder, Boysadoes, Welsh Plains, and Pewter.</P>
<P>And if it should be pretended, That the Company will furnish the Plantations with what quantity of Negroes they desire, and at such Rates as shall be thought Rea∣sonable by the Parliament, or any other Persons to be appointed from time to time, yet that would be no more than what they formerly engaged to do, when their Pa∣tent was granted by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and in a more especial manner for the Island of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> But it's to be Observed, That whatever fair and specious Pretences they made, they were far from performing them; and neither supplied the Plantations with the quantities of Negroes, nor at the prices they were obliged to do; nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould they hereafter comply any better with such an Agreement, if it should be made, for they know in case of their Nonperformance, the Planter would be no more able to Contend with their Joynt Stock now, then formerly, and the Governours of the Plantations, being the Companys Factors, the poor Planters must be content with their Treatment, whatever it be, because the Remedy to ob∣tain Redress, would be worse then the Injury they suffer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>As to the </HI>Forts<HI> and </HI>Castles<HI> whereby they pretend to have Recovered the Trade, and to have secured it to those they call </HI>Interlopers.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Trade to <HI>Guinea</HI> was greatest, when it was open, more Goods of the Growth and Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> were Exported for <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the Planta∣tions Better and Cheaper furnished with Negroes, than since the Company have been setled.</P>
<P N="2">2. At all the Chief Places of Trade for Negroes, there is neither Fort nor Castle.</P>
<P N="3">3. Where there is any Fort or Castle, they cannot secure the Trade, or annoy any one that would disturb it, out of the reach of their Guns.</P>
<P N="4">4. One or two Men of War would be a much better Security to the Trade than all their Forts and Castles.</P>
<P N="5">5. Although the chiefest Castle the Company have, belongs of right to the Na∣tion, and not to the Company, being taken by English Men of War, with the loss of the Blood of those that did not belong to the Company; yet that, and all others, were they more considerable might be paid for, and with ease Maintained by a Regulated Company, with a small Imposition on the Trade out of <HI>England,</HI> and on the Negroes Imported into the Plantations.</P>
<P>And that there may no room be left to doubt hereof, there are persons who will engage to Raise a sufficient Fund to pay for their Forts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to defray the fu∣ture Charge of Maintaining them, and will receive their Reimbursement out of the Duties which may be appointed to be Raised on the Trade, as it shall come in. And therefore it is humbly hoped, the <HI>Guinea</HI> Trade will be setled in that manner; and the rather, considering the great Discouragement those Merchants and Plan∣ters have lain under by the Mortality in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and the Earthquake at <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> and the great Losses which they have sustained in this War; and by the setling the <HI>Guinea</HI> Trade in a Regulated Company, Ingenuity and Industry would be Encouraged, that Trade would be Secured and Enlarged, more Gold and Goods from <HI>Guinea</HI> would be Imported into <HI>England,</HI> the Plantations would be better and cheaper supplyed with Negroes, whereby the Revenues of the Crown, and the Na∣vigation of this Kingdom would be greatly increased, and all the Inconveniencies and Mischiefs of a Monopoly would be avoided.</P>
<P><HI>All which is Humbly Submitted to the Consideration of the Honourable House of Commons.</HI></P>
