<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>18. FEBRUARY 1650.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<HEAD>A <HI>Declaration</HI> set forth by the Lord <HI>Lieutenant</HI> the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the Councell and assembly occa∣sioned from the view of a prin∣ted paper <HI>Entituled an Act prohi∣biting trade with</HI> the <HI>Barbados, Virgi∣nia, Bermudes</HI> and <HI>Antegoe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Lord <HI>Lieutenant Generall</HI> together which the <HI>Gentle∣men</HI> of this Councell and assembly having carrefully perused the sayd printed paper and finding therein matter so highly concerning the <HI>freedome, happinesse</HI> and <HI>wellfaire</HI> of this <HI>Islande</HI> thought it their duty to Communi∣cate the same unto all the <HI>Inhabitans</HI> of this place together which their <HI>observations</HI> and <HI>resolutions</HI> upon the same, and for the better and more methodical proceding therein they have first ordered the same to be publikly read as followeth.</P>
<P>Thus farre goes the sayd Act by which the meanest understanding may be sensible into how low an abject a bondage, the force of it would (if not prevented) reduce the <HI>Inhabitans</HI> of this <HI>Island.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB REF="2"/> I. For first <HI>they do Alleadge that this Island was setled at the cost and char∣ges of the People of England, and therefore ought to be subjected to the people of England.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly we all know that we the now <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this <HI>Island</HI> were and still are those People of <HI>England</HI> the which with great hazard of out <HI>persons</HI> and at our great <HI>cost</HI> and <HI>charges</HI> have setled and inhabited this place and shall we therfore be sub∣jected to the wills of those that stay at home? Shall we be bound by the regulations of the <HI>Parliament</HI> in which we have no <HI>representatives</HI> no <HI>persons</HI> there chosen by us to propose or consent to what is good for us or to oppose, or dispute what is not for our benefit or behoofe? certainly this were a Slauish im∣position beyond what Englishmen ever yet sufferd &amp; we doubt not but those courages which have brought us so farre from our <HI>Native Soile</HI> and found us out a living in these wild woods will still keep us <HI>freemen</HI> (whithout which) our lives will be but lothsome to us.</P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly <HI>it is alleaged you the inhabitans of this Island have by subtilty and force usurped a power of Gouvernment.</HI></P>
<P>Had we the <HI>Inhabitans</HI> of this <HI>Island</HI> ben heard what we could have sayd, this allegation had never been printed. But those who are designed to be slaves must not have the priviledge otherwise we could have sayd and most truly can &amp; do averr that the <HI>Gouvernment</HI> now if of force amongst us is the same that hath ben constantly <HI>adhered</HI> unto, and <HI>obeyed</HI> ever since the setling this place and given unto us by the same Authority which gave <HI>New England</HI> theirs, against whom the sayd Act
<PB REF="3"/>objecteth nothing, and this <HI>Gouvernment</HI> now obeyed here is the nearest moddell and ressemblance (now left in the world) of that admirable forme under which all our <HI>Ancestours</HI> of the <HI>English Nation</HI> florished for at least one thousand yeares past, &amp; therfore we shall conclude the rules of logick and discovrie to be strangly inverted, if the <HI>Continuance</HI> of, and <HI>Submission</HI> to the settled rightfull <HI>Gouvernment</HI> be adjudged an usurpation of new power, and on the <HI>Contrary</HI> an <HI>Vsurpation</HI> of a new <HI>Gouvernment</HI> and be held a <HI>Continuance</HI> of the <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Thirdly <HI>by the sayd Act all Forraigners are prohibited from holding any commerce with the inhabitans of this Island.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas all the old <HI>Planters</HI> well know how much they have ben beholding to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for their subsistance, and how difficult it would have ben (without their assistances) ever to have settled this place &amp; even to this day we are sensible what necessary comforts they bring us and how much cheaper they sell their <HI>Commodities</HI> to us then our owne Nation; but this comfort must be taken from us by them whose will must be our law: But we do <HI>Declare</HI> that we will never be so ungratefull to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for former helps as to deny them or any other Na∣tion the freedome of our <HI>Ports</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> of our <HI>Lawes</HI> wher∣by they may still (&amp; if they please) embrace a free <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> with us.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Fourthly to compleat our designed bondage, and make our necks willing to receive the yoake <HI>our owne Countremen are likewise prohibited from trade and correspondency with us and none to come
<PB REF="3"/>neare us but such as have a particular license, from some persons for that pur∣pose appointed.</HI></P>
<P>By which meanes it may come to passe that no <HI>goods</HI> or <HI>com∣modities</HI> shall be brought hither but such as those <HI>licensed persons</HI> shall please to be sold at the <HI>prizes</HI> that they shall <HI>impose;</HI> and no ships but theris arrive here, so that no <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this <HI>Island,</HI> shall be able to send home the <HI>Native Commodities</HI> of this place for their owne account but be as meerely slaves to that Com∣pany that shall have the sayd license as our <HI>Negroes</HI> are to us, they making theirs the whole advantage of our labours and industries here. And therfore upon the whole matter we do declare that as on the one side we will not be wanting to use all the <HI>honest honorable,</HI> and <HI>moderate</HI> meanes we can for the conti∣nuanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a <HI>free trade</HI> and faire <HI>correspondancy</HI> with our native countrey; so on the other side we will not so much degenerate from the ancient candour of true <HI>Englishmen</HI> as to prostitute those <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Fredomes</HI> (to which we were borne) to the will and pleasure of any: Neither do we thinke our <HI>numbers</HI> so <HI>contemptible</HI> or our <HI>resolutions</HI> so <HI>weake</HI> as either to be <HI>forced</HI> or <HI>per∣suaded</HI> to so vile a <HI>submission.</HI></P>
<P>And we can not imagine that there is so meane &amp; base minded a fellow amongst us, that will not perferre an honorable <HI>Death,</HI> before a <HI>Tedious</HI> &amp; <HI>slavish life:</HI></P>
