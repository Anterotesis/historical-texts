<P>ON <HI>Thursday</HI> last, Arrived here two Dutch-Men of War from <HI>Tor∣bay,</HI> being sent from our Fleet by Admiral <HI>Russel,</HI> with Or∣ders to Cruise between the <HI>Dead-Man</HI> and <HI>Ʋshant,</HI> but they at present remain here for a Wind.</P>
<P>This day Arrived here the Spanish <HI>Alliance,</HI> in 7 days from <HI>Corronna,</HI> she carries 26 Guns, and is very well Man'd; in her way outward, she met on the 6 Instant with a French Man of War of 23 Guns, who had with her as Prize, an English Ship of 300 Tuns, bound home from <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> very Richly Laden, and which she had taken some days before; when the French-Man of War and <HI>Alliance</HI> came up with each other, the former (after a few Shot) not liking the Game, soon quitted the Engagement, making all the Sail she could away, by which our Frigate soon Retook, and possessed themselves of the <HI>New-England</HI> Man, and in her a great many French Seamen Prisoners.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P>On the 14th, They came up with a French <HI>Snow,</HI> a sort of Privateer so called of 18 Guns and as many Parteratoes, who being extraordinary well Man'd, held a Brush with the <HI>Alliance,</HI> between 5 and 6 hours, but having her Main-Mast brought by the Board, and most of her Rigging miserably Shattered and Torn, she had recourse to her Oars, of which she had 36, by the help of which she got clear, but as they hear, was a te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣wards Stranded.</P>
<P>On the 10th Instant Arrived at <HI>Corronna</HI> the Spanish <HI>Expedition,</HI> she brought in with her a Dutch <HI>Fly-Boat</HI> of 250 Tuns, very Richly Laden, and a French Ship of 80 Tuns, both which she took from a French Privateer of 20 Guns; after considerable resistance.</P>
<P>On the 17th Instant, The Spanish <HI>Alliance</HI> came out of <HI>Corronna,</HI> in Company of a Dutch Privateer of 26 Guns, and they both made a mutual agreement, that whatever Prizes should be taken by them in their Voy∣age to <HI>England,</HI> they should be equal sharers. In their Voyage they gave Chase to a French-Man of War of 30. Guns, but could not come any nearer to her, then just reach her with there Chase Guns; soon after they came no with a French Merchant-Man of 16 Guns, and 300 Tuns, Bound from <HI>Martinego,</HI> and very Rich, which they took, after a very small Resistance, and sent her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Flushing</HI> in <HI>Zealand.</HI> This Ship came out in Company of 21 Sail more, under the Convoy of 3 Men of War, the Admiral of which, as they Declared, carried 60 Guns.</P>
<P>Here are lately come in, about 15 Sail of Stragling Ships from <HI>Virgi∣nia, Antega, Martinego,</HI> &amp;c. The former came from <HI>Virginia</HI> on the 20th of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Daniel</HI> Commander of one of these <HI>Martinego</HI>-Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age about 80 Leagues <HI>West</HI> of the <HI>Western-Islands,</HI> had the boldness to give Chase to a French Vessel of 100 Tuns and 10 Guns; and after a sharp Dispute took, notwithstanding the Ship seemed to be of a better Force than his, but he is a bold daring Man.</P>
<P>These Successes has so Flushed our <HI>Packet-Boats,</HI> that they are Resolved nothing shall miss them that they are any ways capable of Mannaging; and that they are resolved every Man to Perish, rather then suffer there Ships to be taken. This is all that offers at present, either for News or Trade, from your Obliged Friend and Servant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
