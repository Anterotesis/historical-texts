<OPENER><SALUTE>MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Doubt not, but that you will in the highest manner Admire, when you shall understand the <HI>Treaty,</HI> lately Concluded on by the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the most <HI>Christian KING,</HI> and the <HI>PROTECTOR</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and the Honorable LORDS, <HI>John Baron</HI> of <HI>Gaunt, John Baron</HI> of <HI>Merode,</HI> and <HI>John Baron</HI> of <HI>With, &amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>Deputies of either <HI>Province:</HI> And considering that they are determined to leave Us, and to deliver Us over as a <HI>Prey</HI> to our <HI>Blood-thirsty,</HI> and unpacified <HI>Enemies</HI> of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> That is, that Generous <HI>Holland,</HI> who hath placed Us in the very middle of the <HI>Pikes,</HI> and would that We should Embrace that fair-seeming <HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Kingly</HI> City hath for the space of Eleven Months together been Besieged, many of Our <HI>Ilands</HI> have been Incorporated, great part of Our <HI>Countrey</HI> spoyled to the Ground, many of my <HI>Subjects</HI> have been Murthered, and Tyrannously dealt withall; <HI>Men per</HI> force taken from their <HI>Wives, Children</HI> Estranged from their <HI>Mothers,</HI> and the most part of Our <HI>Castles, Buildings,</HI> and <HI>Houses</HI> destroyed by Fire; And that for no other Reason, but that they cannot sufficiently be sa∣tisfied with the <HI>Blood</HI> of Our <HI>People,</HI> no Con∣sideration taken of their Oath made to <HI>Almighty God,</HI> upon that <HI>Peace</HI> which was formerly Con∣cluded on. Finally, all this <HI>Cruelty</HI> is forgotten by Our Confederate <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> who joyntly fall from Us for fear of a <HI>War</HI> with the <HI>English;</HI> And therefore Concludes such a <HI>Treaty,</HI> Giving Us a <HI>Law,</HI> without any Notice given to Us, or at least; to be Heard or Understood by Our <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>much less without the Consent of Our <HI>Allies,</HI> or <HI>Confederates:</HI> Likewise all this tends much to the Prejudice of their Powerfull <HI>Alliance;</HI> And the many <HI>Promises</HI> by them made for Our Assi∣stance. Now instead of Helping and Assisting Us, in bringing all Things to honourable and reasonable Conditions; They have con∣trary to their <HI>Promises,</HI> maintaining of their <HI>Glory,</HI> and Our <HI>Finall Well-being,</HI> They have wholly forgotten that we ought to have good <HI>Recompence</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> for the Fireing and Plundring of Our <HI>Country,</HI> and for the Violating of Our <HI>Subjects,</HI> and <HI>Riots</HI> by them Commit∣ted; where to the Contrary, with this most cursed <HI>Cessation,</HI> they bind up Our <HI>Kingly Power</HI> and <HI>Hands,</HI> and the <HI>Hands</HI> of Your most <HI>Illu∣strious Highness</HI>'s, who joyntly Depended upon those <HI>Succours</HI> which they expected from the <HI>Ne∣therlandish Fleet,</HI> and are now dis-enabled to work out that <HI>Designe,</HI> which was to Transport o∣ver Our <HI>Armies,</HI> and to Chase away Our <HI>Ene∣mies</HI> from Our <HI>Kingly</HI> and <HI>Metropoliticall CITY:</HI> What a High <HI>Blame</HI> is this, that they should both <HI>Swear</HI> and <HI>Promise Succours,</HI> not so much for Us alone, but for their own <HI>Ruine</HI> and <HI>Confusion,</HI> by the Interest of the Sound, of their own <HI>Forces,</HI> and Couragious <HI>Officers,</HI> who they have Cast
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>into the very <HI>Throat</HI> of that Devouring <HI>Beare:</HI> All seems to leave Us, they Consent, and force all to Cease; Giving full <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> to that Great <HI>Enemy,</HI> who to that End hath United all his <HI>Forces</HI> to make use of his <HI>Blood-Thirsty Sword</HI> against Us, and Our <HI>Subjects.</HI> It is ap∣parent, that <HI>God</HI> is Angry, and that he Deprives <HI>RULERS</HI> of their <HI>Understandings,</HI> to Chastise <HI>Countries</HI> for their <HI>Offences.</HI></P>
<P>Most <HI>Illustrious PRINCES,</HI> This is a great <HI>Burthen,</HI> and it would have been far better for such <HI>Allies,</HI> or <HI>Confederates,</HI> not to have Incensed, or provoked Me so far as to Wage <HI>War</HI> against the <HI>Swedes.</HI> But they seem first of all to hold the <HI>Swedish Power</HI> in a <HI>Ballance,</HI> and now they throw My <HI>Kingdome</HI> into his <HI>Scale,</HI> and will likewise Surrender your <HI>Highnesses</HI> Themselves to the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> Intending to make an <HI>A∣greement</HI> apart with the <HI>CROWN</HI> and <HI>STATE</HI> of <HI>POLAND:</HI> And to the Contrary will Be∣neficiate the <HI>Swede</HI> with such <HI>Treaties</HI> as shall pos∣sess Them of the <HI>Sound,</HI> and so Consequently to make Him sole LORD of <HI>EUROPE.</HI></P>
<P>May it please your <HI>Highnesses</HI> to take Notice, how Hainous a Thing this is in the Eyes of <HI>God,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>and how Destructive it is. Such a <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Cessation</HI> hath been made, and Concluded on, by the <HI>Deputies</HI> of the <HI>LORDS</HI> the <HI>States</HI> in <HI>Holland:</HI> And yet it hath been worse Acted in <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> by their <HI>Ambassadour Nieuport,</HI> who hath Commanded the <HI>Hollands</HI> ADMIRALL to prolong the said <HI>Cessation</HI> for Three Weeks; who hath Obliged Himself in <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> to cause the same to be Ratified and Approved of, by his <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Principalls:</HI> Insomuch, that now the <HI>Netherlandish Power,</HI> which is so Burthensome to their Own <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> that it is now become Noysome; And in the mean time, the <HI>Swedes</HI> lay Hold of All.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Highnesses</HI> may be pleased to take the <HI>Pre∣misses</HI> into your Mature <HI>Considerations,</HI> and to con∣tinue and remain Obliged to your <HI>Oathes</HI> and <HI>Fi∣delities,</HI> to Maintain and Uphold Unity, and with all Speed to Agitate therein, according to the <HI>Designes</HI> Contained in these <HI>Charecters</HI> herewith going: Not doubting, that although <HI>Holland</HI> leaves Us so absurdly, and that They Oblige Them∣selves by the said <HI>Treaty,</HI> upon the Refusall of Our Acceptance, of the <HI>Agreement</HI> by Them made, in Lieu of the <HI>Assistance</HI> which They have Sworn unto Us, to force Us to it with their <HI>Fleet,</HI> but
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>that the <HI>Almighty</HI> will Himself Fight for Us in De∣fence of Our <HI>Good Cause,</HI> who will <HI>Crown</HI> your <HI>Sacred</HI> and <HI>Annoynted Heads</HI> with Triumphant <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> and <HI>I,</HI> as <HI>David,</HI> and a Person left Destitute, shall with my <HI>Citizens</HI> Humble Our Selves before that Great <HI>God,</HI> and Depend upon Him alone, and then We shall in his most Holy <HI>Name</HI> Go Out, against that <HI>Swedish GOLIA;</HI> And if it should please <HI>God,</HI> that We Fall by the <HI>Sword,</HI> Our <HI>Wives</HI> shall set the <HI>City</HI> on Fire of all Sides, and shall depart from thence with the re∣maining <HI>Ships,</HI> where <HI>Christ</HI> in his <HI>Mercy</HI> shall Conduct Them, who will take your <HI>Serene High∣ness</HI>'s into his most <HI>holy Protection,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
