<HEAD>A great and glorious Victory obtained a∣gainst the Hollanders, upon the Nor∣thern Seas; with the particulars thereof, and the manner how the Parliaments Frigots fell upon the Convoy and Mer∣chants, as they were passing to the Irish seas, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hough no Tongue or Pen be able to express the greatness of the ac∣tion, suitable to that magnificent appearance of God, in the behalf of poor England; yet because it is a main part of our duty, in any measure, to become
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>subservient to his glory, it is conceived no∣thing can more advance it, then by recount∣ing before all the world, the many wonde∣rous and mighty dispensations of his mer∣cy.</P>
<P>For upon the 30 and 31 of Octob. the waves at sea roul'd high and tempestuous; for the windes were at a sad contest of Ma∣stership for 48 hours together, so that our Navy were necessitated to draw neer the Harbours; however the very storms provd advantagious to us; for a Squadron of the enemies ships passing by the Isle of Wight, were by the force of the tempest scattered and divided, and in that disorder 4 of them were driven in upon Gen. Blake, who wil∣ling to entertain all the smiles of fortune, most courteously embraced their inevitable reducement, and has sent them all prizes in∣to the Downs. Two Merchant men since
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>laden with wines and other rich commodi∣ties, partaking of the same disaster in wea∣ther, are taken in like manner, and now on sail towards Dover for Winter-quarters, 7 ships more pretending themselves Ham∣burgers, were likewise taken by the States Frigots, and conveyed to Plymouth, where they are at present, till such time that they can make it appear that they are not Fle∣mins, otherwise to expect to be made pri∣zes. Three more likewise upon the Coast of France were brought in by the Pelican to the fleet, under the same pretence of Ham∣burgers; but unless they prove it suddenly, and by sufficient demonstration, they must look for an inimical Censure. Yet that which doth most illustrate the splendour of our Victory, is, the dissipating of the Dutch Convoy, with 100 sail of Merchants, neer the Isles of Orkney, by Cap. Ball, with 20 Men of War.</P>

<P>General Blake maintains the Western seas, and expects the coming forth of the Dutch Fleet very suddenly. Vantrump hath tendered an Oath to all his Officers and Sea-men; and unanimously they have vow'd to dispute their Quarrel upon the Ne∣ptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Ocean to the last man. But it is the Muzzle of the Canon, and not such Squibs must resolve our Case.</P>
<P>Two hundred sail of Colliers are now bound from Newcastle for London; they put forth on the third of November, and are daily expected at the Hope.</P>
<P>On Munday being the eighth of this insta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, we received intelligence, That Sir George Carteret is very busie with his Pickeroons upon the Western Coast, seizing divers small Vessels, but sometimes they snap short of their prey; and instead of prize receive shipwrack. Amongst the rest, a gallant ship richly laden with plunder'd Plate, and other famous Commodities, was bulg'd upon the Sands neer Co∣rum in Kent, and became a prey to the Inhabitants thereabouts: she is by estimation deemed to be worth forty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Great are the preparations for War throughout all the Provinces; but the most active and forward
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>to engage are the English: Yet there is a people who are loath to run the hazard of War, knowing that it is not a little Ghelt must feed the flame, and want of Trade will soon make a hole in the bottom of their purses. And so I leave them between Hope and Despair: God knows the future Events, and not I.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, the Estates now prosecute their Design with great vigor, and have paid the Sea-men off all their arrears, so that there is a gene∣ral concurrence of their Mariners to be in action once more; and their whole Navy are now ready to launch forth. The Lords have mustered 30000 able and expert men of Armes, out of which 5000 were selected to man the Navy. The interest of the King of Scots is eagerly prosecuted amongst them; and all the talk is, of his Cause, and Advance, to pal∣liate their new Design The King of Denmark hath sent a Declaration to the Estates General, assuring them of his readiness to joyn with them, for the ad∣vancing of the King of Scots interest, provided they would play the like Game; which they seem very forward in, to run an apparent hazard of the fortune of their own Commonwealth to hold the contesta∣tion with ours. Thirty men of War are coming
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>from the Baltick seas to joyn with them; from whence we hear, that the King hath sent a summons throughout all his Dominions, in obedience where∣unto, there hath been a great mustering of the Mi∣litia, and a great Army is drawn down towards the Sound; so that there seems to be a mighty compli∣ance of both sides in heightning their war and con∣spiracy against us. We hear that his Maj. of Den∣mark hath sent the King of Scots one hundred thou∣sand pounds for a Present, with the promised assist∣ance of Him and His Subjects, in the disputing of His Cause against all Opposers.</P>
<P>In pursuance whereof, He hath broke open the English ships by him detained in the Sound, and is resolved to prosecute the Quarrel, which gives a se∣cond occasion of joy to the Hollanders, in regard they suppose it is an engagement upon him to stand to his affront: But there is a Judge above, that must censure these actions, beyond whom there is no appeal, and in whom, no perverting of Judg∣ment.</P>
