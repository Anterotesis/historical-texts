<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORK Designed, OR THE SCOTISH ATLAS To be Published.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mongst the many Sciences, which perfite and adorn the mind of man, <HI>Geography</HI> is worthy of all praise: because it both affordeth matter of much delight, and likewise is of much use for the life of man. This World being a Theater, whereupon each act their Part, and by the several Personages, which they represent, very much demonstrate the marvellous Wisdom, Power and Goodness of GOD, who hath contrived all for the perfection of the Universe his great Work, and by his never erring Providence bringeth all about to the accom∣plishment of his good will and pleasure: Man, who is the lesser World and Abridgement of the Greater, cannot but find the advantages of <HI>Geography,</HI> by which we see all the parts of this great Machine, even which are most remote from us, and look upon these who are absent, as if they were present with us. What delight must it give us, when we learn by it the Situation of Coun∣treys, Towns and Rivers, as well as if we had viewed them with our eyes! It is certain that most of men have a great desire to travell, and it is certainly an inexcus∣able fault to be ignorant of what concerneth our own Countrey: Yet many, because of their poverty or want of health, are deprived of these Advantages. And therefore we are much beholden to <HI>Geography,</HI> by which all the face of the World is exposed to us, and we can even sitting at home view the whole Earth and Seas, and much sooner pass through them in our studies, than Travellers can do by their Voyages; and so may, without the hazard of being infected by the vices of Forreiners, improve our minds and reap all other Advantages from them. Not to mention here, how the Policy of each place, the studies of <HI>Theology,</HI> of <HI>Natural Philosophy, History</HI> and several Arts may be improved by this knowledge. I shall only instance in <HI>Merchan∣dising, Navigation</HI> and the Pactice of <HI>Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>And for <HI>Merchandising,</HI> (which with <HI>Navigation</HI> is the great support of corpora∣tions) it can hardly be entertained without the knowledge of the Countreys and their Products, of the nature and manners of the Inhabitants and Rodes that lead to them, which the Maps and descriptions joyned to them inform us of; and by the Maps the Mariners come to know the situation of the Countreys they intend for, the Rout they are to follow and the Dangers they are to be aware of.</P>
<P>As for the Practice of <HI>Medicine, Hippocrates</HI> hath abundantly proven, that a Physician, who would practise aright, must first know the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de Aë∣re, Aquis &amp; Locis.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now considering these great uses of <HI>Geographical</HI> Descriptions, many complained that there was so little done, as to the Description of our Countrey: For the <HI>Theater</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> published by <HI>Bleau,</HI> for all its Bulk (except it be the Description of some few shires by the learned <HI>Gordon</HI> of <HI>Straloch,</HI> and some sheets of his of the <HI>Scotia</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<HI>Antiqua</HI>) containeth little more than what <HI>Buchanan</HI> wrote, and some few Scrapes out of <HI>Cambden,</HI> who is no friend to us in what he writeth. And in respect that there are many Islands around this Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and many impetuous and contrary Currents and Tides, and in several places the Coast is full of Rocks, or Banks of sand, which ought to be exactly described for the security of Trade. And because the face of the Country, by the peace and quiet we enjoy under his <HI>Majestie's</HI> happy Government, is quite changed from what it was of old; and now for Stately Buildings, Parks, fertile Fields, we begin to contend with the happiest of our Neighbours: therefore a new and full description was much desired by all ingeni∣ous persons.</P>
<P>For these considerations His <HI>Sacred Majesty,</HI> the Father of his Countrey, and gra∣cious and wise provisor of all that may be for the profite and honour of it, hath com∣manded and ordained, by His Letters patent under the Seal, Sir Robert <HI>Sibbald</HI> one of His Phisicians in ordinary and His <HI>Geographer</HI> for His Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> to publish an exact description of <HI>Scotland Ancient and Modern,</HI> with the Maps. And, that the Maps may be exact and just, the Lords of His <HI>Majesties</HI> Pri∣vy Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> gave Commission to <HI>John Adair</HI> Mathematician and skilfull Mechanick, to survey the Shires. And the said <HI>John Adair,</HI> by taking the distances of the several Angles from the adjacent Hills, hath designed most exact Maps, and hath lately made an <HI>Hydrographical</HI> Map of the River of <HI>Forth</HI> Geometrically surveyed, Wherein, after a new and exact way, are set down all the Isles, blind Rocks, Shelves and Sands, with an exact Draught of the Coasts, with all its Bayes, Head lands, Ports, Havens, Towns, and other things remarkeable; the Depths of the Watters through the whole <HI>Firth,</HI> with the Courses from each Point, the pro∣spect and view of the remarkable Islands, Head-lands, and other considerable land∣marks. And he is next to survey the Shire of <HI>Perth,</HI> and to make two Maps there∣of, one of the south-side, and another of the North. He will likewise be ready to de∣sign the maps of the other Shires, that were not done before, providing he may have sufficient allowance therefore. And, that these, who are concerned, may be the bet∣ter perswaded thereto, there is joyned with this Account the Map of <HI>Clackmanan-Shire</HI> taken off the Copper-Plate done for it, where may be seen not only the Towns, Hills, Rivers and Lochs; but also the different face of the grounds, which are Ara∣ble, and which Moorish: and by convenient Marks you may know the Houses of the Nobility and Gentry, the Churches, Mills, woods and Parks &amp;c,</P>
<P>In obedience to His <HI>Majesties</HI> command, the said Sir Robert <HI>Sibbald</HI> printed <HI>Que∣ries</HI> for obtaining the Information that was necessary for the Description of each Shire; and hath been at the pains to collect several Manuscripts Ancient and Modern, which may illustrate the said work; and hath recovered several Ancient Inscriptions, which were never published before; and hath now made that advance in the work, that if the rest of the Informations from the Shires be sent in shortly, and these few Shires be designed, which are not yet done, this Description in <HI>English</HI> (whereof this is the Account) may be very soon ready for the Press. For the further encouragement of these, who may be Subscribers for the Copies, it is fit there be some Account of it given, which is as followeth.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Atlas Scoticus</HI> or <HI>Description of Scotland Ancient and Modern</HI> is to be in two Volumes; the one in Latin, the other in English.</P>
<P>The Atlas in <HI>Latine</HI> may contain about an hundred printed sheets of large <HI>Lum∣bard-Paper,</HI> in the great Letter the <HI>Atlas</HI> is usually done upon: &amp; it will contain some seventy Maps, whereof there are upwards of twenty more than are in the <HI>Thea∣trum Scotiae</HI> done by J. <HI>Bleau</HI>; and of these several are exactly surveyed. In this <HI>Lati∣ne</HI> Copy the <HI>Scotia Antiqua</HI> will take up more than twenty sheets of Print, and is done exactly from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, and the best Manuscripts and Ancient Records. The contents of the several Books are set down in the <HI>Latin</HI> Account pre∣mised.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotia Moderna</HI> likewise is done in <HI>Latin,</HI> according to the account given there, so it remains that there be ane account given of the <HI>Atlas</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> which is to be published first.</P>
<P>The <HI>Atlas</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> in <HI>English</HI> may contain eighty sheets of printed large <HI>Lum∣bard</HI> paper, and about seventy Maps. It is divided into two parts, the General and the special part. The General part Containeth the general description of
