<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce the Defeat given to the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> neer St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> the Lord Mar∣shal <HI>Turein</HI> advanced with two thou∣sand Horse towards <HI>Paris;</HI> which the Lord Marshal <HI>de Hospital</HI> (Governor of the City)
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>perceiving, commanded the Gates to be shut, and the Trained Bands to be in readi∣ness; by which timely Allarm, the Citizens were soon in a posture of Defence; and upon the neer approach of the Cavalry, a considerable party of the Citizens were commanded forth, who gave a gallant Onset, but received a great Repulse; for the Kings Horse charged with such an irresistable re∣solution, that they quickly made good their way through the very thickest of the young Infantry; and upon their countermarching charge, galled them so extremely with small shot, and Lances, that they immediatly dis∣sipated them, breaking their Ranks, and for∣cing them to retire into the City with many crackt Crowns: This blow proved very dis∣advantagious to the Parisians, by reason that the Kings party gained an opportunity here∣by to block up the City, and to intercept provisions from any pass whatsoever. And hath also now begat a Treaty, for a rendition of the said City: which if it prove effectu∣all, by all consequence it appears, that the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>rest of the Garrisons will soon submit, and finally a general peace to be established. The King hath sent for the Lord <HI>Dighy</HI> from the Governm, of <HI>Mantes,</HI> to confirm a great∣er Title of Honour upon him; so that his Lordship hath left Sir <HI>Lewis Dives</HI> Gover∣nour for his Majesty.</P>
<P>Gen. <HI>Harcourt</HI> is advanced with his Army neer to the City of <HI>Burdeaux,</HI> with a Design, to make a sudden and general Assault; for he hath gained a great advantage of the Ene∣my, and hath drawn most of his forces be∣fore it. He hath a very considerable Army, consisting of about twelve thousand foot, and three thousand horse, which are most of them quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered from the Suburbs to <HI>Reolle,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Nerai.</HI> The Duke of <HI>York</HI> (so called here) is in great favour with the <HI>French Cavalry;</HI> and as his Actions gaineth honour, so doth his Name purchase Fame; for since he received the sole Command of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> he hath performed singular service in three several fights.
